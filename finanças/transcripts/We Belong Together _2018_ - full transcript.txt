It's like torching every relationship that's ever meant a damn to you. I left that dear, sweet baby in his dirty diaper. And after all that, I still ain't put that damn bottle down. This is a safe place. This is a haven from-- from the world outside. There's-- there's no judgment here. Today is a very, very special day for him, because today, he earns his 90 day chip. Thomas. My name is Thomas Lewis. And I'm an alcoholic. Hi, Thomas. You know, I can speak to a classroom full of 200 students, but every time I come up here, it's like I'm sweating bullets. Means 13 months ago, I was finalizing my divorce. In a short amount of time, things look so different, I feel clear. I'm grateful my ex-wife is finally allowing me to see my daughter unsupervised, which means I don't have to look over my shoulder at the social worker looking at me like I'm a criminal. Do you have a bag? Brittany. It's my daughter's name. Things go well, then she gets to spend the night with me. Because of you, I'm-- I'm planning on having ice cream with my daughter. Dad! Hey, how you doin'? - Dad! - Oh. Oh, I missed you. I missed you. Look at you. I'm sorry I'm late. Hey, sweetheart. Go ahead, go play. You know what? I'll let you know when it's time to go. Wow. This kid's got so much energy. They're hype. They're making me hyper. You remember having this much energy as a kid? No, I don't know anybody that has as much energy as she does. 90 day chip. Just like I promised you. I'm surprised you went through with everything this time. Oh. Look, I-- mm, I didn't mean that. No, no, it's fine. Hey, Brittany. Let's go. Let's go. I got a surprise for you at home. Bye, guys. Ooh, a surprise? Is it a phone? Well, how are you gonna find out unless you get in the car? Yes. - Bye, mom. - Bye. Have fun, honey. Um, be sure you have her in bed by 9:00, okay? Yeah. And look, Thomas. I didn't mean anything. No, no. Look, it's fine. Thanks again. - I'll see you tomorrow. - All right. Wish me luck. And where did you say this high school was again? Fairbanks, Alaska. Oh. My dad was in the military. Oh, okay. Because I've just never seen a transcript like this before. Is that gonna be a problem? No, no. It shouldn't. Here's your schedule and map of the campus. And welcome. Cool, thanks. Hey, there. How can I help you? My name is, uh, Professor Thomas Lewis. For those of you in the back, that is-- Professor Thomas Lewis. Now, in, uh, broad strokes, we will be covering various ancient mythologies from around the world. But before I get started, I'd like to introduce you to my assistant, your TA, Leslie. Please stand and tell the class a little bit about yourself. Of course. Hi, everybody. That's me. I've known Thomas for quite a while. I've taken this course before, so I have a pretty good idea at what I'm doing. If you guys have any questions, you guys need help with anything, please feel free to ask me. I'm here to help. Okay? Now, if you're looking for her work hours, they're in the syllabus right under mine. Well, speaking of syllabus, who in here doesn't have one? Raise your hand. Would you help me, and, uh-- Yeah, of course. --with the back, and I'll take care of the front. All right, now. All right. Now that everybody has their syllabus, let's get into this mythology. All right, isn't it about a hero's journey? Let's find this hero's journey. All right. You guys need help with something? Cool. What's up? Um, so I don't really know what this is saying, um, but I can go ahead and ask the Professor if he can help us. Professor Lewis, can you come over here and help us - for a second, please? - Sure. Okay. They need help with this one. - If you can-- - Okay. Well, you know what? Disregard that. Just go to chapter one. All right? Excellent. You are so smart. No, no, no. I appreciate it. You're the smart one. I really appreciate-- you know-- I mean, I'm happy to be back in your class. Oh, I'm happy to have you. Yes. Um, so I'll catch up with you later? - Okay. - All right, cool. Jerk! You okay? Yeah, I'm all right. In his defense, uh, he did kind of honk his horn. I can't hear nothin' with these on, so maybe he did. You're in one of my classes, aren't you? Yeah. How are you liking it so far? I mean, for the first day it was cool. It was cool. Okay. Well, that's good. I see, uh, you're job hunting, there. Yeah. I, uh, need a job. Well, I don't wanna impose, but, uh, do you mind if I make a suggestion? Go ahead. Well, a couple of blocks from here is a diner called Sal's. I usually go there a couple of days out the week after class. Best steak and eggs I've ever had. Owner's name is Julio. Great guy, could always use some help. That's, though-- well, of course, if you don't mind getting your hands dirty. No, I don't mind at all. Good. Tell him Thomas Lewis sent you. All right, cool. Thanks. All right. And, uh, I think you should look both ways when you cross. It's a good thing. All right. I'll see you in class. Yeah. Hi. Hi. Hi. That's me, Leslie. I already took this class. So I already know everything. And I know it all. And I already know Professor Lewis. Hmm. I'll get the ones in the back. Frequent theme in all mythologies is the correlation between love and loss. Heart-wrenching passion and death. Hello, Miss Jacobs. Please, have a seat. Sorry. Your hair looks nice, by the way. Thank you. Love and death is a constant trope used in all mythologies. A character is allowed to find their one true love, allowed to be with them for a certain period of time. Then, for one reason or another, tragedy strikes. And the two are torn apart. If you look at the Greek story allegory of Orpheus and Eurydices, or Isis and Osiris. Or even in the modern biblical parable of Sodom and Gomorrah. In it, Lot had worked, tirelessly, to save the city. But even in the end, it is his own wife that is turned into a pillar of salt. Hey. Professor Lewis? Hey. Hey, Tracy. What can I do for you? I just wanted to say thanks again. Besides saving my life last week, you recommending Sal's was a good thing. I got the job. I started yesterday. Good. Congratulations. Thank you. Guess I'm gonna have to go down there and order a steak and eggs special. Oh my god, I would love that. I usually work Wednesday night-- Hey, Tom, I had a few questions about the papers that I was given yester-- Oh, I am so sorry. I didn't realize you guys were-- I apologize. I didn't mean to interrupt. Oh, go ahead and finish. No, it's-- it's cool. We're-- we were finished. Well, congratulations again. I'll see you next class. Okay. It's a cute lip color, though. Um, yeah, so apparently I'm gonna be here late tonight between discussing the paper with the students and my own readings that I have to do for-- Yes, yes. I know another long night, but I really need you - to take care of this for me. - Okay. No problem. - Thank you, Leslie. - Got it. Help! I'm sure you all heard about what happened to Leslie already. Needless to say, today's class will be canceled. Please, uh, come in. Uh, these, uh, detectives would like to have a word with you. Thank you, Mr. Lewis. This is my card in case any of you have heard anything or have any details regarding Leslie's murder. We also have a photo of the potential suspect that was captured on the security cam. I'll make sure to make some copies and hand them out. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Lewis. Thank you. Hold on. Come in. Hi. Hope I'm not interrupting anything. No, no. Please. Come in, have a seat. How can I help you? Actually, I was coming to check up on you. Very kind of you. I'm still trying to process all of this. You know? Leslie was a great person. She didn't deserve what happened to her. Well, listen. If it makes you feel any better, I'd like to offer you a steak and eggs dinner on me. I mean, at this point, I kind of owe you my life. You gotta let me repay the debt somehow. Maybe another time. Right now, I don't have much of an appetite. Okay. Well, I have another favor. Leslie was giving me rides home from work. She was so sweet to help me out for that. I should've known something was wrong when she didn't respond to my texts. I'm sorry, I had no idea that you two had gotten that close. Yeah, I went to her to ask her for help on a paper. And from there, she let me open up to her and she offered to help me. It sounds like Leslie. Always going the extra mile. I'm-- I'm sorry. Yes-- You know what? I'm sorry. - I shouldn't have asked. - No. - It's inappropriate. - No, no, no. It's fine. Uh-- What time do you need me to pick you up? Well, I get off at 9:00, but if you come in at 8:30 I can have that steak and eggs plate ready for you. Sounds like I'll be there at 8:30. Great. Ah, right on time. Just how I like it. Go ahead and sit anywhere. Okay. Thanks. I've got your steak cooking right now. What side would you like? Toast and hash. Okay. You want something a little stronger than water? I've got a little personal stash in the back. No, water's fine. You sure? Could be our little secret. I don't drink. Never? Or not anymore? Anymore. Interesting. I'll be right back. I'm not doing this. What the hell are you doing here? Get up. Get up and go. I-- I-- Ah, food's here. I had them prepare your steak medium well, and your hash browns will be right out. Uh-- looks perfect. Good. What a long, weird, twisted day, right? So how's work coming along? It's as pleasant as working any night shift in a diner could be. I'm like Cinderella around here. It's very glamorous. So what'd you do before this? Before the diner? No, before LA. I'm sorry, I saw on your resume that you worked a few places out of town. Ah, I was in the military, stationed in Germany. And then I did two years in Iraq. Wow. Thank you for your services. Yeah, I guess. Listen. You better eat up before that gets cold. Yeah, um-- Mm. You were right. That is good. Oh. You're blushing. That's cute. I'm gonna check on your hash browns and let you finish. I have a few things to do around here and then we can go, okay? This is me right here. Hey, thanks again, Professor. It's like you're always saving me. Call me Tom. Don't worry about it. I was a college student once. So, Tom, are you full? I'm stuffed. Might as well try and get to a bed ASAP. Sounds like fun. No, I-- look, I didn't mean it like that. You're blushing. Again. Tracy, you're a beautiful girl. I'm 26. I'm far from a girl, okay? I'm sorry. You're a beautiful woman. But I'm practically twice your age. And? And not to mention, you're also my student. It's not illegal for us to enjoy each other's time, Tom. No. No, it's not. But it is unethical. And if anyone was to find out, then, like, I could lose my job. Look, I'm-- I'm gonna be straight with you. I'm just coming off of what was over a year long sabbatical. So I can't afford to be a part of any scandal. I can keep a secret. Listen. I think that you should reconsider. Okay? I just got back and, um-- I really can't do this. I just got back. And, um-- wait, I-- look, uh-- stop. Stop. All right? Uh, this can't happen. Well, I can feel that you're not gay. So what is it? You married? Or divorced? Divorced. Well, clearly, you're not over it. But that's okay. If you need help getting over it, you know where to find me. You still love her? Right. Megan. Come on. I just need to talk to you for a second. Thomas, is that you? Thomas, what the hell are you doing here? Look, I'm sorry. I-- I've been calling Megan on the phone. She's not picking up. I need to talk-- Honey, it is after midnight. Yes, I know. I just need to talk to her for a second. - Mom, mom, mom. - Wh-- what? - What? - I-- no, I have it. - Let me-- I got this, mom. - You sure, honey? Yes. Thank you. Alright. Thomas, what the hell are you doing here? When'd your mother move in? What do you want, Thomas? You know, Brittany's asleep upstairs, not to mention the fact that I have two houses to show in the morning. Look. I just need to talk to you for a second. Can I come in? What do you want, Thomas? I miss you. I just want to know if we're working towards something, towards fixing us. Fixing us? Is that what you've been worried about, Thomas? Fixing us? Look, I-- I know I wasn't there for you when you needed me. Look, Thomas. I used to beg you to worry about fixing us before we were broken. But you don't even remember that because you were too blackout drunk. You know why I drank. Of course I know why you drank. I never blamed you for what happened and I never will. You're a good father. But what I will blame you for is what happened after. Because that bottle became your shoulder to cry on instead of me. Where was my shoulder, Thomas? Where was my shoulder? Megan, I-- You know what? You really even shouldn't be worried about fixing us right now. What you need to worry about fixing is that little girl that's sleeping upstairs. Repairing her memory of seeing her father coming in in the middle of the day, all the time, blackout drunk. Okay? You fix that, Thomas. Fix that. Okay? Fix that. Tell Diane that, uh, I'm sorry for waking her. - Thomas. - No. It's fine. Hey. The hardest thing in the world is to reject the man you love. Mom, I can't-- Oh, honey. No, don't cry. Come on. I know, baby. It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right, I promise. Okay? It'll be all right. Knock knock. Tracy. Uh, Miss Jacobs. Professor Lewis. Didn't see you in class today. I couldn't show my face in there after what happened the other night. You know what? Why don't we just forget it? No. I was inappropriate. And you were being the perfect gentleman. Can't forget it. Look, we all do things we shouldn't have done. Sometimes we make mistakes we regret. I didn't say I regretted anything. I mean, you're cute, you're smart, you're single. An opportunity presented itself and I took it. Miss Jacobs. Listen, I'm just saying my offer still stands. You forgot what it feels like to be desired. Look, uh-- This has gone far beyond appropriate. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. No. I'm not stupid. I know you want me. It doesn't matter what I want. It's the only thing that matters. Hey. Oh, sorry I took so long. Oh. Ooh, I spilled this on me. Do you have napkins? No, no. We have napkins right, uh-- What is this? Let me get that. Is this her? Your ex-wife? She's pretty. Yeah. That's her. Oh, my gosh. Is this your daughter? She is adorable. She's your twin. Let me-- let me-- Tom, I thought you said you only had one kid. I do. Megan named him after me. I was excited to have a junior. He was a great kid. Then one summer, Megan, my ex-wife, she had to go out and show some houses and, um, she left me with the kids. I remember Brittany, she was taking a nap, and I put Junior in the crib. I can't remember, you know-- did I put him on his side? Did I put him on his back? It go-- it goes and plays over and over in my head. But I-- I can't remember. But I remember the phone rang. It was my publisher. He was all excited about my new book. Projected sales, all kind of nonsense things like that. I remember I had a few glasses of wine. And I'm thinking, like, man, I don't know. Maybe it was an hour. But when I look back, it was like an eternity. Because when I went back in that room... he was blue. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. SIDS. That's what they call it. Happens in one in every thousand infants. And my-- Junior, he-- he had to be the one. You know, there's two things-- Two things that'll haunt me for the rest of my life. And that's... seeing my son blue in that crib. And then to tell his mother and look in her eyes. And tell her, your son... our boy, he's gone. He's gone. You know, she never accused me. Not one time. Not one time. Never said one accusatory word. But she didn't have to. No. I did that all by myself. You know, I couldn't face-- I couldn't face her. I couldn't face my-- my daughter, Brittany. All I could do was drink. I had to drink. Malt liquor, drink that. Vodka, drink that. Tequila, I don't want no shots. Drink that. It's all I knew that would allow me to look at myself in the mirror every day... and Megan, she-- she tried. She tried. But all I knew was to push her away. Push everyone away. Megan, she had to realize she had to take care of herself, and-- and Brittany. And three DUIs later, and a little stint in jail, well-- She gave me divorce papers. 1:36 PM on a Thursday. She gave them to me. I signed them. Didn't even look at it. I signed away my rights to my daughter because I knew... they were better without me. And I was better without them because, you know, at least I had the bottle. Took me six months to get up enough courage to go to AA, and... another three months to stop drinking. So this is what you want? To never drink again? It's the best. Yeah, bro. So you say, um, she's your student? Bro. Have you lost your mind? No, c-- man, you know what? I knew you were gonna say that. That's why I didn't want to tell you. You damn right I was gonna say that. Because you have lost it. I didn't pursue her. She pursued me. Meh, I didn't pursue her, she pursued me. I don't care who pursued who, man. Wait. Wait, how old is she, man? Please don't tell me she's 18. She's not 18. Well, how old is she? Look. There's something about this woman. It's like she's exactly what I need right now. Oh, she exactly what you need right now. But is she 18? She's 26. What you need is a swift kick in your ass right now. That's what you need, man. What if the faculty finds out that you sleeping with one of your students? Then what happens? Maybe I get reprimanded or suspension, ma-- maybe worse. Shh. So it's worth risking all that, huh? Come on, man. Look. You're not just my AA sponsor, all right? You're my best friend. So you know everything about me. This is the first woman that I've been with since Megan. Look, look, I'm talking... raw, animalistic distraction. - All right. - Wait, wait, wait. - Wait. - You talkin' 'bout... Raw, animalistic distraction. - There you go. - All right, I get it. All right, all right. Okay, I understand. I-- I get it, all right? But I just-- just be careful, man. Alright? Hey, you know what they say, right? The easiest time to start a new addiction... is when you getting over an old one. - Food for thought. - Food for thought. Yeah. From my AA sponsor who brings me back to my old watering hole. Drink your water. Okay, all right. Totally not a big deal. You sure we're gonna make our reservations? Yes, I'm sure. I just need 5 minutes, 10 minutes tops. I just gotta freshen up. You know you're perfect as you are, right? Thank you. Give me 5 minutes. Go sit down. Hey. Is this a picture of you? Yeah. Why is it I never noticed it before? You come in here and you go straight to the bed. You don't notice anything in here. When'd you take this picture? It was taken the night my parents died. What? Not a big deal. I was five years old. I barely remember. All I know is there was a fire. I made it out. They didn't. Some jerk photographer took my picture, and there it is. You have any siblings? Nope. Just me. So what happened to you after your parents died? I moved from foster home to foster home until I turned 18. I decided to go in the military. Why is it that I'm just finding out about this? Because I was trying to avoid these awkward conversations. And now that you know everything, can I finish getting dressed? Yeah, yeah. Thanks. You know, I could just imagine that-- Please. Do you knock? What's that? Come on, come on. Give me-- let me see. I'll open it for you. Clozapine. What's that for? Goodness. All right. What's going on? Come on. Talk to me. Well, if you must know, they're antidepressants. I suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder from being in the military, and a doctor prescribes them for me. Okay. Well, I guess I'm learning all kind of new stuff about you tonight. It's not that bad, really. I just hate taking them because I start feeling weird and foggy, almost like I'm not my natural self. Come here. It's all right. You're an amazing woman. And I'm in awe of you right now. Really? Absolutely. After all that you've been through, pulling yourself up by the bootstraps. Look, if those pills, they make you feel like that, then I'm sorry. It's a shame. Because I enjoy getting to know the natural you. You do? Of course I do. I think we should stay in tonight. You do? Yeah. I have a surprise for you I've been wanting to give you anyway. So I'm gonna go get ready for the surprise. You get in the bed, and I'll get your surprise ready. Surprises. I like surprises. - You like? - Oh, yeah. I like. Lay down. And what are you gonna do with those? These are part of my surprise. Are you nervous? I don't know. Should I be? No. Maybe a little. So. You ready for the surprise? I hope this is nothing to do with a feather because it's unmanly how ticklish I am. It's not feathers. Okay, close your eyes. - Open your mouth. - Hm? What? Open your mouth. Open it. What are you doing? I'm being your serpent in the tree. You know you want it. And I won't tell anyone, especially your ex. No. Stop. Why? Because of some AA pledge? They don't know anything. They just tell you to suppress your urges. Life is about giving in. You can be free here. I want you to be your true self. So have a drink with me. I won't tell anyone. Hey. What you doing out here? I was looking all over for you. Did you get my note? No. I didn't get your note, but I saw you through the window. This is amazing. I come out here. I like to feel the wind. This is my safe place. Clear out all the noise in my head. Mm. Well, your safe place is, um, not that good for my migraine. You got a hangover? Yeah, I guess you can call it that. I need some Aspirin or something. What time you got? 12:42. I got to get out of here. What's wrong? I'm late. Late for what? Well, uh, need to pick up my daughter and take her to swimming lessons. And, well, it's gonna take me at least 30 minutes and go home, change up, I should take a shower. All right, well, let me dressed. I'll go with you. Well, no. No, no, no. I'm good, I'm good. Look, I, uh, I couldn't find my phone. Where'd you put it? It's on the side of the bed. Why is it that you don't want me to be around your daughter? It's like you don't want me to meet her or something. - Why? - Come on, really? Because. Because? Because is not an answer. Because why? It's a little too early for all of that, don't you think? I mean, I got a 10-year-old daughter who's already wondering why her daddy's not there tucking her in. Now she's going to wonder why I'm 30 minutes late or more, just to take her to swimming lessons. The last thing I need to do is add another adult in the mix so she has more questions to ask. Okay? No. It's not okay. It's gonna have to be. Because you're not gonna meet her. Come on. Give me a kiss. I got to go. Come on. All right. Talk to you later, all right? I got to-- I got to get out of here. Thomas. You're late. Brittany, your dad's here. I missed an appointment because of you. Megan, I'm sorry. I-- I got caught up-- Dad, you're late. You made mom miss an appointment with a new client. You sound just like your mother. Don't let it happen again. And are you still gonna take me swimming? Well? Brittany, go get the swimsuit your grandmother gave you, okay? Yes! Megan, um, I just want to thank you again for this. I know you didn't have to do this. What's going on with you? You okay? Uh, yeah, well, I'm worse than some, better than most. And wh-- what is this? What? To be more dressed down than normal? Come on dad, let's go. - Come on. - You guys have fun. Bye, mom. Bye, honey. Oh, uh, I'll have her call you before she goes to sleep tonight. Okay. Okay, Tom. Maybe I overreacted a little bit this morning. Just call me back, okay? Silence is not how we solve problems, Tom. Call me back. Who the hell do you think you are? How dare you ignore me? I can destroy you. I'll just invite myself in. Look. All right, I don't want to argue with you again, all right? Me neither, crazy. That's not what I'm here for. I came to give you a gift. What's this? It was my father's. It was the only thing that survived the fire. I can't take this. Listen. I really, really overreacted the other day. You don't deserve that. So I wanted you to have this so you can know how much you mean to me. It's an apology gift. Look, Tracy. I accept your apology, but I cannot take this. Are you just gonna forget about all the hundred calls you made and the-- and the-- the 30-something voice messages you left me? Huh? Hold on. Hey, baby. What's going on, Brittany? Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Slow down. No. All right, look. I can't understand you. No-- I-- Diane, what's going on? Oh. Oh, okay. Oh, my god. All right. All right, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm on my way right now. Okay, I'm leaving. Bye. What's going on? Megan was in an accident. She's in the hospital. Is Brittany okay? Yeah, she was with her grandmother. I have to go. We can go to the hospital together. No, no, no. Whoa, whoa. No, no. You can't come with me, all right? - We've been over this. - I'll go with you. No, no. No. I got to go to the hospital. You got to leave. Well, we're not finished here. I'll just wait here until you get back. I-- I don't have time for this, all right? Look, I got to go. Lock up the door behind you. Thomas. Thomas. Dad. Oh, come here. Mommy's hurt. Really bad. I know, baby. I know. So she just came out of surgery. She had some, um, broken bones and internal bleeding. And, oh, honey, I know. I'm right here, baby. They caught all that in time, but right now they're just worried about the swelling in the brain. So they had to put her in a medically induced coma. Hey, ho-- coma? Yeah. They don't know how long it's gonna take. Like, days, weeks, I don't know. We just got to-- we just got to hope and pray. Hey, hey. Daddy's right here. All right, babe? All right? It's okay. Stay with Nana. It's gonna be fine. Oh, honey. Don't cry. Please don't cry. You're gonna make Nana cry. Okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thomas. Thomas. Good morning. I must have dozed off. - Good morning. - Morning. What time is it? I-- I got to get Brittany to school. Already taken care of, my love. Thank you. Ain't nothing but a thing. We all family here, honey. And thanks for this. Honey, why don't you just go on home? I'll call you if anything changes. Mm-mm. I can't get any rest with her in here. Not like this. Well, you're not gonna do her no good if you end up in the bed right beside her, honey. Please, listen to me. Go home. Take a shower. Lay your head on a pillow and get some winks of sleep, and then come back here nice and refreshed. You're gonna do yourself and Megan a favor. Maybe you're right. You know I'm right. Okay. Diane, you know I must have apologized to your daughter over 1,000 times for what I did to our marriage. But, uh, I know after our divorce you had to step up. I never got to say thank you. I'm sorry. Matthew 18:21-22. I'm not familiar. "Then came Peter to him and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me before I forgive him? Till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I do not say unto thee, till seven times. But until 70 times seven." I knew you were sorry as soon as it happened. And I forgave you way back then. But it's way past time. You forgive yourself. Please. - I got to go. - I know. - I'll be back. - Okay. Tracy, Tracy, Tracy. What are you doing here? How was the hospital? How's Brittany? What have you been doing? This. I moved this chair here so I could be right here when you got in. Fine. Get up. Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on, really? Moving all this stuff around. Rearranging my stuff. I mean, what? You've been here for the last few days while I've been away? I just wanted to make sure you were okay. How's your ex-wife? Did she die? What'd you say? Why would you say something like that? Oh, Tom. Because I care. I care, Tom. I was worried about you. I was really worried about Brittany. Just stop. No, really. - Just stop. - What? Look, I-- I-- I just can't entertain this anymore. What are you saying, Tom? I'm saying that we're done. This is it. We're through, Tracy. All right? I don't have the energy or-- or willingness to even entertain your antics anymore. - No. - Yes. No. No. No. No, no. Look, the only priority I have right now is to my family. All right? Not to anyone else, and that includes you. Was your family a priority when you killed your son? I didn't mean that. I didn't mean that. - I'm sorry. - Don't touch me. - I was out of line. - Just stop. I was out of line. I didn't mean it. - Don't touch me. - I'm sorry. - Look. - I'm sorry. - Get out. - I didn't mean to say that. - We can talk about it, Tom. - Look. Get-- Look-- - Let's talk about it. - Get out. - Let's go. - Let's talk about this. I said get out. I want you out. You're hurting me. Ow. I want you out of here, all right? No. Tom. - Let's-- - Get out. Tom! And stay the hell away from me. We need to talk about this. Tom. We belong together. Please. Please. Baby. Baby, if you could hear me... I need you to wake up. I need you to wake up. I can't imagine being in this world without you. Brittany needs you. I need you. I love you. I love you so much. I love you, too. - Megan? - Oh, my god. Megan. She's awake. Megan. - Oh, thank god. - She's awake. Thank god. Nurse! Nurse, she's awake! Thank God. Thank God. Oh, I just never want to let you go. I love you, Mom. I love you too, baby. Mom, can I get some candy? Sure. You want Grandma or Daddy to go with you? No, I know where it is. You sure you don't want dad to just, uh, come help you push the buttons? Dad, I got it. Come here, baby. I'll give you some change. We got $5. Machine's right around the corner. I think she'll be fine. Thanks, Grandma. - Hurry back, sweet pea. - Okay, Mom. You're so grown. You sure you weren't speeding? No, Thomas. I don't speed. I usually have the baby, so no. Wow. You don't remember anything else? No. Hey, Brittany. This one guy cutting me off. I swerved and tried to hit the brakes, and they didn't work. Next thing I know, I'm slamming into a concrete barrier. Then nothing. What's taking her so long to get some candy? There you go. You're finally back. See what you got. Where'd you get this? Tracy gave it to me. Tracy. Dad, why did she say she's my stepmom? Baby, I need you to stay with your grandma. Okay. Sorry. Just the man we're looking for. - What's this about? - You need to come with me. Get your hands off of me. You don't remember us from the university? Because we remember you. What's this about? - You need to-- - Get your hands off of me. I got a ex-wife who just got out of a coma a couple hours ago. I'm not going anywhere. Fine. You want to explain to her why we got an anonymous tip stating that a certain professor who's currently under a murder investigation, might have also cut his ex-wife's brake lines? What? You're coming with us. Tracy Jacobs, all right? I keep saying-- Tracy Jacobs. Maybe you're not spelling it right. We ran her name and all the other information you gave us, and nothing came up. What about her apartment? We sent a unit to the address, but the landlord told our officers that nobody lives there by that name. That's impossible. Look, I-- I've been there. I slept there. And you're saying this fantasy woman of yours is your ticked off girlfriend? Was. Was your girlfriend. Student. Look, look. You asked me who I thought it might be. All right? And I'm-- I'm telling you. I mean, no person comes up to a child and says, I'm gonna be your stepmom. - Are you serious? - That's right. You felt threatened because she gave your daughter a bracelet. That's right. Look. I-- I know how crazy it sounds. Sounds like a load of crap. You ask me, you're the one with everything to lose. Ex-wife, ex-girlfriend, cushy teaching job. Fine. Y'all don't want to listen to me? All right, I'm telling you, there's something off about this woman. If my ex-wife's brake lines were cut, then that's who you should be looking at. What is this? What is it? What is this? It's okay. Megan, I would never do that. So this woman has been around our daughter. No. I never bought her around Brittany. She must have followed me to a visit or something. Do you love her? Just because I slept with her doesn't mean I love her. I love you. Then get me out of here. - Okay, I want to go home. - I know, baby. I know. - Get me out of here, now. - I know, honey. - No, get me out of here. - I'll be right back. Please, just wait a second, all right? All right. - Diane. - Yeah? Can you pick up Brittany from school and keep her with you tonight? Absolutely. All right. I'll leave now. All right, baby. I love you. Love you too, Mom. Bye. - Call you later. - 'Kay. Do you think Mom's gonna be okay? Mm-hm. I do believe she's gonna be okay, honey. And you're gonna come to my place and we're gonna have some s'mores, and hot chocolate, and stay up late, and carry on. Hey, Brittany. Oh, can I go play with him, please? Sure, babe. Want me to hold that? - Yeah. - Okay. - Come on. - Have fun. You're it! Brittany? Brittany? Brittany? Brittany? Did you see Brittany, honey? Did you see the little girl? You were just playing with her. She was here. But-- I-- she's not here anymore. She's not here? Brittany. Brittany? Brittany. Brittany. - Brittany? - Oh, my God. Where did she go? Brittany? Is this 9-1-1? Yeah. My granddaughter's missing. I was on the playground the whole time. Ms. Shibley, what happened here? As I said before, she was playing with these little kids, those little kids, and I turned around for two seconds to use my phone. And I turned back and she was gone. She was just gone. I don't-- I don't understand. Do you know any of these kids that she's playing with? No, but they seem to know her. Did you call her parents? I did. They're coming home from the hospital. Thank you for your time. If we need any more information, we'll give you a call. - Okay. - Thank you. And you have no idea of where our daughter is? We're doing the best we can, sir. The best you can? The best you can? Let me tell you what the best you can would have been. You out there looking for that woman instead of sitting down questioning me. - Thomas. - No, no, no. This is BS. Find my daughter! - I apologize. - No. Your family is going through a very tough time. We understand. Brittany. Brittany! Brittany. Brittany, where are you? Brittany. Brittany. Brittany! Brittany, where are you? Oh, baby. Baby. It's okay. It's okay. All right. All right, come here. Come here. Come on, come on. I got you. I got you. All right, all right. Are you hurt? Are you hurt, baby? Huh? Okay, okay. Okay, all right. Okay. All right. Daddy's here. She's okay, baby. Yeah, she's just a bit shaken up. Oh, thank God. Thank God you found her. I'm bringing her home now. Listen, I'm sorry about this. Hurry, please. I'll see you soon. Hurry. Hi, young lady. - I'm detective Daly. - Oh, come on. Come on. Oh, whoa, whoa. Mr. Lewis, it would be best if we could take Brittany to the station tonight and get her statement. Now, I realize this is a traumatic experience for her, - but-- - I had enough of you guys. The only place I'm taking my daughter is to be home with her mother. And if she's feeling up to it tomorrow, then I'll bring her by the police station. She can give you a statement then. Understood. Thank you. All right, baby. We're going home. All right? All right. You think I wanted to be this person? You think I wanted to be like this? Again? Do you? Answer me! How's it going? Brittany. Brittany, wait, wait. Don't go in there. Don't go in there. Why? Why? I know women like you. Controlling, manipulative, just like my mom. We fixed her, too. But you're a bit more stubborn, see? You didn't die in the car. But that's okay. I have an emergency. I need you to send the police to my address. I think there's a officer down, all right? Here. You give them your address, all right? Go in the car. Lock the door. Lock the door, sweetie. You're gonna drown. Megan. Your daughter is gonna call me mom. Megan! Megan. Megan. Tracy-- Stop. Don't come any closer. Wait, wait. Wait. Come on. Tracy. Just please, let her go. There's still enough time. The police aren't here. All right? It doesn't have to be like this. Doesn't have to be like this. Just-- just-- just let her go, okay? You don't deserve this. Neither does she. Okay? If you let her go, me and you, we can get out of here. You and me? We can leave together? That's right. Just-- just let her go. Come on. Let's go. You think I'm stupid. You, and me, and Brittany, we can never be happy as long as she's still in the picture. She has to die. No! No, no! Freeze! Get on the ground, now! Put your hands up! So you're saying that there were new findings? Yes, sir. For one, the woman who attacked you two, her name isn't Tracy Jacobs. It's Laura Santiago. She got herself picked up out of Texas for jumping bail. Apparently she's been locked up down there since she was only 12. When we had given them a call to let them know she was arrested, they were more than happy to come down and take her back. She'd only been out for six months when she met you. What did she do to get arrested in the first place? Well, the story that she told you wasn't too far off. Her parents did die in a fire, but it was she and her brother who set it. Her brother? She wasn't an only child. Remember the apartment was under an Alfred Santiago? That's Laura's older brother. It took a lot of red tape to get their juvenile records because they were sealed by the arresting state. Once we got the judge to unseal them, it cleared everything up. Laura and Alfred had both been convicted of killing their parents. But there wasn't enough information to make a murder conviction stick. The state had offered them a plea deal. Plead guilty, and they would only have to go into a mental institution until their 25th birthdays. And after they were arrested, they were both diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder, schizophrenia, and a list of other mental disorders. So she was never in foster care? No. Just state facilities. So where is this brother now? We're still looking for him, ma'am. But don't worry. He won't get far. He has nowhere to go, and no family on the outside. Please, trust us. You have nothing to worry about.
