Apologies are useless if you'll just keep on doing the same thing. You've got to shape up, son. Or do you want the fate of your friend to also happen to you? Huh? Will you show him some respect?

[Sheena] What do you plan to do with your life, huh? Play in a band and do drugs all your life? Is that it? Don't you dare talk down on me about my band. Okay? The real problem here is you don't have long term plans. Your life lacks direction. That's why you're like that. So what do you want to happen? What do you want? Huh?! [Sheena crying softly] [Rustin breathing rapidly] Rustin? [Rustin breathing rapidly] Oh shit. I'll get back to that later. [sniffles] - That's what you... - Mm. This time, I mean it. - But you said the same thing last night. - Oh. Love you. [keys clatter] Oh, okay, okay. [straining] All right. [strains, yelps] Let me help you with that, sir. All right. [Rustin] There you go. This one's cute. Hey… [both] Pinoy! Oh! Goodness, thank you so much! Yes, I need your muscles, fellow countryman. Thank you. Bok, by the way. Mm-hm! [Rustin] Uh, Bok? Call me Bridget if that's easier for you to remember. Bridget's fine. Oh. Let's just stick to Bok, if that's cool. [chuckles] Oh, okay, let's just stick with Bok. Okay. [laughs] Um… Clyde. Clyde? Wow. The name fits this place. It's really handsome. Ugh, the sun's gone again. Come on. You know how it is here, inconsistent weather. - Sometimes it rains suddenly. - [girl] Beauty! Well, that's true. It's crazy. - Let's go inside, come on. - [girl] Beauty? Beauty? - Yes, Yumi? - Oh. I'm already hungry, Beauty. [Bok] Oh. This is Yumi, she's my niece. - Uh… And she calls you that? - [soft guitar music plays] Because she's really confused about what to call me so I told her to call me Beauty. Because it fits me, and it's short and simple, right? - [chuckles] - That's true. [both chuckle] Beauty, you're talking to a stranger. That's not being careful. He's not a stranger. He's a friend. Fellow countryman. He's Uncle Clyde. Hi, Yumi. Say hi. [chuckles] Oh gosh. My niece is acting really shy around you, Clyde. Okay. Let's get inside now. Let's go inside. Come on, Clyde. Let's go eat some snacks. Let's go. Oh. It's fine. I'm all right. Don't be shy. Come on, let's all eat inside. It's just me and Yumi here at the house. Come, let's go. Just get inside. That's heavy. Come on, Clyde. [murmurs nervously] Okay. [Bok] Okay. Thanks again. Oh, put it there. Really? That's ginger tea. They said in the Philippines, they drink this one for them to condition their voice. Is that right? Doesn't that taste really awful? - Look at you. I knew it. - [whimpers] [Bok] Hey, hey, hey. What did I teach you? Hmm? [Bok and Yumi] Endure it for beauty! [Yumi giggles] [spoon clinking] Um… [clears throat] - Yumi? - [Yumi] Hm? Where's your mommy? Is she… joining us? Is she… coming home soon? She won't. She's still at work. But my real Mommy and Daddy over there are both in heaven now. They're now my angels, you know? [Rustin] Oh. - [spoon clinking] - [Rustin sighs] [Bok] Car accident. Exactly three years ago. Then Rachelle acted as her stepmom when Yumi's biological mom passed away. But she's out of town right now. She has a convention in New York. Oh. Okay, nice. I know what you're thinking now. [chuckles] She looks really Filipino. That is not her real father. Yumi… can you get my phone, please? I just need to check something. Say the magic word. Please? Okay! Well, Yumi's biological dad is Filipino. An addict. Asshole. - Really good-for-nothing. - [emotional music plays] Actually, after the divorce happened, he never even showed up. He just disappeared. He left her with their daughter. It's a good thing Sheena never got back with him. And it's also a good thing because she found the right man for her. But sadly… they both died all of a sudden. Sometimes life's very tragic. Oh. I'm sorry, I… Are you getting bored, huh? Huh? Am I over sharing already? - I'm sorry. - Oh no, no, not at all. [Bok] Mm, okay. But is Yumi asking about her real father? There seems to be no point in introducing her to him. [approaching footsteps] - Here's your phone, Beauty. - Thank you. [Bok] More ginger tea? - No more? - [Yumi] No more, please. [Bok] Okay. [emotional music continues] [sighs] [exhales sharply] [sighs] [horn honks] [mic feedback whining] [man] All right! [crowd cheering] [rock band playing] [crowd cheering] [man] Nice one! Thank you very much. If someone wants to join us for a little jam or something, come on stage. You're welcome.

[ringing] [ringing continues] [bed creaking] [sighs deeply] [sighs] [Rustin grunts] [exhales] [sighs] Yeah, I just need you to… to babysit for four hours. Yeah. You know Yumi. She's not a difficult kid. Okay. Okay, fine. Um, can you recommend someone? Someone that… Someone that I know? Someone that you know that I can trust? Okay. All right, please call me. All right. Thank you. Oh, so did you miss me, Handsome? Already? - Bok. - Oh? I brought… some chocolates. I thought of Yumi. - Oh! - Thought she might like these. That's so sweet. I'm jealous. Well, just give it to Yumi yourself, okay? - Let's go inside. Come on. - Uh… Bok, I just overheard that you need a babysitter for Yumi. - Yeah. - You know, I can do it. But let me… Let me think. Well, I just met you yesterday. Oh come on. You can trust me. I'm a general's son. And so what? It's actually worse that you're the general's son, right? Because if you do bad things to my niece, for sure you'll just get away with it easily. Come on. I'm harmless, Bok. Hold on. [scoffs] Tell me straight. Why do you want to take care of Yumi anyway? Why do you want to babysit? Do… you know anything about kids? And yes, this is a Q&A portion. Uh, well, I have nieces and… Bok, I really need a side hustle. It'll only take a few hours, right? - [sighs] - [cell phone chimes] Come on. Okay, okay. They messaged me. Okay, okay. - All right. Yes! - Let's hurry inside. Yumi, if something goes wrong, what will you do? Call Beauty. Very good. Okay. If you can't get to the phone, what do you do? Run outside the streets and scream, "Help!" That'll do, Yumi. The handsome guy might hear you. Okay. If you can't get out of the house, what will you do? Hide in my secret place. [giggles] - Good job, my smart niece. Okay. - [giggles] All right. Um, handsome? It's settled. Come here. [Bok laughs nervously] [sighs] Okay. I better get going. - Take care of her, huh? - Sure. I'll get going now. I'll be good. Bye now. Ik hou van je. Ik hou van je, my dear niece. Okay. You two, take care. Bunny is carrying six boxes. Three… three. - Repeat it six times. Okay. - [sighs] [Yumi] There are 18 apples in six boxes. Then bunny adds two apples. Twenty divided by six is three, with remainder two. Okay, I got it. The boxes of three apples each. Eighteen… [sighs] [Yumi] It's 18… [wrapper crinkling] Need help? No, thank you, Uncle. [sniffles] Okay. I'm done now. Can we play already? Yeah. Sure. [gentle music playing] [up-tempo drumbeat playing on TV] [Yumi giggles] Like this? - Follow the steps, Uncle! - Okay. Not like that, no. [Rustin sighs] [sniffles] - [grunting] - [lasers zapping on TV] Come on, come on! [grunts] - Stop! Stop! - [grunting] Uncle Clyde, stop! Yumi, it's just a game. Don't kill it! - [up-tempo drumbeat playing on TV] - [Rustin sighs] Yumi, can we do something else? - [grunts] - [Yumi] Don't kill! [screams] Stop killing! [up-tempo drumbeat resumes, stops] Uncle, why did you stop it? [Rustin sighs] [Rustin inhales sharply] [dramatic fanfare plays on TV] [thuds loudly] [cartoon character] Geronimo!

Yumi, you can have them. [soft piano music playing] Um… Yumi, do you want Uncle Clyde to build you a rocket ship? You can do that? [Rustin] Of course. Really? - [Rustin] Mm-hmm. - [giggles] - Perfect! Good job! - [giggles] [cardboard tearing] [gasps] [both laughing] Set it up. [grunts] I'll hold it. We can make it spark. [giggles] There.

Because Uncle Clyde needs to rest already. By the way, Clyde. Thank you very much for spending time with Yumi. Thanks a lot. The pleasure's mine. So do you want me to come back? Hey. Stop making promises. Especially to a child. I might expect something too. When will you go back to our house? Uh… sometime. I'll meet you again. - There, you'll meet again. - [giggles] He hasn't even left yet, but you want him to go back already, Yumi. Okay. Thanks again. Bye-bye! [Rustin chuckles] [Yumi] Goodbye! Bye. [gentle music playing] [chuckles softly] [sighs] [sighs, chuckles] [music fades] Yup, yup, yup. Yeah. I can make it, man. No worries. No worries. All right. I'll see you, man. Bye. Hey… It's just that… Uh, I need… I need another favor from you. Well… I really need to meet a buyer today. Maybe you can… look after her? Uh, listen, I… I have… A gig scheduled today. Oh. Okay. Aww, Uncle Clyde can't go to our house? Uh, he can't, I'm so sorry. Because he has a prior commitment. And then, it really happens. - He tends to forget. - Bok, okay. - Okay, I'll do it. - [Bok] Okay. - Let's go now. - Yay! - [Bok] Yay, let's go. - Yay! [Bok] I knew it. You couldn't resist us. - Here.

Take care, you two. - Clyde, watch after her, okay? - I'll take it from here. - [Bok] Okay, bye. - [sighs] Bye!

It'll be really quick. Okay! - Really? - Mm-hmm. Then come on! Where? Let's go. Oh, okay, let's go. [Yumi humming] Hello. Did you pick anything? Um… yeah. Uh… not yet. Uh… what's your best seller here for, uh… For kids? Here we have this and I'm… I'm sure your daughter will like this. Okay. We'll have both. Thanks. No problem. - Oh, excuse me? - [server] Yes? Um… have you seen Jack? He asked me to meet him here. Yes. He was outside. I saw him smoking. Okay. Okay. [chuckling] Wow! That lady thought that I'm your daughter. - [Yumi giggles] - [chuckles] That's okay. - I'll be right back. - Okay. Don't leave. Do you promise? Wait for the order. I'll be back in a bit. Okay? Okay. I promise. I'll stay right here. - Okay. Good girl. [sniffles] - [Yumi giggles] [Yumi hums] Hey, Jack. Hey, man. Hey, man. Gotta be honest, man. Uh… I don't think I'll be staying here for good, so… Oh, that's fucked up. But, um, hey. Things might change. If I do, I still want the gig, all right? [Jack] Yeah if you're planning to stay for longer. We like the singing, man. [Rustin] Yeah. Um… So, all right, then. Uh… If you're staying for good, just let me know. We really could use someone like you. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, man. All right. - See you. - Bye, man. [electric piano playing] - [gasps] Where's my daughter? - She's there. [patrons chattering] [emotional music swells] [chuckles] [sniffles] [Yumi continues playing piano] Yumi, hey, don't forget our plan. - That's our secret, okay? - All right. We were never gone. Yes, it'll be our secret. Okay. But then… why is it a secret? Well… because we never asked permission from Beauty. But… isn't that called lying? [sighs] Well… Um… [inhales sharply] The truth is, it's really bad to keep secrets from anyone. You always have to tell the truth. And they should always know where you are. And you can never, ever leave the house by yourself. You should always ask permission, okay? So… we shouldn't keep it a secret? Um… Look at it this way. Um… If ever your mommy or Beauty finds out, they will definitely get angry with me and they would never allow your Uncle Clyde to visit you anymore. That's it. Oh. Okay, okay. We can keep this a secret. But… can I share a secret with you too? Sure. My dream is to become a singer. [chuckles] That's awesome. [sighs] And I want to audition for the school program. But Mommy and Beauty told me wait next time to give it a go. [Rustin] But why? They first want me to take voice lessons. But then… Uncle? Can I go to the auditions without voice lessons at all? Yes, you can. It's possible. Why not? Okay, fine. Can you sing now? [sings off-key] ♪ Let it go, let it go ♪ ♪ Can't hold it back anymore ♪ - ♪ Let it go... ♪ - Wait, Yumi, hold on, wait a minute. About what Beauty and your mom told you… Uh… don't you really want to take voice lessons for a while? I want to do it, Uncle, but I have to wait one month till Mommy enrolls me. [sighs] But the auditions will happen soon. Hmm… So… do you really want to go to that audition? Mm-hmm. But I'm not sure if I'll pass that one. You know what… That's how life is. Like that. There are no guarantees. Win or lose, whatever other people may tell you, you should still try and fight. Okay? You always have to try and give it your best. Okay, daughter? Mm-hmm! But why are you calling me "daughter"? - Huh? Uh… - [Yumi laughs] Remember? That's what the waitress said earlier. That you're my daughter. [laughing] [Rustin] Anyway, going back to your dream. I will drop you off at the auditions. Promise? Promise. Uh… What's that? It's the promise handshake of Timmy and Papa Bear. Wait, who? [sighs] The bestest friends! You don't watch that? You lick your hand and do the handshake to seal the pact. Can't we do a… fist bump instead? Come on, Uncle. Please do it. Okay. [Yumi] Come on. Take your gloves off! Take your gloves off! Take your gloves off! [upbeat music playing] Mmm. Yay! [laughs] Smile. Stretch. - Stretch. I'm serious. - [giggles] Stretch and then go… Then curve. [vocalizing] [both] Ah… - [laughing] - Ah… Open. Ah… [laughs] [high-pitched trilling] [blubbers] [high-pitched trilling] [laughs] - [note sounds] - Ahh! Not from there. Don't use… Don't use your tonsils. You'll have tonsillitis. - [note plays] - [vocalizes] - That sounded like a horror film. - [giggles] - [Rustin] Is the water still cold? - [panting] It's not, Uncle. Hold on. [panting] It's hard to sing here in the water. That's part of it. Did you know that that's how the Songbird was trained? Resilience. Uncle, who's Songbird, huh? [Rustin] Never mind. Now, let's try it.

[laughs] - [Yumi whimpers] [snoring loudly] [Bok] Yumi, you better tell him yourself. It's embarrassing. Because he might think I have a crush on him. [buzzer sounding] [knocking] [buzzer sounding] [knocking] Hey! [Bok] Hey! - Uncle Clyde! - Hi. - Hang on. The door. Wait for me. - [Bok and Yumi] Okay! I'm really sorry. This is all Yumi's fault. She wants to go out, and she wants to take you too. No problem. [gasps] A dollhouse! Wow. How did that become a dollhouse? [soft music playing] [Bok] Hmm… Oh! - [Yumi] There! - See that? She's right. Did you make this, Uncle? Yeah. I did. But that's… that's unfinished. To be fair to you, you know, you've got a ten, Clyde. What's that? What's ten? You have a tendency. - Oh, hell no. - [chuckles] - [Bok murmurs] - [Yumi] I like it! Is it okay if I keep it? [Bok] Hey, would you stop it, Yumi? Sure. It's yours. Only when I finish it, hmm? All right, then. But, uh, for now, you can have this. Installment. [gasps, giggles] Thanks a lot, Uncle! - Anyway… let's go? - You're welcome. Uh, okay, I'll… I'll get changed. [Bok] Okay. Sure, we'll wait for you. [birds singing] [Yumi] Yay! Uncle! Come on, let's go! Let's play, Beauty! We will win! - [Bok whooping] - We will win! [Yumi giggles] - [Yumi giggles] - [Rustin chuckles] [giggles] Stop, stop, stop! [giggling] [both laughing] [squealing and giggling] Yeah! More! More, huh? [laughs] You might end up flying in the sky. [Yumi giggles] You still hungry? You want some? [with mouth full] Sure. Thanks, baby cakes. [chuckles] Aww. You're both so sweet. If I didn't know any better, I would've thought that you were her dad. [sniffles] Oh! So cute! [laughs] Look at that. [all laughing] [Bok] No! You're crazy! - I'll catch you. - [Yumi giggles] - Kick. - [laughing] Kick. - [growls] - [laughs] Your turn. [Yumi giggles] [Bok] You're like dad and daughter. - Wee! - You know what, Yumi? - What? - You are my human earmuffs. [both laughing] - Uncle Clyde, Uncle Clyde. - What? I have something to tell you. What is it? [softly] You're my new best friend. [giggles] [gasps] Let's go. - Over there. To the swans. - [gasps] Yay! - Let's go over there! Woo-hoo! - Yeah! [cheering] [soft music continues] [music fades out] [inhales sharply] [gentle piano music playing] [gentle music swells] [chuckling softly] [Bok] You'd say I did excellent this time. Well, she's very tired, and she's asleep now. See? She's already sleeping soundly. We're so thankful that Handsome is here. He carried Yumi to her bed. Wait. Say hi to Rachelle. Oh my God! It's really you! What on earth do you think you're doing? [emotional music playing] Why? Do you know each other? Bok! That guy's Rustin! - God, Bok! - Um… Bok, uh… The thing is… [sighs] W-Wait. - Um… Bok... - No, hold on, no. [softly] Fuck. You son of a bitch. You've been fooling all of us? You made us look stupid. It's not like that at all. And what do you mean? What the fuck. You didn't even bother telling us your real name. What's your plan, anyway? I just wanted to get to know my daughter. [Bok] Get to know her? When she's already doing fine now? Look, I don't know you at all, but I know everything that you've done. I know. Bok, I'm aware that I lacked some... [Bok] Yes, you're right. A lot. Where were you when Sheena was pregnant with Yumi? Where were you when she was born? And where were you when Sheena died? Where? Those were the times that you should've been beside Yumi. Where were you? Were you getting high? Back in the Philippines? You were stuck there and couldn't go? Huh? Really, damn you. That's exactly my point, Bok. That's why I'm trying to make up for it. I was so stupid to let Yumi spend time with you. Damn. How could I be so dumb? I trusted you! Why do you even want to get close to Yumi, huh? Why did you want to spend time with Yumi? She's doing really well now! [Yumi] Beauty? Uncle? Are you fighting now? - No, no. Of course, we're not. - No. We're just talking. Go back to your room now. Uncle Clyde will be leaving soon. Aww… Thank you for today, Uncle. Have a good night. [sighs] Okay. Good night. [Bok] Go back to your room. Okay. Bye-bye. Good night. Do us a favor. Don't mess with our lives. [cell phone ringing] [cans rattling] [ringing stops] [sighs] What is it, Dad? Rustin, I just wanted to check on you. Well… [sighs] I just met my daughter. Everything was going great until I was, uh… I got caught, so… [murmurs, chuckles] I'm not allowed to see her anymore. [soft music playing] I know, Dad. I know what you're going to say. [grunts] That I'm a bad son, that I'm a bad father, and I'm a horrible husband. Right? That's how you see me. Go ahead! Tell me, Dad. That's how I am, right? Son. I'm proud of you. I'm so proud of you. [sobs] Rustin. Come home. What's the point, Dad? To make life harder for you? Huh? Because… I make trouble. I always make trouble wherever I am. That's just who I am, you know? A failure. Am I right? [chuckles] So… why should I? Of course I want you here. You're my son. Listen. Before your mom left us both, I made a promise that I won't give up on you, son. And I intend to keep that promise. Son, it's just the two of us now. Come home. [sobs softly] [Rustin sobbing] [sniffling] [breathing shakily] [Yumi] Beauty, can you play with me? Oh, I'm sorry, Yumi. I have a student in ten minutes. Well, can you ask Uncle Clyde to come? No. Well, can we go to his house? No. Why can't we go? [Bok] Because he's busy. Well, can we ask him to come when he's no longer busy? Can I call him? No. No, Yumi. You can't call him. You can't see him anymore. Why do you keep saying no? The thing is… [scoffs] You just can't. [emotional piano music playing] [Yumi] Uncle Clyde! [rapping on window] Uncle Clyde! [straining] [grunts] [straining] [grunts] [sighs] Oh! [buzzer sounding repeatedly] - [buzzer continues] - [inhales sharply] [buzzer continues] [bottles clinking] [buzzer continues] Hey. What are you doing here? [inhales sharply] [shivers] Come here. Come on. - How did you get here? - [Yumi] I snuck out of our house. [Yumi sighs] Now, tell me. Why did you sneak out, Yumi? Beauty says you can't go to our house anymore. I can't talk to you anymore. What's the reason? Yumi, dear, it's because, um… Uncle Clyde has done a lot of bad things. But… do you feel sorry? [Rustin] Of course. Then just say you're sorry, right? [sighs] It's not that simple, Yumi. Why not? Isn't it that when someone says sorry, you have to forgive them. [sighs] You know what, Yumi? Someday… You'll be hearing a lot of nasty and bad things about me. But I hope that you'll always remember our happy days. Okay? Of course I'll remember those. But, Uncle… You just have to make up with them, okay? So that we can go to the auditions tomorrow. The auditions are tomorrow? - Wow, that's great. [chuckles] - Mm-hmm. Just go and say sorry now. [buzzer sounding] - [Bok] Rustin? Is Yumi there? - [gasps] Oh no! It's Beauty! [gasps] What do we do? [buzzer sounding] What if they don't allow us to see each other again? You haven't said sorry yet. [buzzer continues] Uh… listen now. Let's play a game. Let's play hide-and-seek with your uncle. - Okay? - Okay, okay, okay. [upbeat guitar music playing] - [buzzer sounding] - [Yumi] Oh no! Rustin! [Yumi laughs] Let's go, Uncle Clyde! - [Yumi laughs] - [Bok] Yumi! Yumi! [Yumi laughs] - [Rustin grunts] - Oh! Yumi! Go! Go! [Bok panting] - [Rustin] Yeah! - [Yumi laughs] - Beauty can't find us. Come on. - Wait, wait, wait, wait! [Rustin] Okay, okay! [gasps] Yay! Whoo! [giggles] [Yumi] I'm flying! [Bok] Yumi! Whoo! There we go! Bye, Beauty! [panting] [whimpering] [giggles] [screaming] [people chattering] [Yumi giggles] [cell phone ringing] - Hello, Bok. - [Bok] Rustin, where are you taking Yumi? Bok, I just promised the child something. - Just let me do this, huh? - Wait! Just this once. - Bye. - Wait, Rustin... Where are we going, Uncle Clyde? Are we going to play right now? - [squeals] Yeah! - Yeah. [off-key vocalizing] No, Yumi. Not like that. Remember I told you before? It should be coming from your diaphragm. Going up. [vocalizing] Like that. Again. [off-key vocalizing] [Rustin sighs] [whimpers] [sighs] [Rustin] Yumi. What's wrong? [Yumi] Uncle Clyde, I'm tired already. [exhales] [groans] Okay, okay, okay. [inhales sharply] [Yumi sighs] Yumi. [sighs] Have you decided what you're going to sing at your auditions? Um… I'm still deciding, Uncle. Okay. - Wow. - But, Uncle Clyde. Can we please play right now? [drawn out] Pleeeease! - Okay. - Please? - Yay! - On one condition. - What? - One last, okay? [vocalizing] [off-key vocalizing] Okay, never mind. Let's play. [Yumi] Yay! [gentle music playing] - [Yumi squeals] - [Rustin yells] Yeah! - [Yumi laughs] - Whoo! Woo-hoo! - Woo-hoo! Yeah! - [Yumi squeals and laughs] - Come on, best friend! - [Yumi yells] [Rustin] Come on. You can try mine. - [Yumi] Mmm! - You like it? [Rustin] Mm. Oh! [Rustin] Whoosh! [Yumi giggles] Grab the leaves! I got one. [gentle music continues] [inaudible] [Rustin] Yumi, I have to tell you something. Tomorrow, after the auditions, that might be the last day that I'll see you. [Yumi] Um… Why is that, Uncle? [Rustin] Remember. No matter what happens, promise me that you'll never forget me, okay? But I don't want tomorrow to be our last day. [ducks quacking] [inaudible] Uh, juice? [Yumi] Mm! Okay. Good. Um… Yumi. - Keep on eating. - Mm-hmm! Uncle Clyde has to make a phone call. [Yumi] Okay. [line ringing] - Bok? - [Rachelle] Where's Yumi, Rustin? Let me talk to her. [Rustin] Uh… Yumi? - Have some. - I'm good. Um… But somebody wants to talk to you first. - Okay. - Okay. Hello? [Rachelle] Yumi, baby! Mommy, are you home right now? Yes. Where are you? [Yumi] In a hotel. What's the name of the hotel? Um… I can't tell you that, Mommy. Yumi, you're not supposed to keep secrets from me. It's a secret for one night only. Please? Please let me stay with Uncle Clyde. Please? [Rachelle] Yumi, please tell me where you are. Uh, Uncle Clyde, Mommy's asking where we are. Please don't tell her. I don't want to go home yet. Please? [whispers] Okay, I promise. I'll bring her back after the audition. What audition? The audition. At her school. She told you about this. But then you told her not to go for it. And you know why. God, Rustin, did you even bother to think about it? Why would you take her there?! I'm sure you already heard her sing. You know that she'll just get rejected. You're just setting her up for heartbreak. [call end beep] [inhales sharply] [sniffles] Mm-hmm? Did Mommy say yes? Yeah. [Yumi] Yay! [giggles] Thank you. You're welcome. [sighs] Do you know how to juggle? - Do you want to see me juggle? - Mm-hmm! - Oop! - [Yumi laughs] Like a clown! Uncle Clyde is a clown. [giggling] - Mmm. - [Yumi] Apple! [laughs] It's so sour. [chuckles] - Oop! Try it. - [Yumi laughs] [Yumi] Uncle Clyde! - Surprise! - [gasps] Wow! - You like it? - Yes, it's beautiful. You're the best uncle ever. The best best friend ever! - [Yumi] Mm! [giggles] - All right. Settle down. - Go to sleep now. Stop moving around. - [Yumi laughs] Rest now. Do your best at your auditions, okay? Yes, sure. Thank you, Uncle Clyde. I love you. I love you too. [Yumi] Good night. [laughs softly] [sniffling] [beer can crinkles] [Rustin] Yumi… I'm your real dad. Yumi. Can you hug Daddy? I am… [sniffles] …Rustin Clyde Villanueva. I haven't seen you for a long time. It's been eight years. [sniffles] I wanted to hug you so badly. I wanted to tell you that I love you so much. [sobbing] If it was possible. You know? Uncle Clyde, who are you talking to? Why are you awake? [giggles] You know what? I'm going to tickle you. If you don't start sleeping… I'll spank you if you don't go to sleep now! [Yumi giggles] [Rustin] Don't ever be like me. Damn it. [birds singing] [audience applauding] [funky music playing] [applauding] [Rachelle] Why aren't they here yet? [Bok whispers] Just relax, Rachelle. I'm sure they're coming, okay? Be patient. What if that asshole doesn't bring Yumi back? [scoffs] I should've called the police. Rachelle, we heard Yumi's voice loud and clear last night, right? She was talking to us about her day. And she's doing okay. [sighs] Besides… I'm sorry, but I really believe that she'll be here in a while. Together with… Handsome. The problem with you is that you trust so easily. If something bad happens to her… Sorry. I apologize. I'm vulnerable. But, Rachelle, as the lone witness, I was the one who saw them when they were together. And I'm sure Handsome would never harm Yumi. They'll be here anytime now. [snoring] [grumbling] [grumbling] Stop it! - Uncle Clyde, please wake up now! - [Rustin] Stop it, will you? It's audition day! - [gasps] Audition day? - [Yumi] Yes! - Okay, let's go! - Here! Get my stuff. Help me. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry! - What should I bring? - My gloves, my gloves! Go! Oh! Okay. Ow! [Rustin grunts] - Careful! - [beer cans clanging] [upbeat music playing] What?! There are no drivers?! You know, Uncle Clyde, if we just run, we can still make it to the auditions. That's a good idea. But first, put your hood on. You might catch a cold and fail the auditions. - Come on, let's go! - Wait, wait, wait! It's there! Okay, okay. Let's go. - Hurry up! - [Yumi giggles] [Rachelle] How come they're not here yet? They're going to be late. [judges chattering approvingly] [Yumi] Let's go! Let's go! Faster! Uncle Clyde, let's go! [suspenseful music playing] Uncle Clyde, faster! [upbeat techno music plays] [woman laughing] Yes, yes! [Yumi] Let's go! [Rustin panting] Just a second! Where are we headed? - [Yumi] There, there, there! - What? - Let's go there! Over there! - Okay. Let's go! We're going to be late! [Rustin groans] Okay. Where's the school? There! Hurry! - [softly] Yay! Very good! - What's taking them so long? Just clap your hands because they'll be arriving. - Just make sure they do, or else… - They'll be here soon. Yeah. Good job. - I'm tired now. - Huh? - I'm tired of running. - You're tired? I'll carry you. - Let's do this! - [squealing] We're going to make it, okay? - [Yumi laughs, squeals] - [Rustin pants] Okay. Uncle Clyde, it's there! The door is there! Is that it? Okay, okay, okay. Faster. Where should we go? - Wait. Where to? - [Yumi] There, there, there! - Where? Okay! - There. Come on! [Rustin] Okay. You told me that they were coming. [scoffs] Where are they? - [both panting] - [Yumi] We'll make it, we'll make it! Wait, teacher, wait! [music fades] [both gasping] Yumi's here. [Bok gasps] - Mommy, you're here! - Yumi!

Wake up for me. [sobbing] Please! Wake up for me. [sobbing] [Yumi crying] Wake up! You don't want to play? [birds singing] Oh, isn't that your favorite, Yumi? You want oranges, baby? [Yumi] Yes, please. Oh, um… We'll just buy them later. You have to go. - What about the oranges? - No, you go ahead. Come on, Yumi. - Rache. - Stay right there. Rache. Rache, uh, will you please allow me to visit Yumi again? [scoffs] No. You can't keep showing up, Rustin. You're going to confuse her. What would happen to her when you're gone? You know, Rache… - I already have a job. - [Rachelle scoffs] I can stay. And then what? You'll start being a father to her? How are we going to explain that to her? Rache… If I leave, it's wrong. If I stay, it's still wrong. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know where I should… [sniffles] …where I should put myself now. It would be best if you go. [emotional music playing] Rache… [music fades] Hi, Sheena. You know… [soft music playing] I have a new best friend. [chuckling] She's so pretty. I missed out. I wasted everything. Well, she takes after you. She's so beautiful. She's talented with instruments and that's what she got from me. [laughs, sniffles] [sighs] [sniffles, sighs] [thunder rumbling] [sobbing] I'm sorry. [weeping] I wish you'd still forgive me, Sheena. [sobs] I wish I had chosen you. [sobs] And I wish I hadn't wasted my time. Well, damn. [sobbing] But you know? The moment I first saw Yumi… I fell in love at first sight. [sobbing] And now… I finally understand… [sobbing] …everything that you've planned for you and me, but I've been such a fool. [sobbing] [older Yumi] That was my last memory of him. Shortly after that, we moved to another house. You're my new best friend. [giggles] - Come on. Let's go over there! - Yeah! [both whooping] - Say… - [both] Stars! [Yumi yells] [older Yumi] Mommy told me he got well and went back to the Philippines. Whoo! [laughing] I'm flying! [Rustin] No matter what happens, promise me that you'll never forget me, okay? [quacking] [older Yumi] It wasn't until a few years ago that they told me the truth. Uncle Clyde is my biological father and he's a drug addict. After he went back to the Philippines, he went into rehab. He wanted to get help to be better. [sniffling] [older Yumi] But he relapsed when his father, my grandfather I never met, died. - [rock band playing faintly] - [scream-singing] [older Yumi] That's all they really know and remember about him. [feedback whining] But for me, I knew a different man. [music fades] His memory was affected ever since he had a stroke. Hey… [sighs] You're gossiping about me, huh? [chuckles] Sir, come on. All right. I'll leave you two alone. Thank you. Uh… It's me. Yumi. Yumi. [exclaims] [emotional music playing] This photo… You even visited me in Rotterdam then. Remember? You used to make me rocket ships. And then… Um… And you made me sing inside a drum that's full of water. You remember now? And I now know the name of that Songbird you were talking about. Don't you remember me at all? I'm sorry, child. I think you might be mistaken. Huh? [Rustin murmurs] [approaching footsteps] Ma'am, I'm sorry, but sir needs to eat now. Can I stay? [caregiver] Of course, ma'am. Um, can I be the one to feed him right now? [caregiver] Sure, that's okay. Thanks a lot. [Yumi chuckles] I'll help you. [Yumi chuckles] - [Rustin mumbles] - [Yumi laughs] [Rustin] Aren't you… going home yet? Huh? Oh, I'll be leaving in a while. Um… Is it okay for me to visit you again? [Rustin murmurs] Okay. Nobody… visits me here. Uh-huh. Okay. All right, then. [Rustin murmurs] [Rustin murmurs] Thanks a lot, huh? Good night now. [Rustin murmurs] [Rustin grunts, murmurs] [gentle music playing] [Rustin murmurs] [Rustin murmurs] [Rustin] I made all of that. [Yumi gasps softly] Those are for my best friend. [murmurs] [laughs softly] Who's this best friend of yours? It's… Never mind. [chuckles] She sings off-key. [chuckles] [laughs] [gasps softly] [laughs] [laughs softly] [laughs softly] [emotional music swells] [emotional song playing] [female vocalist singing in Tagalog]
