- This is the city, Los Angeles, California, 465 square miles of constantly interfacing humanity, representing every race, color, creed, and persuasion, that God. No matter how he is worshiped, chose in his infinite wisdom to deposit here, in the cultural nexus of the Pacific Rim, almost four million people work and play here, and like any other place, anywhere, there are those who have it, and those who want it. Those who have it, enjoy it, no matter how they got it. Those who want it, can get it by attempting to better themselves in a sympathetic community populated by decent citizens cheering them on. or they can try to take it the easy way, because even in the City of Angels, from time to time, some halos slip. That's where I come in, doing my job to the best of my ability on a daily basis. I work here. I carry a badge. (dramatic music) (drum beats) (dramatic music) [Computer Voice] Dragnet.

The names have been changed to protect the innocent. For example, George Baker is now called Sylvia Wiss. (suspenseful music) (quiet talking) Hey, who called the fire department? What the hell is goin' on here? Hey, Chief, where's the fire? (boom) See the fire? I see the fire, I see the fire. Good, when you wake up, tell Jerry Caesar he's outta business. (thud) It was Wednesday, January 7th. A cool day in Los Angeles with 15 mile an hour westerly winds and light scattered clouds at 3,000 feet. I was working day watch out of Robbery Homicide at the same desk my late Uncle Joe occupied when he served with the department 20 years ago. Many aspects of the peace officer's routine have changed since my Uncle Joe's time. Now there are new methods, new philosophies, new equipment. The standard service revolver and simple lead sap have given way to taser guns and anodized metal batons. But there's one thing that never changes, the face of crime. It just gets bigger and badder and uglier every day. My partner's name is Frank Smith. The boss is Captain Gannon. My name's Friday. Joe. Captain. Frank's late, must've been held up in traffic. Frank won't be coming in today, Joe. 24-hour virus? Or tomorrow. - 48? - Frank quit. Bought a goat farm, moved to Ukiah, left you this note. He was too broken up to talk about it. Said he knew you'd understand. Every man has a dream to chase. Frank's was that goat farm. Sure, Captain, I understand. But tell me something. Yeah? Those 3.6 million citizens out there, the ones who expected him to be on the job this morning, will they understand? 8:47 a.m., Captain Gannon had assigned me to investigate the so-called P.A.G.A.N. robberies, a pattern of serial crimes, which had occurred throughout the city. They'd seemed merely irritating at first, but were quickly gaining notoriety through their growing frequency and naked brazenness. I was to contact my new partner at the Central Receiving Lot. A less experienced peace officer might have been concerned he was getting pot luck, but I knew that any detective the department had to offer me was automatically worthy of my respect. (thunk) Say, Sergeant Friday? Who wants to know? I'm Pep Streebeck. I'm your new partner. - Not lookin' like that you aren't, mister. Oh really, what's that s'posed to mean? - It means I don't care what undercover rock you crawled out from, there's a dress code for detectives in Robbery Homicide, section three dash 605.10.20.22.24.26.50.70.80. It specifies clean shirt, short hair, tie, pressed trousers, sports jacket or suit, and leather shoes, preferably with a high shine on them. 9:05 a.m., Streebeck's unauthorized outfit and facial growth were history, and for the first time in 12 years, I rolled into traffic with a new partner at my side. Detective Pep Streebeck, male, Caucasian, six feet, 165 pounds, no distinguishing scars. He had an extensive list of merit citations, which was tainted by his total disregard for departmental procedure. He pictured himself as some hipster, free-bird cop, but his wings were about to be clipped, because now he was going to play the detective game by my rules. (honking) - You know, Friday, we're allowed to go 55. on some occasions, even faster. - I'm well aware of the federally mandated speed limit, Streebeck, but did it ever occur to you that by going eight miles an hour slower, we might save some gasoline and ease the burden on the poor taxpayers out there who pay our salaries? - Friday, a little extra gas isn't gonna put the city in hock, besides this looks bad. Come on, live a little. It's the vertical pedal on the right there. - 9:47 a.m., we arrived at the Griffith Park Zoo, Los Angeles' primary habitat for wild animals, now sustained in dignified natural captivity. An adult male lion and a security guard had been tranquilized with a dart gun, and subsequent robberies had occurred. You know, Streebeck, these animals have it pretty good; simulated surroundings, three squares a day. I'll bet if these creatures could talk, they'd give the citizens of this city a big vote of thanks. - Friday, these animals were trapped and stunned and roped and crated and shipped, dropped into cages. You think they were out in the wild forming lines jockeying for positions saying, take me, take me. I wanna live on damn cement. - Well, let's just say when I look in their eyes, mister, I get a different message, and we'll leave it at that. Are you gentlemen the police? Ma'am, Friday, Streebeck, robbery. You have some P.A.G.A.N. cards for us, do you? Yeah. Three of them, left in separate cages. Let me show you where I found them. This is Ben, our boa constrictor. Now the missing giant anaconda was still here last night at 8:30. I know because that's when it gets its final feeding. Well actually, it's not always its final feeding. Sometimes it hides a little snack for later. Just the facts if you don't mind, ma'am. What exactly does a Central Bolivian anaconda choose to feed on? It eats whole, live groundhogs. - You skip breakfast this morning did you, Friday? Whoever stole it's got to feed it, bub. We also seem to be missing one of these. - Uh huh. Ma'am, what is the approximate dry weight of the average Madagascar fruit tree bat? You mean you don't know? - Now this is the one I understand the least. (growls) - Somebody musta wanted that lion's mane pretty bad to pull a twisted stunt like that. - Although, as mohawks go, it's not that bad. It'll grow back. - Yeah, and how do you tell that to these kids here who've never seen a lion before, and now probably won't have the desire to ever see one again? Kids, it'll grow back. [Kids] Yay! - 10:35 a.m., arsonists posing as Los Angeles city firemen had left a P.A.G.A.N. card in the charred ruins of a downtown warehouse. We were advised to contact the owner of the stolen merchandise, soft core porno lord, Jerry Caesar, at his notorious pleasure compound in the coveted Bel Air section of the city. (honks) Oh, thank God, vibrator repair. - No, ma'am, Los Angeles Police Department, sorry. (jazzy music) It's enough to churn your guts, isn't it, Streebeck? - What, you mean this girl pruning this bush with her... - That a slut peddler like Jerry Caesar can build a modern day Gomorrah smack dab in the middle of the same city where they recorded We Are the World. - Hi. - Hi. Ah, don't get too friendly. Hi, can I help you? Police officers, ma'am, LAPD Robbery. I'm Friday, this is Detective... - April. - That's right. She was a Bait Mate. Bait Magazine, they have one every month, and she was featured... - I get the hang of it, Streebeck, in the April issue. No, Mr. Silly, February. My name is April. Alright, now don't tell me now. Your favorite movies are The Sound of Music and Yes, Giorgio. You love to go bobbing for apples. Your major turn-offs are anchovies, people who don't use coasters, and uh... And men who smoke in public places. Come on, let's go meet Jerry. (seductive music) There's Jerry right over there. - I'm gonna have a place like this someday. Dream on, Streebeck, dream on. Yeah, it's about time. I called you cops three hours ago. Yes, sir, my name's Friday. This is Detective Streebeck. Could you please describe what's missing. - Well, how 'bout the entire run, every single copy, of our 25th anniversary double issue of Bait. - Bait. - Yeah, it's his skin magazine. You say. The intelligent subscriber regards it as a politically-oriented socially-impacted monthly. I'm not gonna allow a gang of cement heads to intimidate me just because I refuse to publish their stupid manifesto. - Would you care to tell us a little bit about that? Well here, read it for yourself. - Manifesto of the International Brotherhood of P.A.G.A.N.s. We believe that bad sex and good drugs are the cornerstones of the great democracy. The peak of pornography... - I think we get the general idea, Streebeck. - My publishing company is not a private platform for any bunch of yahoos that just come along. I don't care how many copies they buy. Just 'cause they got First Amendment rights, that doesn't mean I have to publish their junk. I've got First Amendment rights too. Look 'em up, Friday. I don't have to look 'em up, mister, I can quote 'em to ya. Anyhow, how much do you figure a monthly run of your magazine is worth? - Well, let's just say it's more money than you'll ever see in your life. And I do that every month. At least my money's clean. Well I'll tell you what you do, Friday, before you go home and start polishing your pennies. Why don't you go out there and get my magazines back on the stand where they belong. - Listen, hotshot, I'm gonna tell you something right now. I don't care for you or for the putrid sludge you're troweling out, but until they change the laws to put you sleaze kings outta business, my job's to help you get back your stench-ridden boxes of smut, and since I'm gonna be doing it holding my nose, I'll be doing it with one hand. Excuse me. Jerry, it's time for your collagen treatment. And don't forget, you're having your pores sucked at three. Thank you, Sylvia. Well, boys, as you can see, I got my work to do. Why don't you get the hell outta here and do yours. You have very strong hands. Hey, Sy- wha... Sylvia Wiss, wow. (laughs) Why, yes, that's me. - They oughta transfer you to missing persons, Streebeck, you know everybody. Friday, don't you read the papers? This Saturday's Bait Magazines 25th anniversary party. Caesar is reuniting all of his former Bait Mates. Miss Sylvia Wiss right here, was the very first Bait Mate ever. Fascinating. - Sergeant, if I asked your honest opinion about something, would I get it? You can bet the house on it. - Would you say that these look like the breasts of a 43 year old woman? No, no they don't, Miss Wiss. They're quite impressive. Bordering on spectacular. We have to be running along now. What's your hurry, Sergeant? Wouldn't you like to have an early lunch? - Uh, listen, say, Joe, you know, it's the darndest thing. I seem to have, uh, left my notebook in the car, and it's gonna take me 15, 20 minutes, half an hour or so to find it. Why don't you pump Sylvia here privately for information, and I'll, you know... Nice meeting you, Miss Wiss. I had a good time too. Come on, Streebeck, let's go to the car and find that notebook. Are you crazy? Sylvia Wiss wanted you. - Now let me tell you something, Streebeck. There are two things which clearly differentiates the human species from animals. one, we use cutlery. Two, we're capable of controlling our sexual urges. Now you might be an exception, but don't drag me down into your private hell. - You got a lot of repressed feelings, don't ya, Friday? Must be what keeps your hair up. (powerful music) What is bothering you, besides me? I'm thinkin' about those P.A.G.A.N.s. If all they were after was revenge against Jerry Caesar, I'd chalk it up to slime versus slime. But when they start attacking great institutions like our city zoo, that's when my hackles sit up and turn red. - You gonna lose those red hackles altogether you eat those chili dogs. I can handle it. They're the worst thing for ya. They're filled with nitrites and toxins and poisons, and you're doublin' up on 'em. Let me tell you something, mister. Unlike you, outside of cigarettes, I only have one vice and a good chili dog is it, so please pipe down and let me enjoy my lunch in peace. Okay. You know the kinds of things that can fall into an industrial sausage press, not excluding rodent hairs, bug excrement? I hate you, Streebeck. (engine roars) (tires squeal) With the exception of you and canned cling peaches, I'd be hard pressed to find anyone or anything that doesn't know you should never leave your car keys in the ignition. - It's called a mistake, Friday, but I don't suppose you ever make any of those, do you? Friday, Streebeck, we got another one. Chemical train hijack down at the freight yards. Damn P.A.G.A.N.s must be livin' on NoDoze. Yes sir, Captain, we'll roll as soon as we requisition a new... One more thing. Police and fire departments all over the county have been reporting vehicles stolen, so keep an eye on your car. - 1:15 p.m., after requisitioning a replacement vehicle, we were issued a new Ford Escort sub-compact, and we responded to the call at the Bass Terminal Avenue freight yard, Southern California's largest rail head, with more than a thousand miles of track lying parallel over two million individual ties, hewed from the states majestic redwood forests. 3,000 gallons of a deadly pair of chemicals had been siphoned individually from their respective hijacked tanker cars. We questioned the battered train engineer, Señor Tito Provensal, and then attempted to determine the precise identification of the two missing noxious gasses from the owner of the chemicals company, a Mr. Roy Grest. Actually, trichloronitromethane and the pseudohalogenic compound cyanogen. - pseudohalogenic compounds, cyanogen, uh huh. - Oh, well they shipped in separate containers. When it's mixed properly in the exact ratio, they form a liquid fertilizer. It's clear as water, but you wouldn't wanna smell it. Why's that, Roy? - Basically, it burns the eyes, lungs, and throat, causes vomiting, and if continuously inhaled, death. Oh, sorta like your aftershave. And now it's time to advance with the Reverend Jonathon Whirley, founder of M.A.M.A., the Moral Advanced Movement of America. Today, Dr. Whirley's special guest is Police Commissioner for the city of Los Angeles, Ms. Jane Kirkpatrick. Dr. Whirley. - Thank you, George, and welcome once again to Advance. Commissioner. - Please Dr. Whirley, will you call me Jane. Only if you call me Jonathon. (laughs) Are you seeing this guy? What a mental fur ball. - Just happens to be one of my favorite shows, Streebeck. Why don't you listen and learn. - What a deep honor it is for this city that you have chosen Los Angeles to be the new focal point for the Moral Advance Movement of America. Oh, it's quit simple really, Jane. If one wishes to affect a financial upheaval in this country, one should set his or her sights on Wall Street. If one wishes to revolutionize the political system, he or she would naturally go to Washington. (chuckles) But when dealing with pornography, filth, crime, degradation, what better place is there to begin with than Los Angeles, the current capital of depravity, and what sadly passes for the modern world. - 2:15 p.m., we had been advised to follow up on a theft at 8823467 Magnolia Boulevard. At this time of day, it took us 20 minutes to get there. Complainant was the landlady, Enid Borden. Some P.A.G.A.N. cards had been found. (knocks) What the hell do you want? Police officers, ma'am. 'Bout time you pencil dicks showed up. Why couldn't you have got here before that big, bad, stupid-lookin' piece of sewage breath stole my white weddin' dress? Ms Borden, sewage breath would be your little nickname for? Muzz, Emil Muzz. Not much of an improvement. - That ass wipe also stiffed me for two months rent when his deposit check bounced. God damn puss faced little pimp stick. All that was left in his room was a big box of these things. - Any idea where this Emil Muzz could be right now? Friends, family? Nah, he was a loner. Took off in the middle of the night. Useless scum lappin' shit bag. Just the facts, ma'am. He leave anything else behind? - Yeah, tape deck, which I had to sell to make up for the lost rent, so there's nothin' you can do about it, you slimy little jizz bucket. - Yes ma'am, although I should point out to you that technically you could be cited for swearing at us like that. Says who, flathead? - Says the California penal code section 314.1 covering obscene live conduct in public. Good enough for you, lady? - Them magazines and papers were his down in the trash. No checks or money, I looked. I shoulda thrown it all in the river the day he left, but unlike some people, I have a heart God dammit. That miserable little bag of puke. I think we're finished here, don't you Detective Streebeck? - Hey, didn't she say that she threw some of his stuff in the trash? Uh huh, there it goes, let's roll. - Boy am I glad I got transferred into Robbery and Homicide. You can almost reach out and touch the tension. Hey, what the hell was that? It has its days. Yeah, like today, sitting in a park, getting eaten by ducks, sifting through somebody's garbage. Hello, photograph of some people, kinda faded. Maybe one of them's Muzz. We couldn't be that lucky. Hey, phone number on the back. Think that could mean something? - There's only one way to find out now, isn't there? It's for you. It's the president. It's ringing. - [Woman on Phone] Good afternoon, Caesar residence. Bingo. [Woman on Phone] Hello, may I help you? [Friday] Emil Muzz please. - [Woman on Phone] He's not here right now. - [Friday] This is Detective Sergeant Friday, Los Angeles Police, ma'am. Could you tell us where he is? It's quite important. - [Woman on Phone] Well, since he's Mr. Caesar's driver, and Mr. Caesar's out sailing on his yacht... - That's it, the limousine from the mansion. Yeah, and that's Emil Muzz. Let's check Enid Borden's description. Well, big, bad, stupid lookin'. An exact match. (purposeful music) Police officers, Emil Muzz. (snores) (honks) (grunts) - We need to ask you a few questions, Emil. Blow it out your pants, cop. - Oh good, Muzz, give yourself a hard time. (engine roars) (tires squeal) I'll drive, I'll drive. (fast paced music) (laughs) What are you doing? Calling for backup. - Why? - Because there's specific departmental regulations for high-speed pursuit, mister, and we're gonna follow every last one. Forget it, Friday, this is our collar. [Friday] our collar, huh? [Streebeck] I think so. - Well just let me tell you something, Mr. Lone Wolf, the dedicated men and women of the Los Angeles Police Department comprise one big family, from my brother the traffic cop, to my sister the meter maid, and when one of us makes a collar, we all make a collar. - Friday, are you on any special medication that as your partner I should be made aware of? - Two king 14, two king 14, I am requesting a backup... Oh no. (crash) (tires screech) (crash) Look out! (thud) Look out, Muppets. (crash) (screams) Reckless endangerment of human life, willful disregard of private property, failure to signal for a safe lane change. - Yeah, he's really racking up the violations, isn't he? Not him, you. This is your one-way ticket back to civilian life, Mr. I like to throw the book out the window. That's a good idea. (upbeat music) Hey, Joe, you ever been to Hawaii? (screams) (crash) Look out! (thuds) Surf's up, beach boy, but not for you. You'll be hangin' ten downtown. Read him his rights. Emil Muzz, guess what? You are under arrest. Sit down unless you're growing. - Look, Muzz, we've got you on 87 violations of the motor vehicle code. It's only a matter of time before we tie you into one of those P.A.G.A.N. jobs, not to mention the fact that you stole your landlady's wedding dress, which so far is the only endearing thing about you. So why don't you talk to us? (spits) Listen, you public pawn. My attorney's on his way, and we both know I'll be outta here in 20 minutes on bail. So take off these cuffs and open the door. I wouldn't worry about the door, Muzz. The kind of scum who'd represent you would just ooze right under it. - Look, Joe, why don't you go get a coupla cups of coffee. I know I could use one. You want anything, Muzz? Chewing gum, a snickers bar, and my attorney, badge kisser. Well, Emil. I guess it's just you and me and your balls in this drawer. (bangs) (bangs) (screams) (bang) (scream) (scream) - 4:15 p.m., by the time I'd returned with coffee, Muzz was singing like Beverly Sills. He had been planning to attend a meeting that night at the P.A.G.A.N. clubhouse of which he was a member. But he refused to divulge the time or location of that meeting. Okay, Muzz, let's run through it again. You say you're a P.A.G.A.N., but we found you workin' for Jerry Caesar, that makes you a plant in my book. Why don't you make it easy on yourself and lead us to the stolen magazines. Jump on this and spin, cop. I'm not sayin' another word until my attorney gets here. - Say, Joe, wouldn't a couple of danishes go great with this coffee right now? - [Friday] At 7:13 p.m., Captain Gannon authorized us to stake out Muzz's clubhouse located in the ecologically balanced San Gabriel Mountains. When a code five authorization for undercover surveillance is approved, officers proceed to the central facilities building where the department has an impressive body of research on the precise behavior and dress of today's average street gang member. - You know, Friday, I think we finally found your look. [Friday] 9:56 p.m., we were issued appropriate surveillance apparel and withdrew from central receiving one distressed 1985 unmarked Ford sedan. Yeah, it's right up here. It's just off Highway 61. Yeah, probably some rat hole roadhouse where they sit around watching TV and suck beers all day. (siren) Uh oh, highway patrol. And they're pulling us over. (siren) [Officer] License and registration. What was the offense, officer? - [Second Officer] It's okay, Floyd, they're P.A.G.A.N.s. - Yeah? - Yeah. Show 'em your card, Muzz, Emil. - Yeah, yeah that's right, that's me, Muzz, Emil. Emil Muzz. I been sick. (coughs) Sorry to bother you, fellas. We can't be too careful though, huh? We don't want any non-P.A.G.A.N.s around here, especially tonight, right? Huh? (laughs) (Friday laughs) - Follow us, fellas, the party's just starting. (laughs) Bogus cops. No matter how many times I see that little maneuver, it never ceases to disgust me. - You mean people dressing up in strange clothes, pretending to be who they're not? Exactly, that kind of behavior... Just get out that list of stolen black and whites. (officers laughing) 99974, oh yeah, it's hot alright. Yeah. - Howdy, I'm Emil Muzz, and I'm a P.A.G.A.N.. (laughs) (rock music) Good evening, P.A.G.A.N.s. Don't forget your goat leggings. - Must be every other stolen police vehicle on our hot sheet. We're definitely onto something here. Ya think so? I see school is out. - Yeah, right now all I can think of is 38 little kids standing individually on lonely street corners waiting for a bus that will never come. - Friday, put your goat leggings on and try to blend in. (dog sounds) Put it to sleep, Streebeck. Down boys. (zaps) - You have to admire their techniques in crowd control. Yeah, cozy little group, eh. Just like your local Rotarians. - Hey listen, we get a little wild at times, sure. But nothing like this. (yelling) (loud music) I'd say this is shaping up to be a little more than just a series of simple robberies. People against goodness and normalcy. P- A-G-A-N, P.A.G.A.N.. Nice work, Joe. Ah, here are two who have not yet sipped the nectar of Shaitan. - A small surprise before the ceremony starts. [Streebeck] Why not. - You? - I had a big lunch. (rock music) (horn blares) - I, your high priest, of living P.A.G.A.N. perfection, do call the name Gathool. [Crowd] Do call the name Gathool. Eelbazel, Ignodrohoth, Shaitan. [Crowd] Shaitan, Shaitan, Shaitan. Prepare the virgin. (cheers) Prepare the virgin? I don't like the sound of that. - Let's just hope they're not referring to you. With this bat, I do consecrate. - [Crowd] With this bat, he does consecrate. - The Madagascar fruit tree bat from the zoo. Good eye. With this lion's mane I do consecrate. - [Crowd] With this lion's mane he does consecrate. - Now all that's missing is one humongous 30 foot groundhog gulping reptile. For the final touch to our brew tonight, a pristine virgin in a gown of white. (cheers) Evil bringeth hear our plea. She's as pure as she can be. White and clean as driven snow. From Orange County, here we go. (cheers) - Two to one, that's Enid Borden's wedding dress. - 20 to one, Enid Borden never looked that beautiful on her wedding day. [Crowd] Virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin. (screams) (splash) - Friday! - Let's move. Help! Can you swim? - Red Cross, Junior Lifesaver with clusters, bub. Silly me. (splash) Friday! - Streebeck? I found the snake. Help, help, help. Hang in there, miss, I'm coming. What the hell goes on down there? Who are those two clowns? Who are you? - Friday, Streebeck, Los Angeles police offic... (coughs) Where you from, miss? Anaheim. Her favorite color is blue. Jesus Christ I'm about to be eaten here. (cheers) - Some big guys grabbed me off the street last night. Were you sexually assaulted? No, thank God, they needed a virgin. You're still a virgin? My hat's off to you, ma'am. Hope you stay that way. Streebeck, quick, do something, it's constricting. Distract it. (chokes) Anybody need some boots? - They're heading to the top! Stop them! Go! (dramatic music) (crowd chants) Kill the good, kill the good kill the good, kill the good, kill the good, kill the good, kill the good, kill the good, kill the good, kill the good, kill the good, kill the good. You are all under arrest. [Crowd] Kill the good, kill the good. - Each of you has the right to remain silent. If you waive the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Oh, for cryin' out loud. (gun shots) (scream) (thud) (gun shots) - How come his is so much bigger than yours? Miss? The gun. I've never needed more. (thuds) (screams) (dramatic music) (thuds) (grunts) Come on, Joe. (thuds) (groans) Oh gosh, I'm terribly sorry. Friday, our car, we can steal it back. Right. I'll drive. - Forget it, Streebeck, we're responsible for the safety of a civilian here, and frankly, mister, you just don't belong behind the wheel of a car. Just hang on and keep your head down. (crash) (dramatic music) Good driving, Joe. Yes, you were wonderful. Excuse me, miss. I never did catch your name. Swail, Connie Swail. Your name is Friday? - Joe. - Joe. Joe. (soft music) Pep, Pep Streebeck. Glad to meet you. - You certainly have a beautiful home, Miss Swail. - You bet, can the Beaver come out and play? - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Will I ever see you again, Joe? Absolutely, you're our main witness. We'd like you to come downtown, take a look at the mug books. See if you can make a positive ID on the man you saw. We'll have a police woman come down here tonight, keep an eye on the house, and bring you downtown to Parker Center tomorrow. Here's my card. You'll be needed for further questioning. (soft music) I don't know why, but, somehow I feel like I can tell you anything, Joe. Friday, January 9th, 3:12 a.m. We returned from Anaheim, where we had dropped off the virgin, Connie Swail. I telephoned Captain Gannon at home, waking him. After absorbing several minutes of gratuitous verbal abuse, I requested him to meet us as soon as possible at his office. (knocks) [Captain] Come in. - Evening, Captain. - Captain. - [Friday] 3:35 a.m., we proceeded to relate details of our successful follow-up on the P.A.G.A.N. robberies, and briefed Captain Gannon on the outlandish festival we had attended. Even going so far as to demonstrate the goat dance which we had engaged in as part of our undercover role in the operation. - [Streebeck] This music, pulsating, over and over and over again. Stop it. - [Joe] At this point, Captain Gannon became quite upset, accused us of being on all-night drinking binge, and based on our general appearance, seemed reluctant to contact the Sheriff's Department to investigate the area. - Captain, if you will just call the Sheriff's Department, I have the directions to the compound right here in my pocket. (clatters) Hay fever? Illegal narcotics, sir. Actually, hallucinogenic love drugs. The P.A.G.A.N.s were taking them, we were trying to fit in. Uh huh. If it weren't for the drugs, we couldn't have gotten away from the snake. The snake, I forgot about the snake. How big did you say it was again? - 20 feet long. - 30 feet long. - Actually sir, we'd like to request the opportunity to have you come down to the crime scene and visually verify our report, and if you could call Commissioner Kirkpatrick, we believe this incident, because of its sheer magnitude, is worthy of her personal attention as well. - Friday, do you have any idea what time it is? - Yes, sir. - Oh, don't ask him that, Captain. It's 4:27 a.m., sir. He lives for that, it's in his blood. Thursday, January 8th, 5:45 a.m. Having gained Captain Gannon's grudging agreement to contact the commissioner and proceed with us to the San Gabriel Mountains, we eventually arrived at the scene of the previous night's debauchery. - What is this, Gannon, some sort of juvenile cop humor? And where the hell's this supposed P.A.G.A.N. festival? I can't understand it, sir. There was a huge electronic screen up there with P.A.G.A.N. vision written all over it. - Yeah, yeah, and this was the hole that was filled with water we had to dive in to save the virgin who was being eaten by the giant snake. Captain, who are these painted cretins? Two of my best men, ma'am. That's right, that's right. - They're heading up the P.A.G.A.N. investigation. - They were heading up the P.A.G.A.N. investigation. As of now, you may consider them off it. But Commissioner? Gannon. What am I going to tell the press? That now we are investigating invisible crimes on the word of two trick-or-treaters? - With all due respect, ma'am, you are a civilian and probably unaware the department has regs authorizing us to wear specialized apparel during a assimilation surveillance. - Sergeant, you yourself were once a civilian, I assume. Yes, ma'am. - If you do not drop that insubordinate tone, you'll be one again sooner than you think. Wait a minute, Friday. I've never known you to act this way, Friday. Certainly not the type of behavior that your Uncle Joe would have approved of. You know the kind of man he was. I suggest that you try to be a little more like him from now on. Yeah, sir, I'll try. Good. (pensive music) I'm sorry, Joe. He's not in any of these. And I'll never forget his face. - okay, I guess this officially closes my end of the investigation. As far as your personal safety is concerned, I wouldn't worry. That guy's probably a couple hundred miles from here by now. 10:30 a.m., I went to pick up Detective Streebeck at the sanitationally questionable commune, which passed for his apartment building in the come as you are section of Venice Beach. (knocks) The door was opened by police officer, Betsy Blees, who had apparently dropped by to chat about more effective methods of law enforcement. They'd been playing a version of good cop, bad cop, and though I was unable to fathom the rules, it seemed clear that Streebeck had lost this particular round. At any rate, playtime was over, and it was back to routine duty for me and Pep Streebeck. - Hey, Joe, listen I suddenly got very hungry. Let's say we stop and grab some sushi, huh? - Come on, Streebeck, we're late for our watch already, and raw tuna really isn't my bag. (loud boom) (dramatic music) My hat was in that car. - Yeah, I can tell you who reblocked it for ya. P.A.G.A.N.s, I need some coffee. - I know where they serve the best in town, come on. ♪ No time for chit chat ♪ ♪ Just reply don't waste my time ♪ ♪ When I need answers ♪ ♪ To the questions that arise ♪ ♪ Get to the point ♪ ♪ All I really want to know ♪ ♪ Is just the facts ♪ Ma'am. ♪ Just the facts, just the facts ♪ ♪ That's all I need to know ♪ You know I hate to admit it, Streebeck, but for once in your life, you're right. This is good coffee. Oh, you should try the French toast. Listen, Joe, lend me 20 bucks. - Do I know you long enough to lend you money? I don't think so. - I know we've been ordered off the P.A.G.A.N.s, but that doesn't mean that technically we can't follow up on one of their thefts. The trichlornitromethane and the pseudohalogenic compound cyanogen. - Listen, there's only one illegal lab in the city with the capacity and the personnel and the equipment to mix those two chemicals into a deadly gas. We've been waiting for months on narcotics to bust this place, and we can do it tonight. Forget it, Streebeck, it's strictly out of our jurisdiction now. - But this won't be a P.A.G.A.N. investigation, Joe, we can bring Narc in on it. Joe, police work is a matter of us against them, not mother may I. Hi, Kay, how are you? I could find out where they've set up the lab this week. Oh, how? By you lending me 20 bucks. - 6:30 p.m., after witnessing the gratuitous sex display at Streebeck's favorite coffee house and an outlay of $50 by me to one of his old informants, I proceeded by Celebrity Cab to 3396834108th Street, an illegal drug lab grotesquely disguised as a legitimate place of business. Streebeck had gone to seek assistance from some friends of his in the undercover narcotics unit where he used to work. Funny how it didn't surprise me that he was late, even though he knew I was waiting in a part of town where it's not advisable to just stand around whistling. (whistles) Hey, zipper head. - Up a little late tonight, aren't we kids? Let's have one of your smokes. - It's an unhealthy habit I don't encourage in others, son. Get smart, give it up by not taking it up. - Thanks for the public service announcement. Now hand over your money, and I'll go buy my own smokes. Well, if you're that strapped for cash, I'd suggest a part-time job. How 'bout a paper route? It builds character, it did in my case. - Hey, we're not askin' you for your money, Ozzie. - No? - No. Are you threatening me, son? [All] ooh! (dramatic music) (thud) (groan) (bangs) (thunk) And on a school night too. (powerful music) Hit the deck! (crash) (thump) (crash) (splash) (clanging metal) I can't quite place it. It tastes like... - Milk, just like the sign said on the building before you obliterated it. Fresh, wholesome milk. You probably love this stuff, don't you? - Vitamin D, calcium, essential for good strong bones and healthy teeth. But that's probably all Greek to you, isn't it, Mr. Gingivitis? 7:15 p.m., after explaining to the proprietors of the milk factory that they were helpless to take legal action against the city since we had properly obtained a search warrant, our apology was reluctantly accepted, and Streebeck and I were on our way back to Parker Center. After losing the two previous vehicles we had been issued, the only car the department was willing to release to us at this point, was an unmarked 1987 Yugo, a Yugoslavian import donated to the department as a test vehicle by the government of that country, and reflecting the cutting edge of Serbo-Croatian technology. (whistles) (suspenseful music) Streebeck, I've been thinking. Maybe your informant was right. Maybe the P.A.G.A.N.s anticipated our little raid and mixed those chemicals into a deadly gas before we got there. Nuh-huh. Hey, Friday? That's me. What do you like to do for fun? I mean, I'm your partner now, and I don't even know where you live. That's right, mister, you don't. Streebeck, why are you always looking at your watch? I'm watching my TV. You don't like my music, you don't wanna talk, so I'm watching my TV. - Here at the annual Law and Order Foundation dinner, where Los Angeles mayor, Peter Parvin, is fighting for his very own political survival. Leading that attack again is Police Commissioner Jane Kirkpatrick. Let's hear what she has to say. - This rampaging gang of P.A.G.A.N.s has made a mockery of the city's administration. Vehicles from the fire and police departments are stolen in broad daylight. Deadly toxic chemicals are on the loose. What next, Mr. Mayor? In my opinion, Mayor Peter Parvin should consider the welfare of his own constituents and do the honorable thing. Resign now. - You know, Friday, I think you and the Commissioner would make a cute couple. I like the way you both keep your jaws locked. Plus, the two of you do share that same curious affection for hats. May I remind you that only this morning Commissioner Kirkpatrick threatened to turn me into a civilian? Yeah, I know. There was a gleam in her eye though. Put a clamp on it, Streebeck. - I have never been elected to public office. I have always sought the approval of a somewhat higher power for my actions. The sad truth is that we live here now in a city where even a gross pornographer like Jerry Caesar is not immune from lawlessness. With this grim fact in mind, I am relieved to announce tonight that even Mr. Caesar himself has bravely decided to strike a blow in our common fight against crime. Yes sir, yes indeed. This guy knows God personally. I hear they play racquetball together. - Yeah, well just go ahead and chuckle away, mister. I don't hear God laughing. You will once he sees your haircut. - My friends, in an unprecedented gesture of atonement, Mr. Caesar has agreed to donate the sum of $1 million to my Moral Advance Movement. (applause) - [Friday] 7:52 p.m., after witnessing the raging political turmoil on Streebeck's puny television set, I was really looking forward to the end of a rotten day. Well, wanna go get something to eat? Not tonight, I have plans. - You do? - Uh huh. What? What? Where do you go? What is her name? Does she have a sister? Good night, Streebeck. Truth is, I don't care where you go. Yeah, I do, I gotta know. (horror music) I knew it. It's Nightmare on Elm Street. And that would make him Freddy Krueger. We're gonna be driving along some night and the lighting's gonna be bad, and he's gonna mistake me for some pretty little coed, and out comes that claw. (growls) 170 pounds of ground chuck. Who knows what kind of thrill-seeking hose monster he's got stashed in there. My God, he's dating Mother Goose. Hey, Joe. Streebeck, what are you doing here? Joe, who is this nice looking young man? He's nobody, my partner. Streebeck, introduce yourself to my grandmother, quickly. Well, what a pleasant surprise. Granny Friday. Not that it's any of your business, she's my maternal grandmother. Her name is Mundy. - Why don't we all discuss this over dinner? It's my birthday. We're going to the Brown Derby. Do join us, Detective Swayback. - Streebeck. - Pep. - Granny, I don't think it's such a good idea. Why not, Joe? Yeah Joe, why not? - Yes, well it's just that I've invited someone already to join us and you don't really know her. She's... - Her? - Her? Joe! You have a date? oh, I'm so proud. (thump) - Well, in that case, it looks like I have a date too. Granny Mundy, may I escort you to Joe's car? I'd be privileged, Detective Star Trek. - 9:00 p.m., exactly one night after witnessing the satanic cult rally, I escorted my maternal grandmother to her favorite restaurant, the famous Brown Derby. There was someone I wanted her to meet, and it certainly wasn't Detective Streebeck. Sergeant Friday, your table is ready. I took the liberty of pouring the Dom Perignon. What Dom Perignon? - Oh, I stopped and phoned in an order in honor of Granny Mundy's birthday. Well, you'd want her to have the most expensive kind, wouldn't you? What a thoughtful gesture. Don't you think so, Joe? - Yes, Granny, it was very considerate of him. Hello, Joe. Guess I'm early. I was kind of excited. You sly minx. - Connie, I'd like you to meet my maternal grandmother, Mrs. Grace Mundy. Granny, this is the virgin, Connie Swail. You're kidding? Hi. Well, allow me. The place of honor for Granny. - Thank you. - Certainly. And if I may, a toast to Granny Mundy, may you live as long as you want, but never want as long as you live. (clinks) - Hear hear. Ahhh. - [Connie] This is such a happy restaurant. - Commissioner Kirkpatrick, how nice to see you again. Reverend Whirley, it's a privilege. An aperitif, perhaps? - You know, I once saw Alan Hale Jr. in here. Alan Hale Jr., wow! Gilligan, little buddy. - Streebeck, you just make sure you don't order anything more expensive that the world famous Cobb salad, and that is a direct order. Oh my God. Connie? That's him. That man with the collar. The Reverend Whirley? - He's the one who kidnapped me and threw me in that pit with that horrible snake. I'll never forget his face as long as I live. Connie, you have to be sure about this. How about very, very sure. I'm positive, Joe. That's him. The face behind the mask. The man who tried to kill me. - Connie, would you be willing to testify to that under oath in a court of law? Wait, wait a minute, settle down here. Let's think about this. Now that is Jonathon Whirley, head of the Moral Advance Movement of America. He's a public hero. You can't just walk up to him... - Streebeck, free-roaming vermin aren't allowed inside restaurants in this city. I'll simply be enforcing the public health code. Now if you'll both excuse me, I'm afraid the second highest duty calls. (chuckles) (laughs) - Joe, he is sitting with the Commissioner and our Captain. You go bust him now, tomorrow you'll be mucking out stalls down at the horse patrol. Thank you. I am sorry. Hold it right there, Whirley. Police officer, you're under arrest. I beg your pardon, what is this? Some sort of feeble joke? No, it's a real knee-slapper, friend, if you consider California penal code sections 484207, A597, and 217 theft, kidnapping, cruelty to animals, attempted murder, something to laugh about. [Whirley] I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about. - My partner and I witnessed that little torchlight picnic you threw last night, and we're gonna put you where your kind always ends up, in a seven by seven foot gray-green metal cage on the 15th floor of some hundred year old penitentiary with damp stinking walls and a wooden plank for a bed. Sure this city isn't perfect. We need a smut-free life for all our citizens, cleaner streets, better schools, a good hockey team. But the big difference between you and me, mister, is you made the promise and I'm gonna keep it. (applause) - Our good reverend's an amazing piece of work, isn't he, Jane? May I call you Jane? - No. - Captain, Commissioner, I demand an immediate explanation for this outrageous behavior. It's him again. Are you insane? - Commissioner, the Reverend Whirley abducted that girl over there, had his men throw her into a pit filled with criminally polluted water, and a giant Bolivian jungle snake. - oh, Jane, these accusations are preposterous. I beg to differ, ma'am. Just ask him if he remembers about 3,000 gallons of stolen trichlornitromethane and the pseudohalogenic compound cyanogen, which when mixed properly, form a liquid fertilizer that burns the throat, the eyes, the lungs, the nose, and could cause vomiting and even death. Friday, we're just about to eat here. Reverend Whirley, please, please accept our most sincere apologies. Sergeant, you will remove those handcuffs immediately. Then you will hand in your badge. You are relieved from duty. But, but, but Commissioner. Now. Yes sir, ma'am. I don't care. Won't you please change your mind? I know the young man was over zealous, but he springs from the great tradition. Commissioner, won't you please change your mind? Joe, I'm afraid I'll have to take your badge and gun. Captain, if we could just please... I don't wanna discuss it. Just hand them over. (melancholy music) Look, Joe, don't worry. I'm still on active duty. I'm buildin' a case. You're buildin' nothin'. Streeback, if I ever hear you've come within one mile of the Reverend Whirley, I'll have your badge for breakfast. Understood? Yes, sir. - It was very nice of you to try and take us out to dinner, Joe. Yeah, yeah, thanks, Joe, for everything. - Well, let's not all stand around here moping, I'm hungry, let's go for chili dogs. - Granny, have you ever eaten a chili dog off the back of a motorcycle? Not 'til now. You smooth-talking son of a gun. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'm very sorry you lost your job, Joe. I really did have a very good time. I'm glad, Connie. Now fasten your seatbelt. I can still affect a citizen's arrest, and I wouldn't wanna ruin a wonderful evening by bringing you in on a misdemeanor charge. That was a joke. Oh. ♪ Never knew the closing of a door ♪ ♪ Could open up a heart ♪ ♪ Since the day we met I needed you ♪ ♪ In my life ♪ oh, Joe. Look at the stars. Dozens of them. You know, when I was a little girl, I used to wish upon a different star every night for that special someone to come along. Someone with whom I could share everything. And I guess that's not so unusual. All girls do that, don't they, Joe? Some guys do too, Connie. - Joe? - That's me. Was there ever anyone else? Of course there was. Oh. - Actually, I've only been driving with Streebeck for a couple of days now. Before that I was with Frank. That's not what I meant, Joe. Oh. (thump) (scream) Oh my God, earthquake, it's the big one. Joe, help, help. - [Joe] Request code three, request code three. officer in distress, assist officer. Wait, I'll handle this. Calm down, calm down. (crash) (gasp) - January 9th, 8:37 a.m., my name's Streebeck. I'm a cop. I overslept. Curiously enough, I still hadn't heard from my anal-retentive ex-partner. Although I was sure he'd be proud to know I was making a concerted effort to personally develop a close relationship with one of my sisters in the Los Angeles Police Department. (gentle music) I placed a call to the virgin, Connie Swail, but according to the girl's mother, she hadn't come home either. I don't know what to say, Mrs. Swail. I'm beginning to be somewhat concerned myself. No, no, Joe Friday has never stayed out all night either. Well, the day he was born his mother had him home by 9:00. Well, let's both stay in touch in case we hear from them. Thank you, Mrs. Swail. - Oh my goodness, I'm gonna be late for my stakeout. - As enchanting as Robin was, I still couldn't get my mind off what happened to Joe Friday. You know, for one misguided moment, I actually pictured my ex-partner introducing that little Orange County cupcake to the one piece of his equipment that wasn't issued to him by the department. But then I realized, Joe would never spring for the price of a decent motel room, and since having sex in a Yugo is a logistical impossibility, I came to the conclusion that something must be wrong. Who cares? Now you listen to me, Captain. Joe Friday was the most dedicated cop in this city. Okay, so maybe all his dogs aren't attached to one leash. He's thick-headed and insensitive and reactionary and generally less fun to be around than any person I've ever met, but still. He was my partner. You wanna find Joe Friday, Streebeck? My advice is to start checking out the sanitariums. - Hey, Pep. - What's shakin', Ron? Hey, you! Me, Pep? Detective Streebeck to you, rookie, now let's get this mop trimmed, stop shaving with a pocket knife, and the next time you eat your lunch, you put it in you stomach, not on your uniform. You're a disgrace to this department and to that badge on your chest. (organ music) You're late, Jerry. I saw your little announcement about my so-called million dollar contribution. Do yourself a favor, friend. Try the lottery. The lottery I can fix. our problem is Mayor Parvin. I'm afraid he is not going gentle into that good night. Say what? - That he is not responding to our pressure to resign. Gonna have to push him over the edge. That million dollar contribution of yours will ensure his presence at your party tonight. Just make sure he turns into a drug-crazed idiot, complete with pictures. And once he's politically dead, Commissioner Kirkpatrick will be a shoe-in to replace him in the next election. You and I will split effective control of the city. You'll monopolize all pornography, half the poor, dumb sheep in Los Angeles will be forking over money to buy your sleaze, while the other half will be funding me with the means to fight it. Reverend, you got balls as big as church bells. Thank you. Jonathon, I do not trust that man. Well, thank goodness he trusts me. That socially retarded hedonist actually believes he's gonna be alive tomorrow. (pensive music) Where's Joe Friday? (grunts) It's no use, these knots are too tight. Untie the girl, she's coming with me. - You hypocritical maniac, if you had one common shred of decency left, you'd let her go and kill me instead. Instead? But my dear Sergeant Friday, I'd always planned on killing you. - How do you see yourself going down in history, mister? P.A.G.A.N., a reverend, devil, or angel? Why both, of course. one can't exist without the other. Without the Jerry Caesars, there'd be no moral outrage. And what's the good of moral outrage unless you have something tangible to direct it against? By this time tomorrow, thanks to that poison gas you've been tracking like some flu-ridden blood hound, Mr. Caesar will be sitting in that great big jacuzzi in the sky, and I'll control both sides of the equation. - Uh huh, sure, but just like every other foaming, rabid psycho in the city with a fool-proof plan, you've forgotten you're facing the single finest fighting force ever assembled. The Israeli's? - Try the decent, hard-working men and women of Los Angeles. (snorts) - Forgotten about them? (laughs) My dear Sergeant, I'm absolutely counting on them. Joe. Joe. (melancholy music) - Wise up, fellas, you may have taken a wrong turn somewhere in life, but there's still time to straighten out. - You're the one that's gonna straighten out, cop. All the way down the mountain. (thunk) Let's go, Streebeck. (fast paced music) (gun shots) (gun shots) (gun shots) (tires screech) (gun shots) - Just relax, Friday, and hold on tight, tighter. Pretend I'm Connie. [Joe] Streebeck, there's no road here. (gun shots) (mysterious music) Look, there's the mayor. Pretty clever of Whirley maneuvering him up here to Caesar's party. Now he's got both people he wants to eliminate in one place. Hey, isn't that Whirley's car? Good evening, Reverend. Child. I don't see Connie, I don't see Connie. Alright, the next car comes, follow me in. Wait, you can't go in there. - And since when did you become Miss Manners? - In the first place, you don't have a warrant. - California penal code section 836, a police officer may make an arrest without a warrant if he believes there is probable cause to believe... - You're not a police officer anymore, Joe. I hate to be the one to break that to you, but it's the truth. You go charging in there now, you're never gonna get your badge back. - Whirley's the only one that knows where Connie is, and he's gonna tell me or I'm gonna shove that collar so far down his throat, I'll have to take off his shoes to wring his neck. Will you listen to yourself? You're not even thinking like a cop anymore. You're thinking like a man in love. You just watch your language, mister. Oh, Joe, I... You've never really had these feelings before, have you? Almost. I had a kitten once. - Yeah, this is gonna be a little different. See, Connie is not gonna be sleeping in a box or meowing all night or climbing up your drapes. or maybe she will, I don't know. You both are sorta starting from scratch with this thing. - Get outta my way. - Hey hey hey. Last time you went after Whirley, you got suspended. You go in there now, you're gonna get arrested. On what charge, junior? How 'bout section 146A? That's right, impersonating a police officer. It's for your own good, Joe. You know, in spite of every logical instinct I've ever had in my life, I consider you a friend, a real friend. Streebeck, wait. Joe, go home. Go home, there's nothing more you can do here, believe me. And by the way, my name is Pep. It's not mister or junior or bub or even Streebeck. It's Pep. Friendships start with first names, Joe. (gentle violin music) Thank you so much for coming. Your honor, pleased you could make it. - Thank you. - You too of course, Reverend. - Alright, let's just drop the fake civility, okay Caesar? I believe you have a check for the reverend here. Yes I do, all in due time. - If it would make us all feel a little better, why don't I just hold on to it until the formal presentation. Well, whatever. (laughs) Gentlemen, you're just in time. We're about to start our cultural talent show here. Why don't you pull up a pew next to me.
