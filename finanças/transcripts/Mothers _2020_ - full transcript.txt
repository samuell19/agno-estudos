Truthfully, I loved him... How did you get to see him? When he called me on the phone, even if we had guests at home, I’d leave everything behind to meet him. I’d lie to my family. I’d pretend to run an errand or go to the bakery and I’d go off to see him. Why didn’t you tell your mom or dad? It wasn’t easy, I was scared. I couldn’t just say: « I'm pregnant. ». They think you’re still a virgin. I was always home at night. I never went out for more than an hour. Whenever they asked questions, I’d lie to them. My mother felt something weird about me. She told me she didn’t like my going-outs. She suspected that I hid something, but I just denied it. When I felt she was about to find out, I just left home. I have sisters who haven’t been to school. I know that my sister would never do that. It is impossible. I’m sure she would never do such a thing. That « woman »… Who went off to do this… She can’t pretend she is a victim. « You did it willingly. » « So you’re responsible for having that child. » « No one forced you. You can only blame yourself. » « Don't blame the State or Society. » I agree that the child is a victim. But the mother is not, she is guilty. The man didn’t force her. « Let’s have fun… ». I’m sure he didn’t. He talked to her. She’s mature to decide. Why are we all here? To know better. To learn enough to be responsible. For what? For our sex life. I agree with you: the girl is responsible. She’s easy-going. But it needs two people to make a child. So they’re both equally responsible. What is the man’s position in adultery? Let’s assume the woman makes a mistake, why should the man follow her? Even nowadays, women don’t initiate sexual relationships. I can’t deny it happens sometimes. But given our culture, our social conventions and education… It’s all about how we raise our daughters. They’re educated differently. From birth, there are differences between girls and boys. When you were born, ululation broke out, whereas when your sister was born, there might have not been any. Maybe your mother sacrificed a sheep to celebrate your birth, but for your sister, only a chicken. I am surprised that single mothers is still an issue. We’ve been talking about them since 1980. It’s such a delicate situation. We’re very aware of that issue, yet if it ever happened in our family, we’d be scared. Because it makes you an outlaw and it’s hard to accept. Latifa! Good morning. - How are you? - I'm fine... - Everything’s alright? The kids? - Everything’s going well. You? Kids are growing up just fine. You take good care of them. - Good morning girls, how are you doing. - How are you Aicha? How are the children? Ok... - let me give you a hug. You Ok? - Yeah... - How are you Nacira? - I am Ok... All the women who come here, I mean all of them, they’re here to give away their babies. So your mother knows you’re pregnant. She asked you to get rid of the baby and to come back home, right? Your mother is asking you to have a c-section so you can pretend you’re still a virgin. I am not a doctor. I respect your choice. But virgin or not, you’re pregnant and you’re going to give birth soon. Do you understand? You’re soon to be a mother. Even if your mother can’t accept it, that’s a fact. It’s alright. We’ll protect you. I can call your mother to straighten things up with her. It is up to you both to tell your father or not. But you, what do you want to do with the baby? You’re the one responsible for it. - You should at least let your mother know. - No, I can’t. - Just her… - No I can’t. She’ll die if I tell her. - Why would she? - No way. But you have to. What if you died while giving birth? Who should we call? Who will take care of the baby then? Have you thought about your baby? If you die during the delivery, and it can happen to anyone… who will take care of your baby? You will. We can’t! We’re not an orphanage. We’re just an association. We can only look after children during work hours. Only orphanages can do it at night. No way, I can’t. This baby should at least know your brothers! He won’t have a father, let it at least have its uncles. - No, no! - You have to be consistent with yourself. I want to keep my daughter without telling anyone about her until she’s older. What will you tell them when she’s older? I’ll bring her home and tell them she’s my daughter. How to be sure you won’t abandon your baby once it’s born? No way. I will keep her and raise her. Are you sure? Look: If it were a boy… Maybe I’ll abandon him. But either a son or a daughter, it’s your child! No, girls are not like boys. Girls are tender. If you believe in what you say, then you wouldn’t think you could abandon your son. A tender woman doesn’t abandon her child, be it a girl or a boy. All the women who come here are well advanced in their pregnancy. They never come in their 2nd or 3rd month of pregnancy. Why? Because they still doubt their pregnancy. They are not sure until they go see a doctor. They first ask fortune-tellers and charlatans. But after the 3rd month of pregnancy, their bodies start changing, the baby moves. And it’s too late then. They come to us at the latest moment, during the 8th month, sometimes at the eve of their delivery. Then we can’t have them change their mind. Tell me, Madam Karima, what will you do with your baby when it’s here? I will keep it. But what about your family? Your father? Your mother knows about your pregnancy, right? What does she think? What did she tell you when she sent you here, to Agadir? She asked me not to tell anyone in the family. But how will you make it? How will you keep your baby when it’s born if your family doesn’t know about it? Will you tell your father? You’ll never live in peace. You’ll always be torn between your child and your family. Why should your child live in fear? It is what it is. I can understand when you say you’ll keep your baby and you will not care about what people think. But saying « I want to keep my child but won’t let my father know about it » is nonsense. It means one thing only: you’ll abandon your child after the delivery and go back home. If you want to stay here, you must know the rules: No arguments with the other girls. You should help each other. No mobile phones. Houseworks are in turn, as if you were at home. If something bothers you, you should talk the day or the night manager. We will keep your mobile phone. You’ll get it back once you leave. - Do you have it here? - Yes. Give it to me please. - Have you turned it off? - Yes. Do it slowly, one by one. That’s enough. Just turn off the heat, it is cooked. Honestly, Fatimezzahra, if I were you and had to deliver at the hospital, even if my pregnancy is illegal, I would call my parents. Because neither me nor the social assistants nor the nurses at the hospital can do better than your mother. - For sure. And both of your parents will know how you feel, that day. They won’t blame you. They might be angry, or might scold you, but they will never let you down. So please, Fatimezzahra, try to reconsider your decision. Take your time, one or two weeks, but tell your parents before you deliver, this will give you peace of mind. - Good evening, how are you? - Fine... How was your day? Who has had contractions? - Siham. - Siham? What about you? Both Siham and me. Don’t worry, everything will be OK. Everything’s OK. - Whose turn? - It’s me, Mamie Saadia. - Please come with me. - I’m coming. Yesterday I went to the hospital with Fatimezzahra. - Take care of her. - Don’t worry, I will. Apart from that, the girls are OK? They’re OK. If you need anything, just call me. Can you please set the table for dinner? Should I heat up the soup? You don’t have to. Now we know what motherhood means. It’s not something you learn in newspapers or on TV. We now feel what motherhood is. And I am sure of that: Once a woman gets pregnant, no matter how she got pregnant. There is no legitimate or illegitimate mother. A mother is a Mother. Girls can go to school today… We now even have women who are engineers, pilots, university teachers… But in fact it’s still the same, because culture and mentality have not changed. Since her childhood, when a girl does something good « May God bring you a good husband. » « Go get some water... May God bring you a good husband » « Go tell that to your brother... May God bring you a good husband » « Call your father... May God bring you a good husband » « See who knocks on the door... May God bring you a good husband » « Look through the window... May God bring you a good husband ». When a girl comes to see us, at first she is scared. She feels guilty. Because it’s only then that she wonders about her uncles and father’s reactions. When she was in her relationship, the world seemed to be normal, the situation itself looked ordinary. She sees this kind of things on TV. She is engaged, her fiancé is here, everybody dances and is happy. After the engagement, her mother, the entire family let her go out with her fiancé. It’s the context itself that betrays those girls. This is what we call social hypocrisy, and it’s what’s most dangerous. Do you need to see a doctor? - No. - But you are tired, mom... - Shall I call the doctor for you? - No. - Who am I? - You are my daughter Mahjouba. - Can you remember that? - Yes! Yes you’re right, mom. You are my Mahjouba. Who am I? My little Mahjouba... - Your little Mahjouba? - Yes. Are you sure, mom? I swear you are! I swear to you. - … OK? - I am in the kitchen… One question: were you in love with him? In fact I’ve known him for… No! Please answer my question. Are you in love with him? Even if your father is here, tell me if you love him. Love is a sacred feeling, it’s a gift from God. Do you love this man? - But in front of the judge… - Please Sir… No need to refer to relationship or rape. I’m asking her if she loves that man. Does he love you? Do you feel that he loves you? And you? Me too. It means you love each other, right? It is not a problem, you have to say it, don’t be ashamed! This man is your father, not your enemy. Parents are the most precious persons on Earth. We now ask ourselves that question: If a woman goes out willingly with a man… … Shall we call him a rapist? - Please Sir, listen to me carefully. - Yes, absolutely. For sure he didn’t force her to go out with him. She wanted to… So she did it willingly, and so did he. He came to me and acknowledged he was the father of the baby. But when my daughter disappeared, I immediately went to report to the police. Which was very good! You complied with the law then. When my daughter reappeared, I went with her to the police station to inform them that she was back. - Because your daughter is still under-18s. The police asked her questions. She told them everything. They arrested him. He was arrested and brought to justice. The law has been applied because she is under-18s. And now he’s accused of being a rapist. But now, in Morocco, we keep asking ourselves this question: When a woman goes out willingly with a man, shall we consider him a rapist? That’s a problem too. Should we send men to prison because they go out with women just for fun. They don’t want to have children. Those idiots! They know it and say it: « I was with her for the fun, not for having children. ». When this problem occurred, I went to the hospital and asked the nurse for the vaccination needed. She refused to do it because I was not married. What did you ask for exactly? Just vaccination: I was told to make vaccine in my 4th month of pregnancy. You need that too? Ilham, the nurse has absolutely no right to refuse that. A current campaign strictly prevents to ask pregnant women to provide the marriage certificate. And this is your task, as educated women who go to university. You make studies, you should look for right information. It is your task, young people, to know the rights brought by the new family code. Either you’re a woman or a man, in fact. Does the baby move? - Any nauseas? Do you feel tired? - Sometimes. - Do you suffer from stomach burn? - Yes… - And constipation? - Sometimes… - Cystitis? - No. - Any irritation in your vagina? - No… - Does anyone in your family suffer from diabetes? - No. - Hypertension? - No. Please... It is growing normally. Thanks God, that’s what we wish for. Its heartbeat is good. Let’s go. Be careful and close the doors when I leave. Peace and prayers on God’s messenger. Peace and prayers on God’s messenger. Oh, My lady, In the name of God, Oh, My lady, I pray for God’s messenger. Oh, my dear beloved, love of my life, Here is my dowry, Here is my offering. I will hire a field from his owner. Oh, my dear Lady, in the grain market I will buy seeds. And we will go early in the morning to the countryside. Oh, my dear Lady, We will start what we intend to do. Peace and prayers on God’s messenger. Peace and prayers on God’s messenger. Oh, dear Lady, We will go to the countryside. Oh, dear Lady, We will start what we intend to do. I will plough the land with my own hands, I will work on it with my own hands, And we will ask God. To make it rain, To make the seeds germinate. Some more sugar? I will put you only some. - Do you want to see your mother? - Yes of course. Is your parents’ phone number in the association’s office? Yes. There is broth if you want some. When you’re ready to leave, we’ll bring you to the girls’ home and do the rest. - Have you breastfed him or not yet? - Yes I did, but … - There is no excuse … - There comes no milk. You should breastfeed him even if there is nothing now. Milk will come little by little. Every time he cries, breastfeed him. But don’t give him the baby bottle, please. It’s no good neither for you nor for him. Hey! Good morning! From time to time, breastfeed him. Don’t forget him. Not once. Even if you sleep, don’t forget to feed him. You give him a little bit of this breast and a little bit of the other. Otherwise they will swell. Relax and don’t think about anything. Every problem has a solution. God is great. He won't forget you. See you and take care. - Say hi to Madam Mahjouba for me. - I will. No, I was… what shall I say… Listen to me, please, don’t be shy and talk frankly. I am your lawyer. If you can't speak freely with me, what will happen in court? What will happen in front of the police? Tell me what really happened, or I won't be able to help you. So what happened? He was always there to fetch me when I left work. I used to finish late in the evening, 9 or 10 pm, by then... He was always there waiting for me. - Do you live far from work? - Yes. No one from your family to give you a ride? Your elder brother? - Is your father still alive? - He is, but he lives in the countryside. - He’s not with you? - No, he doesn’t live with us. Sir, he’s dead to them, he abandoned his children when they were young. Now you have to file a complaint to protect yourself. This man should be punished. He should be responsible for his actions. He took you to the woods whenever he wanted to have you... And now that you’re pregnant, he throws you away. Now you’re a victim. If you don’t say anything, you’ll be considered guilty. Would you rather protect him as an accomplice or defend yourself as a victim? You shouldn’t be shy in front of the police or in court. You shouldn’t hide in silence. Tell them everything in details. Tell them he raped you. Tell them he forced you to have sex with him. You should say that. Because if you don’t say it… They'll think you're hiding something. It's still considered a crime, even if no one charges you for it: You are pregnant without being married. The court will send you to jail on prostitution charges. I don't want to scare you. I'm just being honest. This is how it works. Besides, pregnant women are weaker. No one will offer you a job. Even if you're looking for a place to live, the owner will see your belly... And he'll ask about the father. If you tell him you don't have a husband, he'll shut the door on you. He'll be too scared to deal with you. People might think he's running a brothel. This is the law in our country. Hi Madam Mahjouba, how are you? I'm sorry to bother you, but I have to call you when there is an emergency. The nursery manager says they're out of fish, cheese, pastas and tomato sauce… Didn't you tell me you've found a donator who could bring us some supplies? And you told me he'd bring us everything we needed... before we see what we will receive. So I'd rather wait for his help than buy supplies myself. Ok... Please, madam, tell me what’s wrong in details. Whenever I gather all the documents I need, my man lets me down and leaves. - Your husband? Are you married? - No. So you’re not married. You are in a relationship with a man without being married, and you have children together, correct? - Yes. - We have four children together. - And you’re not married, right? - We’re not. - And you've had four children. - Yes. Did you add them to your family record book? - No. - So you didn’t. What does this man think? Where is he? He always gets all the documents, except that one, and then he leaves. The recognition of paternity? The recognition of paternity is done. So, just to be clear, are the children registered in the family record book? No, not yet. So you have to get an acknowledgement of parentage first. The children are obviously yours because you gave them birth. But he should acknowledge his children first. Fatima will tell you which documents you should provide for each of your children. Then we can add them all to the family record book. And it'd be best if he acknowledged you as his wife in addition to this. If he doesn't, it might cause issues. Because under Moroccan law, having children out of marriage is similar to prostitution. The law recognizes only children born from married parents. Now there is a temporary decree allowing mothers to register their children if they haven’t done it yet. It was over, but the King has extended it twice and I don't think he'll do it again. It’s your last chance to solve this. Last chance to secure your rights. We’ll take care of the rest. And stop making children. That’s enough for children… Once, twice and even four times. You should take advantage of this decree while it's in effect. And the association can help you. And you are in good health. Hopefully your man is onboard. We'll help you with the rest. Right now we need gas, pastas… We’re running short of everything: milk, baby diapers… A donator brought us some wheat last Saturday. We've been buying bread for a month rather than bake it. How much? 600 Dirhams (65 US Dollars)? And don’t tell me it’s not enough, there are more donations to come, Inshallah. Start buying the crucial things. I won’t let the girls starve! My dear Hafida, I'm doing my best. If I could I’d give you all the cash we have. I don’t want it! OK, just start with the most urgent supplies. I’m going to buy 2 bottles of gas… and some chicken, some eggs… You know why I only gave you 600 Dirhams (65 US Dollars)? Because I told Madam Mahjouba I would give enough money only for priority supplies. OK, so first of all we’ll keep you here in our girls’ home. Do you understand? Because if you leave here, you'll end up on the streets. No one will want you in their house when they learn you're pregnant. And nobody will give a job to someone who's 8-months pregnant. No one is going to hire you. You should listen to me and go to the girls’ home. Then we’ll call your mother, because we’ll have to call her now or later. But I don’t want my mother to know about it… If she ever knows what happened, they'll kill me, I'm as good as dead... Listen to me please. We’re no longer in barbaric times. I know them well. Nowadays we can solve every problem by discussion. You no longer get hurt or killed over that. Your pregnancy is a fact now. And you should talk it over with your parents. Or this will get worse as time goes by. This will get you into even bigger trouble. But if you calm down, listen to me, and you come live in the girls’ home, then tomorrow you’ll give me your mother’s phone number and I’ll call to tell her not to worry about you. I'll tell her where you are to make her stop looking for you. If you stay here and deliver under our care, the nurses won’t call the police. But if you want to go to the hospital, they will immediately call the police to protect themselves from unlawful births. Are you listening to me? You might be convicted for prostitution. But if you stay here, we will protect you. So you need to decide quickly if you want to stay here. And if so, I'll call your mother tomorrow or even today, before she calls your friends and your neighbours and alarms everyone. Then it'll be hard to keep it quiet when she finds out. That’s why it’s best to call her now. And tell her you are here. And make sure she won't call anyone. Hello, Madam Khadija… How are you? How’s your health? Fine? Khadija? Please listen carefully. No one should know what I am about to say. Can you hear me? Please keep calm. We don’t know each other, but we were destined to meet. What I’m going to tell you, no one should know about it. I am the President of Oum Al Banine Association. We’re an association that takes care of women in troubles. Fatima came here to see me. But you have to remain calm. I told you, Fatima is here. I’d like you to come tomorrow with her father. She is here, at the association. In Agadir... I can’t tell you over the phone. No way, I can’t tell you. Please, keep calm. I can’t tell you over the phone. Please come tomorrow at 10 am. Young people don’t know which way to go. They’re asked to pick the forbidden fruit but they are forbidden to eat it. In developed countries, there are only two ways to go. Not here, in Morocco. Here we are: human rights, customs and habits, religion, civilization, globalization, internet, smartphones… I am not saying it’s all bad. But this change should have been prepared for 50 years ago in order to follow up the evolution in harmony with ourselves. If we were intended to be part of it. I have a long record with men. Throughout my career, Everybody told me: « Men are bad. ». I thought that too. I no longer say it now. I can’t say anymore: « Men are bad and hard. ». They don’t have the opportunity to prove they can do better. This is Hafida, our home manager. Take care of her. She has all the papers. How many months is she at? The doctor hasn’t told it yet. I’ll make it short so you can have a rest. I’ll show you where you’ll stay. There are 4 girls here. Another is in the hospital. You’re the 6th one. We’ll talk tomorrow. Now you should have a rest. You can have a shower once the night supervisor lady comes. Store your clothes in the closet. I will show you your bed. Your parents know you’re here? No. Madam Mahjouba will tell them today. None of them know, right? None of them… That’s why you couldn’t sleep… You couldn’t tell them? No. They know nothing. Does anyone else know you’re pregnant? I can’t hear you… - Only a girl knows… - Your sister? - No. A friend, in Casablanca. - A friend is only a friend… What are you afraid of, besides your parents? Who else are you afraid of? I don’t care about the others. I care about my parents only. Sure, they are the most important people. Whom are you the most afraid of, your father or your mother? Both of them. Both of them? But who are you closest to? Who could you tell first? I am closer to my father but I can’t tell him that. You should let someone tell him for you. Can you call Nacira, please? I need her. - Is everything OK? - It’s OK, thanks God. Khadija… Tell me what’s going on. We need to know… Please. First, is everything OK? Health? How could everything be OK? Life… Be brave. It’s God’s will. We must accept it... You understand? She arrived yesterday. And I called you so you wouldn’t worry about her. She left without saying anything. She couldn’t say anything. At least she could have told me… Her sisters don’t listen to us anymore. This problem is to be solved... They want to leave home too. That had to be taken care of before. Now there is a real problem. And we have to solve it all together. You are neither the first nor the last ones to whom it happens. And it happens everywhere in Morocco. I don’t want to hurt you neither to make you wait any longer. Fatima is pregnant and she’ll deliver very soon. She’ll deliver very soon. Please keep calm. That’s why I didn’t tell anyone. Because only you and I can share and solve this. Did she say who the father is? Step by step! She only arrived around 1.30 pm. I work in a farm and I finish working at 4 pm. Khadija… I left her at home… Khadija… Khadija, the problem is that you don’t look around you. Your daughter’s body has changed. She got fat because she doesn’t do anything. She stays home. She’s very coated! I saw she had waves of nausea. I told her father. We’ve been working in the fields since May. She didn’t feel well. Her father told me: « Maybe she’s pregnant. ». But he didn’t do anything. No one helped me. Let’s talk about something else. Now you should come together and support each other. You shouldn’t quarrel. Think about your other daughters. This is Fatima’s fate. Please don’t insult each other. I want a divorce. A divorce? Who? What? Is this all you can do? … Fed up with this marriage… … With this life… Khadija… May God bless you and bless your parents. I called you to let you know about your daughter, not to quarrel. If I hadn’t, you wouldn’t know where she is, and this would be a major problem. But it’s not the case, thanks God. - Where is she now? - We’ll see that later. Please Khadija, don’t put all the blame on her. Now it is what it is. Keep calm. Khadija… Calm down… Khadija… It’s not a way to solve problems. Should we love our children only if they are nice? Please. May God bless your father. I want to solve this problem. Stay strong and brave. I know it’s not easy, darling. If your daughter hadn’t come here, things would have gone even worse. And so would your stress. Calm down… I’m here for you. We’re here for you. Please stop crying… - Did you call on her mobile phone? - Yes. Please, see how strong her father is. Madam Mahjouba is coming there with Fatima’s parents. Don’t tell her. OK, I am here. It’s really an education issue. We don’t let our children be independent early enough. We don’t have them feel responsible on time. We’re like mother hens. And this makes the mother suffer, but she can’t see the pressure she puts on her children. She should let them live their lives as they want to, and let them take their own decisions. Mothers always interfere in their children life: their jobs, their wages, their private life… Mothers are responsible for their children behaviour. Hey Nadia! Take care of yourself. I miss you too. But we have so much work here! - I am no longer there. - Where are you now? - Congratulations! - You should come! I will! By the way, my condolences on Rachid. This is only your and your husband’s problem, no matter what you say. When you do that, you think of the family! Of the family’s reputation! Why do we call the parents, if they’re still alive? To let them decide to make up or not. Or to make any other choice. - Hello. - Hello Madam Mahjouba… Please ask Fatima to come here. OK… Tell her that her parents are here. - I asked her to put a headscarf. - No need to. Please Fatima, hurry up. You love this kind of clothes. They may be Sahrawi. I don’t know, I haven’t asked them yet. It’s beautiful! They are your parents. They gave birth to you. Please Fatima. Keep control. Be strong. They came here to see you. Let your father hold you in his arms. Now it is what it is. You should have told me. You should have told me everything. Kiss your mother. Thanks God. Remember what we said yesterday. Parents can be angry but they never let their children down. Everything’s fine… Stay strong. Calm down, Khadija. Please Khadija. May God curse the devil! In the office I told you to keep calm if you wanted to see your daughter. - Why didn’t you tell me? - How could I, Father? You could! You could have told me… No, she couldn’t, neither to her parents nor to her sisters. She was told here to let Mrs. Mahjouba and the social assistant call and tell you. She arrived yesterday, you arrived today. Thanks God for all. We couldn’t let her leave, it could be dangerous for her. She’s safe here. If you don’t learn to forgive, you can’t make any progress in life. Forgiveness counts. Of course! Should it be between husbands and wives, their children, between brothers and sisters, with one’s in-laws, between neighbours… Between the young people amongst themselves. There must always be forgiveness. We have to learn to forgive. We shouldn’t avoid it. Forgiveness helps life go on. You should thank God. There are girls pregnant like you who accidently deliver at home, in the bathroom. The baby dies and the entire family go to jail. Oh Saint Moses I am seeking your help. So my enemy will be defeated. Staying awakened overnight By the Law revealed. Take me with you. Oh Saint Moses I am seeking your help. When the sun rises And happiness came to me. Will it be always with me Is it finally justice or just sufferings. You who know the secrets of this world. Do you know whether this wall is made of clay or stones. I have been told. Oh you the glorious. Some people told but What happened. Next Monday, you’ll have spent 2 months here. This is your son’s health book. It’s very important for him and for you. Anywhere in Morocco you have the right to have your son’s vaccinations. When you go to the kindergarten, they’ll tell you where to find the nearest hospital. A last advice: Be a strong and determined woman. I hope to get good news from you and your child. I hope to hear that you take good care of your son. To hear that you found a job too. Life is not easy. Things are not the way they look like. Please Sarah, don’t cry, please. You’ll live with other girls. You won’t be alone. We’ll pay your first rent. If you don't get along well with the other girls, that’s your problem. You have to be smart. Now you’ll have to pay electricity, water, rent... The association will provide you with milk and clothes for your child. He can go to the nursery from 8 am to 6 pm. Then you’re responsible for him. Once you leave this place, you should think about looking for a job. Seek and you shall find. OK Sarah? Take good care of yourself. Take care of yourself. Don’t put yourself into trouble again. Now you’re responsible for a child. You came here with a baby in your belly. Now you’re holding it in your arms. Please wipe your tears. Girls, I’m going with Sarah see Mahjouba then I come back. Glad to see you're healthy. May peace be with you. Now you have a long way to go. Come, I’m showing you where you're going to live. The owner is fine: an elderly woman. She has diabetes and can be angry sometimes. Be nice to her. She protects you as well. If she scolds you, it’s in your interest. Anything to tell me? Any question to ask? I have nothing to say but « thank you very much. ». It is our duty, my dear. And our door stands wide open. If you need an advice or any help from us, call the listening desk. Social workers can help you there, for anything, be it a small or a big problem. Even for the most private thing that you can’t share with anyone. Social workers will help you. May God help you and bring you happiness. May God bless your son. May you be proud of him. May he go to school and become a good person. May God bring you happiness in your life. God is great and generous. And take good care of yourself.
