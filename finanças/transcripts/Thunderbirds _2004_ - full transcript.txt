From a secret island in the South Pacific... the courageous Tracy family run an organization called... International Rescue. When disaster strikes, anywhere in the world... they are always first on the scene. They go by the name they gave their incredible machines. The Thunderbirds. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Thunderbirds are go! But in this family of heroes, there is one son left behind. Gentlemen, we all know that A squared plus B squared equals? - C squared. - C squared. That's right. À But... What happens when we bring in Leonardo Da Vinci's E, F, and... Mr. Tracy? Alan. Alan! - How kind of you to come back from outer space, Alan. I trust re-entry wasn't too rough? Here on Earth, we've been discussing the Pythagorean Theorem. Did any of that happen to sink in? I was just... Apparently not. Thunderbirds are... go. I hope you aren't going anywhere special over spring break, Alan. Because I expect a 10,000 word paper on my desk the day you get back. That should keep you busy. "That should keep you busy." - You can take 10,000 words À and stick them up... - Alan! - Headmaster. - Mr. Tracy Ms. Garrett. You gotta be more careful, Alan. Why can't I tell them I'm a Thunderbird, Fermat? Because technically you're not yet. And if your identity was discovered, it'd-d-d... - it could be very bad. - I know, I know. It's the Thunderbirds! They're gonna be on TV. - Let's go, À they're gonna be on TV! - Whoa, whoa, where are they? - They're in Russia, À at an oil rig fire! - Great! I'm stuck at school and my brothers are on a cool mission. We are told the super rig is now in danger of total collapse. And there is real concern for the lives of six men who remain trapped on board. An emergency call went out to the Thunderbirds just a few minutes ago. They should be here any moment now. And here they are! Thunderbird 2, this is Thunderbird 1. I have visual south column. They're trapped on an inspection platform. FAB, we'll take it from here. Come on! Come on! - Scott, get out of there! À That tower's coming down! - Got it! Thunderbird 1, any damage? Negative, Dad. Come on, come on. Swing around. You can't get close enough taking that approach angle. Approach angle is no good. I'm gonna have to swing her around. Watch for wind shear, Thunderbird 2. I was watching for wind shear when you were still wearing diapers. Come on, Dad. Whoa, hold on! Who needs diapers now, Dad? - What'll they do now? - Drop the rescue platform À from Thunderbird 2. Open them up. Here we go. Rescue platform's on it's way. Virgil, how's it going? It's looking good, Dad. Come on, jump! Okay, I've got a visual. Hold it there. Targets locked. Firing rescue lines. Come on, hook them up! We gotta get you out of here! - Let's haul them out of there. - Commencing reverse thrust. Okay, let's bring them home. Look out! Gotta get them out fast. The rig's gonna blow. - Hang on! - Whoa! Whoa, sorry, boys. Hold on tight, here we go! Come on, Virgil. - Hold on, guys! - How are you doing, son? Never better! Thunderbird 1, commence knockdown procedure. FAB, Thunderbird 2. Lining up target. Fire. Yee-ha! - Bull's-eye! Outstanding shot. All right, boys. Let's take these babies home. The fire has been extinguished. The rocket fired from Thunderbird 1 has robbed it of the oxygen it needed to burn. Amazing. The Thunderbirds have done it again, Chuck. That was great work, Lisa. Thanks a lot. Ooo, I wish I could be a Thunderbird one day. - Thunder-turd. - Ooo. - That's another À good one, diaper boy. Tracy! There's someone here for you. Hello, boys. Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, at your service. Alan, darling. Your father's been detained and he's asked me to pick you up. - Is that all right? - Sure beats the bus. - Definitely. - Fantastic. Now, will any of these gorgeous young things be joining you? Me! Me! Just Fermat. Quite right. Lady Penelope, why are you in America? - Are you on a mission À for my father? - Alan, shh. I am an undercover agent, so please try to be discreet. Here we are. - Hi, Parker. - Good afternoon to you, À Master Hackenbacker. - Ow! - Hi, Nosey. - Less of that attitude À or I shall be obliged - to deliver À the Parker Haymaker. - Okay, bring it on, big guy. Try not to run over any children, Parker. Very good, m'lady. Come on, Parker, chop-chop. - All right! Yes! - FermatWhoa! Yeah. Oh, look, Parker. Pink is the new black this season. I'm very glad to hear it, m'lady. And hemlines are going up. That is good news, m'lady. And apparently England won the football last night. - Yes! Eng-er-land! - Whoa! Calm down, Parker. Yes, m'lady. Sorry, m'lady. Come on, baby. Out you jump. Wait till your father hears about this. Panhead! Aliens! Even better! It's the Thunderbirds! Okay, lock it up. Okay, people, let's move it. Let's go, let's move it. - Hey, we need some help over here. - Here you are, come down. Mission complete. Thunderbird 1. We are good to go. Fab. Tracking device activated. Ah, the chariot of the Gods. Having dallied with the mortals, they return to Olympus. And so I follow. Pardon me, m'lady, approaching Tracy Island. - Radar indicates À we have some company. Now that's showing off. I wish that was me. I'm about to run post-flight checks, Mr. Tracy. Anything I sh-sh-sh... anything you want to tell me? Brains, I noticed a build-up of vibration on Thunderbird 2 followed by illumination of the #5 engine-out light. Okay, I'll ch-ch... study the flight data in the guidance processor. - Dad! - Alan! - Let me look at you. À Oh, man. - Pop! - Uh-oh, look out. - Hey, sprout! - Hey buddy! - Dinner's ready. À Come and get it. Onaha, it smells delicious and I'm starved. So, Dad, I saw the mission on TV. It looked pretty dangerous. Saving lives is a dangerous business, but it's what we do. Do you think the fire was causing thermal updrafts? Whoa, enough shop-talk. I want to hear about school. School's boring. Plus, I've been thinking, Maybe I could be home educated now. That way I could sit in on missions from time to time. What do you think? No shortcuts, Alan. No school, no rockets. Say, why aren't you wearing your retainer? I'm getting this reading telling me the wind is blowing 60 knots right up my keister. - No kidding. - Did you try readjusting À the flaps? That's the first thing I did. It's not my first day on a Thunderbird. - Try and keep up. - Don't you have homework to do? Unless he's blown up this school like the last one. - Keep Alan away from the ships, he's a hazard. - Enough. Pass the salad. - No thanks. Haven't seen that much fire since that volcano in Fiji. That wasn't Fiji, that was Istanbul. N o, Istanbulas the earthquake. Nothing compares to Argentina. Dad, I'm not really hungry. Come on, Fermat, let's go. But... you... I'm not done. Okay. Kyrano, have you seen Lady P? - By the pool. - Of course. Parker. We're not suppose to go in there. We could get in trouble. Where did you get the access code for Thunderbird 1 anyway? Fermat, my friend, what you don't know can't hurt you. I'll be right there. It seems the fire at the oil rig was no accident. - Any suspects? - Not yet, but I'll keep À you posted. - Thanks for À bringing Alan home. - My pleasure. Any excuse to visit paradise. - Tintin! - Hey, Mr. Tracy. Hello, Tintin. - Good evening, Lady Penelope. - Did you know Alan's home? - Alan's back? I mean... Oh, Alan's back. Hey, Dad. When are those two gonna get along? When Tintin decides the time is right. Girls are always ahead of boys with that sort of thing. - What sort of thing? - Romance. Alan and Tintin? - I didn't see À that one coming. - No, you wouldn't. - Have a safe À flight home, Penny. - Thanks, Jeff. Okay, Fermat, run pre-flight checks. Right. Hydraulic systems are green. - Commence main engine sequence. - FAB, Alan. Couldn't hurt to just fire up the instruments. No, wait, Alan! À That's the... wrong switch! - Warning. - Engine sequence breach. - Oh, God. Warning. Engine sequence breach. - Can't this day À get any worse? - Alan, my office, now! It just did. I can't believe it. We are so busted. Look at this. What is it? Looks like some sort of... gallium electrolyte compound. Gotta get out of here. I know you're mad, I shouldn't have been in the ship, but if you... You're damn right you shouldn't have been in there! - But nothing happened. À I had it under control. - Under control? Do you have any idea the importance of secrecy in our operation? You fired up a Thunderbird without activating the anti-detection shield. You put everyone in danger when you act selfishly. You want to be part of the team, you have to play by the rules. You understand? Do you?! - Yeah, I understand. I understand you don't want me to be a Thunderbird. You don't want me to do anything! You won't listen to me when I'm trying to tell you something important! I've heard enough. You're grounded for the rest of spring break. - But, Dad! - Bottom line, Alan! You need to grow up. Then let me. Please. Hey, John, just about to turn in. What can I do for you? I could sure use a pizza. You know a place that delivers? 30 minutes or it's free, right? Anything else on your mind? Well, we've got a forest fire in Vladivostok, a typhoon heading for Singapore. What's happening on planet Tracy? Alan's home for spring break. Yeah, I thought I could see a storm brewing in your region. Teenagers. Well, we've all been there. - Dad, you've done a great À job since Mom died. - Thanks, John. Keep an eye on that typhoon for us. I'll call Vladivostok and see if they need any help with that fire. FAB, Dad. Sleep tight. - Morning, Dad. - Hey, son. There's something I'd like to sh-sh-sh... Here, take a look. The neural-net control system? It's great to have you back. I bet you didn't think spring break was gonna be this wo-wo... fun. Watch this? And the tiny phone lifts up. Perfect. Dad, it... N-n-n... almost perfect. There's something I wanted to talk to you about, Dad. Oh, right. Oh. Oh. Okay, right. You're having problems with a g-g-g... chi-chi-chi... wo-wo... female? N-n-no. No. Alan and I found some sort of... gallium compound on the nose-cone of Thunderbird 1. We should check that out st-st-st... immediately. Oh, that'd be gr-gr... swell! The island is in sight. Transom, I need you. Yes, sir. Sir, our cloaking device has evaded their detection systems. We have a positive visual from the tracking solution on Thunderbird 1. - Mullion? - Sir? Sir, armed and ready. Shall I target the main structure? Why would I want to destroy what will soon be mine? One of the principal tenets of Eastern martial arts is to use your opponent's strength against him. This is ridiculous. It will be almost impossible to force the Thunderbirds to leave their island. On the other hand, it requires no effort at all to let them go. The Thunderbirds' purpose is to rescue. All we need to do is give them a victim. - Commence targeting. - Straightaway, sir. Target acquisition of Thunderbird 5 is locked. Fire. Red alert. What the? Warning. Impact imminent. Thunderbird 5 to Tracy Island. Mayday. Mayday! Red alert. Red alert. Switching to command and control center. How bad, Brains? Thunderbird 5, major damage sustained. Possible m-m-m... possible strike by a m-m-m... - Meteor? - Yup. Thunderbirds are go! - Check retros. - Go. Guidance systems green. Go to maximum thrust. There goes the cavalry. But who will rescue the rescuers? Alan! Tintin! Thunderbird 5 has been hit! - Thunderbird 5 has been hit! - Okay, okay. Don't panic! On the other hand... Run! - We made land. - Cut them off. Activating communications blackout. Warning. Intruder alert. - Communications failure. - What the h-h-h... - Warning. Intruder alert. -... devil is going on? Communications failure. - Mr. Tracy, do you copy? - Warning. Intruder alert. - Thunderbird 3, please À respond. How'd they find the island? Do you think it was what I did in Thunderbird 1? - Do you think À I ruined everything? - No. That compound we found could have some sort of transmitting capability. We have to do something. My dad's in the control room, but how do we get there now? The vents. Let's go! We have to get a message to my dad. - Emergency power to 10%. - I'm losing all power. - Emergency power to 10%. - Repeat. - I'm losing all power. - Hold on, we're coming in. - Gordon, prepare for immediate docking. - You got it, Dad. Reverse main thrusters on my mark. Three, two, - one. - Easy, watch the roll. Roll index angle minus two degrees. Initiate docking sequence. - We're locked on. - Nice work. Docking sequence complete. - Tunnel hatch secured. Emergency packs, boys. Let's move! - Air lock pressure equalized. - We're in. Let's go! John! - Scott, tackle that fire. - Okay. - Am I glad to see you guys. - Easy, you're hurt. Virgil, take care of your brother. Gordon, give me a damage assessment. Come on, hurry. One-inch steel plate. With sequential titanium locking mechanism. I love a challenge. Watch out for the guards. Get in! Get in! Who-who-who-who... - What's going on? - So this is Mount Olympus. And these are the Thunderbirds. I should have guessed. Jeff Tracy. The billionaire ex-astronaut, of course. Isn't he the one who lost his wife in an accident? Avalanche, wasn't it? How tragic. Just keep going straight ahead. Okay. Professor Hackenbacker? We met at last year's international conference on nanotechnology. I thought your thesis on neutrinos was extremely... - stimulating. - Transom, concentrate. Sorry, sir. The command control switch is here. Fingerprint recognition system. Professor. Please. - Activate À the control switch. - N-n-n-n... you must be kidding. You and I share an interest in the science of the mind. The difference is I was born with my powers. Trust me when I tell you you've barely touched the surface. Even the strongest minds can be broken. It would be a pity to break yours. Fu-fu-fu... no way. Activate the control switch, Prof. Like a puppet on a string. Activating command and control. Activating command and control. - We have control. - Get up. Sorry, Professor. Nothing personal. We got a caution and warning light on our EPS system! Attempt manual override! No, that's negative! That's it. Okay, this one. Back to Thunderbird 3, now. John, we gotta move. The locking mechanism's jammed! Attention Thunderbird 5. You can see I've taken over your facilities. You no longer control your operational systems. They've taken over. Warm them up, Transom. Increasing temperature to maximum. - Who's the bald freak? - You. Dad! They've got my dad. Okay, you have our attention. Who are you? What do you want? Oh, how rude of me. You can call me "The Hood." Now, listen, Mr. Tracy, we won't be negotiating. I'm going to use the Thunderbirds to rob the largest banks in the world starting with the Bank of London. The world's monetary system will be in chaos and the Thunderbirds held responsible. You'll never get away with it! - Why the Thunderbirds? - An eye À for an eye, Mr. Tracy. An eye for an eye? Perhaps you've forgotten me, but surely you remember saving the life of my brother, Kyrano. I'm sorry, Mr. Tracy. I thought he was dead. Take them away. Yes, sir. Whoa. That makes The Hood my uncle? Every family has a black sh-sh... black sh... This vent's murdering my allergies. You left me to die that day. You may have broken my body, but you have no idea how powerful my mind has become. Now you will suffer, as I suffered, waiting for a rescue that will never come. Wait! Scott, status report. CO-2 levels are rising. Wire the oxygen scrubber to the emergency batteries. Clean the air. How long will that give us? About four hours. Someone's there. Time to go. - Ow! Run, run! No, jump. We can get through to the silos. Apparently the island is not as secure as you thought. Children? Did you find any children? Here they are. Thunderbird 2 silo, in the loading arm. Seal them in. Hold on! Whoa! - The doors, you guys. À Let's go, come on! - Go, go! This way. - No! - They've got us trapped. À What do we do now? If we can get to Thunderbird 1's silo, we can escape through the service tunnel. But we need a plan. - I'll use À the Thunderizer on the door. - Elevator active. - You guys get the goons À with the firefly. This equipment is only to be used in an emergency. - I guess this qualifies. - Yeah. Here they come! Fermat, can you drive this thing? Uh... no. Hey watch it! I took microbiology, not driver's ed. - Set the pressure À to maximum. - Got it. Retreat! Whoo! Let's move it! That's it. Time to thunderize. Yes! Come on, let's go! Get them! - Where's Fermat? - Fermat! - Fermat! Hurry up! - Coming! - What were you doing À back there, Fermat? - I had an n-n... idea. Just try and keep up, okay. I'll open the tunnel. We gotta keep moving. Access denied. - Go back, yell when you À see them coming. Access denied. Alan. You can run if you want. Were you surprised to hear what your father did to me? It is frightening when we realize our parents aren't perfect. But perhaps you already suspected that about your father. Why did he build these magnificent machines? Do you suppose it was guilt? Because he let your mother die. Open the door, Alan. Open the door. We can't go this way! He's there! No! Ow. What are we gonna do, Alan? I don't know. I'm thinking, okay? Keep backing up. I've got an idea. - That's your idea? - It's not me you're angry À at, Alan. It's not you I'm aiming at. Get them! Transom, fire up Thunderbird 1. And set to broil. - No sign of them. - Of course not. The little brats went up like firecrackers. Pop. Pop. Pop. Don't... give him the satisfaction, Professor. This has taken too long. Pick out the equipment you need to get into those banks and load it into Thunderbird 2. - No more delays. - Yes, sir. How about a little warning next time you pull a stunt like that? Relax, it's just a little water. I could have d-drowned. You mean you can't swim? I repeat, I could have d-drowned. I said I was sorry, Fermat. Let's just put this behind us, okay? We gotta watch each other's backs. - Nice drawers. - Thank you - Boo! - Ah! - Come on, stay there. - You're worse than À a couple of girls. Hurry up and get dressed. Those are nice drawers. Data from Tracy Island is sent to Thunderbird 5 - via satellite, right? - Right. So there's a minuscule possibility that if we reach the island's satellite station we could... - Blow it up. - No, we could hack into it and give control back to Thunderbird 5. - Good thinking, Fermat. À Let's do it. - Thank you. Here's the plan. We're here, right? So we go along the shore, around the mountain to the access road here. Then up to the transmitter. So what do you think? Good, except we're here, not there. And the transmitter is there, not here. We have to go through the jungle. But that's f-f... off limits. It's gonna be dangerous. I'm in. We gotta get up there fast. Our folks are in trouble and if The Hood gets off the island... He's not going anywhere for now. It's the guidance processor from Thunderbird 2. It can't take off without it. You're a genius. How did you get this? Alan, my friend, what you don't know can't hurt you. Parker? - M'lady? We have an emergency. What a charming fellow. Come in. Have a look at this, Parker. He, and this woman, poor girl, both work for this man, known as The Hood. Sounds like an alias to me, m'lady. Quite right, Parker. Real name Trangh Belagant. Assumed dead when his illegal diamond mine collapsed in the jungles of Malaya. Oh, perfect, Parker. The Thunderbirds rescued over 500 mineworkers in the collapse. Including Mr. Belagant's brother. M'lady, that's Mr. Tracy's loyal manservant, Kyrano. How's my schedule for today, Parker? You have clay pigeon shooting with Lord Marlborough, a benefit gala for the Institute of the Blind, and incidentally, there's a typhoon bearing down on Singapore. - I suppose that's urgent? - Yes, m'lady. There's also a bridge collapsed in Buenos Aires and a volcanic eruption in Jakarta. - The Thunderbirds À still haven't responded? - No, m'lady. And the media is awash in speculation vis... vis their whereabouts. Over to Lisa Lowe. Chuck, disaster after disaster around the world today and still no sight of the Thunderbirds. Typhoon Jago hit land in Singapore just one hour ago and thousands have been left homeless by a volcano in Jakarta. Only the Thunderbirds have the incredible machines to carry out... I think it's time to send the emergency signal. I fear you are not wrong, m'lady. Lisa Lowe. Back to you, Chuck. I'm telling you, Fermat, it was like The Hood was inside my head back there. What do you mean, Alan? Maybe he can read minds or control minds or something. Don't be silly, Alan. Everything can be explained by science. I'm trying to figure out his weakness. Everybody has an Achilles' heel. Well my Achilles' heel is actually my Achilles' heel. It's got a blister the size of a basketball. Tintin! - Can we s-s-s... - Stop? - Yes. - No. Okay. No more cheeseburgers for you, Fermat. - Any word?À - Nothing, m'lady. Right, tell Lord Marlborough I've broken my shooting arm. We shall send the Institute of the Blind a dozen guide dogs. And bring the car around. Yes, m'lady. The Thunderbirds appear to be in a spot of trouble and I don't like that. Let's go, Parker. Ready for launch. We'll use this to get into the vaults. Subtle as usual, Mullion. Didn't realize we'd be getting points for style. We're robbing banks, remember? Don't worry, you'll get your money. Transom, initiate pre-flight diagnostics. What's going on? Guidance processor error. - It's the guidance processor. What's wrong with it? There isn't one. Clever Alan. - It's the children. À They have it. - No way. They're dead. No one could live through something like that. I did. Get them, Mullion. Take whatever you need. Make sure you get the guidance processor before you lose your temper. Alan, don't you think Tintin is blossoming? Blossoming?! What's that suppose to mean? Come on, Alan. You have a c-c... crush on her. You gotta be kidding. I mean she's... she's not that bad, I guess. Okay, guys, take five. Five isn't gonna do it. Guys? Don't move. What is it? Androctonus scorpion. Is that dangerous? .025 milligrams of its venom is fatal. So, "dangerous" is, in fact, an understatement. Watch out! - Tintin, what was that? - Let's get going. Hey! She has the same powers as her uncle, The Hood. - You think? - Must run in the family. Did you do that? - Just drop it, okay? Still think everything can be explained by science? Not girls. Whoa! - Scott, Gordon. À You all right? - We're okay. - The heat À exchanger's blown. - You don't say. Come on, those brats are in here somewhere. How are we doing, Fermat? Don't rush me, Alan. This is very delicate equipment. Which is now b-broken. - Can you fix it? - Y-y... maybe but, I'll need something to solder with. We're in the middle of nowhere, Fermat. We are you gonna find something like that? What? Ow! Perfect. Gee, Alan, I never would have figured you for a cry-baby. - I'm gonna kill you. - What did he say? I think it was some sort of apology. Hmm. That's... I got it, yes! You're the man, Fermat. Okay, the first step is to establish contact with Thunderbird 5. - Dad! - It's Alan. Dad! - Alan, where are you? À Are you safe? I'm at the relay station with Fermat and Tintin. Fermat's gonna hack into the main computer system and give control back to you. - We're standing by. - Okay, we're almost there. Goodness me, Professor. You're so good-looking without your glasses on. I think you may find that's another thing we have in common. Pretty? Unauthorized transmission. - Oh, now, that's not fair. Just when things were starting to sizzle. Unauthorized transmission. A burst of transmission from the island satellite station. - Should I jam it? - And give Mullion À the co-ordinates. Take the main track south east then head up Satellite Hill. They're on to us! We're being jammed! - Can you finish? - I'll try. - Alan, what's happening? - Hang in there, Dad. À One more minute! It's not going to work. The signal's too weak for data transmission. Can you hear me? They're jamming our signal. We're gonna lose you. Don't worry, I'll take care of everything. Negative. It's too dangerous. Follow emergency procedure. Wait for Lady Penelope at the rendezvous point. Can you read me? Alan! - Dad! - Alan, we're losing you! - Alan! Dad! - No! - Useless! - It is now. - I'm sorry, Alan. This is hard on all of us. No, it's okay. I'm fine. You don't have to be such a tough guy, Alan. I'm worried about my dad, too. I'd do anything to be with my parents right now. But The Hood knows we're alive now. We have to go. Even worse. They know exactly... Where we are! Come on! Great, more water! Tintin, can you slow them down? - I'd be delighted. - Then do it and meet us À at the junkyard. Come on, Fermat. This will get us outta here. There. Come on. Straight ahead. Ah! It's gonna make this thing hard to control. - Be careful not to exceed À four bars of boost or else... - I said no problem. - We gotta get out À of here. What's this? - It's a hoversled. It's our ticket out of here, unless you've got a better idea. - Let's wait for Lady Penelope À like your dad said. - Here. Great plan. Let's sit here and wait to get caught. I say we have to do something. Now. Right Fermat? Actually, I agree with Tintin. I don't think this is s-safe. You don't think anything is s-s-s-safe. Just because I s-s-stutter doesn't mean that I'm wrong. If we're a team, we should make decisions as a team. Do you guys want to sit here and take a vote or do you want to get out of here? 'Cause I'm going. You can be a real jerk sometimes. Go! Oh, no! Come on, faster! Alan, you're going to fast! I need more speed to get him by the trees. Hang on! What did I tell you guys? Oh, no. What are you doing? Oh, no, not the fridge. - Tintin! - Hey, son. - Sweetheart, are you okay? - I'm fine, Dad. Cool off, kid. Tracy Island approaching. Switching to aqua mode. Isn't life fun sometimes? Rib-tickling, m'lady. What is it? We have an unidentified craft approaching the island at high speed. Lady P. Whew, somebody roll down a window, it's getting a little hot in here. Re-entry into Earth's atmosphere in 37 minutes. - Oxygen's out in 30, À so we won't feel a thing. - Stop it! Come on, Dad. Situation's hopeless. No, there's still time. We've got people on the ground working for us. Alan? He's just a kid. He's a Tracy. - This doesn't look good. - No, m'lady. That bougainvillea is absolutely parched and someone should do something about that hideous hammock. Whom do we have here? Mullion! I must warn you that I know judo, krai magna, and tai kwan do. - And I know Parker. - M'lady. - You've broken my nose. - Yes, that was the intention À of the maneuver. - Whoa! - One tries so hard in life to sort things out on an intellectual slash conversational level, but sometimes it's just not possible. Ow! Oh! Shall I bring the car around, m'lady? Parker, have a bit of a lie down. Excuse me, m'lady. Ah. Lady Penelope. Of course. He has his palace, why not his princess? Flattery will get you nowhere. Ow! Have you any idea what a manicure costs these days? Ow! Boo! Coming through, m'lady! Duck, m'lady! He's weak. Using his power makes him weak. Whoa! You're a formidable opponent. More than a match for most men. That's not saying much, then, is it? I suggest you let us pass. Don't try your parlor games on me, you sad little man. You've committed a serious crime trespassing on this island and in about four seconds, I'm going to get quite cross with you. How are you, Alan? I hope you don't think I'm going to chase you. You can make it stop, Alan! You have something À that belongs to me. Really, sir, don't mind me. This isn't the first time I've been pulverized. And it's never did any real harm before. - Ow! - Stop, I'll give it to you. Fetch! You made a match of it. I'll give you that. Put them with the others. You're coming with me. Put me down! This outfit is couture. Don't go to sleep. John, look at me. Keep your eyes open. - You need to cool off, lady. - Lady Penelope. Big oaf! Right, that's quite enough losing for one day. How does it feel to be right all the time? Not bad, actually. I'm so sorry, Fermat. We make quite a pair. It's hard for me to t-t-talk. It's hard for you to l-l-listen. Parker, I have an idea. Excellent, m'lady. Brains, how long do Jeff and the boys have? I can't think. I'm too c-cold. Guidance processor installed. - The guidance processor À has been installed. - Engine sequence complete. Thunderbird 2 is ready for takeoff. Begin launch sequence. - What is our ETA? - Under an hour. Bank of London, here we come. Thunderbird 2 preparing for takeoff. We gotta be quick, The Hood's getting away. - In position, m'lady. - Here we go. Launch sequence, stage two. - Yes. - Good shot, m'lady. Come on, Parker. Let's give those bad guys a good trashing. Hydraulic systems green. Guidance systems green. Launch sequence, stage three. This seems to be a straight forward six lever mortise. - I love it when your checkered past comes in handy. - Thank you, m'lady. Unfortunately, I feel I shall need a piece of wire to access the mechanism. Will this suffice, Parker? Most certainly, m'lady. I didn't actually need it anyway. Of course not, m'lady. - Quick, they're getting away. - Okay, everyone get to À the control room. Hat? Get in there quick, Fermat. and save my family. Then we'll get The Hood. Good luck. Access to mainframe denied. Looks like they slipped a backdoor key into the access codes. - I'll follow your lead, son. - Thunderbird 5, come in. Thunderbird 5, come in. How long do they got before re-entry? 90 seconds, and counting. Access to mainframe confirmed. Okay, I just need someone on their end to confirm the access protocol. Thunderbird 5, come in. Dad, come on, are we coming through? Mr. Tracy, can you hear me? Come in. Thunderbird 5, come in. - Dad, come on! - Mr. Tracy, can you here me? À Come in. - Dad! - Thunderbird 5, come in. - How long do they got? - 45 seconds until re-entry. Damn it, Jeff, wake up! I think that's the first time you've ever called me by my first name, Brains. Thanks for waking me. - Dad. - Alan. Well done. Mr. Tracy? Confirm access protocol. Confirmed. We are back on-line. Gravity is restored. Put Thunderbird f-f... your craft into geostationary orbit immediately. - FAB, Brains. - Geostationary orbit re-established. Looks like we're good to go. - Dad, are you all right? - We're fine. We still have a job to do. Where's The Hood? He's in Thunderbird 2. He's headed for L-l-l... - London. - She's right. He's got them all on board. Looks like Thunderbird 3 lost a booster, Dad. We'll never get there on time. Let me go after The Hood. He'll destroy everything you've built, everything the Thunderbirds stand for. - Negative. - I'm sorry, it's too risky. - I can do this, you know I can. What am I saying? We can do this. Okay, Alan. We'll meet you there. - Thunderbirds are go! - fab. Okay, boys, we are outta here. - Are we really going? - Yep. Oh, boy. - Ready, Fermat? - N-n... I guess. Engine sequence activated. - Flight controls are green. - Anti-detection shield... - Hydraulic systems are good. activated. Set primary fuel pumps. Main engine start. Don't boys just love their toys? Engine sequence complete. Launch sequence initiated. Launch sequence complete. And off we go. Get the bridge up! Get the bridge up! Thunderbird 1, come in. - Roger, Brains. - Situation update. Thunderbird 3 is about to initiate separation. FAB. Boys, Thunderbird 2 is in final approach to London. I know The Hood's weakness, Fermat. I can stop him if we get there in time. Stand by. We're going to maximum thrust. Gordon, heat 'em up. We're getting reports of some kind of incident in London involving the Thunderbirds. Lisa, are you there? Chuck, I'm here in Jubilee Gardens where Thunderbird 2 has made an impromptu landing causing total panic in Central London. As far as we know, there's been no emergency call from this area. So it's unclear why Thunderbird 2 would be active here at all. I don't know if you can see this, but Thunderbird 2 seems to be unloading some kind of machine. Set a course for the vault. Sir, if we continue on our present course, we'll severe the monorail's subterranean supports. - Shall I correct our position? - Stay on course. But sir, we'll cause a major disaster. No we won't. The Thunderbirds will. - Get us down, boys. - Initiate landing, Fermat. - Right. - Three-point landing sequence initiated. Retros to 75. Flaps 16. Fab. Danger. Landing sequence error. - You're going too fast! - Thanks. Retros to 90. Textbook, boys. Activating electromagnetic pulse to disable the bank's security systems. ETA one minute. Parker, meet me at the Bank of London. Yes, m'lady. Let it out, boys! - The Hood's getting away. - Those people can't hold À on much longer. - What are you gonna do? - We're the Thunderbirds. Our duty is to save those people. Brains, we're going into the accident zone. FAB, Thunderbird 2 and good luck. Brains, the monorail is down! Repeat! The monorail is down! I'm going underwater in Thunderbird 4. Automatic pilot. You have the bridge. - Me? Fly alone? - Fermat, the Thunderbirds À need you right now. I need you. FAB, Alan. Manual control. Brains, come in. What's the situation? The Hood has caused major disaster with the vault. The mono-ma-mono... one track railway is down in the Themes. - Where's Thunderbird 1? - It's on the ground. The k-k-kids are in Thunderbird 2. FAB, we're right behind them. Look at all this gold! Stay focused. Nine more banks to go. Fermat, deploying Thunderbird 4 in three two... one. Thunderbird 4 is go. I can see the monorail. Mommy! Don't panic, guys. Extending magnetic claw. Fermat, I'll hold the monorail in place. Can you get a line on that stanchion and lift it? I can't get a clear fix on the target. I might hit the passengers. I'll go and fix it myself. - What, you mean swim? - Get me as close as you can. How we doing on that line, Fermat? Just look out your window. Come on, Tintin. Come on. Come on. Come on, Tintin. You can do this. Opening the airlock. Contact magnets activated. Okay, Fermat. We need a lift. FAB, Alan. Commencing reverse thrust. That was amazing, Tintin. Thank you. Nice job, Fermat. Nothing to it, really. Easy does it. There they are! Glad you could finally join us. Hey, don't get cocky after one mission. We still have a dangerous situation here. I need you boys to close down this accident scene. Tintin, go get Fermat. Meet us at Thunderbird 1. Alan, come with me. - Let's clean it up.À - We've got to get to À the Bank of London. Penelope went after the Hood. I know, she may need our help. Ashes to ashes, diamonds to diamonds. Lady Penelope. What an unpleasant surprise. Don't be rude. I can't tell you what a pleasure it would be to use my little finger to pull this big trigger. Now don't move! Mullion. - That's not cricket! - I'm sorry. The only part of the sport I ever liked was winning. How ghastly. Hey Dad. That stuff the Hood said, about you leaving him to die, - he was lying, right? - No. You see, you can't save everyone, Alan. It doesn't matter how hard you try, or how brave you are. It doesn't even matter if it's someone you love, someone you'd give up your life in a second to save. You just can't save everyone. What was Mom like? She was a lot like you. Come on, we've got a job to do. - Finish her off, Mullion. - Shame on you. I always despise a man who delegates the important jobs. Oh, dream on, sad act. - Good timing, Parker. - Good afternoon, À Mr. Tracy. - Come with us. - My pleasure, Mr. Tracy. The Thunderbirds. They're here. Kill them all. Alan, you guys stay here with Parker. - I'm gonna find Lady Penelope. - But what about The Hood? Look out, Parker! Master Tracy! - Look out, Parker! - All right, that's enough À of that. Don't move. Go on, then. - I'm sorry, I can't hit a lady. - Allow me. I've been waiting to get my hands on you little brats. And I've been waiting to get my hands on you. Now that was a punch. Parker, can we wrap this up? What did you have in mind, Master Hackenbacker? Strategically speaking, the best odds of success - lie with the Parker Haymaker. - I concur. Penny! Jeff, no! Did you save them all this time, Jeff? Or did you leave someone behind? I didn't make you what you are. It's not me you have to convince. - You leave my son À out of this. - Dad! Dad! Dad! I'm disappointed in you, Alan. I thought we were kindred spirits. Well, we're not. I'm Jeff Tracy's son. - Yes, you certainly are. - No! Alan, no! Alan! Come here, you little minx! Oh! Ah! Bye, bye. Alan, stay back. You want so desperately to walk in Daddy's footsteps. - Let him go. - Did you really think À you could challenge me? - Let him go, please! - Let him go! Please, let him go! PenelopeAlan! Alan, are you all right? Alan, get out, run! He's getting weaker. - He can't last much longer. - Neither can you! Alan, no! Look out! Alan! I'm glad you could be here to see this, Jeff. Goodbye, Alan. - No! - Oh. Ah. Oh. Leave me, Alan. Leave me to die. Like your father did. - I don't want À to save your life. - Aah! - But that's what we do. See you soon, Jeff. Now that was definitely showing off. - Get off me! - Settle, mate. À You calm down. - Gordon. - Nice catch. - Hey, Scott. - Get him. - Jeff, what did you put À in these margaritas? - A Tracy secret. That's my boy. One more week and you're gonna be swimming like a f-f... do-do-do... sha-sha-sha... aquatic creature. - Good job, Ferm. - Thanks. - So what do you think? - He's getting there. Whoa, Tintin. Ah, you just really... - Blossoming. - Ew! - Did you say blossoming? Gather round, everybody. I have an announcement to make. Tonight is a special night. We're all together, because of three very special people: Fermat, Tintin, Alan. The world needs Thunderbirds. And the Thunderbirds need you. - Mr. Tracy. - Thank you, sir. Congratulations, Alan. No shortcuts. You earned it. You all did. I'm not usually an emotional man, but sometimes even the toughest nut must crack. - Hey, way to go, sprout. - That's my boy, Alan. Yes, Madam President. I see. Of course. Straightaway. Boys! Sorry, Penny. Duty calls. Of course it does. And quite right, too. Thunderbirds are go! Fast as you can, Parker.
