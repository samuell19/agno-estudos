Chile's government is coming under extreme pressure as violent street protests show no sign of abating. Protesters are clashing with police in many areas of the capital Santiago. The protest widened into a mass movement against inequality. Violence of the state police against the protesters at such a level that the United Nations is raising concerns. When you fucking lie to the young people you'll find our answer on the streets. We're just really tired, but not tired of being on the streets in protest, we're just tired of these lies, this constant lying. Young people put their feet forward as they walked in protest against climate change. I just feel like doing it because it's not so often in Uganda that people of my age stand up and demand what they want. In Hong Kong the occasion was marked with riot police and tear gas protesters took their anti-government demonstration to the city's shopping centres. Calling for democratic reforms and demanding the city maintain its autonomy. I don't think I can return to my old life anymore. Like since it started, you took up the responsibilities, then you can't really go back. Traditional filled churros! Very hot! It's weird, because I do feel connected to my hometown, and I will definitely say that Santiago is my hometown, but just imagining raising my future children here is weird, because I really don't want to expose my children to so many problems that we have here at the moment. I really want them to have more opportunities than I had. Hello! How are you doing? Good and you? - Good, because you're my friend. And because I'm buying a drink. - Good. The socialist parties are already at the square, right? Yes, right there, where I live! It's where I live. You, the youth, need to really see… You the young ones are who need to see what's really happening, because the old people are now past it. It's true. The old ones won't change. - No, they won't. They won't, that's true. So, that's it... Yes it's true, thank you! Bye bye! - Stay safe! See you! - You're the ones who have to change the world! Yes! The world! That's right! See you, stay safe! I like my neighbourhood because I can see like a lot of different cultures, Venezuelan people, Colombian and I really like that. When I went to school, I never saw my parents, because they were just always working, so my grandmother raised me, who is also still working, even though she's 70 years, because the pensions are just so low and the cost of living is so high that you just can't live if you're not working. Chile is seen as one of the richest countries in Latin America, but we, the working class, don't get anything from that. We're the only country in the world where water is privatised, privatised education, privatised healthcare, and pension systems still mainly favour the wealthy. We have a huge inequality gap, fucking low wages, fucking low pensions and the cost of living gets higher and higher. But the biggest problem is our constitution, which is the main reason for failing healthcare, terrible pensions, and the big gap in our society. It was developed under Pinochet, a brutal dictator. We ask ourselves how can that be still in our law? All these graffitis tell stories and show things that are real, that happen, that you can't forget. This is a really powerful photo because... it's where it all began. Where it all start to happen, with this, like, to make noise and the ladies just doing this with the pan, the wooden spoon, it's really meaningful to us, it is. I remember that day really clearly because it was Friday, October 18 and the government raised the prices for the metro again, so the working class and the poor people have to pay more for their everyday lives again. After decades of inequality that was just enough. People got really angry and called on everyone not to pay for the tickets anymore. I remember that I was on the bus and I looked on the street and saw like, wow, there's something going on here and it's different. And I remember that we get like really close to my house and in one street there were just so many people doing this. And now the people rise up in the fight with the voice of a giant, shouting: "forward!" The united people will never be defeated, the united people... And all my friends and I, we realised that that was only the beginning. Joshua give me some. Please, Joshua. No, I want Joshua to give me some. Look, Joshua has given me one. Being around my family gives me so much hope, especially in those moments when I am feeling down, they give me this motivation, because I don't want them to pass through the same experience I passed through when I was growing up. So they keep me motivated. One two three and go! One two three and go! Don't step on that stone! One two three and go! I grew up in Wakiso district in a small town called Kyengera. I spent most of my childhood with my father. I didn't spend so much time with my mother when I was still young. Hilda was a very vibrant kid who did everything very fast. She always wanted me to bring her something whenever I went to work. Sweets or something similar. She loved such snacks. Whenever I was leaving, she was like: "Mummy, give me some money for sweets." So people even nicknamed her "Sweetie". My parents had a plantation where we used to rear cows or other animals like goats, pigs, chicken, very huge plantations, and back then they used to be farmers… But due to the effects of climate change, all the crops dried out due to no rainfall. Sometimes there was heavy rainfall that washed away all the crops and also the rising temperatures that dried out all the streams and wells where we used to collect the water to feed the livestock. My parents had to sell all the land we had so they could get money to gather for our food, our survival, our fees. It gets worse and worse every year. Hundreds of people died because of these same floodings. Too many families lost their homes, and mine is one of them. I remember a time when I had to miss my school because my parents were out of money and I had to sit home for four months. It was really very bad and from then, I thought I could do something to change this whole situation. By that time I didn't know that the effects we were facing were because of climate change. Uganda's past was precious. Those who were there before could call it the pearl of Africa but I don't think they could come back right now and call it the same again. 98.0 UBC radio - Inspiring Uganda. It is a lovely afternoon right here in studio and yet also another wonderful day where we discuss issues that affect the youth in Uganda. Here on the program "Young and Smart". My name is Laureen and today in studio we have the team from Fridays for Future Uganda. Hello, welcome - Thank you. It's so cold! My name is Nakaybuye Hilda Flavia, I'm a climate activist and I'm a student at Kampala International University. I'm 22 years old and I pursue a bachelor's degree in procurement and supply chain management. So why climate? You could have maybe gotten another passion maybe about the girl-child, or something, or, you know, sexual harassment. Why climate? I chose climate because it is something that affects each and every one of us. When you look at maybe the girl-child or violation it looks at only one gender and in the world we have two genders. So climate change affects each and every one of us, no matter the age, no matter the size, no matter the gender, no matter the status, so it is something that is connected to us. I'll also ask a question: What do you want the youth to know about Fridays for Change? What can you tell them that can convince them? My message to the youth… I'll first of all begin with a question: To all the youth who are listening to me right now, I just want to pose one question to you. Why would you study for a future that is not clear? But we have still not achieved a single thing. We still have not gotten any of the five demands. Hong Kongers add oil! - Add oil! Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times! - Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times! - Liberate Hong Kong! I'm born and raised in Hong Kong and I grew up on the Kowloon side. I'd say that my hometown it's really homey. I always feel connected to Hong Kong, because I've been here for my whole life. I have all my friends around me and my parents are all in Hong Kong. So, I don't really have some other places that I could call home. There are lots of people standing in the back. I just want to ask one thing... Are Hong Kongers united in this demonstration? Yes! It pains my heart whenever I think about it... It keeps me awake at night. Why are these young people taking bullets for us? A lot of you asked why I'm volunteering as a first-aider. I said, without a doubt, I owe it to today's youngsters. Five years ago, what did we achieve during the Umbrella Movement? Nothing. Nothing at all. Since 1997, we've been witnessing our society being gradually destroyed. Did we try to do anything? No, we didn't. As an adult, I feel sorry and ashamed. Ask your heart! Aren't you ashamed? Seeing all these teenagers being beaten up... how do you feel? Aren't you heartbroken? Yes! They are standing up for us. When you see them, say 'thank you', give them a hug or a handshake. These gestures will always be appreciated. Thanks everyone! Hongkongers! - Add oil! Hongkongers! - Add oil! Seeing the activists around me make me realise that there's still hope in this city, because the major thing of a city is the space and people. Without these two elements you can't have a city, and people are really united till now, three months later. It kills my thought when thinking about moving out from Hong Kong or going somewhere else, because I can feel the linkage between me and Hong Kong right now. Success is definitely important in a protest and a movement, but I think the love and care you have towards your hometown is way more important than success. Now Hong Kong people are to run Hong Kong. That is the promise and that is the unshakable destiny. A long time ago my hometown Hong Kong was handed back by the British to China in 1997, under the premise of one country, two systems. We all were raised with democratic values, with freedom of speech, with freedom of press, but in the recent years, China is trying everything to make Hong Kong just like another Chinese city. "PUBLIC TRANSPORT HAS BETRAYED HONGKONGERS" A dictatorship with their own propaganda and great firewall like it's done in China has nothing to do with our values. So this is the most important thing for us, because we don't want dictatorship. I mean that was a promise to us. They may think that we belong to them, that they possess us, but I'm not from China, I'm from Hong Kong. Retract! Retract! I first started to protest on the 9th of June, because the 12th of June was supposed to be the day that our chief executive, Carrie Lam, was going to push the extradition law to China, which actually minimised our independency in Hong Kong. "Withdraw the bill" "CARRIE LAM STEP DOWN" Do you, as Hong Kong's leader, have the autonomy to decide to withdraw the bill? Yes or no? Or is this something that Beijing has to approve as well? Well, actually this question has been answered on previous occasions. But you've evaded the question on numerous occasions. Number one, as we have all heard from the spokesman of the Hong Kong and Macau affairs office, the central government is still confident that I myself as the government of the Hong Kong SAR, together with the police force, that we are still capable of resolving this crisis. So the first question is answered. - Do you have the autonomy or not… to withdraw the extradition bill, please? - The second point I want to make... Could you answer that specific question? - …is in response to the various demands that we have heard. We have considered all factors and came up with a response that we have rehearsed time and again over the last two months. Thank you very much. - Do you have the autonomy or not to withdraw the extradition bill? She has answered your question. You have not answered the question, you've evaded the question. Thousands of people have just wrapped up a rally in central Hong Kong for the fight against a controversial extradition bill. Those amendments could have allowed Beijing to spirit Hong Kongers to mainland China for any accused crimes, even those that might be made up. Critics worry that the bill would make it easier for Beijing to exert control over the region. You're looking at live pictures from Hong Kong. They are demonstrating against a proposed law allowing extradition to mainland China. The situation we know turned violent this afternoon as clashes erupted between police and protesters. I have seen people getting injured or getting caught and getting arrested. It just always reminds me to be more careful and more alert. For me I do worry about being arrested but not in a sense of like "oh I have to be in jail for how many years and I lost my freedom." It's not about that, it's mainly now about how the police would beat you up in that 48 hours that they're legally to detain you, that's actually the part that scares me a lot. I'm going to have nightmares about the military, and cops and all that. It's been a while since I've had a dream with them, but the other day I had a weird dream, almost like a zombie apocalypse, but at the end there was military. I was like, I prefer zombies... Like, if I went into a place and there was military, I'd say, no, I prefer zombies rather than military. It scares me, I run very slow. If someday I have to run, I won't be able to, I'm really slow. The people, the people... People, where are you? We're in the street, for our dignity! I think you can't simply ignore the young people and the working class. That will backfire at some point. You ignore the working class, you will have a whole city on the streets. On October 25th of 2019, there was a huge protest in Santiago, with 1.2 million people. We pushed for social reforms and a more equal society. We thought our voices will be heard. Instead of doing anything that could have improved the situation of the working class, our billionaire president announced that Chile is at war, essentially against its own citizens. We are at war! Against an implacable powerful enemy that respects nothing and no one, that is willing to use violence and crime without any limits, even when it means loss of human lives, that is willing to burn our hospitals, our subway stations and supermarkets, with the only purpose of causing the greatest possible damage, to all Chileans. They're at war against all Chileans of goodwill, who want to live in democracy, freedom and peace. We're all scared, we're all scared that the police may arrest us one day, and especially me, I'm very scared that they will know my name, my address and who my family and friends are. So it's a big deal to keep it secret. Most of my friends and some of my family members, they don't know my role on the frontline, and I think it's better for them not to know it… But still it feels, it feels I'm lying to them. For example, in my phone contacts I made a special note for everyone who knows that I'm on the frontline. Back in the time when I was studying in the UK, my housemates forced me watching so many James Bond films, so I put J.B. in front of every name of those people who know that I'm on the frontline. I also have a Google calendar managing my second life, so I can help myself remembering the lies that I made and not to make mistakes. Living this double life, it's really tiring. I don't want to lie to my friends that much, but I have no choice, and I don't want it to be like that forever. There's a lot of plastic and polythene, it's just like a floating river of plastic. It hurts so much to see that what we call beauty or nature is turning out to be something evil, something that is going to kill us soon. But some people do not really care. We come out as people to clean it and still some people will still throw plastic even when you're cleaning it. Have you ever seen anything like this before? Not in Uganda. Not in Uganda? Well here it is now, in your backyard. This used to be a very, very good river, and if you talk to some people who used to be neighbours here, we used to come even and swim. The young children used to come here and swim. As we in school swam, next to the river, we used to have culture songs that we'd sing for the river, our beautiful river. And I still know that song and I love it so so much. But as we grew up... Do you understand when you take things for granted? Slowly but surely this river started disappearing. What takes up most of my time in this movement is creating massive climate awareness because climate change is not taught in school so people don't get it when we first talk to them about climate change. So we need rounds and rounds of discussions about it for them to get it. Especially the elders feel that they have lived their life and the rest is for us, the coming generation, to do. I also moved to my class where I study from, and I had a conversation with my professor, and when I talked about climate change he really gave me a negative attitude and told me climate change does not exist. And he told me climate change is God's plan and there is nothing I can do about it. It's about the environment. Listen to this young lady here! If you compare the things she's doing and what you're doing, there's a big difference. She also loves the people. Look, a young woman has to come to clean River Mpanga for you. How do you feel? Good? You lose nothing in cleaning where you are. So I'm asking you to do what's best for the environment. If you preserve this river, your children and grandchildren will still find it here in the future. Sadrach! Do you know that beneath all this grass is plastic? Whenever you pull something up, all you see is bottles underneath. Thousands of them. My biggest fears are if government, and corporate organisations and individuals do not act towards creating solutions to this climate crisis, I fear that the future I'm working for right now, will not be there, because of inaction. By positively speaking, I would say that every time, even we're like weak and then we're on the losing side, but it's always a chance for us to improve the next time; it's always a chance for us to learn what to do better, or what we could have used better next time, what kind of equipment we could have. I would say the worst thing to be on the losing side is that every time you being on the frontline you seeing people getting arrested and then going home that night, you feel like "why it's not me?", or "why I didn't do anything to fight back to the police so I could actually have a chance to save that person from the police hand?" That is a really hard part. When they are actually really close to you, you feel scared, but at the same time you have to make the decision "oh I could have a chance to save that person. I could have a chance to not run away and maybe grab that person's hand, then we could have run together and I could have saved him from being arrested". So there's never right or wrong, because it's a human instinct that you protect yourself, but you also feel really guilty if you know that you may have a 1% chance to save that person, even though you don't know that person. What I like about Hong Kong and the protests here is that many young people are so innovative and they use their skills to serve the protests and improve the situation for the people here. During the entire protest everyone keeps saying "be water" and, as a mapper, I can't direct people and tell them go here go there, but I can tell them where it's safe to go and I think that's the most important for everyone right now, especially as civilians may very easily be caught up in conflict areas, because you never know where it's going to be, so we hope that the map can provide information for people who wish to stay safe. There was one day when all the protesters were rounded up in New Town Plaza in Sha Tin. They were directed into the MTR station, into the mall by the police, basically they kettled all the protesters in the Sha Tin and then they just started rounding them up and beating them up. We were just wondering like, how could this have happened? Why is there nowhere to go? Even for people who wanted to escape, who wanted to avoid conflict. So then we decided to draw a map so we could see where the police are, where protesters are, to make sure that people at least have an escape route. It updates real-time so people will know where the police are stationed, where there are a lot of protesters, where there are roadblocks, even how the transport situation is like. So this is information that would be useful for the general public, but would also be useful for people on the frontlines, if they want to know escape routes, if they want to know basically where police are, where it's not safe, where they should not go. Apart from that we've also got some feedback from the first aid teams. They're really grateful that we write down where protesters are, especially we also indicate the density of protesters in different areas so that they know where they should set up their first aid stations, supply stations, rest stations and all that. Fresh beer! Stay calm! Just protect yourself! What? Just protect yourself! I have a helmet. Some friends at work ask me: "Don't you have any fear of being at the frontline?" And I'm just like no, I like to be on there, because you change this fear into something else. Look, another one! The police at the protests are supposed to be there to protect us, but they do the opposite. They use all their power against us. When they shoot us, they shoot us right on the face. When they throw us water with this water cannon, they don't care what happens to us. They don't care if we get burned because of their toxic water. They don't care if they run over us with their trucks. They drop gas bombs which hurts in the eyes, it hurts you everywhere. They look like saints, like they don't do anything. This is what's happening here in Chile! Fuck you, Piñera! Wise up! I never saw a person die on the Dignity Square, but I was near when Abel Acuña died. Space! We need some space here! He can't breathe! He can't breathe, motherfucker! Stop throwing tear gas, motherfuckers! Motherfuckers! Here's the ambulance! The ambulance! Put him on the stretcher! Piece of shit! Somebody's dying here, motherfucker! Let's go! Let's go! Motherfucker! Asshole! Go fuck yourself! Go die, motherfucker! Go die! On Monday, the attorney's office will receive the medical report about the cause of Abel Acuña's death. The 22nd victim since the protests started, who died after suffering a respiratory arrest at Plaza Italia. Also a first aider was injured, she was hit by a bullet... And so it's even worse, on the one hand, first aiders complain they can't do their job and there are first aiders who were affected directly by the way the police acted! This is very serious! We think this situation must not happen again! Come in! - Thank you. May I? Excuse me. Hello. Excuse me. I want to show you photos of him as a little boy. You have photos of him as a kid? Just when he was a little boy... The typical dance they make you do in school. That was when he was little, here he's a little older. Ah, there you are. Is that your other son? - Yes, Elías. And there he is more of a teenager? - Yeah, like 13, 14 years... We always took pictures of him. Pass her the bread. No. I'm fine, I'll just have some tea, don't worry. No, no way, eat. Eat a piece of bread. - All right, I will. Thank you. That's a trick used by women. - What is? All of them. - To say no? Yes. "Take some food." "No, thanks, but since you insist so much..." - I see, well ok. And later... - That's true, later I'd be hungry anyway. Thanks. Yesterday, I saw a video that a girl found on her phone, and you see the police illegally taking two children who've since been in prison for two months. They planted evidence on them, said they had Molotovs, were hooded... And in the video you see they're 2 children, not even hooded, they check their backpacks, and find nothing. Then they say they had Molotovs, were hooded, breaking things, etc. They've been in prison for two months for being in a protest. Because you're exposed to everything there, unfortunately, and more every day, because when we started to realize what was happening, we were at the start, you know? But instead of it reducing... It's only been worse. - It's only been worse. And the problem is the damage doesn't go away, it's permanent. Exactly, I mean, I don't know... like I'm really ashamed, but I can't even imagine how that must feel... really... And it was the third Friday, he didn't go every day, it was the third Friday he went, and he went with two colleagues. And I was like: "No, you're not going!" "Mommy," he'd say, "I'll just go for a little while". He'd leave work at 6:30 pm and arrive at 7 pm. He'd return at 8 pm before things got bad. Yes, the day gets dark and the cops go crazy. Then I called him and said: "Come home, Abel." "Yes, Mommy, I'm leaving now." It's disgraceful. What kills me most is that the doctor at the Posta Central hospital told us that if they'd let the ambulance proceed, he wouldn't have died. The ambulance they sent was the most advanced, with the best equipment... You could see the videos of the ambulance being there… They wet all the equipment so it didn't work. They couldn't attend to him in those conditions. The doctor told me he shouldn't have died. He said: "With the ambulance we sent, he shouldn't have died." And there were all these first aiders helping and they even shot at them. Yes, they shot at them too. And the impotence is so great that it's really like... how? Yes. That's why, when I'm there, I know my parents are worried and everything, but I'm also there for them, I mean, they struggled their whole life... Every Chilean family is in the same boat. I tell you, when they killed him, they killed half of my life. I can imagine. And the other part is for my other son, but if not, I don't know... I can imagine, because it's an overwhelming pain. No, my mom says so to me, so I can imagine that, because... That picture kills me. He looks so handsome. Many of them just risked their lives to serve the protest. And seeing all these dead people makes me feel really sad, because there is no responsibility at all. No one is taking responsibility for all these deaths. There is no justice, so that makes me feel even more angry. I really don't want to be the next face on this wall. Liberate Hong Kong! - Revolution of our times! Liberate Hong Kong! - Revolution of our times! Five demands! - Not one less! Five demands! - Not one less! I would say to be on the frontline you have to be really clear-minded, you have to be calm, at the same time you have to stay alert. You have to verify things with your eyes, not by just trusting what people saying around. Also, you have to be prepared to be arrested anytime, or you have to be prepared that you're gonna get hurt. Apart from the protest, I've been through a lot in this past three months. I had this boyfriend that I really liked. We broke up. I think if the protests had never happened or I never think it's a responsibility of myself, then we would have been still together. I'd say it's more sad if we actually fight for nothing at the end. I always say one thing, it's like, if you started to protest, being in a movement or like the situation now, all this kind of relationship stuff, you can just like leave it, and then you can just focus on the society, which is more important than everything. I never cry in the protest, or I never cry on the field. Sometimes I'd cry after I went home, after I saw some news, but that day when I got beat up, when I feel like I could actually get arrested, there was like thirty seconds to one minute that I felt like I couldn't do that anymore. All I was thinking is "Probably this is the last time that I could like freely out there protesting." My confidence for pushing grew up because very many people tell me that I inspire them, and this keeps me pushing, because I fear to fail. I fear that if I stop then I won't have done anything. I could just have left it just like other people do. But since I stood up in the first place, I should be strong enough to stand up until the end. Sometimes I ask myself if I am the right person to lead the movement, and sometimes I feel that maybe someone should be doing what I am doing right now, because I had to change my life in order to support my activism. I also lost some friends along the way, because I didn't have so much time with them. I feel like I'm not spending enough time with my parents and I wish I could spend more time with them, but... events abroad always create a conflict in me. This morning I received an invitation to a world climate conference in Copenhagen. That's massive for me. I don't really realize it yet, but I feel like that can really change my life. Activism needs a lot of commitment and sacrifices, but I'm just wondering if it will ever pay out. If people will really listen to me. But at the same time, this invitation is creating big conflicts in me. Traveling abroad is unusual for me and I won't be able to see my family for a very long time. It's not easy for me. I was surprised she could pull off something like that without any help, almost like she's now the one teaching me how it's supposed to be. So I'm very proud that Hilda is heavily involved in things like that, which can benefit the country at large. So what you're doing is good. But my worry is... That they'll kill us? That they'll kill us. I was also worried about people who invite you to different countries. Yes, you fear I may go missing. That I don't know the people who invite you. I wonder, how did they even get to know you? Being at the frontline means a lot of risks. Many people lost their eyes by the hands of the police, they just shoot rubber bullets directly on their faces. I always hope this doesn't happen to me. It's a very special thing about our protests that all of the 400 people lost their eyes here on Plaza Dignidad, on Dignity Square. It's a place filled with blood and it also divides Santiago. It's the border between the rich and the poor Santiago, and I think that it's symbolic for the split in our country. This lady still has the bullet in her eye, it's really, really powerful to see. She obviously lost her eye. What I fear the most about the protests you can see here. More than 400 people got shot in their faces by rubber bullets and lost one of their eyes. We always say "Dignity here costs one eye". Did you know Abel? No, but I attended his funeral. But it was formal, very sombre. I hid my tears. I'd never seen... That same Friday that Abel died I was going to meet with my dad, because my dad is always there too. I inherited my protesting spirit from him. And we were going to meet. I remember he called me an hour later than we'd planned. What day? - The day Abel died. And he told me "I got shot". The cop fired the shot so close to him that the pellets penetrated his thigh muscle. How is he? Is it infected? They're very deep and like a ball, like when they're encapsulated. Oh, that's awful. And the body starts to reject it. Yes. They told him he has to wait a little longer until the body rejects it even more and then they'll do the surgery. The surgery's going to be handled by the guys from 'The Chile' who are operating for free. I see. And it's kind of secret? - Sort of. Yeah, it really happens... Yeah, actually he has to go somewhere like Lo Prado. The public health system isn't treating us as they should. There's a criminalization of the victim. When I was admitted, I won't forget, the woman said: "What to you?" I said: "A pellet, fired by the police." "Are you sure? How do you know?" Are you kidding?! I need urgent assistance, my eye's bleeding, and they start questioning me. "What's wrong with you?" I said "What, shall I bring 7 witnesses? I have 8 if you want." And then she goes quiet, like: "Oh, I see." Imagine that! This is a tear gas canister, that they're throwing at us. It's what they use most. The first 200 blind people were injured with these. When this happened to me, and I suffered police aggression, I questioned myself a lot. I thought, maybe I was exposing myself, and then no, not at all. I was just passing by. There were no protests, it was New Year. My only mistake was to pass in front of them with my camera. Thinking they'd be calm. I trusted them and now look at this... It's horrible. The C40 World Mayors Summit is taking place in Copenhagen. They'll also discuss the next steps in tackling the effects of climate change. Prominent politicians will be joined by young activists from all over the globe. I'm a bit lost about what I really have to say. Is there anything that you want to say? Like from your whole experience so far here at the summit, like, that you would like to tell the world? Yes. What would you like to tell the world? Um… a lot. What sort of thing are you feeling strongly about? I think we've shared more what we demand and we haven't shared more what our inspirations are or what we really face in our communities. So I think it can be a way of how to inspire people into action, but not directly pushing them, but changing their mindset into it. I think that would be really powerful. I think it's important that it's for you as well, what is it that you want to say? I feel like I've over-talked and we've over-talked about what is happening and I feel like we should just act and just stop talking, because... always after giving these speeches and people say like "Oh you inspire us, you inspire us," like, inspirations, inspirations every time, and it feels like business as usual. Yeah, inspirations and then you go back home and then in your bed, oh you still hesitate still, you don't do anything about this inspiration thing. And I feel today it should be different, I should talk about me. Our flags are waving in the wind With the glorious praise of victory Ode to our gracious motherland Marching towards prosperity from today Ode to our gracious motherland Marching towards prosperity from today China forever! Of course we begin with that breaking news in Beijing where China's parliament has reportedly passed a controversial national security law for Hong Kong. Critics fear it will give Beijing more control over the semi-autonomous territory. Hong Kong's new security law is in full force with arrests and a very heavy police presence on the ground. It doesn't just affect Hong Kongers, it actually affects every single person around the world. So, if you've said anything bad about China and Hong Kong, through the lens of this national security law, you could be committing a crime. For a lot of people in Hong Kong, this is considered a pretty dark day. The Hong Kong security law was developed secretly in China. It forces the protests to end and makes every sign of resistance illegal. I don't go out, or I don't see anyone anymore, because I want to stay normal and unsuspicious. I'm always scared. I'm very scared that some people maybe there following me or they're watching me. One of my best friends, her nickname was "Black Water". She was always with me at the protests. She was very brave and she always protect me. We had dinner, we talked about the news and the security law. She told me that she's very concerned about it, and she looked so tired and she told me that she couldn't sleep. And the next day she got arrested. I've never felt so powerless. It hit me really hard, especially because... I can't see her anymore. I can't talk to her anymore. Not today, not tomorrow, not next week, next month but it is not for next ten years. When a really close friend texted me right after Beijing passed the law and was like, "Okay that's it. Everything that we did, it doesn't matter now". And two days later, she killed herself. I don't know what will happen next. Maybe I didn't work hard enough, or we didn't find the right way to express our demands, but at the same time I just don't know if there is any other way that we can stop them. My belief in what we're fighting for at the moment, it hasn´t break down, but… I think my fear is bigger than my belief right now. I think fear is their biggest weapon against us. Sometimes, I think that should I just give up? I mean I was in the fight for so long and invested everything, I sometimes wonder, is it better to just accepting the dictatorship, maybe the fear then goes away. Maybe then I can sleep good again, when I just stop caring about my city. Oh, policeman, what a life you chose slaughtering people is your calling Killing poor people is your profession and you give protection to the rich folks Say it! You will see the bullets you shoot at us will return You will see the bullets you shoot at us will return You will see the bullets you shoot at us will return. The most important I guess is this one. I had it with my father, he has it on his chest and I guess like the meaning of this is our entire relation. We still feel this way. "Together We Stand Divided We Fall" I'm very, very grateful for my dad that he enabled me to go to university and live the life that I'm living right now. Just thinking about losing him was the most horrible moment in my life. He made me the woman that I am today. I spent the whole night preparing my speech and now I feel like I can't wait to share it with people. I'm a bit anxious about what they'll think about it or after I've said it, but I'm also hopeful that they will act and it will open their minds to action. Thank you. I am Hilda and I am the founder of Fridays for Future in Uganda. I am missing my classes right now, same way I have missed them for the last six weeks to create climate awareness. It's not surprise because I once missed 3 months of school due to the effects of climate change we experienced in my family and community, and my father wasn't able to raise my tuition fees. I am a victim of this whole climate crisis and I'm not ashamed to say so. After the massive effects of climate change in my home village, the heavy rains, the strong winds that washed away our crops leaving the land bare, the constant dry spells that left the streams dry, my parents had to sell off our land and livestock to sustain our lives, and when the money was over, it was a question of survival and death. I am lucky that I am still surviving and I will... Go on. I am lucky that I am still surviving and I will not take this chance for granted, because people are dying every day. I made a decision to protect the only place I call Earth and by this I joined fellow young activists all over the globe to protect our future. Through endless fights, sacrifices, we hustle our way because this is our future. I will tell you that we are a generation of scared people, but very ambitious, very united, very persistent, and very good at action. Your beds might be comfortable right now, but not for long. You will soon feel the same heat we feel every day. Be rest assured that youth from the other side of the world, fighting for a safe future for you and for us all and are not about to give up yet. Let's move away from this summit with action. I thank you all. Hilda. You made me cry. You made me cry. I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed that we weren't able to stand against the ones who are bullying us. It doesn't really matter if we're smart and innovative, taking it to the streets so often, sharing our demands with the world, now, at the end, we're still alone. Everything we've done, it's for nothing. What I learned about activism is that it affects every part of my life. It's about sleepless nights, many sacrifices and struggles, because only very few people are willing to listen, and it really takes a lot not to give up. The last years changed my life. I don't really know yet if it was worth it, but I'll do everything to make sure that it will be. Remembering all the fights, all the injured, all the sacrifices people made, it really gives me energy. It's burning in me. I'll do anything for a better future. I owe this to my father, I owe this to my future children. We already lost so many battles, we can't risk losing this one. We don't risk our future by protesting on the streets. Not going on the streets and not raising our voices will risk our future way more. It's our generation who can change the course of history.
