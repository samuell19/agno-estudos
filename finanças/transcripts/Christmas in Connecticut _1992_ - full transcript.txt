'Speak.' 'Jeff, it's Linda.' 'Jefferson, I know you're there.' 'Okay, you sit, I'll talk.' 'Jerry and I were wondering if you'll come down to Denver' 'for Thanksgiving.' 'And you can't use last year's excuse.' 'You're not the only ranger in Colorado.' 'Oh, um, one last thing' 'would you please look for that Elizabeth Blane cookbook' 'that I gave you for your birthday?' 'Bring it, okay? You may not need it, but I do.' 'Thanks. Call us.' 'Oh, did I mention this is your sister Linda?' 'In the last hour experts predict this should be' 'the biggest storm to hit the Rockies in the last decade.' 'More than four feet of snow is anticipated' 'to blanket the area in the next 48 hours.' - 'Speak.' - 'Jeff, it's Captain Marsh.' 'From the base station. Are you there?' 'Some kids wandered off from his cabin.' 'It's about a half a mile from your place.' 'His parents are very upset.' Obviously. 'I'm glad you're there.' 'Do you mind taking a look around' 'before the storm kicks up?' How long has the kid been gone? 'Six hours.' Six hours? 'Yeah, a long time.' I'm on my way. 'Okay? You get a big opener.' 'You just.. All the way around.' 'Then you pour it in here and you pretend like' 'you're a cook, it's terrific.' Children just love watching you work, you know? Last night, my grandson, he's seven years old we had the most wonderful evening. We prepared dinner for the entire family. We had such a wonderful time. I wanna-I wanna look at these potatoes now see how they look. Oh, look at that. Look at my potatoes. Aren't they beautiful? I'm gonna teach you the secret ingredient right now. What you do, before serving these.. ...is you take some fresh mint.. some parsley, some olive oil, okay? You grind yourself up a beautiful mint pesto. - We... - 'Cut!' What are you talking about? I thought we went through this three months ago. - What? - No more pesto. Well, what should we call it? That's what it is. I don't care what it is. Don't call it pesto. Alright, what would I call mint and.. - What is it, Josie? - Olive oil. Olive oil. What would I call that? Anything but pesto. Pesto is passe. Pesto is passe? That's the kind of, uh, concept that keeps Oprah ahead of us in the ratings. - Oprah never thinks pesto. - What does she think? She thinks puree. - Puree? - Puree. Puree is timeless. - It's traditional, you know? - Yeah. And tradition is very big right now. Hey, I want that snow to be a little more emotional. - Hon, could you raise.. - You're not shaking it enough. Would you put your head down? Alright, you guys, clear out. - Let's go! - Alright? Time. - Is the tie okay? - You are a goddess. Oh. Thank you very much. - Too much lipstick? Alright. - 'Alright, everybody, action.' So now, just before serving your potatoes you toss them with a little mint puree. My husband just loves mint. He grows it in our garden. It tastes so good and it smells so nice too. 'Isn't that pretty?' 'Alright, we're gonna set that aside' because we're gonna move on to our piece de resistance. Thanksgiving turkey. Yeah, will you work on that turkey, please? - 'I love smoking our turkey.' - Yeah, put a little more color. Yeah. Yeah, make it shiny. Right. You see, everyone isn't as lucky as me to have your son-in-law build you your very own smokehouse but don't you worry about that because you can recreate that smoky flavor by adding these soaked hickory chips just like that. 'Now when we come back' 'we're gonna see how that all turned out.' Cut. Perfect! Turkey in! Turkey out! Let's go, everybody. This is show time! - You were double delicious. - Was it okay? - You were magnificent. - I was? Thank you. Who is this guy? I've never seen him before. Get out of here. Now, let's go. 'Too much snow. Calm it down.' 'Alright, everybody, out!' Let's go. This is show time. Get them out. Out, out. Action. Alright, here we are, four hours later. Let's see how our turkey looks. Oh, those hickory chips sure pack a wallop, don't they? But I think.. I think we can get.. Look at our bird! Our bird looks so beautiful. All brown and crunchy on the outside and juicy and moist on the inside after hours and hours of basting. Well, I just hope your family enjoys it as much as mine. So, from all of mine to all of yours good health, good eating, goodbye and Happy Thanksgiving! Cut! What a great show! Elizabeth, you were magnificent. - Aw, thank you. - Oh, so, and that turkey. What a beautiful turkey! You were all great. Okay, on to 149. Did somebody's cat die? Let's go, everybody. Nobody's going anywhere but me. I'm going home. First of all, I wanna thank you all. Each and every one of you. You're the best crew I've ever worked with. - Go home. Be with your family. - Who's the boss around here? Happy Thanksgiving! Oh, boy. Hiya, Mike. Are you okay today? ...six days of finding the ranger and the little boy. Here at the hospital, we spoke to two medical experts, both of whom feel that while it's possible they may still be alive we can expect severe dehydration. Elizabeth! Hey, wait. I was wondering if you didn't have any plans for Thanksgiving.. I mean, Tyler and I we have this super-big turkey.. Thank you so much. I'd really love to, but.. - No. - You upset with me? - No. You, a goddess? Please. - A goddess. Please. I just wish that you'd go somewhere for the holidays. I will be somewhere. - I'll be home. - Home. - Don't you ever get lonely? - Oh, I'm around people all day. No, not that kind of lonely. You know, lonely. I mean, come on, look at you. I'd kill to look like that. I'm just not interested in a relationship right now. I mean, I'm not not interested in a relationship. It's just that.. I like things the way they are all simple and uncomplicated. You cannot con me, Elizabeth. Everyone wants someone special. I had someone special, Josie. I had my husband, you know? When he died, it wasn't special anymore. It just hurt. - Ooh, look at that. - Uh-oh, here we go again. I've been looking for one just like that. - This one? - No, that there. 'This one here?' - What? - Oh! Got ya. I can't. You okay? You okay? I got you. It's okay. You're safe. Hang on, Billy. Hang on, partner. It's gonna be okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah. 'Norah, I'm home.' 'Sorry I'm late.' I have your dinner warming in the oven, Mrs. B. Thank you, Norah. - Oh, Mrs. B. - What? You didn't. Norah, of course, I didn't. I made a promise, didn't I? I said no more spending until after New Year's. I wouldn't.. Norah, why are you looking at me like that for? Now, look at me. I'm clean. I don't have a bag on me. Now, listen, I'm certain that you've got pumpkin or turkey or something to get ready for Thanksgiving. - Why don't you go on home? - Anything you say, Mrs. B. Sure you don't need me tomorrow? I'm sure I don't. Happy Thanksgiving, Norah. - You too. - See you Friday. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm-mm. 'There they are! Let's go!' 'Come on.' They're alive! He's alive! Steady! Alright, easy. Billy! Billy! - Take the kid. - Come on. Oh, thank you, thank you for saving my boy. We're comin' through, come on. It's a scene all of America has been waiting for. Park Ranger Jefferson Jones and five-year-old Billy Futterman have been found safe after being lost for nearly a week. For those of you who just tuned in we're looking at live footage of Jefferson Jones' safe return with the little boy. 'They're on their way now to Memorial Hospital' 'where Sam Simon is standing by.' 'After today, there isn't a person alive' 'who won't know the name Jefferson Jones.' 'Not since the Lindbergh kidnapping' 'not since the rescue of Baby Jessica' 'has there been so much interest in a news event.' 'Every TV network, every news service' 'has picked up the story.' 'And television ratings' 'have tripled in the last few hours.' Television ratings have tripled. Body of Christ. Think America. Think Christmas. Think 40-share rating. - 'He pushed me! I was next.' - 'Sir, this is a holy place.' Let's go live now to Memorial Hospital to Sam Simon. Sam, what's going on there? They're bringing Jefferson Jones into the hospital now. As you might imagine, there's much to be thankful for on this Thanksgiving night. Jones and the little boy are both doing as well as can be expected and we've been told that Jones said he's looking forward to his first hot-cooked meal. 'The paramedics are opening the ambulance doors now.' 'And there's Jefferson Jones about to step out.' 'You know, he looks pretty good after six days of starvation' 'and those freezing temperatures' 'but look at him.' 'He's still concerned' 'about Billy's welfare.' 'What a man. What a hero.' 'Jefferson Jones and the boy..' Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You get the idea? Alex, you woke me to show me this? Come on. I admit, the ranger's a real hero but what's that got to do with me? - Listen to me, darling. - I am. He's not just a hero. He's a national hero. Every TV network every news service has picked up the story. Terrific. What does it have to do with me? - But don't you see? - No, I don't. - You're his hero. - Why? - You're a hero's hero. - Why? This is big. Watch. 'We're getting reports about a fire.' Yes, unfortunately, in a tragic twist of fate Jefferson Jones' cabin, his home burned to the ground while he was risking his life to save the child. 'That's right, George, and according to firefighters' one of the only possessions.. 'My cookbook?' ...is this. This is big! Big, big, big. What, just because one of my cookbooks survived a fire? Alex, you need medicine. Because I've sold you as a prime-time special. You what? I convinced Paul Prescott the head of the network, in a church that he ought to give you a prime-time Christmas special. - Are you serious? - I'm serious. What kind of a special? Hero. Saves kid. Loses house. Has nothing, nothing.. ...except his fantasies about your cooking. Your plum pudding, your candied yam your world-famous Christmas goose. Jefferson Jones, come on down. Oh, it's kismet! Are you serious? I'm doing my own.. I'm going prime-time? Not only prime-time, but live. - I'm going live? - Live! Live? Oh, my God, it's an event. Live! Christmas in Connecticut! Christmas in who? Wait 'til all America sees you and all the other Blanes sitting down to a Christmas dinner with Jones himself. Alex, are you crazy? Cover of "TV Guide," easy. Alex, there are no other Blanes. Listen to me, th-th-there is no house in Connecticut. What are you talking about? - Just details. - Details? What... Liz-ball, details. Leave the details to me. I'll take care of it. I need an espresso. I need a buzz! I need a gun. I've got it all figured out. My sister's kids.. ...are gonna be your grandkids. 'That's Kevin and Melissa.' And, uh, Josie, okay? Josie's gonna be your daughter, Mary because she knows how to cook. And I, I shall play your loving, debonair husband.. What's his name? What choice do you have? I'd sooner stick hot needles in my eyes. Ugh! I need something to eat. - I am not gonna do it, Alex. - You gotta do it. Right, well, you just give me one good reason why I should. - Tell me why I should. - The show means promotion. Promotion means ratings. And ratings mean money. Money. Why can't it be me and Jones? Because we've sold the public on you and the family. Now you've got to deliver. Listen, you promised me this would never happen. You promised me! Alex, you and I both know I can't cook. Shh, don't say that so loud. I can't cook, Alex. I can't cook! What are you moaning about? Huh? I saved you. What were you before I rescued you from that from that dead-end magazine, huh? - Happy. I was happy, Alex. - A no-nothing writer. That's what I was. I was happy. Oh, poor baby. And now you're famous. That's right. And in debt. Everybody needs fairy tales. People need cooking, home, devotion. So Cinderella becomes a pumpkin. Well, this pumpkin says no. W-w-well, look, if you won't do it for us, do it for Josie. Think of the little people on the set. They need it as much as anybody. What about Tanya, the cue card girl? - Her name is Theresa. - Theresa? I won't do it. No way! It's out of the question. I-I know it's a lot to ask, Tyler. I-I do know that. I-it'll only be for a couple of days. - Right. Why? - Impossible. Look, do you think I like doing this? Do you think I live to hand out menus for Chucky's Chicken Chuckwagon? - You look very cute. I mean.. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, really? - Really. When was the last time you had to wear a feather suit to work? I'm an actor. I have an audition on the 27th and I need to prepare. And I need to cook for Elizabeth. Well, wait a minute. I got a great idea. Why not look at it this way? I mean...you could prepare as my son-in-law out in Connecticut. I mean, this might be the opportunity that you've been thinking of. Tyler, think of all the people that will be seeing you on this special. Directors... The operative word is "Your special." No one's gonna notice me. I'll just be an insignificant speck in the constellation of your stardom. Why must you always do this, Tyler? Look, I need a break! - He needs a break. - I need to be noticed. And not as Elizabeth Blane's son, but as an artist. Why don't you just tell her what you're auditioning for? - What are you auditioning for? - I'm up for a serial killer. On "Days Of Love." - Oh, isn't that nice? - Real art. Oh, sure, i-i-it's a good time to joke about it now. But what about in two years from now? Huh? What if this turns into a lead? Then we'll be talking a totally different story. I'm not gonna blow this audition. And if you don't do this, I could be out of a job, Tyler. And we could be out on the streets. So adjust. Y-you can adjust, Tyler. 'Adjustment is nice.' You never cease to amaze me, Jefferson. Even burned my pipe. You? On some cooking show. 'I don't believe it.' Elizabeth Blane is not only America's favorite cook she's America's favorite mom. Got a husband, kid grandkid, people. Lots of people, get it? You hate people. So why do it? I got 25,000 reasons one for every dollar the network's payin' me. You're not going Hollywood on me, are you? Listen, if these people want to think I sit around dreaming about this Blane woman's Christmas goose whatever that is.. It gets me the money to put this back up I can put up with her stuff for a couple of days. Elizabeth Blane hunts her own Christmas goose. 'She's famous for it.' You're such a big fan, you better brush up. I will. When are you leaving? Soon as I'm packed. I'm packed. Alex. 'Alex.' Alex. God! What are you doing, Alex? I'm getting in the part of your loving husband. Who's your role model? Hugh Hefner? Look at you. Let me show you the rest of the house. Come on. This is the entry hall, going in through this magnificent.. What was that, dear? That was my nephew, uh, Andrew. Anthony! My name's Anthony. Your name is Kevin and he's your grandson. - He doesn't look seven. - I'm ten. - Well, it's close enough. - You don't look ten. - Where's the TV? - I don't know. - What good are you? - I don't know. Mrs. B? Oh, Norah, Norah, I'm so glad to see you. I-I'm so.. I know you.. Who's this? I don't know this. - This is my sister's other kid. - Oh. - Your grandchild, Melissa. - Oh. - Isn't she adorable? - Isn't she? She's got your eyes and my.. What is going on? Hey! Hey! D-d-don't. Why is everybody so.. What? What? Aww, I'll get her bottle. Hello. I know exactly how you feel, dear. Okay. Uh-uh. Right. Oh, no. Oh. Oh. - What is it? - Oh, drool. - Drool? - Here. What are you doing? Wait a min.. Norah! Hello! Why do you do that? - Kevin! - 'Thank you.' Kevin, come and meet your mother and father. Anthony! What? What? Now listen to me. Your name is Kevin. And when I say Kevin, you come, okay? - You can call me... - Grandmother? Granny? Gramps? You call me that, I'll put you in my soup. Tyler, I'm so glad to see you. Kevin, this is your father. Ever wondered what it would feel like to sew your eyes closed? - Charming. - Cool. - Is he alright? - He's in character. He refuses to give up the soap audition. What about the character of my son-in-law? - I'm here, aren't I? - Thank you very much. - We fought all the way. - How come? - 'I'll tell you later.' - Hey! 'Hon, where are you going?' - I'll be back. - I love that guy. Kevin, this is your mother. - Kevin, I'm talking to you! - Is he-is he alright? He's just a little strange, that's all. The kitchen's there. Don't touch that! - 'This is your daughter.' - D-d-don't touch that. Oh, she is so cute. What's the matter? What's the matter? - Put it down! - Oops! No! Are you.. What happened? Not.. Oh! Told you to be careful, didn't I? Don't yell! Do you have any idea how much money I had to put up as a security deposit? - Hello? - You idiot! - I hate you! - 'Hello.' - Ouch! - Hello? Will somebody stop the ringing, please? What? Who's ringing? Hello? - Everybody out! - That's the fax phone. The fax. Norah, I want to be alone now. Mm-hmm. - Mrs. Blane? - Ow! - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Who are you? You're Jefferson Jones. Afraid so, ma'am. - What are you doing here? - Excuse me? What are you doing here today? Today.. You're not supposed to be here until the 25th. - Not according to this fax. - What fax? This one. "Please come early and get to know my family. Signed, Elizabeth Blane." That's it! I'm outta here. I'm not.. You don't want to listen to my needs, forget about it. What about what I want? - You're so destructive! - It wasn't my fault! You're breaking everything. Where is the diaper bag? Mr. Jones, I'd like to introduce my family. Family, this is Jefferson Jones. - Jonesy. I see you got my fax. - Your fax? Uh, I-I cut a deal with "People Magazine." They're gonna write a story on how America's hostess spends three days with America's hero. Oh, isn't that nice? Maybe you could just show me where my room is. Oh, nonsense. I want you to meet the family. Oh, by the way, I'm-I'm Mr. Elizabeth Blane. - But you can call me, uh.. - John. - Uh, John. - John Blane. And I'm mighty proud of it. Mr. Jones, let me introduce you to my family. I'd like you to meet my daughter, Mary and her husband, Evan. I love the smell of human hair when it burns. I've been traveling all night. Maybe I could go wash up? - That's the... - Can I have my allowance now? I beg your pardon, dear? My special ten dollar allowance, granny. Ask your grandfather. Get it from him, dear. And this little pudge-face is my granddaughter, Melissa. Aw. She's so cute. She's got your eyes. Oh. 'Well, you know, it's hard to believe, looking at you' 'that you got two grandchildren.' Yes, I-I find it really hard to believe it myself sometimes. We are vampires. We suck the blood of innocents and stay forever young. Sweet. Mary, why don't you and Evan take the children upstairs? - 'Norah, I got the baby.' - I'll hold it for you. Will you show Mr. Jones to his room, please? - Oh, sure. - Oh, that'd be good. Sure. Huh. Which one? Oh, Norah hasn't been with us for very long. It's the first one on the left, Norah. Thank you. When should I start dinner? Aren't you the cook? Of course, I'm the cook. But that's my occupation. So since, since I'm on vacation Mary's gonna take over in the kitchen until Christmas. Thanks, Mary. Any time you want now. You have an interesting family. Yes, aren't they? Very interesting. Ooh! That's very manly of you. You were running low. Thank you. Whoo! Well, I-I suppose you just love being outside. I mean, coming from that mountainy place you come from. - Colorado. - 'Colorado.' - Smell that? - Oh. Yes, that's my, my Chanel No.5. Cedar. Of course. Cedar. I bet you can't buy that at Bloomingdale's. You're right. Um, so, um.. ...how long did you live alone up in that.. ...cabin place? - Eleven years. - Eleven years? Oh! Alone alone? I mean, no.. - Women? - Pets. - Neither. - Oh. Well, that's a long time. I thought about it a lot. - 'Women?' - Pets. Oh. Oh. Excuse me. Hi, Mary. Hi. - I can't do this. - Why? What's the matter? Hi, sweetie. What's the matter, Mary? Mary's under a lot of stress. Mary isn't... Maybe we should finish up for her. - Finish up what? - Her bath. You ought to be an expert at this. Oh. It's no big deal, you know? There's water, there-th-th-there's soap. There's a rubber duck. It's pretty routine. You know what? I just had the most wonderful idea. How would you like to bathe her? - Me? - Sure. I think it'd be fun for you. Here. Let go of my hair, sweetheart. - Yeah. - Ah. You want to get in the bath? You two just have fun, okay? I'll see you in a while. Hey, where are you going? You're gonna supervise for me? - Supervise. - Whoa, come on. - Hi, sweetie! Hi! - Is it too hot? - Oh! Hi! - Oh. It is too hot. - Hi, honey! Hi! - I don't blame you. - Don't get water in her eyes. - No, I'm not, I'm not. - I'm okay. - Got any soap? 'Soap. Oh, of course, soap.' - Want some soap? - Well.. Here's some soap, sweetie. - Is it just a little hot? - There's the soap. Here's a duck. What about her hair? Should we wash it? Well, I'll rinse and you put shampoo on her. 'Alright.' - 'Okay.' - 'Alright. That's too much.' 'What do you mean it's too much?' 'I'm telling you.' 'Watch her eyes. I told you.' Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. My fault. Sorry, you're right. You're the expert. Oh, you sweet thing. Sorry. I don't know if we got all the soap out. - Well...we did. - She-she likes that. You're awfully good at that for a bachelor, you know? You sure you don't have a whole slew of kids hidden somewhere? I nursed a couple of bear cubs till their mother came back. - This is better than bear cubs. - Yes. Ain't she a beauty? Oh! Josie, there you are. Don't you ever do that to me again. You hand me this small, little, slippery, wet baby. I don't know how to handle a baby. I've never.. What's the matter, babe? Huh? Do you want to talk about it? No. Okay. Tyler's leaving me. Tyler's what? I want to have a baby, Liz. He doesn't. Oh, Josie, the two of you can work it out, can't you? You've seen the way Tyler behaves. Like Charles Manson. Do you know what it's like living like that? When he was up for Felix in "The Odd Couple" we had the biggest fight of our marriage over a coffee ring on the table. And when he was up for the stage manager in "Our Town" we had to experience small-town life by moving in with his parents, in Dayton, Ohio! 'With every new part' comes a completely different personality. He is so obsessed with his career. How are we ever going to have a life together? Why don't you just be honest? It won't change anything. You know something? It might. It just might. Jo, Jonesy! Hey, Jonesy baby, wait a minute. Mind if I, uh, come along with you? You don't, uh, mind me tagging along, do you? - Uh-uh. Come on. - Nice and nippy. Thanks. Uh, well, I did want to have a little talk with you, you know? Since I'm the producer and I'm giving you 25 grand for the show I thought maybe I'd tell you what's what. You know, you're gonna see a part of, uh, showbiz that very few people see, you know? Show business magic. Right. And, so, therefore, I just wanted to, you know bring you up to date with everything. There may be a time, there's just the possibility.. I'm not sure that it's gonna happen, but it is a possibility that at somewhere along the line.. Oh, it's really chilly. That somewhere along the line you're not going to see, uh Elizabeth, uh, cook. Is, uh.. You got any questions? How long have you two been married? Well, time is relative and relative is relative, you know? But it's been worth every minute of it. And you know what I mean by worth. She's like a Cabernet of love. She gets richer, fuller, more intoxicating with age, you know? You know what I think it is? I think it's chemical. Every time I get a whiff of her I wanna take her in my arms and give her a kiss. You know what drives her crazy? When I suck her toes. She goes crazy, like a horse. But look who I'm talking to. A good-looking guy like you. You're out there getting all that action, huh? Nobody ever neighed for me. Well, that takes a little special finesse. I could teach you how to do it if you want. Uh, can I ask you a question, please? It's 40 degrees below zero out here. What are we doing here? I was taking a walk. Oh. Well, enjoy yourself. Without the cover, you got no story. I told you that. You're late. You snooze, you lose. Tell me something, do you dream in color or in black and white? Uh, w-w-would you please pass me that end piece? Can I have some potatoes? Is your food alright? Yeah, I just fill up quick these days. 'Of course, after what you've been through.' Hey, mister, if they didn't find you would you have eaten that kid? Kevin.. - I don't think so. - Pass the potatoes. Would you have eaten your own foot? - Kevin! - Maybe. Would you like some peas? Well, uh, how do you like this chow, huh? I bet you didn't run across any Chateaubriand in the forest, did you? No, this is real good. I guess I'm just more a 4:00 a.m. black-coffee-bacon- and-flapjacks kind of person. Flapjack? What a coincidence. Elizabeth wrote a whole book about flapjacks. - Yeah? - You want flapjacks? Mary will cook them in the morning. - The potatoes? - I love flapjacks. - Pass the potatoes! - 'Mary..' Here! Shut up! Do you have to talk to him that way? He's only a kid. Oh, that's right. You're the big expert on kids, right? At least I want them! Fine. Dessert, anyone? I noticed you don't have a Christmas tree. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. - Oh! Well, there's a good reason for that. Very good reason for that. Uh, uh, we have to wait until Christmas. Yeah. - We wait until Christmas. - Why? Why? Why. - For the show. - Of course, our show. - Absolutely. - Yeah. See, the set decorator comes in and he does the whole house. - Oh, the whole house. - Mm-hmm. - Every nook and cranny. - Yes. Uh, uh, normally... Normally, we have a huge Christmas tree. - Yes. - Really big. A veritable redwood, you know? Uh, but this year, we have prime-time. Yes. Oh. Mr. Jones, you're such a fascinating man. 'I was just wondering, have you always been a Park Ranger?' Actually, before I moved to Colorado, I lived in Chicago. I grew up there. Taught comparative literature at the university for ten years. Really? Wow! - Then I quit and moved west. - 'Why?' 'I mean, why would you give up teaching?' 'I don't know, I got offered tenure' and head of the department, and it's what I thought I wanted but, uh, it meant being caged in by concrete and crowds for the rest of my life. 'One day I went to work and it was like' 'going into a long, dark tunnel.' I knew I was never going to see the other end. I couldn't do it. People were telling me what to do. I had to be outdoors. You know what I'm talking about? - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. Living out here. Excuse me. I admire you for giving up the city, you know to raise a family in the country. You figured it out before I did. We try. Well, it's been a, uh, a long day. I-I think I'm gonna turn in. - Elizabeth? - What? - Time to go to bed. - Together? I mean, it's-it's only 9:30, dear. Yeah, but you know what they say in the country. - What do they say? - Early to bed, early to rise. But that's if you've got cows and things. This is Connecticut, and we've got guests. - Yeah. - You go to bed. But you know I can't sleep without you. We're like two spoons. For God's sakes, John, what are you talking about? - Well, I mean... - We have company. Please, Jonesy's a grown man... 'Well, of course, he's a grown man.' - 'You're a grown man too.' - 'Yes, but still.' - 'So go to bed alone.' - No, I don't wanna go alone. Well, dear, I want you to. - You go on-you all go on. - No! We don't have to go. - 'Mom!' - Yes? - Can you come up here? - Yes, of course, I will. No, she can't. - Mom and dad are going to bed. - What is it, darling? Kevin wants Grandma to read him a bedtime story. Aw. Kevin wants grandma to read him a bedtime story. I couldn't disappoint Kevin, could I? Excuse me, please, Mr. Jones. John. Yes. No. She's such a mother. I've never been out on a date before. Kevin, you want to make $20 cash right now? Get in bed, pretend like I'm reading to you. Hustle. "It was his destiny to slay the dragon "and save the kingdom. "The great big kingdom was there. Absolutely there." Hey, where's my $20? Okay. For 50 bucks, I can fake a nightmare and sleep in your bed. Thanks, Kev-O. I'll keep that in mind. 'I'll remember that.' Thought you were going to bed? Oh. I was. Just, you know, doing my exercises. Very important to stay in shape, you know. - Goodnight! - Goodnight. 'Forgot the toothpaste.' Norah, you scared me half to death. - What are you doing down here? - I was fixing myself a snack. I heard a woman scream. Oh! We didn't hear anything, did we? Unh-unh. I thought you were going to bed. So did I. So did I. Goodnight. - Uh, Mrs. Blane? - Yes? Are you going for the goose tomorrow? The goose? 'The Christmas goose.' The one we hunt every Christmas Eve morning? After having slept all night together? Oh, that goose. I knew about goose. I just thought that this year with the show and everything we wouldn't do that. I'd love to come along with you. I saw a whole flock of geese this morning. Oh, you can't. I'm sorry, but we only have two guns or two rifles, that.. - Isn't that right? - I don't know. Don't start me to lying. Isn't that right, John? Oh, well, I could check around. No, we couldn't possibly. You see, it's a family tradition. Every year, just John and me. Well, he could take my place. - Are you sure? - Are you kidding? You're my guest. Oh, what time do we start? Early. Very, very early. In fact, I don't wanna wake you up, darling. I'd better sleep in the den. No, no, no, I don't think that's necessa... Oh, it is necessary, my sweet... - No. - My darling. Goodnight. 'Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no!' Oh, what the.. Oh! Oh! Oh! No! 'Good mornin'.' 'Ready for the hunt?' "The hunt." Coffee? No, thank you. I don't want any coffee. Well, you sleep well last night? Yeah, I slept okay. What is that? - What? - That? - That's the sun. - No. That is the sun? It's all pink and blue... - You got any sugar? - Sure. Sugar. Sugar, sugar. Someplace. - Sugar. - Forget it. - We gotta get goin'. - I have an orange. - Do you want an orange? - Let's go. - Two oranges? - Yeah. Okay. You always wear all those clothes when you go huntin'? Always. Do you ever get hot? Are you kiddin' me? Never. Oh! You're staring at me. Sorry. It's my hair, isn't it? It's all poofy. No, you look fine. I was just wonderin' how you do it. Do what? Live out here. Take care of a family. Maintain a career. Look like you do. It's gotta be the clean living. Or the facials I get every week. You know, I know this might be hard for you to accept but I actually like New York City. And the crime? Theaters. - Pollution. - Museums. - Sex, drugs... - Rock and roll. I love the whole scene. Wouldn't seem so great if you couldn't escape to Connecticut. 'Oh, well.' Hey, wait for me. Would you carry my gun? And me? You know, this is-this is great. I really love this. Can we turn around now? 'Cause you got everything. Beautiful home, successful career, terrific family. What more could you possibly want? Maybe to be appreciated for more than my beautiful home successful career, and incredible family. I know. You do? Yeah, you have grace, intelligence and a sense of humor. It's a killer combination. Why, Jefferson Jones I actually think you're flirting with me. Ah, this is crazy. Listen. Oh, it's a family. Aren't they sweet? What are you doing? You're not gonna.. 'Didn't get it, huh?' Good morning, family! Forget it. Hey, I think they're coming. They're here! Alright, everybody let's make it look family time. 'Let's go. Elizabeth's here, come on.' If you won't do it for me do it for Elizabeth! Ah, there you go. 'That's it.' 'Perfect.' "Captain Flash came screaming from the sky from his rocket ship." Oh, good morning! Good morning. Get a grip, gramps. Yeah, gramp, get a grip. Hi, gorgeous. - Where's dinner? - Oh, buy a turkey. I missed a goose by a mile. Somethin' distracted me. 'It sure did.' You're just in time to flip the flapjacks, dumpling. Flapjacks? Well, I'm not in a flipping mood this morning. Let Norah do it. - I don't flip, I scoop. - Oh, you do? No, I want you to flip me a flapjack, please. You haven't done one in such a long time. - What? - For me. If not for me, do it for our honored guest, Jonesy. Jonesy, wouldn't you love to see her flapjack? Absolutely. We'd love to see you flip a flapjack. You'd love to see me flip a flapjack? - Please! Yes. Mm-hmm. - Flip a flapjack, for you? I'd be happy to, John. Happy to. - Oh, my God. - 'This is gonna be good.' - Norah, make way. - 'Come on, Jonesy.' Alright, gather around, everyone. - Come on. - This is it. This is it. Yeah! - 'Yeah, alright!' - Do another one. No, no, no, no, sorry, folks. One is my limit. Make way. I'll see you in a while. Go away. Go away! Oh, God, I know I'm gonna regret this. Okay, the door isn't locked. Come in. Liz, it's Tyler. - He's gone. - What? I just checked the room. He took all of his things. Oh, come on, sweetie. It's alright, come on. It's alright. Come on, we'll think of something. 'Attention, all passengers' 'train from Eastport leaving to Hartford, Bristol and New...' Tyler! '...has been delayed.' Tyler, aren't you a little bit old to be running away from home? You know, Josie's really worried sick about you, Tyler. I know this is gonna surprise you.. ...but I know what you're going through, Tyler. I know just the way you feel. Good, then we don't have to talk about it, do we? You want that career so badly, you can taste it, right? Nothing else can come in front of it. Let me ask you somethin'. If you had to choose.. Tyler, if you had to give up Josie for your career, would you do that? No, of course not. I would never want that. But when you're just starting out your career has to come first. Bull! Tyler, if you have someone to love who loves you back everything else is secondary. I don't care what it is. Your home, your job, your career, everything. Easy to say from where you sit. Especially from where I sit, mister. Listen to me. All those wonderful things that go with a sensational career all those things don't mean diddlysquat if you don't have someone special to share them with. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Do you? Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Tyler is a loser. With a capital L. He is a loser. And here's a beautiful woman like you crying over a ding-dong loser. I can't believe it. I hate losers! You know why? 'Cause I'm a winner. And you know what winners can do? Winners know how to treat a woman. I know what a woman wants. I know what a woman needs. I know what a woman feels. Now, take that.. Take this Jefferson. Jefferson, huh. You think he knows what a woman wants? He's dumb! Lives in a log cabin, dresses like Howdy Doody. What does he know about women? Do you think Elizabeth could go for a guy like that? - Yeah. - Think about it a little bit. A log cabin? She lives in this beautiful penthouse in New York City goes to the theater, parties with me. I mean, you got to be out of your head to even consider something like that! What am I doing up here? Giving me advice. Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, exactly. I got it. Go blond and dump Tyler. Come on, give me a little smile. 'I've been lookin' for you.' 'Hi.' I had to run some errands. How you doin'? Do you think John would mind if I borrowed you for half an hour? Well, you know, I'm not the family mule. You don't have to ask him for permission to spend time with me. If you want to ask someone, ask me. You mean yes? I've been trying to think of a scene where the husband and wife kiss and make up. Maybe you can improvise. Improvise? Okay. Josie, I'm sorry. I don't want to fight anymore. I'm bored! Can we do something? Kevin, I don't think this is a good time. Okay, I'll wait. So you want to show me trees? - A Christmas tree. - What do you... I saw it yesterday when I took a walk. I found this beautiful little tree. It reminded me of you. I've been thinkin' about it ever since. Oh, but we can't have, we can't have our own tree. I know all about the show and the set decorator and you gotta use your own decorations... - Right. - This is Christmas Eve. You gotta have a tree. For the kids. I think it's a great idea. What do you think? This tree? It's a nice little tree. Well, let's go. Look at you. Sitting there so innocent.. ...so beautiful. You tried to make me think it was okay.. ...but it isn't! You lied to me! You lied! And now it's time to pay the price. Okay, okay. This is when you say.. "Roger, you're sick. You need help. Killing me won't solve anything." "Killing me won't solve anything." Who writes this stuff? Certainly not you. You're too smart. You'll probably go your whole adorable little life never even watching a soap opera, yeah. You don't watch that stuff. Okay. Back in character. You gotta help here now, darlin'. I gotta think psychopath. 'Now's my chance.' Finally alone! I've had about enough of you crying all hours of the night! I got news for you. 'I'm gonna sell you.' 'That's right.' 'We're broke, so you're going' 'to the highest bidder.' Yeah, a kid like you ought to keep us in gravy for the rest of the year. And then I'll have to kill the rest of 'em ! And I know just how I'll do it. But first things first. Look, look, Josie. 'You look just like him.' - Hey, they're back. - Oh, look! Hey, what's that? What does it look like? It's our Christmas tree. Where's the wooden stand the lot guy always makes you pay five bucks for? It didn't come from a lot. It came from the forest. - Weird. - I'll show you weird. - 'Wipe your shoes off.' - Hey, tree time! 'Okay, give way. Oh, don't get it all over.' 'Careful, Kevin.' Hi, mommy! How was she? Oh, right over in front of the window. - Where're the decorations? - Decorations? - Psst! - Wait a minute. You got some, don't you? Decora.. Yeah, no. Actually, we had a burglary, uh, last year. They-they stole all of the decorations. What kind of a person steals Christmas decorations? - A bad person. - Psst! It's very important. Just give me a second, wait. What is it? - You got any popcorn? - Yes! - Cranberries? - Oh, we have everything. - We've everything... - Y-yes. And I got, uh, lights put out front. We're in business. - Alright, that's it, come on. - I'll get it. No, don't pull on my cranberries. Okay. Ah, this is so frustrating when you can't get these things undone. - Hey. - What? Watch. Oh, show-off. 'Look how easily he did that.' 'You guys, save some popcorn..' 'Hey, Kevin..' ...you guys finished down there? - Yeah! - Yeah, we're all finished. - Hey, hey, hey, hey! - Whoa! I have a surprise. - Look, I made cookies! - Norah, you're so sweet. - Look at these. - Aren't they beautiful? Can we make some skull heads? Skull heads? Oh, that's a good idea. We'll all make skull heads, go on. Alright, come on, dad. I am not making skull heads. - Yes, you are now. - Are they making skull heads? 'What's a skull head?' You got left with the cookie in your mouth. Look at that, they left us and stranded us. I guess we're gonna have to decorate the tree, huh? - I don't like that there... - I guess so. Let me see where this belongs. Now, wait a minute. - Right there. - You can't do that. - Why not? - It's too big. Look, the big ones go on the bottom. But I don't like it there. Why do they have to go on the bottom? Because the little ones go on top. I don't like rules. I hate rules. It's perfect. But, you know, the top of the tree looks really empty. Oh, I know just what to put up there. I'll get it and come right back. I think there's something wrong with Tyler. Oh, Tyler's alright. I mean, I think he's a little confused... No, there's something not right about him. Something not right about a lot of things around here. He-he-he could be dangerous. Come on, Alex. He's about as dangerous as that little baby downstairs. What's her name? Melissa. Yeah, but listen, oh.. He could ruin the show. You know, it's not too late to recast him. Oh, Alex, you really worry too much. You know, you really do. I mean, this is Christmas, munchkins. What in the world could possibly go wrong? Oh! - 'What is that?' - 'Oh, it's so beautiful.' 'I'm tellin' you, I think that skull head' 'would look much better.' - It's perfect. - Just like a pro. Okay. I knew it would be just right. 'I guess it's pretty cool. Yeah.' - It's nice. - 'Let's light it!' - Yeah, let's go for it. - Go ahead, go for it. Alright. Watch closely. - Oh! - Oh, yeah, alright! Oh! I can't believe it. - We did that. - 'I like it.' You act like you never had one before. I haven't! I mean, I.. Uh, uh, not this beautiful. I just think this is the most beautiful tree in the world. I've never seen anything.. You know what, I-I was gonna wait till morning but I just can't now. Okay, just.. I'll explain when I get back. Just wait a minute, okay? - You're good at that, kid. - Okay. - Jefferson. - Oh, gifts! Hmm. Merry Christmas. Oh! - Sweetheart. - I love gifts. - Merry Christmas. - This is so beautiful. I think I know what it is, yes. "Love Isn't Always Easy." This is the one exactly what we need, Tyler. - It's what you need. - No, it's what you need. It's what you need. Alright. This is just what I need. 'Oh, my God, look at this.' 'How to make babies, Tyler.' 'This is what we need.' - Oh, thank you. - 'I love it.' Oh! Look at me. Where's Alex? Look what I got. I got a cone. I love these glasses.. Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. Mwah! - Merry Christmas! - You know what? - What? We didn't get you anything. I don't need anything. - I've got you. - Oh, not so fast. - What? - I got something for you. 'Alright, look at that!' What is that? Well, since yours is up on the tree.. ...I figured you might want that. - Ah, look at my.. - 'Oh, how sweet!' I love it. Thank you very much. Time to celebrate! - Great timing! - Champagne! Oh. - Oh, look at this. - Oh. There. - Thank you. - Anyhow. - Here we go. - No chance, unh-uh. Alright, you can hold it, but don't drink. I wanna make a toast before you do anything, okay? Just a little toast here. To my family. - Oh. - Oh, no! 'Who turned out the lights?' 'Ooh, it's dark.' 'Tyler, let's go make a baby right now.' 'Who's touching me?' 'Get your hands off.' '"It was was the night before Christmas' '"when all through the house' '"not a creature was stirring' '"not even a mouse.' '"The stockings were hung by the chimney with care' '"in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.' "The children were nestled all snug in their beds while visions of sugar plums danced in their..." Oh, look what I have for everyone. Your favorite chocolate coconut angels. Come on in. It's open! ♪ Silent night ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm ♪ All is bright ♪ Round yon.. Well, it's been an absolutely perfect Christmas. We're so happy that you could all join us and special thanks to our guest, Jefferson Jones. God bless you all. And cut! You were perfect.. Nice. Very nice. Next year, let's do Christmas in Florida. It's way too cold here. 'Kill the fire, alright?' 'It was great.' 'You were all so wonderful.' - Thank you. - It was lousy! Lousy! Nothing worked! Hey, you guys out there with the snow you made it look like dandruff! And, Kevin, I told you, the minute the doorbell rings say "Come on in." And stop eating the props! Huh, now! Uh, can't you get that baby to smile? Smile. Huh? This tree! I hate this tree! This green tree I hate! 'So, green tree out!' 'Bring in the traditional pink one.' - 'Come on, let's go, guys.' - I loved our tree. 'Time is wasting.' Now, Tyler, right? You-you were really excellent. Really, I.. Jefferson.. Look...you're a little too wooden. Just smile a little bit more, okay? You're not playing in a funeral. I told you, I don't play the piano. - I feel like an idiot. - No, no. You don't feel like an idiot. You don't look like an idiot. You look great. Okay. Would somebody please shut the music? Alright, everybody! From the top! Mrs. B! Some local folks just called and invited you to town for their Christmas dance. - Oh, how nice! - Oh, ho, ho. Seeing as how you haven't got anything else to do what should I tell them? Tell them no! - Tell them yes. - No, no, no, we can't do it! We've gotta make this show look very spontaneous. The only way to do that is to do it over and over again. Somebody's liable to freeze on television! Whoa! Hold it! Everybody! Hey, hold it! Right now, hold it! - What? - Everybody take a break. There's such a thing as too much rehearsing. - No, no.. We can't, we.. - Take a break, have a.. Let's do it one more time, everybody. - 'Merry Christmas.' - 'Yeah.' - Isn't this beautiful? - Yeah. Oh, I just love it out here. Boy, thanks for getting me out of there. Oh, it's okay. Your husband can be kind of a... I know, he gets obnoxious when somebo.. I mean, you must run into his type even in your line of work. Not exactly. Maybe an occasional skunk. Oh, Mr. Jones, you ready to dance? - Yes. - Let's do it. Oh. Look at that! Oh, my! Honey, look! A-are you Elizabeth Blane? I watch your cooking show. - You're wonderful, I love you. - Oh, we love you. Thank you. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. 'Isn't he somebody too?' 'Come on, come on.' Oh, look, our guests are here! - Welcome. - Come on. 'Woo-hoo!' Come on, come on. 'Whoo!' 'Alright.' - 'Whoo!' - 'Yeah.' - 'Yay.' - 'Whoo.' 'Yee-haw.' 'Ya-hoo.' 'Yee-haw.' Whoa! 'One more time!' 'You were terrific.' Yeah! - I'm havin' a great time! - I think we'd better go. Oh, look! Oh, it's a sleigh! Oh, I've always wanted to ride one of those. I bet you could drive it. - It's not ours. - I know it's not. But we could borrow it, couldn't we? I mean, couldn't we borrow it. Come on. Come on, oh, come on. Let's do it. - Get in. - Alright! Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Where the hell is Elizabeth? Huh? Would somebody.. Will you stop that? Will somebody please go and find me Elizabeth? She said she'd be right back, and right back means right back! Never mind! Never mind! I'll go find her myself. Nobody's.. Never mind! Oh! Mr. Prescott. We weren't expecting you. - This is an important show. - Mm-hmm, yes. Do you have a problem with the head of the network being here? Are you kidding? Not at all. Come on in. - Please. - Where's Elizabeth? Elizabeth is in wardrobe. But why don't we go and take a look at some of the production values that are going to be insipid in the show? You're gonna love what you're gonna see tonight. It's really gonna be a magnificent show. What.. Thank you so much. Is that makeup you're wearing? No, no, no, I don't wear.. Oh, we-well yes, it is. You see, I-I'm playing Elizabeth's husb.. No, I'm not.. I'm not playing as husband. I-I am Elizabeth's husband. - You're Elizabeth's husband? - Yeah, yes, I am. I thought his name was John Blane. W-well, i-i-it is. You see, I changed, uh, my name for professional reasons. You know? You know how it is. - That's quite a surprise, Alex. - Hm, yeah. I don't like surprises. Come on. Are you laughing at me? Oh, no. No, believe me, if I'm laughing at anyone it's at Elizabeth Blane. Why? Oh, she's so smart, you know? I mean, she knows all the answers. She gets herself into a real mess and just hasn't got the moral courage to get herself out. What kind of mess? The kind other people wouldn't understand. Does it have anything to do with your...marriage? In a way. You're not very happy, are you? Happy as I have any right to be. Don't say that. You deserve all the happiness you can get. I do? We'd better turn around. Wait. Do you hear that? Do you hear it? Those are the bells. Those are the Christmas bells. Listen. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, yourself. Kevin, don't touch that. I said, don't touch that cake, you. 'I must've looked at it before you.' They're not on the grounds. This is not like Elizabeth. Maybe they got into an accident! I'm sure they're gonna be fine. Just one lick. I gotta go find her. And whatever you do, don't let Alex in this kitchen. Because if he finds out I'm gone.. 'But wait, I'll be, I'll be back in plenty of time.' Don't worry, I'll take care of Alex. Okay. - Will you get out of my way? - You talkin' to me? Are you deaf? Move! You talkin' to me? Ain't nobody else here. You must be talking to me. No! No, no, I wasn't talking to you. Come on. Come on. Turn! 'Okay.' Let's just, let's just, for a moment uh, make-believe that.. ...I'm not who you think I am. What do you mean? Okay. What if I didn't live in Connecticut? Well, you do. 'Yeah, but what if that house' 'back there wasn't my house' 'and that family wasn't my family and..' ...Elizabeth Blane, the homemaker that all America loves wasn't even.. ...married...at all? Well, you are married and that's the point. And I don't think you oughta be fooling around with somebody's feelings like this. See, you're not listening to me. Okay. What if I wasn't the Elizabeth Blane that you think you know? I don't care about that Elizabeth Blane. I never even heard of her until they asked me to do this damn show. What do you mean you never heard? You.. Wait a minute. You've never heard of me? I read one of your books on the plane because I was getting so much money I figured I oughta do my homework. You mean that you came here just because of.. Mm-hmm. This is not funny. You only came here for the money? 'And you, and you've never read one of my books. Is that right?' Have you? It means you're nothing but a big phony, right? That doesn't change the fact that you're a married woman. Just let me tell you what's really going on, okay? I am.. Freeze! Stealing my sleigh, and on Christmas too. We didn't steal your sleigh. That's not what happ... I suppose the horse kidnapped you. - Took you on a six mile ride. - Well... Put your hands where I can see 'em. You're both under arrest. - Oh, come on. - Come on, you foreheads. - Get 'em up. - You what? 'Well, look at this.' Let me have a look at it. Let me see. Yeah. What kind of a show are you running here? - What's going on here? - Don't worry. - She'll be here. - And where is Elizabeth? I don't know. Where is she? Every one of those people are on the clock! Well, don't worry. It's alright. The local police wish you a happy holiday. Two hundred dollar ticket. Yes, I'm fine. Well, welcome home, darling. You're on in five minutes! - 'Oh, she's here.' - So are you. - Where is she coming from? - But that's alright. She's here now. Five minute.. Four minutes. Let me take you to the control room. You'll love this place. - Come along. Come here. - 'Make up. Hair.' 'And welcome to the live special presentation' 'of "Christmas in Connecticut."' 'Staring Elizabeth Blane' 'and her real-life family..' Okay, we need the title card up. '...by America's favorite hero' 'Jefferson Jones.' 'And now, here is your hostess, Elizabeth Blane!' Merry Christmas and welcome. I'm Elizabeth Blane and this is my home. I'm so glad you could all join us tonight. We're going to have a wonderful time. 'So I just want you to all but sit back' relax and enjoy a good old-fashioned '"Christmas in Connecticut."' 'You know, for so many years' 'you've heard me talk about my family' now, I'm just delighted I get to introduce them to you. Okay, here we go. We're going to pull out. Alright. Here's this beautiful little pudge-face my granddaughter, Melissa. Ah, look at that, huh? 'My very handsome son-in-law, Evan.' And my beautiful daughter, Mary who isn't here. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - 'Where's Mary?' What's.. "Where's Mary?" Wait. What does she mean, "Where's Mary?" Oh, I just remembered. I sent her out to get some marshmallows. Alright, alright, never mind, never mind, never mind. - She saved it. - She went out to look for you. Oh! Ha-ha-ha! This little rascal is my grandson.. Kevin, wipe your face, dear. Yes, later, I'm going to make his favorite. - 'Chocolate coconut angels.' - Wait. wait, wait, too fast. - Hold on. Just a second. - I don't feel so good. You don't, darling? Well, I hope you do later. Because we want to save some room for that goose, don't we, darling? Oh! Here's my loving husband, John. Ha-ha-ha. John. Hello, sweetheart. How are you doing, darling? - Uh, h-h-honey, what's, uh.. - What? W-w-what's for d-din.. - 'Oh.' - 'D-din.. Oh.' Yes, tell something. Say something! Speak! Oh, sweetheart, I want you to relax. All the millions of people that are watching out there are our friends. Now.. Joel, I have no idea what's going on. Why don't you tell them all about your special recipe for the Blane family eggnog? - Nog? - "Nog?" - What does "Nog" mean? What.. - The nog. He's sweet. Darling, you know, later we were gonna, we were gonna pop some popcorn the old-fashioned way. We have a popper over here, we have a fire. Darling, why don't we do that now? Just sit down here. Just wait and relax. I think I'm gonna throw up. Yes, dear, we know. Why don't we all go into the kitchen and see how dinner is going? - What? What is she doing? - 'Wait, what?' - This is.. I.. - 'Go to three.' - Give me a shot of the kid. - 'Yeah, three.' 'Oh, boy. Okay.' Look, I don't need to see a shot of the kid throwing up! Come on! This is live television. - 'All that wonderful food.' - Out of the way! Go, go, go! - Doesn't it smell nice? - But that kitchen's not ready! Tell the people in the kitchen to get out of there! ...smell those yummy things in here, can't you? - Give me another camera. - 'I dare you to.' - 'Come around, or lose that.' - 'Alright, here we are.' - In live kitchen. - I can't believe this! You see, a meal like this takes a lot of preparation. But fortunately, we've had so much time.. ...to prepare all this beautiful food. Isn't it lovely? Raw broccoli. Don't you just love the snap and crackle of that? Let's check on our golden goose. - 'It's your shot, Jerry.' - What? Well, it's not golden. But it's white. I think what's happened is.. ...the stove is broken. Don't you just hate that when that happens on the holidays? I tell you. Do you have any idea what it would cost to have a repairman come out here and fix this stove on Christmas? But never mind. Ha-ha. You came here to see me cook. I'm gonna cook for you. What is she doing? Why is she doing this to me? Did she just wake up this morning and decided "I think I'll kill my career on national television?" Oh! Oh! You know, folks, sometimes the best things in life are the simplest, you know? I mean, this is as good as it gets. - Christmas flapjacks. - 'Oh. boy.' - Excuse me? - Christmas flapjacks. Oh, a Blane tradition, you know? I have been cooking flapjacks for this family.. I've been cooking flapjacks for this family since I had this family. Oh, but wait. A knock at the door. Do you know who that is? That's our special guest Jefferson Jones.. Get the, get the cameraman out of the door. Clear the door, please. Cue the Mountie. '...who risked his life in a blizzard.' A blizzard, to save little Billy Futterman. Let's welcome him. Coming! Hey, Jeff! Come on in. Look at you! Whoa, love your hat. Wasn't my idea. 'Welcome to my kitchen, Jeff.' "No, I came all the way from Colorado." Oh, you did? Well, isn't that nice? "What's.." "What's that terrific smell?" - "A Christmas goose?" - No, not quite. - Not exactly. - "My favorite." Oh, I'm so glad. Oh, I'm, I'm just here making up flapjacks. My Christmas flapjacks, which is a tradition.. Why don't you just sit down over here and talk to me while I cook? "There's nothing better than a big family Christmas." That's right, Jefferson. That's why it's so nice to get together with people like you so you can catch up on everything that's been happening. Why don't you tell me about your home in Colorado? - It burned down. - Oh, that's right. It burned down. I forgot. How thoughtless of me. No wonder you're so confused. I'm confused? What the hell is she talking about? I've no idea what she's talking about. - 'Joel, go to commercial.' - Will you.. Someone please tell Ms. Blane to go to commercial! Got to commercial? Alright. Go to commercial. Cut. Oh, you know, this batter.. This batter looks wonderful. Why don't we take, uh, just a short break here? And when we come back we'll see how these flapjacks turn out. - And we're clear. - Alright, where's the food? Wait a minute. Don't anybody move. Just hold it. Where is the food? - Where is all the food? - 'We haven't seen it.' How am I supposed to.. The food's not done. Where is Josie? Josie! 'Josie wouldn't do this to me, she wouldn't leave me here.' No, I don't want the phone! Get out! You're fired! Wait. Get me some coffee, and then you're fired. Where is the food? Will somebody answer me? How am I supposed to go on? There is no cooked food! Aren't you supposed to cook it? You still don't get it, do you? Listen to me. My life is falling apart in front of millions of people on live television. In an hour, there's not gonna be any Elizabeth Blane. There's not gonna be.. Alex! Alex! Hey! We've had a few technical problems! - You're a pro! - Alex, you are insane! Now I want you to call this off right now. Alex? I thought his name was John. - Call it off now, Alex. - Listen to me. - I mean it. - Listen to me! I'm not gonna let you throw away 20 years of a good thing because some goose isn't cooked. I know you can do it. - I want you to call this... - Listen to me! I want you to go out there and be the real Elizabeth Blane. Do it! I invented you. 'This is prime time live.' If this works, there are specials, movies. We'll be rolling in everything. And we'll be able to do this together for the rest of our lives. Elizabeth, I want you to go out there and give me the real Elizabeth Blane. You're great. Do it. Do it. We're back in ten seconds. Places, people! '...what she's gonna do?' - 'Calm down. Calm down.' - 'Alright. Here we go.' Jefferson, when you quit your job to go live in the woods, were you scared? - Yeah, but it was worth it. - 'Everyone quiet.' - And we're back! Come on. Come on, babe. Just pull it together. That's all you gotta do. Just pull it together. Uh, I'm.. I've been told that the purpose of this program is to show you the real Elizabeth Blane and how she spends her Christmas. Well, the last place I would be is in the kitchen. So...follow me. 'Well, Joel, you could become a producer. I might as well..' 'What am I watching here? This is just..' 'Well, just tell me what to do, Joel. I don't know...' Whatever she's got.. Just, just wherever she goes. - I don't know! - Hurry up. Hurry up! Let's go. Keep the boom up. Make way for me. Excuse me. Well, here we are in my living room except this isn't my living room. This isn't even my house. Uh, you see, we're in Connecticut but I live in New York. You do? In fact, it isn't even snowing. Jeff, would you please show everyone at home what's behind curtain number.. Oh, you don't know what curtain number one is. 'That, that window over there. Pull back the curtain.' - What's she doing? - Listen, I have no idea. 'Take a look at this.' 'See? It's fake snow.' Alright. Go ahead. Thrill me. What's next? Actually, now what I'd like to do is, I'd like to introduce you to all the people who help make this possible. - Do something. - Okay? - Honey, look who's here. - Yes. - The carolers, at the door. - Oh. How lovely. This man over here is not my son-in-law. - 'Get out of my way.' - 'His name is Tyler.' Open that door! Alright, everybody in! In! Let's get dressed and get ready to sing! Look at that face. He's an actor. This is your moment, so show 'em what you can do, Tyler. Go ahead. You're on. 'You're all getting $12 apiece and your mother's getting..' Hi. I am available and seeking new representation. - What is he doing? - I can do romance. 'Oh, stand that shot. Yeah, that's good.' "Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand "that I might touch that cheek.. - He's .. He's, he's.. - It's okay, it's okay. - Is this acting? - Put your coats on. Put a smile on your face. Let me take a look at you. "The sounds of bones crunching in the moonlight.. "Keep me awake, awake.. Awake. Because I can't believe what I'm seeing! Because what I'm seeing is death. - Do you hear me? I'm seeing... - 'Excuse me, Joel.' What? Don't ever touch me! Don't ever touch me! Alright, everybody, get ready. Sing! Sing! ♪ Of holly ♪ Fa la la la la ♪ La la la la la ♪ La la la la la Let's go, everybody. This isn't my granddaughter. I mean, God forbid, at my age I should be a grandmother? 'Give me a break.' Come on in! The door is open! And this little guy over here that's not Kevin, that's Anthony. ♪ La la la la la la la la la ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ Louder! Come on, give it to me! 'This is a live set! You can't..' Carnegie Hall waits! I.. We just came to pick up the kids. Oh, great! This is too much. These people are the real parents of the baby and Kevin. - Mom! Dad! - No! And the tree's fallen over, of course. Of course! Why would it remain standing? Don't you worry about it. I hated this tree anyhow. This fake, old pink thing. I didn't like it. Oh, Norah, come and help! Jeff, where's our tree? We actually have a Christmas tree where we went out and cut one down. - Jeff.. - I hate that green tree. They're putting in that green tree. They got rid of the pink. 'Believe me, it all worked in the rehearsal.' 'I can't believe this.' - Josie! - 'Oh, here she is.' I'm sorry, Liz. No, Josie, don't be silly. - This is Josie. - Let me guess. - She's not her daughter. - And she is not my daughter. Okay? She's my assistant. I wanna tell you something. She's probably the best damn cook in the whole wide world. You know, all those wonderful dishes that everybody thinks I make.. ...this lady makes. Thanks, Josie. - Wow. So what have we got here? - We're done. - I mean, we've got fake snow. - No, you're done. - 'Fake house, fake Christmas.' - Oh, no. But the biggest fake of all is me. I'm really sorry. I never meant it to go this far. - 'I don't believe this.' - But you see? I can't cook. - What? - I'll kill you! I can't believe you, you're doing this to me! - The only thing I know how to.. - Stop! Don't go on! April fool. - No, it's not. - April fool, everybody. - It's not April fool. No. - No, no, it's not true. She's the greatest cook that ever was. She's lying. She's going off her head. Alex, it's over... She hasn't taken her medication. - Let go of her. - Hey, listen, Hee-haw... Ow! 'Mister Jefferson!' Hey! Alright, he punched him in the face! Ha-ha! Hey, hey, move in, move in, move in! Get a close up on that. I wanna see his bruise. I wanna see bleeding if there's any. Will you cut the cameras? Get away from me! It's over! Finished! My hero. Ha-ha! What have you done? This is a whole new kind of behavior from you. - Ha-ha-ha! - That's it! Alex, you're fired! You're fired! You're fired! You're fired! This is beautiful! Hey, you're fired! You're fired! Get out! Get out! You're fired! Everyone's fired. Now tell me, please he's not really your husband. I'm not married. Elizabeth, you're fired! You! I don't even know who you are, but you're fired. You're fired! Out of here, everyone! Get out! You're all fired! - Ha-ha-ha! - Out! Oh, yes. Move in, move in, move in! - You're sure? - I'm sure. - 'Hey!' - 'Aw!' That is.. That's what I want. Yes. - We regret to say that we are.. - What? They yanked us? I can't believe they cut us off! No! I can't believe you! Hm.. Well, cooking's really easy when you just follow the directions, isn't it? You could come practice your cooking in Colorado. Oh, I'd love to do that, but.. ...I'm, I'm just a city girl, really. Who's that? - Oh, no. - Elizabeth.. - Elizabeth, just hear me out. - Why? The ratings were unprecedented. The network has been flooded with calls. - Oh, no. - This is big! I fired you, Alex. Shut up! Elizabeth, you would be an important part of our television family. I'm not interested. I'm prepared to offer you twice what we paid you before. Won't you come in, Mr. Prescott? Didn't the other network offer you five times as much? - Five times? - That's right, five times. Alex, shut up. Elizabeth, at least consider the offer. If I were to consider doing television I'd have to do it on my own terms, Mr. Prescott. - No faking. - "No More Faking." - What a title for your book! - 'What book?' 'You know that "People Magazine" article?' That could be the outline. This could mean movies... - 'Alex.' - Series.. Alex.. - Shut up. - Shut up. Shut up. You know what, Mr. Prescott? We'll call you from Colorado. Jefferson's going to rebuild his house and I'm going to help him. Colorado? Colorado. - Bye-bye. - But wait. - I know I'm fired. - Nice knowing you.
