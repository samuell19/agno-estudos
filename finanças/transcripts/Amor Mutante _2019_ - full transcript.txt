We think that we are superior beings because we control our lives and feelings Buy we are deceiving ourselves, we are still primitive. We believe that we are free choosing what we breathe, eat and drink. But it's not like that. Mutant Love Months before Hey Jorge, I forgot something, I'll be back in a sec, please choose a good table. Hey. What's your name? Why would I give my name to a stranger? It depends on what you want: a friend for a day, a month, or a year. You can search for the list of singers on the bar's website, there you'll find my name I have to go. I'm very good at researching. Accept my friendship request in 10 minutes. My name is Genaro. where have you been don't run away Bellamy This is a very disturbing situation In only 2 weeks, this is the fourth body of an unidentified being found in Mexico City. Specialists declare that these beings are dying because they are not used to living in our environment. Because to live in our conditions they would have to evolve. We will keep reporting. Hello? Your name is beautiful, Ali! I would love to invite you to dinner tomorrow. Are you Genaro? You never give up, right? I'm a crazy psychopath, You'd better agree or tomorrow you'll have me knocking on your door to take you. You're freaking me out. Get to know me so you can see there's nothing to fear. Okay, let me think... Let's meet tomorrow at the "Bellini Restaurant", at 9pm. I'll be there. Ok You look beautiful! Thank you Do you always dress like that for dinner? No, only when they take me to the city ́s most expensive restaurant. Spending all my paycheck is worth it, if I can get to know you. Shall we order? Yes please, I feel like having the ribe eye steak with lobster and shrimps. That's why I say it's worth my paycheck So, did you want to be a singer since you were a kid? Yes, I'm currently saving to produce my demo I've got a meeting with Jolly Records, where they want to hear me sing. When my parents died 3 years ago, I promised myself to do everything that I love and not waste my time. Now tell me, how did you get my number? I work at "Work Empire", I'm a headhunter, and I'm in charge of recruiting people that's why I have access to their personal information Isn't it illegal to use it to seduce your victims? I thought you had different abilities. I also have different abilities. Oh really, What else can you do? I'm a dog trainer! I can dominate any dog. So you're their Alpha dog. And how do you do it? I need a dog to show you. I believe that a good dog trainer doesn't need a dog to prove that he's a good dog trainer You're right. Quiet sit jump well done now the paw now attack! Ali, why do you smoke so much if you're a singer? Singers also have bad habits, anxieties, nerves. Since when don't you smoke? I realized how much money I was spending and decided to save it. And what did you do with your savings? Actually, the smell bothered my ex-girlfriend, it irritated her throat So I quit gradually You have a lot of willpower. It was the opposite for me, I started smoking because all my ex-boyfriends smoked, And working in a bar, surrounded by smoke, it's inevitable to smoke. Do you want to go for a coffee? Let's go Do you believe in what the news says about the aliens? Do you think they've been coming to visit us for so many years, without trying to conquer the planet? I don't think so. I think they're here to do an anthropological study, and like a biologist, they simply come to analyze us. If they really reached us, after traveling for millions of light years, I think they would be invasive and would try to repress us to prove that they are a superior species, Perhaps they would kill us and try to impose their customs including their Gods as in any conquest. I believe that being a superior species they wouldn't come looking for war, perhaps on their planet they have a very clear idea of the concepts of love and peace and as a biologist who studies a new habitat, they simply observe how we live. Well, they would be taking a big risk, because humans, wouldn't hesitate to subject them to analysis and torture for research. What about the alien bodies that are appearing in the city? It must be a distraction so that we focus on that, and build the terror for things that don't belong to the planet, such as the aliens, instead of focusing on what is part of us, like the bad government, which is worse. Or perhaps, in the very distant future traveling in time is already possible, and in reality it's humans who are traveling back in time to see how we lived in the past, that is why they are different but have humanoid features. Crazy I've gone crazy, right? But, I like it Are you okay? Calm down, breathe. Are you ok? Yes, don't worry, The coffee gave me heartburn. Tomorrow I'm going to bring some tea, my mom used to give me when I was a kid It's a mixture of herbs, but it's very good. Do you have your professional license? Yes, I have it It says here that you have 4 years of experience That's right! Perfect Brenda, that would be all for now we will get back to you. Thank you. Thank you very much see you soon. I hope so. Honey, I finished work early to see you. Okay my love, I'll see you soon. I'll meet you outside the cinema. Okay, bye My love, Hey my love sorry I'm late. How are you? Any news? You know, same same, Pure subjective truths. What of all this do we know if it's really true? Come on I didn't like the movie Can you spare any change? No, sorry. You! You have the devil inside you, you are the devil, pure evil, you will burn in hell! Get away from her boy, Save yourself! I think she was telling the truth what are you talking I am very evil, and you must save yourself ... Before I smother you with kisses! Ali, Truth or Dare? Truth What's your favorite sex position? Why does everyone ask sexual questions at the first chance, instead of discovering them! My favorite is one that I call "Caveman at the cliff". Sounds interesting. Truth or Dare? Truth Tell me... what you would change about your past? Is there something you regret? Actually I don't regret anything, I consider everything a lesson, and one more experience, but maybe drinking so much and the number of ex-girlfriends that I had. Oh, so you were an alcoholic womanizer. something like that. Ali, Truth or Dare? Dare Tell me how much is +15 x12 /22.5 If you don't know... you must take off your clothes. You know I'm really bad at math. That's cheating! I have no idea. I said all of your clothes! You didn't specify underwear Truth or Dare? Dare Tell me the name of my favorite singer. Otherwise, you'll dance for me completely naked. I've forgotten... You're vengeful! You've earned it. Good morning beautiful, I'm leaving in a rush because I have to pick up my suit. You make yourself beautiful for to night. Why?, Where are you taking me? To have some fun I made you some tea, it's the one of the rare herbs. You drink it. Are you okay? Yes Do you want me to take you to the emergency room? Don't overreact, I'm fine, I just need some rest and tomorrow I'll be as good as new, okay? I'm going to stay here to take care of you. No, not today, today I'd rather sleep alone. Tomorrow night I sing at the bar. Will I see you there? I will be there, in the front row, honey. Everything has a beginning and an end, but I don't want to wake up from this dream, because you are my light, because you are my peace, because you've been everything I wanted to wait for, because... I don't get used to the world if you're not here. And the smell of your body, your way of speaking, in your bad moments the excuses you give, make me smile, make me sigh, captivate me more. I'm the luckiest man in the bar And I'm the luckiest girl in the world Guess what? What.. I told my mom that I have a wonderful girlfriend. Oh thank you very much She said she wants to meet you What if you just show her a picture of me, and that's it? I already did that, she's expecting us for dinner tomorrow. Just because I'm curious to meet the queen who raised my prince and so she can see what good taste her son has. I'm sure she'll like you, but if she says something that bothers you, just ignore her, sometimes she makes strange jokes. Then I'll better laugh. Hello! I'm glad you came to visit me Gena, you brought a friend. Mom, she's my girlfriend, I'd already told you. You look prettier in the photos. Just kidding, I didn't think Gena could get such a pretty girlfriend. Nice to meet you ma'am, Genaro has told me many good things about you. He couldn't tell you anything bad. Come in, I've been cooking all day, You like tripe soup, right Ali? eeh, yes Mom, I told you to cook something light I removed all the fat, son. Don't worry, I can eat anything. Well, I don't think you eat much, look how skinny you are! It's my complexion, I inherited it from my father. I would love to meet your parents, one day you should bring them to lunch. That won't be possible, they died 3 years ago. I'm so sorry, Was it due to some illness? No, they killed each other. What!? A car accident, while we were driving they were arguing, then the car overturned and only I survived. But then it was an accident, why would you say they killed each other? Because they were arguing, they shouldn't have, They also hated each other, they achieved their goal. Can we stop talking about sad things, Mom, Ali is a singer. So that's what you do, you just sing? yes And how are you supposed to provide for my grandchildren? We are not very sure we want children... it's too early to... And I don't think you can conceive with that body, I'll serve you a little more soup, I don't want more, really, thank you very much. And you can have another tortilla. Mom, she's doing very well singing, she's one of the few people who can say that she does what she loves to do. I already have a demo with songs that I wrote, and I'm going to audition for a record company at the bar where I sing. Okay ... we'll have to hear you sing. Excuse me, where is the restroom? Son, I don't like the way your girlfriend dresses. She's very eccentric, You could have problems in the street because of her. Well, I like it. And where did you meet her? a table dance club, for sure.? She's my girlfriend so please respect her. Besides she's an orphan, she must have many traumas. Be careful son. Better for me, I won ́t have uncomfortable parents in law. What are you suggesting? You're a very good cook , ma'am. Can you cook? Did your mom have enough time to teach you? Well, I know how to cook some things, but I usually buy frozen or canned food, it doesn't taste bad. I'll have to teach you, you won't give my son that kind of food. I don't have a problem with that. Your ex-girlfriend Carlita was a very good cook, and came from a very Catholic family. What's your religion Ali? Do you believe in God? Actually no, I do not believe in any deity, I only believe in nature, in life and death. Yes, it's good to have different points of view. Your parents probably didn't speak to you about God, either. I have a Bible that I'll give you... I have read the Bible, but I think that religion is a mockery, created to manipulate, to earn power and make money. Does someone want dessert?, it looks delicious! Is it a three milk cake, Mom? Gena, you fell in love with a heretic! Ma'am, Religion is a business that has caused a lot of death, torture and wars ... Well, Christ is a way of life and He will always be there when you need Him. So nobody wants dessert? Well, if God made me an atheist, why would you question His great wisdom? Okay, I think it's time to go. Ay Gena, See you soon, ma'am. Come more often. God bless you. And you too. Wait! Why didn't you stand up for me? I told you that you should ignore her. You should have tried her dessert. Is that how she treated all your girlfriends? I'm going to live with you, you're going to be my family, and she will have to understand it. Besides, the debate was great. You're a bad boyfriend "Gena" Are you okay? Tell me it was the tripe soup and not my kiss. Please don't tell your mother about this. Let's go before she comes out. What a bunch of lunatics, they don't even know what they're welcoming. If we are really being invaded by these beings, the question would be: what do they want or what are they waiting for? I was going to join them, I've got the banner back there, If they feel they're welcome, maybe they will be friendly. You're crazy. Truth or Dare Dare Let's get into the shower right now Really? Do you feel that stinky? Do you want the last taco? No, it's all yours. I want to go to sleep now. You'd better go home. I'm not leaving, you're very pale, you look almost gray. Don't worry about me, you can go. Are you ok? This tea will make you feel better But I told you I don't feel sick. Just have a sip. Ali, do you think you're pregnant? That's impossible, we've taken precautions. Have you suffered from heart, liver or kidney disease, mental illness, seizures? Ali, you must eat better, you have low pressure Am I pregnant? Fortunately, no, a baby would be born very weak But I'm going to prescribe some supplements. But I eat very well, doctor. It's not what your body tells us. Let's buy red, sweet and mole tamales, Beans with chorizo. and mashed potatoes, potatoes, of course Some bowls, looks good. Guess what I want? What? I want to cook for you Really? Today I want to cook and surprise you. What are you going to do? It's a surprise. we need... peppers onion, do we need? yes, but not that one, that's sweet, Well, as you know the recipe, you'd better choose the vegetables. in other bag it's evident that you don't cook nothing will happen! For the special recipe, that I'm going to made We need some meat. What kind? It will be delicious my love, your cooking is delicious. I'm so lucky, I found a chef. Why didn't you ever tell me that you knew how to cook so well? I wanted to reserve some surprises. I open this Let me do it, today I want to pamper you. Did you like it? It is delicious, my love. If you want... I can cook for you always Do you think I need someone to cook for me? Are you calling me useless or what? What? You didn't even let me help you. I won't let you to come with your arrogance and offend me because I don't know how to Cook. I'm not even hungry and it's not so good! Get out of my house. What's wrong with you? Get out of here! Rocco! How are you? I neglected you for so long, right? Let's to eat. Yes? My love how are you? You left without saying goodbye. Without saying goodbye? Oh, well, I won't interrupt you. What are you doing? I'm browsing the Internet. Oh, well, I won't interrupt you. Are you coming to lunch tomorrow...? I'd rather see you on Sunday. Okay, Sunday it is. Take it easy, goodbye. I think we exaggerated, we bought a lot. Bon appetite neighbor. Your cat ran away again. Sorry, thank you, how are your sales doing? Pretty good Well, have a good day Regina. Ciao, Take care of the cat! Where did you go? Is the neighbor your friend? No, she's an envious lady, but she's my only neighbor. I think she envies me because my parents left me the apartment, and I don't have to worry about the rent, Maybe it's that. on purpose, your parents, do you think they're somewhere in heaven? I don't know what to think, maybe, they reincarnated, or now they are somewhere in the universe. I love the universe Yes, it's amazing. Did you know that if we imagine that the sun is the size of a leukocyte, the size of our galaxy would be equivalent to the size of Latin America? And did you know that if the Earth were this, I mean if all this apartment were the Earth, the moon would be 20 km away. There are so many things that we know and so many others that we will never know. You are very intelligent, I love talking with you. And what were you reading the other day that you didn't answer my messages? Ali, Actually, I was looking for information about your symptoms Your cell phone is ringing, why don't you answer? It's probably the bank. Hello? Hello, am I speaking to Genaro Muñoz?. Yes, who's speaking? Sorry for calling you, I'm Brenda Gonzalez. Last week I went to an interview with you and I want to know if you've decided something. Yes, next week my partner will choose someone. Okay, I'll be waiting for your answer. Thank you Why is this Brenda calling you? How did she get your number? I don't know. I interview many people every day. Well, it's not ethical that people call you and even less so on a Sunday. I'm going to block her number. Maybe she's obsessed with me. I'm not kidding, Genaro. They're just people desperate to get a job. Yes, and therefore they must be willing to do whatever it takes to get it ... But I'm in love with you. You probably flirt with all of them, plus you have all her information. Calm down, I've never given you reasons to distrust me. Don't tell me to calm down. Why does she call you?! This is why my friends told me, never tell your girlfriend to "calm down" because it's like saying "Satan, I invoke you". Don't be stupid. I even like your jealous fits. What's wrong with you? Nothing Tell me what's wrong? Nothing at all. Ali, What did you do?! You can't hurt yourself like that! NO, You did it to me That's women for you, the first months they give you their cute version, but then they become wild beasts. Yes I know, it's happened to me, but I thought Ali was different. Maybe she had her period. That hormone business, is inevitable. Lately she has very crazy reactions I don't know what to do anymore. That's why we say we don't have to understand women, We just have to love them. Women are very easy to understand, they are like an open book, a quantum physics book written in Japanese, but open. Well, if you no longer feel that relationship works it's best to leave it for peace. No, of course I want to stay with her, we've been very happy but her strange mood swings... Yesterday she was so angry that she pulled out a fingernail, I don't know. Disgusting! No shit, she was very angry. Nails are the most precious thing for women. I believe that any argument can be sorted out with sex. Try it, you have nothing to lose.. Go out for dinner, do something fun, You know what makes your girlfriend happy. Honey, you look beautiful! My love, you don't have to do this to make me happy. I want to do it. We came here for our first date, our first kiss And I want us to be happy as we were before. That day I invited you here because I thought you were a clown, wanting to hook up with every girl he met, and I wanted to bother you by making you spend a lot of money. Let's go somewhere else, it's on me. Wait You were right. Nothing is more delicious than this. Yes, super delicious, I was almost vegetarian when I lived with my parents. But since I'm alone I eat a lot of junk food. Well, apart from the delicious tacos. I can see that, huh? I'm lucky not to gain weight. It's curious, What, we're both only children. No siblings. Sorry, I lied to you. And in my previous job I managed to increase sales by 70% And how did you achieve that? We changed the way we communicated with the client. And what are your areas of opportunity? I try to use every opportunity as achance to grow... Michelle, Thank You, I will send you an email to tell you what's next. Thank You. You should try to relax. I don't know what's happening to your voice, but if you want you can stay for 10 more minutes. I need you to correct me I'm going to audition with the most important record company in Mexico. And this simple thing is not coming out. When you come back I'll do it perfectly. Ali, I think that's enough, you've been vocalizing for a long time. It's best if you come back tomorrow and we can go through your songs. I think your class is no longer working for me; I'm going to look for another teacher. Are you Okay? I'm sure he's going to leave her for me, I almost achieve that. You're a marriage destroyer If you saw him, he's so handsome, and his wife so ugly. How's your diabetes treatment? You shouldn't smoke! We're all going to die of something, right...? Thanks for coming, I've got very strange symptoms, I don't know what's wrong with me. Have you seen the doctor? Yeah, but she just gave me a checkup and she prescribed supplements. I don't want to stir up trouble but... how well do you know Genaro? Genaro is my boyfriend, obviously I know him well. But you don't know how many sexual partners he had before you. He's quiet, just like me. Yeah, but we all have a past. Have you told him what's happening to you? I don't want to tell him everything. He only knows what he has seen. Well, if he's your boyfriend, he should know everything, and he should go with you to the doctor. It makes me very embarrassed, Regina. Buy, buy one, the novelty doll, for boy or girl Buy, buy one, sir, No, thank you come on my friend! We have to see it as something funny, Don't tell me we're going to believe that the aliens are here. We don't know that. Honey, I'm here, how are you? I don't feel very well Why are you smoking?! You have the audition with the record company. You have to take care of your throat. What's wrong with you? your voice! Can I ask you something? Would you mind if we go to the doctor together? No, let's go. What's wrong? You told me you used to booze all the time and had a bunch of ex-girlfriends, so I don't know with how many you've slept with! I think you've given me something contagious. What are you talking about? I'm fine. You also had your relationships. Being a singer gives you many fans, right? Okay. Just leave, I'll go alone tomorrow. It looks pretty healthy, I don't see any anomaly. Do I have an STD? It doesn't seem like it, your test results are good. Just a question, do you drink or smoke? Just occasionally. Try not to do it, and improve your diet. I will prescribe 3 ovules, and you will apply one night. Ok. Okay. My love, are you busy? sorry for how I behaved yesterday. Can we see each other today? Let me make you dinner. Please, I owe you one, do your best to come. Did it hurt? No, it was just embarrassing to lie there with open legs in front of a stranger. But no need to worry. How was your day? Very good, Ali, don't hold the pot without the cloth, it's boiling! I didn't feel How come you didn't feel it? I didn't feel a thing. You're losing sensitivity. When do you sing? They haven't confirmed, I'll check on the bar's website. You'll have to sing with gloves on. I look beautiful, right? Very beautiful How come they don't expect me to fill that bar? If you continue being so careless, I'll have to tell my mom to come to take care of you. Anything but that. Drink the tea I made for you. Thank you My love, can I ask you a huge favor...? Yes I have to introduce an ovule ... through my vagina ... for 3 nights... And I can't. Don't worry, I'll help you. How deep should it go in? As deep as possible. Why haven't they invented something else? don't worry I help you ready My love, would you turn on the TV for me? Of course Damages caused by pollution, transgenic organisms and pesticides, are altering food. We still don't know for sure their effects on the human body, but the damages are definitely irreversible. Babies with deformities will start to be born... There will be genetic mutations... It will be a much more sensitive generation regarding the senses the senses will be more exponential My love, I don't know what happened. My hands are fine! Yes, I removed the bandages, I don't have blisters, they're not even reddened. Calm down, maybe the ointment is very good, Or the burn was superficial, I'm in an interview, I'll call you back in a while. Okay, Bye Sorry... Brenda I confirm you passed the psychometric tests Great. By the way... thank you for answering my call on Sunday. It was you! Yes You caused me a problem with my girlfriend. It's her fault then, for being so insecure. Is she as pretty as I am? I will send you an email confirming the next test. Genaro, let me invite you to dinner tonight at my place. I would like you to explain the selection process tests and all those things. My schedule is very busy. But thank you. Well, think about it, See you soon. My love, can you believe this?! And how do you feel? Happy now that you're here. Ali, wait! Not now Why, what's wrong? I'm very tired, it was a busy day and I still need to write a report for tomorrow. I have to go. Do you need help with your ovule? No! I can do it myself. Excuse me, sir., Can I change the destination on the app? I knew you would come. I'll just help you with the test answers and I'll leave. Come in And the answers are? Actually they are very easy: the first three answers are A, the next two are B and the third is C. Tell me something about you, how long have you been working there? Four years, and two promotions. And what do you like to do? I like to go to the movies, go dancing, the park and the universe. The universe? Genaro, Do you believe in the alien invasion? Yes, Did you know that if we imagine that the sun is the size of a leukocyte, the size of our galaxy would be equivalent to the size of Latin America... You are very cute Who cares about silly facts? Let's live in the moment. That's why we're here. Brenda, I have a girlfriend and I love her. Well, I don't believe you love her that much, for a reason. Yes, I love her. "I finished the report, sorry for leaving, I love you, Ali." come in Are you ok? Yes, sit down. My love! Why do you smell like of woman perfume? Darling, how can you smell me from there? You're in the bathroom, it must be your air freshener. Yes, it's you, with woman perfume. Yesterday when I said goodbye to some friends at work, one of them hugged me. Her perfume probably permeated my suit. That's weird. What's weird are lips that red in the morning. I want to look pretty for you, I want to be what I was like when you met me. I'm itchy all over my body. It doesn't stop. Get dressed, I'll take you to the doctor. I'm not going to work today. Go and get dressed! Have you been very worried lately? No, nothing rare I'm asking because, after the check-up, you don't present pathologies, What you have is an anxiety fit, nervousness and stress. Nervousness and stress? Caused by what? Well, it can be anything, lately I've seen many patients with your symptoms. The news shows us terrible things, toxic food, the discovery of alien bodies... All this causes stress. Doctor, that ́s impossible, she has very strange symptoms. Could you prescribe her something? The only thing that I can recommend is for you to relax. No, no, Let's go Ali, This can't be possible. I don't feel good enough to go to the cinema, We won't solve anything in the next two hours. And if the doctor is right, and my feelings are making me sick? Not everything is mental. I started to feel sick when we began our relationship, maybe you stress me out. You should say that we're going to overcome this. Whatever it it, I wouldn't want to pass it on to you. I think it's best for you to stay away from me, I want to take care of you no, at least for a while until I'm back to normal. I don't want you to feel you have to stick around. Hi, Genaro! How are you? Thank you very much for the test answers. Let me introduce you to my girlfriend, Ali. That's the perfume you smelled of! Ali, let go of her! Let go of her! I'm your ex-girlfriend, idiot! What's wrong with your girlfriend?!, Is She crazy, is she a lesbian or what? I don't know Both of you are insane. Do you want to be my girlfriend again? And the love of my life forever? I love you Genaro. Do you believe in fate? I don't think that everything is coincidence, I believe there is a force bigger than us that is gradually directing us to where we need to go. Definitely things happen for a reason. Like the day we met, I was at a very boring party with my friends, and we decided to continue the party at a nearby bar. How lucky that the party was boring, That's how I met you, We could say the universe conspired so we could meet each other that night. Are you still following your ovule treatment? Yes, but I put it in myself before you arrived. And how long do we have to wait for... Only a week, It's going to be forever. it'll go fast. Honey... What? I'm hungry, I'm going to eat something. Do you want something? Don't eat so much. Don't eat all the cheese and the biscuits. No, I'm just drinking milk Liar, I can hear you chew the biscuits and can smell the cheese What am I holding now? The ham And now? Jelly Ali, something very strange is happening to your senses. What? Hello? Good morning Genaro, This is Mr. Roberto speaking Good morning, sir. I'm calling to remind you that if you're late one more time you'll be fired. The day you didn't turn up will be doubly deducted, unless you bring written proof. Sure, sir. I'm sorry, my girlfriend was feeling sick, that's what happened You're a very good asset, but this can't happen again. I remind you that check-in is at 9 o'clock. Of course. I 'm on my way Sorry for the warning. Are they going to deduct a lot from your paycheck? It was Jorge, he wanted to ask me if I wanted a tamale. I heard everything, it was your angry boss. And you're going to be late again. Don't worry, today I'll fix it. Today, you'll be auditioning for the record company. Yes! I'm very excited and nervous too. You'll surprise them. I hope so. We're still are on time, The end of the world is coming, The aliens are more and more, It's the arrival of Satan, the end of the world is close, aliens are among us, and they're more and more, Repent! Repent, we're still on time. You can save yourself, This is a punishment from God. Why didn't you go to your audition? Go away, go and live your life. I don't have a life any more and I don't want to mess up yours. Let's go outside, breathe, and tell me what happened. I don't want to go outside! The whole city stinks of death, and all those noises... I can't take it. Calm down, breathe. My friend... I brought you some cookies, Have you had breakfast? I think so. Your eyes are puffy. Have you slept well? I haven't slept for days, Why don't you listen to your music, and sing. It will make you feel better. I threw my music away, Regina. It doesn't help me at all. Did you break up with Genaro? I asked him not to come here anymore. Watch TV for a while, it will distract you. No, it's all about robberies, looting, torture, deformed babies, toxic food and Ali Sorry, I know it's not the best timing, I'm actually here to tell you that a moment ago my mom said she saw how your cat was run over. Sorry, I know that Bellamy was your companion, but you can easily adopt another one ... I have to go, see you later. I suggest you find out if she inherited a disease from her parents, or if she has a relative who may have the same symptoms. Mom, I'm not going to leave her if she has some hereditary condition. I'm not a coward. She's going through a difficult situation and I won't abandon her. Well, take care, son, please. You too Hi! You're Genaro, right? I've seen you with Ali. Yes, she's my girlfriend. She doesn't look well, She vomits, doesn't eat, doesn't go out, If you really love her, you should take her to the doctor. Thanks for your concern. You're so sweet. I would love to have someone who did something like that for me. Bye Honey? How are you? I brought you a little gift. You want to hook up with her, right? You like Regina, the bitch. What are you talking about?, your neighbor and I are simply concerned about you. I'm alone, I have no one, no music, no parents, no cat! What do you mean "no cat"? That bitch told me she saw how it was run over. You have me, you can always count on me. And you have your brother, why don't you call him? He blames me for the death of our parents. He said that I could have prevented it. But that was an accident! He never got over it. He went to live to LA and he never spoke to me again. You should contact him, he may have the same symptoms you have. The problem might be hereditary. I don't care. I haven't seen him in 3 years, maybe he's in drugs or he's worse than me. At least you have a brother, I would have liked to have one. And your parents were together, while mine... My dad abandoned us when I was born, because he didn't want the responsibility And then my mom got sick, she was cured when she took shelter in religion. And you Ali... don't keep the only family you have away. 7 days later I'm going to take a quick shower, to go to work. Did you rest? Not much. There's no water. Did they say they were going to interrupt the service? Did you pay the bill? I think so. You think so?! Reporting from Mexico City, another strange body was found in a hotel, very much resembling an alien. It's already been sent to the lab and is being analyzed. We are with specialist Enrique Moreno to talk more about this subject. Necessary research is being carried out. It's important to understand where these beings come from because we share with them an important genetic percentage. Some theories suppose that they're probably people from the future, who somehow evolved and are traveling to the past. But they're definitely terrestrial beings. We will continue with this information later. On other news, there will be water shortage during the week in many districts, Take your precautions. I'll have to go to the office all stinky. The good thing is that nobody has your sense of smell. Everyone is killing each other. They hurt each other. There is fear, suffering and pain. People have lost hope. Ali, we have rotten food.

I've been asked to fire you. I don't want that because you're one of my best elements, but I've had reports that you're always in a bad mood and you're rude. We can't give that image. I've had many worries. However, I always finish my work. I'm sorry, I warned you. Leave the keys to your desk, for the girl who's going to take your place. You mean you already have my replacement? Yes, Brenda González, I don't know how she passed the exam, cheating I guess. I hope she will be as efficient as you were. Here you are, I won't need them anymore. What happened? They fired me. I told you I would ruin your life. I was already bored, Any way with the settlement they gave me we can live for a while without worries. I have the insurance money from my parents and some savings. Here we don't have to pay rent, bring your things. Weren't you going to record your album with your savings? Not anymore, I think I lost my voice ... You're not hungry anymore? No, My back hurts. It's probably tension. 21 days later Does it hurt a lot? A bit. What will we do without water? I don't know, I hope they restore the service in less than 24 hours. Lie down, I'll give you a back massage. That's right, it's my girlfriend... ...her back is rough and gray. What do you mean you don't have any appointments? For the next 2 months? No, no! By then I don't know how she'll be. Thanks, I'll call later. What's with the day? It's strangely cloudy. It seems normal to me. The sun has come out. Let's to breakfast. I'm not hungry at all. You have to eat. This egg is gray and the chicken ... What do you mean gray? At least drink the tea I made for you. Ali Are you ok? Why haven't I ever seen you drink that tea? Because I'm fine. I don't want you to give it to me again. 32 days later What's wrong with you, what are you trying to do? Something's wrong with the TV colors. This crap doesn't work anymore! What color is this shirt? Gray This? Purple This? Brown This? White What do you mean white?, It's the one in the photo. It's blue with green, look at this... Son, you're very foolish. You should get a different girlfriend. Mom, I told you, I love Ali, I'll never find someone like her. Because of her, you quit your job, right? To take care of her. I hope that she'll be fine. She's seen several doctors. We'll find the right one, one that will give her the right diagnosis... and medication., She'll be fine. I wish your dad had treated me like that, the way you treat that girl. And how is Rocco? Don't forget to feed him. Yes, don't worry, I take good care of your dog. Thank you You haven't eaten all day, Do you have a headache? Do you want us to go out for tacos? No, my back hurts a lot, I feel very weird, I'm not hungry or thirsty. Is the TV better like this? Yes, it's better in black and white. Sorry for not being able to fulfill your fantasies. All I want is to hug you and to be together. Hello! Hello Genaro. Sorry, I never asked your name. My name is Regina. How's Ali? I haven't seen her for weeks. The truth is she's getting worse. Doctors say it's emotional, but I think she has something more serious. If you need help, please let me know. You only have to knock at my door. Thank you Regina. You know perfectly well that her name is Regina, the bitch. What's wrong with you? She just greeted me and asked after you. If you want to, just go of with her. She can go out, and walk and fuck with you! I'm not liking your attitude, I'm doing everything for you! Nobody asked you to. I want you to be fine, for fuck's sake! Do you feel responsible, or is it just to oppose your mother who wants you to leave me! Calm down, you don't understand a thing! Well tell me then! Because now I'm horrible, I'm not the Ali that you fell in love with, I'm frightening, and I'm sick, like you told that fucking bitch. Why Genaro, why? 14 days later Hi, who is? Francisco, Fran, is that you? Ali? Yes, it's me, How did you find me? That doesn't matter, I wanted to know how's your health, I haven't heard from you in a long time. My health? You'd better ask if you're already an aunt! I'm an aunt now? Yes! I have a baby, she's almost 2 years old. She reminds me a lot of you, she has your expressions. So you're fine? When are you coming to Mexico? I don't know, my wife doesn't want to, the news doesn't help, Have you come across a dead alien? No, I don't go out much. All that invasion business is scary, right? Or is it the government putting off tourism? Maybe it wants to prevent reproduction, Who would want to have children in these circumstances?. Ali, you sound like mom. And you like dad. Do you miss them? Very much, they will never meet my baby. They never knew what it is to be grandparents, or have anyone to play with, or have anyone to visit, or take to the park. They won't stand up for them when you scold them we won't have anyone to ask for advice. Do you want to know my baby's name? Yes. I named her Ali, in honor of her aunt. I thought I would never see you again. Don't disappear, I'll be here so we can talk more often. I would like to introduce you to my wife. Yes. I'll introduce you to my boyfriend next time we talk. Take care, Ali. Yes, I.... Bye, Fran. 9 days later Calm down, nobody will come in, I'm here with you. 5 days later My love, What do you miss the most about us? I miss... going out together, eating, laughing, making love. All that will be a nice memory for you Won't we do all that anymore? If I ask you to do something for me, will you do it? Of course whatever you want. I want you to ... help me ... I don't want to live anymore. What?!, what are you talking about?! Why are you so selfish and don't think about me? How do you think that makes me feel?! because I think of you you'll be better without me No, no, you and I are going to be the family we never had. understood! What's wrong? You were choking. Let's go, I'm going to take you to the ER. No, doctors are going to say that I'm very stressed, and worried and that's the truth. But this has never happened to you before. Go to sleep. If it happens again we'll go, who cares? Ali, what did you do? what did you try to do?! Don't touch yourself. What happened? I heard screams. She got worse last night, I'm going to take her to the doctor. If you want, I'll come with you? No! She is no longer thirsty, she has no appetite, and her hair falls off by strands. Something strange happened with my sense of smell, my hearing and vision, too. You use your long-distance smell, your hearing has sharpened and you no longer distinguish colors. Yes, how do you know that? I have a sweet in my hand, what flavor is it? Mint. What flavor is the chewing gum that I put in my mouth? Berry What flavor is my drink? Apple As I imagined, We're going to have to hospitalize her, We're going to do some tests to find out the cause of her condition. You can't hospitalize me, I feel better than ever. You're a danger to everyone around you. what do you mean a danger? That's right, she's a danger. Ali, no, let him go! let him go! Ali, No! What did you do to him?! Can you wait for a moment?, I would like the specialist to check you. Everything is going to be okay. The doctor just went to get the specialist... She... she has all the symptoms, I just confirmed them. We have to hospitalize her to do some tests. She's going to die. It's best that she dies here, and then the hospital will take care of disappearing the body. Nobody living near her should see what's going to happen to her. We must get out of here. But the Doctor ... We must get out of here! Quickly! Run! Run, quickly! What did the doctor say? What did you hear? Something terrible will happen to me, my love. What's she doing here? She sould be in the hospital! Get out of here, it's none of your business I know it was your mother who killed my cat. Ali, you're very sick, you need treatment, if you get worse ... If I get worse, you can keep him. That's what you want, don't you?! You'd better leave, you're upsetting her. You are stupid, you don't realize what is happening to people ... Genaro, she could infect us with something terrible and then ... Ali, let her go! what did you do to her?! What are you doing? Cleaning your mess! don't touch her! She was diabetic. Right? If I take her to her apartment her mother will think that she had a seizure. Lock yourself in the damn room! 27 days later Ali, you've been watching that for a long time, don't torture yourself anymore. No, don't come near me, don't come! Why? Would you love me as much if I were different? What do you mean different? Did you know that there are more than 100 billion galaxies in the universe? How fortunate we were to meet, on this planet, among so many people. I would like to go back in time, and return to that bar when we met. 2 days later What are you doing here?
