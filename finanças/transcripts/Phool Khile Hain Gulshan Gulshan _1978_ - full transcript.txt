But why that urgent call? Grandpa? I'm calling from Hotel Hamilton. Vishal's with me. Make sure that he doesn't drink and is back on time.

Grandpa! Grandpa! Indecent, shameless! How could you do that? You're a bad name to us. Don't you dare raise a hand on our friend! It's your filthy company that has spoilt him. I feel like strangling you, It would've been better if you were dead. Old man, what's the speech for? Go back to your village if you're ashamed of Vishal's habits, ..we don't need you here. I had to hear this because of you! Let's go. Let's go. Please forgive me, That was my mistake. I was overcome by the desire to change him. I've put you in distress. I could never imagine this. Forget it grandpa. How can I? I've to get punished for this, I made a mistake. - No, don't say that I'm burdened by your favours. Today, whatever I am, is because of your grace, ..after my father's death, you've supported me like your own. That's alright, but.. Whatever've achieved is, ..not as valuable as your tears. I regret that I failed in improving Vishal. It's not humanly possible. He'll change with time. I don't have enough time. He's shattered the dream I came here with. I can neither go back nor live here now. I don't understand, what should I do. Gentlemen, you must have read the contract papers, I've agreed to their demand in principle. I had a discussion with Marshal and Company, ..we have to send them a reply at the earliest. Any objections? Excuse me sir. - Yes? An urgent phone call from your house. Hello. - Grandpa has just arrived and is very worried. He is talking crazy in his worryness. He says that he can't live here anymore. Please come home as soon as possible. - Alright. Sun and Sands Hotel? Is Mr. Laxminarayan's son Mr. Vishal there? No? Alright. Vishal? Vishal.. Vishal.. Vishal? Any information about Vishal? Nurse, get the injection. Please come in Mr. Verma. Mr. Vishal, meet Mr. Verma, the solicitor of our company. Your father always considered his opinion regarding business matters. Glad to meet you. Mr. Vishal, I'm sorry for your loss. Please sit down. Your father drafted a will before his death. We can talk about the will later. No, I'd rather read it out in front of your managers, ..and directors right now. Okay. - Send them out. Let's go. - Please. You mean us? Alright. We don't care. Old man, don't mind. As per this will, ..you are deprived of his entire business, properties, The bungalow in this city, Darjeeling, Shimla, ..and bank balance. You have been evicted from all the properties. What? But I'm his only son? But you'll have to accept either of the two conditions, ..in the will to inherit this. Tell me. The first condition is that you'll have to marry Shalini. After which each of you will get half the property. Who the hell is she? I'll not marry her! What has she got to do with my family? - Patience please. These are your father's words. There is a second option, if you disagree to marry her. He has three acres of land in his village. If you can farm for a year on that land, ..you can inherit everything. Rs 50,000 will be deposited with Verma and Solicitors, ..which you will use to buy a tractor, seeds, ..and for your daily needs for a year. If you refuse both the conditions, Shalini will inherit everything. How can I marry an ordinary secretary or plough the fields? If I don't accept these conditions willI be a paper? This is injustice, it's totally wrong. Shalini has planned this all! - Exactly! What do you mean? How are you related to my family? Mr. Vishal, this is a school, not, ..your bar where you speak your mind I don't want a rogue like you to even come near these kids. Come this way. You're no better! You misled my father, ..and got the properties transferred in your name! What nonsense? Stop acting innocent! My father's will reads, ..that I can inherit half of his properties only if I marry you, Even then the rest goes to you. How dare you think I'll ever marry a nanny like yourself? Mr. Vishal! Hold your tongue, ..forget about marrying you, I can't even stand you. - Shut up! I'll not let you get away with it. I'll accept the second condition, ..and get my property back!! What a speech! You should have been a leader.. Shut up and think what to do! I have thought about it. It will happen exactly the way you have told her. We'll go to your village and bring in Green Revolution! Wow, what a beauty! Vishal, take a look. Look, do you like her? Babe, come here! She's coming, grab her! What do you want, brat? - What? Don't you have manners? Learn some and teach him too, What do you want? Where's Shyam Nagar? This is Shyam Nagar, who are you? What do you want? Who are they? That's what I'm asking them. Hello. Where's Lala Ganpat Rai's farm? Grandpa's farm? There! Come, drop us there. We have more friends, shall I call everyone? Why not? There is lot of space. Santo, Bantu, Dhanno, moti, Hira!! Place them on your lap now. Pretty clever! Not clever but smart! Why do you want to go to Grandpa's farm? - Shanti! Shanti! How do you know my name? Are you Shanti? - Yes. I'm Vishal, glad to meet you. - What's this? I'm Lala Ganpat Rai's grandson. You! Are you Lala Ganpat Rai's grandson? - Yes. Really?! Sorry I made a mistake. You're respected well here! - Villagers, ..grandpa's grandson is here! Grandpa's grandson is here! Villagers, Grandpa's grandson is here! Grandpa's grandson is here! It's *** hot here. So this is the farmhouse? A hut! Dog. House full! This belongs to a dog! Vishal, was your grandpa living in this stable? No, he lived in the village, He donated that house to village school. Don't worry, we'll make it a paradise. Sir, we are seeing you for the first time. Son, what made you come here after all these years? Well.. - We've helped the city, ..and now thought of doing some good to the village Bringing! - Bringing in Green Revolution here! Is that a well there? Is that a well there? Anyone home? Can I get something? No? Then I'm off! I'll get it there! Don't worry, we'll teach you all the new techniques of farming.. Don't teach them those new techniques, ..that they shouldn't forget their old techniques. Headman, the city has now entered the village! Headman, the city has now entered the village! Who is that beggar? He's a saint, not a beggar. No one argues with him, not even your Grandfather! Alright, but can we get some labors to unload our luggage? Don't worry, We'll help you. Lovely! Very good. What's in these boxes? Nectar, care to taste? Look, the red chili and her friends! Come on in! God! What's this? Sir, we brought you something to eat and drink. Drinking is regular, did you bring us some food as well? Yes! I'll just show to you. - Yes. Bread made of corn flour, garlic paste, mango pickles & onion. Do you call this food? Looks like cattle feed! It seems like it is animal's food. - What? Nothing, what do you have in these pots? - Buttermilk, sir. Hey! What's that? It's called the village beer! Why are you scared? This is our buttermilk, have it. We don't drink all this, try our buttermilk. Let's try. It really cools you down. - Try, try! This is not even toddy! We lead a simple life, no one drinks here. Whoever drinks here gets punished. Captain Batli! You'll get beaten everyday. - I don't mind if she beats me. What's he saying? - Nothing much. He is just showing you his handkerchief. Vishal, let's do one thing. Let's go and see her fields together. As we are new here and we've maintain public relations too. And you know we've to reach the goals. Can you show me your fields? - Why not! Let me wear my pants. - Great. You go ahead. In the meanwhile we'll start to develop the relations here. Look, these are our fields, some have 2 acres, some 4. What are you looking at? - A scene here too? Too bad, don't look there. Any affair between them? - What? Any affair between them? She's newly married, she brought lunch for her husband. How boring! - What? Nothing, let's go. - Come. Come. - Where are you taking me? Here, have some milk. Come here. - Okay. Jump! - How? Hold my hand, extend yours. Why are you pulling me towards you? Jump! I'm covered with mud! Are you tired? Drink the cold water and you'll be fine. How? Yes. Drink it this way. - I have a problem. Where? - What problem? Where? - What problem? Your pants are tight, you should have left them in the city. Bow your head, here. Hey listen! - Yes? Are you having an affair with someone? Why are you laughing? I'll get married the day I fall in love! What? - No affairs! Bhikhu! You can serve strangers, as if I'm worthless! I've asked you not to mess with me! Hey, my love. When did I misbehaved with you? Even I don't want to, but you don't care for me. I would have! Had you been retarded. For you I can be! It’s very nice. Let's go. Get the dresses... Greetings everyone! - Greetings! Come on! - Help! Help! Help! Help! - Come on! Hey stop! - Come here! What are you doing? What are you doing? - This is a village not your city! Only women are allowed in this pond! Oh god please help me - Hey. Lord Rama, Lord Rama Lord Rama, Lord Rama - Leave me. Hey, why are you hitting them? Madam, you go. I am unmarried. We are not allowed to see some women in this condition. Please don’t go. Don’t go. If you leave, he'll smash us. He is a strong man. He can smash you. - Hey, don’t touch me. Not just hands, you just hug him. Hey, You've ruined my religion. Caught you. You are holding my feet. Madam, it's water, I got hold of whatever I can. You dirty insect of village, how can you touch my body? Madam, if you so upset for touching your feet, ..shall I hold your hand. - Shut up, ..bloody idiot, leave me alone. Hey, you are running, my name is Bhiku. I will surely meet you again. Help! Help! Help! Help! Girl, it's a village. Forget about humans, even dogs don’t like nudity over here. One of the female from city , ..was roaming around the village necked. One more thing Mr Chaudhary, Madi told me that two men troubled women in the river. This behavior can affect our families as well. That's true, ..but we have to consider Lala Ganpat Rai's fav ors towards us, ..his grandson brought filthy rats here. We should alert the villagers to stay away from them. So you've managed to woo Shanti right? I can't relax until I do. Wow. - Cheers! Wow. - Chalu! You keep telling me that the tractors are on their way. Where are they? Where are they? Who's going to tell him that we drank away that money? It will come at the right time. When? Farmers have already started sowing seeds in their fields. We'll do that as well, and run the tractor over it later. Lovely! Let's start the process tomorrow, ..forget the tractor, we'll do it with our hands. We'll do it with our hands. - Cheers! Parade halt! Ok boys, get ready to work. What should we do here? The first principle of agriculture is to, ..pull out the weeds from the land. The second principle, clean the field off the stones, ..and sow the seeds. - Oh I see. Start removing the weeds then. Alright! Let's do it. - Okay. 2 inches deep pit here! Buddy, how will the trees grow if we remove the grass? And there would be no rain without the trees, ..and no crop without the rain! And how can we have the Green Revolution without the crops? That's why I think we shouldn't cut the grass. Oh! Correct. Alright, but at least remove the rocks. Hold on! Wait a minute. We need these rocks to mark our names, ..once we've brought in the Green Revolution here. Correct! - So why remove them? Let it be here. - But at least start somewhere. Shall we sow the seeds? - Where is seeds? Go and get the seeds. - Go. Go and get the seeds. - Yes. Go and get the seeds! - Okay. Let me read the chapter on seeds. This field, and the climate Where shall I plant this? - Okay. Look... Keep some water here. Dig a pit 1½ inches deep. Give him another one. - Right. Are you sure that all this is written in the book? - Trust me. Now take that raddish, plant it in the pit with some water. But it's only one raddish. We just need one. In no time there'll be raddishes all around! I hope you aren't fooling me. Why are you laughing at us? - This isn't how one farms! We are not using old techinques. We are using the new techniques. - Go ahead! In the meanwhile I'll learn about the old techniques from Shanti. Shanti, I'll always need your support. Meter Chalu? Yes Darling! - Take this. You're an expert flirt, but hats off to Vishal. Nice! You will support me, right? Hold it, we are sweating. Let the villagers work in the sun, ..we'll work after 4 pm when it's better. Cheers! Oh my lord. Why are you making that noise unnecessarily, ..when the first ray of the sun, ..the temple bells, etc. couldn't wake them up, ..how do you believe to do it? Let's go, they are in deep sleep. Let's go. I'll leave only after the auspicious work. I came for, is done. Wake them up please. They've woken up. Tell them whatever you wanted to. Greetings Sir! What is it this early in the morning? I'm a widow, today is my daughter's betrothal, ..your grandpa used to bless such functions with his presence. Since you're here, ..it'll be nice if you could attend the function and bless her What have I to do with all this? It's all about human relations son. Women and men have many forms; ..one of them is that of a sister and a brother. If you want to recognize this relation, ..consider Bansi as your sister and get her betrothed. Let's go. Now give your brother-in-law the gifts. Here? Congratulation. She's hot! It's your duty to protect the sanctity of this brotherband. Come on, get aside. Let's go, I'm getting bored. Bansi looks hot today. You lost your chance since she"s your sister now. I've a lot of chances here, look there. Wait! - Oh god. Where are you going? Home, where are you going? - I. Yes. - To your house. My house?! Of course! Bansi is lucky to get a secondary school graduate as her partner. Graduate? - Yes. The one who's very knowledgeable. Then he'll keep teaching me forever! - That's right. So what type of a groom do you want? What type of a groom do you want? Whoever my destiny brings to me. - Destiny? Yes. My destiny will bring me a wonderful partner. Then I'm very lucky, the prettiest girl is in my destiny. Who is she? You. Affair? Love isn't for sale here sir! Be sincere or go back to the city. 'Be sincere.' 'Be sincere.' 'Be sincere.' 'Love isn't for sale here sir!' 'Be sincere or go back to the city.' 'Be sincere or go back to the city.' Liquor all the time? A millionaire's son is doomed & none of you are bothered. Where's the tractor you were supposed to bring? Tractor? - Yes, the tractor! What tractor? How else did we buy these cigarettes and liquor? Oh I see, so you all have been ditching me? Did you buy liquor with the tractor money? You scum. Vishal! Stop it. - what are you doing? Go away! - Vishal! All the whiskey… Not just alcohol, you've bought the entire shop you scum. Listen Vishal! Vishal, please don’t throw the whiskey. - Vishal! Please Vishal, stop it. - Vishal! No! No Vishal, No! No! Vishal! Vishal! - No! Darling Vishal?! - Get away! Listen carefully, I want to rejuvenate my ruined destiny. Now I'm determined to cultivate crops here. Stay if you want or leave. He's totally changed! He even raised his hand on her. I'll teach him a lesson. I can use this illiterate villager to teach Vishal a lesson. I'll woo him. Did you just whistle? That's the first time I heard a beauty whistle. What's so special in me? Look into my eyes and you'll realize how beautiful you are! It would be a problem if someone sees us talking here. No one can dare come near me. Oh really. - Yes. Let's go to your house. My house? Lord, my prayers are being answered! But why did you run away from the river the other day? Later that day I realized that, ..you are the real man, rest all are losers. Oh really. So come with me - Your hens. This is not mine. You only for me. Greeting. - Greeting. Do you tie the brotherhood band to bullocks too? Yes. Bullocks protect the farmers. I need a pair of bullocks but no one is selling it to me. Bullocks are any farmer's greatest wealth, ..moreover it's t he season now, ..no farmer is so poor enough to sell his bulls in this seas on. Bye. You need a pair of bullocks, right? Bhiku has it, he neither ploughs nor sows seeds. He may give you the pair for some money. Oh my love. - Bhiku Vishal is here. Bhiku. - You don’t worry. Someone here. - I take this. Here! - Greetings! I need a favor from you. From me? - Yes. What help do you need from me? I need this plough and your pair of bullocks. The bullocks?! It's the season to sow seeds though, But since you've come for the first time, I wouldn't disappoint you. My bulls cost 2000 rupees each. Here's 4000 rupees, bring the bulls to me. Wait, I'll just get them. I feel like singing, I feel like dancing… 1, 2 - Did you sell the bullocks? Yes, that idiot gave 4000 rupees for bullocks worth 2000 only. You'll forever remain an illiterate, Now that he's bought the bullocks, he'll plough the fields. As soon as the crop shoots up, he'll become a millionaire. Idiot, who can become rich by ploughing a small field? Yes, he can become a millionaire and that's why I have come here. I don't want him to farm Bhikhu, I want him to be a beggar, do it by any means possible. Is that so? I'm Bhiku, I can do anything. Brother Vishal! Brother Vishal! Get up, come on. – What? What? - There is a hot girl outside. Girl? - I swear! Brother Vishal! - Careful, careful. Bansi, it's you? Please come inside. Please come. Where is brother Vishal? I came here to tie holy thread to him. Is it? You came here to tie holy thread to your brother? He is taking bath. Maybe he is getting ready for the ritual. Come on, sit inside and wait for him. Come on, please come, come. Please have a seat. Please sit. - Please come. Give me this platter, I'll keep it there. Please… Offer her cold drink. Yes, yes. Please get the cold drink quickly. He is getting cold drink for you. Coco-cola! Just a minute, hurry up. Bring it quickly. He is getting it. Bring it. Take it. - No! Please have it, else Vishal will get upset with us. He'll say that we didn’t welcome his sister properly. Please have it, please… Please have it, please… It's just Coco-cola. Cold drink! Please have it. I'll wait outside. Please let me go, sir. Let me go. Please let me go. Welcome! Bansi is leaving today. - Bansi is leaving. Won't you go and see her off? She was betrothed recently, why is she being married off so soon? This happens when a girl becomes a burden on her poor parents. Let's go. No music on wedding, Kalandar? No music. - It's there but you can't hear it son. Follow me. Look at your sister's face for the last time before she's taken away. Doesn't she look like a beautiful bride! Listen to the dreadful noise! Listen to her screams that can tear your heart into pieces, ..and make the world shiver! Her soul screams out that not her but the humanity died today! I will die along with the humanity, today. Vishal! Hey, Vishal! Which inauspicious moment brought you to this village? She was supposed to get married with her brother's blessing, ..not die because of him! My poor child! Scream as loud as you can, ..so that other mothers can save their daughters, ..from such a devastation. You cannot escape us after all this. Even you should be cremated with Bansi. Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! Bhiku, stop it - Leave me, I won't spare him alive. You're not God Bhikhu! The sinner will be punished for sure, ..but the judge should be pious. But we'll decide his fate! Yes! - No! Get lost forever before we kill you Vishal. Don't you dare come back here. She was your sister. - Beat him and throw him out. You've let down your sister. Kill yourself if you can! You guys can live without liquor, but not me. I've hidden two bottles somewhere here, But can't find them now. Hey! They are my bottles, mine! - Listen! They are my bottles, mine! They are my bottles, mine! How could you do that to my sister She wasn't your real sister. - She was hot. She was my sister. My bottles. Get lost from here, ***! You... - Don't hit me, ..the liquor has already killed me Vishal. Listen, come closer to me, We've always cheated you, for our selfish interest Vishal. I'll tell you the truth in my last hour. Listen, don't leave this farm, ..none of us were your true friends ever, ..we were just longing for your wealth. Don't ever leave this farm. We've done the worst possible, but we named it Aadarsh Farm. Try to... Try turning it into a reality. Here. He'll starve to death now. Shanti, Shanti, please let me have some water, I'm very thirsty. Here, Shanti. - Bansi was no one to you but she was my friend. It's better to spill the water than to quench a sinner's thirst. No, I'm innocent. I was with Bhiku, buying bullocks from him. Believe me, I'm innocent. Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! Rogue, dog, listen carefully, ..the Panchayat decided to slaughter and bury you, ..if you enter these boundaries. Villagers, hear this carefully! If any of you go there, you will face the same. Water. Water. Have some water. I repent that I didnt give you some this afternoon. It's a God's gift, a human has no right to deprive another of water. Drink it. Do you still consider me a human? My father wept to death, ..and my grandpa was insulted by everyone because of me. I destroyed this village as well. I've no right to live, let me starve to death. - No vishal. We'll be cursed if that happens. No, it'll be a blessing. But, where are your friends? They were my enemies, who never let me take the right path. I chased them away and one is lying there, dead. Oh Lord, didn't you do his funeral? I'm a corpse myself. I've sinned Shanti. This is all the result of my sins. I'll be decaying like him tomorrow. Dont say so, it's enough that you're repenting. Come on, have some water. I'll help you to start your new life now. Where are you coming from so late at night? I'm not answerable to you. I protect the village's respect. So what have I done? You went to meet him at this hour, that's what! Bhiku let me go. How can I let you go? Hey, you slapped me. Acting smart, bit me. Where are you going? Uncle! Kallu, is anyone there? Everyone! Come out! - What is it? Leave her! She looks naive but she's a sinner. What? - She went out to meet that man. What? - Yes. Did you go to meet Vishal? No woman of this village has ever stepped out in dark, ..and you secretly go out at night to meet that enemy? What is it? - Uncle... What are you doing here? Ask your daughter how she goes out at the dead of night to meet that guy. Yes. - Is that true? Yes mom, but I didn't do anything wrong. What?! I'll have to teach you a lesson. Come on you... - Aunt, leave her. She has done it by mistake. Vishal! Vishal! I traced out the thief. - Which thief? He's Bhiku, your things and the girl are in his house. Bhiku. Bhiku, open the door and get her out as well. That's Vishal, now what do we do? Don't worry. I'll take you somewhere safe first. I'll handle them. Come with me. Bhiku, you can't escape your fate. Come on, go from the front door. - Bhiku. What did you come here again for? - To confront you! Why are you challenging death? - Death? This is my first step towards life. Then I"ll make it your last! Uncle. - Hey what hapennd? He came to the village again people! - We'll kill him! No, don't raise your hand on Vishal, This entire village will be ruined. Let it be. He's fighting the right battle. Yes, now you'll all know who's good and who's evil. Are you again supporting our foe? Come! I'll show you the reality. Come with me. These are Vishal's things, ..which were stolen by that devil! Look at her, this is what's been happening in this village, Amongst us, the decent families. Come on. Look at her, since when have we turned into Rogues? Initially even I hated and ignored Vishal. And we were forcing him to starve to death outside the village. His is death. We all are burdened by his grandpa's favors. He is starving here, ..and we are living off of his grandfather's debt. I did commit the sin of giving water to a dying man. Kalandar and I are together in this sin. I'm ready for any punishment but at least give justice to Vishal. Forgive us, we misunderstood you. But why did you bring such filthy people with you? He's repented for that sin, but who'll clean this dirt? Us! Yes! Us! - No! Bhiku, wipe off your sweat. Bhikhu, This land will turn barren, if even one drop of your sweat falls on it. Let's lock them in the house and burn it down. No, the sinner will burn in the sin's fire! Bhiku, leave this village. Now! Let him go. Vishal will have to face the consequences for challenging me. Shanti. - Mother! What are you staring at now? He'll be a millionaire and you'll remain useless. You are a useless creature. Where are you going? You'll have to live and die here with me. Get out. Shalini's photo, with you? How do you know her? What's your relation with her? She is my sister. Your real sister? - Of corce! We were very young when our parents died. She's been living in the city since. But why are you asking me this? Vishal's father wanted him to marry her, ..and even the will is made in her favour. This is how tables turn! If the will favor's my sister, I'll get all the property. My name is Bhiku. Until I'm alive, nobody can prove that Come on. No! Set fire to the crops! Stop it! No! Get out! Get out! Get out! Hit him. Crush him. - Stop it! Shalini, get aside! Did you call me here to see this bloodshed? No, to assure you that he too is finished along with the crops. You'll inherit the property now, which you will transfer to me! No! His grandfather raised us up, ..got me educated and gave us a new life, brother. Shut up. How can you do this to him? Lock her up until she agrees to transfer the property to me. No. please... Save me Vishal! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Leave her! You're not strong enough to hold these horses Kalandar. God's devotees have a strong will. Run away! Go. Crush that lame man too! Take it, godman. Call your god! Vishal! Vishal. Oh god. Don't hit me! - Why? Bhiku! Lord Krishna wouldn't have incarnated if Kans didn't exist. Lord Rama wouldn't have incarnated had Ravenna not existed. Had there been no massacre or bloodshed, Buddha and Jesus wouldn't have spread their message. Why would God sent Rasool, had humans had the sense of equality? Tell me why? Speak up! Speak up! Run as much as you can. We won't leave him today. No! Please Don’t hit me!. What's going on? Grandpa! Help grandpa, they'll kill me. The sinner will get the punishment and not the innocent. Leave him. - Grandpa, he has committed grave sin. He has burnt the crop. I know everything, but not you, law will punish him. By burning crops, he has not only betrayed the village but entire nation. Hand him over to the police. No. I'll do whatever you want me to. Spare me. Hello. - God bless you. Grandpa, vishal is a changed man now. Really. - There he is. Vishal! Vishal, get up! No, don't let me get up. I can't feel happier or complete anywhere else. You're right son, get up. My, Vishal. Do you know it's your birthday today? Where's my gift then? This year you do deserve a gift! Grandpa! You'll now manage your dad's business. I won't go anywhere grandpa. This is where my father started the business, I'll live here! I want the same for you son! Come with me. Seek Kalandar's blessings. - No. You don't need blessings anymore son! May peace be with you. - Which Shanti? "The soil of this earth is like Sandal," "we'll put a vermilion on our forehead and sing." "Flowers bloom in every garden!" "Flowers bloom in every garden!" "Flowers bloom in every garden!"
