[waves crashing] JONAH AND THE PINK WHALE [water dripping] [intriguing music] [hissing] Jonah? Jonah. Jonah. Wake up. Are you going to be late again? [sighs] Where did that stupid Emilia leave me my pills? I can never find anything. All this mess... As hot as it is... [sighs] What a pity that wigs are going out of fashion. I'd like to buy 10, 20, 30 wigs. One blonde, another one... Get dressed, will you? And stop poking around in there. [bright music] [door closes] The gentleman wants to see you right away. Tell my father-in-law to pick me up after work. [yelling] There was no people that surpassed the Egyptians in their faith. This one is yours. They believed that the soul rested in the body like a... Like a little airplane. [laughing] They were obsessed with death. Pass it on. Since they could not take possession of the body, it was necessary to avoid that putrefaction of the corpse, because only in this way could they understand life. The pharaohs were embalmed, impressive eternal mummies, stiff, and they took to the tomb all their riches. [laughing] Who threw the little plane? [laughing] Do you know what the most chic gift was? Think. A death mask. Women prostituted themselves in order to get a fashionable sarcophagus. Thank God, that fashion has changed, Mr. Larriva. Come with me. Your father-in-law's driver is waiting for you, he says it's urgent. [chuckles] Don't come in, my dad is getting more than ever. Your father was born a wimp. What did he do now? [chuckles] You're looking good. I bet you just went bankrupt. Oh, no! It's better than that. Now we're really going to drown in a sea of money. Sit down. - Bring a whiskey for the gentlemen. - Scotch? The master strictly forbade me to serve it in the morning. The prohibition is revoked. Sir, you ordered me to be deaf to your prohibitions. Are you deaf? I told you I want whiskey. For me without ice. It's hard to get along with these people, for fuck's sake. [lighter clicks] I have a business for you... I hope you will reflect and seek the best for my daughter. - I'm not interested. - You will be interested. I propose to build a structure... A unique structure of its kind. For fuck sakes. I thought you were Catholic. Get the fuck out of the way! Follow me. Who is my worst enemy? Your poor relatives in the province, who take a lot of money from you... Your children, the income tax... Yourself, your wife... Ira is a saint and don't make jokes. My archenemies are the narcos. [laughing] What have they done to you now? Why do you think I let my daughter my daughter get married to a bum like you? Because at least with at least with you no scoundrel is going to bother her. The one that worries me is Julia. - Julia. - Julia. I'm going to show those fucking narcos how decent people die, because in life, any pig has an orgasm. Look at the evil they do. Continue. Continue. Continue. With me they will understand those wretched people what spiritual aristocracy is. Do you want to get fat on money? Daddy's going to build a cemetery on the sand hill. What do you know about my business? [mysterious music] I'm going to build a mausoleum for you. [fire crackling] Are you already thinking of leaving? I'm going to bury them all. [intriguing music] [Egyptian music] [gasps] This is so crazy. Manage the construction of my mausoleum and I'll give you everything you want. Sir, I brought you your jelly. [Egyptian music continues] [laughing] [gasps] I don't want to go to the afterlife without my friend Pablo. He is just Delpaso, not Delpaso and Troncoso. I don't want to, with this life is enough for me. Don't crawl, lizard. How much do you want? Pablo! Pablo! Come. Come, Jonah. Dr. Drought, an eminence in the art of mummification. He comes from Canada. My son-in-law, the one I told you about, Jonah Larriva. Say hello, Drought. The Egyptians used to take their brains out out through the nose. Dr. Drought uses a preservative chemical that is injected into the cranial cavity and converts the encephalic mass into a plastic ball. I know you have a weakness for Egyptian things. What do you decide? [wind blowing] I'm waiting for your answer. I'm going to build the most beautiful most beautiful mausoleum in America. - The first pyramid of Christendom. - Not interested. I knew it. I just wanted to confirm your stubbornness to remain mediocre. Let's see if you get $15 on the street for your teacher's salary! [car revving] The people united will never be defeated! 19, 20, 21, 24... Very good. Is that your salary? Yes. You have 16.470.000 and the change is... I just looked it up. 1.109.000 So, you have... What a fortune. $14.85. Since I don't need to take from there because it's so little, I give you 15 and since the government does not give him give you 15 cents, teacher. That's it. Thanks, see you later. The people united will never be defeated! [camera shutters] The people united will never be defeated! Long live the Central Obrera Departamental! Long live! What do we want? Minimum wave! What do we want? Minimum wave! Long live the Central Obrera Departamental! Long live! The people united will never be defeated! [camera shutters] [camera shutters] Get off. You're messing up my hair. No, cystitis. - I'm still not well with cystitis. - Don't be a liar, I saw the tests. There's nothing wrong with you. Well, I have an unbearable itching. Yesterday I peed real blood, reddish. [chuckling] That's all you think about. I told you we're going to do it Saturday, tomorrow. I'm going to put up with cystitis just because it's your birthday. Congratulations! [upbeat music] [band playing] [explosions] JONAH [people cheering, applauding] Congratulations, Jonah. Where are my friends? Be a good boy. You're late. We've been waiting for you for hours. I didn't know you were waiting for me. Don't play dumb, you knew perfectly well that we had a surprise for you. How was I supposed to know if it was a surprise? What a breath you have. You went out drinking with the intention of annoying us. We are starving because of you. It's your son's fault, he can never be trusted with anything. If it was your idea. Another, another, another. [laughing] There, there. [chuckling] Surprise. Thank you. Why don't you take a picture for us? Congratulations, brother-in-law. [camera shutters] What a divinity of women. [whimsical music] [indistinct chattering] [coughing] [whimsical music] This country is going down the drain because of the fucking inflation. Imagine, the seventh worst inflation in all of human history. We almost reached 15,000%. However, there are scoundrels who squander fortunes. As if it were nothing. Your arrangements are beautiful and the meat is exquisite. Your party looked beautiful, mom. I see all your friends are here. Have you been drinking, Julita? Is that why I see them young? Long live youth, gentlemen! [coughing] Stop it, Julia. Don't be unfriendly. [snorts] I've seen your presents. Shall I serve you wing or leg? Who are you dating, daughter? With many, and I don't plan to marry until I'm old. Why do you always talk with your mouth full? Marriage is a disadvantage for women. What do you know? You're all right to talk. You told me yourself, mom. - We're not finished, Julita. - She told me herself. "Don't marry a virgin, daughter. One ends up regretting it. They force her to eat chicken soup without having tasted another dish before... [chuckles] Enjoy your meal. [thunder rumbling] [groaning] [groaning] Enough. - [knocking on door] - [gasps] [knocking continues] I've been raped. Alex Tambas? - The bald guy? - Yes, your friend. Last night I came home alone at 3 AM. Alone at 3 AM? Yes, alone. Are you going to let me tell you what happened? I came alone to the club. I get in and see a shadow from the gallery. That shadow is Alex. Come here, I want to show you something. He grabs me by my arm and takes me to the funeral parlor. Then he says to me: "I need to borrow your phone." When I ask him what for, - he answered... - To call my mom. Alex took my clothes off. [disconnect tone] He was like crazy, I'd never seen him like that before. Pull down your pants. "Pull down your panties." the bastard said to me. Shame on him. As dirty as they were... Then he gave me the full service. Look, Julia, it seems to me that you actually made his job easier. - Don't smoke so early. - I'll call the doctor. - If you haven't been stabbed. - That's what you'd like. - Stupid. - Natalia. Why does she have to be out on the street at that hour? I feel like telling my parents to tell my parents about it. It's their fault for spoiling her so much. [sighs] Cocky girl. Did he hit you? Did he hurt you? No. He was just saying "I love you". I love you. So many times that it stunned me. It has to be reported. If the damn rapists always get away with it, because the poor little victims have such a hard time explaining what happened? This is annoying, Julia. Shut up, Natalia. [sighs] The important thing is that you're fine. Thank you. What did you do last night, motherfucker? Last night... Don't you remember? [humming] Do you have a cigarette? What happened with Julia? What happened with Julia last night? [soft music playing] Nothing. Jonah, I don't work with women. So nothing happened? You've never had that happen to you? [intriguing music] Where is Jonah? I sent Pablo to bring him. Let's see if that useless son of yours does something right. My dears... Why did you have to spend so much money on the party? Don't exaggerate. Jonah must be treated well. He's a wild card. What matters is that they have a child. One more mouth? Are you crazy? I work like a nigger and you spend and spend. [parrot yelling] I've had enough of you. What aberration am I being accused of? Nothing, son. In the ministry they have too much work to take care of a teacher of fifth category. You are fired. Are you sure? What did I do wrong? Who complained? I have never been absent, I've always done my job. When have you ever seen anyone in the government fired for non-compliance? Surely it is a question of political reasons. Talk to them, maybe they'll take your job, but not your salary. You know how things work in this country. Your family conspired to get me kicked out of my job. They used their influence in La Paz. My family wouldn't do that. Your family makes me sick to my stomach. There is no evil that does not bring good tied to the tail. - Did you copy your mother's saying? - How unfair you are. Hey... - The doctor says I have trichomonas. - Oh, please... Oh, what a beautiful bed. Tomorrow I'm going to look for the carpenter to make me one just like it. [whimsical music] [water running] [soft music] [light clicks] So this is what you're hiding. What do you want? I need to talk to you. May I come in? Come in. [soft music continues] I just found out that on Monday you were fired from your job. I already have a job. - Photographer? - Uh-huh. What do you got? Ever since Alex raped me, I haven't been able to kiss anyone on the mouth. Don't be a wise guy. Stop or I'll tell my sister that you're hitting on me. Hit on you? [scoffs] Look, stop chewing your gum and we'll talk. What are you here for? Hey, how about you teach me photography? I need a hobby too. What do you plan to photograph? Nudes. I knew it, you depraved man. I'm warning you, I'm not going to pose naked. What? Well... Maybe so. [chuckles] No, I'm not going to pose naked. Don't worry about it, you weren't in my plans. Well. If you ever think of it, you know my answer. - I'm not going to ask you. - Why not? Am I not pretty? - You're no good to me. - Oh, don't you? And how do you want them? Sick, you know, dramatic. Uh... Gold diggers. Well, I've lived too. Sick women. - Dramatic women. - Hey. Look, even if I get chronic diarrhea and get skinnier than a tubercle worm, remember this, tick brain. Julia doesn't pose naked. You're playing with very serious business, dad. I've already told you that no one enters in my pyramid in a common casket. I want it to be just like this. Did you hear me? Yes, Mr. Patroclo. For the record, I only let you take the mold because you are going to give me another bedroom set. Let's see if this way you get pregnant with your daddy and a male, daughter. Dolores. [chuckles] Dolores! Yes, sir? Go find my son-in-law. Right away. Easy, baby. I've already told you, I've got it all figured out. Nobody recognizes the importance of my work, for fuck's sake. [Egyptian music] I have to travel. - I need your help. - You got the Canadian. - American. - Canadian, Patroclo. American, I don't want any Canadian in my company. From today he is American, like James Bond. James Bond is English. But he works in the United States. That's a great country. It's only ten days. I already have a job. Oh, yeah? You don't say? Leave Jonah out of your debauchery. I'm getting into photography. Yes, daddy. The daughter of Marta Solis is competing for Miss Bolivia, they need a photographer. I'm not going to discuss that now. I'm going to Miami with Drought. We will only use American marbles. I hope that upon my return you have come to your senses. [chuckles] I leave you a souvenir. Put it under your bed and wait. He fills the money boxes with money and to the impotent he hoists the flag. And he makes your wife pregnant with twins. Tomorrow I'll expect you at eight o'clock. Don't forget it. [whimsical music] I got you an interview at the law firm. You're not going to deny me this pleasure. What did you study law for? To waste your time as a social photographer? No, to work four hours a day. Everyone works at least eight. The happiest work twelve. Victor Canes, my dear. Mr. Canes went to the President's birthday in La Paz. Ira Delpaso and Troncoso, don't come to me with stories. Excuse me, ma'am, then the gentleman must be the new lawyer. Exactly, my son-in-law. Mr. Larriva, I'll show you to your office right away. Put up the new blinds. Victor. Good to see you, Ira. Welcome, Jonah. Come in, please. No apology? Where were you? I'm waiting for your excuses. Stop it, will you? I forgot you were expecting me. You forgot. I'm not leaving the firm to come and watch you throw away 20 packs of Polaroid film. Not if they're not wasted, you can still stick them up your ass. Wow. What's wrong with my Polaroid, little thing for you? Great photographer. Are you staying or leaving? I'm leaving. Bye. [scoffs] If you need anything, Mr. Larriva, press the tiny button. Jonah. Arminda. Press the tiny button, Mr. Larriva. Press the tiny button. [beep] Arminda. Yes, Mr. Larriva? Tell me. Do you know who this belongs to? It must be Mr. Gumucio's. What happened to your ex-boss? He works selling counterfeit dollars on the street, he's doing very well. Tell me, Mr. Gumucio, was he a drag queen? [chuckles] Then the envelope must be mine. When Mr. Gumucio was there, there was so much work that I had to change right here, no offense. Stop. How swell. Such serenity. Hey, what do you do to make your models pose so relaxed? [chuckles] It's an assignment, Julia. Not bad. I know you're dying to invite me to pose. You think I'm inexperienced? Strutting around in a bikini at the pool at the Country Club? [chuckles] No. It's not the same as taking your clothes off in front of the camera. [chuckles] What are your requirements? To have danced naked in a cabaret? That you be consistent with your experience, you know-it-all brat. You think you know life because you've read Françoise Sagan. Look. If I'm a brat, you're a hypocrite. [chuckles] Cheer up, man. Cheer up. Aren't you going to ask me to pose naked? Ask me. Please. [scoffs] Take your clothes off. Pig, I knew you'd end up entangling me in your pornographies. Well, then, don't get undressed. Oh, you don't? Then I'll undress. No, no, no. Please. Don't play, Julia. [gasping] Ready? [sighs] Ready? What? Aren't you going to bring the camera? Just one picture, nothing else. And you're not going to show it to anyone. I can't. I knew it. You're a good-for-nothing, as my father says. I can see why you haven't given a son to my sister, faggot. [camera shutters] [intriguing music] [camera shutters] Another one. [camera shutters] Other. [camera shutters] Other. [camera shutters] Let's not do it. Let go of me, please. I'm a virgin. Just a quick one. [heavy breathing] What is it? [moaning] [soft music] Julia, Julia! Julia. Julia. Julia! [whimsical music] We're going to be late and look how you're coming. - What? - Move it, Natalia. - Sit in the back. - I sit in front, you move. Oh, Julia, for God's sake. Move or I'll take you out. What a tomboy you are. Come on, daughter, sit down in the back. Bitches! [door slams] [moaning] Oh! - [chair hits the floor] - [laughing] [wind blows] My period's been late for two weeks. My payment's been late for three weeks. I don't know which one is worse. [laughs] [sarcastically] How funny. We'll have to be more careful, right? My period's late! Don't you get it? Shut up! They're going to hear us. So what? I'll let everyone know you're a degenerate! Maybe you'll have your period again in nine months. What would you do in that case, asshole? - Julia, I thought we said-- - I won't take the pill. - What? - From now on, you'll wear a condom! [rain pattering] Arminda, why are these people here? - They're looking for you, Mr. Larriva. - Jonah! Don't you recognize your friends anymore? - How are you doing, Antonio? - I'm glad to see you! The last time we saw each other was during our vacation at the ranch. - Do you remember that? - Of course. It's a shame you lost that ranch, it was beautiful. Do you remember when we healed that horse's leg? - Chico Lindo! How are you? - Jonah. Sorry. I didn't recognize you. Did you think I was going to stay on as a farmhand? Sit down, please. Thank you. Arminda, I'm not taking any calls. Oh, how I loved your father! I think he could have been president of the republic. I'm very sorry. It's a shame. You've been doing well, huh? What do you do? He's my son. He's studying at the best university in the US. Say hello, Grigotá. He's shy, but he's won at many dog shows. He's tamed every bitch in town. [laughing] Mr. Larriva, you have a call. It's urgent. Excuse me, please. - Hello? - Jonah, I've got my period. - Come here now. - I'll be there soon. So, what can I do for you? [laughing] INCREDIBLE WEDDING FOR A LOVELY COUPLE: JONAH AND JULIA Julia. Julia. [melancholic music] What's that? I used to collect butterflies as a child. Now it's you that I collect. [chuckles] What do we have here? Let's see. What's this? [laughs] They look so small. They're empty. Wanna fill another one up? You're getting a hard-on, aren't you? Mm-hm. [chuckles] This turns you on. June 12th. This isn't mine. I was in La Paz that day. It gave me pleasure, too. I was thinking of you when I used it. You don't really care, do you? You don't care that I slept with someone else. [rain pattering] [car door closes] Take me to the Country Club. - Where were you last night? - I dozed off. That's not the key. You car wasn't at home. Pablo borrowed it, he had to go to the hospital. Pablo? Don't let Pablo borrow your car. Look, Mom, he's my brother even if he's not your son. [car trying to start] [sighs] This car is trash. We'll get you a new one tomorrow and don't let anyone borrow it, okay? [car trying to start] I'll take a cab. This is yours. - Won't you take off your clothes? - No. Why? I don't know. I feel ashamed. Don't be ashamed of your belly button, I love it! Well. Fishy, fishy. Jonah, I'm not a whore. I don't feel like it. What's the matter, Julia? [Julia sobs] What happened to us, Jonah? I thought of Alex while we made love yesterday. [Jonah] I better leave. Do you remember the day you went to La Paz? [dreamy notes playing] Girl with pretty eyes, swaying between silences. You inebriate the angels. You're a sorceress and you don't even know it. How many times has the sun set just to touch the sea of your sleeping belly with its quivering lips? [Julia crying] Why do you men never know how you make us feel? Jonah... do you love me? [bright music] Get in the water. - Come, Jonah. - I don't like cold water. It's warm. I didn't bring my swimwear. You have underwear, right? Get in your underwear. Jonah doesn't like getting in the water. Don't insist. Jonah doesn't know how to swim. - I bet you'd sink like lead. - Shut up! [water splashing] You do know how to swim, don't you, Alex? [water splashing] I hope she finally settles down, even if it's with that bald guy. I'll go for a walk. [laughing] I'm going to look for wild berries, Jonah. Jonah! I heard you, and I don't want to go. I got something. You are more absentminded than usual. What's the matter? This feels nice. I'm in love, for real this time. But... I don't have the courage to tell her. Kill it. Kill it! [eerie music] We are patriots, Mr. Larriva. Have you put yourself in people's shoes? What would you do if you found out that your country was bankrupt? Apparently, you don't understand anything. What should I understand? What would happen to this country if the police put all drug traffickers in jail? We would lose the only US dollars that keeps us afloat. Mr. Larriva, your father-in-law has gone bankrupt. [scoffs] Do you want proof? You are fired. Mr. Larriva, I hope you get to be a great lawyer. Why Miami? That's what I don't understand. Julia hates Americans! It will do her good to learn English and refine her tastes. - In Miami? - In Miami. Where's Julia? You don't know? Miss Julia moved to Miami. - Do you want a coffee? - No. - Okay. - Julia. Jonah? Jonah. It's Wednesday, but it doesn't matter. [rattling] No, no, no, no! Be very careful with it. This way! [melancholic music] PRESIDENT SILES SUAZO STARTS A HUNGER STRIKE [dreamy notes playing] Julia had to leave the country. Before she left, she asked me to give this to you. You'll start working with Patroclo tomorrow. Why the fuck didn't you tell me that I had to replace oxygen with argon? Hey, Jonah, do you know where to find argon to keep the mummy from decomposing? This gringo is crazy! Take a look at this. "In this time of economic disaster, there are people who are engaged in immoral business, such as death." MAYOR'S OFFICE INVESTIGATES CONSTRUCTION OF CLANDESTINE CEMETERY [chuckles] Look at this. [Jonah] Won't you say anything? Let them be, they are jealous. Bunch of lousy journalists. Everyone knows that I'm building a mausoleum for my family. - She's pretty, isn't she? - Yes. Ah, Miss Bolivia. Do you know who her father is? The most important drug trafficker in the country. It's unbelievable! These criminals control everything. One of these days, they'll marry their daughters with the archbishop in the cathedral. Why doesn't the press focus on them? Patroclo, people say you are bankrupt, is it true? That's a lie. [intriguing Egyptian music] I had no idea this kind of amusements existed in our country. [Patroclo] Death is no amusement. The mayor's office should not allow... Jonah, letter from Julia. I prefer to make love with living women. Can you imagine a brothel for dead people? What's this world coming to? What are you talking about? Are you calling me a pervert? Jonah, do something! This guy is insulting me. [shutter clicks] [Julia] I hate gringos. I have no intention of learning English, fuck them. However, I feel very good being away from you all. Julia. [Jonah] Julia, my love. Come back soon. I'm sorry I never had the courage to tell you. Never. I love you. [sad piano music] [Julia] I came looking for you. Too bad you weren't here. I put this sheet between my legs. Don't you want to kiss it? Jonah. Jonah? Jonah, sweetie. My head hurts. Don't you think it's time to ask the stork for a baby? My cucuruchis. Our house is going to be auctioned off. Don't worry, you're the best at coming up with sources of income. And you guys are the best at coming up with ways to spend it! Goddammit! [cutlery clinking] What's the matter, Dad? [sighs] So nothing's wrong? You never drink, Dad. Having troubles with the pyramid? No, there's something wrong with Julia. What is it, Mom? She's damaging my reputation. Why? I send her to the States and that ungrateful brat behaves like a-- Patroclo, please. What did Julia do now? - She is dating a guy named Grigotá. - She's dating Grigotá? Who is Grigotá? What an ugly name. He's the son of a drug trafficker. [plane whirring] - Are we going to the hospital? - Hurry up, we're going in my car. [melancholic music] Hi. I need to change my clothes. Get out of my room, Dad. I need to change my clothes. Look, Julia, I want to make something very clear. And it's not up for discussion. I forbid you to see that guy again. What guy? The one from Miami. Get out of my room, Dad. We need to go to the hospital. Where's my fish? Your mother isn't sick. Hello, my child. I hate you! [suspenseful music] What are you doing in my office? You're staining the carpet with your cigarette. - Do you want a drink? - Get your hands off my whiskey! He came to see me, Dad. [Patroclo] Go to your room, Julia. My room? I no longer have a room in this house. [Patroclo] I said, go to your room! Go to your room, Julia. Grigotá Rodríguez, Mr. Delpaso Troncoso. Delpaso and Troncoso, Mr. "Grigota." - Grigotá. - Grigotá. That's the name of a cannibal. Tell that to my father. Chico Lindo, another cannibal! You must be very proud of the family business. Cocaine, a very booming sector. You should be ashamed. Don't blame the children for the mistakes of their parents, Mr. Dompaso. Delpaso! I don't want you to see my daughter again. - I think you still don't understand. - No, I don't. I'm a narrow-minded, fascist, racist man. And I'm full of prejudices. So I won't tolerate an Indian in my family. Julia and I love each other. Love doesn't exist. What do you mean "Love doesn't exist?" Tell your father the truth, sweetheart. Grigotá and I are married, Dad. Get out of my house. This is no longer your house, Julia. I said get out! [suspenseful music] Hi, beautiful. Your brother Pablo called, he said it's urgent. He'll meet you at the Café de la Plaza. - Thank you. - Go with her. [car engine starts] Julia. It was me who called, not Pablo. Don't-- don't worry. I just wanted to give you this. I never had the courage to send them. I don't know why, but... [ominous music] You're a crook. How could you do this? It's my duty as a citizen. Fostering development and making sure their US dollars are put to good use. [intriguing Egyptian music] [laughing] Have you ever thought about where Patroclo got the money to build his pyramid? Knowing you, you must have already made up that Patroclo associated with the mafia. Stop making up stories and go help him. When you do business with narcos, it's for life. - Your father sold Julia to the narcos. - Liar. Julia loves Grigotá. The poor guy is not to blame for being the son of a narco. My dad had to accept him. Right, Mom? [groans] [screams] Get out. Your father sold Julia to the narcos. She didn't sell her, they got her for free. [sad piano music] So this is where you hide. Can I come in? I have something for you, too. Here. Open it. My letters? No. My letters. [chuckles] "I can't forget about you." "My playlist has only one song now: Jonah." Jonah. Jonah, Jonah. And it's your fault. I'm sorry. Keep reading. "You made my body addicted to love." "What a torture." You are no longer Jonah, just a measuring stick for others. What about Grigotá? What about him? Why did you marry him? He doesn't touch me. Well, only on Saturdays. [laughing] I'm sorry, Julia. I'm sorry. Let's get out of here. Let's go to Santa Cruz, Julia. They won't let us. I'm not allowed to go anywhere. And we'd need money. Give me a week. Do you mean it? I love you. I love you. I love you. [sad piano music] [mariachi music playing] [distant chatter] Get off me! Now that you're with that rich girl you don't care about me. Listen, Jonah, I have a clinical eye for hiring people and you are not fit for this business. Of course I am. My boys are in the best prisons in the world and when they get out, they come back begging me for more work. Do you know why? No, I don't. Why? Because they'd sell their mothers just to get a Maserati. And you, Jonah, what do you want? This is my house too. I'm going to kick those whores out of here. - Where were you last night? - You're a macho man now? Son of a bitch! [door slams] Don't touch it. I do not recommend it. It has a secret compartment. [sniffs] I'll give you your 20,000 when you get back. [pensive music] Dollars, pesos! Dollars, dollars! We exchange dollars. Argentinian fag. You fucking Argentinian. Where did you put the drugs? - I'm not Argentinian. - Shut up! I'm Bolivian. You are under arrest for fake documents and drug trafficking. Don't be ridiculous, please. It is you who are ridiculous. How about that? An Argentinian posing as a Bolivian. You are in a lot of trouble, Diego. We're going to torture the shit out of you. If you give me 20,000, I'll let you escape. 20,000 cruzeiros? I don't think you mean pesos. 20,000 dollars, asshole! Don't you prefer Swiss francs? - Are you going to talk? - Stop! Don't hit me! I am a drug dealer, the drugs are in the suitcase, in a secret compartment. Fucking narcos. Felipe, where do you think this fucking Argentinian hid the drugs? I think he swallowed them. Smugglers are now swallowing bags full of cocaine. Are you going to talk? [screams, gasps] The light bulb burned out! You see, Felipe? These pigs need to be taught to cherish life so that they act appropriately. We are underpaid and on top of that we have to interrogate clowns. Asshole. Why didn't you tell us from the beginning that you are Bolivian? You pretended to be Argentinean. You are free to go, the report was a joke. [train whistling] [rain pattering] Antonio, what did I do wrong? The suitcase was empty. We smuggled the drugs successfully. We used you as bait. Now get out, I don't want to see you ever again. My brother is dead. Grigotá? What about Julia? [dramatic music] Leave her, there is nothing to be done. Why didn't they leave the weapons locked up? [tragic music] [woman] And on top of that, she was pregnant! I heard they killed themselves. - Because of her husband? - Because of the narcos. They say her father made her get married. But it was the mother's idea. How about that for a coffin? It's a sarcophagus. [giggles] What a shame. She was so pretty. It was an overdose. - No wonder! - The flood was a punishment from God. And Julia's death? - Virgin Mary's revenge. - For being a whore. - Her sister, on the other hand... - She's a goody-goody. [solemn music] [whispering voices] [intriguing Egyptian music] [hopeful music]
