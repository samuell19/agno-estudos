[whimsical music] - [Narrator] Many million moons ago, the spirit of Colabra came down from the mountain, one of peace and wonder. A benevolent, ancient entity, it presented the world with a miracle. They were small, precious eggs, which brought forth five prehistoric baby dinosaurs. Creatures of fun and innocence. Sacred and untouched, bringing joy and happiness to the world which discovered them.

[dinosaur squealing] [adventurous music] - Tina, I'll meet you at the car. - [Tina] Okay, I'm just playing 9. Harry? - [Harry] I'm there, I'll be with you. - Action! - When I was on tour, from Pebble Beach to Augusta, I was never without my personalized golf ball monogrammer. As you know, being able to tell the difference between your ball and others can make the difference between winning and losing a tournament. Now, this remarkable device can be yours for the amazing low price of 89.99. And if you order now, I'm gonna throw in an official Hal MacGregor Golf Pro Divot Duster at no extra charge. - Well, it's a booming good game she's had today. Five birdies and two eagles. She's three strokes away from being the first lassie to win the British Open. And oh, what a bonny shot! She knocked the dimples off that one. But blast, the wind is carrying it a wee bit. Oh... [glass breaks] - And take a tip from a pro. Poise under pressure. That's the mark of a champion. - [Director] Cut! And print. That was perfect, Hal. - Of course it was. Don't forget our bet. - Darn. Can't believe you did it in one take. - What's life without a few gambles? [chuckling] - Okay, let's move on. - A purple Titleist. This ball can only belong to my niece. [dramatic music] [lighthearted music] [car honking] [dinosaurs screeching] [car honking] [lighthearted music] [car honking] - Come on, baby. - [Man] What's the hold up? - Come on, start. - [Man] Come on, let's go! [car honking] - Get a move on, grandpa, would you! I have an 8 o'clock tee off! - [Man] Get out of the way! [car honking] - Are you deaf, old man? I said move this jalopy! - Pardon me. Do you have any Grey Poupon? - I said move this vehicle, sir. - Oh, you better get back your sense of humor there, buddy. [chuckling] - [Man] Come on, buddy. Oh, come on! I can't be here all day. Go around him! [lighthearted music] - Hm. Nothing wrong underneath here. [lighthearted music] - [Man] What's going on up there? [dinosaurs screeching] - Ella's going to need a dandy shot here, or she'll be feeling mighty dour tonight. - Gee, can I have that one for a welcome mat? [laughing] - Oh. Top of the morning to you. - Let's face it, MacGregor. You'll never be a golfer. You stink. Your whole family stinks. In fact, they shouldn't call it MacGregor's Putt Putt. Instead, they should call it MacGregor's... [man raspberries] [laughing] - I'll be playing the great course at St. Andrews one day. All's I need is some practice. - This is a member's only club, and I get teed off at duffers like you who sneak onto our course. [laughing] - This is me uncle's golf course. Go ask Hal. I'm a MacGregor just like him. - He told me to get rid of the riff raff, and that means you. - I better be off. I got some fish and chips waiting for me. - Not until you pay the fine! [lighthearted music] - I can't go any faster, Captain. I'm giving it all she's got. My delithium crystals are all used up. [lighthearted music] Heath, he's about to have me all mincemeat. That Needlemeyer bloke is after me. - Take a chill pill, Bee Girl. Mellow up and talk normally, you sound like a tard. - You should talk! You should be proud of your kin. MacGregors are the noblest clan in Scotland. [carts honking] - What are you doing? [carts honking] - What is going on? - How rude! - So, are you hide me, lad? Before I get me noggin' whacked? - Are you baked? I'm not tangling with those biff-tads, I'll lose my caddying job. [chuckling] - Come on! - All right, I'll go first. - Time to get rough in the rough. [grunting] - Leave me alone! - You bloody hate golf! - It may be the Lawrence Welk of sports, but it's the only gig in this town that's gonna help me get the yen to buy the most righteous guitar and amps. Sorry, no go, compadre. Fight those Izods on your own. - Oh, blast! - Hey! Slacker! Aren't you supposed to caddy for the Wellingtons? - Yeah, 3 o'clock, I was just killing time. I thought I'd catch some rays too. - Who told you you could think, loser? You are a disgrace to this establishment and this uniform. Button your shirt, freakazoid! And cut your hair, boy. - Anything but that, please. I'll even narc on my sister. - I'll take it under consideration. Come on, boys. Time to play some hopscotch. - Yeah! - I hate those guys. [men chattering] [lighthearted music] [pipe bubbling] - I'll bet three hearts. - I am so bored! Every weekend it's the same routine. We play Marco Polo in the pool all morning, get thrown out for taking a leak in the waiting area, and then we play bridge until our stupid parents finish playing their 18 holes. Oh, the humanity! - I'll show 'em. I'll put sunblock on their battery cables. - You're right, Reginald. Nothing exciting ever happens around here. - Here we go! [chuckling] - There you are, Ella. I'm going to change your handicap. [laughing] [groaning] - Wow! Neato! - Cool! [lighthearted music] - Trespassing again, Ella? - Uncle Hal. - I believe you need to be taught a lesson. - But Uncle, we're flesh and blood. [chuckling] - Bad blood. Your family's a disgrace to the MacGregors, your father's a loser, and that broken window at the clubhouse tells me you're just like him. - Stop your bickering, brat. Me dad's a fine man. - You're a little green, young one. [creaking] What's the matter with this thing? [dinosaur screeching] [groaning] - I must bustle! Cheerio, old pal! - Get back here! [groaning] [yelling] [lighthearted music] ♪ You take the low road ♪ And I'll take the high road ♪ And I'll be in Scotland before ye ♪ [torch blowing] [lighthearted music] [groaning] [door creaks] - Blasted door! And Ella, I thought I told you I didn't want you golfing. - Don't hassle her, Thomas. - I wasn't golfing. See, I don't have me clubs. - Then what are you doing with your knickerbockers on, young lady? - All me other duties were in the wash. - Well, it's a good thing, it's a silly game. What's so great about knowing how to get some stupid ball into a silly hole? - Looks to me like Ella has discovered zen in the art of golfing. - I couldn't of said it better meself, Mom. Did you know the king of Scotland once had to ban golf? - [Thomas] A wise man. - So many people were playing it that nobody was practicing their archery. The king was afraid that the Scottish homeland couldn't be defended. - He was probably afraid nobody was doing their chores too. - Want some haggis? - Oh, who barfed? - It's a bonny good Scottish meal. Made of vegetables, beef, and onions. It's good. - That stuff belongs in a bedpan. And what's with all this Scottish stuff? - The game of golf was invented in Scotland. The first great golfer and golf course designer was a Scot, Tom Morris. I figure if I'm gonna be the first lassie to win the British Open, I've got to harness the Scottish in my blood. - Honey, why don't you try harnessing some of the French in your blood from your mother's side of the family? Look what I gotcha. See? Now maybe you can concentrate and set your sights on winning the Tour de France. You can say bonjour instead of cheerio, you can eat souffle instead of haggis. - Here's your clubs, Ella. You left them at Uncle Hal's. And I'm totally wasted from carrying them home. It's toxic enough I gotta caddy for those rich dudes all day, but to schlep your iron around, that's maximum wack. - Ella? What do you have to say for yourself? - Thanks for the ride, Uncle Hal. - Aren't you forgetting something? - That wasn't a fair bet, man! You didn't tell me that you had your golf cart turbo charged. - What's life without a few gambles? Ah. Selling like hotcakes, I see. What's this one called? - JFK. - Very creative. And what's this one called? - Oh, this is a self portrait. - I see. [whimsical music] Oh. I like this. What's its title? - "Boob Descending a Staircase." - Where's the staircase? - What are you doing here? - Have you considered my proposal? - Forget it, I am not selling the mini putt to you. - This is a sure thing! I'm offering you twice what it's worth. Your family deserves better than living in this eyesore. - Go for it, Dad. Uncle Hal is right. We could blow outta this dumpola big time. - Don't do it, Dad. This is me birthplace, the home of our clan. I love it here. - What's the matter, Thomas? Can't get the little ball in the hole? - I will never sell this place to you! - Oh, really? - Really! [laughing] - I was playing 9 holes with your bank president the other day, I like him. He's a betting man. Anyway, he said your balloon payment is due. You're going to lose this property by the end of the week anyway, why not keep it in the family? - I don't consider you family. Now get off my property! - Take this deal! I don't want you blowing it a second time. [whimsical music] [door creaks] [yelling] [objects falling] Sounds like you lost your marbles, Tom. [laughing] - Oh, rank! What is it, technicolor toss? - Don't ask. - It's haggis. - Just for that, you can forget about all that work fixing up my fleet of golf carts. - Great. That means we'll never raise enough money to make the loan payment. - Oh, tune out your brother. The man's a pig, he doesn't know what he's talking about. - Ella, why don't you try out the bike? Listen to that. [wheel spinning] Isn't it beautiful? Smooth as silk. [bagpipe music] - Ugh, I hate that music! Mom, quick, where's my Walkman? - You left it right next to Mr. Microphone. [hard rock music] [trash falling] - Heath? - When I get this guitar I'm gonna go from caddying for snobs to Cadillacs with babes. - Is that you, lad? [whimsical music] [tense music] [wondrous music] Lordy! Puny dinosaurs! I thought you beasties were extinct. [wondrous music] Elvis? What kind of name is that for you to be having? [dinosaur chattering] And you. You look like you belong in Loch Ness. Paula, is it? Jagger. And Hammer. Sure, indeed! I'm such a twit. You guys are named after rock singers. Too bad none of you crooners are named after Rod Stewart. Or better yet, the greatest rock group in history... You know, the great Scottish band, the Bay City Rollers! [dinosaurs chattering] [dinosaur screeches] You want a little gamin' I see. Sure indeed, I'll play around. You can go first, you wee beastie. [lighthearted music] [loud clang] Now that's what I call a blooming good shot! This is more fun than a Sean Connery film festival. I never knew I could have such a bonny time playing putt putt. Me father and uncle always told me it was a bunch of fiddle-faddle. It might even be good practice, to boot. [whimsical music] Blast. I'm such a twit. Well, at least I did not break another window this time. [lighthearted music] [dinosaur screeching] Who am I fooling? This lassie's never gonna be gaming in the British Open. [dinosaur chattering] Stop your blatherskite. It's true. I just don't have what it takes. Look, even a wee dinosaur's better than me. I'll prove it to ya. I'll have another go at it and I'll rug it again. [whimsical music] [dinosaur screeching] [laughing] [loud clang] You loons! [chuckles] You cheated. [dinosaurs chattering] Fine, I'll try it once more. But I cannot concentrate. I'm having such a merry time. [whimsical music] [loud clang] [dinosaur screeching] That was a bonny shot! Let's try another hole. [whimsical music] This is place is awful doomy. Me dad should really clean it up. [door creaks] Great Scott! What's this? [trash falls] - Huh? - Blooming putter of stone! And it's made by William Mayne. The best club maker in Edinburgh. It must be hundreds of years old. [grunting] - What's going on out there? - Blast! It's me dad. He'll kill me if he finds I've been gaming out here. He hates beasties more than golf, so let's hide. [dinosaurs chattering] Come on, let's go. Come on, guys. Come on. [tense music] - Ella, are you out here? Oh, no. Who uncovered this piece of junk? [dinosaurs chattering] What was that? [whimsical music] [laughing] Golf will be the death of me! [dinosaur squeals] Oh, no! We got rats. [dinosaur squealing] [windmill screeches] Oh, what an irritating noise! You look like you need some oiling. [whimsical music] Ella? - Top of the evening to ya! - Ella, what are you doing out here? You were playing golf back there. - I can't help it. It's in me blood. - Well, I thought you said you were gonna try out the bike I fixed up for ya. Well, I see you found the right place for it, with the other scrap metal. [lighthearted music] [grunting] - I don't know what's wrong with it. Battery has a full charge. [grunting] - It is going to be magnificent. The Hal MacGregor Golf Pro Resort and Spa. It's an excellent investment, Mr. Yamamoto. Sake. What's the matter? He isn't saying anything. - You've insulted him by rushing into business. The Japanese like to be entertained first. - You want to bet? $20 says you're wrong. - You're on. Mr. Yamamoto. You're an avid golf enthusiast, perhaps you can tell me something. Why does Arnold Palmer always wear two sweaters? In case he gets a hole-in-one. [laughing] He's as cold as sushi. Didn't even crack a smile. [whimsical music] - Something the matter, Mr. Yamamoto? Oh, that eyesore. Of course. We would never build our resort next to that dump. I will have acquired that property by the end of the week, we'll bulldoze right over it. - [Thomas] Face it, Michelle, she's a strange girl. She's not acting herself. - [Michelle] So what? You haven't been yourself since Reagan took office. - [Thomas] Oh, you're nuts. Now I know where Ella gets it. - [Michelle] Oh, sometimes you make me so mad- - What? Michelle, put the welder's torch down. Michelle, put it down! [yelling] [melancholic music] - Sean. Sean. Where did I go wrong? [melancholic music] What are you calling this work of art, Mom? - You'll probably guess in a sec. Here, help me with this, okay? Hold that. Ooh. - So, what's the tale of that bonny putter and the stone out back? - Yeah. Why don't we take a break, okay? - Okay. - That was your old man's putter. - I don't believe it. - Oh, it's true. Your pop was one of the greatest amateur golfers on the planet. I followed him around like he was Jerry Garcia from tournament to tournament. Man, what a trip that was. - So, why does he gripe about golf so much? - Oh, he kinda burnt out of the Pro-Am finals at Pebble Beach. Man, that was a bad scene. See... The top 2 golfers of the tournament would get to do their thing at the PGA circuit. It was your dad's lifelong dream to get a gig as a pro golfer. Well, your Uncle Hal was already in with a seven under par. Well anyway, your father only had to sink a 4 foot putt to be able to go pro too. Everything looked totally cool. - So, what happened, Mom? - Well, dig this. Your father normally had nerves made of iced tea. But just as he made his putt, a bird chirped. Well, it was more like a freaky squeak actually, and your father missed his putt. Man, it was a total bummer. He's never been able to pick up a golf club since that day. - What a shame. - [Michelle] Yeah, it's a bummer, man, real bummer. - So, what about the putter? - Well, I'm getting to that. As you know, your Uncle Hal was willed the country club, and your father inherited this pad. Anyway... All the castles and the moats and stuff gave me this far out inspiration to create the putter in the concrete. You know, like Excalibur, King Arthur's sword. Well, I hope that it would inspire your father to get it together and golf again. Well, my masterpiece had the opposite vibe. He hated that club so much he dumped a scrap load of metal on it. - And that's how the mini putt became a scrapyard. Mom, why didn't you tell me this before? - Well, honey, your dad didn't want you to know. He thought that you'd think he was a total failure. Anyway, help me with this. Here we go. Now, can you tell what it is? - Is it another sculpture of Uncle Hal? - No. It's a Brachiosaurus. This symbolizes how our mini putt has gone the way of the dinosaur. - So has our home. [chuckling] - How true that is. [dramatic music] - Hey, beasties. Do you want some haggis? [dinosaurs grunting] [lighthearted music] [metal scraping] [dinosaur screeching] What are you devils up to? [loud clanging] [dinosaur screeching] Smashing idea, beasties! [lighthearted music] [whimsical music] [loud clang] - Ha ha, hole in one! - This is much more fun than playing bridge! - And Marco Polo. - How's this thing work? - That'll be $3, laddie. Oh no, let me see if I can break a 20. [lighthearted music] I'm talking about making change you little beasties. Good thing I have me Scotch tape. Here you go. Want the yellow ball? - When the old man wakes up, you're gonna be in major trouble. - Stop your fretting, Heath. He'll be merry when he finds out how much money I'm making. - With 5 customers? Not. - I plan to make a bundle on concessions. [chuckling] Look, here comes a customer now. - What do you have to eat? - We have a special on haggis. - What's haggis? - You'll love it. I'll give you a free sample. Here you go. [dinosaur grunting] One order of haggis. [dinosaur grunting] [lighthearted music] - If I were you, I'd skip the haggis, little man. - Heath. - You'd make more dinero selling tickets to your bagpipe concert, all right? Ciao. - Ella! What's going on here? I thought I said no golf! Here. Let me have that stupid thing. [whimsical music] [water splashes] [wondrous music] - Wow. Putt putt golf and a floor show. - This is comedy club compared to country club. [whimsical music] - Dad, I was just trying to help you out a wee bit with paying the bank loan. Would you give me a blooming chance? I can earn some more money. - Oh, forget it! Maybe I should sell this place, I hate golf. - That's not true, Dad. I know you love golf, and I know you're a great golfer. And I want to be as good as you. I want you to teach me. But we can't do that we if we lose this home. And there's something else you should know, I had a little help fixing up the park. [whimsical music] [dinosaurs chattering] They're miniature dinosaurs. I don't know where they came from. I know you hate animals, so please- - You want me to keep the putt putt and these dinosaurs? What do you think this is, Dino Putt? Hey, wait a minute, that's it! Dino Putt! We'll make a fortune! [laughing] where'd they come from? - I just love happy endings.

[laughing] - That was a one time command performance. - How bout her? She's quite a Betty. - Ha, sorry, no floor show. - Aw! That was the best part about being here. - Well, hey, wait a minute. Where you going? We got something even better. Try out one of our complimentary Dino Burgers. Serve 'em up, four hungry golfers, hot off the griddle. You can't beat 'em, huh? - These are great! - You like 'em? [laughing] Tell your friends! Hey, they're selling like hot cakes. What are you putting in those burgers? - Haggis helper. - Business is going great. A few more days like this and we'll be able to make the bank payment. - You know, you're right. Hey, let me try one of those Dino Burgers. - Putter! Putter! - Hey man, carrying the golf clubs around again today? What happened to your golf cart? [laughing] - Would you very kindly shut up? You are louder than the noise from that miniature golf course owned by that dreadful deadbeat loser. - He's not a loser, okay? My dad was one of the best amateur golfers to ever play the game. Pfft, he's a wicked better golfer than you'll ever be, Hackmeister. - How dare you address me in that manner! What kind of caddy are you? - A retired caddy. I'm not lugging around 30 pounds of iron in 90 degree heat for some uppity twink anymore. I'm truckin'. - Where do you think you're going? - To the putt putt to get a real job, Needlenose. - You pick those clubs up now, boy. - You pick 'em up. - Impotence of the man! Did you hear what he said? How dare he. Oh, jolly good! I can play through with your caddy now. - All right, I know I was a major dooker to you Ella, but I'll do anything to get a job around here, okay? - Anything? [men yelling] [laughing] - Hey, dudes, the benefits are great! [whimsical music] [dinosaurs grunting] - Maybe I should give cycling a try. I'm washed up as a golfer. - Oh, you're wrong now, lassie. You make a mighty fine golfer. You just gotta learn the secrets of the game, then you'll be loggin'. - Dad! - Now your stroke is perfect, but your noggin' isn't. You think too much. Choose one happy thought and keep it in your skull whenever you putt. Now go ahead, try it again. Happy thought. - Happy thought. [dinosaur grunting] [whimsical music] [dinosaur cheering] - Bonny shot! And what was your happy thought, Daughter? - I pictured you picking up a golf club again. - Ah, well I say you have an active imagination. How about a dram of ginger? - Urn Brew. Imported from Scotland. My favorite. Cheers to us, and those like us. Darn few, they're all dead and more's a pity. - Ha, well put! Ah, now that's good. [dinosaur screeching] Ah! I know dinosaurs may be good for business, but I'm not so sure I like them as pets, lass. [lighthearted music] - Needlemeyer. Mr. Yamamoto has not said one word all day. - They say laughter is the best medicine. Try another one of my jokes on him. Here's a good one. Who makes the best golfers? Belly dancers, because they never move their heads. [laughing] - He's been staring out at that miserable miniature golf course all day long. - The putt putt has been busy all day, the profits must be astronomical. - I need to get my hands on that eyesore before Mr. Yamamoto decides to withdraw his investment in the Hal MacGregor Golf Pro Resort and Spa, you understand me, Needlemeyer? Needlemeyer, straighten up and fly right. I want you to fix it so that mini putt goes bye bye. [lighthearted string music] - Ah, this stuff may smell like my grandmother, but the deep heating rub feels so good. [lighthearted string music] [dinosaur screeching] - What's up, Madonna? Oh, no! Needlemeyer. - Good of you to beam down, Scotty. Now I can kick your anus. - This will be more fun than when the Scots beat the English in the Battle of Bannockburn. [grunting] Take that! [grunting] - I don't think so. Get the point? - Your spikes are as short and as dull as the stubble on your face. - You really burn me up. So, I think I'll return the favor. [growling] [whimsical music] [liquid dripping] [dinosaur laughing] [panting] [water splashes] - I guess something else caught on fire. [dinosaur screeching] [dinosaur laughing] - I don't know. They looked like little dinosaurs. But they... They could've been rats. - Rats, you say? Needlemeyer, zip up your fly. [liquid dripping] Ugh. Get a grip, man! We've got something important to do. - [Woman] Come on, kids. - [Man] Nice shot. How many are you on this hole? - You better appreciate this, because I hate animals, even though you are cute little dinosaurs. Critters are always making squeaky noises that I hate. Get in there and keep quiet. [tense music] Ella, take this. - [Ella] What's going on? - It's the critters, hide them. [Thomas claps] Well! Howdy, howdy. Care for a game, sir? - George Stutts. Department of Public Health. We've received a tip that there may be a possible vermin infestation on this premises. - Hal. - Ah, you should thank your brother. Rats can pose an enormous health hazard. - Believe me, there are no rats or any other animals on these premises, I make sure of that. Oh, no, no. I can't stand critters of any shape or size. Tell the man that, Hal. - Sorry, Tom, this place is a health hazard. I bet Stutts would find more mice here than at Disneyland. - This ball is covered with teeth marks. See? Larger than anything I've ever seen before. - Um- - Ah, nah, nah. This is a big problem. Massive problem. [sighs] Attention. Attention. These premises must be cleared. This putt putt has been quarantined by the Department of Public Health. Let's move, people! - What a gyp! I want my money back! - Look- - Yeah! First no floor show, and now this! - Oh! [kid farts] Hurry back, gentleman. - This is a handheld, ultrasonic, bio-audio receiving device. [laughing] Yeah, you can't buy one of those babies in Radio Shack. - How does this work? - It's an ultra-sensitive microphone, Hal! [chuckles] With it, I can hear the breath, heartbeat, or growl of any creature within a hundred yard radius. [lighthearted music] Strange. You're not registering a heartbeat, Hal. - Ha. [laughing] - Must be my nerves of steel. [laughing] - But Thomas, your heart is just racing. Are you nervous about something? - Of course not. - Well... Hm. Try and relax. I'll find your rat problem in no time. [lighthearted music] Uh huh. [laughing] Yeah. Yeah. Mhm, mm, mm! Bingo! [laughing] I found you, you little vermin. Right category, wrong species. What are you doing here, kid? - I just wanted to play another round. - Ah, really? - What's going on? - Helping out little critters is one thing, but I never thought I'd be doing this. [door creaking] - Wait, wait, wait a second, hold it. Oh, I'm getting something. Oh, fantastic. Would you listen to all those squeaks? Hal, Hal, Hal, come, look, look. Oh, oh, oh, ooh. That's unbelievable. Wait a minute, oh, massive, massive. Massive vermin activity taking place. But where? Huh, huh, huh? In the house! It's in the house. [tense music] Strange. Pretty strange. The signal was pinning the needle, but I couldn't find any rats anywhere. They must've dispersed when they saw me approach. That's it, yeah, that's it. Oh. These premises are under strict quarantine until I can come back with some equipment that's a little less primitive than this. Strange, very strange. - Tough break, Thomas. Just when you had a chance to pay back your loan. Listen, you're still my brother, and even though there is a vermin problem here, my offer still stands to buy the property. - I'll never sell. - Just think about it. The deck is stacked against you, you don't want to blow it again. - Don't listen to him, Thomas. [somber music] [dinosaur screeching] - [Commentator] Beautiful approach shot. Nice pitch to the green here. It looks like he's got, what do you say, about an 18 footer? - [Commentator] A little over 17. - [Commentator] Okay. Looks like a slight break to the left here, he's probably gonna push it just to the left edge. These greens are fairly fast. It will be a tricky one. Here we go. - [Commentator] He's addressing the ball. [bird chirps] - [Commentator] It's moving... Oh, oh! [groaning] Just heartbreaking. - Poor Dad. He lost the golf tournament to Uncle Hal, now he's gonna lose the mini putt? If we just knew what Uncle Hal was up to, we might be able to do something. Did you know plaid was originally designed by the Scottish as camouflage? - Who cares? I can't believe you talked me into this. - Be thankful for Dad's kilt. It might help you hide. [chuckling] - I look like a mega dork. - Relax. Didn't you know Axl Rose sometimes wears a kilt? - Axl Rose as in Guns & Roses? Cool. Why did we bring these guys along anyway? - They can be a big help in a tight spot. Quick! Hide, Heath? - Where? - Use your kilt! - I hate patrolling without the golf carts. - Ow, my legs are tired. Hey! - What? - Let's bag this and build a castle in the sand trap! - Oh, that's a great idea! - Yeah! - These kilts are pretty cool. A little drafty though. - Please, pardon our plebeian surroundings. When Hal MacGregor Golf Pro Resort and Spa is built, we'll have a giant dining room and grand ballroom. [whimsical music] - Oh. [claps] Excellent. I'm starved. I haven't eaten all day. I love sushi, don't you? - [Hal] Needlemeyer! [dinosaur screeching] - Who's that guy with Uncle Hal? - I don't know. Wayne Newton? - You are not going to eat with us. I have enough problems as it is. I think Mr. Yamamoto is going to withdraw his investment unless I can get my hands on that miserable mini putt in a hurry. Now, the last thing I need is you embarrassing me with your problem. - Oh, come on, just a couple of bites. - Get outta here. [whimsical music] And stay away from the sodas, you know what that does to ya. [dinosaur screeching] [whimsical music] - Where did Elvis and Paula go? [dinosaur screeching] [dinosaur drinking] [whimsical music] [dinosaur burping] Elvis, no! [dinosaur screeching] [chuckling] - I misjudged you, Mr. Yamamoto. You do have a sense of humor. - Paula, don't do it. [water spraying] [whimsical music] - I get it. This is a test. Humility is a great virtue in your society. You want to see how humble I can be before you partner with me? Thank you, Yamamoto-san, please, dump on me some more. Thank you. [water spraying] I'm your humble servant. Ah. [dinosaur chattering] Poise under pressure, that's the mark of a champion. Just catch your breath and walk it off. Excuse me a moment. Poise under pressure, that's the mark of a champion. Poise under pressure, that's the mark of a champion. - Shh. - You! I knew it all along. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. [chuckling] You're just the people I want to talk to. I have an offer you can't refuse. - Forget it. - You haven't even heard it yet. - Let me guess. You want us to talk our dad into selling you the mini putt. - Bright girl. And in return, I can fulfill your dreams. Heath. How would you like that most righteous electric guitar? - How did you know? - Nothing escapes my eye. I learned it as a pro golfer, always know the lay of the land. I'll buy you that guitar, and you can have your old caddy job back at twice the pay. In no time, you'll be able to finance your own rock band, go on tour. You'll have what you want most. Appreciation for that now untapped artistic talent, and escape from that miserable dump of a mini putt. And you, Ella. Your dream of being a pro golfer, I can make it happen, I can get you lessons with PGA golfers. I'll sponsor you, you'll travel to all the amateur tournaments. And when the time comes, you'll have a friend on the rules committee to get you in to the men's tour and that fabled British Open. You'll have the respect that you deserve. - Forget it. - Don't blow this big chance like your father did, think it over. No matter how much you fix up that miserable miniature golf course of yours, all it'll ever be is a mecca for kiddies, loser duffers, and low class hackers. Let's face it. Mini putt is the freak show of golf. - And you're the dark prince of golf. You don't love the sport like I do, you only want to exploit it for money. I'll never turn. Come on, Heath. - I'm sorry, Ella, Uncle Hal here spoke some righteous words. I think we should cut our losses. - If you do this now, in one way or another, you're gonna be carrying baggage for him for the rest of your life. Let me go. [dramatic music] - You need a reality check, Dad. You're gonna lose the property anyway. Why don't you just sell it to Uncle Hal now, at least you'll get a bunch of dinero. - Uncle Hal has him under his thumb. If we sell the mini putt, we'll be just like he. - Well, I hate to admit it, but we don't have any other choice, Ella. - Your father's right. I'm sorry, dear. - There must be something else we can do. [lighthearted music] [dinosaurs chattering] I don't get it. Putt? [buzzer sounds] One word. [bell rings] One syllable. [bell rings] [dinosaurs chattering] Sounds like... [bell rings] Pet. [dinosaur chattering] Jet? [buzzer sounds] Debt. [buzzer sounds] Bet! [bell ringing] [dinosaurs chattering] I get it. Dad, make a bet with Uncle Hal. This Japanese guy has him desperate to get his hands on our property. - Well, what good is that gonna do us? - If Uncle Hal wins, we sell him the property. If he loses, he pays off our bank loan. - Do you think he'll really go for it? - Definitely. Uncle Hal's addicted to gambling. - What's the bet? - A game of miniature golf. Winner takes all. - Oh no, forget it. Uncle Hal's a golf pro, I haven't touched a club in 15 years. Forget it. - Then I'll play him. You said I was pretty good. And I know the course better than anyone. - I said no, and this time I want you to listen to me. - But why? - Because I don't want what happened to me to happen to you. When I missed that putt 15 years ago, I didn't just lose the tournament, I lost my spirit. Ella. - Why'd you have to miss that stupid putt? Why? Stupid putter. This is all your fault. [wondrous music] [dinosaurs chattering] [thunder rumbles] I won't lose, I promise. - That's the bet? [laughing] It's more like a killing. [laughing] - It was all my idea too. - Excellent. Your sister doesn't stand a chance against me, Hal MacGregor, golf pro. Tell your father I accept. Needlemeyer. You remember that little arrangement we cooked up at the Kemper Open? I want you to set it up. - You're going to cheat? I thought you said this was a sure thing. - I probably won't have to, she's only a young girl. I just want a little insurance policy, that's all. - Uncle Hal, I almost forgot, could we pick up that guitar after the match? - Do you think he heard the part about the insurance policy? - I don't know. But I'll find out. [dramatic music] [grunting] [laughing] - Is it safe? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Is it safe? - Yeah, yeah, it's safe, it's safe as it's ever gonna be. Just don't do it, please, come on! [laughing] - Is it safe? - No, no, it's not safe. I mean, I don't know! - Well, if you don't know whether it's safe or not, I have to at least know that you're loyal. You have to become one of us. - No! - Where's Dad? - He's too nervous to watch. He's waiting inside, honey. - Oh, this is gonna be a real nail biter. Pardon me, I mean tail biter. [drum hit] [tense music] - Needlemeyer. While everyone is watching the first round, you wire up the 18th hole. - Roger. [tense music] - Guests first. - Oh. You got your dad's old putter. What's that for, luck? [chuckling] [wondrous music] [cheering] - This is great! - It's so exciting. Even my parents decided not to play golf today. - [Michelle] Come on, Ella. [clapping] - [Thomas] Come on, honey, you can do it. - What's the matter? Can't sleep? [dinosaur chattering] Thanks. I need as many fans as I can get. Think your happy thoughts. [tense music] [cheering] [lighthearted music] - Beginner's luck. - Ella's up a stroke! - All right! [cheering] [tense music] [beeping] [laughing] - I love the smell of AstroTurf in the morning. Smells like victory. [lighthearted music] [whimsical music] [Hal cheers] - Son. You take a tip from a pro. Poise under pressure, that's the mark of a champion. - What drama, what suspense! [tense music] [dinosaur screeching] - Lucky putter! [laughing] - I don't know, Madonna. It's getting harder and harder to keep a happy thought in my head when I put. [dinosaur chattering] All right. I'll do my best. [whimsical music] [cheering] - Oh, honey! [cheering] [whimsical music] Ella's down a stroke. - Oh, no! - I think the pressure's getting to her. [dinosaur chattering] [door creaks] [catchy music] ♪ She's gotta have somebody ♪ She's gotta have it all today ♪ ♪ She's gotta have somebody ♪ She's gonna do it all her way ♪ ♪ It's not if you win or lose ♪ But winning's the only game to chose ♪ ♪ When you're somebody ♪ If you're somebody - It's all tied up. - I'm so nervous, I hope I don't toss my Dino Burger. [Hal claps] [whimsical music] - Poise under pressure. Poise under pressure. [tense music] - You'll be fine. [tense music] - Poise under pressure. [tires screeching] - You spoke too soon, Uncle Hal. Don't count your chickens before they hatch. They might turn out to be birdies. [laughing] - I'll have to remember that one. [laughing] [dinosaur chattering] [whimsical music] [birds chirping] [sighs] - I'm sorry, Ella. It's not your fault. It's in your blood to choke under pressure. Wait a minute. Let me have that remote. [dramatic music] Look at this. Frame 161, I'm getting ready to putt. There's one tree in front of me, the only tree within 50 yards. Frame 190. There are no birds present in that tree at this time. Frame 220, Hal joins the crowd on the grassy knoll. Frame 232, I begin to putt. Frame 260, the fatal chirp rings out, my head flinches towards the noise. But look at this. I don't look right towards the tree where the only birds could possibly be, but back and to the left, towards the grassy knoll. See? Back and to the left. Back and to the left. Back and to the left. [dramatic music] My putt was pronounced dead on arrival, and so was my PGA career. But this proves it was not a lone bird chirp. It was a conspiracy! [clapping] [group chattering] - Do it, love. [tense music] [door creaks] - [Woman] Hey! - [Ella] Dad! - Sorry to interrupt your putt, Ella. I just didn't think it was right for Uncle Hal to be smoking during your shot. - [Man] What's that got to do with anything? - We're gonna make history repeat itself. - That was then, this is now. She's still gotta sink the putt. - Are you all right, Ella? We can cancel this whole thing right now. - I can do it. My happy thought just came true. - Hey, you know, you were right. This feels good. Okay, Ella. Let's see that nice, easy stroke. - Be quiet! - [Kid] Stay calm, Ella. [tense music] [screaming] [speaking in foreign language] [grunting] [tense music] [speaking in foreign language] [grunting] [yelling] [dramatic piano music] [cheering] [lighthearted music] - No! - See how easy it is? [Hal yelling] - So, why'd you come back and help? - Well, let's just say I had a close shave at Uncle Hal's, and I realized I was becoming just like one of those biff tads. [laughing] [dinosaurs chattering] - Hi there, folks. Say, I was just wondering, has anybody seen any dinosaurs around here? - Does the word "duh" mean anything to you? - Yeah, as a matter of fact, it does. Considering how many times I've lost those little ol' critters. Well, I'm off. I hope I don't lose them again. - Tell him to wait, wait, wait. Wait! - I thought you already said goodbye to them. - No! I was inside giving them a going away present. - Well, they're gone. I know! [lighthearted music] Hey, Mr. Cranston. Mr. Cranston, wait up! Wait up! Mr. Cranston! [lighthearted music] I'm glad I caught you guys. I wanted to say goodbye. [dinosaurs chattering] Oh, and I wanted to give you this. [lighthearted music] I thought you might want some music for the ride home. [chuckling] Bye. [bagpipe music] [lighthearted music] Bye, Mr. Cranston. - Okay! - Just relax. Ah, how about a round of putt putt? - Smashing! [laughing] That sounds like a bonny time. - Oh, don't tell me you're gonna start rapping bogus about, Bee Girl. - Look who's talking. Okay. How about this? Bonjour, Papa. [laughing] [lighthearted music] - I've been studying your property all week. I want to build a resort around your golf course. It will be the biggest putt putt in the world! And of course, we'll need more of these magnificent sculptures. - No problem! [laughs] - We'll build one in Tokyo, and Russia too. They're in great need of good, cheap fun. - Well, we're game. [chuckling] [lighthearted music] [laughing] - You're a funny man! [laughing] - So, do we have a deal? - There's one condition. - Oh, what's that? - Room service will have to deliver these Dino Burgers 24 hours a day.
