Good evening. You have come to steal from me tonight? [chuckles] I must apologize. He can be a little overprotective at times. I am Herr Goodman. Please. Shadows don't scare me anymore. -[sighs] -[Josef] That's better. [blows air] What was it you were hoping to find? Money? Jewels? My Tréhot? Ah, yes. A beautiful and priceless piece. I wonder, what is it that drives one to... to risk freedom? Or even death? Come here. I promise I will not hurt you, come. Does she, uh, remind you of anyone? My mother. [Josef sighs] I see now. [chuckles softly] Do you know what that is? Your number... from the camps. Millions in the world continue to deny it. I am pleased to hear you acknowledge the truth. I knew I made the right choice. What do you mean? We are not too different, you and I. We both know what it means to... to carry the suffering of our ancestors, hatred of our eternal enemy. You may not take the Renoir tonight, but you may come and enjoy it anytime you like. On one condition. And what is that? Instead of stealing from me, you're going to steal... for me. Gentlemen. Why are you here? Oh, you know me. I couldn't stay away. Retirement doesn't really suit me. Have you tried gardening? A cruise, perhaps? -[Annabel chuckles] -[drink pouring] You know, unless there was a vote to remove me, I believe I'm still a member of this organization. We should have voted you out the moment you failed. I did what I had to do. That was not your decision to make. You know damn well Josef would have destroyed those paintings rather than see them stay in the hands of Nazis. What I don't know is what Josef ever saw in you in the first place. You've never belonged here. You can't ever understand. I'll ask again. Am I not... still the CEO... of this organization? Annabel. [sighs] Welcome home, hmm? You look well. Well, what brings you in? Alek. I found them. I found all of them. -[Aleksander] What? Where? -Yes. Here, they're in Los Angeles. Our resources are no longer at your disposal. I'm not asking for permission. Oh, look, Annabel, I want to honor Josef as much as you do, but I'm afraid I have to agree. No, Alek, listen to me. This is our chance to do everything Josef wanted us to do. The world will not forgive another failure. Oh, after what happened... [exhales] ...we must put our faith and resources in the courts. -[melancholic music playing] -[Vanderhoef sighs] When I first met Josef... we had just arrived at the camp. We were standing in line for our numbers. We were only ten years old, frightened and alone. Being tattooed by strangers. [breathes deeply] When the Americans freed us, we ran away the first chance we got. We walked, we hiked, we rode for four nights back to his home. All he could talk about was getting back to this box. He was like a brother to me. A father to you. So you understand? I made a promise to Josef. One I plan on keeping. Tell us, Annabel, what do you need? -[chuckles] -[resolute music playing] [breathes deeply] -So? -[resolute music concludes] They gave their full support. -No. Seriously? -Yeah. Well, how'd you convince them to trust you again? Not for you to worry about. Now, this is still about stealing paintings -back from Nazis, right? -Of course. The last time it got personal and shit went sideways real fast. Like I said, it's not for you to worry about. -Okay? Now, come on. Come on. -Whoa, where are we going? We need intel. Please, not Lucille. Don't say Lucille. Yes, we're gonna go see Lucille. Come on. [upbeat music playing] [keyboard clacking] [upbeat music concludes] -I'm in. -[keyboard clacking] How are you in? This is the strongest firewall we have. [clicks tongue] I don't know what to tell you. Backdoors, buffer overflow vulnerabilities. [Agent Garcia] Okay, great. How do we fix it? That's not my job. Okay. Do I need to remind you of the conditions of your little work release? [exhales] I'll run diagnostics and have a report to you by tomorrow morning. Your lab rats should be able to close most of the gaps in the firewall. [footsteps receding] [birds chirping] [Eddie] Hey, Luce. [blows kiss] -[Lucille] Eddie, I-- -How have you been? -You look good. -[Lucille hesitates] I... You clearly didn't understand "Stay the hell away from me." -You're still mad at me? -Wow, I-- Wait a minute. If you're here, that means... Hey, Lucille. How you been? [sighs] Surviving. Good. I got a job for you. -I already have a job. -What? Working for the feds? Yeah, well, it pays the bills and keeps me out of jail. We pull this one off, you'll be free and clear. [Lucille] It's the FBI. You don't just make a phone call. Why do you think you're still not in jail right now? [Lucille] Seriously? The Syndicate still has connections in the state capital. We'll be helping each other out. [Lucille] The only person you've ever helped out is yourself. I... I'm not down to go through that shit again with you two. -No, thank you. -You really want to spend the next five to ten years explaining shit to men who aren't even half as smart as you, huh? Come on, Lucy, come on. You're better than that. -I need you, mama. -[sighs] I really need you. -Him too? -I'll deal with him. [grumbles, exhales deeply] [breathes deeply] [suspenseful music playing] -What are we stealing? -A painting. -Four paintings. -Wait, what? -Four? -Four paintings. Come on. -Let's go. -[Lucille chuckles] Four paintings? -So, who's the mark? -[Annabel] Otto Huizen. A German venture capitalist whose investments are focused on trying to create a neo-Nazi Fourth Reich. -Sounds like a piece of work. -[Annabel] Yeah, he's sadistic. And you're sure he has all four paintings? Yeah. [whooshing] [Annabel] Huizen recently had a business meeting with Uriel Kantor. -The Russian oligarch? -Yup, that's him. [keyboard clacking] After a few bottles of vodka, they started trying to compare whose billions were bigger. [Eddie] And priceless pieces of artwork came to mind. [Annabel] Huizen was bragging about missing paintings only he gets to look at. [scoffs] A Russian and a Nazi. What could go wrong? He's more than just a Russian. He's Jewish. [Annabel] His uncles were at Auschwitz, -same time as Josef. -[keyboard clacking] -So what's the play? -[exhales] Okay, I'm gonna spam his company's email server with a weaponized PDF. I mean, it won't take long for one of his idiot employees to click on it. And then the real fun begins. [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music concludes] [computer beeping, chirping] -Whoo! Got you! -[Eddie] Whoa, what the hell? -Got you. -[Eddie] You okay? -Oh, I am better than okay. -[keyboard clacking] Hook, line, and sinker, baby. I... I now have access to their network and their login credentials. [mellow music playing] And their network. [sighs sharply] [breathes deeply, clears throat] -[clears throat] So, uh... -[mellow music concludes] [clicks tongue] -You were saying, um... -Yeah, I was say-- I'm in. I'm... I can see everything. -What's everything? -Everything, everything. Um, emails, banking info, purchase history, -browser history-- -Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. You... you can do that? You can, like, see what websites he looks at? I... I could. That's a little scary. I bet he looks up a lot of weird shit. What... what do you... what do you mean? You know, rich guys like him, they all got their freaky shit they're into. You know, I bet he looks up some, uh, like, bondage, S&M type shit or something. Oh. Well, if you think that's freaky, then you need to get out more often. Oh, yeah? Well, that doesn't sound like the Lucy I remember. Hmm, if you only knew. Okay, now get out of here. You're making me hot. -Like I'm hot, I'm hot. -I knew it, I know. Go, please. [lips sputter] [upbeat pop music playing] [Annabel] Hey, hey. [Lucille over phone] Hey, I gotta make this quick. So, one of his dumbass lackeys clicked on the fake file. It transmitted identifying packets that I ran through a decryption program, I pwned his network. -[Eddie] You what? -[Lucille] It... it means I made it my own. I own it. Any security systems will be online and I'll be able to disable and intercept any alarms. -All right, I gotta go, bye. -[Annabel] Hey, good work. Now, let's go steal us some blueprints. [upbeat music concludes] Welcome, I'm Victoria. What can we design for you? -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. This is my assistant, Nathan, and we're looking to build a new weekend house on the Northern Coast. Excellent, if you'll follow me, we can head back to our conference room and take a look at a few designs. [Annabel] Thank you. ["Gonna Be Successful" playing] Excuse me, Victoria?

So, I started searching for other similar purchases and found that he owns a Gateway Super Defender TRX. It's one of the best home safes out there. [both] We need a locksmith. Well, there's more. The security cameras around the house are IP cameras. I've been streaming the feeds of each one. I've counted no less than half a dozen guards on the property. We're gonna need a wildcard too. -Really? You sure? -[Annabel] Yeah. Definitely. What about Ricky? Not up for parole for another... 18 months. -Max? -Got out, retired. I might know a guy. Okay, fine. Get him. I'm gonna go see Nadia.

Mm-hmm. How about a challenge? I've known you for a very long time. [Annabel] Mm-hmm. And you know damn well you can't challenge me. -Really? -Yeah. How about a Gateway Super Defender. Residential, heavily guarded, high stakes. Five, ten minutes tops. That safe is 20 man-hours resistant and you want me to break into it in under ten minutes?

What are you doing in, uh, Skid Row, huh? Still striking the fear of God into children, I see? Ah, you know, the little shit wanted to buy a phone, then he thinks he can just take off with it. Fucking kids these days. The hell are you doing at a pawn shop? You make good money here? Uh, you know, old man pays cash to keep the crackheads and the tweakers out. You want a real job? Big payday. You pulling your own work now? Not yet. Still with my same crew. Yeah. Always play second fiddle, staying in the same place too long. Thanks for the career advice. You in? [exhales sharply] Whose ass I gotta kick, huh? Okay, so, Huizen's property is set up like a compound. It sits right on the water and we're gonna take advantage of that, okay? We're gonna moor here, and these rocks shouldn't be difficult to get up. Oh, why... by the water? I mean, why not just approach on foot? [Lucille] Well, the back patio is the least guarded side of the house. There are two guards at the front door around the clock, two guards in the driveway, and another guard inside the house that roams the first floor. A fourth one takes care of the back patio about every 35 or 45 minutes. If we time it right, we can get in the house undetected. [clicks tongue] Assume there's sliding patio doors? Yep. We see them in the main floor camera -and the back patio camera. -[Eddie] Nadia? Sliding glass doors usually have a mortise bolt lock. Easy to get into, but I'll be ready for anything heavier. Okay, good. Once in, we have to subdue the first floor guard. Hmm. Leave that to me. We just need him incapacitated, not hurt. How do you expect me to drop someone without hurting him? Just a tiny bit. -I mean... -A little bit. I... I can do it. I know a little jujitsu. -[Bruno] A little? -Yeah. -[Bruno] Well, congratulations. -Can you do it? -I think I can handle it. -All right. We'll find the safe and then Nadia will be up. Uh, what about Huizen? [smacks lips] We hit the house when he's not home. Luce? Yeah, his secretary keeps his calendar in the cloud. He'll be in San Francisco next weekend. -Just the guards will be there. -We could be in and out without any of the other guards ever knowing we were there. Then it's set. Lucille will disable the alarm from here and override all the camera feed, creating a new loop of clean feed. Wait a second. You're coming? [chuckles] Yeah, I'm coming. Why shouldn't I? Uh... Oh, I don't know. -Um, it's just, uh, um... -[chuckles] [scoffs] What? 'Cause she's a woman? Um, it's just that... -Wow. Um... -Don't look at me, man, you're digging your own grave here. -Yeah, okay. -Okay, you... you're funny. You're real funny, bro, but, um, I've been waiting on this score for a long time, so there's no way I'm gonna be missing it, okay? So... [clicks tongue] No, hey, uh, it's cool. It's awesome. Love it. I don't have to be the fastest. I just gotta outrun you. Oh, even in heels, you can't outrun me, okay? So, yeah. -[chuckles] -[Annabel laughs] All right. Back to work. [upbeat music playing] -Annabel. -[grunts] Get my fucking purse! [henchman] Let's go... [upbeat music concludes] -Ah, Miss Gomez. -[classical music playing] It's a pleasure to finally meet you. Please, sit. Do you know there's an actual bounty on your head? -The Kerrs? -Yeah. Seems retribution is the price for their destroyed Monet. -How much? -The Monet? -[Annabel] The bounty? -Half million. -Coffee? -[Annabel] No, thank you. Tell me. Why destroy such a priceless piece of artwork? You know who the Kerrs are and where they're from. Ah, so, their ideology gives you the right to take and destroy what is theirs? It's not theirs, it was stolen. -Really? -[Annabel] Yeah. From whom? When? It was taken from the Rosenbaum family during the Nazi plunder of France. Sound familiar? -Never heard of such a thing. -[Annabel] No? What about the execution of six million Jews? I bet you've never heard of that either, huh? I should turn you over to the Kerrs right now and collect the bounty. So, what are you waiting for? I take pleasure in watching you chase after things you cannot have, things that are not yours. You're right. They're not mine. They belong to the world and I'm gonna give them back. I'm gonna give them all back. -Even yours. -[scoffs] You can't possibly believe that. You will never get my paintings. The world is not worthy of them. Only a superior people deserve such fine art. Oh. Well. When you're ready to collect on that bounty, you know where to find me. Your arrogance intrigues me. Come for my paintings. And then you fail, then I'll collect the bounty. Till then. [Annabel] Excuse me. [tense music playing] -[Eddie] Hey. -Hey. We need to talk. [tense music fades] [Eddie] Are you okay? -What happened in there? -I'm fine. The Kerrs are on me. They want payback for destroying the Monet. [Eddie] Shit! And now he knows we're coming. Relax, okay? I got this. He showed his hand. He has the paintings, we stick to the plan. Jesus, what are we walking into here, Annie? Just be straight with me. Is this just another Syndicate job? -[tense music playing] -What paintings are we stealing? A Monet, a Degas, Picasso, and a Van Gogh. Fuck. I knew it. Josef's paintings. We've been through some shit, Annie, and God knows I owe you, but I ain't ready to die for some paintings. Well, I'm not sorry because I made a promise. A promise that I'm willing to die for. You know you gotta sit this one out now. -No, no way. -Annabel, you've been made-- -[Annabel] No! No. -[Eddie] You've been made and it's the only way we move forward. [exhales] We decided it would be better off if Annabel didn't come along. Why the sudden change? Look, we can't take any chances on this one, okay? We think it's best if I make the plays from here, keep eyes and ears on everything, and if something goes south, I can bail you out. Okay, but what's the backup plan? Lucille? Yeah. Uh... I can... I can do it. No, okay, I can do Annabel's part and mine. Thanks though, sweetheart. I appreciate the team effort. [groans] [screams] [groans] -[laughs] Holy shit! -[Annabel] Damn! -Look at him! -[Bruno chuckles strainingly] -I can get-- -I said I got it. -I could get-- -There you go. Good job, mama. All right, come on, stop fucking around. Let's go. Focus. That was good, mama. Show him you can kick his ass, that's right. [pensive music playing] [sighs] [exhales deeply] [Eddie] So, you think she can handle it? Yeah, absolutely. You know, I understand what these paintings mean to you. No, I don't think you do. I was 18. Living in the streets, stealing everything I could that wasn't nailed to the floor just to survive. I was good at it. And I'd heard about this old Jewish guy that had a stash of cash in the safe. I went there to steal it. And hanging on the wall in the office was this painting, this... It was a Renoir. It was beautiful. I was... I was just mesmerized by this, the beauty of this woman in this painting. It was just visceral and so powerful to me. Did you steal it? No. [chuckles softly] Josef caught you? Josef saved me. I don't know how, but he planned the whole thing. [sniffles] [sighs] Josef was like a father to me. He was my mentor. He taught me everything I know. He believed he could heal the world of all its pain through art and he wanted to give back all the beauty that was stolen by the Nazis. [sniffles] You think it'll still work? [sniffles] Those four paintings belonged to Josef's family and he spent his whole life searching for them, so it has to work. This is the only chance we're gonna get, Eddie. We got a big problem. -[tense music playing] -[keyboard clacking] [Annabel] Lucille, what's going on? They're-- -What? -They're hack-backing me. They're... they're hacking my system. Who could possibly be hacking you? Okay, so what can we do? Should we pull the plug or something? No, no, no, no, no. If we do that, I... I'll never know who it was, what they've seen, what they've taken. -What if you tried-- -[indistinct chatter] Everyone just needs to shut up and let me work. [keyboard clacking] That's it. Yeah, I-- They've... -[Annabel] What's happening? -Shit, I'm... I'm locked out. -They've... -[Annabel] What? [Lucille sighs] They... they changed everything. They're onto us. They know we're coming. [Nadia yelling] How? Fuck. Fuck! [mutters indistinctly] [Eddie] Annabel! [tense music concludes] -[melancholic music playing] -[footsteps approaching] [exhales] [sniffles] Josef. [sobs] I'm so sorry. [melancholic music fades] Nice. [speaking Spanish] -[in English] Eat. -Okay, bro. Uh... Are you gonna... you gonna hurry up a little bit? I gotta check my email. I gotta update my blog. -You know, I got followers... -Hey, Luce? Am I reading this right? Yeah. Yeah, those are the invoices. I thought you said you were locked out. No, I am, that's just from the data mine I did of their servers and cloud. What's "Safe Domains"? That's the company that services the safe at the house. [mouse clicking] Hold on a second. The invoices are dated two days ago. Wait, the service wasn't done at the house, it was done at a different address. Do you think he moved the paintings? I mean, it would make sense to. If he knew we knew where they were. Yeah, there's the threat of us alerting the authorities... -[Lucille] Guys. -...and a guy like Huizen -would be threatened by that... -[Lucille] Guys. ...he'd need something bigger. -Guys! -What? A moving company specializing in the crating and packaging of fine arts was at the house the next day. -Where's the address? -Right here in downtown L.A. What? Oh, my God! Yes! Yes. [chuckles] Good job. Nadia, we're in business, baby. -Yes! -We got some work to do. -All right! -Good. Good. 'Cause I was this close -to finding myself another team. -[Annabel clicks tongue] Can I check my, uh, email, update my blog? You good? -No? I can do it later. -[indistinct chatter] [Lucille sighs] [exhales] Annabel. I just... I... I just wanted to apologize. I... I don't know how they found me in their network. -I don't blame you. -[Lucille clears throat] -Lucy, it wasn't your fault. -I just... -What are you doing? -I don't know what happened. They should've never known I was there. Lucy, don't worry about it. We're gonna be okay, all right? -Come on, Annabel. -Yo. -Seriously? What the hell? -Leave it alone. -It's fine. -Oh, fuck that. You can't let her think she messed up. -It wasn't her fault. -Yo, you guys want tacos... -It's not gonna help. -Bullshit. Her confidence is shaken and we need her solid. Since when the fuck do you give a shit about her feelings? All right, someone tell me what the hell is going on right now or I walk. -They didn't find you, Lucille. -Don't. -They found her. -What? She was made two days ago. -Huizen cornered her. -[groans] There's a bounty on her head for the last job we botched. Oh! That's why you're not coming. -Lucy, wait. -[Nadia] Annabel, what the fuck? I thought this job was gonna be different than the last. I told you nothing good would come out of that. You people are crazy. [Eddie] Luce. -[tense music playing] -Luce, slow down. Hey. Can you wait up? -Luce? What-- -What are you doing? -Please come back. -[scoffs] Come back, wow, okay. -Okay. -I... I need a minute. -Okay, let's... let's take one. -[exhales] I, uh... You... [sobs] You broke me, Eddie. -You broke me. -I know, I'm... I'm sorry. I was scared and I wasn't ready-- Okay, cut the bullshit. Look, there's... there's nothing I can say right now that's gonna make anything better, okay? When Annabel wanted to come get you, I... I didn't fight her. Okay? I didn't fight her. I... [sighs] I thought that if I saw you again... [exhales] ...I thought that I could make things right. But this... is bigger than us. -And we can't do it without you. -[Lucille sighs] -You know, I-- God, I... -[Eddie] What? -I knew I couldn't trust her. -[Eddie] Hey. You can trust me. Yeah, well, I hope you're right. [tense music fades] [sighs] Lucille. I'm sorry. So sorry. I, um... I want to apologize to all of you. I... [sighs] This job is not like any other job. Each one of you is the best at what you do. I chose you. I chose you. We're trying to right a wrong against humanity and Josef believed that and I believe that. And I'm putting my faith and trust in each of you. You're my team. I need you. I can't do this without you. [exhales] Okay. Okay, I'll stay. We're still here. Nadia? I'm in. Just... don't hide anything from us anymore, okay? Please. [exhales heavily] I mean, look, that... Killer speech. Killer speech. Now, I hate Nazis as much as the next guy, but, um... [clicks tongue] ...how much are these paintings actually worth? -They're priceless. -[Bruno] Priceless? Wow, I mean, that's... that's a pretty big payday, no? Well, you're already being compensated pretty generously. [clicks tongue] Right, but, by the sounds of it, priceless, could be a whole lot more, no? Well, that's not what this is about. Does anybody else feel like this? -Huh? -No, I'm good. -[Bruno scoffing] -Okay. Oh, so, it's just... just me. All right, never mind. We're good. [Lucille] So, the building has IP cameras all over, inside and out. Here we go. There's one right here, here. Um. Won't they catch you hacking into the system? Not this time. I've doubled the number of times I've rerouted, as well as doubled my layers. It'll take them forever to find me this time. Plus, I'm not in their network. I'm just watching the cameras. -You haven't pwned 'em again? -Funny. No. -[suspenseful music playing] -Uh. So, so far I've counted at least ten different guards. That's more than double what was at the house. [Lucille] Not only is that more, these guys are dangerous. I've done some facial recognition and most of these guys are in the system. -Ex-cons? -[Lucille] Worse. Ex-KSK, Kommando Special Kraft. German special forces. The more the merrier, if you ask me. Easy. The minute one of those guards sounds the alarm, we're screwed. Okay, so, not a standard smash-and-grab? No, it's not. Not this time. Uh-uh. So, how are we gonna get in? Here. This garage door. Serve it special delivery? Yeah. Shell game on the way out. Okay, that works. But I think we're gonna need more. What do you mean? Well, I mean, we're going by assumption here.

This is our first time, but a friend told me that these were the best martinis in L.A., so, we had to try them. Ah. I heard they do the trick. -[Angie] Yes! -[giggles] [Angie chuckles] -Who's your friend? -[Angie] Hmm. This is Francesca and I'm Angie. Ah. It's a pleasure to meet you both. [chuckles] -And you are, mister... -Oh, please. You call me Otto. Otto? That is an adorable name for such a powerful-looking man. -[Angie] Mm-hmm. -Otto, maybe you can help us settle a disagreement we're having. -Angie here... -[Huizen] Of course. ...um, doesn't think she looks good tonight. Don't you think she looks beautiful? Well. -No more so than yourself. -[Lucille chuckles] And, uh, incredibly sexy if I'm not being too forward. -Oh, thank you. -[chuckles] You should have seen me earlier. -I was a hot mess. [chuckles] -She was a mess. But Francesca here helped me get ready. That's right. I would say she's quite the artist. -Don't you think? -[Huizen] Artist? -[Angie and Lucille] Mm-hmm. -Ah. Was she your, uh, your canvas? Maybe. [giggles] Are you a-- Are you a connoisseur? I know what I like when I see it. [both] Hmm. -[Angie giggles] -Do you like what you see now? I have seen the most beautiful art the world has ever known. And you both come in a very close... second. -Oh. Second? -Oh, come on. Where have you seen art more beautiful than us? -I own it. -[Lucille] Oh. Like, you mean, like, a... a gallery? More of a privat collection here in Los Angeles. -Oh. Can we, um, can we see it? -Can we see it? [chuckles] Like I said, it's a... private collection. One only fit for an Aryan people of which you... are not. [chuckles] [dollar bills rustling] Good night, ladies. [electronic dance music playing] [electronic dance music fades] [Lucille groans] He's such a pig. Oh, he's got 'em here in L.A., all right. -What else did he say? -He wouldn't stop bragging about his private downtown collection. He wouldn't let us see it, though. He said... [chuckles] He said we weren't worthy. Yeah. That sounds like him. -[sighs] -You did good, Luce. -You did good. -[Lucille] Yeah. Thanks. [sighs] -You okay? -Yeah. You look good. [Annabel] Hey, guys. Focus. All right, Nadia, Bruno. You guys are up. [grunts] Let's do it. [Annabel] Come on, come on. -We'll work on that. -[Annabel] Let's go. [Bruno] Ah, shit. [Victoria] Nathan! [intense music playing] -[chuckles] It's Victoria. -I'm sorry? We met at my architecture firm where you lied your way in to steal some blueprints? Um, not quite sure I know what you're talking about. You think you're pretty slick? We have security cameras. I saw you go into the file room. [chuckles] Well, that's... that's quite a story. Don't worry. I didn't tell anyone. -I deleted the security footage. -Really? Why? Architecture isn't too terribly exciting. Plus, I might have a weakness for Latin men. -Is that so? -[Victoria speaks indistinctly] So, what else are you into? This thing's not gonna zap me, is it? [clicks tongue] It's not broadcasting any signals, -it's listening for one. -You know what? I bet he's got more than just paintings in there. Yeah, I bet he's got, like, gold or some shit. -Gold? -[Bruno] Mm-hmm. No one deals with gold anymore. [chuckles] No, you bet your ass a guy like Huizen? -He's got gold. -Well, you know what? Then you can come back and rob him. Right now, we're not checking for no gold. Shit. If I find gold, I'm taking it. Do you know how heavy gold worth stealing is? -You won't get too far. -Oh. Hey, hey, hey, wait. It's opening. Oh, yeah, I'm picking up the frequency. -You getting it? -[device whirring] Hang on. [Bruno] Oh, you're gonna miss it. [Nadia] I'm getting it. It's getting close, you're gonna miss it! -[device beeps] -I got it. Yeah? [chuckles] [intense music concludes] -Let's go. -Easy. [device chimes] All right, done. That'll open the garage door. Okay, I'll override the cameras looping in the street while you guys get in. What if there's guards waiting in the garage? Ah, you should leave that to me, yeah? Ah, yeah. Uh, no. No guns. -[Bruno] What? -Yeah, no guns. -Wait, wait. Are you for real? -Yeah. You... you heard what she said about those guys, right? They're not messing around, so... [clicks tongue] I said no guns. You got that? My man, we're thieves, not killers. [Annabel] Exactly. This motherfucker gonna get us killed. -Thank you. -[breathes deeply] The Syndicate does not condone guns or murder, and neither do I. [clicks tongue] That's just fine. But any friction, I'm gonna handle things my way. Yeah? -[siren wailing in distance] -[suspenseful music playing] [Eddie] All right. Everyone ready to go? Let's do a comms check. [earpiece beeps] [Eddie over comms] Annabel, you read me? Okay. I'm starting recording. Okay. Cameras are looping. You're invisible. [Lucille exhales sharply] All right, here we go. Fingers crossed. [Eddie] Jefe, why is it not working? [Bruno] Motherfucker. This is gonna be a short trip, huh? -Awesome. -[Lucille] No, no, no, no, no. [sighs] -[Eddie] There we go! -[Lucille] Hell yeah, girl! We're in. [breathes deeply] -[suspenseful music concludes] -[upbeat pop music playing] [indistinct chatter] [suspenseful music playing] [Eddie] Okay, we split up. Radio silence 'til you find the safe. Stay out of sight. You two go. Now. [toilet flushing] Holy shit. This is it. -[Bruno] Yeah? How do you know? -It has a biometric lock. What the hell does that mean? [Nadia] It means it needs a fingerprint. -Okay, well, can you open it? -[clanking in the distance] Hold up. -[indistinct radio chatter] -Keep going. [grunts] [both grunt] -[grunts] -[suspenseful music concludes] What the hell did you do that for? You were taking too long. I had him right where I wanted him! -Let me get that gun. -[gun clicks] No guns, remember? I kicked his ass, though. -[upbeat pop music playing] -[indistinct chatter] -[Otto indistinct] -Oh, my goodness. I am so sorry. It's been so long since I've worn heels and just had a little too much tonight. I really am sorry. I'm fine. Clean that. Dry it. -[guard mutters] -[suspenseful music playing] [shouts, grunts] [both grunt] Do you copy? Lucille, do you copy? Hey, two guards are approaching. -[grunts] -[groans] [both grunt] -[beeping] -[grunts] [pants] [lock beeps] Holy shit. -That's not a safe. -Nope. -[Bruno] That's a fucking vault. -[Nadia chuckles] Yeah. I knew he had more than just paintings in there. [clears throat] Can you open it? I guess, we'll have to find out, right? -[pants] Hey. Where do we go? -Hey, you good? [Annabel over comms] Eddie, head up to the eighth floor. Come on, come on. [exhales sharply] -[metal clattering] -Woah. That's not a safe. -Really? I hadn't noticed. -[exhales] Can you open it? Huh, I've always wanted to use this. Okay, well, Nadia, whatever you're gonna do, you gotta do it fast. Oh, hold up, hold up. Is that nuclear? No, no, no, no, this is a rare earth magnet, it's made out of neodymium. Once turned into an alloy with iron and boron, -it becomes magnetized. -Science lesson later, we gotta get this open right now. Okay. Just give me one second. This... -Okay. -[Eddie] Yeah. S... speed it up, Nadia, come on. [Nadia] I'm trying to find this. -[magnet beeping] -What? What? What? What? Give me more time. Uh, we gotta keep the guards away. What do you got for a diversion? Hmm, I'll improvise. -I'll go with him. -[Eddie] No, Luce, no. -No, no, I need to help him. -[Eddie] No. I'll be fine. [guards thud] You're just full of surprises, aren't you? Let's go, let's go, let's go. Shit, I forgot my stuff at school. All right. Yeah. Okay. All right. Here we come. Let's get this bad boy. -[magnet chimes] -[grunts, sighs] -Now what? -I'm looking for the solenoid. The what? When you enter a passcode, the keypad sends a signal to the solenoid. The signal then passes through a magnetic field, converting it to a mechanical movement. If the magnets hit the field, -it causes the locks to unlock. -Cool. [breathes heavily] But it'll go faster if you help me move it, okay? -Just... -Yeah, no, no, yeah, -of course. My bad. -Give me a second. [grunts] What's the word? Just... just give me one second. Guys, we don't have enough time. [Nadia] Yeah, just give me one second, please. [breathes heavily, grunts] -Come on, come on, come on. -[magnet chimes] -Whoo!

Everybody just shut the fuck up! -Annie, what the hell... -Quiet! -Quiet! -...were you thinking? We don't do that! That's not us! Okay. You're all right, you're okay. We go to the Syndicate and tell them what happened. No! You know they'll have nothing to do with this. Annabel, you said they were priceless. Sell them to the highest bidder. No, selling stolen art is the quickest way to get busted, even on the dark web. -We can't do that. -[Eddie] Then what? -[yells] Then what? -Fuck. [breathes heavily] -We destroy them. -[Eddie] No. -Yes! -No way. Not again. -[Annabel] Yes! -No. Ransom. We demand a ransom from the Nazi. No. No. Josef would have never wanted that. Josef? I'm so done giving a shit about Josef and your little cause. All right? You just shot a guard in cold blood. You did that. Now, me, I'm gonna get paid one way or another. All right? [somber music concludes] -[siren wailing] -[indistinct chatter] [computer beeps] [Eddie over intercom] Hey, Annabel. Hey, guys. He said he'd meet later today. Where are you going? [clicks tongue] So close. Uh. I got some errands to run. Is that okay with you guys? The paintings? Yeah, like, I trust any of you, especially you. Whoa, whoa. We can't just let you walk out of here with them. -I'm coming. -Yeah, I don't... I don't care. See you later. [helicopter whirring] [upbeat music playing over stereo] What the hell are we doing here? Gotta unload something real quick. I thought you quit. Uh. No, I'm just out collecting. I got something you want. Boom. What do you think? Where'd you get this? It's pretty nice, huh? [Pawnshop owner] I'm gonna ask you again. Where'd you get it? -Does it matter? -Hell, yes, it matters. It's my ass that's on the line. Okay. Look, old man, I know you know people, all right? I know you got buyers for shit like this. I do. -What the hell? -Calm down. [Bruno] That's what I'm talking about! Hmm! [sniffs] Smells so good. One ain't enough. They gonna want more. No worries, Gramps. Plenty more where that came from. Let's roll. [upbeat music concludes] Something's not right. He should be here by now. I'm gonna go find the others. Listen. Try and stay out of trouble, huh? [clicks tongue] [elevator bell dinging] [suspenseful music playing] Where is she? I'm sure she's around. [chuckles] You are either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid. I'm the one who's here, ain't I? Ah. Tell me why I don't just shoot you where you stand and take what is mine? Um. Maybe there's a gun on you right now. And, maybe if you kill me, the cops will be here before you make it out with your car. You have no idea how much those are worth, do you? I figure... [exhales] ...a million? More than enough to live a pretty damn good life. A million? Yeah. [chuckles] Is that all? What is this? That's an account number, chief. Sure you got a team of bankers on speed dial. Fine. Now, I take my paintings. [clicks tongue] Sorry about your guy. My guy? [Bruno chuckles] Yeah. I mean, you know how these things go sometimes, right? Shoot or get shot. I think we have a problem here. Yeah, and what's that? None of my guards were shot. [chuckles] Bullshit. I saw him go down. And these are not my paintings. What are you talking about? [chuckles] They... they are. I don't believe that Monet or Van Gogh bought their canvases from a hobby store. -Son of a bitch. -[paintings thud] They switched bags on me. All right, uh... To steal my paintings is one thing. But to steal my gold, that's a grave mistake. [chuckles] What are you... what are you talking about? I'm trying to bring your shit back to you. You know what they used to do to thieves in Nazi Germany? -[gunshot] -[Bruno thuds] [suspenseful music concludes] [sentimental music playing] -Miss Gomez? -Yes? The museum is immensely grateful for your donation. It has always been believed that these works were lost forever. May I ask, how did they come to be in your possession? I own them. They were given to me by the original owner, Josef Goodman. He was a Holocaust survivor. These are the original ownership papers and letters of authorship from the artists themselves. [gasps] -May I? -[Annabel] Yes. My goodness. We will, uh, of course, have to, uh, -examine these for authenticity. -Of course, of course. I know they're real and I'm sure you'll find that to be true as well. Thank you. [Annabel sighs] [Otto] Those are my paintings. I would love to see you tell that to the authorities. Keep them. -I was tired of them anyway. -Is that so? [chuckles] How did you do it? How did you allow that fool to bring me those fakes? [chuckles] [upbeat music playing] I'm not leaving without those paintings. -Just give it to him, it's fine. -[sighs] Not so hard. [Annabel] Drop it! -Drop it now. -Okay, okay. [Annabel] Hurry up. Hey! We're good, right? Yeah, we're good. Every time you walk into that vault and see four empty spaces on the wall, I want you to wonder, "How did she do it?" How did my team walk out of your vault with these four paintings? [chuckles] You think you've gotten away with something so grand here. These paintings are nothing compared to my other treasures, pieces far greater in value and significance than... than some old canvases. I'm sure. -And we're coming for all of it. -[Otto] Oh? Yeah. And we won't stop until we get every last piece and give it back to the world. [clicks tongue] I'm not so sure you'll get a chance. It's time now for me to collect the bounty from the Kerrs. [clicks tongue] Well, like I said, you know where to find me. But until you do, I have some friends who would love to speak to you. [laughs] Oh, look at this. You can't hide her forever. I've seen what you're willing to risk for some old paintings. But what is a mother willing to risk for the safety of her own child? Trust me. You don't wanna fucking know. Mr. Huizen, would you come with us, please? What is this about? [Agent Garcia] These treasures of yours. We have some questions for you regarding documentation of ownership, and whether or not you've paid taxes. Right this way. Hey, Annabel? -Yeah? -Can I ask you something? Where'd you get the fingerprints? And how'd you know we were gonna need them? Sorry, that was... that was me. Yeah, I, uh... I overheard him bragging about all his treasures, and how he keeps them well-protected with guards and biometrics and a state-of-the-art safe. Which turned out to be a vault. -[Eddie] Right. -Hmm. [clicks tongue] Son of a bitch was so arrogant he didn't know the difference between a vault and a safe. Wait a second, how did you know Bruno was gonna double cross us? We needed a wildcard. Someone to take the fall if things went bad. Yeah, and he played the role perfectly. I mean, him going there alone was the best smoke and mirrors we could have hoped for to get these paintings here safely. -Yeah. -[Annabel] Yep. Yep, yep, yep. [Nadia sighs] [soft music playing] [Annabel] Josef, we did it. [Abelman] Oh, Annabel, you've done well. Josef would be proud. The paintings you recovered are... are priceless. Our appraisers have valued them beyond the levels of our... our current assets. And with their donation to the museum, we're able to shelter our other taxable resources. Our budget for future operations is tripled. But Josef was not the only one the Nazis stole from. There are others. And like yourself, they have done everything in their power to preserve their ownership and right. So, we hope you are not considering retirement just yet. -I wouldn't think of it. -[all chuckle] -Lehayim. -[all] Lehayim. [Eddie] All right, ladies, round two... -[all] Yes! -[Eddie] ...has arrived. Whoo-hoo! [chuckles] -Oh, she ready. What? [chuckles] -What? [chuckles] I just, uh... I've been thinking, right? -I don't... I don't know. -[indistinct chatter] Like, I get that we did a good thing, right? You know, that everybody gets to see the paintings, the Nazis don't have 'em. But why did we have to donate them? Oh, come on. -We did a good deed. -[Annabel] Eddie... -That should be reward enough. -Yeah. Listen, plus it saves the Syndicate millions in taxes when you donate the paintings. That means we make more money to steal more shit. -[Lucille laughs] -Exactly. -Mm-hmm. -Which, now that you mention it, the Syndicate has another mark for us, so... [clicks tongue] ...who's up for another challenge? Huh? Huh? [chuckles] You know you're my ride or die, Annie. -[Annabel] Yes! -Ooh. -[Annabel] Yes! -It beats the hell out of spending another five to ten with the feds. -So, I'm in. -Mm-hmm. [chuckles] Nadia? -Hell, yeah. [chuckles] -Hell, yeah! -[Annabel laughs] -[speaking indistinctly] -Good. [chuckles] -[Annabel] Are we good? -You know... -Come on, come on. ...it still would have been cool to be millionaires. -[Annabel chuckles] -I'm just... ...I'm just saying, you know? [chuckles] -Cheers. -Cheers! -To the team. -["Came For It All" playing] -♪ Yeah, coming for it all ♪ -♪ Tell 'em we came for it all ♪ -♪ Tell 'em we came for it all -♪ Tell 'em we came for it all ♪ ♪ You know I came for it all All, all, all ♪ ♪ I need it all All, all, all ♪ -♪ Chains can fall ♪ -♪ Fall ♪ ♪ Whoa, whoa, whoa Yeah, we came for it all ♪ ♪ Whoa, whoa, whoa ♪ ♪ Whoa, whoa, whoa Yeah, I'm coming for it all ♪ ♪ I'm a giant Standing ten feet tall ♪ ♪ Don't you try to hide now ♪ ♪ Do you hear yourself?
