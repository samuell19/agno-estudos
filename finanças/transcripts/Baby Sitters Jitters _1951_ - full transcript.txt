Butt out of this, porcupine. Oh! [KNOCKING ON DOOR] ♪ Come in ♪ ♪ Come in ♪ ♪ Come in ♪ The landlady. So, it was you who stole my daughter's dolls. We didn't hurt them, we was just trying to-- Listen, you no-good loafers, you're way behind in your rent. And if you don't pay me, out you go. Now, take it easy, Mrs. Crump, we'll give you every dime we owe you. We're taking a course on how to be baby-sitters. MRS. CRUMP: Hm. See? "Baby-sitter." You have friends. Maybe you can recommend us to baby-sit. That's an idea. Yes. But I'll collect the money, understand? Oh, yeah. Sure. Definitely. Don't worry, we'll give you every cent. See that you do. Yeah. ALL: Ah! Ah, yourselves. Ah! [BARKS] [BOTH BARKING] Hey, bloodhounds, we gotta get back there, continue our lesson on baby-sitting. [BOTH BARKING] [BOTH SHOUTING] Come on.

Some baby. Ooh. Ooh. Well, this is rather unexpected. But come in. Watch yourself. Now, boys, I-- [GASPS] [COOING] Ah. Oh. Goodness, I must have dropped this in the crib when I ran to answer the door. But-- [ALL SHOUTING] [GIGGLES] Don't be frightened, boys, it isn't loaded yet. Oh. I keep it handy because I'm afraid a certain party might try to kidnap Junior. As a matter of fact, that's why I have the crib in this room. Well, nobody's gonna kidnap him, not with us around. Oh, that's why Mrs. Crump sent the three of you. Uh-huh. We work as a unit. Yeah, we're unitarians. [CHUCKLING] Quiet. Oh. Oh, oh. [DOORBELL RINGS] My goodness, I must hurry. I'll probably be home very late, so take good care of Junior. Bye-bye, darling. JUNIOR: Good night, Mommy. Make yourselves at home, boys. Good night. Thank you. Good night. That's a nice kid. I'll take care of Junior. Larry, you rustle up some toys. You go find the kitchen to see if there's any grub, and remember-- Look out with that pistol, will ya? It ain't loaded, see for yourself, you nitwit. What are you doing? [GUN COCKING] Ow. I'll go. I'll kick you right-- [JUNIOR CRYING] Oh. Oh, oh. What are you squawking about? I'm the guy that got it. [CRYING] Hey, Shemp, hey, Larry. What's the matter? See if you can quiet that kid, he's driving me nuts. Come here. [SPEAKING GIBBERISH] A-coochie-coochie-- [CRUNCHING] Ow. You bit me. Did you bring the instruction book with you? Yeah, here, read it. You know I can't read good. [JUNIOR CONTINUES TO CRY] Okay. Let me see. Here it is, crying babies. "If the child's crying persists, "something must be done to attract his attention. "A good way to do this is to have some adult "stand on his head--" Oh, if we could only find an adult. "This generally changes the crying infant into a laughing dolly." Okay, bud, you're elected. Eureka. You don't smell so good, either. Oh! Oh. Now, get going. Coochie-- Step aside. Watch me, kid, watch me. I'm an old circus man. Hey, kid, watch me! Hey, kid, watch me. Yoo-hoo. [LAUGHING] It worked. Help me down, I'm losing my balance. Oh! Easy, kid, we'll have you. There you are, easy there. We're proud of you. That was great work. [LAUGHING] [LOUD CLANGING] Oh, uh, I was passing by, a drawer was open, and my sleeve got caught on the-- On the drawer. Oh, I see. Pardon me. [LOUD CLATTERING] Why, you nitwit, you. I told you to find the kitchen, not steal it. Pick up that stuff. Oh, oh! Oh, oh. [LAUGHING] I fooled him that time. [LAUGHS] I fooled him again. Shempy? Yessy? Get out, you. Oh! Oh, you sap. You couldn't fool me that way. No, you're too much of an ignoramus. Yeah, and that goes for the whole family too. Yeah. See that? What? Go over there and watch the kid. Go ahead. Pick up that stuff and put it in the drawer here. Look at that. And I just happen to have a nipple with me. See? So you can have it. Now-- Now, not every kid can get this. Now, there it is. Now, take it easy. And there. Now, hold it. [SUCKLING] Hey, take it easy, you'll drown yourself. Hey, fellas? I think I got something that'll keep the little brat quiet. [JUNIOR LAUGHS] Oh. Never mind. He's got something that'll keep me quiet. [LAUGHING] Boy, that kid's vicious. Forget it, I'm hungry. So am I. When do we eat? Right now. The lady said we should make ourselves at home. Hey, I saw a package of consummated soup in the kitchen. I'll fix it. Good. Hurry up. Now that you mention it, I'm starving. Me too. Fruit. Oh, nuts. Hey. Oh. [CHUCKLES] I hate the stuff under these things. Yeah. [HUMMING] "Fee-likes fay-mouse consumate-treated soup." [CHUCKLES] That's it. Yes, sir. Oh, let's see now, um, oh, yes. "Saggie." [MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY] That's it, a little saggie. Now, um, "caninny." That should be good. A little-- What, no pits in there? Oh, that's all right. And, ah, what's this? "Moostar." That won't come out. That will go in there like that. Some, ah, gloves. [CHUCKLES] Gloves, how do you--? Oh, little gloves. And, um... Bacon pood-- Poo-- Powder. Powdered bacon. What'll they think of next? [CHUCKLES] [CRYING] Shh. Hey, chef. All right, I'm coming. What's the matter? He's crying again. Do your stuff. Okay, watch me kid. Watch me. Watch him. Get out of the kid's way. Yoo-hoo. [JUNIOR LAUGHS] SHEMP: Here I am again. It worked. Moe. Larry, get me down. I'm stuck again. Okay, here, come on. Easy now. Nice going. It worked again. [BELL RINGING] Uh, do you hear a bell ringing? Yes. That's my head from standing on it too much. [LAUGHS] [CHUCKLES] [TICKING] What's that? A clock. What does a clock say? Tick, tick, tick, tick-- Hey, come here. Oh, oh, oh. What's the matter with that soup? It should be ready by now. Larry, go get the soup. That's an order. Aye-aye, captain. Oh! You know, uh, there's a thousand reasons why I shouldn't drink. No kidding. Yep, a thousand reasons but I can't think of one right now. [CHUCKLES] Oh. [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] Say, did you ever see how they launch a ship? No, how? That's how. [GROANS] What's the matter with you? I'm seasick. LARRY: Hot soup. Come and get it. Bring it right here. Oh, boy. [JUNIOR COOS] Oh-ho. Ahh. SHEMP: Oh. [MOE SLURPING] Agh. Tastes like a dead horse. You know, if I hadn't made this myself I'd swear there was a little soap in it. [TALKING GIBBERISH] [GROANS] Oh. [GROANS] Ahh. [ALL GROANING] Oh, Moe. LARRY: What's in that soup? SHEMP: Too bad. [JUNIOR GIGGLES] Ahh... Ah, boom. Ah, boom. [MEN SNORING] [GASPS] Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Where? Who? The door was open. What happened? Where's baby? He was sleeping here with me. Maybe he's between the spring and the mattress. He's gone. Oh, this is the work of my husband. He's stolen my baby. What's his name? George Lloyd. He lives at the Folger Apartments, 212, 10th street. We'll go there. We'll have him back in no time. [SOBBING] Please, find my baby. Well, calm yourself, madam. I don't know what I'll-- There's nothing to get excited about. I know what the kid looks like. Watch me. Watch what I'm doing. Hey, lady, watch me. [LAUGHS] [ALL LAUGH] Hey, fellas, she forgot to give us the apartment number. We'll find it. Shemp, peek under that door. Larry, come on. Oh! Oh, oh, oh, my-- Oh, my eye. [YELLS] Oh, oh. Moe. Larry.

Oh, you framed me, eh? No, Moe, no. Ow! You gonna start that again? Wait a minute. Pick on somebody your size. You want me to pick on you? Yeah, I want you to pick on me. Ahh. I knew I'd-- Whoa. [GROANS] What's the matter with you? You out of your mind? Junior. Wait a minute. That's my son. You fellas can't come and take him away. He belongs to his mother and we're responsible. You're not gonna take him. Oh! [JUNIOR LAUGHS] Now, look here, mister. We were hired to guard this-- Oh-oh-oh. As far as we're concerned-- Ah! Ah! Oh! Oh! [ALL GROANING] Ah, Junior. [LAUGHING] Why-- [EXHALES] Listen, we're gonna take that kid. And nobody's gonna stop us, see? I guess you told him. You said it. You told him. Boys. Yes? Oh. Oh, a wise guy, eh? Why... That's all I'm doing with you, kid. A little too quick for you, huh? [CHUCKLES] [JUNIOR CRYING] All right-- Hold it. That's okay. Don't cry, kid. Watch me. [JUNIOR LAUGHS] You like that, eh, kid? Okay, let's go. [GRUNTS] Baby. [SIGHS] George. Darling. BOTH: Ohh. GEORGE: What fools we've been. Flypaper. Ooh. Oh, Moe, wait a minute. I didn't mean-- Let's see. Get it off. Yeah. Why... Oh!
