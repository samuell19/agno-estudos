Run, Hong Gil Dong! - You have to live. - Mom... Live and avenge me. Confused... I feel so confused. Can one die out of confusion? Scumbags. Hi! Hi! Kidnapping girls who're not even 20 years old. Rape, human trafficking, even murder. Criminals who persistently live and survive. Some time ago, their whole organization was shut down by Hwallbindang. Kidnapped children were returned to their parents. They were deceived, so of course they want revenge. Today, I'll give them a taste of revenge. Those gang leaders. - He's here. - Already? Now, in there... is Hong Gil Dong, the man you're looking for. Coincidentally, I have questions that I want to ask all of you. Damn it! Aigoo, too noisy! Why do you guys keep looking for me? So annoying. Hey, why are you sitting over there? Jang Ji Seong's brother Jang Dae Seong... Yeonnam-dong, Apartment Sinseong 102-dong, #403. - What's all this? - Yang Jin Tae's mom, Oh Yeong Ja... Today, she went to the hospital from gastric pains. Jeong Ho Il's wife, Kim Gyeong Soo... It's 2 days since she went to her parents' house. If you disturb me in the next 20 seconds... your family members will die. Now, put your guns on the table. Today, you won't be able to contact them. - Shut up! What are you talking about? =I'll kill Jang Dae Seong first.= Enough! You heard that, didn't you? It true! That's Daesung's voice. Put your guns on the table! If you do that, I'll let you hear their voices I--I... My mother is seriously ill. Ji Seong Hyeong! Wh--What? What should we do? You said you were gonna let us hear their voices! You son of a bitch! Why did you involve my innocent GyeongSoo? Don't believe my words too much. Because they're all lies. Seriously! So noisy! Have you ever heard of Kim Byeong Deok? Kim Byeong Deok... Ever heard of him or met him? If the name comes out from one of your mouths, or one of you gives me useful information, I'll let that person go. Me--Me... I know Kim Byeong Deok. - Where is he? - Eh? A--Ah... In Yeonsin. I'm an expert in deceiving. Membership requirement no. 2 is to detect lies. Why are you speaking nonsense? How annoying. Now, start cutting off your fingers! Starting from Jeong Ho Il! You two can help him. Plea-- 'Please spare me.' Aren't those the words you always hear? Cut off Jeong Ho Il's finger! Don't make me ask you again, just keep him quiet and cut! If you keep dilly dallying or talk, I'll blow your heads off. This is your punishment for daring to go up against Hong Gil Dong. Name, Kim Byeong Deok. They said he was blind. Seems like they were right. - The address is Gangwon-do, Hwacheongundo, Gimyeon Myeong-wolri 94-3. - Myeong-wolri 94-3...I know. President Hwang... I'll be back before dawn. Tomorrow. After I kill Kim Byeong Deok. - Those who should be killed, must be killed. If needed, tortured. - Enough. - Understand? Don't make innocent people suffer. My name is Hong Gil Dong. Illegal detective agency, Hwal Bin Dang Private Detective. Even though my job is to face enemies and all that other dangerous crap, my income is still decent. Besides, it's easy. Nobody knows me. Even I myself dont know who I really am. I only remember my name. Anyway, I'm going to meet someone very special today. Me, who always manage to find the people that I look for within a day, have wasted more than 20 years to look for this person. -=Detective Hong Gil Dong: Missing Village=- I only recently remebered that name. From my lost memories, I only remember him. The left eye blind man, Kim Byeong Deok. Wait for me! Soon... Soon... -=Myeong Wol Ri=- What now? - Why is my rice portion so big? - That's my rice! - Yours? - I want to eat a lot. - Alright. I made this Gosari. Taste it. [Gosari - A fern like vegetable.] No! No! I want to eat something else. Tomorrow I'll fry eggs for you. Eat a bit. Good kid. Aigoo, my darling eat deliciously. Dong Yi, are you still picking up bottles and selling it? Why don't you listen to me? You're just like a beggar. You used to do it too! How is that being a beggar? Just because I did it, must you do it too? But if I can get a bit more money, I can buy you eye-glasses, Grandfather. Dong Yi, you need to study hard. What's the use of glasses? If you do this again, I'll go to your school and report it to them. Promise me! Don't do it again, alright? We need to pack up tomorrow. After school, come straight home. - Mal Soon, you too. Don't play at school. - I dont want to move anymore. If we move...we can go eat tangsuyuk together. [Tangsuyuk - Sweet sour pork] Aigoo, what happened to you? Are you that hungry? Eat slowly. Stay still. Let me wipe it. Grandfather...There's someone outside. Dong Yi, Mal Soon... I need to go outside for a moment. There's something I need to do. Only for a little moment! Dont worry and wait for me. I'll come back in a minute. Where are you going to at this time of night? I'll be gone just for a second! Don't go to the police. Never report to the police. Even if the police come here and ask questions, don't tell them anything. Hurry up! Hide in the back! Grandfather, what is it? Listen to me. Take Mal Soon with you. Hurry up! Faster! Old man, come with us. Whatever he wants, tell him to come here! Get out of here, unless there was anything else! Aigoo, I'm already tired. Erm, old man... Come with us. Why did you push me? We intend to bring you with us peacefully. Sis... Grandfather! Grandfather! Hey, is this the right direction? What is that? Damn it. Don't get out of the car! The road is so narrow. What's he doing? Looks like he's not gonna move... Looks like his car broke down. What is this? Why are you awake? -=Registration no:=- Gangwon 5, 7102 Gangwon 5, 7102. 94-3; Kim Byeong Deok.

[Yeonggam - old man] Why now? Who are you? My enemy's grandchildren. This is so disgusting! Who are you, mister? He looks like a policeman. Why is a policeman here? We didn't report anything. Grandfather said not to report to the police. Sis, looks like this mister is a bad guy! A bit late to introduce myself. I am a government employee from Chuncheon who's responsible for civil registrations. Registration Department? Dong Jin Elementry School, class 5-12, Kim Dong Yi. Class 1-8, No. 33 Kim Mal Soon Grandfather's full name is Kim Byeong Deok. Trash picker until he got arthritis. Suffers from diabetes. And you guys are going to move from here, right? How do you know that? This house... the down payment is 100 000 won. and the monthly rent is 20 000. But this village is included in the area that's going to be developed. Land registration requires, due to the implementation of Compensation Law Clause 54, to leave the land in October, at the latest. And that's why I'm here today to meet your grandfather. I know your grandfather very well. Dong Yi, you got 100 in 3 tests. He's so proud of you. Now you get it, right? My reading and listening test also got a 100 mark. What's up with this kid? Anyway, there's a chance I can help you find your Grandfather. Help us find Grandfather? I can find him in 1 hour. But both of you need to come with me. Grandfather told us to stay here. Then, I'll come back later. Didn't you say you want to help us find Grandfather? You'd never understand even in your wildest dreams why I need the both of you. If the direction just now was correct... One of these three... The Yongdam housing area in the middle of the city. Or the small remote mountain area where there is... ... an abandoned factory. Straw. Gunshot. -= Choi Tae Jeong =- Choi Tae Jeong. Looks like he's calling someone. - Look up registration number "Gangwon 5-7102" - Why are you looking for...? Head of Hwallbindang, President Hwang Gye Sook, Heiress of the corporation. Has a large scale charity organization. 20 years ago her father took me in, an orphan. We grew up together. For justice, she followed her late father's will. Organized a detective agency. And gave me the number 1 position. Truthfully, I dont like to depend too much on others. -= Yellow pages. =- =They are able to spread terror through wars.= =Gwangeunhwe will resort to anything in order to gain money and power= =Your words are too much.= -=Park Seon Gil - Congress Peace Party=- =You're too passionate when talking about such a baseless theory. What does it even mean?= Grandad! =There is no Gwangeunhwe.= Grandma! =There's no proof.= Grandma! Hmm? What? So annoying. How much is it? Wait a minute. Milk and sugar, how much is it? It's 200 Won but because you're handsome, - You can pay just 100 Won. - Keep the change. Does anyone around here keep cows? The footsteps, straws from a barn. Using slippers in this weather. He shouldn't have gone too far. Kidnapping? So what? Do you have proof? Proof! Where did you park the car? The car key is on you right now, isn't it? So what? You seem to know something. Does the Chief know that you're here? So the police is involved... Don't talk nonsense. I didn't do anything. I didn't accuse you. Tonight, at 7:08pm, You, Kim Jinho and your friend Choi Dae Jeon, Drove a car with registration no. "Gangwon 5-7102" and kidnapped Kim Byeong Deok. Then, you handed him over to the man you call Chief and received money in return. After that you went for a drink, but due to the cold weather and being tired, you drove home. Jin Ho, did you forgot me? I'm the one who was blocking the road, changing my tires. Don't you know why I was there, in the middle of the night? I was monitoring you of course. The Chief is someone we've been tracking from beginning. If you talk nonsense one more time, I won't be asking politely anymore. Think before you answer me! Who do you think you're lying to? M--Me... I was just responsible for driving the car. The Chief will call you now. When you answer the call, a few seconds later, the connection will be cut-off. You just have to tell me where the car is. =Where is the car?= The place where we met yesterday. =Come and give me the key!= Where is the place? That... That place... When you walk out of here, walk back-- Mr Registration! Found him. Did you find Grandfather? What are you doing? Ah, this man must be from the registration department too. I'm Kim Mal soon, my grandfather... What is this? Are you really a cop? Yeah, I figured. Who are you? First, tell me where that place is! Get out! Get out of here if you want to stay alive! Still dont wan't to get out? Mister, why are you lying? He said that you're a cop. - Sis, this man is weird. -Mal Soon... Why did you bring this? What if someone steals it? This is Grandfather's most precious possession. I nearly had the answer. But because of these two... Better just tie them up and throw them in the car trunk. This is the only thing left. Can't lose it too. Can't we come with you? Lets go together. Damn these reckless kids. We'll talk about this later. The police isn't investigating this, they're the kidnappers. Not killing, but kidnapping secretly. There's no personal grudge so this isn't about revenge Cannot be sold, and cannot generate money. Kidnapping an old man like this is not for money. Maybe it's because this old man knows or has something. Someone came looking. For what? I don't now. Asking this and that. But I forcefully sent him away. Mister! Mister! Mister! Mister! What's that sound? Did you walk here? Yes, why? Ah, damn it! Where are you, Mister? He got away from me just like that. Kim Byeong Deok, I'll catch you. With my own hands... Oh the milk candy! Did I drop it when I was running? Why is nothing going smoothly? I've got no money. Mister, where are we going? Is Grandfather ok? Hey! Yes? Too noisy! Wait a minute! Is that money? What is this feeling? Welcome! Welcome! It needs to have a phone. The largest room. Didn't I say that there's a sonnim coming. [Sonnim - customer] No wonder the magpies keep chirping. That'll be 8 500 Won. =A shabby second-hand furniture shop. Opened just a few days ago.= - Because we're newly opened, I'll give you a 1000 Won discount. =Tattoo was removed; wants to forget his old life as a gang member...= - 7... 7 thousand. =... he's a bit stupid.= The balance is 1000, right? Aigoo, you're so cute. You're as cute as a small pet. Hold on. I actually bought this to stop smoking, but I'll give it to you instead. Your daughter... nieces, right? No. This mister said that my Grandfather was kidnapped by the bad guy... Say thank you to the uncle. Good girl. What is he talking about? I'm a public prosecutor (- Geumsa). These days my assignment is to protect the victim's family. I don't think I should be doing something like this but there was pity involved. And I'm the new kid, so I had to follow orders. Anyway, just pretend that you don't know anything. Oh, Geumsa. Kids, lets go upstairs! Grandfather's kidnapped. You're a geumsa? Forget Wolgil-ri, Gudam-ri. He didn't even blink when he lied. What is his actual job? Mister, you haven't slept since yesterday. You should sleep first. Hello, may I speak to Tae Jeong? =Tae Jeong? Who?= Hello, may I speak to Tae Jeong? =Choi Tae Jeong? There's nobody by that name.= Ah, it's you? You... Erm, is the prosecutor in there? There's something I'd like to talk to you about. - I'm a bit busy right now. - Sorry for disturbing you but... ...I'm a bit impatient. Before, I used to be involved in the world of fighting. But now of course, I'm back on the right track. Now, I'd never, ever...But my inn is newly opened... Honestly... Those scumbags surely need to die. - Sis, I also brought a notebook! - Good.. - I want to write, just like you do. - However, there's a building nearby. Anyone who saw it would feel weird. - However, there's a building nearby. Anyone who saw it would feel weird. - Sis, I wrote it down. - A lot of people went inside. A lot. A whole lot of people. - Sis, like this? Right? - What are you trying to say? - Oh, erm... what do I want to say? Oh yeah, I was moving a few chairs inside. And then, I saw something strange inside.. - Hello? Is Tae Jeong working today? =- Tae Jeong? He's not here today. Who is this?= Of course he's not there. - We'll talk again next time. - Ok... Where are you going? Just wait here patiently. I will NOT wait here patiently! Erm, if you really want to protect them you should bring them along. Lubricant stain on the gloves. Oily nails. It's obvious, he was working here until yesterday. =Taegwang Workshop= The long haired Choi Tae Jeong. You scared me! - Oh yeah, yesterday I fell and hurt my knee. - Ey... Don't go on your own. You two, come here! What's up? Hey, do you want to find your Grandfather or not? Of course we do! It'll be difficult to find him if you continue behaving like this. If you're not going to help, dont be an obstacle. - You lie all the time. - That is how to do it! If you don't understand, can't you just shut up? If you want to live longer, be careful of what you say! That gave me goosebumps. 7:15 pm. Still here? =This is the first time since the 80's that an election will be held.= =The candidates are trying to gain more votes.= What do you want? Noone's working today. Nowadays you can count on one hand the amount of youngsters that can take a beating. Pessimists are the ones I hate the most. Ah, this shop should close earlier. I've had enough of this place. Yet I can't live without it. The 24th. Who would be coming on the 24th? The governor. He said there are important issues he wants to talk about. All Myeong-wolli residents were asked to attend. Things are already depressing enough. What's he going to blab about? And why does it have to be at night? But you're not from around here, are you? How'd you know about the governor? Heard it somewhere. Forgot where. That car outside, no. 7102, when did it get here? Someone sent it here around 10 minutes ago. Why are you asking? 10 minutes ago, at 07:05pm? Could I see the invoice? I'm from the Claims Department at the insurance company. Actually, he is... He is a detective, from class super. Class super? What's that? A regular detective, but of higher class. Just shut up! Why? Didn't you tell me to act like this? I'm trying to help you. Aigoo, so cute. Actually, I'm a police officer. Can you give me the contact info for the owner of 7102? - On what business does the police... - Our Grandfather was kidnapped by the bad guys. - Mister police officer is helping us find him. - You can't say it like that. He told us not to do that. Ohh, right. - Their grandfather was kidnapped? - Yes. - Their grandfather? - Yes. - So the car owner is the criminal? Yes, so hurry up and give me the contact info. Quickly! Mister, how'd you find the criminal so fast? You're awesome. Right, Mal Soon? Yeah you're awesome. But there's always something fishy. Do you think I'm a good guy? Yes! Your guess is wrong. Completely. For the last time... If you try to butt in again, then I'll-- Are you really a Registration Department employee? It-- It's true. It really is true. Please don't go around talking nonsense. But maybe all these people can help us later. Impossible, so shut your mouth! Here... You keep looking at these. Do you want some? Aigoo seriously! Wait here! What's in the bag? Nothing. You can't communicate with those kids. I should let them know the taste of fear. Where's Kim Byeong Deok? Hwacheon police division, Force team 1, Det. Kang Seong Il. Even though I don't know what you guys are up to, just give me Kim Byeong Deok and I'll generously pretend that I know nothing about this. On a normal day, I would teach you guys a lesson But due to some personal issues I need to attend... Why are there so many papers here? Why are you looking for Kim Byeong Deok? What are you saying, you idiot. That's none of your business. You... Are you Hong Gil Dong? Looking for Kim Byeong Deok to get even? - Who're you? - News is that you can't remember the past. But you didn't forget the old man's face. Exactly, how can one forget THAT incident? - What are you trying to do? - Don't move! If you wanna shoot, aim it at me. Try to guess where I know you from. If you make it out of here alive, ask yourself... "Who is that old man?" "Who am you really?" Who are you? Run, Hong Gil Dong! You have to stay alive. Live and avenge me. Mister, put this plaster on the wound! Apply this first. What pill is he taking? Mister... He recognized me with just one glance. He knew me. Did you ask the bad guy about my grandfather? The reason why I'm here. How does that bastard know everything? Search all the hotels! The kids are with him. - Bring them here! - Yes. Old man, Hong Gil Dong is coming. Someone whose shadow you can't even see, yet now... The Old man whose life is now meaningless... So why now? You trying to ruin my plan? Ah, Dong Yi dan, Mal Soon... Children... The children aren't important now. Aren't you here because of your obsession? Why do you still hide that fact ? It makes me sad. Humans are so carefree, that's why they do bad things. Like you did. After this problem is settled, a new world will be born. It will be just like I want it. Where's the financial report? If you let me go with the children, I'll give it to you! Kang Seong Il's document. Hwacheon police division, personal housing. October 21, from 09:00. If it's the 21st, then it began yesterday. 25 Browning automatic guns. 3 homemade bombs. 24 Soviet PPS-43 submachine guns . -=Scheduled on 22 Oct, 1900 hours.=- 24 Soviet PPS-43 submachine guns. -=Position: Head Inspector Kim Dong Sik of Hwacheon Division=- -=Formal leave: 22 Oct - 26 Oct.=- Head Inspector is on leave.

Finish: October 24, 23:00.=- =Starting from Wolgil-ri, with 2 hours intervals communication will be interrupted one by one.= Starts at 1500 hours, 23rd October. In and out route to Myeongwol-ri closed on October 24, 13:00 hours. On the 24th at 9pm, upon completion in the village of emptying the field, weapons need to be placed at the location. What does it all mean? If it's the 24th, then it will happen 3 days later. So this is it. These idiots are interesting. Kim Byeong Deok...Kang Seong Il. What's going on between them? Either way, I need to find the old man first. A man in a brown jacket with two little girls. His face has a scar. Did he stay here? Is there a bigger table? It's not practical if it's too small I'll buy a bigger one. I bought some biscuits for your children. Later, some men will come here claiming that they are police officers. One of them has shiny hair and wears glassess. He's the kidnapper. K-k-kidnapper? Police? H isn't a good policeman of course. He will ask about me, whether I was here or not. He was here yesterday. Tell him that I was here. And I'll be back tonight. A--Alright. Last night he was here... I don't know whether he'll be back. He should be... I'm out of money. Send me some! Ahh, it's gonna be difficult. Nobody can go there. Everyone's out doing research. And I need to go to the airport soon. Furthermore, I can't send it to some random place. I only have 10 Won! You should've told me that earlier. How could I have known that before? I'm too busy. The car with registration no 7102... The owner's Kang Seong Il. I know. So now you want me to give double the money for the bribe... it's not as easy as it seems to get the contract done. I don't have time to re-do it. You think we're a family of masters? What about the movie? - Didn't you say you going away for a day? Why aren't you home yet? - Whatever! Just send the money over if there's someone available. Nothing's helping! Damn it! You can still eat it if you wash it. Now, how can we find Grandfather? With this face, how... Mister, I realized something. Those bad guys probably locked up Grandfather in an abandonded building, right? In Yongdam-ri over there, there's lots of abandoned buildings. The owners rarely visit. We could go there. No need to look. I know where he is. You know? You know it? Seriously? Anyway it's not in Yongdam-ri, but in a building without an owner. - How does he know? So awesome. - Yeah, so cool. However, we need to stop somewhere else first before going there. Dong Yi, Mal Soon. Can you help me with something? Yes, we'll do it! How can we help you? You just need to say a few words. Exactly like I'll teach you. Don't say anything unnecessary. Isn't that useless to say though? That day, Kang Seong Il departed at 06:17am. At the same time, Kim Byeong Deok arrived at the workshop. Needed time: 50 minutes. 70 km/hour speed. 20 minutes journey... The distance from Dong Yi's house: 9 km. Distance from the workshop: 3 km... Kim Byeong Deok is here. Are there any vacant houses around this area? It's near the workshop. Around this area, there's a vacant building. Excuse me... but who're you? You just told me, but I still don't understand. Your face... He is from the District Government Office, Department of Planning and Land Construction, Assistang Manager Jeong Myeong Soo. Right now we're...aahh... doing a survey about land population. This month, all employees of the District Government Office is doing it. But I'm going to start first grade this year. So I just tagged along. Now you know who he is, right? Looks like you know who I am now. Here you go, drink up! Thank you! How old are you? 8 years old. Already 8 years old? And what grade are you in? Grade 5. Are your studies going well? My grade isn't good, but big sis is very smart. It's okay if you have bad grades. As long as there's something you wanna do. I had bad grades too when I was in grade school. Really bad grades? -=Writing Example=- -=Donor: Hong Gil Dong=- -=Granted by: Kang Tae Gong=- That building has no owner. This is the schematic diagram. Above that, we don't know who built it or when it was built. I only went there once. I'm not sure if it was built for people to live there. It's suspicious. We don't even know who owns the land. Lots of problems. It's weird. Thank you. Ah, yes. What is she writing? Mister... What's your real job? What is your name, mister? Kim Mal Soon, if you're still-- I said, what is your name? Mister. Park Doo Chil. You're lying, right? Sis, you think so too, right? What's up with Park Doo Chil? Be honest! Wait a minute! Is this the right road? Why are you avoiding my question? Who are you?! Didn't I say it's Park Doo Cha. But you just said Park Doo Chil? Why isn't it the same? You both seriously... Is this what your grandfather taught you? To be difficult with adults. Mal Soon, Mister wouldn't lie to us. Is your name really Park Doo Cha? It really is. Sorry for suspecting you. Mister, the place that we're going to... ...is Grandfather going to be there? Grandfather! Grandfather! Grandfather! Kim Byeong Deok is here. This time, I'll catch him. Grandfather! There's nothing here. It shouldn't be like this. Dong Yi... Mal Soon... Weird, why is this so difficult? Grandfather... is he sleeping in a warm place? He's eating good food, getting good sleep. He's fine. So don't ask those kind of questions anymore. Why? Is it hard to believe? No. I believe it. Big sis, I miss Grandfather. You're being noisy! Just eat up your jjajangmyeon! You're eating a lot. Delicious? Just eat this. Don't you have other relatives except your grandfather? An aunt, or something like that. Nope. Only me, Sis and grandfather. There's nobody else. But Sis is so smart, that she has a lot of friends. Mister, you have no friends, right? - So what? - Just my instinct. Mal Soon... Sis said that you're a private person. Do you mind if we become your friends? No! Then starting now, ... we're friends! Hey! Why are you touching me like that? Hey? Why? Hey! Hey! Stop it! Sis, is this on the house? Mister, you can have it first. Lets eat together. Friends should share. Mal Soon, come here! - Is there something on my face? -Why so messy? A man like him, it's impossible for him to have friends. It's difficult for him to like other people. Because in his heart, there's a bruise. We found them all. Should we catch them? Of course. Why are you still asking? Catch them all! Okay, and this is the info about Gwangeunhwe organization. Years ago, he witnessed his mother's death. Since then, he became a bit abnormal. I don't know if it's related to that or if there's something else. There's a problem with his brain. It cannot process fear. In short, He's fearless. Once inside, just shot. Because of nightmares, he never sleeps well. He consumes pills, like you drink water. What's this? There's nobody here? Hold on! Let me think. There's no use to think. What's so funny? Isn't Kang Seong Il coming? Date estimation: 22nd at 1900 hours. How busy is he? This is making me upset. Seems like they failed to catch him. He might have known about our arrival. Nevermind. He'll come here for sure. Long time no see. 25 Browning automatic guns, 3 homemade bombs. 24 Soviet PPS-43 submachine guns. You can check first. Those scumbags wouldn't talk till the end. Such loyalty, not even thinking about their own life and safety... What made them so devoted? If it's really impossible, I'll pay the compensation later. Why are you like this? Oh yeah, she's the owner of this bookstore. Someone I know. He's a public prosecutor. Please treat him well. Oh yes, the attic... =We will always be on the people's side.= =In this moment, our nation is on the edge of disaster.= =When the enemy is brave enough to provoke,= =whenever and in whatever situation,= =I will defend and protect this society in whatever way I can.= =If the nation believe in me, I will win!= =I will put the nation's interests above everything else.= I'm going to sleep. If you're already awake, just get up. Why didn't you buy more plasters? How many do we have left? We still have a lot. Is that your savings? I saved it for Grandfather's glassess. It's okay. I'll start saving again. I gave this inn's phone number to that man at the wokshop. Aigoo, can you tie-up her hair? So messy. How are we gonna move around together? Her hair band... Grandfather has it. Mal Soon's hair... Grandfather used to tie-up her hair... Mister, I won't cry. I'm the bigger one. I cannot cry. Grandfather said so. Mal Soon and I... ...for us, the only important person in this world is Grandfather. He's health declines. His eye condition has worsened. Everytime he's sick, people bash him. But whenever he saw that we two would have something to eat he said he wasn't suffering. Can we go back home one more time? Grandfather told us to wait at home and that he'll return. - Maybe, he's home... - Don't talk rubbish! That s-o-b... Why didn't I realize this? Dong Yi, if they failed to find it, it means it's not there. Kim Byeong Deok had a secret ledger. Owned by Gwangeunhwe. Founded a long time ago as a religious organization, now it's a strong political organization. Corrupted to the core. A group that thirsts for power. Nobody knows how much money has gone to the Gwangeunhwe. People who investigate it have either gone missing or died in accidents Gwangeunhwe is trying to gain more power in the upcoming election. They need to avoid scandals and get more funds. The terror of war that these bastards spread is now influencing the people. If their terror scare comes true, or if a big incident happen the nation will fall under Gwangeunhwe's power. The person that really wants this to happen is Kang Seong Il. If I can't prove the existence of Gwangeunhwe... What is that? ...if I could only find documents related to them... then all the bastards involved.. - I asked you to send some money. You... You still want to talk about that nonsense? =Tomorrow is the 24th.= All our members are pursuing this case. Okay, Hong Seojang. [Seojang - Police Inspector] I have some questions for you first. Kim Byeong Deok's grandchildren, why did you take them? Are you crazy? Didn't I said not to... Dong Yi, Mal Soon... and the people of Myeongwol-ri... The innocent people who are victims of a big lie... One day, an enemy will aim his gun and shot them all. Those with sharp eyes will save themselves. All comunication will be cut-off October 24th, at 2100 hours... all residents of Myeongwol-ri will be destroyed. Kang Seong Il and Gwangeunhwe will be ready to strike, also, my mother's murderer, Kim Byeong Deok... Every one of them, including me, have the same mark. Kim Byeong Deok knows everything. I need to find that old man first. What should we do now? Why are you asking me? You promised to find our grandfather, didn't you? Are you angry with me? Mister, we have a better idea. We draw grandfather's face, and put it up everywhere. How did you come up with that? I wish I could use my brain too. Lets think! Kim Dong Yi, you have good grades, right? You think your grandfather lost his way on the streets? He's been captured and locked away. In a place so remotely-- Wait a minute! Dong Yi, let me see your notes. Here. -=Used to be involved with the mafia=- -=To stop smoking, eat milk candy.=- -=Due to hasty opening, uses only second hand furniture.=- -=If polished, furniture will look like new again.=- -=A village full of second hand furniture.=- Seriously, this idiot! - Hello, this is Sangmun bookshop. - Is Yeong Hwan there? Ah,the public prosecutor. Yeong Hwan Oppa is here. But just now, there was a phone call. From Taegang Workshop, if I'm not mistaken. And it's urgent. Workshop? He said someone came. Forget that. First, let me talk to YeongHwan. He wants to talk to you. Yes, this is me. What did you see back then? Eh? When you went to get the furniture. What did you see? You... did you see an old man there? Yes... Hey, I think that was the old man! It wasn't clear, but I thought there was someone there. Anybody home? That time, I was telling you about it. But you were busy on the phone... Did you know that I went there yesterday? It's true, isn't it? I had a feeling.. Yes, yes. It's true. I saw the old man. I saw him twice. Where is that place? Where? How can I explain it? Ah, yes... after you leave the city. Hello? What is this? Hello? 1500 hours, starting from Wolgil-ri, every 2 hours... regional communication will be cut-off. Why is the workshop looking for me? A place with the shortest distance from the old man... Are you okay? On the way there, stop at the workshop first. Have problems with the car. He escaped? Why is it so difficult to contact you? Couldn't even find you at the police station. Are you working or not? Did you found it? The old man's left eye is blind, right? He was here. The kids' grandfather. He came? Here? Was busy looking for the kids. Said he wanted to go home. Don't know where he came from. His condition is so... So I asked him to rest here for awhile. Don't tell anyone about this. Hello! How can I say this? Erm... Kang Seong Il! My gun! Everything is doomed if I get caught now. Just chit-chat with him and ask him to leave. Don't get caught. You came? It's done? It's outside. You can take it and leave. Just.......leave? Oh, 15 000. I gave you a 5000 discount, so it'll be 11 000 only. Kim Mal Soon, you know where is the car, right? Open the bag and there's a gun. Take the gun and hurry come back here. Aigoo, my foot... Mal Soon. Right! Right! Why, why'd you close the door? It seems like someone's inside. Wh--Who? Why are--? You... that... Didn't I tell you to do your homework first? This useless kid. Don't let me catch you. Subtitles by: ~ Damn!SuperSub Indonesia Corrected by: romelrc~ I did well, didn't I? Why come here? Damn it. Nearly gave me a heart attack. Thank you. Mister, for Mal Soon and I... Grandfather is the most important person in the whole world. Hong Gil Dong, you need to survive. Stay alive and avenge me. I have a request. I'll pay you back later. Please send them to the bookshop. Alright.. I didn't do it for the money. But because these kids are young and so pitiful. Dong Yi, Mal Soon, both of you trust me, right? Yes! We trust you, Mister. Dont' ask anything. Follow that mister. I'll be back later. Who are you? "Gold"(Kim) "Edge" (Byeong) "Charity" (deok). Your name is Kim Byeong Deok, right? The first Gwangeunhwe journal is in your hand. The secret journal with all of Gwangeunhwe's evil deeds that cannot be exposed to the public. Tomorrow, the 24th at 9pm... those bastards will gather all Myeongwol-ri's residents and killed them all. You know about this and are using it as a shield. And you intended to leave this place. But that's not possible in the current situation. Do you feel helpless? I'm here to help you. Mister, is it true that our grandfather-- Dong Yi, hold on. That's the man from earlier, right? Tomorrow night is coming soon. There's no more time left. Tell me! My grandchildren.. I'll make sure you'll meet them. If you want me to help you, you have to tell me everything. Getting out of here without a plan... we'll get caught in no time. That incident... what you heard, saw, everything you know... Not even one word of lie. Tell me now. I... started off there. There, everyone under their power live together. Gwangeunhwe leader... For him, everyone would do anything. Once you're in, you didn't dare leave. Those bastards don't even have mercy for 6 years olds. They'd break the childrens' legs. They seized people's hard earned money. Pushed them into debts. All those with power took bribes. They pretended not to see what was really happening. I know how to do bookkeeping and some math. So I liked to keep an accounting journal. With my hand, every data was written in the journal. Listen to me. They're planninng to kill again. They still exist. In this world, there's nothing impossible for them. Wait! So the one you killed... Have you killed anyone? I escaped once. Gwangeunhwe's leader, Hong Sang Ji... He likes to rape women. He didn't care whether it was an adult or a kid. I was afraid that my daughter would be one of his victims. I was scared. I needed to run away. A lady who was with me at that time was also running away. To protect her son. But we were captured. They gave the order. One of us needed to die. That's why I picked up the gun. So you regret killing that lady... That's why you intended to ask for forgiveness, right? No. Even if I had to do it again, I would still do the same thing. If I didn't do it, my daughter would be killed. For the sake of my daugther, be it 10 or even 20 people, I'll kill them all! What? You want me to apologize? You wonder if I regret it? I don't need-- Except for my daugther, I don't need anything else. Say it again. Say that you regret it. Who are you? Was that you? The son? Even if you lie,it's okay. Say that you regret it. Dong Yi, Mal Soon... Where's the owner? What are you guys doing here? Is the old man here? Old man! Grandfather! Grandfather! Mal Soon! Old man, are you ok? Old man! We're here! Dong Yi! Mal Soon! Dong Yi! Mal Soon! Mister! You wait for me! I'll get inside. Hello? Geumsa-nim, oh it's you. Thank god. I found him! The old man! Where are you? What happened? The kids are also captured. The kids? The kids. Dong Yi and Mal Soon. You have to hurry up and come here. I'm not really sure about the address. Infront of my house, there's the main road, right? Pass it on the right and you'll see a cottage. But the place is a bit... How do you feel after meeting him? Did the old man apologize to you? Did you give it a proper thought? Where's the old man... and who you really are... What is this place? I'll be waiting for you. Sajang-nim? Oppa? Hello? What did he say? Don't move! Mom! Finally you're here, Hong Gil Dong. Where is the ledger? Ledger? I don't know anything about a ledger. You can stop it now. Do you remember? I was bitten by a dog once. You're the one who chased that away dog using a pebble. We were still young children back then. Don't worry. I'm not planning to hurt you. Oh really? I dont want to fight either. Is that true? Can I trust you? Just trust me. If I let you go now, Can you bring it here? I'd have brought it here from the start. But first, can you give the old man and the kids to me? Of course. Like you wanted to, you can take Kim Byeong Deok's corpse out of here. If you do that, I think I can trust you and let all of you go. Didn't you try to find Kim Byeong Deok because you wanted kill him? Like your mother was killed? Just like what you witnessed. What do you want now? Kim Byeong Deok and the kids are over there. Do it here. There're bullets in the pistol. Why? Isn't this familiar to you? Kill that old man and join us. The world will change. I'm the only person that can understand you. We'll be on your side. I'm sorry. Grandfather! I'll give it to you. But the ledger is not with me. You searched me, didn't you? Let me use the phone. They'll bring it here. Why are you being like this? - Didn't I said don't be like this? - Dong Yi. Didn't you sense anything strange all this time? Why I was with you guys? Why I was looking for your grandfather? An employee of National Registration Dept, why would I be looking for him? Does that make any sense? Why are you so stupid and follow me around? I'll tell you the truth. Shut up, old man! The reason I was looking for your grandfather, was to kill him. To kill him in front of you and your sister. A long time ago, your grandfather did the same to me. Answer me, Kim Dong Yi and Kim Mal Soon. What would you have done? When I woke up from my nightmares and was met by your face, do you know how much I suffered from holding in my anger? Friends? Don't make me laugh! You're my enemy's blood! Kim Byeong Deok will die by my hands. However, he will not die like this. Give me some change to make a call. They will bring the ledger here. What I said is not important. They don't believe what I said is important. I need to trust myself first. Make a call, then someone will bring the ledger here... On second thought, the phone can't connect now. Grandfather! Save yourself first! I'll get Dong Yi and Mal Soon out of here. Go! Don't let me ever see you again. Dong Yi! Forget what I just said. They were all lies. Kim Dong Yi, don't you know me? My words are all lies. Get Mal Soon and follow me! Grandfather is waiting for you outside. For the last time, trust me. Dong Yi... Mal Soon... Wait for me here. Damn this old man. I told him to get out. What is he still doing in here? Mal Soon... Grandfather! Grandfather! Dong Yi! Don't! You bastard! You disappoint me. Grandfather! Mal Soon... Mal Soon! Mal Soon! Kim Mal Soon! Mal Soon! Kim Mal Soon! Kim Mal Soon! Mister, my name is Kim Mal Soon. I'm sorry. You're not sleeping well and you're hurt. You want to help us find grandfather. I didn't cooperate with you. I wish you were our uncle. But being friends is great too. Yours, Kim Mal Soon. Old man... What is Kim Mal Soon doing right now? Dong Yi... Grandfather... Have you eaten? I have. Where's Mal Soon? Mal Soon's tired so she's sleeping. Dong Yi, from now on you need to look after Mal Soon. Child, I can't take care of you anymore. Dong Yi, Mal Soon... because of me the both of you suffered. Forgive me. Mister, is he dead? You just said "Everything's fine". We ate tangsuyuk, so everything will be fine. [Tangsuyuk - sweet sour pork] He died. Grandfather! The night of the 24th has finally arrived. Where should I go? =Tonight at 8:30pm, meet me at Myeongwol-ri Inn. Don't be late!= Tonight at 8pm, all residents of Myeongwol-ri must gather at the village hall. Attendance is mandatory. - Where's the ledger? - You told me to bring it here. Why did you come back? You had a chance to escape. Why didn't you? What are you doing? 1 minute left. 1 minute, what? Wasn't it 9pm? What are you actually doing? Can't we settle this by talking it out? Wait! Calm down first. Listen to me. Don't tell me... =It's over.= It's done. All of Myeongwol-ri, as well as the little kid, are dead. Gil Dong... In this world, there are people who are important and those who are not. It's okay to get rid of the unimportant ones. Like those we just killed. Help me... Forgive me! I really hope you'll join us. Long ago, father used to always worry about you. He said you would become dangerous. Why is this happening? What, aren't the guns any good? The Mayor. The chief of public security. You haven't met with them for some time now, right? So, what really happened here? =You bribed them with double the money. To contact them is impossible= If we don't do it correctly, there'll be a huge problem. =We have to do all this? You think we're experts?= Gunpowder? There shouldn't be any left. We've destroyed everything. The moment you pulled the trigger, you expected a shot, right? All the real bullets were used during your test. What are you guys doing? All the people you deceived were kidnapped. - We found them all. Should we catch them? - Of course. Why ask the obvious? Catch them all! But the sound of shooting that you heard at 8:30pm just now, what was that all about? You finally understand what happened, don't you? Kang Seong Il, the day after you met me, you became crazy. Although what happened to Kim Byeong Deok is not what I wanted. The real residents of Myeongwol-ri left home 2 hours ago. They're watching a movie right now. Just like what you did at another village, a movie with lots of gunfire was played to cover upp all the gunshot noises. They won't hear a thing. -There are those who shouldn't live... - Get out! ...people like you, who only think of power and do whatever pleasures you. Destroying people like you is my job. Even though I'm not a good guy myself... It's done. Is anyone there? Someone answer! =I'll answer you. What?= Put your weapon down if you want to live a little longer. =From now on, you'll see real hell.= Lets get this over with. This is your punishment for going up against Hong Gil Dong. - I'll forgive you all this time. So later, tell the truth. - Okay. If this ever happens again, we're going to meet. And next time it won't be settled with guns. A real clan of trash. A name I'd never heard before. Isn't that right, Kang Seong Il? The second son of Chief Hwang, leader of Gwangeunhwe... Once a soft and good hearted child. After you changed your name, how did you turn into a monster? Don't assume that you have won. You don't know us. Father will find you. You won't catch me... Because I'm someone who never even existed in this world. How can you catch me? Hyung, I don't even have an ID-card. Mal Soon! Kim Mal Soon! Kim Mal Soon, wake up now! Mister... Let's go! The next day, life went on like usual. At the work places. Same facial expressions, same thoughts as usual. Those who sacrificed themselves to find their loved ones...We lied about them. And innocently, people believed us. Nobody knows what really happened in this village. Controvercy surfaced after the leak of the Gwangeunhwe secret ledger. The existence of such an organization was proven. Those who were suspected to be related to them, were questioned thoroughly. The secret ledger of Gwangeunhwe brought with it a lot of suffering for people. The death of Kim Byeong Deok made Dong Yi heartbroken. Sis, where is grandfather? He's went to look for more money. Eat with me. Listen to your teachers. He'll be back. Let's go! OK. Grandfather. Dong Yi, are you still not talking to me? Grandfather is also like you. He hasn't slept well... because he always dreamt of the past. - Mal Soon... - Yes? Have I told you that my mother's a trash picker too? No. My mother...and I... Since I was little I'd earn my own money. Because of me, my mother couldn't eat miyeok. [Miyeok - seaweed If we had miyeok soup I would refuse to eat. She would say that since we only had soup, I needed to eat it. She'd take out all the miyeok and leave only rice and soup for me to eat. And she smelled like paper. - Mister, did your mother come back? - Yes. - Seriously? - Of course. - You're not lying again, are you? - It's true! What's this nonsense you're saying? It's nearby, right? Over there? Mister, is it true that we'll never meet again after this? It seems so. What if I miss you? If that happens... just remember me. We'll never forget you, Mister. We won't forget you no matter what. Mister! What? I saved this for you, I didn't even eat one. Here! It's okay, I don't have to eat it. Dong Yi, friends should share. Didn't you know? Mister, thank you. I don't have nightmares anymore. Because I know who I really am. And who my enemies are. The monster that shackled me... The minions from hell... With my own hands... -= Subtitles corrected, re-timed, re-synced and re-positioned by "romelrc" =- Thank you for using subtitles from: ~ Damn!SuperSub Indonesia ~
