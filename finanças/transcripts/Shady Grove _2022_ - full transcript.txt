I'm sure he'll show up. Or he gets my car impounded. Or that time we had to spend the night in Tijuana because we had to bail him out of jail? That was five years ago. Give the man some credit, he's a little better now. [Shaina] Mm. You don't smell that? All I smell is smoke. Look. Someone's been in here, Mark. -What are you talkin' about? -This lock. It's flipped backwards. Are you sure it wasn't like that already? Gimme some credit, okay? All right, look, maybe it was the owner. Right, what if she came when we was out? We weren't gone longer than an hour, and did you hear any cars coming up the driveway? No, baby, I wasn't paying attention. Look, I mean, Chloe's truck is gone. Did you hear that? All right, whatever. But I don't like it. I don't like this place, I don't like it here, I don't like not knowing where Eli is, and what's in this fuckin' pantry that smells so damn bad-- All right, okay, okay, okay, okay. Look, just do me a favor. Calm down. Breathe. And this is what today was supposed to be all about, right? We're gonna have plenty more freakouts for the rest of our lives. Let's not worry about Eli, or the dead bodies under the cabin. That's not funny. [Mark chuckling] Let's just enjoy our last few hours of peace and quiet. Now come have this nightcap with me. Okay. All right. [Mark sighing] -Come on, Michael Myers. -[Shaina chuckling] [crickets chirping] [Shaina sighing] Tired. What time is it? [sniffing] Like 9:30. It's cold out here, too. Let's see if there's a little life left in this fire. [sighing] [frightening music] [Shaina] What-- look. There's something out there. What? Don't you see it? There's something out there. Watching us. Babe, I don't see anything. Maybe it's just shadows or somethin' playin' tricks. Mark, I know what I saw. And someone is watching us. O-- okay. All right, all right. I believe you. Just go inside. You're not gonna come with me? I'm gonna put the fire out first. Just go on inside, lock the door and... -wait for me. -[Shaina] Well, don't be long. Right behind you. [sighing] [chilling music playing] [foliage rustling] Eli? [bucket clattering] [cell phone beeping three times] [cell phone ringing] Y'all hear that ringin'? It's the cops. [dispatcher] 9-1-1 operator. What's your emergency? Hello-- hello? Yes, yes, yes. Um, I called earlier. Me and my girlfriend are stayin' up over at, uh, 12 Turtle Lake Road. -Sir, is this about the cow? -It's not about the damn cow. Somebody's out here messin' with us. [water bubbling] [water splashing] Fuck! [terrifying music playing] [peaceful music playing] [fire crackling] [frightening chord] -[Shaina] What happened? -Close all the windows -a-- a-- and lock 'em. -What happened? What's wrong? -[Mark] Just do it! -Okay. [sinister music] [panting] Fuck. [Shaina] What did you see out there? What was it, Mark? Um... [Shaina] What was it? Uh... I think I saw somethin' i-- in the lake. I think it was a hand. What? I saw a fuckin' hand in the lake, Shaina. [Shaina] Like, a human hand? [Mark] Yeah. I'm pretty sure of it. We need to get outta here. Right, right, right. Give me your phone. It's in the car. Why the fuck would you leave it in the car? I don't know, Mark. Where's your phone? Where are the keys? [Shaina] You're not going out there. I'm just going to get the phone. -Mm-mm. -Babe, I'll be right back, all right? If somethin' happens, just flick the lights or somethin'. [car door thudding] [gravel crunching] Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on, Eli. [cell phone buzzing] Fuck. [Eli] Yo-yo, this is Eli. You know what to do. Eli, it's me. Call Shaina's phone as soon as you get this message. Somebody's out here fuckin' with us and we're about to bounce. I'mma try texting you. This piece of fuckin' shit. [car rumbling] Oh, shit. Did you recognize the car? No. Look, just turn off all the lights and stay away from the windows. You called Eli, didn't you? Yeah. But he, uh-- he didn't pick up. [Shaina] Sounds weird, but... I heard you calling him, Mark. From in here. I heard you calling him. That doesn't make sense. Are you sure? [Shaina] Call him again. Shh. Get-- get down. [knocking on door] [muffled voice] Hello? Sound like the girl from earlier. -Taylor? -[knocking on door] [muffled voice] Hello? [knocking on door] -Hey. -Oh, hey, sorry. I didn't know anyone was home. Uh, nah, it's all good, we were, uh, just in the back takin' a, uh, nap. Uh, come in, come in. I really didn't mean to interrupt. It's just I can't seem to find my car keys. Have you guys seen them? No, I, uh-- I haven't seen ca-- have you seen car keys? I haven't seen anything, I'm sorry. Okay, thanks. It was worth a shot. I'm just gonna go check outside. [Shaina] No, wait. Maybe you can help us. Um, when we got back, Eli was gone, and... he's not picking up his phone, so, I was just thinking, maybe since he was with your friend-- Yeah, yeah, yeah, you want me to text Chloe? -That would be great. -Yeah, of course. No problem. Hey, uh, you, uh, want some water or somethin'? Yeah, I'd love water. Thank you. [keyboard clacking] Hey. Are these yours? Oh, my gosh, thank you so much. -You're a lifesaver. -Where'd you find those? Just over there on the counter. But Taylor, you didn't come in here, did you? No, you guys didn't bring them inside? [Mark] Um, maybe Eli. [cell phone buzzing] Oh, it's Chloe. Okay, she said, "We're at drifters." Which is a bar in town, so-- And Eli's with her? [Taylor] Yes, she said Eli is with her, but he's really not feeling well. He's sick, so he's been in the bathroom, I guess. [Mark] I mean, that sound about right. Yeah. Uh, so-- so, I mean, what you wanna do, you wanna wait for him here or you wanna go -pick him up? -I wanna go. We can find us some cheapy hotel along the way, I don't care. But this place is freaking me out. All right, well, let's just go pack up our things and we'll just get him on the way out. Okay. Is everything all right? [Shaina] Yeah, it's just-- I'm not used to all this peace and quiet. It's just-- it's kind of making me crazy, and so I think we're just gonna cut this short and go home a little early. Mm, okay. [knocking on door] Are you guys expecting someone? No. [door creaks open] [Wingrad] Howdy, folks. I'm Sherriff Wingrad. I heard there was a disturbance out here this evening. Yeah, yeah, that-- that was me. Taylor, what are you doing here? I was hangin' out with Chloe. Did she ditch you again? When are you gonna learn that girl only has one thing on her mind? [Taylor] I know. [eerie music plays] All right. What seems to be the problem? Um... somebody's been messin' with us. Messin' how? Somebody was watching us down by the fire. All right. Can you describe 'em for me? It was dark, and I only got a glimpse. What about you? Well, no, I mean, I actually-- I didn't see anything. So, you think you saw somebody but you can't be sure. Mark, why don't you tell her about what you saw down at the lake? It's probably best if I show you. Lead the way. Taylor, do you think you can keep an eye on that young lady while we're gone? Yeah, not like I have anywhere else to be. All right. Lock the door behind us, just to be safe. All right, let's go. What'd I miss? Look. It was... it was over here. [mysterious music plays] Hey, watch it, watch it. What am I lookin' for? I-- I came down to get water to-- to put out the fire, okay, and... I'm tellin' you, it was a noise, or a splash or somethin', and I shine my light and it was right there. It was a fuckin' hand. [eerie chanting] I notice you kids are having a little party back in the cabin. You take any drugs? I mean, I had a couple beers, all right? But-- I know it sounds crazy, but I know what I saw. It was a severed hand in the water. [Wingrad] Okay, relax now. I'm not trying to bust you, I'm just trying to figure out what it is you really saw. [eerie chanting] Oh, shit. Yo... Fuck. [sighs] Do you wear glasses or contacts? When I read, yeah. And did you have 'em in earlier? -No. -[Taylor] Okay. Chloe just said that they're gonna head back once your friend is good enough to ride in her car without getting too sick. [Shaina sighing] Fuckin' asshole. Uh, in his defense, no one ever says no to Chloe. I could see that. Eli made a joke that it must be something in the water. It's more like a limited gene pool. Everyone in Shady Grove is related, which makes dating a nightmare. It's also really hard to stand out when everyone looks the exact same. It's why I got the ink. To stand out. -Do you wanna see? -Sure. -[peaceful music plays] -Check it out. [Shaina] Oh, my God. It's amazing. [Taylor] I mean, that's what everyone tells me, but I can't really see it for myself. How long did it take? Took about a year, on and off. Basically whenever I had money to pay for it. [Shaina] It looks painful. Did it hurt? Not really, I mean, it's kind of the point, right? Yeah, I guess. Do you have any tattoos? Yeah, just this little... I actually got it with Eli. It's so cute. [Shaina] Mark used to have this really tiny coupe. Um, and I'm-- mind you, I'm super claustrophobic, so I refused to sit in the back, and Eli had to every single time. And so, he used to kick the back of the seat and scream, "Oh, Shaina needs to spread her wings." Now, I know that he was making fun of me, but it kinda stuck. -Like, literally. -Mm-hmm. Yeah. Do you remember seein' a farm that you passed on the way here? Yes, what-- why? Yeah, well, that's the Hilton boys' farm. We've been gettin' complaints for years about their improper disposal of livestock. Sometimes they just pile 'em up in a big pile and burn 'em. Causing a funk you would not believe. Other times, they'll just chop up the bits and toss 'em right in there. The-- well, I don't know, all right? Maybe. I-- maybe. Look, you are not the first person who's called in a panic because some nasty carcass parts have washed up to shore. But, um, while the Hilton boys are certainly not rocket scientists, they are not killers. [eerie chanting] [Wingrad] All right, hoh, hoh! Hey, are you okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I just... got lightheaded for a second. I'm gonna ask you one more time... are you on somethin'? No. All right, look, this is-- a lot's been happenin' in the day, okay? I-- I just forgot to eat. All right, well, let's get you back to the cabin. Come on. Did you and Eli ever hook up? No. God, no. He is not my type. -And your boyfriend is-- -More my type? -Oh. -[Shaina] Yeah. -Nice. -Mm-hmm. They're both really cute. [Shaina] Oh, you have to-- [sinister music plays] [Shaina] Wait... how did you know to do that? Jiggle it? Oh, I-- I guess I saw you guys do it earlier. -[knocking on door] -[Wingrad] Hey! [Shaina] What-- what happened to him? [Wingrad] Exactly what I've been askin'. [Mark] I'm good. [Wingrad] I already asked him if he's on something. [Mark] I'm just tired. [Wingrad] And the bloodshot eyes? He's not drunk, he only had one glass of wine. Well, my advice would be to drink a lot of water and try to get some sleep. Come on, did you show her what you saw outside? Yes, babe, all right? But maybe-- I don't know, maybe I-- Someone came in here while we were outside and they went in there. [Wingrad] And what's in there? I don't know. It's locked. But we heard our friend's phone ringing from in there. [Wingrad] You think your friend is in the pantry? I don't know what to think. I just know what I heard. And there is this smell. Don't you smell it? I only smell the fire. Hello? It's the sheriff. Anybody in there? What's his number? Why don't I just call him? Um, uh, 312... 869... 4021. [cell phone ringing] [Shaina] Put it on speaker. 312-869-4021. -[Shaina] Mm-hmm. -[cell phone ringing] -[Taylor] What-- -Put it on speaker! [cell phone ringing] [voicemail] Yo, yo, this is Eli, you know what to do. [sighing] [Shaina] Sorry. Didn't mean to flip out like that. It's really not a problem. I'm gonna head out anyways. It's getting really late. But why don't I give you my number just in case your friend doesn't show up? Thank you. [Wingrad] Well, I don't know what to tell you. My best advice would be to lock the doors and just try to get some shuteye. All right, you folks have my number. You give me a call if anything out of the ordinary happens. And for the record... I don't think the two of you are crazy. I think you did see somethin' out there. There's a lot of hanky stuff out there, but it doesn't mean it meant you any harm. All right? Now, if I don't hear from you, I will be here first thing in the morning to check on you. -You take care. -[Shaina] Thank you. What the fuck was that, Mark? [engine revving] [ominous music] Did you and Eli take something? No. What was it? Shrooms? Ecstasy? -Tell me that you-- -No, I wouldn't do no shit like that, all right, without tellin' you. Man, give me some credit. I ain't you. What's that supposed to mean? [scoffs] You don't think I know what's going on between you and Taylor? There is nothing going on with me and Taylor. She gave me her number just in case Eli didn't come back. No, I saw the way you looked at her, all right? Everybody saw that shit. It's embarrassin'. You let me talk like a crazy person, you don't think that's embarrassing? So, what, this is payback? I mean, the-- the moment you expect me to be there for you and understand when you betray me, but the moment you feel like I don't have your back, you punish me? I am not trying to punish you, Mark. There is something fucked up happening here, and you and nobody else is listening to me. Then call your fuckin' girlfriend. Maybe she'll listen. Hey, whoa, what are you doing? Nothing fucking happened. What are you doing? They gonna make us pay for that. I don't care. [lock clanging] [Mark] You just had to know, huh? What? Thanks for having my back. How's this my fault? [crickets chirping] [TV crackling] [woman singing on TV] [indistinct chatter on TV] [blanket rustling] I'll be in the shower. Babe? Yeah, I heard you. You gonna be mad at me for the rest of the night? I don't wanna fight. I just wanna get past this night and get on with the rest of our lives. Together. Okay. Whatever. [TV chatter continues] Peace offering. [groaning] You ate a bite. I had to. Had to make sure it wasn't poisoned. But you don't even like ice cream. I know. No, seriously. What are you on? Life. [laughing] No, seriously. I'm just exhausted. Promise. I know. -[kissing noises] -Go get in the shower. Okay. Hey. Don't drown in there. You do care.
