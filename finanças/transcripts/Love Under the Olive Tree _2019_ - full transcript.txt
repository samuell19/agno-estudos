Hey. - Did you see the new, flashy Brandini sign on your way in? - They love reminding people about their contest wins. Not this time. - It'll only be fair for a ranch like Cabella, where we actually do the work ourselves, to win. I know. Oh. Oh. Hi, we didn't hear you come home. How could you over the music? - Your mother, your mo... Your mother signed us up for, uh, for a dance class, it's our first day. - Dance class? Seriously? May I remind you of our ill-fated father/daughter dance in third grade? - A little embarrassment for my only daughter was worth it for the grin on her face. - I mean, it's not like I was much better. It's the Cabella curse, two left feet. Before you go, there's something we need to discuss. - All right. - Ready? - Grandpa has decided it's time for him to retire. And I'm gonna take over Cabella Oil. - Are you sure? - I wanna relax, travel the world, but my protege here will continue the Cabella legacy. - This is such wonderful news. Do you feel like you're ready for this responsibility, Nicole? - Of course she is. - Grandpa has been training me my entire life, and I have big ideas to take the ranch to the next level. - Beginning with the competition. You're entering again? - Obviously. - I just don't wanna see you disappointed, honey. - She can't help herself. Olive oil is in her blood. Heck, it may even be her blood. - Adam and I have been studying new techniques for our recipe, and I really think we finally have a shot this year. - Oh, guys, one second. Granddad, how are you? - Hiya, Jake. Hey, it's olive-harvest season, I thought perhaps you'd like to come down to Sunset Valley for the weekend? - Uh, this weekend? - I could probably give you that traditional olive oil lesson we've been planning. It's perfect timing, we're developing our submission for the annual contest. - Well, you know I'd love to, uh, but-- - But you've got work to keep you busy. - Yeah, actually I do. In fact, I'm due in court right now. - No, of course. Hey, break a leg. - Thanks, Granddad, I will. - Ready to work on another batch? - Yes, I am. But first, guess what, I'm officially in charge of Cabella. - What? Oh, my god, that's amazing! But, wait, I'm not gonna have to start calling you boss, am I? - Well, technically... - After working together for six years? - Six years? Has it been that long? - It was only supposed to be for a summer while you apprentice with Frank, but here I am. - Head ranch hand, and my best friend. - Well, consider this best friend thoroughly impressed. So what are you working on here? - Um, it's my concept for expanding the tasting facility. I just, you know, I don't know if I'm ready to take on a big renovation like this. - Well, I approve. Have you found a contractor? - Yep. And I filed a construction permit. - I am so proud of you. - Okay, let's get cracking, because this olive oil contest isn't gonna win itself. So let's go. - Yep. - Jake, congrats on the big win. Great job. - Thank you, Julie. Oh. - Of course. We'll talk later? Right. Hey, Mom, great news-- What do you mean, is Granddad okay? I'm on my way. Can you, uh, take care of this for me? - Okay, before Grandpa leaves on his vacation, I wanted to show you all of my plans for expanding the ranch. - Wow. You weren't kidding about having grand ideas. - Well, it's still a work in progress, but this is what I had in mind. We'd offer the same tastings we already do, but on a much bigger scale. We'd add a terrace with a bistro and finally showcase the beautiful view. Adam had some really great ideas for its rustic, chic design. - Aww, Adam is such a sweetie. I don't know why the two of you aren't together. I'm hardly his type. Let's stay focused on the plan. So, what are your thoughts? - Well, if you can pull it off, it'll be wonderful. What do you think, Dad? - I love it. - Really? Yeah. Yes. - Mom. - Jake, how was the drive? - What does that matter? How's Granddad? - Well, you know-- - He is perfectly all right. And I do not need this thing. Ow! - He fell and broke his arm. Dad, you're anything but all right, Dad. - Jake, what on earth are you doing here? - Well, Mom said you were in the hospital, and so I came right away. - Honestly, Eleanor, did you have to make such a fuss? Come on, let's get you home. - You were in the hospital. Oh, I know, you're a sweet, sweet girl, but really, there's nothing wrong with me. - Mom, why did you make it sound like he was having a medical emergency? - Well, I didn't know how serious his injury was when I spoke to you. Besides, I thought that it might motivate you to come. - You're kidding? I was frantic. - Well, if you visited more often, I wouldn't have to be so creative. - Thanks. What can I do for you, my good man? - Can I get a cold brew to go, please? - I'm afraid we only carry the hard stuff here. - That's fine. - Jake. - Billy. - Is that you? - What are you doing in Sunset Valley? - Yeah, yeah, still here. Big fish, small pond, as they say. - Hmm. - I bought this place a few years back, it's my spot now. - Well, that's great. - You're no slouch either, look at this getup, I'm gonna have to charge you double. - For this service, hardly. Traitor. - No, no, we are an equal-opportunity supplier. We don't take sides here. - Because if you did, you'd have to choose Cabella. Hey, Billy. - Hey, I'll go grab your order. - Thanks. - Wow. You sure clean up nice. - Excuse me? - You don't recognize me? Bit of a hit to the ego, but I think I can recover. - Oh, all you had to say was ego and the memories just came flooding back. If it isn't Jake Brandini, ghost of childhood's past. - You still living with your folks at the ranch? - Oh, actually, I run Cabella now. - Wow, congrats, I remember that was always the dream. - You remember something I said when we were kids? - Uh, I also remember that time where you tripped and fell after we raced to the factory. Yes, but if memory serves, I won, so... - Yeah, that part, I don't recall. - Oh, no, you don't recall, huh? - No. Okay. Well, time sure flies when you're becoming a big-time corporate lawyer. I... That's, I heard that's what you do. - Oh, did you? - Uh, thanks, Billy. Here you go. - Oh, thanks. - Well, that was sure a blast from the past. See you in, what, another 15 years? - Bye, Sticky Nicki. - Nobody calls me that anymore. So, how long you in town anyway? - Head back to San Francisco tomorrow. - I guess those tech zillionaires aren't gonna sue themselves. - Someone's gotta do it. You know, on my way back, I noticed the Cabellas are building near the property line. Anyway, hey, Granddad, maybe after breakfast, you can give me that lesson we've been planning. - Oh, no, he's on strict orders to take it easy. We still don't know what caused him to fall, and he shouldn't be operating any machinery. - Okay. Well, how about a stroll of the property? To the Cabella border and back, for old times' sake. - Yeah. - I don't know what ever appealed to you about going over there. - Not after the way Frank Cabella treated your grandfather. - Are you guys ever gonna let that go? - I don't see why your new terrace has to be so close to the Brandini border. How can you handle the proximity to that family? - Based on the budget, we can only afford to expand the existing facility, not start fresh. - And it should be fine. I've never seen anyone from Brandini's over there. Mr. Cabella, didn't you guys start the ranch together? What went wrong? - Well... - Here we go again. - Right out of the gate, we were doing better than we expected. I wanted to make some big moves. - Raphael was offered a lucrative opportunity to expand, so he decided to squeeze me out. - I begged Frank to join in on the international project, but he refused. - He started making deals behind my back. - All I wanted was to confirm that the offers were sound before I presented them. - He was willing to abandon years of friendship just to build an empire. - He never even let me explain. - So we split up the ranch and went our separate ways. - To this day, I've never met anyone who knew his way around an olive oil press better than Frank Cabella. - The Cabellas only care about being right. - The Brandinis only care about the bottom line. - Come on. Let's go for that stroll. - Sure, Granddad. - Hey, I wanna show you the old map that I found. Cabellas and that property line. - Are you sure this map is accurate? - I don't know why it wouldn't be, why do you ask? - 'Cause based on these property lines, the border goes right through that, which is encroachment. - Hmm. - Jake, twice in two days. Did you, uh, did you come looking for some quality oil? - Why? Do you stock Brandini's now? - How do you do, Mr. Brandini? - Hello, Nicole. - So, uh, what's all this? - This is the site of my future world-renowned dining and tasting facility. - Well, I'm afraid you may have to relocate it, because it appears to be on our land. Right through that. - What? Um, I'll be right back. - Sure. - What brings you by, Raphael? - Well, my grandson has made a fascinating discovery, it seems that you might be in violation of our original land agreement. - Mr. Cabella, if you could just take a look at this. - Are you arms the only thing broken, Raphael? Violation? That's absurd. - Your information is way off, according to this deed, we have plenty of room. - Well, this deed hasn't been witnessed. And there's no way you can prove its authenticity. Based on this official map, your property ends here. There. - Mm, here. - There. - Mm, here. - We have been using this land for decades. - Well, for now, you'll have to stop. - An injunction, Jake filed an injunction against me. - Here's a copy of the complaint, she shoulda received it this morning. She can't proceed with any of the construction plans until the matter's resolved. - Look, is this really something we should pursue? - Of course we should. An agreement's an agreement, the Cabellas are required to adhere to the terms. - So many years have already gone by. - Do you want me to cancel my cruise? - No way, you deserve this trip, plus, there's no chance that Jake's theory holds up. - I know you'll figure it all out. - Do you still think I'm good enough to run this company on my own? Because I'm afraid. - Oh, my dear, you are more than good enough. You're the future of Cabella Oil. - I'll be back in a couple of weeks for the court date. - You really wanna do that? - Maybe we can settle this quietly. - They wouldn't want the negative publicity impacting their image. - That's true. Maybe we can settle this quietly. - Still working on your construction plans? It needs to be ready to go once we get the green light from the judge. - And if we don't get the green light? - I can't let my mind go there. I already gave a large deposit to the construction company before Jake interrupted everything. - Well, Cabella could still recover from that. - Maybe, but I can't let my first big move be a massive disaster, I couldn't recover from that. - Okay, well, before you drive yourself crazy with the hearing, let's focus on our contest submission. So this batch combines our buttery texture that we liked from batch 12 with the concentration from batch 27. - No, it's still missing something. - You always say that. - I just, I don't know what it needs, this is hopeless. - Let's try a slight reduction of the core temperature on the next batch. - What would I do without you? - Develop subpar oil? Yeah. - How's discovery progressing on the Atkinson copyright case? - Well, the startup we filed the suit against definitely infringed on the graphic, but-- - But? - But if we win, the startup will go bankrupt. We could negotiate. - No chance. The partners are really impressed with you, Jake. - You both have compelling evidence, but I can't rule on this without seeing a forensic investigation first. - We're willing to do whatever it takes, Your Honor. - So are we. - Well, even then, it'll take time and money. I suggest you find a private resolution so I can get back to judging your olive oil submissions. Wait, that's it. - What is, Judge Monroe? - Whichever ranch wins the contest also wins the land. - With all due respect, Your Honor, you can't be serious? - Well, you're competing anyway, aren't you? This would save you the trouble of litigation. - This is highly unconventional. - I know, isn't it exciting? - It would speed things up. But what do you know about making oil? - How hard can it be? Why? Are you afraid of a little challenge? - Absolutely not. - Then we have a deal? - Deal. What did I just do? Did I seriously just bet the future of the ranch on a contest? - So it would seem. - What was I thinking? - Just relax, take a deep breath. - No, but if we, if we lose the competition, we won't simply be forced to abandon construction, I will have failed my grandpa's belief that I can take over this company. - Okay, so we won't. - We won't what? - We won't lose. - You say that like it is so simple. - Before Jake got to town, you had all the confidence in the world. - That was when all that was at stake was a trophy and my pride. - A winning submission is still a winning submission, no matter the prize. - I just spoke with my boss, I'm not going back to San Francisco until after the contest. If I'm gonna win this thing, I'm gonna need to stay here. - Wonderful. It's about time you took some interest. You should ask your grandfather for some pointers. - And you'll get to enjoy the Fall Festival, it's the highlight of the year. - It's one, two, three. - There's forward and then there's back two-- Top of the morning. - You sound chipper. - Well, a good night's sleep does wonders. Thank you. I am off to town to grab a few things, then it's back to the salt mines. I really think Adam and I are close to cracking the recipe. Mm, it's good. Yep, I think we're really close. - Great. - Maybe we should call my dad and have him settle with the Brandinis, instead of relying on the results of a contest. - No, no, I won't let them take advantage of us, not again. - I wish she wasn't so impulsive. - Oh, glad to see you out, Raphael. - Afternoon, Judge. - Well, I reckon you won't be golfing with us anytime soon. - Ron Evans. - Jake Brandini. - High school principal, oil judge extraordinaire. You know, your grandfather spends the better part of 18 holes just bragging about your accomplishments. - Is that so? Well, that's very nice to hear, Mr. Evans. - We should be on our way, it would be poor form for two of the judges to be seen fraternizing with the incumbent winner. Bye now. Nice to meet you. - You too. So I spent all night last night researching oil-making. I found a surprising number of online instructional videos. - That's a good start, but you can't learn about oil from research, you have to put your back into it. - Oh. Okay then, well, will you show me around the factory? - I'd love to. Oh, god. - Oh, let me give you a hand. Oh, it's you. I didn't realize, may I? - Nope. And I thought nothing was gonna put a damper on my day. I will be fine, thanks. - Come on, everyone knows you're athletic, there's no need to be a hero. - I don't need you to rescue me, and I am hardly a damsel in distress. - That might be the last thing I'd ever use to describe you. Come on, Nicki, let me help. - The name is Nicole, and I would rather not accept help from the person causing me endless grief. He is inescapable. I don't see him for 15 years, and now I can't go 10 minutes without bumping into him. - Weren't you guys friends when you were younger? - Not exactly. He lived in San Francisco, but he spent summers here when we were kids, and we used to meet up by the border. - All right, so what was he like growing up? - He always had to have the best toys, and then you had to endure a lecture on all of his rules before you could play with any of them. - We should take this energy, bottle it up, and see what it does to our flavor. - I am just frustrated, it is hard to deal with someone like him who has it all, brains, privilege, good looks. - Good looks, huh? - Okay, if you like the traditionally-handsome guys, I suppose. He is, he is not my type. - Uh-huh, well, he might not be your type, but would it kill you to get your head out of the olive press, go out for a night on the town? - I go out. - Yeah, with me and our friends, but I mean out out, as in a date. - That is the last thing on my mind, and you should talk. - I just haven't met anyone interesting yet. - You will, just takes time. Oh, you have got to be kidding me. What are you doing over here? - Oh. Good afternoon. I needed somewhere quiet to work while I stayed here, so I set up a temporary office. It also allows me to keep an eye on my property. - Staying here, as in Sunset Valley? - Yeah, just until I win back the land. - You are actually taking a spin at production, you sure you even know what olive oil is made of? - I can work at my job remotely and prepare for the contest here. Two birds, one stone. - Is one of your birds the culprit responsible for this? - I didn't want you getting any ideas about moving forward with your expansion. Considering you're here, I was right to be concerned. You always did take the rules a little too liberally. - Okay, if you're referring to the Sunset Valley Camp presidential election, I maintain I used valid campaign tactics, you didn't have to file your grievances. - You shoulda checked the handbook, that's all I'm saying. - You are still exactly the same. - You were so upset with me after that. Was that why you stopped coming to meet me here? - Yeah, totally. Later, Jake. - Bye, Nicole. - Welcome, everyone. We are kicking off another fantastic Fall Festival, so grab an apple cider while they're still hot. - Oh, uh, I'm afraid that's taken. - And remember, the final event on day 10 is our very prestigious olive oil competition, which is always quite exciting. So grab a brochure, we have lots of fun things lined up over the next 10 days, including the big race, the Cornucopia 500. - Oh-oh. Oh, oh. - Here you go. Jake. My VIP finally made it. Come on, I saved you the best seat in the house. - Thanks, Billy. No problem. - Attention, all. The sign-up for tomorrow's apple-picking contest is now open. Who will be the victor? Find out tomorrow, right here in Sunset Valley. I'm in. Thank you. - Me too. - Welcome, everyone. Okay, on my go, you will have exactly three minutes to collect as many red apples as you can and bring your baskets back to me. That's red apples, no green apples will be accepted. - Are you taking notes? - Okay, the person with the heaviest basket wins a dinner for two at the Sunset Valley Diner. - Does that dinner include a bottle of wine? - I might throw in a bottle for a lucky someone. On your marks, get set, go. - What, are you making a pie afterwards? Why are you being so picky? - I only want the best. - Oh, so typical. - Slow and steady wins the race. Timeless saying for a reason. - That's your one-minute mark, people, one minute remaining! - You sure you're gonna be able to handle all of that? Looks a little precarious. - You're safe, safe, you're safe, safe. - Oh. - Oh, no. You're safe, safe, safe, very good job. Very safe, safe. Safe. And time. - Oh, come on. - Jake, I am very sorry, but you are disqualified. Ah, Nicole, half a bushel, very sad. Good job, everyone. Nice apple picking. Can I have your attention, please? With an impressive 22 pounds of apples, the winner is Adam Caulfield. - What? - The grand prize, good sir. Hey, at least you and Nicole both lost. - I guess? - Well, I, for one, was in no mood for a Brandini/Cabella feud-induced argument. - Yeah, but Adam won, so it's like she won too. - How do you mean? - She's obviously gonna be his plus-one. - We'll see. - Is your ankle okay, Sticky Nicki? I mean Nicole. Old habits. You want, uh, you want some ice? - I'm fine, it was just a little twist, but thank you. - Why do you call her that anyway? - Sticky Nicki? I thought everyone knew that. We were doing a three-legged race, she was going way too fast for her own good, tripped, fell, gum went flying in the air, she landed on top of it. Before we realized, it was too late, she had to cut off a big chunk of her hair. - I remember that summer, you had to wear bangs, didn't you? That was a bad look for you, you shouldn't do that anymore. - What? - I'm sorry, but it's true. - Yeah. Yeah, it was. Hey there. You kids have fun yesterday? Sort of, but I didn't win, and we really could've used the time to work on the recipe. - Well, you can't work yourself to the bone, you should be out enjoying yourself. - That's what I keep telling her. You should listen to your father, he's wise. - Okay, the contest is seven days away, I can consider having some fun after that. I might even take an entire day off. - You can make it a spa day. - Have I ever struck you as a spa-day kinda girl? - You are gonna at least attend the festival activities, aren't you? You always love this time of year. Maybe, but, have you both forgotten that the future of the company is at risk? I promised Grandpa I was ready to take the reigns, and I can't let him down. - Whatever the outcome, we are all here to support you. - Oh, hey, Mom. Heading out to the factory. - Your father is delighted at your dedication to the contest. - Well, I'm glad, it's time I learned more about the family business. - Well, you used to love to run around and play with the processing tools. But once you started high school, you decided you didn't wanna come back here. - Yeah, well, that's why I'm back, to make up a bit of that lost time. - We like getting out here too, it's so peaceful. So, what's going on in San Francisco? - Well, you know. You still seeing that woman you told me about? - Nah, it didn't work out. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear it. - It's all right, it's for the best, more time to focus on work. Speaking of which, my firm is sending over a box of files. If everything goes well with this case, I'll be on track to make partner. - That's great, Jake. - Yeah. - As long as it makes you happy. - Yeah. - Everyone, this is my grandson, Jake, I'll be showing him around today. Hello, everyone. - While I'm recovering, he'll be the front line for all things production. This is the centrifuge that extracts the oil from the olives. Bottling and labeling. Boxing and crating. Oh, don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. We all have to start somewhere. You've always said you wanted to learn this, I just wish I didn't have this busted wing so I could give you the real lesson on the traditional press. - There's so much more to this operation than I ever realized. - Yeah, it's a lotta hard work, but I've always enjoyed it. - I can see why. Thanks, Granddad. I should get back to my case. - Okay. How's the tasting going? - Everyone seems to be having a nice time. - Hey, where'd this come from? I brought it in from the living room for a little motivation. - And what's this bottle here? - That is the Cabella Sunset, it was the very first recipe I helped develop. - Wow. I'd like to try that. - Unfortunately, it was a limited batch we made using the antique press. - Well, at least you still get to bust out the old girl for your small-batch lessons. - Yeah. - I saw a bunch of people leaving here earlier. - I was hosting a tasting for a small group of tourists. But when my expansion plan goes through-- - If. - When it goes through, it will allow for much larger groups. - So, why here? - It's my favorite place on the entire ranch, because it has the perfect sunset view. The only place that the Brandini factory doesn't get in the way. - So you're blaming me for that now? - I was just answering your question. - Mm. - Why do you care about this land so much? - I just wanna do what's right for my family, make them proud. - But you don't, you don't know anything about oil production. - That may be, but every company needs strong leadership and management. That, I can do, with my business acumen. - Did you seriously just say acumen about yourself? - I have acumen to spare. Okay. - I do wish I'd had more hands-on experience. And I regret how little time I spent at the ranch since we were kids. You're right, it is beautiful here. - Just... Okay, just promise me one thing, if you win-- - When. If. You make sure that nothing gets in the way of this perfect view. - I promise. - Table 12. - Hey. - You stalking me? - Wow. Good morning to you too. I will have my usual, Billy. And just so you know, this is my go-to place, so who is stalking who? Here you go. - Thank you. Everything okay? - Yeah, uh, two servers called in sick this morning, so... - I can help out, it'll be like old times. Thank you. You used to work here? - During high school, she was the permanent employee of the month. - Oh, well, then I can lend a hand too. Oh. Wow, Jake Brandini doing hard labor. That I've gotta see. - You're on. Uh, okay, let's get to work. Let's go. Apple pie, order up! - That's for me. - That's mine. Thank you. - Uh, I will go get you another one, sir. - Thank you for your patience, this is on the house. - Thank you, Nicole. - Unbelievable. Huh, a little greasing of the wheel never hurt, I suppose. - Are you accusing me of greasing the wheel? - Hey... - I think we both know you deserve that. - Thank you. I will get you another one. - Great. - Jake, what are you doing here? - Trying to increase the bitterness. Bitter is a positive, who knew? - Very good. Winning this year is more important than ever. - I know. Six days left to get it right. - It's also key we stay aware of what's happening in the industry. - You mean check out the competition? - In so many words. Just ensure we're leading trends, not falling behind on them. Hmm. - Welcome, everyone. Today, we'll be using the traditional olive oil press, and when we're done, you'll leave with your own, personal blend. - Apologies for my tardiness, everyone. - Uh-- - Oh, please, continue. - No, I'm afraid we're fully booked. - I think I just snagged the last spot, online. - Everyone, please take your place at a station. No, you can't be here. - Why not? I'm a paying customer. Is there a problem with my confirmation email? - Okay, yep, fine, fine. - Thank you. - The technique I'm about to teach you was developed by Cabella Oil's founder, and my grandpa, Frank. - Question. Don't you mean Raphael Brandini? - We're visiting Brandini tomorrow. - Oh, that, that won't be necessary. You're gonna learn everything you need right here. - I'm gonna post this, should I tag you? - Don't bother, Nicole doesn't have social media. She's old-school. - And how would you know? - Huh? Oh, um... - Making olive oil shouldn't be done by a formula. You have to follow your instincts. Look. See? It's perfect. Good job. That consistency is really nice. - Thank you. How am I doing, teach? - You might wanna infuse more herbs for flavor, but it's... It's quite nice. You did a lovely job. - That was really hard for you to say, wasn't it? - It was, yeah. You're here at a very scenic time, because tomorrow, all of the olives will actually be harvested from the trees. - What are you building here? We are expanding. - Oh, hey, Granddad. Here, have a seat. - Listen, you and Maxwell need to stop treating me like an invalid. You sure you don't need to get back to San Francisco? - Nope, I promised I'd stay until I cleared out the dispute. - Ah. - And you are the one who says Brandinis always keep their word. - So where'd you get that? - Oh. It's, um... I took a class, at the Cabellas'. I figured that since you couldn't give me the lesson yourself, I would surprise you. So, surprise. - Spending some time with Nicole again, huh? Just like when you were kids. - You knew? - Of course I knew. You used to come back from your little adventures happy as a clam. I never told your father, because I knew he'd put a stop to it. - And you didn't mind? - No. I was glad you weren't burdened by my conflict with Frank, it had nothing to do with you children. Try this. Oh, that's excellent. Mm. A nutty and very harmonious flavor. It actually reminds me of the original batch that Frank and I developed together. He must've taught Nicole well. - It was a lot of fun. But the Brandinis aren't exactly slacking off. - No, we aren't, but, uh, things sure aren't what they used to be. - Yeah, that factory does seem to follow some guidelines that are fairly strict with their formulas and regulations-- - That's it precisely. Manufacturing has become just too, I don't know, too manufactured. Back in my prime, I really got my hands dirty. - That reminds me. Look what I found. - Wow. That takes me back. Oh, man, we had a lotta good times. I really miss those days. So what do you think of our latest batch? - Mm, it still lacks pizzazz. And we need to work on our overall design, the judges take the overall package into consideration. Brandini's is just so perfect. I mean, look at this presentation. - Yeah, but it's what's in the bottle that really matters. And Jake must be worried, I mean, he did take your class. - I know. I can't believe he had the audacity to look me up online. I mean, he must've been really bored. Uh, you logged into my account to look him up two days ago, so... - That, that was different, that was for corporate research. None of them are just right. - One, and two, - Two, three, four, five, - and three, and four, and... - six, seven, eight. It's an eight count. - No, it's one, and two, and three, and four, and. How's the submission going, honey? - Um, well, we've narrowed it down to these options, but I... I don't know which one to choose. Maybe you guys could tell me what you like. - Oh, sure. - Yeah. - Okay, um, the first one is more woody, and for this one, we incorporated floral hints. - Oh, my goodness me, that is fantastic. - I like the taste of that one, I can totally serve that with food. - That is so robust. - I don't know, it really depends on how... - You know what, you are the expert, you will know which one to choose. - Yeah, I guess so. - Oh, yeah. - And remember, Grandpa will be home in a couple of days. - Right. - He wouldn't miss the contest for the world. - Right. We got dance class, so, it's salsa day. But listen, honey, you've got two winners there. They're both fantastic, you are killing it. Yeah? - The rosemary infused in this batch made it unbalanced. And this is too strong. Back to the drawing board. - So if you guys start with that section over there, that'd be great. All right, you all know what to do, thanks, guys. Hey, um, I think we should use the olives from today in our next trial. - Okay, but as you know, they've been on the trees longer, so they will have a different... - Good morning. - Hi. - What, what brings you by? - I was, uh, wondering if I could help out with the harvest? - Seriously? Why here? - Well, the Brandinis, we use industrial machines for the harvest, you guys do it the old-fashioned way, the true way. - Still, I don't think it's a good idea for you to be out here. - Well, you said yourself I should try a day in the field. Challenge accepted. Besides, I went into town and rustled up proper attire. - Those boots are so pristine, you could be in a catalog. - Oh, be nice, I think he looks sharp, almost authentic even. - Thank you, Adam. So, what do you say? Can I stay? - You promise to behave? Alrighty then. You can shadow me. - Yes! Are you suggesting I have delicate hands. - Oh, come on, don't be so sensitive. See, we all wear gloves. - Okay then. Thank you. Oh, uh, before we get started, found something I think you'll get a kick out of. Look at that. - Wow. You know, I forgot there was a time when our grandfathers actually used to work the land together. - Pretty cool, huh? - Yeah. I'll, um, I'll show this to my grandpa when he gets back into town, I'm sure he'll love it. - Sounds good. All right, let's get these protective gloves on. What do you think? Am I a natural in the making or what? - Not exactly. Here, okay, I'll show you how it's done. If you take the branch like this, and then go like that, you actually get it done a lot faster. Thanks. - Yeah, you take that tree. - Got it. - Um, I will be over here. - You get that one. - Yeah. - Great. - How'd you do? - It went pretty good, almost full. Whoa, you really are a pro. - Yeah, well, you know, running a ranch is so much more than just picking olives. I have to get better at managing the books. You know, I'm trying to improve my business acumen. - Well, the guys at the ranch, they have a program for that, I can send it to you. - Really? - Yeah, done. - Thank you. - Thanks for today. You're a pretty good teacher. - Well, you turned out to be a pretty good student. Quite helpful, so, well done. - Oh, don't go soft on me, I won't know how to react. Okay. - Oh, ow, okay, that's more like the Nicole I remember. - So, staying on the ranch must be way different from what you're used to in San Francisco? - You have no idea. Do you ever get out that way? - Yeah, yeah, I drive out pretty often, I go to a lot of Giants games. - Really? Well, my firm, we get season tickets. I should take you to a game one time. You and, you and Adam. - That would be amazing. - Yeah. - Okay, um, you know, I should get these cleaned and processed before they turn. You're a machine. I gotta rest up for the big race. - Wait, you're doing the Cornucopia 500? - You know it. - See you at the finish line. If you're lucky. Challenge accepted. - Uh, keep 'em, for next time. - Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the Cornucopia 500! Racers, no bumping, pushing, grabbing, or shoving. You taking notes? Always. We want a clean race. Hey. - Three laps for the win. Racers, start your engines. On your marks, get set, go! No! Eat my dust. You're never gonna catch me, no, no, no. - Oh, yeah? - Woo! Yeah. You're not gonna win. No! How does my dust taste, huh? Jake is in the lead. Oh, Nicole's creeping up. This is a close one. One lap to go. Racers, it's your final lap. - Woo! No way. Good try, but not gonna happen. Coming around the bend now. No, no, what are you doing? Up to the finish line. - What are you doing? No! No way! That is not fair! Hey, no fair, he said no grabbing, you totally broke the rules. You and your rules. - Hey, congratulations. Oh, thank you. - Everybody's gonna go for drinks later. - Yeah, you wanna come? - Um, you know, I'm gonna sit this one out. You guys have fun. Uh, congrats. Okay, thanks. Check this out. - Wow. You know what? I think I love it. But, you know, the contest, it's only four days away, and we aren't gonna win just because of an interesting font. - Well, we aren't going to lose, you keep saying that this is our year. - I know. But it is, it's more than just a contest, it's the company's future at stake. - Right, so let's get back to work, champ. - Champ. Yeah. Oh. That's gonna leave a mark. Hey. Yeah. It's good timing, really. It seems, um, my bike had different ideas about me fixing its chain. - Well, you have to approach a bike with determination, otherwise, why would it let you climb aboard? - You know, you may have been a better cyclist, I mean, back in the day, but even I know you're mocking me. - I am. But maybe I can, I can show you what to do. - Be my guest. - So, you just attach the chain here, and once it's hooked, pull it through, and you're all set. There's nothing to it. For me, at least. Your steed awaits. - Much obliged. You, uh, do you wanna join me? I could, uh, we could go around the bike path. - The bike path? Yeah, the, uh, famous Brandini bike path. I could, uh, I could show you around our side. - You know, in all these years, I've never properly visited Brandini's. I'll admit, I've been curious. - Well, you let me join your class, the least I can do is give you a tour. - Okay. - Nicole is so stressed. - Yeah, Jake is too. He won't admit it, but I can tell. Yeah, those two. You see the way they look at each other? Oh, yeah. It's so obvious. - Yeah. Yeah, I, uh, I better get back to the ranch. Are you, uh, going to the concert tomorrow night? - Yeah, you bet I am. I'll see you there. - Thank you. - Yeah, take care. Come on, there's no way you could prefer pizza over a steak dinner. You haven't lived until you've tried my Chateaubriand. - Is that like a cheese steak? All right, you know what, I give up. - Well, maybe you can make it for me sometime and show me what I'm missing. - Okay, fine, as long as you bring the bread and olive oil. - Hey, um, how is your submission for the contest coming along anyway? - Uh, pretty good, I think. We've been working really hard, I learned a lot. How about you? - Oh, it's, uh, it's a masterpiece. - Do you ever wonder what it would've been like if your granddad hadn't walked away from the partnership? - Walked away? That is not how I would describe it. - What? - Raphael went behind his back and started making deals without him, how else should my grandpa have reacted? - Wait, that's what Frank says? According to my granddad, Frank wouldn't listen to reason about expanding the business, together. - No wonder you think such terrible things about me and my family. - What do you mean? No, I don't. - I heard you. The last summer you spent here, I was waiting for you by the border. - And? - And you were with your dad, so I hid. I didn't want you getting in trouble for hanging out with me. And that's when I heard you complaining about how annoying I was. - That doesn't sound right, what specifically did I say? - That you couldn't stand being around me, and you were very firm. - I think you misunderstood. I was talking about my summer tutor. - Are you sure? - Definitely. She was always giving me extra homework. I mean, who does that? That's cruel. Yeah, it is. - I never woulda said that about you, or your family. - Oh. After all this time, I can't believe I had it wrong. - And that's why you stopped coming to meet me. I never understood what I did to make you so upset. Jake. - Oh, we've been spotted. Hey, Granddad. - Nice to see you, Mr. Brandini. - Oh, hello, Nicole. - This is incredible. - Oh, personally, I think it's a little ostentatious, but my son said it would be good for the brand. - Jake was just telling me about all the gourmet meals he likes to prepare. - Oh, so you've upgraded from takeout? Uh, okay, so I don't have time to wile away in the kitchen, but I can actually make a few signature dishes. - Mm. And I was gonna bring you some of my oil. - Uh, speaking of your oil, I sampled some of the batch that Jake made in your class, you really know what you're doing. - Well, I learned from the best. - That you did. Frank should be very proud of you, you definitely inherited his gift. - That is, that's very kind of you to say. - It's true. - And on that note, I should get back to my work. - Yeah, me too, got a competition to win. Yeah, you sure about that? - Yeah, speaking of competitions, race you to the post. - All right, you're on. See you later. - You're not gonna beat me today. Not again. No, no, no, get back here. This is not fair! Mm-hmm, this one incorporates the lemon flavor. Mm, it isn't half bad. Guess I might be a real Brandini after all. Okay. - Adam, how's it going? - I think we're getting there, it's going pretty good. - Oh, well, look who it is, the famous Brandinis. - Are you enjoying the festival? I, for one, am looking forward to finally putting our reclaimed land to good use. - What are, what are you trying to say? I think, um, what he meant to say is that the Cabellas have untapped potential. - Unlike Brandini's, Cabella's not all about the bottom line. - Well, perhaps that's part of the problem. - Well, I just wanted to say I was very impressed by your accounting program. - You showed her our system? - It's just an accounting tool. - Let's go. We'll see you at the contest. - It's okay. - Have you forgotten that this contest determines Cabella's entire future? - What? No, of course not. - All I'm saying is you're starting to act like he's no longer the villain. - All I'm saying is maybe he isn't as bad as I originally thought. Hey, Adam? - Yes? - I was thinking maybe we should submit something more traditional. - You can't be serious? We finally tweaked the recipe and now you wanna start all over again? - I don't know, it could be interesting. - If you wanna wow the judges and compete with Jake, we're gonna need to present something with a modern edge. - Yes, yes, yes, you're right. Just forget I said anything, let's finalize the recipe we have. - I think that's it. Great job, guys. - Everything all right? - I don't know, you tell me. - Mm. - What do you think? - It's our signature flavor with a hint of lemon. Is that pepper I'm detecting? - Your senses do not deceive you, Granddad. You still got it. - We could win with this. - But, uh, is winning really everything? - Well, what do you mean? - I don't know, what about discovering what really makes you happy? Didn't you say you miss the good old days, when you and Frank first started the ranch? - Yeah. You ever consider making amends? - He's not interested in that. - You sure? Honeys, I'm home. - Grandpa! You're back, hey! Hey. - How was the trip, Frank? - Ah, plenty of time to recap all of that, tell me what's been going on with this border situation. - Uh, we will know in a couple days. - I'd give anything to show that Raphael who the real talent is. - He's actually been really sweet to me. Jake has been quite reasonable about everything too. - What? Did I come home to an alternate universe? I'm serious, Grandpa. Have you ever properly sat down with Raphael to hear his side of the story? - Now why on earth would he do that? - I'm afraid, my dear, Raphael and I have nothing to say to each other. - I just think it's possible we've misconstrued things. - What are you suggesting? - That the Brandinis might not be so bad. - Hey, Julie. Yeah, I've had a good visit, but I'll be back Monday. Listen, have you considered offering a settlement on the copyright case? I understand. Full steam ahead. Hi, thank you. - How you doing? Good to see you. - Hey, Nicole, there you are. Hey. Oh, I'll just take one, please, thank you. - Oh, ladies first. I'll take the next one. - You sure? - Yeah, it's fine. - Okay. - Don't be absurd. - What? - Yeah, plenty of room. - What's going on? Whoa, okay. Thank you, thank you for that. It sure is beautiful out. - Hm, Sunset Valley has its moments. It sure does. - You excited to go home? - Yeah, it'll be nice to go back to the grind, I guess. - Is there, is there someone to get back to? - Nah. To be completely honest, I'm spending so much time with my clients, I really haven't had time for anyone else. How about yourself? Pretty focused on my career too. - You're lucky. You've always known what you wanted to do. - Yeah, always, running Cabella Oil, just like my Grandpa. - And it happened. You are boss lady. Yeah, for the next few days at least. - What's that supposed to mean? - Have you already forgotten about our little wager? - No, but, I mean, even if I win, you know, you can always expand on a different part of the ranch, right? - We'd have to build from scratch, and we don't have the capital, so... - Why didn't you say anything? Come on, would it have made a difference? Plus, I wanna win or lose, fair and square. Um, I'm gonna go get us all a drink at the bar, uh, Adam, you wanna come? - You got it. Sorry. - It's okay to like her, you know? - Nicole? I do like her. - I mean, like her like her. - But she's dating Adam. She's not dating Adam. - Jake. - Oh, hey, Granddad. - Come on, let's go find a seat. - Yeah. - Here, right here. - Okay, cool. - Uh... - Hey there, how are you? - How are you? - Doing good. - Hi. - Hey. - Um, you know what, uh, can you, can you give this to Jake? I should sit with my parents. - Yeah, no problem. - Got it? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Thanks. - Thank you, thank you, thank you. All right, we're gonna slow things down a little bit now. - I think they're playing our song. - Ask the girl to dance already. - May I have this dance, Nicole? - I'm a, I'm a really bad dancer, two left feet. - That's perfect, I have two right feet. It's really easy, okay? - Okay. - Give me your hand, right here. - Okay. - And this hand goes out. Nice, wow. - Look at me. Yeah. Oh. - Well, that was quite the evening. - Yes. Yeah, it was nice. - I'm sorry, are you calling the dance that you shared with Jake nice? One song, there's nothing to it. - Nicole, come on, it's me, you don't have to pretend. I know there's something going on between you and Jake, just admit it. - Look, I mean, I am glad we cleared the air after all these years, that's all. Oh, besides, come on, he lives in San Francisco. - San Francisco's only a drive away. - You won't believe it. - What's gotten into you, son? - You have to look at the documents I just found. It could make all the difference. Stop pestering me, and let's get back to the task at hand. Tomorrow is judgment day, literally. - Fine, I'll pester you later. Okay, good luck. I'll be going into town to run some errands later. - What's this? Our final entry? - Final entry. Thank you, for everything. Cheers. - Cheers. - Sure you wanna do this? - If we wanna really win, it's the only thing to do. - I'm proud of you, Jake. - That's your winner, is it? - I hope so. - Well, you better put that somewhere safe, the Brandinis are liable to interfere. - Come on, are you saying they would sabotage the contest? That's ridiculous. - If the shoe fits. - According to this partnership agreement, October 12th, 1976. - Well, it appears you are absolutely right, Jake, and I'll take care of the construction permit this afternoon. - Thanks, Judge. - Mm-hmm. - I look forward to finally resolving this issue. - Consider it done. Well, I'll see you after the contest. - Yes, you will. - I've gotta run. - Thanks. - Okay. Oh, hello, Nicole. - Hi, Judge Monroe. - Hi. - Hi. What, uh, what's going on? - Oh, uh, you know, just taking care of some business. - Yeah, I saw you talking to Judge Monroe. - Yeah, it was just, you know, um, zoning ordinance, construction permits, that kinda thing. - Okay, and does this construction permit involve me and Cabella? - Wait, what? - Because it sure sounded like you were trying to sway Judge Monroe in your favor. - You think I would do that to you? - I know what I heard, Jake. - No, that wasn't what... You know, I guess I should've expected it, given your family history. - Please, let me explain, I took a document from my-- - No, I can't, I can't believe that I thought you were different. I defended you. - You skipped dinner. You're not still working, are you? - Not exactly, just stewing, more like. - You can stew on a full stomach, I fixed you a plate. - Thanks, but, I don't have much of an appetite. - Look, honey, I know you're nervous about the competition, but we're all so proud of you. - Thanks, Grandpa. But it's more than that, I thought that I understood a situation, but it turns out I just had it completely wrong. - I'm sorry, sweetheart, that's an awful feeling. Sometimes you just have to trust your instincts. - Well, that is the problem, my instincts seem to be way off. - When it comes to making olive oil, they're spot-on. Eat this food your mother made, get some rest, you'll feel better in the morning. Grandpa's orders. - Thanks, Grandpa. - Yeah. - Thank you. - Welcome to the Sunset Valley Olive Oil Competition. Where is she? I've been calling her all morning. - Sunset Valley treats olive oil with the utmost seriousness. We'll be selecting the winner based on a number of categories: aroma, flavor, texture, and finally, presentation. Shall we begin? Oh, and while we deliberate, please feel free to taste the samples in front of you. Wait, Judge Monroe, wait! Wait! I have to change the Cabella entry. - That's highly unconventional. - But not against the rules, she did make it in just the nick of time. - This is Cabella Sunrise. - What is she doing? - Trusting her instincts. - Here you go. Oh, sorry, here, there you are. This is Cabella Sunrise. - We got this in the bag. - I wouldn't be so sure, son. - I'm so proud of you. - Thank you. - You gonna go say hi to Jake? - There's no point. - Do they even know what you did? - It doesn't matter. - Hey, Billy, come try these. - Mm, wow. - Mm. - Oh, my, Nicole, this is, this is amazing. Thank you. - This Brandini's isn't so bad either. - Raphael, well done. - Why, uh, thank you, Frank. Your granddaughter did a wonderful job. She must've had a great teacher. - We have deliberated, and we've come to a decision. - Guys, no matter what happens, I'm going to save up and find a way to make the expansion happen, even if it takes a few extra years. - That's the Cabella spirit. And it was unanimous. Congratulations to Cabella Oil! - Yeah! - We won! We won, we won, we won! Judge Monroe. - Nicole, what are you doing here? - I am here to formalize everything now that we've won the land. - Jake didn't tell you? - Tell me what? - Oh, before the contest, he signed a declaration that the land belongs to you. - But, but why? - He found more documents that showed your border line was correct all along. - No, no, but the other day, I overheard you and Jake talking, it was something about my construction permit. - That wasn't about you, that was for Billy. - I have to go. - There's my little champion. What a day for the Cabella family. We finally got the recognition we deserve. - Grandpa, none of that matters. We keep misjudging things and jumping to conclusions when it comes to the Brandinis. They deserve for us to give them a chance. Excuse me, Grandpa, there's something I have to do. Hey, guys. - Well, all hail the conquering hero. - Yeah, uh, I don't really feel like much of a hero. - What's wrong? - Is Jake really helping you with a construction permit? - He sure is. Yeah, all your talk about expanding the ranch got me thinking, I wanna put a hotel above this restaurant. Jake offered his legal expertise no charge. - Oh, no. Have you seen him? I've phoned him a million times. - He came over here earlier, to say goodbye. Yeah, he already left. - Frank? What are you doing here? - I, uh, thought you might wanna look at these old photos with me. They're of the two of us from back in the day. - Yeah, I'd love that. - And maybe when your arm is healed, we can whip up a batch of oil together on the original press, for old times' sake. - Okay, uh, but only if you let me add my spices to the blend. - Not on your life. - You never change, do you? - Jake. Wait, you're still here? - Yeah. I know, I know, I'm not supposed to be on your property, but I just wanted to enjoy the view before I took off. I'll get outta your way. - Wait, no, I, I tried calling you. - My phone's dead. It's kinda nice actually. - I know what you did for me. Have you, have you ever met someone with a habit of making impulsive decisions? 'Cause I have that habit. I had the wrong impression about you. Well, I mean, first I had it wrong, and then I thought you weren't so bad, and I had it wrong again-- Nicole? - Yes? - Are you trying to apologize to me? - Yes. Yeah. Yes, I am. But, okay, I still don't understand why you couldn't explain to me what you were doing at the courthouse. - I was torn, you said you wanted to win or lose fair and square. - Yeah, I did want that, but you, you just let me say those awful things to you, and I feel terrible. I'm so sorry. So, you off to San Francisco? - Yep. To tell my boss I'm going to resign from the firm. - Really? - Yeah. I wanna work on the ranch. - For real? So, um, I mean, are you ready to put that acumen of yours to good use? You know it. So, uh, just a warning, you might be seeing a little more of me. - Oh, I think I'd like that. I mean, especially, especially if you wear your new boots. - I think I can agree to those terms. - Finally, a successful negotiation. - You really are something, Nicole. - I'll, uh, I'll race you to the factory. - Oh, it is on. Okay. - Get back here. No, no. You won. - Oh, yes.
