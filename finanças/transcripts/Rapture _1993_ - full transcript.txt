No. Why else would you be calling me? Oh. Well, the funeral is tomorrow. Jeff, did you hear me? I'll be there. PRIEST: God of grace and glory, we thank you for Jeffrey, who was so near and dear to us and who has now been taken from us. We pray that nothing good in this man's life will be lost but will be of benefit to the world. That all that was important to him will be respected by those who follow, and that everything in which he was great will continue to mean so much to us now that he is dead. We ask this in the name of the risen Lord. Amen. My boy? [CLEARS THROAT] My boy, I am so sorry. Oh. Would you mind? I'd like to do that. [WHIRRING] Is there anybody down there? Ahem, just the, uh, fellows who start the fire. Good. [MOTOR STOPS] [SCREAMS] Jeff, are you all right, dear? I'm fine. I'm just gonna drive around town for a while.

You call for company? You coming in? Are you a cop? What makes you think that? Well, they're no good at small talk either. [SNORTS] At least it's not my clothes. [CHUCKLES] Had to ask. I guess it would be pretty bad if you got a cop by accident. Could be. Once that hotel room door closed... you'd pretty much be at his mercy. [BOLT CLICKS] Hmm. Sounds exciting. A hundred and twenty bucks. Thanks. It's spooky in here. I like it. Take off your shoes, Georgianne. [♪♪♪] It's Lorna. You're usually a good girl, Georgianne... but all that is gonna change tonight.

I felt bad for Mike. I thought you hated me. I thought you thought I wasn't cool enough for you. [SCOFFS] You mean you would have gone out with me again? Yeah. I would have.

You feel just like you own the whole world. No, Jeff. I have to leave early tomorrow. I might not see you for a long time. I can't. I'll take you home. Must have been some party. You know, same old gang. [CHUCKLES] Till 6:00 a.m.? You must be bushed. Hey. Hey, take it easy. I got a breakfast meeting. I don't think so. [ATM BEEPING] Now it says "Incorrect Command." All you do, Ma, is withdraw cash, the amount you want, and enter. Oh. Face it, Mom, this just isn't your century. I know. Is 40 enough? No, 60's enough. Hi. Hi. This must be Bonnie. I'm Jeff. Congratulations on the Harvard scholarship. Watch out for Silent Blackstone. He is an old fake. You know Professor Blackstone? He wrote a very pretentious review of Rapture. Oh, my God. Jeff Lisker. You wrote Rapture. What's Rapture? Oh, just one of my programs. No, it's the program. It's the hottest thing on the market. What does it do? Oh, just about anything. It's-it's a game, It's a reference. It's a dream machine. I only have Rapture One. Oh, I'll make sure you get a copy of Rapture Two. No way! Well, I better let you go. Good to meet you, Bonnie. Nice meeting you. Good to see you again, Jeff. Oh, Mr. Lisker? Jeff. Jeff. Uh, I bet you could use a good home-cooked meal tonight. How about it, Mom? Bonnie-- Uh... Well, Jeff, uh, has to go back to California today. No. Not till tomorrow. Union Carbide needs another meeting. Oh. Well, uh, 6:00 tonight. Sure. Uh, 1515 Bluffside. I'll be there. Bye. [GIGGLING] This is so great, Ma. [LAUGHS] So were you and Mom an item in high school? Is that what she said? Well, no. She didn't really say anything. We were close. Oh, yeah. So you knew Mike. He was the obstacle. Hmm. [CHUCKLES] JEFF: It's a beautiful spot. Yeah. Yeah, it is. You remind me of Georgianne when she was your age. Everyone says our personalities are opposite. I meant the way you look. Oh. So are you good? Good? With computers. Heh, yeah. Yeah, I am. I drive my friends crazy because I can crack their Rapture files. Well... I bet you won't be able to crack Rapture Two. Oh, yeah? We'll see. Has Rapture... SEAN: How come you never mentioned him? I did. You just don't remember. He would have been quite a catch. He was the town hood. Motorcycle, leather jacket, the whole bit. I always thought that Lisker Future Systems was a big conglomerate. No, no. I compose all the programs, and I've got a guy who runs the business end of things and a couple of secretaries. Small staff, mega profits. Well, that's good. That's how it should be. [CHUCKLES] You know, I half expected your mom to have a high-powered career, but she seems fine without one. Well, she's got her catering business with her friend Marge. They do great parties and things, so... Probably keeps her mind off things. What do you mean? Well, you're leaving home. She's gonna miss you terribly. Did she tell you that? Sorry we took so long. Salade niçoise. Oh, my mom is the best cook in the world. Bonnie, take this bread, will you? You bet. Glass of wine? Sure. [GLASSES CLINKING] [♪♪♪] Thanks. Honey, why don't you skip the town council meeting? If I did and those new houses didn't get approved, you'd be starving by next year. Yeah, starving. I'm sure. I'll see you later. Okay. Good to meet you, Jeff. I'll walk with you. Now, are you sure you're up for this run tomorrow morning? We're still on. Great. Sean. I want you to know you have two very special, very beautiful ladies here. Good night. Next dinner's on me. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] Bye, honey. Bye, Dad. GEORGIANNE: Uh... Uh... Hmm. Don't tell me. Betty Lou Cooper. Betty Lou Cooper! [LAUGHS] It sounds like you went out with everybody, Jeff. He did, he did. Don't be cruel. "To a heart that's true." [HORN HONKS] [BOTH LAUGHING] Mom, that's Chris. I'm gonna do the dishes later. Okay? Okay. Have a good time. Okay. Thanks. Good night. God... Mmm. I went with Mike all through high school, then I met Sean. Sometimes I wish I'd been a little bit more... What? Curious. It's never too late. Yes, it is. Have you--? Bye, Mom. Bye, honey. Have you ever thought about being with anybody else? Of course. Sure. I'm married. What kind of question is that? Heh, sorry. God! Forget I said it. Yeah, okay. Okay. [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] You were so beautiful. You still are. I'm gonna get you something else to drink. I should go. Jeff... No, it's time. I should go. [♪♪♪] Is something wrong? I just want you to be happy. What? I just want you to be happy. I am happy. Good night. Good night. [JEFF WHISTLING TUNE] Are you okay? I'm right behind you. SEAN: We can pick up the pace, if you want. Or would that be too much for you? JEFF: No. Pick up the pace. SEAN: You're sure? JEFF: Yeah, I can always stop. Pick it up. Good morning, Ma. Good morning, sweetie. Jeff'll be here soon. You better get dressed. Yeah, okay, I will. Hey, is Jeff married? No. Hmm. You'd think somebody would grab him up in a second. You'd think. [JEFF BREATHING HEAVILY] Anytime you want to quit, just say so. I'm fine. Run. He seems like such a cool guy. How come he's so unhappy? What makes you say that? Hmm. I don't know. It's just a feeling. [PANTING] [RETCHES] [JEFF VOMITING] You shouldn't have pushed yourself so hard. Must've been something I ate. Maybe you ought to lay down for a while, huh? I'm okay. It's not like I had a damn heart attack. Don't worry about it. I barfed my first time out. I'm feeling pretty tired myself. What do you say we go back to the house? No. You go on. Georgie's making breakfast. Some other time. Go on... Get the hell out of here. You're sure? Yeah. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [DIANE MOANING] JEFF: Georgianne! Ow! Georgianne?! Who's Georgianne?! Oh! [BREATHING HEAVILY] Georgianne?! Is that who you were doing in Connecticut?! Georgianne?! [SOBS] Hey. No. Let go of that. No! No! Let go! Drop it! Ow! Ow! Jeffie, you hurt my arm. Let me see. No. Hey, hey, come on, let me see, let me see. Now, let Jeffie see. No, I don't wanna show Jeffie! No! Let Jeffie fix it. I don't want Jeffie to fix it! No! Yes, you do. No! [WHISPERS] I know you do. You're such a brat. [♪♪♪] [SCREAMS] Get out! [SOBBING] What, you think you can just kiss me off like that?! Well, it's not gonna be that easy! I'm warning you! I hope the bitch is worth it! [♪♪♪] Now if we can just let them to agree on point five here... Okay. Hey, Jeff, well, you're back. How was Jamaica? Very Jamaica. Well, heh, why don't you-- Why don't you sit in? We're going over the Microdex deal. No, that's okay. Mark, sit down. Ted, I'm not gonna be around for a couple of days. Oh, come on, man, you just got back. I got an idea for Rapture Three. Oh. Oh, that's wonderful. What are you gonna do? Are you gonna hole up at home? I don't know. Maybe Cuba. Cuba. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Hey, Sean. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] It's me. Jeff. What are you doing here? Just got in last night. I thought I'd surprise you. Ah. [PANTING] I see you've taken up serious running. I'm not here to run, I'm here to talk. Sure. What about? I'm very serious about Georgianne. [♪♪♪] Go on. She's just as serious about me. It's a little early in the morning for this kind of humor. Don't make this more painful than it has to be. Georgianne doesn't deserve that after all she's given you. Is this some kind of joke? [SIGHS] I'd never joke about this. I want you to see the whole picture. What picture? It's over for you. Jeff, obviously you've misunderstood Georgie somehow. Shut up! What exactly did Georgie say to you? That's between me and her. I know she cares for you, Jeff. You're old friends. But she doesn't love you, if that's what you think. What do you know about it? She's my wife! I know! I know how she responds to my touch. She remembers what it feels like to be alive. She wants to be with me. She wants to go with me. She's just afraid of hurting you. All right. All right. Let's go talk to Georgie right now, see what she has to say. You can't put her on the spot. You are really off the deep end, Jeff. Are you man enough to let her go?! You stay away from the house! You stay away from Georgianne! Put your damn house as far as you-- Back off! You can't run away from this, sport! [GROANS] God, you make me sick! [GRUNTING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] I tried to... To be reasonable. GIRL: Jack? Hey, Jack? Which way did you go? JACK: Up here! Up top. I'm trying to find the guards. [♪♪♪] GIRL: Jack, I think... [JACK SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY] It's beautiful up here! [HUMMING] I don't know what's gotten into you, but if you can bottle the secret, I'm buying. Aah. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] I don't know. I'm just feeling kind of... young lately. Marge, nothing is going on. Uh-huh. Will you tell me before you turn the cake? Sorry. Chief Galati, do you know anything about carburetors? Is your mother around? BONNIE: What is it? We need to talk to your mother. You've always had an effect on people, Georgianne. You know, sometimes I have to admit... BONNIE: Mom? ...I get a little jealous. It's beautiful. Chief Galati. What's happened? Mrs. Corcoran, it's your husband. He's out jogging. He's-- No, ma'am. He's, uh... His heart? Has he had a heart attack? No, Mrs. Corcoran. He's been killed. Killed? [SOBS] No. No. H-how? How? Where? The path behind the gorge. His skull's been fractured. [CRYING] Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh! Did he carry money? I don't know. Yeah, he-he wore a wrist wallet. Mom made him put ID in it because, uh... He might have put a few dollars in it, but... Someone killed him for a couple of dollars? What about other valuables? A watch. A-- A Rolex. It was engraved on the back. It said, "To Sean: Love, Georgie." Ho often did he go jogging? He was a serious runner. Ten miles seven days a week. So he had expensive running shoes. New? I guess. He was very particular. Someone stole his shoes? Mrs. Corcoran, uh, did your husband wear a wedding ring? Yes, of course. Oh, no... They didn't take his wedding ring? GALATI: I want you to think very carefully. Did Sean have any enemies? Enemies? Had anyone threatened him recently? I don't know. I don't know. Chief? Chief? Chief, wait a minute. Um, why did you ask if he had any enemies? Do you think it wasn't just a robbery? People get mugged, even in Hopewell. But, uh, in 90% of homicides, the parties usually knew each other. Do you think that was the case here? Bonnie, go take care of your mother, okay? [SNIFFLES] I have to know. He can't be dead over a stupid watch and sneakers. Don't protect me. Bonnie, the attack was very violent. That usually signifies an emotional connection between the victim and the perpetrator. I promise you, we're going to check out all your dad's friends, acquaintances. If we get any solid leads, we're going to take a good look. [SOFTLY] Okay? [ENGINE STARTS] [♪♪♪] Lord, our God, you are always faithful and quick to show mercy. Our brother, Sean, was suddenly and violently taken from us. Come swiftly to his aid, have mercy on him and comfort his family and friends. By the power and protection of the cross, we ask this through Christ out Lord, Amen. ALL: Amen. [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE] [♪♪♪] [LAUGHING] [WHISTLING TUNE] Ma, what was the name of that guy who tried to stop Dad from getting the permit for the house? Um, uh, Gill. That's right. Mayor Gill. He is now. Right. [KEYPAD BEEPING] What are you doing? You know, most people who are murdered are killed by someone they know. Oh, honey. You don't think the mayor killed your father? No, Ma, that's not the point. This is a way to try and figure out what really happened. I'm making a list of everyone who ever had anything against-- Honey, don't do this to yourself. Now, this will not bring your father back. Somebody has to pay for killing my dad. Someone will! Mom, I have to do this. You know? [SIGHS] [EXHALES SHARPLY] I miss him so much! [JEFF WHISTLING SOFTLY] [PHONE RINGS] Yeah? DIANE [CRYING]: Jeff? Are you there, Jeffie? I'm here. I miss you. What's wrong? Nothing is wrong, Diane. Everything is very, very right. I'm on the bed, Jeffie. I'm naked. It's over. I have no further use for juvenile whores. Jeff! Jeff! [SOBBING] Hey, uh, Georgianne? Hi, Hal. How are you? Hi. Well, I kind of feel ashamed, actually. You know, I should have called when I heard about Sean. Oh, no, that's okay. Please. Well, anyway, I got a really great offer on your parents' house. You know, I know I should have gotten something going earlier, but the way the market is today, I mean... Pfft. So, uh, Bonnie, you must be off to college soon, huh? Mm-hm, tomorrow. Tomorrow. You must be nervous. Yeah, a little. I hate to leave my mom, though. Oh, honey, I'll be all right. Well, see you later. Oh, uh, Georgianne, did Jeff Lisker look you up? Well, I saw him the night of the reunion. Oh, right, right. 'Cause he dropped by your parents' house, you know? When he was in town for his father's funeral. He was in town for his father's funeral? Well, yeah. Didn't he tell you? No, he didn't. When was the funeral? Well, it must have been just before the reunion. Well, good to see you, Hal. Oh, yeah. Thank you for the news about the house. Sure. Okay, we'll talk. [♪♪♪] Jeffrey Lisker. What are you doing? I didn't think to put his name on the list. It's pretty weird not to tell you that his father died. Oh, honey, he probably just didn't want to put a damper on the reunion. Maybe. But then he lied about why he was in town. I wonder if he really even went to Union Carbide. Better make a note to check that out. [CHOIR VOCALIZING] RECORDED VOICE [WHISPERS]: Rapture. [DIAL TONE ON LINE] [DIALING ON LINE] [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Georgie. This is Jeff. Who? Jeff. Oh, Jeff. Sorry. I-- I wasn't thinking. I'm in Hopewell, Georgie. I just heard. I wish I could've been here for you. How's Bonnie? She, um, left for Harvard yesterday. Have they caught the bastard who did it? No, they don't even have any leads. Look, Jeff, um, I can't talk right now. I understand, Georgie. Just know that I'm here for you any time, day or night. Thanks. [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] [HAMMER POUNDING] [DIANE GRUNTING] [HELICOPTER WHIRRING IN DISTANCE] [BREATHING HEAVILY] "Sean Cor-- Corcoran"? [CHUCKLES] "Architect Sean Corcoran Dead in Mugging." Huh. [♪♪♪] "Georgianne." "To Sean: Love Georgie." [SCOFFS] I know I should have called first. No, it's-- It's okay. Um... It's good to see you. Georgie, I... I'm so sorry. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] This is wonderful. Thanks. It's the, uh... raspberry vinaigrette. It complements the tomato. I see what you mean. Mmm. It's great. I've never tasted anything like it. Jeff. I have to ask you something. Um... I liked your father. Why didn't you tell me that you were here for his funeral? I don't know. Hal and I got to talking about you, and then I heard about the reunion. And when I saw you, I didn't want to start off with: "Hi, Georgie. My father just died." Bonnie called Union Carbide, and they said that they didn't have a meeting with you. Oh, yeah? Who'd she speak to? I don't know. She has a friend who works there. It's a big company, Georgianne. And frankly, it's not their policy to discuss business in progress. In fact, it would be a breach of confidentiality. Of course. [SCOFFS] I didn't think of that. Why would Bonnie check up on me? She can't accept the fact that her father was killed by a mugger... and she's made a list of people who he knew, and... What's that got to do with me? Any little thing that's off, it catches her attention. Well, I guess I can't blame her. I know what it's like to lose your father. [PHONE RINGING] Oh, excuse me a second. Hello? Georgianne? Yes. Who's this? I've got your husband's wallet. Oh, God. And his watch. It's-- It's a woman. She says she has Sean's wallet. Who is this?! Who is this? Who is this? Why are you doing this, Jeffie? [♪♪♪] Miss, I understand you've found Mr. Corcoran's wallet. [SCOFFS] She looked pretty good when she was my age, Jeffie, but she must be an old hag by now. That's not really important right now, miss. What we really need to know-- Well, what have you done? Georgianne seems very upset about the wallet. Where's Sean? [WHISPERING] Keep her talking. I'll get Galati on the phone. Maybe they can trace it. Where are you calling from, miss? [SINGSONG] What have you done, Jeffie? Get off the line right now. Oh, I thought you liked jail bait, Jeffie. She's calling the police. They'll trace the call. Oh, good. I hope they do. Diane. Diane. We can work this out. She doesn't mean anything to me. Yeah, why should I believe you? Because you know me. Yeah, well, I do know you, Jeffie. Better than anyone. Chief Galati? Yes, there's someone on the phone who's claiming to have Sean's wallet. I miss you. I miss you too. Why don't you come here as soon as you can? Hopewell, Connecticut. I'm at the Gild Inn. They're tracing it. Uh, miss, please, don't hang up. See you soon, lover. Miss, please don't-- For God sakes, don't hang-- It better be good. She hung up. Oh, no. She hung up. [SIGHS] Yeah. Yeah, okay. Damn. So close. [SIGHS] QUARTERBACK: Red 79. Down. Set. Hike. Jeff was with you when she called? GEORGIANNE: Yeah, he tried to keep her talking while the police traced the call, but she hung up. Anyway, thank God he was here. So, what are they gonna do now? They put a 24-hour tap on the phone. Listen, maybe I should come home tonight. Oh, no, honey. I'll see you on the weekend. I'll be fine until then. Jeff's been great. Okay. Well, you call me if you change your mind. Okay, I will. I love you, Mom. I love you, honey. Bye. Bye. I never imagined I'd end up in such a nightmare. Georgie... you're gonna be okay. You're strong. Sometimes I'm not so sure. [DOORBELL RINGS] Sorry to disturb you again. I need to follow up on some questions. GEORGIANNE: Of course. Come in. [DOOR CLOSES] Chief Galati, Jeffrey Lisker. Hello. Mrs. Corcoran, it is important that we speak privately. GEORGIANNE: Oh, uh... I'm sorry. Fine. I'll call you. Would you excuse me a minute? Um, sit down. Thank you so much. Well, I'm-- I'm just glad you didn't have to go through that alone. You've been great. I'll call you to-tomorrow. Okay. Okay. If it's a local call, they'll never be able to trace it. But if it's a long-distance call, they might be able to track it down in a day or two. So there's nothing new? Maybe. Maybe not. I, uh, did some checking on your Mr. Jeff Lisker. Jeff? [SCOFFS] What do you mean? You know, Bonnie's list. [SIGHS] Has she been talking to you? Bonnie's wrong about Jeff. Maybe, but, uh, the murder was June 5. It seems that, uh, there are no credit card transactions, no phone calls, nothing to place Lisker outside California between June 4th and 6th. That's what I'm trying to tell you. But June 4th to 6th, there aren't any phone calls made from Lisker's L.A. numbers, but he made dozens of calls in the days both before and after. So you're saying that he was away from home when Sean was killed. Hey, maybe he was in Bombay feeding the homeless. Who knows? Do you think Jeff killed Sean? All I'm saying is that the timing might fit, and I'm going to keep on looking. Mrs. Corcoran, is there anything between you and Jeffrey Lisker? Absolutely not. I haven't seen him for 20 years until just recently. This is insane. [SCOFFS] [SIGHS] He's a respectable businessman. That never rules out a suspect. I don't believe this. I-- Just the thought of... [SIGHS] He's been a good friend. Sometimes I think... he wants something to happen between us. Mrs. Corcoran, I have to be completely up front with you. If this leads anywhere, people are going to think the worst. They're going to say you were involved. I loved my husband. I've made sure that Jeff knows that. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON HEADPHONES] Well, it's about time. Why don't you keep me waiting a little longer? So how do you like the nails? ♪ This old world keeps-- ♪ [MUSIC STOPS] Georgianne has a lovely voice. The sneakers belong to her? Forget about her. Hey, I've changed my mind. I want you. [SQUEALS] [LAUGHS] Jeffie, I missed you so much! Yeah. She can't be as good as me. [♪♪♪] Where are we going? We are going over the waterfall. [BOTH LAUGH] Oh, Jeffie, that feels so nice. Yeah? Yeah. [GASPING] [♪♪♪] Honey, I haven't done anything to lead him on. I've told him I'm not interested. What am I supposed to do? Tell him to get lost. You just don't wanna see him again. Bonnie, I can't do that. Why not?! Do you love him? Do you want to make love to him? Don't talk to me like that. Or have you already slept with him? Look, I'm not having this conversation! Why can't you just send him away? Why are you defending him? Because he is a friend! A friend! That's all! Right now, I could use a friend. Yeah, but what if he killed Dad? Don't you say anything like that ever again. [PHONE RINGS] Hello? JEFF: Hi. It's me. Jeff. Georgie? Yes, hi. Hi. How are you, Jeff? Did I catch you at a bad time? I hope it's not too soon. Look, Jeff, um... How'd it go with the chief? Is there anything new? No, just, uh, routine questions. Can you be ready by 7:00? [SCOFFS] Ready? Yeah, I'll pick you up at 7 for dinner. No, I-- I can't tonight. I'm busy. Bonnie's home for the weekend. Well, she can take care of herself. She's a big girl. I'm 3000 miles away from home with no one to dine with. You're breaking my heart. All right, I'll... I'll see you at 7. Seven it is. Bye. I can't believe you. Bonnie... [♪♪♪] What do you mean, "not that way"? I like you as a friend. That's all. That's all? You're not married any longer. What are you talking about? Georgie, I have waited half my life-- I don't want you to wait. Don't say that. At least let me dream. You and I are not meant to be. We are. We are. What's the matter with you? Why else would I have found your picture lying in the trash?! I have to go. No. It's Bonnie, isn't it? You leave Bonnie out of this. Don't let your daughter run your life. Jeff, let me go! It's Bonnie. [♪♪♪] [CHURCH BELLS TOLLING] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] MARGE: Hi. How'd it go? [ENGINE STARTS] Hey! Home for the weekend? What, were you following me? I've been waiting for you, yeah. We have to talk. About what? [SIGHS] You want your mom to be happy, don't you? Of course I do. You know I care for her. She's met someone. You really do have quite a thing for her, don't you? Can you blame me? She hasn't really met anyone yet. Jeff, why were you waiting for me? [CHUCKLES] I thought if... If we had a chance to spend some time together... you'd feel differently about your mom and me. Hmm. What's in the basket? Oh, the usual. A loaf of bread, a jug of wine. I thought a picnic would be a good... A good way to get to know each other. Hmm. Give it a chance. [ENGINE SPUTTERS] [ENGINE STARTS] [GEARS GRIND] [ENGINE RATTLING] Come on, baby, you can do it. [♪♪♪] [GEARS GRIND] Thattagirl. [ENGINE RATTLES, SHUTS OFF] This is quite a jalopy. Sure it's gonna make it down the hill? Of course she will. She's only got a little bit of a cold. Hm. I wouldn't want to get stranded up here. Don't worry, we won't. Okay, you pick the spot. Okay. Here looks good. This is where you brought my mother. It's where I brought a lot of girls. But your mom was the only one who said no, in case you're wondering. Hmm. Do I really remind you of her? Every time I look at you. [CHUCKLES] You know, you seem like a very lonely person. You know, I never really thought about being lonely. It just sort of sneaks up on you. That's why I composed Rapture. To serve your soul. Yeah, I guess you could say that. Where I go, Rapture goes. But now... I have Georgianne. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] You'd do anything for her. Absolutely. Is there anything wrong with that? No. Mm. It's pretty good. Yeah. [SIGHS] It's getting warm. Mm-hm. [♪♪♪] You're wearing Georgianne's perfume. Oh, Georgie... Oh, Georgie... Don't you think I look more like Dad? You'd better put this back on. It's getting cold. Is something wrong? Let me see that list you made. What list? Do you believe people kill for love? Well, yeah. In-- In the heat of the moment, on impulse. You mean, they don't fly across the country and kill someone in cold blood for love? No. Not unless they're insane. Isn't love a form of insanity? I wanna see that list. What list? Right now I wanna see that list. Am I on top? Where is it? [♪♪♪] You stay away from me. Do you wanna kill me, Bonnie? Ow! [BONNIE SCREAMS] Give me the knife. Give me the damn knife! Oh, I hate you, bitch! [BOTH GRUNT] [ENGINE STARTS] [ENGINE REVVING] [DOOR CLOSES] [♪♪♪] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [CLATTERING] [SHOUTS] Oh, God, Bonnie, where have you been? Mom... Jeff tried to kill me. He left me for dead. If the car hadn't stalled, then... [COUGHING] What? What do you mean? What are you saying? He knocked me out. And then the car was all filled with smoke. He must have wanted it to look like I killed myself. Oh, my God. Oh, Mom, I know he did it. He killed my dad. I'm gonna call the police. No. I thought about that already. You can't do that. Honey, we have to. Come on, we have to. He'd know I wasn't dead and he'd destroy the evidence. What else are we gonna do? Well, there's Rapture. He said that Rapture was his soul. I'm the only one that can get into that system. Oh, honey, no. It's too dangerous. Mom, in a couple of hours, Jeff is gonna know I'm not dead. He's gonna try and erase any evidence that can possible tie him to Dad's murder. We can't let that happen. [SOBS] [PHONE RINGING] [SIGHS] [BEEPS] Yeah? [PHONE CONTINUES RINGING] Hello? GEORGIANNE: Hello, Jeff. Georgie. What is it? Jeff... something horrible has happened. What's wrong? It's Bonnie. Bonnie's killed herself. [SOBBING] Oh, Georgie... I don't know what to say. [SNIFFLES] I'm all alone now. No. No. No, you're not. I'm gonna come over right now. No, um... I'm not at home. I'm-- I'm downstairs in the Talk of the Town, in the bar. Well, come up here, suite 15. No, I don't wanna do that. I understand. I'll be right down. [♪♪♪] [SINGING INDISTINCTLY] Okay. Jeff. Oh, Georgie. Oh, Jeff. How could she do it? I can't believe it. She had everything. You need a drink. [MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY] Two cognacs. Okay, come on. [BEEPING] Come on. Access. She seemed to be... getting so much better. BONNIE: Come on. There. File system number directory one. "File number, please, Jeff." Seven. Password... Come on. I should have noticed something was wrong. Oh, Georgie. Come on. Georgie, don't torture yourself. BONNIE: Yes! There it is. "Georgie Pix." [CELL PHONE RINGING] Yeah. RECORDED VOICE: Security alert seven. Invasion of password... Somebody's in my computer. Security alert seven. Invasion of... "Georgie Aud"? Georgie Audio. [KEYS RATTLING] [GASPS] JEFF: Sean's blood smells like musk in the air. I look into his dead eyes, and a door opens into my heart. Sean's blood smells like musk in the air. What's the matter with you? Stop! I look into his dead eyes, and a door opens into my heart. Georgianne is mine. Oh, Jeff. [♪♪♪] This is it, Georgie. Georgianne, this it. You have to love me. [GASPS] You have to love me. It's our last chance. You have to love me, or we're gonna go over! [GRUNTING] Run, Mom! Leave her alone! [JEFF GRUNTING] You! You're dead, Bonnie! Mom. I love Sean. I always loved Sean! I hate you! I hate you! You and I are not meant to be. I hate you! [JEFF YELLING] [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE] [♪♪♪]
