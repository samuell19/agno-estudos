* GUNSMOKE * Well, it looks like we managed, to lose the soldiers in blue. Imagine the governor sending the army into a private war. It's his right. I'm glad to be out of Johnson County. I don't think they liked us very much. They were kind of rude, weren't they? Let's get out of here. Yah. I think we split up here, Johnny. That's where Billings goes. Are you sure don't want to go with me? No, I think I'm going to stretch it out later. What's there? Sheep. It smells like noise. We live on that, don't we? I do not know. I'm a calm guy. Yah. What about work at Billings? They didn't say. you will see that it is, to help with the harvest. It is healthy work. But be careful, not to get heat stroke. Have you ever thought about settling somewhere Johnny? Yes, once. What happened? They forgot to lock the cell one night. I'm serious. Give up thinking about the ranch, boy. Will not make it. Why not? You rented the revolver for a long time. I can forget all that. Maybe, boy. But there are many people, who will not forget. See you, Rob. Until we see each other, Johnny. Lost your horse? Do not. I was tired. I gave him a break. I'll be back later to pick you up. The same thing happened to me last week. I took a patch of mud and the horses crumbled. You may not believe it, but I had to put the 4 horses in here... and pull the stagecoach myself. I believe. He is one of the few people, who believes. Is it Billings' due diligence? Yah. That's exactly where I'm going. Get in soon. I'm late. Sorry, miss. I hope I didn't hurt you. If you get off my lap, I say. I like it here. But I do not. I didn't understand your name. I did not say. I had a little problem this morning... I believe... Haven't I seen you, somewhere before? I've been to many places. I will pull through the memory and remember. I never forget a face. I had a little problem this morning... I know, I know you... Do not. It must be!... I had a problem... A problem happened to me this morning. I had to leave my horse on the trail. If I close my eyes, you might think the horse is with you. What's the matter, don't you like horses? I don't care... I know. You are Reb Kittridge. I saw your portrait in the Cheyenne newspaper when you rented your revolver, for ranchers in war, from Johnson County. I once met a guy who got into many... trouble because he remembered many things. I'm sorry, that's why I'm an outsider. I didn't mean to offend. Me opening up thinking, I think I mistook you for someone else. Woa!... Hi Luke, I saw... It looks like something scared him. Did you have a problem, Charlie? Do not. So it must have been his way of driving that scared him. It scares anyone. Throw me the luggage. Thanks. Whatever I do with my bags, Miss. Saxon? It will be a pleasure to help. You don't learn very quickly. I just learned your name. Send the bags to the hotel, will you? Sure. Nice girl. It looks like she doesn't like you very much. She still doesn't know me well. Let her know. I still think we can deliver the cattle, Curly. Two weeks to gather the cattle and one week to take them. When do you win, Telford's promissory note? In 28 days. We have enough time, as long as... Go ahead and say it soon. Since I live so long. You know how Telford is. Yes, I know him. If it were me, I would wait for him in a dark alley one night. I don't act that way, Curly. But if something happens to me, You may come in. Hello Curly. Good afternoon. Hello Kitten. I didn't expect you before tomorrow. It was no use, staying longer. The bank will not give the loan. I didn't expect, that they would give. Is it a closed game, or can I join too? There's room for one more. I missed you. Me too, but I'll tell you later. Of course, I'm dead tired. Can we go back to the ranch tonight, dad? It seems to me that you have already traveled, enough for today. I have a special reason for that. Which is? Red Kittridge is in town. He came with the same diligence as me. I understand you. It looks like we're going to have a fight. That's why you have to stay away. That's why we have to go. I'm too old to start running. You need to hear me, dad. He's a gunslinger. You know he was called, to kill you. Please, father. Don't do this, for me. There's only one thing I wouldn't do for you, Kitten. And that's it. I built this ranch, with my hands. You were born there. Your mother died there. I faced Indians and blizzards. Droughts and floods. I will not give up, just because a gunslinger arrived in our city. Curly, don't let him go. Stay out of this, Curly. The fight is not yours. "O'SHAY'S MERCANTILE" That's what I was talking about. He's Reb Kittridge. What can I serve you? Do you reload ammunition? Oh, it depends on the caliber. I have some molds. It is a buffalo hunting weapon. Not many are seen today. Some appear from time to time. Only one man around here has such a rifle. Who is it? Curly Madder. Curly Madder!... Foreman for Dan Saxon. Does he have a daughter by any chance? Curly? He's not even married. I'm talking about Saxon. Oh sure, he has a daughter named Rita. You're going to marry Curly. It's interesting. Ah, I think you and Curly should know each other. It seems to me, that you have something in common. Yah. I look forward to meeting you. Hey, you don't want to refill just one cartridge, do you? No, I was just looking for some information. What you want to know? I already found out. Kittridg! I'm Dan Saxon. The man who hired you to kill me. And then? It can be here and now. You fool. I have nothing against you. At least so far. The stage will be out in an hour, son. Go on that stage. I just got to it. Listen to what I said. We don't like hired guns in this city. Get back on the stage. What if I don't go? Play your game now. That's up to you, "Sir". Dad!... Want to try again? I am convinced. What happened? Daddy! I'm fine, Kitten. You are very brave, but with the gun in your hand. It shouldn't be!... Curly! He could have killed you. Yah. I'm still trying to understand why he didn't. Kittridge! You're a little scared, aren't you, friend? Two already tried to kill me today. It could be the third. This is not part of my service. What you want? Telford sent me. He wants to talk to you. I'll go later. It is to go right now. When he wants, I'm here. Do you have a room for me to spend the night? Mr. Kittridge, you have a great hotel on this same street. You will like it more there. Because? We have mice here. I won't bother you. Yes sir. Room 20, room 16. First floor. It seems that I can already see, the floor is all stained with blood. What about? Very good. May it serve as a lesson. It is getting too old to face killers. He's not a killer, Doc. So he has been deceiving everyone and earning money without deserving... from Texas to the Canadian border. So why didn't he kill me this afternoon? It may not be, have good aim. His aim is very good. It seems like you like him. And why not? If someone wanted to kill me, it would be logical not to like them. He's just doing his job. You can't hate someone just for that. Hmm, under these circumstances, I would try harder. You have something in mind, Dan. What is it? I was also part of a heavy gang. 25 years ago I was just like Kittridge. If no one had not helped me, I would be in the cemetery by now. He's wild, but he's not bad. You just don't know which way it is. And you will show him. Can be. You should have had a son, Dan instead of a daughter. I'm not complaining. Let's bet the account. Double or nothing. We've been doing this for 10 years. So far I haven't received anything. Are you saying, that I cheated you? I'm just saying that I never caught you cheating. Shuffle. You may come in. Well, you're in the wrong room, aren't you? You can store your weapon. I am not dangerous. It could even be. You have the right equipment. What about the gun? Ah!... I feel half naked without her. You are really half naked, with her. I did not expect visits. You're not going to ask me, why did I come here? No, I think you will end up telling me. I'm not in a hurry. How did you become a hired gunman? I myself think that I have a talent for that. You have to have good reasons to become a hit man. I still haven't murdered anyone. But the time will come, that you will have to murder, right? Look, if you're trying to reform me, you're wasting your time. What does someone like you want from life? I also want to have my own ranch. I am no different from the others. I'm working on it, the only way I know how. My father wanted that too. Only he got it working. Now you're helping Telford get him out. It is a risk he has to take. If it weren't for me, it would be someone else. I could have killed him just now. Why didn't you? I have nothing against him. So why did you accept this job? I haven't accepted it yet. That's not what Telford has been saying out there. Telford is assuming many things. So will you refuse, the job? Do not. Suppose I make a better offer. What? A job on our ranch. $ 40 a month. With 10 hours a day in the saddle? Food made in the wagon? Cold blankets? Hmm, that's part of it. And the rest? It seems to me that you are in a position to demand what you want. Maybe I will do that. I know, I could make things nice for you. If you really think so, maybe we can reach an agreement. But the way things are, I think I would lose in the end. I am not a deadbeat. I doubt it. Ah, don't you dare. Put me on the floor now. Look here, Miss. Saxon. In my way I am honest. But I cannot say the same about you. Now get the hell out of here. One day I hope to meet you when you can't use your right arm, sir. Kittridge. What is going to be? Whiskey. It is to drink, or to throw at someone. In fact, it is to light the fire. We have that type too. Listen, I saw a guy take two sips of this thing and... go out to hunt bears with a slingshot. And what did he need the slingshot for? Are you traveling under another name, or don't you know an old friend anymore? In this business, today's friends may not be tomorrow's friends. Better to change business. That's what I'm thinking of doing. How about a drink? I'll pay you one up there. Sure. Is this temporary, or are you already the owner? I'm still working on it. Tell me when to stop. When wetting your fingertips. The last time I saw you was in Denver. Why did you leave there? And why did you leave? I had a reason. You had 12 reasons each with a gun in your hand. I heard you left Wyoming too. Yah. You have quite a file. Texas, Arizona, New Mexico. Colorado and now Wyoming. I'm still young. But it is running out of states. There is still a lot of room in Canada. Luck. Something I always need. Have you seen Johnny Lake? Yes, two years ago. He's not in town, is he? No, he went north. You can write to him using the remaining bin Sandy post. He's still in love with you, Cora. He has always been, my second option. But I didn't invite you to talk about Johnny. I have a proposal, to make you, Reb. What do you think about owning a salon? This salon is from Telford, isn't it? She said... Yes, just like all the ranches in the valley, except one. I don't see how you do, get into it. I could get married if I wanted to. And then, what would happen? I thought you could imagine it for yourself. I thought I was tough. But next to you I am an asshole. I told you. I always get what I want, however I need it. You may come in. Ah, it's you, Matt. Have you met Red Kittridge? This is Matt Telford. I haven't had the pleasure yet. Some whiskey, Cora. I don't have much patience, sir. Kittridge. I sent you out hours ago, that I wanted to talk to you. I don't like to wait. So we are tied. I don't like taking orders. Me, I watched your little altercation this afternoon. A lot of people watched. It seems that I was the only one, who didn't know this was going to happen. I tried very hard to announce your arrival. I already knew what was going to be, Mr. Saxon. Too bad you missed the opportunity to kill him in self-defense. He drew it first. You should have told me, what was going to happen. You received my letter. The letter said almost nothing. Certain things, mr. Kittridge, better said than written. It's very simple. Mr. Saxon owns a ranch, which I want. Why don't you buy from him? Good question. He doesn't want to sell. What do you have to gain by killing him? I have a promissory note from him that expires in thirty days. It is not impossible to take cattle to an eastern market in such a short time. So why are you worried? He won a contract to sell meat to railway workers. I want to make sure that the meat is not delivered. You don't have to shoot him for that. And why not. I just thought it would simplify things. I'm sorry to disappoint you. But that's okay, sir. Kittridge. I am sure you will find another way to prevent delivery. How will it be? The details are up to you. He was highly recommended, as an expert in his field. Oh, was it? Who recommended me? An old friend of yours. Cora Duffrayne. Thanks for indication. Not so. I always try to help old friends. How much is your service? $ 500 now and $ 1500 when the job is done. It's too little. I think I am paying very well. But I can do it, a counter proposal. I do all the work and you keep the ranch. What do you think of being partners in this endeavor? What is your idea of partnership? I accept a third. Ah, ah!... I'm not in a hurry. Think better. Your friend is difficult to deal with. I told you it would be very expensive. More expensive than I thought. Why don't you pay what he wants? Two thirds is better than nothing. You did not understand. If I give him a third now, he will want everything later. What are you going to do now? I will be able to wait until tomorrow and make a better offer. Kittridge! Looking for noise, or is this the only room in town? I'm safe here. Telford was not going to try anything against me, in his own establishment. It isn't, Matt. Here is my business, I like to manage it peacefully. That's why he sent for you, son. You are drawing hasty conclusions. I'm? I'll buy you a drink, sir. Kittridge. Sure. This is Curly Matther. my foreman. Dr. Farrel. How are you? What is your name again? Curly Mather. I thought so. I have a proposal to make you. Your daughter already made me one. And it has more to offer than you do. Sit down, Curly. I heard about the visit, that my daughter made you. My proposal is, a little better. It doesn't hurt to listen. I understand you're interested in owning a ranch. I may have said that. What do you think of my ranch, Square S? As it seems to me, there are more people wanting him. Let's bet. You can cut the deck. The highest card stays with the ranch. Including the mortgage? This is the part I want to get rid of. It doesn't seem like a good deal. All you have to do is deliver the cattle. What if I lose? Then it will work for me. $ 40 a month and food For how long? As long as I find it necessary. One moment, sir. Kittridge. If I understand correctly, he is working for me. If you understood correctly, you did not accept my price. Go ahead. Don't be silly, son. He never loses in the cards. So it's time to lose. You can cut the deck, Matt. So that everything is honest. Do you think he's honest? Honest, no, but clumsy. You first. It seems to me that you are now in the cattle business. I will take my cattle to the market. And I'll be damned if anyone tries to stop me. The next time you shoot someone, collect the empty cartridges. Another thing. Leave your horse out there. You owe me one. I arrived late, but it looks like someone outwitted you. I underestimated, mr. Kittridge. Aren't you going to do anything about it? Sometimes you have to accept defeat. You give up easily, don't you? Saxon was one thing. Kittridge is another. He has a reputation for being violent. He worked for that. I know someone, who is not afraid of him. You know a lot of people. It's worth getting to know the right people. How soon can your friend come? 4, 5, or 6 days. You can send for him. It's ok. But this time, I don't want you to save money. Until your horse is not bad, Curly. Take him to the corral for me. I'm not your employee. If you're not my employee, get off my ranch. You are very brave, with a gun in your belt. I wanted to see if it is, even a macho man without her. You will never know that, Curly. Because I will never walk without it. Ah, hello son. Sit down. I'm just cleaning up. Sometimes I find it silly to learn to read and write. You could avoid all this work. Here's the ranch title. You can register when you go to the city again. And... here the copy, of the Telford mortgage. Well, the paperwork is done. Want some information? Yes. Where's the cattle? It is there in the hills. Wasn't it collected in the spring? With the winter, we didn't even have to. The lands gave nothing. Winter killed the pasture and also a lot of cattle. That is why Telford was able to buy almost all the ranches. And if it weren't for the contract, he would also have this on the road. The remaining cattle may be scattered from here to Canada. This is. The title expires in 28 days. That's not news. If it is too far away, it is time to collect the cattle. The problem is yours. Yeah, it looks like I ended up losing out on the deal. When you want to undo the deal, just let me know. I'll take the ranch back. Thanks. I think I'll take a chance. This time, at least. Have you ever worked on a ranch? I know how to get by but I never ran a ranch like that. You will need help. I didn't even think to try it alone. If your men agree, I'll stay with them. They know the region. What about Curly? What about him? Well, he knows how to deal with men and cattle. Only the two of you are not really friends. As long as I don't improve my aim, I don't care if you're my enemy. Wait, I make a point of explaining son. I didn't know, that he was going to set up an ambush. It was just his thing. He has a vivid imagination. Look at it from his angle. The ranch was going to be his one day. He's going to marry Rita. I'll get in there too. Do you already have a plan? What are you going to do? At my age, we don't make plans anymore. Just let the boat run. Since that's how it is, let's make a deal. I'm all ears. I need a lot of help. Logically you are the one who knows this property best. Are you offering me a job? Why not? You did the same to me. I will think about it. I have no hurry. I'm not going to start work until tomorrow. Want to show me the ranch? It will be a pleasure, son. Maybe I can never see him again. What is that? Your cook, the teacher. Well, if you guarantee. These are your pawns. I believe that mr. Saxon explained to you. I'm the new owner, Kittridge. Yah, we already know. Do you want to know, where are things at? Well, I'm going to run the ranch like mr. Saxon drove. Your place is there, if you want. None of us will stay. We just want to get our back wages. Right. Pay the men. I think the responsibility is yours. You are the new owner. And I'm broken. You didn't tell me about back wages. You did not ask. Good... I think that little by little I am learning to run a ranch. While learning, how do we get our money? You have two paths, Curly, get your things and get out of here now, or stay here until you can receive. We don't work on credit. Because I think, they will have to work. We have to take the cattle to the market. You help me and I will pay double. What guarantee do we have to receive? My word. That is not enough. Why isn't it enough? I accepted. Are you going to work for him? We have to eat, don't we? I prefer to go hungry! I've been there and I don't advise. Is this serious, Dan, or is it also part of the bet? It's really serious. This ranch has been mine for 25 years. I lost it in an honest game. I would do anything but kill, not to hand him over to Telford. What do you say? What works for you, Dan, works for me. Yah... also for me. Thanks. Tomorrow we are going to start collecting cattle. Curly? I will accompany you, Dan. You wanted to see the ranch. Who is it? Me, Johnny. Just a moment. I can enter? It is better, otherwise it will be a long distance conversation. I will not leave. Hey, Milt! Bring a pot of coffee. Didn't you like to see me? I don't like to see anyone this morning. Feel free. I'll comb my hair. I must be horrible. You're fine with me. You have been in the hills for a long time without seeing a woman. Would you like to get coffee. Well come and take it. How's it going with Kilttridge? I can take it or leave it. On second thought, I'm going to take his hand away. Why are you working for him? You know very well why. I guess, but it's still good to hear again. Curly! What happened? You do not have what to do? There are still some cows on the hills. Then start looking. See you later. One day he still breaks his face. Curly? Yes, Curly and I want to be there to see. They don't seem so bad considering winter. They put on weight when they find good pasture. Tomorrow they will be, everyone in this pasture. Get ready to leave the day after tomorrow. Where are we going? There is only one way. Through the valley, surrounding the mountain. It would be closer to cut across the mountain. Closer, but it is a path that no one has yet tried. At least they didn't, on the other side. I believe in you. You know the region better than I do. Solve it yourself. Time is important to you. And Telford can try anything. I don't think he tries. Don't underestimate him, son. If he takes this ranch he will control the entire valley. And land is scarce. You won't give up like that. It's up to you to get up!... Hey, I?ve never seen anything more beautiful, since the day I turned 12 in a dice game. Stand up! Stand up. I will break your face. What do you hear, Curly? We were looking, Dona Rita. Calm. Well, it's well worth it. Hey, wait a minute! It's your little one. If you don't want them to look at her, stay home. One day you will serve against me and I will not let you change your mind. Look at the buoy. Come on, let me play for the pigs. Come on, go get the food. Well, what do we have today? The same as yesterday, Beans and horse meat. Eat horse, come on. But the teacher could take the harness off. Hey boss! What's up, professor? Mr. Saxon said, that we leave early tomorrow. Yes, early tomorrow. And what do you want to eat during the trip? As well. Is there food shortage? No, not missing, not missing. It's over at once. What do you need? Well, let?s see. Potato, flour, salt, corn flour, Ah, lard... Make a list. Eh!... A cart must go to, the city today. And what do I have with that? You are the one leading. Have your breakfast and harness the horses. Well, there they are, guys. Let's blow up the troop. Assemble! Fast! Go forward and make them come back. Ah! we managed to stop them. But they are scattered... Who got hurt. Fraser. It's serious? He won't be riding a horse anytime soon. Was it Telford? If it is to name the oxen, I say yes. He better get back to the ranch. I will send Dr. Farrell over there. As soon as dawn, start gathering the cattle. Why don't you give up? It will take a week to put them together. I want the troops ready, to leave the day after tomorrow. Whoa, whoa!... Ah, it's you. Don't say you were worried and came looking for me. What about groceries? There are no groceries. Telford closed, his credit at the warehouse. Go around and find me, in the city. Kittridge is coming. Mr. Kittridge! Unexpected pleasure. Oh yes? Did you think I didn't come looking for you? Excuse me. I have no idea what you're talking about. You know what I'm talking about. Get your men off my ranch, or you just end up in the back of the sun. I don't like threats. I'm not threatening. I just try to save your life. Ah, the quiet guy. Johnny! How are you, Red? I thought you were raising sheep in the north. Those men treat, employees worse than dogs. Afterwards, I couldn't take the smell. Ah, the gentlemen already know each other. We?ve known each other for some time. I am told you are a rancher now. Yah. Want a job? Thank you, I already have one. It was good to come here, Kittridge. Now I can make you a proposal for the ranch, that will give you a good profit. It is not for sale. You are making a mistake. I already made some. It may be interesting to know that the ranch is not legally yours. What do you mean? There is a territorial law... which prohibits land ownership won in games of chance. You're lying. Now, read it yourself. Why didn't you tell me before? I did not know that. Mr. Bratton, discovered this today. It looks like Red, with the donkeys in the water. If the ranch doesn't belong to me, why do you want to buy it? Let's say I'm offering a bonus, so that the title goes back to the former owner. Take the money, Red and make it easy for both of us. I don't want to exchange shots, with you. The choice is yours, Johnny. Wait. I'll buy you a drink. Why not? Interesting situation. Need help? Stay quiet. A friend of yours? Helpers. Very friendly. That's what I like about this job. The company. Sit Reb. I'll get the drinks. You got the wrong bottle. This one can even drink. It's from Telford stock. The bar's whiskey is good for cleaning boots. When is he paying you for the service? $ 3,500. He's raising the price. He only offered me another $ 2,000. You have to take into consideration, the type of service. How are you going to pay? 1,000 in cash and $ 2,500 when the job is done. When to kill me? I think your name was mentioned. Well, at least they already shot me. Can I sit down? There's always room for one more. Like old times. The three of us together. Yes. Only the funeral director is missing. It would be a happy meeting. How does it feel to be a rancher? Very good, so far. See you later, Johnny. It seems so. Johnny! Yah? Do you think you'll have to kill him? I do not know. Take the cart behind the warehouse. I meet you there. O'Shay? I want to talk to you. Let's go. I prefer to stay here. I don't think you heard it. I said let's go. You are bluffing. You wouldn't shoot me here. If you think it's a bluff, keep sitting there. Kittridge just left with O'Shay. Send Johnny up here. It's good this way. Take a pencil to write it down. I'll pay later. I can help? Yah, help upload here. This is a robbery. No, it's not. I'm just opening an account. Something more? No I think that is enough. Take the cart to the road and wait for me. I won't be long. Listen, Kittridge... I already said I will pay. Take the revolver. Oh, no, don't kill him here. I don't want to get involved in murder. He robbed the warehouse, didn't he? Calm. Nobody is going to kill anyone. As well? He is my friend. But Telford said... Telford just doesn't want the cattle to be delivered. Well then? I like to see cows running. Like tonight. What are you going to do with it? Give him a beating. So he'll settle down for a few days. I have nothing to do, thereby. Get out. Why did you refuse Telford's offer? It would be better for both of us. It looks like it's enough. Come on. It's hurting a lot? Enough not to forget, who did it. Where did you learn to do this? Living on a ranch, we have to learn everything. I think I should thank you, for getting me out of there. It is not necessary. Why did you help me? To see how you do, act without your right arm. Then you gave Dad a job. I think I should be grateful for that. I thought you did that, for me. You needed help. I've needed it before, but I haven't received it from anyone. Do you love Curly? He wants to marry me. But that is not what I asked. I don't know why you're so interested. I don't want to bid on merchandise that already has an owner. We'd better go. Hyah, hyah!... Hyah!... Hyah, hyah!... Hyah!... Hyah, hyah!... Hyah!... It took two days to gather, the cattle we spread. Today, very early, they were already on their way. It's already 8 or 10 miles, it's worth it. Do you think they could be in Yellowtone in a week? It doesn't seem impossible. As they go, I think it will. It is better to take a peek. It will be the biggest barbecue ever seen in Montana. Just don't tell anyone that you helped to bake. And am I wanting to be hanged? It is good not to facilitate. Come on! How far do you think we went today? About 15 miles. Well, let's walk a little more. We still have 2 hours of sunshine. We have been on the road since dawn. Cowboys need to rest and sleep. Why don't we camp here? They can go down when we get to Yellowstone. On my way. One thing you need to learn. You can only trust a man to a certain extent. You have an arm, in a sling. Let me worry about that. I'm just trying to warn you. I'll go ahead and choose a place to camp. They set fire across the valley. And come towards us! I was wondering, what Telford would do. Let's cross the river. Let's go to the river. Make that cart turn around. Hey come on, hyah!... Hyah!... Come on, woa!... Hyah!... Hyah, wow!... Whoa!... Hyah!... Hyah, come on!... Better now? Yah. Thanks. Couldn't it have been done alone? I think I could. Because? Let him do it then. Do you want to give me orders? I've been looking at you both and I didn't like what I saw. So it's better not to look. Are you enjoying Kittridge? I'm not liking anyone. Not even from you. It seems to me that you lost, the little one, Curly. Ah!... I don't know what you think, but tomorrow I'm going to get out. It looked like the payment was going to go out, now everything went downhill. Your money goes out, Curly. Put the cattle, to walk early tomorrow. And where will we take it? To Yellowstone. The cattle will not be able to cross, the burning. All suffocated will die. I don't intend to try. We go through the mountains. I know the region and that is impossible. Have you tried? Do not. So it will be, a new experience. I will not. Well, get out. I'll go when I'm ready. You go now. I think I have a right to choose. You will only choose how you want to go. On horseback or feet together. You?ve been thinking, you?re the one since you got here. I think it's about time someone ended this pose. When you want. I don't pull a gun for one-armed men. Forget the sling, Curly. If someone else thinks that they can't climb the mountain, it?s better to go now. I always thought that high altitudes are very healthy. That bad was good, that Curly did not accept the challenge. Curly doesn't worry me. So why are you practicing. I told Telford that I would kill him if he messed with me again. This will not save the ranch. But it will take half of his pleasure. Look, you are not the first, who misses something. Dad lost the ranch to you at the turn of a letter and didn't complain. I just said I was out of luck. I think. Yah!... He had a wild card in the deck. I don't understand what you mean. He thinks he's going to get the ranch back after I sort it out. This is a lie. Why don't you ask him? Dad never cheated on the bets. His daughter told me, the same thing once. Hyah, hyah!... Hyah!... Hyah, come on!... Come on!... Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Ride that cart. Harry! Basie! Force! Put this thing on, to go up. Do you want me to take it apart and take it up and down? Take a rope. Let's give him a hand. Hyah!... Get that thing out of there. Why didn't I drop this before I started? You don't like working anymore for Saxon? Come on hard!... If that's how I think, it may be. Continue! There is a law at this end of the world that prohibits the possession of land won in games. Not this one! So he's been bluffing all this time. And if he's not, I'll buy you a round. Get ready. Right. Hyah, hyah!... Go on, hyah!... Hyah!... Hyah, hyah!... Hyah, hyah!... We will reach the top of the hill today. How will it be on the other side? It can't be much worse. We have already passed places that even goats would find difficult to pass. Well, come on. Let's move on. Well, it looks like he'll be on time, right? I always thought it could arrive. And what are we going to do? Don't worry, Kitten. In the end, everything will work out. Hyah!... Why are you telling me all this? I thought it worked, for Kittridge. I was working with him until two days ago. And you said goodbye for good reasons. They were good for me. Ah, ah!... Do you know the region, Curly? What are the chances of taking the cattle up the mountain? It's pretty tough, but it's possible. If possible, he will. So I suggest that you take action. I was afraid I was going to say something like that. Do you mind if I go along? Yah it does. I like those who shoot in the face. You need a guide, Johnny. You hire men. I just say what I think. Hyah, hyah!... Hyah, come on!... Fund, no? Yah. It will be hard to pass, the cart over there, professor. I once saw a guy try. Yes and what happened? Who knows? He was never seen again. Well, this will help. Teacher! Let's get on with it. Are you thinking, that I'm going to guide this over there? Go ahead, there's no danger. Look here boss. Without sleeping, I don't mind. Wild animals and rattlesnakes also do not. But then to commit suicide I say goodbye. What do you want to do? You can't drive, the one-armed wagon. You can break your neck. The neck is mine. Give me the reins. Hyah!... Gosh! Is afraid? Never let me do that again. I thought you were gone. Maybe you need me. What are you talking about? I saw Curly and the Telford gang coming through the canyon a few hours ago. Curly wasted no time, already turned the jacket. If they scare the cattle, we can't contain it here. There is a throat, with no exit a little higher. Put the cattle there. I have a good idea. Come on, professor. Hyah, hyah!... Hyah, hyah!... Take the cattle well, deep down. Teacher, get on those rocks and make a fire. What do you want a fire for? They are armed. You heard. Let's go! Hyah!... Don't forget that there are only an outlet. Where we enter I know. That's why we came here. This is the last one, boss. Put more wood on the fire. I don't know if I got to say it. The gang has about 25 men. I heard. They're coming. They're already close by. They will be surprised when they get here. You two get on those rocks over there. It's like shooting a barrel. Too bad, he was so your friend. Come on, let's go in. Daddy! Are you badly hurt? Do not bother yourself. Deliver the herd of cattle to the camp. I will get there. The meat is coming. Is there a doctor here? There's one here, who calls himself a doctor. On the other side of the tracks. Thank you very much. You better go take care of your father. I'll be back in a little while. Oh!... Here's mr. Kittridge. I think our accounts will check. I accept your bills. I don't even know how many there were. Is it too serious doctor? It is superficial. In a few days it will be fine. Well, son, your problems are over. They may be starting. I wanted a ranch. Owning something always brings problems. It is the responsibility that is assumed. I'm not sure if I'm an owner. There is time to go to Billings and pay the promissory note. I didn't mean that. I think there is a law in that territory, that you cannot win land in games. Yeah, I heard about it. And what are you going to do now? The law was made for drunks and idiots. I am neither. Did I answer your question? In part. It's all right? Okay, thanks doctor. What's the other part? You could have won when we played for the ranch. Could. Why didn't you win? It is difficult to explain son. I thought I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. I've never been much, with Curly's face. But there was no one else to compete. It's because I? I didn't choose it. I just put the merchandise in the window, so that everyone could see it. You have a good ranch now son and a good girl. Now it's time to hang up the gun and get to work. I still have this account, to settle. This account, it is better to leave it like this. Not the way you're thinking, but my head is at a premium. With one arm, he will accept the challenge. What would you do? The same as you, but I still think, that you are heated. Thanks. What is this? This is its title, in case I stretch my shins. What do I say to Rita? I'll be back. Get out of town, Johnny. He'll come looking for you. Do you want me to run away? Yes. It's already a change, isn't it? The point is that there is nowhere to go. If he's looking for me, I don't even want to go to sleep... every night thinking, "this is where he gets me today". Reb! Stay where you are, Johnny. Are you looking for someone? Telford. I want to settle an account. Leave the money with me. I give it to him. I want to pay in person. Don't forget that I still work for Telford. He doesn't want to see you. I thought he would like it. Don't try, boy, not with one hand. You?re still worth $ 2,500, for me I hit you before I reach the bottom of the stairs. I make things easy for you. This is good. He didn't want to pay me the bonus. Certain people can no longer be trusted. I pay a drink, for everyone. And just say the poison. If not, we do. We're even, Johnny. Good to hear that, Reb. I don't like to shoot friends. Someone is looking for you. Come on, let's get out of here. You arrived soon, didn't you? If you have time, can register that title. We will be busy. Everything went well, as you wanted. I am satisfied. Doctor, whoever loses, pays. Don't worry, I'll pay. "THE END"
