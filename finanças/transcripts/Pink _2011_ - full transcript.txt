PINK Sang-guk! Did you call? Yes. The room smells musty. It hasn't been used for long. Open the bar at 3. I don't have many customers. Go on, eat. I can't help you much. I got other things to do. Are you Sang-guk? We're not opened yet. Could you watch my guitar? Sorry? Do you take eggs from that fridge? That's right. You should too. You know, Sang-guk thinks these eggs will become seagulls. So he keeps them in it. Do as I say. Stop being a fool! Alcohol is the best remedy! Yes, getting drunk makes you get over things. You're hammered. So, you have any place to go? I'm going to leave town. Have a drink. Cheers. It could be our last night here. Hey, who is that lady? She is new here. - When did she arrive? - A couple days ago. You're one of the earliest to get news. Hey, have a drink. Let's have a drink together. Sit down. Sorry. What's with her? I'm not gonna eat her. Hey, just have a drink. The pretty lady is shy. Shy? Let's go. I'd like to join you but I have customers. Would you like to put your bag down? Alright. Enjoy your meal. - One more soju, here. - Yes. STOP THE DEMOLITIONS Hey, have some snack. That sounds good. You're the best. Bring it to me. I need some alcohol. How long have you been staying here? I don't know. A hundred days? Still no change. Where's Sang-guk? He ate dinner and went home. Aren't you tired? I'm okay. Sang-guk. Jesus! What's the matter this time? Alright, don't go to school. Do as you like. Let's change your clothes. Come on.

Now it's your turn. You are doing great. Don't do that. I said stop. Don't. I prepared the dishes. Just serve them. Yes. Hey, sis! Are you in? What are you doing here? Stop doing these chores. What's the use? Listen to me! I told you. Move to a decent house with the compensation. Aren't you sick of this town? Shut up! What do you know? I'll never leave this town. Who says about leaving? You're just moving aside. You can't change anything. Shut up. It's not. Sang-guk! You spoiled brats. Get out of here! What the fuck! Let's go guys. Why do you keep cleaning up empty houses? Those houses are like my garden. I can't let my town being deserted. We've protested for a hundred days, right? That's right. A hundred days, and still no changes. - We should do something. - Do what? Get real! We have nothing but the clothes on our backs. You're right. I don't believe them. I'm not going anywhere. Yeah, me too! How can we trust them? Then what can you do? I don't want to leave. But all the houses will be pulled down. Are you okay? Are you ill? I'm on a period. Is it serious? Let's go inside. You'll be alright? The streets were lined with cart bars. The fresh sea cucumber and a cup of soju! I miss that. All those delicious slices of rare fish! - You mean raw fish? - Yeah, right. And a cup of soju! That was so good! I miss that lady from Seocheon. - You know her very well. - Don't even go there. - Why? - I should say... - You liked her the most. - Yeah, that's right! You're the one who made a move. That's not true! I'm still single. Did you sleep with her? Remember? The sunset was so beautiful. Back then, we had so much beautiful things. You married? I don't think so. I'm not, either. Let me guess your age. You were born in the year of the Horse, right? If you are, we are the same age. I guess you are from another city. I was born here, what about you? Are you alright? Say 'eh'. Longer. Yes, there it is. It's deep. Open your mouth. Alright, I got it. Do you want to see? I have to check again. Give me the reeler. Open your mouth. Lift your chin. Lift your chin, please. Open your mouth. I have to check to see it's all out. Higher, please. Say 'eh'. Say 'eh', not 'ah'. It's all out. We will put some water in. Get on the bus, mister! Hey, let me go! Be careful with that! Handle with care! - Get on the bus, please. - OK, I will. - I'm not going anywhere. - Come on! - No way, I'm not going. - Please! You got a visitor. My boy, your hair got much longer. You want mommy's milk? OK, good boy. What do you think? Hey... Pink... Is this Pink? This is not Pink. What the fuck! Sorry to keep you waiting. Su-jin... Later... Sang-guk? What are you doing here? Your mom is not here. Go home and wait there. What happened to your hair? You had a perm? Let's go. Hey! Why are you still here? I told you! Your mom is not here. Go home and wait there. Understand? Did you pee here? Huh? Oh, Jesus. Go home! Go home, now! What the... Hey! Stop right there! Sang-guk! Where are you going? So you're the new Pink? Looks a lot better than the old Pink. Here, have a beer. Where's Ok-ryun? You didn't know? She participated in a sit-in and got arrested. A sit-in? To protest against the demolition. It would've been so hard for them. I wish they get a fair compensation. Life is harsh. Let's drink. If drinking solves the problem, I'll drink every day.
