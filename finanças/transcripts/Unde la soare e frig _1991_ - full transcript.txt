Not again! Stop it! A COLD PLACE IN THE SUN starring: make-up: sound: editor: set designer: music: executive producer: photography: produced, written and directed by Bogdan Dumitrescu Dreyer Are you going to Constanta City? Yes. Just wait a bit. Are you from Constanta? No. Could you take me to the railway station? Yes, but we'll make another halt first. Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Idiot! How do I get to Constanta? - Did you come with this car? - Yes. Well... wait by the road. Another car might pass by. How far is the highway? - You mean the asphalt? - Yes. 20 miles. Thanks. You can wait here, in the shade. Thanks. Are you up there? Can you hear me? Yes I can. I haven't seen any car passing by. I must get to the railway station. What shall I do? Well, I can't help you. Just wait... I've seen a motorcycle here. Is it yours? That motorcycle... It's got a flat tire and I can't fix it. Sorry. It's been like that for a long time. Do you have a phone then? Only a transmitter. I can't use it as a phone. If you wait by the road, a car might pass by. I'm sorry, there's no way I can help you. So, how's it going? You're going to sleep in that room. Here's the key. I've left you something to eat, too. Good night. Good night. Good morning! Did you eat? Yes. Good morning. Did you see any car? No. Don't worry! It's all right. One has fallen down the stairs! Never mind... I'll go get it. But it's gone all the stairs down! Happens to me, too. I'll be back right away. Was it white or black? This is my treasure! Look! How long has this lighthouse been here? Well, for about 100 years. They built it here because this is a magnetic area. When the ships get here, their compasses go haywire. This equipment is new. You should have seen the old one. There was an acetylene lamp, with six wicks, right at the heart of it. The whole equipment floated in a mercury container, about two tones of it, for stability. The beacon was rotated by a clock mechanism set in motion by weights. Who broke the window? A swan did. - A swan? - Yes, a swan... - Here? - One night... It was flying towards the light and hit the window. It fell down, over there. I ran down, but I couldn't catch it. It recovered, and flew away. Look, here was the clock mechanism, instead of the engine. The weights were pulled by the chain. They were set in motion by a crank every six hours. And what about that ship? It's a wreck. It's been here for a long time. They didn't see the alarm light. When ships get into this area and see the red light, they know they've entered the dangerous zone and might get stuck. That's what happened to this one. It got stuck because they didn't see the alarm light in time. Or didn't want to see it. And what about this light bulb? That's it: the alarm light. This small bulb? I have one like this at home. If I put my hand here... ...all the ships could...? Yes. ... 54, 55, 56... Hallo! You're on the step 56! - The wind started blowing! - Yes. Blowing from the south today. Man, you've got some heavy traffic around here! Still sunny. But cold. Look, round that corner, there's a beach with all sorts of weird things. - What kind of things? - Things the sea brings... ... from the ships. Why should it leave them right there? Don't know. Just leaves them there. It brings me shells. Once, I was with Gianni, a fisherman. We were looking at the sea. Suddenly, about 50 or 100 yards away, we saw something struggling, coming to the shore. I couldn't make out what it was. When it come closer, I could see there were two dolphins. One of them was coming towards us very fast. The other was jumping round it, pushing. It was like a fight between them. It kept pushing, and striking its muzzle. I started laughing, cause I thought it was... ... some old scuffle of theirs, ... or that they were mating. But Gianni pulled my hand and said: ''Don't laugh...'' ''...that dolphin you see there coming to the shore...'' ''...wants to kill itself. And the other won't let it.'' I watched them for a while, then I saw them swimming back. Do you know how far these things can be heard from? What are you doing here? Let me teach you how to play. - But it's cold out here! - Come on! No, sit this way, it's better! Look, there are five draughts here, and two there, and another five here, right? Do you want the white or the black ones? Ok, the white ones. I play this way, and you play that way. Do you get it? There once was a student who lived in a wooden house. Just above him lived a general. What's this? Some kind of a joke? The general would go out playing cards and come back late at night, always at the same time. He would walk up the wooden stairs to his place, sit down, take off his boots and go to bed. The student had got used to waiting every night till the general came home, so he could go to sleep, too. The general's boots were bumping, ''Bump! Bump! Bump!'' up the stairs, Then the door creaked when he went into the room, four steps to the bed, he sat down and took of his boots. ''Bump!'' went the first boot, ''Bump!'' went the second. And only then the student knew that he could go to bed and sleep. Always the same thing night after night. And so, many nights passed by till one night... The general comes home as usual. ''Bump! Bump! Bump!'' up the stairs, opens the door, the same four steps to the bed, ''Bump!'' the first boot... I don't know what the hell to do with this! And...? I'll see to it tomorrow morning. I'll do it by hand now. - You're going to stay here all night? - Yes. It's characteristics don't really matter now. What matters is to keep it working! What are you doing here? I was thinking about changing the oil. Changing the oil? - Let me show you something. - What? Come here, you'll see! - What do you want to show me? - You'll see. Listen, do you know where swans go in winter? Swans? Stay here! I want you to see this. What? Don't move. Hold your head like that. No, the other way. Sorry! - That's Ok. - Sorry! Where do all this things come from? From pirates' ships that attack streamers at night and sink them. That's strange! I haven't seen any boat since I came here. Listen. Have you been on that wreck? - Have you been there? - Yes. When I was a child. I want to see it. There's nothing to see. Just some empty cabins. I used to play there. I want to see it! Okay. Let's ask Gianni for his boat. What shall we give him instead? Give him what? Would he need this? Come on! - How do I look? - Perfect! Yes. This is Gianni. First it was him... ... and then came the sea! I've brought you a guest. - Welcome! - I'm hungry. Let's eat some fish. We are leaving! Come on! We're going! When I was a child, I'd swim all the way here, and stay in the sun all day long. Look how small the lighthouse seems! There's nothing to see here. Let's go! Hello! Are you an astronaut? No, I'm a compass. Do you know this? Do you like it? A guy came here... I think he was looking for you. He was looking for a girl. I thought... it might be you. I didn't know what to say. He didn't even mention his name. He seemed nervous. Was he driving a white car? Yes, he was. He said he had been looking for you for two days. I said that you had left but might come back. Then he left this phone number for you to call him tonight. Tonight, 'cause tomorrow he's leaving. I don't know if it was the right thing to do. You did the right thing. Not telling him that you are here? I can't get used to going up these stairs. 206. Yes? That's Constanta over there? Yes. 206... 206 multiplied by 2... ...412. If you go up twice a day, six days a week... You don't do it on Sundays, right? ...6 multiplied by 412... I go up whenever necessary. Come on! Well, are you coming? I must fill up. I'm going to buy a sandwich. All right. 200? Do you want some? No, thanks. Let's go! - Here's a telephone. - Stop please. Do you have some coins? Here they are. Thanks. Hallo! ''Albatros Hotel''. Just a minute. It's for you! For me? Hallo, is that you? I'm in Constanta, calling from a phone booth. I can't hear you. Speak louder! Why are you looking for me? No, I'm not alone. I said I'm not alone. There's someone with me. What are you talking about? No, don't come here! Tell me where you are. The phone works awfully. I could hardly hear anything. I have to go and talk to him. I couldn't understand a word. - Can I give you a lift? - No need. He told me he's somewhere nearby. It's easier to get by foot. Wait for me here for half an hour, all right? Okay. Stay there! So? There's a coffee house over there. Let's eat something. Wait a minute! Let's call a friend of mine to pick us up. - What for? - It's raining! - I have my motorcycle! - Are you kidding? Come on! - Get in! - And what to do next? Hallo, Silvia? You recognized me? Well, I'm in Constanta now. It's pouring out here and I don't know where to stay over night. I'm in a phone booth, opposite the Casino. Yes? All right. Thanks a lot. I'm waiting for you. I think she's here. Come on! Come on! Get in quick! I must go to see my mother a few days. So you can stay in my flat even longer. It's only for tonight. Thank you. As you wish. No problem. It's warm. That's fine. I'm going to dry up. Go and see if there's any food in the fridge. All right. I found nothing but wine. There wasn't anything else. Never mind. So let's have a glass of wine. Cheers! Maybe I can find something. Listen... This guy who looked for me at the lighthouse... He said he'd wait until tomorrow to take me back by car. Here's some marmalade! So? What are you going to do? I'm going to get a tea-spoon. You are wet. - Yes? - Sorry, the wrong floor, I think. Who's there? Sorry. It must be the wrong flat. Who are you looking for? I'm looking for... somebody. I'm looking for... ...a girl. I'm sorry. Hey you! You!
