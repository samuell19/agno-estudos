What? - Just, don't be too disappointed when I flop. - That's the thing, babe, even when you do flop you still keep going anyways. I know. - Oh by the way, if you don't sell everything in the yard sale, dad's planning on giving you some money so don't worry about it. Hey, when's this from? - That's last summer. It's a great picture of you two. It's a copy, we have the originals. - Sure, I'll put it on my fridge. Oh shit, the spaghetti! Oh fuck, it's all mushy now.

You ever have one of those? - Well now that Mercury is out of retrograde and Jupiter's aligned with Mars, I mean come on. Let's go for it, right? - Right. - And then when Dawn said that she had somebody she wanted me to meet that, I might really like, , I um, pulled out the calendar and whoa, it was Flag Day. It's about being proud of who you are. - Proud of your country, sure, but, you know, standing up for yourself and saying yes. I want love, I want freedom, you know? - Just noticed your tattoo. It's pretty awesome. Miss Pac Man, I've never seen that before. No, it's not Miss Pac Man. - Oh. - Um, it's an ancient symbol of a fish. - Oh. - Mm-hm, it uh means time before time. Love before hate. Something like that. - Sounds about right. - I should probably just tell you now what eventually is gonna come up later. - Um, well, we're not allowed to talk about it in my family. But, my Grandpa was in the Nazi youth. - Uh, oh, okay. - He wasn't in it for very long, only a couple years, and then he moved to France. - I, I don't really know what to say, um. I'm feeling kind of nauseous and my stomach is just like-- Something else we'd have in common. I just didn't want any secrets between us, you know? - I have to go home. Um. - Okay. - I need uh, I need to make some watermelon slices. - Oh, okay, take your time, I mean, I really do think we could have some fun though. - See you later. - Um-hm, it'll be a lot of fun just to spend the day out in nature. - Right. - Hey. - Jessica! - Hey. - Hi! - Uh. - There's extra pasta if you want some. - Oh no thanks, I'm not hungry. - Hey Jess, Jamie said it's still cool for me to come over after she moves. - Awesome, Spaghetti Thursdays.

I know some people you should meet. - I will, thank you. - You know, you should just audition for this, now that you're already here.

You are so fucking selfish! - I'm sorry, what do you want me to do? - You just do this all the time. - You wouldn't even have been there if I hadn't asked you to come and support me. You just, everything just comes so fucking easy for you. Jess, Jess. Go, go hump a camel! Damn it. Hey, do you need help? - Yeah, someone took my wheel. People suck, who does that? It's raining. Sorry, do you need help? - No, I walked today. Can you leave it here and then just come back for it? - I don't want them to take the rest of it. I'm going about two miles that way. - Well, I'll go with you. I was going to Andersonville anyway, we'll take turns. - Yeah, come on. My god. What? Bad day. It's kind of like a wheelbarrow-- - I know. - you have to angle it. There, okay, got it. - That must be kind of great, getting to be on the stage, you know, to be someone else. Yeah, but I'm always me, you know? Like no matter who I play. Sometimes I wish I could just totally become someone else, you know, and have their voice. Oh yeah, like Meryl Streep. - No, no, no, no, no, I mean, I could never be her. Like, like scientific stuff, you know? Like, instead of having lines from, from Mamet or Wasserstein, I could be thinking about like, microbes and protons. Do you want me to switch? - Well, yeah, here I'm gonna put it down. Go for it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, here, done. - Oh god, here, thank you. Well, you know, you don't have to be good at just one thing. - You're right, I could fail equally at many things. - Seriously, I couldn't do what you do. - Yeah, you kind of keep us sane. You're basically a mental health worker. - Um, well, I, believe it or not, I used to want to write mystery novels. And then I went into my family's snack business. Come on. - Little Bobbie. Oh my god are you for serious, I love Little Bobbie! With the, the, let me get that. With the, with the, with the, with the swirly thingies and the the caramel star, um, cake things? - Yep. - That's hot. - Yeah, well I hated it. And then I didn't really like being around my family, so I went into computer engineering. - Aa-ah. Do you have a lot of bad lighting there? Is that the one with the talking dog and the old guy baby? Yeah. It's like there's all these shows with old fat dads, you know? - Well, that's why they need the talking dog and the old guy baby. - Well maybe you can explain it to me sometime. - This is me.

What're you doin'? - I was gonna send you this, but you may as well have it now. I feel like a hooker. - You're my friend, moving to an expensive city. Come on, this is easy for me. - That's like a month's rent. - It's what I make in a day, just take it. You're gonna miss me. - Don't rub it in. - That's not what you said a minute ago. - I wish I could take you with me. And Jessie, and Katrina, George, my sister, and the lake. - And your women. You've got the best of both worlds. What worlds? - Well, you have booty calls whenever you want them and you have the wife at home, cooking, cleaning, and doing your laundry. - We share the laundry. - So you're the only one who hasn't noticed? - How Jess looks at you. Like what? - Like so. Ohh. - Oh, that looks good on you. - Whatever, it's good you're leaving. I don't know how much more of this I could take. - You're not exactly single.

She made it? - Yeah. - It's great. - Yeah, she should have been here by now, actually. I'll give her five bucks for it. - How about I set it aside for you, and when she gets here I'll let her know you want it. That sound good? Yeah. - Good. - Good luck. - Thanks. Uh-- - Come on in, come on in, you don't have to stand out there. - Thanks, sorry. Ah, Jamie said that she left a hoodie of mine over here? It's a black, it's kinda long, have you? - Oh, I haven't seen it but you're welcome to come in and look around if you want. - Cool, cool yeah, thank you. Oh. Wow. - You have a lot of cameras. - Oh, yeah, well I started collecting them when I was a kid. - Cool. - This one's my favorite. Why? - It was one my dad gave me. You know why they call it Kodak? - 'Cause when you press the button it makes that sound. Kodak, Kodak. - Yeah, yeah, it sounds like when you say it. My Mom had a camera when I was, when I was little, and it would like talk at you and it would say like, too dark, too dark, when it was too dark. But it wasn't clicking it was an automated, you know, accented, yeah. - You're a lot funnier than Jamie is. - Thanks. I'm, I'm sorry, am I interrupting something? - No, no no, I was just having a drink, do you want one? - Sure. - All right. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah that's, whiskey's fantastic.

Cool. - Sorry, I'm just weird about the sweatshirt. It's probably not even here. You know, you just lend something to Jamie and then you think you're gonna get it back maybe at some point, but then she gives it to someone else and then you see them wearing it and that's just, it's strange. - Yeah, I have the same problem with my jewelry. She like takes it, doesn't ask, never get it back. - You still have some on. - Oh this, well, I never take this off, so she'd basically have to like, take it off while I was sleeping. Which would be creepy. - Yeah, oh yeah that would be pretty creepy. This is good. - Yeah, I uh, I didn't make it so I can't take credit for it but I, I poured it-- - I have, yeah. In the wintertime. - That's intense. - Yeah, it's fun. Tastes better when you work for it, ya know? - Is that like the liquor version of hunting or something? I never thought about it that way. You're so weird. - Okay. I feel like I should tell you something, but I don't want this to come off the wrong way she, Jamie's not really good at keeping in touch with people. You know? Why are you telling me that? - I mean, I don't know, just, thought you should know. - Are you talking about like when she goes to New York? Like whether she's gonna call me or not? - I mean, I don't know what she's gonna do, I'm not saying that. - I mean it doesn't really matter, we don't, it's not like we've made any promises to each other or anything. - Okay. - Yeah. You worried about that? - Mm-Uh. Yes you are. - No, I'm not. You like her don't you? - No. - Yeah you do, you like her a lot. - You need to shut up. - You definitely don't like me very much, do you? - I'm done. It's a camera. See, Kodak, Kodak. - You are so weird. - Um, the glasses. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh, we don't have to stop. This is awkward. ♫ I could come down ♫ To your love ♫ And I could live longer than you thought ♫ And then you'd never have to leave me ♫ And you would never have to deceive me ♫ Oh I could come down ♫ I went to your show ♫ To see the actors ♫ Though I'll never know ♫ How much they suffer ♫ 'Cause it's only shining stars ♫ On stage with bleeding hearts - All right, here you go, have a good one. - I just put Judith Butler in the kids' section. I am freaking out. - Oh it's like Jess is acting weird. - Well, she blew me off at my yard sale, now she won't answer calls. - It sounds like she's sad, not mad, for you abandoning her. - I'm not abandoning her, she's not my girlfriend. - Ah, coulda fooled me. She acts like she's in love with you. - You know you're not the first person to tell me that this week? - Oh, here she comes. Hey. - Thank you. Oh my god, falafel. Thank you, I am so hungry right now. Hey Jess, I need to talk to you. - Um, I wanna talk to you too, but I have to go to work. I'll see you at the party? Bye Katrina. - Bye. She looks good walking away. - It's really sweet of you throwing this party for Jamie, George. - Going away parties are so more important than birthdays or weddings, that's what I say. - You know, I'm going to be leaving too one day. - No, it's all right. Here, cheese nib, aw, pop. - Mm, those things are good. - I know, it's right there, it's good. Who's that sexy thing? I haven't seen her before. Hey, you might get lucky tonight. Hey. Hey, how you doin'? Ah, this is my sister. - Hi, I'm Monica. - Hi, Rhonda, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Rhonda's a good friend. - Yeah. - Good. - Good. I'm gonna go get a drink. Hey. - I didn't know you were gonna be here. - Clock's ticking. - Have a cheese nib. - Everyone, everyone. A toast. - Yes, okay, even though you are my younger sister, and a complete pain in the ass. And you narcked on me every chance you could to dad, I couldn't have asked for a better sister. I'm proud of you, Jamie. - Here, here. - Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay. The bookstore is gonna miss her, and I'm gonna miss you especially even more because I'm not gonna be able to play D and D all the time on the computer! But seriously, enjoy New York, I'm gonna miss you. - Cheers. - Cheers. To Jamie! To Jamie! - My darling roommate, a fabulously talented actress and an even better fuck, huh? What? I know you know. You know Jamie, Chicago is going to miss you, but I'll survive. - Jess, you're drunk. Did you eat anything? You care? - God, don't be so mean. I'm the nice one, Jamie. Who got you into that Improv for Pinter class, huh? And who helped you with all your algebra tests, negative plus negative equals positive, Jamie. - Yeah, that was you, Jess but-- - Yeah, and when you had to sell your eggs, who put all the hormone shots in your butt? And who got you lime popsicles every night because you were feeling really shitty? Those were made out of real limes. - Thanks a lot, I'm leaving. - No, no, no, no, Jamie! This is your party, hm? Hm, go, have fun. I'm gonna go home, to my house. And I'm gonna watch a show. Whatever. - Jess come on, we love you too. - Yeah, okay. Jamie, we're gonna have a good time. A good time, you know, with your friends. Jamie, Jamie. - Jamie. - It's your party. Fortunately, there is still alcohol. So drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink. All right, cups up. Whoo! - To Jamie and Jessie.

Let's go. Hey. - Hey. How you feeling'? - Better-ish. - Yeah. Mm, this is good. Want some? - Mmm. I don't make it as good as you though. - Got to put the peanut butter on first, then the butter then the jam. - So much for low carb. - It's a cougar. - Stripes and spots. - Yeah. - Then answer it. - Hi.

God, it was beautiful today. - Yeah it was. - You got some sun. - It's worth it. - Your hair's all wet. - That happens when you go swimming. - Yeah. Come here. You make me feel like John Cougar Mellencamp. - Like what, Jack and Diane or, or Little Pink Houses or something? - I don't know. Um, I've, I've got to home. I gotta wake up early. Is that okay? - Yeah, yeah, it's fine. Here I'll, I'll take these two, okay? - Okay. - It's hemp milk, it's good. - I wish you wouldn't do that. - That tastes like sidewalk chalk. - Yum. - Spider, spider! - Oh, shit. - Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. - Go, go, go, go. - My hero. Is this my underwear? Yeah. Ah-ah. ♫ Come on baby just light my fire ♫ Come on baby just light my fire ♫ Come on baby just light my fire ♫ Come on baby tonight ♫ Come on baby just light my fire ♫ Come on baby just light ♫ Come on baby just light my fire ♫ Come on baby tonight ♫ Come on baby just light my fire ♫ Come on baby just light ♫ Come on baby just light my fire ♫ Come on baby tonight ♫ Come on baby ♫ Come on baby - Hi.

Come on. Step into my office. So what's going on with Jamie? - I messed up. We slept together a few days ago. Oh my god. - Yeah. - No way, are you like-- - Well, and then I slept with her lover. How did that even happen? - I know. I-I-I-I-I went over there and I said that I lo, that Jamie had taken my hoodie, that she had left over at Rhonda's. - Oh that's not good. - I know that. - Okay, I can't believe that Rhonda did that either. - Yeah, afterwards she said that we um, were probably just doing it so that we could get closer to Jamie. - Yeah. - Yikes. - Thanks. Which is so funny because she's not even my type, you know? - Whatever that means. Oh my god, does Jamie know? - Oh god, I don't know, I mean I haven't told her. Um, I don't know if Rhonda has. I was gonna tell her right away, you know, to just kind of like get back at her and stuff like that-- - This is really good. - Come on, for that audition thing, are you kidding? - Well I-I-I-I didn't really have fully think this all out, okay? - Okay. - I felt better for like 48 minutes afterwards. Because she's leaving in like three days. I mean, are you still gonna still tell her that you're in love with her, or? - I don't know. I'm all smooshed up, Dawn. - Okay, let me ask you a question. Do you dream about Jamie? Sometimes. - Okay, in these dreams what are you guys doing? - Stupid stuff, like you know, doing laundry or watching TV or-- - Okay, okay, and this new girl, Elizabeth. How do you feel when you're with her? - Kind of shy. You know, nervous, excited. Yeah, but without the goopy eye things. - I mean, do you feel like, eager to touch her and just to be near her? - Yeah. - Do you like, feel your shit drawn to her like a magnet? Geez Dawn, yeah, yeah. - Talking's good. You know, she, she, she gets my jokes. Time goes by quickly. - Do you think about Elizabeth when you pull espresso? Like, her eyes and her mouth? - Yeah. - Okay. One last question. Okay, pretend Jamie asks you to be with her, as a lover. And asks you to go to New York with her. What would you do? Take your time. - I wouldn't go. Why not? - 'Cause I don't want to follow her around anymore. 'Cause I'm not in love with her. I mean, I think I was, but I'm not anymore. Are you sure? - I mean, she knows me better than anybody. And, and I would do anything for her and I love her and, and I don't ever want her to forget about me but, I'm not in love with her. Holy shit, Dawn, I am like, I'm, I-I-I, okay, I kinda have bad self esteem and I'm kinda this neurotic mess, but, I am not in love with Jamie. Yeah, okay cool, I'm, I'm gonna go. Okay, I have-- - Okay. I mean I have to talk to her about, stuff. - Yeah. Thank you. - Yeah, you are welcome. - I'm not in love. Hey. - Hey. - Streetcar Named Desire just came on. - That's interesting, how bout something a little, I don't know, less depressing? - Sure. - It uh, it makes me sad that we haven't been getting along lately. - Yeah. - And um, I was talking to Rhonda. - Well I mean, she's not my Rhonda but you know. You know Rhonda. - I know two Rhondas. There's a Rhonda that lives down the street and then there's your Rhonda. - Well, the Rhonda that we both know. - Your Rhonda, so you're talking about your Rhonda. Okay, yeah? So, what? - Well, I was just um, I was talking to her and she said, I was telling her I'm gonna miss you. - I'm, I'm gonna miss you too. - An, and uh, I mean-- - Well, you know how important you are to me, right? I'm gonna call you like ten times a day. - Of course, and I'll probably do that too, but? And um-- - Well, hopefully Elizabeth knows how to handle you. - I think she does. - Well then. - Well I... - Can we just watch animals eat each other? I'll rub your feet. Yay, yay, yeah? - Yeah, yes, yes. - Give me your feet please, thank you. Oopsies. Look at his head. It's huge. I mean, I think it's a he. - In two days I'm gonna be in Brooklyn, eating a real bagel. - Yeah, you won't have sky like this though. - I'll have stars though.
