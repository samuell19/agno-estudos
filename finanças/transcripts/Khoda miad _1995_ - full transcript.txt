Hello, I hope you're fine. Thanks. Can I help you? Excuse me, but I wanted to see Mohsen. Mohsen! Come here, my boy. Is there anything? No, thanks. Sorry for disturbing you, bye. I've brought your mother home from the clinic. She must have an operation. I'm going to the city to borrow some money from someone. Take care of your sister Massumeh. Listen to whatever Grandma says. I've given some money to Mr. Ghassem, the grocer. I told him to set aside some milk everyday. I've cut some wood, take it inside after school. Mohsen! Don't forget to get the milk every morning. The doctor said your mother must drink milk. Well, I've got to go. Go back to the class. Father! Can I go duck-hunting? If it doesn't make you tired, go. No, it won't make me tired. Take this in. The doctor said I must have an operation. The operation will be very expensive. God knows what this is. Don't worry. Don't lose heart. God is great. Only the devil is desperate, God is the Healer. Have faith in God. Call me whenever you need any help. Pray to God and ask God to cure my daughter-in-law. I hope she'll get well. When will Mr. Majid come back? I don't know. I didn't want him to go. He's shy. I told him who get you so much money? He said, "Don't think about it. God is great." "Everything will be O.K. if God wills." God is great, He will cure you. Put your faith in God. Massumeh, darling! When did you come? Where's Mohsen? Mohsen is stacking the wood. We've got to go. May God protect you. Don't hesitate to call us if you need any help. God cure you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Grandma, I put the wood in a stack. Well done, my boy! May God keep you safe from harm. Mohsen! Won't you come duck-hunting? You go! I'll come later. Hello! Hello darling! Are you fine? Thanks. Do you want to go out? Father allowed me to go hunting. Can I? What about your homework? You haven't even eaten lunch. I'll take a few pastries and do my homework afterwards. It's cold. You might catch a cold. I'll wear boots. We've got enough till your father returns. I'll sell it and bring the money. O.K., go. He's an ardent boy. He's just like his father. Let the ducks go. There are no ducks today. God knows best, one day he gives, the other he doesn't. Eat! It's good for you. Eat a few spoonfuls. Thanks. You need strength. Won't you? No, thanks. - Mohsen! Did you eat your rice? - Yes. - Want any more? - No. Go and bring some wood. Praise be to Mohammad and his progeny. God! Save her. We've got no one else but you. Massumeh! Have you done your homework? Come! Take the wool. Sweetheart, don't be upset. Mother will get well soon. You're my beauty. Grandma! Can God do everything? Yes, my girl. Everything is in his hands. Can he cure my mother? If God deems advisable, your mother will get well. What does advisable mean? If it's proper, if it's appropriate. What does appropriate mean? It means when the time comes. When will the time come? When you don't tell lies. Say your prayers. Particularly you, children, when you pray. Your mother will get very well. - Grandma! Where is God? - God is everywhere, my girl. He can see and hear everything. If we say something to ourselves, will he hear? Yes, my girl. You pray for sick people, your mother will also get well. - Hello. - Hello, you've got a letter. - I hope it's good news. - Thanks, bye. 1st graders, copy the books. 2nd graders, do your math. - Where are you going? - Shopping. - Can I come too? - No, go home. - Hello. - Hi, Mohsen. How are you? What do you want? - Letter. - A letter. Why do you want it? - To write a letter. - Letter. Oh, paper and envelope? - Yes. - What do you want to do? - I want to write a letter. - For your father? Well, he'll come back soon. Why are you upset? O.K. I'll give you them. You're a good boy. You go to school, don't you? Study a lot. May you become an engineer or a doctor. Here's your paper. Do you want stamps? And here is the stamp. Put the paper in the envelope, stick the stamp. Drop it in the mailbox. It'll find its way. Bye. What are you doing? Come in and close the door. - What are you writing? - A letter. For whom? Won't you tell anyone? - No. - Sure? - For God. - For God? How? I'll write a letter. Stick a stamp. I'll bring it to that road and drop it in the mailbox... ...and it will go to God. What do you write in the letter? Hello God! My name's Mohsen. My sister's is Massumeh. Our mother is very ill. She must go to the hospital, so the doctors will cure her. But they want a lot of money. My father has gone to a city, hoping to bring a lot of money. But if he can't find enough money, my mother won't get well. Everybody said that God can solve all problems... ...and God always cures ill people. Now, Massumeh and I are writing a letter for you... ...to come and take our mother to the hospital. You're very kind. You love children and we love you. If you don't come, we will get so upset and we will cry. We know no one else who can help us but you. We will wait for you in the road of the village everyday... ...so that you will send someone... ...who will come by car to take our mother to the hospital. This was our letter to you. Here! It's here! Oh Abul-Fazl! Oh Fatemeh Zahra! What's wrong, my child? Oh Fatemeh Zahra! Oh Abul-Fazl! Help us! Oh God! We've got no one. Help us, God! Oh Abul-Fazl! Help us! What's wrong, my child? God! Help us. Oh Fatemeh Zahra! Mohsen! Go and tell Mrs. Belgheis to come here. Take this medicine, my girl. Mrs. Belgheis! Mrs. Belgheis! My mother - my mother is very ill. Let's go, my boy! Don't be unhappy, my girl, your mother will get well. You too. Mother will get well. Everything will be alright. You shouldn't be unhappy either. Trust in God. I hope God will repay you. May God prolong your life. You who help everyone. Now, we must pray to God, to make her feel better. By the five Holy ones, I hope she gets well. Why don't you sleep? I don't feel sleepy. When will father come back? I don't know. Mohsen, do you think God has a house in the sky? - Yes. - Where do you think? On the moon. How will the letter get there? It's far away. It's even further than the forests. Grandma said "God can do everything." Do you think that God will read our letter? - Yes. - What will happen next? God will come. - Light the fire for Grandma. - Come back soon. - Hello. - Hello. I've got eggs. Eggs. Twelve tomans each. Eggs. - How are you? - Fine, thanks. - Postal flowers! - I saw some too. What are these flowers doing here? - I found it at last. - What is it? A letter without any address. Just two names, with a childish handwriting - Mohsen and Massumeh. They probably wanted to play games. What should I do with it? The envelope is open. Perhaps the address is inside. What's the matter? Why are you upset? I don't know what has made Miss Derakhshan so upset. Miss Derakhshan! What's the matter? What's the matter? She was reading a letter, suddenly she started crying. - Please take her to my office. - Alright. Don't be so upset. Do you want something? Mr. Poorseifi, would you please read it out loud? Thanks. Please go back to work. I'll tell you if anything happens. To be honest, up to now... ...I had never felt the presence of God so clearly... ...and I didn't know, God is so close to us. So close that he can show his grandeur... ...in a few sentences written by two children. Our colleagues have decided to find the kid's address. And they want to pay all the hospital's expenses. I envy all of you. They're coming. They're coming. They're coming. Translator: Dina Forouzin
