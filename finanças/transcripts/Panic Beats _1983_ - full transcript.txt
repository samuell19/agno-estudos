No, Alaric, no! Forgive me Unfaithful bitch! You must die But simple death is too good for you Her lungs are fine The problem is something else The last tests were not good Paul... Your wife is not well Her heart has become weakened And getting worse every day I'm afraid it's serious What can I do? Get her out of the city She needs rest and fresh air And to relax I'll give her a strict routine that she must follow Will it cure her? I'm afraid not. It's very serious But if she takes care of herself, she could live for many years - It's down to you - Yes, I know what I must do She's my number one priority now I couldn't live without her Indeed You still have that house near Perrouze? Yes, I almost had to sell it The last remains of the Marnac estate My family's final resting place Now, of course, I don't need the money Me, once a poor architect... marrying one of the richest women in the country Remember how they behaved at the wedding? Like I was an ignorant peasant A fortune seeker Paul, you have to move on, forget about them Really... You think it's that easy? You've done well for yourself, made a lot of money Everyone respects you, you know that Stop tormenting yourself Now listen... That house is ideal for your wife It's quiet there, the air is clean It's in the mountains, but not too far above sea level She might not like it, it's not exactly luxurious there But it would be good for her Try to convince her I will, but she never went there before I always had to go alone To check the state of the place occasionally, that sort of thing Don't worry, we'll think up some way of getting her there Paul... Pierre says you need peace and quiet He suggests my holiday home So I get to see that place at last We'll leave tomorrow. Soon you'll forget all about Paris Very good, Mr Marnac, sir. Whatever you say... What a face that guy has Not what you'd call handsome Sort of mean looking Auntie, those old stories about him, are they true? Of course they are Your grandmother herself saw those weapons dripping with blood Blood stains that stay fresh for 500 years? Hard to believe The legend says Alaric de Marnac slew his wife and 3 of her 5 children - Only the two he spared were his - What a monster Then he took to witchcraft and devil worship Finally he went mad He committed many horrid crimes He even drank human blood And his disciples did as he commanded Finally he was brought to trial and the king ordered him imprisoned There was a huge battle Alaric was killed by his wife's brother with an arrow through his heart He was damned then to eternal torment - Just an old wives tale - Why? Really auntie, it's too ridiculous What's so terrible about her having a lover? I'm not trying to excuse him but he found her in another man's arms So? If every man killed his wife because their marriage wasn't working, where would we be? And that beast killed children No matter whose they were, they were innocent kids He died in mortal sin His soul can never find peace People must have been really dumb back then Enough talk There's a lot of work to do upstairs Come on! Don't you give me that look I'm not your wife! Tonight we'll be in Perrouze I'm happy, Genevieve At last you'll see my holiday home I have such happy memories of childhood days there Memories I want to share with you Mabile's great. She's been like a mother to me I know you'll like her Genevieve, my love, I know you'll get better here We can walk in the woods, visit the sights We'll be really happy here Paul, as long as you're here, that's all that matters - Is this him? — Yes, that's right Not bad looking - What's he like now? - Like that picture It says 1965 He looks about 30 I'm good at ages So he's getting on now You know... He looks a bit like that man in the painting I hope he's not such a beast Look, I brought you here to help me, not to gossip all day All right! Keep your hair on Get to work I want everything gleaming I'm glad the house will finally be lived in Mabile wrote and asked if her niece could move in with her She's a young girl with no other family We can use some help around the place I'm glad I agreed to come I feel we're going to be very happy here I wish I'd come before Don't worry, we'll make up for lost time Now I'm starting to see how shallow my life was in the city Surrounded by false friends only there for my money, not for me It was all so superficial - This is our new life - But for how long? We'll work it out together Now what's up? I think we're out of gas What a disaster. What can we do? There's a town not far back, I'll get some there I'll come No, it's too far for you Can't we wait? A car might come by Not many come this way It's the scenic route That's why I chose this road, damn it! Don't leave me here I won't be long Relax Don't worry Put the radio on. Just close your eyes and relax You'll be fine, see you soon So his wife's really ill? Heart problems. She's coming here to rest She'll stay here when he goes to Paris on business Then we'll have to look after her Great! Not just servants but nurses too Listen, we have to do what we're paid to do Maybe I was better off in that school in Toulouse... That school was a jail Now you're my responsibility I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you Think before you speak You're just like your mother, God rest her Tell me about her She was my sister, but totally different from me Auntie, I promise I'll try to be good Really I know, Julie. Deep down you're a good girl Don't you dare move Get out Just behave and you'll be fine Get the luggage out Are you mad, stopping out here? This place is like the jungle Survival of the fittest Come on lady We only want to see if you've got anything worth having You're rich and we're poor We're just trying to even out the odds Shit! Let's go This way, come on Paul! Be careful I'm worried They should be here by now It's very late Midnight... Listen to that wind All through the house The sort of night when Alaric de Marnac rises from his tomb There's someone... downstairs at the servant's door Who could it be? Who else? Obviously the master. He's here He finally arrived. Come on I'm so glad to see you at last What happened? - We had an incident - An incident? I had to go to the police in town Police? Mabile, don't worry. It's all sorted now And your wife? In the car. Waiting with the luggage This is my niece, Julie Pleased to meet you, Julie Me too, sir Let's go I really like Mabile, I know we'll get along great She'll take really good care of you, you'll Her niece is a pretty girl But I didn't like her Give her a chance, we only just met her I know, but there was something about her I didn't like Something deep down inside her Mabile has her faults too - Like what? - She tells stories Horror stories of ghosts and monsters Used to give me nightmares when I was a kid Lots of them were about this ancestor of mine Sounds like that book Rebecca. Do you remember it? Except Mabile is a good housekeeper In the book, the monster was a beautiful woman Here it's the ghost of a knight who turns up every now and then - I never saw him, of course - Who was he? Alaric de Marnac, the man in the painting He looks like you Hardly surprising, since we are related Mabile used to scare me with him He has a satanic look It's chilling, it freezes the soul Nothing like you, thank God! Well, let's talk about happier things I have no problems with old legends What happened earlier was real I thought those thugs were going to kill us It was horrible Darling, I'm here to protect you Yes, I know And as long as you are, I won't worry Julie, calm down, it's me, Paul You were screaming I had a terrible nightmare That man in the painting came to life He tried to kill me I heard a scream and came to see what it was I know, I heard it too I dreamed about that picture It's your horror stories Well... good night Goodnight. I'm sorry, sir Good night It's wonderful Julie, every day I feel better A month since we came and it seems like yesterday How time has flown by I'm glad you feel better I feel stronger every day And I'll tell you a secret I'm falling in love with my husband all over again Mabile is nice, of course, but do you know what? I didn't like you at first Now I feel really close to you I didn't like you either I hope you do now Of course I do. I'm really glad we met Dear Pierre... I am happy to say that Genevieve is getting better The clean air, slow pace of life, it really seems to be good for her Every day she gets stronger I really hope it lasts On the way here something happened that could have been serious I was worried about Genevieve and didn't think she would recover But to my great surprise she didn't ask to go back to Paris But she's really enjoying it here now Truly, my life has never been better I think things really started to go wrong for me at school My dad worked in a factory in Toulouse He got in a mess and killed himself My mother was an alcoholic who died in a car crash They put me in a reform school A bad place. Worse than jail My aunt came and rescued me Julie, you poor girl I've wasted too much time. Now I want to do things I won't be a maid all my life Look at Mabile, she's grown old here She's wasted the best years of her life in this place Her ambitions never went beyond these mountains Julie, I want to help you find your dreams Thank you, madame Hello? Ah, yes Right... The day after tomorrow Yes... I'll come to Perrouze Anything wrong, sir? It's the police. They have some information about that robbery They want to see me I must go into town I've never been here before It's a gloomy place This is where Alaric de Marnac is buried - The man in the picture? - Yes He was a total monster This house is the site of his former castle All I know about him is what my husband told me He killed his wife for being unfaithful The legend says he rises from his tomb to punish any Marnac woman who lives here He comes back every hundred years What a horrible story They say he's due to return soon I suppose you'd be his first victim But don't worry, it's only a legend An old wives tale... Come on, I'll show you something Here's his grave Alaric de Marnac, 1515 to 1565 "Only he will hear the trumpets of Hell..." "Only the Devil will be his friend" Here, take this I don't understand I told them to stop all this nonsense about Alaric de Marnac And now this It was horrible... that snake, such a shock That stupid girl's fault, I'm kicking her out Paul, please don't Paul, make love to me tonight Well... I don't know Quickly! Get out of here! What did the police want? To show me some pictures See if I could identify those thugs - Did you? - Yes Seems they were quite well known Looks like they might catch them soon Maybe even tonight Paul, how long will you be in Paris? No more than 3 or 4 days, I won't stay long Please, darling, don't worry, I'll be back before you know it And you've got Mabile I know. I'm being silly I'll be as quick as I can be I won't be gone long Please don't be. I need you Genevieve, take care of yourself, remember, I love you Paul, it's just that sometimes... I get depressed - But darling - Don't worry, I'll be alright - But hurry back - I will Where's Julie? I haven't seen her all day She's in bed. She had a headache I think she's got a cold Dear me, what a night. It's going to be stormy Storms round here can be bad, sometimes the power goes down I think I'll go up to bed I'll go with you No, please. I'm all right Very well. But if you need me for anything just call The bell in your room also rings in the kitchen Thank you, Mabile. Goodnight Goodnight. Sleep well The knight... Death... God bless this house How is she doctor? I think she's over the worst I gave her a sedative It's a heart problem That's out of my league - When's Mr Marnac back? - Probably tomorrow I'll talk to him about it She might have to see someone in Paris Well, I must be off. I have another call to make I'll show you out Wait here till I get back She says it was a snake in her bed. And she saw the knight Then the lights went out But the electric company say there was no power cut last night So it's impossible I told you and Julie to keep an eye on her Julie was ill in bed And where were you, Mabile? She didn't want me with her. I stayed in the kitchen I tried to keep awake, but somehow I still fell asleep This is all wrong. I don't like it at all Julie, sick, you asleep, and my wife left alone here What do you mean? Nothing, I'm just thinking out loud But I don't like it Good evening, sir Hello, Julie. How's my wife? Much better. She's asleep Believe me, Paul. It wasn't a dream. It was real That's impossible. That story is just a legend I saw him, I tell you It was just a nightmare. Forget it Don't take it so seriously... please I know you're right. I'll try to be strong Good. We'll go back to Paris soon I'll have Pierre run some more tests Tomorrow I must see the police in Perrouze again Again? I think it's just routine Come in Here's your dinner I'm not hungry But you must eat And Mabile's made something special Why did my husband have to go back to the police? I think they might have found those men who tried to rob you They've been arrested? Not exactly, no What do you mean? I believe they were killed resisting arrest Maybe he went to identify the bodies Now try to eat something Come on, I know you'll like it It's your favorite. And Mabile cooked it specially Blood! What is it, Madam? What's wrong? It's only... Only a fish Take it away! Go on, take a look. It's nothing... Mireille, you shouldn't have come. It's crazy People know me here I had to come. I had to know what was going on I told you not to contact me, not to follow me You left so suddenly I'm sorry, but you must be patient Listen, Paul Marnac I know about you. I could cause you a lot of trouble I've worked for you for a long time I know all about your business Maybe more than I should Are you threatening me? A friendly warning Just don't forget about me. Alright? Blackmail... Call it what you like You've got no class I found you in the gutter and you're still trash I gave you five years of my life You always knew what I wanted Just be patient Soon we'll have everything we planned for I promise Mabile, I have a bad feeling I sense that my life will soon be over Oh, Madam... When I die, I'm going to die alone Please don't say such things My heart is sick and now my mind is too I see things that aren't really there - Maybe I'm going mad, Mabile - Come now... - Completely mad - No, madam It's 9 o'clock. Where's Paul got to? Don't worry, I'm sure he'll be back soon Poor Paul. I've not been easy to live with First of all my moods and depressions And now this illness But I do love him I always have... I always will He loves you too, madam Paul? Is that you? Paul! Mabile... Please help me! Now take the body upstairs We'll settle up later From Paul to Genevieve, with all my love On our fifth wedding anniversary I couldn't do anything. She never even woke up Cardiac arrest in her sleep At least she didn't suffer. I'll fill out the death certificate Now what can I do? I feel so empty I'll take care of things Thank you, doctor It's no trouble Poor lady. How sad to die alone Paul, do I look good? Fantastic Better than her? Well? Of course, much better You look great That first time I saw you I knew my life would be empty without you And I knew I would kill to make you mine How long will you be in Paris? Long enough to arrange things Getting the funeral sorted. Telling all the friends and family Then the legal stuff has to be sorted The factories, the houses, the business, the bank accounts It's all mine now! Soon it will be all ours Yes, very soon. When you're my wife Hello, lover I knew you'd be back I have some things to pick up Your pyjamas? The silk robe I got for your birthday? I told you, it's not good for us to meet right now Nobody saw me. I'm very discrete The perfect mistress But I'm tired of being perfect At least say you're happy to see me Listen, Mireille, it's all going according to plan In a few days I must return to the country A few things to sort out there. Then we can be together at last Just a body. No class... no style What a mess I'm in Sleep well, my girl You think you've finally got me where you want me But your death will solve my problems Your death... Paul, can't you sleep? No... I'm a little restless Maurice, at last Drink some coffee. It'll do you good Christ in heaven knows, I'm dying inside - What's wrong? - Just thinking out loud I know this is hard for you. Let me help It's like a poem A poem that doesn't rhyme Death is the only solution I'm trapped But I must be myself I don't understand you. What is it? It's hard to understand But if the poem doesn't rhyme... If it doesn't fit in the house... Now the house is empty I'll always be here for you We'll work it out together Yes, of course we will Paul, please Can I come to the country with you? No, Mireille, it's not possible right now We have to wait We're safe here My aunt sleeps like a log I usually slip some pills in her milk Knocks her out for hours So it's just you two? The gardener comes every 2 weeks, but he never talks Apparently he's worked here more than 30 years He's deaf as a post Maurice, I really want this It'll take time, but we can be rich Really rich Important people I hope so Trust me Mireille, damn her! What to do? I must find a way out - Where's Mabile? - In town, she'll be a while Then we have time It's all fine. Nobody suspects anything When I first heard that story of the knight I had nightmares Do you remember? Now he's like an old friend The perfect partner in crime. A partner who makes no demands What shall we do about Mabile? Nothing. She won't be a problem If she is, just give her some pills and she'll sleep like a baby I don't know. You might be right Of course I am. I've known her since I was a kid Your wife was a tough bitch, she took a lot of scaring Julie, I bought something from Paris What? I hope you like it Paul! It's beautiful Anything for you, Julie How could you do such a thing, sir? I don't know. Sometimes we act on impulse, Mabile Julie is a bad girl. She has no conscience I think she drove her father to suicide She's taken drugs, been a prostitute Knew a boy called Maurice A drug addict who'd been in jail many times He was her lover. She ended up in reform school I convinced the judge to let her stay with me I thought I could change her I really did try But all I did was bring evil into this house I decided to kill my wife long before I set eyes on Julie I hated her Her superior ways, her demands, her impossible moods How her friends used to laugh at me She deserved to die But she really loved you. She told me that many times When she got ill she changed, because she needed me Then I hated her even more Her illness gave me the perfect solution You've changed. I no longer know you You're not yourself So what are you going to do? You're like a son to me I watched you being born and growing up But I don't think I can forgive this I can't Yes? No, he's already left I told you, I don't know All right, I'll give him the message Mireille? Says she's coming here to see you Damn bitch! She's real trouble Don't worry. Just let her come I hated doing that. Mabile was a good woman But she had a conscience And because of that, she was dangerous We should call the ambulance Tell them about Mabile's... terrible accident Wait, she's not dead yet Now what can we do? Paul, I'll get that — Is Mr Marnac in? - No, he's not I'll wait. I need to see him It's important Hold on, where are you going? Clean it all well. There must be no traces The doctor and the police might be dumb But we can't take chances Don't worry. I'll do a good job I'll dump the car in the lake tonight Could anyone know she's here? She was always very discrete. Never discussed our affair No, there's nothing to worry about First I'll hide the car Then we'll put Mabile on the stairs and call the cops Along come Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson and believe everything we tell them Keep calm, Julie, and everything will be fine Our luck's in I am calm, lover Very calm I thought the honeymoon would never end Thank God it has That bastard wanted it day and night And every time I felt more sick and hated him more He's such a kid, he's easy to fool I can make him do anything Soon we're going to be very rich After the honeymoon, I made him come back here That makes our job easier Soon we can be together, Maurice I love you. . Julie Thanks, it's cold in this house It's been empty for a long time now Tomorrow I'll call the engineer in, to see if we can get the heating fixed up Come on, get in the bath with me You're all wet! Stop it The big bad dragon will leave you be, but you have to scrub my back We'll always be together, know why? Why? Because we're both alike: two monsters - Aren't I right? - Well maybe you are And sometimes even monsters need love You're very deep tonight Fuck you! We're both evil... But I'm more evil, fool Maurice? It's all over, my love I played the part of the grieving widow I was perfect You got the tickets? Tomorrow then, to New York I really need a holiday I earned it, right? I'll be waiting Yes... at dawn Best no-one sees us Bye now. I love you What's going on? I'm starting to see things Must get out of here Hello? Who is it? Say something Someone's trying to scare me, that's it! Trying to drive me crazy It's all in my mind This is my house They can't get me Maurice! It must be It's him! I must escape Get out of here
