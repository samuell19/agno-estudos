Back in the real world, there's an Enchanted Attic, which is said to be a magical doorway to Storyland. Time after time a small boy or girl would enter, only never to return. - Let me get that, Cath. - Oh, thanks. - Is this it? - Yeah, I think that's about it. I'm sorry. I didn't get here sooner. It's alright. Cathy, are you really sure you want to leave? I mean, you know that you're welcome to stay here as long as you want. No, I think it's time. Where will you go? Well, the family has an old house up in Bedford. Needs a little work, and no one seems to want it. So I think we'll go up there and give this try. Good luck to you. Thanks. Brandon, I want you to take real good care of your mom. You're the man of the family now. My dad's coming back. He's not dead. He's not! - Sweety... - He's not dead! Can I drive? There's no traffic. No, sweetie. I don't think so. Dad let me. My gosh. Stay with me. Stay with me, honey. Well, you know this isn't so bad. Nothing that a little hard work and a scrubbing won't do. What do you think? Oh God! Honey, look. Brandon, put the dog down. Hold this light. Stay here. Don't move, all right? Don't move. I'm gonna go to the other room. I'll be right back. Stay here. Gosh, are you okay? Sorry. I told you not to move, honey. Well... - Mom. - What? - Mom! - Oh my gosh! Shh. - Hi. Catherine-Ann, is that you? - Uncle Monty? What are you doing in the dark? Oh my gosh. You scared me half to death. Oh, how are you? Oh my God All Mighty. Will you just look at you? You're all grown up. You look great. And so good to see you. I want you to meet someone, Uncle Maonty. - This is my son... - Brandon. I've heard some good things about you young man. Hello, sir. You're not on the base now. And that "sir" stuff isn't needed here. Yes, sir. Can I ask you something? Fire away. Is it really haunted? I wouldn't say haunted. I... would rather... think of it as Enchanted. - Enchanted? - Your great old aunt Cat, she says that up in the attic there, there's a doorway that leads to another world. You ever go there? No, not me. No, no, no. Oh. You think I could go there? Absolutely not. Not you stay away from that attic. You have to promise. Promise! Yes, sir. This place isn't so bad, now is it? Oh, come on. I figure we just camp out here until we tackle the upstairs, all right? Now. Let's get you to bed, mister. Have a big day tomorrow. You sure you don't want to sleep in Uncle Monty's? He said it was okay. I'm sure. Now, did you say your prayers? I asked God to send Dad home soon. Sweetheart, look. I know how hard it's been for you. But the Air Force is sure that Daddy couldn't have survived the plane crash. He's alive. He promised he'd come home. He promised. Get some sleep, okay? Angels on your pillow. Angels on your pillow, Mom. Good night. Outside. Ball 2. Brandenburg and close to the big curve ball. Swung and a missed strike three new world champions. Come on over here, Brandon. Hit a brace, mister. Show me some chins. While ago I told you I'd give you something when I felt you were old enough and strong enough to take care of the house - when I went away didn't I? - Yes sir. Here you go, Brandon. Wow. - My new dog tag. - You earned it. Listen, Brandon. There's a country that's in trouble. They've asked us to come and help. So I'm going to be away for a little while. But I can't go until I know that you're old enough, strong enough, to take care of the fort while I'm away. - Can you do that? - Yes, sir. - I love you Brandon. - I love you sir, Dad. Let's go home get some Chow. Double time, double time, double time! Leo? Stupid dog. Leo? We're not supposed to be up here. Leo? Leo? Leo. Leo? Anything is possible, if you believe. Leo? You in there? Leo! Where are you, boy? Leo! This is the child, who is prophesized. This runt? You can't be serious. He's a worm. But my queen of repugnancy. He has the book. The book? Well then. Dispatch the rats. As you wish. Leo! Where are you? Come here boy. Come here. Leo? Leo! You hear Leo? Leo. What happened, boy, Did you fall in? Don't worry. I'll get you out. Hey, stop it! Get away from there! Go away! Stop it! Stop it! Go away! What in tarnation have you done to my trap? Took me two weeks to dig this hole! We're sorry, sir. My dog must have fallen in, and I was just trying to get him out. Oh, all right. Come here. You know, one more minute and you would have been in there for good. Those are Queen Evilia's dirty rats, you know. What did you do to make her mad enough to send them? Queen Evilia. Who's she? You don't know who Queen Evilia is? No, sir. - She's the queen of Storyland. - Storyland? What's that? Don't you know where you are? Whoosh! What a story. But how are you going to get back? That's what I've been trying to figure out. Maybe there's something in this book. I can't read. Everyone can read. I never learned. I'll teach you. Open a new page. Okay, let's see what this says. - As Queen Benevolence... - As Queen Benevolence... kissed her beloved king... Kissed? Well Benevolence was Evilia's sister. But while Evilia is cruel and greedy, Benevolence was generous and kind. So Benevolence became Queen and bore King Love-All a son, Prince Arthur. And King Love-All, and Queen Benevolence ruled Storyland in peace and harmony. Those were the happy times, the golden times. But Evilia remained consumed with jealousy and envy. Then, King Love-All was killed on a hunting expedition... The King was killed? It took all Benevolence's strength just carry on and live, without her beloved King. She must have been very sad. She was. But all the while, Evilia was waiting and plotting. She wanted her sisters throne. Sister, you look weary. I brought you a tonic to improve your vitality. Evilia, how kind you are. Could you ask Nanny to bring some berry juice for our young prince? Of course, sister. Someday, you'll have to spend some quality time with your aunty, Arthur. But Evilia's tonic seem to make Benevolence grow even more frail. Maybe Evilia was poisoning Benevolence. Yeah. You know many of us thought so even then. Then why didn't they put her in jail? Jail? What's that? A place where you put bad people. Oh. Well until Evilia, we don't have no bad people. Wow. Keep reading. As Queen Benevolence lay dying, Benevolence sent for the King's sword. This belongs to you now, my son. When you reach manhood, in your good hands, - it will have magical powers. - Magical power? What kind of magical powers? The power to do right, Arthur. The power of truth which flows from the pure of heart. So you must always keep your heart pure. Free from anger or fear. Use the sword to protect yourself from Evilia. She has become obsessed with power and... I fear she will surely try to rob you of the throne. She died? I can finish the story without being able to read. Evilia became queen and sent her henchmen to find Arthur and the sword. See, 'cause without the sword, Evilia could never have absolute power. But where did Arthur hide the sword? Well, you see, Katarina was no ordinary friend. She'd come from a place far away. They were both very young back then. Katarina. Katerina! Wait a minute. My great aunt's name was Kat. Couldn't that be short for Katarina? It was her house I moved into. I got here through her attic. You couldn't be him. No way, you're too young. Couldn't be who? The one. The one what? The one in the prophecy. The one sent from Katarina's world, to find the sword for Arthur. Me? You think it's me? Well... you're from her world and you got the book. That's two proofs right there. I forgot to ask what happened to Arthur. Did Evilia let him stay in the castle? Oh, he's in the castle, all right. In the dungeon. They say she tortures him every day, trying to find out where he's hidden the sword. Ah, it's the old tickle and poke torture. Must be Tuesday. Where is it? Where's what Aunty Dearest? Don't trifle with me, Arthur. I want that sword and I want it now. Oh really Evilia. How many years we've been at this? I'm losing patience with you, nephew. I'm teetering on the brink of forgetting about that sword. Which means I have no further reason to keep you alive. Forgive me Your Majesty. I know it's late but... you're so beautiful. The rats have not returned. I fear something dreadful has happened to them. They never miss dinner. Rats! Did you put out the cheese the cheese? The cheese? Yes, you lop eared marmoset. The cheese, for the rats to lure them back. Oh, for Satan sake. Did you put out the cheese? I put up the cats. You know, as usual before I lock the castle. Let me get this straight. You knew the rats had not returned. And yet you released the cats. - Is that right? - Yes. Idiot! Numbskull! Saliva from a baboon's tongue! That is the end of the rats. Oh my precious rats. Gone! Eaten. History. How about I put out the cheese? Leave, while you can. Good help is so hard to find. Dispatch the Beasts. Woody, wake up! They're afraid of fire. Demons! What were they? More of Evilia's little helpers. They'll be back, but not tonight. Try to get some sleep little friend. Woody. I know what I have to do. I have to find the sword and bring it to Arthur, so I can get back home. I don't understand. It's all in the book. When Katarina had the sword, she hid it with the key that opens the door back to my world. Don't you see? It was her way of trying to protect Arthur, in case she couldn't come back herself. That way, whoever did come into Storyland, would have to save Arthur before they could get back home. Yeah. I sure wouldn't have thought of it. But where is the sword? - Does the book say? - Something's missing. Here, look. Something goes here. And the rest of the pages are blank. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. The Kings sword was inlaid with a sapphire crystal, but I don't see it. Truth is revealed, when one has Faith. Some sort of clue. Can you think what it might mean? There used to be a beautiful cave set in a large rock formation in the North country. In the Golden Days, Arthur and Katarina would picnic there with their nanny. I think they called it "The Cave of Faith". The Cave of Faith? You know where it is? Yep, The Lake of Tears. The Lake of Tears? Yep. When Queen Benevolence died, everybody cried and cried. The tears formed this lake. But, where's the cave of Faith? All the way across the lake. But nobody's ever been able to cross it, because Queen Evilia filled it with a razor fish. Razor fish? Yep. He'll cut you to shreds if you fall in. I'm not afraid. Come on. Where can we find a boat? What do you mean we? Well look, I mean it's going to be impossible. You know that I mean would never make it across alive. My dad always says, "The only failures in life, are the ones you never try." Oh no. So, your mama thinks he's gone, too? Everyone thinks Dad died in the plane crash. Everyone but me. I still hear his voice sometimes Woody. You know, like in my head, telling me not to give up on him. Jeez. I know when people die, they don't come back to life. I mean, I'm not a kid. Mom and everyone thinks I'm in denial. Whatever that means. That I'm just not accepting his death. Mmm. I know, just know he's alive... somewhere. I can't stop believing. I don't care if you don't believe me either. Meddling woodsman. Remind me to put a scorpion in his overalls. Coast looks clear. Razor fish? Dinner. You what I think Woody? The sword must be hidden in the cave of Faith. What I think is, spudder fish makes a fine barbecue. Woody, time for our reading lesson. Hm, very well. Children wept at the loss of their queen. The children wept at the loss of their queen. Young Prince Arthur realized his new responsibility. Young Prince Arthur realized his new we... ponsibility - Responsibility. - Responsibility. Leo. No! Here boy. Leo! Stay back. - Leo! Leo! - No! Wait here. Wait here. Woody, no! Come back here! Hey! Leo! Leo, come here! Come here! Is he gonna make it? What's that? Looks like poultice root. Only grows in the High Country. Supposed to have great healing powers. Can we try it on Leo? Reckon that's why he brought it. Leo? Leo! Boy, you're all right. Well. Looks like you're fit as a fiddle again pooch. Congratulations. Thanks. Who, in is that boy? You're the all-knowing one. You're the one with the Crystal Snake Eyes. You tell me. Tighter! Now, nephew. I ask you again. Who is that boy? You know, I believe I liked you better as a blonde. Come on boy. Come on. Wow, - Is that the Cave of Faith? - Yep, Let's go. - Why are we hiding? - Because there's a guard. Where? I don't see anybody. Oh, he's down there, all right, And he's plenty mean. Fierce and vicious. His name's Pouch. Most vexatious critter I ever knew. He's Australian. Clear. Time to go a couple of rounds with the old shadow then. All right. Ready? And sound the bell. As Pouch comes out swinging. A right, a left. A stinging right to the jaw Right, left right, left right left. Oh, you're flailing. He is flailing. What's that? Oh, he's got it, and a beautiful carriage ride to the jaw. That's it, he's down. Down for the count. Good champeroo! Fierce and vicious? - Well, what do we do now? - We'll have to sneak up on him, and get him from behind. That doesn't sound very fair. Well you might like getting punched in the nose, but I don't. Come on, let's go. Are you a man or a marsupial? Come on man. I've got you now. Help me! Somebody help! I can't swim! Then you shouldn't work around water! Come on, we'll save you! No we won't! Down into the briny deep. - Come on, Woody. Help him. - Mm-mm. Woody. I won't give you another reading lesson if you don't. I didn't need you, mate. Could have saved meself. Didn't need you at all. You just got in me way. We should have let you drown. Huh? I'm Brandon. You are? My name's Pouch. The perspicacious pugilist and pulchritudinous master of pugnacity. At your service, mate. Oh, well... This is my friend, Woody. - Never mind. - Since we saved your life, will you take us into the cave? Into the cave? Oh dear, dear, no. Afraid I can't do that at all. See I was sent by Prince Arthur to guard the cave with me life. Afraid I can't let any of you inside. Sorry mate, But I'm the one who was sent to return the sword to him. You? You can't be serious. Oh, yeah? We have the book. You see mate, I've never been inside. But you were inside when we just saw you now. Just in the entrance. I've never been deep in the cave. Oh, no, no, no, no. You see... It's very dark in there. Quite dark. You're not afraid of the dark, are you? Voila! Put them up mate, put them up I say. What are you nuts? I am Illuzor. You bet you're a loser. Now put them up mate. Put them up. - Come on... - Not a loser. You crooked kangaroo. Ill... Ill... If you're ill, maybe we can help. You don't understand. Illuzor is my name, - and illusion is my game. - Illusion? What's illusion? That's something you can see, but it doesn't really exists. Abracadabra ... Watch my hands, empty. My dad used to do that. Oh he did? Oh. Your dad... - is he a sorcerer? - A fighter pilot. A fighter pilot. Sort of a flying sorcerer. A noble line of work, But can your father do this? Magic. Mystic by you. Magical. Anyway, son. What are you want from me? My name is Brandon Bergen. And I'm from the human world. I think I'm the one, you know, the one chosen to return the sword to Arthur so he can free Storyland. These are my friends Woody and Pouch. That's my dog Leo. So if you would just shows for the sword is hidden, we can go and free the prince and I can get home for dinner. Hold it, hold it. Hold everything. First of all, aren't you a little too, shall I say... diminutive to be the one? Aren't you? If you mean small, David slew Goliath didn't he? That's true. He gave him a shot in the head. So if you are the one who will have to answer these, these, these questions, I have them here somewhere. Oh, good, good. I found the questions. Would you step over there? There was a young man from Nantucket. Oops, sorry. Wrong kind. Now, here's the first question. Shut up. If you were walking through the hallway of your school and you found a five Zanzar bill... Zanzar? What's a Zanzar? Our hopelessly inflated money. Oh. I'll repeat it. If you were walking through the hallway of your school and you found the five Zanzar bill lying on the ground, would you "A": pick it up and put it in your pocket? Pick it up and turn it to the Schoolmaster General? Or "C": ask those around you if one of them lost it? Well, I found a five Zanzar bill in my school yard, I would pick it up and put it in my pocket... ...and then look around secretly for the person from your world who left it there. Excellent, my boy. Excellent. Which is more important? Seeing or believing? Well, it's important to see things as they really are. But sometimes you have to believe in something, even if you can't see it. Splendid my boy, splendid. "Faith", that's another word for "believing". That's why this is known as the Cave of Faith. Because you can only find it if you believe you can. There's a third question? I thought oh, yes, yes, absolutely. Here it is. If you could make one wish, yourself at this moment... what would it be? To return the sword to Prince Arthur, and to see my father. That's perfect. You must be the one. Yes! Thank you, Illuzor. S you'll give us a sword? Sword? What sword? I don't have a sword. But I have a stone here, but no sword You don't have the sword? But that, that... That's what we came all this way for. The book! Woody, hand me the book. Give me the book, furball. Here, here. Where's the page? Sure... sure gonna miss those guys. You were right. He does have the book. And he's growing stronger. He doesn't look any stronger. See, each turn of the page the boy grows stronger. You're an ignorant shit. But he's still a boy. Just a boy. Boy with a book. And I, I devised my brother-in-law's murder, poisoned my sister, imprisoned her son, threw an entire kingdom into chronic depression. Let him top that. His power comes from strength of heart, Your Royal Moronicness. You think I cannot overcome a boy with a book? I have the power. Faith my obtusity, is power. Well I have faith, that I am more... powerful. If I have to I'll go myself and get that stupid book. Ah, ah, oh! Woody, wake up, wake up. There we go. Good day. Look. What's this then? Look. Isn't this great? Who could have done this? Who do you think did it? The food fairy? Hello? Hello. Did you just talk. Does a bear go poop in the woods? You heard me didn't you? - Yes, but I don't believe it. - Another non-believer. Who do you think did it? Your little doggie? Will you think these other two clowns did it? Well, we could if we wanted to. We most certainly could have mate. We most certainly could... I have been schlepping all night. Fly here for some berries, fly there for some nuts. I'm tired already. What do you think? I just ordered takeout? Admit it. You needed me. And do I even get a thank you? - Thank you very much, sir. - Sir? I feel so old. My name's Hoot. As in owls go hoot. Sorry, Hoot. - Why are you even helping us? - Ever hear of Prince Arthur in the dungeon? Didn't think so. He'll be no Legend unless he becomes king. But first there's an evil queen and a snake. ...that slimy serpent, Hiss? Evilia's evil. Never trust the snake. You befriend somebody, you help them, you give of yourself and how do they repay you? By stabbing me in the back and taking my old job as royal advisor. I led Moses across the desert, I can lead you out of the forest until the soil. Arthur becomes king, I become a trusted advisor. Everybody's happy. - Wow. - I like that. You've been following us for days. How come you never told us you could talk? If I told you I'd have to kill you. Just kidding. I'm just kidding. So, they found the sword. Big deal! Doesn't mean they can pull it out. That woodsman. More brawn than brain. Step aside, Woodsday. Let a real taproom give it a go. Kangaroo? Don't make me laugh. Stupid. What's happening? Why can't I see them? He must have the sword. Only the power of the sword can blind my vision. Dispatch the rat. The rats are dead. Dispatch the Beast. They're history. Well, the birds of prey then. Heads will roll this time. Dispatch with the dispatching. We make them, come to us. Hm. Not a bad idea. We have to sneak into the dungeon where Arthur is. But that's impossible. You said finding the sword was impossible. We have to go to the castle. But Evilia's there. She's very powerful you know, and hiss... It's Friday. Where are those blood sucking leeches? - You sure it's Friday? - With great certainty. Something's definitely wrong. She's never missed a leech Friday. It's her favorite form of torture. This can mean only one of two things: Evilia's renounced the very evil, which is the essence of her existence and grown a heart. Nah. Two: She's found the sword. Arthur! - Auntie dearest. - Your end is near. I wouldn't say near it's like, two maybe three feet away. His death you nincompoop! - His death? - My death? Your death, your end, your extinction. Over. Finito. Kaput. You've waited this long. You may as well stick around, see me finally obtain absolute power. Then I'm going to have to kill you with the very sword - that could have saved you. - Sword? who has the sword? Wouldn't you like to know? What are we gonna do now? Storm the castle with just the three of us? - Don't you know how to count? - What? Dog, owl, three people. That makes five. Well you know what? A dog and an owl ain't gonna be much help against the army of Castle guards. Whatever. If only there were more of us. Don't look now, but there's more of us than you know. All right, put 'em up. Put 'em up. A lot of them. Bunch of Tasmanian Devils, that's what they are. Come on. Come on. Put 'em up, one at a time. Greetings. Do you speak English? Of course we do. And we'll hear perfectly well. Silence! My disloyal subjects! Your precious prince dies tonight. Okay. Everybody remember what to do? Remember, watch out for the guards. Good luck my little friend. I'm gonna need it. Good luck. Hey you! Anybody wanna fight? Right over here! Who dares? Who dares? Prince Arthur, the sword. Thank you. You have performed a great service to me. You deserve a reward. Hey, hey! Easy, easy. Come on, now. Come on, there's a kid there. Easy. It's all right. All right. All right this way. Watch those stairs. Come on, over there. All right, that's it. What's that? Damn? All right. Please rise. We're sorry Prince Arthur. We tried to help. Your majesty, we gave it our all we truly did. - Are you real Prince Arthur? - Yes, I am young friend. So you must be the one. Thank you, for trying. All of you. Excuse me, I hate to interrupt, but I have to start shackling you. Right this way. We'll have plenty of time to get acquainted. - Be careful. - Okay. Watch that. I'm finally queen of all the world! The boy and his friends, have you killed them yet my Bloatfullness? Oh I'll kill them later. Right now I wanna play with my sword. Now that I have absolute power, I must find many more kingdoms to make miserable, to make suffer. I really think you should kill them now, oh Insipid One. Later, you slithering reptile. Don't you have a mouse to eat? I'm so sorry about this. I hope you're not terribly uncomfortable. Yeah, aren't we supposed to be? Well she would like it that way, but I'm very sensitive and I hate when my prisoners suffer. But there was this one time when I try to help, and well there was this poor starving child, and all I did was steal a measly little piece of cheese from one of her rats, and she pulled out my molars. You wanna use my hanky? Thank you. I simply can't believe that after all these years, it's gonna end like this. Leo's out there. Leo and Hoot. They'll come up with something. Two of your friends escaped? Only a dog and an owl. What help could they be? You'd be surprised what the wise old owl can come up with. Quite surprised. Here's what we gotta do. We gotta go in the dungeon, we gotta get them out. Any questions? What about Cocoland? I think that should be the next story Kingdom I conquer. Yes. Then I can go straight across the border I suggest you dispose of your enemies at home, before you make new ones. Hello. Over here in the window. Yeah you. Come over here. My God. Your bodies, those biceps. What do I gotta do to get a body like that? You must go to the gym a lot. Let's start going. Arthur look. It's my dog, Leo, The little rogue, he's brought the keys. Panzius old friend! Wouldn't mind terribly would you collect those keys at the ledge and bring them to me? I'd do it myself, but I seem to be shackled up with the moment. Oh dear, I don't think Evilia would like that. I mean she might take my canines next and then I'd have the devil's own time eating my mutton. If you free Arthur, then he'll be king, and you'll never lose another tooth. - Really? - You have my word. Good Enough for me, Sire. Bless you Panzius. Don't mention it. Shh. All right. Let's go. Start with you. Yeah, this one here. Let me just get the bad. Give me a moment. Hey, What'd you do that for? I could have taken them. Prince Arthur, Brandon. Shake a leg. I had him right where I wanted him. No, no, you were very brave, Pouch. Save your strength for Evilia. Yeah, What sounds better? Queen of the World are Queen of the Universe. I think you're the most vain and foolish villainess to draw breath since the wicked queen in Snow White. What did you say? I'm sick of you. Oh you slimy, snake faced lizard. I don't need you anymore. I wanna dance. I wanna dance. Oh yes! Dance with me. Dance with me. I order you to dance with me! I am the queen of the universe. Sword! Tail, yes! I did it! I actually hit someone. Whoo! Give me that! I have it, Prince Arthur! I have the sword. Give it to me, little boy. The sword is mine. It's of no use to you. It belongs to Prince Arthur. It said so in the book. Give it to him and you'll never get home. I'm the only one who knows where the key to your world is hidden. Is that true? Don't you know where the key is? Can't you get me home? No, I cannot get you home Brandon. But I don't believe she can either. She's bluffing. Give the sword to me Brandon. And I'll have you home in time for dinner. Your mother's making your favorite pizza. How did you know I liked Pizza? I can see her. She's very lonely Brandon. She misses you deeply. She weeps for you, at night, quietly into her pillow. She goes into your room. Angels on your pillow, she says. Only... there's no Brandon to answer. Give the sword to me, and I'll have you home in no time. No Brandon! Don't believe her. Only I can get you home. But I must have the sword to do it. What do I do? I want to go home. Follow your heart Brandon. I can ask nothing more of you. You had me scared there for a minute, but you made the right choice. - I'm proud of you. - Me too, mate. Real proud. So, you've won at last. Who could have foreseen you bringing about my demise, with such a mutley crew of allies? A woodsman, a kangaroo. The child. The book. My whole life... devoted to the pursuit of absolute power and evil. And now... I'm going to die. I'm going to die. No, I shall not kill you Evilia. Death is too fine a fate for you. Instead, you shall spend the rest of your days suffering the most hideous sight imaginable. No. You've helped save an entire Kingdom. And yet you seem so sad. What's troubling you, young friend? I guess I just never thought about staying here forever. I always thought I'd get back home. And you really want to go home? Yes. I mean not that I don't like it here. You've all been so nice to me. Except Evilia, of course. But I miss my mom. I'm sure she misses me, too. And home you shall go Brandon. But how? I thought you couldn't get me home without the key. I can't. I don't understand. The key you seek, is in your heart. The power to return home as been yours all along. All you had to do, is believe in yourself. Are you certain you don't want to stay? I'll make you my Sergeant at Arms. You'll have all the riches you desire. Thank you King Arthur, but now I have to go home. You'll always be me mate. I'll never forget you, Brandon. I'll miss you, small friend. All right, I'm home! Mom! Mom! - Mom! - Oh my god. Brandon, thank God. My baby! So I went into the attic and land in Storyland, where I had to defeat queen of Elia and her pet snake. So I could get the sword back to the prince, because I was the one. Woody the woodsman, Pouch the kangaroo and Hoot the owl helped me get back. And Leo. Sweetheart. I'm so glad to have you home. I warned you about that attic. Sorry I broke my promise to you about going in there Uncle Monty. Well, I'm pleased to have you back in one piece. Brandon, listen to me. I know this has been a really difficult time for you.
