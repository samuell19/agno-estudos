SLAVE FOR ONE SUMMER A year has passed and it feels like yesterday. We forgot the flag. Let's check again if everything is ok. I see here another piece of evidence that we need to hide. So now your husband can come back. He won't notice. No matter how carefully we clean up, our glowing desire is still written in our eyes. It's too risky, I beg you. I don't want him to surprise us. I don't even know him. He hired me on a recommendation. It would be terrible for me if he found out that you and me to have a contact. - Do not worry. He didn't marry me because he thinks I'm faithful and chaste. It will be. Elio. - Darling. Let yourself have a look. It's a dream to touch you. A privilege of the gods. You look exhausted. Your eyes tell me you're tired. Is it because you waited so long for me? It's the heat, Elio. Lust and desire. Or maybe it's because of Velma, my new employee. Velma, if anything comes to my attention, I'll hold her accountable. Pepe, load the car and bring the luggage inside. I hope the champagne is ready. It was not easy to get the Veuf Licot. This is a real surprise. You brought wonderful things with you. These great colors, look at Velma. I'm really happy. - There's something else here. Have a look here. It's a mask. Let's see how it suits you. An image. These are cute things. Where should we put it all? - Don't throw everything on the floor now. What is this here? oh my god what is that? You shameless guy. I missed that. These are really unusual gifts. Did you bring more? But you are very generous. Just hold on. Here is the pearl of North Africa for you. My God, who is that? Are you joking? It's my personal prey. The war must be good for something. She is a real princess. I can guarantee you that she is not a cannibal. Her name is Zerbal. Come on, Zerbal show yourself. My wife really wants to see your face. Take off this cloth. - For God's sake, she's a negress. What have you thought of bringing a negress into my house? It is very oily and greasy. What should that mean? Tell her to remove the oil from her skin immediately otherwise she won't step into my house. Do not get angry. She will be an obedient servant. Does she understand us? Can you talk to her? Of course baby. She already knows 300 words. She has already learned a lot from me. Zerbal say something. Introduce yourself. Say hello to the two ladies. Take heart. Greet them. You whores, run to the devil. What? - No, Zerbal. This is my house. You're using the wrong terms. You'd only say that if I got a boner and the women did not leave us alone. Do me a favor and just say "Hello, Miss Alexandra." I salute you madam... Alekandra. - Alexandra. Alexandra. How did you get her? It's a strange story. Her father was one of the tyrants who ruled the plateau. Velma notes that I'm including this in my new book. A group of black shirts besieged his house and the men were about to destroy the village. But since I was commander and chief of operations, I stopped them and the bastard realized he owed his life to me. So he gave me according to the old feudal tradition of Abyssinia his eldest daughter to me. I emphasize that it was a gift. Therefore Zerbal is now mine body and soul. I took her because you always complained in your letters that you can't find a housemaid in Italy. We do not mention that in the report. - I can complain about the staff. The local women are arrogant and shy and the rest they steal. - Alexandra, you talk about this. People of poets, sailors and saints. And recently we became a nation of rulers. Stop, are you crazy? Why? Is this night different from the others? Here we are among the civilized people. The Africa issue is over. I had to wait ages for this day. You, my dream, receive me after months of war and hardship. It was a long separation. To our love. - Yes, to our love. My darling. I actually wanted you to sleep in peace that night but a letter has come which is very important. He arrived a few days ago. Again this lawyer. That's a greedy crook. Look, it's dated May 9. He gives me a month to pay all debts. That bastard. This legal spinner. If I had died he would never have been able to collect the debts. One way or another it works. I already have a contract with the publisher. Now all I have to do is write the book. You'll take care of everything tomorrow, right? Beware! Don't you have eyes in your head? Look what you've done. Ma'am, you better watch your step. Be careful what you say. You damn bitch. Don't be so mad, Velma. It really doesn't make sense. Look, I don't want cheap scenes like that happening in the backyard again. Who told you to dress like this? - That was Mrs. Alexandra. Listen carefully Alexandra, Zerbal is like a cat. She's a jaguar that climbs palm trees and you try to tame her. This is much needed, because you missed everything, before you dragged her here. I taught her something else. In just 3 months she learned as much as a whore in 10 years in a brothel. So are we going to work now, yes or no? Velma, sit down by the machine. The beginning. Chapter One. Excuse me, get me a drink. You've already drunk the whole pitcher. It's none of your business how much I drink, remember that. After all, a writer needs inspiration. - I'm going. Are you finally ready He drinks too much. I don't understand how he can keep his head clear. We're not ready until the wine runs out. Call me a rebellious writer who has no cruel vice. You are the cruelest vice. You are very excited. Velma, where are you? We have to be careful. This is not the right time. Go now. Yes Yes! - So. This is my first time sleeping with you twice in the morning. I've missed you so much, Elio. You me too. But your lusty body tells me you're still in the mood for it. You're insatiable, that's why I married you. Darling! - New! No, don't! I really have enough. You look so interested, Zerbal. Do you think I... That I am a holy wax figure? No madam. I taught you to knock. Now that you're here, get another bottle of champagne. You wanted to tell me what you taught Zerbal in the three months of brothel school. All the tricks and games I learned from the whores too. And how is she in bed? As good as all the women who went to my school. Then she must be fantastic if Master taught her that. Start the engine. Turn the key. Stop it, that's enough. Elio, why don't you think about it? You could go tomorrow morning. I have an appointment with the publisher as early as 9 o'clock. and I want to be in Livorno before dark. I've been back for a month and didn't manage it to visit my son in his home port. He could have visited you on his day off. The Naval Academy is not a vacation. Are you ready, Velma? I copied everything and changed one chapter again. Thanks, that should be enough for an advance. Are you leaving, sir? - I have appointments, but I'll be right back. You swore you'd never leave me. I'm not going to leave you I'm only gone for a few days. In the meantime, you obey my wife, okay? But Sir. My father decided that I should serve only you. Yes, that may be true. When I come back we will discuss everything in peace. Is it true that they come back with money and pay my wages? Of course. You also get your money. This question is terrible. As if there were no other subject. It's 8:30 PM. You are listening to the evening news. Rome: The Ducce has the emissaries today received on behalf of and by the government of Abyssinia and assures the Italian government that every effort will be made to open a new era for the Abyssinian people. He specifically emphasized that this was an era of peaceâ€¦ Find another station. -... and that the relations of Italy should be intensified. His wish is that in the eastern areas of the empire the sun of the fascist... Do you think that's better? - Oh yeah. It's fun. To express their feelings of gratitude for the various efforts of Italian authorities, restore the dignity of the Abyssinian people... - Who allowed you to do that? Asshole! -... the deputies want the Duccie some... Either she leaves the house or I go. Calm down. Why do you get so angry? She does this without thinking. Remember that she is primitive. She may never have listened to the radio in her life. Sit down and let's enjoy the evening. Okay. When we make love, I feel watched. She's spying on us and you don't do anything. I have a feeling she's hiding in the shadows. It's arrogant and quite pushy. Come on, don't talk about her all night now. She's just a whim of Elio. you will see it won't be long before he's had enough of her and her will donate to the zoo. Zerbal. Come down. Be sensible and do as I say. You made a mistake. You have to treat her like an animal. Animals are treated with care, otherwise they become predators. Zerbal, I ask you. You don't want me to come up and pull you down by your hair. I won't say it again Come down. I won't punish you either. It's not your fault. I brought you a present from Livorno. What is this nonsense for? Why didn't you obey? Why did you run away? Why do you throw stones? Can you explain that to me? Sir, I don't know who I belong to anymore. I belong to only one person and can only take orders from one. Not two or three. Or maybe everyone. Then I lose part of my personality and must share my soul infinite times. My dear child, there is only one solution, for I cannot always give you orders. I will give you to my wife. From then on you will serve my wife. You will sacrifice yourself just like you did when your father gave me to me. Make some effort and read all your wishes from your eyes. Do you need so many words for a simple thing? We treat her like a friend, she helps with the housework and we give her food and shelter instead. I'm asking you, Elio. Can't we live without her? No, it is an indispensable ritual. The contract is sealed. You, Zerbal, daughter of the tribal king of the lineage, is now in the possession of my wife Alexandra and you will always serve faithfully. I find this ritual tasteless. - The operation is complete. We are all witnesses that Zerbal now belongs to my wife. You can count yourself lucky because the servant problem is now solved. This ceremony may seem strange to you, but it is very important. We can be prepared for the first difficulties. It's all bullshit. - Please come back here, Zerbal. Go to the kitchen and wash the dishes. I'm your mistress from now on, right? Thank you, Elio. Please. - Thank you. We need to do something quickly. We're behind. No wonder they don't start working until 12 noon. At two o'clock they want to eat and then they have a siesta. Stop reading or you'll have to work in the office. Now Elio, how are you? - Bad would be boastful. The publisher requests the last 100 pages at the end of the month. But we can. I'm done with my book and you paint enough paintings for the exhibition. Because now I have found an excellent model. Yes, Zerbal. It's a good idea. He can stand still for hours. You just have to tell her. She'll do what you ask, won't she, Zerbal? You make her work. Bye. If you see Zerbal, then you've come to the right place. We have excellent light here. Be so good and lie down. The best place is here. Try to look relaxed, lay your head back a little. And give your eyes a clear view of your thighs. Like this. Just hold on. You need to look a little looser. Take a comfortable position. You have beautiful skin. It's like silk. You look frail. Your body is firm, tight, and sinew, like that of a predator. You are so pretty. Are the women of Abyssinia all so beautiful? You may not believe it, but none of my tribe wanted to marry me. Because I'm so ugly. Is there love between women in your home country? Yes, that happens. Have you ever had the pleasure of sleeping with a woman? Of course I've done it many times before. In my head... But not yet with my body. You belong to me Zerbal, you know that? I long to serve my mistress. Velma! Where are you Velma! Why do I keep calling you? - I was in the bathroom. Tell that chatterbox I'm not home. I know why they ring the bell. They all want their money. He is not here. What do you want - I want to be let in. This is my father's house. Then you are Furio, the commander's famous son. You must be Velma, the famous secretary. My father tells everyone how good you have to be. Come on, he's in the house. And so we defeated another enemy tribe on the plateau. We buried 36 of our best soldiers and in the end we were only 30 men. It was our pleasure to throw 80 bodies of our enemies into the abyss. And immediately the hyenas came. That must have been awful. My son, remember: war has always been a difficult business. When you kill an enemy you feel like God but if you have to bury him, it disgusts you. During war you have to suppress feelings. An enemy is an enemy to be destroyed. But if he has a different skin color, it will make the fight easier. Then you can imagine him as an animal. It must have been a tough fight on the plateaus. The enemy was as cunning as a wolf. It was impossible to distinguish them. If you weren't careful, you were brutally slaughtered. At the slightest noise, it was advisable to focus. But then you had to dig out graves again, to prevent epidemics. I understand, father. With us, in the navy, the dead get a sailor's grave. The sea is the forgiveness of death, as the poet said. I wonder how you can talk about the dead all night. I think that's very inappropriate. It makes me sick. I want to ask you to pay attention to what you say. Didn't you see how upset she was? It's really not necessary. You talk about their peers as if they were animals. You are not very sensitive to a writer. Remember we are talking about war. I can't cover him up. It is we who write history. I have not denied that. However, you always present yourself in such a way that you look positive. I'd like to know what Zerbal thinks about it. It is God who determines the fate of a people. Now you've finally found a culprit. Forgive me Elio, but I think it's pure theory. I'm going to bed now. - What, so early? Just stay. - Your heroic deeds gave me a headache. I don't want to disturb you anymore. There you have it, Furio. You can become an old man and you will never succeed to uncover the secrets of the female psyche. Excuse me, Velma, the conversation isn't for you. You may also want to go to bed soon. Zerbal? Zerbal? Zerbal, where are you? Zerbal? I am mistress here. For heaven's sake, what are you up to? I worship the goddess of the night so that she takes me in her arms and allow me to rest in peace. You're crazy. You are so beautiful, you must not die. I would rather have died with my brothers. That would have been better than my whole life in a foreign land to be enslaved. - But Zerbal, that's not true. You are not a slave and I am not your mistress what to believe. I am a friend, your friend. Get back there, they're waiting for you. Come on, let's go inside. We will both spend the night together. No madam. I can't be near you at night anyway. When your husband comes to bed, he will chase me away. Do not worry. Don't forget I'm your mistress And I am your girlfriend, your sister, your lover. What a beautiful evening, but at some point it's time to go to sleep. Good night, Dad. I stay a little longer I can sleep in tomorrow. I'd love to do that too, but my publisher is pushing me. Don't let it get too late, Velma. You must be fresh tomorrow. Good night Good night. - Sleep well. Amazing how he got older. I do not think so. It is in excellent condition but you grew up seeing things differently. Maybe you are right. The memory changes. Especially if you have been separated for a long time. But after my mother's death, it's clear... Listen Furio, your father is a man full of energy and there is nothing wrong with the fact that he remarried. Could it be that you don't like his new wife? I don't like her and neither do I. Hello baby, say what are you doing in there? Why did you lock the door? Alexandra, open the door. Alexandra, be sensible. open me up New! - Why won't you let me in? Have you gone mad Listen, I want to be alone tonight. - Come on, open up. Open up! You see, I want to go to sleep. I'm tired You can sleep on the couch. I'll see you in the morning. I don't think about it. I want to sleep in my own bed. Now it's enough for me. Open right now! Maybe I talked a little too much tonight, I'm sorry. That's no reason to shut me out. Honey, be reasonable, I want to sleep in my bed. Velma. You are such an understanding woman. You are young and pure, Furio. Always stay that way. You have a good friend, it is the sea. It keeps you away from the temptations of the earth. But that means it would separate me from you too. I am nothing special. - I think you're a very beautiful woman. You look very good too, Furio. You are smart. Who knows how many girls are after you and be eager to make you happy. But I don't like the young girls. Sleep well, Furio. - Wait Velma. I have a request: can I kiss you? You are an exciting young man. Dream something nice tonight. So! - Good night, Furio. See you tomorrow. Elio, what are you doing here? That surprises me. What is going on? Stay here, Velma. I don't know if that... Do it. - New. I ask you. - I can not do it. I'm sorry, Velma. I did not know... Sorry. Hey you, where are you going in that outfit? Can't dress properly? - I'm just going for a walk. I ask you, respect my father and cover yourself. Do I really look that ugly? - That's not the point. You live here among civilized people. There is no point. These are the customs of the natives. Tropical customs or should I say the barbarians? The habits of the whites are hypocritical and full of shame. No, fury. Let her go Come on, let's go for a walk. Well old man, what are you looking at? Have you never seen a naked woman? Hey, great colonizer of the world. Learn to wash yourself. So Velma? - No, furio. It's absurd, utterly impossible. - But why? You said you liked me. It's true. I like you and hope this feeling lasts a long time but we just know each other for a day and still have our whole lives ahead of us. You have to understand... I am 23 and have suffered a lot in life. Age has no meaning. Only people count. I looked into your eyes and saw that you are a sweet and sensitive woman. You're the woman I've always been looking for. The woman I want to honor and love all my life. Forever. New. Don't do it, Furio. No, Furio. Please do not. Please don't go any further. be a good boy I'm still a virgin. Sorry. I didn't mean to get too close to you in any way. But I... I love you I love you too, Furio. I think it's time to go in. Good morning honey. Did you sleep well? - Good morning, Elio. Of course. Although I didn't close my eyes right away. When are you coming back? - I do not know. I take Furio to Livorno and then I have to read the second part of the book hand over to the publisher and collect. I think I'll be gone for 3 or 4 days. Don't rush your own too much, honey. But don't forget to bring money with you. Now... now that the paperwork is done, you have to pay Velma. First of all, she needs to do some reading tests. But we will also solve this problem and Velma will get her money. Can't you do it alone? What have you got Alexandra? Is the great love already over? You think I wouldn't notice that there was something between you? You seem to think I'm pretty stupid. However, I understand a few things. I am really lucky to have such an understanding husband. I've learned to take life as it is and my wife is only part of it albeit an important one. You have to be generous in certain things. I know you don't love me indefinitely. In any case, I want her to leave. It bothers me. She's around me all day. She's even been a little pushy lately. As far as I know, I think she's actually quite reserved. Unlike some others, she spends the night in her room. What do you mean? Small things are the salt of life and I allow them. But be careful not to let the beautiful cannibal eat you. Did you think I missed that too? You left me at the door anyway. I heard your ins and outs. You acted like two horny bitches. You sucked the life out tonight. It may have been good for my health. - Anyway... I want to give you some advice. Be careful and don't underestimate Zerbal. It's Furio. I ask you to be kind to him. - Of course Of course, dear. I do what you want. Goodbye, Alexandra. Goodbye, Furio. Thanks for visiting. It's a shame you're leaving us again. Yes, it's a pity, but duty calls. May I write to you, Velma? - naturally. If I come to Livorno I will visit you. We have to go, Furio. So now the secret game can start again. Listen, there are moments that cannot be repeated because then they lose their fascination. The past won't come back, Velma. Do you always have to develop new feelings so that you feel alive? Don't you understand you're burned out? Used things get boring. I really wonder who put these ideas in your head. On the contrary. Women only have one thought. They want the man to return as the winner. Unless her letters come back because the lover has died. Incidentally, I still drive past a war widow. To comfort her? - But not in a dream! Listen to my son, I am a symbol of loyalty. Remember: once loyal to women, always loyal to women. That's a good start. Watch out. I'll show you. So your fingers should be smooth. You will see how quickly you learn it. Note there. Your scent of wildness and self-importance pervades my blood. My beloved, you are doing very well. I long for you. I enjoy your closeness. It's divine. I want you. If only I could satisfy my desire. I can not stand it. Let's sleep together This was all I could find of him. And I regret that some things were lost after his death. Here's his gold watch. - It was a gift from me. He always said, every hour that goes by is an hour of thinking about me. He has often talked about it. We wanted to make a film together, based on me as a subject, because poor Filiberti was a great director. You can safely say he was gifted unfortunately he didn't know the right people. I was an actress and I had a bright future. As a very young girl I met Filiberti. I want to show you something. I have pictures from when I was young. Here I show you all these pictures. Wasn't I a sweet young thing? Isn't that very tasty? - Very attractive. I am intrigued. Magnificent. Very interesting. Really good photos. But Filiberti was jealous and nothing came of my career. Can I offer you something to drink? A tea or coffee or liqueur or something else? - Thanks, don't bother, ma'am. What expressiveness and what grace. My husband had been neglecting certain duties lately, you understand? No, I should shut up. The dead deserve respect. Do not worry. We were good friends and often talked to each other. Oh god, my Filiberti was one of those. He was talking about me. Now it doesn't matter, because they already know everything. Help yourself. I am at your disposal. Do what you want with me. See Ma'am, I don't want any misunderstandings to arise. I just want to buy one of the movies Filiberti has always talked about. And you don't want to enjoy it in the company of the lead actress? I'd love to, but my time is limited. As you wish, but I tell you, the price remains the same. With or without company: 5000 per roll. There are 15 reels including the reels with the sound. Filiberti had advised me that a roll would cost about 2,000. I understand that war brings inflation but not to any height. Let's say 3,000 without seeing them. I feel humiliated. You cannot negotiate the price with a widow. Say it, my love. You really don't want to stay a little longer? Once again very sorry, but I'm in a hurry. Can you give me the scrolls? Of course. I will send them to some customers. I'll call you back when I have some more time. Impotent guy! I'd like another glass. velma. Bring us another bottle of champagne. I am not your servant and I am not black. You damn little bitch. You have free board and lodging in this house and wants to be respected. Your husband hired me and I work all day for the money. And once I have the money in my hand, I'm very lucky that you... sends this wild man to the devil. Velma! How do you talk to us? You have probably forgotten what position you are in. I know how much you loved to shut up, which I no longer allow you. It is probably not enough that you only take the salary. Madame seems to have other plans. She wants to be the wife of De Silvestris Junior. But I wouldn't bet on that. I promise you this boy is more gay than coming to your bed. Come on baby. Let's go. We'll get the champagne alone. It smells too much like bait in here. Unload the car. - Yes But I don't understand. - It's a summer storm. One shower and it's over. Honey, come here. Make peace again and then nothing is said about it. Why should I make peace? I'm not at war? I'll kill you, you dirty bitch. On the other hand, I love you, you stupid bitch. Pepe, please take everything home. You will be amazed. I'm on to something and I've got an incredible project. I bought movie equipment so we can make a movie too. It begins. amateurish. I would have done much better. Pepe. Go to the gate. - Yes Madam. The message is here! Yes, I am on my way. It always takes ages. - Yes, I still have a long way to go. Thank you. Well, he slipped a bit. What are you looking at Finally going! My friends, the sky is clearing. There is no threat of thunderstorms, but a small southwesterly wind is forecast. Don't talk about it. Express yourself a little more clearly. You are not ready to renew the change. Not even if I pay them excessive interest. We'll make it. We will also have to work through the night. There is still a way to make quick money. When I bought the film equipment, I didn't do it to satisfy your desire. Isn't it, Alexandra? - Really and truly? I noticed that Filiberti with his dirty films served a remarkable market. This includes wealthy, Dignitaries, industrialists. People who have enough money to pay for their pleasure and where to get an offer, and refrain from immoral trade. - And who would be the actors? Well you. You are beautiful, young and passionate. You would be suitable. You three are ideal. I can imagine it very well. I do not like it. I give up my personality when strangers come to my body. - I thought of that too. It will be films that take place in Venice during the Casanova period. The women wear masks so that they are not recognized. Oh, then I'll be there. But only if Alexandra participates. - But she sure will. I'm going to write a script now. I ask you not to say anything to anyone. The thing is top secret. I imagine it this way: she plays a nun. The other... a free thinker who appears in a man's wardrobe. Tell me Elio. How are you going to create a Venetian setting here? Moreover, from the 18th century. Well, I think with pictures. I'll arrange it smartly. All that matters is an exciting story and the naked flesh. How beautiful you are, Zerbal. I made myself so beautiful for you. You can't let me go through this mess. In any case, you're not filming me with your camera. It's enough for me. I did it for you to have fun. I'm not doing it for your profit. She is right. Find actresses who are ready to show themselves naked. You'll have to do without me too. I'm not participating. If we can't pay the bill, they give us the house and we're on the street. You don't understand what it means To be guilty, beautiful princess. If you don't participate, I'll send you to a refugee camp. We find shelter in a furnished room. Of course with use of the kitchen. We have jewelry. We can use it. Let's just sell it. The jewelry is from Furio. His mother left them behind. Okay, Elio. We will play in your movie. Show your talent as a director. It's best to start with a scene that is brutal and exciting. Why don't we take my life story? When I was a virgin, men came to my village who used any form of violence. They were wild with women and even children. Our warriors had already killed them. I fled from them to a cave. And in the dark a man found me who took my virginity with the machine gun in his hand. I'm sure this story will tell your friends, the glorious conquerors. You have added a lot. I want the movie to show this relentlessly, but in my place a white woman must suffer. Velma! Alexandra! We have been moved. Are you ready for it. - I'll turn on the lights. You must always stay in the light. The camera is set up on the bed, so stay indoors if possible. Do you remember what to do? Let's repeat it again. De titel is "The Mysteries of the Inquisition". Ga liggen Velma. Good thing. You are an innocent virgin and you Alexandra are the nun of a monastery. The whole thing should look passionate and as bold as possible. You let Velma torture you. Bind your hands and feet. Tighten the rope, because it has to look real. So we would have. So like I said you're tied up Alexandra comes in and wants you to confess that you are a witch. She rips your nightgown and fall in love with you instead of torturing you. Then she slowly starts kissing you all the way. Is that clear so far? Hold on, tie this foot too. You listen to my command and when I call for action, you begin. But don't look at the camera. Do it with passion. Don't just play your lust, but so do she. But that hurts me. - It's better when you're in pain, because this is the only way you can express yourself how much you are tormented. But later you will enjoy it. I guarantee you will enjoy it. The mask. Please turn it on me. My love, you don't need it. Alexandra! Put the mask on me immediately. Alexandra! I ask you! You promised me I could wear a mask. Alexandra! - Forget them! Action! - No, I want the mask! Look at me! So you wanted me above you! New! New! - Stand still! Not so! The script allows for variations, Velma! - Leave me alone! You will feel it right away. Look at me! - New! A little more passion. Do your best more. Enjoy it. - I do not want that. So, Pepe. Now it's your turn Come on, get her. What are you waiting for I ask you, what are you going to do? You can not do that! - Be calm! New! Legs apart! Hit hard, Pepe! This is realism. But what do you say to Zerbal? It is not possible. It cannot be true that everything is over. Life has no meaning if you no longer love me. Listen, I'm still your mistress. You are mine. you are my slave No, Alexandra. You're wrong. I don't belong to you anymore. But I love you. I am yours Let me be your slave. Yes, Alexandra. You are mine and you will do what I ask. You are my big whore. You are the best of all whores. Listen. Since you are my slave, you must do what I ask of you. I am your servant, but please Zerbal, kiss me. I want three things from you. - A thousand from me. First... You kill the little bitch Velma because she's dangerous. Yes, we will talk about it. - No, now. Promise me you will. Swear it! Yes honey, I swear. Second, I want all of Furio's jewelry. I want everything his mother gave him. Okay. You understand it. And third? I want your husband as a slave too. He is already my slave. I'll give it to you. Kiss Me Be very tender to me. I need to call urgently. - The phone is on the wall. Who's there I'd like to speak to the Cadet Furio De Silvestris. It was terrible, Furio. I'm no longer the one you met weeks ago. Be brave. We're going home together now. My father will have to explain some things to me. It's no use looking at me so carefully. My answer is irrevocable: No. I don't dream of killing anyone. Nor will I take away my son's legal inheritance. I agree to submit to you for love, but only if you sleep with me tonight How do you imagine that? She is jealous and possessive. It requires no one to touch me. Not even with the little finger. Especially not my own husband. I see no problem with that. Two of them dissolve in a glass of rum and she will sleep for ten hours. You could do it with an entire football team and she wouldn't notice. Somehow it has its charm, right? She has caused us many problems. Why don't we do it? I just enjoyed it. So far everything is fine. He's ready. The ceremony can begin. What about the bitch? - He will find her and bring her here. The jewelry? - He says there will be problems with his son but he also finds a way. Well, drink to my entry. Do you see what they do? Look at this nonsense. Elio, you are now being handed over to Zerbal from my possession. Swear that you will obey or that you would rather die. I swear. You wait here for me. Can I also participate in this wonderful festival? Have you decided to come back? Is that how you behave? Just leave the house. Where have you been hiding? We were worried about you. You were probably just having fun, weren't you? New. I went where I needed to go. Now I come back to pay you back. What are you trying to say, what have you done? How stupid you are, you great genius. Hero of love, war writer and talented businessman. You don't always achieve your ambitious goals. You are a worthless worm whose fate it is slipping on knees for whores. Only someone like you could do to me what you did to me. What will the destruction of my virginity bring you? You have taken his satisfaction from your own son. What does his son have to do with it? I have deflowered you with my hands. Then I used you as long as I wanted. You are nothing more than a whore and a lesbian young thing. What a passionate performance. You should save it for later. You're just bullshit. What you may be interested in: You no longer have the film. Looks like you haven't discovered it yet. You mean, dirty, castrated drunk. What did you do with the movie? Who did you give it to? I got it, Dad. Give it to me. Come on! Give it to me! Back! Zerbal! You can't help her! - For God's sake, do something! Oh God! Lover! Control yourself! - This is so terrible! Zerbal!
