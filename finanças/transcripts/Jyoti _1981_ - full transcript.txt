Hail Goddess Durga! Goddess Bhagwati. Bless Govind with peace, happiness and long life. Goddess Durga, I have only one wish. May the eldest Prince of this family live long. Gajraj, what are you doing? Gajraj, listen to me. Dai Maa, you performed the 'puja' early in the morning today. It's an auspicious day, Chintamani. - Really? I am a religiously inclined widow. I study 'panchang' everyday to find out whether the next day is auspicious or not. But I don't remember if it's an auspicious day. It might not be mentioned in the 'panchang', but we consider it an auspicious day. Understand? Chintamani, it's Govind's birthday today. I see. Did you hear that, Sunanda? Jamuna, you went to the temple and prayed to God for Govind. Although I am Govind's stepmother, I care about him. But we can't deny the truth that prayers can't cure an insane person. Ramu, why did you put the garland around my neck? I understood. It's my birthday today! That is why Dai Maa gave me new clothes. It's my birthday! "Birds keep humming all the time." "And parrots applaud for them." "Birds keep humming all the time." "And parrots applaud for them." "They are my friends. We make noise together." "What do you think?" "Happy birthday to me." "What do you think?" "Happy birthday to me." "Everyone celebrated my birthday." "Even the animals were a part of the celebration." "Everyone celebrated my birthday." "Even the animals were a part of the celebration." "Make way for me, everyone. Here comes the King of the jungle." "Birds keep humming all the time." "And parrots applaud for them." "They are my friends. We make noise together." "What do you think?" "Happy birthday to me." "They are so beautiful and adorable." "I wish human beings could be like them." "They are so beautiful and adorable." "I wish human beings could be like them." "Monkeys make fun of human beings." "Birds keep humming all the time." "And parrots applaud for them." "They are my friends. We make noise together." "What do you think?" "Happy birthday to me." "It is believed that Goddess Sita resides in deer," "Lord Rama in an elephant, and Ravana in cheetah." "It is believed that Goddess Sita resides in deer," "Lord Rama in an elephant, and Ravana in cheetah." "Why do people call them by their names?" "Birds keep humming all the time." "And parrots applaud for them." "They are my friends. We make noise together." "What do you think?" "Happy birthday to me." "I am also locked in a cage just like them." "If I open the cage, then these birds fly away." They flew away! Insane fellow! You freed these expensive birds. Today, I will teach you a lesson. No! No! Dai Maa! Dai Maa! Dai Maa! Dai Maa! Dai Maa! Today, nobody can save you from me. - No! No, Chhote Sarkar! - You fool! No! Please don't hit him! Please don't hit him, Chhote Sarkar. You can hit me if you want. You have spoiled this mentally disabled boy. Please have mercy on him at least today. It's his birthday. Is it his birthday? Dai Maa, move! - Niranjan. This behaviour doesn't suit you. Govind is your elder brother. Really? Yes. He will be the sole owner of the property of Vijaygarh. Your dream will never be fulfilled, sir. If that is what you think, you are more stupid than him. Niranjan. Please have some almond-flavoured sherbet. You did the right thing. - Niranjan! Today, you should not have had misbehaved with the treasurer. But he... - It's okay. You have born in a royal family. But you don't know politics at all. Your dad... - You're naive, mom. I will shape the future of Vijaygarh with the help of this whip. And nobody has the guts to provoke dad against me. Raja Sahab. You don't need to take the trouble of going to court in the city. I would have handled everything. - I know, sir. I want to see how the person who swore to the Gita musters the courage to look me in the eye. He won't be able to do that. You have won the case. Pull over here. It seems there's some problem. Stop, Suraj. Someone, please save my child! My child! Help! My son! Ma'am, you saved my son's life. You have done me a huge favour. I will always be grateful to you. Greetings, sir. - Greetings. Well done, dear. It was so brave of you to save that child. As a reward, please accept this money. Here you go. Keep the money, dear. I am sorry. I had not participated in a competition. So, I can't accept a reward. Bye. Who is she? Where does she stay? I don't know, sir. But she doesn't belong to our village. Sir, I have seen her for the first time. She came from nowhere and saved the child. Greetings, sir. - Greetings. I've cleared the accounts and got the money. I've settled the accounts of Sundarpur, Lucknow and Jamalganj But people are in Mohanpur are miserable. - What happened? Last year, the village was hit by floods. And this year, they are facing a severe drought. - Oh God! They are very upset. They won't be able to pay the tax. Sir, don't request them to pay the tax. You will have to recover it. Usually, they pay the tax on time. They are not doing us a favour. But, sir, there was no rainfall this year. We are not responsible for that. If they own farms, then they have to pay the tax. I don't care if they had no harvest. In my opinion, give them some time. Sir, keep your opinion to yourself. Didn't you tell the villagers that it's my order? I told them, Chhote Sarkar. But what? - They said they were helpless. They can't even make their ends meet. If you don't have mercy on them, then they will complain to Raja Sahab. Who had the audacity to say that? Tell me. Maan Singh. Who was it? - Your Majesty, it was Keshav. Chhote Sarkar, you! - You scoundrel! Do you want to tell on me to Raja Sahab? You don't want to pay the tax! You provoked the villagers! I will break your bones! Tie him up! What are you doing? Chhote Sarkar! Please forgive me. Chhote Sarkar! - Please forgive him. I beg you. Please forgive him. He will never repeat this mistake. Chhote Sarkar! - Today, I will teach him a lesson. Chhote Sarkar, please forgive my husband. Chhote Sarkar! Chhote Sarkar! Please forgive my husband. Someone, help him! Your Majesty! Who are you? I introduce myself only to decent people. Do you know who you are talking to? Your actions says it all. Maybe you are not aware of the consequences of messing with Niranjan Pratap Singh. - Maybe you also don't know it's a sin to commit atrocities and endure them. I can neither witness nor endure atrocities. Hey! You have not only disrespected me but also interfered in my matter. You've not only hit a poor and helpless man brutally but also ruined the reputation of your royal family. Keep quiet! You should be ashamed. Bear one thing in mind. Gone are the days when brutal people like you could decide a person's fate. In today's times, you will get respect if you give respect. And show compassion to human beings. Go. I know how to punish those who provoke the farmers. But it's against my principles to raise my hand to a woman. Let's go, uncle. Gauri acted really brave today. She taught us the way to live life. Is what I heard true? You invited problems for yourself. You don't know the consequences of messing with Chhote Sarkar. He has no right to treat human beings so brutally. How could be so cruel? He hit Uncle Keshav with a whip. - What? Oh my God! I didn't see that. Keshav, you are badly hurt. - What do you I tell you, doctor? I am glad that Gauri showed up at the right time. Otherwise, I might have died. I've applied sandalwood paste to his wounds. Yes, I don't experience burning sensation now. I am feeling better. This herb will heal your wounds. Take it twice a day with some milk. And don't go to the farm for a couple of days. - Okay. Bye. - Wow, my dear! You're almost a doctor. After all, I am your daughter. Chhote Sarkar, it was purified with 'tulsi' leaves and the water of River Ganga. First, you have it. Then, we will start drinking. Prince, you don't look good when you are disturbed. Amirchand, you think I am disturbed. I am really angry. Prince, don't worry. The one who messed with you will face the music. You don't know that a doctor's daughter humiliated me in front of everyone. I can never forget that. Don't get upset, Prince. Sit down. Please be seated. Sometimes, a small defeat can turn into a huge victory. What do you mean? Your Majesty, we can't tolerate your humiliation. We are your servants, Your Majesty. We work for you, Your Majesty. Chhote Sarkar, we drink your leftover alcohol. You will get beaten up if you don't solve his problem. Your Majesty, we will seek revenge. Your Majesty, the priest Siyanandan knows all the girls in that village. Stupid fellow! - Yes. I don't care whether you know her or not. Prince, it's your duty to order them. And it's their duty to seek revenge. - What? Chhote Sarkar, that girl Gauri goes near Ganesh Temple to take a bath every morning. Tomorrow, we will lay a trap for her. 'What happened? I've heard that your daughter is unmarried.' I don't know. I've lost my heart to the woman in a red sari. It's okay, Nandu. You can ask her to tie a 'rakhi' around your wrist. What? - I mean I will get you married to her. You can do that later. First, let's obey the Prince's order. It's no big deal. We'll execute our plan as soon as Gauri arrives. - Yes! As soon as Gauri arrives, I will cover her mouth. So that she can't scream. I will hold her hands, so she can't hit us. And I will hug her from behind. Hey! It was my idea. You can't hug her. Alright. You can hug her. And I will hug you. Stay alert. So that she can't run away. Nor can he. Yes. - Why are you holding my neck? You are holding my neck! - You're doing that! You! - Hey! Wow! Amazing! You want to steal the clothes of the women in this village. Your intentions are pure evil. Gauri, I mean... I don't want to hear anything. Now, wait and watch what I do. I can't swim! Help me! Gauri, please forgive us. We won't repeat this mistake. Thank you, Gauri. Uncle! Come here. - Yes. I am coming. I am sorry. - Please! We are sorry! There's one more punishment for you. Be prepared to shave your head off! Please spare us. - Be prepared to shave your head off! Don't be scared. It's me. Stay with me. Nobody will see you. Chintamani has got an eagle eye. To hell with that child widow! I am not scared of anyone. I am scared only of your father. If he sees us together, then he won't spare me. Do you understand? - I should be scared. You said that your friend Gajraj was waiting outside. As soon as dad comes back, it will make noise and alert you. That's true. Today, in order to meet you, I have sent 50 bananas and 100 sugar cane for Gajraj. - Really? Yes. I've given him a hefty bribe. Let alone your dad, he won't let anyone come here. Three... - Three fathers! Three fathers! - Pots. Pots! - Yes. I think one of them is Siyanandan. They are Chhote Sarkar's stooges. Why have you covered your face? Where are you going, Siyanandan? Here you go! He has also shaved his head off! Hey! What's wrong with the three of you? Answer me! - You! I will deal with you later. - Okay. Run! Your dad is here! Please spare us! - Gajraj, forgive us! Lord Ganesha! What are you doing? - Please don't hit us! No! Gajraj is hitting those men. Come on. Let's see what's happening. Let's go. Oh my God! What's wrong with you? Sir, we are your servants. - We are your slaves. We are your men. I understand that. But what are you up to? What are you wearing around your neck? Why did you shave your head off? We didn't do it willingly. We were forced to do so. We're innocent, yet she got us to shave our heads off. She provoked the farmers not to pay the tax to the landlord. Who is she? - A doctor's daughter Gauri. Gauri. "O Yashoda, listen to me. Your Kanha is very naughty." "O Yashoda, listen to me. Your Kanha is very naughty." "He holds my hand tightly and hurts me. My goodness!" "Your Kanha is very naughty." "O Yashoda, listen to me. Your Kanha is very naughty." "It's difficult to walk on the roads." "We don't even step out of our houses." "It's difficult to walk on the roads." "We don't even step out of our houses." "He throws pebbles at us and bothers us." "My goodness!" "O Yashoda, listen to me. Your Kanha is very naughty." "Don't think is straightforward." "He considers all of us Radha." "Don't think is straightforward." "He considers all of us Radha." "He flirts with all the Gopis." "My goodness!" "O Yashoda, listen to me. Your Kanha is very naughty." "Take his flute away, or I won't stop dancing." "Take his flute away, or I won't stop dancing." "He doesn't listen to anyone. Your Kanha is very naughty." "O Yashoda, listen to me. Your Kanha is very naughty." Sir, the landlord is here. What? - Yes. Please come in. Welcome. Sir, I am embarrassed about what Gauri did. What do I tell you? She is immature. - Doctor. Although you treat others, you can't control your daughter. 'Conserving soil.' It's education that has made her so audacious. She went against us for the sake of a farmer because she is educated. Sir, I will make sure that she doesn't repeat her mistake. Please forgive her this time. Dad, why would you apologise to him? I have not done anything wrong. You humiliated my son. You provoked the farmers against us. You use our land, yet you refuse to pay the tax. And your daughter thinks that she didn't do anything wrong. The land belongs to the landlord as well as the farmers. What? - It's only a piece of land for you. Farmers consider it Mother Earth. You turn on the fan and rest in your room during summers. Whereas the farmers work hard in the scorching heat and plough the land. You cover yourself with blankets and sleep peacefully in winters. Whereas the farmers guard over your farms in the extreme cold. You enjoy nature during monsoons. Whereas the farmers try to save their huts from getting damaged on the farms. You people don't get affected by hailstones. Your land doesn't get destroyed, but the crops do. And poor farmers fail to provide for their families. What's your name? Gauri. We can't stop a natural calamity or change someone's destiny. There's nothing we can do. A King's duty is to protect his people, not torment them. And the people should respect the king, not humiliate him. Sir, everyone should be respected, regardless of his status. Look at Uncle Keshav. - Gauri. If he pays the tax, can you help him heal his wounds and get rid of the pain? You seem to be very stubborn. So, you should be punished. If you want to punish me for raising my voice, then I'll happily accept the punishment. Gauri! Doctor, you should do something before it's too late. You need to keep her on a tight leash. I will keep your daughter in my palace. Gauri, please apologise to him. No, doctor. You didn't get my point. I like her views. Gauri, I want you to be my daughter-in-law. Is that okay? I hope you don't mind. Sir, a poor man's daughter could not have asked for more. Please don't say that, doctor. Your daughter is educated and brave. She is not poor. Gauri, seek his blessings. God bless you. May you have a happy married life. You can meet my son. That's not needed, sir. I have met you and your family. Your son must be as capable as you. Hear me out. I won't let Niranjan get married to a doctor's daughter! Think about it with a cool head, Sunanda. It's not a wrong decision. For the sake of Niranjan's future and the reputation of this family, we need a powerful woman. Niranjan will have a bright future. And our family's reputation won't be tarnished. You've put me in a dilemma. I gave them my word. Don't ruin my son's life to fulfil your word. Your son? Isn't he my son too? Govind is your son. If you want to fulfil your word, then get Govind married to that doctor's son. You mean Govind is my son, and Niranjan is your son. You want me to get Govind and Gauri married! Why not? Gauri is strong and clever. She might improve your son Govind's life. Yes. Okay. Gauri, it's a tradition to give this ancestral bangle to the daughter-in-law of our family. Understand its importance. I am handing it over to you. May you have a happy married life. Sir, give me that box. A whip! - We have a crazy donkey. You can control it with this. A golden whip for a donkey! Yes. You will understand it later. The bride has arrived in the 'mandap'. Prince, now get down. - No! I won't get down! I like to sit on a horse. Please get down. It's a special occasion. Did you forget everything that I taught you? Yes! I remember everything. Okay. - Get down. Yes. You stay here. I will get married and come back soon. Everyone is laughing. Sit down, Prince. You also sit down, Siyaram. - Okay, I will sit. First, you be seated. The bride will bring her hand forward. Now, the groom will place his hand on hers. Offer these articles to Lord Agni. 'You are the auspicious one,' 'the bestower of all desires and our saviour.' 'You possess supreme wisdom and beauty. Salutations to You.' 'Salutations to the supreme being.' The bride and the groom, please stand up for the ritual. Get up, Prince. Please get up. - Okay. Prince, start walking. What are you doing, Siyaram? First, you ask me to sit down. Then, you ask me to stand up. Now, you are asking me to walk. I've been noticing that the groom's behaviour is not normal. They belong to a rich family. He must be drunk. No. Actually, the thing is that the Prince is mentally sick. Yes. He looks crazy. Keep quiet. This is not the right time to discuss this. Did Ramdas lie to the bride? Otherwise, why would he get his son married to a poor girl? That means the doctor married his daughter to a crazy man for money! No. Don't speak ill of the doctor. He is akin to God. Actually, he has made a wise decision. He will get to treat the royal people. His daughter will become a part of the royal family! My goodness! The doctor chose the wrong guy for his daughter. Gauri is educated and sensible. How did she agree to marry him? If her mom were alive, this would not have happened. 'If her mom were alive, this would not have happened.' 'This would not have happened.' Stop it! Stop the wedding! This wedding won't take place. All of you may leave. The wedding procession will return. What are you saying? How can the wedding procession of the royal family return without taking the bride? That's your lookout! I had never imagined that you would get this lunatic married to my daughter! I might be a poor man. But I won't trade off my daughter! Gauri, please forgive me. Throw away this garland. Stop this wedding. It doesn't matter to me how many vows I exchanged! Gauri, there is still time. Untie the wedding knot! I have chanted all the mantras for the wedding. I have circumambulated the fire and accepted him as my husband. But we have been wronged, dear! I will untie this knot and wipe off the vermillion! - Dad! Now, I am a married woman. No one has the right to wipe off the vermillion on a married woman's forehead! Not even her father! But, Gauri, think about your future. My future is with my husband. You have been betrayed! - I haven't been betrayed! Neither can anyone betray me. This is my destiny! I am quite confident. But, Gauri... - We only want your blessings. Sir, finish the wedding rituals. 'Salutations to Lord Vishnu, who has a serene appearance.' 'He rests on a serpent. He has a lotus on His navel.' Sir. Please take care of my daughter. I promise you that we will shower your daughter with love. I am sure her presence will make our lives more beautiful. Hey, what's this? Come out! No. - Why? You will beat me. Why do you say so? You won't beat me. Right? No. Not at all. Come out. Come on. Yes! Sit here. Why did you think I will beat you? Does anyone beat you? Yes. My younger brother, Niranjan, beats me a lot. Your younger brother beats you. But why? Because I am crazy. I don't know how to read and write. I don't know how to talk. Everyone calls me stupid. Stupid! I am stupid! Does your father not stop your younger brother? No. He doesn't know I am beaten up. And what about your mother? My mom? - Yes. My mom... - Yes. When I was young, she... She died. She will never return. What about the Queen? She is my stepmom. She is Niranjan's mom. She always gives me angry looks. Does no one love you? - No. Yes! Dai Maa loves me. Siyaram loves me. And... And... - Who else? You spoke to me so nicely. No one talks to me like that. Will you love me? You will love me. Right? - Yes. Will you do as I say? - Yes! I'll do as you say. Come on. Let's go to the palace. Come on! No! What happened? Niranjan will whip you. Will he whip me? - Yes. When he starts whipping someone, no one dares to stop him. He is cruel. Look! He has whipped me mercilessly. He has beaten me black and blue. Such cruelty... When you touch me, it feels so nice. Take Rs 5000. - Is that all? As soon as I become the king, I'll give away the entire treasure to you! Sir, when are you going to crown him the king? - Very soon. When I have you by my side, I have nothing to worry. I'll always be by your side. Even while carrying your dad's corpse on our shoulders. That's what I hope from you. Then, you will become the king, and I will... No! You are older! You will be the king. You were already the treasurer. So, you should get a higher position! You will be the king, and I'll be the treasurer. Wow! You will be the king, and he will be the treasurer. And no one bothered to think about me. Don't be upset, Mallika. You are my Queen. Let it be. Don't call me insolent. But I find this to be a dream. I know you will forget me. I'll never forget you. If you don't trust me, I can give it to you in writing. There are no papers here! It's a beautiful palace! It's okay if there's no paper here. But my heart knows it! You can tell the entire world that I have lost my heart to her! And you will always be mine. Your Highness, come out quickly. Your daughter-in-law is here. My daughter-in-law is here! It's not that I won a lottery! But... - Why are you standing here? Leave! Yes. I'll go. Where is the Queen? She is resting in her room. She should be present here! Go and tell her that I have called her here. Our daughter-in-law is at the doorstep. She has to welcome her. Until the Queen performs the rituals, the newlyweds won't enter the palace. Your Highness, the... - Why are you disturbing her? She will come downstairs when she is free. It's not about that. The King has ordered her to come downstairs. He asked me to call the Queen. The daughter-in-law is waiting. He said you have to welcome her and perform a few rituals. Until you perform the rituals, the newlyweds won't enter the palace. The King asked you to come soon. Do you get that? - Yes. It's such a happy occasion, and all of you are sitting quietly! Say something. I want to hear you talking. We talked a lot. - Really? Who talked? - Both of us! Wow! Tell me something. If someone casts an evil eye on your beautiful wife, what will you do? I'll pop his eyes out! No one... Hey! Am I a monster? Why did everyone leave? God knows everyone is scared of me. Chintamani, I heard a fool got married to a beautiful girl! I think our daughter-in-law didn't like your joke! My dear daughter-in-law, he is our Prince. Your brother-in-law. Why are you wearing a veil in front of him? Please tell her to lift the veil and show me her face. No, Niranjan. Not like that. First, seek her blessings. Then, you can see her. Really? - Yes. As soon as you got married, you dared to speak in front of me! Chintamani, please explain to Niranjan that he must show respect while talking to his elder brother! Shut up! You! When I got engaged, my father told me I would have to deal with an idiot in this house! Now, I understood who he was talking about! My dear daughter-in-law, you... It's quite late! You may leave! Niranjan! Don't ruin my hard work in a fit of rage! She wants to teach me to behave properly! So, I'll teach her how we live in this family! - Don't forget that the eldest son has the first right to this wealth! For years, I have been trying to crown you the king. Niranjan, please let me plan a bright future for you. Let my dreams come true. Right now, you have to handle the situation smartly. Prince. Poison the King's mind against Gauri so that he hates her. That will ensure that you don't get blamed for what you do! And you should take care of your father. Sooner or later, I have to handle my dad's position. So, why don't I do it from now? I have the power! - No! When it's time to use force on Gauri, I'll give you this whip! The Queen is absolutely right. - Listen to me. Keep an eye on Gauri. I want to know what she does every moment! Your Highness, had you not given me these orders, I would have still performed my duties properly! "A newlywed bride will come..." - Hey! What are you doing here? You were asked to decorate Prince Niranjan's room. I finished that work long back! There were some extra flowers. So, I decorated your room. But why? That's because you will get married someday, Champa. So, start practising for the nuptial night from today! Get lost! You are shameless! - Yes, I am! If you feel shy, you call me shameless! If I feel shy, I'll call you shameless! We are sensible and shameless! - Hey! Sit. - What are you doing? Sit here. Put your arms around my neck. Say something nice. Champa! Champa! Dad! - Oh no! You are worrying about yourself! Think about me! Where do I hide? Champa! Champa! Where did she go? The room is decorated with flowers! I came to Prince Niranjan's room. Prince, the servants made me drink a lot to celebrate your marriage. Please forgive me. I won't drink from tomorrow! Not at all! Idiot... - Idiot! I should congratulate him! Prince, may you always stay together. May you be blessed with healthy sons! I'll take your leave! Thank God! Now, get out of here quickly! Why should I leave now? Your dad blessed us that we stay together and have healthy sons! Did you get that? - I got it, but I think you didn't! Leave! Or should I call my dad? Why do you want to call your dad? I'll leave! Otherwise, your dad will go to Prince Niranjan's room! Hey! Don't close the door. Siyaram is going to come here. So late in the night! Why? Wow! Don't you know why? I'll sleep only after he gives me my medicine. What kind of medicine? - Sleeping pills! You also have it. You will fall asleep quickly! Do you eat that medicine daily? Yes. I can't sleep until I eat that medicine. Look. The medicines are in that cupboard. Please bring me my medicine. No. From today, you won't take sleeping pills. No. I will eat it. It's not something good. You won't eat it. No! I will eat it! I won't let you have it! No! I'll eat it! I'll have it! - Hey! No! This is opium! - Give it to me! I won't give it to you! - Give me the bottle! I won't let you eat it! It's my medicine! Give it to me! It's not a medicine! It's poison! You threw it! Get lost! Bring back my medicine! I won't get it! - You won't! So, I'll go and get it! - No! Even if I die, I won't let you consume opium! Leave me! Let go of me! I won't let you go. - Leave me! Don't you love me? I love you. - So, from today, you won't eat these tablets. But I am in pain. Please bring those tablets for me. You will have to bear this pain for the sake of my love. But I can't sleep until I take that medicine. You will fall asleep. Now, I won't let you take those tablets! I will help you fall asleep. "I'll decorate your bed." "I'll help you fall asleep." "I'll decorate your bed." "I'll help you fall asleep." "I'll sing a nice song" "and put you to sleep." "I'll decorate your bed." She threw those tablets! But she doesn't know that the drugs have shown their effect. "You should try to fall asleep." "Don't be scared." "Tonight, I am by your side" "to protect you." "You should try to fall asleep." "Don't be scared." "Tonight, I am by your side" "to protect you." "If anyone dares to trouble you," "I'll threaten him!" "I'll decorate your bed." "I'll help you fall asleep." "I'll sing a nice song" "and put you to sleep." "I'll decorate your bed." "The world is made up" "of five elements." "But no one knows how a woman" "can love someone so selflessly." "The world is made up" "of five elements." "But no one knows how a woman" "can love someone so selflessly." "I am calm and patient." "But I can turn you aggressive." "I'll decorate your bed." "I'll help you fall asleep." "I'll sing a nice song" "and put you to sleep." "I'll decorate your bed." "God knows how long" "I have waited for this night." "I wish you lifted my veil" "with your hands." "God knows how long" "I have waited for this night." "I wish you lifted my veil" "with your hands." "I wish to sacrifice my life" "to protect you." "I'll decorate your bed." "I'll help you fall asleep." "I'll sing a nice song" "and put you to sleep." "I'll decorate your bed." "I'll decorate your bed." Gauri, I... - I understood you are Dai Maa. Is Govind asleep? - Yes. Please come in. I can't rest easy until I see him. Now that you are here, I am free. Govind's mom gave him to me when he was two years old. Now, I have nothing to worry about. I have no worries. - Sit, Dai Maa. Gauri. When I heard about Govind's marriage, I got really scared. - Why? I thought they would ruin your life just the way they ruined Govind's life. Ruin my life! It was just an illusion. You have fulfilled your responsibilities bravely. No one can harm you. Dai Maa, tell me something. How did he get used to opium? He didn't get involved in it. The Queen fed him on purpose! The Queen? - Yes, Gauri. Greed turns a man into a selfish monster! What do you mean? If she doesn't give drugs to Govind, how will she crown Niranjan the king? So, the Queen decided to give him drugs. We didn't expect this! - One of our moves failed. But that doesn't mean we have run out of moves! Chintamani, come what may, Niranjan will be the king, not Govind! Come in, doctor. Dai Maa! Dr Taneja is here to examine Prince Govind. Please come in. He is a famous doctor in Kishangarh. He has just returned from abroad. Attend to him. I'll go and inform Gauri. Champa, bring tea for Dr Taneja. Doctor, will Govind recover? Why not? But let me examine the patient. I am not the patient. I am the real heir to this wealth! Niranjan Pratap Singh! Oh! Come with me. I want you to declare my brother a lunatic. Tell me the amount you want! I'll give it to you! - Oh! But I treat my patients. I don't do such deals. I think you are a good doctor. You value the lives of your patients. Well, that's how it should be. In that case, you would also value your life! Yes! The gun is loaded! And there is ample space to bury a body... What do you mean? The best thing for you is to leave! Get out! I think it's you who is mad, not anyone... - I said get out! Gauri, you and Prince Govind should come to my village. We will try our best to serve him. No one will stop his treatment there. Yes. Let's go. We shouldn't run away from our problems. Instead, we should fight them! Goddess, give me the strength so that I succeed in doing what I intend to do. Hey! What are you doing? - I am doing what you did! No. You are older than me. You should bless me. The younger ones seek blessings! - No! The younger ones do not seek blessings! They beat others! Forget that. Try to have faith in yourself. What's going on, Siyaram? Oh God! You disturbed me again! Don't you see that from today, Prince Govind will sit with us to eat? Come on! Serve food! Really? - Yes. Now, here I put this napkin. What are you doing, Siyaram? I'm tying the napkin around his neck. Why? - I always do that. Take it off. - Really? Okay. Eat. Feed me, Siyaram. Why will he feed you? Eat yourself. No! Either Dai Maa or Siyaram feed me daily! - Yes, Gauri. The Queen has ordered us to do so. And if we don't do that, she gets mad at us! From now on, you will eat yourself. See this. Tear the 'puri' like this. - Yes. Dip it in 'subzi'. - Okay. Then, put it in your mouth. Yes. - Do you see that, Your Highness? That lunatic is being taught how to eat! I will tear the 'puri'. - Yes. I'll dip it in the 'subzi'. Okay? - Yes. Now, I'll put... - Don't open your mouth so wide. Siyaram, keep the glass down. Drink it yourself. Yes. I... I learnt it! I learnt how to eat! Won't you eat? - After you. Here you go. Sir! Yes? - I want Rs 5000. Prince, a few days back, you took Rs 10,000. How does that concern you? Concern! It does concern me! It is a rule that without the king's orders... - Sir! Whether the King orders you or I order you, it should not be a matter of concern to you! Open the safe! Sir. You won't open the safe. But, dad, I need money. Even if we run out of money, your needs won't get fulfilled! First, tell him how you spent the money you took last time! Then, you will get as much money as you want! I am sorry, dad. I didn't expect you to tell me to justify myself in front of this cheap... - Niranjan! You are insulting me by calling him a cheap employee! He is the best well-wisher of our estate. He is older than you. He is as old as me, and he is my friend. You have changed the way our family functioned. Your friend, who is older than me, is questioning me! And that woman... She thinks she is the owner of this palace! No one would be so arrogant... - Who are you talking about? If I call her the doctor's daughter, you'll get upset. But sisters-in-law are not like her! It will be better if I call her Govind's wife! At least someone in this palace compelled you to think about our family! Sir. - Yes? What do you think about Gauri? Your Majesty. Only a decent man like you can value a virtuous and cultured girl like Gauri. Gauri is a gem of a person. Sir, sometimes, I think why I pushed such a decent girl's life into darkness! I wish Govind had been normal like us. Take this money. There is lots of money for you. Don't ever beg to your dad for money! Mom, I make sure that I don't spend unnecessarily. But how can the treasurer ask you about the expenditures? He didn't have to give him money from his pocket! Dad has spoilt him! Otherwise, he would have never dared to question me! I think Gauri is involved in this. Gauri! She has nothing to do with money. And then, how can she go and complain to the King? You are very innocent, Your Highness. "Don't mistake me to be delicate." "My delicacy can do wonders." "O my beloved," "my love for you is not fake." "My skin is soft as silk." "My face glows like a mirror." "My skin is soft as silk. My face glows like a mirror." "I am a rare beauty." "My beauty mesmerises everyone." "My skin is soft as silk. My face glows like a mirror." "I am a rare beauty." "My beauty mesmerises everyone." "My skin is soft as silk. My face glows like a mirror." "You made me fall in love with you." "But now, you are hurting me." "Sometimes, one has to compel himself" "to fall in love." "You made me fall in love with you." "But now, you are hurting me." "Sometimes, one has to compel himself" "to fall in love." "It hurts a lot. It causes great pain." "I am as fragrant as freshly blossomed flowers." "My skin is soft as silk. My face glows like a mirror." "I am a rare beauty." "My beauty mesmerises everyone." "My skin is soft as silk. My face glows like a mirror." "I spoke to you nicely." "And you ended up losing your heart to me." "Before making me your yours," "you must ask me what I want." "I spoke to you nicely." "And you ended up losing your heart to me." "Before making me yours," "you must ask me what I want." "One compromises on money, time and family for love." "I want my beloved to have these qualities." "My skin is soft as silk. My face glows like a mirror." "I am a rare beauty." "My beauty mesmerises everyone." "My skin is soft as silk. My face glows like a mirror." "I am a rare beauty." "My beauty mesmerises everyone." "My skin is soft as silk. My face glows like a mirror." Hey! Wait! What are you doing? Where will I get money from? I'll solve your problem. Here you go. This is enough for you. Take it. For the time being, I'll wear these rings to make my hand look beautiful. Everyone gives me money. But these diamond rings... I am waiting for the right time. Then, I'll adorn your neck with a diamond necklace! That will never happen! That time will surely come, Mallika. That's why I am instigating the heir of the royal family! So that he gets frustrated and... - The people will say that the heir of the family ruined the family! My aunt told me that you were the treasurer of their family. You were quite powerful. You had a great personality. - Right. I convinced the King to remarry. And I arranged for Rs 100,000 for Sunanda's dad so that he repays his loan. Yes. I heard you got half the amount of it. He should be ashamed of himself! - Why? I didn't even get Rs 25,000! Scoundrel! He was dishonest! It's good that he died! I thought Sunanda would do what her father failed to do after she becomes the queen! Oh God! So, did the Queen also betray you? She didn't just betray me. On the contrary, she called me dishonest, depraved and shameless! She poisoned the King's mind against me. - Oh my! And the King fired me without any hesitation! Oh God! You have been wronged. I haven't just been wrong. I have also been humiliated. My wounds might heal with time. But I won't be able to get rid of those bitter memories. Okay! So, you are planning and plotting against their family to seek revenge on them! As it is, the King is generous and has a weak heart. And Prince Govind is senile. So, Prince Niranjan will get to sit on the throne. - Undoubtedly! And I'll have the key to the treasure! Sunanda will rot in the jail of the old fort! No, Chintamani. These aren't the qualities of a good king! These days, he spends all his time at Rang Mahal. God knows whether he drinks or gambles! You should not believe such gossips about him! Prince Niranjan isn't an ordinary man! He is the younger prince! He should get some freedom. Sometimes, you pause while speaking. - Yes. This will help you correct it. Really? - Yes. Here you go. - Yes. Open your mouth and put your tongue out. One. Two. Three. Now, read it. Yes! 'The sun rises in the morning.' 'The sun rises in the morning.' Read it again. 'Sun!' 'Sun.' - Yes. 'Rises in the morning.' - Yes. Siyaram! What's that? - What? There! - Where? Here! Idiot! I am standing here, Prince. What are you hiding? - Hiding... Nothing. You are lying. - No. I am speaking the truth. This is a toy for Prince Govind! You are lying! Show it to me! Oh! They have got books for the lunatic! Gauri thinks she will teach the lunatic to read and write and make him a great poet! Poet my foot! - Oh! Did you see that? Prince Niranjan doesn't value books! When you do something good, you have to face problems. I have brought all the herbs you mentioned in the list. - Okay. Gauri. - Yes? I feel like the rays of the sun have finally lit my world. - Really? Is that all? And my feelings that the world had shut out have now resurfaced. I am overwhelmed with emotion. Really? - Yes. Are any of those feelings for me? No. Gauri. Not some of those feelings, but all of them are for you. You are my hope, Gauri. "Your embrace..." "Your embrace awakened all my desires." "I am overwhelmed." "Our love story begins, my beloved." "You have awakened all my desires. I am overwhelmed." "Your embrace..." "I seem to have lost all control over myself." "I seem to have lost all control over myself." "It is as though we have met for the first time." "Every part of me yearns for your love." "You have awakened all my desires. I am overwhelmed." "Your embrace..." "It feels like it has rained after so long." "It feels like it has rained after so long." "I am drenched in your love." "The rain fills me with excitement." "You have awakened all my desires. I am overwhelmed." "Your embrace..." "Your embrace awakened all my desires." "I am overwhelmed." "Our love story begins, my beloved." "You have awakened all my desires. I am overwhelmed." "Your embrace..." You! - I came to check on Govind. You never bothered earlier. Then what brings you here today out of the blue? Where is he? He has a name. I know. It's Crazy! Don't give your introduction, Niranjan! What did you say? - You heard it right! You should not speak to Gauri in this manner. Oh! You get a little support, and you dare answer me back! Niranjan... - I request you. Please go in. Please go to your room. He hasn't been lashed in a while, so he... Mind your tongue. And let me remind you that even I can lash you. Quiet! I want to know why this door is shut all the time! If the door is open, filth enters the house! Who do you think you are? You sing paeans! This is the royal palace, not a brothel! To a wife, a husband's house is a place of worship. And paeans symbolise her devotion and love. You would know what a brothel is! You are the scum! I am better than those who sell their souls. Money can compel anyone to sell their souls. Those who are in need of money would know. Ask your father if you get the chance! I don't need to ask him! My father is a doctor, not a businessman. We don't sell our daughters! Maybe your family has a tradition of buying daughters-in-law! Insolent! How dare you speak ill of my family and your mother-in-law! I had no intention of disrespecting anyone. But you deliberately spoke ill of my father. I regret calling you a jackass the other day. A jackass is an animal too, but not as savage as you! What are you doing? I don't even know! Niranjan spoke so rudely to you, and I could not do anything. Anyone else in my place would have broken his face! Why couldn't I do it? Other people are not cowards or weaklings like me. They are not timid! - Who says you're timid? I know it! I know it in my heart! You are wrong. I will prove that you are better than others. You are different, and strong. You are not a monster like other people! It was an ominous day when your father accepted a village girl as the daughter-in-law of this family! Your Highness, the Prince is great. He put up with her insolence. Anyone else in his place would have slapped her! I was furious, but... I think a storm is approaching. This is the right time. We must tell everything to His Majesty. To father? - Yes. But father does not listen to anyone when it comes to his daughter-in-law! He must come to his senses. He can condone everything, Niranjan. But he will not tolerate anyone ruining the family's name. Father, you made a mistake by accepting a village girl as our daughter-in-law. No one has the right to question my decisions. Tell me what bothers you. That girl insulted me in front of everyone. How so? You gifted her a golden whip and told her it was to tame a jackass! Why does it bother you? It is because she called me a jackass! Did Gauri call you that? In front of all the women! Not only that, she even disrespected our family. What! What did she say about the family? She accused my dear grandfather of selling my mother to you to repay his debts! Are you telling the truth? - I do not lie, father. If you want, I could present a witness. I have heard your complaint. I assure you that justice will be unbiased. You may go. Did you hear that, Diwan? Did I make a mistake? Was my decision wrong? I thought the family's honour would be safe in the hands of an intelligent daughter-in-law. I had no idea that this girl would drag the family's name through the mire! Father! There's no need to seek my blessing! Are you upset? Your behaviour has left me hanging my head in shame. Please sit. - I'm here to do justice, not sit. How could you call Niranjan a jackass? From his demeanour. How dare you! Even Diwan dare not speak against Niranjan. I am not afraid of anyone, father. And this is the reason you chose me as your daughter-in-law. There is a thin line between audacity and etiquette. You have misbehaved with Niranjan and spoken to him rudely. He initiated it. But he could not bear to hear about his wrongdoings. You also told him that my late father-in-law sold off his daughter to repay his debt! Did you say that or not? Father, you can decide who is guilty only after hearing the arguments of both the sides. Correct! That's why I have come here. What do you have to say in your defence? I have a complaint. - What is it? My complaint is against you and I am presenting it before you. Do not digress, Gauri. You are trying to misguide me with your words. You have deceived me, father. What! - Not just me, you have deceived my father as well. Gauri... - You have deceived your late wife and her innocent child. Gauri, do you... Do you know what you're saying? You must prove it then. If your accusations are proved wrong, you'll be punished! Father, I should not have spoken out of turn. Please forgive me. The complaint you have received against me is true. And I accept any punishment you deem fit. Gauri, you are changing the topic again. Tell me about the accusation against me! I take it back. - No, that's not possible! No one can escape justice. Not even me. If you cannot prove your accusations right, you must bow before all the family members and accept that you lied! I did not lie, father! Your wife entrusted her two-year-old son to you and passed away. What does that have to do with your accusation? It does. She requested you to look after her son after her demise. That he must not be treated as an orphan. Yes. That child is a grown up now. And you had the good fortune of getting married to that boy. There are always some plants who need support from other plants to survive. Father, you tell me. Is such a life worth living? Be clear about what you want to say. I'm saying that you are to blame for your son's mental state. Me! Not you, but your wife. Gauri, you're overstepping your mark. No. I am only telling you the extent that people go to! What do you mean? Can you tell me why a two-year-old child was given milk laced with opium? - Opium? A two-year-old was given opium! What are you saying? Who dared to do that? The one who rules the roost. The Queen. This is not possible. Why would she do this? For her benefit! - Elaborate. So that the stepson cannot ascend the throne. And has to be dependent on his younger brother all his life. One word is enough to deprive the rightful heir of his rights. Crazy! - That's enough, Gauri. You want to tear the family apart, and cause a rift. You want to destroy this family! No, father. I endured everything until now. I would not have spoken even today. But one day, you will see that you elder son will uphold the family's honour. My father thought that you cheated him. But that is not what I thought. Because I knew that a diamond does not lose its shine. With mother's blessings and God's grace, he has recovered. What are you saying, Gauri? Has Govind recovered? Yes, father. Please take a look. My Govind has recovered! What are you reading? Listen, Gauri. This is well said. 'No profit shall ever take you to truth.' 'No Bible to that supreme summit.' 'No philosophy, no religion,' 'no yoga or nothing shall ever take you there.' The author says that no one knows what the eternal truth is. Do you agree with him? Yes, Gauri. I believe that truth is an eternal mirage. It is also man's constant search. You are right. Father is here to see you. Dad! May you be happy. May God bless you. Were you reading up on philosophy, my son? Yes, dad. It's a brilliant subject. Are you able to follow? Yes. Somewhat. I am really happy. I came here to meet you. You can continue reading. Gauri. How did you make this possible? - With your blessings, father. Give me your blessings. So that I never lose. - Get up, Gauri. You are a great woman. You have destroyed the darkness in our lives. Today, I am the happiest man in the world. I have been waiting for you for so long. I came late on purpose. I thought that let me wait for you to calm down after you heard what Gauri had to say. So, you know why I called you here! I must know what happens in the house. I get to know things even if no one tells me. Because I am the queen! You know your position, but you don't perform your duties! Are you asking me this? Or your daughter-in-law... Try to understand what I am saying, Sunanda! It's a daughter-in-law's right to get love and respect from her mother-in-law! What made you do this? What greed or selfish motive made you feed opium to a two-year-old child? You didn't let him grow mentally! You rendered him senile! What else do you have to say to me? Why don't you say everything in one go? This isn't the answer to my question! I want to know why you don't accept Govind as your son! Because Govind is not my son. He is your first wife's son! Sunanda, don't forget that I married you so that you be a mother to Govind! I am a human being! I am not God! Had someone else been in my place, she would have done what I did! Sunanda! Sunanda, before being a mom or a stepmom, you are a woman! Women are kind and affectionate. Had you loved Govind, you wouldn't have lost anything! It was not about love. It was about my right! I wanted my stepson to be senile and stupid so that my son has a bright future. He would get to sit on the throne! - Disgusting! You are so selfish and greedy! You ruined the life of your elder son to give a bright future to your younger son! You have become evil because of your greed! No matter what you call me, I did this for my son's betterment. If you still think I am wrong, you can punish me. Punish you! There is no use punishing you now. Otherwise, I would have destroyed the wealth for which you ruined Govind's life! Now, there is only one way. Be sorry for what you have done and accept Govind. You trust Gauri so much! You think she cured your senile son! You can crown him the king! But I won't apologise to anyone. What are you looking for with those binoculars? Prince, I am keeping an eye on things so that we don't lose our chance before we can grab it. Siyanandan has brought us some bad news. Your Highness, I witnessed it. His Majesty has taken the elder Prince out. Prince, I even heard him say he'd take him to the court for the first time. Oh, no! - Dad must have taken pity on the fool. Maybe he wanted to show the madman around our properties and tell him, 'My dear, this is the court.' Prince, he also heard His Majesty telling Diwan to explain the accounts and books to Prince Govind. He also asked him to give the Prince all the keys. God help us! Go away, all of you! Your worthless minions have ruined my mood! Amirchand, the sun is out and I have such a beauty wrapped in my arm. But, Prince, I see the sun setting on that paradise! His Majesty is taking Prince Govind to the court. Where are you going, Prince? I won't let that hapless man ruin my life! These developments seem ominous. I never make losing bets, Mallika. The real game begins now. Hello, Niranjan. I had sent for you, but you weren't in the palace. Congratulate your big brother. Govind will take over my seat from today. This is a new chapter in the history of the family and village. It is the happiest moment for a father when his heir, his eldest son, takes over his responsibilities. No, dad. You will sit on the seat. And us two brothers will sit on your flanks and help you with governance. With your blessing, we will improve the lives of our farmers. So that our village can be an example to others. Come on, Niranjan. Govind, your thoughts are too lofty for Niranjan to comprehend. I will not accept rights that are handed to me out of pity! You didn't want to take on all the responsibilities. And the poor excuse for rights you get now is nothing but slavery! You have ruined my dream. You have poured all my efforts down the drain! Before you even got your rights, you blew your chance! How am I at fault? - Niranjan! I know you inside out. Don't think you can fool me! You spend nights with bad company. You didn't use your brains nor did you worry about my future! Mom, not everything is lost yet. You squandered the chance we had. And that is on you! Only you! Me? - Yes! I don't trust my son anymore. Her Highness is only a little upset, Prince Niranjan. What trick did that that doctor's daughter use to turn that madman sane? Your Highness, it's a flash in the pan. It is not something that will last. Don't you think it's been a long time since you whipped that madman's back? I think about 20 lashes should set him straight again. You want to sit on the throne! I will kill you! 'Niranjan!' Stop, Niranjan! I said, stop! What are you saying, Siyaram? - Yes, ma'am. Prince Niranjan is mercilessly whipping Prince Govind! Stop, Niranjan! You vile man, how dare you hit your innocent elder brother! I will teach you a lesson! That woman was hitting your son so mercilessly, and you didn't do anything! Niranjan was hitting his elder brother mercilessly for no reason. Gauri has every right to punish him for what he did. What! Is that you talking? Truth be told, it is something you should have done a long time ago, Sunanda. So you're siding with your daughter-in-law! No, I am not siding with her. All I am saying is, what Gauri did was right. She was right! - Sunanda, I understand that your son is dearer to you than your stepson. But mark my words. When you get older, your son won't look after you. Govind, your stepson, will care for you. He will also uphold this family's legacy! You have spoilt the boy with your... What's wrong? My chest hurts! I don't think you are fine. I will get the doctor! - Get me some water! Alright! Prince, these bruises on your body hurt me so much! You will no longer use the whip. You will follow my advice. Get up, Prince. Warriors have to take blows on the battleground sometimes. You still have to make your move. We have very less time to attain our goal. You have to go to the palace right now. - I will not! Until that madman's wife is there, I won't go there. I have sworn I won't! People like us make promises so that we can break them. The King is nearing his end. This is your best chance. Take this. Before the sun sets, brighten your future! He shouldn't be subjected to anything that can get him worked up or that traumatises him. Or it might prove fatal. Dad, please sign this. What is this? - Your will. My will? Why have you drawn it up then? What does it say? - The truth. 'I will my property and entitlements in its entirety' 'to my younger son, Narendra Pratap Singh,' 'because my elder son, Govind, is mentally unstable' 'and hence, unfit to inherit them.' You are insane! You thought I was going to die! Your greed has blinded you! Call it what you want, just sign the paper. - No! Dad, sign the will. No! Never! Father, he is right. All we need is your love, not your wealth. Please sign the will. - He will not sign the paper! How could you stoop so low? Your dad is unwell, and you are worried about the will! Give that to me! Give it to me! You wretch! You worthless boy! Get out of here! Mom! What are you doing? - Get out of here! I am ashamed of calling you my son! Get out of here now! Siyaram, what are you waiting for? Hurl this wretch out of the house! - Dad! Dad! - No one can take away my inheritance! Calm down, dad. I will take what is mine! I wish you were never born! Get out of here! Gauri, I am entrusting you and Govind with the legacy and prestige of our family. Dad! Don't let our family fall apart. Sunanda! - Yes? Please look after these kids. - Yes! Dad? Dad! - No! No! Mother, did you want to see me? Yes, my dear. I am so embarrassed about the things I did. I am unfortunate indeed. I destroyed a beautiful home. Don't say that, mother. Gauri, even if the Lord forgives me, I can never forgive myself. Here. Take care of your house now. And please tell Govind to make arrangements for my pilgrimage. - No, mother! We have already lost father. Please don't leave us and deprive us of your love. 'Mark my words.' 'When you get older, your son won't look after you.' 'Govind, your stepson, will care for you.' My daughter! Mother! Really, I am unfortunate. I failed to realise your goodness. My dear! - Mother! The princess is such a drama queen! 'I would have been an unfortunate woman' 'if I hadn't got the chance to serve my mother-in-law.' O all-seeing Lord, I only pray that You protect the Queen from that witch's spell! Chintamani! - Yes, Your Highness. I was only praying to God for your safety and health. You can stop praying for me. Get out of here! You will not stay here another minute! What are you saying, Your Highness? Have I done something wrong? - Wrong? You have done enough damage. You turned my love for my son into a poison that burned this family's happiness into ashes! Your Highness... - I will not listen to you anymore! Pack your things and leave the palace at once! Oh my goodness! Everyone in this household, even the animals, hate me now! Siyaram, please hand me my bundle. You will not get it back so easily. Gajraj wants us to search your bundle first. Search my bundle! Do I look like a thief? You know that best. - You wretch! This is an insult! My God will punish you for it! I am not scared of your god. I worship only two gods, Prince Govind and Princess Gauri. Do you understand? Four saris, four underskirts, two blouses and a handkerchief. And Rs 200 tied in the handkerchief! The Queen gave me the money! If you don't believe me, you can ask her. - No, my lady. We can let you keep Rs 200. And if you need more, write to us. We will send you more with the Princess' permission. Oh, please don't bother! Give me my bundle back! My lady, please calm down. Wherever you go, Ahmedabad or Allahabad, may you be happy. Until I have brought you two to your knees, I will not rest! Do you understand? Bring us to our knees! What on earth! Well done, Gajraj! - Darn you! You have bathed the young widow in mud, and purified her! - I curse you all! You will never prosper! - Get going, my lady. Gajraj, get them! Oh, no! What is this? Don't be afraid. That lady got what she deserved. Now, I will get you two married. - What? Father! - May God bless you! When a man has lost everything, he fears nothing. And a man without fear can do anything. What's left now? - Everything you had before. There's still the wealth, property, prestige and honour! But they all belong to Govind now. To be worthy of it all, you need smarts, courage and a little brute force! I have tried everything. I remember you telling me about how Govind has stopped having opium. - Yes. To that, I said, 'So what if he has stopped having opium?' 'He can still be stopped with a bullet.' - No, Amirchand! I do not want bloodshed! Even I am not a fan of bloodshed, but it is the only option you have. I will have Govind abducted tomorrow and held captive in the old fort. - No. I cannot do that. We will treat him with the utmost respect in the fort. After we get him to sign a new will, we will let him go. No harm, no foul. We will lawfully get what we want, and Govind will be safe. Is that possible? Don't you worry, Prince. You still have supporters who can lay their life down for you. Jaswant Singh, move the carts. - Sure. Come on, take him! It's awful, Princess Gauri! The goons wounded Jaswant Singh and abducted Prince Govind! It's none other than Niranjan behind this disgusting act! Mother, may I? - Of course, dear. Go ahead. 'O Goddess mother, bless me with strength' 'to save my honour.' 'I want to risk my life for my husband.' Taimoor. - Yes? Why did you remove this hub from the buggy's wheel? - Fool! This is not a hub, but the key to the Princess' death! What do you mean? - The wheel will come off, and the buggy will go down! Hey, wait! Where are you taking me? Oh! So, it was you! Amirchand! - Yes, he's a dear friend. You do know me! Oh, I know you very well. - Great. My mom says, the only difference between you and dogs is that they wag tails while you wag your tongue. Govind! - Oh, pardon me. Calling you a dog is an insult to dogs! Dogs are loyal! - Shut up! You too were once worse than an animal! Your wife is the reason why you stand here and mouth off to us! Niranjan! - Just do as I say, or you will never talk again. Don't worry, Amirchand. Prince Niranjan, I hold myself back because he is your elder brother. Or I would have finished him off already! Here. Work fast. I do not like unfinished business and your hapless life. Come on, sign the document. Your wife will never come to your rescue. What does it say? That you will the estate to me. - I was ready to do that. But your actions have made me suspicious of your intentions. Stop that rubbish! Niranjan, Amirchand wants blood. And I want my family. I don't want family! I want the estate and the throne! Alright. You can have them. But you people will not live in the palace. I do not want to see your wife's face again! If that is your wish, I give you my word. You will get whatever you want. But you have to give me your word! - What? Once we are gone, you will look after mom. - She is my mom, not yours! Sign the paper! Come on, people! Hurry! Do you know what's written here? - I know! You will all of the estate to me and leave the house to live as an ascetic! You fool! You know nothing! It says that the two of us sell our property to Amirchand to pay off our debts! That's impossible! He isn't just betraying me, he is betraying you too! That fraud wants to get rid of us both at the same time! Amirchand! The man you call a dear friend is our family's foe! He is a snake in the grass! And a wounded snake is more dangerous and poisonous! I will wring your neck! You wretch! Get him off me! - I will kill you! You fraud! You brown-nosed me all this time so you could stab me in the back! Don't tell me you thought I plied you with drugs and women for friendship! I will extort my expenses today. Sign the document, or the royal line will come to an end today! Sign it! - No, you will sign it! Wealth is not more precious than our lives. Give that to me. I will sign it. Good boy! Govind, don't sign it! Hurry, people! - Onwards! So, you won't sign it? Niranjan! Niranjan! Niranjan! No! Niranjan! Niranjan! What are you doing? Amirchand, I will sign that paper, if you spare my brother! - Let me die, Govind! Please don't sign that paper! Don't sign that paper! There! You got what you wanted, you wretch! Didn't your wife tell you that a leopard doesn't change its spots? Scoundrel! You wretch! I will kill you! No one can harm a hair Amirchand's head! Govind! Let me see how long you two can hang on. Princess! Siyanandan, I had made sure the buggy crashed. Then how did she survive? It's alright. She won't leave this place alive. Close the door! What is going on here? Stop this! For God's sake, let them go! I cannot see this! Siyanandan, the poor Princess couldn't bear to see this sight and has fainted. Sir, I can kill her if you want. - No! Put her in the dungeon! - Yes, sir! Where are you going, my dear? Where's the fire? Leave my sister-in-law, you filthy animal! I thought I was a goner! Take this... Oh! Run! Run! This is a great hiding spot! Hey! What's happening? Stop! Someone, help! Someone, please help! Get me down! Please put me down! Help! Come on, brothers! - Knock it down! Use all your force! Don't you dare take another step! Come on, move! Gajraj is here! Make way! Princess, whom do you wish to see die first? Take my life and spare theirs! Come on! Attack! - Onwards! Break the door down! Attack! Please help! Chilli! Take that! Now, it's your turn! Please let me go! I have three wives to look after! Gauri! Govind! - Mother! Mom! - Are you two alright? Yes. Come on, let's go home. Come on, Niranjan. - No! Mom, forgive Niranjan. No, Gauri. I will never forgive him. He is the one who ruined this family. Please accept him and make the family whole. Mother, an ocean becomes what it is because it embraces every river that comes to it. Gauri! - No, Niranjan. Gauri. If they are the two lamps of this family, you are the family's light. Did you hear that, Gajraj?
