I'm back. Why are you here? I left Kamakura, so I came back here. Idiot! I wanted to see you... I hate him. Did you have a fight? Not really. Might have been a fight, but not really. We split up and I came. I hate him so much! When you're planning on coming back, you should at least call first. Don't surprise me! I didn't have a phone, and I didn't even have 10 yen. Y'know, I was in the middle of my bath! Do you want me to wash your back? No way. I brought this for you. Here. Eh? Neri, go make miso soup or something. Something hot! Hm. Okay then!

Younger Sister, You were not very beautiful So I was really worried Because your husband is my friend, Occasionally, the three of us, Should go have a drink together Younger Sister, After dad and mom passed away, you... And you alone, are my cause for concern Before you leave tomorrow morning, Write me the recipe of your miso soup Everyday Restaurant Good morning. You're listening to society's partner, National Radio. The radio station without any music. Look forward to our morning news, coming up right after our sponsors. Hello there. Good morning. Are you Neri's big brother? Yeah, I am. - I'm sorry. - Huh? Did she come back home? Oh, so you're Kozo's... Yes. I'm his younger sister, Izumi Wada. Has my brother come with her? Huh? So they're not together, after all. My brother has gone missing. - Let me speak to Neri, please! - Oh! Please, let me meet her! I took the first train here! I have to go to work right now, so... I couldn't sleep last night. I have a lot to ask her! - Okay, get into the car. - Please. - But... - My sister is asleep right now. Okay? Here you go. Oh, good morning! Good morning. - Working early today, eh? - Yeah. Hm? Where's your beard? - Well, you know. - I see. - Drive safely. - Thanks. Huh? They said they were leaving, then they left. - Isn't he over at a friend's? - I tried calling them all already. Didn't he find another woman? That's pretty common. I don't think so. - Why? - I don't know. So, you're her sister in law, right? - That's right. - Hm. Must've been hard, the three of you living together. It's not like that. I was staying at the store. They were renting an apartment nearby, and we'd meet often. Y'know, I think it might be better if you don't meet Neri. - It might be. -Yeah. At least for now. I want you to leave her alone. 'Kay? Oh, I have to take a left here. C'mere! C'mere! Geez! Izumi. You can wait for me around there. I have a job right now. - I'm fine here. - Really? If you say so. I'm looking for a college girl, who's moving to Waseda. Do you know her? There's a lot of apartment buildings around here, so... Biba House This has never happened before. This is no good. - Isn't there a number you can call? - There isn't. The call came late last night, and it sounded like it was a from a pay phone. Damn it, is this a joke? Good grief! Neri... I'm sorry, Akio! I got it. Damn it, that call... That was you! I didn't mean to deceive you! I called because I had finally gotten back to Waseda. I saw the phone, and I wanted to hear your voice, but then I did, and I couldn't say I was back. Just don't say anything, then! You didn't have to interfere with my work! I was free until noon today! Which is why I asked for it first thing in the morning. Are you kidding me?! I should hit you, really! - Neri. - Stay away. What happened to my brother? Did you hide him somewhere? Please, tell me. What did you say to my brother?! It's your fault. - Of course not! - Yes it is. The truth is... I was planning on killing him and then myself, but he ran away. Did you hide him somewhere? - Uh, hey st... - Get away! Get off me! - What'd you do to him, bitch?! - Stop it! Hey, Izumi! - Wait! - Let her go. - Let go of me! - Hey! Let me go! Neri! Neri, get back here! - Stop screwing around! - No! - Come on! - No! - You idiot! - Ouch! It hurts! - Come on, now! - Stop! - You're coming right now! - Let go! You're hurting me! - I don't want to! - Get up! Get up! - Let me go, you jerk! - Get up, now! I'm up, damn it! - Come on, what's wrong with you? - It hurts! I'm coming, stop dragging me! - Geez! - Damn it! Wait in the car! - Izumi. - Huh? Please, go home for today. I know her the best, since I'm her brother. It's no use trying to talk to her when she's like that. But my brother... I'm sorry, but this is my family's problem now. Your family is not related to us anymore. Please. Where are we? This is Koenji. Where in Koenji? We're not too far from the station, I think. How do I get back to Kamakura? I don't know the way! Hm, I see. Well, I'm sorry. Here, fix this. There, there, it's okay. Hey. Huh? Sorry for barging in. Are you the little sister? - You're kinda cute, aren't you? - Kinda? I heard a lot about you. From my brother? You're a Virgo, right? Me too! He talks about you all year. Here, I'll help. Come on. Thank you. And you are...? Akio hates potatoes and cabbage. And he likes carrots, bell peppers and pickled radish. You know all about him, huh? It gets dirty around here sometimes, right? I come to clean up! Oh, it's about time I go. - I give a lesson around here once a week. - Lesson? Despite my looks, I'm an Aikido teacher. I'm a 3rd degree black belt of the Ryukoku school. Y'know, I've been talking to your brother. I want to turn this place into a training room, or a dojo. Isn't that a good idea? It's a waste to use all this space as just storage room! Right? I guess you're right. I'd cover this floor with tatami mats. And put up a sign! "A dojo for the working woman who wants to look good!", how's it sound? There's a lot of fat women, aren't there? Put a good word with him for me, will you? Well, anyway. See you! Remember to lock the door when you go out. It's dangerous around here. - That's all of it, right? - Yeah. Have you decided where you want the desk? - I think here is good! - Oh, is that so? Okay, so by the window, right? - That's right. - Okay. Oh, excuse me. I think it'll look good once you put it in order. Thank you for the hard work. I think there wasn't anything extra. - You drove quite safely. - Is that right? Well, here you go. Would you like a cold drink, maybe? You don't have any more work today, right? - Hm, well... Yeah... - Okay? Well... Have a seat. Eeny meeny miny moe. Eh? Ah. Oh. Oh. Hey! Oh, hey. Oops. Guess I'm caught. That's my loss. Is this okay? I like it a lot, it tastes kinda like medicine. I'm fine with anything. Oh, I'm sorry. Damn. - Sorry about that. - No problem. - They might've stretched a little. - It's okay. My toes are numb. Don't you feel disturbed in a room as messy as this? Don't you feel like getting messy too? Very messy. Me too. You see... I don't really want to pay you for the work. Okay? Come here. That hurt! Ouch! - You... - Huh? It's nothing. Ouch! It hurts! Be more gentle! Oh, geez! Oh, I'm finally home! - Welcome home. - What are you doing? What do you mean? Today is mom's death anniversary! See? Is it? I had forgotten. I finally found a photo of dad. We gotta let them have a date once in a while, right? I was the pitcher this time. - This is my favorite photo. - We were so young. You were what, five? You can't get old when you die quick, eh? That took a dark turn. - Is that so? - Yes, that's so. After dad died, mom kept working the restaurant all alone... I was never suited to work in a restaurant. Making food is very hard. Mom died because she was too busy. She was serving breakfast, right? I still remember it. The breakfast set was 95 yen. With the miso soup! Huh? - Did someone come here? - No. No one came. Yes, this is the Kojima residence. Huh? Leave us alone, will ya? That's already settled! That's a false accusation. Alright? It's getting annoying! I'm hanging up. I'll do it! You're welcome any day! Waseda Everyday Restaurant This is a story from when I went on a seaside class trip, in elementary school. On the second night, all three of our teachers got blackout drunk. Then they felt kinda sick, and threw up all over the room! Eh, thank you for that charming story... Well, that's all for today's Friendly Cha-... Come on, honey, don't cry! Look! I'll be taking her there right away. Okay, we'll be waiting then. Okay. You're Neri Kojima, right? Are you Kenji? Nice to meet you. Well, like we spoke on the phone yesterday, all of our family, or rather us siblings at least, are in uproar about Kozo's disappearance. We want to sit down with you and hear what happened. Izumi is also waiting for you. Izumi? I don't want to. You're putting us on a tough spot, running away like that. Running away? It's not just a matter of preferences, is it? And it's not like there's nothing in it for you. You'll tell us everything you know. And, of course, we'll say what we have to, too. My brother and his wife live nearby. It's okay, we're leaving soon. It's been over a week since you two fought and he went missing. Let's think of a way to find him, together. You know... I only came because you said you'd come instead of Izumi. It's right over there! Now, come on. One, two! - One, two! - One, two! - One, two! - One, two! - One, two! - One, two! Here. Come on. What will you drink? - I'll have black tea. - Whiskey for me. It's on the shelf in the pantry. Get what you want. How about you? - I'm okay, thank you. - Is that right? - How about you, bro? - Huh? - It's cool, I'm working. - Oh? Isn't it fine, though? You don't have to pretend to be working so hard at a time like this. - I'm on a deadline, actually! - Oh, is that so? Are you still working the boutique, even without Kozo? - Take one. - Yeah, but it's hard to do it alone. Here, you too. Anyway, Kozo is a weird guy, isn't he? When he wanted to open the store, he tricked dad into giving him money even though he was against it. - I'll leave it here. - Why'd he just leave now? It's Neri's fault. I'm sure she did something horrible to him! Come here, come. Come on, get up. Did you instigate Kozo to ask our father for his savings? That's not right. So, he was the one manipulating you, right? That's absurd, sis! Of course not! You met him after he opened the boutique, right? Yes, that's right. Oh! It must be Eiko. I'm sorry I'm late! The taping for the late night show took until now! Hey, what are y... Oh. Did you really like our Kozo? Did you love him? You know, I have a radio show targeted at young people. So I understand people your age really well. There's a lot of old people who write us too, but I usually ignore them. You're mistaken. Huh? I came back to my brother's in Waseda because I grew tired of the sea at Kamakura. It seems like people can suddenly think of their older brothers as men. A while back y'know, I got two or three letters about that! You're mistaken! Seems like that's all she knows how to say, eh? It's just my own thinking, but Kozo probably found another woman somewhere, and is just leading his life as always. We should leave him be. It's nothing to do with us, anyway. - Stop that. - Shut up! Get out! Don't look down on me! I know you're just trying to stall. Come on, Mr. Kojima. Let's make a deal already. It'll be good for everyone. Okay? What was that, you bastard?! We even found you places you could go live! If you leave within 20 days, I'll even somewhat take care of you. Bastard! - What are you doing? - Let go of me, bastard! You bastard! I'm gonna wreck this place, you bastard! Cut that out! You jackass! Bastard! Wait a minute! No! Give it back. Come on, give it back. - You took something, right? - You little thief. There's more, isn't there? This feels like a joke. Well, anyway. Don't do that anymore, miss. We'll call the cops next time! Oh! Why is your face hurt? Eh? It's nothing. Is that so? But there's some broken stuff in the shop, too. What are you doing? My bellybutton. Huh? I'm filling it up. Sometimes I wonder how it'd be if I didn't have one. Is that so? Huh? Is that so? Y'know... What? Instead of lazying around everyday, why don't you find a job? What d'you think? - Hm... - I've been looking. Akio, I... - Huh? - Actually... I was summoned by his siblings today. Was Kozo there? - Why? - What do you mean "why"? Wasn't he there? Of course he wasn't! There's no way he would. I mean, have you met his siblings? You think he was so fed up of them that he ran away? I don't think that's the case. About Kozo... I wonder why he left so suddenly. Neri. What would you do if he showed up here, now? Would you make up with him? No... No way! It's not like I can be around forever, right? Right... Don't panic, Neri. Kozo's calling for me. Idiot. Oide Boutique Sorry for the other day. I want to ask you the truth. But that's a weird store you have here, eh? Let's go out. I wish I could go wander aimlessly too! Hm. - How is Neri doing? - As well as she can. But she won't tell me anything. It's okay, then, right? Why'd you come here? Well, I was just worried. About me? About my brother? Which is it? Huh? It doesn't matter. I don't want you to worry anymore. I gave up. - You gave up? - That's right. I won't look for Kozo anymore. The others, my oldest brother especially, say he's just gone off to screw around, and are pretending nothing's happening. There's no point in only me insisting. And besides, I'm still running the shop. Even if it's a shop like that, it's still hard work! I can't let those ghosts control my life forever, right? Seriously, it's just ghosts! Did you say "ghosts"? That's what I said. I mean, that's how it is. - You mean Kozo? - And Neri. They were like empty shells, without soul. Even now... What an idiot! Huh? I'm talking about myself! Being left alone in a place like that... I'm pissed off, even now! I'm gonna go for a swim. No! Get out, get off me! - Get off! - Ouch! Ouch! No, I don't want to! Get off of me! No! Get away! Fresh wounds are the highest sign of love, they say. Since Neri came back, I feel like I'm gradually turning into a barbarian. Why is that? I think the decadence is in our blood, inherited from our parents. Every time our father drank, he would suddenly start chasing our mother around, resentfully cursing at her. When I was a kid, I was very scared of that. Neri was a baby, so I wonder how it was for her. Is its unfair for me to ask you to forget your ghosts? They're pulling on you even stronger now... But won't you take Neri in again? Rather than that, she needs to be around other people. Someone that's not her blood, like me. It's okay if it's only with the excuse of helping out at the store. Their apartment is still there, right? Of course, I'll pay the rent until Kozo comes back. Ah! Kamakura... What? Is that bad? Is it bad? Don't go deciding things for yourself. Why, though? It'll be good for you! This is all because of your selfishness! Good grief! Some nerve you have, to talk like that. - All in all, she's a reasonably good kid. - Who? Huh? Izumi, I mean. We didn't have a chance to speak properly until now, because of all the misunderstandings. You spoke to her alright, eh? Naked and all. Did you have fun? Huh? It's too late to try and hide it, Akio. We got the report from Kamakura a while ago. Report? A phone call! You're the worst. Huh? "Your brother forced himself onto me today." "Inside a public bathroom." - That's what she said. - That bitch... Why are you mad? You're the one in the wrong! That's not something to go telling a third party like you. Third party? That's an awful way to put it. You mean I'm just some stranger? No, c'mon, I mean Neri, who has nothing to do with it. Anyway, that was her goal all along! - Her goal? - Yeah. She wanted Neri to know! She wanted Neri to know we did it! You mean you got caught in her trap on purpose, then? What a story! You're gonna try and say it was for Neri's sake, too? You committed a felony on purpose for your sister's sake? Are you a child? You little...! Stop it, Akio. Anyway... I have my reasons to do what I do. I'm sad that you don't try to understand it. Just do whatever you want! It's a little cramped, I wonder if you'll be okay. You have to, okay? 'Cause I put in a good word for ya. I'm sorry. It's okay. She needs people there, it's been pretty hard. I feel like I'm a nuisance just being around. I don't know about that. But Akio was the one who said to do whatever, right? I brought her, auntie! Oh, that's a great help. Will it work out? She doesn't speak much. It's okay. As long as she can stand. - Well, take care of her then, please. - Go upstairs, please. Excuse me. I'm going back then. I have work to do. You can stay as long as you need. Oh, by the way... My cousin, Midori, comes home later. Oh, she's home. Is it her day off? She has tendinitis or whatever on her right hand, so she can't move it. It's a pretty bothersome disease she has. Oh... Hello. Look out. Ouch! Thank you. Tendinitis, is that it? I can't really move my hand because of it. Because work was too demanding. - What do you do? - I work at a hostess bar. Oh, a hostess bar? Yeah. I keep coming and going. You're a pretty weird girl, aren't you? You think so? There's no sign of any suffering on your face. Huh? It's kinda... like a Buddha or something. - It's hot! - Move aside a bit. Here. Hello. - Are you Mr. Wada? - Yeah. I'm Kojima. We spoke on the phone. Oh! It's all good, isn't it? - Anyway, come in. - Okay. Come on in. Well... When Kozo comes back, we'll make it official, so... - It's all good, isn't it? - Well... Is it really okay? I know my sister will be a burden, but... It's all good, isn't it? Is that so? Then please, talk to your siblings too. Oh, don't worry. I won't let them complain about it. Leaving that aside... I think I understand Kozo's feelings a bit. To summarize it, for him Neri is something that is no longer... Huh? Kojima. Kojima, isn't it best if we don't treat women with such high regard? I understand, and I do recognize that there's something of value to them. "That" is something like our backside, after all. However the backside is just that, after all. Can you reach your own backside by yourself? We should leave that aside, and focus our efforts on the completion of our own selves. At any rate, I'll let you handle this business with Kozo your own way. Well, then, goodbye. Void That's pretty lousy handwriting to try and make a design with, eh? It's just "sky" written over and over. It's not "sky", it's "void". Oh, "void" is it? - Yeah. - I see. - It might be a hidden message. - Huh? See? It was written as a suicide note, after all. Is there something to do with their missing relative? Nah, that's not it. I wonder... The man committed suicide by taking sleeping pills, and when the wife found him, she killed the child and then herself. That's what we think, right? The wife died by gas poisoning. I'll tell the coroner. Okay. - This is a textbook case of a doomed marriage. - Huh? I mean, they had no chance of getting it right from the start. At any rate, this is one weird way to die, eh! - You won't tell anyone? - You know I won't. I'll tell you, then. I won't be surprised, no matter what. I've killed plenty of men at work, every night. I killed him. My lover. Oh, is that true? I wonder when it was... This one night... We got into a fight over something small. Izumi is his younger sister, you see? She was pretty tangled in our life, so I got fed up, and left saying I was going back to Waseda. He came after me. I'd gone to a temple where you could see the sea. We walked a lot while hurling curses at each other. - Why now? - Things changed. What happened? Do you really... I don't hate you. Goodbye. Hey! I don't really remember how far we had walked. It was a dark place, very high up. It's over. I'll jump. - Go ahead. - Come with me. - I don't want to. - Why not? - Because I despise you. - Is that so?! What are you doing? No! No! I... rather than saying I pushed him, I was so frustrated that... I tackled him. He fell. Kozo fell. He fell. I killed him. I was crouching there for two hours, spacing out. Then I was overcome by a sense of fear and I couldn't stay there any longer. So I got into a train. You'll forget it, eventually. It's no big deal! Come on, drink. Was it around here that I tackled him? You don't need to keep reminiscing. And you shouldn't tell anyone that, even your brother. I'll forget about it too. Yes. Were you listening, mom? Of course not. Is that true? Okay, then. If you were quietly listening in, you'll pay for it! I might have to beat you up, mom! I don't know what you're talking about. If you say so. What's that? Oh, there was a double suicide at an apartment in Harajuku. Neri, isn't this your boyfriend's...? What? Looking at the changes in the stars, there's a chance to divine You're going to the funeral, right? - Why would I? - Huh? I've nothing to do with it, but... Well, you're kinda... Related to them, after all. This double suicide thing is messed up. It's just killing one another. Akio! - Why? - Eh? Who did you ask about the store, anyway? Huh? Minako? I don't speak to her anymore. The old woman, then? Maybe Kozo will come to the funeral. - He won't come. - He will if he sees the paper! He won't come! Go to sleep, you must be tired. It's okay, isn't it? There's no way I can sleep on a night like this. You're that kind of woman. You can't help but be bothered by that kind of thing. Y'know... Hm? You're really my little sister. Even though you're a woman... Ouch! I'll go to the funeral. I'm Kozo's family too, after all. That's what I was telling you. Let's see, mom's clothes were... There they are. That is how I grew into being this woman (Buddhist sutra) My condolences for their sad passing. Why'd they die? I can't make sense of it. I wish we'd seen this coming, somehow... Won't Kozo come back even for the funeral? Even though it was plastered across the newspapers... That's a fantasy. The information was just being told one-sidedly. A bride outfit is there too, right? Yeah. Mom had too many clothes. Idiot! Don't talk like that. Try this on. This too. Go be a bride. - It's okay even if you don't have your partner, right? - Partner? Kozo, of course. But he's missing. For now. Anyway, you'll put on this bride outfit... And go back to the apartment in Kamakura. He'll come back before you know it! He'll probably never come back if you're not waiting for him. Because he'd have no home to return to. And we have no idea how to look for him, anyway. Should I wear this? I made up my mind. Huh? I'm leaving this place. You're leaving? After you marry into their family. I have my own plans for the future. I'm getting good money for the place. I'll even give you a dowry! You'll leave within one week. A lot happened, but at last we've reached an amicable solution! Alright! Let's take a picture! A picture! Huh? We'll ask the old man out front. His wife will help with the fitting. She does, it's written on their sign! Akio. Don't cry! You're a bride, y'know? You're really going to be married. Hey. What's wrong? Maybe I shouldn't have let you go to the funeral. - Will Kozo... - Huh? Will Kozo really come back? Isn't that why you're going to his family? To wait for him. You're really in love with Kozo, aren't you? Right? That's it, isn't it? Akio. Yeah? Thank you! What are you going on about? - I'm sorry! - Idiot. You've taken really good care of me! Okay, I'm going to take it now. Alright? Miss bride, look over here! You're in the way, move! I'm taking it! Ready? Good! Here it goes. Okay, I'll take another one too. Look here and stay still. Good! Hey, Neri! Aren't you forgetting anything? No! There's nothing left! It's okay. There's a lot of those in Kamakura. - Hm. - Let's go. Yeah. Neri. You disliking it is the only reason we're getting rid of the place. Where will you go after you're free? Don't worry about me. Akio, lock the door! There's nothing for anyone to take! I'm sorry for making you come to a place like this. It wasn't something I could talk about on the phone. How should I put it...? I don't understand! Has Neri really gone missing? Yeah, it's been over a month already. I see. Do you really have no idea? I don't. Just what happened to her? What's in the note, anyway? Huh? I didn't understand very well. "I want to go to a temple where I can see the sea", something about that. But she didn't say where. Hey! Hey, over here! I found the temple. They say she shaved her head. Shaved her head?! Yeah... But she's not there anymore. Where'd she go? They say she left with a young monk from the temple. But they ended up splitting up. That idiot. There's no leads left. Isn't it better if you don't look for her? If you do look, you might die. It's because they keep looking that people die! So it's better not to go looking. I did something terrible to you. I'm really sorry. But I'm gonna look for her. Whether she's somewhere or not. I have to. - Hey, Mr. oden vendor! - Huh? Yeah? Oh. I'm here! I'm coming! Sorry for the wait! We want to take some oden. To go, then? What do you want in it? Radish, konjac and a potato. Who is this woman? Oh, she's like a relative. - Your girlfriend? - Something like that. Okay, give me one of those. - And one of these. - A potato. There you go. - Is it ready, mom? - Here. Oh, yeah, konjac right? I want a potato! - Give us another potato, please. - Sure! Okay, that'll be 600 yen. 600 yen... I'll leave it here. Here you go. Thank you. Let's eat over there, okay? Thank you very much. Wait for me! Mom, hurry up! Coming! Younger Sister, he is a very good guy So, whatever happens... Please bear with it And if it really, really Just doesn't work out... Come home to me, Oh, younger sister THE END
