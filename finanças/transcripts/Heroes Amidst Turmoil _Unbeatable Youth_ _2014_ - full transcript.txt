This is outrageous, how dare someone steal things from me. Do you know how important that jade stamp is to me? I don't care what you do, but go find me that jade stamp back! Jack, Show time Brother, this time we Chin Woo Association rendered such a big merit those foreigners can't do anything but be mad. Shou Cheng, don't be hasty, be careful. Who' s up there? Shou Cheng, go. They are over there... Shou Cheng, go quick. Shou Cheng. Shou Cheng. Wish be soft not be strong, wish to concur not to oppose. Seek harmony not chaos; long for togetherness not distance. You're back! Miao Ian What are you doing? Come with me. Ao Ge, you're in trouble... sister has been waiting here since this morning. Big trouble, looks like you can't get away from this war. You all be quiet, hold this. Miao Ian, I actually... Where have you been? If you didn't want to come back, you didn't have to. I know you are worried about me. Who says I'm worried about you? Sorry, it's my fault. I apologize. Hey, Nan Sheng, your father and your mother fight every time they come back? Your dad is so strong! Look, he fights with big sister for so long and still going. Who do you think will win? Ao Ge will win for sure! Umm. Nan Sheng, what do you think? My mom, definitely wins. No way. Don't be so loud, or else they will hear us. The kids are outside, don't you be presumptuous. The kids will grow up someday. I am serious, don't want to set a bad example for Nan Sheng. We are husband and wife, what is there to worry about? You lost, you do the dishes today. I am going to make dinner now. Hey, all three of you come here. Go clean the fighting hall, otherwise no dinner for you tonight! Okay, will do, Sister! Nan Sheng, don't you want to practice calligraphy with dad? Go on now. Nan Sheng, did you miss daddy? Yes Good boy, come give father a hug. Aiya, Nan Sheng is so heavy now, I et daddy kiss you. Ha... come tell me, when daddy was away, were you being good to your mother? Yes, daddy daddy. Didn't you say you were teaching me how to write? Now, now! Ok, teaching Nan Sheng to write. Lu Sheng! Wan Ting! Ao Ge. Nan Sheng, say hello! Hello Uncle Lu Sheng. Hello Auntie Wan Ting. Nan Sheng is so good. Ao Ge, the kids say that you lost to Miao Ian again, you got to do better next time! That's right Ao Ge, you need to show the women how it's supposed to be. Hey, how many times have I said not to touch. I know, don't be angry. Be careful of the baby. Wan Ting, you and your sister Miao Ian, one can talk and the other one can fight. How can us big boys compete with you two? Good thing you know our capability. Nan Sheng, Auntie take you to get candied fruit later ok? Thank you Auntie Wan Ting! Ok, let's go. Ok, be careful Hey, watch where you're going, I can't fall. Yes... my queen, be careful and walk slowly. Come on. Daddy take you to practice writing, ok? Okay. Let's write the character "father". Okay. Do you know how to write it? First stroke is ... Father, how come I can never write it well? Ha... Nan Sheng, let me tell you. The most important thing when you write is sit up straight, steady hands, focus your mind, so that you can feel the strength from the tip of the brush to the paper. Alright, let daddy show you again, ok? Steady hand, first stroke, second stroke, just like this. OK, good, keep practicing. Father Ah Ao, how are things going in Canton? Everything going well? Things are fine, the matter in Hou De Town has already subsided. Hmm, ai, I hope peaceful days will last long. Oh yes, how is Mr Guo in Hou De Town? You should learn more from him. Uh , Mr Guo's store is all good, next time I will tell them you say hello. Good, then I won't keep you, should get some rest. - Father, take care. - Umm Hey! Nan Sheng is so good, let daddy carry you to your room. Ah Ao, did you have a nice trip? Oh, it was very nice. Right, I may go to town with Lu Sheng tonight, will be back after two days. I see, but Wan Ting must be telling Lu Sheng off now that you two are going out to town again. Lucky I have such an understanding wife. Ha, Nan Sheng is so cute. Ever since he was little, he's always fallen asleep holding your clothes. Al, you see. I think Nan Sheng has grown to look more like me now. Looking like you isn't good. What's not good? Having one that's conceited in our family is more than enough, we don't need two. Confident, not conceited. Sh... don't be so loud. If Nan Sheng is awaken, he's not going to let you leave. Oh yeah, I got a lucky charm for you today, let me bag it up. Sh... Push over here, come on, quick... Move faster, follow closer, yeah. It's too dangerous inside, I'll go alone. Lu Sheng, you stay outside and keep an eye out. Ao Ge, the twelve generations in our Tan's family, no one has ever been afraid of dying. The two of us, can't... Now you're bearing three lives, if something happens to you, how do I explain to Wan Ting? Wan Ting tends to worry, I'm not afraid. I worry, fine, be quiet. Listen to me. But... You're a brother to me and let me go! Here, take this. If you see a signal that means it's failed and we both leave on our own, you understand? Yes. Stop running... Where is the Kung fu boy? He jumped into the water, I don't know where he is. Ah? Follow me. Why isn't daddy home? Honey, your father has something important to do, so... has to be home later, ok? You go play. Sister. What's wrong? Lu Da Ge is back. Then... where's Ao Ge? Don't know. There seems to be only Lu Da Ge, and he's hurt. Got hurt? Go Lu Sheng, what happened to you? Did you get robbed? Lu Sheng, what's the matter? Where's Ao Ge? Sister, I am so sorry. Why, what happened? Come on tell us, what happened? Ao Ge maybe already... Already what? What happened to Ao Ge exactly? Tell me. What are you trying to hide from us? You're not telling us anything, how can we help you? Even if I told you, you couldn't help. Then what exactly happened? What happened? Tell me. What's going on? Actually, Ao Ge and I in the past few years have been working for Chin Woo Association, but using business as a cover. Every time it has worked out fine, but this time... Then how about Ao Ge? Where is Ao Ge? Why do you have to yourself in such danger? You are actually doing this? Where is Ao Ge now? Where is Ao Ge? Originally we planned to use smoke as signal, if it fails we leave separately. But I heard the guard said that he got beaten up and jumped into the ocean, unsure if he's dead or alive. There are guards all over the pier, Ao Ge probably can't escape. Sister, I am so sorry... Why didn't you tell me about all these things? Why did you do this? Why? Master Run. Grandpa Ah... Sister, go quickly. They're here, run. Nan Sheng, Nan Sheng. Dad, what happened? Where's Nan Sheng? Go save Nan Sheng Good boy, Nan Sheng, don't be scared. It's okay, mom's here, mom's here. It's okay, Nan Sheng's gonna be okay. Mommy's here. Dad Dad, Dad Get Nan Sheng out of here. Daddy, are you okay? Let me get help. I can't make it. Listen to me, quick... bring...Nan Sheng to Canto n... Hou De Town... De Chang Store, look for a guy... named Guo Tian. He will... help you... find Ah Ao... Dad, Dad Walk, walk faster Walk, faster Lu Sheng Come, wash hands. Nan Sheng, you hungry? Mommy got you some food Come, eat. Nan Sheng, you're not hungry? Eat some. Nan Sheng, say something, you okay? Are you tired? Take a nap. Take... Nan Sheng to Canton... Hou De Town... De Chang Store, look for a guy... named Guo Tian Keep talking! Tan Lu Sheng Did you think of wife? Yu, my troubles have nothing to do with my wife and kids, don't you harm my wife. Ah... you are such a good man. Don't worry, your wife is fine. But if you don't cooperate. What do you want... I am a legitimate businessman who doesn't want violence. We want the jade stamp and not lives, so as long as you cooperate and tell us the name of your partner and where his family is, we will make sure your wife comes back to you safely. Hey... Say, what is your partner's name? Yu Jie, my partner is Tang Ao, let my wife go. Tang Ao, where has he taken the jade stamp to? Hou De Town in Canton Whoa, what's the matter with you? Watch out. You're bumping into my stuff, damn beggar. You walk with eyes closed? All my things are ruined. Whoa, what's the matter with you? Watch out. You're bumping into my stuff, damn beggar. Have you seen this person? Yes Huh, we didn't have to waste so much time if you'd said it earlier. Lu Sheng I'm okay. I'm okay. Go. Yu Jie, you said you would let us go! I only said I let you see her, never said letting you go. You... How about this, you be my bodyguard. You're asking me to work for you? In your dreams. Yu Jie, you bastard. Lu Sheng Tan's Legs Twelve Ways, I must have a way to make you, ha... Hey, don't, don't. Lu Sheng Yu Jie, Karma will get you. Karma... I'm waiting, ha... Madam, you want to take it? Nan Sheng, Mommy go to buy ticket You wait for mommy, sit well Don't walk away, good boy Stop! Nan Sheng, Nan Sheng, ah... Excuse me, there was a boy over there, about this tall. You see where he went? About five or six. Miss, did you just see a boy? There was a boy sitting over there, about five or six, this tall. Have you seen? Mister, did you see a boy about this tall sitting over there Nan Sheng, it's okay, don't be afraid, mommy's here Hey, come have a look. The more you buy the cheaper. Could you tell me where De Chang Grocery Store is? Go straight and turn left. Thanks. You two, keep staring at the opposite side, want to buy some salt? Don't know what you're talking about. Or just having a guilty conscience. Hey, going already. Haven't seen enough yet. Sister, your punch was very good, but your waist... eh. I'm looking for Guo Tian. What's the matter? Ah, you're looking for my father, There's a kid too, I might have a brother now, dad is old and intact. Brother, don't be silly. Do you belong to Chin Woo Association? I want to find my husband. Oh, lady. We don't know of any Chin Woo Association. I think, ha... you are at the wrong place. Yeah, you come to find husband at a grocery store, and with a kid? I need to see Guo Tian, I have something I need from him. Lady Hey hey hey, hey, who the hell are you? Come shouting and yelling Then I go find him myself. You can't just come in as you want. Complement hands with figure and complement figure with hands, front-line punches, chained pointers, it's Ao Ge's fighting style. She must be... Stop! Dad How is Mr. Guo from Hou De Town? Bring it over Wan Ting, listen to me and don't go Lu Sheng, don't stop me. I must see Mr Yu Hello... - Don't move your hands! - Don't stop it. Mr Yu, no, Master Yu, I ran out of Longevity Cake. I'm begging you to give me some more. Wan Ting Don't touch me Madam, Longevity Cake I have plenty, but you're pregnant now. Being a conscientious businessman, I just can't let you have anymore. Let me help you. Wan Ting Yu Jie, she's pregnant, are you out of your mind? Huh... I really can't help her! Master Yu, just once please. It's killing me. It's not that I don't want to help you. I wouldn't do business at a loss. In fact, as long as your husband Tan's Leg Twelve Ways, Tan Lu Sheng, cooperates with our company, you will have endless supply of Longevity Cakes. Too bad... I would never work for foreigners, especially foreign traitors. Wan Ting, let's go You see, I really can't help you. Master Yu Lu Sheng, Lu Sheng. Just do it for the kid, I beg of you. Just for the kid, you must stop doing it. Lu Sheng, it's really killing me, without it I'm going to die. Pregnant wife kneeling in front of husband crying in hysteria, I really can't look at it anymore. Let's go. Mater Yu, I'm begging you, begging you. Wait wait, okay, I'll help you Right, that is what I call a good father and good husband. After the deal is done, you will be rewarded. Trust me, your future is looking bright. Go to my office tomorrow afternoon, I will tell you what to do. Enjoy your Longevity Cake Thank you Master Yu Ah Ao has been working for Chin Woo Association all along without telling me. Now that my father's dead, comrade's also dead, all of a sudden all these things happened. Nan Sheng is still so young, I really don't know what to do. The agent who coordinate the action has been killed by the British. We, Chin Woo, have always been the executioners who act upon the coordinator's orders, so I really don't know where Tang Ao is at the moment. Ah Ao is nowhere to be found. Before my father passed, he told me to come find Uncle Tian... Now I can't even go home, Nan Sheng is sick, ...really don't know what to do. The British sent men to you home to look for Tang Ao, I believe Tang has the treasure they're looking for. I wonder where it's gone. Don't worry, Ao Ge is a good fighter, he will be fine! Sister, with all the things happening right now, I reckon it's safer for you to stay here Yes, Ao Ge will definitely bring the treasure here, you should just stay and wait for him Thank you. But I am telling you now that anything related to Chin Woo, unless also related to Tang Ao, I will not participate. Of course. It's okay, it's okay Lu Sheng? Where is Ao Ge? I need him for something. Lu Sheng, you okay? Where's Wan Ting? Miao Ian, tell me now, where is Ao Ge? I don't know where he is either, I'm looking for him, too. Lu Sheng, why are you acting strange? I'm so sorry, but I trouble you to go to Foreigner's Pier with me. Foreigner's Pier? Please don't be mad Ting Ting, you okay? Father, I told you to watch the store, don't always buy things Have you practiced? Uncle Tian, Ting Ting got injured because of me, I really feel bad. I OK, Don't worry But don't you think it's strange? Miao Ian, you said the guy who attached you was your neighbor, Ao Ge's partner? Hmm, I also worry about Lu Sheng, he keeps asking me where Ao Ge is, Ting Ting is not around either. They must be using Wan Ting to threaten Lu Sheng I can't think of any other reason besides that. Wan Ting is a close sister to me, plus, she's pregnant now. A country can't be without families. Our country isn't a safe place at the moment, things like what happened today can happen again any time. Tang Ao is sacrificing his life and safety for the country, hoping to end the chaos in China. I understand whey Ah Ao is doing this, but I just don't know why he didn't talk to me about it. He didn't tell you perhaps because he didn't want you to worry, he loves you. I do worry that if something happens to him, what will I and our son do? Don't worry sister, Ao Ge is so good at martial arts, he'll be fine. Right, sister? Right right, in the previous actions it was so dangerous and Ao Ge got so close to... this time will be okay too! Thank you all! Don't worry Miao Ian, Tang Ao will be back Thank you, Uncle Tian. Nan Sheng Let's eat. I got inside information there will be a shipment of national treasure china going out of Hou De Town pier. The man behind this has the same target as Tang Ao's previous task, and is very likely to be the same organization. Tonight we must stop them before the shipment leaves the pier. Dad, I'll go Your arm is injured, should stay. Zhen Nan, me and you go this time. Dad, I will be fine, just let me go. Dad, I need to take care of Nan Sheng, plus I'm in charge of collecting all the information. Zhen Nan, I am telling you to do. Ting Ting, you listen to me and stay home to recover. I go with you Ah, how can you? Sister, didn't you say that you will not get involved with Chin Woo Association's affairs? Ting Ting, you got hurt because of me, I should go for you. If my husband is a national hero, me being his wife should also follow his path, right? Zhen Nan, Tong Tong, please take care of Nan Sheng for me. Father... Good, Zhen Nan, Tong Tong, take good care of Nan Sheng. Miao Ian, you come with us for this action, and my plan is... Foreign bastards, really are doing these dodgy things as expected Hmm, we can't let them ship these national treasures out. Careful Who the hell are you? Hello! Kid, let's go and have some fun! What do you want? What I want is simple - Tang Ao and the jade stamp I don't know who is Tang Ao, and have never seen any jade stamp Huh, I see that you won't tell me. Jack Miao Ian, go back and get the brothers here. Let me handle this. OK Tonight I am your opponent. Good Tan's Legs Twelve Ways, you are Tan's descendent. Looks like you are all the same, claiming to be righteous and patriotic. Huh, all useless in reality. White-head, stop! Put Nan Sheng down, white-head, don't go, sister, hold on Hold on Sister, it's all my fault, don't cry Uncle Tian, should we chase? No, let's get these treasures back first. Yes. Hurry Up Let's go - Don't cry, is OK - Tong Tong Zhen Nan, what is happening? Sister, I'm sorry Nan Sheng, Nan Sheng, where's Nan Sheng? In the evening, we were playing with Nan Sheng outside of the store, but this foreigner came all of a sudden and grabbed Nan Sheng away. Brother and I tried to stop him, but that bastard had a gun. Who are they? I think those foreigners came here for Ao Ge and the jade stamp. I have to go find Nan Sheng Uncle Tian please help me. They made Nan Sheng suffer, and he's too scared to even talk. Calm down, Miao Ian. Listen to me, they kidnapped Nan Sheng is just for getting Tang Ao and the treasure. I believe that they will not do any harm to Nan Sheng for now. Then Uncle Tian, what should we do now? Don't worry, I will think of something. Wu Ge, Sun Jing, Cao Jin, send some people to the border, pier, and police station. I want information from both the dark and bright sides, go now. Yes, Uncle Tian Miao Ian, I'm sorry I can't even protect a young kid. Did you see this boy? Did you see two suspicious men passed by with a boy tonight? This is the photo of that boy. One of them was a foreigner. - A foreigner? - Yes! was a foreigner Didn't see it. Going, thanks. Wu Ge. Anything on your end? - Your side? - Nothing. Go. Uncle Tian, it's been so long and they still haven't found him, I can't wait anymore, I'm going myself. Hey, Miao Ian, don't be hasty, sit down Uncle. Sister Ao Ge Ao Ge Ah Ao! What's going on? Dad is dead, Nan Sheng got kidnapped, where have you been? Dad? Nan Sheng? Who are you? I am Miao Ian You bastard, walked out on your family and now wants to hit me? Dad I'm supportive of you working for the country, but you have to be honest with me. You haven't told me anything, and just came back after so much happened. Ah Ao Ao Ge Ao Ge Go chase after him Oh... Dad Ao Ge Who are you? Do I know you? And who am I? Who am I? I bet the kid's parents are stupid, that's why the kid is retarded too. I bet, his parents must be atrocious, his dad is a traitor, his mom a whore. Haha... Otherwise he wouldn't be such a mule, huh. Eh, what? You're mad? Oh, stupid kid gets mad too? Huh! What are you looking at? What are you looking at? You want to get beaten up? Keep looking? What are you staring at? I said your parents are garbage, trash. Tang Ao, do you know your partner cost me a big shipment of china? I don't know what you're talking about. You know me too? My... my name is Tang Ao? Stop pretending. Where is the jade stamp hidden? I really don't know JACK, follow me It's time to meet the motley crowd now! Everyone has travelled a long way here, I prepared some high quality tea for all. Please enjoy. Mr Yu, I am going to be straight forward with you. Where is the thing you promised to bring us? Gentlemen, don't worry. I assure you that I will... find the Qing Dynasty Emperor's jade stamp. The Qing Dynasty Emperor's jade stamp . is creme de la creme, indeed many wolfish thieves have their eyes on it. We will try out best to help the mighty Emperor reclaim Qing's territory, and the Great Britain... will also secretly provide assistance. These treacherous vassals never give a damn about the Qing Empire, so disgraceful! Wait till our empire reclaim the jade stamp and reform our army to rid the rebel, then the people all have the hearts for Emperor. Everyone will be well-rewarded. Wait till Qing regains its power, and will be able to represent China, to confirm the development project of provincial railroad system with the Great Britain Yeah... once the emperor reclaims power and territory, we mighty Qing and the British Empire, will definitely be brother states and can both enjoy prosperity. Ha... good, then just wait for my good news. Everyone please drink up. Uncle Tian, any news? No news yet Let me go look for him again Miao Ian, you stay here and rest, I will go with my sister. I can't let anything happen to Nan Sheng, let's go look together Hey... you can't come in here You have been searching all night, everyone tired? It's them. Gentleman, may I ask what the matter is? Looks like you don't know who's in charge here. That kid's safety, depends on your cooperation. My name is Guo Tian, what do you want? I am Yu Jie, just a little businessman. What I want is very simple, the Qing Dynasty Jade Stamp. But Ao Ge last night... Ting Ting, Tang Ao already took the jade stamp, and we're looking for him too. We have no idea where Tang Ao is. If you want hostage, just take me and let Nan Sheng go. Huh... Tang Ao is in my hands, but I can't get him to say anything no matter how I try. That's why I want to ask you all to find out where the jade stamp is. White-head, what are you gonna do to Ao Ge? You know how all of you martial arts people are so tough and stubborn. I just showed him a few moves, but I can't guarantee what will happen tomorrow. Dad, don't waste time talking to him, let's take action Zhen Nan Ha... Don't be reckless. Fine, let's see we die first or Tang Ao and his son? Yu! Hou De Town has its order, there's no way for you to behave atrociously. I already said that I'm just a businessman, everything is a trade. If you hand me the jade stamp, I give you back Tang Ao and the kid. But if you want to go hard, my guys... can also demolish this crappy store and look for the stamp ourselves. Yu Jie, how dare you? Hmm, eh, I am very busy and don't have time to mingle with you big shots. I don't care what you do, but you heard me, I'm giving you a day's time. Tomorrow at noon... Foreigners' Pier, I need to see the jade stamp, or else you wait to get Tang Ao and the kid's dead body. Water, water Water, water Now that you already caught Ao Ge, should just let the child go, he is innocent. I have my way of handling things. Last time you failed to complete the transaction at the pier, I already let it go. If you didn't catch Tang Ao, I would've sold your wife Listen, kill Tan Lu Sheng and his wife tonight. Also, when those people bring the jade stamp here tomorrow, tell all of our men to surround them. I want them in, but can't get out. Got it boss Lu Sheng, I just went to see a doctor, our baby is gone. I wanted to be a good wife, take good care of you and our child, but now I'm addicted to opium and killed our baby. I don't have the willpower to stay away from opium, and I don't want our child to be alone up in heaven, I also don't want to make you do anything against your conscience. Morality comes before everything else in Tan family, and you need to pass on this notion and Tan's Legs Twelve Ways. Lu Sheng, you are a hero, should use Tan's martial arts to save the country and the people. Our child and I will see you in heaven. Love, Wan Ting. Ah... Uncle Tian, what should we do now? I don't understand what they're going to do with the jade stamp? Al, that Yu Jie is conniving with the British, he's working for them. I have found out that in the past few months, Yu Jie frequently contacted people related to Qing. I'm guessing the British wants to corrupt those people in order to gain power in China and make profits. Another shoe-licking dog Ai, I'm really worried about Ao Ge's situation. But do we really hand them the jade stamp? If Yu Jie gets the stamp and gives it to the Qing government, the whole country will go back to a chaos again. It's almost time, I cannot demand Chin Woo Association to hand out the jade stamp for saving our family. Then the country will be in a bigger turmoil, more people will suffer. I, as a mother and wife, should just die with them. Eh, Miao Ian. Wu Ge, bring out the jade stamp Uncle Tian? Jade stamp is important, but Tang Ao is a big hero who is also a national treasure. I can't watch him die, so there's no other way but bring the jade stamp to see them. Wu Ge, tell the guys be ready. Yes Zhen Nan, Ting Ting help manage things here. Also, Wu Ge, you go to the pier right now to get all the details. I need to know all the routes from the piers. We're making a gamble, let's go. Thank you Uncle Tian Um The thing you want will be here soon Mr Yu, everyone is here Okay, Jack follow me. Who are you? What do you want? Don't come over Ignore it. Let's get drunk Sure Go in That thing I want? Give it, give the jade stamp to the guard. Where's Ao Ge and Nan Sheng? Lu Sheng and Wan Ting, too Where did you hide them? Haha... do you have a choice? Let me examine the jade stamp first, if it's real, you can reunite with Tang Ao and the kid. It really is the Qing Dynasty Jade Stamp, haha... Now you got the stamp, free the two Did I say I'd free them.? I only said you can reunited with them. What's happened? Jack, get them Miao Ian, go rescue them in jail, we will lead the way, go Okay - Did you miss daddy? - Yes. Good, daddy will teach you writing Hurry up... drive, quick, now Drive, drive, now! You, why are you here? You killed my wife, you traitor flunky, I won't let you take the jade stamp Go quick Ah... You want to find the Kung fu boy and kid? Beat me first! Brother, go Haha... whoever fighter, whatever martial arts, can't beat the speed of a bullet. Don't worry, go be with your wife in hell now - Are you okay? - I'm fine Thank you all so much for saving me. If I guess correctly, you're Twelve-Way-Tan-Legs... Tan Lu Sheng Twelve-Way-Tan-Legs Tan Lu Sheng, I have seen your fighting before, I know you're nothing ordinary. If I guess correctly, you must be Southern Sky, senior Guo Tian I am Guo Tian, we all are from Chin Woo Association I work for those foreign bastards, unworthy of being a part of Chin Woo You didn't want to. Now the most important thing is getting Ao Ge and his family out. Hmm Don't waste time, Zhen Nan, Ting Ting, go to the pier now and bring some guys to help Miao Ian. Yes, understand This trouble all started because of me, let me go tidy up the mess Okay Hmm Nan Sheng, Is me! Shooting Nan Sheng... Nan Sheng... Nan Sheng Hold up, don't die, daddy is here, Nan Sheng... Nan Sheng Daddy take you to the doctor, hold on tight, ah... Daddy still has to teach you how to write, write a lot of words, Nan Sheng... Sister, you can't go over there Go quick Don't go there
