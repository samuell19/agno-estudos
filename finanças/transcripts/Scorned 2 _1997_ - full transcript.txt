- All right? - I'll teach you everything I know. Are you okay? - Yes, it was just a bad dream. Amanda, you and I have been meeting each other for a while. I can say with certainty that you are You have experienced trauma in the past Shock like what? - Maybe you are the only one - Who knows what I do not know Violent dreams and blurred visions Whatever happens is repressed Subconscious Why? - To avoid pain, this is normal. I have patients who have been exposed For example, for childhood abuse They don't remember anything that happened In their life before the age of 10 years The human body has a mechanism Very strong defensive Hope that whatever It stays in place because I can't handle it This is the problem, the shock that They are usually suppressed Too strong to be forgotten permanently So it shapes itself in ways Different dreams - The valley is almost over. No, I am the one who should sleep What should i do now? What's next? I think we have to work hard Together, trying to remember what Happened when we get to this We will deal with it I hope so, well do you think That Mark is in his stake now? I think I think so Go visit him - I might do this. Thank you Robert But if my psychological behavior is not normal Generate distinct brain wave patterns Okay, so let's get back to what we were talking about A little while ago, you easier Remember... I have two slide images here Supports what we talked about With brain waves here as you can see How do heat patterns here relate What we talked about earlier Imagine this .. well that's all I have today And don't forget what I told you about Research papers, they are called research You have to specify your source, otherwise It will be called plagiarism Well get out of here, and who has Any questions about today's lecture Now is the right time We were wondering do you have it Office hours to come to help I postpone my work hours after class I will keep as long as you need is there anything else? Do you know what your class girls say about you? No thanks Well this is it As long as you stay on rent The room is the same since they disappeared Of course, I'm not sure Will we find something or not We thought he would be back now Hope anyway you like him Somewhere to go Is this what we are looking for? Anything out of the ordinary Alex took this to Ruby Amanda. Can i carry it He didn't seem to know he was going Is it good? - Impossible to say - As long as we're here, Mrs. Weston I'll come back later to take some shots To scan fingerprints? - I thought the police. I did it - I'll do it again. Hello, how was your day? - good - dinner is ready Smells nice, so what happened With Dr. Greenville? - It's all right, he thinks. That I experienced some trauma In the past and for this reason I see dreams - Really? - I think I would be more comfortable If my sessions start with you Again with Steve Robert - even if you like it - Morally I cannot, however There in the same building you can Also, it appears that Robert... Makes great progress, trust me Everything will be alright Now where did we have dinner? - Coming - Hello .. This is me - How are you? - Is there any news? - No trace of it, but I - I met Mr. Bender today But he was no longer sure of anything More than the police - Nowhere to go - Listen you've been wandering for a long time Isn't it time for you to go home? I can't now, Mister Binder He will meet everyone who has a relationship With Ruby at university so I think it's a good idea - But I feel - That we are pulling straws here That's all we have, Ruby is missing Nobody saw him for months And I don't know what to do? - Well calm down. We'll get over this I hope you come here Just several days I need you - I have to finish some things. in the office But I will try to go as quickly as possible Try more I know I wasn't the best person For companionship now As far as I am concerned, you are the only person I care about, with him It's just a bad day - Seems like I'm having bad days. Amanda, I love you. Hey, Robert Good, I want to talk to you What? - "Amanda" - Her health began to baffle her I was hoping to shed some light on it What do you know about her life before What i mentioned? - She was unfathomable as she told me - Do you know anything about her first husband? Failed, hooked, and I left him What is bothering you? I want to tell you that her behavior Strong trauma is suggested however When I ask her about her past Nothing seems out of the ordinary I never mentioned this to you before Because I wanted to see what I came up with from an idea But during my sessions with her it started I get the same result - I'm not sure. What do I do now but I want to say I'm seriously considering hypnosis Oh really? I think it's the next logical step. Mark she doesn't remember anything since she left Her ex-husband until she met you I am convinced that she is suppressing Strong shock during that time We have known each other for a long time I trust her frankness, and whatever it is decided It's her best As long as it's okay I'll support you Thank you for this Thank you, I'll go to class We'll talk later Dr. Greenfield, my name is Binder Private investigator, my parents assigned me "Student you have this class," said Robby Weston Do you remember the name? Sounds familiar, yeah. Do you have minutes to ask you? I was going to get me food Are you joining me? You don't have to have a cup of coffee We can talk about the road, the boy has disappeared His parents had not received a call from him for months Actually from time to time And religion can not bear to send their children To college and when it arrives And he decides that it is not for him He takes extended leave I do not think the case, did not collect his purposes Hear you probably have any records Or files can be viewed This guy is literally Disappeared and try anything and everything you know what? The last chapter subdued All of my students to describe myself In an article I was working on This may have something useful Wonderful, if we can look at it I am glad to show it to you Thank you, good dinner And if you read You will see what I'm talking about And it applies directly to Applied to Pavlov's "theory". It's true .. you know? I'm sorry I am not the center today Why not get out of here early? But I'll make up for this next time read on Mr. Vollind, would you go for a drink? I don't think that's respectful I mean a simple drink or a cup of coffee To wake up? - Very funny. I have free time to spend as long as you canceled early Amanda, I want to try something. During the next session and I want your position Under hypnosis? - Hypnotize? - Do you think this helps? - I'm not sure - But I want to try, what do you think of this? I don't know, Mark is praising you so much So whatever you think is the best Good. I'll see you later Okay, Cynthia, what prompted you to invite me to coffee? What do you mean? My lectures are analyzed She scored the highest in the last cards Nope I like your share But I couldn't achieve better grades in my last papers I think you're fair - Sorry, I didn't mean to - There is nothing wrong I'm usually hopeful from school but I really look forward To come to your class Maybe I should have given you higher scores I have to go home now As long as you mentioned it I need extra help with class I am very interested in it But your mind is moving fast And I'm having a hard time catching up You know my office watches I am happy to help you at any time. Can I accompany you to your car? It was nice talking with you I don't get a chance Getting to know all of my students I enjoyed it I am sure you have noticed many women In class they loved spending time with you It is true Can I call you Mark? This may sound strange to you And you might think I'm a little young woman But I hope to go dinner with you In another time Sorry, I have a lot of admiration for you Long time ago And I have to do something - Sylvia I think you are - Beautiful and attractive woman Even if I am not married You are my student and I cannot go beyond that I don't mean to make you uncomfortable And I know there are laws If you want a meeting Out of class I'll be open to this Otherwise, at least it should be taken off my chest Well, I appreciate your frankness But I don't think it's a good idea Well I'll see you tomorrow What do you do? - Just look, you're pretty today. Robert, tell me today he'll make me I go to sleep tomorrow Tell me this - and what do you think? - I think you are very attractive Come on, I'm serious I want to talk about this Whatever he decides is best for you I'll stand with him - But I'm scared. Than it will happen while I sleep This is a common fear Not something worth worrying about Hypnosis does not make you say anything Or do something you don't want It just clears your perception You are usually exposed to To talk about someone else It calms you down, and you'll be fine Hello- Can I help you? - Okay they go now and we can talk normally What are we talking about? - Sorry about yesterday - I was hoping for additional help today Well you can meet me at My office 10 minutes later Amanda, how do you feel? - Fine - Ready to start? - Yeah, well, I want you to remember. Every time I hit my finger, I will You are immediately released from hypnosis I want you to take slow deep breaths I'm looking for Marina Weston I come I told you I'd try - Happy to see you. This Mr. Bender told you about him - Alex West. Did you find anything? not much Nobody saw him in months How about the name we gave you? Nothing yet and I am still checking out the lists Frankly there is something strange In the disappearance of this woman She is attending her son's college Especially since it is hiding from the authorities She is a sick, manipulative woman who is capable of anything Well I do my best to arrange a meeting with one of her teachers From the last chapter called Robert Greenfield How about tomorrow? - good - Strangely, she did not realize It is capable of what you say by looking at the picture This is what we also felt Hi .. Okay, let's get into the matter This is exactly how I feel. I didn't come to study - We talked about it. what are you doing? Stop it I decided I want this more - I can't. Truman is "acting weird" - who is this? - My husband - You mean your ex? - Now gone, there are some people Who are the people? I don't see them and I don't know who they are People I know, there's a family and a boy Respect your mother, do you understand? My wife upstairs fell off Valium Again and my son hates me I'm afraid of you Fear of almost anything Amanda, I'm talking to you. Amanda"?" - What? What else? - I was in a coma, tell me what you saw I don't remember I have to go - No, no. I want you to calm down and stay here for a few minutes how was your day? - Okay, have your day? - I feel so much better now What's wrong with showing sympathy for my husband? - That's cool, but - Let's go to the bedroom? - No. Here How do you feel? - Exhausted, what happened to you? - I love you - I want to be perfect in every aspect, I know you suffered Of my problems for a long time - I didn't suffer because of you - Though I will work harder I want to make up for the last time Amanda, "Sit up"? - Not necessary. I'm sorry but I decided Cancel treatment with you - what? - I'm fine nobody is seeing anyone now I don't think this is wise I didn't expect you to understand but I did I made my mind up? Wait a minute, did you talk? With "Mark" on this? - Both - I will tell him tonight My dreams are gone, and I don't feel stressed Or distress now Amanda's "not a good idea that" Stop treatment at this point If you are not particularly satisfied with my treatment I will meet this but me I must insist on your completion Treat with another person, maybe a colleague of mine I feel comfortable with this I am really well You're not ready, after all. I made up my mind Thanks for help I will be happy to invite you to us for dinner one day Drink it You're pathetic, no wonder no one loves you anyway Mark, here, Robert, I'm calling you. For the 2:30 appointment I want to speak to you quickly If you can't meet me on the balcony In the student union Mister Binder came to see you - Mr Binder. This is Melina and Alice Weston That I told you about I don't know how I can help - Anything you tell us we will appreciate. Ruby was in a big seminar class. I taught her the previous semester Frankly I remember him vaguely but I made all the pupils that class They fill out a psychological test And I have the Ruby papers here - what are you saying? - Nothing is out of the ordinary The only thing worth mentioning Saying that he suffered from depression But this is not much and is common I can tell maybe he decided on a little vacation He would have told us if he was going A year ago we had a problem With our woman worker We think she is involved in his disappearance Any problem is this? She was charged with teaching him But she was blaming me On her husband's suicide and she was conspiring We'd all be killed, but when I got in The police disappeared from the scene And why do you think he trusts this woman? Because we suspect they are in a relationship. Dr. Greenfield I know it may not work Talk to all of its teachers But we just don't want to leave Any aspect without scrutiny We have taken enough of your time I gathered some information And a picture of her, if you see her Or you happened to see it in the future I appreciate you calling us Or by Mr. Binder Well I'll focus on my look - Thank you. I am sorry for that You have to see your way well I wasn't very focused - you might have to compensate me I'm new here, can you tell me where? Computer center? It's in the Harding Building, west of the campus Okay, walk from here Then you get over the square Then take the right with the big statue Would you repeat this? - Why isn't Eric better? - By the way, my name is Taylor. I'm Suzy. Class will not start until 15 minutes I know this just wanted to talk to you Good because I wanted to talk too about what? What happened yesterday was madness It can't happen again Why? Because I'm married Because you are my student, no reason from them More than enough on its own Let me say what I want to say My parents live in the city I will go vacation this week I was hoping we would meet The big house will be at our disposal Didn't you hear what I said? It's difficult when this is our relationship We cannot go home because of your wife And also my companion's residence is full And hotels are a cliché? - Stop it. "I'm not a teenager," said Cynthia I am sure that your companion He will be more than happy House game at your parents' house I get how it is You were taking advantage of me, naive little schoolgirl And now that you've got your pleasure You will throw me on the sidewalk No one will ignore me Lower your voice and calm down This was my mortal attraction I am taking drama lessons too. We will talk soon Well what we have here is Intercollegiate system messaging anyone At the university or anyone who is You just need an email address For example, Emily is Tepicino And Taylor is also a bad joke, getting into the system Includes tuition expenses You can also access the scores Every semester - do you have to be in university? - No, you can do this from anywhere All you need or login to the system The teachers do this all the time They score here And academic achievement until they come home They review these scores Can anyone access the scores? - You must have a password - Every member of the teaching staff And the students own that I'm trying to get to degrees here My friend Hayward, but I can't Because I don't know the password Interesting - can I show you something else? - No thanks, that's all I need Sorry, I have to go - Maybe you'd like a cup of coffee someday. maybe in another time This is my address, I want to see you tonight Wait a minute. - What? - I told you I wouldn't go to Your parents' house tonight or any other night But that is the issue You changed your mind felt you would This is you, I received your message Well, sit down, we have to talk what's going on? - Your wife came today and told me - She recovered and did not return Need to be treated You're kidding? - No. Bad idea for a woman in her condition End treatment now Trust me, I totally agree with you I am worried about her safety If she convinces herself that she is okay Did she really say that? I think those were exactly her words You have to talk to her, you have to know You might be hiding something I mean this can excessive behavior Be interpreted in many different ways But when you are into it Robert, I understand you. I hold the same certificate as you Yes of course, I'm sorry I cannot stress how dangerous this is for her This is the last thing I need right now Yesterday when I put her into hypnosis We got very close to knowing what happened - why didn't you tell me that? - Because I wanted to wait Until I get real results I don't know if yesterday had anything to do What happened today, but I can tell It was an emotional experience Robert .. do you have any suggestions? I made capricious decisions But she trusts you, if you talk, boil it She might change her mind and come back again I will do what I can Amanda? - Hey - what are you doing? - Just messing with the computer - We have to talk. about what? - I met Robert today. As I told you last night Things will be different here I don't need to go there Every morning, I made a wonderful dinner for you Just a couple of days ago you were seeing nightmares Full recovery does not come quickly I am not a doctor but I am I feel completely recovered Please come back to Robert Complete your treatment, I think it is important Well we will do what pleases you Won't you eat? - No, I'll just watch - I won't feel comfortable looking at me like this - Sorry, I didn't realize it. If you don't eat why don't you go back to work at the computer? are you sure? I'll take the bag now And take it back to the office Hey, Mark, that's me. Why are you calling me here? - I want you to come to my house I can't - I just want to talk. You go too far, this dialogue is over I will keep contacting you Until you come - Then I'll stop the phone. Then I will come to you myself We can continue this all night You don't know where I live You are registered in the directory, I just want to talk to you You're irrational - Your title. If you don't come in half an hour I will come by myself What? - I remembered - I forgot something at school - what is it? - I do research papers I don't remember where I left it but I think in school how long will you stay? - It depends - If you find it where you left it I'll be back right away and if I stay looking I might be late But don't worry I'll be back soon I come, let me get you a drink Will not stay long I have come to stop you from this idiocy Let's talk later I showered for you Come on, stop playing the silly But I said I came to speak This seems impossible. I love my wife Took a long time to find what you're looking for, right? Yeah, it wasn't in my office He was in the library - so I went to school. She lied to me, I followed you and saw your car outside her house She caught me? Listen, I stopped there, but nothing happened I saw you take a turn at your office This was only once Never Again - Do you love it? - Of course not, I don't know what happened to me I'm so sorry - Promise that it's over.

"I see," Mulder I'm on my way to have a coffee And I want to invite you this time I will meet you on the other side I was thinking, there are thousands of students They come to this college What is the likelihood that we will pass each other Twice in two days? - Maybe a slight chance - So it is destiny So, Taylor, do you have a wife? Or the mistress of what? - wife? - Of course not - how about a mistress? - Nothing heavy - you know? One of the reasons I'm here is that I have a ten o'clock class that ends - Then another class starts at the fourth This leaves me 3 hours With nothing to do with it And I was just thinking it'd be cool If I find someone who lives on the university site He doesn't mind resting in his room for several hours I can help you with that I feel tired now you have a beautiful house Thanks..I said something about taking a break This is the bed If you want, I'll be back shortly No, I am no longer tired I'm sorry about that. - You didn't tell me you had a mistress.

It's ridiculous - I agree with you, you have the right to die. Use your mind I haven't spent long talking with this guy but I'm in the realm of telling liars Just hours ago, I was swearing that he was telling the truth.
