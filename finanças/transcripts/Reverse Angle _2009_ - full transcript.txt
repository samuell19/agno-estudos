- And how's our committee member? - He's doing some pretty serious soul-searching. He's right on schedule to reversing his position on the big oil tax credit bill before next week's vote. - Good. What else? - My mole in the patent office red-flagged something. A car with no engine. The inventor was a well- respected MIT research scientist a few years ago. And he resigned his tenure and now he fell off the map. - A car with no engine doesn't need gas or oil to run. Do you know what happens to the Ameristake Oil and Gas Company if someone invents a car that runs without an engine? - I imagine it'd take a hell of a hit. - That's a bit of an understatement, Barrett. The company goes under, along with 20,000 jobs, retirement funds are compromised, political careers are jeopardized and most importantly, I lose a fortune. - I've already got my 2 best men on it. This thing will never see the light of day. - I don't want any loose ends on this, OK? It all gets erased: Invention, inventor, drawings, notes. Are we clear? - We're clear, sir. - Good, because if anything does show up, your best 2 men won't answer for it. You will. - Let's see what we got here. That's right. All right. Damn it. Why aren't you reading anything? Let's see. Now, there... That's more like it. Pegged you, you son of a bitch. Yeah. I'd classify that as a good morning. Yeah. Damn good morning. Morning, Janie! - Morning, Ned! - It's just junk. - Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Awfully cheerful for so early! Something tells me you got some mail that wasn't junk. - From your Alma Mater, Ned. I got it! Early admission to MIT! - Yes! - Ha! Ha! Ha! - Cambridge will never be the same. Hey! I've got some good news, too. Come on, I'll show you. - Where's Glen Pebble Road? - You passed it. - How far back? - You guys looking for Ned Larfield? - How'd you guess? - He's the only one who lives on Glen Pebble road. - So, what do you think, MIT? - I think it's fantastic, Ned. I mean, it's... it's gonna change everything. Does it really work? - You bet it does. - You know, the oil companies are gonna pay you a lot more to destroy this than anyone will to manufacture it. - Well it's a good thing I'm not after money then? - You better patent this quick. - I mailed my application to the patent office a couple months ago. No word yet. - Why don't you just do it on-line? All right. You know, maybe you should drive down there. I mean, this is way too important to let some geek bureaucrat screw it up. - I'm not worried about it. I mean, who else would be stupid enough to consider using paint as a solar conductor? Besides I've refined the process a dozen times since then. I filled out another application. Would you mind putting it in the mail for me? - Sure. - That's a good girl. I'm really proud of you, kid. - Ned, I don't know how I can ever thank you for all the... You're gonna knock 'em dead. - You better get going now. You'll be late for school. - Yeah. See you tomorrow morning? - Tomorrow morning, MIT. - That's him. Let's move in. - Hold on. Damn! TV crew. - What now? - We watch and wait. - Ned Larfield? Hi, I'm Eve Pretson, from KQAP News. I understand you've got something pretty special you'd want to show us. - Yeah. - It doesn't look like an uplink unit to me. - It's not. Whatever footage they took is still in that van. We deal with the TV crew first. Our inventor's not going anywhere. - Whoa! Buddy, come on. Jeez! What the... Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Dude! - You boys lost or something? - We're from the U.S. Patent Office. We'd like to talk to you about the application you recently filed. - Sure, let's go inside. - Excuse me. Can you tell me where I am? - Hey there! You forget something? - I guess I forgot a lot of things. - Damn! What happened to you? - I don't know. I can't remember. Do you know me? - Sure, yeah, we're old friends. - Who am I? - Look, I kind of got my hands full here. Just give me a minute. Ladies is back there if you want to clean up. I'll be right with you. - Thank you. - Who am I? Some ego on those TV people! - Why can't I remember anything? - You guys are back again, too. Find Ned's place all right? - Yeah, we found it just fine. - Hey, don't mess with that, all right? He ever, show you what he was working on? - No, no. He kept to himself. - What did you mean, we're back again too? - That woman was... - What the hell did you do that for? - He was a loose end. - What if that woman was our woman? She was here earlier. - She's dead. That grease monkey could've been talking about anybody. Let's get outta here. We already wasted enough time. It's the compressor. He was murdered and then robbed. - Lousy 200 bucks. Ouch! - 911. What's your emergency? Hello? Hello? 911. What's your emergency? - Hey, Percy! Where are you, man? - Are you unable to talk? - There is a balance to the universe. A balance that can be found in all the broad sweeping ideologies of mankind: War to peace, love to hate, good to bad, right to wrong. And finding that balance... well, it's not always easy. But I can promise you it's worth the effort. To empower doubt is to empower weakness. And contrary to popular belief The weak, they don't inherit the earth. They inherit 2 things: low self-esteem and low income. Hello. Yes, this is Doctor Griggs. - Sorry to bother you, We're having a little trouble with your credit card. - Really? I'm not sure why that happened, I'll be down in a few moments to straighten that out. - Great. Thank you. - Attaining wealth is like attaining anything else you want in life. It all starts with balance right here. - Can I get a ride? Thanks. - So, when does your seminar start? - Ten minutes. - Do you think it's a good idea to be drinking? - That's not drinking. It's... it's liquid courage. - Isn't your seminar about self-confidence and inner strength? - You bet. It comes in all forms. - She's been getting speeding tickets for this segment called, "License, Registration and Phone Number Please." - I love her pieces. Have you ever seen them? - Speeding tickets are a part of life for Americans, especially those with heavy feet... - Um, yeah. Yeah, I'm very familiar with her work. -During a routine traffic stop. Pennsylvania State Trooper James Slade was doing his own version of profiling. That is, if you're young, female, driving a few miles over the speed limit and westbound, chances are Trooper Slade pulled you over. Those women who provided their phone numbers got off with a warning. Other women, including this reporter, who did not cooperate with Trooper Slade's request, got speeding citations with the highest dollar fine allowed. There you have it. To the list of My Space and Face Book you can now add Officer Slade's stretch of route 322 for hot spots to meet hotties. This is Eve Pretson for KQAP's News at 5:00. -Thanks, Eve... - What I tell you? She's great. - Yeah, she's just wonderful. Because to empower doubt is to empower weakness. And contrary to popular belief, folks, the weak don't inherit the earth. They inherit 2 things. One, low self-esteem. Two, even lower income. If you were searching for firewood, would you go searchin' for it on the streets of Philadelphia? Or Boston? New York? The answer to that is no. I wanna hear you say it: "No". - No. Louder like you mean it. - No. - With some confidence! No! - No! - That's right! And similarly, when you go searching for wealth you do not go searching for it among the poor. Because attaining wealth is like attaining anything else you want in life and it all starts with balance right here. I want you to picture with me. Close your eyes. Put your hands on your temple, your two fingers, both hands, and I want you to picture a river. A fast-flowing river and you throw a stick in that river and the current takes it wherever the river is going. Now I want you to picture what you want in life. Do you want money? Do you want power? Do you want love? Picture that as the river and you are the stick. And balance of the mind will give you the confidence, the power to throw yourself into that river and ride the current to success. Because if you're unhappy with your life, I am here to tell you that you have the power to change it. - Yes! - Thanks for the ride. - Man, I can't wait to get back to DC. What time is our flight in the morning? - Early. Too early. - OK, that's one room, one night. Two queen beds - Thank you. Can you get someone to return our rental, please? We have an early flight. - I'll be happy to take care of that for you. - Thank you - Good night. Dr. Griggs! Could you stop at the desk, please? - Just gotta get in the car, thanks. - Doctor Griggs? - You! No comment. - I need to talk to you! - No comment. - I, Sorry. I'm not interested, thank you. - I need to talk to you! - Whoa! Watch it. - Hey! - Can we, um, set up an appointment? Thanks. - Hey! - I need to talk to you. Please, help me! Please I need your help! - Stop following me. - I need to talk to you. - I have nothing to say. Go back to... - Why do I have your card? - I'm not listening. Go back in the hotel. - I need your help! How did I get your card? Please! My God! Drive! - What? - Drive! Drive! - Now what? The money's already been wired. We've already been paid. - Relax. Technically we did our job. We took out the old man and destroyed the evidence. She won't be hard to find. - Let's get the keys. - Who are those guys? - They want to kill me! - Yeah, I noticed. Why? - I don't know! I don't know who I am! - What you talking about? - I can't remember anything! I... I saw those guys earlier, but I have no idea why they want to kill me. - I knew you were obnoxious, but I never knew you were dangerous. - So you do know me? - You really don't remember anything, do you? - So why was I meeting you at 7:00 o'clock tonight? - You weren't meeting me at 7:00. I had a seminar that started then. - Then how did I get your card? - I have no idea. Hi. - Hi, guys. What can I get you? - I will have a beer. And what are you gonna have? Make that two beers. - You got it. I'll be right over. - Thanks. - Thank you. - No, no. Don't thank me yet. Ordering drinks for dates has never been my strong suit. - Am I a date? - I should be so lucky. So what do you remember? - Nothing. - Nothing? Not even your name? Nothing? - No. I... It's as if I was... born on the side of a mountain this morning. You sure we don't know each other? I... I get the feeling that there's some sort of history or something. - Um, history? No. Um, not really a history. - But you know me? - I mean a lot of people know you. They know who you are. You're, um, kind of a celebrity. - I'm a celebrity? - Yeah, I mean, you do these news reports on TV. - Do you think those men wanna kill me because of something I reported on? - It's possible. I gotta be honest here with you. Um, the stuff you do, It's not all that hard hitting. - What do you mean? - You specialized in lighter pieces meant to mess up people's lives. Like the cop who was trying to pick up a girl at a traffic stop or a horny husband trying to work phone sex into his monthly budget. Or, an honest business men trying to inspire people to better their lives. - That sounds pretty bleak. - Um... What do you do for a living, Dr. Griggs? - I'm an honest business man trying to inspire people to better their lives. - No. - Yes. - These are on the house, compliments of Seth over there. He said he's a big fan of yours, and anytime you want to do a piece on hot bartenders, he's your man. - Thank you. He's married with 2 kids. - If he wants an autograph, your name is Eve Pretson. And I think we know each other well enough for you to call me Harry. - Did I ruin your life, Harry? - My piece hasn't aired yet. Go on, drink up. - I don't even remember if I... I drink. I guess I do. - That's not drinking. Tequila is drinking. Your turn. - Okay. - Now tequila and lemon. - Just like riding a bike? - Let's throw it over to field reporter Eve Pretson on location with an un likely gang of desirable undesirables. - Today I'm with the cheerleading squad of Springfield High School. They're returning champions to this weekend's state cheerleader finals to defend their title. Trouble is, these girls have had coaches this season. All 3 have resigned. According to many in the high school community, including faculty, students, and parents, these Pom-pom Prima Donnas have taken over the school through intimidation tactics. - Pom-pom Prima Donnas! That's great! Where do you come up with that stuff? - Just think what I could do with a real assignment. - Are you kidding? You're fantastic at this. Your ratings are through the roof. - I want a shot at a desk, Bob. - Everybody pays their dues, Eve. You know that. Just be patient. - Is that what this affair is? My dues? - You knew what the deal was when we started this. We're not hurting anyone here. We're just having fun. - It was fun when the lies were just about your marriage. But you told me that you'd... - Hey! I know what I told you, OK? - No, it's not OK, Bob. Promises were made. You led me into this relationship with the understanding that you'd give me the opportunity to separate myself from the other pretty faces on camera. - What are you saying? You're the most popular field reporter we have. That's gotta count for something, doesn't it? - I don't want to be popular. I want a desk. - Nobody gets a desk if they're not popular. - Nobody gets a desk unless they're taken seriously. And nobody will take me seriously interviewing cheerleaders. If you're not gonna do what you said you would, you need to tell me. The shelf life for journalists is a lot shorter for women than it is for men. - OK. What if I gave you a piece down at City Hall? Would that make me a little more fun to be with? - Maybe. When? - Tomorrow. We'll talk about it in the office and figure it out. I gotta go. I'm late for Linda's birthday party. OK? I promise. - One new voicemail. - Hi, Eve. Dan Hollanbeck with KXUT in New York. Hey, we really enjoyed the material you sent in. Great stuff, but it's a little too soft for what we're looking for. We've decided to go in another direction for the weekend anchor spot. Best of luck, though. - I remember! I remember who I am! I... I'm Eve Pretson from KQAP! - I thought alcohol was supposed to have the opposite effect. - No, I remember drinking this very stuff. It's tequila right? I don't really like it, but my... Bob does. - Who's Bob? - My boy... My boss, I think. Um, do you remember anything else? Like who's trying to kill you? - No. Just that one memory popped into my head. - Maybe another shot will do the trick. Seth! - Hey Margo, have we heard anything from Eve yet? - Nothing from her or Al. - Did you try her cell? - All day. No answer. You don't think anything happened? - What could happen? They're probably shacked up in a Holiday Inn running up the expense account. I hate it when she does this. - Does what, Bob? - Tries to make a point on company time. Now, if she calls, tell her I want to see her first thing in the morning. - Sure thing. Bob! - Yeah? - A friend of mine at KXUT in New York tells me Eve made a run at their weekend anchor spot. Apparently she came up a little light. - Is that right? - Just thought you ought to know. - Yeah. - Have a good night. - Yep. - Bye! - So you remember your car going over the cliff and climbing out of it? - No, I assume I was in it. I... Maybe it was my car. And these guys, you saw them kill somebody at a gas station? - No I... I came out of the bathroom and he was crushed under the car. It was horrible. - So maybe they want to kill you because you're a witness. - They didn't see me at the gas station. - If they don't know you're a witness then they want to kill you for another reason. - Yes! No. I don't know. - Eve, just go to the police. - I'm afraid to. There was a police officer at the gas station and I hid from him. I don't know why. It was just a feeling. And it's like he was after me or something, like those killers. I got confused. I came looking for you. Your card was all I had. - Well, I think it's amazing you actually found me. - Maybe my journalistic instincts kicked in. What I don't get is how they found me at the hotel. - They could've followed you. - But I hitched a ride in a truck And why not shoot me before I go inside? It makes no sense. I'm sorry I got you into this, Harry. I know I have no right to ask, but can you please help me find the station where I work? - Of course, but what if... - What if they beat me to it? - I mean, you said it yourself they found you at the hotel. - The only way I survive this is to find answers. Who they are, why they want to kill me, who I am, what I did, who I know. I've gotta start somewhere. Right now it's all I've got. - For what it's worth, you got me too. All right, let's see if we can find out some dirty little secrets about Eve Pretson. - So these reports are meant to ruin people? - No, maybe not ruin people. I they're meant to just expose people for what they are. You know, like con men and... just taking advantage of people who are less fortunate than them. - Then why would people let me interview them? - They don't. You follow them around with a hidden camera and catch them doing their thing, and when they... when you think you got enough footage then you just confront them right on camera. - So then it was a good thing? - I guess. For the most part, yeah. I mean it's popular anyway. - Are you a con man, Harry? - No. No, I give seminars on the power of positive thinking. I really helped a lot of people. - Then why did I think what you were doing was bad? - I don't know. - Well, what did I say when I confronted you? - Um, I don't... I don't really remember. - You don't remember? How can you not? You must remember! - Because I just don't remember. Can we leave this? - Why are you getting mad? - I'm not! You see, this is the way you handle your interviews. You get in people's faces, then you twist their words around, make it seem like they're lying to you or they're trying to cheat you, but I'm not trying to cheat you. Wanna know what the difference is between what we do? I try to help people better their lives, using balance, trying to raise their self-confidence, you just use people to better your own life. That's it. - Wait! No, no, no, no, no. That... That's it! I must have done something to piss someone off. - That's a pretty safe bet. - The men that are trying to kill us. I must have reported on something. Something bad. Something, something really bad. - Eve, your reports aren't like that. You know, I'm pretty pissed off about the report you're doing on me, but it doesn't make me wanna kill you. - Wow. I must be a real jerk. - No. No, you're not. - If... if I did what you said, if you were helping people and I messed that up for you... - Can we just forget it, OK? You were just doing your job. All right? - How do we get in? - You're the talent. Security guards always recognize talent, right. - I don't know what we're gonna find in there, but by the sounds of it, it's not gonna be pretty. - If it helps get your memory back, it's fine by me. - Harry I don't know how to thank you for helping me. And I don't mean by just getting me here, I mean by making me feel like there's an end worth finding. Thank you. - Wow! - What? - You! It's like you're not even the same person. Yeah, you got the same hair and the same eyes and the same beautiful lips, but the person that I know on television, that person... I can't even imagine the words "thank" and "you" coming out of her mouth in the same sentence. - Now I'm thinking that I shouldn't go in there and discover whatever it is I did or who I am. - Let's make a deal. Whatever we find in there, that's just something we did. It's not who we are. Deal? - OK. - Let's go. - Thanks. - Good evening, Miss Pretson. Here for some late night editing? - I am. Is that alright? - Sure thing. I'll buzz you in. - Thanks - Look familiar? - No. All right, Let's find your desk. There it is. - Wow! OK. Password? - Any ideas? Um... Do you believe in fate, Harry? - If I don't I should. - OK, according to this, these are reports that have already been completed and have aired. This one's called "License, Registration and Phone Number Please". Speeding tickets are a part of life for Americans, especially those with heavy feet. But some lead foot drivers got off easy recently. During a routine traffic stop, Pennsylvania State... That's the cop that I saw earlier at the gas station. Maybe he was there looking for me. Maybe he's working with the killers. - That guy looks like he does his own dirty work. Plus, Eve, I saw this spot. I think you probably helped him with the ladies. "Pom-pom Prima Donnas"? These Pom-pom Prima Donnas have taken over the school through intimidation tactics. These are embarrassing. - Pom-pom Prima Donnas. Good title. - No, I remember this one. This was playing in the background during an argument with my boss about my career. - Were you defending it? - Thankfully no. I think I was complaining about having to do it. - It's just a job. It doesn't define who you are. - What if it does? What if all I am is what's loaded into these pitiful stories? - I don't know anything about your life. But the woman that I see sitting right in front of me now is not the woman in those segments. - You make me wanna take your seminar. - Yeah? Why don't you call up what you're still working on? Yep, that one right there. - "The Doctor of Balance"? Credit card debt piling up? Car payment overdue? Can't afford that rising-arm interest rate? Now you can make it all go away through the power of balancing the mind. So says Dr. Harry Griggs, master motivator. But motivator of what? Be it senior citizens on fixed incomes or people eyeball deep in debt, the dubious doctor never met a desperate audience he couldn't convince to dig a little deeper into debt for the promise of mind-bending powers to attract wealth simply by thinking it. Is this true? Do you target people who are desperate for money and put them deeper in debt by exploiting them? - No, I offer hope to people who need it. - At what price? You know what? I... I don't wanna look at this anymore. I mean, there's nothing here that would warrant murder. These are my keys. - That means someone else was driving the car. - Somebody was driving. There's gotta be something else. These are my bills. That's my home address. - I know where that is. Let's go. - There's 219 right there. You just passed it. - Yeah, I know. I just don't think it's a good idea to park out front, given the circumstances. We'll park up there. - OK. - You know this amnesia thing could be a blessing in disguise. - Yeah? How's that? - Well, I could reinvent myself. Only do interviews that are positive and inspiring, like you. - Yikes, you will bore your audience to sleep. Who cares? I can't remember any of them anyway. - Um, I thought you might be hungry. - Yeah, I'm starving. It looks great, what is it? Eggs and stuff. You know, my dad always said in order to make a really great breakfast, you might find yourself staying the night. - OK, you just lost all your inspiration points. - You telling me my dad was wrong. If you wanna change. I'll lend you something. This is great. I have to admit your father must have been on to something. - Yeah and he was also a used car salesman that could sell ice to Eskimos, so you know, a grain of salt. - Well, that explains your gift with words. But not your choice of product. - What are trying to say? - Well, you sell hope instead of used cars. - Larger target base. Not everybody needs a used car. - Are you gonna charge me, Harry? - For what? - Hope. You gave me hope and it doesn't seem fair to sell it to everyone else and give it to me for free. Let's see how many memories this computer holds, shall we? - Isn't this sweatshirt a little large for you? - It's was my... Dad! Dad, guess what I won? - A million dollars? - I got honourable mention in the essay contest at school today! - You didn't get anything. - Yes, I did! Look, it says it right here. - Why'd you do that? - Because it says you lost. What do want from a piece of paper that constantly reminds you that you didn't come in first? - That's not what it said, Dad. That's exactly what it said. You lost. Is that how you're gonna live your life, Eve? Happy to lose? Proud to cry? You better toughen up, little girl. Life is hard and nobody's gonna give you anything. You take what you want and you don't let anybody get in your way. You understand me? Good girl. Discipline, Eve. Determination and discipline. You build your life around those principles and there's nothing you can't do. - Eve? Eve, you all right? - Yeah. - Good. You were just telling me who this fabulously large sweatshirt belongs to and then you zoned out. - It was my father's. I... I had this flash of memory. He was a Marine. He's dead now. - I'm sorry. Um, do you remember anything else? - No, I just remembered seeing him in it and it made me wonder why I kept it. - Did you like him? - Like? I don't know how to answer that. I'm sure I loved him. He was a proud man who undoubtedly made me what I am today. - No, not today. Maybe he made you what you were yesterday, but not today. - You know, I don't understand how I can get these isolated flashes of memory and then not remember anything else. - Yeah, I know. The brain's funny that way, isn't it? It's like something simple, like a smell, can trigger a memory that you just can't recall any other way. Did that trigger anything? - I'm remembering how I wanted you to kiss me at the station. - Like that? - Looks like somebody's home. ♪♪My eyes are closed ♪ ♪ But I can hear your breathing ♪ ♪ I feel you are a creation of my mind ♪ ♪ You're outside of the fog ♪ ♪ I shiver as you softly blow on my skin ♪ ♪ I was sinking in icy waters ♪ ♪ I had sabotaged my whole life ♪ ♪ Will you be there when I open up my eyes? ♪ ♪ Is this moment real? ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ - What's with that damn dog? - Just ignore him, he always does that when... Wait a minute. - What? - Somebody's here. - What? The dog barks when somebody's here. Get your stuff. Go, go. Get your stuff in the car. Let's go. - They're gone. - No, they're not. You hear that dog barking? - Any ideas? - Well, she survived the crash. Maybe the camera did too. - Eve, we've got to go to the police on this. - No, I can't! For all I know those guys are cops! - These guys are gonna kill us. - What can the police do? I don't know how to answer any questions about who they are or why they want to kill me. - The police can protect you. - No, I don't believe that! It would a hell of a lot easier for them to find us under police protection. You're the only one I can trust right now! - You're serious? OK. We do this alone. Are you sure you that you cannot remember those guys in suits and the guns anytime at all before the gas station? - I told you, no. I... I climbed up the cliff and walked to the gas... Wait a minute! I do remember something. I remember the 2 guys looking over the cliff down at the burning car, and... I couldn't see their faces, but they had guns. - That's it. That that's gotta be it. They saw you then and they followed you since. - Why didn't they just kill me then? - I don't know. - No, I doubt it. It had something to do with the crash. It wasn't you. - No. What? What are you taking about? - Your business card! I... I didn't get it from you. My business card? - That seminar is actually at 7:00 o'clock tonight at the Airport Hotel. And I wrote all the information on the back of the card. - Thanks Pam. - So are you gonna do that hidden-camera thing again? - That's the plan. I think I have enough footage already, but I wanna get his reaction when I bust him on the $25 Ph.D. certificate in front of his group of gullible idiots. - Sweet! And Mr. Hoffman stepped in a few minutes ago. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hi. - Hi. - That looked a little too friendly. - Don't get paranoid on me, all right? Just walk with me. There's a nut job who lives halfway across the state, all right? This is some kind of inventor. His place looks like a junk yard. All kinds of weird contraptions. Anyway, I want you to do a piece on him, like the Rube Goldberg thing. You know, eccentric toiling away in solitude, building a better mousetrap for humanity, blah, blah, blah. I need a filler piece to close out the Friday 5:00 PM news, OK? Something light and funny. - What happened to City Hall? - City Hall's not going anywhere. This is something I need now. - You lied to me, Bob! - I didn't lie to you, Eve. I told you what you wanted to hear. There's a difference. - Really? Well, I didn't lie to you about being a great lover. I told you what you wanted to hear. - Don't bust my chops this early. I was late last night getting home. Linda al... Do your job, Eve. All right? Al's waiting for you down at the motor pool. - Bob, you can order me to do any piece you want. You're my boss, I get that. And as far as sleeping with you goes, I'm a big girl. I can handle the consequences. But don't think for a second that walking into the men's bathroom is gonna shut me down. - Are you finished? - Yes, I am. - Good. Then would you please go make this guy look like a crackpot? Something everyone can laugh at over beers at the corner bar on Friday night. You know the drill. Nobody humiliates better than you. - This doesn't mean City Hall is off the table. What about CBS anchor Connie Chung? - What about Connie Chung? - She never did this crap! She went straight from college to a local desk job. - Well, let's see, she was beautiful, exotic and smart as hell - Are you saying I'm not exotic? God, I've gotta stop drinking so much coffee. - Maybe she slept with the news director at her station. What is bugging you this morning? - We were supposed to meet for drinks last night. - Well, I'm sorry. I was going over a piece about City Hall with Bob. It couldn't be helped. - Yeah, I'm sure you were going over a piece. Finish fixing your hair and break out your hatchet. Three, two, one. - I'm Eve Pretson with KQAP News at the home of inventor Ned Larfield, who is on a quest to build a better mousetrap. - Actually, I'm more concerned with global warning than mousetraps. - And why is that? - Well... - Doesn't global warming effect mice too? - Yes, ma'am, it sure does... - Perhaps you could have a look at some of your inventions? This one looks fascinating. What does it do? Well, now, um... This isn't a working prototype. It's a physical model used to give proximity to variables in solar calibrations. - I see! How do you drive it without wheels? - Well, it's not designed to drive. A car not designed to drive? What a novel idea. - N-n-now, don't look at this like it's a car in the context of today's conception of what a car is. Think of it as a horse-drawn wagon before the automobile as we know it was invented. - Okay, I'll go with that. - You see, horsepower in an engine comes from the idea of power generated by horses. One horse pulling a wagon was one horsepower. Four horses pulling a wagon was four horsepower... - And 350 horses pulling a wagon would be 350 horsepower? - Yes. I mean, 350 horses pulling a wagon isn't practical, but the P.R.C., the power ratio construct certainly is. - OK, but don't you need wheels no matter how many horses you use? - Wheels? I see. You're still thinking of this as a car. This isn't a car. - It's not? - No. No, it's a... No! It's a concept. Like the horse-drawn wagon was a concept for the horseless wagon. See you have to think of these large panels as horses. - OK, what kind of horses, Ned? - The kind of horses don't matter. It's just the representational value I'm equating the panels to in terms of creating energy for an automobile. It's not feasible for 350 horses to pull a wagon, now is it? - I wouldn't think so. - That's the concept I'm working with. You see, internal-combustion engines are big and clumsy. They waste a lot of energy just carrying their own weight. Here, let me show you something. I have a better example of how that mass-to-energy distribution ratio works over here. - What's this over here, Ned? That's nothing. It's just junk. Never even made it to prototype. I, I think you'll find this device over here quite fascinating and a little sexy. This way. Th-th-this way, camera guy. - Watch the news on Friday evening and you'll see yourself on television. - I don't own a television. - That's great. Once I edit out all that technical mambo-jumbo, this guy gonna be solid gold. My god! Al is dead. He must have died in the crash! - Um, it sounds like a miracle that you didn't. - We must have shot something out there we weren't suppose to, but I have no ideas what it was. We have to find that place, Harry! - OK. - We have to talk to Ned and find out what it was! - OK. Do you remember how to get there? - No, I... Let's find a coffee shop with internet access. - OK. Here you go. - Thanks. Listen to this: "MIT professor and research scientist Ned Larfield "resigned from his tenured position to retire in seclusion "after his research partner, Steven Blakely, was killed in "a freak automobile accident." It goes on with some gory details, but it looks like they partner were working on alternatives to combustible engines to combat global warming before it was fashionable. - Not threatening to anyone. - Except gas and oil companies. I don't think his partner's accident was any freakier than mine. We need to find Ned Larfield's place. - We're in luck. Finding people is my field of expertise. - My god! They killed him! - Along with everything else. Al and I were just here yesterday. I remember it all! His crazy inventions... - Don't. It's not safe. If they come back while we're down there, we're sitting ducks. This place is in the middle of nowhere. - Two dead research scientists, secret inventions, hit men, car chases, a murdered cameraman. There's a hell of a story out here. Hell, it's even chasing me and I can't find it. Some journalist. - Being a little hard on yourself, aren't you? You didn't even know your name a day ago. - We both know what kind of a journalist I am. Let's go back to Philly. Do you see someone? - No, it's just I don't want any surprises. That's all. - Harry, you know, I'd be dead right now if it wasn't for you. - I'm not so sure it's not the other way around. - Sorry I got you into this. When we get back to Philly, we should go our separate ways. They're not after you. I appreciate that, but I think I'm gonna stick around a little longer, OK? Beside I'm a doctor, remember? You've had a nasty head injury. I need to keep you under observation. - My god! - What is it? - Can I help you? - You can fill it with regular and point me towards the ladies room. - There at the back. Key's in the office on the wall. - Thanks. What's the matter? - It's not right. You know that, don't you? - Aw, jeez, Al, are you still pissed about last night? - I'm talking about Ned Larfield. He's not a Pom-pom Primadonna. He's an old man trying to make a difference. If you ask me, he should be taken seriously. - Come on! You saw what he was putting together. I half expected to see hamsters under one of the hoods. - Some journalist you are. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? What you did out there isn't journalism. It's offensive. What you plan on doing in the editing room is criminal. - I was given an assignment. My job is to give my boss what he wants. - Yeah, you're real good at that. - Screw you, Al! - No thanks. You're dance card's a little too full for my taste. - I guess that means I'm looking for another cameraman. - That's fine with me. I'd rather shoot weddings than watch you pretend to be a journalist! - You want the receipt? - Give it to the jackass in the bathroom. Screw you. I can edit this myself. Al's still alive! - Police are still baffled by what they're calling a mob-style homicide. Former MIT Professor Ned Larfield was found dead at his home yesterday. He was shot twice in the head execution-style and his compound was incinerated. There are currently no suspects. In an unrelated story, police raided... - Bob Hoffman. Eve! Where the hell are you? - I'm driving back to Philly. I need to talk to Al now - Forget it! He's not here. What the hell is going? - Look, I can't explain anything right now. I need to get a hold of Al now! - You need to give me answers. The nut job got killed yesterday. Did you even know that? - Yeah, I do now! - Where's the footage? What the hell were you doing out there? - You know what? Don't even go there. - What do you want me to think? People are dying there and my cameraman and reporter have nothing. Did you even talk to the guy? - Yes, we got an interview, but I can't say anything right now! I need to get a hold of Al first. He could be dead! - He's not dead. - How do you know? - He left a message for you this morning. - What did it say? - "I'm sorry. Call me". What the hell were you two doing out there? - Where the hell is that other body? - Well, maybe an animal ate it. Nice. What have we here? - What you got? - You have 5 new messages. - First message received yesterday at 12:01 pm. - All right, Eve. I'm sorry I didn't mean it, I was just jealous, OK? Now get your lovely ass back down here to this godforsaken gas station and pick me up. And you can't edit without me. I pulled the P2. - That means the woman, the cameraman and the footage are all still out there. Let's go. Let's go. - Hello? Eve! What the hell is going on? - Al! Thank God you're OK! Where are you? - I was hiding out in a cheap motel after I heard someone killed Ned Larfield. I freaked when I couldn't get you on your cell. - They tried to kill me too. They got the cell and the camera, but missed me. I think we shot something that we weren't supposed to. - No, they didn't get the footage. I got the P2 right here. In this digital age, a good cameraman always pockets his footage. Where are you now? - I'm on my way to the bus station. Got a ping on his cell phone. Triangulating... it's about 20 miles from here. - We'll meet you at the bus station. Bring the P2 card. - He's heading west. - Al! - I thought they got you. - You have the P2 card? - Yeah. - Hi. Harry. - Al. - Hi. - Thank you. - solar calibrations... -I see! Um, how do you drive it without wheels? - Well, it's not designed to drive. - A car not designed to drive What a novel idea! This can't be it. What's this over here, Ned? - That... that's nothing. It's just junk. Never even made it to prototype. I think you'll find this device over here quite... - He was awful weird about that piece. - and a little sexy. - Look at that. The car. Is that all we have? - No, I shot some other stuff. - Look at all that junk! Wait, are those solar panels on the hood? - Do you have anything else from inside the tent? - Yeah. Wires, meters, more wires. All looks the same to me. - It's gotta have something to do with that car. Wait a minute! What... what did he say earlier? - It's a concept. Like the horse-drawn wagon was a concept for the horseless wagon. See you have to think of these large panels as horses. - He was talking about horsepower. Those panels supply power to the car. - But he said it wasn't designed to drive. - But this one was. - That... that's nothing. It's just junk. Never even made it to prototype. - Sure as hell looks like a prototype to me. - this device over... - That's it. It has to be. Look at how he's hiding it. - and a little sexy. This way. - Look at the paint. Large silver patches in the exact same location as the panels on the other car. It's the paint. - What? - Look at the way the light hits the paint. You see it? - Yeah, it's weird. - The panels are horses. My god, it's solar! I think he invented a paint that acts as a solar panel. - Is that possible? - Listen, everything was impossible until someone did it for the first time. Watch out! - Come on. - Go! - What do we do now? - You wouldn't object to police intervention now, would you? - No. I welcome it. - Come here. - If I can get a strong enough signal, I can send this P2 clip to the station. - Are you crazy? Harry, his is important. They killed Ned Larfield and that poor man at the gas station to keep this thing quiet. If I can't honour that, then I'm a fraud. The signal is too weak. We need to get closer. - We've got company on foot. All right, Here's the plan. I'm gonna head that way and draw their attention so you can get closer and do your reporter thing. - Harry, I don't know if this story's worth dying for. - You are. - Did you see the girl? - No, but I'm sure they're still here. - Yes! OK. - Hey, tough guy, where's your girlfriend? - Are you all right? - I've been better. Did you send it? - I don't know if it went through. - Too bad. - Are you two alright? Man down, man down. - It's been said that genius is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration. If that's true, then Ned Larfield spent a lifetime sweating to make this world a better, cleaner, safer place for all of us. And what did it get him? I'm standing here on the burned-out area that used to be Ned Larfield's compound. The MIT professor and research scientist was murdered here a few days ago by a pair of hired killers. Hired by whom, we may never know, for the veils of corporate secrecy run thick and are guarded well. Some speculate that the motive for the killings was Larfield's invention of an alternative energy. All known evidence of this invention was thought to be destroyed. Although Larfield had claimed that he filed patent applications for all his work, the U.S. Patent Office indicates that there is no record of such an application by Larfield. I had a chance to spend time with this brilliant man just a few hours before he was killed and during that time, Ned Larfield revealed a side to human nature that changed this reporter's life for the better. - Like most everybody, there's nothing I like more than the sound of a finely-tuned engine. And I'll be the first to admit that, gallon for gallon, gasoline is the hands-down queen of all liquid fuels. But the fact of the matter is, if you stand inside a closed garage with any internal-combustion engine running, it will kill you. Now, consider the earth and its atmosphere a huge, closed garage. You get the same result. - We may never know what Ned Larfield discovered out here on his isolated farm. But it's clear that in these troubled times that this world needs more people like Ned. People who aren't afraid to fight for what's right, no matter what the cost, and in doing so, inspiring others to do the same. This is one reporter so inspired. Eve Pretson with KQAP News. - Well, don't forget your cameraman when the offers start flooding in. - Not a chance, partner. - Nice! That sounded like you were picking a fight. - I hope so. - Let's go back to the station. I have a little editing to do on a piece called "The Doctor of Balance." - I've got a new title for that one: "The Doctor of No Balance". Closed captions: Vision Globale
