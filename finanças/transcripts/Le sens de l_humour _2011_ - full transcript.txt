Le sens de l'humour - 1h50 - Com?die - 2011 What's this? Quail. What? Quail. What? Lil' chicken. What's that? Grape, Dad. Why? Well... A grape on a chicken? Stupid! I don't deserve this! You're empty-headed! Why you slouching? Stand up straight! You're stiff as a board. You look so awkward! Stop fidgeting! Stop obeying me!! Go clean up! Remy Lafrance, University of Montreal professor, author of "The Dim-Witted People," was last seen here. The hardest part is not knowing? Yes... But... I'd like to say... if he's still alive... could they send me... a finger or an ear... so I'd know. Thanks. It's... Whatch a doing? I'll hitchhike. Get your stuff. It's raining. Go away. Damn, we're gonna have fun. Good evening, Val-d'Or! Any singles here? Your name, sir? Say, "Hi, Rubens" Good evening. Doing good? Don't give a shit. Birthdays, huh? More self-delusional bullshit. Why give someone a gift to celebrate him not dying?! Wanna surprise me on my birthday? Stay home and shut the fuck up. With me, you're sure to come. 30 minutes, or it's free. With Robert... 2 minutes, you want a refund. I'd take anyone at this point... even Robert. With your different comedic stylings, it's strange you're touring together. We have the same manager. An imbecile. You're his caseworker, right? Can't let these beasts roam free... it's dangerous! Unless you're skiing with a ball. People have too many expectations. People expect too much. Some even run with it. Some even run with it. Wait up! My Pass! Politicians always complicate everything. A curvy banana isn't "curvy"! It's the fruit of a centralized tangent within an external constitution ensuring the protection of a healthy internal product. It's a fuckin' curvy banana. He's good. Please... You really made my night... tonight. What a great crowd. You're... Thanks. Bravo, Serge. My blood! One of the best evenings of my life. I'm really touched. Kudos to you. Alphonse, great! Been doing this 16 years. I've never had... Marco! Marco! A Sense of Humor Carole-Anne! I was just gonna call. Drove 2 hours to tell you... don't call me any more. Why? We've been together 2 months? You don't return my calls, never answer. Drives me crazy. I'd rather know you won't call. I like not calling you. It'd be hard not not calling you. What? May seem fucked-up, but... knowing you're waiting for my call... seems comforting. How about not calling another girl? It's you I don't wanna call! It's more fun not calling me than not calling another girl? Wouldn't be the same. Why? It'd feel like cheating. Luc... I know why you can't connect with audiences. Your problem... is you treat your audience like your girlfriends. When people don't feel the love, they turn off. Then why don't you turn off? Great show last night. Oh, watch out... when you say... "curvy" - "curvy banana"? It's confusing. Say "curving" instead. "Curvy" is too English. "Curving" is more French. Say "currrrvings." Roll your Rs. "Currrrving banana," not "curvy." We don't get it. Roll those Rs. "Currrrving banana." See the response to my new bit about skiing? It'll work. It's great, 'cause... when Gad Elmaleh did it, 10 years ago, it was hilarious. It's great -you give it your own... tacky spin. My treat. My pleasure. Why would you? Spontaneous act of friendship. I called your humor tacky! So? Life's a gift -why be touchy? Violent act against compulsive kindness. Kind of guy who... pays the tab after being insulted. The harsher, the funnier. You're right. That'd make a great bit. See? You have it! You caught that. That's your gift. Mocking me? My wife always says. It's who I am. My wife always says you cannot not like me. That's why I hate you. Pick you up in 2 days? Bastard! I'll kill you! Left you 8 messages today! I'm your sister! How dare you?! Stop! Have a nice vacation. What's forbidden? Things? What things? Can't bring anyone home. Don't do anything! Don't leave the house except for work! Clear?! Don't betray my trust. You trust me? Police still refuse to link Remy Lafrance's disappearance with that of several Montrealers in recent years. I feel like the Grim Reaper. You work in palliative care, sweetheart. Don't take it personally. The average stay's 23 days. My patients croak after 11. Yes, but what an 11 days! Ever consider that? I've been blessed 19 years. Dr. Nault wants me to smile more. Wait- he's hitting on you? He's 71. See the effect you have on men? You awaken sleeping libidos. Charm comes out your ears. Best rehab experience by fan. Beautiful place - clean, new. Thank you. Don't mention it. I went deep into my emotions. Real deep. Rather than getting high to avoid bottled-up negative feelings, I willingly delved into my emotions. My childhood... Dad's abuse... Talked a lot about you. How you protected me. Every time... it got to me. But sadness is okay. It's part of me. I love my sadness. It's legitimate. Good night, sad ness. Don't remember much about Dad. How'd he treat me? Abusive even then, huh? Don't spare me. Yes. I knew it. Examples...? He hit me? With What? With...? A saucepan. Saucepan! Small or big? - Big. Enough to get stuck on your head. Went to the ER, but... even with Vaseline... it wouldn't come off. - How old was I? What year? - '89. Before we switched to Teflon. It's coming back to me. You went to school wearing a pot. Handle looked like bangs. - Screwing with me? - Little bit. "40 - Cause for celebration!" You bet. "Loving husband, happy 40th birthday. "Thanks for what you bring to our lives. "I'm not always easy to live with. "As you know, work's been tough. "Add to that my... premenopause... which doesn't bode well. "It's hard to bean "it's not always easy. "Some days, I'd rather stay in bed. "Is it all worthwhile? "Bills, mortgage... "What's the point? "We never go anywhere. "Life's a bottomless... pit. Anyway, happy 40th birthday." Thanks. Worst birthday card ever. Yes, I agree. Sorry! IT'S A HIT! WELCOME TO ANSE-AU-PIC Got tickets for tonight. It'll be fun! We'll cut loose, drink, dance! Coming, right, Roger? Don't cancel again at the last minute. I'm going for sure. Really? Your dad letting you out? That time of the year already? After-party at your place? No one's ever been. Must be clean. Lay off. What'd he ever do to you? Wasn't spiteful. Look... breathe, Roger. Loosen up. Don't encourage him. Once he starts... he'll give us a table dance. We'll see his little pecker. He... s-s-should talk. Should talk... him. That hurts! A real comedian! Don't say that, Manon. Your pessimism's talking. This way. Easy on the bacon. At that price... Enough. Hi. We're seeing your show tonight. Lucky you. Not a fan of stand-up, but I'll make an exception. Why not sit with the other comic? What comic? Roger, you bought tickets for nothing. Got him for free! He's painfully shy. C'mon! Look which end he comes out. That's Roger Gendron. Want an autograph? That's okay. Roger's funny, too. Just doesn't know it. Sorry. Got a live one here. I just hit the jackpot. ML.. Fry Cook, you single? Back row didn't hear. Single? Yes... I... I'm not... married. Not married. Big surprise! Your name, Roger? Well, Roger. His name's Roger! He knows. You're his caseworker? Can't let these beasts roam free. It's dangerous! Sorry, but you'll be... the butt of Marco's jokes all night. It'll be torture, but it always makes 'em laugh. Marco! Come. I'll stoop to your level. Dear discriminating audience... we'll conduct an experiment. Let's play. Whack-A-Mole with Roger Gendron. To piss off Marco, let's mock Roger till it's not funny any more. Bachelorhood is like clothes: It's not supposed to last 20 years. Even 1:30 minutes of speed-dating is too long for you. "My name's Roger. I make fries." Whoops, 1:28 minutes to kill. Roger, I don't know you, but losing your virginity... must've cost you a fortune. When's the last time you called a girl without MasterCard knowing? You have such an ass face, we can't tell if you're coming or going. Your penis-- Your penis is like the Loch Ness Monster: No one's ever seen it, but the thought of it terrifies women. Roger Gendron!!! I'll wake you up? Luc! Wake up! What is this? Help!! What's going on? What're you doing? This about yesterday? Was all in fun. We do it all the time. Don't take it personally. Are you... taking it personally? I-I'm so very sorry. We're civilized. Let's talk. I have kids. - Want money...? - Ask anything! This... is a ball-cutter. Who's laughing now? Sorry. My turn to have fun. A body part for every lame joke... at my expense. Damn, you're bleeding already. Nervous reaction. Squids spew ink, I get nosebleeds. Must be something we can do? We'll hold a press conference. And m-m-make... a public apology. It was wrong. We'll never do it again. We'll do farm work, milk stuff... animals. I'm mechanically inclined. How old's your roof? We'll sweep the driveway, mow the lawn. We'll be your slaves, shovel this winter. Organize your Tupperware. Make you a funny voicemail message. I do voices. Bake you pecan pies. - Open a joint bank account. - Massage your toes! - Roll your pennies. - Massage your scalp! Need socks? Got a deal on white socks. For you... we'll produce... Pimp my... Barn. Rent porn for you. Got it! We'll do a huge show: A Tribute to Roger! Invite all your friends... Forget the tribute. - Bad idea. We'll hassle your coworkers. Hate that smart-ass mop jockey! He mocked you speechless. I've got it! We'll give you pointers. Comebacks for putdowns. You ridiculed me most! Exactly. We're experts, so... Right! We'll teach you to be funny. Someone's mocking you, you respond with zingers - everyone's in stitches. Greatest feeling... in the world. You become funny, you'll be... the star of Anse-au-Pic. A star? A superstar. In Anse-au-Pic. Sorry. Go ahead. So... can we start the comedy lessons? Now? Buying time? Right? Think your families are looking for you and the cops will show up? You're not the first cocky Montrealers to buy it here. Cocky Montrealers? Montrealers... Think the rest of Quebec is hick central! You'll need... pen and papen. By the way, I'm from the 'burbs. Nothing like Montreal. It's ugly. Live there... for my kids... So... Carl. Yeah... smart-ass mop jockey at the Beluga. Lise's and Real's son. Local hockey hero. Almost made the NHL training camp. I despise him. So get him good. We're warming up. Even one good one... isn't bad. Here we go. Free association. Jokes'll come to me... Once I get rolling... You were named Carl 'cause... any longer you couldn't spell it. Your grades were like your hockey shorts. They both stank! Wanna get paid to be on the ice... drive a Zamboni. Good one. Only mark Carl made on hockey was in his underwear. Y'know... skid marks. See him hitting on a girl, say: "No NHL players here tonight, huh?" Only cup he earned is a "cupple" smacks. Not bad. Went from ice jock to mop jockey. Only mark he made on hockey was in his underwear. Y'know? Got the CV of a 14-year-old, except a 14-year-old can still dream. On the menu, you're jealous of the fish & chips - at least that gets picked! That's mean. Good one, fish & chips. I liked the skid-marks joke. I can fine-tune it-- That's good, Luc. You'll laugh. Only psychology will save us. Saw a TV show on serial killers. They dehumanize their victims. Gotta make Roger see us as human. Call him "Roger" as often as possible. Wanted to call him "sweetie." Seriously. Roger must become attached to us. I'll talk about my kids, Manon. You, your sister. Your hardships. That'll move him. Your sister called me. Asking about you. We chatted... Told me your dad was hard on you. Smacking you around... Humiliations... The bra in the schoolyard... She and I clicked. She'd click with a tomato plant. Very thoughtful... Roger: Luc and I appreciate... Really... Thanks, Roger: Brown station-Wag on. No car here... The maid found his room empty-- On the menu, you're jealous of the fish & chips... On the menu... 2 lobster clubs, 1 shrimp poutine. Only the best for people on welfare. Be rig ht with you, lovebirds. With crayons for your girlfriend, old perv! Chantal, come back anytime, huh? You're family. She had laser hair removal. Where? In Roberval City. On the menu... You're good. Good with a butter knife. Trying to lighten the mood. Lay off my mood. Got these at a restaurant. Idiots were giving 'em away. Cheapskate. So what's your tattoo? No idea. Why's that? Kind of fuzzy... Guess it's for the best. Check out the hunk. Best scorer that year. What's wrong, Roger? Are you hot? Works too hard for an old man. On the menu you're jealous of the fish & chips that gets picked. Stop! Made a fool of myself!! Made a fool of myself. Works too hard for an old man. On the menu you're jealous of the fish & chips that gets picked. Hand me your... recorder. Works too hard for an old man. On the menu, you're jealous of the fish & chips... at least that gets picked! Y'know? You just waited too long. Want a good comeback... to Carl's joke... Roger; Let people laugh. When the laughter's at... 33% power... nail him. 33%? Or 36, 38, nun? Anyway, way to go, Roger: For your first try, that was... really... My son and daughter.. Couldn't have done better Luc? Yes, Marco. Your son, Arthur: - Arthur. - And your daughter.. - Chloe. - Chloe... couldn't have done better. - Your sister, too. Julie. She, too, would be very proud. Right, Luc? - Rig ht as usual, Marco. - Thanks, Luc. - You're welcome, Marco. You okay, Roger? Allergic to hay, or going crazy? Julie? I'm glad you called. House in the 'burbs, loving couple, kids... Happy families get to me. Sadness is okay. It's part of me. I love my sadness. It's legitimate. Just got out of rehab. Went deep into my emotions. Really deep. You on meds? Want some? I'm good. Suggestion: Self-deprecating jokes. Laughing at your own flaws. Fat people make fat jokes. Short people, short jokes. You could make jokes... No, you don't need to go there. Not there. I like that - self... self-deprecation. I'm not feeling it. Me neither. I want to be... self-deprecated. Go on, make jokes about me. Hang on. I got nothing. I'm trying. Don't be scared. I can take it. You got something. I won't be insulted. You'll regret it. Let him speak. I'm begging you. Spit it out. You're a frustrated fuckwit, lowlife cat-litter residue. Your dating profile reads: "Best seen from the back." Sex with you is like sticking an arm in a snowblower. You're like an autistic... without the genius part. You're like a cheap sofa: 12 months - no interest. What's with your walk? I have more control over my balls! You exude ineptitude. Even Jesus would say: "There's a limit to loving one another!" So not funny. Not even a giggle. That's good. That's how people see me. They mistake my shyness for stupidity. It'll be funny coming from me. Good salad, Roger. Thanks. Sorry, I know it's rude. It's for Monday's book club. What's it about? A nurse who kills old folks. Better watch out, Roger. Go ahead, laugh. Besides, I'm an embarrassment to frustrated bachelors - I exude ineptitude. Don't say things like that. What didn't help... you didn't indicate it was a joke. Right! I'll say, "Attention! I'm making a joke!" For a joke to work, it needs... a comedic intonation. Every joke has its own music. Right. Music now! A... very precise beat. I'm an embarrassment to frustrated bachelors - I exude ineptitude! Right. I bought my personality at a yard sale. Y'know? Why"- It-it-it's a cue. Just a cue. If you spoke normally: "I bought my personality at a yard sale." it's not funny. 'Course not. Exactly. Not funny. For a gag to be funny, it needs... a comedic intonation. I bought my personality at a yard sale. I bought my personality at a yard sale. I bought my personality at a yard sale! I bought my personality at a yard sale. Got it. It'll work. It'll work. It will... work. Right! Remember our race? Roger's quite an athlete. Had no wet suit, so he wore a sweatshirt. A lovely cotton sweatshirt. Turquoise! Matched His hat! Cotton soaks up water, huh? When he capsized... the river level dropped a foot. Remember? I bought my personality at a yard sale. Roger; please!! Roger; stop! Why don't they laugh when I do your gags? 'Cause... Good question. 'Cause... Who are you? Who are you? We don't know you! We need to know you better to write gags for you. What do you wanna know? Well... You could tell us what prompted... your... passion. When I was small... Montreal tourists laughed at us. At my mother's clothes. It really upset hen. One Sunday afternoon... the snottiest of Montrealers... antique dealers... came to the village... to get an armoire. Loaded it into their trailer. Didn't tie it properly. I was running in the street. Mom ran after me. Stopped right by the trailer. Then... the armoire tipped over... and... Mom... was squashed. It squashed her. My dad never laughed again. Blames me for what happened. Made me pay ever since. So... killing Montrealers... eases the pain. Did I mention I'm from the 'burbs? Going back to your relationship with your dad... it's childhood trauma. Your dad oppressed you, so... when someone attacks you - like Carl - you freeze. Hence your lack of self-confidence. I do lack self-confidence. Sorry, but... you exude a certain confidence. Timid people don't chop up antique dealers. See? You should channel that confidence into your comedy. Channel that into my comedy? Look -imagine Carl's tied up and you can do anything to him. In conclusion, I'd like to say... I've known... Lise and Real for 6 months... and believe in love ever since. Happy 30th anniversary. Your turn. My pay's never been late in 8 years. Thanks, Lise. Thanks, Real. It's real fun working with Lise. Real fun. She should've been a masseuse - she loves talking behind people's backs. Real... never cheated on Lise. Then again... I've seen him fondling the cash register. He's faithful. Together 30 years. He's devoted. Greasy or not... Squeaking when he touches her... I'm talking about the cash register! Not Lise. Nice going, dickhead. - What the hell?! Idiot! - Don't touch me! What were you thinking?! It's going very well. Making progress... Showing... real self-confidence. Only thing missing - not much - should've started with that - to make people laugh... is finding your inner clown. My inner clown, now. All great comics have one. Their comic energy. That's why we love them. We'll find yours and you'll beloved. I'm sick of looking stupid. On the contrary. To find the inner funny Roger... embrace your inner idiot. I'm lost. Don't talk... Sorry. Just move. Move... now? Just move. Little more. That's good. Relax. Stomp your feet. Wiggle those shoulders. Move your arms. Loosen up. Pretend you're a monkey. Come on. You have lice! You're itchy! All over! Now do the bacon. Lie down and sizzle like bacon. That's it. You're on high! Fry, Roger, fry! Good! Keep going! I don't look stupid? It's really you. Again... What're you doing? Frying the other side. He's frying the other side. Enough. Get up. Now leave the barn. Get out! Did I do something wrong? Don't speak! Leave, then come back. Go on. Get out. We're on a roll. Come back. Leave, then come back. Again. Leave. Come back. Are you screwing with me?! That... that's your clown! You've got it! That little voice - that's your clown! Don't lose it. This is my clown? This is my clown? You're funny. Sure? Think you'll make 'em laugh. You're a diamond in the rough. A natural. A great talent. I'm almost jealous. What a suck-up expert! That's good. Suck-up. He's got it. Well done. We didn't really teach him comedy. You've got it or you don't. We allowed him to be himself. Almost touching. Think he'll let us go? Their disappearance is a mystery. Alleged disappearance. - Missed 2 shows and hasn't called. - So? We talk every day. Your brother call every day, too? Never. Your Chinese noodles are excellent. Thanks. A real geisha! Just missing the hair-bun chopsticks! Now, Carl...! I'm disappointed. A geisha! Try harder. You can do better. Look at my face. Could've said: Put it on cigarette packs so people stop smoking. I'm not done. Could've said: I have the sex appeal of a central vacuum cleaner. Look at me. I'm 55 years old. I'm a snack-bar cook. I'm still living with my daddy. Is that a winner? With more personality than me. And it was dead. Roadkill. Flat as a pancake. Real ran it over. Wasn't even driving. You're such a goof. Thank you. He's getting there. You're persistent. Anyway... if we ever get out... I'll only do original material. I'm considering a new character... Think you'll like it. A gay mime. A gay mime? Original, huh? Gay mime. Introducing: "The gay mime"! No sound. Can't speak. Y'know? Stop. A gay mime? One clich? wasn't enough? Now you're piling them on? Great evolution. I don't get it. In my life... I strive to be considerate. I'm respectful. I bring a good energy. Don't know why... but people enjoy laying into me. 'Cause I'm positive, they think a slap in the face won't hurt. Even Roger called me a suck-up. I'm probably the only one who's ever been nice to him in his whole fucking life! But, no, he scorns me. I'm getting a bit fed up. Enough. I pref era happy pain in the ass than a sad one. You've got it! What was that? - Dunno. Get off me! Easy. Hold on. Dammit. Careful. Hang on. You're in a hurry to get home. Got a date? Yeah, 2 waiting at home. One for you, one for me. I'll follow. They're ugly. Wait! You okay? M 3,2,1... What...? I don't like this. I'm funny. Seems you don't wanna celebrate. So... adios, little duckies. Wait. Something terrible's happened. I feel these things. I feel it, too. Listen, little ladies... I'll be honest. If we launched an investigation every time 2 little comics took off... Put that way... Hold on. First, they're not "2 little comics," but great artists devoting their lives to giving people joy - not tickets. Second, I won't put up with your contempt! I'm having a burnout! Don't have the energy for this shit! Clear?! People fighting for dignity gets to me. Just got out of rehab. Really delved into my emotions. He won't let us drown like rats! He's giving us a bath. It's a spa. Later: cooking classes, pony rides. Don't talk to me like that! How, then? I'm not your doormat! How about- Your gay mime's gonna bitch-slap me? Say what?! Still need your help, Luc. Only special ones move to the house, Luc. Take it as a compliment. Follow the chain. Bed's small. Want Marco in the cellar? Is it comfy? It's a cellar. Is there a bed? Could put in a mattress. He's not an animal. Your call. Kinda gotten used to him. Don't let him take advantage. Ignore me, why don't you?! We're talking. Look at yourselves! The village idiot and misunderstood genius! Tweedledum and Van Gogh!!! In cahoots! Relax. Fuck you! Both of you! Wipe each other's asses! Don't gimme that look! I don't give a shit! Don't give a shit! Marc: o's finding his clown. Yeah? Well, fuck my clown! Fuck his clown ass good! Again! There. Y'know, Luc... Stephanie... Women intimidate me. It's like... I don't know how to handle them. Try not carving 'em up, moron! Say I wanna seduce Stephanie. What do I do? How do you connect with women? Well... it's easy- Be honest, sexy boy! Tell him your love life sucks! Say it! That true? Your love life's... Know what? That's a relief. It'll be easier to work together if we're alike with the ladies. Let's not generalize. Okay... now you'll write jokes about this. The Age of Death watch your mouth. It deals with loneliness in the big city. I wrote an essay on it. If you like-- - Excuse me. Not sure there's a subtext. To me... it's just a good gory book. Loved it. Excuse me... I'm in the mood for murder. Feel good being a serial killer's pet? For once, you're connecting with someone. Quite someone, huh? That's your target audience? Chainsaw-wielding maniac?! Physical violence -just like Roger! You really surprised me. Just commented on the book. They loved you. This is me. You're sweating. It is so humid. I feel all sticky, too. I feel like showering, air-drying naked on my bed. Wanna go for coffee? I've got a date. Not with Carl, I hope. I know, he's too young. Not too smart or cultivated. Yet... he's something, huh? He's something all right. Excuse us, sir. Sorry to bother you. Have you seen these men? $1,000 REWARD. You okay? Wish I could help more - but you won't leave hungry. Great sandwiches, Mr Gendron. Oh, yes! I rarely eat the crust. I do. If you touch my sister- I'll kill you! Listen... Luc's number: 514-555-3543. That's funny. They're giving personal info, not knowing you're my captives. What d'you call that in comedy? "Rip your head off!" Where are they? Motel. Tomorrow I'll help them not find you. Thanks for your help, Mr. Gendron. Call me Roger. You okay? Why? What is it? Dunno. I sense lots of pent-up sadness. Here she goes again. I feel these things. I, too, have pent-up sadness. But I love it. It's part of me. It's legitimate. Like joy. When your sadness erupts, it'll be beautiful. I'd love to be there. Don't know about that. See lots of anger, too. Lots. Am I wrong? Could be. Internalizing it is so unhealthy. That anger's burning hot! Find a way to release that wonderful hostility. Like ripping your head off? Kidding. Good one. Just joking. She's just out of rehab - really delved into her emotions. My sister doesn't need a psycho fucking her up more. She's getting better. Really in touch with her feelings. Too much. Goddamn tours. If I was around more... I'm the pillar of the family. Imagine. Wait. 1, 2... He'll put locks on the napkins. "The poutine - more sauce, less cheese!" Lise is always nice to people. "Looking good, Johanne! Stoned on antidepressants. I'll drop by your place. The place stinks!" Carl's my favorite. Look at the champion. His folks spent 20 years in arenas. All they got was hemorrhoids. It's funny 'cause it's true! We've made wittle Carl sad. You enjoy a good laugh, huh? Especially at others' expense. You - you'll never mock me again. Clear? Anyone else wanna mock me? What'd you do to Julie? Julie and Manon are great. By the way, they say hi. Stephanie accepted my dinner invitation. Hi, Dad. 'Course not. Why d'you-- I... I did-- But, Dad-- What'd he say? What's your dad think of your homicidal hobby? My dad... forbids me to kidnap and kill people. He's fucked up, your dad. Should be making him laugh. Y'know, Luc... I'll use my own material. Really? I'll tell the truth with a comedic intonation. 'Course, I won't say people died here. Need a damn funny intonation to make that fly. Not a peep, okay? Otherwise... Delicious. Worked hard on this dinner. Hope you like it. Know those 2 missing comics? I kidnapped them. They're teaching me the art of comedy. Good id ea. They're upstairs, listening in. Great job, guys! Not a peep, or your families are history! Can't get over it. How you're so much... funnier? More than that. What surprises me most isn't your sense of humor... Know when you toasted Lise and Real? And when you grabbed Carl? It was so unexpected. You surprised me... terribly. Always liked intense guys. But it ruined my love life. 'Cause of my fucked-up relationships, I left Montreal. Thought you were from Rimouski. Spent a year there, but 20 years in Montreal. Y'know, Montreal's... a great city. All sorts of people, artists... Very open-minded... Dunno. It was too open. See? That's it. That look... it's like raw power. Like you're invincible. Right now.. I want to kiss you. I have a confession. What? If he says he kills people in her area code... I'm a virgin. Should've gone with the area code. Can't remember the last time someone held me. Got an embarrassing confession, too. I'm not proud of it. Been single 20 years, working in bars... Y'know, tourists... I've slept with over 1,000 men. I've slept with over 1,000 men. Th-thousand? Thousand! Thousand? Thousand. Thousand like... Thousand and One Nights? Thousand Islands? Thousand Island dressing? No wonder the French find us friendly. They were strangers. I'd never see them again. You're the... first one I could really fall for. Right now, I'm scared to death. It'll be like my first time, too. We're fucked-up, huh? - He'll kill her. - Maybe not. - Have to warn her! - Stay out of it! Think of Manon and Julie. That's it. Scared? Yes! Jeez. 4th or 5th time? Stopped counting at 3. Got a confession. What? I've done things... that... I'm not very proud of. Bad things. Think... you'll do bad things to me? Never I want you, warts and all. Including all your bad deeds. Don't know why I'm crying. What's wrong? Why the long face? Shut up. Why are you mad? Went so well. She adores you. We did it. I still have to kill you. If I let you go, you'll go to the cops! - 'Course not. - No way. Won't say a word. Thanks for coming. That's a high-quality sadness. I'm happy for you. Oh, shut up!! I keep imagining the worst. My Marco at the bottom of a lake, bloated like a microwaved hot dog, eaten by fish! Don't panic. We'll find them. No kidneys, heart, lungs; Pancreas in the ashtray. They stumbled into a pot field and bikers killed them. Or flipped over in a ditch, on fire, Marco burning, screaming: "Manon! Jesus Murphy. I wanna say something. These may be our final moments. I wouldn't share them with anyone but you. Your integrity... your determination... your courage... transformed me. I've really appreciated your company. Really. - Me, too. - Really? What'd you appreciate about me? You're very... human. Coming from you... What do you mean by "human," exactly? Your generosity. Great com passion. Manon. Positive outlook on life. Candor. Your infectious laughter. Lovely softness. Not just skin-wise. Generally. Marco, you... Thanks. You're... Sorry, but... you really suck at this. Fake, fake. So very fake... But I do appreciate it. Really. We've still got- Sorry. Don't apologize. "I love your sadness. It's beautiful. I, too, have lots of sadness. Gets to me every time. I accept my mental illness." Feels good. She is annoying, but I don't hold it against hen. She's had it rough. Mom died, she was 4. Abusive father. Abusive father? If we don't find her brother, she'll lose it. She only overcame her father's madness because Luc made her laugh. To get to the Gendrons', turn left on Route 13. Go up the road... Guys, you kept your promise... So I'll do this real quick. But... before... I wanted to say... Luc... you and I connected and... I realized why. You connected. We... we connected. You connected. You did. You wanna talk, I can go. We connected... over my dad and... your dad. And... suffering. Crap. Don't know what's wrong with me. Ever since I became funny... I can't stop crying. A toast... to the noblest and most underrated means of alleviating suffering: Humor. Morphine, too. Where's your clown now, huh?! Little clown turning blue?! Lil' bad clown's turning blue! Mr. Gendron! Got good news and bad news. Bad news is... your son's a serial killer. Good news, the series ends here. May come as a shock-- Drop the gun. Junior! Junior goddammit! Told you not to bring anyone home! Junior? You're Roger...? That means you, Roger... YOU never... I never killed anyone. Him? Doesn't have what it takes. Too weak. Only good for cleaning up after me. Doesn't have it here! Just pretended, guys. Sorry. He's sorry! We're gonna have fun. I smell Montrealers. Watch how we have fun in the boonies. You... Prepare my outdoor kit. I'll be back. I'm from the 'burbs. Must think I'm a loser... You were raised by a psycho. Dad's not a psycho. His dad was, though. Him... Stop. Roger, please. Do something! Roger found them! What's he holding? What lovely company. What's going on?! Wrong place, wrong time. You've no reason to fear your dad. He's 80! - Outta my way! - Defend yourself! - Fight back! Look at me. You're not the same guy any more. There's a woman in your life. Think he'll leave Steph alone? Luc's right. Think of Stephanie. You made love 5 times in a row 5 times? Can't believe it. Must accept my imminent death. Thanks, everyone. Spent an extraordinary week with a great-hearted woman. Your listening qualities amaze me. Thanks for everything. Marco, we've only spoken on the phone. You have a well-decorated home. Lovely color scheme, tasteful. Got to me. Your wife loves you so much, it's nuts! Roger, I'm very disappointed in you. Trusted you. We shouldn't have bought you a gift! Smaller basket, anyway! Always knew it would end this way. Don't say that, Manon. It can't be. You thought me a pessimist... Stop. We had some good times. Think of our wedding. Even then... Walking down the aisle, seeing you at the altar, I said to myself: This will end in a bloodbath. I'd give anything to hold you. Got snot on your shirt. Old fart! Old wreck, I'm talking to you! Senile old goat! Should be a spoon of Jell-O! Like killing simple people? You're the fucking simpleton! Your son's 10 times smarter! Got more smarts in his little toe than in your fat head! Pus-filled old skin bag! You're a walking Ziploc filled with crap! Putrefied! Tell him to shut up! Shut up. Lucky your wife got squashed. Spared her a life of misery with an inbred cracker in his backwoods shit-hole! - Motherfucker! - Dad! No swearing in front of guests. Get the camera, jackass! Capture the moment. Get their faces. I wanna see everything. I love you so much. Told you we'd make it. Told you it'd end in a bloodbath. My beloved brother, got something important to tell you: This ordeal made me a better person. Fuck! Finally! What's going on? Who are ya bunch of psychos? Maniacs! Was strolling on Rachel St., some psycho jumped me! Need pepper spray in Montreal?! I'm hot! Thirsty! Hypoglycemic! Need an apple! Damn. There a phone here? No signal here, huh? Where's the old bastard? He jumped me! Where is he?! Won't go down like this! I'm connected! If you don't kill him, I will. We're fucked-up, huh? Little bit. Subtitling produced with the participation of Telefilm Canada. Translation and Subtitling: Sybe
