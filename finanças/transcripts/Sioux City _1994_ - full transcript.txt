You're welcome. Oh, um... Reichert wants you to see himin his office. Now. >> What could you have Been thinking? Well, sir, I feltthat Mr. Hartman's symptoms were caused for the most partby the medications we were administering. So you took himoff everything. Yes, sir, and he stabilizedwithin two hours. That's not the point. You did it without the knowledgeor consent of his doctor. I-I tried to get aholdof Dr. Summers, sir, and I couldn't. This isn't the first timeyou've played renegade on me, Goldman. I don't know what you'retrying to prove, but don't try it hereand don't let this happen again. You ask before you act. Is that clear? Yes, sir. You haven't taken any timeoff in more than 18 months. Actually, that would be19 months, sir. Indeed. When your shiftis over, you're on vacation. Two weeks. Be glad it's not a suspension. Yes, sir. What did reichert want? Don't start with me. I get cranky after 37 hours... I'm just asking. I got read out again. Again? Again. What for? Hartman. See, now, I told you. Should've waited. Should've checkedwith Dr. Summers on that. You know as well as I dothe patient was going critical. I'm not sayingthat you weren't right. I'm saying that youshould've waited. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe you need to getsome sleep, huh? >> Jesse, E.R. Stat, come on. Come on! >> It's open, mom. You're not dressed yet. Not to mention not showered yet. Well, it's goodto see you, too. Hi. Oh... poor baby. Mom, if I told you I just gotoff a 44-hour shift, would you let me skipthis one, please? Your own birthday party! No, I won't, not on your life. Don't go back to sleep. The presentationis everything, I think. Yeah. Wow. I feel so guilty. Look at him. He's exhausted. But Darryl has him workingtriple shifts. He's not eating or sleeping. Leah, not tonight. It's our son's birthday. Sorry. Indian, native American, whatever's politically correct for the week, I don't thinkjesse cares one way or the other. You know, it's funny... Four years of med school, two years of internship, I never knew this wasyour birthday. Well, it might not be. Excuse me? I said that it might not be. My parents just picked this dateknowing I was born sometime this month. Must be a bitchgetting your chart read. I think it's timeyou opened some presents. >> Okay. What's next? >> Ahem. What is it? Okay, who gave me the rock? Is there a card inside? Oh, no, I'm sure there isn't. I think this is just a jokefrom a friend. I think this is just a jokefrom a friend. It's, uh... uh, from... Dawn rainfeather. She's the woman who used to be my mother. Oh... >> I just, uh, came in To get a drink. There's plentyat the bar, honey. I know. Do you remember that first daythat we brought him home? He was so smallfor a four-year-old. He just stood in frontof the house, his eyes... Wide. He was so lost. So sad. Every time the phone rang, I thought it was his mother calling to say she'dchanged her mind about the adoption, that she wanted him back. And then weeks went by. Months. Years. If I... Lose him now, I'll die. Work hard, play hard. And his glass is empty. No. Thanks. Had enough, really. It's, um... It's... it's beautiful. Yeah, it is. Strange, though. What? The amulet? No. No, the idea of hersending it to me at all. She wants to meet me, talk to me. She says she has somethingimportant to tell me. Well... Is she coming here? No. No, she wants meto go there to, uh, the brown rocks reservationjust outside south sioux city, Nebraska. Reichert did forcetwo weeks' vacation on you, and it's long overdue, if you ask me. Not you too. Me too. Your mother, dawn rainfeather. What's wrong? Uh, nothing. I'm just a little, um... Jesse, you okay? Yeah, I just, uh... Uh, a little... little dizzy. A little dizzy, that's all. You okay? I'll be fine. Jesse, wait. No, it's... >> you all right? Breathe. Just breathe. Breathe. You okay? Har-hard time bre-breathing. Just breathe. Just breathe. Just relax, man. Just breathe. I'll be fine. Jesse, breathe. No, look at me. Look at me. Jess, come on. Talk to me. Hurry up, Douglas! Breathe. >> Jesse. Shh, Jess. Jess. Dawn: Get away from him! Aah! Jess? Look at me. Look at me! Jesse? Jesse? I'm okay, really. I'm... okay... No, hey! Jess? Okay, all right. You're okay. There is absolutelyno medical evidence that this will help. Humor me. Is everyone gone? Guess a nondrinker like meshould've passed on the champagne, huh? I want you to see a doctor. I am a doctor. You know what I mean. Do you want to tell mewhat really happened? I'm okay. Jesse, honey, if anythingis the matter... You'll try to make it better. Yeah! Just like you always have. I think you shouldprobably read this. Tsk. I don't remember her at all. I don't think I wanted to, but for the last couple of days whenever I've managed to close my eyes, I-I have been having these... Dreams, and... And tonight something happened. I don't know what... Jess. You're exhausted. You have been undertremendous stress for months. Well, reichert's forcing meto take a two-week vacation. I screwed up. Well, I didn't reallyscrew up, but... What are you gonna do? Don't take thisthe wrong way. Okay? Please, don't readanything into this that isn't there. I need to go visitthe reservation where I was born. You caught me. Thought I'd help myselfto some leftover cake. Want some? No. No, thanks. I'm not hungry. Mom told you, huh? Mm-hmm. How is she? Scared. I'm coming back, pop. Well, I hope so. I spoke to Darryl today. He's worried about you. Oh, really? He's gota funny way of showing it. He'd never tell youto your face, Jess, but he respects you, even when you break the rules. Hey, you're a good doctor, a natural. Don't lose sightof that, please. I'm not running awayfrom anything here, dad. And... and you've gotta know that I would never do anything to hurt you and mom. Yeah, I know that. But your mother's fear... Maybe mine... is that you'll be the one to get hurt. Maybe mine... is that you'll be the one to get hurt.

The cop said so. Hi. You live around here? Ma says I can't talk to nobody I don't know. Well, I'm just lookingfor someone who used to live here. Her name is dawn rainfeather. Did you know her? Well, do you know where she is now? The house burned down, and ma said she went to be with her spirit familyin the sky. Thanks. What can I do for you? Can you tell me anythingabout the fire at 412 third street? You got a reasonfor wanting to know about that? Yeah. Yeah, I was hiredby the family of the deceased to check into it, to... It was a gas heaterexplosion, right? Let me check. Follow me. Wait here. Woman: Have you always hadyour sights set on a political career? No, I haven't. I never thought aboutrunning for political office till recently. I've been urged by a lotof our citizens to do that. You got the wrong info, there, bud. Looks like the Indian womanthat lived there passed out, dropped a cigarette. Drunk, near as we can tell. When did this happen? It was, uh, four... Yeah, four days ago. Of course, if you workedfor the family, you'd know all about that, wouldn't ya? >> Dan Larkin, pick up one, please. Just a second. Larkin. Hey, cuz, what's up? Uh-huh. Yeah. We're gonna cook them. Just bring the deerthat I shot, okay? 'Cause yours gotbuckshot in it. >> Yeah, I'll bring the beer. And you have family here? Oh, yes, matter of fact, ihave a daughter about your age, a very pretty young lady, and I met my wife... No, I'm gonna bring the beer. You just tell the kidsto eat before they get there, 'cause they'll eat meout of house and home, all right? See you then. Hey, what are you doing? Look, I know the autopsyreport says that death was caused by smoke inhalation, but there's a gunshot wound... are you some sort of expert? No, I'm not an expert. I'm a doctor. What's your name? Dr. Goldman, and I'm notan expert, but I did a rotation in forensics and I know... >> you don't know what you're talking about. Get the hell out... >> you're not listening to me! As badly burned as this body is, there's a gunshot wound in the sternum area... >> officer Larkin, what's going on? I can handle it. I'd like to reporta possible murder. Give me about five minutes. Well, there wasa puncture wound, but there's a whole bunchof possible explanations... Injury, collapsing debris, stored ammo that might've exploded because of the heat. Look, captain mcdermott, I'm a doctor. I work the E.R. I know what a gunshot woundlooks like. So does officer Larkin. I believe you two met outside. What's he got to do with it? Officer Larkin wasthe first one on the scene. He was put in chargeof the investigation. In fact, it was hethat first brought the alleged gunshot woundto my attention. Even so, there's no conclusiveevidence that it was the cause of death. Yes, sir, but there isno conclusive evidence that it wasn't. Well, he's my best man. If he and the coroner saydeath was by smoke inhalation, I gotta go along with them. Look, son, if you've gotsomething to say, why don't you justcome out and say it? It just seems to me, sir, that your department is more interestedin controlling your stats than getting at the truth here. The coroner has ruledaccidental death. Now, what are you askingme to do? Exhume the body. Conduct another autopsy. That's gonna be difficult. The body was cremated. W-Well, then, conductanother investigation with the informationthat you already have. You're not sayingmy officers didn't do their job, are you? 'Cause if you are, you're way out of line. Look, captain mcdermott, I'm just asking you to reexamine the evidence, take another look at the autopsy report. If you think that thereis any chance... any chance whatsoever that thismight've been murder... All right, son. I think I know how you feel. Maybe there's a wayi can accommodate you. I'm gonna have all the evidence, all the photos, all the files, brought back and put right hereon my desk, and I'm gonna go through every single itemonce again. But if I don't find anything, that's the end of it, all right? That's all I'm asking.

Old filbert opens that doorand he scoops up... >> One hand! Well, I'd betterget going now. Now, what can I do for you? I was wonderingif anyone here knew dawn rainfeather. I-I'd like to knowif something was done with her ashes. >> Jewish ritual? Yeah. I don't know any Indian ones. Well, thanks for bringing me. I never would've found it. Reservation's a big place. Well, this isn'treservation land anymore. Used to be a sacred place, too, till we lost it in some sort of treatyway back when. So, you coming back to the post? Nah, I don't think so. You don't want to meetthe rest of your kin? There's still some rainfeathersleft on the res. What was she like? I didn't really know herthat well; She was from south sioux. But she was niceand pretty. Maybe a little sad. But she knows you've come, and that's good. Yeah. Yeah, I came. A few days too late. Thanks for your help. >> Were you looking for something specific, or is trashing my room some kind of cowboywelcome wagon? Well, I was lookingfor a file that disappeared right after you tooka look at it, a file that hadthis picture in it. You telling methe whole file's missing? That's exactly whatl'm telling you, Dr. Goldman. You got anything to tell me? I-I only tookthe one photograph. You expect meto believe that? I don't give a damnwhat you believe. Dr. Goldman... I'm beginning to suspectthat your imagination's getting away from you. You see, this isn't L.A. We don't have drive-by shootingshere, or triple-digit homicides, crimes maybe you'vegotten used to. What we got hereis a nice, quiet little town, and I'm gonna do everythingin my power to make sure it stays that way. Like looking the other waywhen your office destroys an inconvenient file? You know, at first I thoughtthis was all a simple case of incompetence, but nowit's starting to look an awful lot like a cover-up. Hey! I'm gonna say this just once, so I want you to pay attention. Don't you ever accusemy officers of impropriety. And don't you ever tell mehow to do my job. You let go of me right now. Now, I suggest you takethat big-city attitude of yours, put it in the trunkof that fancy car, and get your ass back to wherever you come from. Otherwise, you'll find yourselfunder arrest for theft of county property. You want to arrest me, you go ahead and do it and see what my big-city lawyersdo to this case and your future political career. You want to tell me something? How come a rich L.A. doctorlike you is interested in some dead Indian? She was my mother. I never go out with him! Hello. Well, he'd be worthdating if he wasn't Indian. Oh, please, Mary, get over that! Ten bucks says andrewon't get him a table. One for dinner, please. Do you have a reservation? Yeah, it's justoutside of town. Beg your pardon? No. No, I don't havea reservation. I'm sorry, sir. We won't have a tableavailable for at least an hour. May I have your name? If you'll give me your name, sir, I'll see what I can do. Goldman. Jesse Goldman. Jesse, where you been? Hi, Andre. Good evening, Alison. You and, uh, Mr. Goldmanare together? Mm-hmm. You're always late. Sorry. I got hung up. Hmm! So, is our table ready? Right this way. Is this all right? It's lovely, thank you. Sit down! I'm not gonna bite you. Thanks. What the hell's he eatingfor so long? Food stinks in there. He may be from L.A., but he's still on injun time. So, now I workin a newspaper morgue. And, yes, before you even ask, sometimes it's boring. I don't know, sometimesit's fun, too. I mean, it's better than workingin a beef processing plant. You know, the one you passedon the way in. Mm. Yeah, it smells awful. You get used to it. Like everything else. So, tell me about yourself. Are you married? Happily married? You fool around? No, does not apply, and yes. But it sort of depends. On what? Here you are, sir. Whenever you're ready. Thanks. This is on me. Don't be silly. I'm the one that picked up you. Yes, you did. But it's still on me. My, my, my. How am I ever gonnarepay your kindness? How am I ever gonnarepay your kindness? >> She turns me down... Looks to me like you're just not her type. Shut up. Uh, make yourself a drink if you want. I'm not reallya bad housekeeper, just don't finish my work, so I bring it home with me. Do house fires alwaysmake the front page? Around here they do. I mean, it's not likea lot goes on, you know? It was on the newsand everything. Did you know the victim? No. But what didn't make itinto the papers was that she was an alcoholicand a prostitute. Old news, anyway. Hmm... What's this? It's a gift from my mother. Hmm! Does that meansomething special? I have no idea. Did I say something wrong? No. Are you straight? Yeah. Hopelessly so. What about a drink? I don't drink. I do. Listen, um, Alison... The woman who diedin that fire, before she gave me up, she was my mother. Sorry. >> Indian going into a bar. Imagine that. Yeah, no kidding. We're gonna bestuck here all night. ♪♪>> What can I get you? Cup of coffee. Some information, please. About what? Dawn rainfeather. This way. I'm trying to find outabout dawn rainfeather. Can you help me out? Dawn left US to livein the white world a long time ago. So you knew her? I-I've heard some stories. The dead can't defendthemselves from lies. All right, then, what's the truth? You got reason to know? He has reason, red bull. This is dawn's son. Don't get carried away. It's supposed to looklike an accident. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. So, you believeshe was murdered. But you haven't goneto her family with your beliefs. Well, what can they do? Jolene Buckley overat trading post says all I've got's a coupleof distant cousins and a grandfather who thinkshe's some sort of medicine man. So, you don't believethere are men who are gifted with this power? Well, let's just say that if he was, he would've kept his daughterfrom being murdered. Not if it was meant to be. Not if her death was to servea greater purpose. I'm sorry, I just don't buy that. Her death brought you back to your own people, didn't it? Her death brought you back to your own people, didn't it? Her death brought you back to your own people, didn't it? Her death brought you back to your own people, didn't it? Whoo-hoo! Got him. Come on! Larkin, stop! What the hell are you doing? Playing chicken! There he is! Get him! Get him! Yee-hoo-hoo! Run, injun boy! Ooh! That enough for ya? Ooh! You got him. You got him. All right, get your buttoutta the way! All right, get your buttoutta the way! Thought you could get awayfrom me, boy, huh? Huh? Uhh! Ohh! That's for poking your nosewhere it don't belong. That's for messingwith a white woman. Ow! Thirsty, doc? Huh? Come here. Come here! Come on, that's good, boy. Driving under the influenceof alcohol? Doctor ought to know better than that, huh? That's it, boy. Uhh! >> Shh, baby. Mother. Please help me. Shh. Shh. Mother. Mother. I... I need a doctor. The white men who did thisto you still search for you. You would not be safein their hospital. He'll sleep for the day. Look, I'm telling you, the way I figure it, he got up, walked a ways, and died some place else. That's why he wasn't therewhen we went back. Just our luck if he wanderedonto reservation land. Okay, either way, it's gonna look like he got liquored up, cracked up, and died some place else. If he is dead. I knew we should've made surebefore we dumped him. Well, hell, he's justgotta be dead. He don't gotta be nothing, and if he's alive he's gonna be able to I.D. US both. And if that happens, I'm telling you right now, I'm not going down alone. You understand me, dawes? Well, you had a fever, but it's going down. You thirsty? I thought I dreamt all this. Sometimes dreamsand reality are one. I must look like shit. You'll heal. In time. Here. Well, let's have a look here. He's worried abouthis pretty face. >> Let me give you a hand. >> Ah, you look much better Today, my son. Today. How long have I been out? Time has no meaningin the healing process. Thank you, grandfather. This is homewhere your grandmother and I raised your mother. Eh, we'll get you set up here. I'd almost forgottenwhat she looked like. And now? It's startingto come back to me. I don't think that I wantedto remember her... The way she gave me away. I remember that she was crying. For your mother, the tears that began that day flowed until the day she died. Then why did she do it? Only she can tell you why. And she's dead. Oh, but her spirit lives. Well, grandfather, I havenever had a conversation with a spirit. And you don't thinkthat's possible? No, I'm afraid I don't. Oh, but you are wrong, son. This is a chanupa wakan, sacred pipe. We believe buffalo calf womangive this pipe to the early lakota. It is used before oneundertakes to seek the truth. Well, how do yougo about that? We call it standing out, a rite of passage, a way to seek visions. I don't think I believein visions. I think you do. >> Oh. Sorry. I thought you'd still be asleep. I didn't knock. You know I hurttoo much to sleep. I bet. I know your grandfather'smedicine is powerful, but Russell thought you mightlike some aspirin. Aspirin? You didn't haveanything stronger? Here, let me help you with this. Thanks. You hungry? Starving. This reminds meof Mexican food a little. Frybread does, anyway. All ethnic culturesseem to borrow from each other when they meet. Oh, really? I wonderwhere latkas come from, then? Latvias? Latkes! Latkes, you know, potato pancakes, usually servedwith a little applesauce and sour cream. It's real old-countryjewish food. I keep forgettingthat your parents are Jewish. Yeah, well, they're morecultural Jews than religious. You miss them, don't you? They're the only familyl've ever known. They gave me a home, a life, a lot of love, in spite of the fact that, um, I wasn't such a great kid. As a matter of fact, I was a pretty rotten kid. I was, uh, you know, bitter, angry, didn't feel like I fit in or belonged. So I rebelled, and they never gave up on me. You have to understandsomething, Jo. My mother chose to give me up. You don't know that. Why? You knowsomething I don't know? No. Hey, look, don't judge her. You have no idea what it's liketo be an Indian women, then or now, and you never will. Excuse me. >> I'm sorry. You know, cousin, there's something I don't understand... why the family had my mother's body cremated. We didn't order that. Just happened. I'm never gonna find outwhat I need to know. Um... there's lots of waysto find answers. We talking about ritualsand ceremonies again? Don't dismiss it too lightly. I did for years. I'm a modern Indian... Who found some... Charismatic church thing, but that didn't work for me. I floundered around for years, did a lot of drugs. Got in a lot of trouble. Then your grandfather, he... Showed me some of the... Old ways. Jesse, haven't you ever beenin a situation, maybe as a doctor, where you just had to go with your heartinstead of your head? Yeah. Yeah, not too long ago, as a matter of fact? Were you right? Yes, I was right. Wasn't that enough? Grandfather: This ismy favorite time of day, as I watch for the daybreak star. You know, it's as if each dawn, the world has another chance for a new beginning. Jesse: There's something I've been meaning to ask you, grandfather. I look aroundand all I see is poverty. The schools are ill-equipped. Clinics can't handlethe number of patients who come in. There's practically no jobsand no future for the children. You think we shouldleave the reservation and live like the wasichu? Well, there's a better worldout there for you. You could be part of it. If we leave, if we give up this land, then we cease to exist. You know that my parents are Jewish, and being jewishis not just a religious preference. It's a whole culturaland historical heritage. I mean, yes, the jewslive among the dominant culture. They do so throughout the world, but they have never lost their sense of identity. And they have never struggledto regain their homeland, never fought to returnto their own holy land? The establishmentof the state of Israel is something altogetherdifferent. Is it? I feel your passion, Jesse. This land is our soul. It is our mother. It is the home of wakan tankaand the spirits of our ancestors. It is only here that wecan truly be who we are. Forgive me, grandfather, but it's that kind of belief that causes your childrento grow up with poor education, poor healthcare, and no hope. Do we suffer for our beliefs? Yes, I think we do, just as the goldmans and their parents before themsuffered for theirs. But what is a man who hasall the things this life can offer, but for it has given up his immortal soul? You think that'swhat I've done? Well, you deny your heritage. I don't know my heritage. Then I think it's timeyou learned. >> Look, he said he would call Me, and he didn't. Maybe he didn't want to speak to you. No, he hasn't beento his hotel in days. He hasn't picked uphis messages! Will you listen to me? Look, look...! These are from his parents. They are worried too. He's fine, okay? I want to see him. No. Look, tell him I'm here. Oh, god, Jesse. You did what? Well, I wanted to seeif Jesse Goldman was okay. He's a doctor that I metat the final edition. I know who he is. Well, he didn't report this, but he was beaten and left for dead. He says that Dan Larkin did it. Ah! He told you that, did he? Jesse said it's because he'sbeen asking about his mother. He believes thatshe was murdered. Well, he's crazy. Daddy, he thinksthat you're responsible. That proves he's crazy. I didn't even know his mother. No, I mean about the beating. I told him... That he was wrong, that you would never do anything like that. So, was I wrong? No. Of course youweren't wrong, baby. Look, I don't think you should see him again. He's courting nothingbut trouble. I don't want you caughtin the middle. >> Look, baby, listen to me. Sweetheart, you've gotno idea how much I love you and your mother, how hard I've worked to protect you from thingsyou don't understand, from people who woulddo you harm. Look at me. Come on, now. I want you to promise meyou won't see him again. I can't promise you that. I told you to stay awayfrom him. Have you gone to bed with you? Oh... Answer me! Answer me! No, I am not gonnaanswer you. You have no rightto ask me that! None. Alison. You're kidding me, right? Don't tell meyou don't know how to ride, fancy rich boy like you. Uhh! Of coursei know how to ride. What, sidesaddle? Where are we going? We're here. Here, I brought youthis jacket. It's gonna get cold real soon. Something, isn't it? It sure ain't Griffith park. What's that? It's this park. It's in the center of... Never mind. It's not important. How'd you find this place? Well, it sort of found me. I come up herewhenever I start to forget what's really important in life. But usually alone? Yeah. But not this time. Getting cold. Yeah, it is. I'd make US a fire, but I must've skipped that part in boy scouts. Think I have a better idea. Mm. Jolene... Shh. No words. No promises. Just hold me. You've decided to trystanding out? Yes. Grandfather: From this momentuntil the end of your quest, no food or waterwill pass your lips. No sleep will close your eyes. You will touch no woman, and keep close to only your wotai, your personal charm. I ask wakan tanka, the great spirit, to be with you, for now it begins. >> The spirit comes to US... To the north, buffalo people... Our strength, our endurance, and our truth comes to US. What is pure... Courage and blessings... We ask... For our brother and son. To the east, what sun rises, giving US another sacred day. To the south, the spirits and the spotted eaglegive US peace. We offer this sacred tobaccoto begin... Our inipi ceremony. May all our relatives live. As you enter the wombof mother earth, may this sweat lodge ceremonywith its life-blood of water cleanse and prepare your bodyand your spirit as you stand aloneand await for three days and nightsand as you seek the truth through sacred visions. The kid's doingthe vision thing, so figure we waittill he goes off alone, we trail him. And then once he's offreservation land... you do nothing. You fucked up once, Dan. This time just let me know where he goes. We'll handle it together. Oh! These belong to your mother. She speaks to youthrough these things. I don't understand. These things tellthe story of her life, and of yours. Know them... And you will know the truth. You know where you're going? Yeah, thanks. Yeah.
