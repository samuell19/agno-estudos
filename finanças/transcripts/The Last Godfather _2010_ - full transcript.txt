IF YOU THINK THAT THIS IS THE TIME TO STEP DOWN, DON CARINI, THEN WHO ARE ANY OF US TO QUESTION YOUR WISDOM? ANTHONY, EVER SINCE I TOOK YOU IN AS A SMALL BOY, YOU HAVE BEEN LIKE A SON TO ME. I AM HUMBLED BY YOUR KIND WORDS. I COULD ALWAYS COUNT ON YOU TO THINK OF THE FAMILY FIRST. - UNTIL MY DYING BREATH. - YOU ARE LOYAL AND RESPECTFUL. YOU KNOW I CARE ABOUT THE FAMILY MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS WORLD. AND THAT IS WHY I WANT YOU TO HELP TRAIN MY SUCCESSOR. WHAT? ANTHONY, YOU ARE LIKE A SON TO ME, BUT YOU ARE NOT MY SON. ALL DUE RESPECT, DON CARINI, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A SON. - I DO HAVE A SON. - WHAT? HE IS THE ONE I WANT TO TAKE OVER THE HEAD OF THIS FAMILY. - ( gulls cawing ) - ( ship's horn blowing ) REMEMBER WHEN I HAD TO TAKE A POWDER DURING THE LAST WAR WITH THE BONFANTES? I JUMPED ON A SHIP HEADED FOR ASIA. AND THERE, IN ALL PLACES KOREA, I MET THE WOMAN WHO CAPTURED MY HEART-- SOO MI PARK. SKIN LIKE BUTTER. HAIR AS SOFT AS SILK. WE HAD A SON TOGETHER. SHE NAMED HIM... - YOUNGGU. - YOUNGGU? THE BONFANTES FOUND OUT WHERE I WAS HIDING AND THEY SENT ONE OF THEIR ZIPS. AND SOO MI, MY SOULMATE, TOOK THE BULLET THAT WAS INTENDED FOR ME. I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO BRING MY YOUNG SON, YOUNGGU, TO AN ORPHANAGE, AND RETURN TO AMERICA ALONE TO SETTLE BUSINESS. BUT I NEVER FORGOT ABOUT MY BOY, MY BLOOD, MY SON YOUNGGU. DON CARINI, I WILL GO TO KOREA THIS INSTANT AND BRING YOUR SON HOME. THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY, MACHO.

IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT, THEN WE HAVE A PROBLEM. - PROBLEM. - FORGIVE ME, DON CARINI. - I'VE GOT NO PROBLEM. - GOOD! OF COURSE, IT'S UP TO YOU, TONY, TO SHOW HIM THE ROPES, TO GET HIM UP TO SPEED AND TO MAKE SURE HE'S READY FOR THE DAY WHEN HE BECOMES THE CAPO DI TUTTI CAPI. - ( grunting ) - CAPISCE? HO CAPITO.

YOUNGGU'S DECIDED TO TAKE OVER COLLECTIONS AND HE'S ASSERTING HIMSELF IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WHAT'S SO BAD ABOUT THAT? DON CARINI, I HAVE BEEN LOYAL TO YOU FROM DAY ONE. I WOULD NEVER EVER TRY TO BETRAY YOU OR ANY OF YOUR WISHES. ALL DUE RESPECT, I THINK IT WOULD BE WISE TO SEND YOUNGGU AWAY FOR A WHILE. HE'S MY SON. HE'S MY FLESH AND BLOOD! I KNOW. BUT, DON CARINI, YOU GOT TO ADMIT HE'S JUST NOT CUT OUT FOR THIS LINE OF WORK. AND YOU AND I BOTH KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE TOO WEAK TO SURVIVE IN OUR BUSINESS. Man: ONE TWO, ONE TWO. THAT'S IT. DON'T LET UP. HIT THE BODY. - THERE HE IS. - BODY-HEAD. LOOK. HE'S WORKING OUT. GETTING STRONGER. TRYING TO MAKE THE GRADE. MAYBE IT'S NOT AS BAD AS YOU THINK. - YEAH, WE'LL SEE. - DON'T DROP YOUR HANDS. HEY, YOUNGGU. ONE SWING, THREE KNOCKOUTS. GIMME SOME TIME ALONE WITH MY BOY. YOUNGGU, WHAT'S ALL THIS? YOU WANT TIGER? I AM BECOME TIGER. YOUNGGU, WE NEED TO TALK. AS A FATHER, I WANTED TO TEACH YOU EVERYTHING, GIVE YOU EVERYTHING, MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS BUSINESS AIN'T FOR YOU. THIS LIFE IS TOUGH AND ROUGH AND DANGEROUS. OH, YOU MISTAKE. I'M TOUGH AND ROUGH. NO. YOU'VE GOT YOUR MOTHER'S SENSITIVITY. AND THAT CAN BE PUT TO BETTER USE. IT'S JUST THAT YOU ARE NOT CUT OUT FOR THE LIFE. UNDERSTAND. NOT MAKE YOU PROUD. IT AIN'T THAT. LOOK, IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO YOU I COULDN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF. I JUST THINK MAYBE IT'S BETTER IF WE FIND YOU ANOTHER PLACE. YOUNGGU GO? NO. I'LL SET YOU UP IN A FRONT. YOU CAN LIVE THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW LIFE. BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY PLACE FOR YOU IN THE FAMILY BUSINESS. UNDERSTAND. Tony: DON CARINI! DON CARINI-- I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO WAIT OUTSIDE. I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BELIEVE THIS.

BUSINESS IS DOWN. - ( belches ) - OUR OWN SHOPS ARE DYING AND THE CARINI SHOPS WANT TO PAY MORE? YEAH. OUR OWN PEOPLE FROM OUR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD, THEY WANT TO GO OVER TO THE CARINI PART OF TOWN. THEY WANT TO SHOP AND THEY WANT TO DINE OUT OVER THERE. HE'S JUST GOT THIS WAY ABOUT HIM. HE BRINGS OUT THE KINDNESS IN UPSTANDING PEOPLE. NANCY, PLEASE! HE TRIED TO KILL YOUR OWN FATHER! - WHAT? - VINNIE. - THAT CAN'T BE TRUE. - WELL, IT IS TRUE. - I SAW IT WITH MY OWN TWO EYES. - THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE.

NOW WHO IS GOING TO STEP UP AND GIVE ME RESULTS? ( gunshots ) WHEN'S THE OLD MAN GONNA LEARN IT'S BETTER TO LISTEN TO ME? WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER, VINNIE. WHAT DOES SHE SEE IN THAT GUY? HE'S A HALF-BREED. HALF-BREED, LIKE TONTO! - IT'S TIME I MAKE MY MOVE. - BACK TO JERSEY. - GET OUT OF HERE. - WHAT?

GOOD. - LET ME TALK TO THIS ONE. - FINE. VINNIE, IF I EVER HEAR YOU TALKING THAT WAY ABOUT MY NANCY AGAIN, I SWEAR... DON, YOUNGGU'S A WILD CARD. IF YOU ASK ME, I THINK WE NEED TO GET RID OF HIM FOREVER. - I DIDN'T ASK YOU. - HE'S TROUBLE. I THINK WE NEED TO CUT HIM UP IN LITTLE PIECES AND FEED HIM TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD CATS. I DO NOT WANT YOU TO TOUCH HIM. YOU HARM DON CARINI'S ONLY SON, AND THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE FOR HIM TO GO FOR REVENGE. AND THAT'S MY NANCY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND, VINNIE? UNDERSTOOD. NOW GET. ARE YOU SURE VINCENT'S MAKING A PLAY AGAINST DON BONFANTE? HE TRIED TO GET ME TO FLIP OVER TO HIS SIDE. HE SAID THE TWO OF US WOULD TAKE BOTH OF YOU DOWN-- LIKE I WOULD EVER BETRAY YOU.

LOOK, NO, WE SHOULD ALL SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS THIS. - I GOT A BETTER IDEA. COME ON. - WHAT? WHAT, VINNIE? WHAT? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? YOU WANT ME TO SIT AROUND AND DO NOTHING? - WHAT? - JUST FOR NOW, ALL RIGHT? THEY WANT US TO RETALIATE. THEY'RE WAITING FOR US TO RETALIATE. AND WE ARE GOING TO RETALIATE. WE ARE GOING TO HIT THEM WITH EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT. LOOK, NO DISRESPECT, DON BONFANTE, BUT IT'S THE RIGHT TIME, RIGHT PLACE. ON OUR TERMS, NOT THEIRS. HMM. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU'D BE BEHIND THIS, VINNIE. - C'MERE, WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME A KISS? C'MON. - ( spits ) YOU'RE A DEAD MAN. WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GONNA HAPPEN WHEN MY FATHER FINDS OUT YOU'VE KIDNAPPED ME? YOUR FATHER'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO HELP YOU, OKAY?

YOU'RE A MONSTER. - ( mock sobbing ) - YOU'LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH IT. THAT'S THE THING, NANCY. I ALREADY HAVE. ALL RIGHT? AND IT'S REALLY QUITE SIMPLE FROM HERE. YOUNGGU'S DEAD AND CARINI WILL THINK BONFANTE ORDERED IT. AND BONFANTE WILL THINK IT WAS CARINI SEEKING REVENGE. AND I HAVE TO JUST SIT HERE ON THE SIDELINES AND WATCH. AND WHEN I'M THE NEW BOSS, DESPITE YOUR FEISTINESS AND LACK OF APPRECIATION, YOU WILL BE MY BRIDE. I'D RATHER DIE. OH, YOU SAY THAT NOW, BUT YOU KNOW WHEN THIS THING'S OVER WE'RE GONNA HAVE A REALLY GOOD TIME. VINNIE! - ROCCO'S ACTING A LITTLE STRANGE. - WHAT? ( neighs ) I AM THE LONE RANGER! WHOA, SILVER. I SAVED THE PRINCESS AND RESCUED THE TOWN FROM THE EVILS OF THE WORLD. - HEY, ROCCO? - ( sputters ) ROCCO, SNAP OUT OF IT. - LOOK, DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM? - TONTO! HE'S WHACKED OUT OF HIS MIND.

IF WE DON'T RETURN NANCY TO HIM BY NOON TOMORROW, HE'S THREATENING AN OPEN ATTACK. - WE DIDN'T KIDNAP NOBODY. - STILL... WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR TURF. GET THE WORD OUT: NOON TOMORROW AT THE MARKET, I WANT EVERYBODY ARMED AND READY FOR ALL-OUT WAR. DON'T. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS. COME ON, CALM DOWN. YOU'RE A NICE GIRL, NANCY, BUT I GOT ORDERS.
