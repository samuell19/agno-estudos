Vic! Phone! Me? Come quickly. Hurry up. Alo? Poupette! Where are you? At the Salzburg's festival. Playing? No, not this year. I've come to hear one student. And because of Mozart at the same time. Any you, how are you? Terrible. It's a cute family. But I have to drive 20 km every day for my classes. It's a desert here! I've even read "L'Education sentimentale". Come join me here and we'll come back to Paris together. I should be staying 6 more days. And what am I going to say? Oh, that...! Uf... Your 85 year old grand grandmother is on her deathbed! You are crazy... Oh! I've got rheuma but I am still not blind. And your German? Tell me. You know, I've talked a lot in French there. Oh, no, no, no! Your German, the one called... Ulrich. Oh, that one? Yes. Not bad. Tall, slim. He is into philosophy, but no sense of humor. The son of Dracula and Jean-Jacques Rousseau-a. Yes, exactly. And you and Jean-Louis? He'll pick me at the station. His wife is on therapy. I should have told my parents. They expect me on Sunday. They'll be pleased when they see you... Oh, sorry! Never mind. But... Passports. Passport, please. Can you believe it's been a year since I've had a boyfriend. Wait, let me see if you have changed the meaning. Dated or kissed? - Passport, please. - Dated. Thank you. I mean, had a relationship. In Paris, at the gymnasium, at parties... Always the same faces. If I don't meet someone on holidays I won't meet ever. A good one, obviously 16 years. A lot of debils around. Thank you. It's funny, but I have a feeling that I'll never fall in love again. How old are you, 15? And 3 months. It's only an impression then. Can you see him? No, but there's the mother! Mamma, mamma! What are you doing here? And you? Where is Jean-Louis? He couldn't come. Something happened to gym. Jean-Louis? His wife died. Damn. He is so grown-up. How's the dad? We don't see each other a lot, while he's working on his thesis. He won't be happy. I was really bored... What's the matter with you? Not feeling well? Strange, I fell like I've lost a friend. You never knew her. That's correct. It's good news. No more hiding, you can get married. Easy! You can't just do it after 44 years of hiding I am off.

Mum called. - Alo? Excuse me? Ah! OK, I'll try to explain them. Don't you have a picture/ Yes, but they are getting developed. I went to the movies three times. I don't have any money left. I think I've got 50F left. I'll lend you if you want. Great. Want some more toast? It was your father. Could not hear him properly. We are not going? He is busy in Istanbul. I don't mind, but Samantha will be mad. She was a bore before, but after the divorce she is an outstanding one. I am going to the agency. Explain to her. Her bus is coming in the afternoon. And the nervous breakdown? Yes, OK. See you girls. See you. Regarding dad... It must be true. OK, are we going to get the photos? Wait. Hope you did not lose your valet?

Leave the filling and welcome among the lunatics. Thanks. Samantha, someone is ringing. Samantha! - Who is it? - Raoul. Thibault called you? Salut! Ciao. Why did you tell them? Are you wet?

You've come for us, we had a lift ride. Entered the car, exited the car. And you never had a look at my legs? I know your legs - they are beautiful. Yes, but you are not looking at them anymore. You are not looking at me anymore. That's not true. I am, and you are beautiful. But... The reason I was not looking is because I am preoccupied with something... I've brought you here because it is a tradition in our family to eat spaghetti. When serious things are happening. So... I am leaving the practice. Spaghetti al vongole? After I defend my dissertation, Antipasto, signorina. Yes. I want to work in a laboratory. Researching... And nothing else. That's phenomenal. You know what that means. Caries earns much more than mice. Because it does not pay off. I don't understand - are we going to be broke? If this cartoon I am working on succeeds, We'll have a lot of money. By the way, the title is: "39 moles". All the money I earn on my moles... you can spend on your mice. Bon, bah... Maybe it is not right time to tell you... but my travel pass is more expensive. I need more allowance. It is better. I'll tell you. Look. Ciao. You know Fredo? Penelope. Waiting... ...for a friend. He has a red glove. Actually searching for someone to go with me watching one Kurosawa movie. Like Japanese movies? They cry all the time. Makes me depressed. I do. OK. I am leaving you. What time?

I have to ask... It sounds OK. Call me? OK. Ciao. You can go. I don't care. Love, that's a miracle. Èudo. Love, I barely know him. And Penelope... Like him? Yes, maybe. Actually, I still don't know. I wonder... If you do, that means you like him. Regarding Jean-Louis - I was not sure. 3 months he brought me roses, 6 months orchids. I was at the opera And one day, there was no flowers. Though I'll go crazy. I knew that day. Look, Rose Beuret. One of my inspirations She lived for 50 years with Rodin and they were not married. Did you go to his wife's funeral? At my age funerals are frequent. If I were to go, it would be once a month. She's so beautiful. That's me. What? You posed? He lived on the 1st floor. I was 16. I had legs... They are still talking about them. The ones that are still alive. What' his name? Philippe. Is he with Penelope? No. Was he onto her? No. Well, then go out with him. If she is angry, then she's a fool. Write a comment on this quote from Romain Gary. "Patriotism. That is love towards your own." "Nationalism. That is hate towards others." There. Do it for Friday. Vic, if you need a baby-sitter, let me know. I need money for ballet shoes. Listen, Penelope. If you are making a scene, I will cancel it. But stop ignoring me. She can be like that for a long time. Listen darling, you should go see Ann-Marie, my doctor. But, she's a gynecologist. Yes. See, at certain age... We must gain a habit to OK, we'll go if you want. No, you'll go when you want.

"Your Eyes" - Cook Da Books Your eyes Opened wide as I looked your way Couldn't hide what they meant to say Feeling lost ln a crowded room It's too soon for a new love When you smile Your eyes show your heart Lost inside a suit torn apart Feeling alone With people around True love is so hard to find now You think you're so misunderstood I'd explain if only I could Something tells me This time, it's real The way that I feel We'll stop here. Let me see. Let me see. I prefer the one in the passport. You look like a Chinese. Sister of Isabelle Adjani... ...Confucius. And you are doing that? I hear that all the time from my granny. That is from my mother. She finds all the time who resembles whom. She is in Stuttgart. That's why you go to Germany often. How do you know? Ah, from the passport? If I told you I am 2 years older, I would look like a fool. So... Since you know all about me Not all, no. There are vacant spots. Let's sit. Come on. Dive into the dark secrets of my life. Catherine, who is she? A friend. A friend-friend? Or a friend...? Let me tell you, I don't believe in a boy-girl friendship Ah, so! I do. Don't count on me. This is last one. But this is no Vincennes. No, Val de Fontenay. Vincennes, that's opposite direction. My bag! I lost my bag1 Shit! Èekaj. Saved, but that's all I have. No sound. Let me see. Oh! Ah, that's you? - Vic is still not back? - No. But it's 1:20. Can you escort me? A year ago, I don't know what I would give to be with you alone in the car at night, like this. Hum hum. Don't worry, I am not in love with you anymore. That was a substitute for my father who is a reporter. He's never here. My mother's friend told me. He is a psychologist. And school? How is it going? - I don't care. I am trying to enroll into ballet at the Conservatory. It's hart, but Thanks. Until the one of these days... - See you. - See you. Vic? - She's not back? - No. The concert might be still on. She can phone, can't she? Where is it? Pantin or St-Ouen... can't remember Great, your daughter is out and you don't know where. Why didn't you talk to me about that? - I did, but you never listen. That little time you are at home, you are just passing by. 3:10! Shall we call police? Got 50F? Yahoo! Come on. You first. OK, first, the concert... It was great. - Finished late. - It's enough! Firt, one rule! Being sick, having a car accident drugged... and trouble - phone! There's nothing else for you parents. Just problems in life. There are other things that can prevent you from phoning. My bag was stolen. We went on foot. We had no money. Had to hitch-hike. But, that was no problem. Because I was happy. And I did not want to return. Despite knowing that you will be worried and be angry at me. We'll se tomorrow. Bugger off. C'mon, bugger off. The problems are beginning. Why, what happened? She is happy - Vic! - I met a guy. - Really? My mother's son-in-law nephew Is taking me to a fair on Sunday. And you? Tell me. Grounded till Christmas. I've returned after 3. Was it a "Love Story"? More like "Singing in The Rain". Shit, Stéphane! Did it on Saturday. What happened. I waited for you. You did not tell him? I should have called myself. - Really? - Well... 236-41 -94, I called at least 10 times. Really? 96, not 94. So, that's the problem. Let's move, we've got a class. Some other time? OK, sorry. But... Hum... well... Ah! You eyes have a glare. Still in love? Let's talk about me. I have a dilemma. Jean-Louis asked for my hand. - Really? - What shall I do? You had time to think. After 44 years. But, no, he had Geneviève, a nature's miracle. Daughter of Hercule and Pauline Carton. Never dreamt she would kick the bucket first. 10 years younger than me. And him. I can't get married. For a younger man. It does not matter at your age. You are right. And my harps? She has no space for them. - Live at your place? - No. At my place is only at my place. - I have a feeling you don't want to get married. "Marriage is an art where two make problems they never had while being alone." Sacha Guitry or Tristan Bernard. And your parents, how are they? They can join a competition in stress. That wasn't in your time. They are going on each other nerves. I should go. I am playing in Gaveau at 7. One more thing I want to tell you something. Regarding... Remember. We should be ecstatic or miserable. No middle ground. So... Don't rush. Now for me. What's that? We won. - Alo? François, for you. Thanks. Alo? François? I wanted to call you.

Can't imagine, I feel like being your age. That's not always good. You are not OK? - I am. Seen Poupette? On tour south-west. And Philippe? At the hospital. Got injured while boxing. - Nothing serious? No, but is a bummer. He'll lose finale. - Any messages for me? - No. Actually, yes. Gilles called. Wait. Mr Van der Bauer is coming on Friday. Friday, you say? Who is that? A producer from Belgium. And proteoglikoli? I've found the parts. See you are ready for the experiment. We can wait until Friday, but after that is a risk. Start without me. - We worked together for months, and now... Not the first time you seduce one and I finish her. Very funny. Listen... - Till Saturday. - OK, OK. This is nice. You play as I like it.
