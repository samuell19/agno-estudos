"Mondays, it's just us men. My wife's at her mother's. "Gladly. My work here is done. "- No lunch then? - Yes! "So be it: I'm the dupe." ALMOST LIKE THE REST Bravo! You're great. - You liked it? - You were superb. You're so funny. And your man? He's the best. How sweet. - You're making progress. - That's nice. I never tire of seeing you play, honey. I'd like to see you act together. - It's an option. - Yes. We'd like to. So would I. I can't wait to see her onstage again. It's great you're here. It was wonderful to see you at the Angers Festival. Hello. - Didier, Séverine. - Hello. Nice to meet you. - Christophe, Michel. - Sorry. Bravo. Hello? Ok, I'll be right there. It's my sister. Tom can't sleep. - What's wrong? - He won't go to bed, as always. - I'll go. - Stay, let's have dinner. See you soon. Sorry. Bye. - I'll come. - No. Yes. No, stay, have fun. I'm tired anyways. It's me! I'm home. He just stopped crying 2 seconds ago. He's a little scoundrel. Well, honey, what's wrong? There you go. I don't know how you do it. Me neither. He killed me. I love you, but you're a pain. Maybe he's sick. Is he hot? No. You can sleep over if you want. Thanks. Olivier's waiting. Can you babysit him Tuesday? I have an audition. Not Tuesday. Really? I can't miss this. I need to work again. - Any news from daycare? - We're on the waiting list. Ask Mom and Dad. I have a hormone injection. Oh, right. - You'll think of me? - Sure. - I hope it'll work. - Me too. Here's what's ahead of you. Lots of joy... Come on. Thanks. You're welcome. Bye. Let's listen to a story. Come here. "Achoo!", sneezed the little bird. The little bird was very sick. So his little brother and sister huddled near him. His mommy came and said: "He needs some medicine." So his mommy... There you go. Slowly... It's all right. Oh, okay... Well, sweetheart? Honey, what...? You think it's play-doh? Darling? Darling... There's been a small incident. Careful when you turn around. Ok chief? Yeah, watch out. Do the bed. I'll clean him up. Come on, chief. Here baby... Come on. There. I've changed him, he's in our bed. He got it everywhere. Why does he do that? It's the 3rd time. He's an artist. Mrs. Dumas. Hello. Look at me. - He needs to open up. - Say "ah"! Come on, look at me. Say "ah." Look. Say "ah" for mommy. Sit down. Calm down. Come on, sit down. Sit. Say "ah." Look at me. Ah... Wow! - Great. - I see little white dots. Tonsillitis. You took his temperature? No. You know what, Tom? Let me look into your ears. I have a super machine with a little light. - Neat, huh? - Wait. - Let's look at your ear. - Sit. Let's not bother him anymore. Please sit down. He needs antibiotics. He'll never swallow them. He has trouble with bits. I'm worried. Something's wrong with him. - His behavior... - But Tom's in perfect health. Last night he smudged his poop all over. He must have been very angry. Right, Tom? - He doesn't speak. - He'll get there. - Children his age speak. - No. Not all children speak at his age. He walks funny, he doesn't speak, he spits out what he eats. He's not starving to death? He only eats mashed food. He's taking his time. Boys are slower than girls. Look, darling. It's Mom and Dad onstage. See? And the pediatrician? He's taking his time, and boys are slower. Right. He needs time. He's an intellectual. He's observing us. Right, Tom? What? Don't start. You know what? Maybe we worry too much. He's almost 3. - Let's change pediatricians. - It's the 4th one. Let's see a 5th. Sorry. Right, sweetheart? 5th time's the charm. I'm sorry. Wow... You can tell I don't sleep. My face... - You don't sleep? - Not for 3 years. If you want to sleep, don't have children. - He falls asleep at 5 a.m. - Every day? Every day. Tom. Tom! He never turns around when someone calls his name. - Hear how noisy it is? - And an ENT specialist? We're going Friday. He doesn't play with other children. I loved to play by myself as a kid. - I have to go. - Next week, we can't come. We're going to my sister's. I know, I remember. I finally found a nanny. That's great! You'll have some time for yourself. Some "me" time. All right... Go on. - See you later. - See you later. No, you can't eat it. "My husband's lawyer gave me your number. "Sébastien is trying to protect me, but I needed to see you." No. "I needed to talk to you." - Sorry. - It's okay. From the top? "My husband's lawyer gave me..." Sorry. I know it by heart. - Can we talk, Mickaël? - Yes. Be right back. What in the world... She can't stay cool. What will a shooting be like? - She's excellent. - I don't see it. - I've seen her at auditions. - I'm not buying it. - How did it go? - Fine. And you? You'll see. It'll work out this time. The same movie. He loves it! He won't watch any other. Right, Tom? - Is the play done? - No, it's still on. What will you do next? I think we'll go on tour. A few dates. And then, I don't know. Maybe another play. - You have a movie too. - Yes. We'll see. Audrey, what are you up to? Working nonstop. Let's hope it lasts. It's going really well. Didier, you work for a bank? - Yes. - He was my financial adviser. - Really? - She invited me to a play. - And I fell in love. - I bet. That's nice. So! Sorry. I'll be right back. Excuse us. Cheers. We're sorry. - Sorry. - What's going on? He's banging his head with a toy. Why does he do that? Don't ask me. I don't know. We told you to start, go ahead. Go ahead, otherwise... Thanks. - Say hi to Séverine, ok? - Sure. - See you. - Bye. Sorry. Bye. That kid's a nightmare! - He wailed for 3 hours. - The horror. It's why I don't want kids. - Really? You don't? - No. I want at least 12. We'll need to talk. Well, Tom can hear perfectly well. - Are you sure? - Perfect hearing for both ears. He doesn't hear when we talk to him. The test is positive: he can hear. Right, Tom? Tom, you can hear just fine. Tom, look at me. He's angry. He won't turn around when we call him. That's not in my remit. I'm sorry. Come on. Anybody there? Darling, what are you doing? Come here. - Why did you tie him up? - He wouldn't keep still. How long has he been like this? - He spent all day screaming. - So you tied him up? He won't calm down. He won't play. So you tied him up? Your son is weird. What's that supposed to mean? He's not like other kids. And you tied him up. I know my job. Don't teach me my job! You're demented! You need help. Your son is the one who needs help, because he's not normal. Come on, darling. Come on, honey. Raise your arms. Put your head through. There! There, it's over. There, it's done. I'll put on your pajamas. Wait. Take off your shoes. One shoe. Careful, sweetheart. Careful! Ready? It won't be easy to put it on. You don't want to. You won't feel a thing. 1, 2, 3, it's through! Come on... The sleeve. There. And the other! There you go. The bottom now. There! I'm suing, let's call the cops. It's useless. They don't care about nannies. I don't know... Let's call social services. She's dangerous. Tom must learn to communicate. We need to know when he's hurting. He may have spent the whole day screaming and vomiting. Can you imagine? There, there... Listen, we just need to find another nanny. - Tom is ok. - No, he's not. Stop saying he's ok. I'm telling you he's not. What about tomorrow? I'm doing dubbing. When do you leave? I have a read-through, lunch, and I'm meeting my agent. Can you call your mother? Or your sister? I can't spend my life asking them to watch Tom. Come on. We'll find a solution. The solution is I quit working. My great acting career that never started stops here. Stop it... I'm sorry. I can cancel lunch, but not the reading. Don't worry. I'll call my mom. You know what the nanny said? That he isn't like other kids, that he isn't normal. "Not normal"... But tying up a child all day is normal! - She's right. - What? I don't think he's normal. "And your clothes? Should we throw them away? "You'll never save them. "Take care of it. I won't." This isn't ok. We a have a whole movie to dub in 4 days, and you came with your son. I didn't have a sitter. In that case, stay home. - This isn't daycare. - I'm really sorry. I'll call my mom. No, go home. I'll call on someone else. I'm sorry. - Hello. - Hello. Come on, big guy. Hello. Tom's dad. Very well. Here's Tom. And you are? - Tom's mom, Séverine. - I thought you were his sister. A good start! Come in. Why didn't you breastfeed him? No suckling reflex. He couldn't find the breast. His head tilted backwards. It was very complicated. If you weren't able to breastfed him, it may be a problem, or even the problem. What is your age difference? 27 years. Nothing is anodyne. A seemingly benign event can have a huge impact on a child's development. You both share a passion for the theater, but you may prefer to live the life of your characters rather than real life. You're not you: how can he be him? Pardon? You're not you. So how can he be him? Yes. I'll be right there. Excuse me one moment. I have a bad feeling. He's a specialist. He may know what's wrong. "A specialist"? That's your mother talking. - My mother? - It's okay, he's great! Stop it! Let's go. I've had enough. - Stop. - Yes, darling. Let's go - You're too much. - Come! Quick! Séverine and Christophe are at the pedopsychiatrist's. At the least scratch you get, you go see a shrink. With our girls, we never... I have to go. There they are. Bye. - Come on! Raise your legs. - Here we go! So, what did he say? According to him, Tom found a way to draw our attention. And succeeded. For what I have to say. He hinted towards our age difference, my hair, the C-section. Tom is a spoiled child, with too much stimuli, tyrannizing us. Is that it, Tom? It makes sense. This is very interesting bullshit, but I have work. - See you. - See you. - Bye. - Thanks again. To sum up, everything's ok. "What? "He knows him? "Better than anyone. What's his name? "- How should I...? - Yes. His name is Ponta... "- 'Ponta' what? - Possible. "- Pontagnac! - Pontagnac? You? "Yes, by God! It was I! "It was I. "Prankster!" - Let's go this way. - No. Why not? We're going towards civilization, shopping. 3 years of mom's look is enough. - But Tom's going to scream. - He decides? A one millimeter change and he'll scream. Want proof? Don't worry darling, we're taking the same route. I can't believe this! Whichever way, it's the same thing. If it's the same, what's the problem? - And the baby? - We have to start over. I'm sorry. - I'm so sick of it. - I can imagine. No, you can't. You became pregnant just after meeting Christophe. We struggled for years. We're in the same service for yet another IVF. We see pictures of people for whom it worked out, with their smiling babies. It's unbearable. People's empathy drives me mad. Do you resent my pregnancy? No, but don't say you understand what I'm going through. What is that? Doctors say he's fine. Can't you get over it? Is he like other kids? I don't know, I don't have any. Something's wrong with him. Why isn't anyone listening? Because you're being a drag! You should go to a shrink, really. What? Since Tom's birth, you're exhausted. If you're not well, how could he be? F. LEHMANN PSYCHIATRIST ? BY APPOINTMENT ONLY - Hello. - Hello. My husband couldn't come. He's on tour. I wish he would be here. Okay, I'll tell him. My son stayed with my mother. Should he have come? No. We're here to talk about you. I don't know what to say. Start by telling me why you came. - I don't know where to start. - Try. A nanny said Tom's abnormal. Why do you think she said that? Do you think the same thing? Can you tell me how your pregnancy went? I was ill. - What happened? - I had a pyelonephritis. - A kidney infection. - They operated on my right kidney. I was bedridden until the end of my pregnancy. Before even being born, Tom had a tough time. - Is that your son? - Yes. Look, he's bleeding! Darling, what's wrong? Did another child hurt him? He did it to himself. He hits himself with sticks. Or else, throws them at others. Why didn't you say anything? Look at your reaction. Next time, I won't say a thing. Does it hurt when I touch it? Where does it hurt? Let's go to the swings. "My wife is at her mother's. "Gladly! "My work here is done. "- No lunch then? - Sure! "So be it: I'm the dupe." - You're dinning with us? - No. Celebrate closing night! I don't know, we'll see. You'll be ok? Yes. I'll be ok. Remember the shrink? Oh, yeah. - Do I have to go? - Yes. - What's wrong? - I don't want to tell my life to someone I don't know. Christophe... Séverine... You promised. Yes, I promised. You smell of alcohol. Sorry. I want you. Here, now? Yes. "Here, now." That's crazy. - Sure? - I don't know. - A little or very crazy? - You'll see. It's true Tom is slower than other children. - He's starting to walk better. - Barely. - He can't walk very well. - But he's walking. His behavior... is strange. - But he's still young. - He's over 3. He should talk, dance, run, climb up and down the stairs, throw a ball around, play with other kids. Your husband is right. Tom is too young to jump to conclusions. He's developing late, but... I don't know. Maybe we missed something. We missed something? You're too much. I understand why you didn't want to go. Maybe we're doing it wrong, we should try another way. - Maybe Tom is a difficult child. - These aren't tantrums. You're in total denial. When you say "we missed something," you mean "we" or "I"? Everyone's saying I'm doing things wrong, I'm too invasive, over-protective. - It's my fault? - No. I don't know. I can't tell anymore. I'll get some bread. Pick me up down the street. Mom, it's us! Mom, why don't you answer? What's wrong? - What's wrong? - Everything's fine. "Everything's fine"? I... I left the stool in his room, near the window. I just turned my back... I caught him a the last minute. He's fine. I told you the void attracts him! I'm sorry. I called him, but he didn't answer. I swear, I called him. He didn't react. He was leaning again the rail, looking into the void. I couldn't scare him. I came up behind him very slowly. I caught him. He was on the brink of falling. You can't take your eyes off him. I told you. It's ok. He doesn't look traumatized. Listen, I can't babysit him anymore. Don't say that. I need you. I'm trapped if you can't watch him. Please, Mom, no. Put him in daycare. I've been waiting for months. I can't do it. I'm sorry, I can't. I have loved you for so long Never will I forget you Sing, mockingbird, sing Good job, honey. Maybe we can go If I move my arm He'll wake up I would that the rose Were still on its briar I have loved you for so long Never will I forget you Quick, before he wakes up Come on, Tom, stop. Tom, please! No. Hush... Stop! Don't touch the napkin. Keep the napkin. That's enough. Here. There. No, don't spit it out. No, Tom! Stop it! I can see where this is going. That's enough now. Stop messing around. What's wrong with you? I'm changing methods. - By yelling at him? - Yes. - We won't cave in. - It's useless, see. Don't spit it out! Enough! - Stop. - What kind of life is this? Do you understand? I know, but stop yelling. It's not helping. Here, watch. Watch. Honey... We got accepted in daycare, sweetheart. I'm so relieved. Hurry up. We'll be late at the shrink's. - I don't want to go anymore. - Christophe... I'm not going. It's useless. I'm tired of hearing reproaches. And I'm tired of hearing Tom walks funny because I was in love with my Latin teacher. He claps his hands because his dad's an actor. Or because I didn't breastfeed? No, don't spit. - How much? - 5 euros, please. Keep the change. Thanks. - We'll take care of him. - I'm sure. Here's his toys. It calms him down, mostly this one. Don't worry. Maybe he won't play with the others. It'll be fine. - Here. - See you later. Yes. We're waiting. Where are you? We're late. Why? Okay, I see. You could warn. - What? - The sitter's not coming. - Why? - She's scared. Tom frightens her. Another one bailing on us! - Go, I'll stay with Tom. - No. It's best. I have work anyways. You're sure? Go, it'll take your mind off things. You're beautiful. Bye, darling. Have fun, but not too much. I won't go into details, but when he tells it... I can't tell it. - Seen Séverine? - No. No? Hi! It's mommy. - So, how was it? - Great. - You had fun? - I feel better. Really? - What about you? - I'm ok. We're not tired. Right? No, no, no... How can we have sex? We'll draw out the secret weapon like usual. I can't wait. Can you imagine? Going back onstage. - When do rehearsals start? - Next Monday. We'll start when Christophe comes home. - What about the baby? - It'll be before I show too much. Oh no, Virginie... That's how it is. - You'll work things out. - I've lost hope. Don't! I lost hope, but everything's working out. Tom at daycare, the play... And with Christophe. I'm exhausted. - The shots don't work. - It'll work. What will? Stop saying it'll work. It doesn't! I'll put out the trays. - One or two? - One. My baby's watching his weight. - It's not working. - It's worse. Did you ever try letting him cry? Yes. Thanks. We tried, it doesn't work. He can cry for hours. I feel he's always testing you. Séverine is right to worry. I've never seen such a child. You weren't like this. Stop saying that. It's his personality. They must have their fun, at daycare. You'll see with your kids. I won't let them boss me around. - You're a shrink now? - Come on. It's to lighten the mood. It's always about Tom. "Tom did this, he did that..." How will you manage with a 2d? You can't raise one. Don't start fighting! It's Sunday. - Mashed potatoes, anyone? - Me. Maybe you have relationship issues, so you blame Tom. - And the shrink? - It's over. Why? - Actually, you're jealous. - Not at all. Now stop. Yes. Because I'm having a 2d child. I'm sorry for having kids. You should see a shrink. - Séverine, You're going too far. - Me? It's false. I'm happy for you. But two is complicated. With one... Virginie's delighted for you. We'll just see when your kid walks funny or throws up all he eats. Why have another? If he has Tom's illness, what will you do? Virginie! It's what everyone's thinking. It's not for you to say. Séverine. Séverine! "Don't put any value on a thing "my love finds unworthy of you. "Here comes the master. "- A little farther, Madame. - What? "- One step, if you please. - What is it? "Step back for the third. "No, Madame, no..." That's good. - Right. - "Monsieur is very knowledgeable." But not his lines. What's the first one? - It's... - From the top. "A little farther." - Do we start over? - From the top. - So... - Do I kiss him? No. No kiss. Go on. "- A little farther. - What? "One step back." I have a huge headache. Good evening! - How did it go? - Great. He fell asleep. - Asleep? - Yes. Really? That's good. What time is it? 9 p.m.? So that's 5 hours. - Yes, that's it. - Perfect. - Right. - Thanks. He's asleep. - How did you do it? - He's been good. I just put him to bed. He ate. - He ate? - Yes. - Then we played... - You played? Yes! Then I put him to bed and he was fast asleep. You played games? - Yes. - Here. Thank you, Claire. Yes! Please. We'll be in touch, anyways. - There. - Ok. - Thanks. Good night. - You too. - Good night. - Thanks. It's too good to be true. He's asleep. Asleep! - I can't believe it. - It's true! Daycare, the play, and Tom sleeping! This is too much. Let's watch a DVD. - Give me an aspirin. - Ok. - What do you want to watch? - A comedy. Death in Venice. You finished the cough syrup? No, I didn't touch it. Tom? Tom? Tom! Come on. Come on, let's go. - So? - It's ok. They pumped his stomach. Is he awake? No. They'll keep him all night in intensive care. I'm going to kill that babysitter. I swear! And I gave her 20 euros... What an ass! Stop it. Go home. It's best that one of us get some sleep. No way. I'm staying with you. "As M. Jourdain said, "I wish that this meal were more worthy of you. "I'll answer the compliment by eating. "Oh... What beautiful hands! "My hands are mediocre. "You're talking about the lovely diamond. "Madame, God forbid me from doing so. "It is unworthy of a gentleman. "The diamond is not much." Sorry. It's mine. - The one time you're good. - Yes. Yes, it's me. What's going on? - What's going on? - I'm on my way. I have to go to the daycare center. - Can't it wait? - Apparently not. - I'll be right back. - Ok. Meanwhile we'll work on another scene. What happened? - Tom bit another child. - Jeez... He bit him hard. The child's at the ER. - Is he ok? - He will be. I calmed the parents, but this isn't the 1st time. Tom has started banging his head, he isn't potty-trained... Children become dry to please their parents. Is everything ok with your husband? We're fine. Listen, Tom isn't adapting well to daycare. He isn't interested in activities, he always needs someone. We can't watch him nonstop. I can't leave this way! Yes, but Tom disrupts the other children's lives. It'll be difficult to keep him. I can't have a child endangering other children. I waited months for this slot. He should stay home with you. He's disrupting his own life and other's. - You're kicking him out. - No. He disturbs you, so you kick him out! Do you want what's best? Of course! That's a place in the community with others! What if a more serious accident happens. What then? - May I use your bathroom? - Down the hall. - Ok? - Yes. That's it for today. Ok. Thank you. - See you, Cathy. - Bye! What are you doing here, chief? Séverine dropped him off. - She didn't say where she went? - No. Where's mommy? Huh? Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? - What are you doing? - They won't keep Tom at daycare. Really? Why? He's violent. They can't manage. It's too demanding. It's their job to watch over kids. Even they don't know how to handle him... Tom isn't normal. - Don't start again. - But you're in denial. He's not like the rest! That's not it. I love him the way he is. I'm glad my grandson isn't like the rest. He's unique is all! I love him the way he is. Go on up. Get some rest. She's here. Don't worry. I'll tell you. It's me. Are you ok? Hush, Séverine is sleeping. Christophe, Liliane's just arrived. I'll call you back. What's this? No. Stop! Séverine, stop. Stop it, Séverine. Stop! Stop. Stop, stop... So? More? Mom. - They can't kick him out. - They're not. The director is strongly suggesting I take him out. And the play? Huh? He can't stay in daycare? Can't we hire a lawyer? We'll sue them... He hurts others, he doesn't sleep. It's not good for him. He isn't happy. You want your son to be somewhere where he isn't happy? Here. There. How's that? Come on... Wait. Look. Come on. I don't want a 2d child. I want an abortion. No. No way. What if he's like Tom? Tom is fine. He's perfect. You'll take the risk? With you, I'll take any risk. Let me put a hat on your head. It won't hurt. With your arm... - Slowly. - Here. Look at me. There. Great. All right, Tom. I'll hold his hand that way. He's too agitated. I'll calm him. I have other things to do. Call me when it's done. Any idea what he may be wrong? Tom probably has a form of myopathy. We'll need complementary exams. It's probably in that area. Myopathy? Schedule an appointment. - Is myopathy genetic? - Why? Are you pregnant? Yes. The reception's over there. Hurry, the schedule's full until January. All right. Stop, stop... - Wait... - No. Stop. All right! That's enough bullshit. Come on! I'm sick of these doctors. We have to stop. We have to stop! Séverine! Séverine. Are you ok? Are you ok? Come on... Let's let mommy sleep. "Myopathy patients "suffer from a generalized muscle weakness "predominant in the limbs' base, "the neck, thorax and abdomen. "Their face is characteristic: "lack of expression, dropping upper eyelids, "constantly open mouth, "a tented upper lip..." I can't recognize Tom. Me neither. Maybe it's how he'll become. It's not about behavior. There's no connection. He can die before age 10? No! This is bullshit. It's not myopathy. His mouth isn't constantly open, with an tented upper lip, and his eyes... See? It's true... What's so funny? You. I'm sorry. I was stupid. I'm sorry. I'm afraid he'll die. What are you talking about? Come on. I saw a documentary on TV the other day. Then I searched the Internet, American websites... Olivier bought a computer, I'm really pumped up. It read: "Late smiling or absence thereof, "apparent indifference to others and to sound stimuli, "absence of response to one's name, "solitary activities, "late language skills, unusual object attachment, "unusual body movements, "intolerance to change." What is that? - A list of symptoms. - About what? There's a tape. ...that it may be so. There's no possible comparison. It's like they're not the same child. 4 times 5? Once taken charge of, the children can be practically normally schooled. The progress isn't immediate. There's no miracle. It's the result of a lot of work marked by small and big victories. I've never known him like this. You think Tom is autistic? Maybe he is. I'm not sure. When I watched the documentary, the children reminded me of him. All of us were wrong. You were right. We need to search here. No doctor ever mentioned autism. They look for diseases, and this isn't one. It's a handicap. - Can you read the symptoms? - Yes. "Late smiling or absence thereof "apparent indifference to others and to sound stimuli "absence of response to one's name, solitary activities..." Can you watch Tom for an hour? What for? "As M. Jourdain very well said, "I wish that this meal were more worthy of you. "I'll respond to the compliment by eating. "Oh... What beautiful hands. "My hands are mediocre. "You're talking about the lovely diamond. "Madame, I..." Can we take a break? It's the run-through. I really need a break. Let's take a break. What's up? - I know what's wrong with him. - Who? Tom? He's autistic. - What do you mean? - He has all the symptoms. He can't be autistic. It's impossible. - It's not it. - It is. I know what it is. That can't be it. This is nonsense. No, but... It's impossible. They would have told us. All the doctors we saw are doctors! They would have noticed, and told us! - Who told you? - Virginie. Virginie... What does she know about it? No... Why didn't you tell me Tom was autistic? Look, I'm with a patient. Why didn't you say anything? Who told you he was autistic? I searched the Internet. You can find anything on the Internet. I need to know. Is he autistic? It's impossible to tell yet. At his age, it's too soon... He has to speak first. I have to go... Is he or is he not autistic? When he'll speak, we'll see what he has to say. Is there a treatment to help him? I'll tell you the truth. Forget the child of your dreams. It's best for all of you. He's locked himself in for the past 3 days. - Remember Gilles? - Yes. One of his kids is autistic. - I left him a message. - Thanks. Open up or I'll break down the door! On 3, I'm coming in. One, two... You're letting us down. It's not fair to your partners but never mind. Tonight, the premier, the press... It's over if we don't have our international star. I'm worried you don't smile when I say "international star." Of course I'll come. Tom will end up in a psychiatric ward, force-fed pills. Why's that? That's what autism is like. Kids are locked up in hospitals, tied to their beds and force-fed pills. To help Tom, you need to stop being depressed, and to do that, you need to work. For yourself, for him... and for me. "- One step, if you please. - What is it? "Step back for the third. "Madame, M. Jourdain is very knowledgeable. "Madame, it is a very great honor "to be fortunate enough, "to be so happy as to have the joy, "that you should have the goodness to grant me "the honor of..." He'll never speak? I don't know. When will you see the specialist? - In a month. - Not before that? No, not before that. These repetitive gestures and moans have increased, no? I thought of something. - What if we went without you? - Yes. Take the same route as usual. Left sidewalk on the way there, right sidewalk on the way back. - Right? - Yes. It'll be fine. It's just Tom. Breath. Roméo, come on. - Hello, Séverine. - Hello, Gilles. - Hello, Séverine. - Hello, Roméo. - How are you? - Good, and you? - Good. My name's Roméo. - Hello, Roméo. - Do you have children? - Yes. I have one. - What's his name? - His name is Tom. - Do you have a 2d child? - The 2d is here. - What's his name? - I don't know yet. Gabriel? Maybe Gabriel, I don't know. Can we play pool? - Can we? - Yes. Come. Show me how you play pool. Thanks. I'll call the association. It's very helpful. There's group therapy for parents on Thursday evenings. I'll tell Christophe. He couldn't come today. He works a lot. Bye, Roméo. - What do you say? - Bye, Séverine. - I love you! - Me too. - Can we hang onto each other? - Later. Bye. Thanks. We'll see each other soon, ok? Bye. - In how many days? - Soon! I Promise. - See you soon, Séverine! - See you soon! Do you realize? I have to count on you. - You can count on me. - Apparently not. It won't happen again. You feel sorry for yourself. I feel bad enough already. Don't add to it. - Should I be ecstatic? - That's not what I'm saying. What about me? I don't know. - You're stronger than I am. - I'm not strong at all! I'm overwhelmed. So am I. I want to give up. I'm scared. I'm scared too. I don't know what to do. We'll find out. Look. Gilles gave me this. He gave me some leads. I wanted to tell you about it before calling. - Is there a treatment? - Not really. In the USA, they have the ABA method. It helps live with the handicap. - Does it work? - It can. That's how Roméo, Gilles's son, can communicate. Christophe, I want to fight, but not alone. You're leaving me? No at all. Why? Are you crazy? I'll never leave you. I love you too much. If you love me, stop drinking. You choose. No. The salad stays here. Here! Could I talk to you, please? Sure, no problem. Come here. My son is autistic... and I feel it's my fault. Your fault? - Why would it be your fault? - I don't know. Since I know he's autistic, I think it's my fault, that my wife didn't deserve this. If she hadn't met me... So I think: "What awful thing did I do "that God should send this ordeal our way?" If God has sent you this ordeal, as you say, it's that He believes you're strong enough for it. What will he become? You're here. I'm not that young. I won't always be there. You're here today. You're in perfect shape. God does not send us what we want, you know. He sends us what we need. Yes, hello? Yes. Where is she? Yes. I'll be right there. - She's awake, waiting for you. - Thanks. My love... - How do you feel? - All right. - What happened? - You fainted. They brought you here. Gilles called me. Oh yes... I was at the conference on autism with Gilles. Yes. Did you see a doctor? Yes. They want to keep you a couple of days. I'm sure it's nothing. I'm tired is all. The baby is fine. Sweetheart, I... I'm sorry, I was so stupid. Do you forgive me? At the conference, a woman talked about the ABA method. I'm sure it can work for Tom. Ok. We'll start whenever you want. This is 24/7. - Are you ready? - I'm ready. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. A film based on the true story of Gersende and Francis Perrin. Diagnosed at age 3, their son Louis can now communicate with others. Subtitles: Eclair Media
