I like that my parents separated. I play baseball with my dad now. We've become closer. My dadz allerzzic to dogz. Hold on... My dad's allergic to dogs so since I've been in joint custody, I have one with my mom. I love having two rooms, two closets, two Christmases, two birthdays. My mom was not a very good cook. But my step-mom is really good. I don't see my little sister as often, which is cool because she's so annoying! HOW TO GET YOUR PARENTS TO DIVORCE -Forget about it! -Don't start that again. I don't want us to be late to the law office again! What are you doing? We have to go now! You're impossible. You're being slow on purpose. You know I'm stressed and tired, but you just keep doing it. Work less, you'll be less stressed. I don't have it, I gave it to you yesterday. -Your lawyer's robe needs cleaning. -My robe! I got this, thanks. -Hurry up. -Where's the robe? You think you're this great lawyer but you can't find your robe. I don't need it, today's Saturday. Now you're just pushing my buttons. Justine? Justine, we have to go now. I'm old enough to stay home alone. We don't have time to argue, c'mon, let's go. I hate coming to your work. I can stay here, I'm not a baby! By the way, did you call the shrink back? You say yourself there's no point in talking about it. What are you playing at? FORM FOR AN AMICABLE DIVORCE -What? -Coming, sweetie? This isn't like you, Justine. The year is almost over and we have two things to discuss. The talent show, worth five points on your mark, and the final evaluation. Good morning, Guillaume. Stay back at recess, we'll have a little talk. As you know, the final evaluation is an oral presentation... Ernestine Lafontaine just puked! -Vomit Fountain! -Shut up, you guys. Justine the Sardine swimming in a fountain of puke! Screw you, Guillaume. -Screw you Guillaume. -You're such a turd. What's going on back there? -So many boxes! -It's always like this. I can tell your parents aren't separated. How long have you had that? Since we planned the move, my dad's been spoiling me. When do you move in with your mom? After the prom. She wants me there for the summer. My dad had me for elementary school, so high school is with my mom. You didn't pack your Rocky t-shirts. He'd never leave them here. He even showers in them. You took my favourite t-shirt. Theo, listen to this. Not like that. Look, you gotta make a regular beat. What do I do with this? It doesn't work. Hello honey. -Are your son's friends here? -Yeah. A real kiss. -I love you. -Me too. Look, I don't want to do this anymore. Hi sweetie. We'll let your dad drive. Mom? Yes? Are you going to eat with us? Yes, I'll be right there. FORM FOR AN AMICABLE DIVORCE The Court of Quebec has a Youth Division. It hears cases relating to the safety and development of people under the age of 18. Registration for the talent show is open. Mime, magic, theatre, poetry, you know. Registration forms are here. I'll take two. Thank you. Stupid talent show. Claudia. I'm going to Montreal at lunchtime. You're serious? There's a Youth Court. I'll ask for a divorce for my parents. C'mon. It's okay if you don't agree, but don't rat me out. Hey girls, are you doing the show? It's too childish. You're leaving? She's going to the city. To get a divorce for her parents. Justine, you can't do that! -I'm going along. -What? She's not gonna change her mind. The city's too dangerous, I have to go. Sit everyone, I'll be back. Why is Theo looking weird? Whatcha doin', Theo the Dodo? -Girls, wait up! -Theo! Hurry up! Last call for Montreal. Hello. I wish to file for my parents' divorce. -You're the one who filled it out? -Yes. What do you want me to do with this? I want my parents to divorce so I need help from the court. This is a court for youth, right? I'm sorry, but that isn't how it works. Children cannot break up a marriage. Kids are part of the marriage and I don't like the marriage anymore. So what do I do? C'mon, help her out. This is serious. You have other resources. You could try the Kids Help Phone, or speak with your school psychologist. You do go to school, right? Yeah, but today's a Ped Day. Yeah. Wait here. I think you need to speak with someone. I'll see if an SW is available. What's an SW? A social worker. They take kids away from their parents. Let's scram. The Youth Court can't help? Screw that. There's gotta be some kind of justice for kids. Before, you had a spark in your eye. -What do you mean? -A spark? I mean now you're sad and we're going to help you. For sure. I don't have enough. -Nothing. -Me neither. We could sign up for the talent show. You said it was too childish. Not if we use it to hold court. We'll pretend it's a play, but for us it'll be a real court. -It'll be epic. -You bet. We'll take justice into our own hands. We can't get caught. The guard's not looking...go! Shit. Mom's gonna kill me. I swear we didn't do anything stupid. -Yeah, the girls got hurt, so... -C'mon, we'll talk at home. Come on, Justine. Your parents are still in court, and they're not pleased. They said to wait for them at home. Just so you know, Theo and I said we were at the park. We didn't mention Montreal, and we never will. What's up? You've lost that spark in your eye. It's just that I hear something weird. Go check it out. Justine, I can't see anything. Sorry. It's coming from the room set up for Olivia? Well, it's kinda behind the door. Well, open the door. Who's there? Open it! Hey, I still can't see! Work less, you'll be less stressed out. My parents are home, I gotta go. Bye. You're representing half of this town's homeless people, of course you'll burn out. -Well, you just take the safe cases. -What? What's this about playing hooky? -I was late. -Don't try that. Where were you all afternoon? Where were you for supper? Justine. I was at the courthouse. To ask for your divorce. C'mon Justine. Find a better excuse than that. Were you at the park? I'm telling the truth. You guys fight all the time, it's awful. We don't fight, we debate. That's how lawyers talk to each other. Tell us where you were or there will be consequences. Okay then, I was at the skate park. Hey, are you guys going to the prom with anyone? Aren't we all going together? I almost wiped out! -You sure it's abandoned? -Yeah. The owner broke up with my mom to move to Alma, so no worries. How many boyfriends has she had? Like, a thousand. Whatcha doin'? Whatever. It's clear, you can come. Wow, it's amazing. So cool! This'll be the perfect place to plan the court hearing in secret. A judge is like a referee. Like your brother? You know he won't be interested. I don't want any of these roles. I'd rather organize. And me, I could be your lawyer? Sure! My lawyer's Theo and the organizer is Clo. We have to find my parents' lawyer and the judge. I might know how to get my brother to be the judge, but I'd have to go home first. I got it. -You know what this is, right? -Um... yeah, of course. It's a huge bat. If I rat him out, he'll be in shit. That'll convince him. That's enough. You two can't be on the ice. Claudia takes to the ice. She and C-A face off in a first offensive. Icing is called, C-A dodges the attack. Body check. Time out for Claudia. She's in a bad way. New face-off. Shot blocked. All hell breaks loose. Wait! Claudia's going all in. The gloves are off! Shot blocked, Claudia's ahead. She's skating hard, catching up to him. The tension is building... And she scores! Hi. You alone? The only person we're missing is your parents' lawyer. -And I have an idea. -What? We'll find one at the oral presentations tomorrow. What do you think? I wanted to say good night. Don't talk too long, okay? -I hope she didn't hear. -You have headphones. I can't wait to see you tomorrow. Me too. Let's start with Ariel and his cat. PARENTS' LAWYER: ? I choze a ferret and hiz name is Zuzube. I said "Shushube", you know, like the candy. Jujube! Don't hurt yourself! The mallard is the traditional name for the wild duck. It is identified by the green on its head and neck. The mallard is not afraid of humans... Yuck! Our lockers are gonna stink. Enough. We have other presentations. The stallion is a horse... ...strong... Besides, "The Italian Stallion" is Rocky's nickname. Y'know, the boxer. That's why I chose it. The stallion loves to reproduce. Guillaume! JUSTINE'S LAWYER: ---- Stallions are also... Mayflies live three years as larva. Then they hatch, they meet someone... They do "the deed". They don't love for long. The females just have time to lay their eggs before dying. Shoot, they're dead. Anyway, if I had to change lives, I'd never be a mayfly. Thanks. You're next, Guillaume Garcia-Deschamps. That was a cute presentation, Justine the Sardine. But my animal, the bonobo, doesn't die after 30 seconds. Especially not after having done "the deed". He screws every 90 minutes and lives to be 40. The same age as Ms. Laporte. Don't stray from the subject. The females form a circle and present their buttocks. The male chooses from the group. You know, humans and bonobos are very much alike. Our genetics are 98.7% similar to theirs. That could be my grade, Ms. Laporte. Focus, Guillaume. Well, he's the most intelligent animal, and the only animal to lie on top of the other while making love, just like our parents. Guillaume Garcia-Deschamps! Anyways, if I had to change lives, I'd be a bonobo! JUSTINE'S LAWYER: GUILLAUME Thanks. Guillaume was good, eh? Yeah, amazing. So maybe he should be the lawyer. No, he's too good for your parents. Exactly. Maybe he should be the other lawyer. Not the one for my parents. Don't we hate the guy? He failed two grades. He's unreliable. You really want to be stuck with him? Anyway, he'll probably say no. But can we agree to at least ask him? Okay. Who should we pick for the parents' lawyer? We could ask Ernestine, she'll say yes. It's a dirty trick to give that vomit fountain to the parents. C'mon Ernestine, you can't just sit and read every recess. Look, we'll find you someone to go to the prom with. Who do you want to go with? -No one would go with me. -We'll find someone. Theo wants to. Yup, that's cool, it'll be fun, for real. Okay. Deal. I know you're almost failing. This is worth five points on your report card. You wouldn't be held back again. I have two conditions. Okay, but it can't have anything to do with my physical integrity. Don't worry, Sardine, you're not my type. You don't argue with my methods, and you never ever come to my house. Okay. Deal. So what do I do? ORGANIZER JUDGE PARENTS' LAWYER JUSTINE'S LAWYER WITNESS It's perfect. It's a mess in here. Hey, we're up here. Not bad, Sardine. Hi Theo. Theo's going to the prom with Ernestine? Kissy, kissy... Listen up. The teacher knows we're doing a Youth Court. But she thinks it's a play, not a real court. So we have to hide the fact that we have real defendants. Yes? Isn't it mean to do this to the parents in front of the whole school? That's what her parents do for work: talk about problems in front of others. And they say everyone has the right to justice. They'll get that we want it too. All evidence must be kept secret. Not one word to Justine's parents, clear? Yes? How can I defend the parents if I can't talk to them? You can, but not about the trial or the fact that they're accused. Everything else is fair game. The show is on June 15 at 3PM, so we have the whole week to get ready. We have one hour. Do you mind keeping a lookout in case my parents return? No problem. C'mon, Theo. Thanks. Can I take this? Sure, my parents have two. Hey! What are you doing? -What's in here? -Close the door. No one goes there. -I need all the evidence! -It's not relevant to the trial. Come on, move. Justine, come here. -What? -Come. Next time your parents argue, record them. -Almost done? -Yeah. Here's the list of what I took. Justine? Justine? What? Did you brush your teeth? There's no more toothpaste. Hello. Dad? Yes. Can you hear me? Ernestine? -Wait mom. -I can't find my webcam. I can't hear you and I can't reach your mom. I want to talk to your dad. I can't find my webcam. It's glitchy. I think it's not working. Tickets for the talent show. Don't forget to give them to your parents. If you haven't started on your sets yet, do it. The show's coming up fast. Come, I want to show you something. Here. A meeting of Children of Divorce Anonymous. All kids with divorced parents are invited for a public consultation on June 13 at 5PM. "Free pizza"? You'll see. After that meeting, we'll have lots of evidence that divorce is a good thing. I can't buy the whole school pizza! They won't all come. Not all parents are divorced. One family in two. Forty percent, according to Statistics Canada, Sardine. Stop calling me that, Guillaume the... Guillaume the Chromosome. Seriously, how are we gonna pay for the pizza? I have a plan. Look what the cat dragged in. Hey Dad, could you sponsor some pizza for us? It's for school. You know I don't make the decisions. But I'll ask, okay? Have you eaten? -No. -Want a slice? -Here you go, Miss. -Thanks. This spot is perfect. Hi girls! Want me to give you fishtail braids? In exchange, you have to help me with a top-secret project. Turn around, I'll do your hair. -I called and it's a go for the pizza! -You're great. -Yeah, I know. -That's so cool. My dad got us a sponsor. It's coming together. Relax. So awesome. -Check out our spot. -Nice. So what do we do? We'll get more later. For now, we're painting. We've already painted a few, they need to dry. -Hey! -I'm her lawyer. Request for access to Mr. and Mrs. Beaulieu, failing which, strict procedures will be initiated. You have 48 hours. We're not allowed to talk to her parents, that's the rule. I won't mention the court. But according to chapter R1 B3, I have the right to speak to my clients. What do we do? Are your parents okay with you having friends over for supper? The problem is that your dad's cheating on your mom. What are you talking about? -We just gotta get him to admit it. -Come on. Her mom is just still depressed about Oli. -Who's Oli? -Doesn't matter. Hey kids. You just want one burger each? Yup. Your burgers are really good. -Yeah, delicious. -Thanks. -It's nice of you to invite us. -Yup, thanks again. It's our pleasure. -Here. -Thanks. So, how's your show going? It's going well. -I'm sure you'll like it. -I can't wait. How'd you meet? Jeez, it was so long ago. In college. We were so young. My dad always said it's not good to couple up too early in life. Better to get lots of experience first so that you're not tempted to look elsewhere. -Your dad says that? -And you guys? Do you look elsewhere? No, we're good. It shows, you're great together. Was it love at first sight? I read that love at first sight can make sparks at first, but it doesn't make for a strong couple. I think you seem deeply in love. How long have you been together? -About... -Twenty years. Yeah, twenty years. Twenty years! That's a long time. There must be rough and boring patches once in a while? With Justine around, we're fulfilled. It's certainly not boring. Not boring at all. -Don't worry. -Where are the rags? There should be some there. That'll do. Don't worry, it's okay. Excuse me, I need to use the bathroom. -It's just to the left. -It's a number two, I'll go upstairs. Just sop it up and we'll take care of it later. -Goodbye. -Thanks very much, bye. Thanks for inviting us, you really are a lovely couple. Hurry up, Mom's waiting for us. C-A, you're so annoying. C-A, your brother's the judge? Hurry up, C-A's driving us. It's not cool that he's the judge. I'm not going with him, that's corrupt. What are you doing? How'd you get up? Every house has a ladder. -The iPod has enough battery? -I think so. Good. Come on. We'll find a good spot, but don't forget to get it tomorrow. Her door's closed, she must be sleeping. She didn't talk much tonight, eh? Not compared to her friends. They sounded like lawyers interrogating us. Do you think Guillaume is Justine's boyfriend? They couldn't stop looking at each other. He looks like his hormones are through the roof. I'm surprised because I always thought Justine had a crush on Theo. And me, you know who I have a crush on? I'm not in the mood. What's wrong, you're tired of me? Want us to take a break? Come on. I was thinking, maybe we could let go of Oli's things, if you're ready. It's been six months. The shrink talked about a ritual for her death. It might help us to let her go. Makes sense, don't you think? C'mon, we're not gonna have a funeral for a miscarriage. You okay? Yeah. You know, your parents might not need our help to divorce. Is it since Oli that things have been tough between them? Everything'll be okay, Sardine. Everything is not always okay. Okay then. Wait. Thanks, you're a good lawyer. We're supposed to get ready for pizza night. I can't believe he's not here, it's weird. I need his address. He told us never to go to his place. I'll go alone if you're chicken. This is it. What are you doing here? You still okay for pizza night? You shouldn't be here. It was my rule. We wanted to make sure you were okay. I'm alright. I'll meet you in the park, now leave. I bet he didn't even get the pizza sponsorship. I just feel like he's gonna get us in trouble. Come on, Theo. I'll talk to him. We have a little problem. -What? -We can't get the pizza anymore. My dad's off work, so forget about it. I gotta go. -Guillaume, we'll figure it out. -You can do it on your own. -Your idea was shit anyways. -I knew you'd give up on us. Fuck you. You're just a quitter, like your dad. What did you say about my dad? Who do you think you are, Rocky? Hit me, Theo Balboa. You don't know anything, fucking jerk. My mom died last year. Come back, we didn't know. I gotta go take care of my dad. Kids shouldn't have to take care of their parents. -Everything'll be okay. -No, you were right. Everything is not always okay. Okay? Why'd you say that? You're not nice with Theo. He's just trying to help and you never give him a chance. Yeah, but he's the one who ruined everything. You've got that Rocky look now. We can still do the show together. Like we planned. You've got no choice now, you don't have a lawyer. Justine, we're not your stand-ins. Claudia! I just wanted to help. What you said was mean. TO GUILLAUME Can we talk? Please. I feel like things aren't like they used to be. And if that's how it is, I'm not interested. Okay, well, you're moving to your mom's soon, so we might as well say good-bye now. Good luck with the court and high school and all that. Iz there vezzie pizza at the pizza night? I dunno. Becauzze it's important to be a vezzetarian. Dear Guillaume the Chromosome, What happened yesterday was pretty awful. I didn't want things to end that way. Theo is a good guy. He didn't really want to hurt you. I understand if you don't want to be my lawyer. That's okay. P.S.: when you're ready, I have something to give you. Don't worry, it has nothing to do with your physical integrity. P.P.P.S.: I'm really sorry for breaking your rule. P.P.P.P.S.: I'm really sorry about your mom. I can't even imagine how hard that must be. P.P.P.P.P.S.: I have also lost someone. Even though it's not the same, I know how much it hurts. See you soon, Justine the Sardine. Clo! Claudia, I know you're there, answer me. I'm not answering because I don't wanna talk to you. -I'm sorry Clo, you were right. -I know I was right! You only need us 'cause you're in trouble. No, I'm doing it on my own. It's just that I think I was a jerk to Theo. Because I don't want him to go. Well, think twice next time. Good luck with your pizza. Wait. Please Clo, I'm sorry. I don't want to lose you guys, I love you too much. Yuck, what is this? It's disgusting. Dried cheese! Who made this? It's mushy. This won't take long, just answer my question. What's the best thing about your parents' split? We don't care. This is shameful! Please, I need your help. Your pizza is really gross. That's enough! Calm down and answer my question, please. We were told there'd be real pizza! Pizza fight! Stop! Don't throw pepperoni at me, I'm vezzetarian! Time out, game over! Everyone, I'll explain what's gonna happen. One by one, in front of the camera, tell me about the plus side of your parents' separation. But we want pizza. I don't wanna hear any bad things about divorce, okay? You, come here. What's the best thing about your parents' divorce? It was really hard at first but... Don't talk about your pain, just your joy. My parents never kissed or held hands but they do that now with their new lovers. I love having two rooms, two closets, two birthdays, two Christmases. I feel broken inside. Okay, cut! If you want a slice, only talk about the good stuff. Before, my parents argued a lot and now that they're separated, they just don't talk anymore. My dadz allerzic to dogz. I didn't understand a word. Sorry. My dad's allergic to dogs, so since I've been in joint custody, I have one with Mom. It's too sad. There's nothing good about it. It makes my parents sad. You, come here. You haven't answered yet. What do you like the most about your parents' divorce? My mom was not a very good cook... What's going on up there? One by one, in front of the camera, tell me about the plus side of your parents' separation. They're making a video too? Before, my parents argued a lot and now... I wanted to leave these in your mailbox. I didn't dare. But here. Yeah. I thought maybe it could help you with your dad. We've got some good stuff. ...but my step-mom is really good. Are your parents separated? My dad and I speak more now, it's cool. They were nice to say all that. Yeah, but they weren't saying it to their parents' faces. Not everyone's got balls like you. I miss my mom, but when I'm with her, I miss my dad. My mom has a new lover, but my dad... It wasn't nice of you to leave us. You had no right, it's not okay. You can't take that footage and show it to everybody. The truth is we chose you 'cause you're the worst. You have no friends. You can't say that. I did my job. You're always barfing, and now you'll look stupid in front of everyone. No, you'll look stupid. Your parents aren't separating, they're just sad. And you'll make them sadder. Wait up. Our court was supposed to end the fighting, not cause more. Well, I'm done. I'm not doing the show. You know that Justine didn't mean it. She's just afraid of what you've filmed. And you don't throw up all the time. Look, you haven't barfed in a long time. Can I tell you a secret? Even if Justine is my bestie, I think you're pretty great too. It's almost the end of the year, my dear students. Your prom is coming up. You must be proud of yourselves. You'll see, the friendships you build in school stay with you a long time. You have to nurture them. I wish you solidarity and unity. As a bonus, no homework tonight so you can finish preparing your sets. Tomorrow is showtime, so come and support your classmates and don't forget to tell your parents. We need help. -What? -Come. They're going to give up on the court. Come on! We hear you're giving up on the court skit for the show. Yes. I'd like my parents to see it. -Me too. -We all would've liked that. Pass the message on to Justine. ...tickets for Justine's show. I thought you put them on the fridge. I didn't. You don't have them? THEO: Still coming tomorrow? Whatever happens, I'll always be your friend. Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Have you changed your mind for tomorrow? It's not too late if you still want to do the show. You just want the grades. If you'd stayed after school, you would've seen how important the court skit is. A lot of people think you're amazing for doing this. If you do it, I'll talk with my dad. Do you really think I'm still in it for the grades? My parents'll freak. Sometimes you gotta be brave enough to say how you feel. Even if it hurts. Now, I'll pull a Theo. What? A Theo, going out the window. Two hours to showtime. Ernestine. I'm sorry about what I said. I brought my parents' robes for you and Guillaume. I mean, if you still want to do it. I even shortened the sleeves, so you'd look like a real lawyer. Thanks. In exchange, I won't show what I filmed in that little room. So, are we doing it? Because we were all thinking about flaking out. Come here, sulky. It'z cool that you're doing the zhow and it'z great to see you, Zustine. Okay then, it'z a go. What'd he say? And now, The Youth Court. Hello. Welcome all. Now, I'd like the lawyers to come forward. All rise for the Judge. You may be seated. The Youth Court is now in session. I call on the plaintiff, Justine Beaulieu. Justine Beaulieu, please. I now ask Martin and Julie Beaulieu to come forward. -No, no. -Aw, come on. Mr. and Mrs. Beaulieu, please. Thank you. DEFENDANTS This is great. Silence. I'm Ernestine, your lawyer. Hello. I now call Justine to the bench. Attorney Deschamps, you're up. Justine Beaulieu, what are you doing here today? I'm filing for divorce. Can you elaborate? It’s hard to say. This is it, Justine. It's your time. My parents fight all the time. I'd like them to divorce. Objection, Your Honour. Are all the other parents coming up here, or...? Silence! I'd like to hear from the plaintiff's friends. Theo and Claudia, please come to the bench. I'm not a witness! Divorce is not a good solution. For example, you, Theo. Your parents split because your dad cheated on your mom, and now you have to move to your mom's place and leave your friends behind forever, isn't that right? Well... Speak up, please. -My mom's watching. -Please. -Yeah. -Thank you. And you, Claudia? Don't you want to see your father more often? It's important for a girl to stay in touch with her father. Yes, but I think my mom is happy and I don't mind that she has a lot of boyfriends. They are both unhappy for the sake of their parents' happiness. Thank you, Your Honour. If there's someone unhappy here, it's my client. And it's a fundamental right for a child to feel good at home. It's not a kid's role to take care of their parents. I have here a recording that proves Justine's unhappiness. This is what she lives with every day. I'm sick of your shitty comments. -That's enough, okay? -We can't let them do this. C'mon, this is just a game. Really? A game? I've had enough of this. Okay, enough. First, this is totally illegal. This violates personal privacy rights. You have no warrant to use those recordings. What's a warrant? You could be prosecuted in a real court of law. Let's not exaggerate. And that's the end of The Youth Court. They went a little too far, but it'll be okay. A round of applause! Adults never listen, never. -We can't make a scene. -It's already a scene! Stop screaming! It's like you don't care. Why don't we ever talk about Oli? I lost her, now I'm losing my parents. Justine, my parents don't listen either. I don't wanna move away. I'm so sorry, sweetie. I had no idea it affected you this much. We should have talked about it, eh? Sorry Mom, I didn't mean to hurt you more. I'm the one who's sorry. I can't believe she's already going to her prom. Look how pretty she is. You're beautiful. Let's go. -You're alone, Chromosome? -Hey Sardine. I think someone else should sit here. I'm gonna take off. You don't have to. Anyway, I wanna go talk to Alicia and Lou. You're a cool one, Sardine. -Is it okay if I... -Of course. -It's not that you're not... -Go on. You don't have to sit here, the court's over. No, I feel like it. I wanted to give you this before you move. But I'm not leaving anymore. -Oh? Then you don't have to... -No, I want to. I LOVE YOU THEO! What? I dunno, it seems like your spark is back. In memory of Christian Picone
