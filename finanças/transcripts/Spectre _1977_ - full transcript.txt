SPECTRE I had come here to meet a man I vowed never to see again. He was vain, arrogant, selfish, but his brilliance was still irresistible. He was also dangerous, never to me, but this evening began for both of us a slide into horrors unimaginable, a descent into a corner of hell. I see. Yes, doctor. I'm ready for you. I thought for a minute your bell didn't work. What's that...? This way, doctor. Mr. Sebastian has been expecting you. Hello, William. Your tastes have changed, but unfortunately not your manners. You did send this telegram? I need you. Signed William Sebastian. Just three words: "I need you", and I come racing across the entire country. You know why? Because I know your ego. For you to say I need anyone, has to mean you're in desperate trouble. But it looks like you haven't done badly. I don't suppose any of this is paid for. No, of course not. - You just wanted it. - Neither of us has done very well apart. - Ever done badly. - Really? Well, do you know that your hospital's scheduled a hearing? On the 15th they discuss your problem. My problem? What problem? Do you talk about my taking a social drink now and then? And then there's all that business with the nurses. I can understand about the young ones, but an old crow like Hadley. Did you really had to propose to her? I did not propose! The woman assummed I proposed! How do you know all this? No, whatever, no. No no, I won't ask. You know, you haven't changed a bit. - Why? - Come with me to London. No. - Tonight. - No! Ham, this case is so complex, so bizarre, that it's literally unexplainable in normal sane rational terms, even to you. Come with me on blind faith. By the time it's done, we'll have answers in criminal psychology that will revolutionize the field. I'll find my own way out. - Ham. - No. Ham, that telegram was true. I need you. May I have a look at that? That's not a normal scar tissue. No, it's not. My heart was made to stop beating. Made to stop? My housekeeper whom you met, Lilith, brought me back. Saved my life. See the heart here, where it's deformed to stand it like a whole, as if something had shot through it.[xxxx] - Well, there's no foreign object there. - No, there's not. Because it isn't there. It's in a doll. Unfortunately I can't find the doll. I'll live for a few years, if I sit right here, no work, no physical exercise, no projects... no women. - That'll be our car at the airport. - You're in no condition to travel. Not without you holding me down on a tight leash. William, the hospital is justified in worrying about me. You need better attention than a compulsive drinker can give you. Condition is being corrected by my housekeeper. Miss Anitra Cyon. This is Mr. Sebastian. Miss Cyon. - How do you do. - How do you do. This is doctor Hamilton. Oh, I've heard of Dr. Hamilton. - And your work together. - Please sit down. Thank you. Your secretary said that you and I would be meeting in London, that you were sending the family jet for me tonight, I thought. I decided to come over on it, so that I could explain in person. Mr. Sebastian, I wish to cancel our agreement. There's no need for you to fly over to see my brother. Oh, I'll pay any expenses you've incurred, of course. You see, when I asked you to kill my brother, or rather to destroy what I thought he'd become... Ham, would you excuse us for a moment? Yes... of course. Please. Lovely primitive art. But it's only superstition. I don't know how I let myself believe any of it. I love my brother. I won't embarrass him any further. - You wrote that he welcomed my investigation. - He hoped that you'd ease my mind. Convinced me that the things I thought I saw were just figments of my imagination. - Now I know I've been wrong. - In your letters you described incidents - that were clearly paranormal. - No, I described things I only thought I saw. - I can explain everything now. - I've corresponded with doctor Qualus about you. You know that. He was interested in Cyon House and the entire family long before you first wrote to me. Yes, my brother is different. Well, he's had to be strong. Mitri and I we were children when our parents died. Geoffrey had to take care of us. Everything he's built he shared equally with us. Tell me. I'd rather not sit. I'm so ashamed. I don't think all this keep you all with us.[xxxx] I was deceiving myself. I was fascinated by you. I wanted to meet you. I sound like a schoolgirl. No. A drink, doctor? - Yes. - While you wait, sir? Yes. A spiked drink? Is that your so-called cure? But you've already been cured doctor. I've put a spell on you. Well, here is your spell. Doctor Hamilton is... I can't leave him out there. Send him away, please. There's a book I want him to read. I'll find it and.... get rid of him. What's happening? Sebastian! Open it! Sebastian! Open the door! Sebastian! William! What are you doing in there? Come on and open it! Where is she? What is this? That's The Apocryphal Book of Tobit. Where is that woman? Where is she? She was never here. - What's happened? - What we saw was a succubus. Don't be ridiculous. The woman was here. Where is she? An imp, or minor demon takes the form of a provocative woman to tempt men through lust. Seduce them. - What's all of this junk in here? - Corrupt them. Wiliam, what have you done to yourself? What's happened to you? You know, William... I love you like a brother but have always considered your brilliance just a razor's edge between sanity and madness. If I find out you've harmed anyone... You'll see that I'm put away. Yes. Agreed. - Mr. Sebastian? - Yes. How do you do. I'm Mitri Cyon. Pilot jet's plane, if that doesn't bother you. Oh, it doesn't bother me at all. Mr. Cyon, this is Dr. Hamilton. He's got to be going with us. - How do you do. - How do you do. You brought your sister with you, of course. Ani? No, doctor. Why? Do you know my sister? I thought I met her last night. It'd be extremely difficult. I left her at home in England. Somebody must have been putting you on, Ham. - Gentlemen. - Sure. Cyon jet, come traffic control. Maintain 30.000. Cyon jet holding at 30.000. Thank you. Out. Soft drinks for us, gentlemen? Or can I fix to you something a little more interesting? No, thank you. Someone put something in my drink. - That's not true. - My stomach is slightly upset. Right. The role of the succubus is carnal temptation. Why was it sent? To kill me? William, there is no such thing as a succubus. Or to test me. Find out how determined I was to come to Cyon House. Thank you, London radio. Cyon jet out. Your sister sounded puzzled by that call. Puzzled myself. Something that doctor said. About Ani... I just phoned her on the radio-telephone and she is at home, Cyon House. Someone must putting you on. The odd thing is she had facial structure very similar as yours. Quite lovely, quite physical, quite shapely. No, no, that's the way off. She is rather bony old maidish. Peter, yes. What is it? What do you mean? It's nothing on the instruments. It must be something wrong with the electrical system. Interesting. First, carnal temptation, now, threat of death. Are you saying someone's doing this purposely? - No, not someone. - This is a malfunctioning... human-built machine. Sorry if it's a little dark right there, gentlemen. We were using battery power for cabin matching. Our winglights have gone too. Suppose I prove to you that supernatural exists. Seatbelts please, gentlemen. My friend, we've spent our entire adult life studying the criminal mind, haven't we? The abnormal, the deviant. Remember how we puzzled with Manson case? Speck's killing the eight nurses. Crime after crime with no apparent rational cause. Why don't you fasten your seatbelt? After you left... I kept asking myself there wasn't something else? Some other factor that we hadn't considered. What's happening? Gentlemen, please don't be too upset. Though we've lost power on our port engine we still have full starboard power. North Atlantic Four, this is Cyon Jet, losing power and descending. Do you read? Ham, listen to me, I've seen these things myself. I made an agreement with such a force once in the Aleutian Islands. Half-believing, testing it. When it actually appeared to me, the acts expected of me were unspeakably vile. [xxxx] I was revolted and I was frightened. I went back on the agreement and this was done to me. May Day, May Day! Come in Shannon. The radio is stopping on transmiting. [xxxx] What's happening? Everything reads normal. We've lost all power! Try boost us again. You don't deny that many the world's oldest legends had been proved to have basis in fact. I would admit that some old medical legends have proven to have some sense behind them. Why do the world's races hold almost identical believes in these things? Scientists would say the only logical explanation. Is that they are reporting things that they have actually seen. Glimpses the worlds that overlap ours. If I can see something, or at least see some evidence of it...? People do make contact from time to time. These things have the ability to contact us. We'd even give them names: Mammon, Beelzebub, Asmodeus, Leviathan, Astaroth, What in the devil...? Yes. Exactly. We're back to full power now, gentlemen. We'll be landing very soon. I'm sorry you have to go through all this. Just because it happens to be directed at me. Are you saying because it's failed to frighten you? It's given up... Perhaps merely a reminder of how sweet a full life would be if were offered to me. If it were offered. That's luck that the shakes waited till now. - Nevermind, we got here. - Magnificent job. Ah, Syd! This is my brother's chauffeur. Sydna, would you take these gentlemen onto Cyon House? I'm afraid I shall have to stay behind looking to the trouble we had with the engines. Excuse me. Thank you. Here you are, sir. She is extraordinarily sensual. I doubt that she's another succubus, if that's what you mean. - Yes, sir? - Yes, there's a stop I'd like to make first. - Merlin's Mews Nr 3. - Yes, sir. Interesting. She was already headed in that direction. It seems to be private. I guess you'll have to wait here. Of course, sir. Doctor Qualus! It's Qualus. This is Qualus'es library. - Whoever killed him was after something. - William! You knew this man. He's been torn to pieces. Look at the design. What is it? It's a pentacle. He almost got to the center. He's been clawed to death. It's his journal. It's Qualus journal. Here, hold this. Get in the center. Go back! Get out that door! Get out that door! You there! What are you doing here? It's all right, Constable. I know these gentlemen. Inspector Cabell. It's good to see you again. You remember doctor Hamilton? - I'd heard that you two had broken up. - No, no. Thick as thieves! What brought all of you here so soon? You're the same twosome alright. You jump the scene before me and then you have the gall to question me as to why I'm here. A neighbour heard screams and saw the blaze of fire. We flew in an hour ago. - I had an appointment with Dr Qualus. - It's all right to coming now, sir. They?ll have doused it in a moment. Right. Welcome to London. I'll need a statement from you in any case. It's called a pentacle. From the position of the body when we came in he was trying to get into it when he died. And your interest in Qualus? Certainly not this occult nonsense he dabbled in, eh? We've had our disputes, but I still rank you as one of the world's leading criminologists. One of...? Can you imagine that? Sydna, will you take the luggage along to Cyon House? The Inspector insisted that he will... bring us. You're sure you saw nothing? We saw neither man nor animal. Has any theory been formed about the killer? Obviously a madman. Makes himself up to frighten his victims before he kills them. Did the victims have anything to do with Sir Geoffrey Cyon, like business rivals? My answer is off the record, of course. In fact, there were some such connections. You know this Qualus killing doesn't fit that pattern at all. - Why not? - Well, he was far from wealthy, and, as for being influential, quite the opposite. Most of London now considers him as an old fraud. Claimed he could work spells and such, if you can believe that. Ridiculous. I must put an official question to you, Sebastian. Do you have a reason to believe that Sir Geoffrey Cyon is behind any of these killings? I have no reason to believe that Sir Geoffrey Cyon is behind any of these killings. No. You seem relieved. Sir Geoffrey is quite close to several members of the Cabinet, isn't he? This is England. No one is above the law. What was it? Some kind of a castle? It was called Kentworth Abbey. He spent millions refurbishing it. I'm told it?s no longer very abbeyish inside. Inspector, we'll be in touch. William, we're now telling lies to our police friends? I said we saw neither man nor animal, which is true. And I don't believe Sir Geoffrey Cyon, the man, is responsible for any killings. Easy now, easy. Easy... we'll get you right into bed. It's like... s... something being... twisted... A physical movement. It's gone. A welcome. - The maid will take your coats, gentlemen. - Thank you. Welcome to Cyon House. I'll tell Sir Geoffrey you're here. We're here to meet Miss Anitra Cyon. We're her guests. Sir Geoffrey is Master here, sir. - It's very beautiful. - Yes. Of course not. Of course not. What was in it? Me. Sir Geoffrey will see you in a moment, sir. Thank you very much for coming over. I think it'd be the most satisfactory meeting. - Your cap, General. - Thank you. Good bye. Your sheath is outside. Then you'd like me due to make your journey... We can reading this satisfactory. Is there anything I can get you? A... slight accident, sir. Sir Geoffrey, this is William Sebastian. I'm doctor Hamilton. I prefer to be addressed by my family name. - Cyon. - Cyon, then. May we see your sister? Oh yes. Ani invited you, but I should have to pay you for your services. What's your price? I'd like your Boucher. "The Venus Reclining". We appreciate a sense of humor here, gentlemen. This painting cost me over 200,000 pounds. 200,270 to be exact. Don't be ridiculous. He'll take 150,000 in cash, less a damage cabinet, of course. Sebastian, if you can convince my sister, prove that her fears are justified, this painting is yours. Fail... you receive nothing. Convincing proof of what? Mr. Sebastian and I understand the terms. Perhaps so, but I like to hear the terms of that agreement stated precisely. Dr. Hamilton speaks for me in our negotiations. His business judgment is far superior to mine. The cash then. And since your sister began the negotiations with mister Sebastian, I think she should be a party to any agreement. It is fortunate, doctor, but my sister isn't right about me. You'll meet Ani now. I've had diner held for your arrival. Right. A carved ivory coffin-box. I don't recall owning such an object. Mitri. I'm sorry I'm late Geoff, but had a little trouble with the engines tonight. But we couldn't find anything wrong with them. I do hope it wasn't too upsetting. I found it extremely illuminating. Anitra. Mr. William Sebastian, Dr. Hamilton, my sister Anitra. Welcome to Cyon House, Mr. Sebastian. Good evening. - Dr. Hamilton. - How do you do. Their price is high, Ani. I hope you get our money's worth. Do you have a younger sister? Perhaps a close relative in the United States? Neither, Doctor. Problems, Doctor? No, no... none at all. Well, Annie, shall we have it all out into the open? The shrewd Doctor wants his employment terms spelled out. As you wish. Mr. Sebastian must prove that there is some evil here and that I am under its influence. Or convince you that it is merely my lifestyle that offends your puritanical sensibilities. What about it, my girl? Am I one of the Devil's boys? Oh, much, much worse, sir. See, gentlemen, I made no apologies for living openly, what most men do in secret. Shall we drink to Mr. Sebastian success? Just a moment, please. Glass splinters. - If you drank that... - Which of you decanted the wine? It's the old crystal, Ma'am. That's true. It's become brittle with age. - Something wrong with your drink too, doctor? - No, no, I... - don't drink much these days. - In that case let me have yours, Ham. If you?ll all permit me to make a toast. Condenea et Attidues, et altra deum, santus deum exoristom infinitum. Can you explain this, Mr. Sebastian? I'm sure there's a perfectly rational explanation. We're having some trouble with the main gate, sir. The sonic control seems jammed. Your front gate is controlled by high frequency sonic waves. Which caused the old and brittle glass to shattered simply, huh? Your glass isn't shattered. Shall we go on with dinner? Thank you. I'll pour. Are you sure, Madam? That'll be all. I'm very grateful you're here. - Did you believe my letters? - I did, but not all their conclusions. Do you believe my brother is possessed? That may be a great deal more complex. I need time. Doctor, you had some question about a younger relative in America. Yes. - Did you see me there? - Yes, at least a version of you. - Was I pretty, a desirable? - Yes. So I thought! You saw someone quite different from myself. I find the present version quite attractive. It's a charming compliment. I don't have many compliments lately. Is there anything else you want, Madam? Get out! Geoff's mates make other women rough and unnoticeable. - Are you jealous of them? - Sebastian. No, no, that's a fair question. Did I write to you out of jealousy? I wouldn't want to hurt my brother just because I disapprove of his lifestyle. Not certain that I do totally disapprove. As Geoffrey makes perfectly clear, I'm rather spinsterish. I wish I were not. I think I envy that version you saw of me. I do envy some things about the young women employed here. I think they shoud envy you. - There's nothing lovelier than honesty. - It's much more likely to frighten men away, doctor. But I love my brothers very much. But everything that's happening here... Mitri has been corrupted. And Geoffrey may already be lost. I hope not. I beg you, save what you can of them. Destroy whatever it is, that doing this. Do you understand of what you're asking me may be beyond my abilities? Yes, but if you can... And if you had to kill all of us in Cyon House, well you will do? If you'll excuse us. He needs rest. Mitri, will you see them up? I'll say goodnight. - Brandy before bed, gentlemen? - It's bed what we need most. I... barely touched it. I'm very sorry, doctor. I can't understand it at all. It's rotten away. But this is new. We changed the whole interior, what, at least 3 years ago? - Entire structure? - Yes. Started to with the new wine cellars for Geoff, and he just went on rebuilding. - Really, I'm terribly sorry, Doctor. - That's quite allright. And I... I hope you don't mind waterbeds, Doctor. No. That's all we had adjoining Mr. Sebastian's room. Well, be happy you have this room. Mine's like a bordello. On the bed, friend. What do you make of Anitra? Well, regardless what she's written you, she seems normal enough. In fact, interesting. She has almost everything her... other version had. Careful. Sounds like you're close to admitting you did see a succubus. That's what you said at dinner. "Everything has a logical explanation". High frequency sound, brittle crystal... And the toast that was an old curse against demons. One of them couldn't drink to it. Can you explain why all their glasses shattered? Well, it could scarcely give itself away either by refusing the drink or shuttering just its own glass. It? Whatever it is, could be any one of the three of them. Old Coptic script. Qualus knew someone might be after the information. He's used it like a shorthand. Just a light tranquilizer. First entry is dated just over three years ago. "Have just returned from Druid's Firepit where Cyon House excavations have brought up artifacts which disturbed me greatly." This one, few months later. "I can feel a marked change in Cyon. What has he found here?" Now listen to this one. "My greatest fears are realized. A is free. Bound and helpless for over two thousand years? But he has been freed. I am desperate to warn Cyon but he will not listen. Has A taken him already?" A? "I dare not write his true name, but this is his mark." In the top hierarchy of demons are Beelzebub, Belial, Leviathan, and the name that Qualus feared to write: Asmodeus, Prince of Lechery, Lord of Corruption. Gust of wind down the chimney? I do not believe it this nonsense. Asmodeus. You see? Coincidence. A gust of wind. No, it responded to me. Directly. What...? What are you doing here? What an awful thing to say. - You haven't enjoyed my company? - I've been asleep all night. Well, you can?t use that excuse now, can you? You choose. - Are you a succubus? - No. But it has a nice sound to it. Since you?re that naughty... Did you ring, sir? We will have such lovely evenings. You'll find so many ways to be happy. Does Daddy like a drinkey? I thought you told her never to play at the bar. She needs a lesson, Daddy. I'm so sorry. Am I interrupting? No, no, they're just leaving. No, as a matter of fact these ladies just come here. I'm hardly awake... Perhaps another time, ladies. Move! - I've been awake two minutes at most... - Two minutes and accomplished all that? That's amazing! You might have found it more entertaining than the staircase, Ham, but as just is dangerous. That. That's what woke me. Get some cllothes there. It's a Druid Ring. But why would they call this one Firepit? Those sounds... Women? Animals? Out for a stroll, gentlemen? We heard noises from that circle. -Oh? Let's have a look. The wind makes odd noises around here at times. - Plus it have been the hounds. - No, I'm positive. - I had no idea we were trespassing. - Not at all. But I wouldn't come out here again in the future, gentlemen. These hounds could be dangerous. This way gentlemen, please. Financiers? Not the kind that simply own things. They control world markets. You saved yourself acclaim. Let me guess. The Inspector's learned that Qualus kept the journal. He'll be tempted to arrest you, William. They treat evidence very seriously here. No, once he finds what's in this journal, he'll wish we'd kept it. - We won't be more than half an hour. - I'll be waiting, sir. Ah, Sebastian, dr. Hamilton. So much for the policeman's life. I imagine you've learned by now that Qualus kept the journal. Get yourself cleaned up. - I'll be out shortly. - Yes, sir. Removing evidence from the scene of a crime, Mr. Sebastian... I saved you days of red tape, and a very expensive translation. Do you want our help in this or not? I hope this doesn't include some foolishness about Sir Geoffrey. Yes. I thought the home office might give you a call on that one. As you said, this is England and no man is above the law. It's just that some men are above being annoyed, unless you have a mountain of evidence against them. Have you decipher this writing, Sebastian? Principally it's a record of Qualus' concern over certain activities at Druid's Firepit. Near Cyon House. There's a say there's something going on at Cyon House? That depends whether one believes in demons and all that nonsense. What kind of demons does it describe? Just one, a top hierarchy sort, the Prince of Lechery. Does that jolly chap have a name? Asmodeus. When he corrupted humans, usually through lust, these corrupt people became capable of changing their physical shape during certain black rituals. It was suppose to them some kind of sexual release involved in the metamorphosis itself. Are you saying Cyon imagines himself possessed? Well, according to legend Asmodeus does not possess. He takes the form, the image of someone, some human who's died, whose body's never been found. Are you implying Cyon as our madman? He costumes himself, goes out and kills? At the time of the first murder Cyon was at the U.N. Committee conference in Paris. - Murder number two he was in Angola. - Good. Then we agree there is no evidence Cyon could have done it. So there's no reason I should bother him. No evidence? What do you think that journal is I just given you? - Yes. - Yes. You'll find my translation in the back pages. Do you know there are no less than five separate sources, all of them in ancient Coptic, that made reference to Asmodeus having establish quite a foothold in these islands during the Sixth Century B.C. But the rites, the ceremonies of his followers, disciples, if you will, became so bloody, so obscene that the Druids and the other priesthoods who would always been at odds with one another, finally banded together against him. They tricked him eventually, sealed him up, supposedly forever, in a secret place. Qualus believed the secret place was Druid's Firepit, until three years ago, when the demon was freed. Accidentally, of course, when Cyon was excavating new cellars. Very interesting. And now, I think I'll muddle along without any further help. Thank you, Ham. - You're becoming a bit of a believer. - I'm only trying to keep an open mind. C Flat, Treble Clef. - More like that. - Yes, I'd say more like that. One of yours? How did you guess? It's beautiful. Thank you. It's amazing. What are you doing flying an airplane? It's Geoff's idea. Oh, that?s not entirely fair. I had gone through my R.A.F. training and why pay another pilot when is already one in the family? You help run the family business? No. no, no. Geoff's the financial wizard. He's already increased our holdings a dozen times and he's only just begun. Still you and your sister each one third of Cyon family interests. Yes, but with me and Geoff voting together, or rather me backing him, I'm afraid that Ani's vote doesn't really count for much. I think that that is very much part of her annoyance with things here. That's incredible what Geoff's done in the last few years. Well, the possibilities are staggering if he continues like this. It's amazing: whatever he wants he seems to get. Suddenly, he has developed a kind of a personal magnetism. You know, an ability to understand other people's... weaknesses. I was only bragging about it, wasn't I? Mr. Sebastian's job here is to quiet the superstitious fears of our beloved sister. - Come on, Geoffrey. - That and that only. Or would you prefer to see her committed? Oh no. Look, I?ll admit Anitra has some strange ideas... She's going insane, you young idiot. Like you, she has a rather modest intellect. Have you begun wondering if I'm possessed, dear brother? I have wondered if it's Anitra who's going mad. Excuse me, Mr. Sebastian. And what is your opinion of me, Mr. Sebastian? I am... impressed. And I see unusual qualities in you. Just as you've checked upon me I've accumulated information on you. Your intelligence quotient, the phenomenal memory and an ego which suggests a certain ruthlessness. I'd find that valuable in our society. Would you? I promise you, you will never regret joining me. Are you about to invite him into your club? - That is enough, Ani. - No, there is much more. Anitra! I wrote you about his obscene hellfire club, Mr. Sebastian. - I warn you, if you cannot... - It's a very select membership. It's Mitri. There's something in Mitri's room! The ambulance is on it's way, sir. Well, you can cancel it, officer. Dr. Hamilton is handling it nicely. In fact expertly. Must be a comfort to have him close. - Any witnesses? - One of the hounds. Gored and thrown over there. Here's a gash across his interior chest. The rip in his arm is very deep and of course he's badly bruised. He was lucky to have a doctor at home. - Can I have a word with him? - Yes. Mr. Cyon, can you describe your assailant? I didn't see anything. Just stepped in and something stroke me from behind. Hard... I remember calling for help. Mitri, was it a man? Was it an animal thing? It is important that we know. I've asked him, he doesn't remember. I think he should sleep now. The disciples of Asmodeus - ...are capable of great physical change. - Oh, Sebastian, please. The change in each individual depends upon the person's inner lusts, vices, animalistic tendencies. And these people change back and forth, having a jolly time, eh? Asmodeus pays them very richly for their devotion. Each time they become human again they grow stronger physically, sexually, their worldly affairs prosper. Sebastian, that's quite enough for me. I can give you several reference books. - Qualus' journal doesn't really cover it all. - I have your expertise, Sebastian. Would you at least leave a constable on duty outside? - If his attacker may return. - Very well. Keep me informed of Mitri's condition, Doctor. With a constable on the ground, Cyon will have to pen up his dogs. We can have a closer look at those ruins. What about that attack on Mitri? Puzzles me. We're being manipulated. Maybe he wants us at the ruins now. He knows we're coming. We got to protect ourselves the best we can. Symbols involve dimensions that are as real to them as walls or doors are to you and me. - Oh, this... It looks priceless. - Very nearly. Why must you always on the best of everything, William? You could buy a cross in any gift shop. It should possess extraordinary power. It was worn and blessed by saintly men for over 9 centuries. If you have a religious object of yours, I suggest you carry it. Well, this, plus my nickname Ham, should shake-up any demon. It's good to be together again. Did I say that? Dozens of times. Back stairway, I think. Watch it! Come on. It's allright. It's balanced to close by itself. What's that smell? Burning tar? From what? England's not volcanic. More likely pitch beds underground. Druid's Firepit. The flames must once have been up at the ground. Pretty Druid. Fascinating. The age of this place... Hold that. Yes, one of a maid's dresses. Careful, it can all come down. It's obscene. You mean it seems obscene. It's no symbology I understand. Here, put your light on this. It's impossible for something to feel evil to the touch. Am I imagining this? Some sort of air-conditioning system? Could be the geology itself. It's unstable here. Look out! Very nearly to Late Doctor Hamilton. Well, I didn't have the expensive symbol. We're directly under Cyon House here. He broke into the caverns up there. A wine cellars must be there. Behind the door. It must have been one of the workmen. This is it. A secret place. His own Black Cathedral. Whatever smash these doors open... ...was the thing that Geoffrey Cyon set free. Ham... Ham, look over on that side. Find the other half of the seal. No, nothing. These doors must weigh tons. William, can you feel evil like a physical force? Hold this, carefully. It's gold. Solid gold. Hold there. When we find the other half, if we find it, the power of the two halfs joined together should be incredible. Purified by prayer to a hundred forgotten gods. Look at it. Their names are inscribed on it. Their prayers. Cyon found the doors closed. Seal was intact. When he broke it... And the thing was free... after 25 centuries. The sacrificial altar. Dried blood. - Here. - Slowly, slowly. She's not even aware we're here. She doesn't appear to have any injuries. We'll get her down and I'll examine her. Leave her alone. It's too much much at stake. William! Ham. I was right. The power of even half the seal is holding it back. A disciple. - It wasn't human. - It was. It's just the same... thing... twisted. Come on out! Come on! Wait! Asmodeus will control more and more political and material power. I can't let you go to London. I mean it. Then you have to go. I need a saw, jeweler's saw and a file. Go to a gunsmith. Find one the best. Get from him everything we need to cut a piece of this, melt it, pour it into a bullet mold to fit this barrel. A golden bullet? From the seal that imprisoned Asmodeus. Yet... it won't destroy him, but it'll slow him down. And I need holy water from a baptism. And I need communion wine. Has to be blessed - and blessed by a Bishop. - I'm not a witch from Macbeth. Then don't do it. Alright. I'll try if you rest. OK. At least the bullet will stop any of Asmodeus' creature-things. If Cyon is Asmodeus... then what human is his priest? That'll be the most dangerous of the disciples. The legends have it that he's... he takes... the form of a great cat of some sort. - Thank you. Keep the change. - Thank you, sir. Doctor Hamilton. Cyon reported his sister missing this afternoon. I'd say he doesn't seem too concerned. He states that she's been emotionally unstable. I don't believe Cyon's story. Doctor Hamilton, on your word as a physician, do you think that could be something to... to the things in that Qualus journal? - Yes, I do. - Then I need facts. Can you give me anything to go on? I can. There were workmen here three years ago excavating the cellar. It's my guess they all died. That's precisely the kind of thing I need. I'll be back with a court order. Cyon, any news of Anitra? - Geoff's giving a proper party tonight. - Mitri, your sister was missing. If anybody's taken Ani, then he's the one in trouble. She could be in danger. Ah, don't you realize that Ani is even stronger than Geoff? She's always saying that one day someone is going to realize that she's the real tiger in the house. I wonder why Cyon reported her missing. To throw the police off? Perhaps because he intends the disappearance to be problem. It could be something else. Mitri just mentioned to me, that she often refers to herself as the real tiger in the house. What? You said that priest disciple has a cat form. A tiger? She was the one who brought us here. No, no. Don't exert yourself. Let me... Here. It's Mitri. The body is mummified. It's not Cyon. It was never Cyon. It's Mitri. Asmodeus is Mitri. He's about to broke the seal. Stand in here, the doors burst open... thus have crushed him. Asmodeus... Asmodeus... No, keep it separate. If it's joined together now, they fulfill the power in it. I?ll need it fast when I ask for it. Anitra. Asmodeus! Let her call to him! God! Please, God! Help me! Attend thee, dear brother! Help me! Help! Dear brother, I will be served fully! Lord Admodeus, I have served you well. I will be served fully! Fully! Become now my priest, my favored one. Incredible. And fascinating. His own sister. Asmodeus wants his soul. No! Leave her alone! It's the same dilemma I faced. Cyon wants to keep free will. He's going back on his agreement. I will give true with her death, but her death only, Lord. Kill! Don't! I cannot, Lord! Forgive me. I cannot. Asmodeus. Die, bastard! Sebastian. Come forth, Sebastian. That's why I was brought. He knew Cyon would fail. Sebastian I call thee! Sebastian! Sebastian! Inspector Cabell. It is Cabell. I greet thee, Lord Asmodeus. Thy deepest needs, Sebastian. Only thou and I know them. William, it's you. A gift. A gift of life. And now, Sebastian, be though my priest, a favored one. My Lord... William. I will obey. Sebastian! Get fight him! You are as strong as I am! And I withstood him! Kiss! Sebastian, you promised... Sebastian. Kill us all. Get fight him! No one is above the law! A bargain struck is a bargain made. A bargain made! That's the law, that's the law! I reject thee, vile spirit! Depart! I give thee Hell! Now, the other seal! Spectre, flee! [xxxx] I give thee hell fire! Burn! Burn! Burn! That's the law! Sebastian! Take her! Take her! Since you were thinking of hot tea, Doctor... You read my mind. And one thought I see there pleases me greatly. Asmodeus was not destroyed. We'll see him again. - Not a pleasant thought. - You'll do better next time. Next time? You know, you stood down there actually considering Asmodeus' offer. Miss Anitra Cyon, gentlemen. Miss Cyon, what a delightful surprise. - Doctor Hamilton. - You really are... extraordinary, isn't it? I'm over here on family business and I wanted to bring you an additional thank you present. The one you admired was burnt with a house, of course, but... No, it's marvelous. It's even better. Excuse me just for a moment. That's a bit unfair. I should have brought you a gift as well. Really unnecessary. I... Yes? I suppose we could leave William to examine his prize. It's the apocryphal Book of Tobit, Ham. Fourth shelf right at the desk. It is Miss Cyon. Relaxed and rested now. Well, you and I know that, but Ham doesn't. It should be an interesting session in there. subtitles by Orion1 please amend [xxxx]
