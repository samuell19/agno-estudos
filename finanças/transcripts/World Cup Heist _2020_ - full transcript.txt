I want my money Rick - we gonna resort to blackmail Amanda - blackmailing me Rick - what did I ever see in you what did I see in you clearly so what is it that you really want me to say how dare you call me a gold digger you're forgetting that I actually loved you do you forget about that it was not about money or shopping or the materialistic stuff or any of that I actually loved you you took me from here to all the way down here I'm not happy about that of course not I guess it must have been like giving you a winning lotto ticket and taking it back what do you think it is like giving someone hungry food then taking it away no I'm not going back to my old life you taught me this life I want back in Amanda - simple as that Rick - OK fine OK I'm going to give you $100,000 I have not got $300,000 if I had I would give you it I'm such a generous guy I've given you so much I'm such a lovely guy like that I'm going to get Noah to wire it to your account in Florida account you jump on the next flight I will cover the cost you do that and it will be in your account first thing tomorrow morning Rick -

you got your guy on the CCTV Rick - yeah I got him yeah it is red hot but it is going to work fine don't worry I'm not confident you're not confident why Chloe - I just got a bad feeling Rick - we got everything covered I got hacker here and this area we got totally covered right Damien - if I get the hacker to put a decoy there so nobody will focus where we are leaving from will that help you are you happy if we move Jane from that corner to West Broadway yeah I think Jane will be great yeah are you sure that is going to be OK with you Jane yeah all good everything is good with me everything is good to go you know what to do if it gets on top and the numbers to all and codes I do yeah all sorted OK as long as you're comfortable with that you do not seem sure what is it be honest you're the one with the gun you should be the most confident here well you done the move so not much more I can do but I'm still not confident be confident and be confident in every job I have ever done Chloe - I'm taking the gun Paul - like I said that's on your call every single job I have ever done every single heist look at my track record not one of my heist team have ever been caught I got a woman down in Brazil she don't even need plastic surgery she is sailing plain high right Jane you wanna come have a look we are moving you down to West Broadway down the bottom corner you are he number one look out you know the codes you know the numbers you know how to let everyone know what's going on we got Frankie she is going to tell us how she will get us in to the vault right I will turn these off you have got 60 seconds to get in before I put the lights back on I will switch them off again so it looks like a power cut and you got 60 seconds to get back out before you get caught Frankie -
