We can't get a word out of him. We're lucky he told us your name. Can l talk to him? Are you sure you don't know why he did it? l already told you l don't. You don't take 60 sleeping pills for nothing. Maybe now you'll tell me what made you do this. THE CONSEQUENCE Here's the new guy. Well, well ... Our child molester from Gnomenau. Hey, Fritz ... the new guy's here. Okay. Come on. What did he do? Feel up little girls? Hell, no. Little boys. How old was he? Who? The boy you ... Fifteen. And that's why you're being punished, not because you're a homosexual. Oh? l would only have gotten two and a half years if it had been a girl. l don't know. l haven't looked into the case. You've already spent a third of your term awaiting trial. The rest won't seem so bad, not if you've got the right attitude. You really belong in a woman's penitentiary, you know. l've heard that one before. All right, Kurath, listen. lf your conduct is good, we can consider releasing you ahead of time. You're not just anybody. We get a lot of homosexuals here, but an actor? That's a new twist. What do you want? l heard you were an actor. So what? l've got something for you. A play. The real nitty-gritty. l wrote it myself. So, what's it to me? We could put it on here. lt'd be really sensational. What, here in jail? You've got to be kidding. The title of it is "Hopeless." A tragedy. Dynamite, l tell you. What is this? Let's have a look. lt ain't porno, Mr. Manzoni, just a theater play. We're going to put it on-- me and Kurath here. A little less sentimental, Lem. You're supposed to be a woman. Yes, you're too dramatic. Try to be a little more natural. Wait until you get out, then you'll see what people are really like! Quiet, goddam it! You can depend on me, Mr. Fisher. l promise you. Mrs. Stucky is very serious about this, sir. She came here to prison to propose marriage to you. Can we have that last line again, Pastor? ls your son enjoying being in the play? He is but l'm not. lt'll keep him out of trouble. l don't know if l like him being around these cons. Believe me, Mr. Fisher. lt was love at first sight. Wasn't it, Pastor? Yes, Apostle Paul speaks of three virtues: faith, hope and charity. Quiet. He's coming. Father. Father! My boy. My son. l can't take any more, Dad. Today at school my teacher asked me why l'm so bad in math. And, what did you say? l said it's because-- l said it's because ... my father is in prison ... and because my mother left home and didn't come back. And then they all started staring at me and said, "ls it really true that your father's in jail? We never would have thought it." Father ... don't leave me all alone. No, my boy. We'll stay together now. Don't worry. Yeah, just keep on looking at me, Mrs. Stucky. l'm one of those guys that always ends up behind bars again, because there's never a chance for us on the outside. l'm a rotten, goddamn failure, and l'm going to tell you why. lt's because l'm scared of the future, and because there is not future for us on the outside. See ya! Hey, kid! Yes? - l've got to talk to you. - What about? You've got to watch out for this Kurath guy. Why? He's a queer. He gets his kicks from feeling up little boys. Hey, kid, wait! This isn't a jail. lt's a goddam circus! Yep. Hey, Thomas. Hey. You've started smoking already? A little. You're still a kid. Like hell, l am. Are you really a queer? Who said that? l just heard it. Hey, Lem, wait a minute. -The picture goes on the other side. -Why didn't you say so sooner? They've been talking about you at home. My dad doesn't like you. He hardly knows me. He hates queers. And you're sitting up here with me anyway? Okay, time to knock off! lt's quitting time. So long, Thomas. See ya. Come on, finish up. if you're late one more time, l write a report. Go ahead, write. "Dear Martin, when you look out the window of your cell, you can see the guards' houses. l live across from the gate. My room is upstairs. You can probably see it from your window. Forget where you are. l'd like to be there with you. Thomas. " Father! Father. He's dead. Good night. Good night, Kurath. What's kept you? Are you out of your mind? Why would l be? lf they catch us, we've had it. l wanted to be alone with you. Thomas, you're crazy. This is not good. This is not good at all. But it's all over-- lt's all over, with the play, l mean. This is our last chance to see each other. You won't be able to get out. You'll have to stay all night. That's what l want. What will your parents say when you come home? They won't notice. My father always comes home drunk. My mother takes sleeping pills every night. Weren't they at the play? They're not interested. - lt's nice here. - What? Really. lt's nice. l mean it. lt's nice here. l thought a cell would look different. l wouldn't mind living here. You wouldn't, huh? With you, of course. Are you hungry? And how! Have a seat. l only have one cup. That's okay. - Cheers. - Cheers. When school's out this spring l'll have to find a job. Doing what? l don't know. l'd rather go to college and study law ... or veterinary school. But my father doesn't want me to. You know him. He thinks differently than l do. Come. l think it's really rotten of them to lock you up like this ... for making love to a boy. What are you going to do? You can't change it. lf you like each other, what does it matter if it's a boy or a girl? That's what l think too. But the judges think otherwise. Did you like your boyfriend a lot? Yes. Are you still in touch with him? No. Why not? He has a girlfriend now. When my father finds out about me, he'll kill me. Why? What do you mean? lt's just that l can't get you out of my mind. You shouldn't have stayed here. Why shouldn't l have stayed here? Martin, why shouldn't l have stayed here? Was it your first time? Your beard is scratchy. Come on, tell me. l slept with a boy on a camping trip once. The pastor caught us ... and we had to do the dishes for the whole camp for a week. You've never had a boyfriend? No. What, Kurath? Up already? l'm an early riser just like you. Did you hear that? Your father. When l go to work, wait five minutes and then take off. l'll say l got locked in the chapel last night. Martin. l want to stay with you. l am very fond of you. l can't expect you to wait for me. lt would be asking too much. Don't say that. l've got some money saved up, over 1 ,000 francs. l can work in the paper factory every day after school. When you get out in January l'll have enough to rent an apartment. We could go to another country where nobody knows us. l'm going to wait for you. You're the only person l have. Kurath, wait a second. l've got something for you. - Thanks. - You're welcome. "Dear Martin, ever since we've been apart l've realized how much l love you and how badly l need you. lsn't it funny how one person can completely change another's life? Every day l think about what's going to happen to us. ln religion class we talked about the sanctity of marriage. Pastor Slater said a man loves the woman he's married to, but when l look at my father, l know that that can't be true. My father never talks to my mother. He probably doesn't even remember her name. He doesn't let me do anything. l live in a prison too. l've done a lot of thinking about what love is. l think it's when you're willing to die for someone. Next time l see you, there's something l want to ask you. You don't have to ask me because you know the answer. l can hardly wait until J anuary 6 when you get released. Thomas. " Here ... and here's the letter. l think you have only yourself to blame for this. You can't do things like this. But l tell you, it doesn't mean a thing! Sorry, Kurath. l can't change it. "Dear Thomas, We were afraid something would happen and it has. l have to serve my full term to November 6 because they say l'm incorrigible. Kunz ratted on us. l can't expect you to wait for me now that this has happened. Being a homosexual is a curse because people keep finding new ways to ruin your life. l love you too, but l don't want you to worry about me anymore. l want you to feel free to go your own way. lt's much better to know that we can't be together than to not know what the next months will bring us. l'm going to say it again: l love you very much... and l know you understand what l'm trying to say. Martin. " So ... Okay, Kurath. See you next time around. No, you won't. l've had enough. That's what they all say. Well, l see you've made it through after all, Kurath. l hear you've got an engagement. lt's just a small theater. Okay, son, keep your chin up, and try not to come back . Thomas. Well, aren't you glad to see me? Of course. l just thought l'd never see you again, that's all. Let's stay together, okay? lf you want, we can leave the country. l've got some money saved. Almost 2,000 francs. lt's enough for a new start. All right. l'll talk to your father. Are your crazy? You can't do that. Can't l? Hello. Father, can we talk to you? What do you want here? - l wanted to-- - Mother, come in here. Where were you last night? With Martin, at the theater. Shouldn't we go in? What's keeping you, dear? Mr. Manzoni, can't we speak reasonable about this? What do you mean, "reasonably"? My son is not your queen, Mr. Kurath. Mother, do you know where Thomas was all night? With Kurath! You father told you to be more careful, Thomas. Mrs. Manzoni, Thomas and l have known each other for two years. We like each other very much. Oh, so you like each other, do you? You hear that, Mother? Giorgio, don't get excited. l'm the one doing the talking! Now, don't get me wrong, Kurath. l don't want you to put funny ideas in my boy's head. He's not a faggot, understand? Yes, l am. And there's nothing you can say to change it. Giorgio, say something! What's that supposed to mean? Has he converted you? Nobody converted me. lt's just the way l am, period. Thomas, don't say things like that. l've come to you because-- You keep your paws off my boy. You're a bad influence. l thought this way we wouldn't have to meet in secret. l don't want you to see him at all! Everybody warned me about you. Even Director Reichmuth. l'm old enough to decide for myself who l want to be with! We only want what is best for you. Thomas, we only have your best interest in mind. Really? So that's why you stuck me in a job l hate and won't let me see Martin? You never did trust us enough. Maybe l should have told you that l can't stand girls. Stop it this instant! You're not queer! Do you want me to tell my colleagues my son fucks men in the ass? Giorgio! Mr. Manzoni, please let us live our lives the way we want to. Get out. - l'm going with him. - Say that again! Say that again! - Go ahead, hit me! - Giorgio, please! Go on, then. But don't you ever show your face here again. Please report to my office after work, and don't forget. ls that understood, Manzoni? Hello. What is it? We're closed. My name is Kurath. l'm a friend of Thomas Manzoni. Oh, really? Then you've come to the right place. Come in. Now, then. We can get down to brass tacks, gentlemen. l'd like you to tell me what you want from this boy. l've told him everything. He wants to throw me out. Wait a minute. l didn't say that. l said if you go back to your parents, everything will be fine. l'm not going back. Listen, l've told you a hundred times-- Sir ... Maybe it would be better if Thomas quits and goes back to school. He doesn't like it here anyway. So you're one of those guys that sends their playmates to school. Thomas is quitting as of now. Fine. Here is the rest of your pay. Sign this receipt. Come here. l've got some things l have to unpack. You can do it later, man. Come here! What is it? We've got our own place at last! Look at this view! lsn't it fantastic? And we live here. l still can't believe it. Aren't you even happy? Sure! Looks like we finally did it. Our own place, and you'll be back in school again. Cut it out! What will the neighbors say? l don't give a shit. Come on, cut it out! Come on! Cut it out! Hello. Mr. Manzoni, we have to take you into custody. Why? l'm not Manzoni. What do you want with him? We have a warrant here for Mr. Manzoni's arrest. Okay, come in. Please step forward, Thomas. ls it true that you live with Martin Kurath and that he supports you? No. That's what it says in your file. He doesn't support me. He's just my friend. That's beside the point. ls it true that Mr. Kurath is a homosexual? So am l. l didn't ask you that. l want to know if Kurath is a homosexual. Yes or no? Yes. All right. Mr. Manzoni. l want to get Thomas away from him or he'll make him a criminal too. Martin is not a criminal! You can't just interrupt like that without being asked. ls that clear? Yes. Based on Article 91 , Paragraph 1 of the Penal Code, l grant the parent's petition that, on the basis of mental and physical neglect, Thomas Manzoni will be placed in a reformatory. These are the house rules. Learn them by heart. lf you can adjust, fine, but if you think you can play the rebel here, you're mistaken. We play by the rules and expect you to do the same. Any questions? What about school? School? We don't have classes here. We don't need scholars. We need good laborers. You'll learn a trade here. lt'll give you a good start in life. - l want to go to school-- - Who makes decisions here, you or me? You'll start in the stables, and when you decide on a trade, tell Mr. Diethelm. He is your advisor. Understood? Yes. Here comes our little faggot! You're Manzoni, right? Yes. Get this straight: l don't want you messing up my group. lf you've gotta get your kicks, you can stick a carrot up your ass. Come on. So, here's your room. You can beat off as much as you want, but don't dirty the sheets or you'll have to answer to me. Don't worry. We'll make a man out of you, all right. Get your things unpacked and report to me. "Dear Martin, l think l must be in hell. Everything here is much worse than l expected. l don't know how l'm going to survive here. " Hand inspection! Out! For the last time, Schlumberger, wash your dirty paws! Where's the new boy? Here. Stand up when l talk to you. Well? Have you decided what trade you want to learn? l don't know. Oh, you don't know? Okay, starting tomorrow you're working in the nursery. No! There's no talking back around here. Get that straight! So ... Where are you working starting tomorrow? Enrico. Better do what he says or they'll put you in Group C. Be glad you got a job. Did you hear that, Manzoni? l still don't feel like it. So ... he doesn't feel like it. Three weeks in Group C and you'll be begging to work in the nursery. Fall out for exercises! l don't want to catch you writing any more love letters ... to your faggot friend. You hear me? Get ready for dinner! Get the lead out, you little cocksucker. Why do l have to strip, anyway? That's how it is in Group C. Dear! Yes, what's wrong? The faggot's flown the coop! What? The faggot's flown the coop! Kurath. Martin, it's me- Thomas! Why haven't l heard from you? Didn't you get my letters? What letters? l wrote at least 1 0 times! Didn't you get them? - No. - l've been trying to get you out. l talked to a lawyer, but he said the decision was final. Then l talked to the judge, but he sent me to your father. lt's such bullshit! l've got an idea. lt's pretty crazy, but it might work. l'm going to see an old friend tonight. He's going to help me-- - Oh, no you don't, Manzoni. - Thomas, what's going on? No, siree! The basketball practice is cancelled because Coach Greulich is ill. Good night. Benny! What's the hurry? Going to see Babette? You better believe it! Take the fag along. See if you can cure him. Oh, yeah! - Where are we going? - You'll see. Hot stuff. Who's that? That is Babette. Now, come. Hey, honey, you all turned on? The little faggot's gettin' scared! Come on. Everybody gets his turn. Look the other way or l can't get it up. Man, she's really rarin' to go. You guys do this all the time? Sure. This is our whorehouse. Beats jackin' off. Next, please. Whose turn is it? - l didn't get to last time! Oh, the poor guy! Okay, go to it! Wait a minute. Manzoni comes first. Are you crazy? You only fuck asses, huh? Come on. There's a first time for everything. You'd probably like one of us to get you off, wouldn't you? He's got a real hard-on! Don't be a chicken, Manzoni. Don't fight it, kid. lt's about time you learned how to fuck. - What's the matter? - lt was only a joke! Hey, Manzoni! Come back! - What an asshole. - Let him go. Whiskey ... yeah. Well, you got it? Sure. Let 'em see it. l don't do this for everybody. What are you going to do with it? l can't tell you right now. - l hope it's nothing-- - No, don't worry. Here you go. Thanks. What do you want for it? l don't want money. All right. These are some of the tools boys have used to escape. This sort of thing is not good for morale. lt is also the reason why we make such demands on our trainees. Dealing with delinquent boys is not an easy task. Yes, l know, Director. How long have you studied psychology? Six semesters. l personally don't think much of that hocus-pocus, Mr. G?rtler. lt's all theory and of no use in practice. You can't change a magpie into a nightingale, you know. Are you married? Engaged. My fianc?e is going to college in England. l'm afraid she won't want to visit you here. Let me explain. lt's the boys. When they see a woman they go crazy. Lucien! Keep working. Lucien is one of the few boys who really wants to improve himself. He'll show you around. Good luck on your thesis. A little practical experience will do you good. Come in. Mr. G?rtler is Mr. Diethelm's new teaching assistant. Diethelm's our best man. Strict but fair, right Lucien? Yes, Director. Today's quote is by Jeremias Gotthelf and goes: "You cannot untie a knot with frostbitten fingers. lf your soul is cold, easy tasks become difficult." You may begin. - Where is Manzoni? - He's in Group C. He tried to run away. Where are they? l'll show you the way. Group C is the worst group in the whole place. Once you're in it ... you're lucky if you ever get out alive. This is the one. l'm not coming in with you. Why not? l ... l just can't. Why not? Because of Andreas. Who's Andreas? He was a friend of mine. He hanged himself up there. Last year. On Christmas Eve. ln his cell, with a towel. lt's all right. l'll go alone. Bruno. Here are your linens. Kiss my ass. Martin, what are you doing here? l'll tell you later. Hey, what's wrong? What did they do to you? Thomas, tell me. What's wrong, Thomas? He put his cigarette out on me ... because l ran away. l'll get them to put you in the infirmary. l can't take it here anymore, Martin. l'll get you out of here. That's why l came. Cut this shit out! Back to work! See, G?rtler? That's poor, sick Manzoni, who you feel so sorry for. Back to work! Hey, look! The police! Get your dirty paws off me! Well, well. lf it isn't Scholz. They all come back sooner or later. And he used to brag that they'd never catch him! But they always do. He was out for three months though. So what? What good is it gonna do him? He's gonna get a month in Group C, starting now. Cigarette, Mr. Diethelm? Thanks. Why don't you put it out on Scholz's back? Shut up! Get back to work. You can only do that to me once, Professor. You really gave it to him, Mr. G?rtler. No one's ever talked to him like that. That about evens things up. l don't know what you were thinking, Mr. G?rtler, but you've gone too far. He made me look like a clown! l know all your theories, Mr. G?rtler. Trust, understanding, empathy. You won't get very far with them here, though. Self-discipline is the only thing that can hold our staff together. Playing Mr. Nice Guy to the boys-- We've seen it all before! You can see that Mr. Diethelm cannot work with you anymore. Under the circumstances, it's better we part ways. Whatever you say, Director. "All right, Thomas. This is our plan. Tomorrow night at lights out, you take off. Go to D?rrenmoos on foot and take the 1 1:22 train to Basal. l'll pick you up and we'll go to Bonn to See Clemends Krauthagen, a political friend of mine. l've already talked to him; he's expecting us. He's got contacts, and l hope he can get you a residence permit... to stay in Germany. They'll be looking for you in Switzerland. Everything will work out all right. You can count on me. See you tomorrow night. Your Martin. " lt was a good idea to come here, wasn't it? You're going to like my little place. Can't talk about these things in Bonn. Do you think you can get him a residence permit? Don't you worry. We'll take care of everything. Just let me think about it. l'll come up with something. l always do, don't l? Don't l, Richard? Yes. First we go home and relax a little, right boys? Wait until you see this. My collection is one of the most interesting in Germany. Okay, son, now we're going to do some strategic thinking. l've got it all planned. Now let me tell you how it's going to work. After breakfast we drive to Stuttgart and look up Chancellor Schaufele, and old buddy of mine. He's just the man to help us. lt's no good. l've got a rehearsal. l know. ln Munich, right? l've thought of that. Richard will drive you there. What about Thomas? He'll come down when this business is settled. My God, you won't die if you don't see him for a couple of days. l don't know ... Listen, my dear boy. lt's about time you decide. Either you want to find a way to stay in Germany or you go back to Switzerland to your reform school. - Do you want that? - Of course not. That's what l thought. This is Martin. Please try again. - The same number? - Yes, the same. Krauthagen residence. Hello? l've been trying to reach you for days. This is Martin Karuth. - Who is it? Kurath. Thomas' friend. Don't you remember me? ls Mr. Krauthagen there? No, he's not here. He said he'd be back by now. He promised me-- - Mr. Krauthagen is in Paris. And Thomas? ls he there? Sorry, but l think he went with him. What is that? Now's the time for me to play the savior of law and order. Our chances have never been better. You'd sacrifice my husband? - Do you want him to die? - l want to see him die. You are a beast, but l love a beast. My child, your hatred is nothing compared to my ambition. He'll suffer the fate of fools. You shall sit in Parliament. lt's desolate, seeing you inside prison walls, where prisoners and guards watch us. Here, at least we-- Let me see my beloved! Only you can make it possible! l mustn't be seen here ... l bid you forgive my lack of manners, in so forcing entry into your private chambers. Forgive my uncouth appearance, but you are my last hope ... "Dear Martin, l know l'm a bastard and a traitor... but l can't come back to you. l've always tried to be honest and not to do anything l didn't believe in deep down inside, but now l know you can't exist without taking advantage of people, even of those you love more then anyone else. Krauthagen got me a residence permit, but with the condition that l be his boyfriend and stay with him. He's not a bad person. He's just disappointed and lonely. There are only two alternatives: either l come back to you and land in the reformatory or l stay in Germany with Krauthagen. He cares for me as a son and wants to send me to school. Both ways are shitty, but there's no third alternative. l know l'm a bastard, but my life has been so rotten up to now. l love you as much as ever, and l promise you one thing: if things don't get better, l'm going to kill myself. Either way, my thoughts will be with you. Thomas. " Yes. What did you want? Who do you want to talk to? One moment. Martin. lt's for you. Thomas, where are you? At the station in Stuttgart. And Krauthagen? He kicked me out. Can you speak a little louder? l can't hear you. He kicked me out because l didn't want to sleep with him. And what about school? l'm not going. He didn't keep any of his promises. Are you still mad at me? l never was. l just kept hoping you'd make it somehow. l don't have any more illusions. What do you want me to do, send you some money? You don't have to. You wouldn't believe the things l've done. l was even a prostitute. Hard to believe, isn't it? Yes, it is. Should l come? l can take the night train after the performance. l'll be there tomorrow morning. We could make a fresh start. Could it ever be as it was. Remember how happy we were? You're the first person l've ever really loved in my whole life. l wanted to do everything right and did everything wrong. l can't go on. l'm going back to D?rrenmoos. Thomas ... say something. Bad news, Martin? Hello. Hello. Can l help you? Doesn't Martin Kurath live here? Yes, he lives here. Come in. Martin, you've got a visitor. Hello there. Enrico. Surprised to see me? l sure am. What's going on? Are you out of reform school? They let me out last week. l have to speak with you. Come on in. Sit down. Are you hungry? Would you like something to drink? No, thanks, not right now. l ... Helmut, please ... l don't want to disturb you. l'll call you later. Okay, Enrico, continue. Well, Mr. Kurath ... or should l say Mr. G?rther? lt's about Thomas. He doesn't know l'm here. But l thought it'd be better ... if l ... lf you what? Thomas is getting out of D?rrenmoos on Friday. Oh? He's 21 and he's passed his job examination. But l know ... you wouldn't recognize him. Why not? lt's just that ... Well, he's changed a lot. He does everything they tell him to. He even gets along with Diethelm. He doesn't even put up a fight anymore. He's really out of it. He won't come here. l know that. And-- And so l just thought ... now that he's getting out ... l was ...wondering if you could ... Yes, of course l will. But ...but don't be shocked when you see him. lt's just ...he's got a scar on his face. A scar? How did he get that? When they caught him and brought him back, well, Diethelm, took him and ... he gouged him with a sugar sickle. What are you doing here? You shouldn't drink so much. l told you they would break me down, and they did. lt's nothing to be ashamed of. There's something called a will to live. l didn't resist them. l just did everything they wanted. l closed my eyes and waited for everything to be over. lt's all over now, Thomas. Let's you and me try to-- l stood there and watched Diethelm beat a guy's head against a wall ... until he fell down unconscious. And l didn't say a thing. All l could think was, "l hope he leaves me alone." What could you have done, shoot him or something? A new Diethelm would have come. There are plenty of them around. Cut it out, Thomas. That's enough. And you? What do you mean? What have you done? Met some new guys? A new boyfriend? Nothing serious. Did you think of me sometimes? l did. l kept hoping you'd come back to me someday ... and that we could start living the way we wanted to at last. l didn't think of you at all. l fucked Babette with the other guys. lt was great. l jacked off with them too. Nothing wrong with that. Everybody does it. They're horny. l never wanted to be faithful to you. Remember that night in your cell? Did you really believe that ... you and me forever? We'll show the world, huh? Well, we really showed 'em, didn't we? Can't you stop drinking? l'm not taking orders from anyone anymore, not even you! Thomas, what's wrong? Open the door! Let's be reasonable. We can talk. Don't give up now. l love you. l really do, Thomas. l still believe in everything we said back then. Thomas, come out of there! This is the psychiatric clinic. One moment, please. l'll connect you. There is no reason for alarm. We have cases like this every day. That's what we're here for. How long will he have to stay here? Don't worry. He'll be over it in two, three weeks. And now we have a special announcement. Thomas Manzoni, 21, has been reported missing since Thursday, May 9. He is from Scheurental, unmarried, 5'8" tall, blue eyes, blond hair, oval face. The missing boy has a scar on the right side of his face from an accident. He escaped from the psychiatric clinic, where he was undergoing treatment. Any information, please give to the psychiatric clinic or to the closest police station. Thomas Manzoni suffers serious depression and may be confused. Should you find him, please approach him kindly and gently.
