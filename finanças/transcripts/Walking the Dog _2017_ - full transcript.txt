Unfortunately, as you know, The bradley beach town board Did reject our planfor the bike lanes-- I know. However, i have petitionedthe county court On the grounds that the town hasfailed to properly administer The safety of this community. So that meanswe'll be in court tomorrow At 10:00 a.m. And we're goingto fight this thing, And we're going to win. Okay, tomorrow, We'll show themwe mean business. Yes. Oh, hi, art. Are you goingto be there tomorrow? The more press for our casethe better. As long as barb keepsmaking these cinnamon rolls, I'll make this case"the telegram's" top story. Oh, so it's bribery, huh?

You know, this isn'tthe kind of play date I had in mind. I'm sorry,you know him? I'll tell you later. It is a delight To see so manyof bradley beach's citizens In attendance. We're here todayto hear oral arguments With regards to the petitionof the shore bicycle club Verses the town of bradley beach Concerning the creationof a bicycle lane. Ms. Simmons representsthe petitioner. Counselor? Thank you, your honor. Ordinance 243 Of the incorporatedtown of bradley beach, To paraphrase, States that one purposeof the town board Is to pass lawsfor its citizens' safety. The denial of the petitioners'request for a bike lane Creates a situation Directly contraryto the law's purpose. All right, quiet, please. Mr. Amos, i believe? It is. And good morning, your honor. May i complimentopposing counsel On the brief and lucid wayin which she stated her case. Wow, sweet-talker. However, The same ordinancems. Simmons referenced Goes on to state That any such lawspassed by the board Are also for the convenienceof its citizens. Creation of a bicycle lane Would eliminate200 parking spaces, Which would bea major inconvenience For the merchants, And a limit to accessfor the tourists, Upon whom the businesses depend. Right, point taken. Ms. Simmons? Yes, It's those touristswe're thinking of, your honor. They also bike, and shop, And have to weave aroundmoving cars. Now, no parking spaceswould have to be eliminated If we just removedthe present median From the centerof main street Per the trafficfeasibility study Admitted as exhibit 1.a. Couldn't that be done,counselor? Certainly,your honor. We could eliminatethe median. We could also eliminatethe sidewalks, And while we're at it, Why not eliminatethe stores, too? I noticed that. Overruled. Continue, mr. Amos. Under petitioners' logic, If we force the townto create a bicycle lane, Then why not a jogging lane? Or a skating lane,or a lane for surfers? Or for power-walkers-- That is ridiculous,your honor. And for the record, We don't consider this requestto be a joke. Our citizen's safetyis at stake. I'm just takingthe counselor's argument To its ultimate conclusion,your honor. Don't be smug. You've madeyour point, counselor. However, my courtroomis not the place For you to practiceyour stand-up routine. Now, i will takeboth of your arguments Under advisement. We are adjourned. Unbelievable.-right? Hey, dan. You know,you're the enemy now. Ouch. Hey, i'm your realtor,not your relative. I don't needto sugar-coat it for you. Come on, dan,i'm doing my job, It's nothing personal. Yeah, not for you, You'll be back in seattle. The rest of uswill be up here Dodging buses and suvs. Would it help If i bought youa steak dinner? Yeah, it might. Hold that thought. Thank you.it was nice seeing you. Bye. Hey, counselor,how about a coffee? How about never? I prefer coffee. I prefer not being mockedin front of the judge. Mere chitchatbetween dog owners. Come on,let's have a coffee And make peace. I'd rather havean herbal tea and a hot bath. Seems a little advancedfor our relationship. Funny. Look, i just thought That as long as we're goingto be working together-- We are notworking together. We are adversaries. Adversaries. Or didn't they teach you thatin law school? Some of my best friendsare my adversaries. That might beyour problem. I think you're getting meall wrong here-- Your license platesays "law one." I think i'm getting youall right. Okay, about that-- Tell simon i said hello. And his owner,"i'll see you in court." Oh, excuse me. Gidget... Oh, you're lucky you're cute. Seriously, gidge? Sorry, girl, we're gonnago see grandma instead. Huh. All right, come on. I don't know. I don't knowwhat's going on. If you having a dog Means i get to see youfor breakfast, I should've talked youinto this a while ago. Come on. So, i heard aboutthe new town attorney. Sounds like a handful. Oh, just the usualcareer-fixated narcissist Who happens to havea really cute dog. He brought his dog to court? No. Turns out,he's simon's owner. Gidget's valentine? Ex... Ex-valentine. There's no way I'm allowinga doggie play date now. His owner reminds me Of the guys i wentto law school with in chicago. Oh, the guys? Or that one guy in particularthat you broke up with? He broke up with me By datingthe senior partner's daughter. I was tryingto skip that part. Thank you. And yeah, sort of. I mean, they bothdrive porsches. Ooh, i alwayswanted a porsche. What? They're fun cars. The sun in your face,the wind in your hair... Okay. Come on, gidge. We're going for a jog Before we catcha mid-life crisis. Come on, gidge. Those crazy kids, You just can'tkeep them apart. You know, You were rightthe other day. I was out of line. What? No, i'm justlooking for the catch. Oh, no, no,no catch. Just sincerity. We can agreeto disagree, can't we? We can. Great. Maybe we couldeven reboot? Hi, i'm keith. I'm a lawyerfrom seattle, But i used to livenear bradley beach When i was younger, And recently gotthe chance to come back And do legal counselfor the town board. How about you? Did you grow uparound here? Taft high school. Bishop carlyle. You guys had a betterfootball team. True. Have coffee with me. I'm dating someone. I know. You--how do you know? I spoketo dan carlyle. Oh. And you have my wordthat this will be A strictly professionalcoffee chat. We could even discuss Settling the wholebicycle lane matter. "settling?" Hmm... Magic word. All right. Ah, excellent. Tomorrow. Noon. Beach cafe. I'm bringing simon... I'm bringing gidget. I'm quittingwhile i'm ahead. See you tomorrow. Simon! Come on, gidget! Hey... Here you go. Good boy. Hi. Hi. Come on. Gidget!

Huh. 10% off his nextteeth cleaning. No offense, but if this ismy only valentine's day gift, I think i am going to give up. You know what, just...just tell her i stopped by. Sure thing. Thanks, delia. And it really doeslook great. Honey,it's not that bad, And besides, The bit aboutdelia's dress Was kind of cute. Keith soundslike a rock star. I sound likea total amateur. No more free danishfor art. Yes, ma'am. And who's keith? Town attorney guy. Yesterday he wasa career-fixated narcissist, And today,he's just keith? We ran into each otherat the beach. I swear, gidget hasan internal homing beacon Where his dog is concerned. Anyway. What is... That? How didthose get there? Hmm. "coffee and your smilemake my day, every day." It's not signed. Does my motherhave a secret admirer? Don't be silly. You do, don't you? No, it's probablysomeone else's, And they accidentallyleft it there. It says "barb." Well, maybeit's another barb. In your cafe? Talking about yourcoffee, every day. It's someonewho comes here every day. Everyone comes hereevery day. Good point. Well, whoever it is,this is exciting. Right? I don't know. We're a communitythat prides itself On its active lifestyle. Even you, who's been herefor, like, a nanosecond Should see that. Okay, well,one of my jobs As town attorney Is to advise the board On whether an actionis worth pursuing. A bike lanewould cost a fortune For a town this size. For what, 50 cyclists? It's not worth that alone. What if there were more? How many cyclists can a townlike bradley beach have? So, you didn't reallyask me here To talk about settling. I may have beena little flippant before, But you can see my point. I see you thinkmy only objection Was to your tone. There wereother objections? Plenty. Your arrogance justgot added to the list. I am not arrogant. Kinda. Little bit.-no. But as it happens,you've given me an idea. I did? Yeah. Thanks, counselor. Come on, gidge. Am i goingto like this idea? Collecting signatures Seems like, um,a lot of walking. You go out dancingevery weekend At the goodman club. You can handle it. Funny you should mentiondancing. Uh, bill was here before, I think he noticedthe invitation. Invitation? The bar associationcharity dinner dance? Have you asked him to go yet? No, i'm not even sureif i want to go. Besides, he hates dancingjust as much as i do. He's the one that told meabout the goodman club. Really? He just stoppedasking you to go Because you kept saying no. Oh. Hmm. Ask bill to the dance. Okay. But first... Go, go. Thank you. We need all the supportwe can get. And, um, here you go. In case you change your mind. We've got great supportright now. We just need more. There you go. Okay. Petitioning fornew bike lanes in our town. It's a great cause. I have one for you.here you go. Hi. Will you supportour bike lane proposal? Hey... Hi. Hi there. If you just wantto put your name... Thanks so much. Okay... There you go. Sign right here. With the courts permission,your honor, I'd like to addan addendum to my pleadings. I'm listening. Oh, and i'd like to thankthe opposing counsel For this idea. Since mr.

Quiet, please. Any objections, counselor? None, your honor. All right. I will read overthe addendum To considermaking this change And let you know my decisionin a couple of days. Your move, law one. Oh, it's fabulous, honey. Nice write-up. Does this meani can go back To giving artfree pastries? Please? You're backin the danish, art. Yes... Oh, there's bill. Hey! Hey. I've been meaningto talk to you About the bar association dance. Oh, right. I'm afraid i can't make it. Because you hate dancing. What? No!I love dancing. Really? Because it'sgreat aunt linda's birthday, And i have to driveout to marysville. You're not upset,are you? No, of course not. I'm not sureif i'm even going. Oh, well, you can alwayscome with me if you like. Uh... I'd like to saythat's tempting-- But you'd be totally lying? It's okay,it's okay, i get it. Uh, but hey, we're stillon for dinner Friday night, right? We are. Great. Bye.-bye. Hey.-hey! Better getin there quick. Only onebear claw left. Ah, thanks for the tip. Don't know whyi did that. And hello, counselor. Hello, counselor. I have a question,what is this? You didn't read it? I don't know how. You're funny. Land dispute. A mrs. Agnes pittman Used to ownthis whole area. She used to sayshe kept it like this Because she lovedthe views, And the wholenature preserve part Was justa happy result. Everyone knew she wantedto leave this to the town, But sadly, she died Before transferring itinto a trust, And now her heir hassold it to a developer. Who, i'm sure, aregoing to leave it as-is For society's sake. So, another lawsuit? Either that, Or everything you seewill be high-rises. That would be a shame. It's reallybeautiful here. It really is. Have you gottena chance to get out And explore a little? Do some hiking? A little. I'd forgotten how muchi missed the views here And the quiet,which is especially nice. I've just been so focusedon my career lately. Define "lately." Pretty much sincegraduating law school. That'sa long "lately". Well, you put your noseto the grindstone, You lose track. Yeah, but thenall you see is grindstone. Look up. Better view, huh? Much. How longhave you had him? Uh, a couple of years. He belonged to an ex Who got a job in australia And couldn'ttake him with her. Is she coming back? She married a guyafter she got there, So probably not. Okay. I get it. What? I've had my heart broken, too. Really? Jeff from chicago. You guys wouldlike each other, actually. He also drives a porsche. Okay, i should explain. The car belongedto my late uncle bruce, And i was going to sell it... But have you ever drivenone of those? No, but feel freeto give my mom a ride. She'd thank you forever. Mental note taken. But, really, if you everwant to take a spin-- I gotta go,i'm meeting delia for dinner. Gidge? Simon! Simon, come on! Hey, simon, come on. Come on, boy, come here. Come on. Hey, simon,come here, buddy. Good girl... Okay, if we just, uh...-turn the other way! Um, i'm trying. You-you just... Gidget, just...well, turn the other way. Simon...-oh, hello. Hey, folks,good to see you. You have a good day. Okay, just... Turn the other way.-i'm trying. Chocolates! I found them at the doorwhen i opened this morning. He's definitely interested. They're my favorites. Who could they be from? Who would be interested in me? Hey, no... Don't do that. Well... It's been a long time. Ten years. Mm-hmm. I've just assumedthis part of my life was over, And i don't know what to expect. Well, maybe don't haveany expectations. Just... Let it be what it'll be, Go from there. Yeah. Yeah. Simon enjoyed seeinggidget yesterday. How about tonight? I have dinner plans, thanks. Tomorrow night? Simon and gidgetaren't the only ones Who can be dogged. That was a terrible pun. I got a million of 'em. You're nothelping your case. Sure about that? You two look likeyou're enjoying yourselves. Are you going to let us inon the joke? Just a dog owner joke,your honor. Not that interesting. All right, i have hada chance to review The motion to acceptthe new petition, And it looks sound to me. Mr. Amos,any objection To the addendumexpanding the bike lane To include additionalsporting activities? None, your honor. Then i will accept the motion, And it will be enteredinto the record. We will resume the hearingon this matter on thursday As scheduled. So, this is nice, huh? It's lovely. Ooh, i heard they havea new bolognese recipe. Oh. I'm thinking the salmon. Always a safe choice. Oh. Did you orderchampagne? No, i thoughtyou did. I did not. I... I wonder who? Oh. Keith. Keith? Who's keith? Oh, the town attorneyi told you about. Thank you. That's funny, i waspicturing someone... Older. Do you thinkyou could stop flirting, And get down to the reasoni asked you out tonight? I am just being politeto a colleague. Is that what they'recalling it these days? We are battling each other In a very important caseright now. About a bike lane. I'm here in mayberry by the sea To talk to you about somethingthat's actually important. Your future with the firm? Yes, i thought that wouldget your attention. Is there some sort of problem? The exact opposite. The partners like That you've been brought inas an advisor here. It was smart to takethat position. That was the general idea. There are some things brewing With some propertythe firm represents. Nothing concrete just yet, But this littlebike path-- Lane. It's a bike lane. Whatever. Bike thingyou have going on Could put you in positionfor something a lot bigger, And i know bigger is your goal. I'm intrigued. Good. We want you to be. Who do you think she is? I don't know,probably his girlfriend. No, he doesn't havea girlfriend. How do you know that? Hmm? Well, they just, i don't know, They don't seemlike a couple to me. Clearly. Thanks forthe champagne. My pleasure. Hope you enjoyed it. We did. Did you and your dateenjoy dinner? Oh, it wasn't a date,we just work together. Oh. In fact, here she is. Laura presley,this is kristie simmons. My associateand my opposing counsel. Hello.-hello. I hear you've been keepingour legal beagle on his toes. Uh, so far. Well, don'twear out the boy. Our firm hasbig plans for him. Well, good night. I'll see youin court. Shall we? Yes. Found it. Hmm? My scarf. Shall we? Yeah. Good morning. I will now hear oral argumentson the plaintiff's motion Regarding the creationof a recreational lane. Ms. Simmons? Your honor, citing the caseof ogden versus illinois, The 2nd circuit ruled in favorof a community swimming pool Over the state's rightto develop the land For business purposes. With respect, your honor, Ogden was overturnedby the 9th circuit, Stating that tax revenue Supersedes the community'suse of the land For recreational purposes. Which was modifiedby the 10th circuit, Stating property takenin eminent domain Was set aside in order to builda community hospital. A bike lane is not a hospital. Recreational lane. And neither is a swimming pool,but the same principle applies. Not it's used solelyfor recreational purposes, Which a hospital clearly is not. Rebuttal, counselor? Well, i'd say, uh... Yes. Yes, uh, state of maineverses brewster, Where a recreational lanetook precedence Over a waterfront mall. Mr. Amos? But it was remandedto a lower court. Where it was upheld... Six to two. All right.quiet, please. Good work, counselors. I will take your argumentsunder consideration, And will ruleon the matter shortly. Quite a performance, counselor. Back atcha, counselor. Will i be seeing you At the bar association dinnertonight? I haven't decided yet. He can't make it. That doesn't meanyou can't go. It is greatfor networking. I head up a committeethat does pro bono work For returning vets, And we could really usesomebody like you. What? You... You just surprised me,that's all. I got as many good surprisesas i do bad puns. Hmm. Hmm... Yeah, me neither. No. Okay. What did i ever do without you? Why do they alwayshold these things Near valentine's day? It's so... Red and white. Looking for bike path girl? Bike lane. It's an important distinction. And what makes you think... Excuse me. You came. I did. And you look beautiful. Thank you. You clean up nicely yourself. Thanks. And i feel compelledto point out That i do haveother good points. You do?-i do. I'm also a very good dancer. Shall we? Kristie? Jeff? Hey... What are you doing here? I could've sworni left you in chicago. I moved backto seattle last year. Well, you remembertodd donally, right? Oh, right,good old todd. He's right over here,do you want to come say hi? Not remotely. How's, uh... Tiffany? Yeah... We, uh, broke up. She married one of the partnersin the firm, so... That's a shame. But you look... Amazing. Doesn't she? Do you have a moment? I think they'replaying our song. Is that our song? Mm-hmm, yes,that is our song. Since when doeskristie simmons dance? Since she foundthe right partner. You okay? Yeah. That was weird, right?

Any interest in meis strictly business. No, no, ms. Simmons, The man you see in front of you Is 100% date-free. I find thatvery hard to believe. Right? But there is one woman, Who's smart and funny... Keeps me on my toes. Really?-definitely. And i send hera million hints, And she just keepsshooting me down. Well, she must haveher reasons. Maybe.

I'm going to meetmy secret admirer. Oh, wow. What harm can come, right? It's just a date. Exactly. So why do i feel so guilty? Mom... You know dad would'vewanted you to be happy. I am happy. With the cafe, with my friends, And you. I know. I know, but nowyou have a chance At a different kind of happy. Who knows if anythingwould even come of it, right?

And i couldn't believe That jeff triedto invite me to his table To see his friends. I've never been so happyto see keith amos In my life. Oh, so keith was there? Well, yeah, Along with a couplehundred other lawyers. But, you and keith,you saw each other. Mm-hmm. Did you...dance together? Yeah, just as a wayto deal with jeff.

Is it finally a date? This is finally a date. Michael... Yeah, a little scoopfor "the telegram."

I like that plan. See you soon. I look forward to it. Me too. hello? Hey, dan, you got a sec? Sure. What's up? I wanted your adviceon maybe getting a place That's a little more... Long-term.

But you'd like for it to. What? No. I mean... Only if you're... Okay with it. I could not bemore okay with it. Really. Really? In fact, it's probablya good time for me to admit That keith and i-- Keith amos is the worst! He's siding with the developers. What is it? Hey, come on in. I thought i was the onepicking you up. What's going on? Hold on. That makes us adversaries.again. I haven't given the boardmy recommendation. Then how did it getin the paper? I don't know, maybelaura jumped the gun-- Because she knewthat was the plan, right? There is no plan, kristie. I haven't cometo a conclusion yet. Keith, there's onlyone conclusion, I thought you understood that. I thought you understoodthis place. I thought... And for the sakeof complete clarity, The date is off. Tonight and allfuture nights. Kristie... Hey... I know, boy, i'm sorry. I feel the same way. Looks likei'm going to have to do more Than talk my way outta this one. Not today, girl. Different direction. Come here, simon, come on. You see, gidge,this is what happens When i let go of expectations. I get hurt. You know why we haveexpectations. Because we have the experience That allows usto anticipate results. So, you know, let's say,for instance, You have your heart broken By a particularly handsomebreed of dog. Well, then, You should expect to havethe exact same heartbreak When you are stupid enough To fall for the same breedof handsome dog. I mean, definition of insanity,am i right? So right... Oh. Ms. Simmons? Councilman snyder. I was just working on a...a-a speech to a jury. Helps to practicein front of an audience. Ah. How can i help you? Well, as you may be aware, We're in the middleof making a decision right now On whether or notto approve a plan To develop the pittman property. The paper saidthat had been decided. No, no, we're close, But we're stillin the information gathering Part of the equation. You should know that the boardwas very impressed With the way you-- Oh, now, how did carter put it? Took us to the woodshedover the bike lane lawsuit. Now, i understand You may have an opinion or twoabout the pittman matter? You bet i do. Good. We're meetinglater tonight. I'd really loveto hear your thoughts. Oh, uh, tonight? Yeah, i'm sorryabout the late notice. We only just had your namepresented to us. Presented? By whom? Keith amos. Oh. Hi. Uh, hi. Meg, come on in, I have that paperworkfor you to sign. He's not here. Where is he? Since he quit the firm,it's really none of my business. Keith quit? He didn't tell you? No. We haven't spokenin the last couple days. That makes two of us. Look, i'm not surewhat i'm supposed to do here. Well, you'd better be prepared To give your perspectiveon the pittman project, Because i am. Come on, keith,pick up, pick up, pick up... hey, this is keith,leave a message. and i'll get back to you soon-- Hi, bill. Hey. Listen,margie is back in town, And she wantedto pick up gidget. do you think you couldbring her by tonight? and i'd also liketo thank the council for this opportunity. Sorry i'm late. It took a lot longer To get all these peopletogether than i thought. What kind of stuntis this? It's not a stunt. It's just citizensbeing concerned About their community. Keith,what's going on? We're going to presentour case to the board. No, no, no, no. I just found out about this,i am not prepared. This is an anxiety dreamcome to life-- You are prepared, kristie. Trust me, And just let it bewhat it'll be. Ladies and gentlemenof the board, thank you For giving us this opportunityon such short notice To present our case Against the developmentof the pittman property. Well, you certainlyhave us intrigued, mr. Amos. However, it is valentine's day, And some of us do haveplaces to be. I understand,councilman snyder, And you will be out of hereand off with mrs. Snyder In under 10 minutes. Now, as your formertown attorney, It was my jobto present you With the various hurdlesyou'd have to overcome In orderto fast-track authorization. Environmental impact studies, Separate zoning variancesfor water, sewage, And electricity. Fire, police, And emergencymedical impact studies, Which would takearound five to seven years, Not countingcommunity resistance, And various... Lawsuits, All of whichwould cost this town More thanthe projected revenue From the development itself. Here's copiesfor everyone. Now, all of this,it's just data. What really matters hereare the people, And how this proposeddevelopment would impact them, And for that, I give you miss kristie simmons. Just speakfrom your heart, Tell them how you feel. You got this. Hello. Keith-- Mr. Amos-- Mentioned all of the operationaland logistical reasons To oppose this development, But i think that can be saidabout most every development. Why this beachis so important to save Is what i would liketo speak to. Uh... My mom once said The unofficial mottofor this town should be "there's more to life," Because that's whatthis community brings To each of us, The perspectiveon what's really important. And that beach is the heartof this community, It's in our name. Mrs. Pittmankept the land like it is Because she lovedthis town, But nobody expecteda nature preserve To develop from the beach, And yet, somehow,that's what happened, And now, The beauty of that preserve Is what draws peopleto this place, And what keeps them here. And if we lose that... For what, condos? ...we lose the very heartof who we are as a community, And i believewe're better than that. I hope you do, too. Thank you. I move to acceptmr. Amos' recommendations And to table all discussionson the proposal For the time being. All those in favor? Motion carried. I am so proud of you, honey! Gidget! It's okay, girl.it's okay. Where's margie? Uh, she had to go home, But i can take gidget to her. She passes on her thanks. Here's the deal, bill. I can't say goodbye to gidget. She's mine, And i'm sure margie Is an amazing,generous foster mom, But like i said... Gidget's mine. Oh, i already told margiethat you'd be a failed foster. Or in your case,a failed foster foster. You did? I did. Look, we may not have beena great couple, kris, But we were always good friends, And good friendsnotice these things. Gidget's been yourssince the first paw-shake. You're a pretty good guy,bill nolan. I am, right? Oh, and in caseyou were curious, Delia is at my mom's caferight now For the valentine's celebration. I don't know if maybe...you wanted to stop by. Good friendsnotice these things. Um, well, i mighthave to make an appearance. See you there? Yeah. I just have to checkon one thing. Sounds good. What now? Hey. You look... Wow. Um, did you helpwith all the decorations? Yeah, it's... Kind of my thing. It's a good thing. Yeah. Um, you know,the goodman club has a... A... Valentine's day dance? Yes. Would you maybe... Yes. Okay. Um... Shall we? I'll get--we shall. Okay. I just don't believekeith would leave Without saying goodbye. Oh, keith hasn't left. But there's a "for lease"sign at his house. Yeah, that's because We got him a morelong-term rental. He was even thinkingabout buying. Well, thenwhere is he? Excuse me, hi. Is therea kristie simmons here? Yeah, that's me. Oh. Thanks. "simon is waitingfor his valentine." Waiting where? Come on, gidget. Okay... Let's go find them. Let's go find them... Come on! Okay, go get. Sorry i ran offafter the decision, But i had a lot of work to do. You certainly did. Yeah, i had to makeour first date memorable. Mission accomplished. I don't knowhow you top this. Well, i've got plenty of time tothink of something Now that i'm unemployed. No, not so fast, counselor. There's a rumor going around That the town board wantsto put in more parking meters. Heathens. And if they do, i'm goingto need reinforcements. For that, and any other schemesthat come their way. Counselor, did you justoffer me a job? Mm, no, counselor,i can't afford that, But maybe... A partnership? Are the benefits good? Hmm... Well, great viewsaway from the grindstone, Lots of play dates for the pups, And a considerable amount of...
