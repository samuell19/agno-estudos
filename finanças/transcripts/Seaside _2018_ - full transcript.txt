Well, are you just going to stand there? That depends on you. Really? I don't think so. Kiss me. If you let me in. You are the worst. You are. Oh, not on your life. Oh, come on, you might like it if you try it. How's he doing? I don't want to talk about it. Roger! Where's Roger? - Roger. - Yep? He won't be awake much longer. I need to give him his meds. One sec. Go ahead. That feel good? Mm, wonderful. Thank you, baby. All right, let's do your legs and feet next. Can't say no to that. Tell me about your day, baby. There's nothing special. Just dealing with these two fancy mama's and their two fancy babies. Sounds familiar. Did another bill from Wells Fargo come? I didn't see it. Are you sure? What are you going to do about it if it did come? How are you going to pay it? I get paid next week. Your $12 an hour won't cut it. It'll help, Ma. Did it come? Did it come? We are not losing this house. Ma. If I didn't see it, it didn't come. Fine. I'm having a drink with Twyla later. I'll probably just crash at her place. That girl from work? She must have a really nice place. It's just easier and closer. She lives on the west side. You sure you don't have someone you're not telling me about? Ma... Stop. Okay. Okay. Rog, let me in. Roger, come on. Baby, what's wrong? My dad. Fuck him. Fuck him. I'm sorry. Oh, shit. Babe. I got to go. I'm sorry. Will you be okay? You can go out the front door now. Are you sure? We're free. I'll be back soon. Hey. Hi. Hey, you. Are you sure you want me there? Yes, of course I do. Hey, I need you. Please? Okay. After you. This is a sensitive family matter. Roger, we should probably speak privately. Yeah, well, Daphne is my family now. Good morning. Daphne, welcome. - Have a seat, Roger. - I'm good right here. Your father was concerned that you are not living up to your potential. Cut the bullshit, Zorn. Your father left you the beach house. And? And it's a property of significant value. He set up a trust that would pay for all of its upkeep, taxes, everything is taken care of. Big fuckin' deal. Why don't you tell me about the money. The 15 mil or so that should be mine. You father thought that you would benefit from learning how to support yourself. - What the fuck does that mean? - Roger, please. It means bar-tending while you're waiting for you inheritance is not a career. What about the Portland house? He left you the beach house. The remainder of his assets are going to be set up into a trust for any heirs that you may have. - Your children. - Yeah, I know what heirs are. If and when you have any, they'll inherit 100 % of the trust's assets. And what if there are no kids? - What then? - Then the money will be divided up into charities of his choice. And you're the asshole who determines what those charities are. - How fuckin' convenient. - Roger, stop. Roger, I have always followed my clients instructions whether if I agreed with their assessments or not. Did you follow his instructions when you were fucking him? - Roger. - No! Like father like son. No, Roger is different. Honestly, Daphne. I'm surprised to see you here. I strongly urge you to reconsider your involvement. You may find this hard to believe but we love each other very much. Then best of luck to you. Baby! - Baby, are you okay? - That bastard, he's just doing this because we're together. It's okay, it's over. - He's gone. - No, no, no. No, listen, maybe his passive aggressive shit is the best thing that ever happened to us. Ever since you came back into my life I knew we were meant for each other so let's do it. Let's get married, let's have kids. Daph, you love me, right? We get the fuck out of town, we go to the beach, we live our lives how we want to and we tell everyone else who thinks they know what's best for us to fuck off, hmm? - When? - Now. Tomorrow, tomorrow, next week, whenever you're ready. But I have a job. - I can't just walk out. - Two years and you're still assistant floor manager, you're better than that. Hey, I want you, I want this. Let's make it official. Is that a yes? - Yes. - I can't hear you. - I said, yes. - Yes? - Yes. - Is that a yes? - A yes? Is that a yes? - Yes! Do you want anything else to eat? No, Ma. I'm fine. For what? It's for work, I told you, it's a retreat. My daughter, look at me. I wasn't born yesterday, you know. I put some dinners in the fridge for you and if you need anything just call me. Look at me. Don't you trust me? Of course, Ma. I don't want you getting hurt... I am 24. I'm not a child anymore. ...or doing anything stupid. I put some money on the mantle and if Wells Fargo calls, just tell 'em the checks in the mail. - You okay? - Yeah, yeah, uh... Why don't you go on in? I'll be in in a sec. - You sure? - Yeah, yeah. Roger! Roger! Lookin' for something? It used to be my favorite thinkin' spot. Want to come inside? What, you scared? No. Woo. Did Zorn really sleep with your dad? Why? Well, that's seriously unethical. I don't really remember much from back then. After my mom died I was pretty wasted most of the time. So, maybe you should contest the will. Yeah, maybe. I'd see Zorn in the morning sometimes. So, she was? He never admitted it though. Like I said, I was pretty on fleek with the drugs at that point so-- Oh, no. Stop. That's wrong. What? That's just not how you say it. On fleek? Well, how do you say it? Well, you don't use it to describe how fucked up you are. Well... were. - Then tell me how to use it. - No. It's not happening you just stick to your stoner white boy talk. Talk like a stoner white boy? Yeah, you do. You talk like a rich stoner white boy. Well, is that a problem? No. Your dad come here much alone? I don't know, why? It doesn't seem like anyone's been here for a long time. He was sick. Well, yeah, I know. I just meant... around... on the beach. Rog. Um... You know, my mom's father built this house. She loved it here. And he couldn't stand it. So, he made sure I couldn't stand it either. And then he gave it to me. - Wait, you think he thought it all out like that? - Yeah. He wanted me to be just like him. On the company and all that bullshit. He was a sick fuck. Honey, you are nothing like him. You ready to get married? Today? Yes, today. But I don't have anything to wear. Oh... I know just the place we could fix that. Ready? - Yeah. - Well, come on, show me. You look perfect. Thanks. God, are you there? It's me, Roger. Ow. Ha ha. Well, I think I know why you're here. - We're ready for business. - Well, you certainly get points for enthusiasm. Well, when you know, you know. Oh, love, it's just wonderful. Can I please see your license? License? We're in love, that's not enough? Sorry, it's the law. No escaping. Fuck. - Damn. - I, uh-- I'm sorry, I just-- I, ah. Three days, my dear, and I'll be more than happy to marry you. - Hey, Daph, Daph! Come on, slow, hold on. - How could I be so stupid? Hey, shh, shh. It'll happen, okay three days, hey. Three days is nothing. Three weeks ago we were sneaking around like naughty teenagers and now we are in this beautiful town, together, with our own casa. Come on, let's do something fun. Like what? Well, I don't know. Something stupid like bowling, or go-carts... or Funland. Oh! You're too-- this is not fair! Didn't even make it all the way up there. This is great, babe. Yes. Yes! I won! I won! Sorry. - Congratulations. - Thanks. - You proud of yourself? - I'm so proud. - Chad. Chad. - What do you get? Look you get the little elf. The skeet ball machine's broken, can you fix it? Hey. Hey. Um, Daphne this is... this is Susanna. Nice dress. Thanks... we're getting married. Wow. Ah, you hungry? Let's go get some grub. - But we-- - No, come on. Come on, let's go. Here. A wedding gift. Thanks. What? I need a drink. Great idea. It's nothing. What's nothing? That girl, Susanna. We hung out sometimes, like, a big group of people during the summer, it was a long time ago. - Okay. - Yeah, and that's it. It's nothing. It was a long time ago. Maybe us not... getting a license is a, a... a sign. Oh, wait. What? So now you don't want to do this? I do. What is wrong? Nothing, I... I do. I just. Look, you coming? No. Suit yourself. Hi, Mom. How you doin', baby? Well, it's beautiful here, Mama. I know what it looks like. - When are you comin' back? - I'm not sure. I think I might stay a while longer. Well what about your job? I need a change of scenery. You know... a chance to try something new. What do you mean a change of scenery? That jobs a dead end. Excuse me, that is a good job. You need that job. - We need it. - I thought my $12 an hour didn't cut it? Who's there? No one. Daphne, you need to level with me. Please... Don't you want me to be happy? It is not always about happy. Well, I know, believe me, I know. I have to go. How much have you had to drink? Not enough. Daph. Daph, wait. Da-- - Daph, let me in! - No. - Come on. - You're being a dick. Come on! - Come on! - No, I just want to go to sleep. - Look, I'm sorry, okay? - Look, I just... I really need to out of this stupid wedding dress. No, no, no, no, no, don't, I-- don't. Okay, listen, listen, I have a surprise for you, okay? Okay, just count to-- count to 100. No, no, no, 500. Count to 500 and then just look out the window. Roger... I'm not counting to 500. Okay, okay, okay, um. Well, I'll text when I want you to come out. Fine. Okay. Welcome to the rehearsal dinner for the wedding of Miss Daphne Miller to Mr. Roger Kessler. Would the future Mrs. Kessler like a smore? Come on, the smore is a staple of the northwest summer camp beach diet. How healthy. All right, let's see. How about this one? Yeah, sit. Now, would you like it golden brown... or thoroughly scorched? Thoroughly scorched. Oh, yeah, that's getting there. - All right. - All right, there we go, there we go, there we go, this is the one. That's a beautiful, that's beautiful. Okay, will you do me a favor and take this. All right. And... oh, God. That is gooey. All right. Thanks for coming. What took you so long? Just exploring. See what I could find. Did you find anything? Uh, oh, uh, been waitin' for you. Let's go. - Where? - Come on, you'll see. My dad and I used to hike up here when I was little. Looked down at the beach and... all the people down there as little ants. We'd imagine what to do with 'em. And what was that? Well, we were God and they were our little people that we, uh... we created and controlled. Pick 'em up like this... and squeeze 'em... till they popped. That's rough. Yeah, dad always said that... individuals don't really matter in the grand scheme of things. And what about love? And what about it? Do you believe that love changes people? True love. Want to make a baby with me? Here? Yeah, why not? It's au naturel. What? Did you hear that? Someone might be watching us. Hello? See, just us. What the fuck? What the fuck?! - Rog. - Motherfucker! Where are you going? You crazy bitch, get the fuck away from us! Roger! Stay the fuck away! What happened? It's that bitch from the arcade. Ten years ago, fuck. That's it. Okay, I swear nothing else happened. She's trash. She's obsessed with me. She claimed I got her pregnant and she was just after my fuckin' money. Daphne, say something. Please. God, I... I swear she is a crazy, lying... and, and... I was high half the time. It didn't mean anything. Daphne, look at me. Daphne, please. Say something, anything. Well, it's not my fault. Oh, it's not your fault? - Bullshit. - I didn't know that she worked there. Damn you. I didn't say anything because it doesn't matter, it means nothing. Doesn't it? No, it doesn't, not to me. I mean, if you hadn't started talking to her about the wedding-- Don't blame me! I didn't fuck her. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll make this right. I'll go talk to her. Now? We're supposed to be getting married in the morning. Okay. Okay, I guess. Go for it. Come on. Maybe you should try that again. That's it, beautiful. Congratulations. Hey. - Your pretty new wife not doing it for you? - Why, you want in on the act? - What's that supposed to mean? - It means you were the one spying on us. Did you get your rocks off? You're not supposed to be here, you know? - Hi, mom. - Good to hear you voice, baby. How you doin'? I'm okay. What are you hiding from me? I think I made a mistake. - What happened between us-- - Dropping me off at a Planned Parenthood and then driving into the sunset, isn't exactly between us. That was a long time ago, I had to. You had to? You had to what? Follow your daddy's orders instead of doing right - by your girlfriend? - I'm so sorry. Why, baby? What is it? It's... It's Roger. Mama... I love him, Ma. No, baby, just... get away from him. Stay away from that man. Daphne, do you hear me? I miss you, you know? Hey. - Hey, hey-- - No, no, no. I hope you can understand one day. Hi, uh... Have you seen my husband? Roger Kessler? Nope. Well, what about Susanna, is she here? Sorry, she's off today. Can you just tell me where she lives? It's really important that I find her. I'm sorry, I can't give you that information. How did you get in here? You left the door open. Where's Roger? He's not here. Well, everything was fine until you started watching us. Yeah, well what was I supposed to do? I haven't heard from you in weeks. You stopped texting. Well, Roger started asking who I was texting. That's why I had to get rid of it. I thought he stole you away from me. No. Of course not. But we can't steal his money if he doesn't have it. You know... he denied everything. He said that you slept together... but only once. Are you serious? God. That fucking asshole. Well, he deserves to be taken down. Yes. But things aren't that simple anymore. I mean... Who knows how long it'll take until I get pregnant? When did you stop taking the pill? Three weeks ago. That money is ours. We deserve it. Yes, but that means I have to spend nine more months with him. I'll be here, I'm here. But I won't be able to see you. Or touch you. And I have to walk around carrying his baby. I have to go to that stupid arcade and play those fucking games just to see you? I can't do that. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Look, you are. All of those years of him and his family fucking over everyone. And we get the money and we run. We go some place amazing and we never look back. I will finally get out of this shit hole town. No more stares from people calling me a slut for something that was not my fault. We'll go, we'll go to Italy, or Paris. What? As long as I'm pregnant... then it doesn't matter what happens to Roger. Daph, no. I'm not waiting nine more months. Wait, wait, we can't. Well, you said it, we deserve that money. Do not forget what he did to you. And to me. Oh, shit. - It's that lawyer. - Well then don't, don't answer it, not yet. I have to. Hello? Daphne? Alec Zorn. Your boyfriend attacked a local piece of trash, turns out she had a restraining order against him. - He's been arrested. - Well, is he okay? Just calm down, everything is okay. You know, your mother wouldn't be too happy to hear about this. And now you care about my mother. Whatever, Daphne, don't say I didn't warn you. Hi, I'm here to pick up my husband, Roger Kessler. I'll just have you fill out this form. Sure. - I'll have an officer get him. - Thank you. - Baby, hey. - Let's get out of here. - The bitch called 911. - Well, why? - Fuck. - Because she's fucking insane that's why and I never touched her. - Fuck. - So, she lied to the police? Yes, people lie all the time. Can't you understand that? And where's the fucking keys? And this was all over and done with until you made me come back here and look for some perfect little life. Get in. Daphne, now! Let's go. You know, you're sounding a lot like your father. - Roger. - Fuck you. Roger! Are you, ah... I'm fine. Just go away. No, it's okay. I can go, it'll just take a sec. You sure? Mm-hmm. Finding everything all right? Oh, yes. Thanks. Okay, um, let me know if you need anything. - I will. - Okay. Actually... I need a pregnancy test. Which one do you recommend? Um... I like that one, I used that one when I had my daughter. But whatever, that's just me. Is everything okay? Daph? I'll be at the register, if you need anything. Thanks. Oh, have you seen my wife? - Excuse me? - You were just talking to her. The first black person in here in about a decade. Yeah, so? Fuck. What are you doing here? I think he knows. Daph, where the hell are you? Wait, how could he know? He's been acting really strange. Really aggressive. You didn't say anything, did you? No. And you threw away your other phone, right? Yeah. I smashed it into a million pieces and I threw it into the surf. Good. It's time. Are you pregnant? You are going to be an amazing mother. I'm scared. Daph, we're doing this. But right now I'm handing out cotton candy and stuffed animals to fat tourists. That's... That's pretty. Yeah... my mother gave it to me. Do you want it? Really? Yeah. Open the door. Have you seen Daphne? Susanna, I know you're in there. - Have you seen her? - I'm going to call the police if you don't leave. If you see her tell her to get back to the house and to stay the fuck away from you. How did he know I was here? You didn't say anything. No, nothing I swear. Well... we have to do it now. I should go. I... I love you. I love you, too. Where the hell have you been and why haven't you answered your phone? Well? Did you get it? Yes. And? Roger, I just got home. Will you give me a sec? No. We need to know now, come on. - But-- - Come on, let's go. - You weren't shy before. - Please, come on. Were you with her? - Who? - "Who." Susanna. She told you I got her pregnant didn't she? That is a God Damn lie. Stop. Okay, go. Be right here, waiting to hear the good news. What's happening? I have a right to know. Well? Yes. Fucking, yes. Fucking awesome. Hi, Ma. You don't know what you're doing. - Trust me. - You don't know. You don't know what that family did to us. I know, Ma. Believe me, I know. Daphne, no more games. - I'm going now. - Daphne... He's your-- He's your brother. Do you hear me? Daphne, do you hear me? You're actin' really fuckin' weird. I'm just nervous about the baby. Everything's going to be fine. I'm goin' for a walk. Are you coming? You want me to? What... your family did to my mother... and what you did to Susanna... You have to pay for that. What the fuck? Do it, now. Give it here. Hello? Rog? Why didn't you call the police? I thought it was just his drinking. I thought he'd come home again. Do you have any reason to believe that he's in trouble? You know your mother called, she's concerned. She said she just found out about you and Roger recently. How do you think she feels about you being with her former employer's son? I don't know, I'm not her. Daphne, is there something you're not telling me? I'm pregnant. After his father raped and beat her how would you feel if you were in that position? I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know anything about that. Cut the crap. I'm the one that wrote up the confidentiality agreement. You and I both know what happened. I know that I love Roger. I know that I'm carrying his child. I know that I need to find him. A young man disappears just after his new wife gets pregnant making her eligible to inherit his father's fortune. That same wife has strong motive for revenge because of the father's long history with violent behaviors. That doesn't sound suspicious to you? About as suspicious as you fucking his father and becoming executor of his will. You are smarter than I thought. I hope I can say the same thing about you. What are you doing here? Someone might see us. I know, I had to see you. I can't stand this anymore. I know. Can we go? I, I can't be here much longer. You need to wait. We don't have the money... yet. Daphne, you there? Baby, what's going on? He's gone, Ma. What? When? Two days ago. Thank you. Thank you, that makes me very happy. Now, you get away from there and come home. Come home and get back to normal. We'll see. Susanna Anderson. You're under arrest for the murder of Roger Kessler. I, I don't know what you guys are talking about. - Turn around. - Get your hands off of me. - Put your hands behind your back. - What? You guys have no proof, - I didn't do anything. - We have all the proof we need. Now get the fuck off. - Hold still, hold still. - No, I didn't... Settle down. Fuck, shit. - Got it? - Yup. Got her. Are you Mrs. Daphne Kessler, the wife of Roger Kessler? - Yes. - I'm detective Green, this is detective Gray. May we come in? Sure. She was afraid she might be pregnant and she thought her husband had cheated on her with an ex. Did she seem worried to you? Um... Well, she said the ex-girlfriend was really angry... Dangerous. Susanna could be real intense. Sometimes if you just looked at her wrong she'd freak out. Do you have any reason to suspect that Daphne Kessler was involved? - In the murder? - Absolutely not. Don't you think it's odd that she got pregnant so quickly after they got married? Well, what's odd about two young people having sex? Did you threaten the Kesslers? No, I would never hurt her, I love her. Well, she denies it completely. We all know that your suspect has been causing problems for my clients and for the whole town for that matter for quite some time. This time she just went too far. You worked for the older Mr. Kessler, right? I took care of Roger when he was a child and I helped raise him after his mother passed. There have been accusations that she was seeking revenge for something that happened to you. I'm sorry, I don't know what you're referring to. When did you learn about their relationship? He didn't tell me about her until... till our wedding night... and she was watching us. You didn't call the police? Roger said that she was harmless. You ever see that before? It was found with the body. Was there ever a time when he behaved inappropriately toward you? No. He was always very loving. He loved me. Thank you. Your daughter says that on the night her husband was killed that, uh, she was staying in Portland with you. Yes, that's correct. I drove to Portland to see our lawyer. Did anyone see her when she was with you? We met in my office, my assistant was gone for the day so... no. I stayed over with my mom. She came and made dinner and we watched the news and went to bed. Like normal. Is there anything else you want to tell us about Daphne's relationship with Roger? It's going to take a long time for her to recover from this. Thank you. I think we have what we need. We appreciate your help. Well, it seems pretty clear to me. You're joking, right? What percentage of murders are committed by the victims spouse? Susanna was his girlfriend before, pregnant with his kid, it's pretty much the same thing nowadays. Exactly. What does she get out of it? Revenge. Besides why would Daphne want to kill him? She gets everything she wants. You're giving up to easily. Just because she's black doesn't mean she's guilty. Fuck you, man. I did not say that. But you got to go to where the evidence takes you. I did it, Mama. For you. For us. ¶ Sleep ¶ ¶ So I can see you ¶ ¶ In my dreams ¶ ¶ So I can be with you ¶ ¶ In my dreams ¶ ¶ I ¶ ¶ I see you with me ¶ ¶ I'll walk away ¶ ¶ To the edge of the dream ¶ ¶ I see the sun ¶ ¶ Rising up from the sea ¶ ¶ A new day, a new day ¶ ¶ The world is afire we feed ¶ ¶ Command me ¶ ¶ Relieve me ¶ ¶ Believe in the power You've honed ¶ ¶ Sleep ¶ ¶ So I can see you ¶ ¶ In my dreams ¶ ¶ So I can be with you ¶ ¶ In my dreams ¶ ¶ I ¶ ¶ I see you with me ¶ ¶ Stay with me ¶ ¶ I want you ¶ ¶ I want you here with me ¶ ¶ Don't you see ¶ ¶ I need you, I need you ¶ ¶ Sleep ¶ ¶ So I can see you ¶ ¶ In my dreams ¶ ¶ So I can be with you ¶ ¶ In my dreams ¶ ¶ I ¶ ¶ I see you with me ¶
