[trance music] [trance music continues] [traffic] Hey, how you doing beautiful? [laughs] [laughs] Oh damn! Ohh! Turned down by a flamer. Man! Fuck this! [screeching tires] What are you doing? What are you going to say while playing "Hide the Salami"? [laughs] [inaudible] [screeching tires] Shit! Be careful... His purse could be used as a deadly weapon. [laughing] [kissing sounds] [laughing] Oh shit. -[deep breath] -Then what Stevie? You aren't going to wet yourself, are you? [Mark laughs] [huffs] [loud rock music] [fighting] [rock music continues] [siren] Hey! Who's that? His lawyer? His wife. I've reached my decision. [judge] Although only one of the young men actually took part in the assault, I hold both responsible. However, taking into consideration that there are no previous convictions, I'm not going to give either of you a prison sentence. Steven Mendoza, 200 hours of community service. Mark Gonzalez, 100 hours of community service. In an AIDS facility! [bangs gavel] [sighs] [upbeat music] [upbeat music continues] [music fades] [sighs] [deep breath] Hey how you doing? I'm here for the um... Um, I'm supposed to meet a Mrs. Bernard or something. -I don't know, I'm supposed to help out or something. -I'm Dr. Bernard. You must be Stevie? Alright, before we get things started I think there's a few things you need to know. Firstly, we don't wear uniforms because we are trying to give the impression of a home, not a hospital. Also, we have a very specialized clientele. In order to be admitted into this hospice, a doctor has to determine that a patient has... six months or less to live. So if a patient lives longer than six months do you take him out back and shoot him? I'd appreciate it greatly if you would supervise Stevie during his short stay with us. If it proves difficult, all the staff can pitch in and help. Alright... thank you. Well? What, if anything, are you capable of doing to help out or something? I don't know? Um... maybe clean both your broomsticks? If I had a guess at your qualifications, I'd say that there are a couple of things you can do. -OK. -Bathrooms or bedpan? [laughs] Yeah. How about door number three? -There isn't one Stevie. -Well I'll make one. Look, I'll refuse this shit and have the judge give me jail time instead. OK, look. I think we got off to a bad start. Hi, I'm Stevie. -I know that. -And you are... Supervising your community time. OK Ma'am, isn't there anything else I can do for the next 30 days besides cleaning toilets? [floor creaks] [knocks] [coughs] Um, to what do I owe this visit? Uh, I was just stopping by... the hospital. Oh, where are my manners? Please, have a seat. -So, do you go to school? -No. Work then? Ah, aren't we lucky. All that can wait. The important thing is to enjoy yourself while you're young. See the world. Have you seen the world? Actually... outside of the US I've only been to Australia. Some world-traveler, huh? [frightened gasp] [sighs] -I didn't mean to startle you. -No you didn't, it's just... I only had time to come in for a minute. I got to go. [piano music] [sighs] You know what I heard... yeah, exactly. [footsteps] I gotta go. Sorry, I don't think it... [sighs] ...went too well. [footsteps] [sighs] Is Carlos OK? I think we've gotten off to a bad start. My name is Sonya. You don't have to clean bedpans and I think it would be best if you didn't visit another patient. What else can you do? Well, I can clean up. You know mop, sweep, do the dishes. That was pretty much my last job. And I think I can handle just about any maintenance thing. You know, loose wiring, patching up holes in the wall. Stuff like that. Just about anything but painting. I hate painting! Should have told her I hated getting laid! [Will shouts] Close my fucking door. You trying to kill me with those God-damn fumes? -Sorry. -Sorry? What are you? Some kind of faggot? [Stevie] Nope. So what are you then? Why are you painting walls that don't need to be painted? Are you dumb or just stupid? Well this certainly narrows it down. You're obviously not a painter! And you're not a talker. And you say you're not a faggot. So, what the hell are you then? Are you good for anything besides using up the air on this planet? I say, keep chopping down the rainforest, we don't need the air the trees provide. We just need to kill off the dead wood, the people that are a waste of space on this planet. And we can start with you, what do you think? [laughs sarcastically] [laughing] Didn't mean to offend you boy. In desperate times such as these, a fella's got to do what he's got to do to keep himself amused. Yo? Yo Betty Boop? Sorry... Miss Boop, I was wondering if I could borrow... - What's your name boy? - Stevie. Can I borrow Stevie here? Staring at the walls of Cell Block 1-0-7 has made me a little stir-crazy, in case you couldn't tell, and if I don't talk to someone fairly quickly, I'll surely pop. So what do you say? Can Stevie here be the beneficiary of hearing my life story? -But what about the painting? -I'm not talking all day Boopsy. I could limit my life story to the time I've spent in this exciting establishment, and then all I'd need is three seconds. I'll give you 15 minutes. Your Highness is both generous and compassionate. Thou has put aside the rumors that though hast no heart. Come my Lordship, time is of the essence. [orchestral music] [sighs] [orchestral music continues] Well, Stevie... I said I'd be telling you my life story but, I've already heard it. So, how about you tell me yours. Actually, I think I've heard yours too. Grew up in a modest house with your parents. They fought some but mostly got along pretty darn good. They tried to keep you down on the ranch, but you managed to sew your wild oats anyway, and that pretty much takes up all your thoughts. How you gonna sow more oats? Well, now that we've finished that story what else can we talk about? How about politics? What do you think about Bosnia? Affirmative action? Nuclear weapons? [sighs] If your tongue's been cut out, I could get a chalkboard and some chalk. Uh, well who says you know how to write? A snappy comeback. Almost a witticism. I'm stunned. I'm impressed. I see you in a completely different light. So, does this off-the-cuff remark try to conceal the fact that you have no opinion? Or is it your opinion that we should all be opinionless? What is that? A toy. That's what I do. At least that's what I did. Now, it's just a hobby. That's what happens when you continue to do things that no longer make any money. The career becomes a hobby. So, with all that nuclear testing going on in Nevada, I've always been amazed that anyone would want to live there. Not that California's so great. There's probably a nuclear sub, from who knows what country, passing by our great city as we speak. It could be from one of those new Russian countries, one of the ones like... never could spell, can't pronounce and have no idea who the leader is. But thank God there's no nuclear threat! And you know what happens when the wind blows west? Radiation is carried all over California. And when I realized this, did I pack my bags and get the hell out? No. Actually... I think I went to the deli and ordered a pastrami sandwich. Uh, anyway... What kind of toy is that going to be? I'm trying to make a unicorn. Hopefully one that will fly. My father taught me how to make toys and I'm something of a prodigy, if I do say so myself. But there's always been one thing that I could never make... a toy that would fly. Even my paper aeroplanes nose-dived straight into the ground. So before I leave this cruel, gravitational world, I'm going to make something that will fly... Hello William! -I brought you a care package. -[Will] Oh! I'm sick of hearing him whine, whine, whine about the food here. Am I interrupting something? Well, I think our time has expired for today. If you keep Herr Kommandant waiting, you may not be able to come and visit again tomorrow. [soulful music] [sighs] [bottle breaks] [laughs] [soulful music continues] [bottle breaks] Hey, so um, how did it go today? [sighs] Alright, I guess. You know, you got a car and they gave you the closest hospital. Man, it takes me three buses to get to my fudge packers' clinic. Nah. Once I got there it wasn't so bad though. They all seemed kind of scared of me so they didn't boss me around so much. What about you? [sighs] I don't know. I mean when I showed up, the first thing I saw was this fine-ass freak. -You know what I'm saying? -Hmm-mmm. [laughs] And I thought this prison sentence is turning out to be pretty cool. Yeah. Then she opened her mouth and ruined everything. Man, I hate it when girls do that shit. You know, I was thinking about digging a tunnel... try to escape... -but then I met this dude... -And he asked if you wanted to be the mommy or the daddy? And you said you wanted to be the daddy... so he said "OK, get down on your knees and suck momma's dick." [laughs] Man, this guy's a trip. I mean, I don't understand half the shit he says... You know, it's kinda like... Remember when I had to go to traffic school and I got into that school -that hired comedians for teachers? -Oh yeah! They hired teachers from our high school, right? [laughs] Anyway, the guy's a trip. [soulful music] You know if you keep enjoying your work I'll have to give you another assignment? Don't worry I'm still hating it. I just figured I might as well try and get it done. And give yourself a little bit more time to talk to Will? -Yeah, I guess so. If you don't mind? -It's fine by me. [sweeping] We've caught one. [somber music] [plastic sheeting] [plastic sheeting continues] [zipper] [somber music continues] [Will] Have you ever considered what you'd like done with your body after you die? [sighs] I'd like to be buried, but I don't want a coffin. A coffin is a waste of money and a waste of a perfectly good tree that is supposed to grow, produce air, make treelings. Not be chopped down, nailed together and stuck into the ground... Just bury me as I came into this world. Hmm, in my birthday suit. I've always like the idea of being buried in my own land. But, since the only land I own is in this pot here... I'd settle for being buried in a park, but not in some stuffy cemetery surrounded by strangers who, if I knew in life, I probably wouldn't like. You know, I hate to tell you this Will, but I think it's totally illegal to be buried in a park. There you go again bringing realism into it. The whole idea of a coffin has always baffled me. I think of it as man's final attempt to overcome nature, be buried in a box so that yucky dirt doesn't get all over you. I think I'd rather be eaten by the bugs right away, than have it prolonged a few years while my coffin starts to fall apart... Do you think we can talk about something else? A little too morose for such a sunny day? Who the hell am I to take up a six-foot plot of land for the rest of eternity? That would make me more important in death than I ever was in life. And no-one ever goes to cemeteries anyway. Maybe my parents would visit a few times, possibly a friend or two might drop by, but after they died who would ever show up? Nobody! I say bury me then plant some trees over me or... build an ice-cream stand on top of me for all I care. [digging in pot plant] You know Will, to me you seem like you're in great health. Ha my boy, for that you can help yourself to another soda. [appreciative sigh] -Hey, you want one? -Ah, no... I have to watch my figure. [fridge closes] [sighs] [opens can] [Will] Care for some disinfectant? Have you ever noticed how people act when they drive? The wimpiest guys get in their cars and suddenly turn into Super Cock! The tattooed rebel... itching for a good fight. Flipping people off without a moment's hesitation. But the moment these people step out of their cars they turn into The Wimp again. They fucking cower as they walk down the street. Yes, cower. OK, maybe not cower. But if somebody bumps into them do you think they say, "hey fuck you, get out of my way". No, they say "excuse me" even if it's not their fault. I bet you're one of those drivers that flip people off every chance you get. Yeah but also in the street too. Oh OK, well then you're not as bad as I thought. [frustrated sigh] Has anything I said penetrated that virgin brain of yours? You haven't given five minutes' thought to why you're here, or what'll happen to you when you die. Well God, or Jesus, or Allah, or Mother Nature or whatever you want to call him, her or it, gave you something called a brain. Supposedly your brain is superior to all the other animals in this world. It seems a shame all you've learned to do with it is discover two different ways to crush a beer can and ten different ways to destroy your brain cells. I'm giving you a homework assignment. I want you to go home tonight and think about what you see yourself doing in ten years. And, if you think you'll be doing anything other than working a job you don't like, drinking beer and trying to get laid, I want you to write down how you plan to fulfill your goal. Until tomorrow... Too-da-loo! Hey Sonya I was wondering, you know I still got a little time left... is there anything else you'd like me to do? How about you do some filing so I can stare at you? -Sure! [laughs] Not a problem. -No really, you can go home a little early tonight Stevie and don't worry, I won't tell the Judge. OK but um, listen... you get off soon too, right? Well, how about we go grab a bite to eat? You know, nothing formal, just a friendly meal? Why are you asking me out now? I don't know? I mean we seem to be getting along pretty good... No, no, no. But why now? Because Stevie, you saw me bend over and that got your little hormones all revving. Relax man! I'm not asking you to marry me or anything. Look Stevie... we have to be together for a certain amount of time... and I told myself I may as well try and be civil, but it's nothing... absolutely nothing more than that. Alright. Forget it. Later. [rap music] [sighs] [rap music continues] What's up? [Stevie] Hey! [guitar music] How's jail time going man? It's alright. How about you? [shouts] It fucking sucks! [laughs] -What are you doing, man? -Just some shit. [sighs] What kind of shit? Uh, homework. [strums guitar] You maybe want to do something later? -Maybe. -We can get a couple of beers or something. Uh, I don't think so. I'm kind of busy with this. Alright maybe tomorrow then huh? Yeah... tomorrow... [Mark] Alright then. Later. [Stevie] Later. [phone rings] -Hello? -Hi Stevie, it's Will. Now I know I'm crossing the patient-volunteer boundary, and you know I wouldn't call if it weren't a dire necessity and you can tell me to stop apologizing any time now... I don't mind you calling. What's up? Glue. -Excuse me? -I'm almost done with my project but I've run out of glue and no-one around here will go and get me any. -[sighs] Alright. -Oh and there's one other thing, you're not allowed in the building at this hour so you'll have to take the side entrance. -[Stevie] Side entrance? [falling bag] Shit! [sighs] [opening window] Have you got the letters of transit? Here, I kinda dropped it on the way up but I'm sure it's alright. I don't suppose you could go back and get some more? Oh well, uh... no matter. [Stevie] Hey... what the... It was the wrong kind anyway... not strong enough. I appreciate your effort though. But, now that you're here there is something I really would like to talk about, so... have a seat. Well I'm sure that you've noticed that I have my share of opinions... -No! You? -But there is one thing that I have virtually no opinion on. -What? Whether you have a conscience? -Lighten up Stevie! I'm talking about heaven... I'm not sure if I believe one exists or not. Well, I wouldn't worry about it. I'm not worried about getting in, I'm worried about being bored to death once I get in. Well, maybe you can amuse yourself by sending God on useless errands. For instance, will there be movies and books? Hopefully I've got nothing to worry about and it'll have the biggest library in the whole galaxy. I could read the latest Hemingway novels, the ones he wrote after he died. Or, maybe go to the theater... and see what Shakespeare's written lately. That's the spirit. But, if there are movies and plays and books, can you imagine how badly God would censor them. More than likely I'd spend the rest of eternity watching Bob Hope flicks. And then you'd realize you were in hell. Touché! I should get you upset more often, it seems to have stirred your senses. And another thing, do you think they allow dating up there? Or is heaven a place where there is no longer any sex? No longer any need for entertainment such a movies... just an endless flow of spiritual harmony, bliss and enlightenment. Break time over! You need to stop this lazing around and get back to your momma's house and finish up that little homework assignment. [claps hands] [moving bowl] [vomiting] [coughing] [panting] [moving sick bowl] [still panting] Yo! What's happening partner? I've got my homework. [Will still panting] -You alright Will? -Huh? Ahh... I might look like I'm in hell, but I feel... oh... like I'm in purgatory. Before our friendship goes any further I need to know what it is you've done. -You mean about the homework? -To get in here! What crime against humanity did you commit that forced you to squander your time with a person such as myself. [sighs] I kinda got in this fight... Must have been a pretty bad fight. No, it weren't that bad. [Will coughs] And why did you kind of get into a fight? [clicks fingers] Because he was gay... I thought. You can go now. [shouts] Go! -[Sonya] What's going on? -Nothing. -Well, is Will OK? -Uh, yeah. He just got a little pissed off. What did you do? Nothing! You know not everything that happens around here is my fault. Oh, it's not? [frustrated sigh] [gentle music] [classical music] OK, look... I don't know what it is that I have against gays... I mean, I used to never even trip off them... gays that is. [classical music continues] Um... a few years ago I had this summer job where we went around from store to store, handing out these free pamphlet things... and one day I stupidly walked into this crowded gay bar, and I asked the bartender if I could leave some pamphlets on the counter... and this bartender dude says all sexually that no I can't leave them on the counter, but I can leave them in the back room. Now here I am, some skinny little 15 year old, and he wants me to go in the back room with him. And he had this strange look in his eyes that... scared me to death. So I pushed my way through the crowd and took off. I think ever since that day, I've always had some kind of hatred towards gays. [classical music continues] These are for you to look at when you get tired of staring at the walls here in Cell Block 1-0-7. This is for you to wear when the winds are blowing west. -Radiation from the... -Yeah, I get it. Thank you. Well... I guess I'll be going. I got a lot of painting to catch up on. Actually... maybe I can start painting right here. Shouldn't need more than a few coats. And I don't think the smell will be that bad. As a matter of fact, in a few weeks there'll hardly be any smell at all. This... is me in my prime. Mmm, very studly. And this one was taken many years back. As you can see, I hadn't quite mastered the jungle gym. [laughs] Well I hope your parents had insurance. Speaking of which... here are my illustrious parents. I hadn't informed them I was gay until I found out I had AIDS. I wasn't sure which piece of news would be more devastating, the fact that I was gay, or the fact that I was dying. But since they have yet to visit I'm fairly certain of the answer. [turns page] And these... are some of my conquests. [laughs] They look like nice guys. Girlfriend, is there something you should be telling me? Hey, who's she? I had girlfriends too... once upon a time. I always had an advantage when it came to getting women. Huh, and what's that? I'm scared to ask. I was completely irresistible to the feminine species, because I was so easy to talk to. Just... one of the girls. Here's another one who finds me irresistible, right Boopsy? [Stevie laughs] [turns page] -Here's your meds. -A nurse usually brings them. Are you using this med-thing as an excuse to come in here to make sure we're not fighting? Or couldn't you survive another moment without sneaking a peak at my incredible physique? [instrumental ♪"yesterday" ♪ Will these steroids really make me run faster coach? Thirsty? [Stevie mumbles] How about you, Kommandant? A pleasure as always. [footsteps] Deep down you've got quite the crush, huh? Huh? For her? No way! Uh-huh! I think it's time for lecture number 42... "Sexual partners and the art of obtaining one" or, in your case... "How to get a girl whose IQ is larger than her breast size". I've often thought about writing a book on the subject, but that just seems to be one more thing we never have time for. Chapter One states, "You must never approach a potential partner... sorry... an immature 16 year old when you're with a group of friends". I'd never gotten anywhere when I was with friends and I'm sure you haven't either. Once in 200 times doesn't count. Sample question number one, "when a young lady passes, what do you do?" I know your answer. You eye her like a wolf and, if she eyed you back which she won't, you pounce on her. Chapter One states you must never, never, never approach a young lady first. Let her notice you. Let her check you out. Then, as she passes you look at her and smile and your smile is not one of a wolf, but one that shows that you are the sweetest most loving human being on the face of the planet. And if she eyes you back, you'd better have the cojones to walk up and talk with her. That's it? No, that's Chapter One. I don't if you've ever seen a book, but there's usually more than one chapter. Chapter Two states you must ask lots of questions, get a woman talking about herself and you'll be in her pants before dinner. Yeah, but what if she doesn't want to talk about herself? Then she's probably not worth talking to unless you're into unadulterated carnal sex which I'm sure you're much too mature for. What else does your book have in it? Oh, there's infinitely more but I can only cram so much into your tiny skull at one time. [Stevie] Hello. Yes? I was just stopping by to say hi. So, how're you doing? Fine. Catching up with some paperwork? Trying to... Stevie, what is it I can help you with? Nothing. Um, I was just seeing how you're doing. So, what else do you do when you're not working? I go to school, three nights a week at San Francisco State. [quiet music] What's your major? Liberal Studies. Liberal Studies... Liberal Studies. What can you do with that? I think I'd like to teach. I'm not sure if I'd like to teach children or at the adult level but I still have a couple of years to figure that out. But right now, Stevie, I really have to get back to work. -Okay. -Okay. [Stevie] So what are you working on? I really have to get back to work. Okay. [Stevie] What's in Chapter Three? It is time for the moment of truth. My only fear is this puppy will fly so far, we'll never be able to find it. [uneven mechanical sounds] Well, let's see. Back to things of real importance. Girl trouble. Chapter Three states that you must prove yourself to be the sensitive kind. How do I pull that off? Open yourself up to her. Reveal some hidden part of yourself. Let her in on something personal. - Like what? - You tell me. [sighs] I don't know. Remember when you told me about the incident with the gay bartender? I didn't necessarily agree with your take on the event but the fact that you tried to understand your feelings was beautiful. Yes, uhuh. I'll look up that information and get back to you. [Sonya] Okay, thank you. Bye-bye. I thought you went home already. No, I was just reflecting. [phone rings] Excuse me. [Sonya] Wilkes hospice? Oh, that'd be great! You can come visit him any time you'd like. Sure! Okay, bye-bye. I need to see the files for Alex O'Neill. [shuffling through files] -What is it I can help you with, Stevie? -I can wait. [shuffling through files] Thank you very much. I just wanted to tell you something. It's not all that important or anything. It's just that... When I was a kid I used to have this-- Hey Sonya. Any messages? No, sorry. I swear if his girlfriend doesn't call every 10 minutes, he thinks something's wrong. OK, what were you saying? Oh, just that I had this neighbor that nobody liked, all right? She was this old lady and everyone thought of her as some kind of witch. Hey! Well, anyway, my neighbor, she never talked to anyone, right? And one day when me and a couple of buddies were playing football in the street, the ball got thrown into her front yard. - I went to get it-- - Thanks, Sonya. Good luck. Well, I didn't want to go near the house. It kinda gave me the creeps, you know what I'm saying? [sighs] But I had to, so... Just as I'm reaching for the ball, the old lady appears. [gasps] I thought she was going to bite me or something but she said, "I hope one day I'll see you playing for the 49ers." And she said it so sweetly, you know? I realized all those rumors about her being a witch were just a bunch of bullsh-- Well, they weren't true. She died a couple weeks later. [sighs] I think I was the only one on my block to know that she was actually a very sweet old lady. [soft music] [sniff] [soft music continues] I'll make you a deal, Stevie. If you stop telling me these stories and asking me questions and allow me to work maybe afterward we can go get a bite to eat. After work? I know of a place we can go. Just a friendly meal, right? [exciting upbeat music] [Billy] Here you are, gorgeous. How's everything going, Billy? Well, my work is killing me. It takes them about two hours to slice a bag of carrots. So who's this? Your little cousin? [Sonya] No, this is my friend Stevie. Stevie, Billy. A pleasure, I'm sure. Huh? [Billy and Sonya laughing] So, what else can I get you? Um, how about a bran muffin and a shot of your wheat-grass. [Billy] You too, huh? No, thanks. [Billy] I'll tell you what, I'll make you one on the house. Ooh, great. Great! [upbeat music continues] [Sonya] I used to feel the same way as you, but I got so tired of Billy pestering me all the time that I just gave in. [upbeat music continues] Hey, what is this? Carrot and spinach and I have them throw in a little protein powder. [upbeat music continues] Here you go, fresh from my garden. [Sonya] Thanks, Billy. [upbeat music continues] [coughs] Oh, hey, it's kind of an acquired taste, huh? You have to drink about five or six of them to get used to it. Hey, line them up! You know what, Stevie? I like you. I think I'll kill you last! [laughs] Hey, come on with a cappuccino already, huh? I've shown them ten times how to make a cup of coffee. What could be so difficult? So, now that you've had it, do you feel any extra energy? I feel an upset stomach. Anyway, so how come you work at the hospice? I mean, it seems to me like you get kind of depressed in knowing everyone you're working with is going to die. I'll be sure to tell Will you said that. You know what I mean. So... Well, why do you work there? I mean, did you want to, or was it the only job you could get? [quiet music] My, uhh... My older sister's gay. She... She came out of the closet when I was 16. When she told me my mature response was to just run right out of the house. I'm so stupid. [soft sad music] I didn't come home for two days. And when I returned I didn't apologize. I only came home because I had stayed out in the cold the night before and I couldn't bear to do it a second night. I didn't realize how much I was hurting her until... One morning I woke up and she was gone. She just moved out. [soft sad music continues] She didn't tell anybody where she was going. I... I ended up later finding out through a friend where she was living. And I begged her to forgive me which she did immediately. But, um... I don't think... You see... I haven't forgiven myself. [sad music continues] How're you doing, beautiful? [soft music] Son, we all have things in our past that we're not too proud of. Stevie? Hey, what's going on, Mark? How much? Oh, Sonya, this is Mark. What are you doing here, man? Just having a juice. And hey, it looks kinda awful but you know it's actually pretty good. You want some? So, we're going to get together tonight or what? No. No, I mean, uh... I don't know. Maybe. So, hey, how's your hospital time going? Well, today was my last day! And to celebrate they had me scrub the garbage cans down the back. Most of the times I was just fucking around with the hose, you know? Spraying the cars that went by. Sounds exciting. Yeah, well. I'm gonna get going. All right. Um, I'll give you a buzz later. Yeah. Later. Later. Stevie, we all have stuff in our past that we're not too proud of. I can... contain my emotions during the day even hide them from myself but night proves me a liar. I can't remember the last time I had a decent night of sleep. I try reading or distracting myself with a movie and sometimes I'm lucky enough to fall asleep while I'm watching. But my mind wakes me in a few hours and gives me a reality check. I lie awake for hours oddly depressed. [tender music] It's not just my ailment that keeps me awake, mind you. What else? Love, sex, flesh on flesh, human contact. Those goldfish just don't cut it. And knowing that I'll never have sex again. My memories, and I have quite a few have at times kept me content. Especially when I remember someone that I've completely forgotten about. It's like reliving the experience. Almost. [tender music continues] Mmm, I remember the night like the Fruit Loop. Club-hopping. I used to walk into a nightclub feeling like I own the place the dim colored lights, the pumping music flirting my little ass off. You went to clubs. I thought you'd be too mature to go looking for unadulterated carnal sex. That is a fringe benefit of being on one's death bed. I have suddenly become a man of wisdom, a man of great morals one deserved of respect. Even if I was nothing but a tail-chaser. On those occasions when I'd meet someone and we'd dance... It's kind of like your first kiss. You never know how the person's going to respond to you on the dance floor. Will they keep you at a distance? Will they dance close so they'd brush up against you? Will they turn around and stick their butt in your groin? I was almost always surprised by my partner's responses and that element of not knowing was so fucking thrilling. [tender music continues] And if it weren't for the nightclubs I wouldn't be where I am today. If it just weren't for the damned night my loneliness wouldn't be so bad. [sighs] Sometimes I dread the night so much I turn on all the lights and try to stay awake as long as I can. I'd even beat the night a couple of times, but not sleeping just turning myself into a zombie of late-night TV. But the night always wins in the long run. The night always wins. [sighs] [doorbell rings] [door opens] - Yes? - How're you doing? Um... My name's Stevie. I work with, Will... I'm a friend of your son, Will. Will hasn't asked me to come or anything. It's just, he's talked about you guys sometimes. I think he'd really like you to come visit. I appreciate your concern. Wait, wait, wait, Mr. Hawthorne, he needs help with a toy. Will's trying to make this unicorn and he can't get it to fly. [door closing] [Latin dance music] [knocking on door] Hey Stevie. Are you going to church? Well, I figured there was one place you never went. [door closing] And so it is. [loud dance music] So, you want a beer or something? No, I don't drink. No? Oh, I love this song. ♪ Oh baby, don't go away ♪ So, I don't dance. So, then it's time you do. [romantic music] [romantic music continues] Relax, Stevie. ♪ Please, don't go away ♪ Don't worry about the crowd. [romantic music continues] [romantic music continues] [romantic music continues] Remember me? I'm sorry, Stevie. I guess I kinda got lost in the music. That's cool. You know, I never would have thought the girl behind the desk could dance like that. And I'm just getting warmed up. ♪ Makes me stop, makes me think How your love turns me on ♪ ♪ Ooh, baby. Every time ♪ Two Cokes, please. Oh, I left my money in the coat check. One Coke, please. That's cool. Don't worry, I'll get it. [dance music continues] That'll be three dollars, please. [dance music continues] There you go. Thank you. Thanks. [dance music continues] I bet I can point out the guys who came with their girlfriends from the guys who just met a girl here. See, the guys who came with their girlfriends are much more laid back. Just look at them. They're not dancing, they're just checking out other girls. And the guys who just met a girl here are all over them hanging on the girl's every word buying them drinks, always trying to make them laugh. See how close they can get to them on the dance floor. [music continues] Oh God, what if this... What if this is all a metaphor of marriage? Everything being roses at first. But then the rose wilts. And the petals fall off. And all you're left with is a stem. And a few thorns that you never even knew were there. [music continues] I think I need a dance. Well, I don't want to. That way, if we ever go to a club again and I don't want to dance you won't be able to say I'm turning into a thorny stem. Because you already are one? [music continues] [music continues] Thanks for a wonderful night, Stevie. [quiet music] It's getting late, I'd better be getting in. We both have to be at the hospice in a few hours. [quiet music continues] Well... Goodnight. Son, um... See you in a few hours. [quiet music continues] When's the last time you've done this? Done what? Been out on a date and not made a move. Not for a long time... if ever. [romantic music] I'd get out of here before I ruin the night and get myself slapped. [romantic music continues] [Sonya] Oh, and by the way... You wouldn't have gotten slapped. [door closing] [upbeat music] [upbeat music continues] Oh, my, my! Look what the cat dragged in. So, I take it your date went pretty well, then? Who told you I had a date? Don't play coy with me, young man. You should know by now there are no secrets in here. So tell me. Did you kiss her? Did you kiss her twice? Did you see what color panties she wore? Details, Stevie! I need details! Gentlemen don't kiss and tell. Gentlemen, are we now? That means you didn't get a kiss goodnight. Not to worry. Chapter Four states it is usually better in the long run if you don't do anything in the short run. What is with the two of you? Girlfriend, wouldn't you like to know? Well. I see my flaming buoyancy no longer embarrasses you to the point of having to leave the room. So, the only thing left is for us to be friends. Hi, I'm James. Stevie. [Will] Oh, now isn't that precious. [chuckling] Ohhh. You are both in for a special treat. I've made a few minor adjustments. And it is now time to demonstrate the ultimate flying machine! [uneven mechanical sounds] [Will's father] Let's have a look. Good workmanship. [uneven mechanical sound] Mmm, I think with a longer string we should be able to get this up and running. That should about do it. [uplifting music] [whirring sound] [inspirational music] Hey girls. [upbeat music] [ominous dramatic music] What happened to Carlos? Did he move out of his room? Carlos died Stevie. I'm sorry. I thought you knew. [door closing] It's not your fault, Stevie. Carlos was very sick. It's Ok. It's Ok. [sighing deeply and sobs] You know... The only thing I keep thinking about is the look on his face when I left. I was probably one of his last visitors. And I treated him like shit. [sobbing] Well, goodbye, son. The boy has become a man. And I don't mean in a sexual sense. You have come of age. No longer are you some foul-mouthed brain-dead teenager. You have developed into a caring, inquisitive young man. From this day forward, you shall no longer be called Stevie. From now on, you shall be known as Steven. Steven. You know, I never liked the sound of that before. But from this day forth I think I shall hear it in a different light. Don't get carried away on me, Steven. If I act grandiose, it's fairly amusing. If we both act grandiose, we sound like babbling idiots. Well, I guess this young man has much to learn, huh? Mmm, who doesn't? Next. Hi, I'd like to register for next semester. OK, you need to fill out these forms, bring them back to me and then you have to go upstairs and take the placement tests. Next. The tests aren't pass or fail they're just to determine what level you should start at. Thanks. So how'd it go? Put it this way. I think all my classmates will be foreign students who don't speak any English. [laughing together] No, I'm kidding. Come on, let's get out of here. [exciting music] Oh, oh, look at that. Look at that. Seeing something? Hey! Hey, how's it going? [laughing] Man, do you expect to get anywhere with a line like that? [door opening] [door closing] [quiet music] I always thought when death crept closer that other things would lose their importance Prejudice Poli-tricks... World atrocities... I thought I would see that none of it was of real significance. That life was the only thing of consequence. But it seems so vivid. It matters more than ever, because I've used up my chance to do anything about them. It might seem absurd, but my goal when I died was to have two lines on my tombstone. But not everyone deserves a second line. A line that tells of their accomplishments. One that proves, after all, it's written in stone that you served a purpose on this planet. But I haven't eliminated nuclear weapons, haven't brought about world peace, haven't organized a relief fund to end world hunger, I've made a couple of toys that are not that original. I always wanted that second line. Now I know I'll never have it. You know, Will... sometimes you can be so full of shit. I mean you have a second line. You made toys. And you've also... -You've made a difference in my life. -[Will] Wait. Is there a soap opera on? Well, you have. I mean... Think I would have enrolled in school? You're killing me. "Would have" enrolled in school, not "would've" enrolled in. You've mangled the English language time and time again. I'd die happy if just once you spoke correctly. You think I would have Sonya as my girlfriend? Girlfriend, is she now? And it's "do you think I would have Sonya as my girlfriend?" You never speak in a complete sentence. It's always these choppy, unintelligible improper sentences. [quiet music continues] Cat got your tongue? Yes, I guess I am partially responsible for the upgrading of your once-miserable life. [coughs] So, does this mean you'll no longer participate in another fag-bashing? Well, what do you know? In one fell swoop I've managed to end prejudice and create world peace. I guess a "thank you" is in order. [quiet music continues] [sighs] Thank you, Will. You've taught me a lot and made me a much better person. I think I can now live a much fuller, enriching life. Don't mention it. And now leave me so I can catch up on my beauty rest. [quiet music continues] Mmm. I think for the first time in a long time I'm going to get a good night's sleep. It'll disprove one of my theories. But what the hell. The night doesn't always win. [sad saxophone music] [Stevie] I was able to convince his parents to bury Will next to a tree in their back yard. It's slightly against the law. But so was Will's sexual preference in 37 states. I wasn't able to persuade them into forgetting about the coffin. [sad music continues] You see, Will would say that his coffin was the waste of a perfectly good tree. Maybe I can plant a tree out here to make up for it. Or maybe I'll plant one when I have my own back yard. Who knows? Maybe I'll never have a back yard and forget all about Will. But I prefer to think that I'll remember to plant that tree. And maybe, when the time comes I'll ask to be buried next to that tree. [sad music continues]
