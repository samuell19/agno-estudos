Hello. Is Father Quirós here? Is he dead? You made a vow of silence? Christ! For how long? Thanks. Father Quirós? Good morning. Good morning. Are you here to confess? -No, I came for something else. -Come in and sit down. How can I help you? I need a baptismal certificate. Were you baptized here? Yes, by you. I also had my First Communion here. Do you remember when you got baptized? September of '78. Then the record should be here. In the books. What's your name, son? Tamayo. Gonzalo Tamayo. The son of Ernesto Tamayo... and Carmen Santamarina? Yes. Why do you need a baptismal certificate? To apostatize. Dear Javi, I have finally begun the proceedings. I went by the church to get the baptismal certificate. Did you know Father Quirós is still wearing the red ring? I remembered that when we kissed his hand, we always tried to see our reflection on the ring's stone. Do you think we were looking for a divine sign? I really miss those days when you lived in Madrid, you bastard. I've got so much to tell you. Since I've decided to apostatize, lots of things are happening that I can't control. Look, the other morning I was asleep in bed... -Hi. -Hello. What's up? -Poor Carlos! -What about me? Don't annoy me, too. He's so immature! -So, it's over? -I don't know. And I got the apartment. -That's good news. -Yeah, great. The perfect moment to doubt everything. Hey, Pilar, can you put that paper back on the floor? It's a reminder. I have to re-do two invoices for my father. If that's not there, I won't remember. Were you asleep? No, don't worry. I have to go to work. Try to sleep, my love. There's some food in the fridge that grandma made, if you're hungry. -All right. -OK. Yes? -Gonzalo? -Hello, mother. -Are you awake? -Yes, I am. -Is anyone with you? -No, I'm alone. You sound weird. Are you sick? It's just very early. -I'll call you later. -OK, bye. It was impossible not to desire my cousin. Even as a child, she was beautiful. I was ashamed to tell you that one day I couldn't control myself and asked my grandmother for permission to marry her. I lied and said the Pope had to marry us, for it not to be a sin. So, I needed her authorization. -"Will you let us, grandma?" -"Of course, sweetheart." -Hello, Gonza. -Hello, Antonio. Did you know Galván and Toti were expelled from class? Why? For doing that tickling thing in class. We've talked about that, haven't we? Yes, it's something you do in private. One day I did it eight times, and a friend, eleven. Eleven times? No way. Shall we start with your homework, or do you want to read? Let's read. Start here. From "Moriel". Do you know if women are ticklish, too? Sure, in their own way. And my mother? Yes. -Did she make cookies? -Yes. Thanks. How do you know? -Know what? -About my mother being ticklish. I don't, I just guess so. Why do you ask? I don't know. -What did you hear? -Nothing. Carry on. "Moriel was a bit depressed. He no longer had the strength to face misfortunes, and his scorn for events slowly turned into an almost superstitious terror that grew with each new blow he received. The corruption was invincible, and it seemed easier to destroy that generation than to convince it." -Gonzalo? -Yes. -I'm Bishop Jorge. Good morning. -Good morning. The beadle told me you want to apostatize. Yes. I have the application and the baptismal certificate. -And are you in hurry? -Now? No, not particularly. Traditionally apostasy was carried out by an act. A symbolic act. The person who wanted to apostatize stated his decision to abandon the Catholic faith in front of the altar. Then, he had to leave the church walking backwards while he looked at the altar. That's lovely. -Take one. -No, thanks, I don't... So, tell me, why do you want to do this? -There are lots of reasons. -You can tell me what's going on. My parents betrayed me. I was not allowed to choose. -My baptism was involuntary. -Naturally, so was mine. The Catholic education I received did me no good. Many of the things they taught me have been counter-productive. What things? Why was the spirituality you learned counter-productive? Well, it was never about spirituality. It was more a matter of scaring us with superstitions, of control as opposed to reasons. And then there are the dogmas, the monotheism, the idea that things happen in a determined way. It seems like an unnatural way of conceiving the world, which leaves me no space. There are other things, like, if God orders you to be poor, how do you end up being rich? We all have what we've been given, son. Your doubts have led you to bitterness. That's very normal. Great men of faith have doubted. It's good that you're curious, but you forget that hatred is an illness cured by words. As St. Ignatius said: "In dubiis non est agendum." -In cases of doubt, do not act. -Do not act. Doubt, -desolation... -Yes, I understand. But I don't know how to believe in any of that. Much less in a vengeful, suspicious God. Gonzalo, let me advise you. You'll be a good Christian. St. Augustine was just like you. And God's inspiration converted him into one of the Fathers of our Church. You, too, will hear the Lord's voice and be converted. You will love what you now hate. You will love the nobles, protectors of the industries and an example of good customs. You will love the kings, images of God on earth who enforce the law. And the friars, poor, humble creatures who teach good doctrines and comfort the afflicted. If it were as you say, Father, and their aim wasn't to exploit people, I would love them. But it doesn't seem right to continue being a part of something with which I don't identify. Do you think I feel totally represented by the Pope? Do you feel represented by the president? -By the king? -No, not at all. And do you stop being Spanish because of that? I doubt it. So, tell me. By what do you feel represented? -By myself. -Of course. And tell me, have you told your mother? My mother? No, she still doesn't know. I see. And you want to continue with the process? Yes, I want to be erased from the baptismal records and from any other record there is. Don't worry, Gonzalo. We'll make a note in the book. Great. And then what? You have to wait for the letter from the archbishopric. But can't you...? No, no, you submit the documentation, and we'll send the letter to the address you give us. You start the process over there. Hello... How much? Thank you. FAIL Professor? Professor! Look, Tamayo, philosophizing isn't forcing the classics to say whatever you want. There are absolute truths! Then, why think? For the Greeks, there was only one sin: excess, hubris. Human beings must accept that mediocrity is their natural condition. Isn't there always a hidden meaning in things? And to discuss that in depth I've invited you to attend my class again, next year, as you know. "Idols of the cave." "Great is the audacity of ignorance." -Hi. -Hello. Could I have a couple of steaks? Yes, would you like veal or aged beef? -Veal. -Veal. How would you like them, thin or thick? -Thin. -Thin. -Hello, Maite. -Hello. Who'll open it? Will you open it, please? I can't find my keys. -Thanks. -You're welcome. Did you see that Antonio's grades have improved? Yes, he's concentrating more. It's thanks to you, Gonzalo. Has he mentioned a girl? Why? No, he had a piece of paper and wouldn't tell me what it was. I tried to find out, but I think he was embarrassed. -He probably likes some girl. -You think so? Yes, he's growing up. Well, something's going on. Excuse me, Curly. The toilet isn't working. -I'll be right there. -Bye. -Did you try that trick? -Yes, but it didn't work. -I had to shut the water off. -OK. I'll fix it. -Where were you? -Working. And I got some steaks for dinner. -I wanted to talk to you. -Any word from Carlos? No. What is this? Why do you need a baptismal certificate? -Are you getting married? -No! I'm going to apostatize. I don't want to be included in their statistics, you know? Look, finish school, finish something. Forget that nonsense. It isn't nonsense. They've got our names. And they're using us. Want to join me? You'll give up at the first hurdle. You know what's nonsense? Buying an apartment you can't afford and blackmailing some guy named Carlos, so you can pay for it and eat. Thanks, Curly. In the end, you'll be the of those girls who wants to get pregnant, have a white wedding, and take the kids to a Catholic school. What are you doing? You know you can stay as long as you want. Pilar... You know what? You're still a cruel boy. Antonio? Hello. I need some definitions. Come in. -I'm going to put on some music. -All right. -Is that crying girl your cousin? -Yes. Why was she crying? She was angry with me. I can't find "monumental". Why don't you look for "monument"? Why was your cousin angry? Why don't you take the dictionary and do your work at home? All right. Bye. I couldn't forget what my cousin had said. You remember José Luis? He smelled odd, like stale piss. What I did to him was really cruel. I couldn't stand José Luis. The dickhead was manipulated by his mother, a very nosy woman. One day, just so he'd leave me alone, I got him in the school yard and punched him in the stomach. Then I rubbed his face with some bread we pissed on. He was so scared, he did nothing to defend himself. He just kept looking at me. After a while I let him go. The bastard told his mother that evening. They expelled me and made me flunk the grade. The psychologist made light of my thefts and misdeeds. He said I was looking for the attention I didn't get at home. Hello. It's Tamayo. LAWYER Hello. Tell your father it's the last time I'll do this. Tell dad I've left this here. -You have to separate these, too. -More envelopes? I told dad I don't want to do this anymore. Gonza, I don't understand. It was the last exam. What happened? Didn't you study? -Of course I did, mom. -Well, then? It seems your son is still half stupid. Don't say that. Well, I'll pass next year, or the year after that. You said that last year, and the year before. I'm leaving, OK? You don't want to stay for lunch? Your sister's coming with the baby. I can't. Give them a kiss for me. -Hi. -Hello. Mom says I should only use the school dictionary, or else it's an abuse. I gave it to him. -I told her that. -Yeah, OK. We'll let you be. Bye. Bye. "Regarding your request, in accordance with Article 302, you are invited to the archbishopric to re-evaluate your decision." Hi, Gonza. "If the applicant is firmly determined to renounce his religious faith, there will be an audience prior to the process, so that he may present all documentation and the allegations he sees fit." I've told them everything. What do these people want? Who? Write down what I say. "Now I understand the excess and violence that accompany the first popular revolts, and certain crimes that reason cannot justify now make sense." Wait... "And I understand the passion of countless beings abused by the tyranny of centuries." Why are they shocked when the rope breaks, after they have stretched it so much, not understanding that every resistance has its limit and every tyranny finally has its terrible day? I don't understand anything. Nor do I. We'll do this another day. Bishop Jorge will be busy all day. -Can he see me? -Bishop Jorge left you a message. Well, what did he say? A baptismal record doesn't necessarily have to do with your current beliefs or attendance at worship. -So don't worry. -Don't worry? Tell him that's not what we agreed, OK? OK? Apostate Spain: Room 107 III Nudist Conference: Room 109 Next, let's vote for a representative. We have to vote. Come on. Let's vote now and get this done with. I insist we must attack on all fronts. If we do it through the Data Protection Agency, we won't achieve much, but at least the Church officials will have to answer us. -But we won't achieve anything that way. -We know that. We have to continue with the demonstrations. It's the only way to get people to rise. Yes, there are more of us, since we became active. But I think if we have someone there as our official representative and they're present during the whole procedure, we're going to get a better idea of what's going on. So, we'll continue with the demonstrations in the meantime. Now, about the Atheist procession. David and the treasurer have hired the bus. Gema and Araújo are forming a group to make some banners. The banners are ready. Everyone join in. The more we are, the sooner we can have a few beers. We'll split the cost of the gas. It's about 5 euros each. Hey! What's wrong? Nothing. Going to the village the other day, I had that feeling of discomfort I get every so often. I remembered that, as a child, my mother made me lie to the family because she was ashamed that I kept flunking a grade. Everyone thought I got good grades. Even my psychologist was fooled and noted my progress. At home, that was seen as a triumph. One day it was even celebrated with pancakes. The cake! Gonzalo! Dessert! Do you like that? Do you? Let's see what else there is. The little birds, the bull, look at them. Look, this was our room, when we were kids. Do you like it? Wow, look at all this crap. -Gonzalo, you won't get any dessert! -Coming! Eight or ten openings are not the same as two or three. The chances are greater. But that's not the case. I understand. -Is Pilar interested? -She has her own plans, but she has to pay her apartment. They're so strong and intelligent. Hey, Ernesto, they all graduated with honors. Our kids will get what they want. But you need more than that for the civil service exams. Don't fool yourself. That's not the only important thing to pass the exam. Is the exam really that hard? No, it's just as hard as all the other exams. Pilar, cheer up your grandfather. It's his party. Grandpa, will I sing for you? Sing for him. Poor old Wimpy is sick What will we give him? Poor old Wimpy is sick What will we give him? A beating with a stick And we'll kill him A beating with a stick And we'll kill him Poor old Wimpy Is really is a wimp He touches his thingy Cuz it's all limp He pokes it with his finger It's no use, he gives a sigh Poor old Wimpy He wants to die Poor old Wimpy is sick What will we give him? Poor old Wimpy is sick What will we give him? Snail water And he'll get better Snail water And he'll get better What's wrong? The dogs. What do you mean, Curly? Those dogs... I think it is outrageous that you won't begin the process until the applicant locates a record that is in your possession. I believe the only reason for this is to complicate the process, to encourage a greater number of people to give up. To justify your refusal to cancel the record, you claim that the baptismal book isn't a database. With regards to this, I wish to say that Bishop Jorge, on my visit to the archbishopric, mentioned the possibility of writing my decision in the baptismal book. -Is this seat taken? -No, you can sit down. So, what you call "a registry that records a historical fact" is a real database that can be updated. Then you say you have an apostolic mission... -Can you put this up there for me? -This mission you speak of, imposed by a supernatural being of debatable existence, involves a legal apparatus compiled in the Code of Canonical Law. This code should not transcend the constitutional text of a declared lay state. In short, my baptism incorporates me into a system of beliefs I don't share and also subordinates me to a parallel legal system. I am only subject to the constitutional legal system, which supports my right to freely choose my belief. Let me just say that my adscription to the Catholic Church was done without my consultation. I would never support the institution's basic precepts because they are exclusive and patriarchal, and everyone knows of the institution's repeated involvement with bloody totalitarian regimes, which grant it great privileges. Finally, in regards to your claim that my baptismal certificate does not necessarily correspond to my current beliefs, I see that the number of affiliates benefits you more, and therefore you prioritize high numbers instead of valuing the quality of the affiliates. Obviously, coherence is not one of your main concerns as you continue to defend a register with non-believers, despite the clear objection declared by many of them. Your position clashes with my coherence of which I am proud, proven by the fact that I am addressing you yet again in what is an irritating process. Therefore, I ask you to please accept my demand and cancel all the data you have on me, as it constitutes a record of the violation of my freedom. Finally, I want to say to this tribunal that war has been declared. Gonzalo Tamayo? Yes. -Hello, Gonzalo. -Hello, mom. Well, I made a stew. Heat it up, if you want some. All right. It's delicious. Your father left the forms for the civil service exams. Oh, yeah, I see them. What you did the other day in the village really upset me! How do you think your grandparents felt? Leaving your grandfather's party without a word. I had things to do, work and stuff. -You scare me, Gonzalo. -Why? We don't know what to do. We think you've gotten worse. Mom, don't get so upset. What's wrong, mom? You're not upset about that. Tell me, what's wrong? That other nonsense. Apostatizing. What do you gain with that? People are very bad, Gonzalo. The family knows about it. They're all talking. And not just in the family. -It's my business, mom. -No. It isn't, you're doing this to your father, to me, to your sister, and the baby. You're jeopardizing the family's good name. What do you mean? You didn't even dare tell us. We looked stupid in front of everyone. Yeah, that's all you care about. How does it affect you? Don't you see it's something personal? I don't want them keeping information about me, you understand? -I want what's fair. -Fair? Don't talk nonsense. You're lying and leaving us in dire straits on a whim. All of us, and we've tolerated all you've done. And now you want to recant. You're so selfish! You never think of others! You know that isn't true. Calm down. Oh, mom... Forgive me, mom, I'm sorry. Forgive me. I have to go. If you need anything, I don't know, to speak to someone, or if you need to schedule an appointment, tell us, son, all right? Yes, mom, thank you. Because I had a child Who was lost I have a child who is lost If God does nothing to help me I'm going to lose my mind If God does nothing to help I'm going to lose my mind EDUCATION Oh, if you were aching In body and soul Oh, I was aching, too In the same way I am aching, too In the same way I am aching, too In the same way... Hello. Hello. Do you guys have class today? No, I brought this for Antonio. Oh, OK. Come in. -I don't want to bother you. -No, really. -I don't... -No, come in. All right. Antonio! -Can I get you anything? -No, thank you. -Sure? -Yes, I just came to leave this. I made cookies. Cookies... Then I'll have one. Thanks. Antonio! -Hello. -Hello. How are you? I brought you this. Thank you! It was time he had his own. Thank you. Well, I'll go now. OK. Pilar. Curly! -What are you doing here? -I was looking for you. -Looking for me? -Yes -Why? -To take you home with me. What for? To be together, to tell the family. -You're joking. -No. -Yes, you are. -No. Carlos said he was sorry. We're going to try again. Pili! -Help me with this. -Go on! Hey! What brings you here? I didn't know you were coming. Be careful with wall. -Shall I help you? -No, it's OK. Right here, by the case. Let's see... Wait, lower this end. Now the other one. Thanks! Well, what do you think? It's lovely. -It's nice, isn't it? -Yes. Congratulations. Thanks. What did I tell you? I've got more boxes in the car. Will you give me a hand? Then we can have a drink. -Sure. -See you downstairs. You are... You're beautiful. So are you. Gonzalo Tamayo? Yes. In Madrid, on this date, we inform Mr. Tamayo that this tribunal has rejected his request to cancel his baptismal record. The tribunal considers that it's the record of a historical event, and given that its nature is not that of a database, it is inviolable. This decision cannot be appealed, and the file will be closed on this date with the number of 4321. Bishop Jorge! Bishop! You didn't take my advice. You didn't break the habit of badmouthing of God and his Holy Church. What do you want? I can't pretend. That's how I am. Why? Have you been persecuted? Yes, as a wizard, a freemason, a rake, and who knows what else. And for being incongruous! Wherever you are, even in front of strangers, you say what you wish. I have done nothing to deserve this horrible persecution. My son, you are foulmouthed when you speak of those who are the most deserving of great respect and obedience. Think whatever you want, but keep it to yourself. You must be civilized and accept things as they are. You could be a perfect man. You must surrender. I hold out my hand to support you and raise you up, and you ignore it. He allows sad events to happen, so he can enforce His divine justice. Sleep now, son. All doors are closed to me, Father. What can I do? Some issues are only solved by leaving them without a solution. Are you OK? Yes. You want to come up? Wait, I'll turn on the light. Come in, Maite. -May I open the window? -Yes, of course. -Would you like something else? -No, this is fine. Is Antonio asleep? Yes. Antonio really likes being with you. I like being with him, too. -I'm leaving now. -OK. -Bye. -Bye. A judge in the Valencia High Court has forbidden notes being made in Church records. I'm sure you've heard. He says they're not a database. The Church's old argument is now sanctioned by a lay tribunal. What a country! Just like mine, every process has come to nothing. Some groups hope to be excommunicated for promoting atheism. But I'm not joining that crowd, because being an atheist... That's pretty snobby! And because all this waiting has deflated me. Send me some photos of the baby when you can. She must be beautiful. I'll find some time to visit you. An enormous hug. Gonza -Antonio! -Hi, Gonza. Mom said she has to stay at work and asked if you can walk me to school? Sure. Let's go. We only got 10 minutes. Did you know my class found out that I like Nati? Yeah? Finally. -How did it happen? -Good morning. Good morning. I told Teresa, and she told the class. Oh, my! -'Morning. -Good morning. It's not the best way, but they were bound to find out. I was never going to tell her. -Why not? -Because everyone likes her. -'Morning. -Good morning. P.S... I go from euphoria to melancholy at the blink of an eye. Currently, I'm tackling things with a vitality I haven't had in ages. I feel more sure of everything, even though events are speeding up. I am certain that joyous times of chaos are approaching.
