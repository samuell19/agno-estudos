Hello, Morten! Later, I'm busy right now. [TALK OR DIE] THE SECRET OF THE BLACK WIDOW fansubs by fopper123 proof-reading by pushwithlegs FANSUBS ARE FREE - NOT FOR SALE, AUCTION OR RENT. Good evening, Mr. Wellby. Good evening... ...in the middle of the night. Cigar? -I'm on duty, sir. Off duty then... -Thank you, sir. Where's Terry now? He's with a dead man, sir. Him, too? With 'that' dead guy, I almost thought, he too... You can take him away. Have you written everything down? Yes, I've taken care of it. The same poison and the same strange method as in the golf club murder case. Careful, the tip of the projectile is poisoned. A very simple method... A rubber spider and a projectile with a poisonous tip. Something like that can be can be shot almost silently with an air pistol. Simple but works very well. But what might that black spider be about? It's really a mess with this... ...'widow'! This looks like a spider and it is a widow. Meaning it's called a 'widow' and it's a spider. Bah, I really wasn't waiting for you to come along. Yes, that's why I dropped by for a quick... ...quick... ...visit. Could you please give me the projectile, inspector. You can bet your life on it, this is a black widow. Do you know what that is? ...you don't know that either? One can't know everything. It's the most poisonous hussy from Central- and South America. I know a lot of widows, but this isn't a merry one. Sorry, I'm a bit drunk, but that's the best state to be in with all this fog. But there isn't any fog. Hah, doesn't matter... I fear Mr. Wellby... Me, too. ...That the doctor will catch a cold if he keeps my hankerchief. I know, gentlemen, that you're sorry, but I quickly have to visit the editors office now. Have a good sleep. SECOND MYSTERIOUS MURDER BY THE 'BLACK WIDOW'. London Sensations, morning issue! Black Widow claims another victim! London Sensations, morning issue! Black Widow claims another victim! Thank you, sir. London Sensations, morning issue! Black Widow claims another victim! Good morning, Mr. Wellby. How's the girlfriend, Jimmy? -Fine, sir. Morning issue! Black Widow claims another victim! London Sensations, morning issue! Black Widow claims another victim! London Sensations, morning issue! Black Widow claims another victim! Good morning, Ms. Dyke. What does he want? Good morning, Ms. Dyke. Good morning. What does he want? Who? Him! The chief was very angry today. Why's that? Because you weren't here on time. But someone has to do the work, Ms. Dyke. We all work, Mr. Wellby. The chief was very... -...Angry today. Yes, sir. Because of your headline. That headline is below our paper. Excuse me. Did you read it? Of course! See, that's what counts. Because you read it, Ms. Dyke, and three million in Her Majesty's flourishing Commonwealth. That's why I write it. He isn't in... Mr. Osborne is attending a... ...conference today. That's how it is... See? I'm already getting better. The man is a journalist. Surely he acted with the best intentions of the paper. 'With the best intentions', how does that help us? The whole thing is just idiotic. I would like to break his neck. It would be enough to dismiss him. Bah! The boss of such an important newspaper should really sanction the headlines before the paper goes to print. Please, please, why don't one of you take over the paper tomorrow if you think you can do a better job. But that's nonsense, Osborne. That's not the point. The deaths of Morten and Robins are very unfortunate, but those arbitrary acts of Wellby... ...could become very unpleasant for us. Especially for you... What do you mean by 'unpleasant'? For us everything is at stake, while he gets paid for this mess! Without money! But with yours in the least. Maybe I'm also responsible for the deaths of Morten and Robins, huh? Well, someone has to be responsible. But none of us. That time it was one of us, too. Don't stir up old dirt, Sellwood. You got your cut. I don't give a damn, my own life is more important to me. Well, who's threatening your honourable life? Nobody yet. And I wouldn't give anyone the advice to do that either. Is there something I can do for you, gentlemen? Another whisky, Mr. Sellwood? No thanks,... ...I've had enough. Can I open the door to the terrace, William? But of course, Helen. The fresh air will surely do good for all of you. Please excuse me, Helen, we all got a little agitated. The deaths of Robins and Morten... Yes, I totally understand you. I was thinking about it, too. But I can imagine that you as men... ...will find it easier than me as a woman... to come up with a way to expose the murderer. You're right, Helen. We have to find the murderer at any cost! After all, anyone of us could get into the same situation... ...and one day find such a 'love letter' on his desk. You're right. But one doesn't have to answer every invitation. What's that supposed to mean? I'm convinced that none of you would accompany me at such an invitation. None of you look like heroes to me. That's why I've chosen to leave England soon enough. Everything else you will hear through my lawyer. My dear friends, I give this 'nice invitation' to you as a dear reminder of me. [TALK OR DIE] Goodbye. Should one of you have counted on my death, I'm sorry. I can't give you that. Death by the hand of a murderer! I would love to have such an exciting end myself. Yeah, yeah. Believe me, Mr. Wellby, until a few days ago I'd never heard of either Morten or that Robins guy. Oh,... ...interesting. They've never been in the paper either. Mr. Wellby,... I've memorized the notes of all English newspapers of the last 30 years! Only you, I know. I'm a phenomenon. If you don't want to believe me, please... ...the archive is at your disposal. Nah, I don't want it. Happy Eastern! Hopefully you will be through with the four million newspapers by then. Mr. Fish, what's that? A ?5 Series C Bank of England note. And who does it belong to? -It belongs to you, Mr. Wellby. No, I'm afraid it belongs to you now. Now, please tell me where I can really find something out about those two. Which year? I'm sorry, Mr. Wellby. Mr. Fish,... ...what's that? A ?5 Series C Bank of England note. And who does it... wow... ha... You can't bribe me, Mr.Wellby. Money doesn't impress me at all, Mr. Wellby. But for ?15 I'll tell you even about the notes on the worst yellow press. I'm listening... Well, on an expedition in Mexico on May the 26th in the year 1951 a man died. His name was Alfons Avery, he was the leader of the expedition, an esteemed English scientist. He died from the bite of a black widow. I don't know if you knew that... ...the black widow is the most poisonous hussy from Central America? You are more educated than your collegues, Mr. Wellby. Yes, but can you imagine how unpopular that makes me, Fish? Then we share the same fortune. Cheers! I'm sorry... Please... -Bless you! Oh, now you will get a cold, too. But for ?15, carry on! Now listen, seven men were members of this expedition. All of a sudden, after the accident of Mr. Avery, they all had a lot of money and they founded a big English company. Which company? Mr. Wellby, you aren't showing any appreciation for the chronological order of my tale. Now... Two of these men were named Morten and Robins. They are dead. You don't say. I think I read that recently in the paper. No, wait, I even wrote it myself. Exactly. The names of the others are Brian, Cartwright, Sellwood, Broomfield... and Osborne. Osborne,... surname? William. Our Osborne? Your Osborne, Mr. Wellby! And the company they founded is currently the biggest English newspaper 'London Sensations'. For which you happen to hold the honour of being the chief journalist. That's exactly what I wanted to say. You're fantasizing! Mr. Wellby, up until now reality used to destroy all of my fantasies. Just a moment, please. -Osborne... I knew that you would show up. Here are the documents. Don't you have it any smaller? [AVERY EXPEDITION IN MEXICO] Mr. Broomfield. Clarisse. Oh... -Yes, he's still here. Seems the lady didn't want to spend too much money. I'm sorry. I'm actually happy about it. There are things that get so close to one's heart that one doesn't want to give them away anymore. Not even as a businessman. What's money anyway, it slips away as fast as your life. But one needs it, it's important, isn't it? For what? One can't buy love nor peace nor health with it. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, sir. Oh... beautiful! How can I help you? St. Anthony... ...he's beautiful, too. Actually I just wanted to talk to Mr. Broomfield, would that be possible? That would be me. Oh,... please excuse the 'just'... I just wanted to say that I'm a reporter for London Sensations... Wellby is my name, can I ask you a few... I don't see how I could be of any help to you, but please. Excuse me, sir. Do you need St. Anthony right now? Well, in these days just about everyone needs such a little patron saint, with the Black Widow on the loose in London. But... ...maybe he's doing something for me here too. One never knows. Mr. Bloomfield, just by chance I've found out, that you've been... you've surely read about it,... ...friends with both poor victims in this horrible affair. You understand, this is my job... I understand. Please take a seat. You are wrong, Mr. Wellby. There was no friendship between me and those two men. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I mean, now those two gentlemen are already... ...gone anyway. But you did know them, didn't you? Why would you think that? Now, I mean, if one goes on... ...on an expedition together. Oh, yes, yes... You're thinking about the Avery Expedition. In Mexico. Yes, yes, yes... ...of course. Since you're so well informed... ...you'll undoubtedly know, that Prof. Avery... ...died from the bite of a black widow. What is it, Ms. Miller? Excuse me, Mr. Broomfield, there's an express letter from Mexico. Ah! What do you mean? Just now we were talking about Mexico and there she is. What did we talk about? About the Black Widow, sir. You were talking about the Avery Expedition. You know, I later lost contact with the other members of the expedition. Not so surprising, since the expedition hadn't been a success. Too bad. What's too bad? Just everything... that the expedition was a failure. That you lost contact with the other two gentlemen. And that you haven't been friends. One, two and dead you are. And then it's too late. And you can't tell me anything about the character of those two either? Excuse me, Mr. Wellby, but so much time has passed and so many things have happened that I can't remember anything. Please don't think of me as an impolite man, but you have to excuse me now, I have work to do. Oh, that was very telling now. I mean, I'll just write something now, just like one does. From my heart I wish you well, Mr. Broomfield. Maybe we'll meet again. Goodbye, Ms. Miller. Goodbye. A tough job, being a reporter, you know? Did you hear? No. Hear what? That's it, nothing. If you knew about all the horrible things in the world you would be very proud! About what? About your St. Anthony. You're interested in antiques? Very... He who doesn't value the old isn't worth the young. Hmmm... I'm not a poet, please excuse me. Say it isn't so. I'm only a reporter and not all I'm saying has to be good. It's nothing evil, just whisky. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Drinking before noon? Strangely enough, no. I'm not very brave, you know. That doesn't fit my job, but if I take a sip from the bottle I become as courageous as a lion. Why would you have to be courageous now? I'd like a rendevous with you. You're crazy! Not a bit, that's just an act. You'll learn that soon enough... You are... oh... I just wanted to tell you, that you're really beautiful. Not just your St. Anthony. And I'm gonna shave again, too. What do you think? [unintelligible] Mr. Wellby just arrived. Send him in, please. Good morning, Osborne! -Drunk again... What do you think about todays issue? We've sold 50,000 more today! Mr. Wellby! I'm not interested in increased circulation, if the quality of our paper goes down the drain. Your articles, especially the one from today, make us look like gutter press. 'Widow press'. -Wellby! Now, how do you look like? Don't talk about it, I'm already ashamed. Too youthful? Bah! -Oh, well... Running a stupid theory about a murder as the headline! Oh, Osborne, what do you want me to write? Do you want me to quote Thucydides and Goethe...? I can't listen to it anymore! I can't stand it no more! If we both... If you... If you refuse to understand me, then... ...then we both have to accept the consequences. Osborne, I'm sorry about that. If you fire me... Our competition isn't too pleased with their guy anyway, so maybe you wanna trade me in? Goodbye. Wellby... Wellby... I didn't mean it that way. Ah... You look horrible without a beard. No question, you'll stay with us, right? I have only one demand... 'plea'... that from now on you'll coordinate your headlines with me. Well, a journalist sometimes forgets about the political dimension of his - surely well ment - ambition. Yes, yes, politics... I got you. I've got a feeling I'm still your man for the job. We're all just human. -That's right. Another thing, Wellby,... I want to ask you to be a little more discreet in the future when you're doing your journalistic investigations. Yes. So that I won't hear any more complaints like that recent one from Mr. Broomfield. Oh...! -Take care, anyway. I would be so sorry... -What? ...if you would ever burn your ears Dyke. You better be careful that you don't get burned. How do you like me without a beard? Oh so handsome... That's what I thought. Well... Mr. Wellby? Why? What does he want? Yes, that would be possible. Just let him come. I'll teach him not to be so nosy. London Sensations! London Sensations! London Sensations! London Sensations! How's the bride, Jimmy? Better and better, Mr. Wellby. London Sensations! London Sensations! Mr. Wellby? Sir? You've stirred up a hornets' nest. You think so? It's thrilling that you're interested in this, but did I have the pleasure? A sensation is always cheap, Mr. Wellby. Not only does it sometimes start with a death, sometimes it ends with one as well. Is that so? Now I know you, you're a quiz master on the telly. No, that's not what I am. I'm talking about the Morten and Robins case. You, too? -Yes, me too. Just so that you know: It's the job of the police to solve it. If they don't solve the case, then life doesn't want the case to be solved. Good afternoon, Mr. Wellby. Morning, chief. I would like to talk with Mr. Sellwood, is that possible? Thank you. Morning, chief. I want to talk to Mr. Sellwood, please. Really, sir? -Really, sir! Down there? -Yep. Comfy! -Yeah. Oh...! Ah... Which one of the two gentlemen would be Sellwood now? Mr. Sellwood. Excuse me, gentlemen... ...for bothering you. I won't waste too much of your precious time. I just wanted to ask if one of the gentlemen could change a shilling for me. How do you want it, sir? Anything will be fine, sir. I've had enough for today, I'm not twenty anymore. One more thing I wanted to tell you, sir... Don't you think I'm a selfless man. No...! But I was so hoping you were one, sir. Which one of the gentlemen was Sellwood now? None? Fine with me. Thanks a lot. Take care of my luggage, please. -Yes, sir. Ahhhh! -Someone fell into the water! Where? Good evening! Can I come in? This is my place after all. Oh, there you are. Fish! What are you doing here? Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Mr. Wellby, I really have to say: 'How nasty of you!' Me? What are you looking for? There's not a single drop of whisky to be found anywhere in this nautical home. And they say seafaring is a wet occupation. I see. Why didn't you tell me that right away? You know everything here can be stolen from me... ...everything but this. Phenomenal! What a great idea! Yes, every home needs a personal touch. Now what expansive news do you have? Outrageous news about Avery and company... That's nice. Yet, it probably isn't going to be that nice, right? That's how well I know you. I don't understand why you're living on this ship... especially in this inadequate area, while there are so many nice villas in London. Yeah, yeah, yeah... Mr. Fish,... what's that? Mr. Wellby, you haven't answered my question yet. You're right, I really have to save some money now, so I'll answer your question. Well,... I inherited this ship. And because I easily get a little seasick I just tied it up and live on it. My ancestors were all capable seafarers, but I'm... May I ask for another one? Excuse me,... I'm only the poor 'afterbirth'... Mr. Fish,... now you have had three... ...and a half whiskies. I gave you a tour through my whole ancestral portrait gallery... If you don't tell me now what you know... I'll have to arrange for an open air bath in the Thames for you, sir. I don't care much for water, Mr. Wellby. Then I have to pay. Okay then. And don't worry my employer will pay for it. But... -That makes it easier for me. ...one should be enough, right? Now, when Prof. Avery died he left behind a daughter. That was twenty years ago, she was still a child at that time... Oh... Just why is your mouth open? Are you sure she isn't a child anymore? Oh, yes. Now just tell me that she's living in London and... She does, Mr. Wellby. She does. Her surname is Clarisse, I've read it in a magazine of the Archaeological Society. Tell me, you don't happen to know if she's black? I don't cultivate female acquaintances, Mr. Wellby. It's a pity,... but I still do. So her name is Clarisse... Yes. Why? Do you think you know her? Er,... I'm not sure yet. But how do you like me without the beard? Huh...? Oh, you shaved your beard off! You notice everything! I'll memorize this bit of information. Yes, you do that, Mr. Fish. You do that. So... -Yes... Tonight was a worthwhile evening. Now it's on you, Mr. Wellby, to gather further information. It's already late, I'll have to say goodbye now. This way! I better escort you then, I don't want something bad to happen to you, your information is just too valuable to me. Nothing is going to happen to me, I'm a certified archivist of Her Majesty. Maybe... God save the Queen and you. Goodnight, Mr. Wellby. Goodnight, Mr. Fish. I see that you're a marksman, but can I ask you to stop with all this shooting now? I've seen enough. I don't do it just for the fun of it. That Wellby bloke is very dangerous. Why didn't you fire him? Because then I wouldn't be able to control him at all. He's a good journalist... and could start working for the competition by tomorrow. Who knows what he would be writing then? I'm much more worried about the Black Widow. Sellwood... or Broomfield. Or Avery's daughter. Nah... I don't think it's a woman. I don't believe either that it's a young girl. By now Avery's daughter is probably living in a village and married to some teacher. But who else could it be? Broomfield wouldn't have a motive. Sellwood...? Maybe. Sellwood is always broke. Don't forget that the survivors will get the assets of the dead. Today the murderer is still working in our favour, by tomorrow he might work for himself. So it might not be Sellwood. One should find out where Avery's daughter lives and invite her over. What? Yes, to get to know her a little better. Do you really have to make such a noise? I have to be at my best... tonight. We're in the last minute of the overtime. The outcome of this match is still open. Everything is still possible. Yes, it looks like... a cross to the center... Brilliant! 80,000 are holding their breath. The right midfielder is all alone... He gets the ball... He shoots... and... Goal!!! Yes! Goal! A dramatic moment! Yes, that's the 3:2! A well earned victory for... Mr. Wellby,... I'm not allowed to tell you anything about the Morten and Robins investigations. You know that just as well as I do. Also, I don't trust you. You came to me for another reason. But of course I have a reason for my visit, Mr. Terry, I want to help to catch the murderer. You always think that... ...but you're wrong. We journalists are very decent people, one only has to do what we want... Mr. Wellby, we don't need... -Yes, sir? I assume you're Mr. Wellby? ...we don't need your help at Scotland Yard! Keep that in mind! And your articles in the paper aren't really helping us but that criminal instead. I don't have a very high opinion of the press myself, but I also don't have such a low one. Let's just work together and also do something for our Queen! Who won? -Liverpool... 3:2, sir. What? But that's impossible! Er... Mr. Wellby, I also have to tell you that I can't pardon your previous behaviour. Cambridge lost. -Don't lose hope! Mr. Wellby, in your - and our - interest I have to advise you... to let the police do the police work. Stay out of this case. Yes, sir. Goodbye, sir. [MS. CLARISSE AVERY] [TALK OR DIE] [TALK OR DIE] Mr. Wellby! What's got into you? Maybe you've had success with this kind of invitation with others, but not with me. Either you let me get out of the car right now, or you bring me home. Answer me already! You shaved off your beard! Yes, the beard is gone. Ms. Miller, or... 'Ms. Avery'? How many names do you use anyway? Would you answer a few questions for me? I don't think I have to answer any of your questions. Maybe, how's Mr. Brian? Good evening, Mr. Wellby. Your table is reserved for you. Please... He has arrived. I already spotted him. Thank you. Two whiskies? -Yes. Would you please explain to me now, Mr. ... Wellby! ...what's this all about? Your spying, your... dubious way of inviting girls and then... this even more dubious place. Please let me listen to this first, I love classics. I'll tell you that right away. Thank you. There is a woman, who in the dark of the city, has thoughts of hate and vitiation. She kills in the shadows, and avoids the light. And nobody knows her face. You walk through the streets and don't look back Maybe you are dreaming of fortune and love, when you get hit by a shot and your life slips away. A scream gets carried away by the wind. And nobody knows how it happened. Because nobody who ever saw her is still alive. The Black Widow, who is that woman? She finds her victim and it's never a miss. Why are the streets so lonely and empty? Why are all the people walking around so scared? There is a woman, who in the dark of the city, has made a deal with death. Do you like it? I think it's tasteless. There are things that are much more tasteless, Ms. Miller. I'm sorry, Ms. Avery. You may enjoy your secretiveness,... but I don't. And nobody knows how it happened. Because nobody who ever saw her is still alive. The Black Widow, who is that woman? She finds her victim and it's never a miss. Why are the streets so lonely and empty? Why are all the people walking around so scared? There is a woman, who in the dark of the city, has made a deal with death. You see, if you find things like these... for instance... ...much more tasteless. With what right did you...? Right? You're talking about 'rights' when you're writing such notes? Do you know Inspector Terry? He's a man that looks very noble, but isn't. Because of that it would be very wise of you to open up to me. Prison beds aren't very comfortable, you know? Your passport! Oh... sorry. -Oh, hello. Mr. Wellby? Mr. Wellby? Yes? Oh, it's you again. Mr. Wellby, you lost your wallet. Surely because of the hurry. And you won't have credit everywhere. Oh, thank you. Also, I'm pleased that you show more interest in young women now than in black widows. That kept the deaths of Cartwright and Brian out of London Sensations' headlines. And that's good for you. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye. Two days ago Cartwright,... yesterday Brian,... tomorrow it's us. We'll all kick the bucket, it's only a question of time. That's not true, Broomfield. Not all of us will kick the bucket, someone will outlive the others for sure. But... one thing I promise you, irregardless of which one of you two is the murderer, he won't get me. Your accusations are becoming childish! Didn't it occur to you yet, that you could be the bastard? I...? -Yes, you! Every shilling you own you gamble away... Who would need to speculate with our agreements? We? Or you? Osborne,... I warn you! But these mutual accusations are pointless. Nobody thinks about Avery's daughter. Maybe it's her after all. William, why haven't you searched for her yet? But that's nonsense, Helen. I mean, what reason could she have? A reason that's very close to a womans heart... ...revenge. Maybe she knows more than we think. I believe it would be best if we informed the police and asked for protection. But that's impossible. The police would ask questions 'til they... The only thing that'll get us is a ticket to Dartmoor. That's just great, choosing between death and Dartmoor. Perhaps one of us should anonymously tip off the police about Clarisse Avery. But Helen... even with us fearing for our lives, we can't just put the blame on someone, who might be totally innocent. I won't take part in that. I don't want to die either, but someday one has to pay for the mistakes made in the past. Oh, it seems you've become sensitive all of a sudden. Think about it! Our past is soon to fall under the statute of limitations anyway. The only thing we can lose is a little money. And you... not even that! I don't trust him. Either he's becoming senile or he's smarter than all of us. Maybe he's right. If everything could be fixed with money... Do what you want! I'll disappear... but not like Cartwright. I want my cut first. My share of the London Sensation. Now? Yes. Right now. Alright, just like you want it. There. What is this, a lousy ?450? ?450 and 4 shillings, that's your share. Do you want to tell me by that...? ...that the rest including dividends has already been given to you as an advance, and that you have already run through it at the races. That's what I want to tell you. You nobbler! Without my share you would have gotten nothing! You bastard! So do you want to pay me or not? I've paid you. Osborne... I'll get my justice and I'll get my money. You're gonna hear from me. Do you want me to recommend a good lawyer to you? That dirty bastard. I heard everything, Charly. Please don't be upset. Hand me a piece of paper. But where should we go? We? Oh, yes. We're going to France. But first I have to do something. Poor Charly, how much money does Osborne still owe you? That's none of your business. Type this letter for me and sneak it into his mail. I'm in a hurry. Charly,... do you love me? Of course, Evelyn. You know that. Well,... Here I am again. Yes, there you are again. Ms. Avery... I've had my beard shaved off, you see? Not completely, but still. And I've had new suits tailored. They're not completly new, but still. And sometimes, just for you, I force myself to smile. Not completely, but still. Child, now to do something for you, too. Do you want me to smile, too? No, you really have no reason to smile. Not at all... We need to have a very serious conversation. But you talk all the time. You... I could be your older brother. I hope you understand what I mean by that. I don't want to use an educational method of that kind, but you enter this room right now and ask Broomfield to let you leave early today. Will you do that? -No, I won't do that. Ms. Avery,... I acted very silly yesterday. But you think of me as an old drunkard anyway, so... But don't forget that old drunkards can sometimes have the best intentions... So,... Only water. I'm a bit nervous... very nervous... I understand that you have your doubts that your father died in a way we would all like to die someday. Let's even assume this mysterious Aztec treasure really existed and that those seven little Indians stole it and sold it... There's no doubt about that. Just a moment, it's all fine and dandy. I mean, it isn't dandy. And it isn't fine eiter. If you don't stop playing judge, then one day you will be the only one accused. Don't you understand that? You delightful little silly-billy, every one of those dead men is accusing you. Me? I'm the one accusing. But accusing doesn't mean writing mute little notes, Clarisse. Just leave me alone, you. Take care of your own business. Clarisse... Clarisse! Sir, please pay. Oh, I'm sorry. A tea, a whisky and all else that's laying around here. Oh, thank you, sir. Throw the ball to me. But Clarisse... Clarrisse, don't act like a child now. I can't take it no more, can't you see that? Let me go, I have to be alone. -Shush! Please... Please let us go, we have to be alone. Then go back home. But she doesn't want to. But you've got children yourselves... -The young lady is not a child anymore. She's a woman, that's worse. Right? I only want to prevent that you become a victim of your own victims, Clarisse. Do you have to drive so fast? Yep. Look behind you. Why? Do you like what you see? Do you know him? Yep. He's a touchingly tender bloke. Who is it? The man is very nice, but I don't want to meet him again. He's still behind us. I know. -Don't drink, drive. He's not allowed to do me any harm in front of the police. Quick, out! What a handsome bloke, isn't he? But now I've earned a sip, right? Yeah. Oh... oh... oh, that must have happened while getting out of the car. Oh, such a big girl. I haven't been fast enough... Now, is this proper behaviour? -Mr. Wellby? You drive a little bit too fast. I wasn't able to keep up with you and was worried that you might get killed. My dear Mr. Wellby, your ambitions are slowly becoming a threat to your life. I'm always happy when I see you, but today... it's a little wet... I have some urgent fatherly duties... Goodbye, sir. Goodbye, sir. Haha,... Actual blackmail. The murderer needs money. He can't wait 'til he has killed us all. Maybe she's feeling the heat? Why are you saying 'she'? It's signed 'The Black Widow'. Who says that the Black Widow has to be a woman? Lawrence is right,... it's probably a man. And I think I know him. Sellwood. Yes, the amount asked for is almost exactly the same as his share in the company. Even if he has already got it back through all the advances, but... This letter is the best starting point for the police. You have to inform the police. Yes, William, that's the best thing we can do. Er,... I... Then Sellwood is gonna talk. But you can't pay such a criminal this amount of money again and again and for nothing. For nothing? For my life, Helen. And as long as I can buy that with money,... I'll do it. What do you mean, you do what's possible? Nothing, that's what you're doing, Terry. You haven't done anything yet. You come up with theories... think about the pros and cons without ever coming to a decision. Sir John, X-13 advises against any action at this time and he must have good reasons for that. Those are all excuses, nothing more! Do you want to wait 'til even more decent London citizens become murder victims? X-13 knows his business, he is without a doubt one of our most capable men. Only his cologne sometimes gets a little on my nerves, but besides that... X-13 has come to the conclusion, sir, and I support that analysis, that all external circumstances heavily incriminate Sellwood. Nonsense! Sellwood has a really good alibi. -Hmmm. With Mr. Sellwood's circle of acquaintances it's only natural to have a really good alibi, sir. Mr. Wellby... Ah, don't bother me with this lovestruck journalist again! He'll be surprised when I... I mean, when you... or... both of us... will expose his beloved Clarisse Avery for murdering four people. Ms. Avery, I have no reason to lie to you. People within the circle of the victims friends, and because of that the police as well, think that you are the Black Widow. You shouldn't have wasted your time to find me, Mrs. Osborne. I'm able to prove my innocence to Scotland Yard. Someone's innocence often gets crushed by circumstantial evidence. But I haven't done anything wrong. 'Wrong',... 'wrong' is a word open to interpretation... What incriminates you is... a contractual agreement between all the London Sensation's shareholders, which guarantees you the assets of the shareholders once they're dead. But Mr. Broomfield also made a testament, that... if he should be the last survivor, you would be his sole heiress. Yes, but... I knew nothing about that. Who will believe you,... using a false name, you've almost become more than just Mr. Broomfield's secretary? But I... And him not even knowing about your real name. May I? Mrs. Osborne...? I had my reasons for this, reasons the police will understand. You're very young, my child,... and I wouldn't have this conversation with you, if... if my husband hadn't received a letter from the Black Widow. I've nothing to do with the deaths of your friends, please believe me! I do believe you, but that won't help you much. In my opinion, the murderer is a well known figure in London's underworld... a gambler. Just nobody shares my opinion. And this gambler also won't hesitate to murder Clarisse Avery to reach his goal. Mrs. Osborne... did you come to me to predict my death? No. I was worried about my husband. And should you ever need help or feel the need to talk with somebody our house will always be open for you. Goodbye. Are you sure he will pay? Very sure. He has more to lose than me. Come to the club as soon as you've got the money. But what if he stops me? But you're a grown woman... don't go there until he's gone. Can't we go together? Nah, don't talk so much. In the meantime I'll deal with the Black Widow. Charly! -Don't worry. I won't kill her. She only has to be neutralized until we're gone. And then... she's free to continue her killing. But with the little difference that she'll have to pay us hush money every month from then on. Clarisse? Clarisse!? Mr. Wellby. I fear you'll have to face trespassing charges soon. You... I've had really enough of you. Who or what are you, you strange graveyard spy!? I really want an answer now! I wouldn't get in a fist fight with Scotland Yard if I were you. May I...? I see... you're police. Well, that makes it even worse, you standing there and doing nothing while I get shot at instead of doing something!? A flower bouquet has to save me, look at that! Yes, he that loveth danger shall perish in it. Don't you start with the bible now, while I'm standing here as a soldier... ...of printing ink. Those are needed, too, and I like being alive. Besides, I just arrived two minutes ago when you were still climbing out of your grave of books. Without your leap-frogs we would've caught her. Yeah, without my leap-frogs she would have caught me. It would be quite interesting to know if Clarisse Avery has been the shooter, or if she was supposed to become the victim. Ms. Avery the perpetrator? Will I be charged for libelling an official if I do this with my finger? It depends. We usually don't take someone lovestruck at your age too serious. We're both interested in Ms. Avery's life, only our motives are different. What's 'at your age' supposed to mean? I'm still in a good condition. [unintelligible] inspector, huh? Ahhhh! Who are you? What do you want? You ask too many questions. And for too long now. Leave! Now! Or I'll call the police! You, Ms. Avery? You have more reasons to fear the police than I have! What do you mean by that? That the police would be more bothered by it than me, that you 'took care' of my friends. Running away from me or screaming for help would be futile. I also took the liberty, to do a little blackmailing of Mr. Osborne in your name. This very day he's gonna pay up. What do you want? What do I want? To go on a trip. But since I don't want you to shoot me before I go away... I'll tie you up good! And when you're found tomorrow... I'll already have crossed the English Channel! I'll be safe! Let me go! Help! Help...! Rascal! Help!! Help!! Hel... Help! Help!! Help!! Good evening, sir! Are you Mr. Sellwood? He is. Careful, Wellby! He won't bite me, he's a vegetarian! Wellby... Yes, sir? It's the second time today that I had flowers for you. What did he want from you? I don't know. He thinks I'm the Black Widow. Really? And he said something about Osborne and going away and... And that he blackmailed Osborne and... that Osborne will pay the money today. Do you have to drink all the time? No, but when I forget to drink before a dangerous situation I drink afterwards. It's really nice that you care, thank you very much. Did you say 'Osborne'? Yes! Let's go to Osborne then! That was him. Why don't you follow him then? Because I don't want to scare him in this fog. I'll go with you. Shush! Shush! Mr. Wellby? Please be careful! I'm sorry, but I haven't heard that for a long time... Don't you have to take care of something? Yes, but... One thing after another, right? Ah...! Mr. Wellby,... but what are you doing here? We're all working, Ms. Dyke, even deep in the woods and at night. Give me that package! No, that's not gonna happen. Leave it to me and see that you get home quick! No, that's really not gonna happen. Give it to me and YOU see that you get home quick! May I, Ms. Dyke? Ah! ...oh! I'm not such a ladies man like Mr. Wellby. -Is that so? At least don't lose her. I'll do my best. Goodbye! -Knowing you we'll meet again soon. Ladies first! Everywhere. Do you have a problem? Yes, now you can really help me... I parked my car with Ms. Avery in it, right there, and now I can't find her or the car. Yes, Ms. Avery is always good for a surprise... Get in! I thought we were going to look for her? Yes, yes, we'll check the lost property office. Mr. Osborne? The Black Widow... What happened to my father Alfons Avery on March 26th 1951? So it's true... You're the Black... Widow. -Sit down. Who killed him? It... it was an accident. You know that. It was printed in all the papers. I didn't ask what was printed in the papers. Who killed him? Ms. Avery,... please believe me! Stay where you are and answer me! It was really an accident. Nobody... had any intentions to kill him, but... But? Don't you try to make any noise. Please, sir. -Thank you. William? William? Ah, there you are. Clarisse? I'm sorry, Mr. Broomfield, but I have to ask you to be quiet, too. You can help Mr. Osborne answer my questions. But Clarisse... do we have to have this conversation with a pistol... This conversation, yes. My name isn't Miller but Avery. My father was Prof. Alfons Avery. Clarisse,... I knew that. You knew that? She's the Black Widow! Say what you want, I don't believe it's her. But it's her! And you knew it! You're hand in glove with her! Now I see everything clear! Sit down again, Mr. Osborne, and lower your voice! What happened to my father? William,... tell her. Clarisse,... your father was shot. Who? I don't know. And probably Osborne doesn't know either. It was someone from our group. But then you have to know! We never tried to find out who it was. Someone killed him, one person did, not all of us. Our crime was... to keep quiet about it and to steal the Aztec treasure. You bastard! You traitor! William... -Bah! I had to get that off my chest. And now... we go to the police. You won't do that. Not anymore... No! No! No! But Helen? You... you can't... Yes I can. Helen... You... are the Bl...? Yes I am. Why did you... did you do all that? Killing? Murdering? I like money. And I think one can never have enough of it. But... you have all this! Yes,... now. And you I loved... William, I did it for both of us. This girl... -Won't go to the police... she wrote the letters. And Broomfield... I'm innocent. No, no, no, I don't have anything to do with it. The police... I'll go to the police. No, you won't. I... I can't take it anymore. Murderer! And who did Avery? That was 15 years ago. Isn't it enough that I have been thinking about it every night for 15 years? I can't take it anymore. And I don't want it anymore either. The police... [unintelligible] Leave me alone, now! William! Ahhhhh! She's not at home. And she isn't at Mr. Broomfield's store? And the car hasn't been found either? Yeah. Okay, let the search go on. Thank you. I mean, instead of sitting around here and talking on the phone we could... What? I don't know. Agreed. Since she isn't home we'll start with her place then go to Broomfield and Osborne. Why go to Osborne? But she disappeared with him. We take a squad car. Where does a young girl go if she can't sleep? To her lover. Don't you try to scream or to escape, I guarantee you that you would be dead in a second. Haven't you done enough already? What do you want from me? Kill me, too? That's all up to you. Sit down. The police knows that I'm here. That won't help you much, if you aren't reasonable. Give it to me. This is X-13,... Attention all squad cars in grid square 49! Search the whole neighbourhood from the north to the marina. The license plate number we're looking for is: K-L-U ZERO SIX SIX. It's an MG. Did you copy me? Over. Y-16. We're coming from Leicester Square. The license plate number we are looking for is: K-L-U ZERO SIX SIX. It's an MG. Over. C-9. Copy you. We're coming from Covent Garden. They're supposed to protect and serve... bah... they can't even drive a car. Oh, pardon me. Maybe signing it will be easier for you without your pistol. I didn't kill these men and I'm not the Black Widow either. No? And who wrote the 'TALK OR DIE' letters? You killed, not me! But in your name. Sign it. No. Then you'll die sooner. Good evening, Mr. Wellby...! Haha,... pardon,... hahaha... Oh, pardon, seems I got the wrong house number. Good evening. Ohhhhh...! You know,... maybe she's on my yacht. Sure, sure, in your heart. We go to Osborne now. You better leave him here, because that would be theft. Of course I was very surprised! But I forced myself and fought my way back in, no, I mean out. So hurry up man, send the Flying Squad right away. I won't let those two leave this place. And where do we find this ship exactly? 'The marina' 'Pier 15' 'The Wellby yacht' Okay, we'll take care of it. Your name? 'Fish', yes, like a fish in the water. Of course with an 'F' or do you think it's written with an 'U'? Huh. I hope they don't have a tyre failure now. Squad car AZ-7 to the marina immediately! Pier 15, the Wellby yacht. St. Anthony! A woman is held at gunpoint by another woman. The call came from a Mr. Fish,... the man is waiting at the pier. Clarisse! Yes, yes, but who is she threatening? Stop with those silly jokes, who is threatening her? I don't know, sir. But you be quiet... No, no, you keep talking, I mean, listen to me... To the marina, but floor it! This is X-13,... Attention all squad cars! Sign it! Don't believe that this will save you. Why? Is your signature on this confession worth so little? You go ahead! If you try to escape... it will be an escape to heaven. This way. Freeze! Who is it? Don't you move! Who's that? That? That's Clarisse Avery. I can see that, but the other one? Helen Osborne. [unintelligible] We'll have to approach her from the outside or she'll escape. Do you know of a boat...? Yes. Three men to the ramp! The rest follow me! Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! Don't shoot, or we'll hit the wrong one. Stop. Stop! No! Please, don't! Oh, please, don't! Faster! 'Helen Osborne'... would you have thought that? No, you? I'm press, you're the police. But you're only shooting holes into the air, man! Now we're gonna bring this thing to an end. I wish you too would just shoot holes into the air. Get closer and keep up the same pace! Clarisse! Ahhhhhhhhh! Come on! Come on! Hold onto my hand! That's it! Thanks chief! [unintelligible] You're like a mother, thank you. Horrible. If we had let her she would've killed us all. Uahhhhh! Aaaaaah! -What now? There! There! Fish! Swim Fish! We'll take you with us! Alright! Swim? But I don't know how to swim! THE END
