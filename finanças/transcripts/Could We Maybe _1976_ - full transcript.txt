Who says so? - I can't have you come up. - So I see. - Have you done your homework? - No, I had to wash up. B of the second minus 4AC, all divided by 2A. Thus we have a formula... after which we can solve all second-degree equations, so... Let be with it... Can we solve such an equation? Is there always a value for x, for which the equation will be true? And the answer is that we can't always. For certain things, we may encounter obstacles. For example, the square root sign... Kim... Kim! - Can you explain? - Read there. "One night Mr. May said..." What is it? Hello. Shut up! Where were you at school today? Fuck! Were you on acid? Figure it out. Shut up! You have a color TV? How fat! Bet it's cool, huh? - Stop it there. - No, no, let me try. Hold off. My Mom will piss gallons. - You are lucky, man. - It's only rented. What the fuck. It has to be something. - We're going into town, right? - I don't know. Aren't we going? - Grab some of your Mom's smokes. - No, she fucking counts them. - Shut up, who's is this? - His. That moron, Lassesen. - How'd you get in? - I took the free door. The young man who took the side door... you didn't pay. The bus doesn't run until you do. Loan me 2 kroner. Shut up! Look at the Suzuki. It's damned sweet. Kim, do you see THE MAN there? Do you know what he has in the case? He has a machine gun. He's going to take it out and shoot us. Do you know how we fix him? - No. - You trip him. He falls. Then he gets a quick punch. Then one in the stomach. He goes down, then just one last karate-chop, man. Hey, we should get off. There are whores down here... Yes, there's one there. - No! - Wow. Hello, darling. What is your name? - How much does it cost to watch? - The one with the smokes is hot! Some are still ugly. - What's it cost to see your tits? - Fuck off home and do your homework! - We'd rather look at you. - How much are you? They can't be worth more than a 10'er. What are doing here... Huh, wimps? Who are you here for? Your mother? - No, she's at work. - Then don't bother the ladies. Why are you talking trash down here? We're just talking. - Why don't you go home? - Yeah? Yeah... - You're Dad working? - Yes, as it happens. - He's been working in Jutland. - Going to move? Yes! But the old man has promised me a new moped. - What are you getting? - The Suzuki. - Of course you are. - So you have to move? - Yes, I don't have a choice. Hey, check out the little dog.

It's sweet, it is. Kim! Kim... come here. - Where have you been? - In town. - Where in town? - Just in the city with Ole. What gutter in the city? - Where are the potatoes? - I forgot them. You can never remember anything. I need them now! There is no point in trying to fix it now! Do you even care? Mr Jorgensen has complained about your loud music. And about the corridor... after you've tracked grease in. - Don't get so excited. - Your laziness annoys me! Do you think I like having to walk to work? I do it so you can have some extras. I didn't ask you for a color television, did I? Brash and rude! I can't take it anymore! Do you think they have some good crotch panties on them? No, probably some old people's swimming trunks on them. It's good with some lager. Let's drink them now. - Get out! - A shit Monarch. - Let me sit on it. - 2-speed shit. We gonna steal it? - We can break the lock. - With what? No, I fucking don't dare. The cops. I'll just work the pedals. - I need a light. - Hurry up. Do you have a lighter, huh? - Hurry up, Kim. - Coming now. Let's do something here first. See the old hag over there? Hello! What is your name, huh? Huh? Can't answer me? She's deaf. His name's Ole. I'm Kim. Hear him Ole. We need to go and burn down the School of Tomorrow. Because it is so boring! - Kim, shouldn't we quit now? - No, why? Don't you want a sip, huh? Ole, Ole... where are you going? Kim, come on. Now we're going. - Kim, shouldn't we go home now? - No, I am not going home. Kim, we're partners. Kim, we're going home. No I won't! You're stupid! You can just go to hell! I am not going home! Cut it out. Lets go home now. I won't! Kim, now you're done. So let's go home, right? - Would you rather have a beer? - No, that's fine. How are things at home? With your mother? I don't know. She has a new guy. - Well, how is he? - I've only seen him once. His name's John. How's your girlfriend, Susy? She's not my girlfriend. We've just gone out a few times. - You're not interested in her? - No, not really. I imagine it'd be nice for us to go to an opera. - I wouldn't care for it. - Oh, Kim. - You know that. Yes, I like good music! You should go and see Santana. - Santana... What is it? - A beat group. You will not drag your grandmother to hear a beat group! - You've heard them. - I have? - Yeah. They played at Woodstock. - Woodstock, what's that? - Beat Festival in America. I got a 10 on that paper I told you about. - You did? - Yeah. Ah, that's fine! - That I want to read. - I'll bring it next time. I suppose you realize, you didn't come on time. - I was up with grandmother. - Oh yes. How is she? She's well. We had a damned nice time. She asked why you never come by. Yes, I never manage to get over. You don't help any. We must stop and get my dress. Kim, will you be done soon? John hates it if I'm not ready when he comes. - Can I borrow 20 kroner? - What about your allowance? - You owe me 20 cigarettes. - Are you sure? - Yes, yes. - Okay, take them from my bag. Now, don't be out too late tonight. I've got it. - The Christensen's. - Hey Kim. - Hey, Ole. Coming over? I have a spot reserved. - No, I am going to Kurt's party. - Oh? Who's coming? Susy and all the others. You can come. - No, I'm not invited. - It doesn't matter... I'd just tell them I forgot we were going to the movies. - Kirsten coming? - You'd like that, huh? What about drinks? I'm bringing some lager. Fine, then I'll some of the old Hjemmebryg. Well, see you outside of Kurt's at half past 8. - Yes, That's fine. - Hey so long! Don't, Ole. - Aren't you with Kurt? - No, he's boring. - Kurt, remember to clean up. - Yeah, yeah. That is a hot sister you have, Kurt. - Where's she going? - She's off to the movies. You can just go after her, if you think she is so hot. Maybe we could climb over mountains instead of running into brick walls Maybe we could, say with honesty, things said so often as drunken, empty words. Maybe we could Maybe we could find something to be for each other But for now I think I am too tired to be Maybe we could, find something to value instead of things we're supposed to be against. Maybe we could be a little richer now that we are welfare's offered blood. Maybe we could Maybe we could find something to be for each other... Kim, you asleep? Ulla. Ulla. Let's go. Kim, you need to go home. You can't fucking sleep here. - Where the hell are the others? - They left long ago. - Oh Christ. - Calm down, it's all right. - Is that you, Kim? - Yes. Kim, you have to get up. It is 7 o'clock. Kim, wake up! What a time for you to come home! It is 7 and I have to go. We have to talk when I get home. Shit! - It was a great party yesterday, huh? - Yes... You were drunk. - You held back! - You drank whiskey? - Yes, I had a little whiskey. - I only drank lager. Where did you go with Susy? Get in the sack with her? - I can't remember. - Yes, you were and fucking. - Where did you go with Kirsten? - I only finger-fucked her. She just laid there and said: "Oh, Oh." One suffers selfish pigs. Then after did not even fuck. - She is very sweet... - Who? - Susi. Yes, she's very nice. - You coming? - Yes, I'm coming now. 30 seconds then out in the schoolyard. - Aren't you in bed yet? - No. - Was it a good party? - Uh-huh. - What are you doing? - I can't figure it out. - Which one's holding you up? - It's part 2. "A customer-supplied shares in 5000 dollars " "The price 242.50." "The bill bearing the cost to seal and..." What that? Fees. Fees? And what that? - It says here. - "Fees paid by..." Don't you count on some such? There must be an example. - I'll just copy Ole. - Isn't that cheating? No, we do all the time. I wanted to learn something. Spanish, for example. Why Spanish? It can be useful. You need to shave. You are starting to get beard. Want to finish this? - Yeah - I'm going to bed. Mom? Does John like me? Do you want to take a ride with us on Sunday? Yeah, maybe. Sleep well. "Get 400 kroner in cash. Meet me at work. Mum." - Are you coming to Erling? - No, I'm going to town for my mother. I have to get some money at the bank. What about tonight? He's alone at the house. - We can drink some lager. - I have to ask. - Yeah, yeah. - Okay - Bye - Good. 824,469. 824,469. - How do you want it? - It doesn't matter. Hey! Listen Up! This is a robbery! Everyone sit down with hands over your heads! Nobody panic! And hands off the alarms! Come on. Hurry up! And you stay seated! Are we all there? Yes, get down! Come on, man! It takes only a moment! - What's going on here? - Come on, hands over your head! Hands off the phone! Keep those kids quiet! I said no alarms! Keep the hands off! Who was it? I should pay you back for that! Finish up now, man! It's all your fault! Okay, We got to get going! Up! You two! Come on! Every one else stay down! Now move like hell! There will be no way! There's been a bank robbery. A Morris Marina drove away. There are the fucking police. Move it! Shut up and come on! Move it! - What were you thinking? - Thinking? There was no time to think! - What would you have done? - I don't know. - It's not a real kidnapping. - What is it then? Shut up and drive the car! Duck! Damn it! Get down! Damn it! Watch out, there are red lights. You'd better stop. - Steen, you're crazy! - They're all right, it's fun, huh? It is, isn't it? Where are you taking us? We have a country house. Swimming pool, everything. - What's your name? - Kim. - Want my name? - Yeah. - Marianne. - So give me the key! - Yes, yes. Take the kids! Friends... We are 179,080 kroner richer. And then we have tea, huh? Nobody said I was babysitting and giving soda pops, did they? What's going to happen... with me and Kim? Nothing to worry about. We'll figure it out in the morning. Just you behave! Why didn't you bring the lager? Is that all you care about? Did you board over the windows? Yes, there are boards over the whole shit. Anyone comes by, they'll think we have plague. - Wouldn't want them to get away. - Viggo, you're too stupid to listen to. Do you need any more to eat? Now I'll show you where to sleep. Come. "Radioavisen. The search for the offenders... "who abducted two school pupils during a bank robbery at ?rnevej,..." "concentrated in the area south of Golden Gate Bridge..." "Police in Maribo took..." - They are searching in Los Angeles! Do you believe everything they say on the radio? Don't you think they know you'll have your head glued to the radio? In. What should we do? I don't know. Police will find us soon enough. You think? They have to. Marianne, don't go to sleep. Marianne, Marianne, don't sleep. I'm so tired. Marianne... Marianne! What time is it? The others are getting up now. Now what? If they come in, pretend to be asleep. - We're locked in. - But they haven't done anything to us. - Why'd you go to sleep so fast? - I don't know. Will the police keep looking? Yes, of course. I've got it! They must have put something in our tea. I knocked over my glass. Remember? - How old are you, anyway? - 15. I thought you were older. Is that all? Shut up, man. - How old are you? - I'm also 15. You think there'll be a ransom? I don't know. What would they get? My mother has no damn money. Sshh. I think they're coming. If you want breakfast, get it now. See to it now and get up. We should get up now, I guess. Something to eat? Huh? Then come. Come on over and sit. We must keep you a few days. You can walk around the house. It won't pay to run away. What happens if we try? What happens if you try? Don't try. Or we tie you up, and then you'll sit, like this: - Did you sleep well? - Keep your hands off! I'm going to town today. We need to talk later. I'm getting the tickets and picking up a crate of beer. And you clean up the shit. And keep away from Marianne. And cut some firewood. And watch the fucking kids! We've lifted 200,000 bucks, and we have to chop wood! - Where'd Steen go? - What's it to you? Just hang around. What do you have? I can't play cards. Of course you can play cards. Anyone can play cards. Viggo, take it easy! Don't go beyond the tiles. - What are you doing? - Keeping an eye on the kids. What are you doing? Weren't you supposed to chop wood? And you haven't cleaned up. You're not mature enough for this. - And where's the boy? - I'm here. Where are you going? - Out to chop wood. - Can I come? - Isn't it a bit wet? - No, it's good enough. - It won't burn. - It will too! - Is it your house? - What are you, dumb? - It's not your car? - No, it's also borrowed. - You're not very good at that. - Want to try, do you? - Yes. - Come here. Just let me get my fingers away. It's you who's never done it before, huh? Stand with legs spread. So if it slips, it goes between. - Have you done it before? - Bank robbery? No, if we had it wouldn't have all gone to shit like this. When I think, of all we'd checked... Try and take a second. We had planned the whole shit. Knew how we were to do it. We knew the wagon to use. And then it goes all to piss. - You got the money. - Yes, and two kids to go with it. - What will you do with us? - Nothing. I tell no tales before we are out of the country. How are you going? Think I'm so dumb as to tell you? That's getting us nowhere. Better let me. Why'd you steal the money? Haven't you ever stolen anything? A 10'er from the mother's purse to buy condoms, huh? - It is not the same. - Tell me the difference. People have money in the bank. What about them? At the bank, it's all insured. - Want a smoke? - Yeah. - Got a sweet mother? - Yes, she is very sweet. - And your father? - They're divorced. Same as always. As with the money. It's the system. - System? - Yeah, society, right? You could get money a different way. - How? - At the welfare office. - At the welfare office. Ha-ha, I will tell you something... Lene and me wanted a house... and we went to borrow some money. What you think the welfare office said? "You can get a one-room". You can't live on the money the rest of your lives, can you? - No, we can't. - Want me to cut some more? No, we better be getting in. Here, hold out your hands. Listen... You're up to you neck in shit. You just don't know it yet. Then there are 10,000 to you. 10,000 to you and Marianne. - And to me? - And Kim. - Oops! - Yes, now the money's wet. Marianne, just move my six. - Here, Kim. Have you played this before? - Yes, yes. - With real money? - No, hardly. These cars are made of plastic. But we can buy a decent car. 3... it is a good one. 320 kroner. It is Nygade. Kim, now you have to pull yourself together, eh? Viggo, it is your turn... into hell. - What should I pay? - 950. Then me. 10... No, Viggo can't move a damned thing. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. "Take your chance:" "Go to Jail." - Where the fuck's my car? - You're wasted, eh? - Now, I think you should go to bed. - No, not yet. Yeah, you are fucking full. Even you, Marianne.. ...looks now to get in bed with you. But I play on. Then jerk... This is not the car. It's yellow. You know, Lene? Soon we'll be in Mallorca. - I go straight ahead, right? - Hm? Viggo, get up now, you pain. Kim, Kim, wake up. Kim. - What is it? - We must get away from here. Do you know what will happen if the police come? Just listen to me! We must go. We can't count on them if the police come. You must understand that, Kim! Kim. Fuck! What are you doing? What the piss? - Haven't you slept? - Not very much. I heard them arguing. - Can you see anything? - Steen is on the sofa. Take a look. Piss, it's freezing. Haven't you thought, what if the police come? - What are you afraid of? - Come and see! Here's a gap. Let me see it again. Ow! I can't get it. Let me help you. - Locked. - Window. Run like hell! Kim! Kim! Fucking kids! Kim, damn it, come back! You don't know what you're doing! Kim, come on back! Fucking kids! Wait! - Stop, damn it! - Come on. Why are you running that way? You don't know where we are. Are you stupid? What will you do now? I'm done listening to your ideas. - Want to swim over? - Ugh, it's disgusting! Free as ancient riddles Volatile as a hare foot soaked in dew and misty droplets a moment in my spring break manifests itself as a goddess desirable, but so brief... ...is the love I will win here if I squander her away. What the fuck? There's no one home. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Think they'll come back? Maybe they have a phone. I just want something warm. You have a hole in your pants. Yeah, so? - You want a bite? - No... But I really want a bath. Shut up, man. Here it is! This is fucking delicious. What the fuck you looking at? You. Who else? You took the only towels. Are you always so rough? Why are you standing there? It would be nice to have some beer and some music, huh? Can't cope without it? Sure I can. Hey, stay right there. I have an idea. Port wine. - Port wine? - Yes. Cheers. It says port wine. What is this, lemonade? Cheers. You're sweet. - Hi. - Hey... We're all right here, right? For a few days. - Here? Right here? - Yes. It'd be rotten to go home now, right? We'd be forced to say where they were ...Steen and the others. We have to call home, right? Maybe just write a letter? We have no money. Yes, I have the 400 kroners from the bank. I'll go out and get food or find something. There is someone there. - What is it? - I think there there's someone. Have you seen my Dad? Dad? Hey!... Come on down! Well, having fun, huh? Come inside, sit down and relax. Take off your shoes. My dad is crazy about his white oak flooring. My name is Morten. And you? - Kim. - Marianne. You said there was no one... - Are you alone? - We were just passing... It's his father's house. What the fuck are you doing here? They were passing by! It's fine! Relax, man. Sit down. Have a smoke? - Will you have a smoke? - Yeah. Let's unpack and set up. Do you ever think about what you put in your mouth? Listen: Sugar, vegetable, gelling agent, citric acid... ...preservatives, food coloring. I don't want anything. All of the micro-macro overpriced commercialized crap. Will your father come, or... Should we be here alone? No, we'd be right out and screwed if he did. I think he is in Italy with a new girlfriend. Dinner ? la carte. Red wine. He has enough money. Besides, we are not alone. We're together, fuck. - Where'd you come from? - We fled. Fled? From what? - From someone who robbed a bank. - Are you kidding us? We've been running all day. Ah! You were on television! There's a 200 kroner reward. - We were on television? - Yes. They're looking all over for you. Why not go home? You're not in trouble. We could... But I won't go home. I became good friends with one. If we go home, they'll press us to say where they were. We should just wait a couple days. So they can get away, right? How many kroners were there? It was something like 200 thousand. Are you crazy, man! They could go live South America the rest of their lives. 200,000 is nothing. You could get a one-room at best. You are an idiot if you think you can buy an entire life with money. - It's a nice place, my father has. - I think that's enough. It's very nice when the fire's going. - 200,000 in real bills? - Yes, they were in stacks. - You didn't score some of them? - I could have, when we played Monopoly. - Monopoly... with real bills? - Yes. - Yeah. - That's cool. - They have guns? - Yes, a shotgun. - And a pistol, a para... - Parabellum. - Take a look at this. - Shut up, man. - How did you get it from? - I found it. - It won't shoot, will it? - No, it's just nice to have. Heaven, once again is blue the woods are full, of light and life And that sometimes disappears And I will not be afraid for tomorrow is too far away to fear And that sometimes disappears came and tarry here and now that is why I am here and you are too And that sometimes disappears and if I say, I Love You, you may doubt that it is true And that sometimes disappears. The State should buy bikes and leave them at the stations. Then all the people can come and take them. and when they've done leave them for others. They do that in France, right? I fucking doubt it. Here in Denmark, some who have tried to do it. Using old bicycles. Then they put them out. So they're public bicycles anyone could use them. While others speed around on mopeds, because they're brainwashed. I like riding mopeds. - Why? - It's just fun. We'd like a car and a moped comes closest. Why do you need a moped? Why not a bike? A bicycle is all that most people ever need. What if it's far to go? Then you can borrow a moped. Then you need people who have mopeds. And you also criticize them. You could have common mopeds. You could also have common cars. - Yes, common cars. - And some have 3 houses. You only need one house. Why have houses stand empty? Making the same trip, in two runs. So that each house has his stuff. But the young like us have to do it differently... Why the young? - Else it'll never change. - Why not? That's the adult influence. Leave it to an adult it will never get done. Just like your moped... Sit down at my side, you if you are timid and afraid sing about the old world where the old have all the power. Sit down at my side, you if you want to see something so fair let us sit and sing about it as we are hunted and on the run Sit down at my side, you I know there are more than just us who'd love to be playing or singing, but are forced to flee or to fight what we see in our dreams, comrade what'll we see in better days in our dreams we have the fat comrade when we wake up we're going to stay... what we see in our dreams, comrade what we'll see in better days in our dreams we have the fat comrade when we wake up we're going to stay... Just think, we could be in school, now... doing a stupid writing exercise or something. Think of them sitting and working. It's great. - Do you remember standing in to the bank? - Yeah. - What were you thinking then? - I don't know. I remember you looked at me a bit. Then you turned your head away. Because you looked at me. It was as if I had seen you before. Like a light in your eye every time you looked up. Let me try that. It's expensive, don't break it. You keep it. I don't need to wear it anymore. Thanks. Sshh, the other sleep. - They snore so. - Like frogs. - No, the hell, man! - Ow, ow. - Kim, you have any money? - Yes, 400 kroner. Great! Let's buy some flour and some yeast. - What do you bake? - Some bread. - Why not just buy bread? - That's not worth shit. I would like some coffee. A little kiss for you. And this is for you. - Why are you so happy? - I have had a good morning. - Kings and Prince. - 20 of each? Yes, you have enough. [ NO SIGNS OF KIDNAPPED CHILDREN ] And this one. Let us see how much it is. It will be 95 kroner So let's have candy for the last. Enough for 5 pieces of chocolate. Erik, give me the Ekstra Bladet. ( tabloid newspaper ) - Can you imagine? - Look at the picture. No, it's not you. You can't believe all the shit they put in newspapers. What the hell is that? It's an alarm clock I scored. After all we've talked about! What the fuck for? What do we need with time? We decide for ourselves when we go to bed and when to get up. - No, it's for damn fools! - I know damn well! Fuck, what are you doing? - I train. - For what? - Karate. - That's no fucking karate. - It is such a thing here. - Relax first off. Take off the sweater and I'll show you what karate is. First, you learn exercises and breathing. Now I show you some exercises. - It's piss cold! - Baby! No pouring water on the head! I think the others have gone down to the farm for a few eggs. Hold it steady. - Do you want sugar? - No thanks. Good, because there is none. It was lucky there was tea. Have you ever tried to make tea before? If it's no good, then you can make it. Do you think we can see each other, after we go back? Or do you have someone? No, I don't. - But it doesn't matter, does it? - No, no. Perhaps we could go on a weekend trip? Well, we're here now. I never bothered to talk of it, I have tried it too often, piss. Just when we had it all together... ...then I was moved into child protection. They should have children's homes all over the place. Then children could stay together. Then children could gain a little more confidence. They could live in the children's houses. How can children feel secure? They would learn to trust themselves. You learn the opposite at school. There you learn to never trust youself and you're never good enough. Hey, don't, jerk! That's our man. It should be like this house... Police! Police! - I can just talk to them. - Talk to whom, man? Come on now! Don't run! Keep them 10 minutes to give us a chance. - Where're you going? - See you! The end is near the curtain falls look when you're alone and look when you are gone drink in for a moment from this clear spring for you have been as free as ever you can so stay in Dannevang for now you become a media event tomorrow will never come, some tell you but you became friends, before that had to be they wave to you, wanting for you to be... free... completely free only a time so brief, unbound, without the grind, yes, live, live,... completely live tomorrow you'll be free of utopia for tomorrow... will come never.
