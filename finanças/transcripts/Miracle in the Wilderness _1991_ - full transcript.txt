[drumbeats] [bird squawking] [tribesmen singing] [crow cawing] [singing continues] [birds chirping] [melodic music] [water flowing] [music continues] [water dripping] [singing continues] [drumbeats] [horse neighs] [birds chirping] [crow cawing] [snarling] [melodic music] [music continues] [gun clocks] [drumbeats] Morning, chief. Your dog watches poorly. (male #1) 'No, he knew you was here before I did...like the Shoshone.' - Sees much, but speaks little. - You taught him well. I figure Sam Webster must be about. Speak of the devil, and he appears. Good thing you didn't pull that trigger, Jericho. Killin' the chief, there'd be a sure way to get his wives after your scalp. What're you gawking at? What the hell did you do to your face? You look like a damned skinned bear. Look at that, chief. Slicker than a baby's butt. [Sam laughing] What're you doing this far up? Indian trouble. Patrols about a mile back. [sighs] Blackfeet. You've seen him? Just figures in the Shoshone riding scout. Yeah. Blackfoot raiding party kickin' up around the Wind river. We've been chasing 'em a week. Chief Many Horses. You track him this way? It only started, that storm last night wiped out any good trail. Yeah, probably up in Canada by now. There ain't no sense standin' around here in the cold. Come on home and get warm. What did I do to deserve that invitation? Haul that tree. Won't make much of a fire. It ain't for burning, you paganist. It's for decorating. - It's a Christmas tree. - Hmm, it's that time again? (Jericho) Sure as hell, ain't the Fourth of July. (Sam) Well, you know, I'll tote the tree for you. And not because you might give a frozen man some whiskey, no sir! Just to see if your wife's had a good sense to leave you by now. We have a son. Chief, you and the boys are welcome. - 'Come on, young man.' - 'Hee-haw!' - 'Hah! - 'Hah! Hah!' (Sam) 'Come on, damn. What're you waiting for?' (Jericho) I'm waiting for my horse. [folk music] (Sam) Holy Smoke! [indistinct chatter] [cocks gun] (Sam) Now, quit complaining. It's warmer down there. (Jericho) Yeah, at least you can fix yourself a warm fire. [folk music continues] [dog barking] Miss Dora. We didn't except to see you here this time of the year, sergeant. I was just passin' through. I have to say, ma'am, that motherhood mightily agrees with you. 'You're prettier than the first day I'd seen you.' Well, thank you, sergeant. That's a quite a compliment. Now, I don't want any mud dragged in...by anybody. You said she was feisty. Indoor's, her say, outdoor's mine. (Sam) Bet you don't get indoors much. Well, down snow was about 70 feet deep. An entire herds of buffalo were frozen solid standing up. 'Now, come spring fall.' 'We skinned 'em, threw 'em in the Salt Lake' and pickled them, had enough meat for ten years. [laughing] (Jericho) 'That tale gets bigger every time I hear.' That was nothin'. Compared to that time, we spent in that blizzardness at Shoshone camp. 'Yeah, most of it in Washakie's Lodge.' You remember when we stumbled in there, Jericho? Ah-ha. Well, Sam. Well, go on, it sounds exciting. Well. You see, Jericho's feet, they were so frost bit. 'He was afraid we weren't gonna be able to keep 'em attached.' Jericho, are you sure, you don't want to tell her the story? Sam. (Dora) Jericho, I wanna hear this. Please. You mean to say that he never told you how Washakie saved them, tortured feet of his? No, and I ain't telling her now. Well, you see, there was, uh, this pretty Indian girl. You-you recall her name, Jericho? No, neither do you. No matter. You know, humanitarian type. You know, willing and able to share her warmth 'to keep Jericho's froze body intact!' Now, the next morning, a-a blessed miracle! [laughing] He-he could walk. Talk about your thaw. [Sam chuckling] Sam, so help me, God, one of these days I'm gonna skin you alive. Oh, Jericho Adams, them was shinin' times. Shinin' times. [Sam laughing] Well, I'm just thankful to the Lord that she was there. And willing to help. That's a real special woman you got there, Jericho. I'll even up with you, later. [Sam laughing] We'll be needing another jug. We've gotta decorate that tree. By the time you finish, supper will be ready. [gasps] [instrumental music] Oh, damn, I forgot. Oh, excuse me for the blasphemy, ma'am. This is Wa-Washakie himself. Chief of the Shishone. Sam and my husband told me 'that you took them to your village once.' I-I'm...I'm very grateful. [hoof-beats approaching] (Sam) There is lieutenant, how did he get here so fast? (Jericho) Well, this fun's over now. [shouting] On right. In a line! We're still on patrol, sergeant. Oh, damn, I forg.. I forgot. Well, you know, whiskey does that to you. Uh, lieutenant, say hello here to Miss Dora and-and J-Jericho Adams. Ma'am. Pleasure. Heard many stories about you from the sergeant. So has my wife. I assume Sgt. Webster has told you what we're doing. We could use your help tracking the raiding party. (Lieutenant) 'Word is Many Horses is leading them.' I put killin'behind me a long time ago, lieutenant. I'm a peaceable man now. Chief, lieutenant, would you care to join us for dinner? Oh, certainly, ma'am. [harmonica music] [indistinct chatter] [trumpet blowing] (Jericho) 'That's enough out of you.' Well, Jericho, you used to tell jokes so dirty that mortified Ted Preacher two canyons away. Now, look at you. Farmin', married to a Church-goin' woman. There ain't a Church within a 100 miles from here. Hell, we bring it with 'em. They always do. First, it's the whiskers next thing you know-- - Don't say. - Be planting things in rows. Haven't I said anything to offend you yet? You have. [laughing] 'That's more like it.' What did I say, anyway? [hen clucking] You called me a farmer. Oh! Well, that was rotten. They're full of manure. I'm a rancher. Hell, ranching's for damn Texans. Ranchin', farming. What the hell is the difference what it is you call what you think you're doing? Ooh. Gentlemen. You are from the East, aren't you, ma'am? Pennsylvania. Not far from Philadelphia. - 'And you, lieutenant?' - New York, ma'am. Graduated from West Point there, last year. When it comes to shooting this boy knows the difference between bull and cow. [indistinct chatter] (Jericho) 'Lucky, I didn't take your scalp right there at the table.' Cake? Lieutenant. Certainly, ma'am. Go on, tear him. (Sam) 'Now, that's more like you used to be.' - Gentlemen, would you mind? - Hmm. Oh, not at all, ma'am. Anything you care to play. [indistinct chatter] 'Use your damn head, for a change.' Wait, wait. Whiskey, come on. Whiskey. [sneezing] [Singing "It Came Upon The Midnight Clear"] * It came upon the midnight clear * [Sam laughing] Looks like you could use some of this. * It came upon the midnight clear * You don't punch as hard as you used to. * From angels bending near the earth * * To touch their harps of gold [grunting] [soldiers chattering] (Jericho) It ain't the first time.. * The world in solemn stillness lay * * To hear the angels sing * [both grunting] (Jericho) Help, put me down, damnit. (Dora) Stop it! Stop it! - Stop it! - 'No! Dora!' We're just finishin' up, ma'am. (Jericho) 'That's right. We're finished.' Finished you are? Along with everything else. Now, wash up! Dinner's ready. - 'Hell, that was good.' - 'She gave a lam, didn't she?' (Sam) 'I'm tellin' you, it ain't like it used to be.' (Sam) You know, that they say these mountains are the closest thing there is to heaven. The trouble is, word's spreadin'. Now, you got your missionaries and preachers trekking up here. All along with...the mighty words and holy water. Hey.. ...chief, don't let 'em go baptizing you now, you hear? [harmonica music] Yep, first it's the preachers. Then, it's the farmers and lawyers and such. Bringing trains and black smoke. Fences.. ...spoiling all our fun. (Sam) 'We're gonna lose it all.' 'It's all gonna be gone one day, chief.' You miss the old days? Not even the good ones. And they were far between. I got more than I ever expected, right now. You know, you listen to Sam you think the world's coming to an end. [sighs] It is for them. Sam and the Indians. Gettin' smaller every day. Ain't gonna be much wilderness left soon. One day, it'll all be civilized. Is it so bad, Jericho? Just different. You lived your whole life one way and then everything changes. And suddenly, you don't belong, and you got no place to go. You know what scares Sam more than anything else? No. The thought that he's gonna climb to the top of the last piece of wilderness. Guess what he's gonna find there? What? A brand new Church with a preacher lecturing him how to live the rest of his life. A woman? If he's lucky. [instrumental music] I heard that lieutenant sayin' that.. ...that Blackfoot Chief.. ...that you and him are old enemies. Many Horses. [whispers] Many Horses. Yeah, we've gone at it. That was a long time ago. Chasing him is gonna be like chasing the wind. Either take him up or only the hawk can drown. And that's where they'll stay. Until it dawns. While Many Horses is sitting in his lodge with his wives. [chuckles] Poor, Sam. It's worth nursing babies. [instrumental music] What if they need you? Sam's as good as they come. [kite screeching] Well, look at you. Christmas trees, warm corner. Pitch fork. I hope that means you're envying me. Guess. [wind howling] Keep your eyes skinned. And you. [dramatic music] Draw sabers. Present arms. 'Carry arms.' Return sabers. Two. Two's left. From the right. [music continues] I'm sorry, he's not joining us, sergeant. Even me, lieutenant. You might have tried to convince him. I know, I might be crazy to do this job but you don't gotta be stupid. He's got the best of all worlds right there and he's not gonna go spend god knows, how many days in the saddle you get snowed off. [instrumental music] [dog barking] [music continues] Was straightening out the barn. Looked like a grizzly bear and a jack ass went at each other. Well, everything's alright now. Asher's still hasn't been baptized. I've been thinking about that. I'll tell you what. If it'd make you happy. I'll take the little fella out to the creek, dunk him myself. [baby babbling] Hell, I'll jump in with him. I think there's more than that Jericho, there's also the words. You ever listened to the wind and those tall pines out there? If there is an Almighty, maybe that's Him talking. Girl, I'll do anything you ask. You wanna worship polar bears, I'll trek north, fetch you one. All the people passing through here there's bound to be a preacher sooner or later. [baby coughs] Dash some water on the little fellow's brow with the proper words, of course. [baby cooing] You're a good man, Jericho Adams. I guess you're right, ma'am. [whimpering] [whimpering continues] Jackson, what is it? [horse neighing] [snarling] Probably some critter bothering the horses. Why don't you put him to bed, I'll go take a look. [horse neighing] [snarling] I'll be right on. [baby coughing] Easy, Jackson. [wind howling] If you hear a ruckus bolt the door. [intense music] Do like I say. There's a pistol in that drawer. Load it. Stay Jackson. [gun cocks] [gunshot] [indistinct yelling] [grunting] [whooping] [music continues] [shuddering] I'll shoot. Jackson, get out of here! Run to the damn door! [clicks] [intense music] [glass shattering] [grunting] [whooping continues] [all grunting] [baby crying] Get away. [drumbeats] [baby crying] (Sam) 'They're burnin' Jericho's place.' Damn! Lieutenant! - Turn the men around. - What is it, Sergeant? - They set fire to Jericho. - What? (Sam) Lieutenant, that's more than half a day's ride! Turn around, lieutenant. - Right now-- - Turn 'em around! Follow me! [trumpet blowing] [intense music] (Jericho) That's Brave riding with the Chief. Who is he? (Jericho) 'I heard the others call him, Grey Eyes.' 'Riding with the Chief makes him important.' 'And that means, his son.' 'Looks like they're taking us north to the border.' You lost a lot of strength. Don't do anything foolish. [dramatic music] [music continues] Not a sign of them. - Blackfeet? - Many horses. There. Jackson! Jackson, boy. Yeah, yeah, you stupid dog. Jonathan, come here, take care of this dog. [dog howling] [speaking in native dialect] Many horses. Take everybody. - Where? - Big Horn. (Sam) 'They're making a run to Canada.' Why would they take a woman and a baby? [native dialect] Fall in! [indistinct chatter] My husband! He's hurt! You stay. Listen, darling, don't move. [grunts] [whooping] [chattering in native dialect] [whooping continues] [grunting] [intense music] I'll cut his throat. Let us go or I'll kill your son. You have already killed my son. My only son. (Washakie) 'Four winters ago.' [laughing] [horses galloping] [horse neighing] (Sam) Blackfeet burial ground. It's a custom when a warrior dies that his favorite horse the one he rides on a buffalo honoring raid stays with him until his soul passes. They cover their dead with rocks so the wolves don't get 'em. Losing their dead behind means they're moving fast. I'm afraid the Shoshone will be no.. ...no use to us anymore, lieutenant. Why? At a Blackfeet burial ground crossing it would be desecrating. - It could come back on 'em. - Tell them to ride around it. Lieutenant, we could be in St. Louis by the time we skirted this canyon. - I'll talk to them. - Don't waste your breath. They got their beliefs same as we got ours. Maybe more. Many Horses figured planting them here would stop the Shoshones. Ain't no doubt that old coyote's still Chief. Then, leave him behind. Forward march! [instrumental music] (Dora) You killed his son? (Jericho) I don't know. (Dora) You don't know? (Dora) How many men have you killed? (Jericho) A few. I just don't know if his son was amongst them. I never killed anyone I didn't have to, Dora. It's the way it was out here. It ain't civilized. [whooping] [speaking in native dialect] [continues speaking in native dialect] They saw blue coats coming. At least, a day's ride behind us. [speaking in native dialect] (Dora) 'What is Grey Eyes saying?' [native dialect] He want us to go back and ambush. But Many Horses' ain't buyin' it. He figures, they're too far back to make any difference. We're gettin' too close to Blackfeet country, girl. Once we're over the border, no army's gonna come to get us out. Don't try anything else, Jericho. Please. [speaking in native dialect] [whooping] [whooping continues] (Dora) Is this their village? (Jericho) The whole tribe's over 3000. (Jericho) It's a supply camp set up for raiding parties. [whooping continues] Probably, looks like we'll be spending the night here. (Jericho) 'In the morning, they head north for Canada.' (Jericho) It ain't that far, girl. [tribal music] [speaking in native dialect] Where four years ago? Teton river. I was trappin' beaver. Three braves came at me out of nowhere. I didn't know one of 'em was your son. They were hunting for furs only. In that country, everyone was looking for furs. Indian and white men, but no one was talkin'. It was Blackfoot land. (Jericho) 'And who is to say what land belongs to who?' Don't the Blackfeet believe that no man can own the land anymore than he can own the sky or the air we breathe? That was a long time ago. Why'd you wait to come after me? Now, you have a son. No! Little Deer can have no more children. Your son will be my son. (Washakie) 'A great warrior because he carries your blood.' A great leader because I will guide him as my own. No, he's our son. Give her the child. 'Give her the child.' Or he will die. There's no fighting it, Dora. No, no, Jericho. He can kill me first. - They will. - But.. Me too for trying to stop him. - Let go. - No! - Listen to me, Dora. - No! [sobbing] No, no! They won't hurt him. (Jericho) 'It's the only chance we've got.' Give him to me. [baby crying] [crying continues] What do you plan to do with us? You know.. ...don't you? Tell me. Tell me. You are a handsome woman. 'Young and strong.' 'Can have plenty sons.' He will die. 'Death of a great warrior.' Blackfeet have waited long...for this day. Tell Thompson to get a fire going in that clearing there. How long we rest around, lieutenant? These men just stopped, sergeant. The only reason we stopped is to light these fires and tempt the Blackfoot scouts up there watching everything we do, they see the smoke from these fires-- - These men are tired. - No more tired than Blackfeet. Sergeant, I'm in command here and I'm not running these men into the ground. They won't be any good to anyone if they don't get some rest. They can get it on the next patrol, sir. Lieutenant, that family's only chance is us. 'If Many Horses figures we're bedding down for the night' he will too. [soldiers chattering] - Mount up. - 'Oh.' We're moving out. Balance my horse. Potter, Jonathan, you two stay behind and keep these fires going. I want you to follow up in four hours. 'Yeah.' (Lt. Reid) 'Is that necessary?' Just warming the bones, lieutenant. (lieutenant) Suggest you button up your coat instead. [speaking in native dialect] Soldiers stopped somewhere down the mountain. 'It'll be daybreak before they can find a trail.' (Jericho) 'They're sending barracks Braves to slow 'em down.' Many Horses figures we'll be in Blackfeet country by then. - Jericho. - Don't worry. They're saving me for something special. [speaking in native dialect] [thunder rumbling] [wind howling] [horses neighing] [thunder rumbling] [melodic music] [speaking in native dialect] What are they saying? They don't understand the deer birthing in winter. It always happens in the spring. (Chief Washakie) 'Why doesn't the deer run away?' [speaking in a native dialect] Deer do not move. Dora? It's the miracle of Christmas, Jericho. What is your woman saying? It was on this night that the only son of god was born. [chattering in native dialect] And the animals came to worship. And they were given the power to speak. What did they say? They prayed for protection. From the wolves and from the hunter. [melancholic music] [music continues] [chattering in native dialect] [chattering in native dialect continues] The deer spoke to you. What is this spirit? What God does your woman worship? There is only one God. - Yours. - 'Ours.' To all people. The great spirit.. ...lights our fires. The earth is our mother. We do not fear your god. But he is not to be feared. He is a good god. The white man's god is good to the white man. To all men. Then he is angry because the Blackfeet take your son? Yes. He's very angry. No. [disgusted sigh] We are all his children and he loves us all. And why has he chosen to come here? I will tell you. [chattering in native dialect] [continues speaking in native dialect] You can buy us some time. They think there's something magical going on here. There is, Jericho. Uh-huh. (Dora) 'It is written in the Bible, the book of God.' 'In a land far away..' '...where the snow, never flies.' In the village of Nazareth.. ...lived a young girl named Mary. Who is to marry a man called Joseph. [translating in native dialect] [melancholic music] [continues translating in native dialect] [music continues] [distant hoof-beats] [whooping] (Dora) 'Joseph was a good man, a carpenter.' (Jericho) 'He was a brave and a great hunter.' (Dora) 'Mary was 14, chaste and pure of heart.' [melodic music] [music continues] [indistinct chatter] (Dora) 'Joseph's love for Mary was honorable.' 'He knew, one day she would be his wife.' Then one day, came an angel from God. A.. ...a-a winged messenger. Eagle. An eagle. [eagle squawking] (Dora) 'And the angel told Mary, she was to have a son.' 'And that son would be the son of God.' [Chief translating in native dialect] [baby crying] Give him to me. [shouting in native dialect] Let me go. I want my baby. [speaking in native dialect] Let me go. I want my baby. [indistinct yelling] Dora, listen to me. Listen to me! The baby is alright. And we're alive. And we won't be, if you do that again. Do you understand? [panting] [chattering in native dialect] [speaking in a native dialect] You can't stop now. It's our only chance. [distant barking] [panting] Alright? (Reid) 'How far are they from the border?' (Sam) 'Half a day. Jericho will find a way of slow 'em down now.' (Reid) 'If he's still alive.' (Sam) 'There's one thing Jericho's good at, it's staying alive.' How long have you been fighting these Indians? Fighting? Oh, about half my life. Spent the other half living with them. You ever worry they might slit your throat one night. Just because you are a white man? They're fighting to hold onto what's theirs, same as we are. [gunshots and whooping] On your knees. Get down. Get down! [indistinct yelling and continuous firing] [whooping] [firing continues] Keep your head down, lieutenant. The Blackfeet are good with a bow, as any man with a gun. [whooping] Damn, they can shoot. [continuous firing] His son.. This Joseph was a strong man. The son.. ...was not Joseph's. And she was with child before her marriage to him? That brings great shame to her and her family. (Dora) 'It did.' 'Mary was with child by the holy spirit.' 'But her people did not believe.' 'And they shun them.' (Chief Washakie) 'Did they move their lodge?' (Jericho) 'Yes, they had to move away from the village.' (Dora) 'But Mary was a virgin.' And the child was God's son. Did Joseph believe this? Yes. [laughing] [speaking in native dialect] [all laughing] Then he was a fool. And an angel appeared before him in a dream and said "fear not to take unto you Mary, for your wife. For that which is conceived in her, is the holy spirit." [melodic flute music] (Jericho) 'Joseph wanted to believe.' 'But like his people, he couldn't.' 'So he prayed to the great spirit for an answer.' [flute music continues] [crickets chirping] [melancholic music] Joseph! [speaking in a native dialect] [music continues] [thunder rumbling] (Jericho) 'He came to him one night' 'and his doubts were finally answered.' [music intensifies] [thunder rumbling] [neighing] [thunder rumbling] [speaking in native dialect] [gunshot] [speaking in a native dialect] Get the baby. [speaking in a native dialect] Jericho. We're leaving. [intense music] You will not go far. Neither will you. [cocks gun] [gunshots] [firing continues] [chattering in native dialect] [music continues] [gunshot] (Dora) 'Jericho!' 'Are you alright?' Dora, keep riding. Go on. Get out of here. No. [grunting] [speaking in a native dialect] [baby crying] [grunting and groaning] Jericho. [chattering in native dialect] (Dora) 'Jericho, no.' [grunting and groaning continues] Jericho! You're killing him. Stop it, Jericho. Stop it. No. In God's name, stop it! Oh, let him go, Jericho. Jericho. Jericho, let him go. 'Let him go.' Please. Please. [panting] Let me help you. [distant howling] [speaking in a native dialect] (Jericho) 'Many horses is banishing Grey Eyes from the tribe.' (Dora) 'I don't understand.' (Jericho) 'He went against his chief, now he's running him out.' 'If he killed me, the young race would've followed him.' 'Now he rides alone.' [singing in native dialect] [singing continues] [speaking in a native dialect] [singing continues] [owl hooting] [crickets chirping] [distant barking] [baby cooing] [horse neighs] [distant howling] [tribesmen whooping] What is he doing? I guess word's spread, you're gonna be a widow. He's courting you. 'Chief's paying you an honor.' I-I don't understand. You stopped me from killing one of theirs. That's strange enough in any way. Let alone a woman. [whooping continues] (Jericho) 'Getting offered the best braves.' They make fine husbands. You choose. This is my husband. He will soon die. (Dora) 'We will all die.' But he will always be my husband. Your woman.. ...has great power. (Chief) 'She stops you from killing Grey Eyes.' God stopped him. God spoke to him. Why did God not speak when he killed my son? (Dora) 'Jericho was unable to hear him.' With what words.. ...does your mighty god speak.. ...that it cannot be heard? You will hear only if you believe in him. Finish the story of your god. You are hoping the soldiers are coming. If I'd figured that, I wouldn't have made such a fool move. My child. I-I want to hold him. [baby cooing] [crying] [blowing raspberry] Mountains...are for a man. Not a white woman and a child. - You're doing good, Dora. - Hm. Sharing the Christ's story with these people, Jericho.. ...I think God would want that. Well, don't go through into converting anyone. These people believe in their own god. And they're spiritual enough as it is. [chuckles] You mean more than you, don't you, Jericho? [sighs] Dora, if there is a God, I don't mind him helping. But the only one who's gonna get us out is Sam and US army. And if they don't make it? [sighs] Lieutenant, Blackfeet's scout's comin' too. indistinct chattering] [speaking in a native dialect] He says, the woman and child will be alright. And Jericho? He'll die, a warriors death. Savages. Lieutenant.. ...I've known Many Horses a long time. 'Him crossing the border out of Canada, he had his reasons.' - What? - Don't know. Jericho's buried his share of Blackfeet.. ...I guess that comes with that land. Both, he and Many Horses accept that. They're gonna be waiting for us up there, lieutenant. 'With the best they got.' Ain't no time for planning now. We just gotta get damn lucky. Fast too. Keep him warm. - Go on, now! - Oh, no. Mary and Joseph left Nazareth, for a place called Bethlehem. (Dora) 'The Roman Emperor.' (Jericho) 'The ruler of all the tribes.' (Dora) 'He ordered everyone to the town of his birth.' (Jericho) 'Like that time in the sun dance.' When the tribes gathered in the summer time. [melodramatic music] [whooping] (Dora) 'So Joseph took Mary, who was promised to him as his wife.' 'From Nazareth to his village in the land of Judea.' 'Bethlehem.' (Jericho) 'Bethlehem was across the plains.' 'And it was during the time of the great sun dance..' '...when the Indians gathered to celebrate' 'the end of winter and the start of spring.' [singing in native dialect] (Dora) 'And there was word amongst the people' 'that the only son of God was soon to be born.' [everyone laughing merrily] (Jericho) 'So the tribes had more reason to celebrate.' 'They came from the plains..' '...the mountains, the river.' 'And the deserts.' 'The Sioux from the Tetons. 'The Northern Cheyenne.' 'The Cherokee and the Creek.' 'They pitched their lodges.' 'Smoked their pipes with old friends.' 'Children played.' 'They danced to celebrate.' [speaking in native dialect] [drum music] [singing continues] [drum music continues] [singing continues] But the Christ child was born in winter. 'Girl, to the Blackfeet, summer time's heaven and winter's hell.' Go on. They travelled for many days and Mary was great with child. (Dora) 'Mary and Joseph had travelled very far.' 'But when they arrived at Bethlehem..' '...they knew no one.' 'And had no place to stay.' [melodic music] (Dora) 'And to Bethlehem came the two travelers.' 'Mary and Joseph.' 'And Mary was ready to give birth.' [music continues] 'But when her time came..' '...no one would give them shelter.' So they went to a stable. And there in the manger.. ...the infant Jesus was born. [speaking in native dialect] They did not have people in their tribes? There was no one. No one offered them their lodge? Mary had to give birth where the beasts were gathered. [speaking in a native dialect] After the child was born.. ...there was glowing in the sky. And the ox bowed down on the earth. As the deer worshipped. And he spoke.. ...as he had spoken to the deer. (Chief Washakie) 'And the other animals also talk?' Yes. What were their words? (Dora) 'They asked to be protected' 'from thirst and hunger.' 'And that we lived together in peace.' 'And love one another.' 'Then other animals came to worship.' (Chief Washakie) 'You say this child was born the son of your God.' But only animals came to worship. Well, three kings came from the East. Kings? (Jericho) 'A king leads his people, like you lead your people.' A wise man. Three wise men. (Chief Washakie) 'Wise men.' Of what tribe? One was a Teton. 'And second was Mandan and the third was Plains Cree.' The three wise men.. ...they found the child by following a star. A new star that appeared in the sky over Bethlehem. One never seen before by any man. (Dora) 'They knew, seeing that star..' '...that the king of all had been born.' [instrumental music] [baby cooing] (Dora) 'Young boys playing outside the village saw the star.' 'And they came and brought the child gifts.' [baby cooing] [music continues] [music continues] (Dora) 'The three wise men brought gifts.' (Jericho) 'The Mandan...brought a medicine bag in beaver skin.' 'The Plains Creek gave the child a bow and quiver of arrows.' 'And the Sioux...a peace pipe.' [instrumental music] [baby cooing] And what became of this child Jesus? (Dora) 'He spent his life spreading the words of his father.' (Jericho) 'A medicine man.' And what message did he bring from.. ...this great God in the heavens? That man should seek peace. And that all men are bothers. Then this is a fable. To find peace, one must believe in peace. The white man has killed Indians. 'And other white men--' Well, it was a difficult message to accept. And for it they killed his only son. He allowed his son to die? Yes, so that men could remember the love that he preached. Then he was fool. It has been this way. And it will always be this way. Survival. Is that not true? Jericho. (Washakie) 'His silence, is his answer.' Your God's son died.. ...for no reason. No, he did not. (Dora) 'The third day after his death..' ...he rose and joined his father in heaven. Then he is not dead. Not he or his message. And one day, all men will live in peace. And all men will be brothers. [hoof-beats approaching] [galloping] [indistinct chatter] [speaking in native dialect] Soldiers coming. [speaking in a native dialect] [indistinct chatter] We're not going anywhere. 'Dying fast now or slow later, it's all the same.' Jericho, please. (Jericho) 'Dora, don't move.' I killed his son and he's been waiting four years. It's between him and me. [indistinct chatter] It was a story meant for children. It will always be this way. You've lost too much blood. I've fought with worse. So have you. [drum music] [knives clanking] [chattering in native dialect] [dramatic music] [groaning and grunting] [music continues] [grunts] [music intensifies] [grunting and groaning] [grunting and groaning continues] [chattering in native dialect] [chattering continues] [tribesmen whooping] [music continues] [chattering in native dialect continues] [grunting] [horse nickering] [horse neighs] [grunts] [speaking in a native dialect] [continues speaking in native dialect] What is he saying? He's leaving me behind. 'Cause I'm wounded. I'd slow him down. It'll be a bad stretch. He didn't say anything about you and the baby. [chattering in native dialect] My wife knows the pain of having a child. And losing one. [melancholic music] Teach him well. [baby cooing] [music continues] You think? Maybe, chief. Maybe. [music continues] [chattering in native dialect] [chattering continues] [music continues] [wolves howling] [men chattering indistinctively] (male #2) 'Lieutenant, there's a camp ahead.' (Lt. Reid) 'Be careful. It could be a trap.' 'Be prepared to use your weapons.' - 'Keep your eyes peeled, boys.' - 'Go on the perimeter.' Damnit, Sam, it's just us. You look like hell. (male #3) 'I'm gonna keep look out, anyway.' 'Okay, check it out.' I thought you'd be under by now. Sorry to disappoint you. Glorious bunch of horse soldiers just scare 'em off or what? [sighs] Guess so. They just hightailed it outta here. - How long ago? - Some time yesterday. (Jericho) 'Be in Canada by now.' Well, they'll be back in the spring. We haven't seen the last of 'em. Maybe, lieutenant. Maybe not. I'll get you two some horses. Well, you're gonna tell me how you saved your hide. You know, I'd bust out of curiosity. I will. But you ain't going to believe it. Why won't I? We sat around the fire while Dora told them a story. When she was through, they packed up and left. And you expect me to believe that? (Dora) 'It's true, Sam.' That's what really happened. Must have been a heck of a tale. [deep breath] Yes, Sam, it was. Remind me to have you tell it to me. I'll remind you. I want to be there when she does. Well, quicker we leave, the quicker we get there. Anything left? [melodic music] No, it's all gone. You're starting from dirt. Well, everything except that mangy thing you call the dog. (Dora) 'Jackson.' [laughing] He's alright. We're going home, girl.
