THE BOURCHNIKOV METHOD What the hell is this mess? Where's the castle? For God's sake, you cut when I say cut! Elizabeth, pick up your teeth and let's do it again! -Ready! -Roman, the castle's gone! Screw the castle, just do the close-up. Elizabeth, more drama, damn it! Dig deep for the emotion Look, further to the left! Now look at the sea. Okay, cut! We'll finish tomorrow! Should I disappear... ROMAN GOUBRICK MISSING The Odyssey will stay a pretty photo-novel that needed updating. Why should it need an ending? I shall resist the threats from reactionary groups. I wish to thank the Academy. People talk such rubbish. There is no Goubrick mystery. There's a lot I'd like to hand on to my son. Still, he'll find his own way as they say. Alexandre Goubrick, how do you feel on seeing your father again? We'll finish the film, Dad. Tell me Alexandre, you're barely 30, you have no film experience, you've never worked, and your plan to complete this ambitious project 25 years after his death. Is genius hereditary? No, but I knew my father well. Oedipus said that before he killed his. What about the ending? I prefer not to divulge that for now. We'll respect your caution. But since you're letting our reporters follow you... We'll all see together if genius really hereditary. Crew of The Odyssey Crew of The Odyssey Cut! We'll finish tomorrow. Poor Roman. When I said on TV he was a monster... A "mangy" dog. No, that was in my book. Are you really his son? -Well, I think so. -It's funny. you're not a bit like him. Still, if you say so. All right. My first question, Elizabeth... Don't be shocked, but... your father and I fell in love right away. When he saw me, he knew I was his Penelope. I was his muse, his creature, his plaything... More drama! Dig deep for the emotion! He hated having to throw me into the sea. Penelope jumps into the sea? Yes, in the last shot... That's brilliant, but ... Homer never wrote that. The day he vanished, he came to my dressing room... He came there often. He took my hand and told me... "you're so pretty, only an idiot would let you die". You know the rest... The rest? He vanished nather than sacrifice his actress. But my dear boy, I'm ready to jump. What? How do you want to end it? Elizabeth... She said he wanted her to jump into the sea. Elizabeth? Not again? Since the first take, that crazy neurotic has longed to "die on film" and go down in history. Son, Michello Brachelloni will never partake in such a masquerade! But Michello, I thought you dreamt if finishing that movie... With Roman, dickhead, not an amateur like you! In your revolutionary ratio 1:2. 1:2,5! That's it, 1:2,5 Retinal perspective coinciding perfectly with psychic perspective! 13,000 copies sold in Italy! My best-seller! Do you know the real ending? Of course I know it! A magical ending, an innovation for Ulysse's story. The castle was to go up in flames, burning Penelope alive in an orgy of blazing red. Roman had even had the brilliant idea of setting fire to the film stock. So you see, kid, without me, you can't do a thing. So we cancel everything? You're a good kid, Alessandro, but... You're not very smart. Get the petrol can ready. Let's finish the master piece. -Are those the flames? -No, that's her dress. -So, these are the flames. -No. That's the castle. ..or her hair. That's the final frame in any case. No, it can't end like that. He wouldn't have burned his Penelope. he loved her. His vision of the Odissey was pure romance. He gave me instructions for the set. It must be... this one. The clouds vanish. The moon is replaced by a dazzling sun bathing Ulysse in a mystical light. After so long, their vibrant bodies are about to mingle their energies in a burning embrace... Enough! Does anyone have an interesting idea for the end? And I mean really interesting. For the end, I'll use the Vassili Bourchnikov method. The What? You heard, Max, old chap. The Bourchnikov method. Roman, you mean you'll... Checkmate, Roman. Just here! I don't have many options left. How'll you manage, you old devil? For the end, I'll use the Vassili Bourchnikov method. The what? you heard, Max, old chap. The Bourchnikov method. Roman, you mean you'll... Good old Roman! You came to old Max just for that? Max, what was the Bourchnikov method? Vassili Bourchnikov was a Russian chess master in the 20's the best ever, your father said. He never lost a game. But during his last tournament, he played one game too many. He was close to losing with no possible way out. Instead of admitting defeat, he risked it all. When he realized he couldn't win he went to have a smoke. He always did that before the winning move. And? He never came back. That's all. You what? I'm telling you, he just left. No one saw him again. Officially, no one beat him. He stayed the best, the greatest. That was that. The Vassili Bourchnikov method. Tragedy strikes the film The Odissey again. We have just learned that Alexandre Goubrick was lost this morning when his motorcycle hit a train while on his way to the mythical studio A. Like is father 25 years ago, he has fallen victim to a clearly jinxed film which will remain unfinished. The firemen on the scene found only a small yellow helmet and no trace of the body and no trace of the body which seems to have disintegrated on impact. Well, son... you took your time getting it. -Alex? -Yeah? Checkmate in three moves. Sorry, Dad, I'm black. -Are you sure? -Yes, but I can be white. -Alex? -Yeah? Put it away, we'll finish tomorrow. Thanks, Max...
