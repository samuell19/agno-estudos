Don't kill me! Don't! The cabin's just up ahead. We'll be there in a couple minutes. Put your stuff where ever you want. Watch out! Please, be careful. Hey, man... You better not cause any problems. I don't want anyone else to know we're here. Sorry, man, I didn't mean to. Hey, we got your back. Let's go. Come on. - Come on. The current in this lake changes every season. Now... I can't be certain... Where exactly the sunken treasure is located. Are you sure... That it's still even going to be there? I'm certain. There's no doubt it is. - Well... How about tomorrow we start searching in the West first? Remember... The treasure is ours to share. Don't do anything without getting orders from me first. Especially if you plan on keeping something for yourselves. Understand? If all goes well... We'll split it up like we originally agreed. Tommy 25% Johan 25% And 50% for me. Hey! Who's there? Hey! Stop! Don't run! Nice shot, man. - Not bad, Tom. Shit. Come on man, let's start here. Okay. What's this guy up to? Pono, Pono... I don't think he's ever slept this well. But, I can't drive like this. Ouch! Now he's drooling all over me. Drools and sleeps that's all he does. Wake up! So, where are we? Heaven. Don't you see all the angels waving to you? Yeah, right. - It's true, Pon. The angels have been pushing you back and forth the whole ride. Come on the only thing that did that, was me sleeping. That's why you don't fall asleep! Ah, no way. A good sleep is every persons right. Come on! Wait for me! Nin, wait for me, Nin! Hurry guys! Careful you don't fall! Hurry up! Careful Nin, the walkways a little broken. Noisy, Pon! So are you... Ah, amazing! - The air's so fresh here, isn't Nin? Hey, look someone else is here too. Good afternoon, folks. - Good afternoon, uncle. Sorry... Do you have permission to be on this lake? We don't. We don't have any special permission, just asked the local security, uncle. Did you know... This place is banned to the general public? The lake and the forest are haunted. Place is still full of demons and ghosts. Demons and ghosts? Yeah. Seriously? Are you trying to scare us, Uncle? I don't mean to scare you. But, you guys better get out of here quickly. Wait a minute, uncle. If there are so many ghosts here, than why are you here uncle? Well, me and my team are here investigating the rumours. We are just here to enjoy nature and won't do anything to damage it. We'll just stay right here. Yes, please we love it here. We'll risk it here. OK, it's up to you. I'm just letting you know. Thankfully he's gone! Aren't these our ancestral lands? - Hey! His ancestors are also your ancestors! Uh, what kind of person do you think he is anyways? Like what profession? - Ah, probably a nobody. At the very least a cow herder. I can't swim! Help! Nothing, man. We found nothing. We'd better move over to the east side. Let's wait a while to do that. Why wait, man? You see that? Unbelievable. Look, Tom. Fuck... Three idiots that'll get in our way. You're wrong. In fact, there are two of them that just might "energize" our work. Who are they, man? They say they are nature lovers. I already tried to scare them away, but they're stubborn. Hey, looks like the Old Man isn't alone. There's two handsome guys with him. Where, Nin? - There! Here. You're right, Nin. They are handsome. God! Even I look handsome at a distance. Sounds like someone's jealous. Come on, Nin. Let's go. Coming, Pon? No, I'm too cold. Dude. What do you think? I don't think it matters. Help! Help! Help! She's in danger! Help! Nin... Help! Sorry... Help! Careful... - Grab her arms. Are you okay, Nin? Didn't I tell you guys you should leave this place? That's what you get for being so stubborn. If they leave we can start up diving again tomorrow. Sorry man, I don't like this. They're just regular people and probably won't get in the way. Why worry? That's right, man. Let's not change our plans. In five days we should be done. Wait. Who is it? - It's us uncle, your next door neighbours. Evening, uncle. - Good evening, what do you want? Sorry uncle... We just came to... To thank you for saving me this afternoon. Hey! Looks like our place just got visited by some beautiful angels. Come in, please come in. Come in. Good evening. - Good evening. My names Tommy, but please just call me Tom. Hope you don't mind Nin and Hesty dropping in? No, absolutely not. My name's Johan. Make yourself comfortable and sit anywhere. Come, please. - Thanks. Don't be shy. Make yourself at home. - Come. Come. You damn mosquitoes! You still dare to bite me! Why keep doing it? I'm gonna end up running out of blood soon. Ouch damn it! This is what I get for being left alone? How long are the girls going to be gone? Probably awhile... Bang! Well, don't you look really cute. So... Do you want to be a diver? - I'd love to! Maybe Tom would like to teach Nina how to dive? Really? The fact is we're better at climbing mountains. Especially beautiful and tiny mountains. What do you mean "the tiny and beautiful mountains"? Ah, well... Like love mountain... And only intimacy lets... You reach their peaks. Come. Once you learn to dive... You'll quickly become addict to it. Because.... You'll find it so amazingly beautiful down there. But, I'm really afraid of jellyfish. In the water... Jellyfish will be a mesmerizing spectacle to behold. Ah, damn it... This is so boring being left alone out here. Nina? Hesty? Who could that be? Damn city girls and their slick guys ruining my night. No reason to stay here I guess. They obviously can't contain their lust.. Might as well go follow them. Nina! Hesty! Nina! Hesty! Oh, your bodyguard's here. Nina! Hesty! Hey, Pon! I'm over here! Hey! What're you doing? Didn't realize I was going to be left alone for the last 3 hours. You're making me stay up like I'm your personal security. And it real nice to chat here, but where's Nina? Hey, Pon! Don't get angry I'm right here, okay? Hey! You coming back to camp? Sooner or later? - You're real funny, aren't you. I'm miserable being left alone there. Let's go back then, Pon. Unless you want to stay? I thought you wanted to stay here. Hey... You do anything immoral with these diver guys? No... -Not yet. - Thank God then... Excuse yourselves. Good night, Tom. - Good night, Johan. That's great. I bring them and those guys get them. Hey! What're you talking about, Pon? - What? I didn't say anything. So let's go. Come on, already! What the hell was that, man? - I have no idea. Someone in a boat attacked us. Hesty. Hes... Hesty. Hes... Hey, Johan. What's up? I want to talk to you about something. Come on. Sit... Hes... I need your help. With what? Can you keep a secret? - What secret? I'll tell you later. Well... Hey, man... What are you doing out this late? You should go get some sleep. It'll make tomorrow a lot easier. Hesty? What is it, Nin? You shouldn't act like that with guys we hardly know. What do you mean? What were you doing with Johan? Don't act so high and mighty, Nin. It's not like that, Hes. I'm just saying. Be careful who you mess around with. Why do you care, Nina? We're young still. You're jealous, huh? Or do you have a crush on Johan? Quit it, Hes. Do you think I really want to steal your boyfriend? You bitch! What now? Hey! Nina! Hesty! Quit it! What're you doing? Ouch! Stop it! Out of my way! - Don't! Stop it! Out of the way! - Stop, already! God help! Nina! Come on! Stop fighting! Oh, stop! I said, stop it! Hesty! Damn it! I don't want... - Out of the way! To fight you! - Watch out! Nina, stop! Ouch...mommy... Ouch...mommy...my balls... Pono! - Pon! Lift him up, Nin! - Pon! What are they doing? Maybe looking for treasure. Let's go look. Come. - Come on. Man... There's another one even heavier. You'd better get to work on a crane. Okay, I'll go to town soon for supplies. Here. Open it. Close it! And throw it back in! Pono! Pon! Hesty! Let go! Let go! Let go! Let go! Let go! Let go! Let go! Nin, what is it?! - Nina! You okay, Nina? Breathe, Nin! - What's wrong, Nin? No, they're coming back! Who? - Who's coming, Nin? - Hesty! Nina! It sounds like Johan and Tommy. Why are they coming here? Something wrong? - Your tent's going to collapse in this rain. You guys should move. - Where to? Come back to the cabin with us, there's plenty of room. Come on. What do you think, Pon? - No. I don't care. It's up to you. Don't make me choose for you guys. Eh, Pono! Why do you make everything difficult? They are only trying to help. Come on guys, don't fight. This storm is really bad and we don't want you guys to get hurt. He's right and there's ghosts here too. Come on, let's go. Ghosts? Is that your excuse to go with them? If you want to go, go! Come, Nin. - Let's go. Quickly. - All right. Hey, wait! I'm coming too! Pono, hurry up! Wait for me! - All right! Thought you didn't want to come? Don't make a big deal out of it! We're all friends here, right? Are you afraid of the ghosts? - Ghosts? Not at all! My grandpa fights ghosts! He's a shaman... And I go with him all the time. Let's get going! You better stay right here, okay? But... Where's the old man? He kind of scares us. Really? Old Caroko? No need to worry... He went into town. What room's ours? Hesty. Come... It's cold... Please, get some rest. Thank you. - Come on, Tom. - All right. Hesty? Let's move the bed, okay? It's cold by the window. All right. Ready. Okay, one, two three... Oh, it's so heavy! Hes? Hesty! What's wrong? She fainted. She thought she saw a ghost. All this talk about ghosts. Well, she thought I was one. Hesty, wake up! Hesty! Stop, that's enough. Hesty... Okay, you guys can leave. Uh, I'll take care of her. Hesty? - Come on wake up. Hesty! - Hes! Hesty! -Hesty! Come here, Nin. - Hes! Pono, get her some water. - Yes... Hesty! Hurry up, Pono! Yes sir...I mean bro! Okay, sir! Ouch! Hesty... Hes! Hesty... Hesty... Johan! One at a time, Pon! Son of a bitch! Hey, Pon! Your move... You playing or just gonna stare? - I'm thinking. My middle name is Chess. I don't like to lose, so let me think. Think all you want, but hurry up. - Don't you rush me. Johan... Johan! You daydreaming? Everything okay? It's nothing, Nina. Everything's fine. Thank you. Check! I'll kick your ass now! Ah, you're a genius and so creative! Hey, where's the milk? And whose milk do you want to drink? This isn't a restaurant. Take it or leave it. Don't get angry sweet lady. Thank you, sister. Bro. - Yes. Where you going in this rain? Down to the lake. To check the boat. Hey! - Yeah? Your turn! Do you want to play or keep staring? Hesty... Hesty... Take this. Don't let anyone see it. Take care of it, okay? Whose is it? You don't need to know. - Now, you're scaring me. It was at the bottom of the lake and there's lots more. Please... This is worth a small fortune. And I'm going to get more right now. Hesty? Where you going? Need to pee. Tom, where's the bathroom? Straight out then keeping going right. Thanks, Tom - I'll take you? Ah, no need! I'm brave enough. You're so proud! Hey! Pono, you trying to catch a peek? Don't play games, okay? Watch yourself if you scare me again! Pon! Pono! Johan! Johan! No one's there. Pon! Pono! Bro! Johan! Pon, the door! - Yes! That wind has no manners. You don't just barge in like that. Devil! Pon, check on Hesty, she's taking a long time just to pee. That girl is always so much trouble. Now, where are you going? And what's with all the diving equipment at this time of night? Hesty? Hesty? Hesty? You sleeping in there? What's taking so long? You in there? Hesty, you there? No one's there. Hesty! Hesty! Oh God! Hesty! She's dead! She's dead! I'm sure Johan did this! God damn it! Damn savage! Murderer! He murdered Hesty! I have to get the police! Start! You damn stupid car! Start! Start! Nina! I can't find either Hesty or Pono. What? Where could they have run off to? I have no idea, Nin. Could be messing around, Pono isn't serious. More like a clown. Right... But, I have a bad feeling something happened. Maybe, they're having sex in the rain. We should just wait here. Motherfucker! Bad luck follows me everywhere I go. Hey! Wait! Who is that? Nina! You go that way, I'll go this way. - All right! Hesty! Pono! Nina! Nina! Sounds like a truck back at the cabin. Maybe it's them. Let's go look! Stop! Wait! Wait! Whose truck is it? No idea. Maybe it's one of the forest rangers. The lights went out. Gas must have run out. Come. We'll have to deal with being in the dark. The gas is in Caroko's truck. We have supplies back at our tent, let's go get them. Okay. Just wait here. I'll get them. You wait here. No way! I'm scared. I'm coming too. No way Nina. Stay here. Lock the doors. Something just doesn't seem right. Nina, don't leave until I get back. All right. Nina! Nina! I'm here, Nina! - Tommy? Nina! Help me, Nina! - Tommy? Help me, Nina! - Tommy, where are you? Nina! Help! Help me, Nina! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy, where are you? Bro? Tom? Tommy! Tommy? Pono! Caroko... Good evening. I'm Miss Hilda... The former occupant of that cabin. Miss... We need to get out of here fast. We need the police. - Why? All my friends have been murdered! First, you need to know something. Pity. Actually... Wealth always makes people kill each other... And innocent people... Get stuck in the middle. This house and lake used to belong to a very rich collector... Who also was an antiques dealer. That person was... My husband. He kept many priceless riches in this house. Over time, stuck in this lonely place... I started to go a little crazy. Evil thoughts began to cross my mind... I began to hate my husband. What is life if you are considered nothing more than another object? I was just a statue! I didn't want to be just another part of his collection. He had to die... In order to carry through with what had to be done... I was forced to hire someone to kill him. Do you know who that was? Caroko! We need to throw his body into the lake... Along with all his precious wealth. So no one can find it. What if the police follow our tracks? I'll tell them... That we were robbed... My husband was murdered... And they buried his body somewhere in the forest. Caroko tried to steal the treasure many times... But he always failed. No one has a right to the treasure, but me! Well, now you've heard all my stories haven't you? This means I have to kill you just like I did all your friends! Where am I? It's all right now miss, you're safe here. And my friends? I'm sorry they were all murdered. We are grateful to you miss... - Yes. You helped solve the case of Miss Hilda's... Husband's death. That was a mystery... Until now. But... What about the thing in the lake? Thing in the lake? Yes, it pulled me into the lake. It doesn't exist. It was just a dream. FANSUBBED: meatisgood
