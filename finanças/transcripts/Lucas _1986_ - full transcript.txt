Ready, hut! - All right! - Get up there! Six, seven, eight! Come on, come on. Climb up. Don't break. Six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight! Come on, good! Good! Smile! Look up! Come on, Smile! There's someone out there! - There! - There! Where? I think he's got a gun or something! - Pervert! - Pervert! Pervert! Pervert! Pervert! Pervert! Could you grab that for me? Thank you. -Do you play tennis? -No. Uh-uh. -What's that thing? -A net for insects. -You collect insects? -No. To collect them, you have to kill them. I just look at them. Oh. That's nice. Well, thanks. You're very good. Not so much when people are watching me. -Are you on the team? -No, I just moved here. -Is there a team? -Yeah, at school. -Which school? Park High? -Yeah. You go there? -You look-- -Younger. -I'm accelerated. -Oh, you must be real smart, then. Well, I'll see you there when it starts. -What's your name? -Maggie. Hi. I'm Lucas. -Hi. -Hi. -Bye. -Bye. All you need to know is one person. And you already know me. So when school starts, you'll have one good friend. That's all anybody needs as far as I'm concerned. Do you think people need more than just one good friend? Well, yeah. I'm perfect because I have many friends. I can introduce you to people. Hey, guys, what's happening? Hey, Cappie! How's it hanging, bud? That's Cappie Foew, number 88. Good buddy of mine. There's his girlfriend, Alise, cheerleading. Been together three years. You really know those guys? Do I know those guys? Of course I know those guys. I mean, we don't hang out or anything. You know, either you're an athlete or you're not an athlete. Actually, I am. I'm an athlete. I don't like to get caught up in that stuff. It's superficial. You know, football heroes, cheerleaders and parties. I'd be willing to play football if all that other junk didn't go along with it. My dad's working for this ad agency. They're doing a blue-jean commercial. And along comes Miss Designer Jeans of America. . . . . .who is 19 years old. And all of a sudden, my dad is like: ''Gosh, I have to work late again tonight. '' And my mom is all, ''Gee, he's spending a lot of time at work lately. '' -Well, listen, it happens. -Not with a girl who's 19. Age differences can be good. You have to keep an open mind. For instance, I'm 14, you're 16. Could you see me with a man who's 38 or something? No. But with a guy of 14-- Would your father do something like this? No. Of course he wouldn't. Well, my father's got other kinds of problems. Like what? Like being a workaholic. Like being caught in the system. Both of my parents, caught in the system. -Parties and social status. -That's bad. -Superficial. -That's terrible. That's what I mean about players and cheerleaders. -It's all superficial. -Absolutely. See? I like the way you're thinking now. -Which one's your house? -You just passed it. -That one? -Yeah. Wow. - See what I mean? - It's beautiful. -That materialistic display? -You don't look like you live there. That's a compliment. -Are you a communist? -No, but I do keep an open mind. That's what you should do about things, keep an open mind. Your father's girlfriend. She might turn out to be a great mother to you. She's three years older than me! Don't get hung up on all that tradition. Tradition is superficial. It's just a hang-up. Haven't you ever realized that? Here's your net. Here's your umbrella. Well, bye-bye, Lucas. It's perfect your name's Maggie. -Why? -Because a magpie's black-and-white. Oh. Perfect. -Bye-bye. -Bye. - Hi! - Hi! I've been trying to find you. I couldn't find this house -I didn't know your last name. -Really? -Yeah. Do you wanna play tennis? -I wish I could, but I can't. You have a bug on your shoulder! Get it off! Quick! Don't worry. It's just a locust. I didn't want to run over it with the mower. -Please get it away. -You should take a look. You won't see one again for 17 years. That's how long they take to incubate. - You can't play tennis? - Hey, Lucas! No. I gotta go. I promised the gardener I'd help him. -What's your phone number? -It's unlisted. And my parents don't like for me to give it out. -Oh. -Yeah. Well, then maybe I'll stop by sometime. They don't like people to stop by either. I can visit people. . . . . .but they just don't like people to make a mess of the house and. . . . -Oh. -Well, I can meet you there. -Where? -The tennis courts by the school. -When? -Three o'clock. -Today? -Every day! Okay. Lucas. Come on. Come on! -You're on the wrong side. Keep going! -I'm compromising. You don't understand. Stay on the right side of the road! Watch where you're going! -This is creepy, Lucas. -Don't worry. It's okay. What if we get lost? Hi there. We're with the Chicago Conservatory. Do you mind if we listen? -No, fine with me. -Thank you. They never mind. Come on, sit down. Sit over here. Excuse me. I hate to bother you again. . . . . .but would you possibly have a program I could borrow? Thank you very much. Whoa. Heavy night! Scootch. -Maggie? -Yeah? -Is your name Margaret? -Yes. -Margaret. -Yeah? No, I'm just saying it. Did you think we'd be such good friends when we first met? I don't know. What did you think of me? I thought you were interesting. I thought you were beautiful. -Do you still? -What? -Think I'm interesting? -Yes. Me too. Lucas, I think I like classical music. Lucas? Yeah? Is there something wrong? I just wish that school would never start. Freshmen take the pink form, sophomores take the gold form. . . . . .juniors take the white form and the seniors take the yellow form. How many trips are we going to take? I have a sign-up sheet here for the fall fiesta. -Because I was all-conference. -Oh, really? Excuse me. Making a movie. Excuse me. -Blye! Hey, Luca-duke! -Hey, Ben. -How was your summer? -What are you doing? Recruiting for the video club. You want to come out? -Aren't you going out for band? -I'm thinking about quitting. I think maybe you should too. They say the guy that's taking over is a real Nazi. They say he taught band at Joliet State Prison. What happened to Triechel? You didn't hear? Where have you been? He's dead. -What?! -Yeah. He killed himself. You didn't know? Hi, Lucas. - Oh, hi, Rina. - Hi, Rina. -How was your summer? -Did you hear about Triechel? Yeah, isn't it awful? He blew a blood vessel playing the trumpet. -He committed suicide, Rina. -He did not. He had a stroke. Are you talking about Triechel? He blew his head off. -Playing the trumpet, right? -Nope. Playing the revolver. - What did I tell you? - Jesus! - Well, why'd he do it? - Love. He was in love with a dental technician. - She wouldn't give him a shot. - So he gave himself a shot. - Triechel? - Can I have your attention, please? He didn't seem like the type. Could you quiet down? Guys? I'm tempted to say, ''Shut up,'' here, but I won't do that. Want to go to the movies tonight? You've all been real cooperative today. I know it's been kind of confusing. . . . . .and crazed and congested, and we're running 90 minutes late. So we're going to postpone registration until Monday. And if you'll all now proceed in an orderly fashion to the gym. I said, in an orderly fashion! We're going to have a short program that I'm sure you're all gonna enjoy. Pirates can't be beat! I wanna introduce you to the Pirates right now. You know them by name, you know them by number! Let's get them up here. Come on up, now! -Come right on up! Come on. -All right! Up here on the stage. -Come on, boys. Hustle it up! -Way to go! Hey, Luke! What are you, the football? Let's let everybody see your faces. These are the men whose names are gonna spell victory! Hey! Look who's going out for the football team! Leukoplakia! Come on up, Luke. - Come on! The stage is this way! - Come on, Bruno. Let's go, Luke! Let's go, Luke! Let's go, Luke! Let's go, Luke! Hey, Cappie! Your buddy's coming out for the team! Hey, Bruno! Hey, let him go! - All right. - Okay. -All right! -I'd like to get on with this, please. Whoa! Whoa! Okay. - All right. - That's enough, you guys. All right, if we can-- If we can get serious, here. . . . . .I wanna introduce the men who really belong on this stage. Okay. All right. Can you get off the stage, son? Will you get off the stage? Fight over there. All right. Captain of the team. . . . . .that's gonna beat Fockford in our first game in two weeks. . . . . .I want to introduce to you now number 88, Cappie Foew! All right! Lucas! Lucas! Yeah, hi. -Are you all right? -Me? Yeah. Were you in there? That was funny, wasn't it? That was planned. Well, see you. What are you doing this weekend? -I don't know. What are you doing? -My dad's visiting. Great. -I hope he doesn't bring his girlfriend. -Well, remember, keep an open mind. Lucas, are your parents going to this parents' night thing? I thought maybe we could introduce them to my mom. . . . . .because she doesn't know anybody. No. -No? -No, they don't do that! Oh. Well, I thought I told you! They're superficial. Well, didn't I? -Yes, Lucas. -Okay, then. You know who else you told me was superficial? Who? Football players. You were right too. They think you're someone to make fun of. Uh, listen, I heard they're playing something funny at the movies tonight. Come here. The movie's about to start. Let's go! Hey, Blye! You want me to get your tickets? Hey, Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke Get that ball away and puke If you need to go in front of my car, go ahead. Really, I won't kill you. I cross my heart. Seriously, go ahead. - Hey, Luke. - Hi. - How was your summer? - It was good. -All right. -You were a good sport today. Thanks. -Hi. -Hi. This is Maggie, guys. -Hi. -Hello. -I got our tickets. Got our tickets. -Thank you. - We'll see you inside, okay? - Bye, Luke. - Bye, Lucas. - Sorry I'm late. Hey, Luke! You want something? - Thanks. - Sure. Can I help you? Yes, ma'am. I'd like a tub of popcorn with butter. . . . . .a large Coke, a small Coke and, since I'm on a diet. . . . . .I'll have either Goobers or M&M's. Which one, guys? M&M's. Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke Get that ball away and puke Ben and Luke I'm gonna puke -What a gimp. -Come on, let's go. -Hey! Don't let him scare you away. -Scare me away? Yeah. Just tell him to eat shit. Yeah, I'd like some Feese's Pieces, some Milk Duds. . . . . .and some red twisty things for my girlfriend, please. So! What do you guys say? You coming out for the football team or not? We're trying to find you a jersey, but we're all out of pup tents. You should talk, shit-breath. -What did you say? -You heard me. No, I don't think I did. -What's going on? -This kid's mouthing off to me. -Let's go. -Wait a second. -What's the point? -I'm kidding around. And this fat little marshmallow opens his mouth to me. Don't worry about him. Let's see a movie. You better watch your mouth, fat boy. Learn to be like Lucas. -He's smart. Not like you. -He's scared. Not like me. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. -You know, you're asking for it. -Well, so are you! -What did you say? -You heard me! Maybe you boys would like to step outside. - Let's go. - No, I have to settle this. -I came to see a movie. -And so did I. -Yeah, but not King Kong. -Hey, man! - Settle down. - Let's go. No fights! I mean it! You should listen to the lady. If I was you, I wouldn't stick around to see the movie. You understand me, Leukoplakia? I'll be looking for you guys afterwards. -No, he won't. -The hell I won't. -They'll be with me afterwards. -Yeah? We're going out to eat. -Why do you always stick up for him? -Why are you always picking on him? Let's go. The movie's started. Just make sure we're on opposite sides of the Iine tomorrow. Sure. Can I get a Feese's, please? - Do you want anything? - No. -Maybe we should leave. -I'm not afraid of that shit-bag. -Don't worry about it. We're going out. -I can't. My mom's picking me up. -Sorry about that. -Yeah, well, so am I. I'll see you guys inside. I didn 't believe it. But you saw it. You saw it, didn 't you? Yes, I-- I saw it. I thought she was-- As God is my witness, I saw the thing. You've committed murder just as much as Elaine did. Why do they call you Leukoplakia? Does it mean something? Leukoplakia is cancer of the mouth. I think they've done it. It's the same with pigeons. You can tell by the way they kiss. Help me! Help me! It was huge, man! Huge! ''Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me! '' Let's score some beers. Screw beers. Let's get bandoleros! -What are bandoleros? -I don't know. But some guy said he'd get great bandoleros. - Can we get a little organization here? - Let's turn it up. - It's a great song. - Come on, turn it up! All right! - What was that? - Jesus! - Jesus Christ! - What was that? - Is everybody all right? - I don't believe it! - Holy shit! - Are you okay? - Are you all right? - I thought I was gonna die! ''Help me! Help me! Help me! '' You think the car's all right? - Let's take a look at the hood. - Let's check it out. -You all right? -Yeah. Look at the windshield. - What were those things? - I don't know, they were scary! - Something hit me in the face. - They were bugs. It was locusts. Listen! - To what? - I can't hear anything. - I don't hear anything. - They're hatching in the trees. -I wanna get out of here. -They can't hurt you. I don't care. I want to get out of here. - In Africa, people eat them. - Get the mustard. - I wanna get out of here. - Felax. I just wanna get out of here! I hate to say this, but there's something in your hair. -Shut up! -I'm serious! - Oh, shit! - Alise. Alise, relax. Felax! It's okay! It's all right! Settle down. I'll get it! I'll get it! Calm down. Look, I got it. - Did you get it? - I got it. Look, it's out. It's out. - It's okay. - See? It's just a bug. -Thank you. -I don't mind them. - Lucas told me all about them. - You got one? Let me see it. - Let's see. - Is that thing for real? - Check it out. - All right! - Into the Iight. - I can't see it. - Look how big it is! - I gotta be real delicate. It's a baby. It's the first time it's seen the world. It just hatched. -Are you sure you're okay? -Are there any more in my hair? No, I don't see any. Wow. - Look at its wings! - Check it out! - Look at that! - It doesn't move. - It's not trying to get away. - Hey, it must be dumb. It's not dumb. Its wings are still wet. It's totally helpless. I've never seen these things before. They onIy hatch out every 17 years. - How come every 17 years? - He loves bugs. He's a great kid. -Thanks for sticking up for him. -It's okay. I like him. I'm glad. - He did something for me once. - Did he? Well, what did he do? Cappie? Can we get out of here right now? -Please? -Sure. - I think it's ugly. - Does it bite? It doesn't have a mouth. All it lives for is to mate. - Hey, like me! - I think it's moving a little. - What are you doing? - Step on it! - Don't! - Guys! I got it! Oh, my God, it looks like a huge M&M! That's disgusting. Let's get out of here. Let's go. Hey, guys, come on, let's go. - Luke! - Let's go. Luke, come on. And I always like a big, strong, handsome man in the kitchen with me. Because a big, strong man. . . . . .always seems to feel so helpless. -Well, you don't seem very helpless. -No, ma'am. -You've broken a banana very well. -Thank you. Something handed down from my ancestors. By the family tree, you might say? You might say, yeah. - Ready to make your drink? - Yeah. -Are you capable of handling this? -Ouite capable, yes. I mean, you've never used a blender before. -No problem. -Anything you've left out? Bananas, milk. Not that I can see, no. -Nothing that you, overlooked? -No, ma'am. All right, then. Blend away. Way to go, sport! Who'd like to show this big, strong man how to use the washer-dryer? I think there's a gizmo to put this in. . . . . .but I just sprinkle it on top. Okay. Oh, mini-cycle. -And that's that. -Okay. So. . . . -I hope it gets done in time. -So do I. Yeah. Uh. . . . Do you wanna go or. . .? Oh, well, you know how to use the dryer? Yeah, I think I can do it. I just don't know where to start. -I have 15 minutes. -Okay. Table for two? Care to join me? -Very boring. -Very. I guarantee the dryer will be a lot worse. Don't panic. It's trying to get out. Pretty good. Some gum? It's good for you. -Really? -Oh, yeah. Dextrose, softeners. . . . . .artificial flavors. Good stuff. I like Alise. She's real pretty. Thanks. You guys been going together a long time? Yeah. It's real serious, huh? Well, it's serious, but. . . . I don't know about this gum. I didn't wanna say anything. Here. Some people would be grossed out by that. -Not me. -I know Alise would. -She gets easily grossed out. -I don't. Well, except for some things. Some things? Like. . .? Like. . . . -Like what? -Like phlegm or something. . . . . .when it flies out of a handkerchief. Or if someone throws up on your shoe. You know, that happened to me once. -Well, you asked. -No, tell me about it. I'm interested. We were on this plane to Orlando, I was wearing Loafers and no socks. And I have two hours left on this flight when this man threw up on my shoe. It was really disgusting. -How was Orlando? -Oh, it was fantastic. -I'm gonna travel myself someday. -Oh, me too. What's up with you and Lucas? I mean, as far as-- -We're just friends. -Yeah? He's very special. -Oh, he's the best. -And he's so smart. -You're telling me how smart he is? -You know. . . . . .it's nice to know somebody who has really heavy thoughts. -Absolutely. Yeah. -Do you? -What? -Have heavy thoughts? Oh, yeah, sure. All the time. I'm not having any right now. . . . . .but just give me some time. What did he do for you? -You said he helped you once. -Oh, right. Yeah, with my schoolwork. I was out with this case of hepatitis for a couple months. . . . . .and he came by my house every day and brought my books to me. I still don't know why he did it. Because you're nice to him. I didn't used to be. I used to treat him like everybody else does. Why do people do that? I don't know. Because he's strange, I guess. You know, last year he even had this strange walk. He said it had something to do with the force of gravity. Just the way he mouths off in class sometimes. That's how the term ''Leukoplakia'' got started. Oh. Anyways, I do owe a lot to him. And I like him. I do too. So I'll do what I can to keep him from getting hurt. Yeah. And then there's Alise. -Fight. -I mean, she likes him too. Oh, right. That's nice. She thinks you're very beautiful. -Really? -Yeah. Did she say that? I think she's jealous. Of me? Why? Are you cold? Oh, no! He shoots! He scores! Whoa! What a shot! Look out! This kid's an all-American! What a shot! Tied now. No time left. Pulls up. Money shot! I told Alise I thought you should try out for cheerleading. That's why she got jealous. I still think you should. So it's an honor to represent the school. And it looks real good on college applications. And anybody can join. Even boys. The Supreme Court says anyone who tries out for a team. . . - . . .has to be given a chance. - I'd like to point out. . . . . .that cheerleading is very good exercise for your body. A lot of doctors say it's even better than aerobics. And it's not too bad for your social Iife either. -What's going on here? -Shh. -What are you doing here? -I'm listening. Can you meet me after school? I'll get you an A in biology. - Shh. - We have eight places to fill. We practice every day and take buses with the guys to the away games. Some bus drivers don't care what goes on in the back of the bus. Or what beverages may be consumed. - Don't say you heard it here. - If anyone's interested. . . . . .take an application and meet at the practice field right after school today. -You have a change of clothes here? -Why? If you come down to the stream and collect stuff for Karlson's terrarium. . . . . .I'm sure he'll give you an A. Maggie? -When? -Today. I think I'm gonna do this today. Cheerleading? -Well, check it out. -What for? -Because I might wanna do it. -What, be a cheerleader? I don't know. -Is that all right, Lucas? -Me? Hey. . . . -The way you were looking at me. . . . -Whatever. I can wait till tomorrow to collect tadpoles. Well, if I like it, I'll be doing it tomorrow too. They practice every day. It sounds like fun, Lucas. Well, didn't you hear what they said? Away games and buses. . . . . .and stuff. Well, I guess everybody has their own idea of fun. Some people go to football games. Other people do Iess superficial things. Look, Lucas, just because you don't approve of something. . . . . .doesn't mean other people don't have a right to enjoy it. -Well, you're in the band, aren't you? -Yeah. -So? -So? -So the band goes to football games. -Well, totally different. -Why? -The band does not have fun there. -Then why do you do it? -Well, I don't know. Figure it out. And in the meantime, don't call people superficial. . . . . .just because they wanna have fun! I'm new here. I don't know anybody. Why can't you be helpful and understanding about that? Hey, Laura, wait up. Hi. Hey, thanks for waiting for me. I've gotta talk to you. I thought about what you said to me, about you needing to meet people. . . . . .and me not being very understanding about that. - Hey, Luke. - Hey, Cap. I'm glad you're here. I've gotta talk to you too. -Great. How's the cheerleading going? -Great. I love it. I hear you're terrific. -Really? -Yeah. I thought maybe Cap can give us a ride next Friday. Is that okay? - What? - What are you talking about? If you could take Maggie and me to the dance, it'd be great. -She has a strong need for acceptance. -Really quite all right, Lucas. It's okay. Cappie won't mind. She has this peer-group thing. -I hate to see her get desperate. -Jesus. It's okay. I can take you. Sure. - Cappie? - Hey. We're taking Luke and Maggie to the dance Friday, if it's all right with you. Hey! You two are going out? You make a neat couple. That's great. Should we dress up? Wear a tux or something? You might get it all wrinkled if you come up on the hill with us afterwards. - Fight. The hill. - It's a nice back seat. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. I brought you some tadpoles, but they need a change of water. Did I say I was going to any dance with you, Lucas? No, would you? Honestly, Lucas. Hi, Lucas. Hi, Rina. Chorus is sounding pretty good, don't you think? Yeah. There's a dance on Friday. Did you know? Yeah. Wanna go? -Thanks. I have a date. -Oh. Your lunch is leaking. Ouietly, please! Go for it, Gus. - Five bucks says no way. - You're going down. Going down. Lukey, we're over here. Sit. We're trying to figure out how to get rid of this jackass band teacher. -I hate the idiot's guts. -Too bad Triechel had to kill himself. Why'd he leave us with this jackass? Sex-crazed, that's why. - He was in love. - A dental technician? - Not everyone. . . . . .has to be glamorous to have someone fall in love with them. You don't die over a dental technician. -Ever heard of Romeo and Juliet? -Was she a dental technician? People do kill themselves when they can't have who they love. - I thought he had a heart attack. - No heart attack. Blew his brains out with a book of poetry open and a rose. I think it's kind of beautiful. The poetry, I mean. It was probably Keats or Shelley. Come on, man! Or do you wanna go with something like this? - That is so tacky. - Oh, beautiful. Maybe I'll wear this to the dance. Yeah, can you see me wearing this? Yeah, and add a little fishnet and some high heels. You'll be voted prom queen. You never know. - Are you really gonna go? - It'll be fun. I'm so sorry. You think I'm stupid? You think I can't see? - I don't think that. - I'm glad. You're overreacting. I turn around, and you're walking with her or looking or smiling at her. - Will you calm down? - No, I will not. She's new. She doesn't know anybody. - I'm supposed to feel sorry? - Have some compassion. She can make friend. . . . . .doesn't have to get buddy-buddy with my boyfriend. - I'm just being nice to her. - Well, stop being nice to her. I don't want you talking to her anymore. I don't wanna see you walking with her and smiling at her. I don't want her in this car on Friday. We're not giving her a ride. She can put her fat ass on Lucas' bicycle, where it belongs. You think you can tell me what to do? We're not taking them to any dance, that's final. You can either stop being nice to her, or you can forget about me. Alise. Hey, Alise. -Hi. You must be Lucas. -Yeah. -I've heard a lot about you. -Really? -Yeah. You look terrific. -Thank you. It's a big night. Fight. I'll get Margaret for you. - I'm right here, Mom. - Here she is. See you later. Bye-bye. Hi. Wow, look at you. - You look great. - You too. -You rented a tux? -Yeah, I rented it. I bought the tie. I get to keep it. And I bought the shoes. -You went through so much trouble. -No, it's no problem. I'll pay you back if it costs a lot. No, it's fine. So you ready to go? I don't think we can go, Lucas. Why not? Cappie and Alise broke up today. -But aren't they here? -Cappie's here. . . . . .but he's very depressed. Sit down. She was jealous or she doesn't like me or something. She said she'd break up with him if he went through with it. She didn't want to go with us, Luke. So I think we have to call it off. I have my bike. We can still go. He kind of needs someone with him tonight. I don't wanna leave him by himself. He had tears in his eyes when he came over tonight. Can you imagine that big, strong guy crying? Hey, Luke. I'm sorry, bud. Am I a drag or what? Listen, I think you should come to the dance with us. I think it'll cheer you up. No, I'd feel like a third wheel. We were thinking of going out for a pizza. Why don't you come with us. Yeah, why don't you. You're going out for pizza? Well, it's just a suggestion. If you're so depressed, how come you're eating pizza? Maybe I should just go home, huh? No. Go eat pizza. Don't let me spoil your depression. Are you okay? Where are you going? To the dance. By yourself? Hey, I'm a party animal. Lucas? Is that you? I'll meet you there, okay? What are you doing? - Nothing much. - You look nice. Thank you. Drinking beer? Dragonfly nymph. You ever see one? Oh. It's ugly. I'm glad it's not bigger than me. It turns into something very beautiful, Rina. -Is that possible? -Yeah. Can you imagine that? Turning from something ugly into something beautiful? No. Frankly, I can't. Gonna bring it to Karlson? I thought you had a date. -No. -Well, are you going in? Why not? Thinking. About what? -Romeo and Juliet. -Really? How come? How old were they? Do you know? She was 13, and I guess he was about the same. Why? -Two different worlds, huh? -Romeo and Juliet? Yeah. That can be a problem. Are you all right, Lucas? Why? Because you're acting weird. Just thinking about something, Rina. Something I've got to decide. Rina, come on. I don't wanna go in there by myself. Just a minute. -Go ahead. -No. I gotta go anyway. What are you deciding? If it landed on tails, we'd be somewhere else right now? Sure. Tails, I turn left. Heads, I turn right. Once, I did it all night, wound up at the airport. - What did you do? - Got on a plane to Tahiti. You're lying. To tell you the truth, I wound up at a bowIing alley. BowIed a great game, though. Do you believe in destiny? Is that why you flip coins? I guess so. Do you? -I'm interested in destiny. -Yeah? What else are you interested in? -A lot of things. -Things. Like. . .? Like. . . . Like politics? -So-so. -Yeah? You interested in wide receivers? -What's that? -The position I play. Oh, is that what you do? -Sort of. -Good. -Are you interested in cars? -No. No? Are you interested in being kissed? Yes. - Did you hear about Lucas? - What about him? -It's suicide. -What do you mean? - He's gone out for the football team. - And.... Eat meat! Eat meat! Eat meat! Eat meat! Eat meat! Eat meat! Eat meat! Eat meat! Ready. . . . - Hit! - Dig in! Dig in! Dig, dig, dig! Ready. . . . - Hit! - Come on! Dig, dig, dig! Take your places! Let's go! Move! Hit! Son? You. Come over here. The rest of you, hit the tires! -What the hell are you doing? -Excuse me? -Who suited you up? -I'd like to speak to you about that. -This equipment just doesn't fit. -No, that's not the problem. It's you that don't fit. Now, go turn it in. Excuse me. I can run really fast when I concentrate on it. I said, turn it in. Now, get off the field. All right! Everybody inside for chalk talk! Shower up first! -Let's go, go, go! -You're making a big mistake. I'll be very good at this. I can Iower my center of gravity, see? Look, look. See? And my size. I gotta run fast. If they catch me, I'm dead. Listen, little buddy. We got our first game Saturday against Fockford. . . . . .and I don't have time to dick around with you. Well, I'm afraid you'll have to, sir. Dick around with me. The Supreme Court, by virtue of the Sexual Discrimination Act. . . . . .says that anyone who tries out for a team sport. . . . . .has to be given the same chance as everyone else. Now, if you wish to cut me based on my performance, that's your right. But I'll take you to court if you try to before. -What's this shit? -I looked it up. My family's in law. The goddamned longest practice! I'm not playing with this helmet! I'm serious, man! No more hitting for me! These pads have had it too! I'm serious! -Are you gonna put that stuff on me? -Just quit being a wimp! - It's gonna burn like hell! - It's supposed to. -OnIy way to get under that muscle. -Get it off! Please. Cut the drama, all right? You'll live. All right, girls. Let's hit those showers, then it's chalk talk. We have one week till our first game. - Our first win. - Screw Fockford! Yeah, screw Fockford! Hey, where's my towel? Who took my towel? Luke, can I talk to you for a minute? I think I know why you're doing this. No. You can't talk to me. She wasn't your girlfriend, Luke. Hey, Leukoplakia! They got a jockstrap to fit you? Maybe one of you guys should stop by sewing class tomorrow. . . . . .and pick up a thimble. Lucas, here, needs a jockstrap. Or maybe a thimble would be too big. Hey, anybody got a contact lens? A contact lens and a Band-Aid. -You referring to the size of my penis? -Yeah, I am. With a flaccid penis, it's the number of folds that count. Anyway, I don't get semierect around other males like some of you fellas do. -What'd you say? -It's a University of llIinois study. You can tell the fags in a warm shower by who's got the longest dong. Look. Yours seems to be growing even now. -The hell it is. -It is. Look! -Hey, look! He's getting a hard-on! -Hey, yeah, he is! Hey, don't nobody bend over to pick up the soap! -You little shit. -They say physical violence. . . . . .is an expression of sexual feeling. - Let's get him! - Oh, shit! - Shit. - Come on, get him! You guys! You guys! - Hey, let's give him a rubdown! - Yeah! Hey, hey, guys! What's going on? - No! Guys! - Give me the hot stuff! -Spread-eagle! -Yeah! - What is that? - It'll teach you how to dance! -Hey, hey, enough! -Hey, all right! - The joke's over. - We're kidding. -No, I'm serious! -Shut up! Come on! -Come on, guys! -Come on! Have fun, Luke. Have fun. You guys, come on! The joke's over. Lucas! Guys, come on. Please! The joke's over. Come on! -Mind telling me what you're doing? -These guys, are they great? -Why are you doing this? -I just like to jump! -What's the matter with you? -I love to dance. Jacksons! Not bad, huh? Hi there. Sure is a warm day. Hi there. You can't make me quit! Ever! You dropped out of band. You've lost interest in Mr. Karlson's terrarium. And now this picking fistfights in the Iocker room? That's not accurate. Well, look, accurate or not, the point is. . . . . .these are very serious distress signals. And now this crazy idea about going out for the football team. . . . What's so crazy about it? Because it could be dangerous for a boy like you. Well, you have no right to stop me. Do your parents know about this? Going out for the football team? Yes. I'd like them to come in and see me. Well, that's not possible. My dad is just way too busy. And he agrees with me totally. He's a civil-rights lawyer. If you think he'll agree with you, he'll sue the school. . . . . .if you bring him here, Mr. Kaiser. I'd hate to see that happen. I like you, Mr. Kaiser. I'd hate to see you lose your job. Just the same, I'll instruct the coach not to let you near that football field. . . . . .until your parents come in and talk with me. And that ends our talk. Can I leave now? Can I just suit up? Just suit up and sit on the bench? I'm doing you a favor, Luke. You're not cut out for this. Lucas! Lucas! Lucas! -Will you wait for a minute? -No. -Lucas, come on, I want to talk to you. -Go away. -Go away. -You're being unreasonable. Please? I don't wanna talk. - Oh, Lucas, don't be silly. - Get away from me! Come on out, Lucas. I know you're in there. I can see your feet. -Have you been crying? -Yeah, so what? I mean, wimps do that. Didn't you know? Just like big, strong guys. -What do you want me to do, Lucas? -I don't care. I mean, just keep doing what you're doing. Go to bed with him. -That's not fair. -Yeah, a lot of things aren't fair. Lucas, you and I were just friends. Why? -What do you mean, ''why''? -I mean, why just friends? Because that's all we were. Yeah, but why? -Well, you're 14. -Romeo was 14. I don't know, Lucas. There are certain people you like in a certain way. . . . . .and others you like as a friend. I don't know why. You know about science. Do you know why? Yeah. Actually, I do. It's called the process of natural selection. You ever heard of Darwin? The males who demonstrate physical prowess are most attractive to females. By breeding with the strongest males, females ensure survival of the species. -You know how wonderful you are? -Yeah, but it doesn't turn you on. Lucas, I want you to be my friend. What are we gonna do with you? Go away. Go. Leave! Leave! Go! Go away! Cappie, Cappie, he's our man If he can 't do it, no one can Bruno, Bruno, break that guard Hit him, hit him, hit him hard Oh. . . . I love it. I love it. You bozos! Time! Time-out!

Get off of the field! You have nothing to lose. They're whipping your ass. -Listen to me-- -Put me in. I'll never come back. -Let me play. You have nothing to lose. -Hear me good, you pissant. -I'm gonna tell you one more time. -Don't you call me that! Don't you call me a pissant, you dumb fucking jock. -What'd you say? -You heard me, pencil brain. Who we kidding here? Who's the pissant? The second-rate coach of a third-rate team or me? -What's your name? -Lucas. -I mean your last name! -Blye. You're right, Blye. I've got nothing to lose by sending you in! -Yes, sir! -Karger, out!

Break! -Get out of the way! -Block that guy right there. -Lucas! -Twenty-nine! Set. Hut! Hut! Okay, Blye! Had enough? - You all right? - I'm fine. -Get out.

Did someone call his parents? - Phone's not listed. - Let's go to his home. -Can I come? -Yeah. - Just say when. - When. It's this one right here. This one. -Lucas doesn't live here. -Yes, he does. -He lives in the trailer park. -He lives here. I've seen him here. This is just one of the houses he works at. He works for a gardener. Yeah, he does work for a gardener. I know that. Nobody's home. I think we should go. Have you ever met them? - His parents? - Just the father. I don't know if there is a mother. . . . . .but the father came to school once. He embarrassed Lucas. He's kind of alcoholic. I think we should go to the hospital. Come on. The doctors say he was unconscious. You're awake? Yeah. I thought you were unconscious. I don't think so. -Are you okay? -Yeah. Hey, I'm okay. -You know, you could've gotten killed. -Did we win? No way. Boy, they sure were big. I don't want you ever playing football again. Okay. You. Magpie. Locust. They're all gone, you know. The locusts. I was just outside. They aren't making any noise anymore. Not for 17 years. I'm sorry for doing this. I guess you had to. Yeah. You know, survival of the species and all. What are you thinking? I'm just wondering where we'll be when they come back. -Who? -The locusts. -Gosh, I don't know. -You'll be 33. Wow. -I'll be 31 and a half. -Yeah. I wonder if we'll still know each other. I don't know. -I hope so. -Oh, me too. Here he comes. Let's go. Look, there he goes. He almost got killed. - Hey, jock! You blew it! - Keep trying! - There's Lucas! - Whoa, he's back!
