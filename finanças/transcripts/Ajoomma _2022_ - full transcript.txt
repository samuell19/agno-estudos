It's easy. -The instructor teaches well. -You are good too. I have to go off first. I need to buy things for my trip to Korea. You still have two weeks! Someone's excited! Don't you know what my son is like? It's better that I do it. Bye. I shall make a move first. Bye-bye! How much? Four dollars. Regular customer's price. Thank you. This is 15 dollars. 15 dollars? Is 13 dollars okay? It's very cold there right now. Bring more warm clothes! I will, I will. Why are you following me? Do you want to die? Do you want to die? Brother, you need to know something! Do you want to die? Do you want to die? Where did you get this? Grandma… Jae Sung… That's your real mother holding you in her arms. That's the home you lived in before you were taken away. Just reached home. I'll call you later. Bye-bye. My mother… where is she? Overtime again? Yes. What's for dinner? The job in the US… They want to fly me in for the interview. Oh. If I get it, I'll earn double my salary. So good? Where in the US? Santa Monica. By the sea. Very sunny. It's also sunny in Singapore. Eat the last piece. Don't waste it. You don't have to cook beef. I know you don't eat it. It's okay. I know you like it. Can you help me change the lightbulb? Okay. Do you have this? I want to buy it for my son. This is sold out. I'll see if there's anything similar. One second, please. Old man, how are you over there? Please watch over Sam. Keep him healthy, safe, and successful. Time flies, right? It's been three years. Ma. They want me to fly in earlier. On the 19th. I already called the tour agency. So what now? Let's go to Korea another time. Isn't it too late to cancel? The tour company says it's okay. They'll refund me. We've been planning this trip for a long time. This job is very important to me. We'll go another time, okay? Planning this trip sounds like a headache. Does anyone want to go with me? It's difficult to travel during Lunar New Year. Do you want to come over on the second day of the Lunar New Year? We can watch Korean dramas together like When Spring Blooms. The Kim Soo Hyun one? Yeah, he's so handsome, right? Not as handsome as my Gong Yoo. In episode ten of Miss Fortune, he kissed the lead actress… So romantic… Especially in the snow! Remember to call me when you get there. Okay. Did you bring your passport? Yes. Bye. Bye-bye. Good luck. Hello! Anybody home? Yeah. Delivery for Sam Lim. One, two, three. Where do I install this? I don't know anything about my past. I don't know who I really am. Has my life been nothing but a lie? Go find your mother. I will be here for you. -Hello?-Hello? Is this Lim Bee Hwa? -Yes.-Auntie, sorry to call you this late. I'm from Horse Run Tours. I tried to call your son, but he didn't pick up. Can I confirm you want to cancel your trip to Korea? Yes. Okay. I'm not sure if you remember, but your tour booking is not refundable. My son said there would be a refund. No, Auntie, it is not refundable. It was stated very clearly when you made the booking that this tour booking was not refundable. Also, the flight is tomorrow. All the arrangements have been made, including flights, hotels, etc. It's such a waste if you don't go. So if you can make it, you should really go on the trip. Can I call you back? Okay, please let me know. Bye-bye. Hello, Sam. The tour agent called about the trip-- I'm sleeping. You're sleeping? Sorry, sorry. Go back to sleep. Call me when you are free later. Okay. I'll call you when I wake up later. Okay. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. You will enjoy this trip, rest assured. Departure this way. Enjoy yourselves! Hello, Auntie! Are you going on the 5-day "Secrets of the Stars" tour or the 10-day "Hebei Health" Tour? The Korean tour. Annyeonghasaeyo! Here's your sticker. Here, this way. Let's go, hurry up! We have to check in, get the boarding pass… Ah Young, I thought you said the Singaporeans arrived before the Chinese? Why have we been kept waiting for such a long time? Why are we still here? We are waiting for one more guest. -You said that half an hour ago! -Please, wait a little longer… Take them to the bus. I'll wait for her. It's better if we wait for everyone. You… you're so uptight, you know that? Why are you arguing with someone more experienced here? Ah Young, just go! We'll be at lot number 9-- Just go! Everyone, follow me, please! Hello. Immigration form, please. Huh? Immigration form. I understand. Yes, I won't let you down again. Yes, I understand. Yes, boss, yes… Yes, yes… Hey, Horse Run Tours? -Singapore right? -Yes, yes! Okay, let's go. Wait! Slow down! Come, sit here. -Who are you? -My name is Kwon-Woo. I'm your Mr. Tour Guide. It's okay! -Are you sure? -Yes. There's no time! The bus has to leave! Hang on tight! Let's go! Excuse us! Careful! Here. Okay. Auntie Lim, right? Annyeonghasaeyo! Welcome to Korea! Let's board the bus. What's wrong? This is his. Okay. Okay, board the bus. You can get on the bus first. -Hello. -Hello. She's finally here. We've been waiting for ages. All right, all right. There's an empty seat here. I boarded the wrong bus. Auntie, this is your name, right? Yes, but I'm with Horse Run Tours. Why does it say "Sena Tours"? We are sister companies. Don't worry. My son, Sam Lim, he canceled. But if he doesn't get his job in the US, he might join-- Take a seat, we'll talk later. Get out of the way! Give it to me… Auntie, this is the same tour you signed up for. Sometimes we mix our international guests. But that's okay. Everyone here is very welcoming, right? Please say "annyeonghaseyo" to our Singaporean friend! Hurry up! Okay, okay. Next time, just tell them whatever they need to hear to be happy. Welcome to our 5 days and 4 nights "Secrets of the Stars" tour. Any fans of Jae Sung and Mi Na here? My name is Kwon Woo. You can call me Little Woo. I'm your Mr. Tour Guide. I'm so damn tired and I just want this to be over with, but we're stuck together for the New Year. What did you say? I said I'm so excited to be here with everyone during the New Year. This is our junior guide, Ah Young. And our driver, Mr. Cho. Hello! Let's go! Let's go! Follow him, please. We will gather back here in an hour! Watch your step. Stand closer! One, two, three! Is the watermelon sweet? Sweet! Done! Let's go take photos over there. My Eon Sae, how's my baby doing? I don't know when Papa's coming home yet. Okay, I know… Almost there. Okay, everyone, we're here! I hope you're hungry! Ma, slow down. A little sip won't kill anyone. You say that all the time. Come, Big Sister. Not too much. I don't drink. It's very light. Anyway, what's a holiday without a drink? Cheers! Who's that? Spam, spam. At this hour? It's 9:00 p.m. now. Eat, eat. I'm going home now. Senior, did you see the hotel change in the itinerary? Of course I did. I'm trusting you with this. Happy New Year! Thank you, Happy New Year! What hotel change? The usual one is closed. Something about a renovation. I don't know. We're going to another one nearby. Didn't you know? Huh? As if I wouldn't know something big like that. Eat this piece, brother. Cheers! America! Yes, my son is very smart. He's in IT. So is he coming? If he doesn't get the job, he might join me in Korea. Wow, traveling by yourself… You're so brave! Was your son worried? A little bit. What is there to be worried about? There are 20 people in the tour group. I think you're brave for traveling alone. Let me toast you, sister! Cheers! -Cheers! -I see you found a new reason to drink. Is your son married? Not yet. Does he have a girlfriend? I don't know. With boys… they don't tell you much. He's just like my husband. Stubborn. Do you know what "stubborn" means? It means he always wants it his way. And he never shares anything with me. Auntie, are you okay? Big sister. -Take this. -Okay. Okay. Auntie, why don't you know how to drink? My husband hated to see me drink. He didn't like it, so you didn't drink? Now you're drunk and I have to take care of you. Am I drunk? Don't tell my son I was drinking. Maybe he'd come to Korea if he knew. No. He won't come. It will take us 45 minutes to get to our hotel, with a quick stop along the way. Until then, those of you who have had too much fun, please help yourself to the free bottles of mineral water. Here you go. Thank you for helping me buy this. You saved me. Is there any change left? Oh yes, there you are. Thank you. So how do we get to your place? Take the first exit off the highway and I'll guide you from there. We'll be making a ten-minute stop here. Who is it? Happy New Year, Mother-in-law. Mother-in-law! One second, please. I told you to stop visiting us. I've been so busy with work. But I wanted to pass a small gift to you. Work? You? Of course, Mother-in-law! May you live a long life! Is Min-Young in? I need to speak with her. What for? I just want to wish her and Eon Sae a happy New Year. They're not here. Just go! Mother-in-law… Here is something small for you. Don't you understand what you got yourself into? Haven't you given my daughter enough pain?! I'm not going to take your money! Get out! Hello, Sam? Hello. Ma. How did your interview go? I didn't get the job. Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Wait, wait, I can't hear you. Wait a second. Happy New Year. What's this? Goodbye. We're ready to leave. Let's get back on the bus. Finally, let's go to the hotel! Oh, you didn't get the job? Never mind, your job in Singapore is not bad, right? I don't want to talk about it. Why is your voice so hoarse? Just a sore throat. Your mother is not used to the cold. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait, wait! Wait, wait! What's going on? Nobody's picking up. Do you have somebody else you can call? Do you speak Chinese? I don't get it. They'll come back. Just wait for the bus. Who peed on the wall like a dog? Uncle, who's that? You speak Chinese, don't you? Just a little. Ask her if she has someone to call. I don't know how to say that. Just say anything in Chinese. Hello. Hello. Is that it? Who doesn't know how to say "Hello" in Chinese? Yes? Hello? It's the security guard. It's about your son-in-law. Who? He left one of his tour passengers behind here. Do you have his number? For goodness sake. Madam? You're there, right? That man doesn't live here anymore! Stop bothering us! That tour guide is a piece of work. Think you can handle things here? If I go now, I can drop her off at her hotel in Sinchon. Wow, uncle. I didn't know you were so kind. It's on the way home. If you can't speak Chinese, can you at least speak some English? I will try my best. Tell her the plan. Hear… You. Him. Go to… Hotel. It's okay, don't bother. Central. Central Hotel? Yes! Come! Him good. Good man. Very nice. Go, go. Don't worry. Trust. Let's go! Hurry up! Brother. How long more till the hotel? About five minutes. Why? Well… We are missing someone. What? What happened? I don't know. I think she's back at the apartment. Who? The Singaporean Auntie. Oh, we have to go back. She won't survive the cold. No. I'll check the guests in first. The boss shouldn't know this. I cannot get fired. No one should know, okay? Rise and shine! We're almost at the hotel! -Here are your keys. -Yes, thank you. Mr. and Mrs. Gao, your room key. Mr. and Mrs. Wang, Room 506. Have a good rest! Here, look at this. It's closed. They are closed for renovation. Hyun Moo, what are you doing back there? Come say hi! Yes, I'm coming. Happy New Year, Uncle. Good boy. Happy New Year to you. Yes. Delicious. Eat, eat. Oh yes, Hye Yung… Can she stay with you tonight? Don't you think it's better for her to be with her tour group? Maybe she has family. What family? Nobody realized when they left her behind. She must be so scared. It's just that… Do you know where this is? Do you understand Korean? Huh? Can you understand? Oh, yes. Yeo Jin Goo is looking for his mother. When he was a young boy, he was taken away by some bad people. Then now he's trying to remember where his home is. Very good drama. Kid, will you get me some bones for Dookie? Yes. Your grandson is so cute. Brother, no need! Just take it. Thank you. She has a purple coat? This tall? She's a foreigner. Brother! He's looking for a woman this tall, a foreigner. Sounds like the woman that lives on the fifth floor. The noisy one. No, you don't get it, she doesn't live here. She's Singaporean-Chinese. A tourist. Is the woman on the fifth floor Chinese? I don't think so. Are there other guards around? They're off duty. Okay, thank you. Yes, bro? What a weirdo. No, not yet. No! Please don't do that, I'll find her. Don't call the boss. I'll call you. -Eon Sae! -Papa! What trouble did you get yourself into this time? Can I come in? I'm asking you, what trouble did you get yourself into? Can you just let me off? It's New Year's. I won't stay long, I have work anyway. Didn't I tell you not to come back? Mom, please! What are you going to do? Where is your customer now? Don't worry about it. I'm going to fix this. Eon-Sae, have you been good? Yes. No, she hasn't. What time is it now? It's long past your bedtime, and you still refused to go to bed. I hate you, I hate you! Papa… Kang Eon-Sae. She likes to say that she's going to live with Papa. Papa is the nice one. When Papa comes around, he gives her candy and presents. But Mother and I are the ones who scold her, bathe her, and force her to go to kindergarten. Eon-Sae, you! Don't talk to your mother like that, okay? Where do you sleep now? I crash at Hae In's place. That basement studio has space for two? Not really. It's a little tight. To open the fridge, you have to close the toilet door. But it's just temporary. I worked out a payment plan. I do back-to-back tours. They're paying me twice the rate because of New Year's. I did the math. I can pay what I owe in two months. In two months? Let's just tell the loan sharks to wait. Believe in me, Min-Young. After April, we can move out again, just the three of us. We can be happy. I can fix this. Please come in. Sit, sit. Dookie! Dookie! There you are. My dog, Dookie. Old, sick. You… China? Where? I… Singapore. Singapore, okay… I can speak Korean. Hello. Thank you. It's okay. Don't go. I love you. I love you? I love you. Your name? Woo Jung Su. You? My name? Lim Bee Hwa. Lim Bee Hwa. You come Korea… no family? My family? I have a son. He was supposed to come but-- I have one son. He never come. He's in America now. My son, one in Chicago, one in Busan. Two sons… You made this? Yes! I make… I like wood carving. That, that, and that too. You made all this? Wood. I carve it to make sheep. Dogs like Dookie… cats… Nice! Thank you. You? Me? What can I make? I don't know how to make anything. You sleep… there. There… heater… hot… okay? I sleep here. Okay? Okay. -Good night. -Good night. Dookie. Good dog. It was hard on you, Dookie. You made us happy. How have you been? What? He came last night? Okay, got it. No, no, no! Ajoomma, you don't need to do this. I'll do it. Just leave it. Handphone. We go back. My junior says the idiot tour guide came back last night. How should I say this? We go back, okay? Go back? Okay, okay. Get ready. Wait. This is driving me crazy. Wait! Hey! Are you the tour guide? Yeah. Yeah, I am. My colleague tried to send your tourist to Central Hotel last night. They're on their way here now. -I'm saved! Thank you! -It could have been a disaster. Just wait here, okay? -They should be here soon. -Hey! What are you doing? -Who are you? -What? Want to call the cops? Hurry up! -Stop it! -Yeah, call the cops now. Come on. It hurts. Can we talk this through instead, please? I got the money! I really got the money this time! You have to believe me. Let's go. Don't make things complicated. You like tteokbokki? Tteokbokki. I saw it on TV. Yeo Jin Goo ate tteokbokki. Ah, you saw it on television. Delicious. Don't you get what's happening? Huh? Your interest alone is 9 million won. You son of a bitch. Let's go. Please, I really need to use the restroom. Hey! Ajoomma! What the hell! -Sorry. -Get off! You knocked the bin over! -The tour guide! I saw him! -What are you saying? -Let me drive! Trust me! -Get out, get out! -I can drive very fast! -Get out, get out! -I can catch up with them! -Get into the car! Why is this Ajoomma doing this? Get in! We are all going to die! Ajoomma… You clean this up! I think I see the van! What are you talking about? Oh my God! That van! Mr. Tour Guide is inside! What? Mr. Tour Guide is inside that van! What are you talking about? I don't understand. Window down! -Down! -Window? Mr. Tour Guide! Who the hell is that? Who's tailing us? -Roll the window down. -Yes, sir. Mr. Tour Guide! What the hell are you looking at? Asshole, what the hell are you doing? Boss! Lock the door! You asshole! Stop! Stop the car! Come here, you asshole! Back up! Hurry, please… Drive. Drive! We're going to die like Dookie! Stupid kid! Why did you leave me behind? We're all going to die! I said just go! Who is he? The security guard from the place yesterday. I found a dead dog in his backseat. That is his pet dog, Dookie. It just died this morning. Poor thing. Your boyfriend? Crazy. Sorry. Why did we even stop at that place yesterday? I had to drop something off. For your family? Yeah. My daughter. Do you owe those men a lot of money? How much? Let's just say it's a lot. Your chin is bleeding. You want something for it? No, it's okay. Thank you. How long will the group be in Gangwon? The next four days. Four days in Gangwon? Visiting film sites. Can he join the tour group? If he drives us there quickly, I'll make an exception. Jung Su, you want to go to Gangwon? Has the ajoomma fallen for you, ajooshi? You… You no drive. I drive. Let's go. How's the chin? It stopped bleeding. Good. Got something you want to say? It was troublesome for you, wasn't it? To help Auntie. This kid… It's no trouble. So why did you help her? You don't even know her. Well, if you look at it from another angle, it's fate that we meet. So how can I close one eye? We can afford to be more compassionate. What? You got a problem with what I said, kid? No, no. I heard you. I get it. Go wait in the car. He wants us to wait in the car. How old is your daughter? Six. Six… When they're young, they need you more. They really do. Auntie, how old is your son? Around your age. A little taller than you. Not as talkative. Auntie used to work as a cashier. It wasn't much, but I liked working. When I had my son, I quit my job. I took care of Sam. My family. When my husband fell sick, I took care of him. When my mother fell sick, I took care of my mother too. Then my husband passed away. Soon, my mother passed away too. All the time given to them… Do you have any regrets? No. You're still young. You can still fix your problems. So you're saying I should go back and get killed? Can your family pay off your debt? You need to get a new job. Maybe it would be better for everyone if I disappeared. Your daughter will never forget it if you leave. Don't run away, got that? What is she doing…? On behalf of Sena Tours, I apologize deeply again for the mistake of my employee. Please rest assured that I'll take care of this matter properly and that it won't happen again. On behalf of Sena Tours, I apologize deeply again for the mistake of my colleague. Please rest assured that my boss will take care of this matter properly and that it won't happen again. Let me show you to your room, Auntie. Sir, please join us for dinner later at the restaurant. It will start in an hour. What the hell were you doing? Sorry. How did you get yourself into such a mess? The uncle has such a nice face. He helped Auntie so much. Right? Just one look and you know he's a good person. What happened? You're leaving? I go. Okay? Bye-bye. You go enjoy yourself. Do you wanna die? Do you wanna die? I want to live. Thank you. Thank you. Go home. Be happy. Okay? I don't understand. But okay! I can't, it's too tiring. You guys go ahead. That's right! Stand closer! Strike another pose! One more! Auntie! Your son is on the phone. Help take their photo. Ma! Hi, Sam. What happened? Luckily the Goddess of Mercy blessed me, and I'm fine. I heard you scream, and then the line got cut off. I'll buy you a new handphone when you come back. Okay, when we go back to Singapore. This tour company is terrible. We will never use them again. What about the tour guide? Did they fire him? They did. Good. He deserves it. At least nothing happened to you. Is it cold over there? It's okay… not as cold as Korea. -Ma… -Don't think too much. It's okay you didn't get the job. There will be better opportunities in the future. Still thinking about it? I have a friend from Singapore. He is moving here for work. We… We have been together for three years now. Ma… It's been three years? This is the one that drives the white car, right? I'm so old already. I've seen everything. This isn't my phone. I have to return it. I have applied for a visa so I can stay here with him. Ma… Let's talk about it when we go home. Bye-bye. Is anybody home? Hello? Anyone home? May I help you? Who are you? It's me, Mother. It's okay… you're home now. I will not lose you again. One, two, three. Sweet! Big Sister, let's connect via WeChat. Come visit us in Changchun next time. Will do. Auntie, take care. Bon voyage. -Bye-bye! -Bye-bye! Auntie, the check-in for your flight is not going to start for another hour. -You know where it is, right? -Yes. -You should go back first. -No, no… I know what to do, don't worry. Your family must be waiting for you. Okay. Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Ajoomma! Auntie, wait up! Auntie. I just wanted to say goodbye properly. Your daughter? Annyeonghasaeyo! Annyeonghasaeyo. She's so cute. Sorry, excuse me. Hello? Yes, she's with me. Ma! We are at the airport! No, no. I'm just saying goodbye to the customer. The ajoomma I left behind. Okay, I'm coming home right after this. Okay. My wife. She thought I'd run away with our daughter. A little something to bring home. Hangwa. Korean sweets. Thank you. I should get going. Be a good father. Bye-bye. Happy Lunar New Year! Take care. You take care too. Bye-bye. Go, go! Let's go. Where? In the cabinet. One second. The bottom cabinet? You have a lot of files. What color? Black. But you have so many black files. Parcel for Lim Bee Hwa. What did you buy? I didn't buy anything. Someone sent me something. Thank you. Did you get a raise? A little. I'm wondering if I should get a car. It's hard to get around here without one. I'd be broke if I took a cab every day. So, I have to take driving lessons. Why didn't I learn to drive before? Are you still listening? Hello? Hello? Ma! Yes, I'm listening. Can you take a photo of my certificate and send it over? Thank you! Turn left in front. Remember to turn on the signal. Everything was okay, but sometimes you forget to signal. Don't forget during the test and you'll be fine. Okay. I have many days to laugh I didn't realize that I don't cry even when I'm lonely I don't suffer, I'm going to live my life Putting on makeup with a new haircut I'll be born again into a cool woman More boldly with a little more confidence I won't cry ever again I will change for myself I'll start all over again From the beginning I'm gonna laugh out loud
