(joyless ambient music) (train screeches) (train trundles) (suspenseful electronica music) (moves into brooding electronica music) (train trundles) - [Man] Woman kissed dog, dog never brushed teeth. There's 2 billion people, and 50,000 mob. There's no end to this quarrel. (boys singing) * Sitting in comfort, our boss'll make a conclusion - Get 'em! * Stuck on the theory, then comes that crazy confusion * Thinking critically, but he cannot peek the illusion - Police are your friends. Because the police are your friends, you'll expect friendly fire. Like they say at headquarters, "Point blank!" (chuckles) Or as they like to say in the police report, "There was a struggle for the gun." (chuckles) - [Subway Operator] Ladies and gentlemen, because of inclement weather, the train to Mount Vernon has lower speeds. (melancholy cello music) - [Jacob] She's from Northern Nigeria. Muslim girl, her family's very conservative. But she was in her underwear on a table with a rope around her neck, her vagina was showing a little bit, and maybe one of her nipples was out, and just like, "Holy shit, this is crazy." (hauntingly menacing music) - [Subway Operator] There is an Uptown Express Three train to Harlem. Our number 3H train approaching the station. Please stand away from the platform edge. (contemplative cello music) - [Jacob] She pulled me over to the table after a few minutes and just started talking really quickly, like, "What's your name? (blathers)" I told her Jacob Cohen, and she said, "Oh God, a Jew?" And, "I can't talk to you." (deep, mournful cello music) I've been dating her for three years, which I think is pretty rare in New York. (bleak, troubled ambient music) (train whooshes) - [Subway Operator] 34, stand back, stand clear of the doors. (train whooshing) (train trundles) - [Carol] When I was in high school, I used to dream a lot about mermaids. They were never good mermaids, they were always evil. They were always doing something terrible, like... They were keeping children in cages, and they were tasering me and trying to get me to stay away from my family so they could kill my family. (moves into throbbing electronica music) (subway operator speaks on intercom) - [Subway Operator] Your next station stop will be Franklin Avenue. Stand clear of the closing doors, please. (train whooshing) - [Elijah] I love this girl. Once I first met her, 'til today, I still love her. But, she didn't want to be with me, so we broke it off. (train whooshes) (people chattering) (crowd chanting) To this day, if she wants me back, I'll go to her. - [Crowd] Two, four, six, eight! (crowd chants) (Elijah cheers) - [Yvette] The last, I wanna say, 15, 20 years, I've kept a journal. It helps me to reflect, it helps me to go back and see what I can fix, and I always write down mistakes so I won't keep repeating them. I trusted Rasheem, but he totally betrayed me from everything. He told me he wanted to marry me, he wanted to have children; it was all bullshit. The apartment and everything, he was gonna try and take it away from me and move somebody else in. Yesterday, I realized that the two times I found myself pregnant by Rasheem, they were on purpose, and he had already gotten two other women before me pregnant. I told the universe something has to change. I got on my hands and knees and I yelled out, "Please, I need to be released." Jesus, there is nothing like being alone. (train whooshes and trundles) (people chattering) (moves into pulsating elerctronica music) (moves into haunting ambient music) (subway train screeches) (train tracks clanking) - [Ethan] Life is a game where there's a constant supply of players and time. It goes on forever. Life is a game. The purpose for all of the players as a whole is to get a vast knowledge of what everything is like in the universe. (train crossing bell rings) ("Preludium cis-moll Opera 28 Number 10" by Frederic Chopin) (subway train trundles) (heavy, uneasy ambient music) (subway train screeches) - [Marcelo] The first date, I'll take her to wine bars and talk a lot, and now at the end, it's just like, "Damn, this 'be you' is expensive." So now, let's have coffee first, 'cause nobody takes more than two coffees. Now you are now connected, and it's so easy to know what you want, what you have. When I'm spending too much time on internet or researching for something that's not meaningful, like follow someone's gossipy porn websites, (radio announcer speaking in foreign language) anything that now I can spend two, three hours on the end, I stop to click, and then just like, "Damn." It's like I have a big bowl of ice cream. I feel like I want to throw up now. (rhythmic chillwave music) - [Ethan] One day, we're gonna be all gone. Our ideas will die, 'cause there'll be nobody to think them and pass them on. And in a way, we won't exist anymore, because nobody will remember us, nobody will have any proof of our existing. (moves into unsettling ambient music) (mechanical gears clicking) (train whooshing) (subway operator speaking over intercom) - [Subway Operator] 2030 line next, stay clear of the doors. (deep, uneasy music) (pulsating electronica music) - [Vitalik] Excuse me, my friend told me that I can fuck any girl around Coney Island, is it true? Hi, can I talk to you for a minute? Please? Any of you? - How can we help you? - Huh? - How can we help you? - I think you're really cute, so can I get someone's number here? - Yeah alright, no, that's not good. - No? Okay. (moves into tribal, percussive chillwave music) (train whooshes) (sparkling electronic music) - There's some girls, but... I could deal with it, but another thing is that they're 13 and there's nobody who's truly pretty. - Really? - Yeah, it's a problem. - None of the girls are pretty? - Yeah. Not really. - How about in the eighth grade? Well, I guess they'll be in the ninth grade, but you won't see them anymore. - And above that. Above seventh grade, there probably are, but... - So, something happens when they hit that age? - When they hit high school, they're probably gonna be pretty, but I don't... - You see any of the pretty girls in high school now? How about around our neighborhood, you see any girls who are pretty? Walking around? - There are definitely girls with a lot of confidence, but confidence doesn't necessarily make them pretty. - Good point. - And too many men confuse the two. - Men follow their penis. (Ethan laughs) - Nothing could be more true than that. Men follow their penis. - [Man In Black Shirt] Like their penis leads the way. (birds chirping) (heavy, troubled music) - [Ethan] The only place I feel really free is in my mind, alone. That's why I love being in nature, because there's nobody else with me and nothing's gonna happen, I can just think up free. I can just be. (moves into electronic reggae music) - [Sal] My definition of love is not about woman. It is about humility. If you got the humility in you, love is easy, you love everybody. * But the woman * She's just * Want to dance * She has grateful in her eyes (moves into pulsating electronic music) - I'm a hustler. I sold drugs, I been to jail, then it was homicide. I couldn't understand when people do something like that and they throw up. Didn't bother me. Damn, I ain't got no woman, I got a part-time girl. - So do I. That's what I got, a part-time girl. - And she's too far away to even talk about. She mighta sewed her shit. (men chuckle) She mighta sewed her thing up, man. We talk on the phone, she's in North Carolina. Put it this way, that's my babymomma. - Okay. Well, I got the same issue, 'cept for my lady, she in Ohio. - See, all our womens are far away. Except for him, his is... But yo, (blows raspberry) his love life is worse than ours. (men laugh) (subway train trundling) (deep, uneasy music) I was incarcerated, she sent me divorce papers. I paid a dollar to get divorced. That's my life. - [Alex] I've been single for a while now, and I, (moves into brooding ambient music) I wasn't really happy with the people that I was meeting organically at bars or parties. I just wanna meet someone that I can connect with, it doesn't have to be that serious, I just want to meet someone that I enjoy. I filled out my profile and was browsing through the matches they found for me. They ask you what kind of relationship you're looking for, what's the longest relationship you've been in, what are your religious views, what are your political views. And they ask you questions about your sex life. (moves into dark, sparkling piano music) Kenny was the fifth person I met. I met five people in one week. I'm in a new galaxy, a land of Kenny. Is it even allowed to be happy like this again? (moves into brooding ambient music) (subway train trundling) - [Subway Operator] 72nd Street, Central Park West. The A train to 207 Street, Broadway. 81st Street next, the A train to 207th Street; stand clear. (moves into drifting, nostalgic ambient music) (subway train trundling) (man clapping) - Get it, girl! Yeah! Be safe! (train screeches) - [Justin] I am legally blind, and the condition I have is called Stargardt macular degeneration. (people chattering) (dreamy, mysterious ambient music) (train whooshes) And basically, I see better peripherally, which means on the sides of my eyes. (birds chirping) Everyone I've dated so far has not wanted to be in a committed relationship, but I haven't dated that much. They don't seem to be looking for anything committed. (subway train screeches) (moves into brooding ambient music) - [Julka] You see only one picture, and if you're interested, you can click on that picture, and then, you can see other pictures, and then if he went fishing with a friend, or if he did something funny. I can check about 20 guys in one minute. (video game bleeps) I met Adam two days ago. First we went to have a drink in a club and then we went to his place. We were both complaining that everybody cares only about sex. (subway train whooshes) And then we went to bed. (chuckles) But we agreed that it was an exception and that it's a building block for our future relationship. Then I woke up at two in the morning and I saw Adam couldn't help it and he was checking if any other girl wrote him back. (moves into beaming, echo-ilke ambient music) (electronic circuitry whines) (woman chuckles) (subway train trundling) (throbbing electronica music) (subway operator speaks on intercom) (subway train whooshes) (deep, uneasy music) (cat hisses) (subway train whooshes) - [Bob] I tried to deny sexual feeling, because I thought if I express myself sexually, a woman would not want me. (subway operator speaks on intercom) - [Bob] I had a patient who was a biologist. She wasn't very attractive, and she talked about her husband and she talked about her work and she worked in a laboratory. I had an erection in the session. So the session's over, she leaves, I go to the bathroom, I relieve myself, and I just thought, "You know, my body is telling me something "that I have to be alive to, I have to consider it." (discomforting ambient music) (moves into calm, soothing electronica music) And it turned out that this patient had all of these sexual activities, rendezvous with strange men in hotels and motels all over town, behind her husband's back. She would be a prostitute, and it was a secret life that my body picked up the information on before she ever told me! (subway operator speaks over intercom) (train doors chime) (train rumbles) (faint voice echoes) - I never had enough sex, I never had enough relationship. Out of 365 days in the year, I think I was in a relationship for maybe seven days every two or three years. I have spent all my life trying to find a way to catch that again, to catch that feelings of excitement. So many times, I used to go out to the disco; so many times, I used to go to the clubs, looking, searching, to meet somebody. So many times getting dressed, so many times putting on the cologne, so many times coming home feeling lonely and empty. * Happy birthday to you * Happy birthday to you (group applauds) Every night, I go to bed thinking I may never meet another woman again, I may never be close to another woman again. Never. I would send out 100 messages to 100 different women and I wouldn't get any response. Nothing. And every time I would check the messages and see nobody responding to me, I'm thinking, "There's something with me? "This is terrible." And finally, after a couple hundred that I sent out and so exhausting, maybe I would get five or six responses. Out of all that, when I finally got the date, it took months, months and months to try to get a date, when I finally got the date, it was a disaster. (police siren wailing) I met a girl in a restaurant who was Italian and French, and beautiful, the most beautiful girl you can imagine, and I fell in love with her and she fell in love with me right away. We had the most powerful, this sexual fantasy relationship for two weeks in New York, sex everyday, all day long, and just until you cannot stay awake anymore, just this romantic time, and then she moved to Los Angeles and she disappeared for many years. (moves into veiled, intimate chillwave music) I learned that in life, if you try too hard, it works against you. Why do I need the younger girl? It's a status symbol. It's like a car. Do you want to have a nice Cadillac or do you want to have the shitty Chevrolet? This is the land of fantasy, and of bullshit, and Fantasy Island. I can't change my physical appearance, I can't change my age, I can't change my limitations, I have to accept my fate. I have to accept the misery of the reality of my life. (moves into soulless ambient music) (moves into pulsating nightclub music) - [Pat] I met him at a club. We were together for seven months. He's 26, I'm 56. He was my boyfriend and son. He beat me. Physically and mentally. I was on a bed and he whipped me with a strap. He smacked me so hard in my face, I got a black eye. He already pulled a knife on me. I wish I never met him, 'cause I went through hell for the seven months that I was with him. I want you to know that he beat me. - Wow. - So I want to whip his ass before he does move. But I don't want him to know that I had it done. - He don't gotta know. They don't know me, I don't know you, they don't know him, they don't know nobody. - So, the money's not the issue. The issue is what you're doing and what you're gonna do. (heavy, brooding ambient music) (plastic rustling) (Pat exhales) If he called me today and asked me to go back with him, I would. (heavy, brooding ambient music) - I believe that what I do, my job in my life, is to make people happy when I'm at work. (crowd cheers) For every dollar that you put in here, I will definitely say thank you. If you put five dollars in, I will suck your dick. (crowd cheers) If you put $10 in, I will suck your dick and a friend, and ladies, I will eat pussy for $10, everything. I'll do it. For $20, I will let you stick your dick in my sofa, I'm just saying. (crowd cheers) For that? I will suck your whole family off for that. The last relationship I was in was with someone who was married. (sensitive, bittersweet music) And we get in his truck, he starts driving and he just starts crying. And he says, "Don't fall in love with me." And in my mind, I'm thinking, "Too late for that, (chuckles) "I'm already there," but I didn't say anything. And the whole way, he just kept crying. I was like, "What just happened?" He was just, "Just please don't fall in love with me, "don't fall in love with me." I was driving home, and it hit me, it's like, "Oh my God, "he just told me he loved me and I didn't tell him," and when I immediately got off work, I hopped in the car and was driving to his place, and I didn't see his car. Turns out, that night, he packed up and drove back to New Mexico. That broke my heart. When you find that you can't sleep when that person's not there, it's just... I mean, this many years later, our relationship is over and I still think about this person every single day. I had to delete the phone number from my phone. That's love. (train screeches) (children chatter) (mechanical gears clicking) (train trundles) (spaced-out, floating chillwave music) - Your brain is gonna be telling you that you could fall, but you know, how many times have you fallen walking? - [Annabelle] I have. - Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Okay. - You have a wonderful picture of Lester. How long has that Lester been dead? - Eight years. - I was only married eight years. - You were married 30 years. - To Lester? - Yes. - Did he leave me anything? - Yes, he left you some money. - Where is it? - It's in the bank! Let's go. Let's sit next to Ethan right here. Mom, here, Mom. (moves into unsettling ambient music) (train whooshes) (train trundles) - Time's up! Pants off! You wasted my fucking time! And now I'm gonna rip it into all of you. Get to work! (moves into disquieting, humble music) (subway train horn blows) (tender, fragile music)
