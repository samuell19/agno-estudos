During the last part of the twentieth century... ...great advancements were being made in the field of genetic research. In England, it had been announced that a sheep had been successfully cloned. Secretly. The United States Government had been genetically creating... ...animals for more than a decade. Banodyne Industries had been commissioned to design... ...and bring into being an alternative to traditional military thinking. AE-73 and AE-74 were designed and conceived for this purpose. The super-intellectual AE-73 looked like a normal golden retriever... ...while his counterpart AE-74, was considered an unsuccessful attempt. It was hoped that the symbiotic team of intelligence gatherer and precise killing machine... ...would allow that American soldiers would never again have to die in the field. By deploying bio-genetic creations, human interaction would be kept to a minimum... ...and the enemy would be swept away. But something went terribly wrong. Einstein. Einstein. Where's Einstein? Get out. Get out. Get out. We've gotta find the dog. Get out. I've gotta find the dog. No. Barnes, what's your twenty? Barnes, here. Uh, all clear up at the reptile house. Why don't you head on over to the petting zoo? Robertson can't remember whether or not he left the security door open. I'm all over it. One of these days, Robertson's gonna forget to breath. Who's there? Hey, hey. What are you tryin' to do? Break in? Easy. Easy. Easy. I'm not gonna hurt you. I, I got a little guy just like you at home. What's the matter? Hey, hey, you can't just run around in here. What the hell was that? Uh, Barnes, here. I... I've got an animal loose in the area. Barnes, I didn't catch that last... No. Oh, God, no. Nooooooo. While officials remain silent, at least one individual... ...a zoo security guard, was killed. Police are unwilling to speculate at this time to the motive of the killing... ...or even whether the perpetrator was man or animal. How was that, John? Brody. Homicide. Oh, yes, Detective. Right through there. Yeah. Mornin'. Good mornin', gentlemen. I hope you haven't eaten. Why? You servin'? Uh, not today... ...but a couple of the blues really got the dry heaves from this one. What the hel is this? Somebody figure it out, it'd make my job much easier, you know? Uh, it's some kind of ape, or whatever. It's Pan Satyrus. It'a a chimpanzee from the rain forests of equatorial Africa. Gus, I'm impressed. So, I've been watching too much Sports Center and not enough discovery channel. Animals aren't my thing. People are. Right. Well, check this out. Out clear through to the spinal column. Probably already dead. Most of this damage is post mortem. Is this some kind of ritual killing? You mean a human perp? No. This wasn't done with a knife. It's too jagged. Most of it was blunt force. He was literall bashed to bits with a tremendous amount of force. Well, an animal must've gotten loose. Uh, a lion, a bear, maybe. No. That would be too tidy. I mean, all the prisoners are still in their cages. So, what are we left with here, uh, the process of elimination? Uh, a mountain lion with a baseball bat? What? Hey. All I do is put the bodies on ice. It's up to you guys for the interpretation. What are you lookin' at? I thought I noticed something up there. Me too. You'd probably do better with a shovel, fellows. I'll take another look at the body. Maybe I can come up with somethin' else. That'd be nice, Doc, 'cause you weren't a damn bit of help. Thanks a lot, Gus. That's cold. Listen, Murph? If I have a chance... Talk to the guards again, will you, Gus? We've gotta have something' for the report. Excuse me. May I help you? No, I don't think so. I'm gonna have to ask you to stop what you're doing, ma'am. This is a crime scene. Oh, what can I do for you, officer? Well, you can start out with your name. Dr. Hudson. Grace. I'm with the zoo. I'm the staff zoologist. Telephone? Is this personal or business? What does it look to you? Telephone? Five-five-five, two-three-seven-eight. Let me ask you somethin', Doc. What kind of an animal drags its prey around and covers up its own tracks. A smart one. Excuse me? Nothing. Man's the only animal capable of that. Hmm. I've never seen a man kill like that. Hey, hey, hey. What are you doin'? I'm sorry, you can't... You're gonna leave this area for now. Yeah, I'm finished here, anyway. No. Do you know how close you just came to getting shot? Now, go on. Beat it. Look, I... I'm on the clock here, so... What, are you lost? Is that your deal? Here. Come 'ere, boy. Come 'ere. Oh, no collar. Great. Listen, you. I got a little too much on my mind to deal with a stray with no ID, okay? So, you know. I mean... All right. All right. Shut up. You're givin' me a headache. Okay, you win. I'm comin'. Coming. I know you have been working on something top secret down there, but come on. Don't tell me I'm going on a duck hunt if the woods are full of bears. I want to know... ...how afraid should I be of this AE-74? Unfortunately, very. AE-74, or 'the Outsider' as I started calling him... ...was genetically engineered for the military... ...to be the second half of a search-and-destroy team. The destroy part. Right. He was designed to work in an empathic partnership with a golden retriever AE-73. They're psychically linked. Genius. Whose idea was that? Mine. We made the dog in the lab, too. It's probably smarter that half of you. We didn't make a Frankenstein and set him free, Doc. I was trying to fix the Outsider, to cure him. His problems were from flaws in his design. My design. What is that? Is that human? He's too angry today. Okay. Take it easy there, folks. We don't want to hurt ourselves. You're sure it's us that you're worried about? Research assistants are about a dime a dozen, and AE-74 is priceless. You do the math. All right. Let's put him down. Come on, Einstein. Okay, let's go on 'three'. Ready? One... ...two, three. Einstein? What's wrong? Hey, what's gotten into you? Hey. Remove the cage. It's easy for you to say. Okay, well, I'll back you up from over here. You wimps, there's enough sedatives in this thing to keep a lion down. Come on, Einstein, you've had a long day. Some sleep's gonna do you good. All right, in you go. Ahhh. You don't want me to close it. Do you want me to leave it open till you go to sleep? Good. One for 'yes'. Now... ...let's just make sure. Do you want me to close it now? Good boy. Two for 'no'. - Hi. - Hi. Okay. Vital signs are slowing, stabilizing. 74's sleeping like a baby. All right. Let's scrub up and get to work. Prep the cranial saw. Ready, Doctor. Keep an eye on its vitals. B.P. And heart rate are stable. Ah. There's another one of them. You all can see that? That's one more of the brain lesions we're after. - Got you. You miserable little... - It just looks like the rest of his brain. Maybe. But these lesions obstruct his functions. His memory, his spatial judgment... ...his reasoning capacities they make him disoriented... ...basically, a schizophrenic. Okay. Close him up. Once he heals, his brain should be re-integrated. Finally, we'll be able to rehabilitate him. So he goes to sleep barely functional and wakes up a stranger to himself. It could be a bumpy ride. Hmm. Time heals all wounds. I'm beat. I'll give you five bucks if you can. I'll give you ten. That's too long. Please? Oh-oh. What's up? His brain waves are erratic. There's an increase in density, and frequency is off the scale. In other words, he's pissed. - Go get Dr. Hudson. - Right. What's going on in there? 74 broke free. He's tearing the place apart. Let's get hom more anesthetic into him, and we've got to immobilize him before he does damage to his brain. No. No, 74. No. No. Now, he's probably out there somewhere tracking the dog. Okay. Maybe they'll destroy each other. Save us the trouble. The dog will avoid the Outsider at all cost... because he can sense the Outsider's jealousy and hatred. All right. We'd better get this thing before the press does. We'll probably have more luck catching the dog 'cause he won't run from us. We get it... ...and use it as bait for the Outsider. What do we do with them when we catch them both? Orders are to terminate the project. All of it. Now, remember. You so much as breath a word of this to any civilians, you might as well shoot 'em dead on the spot. This information has the highest classification. Do you want to stop on the way in, drop Fido off at his new home? I, I swear, I don't know, I don't know how I worked with you all these years. Well, it's the yin and the yang, my friend. How could you even think about takin' a great dog like that to the pound? Yeah. You call that a great dog? The four-legged flea bucket? You hear that? He understands, huh? He knows. Maybe not the specifics, hah, but he knows you got no heart. Yeah. If he knew anything about human nature, he would have gone after a sucker like you. No, no. He left that up to you. Oh, yeah. Like he understands. He's along term thinker? Come on, let's take him to the pound. Who are you kiddin'? You know, if I was to take him to the pound, you'd fight toe to toe in the middle of the street... ...before you'd let me drop him off. Come on, that's a load of crap. And you knew that I'd take the dog home. Which is something you'd do if you weren't so terrified of being responsible for something. What are you doing? Are you gonna start analyzing me again? No, Murph. No, I'm not. I'm just kidding. - No, you're not. - No, I'm not. Oh, come on. Let's drop it. Just drop it. I know you don't want to talk about this. Meaning what? That I should want to? Yes. You are not responsible for Christina's death. Not responsible. You got that, partner? Got it. Oh, bullshit. You know somethin', Murph? In four years... four years, I haven't seen you laugh once. Not once. You like that, huh? I like it, too. Yeah, you're a good boy. Yeah, you're a good, good boy. What do you got out there, bud, huh? What do you got, a squirrel? What? What the hell's the matter with you? Hey. This may not be the Taj Mahal, but it's home. What's goin' on? 'Danger'. Danger? What the hell is going on? Hold it. Don't move. I'm a police officer. No. Clear the area. Come on, folks. Unless you've seen something. I'm gonna have to ask you to get back. No ma'am. Hey. Listen up. Everybody in here. Come on, come on, get outta here. None of this. Come on. Come on. This is Agent Johnson, and he and his men are going to be taking over from this point on. What? Right. Everybody just drop whatever you're doing, let it go, and just walk away. What just a goddamned second. - And you are? - Agent Johnson, Detective Murph. You want to tell me what the hell's goin' on here? No. Well, I think you're gonna have to. I got a partner in there lyin' in pieces. Now, somethin's up, and I want to know what the hell's goin' on. Federal agent, L.A. Cop. You got it? And I don't owe you anything but the opportunity to get out of my way... ...before it becomes a problem for you. Jesus Christ. Hold it. Let him go. Listen, please, accept the Department's apology. Detective Murphy is way out of line and rest assured we will have disciplinary action taken. Shut up. No, you won't. Mr. Murphy... Now, let's get to work. Aw, Jesus. You're about to take a little mental health time off... ...effective immediately. You need some rest. What the hell? Where did you come from, huh, boy? You been hidin' out back there, huh? Ooo. Looks like you got off better than Gus. Let's get you home, okay? Come on, let's go. Okay. Come on, scrounge-meister. Come on. Well, you're gonna have to excuse the mess. I really wasn't expecting company. Make yourself at home, bud. First business, I'm gonna get that cut of yours looked at. I want to know what, uh, would cause an incision like that. Hey, hey, hey. Will you give me a break? It's for your own good, too. Come on. Hello? Hi. This is, uh, Detective Murphy. Uh, I met you at the crime scene at the zoo the other day? Yeah, I remember. It's not exactly business hours, is it, Detective? No, sorry. Well, you know, there's really no hours in my business. Uh, listen, I could use your help. See, uh... ...my partner was killed today. Yeah, I heard. I'm, I'm sorry. It's not your fault. Anyway, I, I picked up a stray, and, uh... ...he seems to have been injured by whoever, whatever killed my partner. Um, where, where are you, Detective? Two-three-oh-three-seven, Lancaster. Okay, I'll be right there. Well, you want directions? No-no, I'll, I'll find you. Just stay put. Oh, my God. Well, we've got a real animal lover on our hands. She's on her way over. You're gonna like her. She's kind of cute... for a scientist. Hey, hey, hey. What? You hungry? Well, I've got some leftovers in the fridge. You want to split 'em? I guess so. Did you? How the hell did you manage that? I'll get back to you. What? Grace Hudson's disappeared. Aw, shit. We should've iced that bitch first. You're pretty well trained, aren't you? What's on your mind? I'm gonna have this last piece. That's okay with you, isn't it? Do you mean you want it? Would you like to go to war... and die? But you would like this chicken. Yes. Here, take it. It's yours. And the gravy. A dog that understands English. Jesus, I need a drink. Ein? Who the devil are you? I'm losin' my mind. I'm not, am I? You understand everything I'm saying. And your name is Einstein. And you were there when my partner was killed. And you're gonna help me find the killer, right? Right? Hey. What's the matter, boy? What? You don't want me to answer the door? I have to. I called her over here. We're gonna get that cut looked at. Just a second. What's the matter with you? This is my house, so get away. - The doctor is here. - Thanks for your coming. It's a deep gash. What would cause an irregular cut like that? An animal? Oh, maybe. Maybe just, uh... irregular object. Jagged glass. He's lucky it didn't hit an artery. You hear that, Einstein? You're lucky. You got that 'you-got-wacked-but-not- enough-to-kill-you' kind of good luck. Looks like you could use a little medical attention yourself. Mmm. Beer cure. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't even offer you one. Oh, no thanks. I insist. Hey, you're gonna need it to swallow the story I've got for you. Hey, I want you to come with me. I'll hide you. They're not going to let you live. What would you say... ...if I told you that dog was smart. I mean, like, real smart. You know, Murphy, people tend to boast about the abilities of their kids and their pets. It's only natural. No, no, no. It's not like that. I'm not like that. Hey, I don't even like dogs. Sorry, pal. Well, I'll take him off your hands, then. I can put an ad in the paper and see if his previous owners respond. Hey, whoa, boy. Take it easy. It looks like he's not too hot to go back to his former owners. What do you mean? He understood everything you said. Right. And that's the beer you were drinking. No, I'm not drunk and I'm not joking. Watch this if you don't believe me. Watch. Here. Watch this, Grace. If you think that demonstrating he's house broken is gonna convince me, uh... Einstein? Watch this. Einstein? Bring me the business section. Watch this. Well, I'm sorry for ever doubting you. That is quite a dog. I don't understand. Something's wrong. Okay, watch, Grace. Now, one bark is 'yes'. Two barks is 'no'. Einstein? Am I a detective? Maybe he thinks you're a lunatic, Murphy. You've had a terrible day. You're physically and mentally beat up. You need some rest. That's just what my captain told me. Well, he's right. Look, I'll take the dog off your hands. I can give him a better home than you can now. I-I don't think so, Grace. But listen, I really want to thank you for coming over and taking a look at him. Really. Thanks so much. That was sudden. I guess I'm just... you know, a little tired. Uhh, um... Mm, Murphy? Be careful. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. This is special agent Johnson. Please, leave the message at the beep. What? Let go of me, Einstein. Let go. What's going on? Get out of the way. Get out of the way. What's the matter with you? Stupid dog. Jesus. Stupid dog. Nine-one-one operator. What's your emergency? No. Stop. Easy. What the hell was that? You'll have to handle the cops. Handle them? What do you mean? Just get rid of them long enough for me to figure out what to do. Uh, okay. Cover the police for me. You gotta do this for me. Just make something up. Is everything all right here? Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. Listen, uh, she got run off the road by a couple gangbanger. They headed south on Laurel. What is this, some kind of initiation? Must be the latest thing. You take over the pursuit, I'll handle the scene. You got it. I'll call for back-up. Listen. We've got about five minutes before another car arrives. Why don't you tell me what the hell's going on here? If I tell you, I... I will be putting you in more danger. How are you gonna stop being attacked by Bigfoot? Okay, I'll tell you everything. But first, we have to get rid of the car. You think that's thing gonna run? I don't want them to know that I was here. All right. You got any ID in there? No. No. I have, I have my things here. All right, move away. Come on, move. I need matches. All right. Okay, get out of the way. Get out of the way. You're a strange woman. Tell me about it. Einstein. Einstein, where are you? He may have taken off. He's afraid of the Outsider. Outsider? I'll tell you later. Look, let's just get outta here before anybody or anything comes back. Wait, wait. I got a place we can go. It's up in the mountains away from anybody. Okay. But let's hurry. Are you still there? Don't hang up. Stay on the line. Your call has been traced, and help is on its way. Did you do that? You saved my ass. He doesn't trust me. Should I? Come on you two. Let's get outta here. Move. Where's the dog? Where's Einstein? No, 74. Don't look. Don't look. Feel his presence. No. Look. Feel his presence. Feel it. Einstein. Einstein. Einstein. What a bunch of pigs. Somebody should teach those girls something about personal hygiene. The dressing room was filthy. Yeah. Every night this place gets... And I'm finding it really hard to stay afloat. I guess you must've had something on the side. ...you do. What can I say, baby? I care. Who'd be up at this time of night? Beat it. We're closed. Louie. That's 'Mr. Louie', sweetheart. Good evening, Duke. What are you doin' here? My representatives will be paying you a visit tomorrow evening. I'd like to know that they're welcome. We've been through this before, Louie. Nobody's sellin' dope in my place. That is a stupid attitude. I suggest you alter it. It will be a pity for yet another member of your family to die so untimely. Please listen to him, Duke. Oh, smart girl. When my people arrive... ...you will, uh, treat them with courtesy and respect. Any of your pushers show up here, and I'll call in the cops. You leave me no choice. No. What the hell is that ugly thing? There's like nothin' up at the cabin. Not even coffee. We're gonna have to stock up here. How much further is it? Oh, about a mile. Good. Hey. Come on, Einstein. I know you're hungry. Come on. Do you prefer sodium nitrate and animal fillers or beans? Whatever you want, dear. How'd you teach him to do that? Oh, are you kidding? We didn't teach him to eat crap like that. He picked it up on his own. He's a great dog. Oh, come on. We're not gonna stay week. Hey, we may be hiding out, but I am not roughing it. It's shameless, isn't it? Don't you wish you just could go up to a total stranger, and get him to scratch your neck like that. What do you mean? You can't? He is a great dog. Oh, you don't know him. He's actually very conceited. He thinks he's a genius. The dog's biggest problem was that he was too successful. Yea, that's always been my problem. The more the dog progressed, the farther the Outsider fell behind. There was this intense sibling rivalry that turned lethal. Cain and Abel. The Outsider won't stop until he tracks down Einstein and kills him. Anyone, anyone that's even had contact with the dog. Well, you saw what happened to Gus. What about the N.S.A. goons? They plan on terminationg the project which includes Einstein. I can't let that happen. He's practically a person. Considering the kind of human contact he's had, I'd call that an insult. Ouch. I take it that was aimed at me. Hey, you know what I don't need? I don't need a lecture on compassion from a woman that's been genetically engineering the ultimate killing machine. Okay. And in wartime... ...would you rather have the Outsider fighting in hand-to-hand combat, or your son? Daddy. Daddy. Sam? Christina. Dad, where are you? Dad. Sam. Daddy. Oh, no. Daddy. Daddy. Murphy. Hey. I was practically in the middle of a sentence there, and you just checked out. Poof. My son died four years ago of a fire in our home. Murphy? His mom didn't make it, either. I tried to save 'em. I just... I didn't make it. So many things in life slip through your fingers. Uh, a relationship here, a promotion there... ...but in the end... ...none of it really matters. You just... ...you know, you pick yourself up. You, uh, you keep on going. But, you know, that night... ...I stumbled, and I never got up. Oh. Oh. Tuna breath. Egh. Down. Oh, please. Enough. So, was this place somewhere you came with your family? No. I got it after. Gus and I used to come here to fish. Unlike AE-74, AE-73, his canine counterpart, or 'Einstein'... ...as he's commonly referred to, exhibits advanced social skills. Preferring the company of people to that of other dogs... ...he seems to enjoy interacting with his handler... ...specifically that of his mentor Dr. Grace Huds... Yeah, that's it. She's the key. If we want to find the dog, we've got to find the girl. Okay... ...so, what's the plan here? Well, obviously, you have to stay away from the N.S.A. boys. You don't have to do any more that you've already done, Murphy. I think Gus would expect more of me than that. I expect more of me than that. Well, I guess we have to convince Einstein, then. How about it, 'E'? Are you ready to go out and find the Outsider? You know the deal. If we don't get to him, he's gonna find us. I promise. I'm not gonna let anything hurt you. But you're gonna have to help us find this thing. Thanks. What, you're looking forward to a life on the run? You... So, tell me again. What is it that you thought you saw? I don't know what the hell it was. It was a monster. - Or a creature. - Right. Well, what did you see the monster do? Did, did you see where it went? No. We didn't hang around too long after it ripped a guy's off. We decided to leave. Tell me... Could you describe this thing if you had to? Oh, yeah. That's face I'm not gonna forget for the rest of my life. I'm sorry to hear that. I guess this just isn't your day. You want to tear my eyes out. Why? So I can't see you? Why don't you want to be seen? Ugly? You think you're ugly? Jesus. Why'd they have to make him look so goddamned ugly? It seems, at first, it just happened that way. But later, they worked at it to make it uglier. Give it an advantage in combat. Scare the hell out of the enemy. Clever. Lem? There's been an incident off Laurel... ...very close to Detective Murphy's house. Let's go take a look. Let's go, guys. Sorry, but there's only one bed. So, what did you and Gus used to do? Mm, we used to take turns on the coach. I'll take the coach. Let me get a pillow. Hey, it's not a problem. It's not a problem. I wasn't expecting that. Oh, yeah. Right. There's only one bed. Oh, no. No, I didn't it. Sorry, pal. Three's a crowd. I'm a little out of practice. I think I can remind you. There was definitely a dog here. Abel, come here. Give it to me. Lem? You should have a listen to this. There was a 911 call made from this house last night. - Yes. - Superviser, who's this? This is special agent in charge Johnson. - The tape I think you should... - Yeah, go ahead. - There's about five minutes and it... - Play it for me. Einstein. Einstein, where are you? He may have taken off. He's afraid of the Outsider. The Outsider? I'll tell you later. Look, let's just get outta here before anybody or anything comes back. Wait, wait. I got a place we can go. It's up in the mountains away from anybody. Okay. But let's hurry. As I was saying, there's about five minutes of what seems to be a dog panting. We dispatched aid immediately... People. We're looking for the address of a cabin in the mountains, probably just north of here. Get it fast. Tear the place up if you have to. Come on, rip it up. Get Captain Dekker on the phone. See if he knows where the cabin is. Did you get a good night sleep? What? You got a problem with the great outdoors? You're ready? We'll go gunning. We're not gonna hide. I'm gonna face this thing down. Hey, what is it, Einstein? Oh, no. I think he's afraid. No. No, it's not that. He is psychically linked to the Outsider. He wants to wait here. He must know that 74 is going to come here, looking for us. Einstein wants to wait for him. It's too risky. I prefer to keep movin', stay ahead of the N.S.A. guys. 74 must be close. All right. Let's get some supplies together. Better move to a more fortified position. It's about fuckin' time. Okay, ladies, come on, we're losing valuable light, right? Shape up. I want you over here right now. We'll proceed from here on foot. The cabin is about a mile up the road. I want to make them by surprise. And our orders, sir? Capture the dog. Now, listen up, gentlemen. This is a micro-transceiver- homing-projectile unit. We tag Fido with it, and then we track him. That son-of-a-bitch can move like lightning. The others, shoot to kill. Lem, come on. They're both privy to the fact that a government experiment has backfired and is killing civilians. This kind of information isn't fit for public consumption... ...no matter what the cost. Okay, let's go, ladies. Move it out. Come on, come on. Einstein. Einstein. No, you asshole. I'm trying to be serious here. No, as a matter of fact, I have not been smokin' anything yet today. I don't know if these guys are cops or gangsters or what the hell they are. All I'll tell you what. They were packing some kick-ass fire power, too. What's wrong? All right. Deploy in a perimeter and search the area until we find them. Go, go. We're surrounded. We've gotta give ourselves up. No way. That guy had orders to shoot. They're not gonna let us live. Are you sure about that? Murphy, they're here to kill us and take Einstein. We have no choice. None at all. It's all right. We're gonna take 'em on all together. Let him get close. This is crazy. We're not gonna make it. Take Einstein in the car. I'll cover you and meet you outside. Murphy. We don't have the firepower to take on the entire N.S.A. and the Outsider. Now go. Move. Move. Come on, Einstein. Go for it, you furry freak. Einstein. Knock it off. All right. Run. Get outta here. Get outta here. No, 74, I order you. No. Obey. No, 74. No, 74. No. No. Got you. What's wrong? You want to go for a ride? I can't take you home. I got too many damn dogs at home as it is. Enough to kill me. Now, you go go on home now, all right? Go on home, now. Go on. Get. What the hell hit me? Was it a bullet? Where's Grace? Did the Feds get her? The Outsider? Oh, my God. Is she dead? Okay, she's not dead. Are you sure? Oh, man, we're not goin' anywhere in that thing. Einstein, do you know where she is? Okay. Do you know what direction she went in? No, 74. No. Hey, what do you say we take our chances? We're not going to get anywhere like this. Stop. Police officer. And his dog. Thanks for stoppin'. Oh, sure, officer. Uh, it's a pretty empty stretch of road. I really wasn't expecting, uh... We're gonna need your car. Oh, yeah. Me, too. I, I, you know, I... You drive, We'll ride back. Oh, sure. Of course. He still goin' in the right direction? Yes or no? Oh, oh, you don't know. - Unbelievable. - Hey, just drive, will you? We're lost, aren't we? Afraid? You're talking. That's good. What'd you see boy? Did you see her? Back up the car. Stop. This... this is ridiculous. - Just do it. - I'm turning. I'm turning. Now get out. What the hell? That's, uh, that's an orange, Officer. Shut up. This means something. Trust the dog. Let's get out of here. Move. Pet me. It's a trail. She left us a trail. Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course. I mean, you know, gee, who wouldn't want you to see the two of you again. Would you shut up and follow the oranges? Say, uh, I don't suppose that that has something to do with you? Just remember, I've got a gun pointed right at you. What's that? Hm? Oh, that's, uh, that's a bunch of oranges. Here. Easy, buddy. Ah. It's okay. It's okay. It's really good for you. Go on, wise ass.

Not us. Go on, Einstein. You can get out, outta here. Dog. You so much as stretch anything between your smelly legs, I'm gonna shoot 'em off. I wish I could say this has been a pleasure... ...but you have been a royal pain in the ass. You and freak cost me my whole unit. Trained men. For nothing. No. Look what you made me do. Murphy. Murphy. Christina. Sam. Murphy. Murphy. Murphy. There's no way out. It's gonna blow. Let's go home. Four souls came together that night.
