Have your tickets ready! Tickets for the toyland express, ho, ho! [Slurping] Oh. (Spoon giggling) Oh! Home from the honeymoon? Time to settle down and raise a few place settings of your own, huh? [Laughing] *[humming] [Mr. Dumpty scatting] *[humming] Ow! [Groaning] Oh, no! A sky is falling! Hey! Get down from there, kiddo. Well, you could fall. And crack your, uh, your, uh... Oh, you know. [Laughing] Whatever people have instead of shells. Well, hello there. I bet you babes are headed for toyland. Yes, sir. Woofy and I can't wait. I can. How much longer, please? Oh, not long. From here on in, it's non-stop. [Exclaiming] [Sighing] [Gasping] I bet it's a cow! I bet it's a giant prehistoric lizard. [Razzing] Hey. Hey, you! Don't you know the difference between a train track and a sidewalk? (Mr. Dumpty) Tom, Tom, the Piper's son. Ho! Hi, Mr. Dumpty. Good brakes. [Chuckles] Hey, uh, can I hitch a ride? Thomas, you should have been back days ago. The whole town's upset. And Mary is worried sick. Well, I was on my way home and making great time when-- [gasping] She is, huh? Well, anyway, I was flying over the goblin forest, when someone shot down my hot-air balloon. Goblin forest? [Exclaiming] You're lucky you didn't land in one of their stew pots. Ooh! (Both) Huh? Well, climb aboard. We've gotta get you home, Thomas. Time's a wastin'. [Train whistle blowing] (Mr. Dumpty) All aboard! All aboard! (Tom) Hi, folks. Nice day. Oh, a window. Yeah. This'll fit right here. [Tom whistling] Hi. Nice haircut. Whoa! [Train chugging] (Mr. Dumpty) I'm okay. No harm done. How're you doing? I'm Tom. I'm Jill, and this is my brother Jack. Huh! Jack and Jill! Nice to meet you. Mmm. Do you live in toyland? [Laughing] Does a bear like his porridge just right? I'm only the, uh, chief executive toymaker of the whole place, that's all. Uh, uh, you know, I don't like to brag. [Chuckling] Since when? Yeah, you're right, Mr. Dumpty. What the heck. They got a huge factory with big machines and 100s of workers report to me. [Yawning] Oh. And I'm a very close personal friend of Santa claus. Yeah. And I know the easter bunny. (Tom) Well, the big man himself gave me his entire toy order for this Christmas. [Gasping] Here, Jack. For you. [Scoffing] Oh. Ok. I'll save it for later. Mr. Piper? What's toyland really like? I bet it's not as good as people say. Yeah, you're right. It's better! [Train whistle blowing] See for yourself. Jack, come on. Wait. [Jill grunting] (Mr. Dumpty) Now arriving at toyland station! Toyland station! [People chattering] [Robots beeping] (Mary) Tom. Tom! [Lamb bleating] Look. It's Mary and her little lamb. Hey, Mary. Mr. Dumpty wired ahead. Thank goodness you're ok. You, uh, were going nuts without me, weren't you? I was going nuts without Santa's toy order. Oh. Yeah, right. Right. That. Presenting the biggest toy order toyland has ever seen. Let me see. Are you sure you weren't worried about me? Just a little, huh? Tom! Not in the least. But you should worry that there are only-- 3 days till Christmas Eve. So? Thank you. Oh, Mary, this is Jill and Jack. Pleased to meet you. You gotta be the most beautiful lady in the whole world. And you are a very sweet little girl. Are you Tom's girlfriend? [Scoffing] I'm his boss. [Scoffing] But I think she'd rather be my girlfriend. Oh, right. When cats play fiddle. *[violin playing bridal chorus] Oh. Oh. Ooh. [Tom laughing] What do you know? He's playing our song. [Scoffing] Come along, Mr. Piper. As papa used to say, it's toy time. Be right there, boss. Is somebody picking you up? We're supposed to live with an uncle, one we never met. He probably doesn't even know we're comin'. Oh, I could take you. (Mr. Dumpty) Oh, no, you won't, Thomas! [Laughing] You heard Mary. Get to that factory on the double. I'll take these babes home. Hey, you guys, stop by the factory tomorrow, and I'll give you the chief executive toymaker tour. Great. We'll be there. Tom's nice. Why doesn't Mary like him? Oh, she's crazy about him. Everybody in toyland knows it but her. [Train whistle blowing] Aah! [Chugging] (Mr. Dumpty) Ok, kids. Follow me. [Panting] I'm finally going to see toyland. (Jack) Big deal. [People chattering] [Car horn honking] (Child) There he is! [Bicycle bell ringing] Whee! [All chattering] [Seal honking] [Unicycle squeaking] [Flash popping] Kind of grabs you, doesn't it? It's... Oh, it's wonderful. Well, sure. Whoo, it's toyland! * toyland, toyland * little girl and boyland * land of love and laughter * once upon a dream come true * * childhood's joyland [snoring] * mystic, merry toyland * just believe as children do * * and toyland is there * for you my sausages! I'll get you! [Screaming] Oh, oh, oh. [Yawning] (Chorus) * toyland * toyland * little girl * and boyland [Jack and Jill laughing] * childhood's * joyland * mystic, merry * toyland * just believe * as children do * and toyland is there for you * [giggling] [Both sighing] [All cheering] Wow! What a number. Now, let's get you home. What's your uncle's name? Uncle barnaby. Uh, barnaby crookedman? [Whimpering] [Thunder rumbling] [Crow cawing] (Jill) Oh, no! And I thought the orphanage was a dump. [Crow cawing] Maybe it's nicer on the inside. That's the spirit, honey. But don't count your chickens... [Children screaming] (Mr. Dumpty) Down, boy! Keep your trap shut. A-Are you sure this is uncle barnaby's house? Get away. Get away. No solicitors. Oh, open up, barnaby. I've brought someone to meet you. It's US, uncle barnaby, Jack and Jill. What are "a Jack and Jill"? (Mr. Dumpty) Your nephew and niece. [Both gasping] Hmm. They've come to live with you. Oh, I've a much better idea. Toss 'em in the river. Not so fast, barnaby. These kids are your family now. You are all they've got. And didn't you get a copy of the letter? I never read mail. Might be good news. Here, uncle barnaby. [Barnaby grunting] "Parent's gone." "Only living relative." "Nowhere else to go..." Blah, blah, blah, blah. Oh, how very touching. [Door slamming] (Jill) What do we do now? [Gasping] "Enclosed you find money, to pay for their keep." Children! Welcome home. [Coins clinking] [Exclaims] Scramble, egghead. Beat it. Egg-zit. [Whining] Oh, dear. Those poor kids. Yes. [Laughing] [Chuckling] [Gasping] (Barnaby) Don't touch that! [Alarm bell buzzing] [Scat yowling] Oh! Oh, i-I'm sorry. If you children expect to remain in this house, you had better listen and learn. I detest fun, I appall laughter, I despise noise, I abominate music, I anathematize candy. But above all, the one thing I truly hate the most is toys! Woofy! [Meowing angrily] [Scat screeching] Ha! That's enough. [Both gasping] [Caterwauling] [Groaning] Oh, I suppose I have to store you somewhere. This way. (Jack) Whoa! Look. Food. You won't be needing dinner. But we--we are hungry, sir. Good. [Groaning] (Jack) Great. He's gonna starve US. What a jerk! Shh. Don't make him mad. [Meowing] Uncle barnaby. Uncle barnaby? [Scat meowing] When may I have woofy back, please? Never. No toys in my house. (Jack) Better keep on his good side. Now, here we are. Your, uh, accommodations. [Rats squeaking] (Jack) Hey. Now, get in there. And don't disturb the rats. They were here first. Uncle barnaby, good night. Off, off. Good night. Down. (Jack) Got it. Uh, down. Release! Now, one peep before morning, and I'll feed you to the goblins. [Scoffing] [Scat screeching] [Gasping] Woofy! Hang on to him, will ya? I don't want to have to do that again. Thanks, Jack. [Bell ringing] Home, sweet home. [Squeaking] [Bell ringing] [Telephone ringing] (Tom) Hello, Tom Piper here. Master-- (Mary) Tom, it's Mary. Oh, yeah. I've been looking over this toy list. There's a lot here. Mmm-hmm. There won't be a Christmas, if we don't come through for Santa. We're not gonna let Santa down because I'm not gonna let you down, Mary. Mary? Whoa, Mary? Whoo-hoo. Oh, oh. You're gonna need this to, uh... How can you work in this mess? [Gasping] Don't touch anything. It's all organized. Really, Tom, you get more like papa every minute. Thanks. My goodness. It's a wonder we get anything done around here. Hmm. Tom? Hmm? What was that? Don't worry, everything's under control. Remember, it's toy time. [Jack coughing] It might be ok. Hmm, with some curtains. Come on. It stinks. It's not like I wanted a mansion. Just some place nice with someone who loves US. You know. (Jack) A family. * in my heart * there lives a dream * it stays though I may roam * * it's a dress of lace * soap to wash my face * and a comb * wish we had a home * home means lots of stuff to eat * * a yard, a dog, and me * and a tree house, you bet * * add it up you get * what I want the most * * to be a family * papa built a factory * he valued more than gold * * and it frightens me that this legacy * * that I hold * needs someone more bold * boldly I will go beyond * * what I know has been done before * * take this old factory * show what it could be * with a new toy line * that I'll design * this is what I dream * I've a dream inside of me * * it'll never die, me and my dream * * dream * that I hold so tenderly * * you must believe (Tom and Mary) * our dream is made of a secret * * you've been longing * from the start * a dream is simply a wish * * made from your heart (Jack) * wish we had (Jill) * mom and dad (both) * now, that's a family (Jill) * holidays (Jack) * in the summer times * sounds wonderful * be in charge * keep it large (both) * I can make magic * make a wish and close your eyes * * and dream * I've a dream inside of me * * it'll never die, me and my dream * * that I hold so tenderly * * you must believe * and hold to your dream * as dreamers do (Jill) * when your dream will come true * (Mary) * in my heart (Jack and Jill) * lives inside of me * I have a dream (all) * dream I wish * come true [Purring] Now that I've done away with Tom Piper and Santa's order with him, Mary will simply have to sell me the toy factory. [Chuckling] Are you listening to me? [Purring] [Screeching] I'll buy it and savor it and then destroy it. [Laughing] [Birds chirping] Beautiful day. The children would enjoy playing outside. Keep 'em in! [Mewling] [Barking] [Growling] [Burping] [Birds chirping] [Barnaby chortling] [Baby cooing] [Laughing] [Baby wailing] [Groaning] [Chuckling] *[humming] Oh, that barnaby. I'd like to clean his clock. Whoo! If I were a few years younger, and of course, not an egg... Oh! [Groaning] [Mr. Dumpty groaning] [Squeaking] [Yelling] (Mr. Dumpty) Great. I think I sprung a leak. [Caterwauling] (Jill) Nice, kitty. Pretty, kitty. Won't you let US by, so we can go to the toy factory? [Snarling] No. Get out of the way, you stinky old bag of fleas. [Growling] [Both exclaiming] Hey, I know. No! Woofy! Oh, Jack, give him back. Jack, stop it. [Snarling] [Shrieking] [Growling] Come on and get me, you chicken. Chick--chick--chicken. [Roaring] [Hissing] What's the matter? You a scaredy-cat? [Snarling] [Groaning] Run! [Snarling] [Barking] Come on. (Jack) Dumb cat. [Both laughing] (Barnaby) Oh, come, come, my dear. I am offering far more than the place is worth. Even your father could've seen that. Mr. Barnaby, the factory is not for sale. Papa built this factory. Without it, there wouldn't be any toyland. Hmm, how true. Which makes the thought of the old factory closing down, doubly distressing, doesn't it? Why would we close down? No toy orders from Santa claus. It--it's all over at toyland, that Tom Piper never returned from the north pole. I even heard the goblins had him for dinner. Oh, really? And how did I taste? Uh, just stay out of this, Piper. And since Santa's order uh, is the mainstay of your business, it-- Piper! Hey, how you doin'? Barnaby, this meeting is over. [Coins jingling] Take your money and get out. I'll take that as a no. But when I return, it won't be with an offer, but an ultimatum. Wow! (Jill) I've never seen so many beautiful toys. [Gasping] Jack! Yikes! Uncle barnaby. [Grumbling] What's he doing here? [Grunting] [Chuckling] Boy, that was close. Come on. Hurry. Before uncle barnaby sees US. Hey, Jack, Jill. Great! You guys ready for the executive tour? Come on. Whoa! Let's go! [Whooping] (All) * ding-dong, all the day long * * our factory sings this song * * we make toys for girls and boys * * our factory sings this song * * this is it, our factory * * wheels and gears * fill your ears (both) * what you hear is music * it's a fact, our factory is making toys * * for girls and boys (both) * the hum of gears * is music to our ears * pick it up, pick it up, pick a little package up * * pick it up, pick it up and go * * hurry up, hurry up, hurry up the tempo hurry up, don't be slow * * it's a symphony, this factory * * the song with a simple melody * * a rhapsody for you and me * * the song that we all can sing * (all) * ding-dong, all the day long * * our factory sings this song * * we make toys for girls and boys * * our factory sings this song * * we can really swing down in packaging * * with bows of ribbon and string * * lovely maids, charming babes * * they're the most delightful things * * all together we work in Harmony * * like a family, we would do it free * * a rhapsody for you and me * * a song that we all can sing * oh! (All) * ding-dong, all the day long * * our factory sings this song * (both) * ding-dong * ding-dong, all the day long * * with bows of ribbon and string * * lovely maids, charming babes * * hurry up, hurry up, hurry up the tempo, hurry up, don't be slow * [Tooting] [Machinery rumbling] [Clock ticking] [Whirring] [Bellowing] [Buzzing] [Sloshing] [Tinging] [Heralding] [Gears clunking] [All exclaiming] [All gasping] (All) * ding-dong, all the day long * * our factory sings this song * * oh, yes, we, we all agree * * and sing infallibly that our factory sings * * sings our song [snorting] [All chattering] Mmm-hmm. Who is that? You like it? It's, uh... Uh, it's very, uh... It's something I came up with while I was talking to Santa, and he went for the idea in a big way. (Mary) He did? Well, if he wanted a huge, gigantic, amazingly large toy soldier, he sure got one. [Clearing throat] Well, actually, he wants 1,000 of 'em. 1,000, in 2 days? Tom, that's impossible. Yeah! Well, come on, Mary, the impossible jobs are the most fun. I appreciate your enthusiasm, [sighing] But there are only so many hours in a day. Jack and I could help. There, you see? Job's gettin' easier by the minute. Now, I figured you two for toymakers. [Grumbling] Ok, first, we'll retool the big press. Little boy blue can make the horns. And puss will handle the boots. I knew you'd figure it out. We make a great team. Hey, kids, thanks for helpin'. I really like them. Just wish they got along better. Don't let their problems concern you, my dear. You have something far worse to worry about. [Banging] (Jack) Put me down, would you? [Jill shrieking] If I ever catch you near that toy factory again, it's straight to the goblin forest, where you'll be [mewing] Goblinned up. But, uncle barnaby, what have we done? Yeah, what's the matter with you? "What's the matter?" But what impudence! [Yelping] There's nothing the matter with me. I'm not the problem. I'm never the problem. It's everyone else. * I live in a land of nincompoops * * I curse them, every one * * so feverishly devoted to their laughter and their fun * * I never had fun or laughter * * and you see, I turned out fine * * that's why my little scheme is so divine * * ooh, what a crooked man is barnaby * ah, yes. * there's nobody more unscrupulous than he * oh, thank you, so much. * we agree that he's a miserable gent * * they say his very soul is bent * * each winter I'm filled with nausea, imagining... * [retching] * ...The toys * constructed in frightening quantities * * for screeching girls and boys * * this holiday they'll discover * * only the rug beneath the tree * * because I'll destroy that blasted factory! Ha! * * ooh, what a crooked man, is barnaby * [hissing affirmatively] * it's kind of as if he is morally askew * [purring affirmatively] * true affection tends to make him very ill * * for hatred is his greatest thrill * * oh, yes, I'll crush the toys to rubble * * burst their silly bubble * make this jolly land a place they long to leave * * I'll fill the streets with quicksand * * Santa's sleigh with bricks * * and I'll have myself a merry Christmas Eve * [scat shrieks] * the clock is ticking, my little factory * * your days are numbered * I'll rid them of every plaything * * oh, it thrills me to my bones * * no red rubber balls, no dainty dolls * * no tiny telephones * if I did without such rubbish * * why shouldn't everyone, n'est-ce pas? * * we'll live in a toyless world at last, hurrah! * * hit it, boys * ooh, what a crooked man is barnaby * * indescribably (candles) * there's no point of view more venomous than his * * you're so quick to notice * * 'tis no lie that he's a truly nasty guy * * he never had a toy, that's why * [crashing] * ooh, what a crooked man is barnaby * * undeniably * there's nothing as warped as his philosophy * * not even remotely close * we can gravely see why he's his only fan * * what a slimeball! [Coughing] * that barnaby is * a crooked man [Knocking at door] [Footsteps approaching] Go away, go away. Good evening, captain, sir. I am Rodrigo, and this me mate, gonzargo. I'm the big one. We're answerin' your ad. Ad? What ad? [Metallic clanking] [Growling] (Gonzargo) Sorry. "Single crooked male, 50-ish, cruel, scheming, "seeks 2 vicious cutthroats. Object: Robbery, sabotage, villainy--" oh, yes. [Giggling nervously] (Barnaby) Well, you do seem rather vicious, in a malodorous sort of way. (Gonzargo) There you go. Thank you, captain, sir. [Squeaking] For whom have you worked? Ah, black eye, the pirate, give me this here hook. Actually, it was more like a trade. He--he got my hand. So, what do you want US to do, captain? What, you wanted the larceny? Oh, I'm good at that. Gonzargo. You--you wanted the theft? Oh, I'm sneaky, I'm really sneaky. You wanna-- you wanna fillet a particular person's gizzard? Oh, that's my favorite! The gizzard's my favorite. [Smacking] Shut up your mouth! Yes, i--i think I may be able to use you, after all. [Grumbling] (Jack) That should do it. It's pretty high. Come on, it's easy. (Jill) I hope uncle barnaby doesn't hear US. [Growling] [Jill shrieking] [Both screaming] [Laughing menacingly] [Blowing a raspberry] [Grunting] [Jack laughing] Hope we're not late. Tom and Mary are gonna need all the help they can get. [Whirring] [Beeping] [Whirring] [Bleating] [Rodrigo grumbling] Mary, well, what do you think about, uh, Tom? Tom who? You know. I think he's a goofball genius who doesn't take anything seriously, who has bad taste in hats. (Jill) Mmm-hmm. Mr. Dumpty said you liked him. [Jill giggling] [Both exclaiming] [Rodrigo muttering] This should do it. Yeah. [Both chattering] [Monkey wrench screaming] [Gears grinding] [Machines hissing] [All chattering] [Oinking] [All exclaiming] What? [Screaming] Shh! [Both bleating] What is it? Ok, let's take a look down-- hey! There's a monkey wrench jammed down here. [Pressure Gauge whistling] [Grunting] Can't reach it. (Jack) I can do it. What? We have to take the whole machine apart. But the deadline. I'm little. I can get in there. Hey, you're right. Let me give you a hand. (Mary) Jack, Jack, come on, Jack. (Boy) You can do it! Ok, Jack, now you be careful. [Groaning] (Tom) It's down there. Can you see it? Come on. [Hissing] Hurry up, Jack. I don't know how long I can hold you. (Jack) A little bit further. [Gasping] Oh! (Mary) Tom, the machine! It's-- it's about ready to blow! Hurry, Jack! (Tom) Jack! [Alarm buzzing] [Groaning] [Rumbling] (Mary) Hurry! Hurry! Got it! [Machine whistling] [All cheering] (Girl) 3 cheers for Jack! (Tom) Congratulations to the new chief executive toymaker! (Girl) 3 cheers for Jack! [Machines whirring] [Siren wailing] All right, everybody, it's toy time. What do you think? [Rodrigo and gonzargo bleating] (Jill) I think those sheep put that wrench in there. And I'm gonna tell Tom. We can catch 'em. They're just sheep. Hey, you sheep! Stop! [Both screaming] The police! *[humming] Oh! Hmm. Whoa. [Chuckling] [Humming] [Exclaiming] (Jack) There they are, over there! Hey! Wait! (Jack and Jill) Stop! [Bleating] [Gonzargo bleating] [Both exclaiming] (Rodrigo) That ain't the police! That's nothing but a couple of kids. Well, rod, it could be a disguise, you know? I mean, we ain't really sheep. [Groaning] [Snarling] [Gonzargo yelling] [Grunting] [Rodrigo screaming] [Splashing] Wait! Woofy. (Gonzargo) Nope. [Chuckling diabolically] [Grunting] [Gonzargo screaming] Oh, not again. [Jill shrieking] (Both) Uncle barnaby! What did I tell you about leaving the attic? [Rodrigo and gonzargo chattering angrily] Why aren't you at the factory? Did you do the job? Oh, yes, sir. Yes, captain, sir. Oh, we done-- we done a good bit of sabotage. (Gonzargo) Then these two spoiled it. I'm gonna tell Tom about you. Children should be seen and not heard. Better yet, never seen or heard from again. Can--can we fillet their gizzards? No. Take them to the goblin forest. [Both gasping] Ok, captain, sir. Y-You think those goblins'll eat US? With 2 plump, juicy children around, why should they bother with a couple of gristly mouthfuls like you? (Both) Yeah. G-G-Good thinking, captain, sir. Yeah. All right. Come on, you. Move it along, little goblin chow. *[humming] Ow! [Creaking] Huh? (Mr. Dumpty) Oh! Oh. Oh, my gosh! The kids. They're taking them to the goblin forest. I've gotta tell Mary and Thomas. [Mr. Dumpty screaming] [Groaning] I think we're actually gonna finish in time. It might mean we work all night. You with me? Nothing could drag me away. [Mr. Dumpty screaming] Alert! Emergency! It's-- it's Jack and Jill! * it didn't take long for the downfall * * of poor little Jack and Jill * * now, isn't it sad, gonzargo? * * too bad about that hill! Ha ha! * * we're off to the goblin forest * * and I'm glad you're looking glum * * 'cause, oh, oh, oh, oh, the worst is yet to come * (both) * oh, oh, oh, oh, the worst is yet to come * ah, these kids don't look so good around the gills. * the forest is crawling with goblins * * they're deadly, they're quick * * they're tough * they're passion is mass destruction * * I think they breathe fire and stuff * (Rodrigo) * they chew up unlucky children * * like so many pieces of gum * (both) * oh, oh, oh, oh, the worst is yet to come * * oh, oh, oh, oh, the worst is yet to come * you couldn't take US to such an awful place. I could, too. Couldn't I, rod? I'll bet you're both phonies. And this is your first job. Shut up your mouth! Tell them, gonz. * on the isle of iggadig * a pirate captain paid US big * [giggling] * to finish off * a serpent from the sea * with 80 hands * once the town of jelly roll * * was bothered by a dusty troll * (both) * we bashed his face in * for a handsome fee * gee ain't that a lovely * * memory oh, how I love to reflect. [Screaming] * you be very afraid, little kiddies * * you babes, be filled with gloom * (Rodrigo) * no dollies or dancing flatware * * in the forest of your doom * (both) * you'll wish you were back at the attic * * in the dark without a crumb * * oh, oh, oh, oh, the worst is yet to come * * oh, oh, oh, oh, the worst is yet to come * (Jill) Woofy! * your nerves are jarred, your heart beats hard * * like a kettle drum * you're hearing shrieks and eerie squeaks * * where is that one coming from? * * it's worse than we imagined * * gonzargo, stop sucking your thumb * * oh, oh, oh, oh, the worst is yet to come * * oh * oh * oh (Both) Aah! The worst is yet to come. [Laughing] [Screaming] [Screaming] [Growling] (Jack) Hey. No, no, no, no, please. Not woofy. Please! [Jill sobbing] Please, no! [Creatures screeching] (Tom) Gosh! I hope we're not too late. [Jill shrieking] Jill! Come on, Tom. Ah, Mr. Dumpty. Working the night shift? Barnaby! Why aren't you out there looking for Jack and Jill? Oh, are they missing? Oh, you're not crooked. You're twisted. [Chuckling] Oh, thank you so much. Uh, Mr. Dumpty, I'll have that key. [Grunting] Oh! Oh, no. Woofy! [Sobbing] Jill, come on. We'll get out of this. Promise. No, we won't. We're all alone. [Slobbering] Mmm. Tasty. [Both moaning in fear] Don't eat US, please. No. No. Mr. Goblin king, we take you to the toyland. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. You eat everybody there. It's, uh, very good. Isn't it good? Oh, yum, yum. Yum, yum, yum. Yeah, yeah. You'll take US to the toyland gates, hmm? We can do that. Yeah. You gonna like them. Yeah. It's very nice, very... Nice and sweet. Yeah, sweet! Not like US. You live there, hmm? No, just passin' through. Yeah, yeah. No good. You must live there. That's the rule. [Roaring] You live there, yes? You will take US. Back off, you wart-faced, slimy lizard! [Roaring] (Tom) He said back off! [Tom yelling] [Grunting] Ah! Kids, run! [Tom grunting] Why don't you pick on someone your own size? [Groaning] [Groaning] Kids, run! Run! This way! Hurry! Jill, are you ok? [Roaring] [Screaming] No! No! Lights, no! [Gasps] [Goblins screaming] [Screaming] (Tom) Mary. Ok. [All chattering] (Tom) Hurry, kids. Come on. (Jill) Hurry up. [Both groaning] Give me the key, you cholesterol-laden buffoon! No, no, let go! Dumpty, do you ever ponder the fragility of an egg? Now cut that out! Imagine what might happen if you were to find yourself, oh, let's say, atop a high wall? Ow. You could have a great fall. And all the kings horses ah. And all the kings men stop! Could never put humpty dumpty together again! [Moaning] Please, barnaby. [Screaming] [Splattering] [Exclaiming] [Laughing] Oh, scat. He's all broken up. That makes two of US. (Mary) Stay out of my factory, barnaby. [Gasping] We know all about your little plan. I--I'm sorry, captain, sir, I think we spilled the bean.
