Darling David, where have you been all my life? Where have you been, where have you been? Where have you been? The only thing I needed was this man. Oh, Edie! - What? What did you say, Edie? All I needed was this man... David. No, she was gorgeous. Edie had everything. She doesn't remember what she was. Everybody looks and thinks and feels differently as the years go by. Edie, look. Your wedding jewels, Mother darling. Yes. Here... do me up, chicken. This might be the last time I wear these. Why? Why? Because next time this will be dangling from your neck, not mine. And these... these will grace the ears of Mrs. J. Paul Getty. Mother. "Mrs. J. Paul Getty." That has a lovely ring to it. Or Mrs. Jordan McClanahan. Now I hear he has his eye on you. He's bound to propose after tonight. You look absolutely gorgeous. The doctor was right about your hair growing back. No one will notice. He also said that it could all fall out again at any moment, so I have that to look forward to, haven't I? It'll be fine. Now don't be long. Sir. - Edith, you look divine. Where's little Edie? Isn't she ready yet? - She needs a minute. It's been over an hour, darling. Well, you know Edie. Always the queen of the dramatic pause. I suppose I could entertain our guests with a little song while we wait. I prefer they don't leave before Edie has been presented, but thank you, Edith. Ah. There's our girl. Miss Beale, they're ready for you. Edie! Edie. Come on back in. I can't. Edith, you'll never get a man to propose to you if you don't have a debut. And if you can't get a man to propose to you, well, you just... - "You might as well be dead"? If you don't get married, how on earth do you plan to take care of yourself? You know I want to be an actress and a dancer. Once you married Father, he made you give up your singing. I won't let that happen to me. I still sing, and I have a perfectly marvelous marriage. When are you going to learn, Edie? You can have your cake and eat it too in this life. No, you can't, Mother darling. Edie, find a man who'll give you a long leash, get married and then you can do whatever you want. Come on. How about Mrs. Howard Hughes? Too greasy. You're absolutely right. Edie? Oh, Edie! Have you fed Buster? Yes, Mother, I fed him his luncheon. Oh, there's a horrible smell. I can hardly stand it. Oh, will you shut up? It's a goddamn beautiful day. Just shut up! Well, look what the cat dragged in! It's the Maysles. - Hello, Edie. I was just thinking about you. What brings you out to Grey Gardens? We'd like to do a movie just about you and your mother. Yeah. - Really? What about the Bouvier movie? Well, Jackie's probably too busy being Mrs. Aristotle Onassis, huh? Your cousin Lee sort of lost interest in that and... pulled the plug. Oh, Al, that's terrible. You and your mother were the best part of it, to be perfectly honest. Mother and I are very entertaining, that's true. So this movie would just be starring me and Mother, no one else? - That's the idea. Well, then it looks like the Beales just stole the Bouvier movie. This is great. This is going to be my big chance... my chance to relaunch my career. Edie! The Maysles are back to make a movie about us, Mother darling. Do you think your mother will go along with it? It's her house and she has in it who she wants in it. You understand. Oh my heart, how perfectly flattering. Hello, Mrs. Beale. An old woman like me, no. I'm not much of an actress you know. So, boys, now explain to me: Exactly how would this work? Is there a script? I'm a very quick study. Are you the director then, David? Well, no script. No director. It's a documentary. You just do what you do, and we just stay in the background. Just artists making a film about artists. We've always been mad about the movies... "Gigi" with Leslie Caron. Oh, marvelous. Did you ever see that? Of course. - Yeah. It all sounds terribly exciting. And I assume we'll share in the profits. To be honest, the words "documentary" and "profit" don't usually end up in the same sentence. There's never been one about us. I'm certain that we can work something out. We'll work something out. - Yeah. And I'll need a clause in my contract that lets me do roles in other movies. Well, sure. - Absolutely. I don't think that's... - That's not a problem. Then that cements the deal. They're here already. - Oh, my goodness. Buddy, Phelan. Last one in is a rotten egg. Boys, no running in the house. Good morning, Mr. Beale. Hello, Robert. - Hello, hello. Molly! We didn't expect you till later this afternoon. Oh, it's all right, Molly. It's okay. Hello. - I just couldn't wait. Go on. Edith. Now this is far too extravagant. What you've got here is a veritable army of... we're in the midst of a depression, Edie. I've already had to let half my staff go and... you're going to have to cut back as well. It takes many many hands to run this house properly, Phelan. You can keep Molly and Frank but the rest have to be dismissed. What about Gould? - What about him? You can't deprive the children of their music lessons. That would be cruel. Fine. Molly, Frank and Gould, but that's it. Now as far as Edie is concerned... please, get her engaged to a... stable person. Though I'm not sure either one of you would know stable if it walked through your soup. Well, whatever do you mean? You know exactly what I mean, Edith. She's unpredictable. That stunt at the Pierre did not go unnoticed. Oh, Phelan, please. She's high-spirited. Well, whatever euphemism you've got for it... get her settled in with a good family. This is your job, your sole responsibility. What, you're leaving already? I have to work, Edith. Someone has to pay for the Maidstone Club and all those goddamn crab sandwiches. And someone has to tend to his secretary. Gould, you're here. Edith, darling. Oh, you look divine. Oh, so do you. Are you in voice? I haven't practiced in ages. That's why I'm here, hmm? Well, then I'm off. Children, say goodbye to your father. He's suddenly been called back to the city. Already? I'll see you on the weekend. Goodbye, Buddy. Bye, little man. - Goodbye, Father. Can I come with you? Please. It's the summer, Edie. There's no one your age in town. But there's a dance class I'd like to attend. Just find yourself a nice fellow from the Maidstone Club. That's all you have to focus on this summer. Oh, Father, but they're just so dull. Edie... enough. That's a Spanish wall garden over there. The Hills, they put that in. They imported everything from Rome. Mrs. Hill, she was a famous, uh, horticulturist. That was one of the famous gardens of America. Edie, you look fantastic. David, you look absolutely terrific. Honestly. You've got light blue on. Well, Al, you're still, um... Mother says you're very conservative. This is the best thing to wear for today, you understand, because I don't like women in skirts. And the best thing is to wear pantyhose or some pants under a short skirt, I think. Then you have the pants under the skirt. And then you can pull the stockings up over the pants, underneath the skirt. And you can always take off the skirt and use it as a cape, so I think this is the best costume for the day. Okay. I have to think these things up, you know? Mother wanted me to come out in a kimono, so we had a quite a fight. Al, was that good? You want me to do that again? What a body, Beale. "Smart and sleek, she sits, Ready with her playful quips, Wondering who will come her way To dine her, to wine her, Which to snare to stay." William Blake. Edith Beale... poet, temptress, entertainer. That was great, cousin Edie. Ah. It's in the Bouvier blood. You can do it, too, Jacqueline. Mr. Strong. The children are all at the beach. Shall we have our lesson? Of course, darling. Let's. How about this one? Aren't they just divine? - Divine. Brava. Should I tell them about Gould? Gould was mother's accompanist. He was a boogie-woogie composer with the most terrific style. He was the most brilliant man I ever met... that's including Mr. Beale and Mr. Bouvier. Completely brilliant. I came down here to live in this... this house... because I did all my singing here. I was so happy. I was happier singing... than anything I've ever done since I was born. I liked it better... than anything I ever did. Come on, Edie, soft-shoe. How can you resist? Whoo! Mr. Beale. Edith! Mr. Beale, what are you doing here? It's only Thursday. It's Friday, Edith. - Oh. Get everyone out of here... including him... goddamn Ganymede. I'm right here, Phelan. I can hear you. All right, everyone, time to go home. Time to go home. Au revoir. You get away from that door. Go. Go. - Come on, Edie. It used to be charming, Edith. Now it's just sad. And what's that, Phelan? You're the mother of my children, not a showgirl. And mothers can't sing? You know what I mean. Edie. Enough is enough. I'm making a change. I'm putting the boys in boarding school and I'm bringing little Edie back to the city before you ruin her altogether. Oh! Ruin her. Why, because she was dancing at a party? The priest said she needs a strong hand. I'm sick and tired of this conversation over and over. And where are you in all this, Mr. Father of my children? I don't need this. Well, neither do I. Then you'll live your life... and I'll live mine. With pleasure. Mother. Mother, please. Aren't you going to say goodbye? Why? Where are you going? I'm going to New York, Mother. Why, that's just crazy. What are you going to do in New York? I'm going to be an actress and a dancer. And of course your father is going to make all the introductions. Is that it? Set you up? With all his show business connections at the law firm? I worry about you, babe. Stay here. I'm strong. You've always said that I was a staunch character, remember? Stop that. - Cut it out! I want your blessing, Mother, please. Edith. Edie, Edie. There's nothing there that you can't get here. You can travel the whole world and you'll still never find anything as beautiful as right here. Besides... Gould doesn't know how to soft-shoe. Who am I going to dance with? Goodbye, Mother. Edie! Oh, Edie! She never answers me, that women. I suppose I won't get out of here until she dies or I die. Who's "she," the cat? I don't know when I'm going to get out of here. Why do you want to get out? Because I like freedom. Well, you can't get it, darling. You're being... supported. You can't get freedom when you're being supported. I thought you always said you can't get freedom when you're not being supported, remember? It's awful both ways, I guess. I'd just like a couple of days on the beach. That's all. Everything is good you didn't do. At the time you didn't want it. Everybody looks and thinks and feels differently as the years go by. It's very difficult to keep the line between the past and the present. Awfully difficult. Hello, Father. Sorry I'm late. I've ordered for you. So... Yes? ...isn't this the part where you ask me if I've met someone new? Well, have you? I meet new people all the time. That's not what I meant and you know it. I can't afford to support you indefinitely, Edie. Who do you think pays for women like you? Men like me. - "Men like me." Between your room at the Barbizon and your allowance, your mother's allowance... Your new fake wife's allowance. Don't be insolent. Do you want this check or not? And that position is still open at the law firm. You're a smart girl, Edie. And you're more than capable of secretarial work. I don't know why you can't hold one of these jobs. Just promise me you'll try to get back on course. Yes, Father. At least you've given up that foolish notion of performing your mother infected you with. Oh, yes, absolutely. Who is that guy at the third table? The name's Julius Krug. The Secretary of the Interior? No idea. Watch out, he's married. Heavens! It's Max Gordon. Who's that? You don't know who Max Gordon is? He's a famous producer. Max Gordon discovered Judy Holliday and is generally considered the king of Broadway. It is a beautiful ocean today, isn't it? What color would you say it was? Blue. You're absolutely right. Sapphire. Oh, this is the most beautiful place on earth. I don't know how anyone could prefer New York City. I'm terribly sorry to interrupt your luncheon, but I know we haven't been properly introduced. I'm Edith Bouvier Beale and you're Max Gordon. Thank you. I'd had a few of these and I started to wonder. I hear you're on the lookout for the next great actress. I am casting a new musical this summer. I just adore musicals and I do terrific dances. I was doing the V.M.I. Marching song, which is a ground maneuver, and when I do that, see, that's when the plane goes by. You're quite the comedienne. You're funnier than Judy Holliday. We're holding auditions at the Guild Theater at the end of July. Ring my office, put yourself on the list for a shot. Well, I'll try to squeeze it in. Thank you, Mr. Gordon. Thank you very much. Thank you. Cute gal. Miss Beale. - Yeah? That was quite the little routine you put on in there. Why, thank you, Mr... Krug. Please call me Cap. Everybody does. Cap, that's marvelous. I was named after my mother. She's also Edith. Would you have dinner with me, Edith? Lunch? Dessert? You could take me dancing. Come on, Pinky. $658.48 to the Maidstone Club. Edith, let's just cancel it. No, when Edie comes home she'll want to go. Edith, she's not coming home. - Don't say that. I'll pay for it out of the Bouvier trust. Next. Here's one from P.C. Shank & Sons for $89.27 for the heating oil. Send that one to my husband. I already did last month. Your husband's wife sent it back. I am not in the mood for this, Gould. Not now. We'll finish later. Gould. Yes, Edith. You know I'd be lost without you. And I you, darling. Like a moth to the flame. And what's a moth without a flame? Dancing isn't exactly my forte. You're doing just fine. So what's he like? Who? - President Truman. He and I didn't see eye to eye on certain things so I... stepped down from his cabinet. Oh, I just adore politics. How is it you haven't been snapped up up by some eligible bachelor yet, Edith? Oh, I've sworn off bachelors. What do you have against bachelors? They're boring, inconsiderate, pigheaded, stubborn, spoiled mama's boys who think they have a premium on women, which unfortunately they have, there being so many of us girls around. Hang on. But one has got to make the most in a difficult situation, and that's why women in desperation have turned to the married man. Married men are generous and discreet, they don't make a fuss, they don't stick around and they let you have a career if you want one. Most girls would be jealous. Most girls aren't Edith Beale. All I want in life, Mr. Krug, is a dance partner. Goodbye, Edith. Shh! Oh my gosh, you're like a bull in a china shop. Do you want to get caught? - I'm sorry. Oh, God, if they find you here I'll be out on the streets, no questions asked. What's that? Oh, Cap, it's divine. But it's far too generous. - It suits you. So you've bought me now, is that it? Of course not, Eade. I just love to see you shine. It's exciting. - Oh, don't. I ate too much. I have to lose weight before the audition. Aw, my angel, Cap. Who ever said you can't have it all? It wasn't Edith Beale. Hello, Mother. Yeah. - Edie. What was that? I just knocked over a glass. Have you replied to Mrs. Cabot's party invitation yet? No... I mean yes. I sent my regrets. I don't want to travel all the way out to East Hampton for just one party. Well, it wouldn't be just for that, I hope. I miss you, chicken. - I miss you too, Mother, but I really must go. It's just that I'm pressing my blouse and it's going to burn. It's a bit late to go out now. Oh no, Mother. It's burning. Edie? - Tomorrow. Tomorrow. We'll talk again tomorrow. No. Edie? I love you too, Edie. Can you believe he said I was funnier than Judy Holliday? And prettier. - He didn't say that. Well... he should have. I flirt, but it's all talk. Mostly. I wish I'd met you before. Oh, Cap. She knows that I'm here. Indeed. Yes, Mother? - Listen, babe, I was thinking... were you running? No, I just got out of the tub and ran to the phone. Have you got a man there, Edie? No, of course not. But so what if I had? Why don't you bring him home? I'd like to meet this nice young man. No, stop pressuring me to come home. I'm getting work. And I'm just about to get an audition with... are you sitting down? Max Gordon. The Max Gordon. I danced for him, he went to pieces. He's married. Well, I don't know if he's married, but what does that matter? Mr. Gordon is a very prominent producer. Oh, no no no no no, Edie. I don't mean him. I mean your visitor. He's married, isn't he? - Mother. No, Edie, married men will only break your heart. I'm fine. I'm happier than I've ever been. You know that stress makes your hair fall out. Remember? - Mother, I've got to go. Ooh, I think she's onto us! Phelan? - Yes. It's me. I have some news. Is this about the check? Because... No no no, it's not about the bills. It's about your daughter. Miss Beale? Your father's here. He's waiting downstairs for you in the lobby. My God, we fell asleep. - Oh God. Here. Do you remember this? - May I see that please? The villain of the piece. "To my best friend and most delightful comrade, to my only sweetheart and wonderful wife, I tender this likeness of her husband, Phelan Beale, 1929." Did I laugh when I read that. Aren't kids terrible? I just roared. I lived alone at least 30 years. I didn't mind. You get to be very independent when you live alone. You get to be a real individual. You can't have your cake and eat it too in life. Oh, yes, I did. I did. I had my cake, loved it, masticated it, chewed it. I had everything I wanted. She was bored. She couldn't stand it. No, I was not. I was a great singer. I had a perfect marriage, beautiful children. I had a terribly successful marriage. No, I never had a fight in my life. I never threw anything at Mr. Beale, never. No, I... I never... never had words with... with Mr. Beale at all. Edie, why don't you show the Maysles the beach? Do you boys want to see the ocean? Sure. - Come on. Tickets please. Edie, this will be better for you... you can swim, fresh air. It's too hot in town. You love the ocean. Edie, please. Edie! Please say goodbye. Good evening. Grey Gardens. I'll have a look to see if Mrs. Beale is at home. Thank you, Molly. I've got it. This is Mrs. Beale. May I speak with Edith, please? To whom am I speaking? Julius Krug. - Oh. A Mr. Julius Krug for you, dear. Cap? What happened to you? I'm stuck here at my mother's house. Are you all right? I'm fine. - Okay. When are you going to be back? Well, that's just it... I don't know. I have my audition on Tuesday morning. I just have to make it back by then. I'll take you to lunch afterwards to celebrate. Meet me at the Hampshire House. Cap. Yes, Edie? - I I... um... I know. Me too. - Cap. Never say that right after I say that, okay? I never want to wonder if you thought you had to say it. But I didn't say it. Right. I'll see you there. Good night. - Goodbye. He sounded awfully married to me. Edie! Edie, come here. What's wrong, Mother? Where've you been, woman? - Paris, Mother. Look. Kitties. Little baby kitties. Marvelous. Here. Look at this one. And this one. - Poor old Pink. She must be starving. Pinky, are you hungry? We're out of cat food. I'll go into town, get some more. Oh, Edie! Edie! Get some ice cream. We'll celebrate. Yes, Mother darling. Give that to Mr. Krug, right away. Oh, and your name, miss? Judy Holliday. - Of course. Cap. Are you trying to sabotage my marriage? What do you mean? My wife loved your poem, Edith. I didn't know she was here. Please, save the innocent surprise routine for Max Gordon. I told you to meet me at the Hampshire House tomorrow. It was a mistake. Look, I can't do this anymore... at all. Cap, what we have between us is special. What we had between us... was sex. I'm sorry. Goodbye, Edie. Edie? - Mother? Oh, Edie, Edie, where are you? I'm in New York, Mother. I was apoplectic. I looked up my beau. He... Oh, Edie. Edie, he left you? Come home, Edie. But I have my audition tomorrow. Well, you're in no condition for that. No, there'll be another chance. But, Mother, it's Max Gordon. Oh, Edie. Max Gordon will wait for talent. Come home and recuperate. Let me take care of you. Edie? Edie, come home. Come home. Come home, Edie. Edie? Is that you? Did you bring the cat food? And the ice cream? It melted. - Oh. Just look at that face. Huh. These are some of the most beautiful kitties in the world. I could just elope with these kitties, put them in a big basket and elope with them. Aren't they gorgeous? Look. Edie? Let's breed cats, Edie. Wouldn't that be fun? Yeah. You get some rest, babe. Isn't this a treat? I haven't been out to the beach in absolutely forever. The only reason Mother is letting me out is because of you two fellas. I think my days at Grey Gardens are limited. I don't want to be here. I can't stand a country house in the first place. It makes me terribly nervous. Scared to death of doors, locks, people roaming around in the background under the trees and in the bushes. I'm absolutely terrified. I'm not a bit terrified in the city. Not a bit. Any little rat's nest in New York, any little mousehole, any little rathole even on 10th Avenue I would like better. Good afternoon, Grey Gardens. Oh, ho ho! Oh no, Buddy, it's me. How are you? Oh, my boy, I was just thinking of you. Oh. Come in. Buddy called. Your father has died. The funeral's here in town on Tuesday. I never said goodbye. His wife got all of it, Buddy? Every cent? Most of it, yes. What little Father did leave you was put into a trust. What's that supposed to mean? That I'm not responsible enough to manage it myself? Who oversees this trust? Buddy and I are the trustees. Then you can contest the will. There's not that much there, Mother. And frankly, lawyer's fees would just eat it all up. But don't worry, you and Edie will continue to receive your monthly stipend. That barely covers the groceries and the long-distance bill. He's had me living on $150 a month... for the last 10 years. If we increase your allowance, your money will just run out that much sooner. Which is why Buddy and I have found a nice place in Marco Island that you could afford if you were to sell Grey Gardens. I'd love to move to a hot little island. Someone's finally singing my song. No more horrid winters. And there wouldn't be nearly the upkeep this place requires. What do you say? It would be good for your back, Mother darling. Your arthritis isn't getting any better. You could get a place all on one level... no stairs to climb. I could work on my nightclub routine. You could even afford to hire some help, Mother. We've worked it all out. Maybe travel or meet somebody. Oh. Ha! I'm not selling Grey Gardens, chickens. Are you sure you don't want to spend the night here? It's such a long drive back to Glen Cove. You're not understanding. Your trust won't last forever and we can't afford to fix this place up for you. All you have to do is sign this power-of-attorney form. We'll take care of everything. Grey Gardens is in my name. It always has been. That's not going to change. The only way I'm ever leaving Grey Gardens is feet first. Eventually you'll be forced to leave. Edie? Oh, no! Oh, Edie, Edie, Edie, stop! Put that down. Oh my God. No. No no. Oh, baby. No! No! Oh no. Oh, Edie. Oh, my baby. Shh. You've got to go on. Chicken, you've got to go on in life... even when you've lost your song. Come on. Come on. Come on, sweetheart. Oh, just think of the... hat opportunities this presents, babe. What did you think when Edie came back from the Barbizon? Oh, I had to build her up. She was very sick. And I was happy to do it. She was sick? - Oh... yeah. Very delicate and very ill. She was very delicate, very bad. I don't like delicate women. I hate them. They can't have babies. They can't do anything. But I didn't know I came back to give Gould a vacation. Yes, he wanted a vacation. But I didn't know that. Now listen. You're wasting... you're wasting that thing on this, because this is just nuts. How long am I going to be on display? I'm not in the mood anymore. You're doing great, Mrs. Beale. I suppose Mother didn't want me to have anybody that was decent. You understand. Under brilliant sunshine, a steady stream of some 200 world statesmen follow a black-veiled Jacqueline Kennedy as she walks in silent dignity behind the coffin of her slain husband. A hushed silence has fallen across the thousands of bystanders who line the route of the funeral procession as they catch their first glimpse of President Kennedy's children, little Caroline and John, dressed in their best coats, holding their mother's hands and surrounded by a sea of black. John John's third birthday is today. It is 12:00 here in Washington as Mrs. Kennedy leads her children up the cathedral steps and into the west door of St. Matthew's for the service. Of course I'm mad about animals, but raccoons and cats become a little bit boring. I mean for too long a time... I don't know. I don't know. I'd better check on Mother and the cats. She's a lot of fun. I hope she doesn't die. I'd hate to spend another winter here, though. Oh God, another winter. This is private property you know. You shouldn't be here. Miss Beale, I'm the head of the housing and sanitation division of the Suffolk County Health Department, and this is my deputy. How you do, Miss Beale? We've received several complaints. From whom? Mostly from people downwind of you. The community's concerned with the state of your property, starting with this automobile in the yard here. Look, things just tend to accumulate after Labor Day, what can I tell you? Right. We also understand that you may have no heat, no running water, and your home is no longer fit for human or even animal habitation. Who put you up to this? Was it my rotten brothers? We need to inspect your home for possible health-code violations. Have you got a search warrant? Uh, well, no. My mother and I appreciate your concern, but you really shouldn't have come. If this place isn't thoroughly cleaned up, we'll have no choice but to take legal action to force you and your mother to vacate. What do you mean the trust has run out? Completely? Oh, Buddy, how? No, no Florida! We have been clients of P.C. Shank & Sons for over 50 years. Does that not count for anything at all? Huh? Well, yes. But when you have a reversal of fortune, sir, what do you hope will happen to you? Hello? Hello? Edie, call the grocer. I'm starving. Mother, they've cut us off. Can you get the heating guy back? It's getting cold. He won't come. We owe him $947. Go to bed with him if you have to. Winter's just around the corner. Everyone just hold here, okay? Miss Beale. Miss Beale, we're back and we need to speak to you. It's the authorities. I'll be down just as soon as I put on some lipstick. Just stay here, I'll take care of everything. Edie, don't let them in. - Hello. What? - Here's the inspection warrant you were asking for, Miss Beale. "Diseased cats." We're not harboring any diseased cats. That's what we're here to determine. Excuse me, ma'am. - Wait! No! Oh, Jesus. - You can't go in there! A couple of you check there. Don't go up there! Oh my God. - Get out of this house! Get out of my mother's house! - Edie! Someone get a cage, please. Watch your step through here. My gosh. Edie. Get out of our home. I can't stand this mean, nasty Republican town. I mean, where else but in East Hampton do you have to pay to get your garbage taken away? There's someone out there. There's no one out there. It's all in your head, kid. I think he has a camera. You need to get dressed, Mother darling. You don't want the whole world to see you looking like that. What do you mean the whole world? There's no one here but us chickens. I think your staunch daughter just came up with the solution to our vexing situation. You're not going to get a very good picture from all the way back here. I'm sorry, I was... please don't call the police. The police? Mother thought we should invite you in for tea. Oh, you want me to stand here? Yeah, right there. Are you taking pictures of me? Yes, Mrs. Beale. Did you photograph the carved banister and panel doors? Only a student of architecture could fully appreciate details like that. You're going to publish these photographs, right? They'll definitely be published. Great. Who is it? Who's there? Aunt Edie, it's Jacqueline. Jacqueline, I was just thinking about you. We'll be right down. Oh, Jacqueline. We weren't expecting you. Sorry to have come over unannounced, but your phone's been disconnected. - Oh. Hmm. That-that-that cat is going to the bathroom right on the back of your portrait, Aunt Edith. Edie's a little, uh, not much of a... cleaner. She doesn't like to polish and do things like that. Why don't we all go sit out in the walled garden? It's such a beautiful day. You've always had such a gorgeous hair. It's wonderful to see you, dear. What brings you to East Hampton, Jacqueline? I needed to get away, so I decided to stay with Lee in Montauk for a few days. Oh, Lee's in Montauk? - Mm-hmm. I've got a niece in Montauk and I didn't know. She's staying at Andy Warhol's place. My sister's fallen in with a bit of a film crowd. She's got her mind set on making a movie about our childhoods out here in East Hampton. Well, if your ever need a place to stay, chicken, if you need to get away from it all, the door's always open. Oh God, these chairs. Are they dirty, these chairs? We can sit on paper. Huh. Jacqueline, did you... huh. Did you receive our condolences after that... that terrible thing with Jack? Oh, I meant to thank you. I'm sorry. You've had quite a rough go of it, haven't you? I don't think I was ever really cut out for public life, such scrutiny. No judgments here, Jacqueline. Thank you, Aunt Edie. You two have always been so warm to me. Edie, are you all right? Is it true that Jack Kennedy gave you gonorrhea? Edie! I'm terribly sorry, Jacqueline. Do you remember Jack's brother, Joe Kennedy Jr? No, Edie, he died in the war years before I even met Jack. When he died I cried, I really did. Joe was an extraordinarily beautiful young man. I was really taken by him. Yes, too bad he wasn't taken by you. He certainly was. It's no secret they were grooming him to be president before they ever started looking to Jack. He was a superb dancer. He really was. It was his manners I remember most, though. You know what I'll always remember? Summers here in East Hampton, with Aunt Edie singing and you taking me down to the beach. I was the golden girl. You certainly were. Edie, get us some pate, won't you? You know, if Joe hadn't gone down in the war, then I certainly would have married him and then I... Edie, don't! Just get us some pate or ice cream or something. I'd have become First Lady and not you. Yes, Jacqueline. It could have been me. I wish it had been you, Edie. I really do. Grey Gardens. I hardly recognize it. Buddy said you won't let them sell it. They are lovely boys, but they don't understand. I don't think I do either. Grey Gardens... is my home. It's the only place where I feel completely myself. You have extraordinary determination, Aunt Edie. You don't have to worry. Ari and I are going to help you get things all straightened out. Lee can supervise everything since she's so close by. I had no idea, really. Oh dear, no. I could never ask you to do something like that. You didn't. I'm offering. Insisting, in fact. "It should've been me." You never dated Joe Kennedy. What a whopper! I met him at a house party at Princeton. Exactly, you met him, but you weren't going to marry him. That's clear. Well, I might have, Mother darling. I might have. You want to take my picture? This has all been very very hard on me. Take it right here. This is the original porch of the house. The threat of eviction, presumably over. 60-year-old English ivy! What's going on? Edie! - That would be good. Oh, Edie! - What? What? Don't let them take anything out of my house. What's in that bag? Edie, what's he going to do with that rug? Lee, what's going on? - What's he taking out? This is Albert and David Maysles. David and Al, very nice to meet you. A movie with Lee and Jackie? Oh. Come on, let's go inside for a second. There's nothing wrong with that rug. Hey, do we have any more of those? Yeah. If Edie were any good, if she were any good at all... this is all soft-shoe now, you know? This is a dance. Come on, Edie. I use to do it myself, you know. I did that... soft-shoe. Dance to that, Edie. It's a waltz. Come on. Get Edie up. Dance the waltz. How can you resist it? How can you resist that? Isn't that a beautiful chord? Darling David, where have you been all my life? Where have you been? Where have you been? Where have you been? The only thing I needed was this man. Oh, Edie. - What? What did you say, Edie? All I needed was this man... David. I wish I had David and Al with me before this. Yeah well, you had your Mother. Yeah. But they're more interesting. David, Al. It's an artistic smash. Thank you. Thank you, Edie. It's not finished yet. That is is only 1/100th of what it will look and sound like when we're done. I'll have to call up every one of my relatives and tell them I'll never speak to them again if they don't go to see it. Edie, have you seen Whiskers? Where's that kitty? That's Mother's new favorite cat... ears like a Russian boar. She just loves him and he disappeared. Now, David, this film is very advanced... just like the way that the New Wave changed cinema, although I never did get out to see the New Wave. Oh my God... abroad! They're going to love it in Europe. Do you think you can make it to the premier? We could really use you there. No no no, I don't think so. That's not for me, not my kind of thing. Oh, but I wish you all the luck in the world. We're going to see you at the premiere, right? We're going to paint the town red together. If you don't win 90 prizes for this movie, I'll be very surprised. Thank you. Goodbye, Al. Goodbye, Edie. Goodbye, David. - Goodbye, Edie. You were magnificent, Mother darling. You stole the show. I looked fat. Didn't Grey Gardens look terrific? Huh. Help me into my rolling chair. I can't stand up any longer. I would think I'll just be having to travel all the time... Paris, London, Rome... finally. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, and the premiere! That'll be something. I wouldn't go to that premiere if I were you. But, Mother, you heard Al. They need me there. That film is a work of art. I think it would be a terrible mistake. Besides you've already seen it. Why don't you put on that orchestration of "Tea for Two"? Why would it be a mistake? I don't think you see yourself the way others see you. You're a... a... I'm what? You're an acquired taste, babe. Now let's just forget the whole thing, okay? Now go get that record. We need some music. Whiskers? Whiskers! Whiskers! You just can't stand that the whole world is going to know the truth. About what? About how you've held me back all these years. It's all in that picture. Did we just watch the same movie? I'm going to that premiere. No, you don't leave. You say you will, but you never do. Now let's have that song. No! It's not going to work this time. This is my chance! Don't you see that? No, you had your chance and you missed out. Yeah, because I had to come home... No no. ...to take care of you. That married man was not going to do anything for you at all, Edie. You stuck me in this goddamn house! Nobody stuck anybody anywhere. If you're stuck, Edie, it's only with yourself! Edie! Edie. Edie! Whiskers. You ran away, huh, boy? Mother was apoplectic. She needs you. Edie, is that you? Oh, my heart. Bring him here. Huh! Now why did you run away the way you did, huh? Oh, Whiskers. I won't go to New York. I got it all wrong, didn't I? It was all my fault, wasn't it? I should have let you stay in New York. I could have gone any time. Edie, I need your help. Here, take my hand. - No no no no no no no. In the closet under the stairs there's a little yellow box. It's hidden back behind. I want you to get it for me. Go on, go get it. Can you find it, Edie? Your wedding jewels. You've kept these all this time? I was saving them for you. You should have sold them. God knows we needed the money. Things could have been different. There's nothing to regret. Besides, they weren't mine to sell. They've always been yours. You can wear them to that premiere. Okay, old gal. I said nothing but sensible sentences in that picture, didn't I? Oh yes, Mother. You're a star. Oh, no. You're a star. No no, you're a star. So, Edie, how'd it go, chicken? Mrs. Beale? This is Walter Goodman of "The New York Times." I was wondering if you had any comment on the Maysles's "Grey Gardens"? No, Mr. Goodman. It's all in the movie. Mrs. Beale? Hmm. It's all in the movie. Will you sing us another song, Edie? You really want me to? Okay. Thank you. All I can say is happy new year! No animals were harmed in the making of this movie.
