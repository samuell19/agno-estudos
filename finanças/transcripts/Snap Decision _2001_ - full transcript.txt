Girls! Turn that thing down! Wait, I got you. Hey, Hey. Hey. How many times? She told me to. Did not! Well, is she your boss, or am I your boss? Huh? You're just my mommy. Same thing. Luke, where you going? Lauren, go help him put on his PJs. Then can I stay up till Carrie gets here? Me too, me too! No. She's my godmother, Sophie. Well, she's mine too. Come on! Nobody is staying up, okay? Carrie gets in very late. Go do what I asked you to do. And you, miss, settle down, brush your teeth, okay? Okay. "And all of them can eat. "First the foal was quite stunned, "but soon he began running around, "swishing his black tail." That's all we have time for tonight. We'll read some more tomorrow. Mom, can Carrie wake me up for just one second? You have to wait till the morning. Boo. Boo, too. A-boo-whoo! No, no, no, no! No giggling. Calm. No giggling. Calm. Now, it's time to close your beautiful eyes and go to bed. I love you. Mommy? Is there a phone in heaven? 'Cause I wanna tell Daddy to call us. No, baby. Daddy talks to you here and here. Okay? Okay. Good night. Night, baby. Thanks for helping me with Luke tonight. You're really good with him. You're welcome. Sleep tight. Don't close the door all the way. I won't. Night night. Carrie! Hi! Hi, hi, hi! Come here! Hi. Oh. Oh. Oh, look. Lauren! Look how tall you are! Oh, and strong. Oh, I've missed you. I missed you, I missed you, I missed you, I missed you! How long are you staying? Three whole days. Your picture was in the newspaper. It was? Today. Big article about the whole conference and everything. It was great. The surgeon general is coming. Yeah? Pretty big deal, huh? Come on, I'm gonna tuck you back in because it's very late. And we've got all day tomorrow. Up! Go ahead. Go, grab this, go, go! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Be quiet. It gets so cold downstairs at night the kids make me set up their tent in the living room, and then they pretend like they're camping out. I told you last winter you needed a new furnace, Jen. Not in the budget. I'll pay for it. Oh! Why won't you let me help you? 'Cause I don't need it. You've always been like this. Like, you have to do everything by yourself. And being self-reliant is a bad thing? No, but, when I was sick with chemo and you took care of me, all I ever did to thank you was throw up all over you. Not every time. Besides, this is a celebration. This is for you. We're really, really proud of you. They're putting my photographs up in the lobby on display. Yeah, that's cool. No, cool is that they've hired me to do a photo shoot of the conference. Oh, that's great. Hired me! Really? It's called a "grip and grin." So you're a pro. Congratulations. Are you thrilled? I am so thrilled. Futon's mine. No way. No! Yeah. I'm not discussing this. My house, my rules. Get out. You are way bossy. It's freezing, it's late... Get off of my bed. You're a real mother, you know? Careful. So, are you gonna get up early and go running? I thought I'd sleep in. Yeah, right. Who are these little hoodlums? That's me! Sophie, it's you, it's you, it's you! Get over here! Oh, God, you're so early! Wanna come to the farmers' market with us? Oh, no, I'm gonna take a slow morning. Wait, you two are just absolutely gorgeous. I wanna read you a story. Oh. You can't read. Course I can. She memorizes. I'll show you. Over the speed limit, miss. Look at me, honey. Lauren. Did you wake her up after I explicitly asked... No. Bring that good-looking guy over here. Aw. Shy phase. Lauren, I want you to go get dressed, okay? Please, don't argue. But, Mom... Please, come on. Sarah's coming. All right. Is Sarah coming? Yes, she's coming. She's coming. My mom called today. Oh. She said to tell you hi. How are they doing? Well, I don't know. My dad's health is getting worse. I don't want that. You like that guy? You don't want it? It's a little rough. We're gonna go visit them this summer. Hey. Look, it's Carrie! It's Carrie. I guess at that age, every time I show up, I'm a stranger all over again. You oughta move here. Oh, you oughta move to Chicago. I couldn't do that to Rick's parents. You guys getting any closer? We're civil. I don't know... They probably think I'm too permissive, and I probably still hold them at arm's length. I don't think that they ever thought I was good enough for him. The day that Barbara saw me, seven months pregnant, in a bikini, I knew I was toast. Hey, buddy! Sophie Josephine, it's too cold for you to be running around butt naked! Get dressed. I'm reading. There's no time, honey. One minute. Okay, okay. Careful. Whoo! Ready? You guys! You guys are as cute as buttons. Hey, I laid your clothes out. I didn't wanna wear that top. Well, all right. Wear what you want. Just put something on. My mom. Easy. Careful! Watch out for Luke. Don't. Easy. Welcome to the chaos. Careful, you guys. Careful of Luke. Lauren. Sarah at the door. Come on, baby. That's Sarah at the door! Wait, who's Sarah? Oh, she used to babysit for me. We just became really good friends. Oh. Get dressed! Okay. All right. Sophie, get off me. Okay, come on, now. We have to get dressed. No, seriously. Seriously. Come on! You better be getting dressed up there. I am! I am. Sophie. Don't make me ask you again. Get! Is Sarah coming? Who's at the door? One more... Who is it? Who's at the door? Hi. Aw, my little linebacker. Aw. Please tell me you're early. I'm early. I just thought you could use a little extra help this morning. I get you. You got me. Let me guess, your houseguest is awake? Yeah, she's up there egging 'em on. Here, let me help you. Oh, thank you. You don't want get me. I won't. What's going on up there? They're having a field day. I bet. Go on. I better see progress! Oh, hi! Oh, God. Okay, hurry, hurry before she gets here. Is this yours? This isn't progress. It's my fault. Carrie, this is Sarah. Sarah, this is Carrie. Hi. I feel like I know you. Lauren, don't touch the camera. Oh, no, it's okay. I said she could. Um, hi. Hi. The kids talk about you all the time. They just adore you. Oh, and I saw your photographs in that magazine, awesome. I mean, I could never sky-dive in a billion years. Higher, Soph. No! Don't. Well, it's just a question of taking that first step. Yeah, but photographing? Awesome. Sophie! Whoa! Ooh! Sweetheart! Well, now maybe you won't jump. Huh? Scared her. It scared her. You're all right, sweetie. You wanna see something funny? Uh-uh. It's really funny. You're gonna laugh. Yes, you are. I'm wearing Ted's underwear! Let me see! Let me see! Me too, me too. Whoo! Again, again! Whoo! They're the only things that would fit this morning and that were clean. Whoo! Come on, big guy! Let's go get dressed, come on. Lauren, give Carrie the camera, grab your clothes, and let's go to your room. Come on, girls. Come on. Let's go to your room. Gotta get dressed now. Let's go get you dressed. 'Cause we're going to the market. Do we have to? You absolutely, 100% have to. And next, Carrie Dixon, whose extraordinary photographs are on exhibit out in the lobby. Three years cancer-free. Six months after completing chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, Carrie became an active and a tireless advocate for cancer awareness, helping to organize marathons and walkathons throughout the country. Most recently, Carrie organized and led a group of 12 other survivors on a sky-dive. So, for your character, your courage, and your generous spirit, we salute you. - Bye. - Oh, I'll miss you. Bye. - Love you. - Love you. Okay, all right. Go inside, it's freezing. Don't be sad. I'll be back soon. Yeah, Johnson's here for those two sheets. Hey. Hi. Lot of pictures. Yeah. Two-day conference that I shot. Hey, Randy. Hi. I have to have the prints by the end of the week. Oh, that shouldn't be a problem. You can still make the night batch. I can have your contact sheets for you tomorrow morning. Great. See you tomorrow. Randy, where did these come from? Same batch, Carrie Dixon. Cute. Huh. I thought I put these away. Ms. Dixon, my name is Detective Braden. We'd like to ask you some questions. What about? Why don't we talk about that downtown? Could you please tell me what this is about? Please be seated. Sit down, please. All right. Do you recognize these pictures? Where... Where did you get these? Did you take them? Yes. I've never seen this contact sheet that... Did my lab give this to you? Can you tell me who the children are, please? They're my godchildren. Look. Their mother is my best friend, you can call her. You can call her right now. All right, all right. We just want to hear it from you. Um, yes, sir. From the beginning. These are my godchildren. I went to college with their mother. I've known her forever. Uh, Jen Bradley, these are her kids. Last Tuesday I went to Cincinnati to visit my best friend. I watched this little girl being born, that's Lauren, that's Sophie, that's Luke. I was there for an award. Um... You've been very helpful, Ms. Dixon. But, I mean, what happens now? Well, first of all, we have to verify that these are the facts, and if they are, then... They are, I promise you. Good. Then that'll be the end. I'm sure you understand that when children are involved we have to... No. Yes, absolutely. I do. I think child pornographers are the lowest of the low. Lock 'em up, throw away the key. But, there's nothing lewd or lascivious about these pictures. They're, they're... Hey. Sorry. Look, it's the eye of the beholder, I guess. Look, I'm sure your photo lab was just trying to follow the law as they understood it. I'd be happy to give them a call for you. No, thank you. I think I'd like to talk to them myself. Okay. Sometimes it's just best to let things go. No, I'm telling you, Jen, nothing. The kind of pictures everyone has. I mean, I think you're in one, Sarah... I think they're all totally innocent pictures. Man, when I get my hands on that photo-lab woman... Ugh! What a complete nightmare. Oh. Pour yourself a drink, girl. Yeah. But he completely believed you, the detective? Oh, yeah, totally. I mean, he's a really reasonable, professional guy. I mean, like I said, they'll be contacting you to, you know, verify everything. Oh, but, Jen, I was literally shaking the whole time I was sitting there. I was so scared. But, I was mad, too, you know? I mean, I think they searched my apartment before I got home. Got in and went through my things. Jeez! I'm like, "Yes, sir, no, sir." Ugh! It was so awful. Well, I'm glad you can laugh about it now. I guess we have to feel grateful that they take this kind of thing so seriously. But, man. If it had been me, I probably would have broken down in tears or started throwing something. Did they give you the contact sheet back? The police? Yeah. I, I didn't think to ask. I'm sure they will. Why? I don't know. I don't like strangers having it. Well... Hey, we were gonna go up to Sarah and Ted's cabin for a couple of days. Do you think maybe we shouldn't? I mean, in case they call. No, you should definitely go ahead and go. He'll call, and he'll leave a message, you'll call him back. I mean, he basically told me there was nothing to worry about. So... Okay. Love you. Okay. I love you guys, too. Nighty-night. Mom, hurry! Come on, Mom! We're ready to go! - I'm coming! - Come on, babe. I'll make it! Okay. I have to go. Hello, Ms. Dixon. How are... Where's my other roll of film I gave you 20, you gave me 19 back. For that matter, where's my other contact sheet? I don't want any trouble here. You don't? I'm the one the police interrogated. How could you do that? I've been doing business here for years. How could you think that about me? I had to report it. No, you didn't. There's a law about pictures of children. If I didn't report it, I could lose my business. The law allows you to use your discretion. I did! We never get those kinds of pictures in this lab. I don't know who those children are. I don't know what's going on. Well, the police do, because they asked me. And they're fine about it. They're my godchildren! Anyway, there's nothing pornographic about those pictures! My bill in full. I'll be taking my business elsewhere. And my other roll of film. The police have it. You can't get more out of me than I got, Carol. Aw... Yeah, well, look, we'll talk about this later. What? This just came in from Chicago PD. Hey, this is John Collins. I need some photos enlarged ASAP. Oh, ma'am? Pardon me. Can I have a word with you? There we go. A little faster? Yeah! Mrs. Bradley? Yes? I'm Detective Collins. I'm trying to locate your daughter-in-law, Jennifer Bradley. Whoo! Whoo! You wanna check this out? Well, it certainly looks like they're coming back. I, uh... I looked in the children's rooms. Pretty nice... Books, toys. What kind of books? Books... Children's books. You think this kind of thing only happens in trailer parks? I grew up in a trailer park, Detective, so, no, I don't think that. Are you holding up your part of the sky, Ms. Hunt? I try to. Hmm. Nothing? Nothing in her computer files. She's got all the tools, though... Internet, scanner, software. Course, she could have erased everything. Talman said they'll be back tomorrow. Yeah, well... They better be. And those kids better be all right. - Wanna jump? - Sorry we're late. Okay. I've got Luke! Keep going. I think I got everything. That was a blast. Thanks, Ted. Hey! The kids are in the kitchen. I'll get the car seats from you later. That was so fun. Thanks, Sarah. Take care! We'll drop the car seats off tonight. Bye! Bye. Ms. Bradley? Hi. I'm Eliza Hunt. I'm from Children's Protective Services. Oh. Oh! Regarding the matter of the photographs taken of your children. Right. Well, I thought somebody would just call from Chicago, but come on in. Let me just, uh... Get the children. Come on. Sophie... Mommy! I'll be right back. You gotta give Mommy a break. Give me just a little bit of privacy, okay? Sorry. I don't want them to hear any of this. Can I make you coffee or... No, thanks. Water? Thanks. Oh... Sorry. Now, you know the pictures that I'm talking about? Yes. I haven't actually seen them, but I was there when they were taken. But, I mean, even if I wasn't there, I'd trust Carrie with my children's lives. Uh-huh. I mean, she's even in my will as their guardian, so... I appreciate... You're just trying to do your job. I get it. Feel free to ask me anything that you wanna ask. I just wanna say right up front, this whole thing is a colossal mistake. Carrie's like a sister to me. She's a wonderful... Ms. Bradley, I'm very sorry. This is a judge's order to temporarily remove your children. What? Until the case can be investigated... Wait, excuse me... "Investigated?" ...and the children can be interviewed. Just a sec. Your children must be interviewed. M No way. You're not gonna interview my kids. Look, I know how this must feel... You don't know anything! They are just beginning to get past their father's death. You can't do this. If you have to talk to them, talk to them here with me... here, but don't take them. Their grandparents have agreed to keep them... Their grandparents? You talked to Barbara and Jack? I... Have you seen the pictures? If you'll get the children packed, I'll be able to... You're not taking my kids anywhere. Get out. Get out! Ms. Bradley, I'd rather do this calmly for the children's sake, but there's a policeman waiting outside if you refuse to cooperate. No! No! God! No, I... Good. I thought that being at their grandparents' would be least traumatic for them. Yeah. Yeah. I'll drive them over. No, I will. I'm afraid... Well, then you can have their grandparents come and pick 'em up here! I don't want my kids to know there's anything wrong. And I don't want them to know what you are insinuating about their godmother! You understand me? That's my arm. One more. Hey, guess what? Great news. Grammy and Poppa are coming to pick you guys up. Why? You get to go and visit them for a couple of days. I wanna stay home. Well, I think they have some pretty nice plans for you guys. And, you know, I have a website to work on for my boss. He even sent some people over to help me get it done in time, so it's not gonna be very much fun around here. All right. Okay? Luke, you wanna go see Grandpa? Huh? And play with him in his shop? Yeah! Luke is going, too? Yeah, Luke, too. He's a big guy now. He'll just cry. You're just gonna have to hold him very close, okay, Lauren? Okay. Just hold him close and help him out. You can walk by yourself, but we gotta go figure out what to take to Grammy and Grandpa's house, okay? Head upstairs. Upstairs! What kind of an animal goes, "Hee" Huh This is wrong. Why? The girls are too old to have anyone taking naked pictures of them, Jennifer. I mean, when they were babies, maybe, but... Hey, monsters! Let the kids call me when they get to your house, okay? I... Well, I don't think I can do that. Why? I told Lauren... Why can't the kids call me? Look, I'm sure this will all be cleared up, and, and... Goodbye, Jennifer. Now, we know their routines. They'll be safe with us. I assure you, we want to cause as little trauma to the children... Why can't my kids call me? The police have obtained a no-contact order, which means you're temporarily restrained from having any contact with the children. Ms. Bradley, I'd rather do this calmly, for the children's sake. A judge has ordered to temporarily remove your children till the case can be investigated and the children can be interviewed. No! Mrs. Bradley? Mrs. Bradley. Why are you doing this? What is it that you wanna know? Just ask me! Ask me now! Don't take them! Your children are safe with their grandparents, Mrs. Bradley. Protecting them is our first priority. I'm sure, as their mother, you appreciate that. My kids don't need protection from me. Then you have nothing to worry about. I'm Detective Collins. This is my card. Please come in and see me in the morning, and we'll... No, now! We'll do it right now. I'll get my coat. Mrs. Bradley. In the morning. Say, 10:30? I'll be there. I don't have anything to hide. I'm a good mom! I'm... Good. Jen? Steve. Hi. Hi. Long time. Yeah, I'm sorry. You okay? No, not really. I need your help. Hello? Carrie? Hey, Jen, I was just... They took the kids away. What? A woman from Social Services came with a detective, and they took the kids over to Barbara and Jack's. I cannot believe this! This is insane. They can't do that. They have no right. I'm gonna meet with Steve Godwin down at the courthouse, first thing in the morning. He's gonna try and get the no-contact order overturned. I don't know what happens after that. Oh, this is crazy. The police here were fine about it. The house is so quiet. Oh, Jen, honey, I'm coming. I'm coming tonight. No, I'm all right. I'll call you as soon as I know anything. I promise. Oh, uh, all right. Okay. Bye. Bye. Is this Detective Collins? My name is Steve Godwin. I represent Jennifer Bradley. No, she's not coming. She's at her in-laws. And Detective, I'd like to be present whenever you do speak to my client. Hey. I just canceled your appointment with Detective Collins. What'd he say? Well, he kinda hung up on me, so I'd say he wasn't too happy. That's two of us, then. Jen, I gotta be in court in half an hour. You'll be okay? Yeah. Let me practice, though. Do you have the papers? Okay. Yeah. Hand it to them, say, "Judge Morse of the family court "issued this an hour ago. "Unless your interview uncovers a reason not to..." Which it won't... "My children are to be immediately returned to my custody." That's it. Great. But, you got my beeper number just in case? Yeah. Thanks, Steve. You don't have to thank me, Jen. I took being Rick's best man seriously. I still do. Did you tell Collins that you got his order overturned? He'll find out soon enough. The guy knows he doesn't have any basis for a no-contact order. I bet the Chicago police only sent him the contact sheet so that you could verify those were in fact your children. They didn't show me a thing. I think that's the social worker. Yeah. - Who's that with her? - A child psychologist. Do you want me to... No, no, no. I got it. Good to go. Good luck. Thanks. Knee... Butt... Stomach... Vagina... Elbow. Good... Very good. I wonder, Lauren... Do you know about good touching and bad touching? Has anyone talked to you about that? Yeah, my mom told me. If anyone ever touched you in a bad way, what would you do? Somebody did. Who? One time, this boy at school last year, he tried to pull down my gym shorts on the playground, and I told my teacher, 'cause that's what my mom told me to do. And his parents got real mad at him, and he had to apologize, 'cause that wasn't nice. No. No, it wasn't. You did the right thing. Has a grown-up ever touched you in a bad way? No. Your turn, Sophie! No. I'm eating ice cream. It's Sophie's turn. Well, honey, you can take your ice cream in there. Oh, no, not in the front... Can I reach it? Here you go, babe. Give me your spoon. Get your spoon. No. You don't want it? Mmm-mmm. Well, it'll be right here when you get out. It's easy, Sophie. They just wanna know what it's like to be a kid. We'll be, uh, not too long. Come on, Lauren. Let's get you some ice cream. - All right. - I wanna get down. I draw on table. Look at my hand. They're great kids, Jen. Look, uh... I hope you don't blame us for all this, you know... We love these kids. It would kill Barbara if... if you didn't let her see them anymore. Do you really think I would ever do that? Well, you might think that you have cause. You just don't know me at all, do you? Uh... Grandpa, I draw on table! Where's Sophie? She was here, then she disappeared. I don't know where she is! I'm back, I'm back! I came back! Oh, thank goodness for that. Ooh! Hi. You better take her home, Mrs. Bradley, before she disappears again. She's very magical, isn't she? Whoo! Excuse me. What happens now? Well, you take your children home, and I file my report with the court and the police. And your report will be... Well, I see no reason for further investigation by our department. Ms. Bradley, I've seen the contact sheet, and quite honestly, to me, it looked like what you said. It seemed pretty innocent. If this wasn't all so insane, I might thank you. You have very nice children. Yeah, I know. Here we are! We're ready! Okay! We're ready! Hi, guys. Hi. Hey, where have you been? Sorry about that. Sweetie, Brandi'll get you out. Come on, Sophie. How are you? Brandi! Oh, here... Watch your head. Thank you. You're welcome. Here we are. Brandi, we didn't go to school today. We got surveyed. Wow. First things first, you guys put your stuff away, right? You're gonna have to help Luke off with the snow boots, okay? I gotta run to the store. I'll be right back. Okay. You can let them watch cartoons. Okay. Okay. See you, guys. Oh, you need juice. Right. Okay, let's go inside. Be there, be there, be there. Hello? Carrie, it's me. The kids are home. Oh, thank God! Oh! Thank God. And, um... And they're okay? Yeah. They tested them, but they're fine. Oh, Jen, I haven't even been able to breathe. So, tell me, tell me. It's okay. The social worker said she saw the contact sheet. And she didn't think there was anything wrong with the pictures. Of course not, because there isn't. Oh, hooray for our side! Um, so, did she tell the police that? Well, if she hasn't, she will. The whole thing just makes me so mad. But you know what? My mother-in-law said something... This detective told Barbara that the Chicago police were planning on charging you. I'm... I think, you know, he said it to just... make me scared or whatever, but I, I do think that you should talk to an attorney. Hello? Uh, yeah... I'm here. Well, I'm sure it's just what you said, that it's just talk, Yeah. but at least you guys are out of it. That's the most important thing. I am so relieved. Me too. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. I'm here at the market, I gotta go in and get dinner, but I'll call you tonight. Okay? All right. Love you. Okay. Love you. Bye. Bye. - Here comes Mom! - Here comes Mommy. I found it. What did Mommy find? Yay! Telephone. Say, "Hello." Hello. Ay, ay, ay. Thanks for doing this, Sarah. No problem. I was up half the night trying to get this website finished. Please, God... I hope my boss likes it. They will. They always do. I shouldn't be long... Hello. But if I do get jammed... Hi, baby. Brandi will be here when the girls get back from school. Okay, great. Hello. Give Mommy a kiss. Give me a kiss. Bless your heart. Oh, please, God, be the plumber. The downstairs bathroom is jammed again. Please, God, let that be the plumber! Be good for Sarah, baby. Jennifer Bradley? I'm Jennifer Bradley. Detective Harris, Cincinnati Police. I have to ask you to come with me. I have a warrant for your arrest. Jen? What? Jen, what's going on? I have to handcuff you, Ms. Bradley. No. No, this is a mistake, but I'll just go with you. It's just... I'm sorry, Ms. Bradley. Don't. Jen, what's going on? Sarah, don't let Luke see. Sarah, call Steve Godwin. The number's in my book. Okay. It's procedure. There you go. Make a left turn here. Sorry you couldn't make it in yesterday, Mrs. Bradley. Do you normally arrest people for canceling their appointments? I do sometimes. Sit right in that chair. I want my lawyer here. Well, you see, now... That's what bothers me. I, uh... I mean, you have every right to your attorney, but I just have to wonder why you think you need one. You took my children! And you got them back. Yeah. So why have you arrested me? The social worker said... I'm not a social worker, Mrs. Bradley. I'm a cop. They do their job, I do mine. And you know something else I find very curious? You haven't even asked about the photographs. You haven't asked to see them. I mean, if the police came to me and told me they had pornographic pictures... They're not pornographic. They're innocent pictures. 36 of them, Mrs. Bradley? 36 photos of naked and seminaked kids. And adults! Adults cavorting with them. "Cavorting?" Who posed your children in these photographs, Mrs. Bradley, you or your friend? No one posed my kids. Two unclothed little girls lying on top of each other? Stop it! Don't you dare! I'm not gonna listen to this. They were playing around. I was there. Yes, you were! Yes, you were and you didn't do a thing to stop it! What are you saying? 'What are you charging me with, exactly? Child abuse. Four counts of felony child abuse and pornography. You're facing up to 50 years in prison, Mrs. Bradley. I wanna call my lawyer. Then this thing he said about me not asking to see the pictures... I mean, of course I want to see them, but I wasn't gonna ask him . Why? Because I didn't want to look at them with him standing there. And I certainly didn't want him to think that I needed to see them, like I didn't trust Carrie or something. The guy doesn't like me. He doesn't. And I don't like him. He got weasel eyes. The chemistry is very bad between us. It's just bad. Out on bail. Surreal. I got a friend in the D.A.'s office. First thing in the morning, I'll see about getting the charges dropped. You think you can? He's certainly gonna be a lot more reasonable than this Collins has been. Bad chemistry, cop on a crusade... Whatever. Arresting you is way over the top. They can't come and take the children again, right? They can't. They have to prove the charges first, that would mean going to trial. I just don't think it'll come to that. Thanks for this, Steve. No thanks necessary. You were the best thing that ever happened to Rick and the best mom ever, except for my own. You go on in now. Hey. Hi. Are you all right? Is everybody in bed? I'm home. Just a long day at work. Everything's fine. You can go to sleep now. I must have called the station a hundred times. They won't give me my film, Jen. The police wouldn't give it to you? No. They said they can't give me my film back until the investigation here is completed. Well, then why did you fly all the way here? Because, I wanted to tell you in person. And maybe get yourself arrested here? Nobody knows I'm here. I can describe the pictures to you. I don't need them described. Well, none of them looked posed. I know. He said there were 36 of them. Did you take 36 pictures? Yeah, I guess. I always take hundreds of shots. You know that. Yes... 36 pictures. I wish you had told me you couldn't get them. I would not have let you come here. What if I'm being followed? What if you are? Maybe they even tapped our phones. You think they don't do stuff like that? Yes, I do, but I don't think we should get so paranoid... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. They take the kids. They arrest me. I mean... Every time the phone rings or the doorbell rings, I'm like... I know, I know. But I just think they want us to be paranoid. They've got us shaking in our boots, not knowing what's gonna happen next. It's a total abuse of power, is what it is, and we can't let them get away with it. You know what we need to do? We need to go to the press with this. What? Yes. There are so many issues. Police, First Amendment, privacy. Oh, Carrie, God! This is not some cause that we go marching around in front of the White House about. Yes, it most certainly is, and we've done it before. I have children now. All the more reason! Children I want to protect. I don't want them to ever hear these charges. I don't want the words in their heads, ever. I want to protect them, too. I don't want them to get some screwed-up idea about their bodies, that they carry around for the rest of their lives. Well, I... I'm not sure that's the best way to protect them. Well, I think maybe we just have very different ways of looking at this. I'm gonna go. Don't. And I want you to get on the next plane and go back home. And stay there until this whole thing is over. Be more careful, Carrie. You have to be more careful. Please... Take care of yourself. Jen? What? Sorry if I scared you. Your babysitter let me in. Brandi, would you please see to the children? Thank you. I thought we could talk. Without my lawyer? Well... I'll talk. I felt a little bad about the way I treated you, Mrs. Bradley, like I was a little rough, maybe, jumped to conclusions without giving you a fair chance. I, uh... Do a lot of cases involving children, and, uh... It keeps you awake at night, some of the low-lifes you meet... People you'd never guess. Even their best friend would never guess. Maybe you weren't even in the room when most of those pictures were taken. Maybe she took those photos without your permission, and then she lied about it and asked you to lie for her. Is that's what going on here? I really would like for you to leave. Okay, all right. Sure. Sure. But, you know, you think this person's your friend because you've known her a long time, but how well do you really know her? Very well... I know her very well. Well, pedophiles are very secretive people, and she is certainly a very secretive person. She's an unmarried woman who lives alone in another state and travels constantly. Who's recovering from cancer. All kinds of people get cancer, Mrs. Bradley! Shh! Shh! Mommy, is that you? I have two sons. Twins. And if I found out that someone had betrayed their trust... My trust! I would do something about it. I would stop it! There's nothing to stop! Leave, please. I'm trying very hard to give you the benefit of the doubt, Mrs. Bradley, but I need some encouragement, you understand? You have very beautiful kids. Beautiful kids. And they should be your first priority, not your friend. Hi, it's Jennifer Bradley. Is Steve in? Can you have him call me as soon as he's available? Thank you. Mom? Hey, guess what? - Cookie break. - Yay! You guys help Luke down the stairs. Brandi and I will be right down, okay? Hold his hand! Brandi... Please don't ever let anyone inside the house without coming and telling me. Oh, well, he said he was a policeman. He showed me his badge... Right. I was witness to an accident. Oh, was it a bad one? No... Kind of. I'll be right down. Just next time, call me to the door. Okay. Okay. Hello? Steve, thank you for calling me right back. Collins was just here. What? When? How can they indict me without our even knowing about it? That's how the grand jury works, Jen. They only consider the prosecutor's evidence. What evidence did they show 'em? I would assume the photographs. The photographs. When do I get to see them? I keep calling, they keep stalling me. So, what happens now? We need to begin preparing for a trial. Okay. Start... We have to decide whether to present your case before a jury or a judge. I get to choose? Yes, but first I want to get together a focus group. People like the ones who could end up on your jury. I want to show them the photographs. Why? Well, the law requires that the photographs be deemed, "offensive to the prevailing standards in the adult community, "with respect to what is suitable activity for juveniles." We need a sense of what those prevailing standards are. Well, I think jumping around on your own bed in your own house is pretty suitable activity for juveniles, don't you? Yes, I do. We need to start putting a witness list together. Will Carrie be willing to come back and testify? Wouldn't that be dangerous thing for her to do? Yes, they could arrest her. Then I can't ask her to do it. You may have to, Jen. Hey. They indicted me. What? There'll have to be a trial. Oh, God! This doesn't seem like America, that they could do that! I mean... Jen, I have to be honest with you. I can understand why they'd want to talk to you and make sure everything was all right. I agree with you completely. I was there. There was nothing ugly going on. Nobody's talked to me. Sarah, I feel really terrible about this, but Carrie thinks that there might be a photograph of you on the contact sheet, too. Of me? No. No, I don't remember Carrie taking my... You should have called me right away. Well, you knew it yesterday. I'm not chastising... Yes! I am. Don't leave me out on these things. Have they set a trial date yet? Steve says a couple of months. What's your strategy? I don't know what our strategy's gonna be. My only strategy right now is not to explode. I better go. Bye. Hey! Where'd you come from? I parked down the street. What's wrong? Oh, Jen... I'm being called as a witness... For the prosecution. Ted talked to a lawyer, and he said that I probably shouldn't see you till all this is over. But I wanted to tell you. Jen, Ted is so mad... Not at you. He's worried about you and the baby. Yeah. I don't blame him. Please tell him that. I don't know why they think I'll be a good witness. I'm so sorry. Take care of yourself. Yeah... Okay. - Hey. - HI. When did you get them? This morning. Have you seen them? Yes. The prints were taken directly from Carrie's contact sheet. Right. What kind of a sick, twisted mind do you have to be to see something here? They are so obviously playing. What's this one about? I don't know, unless it's to make it look like you and Carrie slept in the same bed. We didn't, but what difference would that make? What's wrong with this one? A semi-clothed adult and an unclothed child. The adult is not the child's mother. Yeah How can they do this? How can they? It's just... How can they? Jen! Oh, hi, Dee Dee. Hey, I haven't seen you around lately. Yeah, I was... I've been really busy working, but the kids are great. Oh, good. See you! You too. Thank you, Miss Amy! Lauren! Is that spider bite still itching? Yeah. We'll put something on it when we get home. All right. Listen, honey, I think you're getting old enough now to where you shouldn't lift up your shirt in public, okay? But it's all right. I can't lift up my shirt, either. Mom? I thought you were sleeping. I'm sleepwalking. Sleepwalk over here. You're my little night owl. Yeah. Your daddy was a night owl. I'm just like him. Mom, why doesn't Sarah come over anymore? Is she mad at us? No. Sarah would never be mad at you. She just has to take it very easy, you know? For the baby. Oh. She would never be mad at you. Yeah. Oh, you can't stay here. You just can't. I can help with the kids. I'm a great cook. Do you just want to be arrested? Is that gonna make you feel better? Because it's not me. It won't make any difference where I am if they decide to arrest me, Jen. Well, you don't have to draw a big circle around yourself with arrows flashing, "Here I am. "Take me to jail." Well, I'll keep a low profile. What if I don't want you here? I don't believe that. I've seen the pictures. Well, you didn't think that they were... No, of course... Carrie! How can you even ask me that? And I had to sit there and look at pictures of my kids and try and imagine how some sick people could think... I am barely hanging on here, okay? I don't want to have to reassure you, take care of you. You won't have to! Well, I can't! Enough. I mean, I just, I want it over. I just want out of it! You can be mad at me, Jen, but be madder at them. I am! Then let me stay, and you won't have to take care of me. Not at all. And if you want to vent and rage at me, that's fine. Right, and be the cause of your cancer coming back? Just what I want. You think being here is gonna be more stressful than being isolated in Chicago? You are my family, Jen. You've always been the one who takes care of everybody. Let me help take care of you guys. Please? Please let me stay. Please? We'll tell the kids I'm... Have an assignment. Just go day by day! Oh, please? Be right back. Whoa, you got it? Got it? Ah! Man, I wish I had just half their energy. Any word from Steve yet on the focus groups? No. He'll call as soon as they finish. Well, I'm sure as soon as they put this in front of ordinary people... Smile! What? Smile for Lauren! Oh. Oh, look what he's found. Lauren asked me why you weren't taking any pictures. Oh. What'd you tell her? That you were giving your eyes a vacation. Hmm. I don't know, Jen. Maybe it'd be better just to tell them what's going on. Oh, Carrie... Lauren's no dummy. She knows something's the matter. She's seven years old. What... How you gonna explain it to her? Are you gonna tell her to keep it a secret from her 4 They're too young! No! I'm their mother. It's not open for debate. Hi. Hi. Did you already meet with the focus group? I thought it'd be better to talk in person. Carrie. Hi, Steve. Long time, no see. I didn't know you were here. No. She's keeping a low profile. Well, I'm glad you're here. It takes courage. I'm hoping I won't have to call you. Can we talk about that another time? Hey, would you mind keeping the kids outside for a while? Sure. Sure. I guess it's bad news. The pictures bothered them, Jen. They may have pictures just like them of their own children, but... They don't know these children. And someone has said there's something wrong, and... the number of pictures bothered them. They were concerned about making a wrong decision and putting a child at risk. So, if they'd been on my jury, the decision would have been to convict. Better safe than sorry. A judge could decide the same thing. He could, but at least a judge is trained in the law. One person having your life in their hands... I... Then again, having to get up in front of 12 people... Well, I'm going to counsel you not to get in front of anybody. I don't want you to have to testify. Why? You think I might start screaming or something? That's part of the reason. I might, too. You haven't even asked Carrie to testify for you, have you? No. It's just, do you know what this feels like? It's like if I want to stay with my kids, I have to ask my best friend to go to prison. Hold on! Hold on! Really fast! Hey. If the focus group had been a real jury, they would have convicted me. Steve wants to put you on the witness list. Of course. I'll testify. That's a given. That's understood. Jen... Jen, don't. Stay and talk. Let me help. I've gotta go to my in-laws. I gotta ask them if they'll take the kids, if I can't... My folks are too old, and my dad's health... The court's not gonna let you. You're the one... My babies! Oh. My babies! It's not fair. It's not fair. No, no, it's not fair. It's wrong. It's wrong, but we will beat them. We are strong. I don't feel strong. I feel shattered. It's gonna be okay. Where's my purse? Just tell the kids I'm going to get dinner or something. Okay. Okay. Come on. Wait up. Lauren? Can I come in? Sophie said you weren't getting up today. You don't feel too good? Hmm? Does your tummy hurt? Finished! Good doggy! Sophie, I have your clothes all laid out on your bed. She's Harry the dog today. Lauren thinks you're dying. What? She thinks your cancer's back and that's why you're really here. We both look sad all the time. I'll go talk to her. And tell her what? I'll tell her whatever you want me to. Your house, your rules. Well, I said that we were both preoccupied with our work. Then that's what I'll say. All right, okay. You were right. I'm obviously not putting on as good a show as I thought. I don't think I was right. You were. They are too young to understand something like this. When they're older, maybe get a therapist to help. I'll pay for it. Don't. Sophie, put your clothes in the laundry for me, okay? Okay. Hi. I feel like I'm living in a fishbowl. I pray to God Steve can keep this out of the press. Listen, Jen, about the trial. You know, I can't be in the courtroom because I'm on the witness list. I know. Well, who are you gonna have in there with you? Because when the judge looks out, if we don't have some supporters there, we're gonna look like these creepy people everyone's abandoned. I could get my parents here. From London? No. I don't want my parents either. They don't even know. They should. My mom has enough problems. Quit protecting everyone. Maybe I'm protecting myself! I don't want people to know. What? That you've been unjustly accused of something? Don't let them make you feel ashamed. Do you think anyone who knows us is gonna believe this? Now, you've always been the practical one. Be practical now. I understand about our parents, but call Pam, ask her to come. She's a really good friend. She cares about you. And call your in-laws, too. We're not questioning the need for laws that protect children, Your Honor. Such laws are essential, and we fully support them. But the laws regarding child pornography are currently so vague and open to misinterpretation and misapplication, as in this case, that we're asking for dismissal of the charges based on constitutional grounds, as stated in our writ. Your Honor, we intend to present to the court 36 photographs featuring the children of the defendant. These photographs are child pornography by any community standards. It is the court's responsibility to see that the perpetrators of such a heinous crime be held accountable. We urge the court to reject the defendant's motion. Thank you. These are very serious charges, counselor. Felony child abuse, child pornography. I can't rule in a vacuum. I need to hear the evidence. Proceed, Mr. Schneider. Call your first witness. In what respect were you troubled by this contact sheet? Speaking as a professional. The sheer number of photographs, um, the fact that many of them appear to be posed, and the fact that the film was taken to another state to be developed. Anything else? Yes, the presence of two adult women, neither of whom was appropriately attired, in the same photographs with the children suggested to me these images were not entirely innocent. And why, in your experience, would that be a danger signal? Well, we know that one of the functions of child pornography is to lower children's inhibitions in a sort of a grooming process to model deviant behavior, and it appeared to me that that's the precise intention of those photographs. My God. And yet, in spite of the social worker's opinion and the psychologist's report, in spite of an investigation that revealed not one scintilla of evidence against Mrs. Bradley, you continued to pursue this case. Why? Because the pictures themselves are evidence of the abuse of innocent children. And because their own mother, Mrs. Bradley, participated in that... Abuse. No further questions, Your Honor. I call Sarah Hawkins to the stand. Sarah Hawkins. And after you arrived that morning, did you see Carrie Dixon take any photographs? I don't really remember. Maybe. It was just kind of chaos. You know, the way it is with three little kids running around. I remember Lauren playing with the camera. But I swear, Your Honor... Don't. But there was nothing bad... When I say, "Don't," don't. Yes, sir. You Honor, the state would like to introduce at this time exhibits three through eight. These are, these are blow-ups we've made from the contact sheet. How big are they? I don't know. Have you seen any of these photographs? No. So, when you say nothing bad was going on, you mean after you arrived? Well, yes. Before, too. So, you see nothing bad about an unclothed girl touching another girl's breast while an adult snaps a photograph of it? An adult unrelated to either child. This picture, Mrs. Hawkins, is child pornography by definition. Were you there, by the way, when this photograph was taken? Yes or no, please. No. What about this one? Were you there? Or this one? Next one, please. Two children lying on top of each other. Still see nothing bad? You mean to tell the court that there's nothing bad going on in this photograph? A 5-year-old child, her body exposed, being forcibly held by a semi Objection, Your Honor. It shows no such thing. That's exactly what it shows. You'll have your chance, counselor. Sit down. Is that you, Mrs. Hawkins? Yes. Could you explain to the court exactly what you are doing in this photograph? I was... I was, I was just acting silly. I was... Silly or perverted? This is truly outrageous. This is his own witness. If he wishes to declare her hostile... Question withdrawn. Nothing further. You may cross-examine, counselor. Let her go. She needs to explain the photograph. It's too hard for her. She doesn't look good. The judge needs to have it explained to him. I have no questions for this witness, Your Honor. Honestly, Jack, I can't believe that prosecutor. Hey. Oh, it's lunch break. The prosecution just rested. Okay. Hey. This is horrible. Boy, Jen, if this judge finds you guilty, I want you to pack those kids up and head for the border. This... It's a witch hunt. There's a diner across the street. You guys go right on ahead. I have to talk to Steve. He wants to say something. I'll stay with you. No, that's okay. Go with them. They can fill you in. Come here. Okay. They put a deal on the table. A deal? If I'm such a monster, why are they... Sorry. What is it? If you'll pled guilty to one count of child negligence and agree to supervision by social services, they'll drop the felony charges. Sup... Social services in my home? With the kids? You'll also be required to co-operate in any ongoing investigation. If I plead guilty, that's all the cooperation they need. They'll arrest Carrie before she's even out of this courthouse. She'll go to jail. And you'll stay at home with your kids. I just can't read this judge, Jen. I can't. I just can't. I'd be saying that I let Carrie take pornographic pictures of the kids, which I wouldn't. I didn't. She didn't. We've done nothing wrong. Nothing! All right. Here's how we'll proceed. When they come back in, I'll try again for a dismissal. But... Let me get up there. I promise I will stay calm. I promise. I want to stand up for myself. For my friends, for my family. I want to testify. - Did so. - Did not! Did so! Did not. Hi, guys. How was school today? Good. Okay. Is Mom's meeting over yet? Not yet. Do you recognize this photograph, Mrs. Bradley? Yes. In that one, Sophie is touching her older sister in the middle of her chest. Lauren is only seven... She does not have breasts. Why is Sophie touching Lauren? Their father died in a car accident almost three years ago, and since then, Sophie pats people. She pats everybody as though she's trying to make sure that they're really there. This is one of the few photographs from the contact sheet which show a different style of photography. Did Miss Dixon take this picture? No, Lauren did. She was playing around with the camera at the time. It's taken from a 7-year-old's angle. So, tell us who's in this picture, please. Sarah Hawkins is my dear friend. She... We met when she was a teacher at my kids' school. And then she quit because she wanted to get pregnant, which, obviously, she was blessedly successful. Your Honor? She was wearing her husband's underwear because she was pregnant and her own wouldn't fit. And she was just acting silly. Look at at the picture, it's obvious... Object. Sustained. Go on to the next picture, counselor. Do you recognize this picture from the contact sheet? I didn't at first, but it's... It's a close-up of just one corner of a picture that Lauren took. Sophie was jumping on the bed, and she got too close to the edge and she was falling, and Carrie jumped up to catch her. So this picture's been cropped, and one section blown up? Many of the photos have been cropped, Your Honor. Distorted. Yes, my kids were unclothed in many of these pictures, but Carrie did not zoom in on their bodies. She did not take close-ups of my children's private... They did that. No one had the right to take pictures, blow up my daughter's image, and put it on display. That's what's obscene. That's what pornographic. - Shame on you! Shame. - That's enough. That's enough, Mrs. Bradley. Your Honor, you've seen the photographs on the contact sheet. They are not the distortions put on display here. These are family photos, Your Honor. In our desire and determination to protect our children, we must be careful not to become the thing we hate. Your Honor, you're no longer ruling in a vacuum. I respectfully move that you dismiss these charges against my client. The sexual exploitation of a child is a heinous crime. Not only against that child, but against society itself. My own view on the matter is that we have become far too lax in this country, when it comes to the sexualization of our children. We put them up on billboards and on magazine covers, wearing nothing. Well... During the lunch hour, I went through a photo album I keep in my chambers. And I had to ask myself, what the prosecutor might make of a picture of my 2-year-old grandson running naked through the sprinklers. And there was his mother, wearing one of those bathing suits young people wear today, holding out her arms to him. My word, counselor, where is your sense of perspective? Where was your common sense? Who has done the real harm here? I don't know what evidence you presented to the grand jury, sir, but as far as this court is concerned, this case should never have been brought to trial. These charges are dismissed. I wanna go home and see the kids. All right, ten more minutes, and then you have to brush your teeth. Come on. Yes. Whoa! What's that for? Not that I don't like it. I don't want you to go. Well, I can only stay one day. But I'm not leaving till the morning, sweetie. I don't want you to go to Italy. Well, you'll... You'll like it when you come visit me! We're gonna come visit? I hope so. Ten more minutes, okay? All right. I want my song. Whew. What time does your flight leave? 10:50. You know, I never really thanked you, for staying with me. For helping me. For helping me learn to let people help me. Not easy for me. No, I know. Are you sure this is what you want to do? Move to Italy? Yes. No. I don't feel safe here. The police still won't give me my film back. I feel like I'm on somebody's list now. If affects everything I do. I don't even take pictures anymore. Oh. That's not good. You never used to let anything intimidate you. I'm older now. I wish I had them. The pictures. I love that one of Sophie with her hair flying. It was beautiful. Thanks. I wish you had them, too. Sometimes I think, "What if the prosecutor had been the judge?" You know? We came so close. You think something like this could never happen to you, and then when it does, you think, "Yeah, I just, I gotta tell the truth. "I'm a good person. I'm a good mom." I don't know. We were both so naive. Mmm. The world certainly feels like a scarier place to me now. With you gone, it's gonna feel a lot scarier. Come with me. I'll rent a big villa. You know I can't. I know. Carrie, Carrie! Take Sophie's picture! Take her picture, Carrie! Take her picture! I, oh... I don't have a camera. I have one. Take a picture! Take a picture of me! Take my picture! Take my picture! Take a picture, Carrie. Take my picture! The people speak. Take a picture! I'm beautiful! You are beautiful, Sophie. You are so beautiful. Me too!
