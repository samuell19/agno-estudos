Be good for your mom, yeah? Hope you're day's getting off to a good start. It's been nippy but sunny, here in Dublin anyway. I didn't recognize myself, and that's when I started to become ill. There are definitely other in between spaces. You know, there's this idea... No matter what time of day, we're always here for you, 24 hours... In the planning, air regulator would ensure that we had a planning system that works for the communities and works for the people, and doesn't just work for the developers. It should not be theirs. I know, I know. You're letting me down. No, I said it depends. Well, you're taking liberties. I have to get this thesis in by tomorrow. I had to get an extension already because of you. Now hold on, you're getting valuable experience. Wednesday at the very latest, I promise. It's the second time you've done this, Olivia. It's almost impossible for me to measure an area this size on my own. I'll be there. Well, I better get back to it, unless you want me to be even later. Right. Bye. Bye. So how do you like your lodgings? Yeah, fine, peaceful. Settled in okay? Yeah, thanks. Listen, about the wood. Why have you requested state department ordinance of the area? We want to keep things quiet for now. Commercial sensitivity and all that. I need to ask you something else, and I'd appreciate a direct answer. Fire away. You do own the land, right? Of course. Some hopeless development was planned at the tail end of the boom. We got it for a song. It's perfect, or at least it seems to be. It's your job to tell us that for certain. I'm not sure you're gonna get clearance from the EPA. They won't be a problem. How can you be so sure? The system doesn't just protect the environment. It also protects those who wish to exploit the environment. Is everything okay at your end, Mr. Mayberry? Yeah, fine. You're happy to be working with us on this one? Yeah, of course, but... But what? I'm curious why you approached me for the job. I mean, frankly, we both know there are larger survey firms out there better equipped for a project this size. Like I said, it's a commercially sensitive venture. We don't want the competition getting wind of us. If lots of surveyors go trampling around out there, the cat's out of the bag. Besides, Mr. Mayberry. Besides? You have a reputation for discretion. We'll leave it there. Keep me posted. Yeah. For fuck's sake. You're certain? Absolutely, no one knows a thing. This is a curious line of questioning, I must say. I just considered environmental activists or industrial espionage maybe. It's fine. I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. Just someone mucking around. I look forward to getting this concluded. And your man's sittin' over the top of it. What are you having? An IPA. We don't have it. The chemist might, outside. Right. Well, I'll just have a beer, whatever you have. I see you have rooms here. Yeah. Well, are they taken? No. Quiet time of year. Interested yourself? No, I just, well I wondered who'd be staying. Tried to put talk on me? Yeah, I suppose. Where are you staying yourself? I rented a cottage between here and the gully above. And what has you here? Off-season rambler, I'd say. No, I'm working. Workin'? Yeah, well I'm doing a study. A study? It's an academic one, like a thesis really. What about? About the area. What about the area specifically? The gully. Well, the woods in the gully. The woods in the gully specifically. Does that sound specific to you? Not specifically. Sounds more like Devoy's kinda thing. Devoy? That's his cottage you're stayin' in. Went soft in the head wandering through those woods up there doing unspecific things. Yeah, well it's an unspecific kinda place. How do you mean? No one ever named it, never even put it on a map. It's got a name of sorts. And what's that? Gan Ainm. Gan Ainm? No name, it means. Without name, to be precise. How'd you come across his cottage? That was my employer at the university. They took care of that. So how long are you gonna stay in the cottage? I'm not really sure. Hi, mate. Hello, can I get another one of these please? Can I get you something? I stick with the tea. Intoxicate myself in other ways. Yeah, you look like a toker. Do I? Psilocybin, actually. I'll give you a pint of that then. So what is it you do? Oh, whatever I can. You live around here? Yep, a stop just above Gan Ainm actually. You're in the caravan, right? Yeah, I recognize this fella. Chaplin, he's handy. You shouldn't be there, you know. It's all bought up, private property. Private property? Actually, I may have that wrong. I just heard something. How did you hear it? Jesus, I can't remember, to tell you the truth. It doesn't matter anyway. I don't believe in the concept of private property. Yeah, that's 'cause you don't own any. No one does, they just think they do. You always remember to bring the torch with you? I wouldn't wanna get lost, man. There's fairy fields around here, you know? Yeah. They say people don't get out of them. They wander forever around in circles unless... Unless what? They turn their coats inside out, and that tends to do the trick for some reason. Yeah, probably saved his own life. So what was the story with that fellow who used to live in my place? Devoy? They found him in the wood, half-dead from hypothermia. Catotonic, completely gone. He's been in care since. That's unnerving. This is you. Yeah. Drop in when you're up around Gan Ainm, yeah? Might go with you, maybe. Might be able to help. Sure. 'Cause for a man doin' a study, you don't seem to know much about the place. Oh, and Eric, 'round here best to sleep with your pajamas on inside out, yeah? Come on, boy. You annoyed with me? Why do you say that? It's obvious, as you're not talkin'. No, I'm fine. I just got a lot on my mind is all. Is it your family? No, they're fine. I'm glad you're here. I hate being alone. Bullying. Yes. Who's bullying him? No, Justin isn't being bullied. Justin is the bully. Oh. Yes. Alright, put him on to me. He doesn't want to talk to you. Of course he doesn't, put him on to me. He's angry with you. He's angry with me? I did nothing. Exactly. The school want us to go in and talk with them. When? Soon as possible. When are you back? When I'm finished. How predictably vague. Margaret, this is a big job. I can't just drop everything. - Are you alone? - Yeah. I was, Olivia arrived last night, yesterday. You were right the first time. We'll talk about things when you get back. Well... Margaret, wait. What? Nothing. Nothing. It doesn't matter. Whatever. Enjoy the rest of your break, Eric. Come on, Olivia, get out of bed. We're here to work, remember? Come on, Olivia. Sorry. You get them. It's so old. Why are you whispering? It's like a church in here. Eric? Eric? Eric? Where did you go? Eric? It's not funny. Okay, Eric. Eric, where did you go? I'm here. - Don't do that. - What? Playin' hide and seek. Hand me the receiver. I was here. The light in here is weird. I'm not sure that this project could go ahead anyway. The whole area will be... Not our concern, Olivia. We're just here to claim data. Okay, but I'm just sayin' that... It's just we don't need to talk about it. Did you pack everything? Olivia? Olivia? Sorry, I thought we weren't allowed to talk about it. He grew to love having that artificial eye. He used to pop it out and shock people. Really? Yeah, we cousins, he'd refuse to stay with us 'cause he used to leave it on the pillow and all that kinda thing. Oh my God. He even popped it out in front of a teacher at school just to shut her up, and then he got suspended. Actually, that's how he got the nickname. Which was? Ballar. Ballar? Yeah, Ballar of the evil eye. It's a mythological demon. No? Whatever, they'd been told about him in school. I see. This is nice though, isn't it? The general vicinity, I mean. It's remote and splendid. The type of place you always go on about. Yeah, I could get used to it. Your ideal little idyll. Yeah, well that's just me dreaming, isn't it? Yeah, well aren't you meant to make your dreams come true in life? Just stop, Olivia. I have responsibilities. Justin, I can't just walk away. Yeah, your responsibilities, you mentioned them... And what would you understand about it? You don't know, you have your whole life ahead of you. And what is it you think I wanna do with that life? Eric, do you ever think about what I want? Where did you go? Talk to me! Where are you? Eric, what are you doing? Can you hear that? Hear what? There was someone out here. The only person who's out there is you. Come to bed. You're freakin' me out. Hi there in your little bed. You can come out. Better than a doorbell, that fella. Sorry, hi, I'm Olivia. Gus. Visitors, great, come on in for a cup of tea. Nice one for callin' in, man. I wasn't expecting company. You sure you won't have a cup? No, I'm fine. Where'd you get all the stuff, Gus? I've been all over, mate. Mementos, markers from the journey. Have you always traveled? Half my life. Occasionally I stop somewhere for a while, like here. Yeah? Might stay put this time. Someone's been messing around. Messin' around? Yeah, with my equipment and sneaking around the cottage. Yeah, well we don't know if it's the same person. I have a feeling you're asking was it me, lads. Well, it wasn't me. Don't think I have an alibi or anything, but really, ask anyone, I'm not the type. I don't know how I'm gonna convince you. You're just gonna have to take my word for it. Or get the law involved. You do what you need to. Who the hell else could it be? I have no idea. It's got nothin' to do with me though. Alright. What's on the stove, Gus? Me stew. You hungry? Starvin'. Only made enough to last me for a couple of days, but I'd rather lash it out now and have the company. How 'bout yourself, Inspector? Yeah, yeah I'll try some. You're too kind. He was into Kirlian photography, do you know what that is? No. Do you know what auras are? Oh, is that like the glow or somethin'? Around living things, yeah. So with a plant, when you tear a leaf off, the aura changes as if the plant's distressed. What a tree-hugger. Devoy thought the trees might be able to talk. He said the way they swayed in the wind was sign language. When he saw branches silhouetted against the sky, he thought they looked like scribbled letters. He really did think the trees might be able to say something to us. Jesus, okay, that is good. Yeah. No, he was a great advocate of the Earth's own language guide. What? Hallucinogens, magic mushrooms, things like that. Oh, okay, so you tripped with him. Oh, yeah, did I what. I tripped everywhere with Devoy. You see, he was like me in that he was only interested if it comes from the Earth. See, if it comes form the Earth, you know what you're getting. It's not some mongrel batch of God knows what cooked up by God knows who in some lab somewhere. No, it's pure, you know? Straight from God herself. You make it sound like a religious thing or something. No time for religion then? No, not really. Me neither, man, but I'm not adverse to the odd spiritual experience. So you still indulge? Sure. I think it's healthy. Shed the ego now and again, and melt back into the world. Do you have anything here now? I do, yeah. Be fun to have some sort of spiritual kick, wouldn't it, Eric? Come on, we have work in the morning. Work will still be there in the mornin', man. Yeah, but we have to be able to do it. Yeah, well I want some, so. Come on, Olivia. What, it's just a bit of fun. You can always sack me if you want. Eric, you sure? Yeah. Here, start with that. We just cut everything up into salable little slabs. That's what we do. We just measure the land, put boundaries around it, and we tell people where they can go and when they can go there. Jesus, it's so obnoxious. We just read distances and angles. I don't think we can be blamed for what other people do with the data. Listen to Spock. Land surveying, huh? Something planned for here, is there? It's just a survey of the general area for academic records. I reckon we're afraid of the world. I reckon we think it's out to get us, so we have to get it first. I don't know, maybe it is out to get us. Maybe it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy. What do you think? Seriously, what do you think though? We've lost touch with the world, what it is. People are born, they're given birth to, and they're immediately just burdened with culture and class but like what about who they really are underneath all that? Like who am I, you know? Who are you? And who the hell are you? Can you take it easy? Why is there somethin' the matter with what I'm saying? I think I'm comin' up. What? I finished what was in the bag. You finished the bag? Some heap of mushrooms you're eatin' there, man. Really, I thought you took the same? No. You'll be fine. You'll enjoy yourself. That's some heap of mushrooms. Alright, I don't feel great, so... Oi, you're gonna be grand, Eric. It's a nice, clear night. Let's go for a walk. A walk. - Eric. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. That's so impulsive, Eric, wow. Oh God, Olivia, you are way too... What? There. Let's go. Go play. So you can read the trees, then, Olivia? Yeah, I can. What are they sayin'? They're lookin' down on the human race, and they're sayin' what a bunch of arseholes. Yeah, well some people like to live in nature. Other people like to catch it and kill it and put its head on a wall. Yeah, his wife puts his head in a cabinet. Every now and again, she'll open it and she'll slap him across the face. What are you guys talkin' about? Oh nothing, man. Just sucking the country air. What's funny? In today's spotlight, we've got Eric Mayberry, a part-time adulterer and a full-time curmudgeon. How are you feeling today, Eric? Pretty freaked out. Why are you freaked out? I think I'm hallucinating. What do you see? Are you alone? Heard you need the bitch. Just go with it, man. You alright, Eric? You should turn your coat inside out. What's funny? Is that funny? It's funny. It's alright, man, relax. I think I'll head to bed. That's another day's work lost. Are you alright, man? Yeah. I think I'm gonna get goin'. It's been unreal. I'll walk you out. Yeah. Eric. We have no electricity. - Oh, shit. - Yeah, I know. Where is everything? What? Candles, torches, it's gonna get dark. Oh, Jesus, I don't know. Eric, come in here and have a look at these. What is it? Have you found candles? Yep, and all this other weird stuff. Here. This looks cool. Gonna hang these up. Devoy. Come on downstairs. I'm gonna read you a story from your special book. What special book? You know what special book. The Knowledge of Trees by William Devoy. Okay, here. What is the meaning of trees? Plants, vegetation, nature. Is there grammar in all the greenery? Is there syntax in all the spawning? Are leaves linguistic? Is there something worth reading in the scripts of bent trunks and stems, in crooked branches and petals? I know there is. I've come to understand there's a book of nature, and all I have to do is find out how to open it, turn the pages, and read the words. Natural, oh. Natural narcotics help me read the world from my belly to my brain, and bang I see it suddenly with ferocious clarity. Everything is involved in a kind of choreography. Light wind, organic matter, all dance to a silent tune. Everything shines. This is a vibrating, verdant world. This is everything we need. This is what was taken from us. This is Eden. My God, this guy must've had some serious stash. Let's search the place. Anyway, it's mostly just drawings of plants and fungus and stuff. It's pretty crazy, isn't it? I don't know, maybe he was on to something. Maybe he was enlightened. Yeah. Eric. That's almost everything. So listen, you head back to the cottage. I'm gonna go for a wander. I'll walk back later. - Really? - Yeah, just feel like a walk. Right. Hello? Fuck. Jesus, Olivia, you frightened me. Yeah, everything frightens you. How's Gus? What? Well, you took your time. I take it you dropped in on him. Mm hm, yeah I did. He's fine. That's lovely to hear. I can't find the last day's field readings. Have you been using this? No. I can't find the readings. I mean, they're gone. Sorry, I didn't mean to laugh. Just tired, maybe we both are. Are you looking for attention? Is that what this is? What? The way you've been behaving. Making us take mushrooms and things. I didn't make you take anything. Reading from that mad man's book, and hanging his pictures all around the place. Is this some kind of game? What exactly are you accusing me of? Is this all at my expense? I mean, I don't feel like I'm out here to do my job. I don't know what we're supposed to be doing. Did you arrange this with the others? - The others? - Yeah, Olivia. The others, Gus, the locals, or the client. I mean, it just feels like a setup. There's a real vindictive vibe to all this. A vindictive vibe? Yeah, I sense an aura, like in those photographs. What was that stuff with the interrogation? Shining a torch in my face. I mean, are you really that fucking angry with me? I don't want things to change. Things don't have to change. Why is everything changing? I'm really confused about all this, Eric. Just tell me, and we can sort it out. Tell you what? Why are you trying to tear me apart? Olivia, I'm sorry. I don't feel comfortable staying here with you anymore, Eric. Stop, where you gonna go? I don't know, somewhere in the village. I'm not gonna stay here. It's late, this is silly. Just stop. Get out of my way. No, just put your bag down. - Get out of my way, Eric. - Put the bag down. Olivia, put the bag down! Olivia, come on, get in the car. This is crazy. No, you're fucking crazy, Eric! Olivia, I'm sorry. Let's talk about it. Jesus, don't just walk off. Please, I said I was sorry. This is stupid. Ah, shit. Olivia. Stop! Stop! Mr. Mayberry? Mr. Mayberry? Mr. Mayberry, is everything alright? Mr. Mayberry, do you need help? Hey. Hey! Where you goin'? Hey. Hey! Communicate! Eric? Eric, you there? Eric, it's me, are you in there? Eric? Eric! Eric! Eric! Eric! Dad? I'm sorry. Dad! Hey, come on. Let's go back and join the others, okay? Hey, over here! Eric. Here, warm him up. - Eric. - Get an ambulance! Can you hear me? Eric, it's me. - Eric. - Your jacket. Put your jacket on him. Olivia. Did you get someone? Eric.
