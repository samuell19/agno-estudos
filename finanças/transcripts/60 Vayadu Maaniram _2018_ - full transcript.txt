I pay you to take care of my father Call yourself a doctor? - You are being rude unnecessarily - I like that I’ll make sure this ends your career What- Shiva Shiva, please Wait a second You want to apologize, huh? Why should I apologize to you? You didn’t know to take good care of him when you took him out You didn’t know to bring him safe and sound back to our care You didn’t know it was wrong to leave him with our security and not even look back Your father may not be important to you You may have 101 issues with him Every patient is important to us Very important I don’t know if you’ll go to the cops or court Or search for your father It’s your wish We’ll call you when we find him “In a world where men seek God religiously he is searching for a manso anxiously” “In a world where men seek God devotedly he is searching for a managitatedly” “A human being so humane He is looking for that man in vain” “Will he be found in this world I wonder” “Will he be elsewhere I ponder” “Will he be found in this world here?” “Or a totally different world or sphere?” “While searching for his father dear why does he delve within him deeper?” “In the process of this self exploration they forgot their original mission” “One who hoards and locks his wealth wants to add to his millions in stealth” “The millionaire who has amassed as such; he is seeking power, politics and overmuch” “One who has lived life to the fullest wants to climb to the next rung in earnest” “One who has reached the peak of fame wants to achieve more laurels to his name” “To keep seeking has become the name of the game” “Most of the time in a man’s lifespan spent searching as much as he can” “On earth that God almighty descended searching for a kind heart contented” “His wish didn’t come true as intended” “Where is the man care-free living like the wind without a worry?” “Here is a man whose intention is to clamor for attention” "Where are the very few who are kind and true?" "Vengeful hearts you find are the ones left behind" "Saying ‘we have no one' we don’t have anyone" "Since a child every mother gives birth is a gift from God on this earth" “O’ man, stop being tired and weary search for peace on the contrary” That’s God’s sign of glory “In a world where men seek God spiritually he is searching for a man spiritedly” “A human being so humane He is looking for that man in vain” - Hey!

Balu and I want to start a tuition center - So I'm running from pillar to post - Why? Because I spent all my savings building this house After that, you said you wanted to go to the U.S after you graduate Whatever I had saved for you covered your mother’s hospital expense Now your mother is a framed photo and the house is mortgaged! Why all this now? You’re still trying to go abroad Life is beautiful You should have started this long ago Didn’t Devaraj sir ask you then?

Permanent cure hasn’t been found as yet ‘But we can slow down the process with the help of medicines’ ‘That’s all we can do’ He will be frustrated when he loses his memory You shouldn’t send him alone anywhere because he won’t know ...where he is or what he is doing ‘You must take care of him like a child’ Your role is very important You took your tablets? Yes, I did I get this irritation towards the evening It’s called sun- Sun downing I read about it Appa I have some good news - What? - I’ve got a promotion Wow! Congratulations!

You must have been 3 or 3+ then We had gone to the beach It was jam packed You were missing We ran helter-skelter looking for you It took us 1 hour to find you The trauma he went through that 1 hour, I can still remember He cried his heart out and uttered these very same words to me After that, for quite some time …you know, wherever he went he’ll carry you only on his shoulder Did you hear anything? Not till now Shiva, shall we give a police complaint imemdiately? - What, bro? - You change the license plate - I'll be right back - Again...?

What is your crime? Nothing, sir, I tried my hand at organic farming And your men arrested me, sir Organic farming? With great difficulty I used natural manure - And grew a few marijuana plants - Marijuana...? Farmers like me have no protection I'll clobber you! I'll pound you to a pulp, rascal Yes?

My name is Archana Okay...I'm sorry, Archana For what? I was too harsh on you this afternoon It's okay Shiva, you get angry very easily This isn't the time to lose your temper Your dad says this to me often Inside every person- I know, black dog and white dog, right? I've heard it many times Moron! How many times I've told you about her? Lured by her fair skin, huh? Bro, in this country they will guess your caste by the color of your skin! That's why I want to marry her and change my lineage You are beyond redemption! Even in films if you see, bro last week I watched a horror film Heroine was very fair After she dies she haunts as a spirit She's dark skinned then How is that possible? Angels are fair Ghosts are dark Has the director seen a ghost? It isn't like that Fair skinned people are ghosts when alive If dark skinned they are ghosts after they die, that's all Super, bro - Get me water - I didn't know this They've made too many horror films and insulted spirits No one will get spooked even if they see a ghost Even kids find horror films funny instead of cartoons - I want water - Aiyo! Ghost Bro...! Hello? Sir...? Aiyaiyo!

Where did you come from? What to do with those 2 men? 1st find a good hiding place After that kill them both Let's discuss the rest tomorrow morning Okay, sir Dai...stop! Aiyo! Ouch! Janaki...Janu...how did I come here? It all seems like a dream I was wondering if I'll ever see you again Yesterday, 2 killers ...took turns targeting my head I fainted and fell down One of them... ...I dreamt he stabbed me with a knife I want 1 more 'dosa' 'Sambar' is very tasty Your daughter made it? Shiva is busy, he'll be back on Sunday If he likes the girl, we'll finalise this alliance Hello, what do you mean? She's my wife! Thanks, sis Come here What's happening here? Making 'dosa' for them as if they are your family How dare you ask me! Last night I called you at 2:00 a.m Some fellow said 'your husband met with a small accident, nothing serious' He asked me for our address And I told him Oh my dear! What happened to him? - Lock the gate, Shiva - Where's the bedroom? - Which is his room? - Over there What happened? Oh my gawd! Only then I knew they were rowdies! Hand over your phone You shouldn't utter a single word I don't want to hear even a whisper If you think of being over smart I'll kill your whole family Go - Where's that man's phone? - Here, bro Give me your phone Take it out Whom will I call? Then why do you need it?! Go and check on the old man You'll be drunk as a skunk and puke in our hall I'll clean it up because it's my fate! If you bring home thugs what will I do? You're making 'dosas,' right? - Hold your tongue! - Did I bring them? Janu, listen Don't cry I'll somehow convince them to leave What if they still don't go? Make your usual 'sambar' for lunch They'll eat and leave once for all Sir...1 minute My name is Rajappa This is my wife Janaki I work in the sugar factory nearby as the Purchase manager We are a middle class family, sir We borrowed money and paid heavy interest to build this house We are lower middle class now! I don't mind telling you When our PM announced at 8:00 p.m 1000 rupee notes won't be valid anymore... ...I was laughing until 8:30 p.m All I had was only two 100 rupee notes Sir, my wife and son are with me Doesn't speak well if other men also stay here I won't inform anyone Police, CBI Whoever questions me, I'll say that blow to my head made me forget everything [loud hiccup] Water We are in this soup because you asked for water Otherwise we would've buried that body and safely- What does he mean? - Why are you interrogating me? - I'm scared Zip your lips Shiva...? Cut apple for your mother Hey, get up I've been watching you Are you making fun? I'll strangle you What- Did you fall down again, Shiva? It's okay You can't learn to ride a cycle without falling down Amma...? Who are these strange men, ma? He's your grandfather He's your uncle Then who is he? He is- We haven't identified him as yet! Shiva, check if this is okay Shall we add a cash reward? Good idea! Add 1 more line 'cash reward' Take a printout immediately, okay? How do I find my dad in such a big city? Shiva, there's no other choice We must be positive we'll find him and search Doctor, when will John become alright? In 1 week he should be fine Next month we are planning to go to Kashmir John's 50th birthday! Oh! He'll be fine by then - Don't worry - Thanks Say thank you Bye - Both husband and wife have Alzheimer’s? - No...no Only Maria The wheel chair patient isn't even her husband His name is Ramu He's another patient here The man who accompanies her always He's her husband, Johnny Imagine how I felt when it all started Shocked by my answer? Maria doesn't remember her husband Johnny Don't know why But she thinks Ramu is her husband She'll behave like that even in front of him Johnny is a great man Maria doesn't recognise him Even then he'll come daily and spend time with her That's very important, Shiva When I see all this, I feel even more guilty Shiva, nothing wrong about leaving your dad here You washed your hands off, right? That's wrong Very true, Archana Even if this Care centre provides all the comforts... ...I realize the importance of family ties When Maria mentioned about his birthday, I remembered Last year we celebrated your dad's birthday I had mailed you that video too Did you watch it? Maybe you were busy! What are you so deep in thought, Shiva? I was thinking about Maria's journey How long has Mr Ram been here? Around 1 year He has a son He admitted him here, that's it After that he has never showed up We tried persuading him to visit 'I'm sending money Your duty is to take care' “Won’t eyes that sift and sieve see the person they seek intensely?” “Won’t hurried feet running to and fro reach the right place instantly somehow?” “Clouds in pursuit of the sky wander around They shower rain searching for the ground” “Isn’t that a puzzle so profound?” “Eyes that sift and sieve” “Seek to perceive” “Without pursuit life doesn’t exist” "We came to search readily but blind as a bat really" “Like the roots underground relish searching for water to nourish” “We walked across though our paths criss-cross” “In this quest so helpless meeting many a stranger hapless” “Won’t the blowing breeze say so please?” “To a lovely lullaby dainty flowers dance” “Won’t the pleasure of pursuit enhance?” “Won’t the rainbow hues 7 innate shining from heaven be adequate?” “Won’t this quest end on a happy note?” “Won’t eyes that sift and sieve see the person they seek intensely?” “Won’t hurried feet running to and fro reach the right place instantly somehow?” Sir…? - Are you Mr Ram’s son? - Yes Your father is in a bad shape So what? You should visit him now and then Because you don’t his health has deteriorated Why should you be bothered about him? Do you work in that center? No, but my dad is also an inmate It isn’t enough just to send money every month You must visit him often He doesn’t even recognize me What do I gain by seeing him? I’ve taken a loan to admit him in that center What more can I do? I thought the same way too But my father is now missing I’m hunting high and low for him He’s missing Good riddance Just let it be How can you say this? It’s his fate What will you do finding that madcap? Nurturing tonnes of love within The only bond which appears to be a foe is a father I paid a hefty price to get enlightened I told you with good intentions not wanting you to be in my shoes Our lifespan is really short Your father has crossed ¾ that time frame Visit him whenever you can Just half an hour Try sitting with him Then you’ll understand I’m very sorry I hit you Please understand what I’m trying to say ‘Hi, I’m Seenu’ ‘Johnny likes cake’ ‘I have never celebrated my birthday ever since my wife passed away’ ‘I don’t know if I will be in a condition to do so next year’ ‘Why are you getting sentimental? Cut the cake, da’ ‘Seenu, do a good job’ ‘Okay, doctor’ ‘They are going to cut the cake’ ‘Uncle, wait Make a wish and then cut’ 'Okay' '- What did you wish for? - Tell us' 'What will I wish?' 'My son Shiva should-' '- What did you wish for? - Tell us' 'What will I wish?' 'My son Shiva should-' I told you we can buy a small apartment in the city You were so stubborn in wanting an independent house The realtor who sold this plot claimed a school and mall were planned nearby …conveniently vanished into thin air I have to bear the fuel charges of the newspaper man, milkman who deliver Now it has become a guest house for murderers to stay when they are bored My only fear is if they tell all their thug-friends And we have thugs from Rajasthan following their footsteps It’s a namesake independent house But where is the independence? Will they go away if we offer them some money? They don’t look that kind Even your ‘sambar’ couldn’t chase them away! I’m so terrified What if they do something to me? You have high hopes! Grandpa, you shouldn’t color outside this line It doesn’t even look like a horse now Let him keep coloring Shall we play ‘Snakes & ladders’? I misplaced the coins No big deal I’ll find a way Wait, I’ll be back ‘Police officer Sabapathy who was missing has been murdered’ ‘He was found dead in an abandoned tempo in a desolate suburb of Chennai’ ‘The police department is now on a man hunt-‘ Where are you? In a safe place, bro Stay put there till the problem dies down What did you do to those 2 men? I’ll do it…at the right time Are you getting married or what? Is this what I get for having trusted you? The issue has blown out of proportion It’s all over the news How can you be so irresponsible? You’re mistaken, bro Both of them are not connected to this Ranga, we can’t afford to take any risk Tell me if you can’t do I’ll delegate someone else No, bro I’ll do it - Call me once you are done - Okay, bro ‘MISSING Govindharaj, age 60’ Sir, I’m calling from Thiruvanmaiyur Police station You had complained about a missing person We have found a body resembling the photo you gave Can you come up to the mortuary and identify him? Shiva Shiva? Shiva? I’m up here, Archana Shiva, what are you doing with the front door wide ope- I called you You didn’t pick my call I got worried So I came to- I can’t bear this, Archana I have a 300 gm heart like everyone else If it has to carry a load of 500 gm, what will I do? My mom died of cancer My dad has Alzheimer’s What wrong did I do? Why me? I didn’t realize his value when I was with him I haven’t even spoken to him properly Not even called him ‘appa’ fondly He will always ask me ‘Have you eaten?’ I’ve lost my temper so many times Now I don’t even know if he is eating He doesn’t even know to say he’s hungry You are a doctor You would’ve seen many bodies A man lying in a road accident A body preserved in a mortuary If I am asked to identify if this man is my dad? Height of cruelty, Archana In this- In this world In this world only love is very important No use pickling it inside We should know to be demonstrative I swear I don’t know Shiva, please I understand your trauma But this is not the time You have to be strong We have to search for him in many places tomorrow We must search But I have realized this You are looking for a missing person But I have lost a dear one and I’m searching for him It’s alright, bro This is no big deal Hey! He’s wearing my t-shirt He called me ‘akka’ and asked me affectionately - So I gave it to him - Are you his sister? What’s for lunch, akka? Oil cake and fodder! Your husband is very funny Disgusting! But if your father had a son I’m sure he would’ve been like him His face looks like a burnt down hut ‘May you be blessed with 100 springs in 1 lifetime’ - Nothing serious, bro - Shiva, does it hurt too much? I’ll give you a tablet after you’ve eaten Hereafter I’ll be with you when you learn to cycle, son Bro, is this man a mental case or is he pretending to be one? Forgotten everything He lost his way and somehow landed with us I think so too If he had borrowed money all over the place… …his creditors will trace him come what may But if he is the one who lent money and forgot …not a single soul will hunt for him - Show, bro - Enough Just a little bit more I’m almost done, bro Go and check who it is Bro, police Police, huh?! I got a complaint I came here to inquire I’ll handle it, sir Like Guna sir said And escape through the rear entry Don’t hesitate, bro Okay, sir I’ll handle it How long will you take to open the door? - What’s your problem? - Nothing, sir I was in the loo What’s the problem, sir? Day before yesterday, late at night your wife filed a complaint you’re missing When I called back phone was switched off I was patrolling this side So I thought I’ll look in ‘No one is at home’ ‘My wife has gone shopping after dropping our son in school, sir’ My friend hosted a party That’s why I couldn’t pick your call Are you brainless or what? Will you call and disturb us for such trivial issues? ‘Do you think we are jobless?’ ‘Why do you drag us into husband-wife squabbles?’ Sorry, sir You said no one is at home What was that noise? That’s an old fan I bought in OLX It creaks now and then, sir ‘Shiva…?’ ‘Shiva’ ‘Shiva’ Good you came I was the one who called Thilaka is not well Has the ambulance arrived? Who are you? My father-in-law, sir He’s mentally unsound So when my wife goes out she usually locks him inside Uncle, come Sit down and relax Please come Yov! Don’t you know it’s wrong to lock up an elderly person like this? I was feeling a bit unwell I thought I’ll lie down He might wander away leaving the door open, sir Sorry, sir We haven’t done anything unlawful I am a good man at heart Take a look Except Arvind Swami we have all the ‘Swamy’ photos My wife was a little impulsive That’s all, sir I don’t blame you Nowadays there’s no ground rule for calling the police Last week a drunk stood on the phone tower because his wife walked out That too in his briefs, loose! Then it might have come off! I meant our ‘madcap’! Took us 3 hours to bring him down Your wife didn’t know At least you could’ve called her …informed her you’ll be late and you’re with friends, right? Sir, I’m sure you’re worldly wise Generally a wife never thinks high of her husband’s friends How affectionate we are with our wife’s friends They lack that equanimity Okay, fine There was a murder in this area If you have any suspicion, call- Sir, I swear I won’t disturb you I said call us - Sorry, sir - Daft or what? “This very night long ago” I have travelled all over the world I have stayed in all the 5 star hotels But only in this hotel there’s no swimming pool Mr Krishnan This isn’t a hotel Care center There isn’t any swimming pool here What do you mean?

Not yet, sir - We are searching day and night - I'm sure you’ll find him I’ll also pray for him Thank you, sir I want to tell you something I haven’t studied human behavior as much as I've delved into computer and software But only when I meet someone like you I regain my faith in humanity I learnt from you about unconditional love This isn’t such a big feat, Shiva She’s the one who has forgotten everything I haven’t, hmm? Archana, I saw the birthday video you sent me But it was cut half way through What did my dad wish? He said, 'I want to find the right bride for my son when my memory is still intact' He’ll keep harping I should get married And keep sending me photos of prospective brides Didn’t you like any of them? How can I decide looking at a photo? Archana, sorry about last night I think I made you feel really uncomfortable It’s okay Generally I don’t get so drunk But I hope you understand What did you say, Shiva? This…this world Okay This car New car? I need to go looking all around, right? So I borrowed my friend’s car Shiva, 1 minute Your dad drew this When he was new here he said he would sketch me Still incomplete Archana, what’s happened to Mr Ramu He was gasping for breath last night We’ve admitted him in the hospital But something surprising happened His son came and hasn’t left his bedside It’s like a miracle I just can’t believe it Good evening, sir Hello, sir Please take a seat Sit down, madam What would you like to drink? Tea…coffee? - We are fine, sir - Then juice it is Hey! 2 glasses of cool juice I've been getting calls from a minister and IAS officers from last evening Regarding what, sir? Everything to do with your father Sir, I didn’t tell anyone I don’t know anyone in that level No…no, they are his old students They are placed well in society now They used their clout Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp The buzz was instant all over the net Infact it’s trending online today That’s why I’ve asked all my men to patrol all the areas Every single road We’ll somehow find your father, sir Hell-o Yes, sir! Is that so, sir? I’m dealing with it right now, sir I’ll get my full force into this, sir We’ll find him, sir Yes, sir Okay, sir Commissioner I believe even he is your father’s old student Oh! Quite possible Actually the moment you complained From that second onwards we are dealing only with your father’s case I haven‘t gone home for the past 48 hours My wife yelled at me But work is worship, right? Duty is important, huh? Thank you - Thank you, sir - No mention The reason I called you is Suppose someone enquires about this case to you …I’ll appreciate it if you tell them we are dealing with it diligently Sure, sir Thank you so much By the way my name is Thangaraj We’ll take leave then I swear he'll bring the juice for you It’s okay, sir Thanks Okay You can call me anytime, sir Thank you, sir Thank you, sir 2 juice cancelled, cool My dad has forgotten everything But he lives in so many hearts! Hello? ‘Sir, the man in the Missing poster is with me now’ Is that so? Yes, sir ‘Yes, how much is your cash reward?' Money isn’t a problem Where did you find him? ‘Bring 0.1 million and come to the venue I ask you to’ That’s okay, sir How is he now? - ‘He is with me for the past 1 week’ - IDIOT! Sir, did you call me? Thangaraj! He’s missing for just 2 days If I get hold of you- Trying to swindle a man who is traumatized Do you have any compassion? - Hello…hello? - Shiva, please We’ve mentioned ‘cash reward’ This is bound to happen Such fellows- Is he human at all? I got a call like this yesterday He showed a lot of concern Then he said, ‘You have a lovely voice You must look beautiful too’ - And asked me out for coffee - What did you reply? ‘Your voice is lousy You must be awful looking’ ‘I am not interested' I said and asked him to hang up Scumbags! Shiva, please You have a lovely voice You look beautiful too Will you have a cup of coffee with me? Shiva, all of us have a black dog and a white dog inside us Love, compassion, kindness are virtues of the white dog Lies, rage, robbery, revenge are vices of the black dog These 2 dogs will always be competing and fighting inside us Do you know which dog will win? Tell me, grandpa Which dog will win? Tell me, grandpa He forgot We can perform a simple temple wedding Then invite our guests for a get-together He thinks you’re the bride By all means, sir If you let me know the date I’ll bring her myself I can even play the trumpet Will you stop it? - Correct - Aiyo! I haven’t gone to work for the past 3 days I haven’t even asked leave of absence If you give my phone I can report sick You can’t call now Wait till bro nods an okay You shut up, ungrateful oaf! - Who is ungrateful? - You You hit me on my head when I called the ambulance Don’t trust him He will let you down Don’t shoot off your mouth - What the hell? - How dare you deride me If you’re so grateful sit in a corner, wag your tail ‘You don’t know me’ You can't even scare a child ‘But you’re scared, right?’ I'm sparing you for my sister’s sake When did my wife become your sister? What is your father’s name? Your mother’s name? Tell me, I say Tell me What’s the issue now? You keep quiet Don’t trust him, sir He thrust a knife on my nec- Akka, I think he’s a Hindi master! That’s Math, you moron When our house was being built ...dad sold mom's jewelry as we were short of cash He was so worried That's why he painted her like this Wow...it's a nice one My dad din't draw this Someone else did - Who? - His name is Shiva! Really? Only useful skill I learnt from my dad When I was a kid ...I got so fed up of drawing on paper I didn't spare a single wall My mom gave me one hard blow on my back My dad said, 'why have you left this wall empty?' Both of us painted this My parents got into a world war after that! But my dad kept quiet and retired to his room Amma didn't give up She told my dad 'I married you because you fell in love with me, I didn't love you' I thought a volcano would erupt! Then? My dad coolly replied, '1 person's love is enough for a marriage to work' 'If both fall in love it will only lead to fights' This is exactly how my amma laughed too! When he was new at our center I used to talk a lot to him He used to share a slice of his life with me That too his love story Wow! I would ask him to repeat it Love story? Yes, his love story Oh! What, Shiva? I knew he fell in love but- He has never told me his love story even once I remember asking him once To which he said Tell me when you fall in love I'll tell you then This was his reply Oh! Do you know how he'll begin his story every time I asked? A man and a woman When they look at each other with true love At that very moment God plants a seed for an entire generation When you appa met your amma he was a final year student Your mom had just joined, 1st year My Thilaka was not a head turner But in my eyes She was Miss World! She was very reserved by nature And flash a special smile once in a while Wow...interesting! - Then? - I had to travel ...only to 2 km to reach my college But she had to start from Guindy 12 km So sad I'll start early in the morning Go to Guindy, wait at the bus stop I'll travel with her Do you know where their bus-love progressed to the next level? - Canteen, huh? - Wrong Library Naturally it would've been deserted Your mom made a beeline to the library when she was free I started reading books only because of her The more I read I was hopelessly in love Hoping to talk to her atleast before I graduated One day I went and stood in front of her She looked up at me Without blinking an eye I froze like a statue made of snow My love was reflected in her eyes too Ap...appa has been so perseverant, huh? I just can't believe it By the way on tat day did he profess his love? No, he couldn't muster up courage So he went back home 'Then I graduated' 'I joined as a post-grad student in the same college just for her' 3 years just whizzed past Aiyaiyo! My course was about to end Can't delay it any longer What should I do? What? Letter! Letter...letter Letter Yes, I wrote a letter - 4 pages - 4 I wrote 4 pages to her - Where is Thilaka? - Where? Thilaka? In her aunt's house She was staying with her mother's sister I cycled straight to her house with the letter in my pocket It was pouring cats and dogs I went and stood there drenched to my skin After a long, long time... Thilaka came out I walked up to her with the letter in my hand In her... I dropped the letter in her mail box Then? She read the letter She was totally disappointed - Why? - Why? - Why? - Because ...After standing in the rain for so long ...his letter was wet with ink smudged on the paper Aiyaiyo! - Now villain entry - Who was that? After that Every day I'll cycle To the road where she lived I'll see her She'll see me Both of us never noticed her aunt was watching us Sometime later I went there one day Her house was locked I went 2 days continuously But Thilaka wasn't there Not knowing Not knowing what to do I felt I had gone mad Then? Your friend Friend Her friend came to see me She handed over...a letter A letter Thilaka wrote to me 'I am going to my hometown' She said her father was unwell She signed it Your Thilaka Your Thilaka Imagine my joy Your Thilaka...! I don't know how many times I read those 2 words I couldn't wait any longer I took a bus to her hometown Went straight to her house Only then I knew They had tricked her and she was to marry someone else My heart broke and my world just collapsed I wept inconsolably and reached the bus stand I was about to board the bus I remembered the words 'Your Thilaka' I felt I was making a grave blunder If it is true love... I decided I should fight for it till my last breath I don't know from where I got that kind of courage I walked into her house again They beat me to a pulp They dragged me but I went upto Thilaka and stood before her Thilaka saw me Thilaka! 'Will you marry me?' I asked her Those were the 1st words I spoke to her With tears streaming down her cheeks Thilaka came and held my hand I held her hands tight and dragged her away from them Your Thilaka Then? Doesn't matter, Shiva Isn't this a beautiful love story? Like strangers in a train who share the same compartment And travel together I stayed under the same roof and didn't really know my parents I'm too ashamed to even think of it All these days, I thought my dad led a rather boring life But he has led quite an adventurous life Thanks, Archana Thanks to you, I found my dad in my heart again I feel like seeing him atleast once more 'A man and woman...' 'When they look at each other with true love' 'At that very moment' 'God plants a seed for an entire generation' It's getting late, see you If you feel like drinking... ...make yourself another cup of coffee - Ranga, is it over? - Not yet, bro - Are you playing the fool? - Bro There's a temple festival nearby - The coast is not clear - Ranga I liked your sense of gratitude and self confidence Retrospect on your life 5 years ago and how I've nourished you Bro, when have I disobeyed you? Only that faith is making me call you I wanted to tell you That boy Kasi who's with you Kill him too - Bro, he is our boy - Do what I say Ranga! We should leave no clues in a crime scene He disobeyed that rule Our life is at stake if we spare him He trusted me and came, bro Wrong timing for sentiments, Ranga If we have to be comfortably well off ...we must kill anyone who is an obstacle, got it? Don't lose me by supporting a boy who walked in yesterday Nothing of that sort, bro Let me ask you one last time Can you do this or not? Okay, bro I'll handle it In you go! Bro...? Shiva, do you know which dog will win? The dog which you feed and raise with love will win [Holy chant] 'Uncle, wait' 'Make a wish and then cut' 'Okay' '- What did you wish for? - Tell us' 'What will I wish?' 'My son Shiva should' '...get married before my memory fades' 'With a girl like Archana' 'Why 'like Archana'? Let's ask her' 'Uncle!' '- Cut the cake' - Okay' 'Happy Birthday' - Hello - I killed everyone, bro Good, how did you dispose the bodies? That is...my problem, bro Job neatly done Where are you? I am...er- - Near Orapakkam railway station - Stay there, be safe I'll call you, after making some other arrangements Go to Mumbai and stay till all the issues settle here - I'll take care of all your needs - Okay, bro Ranga has cleared the hurdles So only Ranga is alive Let's close his chapter too Guna, whatever you told Ranga the same holds good here This is not the time for sentiments The police department is head deep involved in this case That's why I'm insisting Only if the killer is alive will a finger point to the man who ordered the killing Brother, how could you do this to me? Sir, you killed the hand that helped you Will you eat? [overlap of indistinct voices] 'I went to ensure you got medical aid' 'If you had let me go I would have' 'I am just a normal man' 'I haven't repaid my home loan' 'I didn't do anything wrong' 'Why did you do this to my family?' 'Shall I serve you sambar?' Yaaay! I got 3 'Going up the ladder? Wait, I'll get you' Shucks! Rajappa Let's go for a walk God help me Yes - Hello - Madhavi, this is Kasi Kasi...? Hello...? Hello?
