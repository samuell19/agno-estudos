In the year 1861... the plains and mountains of the West... ... don't seem to be affected by the Civil War, not yet, in its first months of battles... it still felt like a distant echo. Only a little attention was paid to the news of the great battles, ... who brought the telegraph, ... which grows in the west a few kilometers a day. ... these messages remain on the coast... ... thanks to the young pilots of Pony Express. news of victories and defeats... they spark conversations... to the heat of the fire in lonely villages and farms. Then, with sudden fury, the West fell victim to the guerrillas. Lawless gangs destroy everything in their path, invading and looting the warehouses on the border, They attack federal fuel cars... riding under the flag of pirates, and under the orders of the famous bandit... Wade McQuarrie. Whose name is the meaning of terror. McQuarrie, a bloody butcher, that seemed to be everywhere and nowhere. a man feared that revenge so much... immediately fell on anyone...... that he was suspected of going with him .. Hold on. If my men were here, I... Doc, thanks McQuarrie, ... you hid and healed two of your wounded men. I didn't dare expel them, they were threatening my family... You lie, you think we wouldn't find out. Hurry! Go fast! They will hang Dr. Seddon. Let's go... Untie him, Mitchell. He allied himself with the southern rebels. Can anyone prove it? Do not move! Stay here, Miss. Seddon. General McClellan was rejected! The North is in retreat! They will realize that the war is going to be a long one. Yes, and I have proof. It is true that the feds were defeated. It's in the headlines. "Abe Lincoln asks for more volunteers." Well, this is your chance. Who wants to fight... Sergeant Ici will get your enlistment signatures. Okay, I have the sheet here. What about you? Can't wait to hang up? I didn't see you sign. Autry is an army scout, that's enough. I can be a scout, Major. You can put me on the list, sergeant. Okay, guys, go ahead, Ici. I want all subscriptions. Let's go... Gene, you are not going to get rid of me easily. If you join them, I will too. Major, wait until you have to sign, It is worth returning my whip. Excuse me. Here, Joe. You will have to hire another guy. You're a tough guy, Pat. There are not many guys who know how to do this. You don't think I know. Why do you think I keep using this rabbit's foot? I drove... in the rain and storms... Down all those rocky mountain roads I encouraged the horses with this trumpet... when it was so cold that the harness is frozen. I was chased by the Indians, attacked by bandits, ... and all I have to say is... any man who wants to leave this profession... joining the army is a coward. Okay, guys, hurry up! Hurry before the war is over. The major would like to speak with you, Gene. Thank you. Gene, there are many ways to serve your country, and some more productive... ... than an entire military company. Are you talking about escorting stagecoaches? I wasn't thinking about it. Surely you must know the region... where the McQuarrie gang operates. It's great territory, Major. Maybe, but they are there and they are stealing our supplies. At the moment, these bandits are scattered everywhere, and the only way to stop them is to capture McQuarrie. He has friends. They'll know what I'm looking for. I know. That's why you won't tell anyone about your mission. Sorry, Major. I prefer to participate in battles. Gene, before deciding, Let me tell you something, It is important to die for your country, But there is a more important job to serve you. Well, wait a minute. Won't the army care if I keep my rabbit's foot? You can, if that brings you luck. Ok, until next time. You won't need that cloth, Gene. The army will provide the equipment. I didn't sign anything. Yes, the sergeant says that we... Can repeat? I am not enlisting. Do you think I would sign if I knew? Too late for that .. Gene... See you later. Gene, uh... You can't talk like that. Hey you! Form lines! Sorry, I changed my mind. I told you to get in line! You joined the army for three years. But I... Get away or I'll shoot you for desertion. Funny! Go ahead, march! You will see. The war will be short! Are you looking for someone? Not so strong! Do you want the army to find me? I see you found a cyclone. The sergeant said that if I go... He's going to shoot me. Well, I don't want any deserters with me. Take off this camouflage before you walk. Okay, but please, let me go with you. I travel alone. Gene, I don't understand you. Have we always been friends? You never let me down when you were in trouble. Do not move. Want to tell me something? Anything. The McQuarrie gang is preparing for yet another attack... A federal supply train. These cars carried silver secretly... of the Comstock Lode mines. Silver that Washington needs a lot. A small reward for the famous... and the fearsome guerrilla Wade McQuarrie. Gentlemen! In a circle! They say it's behind that hill. I hope the sergeant is not there. Hartley, go out with the silver wagon. It's the car, I saw it in the city. Well, Mr. Wyatt? Do you think you can stop them? I can do it. Take two men with you just in case. The safe is behind the seat. I saw him move. Leave it and help me. How are we going to do that, if we can't even move it? Hang your rope on this branch. With that weight, the horse will hurt. It won't be long, let's go! The army, I don't care. Come back here!! Pat, give me the canteen. McQuarrie... Let's get out of here! They're gone. Is the money still here? Did they take the money? I think so. Take good care, it's worth seeing where they went. The army will return, they will arrest me for desertion. How do you expect them to know? I'm sorry, I am not a quitter. I hope you lie as well as I do. It's just a band... of thieves and murderers. I prefer to find Apaches... on the path of war. Are you with McQuarrie? Who do I? I take care of your friend... I do not wanna hurt you. Most of our equipment is destroyed. They took the money, didn't they? It's not in the car, I already looked. We will take this cart to the wounded. We will need help before we go after those guerrillas. We will track them for you, me and my friend. Are you sure you're not part of their band? Of course, I'm sure of that. Seriously? Yes, really! Well, I'm going to have to take your word for it. Help me to raise it. in the car, guys. What is happening? That's the phrase that woke me up. I'm afraid donkeys will fall off the cliff. Did you meet a pilot on the way? No, I didn't see anyone. I'm laughing because I'm falling asleep in my saddle. My eyes may be closed, but my ears are open. Did you hear the shots? Very safe. But I have a rule. I only deal with my own problems. I'm sorry to have bothered you. No problem. He needed a little company. Forward! One of these days, maybe. Go ahead, Ella! You are as lazy as I am. Unload the donkey. There is something to be proud of. General Lee will thank us. I hope you remember the commission I asked you for. I'm sure it is, Colonel. I hope it stops bothering us. Still here. Walt! What do you need, Ici? Should we change the horses? Do not. Why aren't you in town? What will happen to Daddy? Dell, I'm taking your horse. I don't know what you've been up to, but it's easy to guess. I'm going to have to kill you one of these days, Walt Middler. If you see someone tell him that your horse is running away. What do you want this horse for? He's hurt. I wonder who was riding him. Me. Well, I doubt that you have been harmed by your weight .. We fall. Get ready! This is the best. It won't do any good to continue like this. How many kilometers is the Gateway? 15 kilometers. We will be lucky if we arrive before dark. What are you doing? I have no intention of going there. Will I have to walk? You understand quickly. Now the harness .. My friend, I am afraid we will hand you over to the wolves. You will find your way home. I would also make a very good meal. I forgot you I don't think I can walk much. Wait! What is happening? Are you afraid of being eaten by wolves? I could get lost. And yet you don't want to go up to two? It's ok. If I were you, I wouldnâ€™t try anymore. Do not worry I understand. Leave me there. It is quiet for a small town. Most of the soldiers are gone. Gene, my rabbit's foot brought me luck again. I found it on the road. It can be useful for us. It is the rope that raised the safe. There is still the brand. I thought so too. We just have to find the saddle owner. Poppalardo! Hi! You thought he was dead, right? A long time without seeing you, huh? I'm going to get off my donkey and show how to wake up a village. He's missing a donkey. I saw them on the bridge. I'm used to telling everything I see. The saddle is gone. They were stolen from McQuarrie's friends by Ici. Your teacher is very thirsty. I will talk to him about work, Hey, see if you can find a hotel room. I will find a bed with a large feather bed. Hello Friend. Do you know where I can find the manager of this place? It's me. Do you want a room? Yes, but I realize I could... bring me bad luck. Oh! How can a room bring bad luck? You will know if you find a corpse in one of them! Clean sheets, maid service, ... and also wants a four-leaf clover. They call themselves "Guerrilleros", But I would call them bandits! Assassins, thieves, bandits. Every time we leave, they attack us... at this rate, my regiment will be decimated! How do you expect me to fight McQuarrie? Bare hands ?! Take them to the barracks, we will take care of them. Goes into! OK, what happened? It's about attacking your men, Colonel. Forward! This is my son Walter. runs Overland's local internship office. I stayed at the end where the attack took place. I followed the trail of the bandits. Walt! Walt, you can use this. Hey, does my family bother you? You can talk, it's my daughter Dell. - We have already met. - Seriously? It is not the first time I have been told this. All the men I see say the same thing. Okay, Dell, get the hot water. Now, if you have any ideas, please let us know. There is nothing concrete, it is an intuition. An intuition! We are talking about war and he is talking about intuitions! Just a moment. The colonel had to ask... What are you doing here? I travel to buy horses. But I still couldn't find it. It seems to me that you have come to the wrong place. I'm starting to notice I think you will come back. Maybe not. I don't give up so easily. We look for horses that we don't need, Thinking about it made me seal it in the wrong place. However, my story looks good, doesn't it? Okay, but where are we going now? On the ranch on the Pony Express stage... called a double circle "D". Double circle "D"! A simple '' D '' circle is not enough for you, You need two of them. Lucas. I can't just... Look! I am very lucky for them. I killed this rabbit in a cemetery... on the full moon! It was supposed to be a full moon. The Pony Express! Stop him before he notifies the army. Pat! By horse! Wyatt! Look at this! General Lee denounces the guerrillas. He asks McQuarrie to find out. Gentlemen, This order from General Lee... ... refuses to recognize me as an officer... and me, as part of your army. I wouldn't say... I am not disappointed. They called us bandits... which means greater risks and more enemies... but as bandits... we will continue our operations. If any of you want to go home, you must do this now. It is not good, for the rest of you, I promise you the most daring move we've ever made. Dangerous? Yes... But that will make the South succeed... ... of the strength he may have had for this war. Can I send a telegram to Fort Lawson? Of course. In one month, we gained 10 km of wire. Colonel Mlddler. Request cavalry troops. It will be a pleasure. Considering the damage McQuarrie has done to this place... I didn't know the colonel was giving you a message. He didn't have to. You're going to unlucky us by telling lies. I have a gift for the colonel, a new foal. Next time, I will bring you a nice gift. Do not bother yourself. I don't care, your brother is my friend. Yes I know You don't seem to buy many horses. I prefer to be sure before buying. Yes, me too. You dug your own grave. Good thinking. What did you bring in your packages? Jack laughs? Why don't you ask him? It is not necessary, I know. Weapons and ammunition. This is not a good thing, Walt. Dad is a soldier, he is responsible. We are not the first family to take sides in the war. You and my father believe in one cause, I believe in another. But I guarantee I don't deal with guns or ammunition. I can hardly believe it. You expected something from that trader and his donkeys. Expect that? Do not know. I have no idea. It's cavalry, Gene. See the brand. It's the ranch that was attacked! Let's take a look. It was time for the troop to stop. Colonel Middle? Pass. Captain Fleming, 17th Missouri, on special duty. Nice to meet you, Captain. This is my daughter, Dell. Nice to meet you, it's an unusual name. I hope he's here to pick up McQuarrie. Those are the orders, Colonel, take him and hang him! Blen. Let's have a brandy. I don't know why the Joint Chiefs of Staff didn't call me. I was at the fort with Lee. I know your strategy. I can predict your every move. Water, captain? We are not going to spoil the cognac, Colonel. Excuse me, Miss. Dell. Another, double circle "D". Whoever killed the patrolman stole those horses. Perhaps he had given them to her before. We will find out soon. Luckily Look at this. I tell you the McQuarrie boys They broke into that ranch and stole the horses. What's that McQuarrie thing? He said if McQuarrie showed up, I could steal those horses. Therefore, we will not have to look for it. You must be the luckiest man in the world! What are you looking at? This hole next to your heart. Anyone they hit on that site... It will be almost two meters below the ground, counting the roots. Are they bothering you, sergeant? These are the men who sold us the stolen horses. You finally got them. Yes. It's going down! Thank you. Well, try to see! Get out of there, you idiot! Come on, one more! Another. Seven years of bad luck. And this is the time you are going to spend in prison. Sergeant! Gene, we have company. Calm down, Pat. Open up, sergeant. The colonel has some doubts, so let's ask some questions. Yes sir! You said you're an overland stagecoach driver But nobody at the base seems to know you It's normal, my path goes in the opposite direction, to california And you say you're a military scout. You can try, I think. Colonel, you don't know about these men. They have horses marked with a double "D" circle. stolen by guerrillas. This ranch sold many horses. I just ask you to take a look. Instead, I ask that you verify your identity. He was stationed at Fort Aldridge, correct? Yes, sir, with Major Weatherly. We have a man who just left there. You have to enter. Dr. Seddon! - Do you know them, doctor? - Yes. Do you see, Colonel? They are in Fort Aldridge, They are wanted by deserters! You are lying, Colonel. They tried to hang him for helping McQuarrie. This is good, good good. If I were you, Colonel, I would prefer to believe the doctor. Men tend to make up stories... ... when they are at risk of being hanged. That's it, captain. Colonel? You have to take a look. You have the telegraph, find out who they are. How ungrateful this doctor is. We saved you from the gallows! Captain, I will let you organize the firing squad. Yes sir. Bunny, if you can help it... Now is the time to do it. Dr. Seddon! I can't speak the truth They would have killed us all. Take it inside. give me a hand Okay, it's over. Where did I put the weapons I took from the two prisoners? Do not ask me. If there is any question about this Captain Fleming .., Why not telegraph to taste? I can still recognize an officer when I see one. Take care of the house... ... and I from field operations. Yes father. Headquarters, USA Army Washington. Cpt. Fleming Information from the 17th Missouri Cavalry, about your mission... Walter. Was your diligence from the East? It will arrive any moment, you will see. Well, ask them to leave it on the telegraph. I'll give it to the driver. Your weapons. Under the summary. What is happening? They are going there. Come on! This way! Inside home! This way! Go to the stable's back door. Thank you, Dell. A black cat. If you shoot, you will have a misfortune. Captain, the prisoners have escaped! We will find them! Mlddler, come with me. Get ready! Dell, stay here! Try to stop me! Up there! I think we had the same idea. Yes, and I hope it works. Can you find the nearest armed post? - What's the message? - Information about Captain Fleming. 17th Mlssourl Cavalry. 17th Missouri? There was never one! Tell them to send troops. I cannot reach them. The line was cut. Eastern stagecoach! The driver will bring me back and I will let my father know. You don't want to go back. Works for my brother. Sam, Sam, take me back to the station! In between. Both. We return to the starting point. I'm sorry about the gun. But I heard that there is a guerrilla war. We will be safer. I sell goods, I sell donkeys. This time, I will return with honors. Hello, driver there. He doesn't turn around. We took another path, the bridge collapsed. They are coming? We will take care of them. Sam, stop the stage! Okay, Sam, stop there. Your weapon. They are going there. McQuarrie will be furious if we don't find them. Who told you to speak to the driver? Don't worry, we will take you back. Well, captain? Are you coming home empty-handed? Unfortunately I want you to know that no prisoners have escaped me. It is an honor for you, Colonel. Only my men don't have the same weapon as yours. Yes, we don't see many today. A gift from a merchant. These pistols have a thousand ways to fire. - Mind, sl... - Go ahead. It's magnificent. - It is true. - I would like to have. I'll have the gun, Colonel. - What does this means? - I'm taking over. - Give me that gun! - Give it to him, captain. We're leaving this place. Federal troops may have been alerted. All of you on the street! All of you on the street! Let's find out exactly what this guerrilla is up to... Brutal murders in cold blood. McQuarrie and his men reveal these inhabitants... the impotence of these border posts. Without warning, the protective troops turn into looters. Murderers They attack residents who applauded their arrival. The attack is planned in a solemn and methodical manner. some shops, banks and buildings are looted, the others are destroyed. Come on, faster than that! Gene, did you see the smoke? It's the Gateway, they are looting. And we can't help it. We can only wait and watch. McQuarrie said he would not touch the office. These are not the orders he gave us. The cavalry is coming. OK folks! Get ready! Get ready! Dad. McQuarrie. McQuarrie, you... You gave me your word. Gene, I'll go with you. I can show you where they went. Hurry, guys, put it all inside. We'll split up for a few days. This will give you more clues to follow. Take it inside. Gene, do you know what day it is? It must be Friday the 13th. All in! Yes, inside, guys! Block the entrance. Bring more ammo. McQuarrie! Yes, we are Friday the 13th, especially for McQuarrie.
