Let's save people from ruin Try and unite two estranged hearts Go for your goal merrily Try and unite two estranged hearts - Who are you? - Wrong question. It's a tall, broad, young man. Can't you see? - What's your name? - The name's Laat Saab (Big Boss). Are you blind? Can't you see it's a curfew? All bosses are blind. Don't you know that? - You seem to be a decent man. - You think I'm like you? Get lost. - Where do I go? - Home. - Home? I'm homeless. - Go to hell. Let's go to hell then. It'll be fun together. You know, men of your ilk are out on the roads tonight. - What if I'm waylaid again? - Where's your house? Bosses live where they like. In India, I stay where I like. - Go away. - Where do I go? Go away! Hurry. Sister, I can't sleep, I'm hungry. Prakash, it's very late in the night. Where do I get food for you now? Will I starve tonight too? Adversity puts us to the test, Prakash. After father passed away... we've been at the receiving end. Are we the only ones God puts to test? Why doesn't God put those millionaires to test? - Why does He take it out on the poor? - No... don't say that, Prakash. Even I'm hungry. As you know... everything in the house is pawned. They'll be taken away tomorrow. We'll be left... with father's only memento, a ring. Sell it off to aunt tomorrow. Lady, you can't hear me. But I shall get you bread, somehow. Even if I have to go to jail. Get up. Up! Hurry up. - So it's you. - Yes. - You're trapped, sonny. - Can't help it. I failed. - Come on! To the police station. - I know. Let me give this bread to the needy. Else, two hungry people won't sleep tonight. - Are you the city's messiah? - No, constable. - You know the name is Big Boss. - C'mon! - Constable... - Go on, quick. - Here you are. - Who are you? Laat Saab. I have no time, the regiment is waiting for me. Take it. How do you know we're hungry? I know, because I'm also poor. Take it. No. Thank you, but I can't accept it. Quandary did me in. Same with you. - Please take it. - C'mon. The State provides me bodyguards. Bye. Who the hell? What's your name? - Nice tone to start a conversation. - Shut up. - Tone, my foot! - Oh, you talk so sweet. Inspector, just imagine... if I were in your shoes and you in mine... and I'm yelling at you, how would you feel? I see. - What's your name, sir? - That's more like it. I have a name, but they call me Laat Saab. - What do you do, sir? - Need you ask? - I nurture people like you. - Damn you! The two of you are witness. - He is committing a grave crime. - What crime? I broke the curfew, he'll break my skull. Get in, smartass. No. Can one fall in love with me... at first sight? First sight? Just a glimpse, and he won't forget you all his life. Naughty boy. He's right. God made me beautiful. All girls have that misconception, sister. Just you wait! - My hand! - Let go of my ear! - My hand! - Let go of my ear first. Let it go! How can you be so heartless? Her father died just recently. - How can I evict her? - Unless she vacates the house... we won't pay rent. We won't let such a girl live here. No way! Done. Have patience. I've exchanged glances with a stranger My heart skips a beat. Am I falling in love? I've exchanged glances with a stranger When I woke up today... I felt as if something struck my heart I've exchanged glances with a stranger My heart skips a beat. Am I falling in love? I've exchanged glances with a stranger The stranger was so brave He stole my heart away He stole my heart away right under my nose My heart skips a beat. Am I falling in love? I've exchanged glances with a stranger Twenty... and thirty. Be careful. - It's you! - I need to talk to you. Please come in. Be seated. - Tell me. - I don't say that you are bad. But it's bad for a young girl to stay alone. - Any complaints? - God knows if it's true. I hear that at nights... a loafer comes... forget it. Aunt, you are doing well. - Where do you keep the money? - Why? Just asking. If you tell me before you die... I'll give you a proper funeral. So you are waiting for me to die! Just you wait! I can't anger the other tenants for your sake. Besides, you haven't paid me for the last three months. I'll pay you the entire amount once Prakash returns. Rich people drive blindly! They mowed him down. Prakash! Prakash! You think you are human beings? If you can't help others... - at least don't condemn them! - One must condemn the bad ones. I saw it myself. A loafer was talking to her that night. - Then the cops took him away. - I know her. She isn't that type. You folks are cruel. When her father was alive, none of you dared taunt her. Why argue? We'll live with our own opinions. Hardly matters. You folks kicked her out finally. Her brother was mowed down by a car. Not one soul went to mourn. What do you want? Cabbage and tomato. Prince... Aliens! - Gotcha! What's your problem now? - There's a problem. Let me go. Prince! - We're tired of looking for you. - Really? - Don't you have other work to do? - Your mother writes every day. She wants you back home. Where do you wander? - Tell him. - In hell. What are you saying? He belongs to a rich family. His actions speak otherwise. - Prince, where have you been living? - If only I had a home. All the houses in the city belong to me, so do the streets. I sleep where I want to, I wander where I want to. - Who the hell are you? - I'm his manager. He isn't a manager, constable. He is a con man. I see. - Come on! - No, wait! Prince... This isn't fair. I've been looking for you like crazy. And I was looking for you like crazy. - Come on. - Take him away. Prince, your mother is seriously ill. Your mother is seriously ill. Take it. You too... take it. It's you! Have some. - It won't fill your stomach though. - No, thanks. You're being formal again. The next station is six hours away. Have some. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I couldn't help you much. I'm ashamed too, you were maligned because of me. Well, you know how I spent the night at the lockup? Handkerchief. Wipe your tears. You're being too much. If you cry, God will punish the entire world. Every teardrop of yours is like a bomb. Wipe your tears, please. Porter! - May I say something? - Go ahead. - Or should I shut up? - Tell me. - May I? - Say what you have to. Actually... Well, let alone me, even the most courageous ones get nervous. - Then stay quiet. - That's the problem. I can't stay quiet, nor can I speak out. I'd rather write it there. 'I love you. I hope you won't forget me'. Did you read? No. Please write an answer. I'm illiterate. I can't read or write. It's a question of my life, and you are joking. Please write. Turn around. Don't look here until I finish. Fine. - Not fair. - All right, write. I forgot your name. What style. You remember it, though. Laat Saab. 'I hope you won't forget me'. Don't forget this rendezvous, this journey Now that you have stolen my heart, don't forget me My heart has fallen for you Oh, those demure eyes Now that Cupid has struck me, don't forget me Don't forget this rendezvous, this journey With much hope I've surrendered my heart I love you, I desire you Don't forget these eyes full of love Doctor, where am I? - You're in a hospital. - Where's the girl who was with me? There are so many injured girls here. Look for her. - Doctor, I didn't find her. - I can't help it. Search other hospitals. Did you give her the medicines? Get some sweet lime juice. Medicines. I wonder what my son is doing. You worry about him every now and then and you harass me too. We have but one son. You'd rather have had none. What a thing to say. No matter what... - he is our son. - Just imagine. We spent so much on his studies, we pampered him. We pinned our hopes on him, that he'd grow up to be our support. The relationship with children isn't business. Even children have duties towards us. Did we sweat it out... so that he'd give all the money away to the poor? My money is not for him to squander. He can't touch a penny... unless he lives by my rules. If he has the guts... let him work in a mill, let him plough the fields. That's how it'll be, father. I don't need your money. However, don't forget that... you have a duty towards society. The selfish attitude of your ilk has diseased people with poverty. If it is not treated, it'll only grow worse. That's the way it is, and will be. So will be the chaos and atrocities against the poor happen. So will the world be destroyed and made again. I ask, why are you here? The news of mother's sickness drew me here. You can't meet here. Go away. - Son! - Why did you come out? - Son! - The doctor forbids you from walking. Mother... - My son. - Nurse! Summon the doctor, quick. No need to call the doctor. My doctor is with me. Mother... Mother? Son... don't be stubborn. Else, we'll always be unhappy. Drink. Son... I won't live to say much to you. You can never be happy... while your father is unhappy. Apologize to your father... and let me die in peace. Please forgive him, my lord. She was a goddess. With her, our hopes have burnt to ashes. Had she been alive, she'd have changed the face of the village. Do you hear, father? Wealth, property... everything is destructible. But a poor man's blessings... does one good forever. Our attitude killed your mother. I wish we had a reached a sensible decision earlier. Sadly, there was a terrible difference of opinion existing between us. And each one thought the other was wrong. Anyway, I must fulfill her wish. Everything belongs to you now. I've decided to go on a pilgrimage. I hope I'll find peace. Doctor! How are you feeling now? Please let me go. Why don't you let me go? Where do you want to go? We'll drop you there. You don't even remember that. All right, try to tell us your name. My name... My name? You remind me again! I can't remember my name, I've told you! Doctor... I think you are a shaman. You've destroyed my memory. Why did you destroy my memory? Why? For God's sake, destroy the spell! What do you have against me? What do you hold against me? Why did you bring me here? Let me go. - Let me go. - Call for you, doctor. Nurse? - Did you see the loony girl? - No. - Boy! Did you see that girl? - No, sir. Find her before she vanishes. Hurry. The sky has turned green. - Sparkler! - Of course, it'll sparkle. - I've had two doses! - Look behind. - The moon has come down on earth. - Moon? It's the sun. The sun doesn't rise during the day. She's a fairy. Doctor, the guard looked everywhere. But he didn't find her. What do we do now? - It'll bring disrepute to the hospital. - And to you. - You were on duty. - I just went to take a call... and she vanished. Strange girl. - Who was she? - She was tall... royal nose... fair complexion... sensuous eyes... beautiful forehead... melodious voice... musical tone. - Doctor, you're married. - I'm sorry. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Yes? - I'm looking for a girl. - Who is she? - We met with a train accident. God knows who it is. Forty women are dead. Fifty were given first aid and discharged. - No one is in the hospital now? - No. - Can you describe her? - Doctor, no one is in the hospital? Can you describe her? - Describe her? - Yes. Tall... royal nose, fair complexion... sensuous eyes... beautiful forehead... melodious voice... musical tone. - Where is she? - She was... - like someone's musical composition. - Where is she? I'd also like to know that. - Bye. - Bye. How are you feeling? Are you a doctor? No. I'm a philosophy professor at lmperial College. I am Professor Nath. - How did I get here? - I'd like to know that. I don't know how I came here. How did I end up here? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come here. Forgive me. For God's sake, forgive me. What are you doing? Please don't weep. Else, God will destroy the world. Women's teardrops are like atom bombs. Here... wipe your tears. I thought it was my house. Can you tell me where my house is? Your house? Your house? I was only joking. This is your house. Is this my house? Yes. You used to play that piano. Remember? Those books you used to read? Really? What's my name? Your name? You have a beautiful name. Your name is... Kamini Kamini. How are you related to me? You forgot? Let it be. I'll tell you later. Go and sleep. I think you've forgotten your room. It's there. Upstairs. Over there. Remember? Go on. You lent me support How could you forget me? You robbed me of my peace Come to me, I'm distressed Even my fate has turned against me My stars seem to destroy me You lent me support How could you forget me? I'm in agony, I'm heartbroken Who is calling out to me? I don't know what's happening to my heart It's crying out in pain Someone is touching my heart Who is calling out to me? Oh, the storms in life My heart hopes for your return My ship is caught in a whirlwind The horizon seems so far For all your support... why aren't you here at this juncture? The agony in my heart... torments me no end Someone tell me... who does this to me You stole my heart... at first sight Oh, who is calling out to me? Now what? What is the commotion outside? What noise is that? I can't bear to hear it. You are the reason for the commotion, you were singing. - You were singing too. - You must be dreaming. You were singing. Was I? I won't sing again... never. You sang to wake up forever. You will sleep... but I'll never sleep again. Go to bed. Come on. This way. Please take me to some quiet place. Some place far away to the wilderness. Any problem here? Why do you want to go to the wilderness at midnight? - I'm feeling queasy. - Damn, you are an enigma. Please hurry up, or I'll go alone. Let's go then. I'm stuck with a mad girl. God help you, professor. For the first time you've fallen in love. And with a mad girl, too. What did you say? Am I mad? Not you. I am mad. Cover yourself. It's chilly outside. What happened? Did lightning strike the car? No. The lightning struck my heart. And my car bears the brunt of it. What does the car say? Her mind is fine, she says... but she needs rest in this stormy night. She can't move. At least shut the hood. Shut the hood. Battered and showered. The hood, too, need repairs. - This car can't be fixed. - What do we do now? Swat flies, what else? That looks like a mansion of the East India Company era. That's where we'll stay. C'mon. Strange coincidence. You stepped out and the clouds burst. Looks like you fell from the clouds. What's that noise? - What's that noise? - They belong to our fraternity. - Meaning? - They are frogs. They're also running out scared, like us. In this stormy night... we should be sleeping in our soft silken beds. Thanks to you, we're sleeping in a stable. Well, it's fine... since you must be relaxing happily. And I feel... as if I'll find peace here. Why are you staring at me? Such delicate questions are unanswerable. Please turn away. The thunderous weather is enough to lead me astray. I can't fight against two of the same kind. Please go to sleep. Why did she give her heart away? Oh, what has she done? She has melted my heart She hardly knows the meaning of love And I've fallen for her When it hurts, my heart cries out I can't take a heartbreak She is so near... yet so far away Oh, I live to see this day I remember someone... I had forgotten Oh, who has touched... a nerve again? Once again the agony of love... grips my heart I am choking... to death Who has stepped... into my life... and ensnared my very being? Oh heart, tell me... who called out to me? Who has made me weep... tears of joy? I remember someone... I had forgotten Oh, who has touched... a nerve again? Hello, professor. Where are you coming from all tied up? It's Laat. My car broke down when I went hunting. That's a big game. It took an entire cart. - It's a lion. - Lion? I must see. Don't! It's alive. It's a lioness, professor. I couldn't find peace all over the world. One finds peace only at home. I will stay here. Sir, you are rich people, who stay in the city. - You won't like the village. - Why not? What's our life anyway? A small house... cattle, we, cow dung and stove, that's all. We walk in knee deep waters during monsoon. At nights, dew falls on us, and during daytime it's dust. How will you live here, sir? Uncle, I will live like you. I am no different from you. Sir, if you've made up your mind... why don't you build a mansion? How will you live in these ruins? No matter how one's own land is... it is dearer. Have you forgotten? I was born in this mansion. If you say, we'll fix it. After the village is fixed. But sir, will your father agree to it? He has already agreed to it. Watch the muck, sir. It's gold, uncle. Soil is where life grows. It's true, sir. But muck should not be everywhere. Yes, every little thing has a certain place in life. Watch the pit, sir! How long will one fall? It's time to rise now. We must change our lives now. We must make roads. We have to make beautiful houses in place of these shanties. We have to get a pipeline here, so that we don't have to go far for water. We will have electricity. We will have schools and hospitals and every thing we need. It'll be a new world. Everyone will be happy. There will be no discrimination. Now get back to work. Goodbye. I don't know why my heart throbs Across the Jamuna river lives my beloved Oh, youth is so tormenting I can't hold back my passions I yearn for my childhood sweetheart When the cuckoo sings in my courtyard... I can't bear the anguish in her song My heart is like a ship on troubled waters Restless as it is, my heart seeks its boatswain I can't negotiate the whirlwinds anymore What is it? Who are you? Why did you clap? What are you staring at? Are you dumb? Why don't you talk? - You sing very well. - Why did you listen to me? Coincidence. I was passing by. Your song stopped me. I know you came here on purpose. Lowly city chap. You are mistaken. I'm also a villager. Villager, my foot! You're wearing imported clothes. You're quite sharp. They call me Mirch (Chilli) Salt, chilli, turmeric, spices, what kind of names are those? Take that. What are you doing? Come on, apologize to him. Apologize to him. He's our young master. Master... Never mind. Do you like this necklace? I think you should try this. It's very beautiful. Try it on. She'd like to try on this one. - Hello, professor. - Hello, Laat. Have you quit being a professor? Hunter, jeweller... are you trying something new? I shouldn't be hiding this from you. Someone has walked into my life. Professor, you have found someone... - while I have lost someone. Goodbye. - Goodbye. I told you! It looks so beautiful on you. Get off. Now that you've had a ride, take care of it. Don't fight. - I'll take care it. - I'll take care it! - You're back, sir! - Good you came, uncle. It's aunt Ganga's daughter's wedding. Here's her gift. Ganga! Quiet. - Don't mess with me now. - I won't fight. Let's compromise. Get up. - Compromise? - Yes, compromise. The young master has given gold bangles for your daughter. - What is it? - Jaggery sherbet. - Why? - For the compromise. I hope you aren't up to any tricks? - I'm sorry. Forgive me. - Why feel sorry about it? You know, father hit me black and blue that night. I had to apply salve. See the scars. - I'm so sorry. - No good. - I was thrashed because of you. - Because of me? It was because of your pranks. - You were the mischievous one. - I? Now that you've had me beaten, don't forget me. Why doesn't he burn? Why doesn't the firefly burn? The fire burns passionately... and plays with the firefly Yet, the firefly doesn't burn lnfatuation is love And one slowly... and gradually... burns in the fires of love Yet, the firefly doesn't burn Why doesn't he burn? Why doesn't the firefly burn? For a beauty, he could die He would give up his life for love For united in love... united they are in life and death So, why'd the firefly burn? The fire burns passionately... and plays with the firefly Yet, the firefly doesn't burn Professor, was your lecture about songs today? Yes. I taught the boys about love today. - It'll be useful to them. - But... this song was about the fire and the firefly. It was about my personal life. Why do you always stare at me... as if you're trying to read me? The more you read the scriptures, the more you shall be blessed. By God, you're blessed with pristine looks. You know how to flatter. This beautiful night, this loneliness... and your voluptuous beauty... compel me to tell you something. May I? For God's sake, listen to a request. For a thousand crimes of those lost eyes, I'd own up every one. You said, you'd take me to a doctor. For my own sake, yes. I'm sick. - What ails you? - I've forgotten my past. You're the one I think about. Professor... I want to recollect my past. Wise folks get rid of useless memories. I... I'm not wise. You say that I'm mad. No. I'm mad. Now that I've listened to you, at least listen to me. - Tell me. - It's quite sensitive. - I can't bring it to my lips. - Please say it. - What do you want to say? - Please tell me. If... if you... oh, what do I say? It's such a sensitive matter that even the brave ones get nervous. They can hardly voice it. Well, I'll write it over there. Please come and read it. Please come. Please. 'I love you. I hope you won't forget me'. Did you read it? - No. - No? Please read it. Professor... I can't read it. - I can't read it, professor. - Please! Try to read it. It's a question of my life. I'm feeling dizzy. I'm choking. Doctor, please come over at the soonest. Don't worry. I know her ailment. How do you know? She was brought to the hospital after a train accident. I wanted to treat her, but she ran off. Doctor, what does she suffer from? She has lost her memory. Every time she receives a shock... - she'll get bouts like this. - What's the treatment? Brain surgery. Doctor... I don't want her to undergo the surgery. Such a beauty seldom walks into one's life. - Seldom? - Only once, sir. - And he has to be one in a million. - Will you still suggest surgery? - Sorry. - Doctor, why don't you... - suggest an alternate therapy for her? - Try to keep her happy. As far as possible, try to keep her busy and engrossed. Take her to the movies, theatres divert her mind. Professor, let's go home. I'm feeling sick. - What's wrong? - I don't know. Let's go, quick. Wait. I'll get a soft drink for you. - Where were you? - I was tired looking for you. Let go! Don't ever misbehave with a decent woman! I'm sorry. She acts a bit strange. Very sorry. I want to cut my hand off for hitting him. I hit him, but it hurt me. I want that stranger to stare at me again. I loved to see him stare at me. Why did I hit him then? I was crazy. But the way he was staring at me! Tonight... Tonight I met gazes with him Through my idle heart... Through my idle heart, a wave of joy drifted Why did your heart cry out? Who have my eyes clapped on? I try to remember the past I try to remember who sang for me I hear in my heart... I hear in my heart a sweet wedding song Tonight... Tonight I met gazes with him My heart's not in place, I'm clueless I've lost sleep I've lost my peace as well I feel as if... I feel as if I have recollected a story of the past Tonight... Tonight I met gazes with him Did you hear my song? I think the professor doesn't like it. No, you sing very well. Not very well. I just hum away... - when I'm happy, - Any reason for being happy? It's a mystery even for me. Sometimes when my heart is thrilled... I feel like singing and enjoying. Then sing on. Who stops you? What will I sing? You are so angry. If I sing, you might kill me. I need to ask you something. It's urgent. Forget it. I want to enjoy tonight. I wish to go there right now. I wish to go there where we took shelter that night. Where I found peace. Shall we go? My doubts are being confirmed. I'm a man, after all. Oh, I never thought of it. I always thought of you as a professor. I suspect you. I can see love growing in your heart for that man. Love for whom? You lose your senses on seeing him. You feel like apologizing after hitting him. You get thrilled at the sight of him. Professor, I don't know why... the thoughts of him... cloud my heart and mind... and daze me. I feel as if we've known each other forever. But then when I think about it, it feels like a dream. Because, I don't know him. I've never met him. I don't know why my heart is drawn towards him. Why, professor? You can't put me off with that childish banter. Whether you know him or not, you do have a soft spot for him. If you dream such wild dreams, what will happen to our lives? We will be maligned, we won't be able to step out of the house. And I can't take that! You belong to me. And you shall be mine! Don't say that, professor. I've spoken my heart out. - I never lie to you. - You must promise me that... you'll never consider him, you'll never think about him. I'll never think about him. I'll never consider him. Never. I don't know him... why do I think about him? I'll never think about him. Never. - Jaggery sherbet. - Why are you here? Father told me to clean your room. Have you done it? Now get lost. - Where are you going? - I do all your work. Why do you get angry with me? You have no idea! My heart is wounded! There's no cure. Wounded? We treat our wounds with lime and turmeric? Want to try? - Will you get lost? - You want it right away? - Have the jaggery sherbet first. - Damn! Go away! Let me apply the salve. Where's the wound? Wound? Apply it on my head! Sure. Come here. You're so innocent. No, I'm quite bitter. But when it comes to you... God knows, I just can't be rude. I wish she was like you. She? Who? - No one. I just joked. - Don't hide it from me. Say it clearly. Do you love someone else? Who is she? - She's going to become someone's wife. - Goodness! Aren't you ashamed to love someone's woman? Father always says, 'Do not eye other's bullock, land and woman'. She might belong to someone now, but she was mine. The past belongs to no one. Take India for example. The British ruled India, but now we rule it. Now get the hell out of here. Get lost. Tell me another thing, sir. Does she also miss you so much? No. She refused to even recognize me. Short memory? You'd rather come out of it. Go away now. They always miss those who forget them. No one misses the people who miss them. Why are you here? I haven't met you before. I don't know you. I have never loved you. Get out of my room. Get out. Go away. When I don't know you, why do I think about you? She must be... feeling for me She must be... missing me When she can't stop her tears... she must be crying... inconsolably She must be... missing me She must be... holding her heart back She must be knowing... many such tricks She must be... feeling for me Sing on. Why did you stop? Why are you here? I? I don't know why. And coincidentally you are here. When you were there... I tried to call out to you, but you left. Why are you here? I don't know why. - I find peace here. - You find peace here? Yes. How come you are here? - This is my house. - This is your house? Then you can surely tell me... why I find peace here. Because I'm restless here. I don't understand... why I find peace here... why you are restless here. Some people find peace in messing up others. - It's a strange attitude. - What? Have I made you restless? Are you asking me? Ask your heart. Ask those treacherous eyes! Your fake innocence had ensnared me. Oh, we were so close to each other... like a bond of a thousand lifetimes! What are you saying? I don't understand. - I remember nothing. - Because you are selfish and disloyal. When realization dawns, we will look for each other... we will suffer, we will yearn for each other. But no power on earth can unite us then. You will be the professor's wife. And I will have married someone else. Look at me. I'm your own. Don't be misled by others. Do you remember the night of curfew when I brought bread for you? I don't remember. I remember nothing. My mind is blank. I just remember that... I ran away from the hospital and entered the professor's house. I didn't even remember my name. Thanks to the professor... for reminding me that it was my own house. - My name is Kamini. - The professor is lying. It's not your house, you aren't Kamini either. - What's my name then? - Kamini. Let's go home. Professor, I need to talk to you. Midnight is not the time to talk. You can come to the college tomorrow. No. I need answers right now. One doesn't misbehave with teachers. I have taught you in college. This is about destiny, sir. Teacher and student sail on the same boat here. You want to ask me now? Fine, come on. Why don't you get her treated? I know, she has lost her memory. - Finally! But I knew it all along. - Is it not a crime? In love, no crime is a crime. Blinded in love, you are playing with her life. That's fair in love. Someone plays with your life. - Or you play with someone's life. - Professor! Professor, let's go home. I fell in love... to gain nothing I just lost my peace What do I say... about my tragic story? Did he ever care? The one I wish for... belongs to someone else I fell in love... to gain nothing I just lost my peace My eyes deceived me, I weep in silence I failed to create my world of love I was fine... until I fell in love Then I ruined my life I fell in love... to gain nothing! I just lost my peace You held me close... only to betray me You have created another legend My tragic story... you could never remember You ruined me with a smile I fell in love... to gain nothing I just lost my peace 'You are playing dirty'. 'This is not your life'. 'God made you to teach others'. 'You are not made for love'. 'Moreover, not for the one who can never belong to you'. 'She belonged to someone else'. 'She belonged to someone else'. 'She will belong to someone else'. 'You are intruding, you are ruining their lives'. I will go and tell her that I'm getting her treated. Once she recovers, she is free to decide. She can marry anyone she wants. 'Oh, could beauty have another face?' 'No! Don't be insane'. 'Everyone in this world is an opportunist'. 'So be an opportunist'. 'Why must you abandon a treasure?' 'You adhere to your own philosophy...' 'so why care about the world?' 'Fulfil your wish'. 'Life is all about happiness and success'. At the final stage, I'm staggering. Thanks to someone's youth and beauty. No one can snatch you away from me. No one can snatch you away. He must be... feeling for me He must be... missing me He must be... holding his heart back He must be knowing... many such tricks He must be... feeling for me He must be... missing me Wonderful song. Painful, it touched my heart. - Do you like it? - I loved it. I too love it. The stranger sang it last night. - The stranger sang it? - Yes. It's a filthy song. A good song always touches the heart. I can sing better than him. Would you like to hear? - Sure, go ahead. - All right. She stole my heart, she is so innocent She has a unique style She is the one who taught me love Those eyes have given a new meaning to my life Oh, how do I hold my heart back? She is so innocent She stole my heart, she is so innocent Don't torment me, don't break my heart Don't drive me to despair I don't wish for a heartbreak She is so innocent She stole my heart, she is so innocent Her style so sensuous, her eyes so intoxicating All set to kill Who wouldn't give up his life for her? For her innocent looks? She stole my heart, she is so innocent Like it? It was a filthy song. What? I ask you for the last time. Are you going to get her treated? - You need to see a psychologist. - My mind won't be sound... - until you decide for her. - Do you know... - what is the treatment? - Yes. Surgery. Then you must know that brain surgery is very risky. - I know very well. - So why do you want to invite trouble? Because I can't see her dreams shatter right in front of me. Remember, you said... that I was being selfish. Just because you are selfish now... you want to put her life at risk. No one can be more selfish. You are mistaken. One finds happiness only when the soul is at peace. She isn't happy. I want her soul to be at peace. She is happy with her life. Please let her be happy. She is living a life worse than death. You think so. I don't want to argue with you. I'm getting late for college. I won't let you go to college until you arrive at a decision. You and I can never reach a conclusion on this. I've made up my mind. There will be a conclusion. This has driven you utterly crazy. Everything is fair in love. I don't want a lecture, I want an answer. Adversity makes a man fearless. Heartbreak drives one insane. He doesn't care for the fearless. If this is what I've taught you... if my teachings force you to do this... then go ahead and kill your teacher. What are you staring at? Why don't you kill me? If you think you are right, why don't you shoot me? Shoot! You are right. A teacher is like one's father. I can't kill you. I'd rather kill myself! - What are you doing? - You can do anything after I die. - I can't live without her. - Will you listen to me? - You have said it! - No. You said, a teacher is like one's father. A father cannot see his son drop dead before him. Take her away. Take her away as soon as possible... before I change my mind. I'm human, after all. He must be... feeling for me She must be... missing me He must be... missing me She must be... feeling for me You love this song. - Why are you here? - I'm here to take you away. Who do you mean to me? I mean everything to you. How are we related? We are poor. Every poor man is related to another. How do you know that I'm poor? Because I belong to the same fraternity. Can't a poor man know another? Impossible. I get anxious at the sight of you. I feel dizzy. I don't understand a thing. Please don't come before me. Did you ever imagine why it happens? My mind goes blank when it comes to you. That's because you love me. You lost your memory because of the train accident. Train? Accident? Love? No, no! I never loved you. I don't know you. I never travelled by train. Don't fret. Think. Try to remember. You are sick, aren't you? I want to get you cured. I'm not sick. The professor is sick. He needs treatment. I'm absolutely fine. I'm marrying the professor. Don't bother me. Go away. I'm feeling dizzy. Go away. Should I? I won't go alone. I'm here to take you along. - You can't marry the professor. - Who are you to stop me? I? I love you. I hope you won't forget me. That's what I had written inside the train compartment. Remember? Try to remember. You didn't write that. The professor wrote it. The professor has no right to write it. I will erase it. I won't let you erase it. - It's a question of my life. - My love has decided on your fate. You are my life. You must come with me. Take those probing eyes off me! Look into my eyes. You will find your way. No. No. No! You have nothing to do in my life. Nothing. The professor means life to me. I belong to him. My heart, my world... my hopes... I give everything to the professor. Go away, please. You are sick of me. I won't come to harass you. Never! Let me give you a token of love. If you ever get your memory back, do remember me. What have you done? I didn't ask you to kill her! You have forgotten me May I never remember you Please don't compel me I beseech you, let me grieve I live only for you... for those sorrows you've given me I'm heartbroken You have forgotten me May I never remember you I have failed in love I got nothing I desired I could never find happiness Our eyes met, but our hearts failed to unite I have seen the outcome of love You have forgotten me May I never remember you My heart is bereft of love For you don't love me I shall stop seeking love I shall make music no more I shall not sing, and I beseech you not to sing You have forgotten me! May you never come to mind I have forgotten you, may you never come to mind - Doctor... - Nothing to worry about. It's not a deep gash. She'll soon come around, you can take her home. Professor... How is she now? - What happened to you? - Nothing, sir. I was punished for hitting an innocent girl. - Come with me to the doctor. - No, sir. - How is she? - Don't be crazy. She isn't badly hurt. Let's dress the wound first. How are you feeling now? I'm fine. Who are you? - The doctor? - No. I'm the professor... Professor? Who? Your professor. My professor? What have I got to do with you? I don't know you. Where's my co-traveller? Laat Saab. I hope you aren't hurt? Have you really come around? Yes. I fell unconscious due to the injury. Who is he? He's my professor. He taught me in college. Your hand is hurt. Unfortunately, our train met with an accident. I hope you haven't forgotten your promise? Can I ever forget that? - Sorry, professor. - Good luck, doctor
