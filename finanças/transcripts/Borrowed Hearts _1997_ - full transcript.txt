You're welcome to share the holiday with us. But, don't you have--? There's only my son and his family. They're in Hong Kong until the new year. He has business there.Excuse me. Do Kathleen and Zoey know you're here? No, but I'm seeing them after I find out what you're up to. What do you mean? Lemme help you... You and Kathleen aren't married, she hasn't moved out of her apartment. So, why are they living with you? Kathleen's helping me out with a business transaction. Ha, don't hustle a hustler! So, how does it feel to be in the middle of closing the biggest deal of your life? I don't see how this is any of your concern. What concerns my wife and child concerns me. Ex-wife. Still... What would Javier del campo say if he knew they're not your family? I think he'd say "ay, caramba!" And hightail it back to Mexico. How much do you want, Jerry? I just need a little something to tide me over till I get back on the tour. Somewhere north of $10,000, south of 20. Let's make it 20. You'll have it the day after Christmas on one condition: You don't contact Kathleen or Zoey until then. If I want to see my family, I'll see 'em. Not until after Christmas or we have no deal. Okay, okay... Call my office. Leave your address and phone number. I'll contact you. A pleasure doing business with you, Sam. Why didn't you say good-bye to Zoey? I couldn't. You'll find most of the terms of the agreement are outlined-- well... Mexican wedding-cake cookies! Senora field, they're perfect! Thank you. Thank you! Yum! Ahem, anyway... Where were we? The contract of sale-- sale?... I thought this was a merger. Well, not exactly. Don't worry about it, darling, it's just business. You wouldn't understand. I think even my dense, little female brain can tell the difference between a merger and a sale. Will production move to Mexico? Oh yes, of course. That means most employees will lose their jobs. Are you certain that is not a problem? Oh, well-- that's no problem at all. Because we have a referral plan; they'll be fine.Just fine? Yes. Could you ask Annie for some more coffee to go with these delicious cookies... dear? Certainly... "Dear". Oh Annie, the gentlemen would like more coffee. And put some arsenic in Mr. Field's. The deferred purchase price--Mr. Field, you're wanted on the floor... Culpepper says it's urgent. He wants something done right. Excuse me gentlemen. Well! ♪ Champagne, gentlemen? Mr. Field, it's not my fault. It happened in an instant. Once it started, it was like a revolt! There you are! I knew you wouldn't want to miss this. The ringleader.Loosen up. Miss Russell, what is going on? It's real nice of you to throw this bash for us. Carly's a single mother. Like most women working here. Pleased to meet you. The pleasure is mine. I want to thank you, Mr. F. In six months, I'll have saved enough of my hard-earned money to go to nursing school at night. And it's all thanks to you. Cheers! Over there is Sarah Quincy. Her baby's due next month. She really should be at home, resting. But she and her husband bought a new house and need 2 incomes. Kathleen-- look! Susan Epstein's been here since the day the plant opened. In a way, she has as much invested here as you do, ha, come with me will you please? She's been working-- well! Okay, you've made your point-- now I'll make mine! Let me explain how business works. It's a fast track: You either run in front or get run over. I wanted you to see them before you take away their security. There are plenty of jobs for people like them. You can't begin to understand what it's like out there. I know what it's like, being there once. I worked my way up and so can these people! You've forgotten what it's like to live for each paycheque. You've never stared into a child's face who's too worried to ask questions. For a lot of these people, this job is the only thing that stands between them and welfare! We can make of ourselves anything we want. It's called free enterprise! Is that your father talking? This has nothing to do with my father! Yes, it does. You want his approval so badly, you can't see he failed at what matters. What would you know about that? If you don't watch out, you'll make the same mistake he did. Now we're getting into your area of expertise! What do you mean? You're so terrified of repeating your mistakes you won't let another man near you. Ha, that's absurd. Is it really? You just can't accept that there might be a woman out there who doesn't want you. Tell me you don't think about me when you're lying in my bed at night. Tell me you're not tossing and turning-- and wondering... I do wonder, Sam. Sometimes I feel so close to you, it scares me. Because I've already been with a man who would sell out his family and friends for a deal. What are you saying? That if I make this deal with del campo, you're walking away?! Wasn't that the plan all along? Yeah, no! One thing has nothing to do with the other! Of course, it does. Who's to say if a better deal comes along, I won't wind up like one of your workers. Ha! That's good, that's-- god, you are the most impossible woman I have ever met! I can see now why your husband walked out on you! Tell me then... Why did he walk out on Zoey, too? I-- ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow,♪ ♪ for he's a jolly good fellow♪ ♪ for he's a jolly good fel-l-low♪ ♪ which nobody can deny.♪ ♪ Which nobody can deny,♪ Thank you. ♪ which nobody can deny.♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow...♪♪ Mr. Field? I was hoping to leave a little early. I still have to get a few last-minute presents. Of course, you can-- good night. Merry Christmas. Good night. Merry Christmas. Presents! I forgot presents! Ow! I think it goes this way. How did you know that? Ah, I've done this sort of thing before. Yeah, well... That's enough, Mr. Dinosaur. You tired? Yeah. Putting people out of work must be exhausting. Ha, look... Kathleen-- I'll do whatever it takes to help those people find other jobs. I'm not throwing them out with two weeks' notice. I'll even provide placement services. I appreciate that. And I'm sorry I lost my head. I didn't mean-- it's okay. I was way out of line. I've never seen so many presents. Del campo will be impressed. They're not for del campo's benefit, they're for Zoey's. I don't know... I just wanted to give her a nice Christmas. Thank you. That's very thoughtful of you. I remember my dad. He was a milkman so, we didn't have much money. But, every Christmas, I would get one big gift. One year, I got this elaborate paint set. I just went crazy-- I painted everything. I even painted the cat! It was the best Christmas ever. What was yours? This one. My mother... She used to put my pictures up on the refrigerator, she even framed some of them. She was proud of me. Made me think I could be an artist for real. You still can. That's the dream, but... Right now, I have to think about Zoey. You're really gutsy, you know that? I don't have a choice. There's something I want you to tell you. The only reason I avoided starting a family is because I was afraid I'd be a lousy father. I've seen you with Zoey, you'd be an excellent father. Well, I look at you now and, and I see-- what? ♪ Mommy, mommy... I'm scared! I'd better go up. Mommy? Coming, honey. It's Christmas! Wake up, mommy, it's Christmas! Wake up! Wake up, it's Christmas! Merry Christmas... Senor del campo, it's Christmas! Wow-- look at all those presents, huh? Aren't you excited, Zoey? I guess so. For a little girl who has so much, you don't seem very happy. But, I thought--how do you know you didn't get what you wanted, if you haven't opened your presents yet? Good point! Who's opening what first? Mine first! Open mine first! Oh, for me? This is for you. Okay! Did you wrap this yourself?Yeah. Very impressive! What've we got here? It fits you-- I made sure. You wanna know how? I borrowed one of your regular gloves so I'd know the right size. This one won't slip around on your hand. I'll bet you can catch every single ball with it. Don't you like it? It's the best gift I ever got. Thank you, Zoey. ♪ Now, I wonder what this can be? Oh, Sam! Oh... Oh, it's beautiful! But I can't-- of course you can. It's been a dream of yours. See what we have here... Oh! This is wonderful! Ha, it looks like Santa forgot something... He's here, he's here! Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! And this is one hell of a Christmas, right? 'Morning. Thank you. Feliz navidad,sir. Senor Herbert! Well, feliz navidad, prospero ano nuevo y felicidades. Right... I got you a little something here for signing the contract. Thank you. Oh, it's beautiful. Gracias, senor. I happen to have the contract with me. Why don't we sign it now? So we won't have to wait till tomorrow. Very well. Right. It's right there. Ho, ho, ha! Senor... You know, I never do business on Christmas day, ha. But-- Dave... It'll wait. Um-- I'll go get breakfast. Senora field, look above you. Since you're both standing beneath it, are you not supposed to kiss? ♪ Zoey! Please excuse me, senor del campo. There's something I have to do. ♪ Daddy! Zoey! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! God, it's good to see you! I missed you. Me too. How pretty you look! You look just like your mommy. Hi Kathleen. I got a present for you-- I'll show you. Okay. When did he come back? A couple of days ago... Sorry, I should've told you. Daddy?... That's not her father! Senor field-- who was that gentleman with Zoey? That's Zoey's real father. I've got some explaining to do. That is beautiful. Me, you and mommy. I'm curious, senor-- why do you tell me this now, when everything you wish for is within your reach? I... I don't know. I think you do. It was stupid, pretending to have a family. You weren't pretending all the time. When you try to decide what is important, always think with the heart, not the head. The heart is wiser. Wait a minute! Wait one minute! We still have a signed contract. Yes, we do. So, it's up to you, senor field. Do you still want to go through with it? I did not think so. Well, I have no further business here. Vaya con dios. Wait! Senor! You didn't meet myfamily! Let it go. Sam, we have the signed contract! Let it go. What are you doing? How long are you staying, Jerry? I've gotta be leaving tonight--tonight? I've got this great opportunity. It could get me back on the tour. You're gonna be so proud of your ol' man. Before you leave this time, you'd better say good-bye. You're leaving? Afraid so, honey. I'd stay if I could, but-- you can never stay. Zoey, you're still the best thing in my life. I love you, darling. But you and your momma, you deserve something better. Someone who can be with you every day, honey. And I think you might have found that. Zoey... Zoey? You'll always be my special girl, honey. Good-bye. ♪ Daddy! Zoey? Zoey! Zoey! Zoey, get down! Zoey! Come down right now! Come on, Zoey! What is she doing? I want to see daddy. I'll get her! Aieee! Oh, my! Hang on, I'm coming. Zoey, I'm right here. My fingers are cold! I can't hold on! Oh, my god! Listen to me Zoey, I'm going to catch you! All you have to do is let go! No! I'm scared! I won't drop you. Trust me! Just do as he says. I love you, Zoey. And I'm not going to let anything happen to you. Now! Right now!! Aieeeee!!! Huupp. You did it! You didn't drop me! Ha, yeah... Oh!
