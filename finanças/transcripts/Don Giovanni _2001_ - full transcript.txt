In that case, my dear master, the life you lead... is thoroughly rotten. How dare you! - You swore. I don't remember swearing! Keep quiet or... I'll say no more, not even a whisper. Then we can stay friends. Listen, do you know why I'm here? I have no idea. Might it be for a new conquest? You must tell me so I can add her to my list. You're a good man. I'm in love with a beautiful woman. I'm sure she loves me. I've seen her, spoken to her, she is coming to the villa tonight. Hush! I think I smell the scent...of a woman. What a great nose! She must be beautiful! And what an eye! Let's go see what this is all about. He's already on fire. Who will tell me where the barbarian is, whom to my shame I loved, and who betrayed me? and who betrayed me? If I find the villain, if he doesn't come back to me, I will wreak havoc. I will tear out his heart. Listen! There is a beauty wandering, forsaken by her lover. I'll wreak havoc with him, I'll tear out his heart! Poor girl! I'll tear out his heart! I'll tear out his heart! Let's try to console her torment. As you have consoled 1800 others. Who will tell me where the barbarian is, whom to my shame I loved, and who betrayed me?

What a perfect description! She knows him well. Donna Elvira, calm down. Listen, let me speak. What can you say after such behavior? You entered my house furtively, cunningly. With promises and flattery, you won my heart. I fell in love. You declared me your bride. Then, disregarding the holy law of earth and Heaven, you left Burgos three days later. You abandoned me and fled, leaving me prey to my remorse and to my weeping, as a punishment perhaps for loving you so much! She sounds like a book. As for that, I had my reasons, didn't I? Yes, and what good reasons! What? Other than your perfidy, your frivolity? But the just Heaven decreed that I should find you for its own revenge and for mine. Be reasonable. She's such a nuisance. If you don't believe me, believe this good man. Except for the truth. Tell her everything. Quickly... Madam,...to tell the truth, the world being what it is, the square being not round... You louse! How do you dare mock my grief! The villain has fled! Poor me! Where did he go? Let him go. He is not worth worrying over. The scoundrel deceived me, betrayed me! Be consoled. You are, or you were, or you will be, neither the first nor the last. Look at this. This book, which is all but slim, is full of the name of his conquests. Every villa, every village, every country bears witness to his exploits with women. Little lady, this is the list of the beauties my master has loved, a list I have made myself. Observe. Read it with me. In Italy, six hundred and forty. In Germany, two hundred and thirty-one. One hundred in France, in Turkey, ninety-one. But in Spain...

In fairhaired women he usually praises their courtesy. With the darkhaired, their constancy. With the white-haired, their sweetness. In winter, he wants plump ones. In summer, he wants thin ones. The tall ones, he calls them "majestic". The tall ones, he calls them "majestic". The little ones are always "charming". are always "charming". As for the old ones, he conquers them for the pleasure of adding them to the list. His greatest passion is the young beginner. He doesn't mind if she's rich or ugly or beautiful. if she's rich or ugly or beautiful. Providing she wears a skirt you know what he does. you know what he does. You girls who treat love lightly, don't let your youth go by. If your hearts are all aflutter, here is the remedy, as you can see! What pleasure in store! Young men, light of head, don't keep wandering aimlessly. A fool's holiday lasts briefly, but mine has yet to begin What pleasure in store! Come my love, let's dance, let's sing, let's play! Come my love, what pleasure in store! what pleasure in store! At last, she's gone. Look! What handsome youth! What lovely girls! There should be something for me too. Dear friends, good morning! Go on with your music, good people. Is there a wedding? Yes, sir, and I'm the bride. I am happy to hear it. And the groom? At your service. At my service! Spoken like a true gentleman! As long as he's the husband... My Masetto has a good heart. Me too, you will see! I want us to be friends. Your name? Zerlina... And yours? Masetto. My dear Masetto! My dear Zerlina! I offer you my protection... Leporello? What are you doing, naughty boy? Offering my protection too. Go with these people. Take them to my villa, have them given chocolate, coffee, wine and hams. Keep them amused. Show them the garden, the gallery.. the rooms. In fact, do everything to keep Masetto happy. Do you understand? I understand. Let's go! Sir... - What is it? Zerlina cannot stay here without me. His Excellency will take your place. He will play your part well. Zerlina is in the hands of a cavalier. Go. She and I will join you. Don't worry! I'm in the hands of a cavalier. Meaning? There's no need to worry. What about me? Let's end this little spat. If you don't leave at once, without protesting, be careful, you will regret it. I understand,yes, sir I bow my head and go away. Because you insist, I won't protest. Cavalier you surely are. Your kindness show me this. Little cheat! You'll always be the ruin of me. I'm coming! Stay, stay. It is a very honest thing. Perhaps our master will make of you his mistress. Little cheat! You'll always be the ruin of me. I'm coming! Stay, stay! It is a very honest thing. Perhaps our master will make of you his mistress. At last, we're free, sweet Zerlina, of that country bumpkin. Didn't I do it well? He's my husband! That man? Do you think an honest man, a noble cavalier like me, can bear to see your golden face, so sweet a face, snatched away by such an oaf? I promised to marry him. Such promise means nothing. You were not made to be...a peasant, you deserve a better fate with those eyes, those beautiful lips, those white scented fingers. It is like touching cream, and sniffing roses... I don't want... What don't you want? To be deceived in the end. It is rare that cavaliers are honest and sincere with women. That is just mere peasant gossip. True nobility has honesty etched in its eyes. Let's not waste time, At this very instant, I want... to marry you. You? Certainly. This little villa is mine. We will be alone. And here... we will marry. There you will give me your hand. There you will say yes. You see, it isn't far. Let us go, my beloved. I'd like to, yet I wouldn't. My heart trembles a little. It is true, I would be happy, but you may be fooling me. Come, my beauty. I feel pity for Masetto. I will change your fate. Soon I'll no longer be able to resist. I'll no longer be able to resist. Come! There you will give me your hand. I'd like to, yet I wouldn't. There you will say yes. My heart trembles a little. Let us go, my beloved. but you may be fooling me. Let us go, my beloved. I feel pity for Masetto. I will change your fate. Soon I'll no longer be able to resist. Let us go, beloved one, and refresh the pangs of our innocent love. Stop, scoundrel, Heaven made me overhear your lies! I am in time to save this poor innocent creature from your vicious trap. Alas, what do I hear? Love, inspire me! Can't you see that I want to amuse myself? Amuse yourself... I know how you amuse yourself. Your Lordship, is it true what she says? The poor woman is in love with me. Out of pity I must feign love. Unfortunately, I have a kind heart. Flee the betrayer! Let him say no more. His lips lie, his eyes deceive. Let my suffering be of help to you. Be afraid and learn from my misfortune. Flee the betrayer! Let him say no more. Today the devil is amusing himself by balking my pursuit of pleasure. Everything is going very badly. Your weeping is in vain. Let us talk of vengeance. Ah, Don Giovanni! This is all I need. We find you at the right time. Have you courage and a generous soul? The devil must have spoken to her. What a question! Why? We need your friendship. I can breathe again. At your service, my kinsmen, my arm, my sword, my possession, my blood... all this I give to serve you. Beautiful Donna Anna, why are you weeping so? Who has so cruelly disturbed your peace of mind? I've found you again, perfidious monster! Do not put your faith, poor woman, in that wily heart The villain has already betrayed me, he will betray you now. What noble bearing! What sweet majesty! Her pallor, her tears, fill me with pity. fill me with pity. The poor girl is mad, my friends. is mad, my friends. Leave her with me, perhaps she will calm down. Don't believe this treacherous man! She is mad, pay no heed! Stay, for Heaven's sake, stay! Who are we to believe? She is mad! Feelings of strange terror... De-un chin nemaisimtit... Scorn, ire, contempt and fear... ...are roused inside my breast. Of this poor woman, they tell me a hundred things I cannot yet understand. They tell me about this traitor a hundred things I cannot yet understand. I won't leave here until I discover the truth. She does not seem mad, neither in her countenance, nor in her speech. If I go, they may suspect something. From his expression, they should be able to judge the blackness of his soul. So she...? Is a little mad. So he...? - Is a traitor. Poor woman! Liar! I'm beginning to have doubts. People are getting curious, be more prudent or they'll poke fun at you. Don't even hope that, scoundrel, I have lost all sense of modesty. Your guilt and your sorry state shall be known by everyone. shall be known by everyone. Poor woman!I want to follow her and see she comes to no harm. Forgive me, fair Donna Anna, if I can be of service to you, I await you at my home. Friends, goodbye! Don Ottavio, I'm dying! What is it? Help me! Have courage! Ye gods! He is the murderer of my father! What? There is no doubt about it! his parting words and his voice remind me of that contemptible man who in my apartment... Is it possible that under the sacred mantel of friendship...? Tell me what happened. It was already late at night, when into my room, where, unfortunately, I was alone, entered a man, wrapped in a cloak. At first, I mistook him for you. Then I realised I was mistaken. Go on! Silently he approached, wanting to kiss me. I tried to free myself but he held me more tightly. I cried out. Noone came. With one hand, he tried to stifle my voice, with the other hand, he held me so tightly, I thought I was already defeated. The traitor. And then? Finally, the horror of his vile deed increased my strength, so that, trying to free myself, twisting and turning I freed myself from him. I screamed all the louder, I cried for help. Boldly I followed him into the street to stop him. I, the assailed, became thus the assailer. My father ran out to see who it was and the criminal, who was stronger than the old man, completed his misdeed by killing him! Now you know who tried to steal my honor, who was the traitor that took my father from me. I ask you for revenge! Your heart demands it too. Remember the wound in my poor father's breast, remember his blood in a pool on the ground if ever in your heart your righteous wrath weakens. Now you know who tried to steal my honor, who was the traitor that took my father from me. I ask you for revenge! Your heart demands it too. How can I believe that so terrible a crime can be committed by a cavalier? To discover the truth, I must do everything I can. I feel in my breast, as her lover and friend, that my duty is clear enough! I must make her see she is wrong or seek revenge for her. On her peace of mind, my own depends. What pleases her gives me life. Her grief brings me death. If she sighs, I too must sigh. Her anger is mine, her tears are mine. At any cost, I must find a way of leaving this madman for ever. Look at his nonchalance! My dear Leporello, is everything going well? My dear Don Giovanni, everything is going badly! What do you mean "badly"? I went to your villa with all those people... With chatter and the usual lies, which I've learned so well from you, I kept them there. Bravo! I told Masetto many things to dispel his jealousy. Bravo, on my oath! I made them all drink. They're already half-drunk, some sang, others joked or kept on drinking. At the height of it all, guess who turned up? Zerlina. Bravo! Who was she with? Dona Elvira! Bravo! What did she say? Awful things about me. Bravo, on my oath! And you? - I kept quiet. And she? - Went on screaming. And you? When she seemed exhausted, I led her delicately out, locked the door and stole away, leaving her alone on the road. Bravo, bravo, Well done! Things couldn't be better! What you started I shall finish. With these peasant girls I want to have fun until nightfall. While their heads are on fire with wine So go and prepare a feast. If you find some girl in the piazza Bring her with you Get the dance going without further ado Make them dance a minuet A frolic, or the Allemande! Whatever And I'll be among them Making love with this one or that one Tomorrow morning my list Must increase by a dozen. Masetto, listen to what I have to say Don't touch me Why not? You don't know why? Betrayer! I cannot bear your touch Oh no. You're cruel. I don't deserve such treatment You have the nerve to make excuses? Alone with a man, you left me on our wedding day For such a villain. It's a disgrace If I didn't fear a scandal, I'd... But I did nothing wrong He tried to deceive me So what do you fear? Be calm, my love, he didn't touch the tip of my finger Don't you believe me? Come here and vent your anger, do what you want to me But then, my dear Masetto, ...but then let's make peace Beat me, dear Masetto. Beat your poor Zerlina I'll be like a perfect lamb and await your flogging Beat your poor Zerlina I'll be like a perfect lamb I'll let you tear out my hair I'll let you gouge out my eyes Then I'll happily kiss your dear hands Beat me, dear Masetto.

He'll be coming here. Let him come If only there was a place to hide! What are you afraid of? Why do you turn pale? Ah, I understand! You little cheat You're afraid that I'll find out what took place between you two. Quickly, before he comes, I'll move aside There's a nook. I'll stay there and hide quietly Listen, where are you going? Don't hide. Oh, Masetto! If he finds you, you don't know what he can do! Let him do and say what he will. Your words mean nothing. Speak up and stay here! What caprice has he in mind? Speak up and stay here! What caprice has he in mind? I'll find out if she's unfaithful Ungrateful, cruel man... and just how things went.

This time I'll give in but don't make a habit of it. Don't think you can seduce me like your women, not even with money. Don't speak about it anymore. Have you the nerve to do what I ask you? Provided we leave the women alone. Leaving women alone! You're mad! Leaving women alone! You know they're more necessary to me than the bread I eat, than the air I breathe! You have the impudence to deceive them all! It's all a matter of love. A man who is faithful to one is cruel to all others. With my abundance of feelings, I love them all. And women, who cannot reason, call my good nature "deceit". I have never seen so good a nature so abundantly doled out. What do you want? Have you seen Donna Elvira's maid? No, I haven't You've missed something lovely, my dear Leporello. I'm going to try out my luck with her, I want to whet her appetite by presenting myself dressed in your clothes. Why not in your own? People of her class have little esteem for the clothes of a nobleman. Quick, off with it! Sir, for several reasons... Stop! I can't bear being argued with! Be still, unjust heart! Do not beat so in my breast. He is merciless, a betrayer. It's shameful to feel pity. It's Donna Elvira! I hear her voice. I'll seize the moment. You stay here. Elvira, my beloved. Elvira, my beloved. Is it the ingrate? Yes, my love, it is I. I beg you to be merciful. What a strange feeling is stirring in my breast... Come down, my lovely. You will see that you are the one my soul adores. I have truly repented. I don't believe you, cruel one! Believe me! Or I'll kill myself. If you continue, I'll laugh. Beloved, come here! Gods, what a dilemma this is! I don't know whether I should go or stay. Ye Gods, protect my trusting heart. Gods, what a dilemma this is! Gods, what a dilemma this is! I don't know whether I should go or stay. Well, what do you think? You have a heart of stone. Come on, you're being an idiot Listen to me: when she comes down Run and embrace her, be affectionate Imitate my voice, then find a pretext to lead her somewhere But sir... - It's settled What if she recognises me? - She won't, if you don't want her to Quiet, she's coming. Don't fail me! Here I am - Let's see how she gets on What a mess! Dare I believe that my tears have subdued that heart? Have you repented? Beloved Don Giovanni, are you returning to your duty and to my love? Yes, beloved You cruel man! If you only knew how many tears And how much misery you cost me I, my beloved? - Yes, you Poor darling, I'm so sorry for you Never leave again? Never, my inspiration - Will you always be mine?

I think I hear someone moving If I'm not mistaken it's Masetto Who is there? No one answers; be courageous now Who is there? He's not alone, I must be careful Friends Let's hope it works Is that Masetto? Precisely, and you? Don't you recognise me? I'm Don Giovanni's servant Leporello! the servant of that corrupt cavalier! Yes, the servant of that rascal Of that dishonourable man But tell me, where can we find him? I am looking for him so I can murder him Puny threat! Great, Masetto I'll join you to help you catch my wicked master But listen a moment to my plan Half of you go this way And the rest go that way And we'll look for him very quietly He can't be far from here No, He can't be far from here If you see a man and lady walk through the piazza If beneath a window You hear a serenader Then wound him, wound him It will be my master He wears a hat on his head That has white plumes There's a large cloak on his shoulder And a sword at his side And a sword at his side And a sword at his side If you see a man and lady walk through the piazza If beneath a window You hear a serenader Then wound him Then wound him, wound him Half of you go this way And the rest go that way And we'll look for him very quietly He can't be far from here No, He can't be far from here Go on, go quickly Go on, go quickly Go on, go quickly But you alone come with me We can do the rest ourselves And you'll soon see just what that is We can do the rest ourselves And you'll soon see just what that is Quiet, let me listen Perfect.

Of course I have this musket And this pistol as well And what else? Isn't that enough? Of course it's enough Take this for the pistol, this for the musket Help! - Quiet, or you die This for killing This for cutting Villain! Bumpkin! Ugly dog! Ouch, my head Ouch, my shoulders and my chest Do I hear Masetto's voice? Zerlina, help me What happened? I've been beaten black and blue You poor thing! Who did this? Leporello! Or some devil who looks like him How cruel! Didn't I tell you that your senseless jealousy Would get you into trouble? Where does it hurt? - Here - Here Where else? Here, and also here Nowhere else?

Feel it beating Touch me here Feel it beating Touch me here. They approach. Come to me, my love Let's stay here until they pass by What are you afraid of, my husband? Nothing, nothing I just want to see if they are still far away How can I free myself from her? My love, wait here a moment Oh, don't leave me alone here Alone in this dark place I feel my heart throbbing I'm overcome by such fear I feel like I'm going to die I feel like I'm going to die The more I search The harder it is to find The damn door Easy, I've found it Now's my chance to escape from her Dry those tears, my love And calm your grieving The spirit of your father Will be upset by your agonising Allow me this bit of relief From my deep sorrow Only death, my love Can end my tears Oh, where is my husband? If she finds me, I'm finished I see a door there, I'll leave quietly I'll leave quietly Where are you going, scoundrel? Death to the perfidious scoundrel who betrayed me He is my husband, have mercy on him Is that Donna Elvira that I see? I can't believe it Have mercy! No, no, no Death to him Have mercy! No! Have mercy! No, no, no Death to him Forgive me, my lords I am not that man She is mistaken For heaven's sake, let me live For heaven's sake, let me live For heaven's sake For heaven's sake What? Leporello! What kind of deception is this? Leporello! I'm astonished How can this be? How can this be? A thousand turbulent thoughts Are spinning in my head If I escape from this, it will be a miracle O Gods, what a day this has become! What a day of consternation If I escape from this, it will be a miracle it will be a miracle it will be a miracle A thousand turbulent thoughts are spinning in my head If I escape from this, it will be a miracle So it was you who treated my Masetto so cruelly? So it was you who deceived me by imitating Don Giovanni? So it was you who dressed up to deceive us? Let me punish him No, let me No, leave him to me Let's all three of us deal with him Have mercy, my lords, have mercy You are right, and so is she But I'm not the guilty one My tyrannical, dominating master Robbed me of my innocence Donna Elvira, be compassionate You understand that he made me do it I know nothing about Masetto Just ask this young lady I have been with her for an hour or so To you, sir, I say nothing Certain fears and certain mishaps Are overtly clear but obscure inside No place to hide, the door, the wall I'll go that way toward the side And then hide there as it is known as it is known If I only knew a way out of here I would have escaped! I would have escaped! Stop, scoundrel! Stop! The rascal has wings on his feet He got out of here so skilfully My friends, After all that has happened We can no longer doubt that Don Giovanni Was the barbarous murderer of Donna Anna's father Stay here for a few hours I'll get recourse to justice I promise you all revenge very soon Duty demands it, compassion and love! Meanwhile, my dear treasure try to console The tears from her eyes Wipe away Tell her that I will punish Those who wronged her I will only return when I can say We've been avenged with his death Meanwhile, my dear treasure try to console What kind of heinous deeds Is that wretch embroiled in? No, heaven's anger can't be delayed Or justice postponed I already feel the fatal thunderbolt Falling on his head I see the deadly abyss open Poor Elvira! What contrasting emotions are stirring in your breast! Why these sighs? Why this anguish? He betrayed me, that ungrateful soul He makes me so unhappy Betrayed me And abandoned me Yet I still feel pity for him He betrayed me, that ungrateful soul He makes me so unhappy Yet I still feel pity for him When I feel my torment My heart cries out for revenge But when I think of the trouble he's in My heart starts throbbing for him Ha, ha, this is a good one. Let her try to find me What a beautiful night It's brighter than day. It's made for going around in search of girls. Is it late? It's not yet two o'clock. I'd like to know how it went the affair between Leporello and Elvira. If he was sensible He wants to be the ruin of me. Oh, Leporello! Who's calling? Don't you know your master? If only I didn't! What,you rascal? Oh, is that you? Excuse me What happened? Thanks to you, I was almost killed. Wouldn't that have been an honor for you? Come, come this way Come this way I have some great things to tell you But what are you doing here? Come inside and you'll find out All kinds of adventures have happened in your absence But I'll save them for another time The best one I'll tell you now Is it about women? Did you doubt it? A beautiful, young, kind girl I ran into on the road I took her hand but she tried to run Do you know who she took me for? I don't know. For Leporello - For me? For you - Good Then she took me by the hand Even better She kissed me and embraced me "My dear Leporello! Leporello, my dear!" Then I realised she was some girl of yours. Damn you! I took advantage of her mistake I don't know how but she recognised me and screamed It was time to run So I jumped over this wall here And you tell me all this so indifferently? Why not? And if the pretty girl was my wife? Even better! You will have your last laugh before dawn. Who spoke? Perhaps a ghost Who knows you well Quiet, you fool Who goes there? Who goes there? Insolent rogue Let the dead sleep in peace! I told you! It's someone playing a joke on us. Isn't this the statue of the Commander? Read me the inscription! Excuse me... I never learnt to read by moonlight. Read, I tell you! "Upon the evil man who ended my life, here, I wait to vengeance..." Did you hear that? I'm trembling You old buffoon! Tell him I expect him for dinner tonight What madness! I will not Oh heavens, What terrible looks he's giving us! Like he can listen and wants to speak Get over there or I'll kill you and bury you here! Easy, master As you please. Oh, most illustrious statue Of the great Commander Master! My heart is trembling, I can't go on. Finish, or I'll put this blade through your heart. What a mess, what folly What fun, what amusement I feel myself go cold I want to make him tremble Oh, most illustrious statue Although you're made of marble Dear master! Look! Don't you see him looking at us? Die! Die! No, wait wait! My lord, my master My master, not me, Would like to dine with you! What a scene this is! What a scene this is! Oh heavens! He nodded his head You're a buffoon You're a buffoon! Master, look again What should I look at? With his marble head he nods like this, like this. Speak if you can. Will you come to dinner? Will you come to dinner? Yes! I can hardly move, let's go! The scene is indeed bizarre. The old man will come to dinner Let's go and prepare the meal Let's leave here,I beg you Let's leave here,I beg you Let's go and prepare the meal Let's leave here,I beg you Be calm, my love This libertine shall be punished soon And we shall be avenged Oh God, my poor father! Let's bow our heads to heaven's will Breathe deeply, my dear Tomorrow, your loss will be rewarded By this heart and this hand My tender love What are you talking about at such a sad moment? What?Do you want to increase my pain with renewed postponement? You are so cruel! Cruel? Oh no, my love! I regret so much that I keep you from a happiness That our souls have so long desired But the world, O God Do not attempt to make waver My delicate, sensitive heart My love for you should be eloquent enough Don't tell me, my dear love That I am cruel to you You know very well how much I have loved you You know my faith You know my faith. Calm your impatience If you don't want me to die of sorrow Calm your impatience If you don't want me to die of sorrow Perhaps one day, Heaven once more will take pity on me.

I don't understand this! Ta! Ta! Ta! Ta! You're completely crazy! Did you hear? - Someone's knocking Open the door - I'm trembling Open it, I say Lunatic! To solve this puzzle, I'll go and open it myself. I'll never see that man again, I'll quietly hide. Don Giovanni You did invite me and I have come. I would never have believed it But I'll do what I can Leporello, come serve another meal, have it brought immediately We're all going to die Go, I tell you Stop right there!

Tell us, and be quick about it! I can't go on . Be quick, tell us about it It was amidst smoke and flame Listen carefully The man of stone He seized him Just under there That's where he struck The devil swallowed him up What are we hearing?
