They'll announce the time to me - Which camera shall I start with? - Camera One Get ready. Action 3, 2, 1 And tonights guest: Dr. Alam... the significant neurologist, who accepted our invitation for tonight Welcome Doctor Please, introduce yourself to our audience, and then we'll move on to the questions In the name of God What program was it? I don't know On the one side they're making candles... and on the other side they're preparing stew And at the end, they say: "Welcome to your own program, Doctor Yes, it's interesting Tell me about the race. Is it on? Over here, it's rainy and the track is slippery Who's joining the chartroom today? As usual, Khalilzadeh from Malaysia Didn't he say anything about his bet? Two on Wilcox. But you better not believe him The doctor put us in trouble because of his delay Eat Doctor, it's lamb meat. Please eat You won't get fat. I eat three, maybe four meals a day If I go home and don't eat my dinner, my wife will be upset She'll become suspicious All men are afraid of smelling their lover's perfume... and I must be afraid of going home with a full stomach Shall I tell them to bring a kebab for you? It's fresh lamb kebab No, thank you I'm listening Doctor, go ahead. I'm used to this situation I can talk to someone, listen to someone else, and work at the same time The doctor arrived two-three days ago... And despite being very busy, he examined father He's doing us a favour No wonder they call him Gold Finger Doctor, my father is Gold Finger as well Give him dried whey shares today, and gold shares in five days First we rely on God, and then on you Of course, I don't have any role here I mean, I hope it doesn't get to that point The surgery team which Dr. Zabeti has gathered... is one of the best all over the Middle East I'm not exaggerating With the bill the doctor has sent us, It must be as you say When will you start, Doctor? We're ready As soon as your father's blood pressure becomes optimal, we can start I've told you a hundred times... that I don't like to deal with such upstart people You won't be doing anything, Doctor You'll sit in the room and read your newspaper... while we put the heart of that poor bike rider into the chest of his father Who wants to live as much as Noah? But I've told him that, due to the old age of his father... a specialized neurologist like you has to supervise the surgery -Do you have a problem with that? -No By the way Doctor, the Middle East part was great. You're becoming smart Not as much as you I'm good for nothing if I don't know you by now By the way, I'll break your neck if you call my new secretary "darling" one more time Okay, darling It's Hajji Firouz. It's once a year The Hajji brings good news, yes Salute Hajji. My boss is here It's breaking time, so break it.

Peterson, number five, Wilcox, number six I'm reading these from the brochure They announced that Blake Edward and City Star aren't competing -Today is my lucky day. -You're something, Khalilzadeh Last time your horse ranked 11th, you were saying the same thing Stop interrupting. Let him read the list. I want to see what to do Well, Engineer Shayan. You too? What's wrong with us, Dr. Alam? Nothing. I just thought you only bet on mares You lost, Mahmoud. You should have bet on it Which one, Wilcox? Wait Yeah, right. You call this mule a horse? Just go on like this. You're 700 pounds behind Let me give my report Doctor, someone has come from the City Sky organization Where? The City Sky organization He has a suitcase with him - Yes, its Saman's present - What shall I do? Ask him to come in. If there's anyone left, send them in The horses are ready at the start line The flag is hoisted. The race has started - What's this? - Hello Doctor I didn't know it would be such a hassle It's a telescope. You ordered it Do you have the test results with you? - Allow me to set this up - Is it necessary? - I have to deliver it - Okay Doctor, this is Mrs Bayat's file By the way, your son has been waiting on the line for a long time - Yes? - Hello Hello. What's wrong? Nothing. I just wanted to say that the telescope... Yes, I know. I got it Can you give it to me tonight? Yes Before the celebration is over? I said yes When? I don't know when. Whenever I finish my work Is everything in order over there? Yes. You can send it in a cab... If you can't come in one or two hours I thought you may be busy No. I'll bring it with me You don't send a birthday gift in a cab Have fun Today was a busy day, and... I couldn't manage to pay a visit to the hospital Well, how is our sleeping beauty? Just like the previous days, Doctor Keyvan says nothing has changed But I think she's become thin. My child is shrinking day by day Mr. Ramezani said you've asked them to discontinue the monitoring Of course, I'm only telling you the opinion of the physiotherapist To be honest, I must say that she'll get even worse She won't even hear anything... and I don't think she'll ever be able to recognize anyone In Maryam's situation, physiotherapy would have been impossible... and it had to be discontinued - Excuse me, Doctor - Yes Please sign here Thank you I have a question. You have to think properly before replying If we find any infection or disease in her body... do you want to continue the treatment or not? I don't know Doctor What's usually done in such cases? If her situation becomes critical... she has to be hospitalized in the special disease ward Even if we disregard the high expenses... what would the result be? Huh? She'll live a few more years, but... You mean you want my daughter to die sooner? I understand your situation You can't imagine what I'm going through Maybe I might not be able to feel what you're going through... but I know your child's condition Imagine getting stuck in a well in the middle of the desert No light, no sound No one knows your there Believe me, there's nothing more that can be done Goodbye Yes? Excuse me, Doctor She's asking if we can take her on a trip with us A trip? For the pilgrimage of Imam Reza Yes You can Did your horse win, Doctor? No, I didn't make any bets this time They've brought this from the radiology center Nothing has been written on the envelope Okay, I'll take a look later on Can I leave? Yes. I wish you a happy new year For you as well. Have a nice vacation. Goodbye, Doctor Goodbye. Sorry, I was about to forget to give you your New Year gift Keep in touch with me during the holidays Thank you, Doctor I don't think you have this cell phone number It's for the New Year. Don't mention it at all Thank you. Happy new year Happy new year to you You can't tell if it's a war or a celebration Yes. If you would allow me, I would like to leave now Yes, sure - Goodbye Doctor -Bye - Salim - Yes Come up. I want you to carry something to my car Hello. We won't be able to reply during the New Year Holidays Please leave your message after the beep. Thank you Hello? Doctor? It's Jahanpour I've just arrived at the radiology center I didn't want to send those X-rays to you Are you there? Please call me. It's urgent I'm really sorry. I wanted to talk to you in person I came to the radiology center to pick up the S-rays and come to you... but the staff had already sent them to you by mistake They thought it belonged to one of your patients I think your acting hastily Why do you want to ruin his birthday party? My daughter is over there as well The house phone is busy... and Saman doesn't pick up his cell phone Mahmoud, please stay calm Okay, I'll ask them to do an MRI tomorrow You better sit down I asked for a simple radiography Why did you conduct a CT scan Okay. Sit down and I'll explain Listen Mahmoud, the ICP symptoms in Saman are very evident How come you never noticed? He has nausea and feels dizzy -Dizzy? -Yes Didn't he tell you? A few days ago, when I returned from my trip... Badri told me that Saman had a headache for a few days. That's all It's a good thing Badri is there to know what's going on in your house But I asked him, and he didn't say anything to me He explained something to me He said, a while ago... when he was watching the sky with the telescope... he saw two moons Negin had told me that Saman feels dizzy at times Negin. My daughter Did he have a fever as well? We better disregard a tumor for the time being It might be a simple inflammation Did he have a fever? No Queen won the race. Can you believe that? The closest horse was six yards behind No wonder this horse costs half a million pounds I wish you were here to see what this horse did. Mahmoud? What? I thought it got disconnected. I was talking about the horse race He did great. You won 4,000 pounds. What's wrong with you? I've given you good news. Maybe it's a heart stroke from joy If you have a 17-18 year-old patient with high ICP symptoms... who has filled up a vast surface of his supertentorial, what would you do? Are you testing me at this time of night? What patience you have No MRI has been done, but several upward extensions can be seen in his CT scan Then say he's already dead I can tell you without seeing it, the invading apendimums are Ana-plastic I'd bet on that He won't even last chemotherapy once he leaves the surgery room But cut the brain. At least your students can see one case, and learn something How can I tell a youngster that he's dying? Well, tell his parents. Doesn't he have anyone? What's wrong with you, Mahmoud? Mahmoud? Can you hear me? Hello? You could have called and informed us that you weren't coming Don't ear this rubbish. You'll lose your appetite I'll prepare breakfast right away -Breakfast? -Lady needs to go to airport I'm going to Isfahan. I'm taking Ardeshir with me We want to go to Kish with my sister A man is coming along with us I'm telling you this so that you don't make a scene later Even your son has noticed that you care more about your own fun than him He wasn't that upset, anyway. He was worried about his telescope Will you take them to the airport, or shall I call a cab? Badri? I'm coming Yes? - Does Saman feel sick again? - No But he's not in his room. Where is he? After the party he left with his friends from the observatory -Where to? -The desert I don't know. The same place they went last year Hello? You have to have the password to see behind the curtain Come here Hurry up - Goodbye, Badri - Goodbye Happy New Year, father. We couldn't be together, once again. Saman I don't know why this child is always in a daze recently He forgot his backpack I think his mother sent this Poor child. You didn't come to his birthday party... and his mother didn't even call There we go again You'll end up somewhere bad like this I'm going to Sarbisheh, and I won't be back soon Find someone to take care of your life Hello? Elahieh Observatory? Please sir, I know it's not a good time to call Last night, a group of observatory members headed towards the desert I said the desert. They went to the desert Yes Do you know their exact location? Yes I'm so confused. It's like they've collected my exam paper... before I ever had a chance to write anything on it You're looking for someone to blame You haven't found anyone to blame but yourself Saman has switched his cell phone off Can you ask your daughter to call me? Yes, why not? Does she know anything? Of course she doesn't Actually, I'm worried for both of them, Mahmoud I don't know if Negin has fallen in love with your son because of astronomy... or if it's vice versa I had no clue Hello Doctor, pick up the phone of you're there We're taking the old man into the surgery room Get here before they find out Just sit in the surgery room for two hours, then you can go... wherever you want. I'm waiting for you, darling -Hello - Hello Doctor. It's Negin - Negin? - Negin Jahanpour Oh, Yes. I've been trying to call Saman, but his cell phone is switched off Thank you for calling. Can I speak to him, please? Doctor, sorry to say this, but if he has switched off his cell phone... then maybe he doesn't want to speak to anyone Where are you now? In the desert. The Mesr village caravanserai Saman and the others are on the rooftop. We're waiting for the others to join us The others? The Isfahan Observatory members are supposed to come here today The Tabriz group will join us tomorrow Last night we waited for you a lot. We wished you were there I was watching the film just now Yes, he's left his backpack. All his stuff was in there You know, Saman was very upset last night If I tell him you're on the phone right now, he might get upset again It's a good thing that you're taking care of him By the way, which one are you? What? As I told you, I was watching the birthday party film Which one are you? You can easily find me I'm wearing a scarf. A green scarf with white flowers Yes, I found you Wow He has good taste, just like his father But Saman isn't like you at all Last night, he knew that you weren't coming No offense, but Saman was counting on that telescope for tomorrow's competition I mean, all of us I mentioned it to Saman a few times I mean, I wanted to talk to you before, but you know how Saman is He even hides the smallest matters from you Yes - Hello. Do you need any help? - No, thank you Were you talking to me? -No, not you By the way, I'm on the way now On the way? Yes. I'm coming to join you. You said the competition is tomorrow night? Are you pulling my leg? No I can't believe this. But why? Don't you want the telescope? We came third last year, but you didn't know Saman won't believe this if I tell him Then don't say anything to him, okay? It's very interesting. I'm sure this will make Saman happy So let's keep it between us for now, okay? Okay, sure. Bye Hello father, how are you? Can you show me the way to Mesr village? Hello. You're on the right road. Turn right a bit further Okay, thank you - Hello, Engineer - Hello. What has happened, Hajji? It's broken down, like always Excuse me. I want to go to Mesr village, can you show me the way? Thank you. In the name of God It's too hot for this time of year What about your motorcycle, Hajji? First of all, I'm not a Hajji But you can call me that name, and God may accept it Secondly, everyone knows my bike around here When the villagers see it, they'll load it on a tractor and deliver it to my house That was quite a lot of dust you made They had told me that this road is asphalted Yes, brother. That's because you've come the wrong way Do I have to go all the way back? No. There's a route from this side as well I'll get off at the Old Asia village, and there's a road over there. I'll show you You follow the road and you reach an asphalt route, and... that route will lead you to the Mesr village How can I roll up the window? Yes, well done These foreigners are very intelligent It's a pity they belong to hell Hell? No, it's not like that Everything has two faces One face is the one we see, and... the other is all that goes on in the heart of people For example, the desert The appearance is something, and the nature is something else You better see the heavenly side Now, why do you want to go to Mesr village? Have you fallen in love? No. My son and his friends have gone there for astrology researches It's the desert, and a sky full of stars Astrology has its own world So you know about astrology, as well? Not the modern astrology We had our science of the stars in the past You can tell the destiny of people... from the location of the moon and the stars in the sky These stars aren't shining on the top of our heads for no good reason They're talking to us You just need to have a wise ear They said it's sinful, and I put it away They said one shouldn't interfere in God's will, and such stuff But I know someone in this desert If anything gets lost and buried under the sand... he can tell the location by looking at the stars Don't you believe me? You shouldn't You haven't seen these things I have to move from one place to another. I somehow manage to make a living Right now, I'm going to recite an enactment sermon God knows when I'll manage to go home to my family God knows that I'm not objecting. I'm just telling a story But you didn't tell me anything. I was talking all the time What kind of doctor are you? Neurology So we're colleagues. I work on the brain and nerves as well This place used to be the graveyard of ten villages once But now this is the only thing left of it The world is like this. It doesn't even have mercy on the gravestones The world is unfaithful Doctor, wait a second. Stop Oops. I think we're in trouble. I'll be back soon It seems I can't have a day for myself Who's dead? - What are you doing here? - I'm digging a grave I can see that. I asked "why are you here?" Everyone has gone to the wedding, and they've sent me here to dig a grave Hello, I'm not at home at present. Please leave a message. Thank you Hello It's me, Mahmoud Like always, your phone is on the answering machine I wanted to say something important about Saman Poor corpse is under enough pressure in the grave... and you're not even willing to give some extra space to him? It's big enough He keeps telling me "it's big enough" Who has asked you to come her and dig a grave here? Uncle, everyone has gone to the wedding. They sent me here to dig a grave All my clothes have become dirty. Let me go to the wedding Rise. Rise. Don't act like a sissy - This is the head's side - Okay, I know - Have you done the ablution? - No, I don't know No, this is too small This is big enough, uncle. Hajji Mirza will fit in it When a person dies, the corpse becomes the same size as his or her youth Do you want me to dig a grave the same size as you? No. Mirza Mehdi was tall As tall as this doctor Hello When did he die? God bless his soul This morning he came to the square and sat on his chair Then he said: "Ouch, my chest" His heart stopped, and he went to the other world And when I say everything needs a specialist, they disagree They've sent a kid to dig a grave. It's a good thing I came The grave digger has thought that it's a bad omen... if he digs a grave on his daughter's wedding night Someone needs to tell him that it's the wedding of the one... who has died as well. Both of them are going to the house of fate - House of fate! - Yes, what difference does it make? Yes, but I know a lot of people who are willing to pay loads of money... and sell all their life to avoid going to this house of fate So what? One day, all of us have to leave The pit I saw was similar to everything but the house of fate By the way, Hajji... if someone comes to you and says you're going to die in a month... what will you do in the remaining time? Nothing. I'll fix the bike Then at least it wont leave me in the middle of the road... and I can get on with my work Look. If you think I'm loaded and can pay you to postpone my trip for a month or two... I must say that I can't This is Gholam. He'll dance until he drops Honk. That's enough Come over here. Come on - Hello, uncle - Hello - Did you hear about Mirza Mehdi? - Yes Don't say anything, otherwise you'll change their celebration into a mourning ceremony Hopefully, I'll engage them and then I'll go and say prayers for him You're welcome. Goodbye What are your plans, Doctor? It will be a pleasure for me to have lunch with you - Hello - Hello. Go and play This isn't a snack. It's the wedding lunch Thank you. As I told you, I have to get there before night time Sorry for bothering you. Forgive me Don't mention it at all Just go straight ahead and you'll reach the road to Mesr Village Do you want me to send someone along? - No, thank you - God be with you Goodbye That's not fuel It's gasoline -Do you want fuel? -Yes How much do you need? The tank is empty. I need about 60 liters Each 20 liters will cost you 4,000 tomans. Do you want it? Okay, no problem Come on I'm over here Do you want tea? - No, thank you. Is this the fuel? - Yes Isn't it dangerous to store fuel in here? All of it isn't fuel. I've got water as well I want one of these gallons as well.

She talked a lot - When did they leave? - It was 1999, 2000 - You mean the astrology team? - Yes They left at noon Do you want to join your son? How did you know that? I met him. I examined him.

It wasn't anything serious, sir He had nausea, and he felt dizzy Sorry professor, I didn't mean to worry you First, I thought it's sun stroke because they were under the sun all day But when he said it's not the first time, I thought maybe... - Hello? - Hello Doctor.

It's good for heatstroke Although he wasn't feeling well, he wanted to know about the people over here He wanted to know where they are I drew him as well. He took the drawing with him God bless him.

It will take a second You'll be fine Saman is very lucky to have you as a father He'll be fine, right? I mean you must be able to cure him I'm not an expert. But there must be a way... a surgery, or maybe chemotherapy I'm sure you've cured patients with worse conditions Hello, Happy New Year There's someone over her who wants to talk to you Hello -Hello son, how are you? -Fine Are you fine? I'm fine. Negin told me right now It wasn't necessary to go through so much trouble I've brought your birthday gift. Didn't you want it? What trouble? Negin said you need it for tomorrow's competition So it was your doing? No, I swear to God I didn't say anything Hey, don't make a scene. I wanted to come Has anything happened? No, why? Is mother fine? Yes, actually I called her today and... like always the phone was on the answering machine. Why did you call mom? I wanted to tell her that the gift she's sent for you has arrived. Actually I brought it along! Hold on a minute Wait, here it is That's nice It shows that she still thinks about you. What is it? It's a letter. -So she did it at last? -What? It's a long story Is it a secret? Not a secret! But I don't think it'll be interesting for you It's about a spaceship That's interesting! Really? Yes, it sounds interesting! In 2007 NASA will launch a spaceship It can exit the solar system and go to a place... where no earthly object has ever gone Don't tell me that your mom wants to board that spaceship! That spaceship has no passengers What a pity, it was becoming interesting! Whoever wants can record his or her voice and send it with the spaceship Imagine that; a spaceship full of different voices with different languages They can transmit their messages to a remote and unknown location Mom has paid $2000 so that we can record our voice and send it as well Us? Yes, Negin and I! A dual voice message! She's a nice girl She really likes you It's a long time that I wanted to talk toyou about her but it wasn't possible I wanted to... There's someone here who wants to talk to you Who? Someone wants to talk to you. Hold on a second. The doctor wants to know if her patient is doing fine Talk to him. Please He can hear your voice Hello? Hello? Hello Saman Hello, is it you, Doctor? Yes, are you feeling better? Yes, I'm better. Where are you? An emergency came up and your father was kind enough to bring me here Everyone says hi to you We were about to go and sit at our own New Year's table. Your New Year's table? Yes. Tonight we want to watch the great nebula in Orion They say whoever sees the great nebula in Orion... on the arrival of the New Year his or her wish will come true Of course, it's a feminine belief -Where is it? -What? The nebula you mentioned If you look at the west you can see three bright stars in a straight line, that's Orion If you pay more attention you can see three less bright stars... which are lower than the first three The star in the middle is the great nebula in Orion. Did you find it? Yes. Of course, what you say is only the constellation Most nebulas can only be seen with a telescope The great nebula in Orion is the birthplace... But the Skelmo nebula is worth watching as well It's the most beautiful graveyard I've ever seen Graveyard? Yes, the nebulas are the birthplace and death place of all the stars They return to their birthplace I didn't know stars die as well. All of them die Many of the stars that we see now might have died millions of years ago We can only see them because they are so far from us You mean they're that far? So far, so close When we compare them with our own world they're so far But only if we compare them with other galaxies... we can find out how close they are to us and we've been unaware of that It's a local dish. Asad's wife taught me how to prepare it Thank you, I didn't want to bother you Don't mention it at all, professor I forgot to bring water. I'll bring it right away Didn't you want to spend the night with your family No, I won't leave. I'll spend the night here It's the meat of a new born camel. It's very delicious They beheaded it for the bride. It was God's will for you to have it I'll sleep here. Call me if you need anything I'm not a heavy sleeper Hello? Where are you Doctor? Saman isn't feeling well Saman? No matter what we do, he doesn't regain consciousness What has happened to Saman? I don't know. He was tired, and he went to take a rest But when I came to call him he Ndidn't answer, and he wont wake up now First of all, you have to try and stay calm. Okay? Okay Now, tell me exactly what happened What? He's regained consciousness? Hello? What's going on there? Saman, move aside, Saman dear Saman, can you hear me? Saman, are you fine? - Doctor? - Yes He's regained consciousness. He can hear us, but he can't move - We don't know what to do - It's not important - He can't open his eyes - Everything will be fine, dear What should I do? - Listen. Can you help me? - Yes, what can I do? Go forward, and open his eyes with your fingers What shall I do? Go and move his eyelids with your fingers Okay Hello? Saman. Saman, I want to open your eyes Can you see me? Yes? Can you see me? Doctor, he can see me now. He can see me now I told you. In half an hour he will be able to move his eyes Shouldn't we take him to the city? No, no I'll be there by tomorrow. If it's necessary, we'll come back tomorrow Wait a minute. I think he wants to talk to you Hello Hello, professor You scared everyone How are you? You tell me Okay. This is a kind of anxiety attack Your eyelids won't move for a short period But you'll recover very soon Is that all? Trust me Okay It's not nice to underestimate your father in front of your friends Don't worry I'm not worried about myself - Dad? - Yes, dear - Will you promise me something? - What? Don't say anything about my sickness to mother... or Negin What's this childish nonsense you're saying? This is a simple anxiety attack. You'll recover soon It's natural for a youngster your age The telescope I've bought for you is very well equipped The seller said you can see up to the end of the sky with it Even the best telescope in the world only shows 4% of the sky Well, I didn't know that You have to teach astrology to me whenever you have the time You better take some rest I'll call you in half an hour to see how you're doing - Bye - Goodbye I can't. I can't talk to him This is so unfair You have to be hopeful God is mighty God? Yes, God is very mighty We have built is so that whenever we fall into trouble... someone can come along and say "God is mighty" But the problem is that God is too mighty You're not feeling well Really? Why don't you put me on drips Or maybe you want to recite poems and sketch my face and hang it on the wall What nice people. And God is all around, so there's no other problems Your food is getting cold, professor What do you know about life? I've saved a lot of people from death with these two hands But I never saw God show up round there And about those who died in my hands... people like you came and blamed me for it It was God's will. God is kind Why doesn't God help me? Why can't these hands do anything now that this child needs help? Excuse me, professor But I don't think Saman is the one who needs help Why did he leave without telling us? He left? I had brought fresh bread for him You can see, strange people Hello Doctor.
