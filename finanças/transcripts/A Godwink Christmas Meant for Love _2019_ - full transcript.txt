RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Helen, will you grab the ham, please, honey? I got it, I'll get it. Good thank you so much. - Okay. Anybody seen Alice? - I hear them coming. Hey, boys. You've been good? - Yeah. - Yeah? Don't break anything, all right? Here. Give me that. Hey, boys. Hey, Charlie and Mickey, would you mind just grabbing those last two dishes over there and bringing them over, please? Where will two more dishes fit? - I'll find room. - She'll find room. Next thing you know, he was doing the laundry. Well, just because the holidays are busy doesn't mean you have to do all the work. Your husband has to chip in. That's what I said. This is the first Christmas you're spending with your new daughter-in-law, right? Yeah, and I don't know how that's gonna go. Nervous? A little. We haven't exactly seen eye-to-eye. Well, loving your son is common ground, right? True. But we've barely seen them since the wedding and... I don't know. You are a wonderful, loving mother and you have raised a great kid. It's natural that they want to spend time by themselves... and maybe you don't quite know where you fit in anymore. Maybe. I'm sure that she's nervous, too. Just... Be open with her. And that way, you'll find out why your son loves her, and she'll find out why her husband loves you. Thanks, Alice. I'll give it a try. I have total faith in you. Okay. I brought karaoke. Of course you did. My favorite nephew! Fill this house up with music, okay? Hey, have you seen Alice? I thought she was staying to close up shop. I heard she was closing early. It's three weeks till Christmas. We can't close a retail store early. You know what I'd like you to do, sir? I'd like you to go help those children untangle some lights. Thank you. Told you she'd be mad. I'm not mad! Hey. I just closed up now. Good, sweetheart. Okay, get here quickly, okay? We're having so much fun already. You do remember what tonight is, right? Yes, I know, and I'm on my way. I just don't want you to miss anything. See you soon. Love you. Love you, too. Bye. Hi, Mrs. Laurent. Hi. I'd try to lease the place myself, if I didn't want to retire soon. You always say you're gonna retire, and you never do. And what would we do without your amazing cookies and cakes? You guys going for it? Yeah, we'd love to expand. I just need to crunch the numbers. I heard the Beans & Brew chain was looking to rent it. Well, no matter how much I love coffee, I mean, this is a mom-and-pop street, with stores that have been here for decades, like ours. Your family's lucky to have you keep up the tradition. Yeah, well... If I don't go to the tree-trimming, they're gonna throw me out of the family. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Alice. And those are my fourth-quarter numbers. I think that covers the year-end. Great job, Jack. Your sales have almost doubled from last year. Well, you know what they say... "do what you love, never work a day in your life". And I am not the only one who's noticed, either. And I didn't come all the way up here just to year-end the regional sales books. It hasn't been officially announced, but... I will be moving to the Chicago office first quarter next year. Congratulations. Well, you know you're gonna be missed here. Thanks. Jon and I wanted to be closer to the kids while they're at college, so it's a win-win. And the board is thinking of promoting someone from within. They want to approve their replacement by the end of December. Would they consider hiring outside of headquarters? Why, do you know somebody interested? Well, maybe. I'm heading back to Minneapolis tonight for bi-monthly sales calls, and I need to finally close that university hospital deal. Great. So you can attend the corporate holiday party. - We can talk more about it then. - Sure! Are you driving straight there now? No, I need to finish up a few things here first, and then a tree-trimming stop on my way. Say hi to Nabeh from me. And Jack... Remember my secret. Find the balance. See you in Minneapolis. - There's my girl. - Hey, everyone! Sorry I'm late. We had last-minute customers. Tell your mother a retail store needs to stay open in December. "A retail store needs to stay open in December". Enough about that. Just tell your mother what you want to eat. - I ate before I left. - What? Kidding! You think I'd come here not starving? Works every time. Now you're both on lights duty. What? I want to feed you. Wait till you see. Liz says "hello", uncle Nabeh. It sounds like she's predicting big things. Yeah, well... let's hope so. You could finally move back to Minneapolis. Which would leave you here by yourself. Come on, it's been two years. Your parents' estate has been settled. It's time. But you have to come back for every Christmas. You know I'm not missing Christmas. I'm gonna put some Christmas music on. Yeah. They're not gonna let some big coffee company take over the empty store. Well, if a chain with a proven track record brings some reliable traffic, maybe the stores will support it. And if one chain comes in, what's stopping others? Next thing you know, we got a glorified strip mall, and everything we've built over the last decade is gone. When I tell you what your father and I weathered putting that store together... Yeah, trudging through the snow every day, uphill both directions! My go-getter son. Climbing the corporate accounting ladder instead of coming into the family business. Every bit of ambition I have, I got directly from you. Thank you. And you... keep it up. Okay. As for me, as soon as we get this store expansion resolved I am finally going to retire. No one believes you when you say that, you know that, right? Yeah. Well, if anyone can make him retire, it's my favorite cousin. Well, don't let the other cousins hear you. Yeah, they're not my favorites. You've been rightful heir to the store since you were... what, 17... 16? When'd you start working there? - 15. - See? Race you! No fair. You got a head start. Hey! Hey! No running in the house! Oh, you cuties. Those "cuties" just tried to shove the rest of the reindeer cookies into their pockets. Yum! Should we get them home soon? Yeah, can you? I promised the office I'd go back and finish that proposal. You have to go back to the office tonight? Yeah, I mean, we're gone all weekend for the wedding, so... There are those "cuties". Boys! Hey, maybe you two can, squeeze a little karaoke duet before you go. If only. It's been ages. Okay, everybody. The ornaments are sorted, so who's ready to trim a tree? Me! All right. So you're driving all the way to the wedding? That's a long ride. Yeah, well, I'll be able to get all my calls done uninterrupted, it'll be great. All work and no play, huh? When was the last time you had a girlfriend? Ask the guy who hasn't been with anyone since aunt Rae. Hey! I had my great love. You haven't had yours yet. Wouldn't be fair to connect with someone right now, work being so hectic. I don't even know where I'm gonna. That's just an excuse, Jack. You dad loved this one. Take it. I don't have a tree. And I'm not going home tonight. I think you should have it. As a reminder. I should get going. Meetings in the morning. Why didn't you just drive from the office? I couldn't miss this. Besides... I promised. "And a promise..". "...is a promise". Come here, come here. Don't worry, I'll get there by 11:00, all right? All right. Drive carefully, all right? Will do! No, no. Honey, leave that. Edgar and I will get all that. And take some food. Mom... look. It was dad's favorite. Yeah. Should I put it up on the tree? No, baby. You keep it. Put it on your tree. Okay. Hey, I had a thought... Friday night. You and I should go out on the town. Put on a pretty dress, high heels. I don't know. We have to drive to the wedding in the morning. It's the Christmas Schooner Gala. Remember? You used to love it, and you haven't been in years. Okay, this isn't one of those "surprise Alice with a charity gala that's really a way for her to meet a man and settle down" things, is it? What kind of a mother does that? You. Every three or four months. Well, I'm right on schedule, aren't I? Listen, honey. I know Neal hurt you so bad when he moved away... He took a job. Yeah, but it's been over a year. You need to get yourself out there again. She's been on one or two dates. And I have enough things keeping me busy, so... So? Perfect! Friday night. 'Cause I already bought the tickets. Hey, girls... How was your night? Didn't get enough last night, huh? Well, are there enough decorations when it comes to your family? So we might try to lease the space next door? Well, if we can put together a strong proposal, but the owner is a real-estate conglomerate, so it's not like when dad and Charlie bought our space with a handshake 40 years ago. Well, if I can do anything to help more... Are you kidding me? You working here this past year has been a huge help. Well, I do have an accounting degree I could dust off, if it helps with the expansion. It's all really exciting, right? Yeah. Absolutely. Alice? We have that big delivery later today. Do you think you can stay longer tonight? I'll check, but I think Mickey's working late... As usual. Is everything okay? Sure. You know, you need to pick out a dress for that schooner thing tonight. I'm just gonna wear the navy blue one. Again? Hey, what good is having a family store if you don't go shopping in it? I've got the perfect dress. And finally, if we combine these territories, we'll streamline deliveries and cut costs by 10%. I like it, Jack. I think the board will, too. - You think so? - Definitely. But you need to show them that you're ready to take this on. Think about spending the better part of December here in Minneapolis. - That'd be my pleasure. - Good. Now, enough shop talk. I'll see you at the party tonight, right? Absolutely. Thanks again, Liz. Don't thank me. I just want to make sure the best person for the job has a fighting chance. Maybe I should just go. No, no! Absolutely not! Sean's mother is having trouble with the caterer for the rehearsal dinner. But I'm on my w... wait, wait. That's probably her. Okay. Go. Go, meet people. I'll be there soon! Bye! ...they'll truly save lives. Yes, I'm just heading into my company holiday party now, why don't we set up a show-and-tell for later this week... I'm... sorry. No, I... I'm sorry. I'm Jack. I'm Alice. You're still holding my hands. Yes. Yes, I am. You headed inside? Yeah. Yeah. - Well... - Okay. Thank you. Sure. Some party. Yeah, I love "the Christmas Schooner" story. I'm not familiar. A ship captain transported fir trees down the Great Lakes on a schooner for homesick immigrants during the 1800s and 1900s. Never heard that before. They usually have stations with crafts and wreath-making, and I think there's an "ugly sweater" contest, too. How good are you at wrapping presents? Well, not my strong suit, but, how hard can it be? So, what department are you in? I didn't have anything to do with this. I'm just visiting. From out of town? No, just right here in Minneapolis. I work in retail. That's why we haven't met. I'm in sales. What kind of sales? Digital-imaging technology for hospitals. Now I've blown it. It was definitely about the patient-care aspect in the beginning. Lately, it's probably been more about the logistics... and I've been talking non-stop for way too long. - Haven't I? - No, not at all. I love hearing about what people do, especially when they're as good at it as you are. Well, it helps to have a good listener. So, we should probably go mingle. I haven't met with half the people I'm supposed to. Who are you supposed to meet? Cameron, Bill, and Jackie. Company board members? What company? Willis Medical. Is that who you work for? Yeah. I mean, don't you? No. You said you work retail. At my family's store. Then what're you doing at the Willis office party? We're not at the Willis office party. Yeah, we are. We're at... we're at the Christmas Schooner Gala... That raises money for the lakes? Minneapolis, the land of 10,000, but really 15,000, lakes? - Oh... Kay. - The ships... so you're saying I've been at the wrong party this entire time? Does your company usually host gift-wrapping and wreath-making at its Christmas party? I keep suggesting it, but... You know what? This is all your fault. Mine? Yes. You're too distracting. Well, I think you're really just talking about your phone. Guilty as charged. Well, I don't... I don't want to keep you. You should probably get to your party and see Cameron and Bill and... Jackie. I really should probably go... Yeah. It was really nice meeting you, Alice. Nice meeting you too, Jack. Merry Christmas. Oh... no. "Oh, no", what? I just... I lost my ride for Iowa tomorrow. What's in Iowa? I'm going to a wedding at the Silver Center Resort. I have a wedding to go to at the Silver Center Resort. My cousin, Sean, is marrying a doctor. My second cousin, Regina, is a doctor. What? Do you need a ride to the wedding? N... that's kind, but I don't want to put you out. I was just gonna make some calls, but... Maybe a different kind of distraction is exactly what I need. Okay! I don't even know your last name. It's "Marina". Alice Marina. Jack. Jack Totah. Well, Alice, I'll... See you tomorrow. Looks like we've got a plan! I had your hand there again. This was a terrible idea. I don't know what I was thinking. No, it's good you got somebody to go with. Except he's a total stranger! But she's a total stranger. I mean, what if we have nothing to talk about for hours on end? Well, talk about the wedding. We're not gonna talk about the wedding for six hours! I called Sean's mother, who called Regina's mother, and she said that Jack's a really sweet guy. What if his car smells? What if she doesn't like my music? What if he doesn't say anything? What if she talks non-stop? I don't even know why I said "yes". Why did I even invite her? Honey, you're going to have a wonderful time. You'll have a wonderful time. Bye. So I figured caffeine for the road, and I'm slightly co-dependent. Well, great minds. We'll probably get there in about four hours. Not accounting for bathroom breaks. Yeah. So, I'm gonna stow my phone for the ride. There is one work call that I couldn't move, hope that's okay. Yeah, no problem at all. Great. So... What music do you listen to? Christmas music? I start the day after Halloween. You too? You okay with the heat? No, it's, it's comfortable. Thanks. I could've picked you up at your place, if that was easier. No, I wanted to get some work done before we left. I've always been on the corporate side. How do you find the small-business world? Is it exciting? It has its ups and downs. Right now, I'm trying to lease the space next door to us, and it's... This is probably so boring. No! No, are you kidding? I love talking shop. Ooh, speaking of shop... This is the work call I got to take. - Yeah. - I'll be quick. Hey, Liz. I know, it's a problem. What would happen if we broke down in the middle of nowhere with no caffeine for miles? That would be a fate worse than death. Correct. I love just getting out of the city and breathing in the country air. I actually wish I could spend more time in the city. Because you travel for work so much? Actually, I'm only there twice a month. Wait. What? Yeah, I don't live in Minneapolis. I'm up for a promotion, and if I get it, I'll be there more permanently, but... Oh, no. "Oh, no", you're getting a promotion? "Oh no... the tire's flat". What was that thing you said about breaking down? Could be worse. At least we have lots of coffee. And tires. And bears. "Oh, my!" I am so sorry about this. No worries. How long did they say? 45 minutes. They'll text. Okay. Wanna go exploring? Great idea. Okay. - Shall we? - Sure. This looks like a cute store. You okay? Yeah, I think I tripped on... Nothing. Too much, uh, caffeine, I bet. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Yeah. Look at this. You should wear this to the wedding. I'm gonna buy it for you. Only if... you wear this. Aw, yeah. I am so obsessed with chocolate santas! - What? - I'm totally getting these. - My dad loved ships. - Bells were my dad's favorite. "Were"? My dad passed away when I was little. Alice. I'm so sorry. My parents both passed in a car accident a couple years ago. Jack, that's awful. Must've been pretty tough for you, being so young. Yeah, but... I have a very big family. And they were there for us. I always had someone to talk to. What about you? My uncle. We were always really close. Tell me more about this family. Well, my mom remarried when me and my sisters were teens. My poor stepdad! But he really smoothed the rough seas. So, we're pretty lucky. I have a ridiculously large family. So do I get to meet this ridiculously large family at the wedding? Well, they're kinda loud and overbearing and... Sounds perfect to me. I've never been to one of those large family gatherings you see in movies. It'll be fun. The tire fixed? Another 30 minutes. More chocolate santas? Actually... I have a better idea. What's going on? You ready? I don't know what you're planning, but... Hey! Snow angels! Come on! What are you waiting for? The water's fine. It looks a little cold, but... My gosh! Ho, ho, ho. This is the most fun I've ever had getting a tire changed. Well, you definitely have to make the most of every situation. Yeah, I think I'm just gonna turn in. Thanks, mom. I love you, too. Bye. Hey. So we missed the rehearsal dinner, but I was able to rustle us up a little something-something. Ooh! Dessert for dinner. Okay. I think the elevator is down that way. Yeah. Well, I am at 302. And I'm 312. This is just gonna keep happening, isn't it? Apparently. Well, thanks again for the ride. Yeah, anytime. I'll, see you at the wedding. See you then. - Hi. - Hey. So my crazy mom was afraid I wouldn't have eaten. I figured... half for you. Well, now I have to meet your family to thank them. For what? Preventing me from turning into a sugar cookie. Okay, well, goodnight. Goodnight. - Again. - Again. - Okay. - Okay. Thanks. I hope he does that... Good morning. - Good morning. - There you are! What a day you had, huh? Flat tire, missed the rehearsal dinner. It was fine. Actually, it was fun. Really? It's not like that, I told you. Well, you wouldn't even have met if I hadn't bailed out on that gala, and then this man just happens to walk into the "wrong" party, and then the two of you just happen to figure out that you're going to the exact same place... right here. Which means they could've met here. It's not like that! The both of you. Well, we look forward to meeting this young man very soon. Do you have to? Yes! What's his name again? Just tell me what his name is. Jack. Totah. Hi. Hi! Hey, hey, hey! - He's so cute! - What did we say? Why did they have to sit him on the bride's side during the ceremony? Nobody got the chance to talk to him. Mom, please. I've told you, it's not... "...like that". I know, I heard you. There's Bryce. I'll be back. - Hey, mom, where are you going? - I'll be back! I'll be back. Don't worry, we won't embarrass you. I know, at least you won't. That's one down, only 40 Marinas to go. So where are we sitting? They are place cards for everyone. Our table is just over there. So... I hear you met somebody. Are you kidding me, mom? I thought, after Neal, you... She's ready to move forward now. Don't we have anything else to talk about as a family? Thank you! He is just a man that I met... So you admit you did meet someone? Okay. Shall we just move on with the reception now? Where am I sitting? Where's my place? You're at the little kids' table with all the little kids. The one night that me and Sal could've used a break. It's gonna be fun. Mom, did you switch these? There he is. Excuse me! - Aren't you Jack? - Hi! I am so happy to meet you. I'm Olga, I'm Alice's mom. It's nice to meet you. Thank you for dinner last night. - My pleasure. - Speaking of which... I'm having trouble finding my place card. You know what, you're actually right here. Next to... Alice. - Imagine that. - Lucky you. Kids, what did I say about running? Jack. It's nice to meet you. Likewise. Shall we all sit down? Yes. Prepare yourself. Got it. So, Jack... Tell us whatever you want to tell us about yourself. He's in the medical sales field. He loves his job, he has an uncle he's close with, and he adores Minneapolis. And can he speak? Well, everything Alice said is true. I come from a small family, I love my job, and my uncle is very special. Uncles are the best. They are the best! Cream and green sprinkles. Ooh. I got some red ones here. Ooh! Ooh, give me some. Hey, guys! Can I get a picture? - Yeah. - Lean in. Come on. All right. Beautiful. So, you didn't want to bring a plus-one? No. I... You mean...? Yeah, but if, you know, if it's a thing... - No. It... - 'Cause I didn't... - It... it... - Not a thing? There was someone, but it ended a year ago. He moved away for a job, and I... What about you? Well, work's been so crazy these days, I... Hasn't been someone for a while. Hey... Do you want to... Dance? Okay. I love Christmas trees. Me too. It's a shame I can't have one this year. No way! Says the guy who listens to Christmas music the day after Halloween. I know, I know, but I'm spending so much time in Minneapolis, I just won't be home much. That's fair enough. Hey, you didn't wear your tie. Yeah, I thought I'd save it for a special occasion... Like, when we get a flat on the way home. Wait. You're gonna give me a ride back? Do you not want a ride back? Oh, no, that... that sou... Thank you. That sounds good. Will you excuse me for a moment? - Sure. - Okay. Haven't seen you dance for a while. So you think the two of you are gonna see each other again? You know, usually when I get into the range of "do you think you're gonna date this guy?" I get a little pushback from you. It's okay. No, he's a nice guy, I just don't think I'm ready for something right now. Maybe in the new year. What's going on here? There's nothing going on, but I'm... You're a terrible liar. Tell me. I'm just... I've been having some weird numbness in my fingers, and I've been... Tripping a lot. I thought I was tired... I am tired... Well, you need to go to the doctor. I will. I mean, as soon as we get back. You need to make an appointment. I've just been doing too much... But... you're right. What? You're right. Come here! You're choking me. But you said three words mothers love to hear. "You are right". Jack offered to drive me back. That's good. Right? But he doesn't live there. He lives in Dublin, Wisconsin, that's 90 minutes away. So he comes into town. Yeah, twice a month. I did the long-distance thing with Neal, and we all know how that worked out. Honey... That's not the only reason that didn't work. This connection that you and Jack have... so many coincidences like that just don't happen. All right? I feel like there are godwinks afoot. Okay, I have to admit there are some unlikely coincidences... Yes! And we need to listen to them when they happen. You need to open up your heart again. Ring your bell out loud! Listen to your mother for once. Love you. I love you. Thank you. Yeah, and the little flower girl! The father-daughter dance was the highlight. So cute. I had a really nice time with you tonight. So, head back after breakfast? Yeah. Well... goodnight. - ...Alice. - ...Jack. Living in a hotel must not be the most festive of locations. No. No, it is definitely not. Although I did stop at my uncle's on the way through. Got a little tree-decorating in. Yeah. Why did you leave Minneapolis? Don't answer, if it's too personal. No, no. I just... Never really talk about it, is all. I went back to Dublin to settle my parents' estate. I was the only... the only child that could do it. That's a lot of responsibility. That was never really the question. I would've done anything for them. Willis let me transfer to the nearby local office, and the plan was to move back to Minneapolis after that. You don't want to stay in Dublin? That was a beautiful place to grow up, but I love living in the city. We need to make one last stop. You can't want another coffee. You know, I don't think my residence hotel will appreciate me having a full-sized tree in my room. Not full-sized. They had them last year, I swear. Maybe this should be your family business. You know, every time I mention the store, you get quiet. No, I... do I? How do you feel about all this? You know, taking over the store? Well, I'm the heir. That's not what I asked. My dad and my uncle started the store when they were just off the boat from Italy, literally, they were teens, and I started working for them at 15. My sisters... one of them's in Germany with her lieutenant husband, and the other's in Texas with her career... Is there something... else you've dreamed of doing? What? I didn't say that. I work with a lot of business people. It's clear who wants to be there and who belongs somewhere else. I can't think about that. Even if I did, I've never done any other job. When my sisters were gone, it was just assumed that I would do this, so I never... Thought of your own dream? Close your eyes for a second. If there's one thing you could do in this world, what would it be? - Jack. - No, I'm serious. Close your eyes. What's the one thing in the world you like more than anything else? Connecting with people. Listening to them. Walking people through tough times. Being someone that... They come to for advice. But... What does that even mean? Your family is so loving. Don't you think they'd support you through figuring out what it is? Yeah. Maybe. There it is! What? - Wait a second. - Alice? It's portable! It's the perfect solution for my mobile situation. We're actually really close to my apartment. Do you mind dropping me off? Sure, what's your address? 2632 Pauline street. Seriously? Seriously? So... 2635 is where my company puts me up every time I'm in town. You're joking. Nope. You know, my mom would say that this is a "godwink". A godwink? It's a coincidence that isn't really a coincidence. So, maybe you and I could, you know, run into each other again, on purpose? Do something... Christmassy? Sounds great. - See you then. - I'll be over here. Okay, and I'll be here. - Okay. - Okay. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. There you are. Mom. What have I told you about doing this? I knew you'd be getting home late, I knew you wouldn't have any food, and I knew you wouldn't have any time to shop. Okay, you have got to stop doing this. I also brought Christmas treats. You have got to stop doing this... Unless it's Christmas treats. Good. Go. Sit. Eat. Okay? I want to hear everything. And I also brought some more Christmas decorations, 'cause you just don't have enough in here. Hey. I thought you were gonna check in with me during the ride. Is everything all right? Everything's fine, yeah. They asked me to stay over for a meeting in the morning. Well, that's good news, right? It is. And how'd it go with Alice? Actually, she turns out to be pretty great. Yeah. I'm not sure... It's not a definite, but... I think I might be working too much. And maybe should be doing more christmassy things. Really? She got me a mini-tree, so... I'm just gonna start small and see where things go. And you know what, anybody who can convince you to do that, I have to meet her. Well, hopefully, I'll be seeing a lot of her soon. I hope so. See you, Jack. Hey! Your shift isn't until 11:00. Yeah, it's the last few days before the boys are on Christmas break, so I want to use the time while I still have it. Is that the loan application from the bank? I need your help. So, if the property management company is looking for a stronger bottom line, it's because they're trying to mitigate risks, so we have to show why we're a better risk. Coffee shops opened and closed multiple times, but you've lasted 40 years, so what's a bigger risk? That's a good way to frame it. Hey... I have to run to a doctor's appointment. And FYI, I told Mrs. Marks no more credit extensions. I know she's gonna try with you because she knows she can't with me anymore. - Hi, Alice. - Hey, Mrs. Hart. I just wanted to bring these for you. Thanks to our chat the other day, I spent the whole morning on the phone with Stacey, and it went so well. Well, I'm sure it's onwards and upwards. Thanks again. Bye. Thank you. You're so good with people. What's your secret? Just be curious. Listen. That's most of it. I'll at least finish up these documents and then we'll tackle the rest together? Okay. Thank you. Alice Marina? Some numbness in your fingers? Only numbness? Well, I've kind of had, like, these... tremors. Like, I can't quite get them to work right sometimes. Anywhere else? And my legs sometimes, too. I've been having these spasms. Like, I've been quite clumsy lately. Okay, well, I want to take some blood and run a few tests, and if you're okay with it, let's take an MRI to rule some things out. - Okay? - Okay. So I think I'm just gonna get back to the lease documents... And make dinner with the groceries you're carrying? Hi. Hey. What are you doing here? I was hoping you'd want to chat, you know, the old-fashioned way, face-to-face. You busy right now? No. I didn't know that you were still here. Don't you have to be in Dublin in the morning? 8:00 A.M., but I'll just get an early start. Pastry dinner? It's got my mom's cookie exchange night. I can't bake, so it's torture, and then nobody wants mine. Well, lucky for you, I can bake. Of course you can. Okay, so you only need a little flour on the pin, and then if it's still sticky, you just add a little more to the mix. So you're saying I just can't roll with it? How's the family? Well, Sally Ann, Mickey's wife, has some great ideas for the expansion. Alice. Yeah, we're slammed right now because the deadline to submit the paperwork... - Alice. - Is around the corner. You still haven't talked to anybody about this, have you? I can't have that conversation, I told you. The conversation where you talk about what you should be doing? That I'm not sure of. Somewhere, deep inside, you know... And when you do, I'm all ears. Hey, Charlie. What're you still doing here? Alice and I were talking expansion issues earlier. I'm trying to focus our strategy and finish the loan application. What are you doing? I've come to look at the loan application. May I join? Yeah, of course. Almost done. So, tell me, how did you wind up in the medical field? Oh, you're changing the subject. No. I just want to know what inspires you to do what you do. Well... I had an older brother named Eddie. He died when he was 13. I'm so sorry, Jack. It was a brain tumor. He was an athlete, the funniest guy I ever knew. And when things started to go downhill, I was the only one that could get him to take his medicine, eat, even tell a joke. I'm sure he appreciated you so much. Caring for him changed my entire life. There's not a single day that goes by that I don't miss him. That's why you push yourself at your job so hard... To give people the resources so that they can care for their loved ones. It certainly started out that way. Yeah. And you know, if I can make things easier just for one person, all of it will be worth it. That is an amazing tribute. He did also make me promise one thing... that I wouldn't just live a big life, but a full one. Cookies. All right, where did the oven mitts go? So, there is one option we haven't thought of for leveraging against the chain and guaranteeing the loan. Putting up the store up as collateral. I didn't want to say it. I've been thinking it, too. You know... Maybe what Skyway Properties is looking for is variety in the neighborhood. Is there a way that we can expand, and diversify what we sell? What? Does your husband know you're some kind of a genius? These turned out pretty great, huh? I don't know how I'll pay you back for this, but I promise you I will. Oh, my! It's, uh, it's 2:00 A.M. - I should... - No! No way. - Yeah! - What? I've got to be in Dublin in six hours. Well, go on, go to your home across the street, and back to Dublin. You know, every time I say that, it sounds like you're going to Ireland. Well, maybe we could arrange for you to see Dublin sometime. Maybe we could. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Hey! Hey. I thought you might want some caffeine this morning. Well, thank you. I thought you were supposed to work. I decided to take a personal day. You did say I should visit Dublin, right? I did say that. Well... Should we visit Dublin? Let's do it. I'll follow you. So... A lot of great shopping on this street. My favorite lunch spot is right over there. There's uncle Nabeh to escort you around while I go to two hopefully quick meetings, before I play hooky for the rest of the day. I know that this is last minute, so if you can't fit it in... No, no, no! Come on! You're in Dublin. Let's live it up. Uncle, Nabeh, thanks for coming. This is Alice. Hello, Alice. I've heard so much about you. You don't mind spending some time with a total stranger this afternoon? Well, we were strangers not too long ago. - I guess that's right. - That we were. So, start this way and then work your way back. - Okay. - Shouldn't take too long. Thank you again. - Okay, have fun! - Bye. All right, let's go. She didn't say where she was going? No. Just asked me to cover for the day. I'm gonna see if she's home. You sure you're gonna be okay here all day, alone? Yeah, I've got this. - Okay, see you later. - Bye. It's just so lovely here. You know, my wife, Rae, she used to run that candy store right there. She could hardly wait every year, to dress it up for the holidays. Jack said she was very special. So is someone who could convince him to take half a day off work. So what do you do here? I'm retired, mostly. Still got a handful of clients. What kind of clients? I'm a family therapist. What's that like? What's up, Mick? Hey, the school called. Mario's sick. Can you get him? Would you excuse me for just one second? Mickey, I always change my schedule for you. Now, I just found out that someone from the property management company is coming today instead of tomorrow to do their evaluation of the store, so this time, I think you're just gonna have to make it work for me. You can bring Mario here. He can lie in the back, if you've got to go back to work, but I gotta go. Sweetie, I'm here! Ally? Where are you? That is so cute. I came over on a boat. Yeah, I left my family and moved to America. And then, when I was able, I got my brother and his wife... that's Jack's parents... to join me. I think ships are my lucky charm. You know, my dad and his family came from Italy the same way. - Really? - Yeah. And bells were his favorite. You know what? I think your family and my family built something beautiful. We'll take 'em both. On me. Okay. Thank you. Liz. What're you doing here? I came to tell you we need you back in Minneapolis right away. Why? What's wrong? Nothing. We just can't have our new VP living so far away, now, can we? Are you serious? I came to take you to lunch to celebrate and let's talk about the transition! Thank you so much for going to bat for me, Liz, and I am ready for this. I can't go to lunch today. I have another lunch that I need to go to. I can call you tonight, if that's okay? - Of course. - Okay. Fine. Thank you! - Congratulations. - Yes! So the cookies are a bad sign? Honey, she's never made cookies this pretty in her life. Maybe she bought them. There was flour residue in her sink! Should we call the FBI? Stop it. She... she doesn't bake! You know that. She had help. Santa? Or one of his elves? Jack. - So? - So! Then she took a day off from the store. Edgar! Honey, she's getting herself a life. Is that a bad thing? No, it's just... She loves the store. Unless she's finally admitting to herself that she doesn't want it. Come here. These will look really cute on you. You said your friend's a fan of the wild, right? What about... this? Red, green, and gold? Hi. Do you need help finding anything? I'm with Skyway Properties. Hi. Usually, Alice Marina... I just want to say that the owners are entertaining one other offer, but your financials are in order, and I've seen everything that I need to see today. Alice and Charlie sure have a great nose for store managers. Thanks. Hey. Where's Mario? He's in the car, he's lying down. He didn't want to move. For once. Was that the property manager? That's a pretty big deal, right? Yeah, it kind of was. Congratulations, hon. Thanks, Mick. I have to get back to everyone, but you can bring Mario... Yeah, I'm gonna... Gonna take him home. Put him to bed. You're not going back to work? No. Your uncle is amazing and this town is so wonderful. You should see it in the summertime. And, Tuesday is jazz night, they have... Well, I can't always play hooky from work and drive the long round trip or have you drive the... Yes, you in the sweater? There's another option. They just offered me the promotion. - What? - Yes. Jack, that's incredible. In Minneapolis! I mean, how do you feel about that? But what difference does it make how I feel? Well, not how you feel, but if it's... Interesting to you? Alice, I've been wanting to move back to Minneapolis for a while, and this job and with you there... Take the job. That is... I am not the person to blurt things out. Or ask for what she wants, except you seem like this person. I am... with you. With you, I got into a car with a stranger, drove six hours, and then six hours back, and then I played hooky, and went to Wisconsin to meet... a guy. All good though, right? Yeah. You inspire me to take risks, and do things I never dared to do. You've opened my eyes to... New things. Did you figure something out? I talked to your uncle about being a therapist. And I think it's something that I could do if... Thanks. - If... - Say it. If... I could tell my family I don't want to run the store. I'm gonna tell them. Tonight. That isn't crazy, is it? No crazier than us being in the wrong place at the right time. Over and over. And over. Maybe... Maybe this is how you find your life. My mom figured out I've played hooky. Will you excuse me for a moment? Sure. Hey, mom. I am fine. I'm in Dublin. Dublin? You just picked up and went? You're the one who told me I should take a risk. Yeah, but can you maybe just check in with your mother first? I'm not sure that's how risk works, but I'll be home tonight, in time for the caroling and the exchange. I saw your cookies, by the way. Mom! Seriously, stop breaking into my apartment. I have a key, remember? The cookies were incredible, so I took 'em. I'll see you tonight. Okay, love you. Love you. Hi, Alice. It's Dr. Draper. We got your tests back and we need to schedule a time for you to come in. Will you call us back as soon as possible? Thank you. Think I'm putting on weight just looking at them. Yeah, yeah, it's too bad she had to stay at home with Mario tonight. I feel terrible about today. I left Sally Ann in the lurch. No. No. She was amazing. She had everything under control and then some. That's great. Yeah. Isn't that great? I might've dropped the ball with Sal. No, I did. I dropped the ball. Tell me. We both graduated with accounting degrees, but when we got pregnant with the twins, we agreed that she'd step back and be the more hands-on parent. Supposed to be temporary, but then my career took over, and I never... She should be tearing up the world. How do I prove to her that I want that for her? Say that. All of that. What, you think that's enough? Surprise her! You two met doing karaoke. Yeah. Yeah, Christmas night at the bar. And we're going caroling tonight... We'll be around the corner from your house. You are a genius. Okay, everybody, grab your cocoa, and start to warming up those vocal cords. You aren't singing. And Helen and David are tone deaf, but you don't hear them going stone-silent. No worries. Play backup. Play it out loud. Hey, where's Mickey? He slipped off a few houses back. Said he'd meet us at the last house. This is the last house. Yeah, we just have, one more "last" stop. Hey, kiddo, why are we stopping at your house? Just one last carol. Okay. You remember this? Of course, I remember. I put you behind the eight-ball with the kids and my job. And that is on me... That's gonna change. I don't want to be the guy who holds you back. I wanna be the guy... ...who helps you soar. I love you so much, Sal. Alice, your report of numbness and tingling, spasms and clumsiness, they're common signs of a particular condition. I'm afraid you're in the early stages of multiple sclerosis. I... What? Well, MS is a progressive disease of the central nervous system. It occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the healthy nerves of the brain and spinal cord. But how did I... No one knows how it comes on or why certain people are affected. The good news is, you've got an early diagnosis. There are therapies and treatments to help you manage and slow its progression. We'll connect you with a neurologist specializing in MS, and people living with it. There will be challenges... But there are reasons to be optimistic. Hi. Hey, I got called into town for another last-minute meeting. Did you want to grab dinner? Or are you still full from all the cookies? I am, but... Sure. I'd love to grab dinner. Great! Well, see you tonight. The table will be ready in five. This is a nice place. I'm glad you like it. The food is incredible. It'll blow your mind. Everything okay? Yeah. Fine. I'm so excited to be back here for good. I've been so busy with work, I haven't even thought about what part of town I want to live in. I know. The holidays have kept my whole family busy. Have you told them yet? No, but I will soon. I know I have to. I can't keep putting it off forever. Well, you'll speak from the heart. They'll understand. Speaking of telling people things... Yeah? I, wanted to say... Thanks again, for just making me realize that I needed a change. I know that it's for the best, all of it. No matter what happens. We helped each other. Yeah. I'm so sorry. No, it's okay. I'll just grab a napkin, and then it will be all good. I think I need to go home. No. Hey. It's all right. Really. It just comes right out. Are you okay? I'm sorry, Jack. I just can't be here right now. Alice? Alice! Alice. Hi, Jack. So good to hear your voice. Is, everything okay? I mean, I know it's busy in Minn... Jack... I need to tell you something. Maybe we moved too fast. Maybe... Well, we can slow things down... No, I... I think we should... ...stop seeing each other. I was wrong to think that I was ready for a relationship right now with everything going on at the store... The store? I thought you said... Look, if this is about the long-distance thing, I'm gonna be moving there in a couple weeks... No, no. It's not that. You should take the job. I know it's your dream. What about your dream? Alice, look, this doesn't... this doesn't make any sense. Can I at least see you in person? I'm gonna be in Minneapolis and... I'm gonna be really busy. I gotta get to the store. So... I'm sorry. I'm really... Goodbye, Jack. Seriously, mom, we talked about this. You haven't answered your phone. You playing hooky again? Did you hear from the doctor? Baby. I'm here. I'm here. We're gonna get you the best doctors, the best support system possible anywhere. Anything you need, whenever, we're gonna get it. We are here for you. Just don't cry. I'm just crying because I'm so grateful. Well, did you think we'd ever let you go through this alone? Just tell me you're gonna tell Jack. I was about to tell him and... I don't want to put him through this. He doesn't want this. You don't know that. He's moving here for you. For a job. No! And for the promise of you, too. You are still the same person. Am I? Yes! Yes. You have challenges ahead... But we'll get through them together. But you are the same beautiful, wonderful person you've always been. And you are worthy of love. Just tell him the truth, though, honey. Give the man a chance. He had a brother that died when he was a kid and his parents died two years ago. I don't want to put him through that again. He deserves better. Honey? What happened? The people from Skyway Properties just called. They're signing with Beans & Brew at the end of the week. By the end of the week? We need to figure out something A.S.A.P. Yeah, I'll keep thinking, too. Thank you, Sally Ann. Okay. Bye. Uncle Charlie? What are you doing right now? An espresso and coffee bar in the expansion? That's brilliant. Coffee goes with everything. We have to tell Skyway before they sign with Beans & Brew. That way, they can get what they want. It was Sally Ann that started it. Her idea to diversify? Yeah, and we can get Mrs. Laurent to provide her amazing pastries, too. And maybe she can retire. And you can, too. I know you've been trying to do it for a while. I can hang around as long as you... You have put 40-plus years into the store. I know it was your dream and I will make sure that it stays exactly the way that you and dad hoped. Your dad and I, when we came over from Italy, we met another teenager on the boat. He had escaped a pretty bad circumstance in Lebanon and didn't know what was ahead of him. The three of us became really good friends. And your father made us all promise... that we would chase our dreams here, and whatever we achieved, we would share it with friends we met and families we built, and with each other. And that's where "a promise is a promise" came from? And what did the boy on the boat end up doing? I don't know. We got separated at immigration and never saw each other again. But your father never backed down from that promise... to chase his dreams. You did, too, uncle Charlie. Ally... I'm telling you this because if you're doing something out of an obligation, and not because it's your dream... That's not what your father or me or any of us want. And between the two of us... I think Sally Ann is more than capable of running the store. And I think it's her dream to do just that. But first things first. We have to get hold of the property manager, A.S.A.P. 'Kay. I texted. I left messages. She knows I'm gonna be in Minneapolis tomorrow. I mean... Do I just let it go? Forget about her? You know, when I lost your aunt Rae... I closed my heart. And now I'm hearing you talk about Alice, and I'm thinking, "maybe I made a mistake". Hey, no, uncle N. Well, no, no, no, no. Listen to me. I've been afraid to love again because I didn't want to lose again. We lost your parents and Rae and Eddie, but we had them, and I think the best way of honoring their memory is to say loving them was worth it, even if we didn't have them for that long. Got to grab love when you get the chance. You know what, why don't we drive to Minneapolis tonight? What? You can look at Alice, face to face, maybe get some answers you need. All right. All right. Let's do it. 'Twas the day before Christmas, and all through the hills, the reindeer were playing, enjoying the thrills of skating and coasting and climbing the willows and hopscotch and leapfrog, protected by pillows... The kids settled down enough for some hot chocolate? They may be passed out already. Here, let me help with this. It's okay. Just in case. You know. Mom told you. Okay, look, don't be mad. I'm fine. I can carry things. I won't trip or drop, or... I wasn't saying you're going to drop... Sorry. I should have started with... I love you. I'm sorry you're up against this. Whatever you need, me and Sal and the kids, and every single person in this family, we got your back. I know. Thank you. I mean it. Wait. Hold on. I don't know what we're doing here. This is... This is a mistake. I'm gonna do my meeting tomorrow and we'll head back. So you can pack for the move. No. No, I'm not gonna take the job. Jack. Jack, let's just talk about this. It's okay. This way, we'll always have Christmas together, you and me. Well, there's lots of ways we can work that out, but if it's something I've done, or if there's any reason you can't move back... for the last few years, everything I worked for was getting back to Minneapolis. Then Alice came along, and she... She made me realize just how much more I wanted. Not just a big life, but a full one. What I promised Eddie. That's what Minneapolis represents now, and if I can't have that with Alice... I'm gonna do this sales call. Come back and pick you up in a bit. All right. Hey! Are you my 3:30? Yeah, I was supposed to meet with Rach... el. Mickey? Jack, yeah, yeah, yeah, from the wedding. - Yeah. - How you doing? I'm good, thanks. Well, Rachel went on maternity leave two weeks early, but she filled me in before she left, so take a seat, we can talk. They went for it. The Skyway guys. Coffee bar, inside the shop. Best of both worlds. They're gonna lease the space to us! We'll get the paperwork done by January 15th, renovate, and we'll be up and running by spring! Yes! With Sally Ann in charge. Wait. Wait. What? With Sally Ann in charge. I'll stay on as long as needed and tell you everything I know, and once we get everything running smoothly, uncle Charlie retires, you take over, and I bow out. This is your dream. It's not mine. So ring it out loud. Yes, I mean, if you really... like, if you both... Then... Yes. Yes! Yes! I have to call Mick. And you be whoever you want to be. We're all here for you. Mom told you. Of course. That's not why I'm saying it. You deserve to love whatever you do with your whole heart, the way your father and I did, and the way Sally Ann does. Thank you. That sounds terrific. I'll coordinate with Rachel, but I think we can fit a new imaging-machine suite into our budget. Thanks. That's amazing. And... Tell Alice, Merry Christmas. And happy holidays to you and the family. Wait, Jack. She didn't call you? I don't think she's interested anymore. You got to know, she is nuts about you. I'm nuts about her, but she... She won't return my calls and... I saw her with someone else last night. Last night? I was... I was just trying to get her to at least talk to me. Last night, she was at this Christmas Eve-Eve movie-watching thing at her place with me and Sal and the kids. That was you...? Of course it was! Outside her house. But why is she... Jack. Alice may kill me for this, but... You need to hear what's going on with her. Hey, Mickey. Yeah. I'm just here with your dad. We're dropping off some dinner at Alice's place. Perfect, stay there. I just called Sal and told her to send Alice home for a made-up emergency. What's going on? Marina family, all-hands-on-deck. Olga... we've got a plan. Mom? Hey, what's going on? Your landlord called me and said that you had... You had an emergency. An emergency? Yeah... Gas leak. A gas leak! Gas leak. Hey. I wasn't expecting you yet. Is everything all right? I'm not sure yet. What's going on? A Hail Mary. Hail Mary? All right. Okay... okay. Okay, so here's what's going to happen. Okay, he's not picking up. And I don't smell any gas. Seriously, my landlord called you both? Who's tha... Mickey? Hey! How you doing? Have you seen the snow? It is beautiful! You should come check it out. What? What are you... Okay... Mickey, what's going on? I think there's a message for you. I can't believe that you... Please, don't say anything. Alice Marina, from the moment we met, my heart was yours. Jack. MS doesn't change the way I feel about you. It just doesn't. But you shouldn't be obligated to take care of me. We've only known each other for a few weeks. The best weeks of my life. And I'm not obligated. I want to take care of you. And you're gonna take care of me. That's just how it works! Caring for my brother made me a better human being. He showed me that... Being there for someone, loving someone, is about all the things you do with them, not just the easy ones. Whatever you're going through, I want to be there for you, with you, to help you through it, to help you, no matter what happens. Jack. Eddie wanted my life to be full and rich and matter, and it does, when I'm with you. I don't want to lose you, Alice. I don't want to lose you, Jack. But if you're standing in front of me, who was holding up the signs? That would've been me. Everyone, this is Jack's uncle Nabeh. - "Nabeh?" - Hello. This is my mother, Olga, and my cousin Mickey... Did you say Nabeh? Nabeh Totah? Charlie? Charlie? No, no, no, no. Nabeh! Charlie! It's so good to see you! All this time! You're Alice's uncle. You're Jack's uncle. You two know each other? Nabeh is the boy on the boat I told you about, Alice. No! There is so much godwinking going on around here right now! Now, if you'll excuse us, we have a few things to catch up on. That we do. Nice to meet you. - We're gonna get out of here. - Okay. Love you. You wore the tie. I did. Are you, gonna answer that? No. We're almost underneath it. Yeah. I love you, Alice. I love you, too, Jack. The real Alice and Jack danced at their wedding, as uncles Charlie and Nabeh reunited a 50-year friendship. Alice did become a professional counselor, and has managed her MS with the loving support of her family. Today they encourage you to look for your godwinks. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
