Then you start your shift with a ten minute break in the bathroom? We're done. -I… -No, I'm done. -Roger, you don't wanna do this. -No, no, no. -I can find someone else. -What is the store, without you and me? -You never change. I'm tired. -I mean… Okay. Okay, let me prove it to you. -You know, no more excuses. -Oh my God! -No more being late. -She never stops. Please. Stop it. I don't know why you do this. You lose at this game every time. Alright. I guess we can go one more day. Thank you! -Thank you. -But no more bullshit. From now on, I mean it. I don't wanna hear any more of this, you know, I couldn't start my car. You know, I had to take the cat to the dentist. You know, I fell asleep on the bus. From now on, you'll be on time. You'll be above reproach. -You're gonna be… -Responsible. Responsible! That's shit, okay. One more fuck up and you're done. Hello? -Hey, I-- -Gotcha! Can't get to the phone right now so just leave me a message, or don't. Peace -Hey -Hey. You guys look like you would like some magic. -Oh, magic! -Yes. Okay, so. Keep your eye on this red ball. Pop in here. What?! That's so cool. Let's go in here and see if they have a princess dress for Sarah. I want a balloon. -Could you? -Yeah, no, for sure. Do you mind watching him for a minute while I run in real quick? -Actually, I… -Thank you. Stay here with the nice balloon lady. Be careful, little prince. If you pop them all, you'll turn into a frog. Sorry, I don't make the rules. Make me Spider-man. How about a flower? -Boring. Those are for girls. -Dude, no. Princes love flowers. How about a sword? A sword for a brave knight like you? -Fine. -Yes! Okay. Sword it is. Okay, here's your sword. Tell your mom tips are appreciated. Oh, this is awesome. A wiener! Mom, look! -Ma'am it's a sword! -I got a wiener! You little shit. It does look like a sword, doesn't it? Just gimme your jacket. Please, Roger I… Look, I don't wanna hear it. I got bills to pay. -Yeah. -Right? I got a rent increase. You know, I have online competition. I gotta put up with all of that. -Yeah. -You know what I need is is a good, responsible employee. Not some grown up kid. Roger, I just found out I'm… I'm pregnant. That's good. You haven't used that one before. And you know what, how dare you?! Okay. I can prove it to you. No, just gimme the jacket. It was here just a second ago, okay? -Just gimme one, second… -You don't understand. You're fired. -I'll put your check in the mail. -Whatever. Dumb! Hello? We are closing. Our regular office hours are Monday to Friday, nine to six. Saturday by appointment only. Right, I just really need to see a doctor. Do you have an appointment? No. I'm sorry, you'll have to come back on Monday, unless it's an emergency. You can call, or go online to schedule an appointment. Right, but I think that I'm probably pregnant, so that means I need to see a doctor, like right now. Hello? No! Oh no, she's coming back again! Hello, there's been an emergency out here-- We are closed. Right, but there's an emergency with my breast. I think I have lumps. -I wake up vomiting and I'm… -I don't have enough time for this. I'm very nauseous all the time. -I'm dizzy sometimes… -Ma'am stop. -Sometimes I feel very lumpy. -Dizzy? Okay, ma'am. -It's okay, you can just-- -What if it's breast cancer, sir? -Ma'am, stop it. -What if… I can see you. Look over here. Yeah hey, you were just here. And honestly, you really need to work on that British accent, come on. What if something is really wrong? I don't wanna die. Hey, doc, can you take one last person please? Okay. Today's office visit could range from 30 dollars to 250 dollars, depending on what the doctor recommends. A typical uninsured visit is 470 dollars. -Do you have health insurance? -No. Okay. Obamacare, Medicare maybe? I missed those deadlines. Alright. You may benefit from a federal support program. Let's see. Do you have a job? Yes. No. Yes or no? Not anymore. Okay, no job. No health insurance, Jesus. Do you have any dependents? Outside of yourself do you care for anyone? -A child, parents? -Right. No, it's just me. Alright. Alright, do you make more than 17,237 dollars per year? That is so specific. I… I think… -No! -Okay. -No, I am very poor. -Smart choice. Alright, you're good. You don't have to pay today. Take a seat and fill out the intake paperwork. -Hey, Mom, I can't really talk right now. -Hi sweetie. How are you? -Yeah, no, I'm good, just… -Are you still at work? Yep. Just making some balloons. Listen, I just wanna know if we'll have the honor of seeing you tomorrow? Cherry? What's the plan tomorrow? Mother's Day. Did you forget? No, no. I mean, how could I forget your special day? Your sister's in town. I'd appreciate if you two didn't fight for once. Okay. Hey, Cherry. Yeah, mom I gotta go. -It's Grandma's recipe. -Take your time. -It's been cooking for hours. -Yeah, I know. I really gotta go. -Okay, sweetie. -Yeah, okay. -Love you. -See you tomorrow. That's for you… I'm so sorry about that. Come on. Hands! Come on. Yeah, just… I'll see you in five minutes. Okay, see you soon. Bye. -Have a seat. -Her paperwork. Thank you. Alright, so, Cherry, you have a pain in the breast. So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give you a robe. You're gonna put that on. I'm gonna come back in a few moments, okay? -Right, so I… -Here you go. -Can I come in? -Yeah. Okay, arms up. Yeah, you could put that away. Arms up, I'm just gonna take this down. Alright? And I'll do the examination part, I'm just gonna start here. Do you ever self-examine your breasts? -No. -Okay. Does your family have a history of breast cancer? I don't think so. Well, you should know. It's a good thing to know. Have you discussed this with your mom? We don't really talk about stuff like that. You should. It's important to know what kind of illnesses run in your family. Gives you a lot of good insight for the future. Okay, arms down. I can tell you that your breast exam is healthy and normal. -I think that we can just… -Hey… -Yeah? -Sorry to interrupt. I need your signature for the labs. Okay, you can get dressed and I'll be right back, okay? Weird little alien. Okay, so I am gonna print out your medical report, and then I can go, finally. -I mean you can go, and you can take this. -Right. So, I'm pregnant. I think. That's actually the reason why I'm here. Also, I'm sorry for lying, but I took my test this morning, but then I lost it at work and it said positive, but the box said 99% accuracy. And if I am that 1%, I mean, that is so on brand for me. -Well, you know, honestly, Cherry to be… -I… they say that just to avoid lawsuits, okay? Those tests are fairly accurate. Okay, well, let's just start over. We'll begin with your health history. And… Okay, so which contraceptive method do you use? -We go with pulling out. -Pulling out? Withdrawal. That's the least effective contraceptive method. It doesn't prevent against STDs either. Yeah, I know. I was on the pill off and on, but I just don't like taking drugs every day. -I mean, hormonal ones. -When was your last period? So, it's weird. I thought that I had something a few weeks ago. But, my boobs were really sore and I just kept thinking that my period would hit. And then I waited a week, and then two, and then I was too scared to take a test and now I am here so. Okay. Have a seat. Okay? The gel is a little cold. Okay… -You alright? -Yep. No, this is not weird at all. It's not. Let's see what we have. Well, we have something. You're definitely pregnant. -Oh my God! -And… You are ten weeks. -Ten weeks?! -To be exact. How is that even possible? Well, we calculate it from the first day of your last period. So, right now you're entering your 11th week. And the fetus, just so you know, it's about the size of a big raspberry. You mentioned that you had your last period at the beginning of March. Is that right? Yeah, I think so. So, that means you would've gotten you… oh, you would've gotten pregnant around March 17th. St. Patrick's Day. That was Nick's birthday. It did get a little wild. So, unfortunately you don't have a lot of time to make some big decisions. You know, for an abortion by pill, you only have 24 hours. Oh God! Can I see it? Okay. What's it sound like in there? Are you sure? You don't have to. Yeah. I'm terrified. I mean… the idea of a future potential human just like swimming around inside of me, is really, really scary. But then I was thinking about it and… it's kind of like a superpower. Okay, well, have you shared this news with anyone in your life? Dad? Oh my God! My dad is like… -the last person. -No, no, not your dad. The father. -The father. -Right. Nick. -What would you do? -What I'd do? I don't think you should be asking me that. I'm not the one sitting there pregnant. Yes you know what I mean. Yeah. So, outside of a boy, or a girl… -what are my options? -You have two options, right now. If you choose to do nothing, you're gonna have a baby to take care of in a few months. Okay? If you decide not to go forward, here in California, you have until 11 weeks for an abortion by pill, until 24 weeks for surgical abortion and it's a more costly, and it's a heavier procedure. That's it. Yeah. I just never thought this would be me. You know? I mean, there's nothing wrong with it. It's just… -It's other girls that get abortions. -I know. It's not on our bucket list of things to do in life. I get you. Just so you know, an abortion by pill is similar to a miscarriage and it costs 500 dollars. -Five-hundred bucks?! -Yes. But you don't have to worry, 'cause health insurance covers most of it. Okay and… you don't have it. Cherry… having a baby, it can be a beautiful thing. Trust me. But it'll change your life. Turn it right upside down. But it'll make me an adult, right? Not necessarily. Listen, you just have to think about it. You gotta take your time. You gotta make this decision yourself. What I can do for you is just make an appointment… to come back Monday and you can tell me what you decide and we can just take it from there. How's that? -Yeah. -Okay? Promise me you'll come? -I promise. -Good. Can't get to the phone right now. So just leave me a message, or don't. Peace! Hey Nick, please call me back. We need to talk. Where the fuck are you? Hey, guys. Hey, Cherry. Long time no see. Yeah. You know how it goes. You guys are looking good, new outfits. What is she doing here? What the hell?! Cherry, what are you doing here? I wasn't expecting you anymore. Yeah I know, I'm sorry I'm late. Late? Yeah. I mean, I'd say you're pretty damn late. Where were you for the bat mitzvah and the baby shower? Look, I am sorry for being MIA, but I'm here now and ready to roll. Dude, it's been weeks. I thought you weren't interested in being part of our group anymore. No, of course I am. I just, I got busy, you know? Right. I'm sure you're real busy with what's his face. -Magic Nick! -No, stop. Don't be jealous, you know I love you more. Well, I hate you. Hey, can we talk just for a second? Yeah. Hey, I was actually just about to make an announcement. You're gonna love it. Can I go first? -Yeah. -Okay, cool. So, I just got the results for our submission for the Sunshine Summer tour… and it looks like we got it! -Oh my God! -Yes! We'll be touring all across the US and Europe for six months. You guys did amazing. Rehearsals start next week. You guys rock. Thank you for all your hard work. Now let's rock. Yes! Yes! -That is crazy. I mean… -I know… why didn't you tell me you submitted us? I mean, when? You weren't here. -Like… -Yeah, no totally. -Tour, I mean. -Yeah… Cherry, this is the start of something huge. I can feel it, we did this. Yeah, yeah we did. Why do you look like you just lost a roller contest in the eighth grade? It's just a big surprise, that's all. I mean, it's amazing. Great. Cherry, you're starting to scare the shit outta me. Please don't let me down, not now. Dude, I'm not gonna let you down. I just… I don't know, I need to think about it. There's nothing to think about. Listen, we're about to start. -Can we put a pin on this? -Yeah, totally. Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. You can't perform tonight. What? We have all new choreography and all new outfits. You can't wear this. I'm sorry. Here, why don't you just take a seat, -catch up for next time? -Yeah. Okay. -Sorry. -It's all good. Hey, you catch the moves? Yeah, totally. Are you okay? Something seems off. Yeah. No… I got fired today. So, that's a bummer. Again? You really know how to make a girl feel better. -No, I'm sorry, but I mean… -It's fine. you weren't planning on being a clown the rest of your life, were you? -We have talked about this. -Okay. I'm a magician, not a clown and there is a difference. I'm sorry. -It's okay. -Hey, that sucks. But, hey, at least you don't have to quit your job, because I'm expecting full commitment for this tour. Yeah, I just, I don't know. I don't know if I can go on tour. What? What do you mean? I don't know, I think I wanna settle down… with Nick. What? You're just gonna throw away your passion for a fling? It's not a fling. I moved in with the dude, okay? Sorry if I have a love life. Okay, I'm sorry. -You love Nick and Nick loves you. -Yeah. I get it. But you need to figure out what you want. So, are you in, or are you out? Look at them. Do you even need me? What are you talking about? You're great. It's just, are you committed? You haven't been to practice in weeks. Look, honestly, this tour is just another gig for what a few months and then we're right back here in LA, dancing for fucking birthday parties like… So, what, you just wanna quit, give up on your dreams? That's not what I said. Like always, you never give yourself a chance do you? Things change. Dreams change and apparently, people change. Classic Cherry! Let me know when you figure out your shit! This party blows anyway. -Hey, Steph. -Hi, Cherry. -Hey, how's it going? -Hey, Cherry! How's it going? I went to the doctor Said I'm crazy for your love Wrote me a prescription… Hey stranger. Hey. I'm sorry I didn't call you back. I just kinda had a crazy day. You can't even imagine. Oh I can. My console broke down. I had to run to Lucas's and borrow his and meeting with the band and I saw your text. Is everything okay? Could we talk in private? Yeah. -Just give me one minute. -Yeah. I guess I'm falling in love Baby you're my rock star Smashing all my guitars How's everybody doing tonight? We're wrapping up this evening, so it'll slow down. Enjoy. I was tempted You come here often? Stop. Oh my God! I didn't even tell you. My manager called earlier. He wants to book me for shows all over the place. -Cool. -I know, right? And then we got the album coming out next month. It's gonna be crazy, but it's gonna be good. Yeah, totally. You alright? Yeah. What did I do? I was tempted Come, let's go. I was tempted The promises, the lies Just keep hurting They just keep on hurting… Hey, you can't be in here. No, but you can. Is this what was so urgent? Yeah. -I love when you do that. -Oh, I know. I love it too. I love you. I'm on the clock. I should probably go back out there. Okay. I'm sorry. We can do this at home. Your roommates are always around. I'm sorry. You coming back out there? -Yeah. -Okay. I'll see you out there. Great. This song is dedicated to a very special lady, Cherry. Could you watch the booth? Stick with disco. Let's talk outside. Maybe it'll be a DJ. Is this some kind of joke? 'Cause it's not funny. It's not. Are you really pregnant? -Yeah. -You're sure? I mean, the doctor seems pretty sure so, yeah. Holy fuck! Hey! It's gonna be okay. I just don't know how it happened. We're cautious, right? I always pull out. I mean, not always. Look, our families will help us, and I am gonna get a new job, a really good job. And you have a garage that we can turn into a bedroom. I have so many friends who did that in college. Cherry, Cherry, I just paid off a student loan. I work this job at night. We share a three bedroom apartment with four other dudes that smoke pot all day. I'm supposed to start my career. How are we gonna do that with a baby? We can make it work. Lifetime. This is a lifetime. This is forever. I'm not scared. I love you. It's not about that. Okay, so what's it about? I had a great dad and I wanna be a great dad. You know, I watched my dad just throw away his dreams for me? You know how that made me feel? It was absolutely pathetic. You think that's pathetic. You wanna just spend the rest of your life with your dumb band pressing buttons -and switching tracks? -My dumb band? My dumb band, you love my music. I do, I just… I know what a great dad you could be. And, like your father and I'm gonna try not to be a fucked up mom. You're gonna try not to be a fucked up mom? How the hell are you gonna do that, when you can't even afford -your own apartment, Cherry? -Excuse me? It's just not a good idea. Okay. I don't want to have a kid… and I especially don't want to have a fucking kid with you. I like you. But this was not part of the plan. It wasn't part of my plan, sure it wasn't part of your plan. We're young. Okay, well I don't need your permission. You don't need my… What the fuck are you gonna do? -Have a baby behind my back? -Maybe. It's my body, my choice. Fuck that. Fuck you. I'm out. Nick! What's going on with the music? Two minutes, I'm coming. Keep your damn problems for yourself. Stay stoned with your roommates. Give me back the money you owe me. Asshole! Hey, Mom, it's me. Cherry is that you? On time? Going upstairs, will be right back. Okay. We're in the kitchen with your sister. Winter wings slightly Touching your soft skin There's gotta be a brighter a day A summer breeze Some silk and honey -A big wild horse is running through -A big wild horse is running through -The golden doors -The golden doors -You know you gotta take the ride -You know you gotta take the ride -It's now or never by my side -It's now or never by my side Little Daisy don't be shy Nobody changes they just lie Take your fate by the end It's time to conquer your own land Little Daisy don't be shy Nobody changes they just lie Take your own fate by the end It's time to conquer your own land Okay, everybody. Happy Sunday. Bad news. I'm signing up for unemployment. The good news though, not sterile. Father is outta of the picture. Any support on weekend? Cherry come down, help your sister set the table. Okay. Okay. Miles Frederick went from being a nice gentleman to a sexual maniac. There will be no evidence of financial… -or family motive. -Not guilty! Hi. I feel like I saw you wore that exact same outfit like when you were 12. And it's just as cute. Check out what I found. So young and already a little terror. Oh my God. Do I need to remind you this was my doll, my Dorothy. 96. Poor Dorothy. What happened to her? I think I burned her. -I think you did too. -Here. Is everything okay? You look tired, I mean, even more tired than usual. Yeah, I got knocked up by my drug dealer and I'm probably gonna live in my car for the rest of my life. -So, I'm crushing it. -Yeah. Very funny. Yeah. Work's still going well? I have like four cases simultaneously. I'm still losing my mind. I might burn the place down, but yeah, it's going great. Yeah. Well I'm sure you'll be running the place by next year. Well, sometimes I just wish I could live on love. You know, like you. Yeah. Hey, where's Grandma? She's in there. Hey, Gram. Cool shades, Grandma. What are you doing? Amanda! It's so lovely to see ya. It's Cherry, Grandma. Robert was such a handsome man. But who is this woman beside him? Oh, I don't know. You want a raspberry? They're very good for you. A lot of vitamins. Grandma, can you keep a secret? Sure. Mom, do you need help? I'm pregnant. Again, at your age? Again? Definitely a first. I can't stop thinking about it. You know, it's like… is it gonna be a boy, or a girl? Or both. You know, maybe a baby will gimme something to focus on. Yeah. -Yeah. -Yeah? No. You think I'll go to hell if I get rid of it? I mean, I was probably going there anyway. I just wish I could talk to future me. She would tell me what the fuck to do. Amanda, at your age, the first time I knew I was pregnant, I didn't eat for 20 days. That's a very long time. It didn't work. But, Grandma, then we wouldn't be here. Well, I would've had a different life. I would've been fine with that too. Yeah, I would've been-- Cherry, Mom, lunch is ready. Come and get it. We should go before she thinks you're abducted. Oh, you know, I once had an affair with a woman, -but don't tell Robert. -Seriously? I used to be a rock star Okay. The prettiest girl on the road star My heart was full of sparks And we're dancing… My hands full of light I was the queen of the moon star I wonder what kind of crap she has up today. -Anyhow, Bon appetite. -Of course. Robert loved New Year's Eve. It's Mother's Day, Mom. We always had our special time. -Oh! -When the kids were off to sleep. Okay, Mom, that's great. Have some bread. -Happy Mother's Day, Mom. -Thank you honey. Mom told me your room is gonna be an Airbnb. Yeah. Yeah, Cherry's almost done packing… and I think the extra money would come in handy, because I'm still negotiating with Mom's retirement home. Yeah. Not that I'm in any rush to see Grandma go away, but I raised two lovely daughters and I'm done with diapers. -So, time for a little time to myself. -Yeah. That's a good idea. So you're gonna move in with this boyfriend? So, actually I think, -What do you mean? -I might do… Okay, Cherry, are you gonna move back in? I'm sorry you stayed for like ever at Jeffrey's parents. That was different because I was an intern -in New York, right? -In New York. -Yeah. -Yeah, okay. You don't know how expensive rent is in New York. -It's very expensive. -So, why don't you just move back to LA? Okay, well then, why don't you just stop making everything -about you? -You're too good for LA? Alright girls, cut it out. For once we're all together. Let's just have a peaceful day. Okay? Anna, don't tease your sister. Not everyone has the chance to go to law school. -Sure. -And, Cherry. Your sister's right. It's time to stand on your own two feet. It is. It's literally a figure of speech. You didn't have to stand up. I have something to say. Who's dead? No one's dead, Mom. Cherry, are you coming out, to us right now? I just broke up with my boyfriend actually. -His name is Nick. -Oh, honey. Was Nick. Is Nick. We are not together anymore. And also, I quit my job at the costume shop. But to look for something better. A real job, a good job, maybe even your job and… oh my God, okay. To be honest, I am not doing very well right now. I feel like kind of lost and… but you know, I'm gonna figure it out. I'm figuring it out on my own, right now. Also, another very important thing that I have to say is… can you please stop? I'm trying to do something. Oh my gosh, pumpkin. What's wrong? I'm sorry, I'm just not doing well either. Oh, what's the matter, sweetie? -You know, Jeffrey and I, we've been… -Yeah. Well… What? We've been… What, honey? Oh my God. I can't get pregnant. -I can't get pregnant. -Oh, sweetie. Oh, honey. I had no idea that you and Jefferey were trying to have a baby. Oh, we've been trying for months! And… I took some herbal pills -my friend referred to me. -You know what? -Never mind. -And I'm like… -What's going on? -changing my diet… Mother's Day drama for everyone. -I know how to cheer them up. -It doesn't happen right away. Of course it doesn't. It's just… -I feel like it should, you know? -The minute… The minute you stop stressing about it, that's when it-- Oh my God. Happy New Year! Okay, well so much for that. Ya? Did you and dad have have that problem getting pregnant? Being preg, getting, oh, no. -Not at all. -Yeah. You know, I think she just is stressed out. I think she's just working too hard. -Mom, did you know about me? -Or, you know what? -It could have been Jeffrey. -Did you know about me? What about you? If I was a boy, or a girl? Oh, honey, well, you were definitely supposed to be a boy, until you popped out a girl. Surprise! Well, surprise for me. Your father showed up two hours late. So, what was it that you wanted to talk about? If it's money, honey, you know, I already told you I've helped you -as much as I can. -It's not always about money. Okay, okay. Well, is it the boyfriend? -It's not always boys either. -You know what my mom always says… Grandma always says, "After trains and after men never run. There's always one coming later". I know. What is it? Babe? Could I just stay here, for a couple days? It's just until I find another place. I really, really don't wanna stay with Nick and, I don't know, I could help Grandma. Take her on some walks or, to the ballroom. I know she misses dancing. You wanna help, really? Yeah. Well, I'm not gonna let you sleep in the street, honey. Of course you can stay. Thanks. And since you wanna make yourself useful, bring that to the neighbor. They'll be happy to see you. Let's kick your sister out of her mess. Hot pie! On it. So, what happened? I don't really know. I think she was making like a weird noise, so I stopped and she just wouldn't turn back on. Maybe it's the battery. Let's see. You know, I can't believe that old bug is still running. I remember your grandma in it. Need some help? No, I'm fine. It's sunny. Yeah, it's hot. So, what's up? Same, same. I gotta check it. For that you gotta pay She said she would fix my body You love this song. I know you love this song. You used to play it all the time. Squeezed me till I popped She said she would keep it coming Till she heard me holler stop Doctor Juice! Come on. You feel it a little bit. You are crazy, you know that? Okay, that's enough. We're good. Hey, wait. Dad. How about some fruit? No, I'm good. Didn't you have lunch with your mom? Well, yeah, but I didn't have dessert. Yeah, I gotta go. I'm out of time so. Do you really wanna go back to work? There's a coconut with your name on it, please. Alright, quick. What happened? Hey. What would you like to have? A passion fruit salad, please. I'll have a fresh coconut. Can we sit over there? -Yes, please. -Great. Here you go. So, Mom said you were expecting a boy with me. What? You didn't know I was gonna be a girl. Oh, yeah right. Were you disappointed? What do you mean? I mean, you wanted a boy, right? I, you know, I… would've liked a boy. But, I'm happy with you two girls. You get what you get. Yeah. So, when did you know you wanted to be a dad? Wait, what is this, like "50 questions"? I mean, did you and Mom just like wake up one day -and you were like "Let's have babies". -I don't know. It happened, when it had to happen. Right. What? I dunno. I just… It seems like sometimes you don't really care. How can you say that? I… I raised you. I take care of the household. I worked hard. That's not what I mean. You know, I'm always here for you to move your stuff and be your mechanic. And, you know, you're still alive. So, I think I did a pretty good job as a parent. Yeah, totally. But you never call. I just, I don't like talking on the phone, that's all. But you don't know anything about me. I mean, you don't know where I live, or what I do, or even the name of my boyfriend-- Of course I do. Steven. Nick. Steven was like two years ago. And Nick doesn't even matter. We broke up. You won't meet him. And I lost my job, so I'm a real winner. I didn't know you had a new job. The costume shop. Oh, okay. Look, maybe I wasn't the best father, but, you know, things were not easy for me. Times were tough. And you'll see when you get married and you have kids. You know, there will be so many moments that you want to give up. But I didn't give up. I'm still here for you girls. -You know you were wanted, -Yeah… right? I really gotta get back to work. Yeah. Here, there's some cash in there. I'm gonna use the bathroom next door, I'll be right back. -Three dollars please. -Thank you. Thank you so much. Cherry, let's go. Thanks. Thanks for the help. You're welcome. Bye. Thank you. In this world I live in I can make it or lose In this cold cold night I can fall and get a bruise In the lights of the night I can reach up to the sky But if you were the one Who tried to take my light I won't let you roll me In your darkest mud 'Cause if you are winning I can't count on my luck I am light I am power Though I don't look like that I'm stronger 'cause I'm loved And you'll never beat that If I lose, nothing to lose Only God knows where I'm at If I choose, nothing to choose Anyway it's not my bet If I cruise down the dark street Running from the evil on my back I hope there maybe will be But there maybe will be Someone good… Hey, sis. Just wanted you to know, I think you're gonna be an amazing mom one day… and I'm gonna be a kick ass aunt, so. I'm here, you know, if you ever need to talk, I'm here for you. And be ready for my next trip to New York, because I really wanna come and visit you. Okay, well I love you. Bye. If I lose, nothing to lose Only God knows where I'm at If I choose, nothing to choose Anyway it's not my bet If I cruise down the dark street Running from the evil on my back I hope there maybe we'll be But there maybe will be But there maybe will be Now I have lost Everything that seemed important And I will walk Seeming maybe a little ignorant -Hi, babe. -You can't call me that anymore. What do you want? You didn't pick up your phone. I thought maybe you needed it. Thanks. Okay, what are you actually doing here? I'm sorry, for the other night. If you're gonna have the baby, I'm not gonna force you to do anything. Look, I don't have the answers but… we'll figure it out. We'll… We'll get real jobs and our own apartment and… I'll stop the music. It's never a good time to become a parent, right? You don't have to convince yourself… or me. I'm not keeping it. You sure? Yeah. I know I wanna be a mom. Just, not right now. So… Okay. I guess that's what being an adult is. You know, deciding what's best for me. Sounds pretty responsible. So, who are you and what have you done with Cherry? What are you gonna do now? I have an appointment at ten. Do you… do you want me to come? Thanks, but no, I'm good. So… what about us? Are we together still, or? I mean, were we really? I mean, are people just together to get married and have kids? I don't know. We definitely have a shit ton to learn and do first though. You more than me. Debatable. Okay. I will be over to your place to pick up my stuff tonight. You can stay as long as you want. I promise. No, I'm good. I actually wanna spend some time with my family. Up to you. You dumped me but… I'm still here for you Cherry. Hey. When you're a big shot, don't forget about me. See you around. Wow. For once you're on time. Shocker, I know. Let me guess, you want your job back? Well, it's not gonna happen. I'm permanently shutting down everything. Downsizing. I actually was hoping to get my paycheck. Well, it's not ready yet. Next week. Yeah, I know. It's just, I kind of need the money asap, if possible in cash. I found this in the alley, on the ground. Look familiar? Yes, I think I recognize this magic wand. I'm sorry, I didn't believe you. It's okay. It actually doesn't even matter anymore. So, what are you gonna do? Get back on track if it's not too late. Wait, you're not gonna go to work for the online competition, are you? I would never. -Okay… -So, about the cash Oh, just one minute. I'll get it. Here you go. -Thank you. -Be careful with that. I will. Put it to good use. Thank you. I'm gonna miss you, Missy. I'm gonna miss you too. I'm gonna miss this store. Yeah. I'll miss it too. Thanks. Oh, take the balloons with you. I'm shutting down the stand too. Take the stand, take it all! I'm on it. You, look like you could use a balloon. Thanks. Oh wait, you guys definitely need a balloon. What? That's so cute. Thank you.
