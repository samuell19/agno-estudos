Shilong, Dongguan Was it any different that year? I couldn't understand what you said that day. The unforgettable days... are the faint memories of my home. In your diary, you said... I looked like a little child seeing the world. But the sky above the canopy... was it any different that year? I couldn't understand what you said that day. Sis, stop giving me food. I'm on a diet. You're already so thin and you're dieting? Mum, don't you know? Kai Mui wants to be a model. Will you stop speaking our dialect to her? Your Cantonese is poor. Don't set a bad example for your sister. Don't worry. Her Cantonese is excellent. Wong Kai Mui, what did she do? What happened? Why didn't you say anything? Don't you know she may die? You'd better stop the bleeding first or she may die, like you said. - Are you Wong Kai Mui? - Yes. I'm Miss Mak, the school's social worker. How would you like me to address you? Do you have an English name? K-A-M-A. Kama. I know most of the ninth graders but I don't know you. You must be a very quiet girl. Although your grades are good... some teachers feel that you don't like them. I can feel that they don't like me either. You wrote something in your Facebook. I turned on the lights and saw that the bed was covered with blood. The two of us were like pigs at an abattoir, rolling on the bed. That was my first time. That was my ex-boyfriend in Dongguan. We'd broken up. Dongguan? You've been in Hong Kong for a year. You've just turned sixteen... Can you tell me why you saw your classmate slitting her wrists... but didn't tell Miss Woo? I was terrified. Why did she cut herself with a knife? What is it, Officer Chong? - Did you steal his girlfriend? - How could you tell? I heard the rumours. Let's go! - You forgot your phone. - Yes... The last person to see the victim is Teng Jee Chung. He hasn't been home since last night. We've found the landlord. The Identification Bureau has examined the room under black light. There are bloodstains all over the floor. Are there witnesses? There's an old lady. Why don't you take a break first? If you recall anything, tell us right away. Okay? Mr Teng. Hey, help me take a picture. - What of? - Of me. - Of you? - Let me do it. OK. Seeking Mui I can't do it. Help me out... What's up? I'm picking up the goods. Stamp the receipt and give it back to me. Hurry up! You walk so slowly. I need to use the toilet. Toilet? I haven't settled the score with you. The customers have complained... that the meat has gone bad by the time you deliver to them! Move it! Come on, move it! Get out of here! Where are you from? What? I asked where you're from! This morning, the police found pools of blood... in an apartment in Sham Shui Po. The police believe someone was murdered there... and that the victim was a woman. The male tenant is now wanted by the police. Boy boy, no PlayStation. Finish summer homework first. See you tonight. - Are you very free? - Madam Law. Chong, do you need to work so hard? - What? - Are you trying to get yourself fired? How's the murder case coming along? The victim Wong Kai Mui, aged sixteen, is from Hunan. Her mother remarried seven years ago. They couldn't get a Hong Kong visa so they moved to Shilong in Dongguan... where her stepfather has relatives living nearby. Besides, it's close to Hong Kong... which would make it convenient for her mum to visit. A year ago, she immigrated to Hong Kong. She quit school before completing ninth grade. She was said to be working as an assistant at a modelling company... but she was actually a social escort. She was killed during sex with a customer. Her flesh was chopped up and flushed down the toilet. The killer ripped the skin off her face... and carted her bones to the market at Shek Kip Mei. Brilliant. So you've solved the case? The killer, Teng Jee Chung, aged twenty-nine, claims to be... a delivery driver, a triad member... and sells bootleg cigarettes on the side. He had never met the victim prior to their fatal encounter. There was no history of any conflict. It's suspected he might have taken ketamine before having sex... and committed the murder under the influence of the drug. Don't smoke in my house! You cops think you can do whatever you want? She's always dreaming of becoming a movie star or a model. She should take a look in the mirror. She looks just like that wretched dad of hers! So what if she's tall? I don't know who she hangs out with. She's always going out in the middle of the night. She's even taking birth control pills. I bet she's seeing some boy outside. Fine! Don't ever come back! Ma'am, the test results are out. Your daughter might very well have been murdered. You mean my daughter is dead? What the hell are you saying? - Sir. You're here at the right time. - Dead? That's all you can say? - Go talk to that lady. - DPC 51334? She refuses to cooperate and insists her daughter is still alive. You're nuts! She's not insisting, she's desperately hoping. What do you want me to do? Force her to accept the fact that her daughter is dead? Don't smoke so much. Well, you need not call the Missing Persons Unit every day. They've transferred the case to us at the Regional Crime Unit. You're luckier than many others. In Hong Kong, one person goes missing every hour on the average. Many parents are left wandering if their child is alive or dead for years. Hello, May. Chef, I wish I could take off my top and cool off like you do. You can do it too. Go play with yourself. Why don't you join me? - Hello, Manager. - May. Mr Ma kept asking when you're starting work. He's not my paymaster, is he? May, you're here at last. Come on, let's dance. I can't dance. I need to work. Are you shy? How do you spell "shy"? I don't even know. Goodbye, my love. Goodbye, my love. I don't know when we'll meet again. I've given you everything. I hope you'll cherish it. Don't let me down. You're still awake? What are you doing? Sisters' bonding time? It's so hot... With all the lights on, of course you feel hot. Turn them off, Uncle's sleeping. Kai Mui, remember the earrings Auntie Har gave us? They actually belonged to her daughter. She took them and gave them to me as a gift. Don't tell me she's so cheap to want them back? Why not? She got you a similar pair. I don't want it. Throw them away yourself then. Don't be like that, Kai Mui. - Come here. - What is it? What's with the attitude? How have I offended you? Those earrings don't belong to you! We're poor, suck it up! I've bought you everything you wanted. You wanted to go online and I spent HKD$3,000 for a computer. Do you think I have a fortune stashed away somewhere? Stop it, Mum. Go take a bath. Which card did you toss? Dots. - Five Dots. - You're so daring. Five Dots? Do you know what you're doing? Four Bamboo. May, I need to talk to you. Hey, stand in for me. - May. - What is it? Remember the pair of earrings I gave you for your birthday? Actually they belonged to my daughter. She has been looking for them. They're really expensive. I'd given them to my daughter. You're not asking me to get them back, are you? I've brought you a similar pair. Can you exchange them with Kai Mui? Are these knockoffs? They are just kids. It makes no difference to them. If it makes no difference, give this to your daughter instead. Are they really expensive? It cost over four grand. All right. I'll get them back for you tomorrow. Hey, Fatty. What are you doing here? I'm going to the Regional Crime Unit. - Register here first. - Okay. - Write down the reason you're here. - I came to turn myself in. - What did you do? - I killed someone. Do you know there are very serious consequences to what you just said? You may go to jail for life for that. I'm only speaking the truth. This isn't the guy. You don't have to tell us if he's not. Could it be this guy? Definitely not. He's the one. He has a tattoo of an owl. - Hey, Prodigy Hoi! - Hi! After him! What the hell? We're the police! Fah, watch the car. It's illegal to park here. Stop! Son of a gun! Move out of the way. He's gone! - Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you. Open the door. Police! Open up! Calm down. We're just here looking for someone. It has nothing to do with you. That might just go off, Officer. Shut up. Come out. - Let's go! No looking around! - Which gang do you belong to? I'll send someone to say hello to your boss later. The first game paid more than 200%. It's a good deal for sure. Trust me. Thank you, Boss. Okay, sure. That's it then. Bye. Wolfsburg is definitely "lose-burg." Hoi, you're doing well, eh? Are you talking to me? Of course, Hoi. This is the police station. Officer, I thought I was very discreet... but you could still tell I'm doing illegal betting? Amazing! What is this about? Many of your colleagues are my clients. It's not like illegal betting is a felony. I won't answer any questions before my lawyer is here. To betray one's buddies is taboo among gang members. It's a murder, for goodness sake! No one is stupid enough to turn himself in. Officer, you look familiar. You smoke red Marlboro, right? - Have you bought from me before? - To hell with you! Yes... he left his violin at the teacher's place. Yes. Go and bring it back. Bring it back. It's a violin, not an aeroplane. What are you doing? Beating up a suspect? Madam, he's a witness. Smokey, I'd told you to watch your superior. Where's Smokey? Sorry, I didn't recognise you when I walked past earlier. What happened, Chong? One-on-one? Why is he the only one hurt? Now you know who's a better fighter. Have you called for an ambulance? I'm good. These are just scratches. Not for you. It's for the guy inside. Yes, we had. We'd checked. The factory that makes counterfeit credit card belongs to Wo Kay. I'll say you went there on an informant's tip-off. Otherwise, we'll never hear the end of it. - Thanks. - You're welcome. You'd better stop once you've collected enough evidence. Even if your guys are willing to go on, spare a thought for yourself. If you go on like that, you may not get another promotion. Finish your report and let me have it by five o'clock. Yes, madam. The ban on smoking in the workplace has taken effect. How much longer before the ambulance will be here? Has Teng Jee Chung ever mentioned his mother before? She died when he was still a little boy. Hell, I really want to get laid! Crazy twerp. Just wank off. I've done so much of that my prostate is getting inflamed. That reminds me. Why didn't you get some porn DVDs when you're in Mongkok? We could all use with some. Why are you leering at my mum's photo? I know what you're thinking. Stay away from my mum's photo. Try me. I'll take it then, thank you. Darn! - Bloody horndog...! - Careful, or I might drop it! You want to wank off? I'll help you with that! Come on... Bloody horndog. I'm just borrowing it. Go to hell. What about his dad? They rarely talk to each other. His girlfriend? Girlfriend? That's Mo Yung. She's not his girlfriend. Miss, do you need help? No. Fatty's van has broken down. That's a lot of stuff. Yes, I'm moving house and changing boyfriends at the same time. Really? Will you give me your number so I can help the next time you move? That's not necessary. Thanks. Don't worry. I'm a police officer. And I'm a good citizen. All right, take care. I can't stand those morons who fall over themselves, trying to flirt. Fatty Teng drives an old van. He has a hot temper which cost him several jobs already. He scrimps and saves just to buy her stuff. I'd told him there's no such thing as a free lunch. Free lunch? I mean, there's no such thing as bedding a woman for free, mister. Bedding a woman, I see. So can I have your phone number? You already have it when I called you earlier. So, B is here. Granny, I'll bring him back to you later. No hurry. It's occupied. What are you doing? Quick, open the door! What are you doing? Are you a peeping Tom? What is it? What is it? What are you doing? I thought it was a junkie inside! Forget it. You know each other? - She's really hot. - Shut up. - Shut up! - All right... Go back in. I said, go back in. - What's happening? - Go back in! Nothing... it's all right. Let's go... - Goodnight, Auntie. - Goodnight. Madam, please ask your chief to let me go. Teng called you after the murder. What did he tell you? I didn't know someone so thin can have so much fats inside. What the hell are you talking about? I heard it's easier to find whole bodies. I'm not sure we'd be able to find her head. May I tell you something not related to the case? Sure. I like to hear such things. Actually, my sister didn't quit school to help support the family. She said she wanted to make more money. - I feel that Kai Mui was a little... - Unhappy? I thought so too, but she'd never admit it. Kai Mui has changed. Ever since she came to Hong Kong, she kept everything to herself... unlike when she was little. Mum has changed a great deal too and has aged a lot... after coming to Hong Kong. If you want to speak with Uncle, meet him outside. He won't say anything in front of my mum. I've never met a witness as cooperative as you are. I feel much better after speaking with you. Can you take a picture for me? - Of us? - No, take one of me. Look through the lens here and then press the red button. - Are these yours? - They belong to my sister. My sister hit puberty earlier than most girls. But she wasn't happy with her height. Her dream was to be a model, you see. That's why she bought all these heels. (Hunan dialect) Your choice of music is too "Internet." Mum doesn't want you speaking dialect here in Hong Kong. But you speak dialect with her. (Hunan dialect) Pig skull. (Hunan dialect) You're the pig skull. Good luck for tomorrow. What's your name? Thank you. Okay. One, two, three. I heard the tabloid has paid you to do an interview. I didn't ask you to pay me. He needs to eat too. What do you want to ask? You don't have enough evidence to charge Fatty, right? - Black bean fish rice. - Great... Mr Siew, did Kai Mui ever say anything about dying? Teng Jee Chung said Kai Mui told him she wanted very much to die... and that's why he killed her. Officer, that's a difficult question. Forget it, Chief. We'll get the answer from the tabloid when it's published. You should ask Kai Mui's mum or her biological dad. Her biological dad? Yes, he does illegal betting in Hunan. Every time Manchester United loses... Kai Mui would text to congratulate him. Uncle, who do you think will win this match? - That was last night's game. - Which team won? Manchester United lost. Aren't you trying to be a model? If so, why are you idling there? Are you a star now? Stay still, Mum. Your phone rang just now. Got a text from one of your girlfriends? Not a girlfriend, it's my daughter. A long-distance daughter. Kai Mui: Congratulations, Dad. Man U lost. Dad: Good girl. Study hard and take care of yourself. Miss, do you have a moment? Would you like to be a part-time model? Sorry, I don't speak Chinese. Miss, do you have a few minutes to spare? Miss, would you like to be a part-time model? Miss, do you have a few minutes to spare? Would you be interested... Are you upset? Upset that the company didn't sign you as a model? You said yourself you'd do anything so long you're paid. We've hired you but you aren't putting in any effort. Miss, are you interested in being a part-time model? Please give me a moment... - Do you have a moment to spare? - No, thanks. Miss, may we chat for a moment? Miss, you're really pretty. You know how people can be all derisive if you say you want to be a singer? But it's different if you choose to be a part-time model. It's an easy job, you just have to dress up and pose for pictures. Why don't you be one yourself then? I'm a talent scout. Without people like us... talented individuals like you will remained undiscovered, right? I'll give you a name card. Here's your pay for today. This is it? We go by the hour. You've only worked for two hours. I can work longer. We target the lunch crowd and the evening crowd. This McDonald's meal is on me. Take it as your welcome lunch. It's more than just a job. Join the McDonald's Family. I'm full. - You're finally here. - Yes. - Have you put on weight? - It's none of your business! I thought you need the money. Why did you quit McDonald's? Your accent is all wrong. Leave her alone. She's been working at McDonald's for two months and she still can't get it right. You can't even hide the fact you're from China. Don't be mean. You found a job that pays better? That's what you really want to know, right? - I'm just asking. - I don't want to talk about it. Can't you be more sensitive to her feelings? Don't bring this up in front of her sister. She has her own difficulties. They wanted to catch Fahrenheit's concert in Taiwan... and that's how their younger cousin introduced them to the business. Your younger cousin got you into the business? She wasn't even sixteen then. She couldn't look for a job... so they found one which didn't require a job interview. Are their concert tickets so expensive? The thing was they did six concerts. Kai Mui, are you thinking of getting into the business as well? She needs money really badly. She wants to move out so she's doing two jobs now. Really? Are you serious? Sorry. Don't bother picking them up. I have more in the room. Kai Lay and I will take them to recycle and make some money. - We'll help. - Why? Are you worried we aren't strong enough? I'd rather you focus on finding more evidence... to put that son of a gun away for life. That fatty said he and my daughter took drugs together. Did he kill her because he was high on drugs? Unlikely. He's very clear on how the murder took place. The thing is we can't find the body. Do you think he's lying? I don't know. Was my daughter a... Was Kai Mui a hooker? Why are you smoking in here? Sorry. I forgot you don't allow smoking in here. Give me one. Sure... Here you go. It's a little strong. Hello? Can you be my girlfriend? Sure. Lonely Souls I can't be your actual girlfriend. Give up the idea. I lied to you just now. Once I stepped out of the hotel, I'd already forgotten you. Bye. Shall I wrap them up? No need. I'll wear them now. All right. That will be HKD$4,388. Stop Family Violence No wonder you look so familiar. That's not me. You're still denying it? I can bet my life that it's you. Look, here's another one. You're so popular. You're quite photogenic actually. There's a print advertisement suitable for you. It's a public service advertisement. Why? Are you afraid I'd catch a cold? No. Your butt is quite a distraction. I thought I got through to the next level. I died? It's my turn to play. You can't escape. Open up now. You're going to spoil the NDS. Can you give me your NDS? My sister and I both love to play. Not this one. It's a present from someone. Forget it then. How about I buy you a new one... to make up for all these sessions that I've never paid for? I'd rather not want it then. Teng Jee Chung was eight when he met with a traffic accident. His father was a truck driver plying between China and Hong Kong. Once, he brought his wife and son along for the trip. The truck flipped over and Teng watched his mum died. I'm looking through some old files now. What are you trying to do? Didn't I tell you to stop with the investigation? Why don't you take time off to be with your daughter instead? Give me one more night. I'll have the report on your desk by tomorrow morning. I'll make this clear. If you get charged for interfering in the judicial process once again... I'm not going to write another appeal letter for you. People will think we're involved or something. No one would ever think that. Why? I'm not good enough for you? Look at yourself. Your skin is sagging and you're still pretending to be young - Really? - Please. Wake up. - What time is it? - It's eight now. Good morning, madam! Needless to say, there's no report, right? It's on your desk. Fah. Yes, madam. Fix the grammar and send it to the court before ten-thirty. - Yes. - Are you tired of living? - Why are you keeping a cat here? - No. It belongs to the old lady living next to Teng Jee Chung. She had a stroke and wants us to find the cat an owner. Get Sergeant Chong to adopt it since he has no family. The cat is perfect for him. Give it to him. Are you kidding me? You want me to adopt the cat? It is quite cute. All right, I'll have you. Greet me first. Here's the information you wanted on Lay Mo Yung. Mo Yung? Who's this man? Her boyfriend. She was going to live with a very wealthy old man in the States. But she fell in love with his son. When the son got tired of her, he dumped her. Where's my ticket? Here. Look. A concert ticket only costs a few hundred bucks. Two tickets will cost one grand at most. And it's over in three hours. You think you can sleep with me for just one grand? What are you doing? Have you gone crazy? You've done a lot of research. Yes, just as you've instructed. I got a private detective to find this information. I'll leave the bill on your desk. Are you serious? Why didn't you discuss it with me first? You fell for it? I got all this information on Facebook. I don't use Facebook. Chief, you're so backward. I don't know how to help you. Fah. Can you help look at these English letters? They look like some sort of code. I'm sure it means something. Do you think I'm the FBI? It could be Chinese hanyu pinyin. Yes, it's HKD$500 for an hour; HKD$800 for two. For the first hour, we can have dinner or go for karaoke. Is this your phone number? Tonight? I'm not free tonight. - What is it? - You're blocking the wardrobe. How am I going to take my clothes to go to the shower? I didn't hang up on you. All right... some other day then. Bye. I need to pee. I'm in a hurry to go out. - Where are you going at this hour? - I have a date. With who? Nobody you know. Come back early. You don't sound like yourself today. I'm almost there. Where are you? Okay. Bye. Take a good look. Take a good look at her. Does she look like someone I'd date? Maybe you like trailer trash. What if you like shit? Sorry, Kai Mui. I'm trying to explain to my girlfriend... that we met at an Internet café. We just played games together but she doesn't believe me. She said she saw us holding hands out in the street. That never happened, right? That's right. It never happened. Your girlfriend cares a lot about you. It's late. Why aren't you at home? Right back at you. That's different. I'm a lot older. Why don't you go home then? You go back first. I'll be going back soon. Will you be coming here again? If you do, I will too. Mui, time to go home. - Bye! - Bye. Actually, I don't like you doing this. Doing what? Your job. I'm already with you for free. If I don't take on other clients... how am I going to make ends meet? Must you put it that way? Hello? This is Kama. You called me just now. Would you still like me to go over? Sure. I'll give you the girlfriend treatment. Text me your address. I'll be right over. For an extra HKD$500, I'll stay the night. Okay. Bye. Aren't you worried about getting electrocuted? Do people die so easily? I hurt myself moving some stuff. I didn't ask. No. Isn't this what you want? No! I don't have condoms with me. It's okay. I'm having my period. Take care. Painful Steps It was daybreak and I knew I had to do something about Kai Mui's body. I took a cleaver, held up her body... and slit her throat to let the blood out. About ten to fifteen minutes later, when the blood had stopped flowing... I cut her open, from her throat... all the way down to her bellybutton. I didn't know someone so thin... could have so much fats. What the hell are you talking about? I saw her internal organs... but I didn't recognise the heart from the lungs. I just cut them out and minced it all up. I flushed it down the toilet, bit by bit. I chopped her head off first. It took four or five tries before the head came off. Then I moved on to her limbs. First, I scraped the flesh off the limbs. It took four to five tries to sever the legs. The arms were thinner. I could remove them with two to three blows. Mr Teng? After I'm done with the limbs... I decided to remove the skin. I yanked the skin off her face... but I couldn't get it off the rest of her body. Because of the fats under the skin. I tried to cut through the skin, but it didn't work. So I made horizontal cuts... and finally managed to get the whole skin off. I saw that's how the butchers do it, so I followed suit. Then I got to the bones. The tail bone was the hardest to break. Next were... the ribs. I broke them using the tip of my knife. There were about twenty of them. Then came the big toes. Maybe they were too thick. They were hard to sever. I tried removing the skin... so it would look more like pig trotters than human feet. So I could take them to the market. After I washed my hands, I placed Kai Mui's head in a plastic bag. At about ten at night, I decided to take a bus to Kowloon City Pier... because I know, even if there were police road blocks... they seldom search the buses. Upon arriving at the pier, I saw there were very few people. I threw the bag with Kai Mui's head inside into the sea. Daddy, how many people are there in Hong Kong? Seven million. Kill Cheung, that scoundrel! Does Uncle Jim count? - No, he's dead. - Kill Cheung, that scoundrel! - What about Bruce Lee? - There's no justice! - Is he dead? - Kill Cheung, that scoundrel! There's no justice! Kill... kill that scoundrel! What about Wong Kai Mui? How do you know about her? Mum was watching you on the news. That's how I knew someone called Wong Kai Mui is dead. Your mum watched me on the news? You can say that again. She sends you to ballet, violin and swimming lessons... on the days I get to see you. So I end up merely sending you to and back from your classes. I barely get to spend time with you each week. By the way, don't talk about me in front of your mum's new guy. - He'll get jealous, understand? - Okay. Furthermore, he may become your new dad any day. But I haven't seen him in a long time. Is that so? What happened? - Boss. - I'm not your boss. I'm not telling you anything. Mum will scold me if I do. I'm not your mole. I'm done talking. I'm tired, I'm going to nap. Yes, I've received it. Yes... I just roll it all over my face? Does it really work? My face will be become firmer after that? You still don't sleep much? If I go to bed early, I always ended up having nightmares. I'm on a dismemberment case now. The girl's name is Wong Kai Mui. - She was only sixteen when she died. - I know. I've read about it in the newspapers. I can't understand. Why would she tell a stranger she has just met that she wants to die? And why would he believe her? To be honest, when we first started dating... I used to find this behaviour of yours adorable. I loved to hear you talking about the cases. You were completely engrossed and I thought they made great stories. But after a while, it became a chore. I sent a text message to Kai Mui's dad just now. Red Devils lost. Congratulations. Dad: Kai Mui, did you change your phone number? Thanks, I miss you. I miss you too. Dad: Don't wire money to me anymore. Save it for a train ticket and come visit me some time. I didn't dare tell him his daughter is dead... because I know how it feels for a father to miss his daughter. But he doesn't know he'll never... get to see Kai Mui again. Don't be like this. What's with you? Stop crying. Come on, everyone's looking. Hello? Mummy just stepped out for a while. Why aren't you in bed yet? I'm on my way back now. Okay. All right. Bye. I've to go back now. Sheung. Our daughter is holding her birthday party next week. She wants to invite you. Is that okay with you? Sir, do you know the prisoner very well? Your name is already on Teng Jee Chung's visitor list. You can come any time. Well? Are you doing okay in here? I brought you some books. You can read them when you're bored. And this... this is really important. Thank you. The officer said there's something else you wanted to know. - What is it you wanted to ask? - I don't have anything to ask you. I made it up. It's just an excuse. I just wanted to visit. I didn't know you had included my name in your visitor's list. I don't have that many friends. Dismembered Hooker: Broken Family; Modelling Dreams Shattered These tabloids tell good stories and in great detail. There's a question I've always wanted to ask you. I thought you said you didn't have anything to ask. You weren't acting entirely under the influence of drugs. You claimed you didn't kill her over money or a personal grudge. Neither was it a sadomasochistic session gone wrong... what was it then? I don't understand what is it you want to know. On 13 May 1987... you and your parents went to Zhongshan for a ride... in your dad's cross-border truck. On the way back, you met with a serious traffic accident... and your mum died on the spot. I'd asked your dad when he was still alive. Officer, I've checked the oil and water. - Thank you. Can the truck be driven? - Yes. Please sign. The doctor says my days are numbered. What use do I have with a truck? Teng Jee Chung has instructed us to transfer all his assets to you. Mr Teng, I have a question for you. It's about the traffic accident involving your wife. He got me to meet a psychiatrist called Yeung Chan Bong. Dr Yeung still remembers your case. He told me he was very worried... that you'd suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome. Typically, children often mistakenly feel that... they're responsible for their parent's death. He has a theory. Your mum's early death has inadvertently caused you... not to trust women as you were growing up. Your relationship with Mo Yung also left you with a hatred for women. Do you really want to know so badly why I killed Wong Kai Mui? I don't want to know why you killed her. I just want to know why it happened. You're overthinking it. I don't hate Kai Mui at all. Why would I hate her? Actually, I'd fallen for her. I don't hate women at all. What I hate are human beings. I don't want Kai Mui to be one so I killed her. You ripped the skin off her face. Was that because you didn't want her to be a human being? What I didn't expect was... taking two lives instead of one. Did Kai Mui know she was pregnant? Don't ask anymore. Don't ask anymore! Don't... Don't ask anymore. Don't... Is this Kama? Yes. Hello. Are you a Hongkonger? Why do you ask? You can't be my client if you're not in Hong Kong. Your signature line reads... "A blush on your cheeks, a red ribbon in your hair." "Those fragments of the past are my memories of July." Where's that from? It's the lyrics of a song by Sammi Cheng. It's one of the songs my sister and I listened to to pick up Cantonese. Sammi is my sister's idol. That's how I got to like her too. I know she's very popular in Hong Kong. I really envy her. It's sad when no one notices you. I'd rather no one notices me. I'm ugly. I'm not much better myself. I'm sure I'm uglier. I'm very fat. Let's hope we won't be disappointed when we meet. Why are you still awake at this hour? Somehow, I don't get tired when I chat with you. Me too. It's my turn to ask questions. What would you want to be reincarnated as? I've never thought about that. Anything but human. It's really pointless to be one. What about you? I believe in God. We'll all go to heaven when we die. In heaven, we can do anything we want. My turn. Are you scared of dying? No. Sometimes I think being dead won't be such a bad thing. Why? Living means getting hurt. Living means feeling unjust. It means having to think about how to lead a better life. I want to be strong, but I get weary. Especially when I'm alone. "KDJFJDFJ" (Acronym for "A Room with a View") It's morning. It's another day. The world continues to move forward. Kama, shall we meet today? Come in. Have a seat. This is much more comfortable. I've fallen for you. Don't be corny. We've only just met. How could you have fallen for me? Why don't I read you a bible verse? Pardon me if I can't read it properly. I like this verse. 1 Timothy 4:4, "For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving." I want to die... I want to die... What? I want to die... I want to die... I'll help you. Why did you stop? The unforgettable days... are the faint memories of my home. In your diary, you said I looked like a little child seeing the world. But the sky above the canopy... was it any different that year? I couldn't understand what you said that day. I continue to create a busy life for myself every day... yet I dream of being a simple person. I turn around and ask the sky... can this life be easy? Do you understand this at all? A blush on your cheeks, a red ribbon in your hair. Those fragments of the past are my memories of July. Have the trees grown taller? Do you remember that day? Do you remember that day we parted? We met but had nothing to say. Continue to be wilful, child. Laugh if you're happy. Let the feeling of loss enter my body once again. Bottoms up before we go look for fairy-tale land! Alighting passengers, please get ready. - Mum. - Come, let's go home. Kai Mui, you're late. Don't you think that joke is too lame? Sister, not so hard. It hurts. Why are you crying, Sister? Aren't you happy I came? All right, I'll go back then. Officer Chong. I was just passing by so I drop in for a visit. I didn't expect you to visit us. Come, sit. It's very tasty! It's peanut, black-eyed pea and chicken feet soup. It's good for you since you run around so much. This will strengthen your legs. In a blink of an eye, Kai Mui has been dead for two years. Six months after Kai Mui died, Kai Lay got pregnant. I don't know what I did wrong in my previous life. Both daughters are just as insensible. I don't know who they hang out with. Officer Chong, you have a daughter, haven't you? - How do you know? - I heard it from your colleague. - Which one? - The one who smokes a lot. Oh yes, Officer Chong. Take Kai Lay out when you have time. I wouldn't have to worry if she has you. See, you're already making passes at each other. Do you want another bowl of soup? No, thanks. I'm full. It'd be just nice after finishing the chicken feet. You're full? Great. Kai Lay, put the baby down and go out with Officer Chong. - Go on... - Go out? I'd just been out the whole day with my daughter and ex-wife. I'm exhausted. So she doesn't stand a chance? You want me to take a picture of you again? How about taking one with me this time? I've always wanted to ask who this person is. Actually, we don't know who she is either. A few years ago, we were shopping in Dongguan... when we came across a photo studio. The pictures taken there were so pretty. Kai Mui wanted to have hers taken but we couldn't afford it. We envied those who could have such pretty pictures taken... so Kai Mui pleaded with the owner to sell her this picture. Smile. One, two, three. Again. Smile. Smile. In memory of Kai Mui
