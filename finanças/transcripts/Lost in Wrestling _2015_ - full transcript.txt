On the East side, Akanashi. Fujiyama is on the West side. Ready... Start, march Continue, continue Continue, continue Continue, continue Continue, continue Continue, continue Continue, continue Naren, you'll lose for sure! Continue, continue Continue, continue Akanashi! Naren wins! You won, but why do you want to quit? What is the reason? I know, that is prohibited. I was so happy, I lost control, suddenly... I danced the Eagle-Lion dance which the wrestler of my tribe used to dance after winning. That's cultural difference. No matter win or lose, We sumo players should be humble, not showing pride... Is this the reason you are dismissed? The master said I was a shame of their school. Also, I do want to quit. What will you do next? Once I was obsessed with everything of this city. And I loved Sumo. When I fell in love with it, I discovered that, my inner character doesn't match with it at all. I had to split up with it in great pain. In order to get rid of it, I jogged and sweated to lose weight every day. It finally faded out from my life. But I did miss it badly, it's so contradictory. At last, I even got "Multiple Personality Disorder". Akanashi! Its enough! Boss, it's me. Sayuri. You mentioned a women's wrestling team named J3... and my "Asia Heroines A3" having a friendly match It sounds like a money making business. You give the team, and I give ideas. If it works, we can become millionaires. But I want a 3:7 split on the profit. It sounds reasonable, you'll take 30%, and I'll take 70%. No. It's the other way round. Oh, Sayuri... Now J3 has never lost, they are in top popularity! If you agree, I will contribute everything I have. Collaborating with the Japanese sponsors, we sure can complement one another and happy together. And I know one more thing... Every year in inner-Mongolia, there will be a Nadaam Festival. Some brilliant female wrestlers will be found. Is that easy to find competitors for J3? Money makes the world go round. Granny, I was invited by the Japanese to fight in the female combat. I can make money at the same time, it's about 8 million Yen. Do you think I can beat them? You have been good at dancing and singing since you're a kid. And you are used to fight against the boys. With power, huh? Look! See the muscle! So hard! It's trained. I want to show you something. What's that? Wait... Look! What is this? Open it and you will know it. Come on. A picture? A reporter visited us some years ago. He took this picture. It's so nice, I have kept it ever since. He is Chi-na-si. Chi-na-si? Isn't he cute? I can vaguely remember. Granny, are you missing him? I can't help missing him! Look, this letter... He went to Japan when he was fifteen. He wrote me a letter a few days later since he arrived there. 15 years ago... after that he had ever sent any? This proves that he's missing me. Naren! The little horse is going to leave the prairie, are you afraid? Afraid? I fear nothing. I just worry that... no one is going to take care of you when I am abroad. God will bless your granny! I heard people saying that it's unlikely to see moon and stars in the city. You have to take good care of yourself, remember? - Granny. - Sister Gold-Moon. It must be the wind in the prairie that blows you here! I come to bring Naren a wish, and also take this chance to see you. Got it? I am inferior to Naren! You have forgotten me! Come on! Please don't hesitate, say it. Don't say it out if you want the luck! It's like that day in the wrestling race, who lost while she spoke. Granny, don't worry, I will have my mission completed. Don't say! I didn't ask you to do anything. Even though you didn't say, I understand. I understand, too. Is that for me? Come on... My dear grand-daughter is going abroad. Let me kiss you. Come on! You are our best girl! My good grand-daughter! Okay, I have to go now! Don't worry about me. Take care! Don't worry! Charge up! Charge up! Ruonan, remember to bring me souvenir when you're back from Hong Kong. If not, don't come back. Grandma, I am going now. Bye! Grandma told me, it's not hard for a man to understand a city. Just treat the city as a woman. Even though, it's not difficult to fall in love with her. Maybe, fall in love with her, and the result is... ...having heart broken. And, I feel a kind of undefined pressure. The city is filled with undefined pressure. Whenever I walk across this street, I feel like being stared at by someone. And I can feel a force punching on me. Hey! Everybody come and see... That is TSUTENKAKU, the landmark of Osaka. Height is 103 m Yes, madam Excuse me , sir, can you tell me how to go to this place? Foot Massage House! Just go ahead to that direction. Thank you very much! Mawako, what the hell you are doing! It is enough! Where are you going? Don't leave! Where are you going? Hello! Miss Hello! Which master you are looking for? I want to see Chi-na-si Miss, this way please. You sure like the fragrance of Shen Nong Grass. Especially those people who came from the prairie, they will never forget this smell. And only the Granny from the prairie can produce this kind of fragrance. You must be Naren! You've grown up! You must be Granny Yuan yang! Granny! - Come on, follow me. - Yes. Granny, I come here mainly for... I know... Gold-Moon is going to be eighty this year. She will never forget her grandson who left the prairie. That is Chi-na-si. And It's time for Chi-na-si ... To go home to visit his grandma. She is the bond to his father. Where is Chi-na-si now? Thank you. Egg-tart Master! Are the egg-tarts sold out? Don't worry, Mr. Ruonan. I have already got them ready. - Come on, the special souvenirs from Hong Kong. - Thank you so much. $4 change for one hundred note. Thank you. - Bye! - See you! How is your Grandma Yuan yang? She is fine. She told me to buy you some egg-tarts. She wants me to thank you for sharpening her tools. It's just my job! If not were your granny's help, I wouldn't have had a chance to sharpen knives right here. Granny said it's nothing to be praised. It's just a little of work. It could be an easy job for her, but it's a blessing to me. These are the tools which granny wants you to sharpen. Here come my old friends. We meet again. Pal, I will take good care of them. Guess what's it? This is a wonderful dagger, please take it. It's too precious for me. You'd better keep it for yourself. This dagger has its character. It wants to go home. Which home? Back to the prairie! I remember it was about 30 years ago, I had been traveling in Inner-Mongolia. A Mongolian Wrestler gave me this dagger. It's been with me for a long time. I have never sharpened it. It's very sharp. When you are back home, you can use it to cut mutton. It just fits to cut mutton! Actually, I have followed my granny to Japan since I was a small boy. Therefore, I have no ideas about the prairie. Prairie is a good place. You should go back to see it. Smith Master, I want to be your apprentice. Not to practice knife sharpening, but learning your sense of concentration. Concentration, it is rather difficult to learn. Why? Nowadays, many people's minds are filled with distractions. Sometimes, they don't even know what they want to do. I feel helpless. People don't know what they are thinking. They have no directions. Go back to the prairie and take a look. Actually, whether the knife is sharp or not, only the one who sharpened it knows the best. I really want to ask you, since you have been living in Hong Kong for years... why your Cantonese is still so bad? Capable in listening but not speaking. My wife, see... Young and beautiful. Who were not beautiful when they were young. I tell you, Egg-Tart Master... I am a good husband, a good father. The wife ran away and the daughter didn't want to go home. How good you are? Knife sharpening smith! Eight-Stones Smith! Can you say something? Can you hear me? You love sharpening knives more than loving us. When mom left, did you ask her to stay? You didn't, you didn't say a word! Why didn't you ask her to stay? Why? Why didn't you ask her to stay home? Are you losing your mind? Now, I am leaving! You, sharpen it, sharpen it... enjoy yourself! Go, go away! Good sales tonight, huh? Keep going. Call me if you need me. OK Excuse me! Do you want to have a look... Or do you want to be a fighter? Fighter of course. Five thousand yen, please. One ticket for Fighter, please. I need one only. Sorry, I thought you two are together. Fighter. Thank you. Isn't she the one who has just left? You are more suitable to be the white cat. Catches mice is a good cat. Welcome to the Sunshine Fighting Arena. Who are you waiting for? I can't hear you, louder please. Boss... Take a deep breath from your lower belly and shout again! Boss! Boss! Can't hear! Louder! Boss... Boss, I love you, I love you! That's right! OK! Now, on every Friday night, this arena goes back to women. Now in our world... There are too many heroes. All we need is women. Women! Women! Long life to women! You women are no inferior. But you are true heroines. The women on this ring, They can find Themselves... and become the super star! Boss, I love you, I love you! Moon-moon... Yes, Boss, I love you! I think this guy is crazy! Come quickly to the ring Quick , quick Go, let's go Where are we going to? To catch rats. Women to the ring! It's just like going back to mom's womb. Fight, fight away your sadness and grievances... Find yourself in this ring! Miss... if you don't punch now, you will never have another chance to punch in your life. Get up. This's it! Come on, transform your life pressure to force. Punch with all your might. Go! Go, get out of here! Stop! Ladies, after warming up, here comes our climax! We have invited a special guest from the prairie of China. Here we have, Naren, the Queen of Combat! What's it about? She looks cool! Hey, the Boss is coming out. Look! With the 24K gold belt on the waist. Fight with all your strength! Fight for this golden belt, okay? Today, I am so happy! There are three Asian Heroines born on this stage. Let's call you A3! They will challenge J3, a team of female wrestlers selected from the world. The Champion can get this gold belt. Boss... I don't want to participate in that Gold Belt Championship. I will be back to Inner-Mongolia soon. But you took the deposit already. I have something important to do. That's none of my business. Give me a hand please. You still have to train them up. Go in. Why do you take the umbrella with you? Why not? It's not allowed to wear clothes inside, but not included umbrella. Isn't this umbrella a gift by a man? Moon-moon, have you seen that Queen of Combat? She is... What are you doing here? So sneaky! You tell her. You tell her. You tell her! Queen of Combat! I know you are a great wrestler invited by Boss from somewhere afar. We, we just want to learn from you. Learn from me? What do you want to learn? - I want to learn anything from you. - Anything from you! Mom! Your mom? No! She looks alike my mom in her early days. Come over here! Moon-moon, auntie is waving to you. Go to her. Come with me. Hi, my name is Sayuri. You speak Chinese! A little bit. My name is Moon-moon, nice to meet you. How are you? My mom named me Moon-moon. It sounds nice. I think your mom wants you to make more friends. Why? In Chinese, two moons form the word "Friend". I came from Hong Kong. Sight-seeing? No, I wander around. So happen I am in Japan. You are on your own. Doesn't your family worry about you? I left after a quarrel with my family. It's not a wandering, you ran away. But you are like a prodigal son! You bring your umbrella with you to the bathroom. What's the reason, Moon-moon? I... I am sure it is an old painting. There are mountains and river. Also, there are sun, moon and stars. I think it must be the home of fairies. It sounds logical! It surprise me that you know so many things about China. You're right, it's the fairies' home. It's not far, it's just under your feet. Granny Yuan yang. It smells great! Isn't it Seng Nong Grass? Laugh, laughter is good to health. How are you lately? On TV show, huh? Did you join the fighting club? It's just for fun. - Granny. - Yes. Where is Chi-na-si? Has he come back yet? Now, his name is Ruonan, just call him Ruonan. He will be back soon. Granny, I never know egg-tarts are so delicious. This is made by the King of Egg-tarts in Hong Kong. The taste of it hasn't been changed for 50 years. The taste... Stop. For something, it's better kept deep in your heart. Grandma, I am home! Ruonan, you are home! Naren comes with some guests. Chi-na-si, come on, let's wrestle! No girls play wrestling! So, I will come and knock you down.. Ruonan. We haven't seen for a long time! Young man, see how is the health condition of that lady? Lady, she is weak. Needs FIRE supplement. You studied hard, my young man. And, how's this lady? She owns GOLD. Yes, I am lack of money. And, Naren... Naren is type of WATER. Not a usual type of WATER, but a kind of charity! On the East side, Akanashi. - Hey! Was that you? - Fujiyama is on the West side. Right, Ruonan... Granny Gold-Moon is going to celebrate her 80th birthday. Will you go back home? She is missing you badly! - Won! - Akanashi! No wonder, you were Sumo Wrestler! You should have good pay. Why you work as a foot-Massager? Just for fun. How's your living here? I've been here for some time, though I'm not used to it. Many people, many traffic. Not a time quiet! Ruonan, do you still remember our beautiful prairie? Excuse me. Hello... Good ideas! Lighter. Lighter please! Hey! "I wanna to say I love you" "I wanna kiss on your face" "I have to say you are lovely" "I wanna kiss on your eyes" "I have to say you are smart" "I wanna kiss on your lips" Granny How are you? Why are you here? We all want to celebrate your 80th birthday during the Nadaam Festival. It's wonderful! 79th or 80th birthday don't mean a thing to me. Everyone has to spend life anyway. If I can spend one more year, it's okay, If I can't spend one more year, it's okay too. We have to hold a great party. I just hope to spend my days with my family. We have to hold a great party. You, go to arrange it. We call our children to come back. Right? - Right!, family reunion. - That's right. Good! Family reunion! Naren will get back what I want most. I am going to arrange it now. - Go, hurry up! - Go... Bring more dried beef for them. - Hurry up. - All right. Run! Hurry up! "My mom gives me happiness in my life." "Mom raises me up!"” "Mom's love never ends..." This is a celebration! We have to make the Festival a grand one. We will celebrate Granny Gold-Moon's birthday together. Come on time. Good! The Nadaam. Will there be wrestling match? Yes, Naren will come back home. Are you kidding me? You want me to wrestle with her? What a joke! She is so strong! All right, at that time, we will go all together. Yes, we'll go all together. Mom... Oh, I feel so comfortable, babe, thank you so much. Dad! Dad! Go, go away! Don't come back again! How are you? Hi, Moon-moon. Why do you come this late? I just finished my practice, that's why I am late. Come and bath with me, okay? Sure. Let me rub your back for you. Thanks! I feel so comfortable! I always want to rub my mom's back. But I didn't have a chance. Mom? You take me as your mom? To become good fighter, not only you have to possess the fighting ability, you also have to know the space of combat well. More you understand and adapt to the environment of yours, more power you can release to win the fight. So, may we have the "Sandbag" here? Cover your eyes now. - Okay. - Okay. Ready? Three ladies in front of me came from different places. But they are approaching ONE target together. I really envy them. What I am missing is a target, a direction. I am like the duckweed, floating along the river. I can only be their sandbag! Good, not bad. All right, now everyone has the shield now. So, take my punch now. You will never win if you don't learn the pain. Ready? Bravo! Moon-moon and I practice together. Mawako, you hit the sand bag to train your strength. Yes! Excuse me, may I know who Mr. AKA NA SHI is? Yes, I am. AKA NA SI ? So you are Mr. AKA NA SHI? Yes. Sign please. Thank you. It's sent by Granny Gold-Moon. It is the armor of Inner-Mongolian wrestler! Oh, our mighty God of Blue Sky! Please grant me strength and wisdom! Please grant me the verve of a man! They are horse, lion, tiger, dragon and phoenix. These are the five spirits granted by God. And your achievements and honors, is kindly granted by your hometown and river. Our time is over. Now, we are going to see how you get famous. I want to be the King of BUKH! Moon-moon, what's the matter? Why are you here? This is Ms Sayuri, the manager of J3. Nice to meet you! This is a " Waiver of Liability and Indemnification Agreement". It's all about risk, after signing it, you live or die at your own risk. It has nothing to do with any body nor any parties. Well done! Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to the Sunshine... The International Charity Female Free Fighting Championship. First, may we have A3? The home team. Then, may we have J3? They will greet each other first. Attention! Bow! Nice to meet you! Charge up! Lora came from Singapore! Her component is nick-named... Mawako, the Osaka's Wave. It's just the right time. A great fight... Starts now! Go for the fight now, go! Let's see who will get the control first. Mawako treated her to a severe kick! Charge up! Oh, she stands still! She is just like a stone wall! - Stand up! - Mawako, stand up! This time she counter attacked by a neck attack! She wants to give her a big hug, doesn't she? Oh no! She is going to give her a "handstand"! What a hard time! She just can't hold it anymore! She is like a wild jeep with no brakes! Stand up! Mawako... Charge up! One, two, again, 2.99... Your applause please, to charge them up, come on! Rise! - Get up! - Get up... Rise! Rise! Don't go over there. Lora just can't stop the attack! She is like a Tosa Dog in Sumo uniform! Mawako! Again, bingo! It's really fun! Look, she is climbing up at the corner! A big meat ball is flying towards her! It's like a big rock! No, I mean some meteorites! Wow, it's really fun! - Mawako! - Stand up! Mawako, can you rise? One... Stand up! Mawako! Two, and then...

Be careful! Moon-Moon, do you have confident? Give me five! Try your best! Now we have entered another amazing battle! This is the second round! We have May Flower from Korea. And we have Moon-moon from Hong Kong. Wait, this umbrella... Is it raining outside? Keep it with the security guard please. Be good! Good girl. Are you ready? Start! Be more exciting please! At the beginning, they fight like dancing, it's really wonderful! Yes, fight! Punch now! - Moon-moon, charge up! - Charge up! Come on, again! Kick, kick her, yes, you've got it! Again, this is the most evil lock in the world! Bone vs Bone. They are both skinny! So, try to gain more calcium, girls! Oh, it's the time for Moon-moon to counter attack! This is a brilliant one! Bravo! Good, Moon-moon, you are great! I think both of them got hurt a lot. Beat her! Don't let her stand up! Moon-moon kicks! A wonderful kick! Followed by a chain of kicks! This shifted her from the dark side! Watch out! Won! You won! The winner is Moon-Moon! Moon-moon from Hong Kong wins! "A3 won this game, one tile." Ladies and gentlemen, I, Sayuri, will introduce the rules of the following wonderful race. Sayuri, you... This is to restraint Naren's strength. Boss, what's this? I haven't heard anything from you about this! Madonna, try your best! Yes. The following race is mud wrestling! Madonna is from Okinawa. Punch, be quick! Stand up! Stand up! Mud is not horrible! Yes, combat! Come on! No, just a bit more... Rise! Rise! Stop, what the hell! Umbrella... It's not raining! Wait... Damn you! Wait... Moon-Moon Stop! What a rare guest of mine! You swore that you'd never come to my arena, didn't you? Want some champagne? Boss, you hurt people again. This time, she is your only friend. You'd better ask her instead. Did she hurt me, or I hurt her? She didn't keep her promise. She hurt me! But, no matter what... The result of this championship... It is worth to celebrate, Naren Naren, don't treat yourself in this way. If you keep on like this, he will only treat you as... I will treat her as bitch! She is torturing herself, right? You can't even dare to say these words. You are not even a man! Hi, how do you feel about the match? Could you say something? Sorry, I am tired. Please say something, please! Please! Or, just some words, please. The show was wonderful! It hit a high TV rate, Boss! Naren's mud wrestling show was so sexy! I know you treasure her so much, your heart is broken! We can make big money in future. Sayuri, I did anything you requested. I just want you to promise me one thing. What's that? That is, leave me alone now. I don't want to see you again! Never! Come on, come with me to fight for my right. Boss... Come out! Boss! Come out, Boss! Boss! Hey, we can view the whole Sunshine City right here. I just feel that, that place... It's like the foot massage map I saw at your shop. Ruonan, come and take a look! Ruonan... You... Boss? Naren, you finally come by yourself! Ruonan? Why do you disguise as Boss? I am sorry. - I am sorry... - Ruonan... Ruonan... Does it hurt? Scared? Trash! What are you afraid of? I feel so bad! Would you please leave me alone? You'd leave me alone instead! If not were you, I wouldn't have been here. Trash! Do you have anything to say? Trash... Trash... Trash... Trash... I am talking about you, you trash! Rubbish! Trash! Damn you, trash! Trash... Trash... Trash! Because of this trash! You made me come a long way here to Japan. Because of this trash! He made me willing to participate that competition... which is just humiliating me! And because of this trash... in order to live in the city, he hides his sense of loving and thinking. And also, this trash... He made me know that, the one I love... The one I love is you! No matter you are Chi-na-si, or Ruonan... or Boss... The one I love is you! I love you! I am sorry! I can't find myself now. Give me some time. I will come back to you. I am sorry. It's so beautiful! Honey, have you seen that? It's so pretty! Dad! Let's go to restaurant together. Iced coffee. Brother Stone! Come on, take a seat. Two sets please. Two sets, same old ones. Nothing changed! Brother Stone, she has left home for a long time. It's good to return, so... you'd better eat more Hong Kong food. - Thank you. - Enjoy your food. Thank you. Your mom and you are the same. You just love eating the egg. And you leave me the pie crust. Boss. - I want to have an egg-tart. - Coming. Isn't four dollars per one? Yes, four dollars. No, I want to eat right here. Okay. Take your time, mind it is hot! This taste has been the same for 50 years! It's just been taken out from the oven, it tastes really great! I came a long way here for this taste. I live abroad, whenever my grandson returned home, he brought me egg-tarts as souvenirs. But when he was home, the egg-tart turned cold. Now I can eat freshly baked egg-tart, it's really fantastic! Thank you for coming! I just can't imagine that the smell of my egg-tarts... can fly to a distant land... Master, what's the secret recipe of making these egg-tarts? Nothing special. Nothing? I just follow my wife's old recipe to make these egg-tarts. When we were young, she loved making tarts and I loved eating tarts. Later, we decided to open this restaurant. We worked hard together, baked and tasted... So this is the secret recipe, are these egg-tarts made by your wife? Nope. She passed away for many years. I am sorry. Never mind, I am already recovered. In these years, I have insisted to make egg-tarts with that recipe. I just hope to share this love and taste... with everyone. This is the best way of memorizing her. I was unhappy once. It's because I failed to sharpen those knives well. At that time, your mom... She sent me something from afar. Look! This piece of stone is so pretty! Your mom sent it to me from Tien-shan! Look! There are three Chinese words on it. [t means stone obsessed... Your mom doesn't love staying home. She loves wandering alone. I do miss her, but what can I help? I just can't lock her up home. She needs freedom. Freedom. She wants freedom. That's right. I don't know whether I copied mom... Or, my mom copied me instead. Actually mom is always with you. I know. What do you know? This umbrella... That is mom. And? And, this umbrella... Your mom said, if one day you want to leave dad, you must bring this umbrella along with you. Although I don't know what's the use of it, when there is danger, it will sure protect you. Dad! No matter when I feel sad, I can get a relief just by one bite of the egg-tart! There is a sense of forever love towards your wife in the egg-tarts! Welcome! I am back. Try some. Where did you buy them from? Taste it. Hong Kong? "Facing my lover, I am like a fool" "While love faded, I am sensible” "Facing an old friend, I am his bosom friend" "Facing monk, I am a patient” "(Who am I?) I am a happy man” "(Who am I?) I am a sad person” "(Who am I?)

"People had been hurt by me, would blame me bad guy” "Donations to the moment, I am a good person” "(Who am I?) I am a guest” "(Who am I?) I am also a master" "(Who am I?) Contradictions are contradictory” "(Who am I?)" "Life is a drama show there are too many possible" "Who gave me the script and... turned to withdraw from the role of being~a" "Long road trip, why let the burden too heavy" "Whether their own or someone else"s expectations of me... not really” "I am a free man" "I am a dreamer" "Life is a drama show there are too many possible" "Actors constantly have different religious expressions... in the adjustment” He grew taller than before! He is not the same as he was a small boy. Look! Chi-na -shi has grown muscles! So powerful! You're finally home! Celebrating Granny Gold-Moon's 80th birthday! The BUKH Race now begins. It's a game of Chi-na-si vs Nakushi. Starts! Charge up... Please grant me the verve of a man! They are horse, lion, tiger, dragon and phoenix These are the five spirits granted by God. And your achievements and honors, is kindly granted by your hometown and river. Chi-na-si wins! Come on! Chi-na-si, I have been waiting for this piece of meat for years. Finally I have got it. Naren's punch woke me up. Granny Silver-Moon. Thank you! It's delicious! You'll have my full support for organizing a female BUKH Club. Thank you. But, it's not a club for females or males. I hope... it's our BUKH club. Yes, it's our BUKH club. This is the voice of hometown. Chi-na-si, you can not forget this sound, no matter where you are. You're finally home! Now, I know, as what my grandma said, A city is like a woman. And the prairie is the woman of women... The mother of earth. Naren, do you remember we played Bukh next to the river? Yes! That was my first time... It's because of you! I thought you would cry. But you laughed instead. I don't understand at all. Why did you laugh? That is my secret. Come on, tell me. It's a secret! If you don't tell me, I would knock you down. How dare you! Go! Why don't you go? Women are not allowed to go. Go, we'll wait for you right here. All right. God, the lost kid in the prairie is home now. Thank you for your guidance. Thank you for leading the lost sheep home!
