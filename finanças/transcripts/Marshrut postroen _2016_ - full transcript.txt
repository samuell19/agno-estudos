Mom, why are you crying? Mom is not crying, little one. Everything is fine. Sleep Come here! Come here! Come here! Silence! Do not scream! - Enough! Not! - Do not scream! Come here. ELIZABETH SMIRNOV'S BODY STAYED 8 DAYS IN THE TRUNK OF THE CAR UNTIL IT WAS DISCOVERED BY THE POLICE. BY JURY'S DECISION, ANATOLIY SMIRNOV WAS CONDEMNED TO 14 YEARS IN PRISON. THE DAUGHTERS OF THE SMIRNOV WERE TRANSFERRED TO CUSTODY AND GUARDIANS. THE CAR WAS SOLD. AND ITS DESTINATION IS UNKNOWN. PARANORMAL DRIVE Olga! Where were you? Olga. You don't want to lower the price. What will we do? I dont know. Let's look at another car. Which other one? For this price we will not get a better car. It really is a good deal. I just wanted a discount. All our lives we dream of having a car like this. You convince me. I will discount 20,000 rubles. He is not a man. It is a horned monster. Take a large knife from the kitchen. Throw it in the pan. Add salt and pepper ... And with potatoes! At last. I got very tired with the paperwork. I had to make three rows. I wanted to change the license plate number, but they asked me for too much money. - They could have removed it. Shall we remove it? - She is pretty. Ksiusha is going to like it. I promised Mom that we will pay her back in two months. We can, yes? I plan to stay here. - Everything to shit. The car and me. - They left a flashlight. - Works. - That is not like the last time, or no one else will give us credit, not even mom. Speak no more If something happens we will sell the flashlight. I still owe Vitalik 150,000 rubles. We will think of something. We will solve it. - Look how low! How often! - Andrey ... Andrey, it's too high. Andrey, turn down the volume! Andrey! I received an electric shock. As well. This way you will not put your hands where you should not. You did not want to buy this car, now it is taking revenge on you. It's strange. Maybe it's the humidity? The electrical system will have to be checked. Give me your hand. Ready? No longer hurts? It is not a car, it is a dream. I agree, it is a good car. We wanted a car like this. You're the best. Olga, you are the best. We are two halves. You and I. Andrey, I can't now. Olga, come on. Seriously, I can't do it here. "I can not here". "I can't over there." "I don't want now, I don't want later, I never want". How much longer are you going to punish me? - Forgive me. - It's okay. Here. Close yourself. I love you. Let's go. You will fly by plane, you will go to the beach, they will clear their heads, then speak calmly like grown-ups. Don't mess with my private life, okay? Do not frown, wrinkles are visible. Mojito. Cappuccino. You're still grieving, so you still haven't forgiven him. It would be better if you divorce and see what happens. When you have your own family ... you can get divorced and get married as many times as you want, do you understand? Did you pass your thesis? What a cute little car. Mom read our horoscopes. He said the goats will be lucky throughout the year. You are goat. You are a goat. Are you still taking those calming pills? - I do not do it anymore. - Leave them. I tell you because I am your sister. They cause side effects, consequences. It's your dad's car, okay? That's enough. That's enough! Mom, squeeze me. It doesn't squeeze you, don't make things up. Everyone should wear a seat belt , especially children. Mom is bad. She is pissed off. Why do you say that? She did nothing wrong to you. - Anyway, it's bad. - Enough! May our trip be pleasant and hopeful. Yes! Urra! Well ... ¡Cheese! Is rare. What happens to the phone? It's strange. Not one photo went well, they are all out of focus. You just don't know how to take photos, that's all. You do know. Will it have to be restarted? Olga, you will have all the vacations to take photos, you will fill your Instagram. Calculated route. Even here you have a woman. - Grandma waiting for us? - Yes, grandma is waiting for us. He is surely cooking delicious dishes for you. Hooray! Hey, we'll go in for a little while, we'll leave Ksiusha, we will not stay to eat, and we will go directly to the airport. Will you refuse my mom's food? Why do you care? The return roads will be free of traffic. We will eat. They will not leave without us. Are breakfasts included? We have everything included. Great. I will eat, drink, sleep and sunbathe. Ksiusha will be with grandma: running, jumping, playing sports, while mom goes to laze and put on weight. Mom will be fat! Mom will be fat! Who is she? Grandfather Pijto. Andrey, I'm not kidding. How am I going to know who he is? It's the first time I've seen that photo! Must be from previous car owners . That's OK? Stop! Come here! Come here! Let's go! You should muzzle a dog like that when you take it outside! - Shit. They are all crazy! - Af-Af! - Add potato chips. - Chips. - Dos nugget. - Dos nugget. - Two. - Two. Also ketchup ... Also mineral water and two tails. And two tails. - Everything to take away. - Everything to take away. Don't want to try a cupcake? - Are you playing, bunny? - yeah Keep playing. UNKNOWN Hello? Hello? Lena, is that you? Hello? What stupid joke is that? I love you! Let's play. Bunny, stay here. I'll go find Dad. ¡Ksiusha! ¡Ksiusha! ¡Ksiusha! - ¡Ksiusha! - This! Did you go crazy Take it easy. We just wanted to make you laugh. - Fuck. - Shit. Why did you take so long? There was a line. I don't know, I didn't see any lines there. No, I was purposely making time to upset your nerves. And you did it. - Where did you find that? - Here. You could have hurt yourself! Where here"? Whose is that? Maybe it's yours? Maybe it's from a harlot? - What are you talking about? What harlot - Yes of course! Couldn't you check the car after you bought it ...? And clean up all that shit? We found that photograph and now those scissors. We have no idea what happened in this car. Enough! I was present when this car was cleaned. - Give them to me, I'm going to throw them. - Great. When we get to the next garbage can, we will dump it there. I listen and obey. You are hysterical with balls. Dammit. Where do you look? I hit the brake. - You rushed. - But... But ... Is your car okay? Not well. Do you see the bumper? There is a scrape. Before it wasn't there. Hi. Good day. Do you also feel bad here? I'm feeling it. It is bad, if the car does not brake. They have to take it to a mechanic. At first, quickly reviewing, I see no problem. Everything is fine. I don't know what could have happened. I recommend bringing it during the day. The mechanic will be with the computer. We can make a complete diagnosis. Maybe there really is something wrong. Hey, I want to ask you a question ... Can it happen that when you start the car, is it like accelerating alone? Long ago you got the driving record? A dramatic event occurred in the resounding murder case, happened in the spring of this year in Moscow. As we have repeatedly commented in our newsletter, Anatoliy Smirnov murdered and butchered his wife, and hid the body parts in his car. The murderer was sentenced to 14 years in prison, who was serving his sentence in a maximum security prison. This morning, the body of Anatoliy Smirnov was found ... with signs of violent death as he remained isolated in his cell. According to the forensic doctors' report, the cause of his death was asphyxiation. Despite the mysterious circumstances of his death, the researchers rule out any external interference. Are you tired? I'm not well. - How many hours did you sleep? - About four hours. Do you want me to drive? No, Olga. I'm fine. Thank you. Andrey, forgive me. Why? For yelling at you. For demanding things from you. One minute of self-flagellation. Relax, it's over. Do I not know you? Hey, I get it, I'm an irritable person. Sometimes I react inappropriately, but ... Do not worry. Everything is fine. Did you hear that Than? The blows, back. There was no hit. It will have seemed to you. Mom, mom, I want to pee. So, let's go. - Will you pee here? - I don't want to do it here. Where do you want to do it? In the woods? Then we go to the forest. UNKNOWN - Bunny, do you want to sleep? - I do not want to sleep. And what do you want? I want to play with the bear. If you want to play with the bear, you will play with the bear. Ready. Fasten your seatbelt as we agreed, remember? - I already told you to squeeze me! - Let's see what happens. - Why did you scratch me? - I didn't scratch you. Then who was? Stop yelling at the girl. Forgive me, little one. I know it wasn't you. What scratched me? We better go, okay? - And what about the moose? - She dressed up as a butterfly. He always wanted to be a butterfly. But it was a moose. He had no luck. UNKNOWN And the others? The others said that the moose is crazy. Maybe we shouldn't go on that plane trip? Olga, how should we not go? We ordered the tickets a month ago. There is no refund. You wanted to travel yourself. But you didn't want to. UNKNOWN Because I did not want to? You have all the reason, we need to spend some time alone. Without routine, without work, without the girl. For the family, for Ksiusha, for us. Mom, pet the bear. During the holidays are you also going to chat? Olga, please. Only urgent SMS. I do not reply to the others. We agree to spend time together. I promised you that I would delegate business. Do you want me to lose people? Mom, pet the bear. If small. What kind of questions are those? Than? Do you want me to tell you about Kar-Karych? Where are the napkins? Wow. Where did you get it? Is it for real? Shoot rubber bullets. I take it in case something happens. There are many crazy people on the road. The way is long. Is it really with rubber bullets? Are you satisfied with the car? What's wrong, is the aura wrong? Are you hearing banging again? It's not funny. On the right is free. - Andrey, let it pass. - Yes right now. Andrey, what are you doing? - Andrey. - Rest easy, please. Why are you so stubborn? Dammit! Andrey, relax. - Hears! - Andrey, I'm asking you! ¡Andrey! What kind of person are you? Calm down, my darling. Calm down, my pretty, calm down, my girl. Calm down, my darling. Everything is fine. It's all right, little daughter. He was just a bad man. He was just crazy! Can you not talk like that in front of the girl? And how do you want me to say it? That the guy doesn't have a brain? That he just wanted to kill us? The guy needs to beat everyone! The guy is the fastest! You just should have let it go, that was it. Yes, but let me decide who I let go and who I don't, okay? Okay, but you are not alone in this car. What if we had collided, or overturned? Olga, why are you so smart? - Do we have a medicine cabinet? - No. Excellent. I should have known. But what...? We have an almost empty tank. ¡Genial! Of course it is "great". Am I to blame? You saw it yourself, it was almost full when the mechanic checked it. - Hello. Spout 6-95, tank full. - Spout 6-95, tank full. - Do you have dressings and peroxide? - Card or cash? - Card. Do you have dressings? - We have. Behind you. Do I get the receipt? Ksiusha, stay here, don't go out. Daddy will be back soon. It's okay. Andrey, you did well to call me. I am very concerned. Have you already spoken? Are you crazy, why are you calling me? Now I can answer you because she is not there. We agree that calls are a risk ... and SMS is also a risk. Andrey, I didn't call you. Do you want me to send you a screenshot? Andrey, darling, I swear, I didn't call you. Do you think I'm stupid? We had agreed. Did n't you send me the photos in thong ? Are you crazy sending me those photos? I am with my family, in the car. Fortunately, your number appears as "unknown". Andrey, I never wrote or called you. How can I know who is sending you those messages from an unknown number? Maybe you met another slut? You said that before? Not yet. When we'll return... I will talk to her. So that's why I take that trip, you know. Andrey, I love you so much. And I am very jealous. Please don't mention me, but Olga is going to kill me. Most likely, he will kill me first. And then to you. That's it. Goodbye. Add this to me please. For safety the belt is used instead of buying amulets. You have higher education. How smart you are. Andrey! Did you leave Ksiusha alone? I left her locked in the car for five minutes. Nothing will happen to her. I'll go to the restroom. ¡Andrey! Than? Give me the keys. Sorry. Excuse me She did not want to scare her. Everything is alright. - Lena, reassure mom. - He will bring you disgrace! - You're good? - Excuse me. Excuse me. She is just a sick woman. Ignore him. Where is she? - I only left her for five minutes! - How could you leave her alone? Ksiusha! Ksiusha! Didn't you see a little girl? - Ksiusha. - ¡Ksiusha! Ksiusha! Didn't you see a little girl in a yellow jacket? Excuse me, did you see her? My daughter escaped from the car. - No. - How? You work here! Excuse me, didn't you see a little girl? She has blond hair. ¡Ksiusha! Ksiusha! Did you see a little girl? ¡Ksiusha! ¡Ksiusha! ¡Ksiusha! ¡Ksiusha! ¡Ksiusha! ¡Ksiusha! ¡Ksiusha! ¡Ksiusha! - ¡Ksiusha! - ¡Ksiusha! ¡Ksiusha! ¡Ksiusha! ¡Ksiusha! ¿Ksiusha? ¡Ksiusha! Ksiusha. ¡Ksiusha! Excuse me Sorry. Excuse me Sorry. Ksiusha! Where were you? - Where were you? - Ksiusha, our dear girl. - Where were you? - You scared us. Because you left? Never do this again! Do you hear me? I was playing with the lady. What lady Why are you lying We were looking for you! I was playing with her. (Children's audio-story) He does n't see his close friend. Just feel the strong wind, as the snow falls on the field ... I swear to whatever you want that I had locked the car. It could not open by itself. Why couldn't it? It seems that it could. What a car you bought! We chose it together. God gives the tsarina a daughter. In 30 meters turn left. It's just a bug of some kind. The long awaited day ... Why are you looking at me? When we return to the city we will sell it. Do you want me to drive? Maybe you could sleep? Not all it's rigth. His admiration did not disappear ... And died at dawn. I do not know this way. Maybe we should go back to the main road? Maybe you shouldn't have turned? We have to do what the GPS says! If necessary, it is necessary. We had simply never toured there. Maybe they are repairing the road, and this path is a detour. Did you hear that We'll be leaving soon, little one. I don't know, maybe it was a bump, or a bearing. That was neither a bump nor a bearing. Someone was hitting. Not so fast! You heard it yourself. So it was a well or a branch under the wheels. I ask you not to overdo it. - Do you like being with me? - In what sense? In the direct one. Talk to me, spend time with me. Yes, I like being with you. Olga, we are only going through a difficult time. This is normal. It is the crisis of 7 years. Many couples get divorced at this time. We just have to get through this moment and everything will be fine. - For what? - What "for what"? Why get over this moment when together we are wrong? I am fine with you. "Well". A good word. What the hell ...? I told you we shouldn't have come here. - Is it my fault again? - Who else? I'm tired of you. Are you dizzy again? In 200 meters turn left. Thank you, my dear, but we are practically here. Let's go as indicated by the GPS. What is the meaning? This fool took us who knows where. Andrey, please, let's go according to the GPS. We are going to go astray. We are not going astray. I know the way. We will lose the plane, Ksiusha is still with us and there is fog above. We don't know where we are! - Enough hysteria! - I'm not steric! Do you trust GPS more than me? Don't you think that all our problems ...? Is it because of your mistrust? It is very difficult to trust someone who has betrayed you. Is that your favorite topic? We agree, I betrayed you. We already talked about that and you forgave me. That's it! I forgave you, but I didn't forget it. You didn't forgive me shit. Even to have sex with you ...! I have to beg, lower myself, feel guilt all the time! Any other man would have already left. You are right, I hate you. No need to make the trip. Fuck the holidays. Let's go back to Moscow. Go alone. What is happening again? Dammit! We were already here, okay? Perfect. All thanks to you, you are more stubborn than a mule. Shut up! Fuck. Andrey! There is someone there. Where? There, in the forest. There is no one there. Andrey, we're going to get a divorce. You can sleep with whoever you want. Super. - That's what I'll do. - There is no contact with the satellite. What are you doing? How are we going to get there now? - We will arrive! - Stop the car. Right now. I told you to stop the car! Fuck it! I told you to stop the car! - Drop the wheel! Drop the wheel! - Stop the car! Stop the car! Where are you going? I'm going to ask those people. ¡Andrey! Andrey, come back! Returns! We are alone here! Hey! - SISTER - Please. By... Firewood? Firewood? Lena, is that you? Boys! How can I get out on the main road? ¡Andrey! - How could you leave us alone? - Let's go! Let's go! - I went to ask about the road! - Do not Cry. Andrey, why is someone following us? - I do not know! - Do not Cry. Do not Cry. Andrey, we're being pushed. - I'm going as fast as I can! - Andrey, they're with us! Everything will be fine. Little girl, don't cry. Do not Cry. Already. Everything will be fine. Everything ... everything will be fine. Mother... Easy, easy, easy. Mom, are they going to kill us? Calm down, calm down, calm down. Be silent. Everything is fine, everything is fine, okay? Everything is fine. Mom is not crying. Mom is fine. Forgive me. Forgive me. We will return to Moscow. You also forgive me. Call Mom and tell her we're not coming. Let him lie down to sleep. For what? She is already sleeping. Let me drive You sleep. I'm not well. Thank you. Andrey, we have to sell this car. Why? You won't believe me, but I saw a woman in the back seat. It was a ghost. Olga, this is all because of your antidepressants. I told you they would cause side effects. - You shouldn't take them. - But I saw her. What did you see? Who was that woman? And the beatings you heard are for the same cause. You're right. I'm just going crazy. Everything is alright. Come with me. Everything will be fine. Fuck! ¡Andrey! ¡Andrey! Shit! ¡Olga! Olga! Opens! Olga! Olga, open up! Olga! Olga! Opens! I'm Andrey! Awake! Wake up, Andrey! Andrey, wake up! Andrey! - Olga, forgive me. - Did you go crazy? What were you thinking about? I said, "Let me drive"! - Do not yell at me! - I'm going to keep screaming! Because I'm sick of your stupid character! Couldn't you stop and rest? You are the one in a hurry! You said that... You almost killed us! Do you understand What were you thinking about? Who is the hooker that sends you SMS from an unknown number? It is none of your business! - Did you ever love me? - Yes, I loved you! Only that your hysteria, phobias, fears, paranoia ... You really need to go to an asylum! I wanted to save the family. Did you ask me if I wanted to take that vacation trip, Or is it another stupid idea from Olga? The only stupid idea was to have a daughter of yours. She fall asleep. We can go. Olga, forgive me. I don't know how this could happen. Let me drive myself. If you're right. What is this? I tore up and dropped this photo. I dont know. Maybe there were several. What do you do? Let's reconcile. Ksiusha sleeps. We will do it in silence. Don't go screaming. You are crazy? - Sorry. - Be careful. Mom, will we be there soon? Sleep, little one, sleep. We will arrive soon. Good night. I'm Inspector Artamonov, 5th DPS GIBDD regiment ... from the town of Jaroslav. Documents please. Here you go. - Are you traveling alone? - With the girl. As you can see they are sleeping. His attitude is irresponsible towards the girl. Why are they in such a hurry? Why did you exceed the maximum speed limit ? I didn't go too far. If I don't hurry we will miss the plane. But, they go to the airport in the wrong direction . Where are you going? On vacation with the family. I don't take a vacation ... since two years ago. Position 14, answer. We are speeding. Received. Position 14, understood. It's okay. I wish you a good trip. Thank you. Hello Andrey? Excuse me for calling you. You're good? Andrey, are you there? Hello? Answer back. Whore. Bitch. Female dog! Dirty! Hi. Give it to me here. My good girl. Come in, do not stand there. How was the trip? Good. I'll go wash my hands. Did she eat something? Do you want some tea? What towel can I use? Take whatever you want. And where is...? You are dizzy. Sleep in the car. I am not a stranger, it could have entered. He feels bad. I'm going. I have little time. Give my greetings. - Let me know when they arrive. - It's okay. We are two halves. We are two halves. You and I. We are two halves. Your... We are two halves. You and I. You exceeded speed again? I love you. Let's play. I love you! Protect me and save me! Andrey, are you here? Andrey? Andrey! Drop your weapon! I order you to drop the gun! Drop your weapon! ¡Cheese! Are you sure you were with the boys last night ? You rave.
