[♪♪♪] This is where I intercept with the target? Exactly. [♪♪♪] Spare no one, Julia. Or we die slaves. MAN [ECHOES]: Spare no one, Julia. Spare no one. JULIA [ECHOES]: Or we die slaves. Or we die slaves. Spare no one, Julia. Spare no one. Or we die slaves. Or we die slaves. Spare no one. Or we die slaves. Or we die slaves. Or we die slaves. Spare no one. Or we die slaves. Or we die slaves. Are we ready to go? She's a little nervous. She's a little nervous. She's a little nervous. You'll make a good martyr. You'll make a good martyr. You'll make a good martyr. Spare no one. Meanwhile, all of our comrades will be getting killed one by one. It will be worth it. It will be worth it. It will be worth it. Nicholi, you have to be patient. Your moment will come. Now go. You have work to do. [PIGEONS COOING] [GUNSHOT] [♪♪♪] NICHOLI: Spare no one, Julia. JULIA: Or we die slaves. MAN: Are we ready to go? NICHOLI: She's a little nervous. MAN: You'll make a good martyr. ...come. Now go. You have work to do. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Yes? Turning the corner. Okay. [HANGS UP PHONE] [♪♪♪] [THUD] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [♪♪♪] [GUNFIRE CONTINUES] Stop! Stop! Get the fuck out. [SIREN WAILING] [GUNFIRE CONTINUES] [TIRES SQUEALING] [♪♪♪] Boss, you said this was the high-level security facility. Well, it is. Why, you already in? Mm-hm. You're good. Let's go. Send me the scan. There you go. Thomas, make sure those encryptions are right. I don't want to get stuck at that gate. Nah, she's good. Numbers are virtually the same. MAN: Perfect. That's what I'm talking about. Let's do it. [♪♪♪] [GATE BUZZES] [GATE BUZZES] [MEDICAL EQUIPMENT BEEPING] Who the hell are you? Who the hell are you? Prep that arm. There's a thing called the Geneva Convention. I've got rights. You know about that, do ya? You are fucking dead! You are dead! You are fucking d-- [GROANS] Jesus, doc. Are you sure you hit the right vein? No vein there. It's IM. Get that bag ready. Scary shit. Okay, you guys can leave, please. Nurse? [MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY] NURSE: Doctor? Okay, he's going into anaphylactic shock. Get me 2 c's of epi, right now. We'll work on the airway later. Guys, we're gonna have to transfer him. He's a red wristband. We can't transport. We have to. I don't have the facilities here. GUARD: Under whose authority? Under mine. I'll call an ambulance. GUARD: Open the gate. We've got a flatliner. Transporting now. [♪♪♪] [GATE BUZZES] Get him up. All right, move it, move it. [SIREN WAILING] Stop the vehicle! Wait a minute. What's going on? You're not a doctor! [BOAT HORN BLOWS] [SEAGULLS CAWING] Been away so long, it even feels good to be stuck in L.A. traffic. I hope my brother cut you a good deal. It was worth the trouble. How many years were you in the system? For long enough to know my way around. So do you have any other skills, or do you just break people out of prisons? What kind of skills are you looking for? Do you know what a little fat boy is? Why would you ask a question like that? Jonathan Cold, ex-CIA. Current freelance operative, specialized in covert operations and nuclear weapons intelligence. I don't recall leaving my resume with you people, but I'm impressed with the way you've done your homework. Who do you think employed you, Mr. Cold? You don't think I'd entrust my freedom to my baby brother? You're here because I wanted you here. Simple as that. So, what's your day rate? [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] Whoo-hoo. Ah! I can't believe you're safe. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] Ah. Good to see you, brother. [SHUTTER CLICKING] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] Wait a minute. Jesus Christ, that's Jonathan Cold. God, I thought he was dead. Who is Jonathan Cold? He taught me everything I know. I had excellent help getting here. Expensive help. Come on inside, Mr. Cold. Get you the rest of your money. No hurry. Mr. Cold's gonna be staying around for awhile. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] NEWSCASTER: A robbery in the Amsterdam Diamond District. Interpol believes a Chechen resistance group is responsible for this and a string of other robberies across Europe, presumably to finance their political goals. Joining us is Dr. Richard Turpin, an expert on European terrorism. Thank you. Besides funding their operations with daring robberies, what else do we know about this organization? A year ago, their leader, Aslan Masklov, was assassinated in what is believed to be a CIA hit. The group has intensified its terrorist activities since, and vows vengeance on the United States. [CLICKS REMOTE] Good job getting my brother out of that place. Yeah, my pleasure. What exactly does he want you to do for him? Well, why don't you ask him? You forget who's paying you. I made the deal with your brother. So if you have any issues, why don't you take 'em up with him. Don't get too comfortable. [DOOR CLOSES] Any movement? Nothing yet. Just waitin'. So tell me about your friend. Well, he was my first handler. One of the best operatives in the field. So why is he working for the bad guys? I'm not sure. Rumor has it he turned tables, killed six agents and then disappeared. [♪♪♪] Now he's classified as a foreigner. Well, there's a shoot-on-sight sanction on all foreigner operatives. If he's seen, he's dead. Exactly. So why is he here? This isn't his style. I'm gonna call Greer and fill him in. [DIALING CELL PHONE] [PHONE RINGS] Greer. Stuart here. Looks like we got a little party goin' on. Donovan just showed up. Interesting. Have you heard of any prison breaks? Nope. But he had an escort. Jonathan Cold. Cold? Mm-hm. Are you sure? Intel says he died last year in Prague. Well, he's here and I'm pretty sure he's not dead. You know him? Yeah. A long time ago. Be careful. Dead or alive, Cold is a dangerous man. Should we alert the Marshals Service? Let 'em know that we found a man? No. Stay dark. Donovan is only one piece of the puzzle. I want to know exactly what they're up to before we make our move. Yes, sir. NICHOLI: Finally, we have reached our target: The great city of Los Angeles. One more time, that's all. One more. Then we have enough. And then everything changes. MAN: It's big. See how much bigger it is than the one your boyfriend bought you? But size isn't everything. Believe me, I know. Girlfriend, they'll hear wedding bells looking at that. Hands in the air. Come here. Come here. Open it. I don't have the combination. I can't. How about now? Hm? Come on. Come on! Do it! Take a breath. [INHALES] Now, one at a time. [LOCK CLICKING] [VAULT OPENS] That wasn't so hard, was it? Hm? [♪♪♪] DONOVAN: Only two types of sales make the kind of money I like: drugs and weapons. I hate drugs. You still interested? Well, that would depend on what's in it for me. Two hundred K up-front. Another 800 when the job is done. I'm listening. If you were me, would you buy this? No. Why not? Because there's only half the schematic there. It's a teaser from the seller. That's right. You see, in this business, the keys to the kingdom is weapons-grade plutonium. If you ain't got that, you ain't got shit. You'd be surprised how generous the local nuclear test program is. You just have to know who to ask. I heard that. [DOOR OPENS] DONOVAN: Jonathan's in. Isn't that right? Yeah, that's right. Need to talk to you. Give us a minute. Relax, James. You're getting yourself all worked up. I don't trust him. I want him out. I trust money. He needs us more than we need him. Three years you've been gone. Three years I've been putting this whole deal together. The people, the product. All me, all me, all me. I've risked my ass to get you home, and it's still not enough? When do I get a say? You did good. I'm proud of you. But you didn't get me out. He did. Cold stays. They called. They wanna meet tomorrow morning. We're not ready. They are. Well, then... I guess we're gonna have a busy night. STUART: What is a common criminal like James doing hanging out with a Russian nuclear physicist like Myshkin? Okay, let's just say, for argument's sake, that they're trying to build a nuke. Where would they get the plutonium? There are two power stations in Oakland and a test facility in Pasadena. Okay, the test lab in Pasadena is a civilian facility. Start there. The security should be lighter there. Then find a shortlist of their newest employees and run backgrounds through the grid. I'm gonna take a walk, so you keep your cell phone on. All right. Time to give it up, baby. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [DOOR BUZZES] MAN: Morning.Good morning. [BEEPING] Ah, ah. Sorry, I was-- Much better. Can't beat this California weather, can you, Mr. Macabe? Better than Los Alamos. Bet you're happy you got transferred here. Every day. Have a nice day, sir.You too. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] STUART [WHISPERS]: Keep moving. [♪♪♪] Find anything? Gun. Please. I thought we were all on the same team. I trust my men. No one else. You know what? You can't kill everybody you don't trust. I owe you once for bringing him back. [WHISPERS] Won't ask twice. Is that right? [GRUNTING] [BONE CRACKS] Ah! Get his phone. Follow me. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [STUART DIALS CELL PHONE] [WHISPERING] Yeah. Hey, Myshkin's here. DONOVAN: Doctor, a pleasure as always. You said no guns. No need to worry. Want me to get you something to drink? Where is my money? Very well. Business first. DONOVAN: I believe you have something for me. I tell you, she is very delicate. Based on the Mk-54 design, but with 23 microprocessors and eight charges. Each precisely calibrated to fire within two microseconds of the next. Implosion causes the core to reach critical mass and then... Well, then... you know the rest. Yeah, she should yield a 5-kiloton charge. Just like you asked. Small but powerful. Like the heart, if you will. A child can carry this. Uh, uh... Here is the rest of my test results, along with the rest of the plans. They are all there. You can look. Go ahead. [TYPING ON KEYBOARD] Then I guess we have a deal. Gentlemen, thank you very much. Uh, brother, where's the password? The ignition sequences are missing. Without the numbers, there's no boom. Is this how friends behave? It-- It is only an insurance policy. Please, I am not a stupid man. The numbers. When I get to my car, you will have everything that you need. I cannot spend my money if I'm a dead man. Go with James. [♪♪♪] Thank you very much. [♪♪♪] What? You're a piece of shit, that's what. Oh... that hurt. I did it for you. You wanted to... get paid, right? Oh yeah, it's all about the money, huh? If these are the wrong numbers, it'll be interesting to see what your next trick is. Thank you. STUART: Greer, it's Stuart. This is goin' down right now. It's good? It is. Give me the book. Who you selling this to? Since when do you ask questions, Mr. Cold? It's not your style. No, you're right. I don't know what got into me. What if they try to screw us? They won't. What if they do? It will make no difference. They will all be glowing in the dark in the end. We are days away from realizing Aslan's dream. Just days. No more petty crimes. No more blowing up buses. We are ready to die, and they are not. [♪♪♪] They're here. Copy. [SEAGULLS CAWING IN DISTANCE] We have an appointment. [DOOR CLOSES] [♪♪♪] No guns. You first. No guns. No deal. Those two stay here. [GATE CLOSES] Do you have the diamonds? Where are the rest? When we have the device and the plutonium, you get a key. Key to what? A large safe-deposit box full of diamonds. A lot of diamonds. Our friend, Mr. Cold, ran a complete diagnostic. It passed with flying colors. Here's the rest of your plans. Password. [KEYPAD BEEPS] MAX: Well, Mr. Macabe... Looks like you're not exactly who you say you are. [DOOR OPENS] [GUN FIRES] [GRUNTS] Who the fuck are you? Where is she? Who? Where is she? [SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] [SCREAMS] [INHALES, SIGHS] [PHONE AUTODIALS] [CELL PHONE RINGING]What's he got? [TYPING ON KEYBOARD] [LINE RINGING] [GUN CLICKS] Be quiet, you bitch. [WHIMPERS] So where's my plutonium? As I told you, we have to wait. NICHOLI: How long? A day, at most. [DOOR OPENS] [GRUNTING] Aaah! MAN: Hey, look what I found here. NICHOLI: Who the hell is this? Maybe we should be asking you. Were you followed? SERGEY: We're being set up. Hold it! Who are you? I'm a reporter for the Times. Since when do reporters carry guns? Ah. Directional mike. Telescopic zoom. You spooks are all the same. CIA?[COCKS SHOTGUN] Please don't shoo--Shut up! How many of your friends are out there? Just shoot her. You want to live? You better find something to say. [CHUCKLES] What a silly girl. Well, have it your way. I'm disappointed, Jonathan. I thought we had an agreement. Shit happens, you know? I don't give a shit. [STUART GRUNTS] Aah! [GUNFIRE CONTINUES] Get them! No! Nobody move. They have seen us. They know who we are. They know what you're doing. Nicholi! Then you'd better get them. Go! Now! Stupid, stupid idiot. I knew it. Jonathan Cold. [CAR HORNS HONKING] [CAR HORN HONKING] Good to know you still have the magic touch. It's a shame you don't. I mean, what was that, How to Surrender to the Bad Guy 101? You are my teacher, O master of spook. Apparently not. You haven't learned a goddamn thing. [GUNSHOT] [TIRES SCREECHING] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [CAR HORNS HONKING] [TIRES SCREECH] [STUART YELPS] [GRUNTS] I'm in. STUART: Get out of the way! [TRUCK HORN HONKING] [GUNSHOT] Find the lever.What?! [GUNSHOT] [TRUCK HORN HONKS] Shit! Hold on. Shit! [GUNSHOTS] There are no brakes. We're gonna have to jump. What? Jump! JONATHAN: Enjoy the ride? Well, it's nice to be appreciated, anyway. You wanna tell me... what you and your new best buddies are planning to do? Oh, let me see... Shoot you in the head and make Vegas beachfront property. Yeah. With your help. Look, these guys have access to the plutonium now. You know what that means? They could make a bomb right quick. We don't have time for this. I can't believe that you are a part of this. We work for the same people. Just on a little different level. You disappeared for six years. You expect me to believe this bullshit? Believe what you want. I'll brief you later. You can't just walk away, Jonathan. So, what do you want me to do? Whatever it takes. Right now, that just means getting out of here. Try these. [ENGINE STARTS]Where are we going? The warehouse. You know, back in the day, one of the first things I taught you is: When you're on the run, never go back to where you came from. You're on the run, not me. And I gotta find my partner. MAN: Looks like he's been doing his homework. It's Macabe. [PHONE AUTODIALS] It's me. He found him. Yes, sir. It's a bad day for you. [GUNSHOT] Any idea who those Russians are? Well, that's a good question, isn't it? You know, for someone who's on the inside, you don't know very much. You think? Look, why would they classify you as a foreigner if you're still working with the agency? Darlin', you just need to kinda hang around me for a little while. Let me get you up to speed. Right now, you're just a little bit out of your league. Then help me understand. The agency has four top-secret columns. Those columns are dedicated to doing work that's... probably considered by many people to be immoral or illegal. Nonetheless, it's stuff that we have to do in the interest of the United States' security all over the world. I belong to one of those columns. There's two people above me, two people below me. Nobody else knows about me. Nobody but you, right now. So that means folks might try to come and kill you. I'm a senior agent. Why wouldn't I know about this? Well, what do you think the agency's, uh, main m.o. is? Disinformation.That's right. What do you think the greatest business in the world is? Drugs. And above that, there's war. Okay, so it's the same old song and dance, but... busting an international arms dealer out of jail? Placing nukes in the hands of baby-faced fanatics? I mean, come on. This doesn't make any sense. This is not exactly what you think. I think you know me well enough to know that I couldn't have opened up a coffee shop or something. So how long you been watching these folks? Two months. We've been following him since Philadelphia. I think this is a bad idea. It'll be worth it if Max has a lead in the plutonium. If it don't work out, we're gonna have to shoot our way out of this. Fuck! [CELL PHONE DIALS] They're in. Yes, sir. Oh, my God. Oh, Christ, Max. Who did this? Stuart, this place has been compromised. We gotta get out of here. No, I... I gotta find some information. He left me something. Listen to me. There's no time. We gotta go. I gotta find it. Stuart. Gotta go. Now. Let's go. Just wait. [BREATHES] [GUN COCKS] Agent Stuart. Greer? What are you doing here? Pierson called me in. What happened here? Why don't you tell us. No, don't do it! What's he doing here? He's helping me. Please, sir, just... put the gun down. I can explain. You're lucky to be alive. So, what exactly did Pierson dig up that got him killed? We're not sure. Myshkin showed up last night and Max and I got separated and... we came back here and... this is how we found him. That's it? Who's this guy down here? Is he one of yours? There's a leak within the agency. A small faction that's working off the grid. We don't know why ,or what they're after, but you may not be safe. Me? Look around. This was no accident. Come on, I'll bring you in, debrief you on the way. You're gonna trust him? [INAUDIBLE] What the fuck are you doing? [DOOR CLOSES] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS CONTINUE] Go, go, go! Move it, move it, move it. Go! You all right, man? I'm good, but there are some people up there that are no good. Not doing too good up there. [CAR ALARM BEEPS] [STARTS ENGINE] Did you get them yet?Not yet. But my people are on it. That does not sound very reassuring. With the CIA after us, we have to move up our timeline. I need my plutonium now. Yeah? You really gonna do it? I need a place to put this thing together. What kind of place? Metal workshop with a lathe and C4. Something clean and discreet. And we need protection. I'm gonna need more. A lot more. Don't you worry. We have vacuumed half the globe for diamonds. You will be well rewarded when you complete your end of the deal. Those diamonds will be about the only currency worth anything for the next 10 years. You will be a very rich man in the new global economy. [LAUGHS] Just be bloody sure I'm not here when it goes off. You get me my plutonium, I'll give you 12 hours to get out of town. If Cold comes back, he's mine. You just get me what I need. I almost forgot...again. [DETECTOR BEEPS]Mr. Macabe. [DOOR UNLOCKING] I'm sorry that it's so late. MAN [ON PHONE]: No problem, Mr. Brown. Everything has gone through. The helicopter will be available from tomorrow onward, sir. Okay. Thanks. Have a good evening. And you. [PHONE RINGING] Yes. MAN [VOICE FILTERED]: Are you alone? Damn it, what is wrong with using the Internet? Relax. Just checking in. Do you have it? I got one more run. After that, I'll have enough. Good. Where is it? Well, it's not here. But it's safe. Get it ready. It's almost time. [PHONE BEEPS] [♪♪♪] Still broken, Mr. Brown. [♪♪♪] Contact your seller. We'll be ready in four hours. Yeah. Hey. Go over my escape plan if I were you. Round up some men. Get moving. We have no time. [FEDOR SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN] [NICHOLI SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN] [FEDOR SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN] [NICHOLI SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN] Can I talk to you? Talk. I have a bad feeling about this. I don't trust these men, Nicholi. As long as we stay focused, we'll be fine. The timing is not right anymore. The CIA knows what we're up to. Why don't we wait it out? There is no more waiting. Who else wants to quit? Huh? Nobody wants to quit, Nicholi. But we don't want to get ourselves killed before we push the button. We don't want to die like Julia. Julia, she sacrificed herself. STAZI: We vowed to be martyrs. not corpses without a cause. There is no more time to waste. I am finishing this. With or without you. [FEDOR SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN] Room 467, 6:00. Right. [PHONE BEEPS] Got four guys heading that way. Plane's on the runway. Whenever we get there, it's ours. Good. Cool. Are you ready to give up your home to a bunch of lunatics? Yeah. Well... fuck them. Once we get the key, we waste them. Yeah? May I help you? Hi, I'm with the EPA. I have a meeting with Dr. Macabe. Well, Mr. Macabe's right down there. If you hurry, you might be able to catch him. Thank you. [MUTTERING SOFTLY] Fuck. Uh...I'd heard you were dead. Devil didn't want me, Billy. Just didn't want me at all. Yeah, okay. You know, I was thinking... if you didn't want to get found, you should leave the suburbs. Yeah, well, the rent's cheap, you know. Listen.Uh-huh? I was wonderin' if you could do me a big favor? Can you use all of your tricky-dicky spooky talent that you got there? Can you take a look into my old company, check out some supervisors, one named Greer, G-R-E-E-R, and see what you come up with? That's it? Well, no, that's not it. I got a few more things. And if I--? If I do this, you--? You won't kill me, right? No, I don't kill people. But you know what? I got something better for you. Do this for me right, I'm gonna hook you into some TS Intel that even you can't reach. A real lifesaver, you hear me? Okay. That's-- I'm gonna do that now. Just give me a minute. [COMPUTER BEEPING] It just takes a minute. Hey, man, I got all day. Load up. [♪♪♪] Follow me. Wow. Someone's been busy. Eastern Europe, Balkans, Estonia, Chechnya. On what's he been working? Uh...oil, gas, uranium. He's guarding assets. Uh-huh. Well, he's been dark for about two years and then last year, he took over as the district chief. All right, look, I need you to see if you can check into any e-mails in the last 72 hours. Oh, yeah, sure. You mean his personal, highly-encrypted e-mails? Is that what you want me to do? Look, look. Just do it, okay? And find out if the nearest nuclear test facility is, and if there's been any cross-contamination with any of his guys, stuff like that. Oh, yeah, sure. It's really-- It's very simple. Yeah. Okay. I'll-- I'll do that. It might take me a minute. [♪♪♪] [TELEPHONE RINGS] Yeah. All right, I'll be there. [MUFFLED VOICES SPEAKING] Don't do it. Throw the gun over there. Now. Look, I'm-- I'm CIA. Who isn't, nowadays? Toss it. Now! [DROPS GUN] Now, where's the plutonium? STUART: Ah! Unh! [GRUNTING] Aah! [GRUNTING] [CLICKS] Oh, you bitch! [SCREAMS] Ah! Aah! [GUNSHOT] [GASPING] [GRUNTS] Son of a bitch. [GROANING] Where the hell is it? BILLY: This guy is connected. All black ops. Uh...Chechnya, Balkans, Estonia. Same. Just like my old friend. Who else? Well, wait a minute. I got a hit. BILLY: Julius Macabe. Uh...employed eight months, top level security clearance. Plutonium...disposal technician? Yeah-- Yeah, okay, that sounds like fun. Yeah. What does the e-mail say? Look, I-- I told you, I can't open it. These guys are-- Are whales. They're triple-encryption and blinds, all sorts of shit. It-- It would take weeks. I can't do it. I'm sorry. Right. Okay. Gimme an address. All right. Fine. All right. That's about 10 blocks from here. Listen, Cold, I, um... I actually-- I got some bad news for you. In putting together all of these names, I-- Them showing up in one locale like this, it's obvious that a cleanup team is coming to hit you. A-and these guys are-- They're the best. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. What about my bonus? Get out of L.A. Right away. Uh-huh. What the hell does that mean? "Get out of L.A. now"? Oh, fuck me. This-- [♪♪♪] [DIALS TELEPHONE NUMBER] Yeah, this is Harry Brown from Tishman. I just wanted to check on my rental. Very good. Thank you very much. [PHONE BEEPS] [♪♪♪] [MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY IN DISTANCE] My man. What's up? CLERK: Uh, excuse me. The elevator is broken. Yeah? May I use your phone? Thank you. Stairs. [WHISPERS] It's gotta be in here. [HOLLOW KNOCKING] Ah-ha-ha! Gotcha. [MEN CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY IN RUSSIAN] [GASPS] Oh, shit! [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [BOTH MOANING] [KEYS CLATTER ON TABLE] Room 667. Said he'd be here. [MOANING] Oh. Who the hell are you? Shhhhh. [WHISPERS] Be quiet. Shit! Who the fuck is this? He's dead. Package is in the bathroom. MAN: It's not here. That's it. Where is it? Tell me right now. We can end this right now, if you want. Not now, Nicholi. You better not be fucking with me, man. I kill you. Go ahead. Sweep the hallway! Let's go! [PEOPLE CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY] All right, listen. If we retrieve this plutonium, we can save the op. You guys make it around back, meet me in the center. You're my team. Let's do this. Make it right. MAN'S VOICE: This isn't what it looks like! I-- I don't know her. It's not-- I-- I-- It's not-- Shh. Hey. Check it. [WOMAN SCREAMS] Stupid bitch! [PEOPLE CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY] [PEOPLE SCREAMING AND YELLING] Aagh! [SCREAMS] Ah! MAN: Dial 911, man. This is it. Where's my key? Where am I going? Sun Country Bank, San Diego. I wouldn't dilly-dally if I were you. Let's move. [GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] COLD: Don't move! [GUNSHOT] Where's Sergey? Where's Fedor? What happened? Nicholi, tell me! What's going on? Shut up and drive. [GASPS SOFTLY] [POLICE SIRENS WAILING OUTSIDE] I thought you were dead. You all right? Yeah. Okay. [GRUNTS SOFTLY] Yeah, just park it right there. [POLICE OFFICERS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [SNORES QUIETLY] Can you open the door, please? We're closed. Let me in. Please. [LAUGHING] We're closed. Please, open. Come on. Please, open? [SIGHS] [DOOR BUZZES] Thank you. Thank you so much. My father's working late upstairs, and my cell phone died. Can you buzz him? Please? What's your dad's name? Bob. [DOOR BUZZES] Where is the damn elevator? Shit! We detonate here. So where would you detonate a nuke if you were the Chechens? Wherever I could inflict maximum damage. Listen, I found a credit card receipt in Macabe's house. It's for a dummy corporation that he set up at the Vox and Billing. He's renting space there. What for? If he rents space there, he has access to the corporate helipad. Ah. And that's what you're talking about. Oh, yeah. Maximum damage.That's what I'm talking about. Best way to escape a small nuke has to be in a helicopter. It makes sense, but how did he know they would come here? I think there's somebody else. Who are you working? I was supposed to be on James and his people. But we weren't supposed to make a move. We were just supposed to report his whereabouts. Why? Who did you report to? Only to Greer. There's gotta be another way in here. [SIGHS] Shit. [KEYPAD BEEPS] [DEVICE BLEEPING] We did it. In moments, we will be heroes. [GROANS] Wouldn't want you to set that until I'm safely out of here. Ingenious, how you put this together. You were a good choice, Nicholi. Who the fuck are you? Who do you think could pull off a job like this? Not you, not Aslan. Me! You are nobody. I am everything to you. You are here because I put you here. I created Aslan. I told him to detonate it here. That's who I am. You burn in hell, you pig! [GROANS] Step away from the device. Cold. You don't know what you're doing. I'm after the same ends as you. You don't know who I work for, or who I work with. Now step away from the device now. Don't do anything else. Don't move. Just do that. You know I can still push this button, even with a bullet in me. You're not a martyr, Greer. You don't understand. This has to be done. Step away from the device now. [BEEPS] Check the security desk. There should be an on/off switch for the elevator. Shut it off! I can't. If I touch anything, it might go off. [BEEPING] So, what are we gonna do? I just want to get this away from people. I'll see if I can get up on the roof and in the chopper. [♪♪♪] Okay, thank you very much for everything. Thank you. Now get out. No. Listen, it's too dangerous. I really appreciate you coming. See you later. No. Hang on. [MUTTERS] We're probably gonna die, aren't we? How deep is it? What? How deep do you think the water is here? I don't know, uh... A thousand feet, maybe? Well, that's good. That's good. I was hoping you'd say that. All right, open the door and throw that bitch out. What? Get it out! Okay. Do it now. Okay. Are we gonna make it? I wouldn't count on it. [ALARM BLARES] Oh, Jesus. Are we clear? Well, uh... it looks like we might be, but, uh, we could be glowing in the dark for a while. [SIGHS] COLD: Now, I just kind of wanted to compliment you on a job well done. Hm. Now, what do you mean by that? Well, I mean you did good. Uh... We're both still alive, and you've been a good student and a good friend. A friend? Yeah, a friend. Heh. A friend. First of all, I'm your colleague. And secondly, friend... after all that we've been through together, you're gonna call me a friend? Normally, when people sleep together, they-- What--? What are you talking about? Okay, okay. All right. Uh... Lover? Concubine? Wizard of the three-night stand? "Master of the three-night stand," that's really classy. You know, I don't recall there just being three nights. Oh, whatever, you know. As busy as I am, it's all a blur. Oh. Now, see, I would stop there, because, being your student, you taught me how to use these chopsticks. All right. To friends. I'm sorry, sir. I wasn't reachable. Yes, sir, I am well and intact. Well, thank you, sir, but I was just doing my job. The last time that I saw Cold, he was in a helicopter with the nuke. With all due respect, sir, in all my years of service with the CIA, it's the most courageous act I've ever seen. Guess he had a change of heart. Yeah, I'll have a report on Monday. Sir? The president? Well, I would be honored. No, sir. Just a ticket for one. [♪♪♪]
