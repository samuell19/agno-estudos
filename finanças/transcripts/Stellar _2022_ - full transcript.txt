(Son Ho-jun Lee Kyoo-hyung) (Heo Sung-tae Jeon No-min) Oh no! What do we do?! Excuse me. Do you smoke? Yes... (Director Kwon Soo-kyung) Cheol-gu, hurry! - Get over here! - Grab my hand! All good here! So terrible... (Vehicle Transfer Agreement) I think you dropped this, take this with you. You got the form? Yup, okay! Good! There it is. This car is wild. Good work today, here. What for? - I'm off. - Where? Home, of course. Oh yeah. Dong-sik'll do the delivery, keep that in mind. Piss off, the boss will kill you if he finds out. Just look the other way, I'll take care of it. Hold on. Yeah, I just told Cheol-gu about it. Dong-sik, this is an expensive car. Whatever, man. He hung up on me? That damn. It'll be shipped out in the morning. We're all dead if it's not en route to Cambodia. - Yes, sir. - Stay alert until departure. Get off. I'm begging you. There's nowhere to stay without the van. If it was so important, why did you use it as collateral? It was an urgent matter. For the sake of my child... The car is your hostage, and the child your weapon. You're a terrorist, that's what you are. Sir, this is the only thing I can give you. I'm sorry. My wife is sick! Crap, I'm sure she is! Just look at the husband. You ass! I'll pay it back! You damn! You ass! I hate irresponsible and incompetent fathers the most! For the sake of your child? Then just look at it! Is this how a child should live?! Be ashamed, fool. What's wrong? Had a nightmare? (Cheol-gu) Hello? Why aren't you answering? - I got shot in my dream. - What? Is that a good omen or not? What are you saying? Did Dong-sik call you? He's not answering his phone. Young-bae, are you listening? I think he's ghosting us. He's not reachable! He took off! What?! What happened? Where's the damn car?! I should be asking you that! He's your best friend! Dong-sik, come on, man... If the boss finds out, we're both dead, right? The car is worth $300,000... He'll answer me. What time do we need to load it to the ship? 2 hours ago, 2 hours ago... Crap... You freaking damn! I'll kill you! Hello? Could I speak to Mr. Lee Dong-sik? Who are you? You know him? Where is he? I'm his friend's sister, I need to speak to my brother, but he's not reachable... Young-mi? That moron... Best friend my ass. Best friends are the worst. He still won't answer. Did you forget what he did to us? I know. But we still have to have a funeral. We have got to deal with inheritance too. What inheritance? Wait, inheritance? Does this house go for $300,000 to $400,000? It was rental, he lived in that room. Then what? Insurance? Savings? What's the inheritance? Debt. What? Are you messing with me? Look what you're doing. Do you have any pride? Dad was really sick. He suffered for 5 years before passing away. Why is that any of my business? You want to be like that to dad until the end?! Dad? Who? I don't have one. The person you're calling is unavailable, please leave... Being back in our hometown reminds me of you. We had so much fun when we were young. We played leapfrog and hide-and-seek too... Dude, where are you? Why can't I reach you? Can't get to the phone? All right, then just listen. Just wait till I get my hands on you, fool! (Stellar: A Magical Ride) Welcome! Are these cars all legal? You didn't have to come on your busy day. I told you I'd ship them. The scale of this job is quite overwhelming to a hooligan in the boonies. I prepared a full meal and you just had to scoop it, and yet you managed to mess it up. What will you ship? You lost the merchandise! It's not lost... Either ship it by tomorrow, or bring the merchandise before me. If not, I'm shipping your coffin instead. Find... Park Young-bae! Rock, paper, scissors! Rock, paper, scissors! Nice! $250,000, give me the keys. Money first! Who carries around $250,000 in cash? I'll go transfer the money when I get back, give it. Send it within 30 minutes. Yes, I'll send it in 30 minutes. Okay, I'll send the interest too. Why did he keep that stupid car? They must be your friends. - I was afraid no one would come. - Leave. You boys are all dolled up. You look strong. - Keep a lookout. - Yes, sir. Take good care of him! I'll let you two chat freely. Young-mi! Hey! Thank you so much for coming, boss. You must be devastated. I'm all right, sir. I'm devastated too. Boss! So, the original plan was, a car was bound for... Sihanoukville, Cambodia. It should've been on the ship today. Lamborghini Huracan Rosso Mars, a stunning supercar. I was going to sell it and buy my second child a piano. Anyway... My family would've been very happy today. Had you not stolen it. Boss, it's a misunderstanding, it really is! What happened was... I left it with a friend who runs a consignment company... You left it to a friend? Then he disappeared! I know this sounds like crap. Believe me, it really wasn't me! Easy, easy. Not the hand. We need his fingerprint for organ harvest agreement. Take his kidneys and liver. Let's go. Boss, one moment... Even if I die... please let my father have his funeral! So that you could run off? Mr. Jung! What kind of a son would run off on his father's funeral? You. Father... Father... Why isn't the chief mourner greeting the guests? Get in here! That's what I'm saying... Father... Take that fool's car key and wallet. Car key's in my jacket pocket... And wallet's over here... Where are you touching? Father... Sir. I saw a move yesterday, do you want to see it? Don't be shocked, okay? Where did you learn that move? Practice, moron, practice. Like hell you did. Whatever, crap... I can't die on an empty stomach. Hope you don't mind sharing. Wow, is this really our car? Don't touch, it's my car. The son must have worked hard. It ain't easy for colleagues to stay up all night. Where did he go? Wake up, fool! Find Park Young-bae! Park Young-bae! Park Young-bae! - Search the car! - Yes, sir! Park Young-bae! Where did he go? Where the hell is he? Let's go, let's go! Come on, let's go! So stuffy... Eh? It's hot! Why is the heater on? I want to go fast too. Just walk, why don't you! Dammit, I can hear you! What the... Moron! So embarrassing... Jesus Christ! Honk at me, why don't you? Holy cow! You met your match, you're so dead. What the hell? What's wrong with this? I don't believe it... What a stupid car... That did it, that's it! What the... I could have died... Get over here! You son of a wench! That's why you should always drive under the limit. What now? (Cheol-gu) Look who it is. It's the fool who tattled to the boss. I thought he'd go easy since you're mourning. Who? The boss? You know many families he forced into mourning. Where are you going? To Seocheon, of course, to that prick's home. Wait, are you going to sell me out again? Come on, what do you take me for?! I won't sell out my friend until I get stabbed in the neck! He's off to Seocheon. Good morning, ma'am. Are you here for Dong-sik? Is he here? That's too bad, he took off with his kids. Don't lie to me. How could I look after them like this? Where did he go? One second. What about it? Go empty and clean this piss pot before I forget. You really don't know? I'm dead serious! - 041-343... - Wait! Wait! - 041-343... - 5345. You're so dead... Where am I calling? This is Lightning Chinese Food. - What? - They don't deliver 1 dish. Stay for a meal while at it. Do I look like I got time to eat noodles?! Here. Even if you're busy, you still have got to eat. Give his ex a call. Think about it. Even if they got divorced, he'd have called for help. Su-hyun? Eh? I got no time for this. Oh my... You got a weird way of getting into the car. What is it? Ma'am, it's okay! It's okay! Take them with you. Don't starve yourself on the road, you hear? Oh my, isn't this your dad's car? I missed this thing. Is your dad doing well? My goodness. - Take care, ma'am. - Drive safe, dear. Bye. He probably did it to pay off the loan shark. He even borrowed from a loan shark? Threats every day, so much profanity... Why is living so hard? Park Woong-ryul, are you inside? He's got time to make this but not pay his debt? He has time to educate his kids? Mom, I'm scared... Mercedes... Mercedes. 3588. Why won't it go in?! Boss, good morning. Your friend's mother is so full of love. You're not assuming that I fled, right? That's what you believe? Jesus, I feel so wronged! I came here to find the car, that's why I'm here! Boss, I'm so close. I'm sorry, sir. All right, let's go see the car. Oh yeah! He must be so tired looking everywhere for the car. Honestly, let him rest his legs. It's okay. Cut them off nicely and put them in the trunk. Yes, sir. Let's give your legs a rest. Cut them off nicely and let them rest? What do you mean by that? Ow, ow! That hurts! I thought we were taking your Mercedes! It's a misunderstanding! Sorry. I'll just take my car! Let me do that! I'll drive! Misunderstanding! Get up. It hurts so much! Okay, I'll walk! - Quick! - Okay, okay! Hey, hey! Watch out! What the hell? Mercedes! Move it! Open the door, fool! It won't budge! Move your car! Come on! Go on! Hurry! - Hurry up! - Hurry the hell up! Move it! Out of the way! Rub it off. Should I just go? I'm going to go then. Get in, you morons! What a jalopy! What's going on? Turn it off! Dammit! What the hell was that?! Stop right there! I'm so dead... Move your ass! Crap, I almost died... You can't! Just stop... You want to die, punk? Don't blink up my ass! I'm sorry, sorry. - Get out. - I didn't do it on purpose. Not getting out? I really didn't do it on purpose! I said get out. Park Young-bae, come out. Bud, can't you see I'm talking to him? Come on out. One, two, three, four, five, so scary! What the hell's happening here? What's wrong with this? This isn't the time for this! Backku, that idiot. What? What should I do? Just go? Whatever! Park Young-bae! Stop right there! Park Young-bae! I've crossed the point of no return. Park Young-bae. You crossed the point of no return. Please, turn it off, I can't stand it. Please, please, you idiot! Toll gate? Oh yeah, they took my wallet, what do I do? 1 dollar 20 cents, please. What? - 2 dollars 40 cents, please. - What? Aren't you with that car just now? What?! See that? It felt so natural, right? I'm so smart, right?! S-M-A-R-T! Who am I talking to? Get it together, Young-bae! Stretch your front. (Idiot) Stretch it a bit more. That's very good. You son of a... Did you see the PTK? PTK? Permission To Kill? Pregnancy test kit, fool! Let's talk about that later, I'm in a rush, send me some money, I'm penniless. You said your dad was ass, right? The way I look at it, you're the real ass! Are you okay? Breathe out and relax... Let's see... There's nothing here? There's really nothing here... Not a damn penny, and so damn loud. Why won't this turn off? I just don't get it! What's with you? What's the matter? Holy cow! All right, I won't touch, I'm sorry. Sorry... Christ... Whatever, I'll just sleep it off. Oh man... If you're going to play music, can't you play something soft? Yesterday... the stars fell... Do you like it here more than home? Dad, here, I'll give this to you. Son, do you know what 'Stellar' is? Nope. Star. Star? People have their own stars. This car is our family's star. I'll work really hard with this car, and let my little stars do everything you ever wanted. Really? Then can I get Taekwon-V, Dooli doll and Super Comboy? Can I watch baseball games at the stadium... Sir, you haven't clocked out yet? I'm going to head home, good night. There aren't any cars, just turn it around. U-turn is not permitted here, if we go up a bit... I know you're playing a trick to run up the meter! Sir, you can't do that... Positive thoughts, positive thoughts... All right, let's think. If the loan shark's still calling, it means he hasn't paid him off. So he hasn't sold the car yet, at the very least, he has the money. Right? It makes sense, right? Who am I talking to? At the very least, he'll have the money. He should, right? Hot! That's so damn hot! Hey, Su-hyun, go ahead. I got a call from Jae-ah. Mom! - Really? - Yeah. - Where are they? - Ocean. Wait a minute, ocean? So, our country is surrounded by ocean on 3 sides. - What are you saying? - Su-hyun. You call that a tip? They must be near a mudflat. She said she fell in and ruined her clothes. Hot! What are you doing?! - Mudflat, eh? - Yeah, mudflat. So, I just need to search West Sea and South Sea. I don't believe this... It's working, it's working. Young-bae, are you listening? If I search really hard, it'll take 18 days or so. That's a shame, I'll be dead by tomorrow. She called from a payphone, you can call the number back. Why didn't you tell me earlier?! Hold on a second. Hot, hot, hot! - What are you doing? - So hot! What's the number? - 041... - 041... Are you writing this down? - 433... - 433... 4333. I'm telling you because I worried for the kids. He's cornered, he could do anything. Find him and call me back, you hear me? I'm cornered too... (Chungcheongnam-do) Come on! Nothing's going my way. Does this even work? At least it turns on. Address search... Chungcheongnam-do... Guide. Please work, please work... - Initiating navigation. - Okay! Lovely voice! Very nice! We had some shipping snafu. The product is safe, so I'll have it on the next vessel. Sir, I think you should tell Park Young-bae... so that he understands the gravity of this situation. Make a left turn in 10m. Another one? That's all I've been doing. I chose the beach, but you're leading to the forest! Left turn coming up. There's no road, I can't do a left turn! Where are you taking me? Left turn coming up. Where? Where?! Drive straight. No road... There's no road ahead... Drive straight. Drive straight. You prick! Please make a U-turn. Are you thieve? Yes, I mean no. Well, what am I? It take 1 hour wait for bus. Tank you. Not at all. You gave me all these corn. Where are you from? Cambodia. Oh, Cambodia, Sihanoukville port? You know? I know it so well, know it to death, actually. - Pardon? - It's nothing. How do you like living here? We alive because we can't die. Our cabbage harvest ruined last year so we got debt, when rains, it pours, my hubby get lumbar sprain and is in bed. Lumbar sprain... They said, if family happy, everything good. Right, that saying... - Tank you! - You're welcome. Here you go, enjoy! I'll give you everything, let me have 1 corn dog. Look at this car. Isn't this a jalopy? Stupid punks... - Take a picture. - One, two, three! Mr. Jung! I found the Stellar. Wait, look, Young-bae's in the background! Where? Show me. If you zoom in, you can see him! Holy crap, that's him, sir! - He's got great eyes. - Thank you. Like. Come with us, fool No, I'll go back to the office and wait for Young-bae's call... (Youngnam Alps National Guide Book) Holy cow! Come on, man! Blinking solves everything? He's sorry. When you're sorry or thankful, but can't tell him, you turn this on. I'm sorry, blink, blink. Thank you, blink, blink. - Want to try? - Yeah! I'm sorry, blink, blink. Thank you, blink, blink. Finally, it's the ocean... 041-434-4333. Dong-sik... Just stay here for 10 more minutes. Excuse me, ma'am. Have you seen a 5-year-old, 7-year-old and their dad? Have you seen a 5-year-old boy with a bowl cut? A boy with bowl cut. Yeah, I've seen them playing over there. - There? - Yes. - Thank you, thank you! - Okay, bye. I found you, fool. Son of a wench! You're so dead... It's uncle Young-bae! (Dong-sik Consignment) You're not getting away, you son of a... Jae-ah! Hold onto your brother and the seatbelt. Okay! So close... All right, you damn. Stop the truck! Stop it, you fool! Stop the truck! Hey, hey! Dong-sik, speed up, hurry! Go! Hey, hey! That was... - Turn it around. - Yes, boss! Dammit! Faster, faster! My belly! I'm so dead... What's that? It's not paved? (Under Construction) Wait a minute, my belly! The road... Stop, stop! You can't come in here! Didn't you see the sign?! It's all over... Move your truck! You crazy damn! Hey! Stop! Crazy asswipe! Backku! Back up! Crap, I'm so dead... Backku, go faster! Backku! Move it! I'm so sorry! Dammit, am I going to die?! Space travel, space travel... Backku, you can't drive for crap! He can't drive for crap! Stop backing up! Take the side road! Dong-sik, you damn... Please! Please! That did it. Why aren't you going?! The car won't start! Why is this car so lame? Get over here. Korean cars are built better... Shut it! Where does... Park Young-bae's girl work? Did I lose them? I don't see them. I'm safe. Eh? What is it now? What's wrong with you? Don't do that. If you were hungry, you should've said so... but I got no money... Who are you? Let's go to the farm over that road. Farm? Why there? I have to feed my cows. This is not a cab. It's not? It sure looks like it. It definitely looks retro. Then please get out, I'm really busy. Why don't I pay you for a ride? What do you take me for? Gramps! I'll pay double. How much will you pay? Is there a gas station nearby? Gramps, push a bit harder! Push it! Keep going! Give me back $10 while I ask nicely. LPG? You didn't know? Wasn't this a taxi before? If you go up about 700m, there's an LPG station. Okay! Let's go, gramps! The sun will set soon, move faster, will you?! I'm coming! Wait... Gramps! Help! I'm tipping! What a moron. Why do I have to do this?! I brought you here in the end! Half of that was me pushing you and the car! I have to get this done today. So many damn cows. I raised my children thanks to these guys! Got any kids? Not everyone's fit to be a dad. Are people born with a permit to have children? When you play with them, and live with them, you end up being a dad to them! The day's over... Let's go have a drink at my place and sleepover. I'm really busy, I have to go. Shut up and follow me! I'll get you a new pair of undies! And my prized shirt too, get a move on! Gramps, do you live alone? It's been 2 years. Who knew that shrew would leave me like that. Gramps, could I introduce you to a nice granny? I know someone who might be just your type. She mixes noodles like you too. Don't give me that nonsense. Is she hot? So sexy. Leave me her phone number. I'll do a phone blind date. Only thieving scumbags call at this hour. You son of a cow! I sold my cows for you only a few days ago! Hello? Look who it is! It's my Princess Ye-jin! My dear Ye-jin wants to ride in an Audi? Put your daddy on the phone. He doesn't want to answer? Of course, deary. What? Weren't you breaking up with me? I had some work to do. Did you have dinner? Does it look like I got appetite? Don't be that way, make sure to eat. They say babies eat away mom's body. You'll regret it if you don't eat. I have got to go. This idiot only says what he wants to say! This cigarette tastes like crap. A permit should be a requirement. Not everyone's fit to be a parent. Honey, don't do this... This is the only way for both of us to live. Let's get a divorce, please! Honey, please! You're the head of this family now. The person you're calling is unavailable, please leave... Dad! Mom is really sick, she just went into surgery. We need to pay for it and a guardian too. Please come to the hospital when you hear this. Mom's dead... It's all your fault. You are dead to me. You happy? Happy?! So happy now? Huh?! Are you happy to see me in this mess?! Satisfied? Huh? Does it make you happy to see me live like this? (Sung-hee) Really? Video chat now? All right. Yeah, what is it? Park Young-bae, where are you? Give me that. Boss... Why are you there... Congrats on becoming a dad. Listen, Park Young-bae. I'll give you 3 hours, bring the car, if you want to live long enough to know if it's a boy or a girl. Hello? You goddamn animals... You messed with my family? Dong-sik, listen carefully. Do you see the number I'm calling from? I'm at your mom's. If you don't call in an hour, I cannot guarantee her safety. She's already in shock after hearing what you did... Ma'am, are you okay? Please get up! Ma'am! Stop calling me! Could I get some more kimchi? Your kimchi is incredible. Don't resent your dad so much. You think he wanted to leave you all behind? Some people can't change their destiny, like my son Dong-sik. Why did he have to take after my neighbor and not his dad? No way, it's not what you think! I wasn't thinking anything. Mom! - That fool's here! - Mom! Mom! Dong-sik! Get out of here! You are dead! Come here! My kids are watching! - Let go! - Get over here! You guys... What are you two doing?! Give me the car! How could you scam me! Friends give each other breaks! Friends? Friends don't take advantage of each other! You stupid morons! Why are you hitting just me?! Why me? Stop right there! At least spread out the peppers! - Stop! - You punks! You are dead. Where's the car?! Give me 2 years, I'll pay you back! Without that car, I won't last a few hours! Beat me up all you want, then give me some time. Dong-sik, dude! Don't you get it? I won't press charges, so return my car. Where is it? I gave it to a broker. What? Are you out of your goddamn mind?! You ass! Then give me the money! He must've paid you! I haven't received it yet... You haven't? You ass! Don't hit him! My dad is a good person! I hate you, uncle! You're ass! Daddy! Don't cry, it's okay. Daddy's fine. Give me the key. What? Your truck, fool! We have got to get $50,000! $50,000 for both vehicles, it's non-negotiable. Actually, a film set nearby asked for one recently. But the door's busted, - and a side mirror's taped up... - Come on... All right, $50,000 it is. Bring permits and other documents to my office. All scratched up... I'm so jealous, you'll be a movie star. Don't cause any trouble there, and don't high beam at everything. Keep your side mirror on, and if you hit a top actor, you'll be totaled instantly. Who are you talking to? Screw you, moron! The permit... No way... The permit's not here. Could it be at home? Home? What a dick. Don't put on an act. You think I'd take pity on you? Hunted by the debt, wife ran away, embarrassed in front of my kids. It was so easy becoming a dad, but living as one is so hard. Put out that cigarette. So messed up... When your father first got this car, you were bragging so much. You wanted 10 cents to touch it. Now it's almost jalopy. Jalopy? Why is it a jalopy? So much better than you, you wouldn't sell for $5,000! What a load of crap... Don't you smell barbecue? Hey, stop fidgeting! Fire, fire! There's a fire! - Put it out! - Fire! - Put it out! - Hey! I can't see! Look at the road! Don't climb up there! Just stop the car! Get out! Go! Get out! Put out the fire! Put it out! Piss! Piss on the fire! It looks like grilled eggs, right? We got toasted corn too... - Is it good? - Delicious. Are you okay? Not injured? - Yeah, we were lucky. - So lucky. Why the hell did you smoke in the car?! Imagine how hot it was! I'll kill you! Die! It's tinted so well. Not another word, keep your mouth shut! Fool, shut the hell up! Let's just ride quietly. Christ... Back window's all blacked out, feel free to use it. Don't touch me. - Get out. - Why? Didn't you see it earlier? My door won't open. What a piece of crap... Are you out of your mind? Are you nuts? Why did you kick the door? What's with you? Forget it, just check if you got the money. I'm really sad... Park Young-bae! How could the chief mourner not stay for the funeral? I know. Who were those people? Not your friends, right? What are you doing? - Where is it... - What are you doing? (Prescription Drugs Park Woong-ryul) Where is it? Whenever your father drank, (Vehicle Permit) he'd wail and regret being a few days late... He resented himself for letting your mother die. He even sold his kidney to pay for her surgery. That medicine was for his complications. He was in a bad shape for so long. His last wish was for you two to forgive him. I don't know why I'm telling you this. He's already gone... That pitiful soul... Holy cow! What the hell are you doing? Are you serious? I deserve to die... I'm sorry, Young-bae... (Will) What's this? Will? Jesus Christ... I think he took off with the car payment... What did you say? He hasn't transferred, he's not answering my calls... - Dong-sik, get out of there. - What? Why? You won't die like that, you have got to do it this way! Die! Useless piece of crap! Who did you sell it to? Du-bong introduced me to a broker... Are you insane enough to trust someone he introduced?! I've had it! I called over a hundred times... Shut the hell up! I called him so many times, he didn't answer... - It's pointless. - Du-bong, it's Young-bae. - What? Give me that! - Stay put! Dong-sik said he sold a car to your broker friend. Is that right? All right, I'll come over. So? What happened? He said it was returned! Is that so? That's what happened? No wonder I didn't get the money, so that's why... Shut your hole! I don't get fooled so easi... Shut it, shut it! Young-bae says he'll come over. Yeah? Keep him there until we arrive. His name is Du-bong? Yes. He hooks up brokers with stolen cars, he worked on the car not knowing it was ours. But why was it returned? I'm sure he had a good reason. You poor things. - Du-bong! - Yeah? What happened to your broker? It's all right. What happened? I know, I know. It got returned for some reason, but don't you worry, I took care of it! Everyone around me are traitors... Yeah, you must feel terrible. Shut the hell up. Where are we heading? Where else? Hell. What? Really? Stop yapping and turn around. - Why? - Try to untie me. You're pinching my skin! - Did it work? - Up higher. - Spread out! - Yes, sir! Boss! I found it! It's about time... - Pull out the car! - Right away! Almost done... That did it! What do we do now? What else, get out of here. - It stopped. - Get the trunk open. Hold on a second. Found it! At the count of three, you know what to do. One, two, three! - Dong-sik, go! - Let's go! How did you free yourself? Why aren't you getting out? What's up? Scoot over. - Dong-sik. - Yeah? - We're dead. - Why? It's hell outside. - Want to see? - I don't want to. Good evening, boss. Wow, you found the car! You damn, where have you been?! Sir! After receiving the car, something caught my eye, so I looked into it further... Tada! This was inside. How dare you touch my stuff?! Touch my stuff?! What's that? What are they doing? Dong-sik. At the count of three, got it? Got it. One, two, - three! - Don't kill me! You ass! Please don't kill me! It's all my fault! I'm so sorry! Please forgive us this time, it won't ever happen again! He's right, I agree with him! Please, please... Of course it won't happen again. - Thank you! - Thank you so much! Thank you! Thank you! You'll have to be alive... for stuff like that to happen again, no? Pardon? What's going to happen to them? What's going on over there? Who are those guys? Why are you causing a scene at my place of work? Thugs? What? Thugs? But you are. Dang. Boys! Why are they brawling? Get in, close the door quietly. How could you slam it?! What do we do?! Where did it go? - Start the car! Go! - Pull them out! They really are dead now... Boss, it's a misunderstanding, I wasn't trying to flee, I was going to park... You must be devastated. I'm devastated too when I look at you. Go get Cheol-gu. Jackass, don't move! Don't come any closer! What's this? What is that? - What is it? - Put that down! - What is it? - Put it down! What is that, fool! LSD! Drug! - Drug? - Supercar! What? Drug? Why did you tell him?! Drug? Now I get it... Now I understand why you were so desperate to find the car! With that car under my name, if it's caught, I'd go to jail! Dong-sik, grab everything! I'll kill you! Don't come any closer, I'm going to kill him! - Dong-sik, hurry up! - Okay, okay! Go get him! - I'm sorry, sir! - Don't you dare move! No! No! Screw you all! Don't come any closer! Stay back! Just stop it, Young-bae. I'm going to rip them all up... Put them down. Even if you die, die in one piece. If I have to die, I'll take you all with me. Dammit! Let go! What do we do... Bring him. Sir, there's no more traffic, should we call it a night? Should we? Let's head back... What's that? A car? Why is it so slow? What is it? I think it's drug! - What? Drug? - 2309! He's driving away! Call for back up at once! Okay... No! No! Don't kill us! Please! All taken care of. I did everything you asked for! 2309 Stellar, this is your last warning! If you do not stop, we'll open fire! Last warning! He wants to go all the way? What was that? Did he shoot at us? Yes, I think so! 11, 11, requesting immediate support! Drug and weapon possession, requesting support! - Stay right on him! - Okay. Hey, step on it! Stellar is heading for the port, requesting support! What do we do now? What about my kids? - Finish it up. - Yes, sir. Toss them in. My kids... What's with the jalopy? Why is that here... Eh? The door opens? No one's here. Don't move! Hands up! Nobody move! Crap... That ass! You think you can escape? You damn... That damn... Good, you did good. You wouldn't sell out your friend until you get stabbed, huh? There was a knife on my neck! Is that so, fool?! I'm sorry. Go on and dig in. We have to send off your father. Do you remember? What? When your father visited us a month ago... I did so many terrible things to him. I couldn't stand by him when he needed his dad. Thank you for being by his side. He went through so much. May I... clean him instead? What did you say? You two have the same blood type, please get tested. You're asking me to give him my kidney? Did that man order you? He's in the last stage, if he doesn't get a transplant, that's the end of him. Dad, I'm sorry... Then tell him to just die. If I was him, I'd have died before causing others more pain. What did he ever do for me? Give him my kidney? Why should I?! Father! Goddammit! What should I?! Dad, I'm sorry... Yesterday... the stars fell... Huh? What's going on? What's wrong with this? - What happened? - It's smoking. Is this car going to blow up? It's smoking a lot! I don't understand, it's got a full tank. Wait a minute, hold on, guys. It won't start either. Yeah, you have got to cause some trouble every now and then. You were driving this car around? Yes. It was driving fine until a moment ago. You're not making any sense. Did I carry this car around then? What's the problem? There's not a single drop of engine oil, how could it run? What? Engine would've caught fire, and this car torched. Putting in engine oil is useless now. You should total it. Sir. Please sign here. Here you go. You're all set. My dream is gone, and sorrow deepens... My star is gone... Dad, what's that? It's an emergency light. When you're sorry or thankful, but can't tell others, you turn this on. I'm sorry, blink, blink. Thank you, blink, blink. Wait! (Stellar: A Magical Ride) (Director Kwon Soo-kyung) Why won't it turn off again? So much damn traffic... Can't you go any faster?! All right, all right, I'm trying! Let go, please! Sorry, sorry! Sorry! Are you okay? I'm fine...
