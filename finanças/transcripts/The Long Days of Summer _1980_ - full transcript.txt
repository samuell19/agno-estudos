- [SINGING] Oh beautiful,for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain. For purple mountains majesty,above the fruited plains. America, America, God shed his grace on thee. - Bridgeport, Connecticut, wherewe all started out together-- me, and Charlie Wilson, andHowie Martin, and Dave Zimmer, and Marty Albert, and ofcourse, my little sister Sarah. It seems 1,000 summers havecome and gone since then, yet the memories willalways remain and need only be touched to return as clearand as bright as yesterday. And so it is that even now, whenI feel the softness of a summer breeze, or see a familiar pattern of shadows play across the ground, orhear a little girl's laugh, I am easily transported backto that time of innocence and adventure, when life was yet to be lived and the days of our youthwould go on forever. [kids cheering] - Oh, look who's coming up, Joe. Cooper! He can't hit the side of a barn. - All right, you got him,you got him, you got him. Swing! [bam] [kids yelling] - Lucky hit, Cooper. - You're a real sport, Landauer. [kids jeering] - Hey, batter, swing! - Yeah! - Run, run, run! - Come on, throw him out!Hurry up! Throw him out! Hurry up, throw him out! - I got it. - Retired. [kids quiet down] - Hey, what gives? - Come on, get him! [kids yelling] [fighting] OK, OK. - Go! Let him go. - Come on, that's enough. That's enough. - Aw, let him go, Mr. Dowd. I won't hurt him too bad.- Yeah, let us go. He's got it coming. - Hey, this is a baseballgame, not a boxing match. You guys really want to fight? Sign up for the Gloves. It's you and your Golden Gloves. I run the program so I can see to it that you and Freddy meet in thefirst round of the tournament. - That's just swell with me, Mr. Dowd. - Sure, I'll sign up. - OK, OK. Now, I got to go back to the school. You guys drop by later andpick up your applications. And the rest of you guys, clear out. Come on, scram. It's all over. All over! - You still going to showup Saturday night, Cooper? - Sure, why not? - Good, just bring the $5. Come on, you guys. - Get out of here. - Boy, he's some creep. - Hmm. - Yeah. Dan, you sure you know what you're doin'? [music playing] One, two, three. - [SINGING] We are theMerry Makers, happy and gay. We try to help in every way. We are not good cooks, nor sewers, nor bakers. We are just the Merry Makers. - Sarah, there's your father. - Hi, father. - Hello, sweetheart. It's good to see you. - How come you're home so early? - Well, even lawyers getto play hooky now and then. Well, I see the Merry Makersare having their weekly meeting. - Hi Mr. Cooper. - Hi, Joyce, Norma May, Margie, June. - Oh, Mr. Cooper, Mrs. Cooperwould like you to bring up the table in the front hall. - OK, Clementine. See you girls later. - Oh, father. Duane was painting my picture again. Guess he's going to give it to you again instead of the rent, huh, father? - Well, now, Sarah, these are hard times, and Duane is an artist. Besides, you wait, and you'll see. I bet those pictures aregoing to be worth a lot more than a little rent. [giggles] Say, hey, cupcakes. - Sure, father. [music playing] - Hiya. - Hi, Francis. - How are you? - Fine, fine. - You look terrific today. - Oh, thank you. - Duane, look. It's a letter from Paris.- Hello, Duane. - Hi Ed. Sarah's new painting is coming along just fine. - Oh, good, good. It will be a nice additionto our collection. [muttering to herself] Three, three, three. [mumbling] - Hello, darling. Did you have a good day? - Yes, I had a very-- - If Grace Romby doesn't likethese, I'll eat the cake. Aren't they just lovely? - They're beautiful. Millie, I got it. - She has been driving mecrazy with accent pieces. We don't even have the painters yet. Do you know where I found these? - Sweetheart, I said I got it. - Yes, I see it, darling. It's all right, you can put itdown over there if you'd like. I don't know, I think her... [mumbling] You got it? You got it?! Why didn't you tell me? [laughing] - I've been trying! You are looking at thenew outside legal counsel for that giant of Bridgeportindustry, Wiggin and Wade. - Oh, I'm so proud of you. - Shall I pour the champagne? - By all means. There's something more. I checked into theavailability of that, uh, beachfront property. Hm? It's still there. - Oh gosh, you wouldn't kid me? - Would I kid you? - Oh, Ed. The beach. - Mhm. Salute. - Cheers. Anyways, she expected me to do for them what I did in the Kelly Lason case. I said I'm not too sure I can accomplish it. - Oh, Dad, I signed up for theJunior Golden Gloves today. - Golden Gloves? - You-- you did what? - I signed up. - Well, just unsign up. [water pouring] - Aw, mom, come on! It's not exactly like fighting. They have it every year. It's like baseball, or any sport. - It is not like any sport. It's like fighting. Let's not discuss this now. - Speaking of fighting, Sam Wiggin invited us to dinnerSaturday night at his house. Hm, hm? - Oh. - We're going to listen tothe Louis-Schmeling fight. - Who you think is going to win it, Dad? - The Brown Bomber! You can bet your house on it. - You bet money on Louis? - Who, me? Don't you know that a fooland his money are soon parted? - And only a fool wages hard-earned money. - Oh, guess what? Our class is going to theBridgeport station in three weeks to see President Roosevelt. And Mrs. Broderick saysthat seeing the President is like watching history while it happens. - President Roosevelt? In Bridgeport, Connecticut? - Mhm. - Yeah, it's called, uh, um-- - A whistle stop. - That's it! How'd you know? [chuckles] - Dinner on Louis and you hush. - Who's for peach cobbler? [music playing] - Hi. - Hi. Boy, you're really gettingquite a collection. How old's this one? - Since when are you interested in my stamps? - Can't a guy be interestedin his own sister's stamp collection? - All right, Daniel. What do you want? - Who me? I don't want anything. - Daniel. - Oh right, I need a buck. One lousy buck. - A dollar?! - A dollar. - Where's your money? You get more allowance than I do. - Well, look, it's just a loan. I'll even sign an IOU. - Like the last time,and the time before that? - What-- what if I promised togive you back $1.50 Saturday night? - How are you going to do that? - Cross my heart. Loan me the dollar, and Saturday night you'll be a half a buck richer. - Saturday night... Daniel Cooper, you're bettingon the fight, aren't you? Shh! Not so loud, will you? - You heard what mother said. - I know, I know, but Ican't do anything about it. - Why? - Well, because Freddy Landauertold to put up or shut up today. He didn't leave us any choice. It's for five dollars. - Five dollars? - Shh. - [QUIETER] Five dollars? - Yeah. See, we each put up a buck,unless I have to chicken out because I can't get the dough. - All right, Daniel, but this is the last time. [music playing] [change clinking] - Thanks. - Who are we betting on? - Joe Louis. But don't worry, he's a cinch. You heard Clementine, didn't you? - Come on, Joe Louis. - Well, my temper had me in a jam. I had to figure some way to get mother and father to let me box Freddy Landauerbut I didn't know how. Anyway, it was Saturday night. Joe Louis was going to fight Max Schmeling for the heavyweightchampionship of the world, and me and the guys wereeither going to win or lose an awful lot of money. - Sarah, there's onething about your mother-- she's always worth waiting for. - Sarah, I'll be in to seeyou tonight when I come home. Don't eat too many of Clementine's cookies you can't sleep. Thank you, darling. [somber music] - Can I help you? - Oh, please, yes. Is this the house of Mr. Haley?- Yes. Yes, he lives downstairs.I'm Ed Cooper. We live upstairs. - My name is Josef Kaplan. - Mr. Kaplan. - I'm afraid I took the wrong bus. - This, uh, this is my daughter,Sarah, and, uh, my wife, Mrs. Cooper. - How do you do. - Josef Kaplan. Sarah, why don't you showMr. Kaplan to the door. - Sure, father. Bye, mother. - Bye, darling. - Bye, father. Come on, Mr. Kaplan. We're going to listen to thefight with Duane and Francis. We are for Joe Louis. - Ah, I see. [german folk music] - Maybe we shouldn't go in. - Well, we're here, and we're going in. - What are you kids doing here? [music grows louder] Herbert! Heinrich! - Well, if it isn't Cooper. What do you know? You showed up. [chatter] [clinking of glass] - A toast to Ed Cooper,and a long and profitable association. - Here, here. - Thank you, sir. Thank you, thank you. - So tell me, how do yourchildren like the school they're going to? - Oh, just fine. Really fine, Tom. - It's fight time. We'll take our after dinnerdrinks in the living room. - I've been looking forwardto this fight for a long time. - Who do you think is going to win, Ed? - Uh, check with me in an hour, Sam. - A Kraut or a Darky? Heh, swell difference. Oh, I'll tell you, where's Dempsey now that we need him, huh? Ooh, have a cigar. [radio tuning] - 15 rounds for the world'sheavyweight championship. Weighing 193, wearing purple trunks, outstanding contender for heavyweight honors, the former heavyweighttitle holder, Max Schmeling. [cheering] [fight bell rings] Weighing 198 and 3/4, wearing black trunks, the famous Detroit Brown Bomber,world's heavyweight champion, Joe Louis. [cheering] - And now, ladies and gentlemen,as referee, Arthur Donovan calls both principals to the far side of the ring for final instructions. This is Ed Farmerson speaking, and we give you now Clem McCarthy. - And the old slogan ofboxing, may the best man win, and she's about to start withthis Yankee Stadium packed to the doors. [fight bell rings] - And there we are. - Get him, Max. - And they get up to the ring right together with Arthur Donovan stepping around them, and Joe Louis is in the centerof the ring, Max going around. Joe Louis led quick with twostraight lefts to the chin, and Louis hooks a left to Max's head quickly, and shoots over ahard right to Max's head. Louis-- - Stay away from him! Stay away! - A right to his head. - Come on, Max! - Max! - Louis with the old one-two,and there Max Schmeling caught him with his-- - Yeah, Max! [cheers] [whistles] - Now, Max is backing away against the ropes. Louis is following him, andwatching for that chance. He is prodding Schmeling.- Watch the right. Watch the right! Watch the right! - And missed the right. Louis then cuts him with twostraight lefts to the face, and brought over that hard right to the head, and Louis missed with a left swing, but in close brought up a hard right [cheering] to the jaw, and again, a right to the body. A left hook. - Come on, Louis! - Right and left to the head. A left to the jaw. A right to the head. A left hook to the jaw, and Schmeling is down. The count is five. [kids cheering] Six, seven, eight. The men are in the ring. The fight is over. [cheering] Max Schmeling is-- [bam] [crash] [glass shatters] That nigger fought dirty! You heard it! The nigger fought dirty! - Scram, Cooper, whileyou're still in one piece. - Where's the $5? - You heard me, beat it! - Come on, Dan. Yeah, Dan. Forget about the dough. We had a bet. - You bet on that fight? - Yeah, pop, but I-- - Don't "yeah pop" me! If you lose, you pay. You hear me?! If a Landauer loses, he pays. Let this be a lesson to you. All of you. Never bet with a Jew. Now, get out of here. Go on. - What's he yelling at us for? How do you mean "Jews"? - Yeah! [music playing] - Sunday morning, and likealways, we were on our way home from Katz's delicatessenwith breakfast and the paper. We all felt good about the fight, especially Sarah. She just won her first $0.50. - Hi, Ed. - Hey, Duane. - Can I see you for a minute?- Sure. Uh, tell your mother I'll be up in a minute. - Look, surely you can see that this it is very important for the American people to hear the truth. - Hard to believe, isn't it, Ed? The Nazis are actually running a people just because they're Jews, and herding them into concentration camps. - No, no, death camps. Death camps, and it is not only Jews. - This is just... You know, y-you hearwhispers, you hear rumors, an occasional article is written, but this is almostimpossible to comprehend. - Compared to-- to this, theSpanish Inquisition was-- was but the playing of children. America is our last hope, Mr. Cooper. If your PresidentRoosevelt would speak out, the world would listen. Unfortunately, there is not much time. Every day, every hour is precious. [clinks] - Do you think he knows what he's talking about? I mean, concentration camps, people dying. It's-- it's too incredible. - Yeah, he knows. He knows. His wife died in a concentration camp. He-- he escaped. That's the only reason he's here. His little girls are still hiding in France. [sighs] He knows. - I can't think about it. It's too horrible to think about. - Yeah, I know. I told him I'd make some calls. - It is man's history, and his tragedy, too. There are too many times hehas stood by, saying nothing, while watching a monster that would destroy him. - Well, father did make some calls. But the truth is, no one really wanted to hear what Josef had to say. - Hitler and Mussolini. Remember those names. - Looking back now, it's hard to believe, but no one knew very much yetabout the Nazis or Hitler, and I guess they didn't care. One of the problems was that itwas all happening so far away, and the other was the Depression. People had their owntroubles right here at home, and that included me. Anyway, after a while, itseemed like everyone just lost interest, even father. But Josef kept speaking, andwe got on with our lives. [kids arguing] - Hey, it's my turn. - Want the ball? Come on, Iggy. - Come on, Iggy. Get the ball. - Get the ball, Iggy. - Come on, get it, Iggy. - Uh-oh. - You know the fight is almost here. - Yeah, so what? - So how's about another bet? Double or nothing, $10. Only this time, it's you and me. - What for? You didn't want to pay up the last time. - That's cuz the nigger fought dirty. What's the matter, Cooper? Chicken? - Hey, why don't you knock it off, Landauer. We knew you almost won the division last year. - So what? I thought Cooper here thought hewas some sort of a Barney Ross. Ross was a real fightin' Jew. - OK, Landauer, you got it. - Start saving up your dough, Cooper. - You better. - Come on, you guys, let's get out of here. This place stinks. - Oh boy, Daniel. You really got us into it this time. - But why not, mom? A lot of the other guys are in it. - No, Daniel. I gave you my reasons. - But-- - Please, Daniel, I don't want the people that I love to fight otherpeople for no reason. - Oh, mom. - I, uh, didn't tell you aboutthe bar association dinner. - We're still going, aren't we?- Oh, yeah. Yeah, but, uh, what I wanted to say was that they lost theirspeaker and I suggested Josef. - To speak? - Sure, sure. Then I called Bill Elliott. You know Bill. He runs a radio station. He might broadcast the speech. - You think that's a good idea? - Hm? - I mean, you getting involved like that. - Oh, I'm not involved. I just thought it wouldbe a good chance for Josef to be heard. - Excuse me, but can I say one more thing? - I'm 13 years old, and Ithink I should have something to say about my life. - I agree, Daniel. But it's because you're only13 that your mother and I have to approve that application. - But how am I supposed to become a man when I'm raised by girls' rules? I should start wearing a dress to school. - I have the perfect one for you. You'd look wonderful. [chuckles] - Oh, sure. Everyone laugh. - Oh, come on now, Daniel.- May I be excused? - I guess you're going to have to talk to him. - Oh, I will. [chuckles] - Where's Daniel? - He's pouting. [paper crumpling] - Daniel, what are you doing? I brought you desert. - I don't want it. Now, go on, and close the door. I told you to go on. - You're going to get into trouble, Daniel. - I already am in trouble. - Not like you're going to beif you sign mother and father's name to that application. - I've been challenged,Sarah, in front of everybody. Either I fight Freddy Landauer or I run away. - Freddy Landauer?! Daniel, he'll kill you! - Oh, thanks a lot, Sarah. That's just what I needed to hear. You're lucky, Sarah. It's easier being a girl. - Only sometimes. Mostly, it's just different. Lots of times, I wish I was you. - Yeah? Well, right now be glad you're not. [paper rustling] What are you doing? - Mother doesn't write like that. She writes pretty, like this. [cars revving] - In England, the Prime Ministerspeaks of peace in our time. And here in America, the mostpowerful, and elegant voice remains strangely silent. Why has not President Roosevelttold America and the world what he must surely know? Why has he not warned AdolfHitler to stop or else? You may not wish to hear this, [woman laughing] but what is happening in Germanycan happen here tomorrow. [crickets] [dog barking] [glass crashing] - Sarah? - Check the kids! - Daniel? [dramatic music] - Did you see anybody, Josef? - No, no one. They're cowards. They run away. - Be careful, there's glass over there. [interposing voices] - Ed, what happened? - It's all right, Millie. - Oh God, look at the window.- It's all right. - Where are they? Sarah, don't go far. - Thank you. I think Josef stirred up garbage. - Those things on the wall... Isn't that like what you told me about? You know, with the Truman Club? [shushes] - Quiet, now. Just forget everything I told you, OK? [whimsical music] - Hey, it's Daniel's house. - There's the cops. They busted up the whole thing. - Windows. - Good morning, officer. [interposing voices] - Hey, remember when we saw them? - I do. I wish I didn't. Boy. - They destroyed the whole place. [whistles] I wonder who did that? - How should I know? Come on, let's go. - Daniel, you know wherewe saw the Swastika before. - Yeah. Hey, didn't you tell your old man? - What are you guys, crazy? You want me to tell him where we went, and that we bet on the fight? You want me to tell him that? [boys agree] And anyway, who says it was them? Maybe it was somebody else.- That's true. - Yeah. Could have been. Could have been a German spy. - Maybe we should get a G-Man? - Yeah, that's a good idea. - Morning, Ed. - Morning, Sam. I got your message. I guess it must be important.- I think it is. Tom will be along in a few minutes. Ed, we do business all over Europe, and Germany is one of our biggest markets. - And this Kaplan fellow is speaking out against the bonafide government in Germany. - With good reason, wouldn't you say, Tom? - Oh, Ed, we're not politicians. We're business men. - And unfortunately you've been singled out as Kaplan's sponsor, and this reflects adversely on the company. - I'm no one's sponsor. - You know, Ed. Sam didn't want me to bring this up, but we had to fight like hell to get the board to approve your appointment. - Oh? - Well, [chuckles nervously] you know the board, Ed. Everybody acts as though theycame over on the Mayflower. - And there were no Jews aboardthe Mayflower, is that it? - Ed, you're the first Jewish executive in the history of this company. Now, that's a milestone, a breakthrough, and I don't want to seeyou do anything to ruin it for you or your family. - Oh, hell, Ed. We know why you're standingup for this fellow. [chuckles]I even admire you for it, but-- - Wait. Wait just a minute. You think I'm helping JosefKaplan because he's a Jew? - Well, aren't you? - No. No, I'm not. I'd help Josef Kaplan no matter what he was. I... Look, maybe you don't understand what's happening in Germany today. There are thousands ofinnocent people, not just Jews. Th-- they're being dragged out of their homes, packed into cattle cars, andsent God only knows where. They're never heard from again. I'm not helping JosefKaplan because he's a Jew. I'm helping him because he's a man and he's trying to fightthis thing all by himself. - All right, let's start over again. Maybe what you say is true. I don't know. But what you're doing is bad for business. - Sam-- - Let me finish. Whatever is going on overthere, is it really our problem? Oh, Ed, you know how Tom and I feel about you. It's just a matter of time. A spot on the board, stock options, bonuses, the whole ball of wax. Isn't that right, Tom? [chuckles] - Sure. - Ed, do all of us a favor, think about it. - All right, Sam, I'll think about it. Well, I never thought I'd seethe day when I'd complained about you two being too quiet.Why the long faces? - You feeling all right? - I'm not sick. - Something is bothering you, isn't it? - June Reilly can't be inthe Merry Makers anymore. - Oh, why not? - Because I'm a Jew. - Did she tell you that, sweetheart? - Aw, so what? I get that kind of stuff all the time from guys like Freddy Landauer. - But June is my best friend. - I know, sweetheart, andI'm sure that you'll be back playing together real soon. People like Frank Reillyought to be horsewhipped. I'm sorry, Ed. I just haven't any patience with parents who poison their children. - Do I have to be a Jew? - Do you have to have brown eyes? - I was born with them. - And you were born a Jew. You know, being Jewish is a partof you, Sarah, like your hair or your eyes, your wonderful personality. You're very special, Sarah. God only made one like you. [doorbell rings] - I'll get it. - It's probably Mr. Haley. Tell him I'll be right down.- I'll walk you down. Edward, you have to do something about this. It is one thing when it happens to me, but when it happens to our children, to innocent little Sarah,that is something else. - Wait a minute, wait a minute.What happened to you? What are you talking about? - I had a wonderful experience today with the lovely Grace Brumby. Millie, she says, Willis andI are having second thoughts about that Jewish man. [sighs] - Well, that makes it unanimous. Sam Wiggin... It seems Josef is bad for business. They don't want me involved.[scoffs] - No, did they say that? - Oh, yes. Yes, they said that. - Oh, Ed, we can't lose this opportunity. It means too much to us. - I know, I know, Millie. If I backed out now, I'm not sure that I could look myself in the mirror. Come on. Hey, hey. - I'm scared. I can't help it, Ed. I've lived in this town all my life, and now... I don't know. Everything is different all of a sudden. What's happening? Why do I feel like an outsider? - Come on. Come on now, darling. Look-- look, you just, um, we'll talk about this when I get home, OK? I love you. Give me a kiss. [kisses] [singing in hebrew] With pride and a great pleasure,I will now introduce to you a man of letters. A man, a scholar. A man who transcribed thehistory of the humans. There's no other than Josef Kaplan. - I am honored to be here tonight. I am honored to speak in your synagogue. [tires screech] - Form up! Form up! - I have escaped to tell thestory to the people of America. You, who represent our last hope. Here in this land of freedom, here-- [rioting outside] [yelling and rioting] [smash] All right, let's go. They got the message. [dramatic music] - The point is that this was an organized attack. - I understand that, Mr. Cooper. How many of them were there? - I don't know. I-- I'd say maybe-- maybe 30. - All right, did either of you two gentlemen recognize anybody either? - Look, Lieutenant, I toldyou that they wore hoods. - Mr. Cooper, withoutsome kind of positive ID, there's nothing I can do. And what do you want me to do, arrest everybody in town who doesn't like Jews? - That would be quite a task, wouldn't it? - Look, Mr. Cooper, I don't like this either for a lot of reasons, maybesome of them same as yours. I'm share of the Irish, and I grew up in Boston. I know the feeling. Mick, kike, wop. All swallow just as hard. [music playing] - Millie-- - Oh my God, Ed. - It looks a lot worse than it is. - But it's all down your face. - Honey, it is up in the scalp, and-- - What has happened? - Millie, I'm going topour this glass of brandy and I'm going to drink it. - Oh, Ed. - And then we'll talk, OK? You want some? - OK. Oh. - It's all right, it's all right. - And you don't know who they were? - I know what they were but I don't know who. - Sarah, Daniel, you are supposed to be in bed. - Father, we heard you come in, and-- - Yes? - And I know who they are. - All right, you wait here. Come in. - Look, Lieutenant, I know he was one of them. He runs the German Bund. Who else would attack asynagogue, paint swastikas? - He's got 20 witnesses who will swear he never left that club tonight. Now, you're a lawyer, Mr. Cooper... - So that's it? We let him walk out of here free as a bird? - We'll keep him and hisbunch under surveillance. That's all I can do. OK, Landauer, he can go. I'm sorry, Mr. Cooper. - Ed Cooper, huh? You the same Cooper who's gota boy over in Maplewood school? - Yes, I have a son in Maplewood. - You know what's going tohappen to that kid of yours when he gets in the ring with mine? You better start praying, Cooper. Well, that's what you peopleare good at it, isn't it? Praying? Not fighting. - How's your head? - Oh, it's-- it's all right. [sighs] - Ed. [liquid pouring] We're going to have totalk about this, you know. It's going to be all over the papers. - I don't care about the papers! I know what the papers are going to say. I know what Wiggins and Wade are going to say. Oh, Millie. I'll tell you something, Millie. I cannot get that mandownstairs out of my head. - Ed, I didn't mean that you shouldn't fight. - I know, I know, I know. He has to go. He has to go. I can't kid myself any longer. You and the children come first. It's just too dangerousnow, and this is America. What time is it? - Six. - Well, I'll let Josephsleep a little while longer. Don't hit my elbow. - Duane's here. He says he wants to talk to you. - Tell him I'll be down in about five minutes. - We're going to have totell him to leave, aren't we? - I'm afraid so. - I don't know what's going to happen to him. He's here illegally, Ed. - He entered this country illegally? Duane, why didn't you tell me that? He's in trouble with immigration. - I know I should have told you before. I kept meaning to. I-- I was wrong. I'm sorry, Ed. - I mean, he can bedeported back to Germany. He hasn't exactly been inconspicuous, you know. - I know. - If he goes back, what will they do to him? - They'll hurt Josef, won't they, Duane? - No, sweetheart. They won't hurt him. - Will somebody please tell me how I'm supposed to ask Josef Kaplan to leave? - Mr. Kaplan is here. - Josef. - Hello. Please, please, do not get up. I, uh, I have come to say goodbye. You have been very kind to me. You've taken risks on my behalf. Well, in Europe, whenyou read about Americans, it is about the Minutemen, the pioneer, the cowboy. Your courage comes from a very long tradition. Thank you seems so little tosay, but, uh, it is all I know. - Josef, what are you going to do? - What I came here to do. I will continue to speak out andtalk to any that will listen. When the world is right again, perhaps you will come visit me, hm? Ah, Daniel. He has such heart, and so full of the devil. I expect to hear great things of you one day. - I'll walk you to the bus, Josef. - What about immigration? - They know. - I, uh, will do what I can. Don't worry, I can fight if I must. - Josef? You said you'd know how to fight. Well, if you want to fight, you're going to need a good lawyer. I happen to be married tothe best fighting lawyer in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Well, really, Ed? What would you expect him to fight alone? - The first thing we're going to do-- listen. Listen, Josef. The first thing we're going to do is go to immigration before they come to us, and get started on keepingyou in this country. - Think you can do it, Ed? - I don't know, but we'vegot to buy some time. What do you say, Josef? - I-- I do not know what to say. - Just say yes, Josef. [chuckling] - Yeah. - Clementine. - Sit down. - Bring another cup of coffee. - Father and Josef did go to immigration, and much to everyone'srelief, it was good news. They said it would take a little time but they thought it could beworked out for Josef to stay. But father still had his problems. - It's Mr. Cooper, sir. - Ed, I was going to call you.- I know, Sam. I thought I'd save you the trouble. - Have you seen the paper? - No, but I can guess. - The front page! It's all over the front page. - Must be a slow news day. - Is that your idea of a joke? You've got a damn queer sense of humor. Tom and I have bent over backwards for you. I thought we had an understanding. - No, Sam, you and Tom had the understanding. - [ON PHONE]: Just what am I going to tell the board of directors? - Tell them I resigned. - [ON PHONE]: You what? - Look, Sam, I appreciateeverything you've done, I really do. I'm sorry it didn't workout, but you and Tom left me with a choice and I've made it. Guess I'll always wonder why it took me so long. [hangs up] We'll have to wait a whilefor the house at the beach. - Those things are morefun to dream about anyway. [bell dings] - This is where we're goingto hold the matches, boys. A lot of great champions have trained here. [rustling and thumping] - Hi, Dad. - Hi. How you doing? I wanted to talk to you about this this morning but I had a lot of other things on my mind. Sit down. [pats bed] I was, uh, wondering if youwanted to tell me anything. - What do you mean? Like what? You know, don't you? Did Sarah tell you? - Has Sarah ever told on you? No, it was Mr. Landauer. It seems he's looking forward to it. - I don't want to fight Freddy Landauer, Dad. He's going to kill me,but I've got to fight him. I just got to! If I can hit him with one, just one, then I don't care what he does to me. Dad, I know what I didwas wrong, and I'm sorry. I really am, but I'm notsorry about why I did it. - I'm not exactly Joe Louis,but in my time, when I had to, I can handle myself pretty good. Hey, do me a favor, don't look so surprised. I wasn't always this old. Maybe I can give you a couple of pointers. - You could? Oh, Dad, do I need help! But what about Mom? - Your mother is going to raiseCain, but she'll come around. - You aren't mad at me? - Daniel, I wish this world werechock full of boys like you. Been a long time since I did this, Daniel. All right, let's take it real easy now. Just keep your hands up like this. We'll just get the timing first.Across, you see? You don't have to do it hard. Just do it slowly first so you get the timing. OK, you try it. - Father was right. Mother did come around. Of course, it took a little persuading. And so my training began with father and Duane helping me as best they could.- OK. Wait a minute. Keep that left up becauseif Freddy would come across with a right, you'd block with your left, you see, and come in with a right cross. Now, come on, just try to get me. Just spar around a little. Oh, wait-- wait a minute. - The fight was only two weeks away and I was wishing it was two years. Or never. I remember wondering if JoeLouis ever felt that way. I figured he never did. - Perhaps, sir, if I'd mightjust make one small suggestion. - Sure. - Uh, I think, perhaps, you go a little fast. First was feet. Keep your legs bent... - Imagine our surprise when we learned that Josef had been quitean amateur boxer in Germany, good enough to win the silver medal in the 1924 Olympic games. Somehow, knowing that made me feel a little better because believe me, I needed all the help I could get. - That's good. Excellent! [lively music] - The fight was now only a few days away. I guess I had never worked sohard at anything in my life. Maybe I wasn't the better boxer, but I sure was a champion rope jumper. - That's good, Daniel. Now, cross your hands. That's good. [kids yelling] [clapping] [inaudible] [hitting] - And then it was the day before the fight, and every time I thought aboutit, I still got butterflies. And in my mind, FreddyLandauer got bigger and tougher every day, but I felt bigger and tougher, too. [cheers] [applause] - Ed, there's a telephone call for you. It's important. [clicks] - Ed? - Immigration is comingfor Josef in the morning. - I thought they saidthey could work that out? - It's a whole new ballgame now, Millie. He's no longer just any illegal alien. The German government has filed charges. High crimes against the state. - What does that mean? What can they do to him? - He's being extradited. The Brenneman sails forGermany tomorrow at 5:00. They want Josef aboard. - Oh my God. What can we do? What can we do? - As an officer of the court, they are holding me personally responsible for his whereabouts. - That poor man. Ed, we have to do something. What can we do? - He can't get on that boat, Millie. I'm going to tell him to leave tonight. - No, Edward, I cannot do that. Not to you. I will go back. - Josef, you can't do that. - No, my mind is made up. If I must, I will go back. I cannot harm the peoplewho have helped me so much. - Oh, Josef, there's a pot of fresh coffee. - Uh, no thank you, Francis. [clears throat] - I don't know what else to do. I've called everyoneincluding the Attorney General and the Lieutenant Governor. If I knew how, I'd callFranklin Roosevelt himself. - Excuse us, Josef. We have to go outside for a while. - Um, yeah, we got to go. - Sarah, don't go far. - All right, Sarah, what is it? - Do you know who's comingto Bridgeport today? Who's going to be giving aspeech at the railroad station? - No, who? - Oh, Daniel, don't you know anything? President Roosevelt! - And so, my friends, let mesay that as we here at home move out of the shadows of depression and hunger and into the warm light of a new age, we must remember one thing:despair is self defeating. We do not recognize despair in this country. We must go forward. - How are we going to get past them? - Or as the good booksays, where there is no-- - Wait here. - -- vision, the people perish. [clapping] And so, my good friendsand people of Bridgeport, I want you to remember uswhen you go to the polls. And even if you don't vote for us, I do want you to cast your vote because that's what this country is all about. [applause] [presidential music] - And that's why he can't go back. He just can't! Father, he's a lawyer. He called everyone heknew to try to help Josef, only he doesn't know you, of course, but you can help him, sir,being the whole President and everything. - Sarah, child, even thePresident must go by the rules. Now, if Mr. Kaplan hascome to America illegally, he has broken the law. And now, as you say, the Germangovernment wants him back. Well, I'm afraid my hands are just as tied as all those otherfellows your daddy called. - [CRYING]: But don't you see? If they take Josef away,we'll never see him again. They'll kill him! I know they will! - Oh, Sarah, Sarah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I truly am. Sarah. - Come on, Sarah. I told you it wouldn't work. Thank you anyway, Mr. President. - Ed, where on Earth could the children be? - Thank you, Ed. - I'm sorry, Josef. - I know. You say goodbye to the children for me. And tonight, remember, tellDaniel to keep up his right. Now, now, Francis. Who knows? One day you may look out the window and there I will be, smiling back at you. [crying softly] - I'm sorry, folks, butwe've got a boat to catch. - [WHISPERING]: Good luck. - We have made a beginning. Do not let it end here. [mournful music] - That night was the fight, andI still wanted to whip Freddy, but with Josef gone, somehow itjust wasn't the same anymore. [fight bell dings] - OK, boys. - Come on, Dan. - Yeah, come on! - OK, you're scheduled forthree two-minute rounds. So let's watch the lowblows, the kidney punches, and rabbit punches. In case of a knockdown, yougo to the corner I tell you to and you stay there until I tell you to come out. You understand? OK, go back to the cornerand wait for the bell. - Remember what we talked about. Keep moving, and at first, keepthat jab right in his face. OK? Just keep moving. [fight bell dings] - Get him, Daniel! [cheering] [punching] [crowd grows louder] - Atta-boy, son! Now hit him. That's it, son. [whistle] - Right and left, right and left. [cheering] Three, four. [thump] - Three, four, five, six. - Keep it up. Keep moving to your left. [whup] - Come on, Daniel, hit him! [fight bell dings] - Come here, come here. Let me see your eyes. Look at me. You all right? - Dig into the left. Dig in with the left, and you got it. - Uh-huh. - I want him down and out this time. - He won't get past this round. - All right. [bell dings] - Keep circling, and keepthat jab at his face. Jab, jab, jab! - I'm going to chop you up now, Cooper. [fighting] [cheering] - Three, four, five. - Daniel, move away. Move away! Come on, Daniel. Keep your hands up. [yelling] Come on! [bell dings] - Oh. - You OK, kid? - I'll say one thing for him,Pa, he can take a licking. - I don't care about that! I want you to take him downfor the 10 count this time, do you understand me, boy? - Yes, yes, all right. - Daniel, you don't have to go back in there. - I'm not going to quit now. It's the last round. - There's no need to quit. - Josef! - I have been watching. When he comes with the right,he comes much too wide. You must step inside. Block, and counter with an uppercut. Then you have it, you see. You keep moving. You're doing very well. - OK? - OK. - It's OK. It's OK. - Oh, I'm going to be sick.It's all right. - He's got a bloody nose. It's OK. - Look, mother, it's Josef! - Josef! [bell rings] [fighting] [wump] [cheering] - Three, four, five, six. [crowd grows restless] - Stay down, Daniel. - Two, three, four. [thump] - Circle, circle. [crowd clamouring] - Take him down, take him down. [cheering] [whup] [excited cheering] - Three, four, five, six, seven. He's out. [bell dings] [cheering and applause] - You let a Jew boy beat you! - Shut up! Just shut up and leave me alone. [applause continues] - You whipped me fair and square, Cooper. Put her there. - I'd sure hate to have to fight you again. - I was as happy that night asa fella could ever expect to be. I won the fight but what Iremember like it was yesterday is the feeling that ran throughme when I heard Josef's voice, and none of us will everforget what happened next. Father had a little victory party in the backyard and everyone was there,even Sarah's friend, little June Riley. And of course, it was doublyspecial because Josef was back, but no one seemed quite clear as to how that particular miracle had occurred, not until the telephone call. Father told us how he had just gotten a call from President FranklinDelano Roosevelt himself, and how it was the President who had intervened on Josef's behalf. I don't have to tell you how ourfamily voted from that day on. He even invited Sarah and me tovisit him in the White House. But the war came, andthings changed, and we never did see the President again. After the war, Josef Kaplan'schildren were able to join him, and he became an American citizen. He always said that it wasthe proudest day of his life. [music playing]
