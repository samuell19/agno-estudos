(bright music) (gong banging) (trumpeting music) (lively orchestral music) (relaxed orchestral music) (upbeat orchestral music) (chairs squeaking) Evening, Tom. Evening, Danny. Kid Curtis tonight, eh? The great comeback. How you gonna get him into the ring? He'll be there. Last week we could've put him on skates. Ever see him when he was good? See him? I was in his corner right there when he won the area championship. And I saw him win the British and Empire title at Harringay. The Culross fight, got me up there for luck, he said. What's he wanna come back for? They never make it. Once a champ, always a champ. Evening, Danny, here's the list of runners. Thanks, any news yet, Al? Last night, boy, that makes eight. How do you feel? A bit tired. I'm not surprised. [Man Over Speaker] One, two, three, four, testing. ("Yankee Doodle Dandy") [Flo] Hello, Danny. Hello, Flo, what about it? ("Yankee Doodle Dandy") [Man] Okay Harry, save it. Evening, Frank. [Frank] Hello, Danny. Come on, who do you think you are, Dennis Compton? Ah, don't come the old acid just because I've got my self-respect. [Danny] You've got too much, it warrants cutting. Now get busy. Okay, okay, who have we got in this dressing room tonight beside Kid Curtis? Well let's see, the first one on is Whitey Johnson. Not Whitey, I thought he was dead. Whitey'll never die. There's Rowdie Rawlings, Happy Burns, now there's an up-and-coming boy. Rick Martell, and a novice, a Welsh boy, first time in. Oh dear, oh dear. Well, I suppose they gotta start somewhere. I don't know why it always has to be in my dressing room. (door squeaking) [Man] Is Alf there? Is Alf up there? Hello, lookin' for somebody? I'm fighting here tonight. Yeah, which corner? Number two, I, I think. Well first door down on your left. I'll be seeing ya. Thanks. You blokes got my gear ready yet? It'll be ready when you need it. He'll need it, all right. We've got a novice in tonight. Oh no, I only got last week's blood off yesterday. Oh (chuckling), it's all yours son. Hi, I-I-I'm Lloyd, Eddie Lloyd. Pleased to meet you, make yourself at home. There's the lockers, take your pick. First in, best dressed. First out, best dressed. Keep your eye on your clothes, chump. They've got you fighting second tonight with Ern DeGrazos. Who got that fight for you? Oh, it was Mr. Warren. He said if I did well he might take me on. Good boy, DeGrazos, savage puncher. That's right, that's right, cheer him up. I'm just telling him the truth, that's all. DeGrazos happens to be good, that's all. With a left hand like a kick from a mule, that's all. Well, well, I reckon my left hand's not too bad. "Deadly," they say about DeGrazos, deadly with that left hand. Now, turn it up. You'll have him scared stiff before he gets in the ring. Evening, has Happy Burns shown up yet? Not yet, Mr. Lewis. When he comes in, tell him I'll be across in the pub and I'll see him later. Righto. the boy is up and coming. (car horn honking) (brakes squealing) I told you to come by train. But Lou, you can't run out of petrol on a train. Now if I'd known you were travelling with my favourite woman. Hello, Happy. (laughing) Come on girls, I'll buy you a drink before I clock on. No, you go on in Happy, I'll take care of the debutantes. That's it son, get 'em ready for presentation. (Happy whistling) - Oh, isn't he fresh? He's not as fresh as I'd like him to be. Come on. (ladies giggling) (Happy whistling) - Evening, Happy. Evening, Colonel. - Watcher, Happy. - Watcher, my son. Hey Happy, just a minute, mate. My kid wants you to sign his book for him. Here you are. I'll make me mark. Ah, come off it, Happy. You oughta treasure that, son. What's the other cross for? My manager, he can't write either. Hiya, Happy, how're the girlfriends? Ah, they're just crazy about me. I've gotta knock 'em back now with a thick stick. - Get away. - It's true, I'm thinkin' of puttin' an extra man on. (Joe laughing) All right, let the revels commence, I'm here. Well you can ruddy well go away again and let us have a bit of peace. Hello, Happy, how are you son? [Frank] Hello, Happy. Oh, my two favourite people! What've you been doing with yourself? What's the matter, son, don't you read the papers, eh? 17 fights in six months, that's all. 17 fights, Danny, and look at me, would you guess it? Look at that nose, son, straight as a die, not a dent in it. Not a little teeny, weeny mark. 17 fights in six months and not a mark on my beautiful kisser. Oh, blimey, I'm beautiful, you know, I'm beautiful. 17, that's too many fights, boy. I know a bloke who got double vision from working like that. You must be rolling in money. Oh, I've got too much. I'm giving it away to the poor people. Here, cocko, go careful with that, it's paid for. Happy Burns, how are you, son? Oh, E-E-Eddie Lloyd, pleased to meet you. Look at that nose, son, will ya? Look at that nose, straight as a die, not a dent in it. Oh, no wonder the women claw each other to death just to be near me. Uh, when do I change, sir? Now, in case Whitey's late. Oh, I see Rick Martell's on the bill. Yeah, he's making a fortune. What, him? The best horizontal heavyweight in the business? Yes, he sells the soles of his boots for advertising space. (Happy chuckling) [Man] All around papers. Papers! Extras. Evening papers, extra papers. Just buy a paper. Uh, see you in there in a minute, Rick. I gotta meet some fellas first. See ya, Frankie. [Man] Get your paper. Paper, paper. He'll go in the fourth. Tell the boys to help to themselves, and get me a price. Paper, paper. (crowd chattering) (bold orchestral music) You're gonna win tonight, Rick, I know you are. Uh now listen, Frankie, why don't you wait for me somewhere. I'm gonna watch you are you're gonna win, I know you are. I've got a feeling tonight's the night. You've had enough bad luck, haven't you, Rick? Yes, yes, I suppose I have. Like your last fight, everyone thought you was winning until you got that unlucky one. Yes. A man sitting next to me lost five pounds on you. He was ever so surprised. You should've heard what he said about you. I was that mad, I turned right round him and said, "If my Rick heard you say that about him, "he'd knock your teeth right in the back of your throat." (chuckling) He soon shut up, I can tell you. Thanks. You know a boxer can't win every time. Darling, I can't hardly bear it when you lose. It doesn't seem right, somehow. Tonight, you've got to win. Like this. Uh, you got me. (upbeat orchestral music) I'll see ya after the fight. Yeah, does anybody know anything about this Watson bloke I'm suppose to be fighting tonight? Yes, I do. All right, let me tell him. Got a wicked right hand, they say. Ex-marine, commando, a terrible right hand. Oh, come off it, Danny. That's the truth, Happy, right hand like a stick of dynamite, plain dynamite. Shut up, will ya. I'm not kidding, Happy, it's the truth. See, so you better keep your nose out of the way, Happy. If he flattens that, you'll be losing all your girlfriends. Well I'll still have me charm and culture, won't I? (Happy whistling) (Happy laughing) Hey, look who's here. Don't tell me you've still got your licence. You talk too much. Hello, Rick. - Hi, Danny. - Hi, Rick. Now come on, Eddie, what'd you do, fall in? I want to bandage you. Bandage? Yes, your hands before you fight, and the rest of you afterwards. Oh, you're new, eh? Oh yes sir, I've been fighting as a amateur. What'd you turn pro for? Oh, I don't know, I thought I'd have a bash, and the money's good. So's the bash. All you amateurs come into the pro game thinking it's gonna be easy. You should know. What's eating him? What a programme, eh? Kids and has-beens. Which are you? How's any manager got Kid Curtis top of the bill? He still draws the crowd. Especially in this town, he married a local girl. Yeah, and he's still a has-been. That's better than a never-will-be. I'm a never was. 15 years in the ring and I end up nursemaiding you blokes. Now hold still Eddie while I fix your nappy. Well, if ever you hear about me trying to go on when I'm past it, you can take me outside and shoot me. Why wait? [Happy] I'll come up there and clout you. Come on Rowdie, come on, you're late. Watcher, Rowdie boy. That's a nice haircut. Eh? Yattitee, yattitee, yattitee, he'll get lockjaw the way he keeps on talkin', I'm not kiddin'. Where's Whitey, doesn't he know he's on first? Whitey again. What is this, old favourites night? Don't you worry, mate, you'll see, you'll see. Snap into it, Whitey, you're on first. First? What do they mean, pushing me around, eh? I'm no mug. First, you wait till I see Mr. Adams, I'll give him first. (paper scratching) (blowing) (crowd chattering) (lively orchestral music) (Whitey speaking muffled by crowd noise) Just you wait till I see him. Who does he think he is, putting me on first? Johnson, you're late. Yeah, Mr. Adams. You want this fight, or don't ya? Get moving, you're on first. Yeah, that's right, Mr. Adams, first. Boy, you told him. - Ah! - And how. (crowd chattering) (upbeat orchestral music) Don't sit around, Eddie, you'll get cold. Start warming up, son. Hey, Whitey, where have you been? Nevermind where I've been, first, first, first, they're always putting me in first. I'm no prelim fighter, these geezers oughta know that. The mugs oughta be first. Here, I told old Adams, see, I just told him. Did you frighten him? Oh, I'm no mug start, man, I was fighting features afore you was born. Before who was born, old Moore? Yeah, listen you... Now come on, Whitey, cut it out son, stop wasting time, we're late enough already. Yeah, I'll give 'em first. Yes, you give 'em first. Hey, you scared? No, no, I'm, I'm just a bit nervous, like, I want to put up a good show. I got my mom and dad out there, see. Don't worry, son, it's the same for all of us. Don't tell me you've got a mom and dad. Get out of it. Ah, you see, it's always been a bit of sport before. Sport? You'll learn. Don't mind him, son, he's taken more dives than Esther Williams. Where's my boy, Martell? He's in there, Mr. Warren. Oh, Mr. Warren... Later, son, later. Well the money's on for the fourth. And remember to make it look better than you did last month. I didn't wanna do it then, and I don't wanna do it now. Listen, when you wanted the money bad I worked it for you. If it hadn't been for me, you'd be inside. I don't care. This is the last time. Rick, we're in too deep. There's others making money outta you and they wanna go on. This is the last time, I'm telling you. And who's been telling you, that skirt of yours? Cut it out! What good do you think she's gonna do ya? She's proud of me, she thinks I'm wonderful, see. You? Come off it, I can guess the sort she is. What, you keep your dirty mouth off her. We're gonna get married, see. C-c-congratulations, Rick. I didn't mean anything, honest, I didn't. Then don't say it, that's all. (door clattering) (whistling) Excuse me. Uh, righto Rick, see you in your corner. Keep warm now. Well why don't you stay with him, you're reckoned to be pretty hot. Ah. (Happy gurgling) Oh, I'm here, Mr. Warren. Who are you? Eddie Lloyd, remember, you saw me at the gym. Yeah, look, I'm busy just now. Oh well, I just thought I'd... Later son, later, see how you go, eh? First, first, first, they're always putting me on first. I know more than all of 'em put together. I've won more fights than this lot's had hot dinners. Now come on Whitey, give us your hands. - First, first, I'll show 'em, mate, I'll come back. They're lettin' Jim Curtis come back, aren't they? They're featuring him, ain't they? Well why won't they give me a chance, hey? (car engines rumbling) (bells tolling) (door bell jingling) What have you come for? To see my wife. Haven't you done her enough harm? What do you mean harm, it wasn't me who left her. No, and how long before you noticed she'd gone? Just let me see Peg, will ya? And where's all the money now? The great comeback. Please, Father. (door bell dinging) (man and woman laughing) Come in, Jim. Four teas and four cheese rolls, please. (woman laughing) (people chattering) Hello, Jim, I wondered if you'd come. Well I couldn't very well be fighting here and not look you up, could I? Well, sit down, Jim. Thanks. (train rumbling) Well, I've missed ya, Peg, all these years. You knew where I was. Yes but, I didn't wanna see ya until... Until what? Well, I was having a bad patch. But, I'm coming back, Peg, I, I've won three fights already. And lost two. Well I was robbed the last one. You've been following it, have you? Have you? What if I have? Why did you come, Jim? I suppose to, to see if there was anything left between you and me. [Peg] There isn't enough to make you chuck it, is there? Fighting's my job, Peg. And I'm on my way up again, and if you were back with me... I'll never come back while you're still in the ring. I told you that when you were champion and I'm telling you now. And I'm telling you I'll be in the money again. It'll be big money for both of us. I've told you Jim, that's not what I want. We were happy enough before you turned pro. You didn't like being broke anymore than I did. And what did the money ever do for us? I didn't leave you because you lost your money or your title. You had them both when we split up. I left you because you weren't my husband any longer. The crowds and the cheering spoiled you. And the other women. There was never any woman for me but you, Peg, and you know it. At least not until after you walked out on me. Anyway I've, I've learned my lesson now, it'll be different this time, you see. I'll, I'll save money, I'll be able to give you anything you want, Peg. All I want is for you to stop fighting. That's all I ever wanted. But I can't stop now, Peg, not now, I've got the chance to get back and I can do it too. You, you don't believe me, do ya? Well just you watch tonight, I can lick that Deakon with both hands tied. And after that, after that, Peg, you see there'll be no stopping me. That's right, Jim, no stopping you. Well if you don't believe me, come and watch me tonight. See for yourself. I can see all I want from here. Good luck, Jim, I know when I'm licked. So tell your boys to expect some good, clean fighting tonight. Clean fighting? Of course, Mr. Reynolds, naturally. The control board weren't too happy the way some of the decisions went last week. Neither was I, Mr. Reynolds, not a bit happy. Yes, we must try and be more cheerful in the future then, mustn't we? Yes, Mr. Reynolds. Come on. (crowd chattering) (upbeat orchestral music) Yeah, they've got no right to put me on first, man, I'm tellin' ya. Will you turn it up, Whitey, now change the record. Now listen boys, I want it good tonight and no funny business. The boxing board's here and they expect to see some nice, clean fighting. And that's what they're gonna see. Any questions, anybody here not seen a doctor? Okay, keep 'em moving, Danny. Good luck, boys. Now remember, no rough stuff out there tonight. Keep it nice and clean and we might get on television. He was lucky I kept my trap shut. After tonight I won't be no first in. I nearly told him. That's it Whitey boy, you tell him. Hey Rowdie, that must be some book you're reading there. Here, Danny, listen to this. "A magnetic impulse drew her irresistibly towards him. "His strong arms unfolded her in the darkness. "Through the thin nylon of her spacesuit, "she could feel the rhythmic throbbing of his heart. "He drew her close, closer and closer, "then suddenly, there was a sharp buzzing "on his Geiger counter." You see, she's radioactive at the time. I'll say she is. Who is? Cynthia, the Uranium Lady. Oh. You see. Atom Man's met Uranium Lady. What're you doing outta class, you just miss old Adams' pep talk. I don't seem to miss any of yours. You see me in a month's time, mate, I won't be doing any first in, I'll show 'em. That's right, the last of the bare knuckle boys. What's that? What did he say? Nothing, nothing. How old are you, Whitey, 33, 34? Uh, 34, I think. 34 and still in this racket, you must be barmy. Anything's a racket if you like to make it one. I don't know about you, but I went into boxing to make a living. Like a lot of other blokes before and since. All right, it's a hard way, we all know that. And we all know it's the people who talk about rackets that muck boxing about. The blokes that don't go into the ring, they're the ones that get rich outta boxing. Good evening, Kid, you're in number two. Thanks. It's Kid Curtis. Good luck to you, boy. (all talking at once) Going to lick this Barney Deakon tonight? Sure, and anyone else, you just watch me. - Good luck. - Good luck to you, boy. (men chattering) - Get lucky myself. [Kid] Good evening, Mr. Lewis. Hello, Kid. Didn't expect to see you here. Oh, I get around. Saw you at Darby last week, bad match. But I won it easy. Too easy. Bouts like that won't get you anywhere. I uh, I've got a bad manager. Heard you were managing yourself. That's just what I mean, now if you were handling me... Sorry Curtis, I've got my hands pretty full at the moment. Sure, sure I just thought maybe that you... [Eve] Did you order me one? I think you know my wife, Curtis. Your? Good evening, Mrs. Lewis. Hello, Kid. Your drink. Lou, um, go back to your pals, I want to talk to Kid. It's been a long time. You haven't changed much. I take care of my looks. Do I look that bad? No, not really. Almost like the man I used to know. The man you ran out on. That was the man who lost the championship. I mean the man who won it. And I'll win it again too. I wonder, Lou says you're too old. He could be wrong, couldn't he? He's a good manager, but he could be wrong. I wonder. I asked him to manage me just now. What did he say? Said he was too busy. I could talk him into it. Do it if I asked him. Why should you? Why do you think? (upbeat orchestral music) What about him? I can manage him, he'll manage you. If you win tonight. I'll win all right. I could be champion again with Lewis behind me. And me. Sorry, Eve, I've got other plans. Anyway, good luck, Kid. Thanks. Well, well, well. Just suppose he was good tonight. You could get him some money fights, couldn't you? What'd be the point? For me, I mean. (crowd chattering) Now please, now quiet. Your attention please. Before this evening's programme commences, introducing the Hon. Treasurer of the St. Mark's Boys' Club and Gymnasium, Mr. Coleman. (crowd cheering) Now please, now quiet now please. Collection boxes will be passed around during the opening bouts. Give freely and generously, I thank you, huh? Oh yes, and once the collection boxes are out, I will accept donations here and now, please. Please, your donations, please. One pound, Ashley. One pound from Mr. Ashley of Ashley's the high class family butcher. [Man] What, no offal? (crowd laughing) Now please. Two pounds, Bower. And two pounds from Mr. Bower of Bower's, the cycle stores of Queen's Road. (crowd chattering loudly) Now quiet, now please. Three pounds, Cardew, anonymous. And three pounds anonymous from Mr. Cardew of Cardew's Funeral Parlour. Any empty boxes? (laughing) (crowd chuckling) Now, please. (crowd chattering) Now, quiet. Vaseline, Danny? [Danny] Help yourself. Well, you reckon I won't win tonight, don't ya? I tell ya what, I bet I'll win before the sixth round. There you are, anything you like. Go on, go on, bet a quid. Here, here, a quid. It's a bet. There you are, see? Now you all heard him, didn't ya, hey? Yes, Whitey boy, we heard him. All right, here we go, number one, Whitey Johnson. That's me, mate. Good luck, Whitey. That's me. [Joe] They're waiting for ya. Ah, let 'em wait. Here now, y'all heard him, didn't ya, eh? Here, he bet me a quid I couldn't beat this geezer 'fore the sixth round. Come on, Whitey. (laughing) It's a quid, isn't it, eh? [Happy] Good luck, Whitey boy. Eh? Oh, ta, mate. Yeah, I'll show 'em, mate. - Come on. I'll show 'em. (crowd chattering) Got a good crowd in there for you tonight so give 'em a good show. Don't you worry. Kid. Hello, Kid, remember me? Whitey Johnson, we fought the same programme once, remember? Go on, get in there. Oh, yeah, sure, sure, how are ya? There y'all, he remembers, he remembers me. What did I tell ya, sendin' me in first, I... Get in there. - There ya are. - Come on, Whitey, will ya. Hey, wish me luck, mate, your old China. Come on. [M.C.] Gentlemen, when the collection boxes have been returned to the ring, the sum total... - Don't do that. [M.C.] Will be announced by Mr. Coleman. And now, the first bout of the evening. Gentlemen... Look at him, they're robbing the graveyards now. This won't take long, they can keep his place open. What'll you give me on Whitey? He'll lay ya five pound to one. Take it. But? You're all right. I hope ole Whitey does all right tonight. All I hope is that I'm not a burned out ring comic at 34 like him. That's Kid Curtis, he's no different. [Danny] Jim Curtis was a big name. [Rick] People don't come to see the big name fight, they come to see him getting beaten up. Hello, Danny. Hello, Jim, nice to see ya. (chuckling) Let's have a look at ya. [Happy] I'm Burns, Happy Burns. Ah, I've been reading about you in the papers, hi. Evening. I got ya fixed up in this room, Jim. It's good to see ya again. Well, how are ya, fit? Huh, never been fitter. Yet according to Peg, I'm licked before I get in there. You've seen her? Just now. Oh yeah, I see her quite often since she came back to the Caff. [Jim] Oh yeah? Yes, we have a bit of a natter about old times. Yeah, so did we. And a fat lotta good it did either of us. (telephone ringing) Well, I'll see ya later, Jim. Yeah. You uh, you fought Tom Culross, didn't ya? Yeah, that's right. Why, were you there? Oh no, I was too young. You took the title from him, didn't ya? Mm-hmm. My old man always talking about that fight, he saw it. I saw most of it through one eye. Ah, he still talks about it. Culross going down only 15 seconds before the final bell. Gee, that must've been a fight. It sure was. Oh, you must've felt terrific. Winning the title and that. How did it feel? I don't know how it felt. It was a week before I remembered my own name. (crowd yelling) (punches thudding) Kill him, kill him. Tear him to bits. Good, ain't it? (crowd chattering) (punches thudding) Please tell me Johnson passed the doctor. Yes, I think so. Better make quite sure, hadn't we? Yes, Mr. Reynolds. Which one? I don't know. Kill him. (crowd cheering) Somebody's getting it. [Rick] My quid's safe. How many rounds is Whitey suppose to be fighting? Six, Eddie, same as you. Oh well he, he oughta last out six rounds, didn't he? Not at his age, he won't. He's younger than I am, so you wanna make something of it? No, but you've been out of the game for some time, haven't you? Well now I'm back into the game, any objections? No. Here, here, a girl comes up to me the other day, she said, "Why ain't you got a broken nose? "I just adore men with broken noses." You see, there's no pleasing females of the opposite sex. I knew a woman who was crazy about blokes with no hair. Well the dame in this book's crazy over a man from Mars, 12 feet tall, with green hair on his chest, and a radioactive space gun. Well it says here, it says, "Then beneath the trembling, "ak-akakia," that he kissed her. Well, so what? Well, what I wanna know is, whereabouts is her akakia? Whereabouts is her what? Her akakia. Akakia, that's a tree, an acacia tree. Oh, it's a tree is it? Yes. Well I wasn't expecting that. Well not on Mars. Go back to your trance, Rowdie. H-how many rounds is Whitey suppose to be fighting? Six. We told ya before. Oh, oh yes, six, that's right. Sorry, I forgot. How many has he done? Oh four, four. (audience gasping) That's another two to go. Another eight minutes. Clever. (crowd cheering) What does that mean? It means the fight's over and I've won a quid. - One, two, - There you are, too strong you see, too strong. - Three. - I seen it coming. - Four. What did I tell ya? Huh? Eh, hey. Well get him another one, it's charity, ain't it? On the table with him, Frank. Take it easy, Whitey, take it easy. Well, what did they hit him with, a hammer? You should talk, he knocked Grendon out in the fourth round. Good ole Whitey. (laughing) You lose a quid. What, do you mean he won? Yeah. Good boy, Whitey, you said you'd do it, didn't ya? Good boy. Yeah, I hit him, mate, I hit him. A perfect right hook. Who see it, eh, anybody see it? Yeah, Whitey, I saw it. Oh, it must've took his blooming head off his shoulders, mate, must've lifted him right off his feet. It was dynamite, boy what a punch. It was perfect, mate, a righto, fourth round, wasn't it? Hey, I knew I'd get him, you know, I knew I would. Here, who bet me I wouldn't win, eh, who bet me? It was a quid. Come on you, who were ya? - Sit still, Whitey. [Whitey] Who was it, eh? Well why don't you pay up, Martell? It won't break me. [Whitey] Here, we can still show 'em, can't we kid, eh? Us old 'uns, eh? Yeah, we can show 'em, Whitey. Here ya are, Whitey, stay lucky. Yeah, I should've made it five, shouldn't I, eh? He, (chuckles) he never knew what hit him, mate. He was working on me eye, see, that was bleeding like a flaming fountain. But I let him work on it. I knew he'd leave himself out when he thought he had me, see. Here, so I steps to one side, so it gives him a short one, see. He comes forward, mate, so I brings a right across. He fell right in it. Look, I tell ya, it must've took his head right off his shoulders. Here, here, who seen it, eh? Any of ya see it, did ya? Yeah, this eye'll need a stitch. It don't need no stitch, mate. It's always being stitched, always busting open. Now sit still, will ya. Number two, Eddie Lloyd. Yeah, yeah, I'm here. Good luck, son. Well thanks. Hey, Eddie, you got anybody out there? Yeah, that's what I'm scared of. I don't wanna let him down, see. My old man's there too. He'll be proud of ya. Now look Eddie, don't worry. You just go out there and do the best you can. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. There's nothing else to it. [Joe] Come on, Eddie, let's go. Remember Eddie, chin down, hands up, and keep yourself outta trouble. Good luck, cock. Going for a breather, Danny, be just outside. Okay, Jim. Here, I bet I lifted him right off the floor, mate. And I was seeing so perfect, you know, none of that seeing fuzzy. Oh, I won't be fighting no more lousy prelims mate, I'm tellin' ya. Ooh, blimey, what you tryin' to do, kill me? (crowd applauding) [M.C.] Eddie Lloyd of Wales. [Timekeeper] Seconds out. (bell ringing) - Come on, Eddie, come on. - Come on, Eddie boy. Keep after him, keep after him. Don't you worry, Mother. That's it, go on Eddie boy. Get in there, Eddie boy. (crowd yelling) Well, what time do you think he'll go on? Can't tell, Peg. Might be 9:30, 9:45, depends on the others. Oh. Thank you. (crowd cheering distantly) Peg. Peg, uh... Jim, Jim, I didn't mean to, you know, say that to you. That I was licked? I didn't mind, 'cause I'm not. I don't ever want you to be licked. I won't be. Ah, come on, Peg. You don't understand, do you? I don't put it right. I never understood why you left me, if that's what you mean. I could've given you anything you wanted then, Peg. Money, diamonds even, if you'd wanted them. And I still can if you wait. On days like after you won the title, half crazy and blind and your jaw wired up. You think I want that again? Why not, if I can take it? Peg, listen to me. I only want one year, that's all. Just one year at the top then I'll get out for good, I promise. That's all I need, just one year. And if I win this fight tonight, I'll really be on my way back. So won't you come, Peg? I need you, you know. I always needed you, I always fought good when you were there. And I hated every single moment of every single fight. But I knew you wanted me there, I loved you. Every time you took a beating they were hitting me. I went on taking it as long as I could, but I can't anymore. If you win tonight you'll never give up. And that'll be the end of us forever. I hope you lose. Okay, if that's how you feel. It is, Jim. Well I won't lose, I'll win tonight and I'll go on winning till I get to the top again. You'll see. Oh, what a punch that was. I wish you'd seen that, Danny. Mate, I just wish you'd seen it. Yeah, I wish I'd seen it, Whitey. Yeah, that lifted him right off the floor, I reckon. You goin' out to celebrate now, Whitey? No, you ain't got no time for celebrating, mate, when you're making a fresh start. Well, if I bump into any of you blokes, don't be shy, will ya? Come up and talk to me, I'll speak to ya. That's big off you. (laughing) Good luck, Whitey boy. Yeah, I knew I could do it, mate. Hey Whitey, the boss wants to see you. There you are, see, what did I tell ya, eh? You wait till I see old Adams, mate, I won't be doing no more first ins. [Joe] Come on Whitey, he's waiting. Let him wait. [Happy] How's the boy doing out there, Joe? He's ahead on my scoring. DeGrazos is watching himself with the boxing board out there. Hey, is that true, Danny? You weren't here, the boss told us. There's three of 'em. One bloke does it, we all get a bad name. Yeah, they'll be taking saliva tests after each fight soon. What do you think they are, greyhounds? (crowd yelling) Hey Jack. Go down ringside and tell Jim Warren I've gotta see him right away. [Jack] Righto. I'll wait here. (crowd yelling) Come on, Eddie, come on. Lead with that left, give it to him. What do you think this is, chapel? (crowd yelling) (bell ringing) (crowd applauding) What's up? Listen, Jimmy, I'm not gonna do it, I can't. I told ya, didn't I, you got to. There's some blokes from the boxing board here. I'll lose my licence, so will you. Licence? Oh but they won't tumble if you make it look good. I tell ya, I'm gonna win tonight. But you can't, Rick. Listen, go out there and tell your pals I'm going in there to win. But the money's on now, Rick. I'm gonna win. (bell ringing) (crowd yelling) Frankie, there's trouble, trouble for Rick and you. What do you mean? You've gotta make him see sense. Keep up. Keep up. Come on, Eddie. Oh! Eddie, come on! Go on, and another, and another. (crowd chattering loudly) Go on. Pick it up. (punch thudding) (crowd gasping) [Man] Take him out. [Referee] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, box on. (crowd yelling) (punches thudding) Eddie. Eddie. No, oh. (crowd yelling) - Come on. - Come on, Eddie. Get back in it, get back. (crowd gasping) (woman screaming) [Referee] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, out. (crowd cheering) (crowd booing) [Man In Crowd] It's a carve up, it's a carve up. [Man In Crowd] Eddie! (crowd booing and cheering) Mark this one for report. DeGrazos and the referee. Ah, what did I tell ya? Dah, amateur. [M.C.] Gentlemen, please. (crowd booing) Ladies and gentlemen, as usual, all-in wrestling will take place on Wednesday next, with prices. Give me a hand with him, will you, Danny. Blimey, what hit him? - All right, all right. - All right, son, snap out of it, take it easy. (Eddie gasping) Number three, Rowdie Rawlings, ready? Ready. Don't any of you touch this book when I'm out. I don't wanna lose the place. 'cept you, Eddie. You can read if you want to, smashing story. Take your mind off things, you know. Come on, Rowdie. Good luck, Rowdie boy. What happened to you, Eddie? I was, it was going along all right. I reckon I was ahead on points. And, I had him down, and then I don't know what happened, the whole place exploded. I-I-I don't know what happened. Ah, it's happened to all of us, Eddie. He just caught you napping. It was like, my eye was filled with sand. I-I-I couldn't see a thing. He got off the floor with resin on his gloves. Caught the ref napping too. Aye, and he, he jammed his thumb into my eye and I, I couldn't see a thing and he cut me with the inside of his gloves. I, I did everything they told me to do. I did everything they said. You go to the washroom and have a good sluice down, Eddie. You'll feel better after that. It was just bad luck, that's all. I don't know. My family and all the blokes were there, see, and, I, I don't know what to do. Ah now, look Eddie, you do as Danny says. It was just bad luck for your first fight, that's all. Everybody knows what DeGrazos is. The dirtiest in the game. Let's hope the board nabs him. You go and have a good shower, son. DeGrazos. I'll give you a hand. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a heavyweight contest. Your attention please. Gentlemen and sportsmen all, one of the collection boxes has not been returned. (crowd laughing) Quiet please, now quiet. I'm offended. I say, let's have that box back now. We're all here to see fair play. (crowd laughing) What do you mean, where is she? Hey, just a minute. What're you doing matching Eddie Lloyd with DeGrazos? You don't think I'd have put him in if I didn't think it was right, do ya? Yes. I'm crying, I'm crying. You've got nothing to do with it. Rick, he said if you don't do it, they'll be waiting for me. I'm frightened Rick, who are they? I don't know, I've never seen them. He said they want you to lose in the fourth round. And he said... Shut up a minute and let me think. He said you've done it before. And I said he was lying. Warren wasn't lying. Rick. Now listen Frankie, where are you sitting? Rick, you've got to do something. He said they'd beat me up, he said they'd cut me. Now listen, just stay in your seat until it's all over. Sit tight, they daren't touch ya. What am I gonna tell him? He's waiting for me. Tell him, tell him it's all right. (crowd cheering) (crowd yelling) What's the matter, Martell? You look as if you... Shut up Burns, or I'll... Tellin' you, he don't like me. That don't seem possible, does it? What's the matter, Martell, you look sick. Leave me alone, will you? (crowd yelling distantly) Is it all right if I go now? You go whenever you like, Eddie. Hey, Eddie, come here. Look you uh, you don't wanna worry about tonight. You were unlucky, that's all. The game isn't full of dirty fighters like DeGrazos. It'll be different next time, you'll see. No, no there is not going to be any more. Ah, come off it, Eddie, we've all said that. What did you say after your first fight, Jim? I said I was gonna be world champion. I hadn't even won the fight. See, we all say silly things after the first fight. No, I mean it. I don't mind being beaten by anyone. I've been beaten plenty of times before. But I've been beaten fair. I always reckoned that fighting was the fairest game in the world. Not like tonight, it wasn't fair, that's all. It's happened to all of us, Eddie, you don't wanna worry. (crowd applauding) Better be going now. I just wanna say thanks, you know. Okay, Eddie, any time. - See ya. - See you here again soon. No, no you won't. You're a pro now, can't go back to amateurs, Eddie. Oh it's, it's different than what I thought it would be. All the blokes at the factory and my old man, they reckoned I'd win easy. Aye, and I would've done too, only it wasn't fair, that's all, it wasn't fair. Well how's that, the stiffness gone? Yeah, that's fine, thanks Danny. Okay Rick, let's get the tapes on. He was a funny kid, wasn't he? He took it bad. He was lucky to find out it was a racket as early as he did. No, he'd never have been any good. Why, useful little boxer. Yeah, boxer maybe, but he'd never make a fighter. A fighter's got to have killer in him. He's got to act and think like a killer. Only one thing that stops him being a killer, and that's these. Ah, sounds crazy to me. No, it's not so crazy. I remember reading in a book one time where they used to have fights way back in ancient Rome, just like we do now. They went in the ring with lumps of brass tied to their fists and they killed each other. Well, the boxing board would never stand for that. (crowd clapping) Well that's over, by the sound of it. Are you all right? Your hands are like ice. I'll be all right when I get in there. I knew a bloke who went into the ring all cold like you one night. What happened? Without a blow being struck, in the third round he dropped stone dead. [Happy] How'd you get on, Rowdie boy? Knocked him out in the third round. I was dead lucky. Good fight, he's a good kid. That was short and sweet, wasn't it? Well, he hit me. (Happy laughing) Okay, number four, Rick Martell. Ready. You sure you're all right? I'm fine, I tell ya. Well, good luck, son. Good luck. Good luck, Rick. Okay, Rowdie. Where's the Welsh boy? He's gone home. Ah, a shame, wasn't it? Before announcing the next contest, I have to appeal to you again. Somewhere in the aisles, a collection box has disappeared. Now, we're all gentlemen and sportsmen here. (crowd laughing) So let's have that box back. I thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a heavyweight contest of eight rounds, three minutes each round, between Joe Dunne of Dublin. (crowd applauding) And Rick Martell of Brixton. [Timekeeper] Seconds out. (bell ringing) Rick Martell, he looks in pretty good shape. Yeah, first rate. I'll have an even fiver on Joe Dunne. Okay, you're on. (crowd chattering) How long have you been seeing double, Johnson? What do you, what do you mean, seeing double? I see as good as you, mate, and better. Is that why you carry your head on one side? There's no need to get personal. I'm sorry, Whitey, I know you have to do it to try and get your eyes in line with each other. Don't you? Well, what if I do? You can't go on taking punishment. Who says I can't? Hey ya, you've seen me doctor's certificate, Mr. Adams. He passed me all right to start work again, didn't he, eh? Did you tell him what your work was? What's that gotta do with you, eh? I'm trying to help you, Johnson. - Ah, phew. - Now, listen to me. A man can take just so much. Every time you take a hard blow, your brain hits against your skull, then it gets bruised. And if you go on, one day even quite a light blow could kill you. That's why I'm going to recommend to the board that they take away your licence. You've gone on too long, you're too old, Johnson. (crowd cheering distantly) But I, I won me fight. I won it, I tell ya. No hard feelings, Whitey. It's not up to me, you know, you've had a long run. You, you can't do this. I won me fight, I won it. (crowd cheering) (crowd chattering) Come on, Rick, come on, you hit him! Come on. Kill him, knock him down. Finish him off, Martell, finish him off! Why don't you finish him off? (bell ringing) You're doin' fine, Rick. What do you think you're doing? You're killing him. Well, you told me to make it look good until the fourth, didn't you? Yeah, but watch your step, these boys mean business. And I bet the limit, ooh! (bell ringing) (crowd cheering) (crowd jeering and whistling) Blimey, something's gone wrong, listen to 'em. Quick, get these gloves off. What's the matter, what happened? Will you get these gloves off. Well what's the blood pressure up for, did you win? Dirty crook, he laid down on me. I hardly touched him. I just shoved a left in his face and he folded up like an old deck chair. You mean he laid down? Get this glove off, will ya? (Happy laughing) Anyone could see the fight was fixed. (Happy laughing boisterously) I don't know what was the matter with the ref. Should've got him on his feet and made him fight on. You should've had a rehearsal. (Danny and Happy laughing) Cut it out, will ya? Well what're you moanin' about, you won, didn't ya? (laughing) Keep this for me, Danny, I'll be back for it. I'm glad you won boy, surprise is the spice of life. [Rick] You keep your nose outta this. Not gonna change your shoes, what's all the rush for? Ah, intermission. Let's pour beer on the troubled waters. Coming over to the pub, Frank? Yes, keep it dark, Happy. [Happy] Yep. (bold orchestral music) Excuse me, miss. (person whistling) Thanks. (upbeat orchestral music) Where's she gone, where is she? (upbeat orchestral music) Frankie, Frankie! Rick, I'm here. (upbeat orchestral music) (crowd chattering) Rick! (upbeat orchestral music) (Frankie gasping) (Frankie screaming) (Frankie crying) It's all right, Frankie, it's all over now. Oh Rick, I had to run, I had to. I couldn't stay there. I know. All right, Frankie, they can't find us now, it's all right. We're getting outta this for good. (Frankie sobbing) Hello? [Fred] Stadium Caff. I want to speak to Peg. [Fred] Who is this? It's me, Jim. [Fred] Jim who? Jim Curtis, of course. [Fred] We don't want you here. Now wait a minute, all I wanna do is to speak to her. [Fred] Why? Well, I've got a right. [Fred] She doesn't want to. Oh yes she does. Look, will you please tell Peg I wanna speak to her. [Fred] She's gone out. Oh, well, well when she comes in, give her a message will ya? Tell her... [Fred] Well? Tell her I... [Fred] Tell her what? Oh, what's the use, forget it. (phone receiver clicking) (upbeat orchestral music) Wrong number? Yes, I think it is. Kid, you haven't changed your mind, have you? I think I'd like Lou Lewis for my manager. Good, but remember Jim, you've got to win tonight. Got something to fight for. So you'd better be good. Good luck, Kid. [Jim] Thanks. Oh, Kid, I don't want you to get any wrong ideas. Eve likes to go around with a fighter who can go in and win. Okay, I like 'em that way too. If a boy's got metal, I can make it gold. But just remember this, Kid. Eve and I are both on the outside, looking in. You're the boy in the ring. When you've gone, there'll be another and another. What Eve and I have got for each other'll go on forever. So if you still want me to manage you, Kid, go in and win. But don't get any wrong ideas. (light orchestral music) You know, there's another bloke I can't understand, Curtis. Who? Eh? Curtis? What about Curtis? Well you just said, "I can't understand him." That's funny, neither can I. Oh, gee. Hey, where's my book? [Happy] What book? Me book, the one I was I reading, you know, "Queen of the Spaceships." I don't know. Well, I've gotta have it, Burnsy. I just come to the best part where she's about to succumb. Who is? Cynthia, she's in the clutches of a hostile vegetable. Hostile vegetable? Blimey, she don't half get about, don't she? Hey uh, Burnsy, what're you sitting on? I'm sitting on me, what do you think I'm sitting? Oh dear, oh dear, look son, put it in your pocket will ya, like a good little boy. Well, bye Burnsy. See ya, Rowdie, have a nice time with the Uranium Lady. Eh? Keep an eye on your Geiger counter. (Rowdie laughing) (Happy laughing) (Happy grunting lightly) You look in pretty good shape. Hey, oh, not bad. I get a bit lazy sometimes. Who doesn't? Oh, you can't afford to be lazy, not when you're after the title. What do you think you'd do, suppose you won it? I've got it all figured out. I'll win that title, I defend it three times, I retire. Simple as that, huh? Oh, I know it's not simple, but whatever happens, I'm not finishing up like Whitey. I see too many of these boys hanging around the gym, picking up a quid here and there as sparing partners. Or getting five pound to fight for prelims in joints like this, not me, not this kiddy. If I get to that title, three fights, and I'm out. You'll never get out, not when you're on top you won't. Why not? I spent a lotta time learning a trade, the boxing trade. And when I quit, I'm gonna see that I've got something out of it. And I'm gonna get married, have a few kids. And when we start out, boy, we won't owe the world a penny. Well, that's as good a dream as any. Ah, don't you believe it. That's no dream, Curtis, that's real. Things change when you get to the top, you know. Well, maybe things don't change so much but, but you do. Perhaps I went up too fast, it was too easy. For awhile there, it looked as if I were gonna be undefeated champion forever. Then the Belgian stopped me, then three more after him. I retired. Most people retire when they're 60. I was 29. (door bell dinging) Hello, Fred. Hello, Danny. Peg, I uh, I've been talkin' to Jim. What's the use, Danny? Why don't you come in there tonight? It'll make all the difference to him. No. Why, Peg? I told him. But there's no good telling him. Once you've been to the top like him, the dough spoils you. Thousands of quid a fight, and it doesn't matter how much you spend, there's plenty more the next time. He'll never get it out of his mind, Peg. If you love him, you'll have to take him as he is, because you'll never change him. Well? No. All set, Happy? [Happy] You bet your life, Danny. [Danny] Anything you want? Yes, but Adams wouldn't let me bring her in the dressing room. They're giving six to four against you outside, Happy. That so? Yeah, that said that Watson was gonna spread that nose of yours all over your face. Oh no he won't, mate. He can hit me where he likes, but if he so much as touches my nose, there'll be trouble. That's all I'm tellin' ya. Somebody's gonna spread it sooner or later. Yes, well you can start takin' a collection for the first geezer that does it, that's all. Okay, number five, Happy Burns. Get a move on Happy, will ya? All right, all right, tuck your shirt in, I'm coming. Good luck, Happy. Well, on you way, Happy. Yeah, up. Good luck. Thanks. All right, open the cage, start the music, I'm comin' in. Good luck. (crowd murmuring) For the last time now, please. I've been asked for that collection box to be returned. Now I ask you. [Crowd] (muffled) Oh no. (crowd laughing) (crowd cheering) [M.C.] Gentlemen, please, please. Gentlemen, please, one of these collection boxes is still missing, and as treasurer of the club I must ask you, if you return it to me here now, personally... Now come on, you heard what the geezer said, didn't ya? What do what me to do, come down there and sort you out? (crowd laughing) Here, I'll tell you what I'll do. Don't go away, stay right where you are. Here, hold this. I'll be the first one to be searched. (women gasping) (crowd chattering) He's got what they want, all right, they love him. Yeah, they love him, while he's got it. Well come on, Jim, let's get the tapes on. [M.C.] Gentlemen please, ladies and gentlemen, this is a special contest... Danny. Yeah? Tell me something straight. You'd give me another year, wouldn't ya? If you keep out of trouble and use your head and don't try and slug it out with some of these strong, young kids, yes. I'll give you another year. If you're dead set on it. That's all I want, just one more year. (crowd yelling) I'll lay two to one on Watson, he's got it easy. Cocking Happy to death. Ah, what did I tell ya? Look at that, I'll lay five to two on Watson. Five pounds to two. You got it, with him. (crowd cheering) [Man] Take it in there with a knee. (crowd yelling) [Man In Crowd] Come on, Happy! [Woman In Crowd] Happy! (bell ringing) - Gloves off! (crowd applauding) You're letting him get ahead of ya, Happy. Don't fight his fight, you're letting him rush you. Do you wanna change places and let me sit down there with a dame by the side of me? Do what I tell you, useless, I'm dying by inches. I know, I know, you worry, all I gotta do is bleed. Doesn't Happy look nice in shorts? Oh don't be common, Jackie. Danny, Happy's in trouble, in real trouble. I doubt it. From here he doubts it. From not seeing any of it, he doubts it. I know what I saw, don't I? Nevermind what you think you saw. Happy's my boy, he'll be lightweight champion inside two years. You don't know anything. Oh, I know what I saw, trouble. Watson's left-handing him to death, murder, oh. (bell ringing) (crowd cheering distantly) Not bad for an old one, eh Danny? Looks pretty good. Here, don't catch a cold. Thanks. Jim. Hm? Uh, are you dead set on another year? The way I've got it worked out now, another year will give me all I want. Might lose you all you've got. What do you mean, what have I got? Peg, if you want her. Have you been talking to her? Well, yes I have. I'd like to see you two together again, Jim. Oh, it's no use, Danny. It's too late, we're all washed up. She's always hated boxing. Even when I was going good, she tried to make me swear I'd quit when I took the title. Quit. You think she'd be proud or something, not walk out. (crowd cheering) Sounds as if it's all over. Suits me, quicker I get in there, the better. (crowd clapping) (crowd chattering) [Man In Crowd] Happy. Danny, Danny. What's the matter, what happened? It happened so fast, I don't know. Watson landed a stiff left to the face, Happy let out a yelp and suddenly started hammering him into the floor like a tack. But who won? Happy, of course. He's a genius, you should've seen him. Oh, can we pick 'em Danny or can we pick 'em? [Happy] He shouldn't have done it, he shouldn't have done it. What happened, Happy, did he hit you? Yeah, right on the ruddy nose. Before announcing the main bout of the evening, I have to make one more last, and final appeal to all you gentlemen, sportsman, and ladies. (men whistling) (crowd laughing) For the return of the collection box of the St. Marks Boys' Club. I could do with it myself. Get outta here. And now, the management takes pleasure in presenting as our feature attraction tonight, a boy whose professional career... Good luck, Kid, you'll lick him. Thanks. He's only got his Sunday punch, Jim, he's nothing. Okay, ready? Deakon's just going in. (crowd cheering) - Good luck, Jim. Good luck, see ya around sometime, Jim. Kill the people. (trumpeting music) (crowd clapping) (trumpeting music) Come on, Jim, that's us. Come on. (crowd cheering and clapping) Gentlemen please, for the main event of the evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is a contest of 10 rounds, three minutes each round, of a match made at 12 stone and four pounds. Between, and introducing you firstly, the former British and Empire light heavyweight champion, Jim Kid Curtis. (crowd cheering) And the unbeaten, East London cruiser-weight, Barney Deakon of Bethnal Green. (crowd cheering) The referee officiating for this contest is Mr. Tom Blattner. Come in. (crowd jeering) Curtis and Deakon, you both, at the bell come in fighting and may the best man win. Seconds out. (bell ringing) [Man In Crowd] Come on, the old 'un. - Come on! - Come on! - Come on the old 'un. - Come on. (crowd chattering) Lay me seven pound to four, Deakon. Whoa. Yeah. You're on. He's a mug, Curtis'll run rings around him. If he doesn't, you'll run a noose round my neck, I tell ya. - Nah. [Man In Crowd] Keep at him, Curtis, keep at it. (crowd chattering) [Man In Crowd] Come on, Curtis. - Come on, Curtis. - Go on, Curtis, let him have it. [Man In Crowd] Come on, Curtis, come on, finish him. [Tom] Break. (crowd cheering) Hit him, Jim. Those lefts don't hurt. Get him. (crowd yelling) (punches thudding) (crowd yelling) One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Box on. Ooh! (crowd yelling) Get him, Barney. (crowd clapping) Beautiful. What I'd tell ya? Young Deakon doesn't know his arm from his elbow. He's falling for that old trick. That's all right, I've seen what I want. He can hurt Curtis, but Curtis can't hurt him. (crowd yelling) [Tom] Break. (crowd yelling) [Crowd] Ooh, ooh! (crowd yelling) (bell ringing) (crowd clapping) (crowd murmuring) Well, I don't know. I just don't know how five ordinary blokes can make such a mess. We oughta get spittoons for this room. Listen, most of these geezers can't hit a full-size man, so what chance you think they've got of hitting a spittoon? Well, the spittoons wouldn't be moving about. How's the nose, Happy? Ooh, that feels as big as a melon. Broken it, I shouldn't wonder. If he has, mate, there'll be trouble, I'll tell ya. I'll get a return fight with him and I'll murder him. Come here, Happy, let's have a look at it. I've seen one or two broken noses in my time, sit there. Well come on, sit there. No, don't, don't, don't touch it, Danny, it's painful. Now you keep quiet. Ooh! Well I've gotta get hold of it. Yeah, well don't hang on. Ooh-ooh. Does that, does that hurt? Course it hurts. Well, it doesn't click, it's not broken. Oh, I don't know, I heard of a bloke once, he had to... All right, all right. Well, I ain't takin' any chances, I'm gonna get an x-ray tomorrow. I don't like broken noses, they're, well, they're uncouth. (bell ringing) What round's that? Eighth coming up. Well I think I'll go and have a look. Good luck, Happy. Cheerio, Frankie boy, see you around sometime. Oh, I wouldn't be too sure. You'll wanna take care of that nose. A blow like that could finish ya, forever. (crowd cheering) Well, I hope old Curtis wins tonight. Well, I hope he doesn't. You hope he doesn't, why? He asked me tonight if I'd give him another year at it. One year, might as well ask for 50. Every fight he has now, he'll be taking more than he gives. And a year from now, his brains'll be punched so loose, he won't know whether he's in there or not. And how will the money help him? Some fighters are just businessmen who go to work with boxing gloves when the price is right, not him. He has to fight. And he must end up a loser. Oh! (crowd chattering) (crowd yelling) (crowd cheering) Two, three, four, five, six, seven. (bell ringing) - Go on, Barney. (crowd clapping) (crowd murmuring) He's still got it, Lou, hasn't he? Hasn't he? Has he got as much left as him? (crowd murmuring) You and your seven to four. Deakon's a three to one on shot. Me and my seven to four? The boy's too strong for him. Curtis has had it, what did I tell you? [Timekeeper] Seconds out. (bell ringing) (crowd cheering distantly) He seems to be lasting. [Danny] He'll hang on somehow, he always did. Oh well, cheerio, Danny boy, take care of yourself. Cheerio, Happy, you take care of yourself. Don't you worry about me. Here you are, Danny, show that to your grandchildren. The night you had Happy Burns in your dressing room. Ta-ta, boy, all the best. (crowd cheering distantly) (crowd yelling) [Man In Crowd] Come on, box him, Jim, box him, Jim. [Man In Crowd] Go on, get stuck into him, Curtis. (crowd yelling) [Man In Crowd] Go on, Barney! [Man In Crowd] Come on, Barney, you've got him on the run. - Ooh! - Come on, Barney. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Box on. (crowd yelling) One, two. Let's get out before the rush. Get up, Curtis! He wants to quit. Shut up, big mouth, he won't quit. (crowd yelling) Come on, Happy, you don't wanna see any more of this. [Man In Crowd] Come on, Barney. (crowd yelling) They should've stopped him long ago. Ah, maybe the whole job's a mug's game. You don't have to do it. No, you don't have to do it, but you always think, "I'm different, it can't happen to me." Now don't you worry. Ah, that's cruelty to animals, that's what it is. Poor old Curtis. (bell ringing) Are you all right, Curtis? Sure. I'll manage. If you can hold on, Jim, you might just get the decision. Now come on, breathe.

(crowd yelling) [Tom] One, two, three, four, five... - You got him, Jim! [Referee] Six, seven, (referee drown out by crowd cheering) nine. (crowd erupting cheerfully) What'd I say, what'd I tell ya? You, you never learn. (crowd cheering) Tom, Tom! (crowd cheering loudly) (upbeat orchestral music) That's our boy, Jim! Get him, the winner. (lively orchestral music) Okay. Ooh, what a fight, Danny, what a fight. Jim, you were smashing, smashing. I, I, I don't know. Now take it easy, son, take it easy. Frank, better get the doc. Why, what's the matter?

No, don't touch him, don't let him move. Where's that doctor? Blimey, Danny. (distant upbeat orchestral music) [Doctor] How long has he been like this? [Danny] Just now. (distant lively orchestral music) I'm afraid there's nothing I can do. He's dead. (lively orchestral music) (people chattering cheerfully) (people singing cheerfully) I'll be all right, Danny. I'd rather be alone. Okay, Peggy. (footsteps clicking) (people laughing) (people chattering cheerfully) Well, goodnight Happy, got your fighting done for the night. Are you kidding? All right, I'll take three. Three girls, you and Bob go by taxi, and I hope you'll be very happy together. (people chattering happily) [Man] Hey, stop shoving. Anymore for the Skylark? Hey, Danny, don't forget tonight's the night you put the gloves on Happy Burns, the next lightweight champion of the world. Cheerio, cock. (group chattering happily) (horn honking) Off we go!
