'My business is not just here' 'I know that Drink your tea' (Music) You think you're running the union efficiently? In the name of the union, you prevent recruits from working in the coop (Music) Hey! It's raining cats and dogs today, right? (Laugh) We finish our work whatever the weather condition may be As long as the union doesn't put a spoke in our wheel Hey lazy lout! Don't act smart with me If you wag your tail to me, Sethu- I'll burn you alive on top of this thatched roof Understood? He thinks he is Mr Know-it-all to advise me (Car Sound) (Car Sound) (Car Door Sound) (Music) What happened to the coop issue? I will...I will finish it (Laugh) You can't finish anything Murthy rules the roost He has the coop totally under his control We should chase him away That's my dearest wish It can't be done as easily as you think (Music) (Tree Falling) (Music) (Birds Sound) (Wood Cutting sound) (Walking Sound) My dear parakeet, I shall find you a suitable pair very soon, okay?

(Saw Sound) MURTHY...! (Saw Sound) (Music) 'Garudan' (Music) What is this booze? 'This looks like the booze we enjoyed the other day' Pour some for me - You said you stopped drinking - I said I drink in between stops! You pour Don't stop (Car Sound) Hello, Sethu Long time since I saw you this side What to do? Only outsiders get the privilege of taking a load downhill Nothing of that sort You are saying this with Murthy in your mind He is capable and so he takes the maximum load You follow suit too You listen to me First preference should be only to union members Only then to outsiders Try your fist power with someone else Murthy transports the load to the foothills in half the time your men take Even if I'm absent- Hey Sai, tie it with this rope If you oppose my union and me I'll bury you in this coop (Fight) Hey come Let's watch them fight (Fight) (Music) Listen, Sethu If I booze 2 rounds, load logs 10' long and start my 'Garuda' ...when I take the 7th bend ...you wouldn't have even made it to the 2nd bend Only because of that capability I'm taking more load than you If you want to prosper hereafter ...better for you to transport logs or men to the foothills Don't come this side thinking I'm your rival If you come, you'll die at the receiving end of my blows Why bother coming up? He could've got this treatment at the foothill from our boss, no? 'Your good time, I'm letting you go' (Music) - Hey!

If we throw a stone, he'll run away (Cheering themselves) (Car Sound) Hey 'Gujal' Rajendra You started yesterday from the coop? Can I fly? I have to drive downhill, right? Aiyo! Don't say you 'drive' 'Crawl' is a more apt word (Laugh) Hey! Cut the rope and come Cut the rope it seems when you cut my booze quota! Murthy, extra load today? My Garudan can take any weight If you go into town, find out when the next load is required Okay, cut the next load when I inform you Old lady, did you eat? Come, I'll buy you lunch Give just one Here - What is this? - Sticker This statutory warning makes me rush to the loo Then why be hell bent on smoking? My lungs should be as strong as Chhota Bheem's! Only this sticker will be the incentive to smoke When you lie breathless in a hospital you'll know Drink your tea, come, we must usher passengers into our jeep Hankering to make extra money on the sly (Making Tea) - Shankar anna, 2 tea - 2 minutes 'Pongal' and 'vada' What partiality! We get only tea and 'beedi' when we work our butt out You downed 2 bottles of booze That was when I was driving down and it vanished into thin smoke! You aren't getting enough men to work in the coop, Murthy? - Do you want to volunteer? - To take my life out? Don't provoke me - I've kept the cash here, bro - Okay Sales is really bad Don't worry, bro It will pick up very soon Whatever it is Nothing compares to Mahadevan's talent He borrows money for interest and somehow manages to make ends meet But the truth is he is managing only because of you 'I am not exaggerating' 'Bro does a good job of sweet talking' 'Shut up!' Go and check if the logs have been unloaded? Enough of drinking tea, go now Come One day you'll kick the bucket drinking your own tea I'll mix poison in your tea when you come here tomorrow Wonder what you served now! Why can't you spruce up the shop a bit, bro? I have set it up to this extent only with the money you gave What more can I do? Finish your work before the monsoon sets in Don't worry about the money What happened yesterday? I heard Sethu and you had a flare-up (Music) How can he get away trying to act smart with me? (Music) That's true indeed (Laugh) - Why crib about giving? - Here [counting cash] - Here - Rs 20? - Hey...hey - What, man? Free ride, huh? Pay up Take it Pittance Only Rs 5? Hang on to some lorry and enjoy a rickety ride! - I'll give the balance - You had better do so She pays peanuts And loads 500 baskets Moneygrubber! Too high to climb in (Indistinct voices) (Music) Murthy is here, so those who want to contribute for the vow, hurry up These good Samaritans have contributed an offering for you in the temple, Murthy I know what your vow will be! Return their money - Do you need this underhand dealing? - I told you Murthy doesn't like all this What can I do if you insist on giving? He troubled us a while ago Wretched fellow! - Take - Give it to her - Give my 5 rupees - Wait, I'll give Bringing the roof down for a fiver! Did you get enough for at least a quarter? I lost the last 5 rupees - Enjoy the ride - Is this a 'pleasure' car to enjoy? Then travel only in a Benz from tomorrow - Shut up! - Right...go Bro...brother Please stop Run...hurry up Get in (Car Sound) Looks like we should hang on to dear life for a lifetime We must have been born as bats in our previous birth Watch out! You may get stuck in the tyre Wonder if Murthy has space to sit in front You are better off playing cymbals to a vocalist! Stop...stop Let the human-load get down (Music) All of you, get down Murthy, see you tomorrow - See you - Watch your step Thank you very much, son - See you, Murthy - Okay, bro What attitude after getting a free ride! (Music) - Have you got in? - Yes, you can go (Music) This is where I have to get down Stop here (Music) - Get down with a spring in your step - At my age how can I spring down? Here, take your baskets - Hold - Ouch! I'm sparing you because of these baskets Or I would've sent you with the logs! Are you being so mean to me because I took my 5 rupees back? - You'll never get married - Cauldron mouth is cursing me! You are no better with a rhino head! Get lost (Car Sound) (Music) Vasu, this is the last load We get down and guzzle 2 pegs (Music) 'Thank God We finally made it' 'Wow! Quite a big house! 'Stop...stop' (Car engine stops) (Car Door Open) Work for the day is over with this Would've been great if we had got the side-cash So what if we lost out on that? If our bro nods his head we can get sloshed Just 1 small shot (Checking Car) You had your quota this morning Too much work today Sweating from head to toe - For you? - For the elephant in our coop! If you sweated it out it will be end of the world! - Am I right, Murthy? - Whaaat?! Murthy, huh? I've told you ever so often not to call him 'Murthy' I've given him a royal name Chathrapathy as in Maharaja! All of you should call him by that name (Music) Listen, do you know these people? Who are they? Bold and brave souls who protected this land and forest - What are you looking for? - Are they inside? Etched in my heart and mind I have named my grandsons after them I insist you call him only by that name Your wish is my command, Your Majesty What is so amusing? - Madcap! - Me...?! - I meant him - No, both of us Good Lord! How do they handle him? - Indra, bring them tea - Strong please - He said it - I have bile issue I don't drink tea (Music) Don't call my son 'Murthy' when his grandfather is around Who is that grandfather? Murthy's father's father who thinks he's royal family Aren't you Mahadevan's new recruit? My son told me Tea is good Enjoy the tea I'll be back (Car Sound) Won't he get down from his jeep? You don't get it Only this house and his 'Garudan' are legacies from his father Everything else was frittered as charity - Who is that? - Our Karthy and Murthy Our Karthy- - That racer? - Exactly His father's younger brother's son His cousin is an ace driver Why does Karthy harbor such hatred against Murthy? There was a feud in the family Karthy's mother kept harping on it and he bottled up a hatred against Murthy They were as good as siblings when they were young What is the use of that now? Regarding the coop I have a feeling something wrong is about to happen (Music) Dues haven't been paid, you've exceeded the due date by a week, Mahadevan Work has slowed down in the coop I haven't got the amount due to me I'll give it as soon as I get I won't delay hereafter (Music) This parrot won't buy your excuses You promised to stick to the due date I agree I said so, Karthy Still...can't you bend a bit in this repayment schedule? (Music) I have an idea Keep aside what you owe me Ask me any amount you want to borrow Your teak trees, coop and your contract I'll take ownership of everything in one go Except the trees you transported downhill Specify a reasonable amount, Mahadevan Doesn't matter if the rate is high Keep all that inside (Music) All that won't work, Johnny I know I have borrowed from you Even if a slight delay I'll repay for sure Don't expect me to part with my coop Then tomorrow at 10:00 a.m the cash you owe me should be in my box! 'What is the problem, bro?' (Music) I delayed my payment by a week So he wants to buy the coop How many times I've cautioned you not to borrow money from anyone? No, I didn't- If he has borrowed from you mark my word, he will return it Slight delays like this is quite common, bro You are anyway charging an interest on that, right? You want it by 10:00 a.m tomorrow? He has time to pay up You can leave now Don't poke your nose in a business that doesn't concern you Did you take me for granted like the louts loitering with you? I know how to square up this account If need be, this coop including you I can bend and get in my name I know you can get it by hook or crook But don't forget my shoulder is used to felling trees and carrying logs 60" wide My back doesn't bend or break! You are such a pipsqueak and no match for me, bro (Music) Better leave now (Music) (Water Sound) I believe Karthy wanted to buy the coop What temerity! His problem is my presence there If I leave he is scheming to take over the trees and the coop I won't let him (Music) - Pour some more - Give me the bottle (Music) Where did you learn to mix milk in this? (Water Sound) (Music) You must hit him 2" below his chest Only then he will bleed to death Hey Murthy! That tree is older than the usual ones Pour sour curd and saw (Music) What's in your jeep? Sandalwood What? Get down, man They are smuggling sandalwood, sir (Drawyer Open Sound) What's your name? Gora Sir, someone by name Gora (Music) Yov! You've joined new here You don't know about me, right? When you are all alone during duty hours at night ...remember my name Gora (Music) Shouldn't oppose without doing your homework (Music) 'What should one do to become a millionaire overnight?' Toil day and night I can't do all that I want to earn quick money and lead a life of luxury - Like Ambani - Who is he? There's one such millionaire In the beginning he was working in a petrol bunk Now he's richer than a king I can't be standing in a petrol bunk How long will I hold a pump? That will take too long I want to be a millionaire in a jiffy Like our hero Ubendra in 'Gokarna' Oh! Like that (Laugh) Listen, dear, why are you staring up like that? Any hassles in your life, face it bold & square Me too That's the only way to earn fame and fortune Hereafter follow my footsteps Let me see I have an idea Illicit liquor If we spend Rs 300 we will get solid cash 3000 We won't get a bad name for ruining people's lives Initial investment is just Rs 300 - Let's start today then - Right away? Okay You seem to have hatched a plan Listen, Murthy Vasu and I won't come to work in the coop from tomorrow Then I can see you after 3 months? Why? Give us an answer and go You'll get out on bail only then You think the police can catch us? They can't even close in a yard near us! (Water Falls Sound) Did grandpa eat? He had dinner his usual time and went to bed You, ma? I'll eat later You enjoy the meal Why later? Eat now, ma (Night Ambient Sound) Your grandpa was sitting in the porch, cursing you for not getting him booze (Night Ambient Sound) You never take anything to heart You'll always be equanimous (Music) You must bear this in mind I'm also getting old How can I cook all my life and take care of you singlehanded? Nowadays the gravy is so insipid If you want your meals spiced up go and find a wife for yourself Will do soon You treat life like a game (Music) I'll bring her (Music) Sai told me a girl living near the coop has her heart set on you She is good looking indeed I saw her photo You will make a fine pair (Music) She is too young for me, ma I'll give you my verdict after seeing her in person (Music) Are you truly jobless, ma? Eat regularly and catch up on adequate sleep, ma (Music) (Night Ambient Sound) (Morning Ambient Sound) (Music) (Car Sound) (Music) Murthy is here - We let our tongue run - Wonder if he'll stop (Music) Murthy Big bosses both of you are standing stranded here What is 'Gokarna' Upendra saying? One needs talent to become rich, Murthy You are well aware of it. Right? (Water Sound) Will you buy us a soda, Murthy? Get in - I'll get in first - Wait, man (Car Sound) Move a bit (Ambient Sound) Vasu, 'Garudan' has a minor repair (Indistinct Voices) Vasu, press the pedal What is 'pedal'? I know a cycle has a pedal Hey Vasu, what are you upto? I asked you to press the pedal Aiyo! Pedal? Hold this (Music) Sssshhh! (Music) - Press harder - I just did (Music) - Release - I did (Music) - Once more - Yes, boss (Music) - Release - I just did (Music) Okay Okay it seems 'Okay by all means!' - Er...let me check the load - Who told you to sit here? I thought I could help you Wow! I like that So accept you like 'Garudan' (Music) And the driver! (Music) - Has everyone got in? - 'Yes' 'Come, sit' 'Old lady, do you need a special invitation?' (Music) (Car Sound) (Music) Wait...wait Shift the gears one by one, Murthy 'He went to the 4th gear in one go' 'Ranger called me and asked us to get the papers regarding the coop' - His palm has been greased? - As usual, yes This is about something else Ranger Ganesh sir would have needed money urgently - Anyway come with me - Sure My son laid that trap to catch the rats Accidentally that wild dog got caught How can it be accidentally? (Laugh) (Crying) You'll spin a yarn to me and you expect me to buy it (Crying) Fine You've come to me, right? I'll handle it (Laugh) Doesn't matter if you can't pay cash How will I get hold of that kind of money? We are really poor, sir Don't do anything to my son, sir What will I do to your son, huh? (Laugh) (Car Sound) Sir is inside - Good afternoon, sir - Hey! Show some respect Lower your 'dhoti' (Music) What is that glare for? Remember you are just a driver If I catch you, I'll make mince meat (Crying) (Music) Sir...? Jinx of a jerk! Get out, you woman Out, both of you Wait outside, I'll call you (Music) Sit down (Music) Your documents are safe with you? (Music) I've got information many trees are being sold outside of the auction What is the matter? Are you smuggling this wood? What are you accusing us of, sir? We haven't felled a single tree outside of the auction Someone is deliberately malign- You've done a grave blunder I'm forced to enquire, Mahadevan (Music) Understand my situation (Music) That's why it is better if you relax for some time (Music) Let me finish the enquiry How can you of all people say this, sir? We will be in dire straits if our work is stopped, sir On top of it, so many of my workers are dependent on me for their livelihood Tell them to sit idle at home and twiddle their thumbs No, sir, can't you interrogate without our work being stalled? I should be the one to specify the procedure Just do what I say That isn't feasible, sir - I'll handle whatever the outcome - YOV! How many times should I spell it out? Don't you get it? If you dare to contradict me I'll evacuate the entire coop - Got it into your thick skull? - Yes, sir You can go (Music) Ganesa...! (Music) I know the person orchestrating this Murthy is in this scene even before Mahadevan got this contract When I crossed the checkpost with a truckload of seasoned sandalwood logs ...you opened the gate for me your head covered in a woolen shawl Panic prompted that action triggered by looking at my face But knowing I'm still in the picture you clinched this new deal, Ganesa Shouldn't you be at least slightly scared? (Music) Pick up that paper, Mahadevan (Music) I'll split your skull into two (Music) Take your mother home safe and sound (Music) (Music) Drivers are lowborn in your eyes, huh? We are men putting our life in danger toiling 24x7 for our family's welfare Whatever the distance and whichever vehicle When we grip the steering wheel whatever the weather conditions ...strength flows in our veins without even our knowledge We'll trample our way through (Music) You are not eligible to know the strength quotient of a driver If you dream of clashing with me just one more time I will pickle you to pieces! (Music) This is Karthy's handiwork, right? I'm trying hard to distance myself from aggravating this family feud But he is spoiling for a fight I have no choice but to smash his arrogance (Music) (Ambient Sound) Listen He's showing his devious side to us - Who? - That loan shark What is it? He buys the logs from us and fudges the accounts Boss wanted to meet you only regarding that (Music) (Car Sound) (Music) I think we missed the bus Teacher will yell at us Let's ask Murthy uncle for a lift Uncle, stop...stop Will you please drop us in school, uncle? - Get in - Hurry up - Get inside - Move a bit [overlap of children's voices] If you want you can get in (Music) You can go now (Music) Not getting down? I intend to Then get down Listen, I am not as young as you think You know I've also reached marriageable age What should I do? Marry me (Realxing) Get down If you feel awkward to accept you can just wear these coolers (Music) How long should I follow you like a lost pup? (Music) He's the culprit He has decided to clash head on To be on the safe side avoid riding your bike (Music) I can't win if I get scared for all this 'Ganesh had a narrow escape' 'Murthy thinks he is God's gift to mankind' Murthy I will not spare him (Music) I had decided not to deal with you in my lifetime But you asked me So I unloaded the logs What happened now, Sait? Sudden change of heart You gave me the same rate I quoted But When I weighed what you gave me ...there is a discrepancy What can I do? In any business deal, loyalty is important (Laugh) Money That is my priority I have given you logs from my best trees I have worked with my life at stake I'll ensure I collect the money you owe me I'll pay you for sure Equal to the weight given to me For the entire weight (Music) Only if I let you leave this place alive (Music) With the sole purpose of closing the chapter on your business I tricked you into coming here From this moment onwards ...only my men will fell the sandalwood trees This is my decision (Music) No eagle will fly above my money, Gora (Music) There is another species that flies in the forest Next to the eagle Vulture But it doesn't fly over cash But corpse (Music) (Car Sound) (Engine Sound) (Music) (Music) (Music) You didn't expect me here, right? (Laugh) (Music) 4 years ago thanks to you I got this in my hand (Music) Karthy Tony has planned something to take revenge on you (Music) I won't spare you I'll close your chapter today for making me taste bitter defeat (Music) After you ran your jeep over my leg that day ...all my dreams were shattered My vehicle, race, the whole works (Music) When I was lying on the road in pain, unable to get up I could remember only your face (Music) Pinning my hopes fondly I have been waiting Do you know for what? TO KILL YOU! That's why I am here But not now Before I kill you I must defeat you in the track (Music) After you die, I'll leave this place only after I bury you forever Ask your father To mark a good place for your grave You Finished! (Music) [humming a song from 'Sampathige Savaal'] Murthy How long will you do this engine work? This seems to be stretching forever, eh? I'm the only one doing it Actually...er...I thought I thought of coming yesterday But I had to plant some banana saplings - It isn't your job - Then whose? Shankarappa anna That's my father Exactly! (Laugh) That's correct Hahn! I forgot to tell you I won't come to work today I need rest for a day Please (Rain Sound) I know you're planning to watch the mud race tomorrow You guessed, huh? Why don't you come with me? Nothing important to do or deliver tomorrow I am not coming Most popular teams are participating Take a look at this It's a stiff competition That too in our village? See this list Your cousin Karthy is participating too You can bank on it, trust me This race will be the talk of the town! (Music) Come and watch your brother rock! - Change your mind? - Only tomorrow, right? You'll come? That's more than enough (Rain Sound) (Music) So Tony is back in the race (Music) He has come to take revenge on me We have an account to settle, right? He can't do a damn thing He doesn't know the new Karthy If we tell our boys the matter will be solved easily - Don't worry - No need We have to solve this ourselves (Music) Then he will also participate in the race For sure He has come here with the right jeep to fit into this race Should we get another jeep ready for this? Till date he hasn't made us lose I've won the trophy in bigger races only with my beloved 'Dare the dirt' This jeep is enough to defeat Tony (Music) Let him come then (Music) Collection has lessened considerably I'm unable to sell like I used to in colleges Everything has been tightened with police and security (Music) If you find it tough to sell in colleges, then sell it in schools instead Don't discriminate the genders Let them all be in a haze (Music) Don't come and complain to me about minor issues like this (Music) I have only one man in my mind Karthy! The moment he saw us he must be shivering inside out You should have killed him that very second by running over him I would have killed him then and there But I decided against it In the previous race when we clashed in the track ...he was the one who won He celebrated my defeat He can't die that easily He has to lose He has to lose and die drowning in humiliation In this race in his village ...we must defeat him and make him hang his head in shame But now I heard he is in fine form He's #1 in all the races I know that only too well After he defeated me in that race He rose to great heights in a short span 3.2 liter engine (Music) RCV axle Coilover suspension Lamda lockers Cut brakes (Music) I spent an arm and a leg and brought my Spider from Punjab with all these merits ...only to defeat him (Music) He and his jeep will struggle and splutter unable to compete with my efficient Spider (Music) After defeating him in the mud race I'll kill him in that same mire (Music) 'In our prestigious Off-road race game' '...we extend a warm welcome to all the participants and viewers' 'To accelerate the heartbeats of fans and make them speechless in wonderment' 'A race filled with bravery and bravado' 'The Raging Roars has commenced now' (Music) [crowd cheering] (Music) - Careful! - Watch it (Music) [crowd cheering] (Music) [cheering] (Music) (Crowd Cheering) (Race Sound) That's the way! I think they are jobless All these boys are from affluent families Must digest their dinner, eh? Brow to toe temerity Bro If rain chooses to show its power and the jeeps get stuck in mud and mire Boys like them have to come and save you In the midst of brave racers like a cheetah well known for speed 'Driving a Willis here's a tigress participant' Krishna Veni (Race Sound) Come on I like that...come on [cheering] (Crowd Cheering) (Race Sound) - That girl is too good - Super woman is rocking! Why is Murthy sitting over there? Not cheering the race with us? He got a pilot license when he was in 4th grade This is a toy race for him 'With fiery sparks flying in eyes and mind' 'Like a horse without its bridle' 'Ready to spring into action on the track' 'Off-road's uncrowned king who has never faced defeat' KARTHY! 'Karthy...Karthy...Karthy' (Music) 'Karthy...Karthy...Karthy' (Crowd Cheering) (Race Sound) Yes (Race Sound) Come on, that's it Yes...yes...yes!

No way this record can be broken Yes Tony? (Music) Come on, Karthy (Music) Saw his timing...05:03 He has messed up in 1300m track with a modified vehicle to his advantage - You think so? - He still has to improve You saw those 2 girls driving Wow! Killed it with their skill! But how can they defeat the boys? Gender is of no consequence in an actual race, I say If their vehicle had been better equipped they would have grabbed the trophy 'Even though the opposition's cheers echo loudly in the air' 'Waiting to mute their appreciation and win the race unrivalled' 'This participant who makes everyone quake with his demonic speed and power' TONY (Crowd Cheering) 05:03 Just five! (Race Sound) 'Yeah!' 'Yes' [crowd cheering] (Race Sound) Go...go...go (Crowd Cheering) [crowd cheering] 'With the shortest time ever the winner of this race is...' 'TONY' (Crowd Cheering) Soooper! (Music) Come on (Music) - Does he need this? - Damn! (Music) He bragged so much about his bravery, eh? (Music) (Crowd Cheering) Move...move (Music) You eliminated me from this track for many years And you made sure I couldn't participate With my strong whiplash blows you'll be rolling in this mire as a corpse This WILL happen Next race you participate will be the last ever Not here Right abovvvvvve us Sad, Karthy, you lost in the end even though you gave it all your might You can ask the ladies at home to participate instead But that isn't possible in this race? (Laugh) Am I right? (Fight) (Music) Are you trying to clash with my blood? (Music) (Fight) (Music) (Fight) If you have the guts ...show your skill by winning the next race Till the very end, you can never reach the finishing line (Rain Sound) - 'Hit him - Don't show him mercy' [overlap of boys' voices] [overlap of boys' voices] Hey! 'Use more force' (Music) Hey Tony Calm down Tony! I should have killed him right then and buried him in that mire He has ruined everything How dare he stamp my chest! Murthy His cousin If I can get hold of him- Tony, stop it Before we participate in the race in the State level I will bring him to you Face to face! I want him I want him here Go now I don't know what you'll do Bring him here somehow (Music) (Car Sound) (Music) Vasu, which direction did you feel when the fight started? North or south? You were nowhere to be seen? I have a habit of running 2 km away from any fight But somehow today my body didn't cooperate If you hadn't fled, you won't have a body to operate! (Laugh) (Music) Amma, you come here - Look who has come - Who, dear? You can cook later - Just come with me - Tell me who is it (Music) My dear Karthy (Music) Why are you crying? Let him ride pillion with you You can't bear seeing him cry, right? (Music) Come with me Enough of spending time here (Music) You are such a disobedient boy You'll never come up in life if you hang around here (Music) 'Get in' (Music) I said, 'get in' 'GO' (Music) Karthy will come back, ma? 'When he studies well and becomes a big shot' 'He will come home one day for sure' (Music) My dear Karthy (Music) I'm glad you came home at least now (Music) Why did you make him get drenched in the rain? (Music) How is your mother? (Music) Aiyaiyo! You have hurt yourself (Music) Leave him alone for a while I'll explain everything to you later Come in, I'll get you something hot to eat (Music) - Our grandpa - He's sleeping inside Let our 'maharaja' sleep peacefully - How do we arrange everything else? - What arrangement? If we arrange 'some stuff' in this moment of undiluted happiness Let me explain Like the prodigal son who returns home after being abroad for nearly a decade And he meets his childhood friend Balaji Some celebrations will be on the cards, no? I get it crystal clear Instead of enjoying the reunion why are you counting the notes? We shall rock and roll! Fragile! Handle with care, da - Drink tea and go - No need If I stop to drink tea, shop will close, no booze means I'll get withdrawal symptoms 'Just that or worse?' (Bike Sound) "If you garnish with spices aromatic our tastebuds will enjoy every bit" [singing a made-up song] Slit 4 lines and massage the meat with tangy and spicy 'masala' Fry onion, green chillies and stir Your gourmet meal is ready At least today I should hang on to the mutton thigh with relish 'Hang by all means' (Music) Why are you sitting here? (Music) 'Garudan' I drove for the first time only with my cousin brother That too, it was this same 'Garudan' I learnt right outside this house - In this jeep? - Karthy Let's enjoy, I've bought this stuff from outside We've got our supply We should have a blast 'The speed you show in your race don't show in this piece!' You know what I've never had any brandy other than foreign brands I haven't even touched local booze! Unless someone else pays for it! - Vasu - I was just kidding Your brand, guzzle it down Don't stare at me What is this rivalry between Tony and you? Why is he always spoiling for a fight with you? (Music) We studied Engineering in the same college (Music) 'Tony, Johny and I, all of us' Why are you obsessing about it? Forget it (Car Sound) He's showing off too much with that jeep of his - Heyyyy! - Hi, bro Where did you go, dude? We have lots to do He thinks no end of himself Tony, we must knock down his damn arrogance He isn't such a pro to be regarded as Tony's opponent But he performs so well, dude Don't waste time here We must finish our project, Karthy - We can meet the deadline easily - Presentation date is round the corner Did you notice their expressions as soon as you came? They are getting so riled up (Music) What are you planning to do? No one can be on the same footing as me in this college Tony [hooting] (Crowd Cheering) Tony...Tony...Tony Hey! Come on, man (Crowd Cheering) (Music) Go...go Karthy...climb faster Come on, Karthy (Music) [loud cheering] Karthy! (Crowd Cheering) Get lost! (Crowd Cheering) 'After that incident, students got to know I have an attitude and style to be admired' (Cheering) 'That's when the rivalry increased between Tony and us' 'We were handling a very important project' (Tools Sound) 'We spent a lot of time on it' 'It was a presentation for a national level seminar' 'We had pinned great expectations on it' (Engine Starts) 'We had anticipated every glitch with foresight and worked hard for it' 'Whatever it is, Tony' 'If I think back on how he bragged I'm burning with rage inside' 'His reverse driving video has gone viral online'? If the project they are working on is a success, then that's it They will kill us with their insults Tony, imagine the repercussions if he defeats you in the race You may have to join some other college! You have to defeat them come what may I'm not shifting college I'll hold fort here Like a king Still...if he wins the next race He won't win, dude Only 1 winner and that's me Tony Whatever they do, that project won't see the light of day He and his gang won't be in our college any longer Not only that Whoever disrespects me I will strangle him to death (Bottle Sound) 'He did what he vowed' 'The project we finished with painstaking hours of sweat' 'Just the day before our presentation' 'Tony destroyed it' 'That project would have changed our life in leaps and bounds' Did you let him off so easily? - You should've killed him on the spot - True that I would have Johny prevented me We were waiting for a golden chance to take revenge on him Then? (Fight) - You ruined our project - Let go of him - We'll get even with you - Come away 'You're dead meat, man' Don't show off So you got it good, huh? Before the bandage on his head could be removed ...the day of the college race dawned I defeated him on that day That was my 1st victory against him But his anger didn't subside He ran his jeep over Tony's leg (Painning) When we last saw him ...he was writhing in pain with his leg smashed So you have come here after breaking his leg Don't keep inviting trouble fighting with him Next month is the race, right? Let that get over Then he has to face the music I'll handle everything (Night Ambient Sound) (Music) "Rush in bravely to reach your goal" "Daredevil; daring hero" "Bold, brave and macho" "Behead serpent's head, your rival" "Bravest of braves" "Courage he displays" "Rush in bravely to reach your goal" "Daredevil; daring hero" "Bold, brave and macho" "Behead serpent's head, your rival" "Bravest of braves" "May you adhere to your stubbornness forever" "May your rival shiver in fear" "He is the braveheart; dashing who faces hurdles in his path daring" (Music) "He counters the sword bravely with his shield favorably" "Driving with fervor relentlessly Hands that sprinkle blood recklessly" "May your roar loud and vehement bring beads of sweat in your opponent" "May your target and ambition be focused like Garuda's vision" (Music) "His middle name is bravery" (Music) "Unequalled adversary" (Music) "Rush in bravely to reach your goal" "Daredevil; daring hero" "Bold, brave and macho" "Behead serpent's head, your rival" "Bravest of braves" (Music) "His middle name is bravery" "Unrivalled adversary" "Dare-devil is his middle name" "His name will shine in the wall of fame" Cha! We have to give up our booze session in the evening all because of this training Is that important? Isn't it our duty to ensure Karthy wins? So you won't booze till the race is over? Will I penalize myself?! This race is a biggie Doesn't matter who wins But if Tony takes the lead on us ...we might as well die! I agree 100% I'm taking part only because I trust my brother implicitly Najeeb is calling (Phone Ringing) Yes, Najeeb Karthy, I got all the spare parts you had asked for If you come in person you can collect them tomorrow Okay, share your location Will do (Night Ambient Sound) I must get spare parts tomorrow Take Vasu with you Only 3 days left for the race Don't create any ruckus and get into any trouble unnecessarily 'This isn't just a jeep like everyone assumes' 'If you take care of your jeep like your own sibling' '...he will listen to whatever you say' (Car Sound) (Repairing the Cars) Karthy, I'll just go for a smoke (Car Door Open) (Breaking Sounds) Najeeb sent us Jabbar (Music) (Light Sounds) (Music) You didn't expect to see me here when you came for the spare parts, right? Lady Luck is smiling on Tony That's why your vehicle and you At the same time In this same spot I'll close your chapter Tony has dug a single hole for both you and the jeep right here You won't be alive to drive in the next race 'This is the promise I made to Tony' Dig 1'6" more in that hole We will kill you for sure before we die (Fight) Hey! (Breaking Car Glasses) (Music) (Fight) (Shouting) (Music) When you ran your jeep over my friend's leg ...you didn't expect a leg for a leg, right? This is Tony's kingdom Not just your loving brother Let any big gun come to your rescue No one can save you (Breaking Glasses) (Gun FIre) (Music) Your friend will show up on the scene after this fist-fight is over You can tell him A big gun came with a gun! Hearing this, in utter panic if he doesn't pee in his pants ...then tell him The visitor was Gora! Gora (Music) When I used to fell sandalwood trees as a teenager without anyone's knowledge When I smuggled the logs through a short cut in the forest ...my enemies will chase me I've never known fear I've killed them on the spot the moment I set eyes on them Not one, but many You will share the same fate If my boys face any problem I will show my face I will bury you alive You need special eligibility to oppose our boss, kiddo You are a young novice Your punishment awaits you!
