- Thank you, Sir. - Bon voyage, Mr Plouffe. You'll be back when? It should be Friday. But with the fog in the Côte-Nord, you never know. It's bugging me having a husband who's always away. When I was a record salesman, I was always here. That bugged you too. Don't forget to listen to my message on the radio. Bye bye Arlette, my pet. Be a good girl. But I hear... a voice that cries out to me... Save me from the death... that awaits me I am young... and I want to live... Oh my father... save your child I am young... and I want to live Oh my father... Oh... My father... Save... your... ...child Ah... Rachel... When the benign protection... of the Lord... will entrust your cradle... into my hands I had your happiness... Dedicated my whole life... and it is I... who delivers you to the executioner And it is I... who delivers you... to the executioner Rachel... I deliver you to the executioner Rachel It is I... I... I... who delivers you... to the executioner. That was the immortal aria... of "Rachel, when the benign protection of the Lord", from the well known opera "The Jewess"... by Halévy. Brought to you by Ovide Plouffe Inc., the jewellers. And here now is Mr Ovide Plouffe. - Dear listeners, the musical part of my program is now finished. Now for my weekly personal commentary. We're in the spring of 1949, and our society is blossoming. A year ago I worked in a store as a record salesman. And now I am president of the jewellers Ovide Plouffe Inc... whose sales network extends to all the north of Québec. I did not go to university... however, I'm interested in every aspect of culture. But you have to know who to associate with. My partner, Pacifique Berthet, a master goldsmith and jeweller... Is he not from Grenoble, in France? The province of Québec is bursting with riches. The Côte-Nord, with its iron mines, is becoming our Klondike. Our ways are evolving. The war shattered everything. Our craft industries are becoming pluralist. Let's roll up our sleeves! A fabulous future awaits us. On that note, I'll leave you till next week. Until then, keep time with a watch from Ovide Plouffe Inc... the watches that give you the right time. This is Ovide Plouffe... calling you from Québec. - Hello, Beauty! Long time no see! I've told you not to come here! What do you mean? Ovide's not here, is he? As if you didn't know! But he could be back anytime. I realise that. Was there something you wanted to buy? No, I just called in to say hello. On such a beautiful day... ...my thoughts turned to you. It's the first really nice spring day. It feels like summer. If you hadn't become "Goody Two-shoes"... ...I'd have invited you to a little picnic by Montmorency River. Don't try and suck me into your crooked dealings! It's a shame that the small pleasures of life no longer interest you. At your age! You know it would, alright... two ex-fiances like us... ...sitting on the grass, like in the pictures. With a checkered tablecloth, Cokes, sandwiches... the little birds singing... ...the smell of lilacs. And you know I'm not dangerous! Eh? Stop trying to tempt me. It is a lovely day, though, isn't it? Yes. Listen... wait for me in Paquet's parking lot. I'll be there in 5 minutes. No one must see us together. No problem... I'll see you then. I'm closing the shop till 3 o'clock. I have to buy some clothes for the little one, at Paquet's. Oh? I'm still not the slave of this jewellery business. I didn't say anything. You're not answerable to me. I just don't like your tone. My tone...? You have 2 legs you can walk on. While for me, the first thing I look for when I get up in the morning... ...is my crutches. And the last thing I touch, going to bed... ...is still my crutches. Do you think it's fun to spend 10 hours a day in this hole... ...without sun? You've never asked what my life was like... Without a wife... Without anything. If you were in my place, you might be... ...less inclined to smile. It's true that can't ever be fun for you, when you think about it. Well then, I'm sorry. Isn't Canada beautiful!? Sure is. The mosquitoes still haven't turned up! Come and sit down! - Hi, Stan! - Who's that? Hello, Rita! Good grief, it's the devil himself. - Hello there, Bob! - No! - Hello, Maryse! - This feels planned! No, no... It's a coincidence! Really! You had me sleep with that guy for 100 bucks, once. Once too many! He's an architect. He doesn't matter. Take me home! Don't fret! He's with Maryse, his new girlfriend. He's head-over-heels in love. They say she's the most beautiful girl in Québec. Come and sit down! - Hello, Rita. - Hi. I can't help that I've missed you. Really? I was talking about you the other day with Maryse and with Stan. I try, but it's impossible to forget you. Goddamn men! But you can't tell me that you can do without it! She tries, but she finds it really hard! Don't sit here like a couple of clods... Come and join us. I want you to meet Maryse. Wait for me here. Bottle number 2! - That's enough. - Yeah! Here's to your love! To your love! Ta. So, you're a model? Yes... I travel all the time... Montréal, Québec... Must be a great life. It has its ups and downs. You know Rita has been... Miss Sweet Caporal! Once upon a time. Looking at her, it doesn't surprise me. I've changed a bit since then. Don't say that... You've never been more beautiful. Bob... don't get her excited... She'll want to finish up at the altar! With thighs like that, St Peter wouldn't let her in! You think hers are more beautiful than mine? That's what I'd call beauty! Have to be fair to everyone! Don't spend longer on her than me! You really are beautiful. Don't forget me, Bob! We're all alone... Life is beautiful. Hallelujah! Many customers while I was out? No. Mr Dupuis' clock is ready. You seem strange. I had a bit to drink. Really? Something up? When I know you're making love, it hurts me. What?! The Montmorency River is a beautiful spot, eh? You followed me? To protect you. Stan Labrie is a dangerous type. I know him. Good God! You'll tell my husband? No, I'm not a bastard. Don't worry. I won't say a thing. Thank you. Let me hold your hand. I love you, too. Didn't you know? You're only saying this because you've been drinking! You'll have forgotten by tomorrow. No... I won't forget. I think of you 24 hours a day. It's because of you that I became your husband's partner. You can't imagine what it does to me when... ...when, every day, I see men undressing you with their eyes. And seeing you encouraging them. - Yes, you encourage them! - It's not true! I know you encourage them! And I'm in my corner, torn apart with jealousy! You never look at me. It's you who gave me back a taste for life. I'm a normal man. I would've wanted to have a wife... ...children who I would have loved. I would've spoiled them. I would've given them... ...everything that was denied me as a kid. Without you, my life is meaningless. I'm not a happy man! A little while ago, I saw you making love. I heard you moaning... It was horrible! At night I dream of you. I'm happy then. I don't have my crutches. I don't have calluses on my fingers. Then, you love me. Oh, how you love me! Stop saying these things that don't make sense! Please... take all your clothes off! Just this once... As a favour to me! There's no one here... Ovide will never know! Please take your clothes off, just this once! I beg of you... Undress! I want you, Rita! I want you! Just once, Rita! - Please! - No! Never! - Just once! - No! Please! Never! You damned filthy cripple! Forgive me. I shouldn't have said that. I didn't mean to say it... Forgive me! - He saw us. - Who? The cripple! Berthet! He followed us in a taxi! He had binoculars. Then he came onto me and wanted me to undress. Then I called him a damned filthy cripple. The way he looked at me was really scary. I was afraid what he might do. He's going to tell Ovide, for sure! It's over for me, Stan! And it's all your damned fault! Shit! Shit! Shit! It was you who made me do it. Why couldn't you leave me alone? You're a fiend! What do you know about me that I don't know? Just listen to me... Stop getting your knickers in a knot, go home... ...and mum's the word... right? I'll sort Berthet out. You won't hear any more about it. I'm used to such situations. I so hate myself! Then I hate you! Now, Rita... No more tears. You'll see... I'll fix everything... No more problems. Hello, Pacifique! You shouldn't be too surprised to see me! What's this about? Don't waste my time. You know very well. If you touch a hair on Rita's head... If you say one word to her husband... ...you'll have your other leg to worry about. You want to finish your days in a wheelchair? I can see it now. Think carefully, you piece of shit! In the meantime... I'll warn the girls on Saint Roch St. not to see you at any price. It'll teach you a bit of a lesson. Just cool down for a while. At last! I've been so bored! You go away too much. Next time, I want you to take me. Ovide, I don't want to work in the jewellery shop any more. It's too restricting. Summer's coming, and I don't have time to take care of the little one. If you want to know, it's disturbing... ...to have a cripple behind me, watching me all day long... ...as though he had x-ray eyes. Has he been disagreeable towards you? Oh no! It's not serious! If you want to stay home, I'll get a replacement. That's all there is to it. One fine day we'll sell up, and you'll enjoy a year in Paris. If only that could happen! I'll go and check things out with Berthet. Go on up and I'll join you in 5 minutes. What's the hurry? You can do it tomorrow. No, I'd rather do it today. Ovide! I'll run you a bath, then... I'll put on my white negligee. - In broad daylight? - Certainly! It's even better... We're not tired! Very well... I'll be joining you. Wine...? Martinis...?! You wanted some PR done... That's what it costs. You always have good reasons. The business was to have been called 'Plouffe and Berthet'. My name was skipped at the lawyers... ...on the excuse that your family... ...held control of the shares. But without my knowledge, there'd be no business. This is the 10th time I've had to listen to this! Do the sales trips yourself... ...if you think I enjoy my nights alone in country hotel rooms... ...with a suitcase full of jewellery. Other than that, I'll have to replace my wife in the shop. You thought her overpaid. You'll see it costing more, and sales will drop. Anything happen while I was away? No. You sure nothing happened? No, nothing happened. Was something supposed to happen? Nothing happened that I know of. I think your wife may have got a bit fed up... ...with annoying people. What annoying people? Annoying people in general. She's so pretty. Which one in particular? I don't see myself as a private detective. What do you mean by that? What are you trying to tell me? It's nothing. Just words. A cripple's ramblings... ...from talking to myself all the time. A Tom Collins, as usual? Yes, ma'am! Your bath is ready. I put scented bubbles in, so you'll smell nice. Rita, tell me about the men who annoy you in the shop. What men? Berthet just spoke to me. That's right, I've cheated on you four times. The first three times were last summer... ...when I was Miss Sweet Caporal. I had everyone after me and we were flat broke, remember? It all seems like a dream. As if I wasn't visible. With an architect, a lawyer, an engineer. They gave me 100 bucks each. I was dying for it... particularly when you were sick. Since then, I've been quite proper. But... last Thursday, there was Stan Labrie... ...who came to see me at the shop. He wanted to invite me to a picnic... ...by the Montmorency River. I didn't want to go... but you know me! He was being so pleasant and I was so bored. So I went with him. There we bumped into this architect and his girl. He was the one from last summer. He got me drinking champagne... ...and I lost my head. That was the 4th time. I admire you. I love you. Kick me out if you want to. I wouldn’t be surprised. Just tell me what'll happen. I've always had a feeling you may have been deceiving me. Now I know for sure. That's something, anyway. Are you sorrier about them than about me? Shut up! Please shut up! What about you and Marie, your little waitress? You've been obsessed with her for a year. I've heard you calling out to her in your sleep! I'm sure you often cheated on me in your mind, with her. So that's worse than me... I never thought of anyone else! It's 4 o'clock. The little one's due home. You see to her... I'm leaving. - Where to? - No longer your concern! Say nothing to anyone, particularly Berthet! It was him who told you! Berthet never mentioned it. You're going to enjoy this. Incredible! My first evening in town and you take me to 'Gérard's'! It'll be a change from home in Rimouski! - Good evening, Mr Labrie. - Good evening, Gérard. You OK? Ovide Plouffe, the radio jeweller, was looking for you. He's in the corner over there. Well... I don't have time. I was just looking in. Don't disturb him. I'll see him later. Don't tell him I was here. You know what he's like... He never stops talking. - Come on! - We going already? Come on... We'll come back later. He's an extraordinary man. I would have liked to have introduced you. But he looks like he wants to be on his own tonight. He knows music, politics, books... You'd find him quite interesting. I think he's barely reached his 7th year. Don't! Cut it out! Thanks, Marie. I'm a bit angry with you. It's six months since you were here last. Very busy. Always flying somewhere. I hear about you from your brothers. And the radio too. I listen to you every week. - You do a good job. - It's easy. I really think it's good. I notice you've put on 'The Paths of Love' a few times. You know very well it's for you. Liar! No... I never lie. That can be risky! You've got problems, eh? A bit of trouble. Big trouble? You must have a boyfriend, don't you, Marie? I'm sure you do. No, I have none at all. At least that way I don't make anyone unhappy. So I do a lot of reading and listening to music. And take a lot of walks. Like an old spinster, eh? Hey, Babe! You've got other customers. He's not the only one in the club! He's gone white! - Hey, we want another beer! - Alright, I'm coming! Excuse me. So, what can I get you? No need to make so much noise. Hey... we're paying too! That's quite enough! Hey... don't be crazy! He's a gangster! We were just fooling! - He'll kill someone! - Give me that! You can relax, everybody. It's not serious. The gun isn't loaded. Come along! Fredo, music! Do you realize what you're doing?! My program! Your business! I'm taking you home. You should see a doctor. I'm sorry. Marie! Don't stand there. Come back inside! No... That's it for me. I'm fed up. I quit. You must see that it's no longer possible! I'm sorry, Mr Thibault. I can't help feeling responsible for what happened to you. Do you have enough money to carry on with? Yes... I'll manage. As a secretary? I'd have to know shorthand and typing. I don't. I know you have no family here. No. And in France? I never knew my father. And my mother died at the end of the war. I adored my mother. She was a singer. Very popular with the Germans. One day, she fell in love with a colonel... A remarkable man... dazzling... ...a refined music-lover. But she didn't know he was also a torturer. At the Liberation, her head was shorn. Next day she was found murdered by someone unknown... ...before she had time to understand. She was 38. - I see. - No, you don't see. From here, you can't imagine what it was like for us. No one should pass judgment on women's behaviour during a war. Life in Paris had become very difficult for me. An aunt arranged for me to come over here. There are still many admirers of Marshal Pétain in Québec, you know. But listen, maybe there's a quick fix. But please be honest with me. You don't have to agree. I'll be leaving soon to see about my representatives in Charlevoix. And I could offer you the same money, to come, that you were making at Gérard's. Then you could decide. You're not being sensible. On the contrary... it's a straight business proposition. You'd have your own hotel room. I need a secretary with me. If it wasn’t you, it'd be someone else. You'll see, the scenery is very beautiful. And it would give you time to decide. Where's your wife in all this? My wife? I learned today that she'd deceived me, for money. In Stan Labrie's network? As usual, I'm the last to know. I tucked some aspirin into your bag. You never know. And your big sweater too. The nights are cold along the river. Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything? I washed her apron. I put a bit of starch in the water. It's always better. Do you want to take it? No. I spoke to your sister, Cécile. It looks like they'll take me back at the factory. It's up to you. At least it'll give me someone to talk to. I hope you didn't say anything to her about us. They're not silly... They'd suspect something. - Bye bye, Arlette. - Bye bye. - Going to be a good girl? - Mm. Yes? You're leaving for 3 weeks, and you don't say goodbye? Bye bye. Can I hope that one day you'll forgive me? I love you, Ovide. So, let's say... 10 Bulova wristwatches... 20 chains with crucifix... 30 St Christopher medallions... 5 pairs of Fleur-de-lys earrings... 40 engagement rings, 40 wedding rings... 20 rock-crystal rosaries... and one grandfather clock... to be delivered to Monseigneur Labrie. That right? Looks like you're having a pleasant trip! Business has been such, that I've needed to put on staff. ...of exceptional beauty! Don't move! Hurry up! My legs are freezing! But I warned you... It's the Labrador Current. I've never liked jewellery. I even feel humiliated selling in front of you, but I've no choice. You know, my father was a working-class man. One day the parish priest came to see us... He offered to pay for a classic education for me to become a priest. My father refused, declaring... "All I have to leave my son, is his liberty." As you see, I didn't know what to do with it. Ouch! What's wrong? It's a cramp. Not surprising... with that cold water. No, it's an emotional thing. It's ridiculous. Does this happen often? It happens. - Getting better? - Yeah. Oh, night... come and bring... to the world... the calm enchantment... of your mystery. The shadow that descends... is so soft. So soft is the concert... of your voices singing hope. So great is your power... transforming all... in a happy dream. Howdy. Rita not here? No. Are you serving customers? We're still waiting for a new shop assistant, so... You want the clientele to dwindle. Hey... are you interested in planes? We get around the best way we can. Well, keep on being a good boy, Berthet... I'm ready to lift the embargo on the girls. Cheers! Wait... let me give you a hand with your bags. No! Berthet didn't talk to anyone, did he? I told you so! Leave me alone, Stan! I don't want to talk with you. You've been dressing like a widow ever since. Commendable... While Ovide is having fun playing the fool up north... with the beautiful Marie. What? You didn't know? I assumed... Go away! Leave me alone! Ovide! Ovide, I've caught one! I can't hang on to it! I'm sure there's not a salmon in the world as good as this. Not even at Maxim's. Maxim's on the Rue Royale? I'll take you there, if you like. Personally, I'd rather be reading on the banks of the Seine. We could take Saint-Germain Boulevard... go to Lipp's brasserie... opposite the Café de Flore... where we may see Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. And we could go and sit in the garden of the Saint-Germain church... in front of the bust of Guillaume Apollinaire by Picasso. And you've never been there? No, but I've dreamed about it since I was 12. I can close my eyes, and it's like I'm there. So you'll be my guide. It's gorgeous! We can go back to the hotel, if you want to. We don't have to sleep here. Why would we want to go back? I think it's very nice here. Good evening. What have you got there? That's my raspberry. Your raspberry? What do you mean? It's a birthmark. My mother was sure it was the sign of a gift from Heaven. She was convinced that I could cure all children's diseases... scarlet fever, measles, chicken pox. So, at the slightest illness... all my cousins came to touch my birthmark. It was idiotic. Saint Ovide... I believe I'm a bit feverish. I have some aspirin in my bag, if you like. Thanks. But I don't think it will be necessary. Good night. I don't think I snore. I can't get to sleep. It must be the salmon. I had a nightmare. There's too much protein in salmon. I find you a bit odd, Ovide. You're alone with a woman in a chalet... at night, lost in the middle of the forest... and you talk to me like you were a nurse. And you know very well that I want you. ...that I love you completely. I don't want to ruin the teenage dream that I'm living with you. Ruin... how? You must know I'm conflicted because of my marriage. You'd understand that. It wouldn't be fair for you. And if you came to my bed now, would that end your dream? You'd still feel you were deceiving your wife? You are truly unique. I can't help it. What I do know is that I'll always love you. I don't want to lose you. So break with everything and we'll go away together. Anywhere. At least you'll be freed there. Now, I think it'd be better to sleep. Good night, Ovide. Good night. So here we are at the end of our lovely trip. The one we take to Paris will be lovelier. The Paris that you imagine doesn't exist, Ovide... ...any more than does the image you have of me. I'm 22, and alone in a strange country. I've had my share of disasters. As for you, you're married, you have a child. You haven't forgotten your wife. It could even be that you still love her. That's quite a load for me. I feel too good with you, Ovide. I want you all for myself. As long as you're going to Europe... wouldn't you like Rome better? You could see the pope, at least. Next year, I'll have some beautiful specials for holy year. But I want to go to Paris this autumn, not next year. It's not my business, but a lot of our clients have been unhappy with Paris. Don't expect to find Corn Flakes or bacon. They've never heard of Jello. The cheese is smelly, they laugh at your accent... with the hand out for a tip between two wines. And the phones don't work. And the things I could tell you about the toilets! I'm telling you this especially for your wife. Paris is where I want to go... Left Bank, Hôtel des Saints-Pères. Well then...! If you want to play the martyr, that's your problem. But it'd be so nice to go to Miami. No interest? No? OK. Plouffe... Well, well... our big traveller. Hello, Mum. Drive me home. I need to talk to you. I've just arrived, Mum. Drop your bags, and come back and take your mother home. There seems to be a smell of good French perfume... along the river. News travels fast. Don't be surprised... The whole town knows. It's dangerous, Ovide... passionate love. I would've liked to see you, Mum, if Dad had cheated on you. Cécile, I want to talk to your brother in private. Call in and see Rita. She needs company. - Hi, Cécile. - Poor Rita. One has to wonder what was the point of him marrying! A nice cup of tea would do the trick. Have you ever heard anything about Ramona? Who? Ramona... your father's mistress. Dad's? Yes, my wee boy. You never knew about her. It lasted 4 years. If your father hadn't died, I think it'd still be going. But your father never guessed that I knew about it. What would that have achieved? The family would have broken up. I kept my ring. Now I can't even get it off. It's been like that for years. When I think about it... I still have a twinge in my heart. For men, it's not supposed be serious to have a bit on the side... But for a woman... it's the end of the world. Do as I did, Ovide... try to forgive. No, I could never. I'm telling you to try! Try! Take Rita with you on your next trip. It would be good for you to see Folbeche, our old priest. You could take him a nice statue of the Virgin, for his new church. He was always very fond of statues. You would gain by having a good confession. Shall I heat up your tea? No, thanks. I made them in the evenings. It's aluminium tubing... the material of the future. It's half the weight of wood, and much stronger. And that's not all! Look! Like a trombone. In the theatre, it takes less room. Then that's not all! Look at the little lights here. Do you know what this is? It's a flashlight! One in each, for walking at night. Crutches with lights is a real rarity. You put the batteries in at the top... then you push this little button here. The current goes down. And then it flashes on and off. Great, eh? Try them out! Much lighter, eh? Looks modern. You'll feel 10 years younger. How much do I owe you? Don't insult me! They're a present. I spoil friends of the family. Thank you for encouraging Ovide to travel with his wife. And here is a beautiful 'Our Lady of Seven Sorrows'. Perfect plaster, not a scratch. And look at the detail of her expression... Sorrow! Yes, it's perfect. It's rare, nowadays, to sell a statue to a layman. There's no demand anymore. But look at me, here... All those St Pierre Clavers, St Philippe de Néris, St Catherine d'Alexandries! I'm stuck with 3 floors of them! Want to see my warehouse? Oh no, thanks. How about a St Christopher... against accidents. The luxury model! With Jesus on his shoulders. I'll give it to you at half price. The good times are over. It was to be expected. The church goes too far, so you pay for its faults. I assure you I'm a believer, Sir! I hope that your priest will be happy with the statue. I think it's good that... your wife's going with you to Baie-Comeau. I don't want to meddle in your private affairs, but... you know what they say... Happy marriages make for prosperous businesses. You sound like my mother. You still taking the 11.58 plane? As usual. On July 14? Let's hope it will go well. It's mostly for my wife that it's important. Isn't that nice of you! Are you here to look for your sweet? Yes. Do you have a little girl like me? No, but I wish I did. Arlette! I told you not to come in here! Never. Understand? Do you understand? - I'm not contagious, Ma'am. - I didn't say you are. Have you seen the account from Dionne's? It's in the package, underneath there. Ovide, could you do me a favour? Depends on what it is. I want to blast out some stumps at my cottage at Saint-Augustin. I'd need about thirty sticks of dynamite. For transport, it's complicated, with my hip. They know you. So... they'd sell you that without difficulty. Yes, I'll go there, if that'll help. Very good of you. I just remembered, that account should be there... with last month's. I don't think they'd paid. 29... 30... Good... Your detonators are there. Don't forget what I told you. Don't fool with dynamite. Those sticks hit at 120 pounds per square-inch. We don't want to pick you up in small pieces. It's OK, they're not for me. I never miss you on the radio. I'm a Liberal like you. Go get the government gang! Here. Sign this for me. I should do my next broadcast on Alfred Nobel. You know that money from the invention of dynamite created the Nobel prize? Probably a man who couldn't live with the consequences of his actions. Do you think I should wear it? - Do you still like it? - Yes. You don't care about missing the party at the French consul's tomorrow? Aren't you starting to find the divan a bit hard? Not at all... I'm used to it. Oh well. Well, goodnight then. I think I'm going to start being happy again. You're a doll! Hi. Don't forget Mrs Pregent's clock. She'll pick it up tomorrow morning. Give me that... I'll put it in the boot. No, it's too fragile. Have a nice trip, you lovers! Careful with that... it's fragile. A small grandfather clock? No, it's a statue. A gift for our old priest. We'll take care of it. Trans-Canada Airlines announces that the arrival of flight 134 from Bagotville will be delayed... There's your ticket. What about you? Listen to me, Rita. This trip with you was imposed on me by the family. I've no desire to go on it. Do you understand? So you want me to go on my own? I shan't go. Yes, you're going. You're going to act like a grown-up. You're capable. You'll give the jewellery to the agent at Baie-Comeau... and the statue to Father Folbeche... and I'll be here to pick you up on Friday. I'm not ready, Rita. It's still too hard. And I was feeling so happy. What happened with us is not easily forgotten. When I get back... ...are you going to forgive me? Flight 108 for Baie-Comeau and Sept-Îles is now boarding. I feel so down. Thanks for doing this for me. I hope you have... ...three wonderful days. You too. I don't even get a peck on the cheek? When you get back. Mr Dion is wanted at the Canadian Pacific Airlines counter. Mr Dion, please. Still not leaving? We've been delayed about 10 minutes. Waiting for 3 American big-businessmen. Shit! Hello, Ovide. Hello, Marie. Lieutenant Philippe d'Ormesson... Mr Ovide Plouffe. - From Paris? - No, Dijon. Yes, the famous mustard. If you like. Are you going to dance? I'm ready to leave with you. When are we leaving? Whenever you like. Are you married? Yes, as you can see. Don't worry, it's just an air pocket... approaching the river. Hold my hand. Thank goodness you're here! Mr Plouffe...! Grant, oh Lord, your mercy to Rita, your departed servant... May she not suffer the punishment, for she desired to do your will. And as here, the true faith united her with the society of the faithful... So may your mercy have her join the choir of holy angels. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Leave me alone. Ovide Plouffe? Police. We need to talk to you. What's going on? The jeweller Ovide Plouffe has just been charged with the criminal responsibility for the death of his wife Rita Toulouse and 22 other passengers of the plane that crashed in Saint-Joachim. It seems the motive for the crime was the insurance 50,000 dollars that the accused hoped to use to flee to Europe with another woman. At this very moment Ovide Plouffe is being transferred to prison and a charge of premeditated murder will me made against him. His trial should commence in the coming days. Listen, I don't even know how to use dynamite. I bought it for my partner who wanted to remove stumps at his cottage. The statue of The Virgin... It was a gift from all my family for Father Folbeche. I went and bought it to be of help. And other than that, I never had a mistress. And I don't even remember any insurance policy. It's a terrible combination of circumstances. I must talk to my family. Call out if you need the toilet. But this doesn't make sense. It's madness! Officer...! Hey, Plouffe! What? Shut up, you son-of-a-bitch! Even if you offered me 50,000 dollars, Mr Plouffe... ...I'm still going to tell you that it's all over for your brother. The Minister of Justice, the Prime Minister... the American government, public opinion... Everybody wants to see him hang. Don't throw your money to the wind. I always aim to win my lawsuits. This one's lost in advance. Can you suggest another lawyer? A young one... maybe. One thing is certain... You must not be called as a witness. We don't want to see you telling about us and Rita. Do you realise how many people could be involved? High society people, government people! I'm aware. You had your girls being supplied to politicians. If that comes out in court, you're finished. It's up to you to save the city of Québec. I'm aware of all that. Your only chance is to play dumb. You're aware of nothing, you know nothing. You've seen nothing. Don't phone me. Sit there. Then eat. No one is going to eat with that son-of-a-bitch! There were 7 kids on that plane. He hasn't eaten for 2 days. Give him a chance. We'll come back when he's finished. Come on, make yourself. Eat. No, I'm not hungry. You were missed. Not me. One question... Did you know that your partner decided not to take the plane that morning? No. We found the joint accident policy for Plouffe, his wife and you. 50,000 bucks each! If he'd been on the plane, you would've got 100,000. A nice pot of money. What do you want me to say? Do you use fish eyes for bait? That's illegal. It's better than worms. There's no question of pleading madness. There's no other way out. All the evidence is against you. I'd rather hang than spend the rest of my life in the asylum. Anyway, your brother Napoléon agrees with me. Leave my brother out of it! I'm not mad and I'm not guilty. Can you please get that into your head?! I know, I know! Officer! Disgusting! If nobody is going to believe me, I'm not interested in living. Get out. This is the morning that we'll see the start... of the trial for murder of jeweller Ovide Plouffe. At this very moment... the prisoner is arriving at the court... where exceptional security measures have been taken... due to the indignation of the people... from the dreadful crime that he's been accused of. The public gallery is full to overflowing. Passes have been given to selected people for this historic trial ...which has gripped the entire world. This is Claude Saint-Amand... calling direct from outside the court. Get hold of yourself! Get hold of yourself... it'll be alright. All of Québec high society is here. I'm going weak at the knees! My name is in headlines this big in the papers. I'm interviewed by journalists from New York and Berlin. I don't even know what to say to them. My client doesn't even want to talk to me. I don't have a single decent piece of evidence! You have to look at this as a golden opportunity to get yourself known. Just do your duty. If he's hanged, it won't hurt the government. Think of your future! And besides that... you're sure to be well paid. Is there any hope? Your brother needs to help me a bit. But talk to him! As it is, you look more beaten than he does. Snap out of it! Save him! Please! You'll have to get involved. That guy's a real wimp. Give him a hand. I'll pay you back on the quiet. I've already told you... ...that it wasn't a question of money. It's appalling, what's happening to us, you know. I've lost my clientele... My bank manager has just cut off my line of credit. I'm on my way to be bankrupt. Cécile was fired from her job. My mother can barely stand... ...her blood pressure's through the roof. If Ovide is condemned, we're finished. All criminals cause serious problems for their family. It's always like that. Please rise! The court is open. Be very sensible. Keep everything to a minimum. I've nothing to hide. Don't compromise your chances of returning to Paris. Be discrete. You know that life will be calm over there. All will be forgotten. I'm with you heart and soul! Be brave! We dined together at the hotel. I was rather surprised to see that he'd engaged a French secretary. But I remember he told me... ...not to get the wrong idea about it. I hadn't given it a thought. I knew that he was married. But I'd never seen a secretary like her. So good-looking! He threw himself at us like a madman. It was a battle. Then... he pulled out a revolver. We were in fear for our lives. A real madman! Dangerous! He asked for 30 sticks of dynamite... ...for blasting out stumps at a cottage. I had no reason to doubt anything he said. Hey, Mr Plouffe...! When I told him to be careful, he said he knew how to use it. Oddly, at one point he started to tell me about the Nobel Prize... I remember now, he told me... ...that you have to be able to live with the consequences of your actions, ...then not be afraid to take chances. I remember talking to him... ...of the slump in the religious statue trade. He showed no sympathy.... He just said dryly, "One always pays for one's sins." That's a hard man... very hard. He wasn't his usual self. He started by cancelling his ticket... Then he took his wife's boarding pass. He told me to be careful with his statue, that it was very fragile. Then he watched it go on the cart to the plane. He seemed nervous. What struck me most of all was that he didn't kiss his wife as she left. She was a beautiful woman. He wanted to know the price of two plane tickets for Paris. I remember it very well... because I tried to persuade him to go to Rome instead, for the holy year. He told me to mind my own business... ...and that he was leaving for Paris in September. He was fixated! He wouldn't listen to reason. I explained that the cheese was smelly... ...that he wouldn't find any Corn Flakes... ...but mostly that the toilets... Thank you, Madam. Because for me, Paris is... In any case, I told him that his wife would suffer martyrdom. Because, as you know, the toilets... Thank you very much, Madam. He was very pigheaded. Yes, they're photos from a trip... with Mr Plouffe. I was his temporary secretary. Mr Plouffe's conduct has always been irreproachable towards me. It's true that he'd mentioned the possibility of a... of a trip to Paris under the same conditions. But I never really took it seriously. Mr Plouffe is someone who dreams a lot... ...and who seemed very much in love with his wife. That's all. Today the cripple Berthet gives evidence. It's a Westclox alarm clock. We sold them in the shop. It's easy too to use it as a timer. I remember that once I had tinkered with one like that. To start my radio set at 7am. It was... during a hospital stay. My little gadget fascinated the guy in the next bed. Who happened to be... ...Mr Plouffe. I seem to remember that... ...I explained to him the way it worked... ...but I can't be totally sure of that. The purchase of the statue was a suggestion... ...from the mother of my former partner. The box sat on my workbench for a long time... ...until the day of the flight. Anyone with keys to the jewellery shop... ...could have got in at night to... ...open the box. Anyone at all. Not necessarily... Personally, I have never witnessed any domestic spat... ...between my former partner and his wife. But I realized... ...that she was well aware when he went on a trip... ...with that secretary. She was quite upset. She changed. She no longer came into the shop. She didn't come into the shop because you'd try to molest her! She called you "that disgusting cripple"! That's not true. It's not true. But that's what she told me on the phone. In any case, I'm pretty sure! Of course, I've never told anybody. It was private between us women. Maybe it happened to her at home. I don't know. But I'm certain she was telling the truth! I accept her word! Even though Rita was always saying that every man wanted to kiss her... that's no reason... That's not what I mean to say.... What I meant was... that I can't give you all the details... You make me say all kinds of things. I wasn't there! I always had a great deal of affection for Mrs Rita. She was so gay... So joyful. She always had my respect. I'm tired... If you would allow me... I would like to sit down. It's my hip. My hip gives me great pain. Son-of-a-bitch! He took his old crutches to make himself more pitiful! Answer yes or no, have you asked the accused... ...to buy dynamite to remove stumps at your cottage? No. It's unbelievable! There have never been any stumps at my cottage! I never asked him to buy dynamite. That's a lie! You asked me to do it. You killed my wife. You have to believe him, Your Honour. My son never lies. We are faced with a dangerous personality. A megalomaniac... ...self-taught, devoured by ambition... ...trying to get to the level... ...of a university graduate. He'd finished elementary school. A modest leather worker... ...shop-assistant in a record store... ...an industrious watch salesman... ...he dares to go on the radio with a hotchpotch of moralising editorials... ...poorly digested memories of his reading. Success goes to his head. He falls in love with a young waitress. His behavior is repulsive. He imposes upon his scorned wife... ...the task of washing his mistress's clothes. This apron is just an example of the extent of his perversity. We shan't show more. We have respect for the nobility of this courtroom. His plan was diabolical. The plane explodes over a river. No trace of the dynamite... The debris would be carried away by the current. It's the perfect crime. But fate... I should say poetic justice... ...always catches out the likes of Julien Sorel! The departure was delayed by 10 minutes. The plane crashed onto Terra firma... ...killing all 22 passengers... ...including 7 children! At that very moment, this monster... with a smile on his lips... ...was dancing in the arms of the woman he wanted. Members of the jury... ...Your Honour... I demand the penalty of death. I must remind the court... that all the evidence against my client... ...is circumstantial. Admittedly overwhelming... ...as pointed out by my learned colleague. But ultimately, the Crown's case rests upon... the credibility of the partner, Berthet. I only hope that the jury... ...take this critical point into consideration. Members of the jury... Your Honour... Mr Plouffe... I leave this trial... ...very worried. Guilty. Ovide Plouffe... I sentence you to be hung by the neck... until you are dead... on the 13th of October next... ...at Bordeaux Prison in Montréal. May God have mercy on your soul. My little boy! Mum! - Congratulations, Jos. - Thanks. - You don't look happy. - No, I'm not happy. We're going to appeal. The Senior Counsel is sure that the judge has not been correct. It has to go to appeal. That will give us time to break Berthet. If not for yourself... ...at least do it for Mum. She's going to pieces. It's always the family, Napoléon. Rita would still be alive, if you'd all minded your own business. Marie, the statue, the trip with my wife... Stop it! I didn't blow up the plane, Napoléon, I did worse... I got you all involved in my follies. Above all Rita, who I never should have married. That's my crime. There's no appeal for that. You're feverish. Kiss my daughter for me. I'm less sure than I was. Ovide's always been an odd sort of guy. And Rita was no saint. I know that better than you. Suddenly he blows up a plane! It can be that! Wake up! I've see things much worse than that! It can happen, even with us! If you don't want to help me, stay in your corner! Not so loud! Mummy! If Ovide won't fight, we'll save him by force! With my oxy-acetylene torch... I could cut my way into prison in 35 seconds! I know... I tried it out yesterday. You'll go off with Ovide to Anticosti Island... ...to Ti-Me's cabin. No one will find you there! We'll do it at night. The big ladder is ready. There's no time to lose. They're transferring Ovide to Montréal in a few days. There have been 3 escapes in 40 years from that prison. Ovide will be the fourth! Judas Priest! You little buggers! You can see that this can't go on. Aren't your inquiries over? You've got the guilty one who's been sentenced. What more do you want from me? I'm getting fed up with it! You must understand... Investigations like this are never completely finished. Look... we received this only yesterday. What is it? The report from Interpol. About you. You didn't tell us you did 2 years in a reformatory in Grenoble. Nobody asked me. Is that where you learned your clock-making skills? Alcoholic father... tubercular mother... You haven't been lucky in life! No. When you arrived here in Québec... ...we know you were fence for stolen jewellery. We've heard, too... ...that you are visited from time to time... ...by girls from Saint-Roch St. Stan Labrie's little girlfriends? I have to pay for that. I've yet to find a woman who'd sleep with me for nothing... ...with my condition. Who told you this? Stan Labrie? Let me tell you something... Instead of besmirching honest men... ...it's his type you should investigate. A pimp! He often came to the jewellery shop. He knows more than you could imagine... about Rita Toulouse. You give me the shits! Excuse us for disturbing you in your devotions. I wanted to ask you... When was the last time you saw Rita? Well, I don't know... I saw her from time to time. That's normal. We were engaged once upon a time. Have you been talking to the cripple about her? Yeah. If you're talking to the cripple, you should talk about his geraniums. Geraniums that have grown quickly. Yeah. You're starting to look rather worried all of a sudden! I did warn you, though, to be nice to me. There's something hard here! Alright... You've got me. But I wasn't alone... He's the one who got me to do it. We were to share 100,000 dollars. You realize... because of 10 minutes! It wasn't my clock. It was the plane that wasn't on time. If you'll allow me, I'll get my better crutches. This'll be big news, Stan! Come off it, Jos...! You're not going to believe that son-of-a-bitch, are you?! Lieutenant, the statue! Don't you budge! He had dynamite left over! Albert! Albert, get out of there, Albert! Albert, get out of there! Good... torches, gas bottle, masks, hacksaws, hammers, ropes... ...the big ladder. We should do well with that. It won’t work. There's no other way! We have to get him out! It won't be necessary, Napoléon. I've given this my full attention. Your brother will be released. If I could just ask you a favour? Could you get this off me, please? Yes, ma'am... Yes, that's what I'm telling you. I knew her in Canada... What?... No, in Canada... Yes... Yes, I believe she returned to Paris... What...? Yes. Hello! Vestiges of the Innu civilization in Québec A lecture by Ovide Plouffe And that's why the Innu were known as the allies of French colonization. Unlike the Iroquois, who were subjected very early to the British Empire. It should also be noted that the Innu, by their sweetness and civility... ...were well disposed to French culture. I have, on several occasions... ...visited Innu villages north of the St Lawrence river and I've... ...often admired their... ...and the river full of agates... and protein and... We'll return to the Innus in their mountains next week. Thank you. Subtitles by FatPlank
