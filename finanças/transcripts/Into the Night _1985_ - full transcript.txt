Then the guy asked me why don't l speak to her nlcely, like l spoke to her... And... l told him lt was none of his business, and then he slapped me, and then he went crazy. And, actually, l did speak to him nlcely. l have to get up at mine tomorrow.

Go slt with your father, l can take care of lt. l'll join him in a second. Flrst you say 'let's party in Tel-Avlv'... and now you are leaving? - So just join me! Why would l? We're supposed to party, no? Leaving already? l barely drank anything. Come with me. What would you want? Another round. The girl served you, l don't... She had Pina Colada, l had Chlvas with coke. Drop the coke, lt ruins the whiskey. That's how l like lt, none of your business! 'Screwdrlver', comes with orange or grapefrult julce? -Orange julce. Go slt with your father? He looks totally lost. l'll ask Glora to, he'll be rlght there. Hello. - Hey Glora, what's up? Where are you? lt's been a long time. l had reserve duty, you know... - What a bugger. lt's mental out there, trust me. My dad ls here, later... Everyone knows you here... Come, have a drink with me. What would you like? And you? l'll have frozen vodka, with some beer. l'll just have a beer. - Beer. Brurla. Beer, and my usual. Do you drink a lot? l try not to. What do you think about Doddy? You flt here better. Why? Just because... You know that he ls going to New York? No. - To learn photography. Tlll he gets to New York, lt could change to florlstry. in the meantime l want him to run the bar. Why don't you call mom? Just talk to her. l've got nothing to say to her. Then stay with us, and l wlll flx lt. l actually want to go back to Nahariya. l don't like lt here. Here, now lt's working. Look at me. - Stop dad, l have to run. There ls that unlt meeting at the bar, l want to take photos. What, your mates? No, Glora's, but l know them. Aml was my commander too. Well, you got lt... Now glve lt to me. He gets along with them? He's fine, the ellminatlon didn't make such a dlfference. l think lt even helped him, they admlre him as always. And how ls he? He's fine. What exactly happened in Lebanon? l've never understood lt. Glora led a convoy, and stopped where he thought lt was too dark and qulte. He was worrled of an ambush or mines in there. So he reported lt to his dlvlslon commander, who didn't glve a damn, and sent him there anyway. So he went and indeed there were mines and an ambush, and people were killed and captured, don't ask... The army held Glora responslble and he was dlsmlssed. A week ago, the guy that was his drlver, was released from captlvlty, and he ls the only one who heard Glora talking to his commander, l hope he ls going to testlfy about lt. "The Sliver shoes took but three steps, "and then she stopped so suddenly, that she rolled over, "upon the grass several times, before she knew where she was. "At length, however, she sat up and looked about her. "Good graclous!" she crled." Hello. - Hello. Come on in. did you ask her to come? Of course, tonight ls the unlt meeting. But you know that unlt nights... Why are you making a scene? - l'm making a scene? You know that women are not invlted to unlt nights. Stop with the bullshit, Dina always comes... Because ldo lsn't a man enough. - Ok, llsten... From now on l don't want to know or hear anything! Not about unlt nights, or your dad drlving you crazy, or your bar being smashed, now take me somewhere. Where? -l don't know. l'm not going to tell the babysltter, you're not taking me, rlght?! Have l ever told you that my dad drlves me mad? l can't just show up at this friend's house, without any notlce, and say that my husband doesn't want me around. Stop apologlzing all the time. lt was a great ldea that you turned to me. Let's slt here for a while. Hey, what's up? Looking good. - l'm fine. Are we the flrst ones to arrlve? - Yes, Mr Lawyer. Look, my drlver was just released. Stop, stop, let's dlscuss lt later... l didn't allow him to take the equlpment. lt wlll be alrlght. - lsn't lt your brother? -Yes lt ls. You have a better beach in Nahariya. Yes. Less storms and whlrlpools. Glora ls in a totally dlfferent Directlon than what we thought. At least, from what l thought. You know, when he was 17, he used to take maths courses in college. They used to say he was extremely talented. Now he seems so far from lt. l just want lt all to be better. That he wlll qult the bar and all the nonsense, l am certain that he ls much better there. And what about you? What about me? How are you? The truth? Horrlble. Just horrlble. l feel like l have a hole in here, in my heart. like a lump stuck in my throat. l don't know what to do, l really don't. did you speak with her? She doesn't want to llsten. The flrst time l vlslted New York, my Engllsh was really bad. Not that today lt's that good. - True, lt's stlll not so good, so lmagine lt back then. - Why are you so..? He ls actually a medlcal doctor. l landed there, all alone, l stopped a taxl at the alrport... Glora, are you coming, or should l stop the story? Go, slt with the mates. - lt's fine, you can go back. Chat with them a blt. Anyway, untll l got the nerve, and told the drlver "l want to go to the city", which my slster taught me to say, he turns to me and says, just say 'to the city' (Hebrew), don't work so hard! in Hebrew! l almost fell off my chalr. l actually sald lt qulte well: "l want to go to the city". ls lt true that your dad ls a Chrlstlan? Yes, who told you? Doddy, just now. What made you talk about my dad? He ls his dad too... - Yes, but he ls a secular. He even worked for the HMO. No that lt even matters, 'cause our mom ls Jewlsh. Go to the kltchen. Come here. Let's see who's the man here... Come. You come. Very lmpresslve... You pulled lt off this time... But l wlll fuck you. On my mother's grave, l wlll fuck you! Son of a bltch! Shut up, you plece of shit! Why didn't you shoot lt? - Shoot lt? l was totally paralyzed. Do you want to have a night swlm? l can't swlm. Come on, let's make a move. You know what? l'm going to see once and for all what are these unlt nights, where women are not allowed. You know that Doddy and Glora are going to Nahariya tomorrow? Why don't you come with me tomorrow? - with them? No, just us two. What for? Just to vlslt the city, the house, the greenhouse. We can also go to the beach, lf you want. So where did you two meet? Here, at work. Who worked here before, you or her? How does lt matter to you? Why did you call me for? l asked her to. Bring another vodka, would you? But in a normal glass. Wow, what a surprlse! Where ls everyone? That's what left. Hl. - Hl. l'm glad you came. Really? Wlll you have sex with me? You're amazing. l love you so much. Only me? Yes. Llar. Llar. lf you asked me, say, how much ls 423 multlplled by 832, l wlll calculate lt in my head in no time, but this ls not math, lt's something dlfferent, Are you llstening? Mom ls probably angry that l come just now. Let her be angry. You work, what can you do? Doddy... Hl ls anybody home? No Flrst of all, call him and tell him not to come Why should l tell him not to? He comes here every day lt wlll be unpleasant for everyone, do me a favor and call him He already left lt's fine Arthur ls sensltlve enough lf he was that sensltlve, he wouldn't meet us so soon He whould wait with that lt's not so simple l know lt's not simple, so no need to compllcate lt even more Was l supposed to lle to you? How could you lle? l could have told you lt wasn't serlous, that lt wlll soon end So what are you saying? What do you mean, what am l saying? l'm saying that this man l'm saying that l do have every rlght Nobody sald that you don't Don't you think l know you enough to flgure what you think? What do l think? You think that l'm wrong Wrong with you, wrong with dad l think lt's not Ok - Why? Think for yourself - Where are you going? To the greenhouse Whose car ls this? - Her friend's We're acting a blt like two robbers, no? No one wlll catch us, don't worry Here's Doddy!

Why doesn't he go to the army to sort lt out himself? He doesn't want to get involved, he thinks that lf he goes there, and take care of lt, he would seem like a groveler, so he lets others flx lt ldo served with him, he loves him and wants to help, He ls in the background, pulling the strings, and he looks at the entlre army like a friend who betrayed him This ls probably true, but every time lt comes up, even when someone trles to help, lt hurts him all over again Just leave lt for tomorrow morning l'm sleeping in the morning What do l care lf they left without paying, You should keep your eyes on them l'm not paying you for that But you sald he was your friend What friend? Who the hell ls he? Whoever clalms to be my friend can just dlsappear? ls lt your dad's money? They suddenly left, l didn't even notlce Of course you didn't, so how can you say lt was my friend?
