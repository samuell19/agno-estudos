Daughters of Destiny In the episode "Elizabeth" In the episode "Jeanne" In the episode "Lysistrata" Good evening. Let me introduce myself. I'm Destiny - your fate, as you call me. Most of you think of me as all powerful, a God who twists your lives at my whim. On the contrary! It is I who lies helpless in your hands. You lead your lives good or bad, and I only watch and keep the tally. I'm going to prove it to you in the three films that follow... Centuries of time and vast distances of space separate our stories and our heroines, but one thing their destinies held in common, they all faced war: ELIZABETH, who was scarred by a war... JOAN, who waged a war... LYSISTRATA, who tried to stop a war... While we all pray for men to put an end to war forever, we can be quite sure that women will always remain women... Elisabeth. "All men's reasoning are not worth the sentiment of a woman..." Voltaire. Les voyageurs en provenance de New York et se rendant ? Rome trouveront le car en partance dans la cour n?2. Il viaggiatori provenienti da Nova York e diretti a Roma troveranno il pullman in partenza nel cortile numero due. - Can I have a car directly? - Certainly, at the gate. Good day. Good day, Madame.

His name was Captain Whitefield You are Elizabeth Whitefield? He spokes very much of you. What's your name? - Angela. You must have been a child at that time. - No, I was seventeen years. That's what I meant. You know I - I never understood exactly what happened. No one seemed to know anything. Not even the War Department. All they could tell me was that Tony escaped from the prison camp, and tried to cross the enemy lines. - Wanta see my house? - Oh yes thank you. Perhaps you could tell me something about it? Do you remember anything? One evening late I go out to get the water... The night of the tenth February nineteen forty four, I see a man who was hiding there. Then I call my mother.

Mama answers, No, he would like some wine. and he repeate wine, and smiles, mama smiles also, and me take him into kitchen. - Was he very very cold? - Certain, because he was wounded.

You still live ina New York? - Yes, I do. East eighty second street. You know the address... Tony lived there when he was a boy. It's the same place we lived in ever since we got married. It's almost as though he were still alive... Just away on a long trip somewhere... Once in the middle of the night I woke up... and I saw a light coming from under the door of his study. The maid had forgotten to turn it off. For a moment I thought... - But you did not know it. - Oh yes I know. I'm sorry... I'm not used to wine. You are beautiful. He used to say that always. You are not marry again? - No. Is bad for a woman to stay alone. I am not alone really. Live with your parents? No, but I have all his books and his letters. He used to write to me every day until he was captured. You see it was the first time we were ever separated in the six years. Have many photographs of him? No. I don?t need photographs. The old man at the cemetery said, that only the mothers come back to visit the graves, not the wives. But has he ever stopped to think what it means to a wife to... ...to come and stand over the grave of the man who has her whole life? How could she forget? Let him die a second time? Poor thing... Oh Angela, I shouldn't impose on you like this. No. You bother not. Is always like this signora, we all have many troubles. You... You're a nice girl. Madame, there is someone here. Pardon me signora, I will come back right away. Please sita dawn. I coma back right away. I come for the Madame. I'm going to look for her. Angela, I want to ask you a great favour. Would you let me stay here with you over night? But I don't know what to... I'm afraid here is no good place Your house is lovely. You couldn?t get used to it. Hotel be for you better, there's hotel in passe. The city. I will take you. Oh, please if you let me, I had loved to stay. The bed is hard, there?s no water or light. No it is not for you at all signora. Tony lived here, didn't he. Oh please please Angela tell the driver to come back tomorrow. Thank you, I know you would understand. Me isa forget, me musta go to the village. Please you go also, it is not very far you know. If you don't mind, I, I had rather wait for you here. As you wish. What are you doing here? I was told to wait here quietly. What are you doing here? Mama told me to stay here, and close the door. - Mamma? - Yes. But... Mamma Angela? - Yes. These two are dead. - Dead? - Yes, they're soldiers. What is your name? I'm Antonio. Oh, don't play like that, you mustn't play like that. You mustn't play like that, oh war is bad, bad! Why are you crying? What have I done now? Nothing, Nothing. Mama. Don't say anything to mama that you were here. No, I won't say anything - Have you been good? - Yes. Hug mama. You've been playing with your soldiers. Don't make noise, because there is a lady here. Look what mama brought you. It's good. You have been waiting much, you know why I needa something, and they say did not have it. So I ask the storekeeper to please look everywhere till he finds what I ask. It's tea, you will be pleased? He liked the tea too. And a... also the wine. In America he never touched wine. Here he began like it. Are you not tired signora? Yes I am tired. I am going down early to the cemetery tomorrow, I have to be there early. - Why? I have come to take my husband back home I will wake you early. Don't worry. Come, madame. Is not comfort I told you. - Oh everything is fine. It's the room of my parents in here. - Don't you want the lamp? - Is no matter I have a candle. Good night. - Good night. Mama, who is that lady? Why do you always want to know everything. Go to sleep... Good night. I was thirsty, I was going to get a glass of water. Is raining out, I will bring it to you upstairs. Thank you. You better sleep now, signora, am going to sleep too. Angela, don't go, sit here. Isn't there something more you want to tell me about Tony? Did he ever learn to speak Italian? Si, he can speak a little, signora Elisabetha. Isa bad to... I shouldn't what? Is a bad to be sad too much, isa bad to think of old stories. Don't you think I have a right to know? Mama, mama. Good, good, dear Antonio, have no fear, mama is here... Maman is here. No, put him down there. Go to sleep now, Antonio, go to sleep. Don't cry Antonio. His name is Antonio, him too. Go to sleep now, Antonio, go to sleep. Why did you try to hide him from me, if I had gone inside the barn, I might never have seen him? I no wanted you to know it. - But why, what were you afraid of? - I no want you to be hurt. All these years, I... I was afraid to come here... It's... it's almost... ...as if I had known. There was the war. Was it the war that made you fall in love with him? I no lova Antonio. You don't have to lie to no now, he was here with you three months, wasn't he? I no love him, you maybe think I'm bad, but in the war, everyone gets crazy, you don't how it was, but at the time it was the war. The night of the tenth of March, the nazis raided the house that night, Antonio no tried to get across the lines... What? No impossible he be stay because he was a wounded very bad. and when he decided, than it was too late. That night... I will never forget it... My mother and I, we were waiting for it... Since months on knew that the Americans were going to attack, and drive the Germans back. The Germans know they could find horses and food in the farms. They took everything with them. They were also going to come to us... and when searching the house, they were going to find Antonio... I only had one idea... Antonio had to get away. When I got upstairs... I understood immediately that Antonio did not have the force to escape. Nein, hier ist niemand. Weiter. Hier im Stallen, da ist ein Kuh... Hier, mitnehmen. Alles hierher! Zeit. Keine Zeit verlieren! Wir mussen weiter. At that moment... at that moment only... Antonio looked at me... He had never looked at me like that... It was the first time... Antonio was killed on the 12th of May by a stray bullet. Voil? Elizabeth. You wanted to know. He was an unlucky man, that's all. Like father, like son. Take your husband. It is right, his place is no here. Because... - What? Antonio only loved you. Whenever there is a storm, the boy becomes agitated like that night. The guardian of the cemetery says he is a war child. - Angela... Give him to me. - Give him to you? Let me take him too. I will do what is necessary. I will raise him well. I will send him to the best schools. He will be happy, he will want for nothing. Tell me that I can have him. I am his mother, and you cannot take him from me. Bonjour Madame. You were right, they were all good men, Tony was good, only the war is evil, when the car arrives from Rome, will you tell the men Captain Whitefield will remain here with his friends... and with his son. Bien Madame. There! You see? For too many years, Elizabeth bemoaned what she thought was her destiny. But you don't think I had anything to do with it, do you? As a matter of fact, I was so busy with personal matters, at the time I didn't even know she was alive... Joan. What women want, god wants it. After the rescue of Orl?ans... After the coronation of Charles VII at Reims... After three months of unbroken victories... Joan met with a grave disaster near Paris. Abandoned by her king, without army, almost alone, Joan decided to continue her mission: Throw the enemy out of France. Now there's the case of Joan... Look, Joan! It's those killers from Paris again. Poor souls! Because they were my friends... how many churches are there in Paris, Pasquerel? - Eighty. - That many! And in all those churches, they are praying God against me. I'd much rather not have Paris against me. Too many churches. I've had enough! Enough! I can't go on, do you hear? I'm fed up! It was bound to happen! Yes, I should have gone on foot, but I was too tired! We're all entitled to be! I refuse to go on, I'm starving! You worry too much about yourself! And you don't worry enough other people! They're all fed up, all of them. Since I'm your brother, I can afford to tell you the truth: I'm fed up completely! I can hear you Pierre. Why do you shout? - Because I'm fed up, I tell you! Well, go back then. We'll go to Compiegne without you. Yes, you can go to, Compiegne without me. The King will be pleased to see you again. - The King! Ha! The way you defied him, he's more likely to hang me! But he's made a noble-man of you. He wouldn't hang you. He'd chop your head off. I'd be hanged though, if I ever went back, but I'm going on. Do as you like. As for you, Joan, this is the last time I'm telling you: I'm going home. You'll be forgiven, if you come. I'm warning you, it's your last chance. Pierre, for the last time I tell you, no. All right, then, I'm going! I'm sorry, but it seems to me the horses are for those who are going to need them... Where shall I go on foot? Oh, that's your concern. Take this one, if you like, he's no use to us anymore. What if I'm attacked? You'll defend yourself. Look Pasquerel, my sword is broken! You can't leave me without a horse. What if I come across the English? What can I do without a horse? - Well, you'll just run away! Now listen, Pasquerel, you can't let me go off all on my own! Joan, please! Saint Catherine, Saint Margaret, Saint Michael, what shall I do? Is it right for me to go to Compiegne? Saint Catherine, Saint Margaret, why do you speak to me no longer? Are you angry with me? Is it because I'm going to Compiegne? You haven't the right to be silent when you've always spoken to me! Today, I no longer know what to do. My voices: My voices! If you want me to stop, then at least you must tell me. You know I'll go on unless you tell me not to. If you don't want to answer me, just let me know. I won't call on you anymore. But I beg you, please, come and say good bye. Joan, look out! My Lord, let why will be done! Joan! My beauty! Stop, you fools! It's the Maid! Noiroufle! Noiroufle! What are you doing here? Well, we saw some horses, but we didn't know they were yours. - Still a thief! Oh no! They're not for me! They're for the captain! - Which Captain? - Still the same one: Baretta! Baretta! Is he here? That's a piece of good news! D'Aulon, Baretta's here. Good news, you churchgoers! The Maid's on her way here! Get out of here! The Maid has come! What! Which Maid? Joan, The Maid of Orleans. Thunder and lightning! Here? Outside! Yes, she says she has word for us. Are we leaving again? May be, not you. She's not too fond of you and your kind, my sweet But what's going to happen to me? Dress and pack my things for me. Be quick about it! She may decide to leave immediately, you never know with her. Anyway a man has to get down to work sometimes. He's burnt down our monastery and he's leaving us to die of hunger, help us. You must tell Baretta to be generous, he will listen to you. Yes Joan, help us. Tell him to give us more food at least! Don't be afraid anymore! I'm here now! I'll take care of you. Eat it up! Well, at last! I can't tell you how glad I am to see you again. Thieves, out-throats, food-pads, and you who once led the king's own army! I've so much to do, I take what I find. Tell me, have you found yourself a man yet? How dare you speak that way to my sister? Oh, I forgot! She hears voices, she speaks to God. I forbid you to speak that way of God! Oh, so your God is too good for me and my kind, is that it? I forbid you to speak that way of God, do you hear? Pay no attention, Joan! You need a lesson in manners, you! There you are! And if you like, I'll take all these ladies, and toss them in the river. I'd do anything for you! She's right! There's got to be a little discipline in an army! I'm glad to see you Joan. Now, important thing first: are you hungry? - No! - What do you moan, 'no'? He's right! Ah, ah! It sounds hollow... Ah! Give them anything they want. - How many men have you got? - More than fifty horsemen, my girl! Thirty-eight crossbowmen sixty archers, two trumpeters and lot of arms. Are you interested? Perhaps. Get up! Get up! I don't want anyone kneeling for me. - So, that's the girl. Ha! Ha! - You know Kennedy, my Scotsman? Isn't it you they call: "He'll come for a sou"? For a penny - it's worth more than a sou! And what are you doing here? That's just it! Come on! Out of here! - Where are we going to? - To Compiegne. And why Compiegne? Because the English want to take Compiegne, and I don't want the English to take Compiegne. All right, I am with you. Compi?gne. With her? Anywhere! When could you leave? When you'll be rested. I'm not in the least tired. Well, as soon as we've loaded up, and come to an agreement. Of course! You remember my price Joan? You've soon my men? Quite an army. It's, yours, if you'll pay four pieces of gold, four sacks of flour, a cow, barrel of wine, each week in advance. Your price is a little higher than last year, Baretta. We had a very bad winter. But then, it's not really important, I haven't any money... But it doesn't matter, you'll be paid at Compiegne! Compiegne... Compiegne... We're a long way from Compiegne. All payments must be made in advance. I see why they call you "He'll come for a sou". I'll come for a sou, if it's paid in advance. And besides, why did the King let you go without money? I no longer have the King's support. Well... Well, well... well! So the King doesn't know you're on your way to fight the English! No, the King is resting. Well! It's not a bad thing to rest a while. That's the way to keep fit. It never does any harm. After all, there's no hurry to start fighting. There's a terrible hurry for me, Baretta! I have no time to waste. God has called me! Baretta! Kennedy! Can't you understand I have no time! Can't you understand I mustn't stop now! One day peace will come to our land, and when it does, you too will leaves us. The soil of my country was not made for the marching feet of soldiers. It cries out for hands to till it, to sow it, to reap the harvests... for life, for peace, for God! That's all very well, but what'll happen to us? You'll fight against the Turks! It's too for! Well then, come to Compiegne! No Joan, find somebody else! You don't believe in me anymore, Baretta, after all we've been through together! But in the old days, you just sprinkled the enemy with holy water, and they ran as fast as they could. - I never done that. Keep your secrets. I have no secrets. And the voices? You did hear voices, if I remember right? - Yes, I still hear them. - Are you quite sure? If you no longer believe in me, it can only mean one thing: it's that you're with the enemy and against God! Listen Joan, I may be able to overlook the payment in advance but at least let me hear your voices for a moment, just to encourage me. Right here, in this room. I'm a good Christian too. Ask them to say something, one word, no more... and I'll go! I don't want you anymore. Don't get upset Joan. For a price, you'd sell yourself to the Devil! If God's no longer on your side, you ought to be thankful for the help of the Devil... That's your affair. There must be money at Compiegne. With a little luck we might manage to reach Compiegne... Her luck has left her, you fool! And that's too bad. We're leaving! She's leaving! No, no. She mustn't! Where are we going now? Everyone goes his own way. All right! I've not changed my mind. I'm going home. Well then, go home! Your future is set. Now that you're a nobleman, you'll get married. And maybe I'll also get married and have children. Don't say that, Joan. Why shouldn't I? There's no need for the Maid of Orleans anymore. Nobody has use for me now. But they have, Joan. No, they don't believe in me. Don't be angry with me, Joan. After all, business is business. What is it you want? I would like you to come and pray with us. My child is dead. He's not buried yet, he'll give us all the plague. You are the plague! Leave her alone. The priest doesn't want to bury him in holy ground. Naturally! The child wasn't baptized! Throw him in a hole, and let's be done with it! If the child wasn't baptized... I know they say he can't go to Heaven, but that can't be right. He never did anything bad. Oh, please, ask God to take him just the same. He'll listen to you. You talk to him often, just as I am talking to you. I know you can - if only you would. No. Then go away! My prayers are no better than yours. They are. No. Then why did you come here? Go away! You wait here, I'll go with her. If your prayers are not answered, it won't matter. We'll have done all we could... but God answers all your prayers! I know very well he doesn't. Why is it always these people who believe in me? Why is it never those I need? Because these are the people who need you. Saint Catherine, Saint Margaret, and you, Saint Michael, you have abandoned me, but hear my prayers once more! I beg you, help this little child to go to Heaven! You must pray too, all of you. I'm not praying for victory, nor for my king, nor for the Kingdom of France. I'm not praying for fame, nor for glory in arms but only for the soul of this little child. If you answer my prayers, nobody will even know. You see, I'm not thinking of myself. But please, take this child to you, so that its mother and all those good people may find it again in Paradise, when their time comes! So be it! You see: her baby wasn't dead! Yes, he was dead I I tell you, he was! The child was dead! No was black all over! He was dead I tell you. Yes, it's true. I know my baby was dead! He wasn't, he wasn't, he wasn't! You weren't dead, were you? He's hungry! Baptize him! Quickly! Water! Quick, quick! Water! Water! Quickly! Water! Water! Water! Quickly! She's brought it back to life! Water! Water! Quickly! Water! Water! She's going to baptize it! She's brought it back to life! It's a miracle! It's a miracle! I saw it, I tell you! A miracle! Joan... What name do you give him? - Charles, as my King! Charles... In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, I baptize thee. Ah... Don't weep! He's in Heaven. Did my hands do that? It was God, through your hands. Joan, my own Joan! You with God, and me with my men, we'll be together always. And what if I said: no? Ah, ah, you are too eager to go to Compiegne to say no! Joan! You've come back! Yes, it's me Catherine. Why did you stop speaking to me? Were you angry with me? We were always with you, Joan. Yes, it's me, Margaret! Even when you didn't speak to me, were you still there? Always Joan. How well I can hear you. Speak to me again. Be strong Joan. Oh I'm very strong now! I'm not afraid anymore! Go into battle, Joan. It's your last one! My last one? Will the English leave afterwards? No, Joan. There will be many more battles, but for you, it will be the last one. Because I'm going to die? No, Joan, because you will be captured before long. When will it be? I'd like to know. Can't you tell me? You will know neither the day nor the hour. At Compiegne? A least, if I'm captured, let me not go to prison. I'd rather be killed straight away. We're ready, Joan. Baretta, give me a sword, a strong one, so that we can really give them a good fight! That's my good old Joan! Here, take mine. Sound the trumpets! Sound the trumpets! Sound the trumpets! I'm telling you: I'll fight! I'll fight again and again, because I prefer to die rather than fall into their hands! Move over, I'm coming with you! I don't need you, I'll got all I want at Compiegne. May the devil burn you inside out, you and that girl! Obviously Joan chose her own destiny, heroic and sublime. At this late date I wish I could claim some small credit for her history, but confidentially all my sympathies were with her enemies at the time.. As for Lysistrata, I wash my hands of the whole affair! And I shudder to think what would happen to the world if women used their secret weapon as effectively in times of peace as these wives of ancient Greece did in war... "Of all the violent passions, the one that becomes a woman best is love." La Rochefoucauld. Silence, Athenians. Let the honourable Cratides Speak. What for? He lies... and when he speaks, the sun darkens. Careful about your imprudent words Lying is un-Athenian. The lie is the secret weapon of Sparta. Let's have less talking around... ...and tell us what happened to General Callias. Has he attacked? Does he go back? Does he advance? We have no news. No news is good news. What do you know about him? He is the most valiant of our general and the most experienced... the most careful... and it is treason to the Republic to doubt the triumph of this great chief. Undoubtedly, at this moment, the General pursues the enemy... and Greece will owe him its salvation... Long live Callias! Long live the war! Pallas protects Athens. Pallas is with us. Pallas is with us. Pallas is with us... For sixty years we have been fighting Sparta... For sixty years we have been defending freedom... against those who want to enslave others. No doubt, that's why we have been defeated... at Tanagra, Dallion... Mantinea, Syracuse and in Egypt. Fool. The defeats you mention are only disguised victories, victories in delay... premeditated defeats by our strategists to confuse the enemy. Don't try to penetrate the secrets of our great chiefs. You think that they retreat, that they fan out...that hey abandon. No. They are taking positions which have been prepared beforehand. Military science is full of contradictions. The deceiving ways of defeat very often lead to final victory. Fool. Callias! Speak Callias. What are you... bringing us. Victory. Valiant Callias, tell us about our victory. My victory is complete. I chased the enemy behind the Corinthian canal. Those who couldn't flee, perished... and those who defiled our sacred soil... are dead. Your are the winner. But, but but do the losers know that they lost? Their dead bodies testify to their defeat. Undoubtedly Sparta will send an ambassador. - What for? - To sign the peace. What peace? What an idea. We won a battle, but not a war. Peace, peace. Right away the big words. Callias had the floor. I came here only to tell you about victory... and to receive the orders of the Athenian people... which, whatever they are, I shall execute. Spoken like a chief. If we really want peace, we must fight... until the last Spartan is dead. No more enemy. No more war. Help... Help.. guards...help me. What's going on? What a job! What is going on, valiant Gorgias? There is no more law and order. The streets is in the hand of the mob... fortunately I fled. How can there be a riot, when the people are at the front? I heard them , I heard... Down with Gorgias, down with the police. To me, they said that. Ah Callias, you are here. You came at the right moment. Well... we must act and fast. General Callias, have this mob dispersed and quickly. Where are they? They are coming... ...this mob of cursed rioters is marching on the assembly. Who leads them? Lysistrata. Peace with Sparta! Our men back home! Our men back home! Our men back home! Our men back home! Our men back home! Our men back home! Our men back home! Our men back home! Our men back home! We want Peace, we want Peace. Peace with Sparta! Peace with Sparta! Circulate. Go! Stop! Zeus... my husband. Lyzi... Lyzi... Stop...Lyzi ,be reasonable... little monster. Oh Callias. Are you mad? My love, alive...you are alive. Let us be grateful for that. Ah...I'll remember this welcome. How could I have known that it was you... I thought you were far away. But I did recognize your horse. Both of you are here. How wonderful! Then it is true... You... You are provoking these riots? When did you return? I am so happy to have you next to me. My love. Do I still please you? Oh, my flower...am I still your honeybee. By Ceres...Will you answer me. What are you doing here. A by Apollo...will you close these lips with a kiss? By Hermes. Silly. Again.. Silly...go on. Now I can breathe again. Tell me...about the war... The Spartans? Beaten. Ah, my sweet darling. I knew from the oracle that it would end thusly... that Athens would be submerged under their superior number. No...What an idea... I have beaten the Spartans. I Callias, I. Why didn't you say so right away. No... you beat them... you... You... Ah... that's real nice. Then... if you won... The war is finished... No... it goes on... Then... you didn't win? Oh... Ah... Yes... but they want me to go on... Where to? I don't know... But wherever it is I shall have to go. And if I didn't let you leave? That's out of the question. The wife of a general, must as he does submit to the exigencies of the State. Ah, then you don't love me anymore. But I love you more than myself. More than war? More than Fame. Your image , Lysistrata, sustains me in the tumult of the battle. Die for Athens... but live for Lysistrata... that is my motto. Within ten or fifteen years the war will be finished... And I my sweet will to 10 or 15 years older... But no! What does it matter. I shall love you as I did the first day. I love you... You'll come to see me sometimes... every two, three years... as today...between two victories. And you'll leave soon after. What a charming life we'll lead. We'll have the recollections of absences... No, no, my sweet... Let me dream on your shoulder... It feels so good to rest there. I could spend the rest of my life this way. When are you leaving? Unquestionably tomorrow... at dawn. Really...We shall have a whole long night together. Yes...tonight the victor of Sparta will be your prisoner. You are my prisoner, my sweet. What does this mean... Will you free me at once, where are you taking me... I'll come back for you as soon as Peace has broken out... By Demeter...I'll punish for your perfidy and your body will remember it. Be good and don't go too far. Lysistrata. With Sparta destroyed and taken, we'll turn to Macedonia... an easy conquest for Athena And for the gods which protect us. As they are Athenians, they say... Down with war, brutes What, what does this mean? We want peace. A conspiracy. A conspiracy. Archers...where are you going. Stay here. Do your duty...arrest them. Ah... you are here. These women are like tigers. This is inadmissible... Are we the masters, yes or no? Who is commanding here? My wife... Get out of here. Come here...out with you. Who commands here? Get home. I said, get home. It's a conspiracy. Might will be with the law. I am the law. One more word and I kill you and serve you to the dogs. Back, you brutes...two legged beasts. I... I... do protest emphatically. Be quiet, ulcer. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Though I am a woman, my tongue is not as idly agile... as that of the professional orators, who generally orate unendingly in this place, for the great misfortune of our city. Woman...vain and superficial creature... do not insult your country. What do you want? I want Peace...idiot. I speak in the name of the women of Athens... We are tired of this stupid war... tired of these defeats and alternating victories. We are sick of heroes and cadavers: enough glory, enough historical events... We want to live in happiness, and love peacefully... we want to have time... to see our husbands and lovers grow old gracefully. We want to bear children and see them grow up and get old we don't want young cadavers That's what me want, not from the gods, but from men... who could be Gods if they only wanted to. We have beaten the enemy. We want an immediate cessation of hostilities. Down with war. Hurray for life. Shame on you. you snake. Shame on you... vile person. Shame on you... madwoman. Shame on you... you... woman. Shame on me... or perhaps because of shame... if you don't give us peace, we'll take it. With what force? Poor woman, go on. Poor man... we have a secret weapon, more powerful and more efficient than any in your arsenals, ...an irresistible weapon... which, incidentally won't cost the city anything. That doesn't exist. The men of Athens won't be intimidated by your your foolish threats... Are you willing to make peace... of your own free will? Never. Hurray for war. Well, the die is cast. Women of Athens, listen carefully. When your husbands or your lovers or both... return to enjoy the pleasure of a short-lived lightning peace... request they ask, or very often they don't even ask... for what you can give them, and only you can give it: the best of you... the best and the worst... The next day, tired, but satisfied they leave for a war from which they might never return... and you find yourself in your lonely home, all deserted. Well, don't lend yourself any more to the enjoyment of the warriors. Refuse them. Resist their entreaties... and refuse them the gift of yourself. By Aphrodite who listens, by Eros who sleeps with one eye open... let us swear solemnly to stay chaste... until Peace is declared. By Aphrodite and by Eros... We swear it. Five hours, all alone ...it was full of red ants... It took me three hours to get free... two hours of acrobatic effort to get out over the roofs. Why didn't you wait for me. You're always in a hurry. I still would be there... I yelled and shouted, but nobody heard me... that's the result... how will I give my orders tomorrow... One two..hmm...forward march. Without voice... a chief loses his authority. What's this. Pigeons are supposed to fly... No ,it's a Spartan pigeon... Let it die. I am sleepy. Tell me, this story... about the... love strike... it's a joke, isn't it? When do you leave? Tomorrow at dawn. These words, they say, you said... you are going to belie them by acts, right? No...Take off your tunic. Ah... I knew... it wasn't true . I'll rub your body with sweet olive oil... Oh...you smell of leather... Onion stew... Horse and massacre... The odour of war, Well, I smell like a general, it's an heroic odour. You tickle me. Ah your weak spot. If Sparta knew it... Why... are you laughing? I am thinking of all these fools who believed that you would deprive us of love. And that's our government! What times! Do you love your general? My general...I didn't marry a general... I married a good looking fellow... In the home...I do not give in to a general... And they would notice that of the two of us the general is not necessarily the best strategist... ...here I am in command... In general... until you fall asleep, exhausted and defeated. Defeated, don't mention that word in front of me. I hate it. No defeat, only victory... or death, Poor girl... If I died...I wouldn't be here to comfort you... Oh, don't worry. I will be courageous, facing your death... Your tomb will be the handsomest in all of Greece... ...I'll see to it that mourners and musicians... ...make of your burial an unforgettable event... Stretch out. Stretch out. I'll perfume your body... I'll see to it that your widow will be the best dressed inconsolable woman... I'll tell my grandchildren all your famous battles... What grandchildren? The children of my eldest son. What eldest son? The general... The one I will have with my second husband... I too will perform to the end the duties of childbearing Athenians citizen. Enough nonsense... let's think about more serious things... and more important to boot, my love. Ah Callias... you are here? You can see that. What do you want? I looked for you everywhere... all over Athens... And I didn't find you... Incredible...what a day. I'll remember... this victory. We feared you were abducted by Spartans. You are here...alive... I am saved... Come with me... Nicephore is waiting for us... Nicephore, Nicephore...I just left him, I saw him at the Prytaneum... Everybody was there... Go away... I have more urgent business to attend to... But listen to me. I want you to leave... Peace... I want to be left in peace. Peace! Just like your wife. Lyzi Lyzi Lyzi Lyzi Lyzi Little monster, you just wait... Chloe. If I went with you... perhaps I could more easily persuade the women of Sparta. You are mad. Don't you know that an Athenian taken on the soil of Sparta risks death? But I risk nothing... I am a Spartan... and all the Spartan women think like we do. When will you go there? At the new, just for the people's assembly... What means...Pericles will be there soon thereafter, if you are successful. I'll send him there soon. Don't stop on the trip... good bye Pericles... see you soon... Pericles... You don't know what it means to live for 34 long nights ... and days without you... Aphrode... answer me...say something to me. Why this bronze curtain between us? You are not a plebeian... This war doesn't concern you... why are you complaining? If my munitions factory closes who is going to offer you bracelets, necklaces, which embellish your body so much, Ahrode? My doe eyed beauty... let 's make an exchange, what I can I give you for you. earrings...a necklace? which. Peace, my sweet. What happened to your foot. Nothing. A door slammed on it. Who did it? Nobody. The wind. Yes, I see, the weather is quite stormy lately... And cloudy. You too Gorgias? Yes I too. Another week like this and I go stark raving mad... Unless one of lend me his hand to sustain me. Gorgias, you are losing your dignity... You might as well suggest that we go to the Courtesans to change our gloomy ideas. To the Courtesans? No, never. Whatever wrongs my wife has committed... I'll not break the sacred vows of marriage... in such infamous places. The courtesans. No no, Lysistrata. The nights are too long, life is too short... and our youth is evanescing fast... I beseech you, in the name of all of us, deliver us of our oath. We can't spend the rest of our life this way... My body may be of marble, but the flesh is weak, and desire pulsates in my veins. You see Lysistrata, I resisted as well as I could. I thought I was strong. Don't tell me that Cratides caresses are what you crave? Who is speaking of Cratides? What greater proof of faithfulness can you give to the loved one... than to reject your husband? My beloved arrived this morning and goes back into battle tomorrow... How cruel must I be to refuse myself to him? Egotist. A soldier without love loses his strength as a warrior. The day heroes will cease to please the ladies, peace will have made a great step forward. Is my love stronger than my will power? The body isn't everything, I'd like to see your face if you woke up someday without your body. And you. How would you look when you hear your beloved has been killed... defending freedom... against some other defender of freedom. I love Callias as much as you love your husbands... but he could throw himself on his knees and I wouldn't give in. Peace first, love after.. Quiet. When one talks about Sparta... Sparta is on our side. Chloe triumphed. Here come the herald of our victory. In Sparta, the men too are deprived. See! The pigeon gives us an example. Pericles has made peace with Sparta too... He started a home there... Hurray for the birds...Hurray for Peace. Illustrious general... courier from Athens. At last. Confidential...secret papers... signed Nicephore... The document is illegible... Yes. just in case it would fall into the enemy's hands, noble hero... but I know the text by heart, son of Apollo. I am listening, messenger. Hero beloved by Zeus. - Good. - Illustrious and indestructible Callias. - Very good. Athens requests immediate attack and brilliant victory... or glorious death for right and freedom of Athens. Thankful country. Me, dying in the war. Me... a general? leave my army without a chief? Never. Continue. Confidential. Civilian male population unable to hold on another 24 hours... Morile critical...situation desperate. They too? What shall we do? Win or die, indestructible immortal. I do not fear battle, or the disorder of attacking chariots, but how can I conduct a battle with an army of lovesick soldiers ? Nicephore waits your answer. Decide my valiant warrior. I will take the answer to Athens myself. You are fleeing the fight, ferocious warrior? On the contrary, you poor benighted idiot. I will engage Lysistrata in hard battle. May you win in this dangerous encounter. You are here...my love My love... Callias. - Lyzi... No, stay. Don't awaken me yet. I am having such a nice dream with all kinds of forbidden happenings in it... Orpheus... My darling ,Orpheus... My Eurydice... I who thought I had lost you... Dream my little one...dream... No. I swore. Oh Callias...what are you doing here.. Why didn't you stay in my dream? A general is not supposed to be in dreams... Before you take me by surprise tell me... are you bringing peace with you, yes or no? I... almost... Yes or no? Listen to me Lysistrata. Peace first, love after.. Your example has demoralized the army and the civilians... This is a crime punishable by death. I give you a chance to repent. One last time, I summon you to cease and desist without further delay this... ...resistance against the men of Athens. - No. I will abide by my oath. Open or I'll break the door down. Lyli! Lyli! Don't stay there...if... if... anybody saw us... They'd see that I keep my oath. Listen Lyzi...don't you love me anymore.. That's just it. I don't want you to die like an idiot...by a lost arrow... My Sweet... I don't risk anything... Oh, my poor darling... Did you hurt yourself? Give me your hand. Oh, that's nothing... The branch gave in... Do the same... - Never. But... Lyzi... Where are you going? But that's ridiculous You see. You got here where I wanted you to be. You will never have a better chance to make peace and yet be covered with glory. History is full of general winning wars. You'd be swallowed by their number. But pacifist generals are few and far between. There aren't any. The place is empty. Occupy it. Declare peace. Look at them. Without love and without women, they plead now every night.. They are waiting for your first misstep and they'll throw you overboard. Be ahead. Time is precious. Go, quickly. Don't lose this unique chance my foolish darling. Silence! Athenians... Before sacrificing to war the elite of the city... your general wants to take his responsibilities... by letting you face them courageously. You know what these responsibilities are... So I won't belabour the point... Let's not play the enemy's game... in winning a victory which serves only to aggrandize the loser. Believe my word. The superior interest of the state... oblige us to make an unforeseen peace brutally... with an enemy... ...fully unconscious... and thus to demonstrate to the world that Athens can afford to one victory less... Yours is the choice. Your destiny must be decided by you. The conquerors of Marathon. Salamina... and Prati... are not afraid of a premature peace... I suggest therefore that an ambassador be sent... Callias! and let the cowards opposed to this , speak up. Can't you watch where you are going, Idiot? Are you blind? Your eyes are stuck together with honey? By Zeus, you are a Spartan. What are you doing here? Whether you like it or not, I came to propose a peace. Where is the assembly meeting? Right ahead and then left. Ah, women! You state it very well. And thus peace began in all of Greece... Bringing with it, joy... ...work... ...love... ...abundance... ...fertility... My poor darling, the war is over... ...the promise of better times to come. You are happy? You have it now...your peace. But I... what will I do now? Oh, my darling... as all ex-generals... ...you'll go into Politics.
