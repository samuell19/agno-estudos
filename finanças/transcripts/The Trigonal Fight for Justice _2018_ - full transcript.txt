Are you ready, yet? Are you ready? - Fight! - Are you ready? - Fight, fight, fight! - Fight! Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight! - Cheers, cheers! - Cheers! Do you want to move to champagne? - Yes, do you have that? - Can I have? Yeah, okay. There you go. Thank you. Yeah, I got this, go. Another year, another gold. What's next for you, Jacob? Hmm, we'll see. It's got to be bigger, got to be better. What else could be bigger and better than that? What are you chasing? Seriously? The game, it's always evolving. Somewhere in the world there's always something to beat. Two years ago, when you moved back from the States with your wife, I really thought you were going to hang up the gloves and retire, but two years later - and five championship tournaments-- - I love fighting. I love the feeling. I love the feeling of being in there, man to man, testing your limits, going above and beyond of what you think your body can endure. Pow! Boom! You score that winning punch, KO. It's addicting. It's a bad-ass feeling, That's why it's so hard to stop! What's hard to stop? Loving you, that's what's so hard to stop. - Were you trying to stop? - Hell no. Even if he tried, Annie. Ah! You going to drink? Ugh, no, I can't. Open. No. - No? - It's cold. No, I can't - You sure? - Yeah, take them both. We're celebrating anyway. Oh, should I be doing this now? Jacob, Jake! - You're so corny. - No? No. Corny, how about, how about this? How about, how about this? - I like that. - Hey, you like that, yeah? - What do we call this dance? - This is, um, this is, you should do it, here. - Okay. - You should do it. This is, uh, this is the, the Mama dance! You're liking the Mama dance? - I do like it. - You like... I do like the Mama dance. Yeah. You like the Mama dance? Yeah? - You want to-- - Shh. Hmm? Did you just say the Mama dance? Yeah. You... Then... - And we-- - You, you should be doing the Daddy dance. Yeah. You're going to be a mom? Mm-hmm. I'm going to be a dad? I'm going to be a dad. Oh, my god. Okay. So? What do you think? You finished the crib. I'm impressed. Well, when I retire from this karate thing, I'm going to need something to take up. So how about I take up baby carpentry? Ah, you're so funny. You are a funny guy. Mm. Everything all right? You feeling okay? We can still do it, right? Jacob, I going to be serious here. I really think you should stop fighting, already. Baby, do we have to talk about this right now? I mean it. When you wanted to move back here, and I followed you from the States, - I thought we were going to start something new. - But we are. I thought we got something good going on here. Do we? We have a business that is teetering from past due bills. We're in debt. - We haven't even recovered our initial investment, yet. - That's why I fight, right? To boost the cash flow, to boost the reputation of the dojo, to achieve our goals. Annie, we have so much more to achieve. Like what? What else is there to fight for? You have the dojo. You have your students. You have me. Soon, you'll have a baby. Annie, I thought we've talked about this already. What? - Hey, Mei! - Hello, suckers! How are you? Hey, I got to go see my pops. Eh? One, two, three, go! One, two, three, go! Today, we're warming up with some basic drills. - Sir Niño, fighting stance. - One, two, three, go! One, two, three, go! - One, two, three, go! - Find your partner, face each other, bow. Jacob. Someone's here. Niño, finish the front kick reverse punch then the side kick and then just take over, all right? I'll be back. Gentlemen, what can I do for you? Our boss asked us to make sure that we deliver an invitation personally. What kind of invitation? This is Annie, my wife, better half. Annie. Allen, Hank Allen. Well, let's cut to the chase. Our boss is holding a very special fighting event. Did you sign up for something? Hmm? No, no idea who these guys are, baby. You've heard of the Trigonal, right? - Yeah, that's a myth. - Well, it exists. And I'm handing you a personal invitation to try out for it, straight from the boss. - Who's your boss? - Are you kidding me? What the hell? Baby, they just came over here to give me an invitation. No, it's not even a discussion. We're not interested. Thank you, but no. Please leave. Are you kidding me? You heard the boss. There's the door, brother. It's time to go. One, two, three, go! Hi-yah! Exactly. Exactly. Okay, see you. My gladiators, I remember, a long time ago, I was just like him, young, ferocious, fighting machine. This was my world. Nothing else mattered but the fight. Sit down, gentlemen. So you got him in. I found him, and I invited him to join the competition, like you said boss. But, uh-- But what? But he's not coming. Technically, his wife got in the middle and stopped him from even thinking about it. - And you did nothing. - Yeah. No, I mean I just gave him the invitation as you ordered. You're a fucking moron. I give you an easy fucking job, and you fucking blew it. Well, he didn't want to come, and I didn't want to create a big scene. - Get the fuck off the island. - What? Oh, you're deaf now as well? Get the, get this guy off my island, before I have him-- Boss! Go back to the mainland, take a chill pill. You're off the pay until I decide to get all charitable and shit. Boss. Get the fuck out of here, mate! Motherfucker, no, no, no. You look good. James, how's your training? Ah, it's all good, sir. Be much better if I get some of that Buddha Gold in me. In due time, champ, in due time. This next version we're working on is going to blow you away, guaranteed. - You'll be punching holes into people's heads, like pancakes. - That sounds great. Get your kidneys checked out, tomorrow. - Make sure that the doctor clears you first. - Will do, boss. My clients from around the world will be coming in a month's time for the showcase, and I need to put on a really good show for them. - So you stay clean and ready to fight, okay? - Sure thing. Okay, get the fuck out of here. By the way, who's this guy, Mr. Jacob Casa? What's his fucking deal? He's a local martial arts hero. Everybody thinks he's indestructible. But you, my man, will destroy their little hero. Yes, I will. Feed the lion. No plans yet. Oh, really? So, let's take a five-minute break. When we come back, we're going to find a partner, - and we're going to work on that drill, all right? - Yes, sir! All right, one, two, three! Osu! Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, um, this girl, a while ago, gave me a card. And I'm not sure what I should do with it. - Should I give it to him or-- - No, no, no. What are you guys talking about? Sensei, I, uh, we were just talking about-- Yo, just give the card, man. Good evening, sir. Want something to drink, sir? Water? Hello, Jacob. So the prize money was how much? One thousand US dollars, just to fight one bout. What's the catch? Everything is a catch. ¶ Can't seem to control My thoughts ¶ There's one thing you can do with this little burner. Type 666 and send. How do I know this is for real? Just because I think you're kind of cute, I'm going to show you a piece of action. ¶ Meant to see you ¶ Boys. What are you doing here? Peace, brother, peace. Yeah, rest in peace. Get back! One more! Arnel, you hit like a nanny! Now he's dead. And that is how you do it. - There. - Thank you. What makes you think that I'm going to take this fight? You want to know more, don't you? - Maybe. - This is just a qualifying event, baby. You make it through this, just one little bout, you get to fight at the Trigonal, the big one. One million dollar cash, the winner takes all. - The Trigonal? - Yes, and Henry Tan sent his personal invitation. Henry Tan, that ex-fighter turned steroid-making drug dealer. Not just steroids, baby, something much, much better, much, much more powerful. Dodoy? What the hell? Everyone get out! I am calling my husband. Look what we have here, the lady champ of Casa Dojo! - Come on! - Come on, Jacob. - Call your daddy! - Answer. Call your daddy! We are looking for him, anyway. I know! But we have something better! Yo, chiquita! So what would you do with one million dollars? Shit. That would set me and my family up for life. You don't strike me as a married man. In fact, me and my wife, we were, um, expecting, oh, shit, excuse me. What's wrong, baby, forgot the wifey over the hottie? Shit, shit. Shh! I'm not going to hurt you. Listen, um, I got to go. - Wait! - What is it? - I got to go. - Take the phone! Fuck it! Hang on. Yes? That's good. He took the phone? That means he'll call. One million dollars is a dream come true. One million dollars, he thinks he's going to make one million dollars. Ha! Officer, officer, no, this is my dojo! My wife's in there! Officer, please let me through. Annie. Annie! Hey, hey, Wait, wait, wait! - That's my fucking wife! - Stop! Wait, wait, wait. Hey, hey, hey. Shh, just calm down. - No, Annie! - Hey, hey, hey, hey, listen to me! - Calm down! - Who fucking did this? Look, we don't know yet, but you calm the fuck down. You have to be strong for her. You get that? Come on, let's go. Come on, come on, come on. Is that him? - That's him. - How's he doing? Not so good. Mr. Casa? I'm Detective Tony Pascual, Bacolod PD. Dr. A. Richards, station four. Dr. A. Richards, station four. My team got a call, and this is what they found when they arrived. Do you have any idea who might do this? Any known enemies? Who the fuck did this to my family, Detective? Listen, it's for us to find out and for you to accept. For now, you need to lay low and relax. If you need anything, call me. My number's there. You look like shit. You should go home, take a shower, freshen up. Allison to station two. Sir! Are you related to the female patient? Huh? Yes, Doc, I'm the husband. How is she doing? Her condition is unstable, and she's in a coma. We have to monitor her vital signs around the clock. She may also have been a victim of a sexual assault. We're checking for internal bleeding, and when the results come out, we will decide if we will do surgery. I don't know if you know, but your friend Dodoy, he didn't make it, I'm sorry. Doctor, what about the baby? Did the baby make it? Please tell me my baby's okay. - I'm sorry. She lost the baby. - You're sorry? Now straight and tight. A little technique. Now shoot, get ready to tackle me and the knee. - That was pretty cool. - Is it pretty cool? That was pretty cool. What's this? I'm giving you this medal as a promise, a promise to you that I'm not going anywhere. I will always be by your side, and I'm willing to do anything for you. Fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck you! Fuckin' fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck! I can't guarantee you anything, Mr. Casa, but if we will do the surgery, there's a chance, no matter how small. Do it. Save my wife, please, save my Annie. Baby, I'm so sorry I have to do this. I'll be right here when you wake, okay? Ah! - Come on, bitch! - Ah! Ah! Let's go! Welcome to Bacolod's Underground Fight Club, Jacob. Come on! Yeah! Come on! Oi! They call it the Green Dragon, good stuff, you see? Come on. Ah. There he is! There he is, Jacob Casa! Congratulations, champ! You surprised everyone tonight! First time anyone's ever beaten one of Henry Tan's favorites. You the man! You are the man! You're going to hear from Mr. Henry Tan, real soon, real soon, ha! That was amazing. Oh, you guys all suck. You haven't seen anything yet. Come on. Wah! Waiter! Arnel, here's to you. May you get a brand new set of balls. Allen! She was fine. I haven't had that kind of pussy in years. And I got myself a medal from that karate bitch, for all the trouble. I got myself a fuckin' medal! Get down! Hey, biatch! Shit. You die as a common thug and a failure. Are you okay? Mei, let's go, Mei! The police are coming! Come on, come on. - What about him? - Just take him, come on! Stand up, come on. Hmm. Good morning. - Where the hell am I, China? - No, you're still in Bacolod. This is the Taoist temple. I've heard of this place. I've just never been inside. Mm. I'm Mei Li. That was my father Master Li. I'm Jacob, Jacob Casa. We know who you are. We saw you at the bar last night. You were mauled and shot. Frankly, I'm surprised you're even up. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! I, I need to make a phone call. Do you have my cell phone? Uh, you didn't bring one. Well, we didn't find one. But I don't know if that'd be a good idea, because you may have killed some people last night. Well, I killed some people last night. You? Really? You don't sound Chinese. Well, I was born in Beijing, but my family moved to San Francisco when I was ten years old. My father came to Bacolod to open business with his cousins, and, uh, this is his wushu school. And I came here about a week ago, for a short visit. And thanks to you, I guess I'm staying longer. Oh, shit, sorry. Thank you for saving my life. Maybe one of these days, I could return the favor. I believe this is yours. Allen, that son of a bitch! I should never have hired him in the first place! Fuckin' troublemaker! Now he's dead from his own stupidity, and he might possibly lead a trail to us. I'll make sure it doesn't happen, sir. Tell all our people. Put everyone on alert. Any sign of authorities sniffing around, we go underground. And the Trigonal, still on? We'll see. We have to mitigate our risks. It's a groundbreaking event, can't afford to screw it up. We're releasing the best product ever, got to make sure that we provide the best possible showcase for the Buddha Gold. I'll make sure to double security, sir. It's not a problem. And the Trigonal opponent lineup, all set, right? Still waiting on confirmation from one of the fighters, Jacob Casa. What? Where is he? I don't know, sir, but we're looking for him. Well, find him, goddammit! Yes, sir. Fuck. Jacob Casa. He worries me. Hmm. Chill out, Jake. I'm not here to arrest you. Then what the hell are you doing here? Did you get into another fight? Car accident. Huh. Well, you know, it pisses me off that you never call or text anymore. I never have. Well, you should. Well, my phone's broken. Oh, so I guess this isn't yours? Man, there's a lot of pictures in here that shouldn't be left in the phone. You're an asshole. You went through my phone? Oh, now it's yours? Just give it back. Or what? You're going to MMA my ass? Is that before or after I 9mm yours? God, you're such a fucking asshole, dude. Here. You have no idea what kind of storm's coming. Do you? What are you talking about? Well, you know, you can come with me, and we talk, yeah? As you can see, I'm kind of busy, right? Not right now. Sorry, but I got a badge and a gun. Oh, I got two actually. And you're on the run. So I think now is the right time to talk. Listen, Detective, I've been just trying to figure this out myself, all right. I mean, there's a couple of people that might have gotten into trouble along with-- That man is responsible for everything you're going through. He's untouchable, rich as fuck and lives like a ghost. It all started with that invitation. Huh, so now you're in kind of deep, aren't you? What do you want me to do? Yo, I'm busy. What? Goddammit! Ah. - Oh! - Am I bothering? Mr. Jacob, please come in. Whoa, you're like a hacker or something! Just some old toys I had here before I went to MIT. Seriously, MIT? Yep, EECS. Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, huh? What? I'm a girl? I can't be an electronics engineer? Is that only for boys? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm, wow! It's actually incredible. This is all incredible. What are you working on? Bugs and flies. Bugs and flies? You know, like, insects. Okay, so I will just stick to karate then. Well, anyway, dinner's ready, if you're hungry. Uh, okay, I'll be there in a minute. All right, bugs and flies. So what do we have here today? It's called La Paz Batchoy. Annie taught me how to make it. I hope you guys like it. Mm, good stuff. He says he likes it. - Thank you, Master. - Ah. I'm glad you do like it. Not bad, not bad at all. Thank you. You should stick to karate. What? Karate's all I ever knew. I dedicated my life to the craft, of course, until I met Annie, and then that's when everything changed. I opened up my own dojo. We were expecting our first child, and, and now, it's just a bad dream, a nightmare. You know, some people call me Kung Fu Panda. I mean, is it 'cause, like, I'm, like, Chinese? I do, like, kung fu? Like, what is that? Do I look like a panda? Listen, Mei, I need to talk to you about something really important. Okay, go ahead. I'm going to be working with the police, to take down the Trigonal and Henry Tan. Henry Tan? He's one of the biggest innovators of illegal drugs in the world. Boss, I think we're just in time. Good, Doc, how many this time? Give or take, around 300 kilos, so far. That's a little short, don't you think? Don't worry, boss, we have time. Doc, we need it early. You should know that. Hmm, so like Shabu? No, his drugs make Shabu and crystal meth look like Tylenol. I've seen it. It gives these regular humans this superhuman strength. Pretty little things, aren't they? Okay. Okay, okay. - So the fighters at the Trignal are under this drug? - Trigonal, yeah, it... I barely survived the qualifying rounds last month. - Well, well, where is it? - No one knows when and where, but authorities feel that, since they've seen Henry Tan in the vicinity of Bacolod, that he'll be organizing the next Trigonal over here next month. Wait. Oh, my god! That's so cool! So are you saying you're going to infiltrate this Trig, Trigonal? And then you're going to, like,, take it down, like, with the police? That's the plan. Dude, you're like Jason Bourne! No, you're like John Wick, - but with more hair! - Mei, chill out. - Dude, you got to take me with you. - Are you listening to yourself? This is a major drug bust, and I'm using myself as the bait. Dude, that's so freakin' cool! - You're crazy. - Well, you got to take me with you! - No! - Yes! No! - Well, I'm going to rat on you. - No, you won't. Try me. Mei, I don't need you getting hurt. I don't get to stay home, while you go do exciting things. Mei, fighters under the influence of this new drug, they, they have this, a weakness. So, what is, what is this drug called? New drug. Okay, go on, new drug. Fighters under the influence of this new drug, apparently, they have a weakness. It weakens their kidneys. So a solid blow to the kidneys can slow these fighters down, almost incapacitate them, an energy, a force, strong enough to penetrate the tissue deep enough to reach the kidneys. So, like, penetrating energy? Is there such a thing? Jacob, Jacob Casa? Osu. I haven't seen you in years. It's really good to see you, sir. - Sir, this is Mei. - She's, uh, my training partner. - Oh. - She's helping me integrate kung fu into my fighting style. Nice to meet you, Mei. Come in, come in. So, how've you been? Sensei, I, um, I know you're retired from this fight game, but, uh, I need your help. I'm a simple farmer now. My backyard is an excellent organic farm. Isn't that great? Oh, it's excellent, Sensei, - excellent. - You know what? Hang on, I'll get you guys some drinks. Oh, okay, thank you. You know what saddens me is the death of Dodoy, but I'm more concerned about your wife, Annie. How's her condition, right now? She's in good hands. I trust she'll be all right, but for now, I have a very important job to do, over here. - Get some. - Sensei, uh, Bacolod's going to be hosting the next Trigonal. You know what that means. Criminals, drug lords, they'll be all over this town. I plan on working with the police, infiltrate the event as a fighter, set up a drug bust. When did you start playing cop? When they decided to mess with my family, mess with this community. So you're fighting the Trigonal, and you want me to train you. I don't know, Jacob. The fight game has changed. It has evolved. Do you really need this? Sensei, yes. No one's ever seen it before, in modern combat. Penetrating energy, no one knows about that. I can use it. My opponent will never anticipate that, let alone try and block it. Okay, tomorrow, 5 a.m. Do you remember the old gym? Oh, yes, sir. Don't be a millisecond late. Tapado. Tapado uses a Filipino long stick with maximum power in every blow. Modified Tapado uses the same principles but without a weapon, penetrating energy. A strike so powerful and so dynamic, there's no way it can be stopped. Every strike, when unleashed, is powerfully sincere. If you escape the downward strike, you have the ricocheting force to contend with. The head, block! Slide to the head, okay? Block, slide to the head. Your turn. One, slide, good. Two, good. Attack with a series of intentions. It's like a game of pool. Strike down, up, to my face. Good, up here. Every shot sets up the next. Osu! Oi. - Yes, Mei? - Sensei Mike, you know Jacob's going to need more than just your fighting skills to win this fight, right? You know I'm retired. And I'm out of the game. I know, but I'm just saying that sometimes you got to break the rhythm. You're wise beyond your years. Hello. Jacob Casa. Yeah. Who's this? This is Henry Tan. I know you've been expecting my call, so here I am, calling you. Listen, Jacob, I'll be direct. You're in for the fight of your life with a whopping one million dollars prize money if you win. I've made a lot of fighters rich through the Trigonal. One fight, just one, and you can retire for good. What do you say we bury the hatchet? Me, you, working together? Where and when? That's more like it. I knew you were bigger than your emotions, - a true champ-- - Cut the bullshit. Where and when? Tsk, tsk, tsk, okay, so much for the small talk. Saturday, 4 p.m., Laxon Street in front of the old school building. My men will pick you up. Okay? I'm taking a corner man with me. You can bring one, just one. Come sterile, no training gear, no weapons, no electronics. Motherfucker! It's done. Oh, you fuckin'... Long time, no see, primo. Hey, mate, how are you? - Hey, what's up, man? - Yo, man. - Oh, fuck, how's training? - Fuckin' good, man. - Yeah, training hard? - Yeah. Good. I just got partnered with this guy Jacob Casa from Bacolod. I'm going to fuckin' smash him. He's got long hair like a girl. I'm just worried the crowd's going to tease me for wife bashin', you know? - They're going to think I'm a fuckin' girl-basher. - Nah, fuck him. You'll fuckin' kill him, man. Just make sure you train hard, and double your dose of the pills, 'cause fuckin' the spinnin' kick just did my kidney again. Just fuckin' train hard, boys, all right? - Right. - Okay. All right, be prepared, huh? All right. Are they here yet? Are they here yet? Are they here yet? - Mei. - Are they here yet? - Mei, can you just-- - Are they here yet? For one second, just one second-- Oh, they're here. You think? Sorry, it's a habit. - Cellphone? - I didn't bring one. Unlike doofus over here, I follow instructions. Why do you have fortune cookie? I'm Chinese. Isn't that what we do? Go ahead. Open it up. Ya sniff it, ya eat it. Come on. Let's see your fortune. Today, you will go on a special trip. Check that out, fortune told, baby. Put it back. - Ah Qiang, ni hao. - Hi, boss. Whoa. Have you seen Fight Club? This is not a movie, Mei. Dude, you're like Edward Norton. Does that mean you're, like, fighting yourself? You're so weird. Ah, Jacob Casa, finally, we meet. Relax. It's going to be an exciting night. I can't wait for your outstanding performance. I'm not here to perform for you. Of course not. Don't think of it that way. You fight for whatever cause you desire. In the end, you fight for whatever cause I designed. - You know, you should really have popcorn here. - Who's this feisty, young one? I think it's time for you to leave now. I'm getting ready to shut you down, tonight. Shut me down? Oh, Jacob, dreams get you nowhere. You should first focus on staying alive. Forget about them. Ladies and barbarians... ...the moment of truth is here! Time to embrace risk, danger, adventure for wealth, power and glory! Fights will be held here in this triangular stage we call the Trigonal! Each match will consist of two rounds, five minutes in the first round. There will be no, I repeat, there will be no time limit in the second round.

Finish him! Ah Qiang, go for his kidneys, Ah Qiang! Ah Qiang, the kidneys! Tell him to go for the kidneys, the kidneys! You lost, come on! What the fuck? What the fuck? - What the fuck is going on? - It's an accident, sir. I don't know what's happening. I'm about to move millions of dollars in Buddha Gold tonight. But this, this is going to stop everything. If we can't show our customers that the product works 100 %, we're fucked! It's not over yet, sir. You bet your ass it's not. You're going to fight Jacob Casa next, and you're going to kill the motherfucker, and then you're going to fight the Mongolian, and you're going to kill him, too. - Is that clear? - Consider it done, sir. You better or you will be done. Give me the vial. Double your dose! I don't give a fuck what it takes, double it! Here we go again!

Jacob! Stop! Ah! What the hell is this? Motherfucker, he was so strong. - Okay, Jacob. - What? You're totally winning. I can feel it. You're winning! You mean, it seriously looks like I'm winning? Have you seen Rocky? Mei, Rocky loses. Well, what about Rocky II? Mei, just shut up and help me. Sorry. Give me more drugs. Give me the fucking drugs. This should help. This is it! The moment we've all been waiting for, the final round! Unarmed fighting with no rules and no time limit! Are you ready? Are you ready? Fight! Oh, beautiful!
