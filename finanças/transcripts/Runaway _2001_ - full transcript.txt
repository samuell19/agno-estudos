Why are you crying? Is it because your sister-in-law is coming to take you back? Don't you want to go home? - I just don't want to be with them - Why not? What's wrong with them? This is a temporary place. We're only here to sort out the girls' problems I know it's difficult to put up with restrictions at home... ..but if you're a sensible girl, you'll get on with your family - Nobody could get on with my family - Everybody says that I know, I met your mum - perhaps I couldn't get on with her either but what's the alternative? Running away? Watting for strangers to help you out? Nobody can help you better than your own family It's alright for you, you don't have to stay at home all day You're free to do what you like, you can't understand us Why don't you sit down? You won't solve anything by running away Where would you go? Look, all men are wolves What do you think they're after with a pretty young girl like you? Your mother's only strict with you because she cares Damn her and her caring She doesn't want you to be ruined in this society Women like her just get pregnant, they don't care about the children They should be ashamed! Monireh, I miss my mum so much I don't know why I keep telling everyone that I miss my mum I don't think she loves me How can a mother not love her daughter? It happens I've never heard of such a thing I can't wait to see my mum, I keep thinking of her... I'm always thinking of her and of my brother I had a dream... I don't remember when, last night or the night before... I dreamt that the devil came... ...and said that my mum was dead and my brother was dead I cried so much... it was the middle of the night - Are you going to stay here? - I don't know I don't want to stay here and I don't want to go home Where do you want to go? On tothe streets? I tell you, you won't find anywhere better than here I think it's like heaven Much better than home No beating, no cursing... It's so much better... in so many ways - What's your name? - Maryam Cat got your tongue? Did it get your tongue? Aren't you going to say hello? - Where have you come from? - Doroud Doroud? Where's that? Do you know where it is? One hundred and... wait... -..and two stations from Tehran - Two stations? No, one hundred and two How do you know it's 102 stations? The train stopped so many times Tell me why you came to Tehran My brother hurts me... he beats me, so I ran away from home When you ran away, didn't you worry that something might happen to you? - How old are you? -12 Don't you want to go home? - No, I don't! - Why not? My brother hurts me What if he promises not to hurt you? How does he beat you? We have a big cable and he beats me with it Acable? Where? All over my body If anyone hit you with such a cable... ...you'd have to stay in bed for three days and nights I see, you wouldn't, but I would! If he doesn't hurt me, I'l go back, but if he beats me, I won't If he beats you, you won't - Can I gonow? - Yes, goon Have you got parents? At least Maryam has a father... I don't You're more normal than me They only think you're crazy because you keep running away They say I have to goto hospital... ...sothey can find out what's wrong with me Sometimes I lose control It's my nerves, you see I've seen lots of psychologists because I lose control None of them can say what's wrong with me I'm going to see a new one I'l see what he says - Do you get bored at home? - Yes, terribly They won't let me go out because I've run away so many times - How many times? - Maybe 20 or 30 times Don't I have any rights in life? I want to wear a short coat, I can't They decide exactly what I'm to wear No high heels, no short coat, no tight trousers, no short scarf That's what they're like They decide what I can do, what I can't do: eat this food, don't eat that, put on these clothes, not those At my age, I resent being constantly criticized I don't mind them criticizing me... ...but they shouldn't interfere with everything I do I want to live apart from them for a while But I have nowhere to go I love them very much I really don't know why I keep running away Was that the only reason? He beat me up What with? With a cable, a belt, a stick... With a knife - look! You can see the mark Here's another one These are all knife cuts If you had been hit with that cable... ...you'd be in bed for three days - Know what I mean? - Yes... - Did you go to school? -No - Have you ever been to school? - No. I haven't got an ID card She had a fever last night Did you tell Ms Farbod? She gave her something for the fever The girls were looking after her In the middle of the night, a big man came into my room There was nothing I could do I'm an 18-year-old girl, how could I fight a strong man? He did it to me several times When I came out, I saw my father sitting in the comer He was smoking and he was drunk - He showed no reaction? -No After this your life fell apart? My father hit me in the face, I'l never forget it Why? He said that if I loved him I'd put up with it - my mother and sister had to Your father encouraged you? My father was so into drugs He'd shake my bag to see if there was any money in it He didn't care about me, his own daughter I used to tell myself "This is my father... "I have to rely on him... "He can help me" But he didn't... instead he forced me into a life of misery and darkness Day and night I suffered hunger, thirst... No clothes, no place to stay... I had to put up with all this I had to take all these insults... People treated me like dirt Because of my father, I became an outcast I suffered so much Now I'm here... Yes, she'll be staying here Il contact her mum and ask her to come... Sorry about that So you ended up on the streets What did you do then? I had nowhere to sleep I had to be with a different man each night I felt more and more desperate Once I decided to kill myself That night my dead mother came to me in a dream I said "Mum, I've had enough, I'l come to you tomorrow" My mum got upset. She said "Why now? It's not right "ll come for you when it's time" She gave me two pomegranates... Two pomegranates in a pretty blue wrapping woke up ... ..and I knew my mother loved me. She was the love of my life I've come to tell you I've had enough of being here - You want me to send you home? - Yes I can't stand Elnaz I told you living here would be like this, didn't 1? Wherever you go, there'll be kids like Elnaz There are bullies everywhere Wherever I go with Elnaz, even if it's just as far as the door... ...she never says anything sensible, she talks rubbish to me When we were in the mosque, she said: "you can't come with us tomorrow, you don't know how to pray properly" This happens everywhere with kids My brother beats me, but he doesn't say the things Elnaz says to me She shamed me in front of everybody at the mosque You'd rather put up with your brother I can't stand Elnaz. I don't care if my brother beats me If you could put up with your brother why did you run away? Have you learned your lesson now? There's no place like home Look at me If it's not Elnaz, it'll be someone else teasing you Next time, I'l thump her 'l'talk to Elnaz, but you must lear to put up with these things If she annoys me again, Il break her jaw I'tell her to leave you alone, but you leave her alone too, alright? I didn't do anything! I was sitting in the mosque by myself, praying... ...and she pulls my chador from behind as if she owns me I'm older than all of you, but I still treat you with respect This is a basic rule of life If anyone wants to -- Don't interrupt me! I won't have any answering back in this meeting When you fight... When you use bad language... When you threaten one another... ...you are breaking the rules You came here because you can't live at home with your families If you want to live here, you have to respect the house rules Agirl must behave properly, be decent and modest Elnaz, do the call to prayer Turn that music off, go upstairs and say your prayers Then lunch I never went out, I was always at home I could have been like other girls and gone out with men, but I didn't I'd talk to my parents' photographs, like a mad person I talked to the photos and cried Nobody paid any attention to me. I kept everything to myself When I tried to talk to my father... ..he pulled my hair and threatened me with a knife He burned my skin with cigarettes I couldn't stand it I knew that if I stayed there, I'd end up on the streets It's the first time I've run away The lady who took me in, Mrs Yadegari, was so kind tome I haven't seen my mum for six years I haven't talked to anyone else Would you like to see the lady who took you in? - Yes, I would - Good I've got her phone number I'd like to call her Please, I'm not like other girls I did nothing wrong If I'd wanted to, I could have, these past six years I've got a virginity certificate You can ask Mrs Yadegari We don't doubt your virginity or what you've told us We can't decide what to do on the basis of this session We must make sure that she's telling us the truth She says she has no address, no home phone number Kids often resist letting someone into their world Some do it by putting on a tough front... ..or by being aggressive with us Others, like her, doit by being gentle and mild... almost normal She wants me to believe her She was trying to convince me She thinks I believed what she was telling me about her situation But her emotional state does not match the story she's telling me My situation's different I was on the streets longer I had to put up with a lot And I didn't? Yes, you did, but my situation is different from yours... ...s0if I ran away again I'd know how to survive in a society full of wolves But for you, it was the first time, you've been out there for only a week Setareh, aren't you going to pray? I can't today, I've got a religious excuse - Have you prayed? - I'm about to - Then go on, don't be late - My ear's itching! You'll get more good points for being on time, hurry up! - You can make it - But I hate studying Look, the sun is shining... our future is going to be like this tl be as bright as that, if we really want it I'm sure of it. So from now on you must change your life I've lost all hope It's winter now, right? We're alsoin the winter of our lives Listen, it will pass and then spring will come It's going to be green everywhere - We're stuck here, what's the use? - No, you can make your own spring After spring comes the warm summer It's the best time of your life - I can't think like you - Why not? You're only 18, in three years you'll be like me When I was your age, I didn't think like that either But now I have so many dreams But I can't think like you Why? Tell me what's on your mind You can tell me, I'm your best friend now I want to get out of here... I hate myself But why? I don't know Come on Let's keep our shoes on! I feel that Parisa is like me I don't want her to repeat my mistakes... ...go through the horrible things I went through It's as if my other half is sitting here My life is being repeated I want to be like a dam, to stop it... ...50 she won't end up like me I don't want her to waste the best years of her life like I did That's why I'm kind to her I try to fill the void inside me and inside Parisa too The only thing that makes me happy is helping Parisa and girls like her Later, when she's my age, she can be proud of herself... She'll be happy with her life... ...and say that she once knew a girl called Setareh... ..who said things to her that changed the course of her life It's very important to me that people think well of me I'm always waiting for my mum I don't know how to reach her My dad was very nasty to her... ...even in front of me My father was always angry They'd be joking and suddenly he'd tum vidlent... ...and throw at my mum whatever he could grab: cups, glasses, the teapot... ...anything he could get his hands on My mum used to lock herself in the toilet She would stay there for an hour or two I don't know what I'm going to do If it goes into the net, it's not a goal! Now you try! You lost, mate, you lost! I lied to the counsellors, to everyone I've got parents, two sisters and two brothers I ran away because my father humiliated me in front of everyone He said bad things about my fiancé's family He used to treat me differently from my sisters... ...and bad-mouthed my fiancé The day I got my exam results, I saw I'd failed again in three subjects: Maths, English and Psychology I knew when I got home, my father would say: "I spent all that money, I got you a private tutor and you failed again!" I knew he'd beat me, lock me up I knew I'd be humiliated again in front of my fiancé and his family That's why I was scared When I ran away I went straight to the police What I said about my life was all lies I knew if I told the truth they'd send me home I was sent to Social Services and then to the Medical Police I was examined there and they found I was a virgin The first day I spent here, I was shy of the other girls... ..but after 10 minutes, we became friends, we got really close On my first night I had nightmares... ...and she gave me a lot of courage I can't bear to leave her, I don't think I can I love her somuch I love you too, I won't forget you Don't cry, please, don't Last night we cried a lot together We talked a lot I told her that life is full of difficulties... ...and sometimes one gets to a point where one has to run away... ...from oneself, from one's life I'm not upset about her lying to me. She must have had a good reason I told her she'd learn from experience but she must not do it again I ran away because of my dad's temper My dad is respected by everybody By running away I've ruined his reputation Do you feel better now you've told the truth? I feel lighter, but I'm scared Tell my father that I'm intact, that I wasn't on the streets a single night He's very sensitive about these things Tell him I was here You must try to gain their trust and show them that you're a good girl Tell them you made a mistake and now you want to make up for it But they'll look down on me now, won't they? No, they won't, parents are kind, they're forgiving Often, they're not as bad as children think I want to be happy and I want you to be happy too Thank you, God is great Take care of yourself Your happiness will be mine Do you understand? Be happy There, now go to your husband Your uncle and your father are waiting Show them your feelings for them They admit they were also at fault but you too acted a bit immaturely There's no mistake that can't be forgiven I saw your father, he's not such a bad father At least he admits he made mistakes too - Won't he hit me? - No, don't worry! Come on, Parisa. I'l come too, don't be scared I'm going to be there with you There's nothing to worry about Here comes your lovely daughter Please sit down Parisa will tell you what she has to say God willing, with her promises and the agreement we'll all reach here... ...she'll go back home happily Who shall I begin with?

He sleeps in Freedom Square You sure he's still there? He sleeps in the park He's gone mad There's no paint in seeing him, it only upsets me My father separated from my mother and we ended up with a step-father My step-father made advances tome I mean, after he married my mum, he said "I want to have you too" I was not safe at home I couldn't sleep at night, I was scared he'd come to me I didn't say this to my mum. I was scared My mum used to take me to her work-place... ...and a lady saw me there and liked me She said she wanted me as a bride for her son My mum wanted to get rid of me, so she said yes After our marriage, I lived with my husband for only 6 months I kept on running away from his house... ..because he beat me up a lot I went back to my mum's... ..but my step-father continued harassing me Sot went on like this... but I still stayed at my mother's with my step-father One day my mum went shopping and I was alone with my step-father Thank God my mum came back early She saw my step-father standing over my bed, about to rape me I was asleep My mother screamed I woke up and saw my step-father and started hitting out at him And then my mother turned on me and took his side She said it was my fault I saw her picking up a can of kerosene to set me on fire So ran to the local police station I ran out of the house barefoot, I wasn't properly covered I told the police officer what happened I said "My step-father wants to rape me... "and my mum wants to set me on fire" I went back home with a police officer In front of the officer, my mum pulled my hair She bit me, she kept hitting me, she just went mad She did such strange things I said "I belong in this house, I'm your child" She said "I won't let you in, you're not a child anymore "Go and sleep in a cardboard box!" She can start work on Saturday or Sunday She can start work on Saturday or Sunday It's a factory for packing meat, liver, kidney, things like that I can handle it It's all mechanized, computerized cellophane wrapping It's all done by machine I know, I must make sure that everything remains on line I don't expect much I want to earn a living in a legitimate way, you know what I mean This is enough for me I must try to better my lot, this is very important to me Fine, go now and we'll talk about lodgings later I'm so grateful Parisa, I'm so happy - they've found me a job - Really! - I'm starting work on Monday!

Il have to wait until Monday Don't cry, please Please, don't cry Now that you've got your ID card, you'll find work too One day I'l come here for a visit... ...and I'l hear that Atena has found work and got her own place - Atena is unlucky - Now, don't say that! I'm the unlucky one. My mum died... ..my sister died too... ...my brother and father abandoned me. I have no one but God I was unlucky in my husband, in my step-father... Don't say such things - I was unlucky with everything This society has wronged me... ..but I want toreturn toit and rebuild my life I want to show them that I can doit and so can you Atena, don't cry... Crying is a sign of weakness Now, don't cry, you'll find work too Ms Agazadeh, did Ms Shirazi say anything about my situation? She's upset about ancther girl Now, don't cry Ms Shirazi is going to sort things out for you... ...and for several other girls here I can't take it any more Come now, weren't you consoling Rona just now? So you must comfort yourself too Everybody's shocked when they lear I've been married and divorced It's unbelievable! And I agreed to it, damn me! Nobody believes that I was married at 12 Those mistakes you made when you were young... Those decisions were made for you and you just accepted those decisions You have a lot time to make up for your past You're so young, there's time for everything Now you can decide for yourself - What's your mum's name? - Parvaneh Rahmani Mrs Rahmani, Atena has been waiting for you for a long time She's been very anxious and homesick I've got so many problems of my own The worst is, my husband's gone, he's left me with this baby That's my biggest worry You can't just sit there, staring at the walls... ...waiting for him to come back... ..without work, no money for food, no clothing... ...no proper food for these children This baby needs proper nourishment too If I know you'll take Atena back, I can find work for her... ...and her wages will come in handy for the family too She can work and provide for all of you I'm sure my husband will come back but it might take some time He's stuck with his first wife It'll take some time for him to divorce her But I can't take her back AllI can think about right now is gaing after him... ...or phoning him to see what's up If he comes back, I can't have her at home We can't send Atena home just for a short time We have to do what's best for her Well decide for her where to go and what to do Everybody says he'll come back He was so attached to us You stay here. We'll find you a job and somewhere to live I'l die if I don't see them - You must break away from them - I cant Clearly your mum is putting herself first She doesn't care about you She doesn't care that you're her daughter and that you need her She says "My life comes first, Atena's comes second” You should put yourself first too Wait until you're independent, with money of your own... ..then you'll be able to re-establish your links with them in a better way I was killing myself with worry about them That's what I'm saying: you shouldn't put yourself out for them any more Don't shed any more tears for them. Stand on your own two feet I know you don't want to get married Well find you a job and lodgings in one of our new centres When the time comes, you'll be independent You'll be able to make your own decisions, and we'll help you I'm not suggesting a complete break Just give yourself time to think Again, I'm not saying you should cut yourself off completely... ..but for now, your own life is more important Afena, isn't that right? You know why? Because she says her life is more important She wants to go after her husband and bring him back And if he comes, there'll be no place for Atena She's not a virgin I kept telling her to cover herself when she went to bed at night She didn't bother When I told her off, she'd sulk She simply didn't care I told her "When he comes home, you must dress and behave modestly" Still, she's your daughter Hardly 18 years old and already married twice - you sacrificed her! It's all her fault She brought it on herself Mrs Ghamgosar, I just wanted to say that... that... - Mrs Ghamgosar, I wanted to say... - Well, say it then! Tomorrow's Friday, I want to go home for the weekend but mum won't let me Let me finish talking to your mum, don't interrupt like this You can't just go for the day. If you go back, you must stay and find a job Can I say something? My mum and I never talk about it, I swear! tl be good for her if I come home, I can take care of the baby... ...and as soon as my step-father arrives, I'll come back here Your mum says you were careless about certain things Look, Mrs Ghamgosar, I know I was, I know I did wrong I know my mum is right But I can't stand it here any more, it's like a prison. I must get out! Do you want to go back for a while and see what it's like? Yes, but she won't let me I beat her half to death and she still wants to come back! She's your daughter, you can't kill her! - She needs a mother's love - I love you even if you kill me You can call us if she's any problem I know her, she'll be as good as gold for ten days and then... Tell her how other parents have changed after you've talked to them You say she'll behave for ten days - Yes, she'll pretend to be good - Then shel be just like before - No, I swear I won't! - She'll be just the same You tell her, Mrs Ghamgosar, tell her I'l be good I think you should give her a chance and see how it works out We're here, if you have a problem, you can send her back Can I stay in touch with you? Yes, any problem you have, if you think Atena isn't listening to you I'l do anything! I'l do anything she tells me! Just call us if you want to send her back I'm saying this for both your sakes: give her another chance There's no future for her with us, she can't stay here He loves the kids more than I do I'm their mother... ..but God knows, I don't love them as much as he does He's isn't here, but God knows, he loves them He loves them all so much It was all my fault, I know it was I knew she felt guilty, she was so unsettled here I guessed she felt she was to blame Now I suggest you give her another chance It might be better for you too You should know about such things You've dealt with girls like her You know how they behave You've reconciled lots of families, can't you do the same for me? Your mum is still angry with you, she needs time to get over it Because she thinks I'l be like before Atena is giving us her word. You have our phone number How much more must I suffer? I was unlucky with husbands Whenever you have a problem with her behaviour, send her back tous There are chairs there, please sit Tell your mum we'll help her out until we find you a job Will you be told off at home? Won't they ask why you ran away? If they tell me off, I'l run back here The girls here are leaving one by one Two go, another one comes Is this the brother who beats you? Tell me, do you want to go home? What does that nod mean? What? Well, if you want to go home, why did you leave in the first place? Because she's a silly girl No! She must realise that she shouldn't run away like this Many runaway children are kidnapped and killed for their hearts or kidney Imagine if that happened to you One shouldn't leave home like this Was it the right thing to do? And now you say you want to go home Tell me why - I just want to go home - Why? For what reason? Now, you've come here and and you've accepted responsibility Will you give me a written guarantee that nobody will beat her at home? If she runs away again, I'l come after you, you realise that? Sure, if I accept the responsibility for taking her back... Il get a guarantee from her family Il tell them not to hurt her Il take the consequences - Do you beat her? What's your name? - Kioumarz - Do you beat her? Tell the truth - Ill make him eat shit if he does She's only a child; if she misbehaves you should talk to her She's been here several days and I can see that she's a bit naughty Look at me! Last night she had a fight with another girl I'm not saying she's perfect She's a bit mischievous but you must learn how to handle these kids She doesn't know the meaning of love and compassion Her mother's paralysed in both legs She's been housebound for two months - Excuse me, her real name is Marjan - Marjan? She should have stayed home for her mother's sake She's the eldest daughter, she should help her mother Now she's not sure if she wants to go home or not It's obvious she has no consideration for her parents Say if you want to go home to your parents or stay here If you're not happy about going home... tell the lady and I won't take you I'm telling you, Marjan... - I want to stay here - Why? Your mother's been crying for you every night and your poor father... Don't you want to go back to look after your mum? Your sister's crying for you day and night. She's lonely Don't you want to go to school? You can't have everything, you know You must put up with hardship in life until you can stand on your own feet You must help your parents I've got this gentleman's guarantee... ..that no one will beat you again I assure you, there won't be any more beating Look, your brother's crying. He came all this way for you! Why do you want to stay here? True, they can look after you until you grow up... ..but your mum, your sister, they won't let you go In the end, they'll have to come and get you Families don't just give up their children We can't let someone stay here if they have a family You must go back to your family and live a normal life There's hardship in everybody's life You can't expect to have everything you want, you understand? Asthe lady says, when I take you home, I'l get guarantees... ..from your parents and from your brother here Yes, I'l send them to her Il'tell them that if they ever hurt you again... ..I'l bring you back here myself! Listen, next week I'l send a social worker to her house... ..to check how she is doing We're putting her in your hands, right? If you have a problem, go and tell the gentleman, he'll know what to do And don't leave home again for no good reason Society is full of wolves, do you understand? God was with you this time You got here safely All parents are strict with their daughters It's their right, isn't it? What do you really want? What can we do for you? I don't ever want to go back to that house Never? Don't you want to see your mum? My mother, yes, but not my father You love your mum. Don't you love your father? - Why? Does he beat you? -Alot I never complained about doing the housework I did whatever they told me They stopped me going to school so I could do the housework They kept me in the house all the time - Did you do the housework properly? - Yes Did you go out with friends without permission? Never. I never had such freedom I never went out without my parents How long has your father been an addict? Six, seven years He uses opium, you said? - What about your mum? -No Do you have any close friends, anyone to talk to? No, I'm not allowed out of the house What about relatives? None of our relatives ever come to our house... ..because of my father He was a shoe-maker, but now he buys and sells opium You can go now, come and talk to me whenever you want Why do you worry? Didn't you say you don't love them? That's true, but I miss my mum - Is your mum nice? - Yes If I see her I won't be able to let go of her I love my mum too and when I'm grown up Il go and live with her But not now, because she can't manage Amazing! I've been here 3 weeks and they finally decide to show us The Centre people can't really help me You don't have to face your family right now We'll talk to them first Just stay calm and say whatever you like to them I've got nothing to say to them God, I was so naive! Why, sister, why? I provided for you Whatever you wanted, I gave you I had nothing to wear myself, but I got you whatever you asked for Dad had a stroke Come and sit down She says she hasn't got her ID card We've got it Why hasn't she been to school? We live in a bad neighbourhood We told her certain things, but she wouldn't listen We told her she couldn't continue going to school there We said the girls in the neighbourhood were no good and a bad influence "They'll lead you astray, they'l corrupt you" At first she agreed, she said: "Brother, just don't lock me up!" I said "Whatever you want, I'l get you" We want to help you as much as possible But girls don't run away from home without cause This was without cause Listen, she was walking down the street with my mother Acouple of guys called out "what a nice figure you have!" My mum told her "Ignore them!" But my sister answered them back My mother told her to walk properly Her wallcis a little improper Begging your pardon... ..but if you were walking properly in the street... ..would I dare call out to you? - Are you saying it was Parisa's fault - Yes, she didn't walk properly My sister has no friends She isn't that type at all She just went crazy suddenly You can ask the neighbours When I told people that my sister had disappeared... they said "What sister?" Nobody had ever set eyes on her! Why should she run away? She had no problems at home Whatever she wanted I provided for her I want to talk to her for a few minutes - Shall I come too? - No, you wait here It's up to you. Your brother wants to talk to you and convince you I can't interfere when you two are talking Tell them what you told me, all the reasons you think are important... ..why you'd rather stay here than go back with them Now let's go back to the room She's done a lot for me I'd come home at 2 a.m. and she'd be waiting for me... ...and take my socks and trousers to wash - Well, Parisa? - She's done all this for me Do you love your mum and your brother? Why don't you speak up? If you don't love me, say so Have I done anything wrong to you? Say it, don't be afraid, I'l get you whatever you want Tell us about the problems at home so I can defend you Dad had a stroke, he's dying When you were at home, whenever mum had a fit... ...she never bit her tongue Since you left, her tongue is a mess Since you left home, life has no meaning I was sacked from the best job I ever had My sister must remain intact, you see She's a virgin Could I talk to my daughter alone? - Of course - We'll both talk to her Wait, sit down You can't let girls go out these days Shall I pour the water on him? - He passed out - Where's the father? He's outside. I want to talk to the father separately Call your father in - What guarantee shall I give you? - Not you, I won't accept yours You're not up to giving me a guarantee - What do you mean? - You can't even look after yourself - Why can't I? - I won't say any more But I've enough experience to know what your problem is... You're not fit to look after this child So you won't give us our sister back? No, we'll send her to a Centre... ..where she can continue her studies and lead her own life I'l agree to anything If my sister comes home, everythinglll be fine... If she doesn't, I'l cut myself to pieces and then I'll leave this place - Don't you threaten me! - I'm threatening myself Don't threaten yourself either - There's a law - I'l hang myself! I've had a million beatings from my father If I wanted to kill myself or leave home, I could have done it But I stayed for love of my mother and my two sisters These three are the loves of my life If my sister comes with me... if she comes back home, no problem She can go if she wants But if she won't come with me, then I'l cut myself to pieces There's no need for such a thing, there's always a sensible solution Don't you want to come with me? Don't you love us? I'm your servant - Don't you want to live with us? - This is pointless We must safeguard this child's future - What guarantee do you want? - Can you give us a guarantee, sir? Il vouch for her future - How can you give a guarantee? - Il give a written one Next time, if anything happens to her... Il drag you, both of you, tothe International Court at the Hague Il hang myself! Il give the guarantee myself I won't accept a guarantee from you! You're not fit to give one Mr Tagipour, let your daughter stay here for a while I can't bear her staying here Sort out your problem, then welll accept your guarantee Why did she say she ran away? She was mistreated at home, she wasn't cared for Keep quiet, Mr Tagipour. Tell me, Parisa, why did you run away? Tell the truth, I'd like to know the reason Please, keep quiet! Now speak up. What were your reasons for leaving home? Tell us the truth so I know how tohelp you Il be your slave, whatever you want I'l provide You sit down, please Now, tell us They beat me up, and they humiliated me in front of others, so I ran away Why did they beat you? You weren't the only one at home to get beaten, were you? - I suffered more... - More than me? You suffered too, but I got the beatings - What, more than me? - Will you let her speak? Go on, say what you want I was beaten a lot... Wherever I went, it was always with my mother Once or twice they allowed me to go out... ..but then they stopped it and I didn't go out at all Will you let her speak! Do you approve of your daughter's conduct? - What do you mean? - Has she misbehaved? She never went out alone, never I want you to tell me Did they just beat you up or were you beaten for a reason? Sometimes yes, but mostly they were just upset and took it out on me You keep quiet! You know your family best If they give us a guarantee, do you think they'l keep toit? Ifit were up tome, I wouldn't accept any guarantee from them I wouldn't accept their guarantee because I believe they'll break it Why? What do you know about us? You're not in a normal state I felt dizzy for a moment, that's all That's why we didn't let her go out Tell me, if they give a guarantee, will you go back? Do you want to go back? I'l give you whatever you want - I'm getting dizzy again - Go out, then! Go on! Go outside, get some fresh air Go on, get out! Ifthey give a guarantee and keep it, I'l go back What sort of guarantee? For instance, that there won't be any beatings, no humiliation... They used to pick on me for no reason I won't go back if it's going to be like it was before Was it your brother or your father who beat you? Tell her, child, tell her everything She says, yes. Why did you beat her? Perhaps this lady will show me where I went wrong Tell her, child When [tell her not to go out without my permission - Sit down, Mr Tagipour That week I eamed 19,300 toman Then the other week, 29,000 This week 52,000 toman I spent it all on taxis, looking for you Dad had a stroke, I fell off the roof... The roof collapsed... Come home with us tonight, please... For God's sake, come home I'l get you a jacket like mine I'l give you this one, alright? If she runs away again, you'll have to answer not only to our courts... ..but to the international courts... ...because you've been violating the rights of this child! - Punish me as you think fit! - I'm not punishing you You must bring her here for counselling once a month If you don't, the police will come and get her I'l bring her myself When you've filled in the form, send them to my room to sign it Give them an appointment to come for counselling She's to come with her parents once a month I'l give you any kind of guarantee Il guarantee good treatment No more beating! Whatever the girl asks for, I'l provide But she and her mother mustn't go to certain places without my permission I must have peace of mind when I go out Well discuss this later Whatever you want, whatever freedom you want, I'l give you The jeans you liked, I'l buy them for you You asked for a weekly allowance, I said that's fine You said you wanted to buy things in installments, I said fine - Parisa, where's your mum? - She's in the office Tell them you're happy with us, sis... come back home We have no more money to pay for taxis You know what this means? It means I'm responsible - Can't you sign? - No, I can't write Very well Is everything alright? Il give another guarantee, if you like No, there's no need You just keep your word, that'll be enough Will you get my wife to guarantee they won't go out? So that I have peace of mind when I leave in the morning? - You go out, I'l see to it - I beg your pardon I never knew they cared so much about me My dad hugged me when he saw me. He's never been like that with me I mean, I never felt my father's love before And my mum, and my brother... particularly my brother I didn't know he felt like this about me What if you go back and they start mistreating you again? That's not possible, I don't think so I mean I don't expect them to give me everything I want I only want them to treat me well It seems I'm moving towards the happiness of my dreams
