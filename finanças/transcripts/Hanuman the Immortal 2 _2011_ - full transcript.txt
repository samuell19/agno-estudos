- Oh no. This accident has brought us to quite a place, hasn't it? This place is beautiful. - And rather unique, sir. You see that mist down there? It's been there all the while. Never cleared up. Not once. It is believed strange things sometimes happen here, - How interesting. Looks like we'll be stuck here for quite a while if no one comes this way. - The engine seems fine, but the van is stuck. Let's try pushing the van. - Hello. What's your name, pretty wings? Mine is Bindi. You like it? Ah. So that's what you wanted to show me. Wow. - Bindi? Bindi? Bindi? Bindi? Bindi. - Hi. Bindi? - Wow. Look at that. Do you mind if I touch you? - Bindi. Bindi. Bindi. Hold on, Bindi. Just hold on. Bindi. - Tiki? Tiki, Tiki, Tiki? Come on, boy. Huh? Tiki? Okay, game's over. Now show up. We are getting late, Tiki. Enough now, Tiki. If you don't, uh? Huh? Let's go home. - Ah. Look at that tail. Perfect. - Now comes my favorite part. They'll crack it this time, watch. - Now. - There he goes. - He's got it, he's got it. Whoa. Ahh. - He is so, so extraordinary. - He is just a Vanar. - Where is Bala? - I don't know. Maybe-- - I am here, Master. Look, look what I found. - Ooh, what is that thing? Did you hunt it? - How did it get here? - What happened to its tail? - I think it is dead. Did you kill it? - What's that? - What happened to Tiki? Did it eat him? - Ooh, it's moving. I saw it move. - Get back, get back. - I've never seen anything like this before. - Careful, Bala. Careful. - I don't think she wants to attack. - I found her by the stream, near the falls. - So? Where do you come from? How did you get here, hm? What is your name, little girl? - Bindi. I don't know anything else. Where am I? - You are in Vanarvan, Bindi. We welcome you to our home. - Home? Actually, you are all quite different. Or maybe, I am quite different. But I can sure do that. - Hm. - There must be some reason why you're here, Bindi. Only time will tell. - Nimba? Are you sure it will be fine? Because Tiki certainly isn't. He's had some pretty tough times with your recent experiments. - Trust the druid, Bala. He's going to thank me for this. Just one drop, Tiki. And you'll have the finest fur coat, right up to the tip of your tail. Here we go. - Tiki, you look so funny. It works. It works. See? Now you have a natural disguise. - Is that another one of your experiments? - No, I'm not sure. I don't think so. - Bala? Bala? Bala? You won't believe what I saw. - Just like what you saw yesterday, and the day before, and the day before that? - No, no. Today, I saw a huge papaya with long thorns on it. - And we saw a little lizard with long hair on his head. - But, but I really did. And I also saw a frog hanging upside-down from a tree like a bat. And-- - Like this? - Yes, yes. Just like this. Look, Bala, look. Nimba has one. - What could it be? - To the Sacred Grove, everybody. Now. Gurudev, is, is, is dying. - I've had a vision, Hanuman. A dark force, A dark force is on its way. You must prepare before it's too late. - Gurudev? - Take, take. Take the praying maiden to her garden, her garden of light. A dark force is on its way. You must prepare, you must prepare. - Gurudev's words have never failed to come true. We must defend our existence. Be alert and watch every step. We pray for the best, prepare for the worst. - Hey. I have seen a lot of strange things. Maybe I should tell-- - Shh. We're talking about an invasion, Bindi. A war. Not about your hanging frogs. - She is the reason all this is happening. Ever since she came, we have had no peace. She is the reason all this is happening. - Akala, please. She is innocent. - What is the matter, Bindi? You all right? - Nobody believes me. Nobody. They think I'm making up stories. But I'm not. - You can tell me, Bindi. I'll believe every word you say. I promise. - I have seen strange things in the forest. Fruits with thorns. And, and trees with wriggling roots. Floating flowers and-- - Ah, quick! - What is it? - The stream, the stream. You, you, you have to see this for yourself, Master. Quick, quick. - See? I told you. There are strange things happening. I can show you more. A dark force, A dark force is on its way. - It's here. Darker than I had imagined. - We have to find another way, Master. I don't think we can fight this with our skills. - None of us can. We need help. And now, there is only one person who can help us. - Hmm. The Yaksha. This is going to be fun. Indeed. Your plans seem to be well on course, Raaka. But I foresee a pair of little hands guiding your destiny. So, beware. Little hands? - Erutan, Ekawa pu. Ah. Look, Oola. Look. Still nothing. Oola. Is that thing really flickering or have my own eyes gone nuts? By Kubera's coffers. What's wrong with my forest? I hate to think of it, but there seems to be some unwanted intrusion. Ah. Ah. Intrusion indeed. Mirik. Now we can talk. I was beginning to worry. What took you so long? That weirdo was getting on my nerves. I've been working, Mirik. And if you are done owling around, we can get on with some serious business. And does that business have anything to do with, a pair of little hands, hm? Finish it. I want it out of my way. Ah, ah, ah. When you're looking for a big fish, Raaka, it's good to have a tiny little bait. He must be on his way by now. You know what to do. - Tiki. Where are you off to? Where's Bala? Hiding from Bala again, are you? Tiki, is that you? Huh? - Run, Bindi, run. I'll take care of this. Hanuman! Dana! Shera! Help! - Master? - Bala, are you okay, huh? - Master. That thing was no ordinary creature. - I do not know what or who is behind this. All I know is that this has to stop. But how? How? That answer is hidden somewhere in Gurudev's riddle. And we need the Yaksha's help to crack it. He is the guardian spirit of Varnavan. But, he can also be a tricky customer. Whatever it takes, I must meet him. - And once we get there, everything will be fine. Let's go? - What? No, Bindi, not this time. - But you need my help. Remember? I was the first one who saw the strange things in the forest. Now, I'm an expert at seeing strange things. Well, almost. - Hmm. Your expertise will be needed here all the more. So I request you to stay with the group. Hm? Everybody stays here. No one leaves the hamlet for anything. Bala? - Master? - Until I return, this family is your responsibility. Take care of them. - You overestimate yourself, Hanuman. - What? You doubt his might, Akala? - Look, lad. I may not be his favorite disciple, but I love and revere him just as much as you do. - Then why doubt him? - Because I care for him. Unlike the rest, we both know that this is not the mighty Hanuman who could destroy an entire army by himself. For that, someone must remind him of his ultimate abilities. And that someone cannot be a Vanar like you or me. - I'll be back soon. - I hope Master comes back soon. - He should've taken me with him. I know I could have helped him out. I can still go. - No. - Maybe he needs me right now. Can I? - Bindi. We have strict orders not to leave the hamlet. Especially a nine-year-old with a knack for trouble. Is that clear? - He is the fifth one, Bala. And this thing is spreading fast. - Huh? - Do you need any directions? You can always ask. It's for free. Never mind. I know where you want to go. Follow me. This way please. - She is not there, Bala. - Did you check the grove? The fruit yard? - Every bit of it. Nimba hasn't seen her either. - She's gone. - What? - I saw her footprints down the cliff. - Are you sure they were-- - Good if she's gone. We have enough on our hands already. - Bindi is one of us, Akala. And she's just a little child. - Yes, a human child. And she is not one of us. And never will be. You were the one to get her here, Bala. - To save her life. That is what Dharma tells us to do. - Oh, very good. Then go and save her life once again. We have our own to worry about. - It's going out, out of control, Bala. The number has doubled. They seem to be freezing from the inside. - No. That was easy. I think I'll go that way. Look at that. Do you like it, Bindi? - Yeah. There's more for you. - Yaksha? - My good, old friend. Come in, come in. I see you after so long. - Uh, I don't see you yet. - Oh, here I am. Right before you. By the way, I hope you had a pleasant journey. Did you like my garden? I designed it myself. - Yaksha, your forest is dying. Really? - It is being killed by some invisible force that has the guile to invade our hidden land, but has no guts to show up and face us. - Is that so? - Time is running out, Yaksha. Delays will make things worse. You have to help us find-- - Ah, excuse me. These birds take so long to learn their manners. Look. I understand your concern. But I am a little surprised to see a legendary warrior all shaken and stirred by some silly, natural disorder. As you can see, everything is fine here. In case you are really scared of going back, you can stay here as long as you want. Or as long as I want. - Ah. That was some fragrance. - Who are you? - Whoever I choose to be. Whatever I choose to be. - We call them cheap trickster. - Now, that's an oversimplification. See, I have worked very hard and very long on this. - Impressive. But why are you wasting your talent on us? Hm? - Let's go back in time about 10,000 years. What do you see? Remember. The Great War? The one that decimated an entire race? I survived, Hanuman. But unlike you, I had no blessings of a boon. All I had was the wrath for revenge. Every moment I felt my body screaming, begging for death. But my mind had other plans. And my skills were all in place. - Ah, so this is it. But this one is not the same. Neither is this one. Hmm. But I like all of them. - We fought a war to seek justice, not revenge. We do not believe in revenge. - Know what? I do. More now than I ever did. And guess who's been my greatest inspiration? You. - Then do what you want with me. Why harm those who have nothing to do with you? - Okay. Ha. I can go on doing this all day, for the rest of my life. It's fun. But the trouble is, I can't kill you, all because of one silly, stupid boon. So I had to find a suitable alternative. Your family. Look. Look what I've done to your forest. How beautiful it looks. And when I am done, the souls of our dead will finally rest in peace. Think, Anjaneya, think. There must be a way out. - Shh. I hear someone coming. Ah, this seems to go on, and on, and... Oh, here we are. - Huh? This can't be true. - Ah. You are here? What are you doing here? - Bindi. - Look, I made it without a scratch. Now let's move. What are you waiting for? C'mon. Oops. Sorry. I didn't, I, uh, is this place yours? - It seems it is. - Oh. You look weird. Are you the Yaksha? - Indeed I am. I've been waiting for you. We've planned something very, very special. Just for you. - Thanks, but right now, we're in kind of a hurry. So, some other time, I promise. Let's go. - You hurt my feelings, Bindi. I am so, so, disappointed. - Okay, okay, don't be sad. I'll explain. See, it's like this. - Bindi, no. - We are looking for this lady who can help us save our forest. She is called-- - No. - The praying maiden. Her prayers are the key to your existence, Raaka, to your unbound strength. Use it well, for the day she opens her earthly eyes, you shall exist no more. - You should have told me. What a waste of time. You want her? She's right here. - Where? I don't see her. - Come here. I'll show you. Look very carefully at that tree. What do you see? - A light. A beautiful light. - Good. Your lady is right inside that light. Go and get her. - Wake up, Bindi, wake up. There's nothing out there. - Oh. That is so unfair. So, let's have something out there. How about this? Unauthorized knowledge is a very dangerous thing. See, this innocent little human, and of course, so many others will die just because of you. - Where could that maiden, ooh, that's like a nice lady, - Don't do it, Raaka, don't do it. - Too late. But I can sense your feeling of guilt for what you have done, so, I'm going to let you try and save that little morsel. Happy? Ah. - Oh yeah, sorry, just changed my mind. Not quite in the mood for charity. - Raaka... How does it feel being helpless, huh? It's my turn for a laugh. - Bindi... Until I return, this family is your responsibility. Take care of them. - No. - Look at you. What a shame. You are a disgrace to all those ignorant fools who believe in your strength. Who think you can protect them. You can't even protect a little child. I can. Remember my brothers in pain? Remember the dead warriors? Nothing could stop you then. Even Maya, the weapons of illusion, could not touch you. You could do whatever you wanted to. You could fly across oceans. You could leap over mountains. - Oh. Look at what you have done. This is the third time you have ruined our yagna. You have to pay for your mischief, you naughty little boy. - Huh? - From now on, you shall not possess your special abilities unless someone unlike yourself reminds you of it. And grow so large that our biggest elephants would trample under your toes. Giant trees would seem like weeds. Look at that. - Where are you, Master? Thanks for the facts. What was that? - That, my friends, is Hanuman. - Master. - Welcome to my land, Raakasura. - Are you all right? Let's get out of here. How can you leave so soon? The party has just begun. - Hold on, Bindi. - Bindi. - See? I found him. And how? - There are things you must know. Just think. What awaits the world if we can't stop him here? - If the maiden holds the key to his life, she wouldn't be an ordinary lady. Could be someone well beyond our imagination. Maybe unlike anyone we've been looking for. What if she's right here before us but we can't see her because we don't know her? - Yes, What if the maiden is not a maiden at all? - What do you mean? - I mean, what if she's not a lady or a woman at all? But someone else? - Hmm. Or something else? - Exactly. Like, like this, see? It's called the Lizard's Paw. But it's only a herb. So, the praying maiden-- - Could be anything. A rock? - An insect? - A seed? - Or a flower? I'd like the maiden to be a flower. I love flowers. Huh? Bala, Bala. Where did you find me? Where? - Near, near the waterfall. - Take me there, now! Did you hear me? Now! - Okay, okay. - I'll be back. Let's go. - She's gone to tell us why she came here. - Um, you were here. But this place has changed a bit. - Good. Now, let's look for a big, blue flower. It should be somewhere here. It came down with me. - But that was a long time ago, Bindi. It must have disappeared by now. - If she is the maiden, she'll go nowhere. Let's look. - Okay. It should be in there. Focus, focus. Got her. - Careful, Bala. Bala? What's going on? - Got it. - You're sure? This is the one? - Of course. I mean, you'd know better. - It looks different. - It does? - Bala. You've hurt your eye. - Eye? Where? Oh. It's, it's nothing. Just an old, uh, it's nothing. - Let me see. Um, okay. Let's go. Bindi. - Huh? Did you hear that? - What? I heard nothing. - It sounded like Bala. Like you. But not like you, like Bala. - Bindi. You're hallucinating. Let's go. - Bindi, get away from it. Now. I'll deal with him. Who are you? Where is the flower? - It's, uh, it's gone. You will be gone too. All, all of you will be gone. You are lucky I have not killed you yet. But, I am running out of my patience. Quit it. - That's him. He must be close. - Got to be now or never. - But we haven't got the maiden yet. - Can't wait, Akala. Everybody, stay close. - Hanuman. Take care. Believe me. You are so much better this way. Now, the least I can do for you is get you a decent job in my army. - First, I must get him out of Yaksha's body. I feel pity for you, Raaka. You have no idea how little time you have. - It is you who needs mercy, Hanuman. See what you've done to your forest and your innocent people. You, you are the one responsible. So now you'll pay for it. Watch them die. - That won't help you, Raaka. - But this sure will. - Huh? How did you,. Where, where is... Give it to me. - Well done, Bala. Thanks, Bindi. You are a shame to your entire race, Raakasura. At least get into your own skin and show up before your dead cousins laugh at you and curse you. Show up if you carry your ancestors' blood. Your time is running out. - Happy? Now, give it to me before I am forced to take it from you, unpleasantly. - Go ahead, take it. Try again. Don't give up. - Give it to me, give it to me. You can't have it. You can't have it, it's mine. - Sure. Catch. - No. - I am keeping my promise, Raaka. I am setting you free. - He's breathing. He's breathing. Oh, my son is breathing. My son. - What is it, Master? - Bindi? Where's Bindi? - There she is. - Oh. Wow. Do you mind if I touch you? Bindi! - Bindi, what are you doing here? Oh, Bindi. I know you are missing your home. You were destined to be here to save Varnavan, and now it is time for you to return. Your parents are still near the cliff because a year in Varnavan is just a second on the earth. - I'll miss you all. Thank you for the wonderful moments here. - It's time for us to leave. Mama. - Did you hear that? It's, it's our daughter's voice! - Mama! Bindi! Bindi. Bindi, my darling. Are you okay? - My little princess. We thought we lost you. Thank God you're safe. - Let's get out of this place. - Sure, as soon as we get the van off the rocks. I can't believe this. No wonder everyone says this place is magical. - Jai, Hanuman.
