- Are you sure you don't wanna come to Vienna for the holidays? - You know it's going to be my first Christmas with Roy. - Yeah, so bring him here. Vienna is beautiful and romantic during Christmastime. Besides, everybody's getting all set up for the holiday ball season. Maybe you guys could go to one. - You should go to one. You're always the better dancer. - Yeah, it's only 'cause you stopped practicing ballet in high school. - Well, I still go to cardio barre classes. - Yeah, that is not the same thing. - How's the search for your dad's family coming? - No family yet. - I still can't believe my big brother's gonna be alone on Christmas. - Don't worry about me. I just want to make sure that you and Roy have a romantic first Christmas. - Ooh, I gotta go! He's taking me to this really fancy restaurant. And he says he wants to talk about our future, something important. - Hm, like a proposal? - I don't know. I hope. You'll be the first one I call. Hey. - Hey, babe. - So sorry I'm late. Thank you. I got caught up talking to Daniel. Brought you some homemade Christmas cookies. - Thanks. You look gorgeous, by the way. - Thanks. So, I'm really excited to know what you wanted to talk about. - Remember when you said you wanted to give me the best gift you could? - Yeah. - Nothing, really nothing, would make me happier for you to make my Christmas fantasy come true. - Yes. - So I want you to meet someone special. - Am I finally gonna meet your mom? - No, not really. Hey... - Hi. You must be Amy. So nice to meet you. - Who...who is that? Who is she? - Uh, this is Elaine. Elaine? Amy? Have a seat. - Who is she? - I'm his girlfriend. - Yes. - I'm his girlfriend. - Yes. - You said she was okay with this. - She is okay with this, right? - Okay, but what am I... Why would I be okay with this? - Amy, what are you doing? Okay. I'll only be a second. Amy! - I can't believe I thought I was gonna marry him! - Yeah, I'm sorry, Ames. I know how much you liked him. I see you got my Christmas present. - Oh, yeah. Thanks. It's pretty. - And handmade. - Tell me more about Vienna. I need a distraction. - Okay. It's magical. There's Christmas lights on all the shops. Everything smells like gingerbread. And everybody's getting extra hyped for all the extravagant Balls happening. - Oh, yeah, with the big gowns and the dancing. I can't believe that they still do those. - And everyone is extra hyped right now because the biggest Ball of the season, the Christmas Ball, is like it's right around the corner. - Sounds amazing. - Hey, you should come to Vienna. - Oh, no, I can't. - Why not? Look, we're family. We shouldn't both be alone on Christmas. - I can't. It's crazy. I... - Okay, look. Let's make a deal. Come out to Vienna and stay with me through Christmas. Try some new food! See some new sights! Maybe even go to a Ball. I think getting outside of your comfort zone is exactly what you need right now. - I don't know. - Vienna, it's so full of all this magical old world charm. - Does sound nice. - Plus, it's 5,000 miles from Roy. - Yeah. - Yeah, as in you're coming 'cause I'm not taking "nein" for an answer! - I'm coming to Vienna. - You're coming to Vienna? - I'm coming to Vienna! - Wow! I did not think that was gonna work! - I'm coming to Vienna. I'm gonna come see you. - Hey, and who knows? You might even meet a prince and get married. - That's not funny. - Hey. - Hey! Nice to see you too! - Sorry. Didn't get any sleep on the plane. - Hi. - How's it all going, by the way? - It's good. Taking me forever to track down my dad's family, but I think I found my uncle. - Daniel, that's great! - Yeah. I'm just... I'm hoping he can tell me a little bit more about my biological father. He died when I was so young that I'm trying to get a better sense of where I come from, you know. - You will. I know it. And when you do, maybe Mom, Dad and I will finally know why you're so weird. - Hm. And then you'll also maybe know why I don't invite you to the palace when I discover I'm royalty. - Oh, you're so funny. - Let's go drop your bags and go see the town. - Sound of Vienna concerts. - Welcome to Vienna's best café. - Thank you. - I'm so sorry. I've got to take this. It could be about my uncle. - Okay. - Hello? This is Daniel. - May I be of some assistance? - Um...you know, we'll just have a couple of large cappuccinos. - Two Café Mélange. Right away. - Great. So that was my researcher. Ames, I'm a nephew. I've got an uncle. He's here. His name is Markus. They could call me at any time. - Oh my God. - I can meet him...I... - That's amazing! - You sure? - Hey, the coffee was amazing, but you know I don't eat anything with eggs. - So much for trying new things. - I am working my way up to that. - Sure. - Hey, who's that? Think they're hosting a Ball? - Probably. Sorry. Hello? Okay, sure. Right now? I'll see you soon. Great. That was my researcher. My Uncle Markus, he wants to meet me. - Right now? - Yeah. - That's incredible! - I'm sorry I can't sightsee with you. Are you gonna be okay on your own? - Sure, yeah. I've been here about a day and practically an expert now. - Okay. You know, go check out the Danube Tower. It's great. It's beautiful. The view is incredible, especially this time of year. - Okay, I will. - Okay. You're not gonna regret it. - Okay. - Thank you! I love you! - Love you! - Bye! - Okay. - Ich bien... ...lost. - I'm afraid you screwed that one up, Lukas. - Tommy, I'll take the class by myself. - Waltzing alone? And I think you can clap with one hand too, right? You know, this is for the Midnight competition. And I'm afraid there's no sense in continuing this class without a partner. - How am I going to find a dancing partner on such short notice? - You have this little playbook. Find someone. - My apologies. I'm just gonna ask one of these gentlemen over here, if you don't mind. Hi. Hopefully, you can understand me. I was just curious if you guys are practicing for a Ball and if there are any tickets left. I keep hearing amazing things about it and I'd really like to go to one. You can't understand anything I'm saying. - No...yes... I can. We are practicing for the Ball, the Christmas Eve Ball. - That's the fancy one that sells out tickets a year and a half in advance? - Yeah. Actually, it's more like two years in advance, but, yes, that one. - Can you help me get tickets? - No, not directly, but I do have a proposition for you. - I don't know what you've heard about American girls... - Do you have any ballroom dance experience? - No. I mean, I did ballet in high school. We almost went to Nationals junior year. - I'm Lukas Hofbauer. - Amy. Listen, I know this is going to sound completely strange, but I'm looking for a dancing partner. And I must attend this class to qualify for the competition of the Midnight Show for the Christmas Eve Ball. It showcases the best dancers in Vienna. - Mm-hmm. And you want me? - Yes. Yes, but once you commit, that's it. I mean, you would have to be my dance partner and commit your time and energy to waltz. If we get through the competition, we'll be able to attend the Christmas Eve Ball. And if you take the class, I'll be your personal tour guide in Vienna to whatever you want to see for the rest of this beautiful holiday season? - Well, I did... - I know... - Promise myself I would try new things and I do really want to see the Ball. Okay, yeah, I'll be your dance partner! - All right! Wunderbar! - Yeah. Wunderbar! - Welcome to Christmas in Vienna. - Everybody? We have a new dancer with us today. Please welcome... what was your name? - Amy, Amy Michaels. Hi. - Hi. - This was kind of a spontaneous decision. I flew in from Chicago after catching my boyfriend with another woman. But...but I'm moving on and I'm trying new things. So I think it's working 'cause two days ago I really didn't expect to be dancing ballroom in Vienna, right? So, cest la vie... Oh, that's French, not German, but I ramble when I'm nervous. - Okay, everyone, come on, get up. Break is over. - Two bodies... - One mind... - Four feet. - They don't mess around, do they? - No, they take the waltz very seriously here. Here we go. Don't look at me. - I... I feel like I'm in over my head, like you should find somebody who actually knows what they're doing. - No, no, no. A deal is a deal. You can do this, okay? - Guys, always maintain contact! - Oh. - All right? And, remember, the judges will be looking for the perfect form. We try this with music. Start with the basic right turn just to get a little bit of a warmup, okay? On my count. - Go. - Oh! - I'm so sorry. Are you okay? - I'm fine. - Everyone back to one! Once again. You live in Chicago, hm? Take your head to the left. Good. Shoulders down and elbows up. Nice. Now keep your posture. - Posture was never really my forte as a ballerina. - Go. - Don't look at me. - I wasn't. God, get over yourself. - No. It's just that if you look at me, you'll get dizzy. - Oh! - I am so sorry. - You really got to watch your feet a little bit more. I mean, take this seriously, okay? It's not that hard. One, two, three, two, two, three. - Okay, I wanted to try new things. But I didn't come to Vienna to be ordered around, okay? I'm gonna find my own way to the Ball. You , uh... Good luck in your competition. - Well, nice meeting you! And thanks for confirming everything I already knew about stubborn Americans! - Well, thank you for confirming everything I already knew about snobby Europeans! - What? - Wait, the Lukas Hofbauer? You've been here less than 24 hours. You already head-butt the Prince Harry of Vienna. Gonna see him again? - He was kind of a jerk. - Uh... - I'm so done with jerks. - Right. That's fair, but counter-argument. I hear he's a heck of a dancer and he might be your best way of getting into the Christmas Ball. Come on! You said that you'd get outside your comfort zone. - Okay. Yeah, maybe I'll try to find him and apologize. Or something. - Oh, wow! That's gonna be painful. - Get outside my comfort zone. - Yeah, that's the spirit. - Hi. I'm looking for Lukas Hofbauer? I took a dance class with him today. I wasn't very good. I bought him a Gugelhupf to apologize. - Who is it? - Lukas, it's Amy. I brought you a Bundt cake! - I got it from here. Thank you. - Amy? How did you even find me? - Have you ever Googled Lukas Hofbauer's address? - No. - Good. Don't. - Well, guess you know who I am now. - Yeah. Kind of. I actually just came to apologize. Dancing seems really important to you and I... - That's so sweet of you. I feel like I need to apologize to you as well. Thanks for the cake. That's very kind. Why don't you come inside? It's freezing out here.. - Sure. - Okay. - Thank you. I also tried to find you some edelweiss. I know how you Austrians love it. They have a whole song about it. Unfortunately, it's out of season. - It's also written by Americans, I think. - Really? - Yeah. - Huh. Well, speaking of, where's the rest of the Von Trapp family and the Christmas decorations? - Yeah, well, I haven't been able to bring myself to decorate in the last couple of years. - Really? It's the best part. I mean, your place is so beautiful, it makes up for it. It looks like it has so much history. This chandelier is beautiful. - My great-great-grandfather actually made that one. - He made it? I'm so sorry! I'm such a klutz! - It's okay. - I get you a gift and I ruin it. - You know, I just realized I haven't lived up to my end of the bargain. I would love to take you to town. If that's okay with you? - Yeah, of course, - Okay. - Wow, you Viennese really do take Christmas seriously. It's my kind of town. - For me, Vienna is the most beautiful city in the world. And this is when it comes alive. You know everybody's preparing for the Holiday Ball season. It's like a Viennese requirement. - You really do love it here, don't you? - I've traveled the world, but for some reason I always come back home. 35 years ago my parents won the midnight show and were crowned King and Queen at the Christmas eve ball. Shortly after, they got married and they had me. - So dancing really is in your blood. - Yeah. - Of course, they always wanted to see me win as well. But they're gone now. - Oh Lucas, I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. It's been a few years. But now I feel like I have to win it for them. Listen, I just want you to know I was going to compete with my ex. We were pretty much going to win this thing until she decided to find a new partner. - That's why you need me. - Exactly. She said she didn't think that she could win with me as a partner. So she found a new one, in and out of the ballroom. Some French guy, Philippe. - That's awful. I can relate. My ex cheated on me too. - You know what they say. Misery loves company. - I've had worse company. - It's beautiful, huh? Uh-huh. Very nice. - I haven't done that in so many years. - It's because Vienna suits you, that's why. - You think? - Yeah. You know, now all we need to do is get you to waltz the way you ballet. - Yeah, you see, it's a little bit different, though, Because when I was a ballerina, I was actually more of a soloist. So all I really had to do was trust myself and my body. But the waltz, I gotta trust you. - Oh, no. See? You can trust me. - I'm hungry. Are you hungry? I know a really great place around here. - You do? - Yeah, I do. - You do. Okay, well then, try to find it. - Yes, um, I think it's this way. It's awful people can't just leave you alone. - It's a little odd having all of Austria cares about who you're dating. - Well, if it makes you feel any better, I didn't know who you were until 12 hours ago. - Don't feel bad. If it makes you feel any better, I didn't know who you were 12 hours ago either. - Two cups of the best Heyse Schokolade. - Danka Schoen. - Thank you. - You know, other Viennese may argue, but personally I think there is nothing better during the holidays than a hot chocolate. - The secret is the egg yolk. That's what gives the rich texture. - I don't usually do eggs... but here's to trying new things. - All right. To new things. - Mm. - Mmm. Mmm. I think I'm okay with eggs now. This might be the best thing I've ever tasted. - Thank you. I'll leave you to enjoy. - I need to thank you for tonight. Nobody's really ever done anything that nice for me before. - That's sweet. I do enjoy making you smile, Amy. - You do? - Very much so. - Sorry to interrupt, but that young lady wanted me to hand you this. - Well, uh... This is awkward. - You know, I don't know what I'm doing. I really... I can't get strung along again. - Amy... - I don't know. It seems like you have a lot of girls around. This hang out...whatever it is is over, okay? - Amy, please, just... - And I can pay my own bill, okay? - Just wait, please? - I got to go. - Hey, Amy! - Finished, sir? - Thank you, Dominik. - You got in late last night. - Yes. Amy and I went to Café Sluka after we went to the Christmas market. - You really seem to like her. - Yes, I do, but I think I mucked it up. - Does she have any potential as a dance partner? - She does have talent and that American stubborn determination. - Americans can be quite annoying, but very determined, too. Maybe that's what you need. You may not win this year, but the connection you two share could help you win for years. You need to tell her that. - Hm. And here I was thinking you didn't even like her. - It's nice to see you smiling again. With Lydia, you would just go from sulking about the mansion to dancing to sulking again. I don't want that old Lukas back. Do you? - She did leave her wallet last night, so I will have to see her eventually. - Maybe that was on purpose so she could see you again. - Maybe we should try to find her. - Hey, I think we should go to Christmas mart and get some Gluühwein. - What's glue-wine? - Gluühwein. It's hot spiced wine. - Yes. That's what I want. - Oh, you're thinking about Lukas, aren't you? - No. Yes! - Come on, I thought you said that you walked out on him. - Well, I did. I don't know what I'm doing. The whole thing was a bad idea! - Bad idea? I mean, aren't you ever gonna see him again? - I really want to see him again, but he deserves to have a partner with some modicum of waltz ability. - Oh, will you stop selling yourself so short? Jeez! Look, the deal we made when you came here is that you're gonna have some fun and try some new things. And not try and win at every new thing that you do try! I mean, think of everything that you've done since you got here. You learned to waltz, you head-butt a rich guy, and you tried stuff with eggs in it. That's huge! - Okay, yeah, I know. - Shall we get some Gluühwein? A little liquid courage? - Yes, let's do it. - Ah! Ja. Guten morgen, Uncle Markus. Yeah, yeah. That was Uncle Markus. He's in town. He wants to see if we want to grab some lunch. - You go see him and have some bonding time. I'm gonna go explore, okay? - Okay. - Let's go. - Thank you. - Oops! - I'm so sorry! - So sorry. I'm such a klutz. - Whoa, are you American? - Yeah. - Where are you from? - Chicago. - Really? Me too. Hal Stenson. - Amy Michaels. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - What brings you here? - Oh, vacation... getting away from... I am spending Christmas with my brother. You don't happen to know about these places that have Glu or glow wine... - Gluühwein, yes. - Yes. - They're amazing. There's a place up here. Wanna grab it? - Yeah. - Let's go grab some. - So you're the Chief Nursing Officer for the Lakeshore Pediatric Hospital? - That's why I'm here. It's the latest in medical tech, huge conference. - What made you decide to become a nurse? - When I was 10, I got appendicitis just before Christmas and I was admitted to Lakeshore. - You had to spend Christmas in the hospital? - Yeah, but it wasn't so bad. The nurses... Oh, my goodness, the nurses were amazing. They decorated my room and even gave me a stocking with my name on it. I knew one day I wanted to return the favor. - That's really nice, Hal. - Amy... You know, you really have beautiful eyes. - That's really sweet. And I don't want to seem presumptuous in any way, but I don't really know what I'm looking for right now. - No, no. - But I'm so happy that I got to share some glow wine with you. - Gluühwein, Gluühwein, yeah. - Say no more. I've got to get going. - Okay. - I actually promised some people at the conference I'd meet up with them. Let me grab the check. - No, no, no, no, I got it. It's on me. - Are you sure? - Yeah. You helped me find the place, so... - It's great meeting you, Amy. Merry Christmas to you. - Merry Christmas. Bye. I have to pay. I can't find my wallet. - Oh... - I must have lost it. I'm so sorry. I promise I'll come back and I'll pay you. I promise. - Okay. I found it. Hey, Lukas. - Hey, Amy. You, uh, left your wallet yesterday. You weren't trying to trick your way into seeing me again, were you? - No. But I do want to apologize for how I behaved. Thank you. And I have to say I... I know I'm not the best dancer. I really want you to be able to win this. - I feel like I need to apologize 'cause it was a misunderstanding. I want you to be my partner. I just feel like winning will come in time. - Okay. You been waiting long? - Amy, Lukas is on his fourth hot chocolate waiting for you. Can I get you one as well? - Yes, please. So what do we have to do to get up to speed with the competition in two days? - Practice, practice, practice. - The waltz is simple. All you have to do is keep your center steady. Don't forget to take big sweeping steps. Your turn. - Oh, okay. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Hey, Daniel. Is everything okay? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'll be right there. I gotta go. - Everything okay? - Yeah, yeah. It's nothing serious. I just... I have to go now. So I'll see you tomorrow? - Yeah. - Yeah. Bye. Thank you for returning my wallet. Hey, what's going on? What's wrong with Uncle Markus? - Wrong? No, nothing. He's fine except I invited him over for dinner. - You said this was an emergency. - Yeah, it is. Look, I have no idea how to cook a traditional Austrian feast. He's from one of the oldest families in Vienna. He's gonna disown me. - Daniel, you're being silly. - Am I? Am I? I think I should go back to Chicago...like now. - Okay. Uncle Markus is the reason that you're here. - Right. - He doesn't care about what you cook for him. He just wants to spend time with you. - Yeah. - I've got Mom's Christmas ham recipe, we'll make that. Be nice to make it for somebody who actually appreciates it. - Ham? Okay. - Yeah. - Okay. - Okay. We can do that. That'd be great. - Okay, can you handle buying me a ham? - Mm-hmm, yeah. Totally. - Can you handle that? - Yeah, yeah. - Awesome. - The one with feathers, right? - Go! - This looks delicious. - Who knew Amy could cook? - Oh, that's funny. Good thing I have my brother's support at all times. - Speaking of brothers, I want to show you something, Daniel. Daniel? Amy? Meet your family. Our family settled in Vienna in the early 1800s. This is your cousin, Uli and your great aunt, Aunt Mavis, on the family farm. - Wow, a cousin and an aunt. - They took such great pride in it. It was one of my favorite places to visit growing up. It's why I moved there after I retired from city life. - It's beautiful. - Oh, who's that? - That's me and my wife, Greta. This was taken at the Christmas Eve Ball years ago at the Kursalon. Where we all danced the famous... This was such fun. One of my fondest memories. - Look at that dress. That gown is amazing. They don't make them like that anymore. She wears it well. She's beautiful. - Yes. Yes, she was. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh, it's ok. We had a very happy life together. What a dancer! - You know, Amy's actually taken up ballroom. - Well, I'm trying to get in to the Midnight Show so that I can go to the Christmas Eve Ball. - Christmas Eve Ball? That's the biggest one in town! - All right, guys. You know I don't expect anything less than perfection from you tomorrow at the competition. No pain, no gain. Let's get to work. And always think while you're dancing of this beautiful room. You have to feel it, okay? From the beginning, starting position, please. - Scary. - This one is the must. Like he said, try to feel the room. - I will. - Good. - I'm glad to see that you two are more in the steps today. Good job, good job, very good. All right. Okay, thank you! - All right, how do you feel? - Thanks, everybody. Remember, the one who place in the top four get to dance at the midnight show. for a chance to get crowned King and Queen of this year's Christmas Eve ball. Thank you very much. See you tomorrow. - This could just be our year, Vicky. - Yes, especially if Lukas dances with her. - Don't listen to them. Your dancing has gotten much better. - Yeah? Better enough to get into the Ball? - Well, your movement and technique are there, but it's a little sloppy. - Sloppy? That's blunt. - Blunt is the Austrian in me. I apologize for saying it, but it's true. Hey, I mean it in a funny way. - Ha-ha. Funny. - You know what they say about Austrian humor. - No. What? - It's no laughing matter. - What can I do? I want my waltzing to get better. I want to do this right. - Okay, listen. The waltz is about emotion and precision coming together, and about practice, practice, practice. - Lukas? Are we going? - Hey, Tommy. Sorry. Is there any way we can stay a little longer today? - Sure. I'll give you the keys, but keep it between us and lock up after. - Thanks. - And remember... You break it, you buy it. But's that not a problem, right? And, Amy, this was much better today. Good job. See you tomorrow guys. - Coming from the mean guy. - Yes. - Come on. Stretch out a little bit. And then we'll do it without shoes this time, okay? - Okay. - Okay, so the Vienne Waltz is one of the oldest forms of ballroom dancing in the world. Steps are pretty easy, but the details are complicated. I'll lead. When I go forward, you go back. When I go right, you go left. But we're going to spend a little more time on posture and feeling it. So here we go. Elbows up, shoulders down, beautiful. I'm gonna count. Three, two, one, go. That's it. Nice, nice. Nice. - Oh, sorry. - It's okay. No worries. Let's take it again. - Okay. - Everything up. Perfect. Feel it. Feel the music. Here you go. One, two, three. Nice. That's it. Right here. There you go. - Yeah. - Oh, gosh. Amazing. - The dip. - Ooh, hi. - Okay, we did enough for today. It was amazing. - Do you think we got a chance of winning or, you know, at least getting fourth and getting in the Midnight Show? - We'll just keep practicing. - Okay. - I also would like to ask you to dinner tonight as a thank-you. I just need to make one quick call. - What does the great Lukas Hofbauer have planned now? - Surprise. - So, enjoy Vienna so far? - It's more beautiful every day. - Well, let me show you my favorite view. And it's not from the Danube Tower. - These are amazing. - Not as amazing as you are. - That was a little corny. - Well, I'm a corny kind of guy. What can I say? I'm sure you've been on one of those, right? - Of course, yeah. I try to go on the one in Chicago at least once every summer. - But not during Christmas. - No. - See? I think we should change that. - All right. - Huh? - It's cool. - I told you I wanted to thank you. - This is... This is too much! I mean, don't get me wrong. It's beautiful. Thank you, but it's too much. - No, it isn't, not for you. Come on, we worked so hard all day. Let's just enjoy the night and enjoy the view. Let me get you out of your jacket. Come on. - I bet you it's even more beautiful in the summer. - Oh, it sure is. You know, the kids out there picnicking on the shore, boats in the water. It's great. You should really see it. - I'm only here for another week. My real life is in Chicago. - So this isn't real life now? - I have had the best time with you, Lukas. And this has been incredible. But I can't pretend that this is what my life's gonna be from now on. - Okay. Well, then let's just enjoy your time here in Vienna. You know what? Here. Let's drink to that. To Christmas in Vienna. - Christmas in Vienna. - Sorry I have to do that, but I need one last dance. - Oh, I thought we were done practicing. - Well, if we can dance in a swinging Ferris Wheel car, we'll be so much better tomorrow on solid ground. - All right. Thank you so much for tonight, for dinner and the dancing. I'm never, ever going to forget it. It's so beautiful. I'm bummed. I'm not gonna be able to decorate for Christmas this year, you know. - Okay. You know what? You've brought so much Christmas spirit into my life. Why don't we just decorate my house? It's gonna be fun. Let me get your jacket. - Oh, thank you. - Here we go. - Hello, sir. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you had company. - Oh, no. Hey, Dominik. We need your help. Get all the Christmas decorations out of the cellar, please. - Christmas decorations? - Yes! We're gonna decorate! - Let's do this. - Go! He's all excited! - Okay! So, what do you think? - I love it. You know, this is the first time I decorated this house without my parents. - You okay? - Yes. I'm super happy. I'm glad you brought some holiday spirit back into this lonely house. Thank you. - Of course. You're forgetting one important thing, though. - What? - Christmas tree. - Oh. We'll save that for tomorrow. - Hey. - Hey. Where you been all day? I thought you just had your dance lesson. - I did. The day got away from us. Do you know how to get to the woods outside of Vienna? - I don't, but I could ask Uncle Markus. Why? - Lukas doesn't have a Christmas tree. Thought I'd surprise him with a real one. What? - You really like him. Yeah, you do! You like him! - Nothing is going on, okay? Stop! I leave for Chicago in a few days. I just want to do something nice for the guy. - Sure. - Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go and iron the only formal dress that I brought so that I can go to the competition tomorrow. - Hm. - Mind your own business. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Wow, they all look so professional. - Don't worry about them. You see the lady in the middle? The other two are sticklers for precision, but she, she judges on chemistry, emotion and overall performance. - So you're saying we actually do have a shot at the Midnight Show and the Christmas Eve Ball? - I sure hope so, or my parents will come back from their grave to haunt me. - Well, looks like we're about to be haunted by a ghost of Christmas past right now. - Good luck. You will need it. Nice dress. - Excuse me... - Why don't you just go sign us in? I'll be with you in a second, okay? - Okay. - Chicago, I hardly recognized you. You've certainly come a long way and I wanted to wish you good luck. - Oh, thank you, but you can't wish me good luck. - Why not? - Because in America, when there's a performance, it's bad luck to wish good luck. - And what do you say instead? - Break a leg. - Right. That makes sense. - Wow! - And now, welcome our next couple, Lydia and Philippe. - Oh... - Ah, Lydia will definitely not be happy with that. - Thank you, Philippe. Thank you, Lydia. And now, please welcome our next couple, Lukas and Amy. - Oh my God. - Oh my God! - Do you want to do this? - No, no. I'm too nervous. You go ahead. I'll be right behind you, okay? - Yes! Yes! We did it! We're going to the Ball! We did it! We're going to the Ball! - Oh! - What happened? Are you okay? - I slipped on this champagne and I think I sprained my ankle. - No. I'm gonna go get an ambulance. - No, no, no, no. It's fine. It's just twisted. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Get a chair or something, please! That's it. - Oh, okay. I am so sorry. - Don't be sorry. It's not your fault. I'm gonna go get you some ice, okay? - Too bad about your dance partner. - Lydia, not now! Come on, please! - You know, Philippe is a great dance partner, but we don't have the same spark that we had. - Lydia... - You saw what he did to me on that lift. You would never embarrass me that way. And I know what winning means to you. You know that there's a rule that allows you to switch dance partner if one gets physically unable to dance? I'm just saying. - I feel so stupid. I can't believe I fell. Lukas and I actually make it into the Midnight Ball and I screw it up with my clumsiness! - Well, at least there's a bright side. - Do tell? - You get to stay here with me. - You have a point. - Sure. - Oh, wow. - Amy insisted you have a real tree sourced from the Vienna woods. - It's beautiful. Merry Christmas. - Now we gotta keep ice on this. - Ow! Ow! Ow! - Look, I don't know. I think that maybe you should go to the doctor. - It'll probably be better in the morning. - If it's still swollen, you promise that you'll go? - I promise. - Who's that? "Hi, Amy. I hope that your ankle is feeling better. "And, by the way, thank you for the tree. It was so thoughtful." That's really sweet. "Are you free tomorrow morning?" I like him. - Give me my phone. I'm glad. It's good that you like him. - Sir, you missed a call from your lady friend. - Thank you, Dominik. It's amazing, isn't it? - "Good morning, Lukas. "Just wanted to let you know I'm on my way "to the hospital right now. Nothing serious. "My ankle's still a little swollen. "So I just want to make sure it's healing properly. "I'm sorry I can't meet up this morning, but I'll call you as soon as I'm done. Bye." - I think we should go to the hospital. - Mm-hmm. I go prepare the car. - Thank you, Dominik. Thank you, Vienna. Not gonna cost a thing. - Thank you for making me go to the doctor. - No problem. Hey, by the way, Uncle Markus said he's gonna stay with us through the holidays to help out. - That's really nice. - Mm-hmm. - The doc said it's just a mild sprain. It should heal pretty quick. - Yeah, well, he insists. Says it's gonna be great to spend Christmas with family again. - That's great. - Yeah, Wunderbar! - All right, let's do this. - Whoa, whoa! What are you doing? You got to stay off of it for at least a couple of days. - Goodbye, Christmas Ball. - Whatever you need, okay? - Thanks. - Hello, Lukas, have you given any more thought to my proposition? - Hey, Lukas, it's Amy. I'm at home recuperating. I'm sorry, again, this has happened. I would really, really love to see you again soon. I know that you are preparing for the Midnight Show, so I totally understand if you're too busy. But, yeah, I hope you're well. Merry Christmas. - Come on, sis. What are you doing back there? We gotta hang stockings. Still nothing? - No, not even a text. - Perfect. - Lukas Hofbauer, nice to see you again! We're about to close, but I can still make you two hot chocolates. - Oh, that would be nice, Sophia, but one only, please. - What happened? - I think I trusted Amy a little too much. She was with someone else the whole time. - I'm sorry. She seemed to like you, the you, you, not the rich, stuffy you. - Yes, I guess you're right. She was...is...different, but it doesn't matter now. I'm back with my ex. I will be dancing in the Midnight Show with her. - Where is she now? - She doesn't like hot chocolate. - All I know is hot chocolate isn't very much fun to drink alone, especially at Christmas. - Hey, are you sure you're gonna be okay at the market? You really should have let Uncle Markus and me come with you. - Daniel, it's fine. How else was I gonna be able to get you both gifts? And I have to get Mom and Dad Christmas gifts. - Okay, but I'm picking you up in an hour. Those crowds are no joke. - I'll be fine. I'll see you in an hour. Bye. - Oh, my gosh. Hey, Amy? - Hey! How are you? - What happened to your leg? - I overdid it in a waltzing competition. - Eee. - Yeah, it's a long story. - Does it hurt? - Yeah, it's still throbbing. - Here. You know I'm a nurse, right? - Yeah. - Here's a bench over here. Let me take a look at it. Let me grab your stuff. - Thanks. - Yeah. Okie-dokie, that should do it. - Wow. That actually feels a lot better. - It's just a minor sprain anyway. - Still, do you think I could dance on it? - It's totally up to you, but it might hurt. Just take a little Ibuprofen and you'll be good to go, though. - I appreciate it, but I don't think I'm gonna be dancing any time soon. Thank you, Hal. - Happy to help. Well, I need to be heading... I actually put my name in a raffle and won tickets to a party tonight. - Cool. - So when do you head back to Chicago? - After Christmas, after my doctor clears me to fly. - Get well soon, Amy. Be well. I'll see you soon. - Have fun. - Good job, guys! Thank you. We will do one last one before our Christmas Eve Ball at Kursalon. Is this all right? - Can I say something? Just because I'm gonna be crowned as the Queen of the Christmas Eve Ball doesn't mean I can't return to my humble beginnings. I want to say that I appreciate every single one of you. I mean, you're all so wonderful. You make us look so good. - Lukas, have you heard from Amy? - Who? - Chicago? The charming American? Quick learner? Feisty spirit? With her, I could have sold classes the whole winter. - You mean the crass, clumsy one with the two left feet who fell? I mean, I hope she's all right. - She's fine. She's well taken care of. - Come on, guys. One more time. - I gotta get back to Chicago. This trip has been such a mess. - Ames, hey, look. I haven't seen you this happy in years. - Do I look happy to you right now? I don't even get to go to the Ball. - Yeah, I know. That wasn't really the point, though, was it? Look, all I'm saying is that I see you happy. You're doing stuff because you want to do it, not because it's on some schedule, not because you feel like you have to. That's a good thing, right? - Why are you always so annoyingly right? - I think I get it from my sister. - My ankle's actually feeling a lot better. - Oh, this is wonderful news. Seems like you've got a late visit from St. Nicholas. - Santa Claus came early. - I would like to give a toast to my new nephew, Daniel, who may not have hunted our Christmas goose in the woods, but, thank goodness, it was still open season at the butcher's! We'll get 'em next year, Daniel, and... to Amy's recovery. You'll be back to waltzing in no time. Prost. - Prost. - What's the matter? - I can't help but think the Ball is tonight and it's setting in that I won't be going. - Hold on a second. You know, I was the head groundskeeper of the palais where the ball is held for over 40 years. - Really? - And for my lifetime of service, every year I'm given these. Brought them along just in case. - What's that? - It's tickets... to the Christmas Ball! - They're yours. Merry Christmas! - Oh, my goodness, Uncle Markus! That's amazing! Thank you so much! - Nothing would give me greater joy than for you to go. - Thank you! I wish I could. I don't have a dress. - Oh, yes, you do. Your dress, my dear. - Is that... - It was Greta's favorite gown. I can think of no one better to wear it. - Oh, my goodness! I would be honored. Thank you, thank you! - Now let's all go to the Ball! - Amazing! I feel like a princess! - I think Greta would be very happy. - Thanks, again, Uncle Markus. I'm so glad you're a part of the family. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - You guys ready to do this? - You look great in a tux. - Oh, thank you. Markus says it was my father's. - You really look like him. - Hopefully, I don't disgrace the family too much with my dancing. - You could never. - Shall we? - We shall. It's magnificent. - Have you ever seen anything so magical? - Only in fairy tales. - A waltz, my dear? - Indeed, good sir. - All right, let's see how those dance lessons paid off. - Hi. My name is Vira. - I'm Daniel. - Nice to meet you. - This is my sister, Amy. - Nice to meet you, too. - Nice to meet you. - I'm gonna get some air. Looks like you have to dance. Good luck. Sorry... Lukas! - Hi, Amy. I didn't expect you here. - Yeah, well, I might have fallen down. But I managed to get myself back up again. - I can certainly see that. How did you manage to get a ticket? - Look, I just want to know what happened. Then you can go back to pretending I never existed! - Hi. I want to say, "Ashley"? You look very classy tonight, A really, really phenomenal dress. But we'd better get going. Let's get some practice before the crown is ours. - Don't let her get to you. - It's not easy. - You should be proud of your dancing. There are not a lot of people who could learn as much as you did in such short time. Thank you, Amy. You helped me remember why I teach waltz in the first place. Excuse me a moment? I have to set up this competition. - Amy! - Hal, what are you doing here? - That party I told you about? This is it! - Wow! Well, you look great. - My mom always told me to pack at least one nice suit because you never know when you're gonna need it. - Looks like she was right. - True. She's been wrong before, though. Hey, this is Eva. Tonight we're having a great time. - Great. Nice to meet you. - Hey, how's your leg? - It's much better, thank you. - I'm very happy you're here tonight. - Thanks. I'm happy that we met here in Vienna. You're a great guy. You guys have a great night, okay? Bye. - Hey. - Have you seen Lukas? - What? Lukas Hofbauer? - Yeah. - Yeah, I... I saw him on the balcony. - Thank you. - Sure. - This is just like in the old days. - Yeah, just like the old days. - Did you ever think we'd be dancing at the Christmas Ball together? - Lydia, I think I need a break. - No! We need to keep practicing! - I'm sorry. Listen... - We need to keep practicing! - I need to get some fresh air! - Lukas? Please, why won't you talk to me? What's your problem? - My problem? - Ever since I got hurt, you've completely blown me off! - Excuse me? - I mean, I get it. You just wanted to be crowned King of the Ball. But you could have at least said thank you and goodbye! - Hey, listen! I came to see you! I just didn't know you were with someone else. - Someone else? What are you talking about? There is no one else! - Yeah, right. I know what I saw. You know, with girls like Lydia, I know what I'm getting. She's not just pretending to be nice, to be clawing her way to the top just like all the other ones! - Is that what you think of me? - Without further ado, the moment we all have been waiting for. - Let's win this crown. - Please welcome our Midnight Show dancers. - I knew you'd come around. - Please welcome our final waltzing couple. - I'm glad you came to your senses. You would never won that crown with her. - Hey. - Hey. - Is everything okay? - No. I'm sorry. - What is he doing? - What are you doing? - Lydia, you deserve to dance with somebody who wants the crown as badly as you do. - But this has been your dream for years! - I need to do this for myself. I can't live my life for everybody else. This is it! Amy, I am so sorry. - Lukas, I...I... - I never planned on meeting you. But now that I have, I can't imagine my life any other way. - I don't know. I don't know, Lukas. - I'm sorry for what I said outside. I didn't mean it. It was out of hurt. I just needed to let you know how I truly feel. Listen, take good care of her, okay? You're a lucky man. - Wait. You think Daniel's my boyfriend? - Ah, no... - Daniel's my brother. - What? Daniel is your brother? - Yeah. - Amy is your sister? - Yeah. - You guys are brother and sister? - Yeah! - Yes. - No! That's amazing! I mean, I'm such a fool! - Yeah. - Yeah. - I didn't want to get hurt again. Could you ever forgive me? I am so sorry. - You could start by asking me to dance. - May I have this dance? - Yes. - This is beautiful. - I thought it was dangerous to look your partner in the eyes. - Not if she is as beautiful as you are. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Chicago! - It's the best Christmas Ball ever! - Shall we dance? - Love to.
