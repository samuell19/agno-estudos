Oh. Hi. Hi. Now the holiday has started. Ma'am? Your carriage awaits. Sir. Wow... Onward, James! I found the one. We did it! She is going to love this. Isn't it great? Yup, perfect. Whoa, hey there. Are you okay? Donna? Donna! What... Charlie? It's a miracle you're alive. We'll never have a family now. Hey... We're going to have each other. We'll be each other's family. How can I help? I thought maybe I'd just... Give everything to a shelter. I feel like it's the only way I'm going to get through this, is by helping others. I think I know how we can do it. A bookstore? Where people can go, and... And disappear, or choose a bigger life, or... Heal. And move forward from the pain of the past. To the promise of tomorrow. Yeah. A bridge. That's what we'll call it. The bridge. Love it. Are you kidding me? Are you seeing this? This is amazing. People will come, stay, connect to something. This could be our home. Our family. Ah-hah. Oh, good. Watch this. Ah... That's more like it. Perfect. Yeah? Come and see. I love it. Here you go, sir. Grand opening tomorrow. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Tomorrow, we open that door, and we welcome in the rest of the world, but today... Come here. Today, it's still... Just our dream come true. What do you think, my heart? Who will walk through those doors tomorrow? Dad, we agreed that if you want me to come back and take over the place, I get to go away to college, and I get to choose my own courses. Sweetheart I only have your... ...best interests at heart, I know. I'm six hours by plane. I'm used to having you down the hall. Yeah. Just you and me against the world. You know, there is this new technology, I don't know if you've heard of it, it's called a cell phone, so you could just... - That whole thing. - All right. Yeah. That'll be Ronnie. Well, actually, I, um... Preston. Ta-dah! Oh, wow. Business cards. Thanks, Preston. "Molly callens, future ceo," see? Hi, Mr. callens. Thanks for the invite. How are you? Wait. I told you. I can't, but thanks. Is that Molly's course book? I suggested macroeconomics. There's also a global business course. Ooh, global business, I like it. Global business, yeah. I'm jumping out of my skin. You really should let him take you to the airport. No. Ronnie's taking me to the airport. Ronnie... Yeah, Ronnie, my best friend for the last 300 years? Cute, funny... She's always right on time. Yeah. Excuse me. - Hi. - Hey. We need to go before my dad decides he wants to be my roommate, too. Oh, dad's in fine form, huh? He's driving me crazy. Okay. Hey, Preston. I'll get the bags. I can do that. I'll do it. Hey, Ronnie. Hey, Mr. callens. Oh, Molly... No distractions. No sororities, no frat parties, no drinking, no late nights... Dad... And no boys. If you need anything, the duffys are in the house. They've got a direct line to me. I have a direct line to you. You do. Yeah. Hey, mol'? We did okay, yeah? Yeah, we did great. Your mother would be really proud of you. But just one... business course? Dad! Look, it's still you and me against the world. It's just a couple more Miles between us. I'll call every Sunday, like I promised. Maybe the occasional Tuesday. - Love you. - I love you, too. Hi. Thanks. You're going to do great. Thanks. I'm gonna go. Okay. Drive safe, Ronnie. Hey. Hey... What is it? I just, I don't even have a major. Maybe I should have gone to Stanford like my dad wanted, and... And let him make the decisions for the rest of your life, too? I'd know what comes next. You chose 3,000 Miles away so you could see what it was like to live without someone over your shoulder. You're in charge. That means you could be anything. Who will you be when no one is looking? Sorry! This place goes a little catty-wampus on the first day. Sorry. Catty-who? Wampus. You're not from around here, are you? Seattle. Never heard of it. Are you serious? It's up, it's in the northwest... Yeah. Right, okay, yeah. Well, you look out for those pickup trucks, unless they don't have them in... Where are you from again? - Seattle? - Oh. Yeah. Seattle. I'd like to sign up for... ...Music appreciation? Music major. Stepping out of my comfort zone. Nice. Can I get... ...19th-century literature? Now I'm stepping out of my comfort zone. Okay. You're not taking macroeconomics, too? Macro... No. That is way too far out of my comfort zone. Okay. I'm all registered, just all that's left now is books. My favorite part. Campus bookstore? It's too bad there isn't another place we can at least get the 19th-century lit books. What, like a real bookstore? Yeah, is there one nearby? - What? - You trust me? Trust you? I don't even know your name. Ryan. Ryan Kelly. Hey... shoot. - Thanks. - I got it. Sorry. And you are? Molly. Callens. - Yeah - hey. Want to head out? This is it. Okay. Wait'll you meet Charlie and Donna, who run the place. Most amazing couple ever. You'll love it, you'll see. "The bridge." I don't see... Oh, I know where it is, come on. Here it is. You... Are going to love this. I promise. Here you go. Coffee crumble, two raspberry scones. Enjoy. - Hi, Luther. - Hey, Donna. I think you promised to bring some of your specialties to taste? I do soul food, not dessert. Well, I can't sell soul food, but we can eat it. Come on, Sunday brunch with Charlie before we open? We'll host. Done. Yes! I can't wait. See you Sunday. What... Sunday? Yeah, taste tests for Luther's future catering company. We are lucky people. Ah-ah! Those are for customers! I can't resist. N-n-n... Hey, how goes constitutional law? Slow. Try a cupcake. I think that'll help. Hey! "Freddy and the dreamers." How's our favorite landlord? Donna just made some fresh cupcakes. There's one for each of you, it's on the house. Come on, go. Go! Come on, buddy. The young adolescent at it again? All I can say is, thank goodness for this place. It's our escape. You know what I think? Science fiction. It's a world he can disappear into. Oh, and uh, have a cupcake. You look like you could use one. Ah, music man! The great Charlie bartons. I'd like to introduce Molly... Callens. Welcome, Molly callens. Are you new to belmont? Yeah. Yeah, uh, new to the South, actually. But you've traveled a lot. Out of the country even. Yeah, how did you know? And you're a sports fan. You prefer sweet to salty, and your favorite books as a child were the little house series? Charlie is a magician. Well... Charlie bartons, are you giving away cupcakes again? Oops, gotta run. Oh, hey, hey, you didn't see me. Got it. Pinky swear. Hey, Bert. Huh? Yup. Ryan Kelly. Hey... Weren't you going after Charlie? Ah, I know where he lives. Who's this? This is Molly callens. Hi. She's from Seattle. She's not very good at parking lots, loves bookstores, and has a weakness for all things Southern. I made that last one up. You guessed right. Well, it's very nice to meet you, Molly. I'm Donna, Charlie's partner in crime. Welcome to the bridge. Thank you. Come on, let me show you the best part. Okay. Bye. You're going to love it. Okay. It's like my dad's library, only better. Your father works at a library? No, I... Never mind. It's somewhere I've gone to escape before. So, yeah, I'm gonna need a lot of help with 19th-century lit. Well, I am definitely going to need someone to carry me through music appreciation. If only we had someplace to study. You can just stop here, this is good. You... Live in the woods. You're a nymph? I mean... that might explain a lot, but... No, I didn't get enough exercise today and this is the perfect amount for the walk I need. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. All right. Yes, dad, I did sign up for macroeconomics, those lit classes that i told you about before. I look both ways before I cross the street, my mittens are attached to my jacket, and I promise that I will sleep at naptime. Very funny. You want me to put a video camera on my shoulder so you can just follow me everywhere I go? Yeah, that'd be great. Rae Ann's here. She can vouch for me. Rae Ann, tell my dad I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do. It's real, Mr. callens. Molly's shooting straight. See? I arrived safe. My schedule is complete. I'm unpacked. Rae Ann testified under oath that I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do. More details, please. Uh, there's not much more to tell. Classes start tomorrow. Uh, I did find a really good place to study. Oh, speaking of which, that's my study partner, so I'm going to let you go... Study partner already? Can I... Bye, dad. I love you. I'll call you soon. Hello? Hey, it's Ryan, from belmont and the bridge. Yeah. Long time no see. Um, I just realized that both of us have classes that get out at 3:00, and since you're new to Franklin, and we probably won't have too much work, I thought maybe I could show you around. Tomorrow? You bet. Well... Great. Uh... I'll... I'll see you then. Cool. Bye. Hey, mom. Dinner at 6:00? Oh. Yeah. Um, yeah, I'm on it. Who was on the phone? Nobody. Dinner in 15. Everything okay? Everything is really great. Okay... There you go. Oh, almost forgot. Pick a bookmark. How about this one? - Like it? - Thanks. And please, come back when you're done. I really want to know what you think. I'm Donna. I own the store with my husband, Charlie. Edna. Thank you very much. No, thank you. So, most people head straight for Nashville, but Franklin is really hitting its stride. It's gotten five times larger in the last 30 years. Well, it's not Seattle, but... Where is that again? I think you might need to be taking geography. Probably. Probably... This entire are was a giant battlefield during the civil war. Over 6,000 soldiers died. But if you want something lighter, they have a pumpkin festival every Halloween, and a bluegrass one in the spring. Hmm. You would not believe the players that show up, they are ridiculous, and at night, they descend on a club called lucky's, where all the greats have played. They try out new material, and people get discovered. Like you? Me? At lucky's? No way. What? Isn't that what you're getting a music degree for? To set the world on fire? "Ring of fire." "Come on baby, light my fire." Okay, okay... - "Great balls of fire." - I get it, I get it. "We didn't start the fire." Sorry. I'm just saying, if I'm gonna be ceo of my father's company when I'm 25, the least you can do is... What? Nothing. It's just the way that music can change your entire mood, say things that you've never even had words for, but... But even more that that, it's like this... What? Okay, what is music to you? It's what I was born to do. I'm rambling, aren't I? Wow, um... You look bored. Is it boring? - No. - No? Not bored at all? - No, no. - Okay. I was... I was just thinking that you're really lucky to know what you're supposed to do. I mean, you do, too. You're gonna be ceo of your dad's company by the time you're 25, and... Wait. Molly callens. Seattle... Is that callens media? - Yup. - Wow. You're... Really rich. No, no, no. Yeah. Man, and you're gonna be taking over by the time you're 25? You must feel the same way about business as I do about music. You'll be some billionaire big shot and I'm gonna be in the suburbs of Nashville. In your giant country home from all your records... - Teaching. - ...Record sales. What, teaching? I'm doing a music education double major. That way, I can wind up with something steady, and take care of the people who took care of me. I mean, I really think it's the greatest gift of all to make a living off of something that you love, don't you? Yeah, I think that sounds amazing. Well, that's what we'll do, I'll do music, and you'll do business. Okay. Um... Are you finished? Yeah. Let's go. Oh, man... You know, I really don't think you need this much exercise. Just let me take you... No, it's okay. I spend all my time on the computer, reading. I mean, it's getting late, though. I don't mind. Thanks again. Welcome. That. During the renaissance, the bassoon was a brand-new instrument, and composers were making new sounds. The whole world was breaking wide open. What? Nothing. You're going to make a really amazing teacher. You know what I could really use right now? Your favorites. And Donna is coming with some... Study-sized caffeine. Thank you. No cream, 45 sugars. Your usual. Mm, you know me so well. Are we okay with me being awake for the next three weeks? Well, there are 900 pages left in "jude the obscure," which, if he's so obscure, why does he need 900 pages? Why are these books so long? Well, they were serialized, in magazines. They were, like, the 1800s version of TV. And then, they were cheap, so people who didn't really read before got sucked in. Now who's the teacher? Okay, come on, a hundred more pages, and then maybe we can watch the movie as a reward. Wait. There's a movie? Mm-hmm. Come on. "Jane eyre's" next, it's my favorite. Cheers. Two months. I am never wrong about love. Here we are. Oh, man. Okay, seriously, why do I have to park so far away from where you actually live? What, you're married? You have five kids? Turn into a werewolf at midnight? Yeah, yeah, that's... Come on. Look, it's, um... My dad is overprotective, and he rented me a house in Franklin because he doesn't want me in the belmont dorms. They're distracting. Hang on, you live in an entire house by yourself? No, no, there's a groundsman and a housekeeper. There's a groundsman and housekeeper for... How dirty are you? No! No, no, no, no, it's not like that. He just wants me to stay in the house, and-and work... In some big mansion. No, please... It's, just, it's just a place off-campus. Because... I'm the distraction, or...? No, no. No, he doesn't even know about you. Thanks. Ow! Ow... You okay? Yeah. Here's your bag. Thanks. My mom died when I was seven, so, it's just been me and my dad for as long as I can remember, and he really, really needs me to... Follow the rules? I'm really sorry about your mom. It's not just that. He really does have my best interests at heart. He can just be a little... opinionated about what he wants me to pursue. Is that why you're going to take over his company? Is that what he wants you to do? I don't know. He's so smart. Everything he's ever pushed me to do has turned out amazingly, and I don't have this burning passion for music like you do... So, you'll just let him drive your life? I'm sorry, it's just... Forget about what your dad wants for one second. What would you do, if you could do anything at all? That's the thing, I don't know. I don't know, and if I don't know, then what he's offering is... Amazing. Yeah. But is it right? Right for you? "I would do anything for you, sir. Anything that was right." It's from "Jane eyre," the next one. Your favorite. Mm-hmm. Look, I don't mean to... It's just that I've got this video for media class, "what will you be doing in 10 years?" And it's been... Awful... ...trying to put it together, but it's... It's good to ask the questions, right? Yeah. Yeah, it is. I just, uh... Wish I had the answers. Yeah. - I gotta go. - Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, stranger. Kristen, what are you doing here? Drove home for the weekend. Want to grab some dinner? Yeah, sure. That'd be great. So, I needed a break, faces I've known longer than two months, someone to do my laundry. So, a two-hour drive and presto. So... what about you? How's it going? Good. Good, yeah. Um, it's tougher than I expected. 19th-century lit is killing me. 19th... who? You're... what? I know, I know, I stepped outside of my comfort zone. Listen to you. So, um... The million-dollar question. I've been thinking about you. Me too. I can't tell you how hard it's been to not pick up the phone. Yeah, it's weird, huh? It's so weird. It's so weird to not have you across the street, or in biology. I was thinking maybe... We could shift the agreement? Or maybe just be in touch more? Because maybe it's hard for us to figure out what we really want without talking. You know? I think, um... I need some more time to be apart. You know, keep it like this, if that's okay. Yeah. Yeah, of course. We said until Christmas, so I wouldn't want to spring myself... No, no, I mean, it's your home, you can bring your laundry... I didn't come for my laundry, ry. You get that, right? I came to see you. Yeah. More coffee? Oh, I'll float away. I should have left an hour ago, but your recommendations have been so good. This one made me laugh. I needed that. Wait, do you work? I never asked. I do medical billing, not far away. I was going to quit at Thanksgiving. I got married last Thanksgiving. Oh, well, that's wonderful. Isn't it? Tom and I were high school sweethearts. Then he joined the army and went overseas, until about a year and a half ago, when he was stationed at fort Campbell nearby. We fell hard again. And then in December, on his last tour... Oh, no. We'd only been married three weeks. Oh... I can't imagine what you must be going through right now, but, you know, I... I do know what it's like when life turns out differently than you expected, so... I'm just, um... I'm so sorry. You're not supposed to cry when someone's being kind to you. Oh, are you kidding me? That's the best time to cry. Can I hug you? You know what, you need a hug. I just have to hug you. Here I come. Okay, you know what, I have another one for you. I know you're still in the middle of this, but it's just something about it... It's the Clara barton biography. I mean, it's brand-new. The nurse who founded the red cross? How did you know? I've been working in medical administration so long, but... What I've always really wanted to do is nursing. Well, lookie there. That's the gift of the bridge. Right? Connecting. As we turn to the second chapter of "jude the obscure," where we'll discuss jude's unfortunate upbringing. Hey. I've been reading about bookstores going out of business. What makes us special? Talk to me. What's going on? E-readers, they're not slowing down, and magazines, and newspapers are going to be on them soon, along with writers who can self-publish straight to websites. This could wipe out books. Honey... Nothing is going to wipe out books. I don't know. People are buying more and more downloads. I mean, they're browsing on computers instead of going into a store. We have to counter that with more than just... Faith. Well, what should we do? That's just it. I don't know yet. Look... I'm going to go to church tomorrow. Charlie... Come with me. It's where I get my best thinking done. It's a place of peace. Where there's time and space to... to breathe, and figure things out. Just this one time. Come on. Okay. After closing, a movie? There's another cheesy action flick at the carmike. Now, that's more like it. You're getting the popcorn. So, in your 10-year plan, here's you with kids... And this is an... Interesting house. Here's Franklin, and here's you playing music, a lot. So... Ry? I'm here for my education degree. But you can't find a place for it. I'm supposed to be a teacher. Say it. What if... The 10-year plan in my head right now is different than it's been for years? Is that what's happening? Just forget the video for a minute, just tell me. I want to write songs. I've been writing songs. You have? They're not any good, but... Ry', of course they are. You don't know. Yes, I do. Of course, they are... Do you know how many people try to make it in this business? I'd be just one more broke musician. Or you'll be amazing, and you'll succeed beyond your wildest dreams. I mean, if this is what you really want to do, and you pursue it... What if in 10 years you've written the music, and taken that chance? How can I go back and tell my mom she's paying for a college education so I can go out and be some... performer? If that's what you really want to do? Could you tell your dad you don't want to run his company? No. That's completely different. How? Because you've been mad passionate about music for how long now? As long as I can remember. Exactly. You can't back off, not now. You have to do this. You have to tell her. Okay. I want to make a deal with you. I'll try and figure out a way to pursue my music if you start figuring out what you really want. 'Cause it's your choice, too, who you become in 10 years. But you have to start now. Will you? So, we hold each other accountable? Being exactly who we want to be. Within 10 years, become who we want. Our choice. Step outside of... ...Our comfort zone. Because I think you could be really amazing. What are you doing on Thanksgiving? I'm going home on Thursday. Why? Come over to my house on Wednesday night. Have a home-cooked meal with my mom. I mean, not that she cooks, but... You cook? Only if I wanted to survive. Mol'? You want me to meet your mother? I think you guys would hit it off. You'd get to know her, and... Maybe someday you can introduce me to your dad. Yeah. Mol...? Yeah... Yeah. Yeah. Day before Thanksgiving. Meet your mom. I'd love to. Great. Great. So, any plans for Thanksgiving plans, Fred? We're having our annual dinner. The boys and I were going to spend it at home together. Hmm. Who's cooking? Horrible idea. Luther? Four more for the table. You got it. We'll expect you at 3:00. How goes the job hunt? Let's not talk about it. None of the three callback interviews panned out. Your billing service does some work for a law firm, too, doesn't it? Next door. I think they're still looking for summer associates. If you like, I can ask. Yes, please. Whoa. Hey, Bert! It's just... Never mind. Okay, um... First kiss? No way. Prom date? Come on, there's got to be a childhood sweetheart, something. Kristen. Her name was kristen. Ooh... Kristen's a pretty-girl name. Okay, what about you? Who's yours? Uh, there's this guy, Preston, but it's not... "Preston." Of course. A rich boy's name. Preston what? Millington the third. Stop. Stop it! Stop. Hey, wait, wait, wait. That's it, isn't it? Lucky. That club you were talking about. Yeah. Yeah? Well, 10 years or less, that's where you're going to be. Let's film in front of it. - Molly... - Come on, come on. No, no... It's perfect. Ry', you said. Okay. Look... If you want to make these things happen, you have to say them out loud. Come on. Go. Okay. Within 10 years, I'd like to play at that club, have my music there, and be considered in the company of those who have been there. Now you. No. Hey, why? Come on. Stop. Stop it. Come on, we've got to say stuff out loud. It's your turn. It's your video. Yeah, but you'll be in my life in 10 years, so... So, what do you think? What? Say it. Say it right now. I don't think I want to run my dad's company, and... I'm not even sure I want to stay in Seattle. Molly. I can't believe I just said that. But is it true? Everything's changing. Is that a bad thing? Shoot, what time is it? We've been doing this all day. I have midterms, I have to study. I have to go. All right, well, let me give you a ride. Home? Actually, the bridge? - Yeah. - Okay. Molly? Hey. Hi. I, um... My mom read the first one to me out loud when I was little and then my dad bought the whole set. I hadn't thought about them until Charlie said something. I came to pick them up. I'm not exactly sure why. Your mom must miss you being away. You have any brothers and sisters? Mm-mm. Well, I'm sure your parents are very proud. You know, I came to belmont to get the education that I'd always wanted, but... Got more than you bargained for? Yeah. College can be like that. Is it about being away from home? Uh, no... Well, a bit, but it's... Is it about Ryan? Is it that obvious? For him, too. Hmm. My mom actually died when I was seven, really unexpectedly. She, um... She was diagnosed with lung cancer, and then seven weeks later... Honey. Honey... My dad dove into his work. He's really overprotective of me, and telling me what my life should be. He's trying to hold on to you. Really tight. I'm sure you remind him of her. Yeah. I love him, I really do. I just... What if the life that I want and the life that he wants for me just don't... I mean, I don't even know how to say it. Respecting those that love you is very important, but you know as well as anyone, that things can change in the blink of an eye. So when you find passion, for a person, or a life that you always dreamt of... You just can't back up. Don't give up on something so rare. It's scary. Terrifying. But you can do it. Hmm? Thanks. Do you remember the beginning with us? Molly was in the store today, alone. Ah. She's like this hummingbird, you know? Everything just shimmering right on the surface. Do I remember... We're still that age. In your dreams. Come with me to church tonight. Come on, you believe so much. Just listen to how you invest. You act on your faith every day, just admit it. The bridge is my ritual, my tradition. It's... Okay, it's my connection to doing good in the world. It's my family. I have everything I need with you and the bridge. I'll get it! You must be Molly. Come in, come in! I've heard so much about you. I'm kristen. Kristen. Kristen is home on break earlier than I thought. Kristen, this is Molly, my... Study partner. This is kristen... Uh, childhood sweetheart. Hi. Come on in. And I see someone was raised with manners. Jeanette, something for you! And of course, it's more than some girl he went to prom with. They've been a couple since they were 11, and I had to sit there while she recounted all the hilarious things that happened while they were growing up. I mean... Oh, honey. Why I let you talk me into thinking this was something more. Just 'cause I have feelings doesn't mean that... And thank God she was there when I got there. Can you imagine? I admit I really like him, and then boom. Hello, girlfriend. What did Ryan say? What could he say? You didn't give him a chance to explain? It's not like anything's going on. Just because you don't admit them out loud doesn't mean you don't have feelings. They're your feelings. What if he's the kind of guy that's "on" with whatever girl he's with? What if he has other girls in other classes? What if he likes you as much as you like him, and kristen is his Preston? That face? That's the one. Wow. Thanks for the support. Anytime. Come in. Hey. You left these on the table. Been busy, huh? Yeah. I can't, uh... Seem to stop writing. That's good, right? What? I always thought I'd end up in Franklin... Be with kristen, and teach, like you. And now? Teaching's steady, dependable. And kristen... ...is also steady and dependable. Ry... Do you think I would ever want you to have a life that you could describe as "steady" or "dependable"? I just wanted to take care of you for once. Don't tell me that's why you signed on to teach? It's why you did... To take care of me. No! Ryan, teaching was my life raft. My life expectation was that I would marry and raise a family. The end. Maybe I'd travel, go to Italy one day. That was my dream. Then, when your dad left, you were so little. I had to go to work. But, teaching... Teaching made me happy... Every single day. That's all I've ever wanted for you. And, ry... Honey, I took care of you because I love you, and it's made me genuinely happy. And if you don't go out and chase your own dreams after all that... Honestly, what was it all for? Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. If we're gonna be ready for people, I'd better start chopping. Okay. Okay, you can chop and you can stir, and you can set the table. - Mm-hmm? - But anything past that... Mm! - See? - Mm-hmm. Donna refuses to decorate the tree before Thanksgiving, but... ..."Once Thanksgiving day starts..." Okay, so I prefer Christmas to any other holiday, so sue me. Who wants to help me, fellas? Come on! That's it! Come over here. Grab one and put it up there! That's it. ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells jingle all the way ♪ ♪ oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh ♪ ♪ hey! ♪ ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells jingle all the way... ♪ Oh, thanks. Come on, seahawks! Pull it together! You see that? Not a good season for your boys, huh? Let's not talk about it. You look great. The food's really good. Well, I had 'em make all your favorites. Oh, and I made a reservation at ning wah tomorrow. My favorite hole-in-the-wall Chinese! Thought you hate that place? I do. But you love it. And it's close to the office, so I thought maybe we could... - Dad. - What? You sure you're okay? Your phone calls are short, but you seem... Yeah. Classes are challenging, but the people are incredibly nice, so. You making friends there? I talk to Ronnie on the phone. Oh, and I found this bookstore called the bridge. It's run by this amazing older couple... What about... didn't you have a study partner? Ryan! Yeah. Yeah. He grew up in Franklin, so he knows the town really well. He and his girlfriend grew up next to each other. Hey, mol! Hi, Preston. I can't stay, my parents are expecting me, but wade insisted. "Wade" now, huh? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. I've been spending weekends at the office. I'll be there on Christmas break too, so you and I can... I... ...spoiled the surprise. I'm going to have you come by the office, get your hands dirty over the long Christmas break. And I got something special to show you there tomorrow. Come have a bite. Remember when we set you up with a kid's desk and office toys? Yeah. This will be waiting for you, every summer and every break. You like it? Yeah, I love it. Thanks. Come on, let's take you shopping. Really? I love black Friday. I could actually... I could use a new pair of... At the office supply store. - Oh. - Come on. Hey! Don't want to be late for movie night. Yeah, I'll be right there. I skipped our Thanksgiving weekend movie ritual. I don't know what's going on with me. Things are changing. Everything I thought three months ago... I'm so grateful for everything that I have... How did you know that Donna was "the one"? I have watched you and Molly together. You already know. Just like I knew. Right? Right? It's very obvious. Talk to you? I am so sorry. You don't think, that maybe in the future, we could...? I can't imagine you not being in my life. You mean the world to me. And I want to stay as close to you as I possibly can... But not the way I want. Um... I'm just gonna, uh... Have a good, uh... Kristen. Have a good holiday. Bye, Ryan. - Hello? - Donna? Hi. It's Molly callens. I hope I'm not calling too late. No! No, not at all. Is everything okay? Yeah. I just wanted, uh... I really missed the bookstore today. And... And Franklin. Is that stupid? I guess that's really all I called to say. Well, I think that's the perfect reason. It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas around here. How's Seattle? It's good. You remember feeling that deeply for each other? When everything was changing and you were about to crack into something? They have it for each other. And they have it because of each other. Mm. And the bridge. And the bridge. Because of the bridge! Charlie... Remember how we talked about finding a way to counter technology and what's coming down the pike? Yeah. I think our two friends may have just showed us what that is. People come here for the camaraderie, right? A book recommendation from a trusted source. Right? Yeah. Uh... found it! This is perfect for the long plane ride to visit the grandkids. Enjoy it. Coffee made just their way. Homemade food. Savory gingerbread... Try it. Okay. Mm! You make that here, we will absolutely sell it. That is good! - We offer so much more. - Yeah. Something downloads can't give you. A whole experience, reasons to come back. Yeah. Yeah. Because... the people. Yes! That's what folks can't get online. Huh? The connections that make being in a store feel... Like a "must." So we capitalize on that, right? We bring in local authors to do a reading. Oh, yeah, authors who'd bring their friends and family, might be new to the place. Or what about an open Mike night for poetry? - Or musicians. - Yes! I know tons of artists in Nashville who would love to try out their new stuff. We meant you. Think about it. Huh? "The bookstore unplugged." Acoustic. That is brilliant! - I need a pen and paper. - Okay. Wait. You're a genius. Hey. Hey. I just wanted to, uh... Good morning, everyone. As you'll recall, last time, we were finishing off our discussion of pre-postmodern auteur theory, and today, we will discuss... Hey, will you hop in? I can't. Seriously! Just get in. Look, I'm really behind, okay? I can't. Mol, will you please talk to me? What? I've known kristen since I was six. She was my best friend from across the street. You really don't have to explain. It's okay. She was there for me when my dad left. And I was there through her brother's deployment after 9/11. When it came time for college, we said we were gonna separate and see if we really wanted to be together, or if it was just out of habit. I've never had any other kind of relationship, and I've never met anybody... Okay, I get it, okay? Until you. Kristen's the past. You... I'm in the middle of writing a song for you. I mean, it's not done, and I'm not sure if it's... If it's any good or not, but... I never wrote anything for kristen. You wrote me a song? I've written, like, 12 songs since we met. I mean, it's practically all that I do. And over Thanksgiving break, I told kristen I thought our break should be permanent. I just... I don't want the life that I thought I did anymore. I want... I want... Charlie and Donna have this new idea for the bridge, to help bring people in. They're featuring local artists, authors, bakers, setting up for one big night to kick it off a few nights before Christmas. I thought maybe we could help 'em put it together? Yeah. Yeah. I mean... They'll probably need musicians, too. Right? Maybe a local musician who loves the bookstore so much and should totally perform there in public? I've got a job for you, if you're still looking. Agent. Well, let's see. I'd really only want one client. Oh... I wish it could be Christmas always. Yes! Yes! Lord, that is so good! Hey, Bert. You have to try these. They are fabulous! Did you paint all of these? Yeah, that's the one van gogh wishes he painted. Will you relax? You're gonna be great. I promise. Thank you. I wrote this song for one special person, but it's perfect for a place like this, because we all have "a story to tell," because, uh, that's the title of the song. Okay, so...

Actually, it's Preston. I'm calling from your dad's office. - I have news. - Oh. I start at callens media as soon as I graduate. Isn't that great? Mol? Yeah. Yeah. That's so great. Congratulations, Preston. You're perfect for the company. Now our future's all mapped out. You and I'll be working together and... You know. Hey, maybe I'm not meant to run the company. Maybe I'll, uh, maybe I'll stay in Tennessee. Don't be ridiculous. Of course, you'll come home. Preston... Look, you're the best. I mean it. And... I love you, Preston. I always have... As a friend. Only ever as a friend. Look, I'm sorry. You should be celebrating. You've wanted to work there forever, and you're perfect for the job. I'll be in Seattle on Wednesday, and then we can be together, talk more. Okay? Preston? I think... ...that once you're away from Tennessee, you'll see what's here. Your dad will show you what your future is, like always. And you'll come home. I know it. I'll see you soon. Bye. Mm! This is so good. Are you sure music is your calling? You're just biased. Mm-mm! You can cook for me anytime. Maybe I will. Cheers. Cheers. It's snowing. It's beautiful. Pretty great, huh? I'm so full. I may never eat again. So, it's kind of hard to put a bow around an envelope, but... I didn't get you anything. Well, it's okay. Yeah. Please. The line from " Jane eyre"... As soon as you mentioned it, I knew it was a song title. And you wrote it? My first one. - It's for you. - Ooh! Where's your guitar? Right now. Right now! You have to play it. I will, I will, but first, there's... There's more. Come on. Okay. All right. I finished the video. It's your copy. I used the song to score it. I couldn't have done it... Any of it... without you. Okay... wrap the cookies in wax paper whenever they cool off. And don't eat 'em all. I'm expecting some tomorrow when I take you to the airport. Perfect breakfast. And, mol... Hmm? Watch the video. Okay? Okay. Ything for you ♪ ♪ anything that is right ♪ ♪ I would go anywhere with you ♪ ♪ long as you're by my side ♪ ♪ you've captured my heart ♪ In 10 years, I'd like to have played at that club.

Stop it! - Yeah. - Why? Because you'll be in my life in 10 years, so... What do you think? What? Say it. Say it right now. Ryan Kelly? Help you? I represent jessie Taylor. He saw you sing at the bridge the other night. Jessie tay... The j... Please! Come in. He was very impressed. We've had a backup guitar player fall out of his upcoming U.S. tour, last minute. I got your address from the couple that runs that bookstore. Yeah. Jessie was wondering if you could sub in. It starts after the first of the year, so you'll need to knock out the paperwork quick. The pay's good... Th-the first of the year... That means I'd have to drop out of school, and be away from... Well, when would you need to know by? You can't tell me "yes" or "no" now? I can't believe I'm asking you this, but is there any way I could let you know tomorrow? You got guts, I'll give you that. But you also got jessie's attention, so you get one day. My number's on that card. After that, I gotta move on. Well... can you let Mr. Taylor know how much I appreciate this? He already knows. Here's your chance, kid. Don't blow it. Thank you! Sorry. I'm leaving right now. You will not believe what just happened. Ryan? This is wade callens. I'm... Molly's father. I understand that you and Molly have been studying together. I also understand that this relationship might be developing into something more. Sir? Molly has a path that she's on. You need to leave her alone. With all due respect, I know Molly... "Know?" You met her, what, three months ago? She's coming back to Seattle to work for me, - and... - Sir... And she's going to marry Preston millington. That's... that's impossible. If Molly was engaged, she would have told me. Molly spoke to him yesterday. She told him that she loved him and she was looking forward to being in Seattle with him. I'm sorry, sir. I spent yesterday with your daughter, and... Except for one phone call, right? That came from you. From my office. Preston was here accepting a job I'd offered him. If you don't believe me... Take a listen. I love you, Preston. I always have. I'll be in Seattle on Wednesday and then we can be together... Talk more. Preston and Molly are going to work together and be married. The life Molly is supposed to have. The one that she has chosen. Be realistic. What could you possibly offer Molly? Aren't you just a musician? Do the right thing, Ryan. Merry Christmas. Thanks. Ry? Did I do something wrong? No. No. Ryan! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Wait. Merry Christmas. Hey, listen, about... About last night. I shouldn't have kissed you. I really need to apologize. I mean, you have your whole life in Seattle, and I have my life here, so, you know, we're friends. Right. Yeah... No. I shouldn't have crossed the line. It was a mistake. Actually, yeah, I might be dropping out of belmont. You're... wait! What are you saying. Jessie Taylor, uh, he saw me at the bridge thing. Jessie tay... Are you joking? - That's amazing! - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. He wants me as his backup guitarist for his U.S. tour. It's, um, it starts in early January, so. Okay. I... I don't understand. So I spoke to kristen last night. Um... We're gonna make a go of it. You spoke to her last night? After... But you wrote me a song, and... Your video. Why are you saying these things? Kristen and I, um... You know, we have more in common. Same background, same... Hey, you know, it's better we figure this out between us now anyway, right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I get it. Um... Wow. Well, I hope you two are... Both very happy together. Uh, Molly, wait. You forgot this. Keep it. Hey. It's okay. Sorry, we're closed. What? Oh! Merry Christmas! I knew you'd be here. Is Charlie at church already? No, he's in the back, getting ready to leave. You didn't have to get me anything. Of course I did. That's what friends do. And it's only because of you I've been able to pick my head up these last few months. And do this other thing... I signed up for nursing school. What? Edna! I know! I start in January. It's night school, so it's gonna take some time, but... I'm doing it. I am so proud of you. I never would've done it if I hadn't have met you or Charlie. Or found this place. Oh! Open it. Oh, edna... Look inside. "Love is the only thing we can carry with us when we go, and it makes the end so easy." "Little women." Look at the next one. "It's only with the heart that we can see rightly. What is essential is invisible to the eye." Oh, "little prince." That is so Luther! What you and Charlie have created on the heels of your loss... It inspired me. You know... I'd like to think our daughter knows what she inspired... In us, so many years ago. You know what? Do you mind? I need to catch Charlie. - Of course. Go! - Okay. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Wait! Charlie! Donna? Something wrong? I do have faith. Are you...? You're right. I've always had faith. In you. You're the one I turn to when I need comfort, when I need reassurance that things are gonna turn out okay, because they always do. With you. Wow. That's sweet. So... Are you coming to church? No. I just... I just wanted to tell you. Thank you. Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! It's Christmas Eve. Our tradition. One present. Open it. Your mother wanted you to have it as a college graduation gift, but I thought... I don't like seeing you like this. If this is about belmont, we could have a transfer processed by next semester. You don't ever have to go back there again. I would love to have you closer... You and me against the world. Think about where you're meant to be. You know, I only want what's best for you. I know, dad. Thank you. I love you. I love you. We are unable to take your call at the moment... ...please leave your name and phone number after the beep. Hello? It's Ryan. It seems wrong letting Christmas go by without... In the book... "Jane eyre..." You opened it? I re-read it. Cover to cover, and... Couldn't help but think of you. Your song... You listened to it? Yeah, it was beautiful. So do think you'll get a white Christmas, mol? Uh, no. No. Snow in Seattle's really... Hang on. It's coming down. Tell me what it's like. It makes all the lights feel magical. Makes everything feel like... Like what? Like a blank slate. New and promising.
