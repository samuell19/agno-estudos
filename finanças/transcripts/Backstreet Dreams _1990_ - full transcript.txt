Dean: WE'VE HAD 4 SECOND OPINIONS. OK, SHANE, I WANT YOU TO TAKE THE TRIANGLE AND PUT THE TRIANGLE IN THE TRIANGLE HOLE. OK, SHANE? WATCH. OK, SHANE, LET'S TRY A DIFFERENT SHAPE. TAKE THE RECTANGLE, SHANE. SHANE? COME ON. COME ON, SHANE. SHANE? COME ON, SHANE. Man: SHANE AT 3 1/2 YEARS IS FUNCTIONING AT THE LEVEL OF AN 11 OR 12 MONTH OLD. AND FROM THE GENERAL HISTORY THAT YOU'VE GIVEN ME, THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY DOUBT. YOUR SON IS AUTISTIC. THAT'S FINE, STEPHANIE. I'LL TABULATE THE SCORES. BRING THE BOY INTO MY OFFICE. Dean: SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO FOR HIM? TO SPEAK FRANKLY, THERE ISN'T ANYTHING WE CAN DO FOR HIM NOW. YOU SEE, HIS BEHAVIOR PATTERNS ARE STILL FORMING.

[TAPPING ON TRAY] YOU ARE THE FATHER. YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT, DEAN. Stephanie, voice-over: WE BEGIN. SHANE CLEARLY SHOWS THE CLASSIC SYMPTOMS OF AUTISM-- AN INABILITY TO RELATE OR INTERACT WITH PEOPLE. LACK OF SPEECH, A STRONG RESISTANCE TO BEING HELD. AND TOMMY DOESN'T KNOW WHAT DAY IT IS. THAT'S YOU, SHANE. SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE YOU GAVE UP ON THE WHOLE BUNCH OF US, DIDN'T YOU? NOW IT'S OUR JOB TO OPEN UP ALL THOSE DOORS THAT YOU'VE LOCKED.

ANTANGELI CALLED ME TODAY. DID YOU KNOW HE'S LUCA'S BANK? FUCKING GUY OVERSEES EVERYTHING, INCLUDING ME. HE SAYS, "I WANT YOU TO RUN MY ACTION "ALONG WITH LUCA'S ACTION. AND THERE IS NOTHING IN IT FOR YOU." FUCKING GUY THINKS HE'S DON CORLEONE, MAN. HE SAYS HE WANTS TO TAKE A NEW APPROACH. THAT'S WHY HE SET LUCA UP. WAIT. HE ACTUALLY CAME OUT AND SAID THAT TO YOU? NO. BUT I KNOW IT WAS HIM. THIS ISN'T HOW I PLANNED IT, DEAN-- BEING HIS ERRAND BOY. SO IF I'M GONNA TAKE ALL THE HEAT... I'M GONNA MAKE IT WORTH MY WHILE. WHAT HE DON'T KNOW WON'T HURT HIM. ALL RIGHT? YEAH, RIGHT, MAN. ALL RIGHT, LOOK. ALL RIGHT, MAN. - IT'S BUTCH AND SUNDANCE ALL THE WAY. - ALL THE WAY? - ALL THE WAY TO THE END. - ALL RIGHT. [STEPHANIE HUMMING] COME ON, SHANE.
