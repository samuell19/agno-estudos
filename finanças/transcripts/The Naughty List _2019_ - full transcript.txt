How's it going Charlie? Snow is really coming down out there. It's been a hell-of-a day. What's it going to be today, Jr? A Shirley Temple or a Hot Chocolate? Ah, Hot Chocolate. Better make it a double. It's been a hell-of-a day. Oh! Shit... Are you okay, Evie? Gawd... no... it's fine... I'm... good. Lower your hand, Eves. Let me see your eye! I'm fine, Jace. I'm not going to say it again, Eves. Ahhh... It looks okay. You'll be alright. Told ya. Totally fine. Hey you heading back east for Christmas this year? No, I can't afford the plane ticket. I finally saved up enough to buy the car I've been eyeing as a Christmas present to myself. Cool. We've got a gig outside of Aurora the day after Christmas... You wanna come? It'll be a lot of fun just us... You got that order or what, Eve? Customers are waiting. Yeah, coming right up. Thanks for asking, but I can't It's an anonomous survey for my human sexuality class. It's called The Naughty List. I need to gather responses over Winter break, so please fill it out? What to naughty fantasies have to do with physical therapy? I have two theories. A, physical therapy is about the health of the whole person, sexual health included. Or B, my professor needs some fodder for his spank bank. Probably a combo of the two. Speaking of spank banks... I got some saucy shirts for the Christmas party! We're going to look like a couple of ho, ho, hoes. Perfect! Now get to work writing down your dirtiest fantasies. And be honest. I promise I won't read it and your name isn't even on it. Have you ever fantasized about bondage/kink? Hey Chickadee. Hey Kev! Someone just dropped something off in the parking lot for you. Oh my god! It's here! Jace, come see the Christmas present I bought myself! Jace? It's a convertible, Evie. Yeah I know. Do you have any idea how dangerous it is to drive a Mustang convertible around here? It's a death trap! It's not a death-trap. It's my dream car and I love it. Do you love breathing? Cause I give it a week before we drag you out of a ditch or scrape you off a tree. You have a Harley, Jace. A Harley I drive a total of two weeks a year, when it's not snowing. The rest of the time, my ass is in a safe, reliable truck! What the hell were you thinking? Easy brother. Give me the keys. I'll get your money back tomorrow. You're not driving this. I'm an adult. And I don't need you... Give me the keys, Evie! Harsh, dude. Way harsh. Merry Christmas everybody! That candy cane is looking pretty dangerous. Should I be worried? Maybe. I'll stab you in the heart and eat it after. The perfect crime. Bet you thought I was too stupid to think of that. I never said you were stupid, Eves. You implied it. Same thing. - I was a dick. - Yep - And I'm sorry. - Can I have my keys back? - I'm not that sorry. - Jace -I'll take you car shopping this weekend. For something that will keep you safe. You're important to me. If something ever happened to you... I'd, I'd lose my mind. Important to you like Kevin, Ryan and Heather are important to you? L Yeah... I guess. Kind of... Hey! The slopes closed ten minutes ago. It's a madhouse. Coming! - We all good, Eves? - Yeah, sure. Totally. I'm heading out. Yeah. I'll be there in a minute. Are you sure you don't have it? I'm sure-sure. Retrace your steps. When's the last time you had it? Here in the break room. God, this is so humiliating! It's not that bad. I mean, you didn't write your name on it did you? - No - Then you're fine! It probably fell to the floor and Kevin swept it up. And besides, even if someone read it they won't know you wrote it. That's true. Alright, you good? Good. Let's go! Gonna get a drink. Hey. Another vodka cranberry? Yeah, thanks. Everything going okay? I'm good. Just seem... kind of quiet. Just thinking about things. Oh, what kind of things? Naughty things. What? I said interesting things. Oh. Do you mind staying to help me clean up later? Kevin took off and... - Heather and Ryan seem... - Busy! Yeah. Sure. No prob. What's this? It's for you. A present. Is it true? Which part? Any of it. All of it. Is it true? Yes. All of it. And it's been true for a long time... Why didn't you say something sooner? I don't know. I'm kinda shy, I guess. Why didn't you say something sooner? Well... you were kind of young when you showed up here. I wanted you to have some fun before I settled you down. Then, when you seemed ready for what I wanted, I realized I was I was your boss. I didn't want to make you uncomfortable. You could never make me feel uncomfortable, Jace. I had to be sure. It was torture, but I knew, if it was gonna happen between us... you were gonna have to make the first move. I'm going to buy Heather something huge. And her pervy professor too for coming up with this Naughty List idea. - I came up with my own list. - O... -After reading yours. - O, your own Naughty List... - Um huhm Mine's more of a Nice List. All very, very nice things. Tell me. The first was get some balls and find a way to show Evie how I feel about her. Well mission accomplished there. The last thing was to run the bar with her, marry the shit out of her... have 3.5 kids and a Husky named Nanuk with her. Make a beautiful life with her. Nanuk, huh? Nanuk is the best name for a Husky. Everybody knows that. Well I really like Snowbell. Ah... then we'll have two. I love you, Jace. I love you, Evie. Merry Christmas, Jace. Merry Christmas, baby. [January 1st may still be a few days away, but this night, it's the start of our new beginning... our new life... together.
