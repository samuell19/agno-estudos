Ripped by gdhaliwal23 Sir, I've a question.. - Sir, answer a question of mine.. MLA sir, one question, please.. Just one question, please.. One at a time. Look, it's the court which will take the final call. As far as Shinda is concerned, he's been humiliated a lot. That's why, I thought I must come to the court. I'm drenched all over again. Shinda! - Hold on. Shinda! Shinda! Who is it? Hello, uncle. - What kind of a job is this? What's the matter? You're roaming around with his sister. We love each other and want to get married. How will you marry her? You are totally broke. Have you ever seen a bank manager's sister marrying a driver? He is a millionaire. You keep telling people that your uncle doesn't care for you after your parents expired. Did you ask me before doing all of this? You wouldn't get me married to his sister even if I had told you. How could I? How could I? You are useless. Your roof leaks all the time. Which girl would come and live here? I've paid Fauji, Rs. 1 lakh in advance, for the house. I'll pay the remaining amount and buy his house. You can talk to Fauji if you want to. Laalli and I will live there. If you were capable of buying a house then you wouldn't have fixed your mobile phone with a tape. All right, sir. Let's end the matter right here. Let him buy a house if he can. I will get my sister Laalli, married to you. But I'll give you one month's time for the said task. Don't you dare talk to my sister if you don't buy the house within a month! Don't break your promise, if you are the son of a Jatt. Manager, I will certainly buy the house now. Let's go, sir. Shinda, reform yourself. Let your father's honor in this village remain intact. Okay? Uncle, shut the door on your way out. And get my cow inside if you have the time. Did they leave? They left. Come in, now. I won't come in from here. If you have the courage, then let me in through the door. "You and I together, and a lovely night." "We meet in such a way that it remains unforgettable.." Don't challenge a Jatt to flaunt his courage. "You're my life." "I don't want to live without you." "You reside in my heart for a reason." "You're in the lines of my palms." "God has sent you for me." "You reside in my heart for a reason." "You're in the lines of my palms." "God has sent you for me." Stop. At least, take a breather. What is it? I've got new clothes stitched but you barely noticed. You know what, when you come in my dreams I don't feel like waking up. But when you meet me in reality, it's not a big deal. You know what, even when you're not with me it's not a big deal. But when you do meet me, you steal my soul away. "You and I together, and a lovely night." "We meet in such a way that it remains unforgettable." "I'm the heart and you're my heartbeat." "You're my life." "I don't want to live without you." "You reside in my heart for a reason." "You're in the lines of my palms." "God has sent you for me." "You reside in my heart for a reason." "You're in the lines of my palms." "God has sent you for me." Come at 6 o' clock. "When I don't see you, I get restless." "My heart asks for your love all the time." "You rule my heart. How do I tell you?" "Only God knows that." "I wait for you." "I'm devoted to you." "I don't want to live without you." "My eyes long to see you." "You've made me crazy with your love." "It's the color of love." "My eyes long to see you." "You've made me crazy with your love." "It's the color of love." "I've cried and prayed for you." "My tears paid off." "I've attained you." "I've cried and prayed for you." "My tears paid off." "I've attained you." According to you, that's our kitchen and our drawing room will be over there. No. That one is the drawing room. Then what's over here? We'll put a badminton net here. - Okay. This means, you'll come back from school and play badminton every afternoon. In the evening. - In the evening. Then what will we do in the afternoon? Sleep? - No. Work. Work? Okay. You'll work and I'll sleep. We'll keep plants over there. Don't say anything else. I'm going to put up a machine over there. Your plants will get crushed under it. We'll get clarified butter, milk and butter from it. But how will you buy this house within a month? My grandfather's plot is at Khanna GT Road. I've found a buyer for it. I will at least get 8 to 10 lakhs from it. I'll pay 6 lakhs to Fauji and the house is ours. Now, start finalizing the design for the wedding cards. What are you doing? I'm saving it and you're pulling it out. It will tear off someday. What style is this? There is one sleeve and the second one is missing. You look like a joker. - Really? I'm fine this way. This is my style. No one can copy it. By the way, this house is no Taj Mahal. Fauji will remember that a cute couple bought his house. "When I thought of you, I turned towards the village." "When I thought of you.." "I turned towards the village." "When I thought of you, I turned towards the village." Binder, did it work? Did the mechanic understand anything or not? The mechanic wouldn't understand this. He asked me to tell you to dump it at a junkyard. I changed the nozzle myself. It talks with the wind now. You are useful at times. Listen. The electricity was turned on at 12 in the night. You didn't turn the motor on. Don't you have any responsibility, or you like being a glutton instead? Take a break, at times. Have tea. Sit for a while. I slog all day over here. And all I get is scolding. Why are you slogging over here? You are a good mechanic. Why don't you find a good job? I'm really stuck, sir. When my father died of cancer I had borrowed Rs. 2 lakhs from him. I'm unable to pay off the debts. So I have to be his slave now. Being the son of a Jatt, I'm roaming around like a dog. It's been 10 years since your aunt died. She left the medication and pain behind and departed for the heaven. She was afraid that the lover might flee. Before dying, she made me promise something. We have a shop nearby. She said that I should open a dispensary over there. So that the poor can get cheap medication. Guddi's in-laws demanded a motor cycle on her wedding. I had to borrow money from that shop. This is the only demand that my wife made in her life. And she was very stubborn. If I die without opening a dispensary then she won't even let me enter the heaven. She'll stop me at the gates. No, you can't pass. - No.. Don't worry about that. We'll help you get in. That's strange. Binder, didn't you pay this time? No, sir. They say that the new inspector is a scoundrel. Is it? - Yes. When he catches someone, he won't listen to anyone.. Even if you get an MLA's recommendation. New inspector of the village. Sir, they were misbehaving outside the girls' college. So, we arrested them. - Oh. On your feet! So, what were you doing outside a girls' college? I had some work there, sir. And you? - I go there to eat. MLA Ratowal is my uncle. - I see.. Take off your glasses. What does your uncle MLA say? Tease girls! Put them behind bars! - Come on in! Who's in charge of this police station? Inspector Sucha Singh. All right, then, sir. Flex your muscles and the police will flex theirs. Both parties will investigate together. The thief will be caught in a year or in six months. But will I get the cooler back? Do you want to suffer from pneumonia by using a cooler during winters? You'll get the cooler by summer. Inspector! Hello, sir. - Hello. - Hello. Are you in charge of this police station? - Yes, sir. What are you doing? - I'm filing a report, sir. This gentleman has been robbed of his cooler. Give him. - Show me. - Read it. Sir and his wife were.. Were tired and sleeping? Are you filing a report or penning down a story? Sir, I'm an emotional person. It brings a nice feel to the report. - Quiet! What's your name? - Sucha Singh. Look at this. The way you write a report, your name should have been Idiot. Thank you, sir. - Come on, get the jeep. We need to go on patrolling. Come on. - Okay, sir. Come on. - Okay. Yes. You've remembered me today again, at this time. Happy.. Who's calling him? It looks like he's flying. No. I'm not drinking. Can't I sit with my friends casually? You must be tired. Should I say the rest? No. I'm talking to you. Come on. - All right. Okay. Not yet. We want to drink some more. No.. Bye to you. Okay! Was it the teacher? - No. A random friend. It must be her. Who else will call him? - No, no. Listen. They're talking about a girl. Tell them your story. Forget it. What's the use of talking about the past now? Was there someone in your life, sir? Madam's beauty was divine in nature. When I made that wall for them. No, tell them when you jumped the wall. - Not now. First, listen to this. My brother-in-law's master is very strict. - Okay. And the ma'am.. The ma'am is so delicate and fragile. He's revealing it. I was young at that time. What could she do? She offered me tea. - Then? So, Bant, did you have the tea or not? Let it be. I will forget everything. Not yet. He didn't go there to drink tea but to eat food. - Hey! He's had a lot of tea in life. What are you doing? You damaged my mules. You tried to entice a teacher and you're concerned about your mules now? Look, Jarnel, the boys are making fun of me. Sir, tell us another story. What will he say? He tried his best to entice the teacher. Really? - Then? The teacher and he would sit next to each other. - Then? Then, the teacher.. Then? What else? The bus broke down. Look at this. He's done. This is the problem with old men. They just have two drinks and start talking about yesteryears. Forget about him. Look.. All the influential buildings in this locality.. The primary school.. The village head's office and the government bank.. Yes.. Your honorable father Mr. Ramchandra Mistri had built them. We know that. His father built this bank. No. Listen to the whole story about the bank first. Let me tell you something about this bank. - Yes. During the war.. - The Sino-Indian War.. Yes. At that time this building was Mr. Lahoriram's.. Mansion.. - And this.. - Yes. Can you hold this? Of course, sir. If you continue with this behavior of yours you'll soon be beaten with this. Where was I? - On the chimney. Yes. Chimney. The chimney would open straight in to Mr. Lahoriram's living room. That living room is now this bank's treasure room. Absolutely.. Binder, hold this. Sir, I have another solution for this. - What is it? Tell me. Look at this. - What did you do? I've conducted its final rites. It'll rest in peace now. I used it only for six years. - Six years! Sir, get your mules made of steel this time. Steel? - Yes, at times, you can use them to boil milk. Was it really the mules? What are you doing? - I'm clicking a picture, sir. A picture.. - Do one thing. Turn around and come this side. He's actually turning around. - Ready? Smile. Show us the picture. This is just a mobile phone. It doesn't have a camera in it. Well, he fooled us. How will a photograph come out of a taped mobile phone? When my father had built the government school.. I was 18 years old.. Praise the Lord. Bittu. - Yes. - Hasn't ma'am come yet? Mr. Shinda, Laalli ma'am gives him tuitions. Just because ma'am gives him tuitions doesn't mean that he can sit on madam's seat. Get up or I'll throw you out. Useless fellow. - Okay. Good morning, Laalli ma'am. Good morning. Sit.. Good morning, ma'am. Good morning, Maninder. It looks nice. Is it a Gucci? Gucci is not my relative. It's my own. I bought it for someone special. We have reached. I want to get off first. - Me first. Be careful, children. Get off carefully. Don't push. Come on.. Hurry up. We'll meet during the recess. Hurry up. - Okay? Yes. Come on. Hurry up. Okay? Yes. Careful. - Come.. Manish. - Come. Come on. Are you a teacher? Do you give tuitions as well? Come.. She'll come to me complaining about you now. Call us for tuitions too. - Shut up! Why do you get angry? Come home and teach us. Didn't you hear what they were saying? I heard. I'm coming. Coming, ma'am.. Go. - I'm going. Hold the key. They might get hurt. What happened, Laalli? - So, driver. What do you want? I don't want anything, pal. I only have a request. - What request? Please leave. - Looks like you want to get thrashed. Look, pal.. - Hit us. You don't know what I can do. What can you do? In such a situation, it's better for me to run. That's splendid, driver. You found the perfect place to be thrashed. 15th December, 2007. Harjit Singh started this place. Wood is cut here. But he didn't know that Shinda would bring men and cut them here. I would have broken your bones right there. But it's not good to fight in a school. It has a bad impact on children. When a Jatt has such a beautiful lover he knows how to protect her. I'll treat you like royalty. "Boys are crazy about me." "They follow me everywhere." "Boys tease me wherever I go." "I'm precious.." "I'm precious. Treat me like royalty." "I'm precious. Treat me like royalty." "There's a solution to that, beloved." "I will rest only after I thrash someone, beloved." "There's a solution to that, beloved." "I will rest only after I thrash someone, beloved." "You steal my heart when you look at me." "You're precious.." "You're precious. I'll keep you in a silver box." "You're precious. I'll keep you in a silver box." "It's a new veil. The color will mesmerize you." "When you're intoxicated, my eyes will make your intoxication vanish." "I disappoint the boys by kicking them." "I'm precious.." "I'm precious. Treat me like royalty." "I'm precious. Treat me like royalty." "You're as white as milk, while your eyes have kohl on them." "Flowers yearn to fall on you." "Your dancing has made my knees hurt." "You're precious.." "You're precious. I'll treat you like royalty." "You're precious. I'll treat you like royalty." "You're precious. I'll treat you like royalty." He's here. Hello, aunt. Hello, aunt. - Hello. Hello, Shinda. Did you find some work or are you still idling? I drive a school bus. Uncle, someone told me that our plot has been sold. Yes, it has been sold. Please give me my share of the money. I need to pay for the house. What share? Your father has already taken your share of the money and splurged it. Tell him, Jagiro. Didn't you feel ashamed while saying it? What share? We have a share in your house. Listen. Don't talk to me about this again. You've come early in the morning to ask for your share. Go and do your work. Shinda. Hold on. You must think before you talk, child. You'll only get that share which you rightfully deserve. One minute. Here you go, child. Have a beer. Listen, child. Here you go. Eat something. And give some to your grandpa too. - Okay. Okay? If you're talking about rights then practice what you preach, uncle. Shinda.. Listen.. Come to the bank with me. I want to open an account. An illiterate like me can't manage all of this. Why are you quiet? You're idling anyway. I'm idle now, sir. My job is done. Come on, sit. - Okay. - Come on. Hello. - Hello. I want to open an account with your bank. Here you go. Form number 19. Deposit Rs. 500 along with the form at that counter. 500? - Yes. I've come to take a loan from your bank and you're asking me for the money. We charge a fee to open an account. You can deduct from that. From where? - Let me explain. Deduct Rs. 500 from the loan that you'll lend me. Oh, God! Such strange people visit our bank. Ma'am, is the file ready? Just two minutes. It's almost done. Why are you looking there? You've come here to help me. Pay Rs. 500, sir. You'll have to pay. Pay them. Here's Rs. 500. - Do any of your acquaintances have an account with this bank? I'll need his signatures. Yes, indeed. I have this boy. This boy? His account is frozen. He opened an account once and never came back. No, Ms. Pushpa. No. Don't close his account. Who knows, he might take a loan for a bungalow someday. Come on, sir. Let's fill up the form. Pass this file over. - Bye. It works properly now, doesn't it? Your turban is ready. Wear it now. You just keep stitching turbans. Our lives have become meaningless. Hey! I'll thrash you, you rascal! Give me my ball. Hey! Don't you have any shame? What nonsense are you talking! Don't you stop him from doing so? He's abusing people. How can I forbid him? He's bound to behave like the kids he plays with. Brother Joginder has also got his son admitted to Adarsh Public School. Go out and play. Joginder may have admitted his son but how do I admit mine? Leave the machine. I'll wash my hands. Serve food to me. - Okay. Bunty. Help me wash my hands. Pour some water. Father, will you take me to Wajirpur tomorrow? Why? Is your younger sister-in-law getting married there? No, father. There's a fair over there, tomorrow. Fritters and sweets are going to be served over there. Is it so? You mean, I should ride 20 kilometers to get you fritters. Have you never eaten fritters before? On Goldie's grandfather's funeral last year I arrived late from school. They had run out of fritters. All I could relish were the sweets. Bunty, why are you complaining? Goldie.. - When my grandma dies, you can have as many fritters and sweets as you want. Binder, feed some fritters to your son or he'll start praying for my quick death. Grandma. - Right? Look. The boy is handsome, isn't he? He's very handsome, aunt. I've chosen a boy who is One in a million for my girl. He runs a transport business in Canada. He's their aunt's sister-in-law's relative. Laalli, take a look. Aunt, I don't want to get married abroad. Why not? Girls are desperate to get married in Canada. I know what the real reason is. Should I tell aunt about it? Tell her. She has lost her mind! She doesn't want to go abroad. She wants to marry a broke driver. He has no family! He doesn't even have a house! She has lost her mind! She's not aware! Laalli! As long as I'm alive, you can't marry that driver! But you told Shinda that you would get me married to him if he buys a house. The money that he was confident he would get.. His uncle refused to give it to him. He can't even buy a chair now, let alone a house! Aunt inform the boy's family that we accept this alliance. Call them as soon as possible. I understand your pain, Laalli. But your life will be ruined if you run after Shinda. I can happily ruin my life for Shinda. "The heart cannot forget love." "Cannot see the ones who are helpless in love." "Love destroyed Majnu." "Love made Ranjha a crazy person." "The ones who are destroyed in love become crazy." "The one who has to go through it, only he understands." "The one who has to go through it, only he understands." That's wonderful, my Lord! I thought you never heard the prayers of the poor. But today I realized that you don't even hear the prayers of the rich. Else, you would have heard her prayers. But it's enough now, God. I've endured enough. Please forgive me. Whether you help me or not.. I won't let her go now. The bank's repayment stopped and Bant shut his shop. How will a man live if his only dream is shattered? Sir! Sir! Sir, no! Sir, what are you doing? Sir! Sir, what are you doing? Sir! Let go of me! - Sir.. - Let go of me! I don't want to live! Let go of me! Leave me. - Sir.. Listen to me.. I don't want to live! - Why, sir? Why are you doing this, sir? You don't get life so easily, sir. Do you get a bicycle easily? If you had to save me then you should have saved my bicycle too! Oh, God! Sir, life laughs at those who cry and makes those cry who laugh. Cry as much as you want today. I won't let you cry henceforth, sir. I won't let you cry. Look, sir, you can't get rid of your sorrows by dying.. Else, you'll have to suffer in your next life also. We'll have to bring an end to them while we're alive. Right, Binder? Sir, tell me something. Who doesn't have sorrows here? I, Binder, Mr. Jarnel. Everyone has problems. Tell me how much to pour, sir. - No. I won't drink. What's wrong with you, sir? Fill the glass. - Binder. Enough.. I can't even pour anymore in it. Sir, it's not a big deal. The three of us are distressed because of money but we can solve our problem. How? Robbery. He wants to commit a theft. He's gone crazy. We'll commit a robbery? Yes. A robbery. Hey, Binder! Forget it, pal. Suggest if you have another idea. We won't do this. Sir, how much money do you need? - 2. No, 2.5 lakhs. Binder, how much do you need? I need 1.6 lakhs. I don't have any bungalows. I need 5 lakhs. I just need to get the registration done for Fauji's bungalow. One locker. By robbing just one locker, all our problems can be solved. What nonsense are you saying? The area where we live in even if you rob all the houses in this village you won't be able to gather the money that we three need. This is where you're wrong, Binder. We won't rob homes, but a bank. The bank in our village? The bank in our village. That bank seems to be even poorer than us. I think it's running on loans. We won't get enough money for even one person by robbing this bank. What will you two do? This is where you're wrong again, Binder. I've calculated everything. When it's season, the bank holds at least 14 to 15 lakhs. Binder, I agree that the locker room is locked with a very big lock. But there's a very small lock on the safe inside which is the money. We can easily break it open. Sir, through the locker room.. The chimney that Ram Mistri had made. Yes, sir. Yes. I'll go down that chimney, get the money and come out from that chimney. Just imagine. Think about what is to be done. Or else you won't be able to open a dispensary. And you won't be able to get your son admitted to school. It's up to you. Shinda, here you go. Pour some. A drink in my father Ram's name. That's it. - Alright. I agree that this is wrong. But my intention is right. All right. Now smile. Smile. What's the matter, sir? Has it broken down? No, no. We're replacing the water and oil in it. - I see.. What do you take in this? We take money to Ludhiana Every day from this bank. Every day? - Yes, every day. Without fail? - Yes, without fail. Okay. What time do you have to leave? Not later than 4:15. We have a lot of time. It's just the two of you. What if someone tries to loot it on the way? What do we have this for? We fire it once and it shoots out 36 bullets. It'll destroy him. Put it down, sir. You might fire by mistake. I was just asking. No one can loot it, sir. Okay. You leave. - Okay. Come on. This means all of us can be killed in just one shot. Forget that. Listen to me. I've enquired about everything. All the money is deposited before 12 p.m. The bank's vehicle comes at 4 p.m. to collect the money. Whatever has to be done Should be done between 12 and 4. On a weekday. - On a weekday. Sir, this seems like a risky job to me. We'll see what happens. I have already hung my wife's picture on the wall. Stand up. Come on. Stand up. Move your foot. Hold this, sir. Oh gosh. Binder. What's this? Oh, my! It's so beautiful. Amazing. Bant, you're a carpenter, but he's done a better job than you. Should I hire him as a compounder? A doctor has a compounder. We need to commit a theft. Tell us what we have to do. Look, this is the bank, this is the bar this is the police station and this is Laalli.. I mean, the school. I had built this beside the police station. That madam lives here. And my house.. - Sir, if you continue to behave like that then I'll move your house to a far off place. Listen to me. What are you staring at? No, no. I was looking at Harjan's house. His wife is very beautiful. Tell me something clearly. Do we have to commit a robbery or elope with someone's daughter or sister? No, no. - No, no. We have to commit a robbery. - Yes. Come to the point. Listen. It's lunchtime at the bank sharp at 1:30. In the afternoon? - Lunch is the afternoon meal. At 1:30, the bank manager goes home for lunch. Binder, as soon as the manager leaves you'll have to get the chaos started between the confectionary and the bank, at this place. But be careful, make your calls with a new sim card. Is this Phaju Chaudhary? - Yes, speaking. I'm calling from the confectioner Chamanlal's house. - Yes, tell me. The confectioner Chamanlal's brother had a baby boy. Hearty congratulations. I don't even know when Chamanlal had a brother. He was alone. No, no. You are a bandmaster. Don't try to be a midwife. Why do you care as to when Chamanlal had a brother? Sharp at 1:30 tomorrow, you have to start playing music outside Chamanlal's shop. Okay.. Don't worry about the money. We'll get a lot of money tomorrow. What? - No, no. I mean we're going to get a lot of gifts tomorrow. We'll pay you well too. Don't worry. We'll be there at 1 p.m. No, no. Don't come at 1 p.m. We won't be there at 1 p.m. We'll be at the temple. Start playing at 1:30. Okay. Okay. We'll be there. We'll make the atmosphere lively. Listen.. Boliya. - Yes, sir. There's happiness at the confectioner's house. Only one thing is in our favor. The bank is outside the village while the police station is at the very end of the village. Only one way goes to the bank from the police station. If we close this route somehow then the police jeep won't be able to reach the bank. That's the main road. How can we close it? Sir, there's an old road roller in the village. Look, it's parked right there. - Yes. Before leaving India, the British left two things behind. One is their language and the other is this road roller. English worked, but this never worked. A hundred mechanics got fed up, but this didn't work. But Binder didn't try, did he? He's right. - I? If Binder had tried then this road roller would be standing here by now. Then what are you waiting for, Binder? Get the road roller here. Binder brought your road roller here. Here you go, sir. Now it's your turn. Exactly at 2:15 you have to go and pull the lever of the road roller. It will start from here and bump into the Santari post. This means the Santari post is blocked. The road is blocked. Get the jeep out if you can. It's done. I will pull the lever exactly at 2:15. Arrange for a snake charmer as well, to block the road. After that, sharp at 2:30 my scooter will be on stand over here. I will get the money. The one who manages to sit can flee. Or else you'll be left behind. No, no. We'll sit. What will we do over there? - We'll come. That's it. Then we'll cross the bridge and reach the forest. We'll be wealthy. There you go. The bank will go bankrupt. Okay. The day of the robbery. Noon, 1 o'clock. Boliya. - Yes, sir. There are celebrations at a Sardar's house. They're lucky. May God bless them! May they flourish! When we go to the Sardar's house we'll make good money! "One, damsel. Two, damsel." "Three, damsel. Four, damsel." "I'm in love with you, damsel." "One, damsel. Two, damsel." "Three, damsel." Looks like the manager has been promoted. That's great news. - That's true. Amrit. - Yes, madam. Please make two cups of tea. - Sure. Right away. Why are they playing drums outside? Madam, there is an orchestra outside. - Orchestra! Let's go and watch. - Let's go. Rajeev sir, you also come. - Come. Okay. We'll work later. "You don't realize how beautiful you are." "Beauty blushes in front of you." "You don't realize how beautiful you are." "Beauty blushes in front of you." "I want to garland you, damsel." "One, damsel. Two, damsel." "Three, damsel. Four, damsel." "I'm in love with you, damsel." "One, damsel. Two, damsel." "Three, damsel. Four, damsel." "I'm in love with you, damsel." Looks like the confectioner Chaman had a grandson. Thank God! God heard his prayers after so many years. - Yes. "You gave me your heart and I'll give my life for you." "Our love will be eternal." "You gave me your heart and I'll give my life for you." "Our love will be eternal." "Accept my love, damsel." "One, damsel. Two, damsel." "Three, damsel. Four, damsel." "I'm in love with you, damsel." "One, damsel. Two, damsel." "Three, damsel. Four, damsel." "I'm in love with you, damsel." What's wrong with him? Please start. I beg of you. "One, damsel. Two, damsel." "Three, damsel. Four, damsel." "I'm in love with you, damsel." Please start. Oh, God! Hey! Hey! Help! Sir. Bant! Bant! - Who is it? Come here. Sir. - Yes? Sir, the sack. - What? Listen to me. Get me the sack from the tractor. That idiot. Strange? Salman Khan? Sukhjeet! - What happened? Come quickly! It's Salman Khan. Salman Khan! What is he doing here? Theft! Hello. Police station. A theft has taken place at the bank! - Bank? Inspector! - Yes, sir. Hurry up! A theft has taken place at the bank! A theft in the bank! Sir, that's strange. Inspector, get the jeep! Come on, start the jeep. Hurry up! What is this? Sir, what's this coming our way? How will we go ahead? You idiot! Get the bicycles! Hey, move it fast. Come on, hurry up. Come on! Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on! Thief! Thief! Open up! Open up! Sir, let it be. It's not your age to wield a gun. Mr. Rajeev, open this quickly. The manager took the key along. Hey stop.. Sir, it's a snake. - Come on. It doesn't know that I'm an inspector. - Ask them. What are you doing here? Why are you sitting here? Sir, someone named Kuldeep called us up. He asked us to come and catch the snake. - So, we've come. Sir, I'm Kuldeep. But I never called them up. There was no snake here. They've been playing the flute since morning and removed two. I wonder how many more they'll remove. Bhajan, arrest them. Get the bicycles. Come on! Move! - Back off! Get up! He's lying here like a snake. Sir, they were playing the orchestra here. Sir, I got a call Saying that the confectioner Chamanlal's brother had a son. Sir, I have seven sisters. And I'm the eighth one. My father died after I was born. I don't have a brother. Your father died, but your mother didn't. - Shut up. Come on, leave, go home and do your work. Shinda, it's very heavy. Did you steal the register as well? Don't crack stupid jokes, Binder. Sir, touch the money. Yes, manager. How much money was stolen? Manager. How much money was stolen? Take this. Goddess! I hope it's at least 9 lakhs. I'll come bare feet and offer a gold blanket to you. Sir, think before you make such claims. Later, you'll keep complaining to Binder. If you offer a gold blanket with this money then will you commit another robbery for the dispensary? How much is it? Sir, let it be. Don't get involved in this. If it were bricks I would have figured out just by looking at them. Count. This is strange, manager. I'm asking you how much money was stolen. Sir.. Rs. 9 lakh. How much? - Rs. 9 lakh, sir. Take a breather, sir. There are so many bundles of 9 lakhs. Can't you see? You're crying for 9 lakhs, sir. My fingers are aching counting the money here. How much is it? How much is this? I forgot again. I can't calculate. Have you lost your mind? - How many 9 lakh bundles do we have? How many times should I.. - Stop it! Hold on. Sir, the bank has been robbed. All the money is stolen. I don't like such games. According to my calculation, this is at least Rs. 9 crore. Rs. 16 crore was stolen? It's gone. No.. No. - Hold on. Hold on, carpenter. - Sir. Neither 9 lakhs, nor 9 crores. The stolen amount was Rs. 16 crore. You already left us. Sir. - Get up. Sir.. Salman Khan? - Of course. It was Salman Khan. That's why I'm saying so. You unnecessarily drive a person crazy. Inspector. - Yes, sir. Record the manager's statement. - Okay, sir. I'll be right back. - Yes. Have a seat, manager. Let's record your statement. Note it down. - Okay. So, where were you during the robbery? I go home for lunch during lunchtime. There was chaos outside the bank that day. So, I waited there for five minutes and then went home. The manager likes entertainment. Manager, your wife must cook at home, right? Absolutely. - That's more like it. This means whether a theft or a robbery takes place no matter what the manager has to eat the food cooked by his wife. What's your wife's age? What has her age got to do with this robbery? It is relevant, manager. This can prove if your wife can only make simple flatbread or stuffed bread as well. - What do you mean? I mean, sir says that the report should be a detailed one. Listen. The snake is not in the box. 35 years. - That's more like it. This means, even at the age of 35 your wife makes food and tea so delicious that a person would die for it. Hey! What is it? Sir, the snake has escaped. - Oh, my! Oh gosh. Take care of yourselves. Why do you have a stick in hand? They say that wherever there's wealth a snake is sure to come there. We must have a weapon in hand. I don't know about the snake, but the police will surely come. We must hide the money first. I don't understand whether this is a police station or a bus stand. Look how cunning the thieves are, sir. Who knew that there was a chimney on the roof of the bank? Sir this bank was Mr. Lahoriram's mansion, ages ago. It was sold to the bank much later. What did you say his name was? - Mr. Lahoriram. Mr. Lahoriram. Here you go. This is the crime scene. The real investigation begins here. Now keep Mr. Lahoriram in it. He seemed to be fat. So, let's keep this in. Here you go. Let's make another circle so that he doesn't flee. Now go and find Lahoriram. Sir, do you have the Lord of Death in the police station? What do you mean? I mean, only he can bring people back from hell. It's been 30 to 40 years since he died. How do you know that he's in hell? He could be a saint too. He used to give money on interest. - Keep quiet! One minute. If the punishment for stealing 9 to 10 lakhs is 2 years imprisonment then what is the punishment for 9 crores? You idiots! You got me trapped. I'm going to spend the rest of my life in prison now. Sir, you were going to jump into the river anyway. Look, don't talk about the river. I've already told you.. What is it? One minute. Leave me. - Sir.. - It's nothing. You stole from the stolen money? Have some shame. Look at this. - Look at what you've done. Don't you feel ashamed? I thought of getting my moustache and hair dyed. My wife used to like it. Sir, just be careful that you don't get your face dyed while getting your moustache dyed. You'll get us caught too. But.. - Listen to me. As long as this robbery case doesn't get solved, just be as you are. Don't try to show off when you go back to the village. What? Why would we show off? - No, no. Just chill. There's no question. Rather, you be careful. I know you two. Let's go. - Don't try to show off. Come. Sir.. Sir had called. He was very angry. We have to go to him. Come on, sit. Come on. Come on. Pal, please talk in my favor. Why do you worry? We're with you. - Yes. Do we have to go to sir's mansion? No. To the golf club. He is the MLA of the village Ratowal. Please agree. We are already spending so much. Let us make some money too, Suri. Who buys a plot worth 4 crores and sells it for 3 crores, pal? Be thankful that you're getting 3 crores. Jassi was telling me not to give you anything. Try to understand the situation. Get the papers. Come on, sign. No, pal. This is a loss for me. Jassi. - Yes? He says he's at loss. Don't move, Suri. Look at my shot now. You're finished. Suri, you couldn't even take care of a ball. How would you take care of the plot? Come here. So, chief, who betrayed me? Patwari and I suspect the manager. - Yes. MLA, why are you suspecting me? You sold it. Chief got the deal fixed for 16 crores. Patwari made the fake papers, deposited the money in the government account and filled the papers. Okay, sir? You got those 16 crores deposited in my bank fearing a raid. Okay, sir? For the first time, my bank was robbed in broad daylight. What's my fault in it? I even lost the little money that I was supposed to get from you. I don't want to listen to your arguments. I just know that the traitor is one of you three. I.. - Stop it. I'm giving you four days' time. Give me my money back. I.. I.. - Why are you stammering? If I don't get my money back.. Then I'll extract the money out of you. Manager. - Yes? What's the amount that you've registered at the police station? 9 lakhs. 9 lakhs. Pawan. - Yes, sir? Who's the inspector at this police station? Sir, Harken Singh. The one whom you.. - Yes.. He's a scoundrel. He never does anything for me. Call him. Inspector Harken Singh? - Yes. MLA Ratowal will talk to you. So, Harken Singh, a lot of thefts are happening in your area. Yes. - Do you understand? - Sir. I want results as soon as possible. This is not a remote area. It's my area. All this won't be entertained here. I won't let any crime happen here either, MLA. This is my area too. You understood it well. I want quick results. Mister, so many people are standing here. What's the matter? They've come to complain since there was a theft at the bank. I see.. Did you nab the thief? Do you find thieves so soon? They did their job and fled. Come on, you also go ahead. Shinda was happy. Very happy. Because everything was happening exactly as he had planned. So, are you ready to move into the house? I'm going to get the money soon. I'll even pay Fauji in a day or two. The registration will be done. You just be ready. You'll be covered in gold on your wedding. Don't just boast. You don't know how desperate my aunt is to get me married. We'll get your aunt some gold jewelry too. Why are you scared? Just sit on my Harley Davidson. "You and I.." "You and I.." "You and I.." "You and I.." "You and I look lovely together." "You're my baby doll and I'm your teddy bear." "You're my baby doll and I'm your teddy bear." "You message me, I miss you all day." "Wherever I look, I see you." "Both of us are close to each other's hearts." "You're my baby doll and I'm your teddy bear." "You're my baby doll and I'm your teddy bear." "You're my baby doll and I'm your teddy bear." "You're my baby doll and I'm your teddy bear." "My baby doll talks through her eyes." "I send you long messages, and you just reply with lol." "Don't say this. Say something." "Come to me, darling." "Don't fear, come near. You know I'm your teddy bear." "Just tell me why you like troubling me." "Stop your drama and come to me, baby. Hug me and sleep." "I've decided to tell my parents about this story now." "By God's grace, we'll soon be a couple." "This James Bond won't ever let tears come to your eyes." "You're my baby doll and I'm your teddy bear." "You're my baby doll and I'm your teddy bear." "You're my baby doll and I'm your teddy bear." "You're my baby doll and I'm your teddy bear." "You're my baby doll and I'm your teddy bear." What are you seeing? That they're not real. No. Your bangles are made of brass but your love is made of gold. Just wait for a few days and I'll cover you in gold. Explain to your dear daughter. Simple nature and robbery is a strange combination. A person unnecessarily gets scared of the police. Bant, listen to me. A wall at the police station has collapsed. Will you mend it? A wall has collapsed. - Yes. I'll mend it. Come on. At the police station, Bant heard a few things that shocked him. Here you go. Let's suspect the manager now. But, sir, there's something else that we need to think about. What is it? - Only a mason can know that the chimney of the bank goes straight to the treasure room. And all the old buildings in this village were built by some mason named Ram. Really? What did you say his name was? - A mason named Ram. Hey, you! - Yes. - Come here. You're a mason too. Do you know Ram's family? Who's his family? I don't know anything. I'm not from here. Sir, they say that he has just a son in this village. He too is a mason. What is his name? All right. Here's the unknown mason. Sir, I don't think this was executed by just one person. Because getting this road roller here seems to be the work of some good mechanics. This seems to be the plan of a group. Hey, pal! Will you tell the police how the crime was committed? You think that the police are useless? That we don't know anything? Idiot. What was his name? - A good mechanic. Here you go, sir. Now let's keep this mechanic under suspicion too. Here he is. Bant used his brain and did what he could. He picked up the things and ruined the police's suspicion. Are you out of your mind? You brought Mr. Lahoriram under suspicion again? Will we bring him back from hell? Sir, Lahoriram is fine, but who is this new person under suspicion? Who is he? - I don't know. He doesn't look like he's from this village. Show me. Sir, he looks like a Chinese agent to me. Look at his nose. The Punjab Police were confused and troubled. The mystery wasn't unfolding. Sir, I wanted to give you some personal information. Yes. Tell me. During the police investigation, one thing has been revealed. What? - More than one person is involved in the theft. I see. The inspector was the MLA's henchman. Only a mechanic could repair it, no one else. Your case which is stuck.. - Yes. I'll get it cleared in two days. - Thank you, sir. Go. Binder. One thing is for sure. Whether a person dies holding a live wire or by jumping in front of a train he dies miserably. I need to pay Rs. 4 lakh to the village head. A villager can gulp down an entire bottle of alcohol but he can't keep a secret for too long. Pal, even.. What are you standing here for? Keep it and go. Idiot. Don't worry. Binder has a lot of money now. Your Binder is wealthy today. I've told these scoundrels umpteen times not to mix capsules in alcohol. You've gotten high because of that. Believe me. Binder can buy half the village today itself if he wants to. Just like that. I'll give you Rs. 4 lakh. Throw that amount at the village head's face. But I have a condition. - Tell me. The bag of money should hit his nose. Right here. Right at his nose. Get the bag tomorrow. - We'll break his nose. Hey, village head! Come out! Hey! Come out! Come out! I'm standing right at your door! Hey! What's the matter? You're creating chaos in a drunken state in the middle of the night! I pay for my own alcohol.. Take this drunkard away. People like you come and apologize in the morning. Don't threaten me! I'm drunk today! Listen to me! Here you go! This is the border. Cross this border if you have the guts! I'll break your bones! Take him away. For God's sakes, take him away. My pal Binder has got a lot of money. What did you say? What did you say? Who? Binder sir. Binder has so much money that he can buy seven villages. Binder sir. - Yes. You're very arrogant, aren't you? Tell me. How much money do you want? Go inside and decide. Bless you, pal. Today, you made Jarnel worthy enough to abuse the village head. Who's Binder? - He's brilliant. He works for him. Sometimes, he becomes a mechanic and sometimes a driver. Let it be. Stop it. Aren't you done? Jassi. - Yes. - Keep an eye on Binder. Yes, sir. I don't want to eat, Mandeep. I'm not hungry. Just tell me whether she agreed or not. She hasn't agreed even a bit. But never mind. She'll agree. You eat. I'm already in trouble because of this robbery. Moreover, she's made my life miserable. I have only one option left. That is to kill myself. The problem will be solved. What are you saying? Please eat. No, Mandeep. I'm not hungry. Just feed Laalli. Feed Laalli for sure. I can't live without Shinda, sister-in-law. Just make sure that you don't destroy my happiness while looking for yours, Laalli. She hasn't come yet. Laalli? She won't come now. "The heart cannot forget love." "Cannot see the ones who are helpless in love." "Love destroyed Majnu." "Love made Ranjha a crazy person." "The ones who are destroyed in love become crazy." "The one who has to go through it, only he understands." "The one who has to go through it, only he understands." Forget Laalli, Shinda. This boy has come from Vancouver. He's going to marry her and go back in seven days. If I show my true colors I'll send him back to Canada by the evening flight. As far as Laalli is concerned, I can kill many for her sake. And I can kill myself too. Even if you kill yourself, it won't affect anyone. There's no one to cry over your death besides a few friends of yours. Do you know why this boy from Canada wants to form an alliance with us? Because I have a reputation. I'm respected in the society. Even dogs won't bark at you. There's a huge difference of status between you and me. You won't be able to get there, Shinda. I can't get there but I can surely destroy your status, manager. Hitting me would have been of any use if Laalli was by your side. This marriage is happening with Laalli's consent. "Those who suffer from the ailment of love.." "Those who suffer from the ailment of love.." "Sit alone at nights." "Sit alone at night." "You can't fall in love with the moon." "You can't fall in love with the moon." "I want to tell this to the stars at night." "I want to tell this to the stars at night." "Love destroyed me." "I can only think about you." "Your memories are better than you." "Your memories are better than you." "They are with me at night." "They are with me at night." "If it was under my control, I would have come to you." "My eyes are looking for you. Where are you? I can't see you." "If your love calls me, I'll even leave God and come to you." "My fate is waiting for you." "My fate is waiting for you." "Those who suffer from the ailment of love.." "Those who suffer from the ailment of love.." "Sit alone at night." "Sit alone at night." On one hand, the day of Laalli's wedding was nearing. On the other hand the police investigation gradually got stronger. They slowly started finding evidence. The police had an eye on Binder. What's his name? - Binder. Is Binder at home? He's not here. He's gone to Patiala. - Patiala. He's on treatment, that's why. When he comes back, send him to the police station. Child, where do you study? On the terrace during winters and on the ground floor during summers. This looks like your father's doing, child. We are leaving. Come on. Besides the police, a few other people too had kept an eye on Bant and Binder. Laalli, I was just thinking about you. You would say that we'd have the drawing room here and the kitchen on that side. And we'd put up badminton net outside. It will be a wonderful house, but it'll never be a home. Now you'll have a home in Canada. We'll have our home here, Shinda. My sister-in-law and brother were pressurizing me. I was afraid of the people. And now? Then I thought that I can spend years being in fear but I can't live my life. I want to live now, Shinda. I want to live too. But not without you. Just be by my side. I'll take care of the rest. And yes, we won't put up any machine. We'll keep plants instead. What else? We won't have any cows either. We'll get milk for our children from the market. What else? We'll make a home. I didn't even take my salary. I sold my cow and bought a mare. How will we get milk now? It's okay. Everything will be all right. Excuse me? The police suspect us. I solved that problem for you. I threw those suspicious things into the river. What things are you talking about, sir? You won't understand. You are innocent. There they are. Pal. You've been working with me for so long and you still didn't understand something. When two people talk to one man, that man is the boss. Boss, shall we go? Let's go for a walk. Come. It's good. Now tell me, lad. What do you want to save? Money or life? I have the money already. Life is not in my hands. It's in God's hands. Whether it's mine or yours, MLA. You're quite hot-blooded. You're not scared of death. Listen to me. The mechanic won't be able to endure a bullet. That mason will die just hearing the noise. They don't have the money, MLA. Because I've hidden the money. If I die, then you won't get the money. And if you kill them then no matter what you do, I won't give you the money. Never mind. I'll still give you a day's time. Goodbye. Sir.. - Yes. It would have been great if we could shoot them right here. I've decided to kill them. Once we get the money, you can kill them. Mr. Pawan, we will get the money back, won't we? You will get the money for sure. No one could usurp your money till today, sir. Once we get the money back, we can settle this matter. What will we get by killing these poor and helpless men? What will we get? Mr. Pawan, it's been 35 years since you're working for me. That's why, you're still a PA. Go and make arrangements for the evening. Come on, Jassi. - Yes, sir. Shinda, let's return the money. At least, our lives will be spared. That's your delusion, sir. We'll be alive only as long as the MLA does not get his money. Now, there's only one way to save our lives. I am the person who committed the robbery in the government bank. Tomorrow morning at 9, I am going to confess to my crime at the police station. Some people will try to stop me, but I can't be stopped. Jatt James Bond. Did you see? That Jatt James Bond showed his true colors. Now, there'll be press over there. The whole village will gather there too. If he returns the money then will I steal the money from the government treasury? Jassi, take all your henchmen with you. Do what you can, but he shouldn't reach the police station alive. He won't, sir. Come on. Get the jeeps. Let's gather all the men. Your guns are loaded, but your brains are empty. You can't get hold of Jatt James Bond even if you want to. Come on! Get him! Hey, catch him. This way! You couldn't catch him, could you? Do one thing. Shoot him. We'll see what happens. But he shouldn't die. He should be mortally wounded. I'll kill him here. Okay, sir. Here you go, lover boy. Remember your lover now. You won't be able to think of God. A person shouldn't think of God only during trouble. And a lover who is told to remember his lover is not a true lover. Listen.. - Sir. Did you read this? Yes, I read it. Jatt James Bond. Go and do your work. Look at this. What do you think? Will he come? No one will come, sir. I think this is someone's prank. He'll come. He'll come. Looks like the police station has been surrounded, sir. These people have nothing to do. Let alone men, even women have gathered here. Do you want to break the roof of the police station? A Jatt has given his word. Jatt James Bond. Forget about him. You come first. I don't want to get beaten up. I'll thrash you so much that you won't even be able to open your mouth. James Bond's supporter. Get lost! - Come on! Come on! - Get lost! Get lost! You too. Should we send you a special invitation to leave? Get lost! He's trying to act smart. Sir, the press is waiting outside. A crowd has gathered too. Yes, James Bond. You haven't come yet. The whole village is waiting for you at the police station. I see. Okay, no problem. Okay. Okay. Bye. Sir, Jatt James Bond hasn't come yet? It was his call. He said he has a sore throat. So, he had some medicine. I told him, never mind. Do one thing. Go home. When James Bond arrives we'll make an announcement at the Gurudwara. You can come back later. What! - Hey! If you keep sending criminals away from the police station then you'll have to close down the police station one day. Hey! Arrest him! Shinda, you got into such a big trouble for our sake. Oh, my! I'll never forgive you. Shinda, you've embarrassed us. Is he your relative? He was our relative. This is Jatt James Bond, alias Sukhjinder Singh Shinda. This young man has confessed that he committed the theft at the government bank. He will be presented at the court tomorrow morning. So, you couldn't catch that boy. Jassi, you are of no use to me anymore. Go. Go to the cowshed and look after the cows. Pawan. - Yes. Ask the inspector at what time the officer leaves the police station. - Yes, sir. Inspector. Your phone has been ringing a lot these days. Sir, my wife.. You know how women are. Hello. You made spinach today also? You won't stop making spinach until its leaves start popping out of my navel. Make cauliflower for a change. I'm busy at the police station. You know that. Ask sir how much work we have here. Sorry, sir. The inspector was standing beside me, so.. Do understand. Yes, sir. Tell me. The MLA wants to know when the officer will leave the police station. Our inspector goes home for lunch at 01:05 p.m. every day. Okay. - Yes. Call me up. - Okay, I'll call you back. Okay. Okay. I'll come home and have lunch. My wife troubles me a lot. Gurpreet. Get me a cup of tea. - Yes, sir. Let the tea cool down. Sir has to leave now. Did you cool it down? - Sir, tea. Sir, tea. It's 01:10 p.m. Oh Lord.. - Bye, sir. Why are you greeting me? I just felt like greeting you. - All right. Stomach in and chest out. Like that. Sir, a bullet from a gun and the stomach never go back in. Yes, sir. Come quickly. The field is clear. Hello, sir. Come, sir. Come in. Come. Just one minute, sir. I'll open it. The door is jammed. Come.. There's your prey. Welcome, MLA. You will be shot here, and it will pass through from behind. Your body will disposed in the old river of the village. It will be found in another village. The police station and the inspector will be different there. The inspector there very well knows how this government runs. No report will be filed. There will be no inquiry. PA, what's the time? - 01.20 p.m. If this had to happen it would have happened by 9 this morning, MLA. By now, all the villages must have got the news that some Jatt James Bond robbed a bank in this village and confessed his crime. Now if something goes wrong then this news will reach the local press and followed by the Times of India. You must be thinking that this villager is talking like James Bond. I've been a law student. When my father died, I couldn't pay the fees. That's why, I started driving a bus. And under your government, no one gave me a job. But I can still argue a little like a lawyer. Forget all this. You tell me. How did the government come to me? Pawan, I told you that he's a wise boy. Listen. I've come to know that you're in love with the manager's sister. Give me my money back and I'll get you married to her. MLA, I knew that the government was going to fall but I never thought that it would fall to this extent. You've started being a middleman in marriages already. Pawan, I told you that the boy is too wise. Give it to me. Lad, I've brought a gift for you. He's still alive. But I've decided to shoot him. Now whether I should shoot him or not depends on your answer. I'll do what you say. Lad, can I take a picture of yours? Smile, please. Thank you. Jatt James Bond, tell your friend Binder to get the money to my farmhouse by 9 a.m. tomorrow. Take this. Get bangles made for your wife. Thank you. - Pawan. Where are you? Sir, the door is stuck. I'm locking it. Listen, get your door repaired. It gets jammed. As soon as you get the money tomorrow morning get the mason and the mechanic killed. What was the name of that shooter who we used in Abohar? Laadi from Kurukshetra. - Laadi. Tomorrow, Jatt James Bond is going to be presented in the court for the first time. Punish him before the judge does. Tell Laadi to aim at him. Until you call me and tell me that the mechanic has given you the money my emotional speech will continue. As soon as you call me, I'll drop a handkerchief. The shooter will shoot. No waste of time. Not on the chest. Not on the heart. Right here. On the forehead. Send him the picture. The story will end where it had begun. All of us did it, but you're being punished. This is what friendship is all about. I've brought your sweater. You say that this is your lucky sweater, right? I thought you might get lucky after wearing it. Binder, do you know why this sweater doesn't have an arm? My mother had stitched this sweater for me. She couldn't complete it. She died while stitching it. This has my mother's blessings. Whenever life tests me I wear it. I feel as if my mother is embracing me. There are some more clothes in this. Take care. Do one thing, Binder. We have no other option left. Go now. Make the arrangements. Take care of yourself. "The heart cannot forget love." "The heart cannot forget love." "Cannot see the ones who are helpless in love." "Love destroyed Majnu." "Love made Ranjha a crazy person." "The ones who are destroyed in love become crazy." "The one who has to go through it, only he understands." "The one who has to go through it, only he understands." "The one who has to go through it, only he understands." "The one who has to go through it, only he understands." "Love drives people crazy." "Love has destroyed many homes." "Love is intoxicating." "Love hurts hearts." "People die in love."

"The one who has to go through it, only he understands." "The one who has to go through it, only he understands." I'll have to go to court. He's a young man. And boys tend to make such small mistakes at a young age. But I'll still try to get the minimum of punishment for this boy. Sir, one more question. - No more questions. What is this? - No more questions. Thank you. Move aside. Yes, Pawan. Did you get the money? I've got the money. Okay. Pawan. Where are you? - The door is jammed, sir. Let's watch how Shinda turned the tables. This inspector goes home for dinner at night. - So? Do you want to remain a PA for the rest of your life? Don't you want to progress? Thank you. - Pawan. Where are you? The door is jammed, sir. I'll close it. Okay. 9 at night. So, Mr. Pawan. What have you thought of? Do you want to progress or remain a PA? What do you mean? The meaning is clear. Everyone knows about your loyalty. But why are you loyal to a disloyal person like him? This is politics, lad. What you're saying sounds very nice. But it's difficult to implement it. And I don't even have the chance or money for this. This is your chance. By God's grace, we have the money too. Someone has to be shot. What if that bullet becomes your life instead of being my death? It's very risky. I've worked for him and his father for 35 years. That's it. This is your only chance to rise above. Stick to your word and just watch what I do. Send him the picture. The story will end where it began from. I've got the money. There are many who try to be James Bond. But there can be just one Jatt James Bond. And yes, don't think that I killed you for the money. You've made many mistakes, MLA. But your mistake of kidnapping Mr.Bant was a grave one. Goodbye. Smile, please. The job is done. It'll cost double the amount. The man is standing at your door. MLA, goodbye. Jatt James Bond still has to reveal his trump card. Begin the proceedings of the court. This is criminal Sukhjinder Singh, alias Shinda. And here is the 50 lakhs that we've found on him. Your Honor.. - Hold on. Hold on. It's written here that the stolen amount was 9 lakhs. Where did you get the remaining 41 lakhs from, Sukhjinder Singh? Your Honor, I'm a very poor man. It's not my money. I've brought whatever I had stolen. The most respected and reputed men from our village are sitting right here. Ask them if you want to. They might have more information than me, sir. Your Honor, the village head forced me. I'm innocent, Your Honor. MLA Ratowal and the manager told me to do so. I'm innocent, Your Honor. I was asked to deposit the money at the bank. I did it. I didn't know whether the money was legitimate or illegitimate. The stolen amount was 16 crores. The three of them could reveal the same to the judge. But if they revealed that, they would get stuck. Hence, they thought it would be better to remain silent. There's a huge difference between the stolen amount of money and the money that the police has found. That's why, the court orders an inquiry upon the village head Patwari and the bank manager. Hold on. Take a breather. Move aside. When you come back, you'll find Laalli along with Shinda. Keeping in mind his surrender Shinda was imprisoned for six months. Patwari, the village head and the bank manager were imprisoned for five years. Hit it. - What are you doing? Don't you understand? - What did I do? You should have given it to me. Shinda, the jailer wants to see you. You've served your sentence. I'll come, sir. It's an important match. It's at game point. Fine, nephew. It's you who rules this place now. You had your way outside. But I won't let you have your way over here, James Bond. Serve. - Is it? Then, here's a gift from your brother-in-law to you, manager. You won't be able to attend the wedding, manager. Do one thing. Do attend the first Lohri of your second nephew. Okay? Goodbye. You oafs! This garland of Rs. 1000 notes. Such a big car. Don't you want to open your dispensary, sir? Binder, tell him. You're talking of a dispensary? Sir is going to open a medical college in the village. You'll be broke. It's crores of rupees. It won't get over even if we burn it. Binder, she was not our partner in theft. Binder.. - She's roaming about in a Mercedes too. Tell him. We gave her a gift from your share of the money. I'll be back, sir. Did you even miss me or were you just enjoying driving the Mercedes? If it was in my control, then I would have come to meet you. If it was in my control, then I wouldn't have been in jail. I would have enjoyed myself too. They're at it. Couples romance. What can loners do, mason? Let's get out of here. We're standing right outside the jail. Stop.. What is it? Did you bump into someone, pal? - Yes, we did. Leave on time. It gets foggy these days. What van is this? - It contains cash. Which bank? - SBI. It's just the two of you? - Yes, it's just the two of us. Leave. Leave on time, pal. - Okay. The thieves have left from the prison. "The world says.. The world says.."
