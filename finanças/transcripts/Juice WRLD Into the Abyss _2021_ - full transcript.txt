I've never seen anybody like Juice WRLD in my entire life. Somebody who can be so emotionally vulnerable, someone with talent that is off the charts and someone who is unapologetically himself. There's nobody like Juice WRLD. That was a special one, man. So much emotion. So much emotion, and... Yeah. Some of the stuff he says in it is so raw and so real. That's real art. That's not art to sell. That's just, you know, pure expression. With freestyling, it's literally, like, all off the top of the dome. You making up words that rhyme in real time. And when you could make up words that rhyme in real time with stories that align, it's like, you're one of a kind. You feel me? And so, he is like... It's like all that in one, and it's like it's just going and it's like, "Wow!" The top motherfucker can't do this. The top ghostwriter, who's writing for the top people, can't do this. It's like, "You..." "You...You...You trouble." He goes in and does the entire song, from start to finish, the whole song. The entire thing. Three minutes, four minutes, however long the beat is, he's going. So, he does the whole song, and he goes, "All right, run it back again." Does a whole different song. Complete different song. Then he goes, "All right, run it back one more time." Whole different song again. And then he goes, "Pick the best one." And then we do it nine more times. Each time I'm in with him. And it was... In that moment, my jaw dropped. And I said, "Oh, I'm in the room with a superstar." Like, I'm in a room with a guy who's gonna go down in history as one of the greatest artists of all time. I remember the first time seeing his name up there with "Drake, Juice, Taylor Swift, Post Malone, Travis Scott." These are people who have machines behind them, right? That's their whole... The whole, you know, drive behind some of these huge artists, like, you know? Whoever's up there is... that's part of their stature, is keeping them in top 5 in the world. You know, Juice wasn't trying to be that. Juice just became that. It's crazy to even say. He just became that. He just became the biggest thing in the world without trying, just making good music. Let's go, nigga. Hell, yeah, bro! All right, we going. Where can I go? Make some fucking noise! Do not lie to my home! Y'all fuckin' lyin' to my home! One, two, three, four! My girl's about to leave me 'cause I lost my Juul and I don't know what to do with my life. - Literally, find your Juul. - I'll send a text. If I don't find it, she gonna leave me and I'm gonna die. - That's sad, boy. - Is it this one? Whatever. Can't find his fucking Juul. She broke up with me over it. But I still see Her shadows in my room - People ask you to sing that shit? - Hell, yeah. It'd be the weirdest, hood- ass motherfuckers that'll be say...saying, "Sing that shit!" - Like, that's not you! - I'm not gonna sing that shit to you. My son knows it word for word. - How old he? - Six. Oh, man, that's what makes me smile the most. My wife said something... She said something to my daughter about being pretty, and then my son goes, "It's 'cause she's evil." Or no...My wife said something about being evil, and then my son goes, "It's 'cause she's pretty." And my wife goes, "What?" He's like, "That's what Juice WRLD said, 'Prettiest girls got the evil face.'" - It was really funny, dude. - Saving them young. But he's, like, super into music. sLike, he knows all the words... You're stupid. Get the fuck out of here. Nah, that's facts, though. Facts. Facts. Facts, facts, facts. - My bad, brother. - Nah, you good, nigga. Facts, facts, facts. What's up, you bringing this bitch? You want me to unplug it? - Yeah. You wanna drink some of this? - Yeah. Tonight's gonna Be a good night Forty on me like I'm Suge Knight Poppin' Xannies In the moonlight Baby girl Let the moon drive I just made my girl Some dark Sprite - Literally. - She said "It's good, right?" - Literally. - But it ain't good, right?

You should bring some champagne onstage and pop it. - Yeah, I want it. - I'm about to pop a bottle, y'all. Shake it more, shake it a lot. Wait, watch out. You guys, it's really hard. You gotta use both hands. - This is gonna pop out itself? No? - Yeah. Shake...It's not finna... It's not working. What the fuck? You gotta push it. It's gonna be harder to pop it. You probably just fucked it up. - Work! - Just fuck it up. Just pull it off. No, I was gonna... How this shit work, man? I don't know how to celebrate. Twist it a little bit first. There you go. Now push it. Yeah, it's coming now. - That's the white one. Watch it. - Now, you gotta sip it. That was like, awfully tense, bro. Hey, y'all. On the count of three, sing your favorite Juice WRLD song. One, two, three! So, I have a... You all like one of the ones I have? I'm a decent artist, right? I'm OK, at least? Y'all think Lucid Dreams deserved to go platinum like it did? All right. This Chicago, nigga! People! Make some fucking noise for Juice WRLD! - Shawn, unlock this tour bus. - Yes. That guy was attacking! - Lemme see that New York shit. - It's a safety pin. And in studio right now, we got a breakout rap artist, Juice WRLD in the building. Straight out of Chicago. Welcome, hermano. Yo, what's good? So you were telling us, bro, you have not gone to sleep. - Since when, bro? - Yeah. Last four days, probably. All right, on the internet right now, it... Every radio station has an interview with you trending right now. I don't even know how that's possible. From the U.K. to New York to L.A. now. - Congratulations on the grind, bro. - Thanks, bro. I appreciate it. From the studio last night, straight into this studio. You recorded some music last night. What, six songs last night? - My God. We stay working. - Stay working. There's a line you recently said too, that impacted a lot of people. "We're not gonna make it till 21." "We're not gonna make it to 21." - You don't feel that way, do you? - I feel like everybody dying young... Not foreshadowing or anything, or wishing that upon myself... - Man, I know, I know. - ...but, like... But you have spoken about death and your own demise. Yeah. Like, everybody... dying young. How old are you, if you don't mind my asking? - Nineteen. - Nineteen years of age? Damn! World is yours. Just getting started too. - You feel like it's just beginning? - Yeah, for sure. Juice, I'm gonna go ahead and put it on. You ready? Take your time. Sippin' water right now, ladies and gentlemen. From the dome? All right, from the dome. Off the top. - Y'all edit out, like, curse words? - No, do your thing. Go for your world. Juice WRLD in the neighborhood, hello! - Goddamn. - That shit... - Oh, shit. - He can do it all. - I know that wasn't from the dome. - It was. Lil motherfucker's on freestyle- freestyle. And I dome too. I don't think I've ever seen a motherfucker that can... that tight. It's my first sit- down with Juice WRLD. All right? That motherfucker got it. It was a pleasure hanging with him, man. He recognized what's going down. I love what this motherfucker is doing. Extremely humble. That's character. Juice out for image. Big boy. - What's happening? - Shit. Hey, look. I went to hit up James today. And he took credit for me putting the lean in the fridge, bro. It hurts. I thought I was doing the world a service. Appreciate y'all, bro. I though you was gonna be out today. It was all like... I told bro, like, don't fucking touch the soda, man. - Hey, Ally. - Hi. How's it hanging? Me and her met in law school. - Law school? - Law school. Yeah. Me, Ally, and Pete were actually all classmates. - I've known Pete for a long while. - And I I walked up to her... - I opened my... - Yoch will vouch for all of this. - I've known him for ten years. - I opened... my one of one... Calvin Klein briefcase... - Beautiful. I remember it. - ...and pulled out... ...some of the paperwork I was studying. It was actually the Jeffrey Dahmer case. Very interesting case. And... I see her and I say, "Wow." "That is a very studious..." - Don't... - "...beautiful lady over there." And, um... I leaned over to Pete saying... "Pete, oh, buddy, oh, pal." "I wanna go say something. Should I do it?" And Pete was like... "If you spread your wings, you'll fly." So, I walked over to her, and I was like, "Hey." He did. "After class, you wanna go share a strawberry shake?" And she was like... "No, I like chocolate." I tried again. And again and again and again. And finally, she said yes. And then one day, I smoked some PCP... ...and decided I was gonna become a rapper instead of a lawyer. - And now, here we are. - He just took me with him. Can you keep that take, and then start it from the top? Yep. You got it. I'll fuck with that. See what I'm on, man. Look, man. - Out here. - You on a...Did I see a dirt bike? - You did. - You know how to ride this thing? Hell, yeah. We're out here, man. You gotta... Turn that shit off, bro? What the fuck is you doing? Guess who that is. Max Lord. Gotta let him know what you're doing. - They been sitting on... - What the fuck is you doing? Man, Jesus... I'm trying to have a conversation with my... That's why I'm out here. Man... That's your boy, that's your boy. That's your boy, Max Lord, bro, look at him. What's wrong with him Flat? Where the fuck you at? Man, you look like youn at a goddamn village, nigga. I'm back, I'm in L.A. I'm at this little crib, I'm at...This is my fuckin'... - It's away... - That's the vibe. Like a village. On God. This shit got an elevator in his motherfucker, all type of shit. You out there on a dirt bike, now I hear y'all don't even know how to ride. Shit, I just learned really within the last two, three weeks. - The last what, nigga? - Like two or three weeks. I got decent at this shit. But look, though. When I was a shorty, my homie and them stole a four-wheeler. That's how it all got started. Gonna hurt yourself on that shit, man. Hell, no. I can't fuck up the money. I don't know if this'll go on the blog or not, but this is all you need in life. Nah, don't go, don't throw that... I mean, everything's worth a try except for, like, crack and shit. Yeah, exactly. Wait, you're not supposed to try it? Crack? Oh, no. Hell, no. No, sir. Only if, like, you really want to. Hell, no. Hell, no. I need some earplugs, bro. My shit just rang. - Yeah. It rang. - Fuck. This shit hurt. - I was gonna plug your ears for you. - Plug 'em real quick. My shit ringing, bro. All my life I've had, like, ADD, so my mom has been putting me on Vyvanse and Adderall, I've been to all the doctors' appointments. So, it's the same shit. And I don't really agree with that shit, bro. I was in fifth grade, getting diagnosed with ADD. How the fuck can you tell a fifth grader they have ADD? - He's in fucking fifth grade. - Kids have energy. How's you supposed to act? I would think it was something wrong with a kid, if he was in fifth grade and he was just wired in class like this. - I would think that he needs some... - I don't know, like, Xans or some shit. I don't know. Like... - Something to fucking bring him down? - Yeah. Like, that shit... And that shit didn't have me feeling right, bro. I should write a book about that, and then expose, like, the whole shit. 'Cause that's, like, not right. And I wasn't even the only kid that was on that shit in my school. But, like, it just felt like, you know, you took the pill... and for like 15 minutes, you're like, all your personality is enhanced. Like, you're all social, class clown, laughing. After the 15 minutes is over... - How y'all doin'? - Goin' nowhere, bruh. That was just raw. That was just raw. Tyler, the creator Y'all are a part of who I am today. That really means a lot. That shit carried me through my childhood, bro. Public Enemy or really all time type shit. That's crazy, that we did contribute, I really appreciate that. That's what real music does, though. That's crazy. I see, I love every single last one of you all with all my fuckin' heart. Thank y'all for coming to see me. You're the best supporters in the fucking world, and I mean that. Y'all put that shit in my life. Also, I wanna say... if you have dreams and aspirations, which I know every one of y'all do, then follow them, homes. Don't give a fuck what nobody say. Just live your dream. This is your world. You can do whatever the fuck you wanna do with it. And if anybody got anything to say about it, tell 'em to suck your dick! Oh, my next project from the front row. Juice WRLD. Make some fucking noise for Juice WRLD! I think I'm gonna be spending most of my time in L.A., though, until I get, like, tour and shit, 'cause I'm trying to like, just be out here in a stationary place, then entertain myself with some of these drugs and just... - Yeah. - I wanna ride dirt bikes and chill. - That's what I'm saying. - You have to do that. Yeah, couple of dudes get some of this anxiety off my chest. - How's it dealing with all this? - It's like... This is brand new, you know what I'm saying? It can come up on you fast. It's like... I mean, it's like, bro, it's like... everything feels surreal. - Yeah. - So, it's easy... to just keep moving. Sometimes, I just wanna take a second out of my day and think about it. Like, obviously, I know I'm blessed. I'm beyond thankful. Like, I thank God every day for this shit. Like, I'm blessed, bro. But... it still feels surreal. It still feels like at any moment in time, I could wake up and be in my bed and be like, "What the fuck?" - I knew this was a giant type shit. - Yeah, exactly. I feel like, when I stop and think about it, if I stop and think about it, that's how my head is gonna get too full, that's how I'm gonna become an asshole or somebody that went Hollywood, somebody that... No, not a genuine person. - Yeah. - So, I just keep it moving, I just make sure to count my blessings. And sometimes, this shit gets overwhelming, but this is what I asked for, you know, bro? - Yeah. - I wouldn't wanna do anything else. - Yeah, I'm feeling that. - I wouldn't. This is my passion. I love music, I love spreading a message, I love speaking my mind... ...and me being able to do all those things on one platform is, honestly, it's a blessing, bro. So, like... I wouldn't change it for the world, even though sometimes, you know, shit just kind of... shit keep getting hectic. Yeah. It get hectic. You got a special soul. Congratulations on all you going through, all you making... Thank you, bro, thank you, thank you. It's all authentic and well deserved. It's really a real thing for a real reason man, like... You one of them special children that's supposed to do what they supposed to. Thank you, bro. I appreciate that for real. Salutes to you. Man, that means a lot coming from somebody like, that I admire, bro. - You got that shit, bro. - Right. I can't wait to meet you in person, bro and make some music with you. For sure, shit's gonna be lit, bro. Is that bitch on? I wanna say something. - Sorry. Hmm. - You're fine. I don't give a fuck about having a phone no more. 'Cause it's like... Oh, no. Everything on a phone? Besides, I mean, my peoples, obviously, I need to communicate with my family and shit. But everything else is like... What's on my phone. Temptation. Fucking... plugs for drugs and shit. I'm trying to cut all that shit out, man. Fuck that. There's definitely no point to having a phone no more. In my position. - You see where I'm coming from? - Listen to music? Yeah. I will get an iPod. iPod touch, third generation. Jailbreak that bitch just like the old times. Damn, I'mma do that. Fuck! I'mma do that. Toast to my bros. Here you go. For another cup. - River, come here. - Oh, shit. What the fuck? - How you doing? - What the fuck? It's a pleasure. That's my girl, Ally. She's a fan of you as well. - Hi, Ally. How you doing? - I'm doing well, how are you? - I'm good. - This is my dog, River. And my other dog, Caplyn. Caplyn! Come here! Hey, I really want you to hear my album, bro. - I wanna hear some music. - We're gonna go to the studio. I gotta finish one more verse on a song, then we can lock in all night. - Come here, girl. - Let's do it. Oh, that's a lot of speakers. Press start. It's crazy. Um... I'm team Juice WRLD. - Love, brother. - Like, it's crazy. I love being in Juice WRLD. I'm so... I'm so... I don't know, man. I'm at a loss for words. - Thank you. - You that thing, you... I don't know, where'd you came from? Not from Earth. You'd like... It should go into Guinness World Records. - Thank you, that's crazy. - They got a museum across the street. - We can still put you up there. - Let's just go stick you in there. Keep your feet planted. All right? Look into the... Remember how we did the close up over there? And you were like, more relaxed? Same way we're gonna do that. - Very calm. You know what I'm sayin'? - You want me to roll this? Nice, yeah, yeah, yeah. Roll that. Roll on that. - Roll on that. - BTS, baby! Playback, playback! Playback music. Hit the playback. - Keep playing it. - Yo, that's it. - That shit was such a vibe. - Hey, Cole, can I dance? Yeah, you can dance. Just keep your feet planted. We're making a movie, music video, rather, for a song called "Robbery." This is actually the first song that Juice ever played me. So I'm super excited about it, 'cause this was over a year ago. This song's like... Hey, Juice. How old is this song? - Two years? A year and a half? - Probably about a year. So, it's been a long time. And I don't know, just cool. I'm excited. We did a lot of cool stuff. It's definitely my favorite video I've done with Juice. And I'm excited. I'm proud of him. Shouts out to Juiceness. One of the best people I know. - How's it going? - Good. No complaints. How about you? I'm doing really well. I'm excited for you. We're on the set of your Billboard cover shoot right now. You're releasing your sophomore album. At Death Race for Love. You were telling me a little bit about how you've struggled with anxiety. Do you feel like you touch on that a little bit in this album? Yeah. I do touch on it. I do. That's something that I feel like a lot of people neglect, which is completely, utterly wrong. And me speaking from... an African American man, I know that this stuff is neglected in, like, our community. You know, you tell your mommy, your daddy, your aunty, whoever, that you feel like you got anxiety, you feel like you got depression, you feel like you got ADD, whatever. They're gonna look at you like you're crazy. "Boy, you don't got that. Get out! Go ! Get outta here!" Like... Are you gonna tell me I don't got something, you know? That's not how it should be, but that's how it is, and that needs to change. And hopefully, I'm one of those people that could bring... ...that change, or at least start a chain reaction for somebody else to come and do it after me. Best merch in the game. Six hundred k in what? Eight hours, Pete? - Eight fucking hours, man. - You doin niggas records, yeah. Oh, you pretty pretty. Bro, this Perc's hittin' me. - You want one? - Want what? Ketchup, no mustard. - Those Xanax? - Hell, nah. - I stopped doing Xanax. - What is that? - Getting the last hit. - It's Percocet. I remember those days. - I remember middle school. - I used to do... Good times. I was popping pills at a real early age. - Did you just pop another one? - A half. - You mind if I get a hit? - Come over here. We gotta pop... We pop each... That's nasty as fuck. You take 30s? - You take 30s before? - Yeah. - Oh, cool. - Damn, I'm down to party. Y'all not on shit. I didn't know until my sophomore year, really, my junior year damn near, that any nigga could go to a recording studio. I thought that shit was, like, strictly for famous people only, you know? And then it clicked in my head that there's a bunch of people, not famous, rapping. But I thought, a motherfucker had to notice you and then put you in that position to record at a studio. But when I started finding out you can go by yourself, I was over it. I used to record music on my phone. Like, in the basement. And I used to... I used to free... I was just able to freestyle very well, but I used to write because I didn't wanna... For one, I wanted a chorus... But we didn't wanna finna go to the studio. I'm talking about the studios. Like, I didn't wanna go. I don't know, I be recording, like, ten songs a night sometimes. I be freestyling everything now. Back to what I was saying... Even when I first started going to the recording studio, I would freestyle a little bit. But then when I started taking this shit more seriously, I would write. Because I didn't have enough money to just be in the studio all day. And I ain't had no job. I used to have to rob and do all type of shit to get my cash. So like... I didn't wanna waste no time in the studio, so I came with my shit already prepared. At least I knew I was gonna get three songs done regardless, you know? 'Cause I used to only be in there for two hours. So, like, I would make sure I have 3 songs ready and pre-set for the shit. What about your new song "Robbery?" Freestyle. Hey, where does he go again? Hey Boston, make some noise! You know what I should do? We should get a private jet. A cheap one, a G5, just like two-mill one. What you just said is the lowest... G5 is like 30 million. No. We found a 2003 G5, for like... It's not a Gulfstream, bro. The Gulfstream is 20 million. It was a private 12-seater. Decent as hell. - That was probably like a Learjet. - It was decent. I want it. And it came with maintenance and a crew and all of that. You can get membership programs on that shit, though, where it costs... It's gonna cost, like, 20, 30, 45. After this album settles, saying they sold 164 the first week after tour, I'm not finna be flying coach no more. None of us is. I'm not even finna be flying first class no more. Think about it, though. We probably gonna throw it in the crowd at some point, you know? Do you wanna throw it or let me throw it? Hey, turn the power lights on, I wanna see what the fuck I'm doing. Before I throw it, everybody, one more time, scream, "Happy birthday, Ally!" Happy birthday, Ally! You stay your ass right there. Hey, so... MTV don't do Cribs no more, so, shit, it's Juice WRLD Cribs, the fuck you talking about? I don't think I have this... Like, this is my crib, bro. I came from nothing, man. - Jarad. - Yo, I'm right here! - The dogs are here. - Yeah, it's closed. The gate's closed. Yo, I come from nothing, though. Hey, what's this? A workout room or some shit over there? Damn. That feel good. Damn. I'm finna get skinny on y'all ass. Keep playing. No! We're eating. I'm finna get skinny, y'all motherfuckers. I got the... Gut, gut, gutty! - Damn. - What? I'm just... This shit is just crazy. That's all. That's all. Just a little starstruck at myself. - Huh? - I love you. Come on inside. Look at me. Gabe said he finna pull up. - Three, two... - Yeah, like this. Keep it full. You will die. Wait, I'll just randomly... tell them when to start. Samurai style versus Chicago style. Florida versus Chicago. I got a head... - He killed you! - Not again! - Body shot? - Yeah, it was a body shot. We having a tournament right now! - Yo, Herb! Who's that, Herb? - Yeah. Yo, Herb. I'm gonna kick your ass, bro. Hey, Herb. Pull up, bro. Pull up. I want all the smoke, bro. I want all the smoke, bro. Pull up. Man! Oh, hell, let's knock it off! Shorty, what the fuck you got all these bikes for, man? - Stupid, rich-ass bitch. - Look at this. Look at this. - The fuck is wrong with you? - This is a motorcycle, though. - This is legal. This is street legal. - Yeah, I've seen your ass on... - Shorty, oh, this legal? - I'm popping wheelies on this. - You popped a wheelie on this? - I'll do it right now. - On real, you did a wheelie on this? - I'll do it right now. - I swear to God. - Shorty, you're stupid-ass. Oh, I'm scared to even hop on this bitch while it ain't on. - You wanna ride this one? - Yeah. Teach me how to ride right now. On cap, teach me how to ride, I'm finna get on this bitch right now. - I swear to God. - He's gonna teach me how to ride! You scared for me to get on this, B? Why y'all layin' about all these bikes, bro? He crazy. But I ain't gonna lie, I love that nigga's focus. Where we come from, man, well, I know if I had some Juice WRLD money, I'd be buying way more than motorcycles. Man, little bitch. No cap much. My shorty's spending his sack so humbly. I ain't gonna lie, he really humbly spending his sack, bro. I was gonna say, he doesn't really spend his money on much. He know, I just said... I'm telling you he don't. - He's humbly spending his money. - Yeah, he really is. That nigga don't spend his money on shit, to be honest with you. 'Cause, look, if I went eight times platinum... ...I swear I'd be riding this bitch, acting brazy, blood, brazy. Ready, and action. Juice is gonna get both his nipples pierced... ...with a septum that connects all three. - Come here. - Septum right here. So, Gabe is about to get herpes tatted on him. Right above his little scar just as a reminder... - Herpes... - A reminder of how he fucked up. - My new rap name is Little Herp. - Little Herp! - G Herpo. - G Herpo. - Hey, that's fucked up. - Oh, fuck. Oh, wait. Hold on. We have some people with us here. Hey, you guys wanna be in my vlog? No consent needed, you're in it. - Only if it's a blog, not a vlog. - I mean, yo, he said he got... - Hernia. - So hopefully, he go get that fixed. He drink more water. Yo, fuck Ski's vlog. No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. - Yo, this is Rex. - Gang. Did it again. Great producer. - Endorses. - Ski's vlog. - Under endorsement. - Yo, I got too. What we got here, too?

That's how little man wanna see you, right? Keep that in the camera. When we both die, we gonna have somebody to put it out. Boy, you back on the dope? You weren't smoking last time I was with you, nigga. You was on the cup. I wasn't smoking. Ally, I was sipping so hard. Remember, when I... We was in London? - Chill, man. Chill, man. - I remember, I ain't even know... Lean is not allowed anymore in this house. So... That's the reason why. Fucking that time. - Excited to get back on the chain? - Hey, that was some shit, bro. I was high as hell, still freestyling, raw as hell. - What's this dog's name I heard? - That's Caplyn right there. They running. She be so confused. She be questioning life. It's like, "Is this real?" You got a pretty little face. - You got any more light in here? - That's what I was thinking. When you a fan of this shit, you look at it a certain way but then when you in this shit, you see it for what it really is. It's sad. This is a blessing, don't get me wrong. - I stained, I just got these, bro. - Oh, you stained this bitch. But it's sad. Like... it's...I don't know, it make you not want to, you know what I'm saying? Like, it's not what it look like. It's still a blessing, though, like, I'm still happy I get to change the world. I wanna change the world. To touch hearts all over the world, to influence, you know what I'm saying? It's a blessing. I thank God for that every day. But some of the stuff that come with this shit, though, it's just... It's a crunch, bro, and it's like, some people, I don't wanna say "sellout" is the right word, some people just give in to this shit. And they're not real. I think they get into this shit, they become a part of the environment, they become Hollywood. Sound like a broken TV, man. New York City, bitch. - I just smelled that camera. - How's it smell? Hey, fuckers, you stay right there! Where the next track? Sing this shit! So, we're on our way to Chicago. Chicago! 'Cause McDonald's hired a nigga to do shit. - So... - We ate McDonald's this morning. Yeah, we did. - I'm fucking with it. - Shit. I remember the day I shot "All Girls Are the Same." It was so... I don't know. Something like... fried. If I record, 24/7...Camera... don't press stop ever. Even if I shoot up heroin... gotta get it all on paper. Starting now. There, that's... - You want one? - Fine. I'll fuck with you. You're gonna capture all this. Hi. My name's Perky, and I came to play! Ally, baby?

Cool. That's a nice little ring you got on. Like she just got married. You just got married? Girl, you shining! I just got back from my mini-moon and came straight here. - Oh, congratulations. - Thanks, guys. It's nice when you get to marry your best friend, you know? - Even I understand. - It's fire. I ain't gonna even say nothing else after that. - I give the best presents. - Yeah. You definitely... Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you. - Wow, this is crazy. - I know I... So, we're gonna do a fireside chat. He's gonna interview you for 15 minutes and then the kids are gonna ask you questions. This discussion on how to achieve your dreams in the way like Juice did 'cause he was sitting in these same seats. My name's Anthony Lott. I'm 13, and my question for you is, what made you wanna, like, start doing music? In grade school, I did a lot of sports, I played basketball, I played baseball. I was just average- good, you know? There's 30 other people just as good as me if not better on the court. At music, I was over average, and I gave it my all and it came easy. So that's just something I always excelled in. Even when I was playing piano, playing guitar, whatever. Always just excelled in music. So, why not take it as far it could go? Yo, like, I...That shit... That's Coachella, stadium's-going-the-fuck-off shit. - That shit made my girl cry, bro. - Where is she? Herb, I was saying...I know you was talking about that. Oh, 'cause we were just having a conversation. Oh, bro, so when I was like... That's like one of my favorite songs I made. I had a lot of shit in my head and I was like, it was the first day I had... You know what, first day I had really, like, thought about, like... making better choices in life. And I was just like, when you trying to make a change, I don't know if this is what you all do, but this is what I do. If I'm trying to make a change in something, I'm trying to change myself in a way, I look at all the reasons why. So, like, the reason for... somebody to, to get sober is to be there for their family or to. To be there for their loved ones or whatever... When you sang, "My mama would never forgive me," I was like, "Damn." My girl, right? She's the type to worry. So, like, if something happens to me, she would never, you know what I'm saying? Or... she's the type that she don't want me to, like... Since I'm famous and everything is at my disposal, she don't want me to get tired of her. You know what I'm saying? That type of shit. So... But you know how, like, some people say drugs turn somebody's attitude and make somebody a different person. So, that's why I was like, "It's numbin' my feelings. If I let 'em kill 'em, my baby ain't never forgive me." - It was some real shit. - That be going over niggas' heads. Yeah, it's really on something. I say certain things so I could have conversations with my friends, Just like this, and we get to know each other better at the end of the day. Like, it's just like a... If people get it outside my circle then... And it relates to their life, there's enough for them to get that shit. This is going on my next album, bro. This shit hard. I say niggas give up their whole girl just to get a pic. I may puke today in front of everybody. My stomach, bro. Uh, I just want to take the time to thank everybody who supported me, and y'all have a lot to look forward to, 'cause some great things are coming pretty fucking soon. I'm really hyped, I'm really stoked, and just really pumped up. I'mma get this music shit all on deck, and see where it gets me, so... This is the dog I had in my crib right before I got famous. And I missed her so much. I bought my momma a crib, so came to see her. Pulled up on gang. This is really a great feeling, you know. You could buy your momma... You could repay your momma for everything that she did for you. - You feel me? - He's so happy. See, speaking of my momma. Here she comes right now. - Mom, come here. - Yeah. I was just telling everybody about your house... and the world. I got my momma a house. Of course, I'm gonna tell the world. Everybody put a heart up here, now will you! Put your hearts up. So you know... Since I wrote that song, a lot of my life has changed. And when the chorus comes back in... I'm gonna sing y'all the new lyrics. Come here. She told me put my heart In the bag And I will never get hurt I'm not running from her love I'm not fast I'm feeling better, not worse She got me covering the graves From my past I'm a whole different person She's a gift, not a curse So I don't wanna reverse it I wanna say we might've did six shows out in Australia. And it was, like, every show was like... It was like, we were trying to hit the 45-mark because that's what he was getting paid for. And it was like, I was pulling him to do it. I don't know if he thought that the plane was waiting on him soon as he got to the back door or something at the venue, but it was just like, it was so many fans there. That I was like, "Man, bro, we gotta make it through the setlist." I remember telling him this shit, "G, we gotta make it through the setlist." "Well, so, what else can we cut out, Mike?" "None of it. It's our last night here, bro." He still liked to sip Lean. But he didn't sip it as often because... Ally made that a thing that he couldn't do that anymore. So, Ally was pretty strict about that. But of course, he would still do it and he would hide it. And when he did get it, he would always be like, "Go pour me up this." You know what I mean? "Go take it up." He'd have to hide it in something wait till Ally's asleep and stuff. But he'd be like, "Pour me a four in this," or whatever, and I... I'd never pour him up what he thought he was pouring up, and then he'd be in there, like, "Pour a four in this," but then I really poured, like, a one. He'd really be pouring, like, a one in that and he wouldn't even know it. If Ally's in the studio, he'll text me like... I never forget this. "Go get a can of Sprite and pour a four." In a can of Sprite. Now, if niggas don't understand that terminology, a four is four ounces of Lean. Four ounces. You could pour one ounce in a soda, rock out with that, in a regular 20-ounce soda. This nigga drops fours in a canned-fucking-soda. What blew my mind was, I'm like, I'm reading the text like, "Oh..." Okay. I'm going out to fuck around and go get it, Chris Long out there, he like, "You about to go get the..." I'm like, "Yeah." You feel me? Like, you ...already know. And he like, "Yeah, don't pour four." "Don't pour him a four. Pour him a line and a half, if that. Do not pour four in that soda." Yo, what's up, guys? I'm Chris Long. Welcome to another vlog on my channel. As you know, I'm Juice WRLD's photographer and videographer, whatever, so... this weekend, we're going to Chicago to celebrate his birthday. It was just his birthday the other day, but we're going this weekend, Saturday. We're flying out there. We're gonna have a birthday party with his mom, and family, and friends and stuff like that from out there. We're getting ready to leave right now. Normally, I would just be around, but I had some errands to run because I was Juice's, like, personal cinematographer, but I also was his personal assistant. He had a pint of Lean, and it was hidden in my room. And when I got back to the house, that was gone. Then I know him and Ally were in the room and I could hear them fighting, 'cause he was really high. So while I was gone, I'm pretty sure he drank that whole pint by himself. And then in combination with the pills that he took... We calculated it up, and it was, like, over 20 pills a day he was doing. - Twenty Percocets a day? - Yeah. What's up. Check it out. All right, we are on our way to the airport right now. Going through a tunnel, and we're flying to Chicago. - Here we go. - That one's us, straight ahead. - Hello. - Hi. How are you? We were, like, six hours late for the flight. So right away, the pilot's probably pissed about that. I remember seeing the pilot do something that looked kind of... you know, weird, I guess. I remember just sitting down, he was just, like, kind of on the side. Just observing us. It was like the last flight out. We should've taken off pretty fast, but, like, we probably sat around for, like, 15 minutes before it took off. And I'm like, "Something's not right." - Lotta stars in this bitch. - Come get with the winning team, huh? Future right here. We ain't losing, man. We gamblin' with loaded dice. We can't lose. We gamblin' with loaded dice. And then, we finally took off. And then that was it. Before they got there, it was just regular. We drove right in and we were sitting there waiting, me and the drivers. As we was waiting, when... the wheels touch the ground, that's when I'm seeing cars pulling up. And I pretty much thought they were fans... 'cause they was marked cars, and then, until I seen a sheriff car. Then they also didn't tell me, like, it was an issue, 'cause I was questioning, like, what was going on, you know? And they wouldn't tell me anything. We knew there was police there before the plane landed because we got service. I knew he had his gun, and it was just...just throw it in my camera bag. And that was it, he had nothing to worry about. That's the point of an entourage. You know what I mean? Like, that's the point of having friends around that you trust. He had all the money in the world, everyone would've got out eventually. You know what I mean? Like, it is what it is. I remember walking off and seeing through the window all the police and shit. I'm thinking like, "What the fuck?" They say, "Everybody, get your passports out." So I was sitting down and Juice was sitting across from me, like me and you are right now. G Money was sitting right there. I remember... Juice and G Money shook hands. He, like, dapped up G Money. Which was sitting behind him, back-to-back in the same chair. Sorry, I have to close my eyes for this. And... I heard like a... I swear it was his demons leaving him. And he screamed "Ally!" And put his hands up to grab me, to reach for me, like, for help. And he seized up. And J had a seizure. He started having a seizure. He started having a seizure. Ally was trying to get him together, snap him out of it. I kinda froze. I didn't really know, like, what the fuck I could do to help, I was just sitting there, panicking and everyone was like, "What the fuck?" And at first, we just thought he was having a seizure, and then the blood started coming out... of his mouth, and his nose, and then... Everybody, obviously, started freaking out way more then. And then the police... came over to us all and handcuffed us all. And then they handcuffed us and was like, "Get the fuck away from him!" They handcuffed us all in a line except for Ally. Ally was like, yelling off, and... They cuff me, and they're telling Ally like, "Chill out. He's fine. Chill out. He's gonna be..." And we're all looking, like, "Bro, he's bleeding." That shit was fucking me up, seeing the blood come out his mouth. I kinda like, turned and closed my eyes. That shit was damn near almost made me cry, in a way. I don't know, I don't really cry for real, like, I ain't... so I, like, just turned away, and just seeing him, I don't know, imagine seeing somebody, you feel like your son, on the floor and blood, I'm damn near finna cry almost. Ally was trying to get him together, snap him out of it. She's yelling, screaming for someone to help, the cops for help. Did they help? No, not in time. It was slow. They took their time. That's what it seemed like. It didn't seem like there was any urgency with them. Thinking about it, he was probably gone, you know. Thinking about it. Right then and there. But they took him away. And shit. I don't think anybody really... I hadn't been in a situation like that, to have somebody having a seizure. I call my aunt. First thing I'm telling her is like, "Hey. Jarad's okay, but they're taking him. He just had a seizure. He's on his way to the hospital." I'm thinking he was okay. I told my aunt that. My nephew called and told me that... he had a seizure, and they were taking him to the hospital. That's like, 3:00 in the morning or so. Of course, I did. That's the last thing I expected, was a call like that. Yeah. I remember it quite well. That's one of those things you just, you know, I will never forget. And turn to the sudden and shocking death of rap star Juice WRLD. The 21-year-old, who was named Billboard's Best New Artist this year, suffered a medical emergency at Chicago's Midway Airport. Late Chicago rapper Juice WRLD died as a result of oxycodone and codeine toxicity. That's according to the Cook County Medical Examiner's office today. He suffered the medical emergency at Midway Airport as federal agents searched the luggage on board the private jet he was on. These startling pictures here obtained by TMZ show why federal authorities were taking a closer look at the flight. Seventy pounds of cannabis found inside 41 vacuum-sealed bags. In addition to the cannabis, authorities also discovered six prescription bottles of liquid codeine, three firearms, and metal-piercing bullets. And in another cryptic tweet he shared just last week, Juice wrote quote, "This life is yours. Do what the F you want to do, great things and change the world. Don't let no one tell you... and you'll be bigger than Juice WRLD will ever be, and he's going down as a legend." He knew. He knew. He knew, he fucking knew... You think he wanted to die? I do. I listen to all the music, man. And this, he said it in over 20-some songs. Over 30 songs, he said he wanted to die. And he freestyle, he don't write. He don't even take five seconds off to think about what he finna say. He just go straight... So, I think that's how he felt. He was so good at articulating his thoughts and feelings... we ain't really even, like, realized that that's the way he feeling, 'cause it's turned into so much beautiful art. He created something so precious with it, that it was hard to, like, separate the two. Like, even for him. That's what he loved to do. He loved to do everything that he did in life. He loved to... record, he loved to sit in the studio, he loved to stay up late, he loved to eat pizza, he loved to get high, like, that's what he loved to do. You feel me? And I loved to do it right with him, to be honest, like. When I'm having a good day, I used to drink Lean, smoke weed and pop pills. When I'm having a bad day, I used to drink Lean, smoke weed and pop pills. So it's hard to...You know what I'm saying. Separate it. I don't know what we're doing it for, we just doing it. The idea of no longer being on this earth anymore is such a...It's very simple, but it's also very complex. And I think the thought of it is easy to process but the reality of it isn't so easy to process. And I think that's something that, you know... that Juice was experiencing. He knew... Anyone in that position knows the results of what these things could be, but no one really processes what that actually means. And no one ever thinks that it's actually gonna happen. And I'm talking about Juice himself. Um... He got caught up in something that... he didn't know the power of. We ain't thinking about... the drugs, we takin' 'em... we just taking 'em. We ain't thinking twice about that shit. We comin' up from nothing. This is some shit we done, what we was doing back when we was fucked up and broke, just to maintain. It's like, you get some money, that don't mean your problems go away. So we still on the same shit, we just got more money to do it. So now you're doing that shit at a higher rate. I think he was having a tough time with just, like, the whole mix, how everything hit him all at once. 'Cause, like, once you start getting so much money, you could start doing so many things, and so many things start coming at you, like, at one time. You feel me? So, it's like, how do you even know how to control some shit like that? It really goes deep, you feel me? It gets deep. The abyss goes crazy, G. Really and truly. Talk to me about the abyss. Ah! Something that me and Juice talked about. We both...It's funny too, 'cause me and...me and Juice was...It's... me and Juice came to this terminology just by chopping it up with each other one day, and just talking about how, um... just like, how depression can go, you know what I mean? And how sad things can be and how, like, like far you can fall into that pit, you know, that abyss of darkness and like, just... It's hard to explain. Like, demons at play, basically, bro. The world is crazy, really and truly, and when you're in that mindset of the abyss, it's like, everything hits you harder, like... That's what he would say, he was like, "I feel just detached." And I'm like, "So, you don't..." Like, "You don't understand that you're like this idol, and like, all this, you don't see all that?" And he's like, "No, I do. But I feel like sometimes I can't feel it." "And I can't... Like it's not really there." We started talking about this thing that we both have. It's called depersonalization. And we just starting talking, you know, 'cause I had never... Before Juice talking about it... I didn't know what that was. And my whole life, I used to tell my family, like, "Yo, I don't feel real. Like, I feel, like, fake." And they used to... My family, they dumbass used to be like, "Oh, like, what? This moment is too good to be true?" I'm like, "No, it's not that at all. I literally don't feel real." So talking to him about it was kinda like... like a relief, in a way. Um... I...You know, just talking to somebody who understands you and understands what you're going through. I never really understand his music, 'cause it wasn't really for me, so I didn't understand, you know, what he was saying, but obviously his fans, they did. And there were just so many messages how he helped them with anxiety and depression, and some even said he stopped them from committing suicide, and it just... I was just overwhelmed. Something about his music just touched the hearts of people. You know, they could just relate to it and it made them feel better. One of the strangest days of my life. Juice was supposed to perform, but they turned it into a tribute show. And, you know, I'd never been in front of that. There was like, seventy-five thousand people, I think. And I went out there and just pressed play, and I just saw, like, every single kid singing every word. I don't even think he knew. I don't even think he knew how much he meant to all these kids. I really don't. Because you couldn't know. I didn't even know. Until, like...And I'm seeing the way these... these kids, like, crying their eyes out, singing every word. Whether he knew it or not, Juice was a therapist for... millions of kids... and gave them songs that... that helped them cope with... being alone, feeling like a loser, feeling depressed, not knowing how to express yourself, you know? And he was really, like, a voice of that generation. Everybody just wait. Wait! Did you think Juice would get as big as he did? Me, I always thought that. I think I was probably the only one, I don't even think Juice thought that. I always knew. As soon as I heard "Lucid Dreams," I'm like, we don't gotta do... Like, that song just... It was different, man. Like, it cut all the extra shit. Like, we skipped steps with that song. You skip...You know. That's one of them songs. His numbers was crazy as fuck even when he was alive. Keeping up, battling Drake and The Weeknd and shit, like, this nigga's over here, sword battling Drake for numbers and shit, so I'm like, "That's something serious." For somebody like Juice, come on, now, bro, that's crazy as fuck. Who was basically in the game for two years? Yeah! It was like, "Hello!" And they started doing crazy streams! Like, Drake-number streams. Like, I don't know, out of nowhere y'all just started liking Juice. Y'all probably don't even know what you all started liking Juice from. But out of nowhere, Juice WRLD was there, G. Juice's legacy will be... making incredible music that is timeless, being a phenomenal person... on and off the stage, in and out of the studio, being a family man, being a lover. That boy's a lover. That boy understands love more than a lot of people. That boy's a lover. Um... I think just being a well-rounded human being. You know, I think it goes beyond the artistry with Juice. I really do. And I think as time goes on as people appreciate him more and more... Because that's what happens, you know? That's how this goes. There's gonna be people who are Juice fans who aren't even born yet. You know, that's a beautiful thing. For the rest of my life, for the rest of your life, and for the rest of everyone's life who's watching this right now... every minute of every day for the rest of all of our lives, someone in the world will be playing a Juice WRLD song. He's here forever. Um... And he's not going anywhere. And that's what a legacy is, is leaving your music behind, and your impact, and your message behind for people to adapt... and then, you know, lead on with beyond that. And I think that's what Juice's legacy is. Where am I at I'm in paradise. I'm actually Facetiming, I'm not Facetiming, I'm just... I'm on Instagram live from heaven. I made it, y'all. I'm up here. I'm boolin'.
