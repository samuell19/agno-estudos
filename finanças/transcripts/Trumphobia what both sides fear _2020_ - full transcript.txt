I am officially running For President of the United States. And we are going to make our country great again. I want surveillance of certain mosques. I will build a great, great wall. Block funding for sanctuary cities. I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare. Suspend the Syrian refugee program. Our country is in serious trouble. Political correctness is killing this country. They're rapists and some, I assume, are good people. It's amazing the way I can talk people into things, right? I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters. Nothing he says or does can turn off voters. His campaign slogan might as well be, Trump 2016, you're stupid and ugly. Which Republican candidate has the best chance of winning the general election? Of the declared ones, right now, Donald Trump. It's fine, he's not gonna win anything. It's fine. Oh, it's very good news if you're in the Hillary Clinton camp. So right now, we have Hillary's about a 75% or an 80% favorite with... That high? Four polls that have Clinton up by more than 10 points. President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst President in the history of the United States, at least I will go down as a President. And we have our first projections of the night, take a look, Donald Trump we project will win in Kentucky. Donald Trump will take Ohio, Indiana. Donald Trump will win Alabama. Huge news, Donald Trump has won the State of Pennsylvania. Donald Trump will win the State of Utah. Wins Florida, Arkansas, Georgia. Louisiana. Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota. Montana, where Fox News can project. Oklahoma, Tennessee, Mississippi. North Dakota, Wyoming. Texas, Idaho. The State of Wisconsin, North Carolina. South Carolina. In Kansas, we can project a winner. In Missouri, Michigan. Donald Trump will carry Iowa, West Virginia, Arizona, and the State of Alaska. Donald Trump is the President of the U.S. Sorry to keep you waiting, complicated business. We created the bias response team to look into incidents of discrimination and harassment that are occurring because in the post-election climate, there's been an increase in incidents involving harassment, intimidation, and violence on the basis of people's religion or perceived religion, immigration status, gender identity, other areas of protection under our law. A spike in hate crimes across the country since Election Day. Also in the wake of the election, hate crimes are rising. From swastikas at a baseball field to Pennsylvania high school students shouting hate messages in the hallway and a throwback to the days of segregation. Donald Trump's supporters have also been the victims. You voted Trump, you voted Trump? Yeah! Donald Trump, white people, boy. The FBI defines a hate crime as a criminal offense against a person or property motivated by an offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity. Hate itself is not a crime, and it's protected by freedom of speech. The FBI is in charge of keeping records of hate crimes, and it needs at least a year to produce an accurate report. The problem is that there are several organizations and police departments across the country that are not doing a good job reporting these incidents. Trump people are feeling that they were aggrieved by not just Obama's policies but the way that liberals treated them and the way they look down on them. And now they've got their time and they're gonna do their thing. And the liberals are going, "You guys didn't win this right and we're gonna pay you back." Everybody's so mad at each other, everybody's so engrossed in trying to get the payback back and forth, that sometimes they lose track of what they're fighting for, and all they want to do is win and get those other guys back and make those other guys feel bad. Okay, what about all these people being racist to me right now? What about that? Donald Trump doesn't give a fuck about you guys. That's the saddest part. That's it. Anybody with that much money doesn't give a fuck about you guys. We are all Americans, so get out of my face! - You're fighting with- - Get out of my face! Right now! Get out of my face! So what's up? What's up? Who gonna do what to me? I'll go out, I'll go out before I do that, so what's up? What we see happening under Donald Trump is very scary, but it continues what was very much in full order under the Democrats. We're seeing these people step out into the public and spew their hateful rhetoric. Sometimes it's worse than rhetoric. Sometimes it's physical violence. The date of the incident, it was November 17th, which was a Thursday. I ordered an Uber early in the morning, and Muhammad showed up as being my driver. We kind of, halfway into the ride, kind of became buddy-buddy a little bit, and that's when I asked him how the post-election or how the election environment had treated him because I had seen things in the news. And I have a lot of friends who are Muslim-Americans but are not necessarily being discriminated against every day, so I'm interested to ask these questions. And he responded to me, "You know, it's better for me to show you rather than tell you." Trump is President, asshole, so you can kiss your fucking visa goodbye, scumbag. They'll deport you soon, don't worry, you fucking terrorist. The video just blew me away because I wasn't expecting anything to contain so much vitriol, hatred, intolerance, and just plain ignorance, really. Fucking Arab motherfucker, terrorist, fucking cocksucker. I don't care, bro, video. You're a loser! You're not even from here, you motherfucker. So I said, that's a video that needs to be seen by more than just myself in the backseat of your car. This should be, if nothing else, given to the media or to the police or something, and be investigated as a hate crime. Appears to be another bias incident in New York City. Several local leaders say the incidents have spiked after the presidential election. He told me, "You have to respect me." I turned to him and I said to him, "You have to respect the road, and that's it." Mohammed went around the man. A block away, here at the corner of 41st Avenue and Crescent Street, the other driver began his tirade. Fuck you and your family, you terrorist fuck. Video all you want, you're an Arab. You're a fucking loser, sand nigger. The America that I was raised to believe in is very much an America where no matter who you are, as long as you work hard and play by the rules, we're all equal. And these types of behaviors and xenophobic overreactions, especially to people who are American citizens, are more detrimental to the country than they are beneficial. Because if you want to radicalize anybody who's a Muslim, make them feel unwanted, make them feel hated and that they don't belong here. That's how you're gonna recruit somebody who's gonna become ISIS. If you want them to not do that, you just treat them like you're equal. Look, I used to be a liberal. I used to be a liberal like you. I'm not brainwashed anymore, homie. Hey, I'm a Latino and I voted for Trump. There's a lot of Trump supporters that are in the closet or are not very outspoken and are very silent. Why? It is because we saw the violence that was happening to Trump supporters from the beginning. - Then what? - That's good. - That's a good start. - Then what? Yeah, it's a good fucking start. It is a good start. You don't like Trump, why? I'm just asking, why? - I am. - Okay, I got it. All right, that's it. There's a lot of hate on the opposition side coming from the liberals and the Democrats. They do attack us. I personally have been assaulted. Got it. Whoa! What the fuck? I see some damage on your left cheek. What happened? He hit me with a skateboard. - Okay, shh! I need it quiet so I can hear him, go! - He hit me with a skateboard. - Okay, what did he look like? Shoot, I didn't even see who hit me. Somebody came right on the side. It's unfortunate that these people have to resort to violence, but I believe that they resort to violence because that's all they have. They have no discussion, they have no argument, they have no debate because they are very misinformed. Now, if there is or has been a case where there has been a Trump supporter that has committed violence against the opposition, I'm totally against it because that's not what we're all about. That is not right. We have the right to express ourselves just like as well as they do. It was about a week and a half after the election and I found the graffiti. We saw swastikas. We saw Trump's name. We knew that this needed to be taken care of by more than just reporting it to the park. So I called Senator Daniel Squadron's office. He's one of our state senators locally, and they got right on it. They got the parks department involved. They had people over right away, removing the graffiti as quickly as possible. They also organized a rally in response, and they created a reaction of love. Thousands today rallied here to send the message that hate will not be tolerated, and they got some help from a music legend. Keep your eyes open, stand up for each other, don't be afraid to step in or enlist the help of others because this is homegrown terrorism, for real. Beastie Boys' Adam Horovitz, better known as Ad-Rock, leading a rally in Brooklyn's Adam Yauch Park. I feel that this election has given a voice to hateful people. It's one thing to be conservative in your politics, but when it devolves into truly hateful speech, calling people names, telling people to go home, that's not the United States that I ever imagined we lived in. People are feeling threatened. They no longer feel that this a democratic safe space. There's a disconnect in decency in this country now. I guess it was maybe a week after the election, and it was a swastika graffiti on the window down at the fur place. - Some racist graffiti referencing President-elect Trump has been removed from a South Philadelphia storefront. The graffiti, which included swastikas and offensive language, comes on the 78th anniversary of Kristallnacht, when Jews were attacked. People on the block and around the area wrote on the sidewalk, "Accept and protect your neighbors" ultimately with chalk, trying to turn it into a positive. As far as this election, I think we all thought people had those thoughts. They were all there. Their ignorance has always been there, and I think the scariest thing is that now we have to, as a society, accept that hatred people want to spew. On June 2nd, 2016, I went to a Trump rally in San Jose, California, and at the Trump rally, I had gotten attacked, me and several other dozens of Trump supporters. There were violent clashes between protesters and supporters of Donald Trump outside an appearance by the candidate. Trump supporters leaving the San Jose Convention Center were surrounded, taunted, and attacked by anti-Trump protesters. Some punched, some chased down and beaten. Others had bottles thrown at them. That's not how you get your message across, is by being so forceful and aggressive. You have to work with people in order to get anything done. Our next guest is a Latino Trump supporter who actually attended Thursday night's rally and who went home with a broken nose, a mild concussion, and his clothing looking like this. Look at this, just for supporting his presidential candidate of choice, Donald Trump. I'm trying to stay up as they're hitting us, and you can just feel the blows coming on every single side of you and I could feel scratches. And, finally, at some point, I knew, my survival mode, I had to get up and I had to do something. So I turned around and I struck and I hit one guy, and I could see that fist coming and it clocked me right in the nose. And the blood just started pouring like that. And people stood back, I think they were in shock, and so I grabbed my friend and we started running, running over here to the parking garage. So after we're running in here, thinking that we now got away from the protesters, as we're walking in, we could see a whole 'nother mob down there of people. There was about three cars that were waiting in line to come out, but as you can see, there's a gate and so people were just stopped there. And now, at this point, now the protesters see us. The protesters shaking cars, breaking tail lights. Protesters attacked Trump supporters' cars in the parking garage as they tried to leave. They were like animals, like monkeys on these cars. And I'm thinking, just go, just go through it. The police aren't doing anything. When we standing there, my friend was driving because I couldn't drive. I was lightheaded at this point 'cause so much blood was coming. I told him, push your pedal, go. Just push the cars and they will go out. You have just desperation because am I gonna die or not? It's not okay and this can't set a precedence that this is gonna continue the next time, no matter who you vote for, Hillary or Bernie or Trump. It doesn't matter who you vote for. This isn't supposed to happen. My name is Chuck Redding, I'm 75 years old, and right now, it's a good time of the year for me to wrap Christmas presents for people, but the circumstances being now that it's a little bit rougher for me to do it with only one hand. Chuck Redding says he was followed home by someone after dropping off a friend, and he believes that person was targeting him all because of the stickers on the back of his car. I saw him get out of his car in my rearview mirror and come up and he started beatin' on the window. And he said, "Our new President says that we can kill all you faggots now." Excuse me? It was probably about 6:30 and I was coming down the main street, and I noticed that this car was behind me. And I thought, I don't know what this dude's problem is. So I stopped in the middle of the street, windows were up. Unfortunately, the car door was not locked, and he says, "You get what you deserve..." or something to that effect. Yanked the door open, pulled me out. He had ripped my shirt and everything, and I was on the ground, and I started to get up, and I jumped up and I started to chase him, and while I was chasing him, I realized that his back window on the passenger side was open. And I was trying to grab it and he flew backwards maybe 40 miles an hour, squealing, and when he turned his car to go around that curve, he caught me on the side of the leg and knocked me off balance. He didn't hurt me then but I went down and I went down hard. And this hand, it's been over a month now, and it's still not healing correctly. The people who voted for Trump have no mind of their own, I'm sorry to say that. I don't understand. The only thing that I would ask him is, what did I do to you? Who are you? I don't know you, but I must have done something to you for you to hate me like this. They have a group called Antifa, okay? The Antifa's those ones that wear all the black, okay? Those are the people that are the problem. They are going out attacking Trump supporters. I've had to hold my composure out there in these protests, several times. I've been kicked. An old lady kicked me and spit on me. You shouldn't put your hands on nobody because of their own personal opinion. Everybody is different in the world. Everybody is not gonna agree on the same thing. I might like green beans, you might not like green beans, but if I'm gonna beat you up because you don't like green beans, no. You do not attack somebody because of their own personal preference. It doesn't matter if other people believe different things than we do. We're all part of the same community here. And anytime anyone hears some intolerance or is aware of some hateful behavior or bigoted behavior, we should denounce it. If it's a crime, we should report it to the police. We should contact the elected officials. In that way, if we organize the community, I think there's a better chance that people realize that this is unacceptable behavior. It is very challenging to identify the number of discriminatory harassment incidents that have occurred since the election, but it's important information for us to have because we wanna know what's happening and where it's happening, so that we can again be out in communities, talking to people, seeing what the needs are and also collecting the data. If these things go unreported, we'll never have a true sense of what's going on. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, in the 10 days after the November 8th election, 867 cases of intimidation and harassment were reported across the country, and the highest number of incidents happened the day after the election, mostly in public spaces and educational environments, towards immigrants, black people, and the LGBT community. Even though this data goes along with publications from hundreds of people on social media, police reports, and news clips, there are still several concerns about this research. The Southern Poverty Law Center explains that they couldn't verify all these incidents, yet news companies like The Washington Post, USA Today, and other major media immediately quoted this data to highlight a spike in hate crimes. But most of these incidents are not even crimes. They are hateful messages but not legal crimes. Later in time, it was found that several of these cases were not related to Trump's election, and many were made up completely. What's more concerning is that in February 2017, ThinkProgress released another study that reported 261 hate incidents across the country since November 9th, and out of those, 42% were directly related to Trump's victory. Even though ThinkProgress and SPLC have some differences in their criteria, these numbers are significantly different. All of this information was published months before the FBI released their official data from 2016, which confirmed a spike in hate crimes since 2015. But they didn't find a link between Trump's election and the increase. There is no doubt that there were legitimate reports of hate crimes and hateful incidents against different people, especially minorities, and even one is too many, but hyping the data and suppressing inconvenient information gives a bias and misleading perspective of the post-election conflict. This mix of information works as fuel for potential violence in a divided America. And on top of this, Trump has not addressed this issue well enough, and he has been criticized for not taking responsibility for his rhetoric. If it helps, I will say this, and I'll say it right to the camera, stop it! I think it's correct for Donald Trump to say things the way he says things. I think that he's misunderstood in the way that he says certain things, and I get it. I feel like I get Donald Trump. I've worked with men like Donald Trump. Yes, his words are brutal, but at least he's honest and he's real. I believe that we need somebody in office that's gonna be tough, that's gonna be speaking the truth, even if it hurts. More than anything, I believe that he's just being assertive and he's standing up for our country. I believe that the leadership does have a responsibility to unify, especially the President of the United States has a responsibility to unify the United States. I don't think that they are responsible or should be held accountable to the people's behavior because we all have a choice in how we want to act. If I thought Trump was a bigot or a racist, I would not be supporting him, but I don't see that. I see him saying certain things and then having people exaggerating it. I'm sure everybody has let somethin' slip out of they mouth that they shouldn't let slip, a couple of times in they life. So stop bein' harsh on the man, okay? He has to show a strength of power because if not, those other international people gonna think we have a weak President, a weak, passive President, okay? But we need a man that's strong and speaks his mind, and that's what he's doing. I think the majority of the rhetoric out there right now is coming from the media. I'm very angry at the media because they manipulate and they deceive people, and it makes us make irrational decisions. I personally do think that the media has also cherry-picked things that he's said. And if you listen to, for instance, the entirety of a certain speech and you listen to the context of what he said before and the context of what he said after, when he says certain things, then you get why this one sentence that they play over and over and over, on ABC News or whatever, sounds so bad, but when you listen before and after, you get it. Donald Trump and animals. For the last two days, the President of the United States has been trying to rewrite some people into animals. We're taking people out of the country. You wouldn't believe how bad these people are. These aren't people, these are animals. It's no surprise that the left-wing media hates President Trump, but this next story might be one of the most grotesquely irresponsible examples yet. During yesterday's Sanctuary State Roundtable, the President was asked about the dangerous MS-13 gang. The mainstream press, including The New York Times, USA Today, Washington Post and many others, took Trump out of context, suggesting he called all illegal immigrants animals, not just MS-13. What did the President mean when he said some immigrants are not people, they're animals? The President was very clearly referring to MS-13 gang members who enter the country illegally and whose deportations are hamstrung by our laws. Yep, we have people coming into the country or trying to come in, we're stopping a lot of 'em, but we're taking people out of the country. You wouldn't believe how bad these people are. These aren't people, these are animals. We have this bifurcated media where people can go and listen and read information that supports just what they want to believe. So liberals can go to MSNBC and The New York Times, and conservatives can go to Fox News and The Wall Street Journal and never really encounter the other side of the aisle. Conflict is a great business model. Nobody watches a television show where everybody gets along. They want people to fight. And you can make money that way. But it's just terrible for the country. It's terrible if we're trying to establish a consensual view of what the basic facts on the ground are. - Racist trash! - Breitbart is racist trash! Selling fear. Stay back. You're brainwashed. Can you give me one minute to just say something? - Yes, please. - Yes! Can you give me one minute? I am not against anybody. Listen to me. You guys have the right to protest just as they do. I would hope you keep it peaceful, so I don't have to call a whole squad of cops out here. - If you have to call- - Hang on a second. No. I would rather they patrol and do their jobs than to stand out here and monitor a peaceful protest! - We're here peacefully. - But it can only be peaceful if you guys keep it peaceful! Okay? That's all I'm asking! Thank you, sir, thank you, sir. All right, thank you. The media has played an enormous role not only in Trump's rise to power but in his maintenance of power. And this was said very clearly by the president of CBS News during the election campaign, when CBS was criticized by having Trump on all the time, constantly putting Trump's image on, therefore giving him more power, activating his views and his thoughts and his language in the brains of people watching. And what the president of CBS news said was, "This may be bad for the country, but it's very, very good "for the profits of CBS," and this is true. It turns out that when Trump does something outrageous and then the press debates it for days, it turns out it gets higher ratings. People watch those debates and it's Trump all day long. He knows how to control the media. According to MediaQuant, in a 12-month period until Election Day in 2012, Obama received above $1 billion in media value. In 2016, Hillary received 3.24 billion but fell behind Trump who had a total free media value of $4.96 billion. Shut up, I was not talking to you! That's a Democrat liberal acting like a fool. At least I didn't grab anybody's pussy. You don't want to debate. You're so full of yourself and shove people down. I was listening but you didn't let me finish. No, the thing is they would not let me finish. Every few seconds, just like Donald Trump did to Hillary Clinton at the debate, you wanted to say, wrong this, that, the other. And guess what? He's President now. - It worked. - She lost! Thank you very much, now here's the deal. I don't care if you are a... If you went out around the world and you asked people, who's more biased, liberals or conservatives? It would really depend on who you asked, right? Liberals would say conservatives are more biased, and conservatives would say that liberals are more biased, and that's kind of the state of the world that we're in. So we did a study that's called a meta-analysis where you take the results of lots of studies that have been done and you statistically combine the results to try and get a better sense of what the body of research says. We found that both sides are biased significantly to sort of a moderate extent. They're more willing to accept a piece of information as true if it supports their political views than if it doesn't. And both liberals and conservatives are biased, and they're biased to almost the identical degrees. Donald Trump was actually not elected by the American people because the majority of the American people elected Hillary Clinton. It was actually- That's not true. You're right, you're right, you know what? You are right, but guess... The popular vote is not important. The electoral votes are important. That's why she lost. Donald Trump won because he got 307 and she got 230. She wasn't even close to winning. She had to win to 270, so the popular vote, she got the popular vote because of California 'cause California's full of minorities, that's why. But the bottom line, the Americans voted for Donald Trump. That's why he won. People think they think like scientists when they really think like lawyers. Scientists will think from the ground up. You take sets of facts and you follow those facts wherever they lead you. Attorneys, on the other hand, have some conclusion that they want to reach and then they harness facts to try to support that conclusion. We think about ourselves as rational creatures when we're really much more emotional, and those feelings change the way we make judgments. Our moral evaluations change our factual beliefs. And when somebody believes something very different from what you believe, there's two sort of common reactions. You must be either stupid or you're lying or are deluded somehow. Neither of those things are good ways to make friends and influence people. And that's what I think creates a lot of conflict as well. Not only does it impede progress toward policy, but it makes people dislike each other because of these kind of, you know, I can't understand why you believe that. - Go away. - Tell me, tell me right here. Okay, okay, she just said to me that I don't belong here. I'm a citizen. How dare you talk to me? - She's a racist. - You're a racist. Last night, we were at Santa Monica Promenade where we were gonna have an event where we can engage other people. We actually had two microphones, and we were allowing the liberals or the Democrats or the opposition to have a voice, and in order that we can debate and bring up issues. We are not out there to make anybody believe anything, but what we found, for the most part, is getting assaulted, getting cursed out by the opposition, and that's very unfortunate. I was very scared that Hillary would be President because she wanted to bring more illegal immigrants here. She also wanted to bring Muslim refugees here. We know and I know what's been happening in Europe, and after Donald J. Trump became President, I felt a lot safer because I knew his agenda was to protect the American people from illegal immigrants and from Muslim refugees. So I very much felt very comforted and very safe and till this day that our President, Donald J. Trump, is gonna keep us Americans safe. So that's why I feel so much necessary to go out there and continue to protest, continue to rally, and continue to promote him, so it could be easier for him to be reelected with facts and with my life experiences and exposing the truth. I think Republicans need to be better at the narrative, explaining why. Oftentimes, I feel like the values are being attacked from the other side, and therefore, you have to speak up. When you speak up, you need to do it in the right way or else you're gonna be seen as the hater, which is so untrue. People think Republicans are such bad, awful people. We've been ridiculed, we've been demonized. It's a strategy. We know better, we know who we are. Trump needs to be very careful. I think that whenever you're putting anything out there, you're taking a risk that it can be misunderstood. But we know how Trump is. We know he's gonna be unorthodox. He's out there, this is who he is. Basically, I think it's the spirit of the Tea Party, whether you call yourself Tea Party or not. It's that spirit of the Tea Party that got Trump elected because we saw what was happening on the left, and it was very, very scary, and it still is. I, myself, living here in West Hollywood, which is a very left-wing city, especially because I'm a public safety commissioner, I'm an appointed official, I've been pretty quiet. I don't express my views here. And the times that I have, I get a lot of pushback, and people's tempers flare. I think the worst comes out in people when they feel scared. I'm not personally afraid, no, but I'm also not going around wearing the red hat or the shirt or anything like that. I know where I live. If I did that and I showed up at a protest march or something that was against Donald Trump and I showed up with my red hat, yeah, I'd probably feel a little nervous. Where I live, here in the Bay Area, you can't go around walking, telling people that you're a Republican, let alone a Trump supporter, and it shouldn't be that way because the other side can say who they were. When I came out when I was gay, I told some friends, then I told my parents, and then I told some family members. You kind of tell people like that, you know? You don't come out with this party, hi, I'm gay. You tell people and so it eases in to it. Coming out as a Republican is by far worse than coming out as gay, and especially because it happened at one time that it was just this influx of hate that I got. It was exactly what I thought was gonna happen. That's why I was an in-the-closet Republican Trump supporter because I feared what happened and what is happening. When people go to the polls, they should be able to vote for what it is we want, but instead we've been conditioned to vote against what we're most afraid of. What does that say about our democracy that the main question in our mind is, who do we hate the most? And you go and you vote against that person. That does not move us forward. Democracy needs a moral compass. It needs a positive agenda. That's what we need to restore by having a real democracy that's working for us. People are absolutely right to be cynical about the government that's been inflicted on everyday people, but the solution to that is not to descend into darkness and militarism and violence. The solution to that is to take back our democracy and restore our human values on which all of our lives depend. When Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the House in the early 1990s, he sort of came in on this wave of Republican revolution and shrank the congressional work week to three days, so people stopped living in Washington, D.C. And so it used to be the case that congressist people, they were neighbors. Their kids played soccer together. They had barbecues together. They went out and drank beer together. It's harder to demonize somebody if you know them, but if I've never met you, I've barely had any contact with you, that's when it's much easier to demonize somebody who you don't know. And so those kind of simple ideas about, well, maybe we should expand the work week, maybe we should get people living back in Washington, well, maybe something like that would work. I think the real problem in American politics is the lack of self-awareness. 9/11 had an effect where it kind of brought people together, maybe temporarily, but it did have that effect of bringing people together. So an external attack on the United States, historically, the sort of thing that changes the game. It takes two sides that are fighting against each other as enemies and say, well, gee, now we have to join together to fight a common enemy. Those things sort of stop a political polarization that we're experiencing. I'm not sure that would happen today, that the polarization is so bad that's it's not clear that an attack on the United States wouldn't get sucked into that vortex again and get polarized, where the right views it in one way and the left views it another, and people start blaming each other for what's happening. And that's what worries me the most, is that we're past some point at which external events can easily bring us back together and unite the two sides. The first thing to understand about contemporary politics or any politics at all is that politics is moral. It's about morality. It's about right and wrong. So if anybody who's running for office or is in politics says, "Here's my proposals, do what I say", then the assumption is it's right, not wrong. They never say, "Do what I say because it's evil or it's awful or it doesn't matter." The assumption is they think it's right and that's important because politics has to do with your moral worldview, but mostly your moral worldview is unconscious. You're not always aware of how you understand the world from a moral perspective. You just have a sense of right and wrong, even though it's being carried out by your neural circuitry. The way it works is this, morality comes out of family models, nurturant-parent family for progressives and a strict-father family for conservatives. A progressive family, you have a mother and a father who are both equally responsible for the household and raising the child. They have to be empathetic toward their children. And this is something that Barack Obama said very clearly, that it's the duty of parents and particularly fathers to make sure that they empathize with their children and they teach their children to empathize with others because otherwise you'll get a generation of people who don't care about anybody else. And that's a very progressive view. Now, the conservative worldview, that arises from a strict-father family, and it says, father knows best, he knows right from wrong. And because he knows best, his word is law. What he says is taken as being true. And he has the authority and the power within the family to say what's right and wrong and to reward and punish. If you believe in a strict-father morality, what that says is that those who are right, who are most powerful in the world, are powerful because they have the right morality. All of that comes out of moral worldviews, and we see that in the split in the country today. What's particularly interesting about this is that a lot of people are not strictly one or the other. There are people who are called moderates. A moderate is someone who is mostly one but partly the other, mostly say progressive but with some conservative views or other. But there's no worldview of the moderate that all moderates agree on. There's no center. Now, how can you have contradictory moral worldviews in a single brain? And the answer is very simple. Each worldview, when turned on, turns the other one off. Language activates a given moral worldview, and the more you hear it, the stronger it gets. What that means is that if you are constantly exposed to conservative discourse, if you start out as a Democrat, you'll be moving more and more to the right. What is Trump about? He obviously has strict-father values and he wants to be the most powerful strict father in the world. It means that he believes that the world should be run his way. In order for that to happen, he has to maintain his income and being popular. And it doesn't matter what his connections to Russia are. It doesn't matter whether he tells the truth or not. All those things are secondary to the idea that America is going to be run the way you morally think it should be run. That is what Trump supporters believe. Under Obama, those folks lived in a country where the President was against their world views and, therefore, their identity. And similarly, progressives, when Trump was elected and given what he's done, feel oppressed as well. There is a resistance out there. There is a large movement to change this. Why? Because people feel that they must do something to change it. They feel oppressed to such a degree that they feel democracy is being taken away from them, and everything they value is being taken away, and they have to do something. Excuse my language, but on three, we gonna say, fuck Trump! One, two, three! Fuck Trump! One, two, three! Fuck Trump! One, two, three! Fuck Trump! Following Trump's election, large protests were held in several major cities across the United States and in some countries around the world. Thousands of protesters participated in each city in the form of walkouts, business closures, petitions, rallies, demonstrations, and marches. You just pushed a woman! Not my President! Not my President, not my President! According to Crowd Counting Consortium, only in 2017, it is estimated that between six and nine million people protested in the U.S., and 89% of these people were protesting Trump or his agenda. Since the Women's March in 2017, which is considered the biggest single-day protest in the history of the U.S., until the end of that year, over 8,700 protests were listed. It is our duty to win. It is our duty to win. We must support and love each other. We must support and love each other. We have nothing to lose but our chains. We have nothing to lose but our chains. It is our duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to fight for our freedom. We are a state of mind. We are the future! Fists up, hearts open! Fists up, hearts open, fists up, hearts open! Fists up, hearts open, fists up! No ban, no wall, sanctuary for all! No ban, no wall, we stand for all! No ban, no wall, we stand for all! Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here! Say it loud, say it clear, Mexicans are welcome here! Say it loud, say it clear, Mexicans are welcome here! What I learned at Standing Rock is that when people are united, not in anger, not in hatred, but with love, there is no challenge we cannot overcome! We do not need to resist because we are standing. Raise your hand if you're standing. Raise your hand if you're standing. There are fighters in these streets. There are warriors in our households. We are here to fight! Donald Trump doesn't give a damn about whether or not you can take your child to the doctor. This is about money! The $500 billion that are supposed to be cut out of the spending for Obamacare is $500 billion worth of tax rebates that are going back to the richest corporations in this nation. Do you believe that healthcare is a fundamental human right? Then we're here today to save Obamacare, and this is just the beginning. We're just starting the fight. Today's the kickoff. Get ready, we're gonna go to work! The fact that thousands of people, with very little notice, came out into the streets of Los Angeles to demonstrate in favor of the Affordable Care Act and against Trumpcare is not insignificant, and we're only gonna build on that. We are gonna continue to fight for health as a human right. I think since Donald Trump's election, there has been a significant increase in fear in the communities that we serve in South Los Angeles. St. John's Well Child and Family Center is the largest provider of healthcare services to undocumented immigrants in the United States, so obviously we feel like we're at the epicenter of all the anxiety that's been created as a result of the election. Many of our patients are becoming depressed. They're worried. Many, many people are afraid that they're gonna be separated from their families. So we've been providing a lot of behavior health and mental health counseling to our patients as well as just general education for them to know their rights, so that we can reduce that anxiety level. We're not asking for Trump voters to send us money. There are plenty of other folks who make contributions to St. John's as a charity and support providing healthcare to the poor and to the undocumented and to the immigrant. We're gonna have to keep building the resistance to taking away people's healthcare and continue to build a constituency so that people understand that healthcare is an important right and that people will fight for it. One of the things that began to come out of the rhetoric during the campaign were some of the young people were going to school and they asked the teachers the question, "Does that mean I got to leave my home?" And even some of the kids, what they heard around the table, they would come to school and they would talk about it. We have to educate our children. We got to let them know there are hateful words that people use and they don't even understand the meaning of 'em. They repeat them because their parents spoke them. Parents must become held accountable for what they say. We got to stop allowing hatred to be resuscitated. We gotta continue to speak peace, and so it is about participation, collaboration, and having that conversation and become engaged in the politics around you. I think I speak on behalf of a lot of caring and thinking people in North Carolina and around the country when we say we're very fearful of a Trump presidency. I'm not embarrassed to say that I cried my eyes out at three o'clock in the morning after the election result. So though I work for a nonpartisan organization, we don't endorse candidates, I have very strong feelings personally about our country's future and deep-seated fears about what a Trump presidency means. It's a remarkable position for a politician to find him or herself in, and frightening, I suppose, in some respects for the rest of us that people are so seemingly intensely loyal to this man that they're willing to cheer him when he says one thing and then when he says the opposite, to cheer him as well. But I don't think it should surprise any of us. The man has been a charlatan and a salesman his whole life, and has made it sort of a faith for him that he says whatever it takes to get whatever he wants. When you're talking about the KKK and other racist hate groups, North Carolina has a long, troubled history. It's depressing and of concern that groups like that would feel at all empowered, but the rise of Donald Trump has given at least some of those people a feeling that they are now free to come forth and spew vitriol and hate towards other people. Virginia's governor declared a state of emergency in Charlottesville today as white nationalists clashed in the streets with counter-protesters. Groups, including the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis, came from across the country to rally against plans to remove a Confederate statue from a park. The violence included an apparent attack with a car on a crowd of peaceful protesters. At least one person was killed. This all took place a short distance from the University of Virginia. Incidents today were predated by three other major rallies there. Last night, torch-wielding white supremacists marched through the University of Virginia campus. In July, 50 members of a North-Carolina-based KKK group traveled to Charlottesville for a rally, where they were met by hundreds of counter-protesters. And in May, prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer protested there as well. We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides, on many sides. Are you putting what you're calling the alt-left and white supremacists on the same moral plane? I'm not putting anybody on a moral plane. What I'm saying is this, you had a group on one side and you had a group on the other, and they came at each other with clubs and it was vicious and it was horrible and it was a horrible thing to watch, but there is another side. There was a group on this side, you can call them the left, you've just called them the left, that came violently attacking the other group. So you can say what you want, but that's the way it is. In some respects, when you talk about hate groups like the Klan and other racist outfits, they've always sort of been there under the surface, so an optimist might say, well, at least Trump has helped force them out into the open so they're there. We're gonna combat them. We're gonna not pretend they don't exist. We're gonna have to engage and explain and expose these people as being wrongheaded and ignorant. And I suppose that's my hope that will happen, that by forcing them out into the open, we'll be able to shine a light on this cancer and see that it ultimately dies off. But it's gonna take a while, so these are challenging times. No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA! No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA! No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA! No Trump, no KKK! No fascist USA! No Trump! People are experiencing a big wake-up moment right now, and we see millions of people out in the streets like we haven't seen in generations. I think people feel like they have been thrown under the bus, and this is when people become very susceptible to demagogues and to fascism. This is how fascism has always risen, when people are very economically stressed and they've lost faith in our social institutions and our institutions of government. Then you get big manipulators like Donald Trump, who can connect with people emotionally, so in many ways, it is the policies of the Democrats that have actually given rise to this right-wing extremism that we see now under Donald Trump. Hey, hey, it's not okay to fight! Call the cops! I need to wipe it, I need to wipe it! I was trying to save somebody who was being attacked by the Trump people and on the ground, and as I ran towards it, I hit a cloud of pepper spray. And some comrades dragged me away, gave me first aid, and now here I am. They're throwing bombs at us. They're throwing glass candles at us. Right, they're throwing bombs at us. They were grabbing some of our guys, the scuffle... Fuck! I came today prepared for violence from either side. I came with medical bandages, gauze, milk to neutralize pepper spray. I've bandaged both Antifa and Liberty Patriots today. You're allowing the violence to escalate. It's on you guys for not doing anything except sitting here like cowards. We're the Empathy Tent. We offer empathic listening to people. We're trying to get people to have dialogue, first to listen to them, then to bring them into dialogue because, really, the only way forward is listening, empathy, and dialogue. And then, like we say here, it's the basis for people getting together and really addressing what their needs are and really solving problems. All the people screaming and yelling at each other, they're actually saying, "Listen to me, listen to me!" And the other side's saying, "No, listen to me!" "I wanna be heard!" So they're both really asking for listening, so there's a deep down, just biological need that we all have to be heard and seen, and so we're trying to kind of address that for everyone, and also give people the tools of how they can listen to each other because if you just start dialoguing, sometimes that can break down. But if you have some rules, some processes, some tools, a facilitator, it can kinda help that process. People can then learn it, they internalize it, and then they can become better listeners in their families, in their communities, so we feel that there needs to be a voice out to stand for that. Do we need to disperse? Build the wall! No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA! Go back to Europe! We see division and conflict everywhere around the country, between the Trump side and the progressive side, so after what we saw and experienced in Berkeley, we decided we needed to take the Empathy Tent to as many political confrontations as possible. So the next big event we went to was the Impeachment March in Los Angeles. We went and actually set up an Empathy Tent at this rally to offer listening to two sides that were there and have them dialogue with each other and really share how they were feeling about the impeachment issue as well as some other issues as well. So I was really taken that people were really grateful to have this opportunity to dialogue. We need more dialogue right now 'cause we're, in some ways, on the edge of a civil war. It could escalate very easily. Somebody could get injured and they becomes martyr to either side. I feel what you're doing here today and what we all can do, what you're doing speaking to the other side, I think that's wonderful. There's definitely a need for that. Would you like to share what you heard? Again, I wish we had more opportunities to speak, and the young man I was speaking to said that the police wouldn't let them cross the street to come to us, approach us, and I was like, oh, well, that's sad. I can understand during the march, but once we're at the location, you should be able to come over and kinda dialogue and talk because emotions without thought are dangerous, you know? I guess my greatest fear is that there's a large division within the nation of fundamental differences that people are really not likely to agree on. It's tough because I have family members that disagree with me. And this country is founded on certain principles, and a portion of that population believes it in one way and another portion believes it in another way. Those sides don't look like they're getting along, and it's just come to a boiling point, and I think this has been going on for a long time. It's just the Trump presidency has just been the catalyst for it. Yeah, I definitely agree with him on also the division... Oh, the division? You're also concerned about the division in the country? It seems like our only way of dealing with things is finger-pointing and just saying that this specific group of people are problems, and it's on both sides. And it's not getting anywhere. I agree with plenty of liberal ideas, but there are plenty of more conservative ideas that I find more reasonable and I find more attractive. For instance, if I say I'm very pro Second Amendment, then somebody will go, oh, so then you're like a right-wing gun nut, and I'm like, well, hold up, no. I'm very much in favor of having more open borders, of people being able to come into this country and work, legally, obviously. So they go, oh, well, then you're like some kind of libertarian, so you're never just a person. People aren't seeing you for who you are, and that's like a concern, to be seen. So, okay Yeah. That's a really good point you're making. This is what I don't like. What's wrong with being a conservative? What's wrong with being a right-wing? What is wrong with that? But it's okay for people to be accepted as being liberal, as being a Democrat, as being left. See, this is what I think. See, I could tell in your body language and your voice that you had to defend yourself. Oh, no, no, I'm not right, and see, that is wrong. And so what if you are right? Who cares? You know what? At the end, who cares? I hope that we, as a society and as a movement, we can still keep speaking out against the things he's doing against our communities and the people that are getting hurt from his actions, from the things he's saying, and from the people motivated by his agenda and by his rhetoric. So are you saying there's really deeper problems besides Trump? There's like real deeper issues and problems - that need to be addressed. - Exactly. Much of my impression of our opposition, or however we would call it, has been YouTube videos of people throwing, yelling out propaganda, one-liners, and stuff like that. It's not often that I've seen someone speak out to a length like he just did, so that was pretty good. I think my fundamental concern with right now, with the state of the country with where it is, is that there isn't this type of dialogue happening, is that we are entering into a society where people are afraid to speak out. I think that if people are siloed, and people only talk to people whom they agree with and whom they already have that same sort of thought process with, then we'll never have improvement to make this country what it really could be. I think what concerns me the most about our country is that I feel that a large portion of the population is making their decisions based on fear, and I feel that that's motivating people's politics, and I don't think it's the strongest, healthiest, or most peace-conducive place to come from. At this point, to kinda end the conversation, how was the empathic listening, having the person listen to you before you spoke? Did that feel satisfactory at all? Was that helpful in terms of feeling like you were heard? Yeah, I feel that Spencer is a good listener, even though we totally have different views on this. I'm pretty sure we'll never see eye to eye on this stuff, but I still got to appreciate his ability and willingness to sit and listen to me and let me listen to him. It was something I found, when we set up at Berkeley too, is going out and offering to do not just listening but feeling that warmth, that human connection, really calms people down. And I hear a lot, people say, empathy is for your personal relationships, your family, your friend, but politics is really about greed and selfishness, and it doesn't really fit in there, so don't even bother. But I think the functioning part of the democracy that's working right now is the empathic part. People do talk to each other, or it starts with empathy as the gateway, and then once you understand the needs that people have, the pain that they have, the alienation, then you can start using logic and reason and find connection, and from that connection, they find solutions to their problems. Johan Galtung, he says peace is resolving conflict with empathy, creativity, and nonviolence, and it's a never-ending task. It's like it never ends. It's like we're always having to do it, so it's not like we're gonna solve the problem of this division. It's an ongoing problem-solving that we need to do. In 2016, more than 250 million people were eligible to vote, and only 55% voted. Democracy will die without participation and an open dialogue. Join the conversation now before it's too late.
