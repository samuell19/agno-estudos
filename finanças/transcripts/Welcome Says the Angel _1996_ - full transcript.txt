Anna, just explain to me, what do you want, eh? - Just promise you're not gonna leave me. - How can I do that? - Just promise. Just promise! - Look, I've gotta decide for me self. - Can't you promise? - Look, you know that. Listen, when I was 16, I sent a letter to me mum, saying that my father was dead. I even made it look as if it came from America. I was just trying to get her to stop waiting for him. But she, she wouldn't believe it. She thought it was all a conspiracy, that he was like being held prisoner somewhere. Her mind was going though. She was really sick. Anyway, about six months later, I actually got a letter saying that he was dead, and you know, I couldn't tell her. - You're gonna leave, ain't you? - I don't know. - See those, take 'em. - Anna. - Go. - Anna, look. - Just go, see ya, bye. - Look, I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. - Don't say anything, just go. (door opens and closes) (traffic and commotion buzzes) (engaging jazz music) I've been out and around town to sell a few things. I sold a few today. - Wow, those are real nice. These are real nice. How much can you sell these for? - Well, about 10 bucks. - That one's a bit special. - This is really pretty. How much did you say? - 10 dollars. - 10 bucks? - Wow, it's cool. - You can have it. - Really? - Yeah. - Thanks. - You know that girl? The girt that sitting next to me at the bar? The girl, Anna? - Yeah. - I mean what about her? I mean, I'm really worried? I think she's addicted to heroin. - Really? What makes you think that, man? - These couple of guys, they were cool, at least the time when I worked. Do you know of 'em sort of like personally, intimately? - What are you getting at, man? - Well, can they ever get off I mean? - I got other things on my fucking mind. - Yeah, well, I'll work it out, Charlie. - Yeah, we'll see, Joshua. (door knocks) (bottle clanks) - You hungry? - No, just fucking frustrated. - All right, let's see what I got. (plates clank) Californian wine, bananas, some crystals, bread. You know, you look a little pale. - I'm always pale, Joshua. (plates clatter and bags rustle) - You're missing out on your feast, you know? I went to that bar. I saw our friend, Charlie. - What do you mean you saw him, what did you tell him? - I didn't tell him anything, we just talked. - You think you're just walking out of here? - Not while I'm eating. - I'm not on drugs, Joshua. - What are you on about? - You're all the same, fucking studs, pigs, you're all the same. - Why are you being a bitch? - Because. - Hey, put that down okay? Put that down it might be loaded. Come on, come on. (banging) Jesus Christ. Anna, put it down. Jesus, what are you doing, what are you doing? - What time is it? - I don't know, around seven o'clock. - Seven, seven o'clock. Dinner's ready. Come on Anna, everybody's waiting for you. I remember when mother used to call me and I'd come on down, and she'd bring in the food while my Father and Johnny, my brother didn't sit at the table, and I'd sit in front of 'em, and talk to my mother. Well, my dad and my brother, they'd just be sitting, waiting, waiting, doing nothing but watch TV. My mother used to complain about them all the time. She'd cook the nicest meals too. But, I think she's upset now. She won't even talk to me anymore. Joshua? - [Joshua] Yeah. - Why did you come back? - [Joshua] Needed somewhere to stay. - Oh you liar. Do you think he could ever love someone like me? - Someone as crazy as you? - What did you say? - A Bernadette. - You better watch your mouth. (light banging) (voices murmur from outside) - Oh, great. Joshua. Joshua! Joshua! Joshua! Damn him. (engaging jazz music) (bar commotion murmurs) - So I kinda like made up a story to tell the guy she was with. What's happened to you? You look like a total wreck. - What's happening to you. Are you sick or something? - Charlie, I need to talk to you. - [Charlie] About what? - Can you get somebody off this stuff? - Get somebody off of what? - Bloody fucking heroin. I wanna get her off of it. - Good luck, Superman. That's gonna be a tough one. - Yeah, I know. - Who the fuck are you man, have you ever tried it? You don't know nothing about it, man. - [Joshua] If somebody would explain it to me I think I might understand it. - Look, take it this way, man. You can't get somebody to leave the ways they wanna be. That's the way it is. (engaging dramatic music) - Ow, ow, stop it. What's the matter with you, are you crazy? - Who the fuck do you think you are? Jesus Christ, the fucking Savior? Joshua, what did you with my stash? - I threw it away. - Oh you did, huh? Well guess I want it and it was mine. You can't do this, Joshua. You can't stop a junkie from doing from doing what he does because it's not a joke. - I do it for myself. - Joshua, you can't help me. Don't you get it? You can't help me. I wanna do what I'm doing, it's my life. - [Joshua] I'm going to be right here with you, Anna. - I'm sick Joshua, I feel like shit, like shit, like shit, like shit. (vomits and retches) (water rinses) - Tell me a story, Joshua. - A story? - Yeah. - And what about? - I don't know, anything, just a story. Talk to me. - All right, yeah, okay. There was this guy. He lived in this little old town, just outside Liverpool. It was full of closed-down factories, and every morning he'd get up and go to work in this fish and chip joint. He'd start at seven o'clock, maybe cleaning all the grease from the ovens. And then at 12 o'clock when the shop would open, he'd start frying the fish and watching the bubbles, and he'd see the grease build up, and build up, all over again. He never had time to smoke a cigarette or talk to anyone, and at night, when the shop would close, he'd go home to this tiny little Council flat, and he was so greasy and so smelly, that he could never find a girl that could stand him for more than five minutes. And he'd dream, oh he dreamed, that he could just walk out, and start all over again, living for himself. But every morning it was the same old thing. He'd just get up, and go to work, and wipe and the blade of all the grease. Until one day, while he was staring at the oil bubbling in the pans, he had this fucking explosion, and for the first time in this old chip shop's history, the ovens blew up. Well, that sound would never leave his memory. And then guess what? - [Anna] What? - That was the first time he realized it was time to get the fuck out and start living. (chains clank) Settle down. - I don't care and what are you going to do about it anyways? I'm sick of this chain! - Bitch, listen to me, I don't mean it all like that. - Let me go, go. - Get down, get down, love, for me? (intense pulsating music) - Jesus, get off me. - Can't you feel me? - Fuck me, then fuck me. (tense dramatic music) (Anna moans) (engaging jazz music) (Anna pants) Don't stop, don't stop. (playful jazz music) I'm so cold, I'm so cold. I'm too warm, I'm too hot. I'm too hot, too hot. No, no, no. No, no! No. (Anna pants) (engaging jazz music) - I'm getting rid of pain, yeah. It's getting better. ♪ Getting better ♪ ♪ All the time ♪ - Keep away from me, motherfucker. Just stay away. Who the fuck are you anyways? You tell me you are just a little shit from Liverpool, England with fucking screwball ideas and narrow, so narrow visions, oh, if you only had an idea of how narrow your little teeny, tiny fucking mind is and you're trying to tell me what to do? You can't even take care of your own self. You wanna take care of me? You haven't even got a place? I mean, I don't get it. Can't you see that all this is bullshit, all of this, whatever you've been doing It's a bunch of crap and how can anybody know what anybody else feels anyways? Can you? No, you're just an arrogant son of a bitch. You're a pig. I mean, Joshua - Mm-mm. - Can I have a puff? You're smoking that whole cigarette aren't you. Such a cheat, you know, you always cheat, you cheated the other time, that other time too, the first time, do you remember? - I'm cheating. - Oh bananas, aha, I don't feel like bananas. I don't wanna eat bananas right now, go away. Go away, leave it alone. I'm still hurting, you know? - No, no, oh, no, no. - Back is, yes my back is. (coughs) Drink some. Now, I gotta pee. No. - You gotta keep yourself hydrated. It's really gross though. It tastes like cranberry juice. - I love it. - That's not funny. I mean I have to drink all this shit. I don't even like alcohol. - Feel better, bird? - No. - Okay, ow. The ash just burned me. Kiss it, you have to kiss it. - Why? - You have to kiss it. Yeah, that's right. I'm gonna go, Joshua, let me, I have to lie down somewhere. I don't feel all that good. Watch, you're gonna smoosh the banana. Did we put the ashes in here? Oh that's great, that's just wonderful. - Both of us knew. - You wanna natural and that's real good. Delicatessen, you should try this, natural and banana. It's my recipe. (laughs) Is it good or what? Okay, no, no, no, no, no. I'm serious I wanna go back to bed. Let me go. What did you do with this chain anyways? - I'm not gonna let you go. - My hand cramps. Can't you take them off me? - No. - Can't you take 'em off me now. Please? - No. - Can't you open them up and let me go there. Look, I'm all bruised and so sore. Now, it's really hurting.
