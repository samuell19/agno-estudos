[TELEPHONE RINGING] [RINGING] HELLO? [DISTORTED CRACKLING] IS ANYONE THERE? [EERIE DISTORTED CRACKLING CONTINUES] [ROARS]: LEAVE ME ALONE! [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] [THUDDING] [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] ABSOLUTELY! THE SQUAB IS ONE OF MY SIGNATURE DISHES. YES, I CAN DO THE GREEN TEA SOUFFLE, AS WELL. PERFECT. I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING, MRS. NYBERG, AND THANK YOU FOR THINKING OF ME. â™ª I LOVE IT! THAT'S THREE DINNER PARTIES THIS MONTH. NO, I LOVE IT. LET ME KNOW WHEN I CAN QUIT MY JOB. I'VE ALREADY GOT OUR FLORIDA RETIREMENT VILLA PICKED OUT. CLOTHING OPTIONAL. UGH. LET ME KNOW WHEN I CAN THROW UP. EW! ME TOO. MORNIN', DYLAN. HOW ARE YOU TODAY, DYLAN? I'M DOING FINE. THANKS, DAD. HOW YOU DOIN'? HEY, AREN'T YOU LATE FOR CLASS, PAL? I'LL GET THERE. TODAY'S THE BIG DAY, RIGHT? [INHALES SHARPLY]: WE THINK SO. APPOINTMENT'S AT 10. MY LAUNDRY DONE? ON THE STEP. COOL. WELL, I HOPE YOU TWO FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. IT'S STILL NOT TOO LATE TO GET A DOG. [CHUCKLES LIGHTLY] SO... THAT WENT WELL. I'LL TALK TO HIM. FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON. OH, I KNOW WHAT IT IS. IT'S ME, EVIL STEPMOTHER. WELL, NO ONE SAID THIS WAS GONNA BE EASY, EVEN WITH DYLAN LIVING AWAY AT COLLEGE. BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. I'VE TOLD HIM MANY TIMES, EITHER HE LOVES YOU AS MUCH AS I DO, OR, THAT'S IT, HE'S OUT OF THE WILL. THAT'S WHY I MARRIED YOU. EXCELLENT PARENTING SKILLS. GOOD. WELL, I'M GLAD IT WAS-- I KNEW THERE WAS A REASON I GOT SO LUCKY. [BOTH CHUCKLING] WOW, I DIDN'T THINK I'D BE SO NERVOUS. YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE. THIS IS GOOD, RIGHT? THIS MEETING THEY ASKED FOR. I THINK IT'S BETTER THAN GOOD. YOU DON'T? NO, NO, I DO. IT'S JUST ALL THE FORUMS SAY IT CAN TAKE UP TO 18 MONTHS TO GET YOUR REFERRAL THROUGH, SO... MAYBE THEY LIKED US. BUMPED US UP THE LIST. I KNOW THEY LIKED ME. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? WELL... YOU KNOW HOW YOU ARE, AND THEY DID SAY PERSONALITY-- -OH, PERSONALITY? -...WAS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR. OH! YOU THINK I HAVE A HORRIBLE PERSONALITY? NO, NO. I'M SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE ONE! HEY, HEY. COOL IT. PEOPLE ARE LOOKING. I DON'T CARE. LET THEM. YOU GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. YOU'RE GOING TO BE A GREAT MOM. [PHONE RINGING] HELLO. THIS IS LYDIA. [WOMAN HISSES]: SHE'S MINE. MINE! MINE. [LINE CLICKS, DIAL TONE BUZZES] [PHONE RINGS] [GASPING] I'M SORRY, KIM. I-I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE. NO WORRIES. LOVE YOUR NECKLACE. THANK YOU. MORNING. [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] SO... BOY OR GIRL? WE'RE EXCITED TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. MRS. MAXWELL, ON YOUR ADOPTION APPLICATION, YOU NOTED THAT YOU TAKE CITALOPRAM FOR DEPRESSION. IS THAT CORRECT? THAT'S RIGHT. MY DOCTOR PRESCRIBED IT. AND YOU'VE BEEN TAKING IT FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR NOW? [JOANNA]: YES. -REGULARLY? -REGULARLY, YES. [BEN]: KIM, WHAT'S THIS ABOUT? WE WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION WE WERE JUST GONNA COME HERE AND YOU WERE GOING TO SHOW US A PICTURE OF OUR NEW BABY. WELL, TO BE PERFECTLY, UH... BLUNT... WE HAVE A PROBLEM. THE USE OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS IS FROWNED UPON BY MANY OF THE COUNTRIES WITH WHOM WE HAVE ADOPTION AGREEMENTS. THAT SEEMS RATHER NARROW-MINDED. YEAH, I WOULD THINK ANYTHING THAT WOULD HELP A PROSPECTIVE PARENT COPE WOULD BE SEEN AS A GOOD THING. I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, THEY DON'T VIEW IT THIS WAY. THE MEDICATION GAVE HER HER LIFE BACK. I HAVE A CHEMICAL DEFICIENCY, THAT'S ALL. YOU KNOW, IF I HAD A BROKEN ARM AND DIDN'T TREAT IT, YOU WOULD THINK I WAS RIDICULOUS. HOW IS THIS ANY DIFFERENT? IT'S NOT WRONG TO ASK FOR HELP. LOOK, I REALIZE THAT THEIR THINKING IS FLAWED, BUT, BECAUSE YOU DISCLOSED IT IN YOUR MEDICAL HISTORY, THE DAMAGE IS DONE. ARE YOU SAYING OUR APPLICATION HAS BEEN FLAT-OUT REJECTED? I'M AFRAID SO. BUT LET'S NOT FORGET THERE ARE OPTIONS AVAILABLE, UM, SUCH AS DOMESTIC ADOPTION. [JOANNA]: THAT'S NOT FOR US. WE HAVE FRIENDS WHO'VE BEEN ON THE WAITING LIST FOR OVER THREE YEARS. THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS, WE COULD EASILY BE ON FOR TWICE THAT LONG. WHAT IF WE WERE TO REFILE WITHOUT MENTIONING THE ANTI-DEPRESSANTS? AT THIS POINT, YOU HAVE TO DISCLOSE THAT, OR IT'S FRAUD. WHAT ABOUT SURROGACY? WE'VE TRIED. WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO ADOPTING A TEEN? OUR FOSTER SYSTEM, IT JUST HAS SO MANY INCREDIBLE YOUNG LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AVAILABLE FOR PERMANENT ADOPTION. BEN, I WANT TO GO HOME. [BEN, QUIETLY]: YEAH. THIS ISN'T RIGHT. YOU SHOULD WARN PEOPLE. [EXHALES HEAVILY] I'M REALLY SORRY. SO ARE WE. [SIGHS WEARILY] WELL, THAT SUCKED. THEY SEEM LIKE SUCH GOOD PEOPLE, TOO. IT'S... IT'S JUST NOT FAIR. IT NEVER IS. [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] [SNIFFLING] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] I'M SORRY. IS SOMEONE IN THERE? BE RIGHT OUT. HEY, GRETCHEN. HOW'S MY MOM DOING? OH, IT'S BEEN ONE OF THOSE DAYS, BUT SHE'LL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU. SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE A BAD COSMIC JOKE. THE PARENT WHO CARED ABOUT ME IS GONE, AND THE ONE WHO'S LEFT BEHIND NEEDS CONSTANT CARE. I KNOW YOU LOVED YOUR FATHER VERY MUCH, AND WE MISS SEEING HIM AROUND HERE, TOO. JUST DO YOUR BEST. LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO. HI, MOM. WHY HAS MICHAEL STOPPED VISITING ME? HAS HE FOUND SOMEONE ELSE? NO. MOM... DAD PASSED AWAY LAST WINTER. REMEMBER? IT WAS SNOWING AT THE FUNERAL. THE WIND WAS BLOWING? THE WIND? OHH... IT WAS COLD. BLUSTERY. THAT'S RIGHT. NOT A GOOD DAY FOR A FUNERAL. NO. BUT I LIKED THAT POTATO SALAD. AND THE HAM. HAVE YOUR COUSIN, ANNETTE, BRING ME SOME MORE. YOU KNOW... I COULD COOK FOR YOU. MY CATERING COMPANY HAS REALLY TAKEN OFF. ANNETTE'S POTATO SALAD IS THE BEST. TELL HER TO MAKE A LOT OF IT. OKAY. I'LL DO THAT. [UNCERTAIN]: MICHAEL'S GONE? HE IS, MOM... DAD'S DEAD AND GONE. MY HUSBAND IS DEAD, TOO. OH, DOLORES. I KNOW. I'M SORRY. DON'T BE. HE COMES TO VISIT ME EVERY NIGHT, JUST LIKE HE SAID HE WOULD. LARRY IS A GOOD MAN. [SCOFFS WITH DISGUST] THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A GOOD MAN. THEY'RE ALL BOOZERS AND SKIRT-CHASERS, AND MY HUSBAND WAS THE WORST OF THEM ALL! MOM, DON'T SAY THAT. YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE. DAD LOVED YOU. LARRY AND I PLAY BINGO TOGETHER. HE LETS ME WIN. [GIGGLES] [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] HER ALZHEIMER'S IS GETTING WORSE. WELL, THAT'S NOT UNUSUAL. OFTEN, THE DEATH OF A SPOUSE CAN ACCELERATE DEMENTIA. IT HAPPENED TO MY MOTHER. WELL, I'M NOT SURE DOLORES IS DOING MUCH BETTER. SHE SAYS HER DEAD HUSBAND COMES TO VISIT HER. THEY PLAY BINGO. WELL, OF COURSE, HE DOES. IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME A SPIRIT'S STOPPED BY TO DEAL WITH UNFINISHED BUSINESS. YOU SHOULD SEE YOUR FACE. [LAUGHS]: NICE ONE. YOU HAD ME GOIN'. I COULD TELL. THE TRUTH IS, YOU WORK HEREONG ENOUGH, YOU SEE JUST HOW STRONG THE EARTHLY BONDS ARE BETWEEN PEOPLE. HUSBANDS AND WIVES, FATHERS AND SONS, MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS... MAYBE THESE BONDS ARE HARDER TO BREAK THAN WE THINK. NAH. I THINK IT'S JUST WISHFUL THINKING. [CHUCKLING]: BYE. [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] I FEEL LIKE IT'S MY FAULT. MAYBE I SHOULD'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH. DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP, HONEY. IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE. YEAH, BUT IF I J-- "BUT" NOTHING. I'M NOT GOING TO LET THEM MAKE ME FEEL BAD ABOUT DOING WHAT WAS RIGHT FOR ME AT THE TIME. [DOORBELL CHIMES] MR. MAXWELL? HI. MY NAME IS LYDIA NEWMAN. I'M FROM THE ST. BARLOW ADOPTION AGENCY, AND I THINK I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS FOR YOU. THANK YOU. THIS WILL STRIKE YOU AS UNORTHODOX, BUT I OVERHEARD YOUR CONVERSATION WITH KIM AT THE AGENCY AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I UNDERSTAND YOUR FRUSTRATION. THANK YOU, MS. NEWMAN. MY OWN MOTHER WAS ON ANTI-DEPRESSANTS FOR YEARS. BACK THEN, IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT. I CAN'T BEGIN TO IMAGINE THE NUMBER OF GREAT MOMS AND DADS WHO'VE BEEN TURNED AWAY BY THIS RIDICULOUS NOTION THAT THEY'RE TOO DAMAGED TO LOVE A CHILD. VERY TRUE. WHICH BRINGS ME TO WHY I'M HERE. I'VE COME ACROSS A UNIQUE SITUATION. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PLACE A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL. HER MOTHER IS IN PRISON ON A THREE-STRIKE FELONY CONVICTION-- AND SHE'S AGREED TO TURN THE CHILD OVER TO THE STATE FOR PERMANENT ADOPTION. OHH... THERE MUST BE A WAITING LIST? NOT IF YOU CAN CIRCUMVENT IT. WHICH IS WHY... I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO YOUR NEW DAUGHTER. WHOA. HOLD ON. UH... I REALLY, REALLY APPRECIATE YOU THINKING ABOUT US FIRST, BUT I GOT TO ASK YOU... AND I HOPE YOU DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY... ISN'T THIS ILLEGAL? WELL, I SUPPOSE SOMEBODY COULD MAKE THAT ARGUMENT, BUT LET ME ASSURE YOU, IN ALL MY YEARS AS A SOCIAL WORKER, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY CHALLENGE A PLACEMENT REQUEST. NO, RIGHT. HOWEVER, IF WE DID DECIDE TO GO DOWN THIS ROAD, THERE IS ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY THAT, AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE, WE COULD END UP IN A LEGAL BATTLE. I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO BE PARENTS. WE DO! BUT I THINK MY HUSBAND'S QUESTIONS ARE GOOD ONES. I MEAN, THE LAST THING WE'D WANT TO HAPPEN IS TO BRING THIS LITTLE GIRL INTO OUR HOME, ONLY TO LOSE HER. MAYBE I WAS WRONG ABOUT THE TWO OF YOU. MOST COUPLES WOULD LEAP AT A DOMESTIC ADOPTION OPPORTUNITY WITH NO BIRTH MOTHER IN THE WAY. MS. NEWMAN, WAIT. NO, I... I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS A LONG TIME, AND ALTHOUGH MOST OF YOU WON'T ADMIT IT, NONE OF YOU WANT TO SHARE YOUR CHILD'S LOVE WITH ANYONE. WHAT I'M OFFERING YOU IS A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME OCCURRENCE. [BEN]: WE DON'T DISAGREE. BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO SET OURSELVES UP FOR DISASTER. ISN'T THERE SOME WAY WE CAN DO THIS BY THE BOOK? YOU KNOW, I'M NOT HERE TO DEBATE THE LEGAL PARAMETERS OF "BY THE BOOK," MR. MAXWELL, EXCEPT TO SAY THAT ALL THE PROPER PAPERWORK WOULD BE IN PLACE. YOU KNOW... BEING A PARENT, IT REQUIRES PERSONAL SACRIFICE, AND, IF YOU DON'T THINK THAT YOU WERE WRONGED BY THE SYSTEM, I'M SURE I CAN FIND SOMEBODY WHO WAS. NO, WAIT. MAYBE WE'RE BEING TOO CAUTIOUS. IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE USE A FEW MINUTES TO DISCUSS THIS... IN PRIVATE. WHY? HIS MIND'S ALREADY MADE UP. THAT'S NOT TRUE. PLEASE. JUST A MINUTE. FINE. "WHEN ONE DOOR CLOSES, ANOTHER ONE OPENS." ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU ALWAYS SAY? YEAH, BUT THIS IS VERY DICEY. I MEAN, I CAN'T EVEN COMPREHEND ALL THE WAYS THIS COULD TURN OUT BADLY. I KNOW, BUT I WANT TO MOVE FORWARD ANYWAY. WHY? I MEAN, YOU'VE NEVER BEEN ONE TO THROW CAUTION TO THE WIND BEFORE. LOOK AT THIS LITTLE GIRL, BEN. SHE NEEDS US! JOANNA, THAT'S NOT FAIR. I KNOW IT'S NOT, BUT IT'S THE WAY I FEEL, AND I CAN'T GIVE YOU A BETTER, MORE CONCRETE ANSWER, SO I'M ASKING YOU TO TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH WITH ME. WE NEED TO GET THIS LITTLE GIRL INTO A LOVING HOME, EVEN IF IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY. WHAT DO YOU SAY? WE'D LOVE TO ADOPT PIPER. [LYDIA, LAUGHING]: OH! OH... THAT'S WONDERFUL NEWS. I'LL BE IN TOUCH SOON TO FINALIZE EVERYTHING. I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU. I ALWAYS SAY, "EVERY WOMAN DESERVES TO BE A MOM." [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] WHAT TIME IS IT? FIVE MINUTES LATER THAN THE LAST TIME YOU ASKED ME. WHAT IF LYDIA DOESN'T SHOW UP? UH, THEN WE STEER CLEAR OF GOING TO JAIL. TAKE THAT BACK. WHAT'S HAPPENED IS A BLESSING. [DOORBELL CHIMES] WE'RE HERE! [CHUCKLES]: COME ON. IT'S OKAY. COME ON. HI. HONEY, WE'RE SO GLAD TO FINALLY MEET YOU. [BEN]: HEY, PIPER. THIS IS FOR YOU. HERE YOU GO, PIPER. I MADE THIS FOR YOU. YOU MADE THIS! [GASPS]: OH, MY GOODNESS. OHH! IT'S BEAUTIFUL, AND I LOVE IT. YOU'RE A GREAT ARTIST. THANK YOU. CAN I SEE IT? OHH. [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] [CHUCKLES]: OH! TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER, OKAY? [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] NOTHING COULD FEEL MORE RIGHT. DO YOU WANT TO GO BACK INSIDE? HOW COME, SWEETIE? WELL, WHAT IF IT'S NOT REAL? IT'S REAL, SWEETHEART. DO YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR ROOM? IS IT MY "FOREVER" ROOM? IT CERTAINLY IS. WE'RE FAMILY NOW... AND WE'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU. EVER. EVEN WHEN MY MOMMY COMES? WELL... YOU'RE A VERY LUCKY LITTLE GIRL, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWO MOMMIES NOW. AND, UM... MAYBE WE COULD ALL LIVE HERE TOGETHER. I WOULD LIKE THAT! OKAY. WELL, THEN LET'S GO! I'LL RACE YOU. -OKAY. -OKAY! HEY, AND WHAT ABOUT THE, UH...? I'M SENSING A TREND HERE. [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] HONEY, SHUT OFF THE WATERWORKS. NO TEARS. I CAN'T HELP IT. SHE'S JUST TOO PRECIOUS. YOU'RE GOING TO FREAK HER OUT. [LAUGHS] HEY, PIPER? LOOK AT THIS. I'M GOING TO PUT YOUR BEAUTIFUL DRAWING RIGHT HERE... ...WHERE WE CAN ALL LOOK AT IT EVERY DAY. DO YOU LIKE THAT? YEAH. [GIGGLING] OH! PIPER, WE'RE SO GLAD YOU'RE FINALLY HERE. I THINK SHE LIKES US. [LAUGHING] [SCRATCHING] [BELL DINGS] [JOANNA SIGHS] WHERE'S MINE? [PLAYFULLY THUMPS COUNTER] WHERE IS MY COOKIE? I... WANT... MY... COOKIE! WHERE... IS IT? IS IT... HERE? WHERE... IS IT? OH! I KNOW WHERE MY COOKIE IS! IT'S RIGHT... HERE! [SQUEALS] THERE'S MY COOKIE! THERE'S MY COOKIE! ARE YOU MY COOKIE? ARE YOU MY DELICIOUS LITTLE COOKIE OF A GIRL? ANSWER ME. YOU BETTER ANSWER ME, OR I'M GOING TO EAT YOU ALL UP. ARE YOU MY SCRUMPTIOUS LITTLE DAUGHTER? YES! AND AM I THE BEST COOKIE-LOVER YOU KNOW? YES! AND AM I YOUR FAVORITE MOMMY OF ALL TIME? PIPER, THAT-- I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T MEAN THAT. THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT. PIPER! [PIPER RACES AWAY] WOW... DAD WAS RIGHT. YOU DO HAVE A WAY WITH KIDS. [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] [PEOPLE CHATTING, KIDS PLAYING] [WENDY]: SO, HOW'S SHE TRANSITIONING? PRETTY GOOD, I GUESS. WE'VE HAD OUR UPS AND DOWNS, BUT, OTHERWISE, PIPER'S COMING ALONG JUST FINE. SHE HASN'T CALLED ME "MOMMY" JUST YET... BELIEVE ME, THERE'LL BE DAYS YOU WISH SHE NEVER KNEW THE WORD. NOT ME. AH, THE GLOWING OPTIMISM OF A NEW MOTHER. YOU HAVE TO LOVE IT. [CHUCKLES] SWINGS! [PIPER, SOFTLY]: â™ª GOOSEY, GOOSEY GANDER â™ª WHITHER SHALL I WANDER â™ª UPSTAIRS AND DOWNSTAIRS â™ª AND IN MY LADY'S CHAMBER â™ª THERE I MET AN OLD MAN â™ª AND HE WOULD NOT SAY HIS PRAYERS â™ª â™ª I TOOK HIM BY THE LEFT LEG â™ª â™ª AND THREW HIM DOWN THE STAIRS â™ªâ™ª WOW. [UNEASY CHUCKLE] THAT'S AN OLDIE, BUT A GOODIE. WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT ONE? IN MY HEAD. CAN I HAVE A SNACK NOW? YES. I'VE GOT YOUR SNACK RIGHT HERE. AND A HUG! OH, PEANUT. YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE HUGS YOU WANT! MM! MOMMY... MOMMY? [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] WAIT HERE A SECOND, SWEETHEART. [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] EXCUSE ME? [CAR HORN BLARING] [TIRES SQUEALING] [SCREAMS]: PIPER! COME HERE! HONEY, ARE YOU OKAY? SHE JUST DARTED OUT IN FRONT OF THE CAR. I COULD'VE KILLED HER. I ONLY TURNED AWAY FOR ONE SECOND. WELL, THAT'S ALL IT TAKES WITH KIDS. EVEN I KNOW THAT. I'VE GOT HER NOW. THANK YOU. HONEY, ARE YOU OKAY? WHY WOULD YOU JUST DART IN FRONT OF TRAFFIC LIKE THAT? BUT MOMMY TOLD ME TO. MOMMY WOULD NEVER DO SUCH A THING. COME ON. [SUV ENGINE STARTS] [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] JUST GLAD EVERYONE'S ALL RIGHT. I WISH I'D BEEN THERE. TELL ME ABOUT IT. YOU THINK PIPER'S OKAY? SHE'S FINE. THE GOOD NEWS IS, SHE WASN'T HIT. NO, NO, I MEAN OKAY WITH THE TRANSITION TO HER NEW FAMILY AND ALL. WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WELL, WHY WOULD SHE CALL THIS WOMAN IN THE PARK HER "MOM"? THINK WE SHOULD HAVE HER EVALUATED? WHAT? I'M JUST SAYING. THAT YOU THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH OUR DAUGHTER? THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT. WELL, THEN TELL ME. WHAT DID YOU MEAN? HONEY, CALM DOWN. ALL I'M SAYING IS, I HOPE THAT... WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE SHOULD. YOU KNOW, PIPER'S LIFE HAS BEEN DIFFICULT ENOUGH ALREADY. WE'RE DOING FINE. ALL THE BOOKS SAY THE SAME THING-- ADOPTED CHILDREN HAVE BONDING ISSUES. A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THEY'LL OFTEN TURN TO ANY ADULT AS THEIR PARENT. THAT'S ALL THIS IS. REALLY? I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT. POOR LITTLE SQUIRT. WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE? [ROARS] I'M GOING TO GET YOU! [SQUEALING AND LAUGHING] KEEP IT DOWN, DYLAN! WHAT? SHE LIKES IT. WELL, I DON'T. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT SAFE TO ACT ALL CRAZY AROUND THE POOL. WHAT IF SHE FELL IN? SHE CAN'T SWIM. SHE'S NOT GONNA FALL IN. DON'T ARGUE WITH ME! I DON'T LIKE THE WAY YOU'RE PLAYING. PLEASE STOP. IT'S OKAY. I LIKE IT. IT'S REALLY FUN. HONEY, HE COULD HURT YOU. YOU SEEM TO FORGET SHE'S ONLY SIX YEARS OLD. I SEE. ANYTHING ELSE? [WATER DRIPPING] NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT, I DON'T LIKE YOUR USE OF BAD LANGUAGE IN FRONT OF HER, EITHER, OR THE FACT THAT YOU NEVER SEEM TO CARE WHETHER YOU'RE WATCHING INAPPROPRIATE TELEVISION. I MEAN, YOU DO KNOW BETTER, AM I RIGHT? MAYBE I SHOULD'VE STAYED IN MY DORM AND LEFT YOU AT PEACE WITH YOUR "NEW" FAMILY. WOULD THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY? [SIGHS]: DYLAN, LOOK-- YOU'RE SUCH A BITCH. I HEARD THAT. HEY! WOULD YOU TALK TO HER? SHE SEEMS TO THINK THAT EVERYTHING I DO IS BAD FOR PIPER. I'M NOT A CHILD. THEN STOP ACTING LIKE ONE. -THERE WE GO! -HEY. CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN. ME? WHAT ABOUT HER? OR DOES THIS NEW FAMILY SUPERCEDE YOUR OTHER? YOU'RE WAY OUT OF LINE, DYLAN. NO, I'M NOT! SHE FINALLY GOT A KID OUTTA YOU, NOW IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THE REST OF US CAN GO TO HELL. APOLOGIZE TO JOANNA! RIGHT NOW! I'M SORRY YOU'RE A BITCH. AND I'M SORRY YOU'RE TOO BLINDED BY HER TO SEE HOW YOU'VE CHANGED. DYLAN! GET BACK HERE! [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] DYLAN. DYLAN, STOP. WHY? I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE? I'M GOING BACK TO SCHOOL, WHERE I BELONG. STOP BEING RIDICULOUS. OH, IS THAT WHAT I AM NOW? I THOUGHT I WAS JUST A BAD INFLUENCE. CAN WE ALL JUST COOL DOWN HERE FOR A MINUTE? THERE'S NO REASON YOU HAVE TO LEAVE. THIS IS YOUR FAMILY. NO, THIS IS YOUR FAMILY. OUR FAMILY CRASHED AND BURNED A LONG TIME AGO. [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] HEY. YOU OKAY? NO. MY STEPSON CALLED ME A "BITCH," AND SUGGESTED THAT I COERCED YOU INTO GIVING ME A CHILD. YEP. I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM THIS UPSET BEFORE. YEAH. HE PRETTY MUCH SAID IT ALL. CLEARLY, HE RESENTS PIPER. REALLY? I DON'T KNOW. HE'S 19. YEAH, I'M NOT SURE IT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH AGE, YOU KNOW. IF HE'S GOT SOME ISSUE WITH YOU OR ME, I MEAN, IT STILL WOULD HURT. LOOK AT ME AND MY MOM. WE'VE NEVER WORKED ANYTHING OUT. YEAH, I GUESS WE SHOULD CUT HIM A BREAK THIS TIME. SO, WHEN DYLAN'S UPSET, WE ALL NEED TO CHANGE, BUT PIPER IS A CHILD WHO NEEDS EVALUATION? HONEY, THAT'S NOT TRUE. TO BE HONEST, I HEARD A BIT OF WHAT SET DYLAN OFF, AND I'M NOT SURE HE'S ENTIRELY WRONG. I KNOW YOU'RE FRUSTRATED, BUT LIKE WE JUST SAID, DYLAN'S A TEENAGER. HE'S GONNA TREAT HER DIFFERENTLY. NOT LIKE... LIKE WHAT? [EXHALING] LIKE NEW CHINA. YOU CAN'T TAKE YOUR FRUSTRATIONS FROM YOUR DAY AT THE PARK OUT ON DYLAN. THAT'S NOT FAIR. OKAY. OKAY... EVIL STEPMOTHER IN CHECK. SWEETIE, ARE YOU OKAY? PIPER? [BEN]: I THINK SHE'S SLEEPWALKING. [WHISPERS]: OH... SHE PEED HER PANTS. [TELEPHONE RINGS] HERE, I'LL TAKE HER. COME HERE, HONEY. I GOT YOU, BIG GIRL. OH, WE'RE GONNA CLEAN YOU UP. LET'S GO. OH... [RINGING] HELLO? [EERIE DISTORTED CRACKLING] [BEEPS PHONE OFF] [PHONE RINGS AGAIN] [CURTLY]: WHO IS THIS? JOANNA, IT'S GRETCHEN. HI, GRETCHEN. I NEED TO LET YOU KNOW, YOUR MOTHER, SHE'S TAKEN A TURN FOR THE WORSE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEDATE HER. [GROANING AND FUMING] [ROARS]: I WANT MY DAUGHTER! WE CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. SHE'S JUST BECOME SO MUCH MORE DISORIENTED. HER COGNITIVE ABILITY HAS REALLY DETERIORATED. IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO? NOT REALLY. THOUGH, SOMETIMES, SEEING FAMILIAR FACES CAN TRIGGER THE MEMORY, KIND OF GET HER BACK ON TRACK. HEY... HI. I HEAR YOU WERE ASKING FOR ME. MOM? MOM, IT'S ME. JOANNA. [DARKLY]: JOANNA, YOU'RE LATE. I TOLD YOU TO BE HOME BY 5:00. WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT? YOU NEVER LISTEN TO ME. YOU'RE NEVER HOME ON TIME, YOU NEVER CLEAN UP YOUR ROOM. MOM, STOP. I'M YOUR DAUGHTER, THIS IS YOUR GRAND-DAUGHTER. I'M YOUR DAUGHTER. THIS IS YOUR FATHER'S FAULT. HIS GENES. HIS IRRESPONSIBILITY. I NEVER WANTED THIS. I NEVER WANTED A BABY IN THE FIRST PLACE! MOM! OKAY, HONEY, LET'S GO FIND SOME TOYS, OKAY? [WITH DARK DISGUST]: A MOTHER... A HOUSEWIFE? [BRACES SNAP TAUT] TIED DOWN LIKE A PIG TO SLAUGHTER. THIS IS YOUR FAULT, JOANNA. YOUR... FAULT. I HAD A LIFE! I NEVER WANTED YOU. MOM, STOP IT! STOP! [WHOOSHING] [DISORIENTED GRUNT] [PLEASANTLY SURPRISED]: HELLO, JOANNA. [SIGHS SHAKILY] WHERE'S PIPER? I THOUGHT YOU WERE BRINGING HER BY. GRETCHEN SAID SHE'D TAKE A PICTURE OF US TOGETHER. [GRETCHEN]: OH, DON'T TAKE IT TO HEART. I SEE IT ALL THE TIME. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING, AND, FOR GOD'S SAKE, THEY DON'T MEAN IT. I KNOW. I KNOW. DO YOU? ACTUALLY, I THINK SHE WAS BEING HONEST FOR THE FIRST TIME. [CONCERNED]: JOANNA. IT'S OKAY. YOU KNOW, MY MOTHER WAS ALWAYS VERY DISTANT, GROWING UP. IN FACT, I USED TO SAY, IT SEEMED SHE WAS IN A CONSTANT STATE OF WISHING SHE WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE. MAYBE I WASN'T WRONG. DON'T BE TOO HARD ON HER. I WISH MY DAD WAS HERE. HE'D KNOW WHAT TO DO. WELL, MAYBE HE'S... ON HIS WAY, AND YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IT. SOMETIMES, THE ONLY PEACE MY PATIENTS FIND COMES AFTER A VISIT... FROM THE OTHER SIDE. HERE, LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING. WHAT ARE THOSE? [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] NO ONE SAW THE GLOWING LIGHTS WHEN I TOOK THE PHOTO. AND? WELL, A SKEPTIC MIGHT SAY THAT IT'S JUST THE LIGHT REFRACTING IN THE LENS. BUT YOU THINK IT'S SOMETHING ELSE? WELL, I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND NUTTY, BUT WHEN YOU'VE WORKED HERE FOR AS LONG AS I HAVE... YOU BECOME WITNESS TO THINGS YOU JUST CAN'T EXPLAIN. I BELIEVE THAT, WHEN A PATIENT LOSES THEIR GRIP ON THIS WORLD, THEY GAIN ACCESS TO... ANOTHER PLACE... A SPIRITUAL PLANE. A PLACE... THAT WE'RE NOT EVEN AWARE OF. I GUESS I'M JUST NOT MUCH OF A BELIEVER IN THAT KIND OF STUFF. I JUST DON'T BUY IT. I GUESS I THINK WHAT'S DONE IS DONE, AND, WHEN IT ENDS, MAYBE IT'S FOR THE BEST. OKAY. TO EACH HIS OWN. [CHUCKLES] UM, WELL, I'LL MAKE SURE YOUR MOM GETS A COPY OF THIS PHOTO. YOU TOO, IF YOU WANT ONE. OH, THAT'S OKAY. I DON'T WANT ONE, BUT... BUT THANK YOU. [EXHALES WEARILY] GOODBYE, MOM. [QUIETLY STARTS SINGING]: â™ª GOOSEY, GOOSEY GANDER â™ª WHITHER SHALL I WANDER â™ª UPSTAIRS AND DOWNSTAIRS â™ª IN MY LADY'S CHAMBER â™ª THERE I MET AN OLD MAN â™ª WHO WOULD NOT SAY HIS PRAYERS â™ª â™ª SO I TOOK HIM BY HIS LEFT LEG â™ª â™ª AND THREW HIM DOWN THE STAIRS â™ªâ™ª [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] [GIGGLING AND LAUGHING] [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] [CHUCKLING] MUST'VE HURT TO HEAR HER SAY THAT. IT FELT LIKE A KNIFE IN MY STOMACH. WELL, THE TRUTH CAN HURT. ALTHOUGH, LATER ON, IT FELT DIFFERENT, AS IF HEARING THE TRUTH GAVE ME A WINDOW INTO HER SOUL, IF THAT MAKES SENSE. WELL, YOU JUST ADMITTED THAT SHE HAS A SOUL. THE TRIPPY THING IS, ALL THAT RESENTMENT THAT'S BEEN BUILDING UP OVER THE YEARS, SOME OF IT KIND OF WENT AWAY. THAT'S BECAUSE MAYBE YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND HER. BETTER THAN I EVER DID BEFORE, THAT'S FOR SURE. YOU KNOW WHAT? LET IT GO. JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE YOUR PARENTS DOESN'T MEAN THEY AREN'T WITHOUT THEIR OWN FLAWS. EASIER SAID THAN DONE. [TELEPHONE RINGING] [BEEPS PHONE ON] HELLO? IS MY DAD THERE? HI, DYLAN. UH, NO, HE'S NOT. TELL HIM TO CALL ME. OKAY. HEY, HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING AT SCH--? [CLICK, DIAL TONE BUZZES] [BEEP] OH! HE'S STILL NOT TALKING TO YOU, HUH? AFRAID NOT. [GASPS] [SHATTERING] [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] WHAT? WHAT, WHAT IS IT? [EXHALES] [CROW CAWING] UM... REMEMBER THAT WOMAN I TOLD YOU ABOUT? THE ONE FROM THE PARK? YEAH? I THINK I JUST SAW HER OUTSIDE. WHAT? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? DO YOU THINK MAYBE SHE FOLLOWED YOU HOME FROM THE PARK? I DON'T KNOW. [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] [PIPER]: MOMMY? [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] PIPER! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? MOMMY WAS HERE. SHE'S COMING TO TAKE ME HOME. [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] THE HOMELESS WOMAN. BEN, I SAW HER AGAIN. RIGHT OUTSIDE OUR HOUSE. CALL THE POLICE. I'M COMING HOME. I HAVE, I HAVE. THEY SAID THEY'D PATROL THE NEIGHBORHOOD. BUT THAT STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN PIPER'S BEHAVIOR. I'M TELLING YOU, SOMETHING IS WRONG. HONEY, LISTEN TO ME. MAYBE THIS IS BETTER HANDLED BY A PROFESSIONAL. LIKE I SAID BEFORE, LET ME MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR PIPER WITH A CHILD THERAPIST WHO SPECIALIZES IN ADOPTION CASES. NO, NO. I NEED MORE THAN SOME SHRINK'S THEORIES. PIPER DESERVES THE TRUTH, AND SO DO WE. OKAY. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO THE SOURCE. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. HOLD ON, JOANNA. JUST HOLD ON A SECOND. THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE. OH, I HAVE. NOBODY AT THE AGENCY KNOWS ABOUT THIS ADOPTION BUT LYDIA. YOU'RE OPENING UP A WHOLE OTHER CAN OF WORMS HERE. I DON'T CARE. I JUST WANT TO HELP MY LITTLE GIRL. [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] MAY I HELP YOU? UH, I WAS LOOKING FOR LYDIA NEWMAN. MRS. MAXWELL? WHERE'S LYDIA? SHE QUIT. WHY? ACTUALLY, WE DON'T KNOW. SHE JUST STOPPED COMING IN FOR WORK ONE DAY. [EXHALES] IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG? NO, NO. I, UH... JUST WANTED TO THANK HER. OH. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU KNEW LYDIA. UH, WELL, SHE HEARD THAT OUR ADOPTION PLANS FELL THROUGH, AND, UH, SENT US A LOVELY GIFT BASKET, AND I THOUGHT MAYBE I'D WRITE HER A THANK-YOU NOTE AND YOU COULD FORWARD IT TO HER. OF COURSE. [TELEPHONE RINGS] EXCUSE ME. YES, WE WILL NEED ABOUT TWO HOURS. [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] YES. [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] THANKS SO MUCH. MY PLEASURE. [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] I'VE BEEN WILLING TO DO WHATEVER IT IS YOU NEED, EXCEPT THIS. OH, COME ON, YOU'RE MY GUY. I NEED YOU TO TRUST ME ON THIS. LOOK, OUR DAUGHTER IS A BEAUTIFUL, INTELLIGENT, CARING LITTLE GIRL. SHE'S NOT DAMAGED. SHE DOESN'T THINK EVERY ADULT SHE SEES IS HER MOTHER. SHE THINKS ONE PARTICULAR WOMAN WHO IS STALKING US IS HER MOM, AND I NEED KNOW WHY. THEN YOU THINK SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS WOMAN YOU'VE SEEN? OUR DAUGHTER IS NOT A LIAR. NO. BUT... HER MOTHER'S IN PRISON. WHAT IF SHE'S NOT? WHAT IF SHE WAS NEVER IN PRISON? WHAT IF LYDIA IS LYING? THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO KNOW. ARE YOU WITH ME? CHECK THIS OUT. [BEN]: SOMETHING TELLS ME THIS ISN'T GOING TO END WELL. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] [CHIMES TINKLING] [BEN GASPING] OH, GOD. [BEN]: HELLO? HELLO? [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] WHOA. WHY DO THIS? SHE'S TOTALLY NUTS. [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] WHATEVER HER STATE OF MIND, SHE'S CERTAINLY AFRAID OF SOMETHING. [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] UH, JOANNA... WHY WOULD SHE BURN PIPER'S FILE? I DON'TW, BUT WHO'S THIS? YOU EVER HEARD OF THEM? NO. LYDIA HASN'T EVER MENTIONED EITHER OF THEM. [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] [BEN]: WELL, LYDIA WAS HONEST ABOUT ONE THING, ANYWAY. SHE REALLY WAS IN PRISON. [GASPS AND SNATCHES FILE PHOTO] THAT'S HER! WHO? THAT'S THE WOMAN FROM THE PARK AND FROM OUR HOUSE! THAT'S PIPER'S MOTHER. NO. THIS CAN NOT BE HAPPENING. WHERE THE HELL IS LYDIA NEWMAN? I WON'T LET THEM TAKE PIPER AWAY. I WON'T. COME HERE. [PHONE STARTS RINGING AND JOANNA GASPS] [ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS] [MACHINE BEEPS] [ELECTRONIC VOICE]: YOU HAVE 114 MESSAGES. HOW MANY? [BEEP] [EERIE DISTORTED CRACKLING PLAYS IN MESSAGE] [BEEP] MAKE IT STOP. IT'S FREAKING ME OUT. [BEEP, DISTORTED CRACKLING PLAYS] WHAT'VE WE GOT OURSELVES INTO? [DISTORTED MESSAGES PLAYING] [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] YEAH, YOU GOT IT BACK. THAT'S A GOOD ONE. NICE. [JOANNA]: WELL, IT'S VERY KIND OF YOU TO COME OVER. [BETH]: OH, NOT AT ALL. WE'RE HAPPY TO DO IT. IT WAS GREAT TO SEE PIPER. YEAH. HOW'S SHE BEEN ADJUSTING, BY THE WAY? GREAT. JUST GREAT. BRIGHT LITTLE GIRL. VERY LOVING. SO, UH... NO EPISODES? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, WE LOVED THAT LITTLE SWEETHEART RIGHT FROM THE START. YEAH, AND SHE APPEARED TO LOVE LIVING WITH US. WE BONDED RIGHT OFF THE BAT. BUT YOU'RE SAYING SOMETHING HAPPENED? [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] SHE STUCK A KNIFE IN A LIGHT SOCKET ONE AFTERNOON. YEAH. SHE GAVE HERSELF QUITE A SHOCK, TOO. [BETH]: AT FIRST, WE THOUGHT IT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT. [JOHN]: YEAH, BUT THEN SHE TRIED TO ELECTROCUTE HERSELF AGAIN. THIS TIME, WHILE IN THE TUB WITH ONE OF THE OTHER KIDS. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT MOST OF THESE CHILDREN ARE VERY TROUBLED WHEN THEY COME TO LIVE WITH US, AND WE'RE USED TO IT, BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT. YEAH. I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU. WE WERE SCARED TO DEATH, AND WE TOLD LYDIA THAT. WHAT'D SHE TELL YOU TO DO? SHE DIDN'T. NO, SHE JUST CAME AND TOOK HER AWAY. DURING THESE EPISODES, DID PIPER EVER MENTION HER BIRTH MOTHER COMING BACK TO GET HER? WELL, ALL THE CHILDREN DO THAT IN A ROUNDABOUT WAY. "WHERE DID MOMMY GO?" "WHY DID DADDY LEAVE?" BUT PIPER? OH, POOR THING. SHE WAS 100% CONVINCED THAT HER MOMMY WAS COMING BACK FOR HER. EVEN CLAIMED TO SEE HER, WHEN WE WERE SHOPPING. [EXHALES SHAKILY] BUT... I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT. I MEAN, THEY ALL DO THAT SORT OF THING TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. SHE HAD NO IDEA THAT HER MOTHER WAS IN PRISON? NO, SHE DIDN'T. MR. AND MRS. HARLAND, HAS PIPER'S BIRTH MOTHER TRIED TO CONTACT YOU RECENTLY? THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. WAIT, UH... YOU DON'T KNOW, DO YOU? KNOW WHAT? PIPER'S MOTHER... IS DEAD. SHE HANGED HERSELF IN HER PRISON CELL NOT LONG AFTER SHE SIGNED HER RIGHTS AWAY. [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] RUTH! [SCREAMING] I WANT MY DAUGHTER! HELP! ANYBODY! I NEED SOME HELP! GET HER... [SCREAMING WITH EFFORT] [ROARING IN RAGE] IT'S VERY UNUSUAL. OBVIOUSLY, I'VE SEEN THEM GET VIOLENT BEFORE, BUT IT'S NEVER DIRECTED AT THEMSELVES. IT'S LUCKY I GOT HERE WHEN I DID. THANK YOU, GRETCHEN. WE BOTH REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE. DID SHE SAY ANYTHING? SHE SAID, "I WANT MY DAUGHTER." IT SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME, TOO. LIKE SHE WAS POSSESSED. I KNOW THIS IS ALL STRANGE FOR YOU. YOU CALL ME IF YOU NEED ANY MORE HELP. OKAY? YOU'VE REACHED THE OFFICE OF MARGOT LACE, ATTORNEY AT LAW. PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE, AND I WILL GET BACK TO YOU AS SOON AS I CAN. [BEEP] MISS LACE, MY NAME IS JOANNA MAXWELL. I GOT YOUR NUMBER FROM THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU WERE WORKING ON AN APPEAL FOR A CLIENT OF YOURS, NAMED ASHLEY HENDERSON, WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE IN PRISON. IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HER DEATH, I'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU. AGAIN, MY NAME IS JOANNA MAXWELL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. IT'S WORTH A TRY. IF THERE'S MORE TO THIS, SHE'LL KNOW. YOU GOING TO TELL ME? TELL YOU WHAT? WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE STEWING ON IN YOUR HEAD. I KNOW HOW YOU WORK, SWEETHEART. YOU CHEW ON SOMETHING, AND THEN YOU WAIT UNTIL AFTER I CLOSE MY EYES BEFORE YOU LAUNCH INTO A DETAILED DIATRIBE THAT'LL GO ON FOR HOURS. OR NOT. [SIGHS] I'M THINKING WE SHOULD CALL THE POLICE. THE POLICE? I'M JUST THROWING IT OUT THERE. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO TELL THEM? THAT A GHOST IS ATTEMPTING TO KIDNAP OUR CHILD? NO. MAYBE WE CAN TELL THEM ABOUT LYDIA, COME CLEAN ABOUT WHAT SHE'S DONE. MAYBE THEY'LL KNOW HOW TO FIND HER. OH, SURE, AFTER THEY TAKE PIPER AWAY FROM US. NO WAY. WE'RE NOT GOING TO INVOLVE THE POLICE. IT'S TOO RISKY. THEN YOU THINK OF SOMETHING. AT LEAST I'M TRYING TO PROTECT OUR DAUGHTER. OH, THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT? I'M NOT DOING ENOUGH? I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN THAT. ACTUALLY, I THINK YOU DID, AND YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S NOT FAIR. GOOD NIGHT. BEN, PLEASE-- I CAN'T BELIEVE I LET YOU TALK ME INTO THIS. THIS WHOLE THING IS YOUR FAULT. BEN, DON'T DO THIS. [SIGHS HEAVILY] BEN? [SCREAMS] I WANT MY DAUGHTER. [GASPING IN TERROR] [RECORDING CRACKLES] [CRACKLY VOICE SINGING] â™ª GOOSEY GOOSEY GANDER WHERE SHALL I WANDER... â™ª â™ª UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS â™ª AND IN MY LADY'S CHAMBER â™ª THERE I MET AN OLD MAN â™ª WHO WOULDN'T STAY IN BED â™ª I TOOK HIM BY THE LEFT LEG â™ª AND THREW HIM DOWN THE STAIRS â™ª â™ª GOOSEY GOOSEY GANDER WHERE SHALL I WANDER... â™ª â™ª UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS... [LAUGHS WICKEDLY] [DIAL SPINNING] "M" IS FOR "MONKEY." "I" IS FOR "IGLOO." "N" IS FOR "NAIL." "E" IS FOR "ELK"... [GASPS IN FEAR] MINE, MINE, MINE, MINE! [GHOSTLY VOICE REPEATING] [CYMBALS CLANGING] â™ª GOOSEY GOOSEY GANDER WHERE SHALL I WANDER... â™ª I WANT MY DAUGHTER. YOU CAN'T HAVE HER, SHE'S OURS NOW! GO BACK TO THE LIGHT, OR WHATEVER YOU DO! YOU'RE DEAD! â™ª ...GRABBED HIM BY THE LEG AND THREW HIM DOWN THE STAIRS â™ª â™ª GOOSEY GOOSEY GANDER-- [ROARS ANGRILY] [SCREAMS] WHERE'S PIPER? SHE'S GONE. WHAT? PIPER! [SPLUTTERING AND CRYING] [COUGHING] BEN... GO INSIDE. GO INSIDE NOW. WHAT DO WE DO? I DON'T KNOW. [CELL PHONE RINGS] [RINGING] [CLICKS TO ANSWER] HELLO. JOANNA, IT'S GRETCHEN. IT'S GRETCHEN. HI, GRETCHEN. YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ARE IN TERRIBLE DANGER, BUT I THINK I KNOW SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP. UPON DEATH, A SPIRIT IS ESSENTIALLY NOTHING MORE THAN RAW EMOTION. THINGS LIKE LOGIC, REASON, AND EMPATHY HAVE ALL GONE OUT THE WINDOW. ONLY THE STRONGEST EMOTIONS REMAIN. SO SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY HER DAUGHTER ISN'T WITH HER-- SHE JUST KNOWS IT'S OUR FAULT? HOW MUCH OF HER MEMORY IS INTERTWINED WITH HER BASIC FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT INSTINCTS IS MORE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. IN YOUR SITUATION, SHE CLEARLY KNOWS SHE HAS A DAUGHTER AND THE NEED TO GET HER BACK IS OVERRIDING EVERYTHING ELSE. BUT WHY CAN'T SHE JUST TAKE PIPER? [PROFESSOR]: IN LAYMAN'S TERMS? SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW. HER BASIC ABILITY TO MANIPULATE HER SURROUNDINGS IS ALL NEW TO HER. BUT SHE'LL LEARN? IN SOME WAYS, HER LEARNING CURVE HAS ALREADY BEGUN. SHE FOUND YOU, AND NOW YOUR MOTHER. GRETCHEN'S RIGHT. IN HER CURRENT STATE, SHE EQUATES HURTING YOU WITH GETTING HER DAUGHTER BACK. IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE, ISN'T IT? MOST LIKELY, YES. SOMETIMES, WHEN A PERSON DIES IN A STATE OF EXTREME EMOTION, THEIR SPIRIT WON'T PASS OVER UNTIL THEY HAVE JUSTICE. UNLESS WE INTERCEDE, I DOUBT SHE'LL GIVE UP UNTIL SHE'S BROUGHT PIPER OVER TO HER SIDE. SHE WANTS TO KILL HER OWN DAUGHTER? I'M AFRAID SO. BECAUSE TO HER, YOU SEE, THIS IS NOT SUCH A BAD THING. IT'S A WAY TO REUNITE THEM... FOREVER. I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN. THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WE CAN DO TO PROTECT OURSELVES. GRETCHEN, ARE YOU UP TO IT? MAYBE LYDIA'S APARTMENT DOESN'T SEEM THAT INSANE. YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA? I KNOW. IT FEELS OVER THE TOP, BUT IT WORKS. NATIVE AMERICANS HAVE BEEN USING WHITE SAGE TO CHASE AWAY NEGATIVE ENERGY FOR CENTURIES. OKAY, JUST... A LITTLE OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE. DON'T WORRY. THE CLEANSES WE'VE DONE HAVE ALL BEEN SUCCESSFUL. AND IF THIS ONE ISN'T? A MORE POWERFUL EXORCISM MAY BE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO CONVINCE PIPER'S MOM TO MOVE ON TO THE OTHER SIDE. ARE WE READY? THEN LET'S BEGIN. REMEMBER, BE FORCEFUL, BUT NOT BELLIGERENT. ANTAGONIZING A SPIRIT COULD BRING ABOUT A VIOLENT REACTION. OKAY, WAIT A SECOND. ARE WE SURE THAT, UH, WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS? BEN, LET'S TRY AND STAY POSITIVE ABOUT THIS. THEY'RE TRYING TO HELP US. [PROFESSOR]: JOANNA'S RIGHT. I'M NOT TRYING TO FRIGHTEN YOU, BUT WE DO NEED TO BE UNITED IN OUR PURPOSE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT PICKING A FIGHT. THIS IS ABOUT MAKING THE SPIRIT SEE THAT ITS PRESENCE WON'T BE TOLERATED. SPIRIT, WE MEAN YOU NO HARM. PLEASE LEAVE THIS PLACE IN PEACE. SPIRIT, WE MEAN YOU NO HARM. PLEASE LEAVE THIS PLACE IN PEACE. YOU ARE DEAD, SO WE WISH YOU WELL TO SEEK THE LIGHT. PLEASE LEAVE THIS PLACE IN PEACE. SPIRIT, WE MEAN YOU NO HARM. LEAVE THIS PLACE IN PEACE. SO, WE WISH YOU WELL TO SEEK THE LIGHT. SPIRIT, WE MEAN YOU NO HARM. PLEASE LEAVE THIS PLACE IN PEACE. [MECHANICAL LAUGHTER] [MEWLING] [MECHANICAL LAUGHTER ECHOING] [RATTLING] [YELPS IN SHOCK] [GASPS] YOU HAVE NO POWER OVER THE MEMBERS OF THIS HOME ANY LONGER! [SHATTERING] [WIND GUSTING] THIS HOUSE IS FOR THE LIVING NOT THE DEAD! SEEK THE LIGHT! LEAVE THIS PLACE, IN PEACE! [SHATTERING] SEEK THE LIGHT! LEAVE US! [UNEARTHLY SCREAMING] [MIRROR SHATTERING] IS THAT IT? YEAH. YEAH, I THINK THAT'S IT. WE CAN'T FORCE THE SPIRIT TO CROSS OVER, BUT WE CAN... KEEP IT OUT OF YOUR HOME. I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT YOUR HOUSE IS SAFE NOW. GRETCHEN, PROFESSOR SORENSON, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. OH, YOU'RE MOST WELCOME. I'M JUST SORRY WE WEREN'T ABLE TO MEET UNDER BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES. GOOD NIGHT. 'NIGHT. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE WE SHOULD KNOW? WELL, JUST RESPECT WHAT'S BEEN DONE, AND DON'T DO ANYTHING TO INVITE THE SPIRIT BACK INTO YOUR HOUSE. LIKE WHAT? ONE OF THE EASIEST WAYS FOR A SPIRIT TO INVADE A HOME IS THROUGH SEEMINGLY INNOCENT GAMES. DESPITE WHAT YOU THINK, THEY DO HAVE POWER. WHAT KIND OF GAMES? PALM READINGS, AUTOMATIC WRITINGS, TAROT CARDS, SPIRIT IN THE GLASS, ANY KIND OF INCANTATION-- OUIJA BOARD? YOU DO NOT WANT A OUIJA BOARD ANYWHERE NEAR THIS HOUSE. THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF THING WE DO AROUND HERE ON A REGULAR BASIS. THEN YOU'LL BE FINE. WELL, THANK YOU. I'M GLAD I COULD HELP. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. "AND LARRY THE LOON AND MILDRED THE MALLARD "LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER. THE END." DADDY, DO I STILL HAVE TWO MOMMIES? YES, YOU ALWAYS WILL. WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE A VERY LUCKY LITTLE GIRL. FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAD A BIRTH MOTHER, AND SHE CARRIED YOU IN HER TUMMY, YOU KNOW, AND THEN, WHEN SHE GOT SICK AND SHE WENT TO HEAVEN, SHE LOVED YOU SO MUCH, THAT SHE MADE PLANS FOR YOU TO LIVE WITH A NEW MOMMY AND DADDY SO THAT YOU WOULD ALWAYS BE TAKEN CARE OF. PIPER, WILL YOU TELL ME IF YOU EVER SEE YOUR MOMMY AGAIN? THERE SHE IS. [LAUGHS] HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN STANDING THERE? LONG ENOUGH. PIPER, IT'S BEDTIME. COME ON. HOP IN THERE. I LOVE YOU. 'NIGHT, SWEETHEART. - HELLO! - HI! GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. GOOD TO SEE YOU. SO, YOU THINK I COULD GET ONE OF THESE? ABSOLUTELY. [CHUCKLES FONDLY] EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT AT HOME? PIPER'S GOOD? SHE'S GREAT. ACTUALLY, EVERYTHING'S... PERFECT. BE HONEST. NO PROBLEMS? NONE. WHAT YOU DID FOR US, I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH. I'LL HAVE THIS FOR YOU NEXT TIME I SEE YOU. GREAT, THANKS. DO YOU REMEMBER THESE? IT'S A FAMILY NEWSLETTER DAD USED TO MAIL OUT EVERY YEAR WHEN I WAS A KID. HE LOVED BRAGGING TO HIS FRIENDS ABOUT HIS FAMILY. I THREW ALL THOSE AWAY. I REMEMBER THAT, TOO. YOUR FATHER SAID I SHOULD DO IT. NO, HE DIDN'T, MOM. HE SAID YOU SHOULD PUT THEM AWAY FOR THE GRANDKIDS, BUT YOU SAID YOU NEEDED THE STORAGE. YOUR FATHER SAID-- I'M NOT LYING, MOM. WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION MANY TIMES. [SIGHS] MOM... I-I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT DAD. I'D LIKE TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND-- YOUR FATHER'S DEAD. I KNOW HE IS, BUT I'M NOT. IT'S JUST YOU AND ME NOW, MOM, AND I'D LIKE TO GET TO KNOW YOU... BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. [SIGHS] JOANNA... I'D LIKE THAT, TOO. SERIOUSLY? YOU TOLD GRETCHEN EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT? IT IS. REALLY? NOTHING'S MISSING. WE'RE JUST ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY? CALL DYLAN. NO, I'VE HAD ENOUGH DRAMA FOR ONE DAY. HE WON'T WANT TO TALK TO ME ANYWAY. COME ON, WHEN DO YOU EVER CALL HIM? NEVER. SO IT MIGHT MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I GUESS. NO, LET ME REPHRASE THAT. IT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WHILE YOU'RE REACHING OUT TO FAMILY? GIVE IT A TRY. [SIGHING NERVOUSLY] [CELL PHONE RINGS] HELLO? DYLAN! HEY, IT'S JOANNA. HOW ARE YOU? HEY. I GOTTA GO. I'M IN A BIT OF A HURRY. I CAN'T REALLY TALK ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW. WAIT. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. YOU KNOW, UM, I THOUGHT, WITH THE LONG WEEKEND COMING, YOU MIGHT WANT TO... COME HOME, SPEND SOME TIME AT THE HOUSE. YOU WANT ME TO COME HOME? LOOK, I KNOW THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN GREAT BETWEEN US LATELY, AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN TOUGH ON YOU, HAVING PIPER JOIN OUR FAMILY, BUT THAT'S NO EXCUSE FOR HOW I'VE TREATED YOU. IT'S ALL RIGHT. I SHOULDN'T HAVE YELLED AT YOU, EITHER. YOU KNOW, A LOT'S BEEN GOING ON AROUND HERE LATELY, AND... I MISS YOU, DYLAN. I MISS YOUR PRESENCE IN THIS FAMILY. SO, COME HOME, OKAY? PIPER NEEDS HER BIG BROTHER. MY DAD REALLY DOESN'T DESERVE YOU. YOU READ MY MIND. [CHUCKLES] LOOK... TELL DAD TO PICK ME UP TONIGHT. REALLY? YEAH, LONG WEEKENDS SUCK AROUND HERE. THERE'S NOBODY'S AROUND. THAT'S GREAT. WE'LL SEE YOU SOON. I LOVE YOU, DYLAN. YEAH, I KNOW. [STATIC WHINES AND CRACKLES] [FEEDBACK WHINING] DYLAN? WHAT WAS THAT? HEY, MUST BE MY BATTERY. UM, I'LL SEE YOU SOON. BYE. THAT WAS AMAZING. I REALLY DON'T DESERVE YOU. WELL, AT LEAST WE ALL AGREE ON SOMETHING. GO GET HIM. WELL, THANK YOU FOR AGREEING TO SEE ME, MISS LACE. IT'S MY PLEASURE. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I WAS SURPRISED TO GET YOUR CALL REGARDING ASHLEY HENDERSON. SHE WASN'T A BAD PERSON. SHE JUST GOT CAUGHT UP WITH THE WRONG CROWD. A BREAKING AND ENTERING CONVICTION PUT HER BEHIND BARS FOR 26 MONTHS. IT WAS HARD ON HER, BUT SHE KNEW SHE'D BE REUNITED WITH HER DAUGHTER WHEN IT WAS OVER, SO SHE STAYED OUT OF TROUBLE, HOPING FOR AN EARLY RELEASE. THEN LYDIA TRICKED HER INTO PERMANENTLY SIGNING AWAY HER PARENTAL RIGHTS, AND ASHLEY'S WORLD CAME CRASHING DOWN AROUND HER. [ASHLEY]: WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CAN'T REAPPLY FOR CUSTODY WHEN I GET OUT? [CRYING]: THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS TOLD. WHEN I-WHEN I SIGNED THE PAPERS, THE LADY SAID IT WAS ONLY TEMPORARY-- IT'S NOT FINAL! YOU'RE NOT LISTENING! THAT'S MY BABY. SHE'S MINE! YOU CAN'T-- HELLO? HELLO... [SOBBING] WHY WON'T ANYBODY HELP ME? THEY STOLE MY LITTLE GIRL... [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] [JOANNA]: I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. YOU'RE SAYING LYDIA SOLD PIPER? OR TRIED TO, ANYWAY. WE'VE GOT TO FIND LYDIA. SHE NEEDS TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT SHE'S DONE-- UNFORTUNATELY, THERE'S NO WAY TO PROVE ANY OF IT. NOT WITHOUT THE TESTIMONY OF THE ATTORNEY OR THE COUPLE WHO PAID LYDIA, AND THEY'VE ALL VANISHED. I HOPE THEY GOT WHAT'S COMING TO THEM. [CAR ALARM CHIRPS] [STATIC CRACKLES ON STEREO] I REALLY APPRECIATED JOANNA'S CALL. YOU SHOULD TELL HER THAT. I WILL. BUT FIRST, I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. I WAS MORE MAD AT YOU THAN I WAS AT JOANNA. ME? YEAH, DAD. YOU. WHY? BECAUSE... SOMETIMES, I NEED YOU TO BE AS INTERESTED IN MY LIFE AS YOU ARE IN YOUR NEW ONE-- THAT'S NOT FAIR. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON. DOES IT MATTER? DYLAN, LOOK, I... [SIGHS] I'M SORRY. NO MORE EXCUSES. WILL YOU FORGIVE ME? I ALREADY HAVE. YOU'RE MY RIDE HOME. IT'S PRETTY QUIET TONIGHT. MRS. BURTON'S FOOT IS SWELLING AGAIN, BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT. THANKS, GRETCH. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. I WILL, JUST AS SOON AS I GET ALL THESE FILES DONE. EVERYONE BAILED ALREADY, HUH? YEAH, NOBODY WASTES ANY TIME. YOU FEEL THAT? [TOY SQUAWKS]: "M" IS FOR MONKEY. "A" IS FOR APPLE. "X" IS FOR-- NO GIRLFRIEND, SERIOUSLY? LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT IT. TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING. ONE LESS REASON TO HAVE YOUR HOUSE BLESSED. WHAT? LONG STORY. OH, NO. NO, I'M NOT KIDDING. YOU'RE SERIOUS? YOU LET JOANNA TALK YOU INTO IT? YEAH, IT'S CALLED COMPROMISE. IT MAKES A MARRIAGE GO ROUND. I DON'T CARE. THERE'S NO WAY I'D EVER LET ANYONE TALK ME INTO EATING GREEN TEA SOUFFLE. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MISSING. [LAUGHS] OKAY, FINE, YOU'RE RIGHT. IT TASTES LIKE FEET. I KNEW IT! [LAUGHING] [FEEDBACK WHINES] [DISTORTED VOICE CRACKLES AND DRONES] WHAT-- OPEN. - OPEN-- - DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? OPEN, COME ON. COME ON... DAD? DYLAN'S COMING TO SEE YOU. NO, HE'S NOT. OF COURSE HE IS. WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT? [WHISPERING] MOMMY TOLD ME. WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY? PIPER, LOOK AT ME AND TELL ME WHAT YOU SAID. [WHISPERING] I CAN'T. IT'S A SECRET. [DIALING CELL PHONE] [RINGING] HI, IT'S BEN. LEAVE A MESSAGE. HEY, BEN, IT'S ME, JUST CHECKING IN. CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THIS. YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. WHAT'S GOING ON? DON'T WORRY, SOMEONE WILL BE HERE SOON. [SHATTERS] DAMN IT... YOU SAID A BAD WORD! AND I'M SORRY. I'M JUST WORRIED. [CELL PHONE RINGS] HELLO? [FEEDBACK WHINES, JOANNA WINCES] BEN? JOANNA, I'M AT THE SCHOOL. WE NEED HELP. WE NEED HELP, JOANNA. SEND HELP. BEN, WHAT'S GOING ON? BEN! PIPER, WE GOTTA GO. [GASPS IN HORROR] LYDIA. [DISTORTED VOICE WARBLES WITH STATIC] WHAT WAS THAT? [DIALING CELL PHONE] PICK UP THE PHONE, JOANNA. PICK UP THE PHONE... [CELL PHONE RINGS] LYDIA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? [CELL PHONE RINGING] HELLO, HAPPY FAMILY. [GASPS] GERTIE! PIPER, NO! MOMMY GAVE GERTIE TO ME WHEN SHE WENT AWAY-- MY FIRST MOMMY. PLEASE... PLEASE GIVE HER BACK TO ME. IT'S TIME TO GO, SWEETHEART. YOUR MOMMY WANTS YOU BACK. HER MOTHER IS DEAD, LYDIA. DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW THAT? HER SPIRIT WON'T STOP TORTURING ME. BUT I'M GOING TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT. I KNOW WHAT TO DO NOW. PIPER NEEDS TO JOIN HER MOMMY ON THE OTHER SIDE. NO. IT'S THE ONLY WAY. I HAD A WEALTHY CLIENT WHO WAS WILLING TO PAY FOR A CHILD, SO I TRICKED PIPER'S MOTHER INTO GIVING HER UP, AND NOW SHE WON'T STOP UNTIL SHE GETS HER BACK. NOT EVEN GIVING HER TO YOU COULD CHANGE THAT. I WON'T LET YOU DO THIS, LYDIA. YOU IDIOT, DON'T YOU GET IT? IF I DON'T DO THIS, SHE'S GOING TO KILL YOU, JUST LIKE SHE KILLED MY OTHER CLIENTS! [TELEPHONE RINGS] OH GOD, LEAVE ME ALONE! [SCREAMING] GOD, LEAVE ME ALONE! LEAVE ME ALONE! [SCREAMING] LEAVE ME ALONE! LEAVE ME ALONE! [SCREAMING IN RAGE] [SMASH] [CELL PHONE RINGING] COME ON, PICK UP, PICK UP. [DISTORTED VOICE SCREECHING AND FEEDING BACK] [BEEPS PHONE OFF] I CALLED THE DIOCESE AS SOON AS I GOT YOUR MESSAGE. GOOD. LET'S GO. WE'VE GOT TO HURRY. [SLIDING HEAVY DRESSER] [BANGING ON DOOR] GIVE ME THE GIRL! GIVE ME THE GIRL! [BANGING VIOLENTLY] GIVE ME THE GIRL! [SCREAMING IN TERROR] [SHATTERING] DAD, WHAT'S GOING ON? DON'T SAY ANYTHING. [STATIC CRACKLING] WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU! HURTING US WON'T MAKE THINGS EVEN! [WHISPERING] I THINK SHE'S GONE. "SHE"? [BLOWS POUNDING, METAL WRENCHING] WE'RE TRAPPED IN HERE! STAY BACK! GET DOWN, DYLAN, GET DOWN! [EERIE SHRIEKING] I'M SORRY, DYLAN! IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT! [BLOWS POUNDING] [SCRAPING AND RENDING] [ABRUPT SILENCE] [PIPER'S VOICE ECHOES]: MOMMY, HELP ME! [ELEVATOR DINGS] [POUNDING AND BANGING FROM INSIDE] GIVE ME THE GIRL! NO, I-I CAN'T GO UP THERE. I'LL GET HELP-- OH, GOD... [VIOLENT BANGING CONTINUES UPSTAIRS] GIVE ME THE GIRL! [SCREAMING IN RAGE] LEAVE ME ALONE! [WIND GUSTING] [SMASH] [BANGING VIOLENTLY] I'M SCARED. BABY, I'VE GOT YOU.

HELP ME. FOCUS, BABY. WE NEED YOUR MOMMY. [BANGING AND CHOPPING] ASK HER IN. DO IT NOW. HELP ME, MOMMY, HELP ME! [HAMMERING ON DOOR] YOUR DAUGHTER NEEDS YOU! DON'T LET THIS WOMAN HURT HER! "H", "E", "L", "P." "HELP ME. HELP ME." ARE YOU AFRAID? WHAT'S THE MATTER? TAKE PIPER AWAY! HELP ME... GIVE ME THE GIRL! YOU'LL HAVE TO KILL ME FIRST. YOU READ MY MIND. I'LL HAUNT YOU TO YOUR GRAVE, THAT'S A PROMISE. [GHOSTLY VOICE]: MINE... [GASPING] OH, GOD... MOMMY? [SCREAMS] NO! GET BACK! GO AWAY! I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU! NO. SHE'S TRYING TO HURT PIPER! NO... I'M SORRY I TRICKED YOU, OKAY? I'M TRYING TO REUNITE YOU! THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, RIGHT? THAT'S WHAT YOU-- GET BACK... I CAN STILL FIX IT. YOU'LL BOTH BE DEAD. YOU'LL BE TOGETHER FOREVER. ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS LET ME KILL YOUR DAUGHTER! [SCREAMING] [BODY THUDS HEAVILY] [GASPING IN HORROR] [GROANING WEAKLY] [KNIFE SQUELCHES] [GASPS IN SHOCK] [DOOR SLAMS] [GHOSTLY VOICE]: MINE! MINE... JOANNA! IT'S OKAY, BABY. IT'S OKAY. [WIND GUSTING] JOANNA! OH, MY GOD.... [ELECTRICITY CRACKLES] PLEASE DON'T DO IT. WHAT KIND OF A MOTHER ARE YOU? TRY AND REMEMBER. YOU LOVE YOUR DAUGHTER. YOU WOULDN'T HURT HER. YOU LOVE HER, AND PIPER LOVES YOU. MOMMY! MAKE HER GO AWAY! MAKE IT STOP! SHE CAN'T GO WITH YOU. SHE'S BETTER OFF HERE WITH ME. I'LL TAKE REALLY GOOD CARE OF HER, I PROMISE. I LOVE HER. I LOVE PIPER. PLEASE DON'T TAKE HER AWAY. [SOBBING] PLEASE. PLEASE DON'T DO IT. PIPER, YOUR MOMMY LOVES YOU VERY MUCH, AND ALWAYS WILL. BOTH YOUR MOMMYS. YOU OKAY? OH... [ALL CHEERING] HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY! WHO WANTS A PIECE? I DO, I DO, I DO! [LAUGHTER] OKAY, COMING RIGHT UP. CAN YOU SHARE IT? YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BEAT ME TO IT. GO DEEP. YOU GOT THIS? OH, NICE TRY. WHAT KIND OF THROW WAS THAT? YOU GOTTA JUMP. I THOUGHT YOU WERE AN ATHLETE. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? JUST A BRIGHT FUTURE FOR OUR FAMILY. I THINK YOUR MOM'S HAVING A GOOD TIME. YEAH, YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING WE COULD CONSIDER MOVING HER INTO THE HOUSE. A LOT OF MEDICAL RESEARCH SAYS ALLOWING ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS TO LIVE IN THE PAST IS THE BEST WAY TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM. YEAH, JUST I'D HATE TO SEE YOU REVISIT THAT HURT. WELL, I'M MORE INCLINED TO THINK OF IT AS A DO-OVER. MAYBE WE COULD EVEN FIND THAT BOND EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT. YOU'RE A GOOD DAUGHTER, JOANNA MAXWELL, AND A GREAT MOTHER. OH, COME ON, GIVE ME A BREAK. OH, YOU DON'T AGREE? WELL, LET'S GET REAL, PEOPLE. I STILL DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED, BUT, ALL THE SAME, WHAT SHE DID TO SAVE PIPER WAS... UNBELIEVABLE. DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT. YOU'RE A FANTASTIC MOTHER, AND ANYBODY WHO SAYS DIFFERENTLY IS CRAZY. I WANT YOU TO KNOW, I'D DO THE SAME FOR YOU, REAL MOM OR NOT. I LOVE YOU, DYLAN. I KNOW YOU DO, AND THAT'S COOL. MAYBE SOMEDAY, YOU AND MY MOM CAN BE FRIENDS. I'D LIKE THAT. SOMETHING TELLS ME IF IT INVOLVES ANOTHER MOTHER, YOU CAN WORK IT OUT. [PIPER SINGING] â™ª UPSTAIRS AND DOWNSTAIRS â™ª AND IN MY LADY'S CHAMBER [SINGING TOGETHER]: â™ª I TOOK HIM BY THE LEFT LEG â™ª AND THREW HIM DOWN THE STAIRS... â™ª [CHUCKLING] [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª] [GHOSTLY VOICE WHISPERS] MINE...
