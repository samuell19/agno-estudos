I remember that summer day so well. Oh, that's lovely. It's perfect on you! Tetsuko, when someone says something nice, you say "Thank you". It's not even that pretty. Thank you... Oh, that's all right, I wasn't trying to make you say thank you. I really do think you're cute. Natsuko! Stop that! Why would you do such a thing? This was how Natsuko answered. It looks better on me! I don't wanna be like anyone else! I'd rather die! - I know. Natsuko. - Sorry, 'sis. Now, now, Natsuko. Everything was Granny's fault. Don't cry, OK? Since I was a little girl, I've always felt alone in the world. You're her father! Now you want a divorce? Next up, let's listen to 1990 hit "Odoru Ponpokolin". "1994 Bar Exam Oral examination test results:" "187: Tetsuko Ishida" "Resume" If you'd please. I'm hired? Welcome to Ogiwara Law Firm. Congratulations! ...Attorney Tetsuko. Miss Ishida, isn't it? I'm Sakaguchi. We sat next to each other in Mr. Ogiwara's seminar. Oh... hello. But even with a career and a family, I still felt empty inside... The more time I spent with someone else, the lonelier I felt... From that morning, I knew it wasn't going to be my clay. "Ogiwara Law Firm" Good morning. Are you OK?! Towel! Hurry in here. Ah, you can't have a meeting in that state. Meeting? A client's waiting. She wants to retain your services. Hey, it's been forever! How's it going? You haven't changed a bit! Same old straight-laced style! Wait! You don't recognize me? It's Natsuko! Your cousin Natsuko! It's crazy that you became a lawyer. I mean, I heard you were studious, but I had to see it to believe it. I need your help. You see, a guy I was engaged to is demanding money for pain and suffering. That's terrible. - Are you OK? - You need representation. Exactly. I'm in deep trouble. I didn't do a single thing wrong. I just fell out of love and broke it off. Hey, Tetsu. I don't need to pay him, right? Please, look after me! I don't wanna pay a penny! I'd rather die! I don't wanna be like anyone else! I'd rather die! Hey... Do you remember that time? That time? The sunflower dress. DESPERATE SUNFLOWERS Don't talk bull! 'Course she should pay. I blew all kinds of money on her. - But... - No buts! Suddenly cooled on me, she said. I don't get it. - But... - I'm sayin'! Men get hurt, too. Ain't as tough as I look. You tell Natsu. Lawyer or not, I ain't droppin' my claim. Understood. I'll come another day. Hey! I have more to say. What? I... wasn't taken for a ride, was I? Fun while it lasted! Hey, lady. Your phone. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Hi, Tetsu! Natsu... You didn't try to scam Akio, right? Say what? Can't hear! I heard you tried to have him sign over his apartment building to you. As soon as his parents stopped it, you broke off the engagement. So? Ain't a big deal, right? It's a very big deal. If it's true, it's a major obstacle in your case. If you got to know Akio with fraudulent intent... Hey, if I said I was serious about him, then I was. Nobody knows my true feelings. I won! Super bonus! I don't give up so easily. Are you all right? I'm defending a marriage swindler... It's his fault he got fooled. Pouring money into a transparent woman like that. Maybe he had fun. People don't show up here until they've hit rock bottom, you know? They're liable to forget, but no matter how much a couple fights, they had a time when they were happy. Um... what about Natsu? I conveyed your message, but I'll be handling all negotiation on her behalf. What did you want to discuss? Well... Hi, everyone! Oh, hello. Natsu! What is this? I don't wanna battle with you in court. We used to be in love, and now it's all just so sad. What'd I do wrong? I still want you to be mine! Forget the financial compensation. I convinced my parents. Come back to me, Natsu. If there's something about me that you hate, I'll fix it. Let's try again. I'm begging you. If you come back to me- You'll drop that lawsuit? I promise. Oh, thank you, Akio! So you're coming back to me? 'Course I'm not. You'll have a better life... without me. See you. Bye. Thanks! Thank you! "Goodbye to one, Goodbye to one, Hello to another..." Will you put the withdrawal of your claim in writing? One time Natsu asked me... what I'd do if I won $10,000. What would you do if you won $10,000? Why the sudden question? I was just wondering what you'd do. Isn't there something you wanna do? When I was a kid, I dreamed about riding a motorbike around Japan. That's awesome! Dreams are just dreams. Make your dreams come true starting today. If you think that way, you can go wherever you want. Your life is what you make of it! Whoa, that flew! Being with Natsu was always fun. She made me feel like... I had a future. How do you explain this? What happened to our fees? I went to Natsuko's house, but she's moved out. I asked her parents, but they don't know either. We work from request to settlement. Yes. I found it a while ago and just bought it. I know you like stationary. Thank you. That was a tough case. Natsuko might have a gift for making people dream big. That's not a good thing. He'd get physically abusive if the housework wasn't done... It must've been very hard. Tetsuko! Excuse me, but would you mind taking off your mask so we can document your injuries? Please. Continue telling us what happened. Sorry. I can't believe it. Someone who used to be so kind, becoming a monster like that. I really can't understand how things became this way... What should I do? The client has no intention of getting a divorce. Spending more time is futile. A simple conclusion, but listening to a client is important. Tetsuko, you're too cold and efficient. We've had clients request we change their lawyer to a better listener. Have you? Aren't you tired? In those heels. Maybe we need... some time apart. Yeah. At some point, rather than being suspicious, or becoming jealous, or growing angry, I simply chose what to accept. Things are much easier that way. Happy birthday. Thank you! Open it. It's lovely! Tetsuko has good taste. It's nice. I've cut some for you. Sorry, I've always eaten them this way. But my teeth aren't so strong anymore. Mr. Isozaki! Yes. How about some tea, everyone? Over there. All done. Thanks. Thank you. Whether the plaintiff or defendant wins, one of them ends up disappointed. In short... Just winning a lawsuit is not enough for a client. Increasing their satisfaction means more than legal victories. Yes, I understand. Maybe it should wait until after we eat. I feel sorry only one of us has to eat later. It's a bit of a walk, but these are the best cold noodles. Basically, our line of work has pros and cons. Even if you win a case, you have to go through bitter experiences. As his trainer, say a few words Tetsuko. No comment... Are you all right, Mr. Isozaki? A pained expressions like that will drive clients away. Virgo's aren't so though. I may not be cut out for law. What's that? Long time no see, Tetsu! Whoa. Natsuko! That Natsuko? Thanks for the lift. So long! You've aged. What's your business today? Huh? Did you get divorced? No way! We're both one-time losers. Since I last saw you, my husband divorced me. Said it was for our son's sake. Surprised? Yes. More that you got married. Hey! That's not nice. Seeing as I'm bringing you work and all. Work? Hey, look at my boy Koichi. I gave him that name so he'd always be happy! Work? A guy named Shima gladly bought a picture from me. A painting, you know? Now he's saying... he wants his money back. Can you help? Only a jerk would ask for a refund a year later, don't you think? I didn't do anything wrong. I was just a go-between. Oh, but leave him out of it. Nothing to do with it. And the guy demanding a refund? No, not demanding. Threatening. Threats! Shima's a nasty piece of work. That's why I'm here. Help me out. OK? Yeah? Who do you think paid the fees for your last case? Oh, well, that was... I refuse. But, Tetsu! We'll take your case. - Really? - Yes. For real?! We can't turn a blind eye to clients in trouble. Not a chance. I'm busy with another case. OK. Isozaki, you take it. Me? Yes! Awesome! Thank you for backing me up. Hello. "Art-Think Ltd. Natsuko Kotani" Seems like the facts don't match with Natsuko's story. Here you are. So... why wait one year to ask for a refund? May we see the painting you purchased? Oh, sure. $20,000 for this? You realize it's counterfeit, right? You didn't soon find out it wasn't worth $20,000? Natsuko... Yes? Natsuko said it was a great painting. A rare work of art. I always thought buying and selling art was a fishy business. And it is. Selling an obvious fake like that for big money. Oh, boy. What kind of person was Shima? He didn't really seem into paintings. Not much of a talker, either. I guess he knew he bought a fake, and now wants a refund. Maybe he was infatuated. Blinded by feelings for Natsuko or something. Perhaps she takes advantage of people's loneliness. Natsuko was just being Natsuko. Why a hospital? Natsuko told us to come here. Maybe she's not feeling well. The north wing... This way. Excuse me? Where's room 2311? Down that way. Stop it. Oh! By the way, I bought lottery tickets on the way here. The jackpot's unrealistic, but chances for $10,000 are pretty good. What would you do if you won, Kei? I'd get a hotel room with an outdoor hot tub. Me? I'd put it all on one horse to win at the track. No... I'd go bar hopping in Ginza. No kidding? Bar hopping? Depends on the day. When he's feeling good he talks more. Laughs, too. Surprised. You being someone's nurse. No choice. I'm his common-law wife. Common law? How's my case going? I won't have to pay, right? You knew that painting was worthless when you sold it, didn't you? Huh? It's not genuine? A real Van Gogh wouldn't cost only $20,000. But does "fake" or "genuine" really mean anything? As long as there's someone willing to pay $20,000 whether it's real or not, it's worth $20,000, right? Understand that I'm representing you as a person. This time, be prepared to pay up. What?! Tetsu! Making sure I don't have to pay is your job! Excuse me. I'm regretting it. Defending someone like her... Well... eat something sweet. Take a little break. The caramel sauce is bitter, so it brings out the sweetness. Delicious. People can't be angry while they're eating pudding. As always... thank you... I'm back! Welcome back. Hey, pudding! Looks tasty! There's some new info regarding Natsuko's case. I'd like to meet with this person. Can you take a look, please? - I get some, too? - Of course. Thanks a lot! Enjoy. Pudding time. Here it is. Oh, I guess I should put that away. When we got married, Natsuko mentioned that her cousin was a lawyer. In fact, Natsuko has retained our services. Has she had any financial trouble recently? She had been behind on her rent. But now she's paying it on time. That's because I'm paying it for her. She was about to claim personal bankruptcy. We suspected as much. We'd like to ask how this situation arose. I'm trying to understand it myself. This question may be intrusive. Why pay her rent after getting divorced? Well... How should I put it? Basically... I'm worried about her. We may have split up, but I'm concerned. - See ya! - See ya tomorrow! Bye, Koichi. See ya tomorrow. - I'm home. - Hi. This is your mom's cousin, Ms. Ishida. And... Isozaki. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. She's your mom's lawyer. Your mom's in Shizuoka- I dunno. Don't care. Lawyers will defend any kind of person if they get money. Wash this. Sorry. Somewhere around here. Where Natsuko sold Shima the painting. Why the heck in an area like this? Art enticers. Art advisers? Not advisers, enticers. Art scammers. Art scammers? They target weak-willed people and come onto them. Then flatter them into spending exorbitant amounts. - Do you like art? - There's a gallery nearby. - We can give you a discount. - I'm not sure... In a hurry, Ma'am? There's an art exhibit around the corner. Sorry, I'm... No thank you. Excuse me. Ma'am. My name's Ishida. Isozaki. Lawyers? Do know a woman named Natsuko Kotani? This is her. Oh, that old broad! "Old broad"? Counsel? What's your relation to her? No relation. But she's stood out, like hell. Mixing in with the younger girls and pitching men like crazy. What was it about Natsuko? There were lots of young women there. I couldn't ignore her. Other girls were getting customers but nobody stopped for Natsuko. It's all Ota's fault. Ota? Doing that for a man like him... I wanted to save her. Save her... from him. Yummy? It's sweet. Mr. Kondo, too. Hey, Kei. What were the ten best things in your life? Top ten? Let me see... Let me see... - How about you? - Me? Let me see... Natsuko Kotani has requested we establish the facts, so may we record this interview? Go for it. Thank you. May I? To the point, Shunsuke Ota, you are- It's true I had her broker the deal. But I never said $20,000. You had her sell it for $20,000, did you not? Got any proof? Didn't you have her claim it was "a rare work of art"? You were seeing each other, weren't you? Huh? She would come over and cook meals without me asking. Someone you like eating food you made? That ranks ninth. When I hear them say "It's delicious!" it makes me so happy. That broad was clueless. It was a pain. - You didn't act in a suggestive manner? - Suggestive? She's a woman, so I paid some attention. When men say I'm pretty or cute. That's fourth? "Cute" is a useful word. Girls love it. But come on... Believing it at her age? It's pathetic. Going all out, with no idea how it looks to other people. What does someone like that even have to live for? And your number one thing in life? She'd always ask me to rank my pleasures. I'm still in my 20s. I haven't lived yet. Mr. Ota... Hope she drops dead. Let's live long. - How can you say that? - So much trouble! She clung to me, and now lawyers? - We just want facts- - Look... I'm getting married. So I'm saying back off. Got it? This is my big chance. She's from a good family. Nothing like that old bitch. Follow me? No way I'm letting this cash cow go because of that bitch. Clear? You're... despicable. Screw this. You keep pushing me, friends of mine might do something. If that pretty little face got hurt it'd be a tragedy. Are we done? Are you all right? Kei. Hang on, Kei. - Morphine. - Yes. Hang in there. Kei. You're OK. You met Shunsuke? I thought you'd be reluctant, so I took it upon myself to confirm the facts. What is this? Don't act without asking. You supported Shunsuke, right? You almost went bankrupt. Stop it. Are you lecturing me? Hey, never say a word about Shunsuke to Kei! Don't you understand? A common-law wife- Enough already! So that's why Kei Hashimoto? He helped you get over Shunsuke. Now you're his care-giver? Gimme a break. There will never be another Shunsuke... Dad? Can you hear me? Just get out! Bringing a lawyer in here? No, I'm- Common-law wife or whatever you are. I'm not gonna stand by and let some gold digger do this! Natsu is... Dad? A good person... What the hell? What do you mean she's good? - Dad! - Let's go. I'm sorry. Very sorry. Natsu... What is it, Kei? After I go... will you be the heir to everything I have? Please... Well, if you insist. And one more request. What? Just say it. If... I can't breathe properly... turn that switch off for me. No, that's- I understand. Ms. Attorney. Yes? I wonder if Natsu will receive that money. That son of his rarely ever visits, but Natsu is here every day. Every day she takes care of Mr. Hashimoto. She's always kind, even to someone like me with no family. She shaved my beard. She reminds us of what's important. Natsu asked me, "What have you enjoyed most in life?" Thinking about it, it was the time I spent with my ex-wife. I want to tell her how thankful I am. So... will you help me write my will? I understand. I'll be in touch soon. Can't you do it now? I'm a sick man. Even if you promise... you might never see me again. - No need to be nervous. - OK. It'll be in writing, and we can do a retake. Um... It's Takaaki. I'm shooting this at the hospital. All kinds of people are here. An old man who used to room with me, was visited by his daughter every single day and he'd say terrible things. "I'm just a nuisance." "You'll be better off when I croak." "That's enough!" I yelled at him. If you talk like that, someday, you'll lose something precious. And then... it hit me. Gosh... I was talking about myself. I took you for granted. I didn't recognize your feelings. It must've been tough on you. When work didn't go well for me, I'd take it out on you. And then, I'd hit the bottle and get drunk. Then finally I realized... how thankful I was that you were always by my side. One time, you'd bought me a steamed meat bun. You poured tonkatsu sauce on it and gave it to me. "What the hell is this?" It should be soy sauce, Dummy. But then I tried it... It was delicious. Tonkatsu sauce was great, I thought. After that I'd always pour tonkatsu sauce on meat buns. Pathetic... Now... when I only have a little time left, I realize how important you were. I'm so sorry. It's too late... but I hope you always keep your kind face. By the time you see this I'll just be ashes. But my memories of you will never burn away. They're inside of me and I'll cherish them forever. You chose to marry me, and I'm truly thankful. Well, that became pretty gloomy. Is that so? Good thing you had a hanky. Sorry I've kept you so late. Not at all. I'm in good health. Even my doctor praised me. I'm glad. Hearing your story has made me feel that much better. That was the first time, that I empathized with someone else. To be honest, I'm still confused. It's a wonderful thing. Being moved to tears by someone else's words. It's hard to believe I could feel those emotions. They've always been in you. It's just that you kept your distance from people to avoid getting hurt. You really have changed. Do you think so? Totally different from when I first met you! I'm certain... Natsuko has had an influence. What? You're polar opposites. Natsuko works her way into people, always wanting to be special. But you put up a barrier, avoiding relationships to maintain a normality. Therefore it was hard for you to confront work and other people. But the more you got involved with Natsuko, little by little... An evening primrose. What? If Natsuko is a sunflower, I'm an evening primrose. I think you're the sunflower. You do? You're the sunflower, and Natsuko is the sun. Sunflowers bloom beautifully thanks to the sun's light. That means if Natsuko wasn't around I couldn't survive! But, when we look at the sun we don't feel that it's struggling, but a sunflower turning its face up to the sky, is fighting to live. Hey. Do you plant seeds for that every year? Nope. Really? I guess it grew from those seeds I planted that time... This OK with you? Buying this for Koichi. You say you never have money. It was cheap. I thought it would look good on him. Hi, Koichi! It's your birthday soon. I brought a present. I don't need it. It's too late. Koichi. Stop trying to be my mom again! As long as he's healthy. I'll get going. Shunsuke! I know you're in there. Open up! Shunsuke! So you are here. Are you drunk? Let's have a night cap. Whoa, whoa. Now's no good. - Shunsuke! - It's nothing! Who's that? Didn't that lawyer tell you? I'm getting married. I'm finished with paintings. And you- What the hell! You said to do it. But you sold it, right? Hey! Wait a second. Who's that? Um, well... I don't know. Hey... Who said you could use those? Who said you could?! Those are my slippers! This kitchen mat, too! It's all mine! Mine, mine! My Chair! My oven mitts! My vase. I bought it all for Shunsuke! What's wrong with this lady? You should know... I'm seeing Shunsuke. Long before you came along! No idea what she's on about. She's got mental issues. Look. I'm asking nicely for you to leave. Ma'am. You're mine! What do you see in him? You heard he's getting married. Stop this disgraceful behavior. Just shut up! I don't wanna be a dried up woman like you! I don't give up so easily. What's up? I was going to call first... Bad time? Oh... You should've said. Sorry to bother you. Tetsuko. Next time... make sure it doesn't fail. "Keiichiro Hashimoto" You think I'd accept this?! It doesn't make any sense. Me splitting my inheritance with that woman. Nonetheless, this is your father's last will and testament. He was completely deceived by her. Taking advantage of the weak. That gold digger was after his money. Natsuko visited the hospital every day and took care of your father. Would she really go that far just for money? He asked her to stop the respirator if he couldn't breathe. You were there, too. That's... I know she killed him. And her accomplice to that murder might be her own lawyer. "Miyuki Oya: Paid Vacation" - Leave it to us. - We'll come to you again. - Thank you very much. - Thank goodness. You here, Tetsu?! Oh, hi! Get this! He wants money for his hospital bill and emotional distress. I couldn't believe it! It was just a scratch. Oh, and what did Kei's son say? There's the Shima case, too. Can you clear it all up for me? Huh? Are you still angry about the other day? Enough of this... I said enough of this! Have some consideration for me. I didn't become a lawyer to clean up your mess! All of a sudden- I can't take you anymore. Being with you makes me worse! I'm scorned by others. I hate myself! Tell me straight. You put Mr. Hashimoto out of his misery, didn't you? How dare you! Stop. Stop this! Both of you, stop! What did you say?! Don't talk shit to me! The two of you! You bitch! Just calm down! Let go! I said let go! You're doing it again! Give me that! - Give it back! - No way! I'll never forgive you! Neither will I! I didn't kill him! Why would I do that?! Why didn't you go to his funeral?! Because it was better if I didn't! I... asked Kei what the ten best things in his life were. And you know what? Most of them were about his son. I wasn't even on the list. Well... it doesn't matter. I'll find another old man about to croak. You're like a god of death. A god of death, is still a god... How long are you gonna rest? Don't rush me. Whose fault is it my leg's in pain? After 40 it takes longer to heal up. Hey... Wanna go to a wedding? Huh? Shunsuke and his girl. She's from a good family, right? Thank you. - What for? - I wanna ruin it. I can't let him get away with everything. Hey, Tetsu. Help me out! I can't do it alone. Gimme a break. It's a crazy idea. I hate buses. People being carted along. Awful, isn't it? I kind of get it. Up we go. The more I'm with you, the more rotten a woman I become. What do you mean? You were always a rotten woman. Tetsu. Tetsu! Wait up. Ouch. My leg. Hello? Any news, Isozaki? What? Please, take a look at her face. I knew Miyuki was battling an illness... but she said she was OK... Medication kept her going for a long time, but she could've collapsed at any moment. Miyuki... told us not to tell you. He truly did love me. Then suddenly wanted a divorce. He always made me feel important. He never forgot our anniversary even once. Are you all right? She has no intention of divorcing, but I'd like to give it more time and speak to her again. Understood. Do your best. I will. It should be soy sauce, Dummy. But then I tried it... It was delicious. Tonkatsu sauce was great, I thought. After that I'd always pour tonkatsu sauce on meat buns. Pathetic... When I only have a little time left, I realize how important you were. I'm so sorry. It's too late... but I hope you always keep your kind face. By the time you see this I 'II just be ashes. But my memories of you will never burn away. They're inside of me and I'll cherish them forever. Gratitude like that makes being a lawyer really worth it. What you're doing is all for others. Work steadily, don't cut corners, do what's expected of you. And never give up. Then you'll gain experience. As a result, you might be able to help someone, and they may be grateful. But receiving gratitude isn't the goal, and you shouldn't expect it. You can't believe you'll "save" people. It's the first time you're passing on that wisdom. Is it? Don't worry. Virgos are perfectionists. Well suited to working steadily without cutting corners. Didn't you once say the exact opposite? Did I? Let me in! Very sorry, but will you please go home? Why should I? I just want to talk to him. The ceremony is in progress. Don't cause trouble! Big deal. Let me in anyway. Boss! - The wedding cake fell over! - What the...! I'm sorry. Do something! Ah, hell! Get out, or we'll call the cops. Calm down, Boss. You giving up? Tetsu! It's you! Wait a sec. No way! It's not like that! I was looking for you and ran into the cake guy, then it fell. Natsu, wait. This way? That way? We might be able to pay Shima back in full! The perfect couple. She's so cute. Thank you. And now, we'd like to show you a video on the love story between groom Shunsuke and his bride Marina. Please return to- Look... I'm getting married. So I'm saying back off. Got it? This is my big chance. She's from a good family. What is this? It's nothing, don't worry. No way I'm letting this cash cow go because of that bitch. You from the hotel, stop the video! Eto, make it stop! I'll explain it all later. I said stop it! You there! Marina, are you all right? Shunsuke, what is the meaning of all this? I'll explain everything, I promise. The video you've just seen shows Shunsuke Ota speaking to the lawyer who represents me. Stop the bitch! Just listen for a minute! It's my fault. Because I fell in love with Shunsuke. Even though he only got close to me to have me commit fraud. Somebody! - What the hell is this? - You tell me! Let me confess to all of you. I... sold a fake painting for an exorbitant price. I just didn't want him to hate me. I came here today to help you. He doesn't love you. He's just after your family fortune. Don't be betrayed by him. You're still young. You can start over! Don't end up bruised and broken like me! Marina... Don't listen to her. She has mental problems. You believe me, right? And now, please allow me to sing a song in dedication to Marina, and myself. "You're the strong one who doesn't shed tears" "So who is it that made you so sad?" "Stop clinging to a love that's already done" "and just start over from square one" "If you want to be happy" "Then a better tomorrow is easy to find" "Miyuki Oya" Dear Tetsuko, I'm writing you from the hospital. This is the first time I've written a letter to you like this. We talked about so many things. You anticipate what's coming ahead, you're a tough negotiator, and a superior attorney. Your cool exterior might cause misunderstanding, but that will clear up one day. You're not cold toward people, you just don't expect much from them, right? To me, that part of you is cool. And so, that makes me very proud of you. Tetsuko... the fears and sadness you carry with you, are not unique to you, but something everyone feels inside. Because every one of us lives with that, you should also live like you're OK with it, too. Next time you feel stressed or depressed, I won't be able to ask "Are you all right?" but it's not necessary. That's because I know you'll be OK, Tetsuko... It's open. Tetsu. What are you doing? You're crying? Never mind. What do you mean never mind? Stop all that. Crying will give you wrinkles. How? How do you always stay so positive? "If you want to be happy" "Then a better tomorrow is easy to find" I get it! Thanks for today. I feel like a new woman because of you. Here's a little something. That's not necessary. It's for everything you've done. Call it "legal fees". Coming in? No, I'm heading to Osaka. Osaka? An acquaintance asked if I was interested in the vegetable business. It sounds like a good chance. If you need legal assistance, don't hesitate. You rotten woman! Time for me to go. I'll do my best. You, too! You don't need to tell me.
