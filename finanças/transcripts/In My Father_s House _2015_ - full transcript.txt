Dear dad, it's been 15 years since we last met. I doubt if you could imagine what I look like today, but I remember your face as clearly as the dream I had of you last night. I wonder if my dad, if he's heard of me. Like, I wonder if he knows that, like, I'm Rhymefest. Hey, y'all make some noise for my man, Rhymefest! I don't like it unless it's You might see me in my whip with my He's from Chicago, you might not know that he won a, uh, Grammy for co-writing "Jesus Walks", the Kanye West song. Rhymefest... I walked through the valley Of the shadow of death is Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless Dad, I needed you in my life. Where were you? Did your father abandon you? Or had you forgotten that I'd even existed? I want legacy. I owe that to my children so that they can have legacy. I want to give him all the things I ain't have, you know what I'm saying. I didn't have a pop to discipline me. I was just off the chain automatically. I hate this. You look cute. No, I don't. Aww... Oh, yeah, we can hang this one up. Solomon was chunky. He was so chubby. Hmm. Ow. Very good. Thank you. This is my wife, Donnie. The angel who came in and saved my life, and we finally moved into our new home. I grew up with my mom. When my mother had me, you know, she was 15 years old. It was like a child raising a child. My grandparents took over. So, I was going back and forth between my mother and my grandparents. Basically I met my pops maybe three times. Three or four times in my whole life. And the last time I saw my father, I had to be, like, maybe 12 years old. And he wasn't a fresh dude like alcoholic, drug addict, you know what I'm saying. And I just never saw him again. He faded to black, you know. And my wife and I were looking for a home to purchase. And I rode past the house that my father grew up in and it was for sale. And the way my wife looks at it, is like, it's an inheritance, you know, like, something that was owed to me for my pops never being around. And hopefully, my children can have the memories in this crib that I never had, you know? This house right here, where my man is. People need to know where they come from. I think that's so important. It's almost like putting a puzzle together, exploring the past and trying to find some resolution. When I was young, the few times I met my father, this was his room. And all I can remember is him watching George Clinton videos, drinking beer. And now it's mine. I only met my father a few times during my conscious years. There was a time he came over to my mom's house to take me to a movie, and I can hear him talking to my mom in the other room. He didn't have any money. And he had to borrow money from her to take me to the movie. And he had blood on his pants. But none of that mattered, you know what, that day I was just happy to be around him. Around another man. Give it up for Rhymefest! I know I did good without my father. I got that two million dollar record deal. I got a chance to travel the world, win Grammys, have fans all around the country. But there's the emptiness. There's still an emptiness. - Babe, I'm about to go. - All right, I'm ready. When we first moved in, for Che, it just brought up all of these feelings about not growing up with his father. So many negative things that had happened. He just had all these questions. What kind of man was he? And why did he abandon me? And so, finally I just said you have a lot of questions. I think that you probably should try to find him. Hey! Hey, Mom, how was church? It's all good. But, you know what's funny though, now that I, like, got this house? I be feeling like something is telling me to go find my father. Do you care? But how do I know he ain't dead yet? Mm-hmm. So, Trenton is Brian's brother? Yeah. Give me his phone number, and I'm going to call him. Okay. Hello? Trenton. I'm good, Unc. You know, I bought the house right? Yeah, and I want to find Brian. Do you know where he is? Well... Tom Willoughby? Yes? How you doing Mr. Willoughby? Yeah, I assume you got my message. Yeah, how is he doing? What is his state? Mm-hmm. Okay, lock my number in and thank you so much Mr. Willoughby. No problem. In three, two... Hold on, hold on, hold on. Have you ever met your grandfather before? I have never met my grandfather. What do you think meeting your grandfather will be like for the first time? I, I don't... I don't know. I don't know. I don't really feel any connection because he hasn't really been in my life. Today, I got a phone call from Tom Willoughby. He was like, I got your father. And before I knew it, he just threw Brian on the phone. And it's funny 'cause I don't know whether or not to call him Brian or like what to call him. I really don't feel like saying, like- like saying Dad is, like, um, a term of endearment. And I don't know how endeared I am at this point. I mean he had this thing in his voice where he was like, I'ma be here at this library until 7:00. He's like please, please meet me, like, please don't not come. And then I start questioning was this a mistake? 'Cause I might not even like this dude. What do you hope to accomplish today? Seeing what I could be. I mean at the end of the day... I'm a... I'm... if I'm going to be honest, I'm a piece of him. You know I'm a- I'm a piece of him. And maybe part of why I'm here is to maybe even turn that around for him. Because maybe that means something for me in the future. Don't you know who this is, don't you? Don't you know who this is? This is, this is my main man, my son. This is Rhymefest. What's up man? Come on, come on with me, man. Oh, come here. Can he come with me? Yeah, come on. I'm going crazy, man. What's wrong with you? I can't get over this. Come on. That's your what? Let's go, let's go eat man, hop in. You good? I'm happy, Che. All right. Did you know me when you saw me? I almost didn't, I almost didn't. Or did it take you a minute? I almost did not recognize you but then, guess what. What? You had my walk, you had my walk. You got a walk? Yes, I got a walk. Even with a limp. Let me ask you a question. What's up? Do you got any more kids? Or am I the only one? No, that's what I knew... I knew that was going to be the first one. You the only one. Che, you the only one. You is the only son I have. This is the restaurant right there, across the street. Yeah, right there... So how you feeling, man? Che... Tell me how you feel right now. I'm nervous! Why? That's true to the point. Why you nervous, man? Man... It's all good. You-you-you is a billionaire, man. I ain't no billionaire. Call-call on up. I did, she didn't answer the phone. I want to see what she look like now. I can show you a couple pictures. That was my boo. That's your grandson. Oh, no! That's what my mother look like now. She didn't got fat?! No, she ain't fat. That was the best girl I ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever had. Now what do you want right now, in your life? If your man... if you could have anything in the world, what would you want right now? A nice job and a- and a nice crib. I don't want to work outside. I want an inside job, run an elevator. They don't do that no more, man. Run an elevator? Something simple, right? I want to push the button on the elevator. Because that's all I can do. Before you take me home... Which store? The what? Don't buy no liquor with that, man. Listen, I ain't buying, I'm just buying me, I'm buying, I'm buying... I'll take you straight to the spot. Oh, man. We ain't going to the liquor store, man. I ain't gonna have no sleep tonight. I love you, man, but damn. You hurting me man, you hurting me. I could buy me one doggone thing before I go in tonight. At least a pint of something. Oh, man, you gonna do me like... You going to make this... Do one night, one night without it. All right, one night. One night. All right, make a left. For me. All right, all right, all right. Can you do it? I can do it. Be good, man. All right, all right, man. Stay out of trouble. You stay up, man. Don't do nothing wrong, man. I'm going to see you this Thursday. I'll see you this Thursday. This Thursday, this Thursday, we gon'... hey. We'll get haircuts together. Yeah. Okay, okay, I got you. All right. I got you. Take it easy man, good to meet you. Brother. I actually like the dude. Like, I want to go wash my hands, take a shower. But, that's just the asshole in me talking. I can't be mad. Like, he fell on hard times. I mean, sometimes it ain't nobody's fault. It's just life. Now, he waiting. I think that the night went a lot better than I would have anticipated. Like I'm just excited about, for both of us, being able to experience a healthy family. Because Che and I, we had very similar childhoods. Both of our mothers, you know, had drug problems. And both of our fathers had basically abandoned us. I think that African-American culture can be very secretive when it comes to some of our life experiences. There's a lot of hurt and pain. And I want my life to kind of be an open book. This is an article that talked about me and my mom. Um, it was about parents being incarcerated. My mom was in prison from the time I was four to about ten or 11 for armed robbery. She was a getaway driver. The closest person to me was my grandmother. Because when my mom went to prison, no one including my father, would take me. And if it hadn't been for my grandmother, I would have been in foster care. And that's why I've always wanted to be a mom. It's like a chance to do different and to do better. I don't have any children. I have stepchildren. But I'm ready to take the next step to have a baby. It's my legacy with Che. I think in order to break a cycle, you have to deal with the pain of whatever trauma that you've been through. Oh, boy. What? This brings back memories. What does? Look at the house. Where? Right there. Let's go in. What?! Let's go in. Go in? That's my house. That's what?! I bought the house. You bought the house?! No. I bought the house, it's my house now. You couldn't have. Come on, man, stop it, man. There where I grew up. It's my new house. Get the heck out of here. Come here, walk in. Open the door, oh, no, open the door. Oh, man. How you doing? Alright, alright. Good to see you. What's up, what's up, big guy? Hey, do you know me? You know who I am. It can't be Lorna? That you, Lorna? Yeah, it's me. No! Yeah. It's you? It's me. Oh! What's up, Brian? Oh, man, what the heck. Hey, give me your hat and coat, man. Ooh, man. You want to stay for dinner? Yes, sir. Oh, you shocking me. Oh, okay. I wouldn't have recognized you. I wouldn't have recognized you either. Because we was teenagers. Yes, yes we were. Teenagers. Back in the day. Back in the day, a long time ago. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Hey man you want to leave my mom alone and get ready to eat. Stop eyeing my mama. And in all places, this house. Uh-huh. What the heck. Come on, let me show you. You want to see the basement? Yeah, I got to see the basement. Hey, hey, hey, watch that. Watch out, hey, come on this way, man. Oh, man! Yes, sir. This gon', this gon' be a library. This gon' be a... This used to a bedroom. This used to be my little brother's. This is all the people that I've been hanging with and know. And this is me and Kanye. And me and Chuck D from Public Enemy, you know? Man, man! This is me and the president of England. The president of England? Yeah, the Prime Minister of England. Man. That's when I ran for office. That was my sign. Doggone it, man, man. You look good with a haircut man. Thank you. I'm so glad to see both of y'all. I don't know what I'd do. It's a miracle, it's a miracle. It's a blessing. I never thought this would happen. Yeah, they still out there, cold. All right, I'll pull over up there. Yeah, see where all the people at? Yeah, they gonna call me again. Hey, man, you be good, be safe. All right, man. You gon' walk me to the door, make sure. Make sure everything all right. Hey, did y'all do the recall yet? Can I get my name back on the list? Doing the wait list right now. Back up and give us some room. All right. Hey. All right, man. Take it easy. All right, man. Y'all stay up. All right, man, y'all stay up, y'all stay up, people. I heard my father say something earlier when I was coming down the stairs, and he said, "Man, the only thing I did right was Che. I didn't think I could do anything right." Like, and I did that right. I want my dad in my life. But I grew up with addicts, and I know how addicts can tear a home apart. So now he's got a chance. He's got to make this happen. This is your life Yo look at here These the things we all go through It's everyday life for me and you Don't feel bad Don't feel bad. Can you get in the car? Come on. Things that happen every day Around the world or around the way We just tell a story Tell the story... Good afternoon, Chicago. This is Che Rhymefest Smith on the "Speak Up" show, WVON. I want to talk to you about something today that has been heavy on my mind. I'm looking at news stories all week. You know black men getting shot. Yesterday, nine-year-old boy killed in our city, and I started to think where does fathering come in? We got Jimmy on the line. What do you think, Jimmy? It's just one of those things that we have to ask ourselves on a personal level, what are we doing to help our community? Mm-hmm. I mean if we don't fight for our own, then nothing can help us. You know, when we look at violence, when we look at incarceration. We've got young people, they don't have a father, they don't have a mother, and in fact, when you look at many gangs, that's why young people join them, because they believe this is the support system. So, we have to be better role models. We have to be even more than mentors. We have to be the fathers and the mothers of the children who don't have them at home. Thank you for tuning into the "Speak Up" show. This is Che Rhymefest Smith signing out. What up, brotha? Rhymefest! Oh, shit! What's up, baby? Man, how you feeling, man? Welcome to the Chi, baby. I live up the block. Hey, what you doin' out here, man? Turnin' up the positive movement, man. I love that in you, bro. Alright. Alright, take it easy. What up, what up, what up, what up, man? Hey, how y'all's doin'? Growing up in Chicago, I was that kid hangin' out on the corner. Gangbanging, with no purpose. I felt like a failure because I didn't have a father. This is backwards I'm not supposed to be the man of the house It's not like she tried to trap you You played by the mouse... When you become a teenager and you realize that none of your friends have fathers around, You become angry. The fatherless How does it feel to be kidless? Mmm. Thank you. Welcome to the strip of death Where you see the reaper at his best Black hood is strapped up with his TEC 'Cause I'm lost got nothing to lose So I mapped out my best move I'll put you on your knees while my guys grab everything 911 emergency Hurry before they bury me because I can't sleep There's something wrong with me Let me ask you a question. What is that about? It's about basically, this is what is it's come to. Robbing somebody and maybe taking their life. Your daddy died when you was young. Your brother just died, right? Yeah. I ain't heard that story. It's sitting in there. That's your most profound rap sitting inside of you. And you're talking about killing somebody else. It's hard. You see all these people right here. When we ain't here, we- we-we your family. Ain't we family? Yes, sir. We gon' take care of each other. You always got somebody to call in here. It's just like growing up with no parents, you don't really know who you are some days. It's like you don't know... you don't know who you get this from. You don't know who you get that from. And then it's just like I keep losing people. Everybody around you is dropping and you got to beat whatever that is. You got to be the leader that leads your family out of that. You gotta conquer whatever that is man. Do you got somebody to talk to? Who you got to talk to? Nobody. You got a phone? Put my number in your phone. We gon' talk, alright? But you could call me whenever, man. Stay consistent. One thing I realized today is that everybody has a story. And my personal experiences are not unique. 75% of black children are born into single parent homes. 75%. That's crazy. But we have the same goal finding out who we are. Do you think me and you look alike? Well, I think we do. You got-you got my eyes, bro. I got to give you that. You got my eyes. Did you like your father? Yeah, but he crazy. He was kind of abusive. Like beat on you? Yeah. It was like a torture chamber. You're a very emotional guy. You're a sensitive man. Yes, I am, very sensitive. I be watching "Little House on the Prairie", man, a lot. Mm-hmm. That gets to me, you know? That's the kind of guy I wanna be like, you know. I just... I just wish you were there more man, when I was growing up, you know? I wish I was there more, too. But Che... I really wasn't grown up, man. I really wasn't. We got to get you a place to stay. You got-you got to get off the street. Yeah. Well, that's what I'd like to do. And I'm doing... But you gotta, you gotta stop drinking. I got to what? You got to stop drinking. Whoa, now... You telling a bird not to fly. You tell a fish not to swim. I mean, I've been doing this for so long. How can you change now? You know? Shit. So what you do is you open it up. You put the clothes in here. Okay. After you put the clothes in here. It's gel packs right here. Uh-huh. Put the gel packs in there. Power and then start. Power and then start. Okay, got it, thank you. See you later, man. Alright, right on, right on. Alright, alright, okay. So many messed up clothes. Okay, I know I got to wash that. Well, I haven't been doing this for a long time. I want to see my father I think I got to save him Yep, I already love him, I already forgave him I do my thing, I save the children I'm like a hero running into burning buildings Except I'm running into shelters To save people who are related they my elders There he is right there. Hey, man! What's up, man? We have an appointment today 'cause he's supposed to be going to a transitional home. Yeah. You're going to go around that way, sign your name over here. Yes, sir. Oh, oh, oh, oh. I got it, I got it. Man, come on man. You're going up the steps, man. You gimme that bag. Give it here. Don't that feel better? Man, it feels great. So basically, they said that they're going to give him a shower. They going to do some things to make sure you don't have no bed bugs or stuff like that. And, um, they're going to keep you. Yeah, they gonna... How you feel about that? Well... It's cold out here so it better than being outside in the cold. When you get settled, you got a phone. Charge your phone. And make sure you call me, man. All right. They ain't going to keep you prisoner. Well, I hope not! It's for all my blue collar niggas in the Midwest Going through our struggle We know things could be better And we just want a little more No matter how much I get I want more Even when I talk my shit I want more Every party on every list And everybody want a life like this And I ain't going for the oki-doke you owe me dough You better pay me like you know we broke This industry be trying to strangle niggas in the choke You think these rappers rich These niggas out here selling dope You think it's crazy like more No matter how much I get I want more Even when I talk my shit I want more Hello, I'm a little baby! I don't really do things, and I move side to side. And I can't control my neck right now. And my fingers like to throw up gang signs. Throw up a gang sign. Pow! Look at that, look at that... folks. Ha! That's my baby girl. See all these years of being a womanizer, and you see what happens? You see what happens? When men become womanizers, they have little women. And I got to chill out. I got to chill out and show you the game. When I first got my record deal, I became selfish. I forgot about Solomon, I forgot about Essence. I had to go off and be Rhymefest. I was 29. And I was going through this thing where I felt like I was getting old. I tried to fuck everything. I did fuck everything. Rhymefest! Everything that I worked for in my life was to not be like my father. I mean when Solomon's mom got pregnant, I was like, "I'm gonna be different "than the father I had. I'm going to be the greatest father." Say, "Mama." But, boy how the universe works. Hello? Hey, what's up? So what's, what's all of this you telling me about, like, you know, when I'm done. The text message you just sent me. "What are your intentions on raising Amina?" And it's just like... Hold on, but why... But, Joli, Joli, Joli. Number one, we have to get a DNA test. I... that-that's something that you don't feel is important. You describe it as... No, I don't, because I'm looking at... Joli. Joli, you got a brand-new ba... Please leave your message for... Joli. Joli is a woman that I was dating right before I met Donnie. And when Joli got pregnant, I was going through struggles, I was poor. I didn't want a baby. You know, and I told her, I said, you had this baby. This baby is going to be fatherless. You're going to go through this alone. But she had the child anyway. And so, for the first year, I wasn't there. But I called her and I said, okay, I'm going to do better. Try to come see the baby. You know, I had to explain it to my wife. Because during this year and nine months I got married to Donnie. But, I found out some things that made me not trust when she even said it was my child. Like Amina doesn't look like me. And she doesn't move like me or act like me. I mean, when I look at Essence, when I look at Solomon, I see myself, I feel myself. But when I look at Amina, I don't see me. But I'll tell you since I reunited with my father, I'm trying to do things differently, and I need to know, is she mine? Good morning, everybody. We're going to start this morning with our earth science. And if you will turn to page 239. Do you have it, Brian? No, not yet. Page 239. The earth science area is very, very enriching. And it is about rocks and mountains. And we're going to be talking about the oceans of the world and meteorology. I know you've noticed on television that they are meteorologists... Hey, Che, how are ya? Good, good. I want to talk to you about my father. Health-wise, he's in good shape. Mentally, he seems to be coming out of the fog and he's sharper. He just finished, uh, GED class so, uh, he knows that the next step he's closer to getting that job. He's really looking forward to finally being in his own little one-bedroom apartment. He is. He really wants that so... He really wants that. Coming from 20 years being homeless and being on the streets, it is overwhelming, but he's eager to get back to work. Yep. When I come around him, he doesn't smell like alcohol. I know the difference of when he's been drinking and when he hasn't. Something's motivating him. Mm-hmm. Come in! Hello, Brian... I brought you some stuff, man. Oh, man. Now, which bed is yours? That's my bed here, man. Okay, okay. Hey, man, where, where'd you get this here from? Somebody stole your mug. Yes, they did, they stole... Oh, man, this is better than the mug that they took, man. Yeah. And you can't have that without something to drink. So I brought you some of these. Now this ain't Hawaiian Punch, but... Oh, hey, man, that's just as good. Deodorant, soap. Oh, man, man, thank you, son. Always. Oh, man, I just got me a-a CD yesterday. That's from the damn '90s, man! Don't nobody use that no more. It only cost me, it only cost me $3. Three... that's why, because nobody use it. I want to throw that shit out the window, man. Don't do it! Where are we going, man? Well, I was thinking this. Me and you play chess, eat lunch. Yeah, let's do that. All right. Man, I been wanting to play you for the longest, man. Let's get it. You been avoiding me. You've been avoiding me! Ain't no more avoiding. When was the last time you beat me, man? Today. Yee! Scaring me, man. Don't be scared, just be ready. I gotta be focused. Let's see what happens when you focus. Oh, no, no. I got to take that. Holy! I learned how to play chess at an early age. And that's my favorite game, chess. Out of check. Chess is like life. It's like you the king and whatnot. And every piece on that chessboard is supposed to protect the king. Every piece. I ain't gonna play with you. And every piece is your family. Your family can help you or your family can kill you. But, uh, I'm defending myself at the same time. I'm protecting myself at all costs. Straight out of high school we didn't know what to do Wanted to go to college but no money was nothing new Wanted to get away go see the world and do something new... Hey, do you think I'm famous? Yeah! Like, when my album first came out, I couldn't go nowhere, man. Oh, man. Now see, that's why... That's why I got that CD. I know you got some, some, some of your first, uh, rapping things and whatnot. I want to hear, I want to be able to hold on one of your CDs. Man, you're not even going to understand what I'm talking about. I want to be able to sing the song just like you do. I want to play that thing over and over and over and over and over and over. Until I say I don't want to hear no more, you know. That's what I done did. "Blue Collar", aye? That was the name of my first album. This, like, all the crowds, all the people I performed for. And that's me and Eminem battling. Yeah, yeah I seen this one. Rhymefest... You know who that is? Kanye West. I've known Kanye since I was like 16, 17. ...throw them up in the air Let them all come down... right there... I met Kanye because he came up to me and was like, yo, you one of the top rappers in the city. The one thing you're missing is tracks. You need beats and I got tracks and I got beats. Kanye to the unh West Said you from the outfit I told her yes And I tell my friends about him, and I be like, there's this really arrogant dude named Kanye. And he's crazy and he's... And Kanye heard that I was talking mess about him. And he came over my house, he called me one day. He said, "Yo, I'm going to come pick you up, let's go out and kick it." And we have like the best time. Went girl hunting, and laughed and rapped and all of this. And when he dropped me off, he said, you know, "We picked you up 'cause we were gonna jump you and beat you up, "and leave you somewhere. But, like, you're actually a cool dude." We've been friends like brothers ever since. Somebody had gave me a tape. And the tape had this gospel song on it. And it was, like, Jesus walks Jesus walks with me, with me It really shook me up. Brought me to tears. And I said Kanye, I called him up. I said you gotta hear this song. Jesus Walks... He said, "Oh, my God." Because the devil trying to break me down... We must write this immediately. Harass and arrest us Saying we eat pieces of shit like you For breakfast unh Y'all eat pieces of shit... He said, I want you to know this is for my album. But, I'm going to give you credit on it. And we're going to write it together. 'Cause it was originally for my demo for me to get a record deal. Kanye West. It was up for Best Rap Song of the Year. And everybody who helped write the rap song gets a Grammy. And I was like yo, it's dope, dope. Yo, this is Rhymefest. Right now you need to drop what you're doing. Punch out and go clock my new album. "Blue Collar." Time magazine named this album of the six summer albums to play nice and loud with the song "Fever" from his debut CD. Rhymefest! ...Stuffy head cold leaving you aching... I put out Blue Collar July of 2006. Rhymefest coming through Jimmy Kimmel next time let me sit on the couch yo It was highly anticipated. Fever Put your hands in the sky Fever And we came out with the album, and it bombed. It... it bombed. This is the story of a comeback Know a lot of haters don't want that Now I don't act I overreact That is the shit they wanted me back In the streets... tell 'em. Don't tell 'em... Tell 'em... Hey, what's up. I was returning your phone call from the other day. Yeah, uh, do I have court Friday? 'Cause, you know, I paid last month. But when it went up, like it had kind of made me fall behind in child support. So right now, I'm a, I'm a month behind. But, I'm going to catch that up pretty soon. All right, well, thank you for your help, goodbye. Bye, Che. You know, people ask what happened to all your money. Where is all your money? When these record labels give you a check, the one thing they don't give you is... and a lot of rappers and young guys from the hood never had, was financial training. You know what I mean? I bought houses that got foreclosed on. I bought cars. You know, I invested in my career. You know, there were times when there was no record label. I had to press up CDs and give them away. Pay to go on tours and you know, try to get things restarted. And I had to keep up that reputation that nothing's wrong, everything is good. I got it. That's a part of being a man. This is Che Rhymefest Smith filling in for Matt McGill. And it is truly a family affair as we discuss black fatherhood. And in this discussion with me, I got my father and my son. Three generations of black men. We're going to go to a caller on the South side. David, you have a quick... You there, David? Yeah, how you doing Rhymefest? I'm a first generation father because my father, I consider him a bum because he didn't do what he needed to do as a man to raise his child. I'm not trying to put your father on the spot, but I would like to ask him, what does it take for a man to walk away from his child? It-it wasn't not meant for me to do that. The thing was things was hard, and David, I'm sorry that your... father, you know, didn't come through for you but you know what? You need to go see him and find him like my son found me. I just want to say to David, you can never have a proper relationship with your children until you learn to forgive. I want to take another caller, let's go to Faheem. God meant for boys to have fathers. Boys need fathers. Father knows best. My father was an alcoholic but he was still there for his family. And that's why I'm making that statement. We need our men in our lives. There are no excuses for any man to abandon their children. If you can survive on the street and homeless, then you could have survived with your children. See, you knew your dad, man. You spent time with him. You grew up with him, bad good, whatever the times was. Y'all have. But see, if you'd seen how my dad was, man... He wasn't a pretty picture. Why? Some things he... you know done to me man, I wouldn't do to my enemy. Man, he put, he put, you know, shotguns to your head. Not his kids? Oh, yeah. Over what? About 45 cents was missing out of his pockets and whatnot. And he don't know what happen... 45 cents? 45 cents. Oh, man. Back in the days we used to have to hang from these pipes and whatnot. All night long. That was your punishment? That was my punishment. How could you love somebody like that, man. There you go, tell me that. You tell me that. Yeah. Daddy. Hey, boo. Hey, hey. You know who this is? This my dad, this my dad. Grandpa! Yeah, I go to school. What kind of fish you want? Uh, get me catfish. I didn't know you like catfish. I love catfish, too. You do, you gonna have some catfish with me? Uh-huh. I see. If this is true, that like he gets a GED, he stops drinking, it's the most amazing thing I've ever seen, like that I never expected. And-and, man I got a father. Like a real father. I don't think we've officially met. My name is Judith Ball, Center for Workforce Development. Um, Kevin was kind enough to give me your resume, so can you just answer a couple of these questions - for me real quick? - Sure, sure will. What's your date of birth? 11-24-58. Are you a veteran, sir? No. And do you have a driver's license? No. When was the last time that you had a job interview? Well, I... I mean, I've been out of a job for about 20 years. Right, so you didn't get a lot of interview chances, huh? No, I didn't get... I didn't have too many chances. Do you have a criminal background of any kind? No, no criminal... You've never been in trouble? I've been in trouble, but I don't have no criminal background. I never been convicted of any crime. Okay. So how much clean time do you have right now? Clean time? Well, uh, from this day to here. So, you got about two... 2-1/2 months. Right. Okay, that's great! It's like, you know, I'm still dreaming. Right. - Have a great day. - All right, you too. I've been here two months man, ooh-wee. It only seem like about two weeks. I ain't drinking. I'm clearing up, my skin is clearing up. I'm gaining weight. Man, if I go around people that, you know, that I hang around, they wouldn't even recognize me. They'd say... "Brian is that you?!" Man, they say... you looking better and better every day. Every day you looking better and better. I say and you could, too. All you got to do is follow the rules. Man, it's hard, but this is the thing that gets me along from not drinking. You know, I fill this up with with pop. And... hey, I'm cool. I'm straight. I'm going to pick up my boy, Wayne. One of my best friends. Me and him, you know, we-we- we hanged out a long, long... It's like, we like Laurel and Hardy. Right there. Hey, buzz buzzin! Man, you can't be doing that shit, man, damn. You fucking me up, man. Shit. If I hadn't known you been like this here man, damn. Hey, man! Hey, hold on, hold on, hold on. Don't come in here, man. I got to check what's in that cup first. All right. It's agua. You in here. It's agua. Come on, man, don't be scared. Come on, man. Come to your buddy's crib. How you feelin', man? Hey, do me a favor. Uh, go back and wash your hands so we can get ready to eat, y'all. Yeah, yeah. Let me show you where the washroom at. Man, control yourself man. I know, you know what I... Oh man. I should have rolled them back to see how my boy Wayne was doing. How he was feeling. I didn't know he was feeling that good today. That's my boy. And I used to, I used to act like that boy back in the days. Man, that's some different day, though. What's going on with you, man? I'm just, I'm just.. What's the word I'm looking for? I don't know what the word is. What's the word you're looking for? Situation, it ain't- it ain't-it ain't... Okay, what I'm trying to say... Why you questioning me? Brian? Yes? What's up with your man? Yeah, he want to, he want to know the truth. Why nigga is tripping. Che, he's a nut, man, you know. I know he a nut from day one. Now you feel me. Now you feel me. This your best friend. This my best friend. He's confused. I'll tell you what though. What that? I'm glad you my father. Yeah, oh, man. You know what I'm talking, you know... Would you shut up. I got to get some paper towels, man. Yeah. Boy, you are lost in space, ain't you? Wasted. Yeah. Man, you, you something else, man. But, you know, I gon', you know... The first step you have to realize that you're not in control of your life anymore. Alcohol, cocaine, drugs, whatever your disease is. It's bigger than you. When you first get sober, you have this feeling of, I got this. I'm never going to go back to that lifestyle. But at the end of the day, the age that you start using marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol is the age that you stop developing mentally. I mean, that's why you see a lot of these people that are older and immature. But how is it that he's going cold turkey. And I'm concerned about that. Like he goes and hangs with the guys that he was hanging with when he was drinking and they're still homeless. And they're drinking and he says, "Well, I just pretend that my Hawaiian punch is, is the Richards, you know?" How is this working that he's not... It seems like he's a little ahead of his time on this. He hasn't gone through the ups and downs and the emotional. Yeah. Everything's calm, cool. I'm gonna get a job, I'm gonna get an apartment. Does that worry you? It's-it's... mind boggling at some point, I mean, Che. Yeah. But it can happen, it's not unheard of. I mean, maybe there's something going on deeper, peeling back the layers of the onion with him. He's got some stuff that he wants to get off his chest that he's harboring. But you can't read another person's mind. Yeah. Let me show you, let me show you. Look at my wheels out there. That's you right there? That be me, man. Aw, this nice right here, man. This up, man. Brakes are good? Yes, sir. And the gears work. So how'd you get your bike? Over there by where Wayne be at. Sold it for $15. Keep it locked up so don't nobody try to get it. Yes, sir, man, I got to. Let me get out of here before it rains, man. All right, man. Walk me to this back door, if you don't mind. I sure will. I'll make sure that they don't jump you, man. What a day, what a day. This is great, this is beautiful. Hello? And I'm scared to go outside now, you know how come? If I go outside, man, the way I'm feeling. Man, I'm, I'm ready to get my groove on, man. You get your groove on, and I think you know what happens, man. You-you lose everything. Oh, man. Everything that me and you been building, it don't mean shit if you relapse. I'm asking you not to have a drink. I will get you a bike, man, I will get you a bike. Just relax. All right, all right. Listen, man. I love you, I love you, I love you with all my heart. What's up, Craig? Hey, what's up, man. All right. They're gonna work the heck out of me today. Oh, Heavenly Father, God. We come giving you thanks. Thank you for another day's journey. Lord, I ask that you show my brother how to work unto you and restore all that has been taken away from him. Amen, amen, amen. Amen, amen. Hey, Brian, come on in. What's up, what's up? How is the housekeeping job going along? It's-it's-it's doing all right. You know, I don't have no complaints. Well, I have a surprise for you here. Since you worked, this is your... your first paycheck, Brian. Oh, it is?! Compliments of the housekeeping a Safe Haven Program. Okay. Don't spend it all today. I can't spend it all today, but I guess I'll get me a birth certificate with it. Good, that's what I want to hear. All right, so I wanted to talk. We have a copy of the Chicago police department background. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh... Okay. You had said that you had never been in trouble. I have, I've never been to prison, that's what I said. Ohh... Now see it's a lot... Okay. There's a lot of arrests on here. Oh, yeah, but do you know what it was for? Drinking. You know I can't, I can't open up a-a-a-a can of beer without going to jail, you know. There's a lot of aliases. You've used a lot of fake names when you get locked up. Well, sometimes I'm a little bubbly, you know. Who remembers their name when they're... Right. There's a robbery on here, though. A robbery? A robbery. Well, I was never convicted of it. Well, hopefully this is where it ends. The staple's in it, and hopefully this is it for the lifetime. This is it for the records. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think you're doing so good. I'm so proud of you. Oh, yeah? You're halfway there, do you realize that? You have four months sober. One foot over the halfway mark. Yeah, well, I tell ya... Don't get me... hey, I'm grateful for it. But believe me, man. A cold one would sure feel good right about now. But you know, I'm biting the bullet. You know, I'm biting the bullet, man, you know. I'm proud of you, all right? Keep it up, okay? What up, man? What's up, man? How you doing, brother? Oh, pretty good, man. Pretty good. Last time we was here. Yeah. I said, man, you gon' stop drinking, man, so you can get your thing together. You was like, no. You said, would you ask a fish not to swim? Or a bird not to fly? Yeah, I remember them words. It was like you traded one life for another one. I did, man. And you made the decision. All right, I want to be with my son. How you feeling now, man? Hey, man. Are you missing it? Yeah. I'm, yeah, I ain't gon', I'm not gonna sit up there and tell no lie, yeah, I'm missing- I'm missing my cocktail, you know. I seen my boy Wayne yesterday, you know. How was that? Man, he was toasted like a big dog. Yesterday? I don't know, maybe because of me. Maybe, 'cause I was high, I see him in a different light now. You want to get your own apartment. I'm about to, man. They said it won't be long. Hey. There's an apartment right next door to me. $400 a month. You can come over, cut my grass. Yeah. If you lived next door to me, that'd be incredible. Well, yeah. I found you I found me This is how it was supposed to be Never had a father so I blamed my mama She... she had bad karma Never had a father so I blamed my mama She made bad choices and had horrible karma She couldn't even pick a real man to have honor... The street that was my alma mater She couldn't even find a real man to have honor I got my degree from the streets that was my alma mater Call my homies my brothers Call the hustlers my cousins Call my homies my cousins. Call the hustlers 'cause the two 'H' thing is dope, too. Call my homies my cousins Call the hustlers my brothers We made our own family We were right for each other Whoo, you know what I'm saying there? Please go and tell me if you think it's weak, though. I will. I found you... You know, music for me is like a soundtrack to life. And as my life evolves, so does that soundtrack. That's why my newer stuff is coming from a different place. Very intimate, not so angry. Because of what I've learned, how I've matured, like I'm growing up. It's easy to make them and it's hard to raise them Why did Daddy leave who created the mayhem Don't even matter no more I already forgave him I got kids of my own and I currently raise them So you think you're pregnant? Yes, I do. Is that the pee pee dance? Now, you're going to make me go. This is Donnie doing the pee pee dance. To come out and do the baby dance. I'll be out in a moment. Can I come in? No, not with your camera. Where is the thing at? It's on the thing over there. Right here? Yeah. If it's pregnant what will it say? Pregnant. And if it's not pregnant what will it say? Not pregnant. It's says you're not pregnant. Oh, all right. Let me turn this off. This is the baby book that covers my first pregnancy that lasted five months. I asked the Lord to please take control of my womb, help me to be fertile, ripen my eggs, and create inside of me an environment that will safely and healthily house a child. Donnie and I are trying to have a baby, which will be her first and potentially my fourth. The doctor told her she'd never have a baby. So, Donnie had an operation where she's able to carry a baby to term. You got a big hump right here. I want to do things different with Donnie, like this woman is my chance to not mess it up. To have this baby intentionally, it makes me feel like I'm doing it right for the first time, in 35 years. How do you feel now? Like, do you feel inside, in your spirit and soul, like "Yo, I can have a baby now?" I do, I do. Although, I do feel like until I pass the period where we lost the first baby, I'm going to be nervous, you know? Mm-hmm. So... We'll see what happens. I'm going to have a totally normal pregnancy. Yes. Oh... shot. Man. A lot of work. Can't go nowhere without my trusted thing here. Aw, shit. What? Yeah, man. It's move in time. It's time to head for the hills. Take care of yourself. Oh, I'm going to try, man. I'm going to do the best. I see... I... you know what? I ain't never had an apartment where I had to sign for a lease. Really? What'd you do with your other apartments? I rent out a room. Mm-hmm. Now that's another thing. I don't know no soup kitchens around 79th street. Well, you ain't going to need none. Oh, well, I'm used to the streets, man. That's the thing, man. Like you not in the streets no more. So you don't have to live like that. You got to get out of that way of thinking, you know what I'm saying? Okay, okay. Shoreline. Right here. This the application. I got your ID, you fill it out. All right. What the hell? What is this? Look at this. Hey hey, man, don't, don't... This is, this is ridiculous, man. I need your initials here. Okay. Okay? All right, thank you. That's yours. Thank you. Okay. Thank you very much. No problem, nice meeting you. Shake the lady's hand. Good luck. Okay, thank you, thank you. What the heck is this. Oh, this is mine? Whee! You look like you got Tourette's. You going to get hit by a car. Oh, man. You got a nice little red fern tree. Whoo! All right, now to find my place. All the way to the top. Yes, sir. Okay, open sesame. Oh, man, oh, man. I got an air conditioner. Oh, man, look at the ceilings. They're clean. This is my bedroom, man. Hey, can I use your bathroom? No! Go ahead, use the bathroom, man. Oh, look at this here. Look at this here, look at this here. Oh man, is it Christmas?! Yeah. That stays on there. I can't believe this. Oh man, this is, this is, this is dynamite. Man, ooh, I'm about to blow up. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I want you to do me a favor. What's that? I want to throw out some things. Hold it, hold it, man. Some of the things you talk about throwing away, man, have been with me since I've been... man. You about to start a whole new life. Start over. Throw out some of that shit that was with you on the street and homeless. You don't need that. Like this bag, torn up. It don't smell good. That was my house on wheels. Throw this bag away. Man, I love this bag. This bag got me through the winter. Well, not no more. You don't need them bags. I got them in here. What is that? I don't know, memories. Ain't nothing in there. You don't know what's in here... Trash. ...until you look in here, man. Okay, look, garbage can. Man, some of my friends might be sleeping in there, man. Well, not you. Okay... oh, man. I've been living on the streets a long time. A good-a good 20 years. And I'm coming back but, you know, it's hard. I'm kind of lonely, you know, I'm... I mean, I'm here by myself and whatnot. You know, I go out and just walk around. Then I, you know, come back, turn right on in, and you know, do the things I do and whatnot. Call it a day, wait for the next morning. Hey, buddy! Buddy! Hold it, hold it, hold it. Come here. You, you ready for your drink? Yes, sir. Man, we're going to walk down there and get one. Hi, Brian. What's up, what's up Rosemary. How you been? I've been okay. Oh, yeah? That, that, that's a good thing ain't it. How about 50 cents then? Yeah. Let me see if I got 50 cents. You got a dollar? I don't got no money. I'm zero broke. Here. There baby, get to hook you up. Man, Wayne can't you let a friend watch the bags while we take care of the business? I'm going to pass, I'm going to pass. All right, bro, I'll stay here with you, man. Hey, I don't want to see you neither G.I. Joe. I'm dragging the bill on this one. All right, then, all right, man. Wayne, I'll be back with you man. Yeah? That's cool. There's a lot of stuff happening, man, that I'm not happy with, you know what I'm saying? Like, you say you want a job. But you sit and watch movies all day and sleep in your clothes. Don't nobody want to get you a job if you smell. You got to get your hair cut. Get back to when you first got cleaned up. How much money do you got on you right now? What, about $8. Go get a haircut, man. Tell me the truth, man. You been drinking? Tell me, no, don't... No, I ain't been drinking. Look at me, man. I'm looking at you, man. And I ain't been drinking. Do I smell like I've been drinking, man? From what I'm hearing, you're not taking AA seriously. Oh, well, see-see, that's what it is. You hear, you hearing from them, but you ain't hearing from me. I'm doing something every day. I want you to do better, man. I feel like you're going backwards. And if you don't do nothing about it, you going to be right back there in fucking Franciscan, man. Or you going be right back in the street with Wayne. You don't want to be that. Uhh... You don't want to be that. What's the problem? I got-I got things to do, too, man. All right, give me my money, man. That's what that's for, a haircut. I'm done, man. That's what I was saying, man. Holla at me when you get right, man. Shoot I told you, man, I can't-I can't... look. I'm tired of you doggone accusations of me. You're not taking this serious, man. I'm taking it too serious, but you ain't... You not taking it serious. You ain't taking me serious. I want a father that I'm proud to walk down the street with. You have to be better than what you was. You got to be better. Okay. Everything that need to be done with my father, we have to oversee and make sure that it's done. He can't be trained, but he can be controlled, the same way that when he was at Safe Haven, there was control. Even when he was on the street, if you don't get to the shelter by 7:00, you sleep outside. You know what I'm sayin'? Like, that's what he understands. Mm-hmm. I know his apartment is paid for for two years through that program, but that time is going to come quickly. In two years, if he's not employed, he's going to have to come and live here. Mmm-mmm. Or... Mmm-mmm. But after two years, you're not gonna want him to go back onto the streets. So, you have to start now, like, now. Yeah, you're right. Getting him prepared. So, how do we control him? Let's just make a list. So, Brian, your apartment is covered for two years, right? Right. So, what we want to do is develop a plan so that once that two years is up... Uh-huh. You'll be able to pay your bills and maybe even stay in the same apartment. Uh-huh, okay. So what's that plan? Just tell me the plan. Okay, so, Che do you want to go over it? Yes. Number one, you know you got to attend Heartland Alliance every Thursday. Right. But, we also have to find you a job. A five day a week, janitorial job. Because that's where you want to work. Right. The next one, food stamps. It has to go into the pot, because I know you're going to go buy beer. No, no. With your food stamps, you will. I want to buy food with my food stamps. No, no, no. Uh, the next one, attend a rehabilitation program. And I think that... That's AA. No, you gotta go to a place that got counselors. They got programs... No, no, no... I've... That's-that's taking too much of my time. No. Yes. No, listen, listen. I already spoke to your counselor. If you don't do this stuff... Uh-huh. You won't have an apartment. So these are things you-you, hold on... you have a... hold on. You gotta listen. I have to go to my doggone GED classes. No, no, no, no! You wasn't worried about your education for 40 fucking years. Hold on, hold on! Listen to what I'm saying. You got to go to rehabilitation. Uh-huh. Dad, look at me. Huh? Do you understand what I'm saying? Do you understand that you have an alcohol problem? Uh, no, you seem like... You think that I have an alcohol problem. But-but I mean, hey, you know. Hold it. Well, listen, this right here is non-negotiable. If it's not done, the apartment goes away and you just go back to the West side. How, how can you do that? You want to see? How can you... Don't ask me, do you want to see? You want to test me? Until you get a job, you're totally dependent on me. Right. I need you to sign that. Where it say Brian Tillman. Mm-kay, sure. Now remember, no drinking, man. Mm-hmm. Can you file that in the super important? Uh, that's his copy? Yeah. Oh, that contract thing just got me all mad. What-what the hell. He's saying, hey man whatever you get, give it to me! You know, I don't want you-I don't want... If I see you with a penny in your pocket, give it to me! You know? But-but, uh, can I? No. He's gonna-he's gonna keep it where I'll, I'll never have a nickel or dime. If I want something I gotta-I gotta act like a kid. I gotta act like a kid. Hey man, can I have that? Can I have that? No! No, no. You know, I get all that all the time. No, no, no, no, no. Uh, something says, something tell me that I moved a little bit too close. A little bit too close. Damn. Ugh. On 47th and King Drive. Man, why in the history of you working couldn't you really just keep a job? I can keep a job. I had that garbage truck job over 5 years. So, why you ain't come looking for me when you had a job? I did! You didn't. Man, believe me. I don't believe you. Believe me, man. 'Cause I was right over, you knew where I was right over at Aunt Dale's house. You knew I was over there. Well, how come you didn't come over-over, uh, to my house? I was ten! Uh-huh. It's not the child's job to go find the parent. Usually... usually. Uh, well... What the hey. Forget it, man. I found you I found me This is how it was supposed to be When I was 16 I started to add I subtracted the pain and divided the bad Multiplied my grind with the fraction I had And all the multiple men never equaled to dad, dad, dad I found you I found me This is how it was supposed to be Hey, start over. What you think about this song, man? It's... You don't like this song? I don't like the beginning of the song. Why not? Well, it's uh, you know, it- it-it depicts me, man. As what? As a no-good, as, as a beat-down dad. You don't think you's a deadbeat? No, man, I wasn't... I didn't start off a deadbeat dad. You know. I just want to hear it. But you don't even know what you're listening to. I'm just saying, it's saying lost and found, ain't it? What'd I'd lose and what I'd find? You lost your- your-your father. And you found your father, ain't it? Yeah, I guess. Okay, what the hey. I found you I found me This is how it was supposed to be My mama boyfriend taught me how to womanize How to work from the truth to tell women lies Never had a father I blame my mama She made bad judgment to have horrible karma Do you hear that, Mr. Tillman? Yeah, yeah. What am I saying in this song, Mr. Tillman? Hey, man, you-you making it on your own, man. That's what you're saying in the songs. And what does that mean to you to hear this? You know, wait, you-you, uh... Where was you at, nigga? I was around. Oh, all right, let me finish this verse. Second verse. This is how it was supposed to be If I said that I loved you I be telling the truth If I told you I hated you I'd be telling the truth So when I call you a coward I'm just letting it loose Don't look shocked you being gone is proof Yeah it's easy to make them and it's hard to raise them Why did daddy leave who created the mayhem? Don't matter no more I already forgave him I got kids of my own and I currently raising them ...clinic. Hey, how you doing? This is Che Smith. I had the, uh, paternity test done for Che and uh, Joli. Yes, I have those results. I made it, a lot. What's that? The, This is the, this is the DNA letter. You know you haven't told me. I know, I was waiting. Let me see. All right, well here. Okay. Wow. Now we know the truth. Right? How do you feel? I mean, you know, I was already paying on the package. I know. Good thing I was, right? Yeah. It's a good thing. Mmm... The truth. It's not like I wasn't doing nothing. Right. And it's not like I didn't, like, try to go down and do the things that I was supposed to do anyway. Right. And so, uh... I's hot and I'm sweating, um... But that's okay. I mean, I don't see it being a problem. Or why it should be a problem. Uh-huh... I'm not saying it's a problem, I'm just... Mm-hmm. What do you mean, mm-hmm? I was saying, yeah, okay. Can I have a hug? What's wrong? What's wrong? Nothing... It's gonna burn. That's what you got to do. You got to go to roll call and whatnot. They got to be shined. 79th street. I'm working, I'm trying to, you know, make it so that I can have at least another place, you know, when this two years is up and whatnot. But, it's, it's kind of cold out there. The way I heard, you know from my boy, Blue, most of my friends died, you know. I'm surprised I ain't dead. But to tell you the truth, I'm still in the streets. I'm still doing the things that I was doing when I was homeless. Picking up trash. That's what I do. So, apparently, uh, apparently... my sister just called me and told me that, uh, my father called my mother, and he had been drinking, so she thinks he's drunk. I'm at his apartment, and I'm going to walk in and see. What you doing? You scaring the hell out of me, man. What you doing, man? What you doing? Why are you in the dark with your coat on? You scaring me, man. Coming to my house, man. You didn't ring the bell, nothing. I got a key. Turn the TV off. What is this, what the fuck is this, man? Pour it in the toilet. Pour it in the toilet. Do you see what I'm doing? This is for you, and... I'm disappointed in you. No, no, no, no, no. Listen, listen! I helped fix you up. I got you in programs. I helped get you an apartment. I brought you in the family. And this is how you repay me. Hold it, man, let me tell you something. I'm-I'm-I'm the daddy! I am the daddy! So what does that mean? It means this is my house. You going to lose your apartment. I pay-I pay-I pay... Hey, hey, hey, hey Hey, hey! When you, hey! When you end up back on the... listen! When you... listen! When you end up back on the street... That's the first thing I do... When you, when you end up on the street, I'm not going to come get you again. You're going to come get me, you're gonna find me... No, I'm not. You go to lost and found. You're going to find me. And I'ma find you. No. All right, I'm done. Yo, yo, yo, yo, I'm done. Che! Don't come to my house. Che! You don't need it. After I saw my father drinking, it was like a spark went out inside of me. It was him choosing alcohol over me again. And it was too much pain. I came into an understanding of why my father had been gone for 28 years. And that pain never goes away. And I had to make a decision on could he be in my life from this point on. Did I lose him again? And the first time I was- I was young, so he abandoned me. This time... I abandon him. I was delusional about what a father was. I was trying to make Brian be something that I dreamed of as a child, instead of accepting who he is. I have to love my father as an alcoholic. I started something that I can't turn back. Hey! Hey! What's up dog? What's up, man? You, man. How you feeling, man? Aw, pretty good. You watching Jerry Springer? Yeah. I got my cable on, man. I got something for you. What's that? I got a good old-fashioned ass whooping. Oh, no! Right now. Here, you grab it, old man. Old man? Stop your madness. Because I'm gon' sure put it on you. Yeah. Okay, I got something for you now. Oh, no. Oh, yeah. When Che went looking for Brian, he just had a lot of questions. Man, you got me in a pickle here. And many of those have been answered. Merry Christmas! Happy holiday. Brian's presence has really helped make Che feel like a more whole person. And because of that he's more engaged in every other family member's life. Here we go. Almighty God, thank you for keeping us healthy and safe on this day. And thank you for the best gift of all, which is bringing us together as family, amen. Amen. All right! What I needed in knowing who my father was, I received that. And he's a part of this house now. My father has someone to love him for the rest of his life. Yay! Oh, no! Oh, no! All this is, like, new to me and whatnot. All right. There's so many things you got to remember and so many things you got to do, it's, ooh... Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. When I'm taking one day at a time, slowly but surely, until I perfect this stuff. We're in a chess game of life right now. It's like we're in the middle of a game. And I'm coming straight at ya. Let me see you smile. Yeah, man. That's a beautiful smile. I know! I feel ten years younger. I mean, uh, I'm a lot more confident in myself. I'm seeing if I can get me a better job than what I'm doing now and whatnot, so... I hope... I can't wait till the world see me now. When I found you, I found me This is how it was supposed to be When I found you, I found me This is how it was supposed to be When I found you, I found me This is how it was supposed to be My mama boyfriend taught me how to womanize How to run from the truth and tell women lies Never had a father and I blame my mama She made bad judgments and had horrible karma Couldn't even find a decent man for me to honor Nope Got my degree from the streets That was my alma mater Yeah Call my homies my cousins and the hustlers my brothers We had our own clique, we roll for each other They taught me how to pick locks, how to ditch cops And how to break the coke down into small rocks And told me if you got a pistol, you ain't gotta box Put his brains in the streets and make 'em all wiser But at 16 I started to add What? I subtracted the pain and divided the dad Multiply my ground with a fraction I had And all the multiple men never equaled a dad When I found you, I found me This is how it was supposed to be When I found you, I found me Oh... Yeah, yeah This is how it was supposed to be So glad, I'm so glad that I found you I-I just... I just wanted us to get... get along, you know, and do some things that we haven't done, you know, wh-while we was, you know, apart. That's what I'm saying. But hey. Now, see, the thing is, I-I'm steadily working, and I'm trying to be with my grandchildren as much as I can. You know, I-I live right... right down the street from 'em. So that I can visit my grandchildren. I got my crib. I'm... you know, I'm-I'm moving on, and... you know, th-there... there is no excuses.
