[MIMICKING A COUPLE] "Good morning, sweetheart." "Good morning." "How you feeling?" "Fine." "I have your breakfast ready just the way you like it." "It looks like a beautiful day outside." "Here, let me pour you some tea." "Is something wrong?" [IN AN ANGRY VOICE] "This tea is cold! "Are you stupid? Can't you make a lousy pot of tea?" "I'm sorry. I'll heat it up." "Forget it. I don't like your stupid tea." [CRASHING] JANET: April! I'm in my room. What are you doing? Just playing. [SIGHS] Didn't I ask you to clean up your room? Yes. Well? Can I have a cookie first? How about if you clean up your room first and I'll give you a cookie afterward. But, Mom, if I have a cookie first I'll be in a better mood while I'm cleaning. [CHUCKLES] Okay. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] Mommy! [DOORBELL RINGS] Oh, my God. Surprised? I thought... Yeah, it's called early release. They reduce your sentence by half for good behavior. Aren't you gonna invite us in? Um... The judge said you're not allowed within 500 feet of this house. Come on, Janet. Just for a minute. I'll even keep the meter running. You haven't changed anything. What do you want? [EXHALES] What do I want? What do you think I want? I want us to be together again. A family. The way we used to be. Isn't that what we both want, Jan? Just to put our lives back together? Please. Just go. Where's April? She's not home. She's still at school. RICHARD: April's still at school. That expensive school she goes to gets out at 1:00, Janet. [SCOFFS] She's upstairs, isn't she? I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go take care of some things, but I'll be back. So why don't you have... [GASPS] Why don't you have the restraining order lifted, get all dressed up, you and April. We'll all go out and celebrate my homecoming. Hmm? [WHISPERS] I love you. [PANTING] [MOCK PANTING] You call this running? Yeah. Ha! My uncle Clarence, you know him, right? Right. He's 93. [PANTING] Gets to the dinner table faster than you run. Ha! That's funny. [CHUCKLES] Honey, you look a little overheated. Need some water? Yeah, sure. Okay. [SQUIRTS WATER] Thank you. Sure. Damn. You so slow, you make Sunday Mass look like an action movie. [PANTING] [GROANS LOUDLY] [GROANING] Okay, are you all right? Yeah, I think I really went over on that one. Aw. [GIGGLING] [CHUCKLES] [BOTH GIGGLING] I got you. Yeah. You know, I recall one activity where you enjoy the fact that I'm slow. Oh, yeah. RAY: So, how's it coming? CARRIE: Did you know that one in three women will be assaulted in her lifetime by a domestic partner? Does that mean the article's gonna be ready for this Sunday's edition? Next week, promise. Next week? You said that last week. Still no article. Honey, you've surrounded yourself with this research for three weeks and you still haven't written anything. This is my chance to really write something special. Besides, tonight's my first night on the lines. And then it's over, right? Look, Ray, if you're really that concerned, just take me off the story. No, no, no. I don't care about the story. This is about you. This subject. It can't help but bring up things from your past. Look, Ray, I know you're concerned and I love you for that. But I'm a big girl. Okay? I can handle it. [SIGHS] You call me later at the office. Yeah, yeah. Don't worry. [CHUCKLES] Yeah, yeah. Hey, your phone, Carrie! [DOOR CLOSES] Is he gonna live with us? No. Why did he come back? I don't know. But I thought you said... Honey... I promise, everything's gonna be okay. But what if he hurts you? He's never gonna hurt me again. [DOORBELL BUZZES] Yes? JANET: It's us. [BUZZING] Hi, Aunt Kate. How's my favorite niece? My daddy came home today. I know. I've got your favorite show on the bedroom TV, so why don't you go watch while I talk to Mommy, okay? You're not going back there. What are my choices? Running the rest of my life? Moving every six months till he finally tracks me down? Even if I was willing to do that, what kind of life is that for April? So what are you gonna do? I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna face him. You think he's gonna listen to you? He'll listen. This time he'll listen. COUNSELOR: Women's Crisis Line. WOMAN: Look, I want to know if there's some kind of law that can keep my husband... [BANGING ON DOOR] WOMAN: Oh, my God! He's coming in. COUNSELOR: Ma'am? WOMAN: Help me, please! You've got to... COUNSELOR: Ma'am, where are you? WOMAN: No, help me! COUNSELOR: Ma'am... WOMAN: Help me! COUNSELOR: Can you get away? WOMAN: Don't, please don't! [WOMAN AND MAN YELLING] WOMAN: I'm sorry... COUNSELOR: Are you all right? WOMAN: I'm sorry, I'm sorry! [LOUD THUDDING] [GLASS BREAKING] [GUNSHOTS FIRED] [LINE DISCONNECTS] What could that counselor have done differently? Trace the call? Hmm, not enough time. She needed to get the address. Well, she tried. You heard that. The first thing she said was, "Where are you?" [TELEPHONE RINGING] [SIGHS] The answer is, there was nothing she could do. That is the hardest part of this job. When you find yourself sitting here with a dead phone, thinking about how you failed, and there's no way for me to train or prepare you to handle it. Your ability to both do your best and still understand your limitations will be what finally determines if you'll be able to stick with this work or not. So, the idea is not to get too involved, right? ELEANOR: Well, the question is, what is too involved? If you're going home at the end of your shift carrying the pain of this with you, then, yeah, you're too involved. On the other hand, you know, no woman calling in the middle of a crisis wants to open herself up to some unfeeling technician. So, your involvement is crucial. Yeah, it's like a lifeguard. You have to swim out... ELEANOR: And then be able to swim back again. Because your emotional well-being is as important to me as the caller's. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [BOTH GIGGLING] [INAUDIBLE] I missed you so much. Who's the guy? Just some guy from school. Yeah, I want to meet him, okay? Greg! Greg... Hey, come here. Um, Missy says you're a friend of hers. Is that right? Yeah, we all go to Lincoln. Greg, stop it. Look, all right, I'm not doing anything, okay. I just wanted to come over here and I wanted to introduce myself to your friends, okay? All right, my name's Greg. What's your name? Alan. Alan? All right, Alan, did Missy tell you I'm her boyfriend? Did she tell you that? Yeah, she brings it up all the time. Would you do me a favor and you try to remember that? Can you do that? Yeah, sure, man. Yeah? Whatever. Good. Missy, that guy is a geek. Okay? Why'd you have to do that? Do what? Missy, that guy, he's just trying to get in your pants, okay. That's all he's doing. Missy, wait a second. Just wait a second. All right, look! I am sorry, okay. I said it, I'm sorry. DEB: What made you want to be a volunteer? Wanting to help, I guess. Thinking that if someone was desperate enough to call a stranger, maybe I could be that person on the other end. Yeah. [INHALES] Well, so far we've only had one caller and they hung up. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Don't you worry. The rush is gonna get started any minute now. It gets busier after dark? Oh, yeah. The work day ends, the bars fill up, and all the anger people keep bottled up all day, it gets... [TELEPHONE RINGS] Women's Crisis Line. MISSY: Can you just tell me how to stop a guy from being jealous? What happens when he gets jealous? He just gets angry, I mean, he just goes off. Does he hit you? No, I mean, maybe just one time but that's... That's all. It was... It was my fault anyways. You're wrong. Um... Look, I just want to know if there's something I can do to make him not be so jealous all the time. What's your name? Missy. Let me ask you a question, Missy. Aren't you really calling because you're afraid of him? [MEEKLY] No. Why would I be afraid of him? Because if he's hit you once he's gonna do it again. And that's not true. It is true, Missy. I think you know that. I think you know, you... You're in a dangerous relationship. Do you understand what I'm saying, Missy? I can't talk right now. I have to go. With him? Yes. Will you call me later? I'll try. Um, what's your name? Oh, it doesn't matter, anyone here... Fine. I don't care. Carrie. My name is Carrie. Okay, maybe I'll call you later. [LINE DISCONNECTS] What's the matter? I didn't handle that very well. No, you're wrong. You planted the seed. Now she knows there's someone she can talk to. The problem is, she's blaming herself. They always do. Especially if they're young or abused as children. [INHALES] [EXHALES] [COCKS GUN] CARRIE: Women's Crisis Line. Are you all right? I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm doing this. Maybe you just need someone to talk to. That makes sense, doesn't it? Have you been drinking? Yes. I've been drinking. But it's not something I normally do. Why are you drinking now? To kill pain. Gather courage. But it doesn't really help, does it? Why do you need courage? I'm gonna kill my husband. [WHISPERS] Stay calm. I'm sorry. Did I frighten you? Aren't you frightened? Yes. I suppose. Well, then let's call the police. And have them do what? Violate his restraining order? Put him in jail another 18 months? It's not gonna stop him. It's just gonna delay the inevitable. You could go to a shelter. He'd find me sooner or later. [STAMMERS] Where are you? What's your address? I won't tell you that. But if you're in danger... The only thing I'm in danger of is running out of vodka. [INHALES] I'm gonna have to make a quick trip to Ted's. Wait, don't go. Hmm... You can't help me. You haven't given me a chance yet. All the same, you've been really sweet to keep me company. Let's keep talking. Here's how it's gonna happen. So you'll know when they arrest me and you see me on the news. Wait. He'll come to the door, he'll ask for our daughter. Don't do this. She won't be here. Then he'll start to hit me. And I'll pull out my gun. And I'll fire every bullet I've got into him. So, now you can tell the reporters we talked, just before the punching bag punched back. [INHALES] Please, don't... Don't... [LINE DISCONNECTS] ELEANOR: Carrie, there's nothing more you can do. That is not true. I can help her. No, you can't. She hung up. And you can't help someone who won't let you help. But if I can find her... Absolutely not. I thought you said we were supposed to help these women. I thought you said we were supposed to swim out. Not in these dangerous waters. Not when I've seen lifeguards drown. Carrie, I know your heart's in the right place. But you are just going to have to accept this. Do you understand? I understand. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Women's Crisis Line. DEB: No, that's okay. Take your time. Can I go out for a breath of fresh air? Carrie, I know this is hard for you. I'm just gonna go out for a while. Carrie. Carrie! [POLICE SIRENS WAILING] [DOOR CLOSES] [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [TIRES SQUEALING] [HORN HONKING] [TIRES SQUEALING] [CARRIE MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY] Ted's. 3531 Lakeshore. DEB: I hope she's all right. Hope's not enough, honey. But what if she's able to help that woman? What if she's not? What if she gets caught in a situation she can't control? Did that happen to you? No, not to me. To a counselor who worked here. She was very bright and very intuitive. And she took a call from a woman who was afraid of leaving her husband. And without telling me or anyone else, this counselor arranged to meet with this woman. What happened? The husband came back unexpectedly and slashed them both to death with a straight razor. [SIGHS] [TELEPHONE RINGS] Women's Crisis Line. It's a man who says he's Carrie's fiance. Hello, I'm the director here. How can I help you? Yeah, sorry. I don't mean to tie up your lines there, but if it's possible I'd like to speak to Carrie, please. [TYPING] What do you mean, "unavailable"? Is she... Is she on a call or something? On my desk, please. She's all yours. So, are you new in town? No, just back from an extended trip. Yeah, where'd you go? Hell. That must have been some kind of a bad vacation, huh? You got a phone I can use? Down the road a piece. Why, thank... Oh! Jeez, am I sorry. Sorry about that. Thank you. WOMAN OVER PA: J.D., you have a call on line two. J.D., pick up line two, please. [TELEPHONE RINGING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [TRACTOR ENGINE RUMBLING] ANSWERING MACHINE: Hello, you've reached Mike McConnell with the Department of Parole. I'm not able to come to the phone right now, but if you leave a message I'll get right back to you as soon as possible. [BEEPS] Mr. McConnell, Richard Sutherland here. Uh, I know we're supposed to get together today, but, uh, it's these... Pressing issues that I've... MIKE: Sutherland? Mr. McConnell! Hey, hi, uh... Jeez, I thought you'd left for the day. MIKE: You were supposed to be here two hours ago, weren't you? Yeah, I'm sorry about that. That's actually why I'm calling. I, um... Got, uh, caught in traffic, I lost track of time. Well, where are you now? What? I said, where are you now? Oh, gee. Boy, uh... Bishop Avenue. Uh, probably a good hour from your office. You haven't gone near your wife's house, have you? No. No, sir. So you're on Bishop now, way up by the shopping center? Yeah, way out there. All right then. Okay, um, sorry about this. Maybe I'll see you next week? There's a place called, uh, Men's Recovery Center on Bishop and 83rd. I got a group starting there in 15 minutes. I'll see you then. [STUTTERS] Mr. McConnell, you know... [CLEARS THROAT] I just, um... I just... I really don't think that I need this kind of thing. And what I mean by that is that I'm... I'm not good or comfortable with, uh, groups... MIKE: The terms of your release require you to attend rage management sessions or finish your sentence in prison. So I suggest you get your ass over here. Okay... [STAMMERS] How about next week? No. I'll see you in 15 minutes. [LINE DISCONNECTS] Okay, good... I'll see you then. Nice talking to you. [PHONE CLATTERS] [GRUNTS] [YELLING] [KIDS MURMURING] Show's over. BOY: Whatever. [MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR RADIO] [CAR ENGINE TURNS OFF] [MUSIC STOPS] [SIGHS] Look, I said I was sorry, Missy. It just keeps happening, that's all. So, what does that mean? You don't wanna see me anymore? I didn't say that. Mmm, mmm-hmm. Well, maybe it'd be best. I mean, I know you don't really care about me anyway. How can you say that? How can I say that? Missy, we've been dating for what, two months now, and you're still giving me this Little Miss Good Girl thing. Yeah, I just thought you were a little bit older than that. I just wanna go slow, that's all. [WHISPERS] Yeah. Well, maybe I'm just wasting my time, you know? Maybe you'd rather be with that guy Alan, I don't know. Look, I got you something and if you don't want it, I understand, but I wanted to give it to you. Oh, my God! [LAUGHS] It's so beautiful. Maybe now you'll see how much I really do love you. Oh, Greg. Does this mean you forgive me? You know I do. [BREATHING HEAVILY] This mean you're gonna give me what I want? Hmm? Greg, I gotta get home. Greg, stop it. Greg, stop it. Greg, stop it! Fine! You go home to your mommy and your daddy. And you call me when you decide to grow up, Missy. All right? [CAR ENGINE STARTS] Let me get $5 in lottery tickets. JANET: Fifth of vodka, please. I don't need a bag. [HORN HONKING] [TIRES SQUEALING] [HORN HONKING] [TIRES SKIDDING] [HORN HONKING] [GASPS] [METAL SCRAPING] [SCREAMS] [CRASHES] CARRIE: Oh, my God! Are you hurt? I don't think so. Okay, come on. Let's get you home. Okay, look out. Through here. [SOBS] I'm not what you think I am. I know that. Do I know you? No, I just have one of those familiar faces. Come on, let's get you home. [LIGHTER FLICKS] I'm gonna punch her face in. I'm thinking... Maybe three months in prison, hell, it's worth it. I mean, I'm not gonna take this from her. I mean, I'm just gonna do it. MIKE: What stopped you? I saw my workbook. Truth is, I was probably gonna throw it at her. [MAN COUGHING] And it hit me just how much this represents. How hard I'm trying to stop my damn self. So, I just started walking. I kept walking till about 6:00 in the morning. [DOOR OPENS] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] RICHARD: Hello. Sorry I'm late. MIKE: Well, the idea is to get here on time, not halfway through the session. As long as you're here, come on in. Introduce yourself to the group. [MAN COUGHING] I'm Richard Sutherland. Ah, go ahead. Everybody's here for the same reasons. I'm Richard Sutherland and, uh... I was just released from the Inland Men's Correctional Facility. What did you do? I was an executive with an insurance company. No, man. What did you do? I assaulted my wife. With what? The shaft of a golf club. You put her in the hospital? I don't understand the point of this. You're a sick son of a bitch who's looking to make somebody else pay for the... That's not true. You're telling me that that bitch threw you in jail, destroyed your career, took away everything that you have, and you're not even just a little bit pissed off? No. You're under control, aren't you? Mr. Ice Cube. You're not like the rest of the guys. That's right. And all I want now is to get on with the rest of my life. [TV PLAYING] Did you get that birthday card for your cousin? I forgot. I'll get it tomorrow. Where did you get that? Greg gave it to me. You're kidding. Oh, let me see it. Let me see. [GASPS] Oh, Missy. Oh, it's so beautiful. MISSY'S FATHER: Hey! Is anybody gonna bring me a beer? Hang on! You know, you're a very lucky girl. You don't meet guys like Greg every day. He wants me to go out with him later. You know your dad doesn't like you going out on school nights. Okay. Okay? What do you mean? [SNORTS] If that's the only fight you're gonna put up, maybe you ought to get the beer and I'll go out with Greg tonight. [CHUCKLES] I'll talk to your dad. I appreciate you taking me home like this. And I would invite you in, but I'm really not feeling well. Well, could... Could I make you a cup of coffee or something? [SNIFFS] It's very kind but I will be fine. Something wrong? I know who you are. I know what you've been planning. Who are you? I spoke to you over the phone, I took your call at the Women's Crisis... Just get out! Not until you listen to me. Why should I? You don't know what you're talking about. There are shelters. There are restraining orders. Don't talk to me about restraining orders. This one says, uh, he can't call. This one says he can't come within 500 feet of this house. You think any of these make a difference? I'm the one that sent him to prison. I'm the one he blames for everything. And... And none of these pieces of paper are gonna make a difference to stop him now that he's back. So you're just gonna ruin your life? My life was ruined a long time ago. And your daughter, she doesn't need you to be whole? I'm doing this for her. That's not true. You don't know. Ask her. Do you think she wants to go to trial? You think she wants to see her mom behind bars for the rest of her life? Just... Just go. We can do this another way, Janet. We can pack your clothes and just go. And go where? To a shelter that will take you and your daughter. Where is she? She's at my sister's. JANET: The suitcases are in the closet. I'll go get April's things. You are saying that this was all to get a story for the paper? No, no, I'm saying that she was doing research for her article on domestic violence. So, she misrepresented herself to me? No, she needed to get inside and she needed to find out what was happening first-hand. That's all. And is that what she's doing right now? Just getting a little more up-close and personal? Fine. [SIGHS] This is more than just an assignment to her. Carrie grew up in an incredibly abusive family. She was 10, and her father beat her mother to death. And it's possible she even saw it happen. What do you mean, "it's possible"? I've lived with her for three years and she still won't talk to me about it. Where's her father now? He died shortly before the trial. That's all I know. Except now that she's researching the story, it's all started to come to the surface. You realize that if she's out there trying to undo her past, she's in a lot more danger than the woman she's trying to help. You must have some kind of caller ID here, some kind of tracing system? How many women do you think would call if it got out we ID'd every call? So what about emergency situations? If we keep a line open, the phone company can trace a call, that's all. So you have no idea where Carrie is? All I know is that the woman had a restraining order and her husband was released from prison after 18 months. Who are you calling? Friend of mine at the DA's office. That might be enough to go on. Yeah, I need to talk to Lenny Oppenheimer right away, please. You ready? Where is it? You're going to a shelter, you don't need it, Janet. You haven't answered my question. Oh, my God! What is it? He used to make me, uh, choose something I loved and then he'd smash it. Teach me a lesson. And then he'd make me keep a piece of it so I'd remember. Why didn't you just leave him? I was... I was afraid he'd kill me. And I was afraid I couldn't live without him. That sounds really stupid, doesn't it? I thought he was so much better than I deserved. So much smarter and stronger. I thought I was lucky to have him. Why wasn't he lucky to have you? I need to grab my purse. [GASPS] Hi, Janet. Janet, stay calm. Hello, I don't think I've had the pleasure. I'm a friend of Janet's. What a coincidence that you just happened to drop by on the same night that I come home. Couldn't be that you didn't want to be alone with me, could it? She's just a friend. Her car broke down. I gave her a lift. Thanks. That's nice of you. And I don't mean to be rude but I think Janet and I would like to be alone now. Hmm? I'm afraid that's not... He's right. Janet, listen to me. Excuse me! Excuse me! We haven't seen each other for quite a while and I think we need our privacy. Right? Please. Just go. Hey, thanks for everything. Nice meeting you. Thanks for helping out. Appreciate it. Drive safely. We need to talk. Do you think my mommy's okay? I'm sure she is. But... What if she isn't? April, honey, your mom and dad are gonna work this out. Everything's gonna be fine. Why does he have to be angry all the time? I don't know. I don't think your daddy can help it. Don't worry, sweetheart. Your mommy's going to be fine. I told you, I want to see my daughter. She's not yours anymore. Are you trying to get me angry? I don't care. I'm not afraid of you anymore. Well, you know, maybe that was the problem. You never were, you know, not enough, anyway, not enough to do even the littlest things that I asked. I'm telling you to get... All I ever wanted... ...out of this house! ...was a little respect. To be treated like a man in my own house. A house I bought and paid for. And now you think you can just kick me out. Hmm? You think you can just take my daughter and tell me to go away? Is that what you think? Get out of this house. [SCREAMS] Why are you doing this? Why? I am warning you... [PHONE RINGS] DEB: Hello, Women's Crisis Line. MISSY: Can I speak to Carrie, please? I'm sorry, Carrie's not here right now. Can I help you? That's okay, it doesn't matter. Is this Missy? How did you know that? Carrie said that you might call. My name is Deb, by the way. Well, I don't really have anything to say, so... Why don't you just tell me what's going on? [CAR DOOR OPENING] CARRIE: Okay, call 911... [PHONE CHIMES] Damn it! [TIRES SQUEALING] You don't understand, my... My parents think he's great. My friends think he's great. I mean, half the girls I know are trying to get him into bed. And that makes everything all right? Well, maybe not, but you're making it seem like he's some kind of monster. All right, not a monster. Just a guy who scares and occasionally hits you. Look, I just... I know if I talk to him, we can work it out. Missy, there are other boys. But he loves me. He... He said it. RAY: Lenny, listen, I understand that. All I'm asking is that you check your records. LENNY: Oh, come on, for what, Ray? An unnamed inmate who did unknown time in an undisclosed prison... No, no, no. He... He did 18 months, and we know that it was for spousal abuse. Well, if he did 18 months, that means it had to be level four. Well, level four, what is that? It means he used a weapon. Lenny, listen, Carrie could be with this guy right now. All right, I'll call you back in a few minutes. All right. MISSY: Look, I want to stay with him, okay? So, if you can't help me hold it together, then I might as well just hang up. Well, when do you think you're going to see him again? Tonight. Missy, that's not a good idea. It's not a big deal. We're just going out. Then see him at your house. With my parents here? I'm sure. MISSY'S MOTHER: Missy! Greg's here. I have to go. Don't be alone with him, Missy. Don't worry. Promise me, Missy. Don't worry. I... Just tell Carrie I say thanks. [LINE DISCONNECTS] What do you think's gonna happen? I don't know. Come here. Where are we going? Someplace special. Look, I just wanna talk. Don't worry. We're just gonna have some fun. Okay? What's this? What's this, huh? Come on, tell me, what is this? What, you running away with your little friend there, Janet? I didn't wanna run. I wanted to stay and face you. I'm standing right here. What do you want to say? Get out of this house and don't ever come back. That's very funny, Janet. I'm warning you. Where's my daughter? Go to hell! You know, you got quite a little mouth on you there, Janet. You wanna say that to me again, Janet? Say it to me. [SCREAMS] [YELLING] Come on, say it again! Go to hell. Come on. Say it! [SCREAMING] Say it! Come on! Come on, say it! Come on, I want you to say it. Say it! [DOG BARKING] RICHARD: Come on, say it! [JANET SCREAMING] [GLASS SHATTERS] [JANET SCREAMING] RICHARD: Come on, I wanna hear you say it! Say it! [HANDLE RATTLES] JANET: Please, Richard! I'll be good. I'll be... [SOBS] JANET: Please, Richard! Please! [GLASS BREAKS] RICHARD: You think I like doing this? [MOUTHING] [LINE RINGING] You cannot give me 200 names. All I'm asking for is a print-out of incoming calls. Look, you gotta be able to help me here. Yeah, I'm calling shelters regarding a woman who... [PHONE RINGING] Can you hold, please? Women's Crisis Line. [WHISPERING] It's Carrie. Carrie! Lenny, hang on. Hold the line. I tried to call 911 but I couldn't get through. Tell Eleanor to call the cops, now. Where are you? Ray? RICHARD: Hang it up! Carrie, can you hear me? RICHARD: Hang up the phone or I'll kill her. [LINE DISCONNECTS] [SIGHS] [PANTING] Now, who are you? Who are you? I'm a reporter. I was doing an article on domestic violence when Janet called the crisis line. I don't believe this. I don't believe you! Run! Shut up! Hey! You go near that door, I'll kill her. [TRAIN HORN BLOWING] Brought us a little something. Here. I don't want any. Oh, yeah, I guess you're right, I guess, uh, Mommy and Daddy wouldn't approve, now, would they? Here, just take a sip. It's okay. You can take another sip. Here, let me help you. [GAGS] Oh, jeez. [COUGHS] Oh, man. [COUGHS] You've got a lot of nerve, lady. I'm just trying to help. Yeah? Help? Who? Write a story for your newspaper? No, that's not why I'm... Shut up. Please, you have to listen to me. I said shut up. I know why you're doing this. I know... [CRASHING] RICHARD: Who do you... Who do you think you are? You think you can talk to me? You think you know me? Yes, my father was just like you. He couldn't... You're not quite so tough now, are you? [SCREAMS] [GLASS SHATTERING] Huh? Janet, no! [GUN FIRES] What did you do? What'd you do? Don't move. [COUGHS] You all right? [COUGHS] You okay? [BREATHES HEAVILY] I'm sorry, I didn't mean for that to happen. Okay, let's get you out of those wet clothes, 'cause... Stop it. I thought we were gonna have some fun, Missy. MISSY: I don't want to! Why are you always trying to force me? Force you? What? Is that a joke, Missy? Do you know how many girls I could have every week if I wanted to? You know what those girls would be doing right now if I gave them something like this? Huh? You know what I should do? I should give this to your friend from, uh, from the mall. What's her name? Karen? Huh? You remember Karen, don't you? What do you mean? Oh, you didn't know? Yeah, I met, uh, I met Karen a couple of weeks ago at a party and she showed me a really, really good time. She earned this, Missy. She has twice the body you got. Just take me home. Of course, you do still have a lot of this, uh, this little baby fat on... Why are you doing this? I'm gonna be sick. You go be sick. [GRUNTS] RICHARD: What, are you gonna kill me, Janet? You've wanted to finish me off for a long time, haven't you? [WHISPERS] Go on. [SHOUTS] Do it! You think I won't? You might as well, because I'm never gonna stop being your husband. You're gonna die. RICHARD: If that's what you want, Janet. "Do you take this man "to be your lawful, wedded husband? "For rich or for poor. In sickness and health. "Till death do us part." You remember those vows, Janet? [SNIFFLING] Why can't you just leave me alone? RICHARD: Because I love you, Janet. And I always will. And you wanna know something? [SOBBING] I believe you love me too. I hate you. [CRYING] Yeah, but you don't have the guts to pull the trigger, do you? You are weak and stupid. Damn it, I don't care what you have to do. I want that call sourced right now or I... [PHONE RINGING] Hold on. RICHARD: I want you both to shut up, and just listen to me. This is very important, okay? The next one to open her mouth is gonna die. [SHOUTS] Now that I have the gun, there are not gonna be any more games. Of course, the big question is... What do I do with you? JANET: Let her go. Now why would I do that? So you can go call the police, have me sent to prison? Is that how your little story ends? If you don't do something about your shoulder, you're gonna bleed to death. You're concerned about me. Get me some towels. Get me some towels! RICHARD: Since when did crusading reporters ever give a damn about the lives that they messed up? CARRIE: I didn't mess up your life. What the hell is taking them so long? The call's originating from a different district. The trace could take upwards of an hour. Oh! I don't believe this. CARRIE: I know you think I'm responsible. RICHARD: You don't even know the meaning of that word. You have no concept of what it takes to be responsible. To be a man in this world. [PHONE RINGING] Women's Crisis Line. It's Leonard Oppenheimer for Ray. Leonard Oppenheimer from the DA's office. Yeah? Derrick White, Roger Ozal, Richard Sutherland. They were all released from state prisons within the last 48 hours for spousal assault. Now, if your theory is right, your guy's probably one of them, but I have no idea which. Yeah, I need addresses and phone numbers. RICHARD: This world is a sewer, and the only way you get out is by being tougher than every other idiot who's trying to drag you right back down. Did your father teach you that? My father? My father was an alcoholic who sat around and did nothing his entire life. You think I'm like him? Hmm? I worked my entire life to provide for my family. I earned the respect that's coming to me. But I'm not allowed to come within 100 yards of my own house. And because of my wife, my daughter April is afraid of me. Afraid of her own father. I see the way she looks at me. [LINE RINGING] MAN: Hello? Hello, is this Derrick White? Yeah, who's this? Never mind, you've just told me what I need to know. Thanks. You're gonna let her do this to you? Missy? Missy, look, I'm really sorry, okay? Missy, come on, I didn't mean to hurt you, okay? I'm sorry. Can you hear me? Missy, please, if something were to happen to you, I don't know what I would do. Missy, please, if you can hear me, just tell me where you are. Huh, Missy? Just tell me where you are. I'm over here. Just keep talking so I can find you. Keep going, I'm over here. [DIALING] [BUSY TONE SOUNDING] [BUSY TONE SOUNDING] It could be anyone. No, it's him. Call the cops. Ray, wait. No, do it. Call the cops. You think I'm sick? Bad father? No feeling? No love? Let me tell you something. I love my daughter. I never once laid a hand on her. Ever. Your father beat you, didn't he? What my father did to me makes a beating sound... You're playing me, aren't you? Little psychological tricks. You think you're in control? I'm in control. Now, you're gonna... You're gonna tell me where to find April. Don't look at her. She's in a shelter. [SIGHS] Where? Don't play games with me. It's a shelter for children. What's the name? It doesn't have a name. It's just a shelter. [WHISPERS] You're a liar. Now... [WINCES] You're gonna tell me where to find April. Don't tell him. Shh. She's gonna die. That what you want? She's gonna die. [GUN COCKING] RICHARD: Say goodbye to your new friend, Janet. At Kate's. Call her. You tricked me. We're getting out of here. Let's go. No. [SCREAMS] [GROANS] You did this. This is your fault. Up! [SCREAMS] Open the door. [ENGINE REVVING] [TIRES SQUEALING] Come on. [TIRES SQUEALING] [TIRES SQUEALING] Both gonna die tonight, aren't we? I didn't want this. JANET: Ah, that's what's important, isn't it? What you want or what you don't want. That's what matters to you. You talk about love. You talk about vows. And the only vow you ever made was to yourself. That's enough. I don't care what you say to me anymore. And I don't care what you do to me anymore. But I am telling you right now, you are staying away from April. She's my daughter, Janet. [SHOUTS] She's mine! Nothing you can do can keep me away from her. [HORN HONKING] [TIRES SQUEALING] [TIRES SQUEALING] Carrie! OFFICERS: Freeze! It's all right. It's okay. I'm, uh... I'm Ray Corso with, uh... Called you from the crisis line. I'm with the paper. It's all right. Where are they? They're gone. What, all of them? Yeah. Shoot! Come on, come on, come on! ELEANOR: Women's Crisis Line. It's Ray. Where are they? Getting Janet's daughter. She's with a woman named Kate. And what about Carrie? I don't know. He found the line open and he cut it off. Well, who's Kate? I don't know. Yeah. JANET: I won't let you do this. RICHARD: Shut up! Hello, please help me. WOMAN: Who is it? Let me in! MAN: Hello? Help me. [BUZZING] [JANET SCREAMS] [PRESSING BUTTON FRANTICALLY] [ELEVATOR DINGS] [SCREAMS] Somebody call the police... [MUFFLED YELLING] [SCREAMING] Don't open the door, Kate! [CRYING] [HANDLE RATTLING] [SCREAMING] Come on. Get up. Where are they? [CRIES] I don't know. You don't know? You don't know? [JANET CRYING] You don't know? [SCREAMS] I don't know! April? He'll find us. No, he won't. He will. I know he will. The police are coming. Don't worry, sweetheart. April? [RICHARD MUMBLING] [POLICE SIREN WAILING] Thank God! Don't! [WINCES] Get out there. There's nowhere to run. We're finished running. [SCREAMS] Help! Please help! [SCREAMING] [POLICE SIRENS WAILING] OFFICER: Get those people back. [GASPING] Richard, please! [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] [SCREAMING] Please! Richard, no! Your daughter's in the building. She's downstairs with the police. You said that you would never, ever hurt her. So don't do this. She needs you both. She doesn't need me. CARRIE: You're wrong. You're all she has. Like my father was to me. He killed himself too. They found him in the garage where he hung himself. And everyone told me that it was for the best. That he was sick. That I'd be better off. But when he died, he took away the only family I had left. And what he didn't know, what no one knew, was that I needed him. Even after all he had done, I still needed my father. [INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER] Don't touch me. [CRYING] [CROWD MURMURING] April. Mom. Oh! Thanks. This is my sister, Kate. Hi. And my daughter, April. Who are you? I'm a friend of your mommy's. More than a friend. [CROWD SHOUTING] I'm... I'm sorry. Janet, I'm sorry. [CROWD CLAMORING] Excuse me. [POLICE SIREN WAILING] Are you okay? Yeah. Are you sure? Yeah. Oh, my God. CARRIE: Are you? I feel I aged 10 years in one night. Other than that... Hey, listen, Carrie, Eleanor is on her way to the hospital. A young girl that you counseled named Missy. How is she? I don't know yet. They're working to stop the internal bleeding. Can I go in? I don't know what to say to you, Carrie. I don't think I've ever been so angry with someone I think so highly of. With all the people you helped save tonight, were you able to save yourself? How is she? She's alive, but just barely. A lot's gonna depend on her will to survive. Can I see her? Just for a moment. Missy? It's Carrie. I spoke to you from the crisis line. You're gonna be okay. You are. I'll help you. We'll do it together. You'll see. Carrie, remember, Missy's only 16. But she knew to call. Call twice. She was just too young, too naive to trust her own instincts. We almost caught her. Maybe we'll catch the next one. I'd like to come back, to keep working the lines. As a reporter? As a volunteer. Let me think about it. How about Friday night? [SNIFFLES]
