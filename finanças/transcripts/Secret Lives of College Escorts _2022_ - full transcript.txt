Okay, let's do drinks. - No. - It's my birthday. You have to. Don't post that! What if Coach Ross sees it? She won't. My account's private, friends only. Bottoms up. Fine. - What is that? - It doesn't matter. Let's do another one. Whoa, birthday girl. We have the big game tomorrow. So? What is going on with you? The past few days, you've been acting so weird. What? Now you suddenly just don't care about volleyball? Come on. I think we should go. Oh, can we get another round? How drunk are you? Ooh, party at Beta Psi Kappa. Let's go. This place is lame. You promised we were going to be home by midnight. It's already 1:30 in the morning! We have to get some sleep or Coach is going to kill us! It's fine. Just go back to your dorm. Hey, Monica, come on! Stop. Monica, come on! Hey, stop. Okay. You are so drunk! Monica, this isn't safe for you! Can you just stop for two seconds? No! What are you doing? Where are you going? Monica, stop! This is not safe! Can you come back? Monica, stop. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Monica! My God! No! Someone call 911! Help! Help! Hey, baby. Oh, hey. How you holding up? I'm good... Fine. Oh, my baby. It's all my fault. My best friend is dead because of me. Just listen to me. Blaming yourself is not gonna bring Monica back. Oh, honey. Oh, baby. Hey, kiddo. Hey. It's good to see you, Aunt Melanie. I'm so sorry about Monica. How are you holding up? I don't know. I'm really worried about her. All I want to do is protect her. I know, but you have to give her the freedom to make her own mistakes. What if it had been her that was hit by that car? Man: Eve Baker, you are ineligible to play in any university-sanctioned athletic competition. Because you violated the university's code of ethics prohibiting underage drinking, you are hereby suspended from the volleyball team. Continuing this disciplinary action, your athletic scholarship has also been revoked. Any a further violation will result in your immediate expulsion. Eve, oh, my God! I didn't realize you were back! - Hi. - Hey. How was Monica's service? It was nice. Sad, obviously. But a good way to honor her. Do you want to grab some dinner? No, I'm not that hungry. I lost my scholarship. Wait. What? They can't do that! They can and they did. So now I owe $15,000 in tuition in 10 days. And I have no way to pay it. That's total B.S. What about financial aid or student loans or something? I looked into financial aid, but there are no options until next semester. My mom just doesn't have that kind of money. And my dad's not exactly in the picture... Let's not go there right now. What about getting a job? There's no way I can find a job that pays enough to cover this amount in such a short period of time. Hold on. Have you heard about this? Um, I doubt the university is going to give me another scholarship when they just took mine away. No, the funds aren't for scholarships. It's for equipment and faculty. A whole new biology lab and some other stuff. But this woman who's doing the fundraising campaign looks like she's gonna hire a few students. It says it has a base salary and lucrative bonuses. If you could get this job and show them your hiring contract... maybe they can defer your payment. That actually sounds pretty awesome. It's this woman... Carla Preston? Do you know her? Oh, my gosh! Anyone who wants to work in marketing knows her! I have her book! She's super famous for throwing these massive high-profile galas that raises billions of dollars for charities. She works with celebrities and politicians. But why would she want to do a campaign for the university? Well, she's alumni. Maybe it's a challenge for her. - Shall we call? - Yeah! Do you think she's going to be there? I think so. - Oh... who the hell is that? - Shh! Hello, hello. Welcome, ladies. I'm Liam. Some of you may know me as a Teacher's Assistant, or T.A. from the Economics Department. I'm changing my major. I am cashing in on all those cost benefit analysis lectures to work as one of Miss Preston's talent recruiters. Unfortunately, she's not able to be here today as she's finishing up an event, but I promise you she's gonna be personally watching each and every one of your interview tapes later this evening, okay? They're taping us? Now just something to ease the tension a little bit. If you're sitting here in this room wanting to work for the Carla Preston, then we already know that you love a challenge, right? Now shall we start with the interviews? Tamsen Richards, you're up first. Does she even go to our school? She belongs on a runway. Well, as a former pageant winner, I know exactly what it takes to capture attention and turn potential supporters into lucrative donors. And I have a friend who was one of Carla's girls. So I know exactly what this job entails and I'm up for the challenge. Okay. - Thank you, Tamsen. - Thank you. You know that was quite an event you threw last night. I told you, Warren. I'm good at what I do. Yeah, you are. What if she talks? Like I said, I've handled it. Noted. I still have certain needs that need to be met, if you catch my drift. This time, I want something a little different. You know what I mean? Yes, I do. So you like life on the edge? Absolutely. I get bored easily, so I'm always up for a challenge. Okay, Bryce. I think Ms. Preston's going to be very impressed with you. Well, that went terrible. Okay, last but not least, Eve? Uh, shall we begin? Whenever you're ready. Oh! Okay, I guess I was thinking you'd ask me a question. Okay. Just relax. Breathe, okay? You can talk about whatever you want to talk about, okay? This job has nothing to do with your GPA, it has everything to do with your personality. That's all we want to see. - Okay. - Okay? Okay. Okay... Hi, I'm Eve Baker. I've followed Carla... Miss Preston's career for years. Ever since I read her book. Why I found her so inspiring is because in her book she tells the story of her father and how he disappeared from her life. I can unfortunately relate to that. I guess what I want to say is I would do whatever it takes to get this job. As Carla says, "Everyone has talent, but most people don't have the courage." I'm brave enough to handle whatever she throws at me. Okay. Eve, we'll be in touch. So much for that. I'm going to be so late for class. Oh, my mom is calling me. Do you mind if I run ahead? - Of course, it's okay. - Okay, I'll see you there. Hey, mom. Hey, honey. I just got a copy of your tuition bill. Yeah, I know. I saw. I already screwed up my chance to play volleyball. I'm not losing the opportunity to be at college, too. Just let me figure it out. Okay, but how are we going to pay for you to stay there? I just interviewed for a job. Oh, yeah? What job? It's in fundraising for our university and it's really good pay. If I get an employment contract, maybe they'll let me defer my tuition. Sweetie, we owe $15,000 and that's just for the semester. I know, Mom, but at least let me try. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow night, Mom. Love you. Okay. I love you. Hello? Eve, this is Isabella calling from Preston Enterprises. Hi. I watched all your interviews and I think you have real potential. Really? I mean, that's great! Thank you. Did you get the job? We'd like to see you at our office 8 a.m. sharp. Yeah, sure. Thank you. See you then. Oh, my God! Eve, this is huge! Okay. Well, hold on. I don't know if I got the job yet. They didn't say that I was hired, and maybe they'll call you next. That's very optimistic of you. But I completely botched that interview. I'm sorry. It's totally fine, really. I'm so happy for you. Oh, my God! It's Carla Preston! - It's Carla! - You got it. It's Carla! I like these selections. Liam found them all. It certainly helps to have a teachers assistant scouting from inside the university. Let me see my new girls. Oh, right. So these are our final picks. Tamsen seems to already know the deal. And Bryce has an old account on a dating site that matches married men to young women. So she shouldn't be an issue. Right. She'll probably see this as an upgrade. Exactly. And then there's Eve. She is gonna be our golden ticket. She's innocent, fresh. Kind of like you when you came to work for me 10 years ago. This girl, Eve. I think clients will love that she's new to this. Jax Thomas. Owns the building our offices are located in. Also owns several pieces of prime real estate all in downtown L.A. Oh, and I love our new building. It's way more hip than on the west side and closer to our clients' in the financial district. Maybe Eve is exactly what he's looking for. Isabella, these are our ladies. Hello. Have a seat. Ladies, this is Isabella. Thank you, Liam. Of course. I am the Vice President of Preston Enterprises. Tamsen Richards, Bryce Watson, Eve Baker. You were the lucky three. Welcome to the team. Consider this your trial period. This is a freelance position, though we do offer a flat rate of $1,500 a week to get you started. But where you'll earn your real money is in your bonus. For every donor you close, you get a 5% commission. Each of you will be meeting your clients soon. You'll want to learn as much about their profession before you meet them. You'll want to entertain them. But I want you to think elevated conversation. Eve, you have Jax Thomas, hedge fund manager and real estate investor. Better brush up on your finance knowledge. What about us? We haven't assigned your contributors yet. Tamsen and Bryce, why don't you head down to my office? It's just right down the hall. Just so you know, Eve, I'm personally very excited to have you join the team. Thanks. So I'm just supposed to study this information about, uh... Mr. Thomas? Exactly. Don't be nervous. You're gonna be amazing. Oh, I have something for you. This is an original paperback copy of Carla's second book. It was her personal copy that she read while on her global press tour. I remember from your interview that you're a big fan. I had Carla sign it for you. Oh, my gosh, thank you so much. Of course. You're so welcome. And, again, we're really excited to have you. - Yeah, definitely those two, - I love these. - For sure. - Okay, good. I like them, too. Okay. Hey, Mom. Oh, hey, Aunt Melanie! Hi, cutie! Hi! Yeah, I'm gonna help your mom do a little staging. - The house is really big. - It's huge. You seem very happy. Well, I'm glad you're both here because I have good news. I got the job! - Oh, baby! - Yes! Congratulations! What job? I wanna know. Fill me in. It's in fundraising for the school. I'm working for this amazing woman, Carla Preston. She wrote my favorite book. Oh, and get this. They're paying me $1,500 a week. And then for every donor I get, they give me a 5% commission! Whoa! Yeah, wow. That's an awful lot of money for a fundraising gig. This isn't selling cookies at a bake sale to raise cash. I mean, I'm asking people to donate a lot of money, like hundreds of thousands of dollars. Okay, and how do you do that? I mean, do you knock on doors? Do you make phone calls? I don't know everything yet, Mom. I just got the job. Training starts tomorrow. Aren't you at least happy for me? Yes, of course, I am, but that kind of money seems a little too good to be true. Why do you always have to be so skeptical? Hey, I'm not trying to be. I just... I worry that you're not gonna have enough time for your schoolwork. But without volleyball, I have more free time. Okay, okay, you two. Stop arguing. We are very happy for you, Eve. Thanks, Melanie. Yes. We are very happy for you. I'm very proud of you and I love you very much. Love you, too. Now will you please come help us? - Okay. - Okay. I hate that you call me as soon as your wife leaves. You treat me like I'm one of Carla's girls. Come on, babe. You know that's not true. I love you. And one day, we're not gonna have to sneak around anymore. You've been saying that for a year. We're getting closer. I talked to a divorce lawyer today. Really? So you coming over or what? I'll be right there. "Ladies Man"? "He's often spotted out at area hot spots with an up and coming fashion model on his arm." Hello? Man: Serena Paulson, I hope you've kept your mouth shut. Nice red jacket. Please, I promise. I haven't said a word to anybody. If you ever do, you know what happens next. You should be more careful, Serena. Are you sure you want to open that door? So, ladies, one billion dollars. That is our goal. And we are not going to hit that number if we're asking for donations only from alumni. We need to connect people outside the university. I'm talking your venture capitalists, your billionaire hedge fund managers, real estate moguls, people behind-the-scenes with real money. Most of them don't even want the fanfare and prefer the anonymity. Sorry. So here's the plan. One epic event six weeks from now. Your goal is to start securing donations from your high-income contributors before the event. This way, by the time they attend, you've earned their trust enough that they fully open their wallets and give a much larger donation. Speaking of, when do I get to meet my client? We're not getting any donations just sitting around here. We haven't made the final selections for you and Bryce yet. All right, that's it for today. You can leave. Eve, is everything okay? Um, my mom's been trying to reach me. I'll let you check on her. Actually, I had a couple questions. Okay? I was wondering if there was some kind of job contract. I really want to try and get my tuition payment for school deferred. And it would help if I can show proof of income. Well, we don't do any formal type of paperwork for these positions because they are freelance. Oh... But if you're having issues with your tuition, how much do you need to cover payment? It's a lot. Okay. Give me a number. $15,000. Let me see if there's anything I can do. Really? Thank you. I'm sure that if you could just give me proof of employment, that would help. Anything else? Yeah. I did some research on Mr. Thomas. Uh, Jax. There was an article that talked about him being a bit of a womanizer? Ignore that. It's nothing but gossip. Jax is one of the most upstanding businessmen in this city. Oh, come. Eve, is it? Isabella's told me wonderful things about you. We're so happy to have you on the team. Thank you. I'm so grateful to be here. I should get to work. Hope everything's okay with your mom. Hey, Mom. I'm on my way back to campus right now. See you soon. So we're selling seats to the gala starting at $50,000 up to $150,000 per couple. These are the invites I had made. Aren't they fabulous? Yeah. Do you think these girls are capable of selling $150,000 seats? That's more than any previous girl we've had. I think Eve can. She just needs some time. There might be a way too speed things up. She's having issues with her tuition. No better way to gain a girl's trust quickly than to make her indebted, right? You taught me that. Who is that? Antonio. Aw, Isabella, I don't know why you bother with that man when there are tons of other eligible bachelors. He's leaving his wife. They all say that. Can we get back to work? Yeah. These look fabulous. I'm telling you, this place is pretty magical. - It is, it's beautiful. - It is. No, seriously, thank you so much for lunch, Mom. But I told you I can handle this. I know, but I know how much you love this place. I just... I wanna figure out a way to let you stay here. Oh, I thought you wanted me to go community college. I want you to be happy. All right, come on. Let's figure out a way to keep you here. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Can I help you? We're here to discuss options about deferring tuition payment. - Name? - Eve Baker. I'm her mother. The tuition has already been paid for the remainder of the semester. What? That has to be a mistake. No, it's been paid. Well, does it say who paid it? It says "Payee Anonymous". Who would have made a $15,000 payment in your name? I mean, who knew about this issue besides us? I mean, the only people who knew are you, me, Melanie, Shiann... and Isabella from work. Do you think this could be somebody from your job? Maybe it was a mistake. Well, if it was a mistake, then they're gonna find out about it. We should probably have them look into it. Mom, just let me figure it out myself, please? Okay, baby. I love you. Okay. Bye. Hey, Isabella, it's Eve Baker. I just had a question about my school tuition. Can you call me as soon as you get this? Thanks. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. Why are you sending me to voicemail? Hey, girl. You look hot. I was gonna ask if you wanted to study together tonight. But it looks like you have plans. I'm going to meet someone from work. But the weirdest thing happened today. I went go find out how to deter my tuition payment and they said someone already paid it. What? Who? I don't know. I have this weird suspicion it could be my new job. But why would they take care of my tuition? I told my boss about it and then an hour later, it was just magically paid. Maybe it's a signing bonus or something? Pretty generous bonus. - Yeah. - $15,000? I haven't even done any actual work. Well, they must have a good reason if they're willing to spend that kind of money. I don't know... But I'm gonna find out. So my tuition payment was paid in full and I don't know who did it. Do you know how that happened? Well, the company offers a small number of student scholarships every year. I was able to pull some strings and take care of it immediately. Wow, my God! That's incredible! Thank you. No, seriously, my pleasure. You remind me so much of myself when I was younger. Wait. How so? Well, like you, I was an athlete. Really? And also like you, I lost my scholarship. Oh, my God, that sucks. I'm so sorry. No, don't be. It was a blessing. 'Cause right after that, I met Carla. Wait. You met her when you were in college? I was your age. Carla just turned 30 and became a multi-millionaire and they did this whole TV news special on her. It was great. Oh, my God, I think I watched it a few years ago online. - You did? - Yeah. - It was incredible. - So good. - This is fun. - Yeah. - We should order. - Yeah. We actually have to get going. I have a meeting to get to. Really? But we just got here. What about the check? Right. Don't worry. Carla has a tab here. They'll charge it to the company account. Come on. How was your dinner with Eve tonight? We ran into Jax with one of his work colleagues. But I think I was able to get her out of there in time before he saw her. Hm. Well, that's good news. Eve definitely needs to be more thoroughly debriefed on the nature of her job. Isabella... Unfortunately, I have some bad news for you. Okay. Well, Antonio called me this evening. He's still interested in donating to the university project. However, he's also interested in seeing one of the new girls. Yeah, right. You know how these men are. Tell him no. Isabella, this is business. I'm not going to turn down revenue because of you. But we're together! He's a married man and you met him through my business. You're not the first woman he's enjoyed on the side and you certainly won't be the last. No, he can't do this to me. Isabella, I am doing you a favor by calling you and giving you a heads up. You're smart enough to not fall for men like Antonio. Carla, he's leaving his wife for me. Stop it. Just stop it! You know, you sound like an unhinged school girl! Okay, you know what? If you want Antonio so badly, why don't you pitch him a threesome with one of the girls? Maybe that'll keep his interest. Clearly, you alone can't. You're right. I'll just deal with it. Good. I'm glad you've come to your senses. I'll see you in the office tomorrow. Hopefully, you will have moved past this. Okay? Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. Okay, Bryce? Tamsen? I finally have your contributor targets ready. Finally. Bryce, you have Warren Richter, tech billionaire. And Tamsen has... Who is it? Woo! Antonio Rossi! Doesn't he own Michelin starred restaurants all over the world? - That's hot. - Oh, yeah, that is. Isn't he married? Girls, try to be a little bit more professional! I thought our job was to entertain these guys. Your job is to impress them so they donate. You need your brains to accomplish that. Whatever. You can all be excused... Except Eve. Are you okay? I'm fine. You'll be meeting with your client Jax tonight at seven. Tonight? But I have class later and I really have to study. Eve, I know this is last minute, but I also know you're grateful for the scholarship I was able to get for you. Yeah. I used to juggle work and school too. So I'm confident you can as well. Besides, this is a new donor. And if you want my advice, it would look really bad if you cancel this meeting. School will always be there, but if your dream is to work for Carla, you should make this a priority. I have work to do. Um... I'll be in touch. Yeah. You know what? I have to call you back. You don't knock? Tamsen? You gave Tamsen Antonio! I didn't. He requested her. Why are we having this conversation? I thought we worked this out last night. There are three new girls. He chose her. Why am I wasting another breath on this? Carla, we're friends. Okay. You and I are friendly. You work for me, Isabella, and I do not appreciate this behavior from you, especially not from someone I promoted to be the Vice President of my company! This conversation ends here, understood? Hey, Mom. Hey, honey, any word on the tuition payment? Yeah. So my work actually ended up paying for it. I'm sorry. Your job just covered $15,000? I know, Mom, but my boss was explaining that it's actually a company scholarship program. They give a few of them away every year just to support their employees. Okay. Did you apply for this? No. Well, what was their selection process like? I don't know, Mom, okay? You don't have to question everything that happens to me all the time. I gotta go, okay? I love you. Eve? That's the one. I don't know... You look stunning! You don't think it's too much? In this job, it's all about projecting a certain image. You have to convince some of the wealthiest people in the world to donate money. This dress is perfect. Is something wrong? Isabella, are you okay? I'm so sorry. I have to go. I have a personal emergency. Okay, just let me change back into my... There's no time for that! Is there anything I can do to help? No. Um, just focus on your meeting. Sorry. In case you need a different pair of shoes, here's the company card. Okay. You're gonna be amazing. Hey, it's okay. Now go, go. What the hell are you doing here? Are you crazy, coming to my work? You lied to me. Isabella, we knew that this had an expiration date on it. Come on, we had our fun. Our fun? You said that you loved me! You wasted my time telling me that you're leaving your wife! Did you even call a divorce lawyer? It's just something that people say in the moment. Come on! We're adults here! You told me... You get it? This is what we do! We live out our fantasy for a brief time. You didn't actually think this was real, did you? We're very different people, you and I. No, we're not! We're not! Shh! Shh! Moving forward, I'm just looking for someone... I don't know, someone... Someone younger? I have to get to a meeting. You mean you're gonna have sex with your new little slut! Isabella, this conversation is over... and so are we. No! Wait, wait. Wait. You look good. Oh, thank you. Hey, Mom. Hi, sweetie. Well, you look all dressed up. Yeah, I have work tonight. Hm, it's very fancy. Mom... I'm just calling about my birthday. It's gonna be the usual suspects, just Mel, some of our favorite people, tacos, cake. Sounds fun. So how is the new job going? It's good. I'm meeting my first client tonight. It's no big deal, early drinks. Drinks? I'm not going to be drinking. He will. He? Okay, baby, I'm trying to be supportive here. I looked online and there's nothing about a scholarship on the website. Maybe it's not something she wants to be public, Mom. She doesn't need to brag about all the money she gives away for good causes. Okay. Just... be careful. I will. I'm running late. I have to go. - I love you. - I love you. I can see this being a very interesting working relationship. Do you? So I've been told you pledged $50,000 already. You've been told correct. What would you say to donating another $50,000? Well, I'd have to ask what are you gonna do for me? I think you are proving to be very good at your work, Tamsen. So, does that mean you're gonna be opening your checkbook tonight? That's very possible. I think we need a bit more privacy. Thanks. Excuse me, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Hi. Miss Preston, I thought I was meeting Mr. Thomas. You are. Have a seat. And, please, call me Carla. Okay. Since Isabella abandoned you earlier in what I suppose was some sort of personal emergency, I need to debrief you on your meeting tonight. Okay. Jax is one of our new contributors. He's already donated $20,000 to the university fundraising campaign. Wow, that's a lot of money. I'd like to double that contribution and eventually get him up to $150,000. $150,000? Think of this as building a relationship. Tonight I just want you to make casual conversation. Don't even bring up money at all. Understand? Good. I have a lot of faith in you, Eve. It's okay to be nervous your first time. Makes you more endearing. I'm gonna head out before Jax comes. When that waiter arrives, order him a scotch, neat. Whiskey neat. I thought we promised in marriage counseling there'd be no phones after work. Uh, just give me a second. It's important. Eve! Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a nightmare. It's really nice to meet you. You too, Mr. Thomas. Please call me Jax. I ordered you a whiskey neat. I hope that was okay. Oh, it's more than okay. Perfect selection. So I read in the headline today that there was a merger between Los Angeles Bank and Chartoff Bank. That's a big deal, right? Do you really wanna talk about mergers and acquisitions? Because I discuss them all day long. So I'd like to talk about something else. Okay, sure, yeah. Okay, so how about have you ever fantasized about changing your first name and, if so, to what? That's what you want to know? Really? Yeah. You know, my sister, she bought me this book for my birthday: 100 questions to spark a real conversation. That was question number one. Okay. I have fantasized about changing it. I want my name to be something simple like Mary or Jennifer. Too many Adams and Eves and apple jokes start to weigh on a girl after a while. What about you? I don't know. I was more interested in your answer. That's not fair. Come on! My reputation's at stake here. My family could be destroyed! If this gets out, you will be exposed, too. Relax. I will handle it. Thank you. You know, I was nervous to meet you. Why? Because I'm guessing things like this can get a bit awkward at first. Truthfully, you're my first meeting like this... ever. Really? Hmm And, honestly, you're nothing like I imagined. Well, hopefully, that's a good thing! Yeah. Yeah, Carla mentioned that you were new. So I'm just glad that I was able to meet you. Me, too. To meetings. And to, hopefully, many more. Sorry. It's just a friend checking on me. Ah, someone wanting to know all the riveting gossip about our dinner? No. She wants to see if I can study tonight. Well, what are you studying? Calculus. Not my strongest subject. - Really? - Yeah. Well, lucky for you, you're having dinner with someone who lives and breaths limits, derivatives and integrals. But I promise, it's not as boring as it sounds. Well, I'm sure you don't wanna spend your evening helping some college student study. Come on. Hit me with your best question. Where do I start? Okay. I'm really confused on the application of indefinite integrals. Okay. That's a good one, that's a good one. So get ready to have your mind blown. - Blown? Really? - Yeah, blown. Oh, I don't think math can blow my mind, but go. Do your worst, okay. - Here we go. - Okay. Oh! Shh... Where's her phone? Oh, I forgot. What's that? Isabella's day planner. She must put it in my bag by mistake. Totally forgot I had it. I was so distracted by my meeting with Jax. I should text her. Oh, my gosh. What's up? I just got a bank deposit of $3,000. What? Girl, the way you've been attracting money lately. Please send some of that magic over to me. Oh, hold on. - Hello? - Eve? It's Carla. I wanted to personally congratulate you on a very successful first meeting. You landed a huge donation. I did? Jax was very impressed with you. By the way, your bonus should be in your bank account. And he wants to see you again tomorrow night. Tomorrow? My mom's birthday is tomorrow. And I'm gonna be in Santa Clarita to celebrate. Eve, let me explain something to you. When a contributor wants to see you again, it usually means that he's gonna donate again. We can't afford to pass on these opportunities. We've invested in you by paying for your tuition. And in return, we expect that you will invest in your work here. Of course. I'll be there. Wonderful. We'll get you all the details you need. Hi. Hey, Eve, how was your night? Good. Jax was really sweet. Mm, so was Antonio. Sweet and rich. Sounds like you had a fun night. We actually had another meeting this morning. I can't believe Antonio and Isabella slept together. Isn't she like 40? What? Antonio told me that he and Isabella had a one night stand like, a year ago. I thought you said he was married. I mean, yeah, but he's a really successful guy, you know. Someone like him is never going to be satisfied by just one woman. Anyway, I guess Isabella's mad that I was with him last night. Why would she be mad? I mean, he's your client. Yeah, that's why she would be mad. Hey! Did you guys hear what happened? - No. What? - Isabella! She's dead! What? Oh, my God! Someone broke into her home and attacked her last night. I can't believe this. Isabella was such a good person! She wasn't that good. What is that supposed to mean? Tamsen, don't. What? I'm not gonna act like she was some saint just because she's dead. Oh, geez! I'm sorry! What are you doing here? Well, I'm still a T.A. here. I mean at least until the semester ends. Right. Did you hear what happened to Isabella? Carla just told me. It's awful. I didn't know what to say. Are you okay? It's okay, sit down. Sit down. Breathe, breathe. Sorry. I think I'm gonna be sick. No, that's all right. You have nothing to apologize for, right? You didn't do anything wrong. - Just breathe. - I'm sorry. Just... Isabella is the second friend I lost in a matter of weeks. That's right, Monica. How did you know? Oh, I read about it in the school paper. She was the girl that died in the hit and run, right? Wait. How did you know we were friends? I was a T.A. in one of her classes. She'd just always talk about her best friend, Eve. Wait. Did you know who I was when I interviewed with you? No, no, no. I just put two and two together recently. Carla tells me that you have another meeting with Jax tonight? Yeah. Look, I don't know if I can handle that right now. After Isabella, I think I just need to go home to my mom. Yeah, yeah. I totally get that. Hey, you know what? Why don't I reach out and see if Jax could do coffee this afternoon instead? This way, you could head right out to your mother's afterwards. Sound like a plan? Yeah, okay. I'll be there. All right. You're gonna be okay, all right? I'll see you later. Thank you. You know, I have a vacation house not far from him in Palm Springs. A lot of my friends live there as well. It's a whole community of wealthy influential people. We're having a gala there in a few weeks and I'd love for you to accompany me. You want me to go away with you... to your vacation house? Yes, but there's an entire guest quarters. You'd have complete privacy and you'd have your own entrance to come and go as you please. I'm sorry. Was that too much to ask? I just wasn't expecting it. Eve, look. I'm just gonna come out and say it. You know, I really just enjoy your company. Thanks, but I just... Just has a really terrible day. I don't... I don't think I can think about that right now. What happened? Eve, it's okay. You can talk to me. So my best friend died last month. And I just found out that another friend was killed last night. God, what? Who died last night? Isabella, the Vice President at Preston Enterprises. She was killed. Eve, I had no idea. I never would have asked to meet had I known about all of that. I appreciate that. Look, I really just want to go home. I'm so sorry. I don't mean to cut this meeting short. Of course, of course. Thank you for understanding. Sure, sure, go home. Okay. Hey, honey, what's going on with you? You've been quiet all night. I'm just really tired, Mom. - It's the job, isn't it? - Mom, please... Okay, honey, I know that you don't want to hear this. But I was looking online and everything I could find looks like your entire job is just the nightlife scene. Look, Mom, hosting events is part of our job. Okay. Well, looks like they get pretty wild. I mean, this photo was from, what, two weeks ago? Oh, my God... Monica. Eve? Eve, what is it? I've had a really stressful day and I wanna be alone, okay? I'm going to my room. Hey, Eve, is everything okay? Monica knew Carla. Maybe she even worked for her. What? Yeah, she's in this photo from a company party. Oh, my God. And you know that guy, Liam? The guy who interviewed us? Yeah. I talked to him earlier. He mentioned that I was friends with Monica. And when I asked him how he knew that, he said it was because he was her teacher's assistant. Why wouldn't he just say he knew about our friendship because they were at the same company? Why wouldn't Monica tell me she worked for Carla? Maybe she had a reason not to tell you the truth. I don't know, Shiann. This just doesn't add up. Eve took off very upset earlier. Why would you set up a date after what happened to Isabella? Now, honestly, I'm surprised that you're even here meeting with me after what happened. Jax, you know my contributors always come first. She was your Vice President, correct? Yes. Yes, she was and I'm mourning in my own way. I did tell her that she could cancel the date with you today, but she insisted on seeing you. Well, she certainly didn't seem like she wanted to be there. Listen, I never want anyone to feel pressured or uncomfortable. That's not who I am. You do get that, right? Of course. Jax, I can reassure you Eve is really interested in you. She's just going through a tough time. And she's shy. She needs to warm up, like we discussed. Just be patient. Serena Paulson... Maybe you have some answers. Monica! No! - You are so drunk. - Stop! It's fine. Monica, come back! Come on! What are you doing? Where are you going? This is not safe! Monica... I'm sorry. Damn it! Oh, my God. I forgot I had this. Isabella went on vacation with him? I thought Tamsen said they just had a one-night stand a year ago. Seems more serious than one night. Hey, Shi. Okay, so I decided to play detective last night and I was able to track down Monica's old school schedule. Liam was definitely not a teacher's assistant in any of her classes. So he was lying? Yep. The question still is... why? I mean, Monica was my best friend. She never... I don't know, kept secrets from me. Maybe she was involved with one of the clients? Honestly, when you told me about your meeting with Jax, it sounded more like a date. I didn't even tell you yet. He asked me to go on vacation with him to his Palm Springs house. There you go! What if one of the clients propositioned Monica in the same way and she said yes? Maybe. I don't know. I just really think Monica would tell me about that. Unless... A client offered her money for sex. Like a sugar baby or an escort? I mean, she always knew that she could confide in me about anything and I would never judge her. I mean, at least I hope she knew that. There anything else I can do to help? No. I need to track down this other girl who worked for Carla. Look, all I know is that my best friend and Isabella are dead just weeks apart. And they're both connected to Carla. Now I am, too. I need to figure out what happened to them before anyone else dies, including me. I'm so sick of waiting. She's a hair stylist. Daniel Jordan Salon. 1238 Chestnut Street in Los Angeles. Next appointment with Serena, 12:30. Perfect. If you won't reply to me, I'll come to you. Hey, sweetie. Whoa! Are you okay? I didn't even hear you come in. Honey, what's going on with you? You know you can talk to me, right? Yeah, I just have this big project for school. I need to head back. Well, hey, did you forget that it's my birthday weekend? We were gonna have dinner, maybe get some mani-pedis. I love you so much. I'm so sorry. And I promise I'm gonna make it up to you, okay? Love you. No, no. Eve, I really... I don't want you going anywhere! I really don't like that you're doing this job. Why? Well, for one thing, that woman, Carla, seems to have made her entire business centered around partying at nightclubs with very rich men and very young women. Why? 'Cause you saw one picture online from a company party? You're overreacting. No, no. Hey, I don't think that I am. Listen, I don't want to envision you hanging over some rich guy drunk at a party and have that be your job. I know that you're 19 and that you think that you have everything figured out. But trust me, you don't! Mom, enough is enough. Just let me live my life! You have great hair. Thanks. You know, you look so familiar. Oh, yeah? I think you used to work for the same company I'm with now. Do you used to work at Preston Enterprises? I really can't talk about this. Monica was my best friend, okay? She was killed six weeks ago and I have to... My next client is here. I have to go. Serena... Serena knew something. I could tell. What are you gonna do? I know she gets off work at eight. I'll just go and wait outside and make her talk to me. And if she doesn't? That's not an option. Where are you going? I know all of this connects. I can feel it. But why Monica and Isabella were killed, I can't figure it out. And I refuse to go to sleep tonight until I know the truth. Tamsen, are you even listening? Antonio and Isabella were not a one-night stand. They went on vacation together and they were definitely seeing each other for a lot longer than that. Okay. So? You don't think it's weird that he lied to you? No, Eve. Why would I care who Antonio was with before me? Well, did he tell you anything else about Isabella? We don't exactly do a lot of talking. Tamsen, please, okay? Isabella is dead. This isn't funny. He may have mentioned she was kind of clingy, you know, like a kind of crazy woman that would go home and tell your wife. Why do you want to know all this anyway? You interested in Antonio? Yes, but not in the way you think. What are you doing here? I really need your help. What? Look, Serena, I don't wanna cause you any trouble. But Monica was my best friend, okay? I have to know what happened to her! I can't say. So you do know? Did it have to do with Carla, or Monica's clients or whatever? Wait. She told you about Warren? Wait. Who's Warren? That name sounds so familiar. Please... Serena, if this guy had any... I cannot tell you this, it's gonna put you in danger, too. I don't care, okay? I need to know what happened to my best friend! Fine, fine. Warren was Monica's client. He's supposedly some big tech billionaire. Wait. Oh, I think he's seeing Bryce. Well, you should tell here to watch her back then because he's into some really shady business. Like what? All I know is that Warren was at a hotel suite with Monica and she overheard him on the phone with Carla discussing some illegal business transaction. Warren caught her eavesdropping and it was really bad. He had his car drive her home right away and she called me crying. She was so scared of what was gonna happen to her. The next day was her birthday. That's the night she died, I was there with her. I know. I wish there was something I could have done to help her. I didn't think they were gonna kill her. Did you ever go to the police? No. I was so scared they wouldn't believe me. And if Carla found out that I went to the police, I would be dead, too. But this secret has just been... been eating me alive. We have to do something. For Monica and Isabella and everybody else Carla has destroyed. - Hey, you. - Hi. - How are you? - I'm good. How are you? Good. Your house is gorgeous, wow. Yeah. Hard work certainly pays off. I have to know. How did the test go? You aced it, right? Test? Test, yeah, great. So much has happened. Yeah, it went really well. Yeah, I was even teaching my roommate half the stuff you told me. She was so impressed. Yes, yes, I like that, I like that. Um... Can I get you anything? Water, tea, Coke? - I'm fine, thanks. - Okay. Right this way. I have to say that I'm surprised that you wanted to meet, especially here in the home. You're a good guy, right? I'm certainly not a saint, but generally speaking, I like to think I'm a good person. I need to be able to trust you. Eve, you're worrying me. Her name's Monica. I've seen her before. I believe I met her at one of Carla's events. She was my best friend and she was killed exactly six weeks ago. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, Eve. Don't you find it strange that two women who worked for Carla both ended up dead just weeks apart? Yeah, I do. How long have you known Carla? A few years. I believe that she's the one responsible for Monica's death. Maybe, Isabella's too. She's not that woman we thought she was. Did you go to the police? I don't have enough evidence yet. But if Carla figures out what I'm trying to do - and then I can end up... - Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. So what do you wanna do? How can I help? I can't believe this. I have to prove it to the police, but it's not going to be easy. And if it doesn't work... Let's not even go there. Jax and I are planning something in a few days. He's meeting with Carla tomorrow. Hopefully, she takes the bait, A book party, huh? Yes, to celebrate the release before it comes out. Just an intimate event for your highest contributors. I want to celebrate you. Oh, Jax, what do I owe this gesture to? I just wanna thank you for connecting me to Eve. She's really, really special. I knew you would like her. In fact, I've been trying to reach her all morning. Have you heard from her? She's staying with me. Really? I'm pleased that things have progressed. We're having a great time together. In fact, I'm taking her away for a few days. But we'll be back just in time for the party. Next Saturday work for you? I'll clear my calendar. Perfect. Hey, how'd it go? She doesn't suspect a thing and agreed to the book party. Thank God! Oh, my gosh. I'm heading to your vacation house right now. Thank you. For everything. Oh, don't thank me just yet. Now we still need to pull this off. Oh my gosh, wow. Look at this! Antonio, good to see you, brother. Welcome everyone, welcome, welcome. Great place. - Thanks. - Thank you. Thank you. I'm freaking out. Can I just come there and help? No! That would just raise an alarm, okay? We cannot risk Carla thinking anything is wrong. Oh, okay. Please just call and tell me what's happening as soon as you can. I will. Ah, there she is. That's Warren. Jax, my old friend. Good to see you. Yeah, good to see you too, Warren. Who's this lovely? This is Eve. Eve. Aren't you lucky? Can you believe this place? What do these people do? Don't know. I hope the girl is right about this. I wouldn't be here if I thought it was a waste of time. And I have camped out in worst places. Miss Baker! What are you doing here? Hi, Shiann. Is Eve home? Uh, no. She's not. Can I come in for a moment? Yeah, sure. Ladies and gentlemen, may I please have your attention? The one and only Carla Preston. Thank you. Thank you all for coming this afternoon. Thank you to Jax Thomas for throwing this wonderful event which I think was a bit last-minute. I am truly honored to stand amongst you, my friends and colleagues and very generous donors. I'd like to now read a passage from my new book. It's one that resonates deeply with me and I think it reminds us why we're all here today. I'm sure Eve told you about our little fight? She didn't tell me anything. Wait, honey, honey, are you okay? Ms. Baker, I'm really scared for Eve. Shiann, I need you to tell me where my daughter is right now, okay? "If there's one thing I've learned as an entrepreneur, "it is that success is not defined "by your bank account or status, "but by the impact you leave on the world. "Making a difference with people and the planet goes much farther than profit." Carla, before you continue, I have a question. Well, yes, Eve. What is it? I'm a big fan of yours, as I'm sure everyone in this room is. You talk a lot in your new book about making an impact with your work. Yes. Yes, that's right. Does that extend to your other business ventures? I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Would you consider what happened to Isabella making an impact? Well, what happened to Isabella is a terrible tragedy that I had nothing to do with. But we're still deeply saddened by her loss. So I'm not sure I understand your question. Hmm, okay. Then maybe we should ask Mr. Rossi. You were dating Isabella before she was killed, right? Is that true? No. It's all right here. She's got your dates marked, your vacation. What I do in my life is none of your business. It is when the person is my friend and she was murdered! I'm curious. How did Isabella feel when he started seeing Tamsen? These questions are ridiculous. What's your point, Eve? The point is that Isabella is dead because of him. How dare you insinuate I had anything to do with her death? So does this mean that the cops already questioned you? No. Why would they? If they knew you were having a long-time affair with Isabella and ended things right before she was killed, I'm sure they'd find it pretty interesting that your mistress just happened to end up dead. This is insane. Don't worry. I already told the police everything. I'm sure they're on their way to your house right now to question you. I didn't do anything! Carla told me she would take care of Isabella. I had no idea she would end up dead! I don't need this drama. He's so not worth it. Okay, no one believes her. She's clearly lost her mind. So, Eve, I think you have embarrassed yourself enough with these absolutely ridiculous accusations. Jax, will you please have security remove this girl? She's not going anywhere! And neither am I. Because everyone here needs to know what you've done. Most of you don't know me. My name is Serena. I used to work for Carla. I was one of her girls, as she would say. A few months ago, a new girl came to work for her. Her name was Monica Gomez. Something wrong? One night she called me in tears. She was at a hotel with her client, Warren, and she overheard a phone call. That is enough, Serena! No. No, I have stayed silent about this long enough. You were on the phone, Warren, discussing some illegal business transaction and Monica overheard! Serena, I would be very careful where you are going with this. She was so terrified about what might happen to her and the next night, she was murdered! Oh, that's some coincidence! Monica has an issue with a client and ends up dead. Isabella has an issue with another client and she's killed too! Who's next, Carla? Me? Serena? What? Both of us? Please excuse these very childish outbursts. Luckily, this is a room that values discretion. I'll will deal with this. Oh, how are you gonna deal with that, Carla, with us? Please, tell everybody. Is this true? I think I'm going to be sick. Okay, let's clear the air. Thank you, Warren. I mean, we all know what's going on here. Carla here is running an escort service. - Oh my God. - And that's fine. What? Listen, if we have a problem with a girl, we just go to Carla. I had a girl that was checking into my personal private business affairs and I went to Carla. She took care of it. It's as simple as that. I never asked her to murder anybody. And my colleague, Antonio, didn't either. This is just Carla's way, My hands are clean. You ungrateful bastards! After everything I have done for you. Yes, I handle things using any means necessary to provide excellent service to you! That is why I am standing up here and you are all in the crowd congratulating me! - LAPD! Nobody leaves the room! - Police! Everybody freeze! What the hell is going on? Hold it right there. Liam Turner, you're under arrest. They were listening in the whole time from the other room. Carla Preston, you are under arrest. You handle things. So do we. You think you're so smart, don't you? Halt! - Freeze! - Halt! Stop her! Oh... let's get out of here. No need for back-up. Ma'am, this is a crime scene. Let me through, that's my daughter! - Oh... - Oh, my baby! Oh, my baby! Oh my God. We were so worried. - I'm so sorry. - No, no, no. It's fine. I just care that you're okay. Are you okay? I'm sorry, I know I wasn't supposed to say anything. - It's okay. - I'm so sorry. I'm not mad, I'm not mad. - Hello. - Hi! There's my straight A student. I have some other good news. Hmm? I got that internship for next semester! Babe! Congratulations. That's amazing! Who's the internship with? It's in marketing for this new investment firm. The owner, Jax, has become a good mentor for me. I'm so proud of you. Can you believe it? My girl's all grown up. She is.
