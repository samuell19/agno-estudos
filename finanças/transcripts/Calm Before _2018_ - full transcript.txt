- And? - It's the storyteller. - So, I'm at this uh, total hole in the wall, right? With uh some, some trash band playing, that I don't know, disappeared after the 90s. I don't even know what someone like Gia was doing at a show like this, but, there she was standing in the middle of this giant mosh pit. - I have no idea. - So I remember looking down at her thinking, "Who is this chick?" Right? Total girl of my dreams. And then, the music starts playing. Right? And all these dudes, mohawks, tattoos. I mean, I, I was afraid of 'em. They start to jump in all over the place and, and, and, like, doing their mosh thing, right? So, so I figured, well, why not? I uh, wrapped one leg around Gia's foot. Boom. Down she goes. - No. - Yeah, her sandal goes flying halfway across the room. - Oh, I felt like the whole room was looking at me. I wanted to stand up, but I sprained my ankle in the fall. So, Shane here spends the whole night apologizing to me in the ER, and then went back to the club to find my shoe. - That kinda sounds like Cinderella. Oh. - I knocked her down and then um, she became my wife. Huh? - That's better than knocking her up. - Sweetheart. To the most perfect couple we know. - Oh, cheers. - We are absolutely thrilled to be here to celebrate with you two. To 13 years, and many, many more. - Thank you, my dear. - Thank you. - Sorry I'm late. - Oh, hey pal. Hi. - Great to see you, congratulations. - Thank you. Oh, perfect. - Look at that. Uh, I gotta catch up. So I'll take a, I'll take a double bourbon neat, please. - Wow. Look at that. - Yeah. - You're not gonna eat anything? - Uh no, I'm probably just gonna get something on the road. I won't stay long. Unfortunately, it's uh, it's it's been one of those days. - Do I even wanna know? - No, but I'm gonna tell ya anyways. - Course you are. - Mm. - Um, unfortunately, all of our exit signs, looks like they were hung backwards. So we're gonna be delayed at least another week, Sam. - Oh, dammit. That's the new contractor? - Yeah, that's the one. - Did you bring the papers? - I knew I forgot something. I'm, sorry pal. Um, when, when are you guys leaving? - Early. Just email them. - Done. - Uh-huh. No more shop talk, guys. This is a celebration, okay? Right, Gia? Come on. - Forgive me. You know what? You guys are right. This is a celebration to you two. - Aw. - Yeah. Happy anniversary. - Thank you. - Cheers. - Thank you. - Look at that. See Isaac, that's all you need. You gotta find yourself a good woman and just settle down. - Right. You know, Beverly, where are my manners? But unfortunately, I only have eyes for one woman. And sadly, she's taken. I love ya, Sam. - Okay. - You've got a beautiful wife. - Okay. Thank you. - Oh, you are smooth, aren't you? - He is very smooth. Listen, seriously. I am making sure that you are not going to be bothered with any business-related fiascos while you're gone. - But, don't forget, it's gonna be a mess when you get back. So, get some rest. Yeah, lots of rest. - Why'd you come? - I was invited. - What if Shane had seen you texting me? - Let him. - We can't do this anymore. I told you this. - You haven't even opened it yet. When are you gonna tell him? - That's not your problem. - You've made it my problem. - Well, he's my husband. - Of course he is. - Then there's nothing else to say. - If you need me. - I don't. - You did. - Hello. - Mr. and Mrs. Gallo? - Yes, that's us. You must be Helen. - I am. Yes, sir. Come right on in. - Hey, go ahead babe. - Oh. - This house has been showcased in all the best Southern Living magazines. My late husband put a lotta pride in this home. He designed it himself. A sort of utopia, he liked to call it. The stubborn thing, he built it by hand. So, it was several years before we could call it a home. - Sounds like a lot of blood, sweat, and tears. - Mostly sweat. There was some blood. The tears were all mine. You'll be staying in the master suite. - Oh great. Go ahead, hun. - Now, I wouldn't be a good host if I didn't tell you about the ghost matter. - Ghost? - Decades before there were any houses built on this lake, the land was owned by a Dr. Arnold and his wife Devorah. They built a huge estate here. And this is where they spent their summers. Elaborate parties, all the rage. And this went sour. She found out that Dr. Arnold and her sister were gettin' all cozy. The poor soul lost her mind. She shot him, strung him up in the attic, and burned the place to the ground. This house was built on that original structure. - Okay. So we're staying on a haunted lake. - Oh, I can assure you that if any of the spirits do come out of hiding, that Dr. Arnold is the perfect Southern gentleman. But Devorah, not so much. But she's a woman scorned, so we don't like to judge. - What happened to her sister? - Good question. I guess you'll have to ask Devorah. Now, if you need anything, and I mean anything, don't hesitate to knock on my door. I'm just downstairs off the living room. - Thank you, Helen. I'm sure everything will be perfect. - Uh, you're staying here too? - Oh yes. I have my own suite with a kitchen and a bathroom. So, you won't hear me. I'll be like a nun in compline. - Well um, like I said, thank you, Helen. I'm sure everything will be just perfect. Right, babe? - Well if this storm holds off, I'll believe it. - Is there a storm coming? - I just say what I hear. - Who knows? Maybe we'll get lucky. - I like the way you think. - Hey, thanks Helen, again. Babe, that was crazy, huh? - Did you know she was gonna be here too? - Ah, no, I must've missed that. Oh, she's not gonna get in the way. Plus, when she hears how loud you get. When I... - Oh, stop. - Baby. - That's not me. Oh. - Oh, there's only you. - Mm. You must be talking about somebody else. - No. There's only you. I missed you. - You see me all the time. - Yeah, but. - Okay. - Oh. - Okay. - Yeah. Okay. - Yeah. Okay. Go get our things. - I'll go get our things. Yeah, maybe I should get my jacket. - Mm-hmm. - Bye. - I'll see you in a minute. - Hey. You know, it's too early for regrets. - What do you think people think when they see us together? - I think people see two people, me and you, very much obsessed. - But your family, your friends, they don't know me. - I know you. Hey. We're gonna have a wonderful life together. Hmm? - Mm. - I won't let you down. Nothing, and I won't let anything get . Ever. Hey you. Mm. - Hey. - What're you thinking about? - Hmm. Why do you think Devorah killed herself? I mean, she already got her revenge. She could've just thrown his body in this lake and gone on with her life, and found someone to appreciate her. - Is that what you'd do? - I don't know. Mm. Why didn't we get married in the summer? - Because you insisted we shouldn't wait. Hey babe, did I ever tell you the story of that time our, our golden retriever ran away? - That dog was close to death. You didn't realize it, but that poor dog-- - Okay. Okay, okay, okay. I would just like to know how long you two have been together. - Hey, did you hear that babe? Mom wants to know how long the two of us have been together. - Oh, uh. - Seems like, like forever. - Yeah. - Right? It's been like a month or so, Mom, give or take. Right? - Yeah. - And you just up and decided to marry, without telling us? - It just kinda happened, Mom. - And I can't believe that your mother's okay with this. - Uh, she just wants me to be happy. - Yeah, she's happy, Mom. Everybody's happy. Why can't you just be happy, right guys? Come on. - Yeah, right. - Well, I don't know what you've done to my son, but he's happy. Oh god, I'm gonna need another drink. - Let's move. - What? - Yeah. Yeah, let's just, yeah, let's just quit everything and, and leave it all behind. Just get a little, little cabin in the middle of nowhere. No distractions, just me and you. And I'll, I'll, I'll work the land, or I don't know, be a fishermen. - Have you ever gone fishing, ever, in your life? - Uh, yes. - Yeah? - I have, actually. - Hmm. - Once. - I didn't know that. - When I was a kid, I caught a fish, like a-- - Awesome. - Big fish. I threw it back in the water, 'cause it looked like it was in pain, but I caught one. - You're so sweet. - Well, it's true. You could make soap. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Soap? - Oh, we still have to be clean, and we won't need any clothes, 'cause it'll just be you and I. - Oh course. - We won't need clothes. - You're not serious? You can never leave any of this behind. And then the chorus, you know. I wrote it for you. - Well here, some wine. Celebrate. - Oh well, thank you. - Moving into our new home. - Yes. Geez. Can't believe all these boxes are just mine, huh? - I told you, I didn't have anything worth bringing. - I know, but not even some like uh, old china from your grandmother, or, or love letters from your first boyfriend? - No. - No? - Nothing like that. No, it's a, it's a fresh start. You know, why bring any baggage when you clearly have enough of your own? - Mm. You know maybe uh, once we get settled, you know, my, my parents can come down, visit. Be nice, right? - Uh-huh. - Be nice if your mom came too. - Mm. She's just not around much. - I know but, it still wouldn't hurt to ask. Right? You're my family now, Shane. - Mm, I like the way that sounds. You know, I just, I would just love to know where you, where you come from, you know? - So um, have you ever written any other love songs for any other girls before? - No. Why do ask? - Just a question. - You're the only one. - I'm sorry. - You know, there's more to that story-- Single picture will tell ya. Here. - Oh my god. - What? - Oh my god. What is wrong with you? - I don't, I don't know who that is. - That's all right. - Honey, honey, are you okay? Uh, uh, what're you doing here? - What? I'm sorry. I didn't know you had guests. - Oh, oh, well if you'd call me every once in a while. - Is everything okay? - She broke in my house and broke a mug. - Helen, what the hell's going on here? - Forgive my son for the intrusion. He may look like a brute, but he's as dense as they come. - Gia, honey, you're bleeding. - I'm sorry. - Uh, name's Jedi. - Jedediah. - Jedi. - Can I get a paper towel, please? Here, stand up. Okay, watch it. Okay, your feet. Okay. Oh, babe. We'll give it some water. - Not that bad. - Here. Let me, let me get uh, let me go get a towel. All right? Are your feet okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. - Okay. I mean, you know, I guess it's not her fault, you know. And him, I, I don't know. That, he's a, he's a weird guy, isn't he? And what was he even talking about? But, I guess he's harmless, you know? And, and look. We still have this room , and this uh, really comfy big bed. Hm? Hm? And I still, oh, I still have this mm, this, this beautiful, gorgeous-- - Shane. - Woman sitting right here in front of me, and it's, oh-- - Not now. - What? - Not now. Not now. - Not now? - No. - Okay. Okay. Mm. Just uh, trying to find something positive. - Well, not everything works out the way we expect it to all the time, you know? - What does that mean? - Well, you know, I mean, things don't magically get better just because you're so good at pretending everything's okay. - Well , be nice to at least get a little credit for trying. I wish you'd just talk to me, you know? Tell me what's on your mind. - Um. Do you ever think of her? - Who? - I mean , did she do things that I wouldn't do? Is, is that, is that why you , why you did it in the first place? - This is what's going? Have you been waiting for the worst possible moment to bring this up, huh? - You just asked me what I was thinking. And then you belittle me for it. - Who's belittling you? - Why can't you just answer the question, Shane? - Nothing happened. Okay? - You know, there's, there's consequences for your actions. And when you're with someone else-- - Yeah, and I told you a hundred times, nothing happened. - Why can't you just tell me the truth so we can move on? - You know, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna admit to something, Gia, that's all in your head. - All in my head? It's all in my head, and I'm crazy? I'm making all of this up? Were there others, Shane? - This is unbelievable. I, I don't believe this. - Were there others, Shane? - Oh. - Shane. - Take you on a journey to the small but charming town of York, South Carolina, where the souls of the dead still seek their rest. Join us, as we wander through the haunted hallways and eerie streets on another episode of. And then that's when boom, cue carnival-type music. We got the strobe light effect coming on, the title blow on the screen. It's gonna be the whole thing. Mom, get that, make that mirror disappear. So what do guys think? - Wow. - Huh? Eh, huh? - Okay. - You asked what I did. - Which, which, so, so you're like a-- - Paranormal investigator. I have a show. - On TV? - Well, it's on the web, but the fan base is growing. - You know, Gia's an actress. - Ah. - You're an actress? - It's really, it's just a hobby. - Oh, come on, honey. Go ahead and tell 'em what you've been in. - No. Stop it. - But I'm no actor. It's just me. - So you just, you know, chase ghosts? - I prefer the term, contacting the dead. I'm serious, if I got a drink for every skeptic I met. - Listen, I, you know I just like to believe in what's in front of me. - Just because you can't see something in front of you doesn't mean it's not there. - Come on. I mean, there's no audience now, right? It's just us. You, you can honestly look me in the eye and tell me that you've caught something supernatural? - Hey Shane, guess what? I've caught something supernatural. - Have you ever seen anything here? - Are you kidding me? Growing up by the lake? The water's like a catalyst for the paranormal. I, I, you never know what's gonna show up. - So why do you do it if you're gonna get hurt? - The possibility of the unknown. You know, there's an energy all around us, even though we can't see it. You know, lessons we could learn from people who've lived and died way before us, an insight on places way beyond this realm. - I don't know. I think you need to leave the past in the past. You know, just don't mess with that stuff. - Perhaps, maybe. Maybe, perhaps, anyway. For me though, it's the closest I can get to feeling something bigger than my own existence. - What are you doing? - Reducing my life span by 11 minutes. Maybe yours by six. - You can't smoke in this house. - What the hell? - I didn't need you to come here. - Right. - How do you think this is helping? - Oh, Gia and Shane lived happily ever after. The end. - I'm not gonna play your sick little games. - Hm, what's the matter, baby girl? Did he hurt you? Oh, there it is. That ocean of insecurity you wear behind your eyes. Ready to drown you every time someone speaks the truth. - I need you to leave. - Mm. - I need you just to go. - Hell no, we aren't finished. I warned you about letting them in. - Hey. Sh, sh, sh. It's just me, it's just me. - Geez. All right, man. What the hell? Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm good. Uh, you know. Hey, you didn't tell me this place was all the way out in the country. I mean, god, I have some papers that Sam needs you to sign. And uh, you know, I, I, I hit some black ice, car slid right into a tree. - Jesus. - I, I, I tried to send 'em to you via email, but I couldn't get a signal. I mean, wifi was spotty. Must've been the storm. - Yeah. And this client, man, every step of the way. Uh, where's the car now? - I mean, god only knows, bud. I had to walk the rest of the way. I don't know, half a mile. - Jesus. - We're just glad you're okay. - Yeah, 'member you wanted me to go back out in that earlier. - Looks like we're gonna have a full house tonight. - No, no, no, please. I, I, I couldn't impose any, I insist. - Uh, well, I'm sure Mr. and Mrs. Gallo won't mind. - Yes, we insist. - I mean-- - We're not gonna let you get back out in that. You're here now. - And, even if not, I mean, you're way out in the country, as you say, and I'm sure Jedediah has some clothes that you could wear. Nobody's goin' anywhere tonight. - Welcome. - He's a, he's a little weird. - Yeah, you said it. - You look great, Gia. - Thank you. - Doesn't she? - Shane. We shouldn't have come here. - Can you just take a breath? - We need to leave. Are you listening to me, Shane? - Yes, yes, I heard you. - I just, I just wanna leave. I just wanna go home. - Gia. Why don't you just talk to me, huh? Tell me what's on your mind. I'm sorry. I am. Do you remember when I first gave you this? - Yes. - Do you know that I never ever regret it? - No? Not once? - No. - Well, I would think after 13 years of marriage, that you'd find some way to be honest with me. - Pre-wedding jitters? - Is what it's called? - Well, it's natural to feel nervous or unsure of yourself when you're about to make a major life decision. - I just don't wanna disappoint him. - What makes you think you'll disappoint him? - I'm afraid I won't be who I need to be. - Who do you need to be? - The person he fell in love with? - Describe her to me. - I mean, just Gia. She's happy, optimistic. Just the right amount of confidence, but not too self-assured. She has enough vulnerability to let him know that she still needs him. - You refer to Gia in a third person. It almost sounds like you see her as completely different from yourself. - Why would I do that? - Because you're afraid to let Shane see who you really are. - Is this version of yourself that you present to your patients, the real you, Dr. Marcum? Or do you change to make us feel safe? Do you ever drop your guard or let your flaws show? Exactly. Because if you did, if you would show us that you're human, maybe even a little bit crazy, then you'd just be like the rest of us, and we wouldn't trust you. - Do you think that this version will sustain itself when times get tough? - Love changes a person. You can't love someone as much as we love each other and not have it transform you. - Okay. - Maybe you've never been in love. Maybe that's why you can't understand power that it gives a person. - Or the power that it takes away? Time's up. - Can I come in? - Of course. You don't have to ask. - So, did you really come to bring Shane papers? Isaac, I'm, I'm really trying to be nice and I appreciate everything that you've done, but-- - Do you? - Of course I do. But none of that matters now. It can't. - Hm. Did you bring it with you? I'm trying to help you here. Why can't you see that? - I see what I'm meant to see. - Hm. We both know he's no good for you. But, maybe that's how you like it. - Who the hell are you to tell me? - I'm the one to tell you that everything that you need to see is right in front of you. You know, you say it doesn't matter, but you brought the envelope with you anyways. - If I open the envelope, and no matter what's inside, you have to leave me alone. What do you hope to get from all of this? - Gia, what I hope to get and what I expect are two very different things. - I can't. I can't. - Yeah, okay. How long have I known you, Gia? - You were Shane's friend first, Isaac. - Yeah. Just because you seem to have forgotten what he put you through, doesn't mean that I can. It doesn't mean that I will. - I have to go. - Shane need Jane. Baby. Mm. - Oh. Shane. - Oh yeah, I think you missed a little spot right there, and-- - Okay. Okay, okay. You gotta stop. Shane, stop. Remember, they told us we need to wait a week. If this is gonna work, we have to wait. Okay? We agreed to this. - No, no, no, no. You agreed, honey, just-- - No. - Why? I just don't know how much more of this I can take. - Why are you getting so worked up about it? We agreed to this. If we want the treatments to work-- - I, I don't need some doctor telling me how, where, and when I can make love to my wife. - Of course, because it's all about you, Shane. - Look. It doesn't have to be this way. - What do you mean? - We can explore other options. You need to see this. Sit here. Look, that could be our child. Right there, honey. - No. - Look at-- - No. Shane, we talked about this. - Well, I'm sorry but that ship sailed the moment we heard the word infertile. - Oh. Oh. - That wasn't cool. - No. No, it wasn't cool. It wasn't cool. Just, just one more time. - You think that-- - I know it's gonna work. Just, just one more-- - Oh, that's what we said last time and the time before that and the time before that. - You just wanna hurt me. - No, I don't wanna hurt you, honey. That's the whole point. I just don't wanna sit here and watch you hurt yourself anymore. You have to face reality. There's, there's no shame in that, honey. - How would you know? How would you know? You're never here. How would you know there's no shame in that? You don't know what I feel. You don't know what I want. - It's just not worth it. - It's not worth it? It's worth it to me. Doesn't that matter? You know, I'm really sorry, Shane, that I'm not the woman you thought I was. I can find someone else who'll do this for me if you're not willing to do this. - Wow. - Shane. - No. - Where are you going, Shane? - I don't know. - Where are you going? Helen, I'm, I'm sorry. I, I didn't see you here. Are you okay? - Who's hurt you, honey? - What? What're you doing? Helen? - Is it your husband? - I don't, I don't know what you're talking about. - I see a darkness, a, I don't know if it's yours or, somebody else's. - Where you gonna go? - Away from you. - So it's my fault that you hurt her? - You're delusional. - Daddy. - Oh, good. Look, see what you did? The kid heard you. - Move, before I move you. - Please don't leave me here. - It's all right, little one. I'd take you with me if I could. You take care of you. - I'm gonna tell everyone. Everyone's gonna know what you did to her. Do you hear me? I'm gonna tell everybody what you did. - You need help. If not for yourself, for her. - Don't you talk about my kid. What do you know about her? You see what you've done? I didn't do it. You did it. Think you're hot stuff? What are you looking at? You did this. You ruined everything. - Please give me my giraffe back, Mommy. I need her. Give her back, please. - You ruined everything. You've ruined my life. - Eventually, everything ends. - Now out. There you go. Yes. Now, you said, "I need her." And you said, "Eventually everything ends." - I don't know. - It's, that's okay. We've done enough for today. - Is there something wrong with me? - I think that we made tons of progress, and we're going to have you feeling back to yourself in no time. - I don't know who that is. - How long have you been up here? Who did this to you? What did he do to you? - He didn't do this to me. - No! No, no. - Gia honey, it's me. Huh? - She just started shaking. Then she went down. - You okay? Come on, let's-- - What happened? - Let's get you back to bed. Come on. Do you want, you wanna talk about it? - I don't wanna shut my eyes. - You don't have to. - We haven't seen a storm this bad since hurricane Amy. The city has decided to call in the National Guard. As crews work round the clock repairing bridges, ice and damaged trees have caused power outages throughout the area and surrounding counties. - It's the end of the world. - We're all gonna die. - I feel like I'm losing my mind. I need you to tell me. - Yeah. - What's in the envelope? If you know he's cheating, just say something. - Gia, I'm starting to think that it wouldn't even matter anymore. - Of course it would. - What are you afraid of? Look, I try, I try to be supportive but it just starts to feel like a waste of my time. - I'm not those other women. - You haven't even opened the envelope yet, so I'm starting to believe like maybe you are. - It's gone too far. - What scares you the most, huh? The fact that you lost control or maybe, maybe you just believe, maybe it's because you've just become an empty vessel for everyone just to fill you up with whatever they want. - Is that what you think I am, an empty vessel? - Gia, do you honestly even care what I think of you? - Why do I feel like the bad guy here? Oh, it smells great in here. - Mrs. Gallo. Um, I hope you're hungry. - Well, you outdid yourself. Do you need any help at all? - No. No, I'm fine. Sit down. - Yeah um, I wanted to ask you something. - Yes? - You, you said something last night. Do you remember? - I don't know. What did I say? - Um, no, nevermind. Uh, are you sure you don't need help? If you just tell me where the dishes are, I'd be happy to set the table for you, or. Yeah. - Marriage is like a fabrication. You know, like a false sense of security. Like, you know, you, you vow to be with somebody the rest of your life. And it's like, boom, off the market, problem solved. Okay? But then, you know, what happens when someone wants to be with somebody else? You know, is, is marriage gonna stop that? - Uh, it's called commitment. - Commitment can only blanket natural tendencies for so long. Entering a contract with another human being, you know, basically, "Now we belong to each other forever." Like, you know, basically, no matter what happens. Yeah, no thanks. Yeah, I don't think that's exactly what it means. - I used to date this girl, Tatiana. She was a taphophiliac, hardcore into hanging out at cemeteries. Anyway, she uh, she wanted me to commit to her, and I almost did. But then I realized that she had been lying to me the whole time. She wasn't into hanging out at graves. She was dead. She had no other choice. But as humans we're constantly evolving. Like the person you vow to be with now, may not be the person you eventually get. - Wow. Does your mother know you're this cynical? - Sounds like you've been hurt. - I swear, this one's psychic. But hey, like, you guys, what has it been 13 years? I mean, you gotta be doing something right. - Honey? Gia, I'm home. Babe? You up here? What're you doing? Gi, you up here? Gigi, you up here, baby? Hey. Hi sexy. I missed you. What're you doin'? - Hi. I missed you. Why haven't you called me? I, I wish your body was next to mine right now. - You went through my email? - You're so special to me. - You went through my emails? This is work. - This is work? - Yes. It's just work. We worked on a project together, babe. She worked with us. We, we had a few, a few late nights meals over, yeah-- - I thought I was-- - With drinks, but that-- - The actor, Shane. - You know what? You're not even in the right head space for this, babe. This is not normal. Nothing happening. You have to believe me, okay? She's a friend. - She's a friend? - Yes. - All right, you work with her, or is she a friend, Shane? Make your mind up. No wonder I can't get pregnant. - Oh, semantics, Gia, please, just stop. Just stop. - Have you stopped? Have you? - Have I stopped what, honey? I haven't done anything. All right? You have to believe me. Okay? Listen. Listen to me. Listen to me. Look, nothing happened. Huh? Nothing happened. I want you. Hey, I only ever wanted you. - You disgust me, Shane. - Disgust you? - Yes. - Disgust you? Disgust you? You say to me after all I've done, huh? Dammit. Just listen to me. - You're hurting me, Shane, you're hurting me. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - For what part? - I'm sorry. - What part didn't you mean, Shane? - Ah, I'm sorry, baby. Honey, put your hand on me, please. Tell me you love me. Honey. Please, I'm sorry, baby. Tell me you love me. - Shane? - Yes. - I have to tell you something. - Gia. - I've had bad things happen to me. No, oh no. No. What if, what if I did bad things to you? - Honey. All that matters is that I love you and you love me, right? That's all that matters. - That's not enough. - Yes, yes, yes. Hey, I knocked. - Hey. - Look, Gia, um, I'm, I'm, I'm disappointed that this anniversary weekend hasn't worked out like we'd hoped. - I don't blame you. - I'm willing to do whatever it takes. - I don't know, Shane, there just so much stuff. I don't know how we're gonna get past it. - Yep. Yeah, it's me. That's funny. I didn't think I needed your permission to come out here. And clearly, I wasn't gonna ask for it. No, she hasn't seen anything. Why? You know, did it maybe occur to you, Adrian, that you just might be wrong about this one? All right. Mm-hmm. Later. April, Caitlyn, Devin. Christina, Christina also, and Tara, Vanessa, whatever. - Doesn't that feel a little different? It's party time. Can we do a dip? - Can I borrow your princess? - It's coming, baby. - Think I'm gonna grab another drink. Anything for you? You don't wanna dance? Did I do that right? Something like that? May I have this dance? - What happened to it? - Look what happened here. - Very good. - Lose something? So, how long do you think you can keep this up? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Look at yourself. You can't even keep your head straight anymore. I guess being good Gia isn't so perfect after all. Yep. Walk away. It's always been your thing. - What do you want from me? - Hey. Who are you talking to? Come on. - Hey. - Hey. We need to talk. Okay? - Okay. - You haven't been taking these, huh? - You're going through my things, Shane? - How long? - You don't under-- - Does your doctor know? - I had to. - Had to? Gia you told me your moods are all over the place, off the-- - My moods? - Yeah. I only know what you tell me. - My moods were fine, Shane, before. - Yeah. That's probably what it is then. You know, you're withdrawing. - Probably what? - Probably why you haven't been-- - What, myself? Uh, or less difficult? Forgiving? Understanding? - Yeah, I was gonna say yourself. You nailed it. - Yeah. - Yeah. This could be serious. - This is serious. - Yeah it is. - It's been serious. - This whole weekend, I've been doing nothing but trying, this whole messed-up weekend. Nothing, but trying. - You've been trying? - You're gonna take this. - No. Are you happy now, Shane? You wanna check? Look. Are you happy? - Hey, don't, don't leave. Please, don't leave. - Where am I gonna go, Shane? Do you mind? - Do you know why Devorah killed her husband? - You said it was because she found out he was having an affair. - Her and Arnold tried for years to conceive a child. But it wasn't God's will. When she found out that her sister was carrying her husband's seed, she felt like it was the ultimate betrayal from God. - I thought um, I thought she didn't hurt the sister. Right? - Well she didn't wanna let the child suffer. - Oh. - But she did. She did. - What happened to the sister? - Well she had the baby. She raised her without a man. But she never quite got over the fact that she betrayed her sister. That she betrayed herself. Do you even know what it's like to be conceived by the flesh? - You're her. Right? - Yes. - You, you're the daughter? - Yes. I'm returning to the place where it all began. That is my penance, and my absolution. - Shane? - Someone must have left the door unlocked. Oh. Now that is so not like you. Something I would do, but not Gia. - My husband's right outside. - Let me talk to him. - Why are you doing this? - You're kidding. Look, when I was around, nobody got into your head. - I wanted a family. - Yeah. Yep, we were a family, okay? We, we took care of one another. - Well, the scars tell a different story. - Yeah, I showed you another way. Okay? - Doesn't matter. I mean, this isn't real. - No? You think you can run? Huh? Just wake up and what, just change who you are? Didn't you learn anything from your mother? You know, I watched you let them in. Mm-hmm. Let them hurt you over and over and over again. Like you just had no control over anything. - No one, no one believed me. - I believed you. - Tell me what to do. - Okay. You were wrong. Nothing ever ends. Sure, sure, the memories can fade, but you know what? The imprint is still there. This little fairy tale you've created, yeah, it's never going to be yours. - Maybe it can be. - Just, go back. - What if I can't go back? - Hey, may as well take 'em now. - What a circus. - Huh, yeah. One hell of a night, huh? - Remind me just to buy jewelry next year, huh? - Yeah so, how is Gia? - Question of the night. - Yeah. Some guys just don't know how lucky they really are. - Luck, has nothing to do with it. Do you know, man, I spent my whole life trying to make this, trying to make this girl happy. - Yeah. - You know? What did it get me? All she wants to see is the bad. You know? What's up with that? - I wouldn't know. I'm one of the good guys. - One of the good guys. Jesus. Hit me. - Let's fill up. Coming in. - Mrs. Gallo, you still there? - Yes, I'm still here. Yeah uh, I'm sorry, but Shane's not in the office. Did you try and call him? - Yes, I tried calling him. He said he was in a meeting. - Okay. Do you want me to check? - Yes. - Yeah, I'm not seeing a meeting. Uh, maybe, maybe he went out to dinner, maybe-- - You think he deserves to know? - You miscarried. Don't you think that that's something he should know? - It wasn't even a baby. - An embryonic pregnancy, I know, which sometimes happens during IVF. But it's not something that you should have to deal with on your own. - Well, he should've thought of that before he lied to me. - I know how important it was for you to have a baby. And I'm concerned that if you don't address this-- - I just don't wanna bring a baby into this world anymore. Um, we weren't actively trying. And I thought you said without the injections that-- - Yeah um, and you know, and it's, it's kind of a miracle because this, I can tell you that I've never done a phone call like this before. Working here all these years, I mean, you're actually gonna have a baby. Um , you okay? Like, this is a good thing, right? - Oh, no, this is a great thing. This is a great thing, um. No, thank you, I'm sorry, I know this is weird. I'm sorry, I just didn't expect that, and it's very exciting and, you just gave me the best news of my life, thank you. Thank you. Bye. Hey. - Hey. Wow. Look at you. This is a pleasant surprise. How are you? - I'm good. I'm good. - Um, Shane's at the uh, at the other site. - Yeah, no, I, I know. Um, it happened. - It? What happened? - It happened. - Oh, it happened. Congratulations. - Yeah. - What about Shane? - I'm telling him tonight. - Good. Uh, can I get you a drink of water? Please have a seat. - Um, okay. - Wasn't going to give this to you. But I suppose considering the news, now is about uh, as good a time as any. Here. - I thought you said you didn't find anything. - Gia, open it. Open it. - I can't. I can't. - Dammit. Really? Really? - Whatever's in there, it doesn't matter anymore. I mean, that's the past, right? - Well, I think you might wanna reconsider that. - Are you jealous, Isaac? I mean, I know we got close. - Yes, uh, close. That's what you call it? Close? - Yeah. - That's all we were was just close? - That's it. - I see. - Is it bad? Is it, is it really bad? - I suppose that depends on what you're hoping to find. Look um, it was great to see you. But, if you don't mind, I have some places I need to go to. - Sure. - Hey. - Hey. - You're home late. - I had an audition. - Ah. How'd it go? - I, I don't know yet. - So, I think that I have the perfect thing to take your mind off of it. What would you think of a weekend away? - For what? - Um, our anniversary? You know? I mean with everything that's been going on, I just think, you know, we, we deserve it. You deserve it. "Shane, did I tell you that you're just like, the best husband ever? You're almost like magical?" - No, it, that's great. That's, that sounds, that sounds great. - Well good, because I, I booked it, and I can't wait. - Yeah, so um, is there anything else you wanna tell me? - Like what? - Your fault, you did this, you ran him off just like the others. - You need help. If not for yourself, for her. - You ruined my life. I hate you. You ruin everything. - Does your doctor know? Gia, you told me your moods are all over the place. - Everyone's gonna know what you did to her. Do you hear me? I'm gonna tell everybody what you did. - Dr. Marcum? - Well, good news. The road should be clearing by morning. - When did you first realize? - Realize what? - That I wasn't who you thought I'd be. - I'm not sure I understand. - You do, Shane. - Gia. Gia, hasn't this weekend been hard enough? Look. Everything was fine. And the company had me travel and you didn't take it well. I thought maybe at first you were just acting out. You know, as a way to keep me around. But I had no choice. I had to go. So, I left. Every time I came back, I don't know. There was, there was something different. I thought maybe at first you were just mad. You know, and you'd snap out of it and adjust. You said you'd been seeing a doctor, doing work. Then we thought, then we thought having a child , someone to keep you company. I tried. We tried. But it just, just distanced us further. Whatever light you had on when we were first together, it just started to go out. I didn't wanna see it. I didn't wanna think that I was the cause. Gia, every, every marriage has their share of problems, you know, so I thought ours would just-- - Work itself out? - One night I came home and, you just were, you were acting different. I thought you were preparing for some role. It didn't stop. You were into it. - I'm so sorry. - No. - I was so difficult to live with. And because of that you don't think I'm worth telling the truth to, Shane. - Of course you are. I should have addressed it. - How can you look at me in my eyes and tell me that you, you saw me day after day just destroying myself, just falling apart, and you did nothing. - That's not-- - You took advantage of it. And I know, Shane, I know, in my heart I've known that there was another woman, and you, you can't even tell the truth to that. And it hurts. It hurts me. - Well. - Who are you? - You know who I am. Do not leave me here. - Let go of me. Let go of me, I don't know who you are. - Gotta admit, Jedi, your mom makes a mean cup of coffee. - Ah, thanks man. Mean, I've had it forever. - Well, it's, it's special. - Yeah. How's your head? - Uh, well, thanks, I'll survive. - Can I get ya some more coffee? Any cream? - Uh, no Helen, thank you. - I'm fine. - Good morning. - Hey, what's up? - Mr. Gallo, come and have a bite before you hit the road. - Uh, is Gia here? - No, I haven't seen her yet. - She took off. - Where'd she take off to? - Well, I like to wake up early to meditate down by the lake-- - Wait, she what? - And, yeah, and I saw her down there, and she was trying to start the car. I think the battery's dead from the cold. - Jesus. - I helped her start it, and then I told her to check out my web show. She said she would when she got back. - Wait, wait, so you're saying my wife left with our car? - Yeah, that's about it. - What, what car'd she take? - Um, the one that worked. - Is there, is there somewhere I can get reception in this house? Gia. Hey, it's me, hon. Listen, I, I, I just wanna make sure you're okay. Can you just please give me a call back? All right? Gia? - No, it's Beverly. Sam said you called. - Yeah. Have you heard from Gia? - No. Why, what's going on? Last we thought, you guys were enjoying yourselves. - Oh god, it's, it's been a nightmare. She left this morning, and uh, no one's heard from her. And, Isaac's here, he's helping out. - Isaac? What's he doing out there? - Um, well, he delivered those papers that Sam needed me to sign. - Papers, uh, no sir. Not from Sam, no. I put the fear of God in him about bothering you guys while you were away, and... - Anything? - No, nothing. - Um, all right. I'm gonna go grab my car and drive around, see if I can find her. - Thought you said you crashed your car? - Yeah. - Hey, Isaac. What're you here for? - I told you that. - No, what are you, what are you really here for, man? - Protecting her. - Protect who? From what? - Look Shane, I could've made this all go away. Her worries, her questions, everything. All I had to do is show her that she was right about you. - So you're saying you have evidence to tear us apart. That's what you want, right? - Yeah. - So why didn't you do it then? - 'Cause you and I both know that if she knew the truth, she probably wouldn't survive it. - I think you underestimate Gia. - Oh yeah? So I assume that you admitted that you someone the night that she was home all by herself, bleeding out in the bathroom-- - You better stop right there. - Or what? What's gonna happen? Huh? I know you're worried. I'd be worried out of my mind too, especially with a new baby and all. Oh. - What? What baby? - I let out the surprise. - Gia's pregnant? - I thought she would've told you. - How do you know that? - It's mine, man. - You and her? - She just wanted to be loved. Get off me! Get off me! Huh? You don't deserve her! Be a man. - You came back. - But I don't wanna be here. - Neither did I. - What was I suppose to do? I didn't know. - Maybe you wanted me to hurt. - No, I wanted love. - Did you find it? Love? Look at me. Look at what she's made you do to me. - You've ruined my life. I hate you. You ruin everything. I hate you. I wish you were never born. I hate you. You ruined my life. - Stop. Stop, stop. - I wish you were never born. - You know you believed her. - I hate you. I wish you were never born. - You didn't even give me a chance. Do you know who I am? - Yeah. You tell me. - Dr. Marcum, Dr. Marcum, is Gia inside? - Yes. And you'll leave her be. - Like hell I will. - Isaac. Don't you forget how well I know you too. You think she's weak. That she'll need you. - She came to me. - There's something different about this one. - How so? - Unlike any one of us, we become who we need to be, depending on the situation. But now Gia can't see herself as she truly is. - But I, I know her. I know Gia, she's, she's not crazy. - I didn't say she's crazy. I just hope that she'll be able to accept everything that's happened to her. All that she is, that she'll become who she is at her core. - And who might that be, Dr. Marcum? - That's what you're gonna help me figure out. That is, if you still want to. - How do I know she's gonna be safe? - Oh, we should have dealt with these codependency issues when you were my patient. - Excuse me? - Oh, that should be Shane. - Wait, wait, you told him that she's here too? - Don't look so shocked. He is her emergency contact. - You really enjoy this, don't you? Manipulating people, using their secrets to fulfill some need in your own pathetic little life. - Oh, just as you do, honey. - Where is she? - Hey. - Gia, honey, what are you doing? Just drop it. Everything's gonna be okay. - Do something. Do something, will you? - Gia, what do you want? - You have no idea the hell she put me through. - Amber. - I know about the baby. It's okay. I'm not mad. - I'm scared. - It's what you wanted. - You've heard your turn. - Gia, I've been with you all along. Please, I can take you away. - But I'm good at being Gia. - None of this was supposed to be yours. - What is it you told me? Eventually everything ends. You, you're, you're in control now. What do you want? You said it again. "I need her." - Yes. - Who is her? - My friend. - What does she do when she comes? - She helps me. - How? - She protects me. - Does she have a name? So who are these other women? - Parts of me, of who I was. But they're outside of me. I can talk to them and touch them. Yet, they're inside of me too. - And when you're on the medication? - It's like they're sleeping. - So do you think it would be helpful to let your husband know about this? - No. He needs Gia. We both do. You like me like this. Don't you? - Yeah, I do. - Do you think that this ideal version will sustain itself when times get tough? - You did what you had to do. Please, please, let me have a chance. - She's gone and left me an orphan. - You're still holding back. That's the thing about this business, you can be whatever you wanna be. I don't know. With you, I, I'm still seeing Gia. - I, I don't know what to tell you. I'm doing what I learned in class. - Just stop. Just lose control for one moment? Stop putting things on. And start being. Let's try something different. - Do you know why you're sitting in a chair? It's because you're weak. It's because you have no confidence. It's because you have no strength. It's because I'm better than you. It's because you have so much fear. It's because you have so much to be afraid of. - Freeze. Gia, ask yourself, is this the character you wanna be? We can end the scene right now, and this is the narrative you chose to leave us with. Or you can choose to change that narrative. This is your scene, not Joe's. So it's in your hands. - Eventually, everything ends. It's not your fault. Everything is just beginning.
