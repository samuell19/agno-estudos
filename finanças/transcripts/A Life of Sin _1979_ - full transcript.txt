The cemetery's practically deserted now. We've been waiting for quite a while. Waiting for Isabel la Negra's last relatives and her friends. The lady in the center with the bandage on her arm was the last person to see Isabel la Negra alive. She was wounded. The lady on the right is Rita, a cousin. The gentleman on the left is Manolin, her adopted son. Excuse me, Sonya, forgive me for speaking to you at this moment. But can you describe exactly what happened? There has been some confusion. The last report, the police... No. Please, I can t. Please, not now. Manolin...Please, excuse us. [MUMBLING] I'm sorry. Forgive us. Thank you. This is Miguel Cintron, public cemetery in Ponce. El pueblo opina. Isabel la Negra. Isa, for those of you who might have known her better. Our city has respect for Isabel. Her legendary generosity was not only enjoyed by the poor people of the city, but also by our local institutions who were recipients of the same generosity. I have to admit, however, public opinion is divided on the matter. Mmm-hmm. And that is why we are calling this program "Isabel la Negra "Angel or the Devil's Sinner?" You are a very important woman. Very, very important, my daughter. [INHALING DEEPLY] You are gonna be places. You have a big destiny. Will I find happiness? I want to be loved by my man and be happy with him. [EXCLAIMING] No, no! Get out of here! There s no place here for evil spirits! No! Go away! It's your destiny. Ooh! I can see things. Ooh... [EXCLAIMING] There will be a change. I see a fight! Take the best part of that. I see money. Lots of money. Big money. I don't want any money, I want him. What about him? Will he be mine? Please look and see if he will be mine alone. Isa! Bless all the house with mint weeds. Spread them all over the house. Isa! Protect yourself! Protect yourself! Love and money. Love. Protect this house. Only love and good spirits. [EXCLAIMING] [BELL TOLLING] The spirit of love. The spirit of love and harmony. May there be love. May there be love and the good influence of love. Protect this home. Protect all that dwell in it. Love and harmony. [SHOOING] Love. The light of love. Love and harmony. Love for all. [ROOSTER CROWING] Bread! Fresh bread! Bread! Isa.HAWKER: Fresh bread! Isa. ISABEL: Oh, there's Paulo. Give him some coffee later. What happened to you? HAWKER: Bread. She'll tell you what to do. HAWKER: Bread! Where are you going? Bread! Fresh bread! Leave her two loaves. Monsignor Gomez has determined that Isabel la Negra was indeed a sinner. And therefore not worthy of our forgiveness. The Catholic Church has denied funeral services to Isabel. Why deny Isabel a service in church? When she, just like all of us, like the Monsignor himself, was a child of God? Call the station. Oh, by the way, ladies and gentlemen, before I start taking your phone calls, I want to announce that tomorrow night we will have in-studio guests. Davila? It's me. Cut the audio. Get that bastard off the air and throw in a commercial. We did not act arbitrarily. The Holy Mother Church governs itself morally by its own laws, but there are some who seem to ignore this. In the few days since Isabel's unfortunate demise, the church has been the object of the vilest attacks, provoked by the sad commentaries of a misinformed journalist. Today his television program is one of the most watched, if not the one with the largest audience. Unfortunately, sensationalism sells products. Some people do not mind glorifying a person who has lived all of her life in a state of mortal sin if it means that they will derive economic benefits. We ask those persons who are saying that they mourn Isabel's tragic death, we ask those persons who are pretending to forget her immoral and sordid way of life, we ask them to pray that she may rest in peace and that God will forgive her, and have mercy on her soul. Nice? That'll be all, right? Oh, wait, I forgot the garlic. Shall I charge this to Don Armandito? No. WOMAN: Isa! Isa! Hey! Isa! Isa! How you been? One hardly sees you these days. Isa, you don't remember me? I am your aunt! The sister of your mother. Oh, you look good, Isa, as usual, very good. When are you coming home? Everybody ask about you, Isa. You have not forgotten the way, have you? Isa, did you get married? Your mother must be turning in the grave, her daughter shacked up with a whitey. Black is black and white is white. [SCOFFS] With all that food I could have fed the family for a whole month! Charcoal! Charcoal! Coal! Charcoal! Coal! Charcoal! [SINGING IN SPANISH] Get it, it's right next to you! Are you kidding? Those things bite. Put it on the stove. I worked very hard to get the party registered. Crabs don't do any harm! What is... [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Hey, what's going on? TONY: Look, it's in the corner. Ah, Isa, I cannot wait. For independence, I am with Luis, but Armandito, he doesn't believe in anything. All he wants is to become an assembly man. Come on, Margo. Hey, Tony, what s going on? One of the crabs got away. Come on, man, leave that alone. Hey, Isa, go and get that crab. Come on, man. Come on, man. Leave that shit alone. Come have a drink with us. RITA: Well, look who's coming now. Isn't she sweet? [WOMAN LAUGHING] Hello, am I late? Of course you're late, everything is almost done. You should have stayed home. Can I come in? RITA: Of course you can come in, of course. [WOMEN LAUGHING] She's such a child. Oh, God! So much food and so few people. We're not going to eat all that. Pigs gonna have a banquet with all those leftovers. Hey, hey. So much food for when Armandito comes over. Afterwards we'll take home the leftovers. Nothing will spoil. You've got to be with me, Margo. The campaign is almost upon us. Isa's going to be with us. Have you told her? He said he'd be here this afternoon. Probably get here tonight. I'm talking about Isa. Have you told her? Does she know? [SIGHING] Oh. Christ. [MUSIC STOPS] Isa? TONY: Hey, Armando. How much do you want for this red devil? For this animal?Yeah. I won't sell him for any money in the world. Oh, come on. [INAUDIBLE] Listen, Isa. Eliseo and I broke up. Did you hear me? I'm telling you Eliseo and I broke up. So what am I expected to do? I left home. So, you want to stay here? We always helped each other. We're cousins. Armando doesn't like any strangers staying in the house. Can't you talk to him? All right, I'll speak to him. And you can stay in the small room. Thank you. You won't regret it. [MARGO LAUGHING] MARGO: Oh, that's nice. Are you with me? Sure. Sure, I'm with you. [MARGO LAUGHING] Oh, don't rock me too hard, I'll get dizzy. [GIGGLING] Oh, my head. [SIGHING] Isa, get me the car keys. You're leaving? I've got important business. [ENGINE STARTING] [ENGINE IDLING] Isa, I found the keys in the coat. Hey, poet. Let's go. I've got a court date in the morning. What do I know about Cuba libre? MARGO: Look at them, all from good families. La creme de la creme. Serious, responsible, [MEN CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] the best. ARMANDITO: It's now or never. I stay. He asked me to do something dirty and I didn't know how to do it. Let s go in, I'll get you some coffee. [CRYING] I just feel so stupid. Oh, I feel stupid! Isa. Hello. Come on in, I'll take you home. Come on, come on. I just want to talk to you. I thought maybe you were out of town. Isa, I thought it would be nice if we could talk. We never get a chance to be alone. I thought it would be nice for us to just sit and talk to each other, woman to woman. Isa, I have a theory that a woman has a right to the truth. That if a woman is deprived of the truth, she's deprived of her freedom of choice. And I believe that everybody should be free. Don't you? Yeah. Well, there's something that I have to tell you, and... I want to be sure that you want to be told. Do you want to know the truth, always? Why are you so upset? I've brought you a clipping from yesterday's newspaper. He's a bastard, but he is like my brother. You attended the wedding? Yes. Did he ever make love to you? No. He never made love to me. He's a bastard, but not that much of a bastard. I told you he was like my brother. Isa! Don't hate me. Please. [DOG BARKING] [ISA GIGGLING] [SIGHING] [CLEARING THROAT] [SPANISH SONG PLAYING ON RADIO] [BOTTLES CLINKING] [SPANISH SONG PLAYING] [EXCLAIMS] Isa, play that song again, please. You really like that song, don't you? [SPANISH SONG PLAYING] You've fixed this house very nice. And the plants are beautiful, too. The patio at the house is nice. I'm always fixing it. The house needs some painting. Funny, Paulo never mentioned anything about it. [SCOFFS] Paulo? Paulo hasn't shown his face in the house for about six months. Drink your coffee it's going to get cold. That Cutex is beautiful. You know what? The other day the lawyer came by the house and he said they are going to put up the poles and bring down electricity! What the hell was the lawyer doing in my house? The lawyer? [STUTTERING] Obdulio, his driver, he needed some water for the car, and the lawyer came in and said hello. If you don't believe me, ask Milla, she knows. What was Milla doing in my house? Nothing, she just wanted to see me. Can I try your Cutex? Sure. You can keep it. No, no, no. All I want is just to try a little bit so I can see how it looks to me. I said, keep it. [HORN HONKING] That's Ted. I should have left before. Good, Lord. He really came in early today. Ted! All day long I've been thinking of you and wanting to be alone with you. The factory doesn't have any work, okay? Well, they don't know how to fix it. Hi. Hello, Mr. Ted. [STUTTERING] I was just about to leave. There's no problem. What brings you here? Nothing, I just came to see Isa and let her know how things are at her house. This is her house. This is your house. Excuse me. Come some other time, okay? Don't forget. Let me know what happened, okay? Yeah, I'll let you know with Paulo. Yeah, and don't forget to get my plants. I need you so much. Aren't you having any steak? No. What is that that you're eating? Pig's feet. It's very tasty. You want some? No, thank you. I'll stick to my steak. It's very nice, you'll like it. Where did you get that? Paulo got it for me when he went to town. I cooked it myself. You should have some, it's very nice. Isabel, I buy you the best food money can buy. Why do you have to eat that stuff you people eat? [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Paulo, I have a lot of work to do at the factory, so you can buy Isabel all the things that she needs for the beach. However, Dona Candida will go with her. I want you to stay at the house. You have a lot of work to do there. By the way, I bought a new pair of shoes. You can keep the old ones. Oops! [BOTH CHUCKLING] Did you take my candles to Rita? I sent Chinto's girl over. I wonder if she took them over? I've got to light my candles tonight. It's All Souls' Day. You promised you'd take them yourself! It's just that I don't like going there anymore. It is no place to send a little girl, either. What do you mean, what's going on? PAULO: Nothing's going on. It's just I don't like to go there anymore. [DONA CANDIDA SIGHS] They told me there was a big fight the other night and someone was cut. You never told me that. It's none of my business? What's going on in my house? Nothing! Nothing! It's just that there's a lot of people there all the time. You know? People always, you know... You know, having fun, you know? And how long has this been going on? A long time. But who? Who is it that goes to my house all the time? How do I know? People. You know? The friends of yours, you know, the ones that were always eating. Armando, does he go there? I don't, I... I think so. [STUTTERING] I believe so. Jesus! Isabel, what the hell are all these candles in this room for? For the blessed souls in purgatory. Well, that's all very well, but we can't burn the house down. Hey, what are you doing? Don't do that. You're not supposed to blow them out! We're not going to leave them here. You idiot! You're going to attract the evil spirits! Get out! Get out! Oh, Isabel! You can put them somewhere else. You can light candles again. It's too late! You're not supposed to put them out. They're supposed to go out by themselves, on their own. [SOBBING] My God! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. MIGUEL: I don't think I've ever seen so many people that were that emotionally involved and affected. But there's so many things to tie up. There's Isabel's money, there's the Church, now the thing with the Monsignor. If you use the program to attack the Monsignor... Oh, wait a minute. Who is going to attack who? I don't want the problem to lose credibility. Will you do me a favor, Don Pepe? You worry about the money for the program and I'll worry about the content, all right? Sincerely, Micky, the only reason I sponsor your program, it's because you are a responsible commentator. Sincerely, Don Pepe, I thought it was because I had good ratings, and it sells your product. If you start making trouble with Monsignor, I'll take away the advertising. Yeah, you're laughing because you know he can't afford to let you go. The way your ratings are today, you will get another sponsor right away. I hope you're right, my friend. I hope you're right. [TIRES SCREECHING] Isabel! Get back in the car! Get in the car! And for you! Every goddamn thing you've got, I gave you! Every bit of food you eat... Is that what you want? This peasant bastard? What the hell can he give you? [SPITTING] Ted, it's over! The hell with you! ISABEL: You hear me? It's over! All right! Live with him, goddamn it! Go live with that son of a bitch. I'm rich! I could have given you everything! To hell with you! To hell with this country! I can go home! I can make lots of money, I don't fucking need you! To hell with you! You can go to hell, you whore! You goddamn whore! [PANTING] [COUGHS] Too bad, Paulo. What a life. What a mess! [SIGHING] What do we do now? What we got to do now is move along. [SIGHING] Paulo, time passes by. What we got to learn to do is survive. [SNICKERS] Mmm-hmm. Don't be silly. You'll see, you'll see. Hey... You can still get some of that booze for me, no? Yeah, I can get it. You get it for me, and we're gonna be in business. You and I. We're gonna make a lot of money. You just get it for me. I'll take care of the rest. We're gonna make a bundle. [EXCLAIMS] [SCOFFING] I'm gonna be rich, Paulo. I'm gonna have a lot of money. [SNICKERS] Okay. Okay. [CHUCKLING] Okay. Okay. [BOTH LAUGHING] Isa... You should've let me know you were coming. Hello. From now on there are many things we have to change. Here, Margie. Isa, but are we gonna charge for it? Listen, having fun is not enough. If they want to have fun, let them pay. From now on we charge. We charge for everything. They're going to pay us? Gee, this is getting better all the time. Are you single? My man left me. Look, I want no trouble in here. You got experience? [MUTTERS] What's your name? Cornucopia. Change it. Gee, Isa, can I change my name too? I would like to be called Shirley. Yeah, like Shirley Temple! I even have the two little holes in my cheek. Just like her, everyone says so. Just like her! Isa, there is a girl who wants to talk to you. Here. What's your name? Carmen Santos. What can I do for you? I need a job. You have a family? Yes. I see. Look... I'm gonna run this place like a business. To work in here, you got to be on your toes. I understand. Oh, one more thing. No pimps. I want no pimps here. Pimps? Pimps. Who sent you here? My mother. How old are you? 22. I'll have to let you know later. Okay? Well, if you'll just say... Look, go home. I have nothing for you. I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you. What happened? Her mother sent her. There is nothing for that girl in this house. Pancho! Move that wood over here, and shine my car. I'm gonna use it tonight. Hey, did you get that man to help you guys? Yes, ma'am. Paulo, you're still working on that wall? Move along! Is she in? Isa. Isa. There she is, there's that famous lady. The whole town knows. Hell, half the island knows. Where the hell have you been? In hell. That's where some people would like to see me. Especially in the assembly. They'd like to get rid of the senator. Been reading about you. Isa, there was a warrant against you. [WOMEN LAUGHING] For running a house of prostitution. It's true, Isa. I took care of it. Isa. Let's talk some business. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Let's talk business. We're gonna find some kind of action around this town. You, but you're always complaining, you know. What you need is a little time on shore. Now, you just wait...Hey, mister. Come here, come, come, come. You want something? [STUTTERING] You know? You know? Girls. Girls. Ah, do you know where Elizabeth's Place is? Do I know where Elizabeth's Place is? This is her car. Hey, come on, you guys. Girls! Elizabeth's Place, I take you there. [SAILORS CHEERING]I take everyone. We'll go to Elizabeth's Place. Yes. We got Shirley Temple. All right! [SAILORS CHATTERING EXCITEDLY] There's beautiful girls in Puerto Rico. [ENGINE STALLING] There's beautiful girls in Puerto Rico. SAILOR: Start it up. Start it up. Come on. Excuse me, excuse me, one moment, please. Excuse me, push, please. Push, push. Push. All right, let's push this thing! You want girls. You want girls, you push. Push, push. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Let's go, swabbies! [ALL CHEERING] [SPANISH MUSIC PLAYING ON JUKEBOX] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] I'll pay you tomorrow. Tomorrow? Forget tomorrow. What do you think I'm running here? Some kind of a picnic? I pay taxes here, man! Isa, I'm an old customer here. Forget about old customer, man. You can't come here. I pay for the license here. I pay for everything, I pay my taxes. You're gonna have to pay or you're gonna have to kill me! OFFICER: Okay. Which one of you is La Negra? Why are you pushing my girls around? I am a lady. I'm here by mistake! Who sent you? Bermudez? You are under arrest. Just follow me. Follow me. Come on. [WOMEN CLAMORING] Yes, Isa, yes. At this hour? What? Yes, I know, he's another one of our enemies. Yes, a regular bastard. But listen, Isa, listen. Hold it, hold it please. He cannot do anything without the judge. No, not anything. He cannot do anything without the judge. That's all. Okay, put Bermudez on the phone, please. Bermudez. Say, do you like your uniform? Yes, sir. Are you sure? You got the mayor here. Yes, of course, the mayor. Ah, you like it. Okay, so don't do anything to Isabel. No, no, no. Not anything, nothing, nothing at all. Or we can't be in business, okay. Do you understand me? Am I clear? Okay. Now put the judge. Yes, the judge! Yes? Judge! The mayor here. Listen, have you heard about that vacancy in Vieques. Or the other one in Culebra. You heard? Why do I ask? Because it seems to me that you are, you are, you are trying to make me... Yeah, to force you to go to Vieques or to Culebra. Yes, I know you are the judge. And... And who made you a judge? Yes, I know. I know, Joaquin, I know! Okay, I can undo you and you know it. Am I clear?Yes. At 3:00 in the morning? The raid was supposed to start at midnight! I'll look after that. Okay. Am I clear? Okay, goodbye. Give my best to your wife. Bermudez, take these people to wherever they came from. They are on the top, and they give the orders, Bermudez. And I'm getting too old to be transferred! It's getting late. [SPANISH SONG PLAYING ON JUKEBOX] The attorney is in from San Juan and he wants some of your stew. Only that? Well, maybe a little bit of white flesh first. But first... Is he going to eat or... Well, yeah. But, listen, I want to meet with him and you first. And then... Okay. And where are we going to? Well, now, that's all taken care of. You are wrong, Joaquin. We can't do things like that. We have to get rid of that son of a bitch! Dinner is ready. We have to get rid of him and put one of our men in his place. Oh, stop talking. Let's have dinner. The food is getting cold. What do you want us to do, put some jerk in his place? What the hell! Do you want me to work with a judge that is an enemy of... Enemy of my administration? Oh, that's the one that issued a warrant for me. See? Your judge should know about all of the money you have been putting into our campaign. But that was taken care of. What we have to do now is see how we can make the best of it. [SHOUTING] The best of it? Let's see who has more clout, that jerk or me! Oh, you. You, Joaquin. Naturally. Oh, Isabel, this is heavenly! I made it especially for you. Armando? You're having dinner with us? No, I think I'm gonna have a drink first. Don't forget the avocado. No. Armando was telling me about some problem you have with the river when it rains. Yes, we've been having a bit of a problem there. Submit the project. I'll see what I can do. I'll support it. Rita, the wine. She left. Well, get it yourself, then. Paulo, did the delivery of rum arrive? Mmm-hmm. And the Cokes?Mmm-hmm. Okay. Paulo! And the ice. Do you have enough ice? Don't forget the cash register. You have to have enough cash in it. Hey, don't worry. I'm gonna get you an assistant. Mmm-hmm. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [SPANISH SONG PLAYING ON JUKEBOX] Hey, Isa. Come over and have a drink. Why not? Ay, sit down. I want to talk to you. [CHUCKLING] I've always been a woman of simple tastes. I'm bored by big cities. Besides being the most polite men in the world, Puerto Ricans are just charming. Come. Come with me. Are you Puerto Rican? No, I'm from Spain. Come. Hey, what's the matter? Hey, hey, hey. Hey, I'm talking to you! [WOMEN SCREECHING] The lady said no! That means hands off! [GUNSHOT] I want no trouble in this place. If you want to fight, I want it clean. [MUSIC STOPS] SAILOR 1: Get him, man.SAILOR 2: Get him. SAILOR 3: Come on, man, let's go. [PEOPLE URGING ON] Hit him! [CHEERING] Okay! Okay! The party's over! If I see you...Yeah, you bring it. I don't intend to rot here! I wouldn't like that either. Someone asked me to marry him. RITA: [SCOFFS] The Doctor? Don't believe everything men tell you. Sometimes I don't believe the things men do to me. Just because a woman of certain class is forced to do certain things, doesn't mean one is a slave. What really fucks me up is that Isa, with all her rules and regulations, doesn't want us to date our friends. It's the only way. Many men abuse women like us. The problem is we keep getting those trashy customers. Like those sailors last night. How can such handsome men be so rough? My, oh, my. I never expected those blond, blue-eyed men to be like that. Isabel should be more careful. She is drinking too much. [WOMEN LAUGHING] [SHRIEKING] Has the film gotten there yet? Tony, if the film doesn't come, I'm not gonna read it, okay? No way. Is Gadet there? No, she s not. Great. She's supposed to bring the official police report. Look, I'm gonna go with the two interviews, and the medical report. And that is the show, okay? Yeah. I have to have the film to start the show. Yeah. Hey, who killed her? How do I know? Hi. Oh, you put the pot? Mmm-hmm. Well... The travel agent, what happened? The travel agent, yeah, I saw him. And did you know that she traveled around the world twice? Did she enjoy her trips? I mean did she appreciate the historical sites, what? People say that she just wanted to have her picture taken to show off. She was a customer of that agency for 15 years. You know, the police say that she wasn't a target? That apparently somebody wanted to shoot one of the hookers and killed her by mistake. And some people say that she was just there during the shooting and she got killed by accident. They insist it was by accident. Why? Well, because they say that she didn't have any enemies. Look, all I want to do is find out who and what the lady was when she was alive. INSTRUCTOR: One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. This is a shame! We should not tolerate this. It's not that easy. We can't say no to the Army. Which one is she? What's the matter, are you colorblind? Either you throw her out, or I'll call the president. It's a shame! These are your friends. Please, come in. Sit down, sit down. Yes. Well, you know, I've been looking forward to meeting you because, well, your, what should I call it, your place is very famous outside of Puerto Rico, too, did you know that? In Cuba and Panama and, well, throughout the whole Caribbean. You're a very famous woman. ISABEL: [CHUCKLING] That's hard to believe. Well, the soldiers, when they go on leave, you know, the only thing they want to do is to go to your place. And may I say that we... Well, frankly, we are not against it. We approve. Of course, the Army has rules and these rules must be obeyed. They are rules about hygiene and personal security. You see, well, sometimes things... Well, they seem to get a little out of hand at your place and... And, well, there are fights and... Actually our boys are really fighting men, you know. [TITTERING] Well, I guess we should talk about business now. ISABEL: Yes, let's hear what you have to say. Thank you. What I'm suggesting is that you sign an exclusive contract with the United States Army and we would guarantee steady clientele and a safe business. Well, there would be protection, too. The military police would guard your establishment. [CHUCKLING] Oh. That sounds wonderful, Mr. Captain. But what about the civilians? I'm sorry? Well, can the other customers come in? The civilians? Oh, no, no, no. This would be exclusively for military personnel. You understand. Oh. I m afraid the answer is no. What? I have customers, you see. I'm sorry I don't like your offer. See, my people first. Sorry, no offense. Yes, but it's a good deal, Miss Isabel. Think about it, Isa, he's a gentleman. No deal. I'm sorry. I can't do it. Well... [SIGHING] I won't insist, but if you do change your mind in the near future, here is my telephone, and I wish you would please give me a call. Well, I think it would be a good deal for all of us. [INSTRUCTOR COUNTING] What's that? It's a cotillion, Isa, for society girls. That's how they make their social debut! [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [MEN WHISTLING] I want 20 8x10's of the best shots. The girls are wonderful. They look beautiful. Well, most of them. I am so happy you decided to come to play at my cotillion. Wonderful. Thank you. Thank you. [SIGHING] Isabel, you are a genius. You are the queen of happiness. Oh, thank you, my dear poet. You are very kind. [CHUCKLING] This is my present for you, Paulo. It belonged to the first man I truly loved. AMELIA: Here he is! Wow! Isn't he gorgeous? Isn't that a... He looks like a movie star! Look at his tie. Isn't it cute? I told you, I told you. Yellow is the best color for him. He looks terrific, he looks terrific. Yellow, that's it! Yellow does it. AMELIA: Isn't it? And it matches, and it matches. Paulo, that shirt and that tie look great. [PAULO EXCLAIMING] [ALL LAUGHING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] AMELIA: Yeah, everything should fit. I think it does. Look at that! He looks really good! Going out? Really good. We'll see. Paulo. Paulo... Got you a present. Happy Birthday. Oh! Let's see. What is it? [ALL EXCLAIMING] What're you gonna do with that? Oh, boy!I don't believe it. A bicycle! Boy! Run!It's beautiful! [SHOUTING] [WOMEN APPLAUDING] AMELIA: Careful. Now take it easy. RITA: Easy. Easy. [WOMEN CHEERING]You look beautiful! Wow! Wow, wow! [ALL LAUGHING] [WOMEN CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [SHOUTING] Isa, one of my customers last night was a detective. And as long as I couldn't ask him for any money, he gave me a tip. A blackjack. Put the radio on, I want to see if Felipe married Elenita. It isn't on today. They're having a ballgame today. Put the game on, then. I think it hasn't started. But let me see. Isa, Isa. There is a lady outside. She wants to see you. I think she is Don Geraldo Ignacio's wife. She's very angry. [SPANISH SONG PLAYING ON RADIO] Here, take this with you. Just in case. Oh, I sent Patrine to the market? Yes? Ask her where is my husband. Where is her husband? Tell her husbands are not allowed in here. Tell her she's lying. Husbands are allowed here! Tell her she is wrong. Only young men are allowed in here. This is a school for girls. School for girls, my eye! This is a whorehouse! Lady, you're making a fool of yourself. I know my husband Geraldo is inside. And I want my husband out this minute! And if you don't bring him out, I am going to bring the police! You're gonna bring the police in here? Yes, I'm going to bring the police here. Well, you bring the police in here, and you can bring the army if you want! They'll have a good time! I am going to bring the police because I want my husband Geraldo out of this place! You bitch! Let's go, Jorge! [SOBBING] Oh, no. I'm telling you I didn't get any money last night! I swear. Everything was on the house last night. We were... Scum! You son of a bitch! You bastard! Get out of here! I don't want to see no pimping in this house. You abuser! Get out of here! I don't want to see your face again around here. Dumb ass! I told you I don't want no pimps around here. I give you an opportunity to make a living and you throw it to this bastard. You loser! Get out of my sight! I told you I don't want to see any pimps around here! ISABEL: I'm gonna run this place my way. [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] I want order and discipline! Where is Maria? She should be in the kitchen. I want her to come here so she can listen to what I'm saying. Maria! Who the fuck told you to bring me any coffee? I don't want any of you fooling around with the help! This is a business, you hear me? A business! Where is Amelia? She's playing around with Paulo and the bicycle. It's nothing. Paulo's giving her a ride on his bike, that s all. [PAULO HUMMING] You stay there. [GROANS] Son of a bitch! What's the matter with you? Get the hell out of here! Get the hell out of here! What the hell is going on around here? You women! I've said again and again that if you want to stay here, you're gonna behave like decent people! You have to... [GROANING] [GASPING] You must make up your mind. Let him rot in jail. For the love of God, child, don't say that. What do you know? I'm the one who's cut up. Isabel... All right. Bail him out. Give him whatever he needs. You're very kind to me. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Goodbye, Paulo, good-bye. I'll miss you, Paulo. You were so good. [SNIFFLING] She was like a mother to me. She adopted me, and when I was seven she brought me here. My grandparents died. My mother disappeared. And then one day while I was staying with neighbors, my godfather showed up and took me to Isabel. What do you want? There's nothing for you here. Tell that broad to take care of you. Lies, lies! You understand? Jealousy, gossip! I ain't never been with any other woman, Isa. Get out. Hey... Hey, remember that kid I was telling you about? My godson? He's an orphan, Isa. No home. Manolin. He's a man already. Tell the lady your name. Manolin. I know his name already. You hungry? You shouldn't keep bad company. ISABEL: Whoops! [LAUGHING] I want to find out about Mario. I mean, I've heard a lot of things. Mario, huh?Yeah. I knew Mario. One night I was drinking with Isabel. And she told me so many things about Mario. Oh, you sweep over me, I won't get married. Hey, Isabel? How s business? Fine. Fine. Have you been there? Yeah. 10 years ago. I had a fight, you broke it up with a gun, remember? Oh! So you haven't been there for all that time? Oh. Well, there's still time. When you return, look us up. I'll buy you a drink. Sure, sure. They're letting me off in a week, you know. I'm getting off early on account of good behavior. Oh, that's nice. Well, we're down in Mayaguez. Yeah. Come on up. Look us up. The other place too small? Yeah. Yeah, I thought so. You're known the whole world over. You know, I was in Hong Kong, and this Chinese, he says to me, "Hey, I'm gonna go to Puerto Rico." You know why? He wanted to come to Isabel's place. That was about a year ago. Oh.Yeah. So, you have been in only for a short while? Yeah. [CHUCKLES] I go in and out of the Merchant Marines as if it was my own house. Must be interesting, a sailor's life. All that traveling and seeing the world. I had this one made in the Philippines. [CHUCKLING] You like it? An-gie. Do you have rum? I'd rather have rum than whiskey. You don't like whiskey? Well... Okay. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] You know what I don't understand? How a woman like you can live all by herself. [CHUCKLES] Tell me about your trips. Your wife, your children. I was married once. I had a wife. When I joined the Navy we separated. She didn't want to go on with me. So she made a film. Poor little angel. God knows what you did to her. [CHUCKLING] Yeah. Yeah, God only knows. I had a problem. Illegal possession of a gun. I did six months for it. A Luger. [SNICKERS] A what? A German pistol. Brand new. Fire a whole clip in a single burst. It was a beauty. A brand new Luger. What do you consider gave her the most pleasure? The yearly Three Kings Day parties she gives for children. That's tomorrow. Are they gonna still hold it without her? Sure. Her cousin and her family, they keep with the tradition. [CHILDREN CHATTERING] They fought a lot, but they lasted a long time together. Because he was always going back and forth in his trips. Last year, it was really something. What would you like, would you like this one? Okay. Go. And how about you, my sweetheart? Oh, that big one over there? You go over there and get it yourself. Give it to me. Oh, my God!Where's Mario? That is beautiful!Isn't he going to give us a hand? I don't know. He went out. He'll be back later. Ah, thank you. All right, what do you want? Okay, you want this big one? That's enormous. Oh, how beautiful! Isa.What? [CHUCKLING] You dirty cheat. You scum. Don't come near me again. You bastard. They respected Isabel, they had to. They didn't love her, but they respected Isabel. You know, you had to, because Isabel was a power, you know. She certainly was. What's your philosophy of life, by the way? What is it? Well, you have to survive, you know. It's very important. That's the word with you, survive. Yeah, that's what we're doing here. I know that. That's why you were the only guest that demanded cash and certain considerations. Yeah, everybody's making money out of Isabel after she's dead. You know, so why shouldn't I make money out of Isabel? Politicians do. You're making money out of Isabel. Absolutely. What are you doing here interviewing me? You know, you come here because you're being paid for this. So I'm paying for this, too. We'll be cutting to commercial, ladies and gentlemen. We'll be right back. You like it? Tastes good. It's Puerto Rican coffee. You can still get it? [CHUCKLING] It's been a long time since I thought about these things. At the beginning Isabel was... ...suspicious, stubborn, so proud. When she had her business, she was generous. She was a unique product of our Ponce society. As class-conscious, and as color-conscious as any of us. In her business she created a world where the white establishment came to her. She found a way to survive in a society that would have rejected her totally. She drifted away from me when I opposed US intervention in Vietnam. Then you must have made some enemies here in Ponce. Oh, no. I am too rich. [CHUCKLES] When was the last time that you saw Isabel? The last time I saw Isabel she was praying in front of Armando's grave. Isabel! Oh, hello. Hello. You look very well. It's been a long time. I still live in the same address. I know. I know that. Now I'm in business. I know that, too. Is that why you haven't been to the house? Of course, not. It's just that... Well, I'm not single anymore and things are different. My life is more complicated. That is exactly the reason why I have not been to your house. Well, maybe things are different for you now, but for me there's not much difference in what I did from what I do now. At least now I make my own decisions. How have you been? All right. Send in the next one. Mmm-hmm. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Monsignor. Please come in. Won't you sit down? Please. And how may I help you, my daughter? Monsignor, last Sunday you said the Cathedral needed some repairs. And honestly, it does need repairs. The church's monuments are part of our city's cultural heritage. The people must realize it is their responsibility to preserve them. Monsignor, I would like to help. It's a very expensive undertaking. Monsignor, if you would let me. But we have many people in our parish who are capable of helping with the financing. I would like to... It's a great deal of money. Please come in. The lady has a donation for our church. Thank you. Thank you, my daughter. Good afternoon, Monsignor. Is it true that people who die in mortal sin are denied the funeral services by the Catholic Church? Is it true that their bodies are buried without receiving the benefit of a last blessing? I have a case here of a young Hernan Herrera. Cause of death was certified by a forensic doctor as a suicide. Now then, as a suicide, unfortunately, didn't he die in mortal sin? Then why did the Catholic Church allow funeral services to be held in the church for this young man? Deserving, I'm sure. Why? Could it be that there is a divine law for the prominent families of this island and another for the rest of us? Hmm? What the hell is the matter with you? Nothing. The hell I know. Oh, Isa. Oh, let's go. There's nothing going on around here anyway. Come, let's go to the house. I'll give you some of that wine I brought in from Spain. You'll like it. [SPANISH SONG PLAYING] [GUNSHOTS] [DOG BARKING] [GUNSHOTS CONTINUE] [GROANING] Oh, no! Oh! MONSIGNOR: And these are the words that come to my mind today by God's will. [ORGAN PLAYING] It seems that you do not know that the unjust will not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven. There is no way out. Do not expect any hope. Know you all, that neither the fornicators, nor the adulterers, nor the sodomites, nor the effeminates, nor the idolaters, nor the thieves, nor the rapacious, nor the greedy, nor the inebriants, shall inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.
