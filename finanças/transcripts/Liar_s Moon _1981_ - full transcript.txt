Thank you Nancy. You're welcome. Well good morning, Babs. Good morning, Dr. Black. Nancy relayed your message and said you sounded a little concerned. I must say it's an unusual request, but I'll do my best to clear up any doubts, okay? Thank you. I really appreciate this. And how's my little president today? You know, your mama named you after a very famous man. Daddy, Daddy, can I take a break? Go ahead, I gotta change this bit anyway. What y'all doing out here? You looking for work? Trying to hide from it. Why, I go back home, Miles'll make me mow the yard. Mr. Jack, I got a job. Good, now you can pay me that two bucks you owe me. Yeah, old Bobby's gonna be pumping gas till he's old enough to go in the army, aren't you? Jack, we came here to make you a business proposition. Not another chain letter, Mike. No, no, nothing of the sort. Show him, Bobby. Looky here, a greased pig contest at the fair tonight and 30 bucks jackpot. I figured between the three of us, we got it sewed up. Well, what y'all got in mind? The way I see it, okay, Bobby and me will take and we'll stop everybody else from getting that chunk of ham while you, mister all—star athlete, catches it. What do you think? Sounds good. Three—way split? Yeah. Well, it was sorta my idea. I figured maybe I could get a little bonus out of it. Oh, look, Mike. Three—way split, right, Mike? Yeah, yeah, that's right. 10 bucks a piece. All right. Hello, $30-. You don't even know what day this is. I do too, it's rent day. It is not. Today happens to be our wedding anniversary.

Now you guys go get 'em, okay? Sure will, Daddy. And don't you come home all muddy like he is every night for the last 20 years. Mama, Mama, will you look, I brought some extra clothes. Well, good, use 'em. I will. The lipstick. Yup, see you later, Daddy. All right, nothing below the waist unless you plan on marrying 'em. Oh Rich ol' boy, I don't know about blind dates, especially in small Texas towns. Trust me Clifford, just trust me. Not so much, Karen. I don't wanna look like a clown. Gin, darling, you look beautiful. Look. While you were away at finishing school, I learned a lot about this sort of stuff now. You did? I'm practically a licensed beautician already. Come in. Miss Ginny, your gentleman friend's here. Oh, thank you, Pearl. Tell him we'll be right down. Right down, mhmm. ♪ All night long ♪ Oh, I can't believe—... Don't worry. If I were ever ready on time, Richard would faint. Well, if I were ready on time, I would faint. Oh. I think this dress may be a little bit too small. What are you saying? Now remember, your date's name is Clifford. He goes to school with Richard at Yale. Right. He's from New York. Gettin' it? Okay? Okay. You ready? Yes. Okay, let's go. Oh, give me a minute. Let's go! Come on. Okay, let's get our fannies to the fair. Oh, here we go again! I think they're—... Whoa! Oh, shucks. Sweetheart, couldn't you get it go a little bit longer? No, thank you. Just a little bit longer? Thank you. Was that a no? You all right? I think I'm gonna be sick. What? I think I'm gonna be sick. Well, you shouldn't have tried to smoke your pipe on the ride. I think we need something a little less strenuous than these rides. Well, how about the greased pig contest? Okay. That's worth a couple of cheap laughs. Greasy pig contest? Some rural form of amusement, I suppose. Clifford, you too. If you guys just wouldn't look down your noses at everything, you might see that culture and civilization do exist west of the Mississippi. Suey! Pig, Pig, Pig! Suey! Suey! Pig, Pig, Pig! Suey! Suey! Suey! Pig, pig, pig, pig! Suey! Suey! Suey! Pig, suey, pig! All right, folks.

Anytime you're ready, Sheriff. (gun fires Oh! Get off me you oaf! Watch where you're going! Sorry, I'm sorry I was—... Well congratulations. You've really done it this time. I can't believe you, Jack. Watch where you're going next time. Stay out there where you belong. The winner of our greased pig contest, Bubba Jones. You look fine. Well, I certainly feel much better. Listen, it's 9:30, and what would you like to do? 9:30? 9:30? Well what's the matter? Past your bedtime? No. It's just that we told Mama we'd help run the charity booth between nine and 10. Well, maybe it's just too late. Maybe we should just forget it. But Gin, don't you remember? We promised. Yeah, we did promise. Besides, it's gonna be fun. Okay, all right. I guess we better go. All right, listen. We'll go see the exhibits, and we'll meet you back at the booth around 10. Okay. Yeah, we'll go see how to grow cotton trees. All right, see ya. Right this way, ladies and gentlemen. Step right up. You got here just in time because it is showtime. Time for the biggest show on the Midway. Here we have the fabulous Broadway Burlesque Revue, 18 of the most beautiful ladies in all the world and featuring the little lady who put the smile in the Nile, King Farouk's favorite belly dancer. He loved her. He wanted to marry her. She said, Farouk you, king. And would you believe, will appear in person on the stage tonight. Now would you like to see her work? Yeah! I thought you would. Here is Queen Cleo! Isn't she lovely? Take it, mama! Woo! I knew you'd love her. Now let's hear it. Is she wonderful or not, friends, I'm asking you. Please, please, more unbelievable is the fact that you can see this presentation of popertude for just 50 cents. Jack, why pay 50 cents for a look when you can pay a quarter for a touch, huh? Ready to contribute to charity? Hey, give me my gum back. Jack, look who's here. Oh, no, it's that girl again. Come on, Jack. What are you, a man or a mouse? Oh come on, Jack. Hey, Jack. If I were you, I'd go over and apologize real proper like while Bobby and I take and spend our life earnings over there on Karen. Well what do you say? All right, let's go do it. Sure, sure. Howdy Hi. Look, I just wanted to apologize about getting your dress all muddied like that I was chasing that pig, I didn't mean—... I know. I'm sorry. That's okay, just forget it. Well. Just let me freshen up, okay? Why, I wouldn't do that for $100! Hey, get away from here. It's the guy who covered me with mud. What should I do? Well, it's simple, Gin. Does he have a quarter? Yeah. Well then kiss him. Howdy. A quarter goes along way these days, don't it, Rich? So this is what you call helping charity, huh? I can't turn my back on you for 10 minutes. Richard, it was nothing, okay? Besides, you don't own me. Nothing? You call that nothing? I don't wanna discuss it. Come on, Karen. Let's go ride while Richard grows up. Whoa! Easy. Oh, darling. Oh, I love your fancy riding. I'm so glad you're back, Gin. I haven't had anybody to ride with. Oh, gosh. It feels like I've been away from Noble forever. What was it like? Four years in a school with no boys? Well, I guess I learned a lot. I guess I missed a lot too. You know, I started seeing Richard again since I've been gone. You know, I think I prefer the homegrown variety. You know what I mean? Oh, you mean like the crazies at the pig contest? Yeah. Who was the one who covered me in mud? That's Jack Duncan. He's a dreamboat, don't you think? You know, he was practically captain of every ball team at Noble High School? Yeah, he was kinda cute. I think they're thirsty, come on. Let's go, darling. Hi ho, Silver! Dammit, Duncan, you sunk the ship! You ruined my cigar! Athlete jerk, it's my turn now. I'm gonna do a cannonball on your head! Where's Bobby? I thought he was supposed to meet us here. Yeah, well, he's always late, especially days. Why, he's practicing to go in the Army. You're kidding me. No. Hey, who's that? Shh, it's Bobby. Let's scare him. Shh. Geronimo! Oh no. Michael Miller! You maniac! You cotton picking, I can't believe you! Hey, he didn't meant to—... Come on, Dido. Look, we didn't think it was you, we thought it was someone else. Who were you expecting, President Truman? I'm sorry. Just leave me alone! I think you've done just far enough. Look. Look what? We made a mistake. You see we thought it was Bobby. We didn't know it was, here. Leave me alone! I swear, I didn't mean it. Please forgive. We were kinda playing a joke on a friend, you see? You know what, you don't have any pants on. Would you be interested in seeing a movie next Saturday night? It's John Wayne. Come on Karen. In Washington, President Truman opens the opportunity savings bond drive. Save money and strengthen America. Independence, Missouri bond launching ceremony in the Truman hometown. Treasury Secretary Snider presiding. 1949 is the 100th anniversary of the California Gold Rush, symbolized by covered wagons to be sent all over the country. The slogan bids us emulate the 49ers and seek wealth by buying bond. Ain't that the banker's daughter over there with Rich Turd? Yeah. I already noticed her. On the tide waters of Connecticut's River Thames, a spectator flotilla sets a gala scene as Harvard's superbly trained varsity eight stands ready to give Coach Tom Bowles another triumph over a Yale crew determined to break the four—year reign of the crimson sweeps. Along the shore, fully 30,000 lend vocal support to the 78th renewal of this historic rowing rivalry. Hey. Nearing the halfway mark—... Don't Richie go to Yale? Yeah. Go Harvard! Go Harvard! Come on! Get your rear out of there! Let's come on, Harvard! Go, go Harvard, get 'em! All right! Shh. Yeah! Woohoo! Yay Harvard! Yay Harvard! You're thrown out of here! Listen, ice head and four eyes! I'm gonna have you two out of here in a minute, I'm gonna have the manager down here, and both of you two are gonna be out of here. Prove it—... What in the world is going on here?! Okay, buddy, let's go. Who? Me? It was they who started the disturbance, sir. Are you crazy? Well let's all three just go. It must've been the other guy with the mohawk. My father is a very important attorney! We'll decide that in the office. Big man, let's go, let's all three. I'm gonna miss the cartoon. You are gonna be the cartoon, fatso, let's get out of here and hold it down. Just hold it down. Nazi. And let's move it on out of here. Hold it down. Move it. Hi. Mind if I sit down? Sure, have a seat. I can only stay a minute, but I'd kinda like to make peace between us. I don't think my clothes can stand anymore mud baths. Look, I'm the one that should be apologizing.

I tell you about that dream I had the other night? Now listen to this, Jack. I dreamed I was on a desert island. It was Clark Gable and John Wayne and me. All of a sudden I heard this scream, it was Lana Turner, she was on a sinking ship. She had a chicken under her arm. Name was Ralph. Wait a minute. Ralph? Ralph, is that you? That's mighty fine cooking, honey. It is. Good cooking. Cecil! She at it again? Aww, she's just a little upset. She wants to get a new dress out of that catalog and I can't afford it. Gotta get a new bit for the drill. Want another biscuit, honey? Sure Mama. What are you gonna do this afternoon? You wanna listen to those Cardinals beat those bums from Brooklyn on the radio? I can't. I met this girl at the movie theater the other night, and she invited me over. Well who might that be? Well I don't think you know her. She was at boarding school for about four years. Her name's Ginny Peterson. Alex Peterson's daughter? I guess so. I think her daddy's a banker or something. Well then it is Alex Peterson's daughter. And I can tell you, son, you're just wasting your time. Now Ellen, don't go trying to tell the boy who he can go out with and who he can't. Cecil, I know those Petersons. They're only concerned with money, and since we don't have any money, then they sure aren't gonna be concerned with us. Well all I know is Alex Peterson loaned me the money to start my business. Cecil, that is what bankers are supposed to do. And if you hadn't paid him back, it would be Alex Peterson's business now too. Well, I think you're being a little hard on him. Besides, is that any way to talk about the boy who signed your yearbook "love always, Alex?" High school was a long time ago. Thank you, Pearl. Connie, best blackberry cobbler I had since your mother died, god rest her soul. Well thank you, Danny, it is her recipe. I hope you all don't mind my dropping in unexpected—like. Danny, you know our house is your house. That's right, I did give you this house as a wedding present, didn't I? Speaking of presents. Lisa, tell me, what's this? A pony? A pony! Pearl, Pearl! I'm getting a pony! Goodness gracious. Danny! You shouldn't have. Why not? I bought one for Ginny. I don't want to show no favoritism. Alex, let's you and me go talk some business, huh? Yes Colonel. I'll get it. How are you? Hi, fine. Come on in. This okay for croquet? Yeah. Good. Let's go around back now and set up—... I didn't know what to wear. Oh, come on. I don't care what problems you've got. Sorry to bother y'all, but we're getting ready to play croquet, if you'd like to come. Not me, honey, I got some work to do. I'll be out in a minute, dear. Okay. Alex, you oughta spend more time with your children. One minute they're split—tailed babies and the next, grown up young ladies. Daddy? Yeah. Daddy, can you come out for a minute, say hello? Sure honey. Hello—... Hi, how you doing. Daddy, this is Jack Duncan. Jack, my daddy. Nice to meet you, Mr. Peterson. My pleasure. Well excuse me, I got some work I gotta finish. Okay. Bye. Well he's really busy right now. Come on. He seems nice. He is. This is a really nice house you have yourself, Ginny. Thanks. Beautiful. Well. I really enjoyed myself, Ginny. Good. Call me sometime, okay? Okay. I will-. Solong. Bye. Hey Ginny, can I see you a minute? Yeah, sure Daddy. Yes? I was just wondering. When'd you start dating that Jack Duncan? I thought you went out with Richard Thompson. I know. You sure look surprised when you saw Jack. Well, it's just that I expected to see Richard, that's all. I mean, Richard's such a nice young man. And honey, personally, I feel he's more suitable for you than the Duncan kid. Daddy, I'm a 17—year—old woman now. Please don't worry about me, all right? Hello? Hello, Babs? It's Alex. Fine. Can you talk? Good, yeah. Yeah, it has been a long time, hasn't it? Look, Babs, the real reason I'm calling is, you are aware this problem is developing, aren't you? Well, good. Look, you do what you can at your end. I'll do what I can. Okay Babs. Okay. Bye bye. No luck, huh? I left a message. Ah, don't worry about it, Jack. Women are nothing but trouble. Why, I had an uncle once whose wife gave him so much grief that he finally blowed her head off. What'd they do to him? He went to jail for two weeks! Two weeks, is that all? Then they hung him. Coke for Jack. Good afternoon, sir. Hello, Pearl. You're home kinda late today, Mr. Peterson. Yep. If it isn't one thing it's another. Yes sir. Got any messages? Only one for Miss Ginny, I left it over by the phone. All right. Pea“? Make me one of my special iced teas, will ya? Thanks sweetie.

Okay, thanks a lot. You're welcome, bye bye. Howdy. Hi Jack, what can I do for you? Well, I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by and say hi to Ginny. She around right now?

We called the skating rink at exactly 11:30. They had not seen you all night. Daddy, we didn't go to the skating rink, we—... Look, your mother's upstairs, she's worried herself sick about you. And why in the hell didn't you tell us you're going with that Duncan kid?! Daddy, it's not his fault, would you just listen—... I don't care whose fault it was. Daddy, you don't know what happened. I'm gonna tell you one thing, young lady, you're never gonna see that boy again. Would you just listen to me before you say that? You're never gonna see him again! I can explain everything, Daddy. Do you hear me? Never again! Now get upstairs. I don't understand! What don't you understand?! I thought we could talk about these things, if you would just give him a chance, maybe—... Not another word, get! Don't you just love it? Mama helped me do it just like hers. How is your mama? Oh, she's fine. She's waiting tables right now, but she might get a chance to sing in the Grand Ole Opry with Ernest Tuft. Really? Yeah. That'd be great. Not for me, though. I'm headed for the silver screen. And when I get to Hollywood, they're not gonna call me Karen Covucci anymore. They're gonna call me Karen Crystal! It's got class, you know? Well I got a smile out of you, anyway. Hey, Gin, don't worry about it. We'll just put our pretty little heads together and figure something out. Karen, my daddy won't even talk about Jack. They're so much alike, but he just refuses to see one good thing about him. So we'll just have to work around him, won't we? Let's see. Well first you're gonna have to keep up your appearances with Richard. What about the Independence Day dance? That'll be a toughy. But I'll think of something. You know, I just think we might have some good ol' boys that would just love to help us out. Okay, okay, let's go. Well of course we'd love to see Jack and Ginny get together. He's our best friend. But what's in it for us? I mean, you give a little, you get a little. It's the American way, isn't it? Just what sort of deal would y'all have in mind? You showed us your panties for a dime one time. Robert Adams, that was in sixth grade. Aww, come on, Karen. Let's go out back and see a little free show, huh? May the lord make me a leper if I lay one hand, one finger, on your luscious, beautiful body. Well I guess it couldn't hurt now, could it? Well, okay. Just, what if somebody sees us? You're crazy. Bye, see you later. Whoa whoa whoa whoa, wait. You still live with your grandma? Yeah, why? Nothing. Just, when do you usually go to bed? Oh, I suppose tonight around 10:30. And I sleep in that hot old back bedroom, you know, in the back of Grandma's house? Uh huh. That's so hot I have to keep the shades up just to get a little circulation. Bye bye, y'all. We'll see you. I sure hope so. — Ooh—ea. I wish I had a swing like that in my backyard. Bobby. Don't see a thing. You can see good from right here, I bet you can see everything. All right. What time is it? Oh yeah, let me see. Why, it's 10:30 right on the dot! Look, her right on time. She's better than the bus. Ooh, let down that hair. I know. What's next? I wonder if she's a real blonde? Oh my god.

Okay Daddy, I'll be right down. Hi Richard. Good evening, Mrs. Peterson. Hello. Beautiful flowers for a beautiful lady. Oh, thanks. They're pretty. They remind me of you, my all—American man. I got some good news for both of you. You do? Yep. I got a call from a friend of mine in New York, and Ginny's been accepted to Vasser this fall. Great! That's not far from Yale. That's quite a surprise, Daddy. Well I thought you'd love it. Don't let us keep you from the dance. No hurry to get home. Look who's here. Karen and the pigman. Hi Karen. Hi Gin, how you doing? Fine. Real good to see you. Hey, you're looking good, Rich. Thanks. You look rather special yourself. Well thank you. Y'all try that punch yet? Oh, no, we just got here. You really should, it's great. Hey Jack, why don't you go get us some more, would ya? Sure thing darling. Thank you. Well Rich, I bet you Yale men really know how to drink, don't ya? Yale, hell. What was that remark, Miller? I said Ivy League Sissies don't know nothin' about no real drinkin'. Oh yeah? Yeah.

I wanna marry you now. Oh, Jack. We talked about this before. How can we get married when my daddy won't even talk to you? Much less give us consent. Look, if we go to Louisiana or Arkansas, we ain't even gonna need your daddy's consent. And then when you turn 18 we can come back here. You mean elope? Yeah. Well what about your mother? She's got enough insurance money to last her. Afraid she's happier with money than she was with my daddy anyway. I don't know. There's so much to think about. After tonight, your daddy's bound to find out about us anyway, and then there's no telling what he'll do. Jack... I wanna-. Look Ginny, then we can leave tonight. I'm tired of slipping around here. Look, I'm tired of hiding our love. Look, I love you, I wanna shout it out to the world. I'm gonna shout it out right here. Ginny, I love you. I love Ginny Peterson. Mhmm, I love you. Jack. Tonight, let's leave tonight. Okay. Ginny. Pearl, shh! It's me, Jack Duncan. What you doing here? Shh, I can hear you all the way down the hall! What in the hell is you children up to? We're going away. Jack and I love each other very much. We wanna get married! Honey. Oh Pearl. Please don't tell anyone. Please don't tell anybody. I love him. Daddy, you being mean to Mom again? No. Mommy's not feeling very well this morning. Why don't you go on back to your room and Pearl will bring you some nice breakfast. But I don't wanna go! Did you hear your mama? Get to your room. Now! What's all this yelling about Ginny being gone? Pearl found this this morning. Sure did. Want some coffee, Colonel? No thanks, Pearl. So she eloped with Jack Duncan. Frisky little filly, ain't she? I don't find any humor in it. I think we should call the police. What's the charge, being in love? Look, Colonel, you don't understand. The Duncan boy is not right for Ginny. It won't work! We gotta stop 'em. Alex, you got a right to your opinion, however wrong you may be. Now I thought that Duncan boy was a nice young man. If you'd have given him Chinaman's chance you'd have thought so too. Let me give you some advice, Alex. Shut up, simmer down. They'll be back when they're good and ready. I'm going to work. It's about time. Hey Pearl, I'll take that coffee now. Howdy. 80 early? My, you two must really want to get married. Yes ma'am. Well. Come on in. I'll wake up the justice. Thanks. Howdy, young folks. Clara tells me you're just raring to get hitched. Well that's fine, it's a nice way to start the day. Just give me those forms there, we'll get things going, just step right up here, we can make this all nice and easy. That's it. Clara, we're waitin'!

Yes, I remember her. It was a breakfast wedding about three months ago. Ginny and Jake. Jack. Oh, Jack, Jack and Ginny, very lovely couple. And do you happen to recollect where they was headed? No, I remember he was looking for work. Do you remember where we sent that wedding picture, Clara? Down around that new pipeline, I remember that. Well, it could be La Port or it could be La Croix Parish. Why don't you try down there? Sure thing. Will do. Ginny, I'm home. Surprise! Happy anniversary! Look. You scared me. 100 candles, one for each day we've been married. You scared me. Sorry, I thought you liked surprises. I like surprises, just don't pull that one until it's our real 100th anniversary. Okay. Make a wish. Okay. Okay? Come here. Sit down. Undo these. No, it's not what you're thinking. Ah. It's a shirt. Oh. Where'd the collar go, though? Well, Arla hasn't taught me how to make a collar yet. Well, I love it anyway. You do? I got something for you too. I was saving it for your birthday, but since, down here. Jack! Oh, Jack. It's gorgeous. I love you, little lady. You made me the happiest girl in the whole world. You mean that, really? Yeah, really. Well, I don't know, you gave up a lot for me. I know. But that was the best decision of my life. Especially now. Why especially now? Well. 'Cause I think I'm gonna have a baby. But, what, a baby, what? A baby, a baby? Yes. A baby! You're beginning to sound a bit like Bobby! A baby. Me and you. Yes. Now don't get too excited yet. I already seen a doctor, and we should know pretty soon. Baby. There's a Dr. Black calling long distance from Texas. He says it's important. Hello. This is Dr. Mullen. Oh yes. Did you get my request for Ginny's medical records? What? Are you sure? Yes, the results are positive, she's pregnant all right. Mhmm. Yeah. I guess that's the only thing we can do. As soon as possible. Thank you Doctor. Mary. Get Ginny Duncan over her right away. Ginny, afraid I've got some very bad news for you. I'm not pregnant. Nope, trouble is you are. Lam? Well I don't understand. I don't know how to say this, but, you cannot have this baby, because your father, Alex Peterson, is also the father of your husband. No. Doctor, I love my husband. I want to have a family! You're lying. You're lying! My daddy put you up to this, didn't he! No. I wish to god I was lying, but I'm not. Oh my god. Can't you do something? Can't you fix it so that I don't have any more babies so I can stay with my husband, please?! In Louisiana, only a few things are illegal, but incest is certainly one of them, and we're going to have to terminate the pregnancy and then you can see about annulling the marriage. I have to talk to Jack. I have to talk to my husband. Since you're underage he's gonna have to sign the forms anyway. Tell you what, give you a couple of hours while I set up for the operation over at the clinic. That's all the time we can have, because you're almost three months pregnant, and it gets more dangerous for you every day. I'm gonna talk to my husband. Okay? I'm gonna talk to Jack. Hello? Dr. Black please. Yeah. Hi! Doc Black? This is Ginny Peterson. I have to know. Did you talk to a Dr. Mullen? Is it true? Is it true? Oh my god. Come on in, Alex. Sit down. I made you a drink. No thank you. Look, what is it you couldn't tell me over the phone? Are they all right? Where are they? Jack and Ginny are in Mentir, Louisiana. Now I just talked to Dr. Black on the phone, and he was contacted by a Dr. Mullen in Mentir. Why a doctor? It seems that Ginny's pregnant. I prayed this wouldn't happen. She gonna have to get an abortion? There won't be an abortion, Alex. Are you crazy? Oh no, I'm not crazy. I'm just very selfish. And very, very stupid. What in heaven's name are you talkin' about?! God knows I've wanted to tell you this so many times before, Alex, but I just never could do it. What? Jack, he's not your son. What do you mean? Not my son. I lied to you. I lied to you, Alex. Jack is really Cecil's son. But the test. Dr. Black confirmed Jack wasn't Cecil's son. So he's gotta be mine! No! No he's not, and that's the truth of it. Do you remember Nancy, my friend that worked for Dr. Black then? She switched the files, Alex. Your blood type for Cecil's. Dr. Black never knew anything about it. But why? Huh? Why'd you do it? I gave you everything, Alex, and you took it, and then just like that you left me for Connie Tubman and all her money. Only thing you left me with were my dreams. You always did dream too much. You loved me, Alex. For almost 20 years you let me believe that Jack is my son. Huh? Can you imagine the guilt I felt? The pain, the suffering? Of not being able to acknowledge your own son? Can you imagine that?! And now I got my daughter out there, being hunted down like a wild animal! But I loved you! Damn you, I still do! Oh! I pity you, Babs. I pity you. Well, did you at least tell the doctor the truth? I thought I should tell you first. I'll call him. No telling what them kids might do. Dr. Brian Mullen's office. Yes? Oh yes, Mr. Peterson, Ginny should be here soon. Mhmm. Mhmm. I'll tell the doctor right away. Oh, he'll be so glad to hear that. Thank you for calling. Bye. Ginny Duncan's father just called, it's all some big mistake! Who is it? Lora Mae? It's Ginny. I gotta talk to you right away. Hi honey. I'm sorry. You told me once about a woman helped some of the girls you worked with. She wasn't a nurse. And she fixed girls so that they didn't have babies, remember? Yeah. What's that got to do with you? I need her help. What? You wanna get your tubes tied? Oh, Lora Mae. I found out that Jack and I are related. Honey. We can't have any babies. I gotta get sterilized. We can adopt babies. We can go away. And Jack doesn't have to know. I don't want to lose him, Lora Mae. Gotta help me. I'm gonna help you, honey. I'm gonna help you, I know what to do. Oh Jack? Jack, just a minute. I'm worried about Ginny. Why, what's the matter? Well, she came back from the doctor all pale and upset looking. Said something about, there wasn't any baby. Oh no. And that's not all. She went upstairs and had a long talk with Lora Mae. And then afterward, they came down and they drove off together. Do you know where they went at all? No, I don't. I don't. But oh, the nurse called, and she said that Ginny would not need an abortion. Abortion? Howdy. Sorry, we have no rooms. Oh, I wasn't looking for no room, ma'am, see I'm trying to locate Jack and Ginny Duncan, and I was told they were living here. Oh. Ah, but of course, they were living here. But about one week ago, they moved on. I think it was to Florida or California, or one of those states that grow little oranges. Right, right. Well I don't care what you say. That darn kid nearly ran me off the road! Say, listen, I'm looking for a friend of mine. Jack Duncan. Speak of the devil. We just saw him down on the bridge road driving like a maniac. Well hi there, darlin'. Where's Lora Mae? She's busy upstairs. Wait a minute, you can't go up there! Lora Mae, where's Ginny? Oh, hello Jack. What happened, where's Ginny? I don't know, I haven't seen her. You're lying to me. I want to know where Ginny is. Jack. What a woman does with her body is her own business. She's my wife and I want to know where she is, Lora Mae. All right, Jack. She's at the old midwife's place. She told me you're related, she's getting rid of the baby. Ginny! Oh my god. She's bleedin' bad inside. I swear I done the best I could! You better get her to a doctor quick! Oh god! I didn't want to lose you, I did it for you. You'll never lose me, Ginny. But Why'd you go there? I was gonna fix it sol wouldn't have any more babies. But why? Because you're my brother. That was a big lie, Ginny, it's one big lie! No. We can go away. No one will ever have to know. We can adopt babies. I want to adopt babies. Ginny, Ginny. Come on, kid! Come on! Okay, hot rod. Get out! What do you want? Her. I've been chasing her clear across two states! She's hurt, and I gotta get her to a doctor. Oh, sure you do. I wasn't born yesterday, kid. Look, she's bleeding inside! She can see a doctor back in Noble. Jack! Jack! He's just knocked out, we'll take his car. Scalpel, Doctor-. I got it. No matter what happens, I know one thing. We'll never turn out like y'all. I'm sorry, son. I didn't mean to hurt anybody. Ginny taught me about love. Y'all taught me about lying. I love you Ginny, god. Hi. Hey. We're gonna be happy together. Hell yeah. We'll be happy together. Oh gosh. I love you more than anything else in the world. I love you too, Ginny, you know that.
