Now go get screwed. Hey, kid, this is no time to be antisocial. There's a war on. What's a good-looking American boy like you doing with these beaners? Dodging the draft? They're gonna kill us all. Look, I can't believe it, Hank. Are they really gonna pin us with a murder rap? Hey, look. I got a wife and kid, ese. "Zoot-suited goons of Sleepy Lagoon"? Hey, that ain't bad, ese. Listen to this pip-squeak. About the biggest heist he ever pulled was his tootsie roll. Here's your tootsie roll, ese. Hey, why don't you vatos knock it off! Pachuco Army is falling apart, ese. You better do something. I don't need your advice. The last time I listened to you, the bulls gave me the saps. What did you expect, a parking ticket? Mira, ese. The d.A.'S indicted the whole p inche gang for murder. All except for little brother Rudy. He was at the Sleepy Lagoon too, throwing chingazos. The cops don't know that. They got ways of finding out. Guacha! Cop. Hi, boys. The name's George shearer. Your, uh, parents retained me to handle your case. Do you mind if we sit and talk about it a little bit? Po'ngase trucha. Este me huele a chota. Uh, did you... You say to sit down? Thank you. Uh... Uh-huh. Well, first thing we better do is get your names straight. Let's see here. Who's José Castro? Right here. Ismael torres. Yeah, that's me. But they call me Smiley. "Smiley"? Oh, I see. Uh, you must be, uh, Thomas Roberts, huh? I ain't zoot suit yokum. Well, that makes you Henry Reyna. So what if I am? Who are you? I told you. The name's George shearer. I'm a people's lawyer, Henry. A people's lawyer? Pues, Simon, ese. We're people. At least they didn't send no animals' lawyer. So what does that mean? You work for free, or what? That's really none of your damn business, is it, Henry? But for what it's worth, I'll tell you a little story. The first murder case I ever tried... And won, incidentally... Was for a Filipino. I was paid exactly $3.50 plus a pack of lucky strike cigarettes... And a note for a thousand dollars. Never redeemed. Does that answer your question? Yeah, well, how do we know you're really a lawyer? Well, you think I'm a cop? Maybe. What are you trying to hide from the cops? Murder? Sabes qué, Mr. Shearer? Don't do us any favors. All right. All right. You want another lawyer. All right. I'll talk to the public defender's office about it. Wait a minute, ese. Where you going? Del cincho se le va a volar la tapa. All right. Come on, kids. Come on! Cut the crap! All right. All right! It's fine. It's fine. Everything's fine. Thank you. I think you're making a big mistake. I wonder if you, uh, know who your friends really are. You realize that you boys are facing a mass trial? Any of you know what that means? You're all going on the block together, the whole so-called 38th street gang! The DA's charging conspiracy, Henry! He's gonna put you and all your buddies right in the gas chamber. - But we didn't do nothing! - Simon. We're innocent. On the level. Okay, say we believe your people's lawyer stuff. What does that prove? The press has already tried and convicted us. You think you can change that? I honestly don't know. But public opinion comes and goes, Henry. What matters is our system of justice. I happen to believe that it still works, no matter how slowly the wheels grind. Now I promised your parents the best defense that I'm capable of. The question is, uh, Henry, will you trust me? Chale! We need a lawyer, ese. You expect us to defend ourselves? What difference does it make? "What difference does it make?" Whose pinche side are you on anyway? The side of the heroes and the fools, Hank. Which one are you? - You're on. - Hey, good. Same here. It's about time. All right. Now let's get to work. Now, I want you guys to tell me exactly what happened, right from the beginning. Well, rafas pushed Rudy... the pedo really started at the dance... Last Saturday night. ♫♫ [Man I orale, little dude.

You better go back to Downey, ese, before you regret it. Don't let him tell you that, ese. Toma, ese! That's what I think of your puta Navy, Army and Marines. What are you gonna do about it?

Hello, my name is Alice bloomfield, and I represent the congress of industrial organizations. Okay. So? Henry, I'm here to offer you... The support of the working people. And you're gonna need the support of the working people, Henry, because the press has been saying that this pachuco crime wave... That this pachuco crime wave is fascist-inspired. Can you beat that? No. They claim it's sinarquismo. Sinar qué? Sinarquismo. "A fifth column fascist movement dancing to tunes played by Rome, Tokyo and Berlin... As relayed through Mexico City." Did you ever hear of it? This one's all yours, ese. Look, lady, I ain't stupid, but I don't know what the hell you're talking about. I'm talking about you, Henry, and what the daily press has been saying about you. Are you aware you're in here... Because some big shot up in San simeon wants to sell a few papers? It's true. So what? So he's the man that started all this Mexican crime wave stuff. You get the picture? Somebody's using you as a patsy. Who you calling "patsy"? I meant a political victim. What do you mean "victim"? Uh, look, let's back this whole thing up and start all over again, okay? Henry Reyna, hello? My name is Alice. I'm with the c.I.O. Puro pedo. She's nothing but a dumb broad, only good for you-know-what. Vémonos. Look, thanks a lot, miss bloomfield, but I'd rather be left alone, all right? Wait a minute. Please. I'm someone who wants very much... To be your friend. Can you believe that? Why should I? Because I'm with you. Yeah? Well, how come you ain't in jail with me? We're all in jail, Henry. Some of us just don't know it. Alice? Hey, George. What the hell are you doing here? Never mind. I should know better than to ask. Have you two met? I introduced myself. Twice. Oh, figures. Figures. Alice has volunteered to help me in this case, Henry. She's gotta be the most red-hot organizer the c.I.O.'S ever had. George, that's a lot of red-hot... You-know-what. You see what I mean? Well, you two have a lot of work to do, and my ego is killing me. Oh, whoa, Alice. Just a minute. I'll be right with you. Guard. Well, Henry, uh, tomorrow's the big day. Anything you need? Anything I can get for you besides clean clothes? Some socks. Some undenivear. I can't go to court looking like this. I want you to, uh, take a look at this, son. Lilegitimi non carborundum. That's Latin for "don't let the bastards get you down." Excuse me, um, do you have a light? Sorry, there's no smoking here. Trust me. Thanks a lot. Thank you. I didn't even see it. All right. Come on, Alice. Let's scram. Good luck, Henry. We're gonna beat this rap. "Good luck, Henry. We're gonna beat this rap." You really think you stand a chance, ese? Yeah, I think I stand a chance. 'Cause that white broad says so? Nel, ese. Because Hank Reyna says so. The political patsy, huh? Mira, ese. Hank Reyna's no loser. I'm gonna come out of this thing on top. Me entiendes, Méndez? Don't try to out-pachuco me, ese. Pues, we'll see who comes out on top. Let's go to court. The superior court of the state of California... In and for the county of Los Angeles, department 43. The honorable f.W. Charles presiding. All rise. Please be seated. Call this case, bailiff. "The people of the state of California versus Henry Reyna", Ismael torres, Thomas Roberts, Joey Castro... And 18 other 'pa-coo-cos. Uh, your honor, it was reported to me on Friday that the district attorney... Had absolutely forbidden the sheriff's office to permit these boys clean clothes or haircuts. Now, your honor, it has been two months since these boys were arrested. Your honor, the boys of the 38th street gang... Are characterized by their haircuts. Two months, your honor. The thick, heavy heads of hair, the ducktail comb, the pachuco pants. You're trying to make these boys look disreputable, like mobsters! Yet clothes like these are being worn by kids all over america. The zoot clothes seem to be necessary... For purposes of identification of the defendants by witnesses. I don't believe we'll have any difficulty if they get a little dirty. What about their haircuts, your honor? They didn't go to jail looking like marines, Mr. Shearer. Their hair was long to begin with. It's a little late to try to change their tonsorial appearance. You may call your first witness. The prosecution calls sergeant frank galindo... Of the Los Angeles police department. Sergeant frank galindo of the Los Angeles police department. Look at your gang, ese. They do look like mobsters. Se guachan bien gacho. Place your left hand on the Bible. Raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to tell... come on, vato. Sit up. I'm tired, Hank. My butt is sore. Yeah. Look at the soft chairs the jury's got. Hank is right, vatos. We look bad. Mas alba nalga, ese. Put some class on your ass. Céllate El hocico! Sit up. Come on. Sergeant galindo, were you the first officer to arrive at the Williams ranch... Near the so-called Sleepy Lagoon... On the night of... or the early morning of August 1, 1942? Yes, sir. I got a call saying that there was a disturbance there... Stemming from a birthday party. When I arrived, I found the body of José Sanchez. [D.a. I you, uh, talked to the mother of the deceased in Spanish. Yes. That's correct. She told me it was her birthday party. She said a gang of pachucos attacked the ranch about 1:00 am. Henry Reyna and his 38th street gang. Objection, your honor. The use of the word "gang" is prejudicial to my clients. Objection overruled. "The Caucasian, especially the anglo-Saxon youths", when engaged in fighting, will resort to fisticuffs... And may at times kick each other, which is considered unsportive. But this Mexican element... Considers all this to be a sign of weakness, and all he knows and feels... Is a desire to use a knife to kill, or to at least let blood. "This inborn characteristic comes down from the bloodthirsty aztecs." Objection! Objection, your honor! Objection overruled! I move that this entire report be stricken from the record! You're out of order, Mr. Shearer! Objection overruled. You may proceed. "And when added to the use of liquor or marijuana", then we certainly have crimes of violence." Mmm, pues. Put on your feathers, ese. Ya te chingaron. ♫♫ ♫ mari-mari-juana ♫ ♫ mari-mari-juana boogie ♫ ♫ mari-mari-juana ♫ ♫ mari-mari-juana boogie ♫ ♫ mari-mari-juana ♫ ♫ that's my baby's name ♫ ♫ put on your drapes, ese, vato ♫ ♫ make those calcos shine ♫ ♫ ooh-wop ♫ ♫ ahhh ♫ ♫ put on your drapes, ese, vato ♫ ♫ make those calcos shine ♫ ♫ ooh-wop ♫ ♫ ahhh ♫ ♫ they're holding court on the corner ♫ ♫ marijuana boogie time ♫ still feeling patriotic, ese?

Something inside you craves the punishment, the public humiliation... And the human sacrifice? But there's no more pyramids, carnal. Only the gas chamber. But I didn't do it, ese. I didn't kill anybody! ♫ I got a woman named juana ♫ ♫ juana, juana, juana ♫ ♫ juana ♫ ♫ but all the men she made love to ♫ ♫ they call her ♫ ♫ marijuana ♫ [Together I ♫ mari-mari-juana ♫ ♫ that's my baby's name ♫♫ ♫♫ [ends j who knows, ese? Maybe your little chick can save your cachetes. Guacha! Tu huisita, carnal. ♫♫ ♫♫ After the dance that Saturday night, Henry and I drove out to the Lagoon... Around 11:30. There was a new moon out that night. As we got to the Lagoon, we noticed right away the place was empty. - That's it, baby. - It's beautiful. It's just a reservoir. At least at night you can't see the tires and tin cans. Come here. Come on. It was such a beautiful night, and the sky was so full of stars. We couldn't just sit in the car. So we got out to look at the Lagoon. Neither of us said anything at first. So the only sounds were the crickets and the frogs. ♫♫ Then we began to hear music. What's that? It sounds like a party. Where? Over there at that ranch. See the lights on the shacks? Oh, yeah. Ah, jijo. Sound like some party. Do you want to crash it? Chale. I promised to keep you out of trouble, remember? My father. He makes me feel like a nun sometimes. You know, you're the first guy he's let me go out with... alone. Maybe he knows what he's doing. A lot of guys don't know how to respect a girl. Go ahead, ese. Pop her cherry. You know she wants it. What's wrong? Your old man and my old man. I don't like shotgun weddings, esa. Hank, I'm almost 18. You're going off to war, and I love you. Not here, esa. Any place but here. Too many memories of Bertha? What do you want to bring her up for? I, uh... Do you want to be like her? Is that it? Huh? Well, get in the backseat. Come on. Get in the backseat. What, Hank? Come on. You must really think I'm a square. I'm sorry, Della. I was just trying to prove a point. I don't want to go to jail for statutory rape. Why does everything have to be a crime with you? Can't you just love somebody? Just then another car pulled up to the Lagoon. We thought it was Tommy and lupe and the rest of the gang, but it wasn't. Come on, ese. Let's see what you're made of. Come on! Let's go, ese. Come on, ese. Toma, ese! You better stay here. Hank? Stay here. Qué se traen? Come and find out, puto! Come on, ese! Let's play some baseball! Stay here! Rafas and his gang left, heading for the party at the ranch, and I held Henry in my arms until he came to. The first thing he said was... "Let's go into town and get the guys." ♫♫ [ "In the mood" j Come on, 38th! It took about an hour to go into town and come back. We parked by the Lagoon and walked toward the ranch. The lights were still on, but the place looked deserted. Orale pues! Pues, qué Paso', ese? I thought you said the joint was jumpin'! Is this your idea of a big party? I'm gonna take care of that pinche rafas for good! Ay, go to sleep, Rudy! Shut up. Looks like the party's over, Hank. You see any signs of rafas? Nel, ese. They're gone. Then let's go to Downey and get 'em! Chale! ya estuvo. Everybody, go home. Go home? Put the car tools away. Go home! Vémonos. Get in the car. Listen to what he says, Rudy. ♫♫ That's when we heard music coming from the ranch again. We didn't know rafas and his gang... Had been kicked out of the place for starting fights and causing more trouble. So when Joey said... Orale pues! The party's still got life in it! They're dancing to records. Orale. Come on, ese. They all went there yelling and laughing. Let's go! Come on. At the ranch, they saw us coming... And thought we were the Downey Gang coming back again. They attacked us. An old man ran out of the house with a kitchen knife, and Henry had to hit him. And then some girl grabbed me by the hair, and in a second, everybody was fighting and yelling. Come on! Before we got to the cars, [saw something out of the corner of my eye. It was a guy, and he was hitting a man on the ground with a big stick. And Henry yelled at him. Come on! Come on! But he wouldn't stop. He wouldn't stop. He wouldn't. Your witness. Hey, your honor, the jury's getting... It has been brought to my attention... That the jury is having trouble telling one boy from another. So I'm going to rule that the defendants will stand... Each time their names are mentioned. Objection, your honor! If the prosecution makes an accusation, it will appear to be self-incrimination. Not necessarily. You may cross-examine, Mr. Prosecutor. Ready for the verdict now, ese? Chale. [ D.a. I miss barrlos, are you deliberately... Concealing evidence from this court? No. Are you covering for Henry Reyna? - Please stand. - No. Then who was this guy you saw beating another man on the ground? It wasn't Henry. He was standing right beside me. We were just defending ourselves... I didn't ask for your comment. Why don't you ask me about the Downey Gang? Just answer my question! But they attacked the party! Maybe José Sanchez was already dead! Your honor, will you instruct the witness to be cooperative? I must caution you, young lady. Answer the questions, or I will hold you in contempt. [D.a. I sit down. Now, miss barrlos, if your boyfriend wasn't the guy with the big stick, who was it? It was too dark to tell. How big a stick would you say it was, Miss Barrlos? As big as this one? Objection! Your honor, no such club was ever found. The prosecution is implying... your honor, I'm not implying anything. I'm merely using this stick as an illustration. Objection overruled. - Could it have been a lead pipe? - No. How about a Blackjack? A heavy chain? No. No! A baseball bat? No! Did your boyfriend run over to José Sanchez, hit him on the head and kill him? He could hardly walk. How could he run any place? Did Smiley torres? Did Joey Castro? No. No. Did Tommy Roberts? Did Henry Reyna? No. No. Henry Reyna! Henry Reyna! Henry Reyna! Did Henry Reyna willfully murder José Sanchez? No! No! - No. - ♫♫ A-hoo-ah! Ah-ha-ha-hi! Whoo-hoo! A-hoo-ah! ♫♫ - Objection! Objection, your honor! The prosecution is pulling out objects from all over the place, objects that were never found at the Sleepy Lagoon, objects that have never been proven... To be associated with my clients in any way whatsoever. Objection overruled. If the court please, I wish to make an assignment of misconduct by the bench. Quite frankly, Mr. Shearer, I'm getting rather tired of your repeated useless objections. I have not made useless objections. I'm sorry. Someone is using ventriloquism. We have a Charlie McCarthy using Mr. Shearer's voice. I'm going to assign that remark of your honor as misconduct. Fine! I would feel rather badly... If you did not make an assignment of misconduct at least twice every session. You'll have them, your honor. How would you like to get slapped with a citation for contempt, Mr. Shearer? Witness is excused. However, I'm going to remand her... To the custody of the ventura state school for girls... For a period of one year... What? To be held there as a juvenile ward of the state. - Bailiff. If the court please... If the court please... This court is in recess until tomorrow morning. I'm sorry about Della, Henry, and I'm afraid it was my fault. I shouldn't have antagonized the judge. I thought you said we had a chance. Now listen to me, son. This case is going to be won... On appeal. Appeal? What did I tell you, ese? You mean you know we're gonna lose? It's not unusual, Henry. It happens all the time. Don't you see, Henry? Judge Charles is hanging himself as we go. I've already cited over a hundred separate cases of misconduct by the bench. It's all going into the record. Prejudicial error, denial of due process, inadmissible evidence. Sabes qué, George? Don't give me any more of your shit. Henry. Is there anything I can do? Ready now, ese? Simon. Then let's have it. Has the jury reached a verdict? We have, your honor. How say you? We find the defendants guilty of murder in the first and second degrees. Ay, hijo. Hijo de mi vida. The defendants will rise. Henry Reyna, José Castro, Thomas Roberts, Ismael torres. You have been tried by a jury of your peers... And found to be guilty of murder in the first and second degree. The barrio needs you, ese. The law prescribes the capital punishment for this offense. Fight back. Stand up to them with some style. However, in view of your youth... Show the world Hank Reyna has some balls. And in consideration of your families, it is hereby the judgment of this court... and remember, pachuco yo, ese. That you be sentenced to life imprisonment... And sent to the state penitentiary at San Quentin. 24-528. Torres. 24-527. Roberts. 24-526. Castro. 24-525. Reyna. "" Los Angeles, California, may 5, 1943. Dear boys, announcing the publication by mimeograph of the appeal news, your very own newsletter, to be sent to you twice a month... For the purpose of keeping you reliably informed of everything: The progress of the Sleepy Lagoon defense committee... We have a name now... and, of course, the matter of your appeal. We are going to stand beside you until your names are absolutely clear. I swear it. Viva... El cinco de Mayo. Your editor, Alice... "Bloomfield." ♫♫ Hey, boys. Orale, Alice. How's things in L.A.? Any good news about the appeal? How's my wife? One at a time, guys. Tommy, this is for you. It's from your mother. Careful. I think it's a cake. Orale. And this is cigarettes. Oh, wh... And "love from Elena." These are for Henry. And that... is for Joey. Oh, wow. Thanks, grandma. You mind if I call you grandma? No, I don't think so. I like your zoot pants. Ah, bonaroo, huh? Solid! Eres una ruca de aquellas. I'm a what? A ruca. A fine chick. De aquellas. De aquellas. Oooh, all reet, esa. Hey, look, miss bloomfield. I don't want my wife going around begging. Oh, it's not begging. It's fund-raising. I don't care what you call it. I don't like it. There's no shame in asking for money for a good cause. It's not our custom. If that's what it's gonna take, then count me out. Smiley, wait a minute. Okay. It's not your custom. I won't ask your wife to go door-to-door, okay? So where's Henry? Isn't he joining us? He couldn't make it. Why not? Look, that's his business. Leave him alone. I'm afraid I can't do that, Smiley. It's not my custom. Joey, what's going on? Okay, Tommy, give. Don't look at me, doll. Tommy, I didn't come here to do anything but bring a few letters and... No. Listen, Alice. I know what you're trying to do for us, and that's reet, see? Shit. Most paddles would probably like to see us locked up for good. Now I'm in here because I hung around with Mexicans, but I grew up with these vatos, and I'm pachuco too, see? Simon, esa. You'd better learn what it means to be chicano, and I mean p.D.Q. Hello, Henry. I'd like to talk to you in private. You vatos want any of this okie corn bread? Orale. "Paddy cake," ese. Mmm. Mmm. All right, ese. That's good. What can I do for you? For me? Ni madre. I don't understand. I'm dropping out of the case, Alice. You're what? You heard me. I'm bailing out, esa. Getting out of the case. Henry, you can't. Why can't I? Because you c... you can't. What about George and your family... And all the people in the barrio who've given their time and money in the last few months? You can't just quit. Oh, no? Just watch me. Henry, if you felt this way before, why didn't you tell me? Well, why didn't you ask me? But you've seen me coming and going. I've been writing to you, speaking for you, traveling up and down the state. Nothing has come before my attachment and my involvement... And my passion for this case. My boys have been everything to me. "My boys"? "My boys," Alice? What the hell are we, your personal property? Well, let me set you straight, lady. I ain't your boy, sabes? You know I never meant it like that. You're just a white broad using Mexicans to play politics. Congratulations, Henry. That's the worst thing that anyone has ever said to me. Why don't you go help the colored people? Why don't you go to hell? You know, you really oughta try... Working at the Sleepy Lagoon defense office for a few months. All the petty arguments and the haggling and the lack of cooperation... "You're too sentimental and emotional about this, Alice." "You're too coldhearted, Alice." "Alice, you're collecting money and handing it over to the lawyers... While the families are going hungry? Alice." "Alice, they say you can't be trusted 'cause you're a communist... 'Cause you're a Jew, Alice." Okay. That's the way they feel about me? The hell with them. I hate them too. I hate their language, I hate their enchiladas, and I hate their goddamn Mariachi music! You all right, miss? Yes. I'm fine. Oh. Oh. You got a lot of guts. No one's ever talked to me like that before. Yeah, well, you gotta watch out for us white broads, ese. I take it back. All right? I said a few things too. I don't really hate enchiladas. It's huevos rancheros I can't stand. Mmm, pues. How about huevos pachucos? So... What do we do now? You tell me. Can we go on with the appeal? Okay. Good. And now I... I was wondering if... You would do something very special for me. Write an article. No, I'm serious. I'll get it published. Article? Pues, who told you you could write, ese? Chale. The guys would razz me silly. I can't write. Puro pedo. I've seen the letters you write to your family. Come on, Hank. What do you say? Where's the old pachuco spirit? Right here, and I say puro pedo. Look, can't we just start by writing each other? I mean, in private. Of course. That's a... That's a wonderful idea. Then it's a deal? Deal. I think that we're going to be very good friends. You think so? I know so. Time, miss. Gotta go, boys. Say hello to berti for me, will you, grandma? And my wife, Elena. - And give my love to Lupe, eh? - Time! I gotta go. We'll see you, grandma. I love you! Tough luck. She loves me. Chale, ese. She loves me, ese. She told me. Oh, come on. Pendejo. Pinche puto. So you got yourself a pen pal, huh? Don't lean on me, ese. You're going stir-crazy, carnal. Why don't you just let manuela stroke you and get it over with? Este vato. That ruca's never gonna see you as a man anyway. You know what they say, carnal.

Your, uh, Jewish broad's here again. Hi, licha. Hello, Henry. I went to ventura. I've seen Della. Aren't you gonna ask me how she is? Yeah. How is she? She looks fine. She's, uh... She's very strong. I hate it when you do that to me. Half the time I don't know who I'm talking to. Why didn't you answer my letters, Alice? Nobody ever wrote me love letters before. I'll keep them, Henry, but I can't answer them. I can't. I can't be your mother or your sister... Or your huisa... Or your white broad. Nobody's asking you to be a white broad. I don't know who to be for you. Tu sabes, Hank? No. I am Alice bloomfield. I'm a person, just like you. We... When... when we win this appeal, you get to go home, and I get to go on to the next fight. That's who I am. And if I lose sight of that, then I don't know what I'm doing here. Thanks a lot, miss bloomfield. If you walk out on me this time, I won't stop you. Ahi te guacho. Bye, Hank. "Licha," huh? Qué gacho, ese! That ruca really put it to you. Sabes qué, ese? Ya callate el hocico. You know what your problem is, Hank? You can't stand yourself, and you can't stand me telling you. Shut up, ese. San quilmas was made for self-victimizing suckers like you, Hank. Underneath that big, tough bullshit exterior you put on... Is a little snot-nosed Mexican kid... shut up. Begging for the gringos' attention. Shut up. You turned yourself into a target, ese, a willing victim of the pinche racists, and they threw your ass in prison for life. Shut up! All right. New work assignments. Everybody report to the Jute Mill. Let's go! What's the matter with you, Reyna? Got lead in your pants? I said let's go. We're supposed to work in the mess hall. You've got a new assignment. Since when? Since now. Get going! Come on, Hank. Yeah. Be cool, ese. Let's go, ese. Does the warden know about this? What the hell do you care? You think you're something special? Come on. Move it, greaseball. Make me, you white paddy bastard. Back. Back off. Back off! Don't be stupid. All right, Reyna. You got solitary. I'd say about 90 days. Where in the hell you been, ese? Solitary. They gave me solitary. Only this reality is real now, Hank. Only this place is real... Sitting in the lonely cell of your will. Guacha. Each second is a raw drop of blood from your brain... That you must swallow, drop by drop. And don't even start counting, ese, or you'll lose your mind. Where am I, ese? What am I doing here? You're here to learn to live with yourself, Hank. You're a marijuana dreamer, floating in an endless night of unfulfilled fantasies, and there is no time. I'm Henry Reyna, ese. Hank Reyna! A dream, carnal. Just a dream. My family. I gotta think about my family. - Mi hijo. - Mi hijo. Mis jefitos. My carnalillo. My sis. Forget them. Forget them all. Forget your family and the barrio beyond the wall. There's still a chance I'll get out. Fat chance, ese. I'm talking about the appeal! And I'm talking about what's real. Pues, qué traes, Hank? Haven't you learned? Learned what? No court in the land's gonna set you free. You're in here for life, vato. The moment your hopes come crashing down, you'll find yourself on the ground, foaming at the mouth, como loco. Sabes qué, ese? I got you all figured out. I know who you are, carnal. You're the one that got me here. And you know what? You're me. My worst enemy... And my best friend. Myself. So get lost. Get lost! Orale pues! Pues, don't take the pinche play so seriously. Jesus! Es puro vacilon, ese. Guacha. You want me to go? Pues, orale. But not before you check out what's happening back home today. The Navy has landed on leave with full pay, and war is breaking out... On the streets of L.A. ♫♫ ♫♫ Come on. Out! And stay out! Yeah. I told you. Get your hands off of me! Mmm, I'm feeling suave tonight. Let's dance. Mmm. Let's get out of here. Man #2 fine-looking chick, baby. Ow! Hey! Hey, watch it! Burrito! ♫♫ - Orale! That's enough! - ♫♫ Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. North and South America and all the ships at sea. Let's go to press. "Flash. Los Angeles, California, June 3, 1943." Serious rioting broke out here tonight, as flying squadrons of marines and soldiers... Joined the Navy in a new assault on the zooter—infested districts. A fleet of 20 taxicabs, carrying some 200 servicemen, pulled out of the naval armory at Chavez ravine tonight... And assembled a task force that invaded the eastside barrlos. The zoot-suiters, those gamin dandies"... Why don't you tell them what I really am, ese, or how you've been forbidden to use the very word? We're complying in the interest of the war. How are you complying? We're using other terms. Like "pachuco" and "zoot-suiter"? What's wrong with that? The zoot suit crime wave... Is even beginning to push the war news off the front page. The press has distorted the very meaning of the word "zoot suit." All it is for you guys is another way to say "Mexican"... Without insulting your ally south of the border. But the idea of the original chucois to look like a diamond... To look sharp, hip, bonaroo. Finding a style of urban survival... In the rural skirts and outskirts of the brown Metropolis of los, cabron. Come on! It's an affront to good taste! Like the Mexican, the Filipino and the black who wear it? It looks just as ridiculous on the white kids. You mean the WOPs and the Jews? Hey, look, sport. Be honest. You guys weren't even wearing clothes... When the white man pulled you out of the jungle. If a uniform is what you want, join the goddamn Army. Why? Because there's a war going on. What the hell are you trying to prove? You're no better than anybody else in the states. We've got shortages! Patriotic citizens are going without collars and cuffs... So you can wear those zoot suits. So? So what are we fighting for, if not to annihilate the enemies of the American way of life? Perdon, senior. Is that supposed to be us? There's that spic. Come on! Let's get him! Let's go! Yeah, sucker! Come on! We got you now! Come on. That's it. Asshole! I said, "is that supposed to be us?" Say it. Go on. Say it! Kill the pachuco bastard! ♫♫ Come on, zooter. Think you're more important than the war, zooter? Let's see if you got any balls in those funny pants, boy. Say, fellas. Maybe we shouldn't be doing this. Are you nuts? What'd he do to us? He's a draft dodger. Watch out for the knife. That's it, baby. Come on. Look out! Come on. Come on, boy. All right. Come on! Son of a bitch. Caged like an animal. A monkey in a monkey suit. Come on. Let's tear it off his back! Come on, man. He dropped his shiv! Get him! - Come on, you bastard. Come on! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Come on. That's... That's it. Fight, sucker! Come on. Come on! Enough! Whoo! They ganged up on me, carnal. You left me, and they ganged up on me. Why? Why didn't you take me with you? I was at the Sleepy Lagoon. I was there throwing chingazoslike everybody else. I went to the pinche dance with Bertha. I was wearing your zoot suit. All chingonin your tacuche. They stripped me. They stripped me, carnal. Hijo, they stripped me. They told me you did 90 days in solitary. You okay? Simon. When did you get out? Oh, a while ago. I got four months off for good behavior. It's good to see you. I was afraid things had changed. So much has happened. I heard you're living with my jefitos. Yeah. When I got out of ventura, my parents gave me a choice: Forget about you or get out, so... Alice says you guys will be out soon. Oh, yeah? Yeah. George is ready with the appeal brief. Oh, Hank, it's almost over. Then what? I'll be an ex-con. What do you think I am? Look, Hank, I'm not trying to push you into anything. If you still want me, Orale, suave! But if you don't, that's okay too. But I'm not gonna hang around like a pendeja all my life. I got nothing to give you, Della. Just give me some hope. How? Ask me to wait. What if we lose the appeal? We won't. I've screwed up your life enough already. You did eight months for me. Isn't that enough? I would die for you. I love you. Pero me chingan la madre if I'm gonna throw away my life for nothing. Della. Wait. No touching. What the hell. Go ahead. I love you. Oh. I love you. ♫♫ ♫♫ ♫♫ If the late summer of 1942 was the low point, two years later, the war for the allies is pounding its way toward certain victory. On the home front, Americans go on with their daily lives... With growing confidence and relief... As the war pushes on to inevitable triumph. Los Angeles daily press, Wednesday, November 8, 1944. Headline: "District court of appeals decides in Sleepy Lagoon murder case." Boys in San Quentin given"... Freedom! Orale. Good to see you, ese. I thought I lost you. It take more than the U.S. Navy to wipe me out, ese. Welcome back. It's good to be home. No hard feelings, Hank? Chale. We won, didn't we? Simon, ese. And that's a perfect way to end this play. Happy ending y todo. Ah! But life ain't that way, Hank. Henry Reyna went back to prison in 1947... For robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. While incarcerated, he killed another inmate... And wasn't released until 1955, when he got into hard drugs. He died of the trauma of his life in 1972.
