I know smoking this blunt is the last thing I need right now, especially after what happened yesterday. Shit. Every inch of my body feel like I got ran over by a fuckin' truck. I'm so lucky to be alive right now. But instead of praising God for still breathing, the only thing on my mind is the hatred and rage that's burning through my heart right now. Truth be told, none of this would have happened had I not left myself vulnerable. But I love to fuck, like a drug addict fiendin' for the high. If it gets me off, I'm down for whatever with whomever. I was betrayed by people who I thought I could trust to have my back. Man, hindsight is 20/20, ain't it? Note to self Chole Addison, never let your guard down again. Dear diary. My name is Chloe Addison and I am 13 years old. I live in Dallas, Texas with my mother, Queen. We're still going to the movies this weekend, aren't we, Daddy? Of course we are, sweetheart. I told you that, didn't I? You've made promises before and something always comes up. Welp, looks like we're here. Come on, Daddy, do I really have to go? I'd rather spend the day with you. Aw. Sweetheart, we talked about this before. Now Daddy got errands to run and business to handle. But I promise when I pick you up this evening, we can go to the mall. For real? For real, sweetheart. Can I get that new Coach purse I've been wantin'? Of course you can, baby. - Daddy, you the best. - I know that. And I won't tell Mama you been talking to Miss- - Hey, hey. Keep that on the low. That's us. Give 'em hell, baby, okay? Do it the Addison way. All right. Give it here, pow, Addisons. Good morning, Mr. Addison and good morning, Chloe. You look so pretty today in your dress. Thank you. Now you should be very proud of your daughter. Oh, I am. She is by far the most gift reader in the group. So, Chloe, I have a book for you. It's my favorite, you're gonna love it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I can't wait to read it. Daddy, I think I see Rihanna. Ooh. Hey, Ri. Love you, too, baby. Bye, Daddy. Hey. What's going on with you? I'm so happy to see you, I missed you so much. Oh, my gosh, I missed you, too. Are you feeling better? Ah, much better. I'm so glad to be back. Staying at my grandma's house was so boring. I thought you liked it over there? Sometimes, but she's not as much fun as your grandmother. And she can't cook, so. I heard that. Uh, why is Miss Nina is feeling on your dad like that? I don't know. She acts like that every time she's around him. Doesn't she know he's married? Yeah, but she don't know my mama's crazy. Obviously. I seen Queen cuss women out and beat a few of them up for looking at my daddy like that. Yep. Rihanna, come on, are you still gonna sit with us? Yes, here we come. Fuck we, no thanks. I don't wanna sit with the lower class. Chloe, what you said earlier about lower class and Kelly, that was rude. Whatever. I was just being honest. Mm-hmm, I was just being honest. Yeah, okay. Well, you know, your boyfriend Cedric is in here. Cedric Henderson is not my boyfriend. Mm-hmm, then why do you talk about him like all the time then, huh? Cedric is just eye candy. You wanna know the real reason why I called Kelly lower class? It's because she's been treating me differently lately since you've been gone. Why, did you do something to make her mad at you? No, she's just been acting weird and treating me different lately. I think I might know why, but you have to promise not to tell anyone what I'm about to tell you. Not Miss Nina or your mama, nobody Chloe. Rihanna, I won't, just tell me. Before I got sick, Kelly told me that she hates where she lives. Her house is always dirty and she always sees roaches crawling all over the place all the time. Ew, gross, that's disgusting. And most of the time she just goes to bed hungry because, I mean, her mom can't afford to buy then a lot of food. Dang, that's why she's been eating the way she has lately. She's been sneaking extra snacks and sandwiches in her backpack, too. Mm-hmm, haven't you ever noticed how dirty she looks and how she dresses sometimes? Yeah, every day. Well, that's because, you know. Hey, Chloe. Tell Q'Wan I said what's up and I'm gonna see him later. Okay, I will. Hi, Cedric. What's up, Rihanna? Y'all be easy. You, too. Later. He's gonna be my man. Girl, I thought you just said. I know. Okay. Well, he is fine, but, ugh, gross, he's your brother's friend, so he's like family. Guess we 'bout to be kissin' cousins, then. Girl, you nasty. Rihanna and Chloe, come on. Come work out with us. My mama is a real boss and her friend Pizazz watches her back all the time. I think they do crime stuff together. Queen. Pizazz. I thought I saw your car parked out front. Culture Nail Bar, this place is nice. What did you expect for the Queen? Hey, Cedric, how you doin', sweetie? I'm good Miss Queen. So, do you have a girlfriend? Really, Queen? Hey, I'm just trying to get to know the boy. Well, do you? I'm just datin' right now. I ain't takin' nothin' serious. Well, good. So you had any pussy yet? I take that as a no. It's good, stay woke. Little ratchet ass girls don't care nothing about a man's character these days. All they care about is your dollars and your dick. Why you gotta antagonize the kid, Queen? So you know how I do it. So, you get confirmation? Yeah, about an hour ago. Okay. Yellow shirt, white jeans. Hmm, what's her name? Ava. What kind of whip is she driving? It's a silver BMW convertible. It's parked out back. Mm-hmm. So, Ced, are you sure you're ready to join the royal court? For sure, I'm with it. Well, see how well you can guard the Queen. A little incentive. Peace. Oklahoma, move it. Hey, girl. Hey. I thought that was you. Ava, right? I'm sorry, have we met before? No, but by the time I'm done with you, you'll wish we hadn't. Get her. You crazy bitch. I think you got me mistaken for somebody else. No, no, no, no. You're the skank that's fuckin' Elijah Parker. See, I had no problem with him sellin' his shit down in Houston, but when he decided to grow a pair of balls and move up on my territory, that's some disrespectful shit and that got to be dealt with. What did you do? Did you hurt him? Did you know this motherfucker had the audacity to tell this crew to come up and shoot up my carwash, the one that I owned last week. I don't know nothin' about any of that shit. You don't now nothin' about this shit? No, I don't. Damn, too bad Elijah didn't live long enough to regret it, though. My God. Mm-hmm. Did you kill him? I mean, if Eli did what you think he did, then you already have the one who's responsible. Why the fuck did you come for me? Because their blood is on your hands, too, bitch. You helped set them motherfuckers up. And if you deny that shit, I promise I'll blow your shit up. Okay, okay. He threatened to kill my four-year-old son if I didn't agree to help him. I swear. Man, shoot that bitch. No, sir, no, please, please, please tell me, just tell me what I can do to make this right. Give me your keys. Give me your motherfuckin' keys. I want you to take Elijah's body, put it in this bitch's trunk. Oh, my goodness. Drop it down the Delvon Salvage and crush the motherfucker's body on the inside. What do we do with this bitch? I'm begging you please, please, please don't kill me. You wasn't doin' all that shit when you was settin' folks up. We know that your son needs you. I want you to take Pinky and slice her face and throw her in the trash like she is. Oh, bum bitch. I'm gonna love this. No, don't do it. Oklahoma, bring me my shoes. Mel. What's up, Queen? Your client had a family emergency, had to leave out back. Really? I just did her toes and her nails and she did not pay me. I'm sure this will be enough. You need a Brazilian wax, an eyebrow wax? That's what I thought. No, I'm good, Mel, thank you. Be safe, girl. Will do. Oklahoma. Are you still pissed that Chloe's not going to Zoe's place for the weekend? Her ass bailing out on me, D.A., was bullshit and you know it. Expecting her to miss her sister's bridal shower, that's ridiculous, Queen. She's the maid of honor, baby. But I agreed to pay that bitch $500. And, blood is always thicker than water, baby. Blood is thicker than my ass. You know what? I can't believe that bitch. I'm a fuck her up. Girl, put this shit in your mouth and chill the fuck out. I don't want that shit, D.A. You sure that's the only thing that you want in my mouth? Our guests will be here shortly, so don't tempt me. Besides, Chloe can just stay in her room all night. I mean, it'll be simple for her because all she'll do is have that phone stuck to her face like a damn zombie. But I think you just said that we still got time for you to be in my mouth. Woman. Let's get out here and get down to business. We got all night for that. Yeah. You go ahead, I'll be down. With your fine ass. My mama and daddy have a lot of parties at our house. And then the ladies give my mama money. The Queen has arrived. Yes, she has. And thanks to our girl, Venus, you all will be partying with some very elite pockets tonight. I'm talking about investors, engineers, surgeons, those who come from wealth. And regardless of their pedigree, when their horny asses come up in here, their stature means nothing between these four walls. Absolutely. They all pay to play. In cash, up front, no exceptions. I don't care if the want the real deal or the strap on. I don't give a fuck who's about giving or receiving. Anal costs more, understood? I expect to see a freaky, triple X rated show tonight. Give them something they don't get at home. And just don't want their body parts to be blown away. I want their fuckin' minds to be blown away. So whatever you guys need, D.A. has all that shit on sale. He has the cush, the pills, the lines to blow. And the more money they spend. Mm-hmm. The bigger your cut. Unless you motherfuckers got a death wish, don't even think about negotiating no side deals. Are we clear? Queen and I have always protected you and paid you extremely well. Never, never take that for granted by messing with our paper. 'Cause it's gonna be a very profitable night. Mm. One love. It's show time. Mm. Hmm. I need to talk with you and bring the skank with you. So anybody wanna tell me why the fuck you all are flirtin' with each other all night? What? Man, that shit you been smokin' got your head fucked up. Now, look. I don't know what you thought you saw, but you know that's a line that I would never cross. A room full of rich men downstairs and you have the nerve to be crushin' on my dude? Okay, Queen, it was all an act. All an act? Yes. But your body language said something different. So you know what? You think D.A.'s sexy, don't you? I'm a let you have him. Suck his dick. Hell, no. I said, suck his dick. You know what? Yo ass is trippin'. Am I? Suck his dick. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. He better not feel no teeth. Tonight, Cedric was at our house and I tried to do to him like I see the ladies do. The fuck? Holy girl, what are you doin'? I come here to see if you needed help with that. Damn. You're big. I wanna lick it. Girl, if you don't get your fast ass outta here, I will tell your mother. I just want- - Now. Come on, man. Hey, let me see. Get your ass outta here. Damn girl gonna get me killed. Get your ass over here. Come on, please, don't make me do this. Man, that was intense. Girl, you are good. Baby. Mm? She need to come work for us. You need to come work for me. You can make more money in one week than you can make in a whole month. You know what? Just 'cause you disrespected me, I ain't one of your hos. So, fuck you and your job. I got a job. No, fuck you. Okay, okay, okay, I'll do it. I'll do it. No, no, no, keep that same energy. - Queen, come on. - Pizazz! You know I have a daughter, okay. Queen, please don't do this. Take this trash out. Please, please, don't do this to me, come on. And one day, I'm gonna be just like Queen. I'm gonna be a boss. Damn it. Does he have to be so punctual? Shit. Fuck. I'm comin'. Damn. This room ain't that big for you to be taking that long, like what were you do- let me guess. You got your stuff? Of course. Hey, Chloe. Here you go. Ooh, yes. I told y'all the sports banquet would be an ideal huntin' ground, didn't I? As usual, you were right, but that? Ain't just from the athletes. Y'all slept with the coaches? Girl, scouts, professors and boosters, too, I think. Hey Q'Wan. You're looking sexy as usual. As are you. Don't take it personal, big bro, but if you want some of that, you got to pay like everybody else. Come on, little sis, you gonna do me like that? Trust me, it's worth the price of admission. I don't doubt that. Chloe, I can't thank you enough. I've been able to help my mother pay for her medical bills and cover what my financial aid didn't. And even when my daddy died, girl, I really thought I was gonna be done with school. I'll never forget what you did for me. We gonna miss you, boo. Oh, you, too. We love you Chloe Addison. Take care of yourself. I'm a miss you girls, too, take care. Look at you, Queen's comb. I guess the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. It was too easy, big bro. I will be affordably leavin' the money on the table for the next person to get. And I was tired of asking Queen for money, having to justify why I needed it. So, I took matters into my own hands. Took matters into your own hands, huh? You sound just like her. I just hope that you was smart enough to start stinkin' your paper instead of spending it on stupid shit like purses and clothes, hmm. You got a lot to learn. Come on, junior, let's get your things. Dear diary. Don't touch me. I'm leaving Atlanta and going back to Dallas officially a college graduate. I've had my fun these past four years, but parents have let my family know that I'm ready to be in the family business. All right, I will get your things and I will take them to your apartment while you get your hair done. My apartment? Yes, ma'am. It's one of your graduation presents from Queen. Shut up. Rent paid for the entire year. Get out. She wanted to give you the keys herself but, you know, her and pops had to make a run. Bruh, anyways, when you get through just call me and I'll come pick you up. That's okay, bro, Ri's gonna drop me off. Okay, cool, cool. Well, um, I will text you the address and, uh, I'll pick you up for dinner at eight. Wait? You're picking me up for dinner? Are you sick, bro. Oh, my God, are you dying? Girl, stop. Let me know, 'cause I been gone. You just be ready. I stay ready. Thank you. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh, Chloe, you look so good. You look so good. Oh, my gosh, you have no idea how much I've missed you. Not as much as I missed you, oh, my gosh. And this place, it's really nice. Thank you. Girl, I'm so proud of you. Girl, I'm thinking about putting a bar over here and then I'm also thinking about maybe having some live jazz music to, you know, make the experience better. Now that's how you boss up. Period. But, you know, I can't take all the credit. You know, your mom helped me out a lot. Girl, you know she loves you. And I love me some Queen. Taking me in all those years ago after my mom died. Girl, you know you're family. But there's one thing I know is that you need to fix this hair, girl, come on, let's go. Yes, please. So when was the last time you talked to Kelly? A few days ago. How is she doing? She just got a summer internship in the district attorney's office. But wait a minute. Why are you asking me how she's doing? You could call and ask her yourself. No, I can't. And why not? You know why. Chloe, that was six years ago. Kelly ain't trippin' over the bullshit no more. Ever since she found out about her mom and the things she was doing, our relationship has never been the same. But I was the one that accidentally let the cat out the bag and she forgave me. Exactly. But she's always been closer to you, Ri. Uh, no, because I talked to her and apologized. But, believe it or not, Chloe, she has forgiven you, too, okay? A bond like ours might bend, but it never breaks. Then how come every time I return home, she never return any of my phone calls or try to make time to see me? She's a full-time law student, Chloe. I hardly have time for a social anymore if it makes you feel better. We be doing too much. Have you talked to Cedric lately? It's been a minute. Why do you ask? Oh, so you haven't heard? Yes. Haven't heard what? That he has a girlfriend. He has a what? Mm-hmm. She comes here to get her hair and makeup done all the time. To a beauty salon that my best friend owns? Uh, do not go there. You wouldn't dare cut off your nose just to spite your face, so why would you expect me to? You right. But I still wouldn't think that my best friend- - Okay, out of respect for you, I've never taken her on as a client of mine. Even though she has requested me three times, but she's never late, she's referred tons of people and she tips extremely well. You know what? I don't even know why I'm trippin'. I don't know either. You literally just had the time of your life in college. Girl, I did. And Cedric Henderson was just another page in my playbook. You sure that's all he was to you? There was a time when I wanted more. Hell, I offered him this pocketbook so many times, I lost count. He just never took it. I'm not sure if he's just not interested in me or if he's afraid of my family. But I don't know why, my family loves him. Yeah, as a worker, not as someone sleeping with the family princess. Girl, Cedric ain't crazy, he enjoys living, but I don't blame you for being salty, so. Look, I'm tired of talking about his sorry ass. Okay, then let's take a trip down to Pettyville and talk about his new bitch instead, okay, girl. Last week she came through here looking crazy as hell, okay? What does she look like anyways, 'cause I know she don't look better than me. Ratchet as hell, girl, she could never. You know what? I'll go give Cedric my pocketbook if y'all don't hurry up. Okay, I'm a need you not to talk to me like this. Who is this? Tonight my family threw me a surprise graduation party, which they really could have kept, because most of those folks look like their drug customers, except for my family and friends, of course. Congratulations. Thank you. It's so great to see all of you. Thank you. Hi, Mama. Hi, baby, I'm so proud of you being the first Addison to graduate from college. Thank you. Move, Mama. Granny! Welcome home, baby girl. I'm so proud of you. Thank you, I missed you. I missed you, too. Daddy's little princess. I'm so proud of you, sweetheart. Thank you, Dad. You got me good, bro. I can't believe you kept all this a secret. Shit, Queen threatened to kick my butt if I would have told you. I sure did. He did a great job keeping the secret, too. All right. - Man. - What's up, man? I thought I told you to be here at 8 p.m. so you could at least say congratulations with the family. Bro, I was waitin' on Big P. His ass was late, so I couldn't make it. Enough of all that mushy stuff. Congratulations, Sis. I see something over there that's lookin' mighty delightful. I'm a have to catch you later. Catch you later, bro. Baby girl. Hi, Uncle Trent. Hey, look at ya, looking all good and grown and shit. Lookin' just like your mama. I'm glad you don't look like your funny ass lookin' daddy over here. Hey, man, hey, hey. My beautiful baby looks exactly like me. What are you talking about? Yeah, whatever. Uh, Chloe, I got something for you. Congratulations. Thank you, Uncle Trent. Hell, yeah, I think you gonna like that. Hey, girl. Ri! Why you didn't tell me about this? Hey, Chloe. It's good to see you. Hi, Kelly, good to see you, too. Congratulations. Thanks, you, too, with law school and everything. I love this. The triple threat back together again. Okay, ladies, let's celebrate. Chloe. Hey. Congratulations, baby, I'm so proud of you. Thank you, Tania. You're welcome. Who is he? Oh, this is my new boo. I'm Tony. Hi, I'm Chloe. We got you something for your, uh, graduation. Thank you. Wow, you really shouldn't have. Uh, no, he shouldn't have. Um, they've got money and we've got bills. Here you go, baby. Thanks, Tania. You're welcome. He better not have brought that bitch with him. So I assume you made the drop? Yeah. 16 keys. 16 keys, huh? Yeah. 16 keys? Yeah. So we straight, we good? You tell me, we straight? Good? Yeah. Of course. Look, there's some honeys here tonight and I see somebody I feel like entertaining, is that all right? Hey, man, enjoy yourself. Do you, be free while you can. All right. We straight? We straight. Straight. Oh, shit. Yes, sir. A whole bag of this. Yes, sir. Ooh, goddamn. That's some shit. Queen, hello, man, what you doing in here? What is you doing? Hey, hey, hey, you flushin' my money down the toilet. What is wrong with you? Why are you disrespecting your daughter's party like this? Did you not know my mother's in there? And did you forget that you have a meeting with Big P tonight? Listen, I know about the meeting and I haven't forgot. I got this queen. The hell you do. One highlight was that Cedric was there looking fine as hell. Hey, Cedric. Hey, what's good shawty? Thank you for coming to my graduation party. Yeah, no doubt. I'm glad you did your thing and got your degree. So what you plan on doing now that you graduated? Some type of office job or what? I don't know. I haven't figured it out. You see, these little binges of yours is causing my credibility to be undermined in these streets. Listen, anything I do in private is never undermining your credibility, sweetheart. You know what? You lost your edge. Yeah. You're becoming more of a liability for me. And you know that's a price that neither one of us can afford, so guess what? I am going to handle the business tonight with Big P. - But Queen. - But nothing. Now what you can do is clean this shit up and go in there enjoy your daughter's party 'cause I'm not gonna let you or anybody else fuck that up and if you do, nigga, I will blow your shit back. You ain't gotta be like that, baby. Trippin', man. Always trippin', man. Fuck! Shit. Do look clean, though. This is fun, back in there, shit. You look really nice tonight. Wanna dance? Uh, no, I'm good, congrats, though. Hey, Tony. Hey, Chloe. How are you? I'm doing fine, how are you? I'm well. Wait, what are you doing, Chloe? You look so good tonight. - I just wanted to- - What are you doing? Personally thank you for coming to my graduation party. Hey, Ri. My Aunt Eve showed up and as usual there was drama. Baby sister. Eve, what are you doing here? I came to congratulate my niece and give her a gift. Yeah, okay. Yes, but, you know, I'm so glad that you came. I'm glad, too. But you should have told me you were coming. What are you doing here? Mama, I told Eve about the party. Need I remind you that I am the matriarch of this family? Mama, we know that you're the matriarch of this family. But holding a grudge against Eve, dishonors Ray's memory. This stubborn old witch ain't gonna forgive nobody. She can't even forgive her damn self. Aunt Eve! Hey, girl. Congratulations. I'm so happy to see you. Look at you. I'm so proud of you. I got you a little something. It's not much, but I hope you like it. Oh, I'm sure I'll love it. Thank you. You look so good. Thank you. How much dick you have to suck to buy this? - Oh, hell, nah, look. - Mama! Thanks for the invite, sis. But I ain't gotta deal with this bullshit. And you can't kiss my ass. Bitch. Ugh, Mama! Mama, why would you do that? Get out! What's going on? Get out now. You're not gonna stop her? You know what? Chloe, this is none of your concern. Go enjoy your party. Go! Nothing is ever my concern. Mama, you were wrong for that and you know it. How dare you try to tell me what's right and wrong. She know what she did. I should have never named her after my grandmother. She doesn't deserve it. Get outta my way. Don't worry about it, baby. Get away from me with all that affection shit. Woman. What you need to be trying to do is trying to handle the business with Big P tonight. I gotta make sure my sister get back to the halfway house. We left my geriatric graduation party and ended up at the hangout spot and wouldn't you know it would be just as much drama there. Chloe, your grandmother slapped the shit out of Eve. I don't blame Granny, Eve was wrong for that. Look, y'all know Granny don't play. They didn't have to mess up my graduation party, though. Girl, your graduation party is not messed up. That's why we're here. Y'all see those fine twins over there? Girl, first the guys from the party and now them? I need you to get your clit in check. Stop looking at them. I can't help it. Then go talk to them. Go talk to who? No one. I have somebody else on my mind. Chloe, you're still after Cedric after all these years? Girl, he don't want you, let it go. Like how you need to let go of that stick in your butt? You can kiss my ass, Chloe. That's exactly what you need, a brother to kiss yo ass, spank yo ass, lick yo ass while he stick it in that ass. Whatever, you can both kiss my ass. I'm focused on my studies. Besides, I have my battery operated boyfriend to handle that. Girl, a vibrator cannot replace the touch and feel of a man. I need you to loosen up and let love slide in. Love or 10 inches? Let's go dance, y'all. Hey, watch where you're going. Or what, skank? What you gonna do about it? Bitch, don't be comin' at my friend like that, like you really about shit. Oh, girl, please, go through puberty before you come for me. Oh, it ain't nothing but space and opportunity, bitch. Rihanna don't entertain this ignorance. Bitch don't be comin' at me. Girls, stop. After the fight and Cedric blowing me off, I had to relieve my tension the best way I know how. Wake up. Dude, seriously? You need to wake up like now, shit. Fuck. What took you so long to open the door? It look like she's drunk. I'm not drunk, but I just went to sleep two hours ago. So you didn't think I was gonna get that call last night about that fight? Those bitches started it. I don't give a damn who started it. All I wanna know is did you whoop that ass? Granny, you know I did. What the fuck? Good morning, ladies. I need to get to work. But can I call you later, Chastity? Chastity? Chloe. What the hell kinda shit is this? I mean, they don't even know each other's name. What kind of young people shit is this? Boy, if you don't get your ass outta here. Chloe, come and sit your ass down. We come over here to talk to you about the next stage in your life and sitting over here doing stupid shit like this? Strange men in your bed? I'm sorry, Mama. Do you not realize who you are? You are an Addison. Your pussy is premium brand, baby, and you lettin' some random knockoff nigga dick you down. I taught you better than that. She was just gettin' a little piece. Ain't nothing wrong with getting a little piece. I mean, she did just graduate from college. It's just the quality of man that I don't like. Look, Chloe, now that you've graduated from college, it's time for you to join the family business. Are you serious? We were. But not if you gonna be doing stupid shit like we just saw. It won't happen again, Grandma. Chloe. Your great-great-grandmother Eve created a lineage of strong women and started this business that held us down for years. Now it's time for you to learn this business so that you can continue the legacy. You have to be hard. A heart of steel. Ain't not time for that sentimental bullshit. If a man or woman needs to be taken down, you order the hit and you make sure that the execution is done. Your personal business stays your personal business. This apartment is your sanctuary. No one should know where you lay your head at night. We don't have time for any more slipups. None. Our money and our lives will be in your hands. I got it. She got it. She got it. I been wanting to be in the family business for a long time, Queen. Chloe, this is nothing like that little prostitution ring you had in college. What? You didn't think I know? I know everything. So, don't try me. This is a grown woman's business. Yes, ma'am. Mama, you think she ready? Mm, mm. Go get dressed. We got somewhere to go. Today, Queen gave me my second graduation present and this one puts me right in the middle of the family business. Finally. Mom. What are we doing here? Excuse me? What is my name? Queen. Queen. From now on, that's how you will address me. I'm the queen, you're the subject, got it? Got it. What we're actually doing here, this is a part of your graduation gift. This is just not a mechanic shop, Chloe, this is one of our spots. And school is about to be in session, ready? Good morning, Queen. What's up, Chloe? What up, bro? You ready? You ready? Yes, I'm ready. I wish y'all would stop asking me that. I'm ready. My bad. We gonna see. Damn right. This is your best friend. You learn her. You study her. You always keep one in the chamber and ready. Q'Wan will take you out back and teach you how to shoot. Ced about to come in here. Wipe that shit off your face. Morning, Queen. Ced. I got the van ready for delivery. I just can't find D.A. Nah, he ain't here. I'll hit up Big P so he can go with you. No. You go with him. Okay. We'll be here until you get back. Say no more. Let's go. He's loyal. He's dependable. He's never give me a reason to question my trust of him. But I will put him in a body bag. Please don't make me lose one of my best workers behind your damn vagina. Are we clear? Yes, ma'am. Good. Come on, let me show you the rest of the place. Here's this place, here, here. Mm, mm, mm. Good morning, baby, did I wake you? Nah, you didn't wake me. Just making you your favorite. You're my favorite. Really? But you look good. Thank you, baby. Have I told you how happy you make me? Hmm, just a hundred times, but tell me again. You make me happy. So if I make you so happy, then why aren't you in my bed every night? Come on now, you know the answer to that. And hurry up with that plate, please. I'm kinda hungry. So, are we still going to the mall? You promised. We went to the mall yesterday, sweetie. But, yes, to answer your question, yes, we'll go to the mall. So, speaking of making you happy. Hmm? You know why I make you happy? Because I'm a lady, because I'm feminine and because I know how to cater to my man, unlike that pit bull in a skirt, who's running around here looking like a man. Watch your mouth, Nina. Oh, come on, D.A. You promised. Chloe's graduated from college and there's no reason why you're not here with me now. I mean, why are you paying for all this if you're not gonna be here? Look, me staying here will never happen. I mean, you knew that when you opened your legs up to me the first time. But, but, D.A. But D.A. nothing. That pit bull in a skirt, she's the reason why you're living the way you're living. That pit bull in a skirt, she's the reason why you're driving the cars you're driving. That pit bull in the skirt, she's the reason why you got fancy purses on your arm and going to the malls every day. D.A., it's not fair. You said, you promised. Mm. Why you gettin' mad? I'm just so tired of this. How long have we been doin' this now? Sweetheart, don't, come here, baby. No, don't baby me. Come here, I was just playin'. Don't come over here touchin' on me, D.A., I am not playin' with you. Let me tell you somethin' baby. No, D.A., no. Girl, let me tell you something. What? Baby, you know I love you- - Baby. - Don't you? Yeah, you say you love me. I really mean it. I love you, baby. I love you, too. I love you a lot. Oh. Mm. I love you a lot. I love you, too. Close the door. So you in here being greedy? What? You heard me. You in here being greedy? No, Queen, Queen, I was- - Shut the fuck up. Look at this bitch nostrils and tell me what you see. - I see powder on her nose. - What? You see powder on her nose? No, Queen, no. It was an accident. I would never do that shit to you. You would never do that shit to me? Listen. You know what, you need to handle your worker. Queen, I been knowing you too long- - Shut the fuck up. Get your ass over here and handle your worker. Queen, Queen, listen, this is all a big misunderstanding. Queen, all this shit is not necessary, Queen. There's no need for that. Ow! You better toughen your soft ass up and I mean right the hell now. So you wanna do my shit, huh? You sitting up here fuckin' with my powder and it's an accident? Queen. But, no, Queen, come on, please. Watch this shit. Queen, Queen. Is that what you wanna do, huh? Queen, you are overreacting. You want this? When I, no, Queen, please. Yeah, let's have some, huh. Queen, no, Queen, come on, please. I would never do. Queen wanted me to stop my worker and I just couldn't do it. What does she expect? It was just my first day, but I'm gonna be ready next time for sure. Okay, Chloe, you play too much. Y'all know I'm a damn fool. Now this is living. I plan to live like this one day. Right? I love the view of the city from here. It's breathtaking. If I stay focused and open a second shop, I could live like this, too. You will, Ri. You've been grinding hard these last few years and it's gonna pay off. Y'all think Rihanna's the only one that's been working hard these last few years? What, y'all heifers think getting into law school was a walk in the park? Heifers? Of course not, Kelly. We know it's hard work going after that legal gavel and I tip my glass to you. Yeah, me, too. I was thinking, Chloe, since you're big ballin', shot callin', doing God knows what, maybe you can help a sister out and invest in my second salon? Your mom can vouch that I'm good for it. Maybe one day. But right now, I'm focused on my new endeavor. Endeavors? What endeavors do you have besides letting your mom and dad spoil you and pay your bills? Chloe, you don't have anything else to do but shop all day. You can take some time out of your schedule to learn about my business. No thank you, Rihanna. And I do more than shop all day. As much money as I'm getting paid, that's exactly what I could do if I wanted to. Rihanna, Chloe is just like Tania F. Martin, fly ass apartment, designer clothes. But she ain't got no job, man. I see y'all got jokes. What I'm doing takes more heart than either one of your soft asses. With your damn blow dryer and your legal briefs. You got that right? I'm running a stash house. A stash house? Where? Old mechanic shop on Washington. That's a stash house? Hmm, never knew. And you still don't. So keep your damn mouth quiet about it. Okay. So what do you do exactly? You know. Runnin' things. Making sure product goes out, money comes in and my employees are kept in line. Well, congratulations, Miss Chloe, I didn't know you were runnin' around doing all that. Runnin' a stash house is dangerous. Aren't you scared? Rihanna, this runs through my veins. I didn't ask to be a part of the game, the game chose me. I'm just playin' my position. Wow. So you're trying to become the next Queen instead of using your college degree? That is so dumb. You're smart enough to make money legally. Nah, Miss Legal Eagle, I was born for this. What up, Sam. Hey. What's going on Brady? Just the man I need to see. Sir. I need you to take this. For you. And that's for you. And that's for you. So how's everything going out there? Everything's straight. Yeah? Makin' it happen. Okay. Where the crew? I'm here solo. No crew. - All right. - Why, what's the problem? Look, word around town little shawty's saying she delivered a package for you. Hah! You know nobody around here pushes weight but the Queen. No, bruh, you not listening to me. She said she delivered a package for you about a year ago, a liability package. That certain person? She better shut the fuck up 'fore I choke the shit out her ass. Hey, y'all. Eve. What are you doing here? And who is this fed looking here? My new man, Gary. New man? I just met you yesterday. Bro, I'm out. Yeah, man, it's a lot going on in here. Be easy in the streets. So, brother-in-law, we just in the neighborhood, thought we'd say hi. Now know I don't believe that shit. All right, look, let me hold a little something. Man, if you don't get outta here with that bullshit. And how'd you get out the halfway house anyway? Whoa, halfway house? Wait a minute. Wait a minute, you an addict? Uh-uh, see, I don't do crackheads. I'm out. - Come on, baby, don't- - Uh-uh. Come on, D.A. Let me hold a little something. You know what? I'm a let you hold something all right. I'm taking your ass straight to Queen. No. Let's go. Dear diary. I'm enjoying my new normal. Running the stash house with my brother, learning how to shoot my piece, and seeing Cedric's sexy ass. Cedric still ain't givin' me no play, but Queen taught me to be patient. This is a marathon, not a sprint. I got this. It's about to heat up in here some more. 'Cause that right there my friends is game. Aha, gimme my money. Man, yo ass cheatin', man. Q'Wan stay winning. Damn, Cedric, why do you always look so sexy every time I see you. Chloe, I'm tired of telling you about these little antics. I don't want you little girl. Cedric, why you still trying to play so hard to get? It's obvious that I'm not a little girl anymore. Hey, yo, Ced. I need you to make a run with me. Cool, where we going? Queen need us to make a drop. D.A. ain't answering the phone and I think she got Big P with her. Baby sis. I got a customer coming to pick up a package, he will ask for me and say we went to high school together. Got it. Think you can handle things around here by yourself? Yeah, I told you I got it. All right, we gonna see. Let's ride. Hey. What's up? How can I help you? Waitin' on Q'Wan. He's not here. How can I help you? You can't, ma'am, I'll just come back later. How do you know I can't help you? Who are you? Me and Q'Wan went back to high school. He said if I was ever on this side of town, I should stop by. Oh, yeah, that's right. Follow me. Ease your ass up outta there. Oh, man. And fix your clothes. All right, all right, whoa, whoa. And get on your knees. That go for you, too, lover. Hands up! Hands up, both of you! Now which one of you is in charge here? I am. And you two motherfuckers don't know who you're messin' with. So tell us, who are we dealin' with. The Addisons. And believe me, when my family finds out about this, you two motherfuckers will be dead. Nah, ma. See, I figure if you give me just a little taste of what you was givin' him, then I just might let you live. Come on, man, let's hurry up and get this shit over with, man. Well, mama, time for you to meet your maker. Oh, shit, whoa. Well, well, well. Look like got caught with your panties around your ankles, Miss Chloe. Mm-mm, yeah. Mama, I was trying to- - What did you just call me? Queen, Queen, I mean, Queen, I'm sorry. Yeah, you are sorry. Stand your ass up. Nigga, I didn't say nothin' about you moving. Boys, I got it from here. Q'Wan is outside with your money. That could have been the death for you. I told you that one day your pocketbook would you get you in trouble one day, didn't I? Didn't I? And you, I told you to come in here and buy product. I didn't tell you nothing about fuckin' my daughter. I hope you enjoyed it because that's gonna be the last pieces you get. Come on, Queen, no, I'm sorry. She, she, approached me, what else I was supposed to do? Say no, motherfucker. You know what. Hold, hold. - Shoot him. - No, no. Queen, come on, Queen, come on now. Shoot him now. Wait, come on now, please, please, please. I don't think that I can. What the fuck, what you stutterin' for. Give me this shit. You can't shoot him. Queen, come on now, whoa, whoa, okay. Please don't shoot me. I pissed on myself. You better be glad that you got a wife and a baby at home. Otherwise your ass would be dead. Now you get your pissy ass outta here. You better stop fuckin' playing with me, Chloe. Are we clear? Dear diary. I fucked up. Baby girl. Your mother dropped me off, said she's be right back. You mind if an old lady sit and chat with you for a little bit. You are not old and none of us see you as old. You got that right. And the reason you all don't see me as old is because I never show signs of weakness even when I feel weak. I smell food coming from my kitchen. Were you in there cooking? You know I was and you been sitting out here all of this time just pouting. You know, your grandfather is the main reason that I'm the woman that you see now. When he left me and his kids for another woman, he taught me a very valuable lesson. He must have really hurt you. Yes, he did. And from that day forward, I've never operated on emotions again. What do you mean by that? Chloe, your pocketbook can get you in a whole lot of trouble, more than it already has. What in the hell were you thinking the other day at the shop? I don't know. I feel awful. You should, damn it. You better be glad that this was a test and not the real thing. You better start thinking with brass and not your ass. You always get the money first. Fuck all that personal bullshit. And most important, you never let a man distract you from your business. I'm sorry. I slipped up and almost put us all at risk. Queen will not stand for any more slipups. Keep your emotions and your pocketbook at home before you get more than your ass whipped next time. Yes, ma'am. It's going to be time for you to take the throne soon. Get it together now. What the hell is she doing here? Mama, stop being like that, okay. Hi, hi, Mama. Mama, you remember the center had called and said that she would be released today. I remember, but I do not recall saying that she would be in my presence. Well, she's in your presence, 'cause she got something to say to you and you're gonna listen. Well, I'm listening. I just wanted to say that, I just wanna say that Mama, I love you and I don't want us to- - You could have put that shit in a damn text. See what I'm talkin' about. Wait, wait, wait, this gone all too long, y'all. What the hell happened between the two of you? She was there the night your brother was killed. You never told me that you were there. She witnessed the whole thing. You just stood there and watched those white bastards beat and mutilate your brother to death. I had no choice. Mama, what was I gonna do to three white men with shotguns and knives? You could have screamed or ran to get help. Did it ever occur to you that if I would have done that, they would have killed me, too? I lost a piece of my soul that night and it's all your fault. No. Actually, it's yours. What did you just say to me? You're responsible for his death, Mama. Mama, what is she talkin' about? Mama, what is she talkin' about? A few weeks after Ray was murdered, I overhead her on the phone telling somebody what she'd done. She came home from the grocery store one morning and found a letter from Daddy confessing about the affair he'd been having for months. Bastard packed his bags and left her with three kids to raise by herself. Yeah, you don't have any right to call Daddy that. Oh, she's called him worse. Especially when she found out who he left her for. Mama, I know your blood was boiling when you found out your black man liked a lot of cream in his coffee. So Daddy cheated on you with a white woman? Not just any white woman either. His boss' wife. Shut your damn mouth, Eve. Leave that shit in the past. No, Queen deserves the truth. She needs to know your vengeful ass is the reason our father and brother's dead. What did you do, Mama? She went to go see that hateful bigot, Mr. Hancock down at the steel mill where daddy worked. She told him his wife was cheating on him. Why would you do that? You know how people were way back then. Why would you do that, Mama? I heard her say his face filled with rage when she found out his wife was fuckin' a nigga. Days later, Daddy's body was found, multiple gunshot wounds to the chest and head. A few days after that Hancock's wife was found, naked and beaten to death in the woods. Mama. Mama. She lied to the cops that night when they questioned her just like she'd been lyin' to you all these years. Well, what does all of that got to do with Ray's death? What does that got to do with it? Hancock wanted our entire family to suffer. No one knows how he found out Ray was gay, but he paid the man to seduce him and lure him down to the tracks that night. After they beat him within an inch of his life, they slit his throat and castrated him. You told me that Ray's death was a stickup gone wrong. That's what you told me! She lied! You can hate me forever, Mama. Fuck. But I refuse to live with the pain and the guilt anymore. I've been so focused on my own pain, I just couldn't understand yours. I wasn't there when you needed me most, Eve, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry I blamed you. And I'm sorry for treating you so badly after all of these years, baby, please forgive me. It's about LeBron up in here, baby. Oh, man. Oh, my, man, what did you do? Perfect. Man, perfect? Man, this is not perfect. What are you talkin' about? What you talkin' about? Hey, man, you asked for this. Man, Texas taught you how to do this. Look, man, you come here with this Chris Brown hairdo, told me to tip the top, I tipped the top. Tip the top? Man, if you don't give me my hat. Hey, you just run me my money. Man, I'm fittin' to run up outta here, that's I'm fittin' to do. Yeah, just run my money. Don't forget to tip me. Hell, yeah. Bruh, bruh. Well, well, well. D, I've been workin' for you for five years. We're practically family, brother. Brother. Listen, don't pull that sentimental bullshit with me. You tampered with our product and you stole from us. Pizazz, shock the shit out this motherfucker. No, no. D.A. we better than- Trenton, Trenton, Trenton. You know, I'm surprised to see you in this predicament. You really disappointed me and that shit hurt me to my heart. Queen, you know I wouldn't steal from you. You tryna say Queen can't count, motherfucker? You think I can't count, nigga? Why y'all think I did it? Queen, you know. Because four kilos come up missin' while your ass was there. Four. Look, I wasn't the only one there last night. Who else was there? Huh? Who else was there? Queen, come on. That's what I thought. Look, maybe Eve did it. I saw her sneakin' around there the other day. Oh, shit, you done fucked up now. Stupid motherfucker. Nigga, what did you just say? Queen, wait, wait, wait, wait, Queen. Chloe. Okay, okay. You got your strap? Look, D.A., come on. Baby girl, you don't wanna do this don't, don't. Shoot this motherfucker. Don't, Queen, please. No, please, Queen. Queen, I was gonna shoot him. Yeah. I know. I'll let you know when I want blood on your hands. Besides, your ass was takin' too long. Come on, your Granny cooked us something to eat. Y'all clean this motherfucker up. Today we executed Trent. I thought I was ready to pull the trigger, but I hesitated and Queen didn't want me to be the one to do it. I have a feeling that the time is gettin' near and I better be ready. Hey, buddy. Buddy, what you doing? Get out of the basket. Yeah, you found the little gift I got you. D.A., come on, you know that boy doesn't need anymore toys. Man, he gets the best. He's the baby, he's my baby. Isn't that right, isn't that right? Okay, anyway, how was your day? Same old gangsta shit, that's all. Who was it today? It doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that I'm here with my baby and my other baby. I'm glad you're here, too, but you know what, let me put him down for his nap and I'll be right back. Tell Daddy bye-bye. Say, see you later. I'll be back. Boy's crazy. He's gettin' big, too. Okay, so. Where were we? Wherever you wanna be. You know it could be like this all the time, right? The only thing you have to do is just move in with me and the baby. I miss you. Come on, D.A. Why would I do that? Don't you know a man never leaves his wife for his side chick. I'm your side chick, D.A.? That's what you think about me? We have a son together. I am not your side chick. Don't act surprised now. You knew what you was gettin' into when you was fuckin' with me. Just 'cause we got that little brat back there doesn't change things. Brat? That brat in there is our son. You know what D.A.? You said you were gonna leave. You know what? I'm tired of dealing with this. Look, I told you not to bring this shit up again. And since you did, it's time for you to get a dose of reality. Now whatever you think about Queen, that's my Queen, you got it? Your Queen? What about me, D.A.? What about me and your son? What are we to you? Fuck y'all. No, you're not going anywhere. I'm not finished talking to you. D.A. We're not finished, you know what? Fuck you, D.A. This shit is bogus. Oh, God. I should have worn different shoes. My feet hurt. Rihanna, why are you up dancing anyway? No one's even here yet. Look, she's practicing because she's gonna need those moves to find suitable dick. All he needs to be is breathing and that's suitable enough for you. Worry about your own dry ass pocketbook, heifer. At least mine doesn't have cobwebs on it. Ladies! No cat fights tonight. Y'all need to stop this shit right now because I have had enough of it. Now I'm gonna go and get us some drinks and while I'm gone, you two squash this beef. Kelly, what have I done to you that was so horrible? You know. You're right. I shouldn't have taken those pictures of your mom that night. But I only took them to show you that she was there so that when I told you, you would believe me. But I wasn't the one that leaked them, I promise. Then how'd they get leaked then? The kids in school made fun of me for years after that. Chloe, you were supposed to be my friend. How could you do that to me? For the umpteenth time, it wasn't me. I let Rihanna borrow my phone to take pictures of her stupid boyfriend and he's the one that leaked them. Why are you mad at her? Rihanna genuinely apologized that she had nothing to do with it. You took the photos and I knew you wanted them to get out. You never let anyone use your phone. You did that shit on purpose. Kelly, I'm sorry. I really am. I was stupid and young and I didn't know how my actions would hurt you. Please. Forgive me. I forgive you. Good. So this means we can be true friends again? It means I'll tolerate you when you're around my friend, Rihanna. Tell Rihanna I'll call her tomorrow. Chloe, what did you say? I tried to apologize and she wasn't trying to hear it. So I'm done. Let me go talk to her. No, you're not leaving and I'm done talking about her. Let's enjoy our night out. Okay. But I am gonna talk to her while I'm staying at her place. Why are you staying at her place? My place is being fumigated. Speaking of, could I leave a couple of boxes over at your place so I don't have to buy storage? Sure, but fumigated. Ew, gross, you got the cooties. Girl, shut up. Look who just arrived. Go ahead, make a fool of yourself because if you can make a fool of yourself, then I can go and talk to Kelly. Are you gonna be okay by yourself? Girl, hell, yes. My man is here. Your man. Yeah, okay. Hater, bye. Is my family paying you to follow me? Girl, ain't nobody following you. I'm here enjoying myself or at least I was till you appeared in my face. Where's your fiance? In my bed. Damn. Why do you have to be so rude to me? 'Cause you're the type of woman that your mother warned me about. You only after two things. My money and my dick. Now what do you want? I just wanted to say hi. Why? Damn. You remember when we were younger and I got into a fight with, um, freckle face Tania? Now, I remember, freckle face Tania, yeah, I remember that. Man, she was like two feet taller than you, right? Shoot, I didn't care, she stole my cookies. Yeah, well, they must have been some good cookies, 'cause you stomped over her all bowed like you was gonna do something. Everybody knows fudge stripes are the best. Must be, I mean, shit, you got your ass beat over them cookies. Yeah, I did. But you came to my rescue. Yeah, well. I couldn't just sit back and let her do you like that. Aw, come on, girl. Let's go dance. Good morning, sleepyhead. Girl. Why do you have to be so loud? What's in the box? Just the hair products you said I could keep here while my place is being fumigated. Okay, just leave it over there. So, who did you end up going home with last night, 'cause I know you went home with somebody. Wait, is he still here? Girl, hush. Ain't nobody here but me. So, do you remember what I told you when we were 12? 12? I barely remember what you told me last week and you look like shit. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm good. I just had a long night. But to jog your memory, I told you that one day, one day I was gonna get me some Ceddy, Ced, Ced. Holy shit, what the, wait. When did you and Ced hook up? Girl, last night after the club. Are you serious? And y'all slept together? Yes, honey. I was sliding down his pole like a stripper dancin' for her rent money. Ah, well, it's about damn time. Give me all of the juicy details. How did it go down? Wait, don't tell me. He walked up to you and finally told you how much he's always wanted you? Girl, no. Well, what happened? Well, after you left, I saw him standing at the bar. I was flirtin' with him, as usual, you know me. What are you drinkin'? Aw, it's a whiskey sour. Ooh, I've always wanted to- - Come on, hey, Chloe, Chloe, stop, bruh. Chloe, come on now, give me my damn drink, man. Okay. While my back was turned to him, I slipped a little relaxation powder in his drink, What's relaxation powder? A roofie. So, then... Yo, Chloe, is that you? Shh. Yo, what's going on, like. So you drugged him? No, I helped him relax. Relax? Chloe, you put something in his drink without his permission. That's called drugging him. What the hell is the matter with you? First off, you need to watch who you're raising your voice at. I'm not Kelly. No, you're not Kelly, because Kelly's actually doing something positive with her life. I don't know what the hell's been going on with you lately. First, it was the mechanic shop and now this? Now this what? I'm taking control of my life. Oh, I get it. Your pathetic, sleazy, delusional ass took control by drugging Ced to get his dick. Miss oh, I can get any man that I want. Bitch! I can get any man that I want by any means necessary. Is that all you desire out of life? Dick after dick after dick? No substance, just one big dick party? This is my lineage. This is my heritage. The Addisons are bosses. I'm a boss and I get what I want. Yeah, y'all were bosses all right. Your mama's a murderer, your daddy's a coke head and now you, the rapist. Hmm, what a family tree. Dear diary. My life is a mess. Rihanna's mad at me, Kelly hates me, Queen doesn't believe in me and Cedric, I know I'm gonna have to pay for what I did to him. It's time to put an end to the Queen's reign. And how we're gonna do that, we gotta get rid of all her subjects, including the princess. Kelly, I need for you to have Chloe by the shop by 9 o'clock. How am I supposed to do that? Chloe and I don't talk, she'll be suspicious. Use Rihanna as the bait. I'm gonna subdue D.A., and Trina, I need for you to do what you do best. I need for you to protect us. Bet. But, sis, you gotta tell me. How'd you make that happen? We'll talk about that later. Kelly, let's get this party started. It's time for you to make that call. Can I at least do my hair first? I'm a let you out right here. Make sure y'all go through the back. We gonna get these motherfuckers and I'm a handle them at the shop, okay? Bet. Hey, so how can I help you today? I'm here to see D.A. Who? Don't act crazy. I said I'm here to see D.A. Hey, big daddy. Woman, what are you doing here? And how'd you know I was here? D.A., you my man, you know I know everything about you. Look, I don't know what type of games you're playing, but you need to go. You know what? Fine. But before I go, I got a little gift for you. It's real special. What the fuck? Hey, I'm a check things out first. Y'all stay here till I get back, aight? All right. Now you know the rule. Don't pull that out if you ain't gonna use it. Are you ready? Like are you sure you ready to go in here and do this. Dammit Q'Wan. If I wasn't ready, I wouldn't be here. That bitch has my best friend hostage. All I know is if one hair on her head is harmed, I'm capping everybody ass. Well, you make damn sure you do. What's this all about anyway. Nina has her hostage? What the fuck for? Look, I don't know, but I know that she does have her. And I heard them shoot somebody in the background. All right, check this out. They got one lookout, but I heard people talkin' like someone's gettin' beat in there. We gotta go now, all right, let's go. Oh, shit, Ri. Oh, my God, Chloe. Kelly and Miss Nina are trippin'. They have your mom and dad tied up in the back. You know you motherfuckers are dead when this is over with. I can't wait to see y'all bitch ass suffer. You know, shut the fuck up. Shit. I can't see. I'm a kill you, I'm a kill you bitch ass niggas. You won't be alive after tonight to do anything honey. Your reign is over bitch. I'm a kill you motherfucker. Wait a minute, y'all hear that. Trina, go check it out. That girl from your graduation party that we had that fight with? That's Kelly's girlfriend. What? Kelly's girlfriend?
