Even though Gwangju Democratization Movement was violently suppressed by the JEON dictatorship in May 1980, it did not stop the democratization movement by Korean citizen Along the way, the military dictatorship chose torture as the means of the reign of terror. This film delivers the accounts of what happened during the period at the torture chamber located in NamYoung-Dong Nam Young-dong, 1985 'September 4th 1985' Okay, we're here. Why are you doing this? Where am I? Please have a seat here. We are just going to ask you some questions. Until you tell me where and why you brought me I refuse to answer anything. You want this, Bastard? What the hell are you doing? Your clothes are all ruined, right? Take them off. You want us to take them off? Pants, too. Hey, hey, hey! Take your underwear off, too. Kidnapping, illegal detention, and physical abuse were not enough, now you do this kind of shit too? I'll report this and sue you for violation of human rights. Report? How scary, huh? Sue us? Oh my God, I am so scared of you. Have you lost your mind? You son of a bitch! If you're stubborn, you'll suffer more. Please sit down Please write down every detail about your life until now. There'll be plenty of time. I need to ask you one thing. Are we in Namyoung-Dong? Write down every little detail. You'll get out of here free only when you finish writing Listen! No sleep, no food until you finish, Okay got it? KIM Jong-tae was born in Pucheon, Gyeong-gi province on December 19th, 1947 Hey, why did you turn it off? It's noisy. Mr. KIM is doing homework. I thought you were sleeping. I was listening to everything. I heard you snoring. Then, what inning, and who's the pitcher? It's the bottom of the twelfth inning CHOI from Lotte got one out and KIM just hit a double, Dude! What a lucky little aristocrat. I'm jealous. Listening to the game on the radio, sleeping, and earning overtime at the same time. You got everything, don't you? Damn! We lost because of you! Son of a bitch. I'll check on another channel and see if they won... You're gonna call those hookers again, right? 'September 5th 1985, 2nd day' That bitch is from Jeolla Provinces. So what? She doesn't like me because I'm from Gyeongsang Province The biggest victim of regional conflict is me, not KIM Dae-joong. Hey, but I heard she's madly in love with you. Yes, she is. But her dad wants her to get married so she's had 5 blind dates already. But you know, she rejected them all. I can't understand why she can't just move in. She's so naive. She can't make up her mind Hey, break up with her and date my sister. She's better than her anyway. What's the point of a pretty face? Anyway, your sister is an activist. You idiot! She's just not mature yet. And have you seen any unintelligent activist before? She's just too much for me. Hey, his nose is bleeding. Bring some tissues. Don't be so sensitive. Nose bleeds are nothing, right? You got blood on the paper. Write it again. 'September 7th 1985, 4th day' Hey! Just leave him alone. The whole three days he hasn't dozed off once. What a stubborn asshole. I know you've had a tough time, but it all ends with you resigning as the commissioner of the Youth Federation for Democracy (YFD) No more? Yes, after that not much happened. You know LIM Hyung-sik, the Korean History major at your school. Yes, I do. I heard you met him last month. By coincidence. You told him you wanted to think about some idea during your break? Yes, I did. That idea! That's the thing I want to know! Your resignation as the commissioner was just a political show. I've never said that. This asshole is not cooperating. Get ready to move him. Got it. This is the VIP room where difficult fuckheads get the special VIP treatment. Dunk him in. Tell me what you were thinking. Well... Bastard! Dunk him in more! Yes, sir. Hey, BAEK. You should lose some weight. Look, he's sweating so much. You know last time at the company dinner, he finished almost 8 plates of BBQ all by himself. We gotta eat some Korean beef for local farmers. They're having a hard time because of imported U.S. beef. You are saying you are opposed to the importation of U.S. beef? Hey! I'm not opposed to the government policy, but the farmers are suffering from the unstable prices. They can go wild and I'm just worried about my country. He said in his statement that he's worried about the country, too. - You want to go through this, too? - No, sir. Lift him up. What did you try to do? What was your plan? There was no plan. Dunk him again. What the hell are you guys doing? He's a little bit hard to handle, sir Dress him. My boys were a bit hard on you. Nice to meet you. I'm from KyungGi high school, too. You must've been a baby when I was there, though. Having alumni from prominent politicians to powerful activists... Such a great school, isn't that so? I heard KIM Young-sam, the out-party chair wanted you to join the National Assembly. Why didn't you accept? To participate in the democratization movement as an activist suits me better. The democratization movement... So you are proud enough of the anti-government movement to refuse the gold badge? Yes, it does. The Gwangju Revolt, the rioting at the U.S. Culture Center. Are these all part of the democratization movement? Yes. So you're saying that North Korea has always been behind this? Can I speak frankly? I came here to talk with my junior alumni. No reason to beat around the bush. Please feel free to talk openly. The democratization Movement is not connected to North Korea, but it is a movement against the military dictatorships of Presidents PARK Chung-hee and JEON Doo-hwan. You see? It's exactly the same theory as North Korea's political philosophy. The effectiveness of the government is crucial to grow the country's economy. This is even more the case when we are being confronted by North Korea. There are some inconveniences but we have to put up with them. Thanks to our great President, PARK Chung-hee, our economy is now 10 times larger than North Korea's. You agree with that, right? Now, paranoid KIM Il-sung in the North is instigating the subversion of our government through intelligent but naive individuals like yourself, isn't that so? Yes, we've heard this story so many times. The government insisted that North Korea was behind the People's uprising on May 18th But 5 years after, everyone knows it was not the truth. Rather, the fact that the U.S. tacitly supported the military government became well known That is why the occupation of the U.S. Cultural Center occurred How are communists and North Korea related to this? So you're saying it was a main role of the YFD to spread these opinions widely? Yes, that's right. Then why did you quit? You must have had special reason when you'd resign from that important position. I just wanted to take a rest while I thought about things. I'm asking you to talk about these thoughts. Please cooperate with us. If you cooperate well, we promise your safety here, also you won't be harassed when you are released. 'September 8th 1985, 5th day' Shit. Is this bitch trying to test me? - What's this? - Read this. This could have been done on the phone instead of mail. A love letter, eh? Look, you married for love right? I need advice. That guy is never helpful. He's in his forties and all the women he met were prostitutes. You bastard. My girl met a guy because she wanted to get married, and then she asked me about whether she should meet him or not. What the fuck was she thinking about? Are you going to plead the fifth? Sorry, but I don't have those experiences. Bullshit. Hey, this is saying that she likes that guy she met. It means she's comparing you to him, you idiot. If she wants to go to him, shit I'm not gonna hold her back See? When you finish your statement and behave well, you get your meal. Bullshit. Ah, this bastard's doing it again Shit, what are you saying? The violence of the military government that impeded democratization Movement in 80s is the main reason for the misfortunes today. If we can build up a democratic government, almost every problem we have today will be solved. Hey, Mister! Are you trying to educate us with this? You asked me to write what I was thinking after quitting the YFD Hey asshole. I simply told you to write your thoughts not an entire political speech, you dick. You know that statements from torture aren't legally valid, why are doing this? Torture? Legal validity? You asshole. I'll make you confess that you're a damn commie today. So, that is Chilsung-Pan Come here, come. Wait... What is... What the hell are you doing? None of you will get away with this when people find out what happened here! It'll be a huge political scandal! Cut the bullshit! Admit that you were preparing for a violent revolution. You're a damn commie, you son of bitch. Who is behind this? Who's supporting you, huh? I admit that I fought for democratization as the commissioner of the YFD but I've never planned any violent revolution. Cover his head. I am a violent revolutionist! I am a commie and someone is controlling me! I am a violent revolutionist! I am a commie and someone is controlling me! I am a violent revolutionist! I'm... I am a violent revolutionist! Sir, the boss called The Undertaker. 'September 9th 1985, 6th day' All the commies I've seen have tiny dicks. It must have shrunk because it's cold. Did you stomp on his knees? Yeah, just a little. Don't ever do that again. It leaves marks. It's not just the stomping on my knees They never let me sleep, they assaulted me and water tortured me. Son of a bitch. Let's begin. - Wait! - Stay still! No! Don't... Please Wait... wait... No! No! Hold him! Wait! Hold on! Please Wrap him. Wait... Wait... Please No... hold on, just a sec... Wait... No, wait... hold on... wait... wai... Wait, no! Wait... don't! Well, let's get it started. Stronger. This is the highest pressure. Turn it off. Now turn on again. I usually don't rush. Let's take it slow. If you have something to tell us move your toes, okay? His toes are moving. I told you No rush take it slow His toes are going crazy. Isn't this dangerous? Sir, his toes are not moving at all. Hey, KIM Jong-tae. Just leave him. Would it be alright? Let's take a break. No I quit smoking. Please bring me a cup of cold water. Hey, bring him some water. Your skill level has really improved Is that so? There was also a special order from the boss After having GyeongGi Provence in your charge, your job is much easier, right? I have no time to be in the office. Yeah, we go home maybe once a week or less. KANG! You haven't gone been home for over ten days, right? Well, none is waiting for me there. I'd love to at least some money after not seeing them for so long. But we get nothing for beating up these commies. Well, at least you can get promoted quickly here. All my colleagues in other divisions have already bought apartments Though you get promoted here, it doesn't help you in any way. You know Young-sik in the Gangdong office, right? He already opened a cafe for his wife. You don't know anything. Life is hard. My wife runs a small hair salon. Sir, please don't misunderstand me. I didn't mean to talk about you. We all know how hard you... We need to sacrifice many things for bigger issue. Thanks to whom do you think South Korea now exists? You're alive, huh? Gentlemen, it's your patriotism that is basically sustaining the country Ah shit... This is Did you feed him? Uh, yes. What do you really want from me? Restrain him, and don't let him move Damn this guy is tough. Don't stop. Come on. Sir, there's a call for you. Tell them I am working. Ah shit. You shouldn't give him any food when we use water on him That call was from the boss Wrap it up Shit Hey hey, move his hands away. Yes, Sir. Understood. I'm going on a business trip to Incheon for about 3 to 4days Thanks for your effort... Damn, you son of bitch. Give it to me Mr. KIM, see you soon. Feed him first and then get a statement He will be cooperative now. - Thank you for your work - Thank you That motherfucker. Such a snob. Sir, I might have to go home this weekend... What? You said no one greets you at home Well, I promised my son. To see baseball game... You made a good excuse, huh? No, I mean it! I really promised him! Thirty five, thirty seven, thirty nine, forty two, forty five, forty seven, forty nine, fifty two, fifty three, fifty four, Fifty five! Fifty... Whoa! Fifty five seconds You broke the record! That's a lie. I'll set a new record when I go to the beach tomorrow It's September and you want to go into the sea? Come on We were supposed to go to the beach this summer! You're a liar. OK, I'll jump into water with you, my son. I'm sorry. We're here Daddy Did you wait long? What took so long bathing? A breath holding contest again, huh? I'm starving. I want noodles. Noodles. Noodles? Sure. Let's go. Detective Lee? You came here to bathe too? Wait, do you live in this neighborhood as well? I'm sorry but You need to come with us again.

You can eat my share. - See you later - Okay - Daddy, we're going to the beach tomorrow! - Sure Daddy, come back soon. - You know it well.. - Yeah I know Nothing bad's gonna happen. It's pretty obvious. Mr. KIM Jong-tae? Who the hell are you guys? Eat when you are given food Whenever there's torture involved, there'll be no food. Boss. Mr. BAEK! Yes! What is it? I'll be back after a phone call. Don't pass out when you're alone. Who says I'll pass out? Hey, Mr. KIM. Let's make a gentlemen's agreement. It'll take a while for him to call his girls. Let's take a nap for 30 minutes. I can just leave you but... why don't we just take a 30 minute nap each? Thank you. I'll trust you It must have been tough What on earth do they want from me? They want you to lie. The communist dreaming about violent revolution? The mastermind who never existed? That's right, LIM Hyung-sik, that damn kid dragged me in Don't blame him. It was just your turn. My turn? Then what should I do? There's nothing you can do. Just don't resist too much. 'September 13th 1985, 10th day' Your oldest brother defected to the North during the Korean War after drawing a lot of portraits of the head of North Korea and your second oldest brother is a teacher in North Korea now Then, your third brother defected as well, now spies on South Korea. When the whole family are all commies, how can we believe that you're not one? Didn't I write down everything in my confession? I know my brothers went to North Korea but I was too young I don't know why they defected or what they're doing now Mr. KIM, let's be rational here Their youngest brother became a powerful figure in South Korea, and don't you think they wanted to see their proud younger brother? During the incident you met your third bother, right? You wiretapped my home and office, and followed me around. Why are you doing this when you already know everything? Okay. I knew you weren't gonna get the hint. Wait, wait! Hold on a second. What if I lie and tell you that I met him? Then I don't have to go on that table? What? If it's a lie? You, take him over there Wait, Hold on a second! Wait... You gotta wrap him Mind your own business No... don't... Please... please wait... Sir, you will be up there? Just hold on a second I met him, I met him! Where did you guys meet? Well... Um... Please Cover him! I asked where you met him. I, um. That is... Please. You cannot remember? If you do, move your toes. They are moving. Home, at home How can you meet him at home, you asshole? It must be somewhere else around your house. You're right. I met him near my house So where exactly near your house? They're moving. Think back slowly. At the mineral spring near the apartment Good. That makes sense. So when? Just do as you wish. Shit, speak with your own mouth, your damn OWN MOUTH! Think back carefully, okay? I think you met him once during your student movement days Right, you accepted some money too. That's true You must have gone to North Korea as well to organize the YFD under KIM Il-sung Otherwise, how could you dedicate your life to organizing the anti-government movement Sir, sir! Look at his toes moving. Yes I got some money and I've been to North Korea too Who, when, where What, why, how! Tell us every little detail, you fuck! Sir, Sir! I think this asshole passed out again. Hey, hey, asshole! Hey. He'll wake up again soon. What an idiot. It'll be much easier if he just tell us as we want. Will he be alright? Well, the Undertaker said he'll be alright Hey, is he still unconscious? Isn't this a bit too much? What? Too much? KANG. What made you so weak? You don't want the promotion? You idiot Did you see that announcement from the K-CIA or not? They uncovered this huge plot, accusing Korean students in U.S. of being North Korean spies. What the hell are we doing here without results for days? Sir, he's still not moving Shall I call the army surgeon? It's the policy here, so please understand, okay? Yes, thank you. Sir. Thank you for your assistance. We ask again for your discretion. I will come here again tomorrow morning. 'September 14th 1985, 1 1th day' Following is the reason why I resigned from being the commissioner of the YFD. I was afraid that the security agency would find out about my secret meetings with the North Korean spy KIM Jong-Hwan to receive operational funds from him. So, I decided to resign in order to keep the YFD from collapsing under the increased investigations. Well written! Good job This is what we've been asking By the way, where was the place I got the thousand dollars? Was it in Suyu-Ri? Or at the mineral spring in Yeokgok-Dong? Why are you asking him what you did, you bastard? So I think it was a mineral spring, that's right. Wait, I thought we were going to change the place where he took the ship to defect Sir, is it Samcheonpo again? Are you sure that this dickhead came out of the best school in Korea? How can he keep forgetting what he's said with his own mouth? I can't remember well because I made them up when I was in a daze You made them up? I guess you haven't had enough yet. You! Prepare him Wait! No, I just remembered Well, um, it was in Busan not Samcheonpo, correct? You're the one who took that ship so then why are you asking me? Shit, you said Busan earlier today. You're right, Busan. That's right, Busan is right Thank you. Thanks to you, all of us will be on the list for special promotions You always count your chickens before they hatch Bullshit, dude Maybe only executives will get a promotion, but not us. They don't even think about us. Then the confession would have been gotten without us? We were the ones who really worked for it! We worked hard for it. Why are you yelling at me? If only the two of them get promoted, then shit, I'm not going to just stand by If that happens, don't just stand by Looks like that snobby Undertaker is going to learn something from you, Boss Shut up, idiot Shit, I don't know yet. Maybe we were a bit over the top. The Undertaker will be here soon. I heard you treated him a bit harsh Can we talk for a moment Mr. PARK? Your work seemed a little overambitious. There are so many parts we need to modify This says he met his brother in 1974 but at that time, KIM was on the wanted list for violating the emergency decrees Also, KIM met his brother near his house when our agents were staking it out 24/7? This lack of detail will dishonor our agents Mr. PARK Well, usually we can... Okay, well anyway, lets move on It also states that Kim went to North Korea on May 1977 from Busan But at that time, Kim had work status in Incheon. Records of his punch cards are still available and his colleagues will testify for him There are tons more contradictions in this statement It will take more than a month to iron out all these inconsistencies You bastards should've been more thorough Hey, KANG, What the hell did you do? I thought you were closely checking this... huh? Why are you busting my balls? You heard everything, too, asshole! Where the hell were you guys when we were interrogating him, huh? I told you to check carefully if the story matched with his records! Well I went to a funeral for my cousin's grandmother - Where were you guys? - Ah you bastard Ah look, he just woke up Well Mr. KIM, you are awake How do you feel, your condition? I'm okay. Could you please turn off the drip? You were very cooperative Actually, we all know that you didn't go to North Korea. And also, we know that you've never met your brother That really never happened. I know, I know. Honestly, I admit that we were a bit harsh. You can be as harsh as you want. I stopped by to see the boss and the army surgeon was present To my wife, IN Jae-eun. Here NamYoung-Dong. I'm being tortured Damn son of a bitch Hey, bullshit! You try to ruin our lives? Don't hit his face. Kill him. You fucking little dick Damn you son of a bitch Hey, Take it easy Don't go overboard Damn that son of a bitch almost ruined my promotion and my life Wait, if the boss already knows everything are we all gonna get fucked? Shit! The salaries gonna get cut? We be able to go home for about a week now Mr. PARK will take care of the rest 'September 15th 1985, 12th day' Excuse me, are you going to give me any food? If there's torture involved, no food. If there's no torture we can feed you. How do I know about it, you son of bitch Hey, any plans to work on him today? I don't know, shit Maybe they're taking it easy because we hit him a bit yesterday What the hell, then I'm leaving. Stop dreaming, You didn't hear we can't leave for a week? Who said that? Who do you think? Are you fucking deaf? Even this guy knows, you idiot I'll cooperate Of course you will Take this out! I'll do everything you say I'll do everything you tell me to No, please don't! Hold his head Here! How's this? Why, you don't have any appetite? Maybe you don't like spicy food? Look at you, you're holding your breathe now? It is no use holding your breathe. The chili powder will go into the lungs anyway. Open his mouth! This bastard like you must die from emphysema Hey you, bastard Do you really believe the world will change if you let the outside know that you're here? He's sweating enough. Well, let's change the tool. Please stop. Please. Hush, be quite. Open your mouth. Those prints must have arrived Hey! Wrap him. Look carefully at his perineal region because it might be ruptured Okay, got it The towel is dried up. Let's take a break. Excuse me, sir. Can I turn on the radio? A really important baseball game is going on right now It's Haetae against Samsung with the pitcher from Samsung, KIM Si-jin. Turn it on. I'm a big Samsung fan Mr. KANG, how can you be so ignorant of time and hierarchy? Hey BACK, isn't your sister listed as one of those activists? You dick, are you serious or just joking? You, stupid. Why don't you ever shut your mouth? You asshole What? You son of a bitch Man, are you losing your mind because you didn't see your chick for awhile? You damn bastard Ah, fuck it What the hell are you guys doing? Did we classify the Incheon Labor Rights Association as a part of the Democracy Promotion Committee earlier? Yeah I think so. I see. Ah seriously, you assholes. Shut up! I'm listening to the radio. What the hell, you idiots! Our bosses are discussing serious national issues Release him. Shit, that.. part! You know, the peri.. what was it? It seems like it has been ruptured It's not ruptured it's just discharging blood. Sometimes it happens. Take this if you don't want to die. Stand him up. Mr. KIM. Start memorizing this organization chart carefully. Most of them are individuals you've met before You've met most of them before. and over half of them appeared on your statement, too. Memorize and learn this carefully. - We're wrapping up the work for today - Good job, everyone. Now time to play Jeopardy. Shall we? First, the Labor Rights Association?

BAEK will never wake up And KIM... - I'll leave him in your hands - God damn you asshole Please do me a favor I'm going out Have a good time you idiot, okay? The commissioner in charge of liaison, PARK Dong-geun Mastermind of the students movement, KIM Jin-young You memorized it all already? Wow, graduates from top schools really are different Man, I'm fucking tired. Stay alone here a little bit? I'll send KIM right away Be careful. Don't go too far Come here You idiot! What? You stupid.

It might be easier for fucking geeks like you. you can change jobs any time you like, you fuck. But who will hire Someone like me? Yeah, Shit!

I'll never, be able to forgive myself These people won't be able to harm these two men They are men of God after all Are they really going to be ok? 'September 24th 1985, 2 1st day' You suffered a lot in your time here A lot of the youth who opposed Presidents PARK and JEON have changed their political stances Once you get out of here, don't ever participate in any anti-government movements again. You should love the Republic of Korea I truly love the Republic of Korea So how can someone who loves Korea organize a revolution against it? I've never planned any revolu... Wait, were all revolutions against the Republic of Korea? The Student Revolution of April 19th was also against Korea? You may continue. What I was against was the military dictatorship, Because I love Korea, I disagreed with Dictator PARK's military coup d'etat and the new army of JEON who massacred the citizens in Gwangju on May 18th. Sir...! You are consistent in your stance. During the regime of President PARK, you started on the wrong foot and basically ended up as a head of an anti-national organization, didn't you? No, I am stating clearly again. I just participated in anti-government and democratization a activities. All my comrades at the YFD and other organization had the same beliefs. The real ones who were against Korea is the military dictatorship! Committing horrible torture! Forcing false confessions! Get that fucking commie's clothes off! Get everything off!! You fucking son of a bitch. How dare you You already confessed everything to me, and now you are denying it in front of all these people? Hold him down so can't move We need to wipe out all fucking commies like you. Tie him up tight! I told you to tie him up tight, asshole! This fucker! Sir Sir? You son of a bitch. Make that asshole kneel down. Crawl here to my feet from where you are. I told you to crawl! Crawl. Just kill me instead. You know what? I am number 1 on North Korean assassination list But I'm not going to die before I wipe out all the commies in this land You want me to kill you? You know LEE Jae-moon died 6 months after he left here? How about you? Do you want to die a year later? If not, 3 months later? I can choose the exact day and time. I saw a food tray earlier in front of another room. - Bring it in. - Yes, sir. Or should I kill you right now? This way, do you think your death will capture a headline saying, 'KIM Jong-tae, died from torture?' No. We will throw your body with a few bullets in it near the border, and news will say you were gunned down on the way to see KIM Il-sung, I'll mix this up well okay? Eat! Fucking eat! I told you to eat, you asshole. How's that feel? You feel like a fucking dog, right? That's how I felt before! Bark! Woof woof! Bark! You shithead. He can't even bark because he's so weak and hungry! Eat, you fuck! Mr. LEE, the boss is looking for you - You! Come and sit here - Yes sir! Sit still and don't move Until I come back lick it all up and don't even leave a grain of rice. You fucking asshole. Just do as he says. Please... If he says crawl, crawl. And if he says lick, then lick. You fuck! Hey hey. If you keep going like this you'll die here. You need to get out of here alive you need to see your children. What are you doing? You guys, bring that rack. So you're saying that everything you confessed were all lies? So you lied to me? Shit, then you played with me. You should've told us what you really thought. Mr. KIM, so what should we do now? Torture you and let you write on the desk like a human being? Do you wanna write on the floor like a fucking dog? Answer me right away! No? Okay. Let's start all over it again. Put him up on the rack! There's nothing you can do. Just don't resist too much. What the fuck are you doing? Get him up there quick! It's true, it's true! Everything written here is all true. I planned the violent revolution. I'm a commie puppet controlled by a mastermind I'm a commie! I'm a commie! I... admit That's right. I'm a commie I admit it! Everything is true... I declare that all the above statements are accurate 24th, September... September 24th, 1985 KIM Jong-tae You suffered a lot, Mr. KIM. Ultimately, you get out of here alive. It'll be useless to change your statements in front of the prosecutors or judges Patriots never go easy on commies. I know it will never happen but, if Korea becomes a democratic before your execution, then you can take and torture me, alright? Take good care of yourself The prosecution has arrested 26 members concerned Committee of Promoting Democracy, including main culprit KIM Jong-tae... On the way to Gwanghwamun there's a confrontation with police... The ongoing agitation widespread the country Demanding the amendment of an election system... KIM Jong-tae was finally released today after 2 years and 10 months. Police are searching for LEE Doo-han who suddenly disappeared Former policemen were sentenced separately to 2 years and 1 year and hal f... KIM Jong-tae with activist background is elected to the 15th Congress... The Torture Inspector LEE Doo-han turned himself in prosecution... The Supreme Court sentenced the torture expert LEE Doo-han to spend 7 years in prison. The congressman KIM Jong-tae finally accepted the Minister of Health and Welfare September, 2004 It is a National Security Law issue. How does the party feel about it? There's a lot of different opinions. Is it? Yes this is true. Some support abolition. Others support amending the law. According to today's poll results, 14% agree with abolishment, and 66% are overwhelmingly for amendment. Sure, the public opinion is a lot changed. Everyone in Korea has your message, Mr. President "Let's put this sword called National Security Law into a sheath and just keep it in the museum " Let's just move on since this matter is not on our formal agenda today. However, I would love to hear your thoughts, Minister KIM. You were the victim of this National Security Law, aren't you? Of course it should be abolished. I think we can address these contentious issues. Your views are more moderate on this issue than mine I'm on the total abolition side of this law. Anyway, let's see what the public has to say The president is really firm on this issue. No, he's just being very clear Isn't he, Minister KIM? He's amazing. I heard from a journalist that LEE Doo-han studies the Bible in prison. He hopes to be a pastor What do you think? Would you like to see him? He must have heard know that you've become a minister. Why does he want to meet? No one knows. Maybe he wants to ask for forgiveness after studying the Bible. What do you think? I have no interest in seeing him. Transformed from a torture expert to a priest Do you want me to go in with you? I want to see him alone. Okay, I understand. Special Visiting Room So much time has passed. Please forgive me. I'm truly sorry. Please... forgive me. Forgive me. Mr. KIM Jong-tae passed away on December 20 1 1 after suffering from Parkinson's disease caused by the trauma of torture. LEE Doo-han became a radical priest after his release from prison on November 2006. But he lost his priesthood after he attempted to justify his past wrong doings during his ministry and currently his whereabouts is unknown. it is a totally intolerable pain to hear his screams from the room on the other side... People without power, are the ones who suffer most I was so dejected these people accused the innocents and executed them on April 9th, 1975. they refused to return the bodies to their families since they were worried that someone would find traces of torture. Those people see me as a dog or a pig, Nobody should feel nostalgic for that time. Families cried out loudly and it was such a... They held me upside down and hit my sole like this Whenever they hit, my whole body echoed with the pain Of course those torturers should be punished. But I especially wanted to kill the dictator so badly. I imagine all the possible cruel ways to do that one day, I realized that I became an evil person. To tell the truth, I forgave him to not be an evil person Give up being a human, and be a dog. And then we are destroyed together with those who torture us. I don't know at all what will happen to me... For almost 20 years, I have been traumatized by electricity, not even able to get close to fluorescent lights... They said, they would bring my almost due wife, and my children to show them my suffering under torture... There was a female senior. They told her to take a bath and all those policemen watched her from outside But the situation where you can do nothing. That feeling of helplessness... "Brother, never get caught. Torture feels much worse than death." They never stopped torturing me until I slashed my artery Brother, it's better to die than get caught by them "Hey, since you are innocent, if the judge says something, then just say 'l was bad' you'll be released after 1 week or 3 days. After that, let's drink together", and then he waved his hand a better life together But she said she could forgive a murderer but not a spy from North Korea I still have my cousin in Seoul but I rarely visit him Who the hell knows how this world will be changed? I have a son, and students in school bullied him, saying he's the son of a spy I was afraid of physical violence... I hated myself being weak and afraid. So I cried in shame every night in the prison The image of a pig right before it's slaughtered pops into my head the most, that humiliating thing... I was lucky to be found innocent, and be able to talk to anyone without any shame. But among us, there still are people who just shut their mouth from fear. I'm sure there are more people like that than people like me We'll be closer to the democratic country, only when we resolve these past problems made by the dictatorship. This movie is based on the essay by the late KIM Geun-tae and interviews with real victims of torture. However, characters and events in the film are cinematically recreated. Dedicated to all the torture victims around the world
