Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoa! Ruh-roh! Um, is that, like, a good "ruh-roh" or a bad "ruh-roh"? Never mind! I figured it out! Whoa! Whoo-hoo! Here they come. Everything's in place. Everyone ready? Ready. Set. No! Whoa! Whoa! There goes my rental deposit! I hate cats. Whoa! Velma! Daphne! It's go time! More like, Cat Man, don't! Am I right, Scoob? Good show, Mystery Inc! You've certainly lived up to your most formidable reputation. Now let's see who this Cat Man really is. Actually, Inspector, I think Ms. Cat Man might be more accurate. Olive Khadka! But why? Your family owns the ski resort. Exactly. But my father plans to leave it all to his new wife, Heena. She's half his age, you know. What do you think, Velma? Does it match the others? Let's find out. ...creature to scare away skiers and force the lodge out of business. And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for... Hey, where did those meddling kids go? Wow, just as I suspected. The materials used to make the Cat Man suit are identical to every other costume from the criminals we've captured. Henry Bascombe's Space Kook suit. Captain Cutler's ghost diver suit. That freaky ghost clown, Harry the Hypnotist. All starting with the Black Knight, Mr. Wickles. I always thought it was a strange coincidence that all our cases seemed to involve some supernatural creature. But it wasn't a coincidence. These costumes were created by one person, a secret mastermind hiding behind the curtain and pulling the strings all this time. Coco Diablo! Happy Halloween. I'm Coco Diablo. I'm here for the, uh, VIP tour. Of course you are. Right this way. As you can see, we manufacture a wide variety of popular Halloween costumes. Classic gorilla. Silly hot dog. Treacherous maven. We make it all here. Of course, here at Diablo Costumes, we pride ourselves in only making safe, family-friendly products. Of course. We only use the best materials here. None of those chintzy, disposable synthetics other companies rely upon. And our costumes are crafted by true artisans. Excuse me, Miss Diablo. How many times must I tell you not to interrupt when I'm with a client? But I've just completed the prototype for next year's Dracula costume. Dracula, again! Really, Trevor, can't you design anything other than Dracula? Well, I can try to, but... Oh, my! Try harder. That's my apprentice, Trevor. Don't mind him. He shows promise. But he's always wearing those ridiculous hats. No offense. Now, where were we? I'd like to see something a little more scary, if you catch my drift. Of course. Step into my office. So, who told you about me? Olive Khadka. Ugh. Olive, such a shame. I deliver state-of-the-art costumes, and these fools end up getting defeated by those... I appreciate the rec nonetheless. Let me cut to the chase. I got the inside track that a new highway is about to run through Winterhaven. - And I... - And you're looking to buy up the land on the cheap so you can make a monstrous profit. But first, you need a way to scare off the competition. Um, yeah, something like that. I have just the thing. Esteban. Hmm. Looks a bit constricting. I call it the 10,000 Volt Ghost. The cloth conforms to any body type, and you can adjust the current to control the mind of anyone you want to submit to your will. It's my greatest creation yet. How much? For you, it could be free... I'm listening. ...on this one condition. Get rid of those meddling kids who've been destroying all of my brilliant costumes. And their dumb dog, too. That might be a little difficult. Oh. And why is that? Because, like, I am one of those meddling kids. And I am their dumb dog. Whoa! Nice work, Shaggy and Scooby. And as promised, here are your Scooby... Jinkies! You've just helped us nab the mastermind of one of the most notorious costume crime syndicates in the world. The most notorious. But how did you kids do it? It's simple, really, Sheriff. You see, I had a hunch that a lot of the cases we've been solving lately were somehow connected. Scooby and Shaggy bravely put themselves in harm's way time after time to gather clues. While Velma, our resident science whiz, analyzed that data, which led us here to Coco's factory. - Humph. - And Daphne, well, she, uh... She, uh... Uh, what was it again? Fred, don't be silly. You know very well that I... I, um... Come to think of it, I'm not really sure what I did, or what I ever do. I see. Well, good work. Yeah, yeah. Good work. But you know what they say about too much of a good thing. Okay, time to go, Miss Diablo. Fire away, news monkeys! All press is good press. Well, gang, another mystery solved. And with Coco Diablo locked up, things should be a whole lot quieter from now on. Sounds groovy to me, man. Yeah, me too. But what if there really can be too much of a good thing? You need any help with that, Velma? I'm pretty good with whatever it is you're doing. No, thanks. I've got a system. Okay. Well, if you change your mind, I'll just... just be over here. Just what exactly are you hiding in all of this, Mr. Humdrum? Oh, please be a fleet of ghost pirates he wanted to use to scare a small fishing village into selling him their land. Oh! Or... Or maybe let's just see who you really are. Hey, what are you doing? No, stop. Stop that. Oh, that's my face. I can... Oh! Get off... Get off of me! Oh, my eye. Aah! Oh! Sorry, Fred, he was inflating tax refunds for his clients by claiming fake deductions, exaggerating expenses, and falsifying home energy improvement reports. But that's so boring. Take him away, Sheriff, or whatever. Who cares. Uh, not to add insult to injury, but we don't really take people away for crimes like these. Now, Charlie, do you promise to pay back what you owe? Uh... Yes. Okay then, that's that. Hmph. Hey, who ate my lunch? You know, I'm starting to think that maybe it was a mistake... Don't say it, Fred. - Don't say it was a mistake capturing Coco Diablo. - Capturing Coco Diablo. Since we locked her up, we haven't had one interesting case. But it's good a criminal mastermind is behind bars, right? Yeah, good for her maybe. She's becoming a celebrity in there. Her book was a best-seller. Velma, you bought a copy? Oh. I buy every bestselling book written by criminals we put away. It's a helpful way to get insight into the criminal mind. And Coco's prose is surprisingly poetic. Huh! A lot of good that will do us, solving mysteries about missing socks. Dude, the way I see it, fewer freaky cases means fewer freaky ghosts freaking us out. Yeah! So, let's just enjoy this downtime, man. I mean, dude, tomorrow's Halloween! I sure hope I didn't jinx us! Like, wow, Scoob, this is shaping up to be the best Halloween haul ever. Yeah! Trick-or-treat! Uh, Raggy, it's Ricky. Yeah, tricky and treaty. Our favorite candy-related activities. No, Raggy, I'm stuck. - Like, where Scoob? - Here. - Around here? - Uh-huh. I'll try ringing the bell. We'll just use our foot as leverage. Ooh, a raggy roor. Wait. Is this what I think it is? Mm, caramel! This house is made of candy! Did you? I did. You did, too? Happy Halloween! You thinking what I'm thinking? Let's suit up! - Yeah, these will work. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, looks like the gang wants to get a head start on trick-or-treating! Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. After you, sir. No, I insist. Aah! Happy Halloween! Shaggy, Scooby, look, I know you're excited for Halloween, but I've had it with these rinky-dink cases. We need a real mystery. But how? And more importantly, why? I thought about it, and I had a great idea. I say we take a page out of Coco Diablo's book, and drum up a little publicity of our own. Not today, though, right? I mean, today's Halloween. Yeah, we're pumpkins. All right, guys, listen. Just hear me out. What if we set up a booth at the Coolsville Halloween Festival today? The exposure could bring us new business. - Oh! - That's your big idea? A booth at a festival? What's our next case? Judging the biggest hog? Well, that's not all. We could put out a guest book so people can leave their contact information, or tell us about mysterious occurrences in their lives. But... but trick-or-treating! And candy! - Everything okay, Fred? - I, uh... I think I see my grandmother over there. Hi, wishing well. Gee, I feel kind of silly talking to a hole in the ground, but... I sure do wish we had a creepy caper again. Well, here goes nothing. Like, I didn't know Fred was so broken up about this. Yeah, I never thought he'd believe in something as crazy as a wishing well. Must be pretty serious. Maybe it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world to try his idea. Here he comes. Sorry about that. It wasn't my grandma after all. So now, where were we? What? Now, like, just to be clear, the plan is we work the festival during the day, and then at sundown, - we all go out trick-or-treating, right? - Mm-hmm. Of course, Shaggy. Now, why don't you and Scooby go work the crowd a little? See if you can lead some customers over here. And who's to say we don't find some succulent snack age as well! Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! What can I do to help? Oh, uh... Why don't you put the guest book on the table? Fine. I hope I can handle that. Oh, I guess I can. Oh, and maybe open it so people are encouraged to sign it. Got it, Fred. It's not rocket science. Detectives here! Anybody need a detective? Hey, Shaggy, look. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. You know what? We've been working pretty hard, Scooby-Doo. Like, it couldn't hurt to stop for a healthy snack, right? No, sir. Not at all. Why is no one visiting our table? And just how are we supposed to compete with that? Oh. Three, two, one, bob! Was that what I think it was? It sure seemed like a... Ghost! We have to tell the gang. Hold on. This could, like, seriously impede our chances of trick-or-treating. Dude, let's say nothing. Hey, fellas, any luck finding new mysteries for us to solve? What? Oh, no, no. Not much going on, really. Definitely no ghouls or ghosts lurking about. How have things been over here? Like, any big mysteries come our way while we were gone? Uh, what's wrong with Scooby? My good bud, Scooby-Doo here, is just so excited about Halloween he can hardly contain himself. Ix-nay on the ost-ghay. Man! We saw a-a-a ghost! Sorry, Shaggy. Oh, I get it. You're just trying to keep our hopes up because we're not getting any bites. We'll just have to hunker down. If we stay put, I'm sure a new case will show up before... too... long. I'm here for you, Mystery Inc. Are you guys seeing this? Ah, my wish came true. Uh-oh. Ahhh! My brochures! Our guest book! Fred, it's time to run! To the Mystery Machine! Never mind. If that ghoul is here for us, I want to be somewhere else. Wowie! Looks like we got our next mystery, and this one's got teeth! Good, 'cause I might need a new set afterwards. As soon as possible, we'll need to round up a list of potential suspects, beginning with Farmer Avery and that suspicious goat of his. And I'll cross reference that list with any recent land deals in the area. Great thinking, Velma. No, wait. A ghost with a grudge attacking us on Halloween. There's only one person who could be behind this. I think it's time we pay a visit to our old pal Coco Diablo. I love that idea! I mean, you know, it's, um, hmm... It's completely, logically sound. - I like it, too. - Really? But there's no time to lose. Because, like, we gotta solve this case in time to go trick-or-treating, right? Before I show you even more of the high tech modifications I've made to the facility, I just want to say what a tremendous honor it is to welcome you here. I'm a huge fan of Mystery Inc. Yeah, man, you already said that. Three times already. Well, I can't say it enough, given how your mystery solving has kept my prison at full capacity over the years. You meddling kids! Try not to let any of these goons upset you. Mystery Inc? More like mystery stink. Shut your trap! How dare you disrespect my friends like that, you filthy crook! It's okay, Warden Collins. Wasn't even a very good burn. I'll show them. I'll show them all. Oh! What are you doing, man? Don't worry. Watch. I'm free! Watch the pretty coin of gold, and you will do as you are told. Invisible force field. I designed it myself. Gets them every time. Oh, you got to let me show you our new state-of-the-art robotic chef. You just have to see this thing flip pancakes! Raggy, did he just say pancakes? Wait, wait, wait! No! Like, keep it together, buddy. We need to stay focused. Remember, time is candy. Oh, right. Candy. Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah! I'm cool. Tell him, Shaggy. Never thought I'd say this, but, man, there's no time for pancakes today. As fun as this tour has been, we're here to talk to Coco Diablo. Oh, of course. You kids, such professionals. Right this way. Anyhoo, you're lucky you caught Miss Diablo on a day where she doesn't have too many press events planned. Uh... I don't mean to be rude, dude, but we're on a bit of a schedule here. No, no, I got it. Just give me a sec. You have four minutes. Oh, heck, since it's you, take as long as you need. Well, well, well. Look who it is. Jinkies! You don't seem surprised to see us. Word travels fast in here. Heard you're having a bit of a ghoul problem. Hmm, you sure do know a lot for someone who's been locked away. You were behind the attack! Case closed. Let's get out of here, guys. What makes you think I had anything to do with it? Do you really expect us to believe that the mastermind behind all our previous mysteries had nothing to do with this one? Did you see any of my signature designs? What mechanisms did they use to attack you? Did the ghoul's clothes have built-in pockets? Details matter. Hmm. Now that you mention it, we were kind of distracted by being... Terrified! His face was like... And he, uh... So we were like, "Ruh-roh!" Normally, I'm much more observant. There was a lot happening at once. Too bad. If I had been there, I bet I could have narrowed it down to two or three copycats of my work. Wait a second. That's it! Maybe you could help us crack the case. Sure, it'll be a tight squeeze in the van, but nothing we can't handle. Right? Actually, that's not a bad idea. After all, Coco is well-versed in the minds of criminals. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on. We need to carefully and meticulously consider this. Oh, boy, how long is this going to take? Working with the enemy on our first case in a year seems like a recipe for disaster. Huh... But? But at the same time, we haven't had a case like this in some time, and we could be a little rusty. A little help might be... - Just say it already! - This is taking forever! ...something to carefully and meticulously consider. Look, the only way I'll agree to help is if I could be considered for early release. You know, for a good behavior. And helping Mystery Inc. would definitely qualify as good behavior. But I'm just not sure Coco can be trusted. Look, Fred, we need Coco's insights to help identify these ghouls, and she needs us to vouch for her early release. That's trust enough for me. What do you think, Warden Collins? Well, it's pretty risky for obvious reasons. But if you teenagers think it's okay, who am I to argue? But if you're leaving the premises, I need a safeguard. If Coco strays out of range, the necessary parties will be alerted. We just need one of you kids to wear the matching bracelet and serve as home base, if you will. I'll do it! What? I'm curious to see how the technology works. You kids have fun. Scoob, we absotively posilutely have to speed things up here. We've got to crack this case before Coco and her big ideas slow us down. The clock's ticking! Scoob, are you listening? Scooby-Doo? Esteban! My angel of darkness! Ahem, I mean, my angel. Now, Coco, if we're gonna make this work, you play by our rules and don't do anything to distract from or jeopardize this case. Or our plans to go trick-or-treating tonight. So, what do you think about bringing Coco along? Oh, is she coming with us? I hadn't noticed. Yeah, it's just weird, 'cause I didn't know convicted felons were your type. What? Type? Me? Please. Who has time for a... a type? We have our work cut out for us, and I am focused like a laser on... Okay, who am I kidding! I'm crushing big time, Daphne! What do I do? What do I say? Don't over think it. Just be yourself. Oh, yeah. Easy peasy. Hmm. So this is where the magic happens. You guys really do need help if you're driving this. The Mystery Machine took a big hit, but she's still got what it takes to get the job done. Just like us. Like, maybe we should take a different car or a bus or something. Are you crazy? This is the Mystery Machine. Oh, man! I was afraid you were gonna say that. Come on, old girl. Fred needs a new ascot. Boy, listen to that baby purr. So, where are we headed, gang? Let's take Coco to the scene of the crime. She might have some insights. Hey, now is your chance to talk to her. So, uh, what made you get into the business of being bad? I mean, not that there is anything wrong with being bad. Wait. Oh, no, that didn't come out right. Good and bad are subjective. I don't see why innovation and helping people solve their problems would be considered bad. You are so right. You know, one time I got detention... Hi. Sorry to steal my friend here, but I need to talk to her about anything but this. Okay, you're doing great. - I am? - No. Fred, how long till we are there? Uh, approximately one hour. I guess we can kiss all that sweet, sweet candy goodbye. There's always next year. Let me set the stage for you, Coco. Imagine an amazing attention-grabbing booth right here. Why would I imagine that? Fred thought it would be a great way to drum up business. That was my reaction, too. Excuse me, I'm setting the stage here. Anyway, there was a line of potential clients that stretched all the way from here - to the very unpopular goat-balancing act. - Hmm. Sky seemed to change colors and the air smelled like... Kettle corn! No, it... it wasn't kettle corn. - It was like, um, more of a... - Propylene. Judging by the trace amounts of propylene glycol, whoever's behind this clearly lacks imagination. So, we can assume their techniques will be primitive. And since ethereal torpedoes don't actually exist, we're looking for some kind of detonation device that was triggered via remote control. Swoon. Oh, yeah, sure. We already know all of that. Look, making monsters may be your life's work, but catching them is ours. So, if you'll please just trust our process. - Now, uh, where was I? - Hold that thought. What is this? Oh, that's just our guest book for people to sign and write down the mysteries they need solved. Hmm. You'd think we would have noticed something like that. - Does that name sound familiar to you? - No. Whoever it is, this Nefario is our next clue. We are back. What did we miss? Did you guys solve the case? When I said we should look into who this Nefario guy is, this isn't what I meant. You sure do love boring homework. Pfft. Not me. I hate homework. Never done a day of it in my life. Or have I? Who can say? Because I am very mysterious. Ah, here it is. The "Life and Crimes of Friederich Nefario." Oh. "Deep in his castle high in the Carpathian Mountains, Count Friederich Nefario gathered members of high society from across Europe to form a council with a sinister purpose. He called them together because they were each uniquely suited to carry out his grand plan. There was his dear friend, Daisy, a vain and spoiled socialite who had everything but it was never enough. And Helga, a scientific genius who knew it all. All but the difference between right and wrong, that is. And finally, Craggly and his trusted attack dog, Rudy, whose insatiable appetites often led them down the wrong path. And so, on this fateful Halloween night, Nefario opened the ancient tome and..." Wait a second. Is it just me, or is there something strangely familiar about this group? I don't see it. Can we please get back to reading? Yeah, the clock's ticking. "Nefario opened the ancient tome and read from the sacred text, inviting them to join the most enticing fellowship called Misery Company." "Upon initiation, they would receive the gift of eternal life, not only outliving their children, but also their children's children and their children's children's children and their children's children's children's... "- Man, I can't take it anymore! Let's see here. "According to legend..." blah, blah, blah. Aha, here it is. "Misery Company got to live forever. But in return, they were forced to maintain the balance of good and evil in the world." So, like, if there was too much good, they had to balance it out with evil. Then blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Boom. The end. That's the clue! Move on! Shh! Need I remind you that you are in a library? No! But why would this Misery Company be coming after us? It's obvious. You goody-goodies disrupted the balance. You caused there to be too much good in the world, especially after catching me. Now the ghouls are after you to set the balance right again. So, if I were you, I'd keep an eye out for this Nefario guy. He's right behind me, isn't he? Mm-hmm. No wires, huh? Can't wait to talk shop with whoever you are when this is over. Your technique is quite impressive. I'm here for you! On the bright side, at least Nefario's friends from the book didn't decide to join him. Quick. Let's split up, gang. I'm here for you! I'm here for you! Me too. Dude, ix-nay on the Andy-cay. Relax, I got this. Okay, but get me some, too. Zoinks! Yikes! I don't know how much more I can do. I'm here for you! Just kidding. I was built for this stuff. I'm gonna live forever! Wow, you were able to miniaturize the turbo pump for the actuators? I'm impressed. Oh, that was easy. The hard part was getting comfortable carrying rocket fuel and parts around all day unnoticed. Wow, I'm being myself. Look out! I hate coming to the library to do my homework. Awesome! Now I have an excuse to not do my homework! Like, what are we gonna do? Okay, gang, ahh, this is just like old times. Here's the plan. - Let's split up and... - We just did that! Shh. This is all very disruptive. I could have you banned, you know? We know. So, does anyone else have a plan? I think we're overdue for some good ideas. Oh! Library puns. I've got an idea. Yo, ghoul breath! Follow my lead. We're here for you! You know, I expect this kind of thing from kids these days, but someone as ancient as you should really know better. You should respect the rules! You should respect authority! You should respect the fact that this is a library, and in the library, you be quiet! Quick, this way. Oh, some help here, please. And don't you ever let me catch you being loud again. We are here for you! Shaggy, it's just a costume. You're gonna need to leave it behind. No, I can't do that. I can't trick-or-treat without a costume. And I can't get all that candy unless we trick-or-treat. One of the great paradoxes of the universe. Like, dude, that was a lot of fun and everything. But I don't think we're any closer to solving this case! Yeah, or trick-or-treating. And now, instead of one ghoul, we've got five after us! What kind of dangerous road are you leading us down, Coco? I'm sure that Coco made some brilliant observations in the encounter we just had. The cute one's right. Esteban, show them my brilliant observations. Black lace. Platform boots. Tacky cloak. Top hat. I know who is behind this. And I know just where to find him. Oh, my! A customer! But what do I do? What do I say? Just be yourself, Trevor. Your dark and beautiful self. Greetings, seeker of darkness, and welcome to Trevor Glume's Boutique of... Hello, Trevor. ...Doom. My, my! Look how far you've come. I'm so proud of you. Hello, Miss Diablo. Yes. A lot has changed since you were... Well... Excuse me! Those are not food! Anyway, I finally had the emotional space to pursue my own personal style. Your own personal style? Just looks like more Dracula costumes to me, Trevor. Admit it! You're trying to steal my old business model while I was locked away, unable to fend for myself! I... I don't know what you're talking about. I'm talking about how you've been conspiring to destroy Mystery Inc! What? Where were you an hour ago? I was here dealing with my multitudes of satisfied customers. I was very busy up until the moment you came in. Would you mind proving that? I don't think that's necessary. What does security footage really prove anyway? Rewind it. Rewind it more. Rewind it a lot more. Keep going. A little more. More. Stop. Go back. Enhance image. Enhance more. Well, it's sad, but it is an alibi. Looks like... - Looks like... - Sorry. Looks like we've hit another dead end. So much for that early release, Coco. Oh, come on. Can you blame me for thinking this tacky weirdo designed those ghoul costumes? Maybe you'll get some real customers if you got some actual taste. I do have real customers. In fact, you should know that I received the biggest order of my life just last week. Oh, sure. With who? Goths 'R Us? No, that was two weeks ago. Last week, I sent some of my finest Victorian creations directly to Coolsville Penitentiary. Coolsville Penitentiary? What are you looking at me for? Mr. Glume, could we see the paperwork for that order? This is just the connection we've been looking for. Looks like Coco might be giving us the runaround after all. Trevor fulfilled a big order for someone at the prison last week. And Coco just so happened to be at the prison last week. I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding. Man, it's Coco. Just like I said hours ago. Now, can we please wrap this up? Ugh, what happened to these receipts? They're all smudged. Haven't any of you ever cried at work? Oh. Hey, don't worry. That's okay, buddy. Hey, where did Coco go? Okay, it's starting to look less like a misunderstanding. Oh, man, we still haven't solved the case, and now we've got to find an escaped convict, too? Worst Halloween ever! Oh, no. Look! I think it's time we go and investigate the old Diablo costume factory. Wait a second. Oh, for the love of Scooby Snacks, what now? If we're gonna do this right, we got to do it in style. This is the awesome montage part of the case where we spruce up the Mystery Machine. Can I help? I don't know. Oh, why not? Hurray. Well, it's not what I expected, but... it's exactly what I expected. It is my greatest creation yet. Farewell. I suspect Coco tried to throw us off her tracks by accusing Trevor Glume. And when that backfired, she lured us here so she could ambush us at her factory. Where she has the upper hand. Coco has all her old secret weapons here. We have to stay on our toes. Creepy. Oh! Like, really creepy. Don't worry, Shaggy and Scooby, it's only mannequins. Like, dude, totally knew that. Yeah, we were just practicing for the real ghouls. Who are probably close by. Maybe we should split up and look for clues. Really? You mean it? Dude, whatever keeps us moving. No question about it, guys, we have to split up. Got any aces? No, you took all of them. Wait, do you hear that? You're supposed to say, "Go fish." That sounds like... It was implied. Us! Do you have any Jacks? Go fish. I think you're cheating! What kind of fool needs to cheat at Go Fish? Hmm. We might not be able to trick tonight, but maybe we can still treat! - Oh! - No! No, no, no, no! Just our luck! Why would I even need to cheat? You have a terrible hand. I do? You're just jealous because I'm the pretty one. Looked in the mirror lately? Silence, you fools! Time is upon us to ambush those meddling kids. Oh, no, what should we do? Let's see. We already split up and looked for clues, so... Okay, here's the plan. We need to... Run! We are here for you! Huh? Whoa! Whoa! I always knew I was the complete package, but this is ridiculous. Help! Somebody help us! Help! Help! Anybody! Zoinks! Like, is that what I'm think it is, Scoob? Help us! Please help us! - Anybody help us! - Yeah, it is. What do we do? Mm-hmm. We got to do the one thing that we don't want to do. Oh, no. By giving up doing the one thing that we do want to do. You mean... I do! Hey, ghouls, don't forget about me and Scooby-Doo. Yeah. This whole franchise is named after me. We are here for you! Oh, sorry. Thought you were somebody else. So long trick-or-treating. I guess we'll never know who those ghouls really were. Robots? We're here for... So if the ghouls were robots, that means someone was controlling them. And I'm pretty sure it was... Me. That's right. I did it all. I built the robots and programmed them to get back at you for taking me down. Huh? Oh, oh, and I would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for you meddling kids. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Even though I suspected you were behind it the whole time, something about this doesn't feel right. Agreed. Seems a little too easy. And this confession doesn't seem like your style, Coco. And where is Esteban? Hmm. Hmm. Like, hey, I think Scooby's on to something. What is it, Scooby? Come on, let's follow him. Esteban is in here. No! Don't look in there, please! And someone else, too. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. I bet whoever that is is the one who's really behind this. But, uh, just to be clear, when we open this door, we'll be done with the case, and who knows when the next one might... - Open it, Fred. - You bet. Warden Collins! Hi, Mystery Inc. So, it was Warden Collins behind this assault on Mystery Inc. the whole time? Only the Warden is technologically savvy enough to program robots this advanced. And, like, obsessed with Mystery Inc. enough to make them look just like us. And only the Warden had the ability to free Coco from her tracking bracelet. He brought her here, then took her adorable kitty cat hostage... Not that adorable. ...in order to force a confession out of her. But why? You kids may not know this, but I'm your biggest fan. You've given me ten times as many inmates for my prison than the Coolsville Police Department. Hey, now that's cold, but true. But after putting away Coco Diablo, all your cases dried up. And when I saw how desperate you all were for an exciting new mystery, I just wanted to do something to repay the favor. I wanted to give you the most exciting mystery of your young lives. I used the technology I perfected at my prison to construct the scariest ghouls I could imagine. Evil doppelgangers of my heroes! Then I carefully planted clues all over town. And when Coco Diablo got involved, I knew that she would be the perfect dupe to pin it all on because she was already serving hard time. No harm, no foul. So, this was all just a big favor for us? Mm-hmm. Maybe there really can be too much of a good thing. But you were never in any real danger because I could always turn off my evil robots with a push of the button. Oops. That one deactivates all the security force fields at the prison. Well, turn it back on! Right. Of course. Uh, wait, wait. Which one was that again? Uh... Wait, wait, wait. Uh... Oops. What's this now? Another one of the warden's tricks? It's a Halloween miracle! We're free. Free! Free! I think "oops" is the wrong word, Warden. I know, but this is a family movie. All right, gang, it looks like our work isn't even close to done. Maybe you should try not to look so happy. You're right, Shaggy. That's something that I'm working on. We've got to do something. But we're no match against so many villains. Yeah, you'd have to have some kind of super powers to stand a chance. But don't worry, kids, Coolsville Police Department... I might be able to help with that. Esteban. Like, Scoob, maybe we didn't miss out on Halloween after all. Uh-uh, no way. Like, come on, Scoob, it's the only costume left. Come on, Scoob, you're ruining it for everyone. Humph. Give it to me, you little banister biter! Hey, you didn't say trick-or-treat! Ha-ha, too easy! Mommy! Mine! Okay, gang, let's split up, and nab us some convicts. Hey, there's one now. Hope you miss prison food because you're going right back to... Oh, apologies. You have a very convincing costume. Have a great night. And stay safe. Geesh. Grown-ups. Go figure. Come on, gang, let's get to work. Hello, children. Not much exercise in jail. That candy you're holding looks quite valuable to me. I'll appraise it and offer you a competitive price for it. What are you talking about, mister? It's called stealing, kid. Wait! What's it worth? Now, if I were an escaped convict, where would I hide? Oh! Hey, Mr. Wickles, what a night for a knight, huh? Is this that karma everybody's always talking about? Huh? What the... Oh! It can't be! Sorry, Captain Cutler. Didn't mean to dampen your Halloween spirit. Boo! Oh, Henry Bascombe, you were always such a scream. You want to give me all your candy. We want to give you all our candy. Wouldn't you rather teach this evil doer a lesson? Yes! No. No! My work here is done. Hand over all of that there candy or else. Kitty! Oh, such a sweet little shmochy-woochie. Yes, you are. Forgot I'm allergic. Dagnabbit! Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Wow, look at us. We did it. Coco's costumes sure were a big help. When you use these costumes for good, they're not all bad. Okay, time to take this riff-raff back to prison. Now, when I call your name, please say... Not so fast! Empty your pockets! Do as the scrawny hippy commands! You know you can't eat that candy, right? It's stolen. But, like, didn't you say good and bad are subjective? Only when it applies to me. - Oh, so close! - Yet so far away. For some reason, everyone thinks I'm wearing a costume and keeps giving me candy. I'm on a strict liver and goat-milk regimen, but I thought you two might enjoy it. You know, Trevor, despite your dark and gloomy exterior, deep down, you're a golden ray of sunshine. You... you really think so? Like, no question about it, man. Absolutely. Well, how about that? You were totally right! Catch you dudes later! Thanks for your help today. I'd like to think that under different circumstances, we'd really get along. Oh, really? Oh, there I go saying the wrong thing again. No, it's just that I thought we got along great. Do you know how rare it is for me to like someone other than myself? Jinkies! My glasses. I can't find my glasses. Friends. No. Agreed. So, I've been meaning to talk to you, Freddy. I was thinking about, you know, my role in the gang. What do you mean? No offense, Fred, but I think I should be the leader of Mystery Inc., not you. Whoa! That's a strange thing to say. I'm sorry. I know it sounds crazy, but I just feel like... But, Daphne, you've always been the leader of Mystery Inc. Wait, seriously? You remain calm under pressure, you're the person that everyone turns to for advice, and you make it all look effortless. That's what a true leader does. Inspires others to do their best, and leads by example. I have a much more important and prestigious duty of driving the van! Like, if tonight has taught us anything, it's that you really can have too much of a good thing. Right, Scooby-Doo? Another great paradox of the universe. Well, with this case all wrapped up, Coco Diablo back behind bars, and the prison getting a new warden... Wait, Charlie Humdrum, the tax accountant? I'm used to working with criminals. I guess things will go back to being pretty quiet again in Coolsville. Not necessarily! I got to say whatever magic this is, you did a bang-up job. I wish for more cases, as many cases as you can throw our way. Big cases, spooky cases, wild cases, we're ready! Thanks, wishing well. And hey, Happy Halloween.
