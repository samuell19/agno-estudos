Okay. Okay. I hear you. ...quite severe storminess... ...the beginning part of the day. Clouds in the North Country, partly cloudy... High pressure coming down from Canada. ...further south over the next few days. Futurecast shows clouds are hugging the tops of the mountains for a while today, for sure. Stronger winds coming through the afternoon. Low pressure from the North also bringing rain. Possibly some snow among the higher peaks. If you're doing anything outdoors today, make sure you bundle up for that. Temperatures could drop below freezing, with a bit of a breeze, which will make it feel even colder. Overnight tonight, very cold. One of the coldest nights we've seen for a while. And that possibility... May need this one. Can't forget you guys. Ow! Yoo-hoo? Oh! - Look who wants to come and see you. - Look at my little baby. Little piece of... Ooh. I love this dog. I know. That face, I can never get over it. Look at you. You know, I don't like you going up there alone. Cell phone service is so unreliable. Mmm. - Well, you can be my chaperone. - Oh! Can you be my chaperone? Thirty years of scrambling up those trails daily. I'm done. Nope. But not Pam Bales. Nope. Hey, Pam, you seen the weather forecast? Don't go up there. You know what day it is. Yeah. Anyway, it's cheaper than therapy. And the mountains always listen and never talk back. No holdin' back on the cocoa. - Cheap bastard. - Oh! How many ex-husbands do you have again? Too many. Boom. Thank you. Uh, jacket? - Watch the weather. - I will. Hey. Be safe.

Uh, you have probably heard the news. But, uh, call me if you need anything, okay? Bye. News. An update from the amazing story from Mount Washington, New Hampshire. Pam Bales has been identified as the lone woman who tracked and saved a young man close to death from exposure on the Westside Trail in a heavy snowstorm. The man, who has asked to remain anonymous, informed the police of the woman's daring attempt to rescue him and praised her bravery in bringing him down off the mountain all on her own. From details the man gave from the badge on her jacket, we were able to identify the 53-year-old experienced member of the Pemigewasset Valley Search and Rescue team. His report states that she found him close to the summit after he had collapsed from the extreme cold. He'd given up, but against the odds of bringing down a man twice her size, Pam Bales refused to give up and managed to save his life and bring him home. Hey, Pam, it's Rich. Yeah, got your message. Uh, sorry, no. He left no phone number, no address. Not even his name. Just some story about looking for a woman. That's it. Sorry. Bye. Hi. Pam Bales. Uh... ...you just missed her. Oh. Damn. Well... I could swear the woman I've seen on the news was looking a lot like you. If you see her, Pam... Maybe you can ask her to contact me. If you see her. Hey, uh... I think there are a lot of people that want to just say thanks. For you. Thanks. Right, so... have you heard from him? John? Not a word. Hmm. And what do you think he was doing? Doing? What... Up there? In November. Dressed like that. Why does it matter? Because I'm gonna try to find him. Why? You were up there for hours. You saved this man's life. Maybe he wants to tell you something. If he wanted to do that, he would have done it. Maybe. But there's only one way to find out. I, um... The jacket and the pants. Threw the socks out. Didn't think you'd mind. I don't. Dave will be happy to have his jacket back. I don't even know what to call you. John is fine. John is good. Okay. How's your ankle? Getting better. Ten toes? Ten fingers? I can't see her face anymore. That's what's so surprising. I never expected to... forget a face so easily. Uh, I know every detail, but I... I can't see it. Like, I know she had little lines when she smiled. A birthmark on her cheek that you could only see when it was cold. And where did she go? What does it mean... to... to die? That was a year ago. When you found me, I'd gone back up there to look for her. I almost stopped looking for her. Then I realized I didn't need to look. I could just wait and she would come. So I sat down and I closed my eyes... and I waited for her to speak to me. But you spoke to me instead. Thank you. See... Mmm. There was a gas leak in my building a long time ago. I slept in the living room on the couch with the window cracked, I woke up and... I... I couldn't stand. And I see it every day in my head. I remember... I remember the paint on the walls... the, uh, feeling of the carpet on my hands and knees. And I was crawling to my little girls' room, saying, "I'm coming. I'll save you." But I didn't. I couldn't. They were five and six. And I wanted to die just like you. Does it get easier? Even in the storm, even in the pain and the wind... there is so much beauty. The whole universe appears as an infinite storm of beauty.
