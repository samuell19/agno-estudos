David sells His violin ﻿(Requiem for a Baal Tshuva) A poem by Yosef Ozer ﻿"David's fingers drove the violin wild, ﻿"he hadn't yet shorn his curls, ﻿"a wonderful guitar string sang in David. ﻿"Now David is in the study-house, ﻿"he puts up a notice on the black bulletin board: ﻿"Hey, folks, I've become religious. ﻿"I'm selling my violin... ﻿"For sale: an easel, fine brushes and oil paints. ﻿"Colorful shirts in exchange for white ones. ﻿"For sale: Innocence. ﻿"Because now David wants to buy a new David ﻿"and he buys a sweat stain on the brim of black hats. ﻿"He buys the pride of the persecuted ﻿"and the melodies of his childhood are elbowed from his memory ﻿"by niceties in Yiddish. ﻿"His son Hillel will never hear a violin again." My ﻿name is Moti Barlev ﻿and I'm your guide on this tour ﻿which is a sort of personal journey for me. ﻿It's a journey in the footsteps of Baalei Tshuva (newly religious Jews), ﻿among them, my parents. ﻿People who grew up secular ﻿were on a great quest, they grew closer to Judaism and... ﻿tried to find in Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) society what they were looking for: ﻿closeness to God ﻿and mainly the intense religious passion. ﻿Disappointingly, Baalei Tshuva were outsiders in Haredi society. ﻿It was hard or impossible to get their children admitted to their schools, ﻿and they wouldn't let their children marry the children of Baalei Tshuva. ﻿What I always wondered about my Baal Tshuva parents was, ﻿Are you blind, not noticing that you are not welcome here ﻿Don't you realize you aren't wanted here? ﻿As the years passed ﻿the children held up a mirror to their parents ﻿and their religious transformation ﻿and said: Look, this is what your great search for truth led to. ﻿Reflected Light A film by Mordechai Vardi ﻿Muhammad... ﻿Just bring cement, I have wire here. ﻿What? -Just bring cement, I have the wire. ﻿We were raised in this hallucination, ﻿We came home to a delusion, trying to imitate another delusion, ﻿you know what I mean? ﻿You're neither here nor there. ﻿On Shabbat you have to study Talmud with your father, ﻿go over the week's material, ﻿and your father studies like a Baal Tshuva, ﻿you don't understand the kind of language he uses, ﻿and this applies to everything. ﻿They do not know the inner codes of language and dress ﻿Once my dad came to my school with a pipe, ﻿sandals, and a Baal Tshuva's Tsitsit (fringes) hanging out. ﻿The court jester arrives. ﻿They wanted us in their fantasy ﻿like everybody else around. Industrial peace. ﻿"Go to cheider (religious school)." ﻿"Dad, I'm not going to cheider." -"You won't just go, you'll run." ﻿If you don't go, you run. ﻿"Like it or not, you'll dress like everyone else..." ﻿"Dad, I look like a clown in this suit, ﻿"I don't know how to wear it. ﻿I don't have a Haredi brother or uncle to show me." ﻿You aren't Haredi and you aren't secular, ﻿because you were taught from childhood that the secular world ﻿is also a load of crap, all the hedonism, ﻿the gluttony, ﻿and when you go out ﻿you want a beer, at least. ﻿My dad ruined even that for me, ﻿My dad ruined even that-fer- me, ﻿going to bars and dancing like a fool. I can't do it, you know? ﻿That's why I stay at home, work in the village, come home, ﻿and most of my friends are Arabs and Russians ﻿and we don't understand each other.- ﻿It's a quandary. We aren't secular, we aren't Haredi, ﻿we aren't gay, we aren't Baalei Tshuva, ﻿we aren't anything. What are we? I don't know. ﻿You're experiencing everything as a mystery ﻿there's no explanation, ﻿it's all one big chaotic mess. ﻿You keep trying to get things straight but it feels like chaos. ﻿I don't consider myself secular. ﻿I don't consider myself religious, either. ﻿Those terms are small and idiotic ﻿and they apply to small, idiotic people. ﻿If the test is whether I eat on Yom Kippur, during the fast. ﻿well, I eat on Yom Kippur and I'm completely okay with it ﻿and I think my God is okay with it, too. ﻿He's fine with it. ﻿He thinks it's magnificent. ﻿I serve God every day. I get up at 6 a.m. ﻿and go to work. I don't steal, I try not to lie. ﻿I try. It doesn't always work. ﻿I don't hit others, which I used to do a lot. ﻿I serve God / and try to heal myself. ﻿Too bad my dad doesn't understand. ﻿You know what I'm saying? ﻿How are we different? ﻿I can say that my father loves people. ﻿I don't, really. ﻿You don't love people? -I think people are stupid, ﻿disgusting. ﻿Because my experience was that you have to hide the fact ﻿that you weren't raised like them, ﻿you aren't part of their society. ﻿You have to make up for the differences. ﻿You know what I'm saying ﻿Apart from other Baalei Tshuva, Apart from other Haredis. ﻿When we studied, didn't you realize that I have a deep understanding of the Talmud? ﻿Sure, but that's not what I'm looking for. ﻿For me, a Talmud scholar father who's connected to God, ﻿that's not what a kid needs. Right. -That's what I'm saying. ﻿A kid wants to belong, ﻿he wants to grow up like everyone else. -Right. ﻿And I knew I didn't belong. ﻿There are the Holtzmans and the Shpichtzmans and whoever, ﻿and then there's me. ﻿Did you know we were fighting for our place? ﻿Yes, but I had nothing else to give you. ﻿I realize you had no choice. ﻿One day you took us to the rabbi, a pervert ﻿with his box of torture tools, who shoved lipstick and tangerine peels ﻿into kids' mouths, ﻿a bunch of serious creeps. ﻿An awful experience. ﻿could tell you I made a mistake here and there. ﻿I can accept it and say: ﻿Enough already, you did what you could, ﻿maybe it was, cruel. It's possible. ﻿That's me. ﻿I'm in an accepting place now. ﻿may be troubled about this son that way, ﻿and that sen in another way, but... ﻿I try to see 'the big picture. ﻿I try to see... ﻿I'll ask you something else. ﻿In general, do you like the way ﻿your children look like? ﻿I don't see my children... ﻿I don't see them.. ﻿as failures. ﻿On the deeper level, religious people ﻿are inspired people. ﻿Deep people. ﻿I'm not so concerned about the Torah laws, ﻿keeping the books of laws. ﻿although I don't take them lightly. ﻿My Judaism isn't only about cleaning lettuce on Shabbat, ﻿if you're allowed to remove worms off the lettuce. ﻿I think social justice, connecting with all Jews, ﻿the relevance of the Torah to other sectors ﻿and to me, ﻿not adapting my life to... ﻿to two clauses in the books of laws. ﻿so it fits like a glove. ﻿Authenticity, be authentic. ﻿If you're not authentics, you're playing a game that doesn't exist. ﻿What will you gain? Nothing. ﻿may have spoiled your joy of life, ﻿since life really is... ﻿What do you want? ﻿Thank God, you don't think that backgammon is the meaning of life. ﻿I grew up here. ﻿See those yeshiva students? ﻿That's how I looked. ﻿My parents chose to join a totally different, closed society. ﻿All these changes they couldn't make, ﻿and the society they joined ﻿rejected them, as well. ﻿We were strangers. We didn't belong here. ﻿They're Baalei Tshuva. ﻿The wife walks stooped over, ﻿the father's trailing with a plastic bag. ﻿And the Haredi couple on the right ﻿walks more confidently, ﻿it's a wholly different story. ﻿He's a classic Baal Tshuva. ﻿Classic. His hat is old, ﻿he's carrying a cloth bag that no one else would carry. ﻿No question... ﻿a 5-year-old kid would recognize him ﻿as a Baal Tshuva. ﻿That's where my parents live. ﻿You don't have a childhood in the simple sense of the word. ﻿You're also alienated from your parents. ﻿They had a mystical experience, ﻿a super-intense experience of revelation. ﻿In the girls' schools, where we learned Judaism, ﻿Whatever the rabbis said, we went, "wow, wow..." We wore 70-denier stockings, ﻿buttoned up our blouses, you-name it. ﻿Hadassah Oved ﻿They told us to get married - we did. They told us to have children - we did. We did everything right, ﻿but the time comes when you say: Hold on, stop the train. ﻿I have something to say. ﻿I have something to say, too. ﻿I have opinions, I have a personality, ﻿I have a-will of my own. ﻿And that's what we want today, to stop and say: ﻿Hey, what's your name? What do you want? What do you think? ﻿This conference is only the beginning, God willing, ﻿of something much bigger and much more serious, We need to find our path. We have a second generation of young-men and women, ﻿and if you don't yet, you will soon, ﻿because the little ones grow up. ﻿At the first conference we focused on ourselves, the women. ﻿Who we are, our identities... ﻿what we have in common, what we're going through. ﻿That was the aim of the conference. I'm trying to figure out what comes next. We figured we'd address the second generation. ﻿That's what I wanted to discuss with you. ﻿What bothers me now ﻿is the question of our children. Who are they? ﻿Who are you? What is your experience? ﻿You feel like you have no place, no home, no identity. ﻿Nothing. ﻿I still feel that way. ﻿Ask the children of Baalei Tshuva, ﻿they have no home, no identity. ﻿They won't be Haredi because Haredi society is so inflexible ﻿and so unaccepting of others, ﻿and you can't adopt their dress code, ﻿and to them, ﻿if you don't accept their dress code ﻿you aren't part of their society -Like what? ﻿The way they dress. -Give me an example of a code that you know ﻿and your father doesn't know. ﻿Curling peyois (sidelocks). ﻿Baalei Tshuva don't curl their peyois, ﻿or even worse, since the peyois are considered important channels ﻿for funneling endless bounty from high, lofty worlds ﻿to our lowly world, ﻿they should go from the forehead to the back of the skull. ﻿To a Haredi kid it's scandalous, ﻿What are you thinking, coming here with the bald head and the long peyois. ﻿Are you crazy ﻿It's not even part of the Haredi makeup. ﻿Okay, you screwed that one up. ﻿Okay, I corrected you, you go to the barber ﻿and he curls your peyois into tight curls. ﻿He puts on his Shabbat shtreimel (fur hat), ﻿he chose an old shtreimel, a "Baal Shem Tov" shtreimel. ﻿Idiot! Buy a decent shtreimel. ﻿The Baal Tshuva has to buy a $2,000 shtreimel. ﻿His whole being rebels and says... ﻿I have to buy a $2,000 shtreimel? -I became religious ﻿in order to serve God, ﻿and now I have to buy a $2,000 shtreimel. ﻿What the...? I'm buying a brand-name! -Right. ﻿What should I do? ﻿Okay, I'll atone for my sins, I'll buy a shtreimel. ﻿Let's say he's wearing all the right clothes, ﻿"What's with the white socks? ﻿"Are you crazy? Who wears..." ﻿"But nobody sees." -"Of course people see ﻿"When you sit down, people see your white socks ﻿"and know you don't belong." ﻿They'll never get it right. ﻿And you know what? ﻿Even if they have all the clothes ﻿can tell a Baal Tshuva by his walk. -Right. ﻿"He's a Baal Tshuva." -Just by looking at him. -Just by looking. ﻿"He's a Baal Tshuva. ﻿"He isn't from here." ﻿We put a lot into our children. ﻿A lot of.. ﻿With a very broad perspective, ﻿with the best intentions, and we did everything anyone could dream of. ﻿Did any of your kids leave the religion? ﻿Not exactly, ﻿I have a daughter who... ﻿is going through a process, along with us. ﻿It's an intense, crazy process, and... ﻿everything I couldn't imagine happening is happening. ﻿Becoming religious is a very egoistic spiritual journey. ﻿You underwent a very intense experience, ﻿through that experience you became religious, ﻿through that experience you became Haredi, ﻿and we're totally out of the picture,. ﻿When my parents told me ﻿about experiencing a great light... ﻿I want to know what that light is, too. ﻿I can make it easy for you. ﻿You'll never feel it. ﻿I felt someone grabbing me by the hair, ﻿it was no rabbi, ﻿no friend. ﻿I made the decision overnight. ﻿I woke up in the morning ﻿obligated to all 613 commandments. ﻿Tefillin - now. Prayer-shawl - now. Observing Shabbat - now. ﻿Torah - now. Getting married... ﻿Now! ﻿Were you attracted by the Haredi identity? ﻿At first it was imposed on us ﻿The hat, the suit... ﻿And they told us it doesn't matter how you dress. ﻿What do you mean, they dressed you in a hat and suit? ﻿They were very clever. ﻿They said: Your truth is much bigger than a hat and a suit. ﻿So you figure: What do I care? ﻿What do I care, ﻿but you gradually realize ﻿that it's... ﻿creeping over you. ﻿Did you ever wonder: What is this nonsense? ﻿All the time. ﻿I felt that the garb wasn't me ﻿Did you ever tell your kids who you are? ﻿No. ﻿That's a trauma that's haunted me for years. ﻿"We followed the mystery blindly. ﻿"How could we give up our innate assets? ﻿"We experienced breakdown, loss, abandonment, confusion. ﻿"It was a small table at a Tel Aviv cafe ﻿"that took me in. ﻿"I came to say goodbye to Tel Aviv's sidewalks. ﻿"To the city's awesome secularity. ﻿"If I hadn't been convinced of the truth of this amazing process, ﻿"believing with all my being, I could swear we were all under a spell. ﻿"Insane, in the most dangerous way imaginable, ﻿"that we'd lost the simplest, most basic element of self-defense: ﻿protecting your sanity. ﻿Yes, that's... ﻿You were drawn into it... ﻿you had no choice, you were under a spell. ﻿No, it just seemed like a spell. ﻿It must've felt like a spell, too. ﻿How did you accept their institutions? ﻿The schools and the society and... ﻿I didn't accept them. I had no choice. ﻿That sounds awful, "I had no choice." ﻿It is awful. ﻿But essentially, that's the truth. ﻿So you sent me to a Haredi high-school. ﻿when deep inside you knew I shouldn't be there, ﻿it wasn't the way you wanted to raise me, ﻿but you were a captive of the system ﻿so you rolled it... ﻿onto us, too. ﻿I call that irresponsible. ﻿You should've said: If you don't want my daughter, I ﻿don't want you ﻿That's called having confidence ﻿in the path you've chosen. ﻿That's what happened, you all lost your backbone ﻿when you joined the ultra Orthodox world. ﻿The first thing they did, boom, like they cut their hair, ﻿they lost their backbone. ﻿When I stood before that high-school principal I felt like... ﻿Either I kick his butt ﻿or I swallow the insult. ﻿I chose to swallow the insult. -Naturally. ﻿And that shattered me. ﻿Why am I sitting here with you ﻿Why do I need this? I ﻿need it because.. ﻿it's... ﻿a move toward freedom. ﻿Toward understanding, toward truly internalizing the situation. ﻿Are you free yet? ﻿Well, I'm... ﻿many, many years younger than you ﻿and my opinion doesn't count, but I'm still ahead of you. ﻿I've moved on. ﻿For years you were super-religious ﻿and I had no idea ﻿you came from a different world. ﻿No, when my dad was born they gave him a hat and coat, ﻿he couldn't be anything else. ﻿Then it struck me? I Hold on, ﻿my dad wasn't born ultra-Orthodox. ﻿Your tattoo, for instance, ﻿for years Mom told us it was a birthmark. ﻿What a crackup. ﻿Daddy, can I have a blessing? ﻿A Shabbat blessing? -Please. ﻿Like the old days... ﻿"May God make you like Sara, Rebecca, Rachel and Leah..." ﻿We haven't met since the Beit Meir Conference. ﻿You really made me mad... Big-time. ﻿That's how I like it. ﻿I'm not Sephardic, I'm not of oriental origin. ﻿I'm not a Breslav Hassid, ﻿and I lived in ﻿a typical Ashkenazi community, of people from European origin. ﻿that accepted me completely. ﻿And there I met you, ﻿at the Beit Meir Conference. ﻿Thank you. ﻿The idea is to present things ﻿which are really open for discussion. ﻿And everyone should express his opinion. ﻿If we don't try to help ourselves ﻿no one else will help us. ﻿"If I am not for myself, who will be for me?" ﻿We're taking on a poverty mentality ﻿and we don't realize that we have tremendous strength. ﻿This fear, this weakness, this lowliness, ﻿works against us. ﻿My name is David Karpas. ﻿Baalei Tshuva are an amazing thing ﻿but we're a fleeting episode in time. ﻿With all our faults, our issues, our problems, ﻿we're a fleeting episode. ﻿My son won't have to deal with what I deal with, ﻿my grandson definitely won't... -He's a fleeting episode, too. ﻿That's right. I'm talking about the continuum into eternity. ﻿Excuse me, Rabbi, it's okay to think otherwise. ﻿It's okay to think otherwise. But to say that I'm a fleeting episode? ﻿You said we're a fleeting episode. I'm eternal, I won't go away. ﻿We aren't a fleeting episode. ﻿We're a social-spiritual experiment by God. ﻿We're the model, we aren't a fleeting episode. ﻿We have to speak honestly, this is an emergency meeting, ﻿because the Tshuva movement is caught today with its pants down. ﻿If you're Baalei Tshuva, chances are 50-50 ﻿that your children will be secular. ﻿We know this from experience. ﻿The challenge of the Baal Tshuva movement ﻿which is a new branch of Judaism ﻿is that the majority still denies the fact that it's a new branch of Judaism. ﻿That's the whole problem. We, the model, must formulate a new religious approach. ﻿So... ﻿I felt I was different from the Haredis ﻿from my very first day in a Haredi yeshiva, for Jewish studies, ﻿but I never saw myself as the ugly duckling. ﻿I always saw myself as the swan. ﻿I never felt inferior ﻿because I'm a Baal Tshuva. ﻿I always saw it as a virtue. ﻿I knew I had an advantage over them. ﻿He's a better Talmud scholar than I am ﻿but he isn't a better person than me, ﻿because I'm more into closeness with God. ﻿didn't mean to become Haredi, ﻿there just wasn't any other vessel that could contain my light. ﻿I looked for the most authentic thing ﻿and that seemed the most authentic ﻿so I said: This is the truth, I'm going all the way. ﻿And I went all the way. ﻿It was very hard for me. ﻿Not that I'm a saint, but when you expect it ﻿to be an exemplary society ﻿and you see that it's... ﻿I don't want to say anything bad, but... ﻿A lot of lies, a lot of injustice. ﻿When one of my daughters ﻿went to a Haredi high-school, ﻿24 hours before the school year began we got a phone call ﻿saying she'd been rejected. -Wow! ﻿"We hear she does terrible things. ﻿"She has internet on her phone..." Lies. But then no Haredi high-school would take her. ﻿Impossible. -It's true. ﻿My daughter stayed home a whole year. ﻿I remember being... -Broken. -No. ﻿took a baseball bat ﻿and I went to smash his kneecaps. ﻿But you didn't do it. -I didn't. -Too bad. ﻿But that's how I felt. ﻿That's when I felt.. ﻿the blow. Where did that come from? ﻿Where did that come from? ﻿After years and years of being deep inside ﻿I couldn't be part of it any more. ﻿It's all gossip. ﻿"We heard..." All sorts of rumors. ﻿I look at him: I saw him, his stockings, his... ﻿That's when the penny dropped. ﻿That's when I realized it's no fleeting episode. ﻿We are no fleeting episode. ﻿My kids aren't like the neighbors kids. They never will be. ﻿They grew up in my home, ﻿they're like second-generation Holocaust survivors ﻿who experienced the Holocaust through their parents, ﻿they experienced Tshuva through their parents ﻿which is why I say that they taught me ﻿through feedback, through reflected light, ﻿that we have to be ourselves. ﻿Good even ﻿My parents became religious in the late '70s ﻿with the wave of Baalei Tshuva who went straight from secular society ﻿to Meah Shearim (a fanatic Haredi neighborhood). ﻿I married at the age of 18. By the time I was 21 I was a father of two ﻿and I decided to leave Haredi society and religion in general. ﻿Later I also got divorced. ﻿As I see it we're a lost generation. ﻿If I could convey one thing from this meeting, ﻿it would be really nice ﻿if we could meet regularly, ﻿maybe with a moderator, and process what happened back then, ﻿go through a process. ﻿My parents became religious and they lost their minds, ﻿they lost their common sense, their... ﻿They threw away their values, ﻿and yes, my parents accept me as I am, ﻿but there's no dialogue. ﻿As a child I idealized I didn't belong there. ﻿I realized I didn't belong there when I was 7 or 8. ﻿I realized it wasn't real. ﻿The question of identity ﻿and searching ﻿concerns all of my peers. ﻿I'm undergoing the process inside. ﻿I still look Haredi to many people ﻿because I wear black and white, ﻿but Moti might notice that I wear cotton pants, ﻿but... Right? ﻿But it's significant. ﻿Who I am, what I am, where I am, how much I am, why I am. ﻿Why I grew up this way, why I live here, ﻿why I wear a shtreimel on Shabbat, why I wear white socks, ﻿why... ﻿I ask myself these questions. ﻿Maybe there's a built-in uneasiness ﻿that doesn't let up. ﻿Which cheider did you go to? -Breslav. ﻿That was hardcore. -Terrible. ﻿They abused us ﻿physically and emotionally. -You didn't speak Yiddish at home? ﻿Of course not. -So you learned Yiddish in cheider. ﻿Yes, I learned Yiddish in cheider. ﻿remember once I innocently spoke in Hebrew ﻿with a friend, a fellow sufferer, whose parents were also Baalei Tshuva. ﻿The principal, this tall German guy, ﻿put his briefcase dawn, ﻿slapped me nonchalantly, dispassionately, ﻿picked up his briefcase and walked away. ﻿And that was far from the worst. ﻿They gave me hell because "you're Sephardic ﻿"and you're worthless, your parents are Baalei Tshuva, ﻿"you're worthless, ﻿"you're ruining our community..." ﻿It was endless suffering. ﻿Can I challenge you ﻿Why not become secular? ﻿Just throw it all away? -Because I do believe. ﻿I believe in the Torah, believe in God. ﻿There are a lot-of contradictions. ﻿I can't say I haven't considered it. ﻿But I have a lot of responsibilities. ﻿With the path I'm on today, ﻿vis-a-vis myself, my daughters, my family, it's not an option. ﻿And I don't like that thought, ﻿I'm a religious person. ﻿I love the religious life, ﻿but not the way I was raised. ﻿I'm not part of the society I was raised in. ﻿As you describe it, you're heading for destruction. ﻿Why do you think so? -What do you mean by destruction? ﻿If you stay in Beitar, your kids will come out messed up. ﻿Are you messed up? ﻿I am. -I'm messed up, too, ﻿we all came out messed up. ﻿It's really very simple. ﻿I was afraid to admit there was a problem here. ﻿I didn't want to admit there are problems. ﻿I wanted to keep pretending I belonged ﻿because I made it to the best yeshiva, ﻿was one of the best students, but then you have a baby, ﻿you see it isn't working but you're still in denial ﻿and you say: If I do this and that ﻿it'll work eventually. ﻿And... ﻿suddenly the problem hits you, ﻿big-time. -You look the problem in the eye. ﻿Then they reject our daughter ﻿because we aren't really Haredi. That's another blow. ﻿If we leave Beitar we'll be starting a new life ﻿because it's not just leaving a city, ﻿it's changing something very significant. ﻿We thought the best thing would be ﻿to integrate into Israeli society as Israelis. ﻿Not secular, but Israeli. ﻿To live our lives as who we are ﻿and not apologize for what we aren't. ﻿"The Lord is my salvation, I shall trust and not fear; ﻿for God is my strength and my song and He is my salvation. ﻿"And you will draw water joyfully from the springs of salvation. ﻿Salvation is the Lord's, Your blessing is on Your people. ﻿"The Lord of Hosts is with us, our fortress, the God of Jacob. ﻿"O Lord of Hosts, happy his he who trusts in You. O Lord, save us, ﻿"may the King answer us when we call. ﻿"The Jews had light and joy and happiness and veneration, ﻿"may we also. I raise my cup of salvation and call the Lord's name." ﻿L'chaim. -"Bless You, ﻿O Lord our God, King of the universe, creator of the fruit of the vine. ﻿"Bless You, O Lord our God, King of the universe, creator of spices." ﻿Let me smell it. ﻿Smell it. -Mommy... ﻿"Bless You, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who separates holy from profane." ﻿Amen. ﻿Mommy, give me dinner. -Sit down and I'll bring it to you. ﻿It's 1 a.m. ﻿and we're in a park in the heart of Beitar. ﻿We're here on behalf of the Elem Foundation, ﻿an organization for youth in distress, ﻿in Haredi towns it's called the Back to the Community project. ﻿87% of recognized youths are the children of Baalei Tshuva. ﻿We find the schism among these kids in places like this, ﻿the schism, the adversity, the unhealthy side. ﻿Over the past 40 years ﻿a group of secular Israelis from different walks of life ﻿has tried to integrate into Haredi society, almost all of whom are Baalei Tshuva. ﻿The integration wasn't a big success, ﻿and that's both the title and the bottom line here, ﻿the non-acceptance of the children of Baalei Tshuva ﻿by Haredi schools, ﻿and this has very serious implications. ﻿The time-bomb ﻿of the children of Baalei Tshuva within Haredi society ﻿is a grave problem, ﻿you see it on the streets in all the Haredi neighborhoods, ﻿the most problematic youths are the children of Baalei Tshuva. ﻿According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, in 2011 over 200,000 people ﻿defined themselves as Baalei Tshuva. ﻿Baalei Tshuva underwent a traumatic process ﻿in Haredi society. ﻿They lost their ability to express themselves, ﻿their responsibility, their faith in their abilities, ﻿and gradually became anachronistic to themselves, to their families and to reality. ﻿There are countless ways to fix this. ﻿The first thing is to stop attaching ourselves to the Haredis ﻿because that's irrelevant. ﻿The second thing is ﻿to create everything for ourselves. ﻿I didn't like the Haredis dealing, with our issues ﻿Let me deal with our own problems. ﻿I opened a school. ﻿I want my education to be broadminded, pluralist, ﻿unafraid, open. ﻿together, together, together, together... ﻿In the... ﻿Talmud Torah. ﻿If we don't know about how the State of Israel was established, ﻿how can we understand where we are today, ﻿where we're going? ﻿My father was made secular so that I could start a fresh religious life ﻿Rabbi Kook said: "If you deafen someone you pay for his whole body." ﻿was detached from Judaism to discover everything anew. ﻿brand-new. ﻿The Tshuva movement made a big mistake. ﻿They went the wrong way, they adopted a Diaspora mentality, ﻿and the second generation rejected it. ﻿They wouldn't accept it. ﻿A new doctrine must arise. ﻿I expect us to foster thinking people, ﻿not people who say: I think this because my rabbi said so. ﻿Let's say you open a yeshiva and you can do whatever you want. ﻿What would the yeshiva be like? ﻿What would its headmaster be like? ﻿I'll tell you what. ﻿Where I'm at today, ﻿It's like everything is open to change. ﻿Rabbi Yehuda Greenwald ﻿Everything is open for discussion. ﻿Really. ﻿We're returning to Israeli society ﻿without adhering to old patterns ﻿so we have to create new terms for Judaism. ﻿I want our children... ﻿even if they're out on the streets, ﻿they should have values. ﻿If we could make this happen ﻿I'd want to raise my children from scratch. ﻿I'd raise them completely differently. ﻿Wealth and honor and long life ﻿Praise God, exalt Him, for he is true ﻿In honor of the groom.. ﻿You were part of Haredi society for years. We identified as Haredis, ﻿not as Baalei Tshuva, ﻿but what you just tried to do ﻿is create an identity as Baalei Tshuva. ﻿don't understand... ﻿You define yourselves, your identities, ﻿as Baalei Tshuva. ﻿Maybe that's,enough for you, ﻿but how do you pass that on to next generation who had no such experience You're right about that. ﻿You won't be able to do it. ﻿Why are society and identity so important? ﻿Who cares? -Because every society ﻿has a way of dressing, a way of behaving, ﻿it's a social construct. ﻿You want your child to know how to act, ﻿to know who's one of us and what isn't. ﻿You need these things. ﻿I'll tell you something. ﻿I fit in well in the Haredi world. -Yes.. ﻿I didn't get screwed. ﻿I never had trouble getting my kids into schools, ﻿I didn't go through all those traumas, ﻿but for years a lot of who I am ﻿was pushed aside. ﻿Now I feel like I've returned to when I just became religious. We need to know that creating the community is a statement, ﻿and the statement is that we failed, as Baalei Tshuva, ﻿to make an impact from within. Why do I have to be subservient ﻿to their institutions and their rabbis? ﻿We have brains and we have things to pass on to our kids. ﻿That's right, without following the Haredis. ﻿I don't want my son in a school where everything is allowed. ﻿It's so dangerous. ﻿It's like letting the child ﻿choose what he wants to be. ﻿I don't want my kids to go out into the world ﻿hostile to "these Goyim, these gentiles." ﻿"These secular Jews." ﻿I want to feel secure enough ﻿that if that's what steers them wrong, ﻿let them go wrong. ﻿I'm not a pushover ﻿and I don't submit to everything. ﻿And now I'm going to build something from scratch. ﻿It's so hard to overcome the trauma ﻿without a psychologist and pills and electric shock, ﻿it's not easy. ﻿It's a process. ﻿I'm Oded Nitzani and I'm the chairman of Nettiot, a network of communities of Baalei Tshuva ﻿which offer two kinds of solution. ﻿One is creating special communities for Baalei Tshuva, ﻿and the other is various problems, unemployment, ﻿education, etc. We're here for... ﻿the issue of education. ﻿Our experience with our daughters is very negative. ﻿There's no institution that can really accept and understand these girls. ﻿They notice right away that... ﻿they aren't like the rest, ﻿and that pushes them to the fringes. ﻿Do you have an idea for a comprehensive solution? ﻿To create a framework 'that answers the needs ﻿of the girls and their families. ﻿There'll have to be an emphasis on identity. ﻿I want to put something on the table. ﻿The Haredis we study with want us to be Haredi, ﻿the question is, do you want us to be Zionists? ﻿Can we just be ourselves? ﻿You're essentially saying: We want this group ﻿or this class or, in the future, this high-school, ﻿to have an identity ﻿that doesn't exist yet. ﻿Not Haredi, not nationalist-religious, ﻿it's all that, but it's something new. -Exactly. ﻿We'll have to build it together. ﻿A cooperative effort. -Right. ﻿Many tools... -Who's backing you ﻿In terms of what? ﻿I don't need anyone to back me. ﻿I've been Religious for 38. years, I started when I-was 18. ﻿I'm the rabbi of a 30-family community in Maalot. ﻿I had 100 families in my community when I left Beitar. ﻿With a higher yeshiva, a religious school and a girls' school. ﻿I'm asking whether you have any... ﻿financial backing. ﻿Do you have any financial backing? -No. ﻿Our kids are on the streets, they hate Judaism, ﻿and it's a shame. Not everyone understands the Baal Tshuva mentality, ﻿who they are, what they go through. ﻿Problems with income, childbearing, lack of skills. ﻿The whole situation... -Are Baalei Tshuva's ﻿income problems different from ﻿those of non-Baalei Tshuva? ﻿The Baal Tshuva loses all his confidence ﻿on the most basic level: Making a living, education, ﻿men and women can't work in the same place, ﻿"oy vey..." and so on. ﻿Okay. -Then, naturally, the woman has kids... ﻿Of course. -She became religious at 25, ﻿when the child is Bar Mitzvah she's already 40, ﻿and she wakes up: Which yeshiva do I put him in? ﻿What...? Where? ﻿Then you realize you aren't loved or wanted. ﻿still can't understand ﻿how a woman who was 20 when she became religious ﻿who comes from a totally different world... ﻿You said she has child-rearing issues. ﻿Everyone has child-rearing issues, okay? ﻿That she has child-rearing issues because she became religious... ﻿seems. ﻿What's the connection? ﻿She gives birth every 18 months. Seven children... ﻿Why does she give birth every 18 months? ﻿Because when you take that path... ﻿If you want to be religious, ﻿that's what you have to do. And you want to do it. ﻿You have to go from one extreme to the other. ﻿This process doesn't lead you to religious Zionism, ﻿it leads you to Baalei Tshuva. ﻿We're now trying to put that "tribe" together. ﻿This sector is standing up and saying: I want to be proactive. ﻿This huge sector that wants to become Israeli again, ﻿that Israel is missing out on. ﻿Haredis say: You aren't Hared ﻿You didn't study in yeshiva so you don't get funding... ﻿Secular Jews say: You aren't secular, you're super-Haredi. ﻿Basically, we're... -Okay. -Neither here nor there. ﻿And we now have almost 300,000 adults ﻿with lots of kids who consider themselves Baalei Tshuva. ﻿Nobody knows where this is heading. ﻿Today is a red-letter day. ﻿We're beginning a new year with an extra framework, ﻿second-generation Baalei Tshuva. ﻿What we're trying to do is make these girls happy, ﻿to give them some peace of mind. ﻿They have no educational framework that strives to make them happy. ﻿Such a thing doesn't exist. ﻿Here with us is Feigy, ﻿I want to thank Feigy and her husband who moved here from Beitar. ﻿Feigy's parents are also Baalei Tshuva ﻿so it makes sense that she be here ﻿because she's even closer to the girls than we are to our daughters. ﻿I was always a bit of a troublemaker. ﻿was pressured into marrying when I was 17 because they were afraid I'd leave the path. ﻿I don't think a 17-year-old girl should be married ﻿or pregnant. A 17-year-old girl is still a girl. ﻿She should go to school and have fun. ﻿The religious world is all about masks. Totally. -The secular world also has masks ﻿but I've never lived in their world. ﻿come from the Haredi world. ﻿Miriam, how did you experience their hypocrisy? At school they called me a tramp. -They called me a thug, too. ﻿And I'm so not a tramp. ﻿They called me a tramp. ﻿Feigy, am I a tramp? -You're not. ﻿Feigy, when I was in 8th grade ﻿I asked what God is, okay? -Okay. -In a Jewish Philosophy class. ﻿I asked Mrs. Schlesinger what God is ﻿and she said: Come to the head of the class. ﻿I went, and she said to everyone: See? ﻿This is how she was raised and who knows how she'll turn out? ﻿I'll never forget, my first day in 1st grade ﻿the principal told me to draw a house and a boy. ﻿I drew it ﻿and handed it to her, and she... ﻿You know how they have glasses and short straw-like wig? ﻿Yeah... -Oh, no... -She looks at it, ﻿my parents are all stressed, waiting to hear if I'll be accepted, ﻿and she looks up and says: ﻿Why is there no mezuzah (a holy artifact) on the door? ﻿Not only were my parents Baalei Tshuva, ﻿I'm Sephardic, so my slang was... ﻿God forbid. ﻿The rift between Ashkenazis and Sephardis was totally shocking. ﻿I'm telling you, ﻿we sat in four rows, two rows of Ashkenazis ﻿and two rows of Sephardis and we didn't speak to each other! ﻿I know I have issues, ﻿sometimes I break down in tears, ﻿I miss home, I miss the familiarity at home, ﻿but this is where I belong. -Amazing. ﻿I never thought I'd find a place where I could say: ﻿This is where I belong. -Yeah. ﻿I never thought these words will ever leave my lips. ﻿When I left the religion ﻿I was very bitter. Don't you see what's going on? ﻿What I, an 18-year-old boy, am going through? ﻿That you're joining a problematic society where you don't belong? ﻿But leaving the religion ﻿actually made me respect them. ﻿I learned to respect them, ﻿and over time I learned that people who leave the religion ﻿and Baalei Tshuva have similar profiles. ﻿They're both restless, uneasy, ﻿always searching, asking questions, going crazy and driving others crazy. ﻿When I was your age I did everything out of fear. ﻿I won't do this because I'll break this rule ﻿and I won't do that because I'll break that rule. ﻿I'm not afraid or threatened. ﻿Now that I've started to study the Zohar, Kabbala, Baal HaTanya, ﻿Rabbi Nachman's books, which were the most encouraging, ﻿all his stories and fables, ﻿I realized that the true pleasure in life is... ﻿the world of Tertah. ﻿Kids these days who lose faith ﻿don't feel the pain they should feel when that happens. ﻿They feel like a weight has been lifted. ﻿You also have to beware of the parents. ﻿Kids don't become more religious than their parents. ﻿If their parents are religiously "low," they won't reach higher. ﻿Some kids don't understand that God is something else. ﻿Here, I'll explain. ﻿If I try to explain to an ant what a car is, ﻿will it understand? -No. -Kids don't understand ﻿that it's exactly the same as explaining to an ant ﻿what a car is. Exactly. ﻿You don't understand. ﻿If you gave up, ﻿you don't understand. Why do you say I gave up? ﻿You gave up. -In what way? ﻿If you're no longer religious... ﻿You think I have a problem with religion? ﻿I respect your search, but I prefer religious kids ﻿with broad horizons... I have broad horizons. ﻿I see my soul getting stronger, ﻿but if I go for broke ﻿and talk to you about philosophy ﻿and be as open-minded as I want to be, ﻿I'll go astray. ﻿You have to avoid people ﻿who make you feel bad. ﻿Not that you make me feel bad. you have to avoid those who bring you down. ﻿"I hereby write God's great name in the name of His holiness." ﻿When did you first discover the Torah? ﻿When I was 16, 16 and a half. ﻿At the end of high school. ﻿And it grabbed you ﻿Yes. ﻿Very much. ﻿I'm doomed to be stuck between worlds. ﻿You don't have to be. -Why not? ﻿I can't see myself making the leap of faith you've made. ﻿You don't have to, ﻿and it's not you. ﻿Not me? Are you saying I'm a semi-heretic? ﻿No. ﻿No, I don't think categorizing is... ﻿think categorizing is good ﻿when it helps a person, ﻿but when it doesn't it's an unnecessary restriction. ﻿The need to constantly categorize. ﻿Look, I keep Shabbat. ﻿I don't know why I keep Shabbat... ﻿Because of: "The Israelites shall keep the Sabbath?" -Why not? ﻿What's wrong with doing what your grandfather's grandfather did? You keep Shabbat because... ﻿Because Shabbat is a divine commandment, ﻿but I'm not there. And I will always be torn. ﻿Look at your life for the past six years. ﻿You changed and changed some more ﻿and grew and fell and got up again ﻿and rose and plummeted... you know? ﻿It's foolish to think you can plan what you think... ﻿You're here now, ﻿it's your choice, here and now, and it's big enough ﻿and requires enough energy and sophistication... -Right. ﻿Just stay where you are. ﻿But, if we're so dynamic... ﻿so, where does marriage come in if we're so dynamic? ﻿The fact is, it does. ﻿No, you're dynamic, you like one woman now, ﻿tomorrow you won't. ﻿And you're a totally different person. ﻿"I hereby write God's great name in the name of His holiness." ﻿You commit yourself to someone ﻿because of a certain position you're in ﻿and tomorrow you're in a totally different position. ﻿You can grow and change with your wife. ﻿It's not a matter of changing, ﻿you're a different person, it no longer makes sense. ﻿You know? ﻿You're taking on irrelevant fears for no reason. ﻿"If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its cunning, ﻿"may my tongue cleave to my palate if I don't remember you, ﻿"if I don't place Jerusalem above all my joys." ﻿My brothers became religious 20 years ago ﻿and joined Rabbi Oded Nitzani's community. ﻿He turned me on. I'm not ashamed to say it. I'll ﻿say it. ﻿The Rabbi's son. ﻿I'll stop smoking on Shabbat when Miriam asks me to. ﻿For now Miriam doesn't want me to stop smoking on Shabbat ﻿because that's not where I'm at. ﻿Of course I do, it's no secret, I say it in front of him, too, ﻿I even pray for him. ﻿I want him to know Judaism from t-he place I know it from, ﻿because it's not the same place he knows it from. ﻿Love conquers all. ﻿It's true, but those words scare me. ﻿All my life I've told myself: Don't get married, ﻿don't make that mistake, ﻿be careful, be consistent about that one thing. ﻿"With this ring I consecrate you to me by the laws of Moses and Israel." ﻿Consecrated, consecrated, consecrated! ﻿"This is your firstborn son and God commanded you to redeem him ﻿"for five silver shekels." ﻿"Bless You, O Lord our God, King of the universe, ﻿who sanctified us and commanded us to redeem the firstborn son." -Amen. ﻿Honestly, I feel sanctity. ﻿Really. I feel... ﻿It takes away my anger, my petulance, ﻿my hatred. ﻿It's a Mikveh (ritual bath). ﻿Really. This is... ﻿two seconds after she was born. ﻿When she looked at me like that ﻿I said... -You understood everything. -"She's one of us." ﻿"What am I doing here?" ﻿I said: She's one of us. ﻿Tsippi sang and prayed, she was a state of religious ecstasy. ﻿Poor thing... -Yeah. ﻿On Yom Kippur I went to synagogue. ﻿I fasted. I'm not a part of it. ﻿And what's the alternative? Not to fast? ﻿That's even worse. ﻿I hope my heart opens, ﻿maybe something will happen. ﻿It's silly for you to say: "I've sinned, I've betrayed..." ﻿You won't believe what you're saying ﻿I some people serve God by saying: I haven't sinned, I haven't stolen, ﻿"I'm normal, God loves me." ﻿Did you go to synagogue? Did you pray? ﻿Did you use a prayer-book? -No, just at night, for Kol Nidre, ﻿so the congregation could say "we're pray with the sinners." ﻿What do you want your son to be? ﻿Haredi? Secular? ﻿I think about that a lot, ﻿what kind of schools he'll go to. ﻿I don't think secular schools ﻿are any better than Haredi schools. ﻿He'll be what his mother raises him to be. ﻿There is a problem. ﻿Because Tsippi will be the dominant one when it comes to her education. ﻿You know? -Why is that a problem? ﻿I want to leave my mark, too. ﻿You'd better not leave any mark, Moti. ﻿Let Tsippi run things. ﻿That was no dilemma for me. ﻿Why not send him to your dad's school? ﻿Maybe I will. ﻿With Grandpa Oded. ﻿It's complicated.
