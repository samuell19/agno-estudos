[man] There are currently ten documented cases in Gornick County alone with seven of those cases coming from a small farming community. Officials... [sound distorted] ...virus may have a wider reach, but those with symptoms have gone undetected or come forward at this time. There is growing skepticism on the actual cause of the virus and state officials are hesitant to declare this... - [sound distorted] - ...until further investigation into the matter. The bodies of ten people were found in a mass grave site outside a home in Downtown Bishop Heights. Investigators believe the owner of the home, Charles Hagenah, a registered nurse at Bishop Memorial, was taking the bodies from the local morgue and bringing them home over a period of ten years. It is unclear what Hagenah's intentions were with the bodies as investigators comb through what they call, "a house of horrors." Connecting Hagenah to the ongoing Corpse Walking case could finally bring the bizarre mystery to a close. Further details to come as the ongoing investigation continues. The latest in Global Warming news brings the discovery of toxic spore plumes spreading through upper regions of Antarctica. Scientists have discovered a growing fungus... - [growling] - ...in areas of shrinking ice and snow. The fungus seems to... [man on radio] However, the company does plan to provide that service this coming Christmas holiday. Oh, okay, this story has just come across the news wire. A large portion of the northern side of the city has been struck by a power outage. Gornick Power officials are saying they are unable to trace the source of the failure, but they have crews working quickly to rectify the issue. We'll keep you updated as that progresses. In what seems to be a related development, twenty people have been admitted to Gornick Hospital suffering from what doctors say is an extreme respiratory disorder of undetermined origin. All those admitted are from the northern area where the blackout has taken place. Oh, hold on a moment. I'm getting an updated report here. We are now going to throw it to our local field reporter Michael Adams, who comes to us from Gornick Hospital. Michael, what can you tell us? [Michael] Thank you, Sam. I'm here at Gornick Hospital, that's in the area affected by the widespread blackout, on the outskirts of Gornick County where they have shifted to emergency generators until power can be restored. Hospital officials here have declined to comment at this time on the nature of this respiratory disorder affecting at least 20 people admitted for treatment within the last two hours. Speaking off the record, one doctor told me that all of those admitted were showing symptoms of high fever, nausea, difficulty breathing and strange discolored splotches on their skin. The doctor speculates that these infections may be bacterial in origin, possibly from a local water supply around Wesley Farms. A driver for West Paramedics told me that she responded to several emergency calls from homes in the small farming community, and individuals working at the local farms, where the blackout has occurred. At this time... [static buzzing] [Sam] Michael, can you hear us? Huh. We seem to be having a bit of interference here. That was Michael Adams with the latest update from Gornick Hospital. Within the last few minutes, KLME News Radio has spoken with a spokesperson from Gornick Power that tells us several smaller communities outside the northern part of the city are also starting to experience power outages. An outside source tells us that transformers near the water substation blew and sent showers of sparks a hundred feet high about 45 minutes ago. Gornick Police are now reporting that power lines from the blown transformer fell onto two passing cars near the 300 block of Parker and Clybourn, fatally electrocuting a driver in one car and a passenger of another. Motorists are urged to avoid Parker and Clybourn as there is a large traffic back up at this time. I'm Sam Lummens and you're listening to KLME News Radio. We've got more reports coming in on the blackout and an update on the possible ground zero of those infected at Gornick Hospital. I'm going to now throw it to our remote reporter, Sarah Romero, who reports to us from the small farming community outside Gornick County. Sarah? [Sarah] Thank you, Sam. The situation here is worse than we could have imagined. One source who I spoke with, who did not want to be named, told me more than three dozen people from the Wesley Farms community have been affected by some sort of flesh-eating bacteria. The source told me that several people died here before they realized what was going on. Those admitted to the hospital are apparently in the early stages of the infection... Excuse me, sir, we're in the middle of a live feed... [static buzzes] [insects buzzing] [Sam] Um, we're apparently having some technical issues with our remote feed. Until we can get Sarah back let's return to Michael Adams at Gornick Hospital for an update. Michael? [Michael] Sam, this is going to be my last report from this location. Things have taken a bit of a turn and I've secluded myself with Judith Myers, one of the nurses on call in an office here on the fourth floor, awaiting police escort out of the building. I'm trying to make sense of what I'm about to report to you. According to Judith, several of those admitted to the hospital brutally attacked two doctors and several of the emergency room personnel. In an attempt to control the enraged patients, hospital staff members completely closed off all corridors leading to and from the area which is now concentrated with a horde of infected. Judith has told me the area of the hospital that we are stationed in is secure and away from those who seem to be unstable and hostile. They have apparently lost control of their bodily functions and what has been described to me as swiftly growing patches of rot are spreading across their bodies. I must warn you that what you're about to hear is graphic in nature. Judith, could you please tell me again what happened? [Judith] Sure. I've been a nurse for 15 years, and I've never seen anything like this. [camera clicking] We were treating a patient that seemed to be dying of suffocation and extremely aggressive skin deterioration. - It was so awful. - [banging] - [banging continues] - As we were trying to intubate the sedated patient, they suddenly went into seizures and their bones began to break on their own. Moments later, multiple boils formed on their arms and neck, and within seconds they were oozing and exploding with thick blood and pus. The patient rolled over onto their stomach and let out an ear-piercing scream as their spine pushed outward, tearing through the flesh of the back. At that point we fled the room. There were screams coming from all over the ward like that. It was deafening. [Michael] We've been informed that police are here but are having a difficult time making their way - past the entrance. - [grunting] [gasping] [panting] [wheezing] [panting] [intense music playing] [mutters] [Michael on radio] We've been informed that police are here but are having a difficult time making their way past the entrance. Hospital workers are barricading themselves in floors above us now. I think something's trying to come through the door. We need to barricade it. What is that? [Sam] Well, um, I'm... not exactly sure what just happened there. Uh... we seem to be getting an overwhelming amount of calls coming from panicked listeners reporting attacks in their areas. These calls are coming from several different counties in the Great Lakes area. I'm not exactly sure what to make of all this sudden rise in violence in our great state. There seems to be genuine fright in everyone's voice. As we continue our coverage of breaking news, we just heard from the mayor's office that a shelter in place order will go into effect as of midnight tonight. Fuck. [camera clicks] [camera clicks] [camera clicks] [camera clicks] Oh, shit. What the fuck... Oh... wow. Oh, shit. What do we have here? [gunshot in distance] [gunshots in distance] [doctor on radio] And we've succeeded in isolating the bacteria, and since that time we've been trying to find something to destroy, or even arrest, the bacterial processes. But, unfortunately, we have been unable to even stop this meiosis or reproductive process. It seems that these organisms, after destroying the brain cells, lock themselves in the bone marrow where each cell divides. This process continues quite rapidly and each cell can reproduce an equal in approximately 90 seconds. Of course, the body manufactures red blood cells in the bone marrow. Since the bacteria destroys the marrow, the body cannot produce...

I'm not sure how much longer I can check in, - but I'll do so until the end. - Oh, goddamn. The last 40 minutes have been a nightmare. - Fuck. - My camera operator, Renee, and I - had begun traveling along I-96... - [groans] Motherfucker. ...for roughly 30 minutes on our way to the Wesley Farms area when we came across a burning car on the side of the road. We pulled over to see if we could help. As we approached the burning vehicle, we heard an ear-piercing scream coming from the flames. Renee and I charged the vehicle, but the flames were so intense we had to retreat. The car was melting to the frame right in front of us. All we could do was watch helplessly as the flames engulfed it. And then, something happened... ...that I can't even explain, but one of the bodies appeared from the flames, it was charred and almost skeletal in form. It stumbled several feet away from the vehicle before collapsing. - [softly] Fuck. - We moved closer to the body and that's when we saw something so uncanny, it was like... something from a horror film. What we thought was the persons' arm broke off from their body and began to slither... [rock music playing on radio] [lyrics indistinct] [music stops] [exhales deeply] - [animal chittering] - [man grunting] Yeah, this will do. [man on radio] ...extremely fast spreading. It attacks all the major organs and mutates them. What would take a normal cell months to mutate are taking only minutes. The doctor seemed dazed, horrified, and somewhat in awe as he explained to me what he was witnessing, saying that this virus was almost alien-like.

I couldn't get through on the phone. It wasn't working. Everything was... - [sighs] - Is that? Ben, yes. Did you? I didn't have a choice. He... Oh, it was awful. He just... he just wasn't himself. There was something so wrong with him, Thomas. He just... [stammers] - Hey. - He came at me and... Hey, hey, hey, hey. I know. Hey... He has thing growin' out of his... I'm sorry I left you. I shouldn't have done that. I just... I just didn't know what else to do. It's okay. It's gonna be okay. [sighs] Your brother and the kids? I went to their house and they weren't there. Went to their work, nothing. Day care... no. - Hmm... - But I'm sure they managed to get out. Yeah. They're okay. I know it. Mom, we have to go. But... No. What if they come here and-and they're looking for us and if we're not here, they're not gonna know where we are. Avery's smart, okay? He's going to get them somewhere safe. I just need to know. [sighs] I know. Me, too. [intense music playing] [man groaning] It's time to go. Thomas. Thomas! Thomas! Thomas! I heard a report on the radio there's a safe station in Columbus. It's a five-hour drive. Avery probably took the family there. Okay. We need to make a stop first. [engine starts] [intense music sting] What is it? What? What? I thought I saw someone. [gasps] - Mom, no. - What? It could be Avery. It could be the kids. What if it isn't? - [sighs] - I'm gonna go check it out. Oh. [nervous laugh] Lock the doors until I get back. Okay. - [car beeping] - [sobs] Be careful. Avery? Avery, is that you? Avery? [door unlocks] [gasps] [grunts] Thomas? I don't know what that was... but it wasn't... Avery. [panting] [intense music playing] [vehicle approaching] [Vera] Honey, that's-that's Avery's car. That's Avery's car. Where are they? [Thomas] Check inside. [door closes] [Thomas] Avery? You in here? Avery? Where are you? Avery? Where is he? There is something wrong. I can feel it. Maybe he just left his car here and took the truck. Yeah. Maybe. [soft chuckle] So, what's all this stuff? Medical supplies, rations... [chuckles] Security. [gasps] Even if I told you I had all this stuff, you probably would think I was crazy or would get worried. - [intense music playing] - [girl snarling] I'm sorry we actually we have to use it. Well, I'm not. Let's get this stuff to the car. [girl snarling] [girl gurgling] [wheezing] [wheezing] [wheezing] - [hissing] - [clattering] Avery? Is that you? Avery, it's Mom. [snarling] [wheezing] No. No, hon, I can't do that. I... We don't have a choice anymore. [sighs] [gurgling] [girl panting] [screeching] [intense music playing] - Go! - Thomas! Thomas! Thomas! - [growling] - Thomas! [grunting, indistinct] Get to the car! [grunting] [Vera] Thomas! [screams] Thomas! Hurry up! - Get to the car! - [yelling indistinct] [growling] [man on radio] Is this on? Am I on? This is Doctor Madigan, speaking to you from the County General Hospital. [intense music playing] At this time, I regret to inform everyone that the emergency wing of our hospital has been completely barricaded for all of the patients and some of the hospital staff trapped inside, and I can't believe I'm saying this, after removing the remaining patients from other wards, we ordered the emergency ward to be set on fire. We had to burn it down. There was no other way. [muted dialogue] [Sam on radio] Since our last report, these items have been brought to our attention. There is a hotel in the heart of Downtown Gornick where three residents have flung themselves from the windows. One woman was seen bouncing along the brick walls on the way down after breaking through a window on the 13th floor. Identification of the victims are impossible because the bodies had been defiled by a small mob forming in the streets. Police say the situation seems to be under control... but I-I don't know, it doesn't seem like things are under control here. Right now communication between KLME News Radio and our remote reporters is extremely challenging. We realize there is a lot of misinformation circulating and creating a lot of panic. We need to try to remain calm and do our best to keep each other safe. There are numerous reports of food hoarding and gun fire in the eastern part of Gornick County. If you can shelter in place, law enforcement officials highly recommend locking your doors and staying inside or social distancing yourself - from others until further notice. - [Vera] What's going on? I'm just trying to see where we are. We've got another bit of breaking news from a doctor at County General Hospital. [snarling] [growling] - [horn honking] - [Vera and Thomas screaming] No! Thomas! [screaming] [Sam on radio] That was Ken Lasalle reporting from County General Hospital. Police have informed us that a section of 196 is now blocked off and they are trying to reroute traffic onto surface streets. The discovery of a man's body dangling from an overpass wearing only a crucifix has shut down the usually busy road in both directions. Unfortunately, the police say they are so overwhelmed with emergency calls right now, they have not had time to remove the man's body. One eye witness says that they saw the man jump to his death, shouting end of world comments. The eye witness also said that his body looked like it was rotted from the waist down. Some people have volunteered to remove or at least cover the body up, but police say that it is a crime scene until further notice and cannot be compromised until investigation... - [static buzzes] - [man on radio] We interrupt this signal to bring you a National Emergency Alert. This is not a test. We repeat. This is not a test. In compliance with state and local authorities we are urging residents at this time to take shelter. [alert signal] - Excuse me? - Don't you come near me! - You're in my garage. - Look, I can't be out there right now! You cannot be in here! This is a private property. You get the fuck out! No. I'm warning you! Or what?! Hey. All right. I don't know what kind of trouble you're in... but if you need help I can call the police. Have you been out there? Do you know what's going on? Of course, I know. [stammers] What the hell are they gonna do? It's out there killing our families. Our towns. No, no. We're on our own now. That does not give you the right to come into my space. [coughing] Is that blood? Yes. Is it yours? No. - Fuck! - No, no, no, no. Hey, hey. - It's not what you think. - You don't know what I'm thinking. Look, look, hey, hey. Hey, hey. Can I sit down for just a minute? Just-just a minute. Sir, you need to leave. I'm not gonna hurt you, okay? I just... I just need a minute to catch my breath, okay? Please. You have no idea what I've seen. Okay. Okay. Okay. Enlighten me. Are you bugging out, too? Finding my sister. She went camping a few weeks ago, and I haven't heard from her. I hate to tell you this but... if she's out in those woods, she's not coming back. [sighs] You don't know that. Lady, I don't know a lot of things, but I am damn sure about that. It's just a virus. If she stays away from people she'll be fine. No, no, no, no. No. It's-it's-it's way more than that, believe me. Wait... You've seen it? Yeah. Yeah, I've seen it. My wife and I came out here a few days ago looking for her sister and her sister's kid. She, um... she wanted to take him camping. I told her it wasn't a good idea. He's in a... he's in a wheelchair and-and she can barely get him around the city... let alone the goddamn woods. We... we drove around for days looking for them. Nothing. Eventually... we came across... a family on the side of the road. From the looks of it, they'd been infected. Strange shit growing from their skin. Look like a, um, like a fungus or... mold. Mold? When my wife saw the kids, she-she begged me to stop. I told her it wasn't a good idea. We-we-we don't fully understand what's going on. [stutters] No one understands what's going on. Or maybe they do and they're not telling us. [banging] They? Yeah. The government, the military. Who else? Oh, come on. No, no. [stuttering] Toxic space dust, an experiment gone wrong, blob from outer space, who the fuck knows. Look, th-th-this stuff grows faster than-than anything I've ever seen. It-it mutates the body. They're not people anymore. You're talking about this thing like it's a living, breathing monster. Yeah. That's exactly what it is. I told her that we should keep going. She didn't wanna listen. Kept begging me to stop. Wouldn't let it go. [breathes deeply] They were not children anymore. I didn't have a choice. That blood? Survival instinct kicks in, okay. Anyway... that's when we got separated. [growling in distance] It's getting closer. What's getting closer? Okay. We've gotta go now. We? I'm not going anywhere with you. Look, listen, my wife and I, we've heard of these places. Safe haven cities. Unaffected. If you're smart... Excuse me? If you're smart, you'll come with us. I'm not going to any of those places. If a single person who's infected gets in, that is a bomb waiting to go off. Okay. I don't think you understand the gravity... No, you don't understand. I worked hard for this place. It's isolated. I have food. I have water. I'm safer here. We are safer here. [laughs] Okay. You know what? And all these stuff, it's gonna last you, what, like a week, and then what? [banging on door] [snarling] What the hell was that? [muffled whimpering] Did you hear that? I didn't hear anything. I swear I heard a voice. Hello? - [muffled whimper] - Hello? Can you hear me? You're hearing things. [muffled screaming] I know you heard that? If you go out that door... What? I'm not letting you back in. Are you kidding me? That could be my wife out there. And it might not be. Okay. You know, I'm not gonna sit here and debate this with you. - I'm going out. - Suit yourself. I'm not risking my life on a what if. Fine. Maybe you can let people die. I can't. [door knob rattling] - [Israel] Hey. Hey, hey, it's me. - [knocking on door] Let us in. It's my wife. She needs help. Please. Come on. She could die. Don't do this! Please! Fuck! Hey. Hey. Hey. - [woman whimpering] - [Israel] No-no. I'm gonna get you help. It's gonna be okay. Lily, I-I-I promise. I promise. I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm gonna find you some a shelter, okay? - [Lily] We're gonna die. - [Israel] No, no... - [Lily] Everybody's dying. - No. No. We are not gonna die. - Okay, look... Don't say that. - [Lily sobbing] [Israel] We have... No, no. We have to keep going. [Lily] I can't, Israel. [Israel] It's okay. It's okay. - It's okay. Come on. - I need to lay down. On the table. [Israel] It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Okay. All right. There you go. - [Lily] I'm burning up. - Okay, okay, okay. - Do you want to lie down? - Here, let's lay you down. - Okay. - [groans] Not my back. [groans] [gasps] What the fuck is that? I don't know. - [Lily] What's going on? - Nothing. It's nothing. - That is not nothing. - It's fine! It's-it's fine. - [whimpers] I'm so sorry... - Hey. Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Look at me. - Look-look... - We shouldn't have stopped. - No, no, no, no. - [whimpers] We shouldn't have stopped. Hey, Lily. Lily, Lily. - I'm gonna take care of you. Okay? - [whimpering] Look-look... Hey, hey. Look at me. - I'm gonna get it out, okay? [stutters] - [whimpering] [wincing] No! I don't think you should do that. Look, I gotta get this fucking thing off of her. Trust me. [crying] [panting] - Lily, I'm sorry. - No. - I've got to do this. - No. Please, no. [groaning] What did you do? [Lily wheezing] Look, hey, hey, hey. No, no, no, stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me. What are you doing? - Checking her pulse. - What the fuck are you... I'm a medic. Okay. - Shh. - Her pulse is rapid. - Her skin is clammy. - Is she gonna be all right? - I... - Is she gonna be all right? - I can't... - [breathing heavily] Lily, hey, hey, hey, hey. Deep breath. Deep breath. - Shh. - [door rattling] Lily, slow your breathing down, okay? - [whimpering] - Slow it down. Shh. - Shit! - What? That sound. What about that sound? You don't want to know. [growling] [intense music playing] Okay, Lily, you need to breath, okay? You need to take, deep breaths, slow deep... Lily? Lily? Lily... Lily! [gasps] What's... What's that? - What the fuck is happening? - She's going into shock. What do we do? What do we do? [panting] - We need to stabilize her. - How? How? [panting] [intense music playing] [gasps] [whimpers] What the fuck is that? - [shuddering] - No. Don't. Don't. I have to. Do you though? Jesus. [shudders] [growling] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. She can't stay here. I'm not putting her out there. She'll infect us both. Then she does. I don't care. - You're not making that choice for me! - What do you want me to do? You want me to put her outside, let her die? You're a medic, you can help her. - I don't have... - You have to do something! [clattering] You get her out of here now. What are you gonna do with that? I don't owe you my life! Go! Please. [panting] [screaming] [panting] [growling] [panting] [gasping] [screams] [screeching] [hyperventilating] - [Israel screaming] - [shrieks] [growling] [mystical music playing] Vera? Serena? What the hell are you doing all the way up here? Thomas and I, we... I'm so sorry. Are you okay? [sobs] No. No, I'm not okay. Before I let you in, I need to know that you're okay. Oh. [chuckles] No, I'm fine. No, Serena, I'm fine. All right. All right. Get in. Get in. [woman on radio] Whatever this is attacking us does not discriminate. It consumes the body quickly and forms into some sort of creature. It then spreads its spore through secreting dark mucus or blood that when it comes into contact with humans, it completely alters their DNA. I've seen this with my own eyes. Don't listen to those trying to hide the truth. This is not a hoax. We are at war. We are going to need more than a vaccine to fight this. We need each other now more than ever. [rock music playing]
