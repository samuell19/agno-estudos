The Girl has nerve. She lives in a hotel room. She has no brothers, no sisters, no mother, no father. She sings in a night-club. The first time I ask her, she takes me home. She doesn't ask my name. I call her... Agnus Dei. Agnus Dei... qui tollis pecata mundi. Agnus Dei... who takes away the sins of the world. I don't usually do it with women. But there's something about you. It's like being with a beautiful young man. But it's just one night. After this... basta. I stay in the streets at night. I end up at the banks of the Seine. Where I stay part of the night waiting. I'm in the night club. I don't talk to her. Sometimes she gives me a glance. Sometimes she laughs at me between two songs. I don't ask her to take me home. She never tells me anything about the men she meets at night. She's tough with them. Lovely Agnus Dei. She hangs around too much. You're getting all kinds of attention. What's so extraordinary about her, after all? She's got that look in her eye. She doesn't have a chance. You gonna kick her to the curb like everyone else? Bien sur. Make me with your clothes on. Just what I need, an artist. I won't have a minute to breathe. It will be all the time... in bed... when I get dressed, when I put on my makeup. You must take yourself for a Van Gogh... maybe Picasso... and you want me to model for free. As though I owe it to genius. Okay. It's time for you to go now. I thought you wanted me to stay. Enough of your drawing... and of you. Go fuck yourself. You don't know me yet. Why is Agnus Dei so secure and confident? She says she'll never need a gun or a knife. Her tongue is enough... and the look in her eyes. Start with a concrete figure, and arrive at an abstraction... with no corrections possible. The girl gives me a name. She calls me Lover. Remember the lovely sweet time we had together? Remember the violet tiaras and the braided roses... and the saffron you used to wear? Remember the meadows of daffodils... and how lightly you tread on them? How you talk. Tell me those words that no one has ever told me. Gentle... gentle, Lover. Enough, hands off, understood? She uses her nakedness as an Armour. The night is hers. The city is hers. And to think I want men so much. But you're like... one of those heroes from some old romance. What do you know about real life? She never asks about my life. She doesn't know anything about me. When I'm not with her I stop existing altogether for her. If need be she would say I'm a painter. 'Who cares' and 'why not' are her favourite expressions. She's right. Who cares. I can't help it, my love. Violent delights have violent ends. This isn't the first time for us and it won't be the last. I saw you from the window. Would you believe that this time I'm looking for you? You better hurry. You're not fast enough. Bath is ready. Lock the door. Some people get dressed to socialize, others get undressed Let me guess which you prefer. Take off your clothes. Each time we see each other you act as though if it's the last time. Strange since I'm the one who wants it to be last time. You walk in. Plan to stay. I'm all yours. Walk away. I'm spinning round and round in games and mysteries. I'm an artist, you know. I've played parts in movies and TV shows. That's the first step to a big role in an important movie by a famous director. I have relationships with a lot of people... who are going to help me out with my career. That's the way it's done. Friends give you a hand with your work. Friends? Yes. You go to bed with them like you go out to bars with them. So that's the way it's done? That's the way. She isn't my type. Who said, I've wasted years of my life... for a woman who wasn't even my type? We do what we do. Don't we? Must be fascinating to be attracted... to someone who doesn't attract you. The idea that I could be a failure as a painter doesn't occur to Bu Save. There's nothing judgmental about her. She understands the slow process of work and its disappointing phases. Her presence and her absence are everything to me. I love dancing... with men and women. I love dancing all alone just as much. What do you think, painter? Why don't you leave me alone? I have to fight with men everyday. I'm not going to do that with you. I don't want you to come home with me. Didn't you hear? I don't want to see anybody. And don't wait for me either. Make yourself scarce. Understand? Her room has the silver light of the afternoon... that comes with the paleness of the sky. The leaves of the plain trees are seen inside out in a translucent green. The curtains bring up the memory of snow. Soon she and I are pulled out of the room... and into an unadorned, open deserted space. Bu Save is never home anymore. There is no way to know when she was here last. He's putting the pressure on. I can't trust him. Is there anyone who can? Where's the painter? I haven't seen her in a long time. I know I have a bad character. I know that I'm not good... and that I'm illogical. But you seem to understand me. You never get mad at me. The day after there's no hurry. The hum of traffic sounds far away. There's a bright light behind the white curtains. The sheets are soaked vivid with her perfume. I learn that if I look enough, if I fumble long enough... a form will slowly develop. I could make a few sketches if you let me. But I won't. I want to draw you. Well... maybe I'll let you... but under one condition. And what would that be? I have an idea. Whatever it is... no. You can look now. You're rather pretty as a girl. Is this what you really like? I told you I'm not turned on by girls who look like boys. One day I'll ban you from my bed. Will you? Yes... because this is how I want you. I wanted to see how it feels. I've met you already. Your face is familiar. Maybe I remind you of someone. That's it. You remind me very much of someone. I hope it's a good memory. It is. Do you see him? He's the one that's watching us. He's watching you. He can't watch me without seeing you too. Why did you bring me here? Because I want you to know about him. He's a dangerous man... and he's a clever man. It's time you found out. It would be unfair to go on like this. If he pushes me so much it might be because you're watching him. You're not up to him. You must know that. It's already gone too far. Who cares? I may care... a little. That's new. It doesn't sound like anything you've written before. Does that mean you like it? Very much. I'm not working well. You should say not working at all. Just keep working. I will. All these flowers give me the chills. It looks like a funeral home. There are more than enough for a still life... very still. And I don't do still life. If at least they were flowers that I like. Red poppies or blue cornflowers. But no chance. What's wrong? Nothing. Help me with this, will you?! You look pale. Five minutes to show time! Wait for me after the show. Take them back. Leave me alone, okay! Bar's closed. It's getting late. It won't happen again. Forget it. Let's get out of here. A man will never say to his girlfriend that he enjoys fucking men. That's the worst thing he could admit. But... when they're with me... they pretend to be doing it with a man. They call me men's names. I know what nobody else knows. That's what I have over them. That's why they come back. I know they do. I skip a lot of classes now. I haven't touched a brush or a pencil on my own in a long time. but I still come to the morning class. The night is slow to come. I don't go to the nightclub very often anymore. She tells me to stay away. But sometimes I stand outside to watch over her. My last song went all wrong. And the pianist slowed down. There were important people there tonight. You were the most important. Because all you see is me. You only see women. And you only see men. Fucking is damned good. What do you say Lover? But it won't last. I warn you. No, sir. No, Lover... not if you persist in your attitude. You prissy, pricky little cock. If I am not good enough for you... if I am not clever enough, then forget it. What's good enough for them is good enough for you. I'll show you, Lover, what I do every night... and you'll like it. But first come. Look at me... come. What is it? What? It says... 'Get rid of her now or someone else will.' You know what I do when someone tries to force me to do something? You don't do it. I don't do it. So, I'm keeping you... at any cost. Now they'll see what I'm made of. I'm in trouble. I'm here to keep you out of trouble. Can you do that? You know I can. For how long? For only as long as you want me to. A kir. What do you think you're doing?! Get the hell out of here! I can fuck whoever I want to! Now do you understand? I don't want you to be mixed up in all this. I don't want you to know more. Now I'm scared. Is it the morning after? Are the leaves behind the window a very tender green? Does she tell me that she can't go on without me? Do I hold her so tight that no one... not even that man... can ever tear her from my arms? I look for Bu Save in the places she and I spend time. Who's that? I'd like to know. They took my gun. He thinks he owns everyone... and he wants to make sure you know that. Does he own everyone? He doesn't own me. I'm here to keep you out of trouble, remember? Sing a song for me. I can't. Here's something for you, Lover... But you won't like it. It's very nasty. This time you'll pay. Well... here we are. I'm the one who's going to get it. I'm the one who'll pay. Night after night, bar after bar... I keep following him. Bu Save? Bu Save? Is it loaded? Here... be careful. Is she in? She left a few hours ago. Was she alone? I said, was she alone? We respect our guest's privacy. As you are aware. - I need to know. I really didn't pay attention. Have you seen her? - No. A drink? - Thanks. I think she left town with the boss. Boss? - You didn't know? He owns the place... and everyone in it. What if she's gone for good? Lover. Come in. Look what I have for us. You'll like this. Here. You may need this. Thank you, Lover. You don't know what I went through. Forget it. You don't need to know. What can I do? Stay with me. Lover, why don't get us something to drink... and come back later? And watch for me at my window. Will you do that, Lover? Then it will be just the two of us. I go to the girl's place as usual. I don't ask any questions. She doesn't mention the night before. Have some foie-gras, Lover. Or would you prefer caviar? Anyway, you must taste this wine. It's superb. What's the matter with you, Lover? I'm going to take you on a cruise. On a boat going very far away. I don't know where, maybe... maybe the Bahamas. I can't stay. Lover... why don't you take me into your arms? Talk to me. I have to go. I walk I walk. Hours pass... maybe days. There are no birds. There's no sun. There's no light. There are no clouds. Agnus Dei? Agnus Dei? Did he hurt you, Lover?
