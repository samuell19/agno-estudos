Nardo! Why didn't you tell me there's a canal? You didn't ask me. Hop in! Hurry! Let's go! - Nardo! - Hey! How rude you are to pee on me! And now you're laughing? Hey! Bring it back! Bring it back to me! Hey! Move backward! Hurry! Move here! Hold on tight! Let me go! Hey! Go back! You're an asshole! It fell! Move backward! Let's go! Nardo! There! Nardo! It's broken. - No! - Stop! Let go of me! Hey! Wait! Ouch! Too damn lazy! It's too early yet you're already dreaming! Stand up! Stand up! - You deserve it! - You! - What? - I will kick your ass! - Move! - Nardo, stop! Ouch! Hey, Nardo! Enough! Nardo, stop! Move away! Enough! Wake up! Nardo! Nardo! What happened? All you do is sleep! I'm so exhausted. You're dreaming. You even punched Mr. Yu. - And me! - Where's Mr. Yu? Damn you. Sir, is that the trend nowadays? What do you think of me? - Sir! - Smells like rotten? Sir! Don't be too angry. That's a bad example to your employees. So I'm the bad example now? Huh? I will kill that lazy janitor! - No! - Fire him! No! Don't be too harsh on Nardo. Let's just talk about your employees. The system of accounts are usually imbalanced because of the losses. Someone is stealing it! You're being irresponsible! The books aren't organized, too! Mr. Luna. I think you're referring to my assistant. Friend. Am I referring to someone? No one. Good! Very good! You must fire your secretary! - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Please. - Take this back to the rest room. - Okay. All she does here is to put her makeup and expose her body. Mr. Luna. My secretary, Ms. Kipapano, is a fine woman. She's just misunderstood. She's very conservative. Ms. Kipapano? Yes, darling? Mr. Luna! Would you like coffee, tea, or milk? No, thank you. Your secretary is indeed conservative. She's a very fine woman. Yes, I told you. - Okay. - Okay. Luna is having doubts. He's suspecting about our relationship. He may also find out the failing status of our partnership. If that happens, all anomalies in this company will be exposed. That's why I think that there is no other way but to kill Luna. Sir. Thank you for defending me against Mr. Yu. Thank you very much. Have a seat. Thanks. You, kid! Never sleep during working hours! Damn that Mr. Yu. I didn't sleep while on duty. I slept on the sofa. Oh! Look at your craziness! I'm just kidding. What do you want? Coffee? Tea? Milk? Or I'll beat you up? Oh, sir. Sit here. I'm sorry, I forgot it. Goodness. Whenever I'm talking to you, I am always sweaty. Oh, yes sir. I'm sorry. Sir, do you want coffee? - Sir? - Damn that coffee! Myla. My love. This is for you. Thank you. You're so sweet. - I'll put it here. - Thank you, too. - What are you doing? - Nothing. I'm going to transfer this to boss's office. Leave it to me. You know that whenever I help you, it makes me happy. Okay. - You're insisting. - By the way. Myla, this is about Mr. Yu. Why? Don't trust that bald man too much. He's a playboy. When he was a child, he's really into girls. That's why he lost his hair. He can't stop combing whenever he sees a girl. That's true. This is just a secret. You know. He used to victimized four secretaries already. If ever, you're the fifth one! - What? - And you're the sixth one! Oh! Sir! Myla wants you to have this. Nardo! Whatever! Why do you believe that fool? That's not true! It's just three. - Go! - Attack him! - Yes! - Attack now! Who do you think you are? You're even nodding, huh? Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Bury him! Punch him there! Crush Totoy Bato! Punch him! There! There! You deserve it. idiot! Asshole! - Mom? - Damn! Help me out! You asshole! You beat my mother! Ouch! The two of you! You never learn, huh? Huh? I'm gonna kick you! Horsey! Knock down. Knock down. Only two strikes and he's knocked down. You're too strong, dude. Mom! Stop it, mom! Why are you fighting with Bruno and Damaso? Why not? They doubled the payment for the condominium because of the rental law! Those house rental owners are really abusive. They think they can fool me? They just added some roof, and the rental fee will also increase. - What else? - Some materials are added, and the payment will increase again. They just repaired the last part, and that costs a lot already. They'll also add something here, - but it's nearly broken. - I don't know with them. Give me some ice. It's partly your fault, mom. You went outside, and you argued with those gorillas. What if you have an attack again? You must be courageous! If you know you're right, fight for it! She's not mad now. I think she still is. She's not. The problem is, you're such a coward! Why don't you be like me? I'm not afraid of anything! Ouch! Why? Blood! Let's put some of this. Don't! - Let's just put some of this. -I don't like that! You told me you're brave. It's just an alcohol yet you're scared. This alcohol is fine, mom. It's not only for family, but for wounds. Enough with the non sense. Is that going to take long, mom? Maybe it will take- - Maybe about three hours. - Gosh! - But mom. - It's very hot. I'm gonna be late. I'm going to class. Oh! Mom! It fell. It wants to join me. Put it back before you leave. Mom, I'm gonna be late. Who do you want to fix that? Me? Okay, okay. Go on and hurry up. You're too slow to move. What the hell? Take it easy! Okay. My goodness! Mom. Damn this house. The cockroaches just crossed and it already fell. Mom! Mom! What are you doing there? Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Hey, we're already late! Goodness. Even your laughs are the same. Why are you trying to be twins? Well. My mom and my dad want to have twin children. but it didnâ€™t happen. So they want us to act like one. Hey! You twins from the province! What the hell is up with you? You haven't paid your house rental for two months! When will you pay me? Ms. Barbaro. Barbara! Ms. Barbara. Can we pay next week? No! You can't! You can't! I told you it cannot be! How about next week? Sure, next month. Next year! This thing is called animal attraction. It's an inherent quality in man. Now, this is constantly manifested by its constant desire to attract the opposite sex. So. For our exercise this morning, you will try to attract the attention of others. Now. You can use one of the devices if you can wink an eye. - Sir! - Yes? That doesn't work for me. Why? I have two black eyes. Sit down! Right now! That's funny, Nardo. So. You will now try to attract the attention of the seatmate on your left. Starting right now. What the hell? - Aren't you going to stop? - He said left! That's my girlfriend! You're annoying!

Where are you going? Sir. Sir? Sir. Looks like you're about to go home early. I'm not feeling well so I'll just read these contracts at home. Where do you go home? - At the house as well. - I know! What I meant to say was where location is it? You'll pass there. Okay, hop in my car. No but thanks, sir. I feel very shy. Okay, start the car. Do you know how to drive? Yes, sir.

We just turned around! Ouch! Ouch! I owe you my life. It's my mission. You know what, sir? Maybe you should have a vacation. You're stressed lately. Maybe- That is true. I'm going to die immediately with what Mr. Yu is doing to me, as well as his secretary. What do you mean? Nothing. Nothing. Hey! Why do you have an oxygen? - Can't you breathe as well? - This one? - Yes. -No, I'm not. Why are you zipping it? Asshole! That's a soda! Change mine as well! This is the glue. Give it to Mr. Torres and tell him to make more of this. - Okay. - Make it faster. - Myla. - Hi. Do you have plans? Nothing, I'll just stay here. Myla, my love. Hi. Are you busy? Yes. I'll bring this to Mr. Yu and to his bodyguard. Do they have milk? Where are you staring at? What do you mean milk? I'm asking if the two of them have milk. If they have more milk, I will mix it for you. You can count on me! Make it clear next time. - You want to blend it? - Yes. That's better. - I'll just make a call. - Okay. - Excuse me. - Go and make a call. Okay. My love. What the hell are you looking at? I'm just looking at the- If your milk is already mixed.

Don't you have work? I got fired. Why? I just went inside the rest room and got fired. You just went inside the rest room, and you got fired already? They're too much! It's the ladies rest room. You're an asshole! - Mom! - Why? Why did you go inside the rest room? Stop saying it's the rest room. How? What happened? I got fired because I went inside the ladies room. My boss's mistress is in there. And I accidentally pissed off Mr. Yu. What happened? I'm having an asthma attack. Buy now! Give me that. Stop broadcasting your cough. Looks like you're presenting your own asthma. I'm really having an attack. Buy now, friends! I'll sell these catfish, you should go home. Okay. Catfish, ma'am. Ma'am. Catfish! My friends!

Legs again? Too many legs, my friends! All legs! Hey! Hey. - Nardo. - Sandra. Hi. - Why are you here? - Hi! Why are you here? You bought something? No. I just assisted my sister. My older sister Jessica. This is Nardo. Hi, Nardo. Goodness! My name is Jessica, not goodness. Oh, Jessica. Hey, my hand. Huh? My hand. I'm sorry. Jessica is a reporter. We just assisted her here to write her upcoming article about the experiences of vendors here in the market. So, we told her that we know your mother. My mom just left. She's not feeling well. If you want to, just come to our house. Sure, maybe tomorrow. Aren't you going to interview me? About what? Here. About the catfish. Nardo, I'm going to tell you something. It smells bad! Get the fish! Help me! Guard! Ouch. My mom will get mad! I haven't sell anything. Step on it! There! I got you! I got you! - Wait. - Wait. Don't squeeze it! Don't touch it! I might lose it. - That's my penis! - Oh! That's why the head's texture is different. You squeezed and crushed it! My catfish! Fifty thousand pesos. Down payment if you murder Mr. Luna. Mr. Yu. If you don't do your job, you'll end up in the smokey mountain! You don't trust me. Let's forget about it. Wait. If he doesn't want to- Me. I'll do it. Did I say you? Enough! Don't forget that we need to get the documents first, before you can kill Luna. Because- He can no longer speak when he's dead. When are we going to kill him? After office hours on Monday. Dude! Come! - Why? - A chic is coming. She's beautiful! Very sexy! Damn! Hey! She's as white as radish! It's hard to finish that. - Hi, sweetheart! - Hi, Nardo! - Where have you been? - Did you hear that? - He said sweetheart. - Yes. Come in. Thank God and you're all mine today. Mom is not yet here. You're too silly. Do we have something to do while waiting? Let's stay here so there will be no nuisances. - Goodness. - Oh! Why are you sweaty? It's because of those things. Help me here. I'm not used to this. I'm good even when I'm sitting. Oh? Even while sitting? While sitting? What you're going to do first is to mix it. So once it's being cooked, it will be hard. Mixing? Mix it slowly. Don't be too fast! Like this? Yes! Okay, this is done. You take it off. I can't see anything. - You first. - Never mind. I'll just listen to it. Okay. Let's take it off! Oh! Wait! Let's slowly take it off, so it'll be more exciting! Exciting? And then? Put some oil on it. So the eggs and eggplant won't stick. - He's maybe a virgin. - Definitely. There! Warm it up. We'll warm it up? Okay. There! Oh, this one? Do you eat it? Oh! I don't eat that. Try it! It's so hard! Of course! Okay, okay. That's delicious. How can I eat this? Swallow it. Okay? Now suck it. Take it slow. You might get shocked and get choked! - It's good, huh? - Of course! But. It's too slimy! Of course! You don't want it? Sit down there and I'll cook this. There! Okay. One more. Hey! Come! Ass. It's hairy! Ass, huh? It's hairy! Why? Ass? Hairy? That's a dog's ass! Looks like you had fun there. Too early for that. Oh, yes. I'm not used to this, so I feel exhausted. You should've let me teach you. Why? Are you a cook before? Of course! I do it every time in the kitchen! Mom! Mom! Your soon to be daughter-in-law is inside. She's inside. Come. Your daughter-in-law is good! Mom. She's the reporter I was talking about. She's Jessica. Good afternoon, Mrs. Karing. Good afternoon to you, too. I'm sorry, huh? I am not feeling well today. My chest hurts. - Wait, I'll just get something. - Mom. Do you want to see a doctor? No, no. You're always exhausting yourself. I told you not to worry about me. This is nothing. - I'm sorry, dear. - Don't worry? You're having an asthma attack again. I told you not to worry about it. I'm sorry, Jessica. She's really not feeling well. Can we do it some other time? Mom? Mom? Mom! Mrs. Karing? Mrs. Karing? Mrs. Karing. Take it slow! Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! - Taxi! - Taxi! - Taxi! - Stop! Taxi! Mrs. Karing? Mrs. Karing? Go to the other side of the road! - Mom? - Wait. There's a car. I'll talk to the driver. He might help us. - Hurry up! - Yes! Mom? Mom? Sir! Please help us. We need to take her to the hospital. - Huh? - This is an emergency! It's not working, I'm still fixing it. I'm sorry, miss. Mom. Mom. Boss! I beg you, please help us. - It's not working. - This is an emergency. - I can't do anything. - Have mercy! Nardo, your mom is on the truck! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Mom! Sir! Wait! Sir! Hey! Hey! Mrs. Karing! My mom! Mrs. Karing! Mrs. Karing! Hey! Sir! - What are you doing? - Hey! Look at where you're going! Wait! Wait! Hey! - Hey! - Nardo, hurry! Sir! Hey! Mrs. Karing! Mom! Mom! Mom! Wait! Hurry up, Nardo! Hurry! Mom! Mrs. Karing! Sir! Mom! Sir, wait! Stop! Let's go! - There's a taxi! - Hurry! Sir! This is an emergency! Hurry! Faster, Jessica! Let's go. Let's go. Sir, hurry up! Let's go to the nearest hospital! Faster! Mom! Mom! Oh! Why did you stop? What the hell? Hurry up! You said hospital! There! - It's the hospital! - That's it? Your mother has a rheumatic heart disease. Her heart is not internally open. That's why the blood circulation is not right. It just goes back to where it came from. She needs an immediate cardiac operation. If not, in just a short period of time, - she may- - Die? Doc? Do anything you can. She needs to be operated immediately. Is there any other way to save her? I'm sad to say this. You'll be needing a huge amount of money. How much is that, doctor? One hundred thousand pesos. One hundred thousand pesos? Yes. Is it obvious that this is wood? Never mind. This is the right time. Stanley. You'll handle the guards. Yes, sir! - Anton. - Nice! Handle the customers. - Okay. - While I will handle the manager and teller. Is it okay? Nardo. Are we really going to rob the bank? Yes! Of course, what are friends for? Remember. Stanley! - Handle the guards. - Police! - Anton! - Police! To the customers. I'll handle the manager. Let's go! Where are they? Sir! Why? Is there a coup d'etat? Get away. Get away! Okay, there! Over there! Bow down! Bow down! If your heads get up, I'll shoot you! Come on! Nobody will follow! Ouch! This is Sergeant Jocring! Surrender now! - I'm a cop! - Me, too! I'm a captain! Sir, I shot him! - I did that! - I did! I shot him! - There, he's running! - Let's chase him! Let's chase him! Oh God! It exploded! The tank exploded! It exploded! I pity Luna. This is his last day. Tomorrow, I'll be the owner of this company. Sir! Nardo? - Thank you! - Where have you been? I've been looking for you! That's why I came here. I'd like to ask for an advice. What advice? Here. Gosh! Nardo! - Where did you steal this? - I didn't still this. Why do you have it? The robbers threw it to me. - Why didn't you give it back? - I'm about to do that. But the cops almost shot me. They thought I'm with the robbers. Help me. The cops are chasing me. Don't you smell anything, Nardo? Nothing. It smells like war in here. Yes. I've been battling this one since morning. Excuse me, sir. This boy is rude. Hello? Hello? Hello? Put your hands up! What's the meaning of this? If you don't want to die, follow whatever I'll say. Mr. Yu. Why aren't you speaking? Open the drawer. Open it! Yes! Yes! There! Sit down! - Hurry up! - Okay. - Hurry up! - Okay. Don't let him escape. If he fights back, - shoot him! - Oh gosh! Mr. Jocring, I know him. He's not a bad man. I'm going to talk to him. Mind your own business! The three of you! Run over there! Yes, sir. Bulldog, there are cops! There are cops outside! How did that happen? - Huh? - I don't know. Someone might called the cops. Let's go! Mr. Luna? Sir? Sir? Damn! Is that what you called a good guy? But sir! Let's shoot him, sir. I'll go there myself! No! Why did you shoot him? You know there are cops coming! You told me to kill him, right? What kill? Why did you hurt him? We're gonna get in trouble! Is that so? Please don't! There! Let's go! Hurry! Mr. Luna! Mr. Luna, what happened? Who are those men? - I will take you to the hospital! - You don't have to. Get all the documents. Hide them. Don't give it to anyone. Nardo! Surrender now! You are being surrounded by cops! Let's attack him! - Yes, sir. - Okay, good. Hurry. Hurry up! Shoot Nardo! I'll go first! Wait! Don't let him escape, - or else we'll be in trouble! - Chase him! Chase him! Bulldog! Let's go. Let's get in. Officer! Over here! Here. Here. - There? - Over here. What happened? It's good that you came! Yes! If you didn't, Nardo might have killed us by now. - Yes! - What? You meant to say that Nardo shot him? - Yes! - He even stole things from our office! Look at what that asshole did to us! You! Untie me! Hurry! Hurry! - You know, sir. - Me, too! I will give reward just to have Nardo arrested. Damn it! We're together but you're pointing at me. Point it down! Why did you attack me? We're partners! Asshole! You hit my head! I'm not! It's because I followed this toilet paper that is attached to the person we're chasing. There! Behind you! It's still attached! You're fooling me! No, Boy! Whoever you are, surrender now! Let's go here! Sir! What are we waiting for? What are we waiting for? Huh? Wear your pants first! My crotch! - Sergeant Jocring? - Oh? Nardo is my friend. Maybe I can convince him to surrender. What? Don't! You might get killed! I can handle it. - Nardo? - Hush. Keep quiet. Nardo, surrender now. Right now? Mr. Yu already talked to the police. I know the lies of that person. I'm right here. I know the truth. You know the truth. But I only have one witness. It's Mr. Luna. Jessica, remember this. A dead person can no longer speak. - Come on! - Wait! What the hell are you doing, Nardo? Follow whatever I say! Don't go near us! If you don't let me escape, I will kill this woman! Hurry! You can't solve a problem with another problem! Stop it! Let's go there. Open the door! Hurry! You only made your case worse. Think about it, Nardo. Surrender now! Surrender? Am I a fool? You don't even believe that I'm not part of that robbery, and the killing of Mr. Luna. I'm sure the cops won't believe it. Let's say you did no wrong, Nardo. But how long will you hide from cops to prove that you're innocent? Until I haven't seen my mother cured. Let's say your mom is already cured. But do you think she'll be happy once she knows you're in jail? I pity your mother. I don't care if I get in jail. Nardo! Why did you leave me? You don't want to listen! What are you doing here? Hey! Nardo. Your mother. Huh? Why? What happened to my mom? Mom? Mom. Mom? Son. You will finally undergo operation. You'll be healed. We have money now. You'll be fine, mom. Mom. We have money now, mom. Here. Mom? You'll be healed, mom. You'll be operated. You'll come home. You'll sell again. And I'll go to school, right? Mom! Doc! This is what you need, right? Why don't you operate her now? What? Why are you just standing there? Mom. Mom! Mom! You're not going to die, mom! Mom! You'll be fine! We have money now! You'll undergo operation, mom! Don't leave me. Don't leave me. Doc? This is what you need, right? This is what you need, right? This is what you need, right? Why didn't you start the operation? You're afraid I'll not pay you? Nardo! Nardo! Wait! You're afraid, huh? Nardo! The only important thing for you is money! Here's the money! Money is more important for you instead of my mother's life! Mom! Don't leave me, mom. Mom. We did our best. But her life was only until there. Nardo. Nardo, you just don't know. Even without money, they would still operate your mom. Mom! Mom! Dude. Look at this. Look! Nardo is wanted? And there's a reward for someone who can find him and arrest him? Wow. Oh, it's true. Let me see. - I know. - Give me that. Let me read, that's mine. Now that mom is gone, I'll go back to the province. The money was returned to the bank. And it has been proven that you're not one of the robbers. But they still blame you on Mr. Luna's murder case. The cops must capture the real criminals. If you're going to hide, you only proved that you killed him. You know what? Just surrender. The life in jail is awesome. Free home, free food. Most importantly, you have guards. You're out of your mind! I'll be back here if I can finally face them. Did you hear that? He's going to hide. We'll follow him wherever he goes. Jessica. Take care of the documents. Hide them. Because that's the root of this. They'll have a hard time finding it. I hid it inside Coralyn. Coralyn? Who's Coralyn? Stop asking me. Let's fuck them up! The girls? Not them! Damn you! You never use your brain. If we attack them, we'll only get in trouble! - There are many witnesses! - Yes, I see. Sister? Are you reading the news today? Yes. Goodness! You can't read anything aside from murders, or teens who are high in drugs. A robbed bank, a guy shot in the head and exploded! Nuns who are raped! That's true, son. I just pity those kids who sell newspapers so I bought one. Never in my life, sister, that I read newspapers. Stop! Stop! Stop! There. Let's go! Let's follow him! Boy? The top is yours. The bottom is mine. Bulldog. You think you can talk to her? Yeah, right. Oh! The bottom is yours, the top is mine. How amazing! If she gets pregnant, Cesarean! So you'll pay for her bill. Hey! Where are you going? We're going back where we came from. You assholes! You also want to harm my girl? Sorry, sir. Let's just stay up here. Let them stay down there. The people you called are here. Let them come near. Come here! Good morning. Come here, son. Let's talk here. - Over there? - Here. Come. Go, get down here! Oh. Love. Explain it to them. Uhm. As Nardo's classmate, I need you to do something. That's easy, as long as there's cash. Cash? You have no problem. I want you to spy on whatever Nardo's friends are doing. You. Wait. Not there. There's a snake there. Python? Yes! A python! Short python! Not there! Snake! Someone is screaming! Snake! Snake! Where am I? Why am I here? You're in a safe place, son. What happened? Who are you? I'm Lakay Agimato. Agimato? I brought you here because I pity you. You pity me? - Yes. - Why? I pity those who are cowards, just like you. Those who are afraid of facing their mistakes in life. What do you mean? Son. Being a coward isn't good. But. Being too brave isn't good either. Especially when you use it to the powerless. The people who are called brave because they kill people. The true bravery is the bravery to face all the challenges in life. Sir. You sound like you know me so well. I know you very well. Because I've been waiting for you so long. Waiting? Yes. Because. You're the only one I should give this to. Huh? Toothpick? We haven't eaten yet and you're giving me this? That's an amulet. Amulet? You meant to say, you're the one who gave amulets to Ramon Revilla? Pepeng Agimat? And Nardong Putik? So you also eat guns? That was my relative. I'm sorry. Thank you, Mr. Aginomoto. Agimato. Are you from Cagayan? - That's Aguinaldo! - Oh. Sorry. Oh. Toothpick? What's the use of this? You'll find out tomorrow. Tomorrow? Why did you choose me for this? It's written here. The person who must own this. is you. Me? What is the real power of that toothpick? You didn't tell me last night. If you wear it, and swallow it by your mouth, you'll have great strength and bravery. Strength and bravery? Wow. This is cool. Pull that. Pull that! This one? Oh, sir. I can't even pull the little one, what more if it has huge roots? As huge as your roots. Pull that. Okay, I will. This one? Yes. I can't do this. You can. Okay. You made me eat too much camote last night. So there. Swallow the toothpick! Okay. It's true! I can now take revenge to my enemies! Son. You can only use that for good. It has lots of powers, too. Power? Multiple powers? You meant to say, I can now reach America, Iraq, Kuwait, Jordan. And wherever I want to? Power, not a visa. - Oh. - Come. - Follow me. - Toothpick. Hey. Look. Another power of that amulet, is the power for you to walk and float on water. Huh? Huh? Here? - Walking on water? - Yes. Okay, try it. Okay. - Oh! Toothpick. - Wait. I don't know how to swim. Don't you have any amulet for fish? Don't worry. That amulet came from a unique fish bone. That's why it tastes like sardines. Okay. - I'll walk now. - Go on. Wow! He's walking on water! He's walking on water! You're right! You're right, sir! Come on! Let's dance! We can do lambada here! Silly boy! You're too silly! This is a better reward if we can get that toothpick. Hey there. Swim! - Help! - Swim! Thank you, Mr. Agimato. If you're not here, maybe I'm dead. Where's the exit here? There. That's the nearest way to the city. Okay, thank you. Thank you again- Mr. Agimato? Sir?

Thank you, mister. Sir? Nardo. Nardong Toothpick. Oh. Help! Hey! You assholes! My face isn't a sink! You shocked us! Do you want your asses to be rotten? You crocodiles and horses! I need water, assholes! I thought you're Nardong Putik. Nardong Putik? You turned me into Nardong Toothpaste! You assholes! Looking good today, huh? You're like the one with an amulet! The one with an amulet! Like Ramon! - Ramon? - What's this? Don't touch it! It's not yours. Come on. Find us some frogs. We need it for our class. Yes! The edible one. Not the rocky one. All frogs are edible. - Yes! - Right! Ouch! Whatever. For every frog that we catch, you'll pay us with a kiss. Okay. Why don't we attack him? So we can finally get what he's hiding. Idiot! You can see that there's a lot of people. Let's surprise him. What if we didn't get it? Let's just kill him. Jessica. Did you know that you have a huge- Frog! Frog! Frog! The toothpick! Me, too! Anton! I got it! Don't move! What are you doing? You perverts! That's my private part! Sorry, I thought it was the frog. - Why is it salty? - That's normal.

Or else, I'll drown you in pee! - What? - I'll tell you! He'll tell us now. Het got the bullets? Gunshots! We might get involved! He's dead! Nardo? Nardo? Nardo. Nardo! - Nardo? - Nardo? We need to take you to the hospital. No. Nardo. I won't last anymore. The person who did this to you is heartless. Who? Nardo. What's your sin to them, Nardo? Jessica. Nardo? Hug me tight. I love you so much. You're not going to die, Nardo. Of course not. Especially now that you said you love me. Kiss. Ouch! Ouch, Jessica! That's why it smells like paint! Jessica, wait! One who always gets colds. And one who looks like lizard! That's what happened to you? I'm so fed up with your excuses! But Mr. Yu, the truth is- That kid has an amulet! He's demonic! For me, what's more important than the documents, is the amulet of Nardo! We need to get that! Enough with your insanity! Toothpick. The one thing against that is a hard jaw. Let go of me! Albert! What's the meaning of this? What do you want? Why do you have to involve her? Anton! Why? Where's Nardo? - I don't know! - You don't know? I don't! Where the hell is he? I said I don't know!

We don't need you here! Stop it! Leave now, Nardo! We don't need you here! What? You kicked out Nardo? You did that to your friend? I was just angry. So now, I am regretful. Not only regret will happen to us if Nardo dies. Your conscience will kill you! Oh. You're such an idiot! - Damn you! - Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Aren't you going to stop? Damn you! Damn you! Damn you! What the hell? Why are you hurting Anton? It's his fault. He fought and kicked out Nardo! He kicked him out? You're such an asshole! Ouch! Stop it, madame! Enough with your non sense deeds!
