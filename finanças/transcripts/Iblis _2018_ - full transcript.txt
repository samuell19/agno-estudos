Should I laugh at a house where a death has happened? Grandpa, where do dead people live? Some say that there's heaven and hell after death. We'll have to see once we're dead. What's the guarantee that the person who died today, is not walking with us nomf? 'As they reached this shore, stealing a treasure' 'As they were speaking, the next crook also fell down, trembling to death. Oh no!' 'He broke his head over it, and found a solution' 'All the tricks that they ever knew, failed and collapsed. 'Hopes became weak, as this miracle continued' 'Death is a debt that cannot be stopped' 'As they realized this, they received an order' 'Even the smart ruler, died and was buried' This is why I always tell everyone... Did you get it? Huh? And thus, I'm always busy here. Hey Vaishakhan! Sukumaran doesn't know how to ride it. To Beewi's house. He'd be eating and sleeping there for the next 3-4 days. Beewi's eldest son Abubacker has died. Don't you think this village has some problem? Grandpa says that it was cursed. These are the people who have died, from this house. He must be kidding. And grand pa says that whatever dad teaches, is not right. How else can he teach? To tickle your dad? Get up, Master. Look! Anyone wants to hear about a death? Whoever dies here, Kooman knows that immediately. What to say! He died instantly when he fell from the tree. The kid's mischief! Give me one glass, son. What the hell is coming, oh God? Yes. The same. Where are you from? What's your name? Who died here today? Aren't you sad that your buddy died? Whom do you like the most here? Useless! Old man! Three... The women are all in the sweets kitchen. The festival at Shiva Temple on the other shore starts tomorrow! And Persia. Oh Lord! This girl! Grandpa wants some water. You &your... Throw it away! - My Neyyappam! Neyyappam! Senseless idiot! 0n the other shore, this will be a big problem. No one knows what happened. The villagers searched all overthe village. It took 3-4 hours for him to regain consciousness. 'There was a Djinn as tall as a tree in front of Jabbar.‘ Moreover, he can see dead people now Who is that? Pappan... Not for me. It's for the Djinn. Sukuetta, camera. Jabbar is lying! Your grandson has grown as tall as you. The Djinn is here. Tie it up right above where she keeps her head while sleeping. Grandpa! Open your mouth. From the North, if you remove the fifth tile, This side? - This side. l'll showyou. Grandpa is waiting outside. What? Climb fast. Isn't this a mango tree? - That. 'Did the mind hum like a bee?' 'The snowfall l'm drenched in, did it shower through your playful words?' 'Did those blue eyes speak something?‘ 'The drizzle ofthe sweet first rain' 'Let's chirp like doves, underthe cozy shadow of the flowering tree' 'I am like the peacock feathers in the books, stroked by yourfingers' 'My mind fills up with the desire of pinching them' 'Did those blue eyes speak something?‘ 'Hey gorgeous, dress up like the beautiful full moon' 'Are you overflowing with mischief?' 'This girl has saved every single sweet dream' I made a mistake. She also grew up here, right? Or else... Don't go anywhere, grandpa. - Fida... - Coming, mom! - Anyone wants to hear about a death? - Grandpa made it? Which one? The Sreed haran who has a car? He is inside. Vaishakhan... I won't be coming back this time. You will also live long like me. I kept going on trips for a long time, because I was scared ofthat. l have defeated death, Vaishakhan. You don't knowthe amount of loss which a death causes. With love, your grandpa. Didn't you hear? Has such a thing ever happened in this village? Anyway, grand pa could have done that without dying. But... Then shall I give you Surma (eyeliner)? Then I don't want anything. Anyone wants to hear about a death? When it's time to die, no one would listen to anyone. This house is full of his junk like this! Butter-m ilk. Rig ht here! First, you see everything here in person, and understand it. I'm not coming. -You're not? Wait. It must have been some dust that went into her eye. I came running, praying that you shouldn't survive. Do you knowthat? Have you heard that God calls good people back quite early? 0h! The one who goes on trips! Do you knowwhat all happens here? 'Those who departed, one by one' 'Those who departed, one by one' 'Is there music up there?' But I'm really high. We have the ability to steal the taste, pleasure and intoxication... I drank so much, and I'm still not high today. Vaishakhan, have you gone crazy? But, this is a different world! So what? Get in. - Sit there! They won't see us. -Jose, did you hear a song? He only brings disgrace to me. Did you hear it? They think that no one is seeing all this. When they see us, won't they see us in colour, like this? They can see us dressed only in whites. Grandpa... if we run fast, fly up and say 'Fida's house'... When are we going to reach there by foot? I fell from a tree. without smiling or being happy, and with a grumpy face, for the blunders they did while they were alive, are the dead people. It's true. Com e. You can't enter so easily. Why did I open this nouf? What is he doing? 'Like a closed door opening again, did you call me again?' 'If you search with your inner eye, you can find me right here with you' 'Yet, why didn't you reveal the love that's within you?' 'Have we been separated today, to two different worlds, to unseen distances?' 'Are tears the only chains binding us together?‘ 'This world is soaring high, this shore of happiness' Is he in this village? -Yes, indeed! 'To share the same spring season' 'Cross that cozy and cool bridge, and come here' 'l'll make a path with flowers until the moment we reunite' 'Are tears the only chains binding us together?‘ Oh Lord! Jabbar lkka! You wouldn't have known, since you were on the other shore. I totally forgot about you, Jabbar lkka. I think some evil spirit has possessed her. But this is for your sake... you won't be lucky to see the sunset on your 71st birthday. In a way, I think it was for the good. Have you even heard of such a thing anywhere? Sreedharan should be blamed for all this. Why are we all blaming a person, like the people who are alive? Let that girl die and come here. Then let Sreedharettan stay here. He will have company, right? She won't come here that quickly. Right Vaishakhan? This seems like our necessity now, Sreed haran. Yes. No! There's nothing wrong. They will be coming here, right? This isn't like that, right? My dear Vareethettan, you also joined them, huh? Anyway, I'm going to the other shore. You know how many trips I've been on, before dying? Who asked you to wait until I came? If you booze and cry out saying 'Grand pa', we can't leave from here. Within 2 weeks after! died, I was able to see the boat. Mustafa... Sreedharan! I thought I'll leave on the next boat. Right? Kids these days... We didn't come back because we wanted to. Don't you know who that is, after talking for so long? He died when my father was 12 years old. In a way, what they said is not wrong. he says that he can't wait for so long. there's only one person who can talk to people who are alive. The Big Kooman. Grandpa, he's leaving. Ask him! What do | ask him? Josetta, do one thing. Get down here. Wajida, Sukumaran is here. You both are always seen together, right? He said 5 o'clock and came at 3 o'clock itself? This bride-seeing ceremony wasn't necessary now Dear... - Come downstairs, fast. -Who is it, mom? Suhra... - Fida... - Dear... Fida, dear... Get up! Why do you need Jabbar? Abubacker! Hour? She fainted as soon as she saw me. But... Jabbarlkka, shall I get a juice for the Djinn as well? I saw her lying unconscious when she went to take a bath. It won't happen today. - I'll go alone. What were you looking at, grandpa? That's a blessing from God. they can see dead people and talk to them. anyone would wish to see those who were with us in our past, rig ht? Well, Sreedharan... You had cheated even the Beewi during your younger days, huh? Nabisa. All ofyou! I agreed to come with you, when you persuaded me. I want to live with you for a long time. Can you give me a kiss? In return... Where is the yellowArali flower? - It's in the garden. Wajida... - What is it? Com e. It's time. This will be awesome. She must be sleeping with the door shut. Run! Cut it, I say! Cut it, Beewi... Who is this clown? Now because of you, I got salvation from this land. Son? I'll come. You leave, Beewi. to click a good photo before dying. So Sukumaran didn't know this job very well. Pour it. Pour the whole thing. She's coming. Let's stop this, grandpa. Death is really painful. Do you want Neyyappam? Hey! Call someone! Huh? What's that? Sheesh! I shouldn't have said that! Who is this? Put him down. The villagers had to save the one who jumped to save her. What did you do, Beewi? Just because grandpa said something... I would have had to eat this, attend the funeral prayer, and go home. Grandma. Don't be sad listening to all this. I know everything about this place. This won't happen, dude. You come! There was someone who loved me a lot. He tried to say it to me, in every way he could. There's a story that he used to say. That's when God gave us a curse, that is death. this Earth which was a heaven, turned into hell. God gave them salvation from the curse. And thus, until death we lived in hell, and afterthat, in heaven. lblis started telling humans about the story ofthe salvation from this curse. Finally, the lblis started making humans fight between each other. Those who died, returned to the old heaven. The boat was late, right? Nice. Okay! Here. The piece is over? I'll get the pieces now Give it here. To study? There are no Mad rasas or schools here, rig ht? Forthat, you have to go on trips. He can see dead people. The dead people are more in number here, right? They won't go anywhere. I've seen people who have seen dead people. If someone we really love, dies... When I got scared of a nightmare &woke up, Jabbar has been blessed by God. There's a Djinn inside him. He's just saying that there's a Djinn. There's no proof, right? Or is itjust hearsay from what the Fakir said? lfthey are next to us, it feels like a breeze hitting on our face. It's because of them. Didn't I warn you, Sulaiman? Don't try to misguide us after learning some nonsense from the other shore! Fida! Didn't I tell you that she's protected by the Djinn, Sulaiman? Even our Konapri...
