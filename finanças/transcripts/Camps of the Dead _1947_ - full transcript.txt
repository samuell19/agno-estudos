FRENCH NEWS PRESENTS CAMPS OF THE DEAD DOCUMENTS BY ALLIED AND FRENCH WAR CORRESPONDENTS The land of horror, it opens here, on this siding, along this abandoned train which conducts no one. Here, they didn't bother to construct a camp. The wooden cars were good enough for a no doubt temporary lodging. And in these cars, 2,500 deportees, torn from all the countries of Europe, were condemned to live, that is, to die. One day they were picked up, a family here, a man there, a woman elsewhere, random raids and deportations. Babies were taken with their mothers, good men were guarded. Those who had not yet lived, those who were almost done living, made a good start on death. And one day they all found themselves there, enclosed in this train of merchandise, on a box with no exit. Indeed, there was no exit. How many died? Half? The Germans didn't count. Why count, indeed, since one day the lost train must find itself empty. This was a small camp, one of the least known, but a camp like the others. There was killing, there was torture. A little camp, with barracks and common graves. And the graves, in the end, were more crowded. Only when the graves are emptied will we know the number of corpses they swallowed. All the Germans of the village work at this appalling task. But were these deaths necessary for all the men of a village to become grave-diggers? General Eisenhower could testify to the horrors of Ohrdrus. With a tense face he visited this camp where the Nazis organized a factory of torture. How many are there here, who have known clubs, beatings, cigar burns, famine? How many died, assassinated? Thousands of men followed one another here. They died every day, new ones were furnished to fill the void. Many people in Europe had to die for the glory of the German Reich, or die there, of misery, fatigue, brutality, hunger. The corpses were emptied of all human substance. This depot of death fed butchers and common graves. In this shocking promiscuity, men continued to live. Men seen as beasts, or seen as crazy. Perhaps among them was a savant, a genius. This is what the Germans did to them. Dachau, with Buchenwald, headed up this death list. It was a nice camp, established before the war for the anti-Nazis, a nice camp for which the Nazis saw a long future. The future of its detainees was itself strictly limited. The trenches which crossed the camp took away corpses every day, those who precipitated the Nazi's hate, or simply despair. There were thousands of women in Dachau, amidst a crowd which reached 60,000 at times. A crowd perpetually renewed, the dead replaced at once with new lives. Their treatment was as awful as the men's. Some among them served as guinea-pigs in experiments by German doctors, without anesthesia, of course. One was used in artificial insemination experiments. Another gave five spinal cord samples in a single week. Another was the subject of phosphorous burn studies. The most shocking scientific sadism was given free rein. The skeletal corpses are enough. The prisoners were charged for the clothes which they wore, and which served for the next arrivals. The crematory fires didn't cease day or night, and the cycle began again with the dressing of new arrivals. At Dachau, death was done by assembly line. In Germany's last days, a last train arrived at Dachau. It came from Buchenwald. It brought 1,600 convicts evacuated before the Allied advance. The trip lasted ten days. Ten days without water and without food. 600 unfortunates died in this convoy, transformed into a rolling cemetery. Elsewhere, the Germans did better. They put the detainees on a munitions pile they couldn't move, and they blew up everything. This is Buchenwald. It's a name that poetically means "beechwood". They make gallows from this wood in Germany. The commission of inquiry from British Parliament visited this camp at the time of its liberation. They found traces of an immense crime. Spread out over 200 hectares, Buchenwald contained 65 barracks, destined to contain 18,000 detainees. They had them, up to 86,000. In that hell which had no precedent, five thousand detainees died every month. Five thousand per month, one every ten minutes. The industry of death functioned at capacity. People died on the schlague. People died by hanging. People died by bludgeon. The crematory fires, burning day and night, couldn't keep up with the rhythm of death. The heaps of burnt remains grew every day. Buchenwald was simply a factory of great output. The point was that one died. There were execution squads. There were injections which burst the arteries. And 50,000 Jews were implicated simply by their arrival. There were also dogs, and flame-throwers. It was a perfected camp. The factory pounded. The S.S. amused themselves. The camp director's wife liked original tattoos, unfortunately for those who brought them. They were slaughtered quickly, and their tanned skin served to make a new lamp-shade. At the rate of 300 corpses per day, the crematory fires weren't enough. The corpses piled up. While waiting for new graves to open, they agonized. During the last days, the Germans got scared. They rushed to erase the evidence of their crimes. The furnaces were abandoned. Before closing the doors, they cast out the living. But the crime spoke too loudly. At Tehkla, it was worse. The day of their departure, the S.S. locked in a barracks three hundred prisoners. Then, they set it on fire. Only four, four out of three hundred, succeeded in escaping the torture. At the price of what anguish, and what pain? Beneath the floorboards of the burning barracks, the unfortunates succeeded, with other comrades, in digging a hole through which they escaped. Not everyone. They still had to cross the electric wires which surrounded the camp. The four escapees succeeded in passing. For their companions, stuck on the barbed wire, they were an easy target for the machine guns and flame throwers. At Belsen, 65,000 detainees, including 28,000 women and children, were still alive at the Allied arrival. All the jailers weren't able to flee. Their chief, the executioner Kramer, is a prisoner today. He will pay. His aides, arrested with him, will pay too. The women like the men, for there were women, women even more sordid and ferocious than the males. Life at Belsen pushed the limit of what separates man from beast. A stagnant pool served the needs of all the prisoners. The Germans, as they say, are the propagators of culture, of progress, and even sanitation. To eat, a hazy soup or some detritus swimming in the water. It's not surprising that in this regime, the majority of deportees became living skeletons. Nor is it surprising that cases of cannibalism occurred. Vermin swarmed over these weakened bodies. Epidemics ran wild. But unfortunately for the sick, they were condemned. The health conditions were such that at the Allied arrival, 800 deportees died per day. 80,000 deportees perished among these sinister barracks. German civilization delivered them to violence, to savagery, to sickness, to famine, and sometimes, in the name of science, to vivisection. Finally Mittelgladsbach was, according to the Germans, in this tragic enumeration, a bucolic stop. It was listed as a rest camp. But it was the camp of typhus. Nearly all these men with arms tattooed with a number were struck by horrible sickness. They were left to agonize without care, covered with vermin and shaking with fever, in their filthy barracks, soiled with excrement. Mittelgladsbach, the rest camp. How many died every day? An unimportant detail, since they would all die. Death is indeed eternal rest, and Mittelgladsbach was the rest camp. And the graves of Mittelgladsbach were filled, day after day, while at the same time graves were filled at Dachau, Buchenwald, Auschwitz, Majdanek, Belsen, and all these cities of unpardonable crime. They were filled with hollow bodies, reduced to the most absolute skeletons. They were filled with dead flesh which once had thought, action and life. Mittelgladsbach, the rest camp. And in this strange prison, where Germany enrolled typhus as another torturer, there remained the living. But here, words fail. The "danse macabre" of old legends and church paintings, here it is. Here the dead are upright, and they walk. They have no words, but their wounds speak for them. They speak of cities of the dead that the most disordered imagination could't have invented without German sadism. They confirm that all these camps had only one purpose: extermination. And if there is a difference, it's only in the number of victims. In the crime, there is none.
