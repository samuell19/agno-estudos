Can I borrow your bike? - Where do you want to go? - Home. And where is that? Straight ahead and to the left. And how will you return it? I just need to feed Rexi, and I'll be right back. Go with him. I'll wait at the buffet. -Aren’t you going to ride the bike? -No. Are we close? I think so. Is this your house? No, we don’t have chickens. - But do you have a dog? - Yes. Rexi. Would you like a drink? Where is your wife? At home. And what's her name? Stefanija. Ms.Stefanija certainly Would have fed the dog by now. If you give him food, he eats. No matter what, he's always hungry. That’s why we named him Rexi. Bruno! Bruno, what are you doing here? We pick cherries and we reach... and then we exhale! Now we breathe in very slowly... We pick cherries... and we exhale! We put them in the basket... and we exhale again! Up, up... We reach right up there... and we exhale! Now once more... Our theme for today is water. Let's make some collages. We have several options. Cut a piece from the one you like the most, ...stick it on... ...look for another piece... ...and little by little, create your own view of the water. All this water is flowing somewhere. The small water flows to the big water. To the big river, or to the sea. How does the small water know to flow towards the big water? It doesn’t know. It goes on instinct. Good boy. Good boy! Come here ... Rexi! Rexi? Come here... Mr. Dare. Mr. Bruno, haven't you eaten anything yet? I'm not hungry. There you go. You need iron. Mr Bruno, please. How are you? Good. Stubborn little guy, don’t you think? Good Morning. -My name is Bruno. -Good morning, Mr. Bruno. -May I sit here? -Sure. This is a nice place. I don't like it. What can we do? Every day is a new day. We wake up early and start from scratch. That's true. What's eaten can't be eaten again. -How long have you been here? -I arrived today. You too? -You’re new too? - Yes. All in all, it’s nice. Today, for example, It's sunny. That's great, isn't it? Sun is very important. Walking is also important. For sure. We must walk every day. At least half an hour. Could give me one of your pieces? My piece? Could you give it to me? Teacher, can I go to my room? -Will you come back later? -Yes. Then you can go. -Are you leaving? -I’m going home. It’s not a good time. Stefanija is home alone, and Rexi needs food. Let's go back inside... Hello. I'm not too old I'm not too old To love you I'm not too old To leave Alone with you If you want to If you want to Wait for me On that day, you will have All my love To yourself. Why don't you pass the ball to the others? Why are you putting grapes in my basket? -I don't have mine. -Then go look for it. Please excuse me. What's up with you? Nothing. I'm looking at the sky. And? I'm moving the clouds. And how do you move the clouds? I see the cloud... ...and it’s not moving. Then I tell it... ...to go for a walk. And it leaves slowly. I will not apologize to you. That was the first time that I picked grapes in my life. It’s good not to have done everything in your youth. Have you ever sailed on a boat? Sure. I would like to sail. It’s nice. Where? Down a stream... to the river. And then down to the sea. And then all through the sea. Have you ever played an instrument? I used to sing. Every year, we would visit Sanremo. The real music was there! We heard an Italian woman sing in 1964. All of the musicians were Italian. Her voice was soft... ...quite subtle. I didn't understand a word, but just the same, I had fun. Music is just music. She held her hands out, and suddenly, I was already behind. I never found out how she followed it. She was here for an hour, and then she left! And? I felt different. What does that matter? How I got here, how you got there? Of course it matters! We arrived by van. So? So? Didn’t I say I preferred to go by boat? I said that. But that doesn't matter. So what matters to you? A lake... ...water that stays still. A sea... A sea is in motion. The waves always moving, and then breaking against the coast. A river... A river also moves. Some rivers run pretty fast. And then, there are the waterfalls. Our Mrs. Dusa knows all about it. Mr. Bruno, there's someone who wants to see you. See me? Who? I don’t know, you guys have so many visitors. -Teacher, can I leave? -Sure. -Does she know me? -She said she did. The colors. They are also important. The water we drink, transparent, In nature, it is usually green or blue. They’re not watering the plants. So they will dry up. Do you know my wife? Her name is Stefanija. Yes, I know her. How is she? She should come visit me. Mom died three years ago. Died? How? Why didn't you tell me before? We went to the funeral together. People brought lots of flowers. A white airplane flew over the cemetery. Look. Beautiful. Very beautiful. Yes... We have to sell it. To who? I don’t know. For anyone who wants to buy it. But why? It’s empty and falling apart. Are you going to sell it? Our house? And the birch too? Do you know what they say about birch trees? I know. That birch trees absorb all the water, So it's better not to plant anything around them, because it will not grow. Now would you say I’m a birch too? Yes. I hope you’re not too serious about that. You're just a birch. No words We will meet Somewhere again She reaches out her hand As if no time Had passed As if no time Had passed No words We will leave in the morning With the everlasting wish I would go anywhere A dream home You found your home You found your home Sir, are you looking for something? I'm taking a walk. What do you want? Nothing. I'm walking too. I'm sorry! What are you doing in my room? This is my room. Yours too? I think so. Lord, what a problem! We were in the same bed. Oh, what a problem. Are you single? I'm not. Neither am I. Then why did you chase me? You chased me. Do you want to go out? Do you want me to leave? Do you want me to leave? You smell good. I smell good? Never heard that before. Did I snore? You snored. -Loudly? -Loudly. -Sorry -It’s fine. Did you sleep well? I slept. So how do you know I snored? Men snore. Some women also snore. And how do you know that? I know. Are you saying I snored? I don't remember. I must have snored. I don't remember. You are kind. You are also kind. You want to go... for a walk? Why? I like talking with you . I like to talking with you . Let's walk then? It’s almost breakfasttime. Can we go after breakfast? All right. This one is my favourite. Very cute. I’m not get changed in front of you. Okay. Mr. Bruno, is there something wrong? Why aren't you in your room? I don't have a room. Don't be silly! Of course you do! Let's go there together, okay? Very good! Play, Bruno, play! Sweetie! Remember me? Did you bring Rexi? -Who? -Rexi. The dog? Yes, our Rexi. I didn't bring him. Did you feed him? Dad, I was a child when we put him to sleep. You know they don’t allow dogs here? I know. Bring him to the fence, and I’ll escape. Okay? Okay. I sold the house. Our house? Yes. A man came to view it, and then his wife. I think they will take good care of it. Do they have kids? Yes. That’s good. The children... can play in our garden. Aren't you mad at me? Why would I be mad? Let's go. Where? To the funeral. I don't like funerals. You have to go.
