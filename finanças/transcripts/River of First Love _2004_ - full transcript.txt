RIVER OF FIRST LOVE How are you? How are you? Shinpei! Remember to back home before supper! Take care, don't run so fast! Grandpa, did you catch anything? No yelling! I'm not your grandpa! And I haven't any grandchild! Got it! - No yelling! - I got it! Got it! A cuckoo. Want me to draw you? Thanks. How is your grandma? Oh, maybe she can't hear me. How is your grandma? Why can she hear only you? She can hear cuckoo's tweedle too. Don't lie to me, she can't even talk. She can talk with me. Don't lie to me anymore. I'm not lying! They two lead up again. Hey, Shinpei! No yelling! - My father said that he is crazy. - My mother says the same. You have many there. If you came the first here, it's easy to catch so many. Sayuri, give me some. Stop it, these are too little. Let me catch a big one. I'm going too! Bastard! What are you doing, Shinpei? It's dangerous! Why can't you see. What are you thinking about? What are you doing? Eizo! Eizo, he drew it again. Shinpei. I'm sorry. All right, everybody makes mistakes. You are really absorbed into drawing. Well, do you wanna go to Tokyo? Tokyo? Remember, your picture was bought by a gallery from Tokyo. Yeah. He asked whether if you are going to Tokyo to draw for him. I thought you might be willing to, instead of working here. Don't you want to draw pictures? I'd like to... What's an opportunity? You like drawing, don't you? What job can you imagine that is better than this? OK. All right. You should take off, the sooner, the better. Tomorrow, I will let him know. Did Shinpei comply with it? Yes... but he did it unwillingly. However, he did it for the sake of Sayuri. I know it. I know it. For the sake of Sayuri, it's better her to marry Eizo. That's why Shinpei must be away from here. I know it. What you did for Shinpei is adequate. Hiring him, accommodating him, paying for his education. You cooked up all this. Such as the rich man from Tokyo. Enough. I cannot help but cook it up. I did all this for the sake of Sayuri. You are right, there's nothing else we can do. Are you leaving? How about Sayuri? She says she will wait for me all the time. How about her mother? Nothing. Shinpei... come back as soon as you finish in Tokyo. OK. I heard it. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. I get it. You hurt me. Mother. I said that you mustn't run in and out. I'm sorry. She says we can see more fireworks here. Both up and down to the sky. Double fireworks? Mother says this is the VIP watch stand. Really... It's so beautiful. Father comes. You look very happy. It's so beautiful. Shinpei. We are home now. Have you waked? What are you doing Shinpei? What do you think I'm going to do? Missed. No, you foul. No, I'm not. Shinpei. I got you. - Mom is tired. - Mother splashed the water on me! Father can't hear you. - He can hear if he is hearing me. - What are you saying? - He can. - Shinpei is taking advantage of me. I heard from my grandpa that there are lots of fish too. Shinpei... What can you hear? What is Sayuri thinking about. Sayuri can hear it, can't she? Mother asks whether you can hear this? She can hear what I'm thinking about, she says. You two are truly close friends. You know each other clearly. Cicada. Cicada. Oh, it flew away. It flew away. You are back. - Hello. - Hello. It's so big. Thank you. Come in, please. Excuse me. You want some chocolate? Thanks. I'm playing with Sayuri. I will. What? She asks me to draw you. You want me to be drawn? - Yes. Sit there, please. - OK. Shinpei, you are good at fishing. There was someone good at fishing, too. He is the one who I loved. He fished a kind of fish which is said to be mystic. It was about 40 years ago. He promised to see me again when fishing another mystic one. But he never came again. He forgot about me. Mother is scared. Mother is scared of you. Look, how much I caught! Oh, what's this? Shinpei has become an expert. Mother, is father an expert, too? Of course, your father is an expert who is inferior to no one. Father is an expert! Father is an expert! 12, 13, 14, 15... 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21... That's great, 23, 24, 25... - That's great, are you OK? - I'm OK. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! OK. The picture should be hung on the wall. My god! Mom forget about cooking the dinner. I'm hungry, but I feel good. Mother's face is shining... like a fairy. Shinpei! Shinpei, you'd better do some cleaning! What? It's Amemasu. It must be Amemasu! It's Amemasu! I can't believe it! What are you doing? Hey, you can't use this. I saw the Amemasu. I can't fish it on my own. Can I borrow it? Come on! Come on! Shinpei, what's wrong with you? - Shinpei! - Why did you throw it away? The baton is to be held when running. Ran away. You are trying to smile to me? Am I funny? The Amemasu can also smile! Sayuri, that's the Amemasu. I made it smile. That's the Amemasu, the biggest fish. It might thought that I was funny, so it laughed at me. Come here, come on. It's over there. It might have swum away. It's truly great gear. Father used it. I was going to catch it by this one, but I failed. Are you trying to make friends with us? It's too heavy, I will ask someone to fetch it. All right, thank you. Satsuki. That man left me. I'm sorry. I know that you are always missing him, but you must go on alone. Your husband has been dead for 4 years. Without Takakura I must have died. Don't say so. He was just such a person. He said that mountain was dangerous. But I didn't trust him... That's OK, stop telling this. Shiro. He was the best man in the world. But you must take care of yourself. You are welcome here always. I can manage. I bring Shinpei some fish bait. Do you want some beer? Brace yourself up, please. - What are you looking for? - I saw nothing, what are you looking for? - She is Takakura's lover. - Low down your voice. - What a pity she is alone. - She isn't alone. - Many guys around her. - Are you one of them? - Of course not. - You don't qualify to her? - What a pity. - What a pity. I heard all you said. Please don't talk about that. I don't have husband. All of you are so disgusting. Satsuki! Smells great! Shinpei, take enough food. - Smells great! - Delicious? - Yeah. - Why don't you eat, Mom? - We have more, eat it. Be careful. Mom... Amemasu said, when he grows up he will bring his bride. Really? Where did you get this? Amemasu told me that when it is pouring, water will rise and bring his bride. Amemasu told you that? We are friends. Amemasu said it would bring his bride? Since he told you that, it is the truth. OK, you should go to sleep. We will go to sleep. Mom... Did dad meet Mom? What to say? Will he meet you some day? Amemasu said that he knew when to meet the bride. He said the bride came from the mountain. If dad comes to meet you, will you go with him, Mom? Mom... won't go anywhere. I had a dream that day. In different colors. - Understand. - ...teacher Shinpei, what are you drawing? I have a 59 year old grandma. I often go visit her. Her name is Nakayama Shizuko. Grandma always tells me old stories when she is washing clothes... I have done it! Have you done it? - What is it? - What a funny fish. Shinpei, teacher will keep it for while, OK? Can you hear Sayuri? He says he catches. See you tomorrow. Can I draw you? Right? I will draw. Are you sure? Are you sure? Sayuri, I've heard you could draw everything. I am waiting to show you the real drawing. It's the picture of Sayuri. Look carefully. Not bad. It's great. It's really great. It's a good likeness of you. It's awful. Too bad, all of these are drawn by Shinpei. It isn't like you at all. Sayuri, this guy's drawings are so terrible. Beat the devil. What garbage it is! Ei Zao, wait a moment! Thank God, the face isn't broken. Today is the deathday of Taka Kula. Could I burn some incense for him? Please. - Takakura, I am so sorry. - Don't say that. If I had followed your word, I would have never... I am so sorry. What did you say? - Have some tea. - Thank you. Please. I suggest you have a walk on the street. Do shopping or something... Go shopping? At least buy you some beautiful clothes for him. This was his intention a moment ago. He never bought me anything. That's why I told you, it's him. Want me to do so? Mr. Takakura. I can hear his voice now. It's about Shinpei. Yes, Shinpei. If you want to repay his obligation. Then please, you take more care of Shinpei. - Satsuki, you never speak out. - This will depend on you. I know. Don't say so. I will feel embarrassed. Actually, I have some other things to talk to you about. Satsuki... - I treat you... - I am back. Hey, Shinpei! Uncle! Say hello. - Hello. - Hello. Thank you for accompanying Sayuri, to play all the time. - We are good friends. - I see. Satsuki, I have to say goodbye now. Thank you for coming. Bye, Shinpei. Goodbye! - I give it to you. - Really? Too big. Shinpei will grow up soon. Then it will fit well. Cool. Happy Birthday Mom. Wait! There it is! The bride is coming. Hey, come over here! Yes, the bride is so beautiful. Have to go already? I am coming to say goodbye. When? Right now? He is waiting here to say goodbye. Bye! Bye! Bye! We are just like rain trout. Anyone here? I am Shinpei's teacher, Sasaki. Coming. Thanks. Shinpei, what have you done? Shinpei has achieved a significance. Sorry. Mom has blamed you undeservedly. Yes, I'm Shinpei's teacher, my name is Sasaki. This time Shinpei's picture won Paris Children's Award. It is an award with a long history. It is very honoured. Shinpei is the eighth who has won the second award. It is so great. Are you OK? Today, President Takakura holds such a great ceremony. Next, welcome President Takakura. Address the toast speech for us, please. Cheers, everyone. Congratulations, Shinpei. The ceremony for kids has been held in the school. Today is a ceremony for the adults. Congratulations, Shinpei's Mom. Toast. Please drink as much as you can, I have enough wine here. Come in, please. You look tired, please sit down. Thank you. Mom's glass is empty. Thank you. Thank Shinpei, I enjoy his luck as well. It is the teacher who brought us the luck. Teacher, please come over here. Satsuki, don't push yourself so hard. But... You don't look well. Where do you feel uncomfortable? Haven't drank so much in a long time. Shinpei has fallen asleep in my room. - I am sorry. - Please stay, we together. I have a lot of things to do tomorrow morning. It would be sorry to wake up Shinpei. Let him sleep here for one night. Cause you so much trouble. Satsuki. Are you OK? I am OK. I send you back, OK? Thank you for today. Mom! Sorry for letting you wait so long. Please sit. Was it easy to find here? It's OK. I'm sorry, I didn't see you at the door. I forgot to make an introduction. My name is Yoshi Zao. Please. My name is Kato. I will be frank, I like your "Rain Trout" very much. Your new works? New works? I just open a new restaurant and want to hang some of your pictures on the wall. On the wall... Sorry, this lady will tell you the details. I apologize that I can't accompany you. Please take care all the things here. I am sorry. Shinpei? Hey, Shinpei, we haven't tidied up yet! So beautiful. Miko-chan has become a Tokyoite. I'm from Hakkaido, Shinpei. We have been friends since we were young. We draw right here. After seeing your "Rain Trout", the boss of this restaurant wants one to hang here. What? It is unbelievable. How is the girl who is always with you and whose name is Sayuri? - Is she fine? - Yes, she's fine. I always recall those times. I came to Tokyo after my primary school. All of us have changed. No one has changed. This is for daily use. Refrigerator is here. Shinpei hasn't changed at all. Have I changed? Please call me if you need me. I will come at any time. This is the key. OK, work hard. Takakura's home? Waiting for letters from Shinpei? Sayuri, you can write to him. It will disturb him. Shinpei... I have no emotion to draw? Depression? It's nothing. If Sayuri were aside, you would draw easily. It is because she isn't here. It is no use for me to be here? Letter. I will write to Sayuri. Tell her to come to save you? OK, I will draw. Sayuri... There is no rain trout here. President. I need to talk. About Sayuri... About your daughter. I am looking forward to the day. I agree totally that you and Sayuri to be together. Please help me more in the future. Thank you, Eizo. Please help me too, Sayuri. Please, sit down. From now on, please take care of Sayuri. Please take care. I will do my best. This time I can put my heart in my chest. Remember Shinpei? Do you know why he went to Tokyo? It was not for drawing. President even advised him. It was his own choice. He was tired of your poor hearing. If you can't recover quickly, he doesn't want to be with you anymore. Really, it's obvious that he didn't write you for so long. Nanny has heard about the marriage of you and Eizo. Eizo is the only successor here. You are unwilling to be together with Eizo? Sayuri need someone to take care. Your dad said so too. Do you understand his intention? If Sayuri get married, Nanny will be very happy too. If she were not deaf, she might have had a totally different life. Sayuri! The engagement banquet will be held on the 3rd of next month. Do we have enough time to prepare? All things will rely on you. What else do you want to know? I don't understand. Won't this kid think narrow, will she? There is nothing we can do. It is for the good of Sayuri to marry Eizo. Shinpei? It is so good, the fever has gone. Fever? It is only a cold. Shinpei, it's a pity. It is painful that he can't draw. Work hard! Success! Nanny. Urgent! The engagement date of Sayuri and Eizo is this Sunday. Hello. Sayuri. Sayuri. Will Sayuri marry me just like the rain trout? Sayuri will be my bride when she grows up. Mom. Mom! Can this work? It is OK. Eizo! Grandpa. You hooked the divine fish? It won't work if we change place. If the river changes, people changes too. Where is the divine fish? Shinpei... Catch your divine fish. Shinpei. I want to clarify to you. Otherwise, I can't set my heart at rest. I will marry Sayuri. I don't think I should apologize to you. I love Sayuri more, since I was young. Sayuri likes to draw, I learn to draw. Harder than any others. For Sayuri, I can do anything, even running a corporation. I resigned the work in Tokyo. I came back here for Sayuri. You can only draw and stay together with Sayuri. I care about Sayuri very much. So much for my word. I had to let you know. Thank you for the hard work. Engagement Banquet Sayuri? What? Shinpei. Be happy this time. Nanny... Bye. Nanny, can I come in? What's up? Mom, have you seen Sayuri? What happened to Sayuri? Nothing. Sayuri! Mr. Takakura! It's Shinpei. Shinpei brought Sayuri away. Shinpei? Don't worry, I will catch him. How did they keep in touch? They don't need to talk. Eizo, what's up? They both, whether they... Hey! Grandpa, bye! Good, so good to be young! There! There they are! Can't run away! I have only Shinpei in my heart. How about me? There is no use, whatever I will do? I am sorry. You have been so tender for so long. Sayuri... Go home. Let's go home. What? What? Go back home! Eizo! I am for you! Enough! Please understand. For Sayuri. Shinpei, hurry up! Eizo, thanks! Sayuri...
