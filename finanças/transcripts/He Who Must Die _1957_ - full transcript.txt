HE WHO MUST DIE Don't cry. Someday we'll end up chasing away the Turks. With you... or with your son. Wait! Loukas, help him. Carry his bag. Don't touch that. Nobody can touch that. My father's bones. And his father's. We'll build our new village on them. Greeks... get up! We'll find another village... And brothers to welcome us. Let's go! So you're cutting off some hair today, Andonis? Sure! You all think you'll get the best roles. I've shaved quite a few Christs and apostles since this morning. And you, who is this for? St. James! But shave me only on one side! That way, if they take me, I'll already have half the beard. And if the Agha doesn't give his permission? You'll shave the other side! Come on, kids! There... the Persian army, Tario's hordes ready to attack. Here, this tiny little troop. Who is it, kids? - It's us! - Yes, it's us! Yes, us, the Greeks! Ten thousant versus a million! And who's in command? Myciades! Myciades, yes! One Greek to a hundred Persians! It doesn't matter. Forward! - Forward! - To the sea, to the sea! All the Persian... to the sea! Conquerors all along the line! One of these days, you'll see it'll be the Turks's turn. We'll flatten the Turks. We're the sons of the soldiers of Marathon. Bravo! Come here! Bravo, General! But the Agha has good ears. If ever he finds out how you treat his Turks... - you'll have to watch out for your neck. - My neck? Well... I thing you'll be eligible for a nice tie. - You think so? - Yes, I think so. By the way, did he give his authorization? The Agha wouldn't dare refuse! What did you say? I said that the Agha is so kind. May God hear your world! Here the postman! - It's about time! - Better late than never! Still nothing for me? My sister from Smyrna has been pregnant for at least 18 months. - Just a bit too long. - What about her? She's not pregnant anymore. You have a nephew. I mean, it's possible. Yannakos, since we know that you steam open all the letters... why do you bother gluing them back? It's my punishment. Hey, Tavis... a raki for Yannakos! I have a nephew. He told me! He's so crude! Aren't you ashamed to beat up your wife in front of your customers? Oh, I make sure not to hurt her too much. Woman need to bo tought their place. Hey, what about the one coming this way? Who's teaching her? Here she is! Isn't it a bit early for you to start working? Yes, it is. But there are so many men to marry around here... I have to get an early start. Panayotaros, don't humiliate me in front of the whole town. Katerina! Go home and get dressed. Go! I'm not naked! I mean decently. You have to come to church! - To church? - It's an order from Father Grigoris! Really? I see! Go on, hurry up! There's no hurry. The Agha hasn't given his permission yet. We're talking care of it... hurry up! Not yet! Well, come on, my dear Agha, say yes, okay? The whole town is waiting. They've been playing this secret Passion every seven years since... The last time was in 1914, the year of the War. Come on... say yes, dear Agha, okay? Your Jesus is such a sad God... while our Allah is such a cheerful artist! If you're thirsty, he'll give you this delightful raki. Hungry? He'll make up cinnamon rice. If you're ever angry, he'll give you a kowtowing Christian. And what kind of melancholy could resist this marvel named Youssoufaki? It's true... the world is a beautiful success! Oh, look, the widow! That one was made just to cool down your old passions. Mine and everyone else's. It's our Christian charity! But I was just thinking, Patriarcheas. What if Grigoris chooses her to play that sinner... what's her name? - Mary Magdalene. - That's it. Stop your games and lovemaking and your massaga sessions. Mortal sins. Oh, thanks you for reminding me. So, it's a yes? May I give the signal? Okay, go ahead! Crucify each other. Flowers for Mariori! Your father worries when I cough. Aren't you afraid? Not at all. Two more months, and you'll be my wife. And we'll be together for a hundred years! - Hey, Dimitri, what a beautiful hat! - Isn't it though? - Good morning! - Good morning, Manolios! Give up! - I bet on the widow! - Give up! I bet on Panayotaros's wife! Give up! Bravo, Manolios! - She wanted to go into the church. - And so what? I was told to. Do you hear me, you old bag? Told to! Invited by the priest! - You whore! - What's going on here? You did tell me to go church, didn't you? Yes, I did. Everybody to church! Don't you know where I live? Of course. Then why don't you ever come to visit me? I couldn't give you any "gifts. " Don't worry about that. I'll wait for you tonight. You look so handsome! - She moves the same way your wife did. - God rest her soul. Thank you, Uncle. Let's get to work. Quiet! Here we all are, gathered with joy and devotion... to prepare the great mystery of our Lord's Passion. Holy Week is still a ways off, but as you know... God's apostles and Jesus Himself... according to tradition, must be part of the upcoming St. Elijah celebration. Therefore, to give them enough time to pull themselves together... I'll give you the names of those that we, the elder town Council members... have chosen... first, Christ's austere disciple... the apostle James. The council has chosen... the cafe-owner Kostandis. - He waters down his wine! - He doesn't fill up glasses to the top! He beats his wife! Quiet! Kostandis is far from perfect. He knows it. But he'll mend his ways, right? Yes, Father. Then I baptize you James Christ's disciple. And now, Peter the apostle... Yannakos! Yannakos the peddler, Yannakos the postal worker... we've chosen you! - He steams open the letters! - I know. But now that's over, completely over. From now on you'll have a saint as your postal worker and peddler. - Understand me? - Yes. Yes, Father. Good! Repeat after me... "I hear and obey. " I hear and obey. You're the apostle Peter. I call Michelis Patriarcheas. You'll be the beloved disciple, the apostle John. You'll be the one who will comfort and support Christ to the foot of the cross. You'll the one, my boy, to whom He will entrust His mother's care. You will be worthy of this holy mission. Bless me, Father. You're the apostle John. Panayotaros, the saddler! I have a favor to ask you, a big one. - We need you to be... - Judas! - Judas Iscariot. - Never! - You can't refuse. The elders chose you! - Unanimously! You won't make me betray Christ! Idiot, you won't betray Christ. You'll be pretending. I will not be Judas! It's the end of the world! Since when does you opinion matter? - My opinion? - Quiet! You're Judas, and that's that! The widow Katerina! I'm to be Mary Magdalene... all right, Father. Mary Magdalene had hair like honey. Don't worry. I've got the hair... and the rest. I give you my blessing. Thank you very much, Father. And now, God forgive us, we'll tell you who among you will be... Jesus, our Saviour. Manolios the shepherd! We chose you to play God's son. Come up here. You'll be crowned with thorns. You'll be crushed by the weight of the cross. You'll fall from exhaustion. You'll be crucified. But... But I... I'm not worthy. I- I can't even read, and... I can barely talk. You just have to think. Think about being tough, about being a saint! But... But, Father... Quiet. God is speaking through my mouth. Come stand around him. From now on, you're no longer Kostandis, nor Yannakos... nor Panayotaros, nor Michelis, nor Katerina, nor Manolios. You're James... Peter, Judas, John, Mary Magdalene... and Jesus. From now on, may no one in this town... look at your physical bodies... but at your hidden souls. Amen! Judas! Judas! Judas! Judas! Let me come in. No. Is it because of the shepherd? I saw you plotting with him. Is it any of your business? Judas! Judas! Katerina... don't leave me. Please. Not now. Come on. St. Peter of the Post Office. I've never seen that on the calendar. - Was St. James married? - Why? Because my wife threw a frying pan at my face again yesterday. - Wait, now that you're St. James... - Now that I'm St. James... it won't change anything at all. Still, we're lucky. What if you'd been given the role of... Remember Karolambis who played Christ 7 year ago? He was under so much pressure that he ended up crazy. - Why? - "Why?" Because the human brain is a fragile engine. A little too much and... boom! Can you imagine what it would be like for poor guys like us? And think of the apostles. We'd be in trouble. They were simple people... fishermen, farmers. But they became very great. That is something! Ordinary men... who become apostles! - What did they have that was so special? - They were inspired. They were needed! That's it, Manolios. They were needed! - So, is that all? - Of course! Listen, you're walking down the street, like anybody else. Suddenly, turning the corner, you see a house in flames. You go into the fire, you save a kid, and that's it. The passerby becomes a hero. Why? Because he was needed. Manolios, would you go into the fire? I don't know. Who are you? Where are you from? Where is the town priest? - At the Town Council! - Go get him! What's in this bag? My fortune, my boy. You can't chase them away in front of everybody. They're Greek, like you. Greek, yes, but they're beggars. Greek or Turks, beggars are still beggars. If you don't chase them off, you'll have them on your back until the end of time. You old tightwad! He's richer than I am, but he walks barefoot to spare his soles. He lives in a hole. Oh, you make me laugh. One day, he took six people home for dinner. He said to his wife... "We're having guests. Put another onion in there!" You old goat! Call the widow. You need your massage. Yes. My massage! You need one every day. Even the day your poor wife passed away. Quiet, both of you! But he's sweating raki through all his pores. Yes, I drink! And I love women! When I die, I'll leave widows all over the country... but even being a drunk. I still have more common sense than... Quiet, I said! You're in church! - That's right. - How dare you? I don't dare anything. Your long-winded speech earlier was perfect on a spiritual level, but these beggars are real. It's a totally different story, and when the tightwad... Oh, please, you have no right to... Calm down. I was about to admit that the skinfint is right. Finally! If we welcome these people... we risk having them on our hands forever. Come look at them, Agha. They're dirty. So dirty! Get your whip and beat them. Calm down, Youssoufaki. They don't need me. You see Christians are Allah's mistakes. He realized it as soon as he created the first one, then... he created a second one. And they pounced on each other. Since then, Christians have been killing each other. Let them, Youssoufaki. Here's Father Grigoris. He's going to meet the other priest. Oh, well, wake me up when they're pulling each other's beards. Move! It's all right, my dear. The trip is over. What are you doing here? Where are you from? Who are you? My name is Fotis. We've come from far away. The Turks massacred almost all of us. They burned our village. Careful, Fotis. We live in peace with the Turks here, and we intend to continue to. We were only asking to live in peace. But we're been on the road for three months... starving and leaving dead bodies behind us every day. Christ has led us to you. May God bless this day. Amen! Amen! Tell us the truth. God is fair. It's no accident that our village is prosperous... while yours has turned into ashes. Tell us the truth. What did you do to deserve such a punishment? Lower your voice, Father Grigoris! We're poor, and you're rich... but don't forget that our misfortune is close to God. - God doesn't... - Lower your voice when talk to us! We have nothing to confess. No crimes, no faults, no sins. One day our Greek soldiers walked through our village. We walked alongside them, against the Turks... Our soldier were defeated. The Turks took over our village, and then... there were 3,000 of us. Your story has touched us, but our town isn't as rich as you think. Nevertheless, we'll do all we can to help you get back on the road again. Back on the road? To go where? No, Father Grigoris. You have uncultivated land. Turn it over to us. - We'll clear it! - We'll cultivate it! We'll share the harvest with you. Turn that land over to us. The harvest? When? Next year? And who'll feed you until then? Are you going to take the bread out of our mouths? I, Father Fotis, am also in charge of souls! That's a poor reason, Father Grigoris. Everyone on Earth is in charge of his neighbor. May God inspire you with a better answer. Doesn't God inspire you? Back up, back up! There it is. It's God answering for me. Look at that woman! Her feet are swollen, her hands are tightened, her face is full. They're bringing us evil! Death! Cholera! Cholera! That's not true. It's hunger. She died of hunger. My friends, I swear she died of hunger. Hurry! Go get some quicklime. Throw it on her body. - No, I swear. She died of hunger! - Run! I swear! He lied! Cholera! Cholera! You sly one with a full stomach. Sly one with a double chin. You just committed a crime. Back up, you carriers of death! Back up, you victims of the plague! Get away! Watch out for the poison! The banner. Get up. We must take to the road. Get up. Everyone get up! It's clear we have to go. Came, Father Panagos. Manolios... don't touch him! Don't touch him! That's an order! - Is it good? - Very good. Isn't it? So the children's clothes will be white... and St. John's robe will be blue. - Have you noted that, Mariori? - Yes, Father. You like blue, don't you, Michelis? Yes. Yes. That's his favorite color. - Kostandis! - I'm here. There're going to gauge my appearance. St. James's robe must be dark. What did he say about his appearance? He means that, from now on, there are two Kostandises. The one we see, the cafe-owner, who's fake... because he doesn't exist anymore, and the saint, whom we don't see... but who's real, though he doesn't exist yet. Is that clear enough? Did you get that? Do I scare you? I dreamt about you last night. It means you've been thinking about me. Right? Leave me alone. Would you like to sleep with me? Leave him alone. He's so shy, you'll make him stammer. Shy or not, he was the only one who dared move toward the refugees. - Yannakos! - Oh, my! - Your turn! - Just a minut, I have to sort the mail. Hurry up! And don't give me that. Look, what's wrong with you all? Is it because of yesterday? The refugees? You want to ruin our town? Ruin it and kill it? - Look at the Sarakina! - They set up their camp on the Sarakina. Since last night, I can't think of anything else but them. - I couldn't sleep at all. - What could we do though? We could risk getting cholera. To leave again, to keep walking... We're following Father Fotis. We've been following him for so long. Just the idea of getting back on the road! Wait! Wait, don't put the fires out! Don't put the fires out! Let them burn! Let them burn! Wait. Don't put out the fires! Let them burn high. We're staying. Come close, everyone! Come listen! St. George, our patron... appeared in my dream. He was beautiful - as young and blond as a spring morning. He put the seed of a village in my right hand. And I saw it as it will be. With its steeple, its roofs, its school, its gardens. St. George said to me, "plant that seed," and I will plant it here! - Here? - Yes! Among these plants and heathers. Yes, I know, you,re tired and hungry, but muster your courage... and your last ounce of strength. Loukas! We'll build our village here! No errands for Yannakos. There's nothing to sell or buy over here, Yannakos. Yannakos. Come in. Come in! Go on, get out of here! Hey, Yannakos, come have a drink. What? That's a surprise! It's the first time I've ever seen you offer a drink. Never mind. Drink up. Oh, well. Cheers, Ladas. And now, tell me, what's the biggest amount of money you've ever had? Me? In this hand I once had two Turkish pounds. I swear. One... two... three. They're for you, and this is only the beginning. But why? Listen to me, Yannakos, you're going to be rich. These savages up there on the Sarakina have things that interest me. They do not! They're as poor as Job. Those women have jewels... gold wedding rings. So you go up there and tell them this: "I have oil, barley, corn... everything you need. All I ask you in exchange is your old out-of-fashion wedding rings. " And you bring them back to me. But a wedding ring is holy. It's been blessed. Would you let children die, just to keep a ring on your finger? Oh, I don't know. Listen, you'll be doing good and, at the same time, making some money. Take a chance. Come on, Yannakos, you've run around these muddy roads a long time... with dogs at your tail. Now, go! But what about cholera? - You're afraid of that? - Of course! Aren't you? Yes, yes, of course. Then eat a clove of garlic. You'll be safe. Dig, my boy. Men are just like trees. They need to take root. It seems to me you already did, Father Panagos. More than you think, my boy, more than you think. - What did you think of that? - Great, Father Fotis. As strong as a Turk. And now, follow me. We're going to mark the village limits. There we'll open the big Gate of Christ. Look down on us, O Lord, and enter into our village. Just a moment. My turn, Father Fotis. Your turn, Panagos... you certainly deserve it. Father of our fathers, don't turn to dust... before our village is built on your remains. Okay, up! What for? I can't work anymore. I can't father children. Leave me here, Father. What are you talking about? God gave you life... and only He can take it back. So get back up. No, leave me here. My time has come, my work is done. Make him get up. Come on, all of you. There we'll make St. George's door. It will be high, so he can enter on his horse. - Father! Father! - What is it? He's dead. What? Father Panagos is dead. So you knew. Peace be with you, Panagos. You even had the good fortune to die in your village. Here... right over his body... we're build the Virgin's door. Mary, you see us... this old man carried our fathers's bones on this long road... despite his fatigue and hunger. Now that the trip is over, he's lying among them. Bless this village to be build over his body. Mary, you are the Mother. You know what it is to be weak and hungry. Look at your children. Help us to live. Father, is the ewe a miracle? Why, my son? Why would human kindess be a miracle? Father! Who are you? The one who's to play St. Peter in the mystery of the Passion. But in real life... a big sinner. What should I do with these? Give them to me, my son. And if Ladas asks you for them... send him to me. And don't forget the clove of garlic. Bravo! You came to check it out. So, you see, it's not true. They don't have cholera. No. Wait till you tell them you just got back from the Sarakina. You're in for it! And then, Manolios, when you tell them the good news... - you'll be a great guy! - Wait for us here. Manolios and I will talk to them. Oh, that's not fair. We should all do it together. Are we the apostles, or aren't we? - Dimitri the butcher. - Two calves. It's not too much? The Agha eats like a horse. Okay. Next, the barber. Andonis the barber, half a Turkish pound. Half a Turkish pound. My dear Katerina, you have such wonderful hands. You've got eyes on your fingertips. What about... Ladas? Taxes for Ladas, double last year's. Are we done? Almost. - Who's left? - Why, you! Oh, yes, that's right. Well... I'll deal with the Agha personally. Perfect, Katerina, right there! Father! My son, I'm just talking care of my aching old body. Hello! What are you doing here? I hape nothing's happened to my flocks. So what do you want? Do you think I pay you to leave the livestock alone? Don't get mad. We have news for Father Grigoris. Great news! Manolios just come back from Sarakina. I had forbidden you to get close to those filthy people, those germ carriers. But no, they... They don't have cholera. How dare you? Shut up! What are you doing here? Get back to work! - Did you tell anyone? - We come straight here. Fortunately! Listen to me, you idiot! Do you know what cholera looks like? - But... - No! Then shut up! And get back to your animals! But they're going to die of hunger. That's God's business, not yours! They don't have cholera. What? Get out of here. Quick. I gave you everything you have, even those rags on your back. I got you off your filthy dungheap and made you my shepherd. Do you want to stay my shepherd? Well, then... you didn't see anything, you don't know anything, you won't say anything. Otherwise, I'll throw you out, and you can look for another job. But Michelis... You might have made a mistake, Monolios. Now go kiss Father Grigoris's hand, and apologize to him. Sorry, Father. Michelis, I don't like your associating with the help. Do you really know who these people are? Real alley cats! Give them just one crumb, and you'll never be able to get rid of them. Worse than that. Don't forget that they rose up in arms against the Turks. What do you think the Agha will do if he finds out we're helping them? Everything you see here will be yours someday. May your father live a long life! And do you know why? Because we've known how to live in peace with the Turks. Life is order and peace, Michelis. From those from the Sarakina, it's disorder and war... That's cholera! They're celebrating, that's all. I swear they're all roasting, suckling-pigs... on a spit. Everyone's celebrating. I saw them. It's a celebration for their village. Right here, my brothers, will be the Gate of Christ. Right there, the Virgin's. And here, the church. And here... And here... the school. And all that, it's just hot air. They're building their own village? What village? Hot air! And their gate opens onto...? All right. No, they're all starving to death. They sleep on stones. But they're building their village and singing their war song. Well, they're crazy! And so am I. And so are you. But you know who's the craziest one? The one over there listening to us. What did he tell you when you told him... they're starving to death up there? - Leave that alone! - No, no, you must say it again. I know, but I don't remember. He said... it's God's business. Wonderful! Isn't that wonderful? But i know someone said... "... have to relieve them of their wedding bands... " Who was that? I don't remember. But I said yes. Me, Yannakos. I said yes. What a bastard, what a bastard, Yannakos! And so, St. John/Michelis, what did he say to you? Michelis? Hey, you'd better answer me! What did he say? He said that I might have made a mistake. This is a strange night. It's like Dad would say, "candles in front of an altar. " Candles that people would burn for us. Are they going to stay long? Until they get help, or until they die, - or until a man shows up here. - Please don't blame yourself, my love. Why should that be your burden? Whose then? Whose? - Why not mine? - But cholera? It's just an image. - Are you cold? - A little bit. Hold me. What's wrong, Mariori? Listen, my love, I can't wait. Wait? You're obsessed with these people, but be careful. Your father and mine will disown you, and I will die. Mariori. The other one. I'd like to be happy with you for a moment. We also have to think of ourselves, Michelis. Both of us. Gifts! Gifts! We're going to rehearse the games of the Passion! Yeah, okay, my friends. We'll play the Passion. And we'll be the apostles. But careful, guys - for one day only. After that, no more apostles. In fact, do you know what thay want us to be? Not saints, no! Crap! Nothing but crap! Why are you singing? Are you happy? Dummy, what are you thinking about? He thinks he's Jesus Christ! Go see the widow, dummy. I'm telling you, go see the widow! She's ready to open up like a rose in the sun. But look at him, Kostandis! He wants her so bad he can't even see straight. Go, go, dummy! You're not going to leave her to Patriarcheas... your lord and master, or to that damned fake Judas/Panayotaros? Are you going or not? Come in. Who is it? Manolios. Manolios! Nice to see you, shepherd. Come over here. Here! Hey, there! He didn't come last night, but here he is tonight. Manolios. So what's going on? - You're being shy with me now? - Why? I don't know. I saw you earlier today. You're not afraid, shepherd. The other ones hang their heads, but you're not afraid. When the old man hit you, I could have scratched his eyes out. But you... - You're not afraid. - I don't want to talk about that. I'm going to tell you something. When they asked me to be Mary Magdalene... I thought that was funny. I swear it made me laugh. And now? Now? - I think I understand. - What? That woman. Manolios. I've known a lot of men. They're so cute when they talk loud and show off their muscles. But so often they're fragile and defenseless. Then one day, you find someone who isn't like anyone else. That's when you want to be just like her... the fragrance, the hair, everything. Do you know when I realized all that? This afternoon when I saw you. If it's God's will, I won't go with anybody else anymore. Not Patriarcheas, not even Panayotaros. - Only you, Manolios, only you! - Shut up! You were so beautiful in front of that old man, so brave. - Shut up! - But why? It's nobody's business. I see. - Something happened after I left. - Shut up! They scared you, right? - They're good at that. - Will you shut up? Yes. They scared you, and now you're ashamed. Stop it! Why did you come here? Why do men come to see you? For me, Manolios. Do you understand? For me. Not for themselves. What does that mean? It means you come over here to forget that you were a coward, as if you were drinking, and you think that you can't fall any lower than being here with me. But it doesn't work that way. I'll sleep with everyone! Everyone, except you! Go wallow in your remorse with whomever you want. Now leave! - I'm sorry. - Go on. Open the door, bitch! Let me in! Let me in! I saw him. I saw him. I'll kill you! I swear I'll kill you! Go away, and don't ever come back. Never again. That slut locked herself in. Good! It's the right time to show her what you're made of. Break down the door and beat the living hell out of her. - You think I should? - Of course. You're still drunk, so you can do it. Make the most of it, my friend. I'm not drunk enough anymore. You first, then the whore. She's not a... Sure, dress her in blue, she's the Virgin. Don't talk like that. - Why her? - Come on! - Listen here. - Shut up! You're a man, aren't you? Kill me! Please kill me! Turn around! Turn around! What's wrong with you? You've gone crazy! Turn around! Turn, you filthy bastard! Fake Jesus! You'll pay for that. Someday, you'll pay for that. Someday, you'll pay for that. Someday, you'll pay for that. You'll pay for that! Where are you going? To the Sarakina. Father Fotis, tell him to leave. What does he mean, his place is here? What can he do for you? For me, it's the same story as Karolambis's. He was the guy who was supposed to play Christ the last time. He was sure he saw Jesus. And did he? Father Fotis! Little Lenio is dead! He's taken my child. Give her back to me! My little Lenio! He taken my child! Give her... Thanks you, Father. Good Lord, I can't take it anymore! I've had it! It's over! The peddling, the mail, the errands. That's it! - What do you want to do? - I'm a thief, aren't I? I'll bring them supplies! Nobody home today. That's lucky! The St. Elijah procession will empty all the houses! - Yannakos, that's serious. I can't. - I'm not asking you to follow me. Understand me, my friend. I have my cafe, my wife... Bravo! Keep them. Wait for me! Don't rock her anymore. Try to understand. The weight of life is nothing. Her soul is immortal. Enough! Enough! When her child has just starved to death... it's not the time to tell her about immortality. - Belos! - This is the communal grave. I won't wait for your village to rise on top of a dead little girl's bones! Belos! Which one is the Virgin's door? Where's St. George's door? Shome me. I want to make sure I'm talking the right way out of here! It's the beginning of the end! Others will follow him. Our solidarity was all we had left. Where are your friends, Manolios? People must know what's going on here. The entire village will be at the St. Elijah celebration. You've got to go there. You have to talk to them. - But I... - You won't stammer. - But, Father... - You won't stammer! But I can't talk to people! Did you know Moses stammered? But then God said to him... - "You will talk to your people!" - No. Manolios, you won't stammer... because they need you to speak. Father. It's worse than a safe. Damn it! It's afull of shards. They're everywhere! That looks like Ladas. You can always count on him. Should we give up? Just a minute. There's still Patriarcheas. - You're not serious? - Oh, yes I am! I was proud. I answer with my fists. With my fists and my knife. Definitely my knife! And I rip everyone's stomach open! Evryone's! And Father Grigoris. Grigoris! And Patriarcheas. And little Jesus. Yes, little Jesus. Yes, and the Turks. And the Turks! And the Turks! And the Agha! So, you're happy? You're a Turk! Wake up from your dream of raki and tell me... Would you let the whore live? And what will do with the little Jesus? Don't sulk, my boy. The St. Elijah celebration isn't a sad thing, damn it! It means good wine and good food... it's fantastic! Enjoy it! You're just the right age. Laugh a little, Apostle John. No, it isn't working - the poor boy takes himself so seriously. You remind me of your mother, always into charitable works and so devoted. And as sad as Ash Wednesday! You see, I'm Mardi Gras, the best day of the Carnival! Still a long face? I'm going downstairs. I'll wait for you there. What are you doing here? We came to... It's for them. - We came to get things where we can. - What kind of things? To keep the Sarakina people from dying like dogs. Go on and turn us in... you chicken! Come. Quickly! Lord! Stop! Stop, thieves! Stop them! Stop, thieves! - Let me explain... - Not one word. It was for them, up there. We wanted to... It's time to go. Hi, Katerina! I just ask to live long enough... to marry him and give him a son. Please! Hey, here comes the shepherd. Come have a drink, Manolios. - He can't. - Why not? It's not the shepherd who's here. It's Jesus. - Yes, that's true, I forgot. - That's right... The games of the Passion start at the St. Elijah celebration. So, where are the apostles? Manolios, where are your apostles? I must speak to the people. If you want to, my boy. It's your role today. Manolios is going to speak to us. Manolios is going to speak to us! Attention! Come on, everyone! Manolios the Stammerer is going to speak to us. What are you going to tell them? You have to talk to them about Jesus. - Yes. - Great. May Heaven inspire you. Bravo, Manolios! Quiet! Go on! Dear people! My good friends... Don't worry, my boy. Babble as much as you want. Words don't matter. It's what's in your hearts that counts! Fellow townspeople... Lord... What's happeneing to me? Dear people! Can you hear? I'm speaking! God untied my tongue! I'm speaking! It's a miracle! Listen to me. I just saw a little girl die. Up there, on the Sarakina. A very young girl... who died of hunger. They're not dying from hunger! It's from cholera! And you've come to contaminate us! There's no cholera, I swear! I saw them. Ask Yannakos and Kostandis. They were with me. There's no cholera! They're starving to death. You're all here, happy and well-fed, and that's good, but... Wait! We were ready to help these people out. You were all there, and you know that. But they didn't want our charity. They wanted our land! No! Uncultivated land. Useless land that nobody wants! Manolios, and all of you, too, let me tell you: Woe betide the proud men who... pretending to be just, wants to disturb divine order! Don't forget... God Himself distributes all worldly goods... wherever He wants, however He wants. He makes the rich. He makes the poor. No, no and no! This man wants us to believe it'a all right that they're dying. - How dare you? Shout up! - Let him speak. There's nothing more to say. They're hungry. And at night, they're cold. - We have to help them! - Yes! Put me on your list for a portion of my harvest! Let's go! Everything that's here is for them up there! Bravo! Me, too. I have the right to speak. Andonis, before you give anything, go check what you have left to give. And maybe you won't need to rent my oil press. Go see if you have any olives left to press. Understand what's happening. Understand what he's doing. Ask the saintly shepherd what his friends were busy doing... while he was serving you with empty words! - What were his friends doing? - Father! - Ask him! - But... I don't know! Well, I'm going to tell you. The apostles Peter and James... - were stealing all my provisions. - Father! I caught red-handed... Yannakos and Kostandis. And there was a third apostle... a third thief. I saw him slipping around my barrels and my baskets... so pitful and so ashamed. And I'll tell you something. I was more ashamed than he was, because... the third thief... That thief... was my son. So am I lying? Just a moment, shepheard. Don't you have antyhing to say? You have nothing to say? God bless those thieves. You're just a rebel! A false prophet, an anti-Christ! And you're a bad priest. Go away, you are expelled! I told you you'd get cholera! Well, you got it! The cholera of heresy, the cholera of rebellion. Go away! I excommunicate you! I expel you from my church! Father Grigoris, you Church is small. God's world is big. Don't touch him - anyone! I will curse anyone who gives that man a hand! Curse me! I forbid you! I just understood something. If Jesus come back to Earth, He would be crucified again. And you'd be the one driving the nails in! Come, Manolios! This will be the end. I have to follow him. Please, my lord, get to bed. No. I want to see my son. Michelis... my son... my boy. He's afraid to lie down. He said that death will come for him in bed. It's okay. May I came in? Why not? So it's true, old friend. - You're kicking the bucket. - Yes. It's my Grand Exit. - Are you in such a hurry? - Not me. Some raki. Delicious... macerated blackberries. It will enchant your mouth. Don't you want some? Too late. I'm waiting for Father Grigoris. I'll never have time to confess all my sins to him. Where are you going? How would I know? According to your religion... I'm going straight to hell! Look how funny this is. For having lived exactly like you, my religion promises me heaven. A heaven of raki, of pilas, of many pleasures. What if both of our religions are telling us stories? Then fill up two glasses. Are you sure? Time's running out. Have a good journey, Patriarcheas. Come, Michelis My son. I ran as fast as I could. Father, I never wanted to hurt you. I know. The keys... the keys. They're yours. Everything is yours. My young lord Michelis... now you are rich. Very rich. Help me to bed. You killed him, Michelis. Everything I own... the houses, the fields, the vineyards, the livestock, everything... I hand everything over to the people from the Sarakina. Here's the deed. I'll get it legalized. If you cry, I'll start crying, too, and you have other things to do. Well... Go up to the Sarakina. Bring them all back. First, we have to give them shelter and food. Go on! You think that's naive? No, Michelis, I think it's great. - Really? - Really. Unbelievable. Incredible. You're crazy... Michelis, you've lost your mind. I'm not talking to the priest... but to the chief of the Council. - I'm asking you to legalize this dead. - Your houses would be in ruins... and your lands would lie fallow before I'd ever do that! You're a man of God. - It's Christ who... - What Christ? Your shepherd? I read in the Gospel to keep His word. I knew this book by heart before you were born... and you want to teach me? Try to understand me. Poverty moves me as much as it does you. And I don't like injustice any more than you do. But I'm warning you, Michelis, don't provoke disorder! Disorder is anarchy, and anarchy is the enemy of the Church! The Church will defend order against you, against... - But... - Let me finish! Shut up! Your father is dead now. And someday, you'll have to pay for the pain you caused him. Let me finish! Now you're the lord of the town... you own all its wealth. But if you waste it, you'll cause harm to everyone! - I'm free to... - No, you're not free to... to ruin the town, to spread disorder. "You'll sell your goods. You'll give your money to the poor. Then you'll gain eternal life!" My land is theirs. They're on their way. Not one pound! Not one grain of wheat! They are not to set foot in town! Don't try to stop them. - Here's another customer! - Step right up! Sit down, Father. Magnificent! When we carry you at the head of the procession, you'll look like a king! Hey, come over here. You aren't going to parade with us dressed like that. Pull up your pants... There you go. Isn't that better? - You're a landowner! - What does that mean? - It means that you have land in the sun. - I don't want to be a landowner! Listen! Don't go down there! Father Grigoris is stirring up the village! Don't go down there. You won't get the land! - The land is mine! - No. The Council declared you crazy. Tonight they will put the seals on everything you own. - What about the town? - Grigoris convinced them. He says that since these people come, we've been showered with bad luck. And you? What did you say? - Nobody asked me anything. - You're part of the Council. - Please, I just came to let you know. - It's not enough! I couldn't do more than I did. I came right away. Please, don't go down there. Blood will flow! It was too good to be true. I shouldn't have said anything until I was sure. No, my son. No matter what happens, your good intentions will live on. They will be taken into account. And will the intentions of the village be taken into account also? They want us to die. - May God forgive them. - Don't talk about God. Talk about men instead! Talk about wolves, monkeys! Don't be scared, I'm not crazy! I'll tell you: Yesterday, looking at our children with their skinny legs and extended stomachs, we thought that the town would feel compassion when they saw them. So we took them down there, to beg. Go on. Tell them how they treated us. No. They grabbed sticks to chase them away. Someone who was probably afraid of God threw them some crumbs. Only one person felt any pity. Do you know who? The Agha! When he saw them from his balcony, he started to laugh and he said... "They're like little monkeys. Feed them. We're going to make humans out those little monkeys. " Father Fotis... we never asked any questions. We always followed you everywhere, through everything. But now... we can't take it anymore! Forgive us, Father. Get up! You're a man, aren't you? A man is living being. He gets up and asks questions! Ask God why! If we let children starve to death, I think we sin against God. He's right. That man give us life. And people down there want to take it back from us! "I did not come to bring peace... but a sword!" Those were Christ's very words. He thought what you just said, Loukas. Pick up your sickes and your slinks. Get your sticks and your stones. We're going down! All they're asking for is some food! Go away! Leave! Leave! The land is theirs! Let them through! Leave, I said! Forward. Stop! Stop! This is horrible! We're all brothers! Stop! We are all Greek! Stop! Don't go there! They'll slaughter you! They're going to kill you! Don't go there! Shame, Grigoris! Mama! My eye! Go over the roof - then you can open the storeroom. Father Fotis... Loukas! Follow me. Poor brother... Poor fool. The barrels. Quick, go! Careful, the gate. No more deaths! One head is enough for me. Follow me! Stay with us. Your place is here. Your place is with me. Yes. Forever. But we have friends in the village. I'm going to get them. See you soon. Hey, don't get into that! Go away. Don't come bothering me. It's all your fault. Michelis isn't crazy - you are. Leave me alone. It's none of my business. It's more your business than mine. Those men were killed more by poison than by bullets - the poison of rebellion. If you don't stop it in this little village... the poison will spread. It will contaminate everything. What will you say when it gets to Constantinople, and you're blamed for it? - You worm, are you threatening me? - Yes. Get this rebellion under control. Otherwise, you'll pay for it. What do you want me to do? I want the culprit. Give us Manolios. Here's some chicken. - What do you want? - Come out here! I want to speak to you! Hurry, or this machine will speak for me. And don't be a hero, or I'll cut off your ears. Don't go. Manolios, don't go! Don't touch him. Grigoris wants you. And I'll take you to him, if you don't listen to me. What am I supposed to do? I'm just an old Turk and politician... But I can see things. If you do what I tell you, you're safe. If need be, I'll make sure of it myself. I'll be safe, but what about them? Will they fight without me? No, bright boy, without you, they'll stop. Just go tell them that you made a mistake. Or you were fooled. They'd put things in your head, but now you see clearly. Why spill blood? Do that, and you can go. Go on, now. I'll take care of the others! Cover the machine gun! - Hide! - Loukas! Loukas! Take him to the village! Stop! They don't know what they're doing! On your knees, all of you. Let's pray. O Lord, here he is at Your feet - the excommunicate! He stole, burned, killed... spread discord in a united town... separated an engaged couple... and rised hatred between father and son. There's blood on his hands. Judge this man, Almighty god... and shed the light of Your justice on us. My Katerina. You're in pain, aren't you? Listen to me. Listen carefully. Yes, Manolios. Go get Michelis. Quick! Tha Agha is sending reinforcements. Look for weapons. Follow Katerina. You're got to help them. They have rights, Katerina. I'm dying. But don't tell them. What should I tell them? That I will join them. Father Fotis! Thay're from the town. They're on our side. Thanks you! Thank you! Don't think the entire town is against you. More people are coming! And Manolios? He'll join us. He told me. Father Fotis, is Manolios dead? Listen to this story. One day, an angel come to Earth. The devil assaulted him and cut him in half with his sword. Instantly, there were two men. The devil assaulted them, and the angels became four. Every time the devil attacked, the angels multiplied. They can't kill Manolios. Manolios is what's best in us. And what's best in us can never die. Ready?
