What do we got here? Driver says the kid just came out of nowhere. Couldn't stop the car if she tried. Oh my God. Oh, Jesus Christ. What? What do you mean what? Why is the boy naked? Come on! Let's go! C'mon, give me my phone back. Max, I'm just giving your sister a little something to think about. Whoo. Damn right it's a little something. Shut up, fool. Give it back, c'mon. Oh, hey, and make sure you tell your sister and her little titties to call me, you hear? Give it back, man, c'mon. Hey! It's enough. Give him his phone back. Make me. I said give him his phone back. What? What! Whoa. Hey! Hey! Hey! C'mon! Hey! Hey! Break it up. What the hell is going on here? Huh? Save it for Friday, all of y'all. You're sure as hell gonna need it. Brandon, get over here. What did we just talk about? Huh? Did you forget? Don't get all caught up in that mess. Yes, sir. There's a time and place for everything. Alright? Now, smart guys, they don't waste time. Be smart. Yes, sir. You know? Don't be a sucker. You got me? No, look. You got me? Do you want me to make you dinner? Make me dinner? I can make you a nice piece of steak. Oh, yeah? You've been a bad girl, haven't you? I don't mean to be. Let's just go get ready, okay? Teddy and the boys are coming. Go get ready, okay? Okay. Mom's pissy you didn't call. What's new? Just telling you. You know she doesn't like it when you ride your bike at night. Makes her nervous. Ellie, she's always nervous. Well, she'll absolutely lose her shit if something happens to you. You and your friends ever talk about Jimmy? What's to talk about? Does Brandon ever bring him up? Not to me he hasn't. God, I can't imagine what they've been through. What? Did I say something? What. ? With your feet in the air And your head on the ground ? ? Try this trick and spin it Yeah ? ? Your head will collapse ? ? But there's nothing in it And you'll ask yourself ? ? Where is my mind? ? ? Where is my mind? ? ? Where is my mind? ? ? I was swimmin' In the Caribbean ? ? Animals were hiding Behind the rocks ? ? Except the little fish ? ? But they told me, he swears Tryin' to talk to me, coy koi ? ? Where is my mind? ? ? Where is my mind? ? ? Where is my mind? ? ? Way out in the water See it swimmin' ? You want to be a winner, don't you? So focus. Get in a zone, block everything out. Is anyone here? Pull all that bad crap that's in your head and throw it away. Forget about it. It's all about control. You understand? Control. I hear you out there. You better be careful with that. That shit will sneak up on your ass. Trust me. I know. Fuck me. Man, what the hell. Fucking hate this one sheet bullshit. I mean c'mon. Goddamn. No wonder them goddamn French bastards use them bidets. You know what a bidet is, darling? I can't really hear what you're saying. A bidet! B, A, D, A, Y. It's French. It's like a fancy water fountain for your asshole. You ever been to France? I've been to Paris, Texas. Oil rigs out there look like the Eiffel Tower. Well. Here in Richland I don't think you're gonna find anything fancy in these parts. I've found you, didn't I? Mm. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck it. I ain't looking for anything fancy anyway. Oh. Oh, for fuck's sake. Yep. What is it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, tell-- tell Mamo I-- Listen, you scrawny lizard. I got it. I'm looking right at it. Well, I'll be there when I'll be there. You know the louder you talk the less I listen, right? Okay. Okay. Well listen to this then. You got siblings? I fucking hate siblings. Hey! One, two... - Three! - Come on! You did good, man. - Come on, get up! Get up! - Come on, Brandon! You got this! You got this. Let's go! Get up! Get up! Come on, Brandon, you got this, let's go! You got this! Let's go! Come on, Brandon! Come on! Hey, Ellie. Whoa. You're looking rough. Thanks. How's that arm? It still works. Kinda. You gonna let people sign it? You know, like your own little yearbook? Maybe. You got a marker? Uh... Yeah. Wow. You're quite the artist. I saw the match. Wish you hadn't. Yeah, well. Max said that Robinson guy's a real nut job anyway. Meaner than a rattlesnake. Apparently, he like sent his own dad to the hospital twice. Yeah, he's a character. Uh, did you want paper or plastic? Hello, Brandon. - Did you want paper or plastic? - Uh... Sorry. Plastic. Plastic's fine, yeah. Oh, shit. Dammit. Need some help, sweetheart? No. I appreciate it. You don't have to do this. I broke my arm before. Twice, actually. Twice in eleven months, so I know what you're going through. Jeez. You don't seem like the clumsy type. I'm not clumsy, I'm just unlucky I guess. Unlucky, huh? Hey, did you faint? When you broke it? I know I did. Both times. It was like someone poured a bucket of black paint over my eyelids and I just completely blacked out. It was scary. No, I was actually in too much pain to faint. I kinda felt like somebody cracked my arm with a baseball bat. So... - God, it's awful. - Yeah. I would have fainted. Hey, you got a light? Uh, yeah, actually. - Here you go. - Thanks. I saw you the other night, you know. You sure? Mm-hm. Maybe you made a mistake. People make mistakes all the time. I don't think so. Hm. Well... See you around, I guess. Alright, yeah. Thanks for your help again. See you around. Hi. Hi. What's your name? Brandon. Brandon. I like you, Brandon. I do. What do you say? You want to make some easy money? Easy money? It depends. You know that gas station down near the highway? Yeah, the one on Franklin? Uh-huh. Yeah, what about it? Want to meet me there on Friday at 10? You want to rob the place? No, silly. I just need a ride to a friend's place and someone to watch me for a bit. That's all. Sounds like you're good at watching people. You don't have a car? Wouldn't be asking you if I did now, huh? How much? Fifty bucks? It's an expensive ride from the gas station. It's easy money, baby. Alright. Alright. See you around. "Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living. We shall squeeze you empty and then we shall fill you with ourselves." Thank you, Ellie. Now, can you all imagine a society that is hell-bent on destroying every bit of your will and sense of reasoning? Your rational thought, completely gone. Smashed. Down the toilet. I don't know. I mean this book kinda just left me feeling like frustrated and sad. I don't wanna think that... Love has to be stronger than this, than death or desire. It just can't be directed or controlled like some game. Love is its own law. Orwell certainly wants us to confront our own definitions. Our own mortality. And our rules. Brandon, what do you think? Brandon? Umm. Yeah, it's strange. Definitely. It makes you think... When do you really go over that edge? Yeah. When is enough really enough? Yeah. Because like it or not, we all have our own breaking point. Hey, Ellie! Hey, wait up. Hey, uh, by any chance, can you put in a word for me at that grocery store? Yeah, of course. No problem. Yeah, I'm just trying get some jobs. Save some money, you know, try to get the hell out of here. Where are you trying to go? As far as my truck will take me. Maybe El Paso or something. - Oh, really? El Paso? - Yeah. They got oil fields out there so... Maybe work on an oil rig or something. No, yeah. I have family in El Paso. So it's actually pretty nice there. Okay. Yeah. Listen, Brandon. Uh... I've been meaning to ask you. I saw you talking to that girl. What girl? In the parking lot? Do you know her? Oh, no. Nah. Not really. Okay, well, she's nuts. Like absolutely crazy. We caught her the other day stealing meat, of all things. - Meat? - Yeah. She went bat shit crazy when Jerry grabbed her and then started like screaming and yelling all of this nonsense, like, you should've seen her. She's trouble, Brandon, like with a capital T. I guess just like be careful... Watch it, assholes! - You alright? - Yeah, no. I'm fine. - Thank you. - Yeah. You know I don't get you guys. What do you mean? I always tell Max that wrestling is so stupid. I don't know why you guys do it. Like spitting in cups all the time and starving yourselves and wearing those gross suits or uniforms or like whatever you call'em. Singlets. Yeah. Whatever. It's stupid. All of it. Kinda is. Um, I got to get going but what are you doing this weekend? I work. What time do you get off? Uh, eight, I think. Okay. Do you want to maybe catch a movie? I can pick you up. You know maybe grab a bite or-- I don't know. Talk about how stupid wresting is. Yeah, sure, I'd like that. Just, hey, promise me you won't show up wearing that singlet thing. - Singlet? - Yeah, don't do that. Don't wear that. - Alright. No singlet. Pick you up at eight. - Okay. Cool. - Alright. - Bye. Alright. Alright. Boo. - Hi. - Hey. Honestly, I didn't think you were going to show up. Uh, you said easy money so... Sure, did. Um, where am I taking you? Where's your friend? Oh, it's on Shipley, just get on the highway going North, it's your first exit and it's about 15 minutes away. You never did tell me your name. Well, that's because you never asked. It's Pearla. Pearla? My mom's name is Pearla. Really? I bet she's a lovely lady then. Far from it. Just because you got a pretty name don't make you lovely. Guess that's true. Never met another Pearla though. Oh, we're around, you just got to know where to find us. Do you mind? Go ahead. Damn. I hate cops. I really fucking do. They take everything, you know. They just take it all. Even your soul, like the devil. That's the truth. What's that? Why, you want some? Hey, take a right right here. Up here? Umm-hmm. Don't worry, I won't be long. Here, put your number on my phone. Why? In case I need you. Need me for what? To come get me. If I text you the number 2, come get me right away. Otherwise, I'll be back in a half an hour. Hopefully, less. Half an hour? What are you, a hooker or something? A hooker? What kind of question is that? It's not very nice. Well, are you? I don't know. I help people sleep at night. That's all. - Here, take this. - Jesus, Pearla, what the hell is that for? Well, you might need it. You never know who's wondering around these parts. You ever used one before? Yeah, of course. Well, good thing. I'll be back in 30 minutes, but if I'm not, come get me. Keep checking your phone. You dirty dog. Don't say nothing. Alright. Don't say nothing until I ask you, okay? You got me? You got me? Yeah, I got you. You got your clothes off and you got the shorts on? - Now what do you want me to do? - Don't say anything. I asked you not to say anything. Okay, can you turn around? Yeah, I wouldn't exactly like that. More like a twitch. A muscle twitch. Kinda like when you're drifting off to sleep and you can still sorta hear and know what's going on around ya. But funny thing is you don't know if it's for real or made up or just a dream. And, all of the sudden, you feel yourself falling into a deep hole. All you can do is kick yourself awake. When you do wake up, everything is just foggy. Been so long ago now sometimes I don't know whether it's the truth or I'm just making things up now. - How old were you? - Ten. All I can remember is touching his toes. Seeing if he would move. He just laid there. Stiff as a board. - And your momma never remarried? - Nope. She raised all six of you boys, huh? She did. It wasn't easy. Wasn't easy at all. Funny the way life works. People would walk in and out of it... Some people are just harder to forget than others. When you've seen enough of it, you can't help to think you owe people something. Especially to the dead. Oh, my God. Come on. Let's go. Are you kidding? - That was your wrestling coach? - Yes! Fuck. It was my fucking coach. Crazy world, isn't it? God dammit. I can't fucking believe that shit. Oh, man. What the fuck are you laughing about? What's so funny? Is that funny to you? Stop! What are the chances? What are the chances of what? That I'm fucking driving a whore around town? What are the chances of that shit? I'm not a fucking whore, Brandon. You have no idea what you are talking about. - I'm sorry. - You have no idea! I didn't mean to, alright. I wasn't laughing at you. I was just laughing. Alright, I'm taking you home. No! What do you mean no? There's two more stops, I can't. No. No. No. I'm not doing two more stops, alright? Please. It won't be as long, okay? It will just be 15 minutes for both. In and out. And, hey, I'll make it a hundred. Alright, fine. Fuck. Easy fucking money, yeah. Don't you worry about getting hurt doing all this? No. Then why do you have that gun? I got other things on my mind, baby. And other things to worry about. Hey, Brandon, do you like bees? - Bees? - Yeah, bees. You know like, bzzzz... I don't know, I never really thought about it I guess. Well, did you know that only female honeybees die after they sting you? No. It's true. They have these stingers and they're like two shafts and they're lined with these barbs-- kinda like, kinda like a fishhook. And when she stings you, her stinger goes deep into your skin. But she can't pull it back out because of the barbs. She's stuck. Poor honeybee rips her guts out in the process... And then she dies when she flies away. Jesus. Sounds terrible. But when she dies she sends out this alarm pheromone. And all the other bees in the area just go crazy instead. - Is that right? - Yeah. What about the male bees? What about'em? Don't they die? They can't sting. Doesn't seem fair. No, it doesn't. Doesn't seem fair at all. But they die from other things. It's Oz. Papa. What the fuck took you so long? - My phone was at the bottom of my purse, I was... - Shhh. Shhh. Shhh. Shut that pretty little mouth. So? Three tonight. When are you gonna be back? Tomorrow. With the twins? Maybe. Did Teddy have to go in, sugar? No. Um... We got two more of those. Good. Hey, put Teddy on, would you? Teddy's not here. Teddy's not there? Who the fuck's drivin' you then? Um... Brandon. Who the fuck is Brandon, huh? What happened to Teddy, buttercup? What the fuck happened to Teddy? I don't like Teddy. Oh, you don't like Teddy? Well, I can't wait to meet this Brandon. Since you don't like Teddy, I can't wait to meet this Brandon. Who the fuck is he? - Who the fuck is Brandon? - He's... Who the fuck is Brandon? Who the fuck is this Brandon? Who the fuck is Brandon? Who the goddamn fuck is Brandon? Is everything alright? Is that another one of your friends? Can you just turn on Main Street and take me home instead? Yeah. Yeah, sure. He's always like that. Who's always like that? Oz. Hey, Pearla, are you going to be alright? Seriously. Yeah. It's really sweet of you to care about me, Brandon. It's really sweet... Here you go. Just like I promised. Easy money. Hey, you want to go dancing with me? What? Come on. Let's go dancing. Are you serious? I've never been more serious in my whole life. ? I was born in the evening ? ? Another lonely day ? ? And I wonder If my old man knew ? ? That I'd turn out this way ? ? And so I tried to play Every card on there ? ? What more can I do? ? ? Life ain't all that easy ? What can I get for you two? Um... Just two beers. Are you old enough, sweetie? Well, of course, he is, darling. Shit. Who even cares? Pearla, is-- Is Oz your pimp? That's his name, right? Oz. Well, some people call him Oswald. Like his granddaddy. But most people call him Oz. I call him whatever he wants me to call him. Is he my pimp? He is what he is. Thanks. You been here before? Nuh-uh. I have always wanted to. I've driven by a bunch of times but I never stepped in. I used to dance a lot when I was a little girl. Me and my best friend, we would-- you know, put on these outfits and put together these little dance routines and we would just dance and spin and spin and spin around until we fell down and just do it over and over and over again. It was-- It was silly but it was fun. Where was that? Wills Point. A total shithole. Couldn't get out of there fast enough. Yeah. I know the feeling. Can't wait to leave this hell hole. Really? Yeah. I heard there's good money to be made out in El Paso. Working on the oil rigs out there. Rough-necking it. It's where I'm headed. Hey, how about taking me with you? What, you wanna go? Yeah, I do. Yeah, sure, why not? You promise? I mean I'm serious, I'll help pay for gas and everything. Okay. Yeah. Promise. Hey, don't make a promise you can't keep. I'll let you know when I hit the road. When's that? I don't know. Pretty soon. Well, to El Paso then. To El Paso. Don't you always hear about people dying on jobs like that like working on the oil rigs and stuff, isn't... Yeah, I mean, any job is dangerous, all right? You can die doing anything. You should know that. Yeah, I should. Do you want to have kids, Brandon? What? No. I don't mean with me. I just mean one day. I wanna have kids. I want to have two or three. I mean, hell, if I had enough money, I'd have four. I didn't grow up with brothers and sisters and I so wished that I did. Someone to look out for you or steal clothes from. Someone to cry with. I just don't think it's right, you know? Having a kid and being all on their own. It's just so lonely. Right? It's just... Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. I babble a lot when I'm nervous. Why are you nervous? Because I like you. I love this song. ? Won't come down Till we're older ? ? Tattoo your name On my shoulder ? ? I don't care What people say ? ? I could dream my life away ? ? Under your skin ? ? Under your skin ? ? Tap off feet to the temple ? ? I will never want to let go ? ? I'm stuck to you Like a shadow ? ? Maybe we could ride The full moon ? ? Float to the night On a harpoon ? ? Whistle The mockingbird's tune ? ? Think of ourselves To be bolder ? ? Won't come down Till we're older ? ? Tattoo your name On my shoulder ? ? I don't care What people say ? ? I could dream my life away ? ? Under your skin ? ? Under your skin ? ? Whistle The mockingbird's tune ? Hey, did you mean it about El Paso? I'd leave tomorrow if I could. Well, what's stopping you? I don't know. I guess I just started thinking about it more and more. Well, you let me know when you get going, okay? You promised. A man's only got his word, right? I had fun tonight. I really did. More fun than I have had in a long while. You know in a perfect world we'd all be dancing all the time. Wouldn't that be something? Maybe in El Paso. Where you've been? Out. Is that right? I know where you've been. You've been screwing that dirty whore, haven't you? - What the hell are you talking about? - Shut up. You shut the fuck up, you little fuck. I'm talking here. You don't think I know? Patsy. Patsy fucking Lee. - Why are you like this? - Don't you walk away. You don't get it, huh? You think you're a man now. - Think you got a big swingin' dick? - Stop saying that. You're not a man. Nuh-uh. You know what you are? You're a fucking loser. Your stupid daddy's a freakin' loser. And you're a loser. It's in your blood, boy. Loser blood. And you ain't never gonna run away from that. No matter how many whores you fuck! You lost your fucking mind, you know that? You don't know what you're talking about. You don't know shit. I know shit! I know your fucking girlfriend's a piece of shit-- What the hell did I ever do to you, huh? Why you hate me so much? I don't hate you! I just can't stand you! Yeah? Well, I'm not him, okay? I'm your fucking son. No, you ain't. I lost mine! I lost mine, dammit! Get the hell outta here! I don't want you here anymore. Just get out! Fine!

Fine, you got what you fucking wanted! - You're the fucking loser of this family. - Get out! - Yeah, I'm out of here. - Get out! Get Out! Brandon. Coach. About last night-- What about last night? Uh, with the girl. I just wanted to say... There was no last night, Brandon. I got no idea what you talkin' bout. Last night? Yeah, I do know that we could've used you today. Yes, sir, we coulda. Hey, how's the arm coming? Uh, it's all right. Good, good. You'll be better in no time. Just a little bit of bad luck. We all get bad luck now. Sometimes it just depends on how you deal with it. Yeah. Hey, you know, you're welcome to come help the fellas out-- Help me out if you want to. Anytime. Thanks, coach, yeah, I appreciate it. I just got some stuff I got to sort out. Get my act together and stuff. Hey, we all gotta do what we gotta do. You know. That's part of becoming a man. Doing things you don't want to do sometimes. Taking care of business. Your mom okay? Mm? Good. Yeah. Take care of her. Mom's important. Alright. Hey, Ellie, I guess you're still at work right now, but I figure I'd try ya. Just want to make sure you're still on for tonight. Anyways, hope you're doing good. This is Brandon. If you couldn't guess. Anyways-- Alright. I'll see you later. Come in quick. You alright? Jesus, Pearla, what happened to you? Who did that to you? He didn't like you driving me. Christ, Pearla. There's a lot you don't know. Hey, you can go to the police. No. I can't. No, I can't. - I can't. I can't go to the police. - Alright. Alright. Alright. Don't touch me! Whoa, whoa. Hey. Alright, I was just trying to help, alright? I'm not doing nothing, alright? You think you're so fucking smart, Brandon, don't you? You think you're so fucking smart, you think you know everything? You don't. No, Pearla, I don't. Just put the gun down, alright? You're scaring me. Just want to help. - You're calling the police, aren't you? - No. - You're calling the police! - What are you talking about? No, I swear to God I'm not calling any cops or nothing. I'm not talking to anybody. Please just-- Just calm down. Good, keep it that way. Pearla, what the fuck are you doing? Pearla, please just put the gun down, okay? Hey. I'm sorry.

You know I hate seeing you like this. Your sister hates seeing you like this. - You're lucky your daddy ain't around to see you like this. - Shit. What the hell was I supposed to do, huh? Keep your dick in your pants, maybe start with that. I don't know, find a nice girl for a change. Come on, Mamo. You know me. I'm like a bloodhound, I'll sniff the bitch out. She can't be that hard to find. And I'll find those bitch motherfuckers. And hit them with your busted hand? Is that what you're going to do? Hey, it ain't my shooting hand. Just give me my shit. That's all I care about. Every single-- - I'm telling you! - You didn't tell me that, babe! Oh my God. Every single time. Goddamn. So you're Brandon? Go ahead, Brandon, look at what you did.

People can hear you! Well, you couldn't. Jesus Christ! I was asleep. How many times do I have to tell him I said I'll be ready! You lucky I don't have time to come in here and stick my dick in your mouth. You're a disgusting pig. You're lucky I don't tell Oz. Tell him what, bitch? What are you going to tell him? What are you going to tell Oz, huh? What? Tell him how fucking stupid you are. I'm not fucking stupid. Come here, bitch! Get off me! Get off me! What? - What the fuck was that? - Just leave. - Please just leave. - Who the fuck's in there? - Teddy, just leave! Get off now! - Sit your five-dollar ass down. Hey! Leave her alone now! I'm serious, man. I called the cops. They'll be here any minute. Yeah? Well, that was real damn dumb. Cause see now we all gotta go. No, Teddy, please. Arrghh! Well, well, well. Papa, please, please, don't hurt him. Hi. Oh, yeah. You know. The problem these days is that families just don't have supper together no more. You know? Ain't that right, Teddy? That's right, Oz. Yeah. We don't sit around the table to break bread. No. We're just all about ourselves being selfish. Yeah. On our phones or watching TV or whatnot, we just don't make time for each other. Well, not in this family. See, in this family we make time for one another. Ain't that right, buttercup? Yes, papa. Goddammit, you are a good-looking son of a bitch, Brandon! Yes, you are. And you know there was just a whole lot of sweet young pussy out there, ain't there? Oh, there's a lot of it. Oh, a lot of it. I mean if I was you, I would be fucking every little bunny that bounced my way. Every fucking bunny. Every fucking bunny until my goddamn dick fell off. Oh, Brandon, but I ain't you. No. No. Because I am just a big old fucking faggot. Mm-hm. You know what us big fucking queers get, baby? Yeah. We don't get no sweet young pussy. We get... Hemorrhoids. Fucking hemorrhoids. Oww. Oh, well. Brandon, if you are going to be a part of this family, first off-- When somebody puts food on your plate, you eat that shit. I mean you eat that motherfucker. You eat that food in front of you. You eat that motherfucker! You fucking eat it and you like it! Secondly, you don't play with other people's toys. No, no, no, you do not do that. Well, not without permission. You certainly need to ask and you need to ask very politely. You didn't ask permission. Did you, Brandon? No, Brandon didn't ask permission. That's a very bad thing. A very bad thing, Brandon. When people in this family do bad things... Do you know what they get? Get up, motherfucker! When people do bad things in this family, you know what they get? No. Yeah? A little kiss from me. Yummy. And a warning. When we keep doing bad things in this family, you know what happens to us? No. We die. Stop it! Stop it! You got to let him go! He didn't do anything! Leave her alone! Leave her alone! You don't get to tell me what the fuck to do! You're the little piece right here now! You're the little fucking bitch, you understand? Hey, Teddy, what do you want to do with this little bitch? - Let's break his other motherfucking arm. - No, no, no! - Break his other arm. - Break his arm. - No! Please... - Break his arm.
