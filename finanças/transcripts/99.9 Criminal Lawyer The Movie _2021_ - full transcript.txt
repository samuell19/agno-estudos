It was a month ago that I met Master Miyama. On my first job as a defense counsel. In the dusty fields of Kesennuma, my first ever re-enactment. My first experience of being chased by a truck driver trying to expose the offender. Yo, I'm trying to rhyme, but I'm hitting a bump. I'm number one. I am. Be my master. I've been with Miyama for 15 years. I, Akashi, am his best partner ever. I'm the only one who deserves to be Miyama's partner. Honoka Kono? You're just a manga-loving rookie lawyer. I won't let you be Miyama's partner, not while I'm around. You were following me! I won't let you! Splash. Okay, cut. No good. That's not the motive for assaulting the victim. Follow the script. - I couldn't help myself. - What? - I couldn't help myself. - What? I know you can hear me. You're taking your time. Something's odd. What is? From the situation, I thought so too, Master. Stop that manga talk. Command silence. It's rocky here, so you make noise as you walk. The police say that Mr. Kaga followed Mr. Higashino and assaulted him. But Mr. Higashino would've noticed Mr. Kaga following him. Which means? Mr. Kaga, one month ago, on May 3rd, it says you shoved Sota Higashino off Furigake Cliff in Kanagawa. You're being charged with murder. Please. On the day he died, you followed Mr. Higashino on his way home. Then assaulted him on the cliff. You were both in the same fishing association. You two fought over fishing territory. But I wouldn't kill him over that. He told me to come, so I was waiting when he suddenly attacked. He'd been threatening me for a while now. I'd even filed a complaint to the police. But they wouldn't do anything about it. You're saying it was self-defense? Yes, I was just fighting back. I didn't mean to kill him. I know you won't believe me now, but I'm not lying. You gotta believe me. My life depends on you guys now. Look into my eyes. Don't you see? Okay. So if Mr. Kaga was telling the truth... Mr. Higashino was waiting to ambush Mr. Kaga. But where? For example... Over there. You're right. You could hide here. And watch Mr. Kaga come. The perfect spot to ambush. Cigarettes? "Murder over fishing grounds!” The latest volume. Can't wait to read it! "Robot Lawyer B" The results are back from the research lab. They found the victim's DNA from cigarettes in the can. The cigarettes were the same brand that Mr. Higashino smoked. So he was smoking while he waited. Okay, Mr. Kaga's self-defense... The professor said doubt is the first step towards truth! - Shut up. - That's B's line. - Professor? - Professor Kaneko. - That was quick. - I read the manga too. So who is he? Good morning! I made it. What do you mean, a new witness? What is it? We just heard about it from the prosecution. What do you mean, a new witness? He's another fisherman from the same fishing association. He was standing here, on the bridge. And saw Mr. Kaga murder Mr. Higashino. Why didn't he come out and say it until now? He left the spot to dine with a friend he was indebted to. He felt guilty for just leaving and kept quiet because of it. If he's telling the truth, we have no chance of winning. Dining with a friend, huh? - Morning. - Good morning. Did you guys take on the Furigake case without my... You're already on it? - Old man's angry. - You're old, too. Are you complaining about us taking on a losing case? No, I didn't say that. You're complaining. I'm just asking for a reason. He's complaining. What's Rule Number 7 again? Call Grandfather if Mr. Sada is causing trouble for Master. Hey, stop it. Not in front of everyone, stop it. Stop it! That's not what I'm here to talk about. Look, besides this criminal case, Mr. Higashino's family is also filing a civil suit against Mr. Kaga. So what? The lawyer that took on this civil suit... is Kyohei Nagumo. Mr. Nagumo? That could mean it might affect our criminal case, too. You can claim for damage. You mean it? Maybe... What? To make sure Mr. Higashino is seen as a victim, maybe Mr. Nagumo prepared Mr. Mita as a new witness. To win the civil suit? He cooked up a witness for that? I wouldn't put it past him. He did the same with the Okabe case. Darn Nagumo. He'll never learn, huh? I've only seen a picture of him. You're not being followed? - How was it? - You idiot! What if someone sees us? Is this it? Yeah, sure. Is that it? You can at least say thanks. Not that you asked me to do this, but you got me curious. I'm busy as a Tokyo District Public Prosecutor now, you know. So Mr. Kaga really had filed some complaints. "I'll kill you" Yeah, but the police didn't do anything about it. So if it becomes known that the police didn't do anything, it could mean big trouble for the police. Which is why they made it seem like Higashino is the victim. If the police are trying to hide who the real victim is, this won't be an easy case to crack. "Furigake Cliff, Kanagawa Prefecture” It's almost 10:25, the time of the assault. You sure you can do it? - Yes! - Yes! Mr. Fujino, Ms. Nakatsuka, are you ready? - Yup! - We're ready! It's time! Akashi, witnessing the murder! - Hal - Huh? Mr. Higashino! Ms. Nakatsuka just fell off the cliff. I saw it clearly. But can we really prove that he didn't witness it? We're going to find out now. Okay, now hurry over. Can you really do it? - Yes! - So can I! - Then hurry. - OI' Akashi, let's go. Don't call me that. Texas is that way, huh? "Kumamoto Castle" Don't lag behind. There's Kumamon. Huh? Found it! Taxi! To the tavern Texas. Certainly. Hey, wait up! What the heck! "Texas" So Mr. Mita was here by 6 PM? He sure was. - Right at that table. - Here? He really liked our food. Then may I have the exact same dishes? Stop! Wait! I know you can see me. I can't pay for a cab. Here's today's card. What is that? Here you are. Horse sashimi and dago soup. Thank you for this award- whinny-ing food. Let's see. Plain and good. Good, huh? But... This black garlic sesame sour sauce. Put some of this here. Like this. Would you like some? Okay then. Dang, that's really good. I know, right? - Master, the time? - Welcome. 5:50 PM. I made it in time? Seems like it. So Mr. Mita would've been able to make it just like in his statement. Where's Mr. Akashi? Texas, here it is. This one is on the house. Thank you. Texas... What took you so long, Mr. Akashi? You left me behind! And the time? 6:15 PM. I got here at 5:50 PM. Then call me. I ran all this way from the station. Why are you guys eating, huh? That's not part of the re-enactment. Cool down, OI' Akashi. Stop calling me that. Master? The restroom is over there. "Kumamoto Akemi Matsuri" He told me to come, so I was waiting when he suddenly attacked. The perfect spot to ambush. So Mr. Mita was here by 6 PM? - He sure was. - Look into my eyes. Kumamoto Castle... Bearing good news? 7 points out of 100. Kumamoto Castle, bearing good news! - You have meat akami sashimi? - Yeah. - I'd like some. - Ok. Who's this? Akemi. Right, Akemi. My akami isn't here yet. I'm waiting for my akami with Akemi. What the heck? Waiting for akami with Akemi! You really think that's funny? "Courthouse” Miyama, look. You said you saw Mr. Kaga murder Mr. Higashino. And after that, you dined at Texas, a restaurant in Kumamoto. Is that correct? Yes, we'd set the date quite a long time ago. So what? To refresh the witness's memory, I'd like to show a map of Kumamoto Station and its surroundings. Go ahead. Here it is. The witness arrived at the train station at 5:45 PM. He arrived at Texas by 6 PM. We've already check all the airlines and know that he didn't fly to Kumamoto. How did you go to the restaurant, and by which route? I took a cab. I asked the driver to take the shortest route. Will you show us that route? Here. Your honor, I would now like to present our next evidence, a poster. Go ahead. This is a poster for a festival that was held on the day of the incident. So what? Please take a look at this part here. As shown here, road blocks were in place for the festival. This route that the witness just pointed out was blocked off during this time. And from 3 PM until 7 PM, there was an event with Akemi, which meant no cars could pass through. The witness couldn't have used that route. I just asked the driver to take the shortest route possible. I'm sure he took a different route to avoid it. Your honor, I would now like to present another map as evidence. This is the shortest route possible that avoids the road blocks. It's quite a detour. We tested it, and it takes at least 25 minutes. Meaning, he wouldn't have made it by 6 PM. I remember now. I tried to take a taxi, but decided to walk instead. Which means you walked at a pace of 9.99 seconds per 100 meters. The time? 6:15 PM. I ran all this way from the station. 9.99 seconds per 100 meters... You looked at the train's timetable and thought you'd make it. If you'd really witnessed a murder at Furigake Cliff, arriving at Texas in Kumamoto by 6 PM... would have been impossible. I rest my case. This is the fact! 99.9% of all criminal trials in Japan result in a guilty verdict. Being indicted is almost synonymous to being found guilty. This story is about lawyers who will do anything to arrive at the truth hidden behind the remaining 0.1%. "99.9 Criminal Lawyer The Movie" Mr. Mita had just started fishing and needed money. He was in conflict with Mr. Kaga, who wanted to keep his territory. Mr. Mita found out that Mr. Higashino, who owed him money, also hated Mr. Kaga. So he made Mr. Higashino attack him. So it was Mita that was threatening Mr. Kaga. - Of course, OI' Akashi. - Stop calling me that. He confessed to everything. But why did Nagumo cook up such a careless witness? Maybe he wanted us to figure out that Mr. Mita was lying. He wanted us to figure it out? Here's what I think. Mr. Kaga would've been able to prove he acted in self-defense. If Mr. Nagumo hadn't done anything, that would've been case closed. Because with Higashino dead, nobody else could've testified that Mita made Higashino do it. So Mr. Nagumo told Mr. Mita that without a witness, it would become clear that Mr. Kaga acted in self-defense and set him up as a witness. But as a result, it became clear that Mr. Mita was behind it all. In this way, Mr. Nagumo was able to protect Mr. Higashino's honor for his family. But that means you played right into Nagumo's hands. Guess so. Why are you smiling? Aren't you mad? But why would Nagumo go through all that for this? Who cares, now that the truth has been exposed? I bet Nagumo just wanted to fake a witness and failed. Huh? Is this Eri? Click that. Okay. - I thought so. - I have piano lessons. I have a competition coming up. Who's that? - Mr. Nagumo's daughter. - Really? Wow, she won the competition. Don't touch that. Congratulations on the Vienna International Competition. Thank you. Who do you wish to share your joy with? My father. He raised me all by himself. He got me started on the piano. I'm really grateful. When you won the grand prize... Excuse me. Mr. Kyohei Nagumo, right? I'm with Weekly Broth. Can we have a minute? No thank you. Does Eri know about her real dad? She's Takanobu Yamamoto's daughter, right? The man who poisoned four people to death 15 years ago... Where did you hear that from? What a violent lawyer. Shall I shout? The media is right there. Listen to me. If you dare to snoop around my daughter... I'll sue you. Sure. "Pianist winner, a former death row inmate's daughter” This is Weekly Broth. Can we chat a little? Mr. Nagumo, I know you're there. Come on. Ignore them. They're here for a case I'm working on... What is this? It's not real. Don't worry. Of course I'll worry! Then what was my real dad like? Liar. Eri, did you read the article? How do you feel? In your own words. Stop it! Please, go away! Stop it, we won't talk! Eri. Eri, wait. "Genius pianist's dad a death row inmate?" Don't stop it. - I don't like it. - Knock before you come in. So, what did you want? It's true about Eri's father. He was the defendant for the Tenkamura wine poisoning. At a festival on May 13, 2006, four people died drinking the wine that was served there. The article said he kept pleading innocent till the end. But he was given the death sentence. He died in prison after he was sentenced. And, I kid you not, the lawyer who worked this case was none other than Nagumo. "Kyohei Nagumo" You mean, he took in the death row convict's daughter? I don't know the details. Hello? Are you okay? Where are you? Sorry I'm late. - I'm sorry for calling so suddenly. - Not at all. You've gone through so much. I figured my father wouldn't tell me the truth. You're the only one I can depend on. Which is why I gave you my card. I don't know what to do. I can't believe my father was a Killer. But if we look into it, it might not be what it seems. Seems like both Nagumo and your father kept pleading innocent. You mean, my father might be innocent? Before... I told you that Nagumo and I had different views about being a lawyer. But all differences aside... He's definitely an excellent lawyer. If he believed in your father's innocence... I think he might be right. Would you be able to look into the case again? I want to know the truth. But it was 15 years ago. It's nearly impossible to overturn such an old ruling. But if you really want to know the truth... we'll do everything in our power. But in doing so, you'll have to understand, that you may face even tougher times. Do you still wish it? Yes, I do. I want to know what happened to my real father 15 years ago. What do you want? I don't have time. My firm has decided... to look into Eri's father's case. What? We'd like the case records. I refuse. You believed in Mr. Yamamoto's innocence, didn't you? Why didn't you lodge an appeal for a retrial? Because to do so... Eri, the only remaining family, had to do it. That would've meant telling her that her father was a death row convict. I couldn't do that without proof that could overturn the verdict. But Eri asked us to do this. - Eri did? - Yes, in all earnest. She's not as frail as you think. And just to let you know, Eri will be staying at my place for the time being. Don't worry, my wife and daughter are with her. "Defendant Yamamoto" Where's the footage? I'm getting it. Where'd it go? What now? You're really pumped. And you said you'd close this firm. You can't! I never said that. Calm down, it's fine. Hey Miyama. Just look at this here. - Where? - Here. - Where? - Here. Look. The judge was Mr. Kawakami? I know, right? I will continue to stand in your way. That kid's got courage. Just like how you used to. If Kawakami finds out we're filing a retrial, it could get ugly. Hey, you messed with my sign again. Are you okay? Where are you? Cut it out. Oh yeah, you're still trying to change the name of the firm? You are? No, I am not. Look. I'm changing the logo. But that means you want to change the name of the firm. Just get off my case. What? - I'm done. - Okay, let's check. Mr. Sada! May 1? Go for it. - Shut up. - Can you do it? Yes, I can. You sure? - Don't mess it up. - Come on. Mr. Nagumo took on the case because they went to college together. She's doing well. I can't see. Mr. Nagumo did all he could to prove Mr. Yamamoto's innocence. But the Supreme Court sentenced him to death. His wife, Sakiko, died from stress after the sentence. Mr. Yamamoto then died in prison. She's gotten better. Two reasons why he was found guilty. One, the poison used was a chemical used for growing grapes. It had been mixed into the wine barrel. Mr. Yamamoto had the chemical company make it especially for him. So nobody but him had access to it. But there wasn't enough poison in the victims' vomit to see if it was the same poison as the one in the barrels. But how could the poison in the victim and the poison in the wine barrel not be the same? If it wasn't the same, you can't say Mr. Yamamoto did it. Let's look for the person who analyzed the poison. Continue. Okay. The second reason was because of when the wine was poisoned. Footage of the festival was taken from the preparations. - Mr. Fujino. - Got it. There's footage? From 15 years ago? - Yes. - Real footage? Coming right up. I'm impressed they had it. One second. How's that? Hold on. If they had all that footage... "No questions from the counsel” - Mr. Fujino. - Hold on. There it is. Okay. The police analyzed the movements of the villagers by the minute. And came to the conclusion that only Mr. Yamamoto could have done it. What was his motive? He didn't really fit into the village, so they said it was resentment. But Mr. Yamamoto said he had no grudges toward the victims. According to Mr. Nagumo's notes, it says maybe the villagers were jealous of Mr. Yamamoto. Why? Mr. Yamamoto used to work for a company in Tokyo. But he moved to the village to make wine. They welcomed him at first, but after he won a prestigious wine contest, the villagers became cold. So they became jealous of him. Here's what happened the day of. The wine festival was scheduled for 1 PM. They started setting up in the morning. Mr. Yamamoto was in charge of fried chicken that day. Is that him? He's frying away. That's a lot. Hold on a second. This makes it a whole lot tastier. I can't see. He's doing a double-fry. He's frying it twice? Looks delicious. I can't see. It's about time. He'll come out before long. Mr. Nagumo? I saw him running that way. Go, get him! After him! Nice going. Let's go! Mr. Nagumo, it's Miyama from Madarame Law Office. I let myself in. What do you want? I gave Mr. Sada the records. Something in it piqued my interest. What? You called a witness to take the stand. But you didn't ask him anything. Ayumu Saraie, a wine wholesaler. "No questions from the counsel” Why didn't you ask him anything? It's unrelated to the case. That reminds me... Here's some tea. You don't cook, right? What's this about? That day, Mr. Yamamoto was double-frying the chicken. So? When deep-frying thick pieces of meat, if you cook it until it's completely cooked through, the surface gets all tough. To prevent that, you double-fry it. That makes it much tastier. What's this about? Would somebody planning to kill people be so intent on frying chicken so perfectly? By the way, you're taking care of Mr. Yamamoto's old house, right? I'd like to borrow the keys. I'll call you again. Thank you for the tea. I will now deliver the verdict. The defendant will be sentenced to death. Miyama, Kono, we're going to Tenkamura. Take me too. - Got the material? - Yeah. - The timetable? - Checked. There's only one train an hour. We have to get back today. - Then don't come. - I will go. - Take me too. - Shut up. I'll come in handy. - Shut up. - Mr. Wakatsuki? Yeah right, he wouldn't... Erase the board if you want to go. - Look. - Mr. Wakatsuki! Sorry for dropping in so suddenly. I came with a letter for Honoka. Actually, I came to see how my granddaughter was doing. You see, she's just on her way to meet with some important clients. She's so eager to go. The shy Honoka is being eager? I'm accompanying her. - Do not worry. - Grandfather. You're doing a great job, I see. A letter came for you to your old workplace. Wow, thank you. - Bye now. - Good luck. - Thank you! - I'm going too. Why you...? Mr. Miyama said you didn't have to go. He's taking Mr. Akashi instead. What the... You better pull your weight, OI' Akashi. Here we are. Nobody here. - "Tenkamura Winery" - There's nothing here. - "Tenkamura Winery" - There's nothing here. There's nothing but wine in this village. Here's the winery where it happened. It's still in use. Let me see. It's so fine today. The weather changes quickly in the mountains. This was Mr. Yamamoto's home and winery. Watch your step, Master. You too. Don't shove! The chemical was stored in this garage. OI' Akashi, get to work. Here's the key. It's so loud. Somebody would've heard. So nobody could've stolen the chemical while the wife was home. After the incident, Sakiko drove away from this garage in her car to the site. Let me see. Mr. Yamamoto kept the place neat, huh. "Do not leave open” The chemical used in the crime was stored in this locker. How big was Sakiko's car? It's a small van, so maybe this big? - Check the model and size. - Got it. Stop it, don't. Is that Eri and Sakiko? What's that? Seems like a wine making journal. Let's borrow this. What? Over here! - Uh oh. - What are you doing here? Hi, we have permission. Hello, I'm Miyama, a lawyer. We're looking into an incident that happened in this village. - What? - Let's leave. Cool down, B. Why so hot-headed? B? We don't like strangers barging into our village! We're not barging. Stop it. - Easy, Mr. Ota. - But Mr. Shigemori... The trial is over. But we have some doubts. The professor said... - Excuse me. - Professor? - What? - Were you all there when it happened? - Yeah. - Well then. Will you help us re-enact it? Did you not hear me? I did. You were there, right? I want to know the truth. Yamamoto did it, that's the truth. Leave the village, now. Okay, we're leaving. Why? Re-enacting is fun. - No, it's not. - It's really fun! - Come on. - It really is. I'm going to head over now. You know how hard it was, dealing with Mr. Wakatsuki? But he gave you a lot of work, right? Shut up. I'm right, huh? Dealing with him and getting work, it's... Excuse me! - He's after us! - Run! Are you listening? Why do you always... Stand back! I'm sorry about my father. - Your father? - Answer me! I'm Mamoru Shigemori. Can we talk? I was four when it happened. So I only remembering the adults being all worked up about something. But something's been weighing on my mind. Yes? Two years ago... my friend Keita said something strange when he left the village. The murderer. I don't think it was Mr. Yamamoto. Then who was it? I don't know. After that, he and his family left Japan, and I haven't been able to reach him since. I asked my dad about it. But... Don't go snooping around. Nobody in the village wants to be reminded of it. Got it? You're looking into the case, right? Yes. I'd like to help. I want to know what really happened. - Thank you for the food. - Thank you. Are you sure about me staying here? - Of course. - We love having you. Sorry we're so far away from the city. Which is what keeps the media away. You don't have to worry now. - Right, Kasumi? - Let's go to my room. - Kasumi. - Thank you. When did you start the piano? - Hey, Kasumi. - When I was five. Wow. Is she still mad about her birthday? Not just that. What? What's this? - "Give her the death penalty too" - Posts about Eri on the internet. Kasumi is angry about it all. - "She looks nice, but she's a murderer's daughter” - Eri did nothing wrong. So why's she mad at me? She's expecting you to help her. She wants you to hurry up and save Eri. I know. "Acting like a heroine in distress. Go to underworld” "Eri" Liar. Thank you. The script is here. ...and two wine barrels. What about the villagers who aren't here anymore? We need eight people. "Tenkamura Wine Festival script" - I'm back How was the lab? I met the person who did the analysis. So you couldn't determine that the poison in the victims' vomit was the same as what was in the wine barrels? Right, there was too little of it to conclude back then. But what about with today's technology? I think we could. I've actually kept a sample of it. - Unbelievable. - We could redo the analysis... - But what? - To do so... We'd need to use the latest Super Sei yan Ill that the US has. It's very costly to use. Can't we do that in Japan? "Amadeos" "Magbeth" Unbelievable. - Deputy leader. - Yes? Mr. Akashi, 15 degrees clockwise. 15 degrees clockwise. Nobody tells us what to do! - Mr. Fujino, got the camera? - All ready. And you get fried chicken. There we go. Hi, Honoka. I love getting to see you online. You couldn't come again, Mr. Sada? I would if I could. Hey, I can't see. Stop it, come on. Hey, I said stop it! Now! Turn the computer to the right. To the right? Okay. No, other way. Towards Miyama. - This way? - Yeah. - That's the left. - Whatever. Towards Miyama. Hello. What fine weather. You set all this up? The closer it is to reality, the closer we get to the truth. Thank you for your cooperation. Mamoru wished for it. Thank you. Let me introduce you. This theatrical company is here to help set up and to play the part of the victims. What's with the theatrical company? - All right. - Leader. Theatrical company? They must be actors. Duh. You're too close. I'm Kudo, the leader. She sells seashells by the seashore. She sells seashells by the seashore. We've studied the footage carefully. You can count on us. Terumoto, actor of 35 years. I've got enough passion to reach Broadway. - Enough of that. - What? Say all you want about me, but when it comes to our leader... Beware! - Enough of that. - Huh? Bad enunciation. How cruel. Thank you for saving my brother in Kesennuma. Kill 'em on the spot! - Thank you. - Sure. And thanks. The time is 12:30 PM. Okay everyone. You're done setting up, and it's time to carry in two wine barrels. All right! - Yeah! - I can't see. Don't stand there. - Okay. - Let's begin. Okay, start! Everyone, take your positions. - Take your positions! - Ok. - Ready? - Wine, two, wine, two. Wine, two, wine, two. Put your back into it. One wine barrel was taken into the winery. The other was taken to the front yard. Okay, that way. Hey, jumping the gun? I can't wait anymore. After setting the barrels down, a few sampled the wine. Those people were fine. Which means the wine wasn't poisoned when it was brought in. I see. You're too close. The village chief is coming. Akashi, coming in. Hi. Yamada, give him his happi coat. There. How do I look? I'm one of you now. I'm one of you now. The chief is here, so it's a bit early but let's head on over. The chief came early, so it started 10 minutes earlier than planned. They headed over to do the traditional breaking open of the barrel. Everyone headed into the winery. But Mr. Yamamoto was still frying the chicken. Ms. Uehara was frying the chicken with him. I'm at a crucial point, and I can't leave now. - You go on ahead. - Okay. Please re-enact that. I'm at a crucial point, and I can't leave now. You go on ahead, I'll stay behind. Okay. Mr. Yamamoto was alone from this point on. Let's go, Chief. Make sure you double-fry it. Please. - Hey, take us too! - Huh? - Take the computer with you! - Honoka! - Huh? I can't hear you. - Miyama! All right now. Thank you. Okay. Once again... We were able to have a fine harvest. Yet... we must not become idle. If we do, we will never win the international market. Once again, as a team, more decisively again, together all as one, let's work together! Everyone ready? Wine, two. Wine, two. Wine, two. I'm opening the barrel! Chief always made a joke first. A joke? - Didn't you read the script? - I'm not an actor. - Just do it! - Come on. Tell him to do it accurately. Accurately, please. That year, he hit the side of the barrel first. We all had a good laugh. Do it right. - Okay, fine. - Just do it. I'll do something funny. Not my fault. Stop it. Only the actors. Here I go. Let's serve the wine. Yeah! All right! I'm done double-frying the chicken. And Mr. Yamamoto joins them. During those seven minutes, only Mr. Yamamoto could've poisoned it. The blank time frame. Everyone got a glass? Okay, ready? Here's to wine! Here's to wine! And everyone went out to the front yard. Fried chicken... Fried chicken... Let's have a drink. Here we go. Here's to wine. I can't breathe! That's enough. Okay, cut. All right, cut. Good work. That's some heavy acting. I'm sorry. We called for ambulances. But they come from far away and take time. So Mr. Yamamoto volunteered to take the critical ones to the hospital. I can't take them all, so I'll call my wife. Please! Mr. Yamamoto's wife and Eri were at home. Because Eri was still young. Will you watch her for me? Mommy, Daddy, bye. Take care of her for us. The two cars left. - I see. - Satisfied? Now leave this village! You too, Mamoru. Forget about the incident. Okay. Can I ask one last thing? Who found the bottle of the chemical used in the poisoning? Yamada? Nice answer. Thank you. You used all this money? What the heck did you do? A thorough investigation. What's this theatrical company fee? 150,000 yen? Six actors, transportation included. That's not what I'm asking. You used all this money to make it clear that only Mr. Yamamoto could have done it? Yeah. Come on. - But something's strange. - What? Mr. Yamamoto. He was frying the chicken so that he'd be done by 1 PM. But the chief just happened to arrive early, causing the festivities to start early. So what? From the situation, Mr. Yamamoto hadn't planned on staying behind. Bam! Shut up. Sorry. - One more thing. - What? The empty bottle of the chemical. It was found in the vineyard. Over here. Right here. So what? I realized as I actually double-fried the chicken. I didn't have any time to step away from the fryer. What are you eating? Is that the chicken? If you have time to eat... I remember now. You closed the laptop on me. And you were eating something. What I'm trying to say is, it was hard enough to just step over to the computer. There was no time to throw the bottle away. What else? For now... Bam! That's all! You're in it too now? So you don't have anything! Bam! How are you going to prove Mr. Yamamoto's innocence? Says the man who didn't even come. Because you left me behind. Well, excuse me. What's with everyone? Sir, you have a visitor. Thank you for waiting. Please... save Eri. Mr. Yamamoto called me right after the incident. I decided to represent him. I knew him well. So I believed in his innocence and fought it up to the Supreme Court. But I was not good enough. He entrusted Eri to me after the ruling of the first trial. Nagumo. Take care of Eri for me. I don't want her to live as the child of a death row convict. At first, I took her in because I felt obligated toward the Yamamotos. But as I watched her grow... Daddy! Here. "Thank you, Daddy" I began to care for her as my very own daughter. But I couldn't prove Mr. Yamamoto's innocence. And couldn't protect Eri. Your regret of not being able to save a man you believed innocent. I understand how you must feel. But then why did you stray from the path of a righteous lawyer? Mr. Yamamoto didn't just die... I killed him. What do you mean? I had the chance to make Mr. Yamamoto an innocent man. A while after the trial started, Ayumu Saraie, a wine wholesaler, came to me. He said he happened to stop nearby the day of the incident and took a sip of the wine after Mr. Yamamoto joined the others. But he was fine. I was scared of being arrested for drinking and driving. But I heard from his wife that he was being accused for what he didn't do. I couldn't let that happen. Thanks for the tea. But something felt off. Because he came to me after the prosecutors claimed that Mr. Yamamoto acted in the seven-minute time frame. So I questioned him further. And then... I'm sorry. Mr. Yamamoto had saved him when he was once in trouble. He wanted to repay Mr. Yamamoto. Repay him? The day of the incident, he was nowhere near the village. I knew that. But out of wanting to save Mr. Yamamoto... I summoned Mr. Saraie. Your Honor. I have no questions. That is all. I'd let my only chance to save him slip through my fingers. You can't allow a person to give a false testimony in court. You only did what was right as a lawyer. And Mr. Yamamoto died. Miyama. Hey, Miyama! Master... I'm so glad to be of use to you, Honoka. I'm a certified Grade A calculating technician. - Here you go. - Thanks. This was your idea, help out. Huh? - Help out. - Huh? You heard me. I'm done with 2006. How about you, Mr. Akashi? I lost my spot again. - Useless. - I heard that. Just as you guessed, we're missing a bottle. Done? Okay, fill me in. [t makes no sense whatsoever. Robot Detective Kane. The logic. Bam! [t makes no sense! - That's Robot Detective B. - Is that manga any good? Not really. Can we start? Right. Everyone shut up. Enough of that nonsense. Mr. Yamamoto took notes on how much of the chemical he used. He used the chemical for five years. In total, he used 178 liters. Each bottle is two liters, so that's 89 bottles. Besides these 89 bottles, five bottles were found in the garage and one at the site. That means, Mr. Yamamoto bought 95 bottles over those five years. But according to the chemical company's logs, Mr. Yamamoto had bought 96 bottles. One bottle too many. So where did that bottle go? The man who first noticed the discrepancy was me, Honoka! Shut up. I did the calculation too. In other words, there's a possibility that somebody bought the chemical under his name. - Also, Mr. Fujino. - Got it. Take a look at this. After Mr. Yamamoto finished frying and joined everyone. Right here. 64 seconds from here. The camera had been set down. Somebody had put the camera down. Mr. Yamamoto is over here, so nobody else is out front. So during those 64 seconds, the man with the camera was free. He could've poisoned the wine during that time. The man filming this video was... Mr. Ota. That was 15 whole years ago. The man in charge of Mr. Yamamoto's sales has already retired. May we have that person's number? He was quite old and passed away last year. I see. Here, Yamada. Here you are. Mamoru, let's take a break. Let me finish this bit first. It can wait. Take a break. We need to talk. I got the size of the car of Sakiko, the wife of Mr. Yamamoto. I made this model of the garage of Mr. Yamamoto. You said of a lot. You lost me there. The car was this big. That means these boxes were moved after she left. The boxes couldn't be moved with the car, and the chemicals couldn't be reached with the boxes. I know, that means it was stolen after she drove away. That way, nobody would hear the garage opening. No, she drove away after the incident happened. Why steal the poison after the poisoning? - Huh? - Then who did it and what for? That's what we need to find out. Hi Mamoru. Dad, they're here. - Hello You came too? It's been a while. What did you want to talk about? Dad wasn't sure about this, but I thought you should know. Don't tell anybody that you heard this from me. Of course not. 15 years ago. Mr. Ota had secretly acquired the chemical Mr. Yamamoto was using. Mr. Ota was jealous of Mr. Yamamoto's wine. And tried to steal the secret. To do so, he needed the same chemical. He told me that he used Mr. Yamamoto's name to buy it. Why didn't you tell me! Cool down, Mr. Nagumo. Why didn't you tell anyone? Mr. Ota is in charge of the village's wine and farming. You have to stay on good terms with him. But I couldn't keep it a secret anymore. We're filing an appeal for a retrial! But we don't know that Mr. Ota did it yet. It doesn't matter who actually did it. The prosecution's conclusion that Mr. Yamamoto was guilty was based on two facts. That only Mr. Yamamoto could have put the chemical in the barrel. And that only Mr. Yamamoto could have bought that chemical. Both are moot now. But something feels off about what Mr. Shigemori said. What? The timing is too good. We don't have time for that. Eri is suffering as we speak from heartless slander. We need to clear her father's name ASAP. Nakatsuka, we're writing up an appeal for a retrial. We hear you're appealing for a retrial. Yes, we are. We've concluded that someone other than Mr. Yamamoto could've done it. And so we filed an appeal. Does that mean somebody else did it? Do you know who it was? Yes, I have a good idea who it was. Tell us more! Welcome. - Here you are. - Thank you. Thanks. Noodles, fried tofu, egg, seaweed, tempura, meat, rice cake. 700 yen. - Can I use Yoshitatsu Points? - Just cash. Hey Ozaki. Mr. Kawakami. One second please. What can I use the points on? It's illusional currency for your dreams. Got any change? Nah, keep the change. Thank you. ...someone other than former death row convict Yamamoto could have poisoned the wine. Could the ruling be overturned? "Was it another villager?" "The real culprit!” "Ota did it" Hashtag Ota did it. It says he's going to hold a press conference at 10 AM. - Mr. Ota is? - It's almost 10 AM! - What? - They're saying Mr. Ota did it. But I never said his name anywhere. Turn on the TV. He's holding a press conference. ...the trial under appeal. What will be revealed today? It's about to start. Some are saying Mr. Ota is the killer. - "Shuichi Otomo, Lawyer” - But that is not true. He is now a victim of slander. As Madarame Law Office says, Mr. Ota did steal Mr. Yamamoto's secret ingredient. By using Mr. Yamamoto's name, he bought the chemical in secret. Mr. Ota would like to apologize concerning that point. I'm very sorry for what I did. But Mr. Ota never used that chemical. Can you prove that? Of course. Here is the chemical Mr. Ota obtained. The seal has never even been broken. What? Isn't that the former chief public prosecutor? Mr. Otomo? You just now noticed? Who's that? He handled Miyama's dad's case. Do you mean you can prove that the chemical is from 15 years ago? - Of course. - Why didn't you tell anyone? I couldn't keep it a secret anymore. Here's the lot number. This will tell you exactly when it's from. The incident happened before Mr. Ota even opened this. And he kept it unopened just in case he was ever accused. Madarame Law Office accused me of being the killer. Madarame Law Office is saying they will clear Mr. Yamamoto's name. But what right do they have after what they've done now? Mr. Miyama, phone call. I'm on my way. Master? Why is Mr. Otomo in on this? He quit being a prosecutor long ago. Maybe he's behind all this. To get back at Mr. Miyama? No, I doubt that. Mr. Sada just jumped the gun. I'm sure Mr. Otomo is just working on this case as a lawyer. But something else is bothering me. What is it? This might've all been a setup. A setup? The villagers knew we were suspecting Mr. Ota, and they used it against us. It was indeed true that Mr. Ota had obtained the chemical 15 years ago. But that was also solid proof that Mr. Ota didn't do it. So they used that to throw us under the bus? The villagers? But why? I'm going out. Clients are calling wanting to terminate their contract with us. Mr. Sada! Mr. Wakatsuki. What's the meaning of that press conference? I see I was wrong in entrusting Honoka to you. I... Our company, Yoshitsune Automobiles... will be reconsidering our contract with you. You and I are over! Over. No, Mr. Wakatsuki... Mr. Wakatsuki, we're still friends, right? You and I are over! But you promised to go to the World Expo with me... What a strange place to meet. No one comes to a courtroom when there isn't a trial. It's been a while. So? How may I help you? Have you ever thought about how a judge feels up here? No. When we sentence a man to death. We'll never forget the look on the man's face. We don't sentence them to death out of hatred. If we hated them... we wouldn't be able to judge fairly. The feelings of the bereaved, justice in society... We bear it all on our shoulders. Do you really think... a single man can carry all that weight? What? That's kind of presumptuous, don't you think? I heard you're looking into an old case. You can dig into the past all you want. But know how many people you're hurting with it. It's true that we made a mistake. But we haven't arrived at the truth yet. May I go now? You never change, huh? - You're home. - Hi. I'm home. Your office said I'd find you here. Have a seat. I'll make you some plain and good tea. No thanks. Mr. Miyama. I'm sorry for everything. Mr. Ota was innocent. The villagers set us up, and we have nothing to work with. I wanted to do what I could for Eri. But once again, I could do nothing. Everything we've done was a waste. I don't think it was a waste. What? We found out some new things. Mr. Ota couldn't have put the chemical in the wine. And the villagers... why did they set us up? I won't stop until I find the truth. Are you done talking? You're the owner? When did you come in? Before you, actually. I dropped some CDs, and you came in as I was picking them up. I thought you were Kanako, so I hid. Kanako's the girl who made the CDs. She'd make me buy the lot if she knew I dropped them. Then you and Hiroto started having a serious conversation. And I had to stay hidden. I'm Hiroto's cousin, Bando. - Mr. Miyama's Cousin? - Don't scare me. I'm leaving. Oh, um, since I heard what I just heard. Hiroto's dad... He was framed for murder too. He died in prison. He died while appealing to a higher court. So the appeal was withdrawn, and the first ruling was dismissed. That means he can't file an appeal. That's right. He couldn't. Those days were really tough on Hiroto. Mr. Miyama knew he couldn't save his father through the law. And he still became a lawyer? That's why he's so obstinate about finding the truth. And he proved his father's innocence. I don't know much about the law. But you can still save your daughter through the law, right? Huh? Mr. Kokeshi? You're home, Bando. You came all this way? A brand new one. It's huge. Thanks to you, we were able to prevent another false charge. Thanks. That's not why I agreed to do it. Thanks to that press conference, Mr. Miyama has been set on the right path. I don't know if that's a good thing, though. But still... Mr. Miyama will pursue the truth as he always does. That's just like him. Now that Grandfather has cut ties with Mr. Sada, I must leave. Which means I must quit my apprenticeship under Master Miyama. Even if my batteries die, I must find the proof! What's with the long sad monologue? Nothing. You should rest a bit. Master Miyama hasn't given up. Neither shall B. I must not give up! But there's nothing we can do. This firm is going down and so are we! Hello. The hero always arrives late. Ms. Tachibana! A ya no! - I missed you so much! - Me too! Here, you can only get this shirt in the US. Wow, thank you! - Here, from New York. - Thank you. This is so cool! They have this in New York? - Yeah. - What are you doing here? Didn't Mr. Miyama tell you? I have another gift for you all. Thank you. Mr. Miyama's girlfriend? You like younger girls? I'm the new lawyer, Honoka Kono. - I knew it. - Liar. You had no idea. You didn't? What's that? Remember that sample you guys borrowed from the lab? We sent it to the US. I utilized my network of lawyers in the US to use the latest machine. I had the Super Sei yan Ill analyze the sample. So if the poison in the vomit and that in the barrels don't match, that means the people who died didn't die by Mr. Yamamoto's chemical. So... Morning. Morning. Listen up. Our firm is in a tight spot because of this Tenkamura wine poisoning. But we must not... - Why...? - How've you been? Ms. Tachibana analyzed the poison with the Super Soya... The poison was analyzed? You brought the results? All this way? You're amazing! And the results? The results? - Tranquilo. - I'm sorry. Right. Calm down everyone. Listen well. According to the analysis by the US's Super Sei yan Ill... -Yes... - The two chemicals... We don't want it to be the same, right? ...were the same! Weren't the same! One or the other... We don't know! The probability that the chemicals were the same was 49.99 percent. Darn that number! What did you come here for? I will not give up! 49.997 They said the sample was too old. - You hear that? - Yeah, it's 15 years old. Here. - Analysis costs and... - Costs? Plane fare and... - What did you say? - Gifts. - Gifts? - Here's the bill. Congratulations on becoming manager. This is absurd! Did it rain too much money? Why did you have to fly over? You could've just called. - Look at this bill. - Today's a special day. IWGP, World Heavyweight Championships! Yeah! Did you hear yesterday's radio show? You heard it in the US? Yeah, nowadays you can... Master. Master! Look at the amount of wine. It's different. You're all out of breath. Hey, shut up. Panting, panting, underwear! Cheers. Darn it. The prosecution's proof that Mr. Yamamoto did it was groundless. So why did he go and cut ties with me? You're making no sense. Shall I sing for you? Wine Red Minced Meat. - Darn it. - Excuse me! Check please. Can I have an autograph? Why not, huh? The chemical was kept in a locker in Mr. Yamamoto's garage. The loud shutters would've prevented anybody from stealing it beforehand. But somebody moved the boxes after Sakiko drove away. 3,680 yen. Here you go. The Rainmaker and the Fierce Warrior! Hello! Hi. Hello there. What will you have? Protein. Those who drank the wine before the festival were safe. But by the time the festival started, it was poisoned. Those who drank it were taken to the hospital. Newbie! Can you take our picture? Please! - Like this? - Can we? Ready? Okay. - Can you take more? - More? How about like this? - All right. - Yeah. And why, after the police started investigating, was there more wine in the glass? Thanks, newbie! Thank you. Bam! You're kidding, Mr. Inaki's autograph? The author of Robot Lawyer B? He comes often. I'll introduce you to him. My electronic brain is about to short. We don't know for sure if the poison in the vomit and barrel match. The probability was 49.99 percent. So if they weren't the same... Can we order some food? Sure. - Let's drink first. - Sure. Mr. Goto? You want to change, don't you? Cheers! It's the toast of CHAOS! When was the chemical put in the barrel? It could only have happened in the seven minutes after the chief arrived. Who could've done it? And how? Special spicy biryani and mild herbal raita sauce. Why did he cut ties with me? At home, at the office. Even here. Nobody wants to be with me. Nobody's my friend. I knew it. I'm not cut out to be a leader. Maybe I'll become a prosecutor. A prosecutor! Darn it. No, you pour that afterwards to change the taste. The food Hiroto made for me has been wasted! Give me yours. I wanted to change the taste too. I'll introduce Mr. Inaki to you. I'm the one introducing him. You'll still be my friend, won't you? You're a great guy. Shut up. I'll let you on my cruiser three times! The ocean is great. Makes you feel like a leader. That's the poisoned wine barrel. You hear me? Shut up! I said, shut up! Master Miyama? Command silence! Be quiet. I couldn't do anything. So if the chemicals don't match... 49.99 percent. ...take the critical ones to the hospital... Mr. Yamamoto was alone from this point on. It's weighing on my mind... A heavy question... to cask. 4 points out of 100. A heavy question to ask. A heavy question to cask! That came out of left field! He's on a roll now! Mr. Sada. Congratulations on becoming manager of the firm. Really, thanks. Let's make merry with some sherry. 3 points out of 100. Merry with some sherry! I'm feeling better now. You're the best. Wine don't you tell me about it? Wine don't you tell me about it? It just keeps coming. I'm not wine- ing. Four in a row! That's a first! I can't believe it, four in a row. I'm going to eat this now. Yummy! Yummy rum-rummy! See, it rhymes! Yummy and rummy. Like the drink. Get it? Don't give me that look. You're looking a bit pale ale. See? That works too. Give it up. - It rhymes too! - I'm leaving. Come on! I brought the picture. What's this going to prove? Everything. Miyama! The truck is here. Do you have everything ready? Can you trust your prosecution friend? - Who knows? - Come on. Thank you for coming. I'm Sada, manager of Madarame Law Office. I'm truly sorry for the trouble I've caused everyone. Especially Mr. Ota, I'm very sorry for what I did. I apologize from the bottom of my heart. We will do all we can... Hey. The last re-enactment was done with simple props. So it wasn't perfect. You mean, you want us to do it again? Yes. We checked the footage and prepared something more real. We'll use them to do a perfect re-enactment. This Miyama here is really picky about the weirdest things. He's always causing me trouble. You see that? But once we do a perfect re-enactment, nobody would doubt you anymore. A bit about me. Akashi. I've kept this word dear to my heart as a lawyer. Sincerity. It's upside down. Sincerity. From the bottom of my heart. So won't you give us one last chance? Please! I beg you. Come on, guys. We have nothing to hide, so let's do that perfect re-enactment. - Mamoru. - Do it for my sake, too. Please. This is the last time. Driver. Let's do this! Wine, two. Wine, two. Look here. Enough of that. Get moving. Oh, yes. Please. Please start! For the last time. Take your positions. Let's do this. Yeah! Ready? Wine, two. Wine, two. Wine, two. Wine, two. This way. Over here. All right! Do we really need to do this? This re-enactment? Is everyone ready? Here's to wine! Here's to wine! What's wrong? Somebody call an ambulance! That's enough. That's it. Now, keep your promise and leave. No, please continue. Continue? Carry out those who've fallen sick. Let's go back to being poisoned. But easy now. - Begin. - Do we have to do that? And, there. Are you okay? What's wrong? Hmm? What's wrong, everybody? To be honest... We were in a panic and don't remember well. No, no. You remembered so clearly what happened until they collapsed. But you suddenly forget the rest? It was 15 years ago. Then let me ask you some questions. Hurry, OI' Akashi. Who added the wine to this poisoned glass? Why would anybody do that? That's strange. Take a look at this picture. This is from the footage Mr. Ota took as the events unfolded. And this is what the police took. Compare the two, and you see that there's more wine afterwards. You're right. This means that as sick people were getting carried away, someone poured wine that could've been poisoned. I did it. But for what reason? I saw the victims as they collapsed. I washed the glasses so nobody would drink the wine. But I realized the police would get angry for tampering with evidence. So I poured some wine from that barrel. I see. So that's what happened. Thank you. Are you satisfied? Yes. Because I now know who did it. Mr. Yamamoto didn't put the chemical into the barrel. Nonsense. Only he and I had access to that chemical. Which is why after the incident, somebody went to his home to steal some. On what basis are you saying that? This is the picture the police took after the incident. Sakiko, Mr. Yamamoto's wife... She always parked next to this locker with the chemicals. Like so. So what? Look closely. In the picture the police took, the boxes are placed like so. Ms. Sakiko was called as soon as the incident took place. How did she drive off with the boxes in the way? - Well... - I know. She moved the boxes after getting the car out. She was in a hurry to take people to the hospital. Why would she need to do such a thing? There's only one answer. Somebody went to their garage after the incident. To obtain the chemical. And after the incident... somebody switched the wine barrels. Please. Thank you. Mr. Fujino. Please. This is the actual barrel with the poisoned wine that the police took. Look here. See that dent? [t was made when the chief hit the side with the wooden hammer. Maybe it was dented afterwards. - I think so too. - No. Mr. Fujino. We can see from the footage the dent that was made then. Observe. It's exactly the same. The police took the barrel that was placed outside. But that was the barrel that was supposed to be inside. So why was it out here? Because somebody switched it after the incident. Am I wrong? Why don't you say anything? What you all did... You had to change the chemical in the wine to the one Mr. Yamamoto used in order to frame him. You did so to protect something. And that will solve all the questions. During the opening of the wine barrel, there were others in this village who weren't in the footage. Here they are. The ones who poisoned the wine 15 years ago... were these children, weren't they? Stop. One of them was Keita, who left the village two years ago. And the other is... Mamoru. I... poisoned the wine? Stop your rubbish! Mr. Ota, that's enough. I'm sorry. You're right. The ones who poisoned the wine were my son Mamoru and his friend Keita. This makes the wine yummy. The chemical that was put in wasn't Mr. Yamamoto's. It was a chemical that was left in the storage room here. Some adults saw the kids going into the storage room. When we checked later, the chemical in the storage room... Somebody...! We found the empty bottle. It was all my fault. I told you that the chemicals were special medicines to make good wine. Because of that... I kept it secret for you. Dad... Enough. It was all my idea. I framed Yamamoto for the future of the children. While Yamamoto and his wife were at the hospital, we switched the barrels. We stole the chemical from his garage and poured it in the barrel. We refilled the glasses with the newly poisoned wine. And threw the old barrel away in the woods. We adults are all to blame. But... considering Mamoru and Keita's futures... Can't you keep this a secret? How dare you! Mr. Nagumo, you don't want to do that! It's not just the victims! An innocent man was sentenced to death. Mr. Yamamoto and his wife... They left their beloved daughter behind and died! Their pain... Their daughter's pain... What do you know of it! That girl... She should've still been living with her real parents. You took her happiness away. All of you did! That girl's... I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Once we file an appeal for a retrial, all of this will become public. What you did to innocent people. The pain you caused them. That fact cannot be changed. The sky is crying. Your grandson has grown so much. This omelet is good. Your food makes people happy. Is that really so? The retrial passed, but the statute of limitations for hiding a criminal had run out. None of the villagers were charged. And Mamoru had it hard, too. It was a tough thing for him to find out. It's hard to say if it was the right thing to do to pursue the truth. We don't know if the truth can make people happy. But... one thing's for sure. Lies can't save people. "Eri Nagumo Concert" Kono, you came? Mr. Sada. My wife and daughter. I'm Honoka Kono, a lawyer at Mr. Sada's firm. Hello, I'm his wife, Yukiko. Hello, I'm his daughter, Kasumi. What a nice daughter. Mr. Nagumo. Mr. Nagumo! Not going in? What you've done in the dark all this time. You confessed it all to the Bar Association, huh? I didn't want to face the reality that I couldn't save Mr. Yamamoto. I lied that I was doing it for Eri. And strayed from the right path. I've no right to see Eri. You're running away? Did you talk to Eri and ask her how she was feeling? It's useless to talk about... Cool down, Mr. Nagumo. You won't know until... Bam! You actually ask her! Stop it. You were saying good stuff. Don't ruin it like that. Mr. Nagumo, if you did something wrong, then just start over again. It's time. Let's go. My master's Rule Number 8. If you give up, you'll never find the truth. Good day. That wasn't so shabby, Dad. You heard? No dad loves her daughter as much as I do. You'll buy me anything for my next birthday? Sure, anything. Daddy! Here. Eat your carrots, too. But... I made it for you. Yeah, it's good. Happy birthday. Thanks. "Happy birthday, Dad. You're the nicest, I love you. Eri" I'll go cut the cake. Bravo! Bravo. Thank you for coming with me. "Yamamoto Family" It took 15 years. But we reached the truth. "Courthouse” Mr. Miyama? Long time no see. Did you hear about Mr. Kawakami? No. He... He resigned. Mr. Kawakami! I don't know how he was feeling as he left the courthouse. But I realized after spending some time as a lawyer. How the prosecution can gather evidence easier. And how the lawyers are at a disadvantage. We judges must understand that and try to see the truth. You really look down on me. Of course not, Your Honor. Forget it! Give everyone my regards. Wait, wait for me! I'm here! Let's go. Yeah, let's go. Your new puppet? I bought the magazine, look. He's on the cover. The Criminal Case Team is criminally talented. LOL! He was going to shut it down, too. I'll show him. - We're back. - Hi. Oh, nice. Then what? - Then? - That's new. Look, Mr. Loser Sada. You did it, guys. Great work the other day. Things are going so well now. You just made it harder for us. Come on, lay off it. You're always... Cool down! - Mr. Sada. - He's always messing with my logo. Let's do the usual. But that's... Fine. Just this once, okay? Thank you. Please. - Sorry. - Oh, come on. Just shake her hand, come on. Thank you. Enough of that. Come on. Hurry it up. Mr. Wakatsuki is here to see you. Why does he always come unannounced? Oh no! Wait! Super Civil Lawyer? I'm not writing that again. Kono, get those papers about the corporate merger! Show Mr. Wakatsuki to the meeting room. - Let's go! - Ready! Come on!
