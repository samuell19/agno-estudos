Despicable! There's no denying it. I do not like this at all. I'm a private eye, not a superintendent. I have no right to… -That's my niece, Nicole. -Sorry, dear madam. Their wedding is tomorrow. Is that so? They don't need me for that. Doesn't the attitude of my future nephew seem odd to you? -Odd? -Let's be honest, it's abnormal. -Abnormal? -Yes. I did not notice. Let me see? I don't think so. On the contrary, it seems quite normal. It appears that way. Appearances play in his favor. -He's up to no good. -Indeed, madam. Indeed. I know men. I'm sure. I'm telling you that Michel is hiding something from us. -What is it? -You're the detective. You don't want my niece to go through what happened on September 22nd? -What happened on September 22nd? -That's for me to know. Her happiness is in your hands. -Yes, but… -I want to know the truth. And to find out the secret that visibly torments my future nephew. Yes, of course. "Visibly." Be good, my darling. I can't take it any more. This isn't the life for a red-blooded male in love. -And a faithful one at that, of course. -Faithful? Well done, you. Not even married yet and he's in awe of his faithfulness. -Very promising… -My love, don't be silly. I know that as of tomorrow, my credit is gone. Oh dear, I'm gonna be late for my meeting. -A meeting today? -Yes. -With who? -With the minister. The first after 15 years of good and loyal service. -What does he want with you? -Only good things, I imagine. -You're hiding something from me. -Yes, my darling. I'm trying to hide from you that my career is floundering. A meeting with the minister? Noted. From now on, madam, wherever your nephew goes, and whatever he does, he will have but one shadow, mine. Oh, by the way! -Which minister is it? -The minister of agriculture. French agriculture is proud of you, my dear Bouchard. You have done much good. That's right. And your discovery, 20 years from now, will undoubtedly help bring a great deal of good to the world. And why not right away? They are all the same! They invent, they invent, without worrying about the consequences. Such children. Come on, my dear Bouchard, think about it a little. Your remarkable work on over-activated hormones made it possible to put into circulation the prototype of the Dorothy dairy cow, which performed exceptionally. You promised us 200 liters of milk per day. And we hit that target Tuesday. I think you must be satisfied. Truth be told, we are quite over-loaded. We are proud. We are very proud. But we have a surplus. The time for fat cows has not yet arrived. We already have too much of everything. Too much wheat, too much sugar, too much milk. -What do we do with the surplus? -My colleague from the interior is right. If the result of your research were ever to become known, the agricultural market would collapse. It'd be irreversible. The Head of State told me yesterday. Did the Head of State tell you that? I'm going to be in trouble. Of course not, don't worry. The government has ensured that our secret does not get leaked. But from now on, you no longer belong to yourself. -You belong to the nation. -But I get married tomorrow. We know. And we approve. Everything is set for your honeymoon. We'll take care of everything. -We are going to Venice tomorrow. -No. "No"? My wife is very fond of Italy. You wouldn't be safe there. We have a duty to keep you on national soil. To better protect you and Dorothy. We need to have you on hand at all times. We found you something very comfortable near Paris. Am I supposed to spend my honeymoon in the suburbs? The Île-de-France, Mr. Bouchard, is great fun in the fall. And so much less conventional than Venice. What if I refuse? Two gendarmes will take you there. -What am I going to tell my wife? -Nothing. -"Nothing"? -Put differently, you will tell her what we tell you to tell her. From this moment on, all your words, all your movements, all your actions, every one of them, are a State secret. All my movements? My poor wife… Not a word, even to her. Top secret. Top secret? The Betterave is not the Mirage IV. It is even more serious for now. -If I had known-- -Too late for that. The importance of your research is such that a leak would be catastrophic. You bust your balls, drive yourself into the ground, lose sleep, lose your youth for the love of humanity and then you are placed under arrest. No, young man, under police protection. This is happening everywhere. Even in America. I'm an agricultural engineer, not James Bond. All the more reason for these precautions. The future of French agriculture is at stake and this future involves absolute secrecy… This is the voice of our minister. The cows! Are they listening to us too? You're not allowed to die. Here are the measures we've taken for your safety. For your wedding, nothing has changed. Go take this to the boss. Have you changed your mind? Here is your mission order. We have selected a room with a bathroom for you. For two people, rest assured. At the hotel. I asked not to be disturbed! What do you mean, "shush"? Explain. CAREFUL THE LINE IS BUGGED You damn piece of crap! You total hunk of junk! Talk or I'll smack you! And you, you piece of crap, why did you screw up this little mechanical wonder? Siberia! FOR YOUR PROTECTION WE HAVE ASSIGNED YOU A BODYGUARD What? But I don't want… Your bodyguard, Mr. Bouchard. Michel Bouchard, Valerie Leblanc. Nice to meet you, sir. My bodyguard? Are you kidding? My fiancee is a jealous panther. Valerie is not a woman, she is a contract worker. Nicole will never believe this. I don't like contract workers. -Thank you. -Excuse me, miss. I have nothing against you. In fact, I find you lovely. But we're taking the joke too far. I await your instructions. I understand. I understand perfectly. All in all, given my situation, I would have preferred a gorilla man. A gorilla man? Impossible. They're all already taken. On a tour of the southwest. Obvious. Quite obvious. Your future nephew's secret is a woman. A woman! The events of September 22nd were very damaging. We are cursed in this family. A woman! -I saw them leave the ministry. -A girl from the ministry? My Lord! A secretary, of course. She looked better than a secretary. A very beautiful girl. Did you like her? Of course you did. You men are all the same, disgusting. A pair of stilettos and off you go! -I didn't see her shoes. -This is not the end of it. -Where are you going? -To tell my niece. -Hang on! -Back on your towel. -Calm down. There's no proof. -You saw them, didn't you? I saw them come out of the ministry. But that isn't enough. You need proof. I am ready to bring it to you subject to a revision of our conditions. I have already given you 50,000 francs. That, madam, is the rate without proof. A free denouncement, a denouncement subject to verification. -With proof, it'll cost more. -That's good enough for me. My niece won't suffer as she did on September 22nd. Take care, madam! It is undoubtedly more serious. This woman who's come to flirt with your future nephew the day before his wedding, wants to blackmail him, it's an old trick. Come on! Blackmail? I don't know. Threatening him to come and cause a scandal. Tomorrow, expect vitriol at church. Gunshots at the reception. Bang! Nicole? Vitriol? Madam! It's just a guess! A mere hypothesis. A detective has to consider these things or we'd all be unemployed. Bye. Auntie! What happened? We were talking and all of a sudden… Auntie! It's me, Nicole. Just a little light-headedness. The heat, the flowers. -And who are you? -I'm just passing by. You wouldn't know my name, it's François. -François? -François. -Uncle Jean's son? -Jean? -From Sables d'Olonne? -Yes, that's it. He told you to come? -It's not that far. -It's all the emotion. -They're very angry. -This is so stupid. Auntie! -You were told? -Yes. It is Uncle Jean's son, he's here for my wedding. But of course, Uncle Jean's son. Uncle Jean's son? Here, Comrade Ambassador. Begging your pardon, your excellency. Horrible imperialist car, a petrol guzzler that's impossible to park, giant piece of crap, but indispensable for towing caravans out of the capitalist mainstream. Caravans. Little bourgeois caravans. Stupid and backward looking. In actual fact, a masterpiece of the people's popular factories from our people lead by popular leadership. Double invisible bottom on swiveling and oiled partition for little Dorothy's hiding place. Crack! Back she comes. Mission accomplished. Now, your excellency, having covered resources, let's check human resources. Before your staff comes in, I want to tell you, Ivanov, do not mess this up. This idea is yours alone. If it doesn't work, this is on you. Excellency, I will succeed. Comrade Olga, precious and devoted employee. Intelligence, zero. Physical appearance, less than zero. Sex appeal, double zero. Health, 20 out of 20! And… she can't read! As she cannot write either, no chance of her copying or sending information. Absolute secrecy. -I'm going first! No! -No, me! Yes! Siberia! Which of you two is stronger? -I am! -I am! The most intelligent? -I am! -I am! The dumbest? -I am! -I am! Your Excellency, you can see for yourself and I ask you to inform the comrades of the Presidium, that in my service, the personality cult has been entirely eradicated. Your Excellency, we are ready. We will never be ready. -And who's next? -OSS 117. On a mission, colonel. -And the 118? -As well, colonel. And 119? 120, 121, and 122? All on missions, colonel. Ah, 123 maybe? Died in action, colonel. Keep your books up to date. In such cases, add a cross. Yes, colonel. And among our allies, no one? No one, colonel. James Bond? -Not free until 72. -I thought so. Nothing then. -There is… -Who? -No, impossible. -Go on. Judge for yourself, Colonel. Excuse me, colonel. Who is it? Cassius Miller, aka 001. -An independent agent. -Obviously. Has he worked for us before? Oh no, never. Thankfully. We have no choice. God save America. I have two large eggs In my little frying pan Two large red eggs stained with white Yes! Hello, gents. A little out of breath? The sixth floor with no elevator is hard. If you're after a donation, I don't have any money. For the rest, television, insurance, I have everything I need. Sorry, my apologies. Captain Tuxon, Colonel Tumbled, special services. Special services? Apologies, do come in. Sit down, take a seat. I apologize for the mess, you must be used to it. It's a bit like the FBI. Wait, if you'll allow me to… If you would like to sit down. I don't have a maid. You know how difficult it is to find a good housekeeper these days. Soon we'll be cleaning Spanish houses. -Miller! -Yes? -What are you doing at the moment? -Cooking eggs. I was about to taste them but it doesn't matter, I hate eggs. But aside from that? I tinker, here and there, chugging along, I come, I go, I observe, I listen, I make inquiries. Miller, I told Colonel Tumbled about you. Oh, how lovely. Don't you worry, I'll be sure to tell him about you. -Miller! -My pleasure. Sorry. This is a very important mission. My specialty! The Russian agents are already there. Oh, well done. I don't know them, they don't know me. We will go unnoticed. Yes, but the French service is on guard. Are we taking something from the French? -Their Pierrelatte thing, I imagine? -No! We already have that. And it is not important. Ah, good? So what is this all about? About a cow. A cow? That changes everything. Oh dear! A cow! That causes problems, a cow, eh? We will pay handsomely. I should think so, it might be expensive. I'll need a suit. I can't represent the country dressed like this. -You will have it. -May I? Three buttons, the Italian kind. I like those a lot because they're fitted. Who cares! A suit without shoes is like a bird without wings. -You will have the shoes too. -Excellent. So is it a yes or a no? You don't have a prepared plan, by any chance? No. None. Too bad, that would save time. We'll make do with what he have. We have almost no limits! Take my seat, Comrade Ivanov. -No, mine. -No, mine. Mine! Enough! I will stay standing. Sit! Open your ears, comrades. Here is my plan. Smirnoff and Petrossian, you'll kidnap Dorothy. Comrade Olga and I will watch the sentimental, reactionary little expert to find out where he spends his pornographic, bourgeois honeymoon. All that crap disgusts me! End of the first half. Second half. Kidnapping Dorothy successfully. So, Smirnoff, Petrossian… Draft, window. -All clear? -Da! -Perfect! -And comrade look-alike? Oh, comrade look-alike! I forgot all about comrade look-alike. Thank you, Comrade Smirnoff, for reminding me about comrade look-alike. After all, it is the most ingenious trick in our whole plan. You haven't forgotten the scar? Niet, Comrade Ivanov. Did you follow instructions? Da, Comrade Ivanov. Nobody saw him? -Nobody. -He hasn't moved from here. Oh, very similar. Perfect scar. A masterpiece of popular and democratic aesthetic surgery. What are you reading, comrade look-alike? Notepad, François Mauriac. Continue, excellent piece of work. Come closer. Until Dorothy is kidnapped, increase surveillance of the French expert. I'm fed up with this, you're watching me all the time. Me? But not at all! Aunt Berthe said, "Go see if Michel needs you." Ah, my button! Again? That's twice, now. I didn't ask you to come, but as you're here do something. -Who is it now? -I am going to see. Look no further, I think I've found it. Ah, well done! Well, go open it! -Bouchard? -Yes, that's right. -It's you? -No, he's busy. Who is it? The postman. The postman? Hello. A package for you. What is it? Looks like a gift. From the Ministry of Agriculture. A pearl! -Administration work pays off, eh? -It depends on the ministry. At the PTT, they are rather tightfisted. Get a transfer! Tip him. -Oh, yes. -A tip? I'll keep the change then, shall I? Very pretty. Don't touch it, you're so clumsy. Again? Be nice, go open it. Sure. -Who is that? -Floréal. For Mr. Bouchard. Is he there? Michel, it's a shipment of flowers! Who sent me this? It's the comrade… It says on a small card. "Congratulations to the farming comrade." -They did it right, at least. -I'm tired! -Help him take this to the kitchen. -Okay. It's very… bulky. Come over here. To the right. Push. There. -You, here? On my wedding day? -Those are the orders. And the cousin who is in the kitchen! Come in. -I thought I heard ringing. -Yes, wrong apartment. Wrong apartment? -There it is! Goodbye, gentlemen. -Goodbye, sir. My collar button. A piece of crap! Okay, we have to look for a new one. I'll look for it on my own, thank you. You may go. We're cousins, so let's keep it informal. Fine, then, get out. I don't need anything else. -Are you sure? -Certain! -What if the doorbell goes? -I'll answer it. As you please. I forgot to turn off the kitchen faucet. -It's not important. -Yes, it is! I don't want you to drown. It's done, I can leave reassured. There will be no drowning in the family. Well, see you soon. -If you don't change your mind. -Very clever! -What are you doing? -Quiet! Will you explain it to me? What is that? The minister's pin! Very pretty, the minister's pin. A miniature microphone. Oh, my! SERVICE ENTRANCE Just as we thought. Foreign agents are on the attack. Now it's serious. I can't leave your side for even one second. Ah, lovely! And how am I going to explain why you're here? I don't know, introduce me as a relative. -A cousin, for example. -Very funny! There will be cousins at the wedding. And if I refuse? You know what happens. You will be locked up for your safety. On my wedding day? I didn't choose the day. It's total blackmail. Me, I won't let go of you. I haven't done anything to you. You're ruining my life. I'll remember, about Dorothy. Dorothy… "Dorothy." A photo. Don't move. Come down, please. No, go back up, please. No, come down, please. Go back up, please. -Come down! -Go back up! I said, "Come down!" I said, "Go back up!" Don't move, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Well, do we shoot our colleagues? Very naughty. Usually, when I aim, I hit. That one popped on its own. If you poured some into the glasses that might be better. -Da! -You're not from around here. -I am, I am… -But from the east then. Northeast. It's funny, I'm sure I've heard your accent somewhere before. That would surprise me, I go out very little. Me, I go out a lot. Maybe, I'm sure I recognize your face. Same here. Maybe we have together worked before. -Yes, I have traveled a lot. -Where to? -All over. -For who? GTC. -The syndicate? -General Transatlantic Company. SPY DIRECTORY Champagne, whiskey, martini? Please, go ahead. Champagne, whiskey, martini? -Champagne. -Martini. -To your happiness. -Thanks. Champagne, whiskey? -This one? -Oh sorry. Very pretty. -He's watching you constantly. -Who is? Don't turn around. François. -The Sables d'Olonne cousin? -Not from Sables or d'Olonne, or a cousin. He's definitely an agent. -Who is? -No idea, but we're taking care of it. -What do I do? -Smile. You know nothing. Tonight, at the hotel, I'll be there. Let me know if something goes wrong. In your room, you can kick the floor. Kick the floor? So as not to be spotted. My room is below yours. -I won't budge. -Charming. -What a great wedding night. -It's just the way it is. Well then? Are we plotting, little cousins? Valerie was just telling me about the pleasures of a honeymoon in Italy. -Do you like Italy? -A great deal. Darling, come join your guests. Excuse me, I'm the groom. -Such a lovely couple. -So lovely. Don't you think… that it's a bit stuffy in here? Yes, this living room is a real sauna. Don't lose sight of her, I'm worried. Do you think she's armed? You can count on me, I won't let her out of my sight. -You've been to Italy? -Yes. I dream of going to Italy. We could go together. You could be my guide. Don't be disappointed, a honeymoon in Italy is old-fashioned. Venice, old-fashioned? Vadim goes all the time. -Everyone's going. -Clearly not. Come on, darling, we're going to a lovely place. -Where is it? -That's a surprise. What are you doing? Your plane takes off in an hour, hurry up. You are right, auntie. It would be a shame to miss it. Come on. HOTEL DE LA DAUBERIE -Hello? -Valerie here. I've arrived. Are you okay? Yes, thanks. Remember, my room is below yours. If there's a problem, let me know. Yes, fine. Who's that? Nobody. A call to say we can go down for dinner. Enjoy your meal. You're not upset about Venice? Not at all, my darling. How can I be when I'm with you? This hotel is lovely. Do you like our room? I'll tell you tomorrow. It's good to finally be alone. Say, how about we go up to our room? Let me finish dinner. Take it easy, Olga. Take it easy. Beware of this imperialist crap. They're hypocritical, devious and corrosive to the popular stomach. Smirnoff and Petrossian should be on their way. Do they have the phone number for this place? Yes. Fine. Very good. H-hour is fast approaching. Excuse me, ma'am. I don't see Miss Leblanc. -She arrived? -Yes, she's in her room. Thank you. -François? -What? Well, what a surprise. -I thought you were in Italy. -We're leaving tomorrow. We had come here for some quiet, and we succeeded. Does the gentleman wish to sit down? The gentlemen may, if he wishes. I wouldn't want to intrude. Please sit down. Will the gentleman be dining? Head cheese, foie gras, cassoulet, navarin, duck with olives… There. Or we have yogurt. The gentleman will dine lightly. Who is this one again? I don't like that ugly face. Looking for someone? No, just glancing to see if there isn't someone here I recognize. -You come here often? -Yes, sometimes… Sorry, I'll be back in two minutes. I beg your pardon, sir. I think someone is asking for me. I forgot to bring a handkerchief! Excuse me, I'm going upstairs to get one. I'll be back. I'll be right back… Looking for something? Yes, I'm looking for the bathroom. Not here. It's the little door over there, across the way. Thank you. It's occupied. It is occupied. I'm waiting. Me, too. Too bad, I will come back. On second thought, me too. -You are right, me too. -No, please. -I'll come back. -I'll give you my place. Hey, the cousin from Sables is gone? He went to get a handkerchief. Easy, Comrade Olga! Beaujolais is not our good wine from the Ukraine. -You took a while for that handkerchief. -Yes. It was at the bottom of my suitcase. How stupid, I always put them there. Is everything okay? -You seem worried. -Yes, I have to be honest. -Please do. -The handkerchief was just an excuse. -I thought as much. -Listen… I'm not alone. The young lady accompanying me is ill. -Nothing serious, I hope? -No, she's resting. You must know her! She was at lunch this afternoon. -Oh, yes? -Her name? Dorothy! -Sorry, I… -You oaf! -Can't you be careful? -It slipped, I'm sorry, I… -Siberia! -I apologize, sincerely. -Don't get in such a state. -I know. It's just my tracheitis. I'm used to it, I have just the thing. Where are my pills? Ah, yes, in my room. -I'll come with you? -No, I'll be right back. I'll go see how Dorothy is doing. -Of course. -Dorothy… You've had enough, Olga! Sir, are you looking for something? -Yes, my room. -Which room? -Five. -It's upstairs. The only one. Thank you so much. Well? A sleepwalker? I was just getting some fresh air and… You took on too much and the weight dragged you down. -Ow, my ankle. -What is it, my bunny? The little bunny fell out of the window. -Out the window? -It's nothing. I'll explain, let's go up to our room. -Where did he come from? -He fell out the window. The window? Calm down, Michel. Olga. There are terrible things going on here that I don't like at all. I'll take a closer look. This guy is definitely from the DST. I think I'll… take him out. Hey! Siberia! Salt mines! Outer Mongolia! Beijing! She doesn't care, this bitch! Mission accomplished, Comrade Ivanov? Rotten regime, drunk agents. Go up to your room and do not move under any circumstances. What did I do to Lenin to get myself in this crap? -Comrade, I'm going… -Yes? No! -Certainly not now. No. -OK, comrade. The main thing is nothing's broken. My poor ducky. What an idea going through the window. -Especially since there's a door. -Ouch! It hurts. All cozy, at that! It's over, move your foot. Perfect. In two days, you'll be good as new. Thanks, François. It's normal, between cousins. On your wedding night, too. What rotten luck. You're feeling okay? Get out. Get out! Don't worry! You have your lives ahead of you. Don't exert yourself. Do you do room service? Of course, on request. Foie gras, Pommard wine. -Thank you, I was just curious. -All right, sir. I'll be right back, honey. Two minutes. It's just you and me, Dorothy! Dorothy? It's a boy, not a girl. Oh, excuse me. I hadn't noticed. I beg your pardon. Yes, it's a cat. Where is he now? Probably in his room. Nicole! Oh, Nicole! What happened to you? My little dove, answer me. Cologne. In the bathroom! Oh, it happened! She got it, that bitch Dorothy. Nicole! She got her, that Dorothy… What is he doing here? My darling? Nicole? What are you, crazy? -I've seen some jealous people but… -It's not me. -Sure, it's your sister. -You are starting to get on my last nerve. Watch your tone, will you? -You and your Dorothy. -What? On your wedding day. Well done indeed. What do you mean? -You know perfectly well. -Not really. Instead of spouting nonsense, help me carry her. Nice wedding night. -You reap what you sow. -Enough. No, not even close. -You don't have an aspirin? -No! Refusing to assist a person in danger? A fine figure of a man. Leave us alone. -You could have hit less hard. -It wasn't me. I know! This isn't over. Two minutes and 20 seconds left before H-hour. This land of enjoyment lacks political maturity. Imperialist lust. I will report to the Presidium. This is not the time for self-criticism, my poor comrade. Come on, drink sodium bicarbonate. No, answer. Hello… Hello? Yes, line temporarily blocked. We apologize, ma'am. Here. Drink. Drink! Siberia! You can't just stop here like it's a service station! This is a state-run farm! You need a pass with a stamp in it. Mission order correctly stamped. Mission orders? So early? Let's see. I don't have my glasses. "Ministry of Agriculture, mission order: "Dorothy cow transfer for security reasons. "Minister of Agriculture, Jules Molinard." Your minister is not too talkative. Weird. "Dorothy cow transfer?" She's not going through so easy, Dorothy. I don't know you, either. -Do you know the password? -Niet. What did you say? Niet. No, that's not it. No cheating! But we have a stamped mission order. Not good enough! -Who is that? -Bouchard, agricultural engineer. Ah, hello sir. Not very chatty. What does he want? You, call. -To who? -To the minister. There's the number there. -At 5:00 am? -Ministers are always on call. That's news to me. I had no idea. Alright, well… Let's go. Well. We'll wake up your minister. I warn you though, if he doesn't know the password, I'll be applying a foolproof security system. Let's go. Hello? Who is it? Brigadier Batifol. I would like to speak to the Minister. The Minister? Minister of what? Hello? This is Molinard, the minister. To whom am I speaking? Brigadier Batifol. Apologies for waking you up so early, but I have Mr. Bouchard and two of your guys here. They want to take Dorothy. That's right, perfectly correct. But they don't have the password. -The password? -That's why I'm calling. No password, no Dorothy. And you, do you have the password? Of course, that's why I'm asking. What proof do I have that you know it? I wrote it there on a piece of paper. That's not proof. -No but… -Shut up! I'll believe you if you give it to me. Wait, apologies, sir… Silence! Watch out now! -Who called me? -I did. So it's up to you to give me the password. I'll wait. "Swallow." Very well. Now tell my men that I order them to give you the password immediately and without delay. The Minister orders you to give me the password immediately and without delay. Swallow! -Well? -It's done, Minister. Everything is fine. Enjoy the rest of your life, Minister. My regards. I congratulate you on your enthusiasm. There is something not quite right about all this. Put me through to the newlyweds' room. No, room five! How do you feel? Better. Much better. And you, your ankle? It was more of a scare than an injury. Come closer. Again? -Hello? Yes? -Hello? -Mr. Bouchard? -It's me. Come quickly to the laboratory, Dorothy's been kidnapped. What did you say? Hurry up. We are waiting for you, hurry up. I'm coming. What are you doing? Where are you going? Answer me. They kidnapped Dorothy. -François' girlfriend? -What girlfriend? -Dorothy! -Dorothy? No, not that one. Look, I'll explain. What a surprise! -Almost gone with the wind, eh? -Come on. Don't listen to him! -Go back to your room and don't move. -Are you crazy? -No, I'm quite sane. -He won't shoot. You never know, walk on. Watch it, okay! Just watch it! Watch it! Guns go off practically by themselves. Mind your own business! -Go, I'll deal with it. -Right. Stop or I'll shoot! Here, the cigarettes! Operation launched, Comrade Olga! Alcoholic employee! Degenerate! Bungler! You join me in trailer, understand? Da, Comrade Ivanov. "Da, Comrade Ivanov." Hands in the air. Watch out, this one's real! She's crazy! Hello? This is Agent E22, can you hear me? All right, agent R64 here. Speak up. Dorothy kidnapping attempt, warning system engaged. -Heading to Grignon. End of transmission. -OK, message recorded. Hello? Is that you, Nicole? How are you my darling? And the trip, how did it go? No air pockets? What? You're not in Italy? Where? At Bousseau? At the La Dauberie hotel. I'm on the way. -Mission accomplished, Comrade Ivanov. -Perfect, Comrade Petrossian. Now for the rest. He is very good, that little Markovich. Never a word too many. Okay, now let's take care of the package. Gently. Go on! Get in, you fool! Go on! My God! Okay, now I'm going to get Comrade Olga and will send you Comrade Smirnoff. -I don't need him. -He needs you! Understood? Siberia! Meet at the Trois Chênes Farm. No objection? Perfect! Execute! Cousin Valerie? Pull the other one! Her name is Dorothy. Mr. Valin surprised her at Michel's. -No! -And he's a private eye, not Jean's son. -A private investigator? -Yes. -By the way, where is he? -In the hotel. -Where? -I don't know. Wait there. I'll go get him. Tell me, Nicole, your wedding… Did you… Well… Has it been consummated? No! Thank the Lord! -Well, Comrade Smirnoff? -Mission accomplished, Comrade Ivanov. Perfect, Comrade Smirnoff. Comrade Olga's car isn't here yet? Niet, comrade Ivanov. Take mine and go to the Trois Chênes Farm and join Comrade Petrossian. I'd rather die. And that's what will happen if you don't carry out orders immediately. Well? Mission accomplished, Comrade Ivanov. Well, no thanks to you, Comrade Olga. You're still drunk as a skunk. Where are the comrades? They are in Richecourt. They're keeping the French scientists locked up at the Trois Chênes farm. And Dorothy? -The cow? -A cow? In a little bourgeois caravan. Oh, those fools! They didn't put her in her hiding place. Come lend a hand, Comrade Olga. Come on, get in! -Come on, be reasonable. -Go on! Push, Comrade Olga! Push, this is for the fatherland. If you're going to be a fool, at least toughen up. Pull partition. Capitalist cow! There! Now let's go. What about my car? Very good! A good point, Comrade Olga. -There. -What is that? Small time bomb. Clockwork mechanism, Besançon manufactured. Guaranteed! In two minutes, no more car. Boom! Go… You're crushing my leg, back up! I'm stuck! I'm stuck! Back up. My leg! Look what you did, you thug! We have to look underneath. The bike, no, not here, there… Put your back into it or I'll never get out. Underneath, there! Don't move, like that. There you go! Perfect. Don't move. I swear, Minister, that's what happened. What are you saying? Bouchard came to pick up his cow this morning at 5:00 a.m.? I didn't want to. I called the Ministry of Agriculture. Me? You never called me. Mr. Minister, with all due respect, when you phone the minister for agriculture at 5:00 a.m., you remember it! But why were you calling him? To get the password! What password? -Swallow. -Swallow? Swallow! I never said that word. I didn't know it existed. I thought as much! You tricked me! This guy is completely crazy! Let's keep a cool head, my dear colleague. Where is Bouchard? He's not there? Apparently not. It's been 15 minutes since I left him, he should be there. You were responsible for watching him and you abandon him! -To protect him. -Strange protection. The cow and the expert. Both of them. Hello? What are you saying? Everyone is looking for it and you have found it? Little joker! Call back the 1st of April. What? Who? -Valerie? -Who is it? A man named François Valin. Hello? Valerie speaking. Well done. The cow and Michel. -You've pulled it off. -What? -Who do you work for? -Aunt Berthe. Aunt Berthe? Please, try again. It's true, I'm a private investigator. Lovely profession. Dangerous, above all. But that is not what it's about. I know who kidnapped Michel and Dorothy. -You do? -The Russians. The Russians? Oh dear, sounds bad. Very bad. If we hurry up, we can still catch them. They're taking the cow to a caravan. -Where's Michel? -Locked in a farm. The big oaks farm, the three oaks… -In Richecourt. -In Richecourt? Surround the farm immediately. Call the army. What about the press, radio and TV while you're at it? Who's speaking? The Minister of the Interior. Mind your own business. Quickly, Bouchard is in danger. What matters above all is the cow. The specialist, we'll deal with later. But it's his wedding day. State interests take precedence over special interests. It's a scandal, shameful! Do we pay taxes to be murdered? If that's how it is, I'll deliver it on my own. Do not get yourself involved. Take care of this know-it-all. Hello, François? I beg you, don't do anything stupid. Where are you? -In a gas station office. -Where? What? Oh, sorry. -Where are we? -Crécy-sur-Meule. In Crécy-sur-Meule. In Crécy-sur-Meule? Don't move, I'm coming. -Valerie! -Yes. Bring me pants. -Pants? -When you see me, you'll understand. That's it. -What do you mean "pants"? -He needs a pair. Bonvoisin, give me your pants. -Mine? -That's right. Why's it always me? And careful, miss. No messing up. If in an hour the cow isn't collected, we don't know anything or anyone. Neither you, nor Bouchard, nor that weirdo on the phone. No one, is that clear? Perfectly. They're a bit big, aren't they? -You don't have any suspenders? -I don't need them. I never wear any. You? Do you have any suspenders? -Yes. -Well, hand them over. -But my pants will fall down. -You'll hold them. That's an order. -Did you hear me? -Yes, sir. In an hour, it's every man for himself. Here. Brigadier, only you have seen the kidnappers. Go to the four roads blockade and report them to all your colleagues. Get going! Hi? Yes, it's me, Nicole. Who is this? François? Where are you? Hi? Mrs. Cambassou, here. What is going on? Michel was kidnapped. She can't have been too upset. -Who? -Dorothy. Dorothy is a cow. That is a bit harsh, but you're right. He's as guilty as she is. Dorothy is an actual cow! Are you not feeling well? -I'm in great shape. -Doesn't sound like it. Look, Michel was kidnapped by the Russians. -Russians? -They're after his cow. What cow? Dorothy! What do you mean? Explain yourself. It would take too long. Trust me. Reassure Nicole, we'll find him. Oh, and most importantly, don't move from the hotel. Here you go, pants and suspenders. Thank you. Valerie! You don't blame me? -We'll see when we find Michel. -Right. POLICE STOP -Documents, please. -Yes, documents. What's going on there? -A cow was stolen. -A cow? All these police out just for a cow? -Yes. -We aren't in India, though. -Here. -Excuse me. Could you open your passport for me? I have to hold onto my pants. Are you afraid your pants will also be stolen? No, I lent my suspenders. And you didn't get them back. Always the same. Me, I never lend anything. Here. -Is your name Goldfinger? -Yes, Goldfinger. Are you Swiss? Yes, from the canton of Vaud. It's not a calf. It's a cow. How fun! What's all this about? It's my wife. -Your wife? -Yes. She's the one going "moo". -"Moo"? -Yes. Let me explain. She suffered a trauma. From a car? No, from a cow. One day, in Switzerland, she was almost trampled by a herd and since then, every time someone mentions a cow or a calf, she moos. -Seriously? -Yes. You see? The poor woman. Mind you, that doesn't surprise me, because one day I was bitten by a police dog. You were in civilian clothes, perhaps? No, why? Nothing, carry on. Well, since then, as soon as there's a storm, I growl. -You what? -I growl. -Ah, you growl. -Yes, I growl. But you've never bitten anyone? -No, no. -My wife, it's the same. She moos but has never produced milk. Well? Oh, I sense there's going to be a thunderstorm. Go ahead. I'll take care of him. Remove the harrows! Not so fast, little man. Well, nervous? Perhaps you don't have a clear conscience. Something to hide, eh? Come on, get out! Your documents! And that? Isn't that to pull a trailer, eh? -That thing? -Yes. -It holds my bumper on. -Yeah? Take it off. My bumper will fall off. -We'll pick it up. Go on! -Wow! Pull a caravan with a wire? Only a gendarme would come up with that idea. If we did this to you at your wedding, how would you like it? I want to see my wife, do you hear? I'll leave you the cow, the formulas, but bring me my wife! Oh, I've had enough of this! Big storm in his head. Overflowing bourgeois sentimentality. There you go, my bumper's on the road. Are you satisfied? Uh, my wire? Confiscated. Confiscated? How do I hold my bumper? No talking back or I'll give you a ticket for refusal to comply. Go on! These guys, I swear, they're worse than contract workers. Remove the harrows. Hey there! Careful! Where are you going? Where the wind blows. -And when there is no wind? -I stop. You're a smart one. Your documents. There you go, officer. Identity card, large family, disability, veteran, priority, film club, society for the protection of animals, this one is out of date and at the bottom, it's a postcard. Like that. No driving license? Yes, there you are, sir. Here it is. Traveled a lot, eh? That's what permits are for. -Profession? -Delivery man. -Delivery man? -No, delivery man. -Oh right, delivery man. -There. Hey, what's going on there! Nothing. What is that? Oh, it looks like a gentleman! Why, it's the expert! What's the meaning of this? Do you deliver scientists? You know, I deliver anything as long as I get paid. If you have enough to buy yourself an expert, I will deliver him to you. But I don't want one. That's too bad, they're highly sought after. I know, the ministers have been chasing him all morning. This is an opportunity to take advantage of. I'll write your name in my delivery book. -Your name? -Batifol. Batifol, fine. Profession? Well, sergeant. That's not a profession. I will put "gendarme". Where do you live? -In Mamadou-des-Yvettes. -In Mamadou… Where is that? -In Martinique. -Martinique? Are you sure? That is where I was born. This is no proof! Do you have… Do you have your documents? -My documents? -Yes. Ah well, no. I left them in my civvies. So you walk around without any documents and in civilian clothes. That could cost you dearly, my dear man. -It's my first time. -They always say that. Go on, but watch it! Don't let it happen again or I won't be so lenient. Take care of yourself! Stand down! What's the meaning of this? My word, is he giving me orders? What are you doing? I'm packing up my expert, since you don't want him. I'm the one packing you up! You can explain yourself to the minister. You are a touchy one. Yes, very touchy. You, there. That gendarme did not have much under his chapka. Lucky for us. Oh, they put them everywhere! It's an epidemic. We have caught ourselves a gendarme. One will have to do, though. Not all of them were bitten by a police dog. And that cow that keeps mooing whenever we stop! None of this good, Comrade Olga. We will have to try something different. Too bad, let's try to reach the castle of Comrade Ambassador. -I'm turning right. -Deviationism! Okay, so left. Oh dear… Are we going to wait here a long time? The minister was right. I'm not bothering anymore. You don't know who you're dealing with! Sounds like a car. Ah, a bit less cocky now, eh! -Your turn. -No, you go. -No you. -No you! Hey! You don't expect me to go, do you? We are being watched. But he's gone. I hadn't noticed. What was it? Erotic-bourgeois automobile effusion. Depressing spectacle. Well, they must have fun where you're from, when they make babies. How many are there? Two. That's all? Yes. What are we doing? Comrade Ivanov is late. He won't come now. Your comrade was picked up. Little trouble, miss? You scared me. Hey, I'm tired! You bastard. I'll give you a piece of my mind! -No need to take it like that. -You can settle this later. -We have to get the cow. -Damn the cow. I want my wife. He deserves his wedding night. What did they do to you? Answer your little wife. Don't you want to answer your wife? It's not that he doesn't want to, it's that he can't. Alas. What happened to him? Frankly, we don't know. He is in no position to tell us. I don't understand, François just called us. François? What François? A private detective I hired to watch my future nephew. Oh, yes? If I may ask, madam, why watch him? Let's say for sentimental reasons. And what did the private eye tell you? -That the Russians kidnapped him. -What? -Russians? -Yes. -Funny idea. You're sure? -Certainly, yes. Russians. Why would they have kidnapped him? For some cow. It gets better. -Bouchard works under your orders? -Yes. You didn't know about this? -Absolutely not. -He was working in secret? Dear madam, we do not do secret work with cows. By the way, we've been invited to His Excellency Vinogradov's farewell garden party. -The Soviet ambassador. -We will be well positioned to assure you of the meaninglessness of this private detective's words. Please excuse us, duty calls. -Ladies. -Ladies. Bouchard's amnesia is a stroke of luck. Yes, but this detective story worries me. What if he found the cow? Unlikely. We'll say that we have nothing to do with it, that it is a set-up. I admire your optimism. You mean realism, my friend. A cow does not speak. And Bouchard, do you know his condition? He didn't react in front of his wife. Nicole, behave like a lady. -This is my husband. -Not yet. Alas. And it's your fault, with your incessant suspicions. Your Machiavellian ideas. I've had enough. I want to live. You hear? Live with my husband. Without burdening myself with prejudices that weigh you down. -Nicole! -Come on, darling. -What will you do? -My marital duties. In his condition? But Nicole, where are you going? -Far from here. -You can't drive. We will hitchhike. Oh, the boss! He came to comfort my wife, that's nice. Oh, my darling, at last. Darling, I understand your impatience, but calm down! He's not wasting any time! -My car! -Nicole! My word, he's driving. Pinch me. Hurry up! Michel! François! Wait for me! François! Wait for me, will you! Oh dear! If madam permits, I would be happy to drive her. Do you think it possible to be in two places at the same time? -No. -Let's see. Sorry. Excuse me, dear ladies, urgent business. What does that mean? We had a little complication, Comrade Excellence. We had to change plan at the last minute. Are you crazy bringing this cow to me in the middle of a reception? Thank you. French ministers! Make that cow disappear. Do you hear me, Colonel? I don't want a diplomatic incident. Certainly, as you command, Comrade Excellence. Olga, bring the little beast over here. Nicole! My darling! -Michel! -My love! There is your nephew. There are two of them. One, two. Bouchard? -Bouchard? -Still? Sir, I'm sure Dorothy is here. Do you know these people? Well, sir, yes. The gentleman works at the ministry. As a clerk. A clerk? I am an agricultural engineer! -I assure you, the cow is here. -The cow? What cow? Never mind. Simply there were rumors circulating suggesting that a great foreign power and ally intended to bring to our country an extraordinary cow producing more than 200 liters of milk per day. This, apparently, meant to jeopardize the success of the common market. I understand. A ministry hoax. This is not a hoax. The Russians kidnapped my cow. -What? -I don't want a diplomatic scandal. No scandal? Enough, Bouchard. You are fired. And is that a hoax? My cow! This must be an advertising campaign for a milk brand. Funny advertisement! Stupidly clever, right? Get that cow. Bring it down, do you hear me? Bring it down! -I'll bring it down. -No, not like that, you fool. I warned you, I no longer know you! You are fired, expatriated, wiped off the cards. Siberia! Political asylum! If you want, I'll get it back. The pilot is a friend of my sister's boyfriend. No need, we no longer require your services. Human ingratitude! TO THE MIRACLE COW A Dorothy special! Boss, your specials are being snapped up. Ten coffee beans for 50 grams of food and three centigrams of caffeine extract with hormones equals… Keep chatting, ladies. The customers are getting impatient. Four Dorothys, a special Bouchard… Found it! Ten grams of coffee for 50 grams of food plus three centigrams of pure caffeine. What do you get? A cream coffee! And a fortune! Done! It's over. Come on, don't push. Little Dorothy is not a factory. Ah, the crowd! THE END Subtitle translation by: Christopher Ward
