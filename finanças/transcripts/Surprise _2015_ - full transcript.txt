- Oh...I didn't hear you to come up. - Didn't you have practice this afternoon? - Ah, no... The coach cancelled it. - Do you want me to make you something to eat? - I'm not hungry. - You are dieting, mom? - I'm not! Of course not. Why? Are you worrying about that? - I don't know... No... You look very nice tonight. Oh...are you going back with dad or something...? - No. Why do you ask? - Because you're acting psych Stop! - Ah...No Jack, your dad and I are not getting back together again Ever! In fact, I'm not looking for being dating any man. - It makes sense. - Really? - Sure. Engage is a way hard. - Do you remember Cassie? - Sure. She was a nice girl. - No, she sucks. She still don't go out with me. Why're you laughing? This is serious. I really like this girl. - Yes, I can see that you do Jack... I need to explain something to you. -Mom...I know about the birds and the beees... - I know you do... Hmm...well... Love is complicated, you know? And... and...as you get older and... have more experience and...and...and... things change. Well, you know... sometime you just... sometime just seems that you have a personality transplant... but you haven't really, it's just that... you...you evolve into a more multi...faceted person.... - Do you understand? - Totally. - So, let's say, hypothetically,... that you know someone really well, a woman and she's decided that she is attracted to women, that she wants even want to date a woman. - You mean...we're talking about gays. that...I mean...lesbians - Hu, hu... Oh, my god! No way! Cassie! She is a lesbian! That's why she is not going out with me. - No...that's not what... -Oh, you are a genious! ... I'm trying to tell you... - Cassie is definetely lesbian. I mean, nothing else makes sense. I can't wait to tell Sam. - Hmm....so... how're you doing in Miss Cromwell's class? Are you liking her more? - I'm gonna... Do you like her more? She is a turd, mom. - Hey, don't talk about Alice...! - Alice...!? Jeez! I didn't know you two've become bfs. - Well...hmm... We've talked a couple of times...a few times since the parents-teachers conference and... ... that's all. No... really that's not all. I've talked to her a lot. Look you know, I know it's not fair just spring this on you before Alice comes over - Wha...What? Why she didn't just call? - She did call Jack. That is what I'm trying to tell you. - Are you fucking with me? - Hey, watch your language. - You know! - You, what? Well, fine. We'll just talk about it over dinner with Alice. - Dinner !? What? Why is Cromwell coming over for dinner? - Well... Over the last few months, Alice and I have become closer and she is really... she has become part, a big. big, big part of my personal life... and I... - Wait, hold on, I'm sorry... Your personal life? - The romantic side? - Holy crap! No... no... no... No...no...no, no, no, no....no, no, no, no! Are you like...fucking?- - Hey, watch your mouth. Oh honey, I know this is probably a little traumatic Do you need to talk with someone? No Jack. You can't! You can't tell anyone about this. - I won't. I mean...maybe...Sam. - No, not Sam! No one...not yet. - When? - I will...I don't know...we will, will talk to Alice about that we will make up our minds and then shown up... - Mà! I've to tell you something. - Sure. Anything! - Right... I was at school and then...I wasn't. Get dismissed. - Dismissed? - Yeah...like...the same thing as... Expelled. - Expelled? You expelled? Why didn't the school call me? - Mom...it... - Oh yeah, they're dead. Now is Alice, she is almost here. What did you do, Jack? - Well, I was talking in the cafetería just like anyone else and then the teacher singled me out it's like...really unfair. - Okay, wait, that's Alice. We'll talk about this later. - But...I...mà! I called your girlfriend "cunt".
