They're showing something new at our cinema at eight. Wanna go? OK. Whose treat? Whoever loses. - They met in Matrix. - Neo, Trinity and Morpheus. And what size is your idol, Nicholas Cage? You bastard! 8MM. And how much time does he need? Only 60 seconds. Who is Zed? Zed's dead, baby. Zed is dead! Game over. Son, your punishment is to watch Pulp Fiction 20 times on DVD... And buy us 2 tickets to the movies. At least I'm not a poor dude! A bucket of popcorn and a barrel of Coke, please. Hi. Sorry for being late, A client's hard disk crashed and it took me a while. And you made a ton of money again? I pulled in 200, it's my treat for pizza after the movie. With me you could make that much in a sec if you only wanted to. Knock it off. You know that's not me. I wouldn't be able to sleep at night. I guarantee you'll sleep just fine... in a cool pad... and with a different chick every day. Get real, you know that's not me. - Girls don't hurl themselves at me. - They will when you're loaded. THE HACKER Production Designer Executive Producer Good morning, Mr. Linda. Sonny, God damn it, I told you not to call me that! Hello... oh, hi there! Aha, alright, I'll turn it on. On which channel? Sound It's not my fault you look so much like him... Music So what? Who cares if Mateo Canetti, the big fashion guru... that's nothing new. Bye... talk to you later. Editor - Hi, Dad. - Hi... and bye. - Water the plants. - Yes, Mother. Oh, you! Written by Based on the story and idea of Director of Photography Boarding School No 11 Produced by If I'd dropped so many chips in Vegas they'd take me home in a stretch limo. A little class, you fuck! Directed by - Faster, guys. - It won't go in! Hold the teddy. God, it's big. You'll have to take your bra off.

If you give me a hand at hacking, I'll pass you the bone on ...how to make Laura come on to you. - No. She's just after the bank. She'll do it with the one who has a big wad. Don't say that! I'm sure she's not like that. Wanna make a bet? If you do everything that I say, Laura will be yours in 5 days - at the latest. You're fucked up, d'you know that? - Wanna bet or not?

So, for 5 days you're my hacker, But after that... she will be yours. This is your seat, dear. My beloved, dear children- in the name of our school board I would like to welcome you to your graduation exams. I would also like to warmly welcome one of our most senior teachers, Mr Hearing-Aiderman - accompanied today by his wife - who traditionally holds a vigil over our exams in the name of our patrons. Please pay attention now, I shall start to dictate your assignment. Solve the following equation: - Three times... - Three times... - Open bracket... - The natural logarithm... - Of the integer, two... - Minus... - The natural logarithm of "x..." - Close bracket... The whole bracket to the power of 2. Close bracket, close bracket- minus seven-equals zero. OK? Lookin' hot there, fly girl! Mom, I told you not to call me. Yes, I know the flowers are very important. Mom, we don't live in the Sahara to water them every 15 minutes. I'm giving you the solution now... Three times - open bracket - natural logarithm of two, squared - minus 2 times the natural logarithm of 2 - times the natural logarithm of x. - Repeat after "logarithm", Marcin. - Don't call me by my name! Very well. Very well. Open bracket-the natural logarithm of two, squared... - Two times the natural logarithm... - Charles! Have you ever seen... heard... anything like this? The logarithm of "x" plus logarithm of "x" squared, close bracket. Marcin! My dear boy! Good. Very good! Yes, that's my best pupil in grade eleven, Makowski. Hello Marcin - can you hear me? Yes... What on earth are you saying? Just don't mess up, OK? Congratulations in advance for acing your finals. Careful with the teddy bear. Hello, Makowski, can you hear me? I don't know where you're hiding, but you're history. My hearing aid! We're waiting, Makowski. Who? I forgot. Then forget as well that you ever attended this school. Well... who? Nobody. Your colleague just sentenced himself. This is from the principal. - Passed? - Passed! Forget about her. D'you know how many chicks are out there? Anyway, we have more wicked things to do. Yeah, like what? Hacker's things. Isn't it, Brutus? Kosa, you're slacking off... You still owe me two big ones. - Boss, I have a problem. - You don't have any problems yet. You're still a lucky man. But you will have a predicament if I don't see that money. I can't make it. Credit cards everywhere. No one pays cash. Authorizations... I don't know where to find it. So find out. I'm giving you a week. And if I can't, what? Will you cut off my right hand? - Worse. - Both of my hands? Worse. Both hands and blow off my kneecaps? Worse. OK. My hands, my knees, and in the end... my balls? Worse, Kosa. Much worse... Well, what? Gonna unleash Brutus on me? You'll simply rot in the slammer with Dick and Hairy, who just happen to be looking for a sausage jockey for the summer. Wham! Well, d'you wanna be my swanky buddy yet? I told you a hundred times. I just can't do this. You promised that you'd hack for me. What d'you say to this? Central Government Web Site Did you forget who's the master of the net? Well, who? - Winnie-the-Pooh. - Good. - And who's Winnie-the-Pooh's friend? - Tigger. - And what do Tiggers love most? - Hacking. - Ready? - Just a sec. - Let's dance. - Let's dance. I wonder what Laura is doing now. Right now? Probably shakin' rump with that horn dogger. You're mental, bro. I'm sure she's asleep. Yeah, right. And her mom is tucking in her blanket and reading her Little Red Riding Hood. - Game over! - Far out, dude! Prime Minister "Pooh" and Minister of Finance "Tigger." Right on, Mac! You win... but this thing keeps crashing - you had better chances. - D'you wanna try mine? - No, no. You're a wicked hacker. You'll win a Nobel Prize one day, and I'll take over Hollywood. And we'll get a real grip on the bank. The fashion show was fabulous. Hi boys, the show was unbelievable! - Too bad you didn't see it. - Hi boys. Unbelievable! You definitely have to watch it on TV. And tomorrow my report will be on air too. You forgot the plants again! Do you want them to die? You're never at home anyway. When you finally make it to college, you won't have to water them anymore. Are you gonna switch to cactuses? Hello, did you see the show? Yeah, unbelievable... so was I... It sucks having parents like them. At least you have some. Don't trip, orphan. If you want, we'll fuckin' adopt you! I'm sorry, - Mac - Mac Fly - that was a stupid joke. They threw me out of school. What? Why didn't you tell me before? The principal found out I was helping someone. I didn't tell him it was her ...so he expelled me. - The principal? Wait a second! If you want to graduate, be at my office tomorrow at 8. What do you need school for? You spend 12 years there, right? But teachers only allocate about 5 or 6 minutes a day to you personally. - Right? - I guess. Times five days per week, that's about 30 minutes. You get me? - I'm in suspense, dude. - That may not be enough... Times 40 weeks of school per year, gives us what? 1,200 minutes. - Times 12 years, is... - 14,400. Divide that by 60 and you get the number of hours - which comes to 240. - How many days? - 10 days. 10 days out of 12 years of school! Not bad, huh? So what do you need school for? With your brain we'll make more in 1 night than others in their whole life! Your principal has just sentenced himself... It'll be da bomb when the shit hits the fan! What's up? They threw me out of school ...and out of the dorm. Don't worry. The army will take you in. - That's just the problem. - You can shack up with me for now. But remember, boy, the army gives a man character. It'll do you good. I can learn to smoke and drink someplace else. Sonny, don't talk about things you don't understand. Way back, during military exercises, we got an order to assault some positions that were fortified as hell. The enemy headquarters were there. The mission was impossible. I told our commanding officer how we could really massacre the 16th, but the son-of-a-bitch wouldn't agree. So we doused him with 80-proof at night, and crept around the side of the enemy's defenses. Their headquarters from behind while they were having breakfast. - What does this have to do with me? - Remember, boy. If you can't get in through the front, try getting in from behind. - 80-proof. - 100! - Hi! - Hi, it's good that you came. - Where's your buddy? - Why, do you miss him? Maybe. I ended up with a "B+" average and wanted to thank him. - And don't I get a reward? - We never said anything about money. I'll gladly accept payment in kind, but only in 4 days. Why, are you having your period? Besides, it was him who solved the problems. And got kicked out of school. - Can I get you something? - No thanks. D'you know what the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is? The best computer science faculty in the world. Marcin's dream. He would've made it there, he sure has the brains, but... Stop that crap! Remember how it was? You got him involved in this. If I'd admitted it was him, we would both have got expelled. You know that, so don't heap all the blame on me. Nobody's perfect. - Who's that dick? - He helped me pass my exams. And now he wants something. - It's not your thing, Daniel. - OK, OK, not my thing... What are you doing? High school principal was suspended of his duties today after he had demanded sexual favors from one of his students. Other pupils told us the principal had always become more active in his relations with youth in times of final exams. According to unnamed sources, while still a teacher of mathematics at a technical school, he had lured his female students into a photo lab where disguised as the school's principal, he had slapped their intimate body parts with a ruler. Outrageous! Absolutely not true! I won't have any TV reports of this! Laura W., the student in question passed her exams with a "B+". Our congratulations. She could've worn those skimpy rags to the final. The principal would've given her an "A+" right away. Instead, look what happened... She's really got you tricked, huh? There's that asshole again. You only have 4 days left to win our bet! The loudest applause was for the lingerie collection. Why did you turn it off? All I need is her to tell me to water the plants. My dear son, don't forget to water our plants. I can say with complete authority that hackers in Poland do not pose a credible threat. Those who do operate are... harmless amateurs. How would you comment on the hacking into the government's web site? - Those were just two harmless kids. - Two? - Amateurs. - Yeah, right. In that case, why did restoring the site's original contents take 24 hrs? I don't get it. It was supposed to last less than an hour. After you left, I screwed things up so bad, ...it took them all day to fix it. - Are you out of your mind? - You want to dive in shit? - Is that a hacker talking? A hacker breaks in for a trip and not to wreck anything. Or to kick their asses. This is war! It's us on one side, and them on the other. Did you hear those lies? - Does that mean you know who did it? - We identified them based on how - they named the government officials. - Are there any further questions? And what if hackers broke into the Central Election Committee's server? There's nothing to worry about. The Pooh will not become president! Two bags... For sure. It'll be two big ones. Boss - it'll be two big ones. - Your ID please. - Alright, give my regards to Brutus. Mr. Officer, I'm just quietly sittin' here, doin' nothing... Well, that's just it. Didn't you see the sign? That'll cost you 200 zlotys, and three to five points. In that case, I would propose... 50 and my oath to become a better driver. Oath accepted, and I'll let you get off with a warning this time. Thank you for your reprimand. Learning is a lifelong pursuit! - Brewsky? - No. Your old lady called. Water the flowers. The philodendron, too. Here you go! Hang in there, Mac. You're a sad sight. Maybe we could take in Back to the Future? - I don't think so. - That's the first time you said no... It really is bunk with you. You only have 3 days left. Hello. Hello, hello! Laura sent us. Is there anyone home? - Oh hi, are you Turbo? - No. So you're Marcin. Sit down guys; this is a surprise from Laura! Sit down! What about me? Far out! A million bucks! Turbo! There's a million bucks to win! - Mac Fly, the girls are in heat! - Give me a break! The redhead's for you. She does a wicked hummer. I'll send her to you by e-mail. Look. - Prefer the blonde? OK, I'll trade. - Turbo, look! - Some kind of a bank? - Some... some class act, man! Just look at the stakes! They want you to break into two designated servers, and decipher a file protected by an algorithmically ...encrypted password. - What type of key? - 48 bit. - By my reckoning you'll need 1,000 hours or more. Gonna call Einstein? Don't insult me. What do we have the net and parallel processing for? Are you thinking universities? Data processing centers? It's a mystery! What does Julius Caesar has in common with Hungary? Wait a second... Julius Caesar... Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon, saying The die is cast... Rubicon... Rubik's Cube! Yes! - Who won the competition? - What competition? - You know, the Four Hills... - Adam Malysz. I'm talking about last night. I'm sure I heard one of the girls shout you went over the edge the wrong way. But I landed with a telemark anyway. In the second series, I must've got it on real' sweet. The black-haired gave me 19 points. Anyway, how's it going? It's a fortress, a real classic: Triple firewall, impossible to breach. - Did you try emacs through sendmail? - They only took me into a fake system Exploits? No faults whatsoever. We have to figure out something else. In that case, I wish you a pleasant flight. - Marcin? - Yeah. - Remember our bet? - Yeah. Clock this - I have a little surprise. Take a look at number 17. - De Lorean. - Overnight delivery - our wheels! - It's beyond our means. - We can win this auction. - How and with what? - We'll find a way... What are you up to? Not me. You. You're hacking Laura, the fortress. Stop that, Laura isn't some program. - There's not a crack on her. - Sure there is! Ever lived in a palace? Well, you're going to. Laura will definitely fall for a palace. Turbo, give it up. Its the ninth dumpster. Whella! Right on! I have everything I need - the card number, account number, name... That's just what I was afraid of. I told you, there's always a sucker who throws stuff like this into trash. Wow! Almost like your orphanage! - Let's bail before it's too late. - Trippin' again? - Or have you given up on Laura? - Of course not, but... So, chill out. They got our bank guarantees and the palace is ours. You can live on the top floor. - Make yourself at home. - I never had a home. Well, now you do, and it's a sweet crib! We'll set up our stuff and keep an eye on the whole palace. And this is where you'll triumph over her last firewall. You should have enough water. - You're so full of shit. - Visionary, I'd say. Awesome bed. New wave. Lie down on her and you don't have to wait for earthquakes! The Hacker's Manifesto! Every code can be broken Break in there where no one's spoken. Information craves to be free. The fault is always with the M-l-S trustee! There's no future without computure. See Mac Fly - all this equipment? D'you know how much paper you'd have to cough up for it? Instead, all we do is "click" and we've got it - and we'll get even more. Look over there. Man, I'm on a roll! I'll hook everything up to watch you night and day from my crib just like Big Brother Big Brother always shows up in a big palace. - Where's my dough? - I don't have it yet... - But I will. - I want it within 3 days. One more thing - see these two punks? I want them working for me. Maybe you'd like to drop by this evening? Would you drop by tonight? Maybe you'd like to drop by this evening? Would you drop... - Hello. - Whad'ya want? - I'd like to talk to Laura. - What about? I wanted to... that is, I wanted to invite her to a party. Hi. What's the big deal? It's my old man. My old man! Are you free tonight? I'm having a little party. Drop by - it'll be pretty cool. Here's the address - it's easy to find. You look fab. Welcome - on Marcin's behalf. - Cool pad. Did you win the lottery? - No, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. There's costumes on the racks; grub and adult beverages on the side tables. It's self-service. - He's with me. - Still? - What about it? - Nothing, come on in. I saw you on TV, dude, nice panties you had on there. Could you get me some of those? But I'd prefer men's briefs. And look who's talking. A third-rate Nicholas Cage wannabe. Break it up, boys, we came here to have some fun. Laura? Hey man! Bro! I couldn't help noticing you snagged Laura. Man! Tell me, how'd you do it? Romantically, spontaneously. And be cool. That's why I'll never get a girl. You know? I think I'm too shy. Look around. Do you realize what you see? Beautiful, lonely girls. And do you know what their eyes are saying? "Date me. Take me to the movies." You bunker: They're burning with desire for you, and you tell me you're shy. It's exactly shy guys like you who condemn these honeys to some steroid-muscled dickwads. Go and bag a chick right now. Charge! - Do you love boxing? - Sure, baby. - How much do you love boxing? - Just as much as you. A chemical laser, in which fluoride and hydrogen react with each other. That's how hydrogen fluoride came... Gotta love boxing. Add optical prisms and mirrors to that and you get... D'you wanna fuck? - Where are you running? - To the can. Men's room is that way. I know, but Pocahontas promised me to show me her Mohican tuft. And now, you vultures, it's time for a toast. Our host is turning 18 today. Matrix. No, Laura. Well, you've got your blowjob done! Fine champagne... but where's the brewsky? Have any fallen? Once, when I was little. But my wish didn't come true. Later they said in the news that the Russians lost a Sputnik. I believe that one will fall tonight, and it won't be a Sputnik this time. The star is talking about stars... Don't be silly. I know you wanted to go to college, and I acted like a coward. I'm sorry. Do you have a grudge against me? Yeah... for bringing it up. This party by the pool... Did you win all of this in a lottery, or did you rob a bank? - I made a bet. - What about? - That you can't buy everything. - Interesting bet. Did you win? I don't know yet. The worst part is that even if I win, I'll still lose. - You're speaking in riddles. - It's a habit, I guess. When you sit at the computer for 14 hours a day, you don't even realize you start encoding your thoughts. My parents want me to study French philology. I can help you at the entrance exams. Thanks, I was always good at French. Keep the groove on, Mac. - Great party, just like in Hollywood. - Who's this? I haven't had such fun in my life. And you're working here while everyone else is dancing? The groove's by the pool, man. But I wanted to party with you. - What is this? I don't know you! - But I know you, pal. Adam Nowak. Turbo to his friends. Hacker. Last break-in: Central government web site; fake bank guarantees thanks to which you rented these fine digs; and theft of computer and audio-video equipment worth 385,200.63 zlotys. What's all this for? - My buddy fell in love. - We'll talk about miseries later on. Her? She's fine... Let me guess, He's Marcin Makowski? Yeah. And chicks, as you know, head straight for the bank. Yet what a shame it would be if two young, talented boys spent their lives - as a friend of mine says - rotting in the slammer in the clutches of... awful thought, It doesn't matter. I've come here on a friendly mission. Actually, a favor for a favor: I scratch your back, you scratch mine! Then turn around, I can't reach that far. I'm the joker around here. Now decide: Are you in on this? Can you answer on your own, or do you want to call... ...your little pal's crisis hotline? I don't understand. You see, I have this store in mind. Here's the address. But they have cameras everywhere, and I don't want to be a TV star, 'cause it just doesn't pay enough! So what are you saying? I turn off the cameras while you snake the cashiers? What cashiers, pal? A package of Pampers. Well-maybe two. OK? OK? Wham! Yes! Come on, let's get groovin'. Come on, man. Get down with it - get groovin' boy. I have other plans now. The catwalk... have you ever been at a fashion show? There'll be quite a gig on Thursday. Laura! Where are you hiding out? We're outta here! Just a sec! You didn't tell me it was your 18th birthday. Stupid... coming without a present... - That's OK. - Laura! - Happy Birthday... - Thanks. She gave me... a phone number! I don't stand a chance with Laura. She's half an inch taller than me. But you're still growing, and you'll play in the NBA. - Lend me your shoes. - Buy some yourself. You can afford a 1000 pairs of the finest cowboy boots with thick inserts But I look OK with contact lenses? Much better! You looked like a moron in those frames. - I can't get used to them. - Life is full of pain. When Cage's hairline started to recede, I pulled half a million hairs out of my scalp. D'you know how much that hurt? Real love calls for sacrifice. Be happy you don't look like Marlon Brando, you'd have to pack on ...about 200 pounds! - Yeah. - I'm starving. Let's order a pizza. - Yeah. - Or two. - Yeah. What error?! Damn! Did you see the entire show? I wasn't interested in fashion 'til today. But you've started dressing differently. What about your bet? It still hasn't played out. Whats up with Daniel? We're not seeing each other. Time out? More like breach of contract. What contract? Women have their secrets too! Did you hear? Mateo's coming! Awesome! To our agency? He blew us off and went to a horse auction. Maybe next time. See ya'. - Who's Mateo? - Milan fashion designer. A guru. Working for him is like you studying at MIT. Then grab the opportunity. Meet with him... Are you kidding? Only cover girls work with him. - I don't have a chance. - You know what? I'll help you. You're sweet. But you don't have a chance either. Yeah? Dig this! The second firewall has been breached. Laura will be mine! Mine! Do you hear that? Sit down. Turbo, what is this? What's up? - How come you're so quiet? - Hands up! Who is this? We're pals. I'm Kosa, and you... Wait, let me guess... Marcin the orphan. My sympathies. Sit down. Cheers! But what's this about? Well boys, 'fact is, you've been... ...up to quite a shit lately. Now, I'm a really tolerant fellow. I understand people's misdemeanors. So I'm only asking for a little favor, a tiny favor, A teeny-tiny little hacking favor. A simple click, click, click, And there is darkness. D'you know what you got us into, you tool! The guy's a gangster! I don't know how they found us... I told you, you shouldn't have done that! And look who's talking! You are living in a palace, hacking on the tightest equipment. Have you paid a dime for this? - Nice to live off others, isn't it? - This is all just for Laura! Gonna tell that to the police? If Kosa doesn't smoke us by himself, he'll set the cops on our asses. We won't get out of joint for years. One foot in the grave, and the other up shit creek! So what does he want? To turn off the cameras in a store he wants to do. And then he'll want to turn off the lights in all Warsaw, or derail a train, or who knows what. The guy's a psycho! Lets win million bucks, pay him off and send him to hell. You'll never win. And in 2 days I'll be nailin' Laura. - And why exactly did you call me? - I saw you on TV, and I thought... Alright, alright. Since you called me, don't act on your own. - Pardon? - I'm proposing you a deal. I'll turn a blind eye to your little crimes, and you'll help me out. - And if I don't? - Then I'll just have to... ...arrest you. Lately I've only been getting offers I can't refuse. Yeah... Forget-me-nots? Beautiful! - Where did you buy them? - They grow near my place. - You picked them for me? - I was kind of bored. And that's why you dropped by the show? I wanted to take a few shots of you. Why do these shows turn you on? D'you really wanna know? Everyone is watching me. - You're frank. - I like the catwalk. I like looking good, meeting new people. I'd like to... I'd like to see the whole world. Is that a bad thing? It depends at what price. How much is a show at Mateo's worth to you? Are you starting to get interested in fashion? In you. Go now, Marcin. Why? Did I say something wrong? Just go, please. - Marcin, it's here! - What's here? The thing we bought at the auction! Laura, where are you? Stay there, I'll be in the parking lot in 30 min. Don't ask any questions... in 15 minutes... please. Let's roll! Hop in, girl. But this is the car from Back to the Future! Remember that movie? De Lorean. V6 engine, 200 horsepower, 0-60 mph in 5 seconds. Riveted construction... aerospace technology... and a Formula One power train. During my elementary school, I had a crush on Michael J. Fox. I must have seen it about 30 times. I've seen it 87 times. So there is something we have in common... Where did you get this ride? Just don't tell me you won the bet. Not yet. Tomorrow. Tomorrow I'll find out everything. - Here. - How did you do this? How did you do this? It's no big deal - with the right equipment. - They look so real. - Yeah, and Mateo will think the same. - Come on... - What do you have to lose? - It's fraud. - And your exam wasn't? He won't be at the agency... That's why we're going to see him. Get in. Get in, get in. What about me? Why are you so pale? - Where did you learn to drive? - In the video arcade! God, it's him... A beautiful car. I speak Polish... I was here a thousand times. What, Back to the Future? Oh, I'm Mateo. Mateo Canetti. Mac. Mac Fly. Did you come here to buy something, Mac? No not really, I just blew a lot of cash at Monte Carlo. But then again... But this time I won't let you beat me to it. - This is Laura. - Mateo. Laura. Bellissima... you have a beautiful girlfriend! - Sister. Marcin is my brother. - Excellent. My sister. Really? Really? You now have before you entry No 11. Thoroughbred Arabian stallion Enigma. Sired by the famous stud Castrate and foaled by Frigidity, he is 4 years old with an excellent pedigree. His reserve price is 25 thousand. Who would like to open the bidding? Six... Eight. - So you posed for Joop? - Yes, a couple of times. - Eight and a half. Fellini. - Nine. Antonioni. - And who's your agent? - She just fired him. Thirty! - Do you mind if I keep the pictures? - That's fine. Thirty-one. Thirty-two Thirty-two and a half. - Are you crazy? - Easy, I know what I'm doing. You have an amazing sister. Thirty-four. My sister? She is a real talent. Forty! Yes, and I'd like her to work for me. Forty-one. Quarant'uno. And I think she really will be on magazine covers. What a scam! Girls will never believe me! It's too early to party. He took my portfolio! Do you get it? Mateo, the guru! I've never heard anyone pile on the crap like that before: "I blew a lot of cash at Monte Carlo." Did you see his face when you upped the bid? Like the principal when he saw his note on the wall. I was starting to worry what I'd do if I won the auction. What wouldn't I do for my sister? Don't flip out about that. It was the best solution. I guess. D'you know what? I feel like dancing. No problem. Or maybe I'd rather take a bath. - OK, I'll drive you home. - I meant your swimming-pool. - Are you sure? - Sure, go to your place. Get out. Laura, get out! We were supposed to go to your place, dummy. - Get out! - What's with you? I just lost the bet. Talk clearly, you're encrypting again. The bet was about you. Turbo said you'd only go after the money, I didn't believe it. But now I know. He was right. Do you really think that? Someone was here. - No. - You're bluffing! I saw Kossa. What's up? - Hey, what's wrong? - You were right. I lost the bet. I'll give you one more day, just help me with this gangster. Please... Do you want to permanently delete the file 'Laura'? What happened, boy? You look like shit. Nothing, Mr. Toshek, I just wanted to drop by. I understand. That means your girl dumped you. I thought she was different, but it turns out, she's just a... Remember, appearances are misleading. For example... Let's take me. Everyone thinks I'm that actor- Mr. Linda. But I'm only Tosiek. And that, boy, is my tragedy. That's why I drink. That's as good a reason as any. I, on the other hand, would like to look like Linda. That is, like you. You see... I tried to be macho... Like him, but I can't say "fuck this" and "fuck that" all the time. Because I am a gentler, a kind of a more romantic fellow. What, and no women? Nothing. When they found out I wasn't him, that was it. Fucking asshole! I started drinking because of him. When he's in a new movie, I can't even show my face in town. You shouldn't worry about some movie. Some movie? The bastard's in every fucking one! Turn off the cameras and all security will pounce on us. Then feed some skanky porn onto their monitors. Here... plug this into the video signal line. I'm feeding yesterday's footage. And we have our live transmission. What shit are you getting us into again? Loosen up, man. I have an idea how we can get Kossa off our backs. And for good I don't even want to look at this. Fuck! He really did swipe the Pampers. That's weird. Zenek's shift was yesterday. Who gives a shit? You're not the one paying his overtime. You haven't paid for the Pampers. I'm so sorry. I was hurrying back to my kids. And your change? Congratulations on picking on Laura. - At least buy me a brew for that. - What for? Remember those strippers I sent you? That wasn't a present from Laura? Do you think it's her style? One beer, please. Tell me, why did you leave her? It wasn't me. She broke off our agreement. What agreement? To pretend to be a couple in front of everyone. - But why? - So she'd have some peace of mind, and be left alone by the horny dicks chasing after her. - OK, but what was in it for you? - What did I get? An official girlfriend whom I could introduce to my friends or my grandma. You mean, you didn't... Laura? Me and Laura? She isn't my type. So who's your type? Pamela Anderson? Naomi Campbell? Leonardo DiCaprio. Double vodka, please! Actually, I was in love with Michael J. Fox before that. Well, I'd prefer Michael J. Fox. Well, then make it two double vodkas. Marcin... I'll tell you something in confidence: Laura has a weakness for you. Like she fell in love with you. She's been dragging on that you did something for her no other guy did. But you know what? Fuck those dumb broads. Guys like us should stick together, don't you think? - You know what, Daniel? - What? See ya... Come on. I did all of this for you... Hi, it's Laura. Please leave a message after the beep... Laura? I love you! It's all my fault. You did a fine job. It went real' smooth, like shit out of a duck's ass. - Here's some for jellybeans. - I want the file, not the money. How come? Things went so well and now you want to screw everything up? I did what you asked for, and now I want out. I'm the one who says it's over. Then have a look at this video. You have 3 hours to call me back and hand over the file. Come on, you'll be late for your plane. Damn! They must have a weak spot somewhere. Think... think... think! Wait, what did he say? "If you can't get in through the front, try getting in from behind." Of course... they outflanked the defenses! My Laura! I wanted you to know. I was way out of line. Come here, come on. - I can't, Marcin. I can't. - Please... I can't. Not now. I'm going to Milan... to be in Mateo's shows. Did you come here just to tell me that? Remember our last conversation? I want to tell you how very wrong you are. Give me a chance. - My taxi's waiting. - Don't leave. So long, Marcin. To the airport, quick! Of course. Call, Kosa. Come on. Call! Call... - Marcin! - Laura? Hello there, friend of my friend. As someone once said, "friends of my friends are my friends, and enemies of my enemies are my enemies." No, it doesn't make sense. Anyway, in the spirit of that saying, I decided to make friends with your girlfriend. And all of this because of our buddy, who didn't act like a true pal. So be a good dog and get the videotape from him, 'cause otherwise our friendship will be up shit creek. Marcin! Let her go! I'm the one who has the tape. - Merchandise for merchandise? - Alright. Just don't hurt her. So you're authorizing me to make a friendly visit. Inspector Buja, please come to me at the palace as fast as you can. Please, I'm begging you, Sir... - Where's that damn tape with Kosa on? - What for? - He's coming here. He kidnapped Laura. - Fuck. It's on the video shelf. It's not - I searched there. The cops will be here in a sec. Kosa has Laura, and I'm sick of this shit! Turn on the web-cams. Feed the views to my H.Q. Over the net, get it? If I see it I might remember faster. Well, where is it? It's on the shelf by the door. See? At the very bottom between Matrix and Back to the Future Part III. It says 'Pampers' on the label. - This one? - Just be sure to make a copy. - Do you see Inspector Buja? - Yes, I see him. At last, Inspector. It's good that you came. I don't understand why you waited so long. You could've caught Kosa directly during the heist. Sit on my lap, Brutus. Look, Sir. I told you I'm not interested in Kosa. Oh, speaking of the devil... So many friends in one place? Are you fucking mad, Kossa? Puppies at this age don't shit into Pampers. These ain't no Pampers, but two big ones. To all Internet surfers! Make police come to the Palace! One of us in danger! And what's she doing here? Are you in love? Not me, him. Then are you his best man, or her pimp? I'm sure not your nigger anymore. Not good, Kosa. You can't even handle a couple of brats. You tell me that? I've been busting my ass for you for 4 years. I'd rather be in the slammer. This is my last payment. And that's it. Give me the cassette. - I'm the one to decide when it's over. - Yeah? OK, OK. Here's your videotape. A little class, you fuck! Let's go! Brutus. Turbo, watch out! Turbo! Sorry I'm late... Don't say anything. - It's all my fault. - It's OK. Don't speak. You won the bet. Run for it! Run for it. Where did you learn that? Don't know. I must've seen it in some movie. - Laura, I love you. - Why does he want to kill you? Tell me, what did I do that no other guy did for you? - Daniel spilled the beans... - Tell me. You picked flowers for me. Forget-me-nots. - Promise me one thing. - Anything. That you won't wear those stupid clothes anymore. I prefer you now. I'll promise, as long as you'll wear tennis shoes. OK. And you look nice with glasses, too. Gentlemen, everything's under control. What's going on? Let me go, you idiot! I'm an officer. What're you doing? That's an order! I'm an officer of the Central Bureau of Investigation! Now we're post-Buja. Your transmission on the net beat the ratings for Big Brother. You'll pay for this! Wait a moment. I'll have a few more questions. Then we'll take you home. Marcin, I'm begging you, stop it! What do you want to do now? I want to make an honest million dollars... Shit, I must be dreaming. May the Force be with you!
