(The Mid-1970s Kunchon) Don't let the boat break down, or fights break out, or anyone get hurt. Just let us get a big haul. - Flatfish? - Flatfish! Pull it up! Hey, Jin-gu! Help her with that. - I'll do it! Let me! - Over there, quick! Hook it there! All right! Wow, a flatfish! You idiot! What's your problem? If you'd hooked it on right, I wouldn't have lost it. Are you laughing? It's gone. Just come up! Let's move! (Ferocious Dragon) (SMUGGLERS) Look, these are all rotten. What a waste. It's useless. They're all dead. What do we do with these? - We won't earn anything. - How much are these worth? Goddamn factories, someone should burn them down! Then why don't you do it? Stop wasting your time. Let's just go get drunk. I open my eyes one morning and feel strange It's half past eleven Ah, I'm so tired Near where they built that chemical factory, the sea is covered with dead fish, bellies facing up. And they didn't even get a fine. As for us, we're just driving empty trucks back and forth to Seoul. Can't even pay for the fuel. So instead, why don't you do that thing I told you about? - What thing? - The thing. Diving for crates that were thrown in the sea. A lot of our customers get rich in that line of work. Pull them up without knowing what they are? What does that matter? Necessity knows no law. Don't do what our government says not to do. What? How did that Japanese radio enter the country? And that jar of Vaseline next to it? Don't we need to earn a living? Earn a living... How far must a man go to earn a living? Throw them over, quick! One, two... We're with Kunchon Customs Office. We're inspecting imported goods. Anything not declared is contraband. Even a grain of coffee! (Import Declaration) All done! Listen up everyone! This will be a piece of cake. Crates instead of abalone! Is the sea always this rough? How much will you make off this? We do all the work, and the cash all goes up your butt? I've got hemorrhoids, I can't do that. Mugwort is good for hemorrhoids. We're here. Get ready, everyone. Let's do it! They're coming! Here they come! Wow, they're here! Choon-ja, are the boxes all there? - Lift it up! - I got it, Dad! They're coming up! Hey Hammer, careful with those! Go easy, don't break anything. - Lift it! - Hurry it up! Be careful with those! Don't break anything. Quickly! I'll take it. Let go. Jin-gu, how many boxes? 16! - 16? - Yes! There are 4 left! Keep it up! Here. Good work, Toughie. Everyone on board? No more boxes below. Exactly 20 boxes! Let's move! (Hong Kong/Taiwan/Japan) (Kunchon Port) (Namdaemun Market) (Smuggled Goods Enter the Living Room) What stories does it carry? People coming People going A stirring in every heart Oh boat, you leave dreams behind at the wharf You know the sadness of the crying seagull Tell me Tell me Oh boat, departing from Yeonan Wharf (Ferocious Dragon Shipping) Soon we'll be drowning in cash. Don't talk nonsense. Bro, have you thought about that job I mentioned? It's obviously a terrible idea. Let's not raise the stakes. Taking on too much can get yourself killed. If you're finished, then go! Bro! Bro! You should consider my position too! Jeez. (Jongro Tea Room) - Hi Choon-ja. - Where's Uncle? He came early. Boon... Gold? Gold bars? Do you know how frustrated I must be to call you two here? I've begged your father for months, but he keeps saying no. My Seoul backers will stop buying anything from Kunchon if we refuse one more time. And I'm stuck in the middle... Jeez. Still, we need Dad's permission to go through with it. Let's be honest. I'm the one who gave the people of Kunchon a new lease on life. I feel so unappreciated. If we take this on, what's our share? Is gold smuggling a joke to you? You know Dad's temper, how will you deal with him? Such a country girl. If no one goes blabbing, no one will know. For now, don't say anything to Dad. You don't trust me? You need to get rich and follow me to Seoul. Hands off me! From what I've heard, the profits for gold are huge. Gold? What gold? - What? - What gold? That gold. Want a gold brick in your head? What now? Don't interfere in our work, okay? Nothing's been decided yet, so just keep quiet and don't talk to anyone. - Yes. - Hey! Yes? If you suck at your job, at least know when to shut up! When you moved here you said you wanted to be a sailor. Then jump on an ocean liner and go far out to sea! Don't waste time on things you can't do! - Don't intimidate the kid. - Why should I stop? You're such a spaz! I saw you take those foreign cigarettes! - Foreign cigarettes? - I didn't take them, I... Stop mumbling, will you? Look, go buy yourself some clothes instead. - There's no need, please. - Just take it! - I can't accept this! - You embarrass us! Hey Choon-ja, wait up! Why be so protective of him? You've got your own brother. At least Jin-gu's got a dad. That poor kid's alone. You're too soft on him, that's why he's so screwed up. Stop adopting greasy-haired kids off the street. - What about you? - My hair's clean, it's okay. - What? - Dad... I've never cared what others think, but ever since I started this work, I haven't had a good night's sleep. Even if I struggle, I'll make my living fishing. Uncle has already arranged the next shipment. If you pull out now, he'll be in trouble. Why did he tell you and not me? He didn't tell me, I heard him tell Jin-sook. He wanted to buy us noodles, so he took us to the city today. I'll take care of it. For now, no more smuggling. What's gotten into the old man? He's been anxious all this time, saying he wants to quit. But what do we do about this shipment? Need to call Uncle quickly and work things out. But if they throw crates in the sea, your dad won't just leave them. I don't think we should do this. Do we have to go this far? You've got a dad with a boat. Cleaning houses from age 14, I've learned being poor is a sin. If you're poor, you're guilty even when you're innocent. I'll talk to Uncle. Don't mention the gold to your dad. And toughen up, will you? Hey! I'll tell Father this is the last time! They're coming up! Why are they so heavy? Are they filled with gold nuggets? Lower the rope! Is it attached? - Okay, raise it up! - Raise it! That's all of the boxes! Hey, throw us a rope! - The cable? - No, a rope! Hurry! - Over here! - Why's the cover off? - Lift it! - Lift it! It's caught! Pull it harder! - More? - Right. - Lift it higher? - Hey, that's too much. Damn! What is that? Isn't that gold? What the hell did you two do? You idiot! - Choon-ja! - Just come back! Don't move, this is the customs office. Stop all movements! Get Jin-sook and Choon-ja up here! I don't see them! Wait! Tell them to leave it! Get on board, quick! Don't move, and follow our orders. Throw everything over! Sis! - Jin-gu, raise the anchor! - Okay! Hurry! Jin-sook, these ones first! Stop that. Don't throw away evidence. Down, down! Hey, the anchor! Dad, the anchor's caught! We should cut the rope! No, just pull it! Do it together! Grab on! Pull! Pull! Pull it! Jin-gu! - Jin-gu! - Jin-gu! Dad! Ferocious Dragon! Stop your engine! No, Jin-gu! - Dad! Dad! - How could this happen? Come on, quick! Oh no! Jin-sook, don't! You'll hurt yourself! No! - Dad! - You can't! What about Jin-gu? No! No! You'll die too! How are you? Your face is so gaunt! Is everyone okay? After serving 6 months, our lives are all a mess. Don't know if Choon-ja's dead or alive... But the rumor is she reported us to customs. How else could those clueless customs agents show up right then? Choon-ja's alive. She was seen at the bus terminal, and people say she was at customs. The rumor has it she got a reward for reporting us. Taking the reward and running off to Seoul... Right... Ever since she showed up in town she's rubbed me the wrong way. We helped her get on her feet, and this is how she repays us? Everyone knows you and the Captain treated her like family. Ungrateful wench... What's with your face? About the Captain and Jin-gu... I took care of them. I got them a memorial stone. Thanks. You need anything? If you want food to trade in there... Find out about that wench Choon-ja. (2 Years Later) (Myeongdong, Seoul) What took you so long? - Boss! - Yeah? She's here. Okay! Don't make such a mess! - It's here! - Wow, it's here! Take a look! She really bought this all overseas! Look here. You can't buy this even in Japan. Want to touch? In Italy, women wear this in winter over nothing but their underwear! Wait, don't show them that! I even refused the Patti Kim show! You're going to sell it anyway, why not show them? But you know how much this thing costs. I heard you, Miss Cho. How can you say that? You make it sound like we can't afford nice clothes. I didn't mean that. If you're just going to look... Oh no, not that mink! I'll really be in trouble! Then you shouldn't have brought them! Why are you making my customers lose face? Miss Cho, whose is that? Did they pre-pay? It's for Chairman Chung's wife, and of course it's not pre-paid. So Chairman Chung's wife is your only VIP customer? I'm feeling so left out here! Whatever, you explain it to Chairman Chung's wife, then. Boss! It's the cops! The cops! - Hey, break everything! - Choon-ja, run! Take off your coats! Pretend you're sewing! Hey! How many times did I tell you to keep off our turf? We've got experienced veterans here working their asses off, and you come steal our customers. How is that ethical? I'm on a different level than you! And how can you tie me up? This is absurd! Let's just carve some lines on her face, and mess up her wrists so she can't do business, okay? I fitted a business suit for the son of the Police Chief! Either cut my throat or untie me right now! Hey, come here! Sergeant Kwon is here. He says not to touch her. Dammit. Oh, hell no. Know who I am? Even newly arrived spies recognize you, Sarge... Mr. Kwon. And you've heard what happens to people who meet me in person? They die, become crippled... or join your team? In addition to stealing these guys' customers, you've been going around not paying for the goods you sell. Adding it all up, it'll take $18,000 to settle matters. Come on, honey, $18,000? I don't like being interrupted. And... you're too old to call me honey. Pay me $18,000 in collateral and you can go, otherwise, I'll cut off your hands and feet so you don't cause more trouble. Understood? The No.1 smuggler of Korea is going to this trouble for a minnow like me? No collateral, I see. Mr. Kwon, please! It's not fair to demand this all of a sudden from someone like me! Mr. Kwon, I'm not sure what you've heard about me, but please let me tell you myself! I put my dignity on the line every day! You're a businessman, don't act so crude! Mr. Kwon, we're traders, not gangsters, right? Dammit! I've got the collateral! A lot of people try saving this, and end up losing this. You're blocked at Busan Port! You're squeezing minnows like me because your goods can't circulate! Everyone knows there's a crackdown on smuggling there! They pay rewards to people who report smuggling, so you keep getting stabbed in the back! - Want me to shut her up? - No. Keep talking. I know a way through. In Vietnam, whenever I'd catch a communist, I didn't know their language, but I always knew if they were lying. The US soldiers were all amazed, so they used me often. There's a place where ships can unload without getting caught. Oh, yeah? There's such a place? Kunchon. Kunchon? I worked as a diver pulling smuggled goods out of the sea. All clear. - Go ahead. - Stop right there. Didn't I tell you not to take dirty money? Jeez. What a circus. - How many layers is that? - Chief! If you fall in the sea, you're a goner. - Su-bok! - Yes? How's the house call going? Think we need to operate. Hey! - That's it! - It's coming out! Quiet down! It's out. There's nothing here, you're just wasting time. We'll go home when we're done. You replaced the cover here. We closed it because of the rats. The rats... It's rotten... close it! Hey, hurry up! It's hooked. - Pull it up! - Pull it up! Easy! Slowly! There are people down here! Dok-sun! Dammit, are the goods okay? If it falls, you should catch it! You jerk! Someone's hurt down here! Even if you break a golden calf, people come first, you pricks! Fine, but clear that stuff away before someone sees it. Are you okay? Don't leave footprints! Why's the coffee so dark? Use less coffee! Don't nod off, girl! Do this right! No footprints! Young people these days... Welcome! Wait, who is this? My god, you're alive? Wow, how many years has it been? Choon-ja, how have you been? New Jongro? You bought the tea room. Madame Ko, you made it big! To think of what I went through to buy this place... All those women whose husbands I seduced? All of them trying to pull my hair out. Look at this, look! The bald patches! Your hair's always been a bit thin. My hair gets frizzy, that's all. It's not thin! Anyway... what brings you down here? How do you know whether I came down or up? You've got a definite Seoul vibe. You can't fool a tea room madame like me. Anyway, did you come down knowing the vicious rumors about you? I've got ears, too. Are people still pulling goods from the sea? Wow, no foreplay with you. I landed a pretty good deal in Seoul, but given those rumors, I can't trust just anyone. You were the first person I thought of, Boon. In that case, will any crumbs be left for me? This is Choon-ja you're talking to. Who took over from Jin-sook's dad? This is it? How'd you figure this? We're even pulling them to land. Nothing we can do. At least pay us as much as we work. No use talking to us, we're just the messengers. And my medical fees? The goods were damaged. Want us to pay medical fees, and charge you for the damage? Hey! Hey! Dammit. What's all the commotion here? What did I tell you? To treat these ladies properly. - Didn't I, you idiots? - I'm sorry. Want a kick? Sis, wait up! I told you to talk to me if the guys treat you badly. Yeah. Hold up. Just a second. I'll talk to my guys. Don't be angry. Here. Go have some BBQ, okay? Look at your face, it's so gaunt! Did you learn anything from my father? If you want to be generous, do it for everyone. What are you staring at? Go in! (Kunchon Hotel Nightclub) You're looking fab. You're no longer a country boy. Bringing up the past again... I hear you're the boss in Kunchon now. You really made it big while I was gone. What are you doing showing up after 3 years? Nobody here wants to see you. Have a drink and beat it. Heard of Sergeant Kwon? After the Vietnam War he started smuggling in Busan and now he's the king. He wants to set up a water route through Kunchon. What if we open it for him and he swallows us up? He's Korea's godfather of smuggling, why would he bother with a snot-sized town like Kunchon? Listen to you. What are you saying? That we live in a place this big? Then why should a small-minded snot like me trust you? Who asked you to? You don't have to trust Kwon either. But if things go well, this'll be bigger than Busan. I'll call you. Since it's been so long, go enjoy yourself. Keep your money. Got any foreign cigarettes to slip to me? Boss! A call from Kunchon! I talked to the Kunchon boss. The kid who used to crawl before me now runs things. What are his conditions? For goods that go through Kunchon Port, 20%. 50% for distribution through the West Sea. Of course ships that come in can add whatever goods they want. You're saying he won't work with us? In return, no need to pay off the customs people here. Got any other options besides Kunchon? How about coming down and checking it out yourself? Let's start for Kunchon. Oh, my favorite customs officer! I've missed you, where have you been? Why didn't you visit me? Why do you like me so much? - Look at me! - All right. - Did you miss me? - Sure. - You did? - Why the hurry? Please say it out loud. - Honey. - Yeah? - Look at me. - Okay, okay. You leave me crap-stained boxers to wash and you want a discount? Should we take them back? Just stop getting on our nerves, and leave it. Leave it all here. We give those beggars some work, and they throw a hissy fit. What did you say? - What? - Jin-sook! - Forget it, just go! - Come on. Oh my god I can't believe it! That wench Choon-ja is back in Kunchon. Why's she here out of the blue? I saw her just now meeting with Hammer! Why are those two meeting? What is it this time? Why'd you all come? You can't come in, really. Damn women! Hey, Choon-ja! Hey! What kind of reunion is this? Was it really you? Don't you know me? Is that the first thing you say to someone who went to jail without even knowing where you were? Then why not ask how I've been? You're looking fine. New hair color. (Map of Kunchon Port Radios) Up until now I've put up with your crap, but if this job involves her putting one foot in Kunchon, you're dead. Nobody works for them without my permission, got it? Without those women, this is dead on arrival. You'll have to patch things up first. Jin-sook's gotten a lot tougher. Wherever it is that I shall stay I won't feel lonely It's just that the day I must leave has come early... I mean, I thought this was the countryside, but there's a movie theater, a club, everything. When the night market was at its peak, we sold nothing to Seoul because we used it all here. Not anymore. Because we don't have someone like you. Details on tomorrow's ship, and photos of the port surroundings. Just glance over them before tomorrow's meeting. But is it just the two of you? We still haven't decided whether to go ahead here. No need to drag everyone down here. Like some hick. Everyone here is a country hick, so they probably expect a lot from you. In Vietnam, just the two of us went around killing communist. A town like this should already be grateful to have him. That explains it! The war made you who you are. Did he lose his eye there, too? If it weren't for me, he'd be blind. This is why people sing your praises. But you know, When you meet Mr. Jang tomorrow, there's one thing you can do to help me out. Help you out? As we talk, it'll become clear what I mean. When you feel like it's time to take my side, help me out a bit. Miss Choon-ja. We may be sitting face to face, But the connection here is not this, it's this, understand? Of course. Still, this is flat, and this is deep. A deep connection. It's not like we need to share a bed to have a deep connection. Can I believe? Believe in your heart? It won't just be a passing cloud? Can I believe? Believe in your eyes? It won't just be the sun behind the clouds? Those words "I love you" sound so tender... Dammit! - Let's eat! It's ready. - Okay! Have a seat! - Sergeant Kwon! - Yeah. Hurry and sit! Let me pour you one! He's a city boy, he's not used to this. Here. - And one for Choon-ja! - Okay. - Cheers! - Cheers. That's nice. Have a bite! This is raw croaker. And this is the best part. Heard of an air bladder? Great for stamina. Have a bite. Oh no, right on his... - What the hell? - Oh no. How could it land right there? Oh my, so sorry. How could this happen? Didn't know you two were so close. Mr. Jang! We're here to discuss business, have some tact! Well, he could think that. Hey, we're here. Stop the boat. Kill the engine! This is where inbound ships can throw off smuggled goods. The fishing's been no good here since the factories were built, so fishing boats go further out. When the women divers pull up crates, there'll be nobody around. And the water's clear here, so easy to find them! But Mr. Jang, have you solved that issue? - What issue? - The divers! What about the divers? Why throw crates if there's no one to pull them up? Huh? The divers refuse to work with you! They turned against you! Wait, the divers won't work? No, no... Actually 3 years ago, Choon-ja here... No! Not 3 years, just a few days ago Jin-sook and the others came and said they refuse to work with you! That's what I'm talking about now! That's just what I'm saying! Never mind the little details, just say if there's a problem with the divers. There is a problem, - but not mine... - What is with you? Mr. Kwon came all the way here and is very open about his plans, Why aren't you being open? I am being open! You've been sucking them dry for so long, they don't trust you! I can't believe this nonsense. Believe or not, we need to solve it! Things are a mess before even starting! You guys looking to start a brawl? No, no! Sit down, guys. I said sit down! He said sit down, idiots! Don't do this in front of a guest! I didn't realize it before, but the divers and Mr. Jang are on really bad terms. Come again? Without the divers, it's dead on arrival! Those are your words! - Am I right or wrong? - I'm gonna go crazy. Mr. Kwon, please listen to me. The problem with the divers... - The problem... - But... needs to be completely solved before I ship any goods. Exactly! If you leave that problem to me, I can solve it. If you match whatever terms I agree to with them. What kind of scam is this? Look here! I need this problem solved before starting anything. Please listen to me! If Choon-ja can solve it, I think you should meet her conditions. Dammit... Can I believe? Believe in your heart? (July 1977 Itinerary) It won't just be a passing cloud? Can I believe? Believe in your eyes? It won't just be the sun behind the clouds? Those words "I love you"... What? Not that, the intestine there. Wait a minute! Don't throw it out. Give me that. It's for Toughie, to make soup for her kids. - She'll feed this to her kids? - Yeah. She's coming. Come on, let's go. It's too dark to see anyway. Let's go. God I'm sick of this. Jin-sook, I know how you feel. But you know my situation? My husband lost his arm last year, and it's hard to feed my kids. I won't work for Hammer. But let me go out diving for Captain Kim. Stop crying! I don't want to talk to you, just go. Do you really believe all the rumors about me? Rumors? You're the only one who ran away. If not you, who tipped off customs? You know before I came to Kunchon, I roamed around cleaning houses? When I was 17, a guy at one of those houses tried to rape me. Before I knew it, I stabbed him with a kitchen knife and ran off. If they'd caught me on that boat 3 years ago, I'd be finished. Is this the speech you've been rehearsing for 3 years? If you knew I was on the run for stabbing a man, would you even talk to a wench like me? Did you even visit Dad or Jin-gu's grave? Hammer ended up with your father's boat! Shouldn't you get it back? How long will you live like this? - Work with me instead! - Damn you! I really want to cut you open right now, but I don't want to end up like you. I still smell my father and Jin-gu's blood. What did I ever do to you? Stop harassing me and get lost. Don't make me go to jail for killing a wench like you! I'll be at Boon's tea room! Where is she? Toughie! How could this happen? Oh no, Toughie! Why'd you have to go out so far? Toughie! How did it happen? A shark bit her! However desperate you were, why dive in a place with sharks? Did you call an ambulance? Ambulance! Toughie! On my back! On my back! Oh no, Toughie... (Kunchon Medical Clinic) Even if they operate, she'll still spend her life with one leg. The leg's not the problem, it's the money. Surgery is expensive. She's 2 months behind on tuition. First her husband's arm, now her leg... The sea is so cruel. As long as we get this job, I'll talk to Mr. Kwon about getting Toughie's medical fees up front. I won't work on the terms Hammer gave us. Of course not! I'll get paid according to which goods come in. I'll open the crates and check. I guarantee you'll earn much more than last time. We'll start only after we get the hospital fees, not before. And... Whenever you, Hammer and Mr. Kwon meet, I'm going too. I won't get screwed over again. You laugh? Don't think for a second I trust you. Oh my. The one in white pants was at Jongro Tea Room? Yes. I smelled something fishy. That's Choon-ja, the one who escaped in the water 3 years ago. Then my nose was correct? But don't sniff the dog bowl when soup's on the stove. See the guy with the eye patch? Yes. What smuggler goes around with a guy in an eye patch? After coming back from Vietnam, Sergeant Kwon has landed in our laps! There's nothing here. Bring them over here. - Don't break anything. - So much stuff here. Be careful. It's not easy to break this many regulations. - Su-bok. - Yes? Is Prosecutor Ko in his office? - Yes. - Honey, please don't do this. Why all of a sudden? All of a sudden? You know I do this job. And why'd you break the law? What do people like me know about law? People bring us things, and we pay for it, that's all. Buying smuggled goods is tax evasion. You know how serious a crime that is? I didn't know they were smuggled, I just thought they were imported to Seoul. Fine, then. Okay, okay! If you let it slide this once, I'll do whatever you tell me. Choon-ja's been hanging out here? What? Su-bok saw her several times. You... worked so hard to buy this tea room, what a shame it would be to go to jail and lose it all? It's just something I overheard... On the 7th, maybe? The divers will bring up goods off Turtle Island. The 7th, Turtle Island? What time? (Dawn, August 7th) But if they'll dive for the goods at 12 p.m., why are we coming 2 hours early? Need to be ready in case things change. They're heading out to dive. Our people are coming to pick up the goods, right? (Start Time of Operation 12 Noon) - Chief, they're here! - They are? Stand by! Okay, ready. Let's go. Nobody move! This is the customs office. Don't touch those goods! Hands in the air! Hands up! They seem to be on to us. (4 Days Before Operation) The customs officer who was hitting on Madame Ko has been following me around. Yesterday when we met with Sergeant Kwon, that officer was in front watching us with his section chief. Those jerks from customs, if they target merchants who work with divers, word will get out, and they think we'll stop. So you're the one they're going to squeeze. When it happens, just drop the info I tell you. It's just something I overheard... On the 7th, maybe? The divers will bring up goods off Turtle Island. The 7th, Turtle Island? What time? Around lunch? Midday... Was it 12 p.m.? They'll be trying to catch us, but we'll show up 3 hours early to pick up the goods. (9 a.m., August 7th) (10 a.m.) But if they'll dive for the goods at 12 p.m., why are we coming 2 hours early? Need to be ready in advance in case things change. So we trick customs, that's it? We'll have to tell Mr. Kwon or Hammer. Only the three of us will know. (Savings Account Cho Choon-ja) This is everything I own. You'll have my lifeline in your hands, so there's no way I can trick you. About 50 meters away from the main point, I'll drop one item separately. Jang's crew won't know about it. It's something I've already paid for. So I won't share it with the Kunchon crew. I left it off the deal memo. One bag will be tied with the exact same scarf. Stow it away separately, and bring it to me directly, okay? One, two... Hey, hurry up! How many left? The last one's coming soon! Lower it. Hey, this is the last one. - You got all of them? - Yes. Then let's move! Don't touch the goods! Hands up! Everyone hands up! 3, 4. There's nothing? (Great Success) Open the other one! Empty out all the nets! Not that net, find another one! (The Day Before) The 7th? 12 p.m., Turtle Island. Okay? There's nothing here. Stop looking, it's empty. (Ferocious Dragon) Two televisions! Coming your way. Pay us before taking it! Give me the rest. Why'd we change the time this morning? It was supposed to be at noon. I don't know. Choon-ja just changed her mind. Dammit. Wow, you're much more clever than I thought. Next time I need something, help me out. Mr. Kwon. Am I part of the family now? We'll meet again someday We'll part, then meet again The boat whistle is moving farther away... That's the spirit! To our continued success! Let's have a drink. I'll pour for you. This is for my father. This is for Jin-gu. And this is for me, sitting like an idiot as you all get wasted. Sis, where are you going? Don't be that way. She's so self-centered. Never mind her, I'll take care of it. Let's drink! She's never been a people person. Were you ever in the military? The scariest thing on the battlefield is when your gun is pointed at yourself. In this business you need to keep your team happy. Betrayal is the worst. Oh hell. Can't believe I'm hearing that word coming out of your mouth. Suddenly breaking your appointment on a job isn't something we can just ignore. Right, Sergeant Kwon? Crossing your legs in front of me? Dammit. And take your hand out of your pocket. It wasn't in my pocket. We need to plan bigger next time, so don't let your guys go on a spending spree and draw attention. Keep an eye on them. Don't disgrace yourself. Won't you shower? How much do you know about Hammer? How much? You know who the guy in this photo is? This is... You think the reason customs swooped in is because you were involved? Hammer is a rat. When you changed the time and got him so worked up, was it because you knew something? Mr. Kwon... Are you suspecting me? There's no point in suspecting you. Instead, there's going to be a change of plans. Don't disappoint me, and just follow along with your divers. What about Hammer? He'll be dead before the next ship comes. Who does he think he is, treating me like a pushover? Hey. That Kwon jerk just lines things up, and we do all the work, right? He's pocketing way more than we get, and that creep treats us like his servants. Hey, how about cutting out Kwon and taking it ourselves? I'm sure Sergeant Kwon's got some power behind him. And I don't? Can't you beat Sergeant Kwon? He doesn't look that strong. Hey, I could whip his ass all night with one hand tied behind my back. Do I really have to explain this to you? Go roast us more squid! Jerk. - Out of the way! - She ate them all herself. Listen up. Go to the neighboring towns, and round up all the best fighters you know. Yun-young and so on. Dammit! I can't take this anymore! - Su-bok. - Yes? Why don't you put those files away and go? Yes. (Smuggling Reports) What important info do you have? You know that Choon-ja is back in Kunchon? Of course, because of her I got humiliated. Seems you're dipping your toes in the same water. You shouldn't, at least for the sake of your father's memory. Chief. Was it really Choon-ja who ratted on us 3 years ago? How many times should I say it? It's illegal for me to tell you that. And what difference does it make now? Another big job is happening soon. Are you informing or turning yourself in? The owners of that gold are out for my blood now! Customs... Who the hell informed them? Hey, how did you escape? Are you suspecting me? I barely escaped with my life! Who knew about that gold coming in? I didn't tell Jin-sook's dad. So you, me, Jin-sook... Hammer. Hammer? That was the last time I ever saw Uncle. He called me saying he'd meet Hammer one last time. You little prick! How can you do this? Let me go, jerk! Let me go! Why tell me this now? Would you have believed me without this photo? It's true he stabbed me in the back, but you remember what he was like 3 years ago. He practically held his breath in front of me. That's my point. He held his breath in front of you, so what made him change so much? Look who he's with. You never heard customs report anything about gold, right? But even the gold we dropped in the sea disappeared. Someone able to trick customs, and take the goods for himself... Who do you think? - You here? Come in quick. - Honey! - Did anyone see you? - Not a soul. Look... ta-da! That's expensive. It was really hard to get my hands on this. How can I drink on duty? - Behave yourself! - How can I? Oh, baby! I love you so much! - Honey, what's that outside? - What? Look, quick! - Is someone coming? - What? Hold on. Is there a fire or something? No, no! Nothing's on fire. I don't see smoke, so... (Smuggling Reports) It's right here. Hammer's real name is Jang Man-seok. (Smuggling Report Informant: Jang Man-seok) He and Chief Lee hatched a plan and carried it out together, this proves it! According to the customs officers, last year Chief Lee bought a house in Seoul under his wife's name. This isn't news to be taken while sober. I'm sure we've got some whiskey left! I apologize. Sure. I'm the first one to be suspected. But how could you suspect me? When you heard I ran away, you thought it was me? Weren't you curious to know if I was alive or dead? Honestly, don't you know me? I'm sorry. Jin-sook, why do you think I came back here? I met Chief Lee. Why? To snitch on me? For god's sake, Jin-sook?? Hey. Hey! Don't just think of yourself. What about me? Starting from now, we're going to take down those jerks Hammer and Chief Lee. That's your only goal. Boon! Ta-da! First, we must keep driving a wedge between Mr. Kwon and Hammer. I'll take care of Mr. Kwon, Boon, keep pulling in Chief Lee by giving clues about the job. Jin-sook, you stick to Hammer and keep dropping hints that Kwon and I have other plans. If we coordinate and make them all suspect each other, we can't lose this game. No one must know what we learned today, so maintain the right distance as you watch over them. If we get too worked up, it'll fall apart. But if not, we'll win. The ship with the stuff I mentioned already left Hong Kong. Tomorrow at midnight they'll throw the stuff here. Plus my men are on the way from Seoul and Busan. I'll get rid of Hammer's gang before the ship arrives. But Mr. Kwon, there's a problem. Sharks pass through this area, so we can't dive. Not long ago, one of the divers got attacked here. As long as you don't go in yourself, right? Chief... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Has an ignorant wench like you heard about theft of public documents? Did Choon-ja order you? Want to spend the rest of your life in jail? You could've lived a quiet life doing adultery, why do this? Call everyone who's involved. Get that one-eye! Open up, jerk! Kwon you coward, hiding there like a girl! Kwon, you prick! You scared? Finish him off already! Hey, what are you doing? Leave! You prick! Hey! Kill him! Let go! Where are you going! Get back here! You jerk... With my heart draped in silk, I stand in your path I will greet you with a pretty candle As I walk a flower-strewn path, I become a butterfly I fly up and land on your heart Crap! A single word becomes a song or a poem With my heart draped in silk Get him! I sing a song for you Do you understand how I feel? Please tread lightly on my heart draped in silk Do you understand how I feel? Kill him! With my heart draped in silk, I stand in your path I will greet you with a pretty candle As I walk a flower-strewn path, I become a butterfly I fly up and land on your heart. A single word becomes a song or a poem Damn you, Choon-ja... Wait, wait! - Wait for what, you wench? - $300,000... $300,000 of diamonds are coming in. Follow me, wench. ...on my heart draped in silk Do you understand how I feel? Chief, this is so unfair. I had no choice, because of Hammer's threats! Did you make her do it? Chief, wait. Where's Choon-ja? - We need to stop Choon-ja. - What? Hammer found out there are diamonds on this shipment. He says he'll kill everyone. Diamonds? He says he'll kill Mr. Kwon, Choon-ja and you, and keep it for himself. How do you know that? He said if I help him out this time, he'll give me back my father's boat. He asked me to make sure the divers don't talk. He says with $300,000 we can all start over. $300,000? He's rounded up all the West Sea gangsters and gone after Mr. Kwon. Mr. Kwon might be dead already. And I didn't know what he meant, but he said he'd take care of the hold you have over him. This is customs chief Lee Jang-choon. Is Prosecutor Ko in? - Hey! - Yes? Gather up the ladies over there. Okay, that's enough. Stop, he won't die. Come over here. Hurry up! Listen, will you? Send away the others. After all, I can get the diamonds myself. There's more than diamonds. We need to get the rest, too. We can't dive there because of the sharks! - Don't talk back! - You jerk! You goddamned...! Hey, stand by for now. Gather around. - Hello. - Customs! Good of you to come out. Putting in overtime? Wait here. You're surrounded! For the murder of Kwon Pil-sam and Choi Gap-sik in Kunchon Hotel, Jang Man-seok and company are under arrest. - Come out peacefully! - Who cleaned up? Huh? Why look at me? The one who invited us should clean up! I was busy dragging out these wenches. If I'm in charge, shouldn't I go out first? Do we look like we were playing? We all got knives stuck in us! Even still, how could you... Who was the last one out? Huh? Who? First, let's fight! Don't let them in! Stop them! Stop them! You can't run from this! You jerks! Stay away! Let go! You know who I am, you punk? - Let go of me! - Cuff them! No, not us! We're just hostages! Don't move! - Let go! - Stop hitting me! Let me go! Just wrap this up and go, why all the fuss? Let go! Don't try to do it inside. Hey, cuff him! - Let go, jerk! - You come here. Can you move that cultivator? Move that cultivator! - It isn't fair, they invited... - Shut up, will you? You want to die? Hurry up! You got a call from the prosecutor? Yes. I need to question these guys about something, I'll send them back when I'm done. It's a Rolex... Let's go! Thanks! Give me the safe's combination. What happened to her? Tell me now! What's with you, Bro? Bro? Damn you! You ungrateful lout, hurry and tell me the combination! (The Night Before) Hammer told me he set the combination to my birthday. Guys will do anything to try and get a woman in bed. What's this? It's really here? Huh? Hey! How did that get in there? Honey, I deserve to die! But I had no choice! Chief said he'd send me to jail, and I was so scared, I told him! Told him what? That you ordered it. You made her steal those documents! Not you too, Bro! If you call me Bro one more time in front of these people, I'm going to rip you to shreds. Why didn't you tell me about the diamonds? Hey, it's over now. Just tell him everything! What's gotten into those wenches today? Shut your mouth, will you? There must've been a good reason for you to kill someone. I heard about the diamonds today. Right before taking out Kwon I called you, Bro... Chief, but you weren't in. Choon-ja, you know it all. Just tell him! Bro! Dammit... I get it... those wenches found out about us, so they're turning us against each other! I warned you not to call me Bro again! The crates are already in the water. You're sure about the diamonds? It's all true. $300,000 worth. But the place Sergeant Kwon chose is too dangerous, we can't dive. And where is that? Where the shark attacked Toughie. Damned smugglers, scared of sharks... All of us here are going out on that boat, got it? - Su-bok. - Yes? Come here. - Listen. - Yes? You stick around and then come with me, okay? We can't let them humiliate us, so don't report this, and after we get the goods, we'll sort it out then, okay? - Yes. - That's good. You kept a shotgun from the last shipment. Where is it? Dammit. You guys know how to use these? We went diving last month, you were there. You know why I brought these? Seeing as I gave you a respectable life, you should repay me. So we're at your workplace. Get to work! Wow, a light squeeze and it practically fires itself. Choon-ja! - Uncuff them. - What? Or will you dive in and watch over them? I see. Everybody get up! Come over here. You guys held up well. Go over there. Nice work. Su-bok, you wait here. Everyone come in here. You guys go in after the divers, and after they get the goods, finish them off in the water. You know how much $300,000 is? It's enough to buy 50 large houses in Seoul. Go back now, and you'll end up in jail. Instead, clean up here and buy yourselves homes. Don't just sit there, put these on and go in! - Get moving! - Where are you going? Do your job. Hurry the hell up. Oh no! Madame Ko, time to get some sweat on your brow. Guys sweat hard to earn money, then your swishing skirt sweeps it away. Isn't that like tax evasion? Come on, do some work. Grab his ankles! Lift! 1, 2... Not much time, so leave the cheap stuff and get the diamonds. And don't let the women come out alive. Damn it. Why do they keep coming up? Oh hell. You're really going to kill the women? I can't aim with you freaking out! I missed again because of you. Will you kill me, too? Go make me some coffee. Die, you evil prick! You wench! - They came up! - Over there! Choon-ja! Jin-sook! Hurry up! To the boat, quick! The bag? Forget the bag. There's a shark here! It's only us here! Hurry! - Shark! There's a shark! - Hurry! Jin-sook, Choon-ja! - Go up quick! - You first! - It's gone. - Can you believe this? What's wrong with her? She grabbed Chief Lee and fell in the water, like Nongae. Stubborn girl, she can't even swim. You jerk! You've got the diamonds, let's wrap this up. Wrap this up, are you crazy? I almost got eaten by a shark because of you! Back in the water. Go in, now! There's a shark in there! I'm ordering you, wench! - Jerk! - Dammit. Why's this stupid anchor always acting up! Oh damn! Sis, I'm sorry! I was wrong! You know me! This was all Chief Lee's doing. He's a mean jerk! You're a good person! You wouldn't do this! Just shut the hell up, for god's sake! You earned a living because of me! Shouldn't we all help each other? Sis! Choon-ja, look at me! How can you do this to me? Aren't you going to drive? Where are you going? Come back! Help! Save me! Captain Eom! Let's move! You rotten jerks! I'm going to kill you! Dammit, give me a break. Oh waves, do not be sad Diamonds! Oh waves, dance for me In your endless struggle Oh waves, do not be sad Rise up sun through the darkness Sing of a splendid solitude Shine Oh stars, even in the darkest night Brighten the eternal silence Oh wind may you blow Oh waves, rise higher (Kim Hye Soo) (Yum Jung Ah) (Park Jeong Min) (Ko Minsi) (Kim Jong Soo) (Kim Jae-hwa Park Gyeong Hye) (Park Junmuyn Joo Bo-bi) (An Seho Lee Jeongsoo) (Kim Choong Gil Shin Minjae Kwak Jinsuk) (Jeong Do-won Kim Won-hae) (and Zo In-sung) (Kwon Pil-sam) (Admitted 1977.08.17) In your endless struggle Oh waves, do not be sad Rise up sun through the darkness Sing of a splendid solitude Shine oh stars, even in the darkest night (Written and directed by Ryoo Seung-wan)
