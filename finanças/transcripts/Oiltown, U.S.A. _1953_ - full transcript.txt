HE HAS THE HAIRS OF OUR HEAD NUMBERED. HE SEES THE SPARROW FALL. HE'S INTERESTED IN YOU-- YOUR PROBLEMS, YOUR DIFFICULTIES. THE THINGS THAT INTEREST YOU ALSO INTEREST OUR HEAVENLY FATHER.

I WANT YOU TO SEE IN THIS PASSAGE OF SCRIPTURE THREE THINGS THAT I BELIEVE ARE APPLICABLE TO US TODAY. THE FIRST THING I WANT YOU TO SEE IS THAT CHRIST FORGIVES AND FORGETS OUR PAST. YOU SAY, WHAT DO YOU MEAN OUR PAST? LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DID YOU KNOW THAT THE BIBLE SAYS THAT EVERY ONE OF US ARE SINNERS? THE BIBLE SAYS YOU'RE A SINNER, I'M A SINNER. THE BIBLE SAYS WE WERE BORN IN SIN. WE'RE SINNERS BY NATURE AND INHERITANCE. WE'RE SINNERS BY CHOICE. AND WE'RE ALSO SINNERS BY PRACTICE. EVERY ONE OF US HAS BEEN INFECTED WITH THE DREADED DISEASE OF SIN. AND GOD SAYS THE RESULT OF OUR SIN IS DEATH, DESTRUCTION, SEPARATION FROM GOD, AND HELL. NOW, HOW DO WE BECOME SINNERS? WE BECOME SINNERS NOT ONLY BY BIRTH, BUT ALSO BY BREAKING THE MORAL LAW OF GOD. NOW YOU'RE GUILTY OF BREAKING GOD'S MORAL LAW. THE MORAL LAW OF GOD WAS SUMMED UP IN THE TEN COMMANDMENTS AS GIVEN TO MOSES ON MOUNT SINAI. ONE OF THE COMMANDMENTS, FOR EXAMPLE, SAYS, "THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE ME." NOW ANYTHING THAT COMES BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR GOD IS ANOTHER GOD. ANYTHING THAT YOU LOVE MORE THAN YOU DO GOD, THE BIBLE, PRAYER, AND CHURCH AND SPIRITUAL THINGS IS YOUR GOD. IT MAY BE MONEY. IT MAY BE SOCIAL PRESTIGE. IT MAY BE PLEASURE. THE BIBLE SAYS IT IS IDOLATRY! AND GOD HATES IDOLATRY MORE THAN ANY OTHER SIN, AND MANY OF YOU ARE GUILTY OF THE SIN OF IDOLATRY. AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER COMMANDMENT THAT SAYS, "THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD THY GOD IN VAIN." THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF YOU THAT ARE GUILTY OF PROFANITY. GOD HATES THAT SIN! BUT THERE ARE OTHERS OF YOU THAT MAY NOT BE ACTUALLY PROFANE AS THE WORLD CALLS PROFANITY, BUT YOU'VE TAKEN THE NAME OF GOD IN VAIN. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU PRAY A PRAYER IN JESUS' NAME AND DO NOT MEAN IT FROM A SINCERE HEART, THEN GOD SAYS YOU'RE GUILTY OF THE SIN OF TAKING HIS NAME IN VAIN. THEN THERE'S ANOTHER COMMANDMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT SAYS, "THOU SHALT NOT KILL." YOU SAY, WELL, BILLY, I'VE NEVER BROKEN THAT ONE. AH, YES, THERE IS A WAY TO KILL, THERE IS A WAY TO MURDER, MORE THAN STABBING IN THE BACK AND SHOOTING WITH A GUN. YOU CAN KILL YOUR WIFE BY NEGLECT. YOU CAN KILL YOUR WIFE BY UNFAITHFULNESS. YOU CAN KILL YOUR MOTHER AND FATHER BY THE WAYWARD AND WICKED LIVES THAT YOU'VE BEEN LIVING. AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER COMMANDMENT THAT SAYS, "THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT IMMORALITY." YOU CAN COMMIT IMMORALITY BY A THOUGHT, BY A LOOK, OR BY AN ACT. THOUSANDS OF YOU ARE GUILTY OF COMMITTING IMMORALITY. GOD CALLS IT SIN! I COULD GO ON DOWN THE LINE. BUT THAT'S ENOUGH TO LET YOU KNOW THAT EVERY ONE OF US HAS BROKEN THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. NOW SUPPOSE YOU'D ONLY BROKEN ONE COMMANDMENT. THEN THE BIBLE SAYS YOU'RE GUILTY OF ALL! "HE THAT OFFENDETH IN ONE POINT," SAYS JAMES, "IS GUILTY OF ALL." NOW THAT MEANS THAT YOU ARE A SINNER. EVERY ONE OF US STANDS BEFORE A BROKEN LAW. WE STAND UNDER THE CONDEMNATION OF GOD. GOD IS A RIGHTEOUS GOD. GOD IS A HOLY GOD. GOD'S EYES ARE TOO PURE TO LOOK UPON INIQUITY. THEREFORE, GOD SAYS THAT EVERY ONE OF US ARE CONDEMNED! WE ARE LOST. WE ARE SEPARATED FROM GOD. WE ARE BOUND FOR DESTRUCTION. WE ARE BOUND FOR A PLACE THAT JESUS CALLED HELL! NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT IS YOUR POSITION RIGHT NOW AS A SINNER! YOU SAY, BUT BILLY, WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT MY SINS? I AM GUILTY! I'M GUILTY OF ALL KINDS OF SINS, WHAT CAN I DO? WHICH WAY CAN I TURN? SHALL I REFORM? SHALL I TURN OVER A NEW LEAF? NO, THERE'S NOTHING THAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT, HUMANLY SPEAKING. THE BIBLE SAYS, "FOR BY GRACE ARE YE SAVED, THROUGH FAITH, "AND THAT NOT OF YOURSELVES. "IT IS THE GIFT OF GOD, NOT OF WORKS, "LEST ANY MAN SHOULD BOAST." YOU CANNOT SAVE YOURSELF. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH GOODNESS THAT YOU COULD DO TO SAVE YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU'RE GUILTY OF BREAKING THE LAW OF GOD. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING THAT CAN BE DONE, AND THAT IS TO TRUST JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR. NOW WHEN JESUS CHRIST DIED ON THE CROSS, HE DIDN'T DIE BY ACCIDENT. HE DIED BY DESIGN. IT WAS PLANNED BY GOD FOR YOUR REDEMPTION AND YOUR SALVATION. WHEN JESUS CHRIST WAS HANGING ON THE CROSS, I WANT YOU TO SEE HIM. I WANT YOU TO SEE THE NAILS IN HIS HANDS. I WANT YOU TO SEE THE SPIKE THROUGH HIS FEET. I WANT YOU TO SEE THE CROWN OF THORNS UPON HIS BROW. I WANT YOU TO HEAR HIM AS HE SAYS, "MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME?" BECAUSE IN THAT MOMENT, WE CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE AWFUL SUFFERING THAT JESUS WENT THROUGH FOR OUR SINS. BECAUSE IN THAT MOMENT, GOD TURNED HIS BACK ON HIS ONLY SON. JESUS WAS SEPARATED FROM THE FATHER. AND IN THAT MOMENT, JESUS ENDURED THE PANGS OF HELL AND DESTRUCTION AND JUDGMENT. AND BY HIS STRIPES, WE ARE HEALED! IT IS THROUGH THAT DEATH THAT WE CAN FIND FORGIVENESS OF SIN. JESUS TOOK YOUR PLACE AS A SUBSTITUTE. NOW GOD SAYS, REPENT OF YOUR PAST SINS! BELIEVE IN HIM, TRUST IN HIM, COMMIT YOUR LIFE, SURRENDER YOUR SOUL TO HIM, AND THOU SHALL BE SAVED. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF YOU EVER GETTING TO HEAVEN UNLESS YOU COME THROUGH JESUS CHRIST. THERE IS NO SALVATION FOR YOUR ETERNAL SOUL EXCEPT YOU BE CONVERTED AND COME TO CHRIST AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR. THEN THERE'S A SECOND THING IN THIS PASSAGE I WANT YOU TO SEE-- CHRIST PROVIDES COMPANIONSHIP FOR THE PRESENT. THERE ARE MANY OF YOU THAT HAVE PROBLEMS, AND BEWILDERMENTS AND PERPLEXITIES. THERE ARE MANY OF YOU THAT HAVEN'T BEEN HAPPY IN YEARS. DOWN INSIDE, IT'S FULL OF TURMOIL AND STRIFE AND DISAPPOINTMENT. I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT JESUS CAN SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS. HE CAN LIFT YOUR BURDENS. HE CAN WIPE THOSE TEARS AWAY. HE CAN GIVE YOU INWARD PEACE AND JOY AND HAPPINESS THAT YOU NEVER DREAMED EXISTED. DO YOU REALLY WANT TO LIVE? DO YOU REALLY WANT TO START LIFE WITH A CAPITAL "L"? THEN COME TO CHRIST. LIFE DOESN'T BEGIN AT FORTY. LIFE BEGINS WHEN YOU FIND CHRIST. AND THEN THE THIRD THING IN THIS PASSAGE OF SCRIPTURE, THE BIBLE SAYS THAT CHRIST GIVES ASSURANCE AND HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. NOW THE BIBLE SAYS IT'S APPOINTED TO MAN ONCE TO DIE. EVERY ONE OF US IS GOING TO DIE. YOU'RE GOING TO DIE. DO YOU KNOW CHRIST? HAS HE GIVEN YOU ASSURANCE AND HOPE THAT THE MOMENT YOU DIE YOU GO INTO THE PRESENCE OF CHRIST? THE BIBLE SAYS: "TO BE ABSENT FROM THE BODY "IS TO BE PRESENT WITH THE LORD." AND GOD WARNS, "PREPARE TO MEET THY GOD." GOD WARNS TIME AFTER TIME, "SET THINE HOUSE IN ORDER "FOR THAT SHALT DIE AND NOT LIVE." ONE OF THESE DAYS, YOU'RE GOING TO BE TAKEN TO THE GRAVEYARD, BUT YOUR SOUL WILL HAVE GONE INTO ETERNITY-- HEAVEN OR HELL. AND YOUR WAY TO HEAVEN IS ONLY THROUGH A KNOWLEDGE OF JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR. YOU SAY, WELL, BILLY, I WANT ALL OF THAT. I WANT MY PAST FORGIVEN. I WANT CHRIST TO HELP ME IN MY PRESENT STATE OF CONFUSION. AND I ALSO WANT HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. WHAT CAN I DO? WHICH WAY CAN I TURN? ALL RIGHT, RIGHT NOW, TURN FROM YOUR SINS, AND TURN TO CHRIST. REPENT OF YOUR SINS. CONFESS THAT YOU'RE A SINNER. YOU CAN DO IT RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE, RIGHT NOW! AT THIS MOMENT. YOU SAY, HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE? JUST A MOMENT, THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE. AND IF YOU WILL, I WANT TO PRAY FOR YOU. I WANT YOU TO BOW YOUR HEAD, RIGHT NOW, AND LET ME LEAD YOU IN A WORD OF PRAYER, WILL YOU? THAT'S RIGHT, GO AHEAD, BOW YOUR HEAD. AND I'M GOING TO PRAY FOR YOU. OUR FATHER AND OUR GOD, WE PRAY IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST, THAT THAT PERSON WHO IS BEWILDERED, CONFUSED AND CONVICTED OF HIS SIN, MIGHT TURN FROM SIN TO RIGHTEOUSNESS, FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT, FROM DEATH TO LIFE, AS THEY LET CHRIST COME INTO THEIR HEARTS. WE PRAY THAT THERE MIGHT BE MANY THIS NIGHT THAT WILL BE BORN AGAIN AS THEY ACCEPT CHRIST AS LORD AND SAVIOR AND MASTER. FOR WE ASK IT IN HIS NAME. AMEN. [organ music plays] [telephone rings] YES?
