RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Welcome to shopping from home channel. Hi, Terrie. Hey, Kate. How's it going? Great. This is Terrie Carpenter, everybody. Hi! Are you guys gonna come visit me on set? We're kicking off the holiday segment with "Santa's Claus-et". We'll be there. - Yeah. Great. Bye! - Talk to you later. -Terrie, hi. - Hi! Hi, I'm Hillary, the new production assistant. Nice to meet you, Hillary. First day jitters? - Yeah. - It's okay. I can remember my first day. I started out as a P.A., too. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah. It was 10 years ago. I was a total nervous wreck. Well, then you know how I feel. Although I'm having a hard time believing that you could ever be a wreck. Oh, no... You're Terrie Carpenter. You're, like, amazing. Thank you! I know this isn't very professional, but I watched all your segments, you're my favorite host. Really? Well! Thank you. Then you're my favorite P.A. Just don't tell the others, okay? I'm actually hoping to one day become a host. Really? Well, I would be happy to show you the ropes. - Really? - Absolutely. - Thank you. - Yeah. Okay, well, I'll leave you to get your hair done. - Okay. - I'll see you later. - Hey, Terrie! - Hey. - How are you doing today? - Good, how are you doing? Great! ...on in five, four, three, two... You know, they say patience is the secret to catching fish, but I'm telling you, this fishing rod is the secret. It's strong and it's durable. It has the backbone necessary for the big fish, but the sensitivity to detect the tiniest nibble. David and I just went fishing with these rods last weekend. Yeah. Just us, some brews, and the sun on our backs as we grilled a fresh catch. This fishing rod gives you a day to remember. But, gentlemen, maybe you're saying, "I really shouldn't buy that". Well, remember there are no "shoulds". Don't vacuum your way through life. As I always like to say... What is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life? I know, right? "Don't vacuum your way through life"? What does that even mean? And his audience is "gentleman"? What? Because, what, women would never want to buy a fishing rod? Not to mention he's stealing his catchphrase from a Mary Oliver poem. Well, not to add fuel to your fire, but word behind the scene is that David asked Sharyn if he could swap for your "total gym fit" segment. What? That's a top-selling item. I... It's okay. I'll talk to Sharyn. Okay. You're good to go. Great. Thank you. - You're on in 10. - Okay. And you and Noah are still having dinner with me and Jordan tonight? Yes, absolutely. We can't wait. - Okay. - Thanks. Hey, Frank. Hey. Terrie, looking beautiful. Thank you, David. You must want something. And smart as ever. I was hoping you'd switch with me, your "total gym fit" segment for my "tufted storage bench" slot. You know, that way, it's more geared towards our demos. Right. Right. Are you implying that my predominantly female demo doesn't want gym equipment? Or that women might not want a fishing rod? I mean... What? I mean, is it so wrong to say that there might be differences between men and women? Oh, really? Like what? Like, when a woman asks that question, it's a trap. Terrie? Yeah? You are almost on. Thanks, Hillary. Have you met David Crabtree? Hey. And, Frank, if you ever need to find David, he will be here eating all of the buttered popcorn jellybeans out of the candy dish. Well, it's not my fault we have the same favorite candy. But you know what? Don't you mind Terrie. She's just trying her hardest not to succumb to my charms. What I'm trying to do is keep my scheduled segments. I know you already talked to Sharyn about the Gymfit. Yes, I did, but that's only because I know what's right for our demos. They like what I pick. David here is very humble. The humblest. Also, there is an all-hands-on-deck staff meeting at noon. Maybe Sharyn's announcing her retirement. Oh, no. Sharyn's not retiring. She built this company, she is this company. I'm sure you know, but Sharyn St. Clair is the top-selling host and she's pretty much the big boss around here. I know Sharyn. I've watched her segments my whole life. That's why I wanted to work here. Really? Me too. See? I knew you were my favorite P.A. Savannah, how are you feeling? My back hurts. - My feet hurt. - Yeah. I'm going to request a segment on massage chairs. - Please. - I'm sorry. I already booked that segment for Frank and I, but maybe we could trade. Let's get to set. Today, we kick off "Santa's Claus-et" by celebrating everything Christmas, presented by Balsam Hill. Beautifully realistic Christmas trees inspired by nature, with exclusive "true needle foliage" that replicates nature's design. And with over 50 unique tree species in their collection, there's a tree for everyone. And the setup is so quick and easy. Nothing says "Christmas" like that perfect tree. Thank you, everyone, for being here. Now, I know there are rumors floating about my retirement, so I want to put those rumors to rest... Because it's true. - Now, don't panic. - What? Oh, no, it'll be okay. I'll still come visit. Look, you guys, I've been here 30 years. You're like a family. You couldn't get rid of me if you tried. But, shh! Don't tell... I am getting older, and I got grandbabies and I want to spend some time with them. I got other things I want to do. So, along with the board, I'll be starting the search for the host who will replace me, in my prime-time slot, my "monthly pick", and as the captain of the ship. Sharyn, I'm so sad you're leaving. Sharyn, you can't leave. You are this company. If you have a second to talk, I would... Terrie, if you're about to pitch yourself to me as my replacement, just save it for set, because... You're already in the running! You know I love you on air and off. David... You too. Now, I got to go to this little press conference, for my song and dance, but we'll talk some more, soon. Knock 'em dead, Sharyn. Thanks, Sharyn. I hope it won't be too awkward for you when I replace Sharyn as your boss. You really are here just to annoy me, aren't you? Yeah. And for the donuts. You... This is my dream. Right? This is my exact childhood dream. I used to walk by the SHC studios on my way to school every day and just imagine that I'd work there. No! I did! This is my chance. I've been working at SHC for, what, like, 10 years now? Yeah. I don't think anyone knows or loves the company as much as I do. Well, then I'm sure you're the one that's gonna get the promotion. You think so? I know so. Anyway. Were you able to reschedule your Boston trip so you could come to the SHC "meet the hosts"? It really means a lot. I know, I know, I know, but I tried, and they said there was nothing they could do. I'm really sorry. - Hi! - Hi. - Noah. - Hi, you guys. Yeah, we actually have some big news... Yeah. Really? - We're engaged. - What? Wait! When did this happen? What happened? Tell me everything. It was so romantic. When Jordan brought Goldie over for our morning walk, there was a ring tied to the collar. It was so cute. - Nice. - Wait, wait. Hold on. You've been engaged for an entire day and you didn't tell me? Now, to be fair, I made Emmy promise not to tell anybody, especially you two, until we got here in person, so that's kind of my fault. Okay, okay. Congratulations. Now, on to pressing news, when are you gonna pop the question? No pressure. You two are such a great couple. Come on. What are you guys doing? You look like bugs. I'm helping uncle David refinish his canoe. I thought we agreed to the rule no power tools? You know, rules are meant to be broken. Rules, yes. Bones, no. And you're supposed to be doing your homework. This is for... shop class. And we did my science homework. Uncle David taught me the world was made out of protons, neutrons, and mo... Next time, I'm hiring you both a sitter. Come on, we've got to get home. Start dinner. Later, bud! You seem to be in particularly good spirits today. I found out there might be a big promotion heading my way. - Congratulations. - Thanks. See ya, uncle David. I can't believe they're getting married. I know! They're a great couple, they really are, they're great together... It's just that they've only been together for... What, a year? I mean, we've been together for... Like, almost two years. Do you think... Should we maybe be thinking about getting married? I mean, we like the same things, and we want the same things, you know? I mean, look, I know marriage is... It's a big step, but it is the next step. It is, that's true, you're right. But... I just don't... I don't think I'm there yet. Okay. Yeah. Do you want to watch something? I should... I should probably rewatch some of today's segments. Well, with the promotion coming up, I want to be extra on top of everything. Yeah, but then you're gonna fall asleep and then I'm gonna end up watching SHC by myself for an hour. Crazy idea, you could choose to, you know, change the channel. You know I can't do that. Once I start something, I gotta finish it. I promise, I won't fall asleep. This isn't just a fishing rod... This is the life you dream of, dangling on the end of a hook. Maybe your day-to-day has gone rote. Maybe it feels like a chore. Or maybe there's just something missing. Whatever it is, don't settle. I've asked you before, but I'll ask you again. What is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life? I have to go. Hey. I have been calling you all morning. Well, my phone was on silent. Sharyn bumped your segment up an hour. You need to be here A.S.A.P. Shoot. Okay, I'm coming. You're needed in hair and makeup immediately. Great. A little non-fat milk, no sugar? You're so sweet. Thank you. No problem. Also, here's your new product for your segment. What happened to my "total gym fit" segment? There's been a reshuffling. David. It's a reversible umbrella. You close it inwards, so the rain doesn't fall on you. And it has a tracking device that syncs to your phone so you won't lose it or forget your umbrella. Really? But maybe you don't want to open that inside? It's bad luck. It's okay. I'm not superstitious. Okay. You're good to go. - Okay. Great. Thank you. - No worries. Terrie, they need you on set. These stationary bikes give you a great cardiovascular workout, but only leave a small footprint in your home, all for an affordable price. Frank, how you doing back there, buddy? I can hear you puffing. I'm doing good, David. I love this bike. It's a family fitness machine. - Terrie... - Is everything okay? It's Savannah. She's fine. The baby's fine, but her blood pressure spiked again last night and she's been put on bed rest until delivery. - I'm glad she's okay. - Yeah. I'll... I'll go visit her after work. Okay. Who's gonna host with me? That's what we're trying to figure out now, because you're on next. Do you know what, I can just do it myself. No, no, no. You need an assist. Co-hosts always do better. Yeah, but I'm on right now. I mean, who else is there? I could do it. That's really nice. I just, I don't know that that fits the segment. Why? Men need umbrellas. No, no. This... this is a good idea. David's already prepped, and we need two hosts on the stage right now, so... Let's do it! Hey, don't open that indoors. Bad luck. Well, it seems my luck has already taken a turn for the worse. Besides, worm's bad luck is bird's good fortune. Terrie, do you know how to hook up your phone for the tracking demo? Yeah, you just plug it in, right? Yes. Then we're on in 10... Okay, so I know you're not prepared, but just follow my lead. We'll start with the specs and then... Okay, I'm gonna stop you there. 'Cause I'm bored. And what a way to sell some umbrellas. Three, two, one... We're on. I'm Terrie Carpenter. And I'm David Crabtree. And we're here to bring you the cutting edge in umbrella technology. Terrie said it... The cutting edge! This is a reversible umbrella! Because how many times have you stayed clear from the rain only to get soaked when you open your umbrella? That's the worst! I can think of worse things. Can you? But wait! There's more! This umbrella has a tracking device that syncs to your phone so you never have to lose or forget it somewhere again. Because let's be honest, we're all constantly losing our umbrellas, and then we have to replace them. But this simple tracking device solves that problem. Let's show our viewers how the app works. Let's! So I have the app here, and I'm just gonna go ahead and plug this into our phone. Need a hand over there, Terrie? Do you want me to take over? Well, I was just reminded why you always need a great umbrella. 'Cause you never know when you're gonna get caught in a storm. Ha! How could you break up with me by text? I know. I'm sorry, but... Not to mention how close you came to breaking up with me on-air. You weren't answering your calls and I got into this tailspin. I wish I could take it all back. Yeah, I wish you could, too. I need you for the "meet the hosts" promo. Yeah, just give me a sec. - Okay. - Thanks. How are you doing? Well, I'm still trying to get over the 15 seconds of dead air. It was 10 seconds, tops. Yes, but I still broke the cardinal rule... No dead air. It'll be okay. And when I asked you how you were doing, I meant about Noah. I just, I thought we had a future together. I thought we were gonna get married and build a life. Maybe we were settling. But what's so wrong with that? You don't have to do the "meet the hosts" promo if you don't want to. I want to go. I love my fans. I'm sure they want to meet the host that froze on live air. And with everything that happened, I really need the good exposure right now, especially if I'm vying for Sharyn status. Very good. Excellent! Excellent. Wait, do you think what just happened takes me out of the running? No. No! Of course not. But Sharyn did ask to meet you at the cafe once you're done here. I'm not getting fired, am I? Okay, Terrie? You're up. - Hi! - Hi. You're just gonna be over there by the chair, please. - Okay, great. - Thank you. Wonderful. Okay, here we go. All right. How are you doing? Great. How are you? Good. Yeah. Cookie? No, thank you. Sorry to hear about the break-up. Thanks. I guess maybe you shouldn't have opened up that umbrella inside, huh? Too soon? Yeah. Well, as always, it's been a pleasure, but I have to go. Me too. Where are you going? I have a meeting with Sharyn. I have a meeting with Sharyn. Then I guess we have a meeting with Sharyn. Well, thank you two for meeting me here. Terrie, I heard about Noah's texts. You did? I know this is a hard time for you. I'll be okay. Well, of course! You'll be better than okay! Even with all that dead air, you handled it so well, I salute you. We all know there'd have been far more theatrics if that had've been me. Or me. Now, I want to talk to you about the segment you just co-hosted. I've been looking over your numbers and, I saw something amazing... Almost double viewership! You know, before the hiccup. That's great! Yes, it is. We all know that you both have your own key demos... But I also know that you both want to be considered as my replacement... And to do that, you need to broaden your viewership. Terrie, Savannah's gonna be gone for about six months and you're gonna need a new co-host. You want me to host with David? For about three weeks, until the "monthly pick", where we will announce to our viewers who's replacing me. Yes! Gotta take this. Excuse me. No. We can't do this. Why not? Because I can't work with you and your whole gimmick. "I'm not just a man... I'm also a salesman". I like to think of that gimmick as my personality. And you're not exactly baring your soul to your audiences either. Don't think I'm so keen to be partnering up with you and your gimmick. Oh, I have a "gimmick"? "I'm Terrie and I'm perfect. And for 10 easy payments of $9.99, you too can be perfect, too!" Well, David, I look forward to seeing you try. See? This is good! We are good. We've got good banter. Even if we do, can you take it seriously? Good news. I don't have to. Because you're gonna take it seriously enough for the both of us. All right, you know what? I'm gonna agree to this, but only because, "what would Sharyn do?" Sharyn would co-host with anyone, no matter the challenge. Even you. I'm getting a good vibe here. Okay, so... What do you say? We'd love to. Couldn't be happier. Start with the Ponzu Sauce, get in there... Add chipotle rub... Then we sear it on the stove and then pop it on the grill. Hello? Hey! We're in the kitchen. Nice, buddy. - Hey, guys. - Hi. Hey. Uncle David is teaching me how to make the perfect steak. Yeah! Frank and the guys are coming over. We're gonna watch the game and argue around the grill. Can I stay at uncle David's tonight? No, honey. We got to get home. Sorry, bud. But I promise you that when you get older, we'll spend a lot of time arguing around grills. Uncle of the year, right here. Hey, you guys are coming to the "meet the hosts" event, right? Wouldn't miss it. Come on, Guy. - Bye, uncle David. - Hey, guys. - Hi! - How's it going? Good. What's up, man? Hi, David. My name is Ryan Costa and I have a proposal I want to discuss with you, if you could give me a call back. Okay... Cajun-seaweed or wasabi-vinegar? What are these? It's a new product we're gonna be selling. David loves them and sold Sharyn on the idea. Well, if David loves them, then maybe eating these will give you some insight into him. Overbearing and unpalatable. That's David. I actually like them. Yeah, well, you actually like David. And I think you could as well. I just need to get through these next three weeks. I mean, I'm this close to my dream and now I have this giant boulder named David Crabtree placed in my way. Don't forget, it's his dream, too. And... And how are you feeling about Noah? I mean, I'm... I'm hurt. You know, and disappointed. And with everyone at work knowing... I'm... A little embarrassed. Enough about that! Let's talk about your wedding. Come meet the hosts... Including me... This Saturday, at our studio complex. There will be fun, food, fans, live demos, and segments. See you there. That good? Great. We just got assigned the item for our segment... This oven. Great. Let's grab a coffee and go over the product specifications. Is that how you prepare for segments? By educating myself on the product? Generally. Yes, why? How do you prepare? See, I like to observe the shopper in their natural habitat. Okay, but how is this preparing us, exactly? We should be reading the manufacturer's instructions. You mean the manufacturer's opinion? Okay, look, David, I know that everything is a joke to you. No, you just think everything's a joke to me. And that replacing Sharyn seems like a fun next step, but I've been working my entire life for this. It's my dream, and after what happened with the dead air and everything, I really need this, so I need you to take it seriously, okay? Okay. "Serious". An escape room. What? You know that SHC is actually in the works with this company to sell an "escape room" party kit? Yeah, I know, I want that segment. Well, then we should go in and do it. We should be preparing for our segment. Yeah, yeah. This is preparing. We are familiarizing ourselves with a future client while learning to problem-solve and work together. Come on, just do this for me, and then we'll do your thing. Okay, by "my thing", you mean actually being prepared? Sure. Okay, fine. - Oh, yeah! - Fine. This is really cool. You've done one of these before? Yeah, but never an Egyptian pyramid. So the idea is just to get out, right? I was just trying. They make it harder than that. You have to go through a bunch of puzzles first. Whatcha got? It's a riddle. "What has a head and a tail, but no legs?" A snake? Yeah, could be a snake. Like this? Oh, David. No legs. Yes. Heads, tails, a coin... I was gonna say that. Looks like a code. Bowl... Beetle. Bowl. Beetle. Are you sure you've never done one of these before? Wait? There's another room? Yeah. Ladies first. This isn't the exit? How long is this gonna take? Loosen up a little bit. Enjoy yourself. Don't worry. No one's watching. What? What is that supposed to mean? It must get tiring being so focused on appearances. Excuse me? It just seems that you want everything in your life to look like it's perfect. Well, maybe things are pretty perfect. What about Noah? Okay, things weren't perfect with Noah, but they were good. How does a good relationship end in a text message? I mean, all I'm saying is that maybe what you really liked was the idea of Noah. The perfect relationship, you know? Well, as always, thank you for your unsolicited opinion. I will take it with a grain of prehistoric sand. You're calling me a caveman? Bet you this opens. Hold this? I don't think brute strength is gonna help you here. Look, the same symbol is here on your scroll. I think it's a door with a foot... So that's... "Enter"... And exit. And the same symbol is here, with four circles. Four circles! Hey. So, here's a dog, and a ring. So, "d" and "r". So that's "door", it has to be "door". How are you doing this? So we just need two "o" s. Obelisk! And... Osiris. Osiris, Egyptian god. Have you ever been on a gameshow? Not much of an escape room. Oh, David... Every room I'm in with you is an escape room. How did you do that? The trick is to figure out what's stopping you, and work backwards. It's pretty simple. You ready? Seeing as we didn't rehearse? No. The best segments are off the cuff. No, the best segments are the ones where the hosts are prepared, where we can actually educate the viewer on the product. The viewers don't want to be educated, they want to be excited. Words tell, but emotions sell. Okay. It's convection, yes... But wait, there's more, it's also a toaster, roaster, air-fryer. Look at that crispy bacon. - It's hot. - That is hot. Maybe you live in a small space or maybe you just need a second oven. But, Terrie, my favorite part here is the speed. All right, you know, if I come home from a long day of work, I have my sister and nephew over, I just want to cook a quick meal. You cook? Imagine that. See, and a quicker cook time means less time spent over the stove and more time with my loved ones, and isn't that what it's all about? I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that you cook. Well, you'll have to come by some time. What about you, Terrie, do you cook? No, actually, I'm kind of a mess in the kitchen. Really? So the great Terrie Carpenter isn't perfect? Far from it, David. Let's go ahead and take a caller. Cheese! Hi, Terrie. - Hi! - I'm Al. Hi, Al. Nice to meet you. My wife couldn't be here, but she's a big fan and asked if we could have a photo together. Yeah, of course. Will you, sign one of those for me? Of course. Who should I make it out to? "Suzan" with a "z". Just wanted to say how happy I am you're hosting with David. He's great! He has me buying things I never thought I'd want, but I love. And I'm loving you paired with Terrie. She's my favorite. Really? Of course! She's honest and bright, and always speaks her mind, and she makes me want to do the same. She's inspiring. I know it's a bit silly, but when I see David on the air, it's like having a friend over to visit. Uncle David, you're famous! No... Well, maybe a little. It's just nice to see you so happy. To see you loving your job, loving your life. I remember when that wasn't the case. Terrie... Emmy, this is my sister, Linda, and my nephew, Eric. Hey! I know you. You're famous, too. No! No. But I do like to pretend I am sometimes. You're not pretending. And I think it's cool that all these people came to see you guys, to connect with you. Well, when you put it like that, it is really cool. And a little terrifying. What do you mean? Nothing. No, I think it's terrifying, too, sometimes. I mean, it's a lot of pressure to try to be the person your fans think you are or want you to be. Yeah. Well, uncle David and Terrie, you need to hit the stage, so how about we go check out the cotton candy machine, then hit the stage, and watch the segment after? Okay, are you ready for our spot? I am about to be. You're gonna read the brochure? Well, you asked me to be prepared. I meant more than a minute before we go on stage. You should've specified. But you did the escape room, so I figured, you know what, this is the least I could do. You're becoming a real team player. Terrie? - Could I get a photo? - Of course! Want me to take it? Why don't you get in? - Okay? - Yeah. - Thank you. - You're welcome! Your fans really love you. So do yours. Really? I mean, in spite of my whole "gimmick"? Well, I think they actually believe that that gimmick is part of your personality. But I suspect that you're a little deeper than you let on. Terrie Carpenter... Did you just pay me a compliment? Maybe. A little compliment. Who are you? Ladies and gentlemen... The man who needs no introduction, who, every time you see him on TV feels like a friend come to visit... David Crabtree. All right, David! And a very big round of applause for the ever-inspiring Terrie Carpenter. All right, folks, today, we have something truly special. It is an exclusive offer available only for our meets the hosts guests here today. What's better than the perfect gift? The perfect gift you can share with others... I'm talkin' a trip. We have a one-week, all-inclusive vacation to Maui. Yes, David! Well, it sounds to me like David has finally figured out what he wants to do with his "one wild and precious life". I have, and it is retire in Maui, but first, vacation in Maui. Terrie, have you ever been to Maui? Actually, I have! I went once with, a friend. It was gorgeous. It was, really, the most romantic place I've ever been. Sounds like the trip of a lifetime. It was. It was... it was perfect. I posted pictures on social media... It looked... It looked perfect. I've always wanted to go back, though. Well, all right. Any questions? Yes, ma'am? Not related to the Hawaii package, but just dying to know, are you two an item? Definitely not. Of course not! David is not an item with anyone. David... he stays in shape by running from commitment. And even if I didn't, I would never quite be perfect enough for Terrie. Oh, well... Loved everything about you two out there. You two are the buzz, you're the focal point of "meet the hosts". And I'm sure you've seen your segments numbers lately. Viewership is up, sales are up. You two earned the "monthly pick". We're... hosting the "monthly pick"? Together? Yes! You're gold. You're getting the attention. I met with the board and we have narrowed down our candidates to the top two. You two. Well, that's... that's great! Yeah. Yes. You'll be co-hosting together for the next two weeks through the "monthly pick", where we'll be announcing my replacement. Isn't that exciting? Yeah. Yes! Excuse me. Great. - So... - Great. It's just you and me. Yeah. Working together while competing for the same promotion. Congratulations? Yeah. It's only ten days until the "monthly pick", so we need to figure out what we're gonna sell immediately. This is a crucial decision. I mean, not only is the "monthly pick" the super bowl of segments... It's, you know, quadruple the viewership, quadruple the sales... And it's our audition for Sharyn's spot, so, you know, what we pick shows not only who we are as hosts, but who we are as people, so it has to be something, you know, memorable, something perfect. Or maybe just something cool. - No, it can't just be "cool". - How about this? The "knife champ". It cuts pennies. Do you have a lot of pennies that need cutting? Yeah. Well, what about this olive oil? This is supposed to be the best olive oil. Are you picking up on the floral notes? Maybe some nuttiness? I'm definitely picking up on some nuttiness. Yeah. All right, I have an idea. Why don't you meet me at Riverside Park in 30 minutes? Is this gonna be more of your preparation? Because I... I know, you're about to say, "we need to be sensible". Wah-wa-wah-wa-wah. Wah-wa-wa... what is that? That's how I sound to you? Like a sock puppet? No, no, you sound like one of the grown-ups from Charlie Brown. Riverside Park. 30 minutes. - Hey! - Hi. So, I'm thinking that, like the escape room, we can't sell a product we haven't actually tried. So, a backpack? Well, not just a backpack, but adventure gear meets sophisticated, minimalist design. Perfect to wear while riding... A tandem bike? Believe me, it is a lot more fun than it looks. You're right, this is more fun than it looks. I must look a mess. You? Never. All right, what are we doing now? Next... The next-generation picnic blanket. Lightweight, but with a waterproof underside. But wait! There's more... don't forget this charming pattern, David. How could I ever, Terrie? Or, perhaps... A cheese assortment, featuring mouth-watering flavors that pair perfectly with a fig jam or imported ham. You know, we could bundle it all up into a "date package". Not like a date. Like a... Obligatory work-activity package. Yeah, yeah, I can see it now. "Purchase our terribly-named obligatory work-activity package". Yeah, there's a market for that. Right. Did you always know this was what you wanted to do? Always. I'd go to my grandma's house, and SHC would be on, and we would have tea parties with her SHC-bought tea set while watching "Sharyn's Silver Show" or "Southwestern Style". My grandma would get the SHC Christmas card every year, signed by Sharyn. I loved that card. Sharyn would be smiling on the front, not a hair out of place. That sounds like a nice childhood. Yeah, it was. I mean, it wasn't all roses. My, parents got divorced when I was young and there was a lot of shuttling my brother and me back and forth, you know, a lot of moving, a lot of arguing. I was... I was incredibly shy. - Really? - Yeah. You? Oh, yeah. I think that's why I looked up to Sharyn so much. You know, she just seemed like she could... Befriend anyone, you know, connect with anyone, and I... I just, I wanted to be like that. I'd watch SHC with these perfect houses and perfect hosts, and it was just so different from what I had... I just wanted that perfect life. But it's just actors on a set. Yeah, I know, but I still wanted it. I mean, I still want it. I wonder if you let go of wanting it, you might find that you already have it. That's a surprisingly profound statement. Yeah? Well, I give surprisingly good advice, considering I have no idea what I'm talking about. So what about you? Childhood dreams, fears? The usual stuff. You know, learning to make fire, fighting woolly mammoths... You know, on account of being a caveman and all. I might have been wrong. You're not a caveman. But you are very good at deflecting. So did we find something for our "monthly pick"? No. I'm not quite sold yet. - Nothing seems... - Let me guess. Perfect? You don't have an off-switch, do you? Should we go back to the warehouse and dig around? No, we'll have to do it tomorrow. I have a meeting to get to. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. Hey, David? This was fun. Yeah. David? Ryan Costa. Hi. Nice to put a face to the name. So, you're with Daintree. The nation's largest e-commerce marketplace. And we're getting even bigger, which brings me to the purpose of our meeting. Daintree is launching a new division called "live", featuring live-streamed videos where hosts talk about, and sell, their favorite products. - Like SHC. - Only better. So we're looking for someone with experience to be the face of "live". We're hoping that'll be you. You'd be the flagship name, building the concept from the ground up. That is... Quite an honor. Well, we believe in you. Tell me more. Absolutely. So we do have a formal offer for you, but I'll walk you through what that would entail. How was the meeting yesterday? Well, some big news. Daintree offered me a job heading up their new "live" division. So it would be like SHC, but I'd be the star. Congratulations. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, I don't know if I'm gonna take it, but... You know, it could be pretty big for me. But also you have that promotion at SHC. Yeah, and I like it there. But if I took the Daintree offer, then I could go there and Terrie could have her promotion. So... What are you guys cooking? Beef bour-gen-non. Beef bourguignon for family dinner? Actually, I invited a guest to join us tonight. I told Terrie I'd cook for her. Hey! Hi. I brought you this. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Come on in. What? You were expecting something a little more paleolithic? Maybe a bonfire? A bison on the wall here and there? Well, clearly, you've evolved. Yeah. Come on. So when's your next segment? Tomorrow. We're selling a wireless speaker. Yeah. I was doing some research earlier today. Reading the manufacturer's opinion? No, I was watching videos of couples dancing to music on the speaker. And there was actually some really cute clips, because, after all, "words tell, but emotions sell". This is delicious, by the way. Has David always been such a good cook? I'll let you in on a little secret about David. Please don't. David tries so hard to project this whole devil-may-care bachelor facade, but underneath it all, he's a real softie. And he's been the best brother to me and uncle to Eric. Plus, uncle David's not just my uncle, he's also my best friend. Yeah. Well, you're really lucky to have such a great best friend. I know. And you're so lucky to have such a great co-host. I think we're both pretty lucky. What? What's that smile? Seems like you and Terrie have a little flirtation. We just play it up for the cameras a bit. And so who are you doing it for off-air? All right, yeah, maybe there's a little flirtation. Well, there's nothing wrong with that. Seems like you guys are having fun together. Yeah. It's always fun in the beginning. All right. Goodnight, uncle David. Yeah, goodnight, bud. Don't worry about it. I'm not worried about it. All right, then, let me give you a hand. Thanks. You seem to have a really great relationship with your nephew. Yeah, I get to take care of him a couple days a week after school. We have fun. And how did you learn how to cook? Self-taught. - Really? - Yeah. You know, I realize I actually don't know very much about you. How did you end up at the channel? Well, before SHC, I was in real estate. I owned an agency. Really? Yeah. I always had a knack for selling things, and never really knew what I wanted to do, so becoming a real estate agent made sense. And then I represented a client, who was a producer at SHC, and she recommended I come in for an audition and... Voila. And you were your charming self, of course. Well, it was, it was a little more complicated than that. When I met this producer, I was running the agency with my fiancée. By all accounts, it looked perfect, but it just didn't feel right. Instead, it felt like something I had to do. You know, like vacuuming. Why "vacuuming"? It's just always been the chore I've hated the most. You know, it's like you see the dust building up, and you know you gotta clean, and you put it off forever, and you dread it, and then you finally lug the vacuum out and do it, and the second you're done, there's dust again. It just feels like the opposite of how life should work. But I thought there are no "shoulds". Well, so then what? My fiancée felt it, too. We called off the engagement. I had no idea what to do next. And then I remembered the producer. You found out what you wanted to do with your "one wild and precious life". Yeah. I guess I can kind of understand your aversion to vacuuming. I should probably be getting home. Really? It's still early. Do you want to watch something? Okay. You see anything you like? We should probably catch up on SHC... But there are no "shoulds". - Right. - Right. So... what do you want to watch? Rom-com? Football? Okay, yeah. Are you one of those people who argues for what you want to watch and then falls asleep in 10 minutes? No. I'm not. You are that person. I knew it! No, I'm not. Let me guess, you're one of those people who, once you start watching something, then you have to finish it, even though you hate it? Nope. I have no problem turning it off. But you are that person, I can tell. We'll be watching some Rom-com you picked and... Stop it! I'm not. All right. Rom-com it is. I'm gonna stay awake. I wasn't sleeping. No, you were full-on sleeping. You are that person. No, I was dozing. While I was dozing, I had a really good idea. So we've been getting along... And I actually think we work really well together. You know, I think we make each other better. So I was thinking that instead of competing for Sharyn's spot, we just take the spot together? So we'd both be Sharyn? Well, we would both be ourselves, co-hosting in Sharyn's spot. I think it's a great idea. Yeah? Yeah. Well, thanks. This was really fun. You're welcome. - Okay. - Goodnight. Goodnight. I like the idea of you guys as co-hosts. There's a lot of heart with you. There's some... Something special here, real chemistry. But... SHC will be building a brand around the two of you, together. And, yes, right now, butting heads on the air means real fireworks, but what if it doesn't work out? If, for some reason, that happens, I mean, we're adults, we can figure it out. Yeah. Yeah, but what if it gets old? On-air or... Off? It won't. It won't! It won't. I'll talk to the board A.S.A.P. Great. - Okay! Great! - Okay. Well, that went really well. I think the board might actually consider us. What do you think? I guess we'll see. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I should probably get to wardrobe. Okay. Are you still good to rehearse before our segment? Yeah. Okay. - Hey. - Hey. Look at this new speaker we're going to be selling. Great. Have you seen David? Why? I just need to talk to him. He's probably outside door "c". - Hey. - Hey. Whatcha doing out here? Just basking in the sun. Do you mind if I bask with you? I'd like that. You know your catchphrase, "your one wild and precious life..." You know, I found that poem while I was writing my wedding vows. In a way, I think that's what started it all. That question threw me for a loop. My grandmother loves that poem. I remember the first time she read it to me. It felt like... A call to action. To do something big with my life, something great. But I recently went back and re-read it, and I realized that... She's not saying do something big and great. All she did was just go for a walk. But she was so... Present in that. She was really there. Look, I know that... You're scared that this is gonna feel like vacuuming, and I get it. And I can't guarantee you that it won't. But I think we should try. All right, so, you wanna do the intro, and then I'll launch into product specs? "This is an indoor/outdoor speaker..." Or, or... You could do the intro and I could launch into the product specs. In order to do that, you would've had to have read... The instruction manual? Surprise! Okay. So then we'll cue the music, and, I'll go over the features and the app... What if, instead of talking, we just dance? You wanna just dance? And, you know, we talk about how, with this speaker, our viewers can turn any moment into a spontaneous moment. Okay, so, so we dance. Yeah. Cue the music. Are you classically trained? 18 years of ballet. Can you tell? So, something like that? Yeah. David. You have a visitor. Who? Noah. I wanted to talk to you about Terrie. Okay. See... I want her back and I was wondering if you could help me. Do you think Terrie wants that? I mean, you... You really hurt her, Noah. I know. I... I made a mistake. See, the night before I sent all those texts, she brought up marriage, and I got scared, I didn't know what I wanted, but I've had a chance to think about it, and I miss her. Terrie and I, we just... We make sense, so I was hoping that you could help me. Hi. Sharon needs you in the conference room. One minute. What'd you have in mind? Terrie. David. Just wanted to check in. At our last meeting, I tried not to pry... But after seeing that rehearsal, I think it's better if I did. Now, you know I think you're wonderful on air... But my question is, before we move forward with you replacing me as co-hosts, what exactly is happening off-air? Well... Actually... Nothing. Then what was that I saw out there? What was that? That was us playing up on our chemistry for our fans. It's a little flirting. But come on, there is nothing between us. It's me and Terrie. Yeah, it's us. I mean, there couldn't be two more mismatched people. We're strictly professional. David and I are just co-hosts. Terrie, David... This is not some kind of gameshow. This is a business. I am not upset about my conversation with Sharyn and David at all. I'm great, actually. Everything's fine. If there was ever a gray area in David and my's relationship that's thankfully been rectified and now we are just strictly professional. David and I are just co-hosts. I am just something else he has to vacuum. Sharyn wants to meet you at the cafe. Okay! Great! It's a bit early in the day for champagne, but we can still celebrate the exciting news. The board has decided to replace me with you two as co-hosts. Congratulations! That's awesome! Thank you. Yeah, thank you. Now, that's not quite the reaction I expected. No, I'm... I'm grateful. I... I just need to give the idea of co-hosting a bit more consideration. You do? Okay, but the "monthly pick" is in two days and, as I told you, we would like to use that segment to announce the news to our viewers. Okay? So we need to know. Sure. Hey! You don't want to co-host anymore? It's not that I don't want to. It's... it's kind of confusing between us. Things are complicated and... I got offered a new job, heading up Daintree's live division. And you want to leave for that? I don't want to. But maybe it simplifies things. I go to Daintree. You take Sharyn's spot. Or we could both take Sharyn's spot together. But what if it gets old, right? It's not that. Production needs to know what item you've chosen for the "monthly pick". We're on it. - Thanks. - Cool. So, I just heard... You two still haven't decided on an item for the "monthly pick"? We, we just decided right now. Okay, good. What is it? A vacuum. Yeah. I mean, you might not want to vacuum anymore, but other people still do. Okay, David, I just got your message saying you want to be replaced on the guest seller segment today. Yeah, I was thinking Terrie could replace me. Terrie, do you want it? Sure, yeah. Look that them. The brilliance of that diamond... It's a five-carat radiant-cut diamond with flawless clarity. It has three carats of tapered baguette-cut diamonds set in a custom-made platinum mount. It is just stunning. I think our viewers would love to own this piece. Speaking of viewers, why don't we take a caller? Hi there. You're on with Terrie. Terrie, it's Noah. Noah? Thank you for calling. Is there something you're interested in here on air? Well, actually, yes, I'm interested in that engagement ring... ...Because... Zoom in on Noah. There's something I'd like to ask you. You were right. We like the same things, we want the same things. We make sense. And I know it's a big step, but... It's the next step. So, Terrie... Will you marry me? And that's all the time we have for today. We'll see you again back here real soon. All right. Everybody take five, please. Oh, Noah. I'm so sorry. I can't do this. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. David? - Hey. - Why aren't you on stage? Did you know that Noah was gonna propose? Is that why you asked me to replace you? He really wants to be with you. Isn't what you want? I... no. I... that's what I thought I wanted, it's what I thought I should want. But I was wrong. I don't want Noah. What do you want? I took the Daintree job. Why? We both get what we want. It, it makes sense. No, I don't... I don't want that. I want to host with you. David, don't pretend that you took the job to be chivalrous. You took the job because... You're too scared to get locked into something with me, because that concept is like an escape room to you. That's not true. Well, congratulations. You figured out the secret... Work backwards from the thing that's stopping you. So when do you start Daintree? Two weeks. I want Terrie to take Sharyn's spot. You could've taken it together. Yeah, but I thought Terrie was getting engaged and married, and I didn't want to be there for that. But you said she's not getting engaged. She is not. Then I'm a little confused because it seems like you could have exactly what you want. So what's the problem? The problem is that I've tried this before, and it didn't work, and what if the same thing happens again? But what if it doesn't? David, there are always going to be times in life when it feels like vacuuming. That is life. But you've been lucky enough to find someone that you want to vacuum with. Is everyone at work talking about it? No, no. Of course not. No. It's okay, you can tell me. Maybe a little talk. It was pretty dramatic. Noah's live proposal... David's announcement that he's leaving. Personally, I was rooting for you and David. I know, I was kind of rooting for us, too. Which is so dumb of me, because I-I know David. I know how he is. You know, and I still fell for him. And that's okay. I just don't know how I let this happen. You know, he's the exact opposite of what I said I always wanted. It's just the way that I felt around him was like I didn't have to be anyone. You know, I could just be myself and be loved for it. And you are loved for it. Thanks. How am I supposed to do the "monthly pick" with him tomorrow? I just don't know how to pretend that it's okay. Maybe you just don't pretend. "Monthly pick" in five. Hi. Hi. I remember you walking in here 10 years ago. P.A., big dreams. Now look at you. Replacing me. Well, no one could ever replace you. But you've been an inspiration to me from the beginning, so thank you. Well, I think you and I are quite similar. You do? I used to run myself ragged trying to be the perfect host, wife, mother, because I thought, if I was "enough", I'd be loved. Then, I got to the end of my rope, and I had this sort of reckoning, and I realized that seeking all that kind of perfection, it was leading me nowhere. And that I was already perfect just the way I was! Imperfect. Enough. Loved. Hey. Hi. I'm Terrie Carpenter. And I'm David Crabtree. This "monthly pick", we bring you the "total vacuum". This machine does it all... Nooks, crannies, carpets, hardwood floors, whatever you need. It's got you covered. But David, let's get real here, right? This is a wonderful vacuum, yes. But it's still just a vacuum. It'll do the job day in and day out. But over the weeks, months, years, it might not be so exciting. There might be days where you don't feel like vacuuming at all. 'Cause it's just a vacuum. It's not gonna make your life perfect. You know, I used to believe that I had to have the perfect vacuum, the perfect boyfriend, the perfect job... That if I just projected an image of perfection, then maybe I would believe it, too. But the thing is, is that we'll never own anything or buy anything that will change the way we see ourselves. 'Cause only we can do that. But, if in the midst of your journey of self-betterment, you do find that your home is dusty, then this is the vacuum for you. This is the only vacuum you'll ever want because it'll make you realize that cleaning isn't a chore. You really like this vacuum, David. It has my lifetime warranty, Terrie. I'm sorry. I got scared. But you... Are what I want to do with my one wild and precious life. And... A special announcement for our viewers... Some of you may have heard that Sharyn St. Clair is retiring. Well, the amazing Terrie Carpenter will be replacing her. Although, I still want to co-host. I was hoping you'd say that. Where were we? But wait. There's more. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
