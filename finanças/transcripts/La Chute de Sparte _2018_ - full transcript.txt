I'm 16 and my name is Steve Simard, with 2 Es. My parents associate English with success. So, they doubled my chances of success. Pathetic. Worse than that, I'll never forgive them for my Nazi initials. But you can be born in a pigsty without thinking you're a pig. I live in St Lambert. It really pisses me off. It's a pretentious, hypocritical suburb. A snobby old lady who courts the river as she's fucked by the boulevard, this masterpiece of modern ugliness. Like all suburbs, it's dehumanized, devoid of beauty and conformist. My street is hopelessly banal. Our house is a castle of comfort and indifference. The decor of a tidy life, neat, sanitized and bland, straight out of a Scandinavian decoration magazine. It's as beautiful as a tomb. Nothing indicates my presence. My parents each have a sink, but 3 sinks didn't work, so I don't have a sink. The place I live is in the basement. A good basement should always be moist, dark, smelly and messy. That way, they won't install a home theater or a gym they'll never use anyway. "You must keep dreaming. You must keep dreaming, always. Stay true to your childhood dreams. They're the only ones." Pierre Bourgault This is my room. The only territory where I exercise full sovereignty. Last year, I went too far with the mess. My father tripped over my caving equipment and hit his head. It was time to clean the Augean stables and it was a Herculean task. Don't ask where I'm from I'm from where my legs take me I walk with only my courage I hate fakes Give respect to those who take it Those who do as they like Who are true to themselves Live and let live Could be my slogan For some, I'm shit For others, emotion rains down A human torrent from the veins of my life OK, I'm not perfect. Are you? I see too much falsehood From studying people I hate the left like a Cuban I'm responsible for myself Not for what others think I'll let you speak and I'll go deaf Fuck your advice I make my music I bought my first beats And patented 'em You called your ma for money I paid her rent You ran like a chicken I'm in a pack of hyenas No-one screws me My cash won't fit in my pocket Chechen mentality A jet setter with crooked teeth Fuck the MC starlets I prefer Jean Leloup No red carpets I walk on a bed of nails Don't ask where I'm from I'm from where my legs take me I walk with only my courage I hate fakes Give respect to those who take it Those who do as they like Who are true to themselves Live and let live Could be my slogan For some, I'm shit For others, emotion rains down A human torrent from the veins of my life OK, I'm not perfect. Are you? I know artists who work hard But get nothing back They cook, but eat out of a dog's bowl I don't trust people who kill for oil They release an album Then, they screw you Whatever adults think, youth is hybrid and unclassifiable. I'm not in any gang. I won't be defined by advertisers or sociologists. Hey, millennials, my ass! Life isn't a cola ad. My friends aren't on Facebook. They don't like your selfies. They'd give you a kidney. I have more kidneys than friends. Actually, I just have one,Virgil. Real friends are like gold dust. "Your house is a reflection of your soul." (Creole) - What're you looking for? - My windsurfing board! Here. Hurry, you'll be late for class. Nothing's uglier than a school. It's a mix of East German government bunkers, maximum security penitentiaries and credit unions. A laboratory of bad ideas from the 70s. Ours is called Gaston Miron, but everyone says GM. Imagine, the great poet reduced to an American car maker. But what else is a school than a diploma factory? Year after year, hundreds of us roll off the assembly line, polished and formatted, ready for the adult world. Fortunately, my ordeal is coming to an end. The only oasis of beauty in this ugly desert is the immense mosaic of Gaston Miron's face. It's really well done. It looks like Stalin on Red Square, but the dude looks so modest, his portrait doesn't seem pretentious. The bottom is smeared with graffiti. As graffiti artists love red, it looks like he's had his head cut off. It's terrible and great. Like adolescence. In a 4-stroke engine, there are 4 phases that convert fuel energy into motion. First: intake. The valve lets the air-fuel mixture enter the cylinder. Giroux! Your coat. 2nd stage: compression. The piston compresses the air-fuel mixture. The explosion, or combustion. The spark plug makes the mixture explode, causing the piston to lower. Sava rd! The movement of the piston drives the crankshaft which transmits the movement to the wheels. Last, the exhaust. The piston rises and lets the gases escape through a 2nd valve. Sorry, Paulin. I'm in my exhaust phase. Right... The more cylinders, the more power. Most cars have 4 cylinders, sports cars have up to 12. My Mustang had 8. You had a Mustang? I was young once, too. - What model? - Boss 302. 1970. O to 100 in 6.9. - How fast did you go? - Very fast. - How fast? - Too fast. How fast? 150. That's nothing. 150 mph. 240 km/h. We didn't use seat belts. We had a bottle of beer between our legs. Well, times have changed, of course. I wouldn't advise it, because it's too fast. Every year, to welcome us, the school gives all the students a copy of "The Raggedy Man", Gaston Miron's masterpiece. During the autumn, you find these abandoned, mutilated books all over school. Many also find it very convenient to roll up joint filters with the pages. To say most students don't care about "Companions of the Americas" is an understatement. But the school persists, and that's to its credit. We don't stop sowing as some seeds will rot without yielding corn. I wanted to play football. but wasn't athletic enough. I wish I had friends, but wasn't popular enough. I wanted a girl, but wasn't handsome enough. Instead of practicing with my friends while my girl applauded, I read in my room. That's when l found Miron. Actually, he fell on me. "The Raggedy Man" was just the thing. Without friends, a girl or plans, I too was a raggedy guy. Reading totally saved me. You're never alone with a book. "Everyone's feet in their steps Everyone's tears in their eyes Everyone's hand begging In ships, everyone has their dreams Yearning for gunpowder in their desires And for nebulas in their thoughts At dinner, everyone their bite Everyone their neck in love Everyone Everyone Everyone their bones in the cemetery" What a mess! Nothing ever gets done without me. Nothing's been done in over a week! "A special survey by Nathalie St-Jacques reveals that 82% of teenagers are happy." Wouldn't you like to be in the majority? It's an opinion poll. They can make anyone say anything. If it's representative, the results are accurate. - Don't they teach you that? - OK... So, when someone I don't know calls to ask if I'm happy, I'll say: "No. I'm as unhappy as hell. I want to jump off the bridge." Filling out questionnaires, you're being filled like a turkey. Keep sleepwalking. Keep believing in your polls. Don't worry, your kids are happy. Yeah, don't clear up, Mr. Grumpy. Your bag. The document I'm distributing right now is to validate your knowledge. The document I'm distributing right now is to validate your knowledge. Maxime, your gum, please. So, it's a test, if you like. It's more technical than the personal work you did last week. It's due next week. Steve, your hood. So, Monday. The Marquis de Sade, Donatien Alphonse Frangois de Sade... I like this teacher a lot. A 35-year-old with a nice fringe and a perfect behind. When she writes on the board, no one listens. Everyone delights in this wonderful butt which always looks good. Film, music, theater, literature: she finds all sorts of ways of interesting us. I'm OK, I'm convinced. He died in St Maurice on December 2, 1814. Thank you. Goodbye, everyone. Steve, phase come here. Your text on "Philosophy in the Boudoir". Yes? I really... ...really liked it. - Really? Oh, yes. I think you master the language so well... Your work. I've got it. Sorry. Thanks. Have a good day. That's Mathieu St-Amour, Spartans quarterback, the demigod of the school. The archetypal model student who excels in class and on the field. He's the only one in the league who passes 60 yards. He was even spotted by the Nebraska Corn huskers. Nebraska what? Corn huskers. Your sister's horny, not corny! Hey, not my sister! I'd fuck your sister in a thong! Not a chance! Why is the flag of Quebec always in tatters? Hey. Vlrg! My cousin said to give you that back. What? The big mama? What? She's good-hearted. Dude! Shut up! Life isn't easy That's why we stick together... Was it fun? More than here. 'Night. 'Night, Mr. Grumpy. Véronique Plourde. As bright as an October afternoon. She's always been in my dreams without knowing I existed. I watched her from afar, like a field to harvest. An unreachable horizon. Maxime Giroux, captain of the Spartans' defense, known throughout the league for his bone-crunching tackles. A ruthless war machine. Off the field, he's an ignorant dumb that I despise with a vengeance. But I would never have the courage to say that to his face. Hello. OK, everybody. Everybody, please. Thank you. You need to use your sticks today. You're not little kids. "Poop", ha-ha! Sorry, I was using my stick in the shower! Max, Virgil, pick the teams. Sava rd. Steve. - Walker. - Véro. Pass, pass! - Let's go Virgil, you're the best! - Come on Latreille. Max! Calm down or you're out. Calm down. He'll be all right. OK? Yeah. Eyes that burn, hands and feet on fire We run away to dance on the clouds We'll be dreaming kids forever I found the green in my white nights I carve "I love you" on a tree Apparently it hurts Maybe it could understand There are blades at my back Birds cry with joy Pretty baby, cry Warm tears on my cold heart With you I'm calm I'm a train that derails Lethal injection for my dogs Lying on the slab Analyze my stone heart We collect stars in color-blind paradise Eyes the color of rare birds We'll die loving life The stars surround us To crown the parts of us Which have never been seen Which have always been known The stars surround us To crown the parts of us Which have never been seen Which have always been known Folks, for the first time, the first star, number 17! Steve Simard! Véronique Plourde. It took a warrior act to reveal myself to her. Now she'd kissed me, I could at last send a friend request. She'd never looked at me. Since this afternoon, I was carved in the marble of her kleos. I'd avenged Patroclus, beat Hector. And I loved Roxane. I was Achilles and I was Cyrano. I could hear Le Bret telling me: "You love her. Tell her! You covered yourself in glory in her eyes today!" Excuse me. - Can you knock? - Didn't I knock? No, you didn't. I will, next time. You say that, but you don't. I will, next time. I promise. Hey, Ma, come on! Fine Mr. Grumpy. What're you listening to? - What? - What's that? Eminem. The chocolates have done a song? - How's school? - OK. I saw you didn't touch last month's allowance. I want to buy a new caving kit. Coming with us to Eastman tomorrow? No, I'll stay here. Invite Gilles over. It's Virgil, Ma. - Did you apply to Champlain? - It's September! And I don't want to study in English. We Amazons have fun attacking thrones We show up in a gang We set the world to rights Lion heart ladies Ladies in a hurry Work it, girls No end to the effort Artemis, Athena, Demeter and Persephone There are stages between whore and mama We descend from Mount Olympus We've had enough of this We've got to get it moving We're running the show We give the slaps Metal cores We're on the move We're running the show We give the slaps Vital combat To avoid a dead end Simard, sick goal you scored! He's the guy who fucked Giroux! Good job, man! Thanks to the cheerleaders of Gaston Miron School! Welcome to the game between Asterix Farnham and your Spartans... - Virgil: Back ache thanks to Giroux. Can't come. - Steve: Fuck Giroux! Here's Mathieu St-Amour! Blue 22! Blue 22! Hut! It's a quick pass to slot back Louis Dutil and he's taken down after a gain of 6 yards for the Spartans. Right, Orlando. QB draw. Ready? Blue 22! He fakes the pass and it's a quarterback draw! Look out, he's got some room! He's at the 45! And it's a 23-yard gain! First down, Gaston Miron! And the general takes matters into his own hands! Mathieu "too strong for the league" St-Amour! The Asterix have their hands full. It's a 50-yard bomb caught by Lafleur who gets away from coverage. Lafleur to the 20! Still going, he's at the 10! They're not going to catch him! Touchdown! Gaston Miron! Like the poem, it's "The March to Love"! Lafleur celebrates with the rest of his teammates! 24 to 6, Spartans! This is an absolute annihilation on the battlefield! Nothing can stand in the way of this well oiled war machine! They're on our field, boys! We'll kill 'em! Dropped in the backfield by middle line backer Maxime Giroux! Loss of a yard. The Asterix are being completely dominated! Cover the middle! Cover the middle! - I got it! - Green 18! Red! Hut! Yeah baby! Eat the dirt! Eat it! Watch the swing pass! Giroux is a beast, he's a monster! And this game is over! Hey. Hello. You jumped on that guy like a monkey! Why does everyone know? It's had 2,000 views on YouTube. Giroux is mad at you. Gotta go. My dad's here. Watch out, Steve. - Search for: "giroux lacrosse" - Giroux scores at lacrosse - He's pissed - That's it my dood! Use your power, Steve. - LMAO - Hope those legs can run Simard!!! - Steve:Shopping mall? - Virgil: Sorry, cousins here :( - Steve:Watch out for those kissing cousins! ;) - Virgil: You watch out for Giroux. 'Morning, Mr. Grumpy! I saved you some casserole. Make a salad. See you tomorrow, love you. Mom I looked at it from every angle, but I was in deep shit. Alone in the Circus Maximus, I faced Menelaus's fury. He'd start the Trojan War just over a lacrosse game. Giroux wanted to beat me up. Véronique was avoiding me. Clearly, I was missing something. If it were the end of the world I wouldn't move any more than that Death is not great enough To tum us away from our 'gays If it were the end of the world I wouldn't move any more than that - Virgil: Watch out for Giroux tomorrow! - Steve: I'll use the back door... - Virgil: I'll keep an eye out for ya. - Steve: thanx Damn. - Steve: I'm at the back door - Virgil: Stay there, Giroux at front Simard! Steve Simard! The school's new idol! Why are you here? Avoiding Giroux? He beat me up, too. He beat me up, too. I'd just started wearing glasses. Christophe Latreille. His face is devastated by acne. His skin eruptions formed a volcanic chain His skin eruptions formed a volcanic chain from the forehead to the neck. Some pustules were topped by a whitish dome full of viscous sebum. Despite a lively mind and biting humor, he was always alone. And you? Dunno. I gotta go. I spoke to Giroux. Nothing you can do. Good shot, Simard. Sick, man! - Mr. Popular! - Enough! It's just a game. No, he's pissed off with you and Véro. No, he's pissed off with you and Véro. - What? - Her tits were in your face. What's that to Giroux? Dude, he's her ex! Wake up! They dated till he broke her arm. That was him? That was him? Steve... Giroux and Véro. Hades and Persephone. Giroux and Véro. Hades and Persephone. The eternal fascination with bad boys. What are you doing here, Maxime? Go to class. You too, Steve! Come on! Please hurry and sit down. Please hurry and sit down. First of all, congratulations to the Spartans. Nice win. Maxime, bravo! Player of the game. If you could try as hard in class, that'd be great! So, today, we'll work on your oral presentations. If you have any questions, come see me in my office... - I haven't seen him. - Nor me. Dammit. Where is he? Where is he? Don't worry, we'll get him. He can't hide forever. After school, have a look. You wait at the back door. I'll wait outside his classroom. You wait at the back door. I'll wait outside his classroom. We'll get him. - We'll get him. - All right. - We'll get you, dammit! - You bastard! Sonovabitch! Sonovabitch! "You must keep dreaming. You must keep dreaming, always. Stay true to your childhood dreams. They're the only ones." Pierre Bourgault If I decided to stay here, nobody would find me. Even Not even Giroux. Where were the heroes in my books when I needed them? Ulysses, Hercules, Achilles? Ulysses, Hercules, Achilles? Why didn't they kick Giroux's ass? I'd read the entire library of Alexandria, but was powerless in reality. This time, the solution was not in books. Unfortunately, I'm back, like the recession I rap at close range MCs get a depression They see I'm coming Chechen style They're almost dead like the church I wanna climb the podium, pockets full I wanna climb the podium, pockets full But I know my album won't make the Top 10 I take life as it is Few understand me The main thing is to do what we love I do it, it's real big stuff I keep on explaining it to you I keep on explaining it to you I give it my all, it makes purists happy You can test... How'd you like it if we made fun of you on YouTube? How are you? Véro? M'! eve... Don't worry, it's just your eyebrow. Don't worry, it's just your eyebrow. What happened? How'd you like it if we made fun of you on YouTube? Cowards! Cowards! Wasn't it enough to break my goddam arm? You'll look good on YouTube! - You're not laughing now. - Really, guys. You really took your sweater off? Not my top,though! - Giroux is suspended. - I should hope so! - Giroux is suspended. - I should hope so! I can't believe he did that to you. It's coming off tomorrow. Will you sign it? I owe you a sweater. See you soon. - 1 notification - Véronique accepted your friend request You OK? I'm going to bed. - Access Gallery You say you'd like to die But look at you You're beautiful as the biggest dream Life loves you Life loves you You're beautiful as the biggest dream Life loves you Life loves you You say you'd like to run Far, far away from you You say you'd like to run Far, far away from you You're everything they want to be A ballet of forests We live in a vacuum We often die But how do we stay hungry? The be“... Everything alright? Please go on, Véro. It was used over fur coats in winter. They tied it securely to support their backs. They kept their fur inventory by knotting the fringes for beaver, otter or marten pelts. It's waterproofed with beeswax, so it could be used to drink water. The belt is a perfect metaphor for Quebec society as it's more mixed than we think. I have lnnu blood from my grandmother. Your turn, Steve. - Old people thnk we cant write properly. We do make mistakes when we text, but at least we are writing. Never in the history of humanity have young people written as much. I think it's good news. We're making writing evolve. Emoticons, say, add an emotional nuance. Language isn't regressing. It improves and evolves. In its most refined form, Arabic eliminates vowels. What if texting were the ultimate form of written language? To understand an abbreviation, you need to know the spelling of the word. Adults don't understand kids' texts, so texting is bad. Maybe we're encoding what we say on purpose, so adults don't understand. Thank you very much. - You OK? - Yeah, you? - Yeah, you? - Yeah. Coming tonight? - Where? - To the party. Oh, yeah. - OK, see you tonight. - Yeah. Don't move. Perfect! - Did you do that? - Cool, huh? Sick! You won't get laid tonight. You're menstruating! - What's up, Steve? - Hey. I hear you're going to Nebraska. It's not certain yet. - Congratulations. - Cheers, pal. I can't, I'm taking antibiotics for my eye. Don't be a fag. - Are you naked under there? - Wanna check? I'm good. He's a Spartan, not a Scot! - See you, guys. - Bye. See you soon. Here. The alcohol will stop your eye getting infected. Take it easy, soldier! Seen Véro? - Seen Véro? - What? - Véro! - What? - Have you seen Véro? - No, I haven't. Very nice costume. It's... ...original. Guys! Well, have a good evening. Have fun. Bye. Separatists are over. They gotta brought up to speed. Their buddies... Why isn't she here? It's not even 9 PM. The teachers who indoctrinate kids... "With Groleau, I." Q \ \ \ \ \ \ k 'i \ \ \ \ \ 1._ Cool, your outfit is super absorbent! Véro! You look like a real winner! Champion, look at this. Véro! You don't want that on YouTube! Delete. Relax, man. You got wasted, it happens. Coming to the game? Drink some water. Steve, the leaves! I'll wait outside. By pressing "delete", I'd erased the image, not the shame. I couldn't look her in the eye again. If only I could make Véro disappear from my memory as easily as I'd erased her from Virgil's phone. The Cup isn't going to Longueuil this year, understand? Simard, you were so wasted! - You were in overdrive. - Hey, Simard! Harlem Shake! Thanks to the cheerleaders of Gaston Miron who dazzle us with their talent. - Menstruating again? - It won't come off. Let's go, Spartans! ...your Spartans who are coming off an undefeated regular season. There's the kickoff! It's caught by number 86, Luc "Chénéloze", with a 3-yard return. First down Spartans! Who's that guy? A talent scout from Nebraska to check out St-Amour. The Americans are real pros. The Eagles just barely snuck into the playoffs from the backdoor. They're going to have their hands full with the Spartans, who'll stop at nothing to bring the Cup home this year. There's the snap, here comes the pressure. It's an air ball that's almost intercepted by the Eagles safety Christian Fournier. St-Amour might want that one back. He had to get rid of it on his back foot, the blitz was all over him. He must blame himself. The Eagles are showing they're not intimidated. Don't count your chickens before they're hatched. Too low! St-Amour can recover but lost 7 yards. That was a serious lack of communication between St-Amour and the center. The Spartans are going to have to regroup. St-Amour seems completely disoriented. Nothing is working for the Spartans. What a shit game! St-Amour's playing real bad. If only Giroux were here... It's a pity he got suspended. It's your fault too for provoking him. Giroux is a bastard. - I'm hungry. Want a hotdog? - Yep. Giroux's suspension is hurting the Spartans' defense. Let's go Spartans! Here you go, kid. And it's the end of the game. Incredible, the Spartans were slaughtered by the Longueuil Eagles, 31-3. It's like the Battle of Thermopylae. What a wipe-out. - Hey, have you seen Virgil? - Nope. Good game, big guy. What're you doing here, man? I was looking for you. I'll wait outside. Keep your mouth shut. Don't freak out. Keep it shut! - Don't worry... - You damn fag, I knew it! What're you doing here? - It's OK, I won't tell. - Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off! - You're gay! - Shut up. You played for the other team long? I don't, really. I'm more like Deion Sanders and Bo Jackson. I like football, but I like baseball, too. What about you and St-Amour? It's the first time. He's chicken. He wants to, he doesn't want to. It's messed up, man. Don't tell my dad. Don't worry. - Virgil: 6 missed calls What? "I'm exhausted, worn out, lacking in fire." La Fontaine I'm at Gaston Miron junior high where a young student's suicide has shaken everyone. The Spartans' quarterback was found hanging from one of the goalposts on the school football field. - On this cold Friday of November, an entire school is grieving... - What happened? - Did anyone suspect anything? - See you buddy. By the way Nathalie, are you still convinced that 82% of teenagers are happy? Post Poor parents! I can't imagine... Yeah... Poor kid. Killing yourself because you lose a football game... His grades weren't good enough for college. You don't kill yourself for that. There are other colleges. You don't know, so shut up. Don't talk to me like that, Steve. You talk nonsense! You just repeat what the TV and papers say! He didn't kill himself over a football game! - What do you know? - He hung himself 'cause of me! I saw him with a guy. 2 hours later, he killed himself. Happy now? It's my fault he killed himself. If I hadn't seen you, he'd still be alive. I'm still alive. Maybe it was because of the shitty game. Who knows? Deep down, St-Amour was a real Spartan. The Spartan army encouraged couples. They watched out for each other. It boosted team spirit. The most powerful army in antiquity was gay? He'd have been happy in Sparta. What'll you wear? - How about braces? - Braces? Yes, good idea. Braces? Try these on. - What? - I want to see how you look. There are people here. What? You're handsome, son. Jeez... Ready? Can you help me? Sure. Hang on. The main thing is to start right. You go around... Did you know him well? Well, yeah. How do you feel? I don't feel like going. I don't know what to do. Offer your condolences to the family. And... And say goodbye to your friend. FUNERAL HOME The whole school turned out to pay a final homage to our General St-Amour. Achilles, the demigod who all believe was invincible, dead on the battlefield. No one could believe it. If he had no future, what hope was there for the rest of us? I know, it won't come off. I wouldn't have said anything. "Everyone's feet in their steps Everyone's tears in their eyes Everyone's hand begging In ships, everyone has their dreams Yearning for gunpowder in their desires And for nebulas in their thoughts At dinner, everyone their bite Everyone their neck in love Everyone Everyone Everyone their bones in the cemetery" The time has come To let go of the ties To leave the tears behind To dance your body We'll be up to it Pleasures we put in each other's hearts Long silences Which don't care about tomorrow The end of the semester dragged on. I hadn't seen Giroux since St-Amour's funeral. Two warriors had fallen, I was still standing, a goddess at my side. Every kid leaving junior high is a Greek hero who completes a quest. With college around the corner, the best lies ahead for tortured high-school students. So, there is hope after the fall of Sparta.
