July August Productions Presents A film by Eitan Green "It All Begins At Sea" (3 childhood scenes and death) Scene One: The Sea Ow. It's hot. Ow! Boy, it's hot. What are you laughing about? It's like fire! I've never felt anything so hot. It's quite pleasant over here. -Right... pleasant. Here, Give that to me. Let's stay here. This is good. -Where? -Here, where we are. Just like that? Here? Why? -Why not? There's Tuvia. I knew he'd be here today. Come here, you piece of shit. Get out of the water, there's an undercurrent. Hey, you shithead! I don't like it here. Let's move. -But why? Tuvia's here! What's so great about that? He's an animal. Why? He's fun. He takes the kids out on his surfboat and everything. "Everything"? What's "everything"? That's exactly the reason I don't want to stay here. Let's go. What's wrong with that Tuvia guy? He likes children too much. -So what? I do too. What's wrong with that? He's a homo. He takes the kids out to sea on his surfboat and God knows what he does with them out there. Here. This is great. And there's hardly any people here. -Great. Come on, Noah. You're pitching the tent already? Wait, let's enjoy the water. We'll pitch the tent, it'll be more comfortable. "More comfortable," sure. You'll just lie down inside and go to sleep. Why can't we enjoy the water for once? What are you getting upset about? I'm fed up with your arguing. Always arguing. About everything. You're fed up? Really? You know what? Give me the mattress, I'm fed up with all of you and I want to go in the water. Dad, can you inflate the mattress for me, please? Give it to me, I'll finish it up. Here, give it to me. It's alright. Thank you. No. -What do you mean, "no"? Apologize. I'm sorry. I'm a little upset today, I don't even know why. Thank you. They have the whole beach but they have to come here? Yehuda! Come on, let's start working on the tent. Udi, come and help. Udi, three pieces, each one inside another makes one pole. I don't understand this. No! It's... You hold it there, just like that. Give this to Dad. -Give it to me, here. Hello, excuse me for interrupting. My name is Eduardo. Eduardo Shiffer. -Hello. I'd like to ask you something, if that's alright? -Sure. Are you from around here? -Yes, l mean, I'm originally from Jerusalem, but my wife is from here. -I'm from here. -We all are. I'd like to know what do you call this beach. Barnea. Barnea beach. That's what everyone calls it. Great, and why do you come here, specifically, if I may ask? Because it's isolated, quiet. My wife likes this beach. Dad, look! -Hello, my beauty. Come here, come here. That's all she's interested in, brides. She thinks a groom will come from the sea so she's ready. It was in some book she read. -Udi! Udi, come in. Come in, the water's great. -Come over afterwards, okay, Udi? What's wrong, Udi? What are you looking at? Get in already. But be careful, Udi. Noah, let's continue working on the tent. It's fun here, isn't it? -Yes, it is. But maybe later we can go back to the other beach? To that Tuvia guy? No way. Did you know that his brother is the strongest man in Ashkelon? Really? How do you know? -Benny told me. He was the national wrestling champion. But Tuvia is stronger than him. Sorry. -That's okay, nothing happened. Wow... you know, you're a very pretty bride. Who's the groom? -Dad. Great. You know, the best place to play is between Dad and the water. Go Tell your Mom. Aren't we drifting away a little? Yehuda! Yehuda! Dad! Look where they got to. Dad! Yehuda! Dad! -We think your wife is drowning. I saw first. Wait here and call for help. Dina, Yehuda's coming. Yehuda's coming, Dina. Don't worry. He'll be there in a second. Everything will be all right. Why did you come here, Yehuda? -What do you mean, why? I wanted you to call for help. Now what? You'll drown with us? You can hardly swim. Fine, never mind. Just rest. There's no air in the mattress. It's losing air. But You've just inflated it! You're right, there must be a hole somewhere. We inflated it at home too, and when we got here it was already out of air. Noah! Noah, get a lifeguard! Noah! -Just relax, I'll go in. You stay here. You didn't tell me your son doesn't know how to swim. He's her husband, not my son. -Take this. Look how beautifully Dad swims. Like a swan. He won't make it, it's too far. He'll drown too. Why would you say a thing like that. Thank you. -Thank you so much. Thank you. -There isn't enough air in the mattress. We know. It's losing air. There's a hole somewhere. Come on, kick together with me towards the beach. Come on. We're not moving. There's an undercurrent here. Yes I feIt it, it was nice at first. Maybe just take the boy? -What?! We'll manage. Come, Udi. Hold him tight, Udi. -Come. Hold on tight. I'll get someone. Thank you very much. -Be careful! Hold on to my shoulders. Good. Good. Wait, wait, not my neck. -The shoulders, Udi. Not my neck, not my neck. -Careful, Udi. The shoulders, Udi, not the neck. The shoulders! The shoulders, not the neck... -not the ne... Udi, not the neck! Udi! Udi! Udi! What are you doing? -What are you doing? Oh my God, Yehuda! -He almost killed me! What's wrong with him? Do something, Yehuda. Udi! Udi! Udi! I dove underwater I couldn't find you anywhere. Mom, enough. Dad, stop it. I'm fine. Udi... I was so scared. He almost drowned you, that idiot. What will we do, Yehuda? Are we just going to drown out here? Stop it, Dina, we will be fine. We're all here now. That's all that matters. Look. The mattress isn't losing air anymore. Lifeguard! Over there, over there! There's Tuvia! Tuvia! -Tuvia! Tuvia! You don't care that it's that Tuvia guy? -Now? Here? He could be Muammar Kaddafi for all I care. -Right. Tuvia! -Tuvia! -Tuvia! That's not Tuvia. It's Rafi, his new assistant. Rafi! -Rafi! Rafi! -Rafi! There he is! There he is! Here! Dina! -Stay clear! Stay clear! Let her breathe. -Dina! What happened? -We got off and she fainted. It's okay he knows what he's doing, She'll be okay and up in a minute. How do you know? -Trust me, I know. Go and rest too. Take your son to lie down in the tent. He's not my son, he's her husband. Come on, Yehuda. Wait, what about Dina? -She'll be okay, they're taking care of her. I'll take the tent down It will take a minute. What are you talking about, Noah? "Take down the tent? " That's Tuvia, the head lifeguard. -What's going on, kid? It's my mother. -Let me, Rafi. Excuse me, whose girl is this? I'm sorry, she's mine, I'm sorry. That's my groom! Dressed in white, just like in the book. No, sweetie. A groom is all dressed in white, shirt and trousers as well. Is she also your family? -No. You trying to drive me crazy? -It's Tuvia, he just resuscitated you. Pleased to meet you, I'm Dina Goldstein. A pleasure, Tuvia. How do you feel? -Better now, thank you. Thank you very much. I'll just sit here for a while. The sea is dangerous. -Yes, I know. It won't happen again, I'm sorry. It's about time you learned how to swim, kid. Rafi, take the surfboat back. I told you not to go in. -No you didn't, you motioned with your head for me to go in. And you know what? I almost died out there. -What did it feel like? Nothing, nothing at all. I wasn't even scared. We'll send him to swimming classes, right? Yes, he has to learn how to swim. Scene Two:. The Wall (Six Years Later) Enough already, stop it! What's going on? Enough already. Come on, everyone! Hey, Udi. Can you sing in Japanese? Shut up, Humi, you idiot. Screw you. -And in French? Yes, sure. But now it's in Serbian. -Serbian? -Yes, Serbian. Hey, Benny. How can you see the strings with those glasses? Shut up, who do you think you are? You bastard. Udi...! -Why do you stick up for that blind idiot? He's a tattle. He... -I told you to shut up, shithead. Right, enough. -Come over here! What's wrong with you? -Fuck him, what do you care? That's enough! What's going on here? Amiram! Zohar, go wake your Dad. Humi, sit down! What's he done to you? Udi, Udi...! Idiots. You're going into junior high, not elementary school. Act your age. Acting this way at your graduation party...! Some graduation party. -Udi, that's not funny. The party's over. -No! What... The party's over. Go to your sleeping bags Aw, come on. This isn't over, Udi. That was uncalled for. Come over here, Odelia. Come on, Zohar, Wake up your father. Hello? Hilik? Yes. Everything's fine. Yes. We're going to sleep. Yes. It was a nice party... Thank you. -Forget about it, it was nothing. I'll get him yet. But you know, I really can hardly see anymore. That's it, I'm going to be blind. You're not going to be blind or anything. It's dark now. I can hardly see anything either. It's too bad, the Serbian song could have been really nice. Did you see the way Odelia looked at me? -When? -When we sang. Isn't it a little stupid to sleep 100 meters from home? It's 100 for you, it's farther for me. No, don't come. I know it's only 2 minutes away. No, good night. I can't. I'm not going to kiss you over the phone, Hilik. I'll See you tomorrow? Okay, here's a kiss. Hello? Zorky, look. That car belongs to a Brigadier Colonel, if not higher. They must be conducting some kind of exercise here... The wall you see here is from the Crusader and Muslim periods. These are Roman sculptures and this is a Muslim garden. Now, imagine these ruins completed, a whole wall, as it was, a real wall, and imagine that these broken sculptures are whole too and picture them in all their glory. And now, what do you become? What is it you become? Artists! For just one moment, you become architects and sculptors. You become creators! See how good it feels to create even if its only in your imagination? Where's Humi? Zohar's gone too. Did anyone see Zohar? -Odelia's not here either. When did they disappear? They came with us, didn't they? Of course they did. Odelia was sitting here, right behind me. I'll go look for them. You stay here with the kids. I need two volunteers to come with me. You and you. Come with me. Zohar! Zorky! Did you know that Odelia's mother is dead? -No. Her father will lose it if we don't find her. How do you know her mother is dead? Guys, what's going on? Start looking. What are their names. -Humi and Odelia. Humi and Odelia. Okay, start shouting. Humi! Humi! Odelia! -Odelia! Zohar... Oh my God! Udi. Look, look over there. -Wow. Where? -There, over there. Look. -Wow! It's so big. What's so big? Its not big, it's huge. I think it's dead. -You think so? Maybe it's just sleeping. What are you doing? get away! We're lucky it didn't attack us. Why did you tease it? Did you see the size of it? It could have killed you in a second. It was just sleeping and we disturbed it. Let's move on. Zohar! Odelia! -Zohar! Odelia! -The car is still here. Zohar! Where are you running to? Wait, wait, I'll show you. Stop, there's a huge snake over there. Zohar, stop. There's a python there. -Where? In the trees, over there. -We just saw it. Don't move an inch. Stay where you are. I'll slap you in front of all your friends. Where did you go off to? -Why did you shoot, Dad? -What do you mean? there's a huge snake back there. Do you want it to bite you? You'd die on the spot. And you're no better, smart alecks. You know the whole class is looking for you? The officer and woman soldier are making out, going all the way. He's not even a Brigadier General. He's a Colonel. I saw his rank. -A Colonel? They get cars like that? Were they really making out? -You bet. The girl was already totally naked. Here they are. What happened? The 3 of them deserve to be slapped. -Yes, but what happened? What was that shot? -I fired my gun. There was a snake so I fired. -At the snake? -Not at the snake. It ran away. I fired in the air so they would stop and they did. Where's Udi? Udi didn't come back with you? I know where he is. Udi! And you didn't scare her? -She wasn't scared or anything. She just looked at me and blew me a kiss. How did you know where I was? -Odelia told us. She knew right away. Did you know Odelia's mother is dead? -No, how would I know that? Besides, what difference does it make? Now I know you fell in love with her. I knew it. Why, because her mother's dead? Don't be stupid. Wow, look how nice the wall is. Where are you going? Udi! Udi, what are you doing? Stop, enough of this, get down right now. Children, it's dangerous. Come down right now. These stones are very wide. Come see for yourself. -I don't care if it's wide. Get down. There's my house. -Sharon, what are you doing? Let's go up. -Don't you dare climb up there. You can see the school, too. Tirza, I can see our classroom. -Where? You see? -You can almost see the whole city. It's beautiful. Okay, enough. Get down. -Okay, come on, let's go. We're coming. Hey, a deer's horn. -Where? -Here, look. Nobody touch it. It's mine. Udi, what are you doing? -Hey, watch out. Udi! -He's crazy. Udi! Go back up and come down from the other side. Udi... -Now the other one's gone crazy too. What's his name? -Humi. -Humi, get back up there! I'm sending the two of you straight home... Okay, slowly. -Put your foot down, slowly. Put it there. Slowly, slowly. Hold on tight. Tight! Ambulance. Whoever has a mobile phone, call an ambulance. Reuma, get me some water. Humi.... Humi, talk to me. Humi. There's so much blood... There's no reception, I tried a few times. What do you mean, "no reception"? I used my mobile here yesterday. Whoever has a mobile, dial 911! Oh God! -Stop shooting already, Amiram. Just please stop. I'm firing for help. What are you getting so worked up about? We have two injured people here and I'm calling for help. There's nobody around here to call for help. Stop with the shooting and try your mobile again. Humi? Humi, talk to me. Humi, talk to me. Humi... Udi, are you all right? -Yes, I think so. Yes. My head hurts a bit. What were you doing up there? Why are you running around? Why are you shouting at him? Can't you see he can't move? You can't move? -No. Tirza, Tirza. -Yes? I got hold of them. The ambulance is on the way. -Thank God. Udi, can you hear me? -Of course I can hear you. When Humi started to fall you were trying to save him? Right? No, I fell and I grabbed his leg. How is he? It wasn't even a deer's horn, just some dried up vegetable. Pumpkin, I think. -Excuse me. Excuse me, what's going on here? Who fired those shots? I did, I fired them. Two kids fell off the wall and are seriously injured. Especially this one. Irit, come on. wake up! Bring my bag from the car, quickly. Right, these are just scratches. He'll be fine. Just scratches? -Yes. We have to check other things, an x-ray, maybe... he might have a concussion. I'm a doctor. I'm the Chief Medical Officer of the Southern Command. He suddenly fell asleep. Are you the teacher here? -Yes. -Please move the children back. Right Now. Get back. How many times do l have to tell you? This is the serious case. -Him? -Yes, very serious, yes. You see? Look. His bones are broken and they're pressing on his brain. I hope we'll be able to save him. So, isn't this heavenly? I don't know. I have no idea. I can't decide. Naomi, you come and try. Yes? This is Yehuda Goldstein, yes. What? When did this happen? Right, we're on our way. Udi cracked his skull. He's on his way to the hospital. Enough, Dina. Let's get there first. He's strong. I know it, I can feel it. What are you talking about, he's strong. He cracked his skull! At the hospital. Let me get out first. Wait in the car until I come back. -What? No way. So you can faint like you did with Granddad? You don't feel well in hospitals. You know that. I'm coming in, that's that. End of discussion. Mr. and Mrs. Goldstein? -Yes? -Nice to meet you, I'm Dr. Schiffer. I operated on your son. Come with me. -Don't we know you? Yes, you're the family that almost drowned in Ashkelon, aren't you? We were there with our girls. Why didn't they treat him in Ashkelon's Hospital? Why did they bring him here? We'll only know if the operation was a success when he wakes up, tomorrow morning, or maybe later on tonight. It's simple. If he moves his hands and legs and talks properly, that means everything's all right and nothing was damaged. Apparently, his head hit a boulder and received a blow. The bones in this part of the skull were broken causing a hemorrhage. In any case, our biggest concern was that this would put pressure on the brain tissue... Are you all right? -Yes, I'm fine. I'm a little dizzy, that's all. Then come and lie down for a bit. Rest. Come over here. He always gets sick in hospitals. -It's all right. I'll be all right in a minute. -Do you want to come and see him? Yes, of course I do. -Good. And you can rest here. You will be able to see him whenever you want, for as long as you want. But for now, no small children. Does he have any siblings? No, he doesn't. Dina. Dina, come back to tell me what's going on. Yehuda. Yehuda. Yehuda, get up. What happened Dina? Is anything wrong? Is Udi alright? -Nothing's happened How do you feel? I'm fine, why? -Can you get up? -Yes, why? Then come with me to see Udi, okay? He's sleeping, I saw him but I want you there with me. Udi. Udi. Wake up, Udi. We're here. Right here, next to you. Come sit down, Dina. Come. If he doesn't wake up, I'll... I'll die. I'm telling you, Yehuda, I'll die, just like that. Enough, Dina, don't talk like that. Enough. Mom. Yes, Udi? Yes, I'm right here. My head really hurts. Udi... How do you feel? -Okay, except for my head. Udi, sweetie, you're awake. Udi... Move your hands. Now your legs. -What? -Move them. Now talk. I am talking. what's wrong with you guys? -Udi... So when will they do the test? -ln about a month and a half. How's Humi? -I didn't ask and I don't know. Why are you so serious all of a sudden? What do you expect? It's Humi's fauIt that we're here. His mother even told all of Ashkelon that you pulled him. But it's true. -Udi, don't talk nonsense, okay? That's enough. And don't go around repeating that because it's not true. Look who I brought. -Benny, hi! -So nice of you to come, thank you. Come sit down. -What's the guitar for? Udi, how are you? -Okay. How do you feel? -Okay, just fine. I have to do an electroencephalogram next month. Did you ever hear such a long word? It really is. -Benny, did you? -Never. These are letters from the class. When they heard they weren't coming they all sat down to write something, Everyone wrote as much as they could. Why aren't they coming? -Because your going home in 2 or 3 days. It's silly for them to come all the way here, they'll see you at home. It's this new method they used when they operated on him. Let's leave them alone. -Yes. -Alright. Odelia went abroad. -To her mother. Her mother's not dead? -Of course not. She went with her parents to Washington, to the embassy. If you want, I have her address there. You were good friends, weren't you? -No, why? Not especially. Okay, I'll go out to your parents for a minute, I'll be right back. Tirza doesn't even know what happened. But my mother told me that Odelia's parents are divorced and she moved to Washington to live with her mother. And a few days ago I saw her father in the street and he looked a little crazy or drunk. But she really did leave. She even told me to give you her regards and a kiss. What in hell are you doing, you homo?! Tirza, there's really no need to apologize. You're a very good teacher and we never blamed you. Never, isn't that right, Yehuda? -Never, besides Udi really likes you. You could even say very much. I was so scared, so scared. You know, his friend, Benny, what a friendship. With Udi away, he's like a withered flower in class. Such good friends. Yes, they really have a special friendship. Yes. It's also a new method they've already used on people, whose eyes are even worse than mine. Is that even possible? -Sure, you jerk, and these people who had the surgery can see perfectly, without glasses, or anything. My mother even spoke to a specialist about it. We'll see, maybe next year. Don't think about Odelia. They'll be another 1000 like her. I'm not thinking about her at all. Hey, Benny, you know I almost died. And what did you feel? -Nothing. First there was this strong, white light and then it was like sleeping. You know what? Yesterday, I had a dream about the trip. I remember saying to myself in the dream, "l don't want this trip to ever end." Funny, isn't it? I mean, I cracked my skull on that trip. Why did you bring your guitar? My teacher taught me a song in Portuguese. -Portuguese? Enough, Benny. Let it go. Come on, give me the guitar. Would you like something to drink? -No thanks. -Sure? -Yes. It's no trouble, I'll just go to... -No, no. I can't believe it. That was the song at my wedding. I taught it to Udi. I like singing it myself. What a coincidence. I'm going back in, are you coming? -Yes. Come on. -Wait a minute, Yehuda. Wait. What, what's wrong? -I want to say something to you. What? Maybe we should have another child? Maybe we should try again? If you want to, Its okay with me. Are you sure you want to go through all of that again? All the treatments and everything? Yes. Scene Three:. Home (Two Years Later) It's Benny. Don't you remember him? He had surgery. He doesn't need glasses anymore What?! In English? Okay. Benny, I'm leaving. Bye. The surgery was a big success. They didn't even recognize you. What is this? Has Dr. Stein gone completely mad? Where's Sharon? She's at a funeral in Tel Aviv. Her grandfather died. Yigal Amir? Me? No, I don't want to. I do! I do! I want to be Yigal Amir. Leah Rabin? Are you crazy? Never! Here, look how nice this is. Here's the city, here's the sea. All you need to do is sit back with some watermelon and enjoy yourself. Come see the bedrooms. Dina, what a lovely apartment you bought. Yehuda... careful, Udi's sleeping. This is the children's bathroom. This is the baby's room. You haven't bought anything? -No, nothing yet. Superstition. The baby will be born in 2 months, and then, God willing... And this is Udi's room. He's sleeping. We're the surprise for your mother's birthday. Don't you remember us? I'm Mira and this is Ruthie. Turn the light off... -By the way, your house is very nice. -Beautiful. Oh, look what I brought. Wow! it's nice. do you want to change into it now? -Yes, why not? I want to look a bit more sexy. Hold this. Nice, isn't it? Where'd you get it? In Prague. Zip me up. -Wow. We're having a joint housewarming and 36th birthday party for Dina. which, for your information, is two times Chai, cheers. -Cheers. Thank you for coming. Ruthie was the only one I couldn't get hold of. I spoke to Mira but she's in Prague, so... I'm sorry, Dina. Now, if you want to see the belle of the ball in all her glory, Here, I prepared this in advance. What is it? -I don't know. That's Dina? -They're so cute. -And there's Ruthie Don't do that to me again, I almost passed out. Congratulations. Udi. Udi, what are you doing up at this hour? Go to bed. -I can't fall asleep with all this noise. Let him stay, leave him. Come here, Udi, Sit next to me. Mira's hot, isn't she? I wasn't even looking at her. Yeah, right... Don't even answer me, I don't want to hear it. You don't know who you're messing with. Believe me. I'll fuck you and your whole family up, you son of a bitch. You think that if you hang a note in the lobby then you can do whatever you want? What's all this noise on a Friday night? Stomping on the floor with your feet, what is this? -Who's stomping? Shut up, you piece of shit. Now go inside, and tell your friends to go home, or do you want me to tell them? I'm sorry, sir, this won't work, It just won't work with that tone of voice. Don't threaten us. I'll threaten you as much as I want. Who do you think you are? Get out of here, you ugly bitch. Hurry up and tell your friends to go home. -Hey, hey, hey! What hey, hey, hey? -Don't speak to my wife like that. She's pregnant. -I'll talk to her any way I want and you shut up! What you did here isn't right, I want you to know that. Come on, Yehuda, we have to go to sleep. It'll be okay, don't worry. How will it be okay? We bought an apartment above a criminal. Where are the pills? -The valium? -Yes. Up there, in the pink bag. I know who that neighbor is. -Who is he? He's Tuvia the lifeguard's older brother. So go talk to Tuvia, tell him to calm his brother down. He doesn't have to talk to anyone, it'll be alright. I'll take care of it, okay? Now come on, go to sleep. Udi, it's 3 o'clock in the morning. I invited Sharon. -To what? To see the house. I haven't seen it yet and you're already showing it to her? You can come too. -Right, and come between the two of you? I knew it, you've fallen in love with her, you're crazier than I thought. Falling for whoever has someone who dies. Idiot, her grandfather died, grandfathers always die. It's even nicer at night. Then all you need to do is to sit back with some watermelon and enjoy yourself. It really is a nice house. What floor is this? -The sixth. Come and see what a big living room we have. Isn't it big? This is the security room but we turned it into a walk-in closet. This is me and my sister's bathroom. Look. No, I don't want to. Where's your room? -Here it is. This is the bed, the guitar. This is for the TV, I'll have my own TV. These are my discs, and stereo system. And this is my sister's room. You didn't buy anything? -My parents don't want to before she's born. A kind of superstition. Come take a look, you can see the hospital from here. Maybe we can see my mother. She's there for tests. How do you know it's a sister, not a brother? -The ultrasound. Did you see it too? -No, they don't let kids in. You're a kid? -To them I am. Are you crazy? What are you doing? -Nothing. I want to kiss you. But why? What happened? I thought it was strange. Why did you invite me to your house? why are you so nice to me, telling me all kinds of things? You never used to notice me. -But you also... -I also what? So why'd you come here and go on about the apartment and my sister? I'm sorry... -So what if l asked about the apartment? Why shouldn't I be nice to you? Does that mean I want you to kiss me? No way. And what are you apologizing for? But I really mean it when I said I'm sorry, because... Hello, Sharon. How are you? -Fine, I was just leaving. A very nice house. -Thank you. Shouldn't you be lying down? We just got back from a slightly complicated test. I'll be right there. I'm going down with Sharon. -You don't have to come. Okay, bye. -Wait a minute. Where are those pills again? I'm so nervous, that exam stressed me out a little. You're stressed? What stress? Don't be ridiculous. It's because of the neighbor and you're totally exaggerating. Stop with the pills and bring me some water. Do you know, my mother wasn't even born when that happened? He's really gone nuts, I'm telling you. He's hooked on Rabin. What's going on here? Irving, please see me in my office after class. Udi, I need you to come with me for a minute. I'll talk to Benny. Okay, but you talk to his mother too. Okay, Dad. But I want to see Mom too. Fine. Bye. My Mom's in the hospital and my Dad has to stay with her. There's something wrong with the pregnancy. -Yes, your Dad told me. I can see the building, but not clearly. But trust me, I know every hallway and department inside. You were allowed to walk around? -I wasn't really sick or anything. Do you want to sleep here or in the living room? I can get a bed and mattress from the storage room. The living room is better, if that's okay. That way, I can watch TV a bit. Fine, I'll bring the bedding. Why did they decide to make you a brother only now? -A sister. I don't know. I think they had problems getting pregnant. It took over a year this time too. Okay, come on. "A bright, sunny day with no clouds, "My friends and l are going to the beach. "We took the car, the girls are already there, "When we reach the sea, we'll take out our surfboard. "Once again we're surfing, riding the waves "Here's another big wave, careful, don't fall. "From Bat Yam to Herzliya..." Quiet, you assholes! It's the downstairs neighbor. He always shouts when it's noisy. My father is really scared of him. -Why? Because he came here one time, screaming and yelling, don't ask. You know who he is? Tuvia's brother. -Really? -Yes, his older brother. You know what? Maybe I will sleep in your sister's room. Come in, come in. if you manage to wake him up, good for you. Go inside. Forget the pictures, Udi. Come on, go wake him up. He hasn't been feeling well since yesterday. Tuvia. Tuvia. You have guests. The furniture guy's son. Tuvia. Get up, it's 9 o'clock. We have to start working. What's wrong? I don't know what's wrong with me, I haven't been feeling well lately. Okay, I'm going in the water. I'll be back. It all begins at sea, the good and the bad, I'm telling you. So, guys... what can I do for you? Listen, Tuvia, could you maybe speak to your brother? We moved in above him and he's always shouting and threatening us. Okay, thank you very much. We're here until 7:00. Okay, thank you very much. -Thank you. So, what did he say? -I already told you four times. He said don't be afraid his brother isn't a criminal, he won't do anything. He just shouts and doesn't talk nicely sometimes. And that's it? -That's all he said? What did you expect him to say, that he'll come beat his brother up? Yes. -Stop it, Dad. What more do you want? He said he's not a criminal, he's not dangerous and he never hurt a fly. He said that too? -Yes. -Now you tell me? What, that he never hurt a fly? Okay, I'll tell you again, he never hurt a fly. That drunk again. It hasn't arrived, what can I do? Maybe tomorrow. But you already spoke to them yesterday. We don't have any beds to sleep on. You've got to understand. It's terrible on the floor, with just a mattress... with nothing. Listen, calm down, everything will be alright. It'll be alright, calm down, I'll take care of it. Here, I'll... I'll go call them again, you wait here. Just a minute. Yes. Right, we're on our way. They're releasing Mom. Come on, let's go get her. -Me too? Yes. I said 'let's go'. I need you to help me with her things. She has to rest, not carry anything, not move too much. Bed rest, that's what they told her. Listen... Yehuda. Yehuda. Yehuda, wake up. Something's wrong. What's wrong? Something's wrong, I can tell. You need to call an ambulance. I knew they shouldn't have released me. I'll call as soon as I know what's happening. If I can, I'll come back. Do you want me to call Benny's mother, do you want to go there? He can stay with us until you come back. I'm Sima, your downstairs neighbor. Baruch's wife. -Baruch? Don't worry, it'll be alright. Go with your wife. Fine. Is that okay, Udi? -It will be fine. -Thank you. It's okay, I can stay home on my own. This isn't the first time. Where's Baruch? -He's sleeping. Even if a train passed through the house he wouldn't wake up. So how did he wake up when we were singing and when my parents sang? He didn't wake up. He never fell asleep. I thought you were sleeping. -Sleeping? With all this noise? I hear you went to see my brother, Tuvia. He's nice, isn't he? Strong. -Yes, we went to see him. But he wasn't feeling well. -What do you mean, he's as strong as an ox. He was the strongest man in town. Only I could take him on. -Really? He told us it was the other way around. -So he said. He's my little brother. I love him. Okay, I have to go. I have school tomorrow. -Why? You can sleep here. Our daughter is in the army, her room is empty, it's okay. No thanks. I'll go upstairs. -Let him be, it's okay. If you need anything, we're here, okay? Don't hesitate. God willing it will all work out. Good night, pal. -Good night. Mr. Goldstein, you may go in. -Thank you. Hello Mr. Goldstein. I want to congratulate you. The baby is healthy but I must tell you, she is a little small. One and a half lbs. for her age that isn't a lot. But we've seen this before. Thank you very much. -Come with me. She'll have to stay here for at least two months, and I'll have to come every day, so our lives are going to change a bit. But what's important now is that she develops and that everything is okay. So how old is she? She is 29 weeks old but she's a little small for her age -Why? It doesn't matter, Udi. She's small and that's it, what's the difference? No, it's okay, Yehuda. It's okay. Look, Udi... what happened is, you know the baby is in water in the stomach, and for some unknown reason, the water started to disappear. And because this water is very, very essential to him, that is to her, they had to take her out. That's it. When can I see her? We don't know, they don't allow children in there. And I think they're right. Besides, I'd like you to wait a while, too. Okay, Udi? Wait until she grows a little. -But I want to see her. I don't care if she's small. Babies are always small. There is no reason to neglect your English studies and until Dr. Stein gets better, we will work together. Hello, Odelia. I'm sure you all remember Odelia from elementary school. Odelia has returned from Washington. They're our neighbors, well, her aunt is. They're staying with her. Her father came into our store, he was really drunk. Are you sure you know where we are? -Stop asking me that already. Enough. I told you a thousand times. I know very well where we are. Here, this is the elevator I told you about. And remember, if anyone asks, you're 16 and I'm your cousin. I think you have to go in here. Excuse me, can I help you? -His sister is here. He hasn't seen her and he wants to see her. How old are you? -16. -Almost 17. Who is he? -My cousin. Do your parents know you are here? -Yes. Look, The two of you are liars, and I'm doing something I'm not supposed to. But if you take gowns and go inside, you first and then you, I'll talk to the nurse. But be quick about it, look at her and come back out. Quickly. What's the family name? -Goldstein. Go inside, look at her. She's very cute. Excuse me, You have to leave now. The operation wasn't too successful. From far away it's okay, but close up... I've started seeing blurry. They'll operate again in the summer to fix it. Don't worry, you will be able to see perfectly. She's cute, isn't she? -Yes, very cute. A little small but you know what I saw? She has a birthmark here, on her head, right where you cracked yours. I only saw it when I put my glasses on. -Really? Oh, here's my mother. Come on, lets go. She could have made a career of it. She really could have. Even though no one who was with her ever did. Ruthie didn't, Mira didn't, not any of them. It's very hard to make it in show business. Does she have any regrets? That, I don't know. You know what? Why don't you ask her? Have you ever asked her? -What? -lf she ever regretted it. Yes, I did. But a long time ago. And what did she say? That she didn't. You love her, don't you? Yes, very much. I've always loved her. What about you? -I do too. But not like you. Prepare her for an x-ray. Look, as you can see we're doing everything we can. I think we'll be able to pull her out of it, but I suggest you call your husband, so you're not alone. Benny! Benny! He's taking a shower. You can come in. Hi, Odelia. What are you doing here? -I live here. Come over here, I can't talk to you like this. Come in, Udi. He'll be out in a minute. -Do you want to come over? I'll be there in a minute. -Come have something to eat with us. Maybe we should go to your house. We can't go to mine. My father is probably watching us through the blinds. Yes, he's there. -I knew it. Don't worry, he won't do anything. He's a real mess. He went nuts after my mother left him. So, do you want me to come over? -To my house? Yes, Benny told me you have a new place, that has a view of the whole city. Are your parents at home? -No, they're at the hospital. Wait a minute, I'll be right back. Please page Dr. Neeman. And she didn't weigh 1.5 lbs. She only weighed 1.1 lbs, and today she is a computer wiz, she plays the cello and she's huge. She could have played basketball too, if she had wanted to. But she doesn't want to. -So do you want me to show you around? Now? -Yes, why not? Come have a look, you can see the whole city from here. Oh... -A power failure. The whole city is out. I'll go get a flashlight. Udi? Udi? Odelia? Odelia? Where are you? -I'm over here. Where's 'here'? -I'm over here. Come. Is this where you sleep? -No, of course not. Benny slept over one night and it's been here ever since. Look how nice the hospital looks. Whenever there's a power failure the generators start to work. My parents are there now. So is my sister. This is her room. What... Wait a minute, don't turn around. Udi. Come here, Udi. I thought about you a lot when I was in Washington. Come over here. We can do whatever we want. -Odelia, what are you doing? What do you mean, what am I doing? I mean why did you get undressed? Odelia, put your clothes on. -Why? What's the matter, Udi? Why are you so scared? -I'm not scared, but... Look... -You think I don't know what I'm doing? Too bad. It's a pity you're such a child. That's all. Isn't that our neighbor? Yes, that's him. Baruch? What's the matter, Baruch? Why are you sitting here? My brother. They found him in his hut this afternoon, dead. A heart attack. Which brother? Tuvia? Yes. I was his only family. My wife, my daughters and me. He didn't have a family of his own. He was so big. So strong. and just like that... poof. What are you doing here? How is the baby? How is he? She. She just died. All her systems failed. It was too much for her. Come, come home with us. My car is here. Udi...
