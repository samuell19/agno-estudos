[fun upbeat music] [music fades] [phone ringing] [Taylor] I'm not home Aklia. [phone ringing] [answer machine beeps] Why do we go through this? Every time I tell you what's good for you start bugging. I know you there, pick up the phone. You're a control freak Aklia. You sit there messing with those damn cameras. Why my dumb ass talks to this machine. Ok fine, fine, but you need to get out of that apartment. I know your ass is home. I love you too Aklia. [phone ringing] [phone continues ringing] [answer machine beeps] Hey Taylor, it's Jake. I just want to say I am so glad that we met. I mean I hope you don't think that it is all business with me. -I really want to be friends. -Hmm. You know brother show business gotta keep some real people around. You know what I mean, my sister? I know what you mean my brother. So you, you just have fun, peace. Come on Candice how tired can you be? You just got back from Bermuda I'm the one two steps from a stroke. And hey look, it's my magazine which means they are my precious. Bullshit, it means George Winston Enterprises is under cover, 12 years of my blood, sweat and tears I've been here George. Baby I know, and look, I'll wine and dine you, I know I haven't been doing that lately. You haven't been doing much of anything lately. You know I'm not the passionate type, I never have been. Well that's the truest thing you've ever said, you don't even have any passion for Meridian. Well that's fine because when I'm gone-- Whoa, whoa, you won't leave? When I am gone, you will need some passion to screw some new into running this magazine. [hangs up] The only satisfaction I get these days. It's a great fall cover, but you really have to hurry. -Nicole, get my son on the phone-- -You don't have enough time, and besides, he's in production. Yeah, right, right. Alright. [indistinctive yelling] [Taylor] Work the eyes girls. Hey Sofia. A little more baby, put your chin down. Sofia, move something. Ok. Show them. Oh beautiful. Pose like a peacock. -Ohh. -[chuckles] Yes beautiful, fabulous, fabulous. She would give poses all over the book. [Taylor] A little attitude. Mmm, yeah, nice. A little pout. Chin down, just a little bit for me. -[Taylor] Hello Tammy. -Hello. [Taylor] How you doing? Give me a little more of those eyes, honey. Give me some love, beautiful. Yeah, that's beautiful. Gorgeous. Beautiful things. Beautiful. -[Taylor] Hello Tammy. -Hello darling. Eyes. A-ha. Gorgeous, a-ha. Yeah, ok that's it Tammy, a-ha, one more. Just like that, hold it. Yeah, beautiful. Ok ladies, take five? I shot that, the cover. What do you think? I published it. It's one of my favorites, it reminds me of my son. I love your work. How's the shoot going? It's going great. Do you mind? -[awkwardly chuckles] -Smile. Taylor James. -I'm-- -Candice Montgomery, yes I know, it's a pleasure. [sneezes] [Taylor] Bless you, should've got a snap of that. -[chuckles] -Please tell me you have some tissues? Um... No this isn't happening. Yes... It's happening. Here you go. Oh I can't use your scarf. Ok... [Candice] Yeah, yeah, I-I can, I'll buy you another one. Thank you. And they said chivalry was dead. I will buy you another scarf. And I'll take you to lunch, if you have time? Well, you're the boss. -Do I? -[Candice] Yes. -I'd enjoy that. -[Candice] Ok. [Candice] Thanks. Uh, bye. I am so sorry about that. You know this business, and it's drama. Ohh I know. I'm working with Miss drama queen. Now who could that be? Tammy put in quite show, didn't she? Yeah... She's good at that. She is a pretty girl. She's gone far. She'd be glad to hear you say so, but you know, we know her story, what's yours? [scoffs] I don't like-- Ok, let me guess, um... The brilliant editor of Meridian Magazine is here to tell us losers to just get it right. Damn right [chuckles] You know, I should just pass the hell out, from even sitting next to you. I um, I think that you've done a great job with Meridian. And I just wanted to say thank you. For all the work that you have given me. Well passing out is extreme. And you don't owe me thanks, I owe you one. Your work is great Taylor, it's some of the best I've ever seen. Thank you. You are welcome. Can I get you two anything else? Um no, just the cheque please. -Thank you have a nice evening. -Thank you. [Candice] Oh I hate these press jackets. I feel like an anchor has dropped on my neck, it's so tense it feels like stone. Damn, you are tense. I know a great masseuse, if you're interested! I may have to get that number. Look I got to run to this reception for the drama queens. Somebody's got to remind them to be beautiful inside as well as out. But please, stop by later and we'll have a drink, and then you can tell me how we can get some more photos of yours in the magazine. I'd love to stop by, where are you staying? Ooh, here let me give you the address. You know Candice, I will um, give you any photo you want. If you let me take some of yours. Candice, who reminds you that you're beautiful? Look I've got to go manufacture a smile for these people. Thank you again for the scarf. Candice, you are beautiful inside as well as out. And you're very much welcome for the scarf. Thank you, that was very sweet. -Let me take this. -Oh, I got it. Bye now. [phone ringing] Hello? [chuckles] Hey son. I wanted to call you before you left LA, but you were- I remembered you're in production. Yeah well... I really needed to hear from you today. [chuckles] Oh, hell as usual. Plenty to tell, as usual. Oh. So, any daughter in law potential happening anytime soon? Oh, she is? Well, does she think you're as wonderful as you do? Cause you know I do, but I'm your mother. [doorbell rings] Eh... I have a visitor. No, nothing like that. [chuckles] Well good, we'll have dinner when you're back in LA. Ok. I love you too baby. -Bye. -[doorbell rings] Just a minute. -Taylor. -[Taylor] Hi. I was wondering if you were going to make it. Oh I hope it's not too late? Are you kidding? Of course not. Come in. Oh um... This is uh, for you. Thank you. Oh wow [chuckles] Oh I love this shot. I love how you captured his face. I mean you can feel his spirit. I mean everything you shoot Taylor, you can feel the spirit. I'm just lucky I caught it. Yeah actually, that's my, you know I want people to be able to feel my work. You have uh, a very lovely place. Thanks. I enjoy it, when I'm here. Well please, sit down. Thank you. Oh... Nicki Tetovanie, I love her. She is definitely one of my favorites! So how long have you been into photography? Oh God. Since forever. When I was a child, I got a camera for my birthday, and I've been taking photos ever since. I took that camera everywhere. Everywhere? Everywhere, even to the bathroom. [chuckles] If I wasn't taking photos, I was telling bad jokes. You know anything to get people to smile. Oh God, and um... Here's a bad joke, ok... You ready? Um... There's a little boy names, Bequito, and Bequito has to pass this whore house, every time he goes to school, and there's this big fat horse sitting on the bastard, she's got herself wrapped up in a robe, and he passes by, and she says, 'hello Bequito, hello, hello little boy, hello little boy.' The kid sees her and runs to school. The next day he passes by, there she is again. 'Hello little boy, Hello little boy.' This goes on forever. Days and days and days. Once day Bequito passes by, and he's hoping she's not there. She's still there and she's standing there. 'Hello little boy, hello little boys.' Bequito gets a ball of nerves he says 'lady, lady, how come every time I pass by your house, you always go, 'hello little boy, hello little boy,' and she says it's because, 'you have such a small penis.' -[chuckles] -Bequito is completely offended, he runs off to school. Next day he passes by and there she is again. 'Hello little boy, hello little boy.' Bequito says... -'Hello lady.' -[chuckles] [laughing] It was bad, I told you, yeah. No it was good. You make me laugh as hard as my son. [chuckles] You have a baby? Oh that's right, you mentioned him earlier. Oh he's far from being a baby. I mean he's in his 20's. Ooh. You must make it very tough on his girlfriend. Oh you know... He does have a hard time keeping one. So... Tell me about your work. I mean you're very talented. You could do anything you want with your photography. Actually I have this assignment that I'm interested in, and I hope it works out for me. What assignment is that? Oh I don't want to bore you with my stuff. May I have some wine? Of course, I could've poured it sooner. Can I give you a hand with that? [Candice] I think I got it. Oh this is a lovely one. Please read it. Um... We are not lovers because of the love we make. But the love we have. We are not friends because of the laughs we spend... But the tears we save. I don't want to be near you, [both] With the thought it be shared... But for the words we never have to speak. I love poetry. So do I. -Tight. -That tightness. Oh my neck. You know you said- I can work on that if you like? I have a massage license. I got to study. Here, pour the wine. And I thought I was the Jack of all trades. Well it's pass bothering me. -You sure you don't mind? -I don't mind at all. Now I know you know everything there is to know about photography, but are you sure? You can really work this? Trust me, trust me. Ooh. It's a shame I don't get these more often. It's getting late [clears throat] I should go. Ok. Well uh... Thanks for stopping by. No problem. Bye. -Good night. -Good night. Relax, no, no, relax. I'll let myself out. -Ok. -Ok. Good night. Please answer the phone, George. Hello? George. -Wake up it's me. -What time is it? Candice it's two in the morning, what is it baby? What else would I want at two in the morning? Maybe some fingers running through my hair. You could jump on the first flight, baby. Oh that sounds so sexy honey, but you don't make booty calls over 3000 miles, in the middle of the night. Now come on, use your head. Uh, try me in the office tomorrow, I'll talk dirty to you. Dirty my ass George. [whispers] Dirty my ass. You really like showing off. [chuckling] Ok, look at me. Both nice. -Ow! -We can scale. -[laughs] -Makeup. -Take care of them. -Tyson when you're needy. It's a little shiny, get some powder. -How you feeling? -Ooh. Not too soon. Hi, nice suede. -So Taylor... -[Taylor] Tammy, the fact that I'm in a conversation with someone means nothing to you, huh? Oh I'm all with networking, but we're still on for dinner, right? How much do you have to ask me that today? Go finish getting your makeup done. Please. [Taylor] What? Nothing, you're a great photographer. And as a masseuse? How you feeling? -I feel alright. -Just alright? -Ok just hurt my feelings. -[chuckles] Don't be late for dinner alright, I hate waiting. [clears throat] [Taylor] You don't like your salad? [Tammy] You said for yourself, they're not hiring. I'd rather eat a cigarette. I mean I really do love the stuff, but that's gonna kill you. Well when you gotta go, you gotta go, huh? Eh. That was fabulous today, huh? Yes, you were quite lovely. That little guy though, you need to stop messing with him. [chuckles] -Nice. -[laughs] Why do you keep taking pictures of me? Because I want to see the real you, that I always hope I may find it. -Ok. -Yeah. Take this shot. -There you go. -Ok, alright. -There you go, get it girl, get it girl. -[chuckles] Good to have. Don't tell me what to do Taylor. Do not ever tell me what to do. Tammy if you've got something to say to me, sit down. -Alright. -Please. I do have something to say to you. Who do you think you are? No... Who do you think I am? I don't know. Do you? I mean cause you never really let me see. Because the fashion community has already established who I am, ok? Seventy five covers, and the grand-mama of them all baby, Vogue. V, O, G, U, E. Baby. What are you doing? Tammy, you know I loved you. See! Now you are pissing me off. The word love is coming out of your mouth, like a four letter word. You think you're always about to pass out, I'm about to pass the hell out. Who do you think you are talking to me like that, in front of that bitch today! You don't talk to me like that, nobody talks to me like that. I don't care, I am Tammy baby, the world loves me, they all love me. Look at them, look then! They love me, and nobody talks to me like that. -Especially no two bit photographer. -Ooh. God you used to be so beautiful, what happened-- I'm still beautiful, that's what I am, I'm beautiful. I will be beautiful until they burry me, that's what I am Taylor, I'm beautiful. If you were struck blind right now, you would still see how fine I am. And if you can't get with this beauty, like everyone else, I don't need you. Tammy you did not need me, it was because of your ass. [Tammy] Fuck you Taylor. I have Opera, Sally, Jesse, Revile, Heroldo, every fashion magazine in the world, kissing my ass. I don't need you or your lips. Yeah. You're tripping ok? If just for a moment, just for a moment, you were real with me. Don't talk to me about being real. You think... Candice Montgomery is real? You think she's real, you... You would, you of all people would-- More real than you are willing to be. And it's gonna be real funny when she breaks your heart. It's gonna be... I saw you all in her face, she's a smart woman, she can see through all of that. She can see through it all. Ok, eventually she's gonna get tired of some little photographer, you know what because you're not fabulous enough. In fact you're not fabulous enough for me. Thank you. The true spirt of the super model before me, huh? And the dreamer, who has all of a snowball's chance in hell of really getting what she wants. You know, you're beautiful. Stunning. -I'll give you that. -I know this. But I hope to God you keep up. As uh, you got it? I got nothing baby. Uh! Bad night, huh? Would you like some wine? Mm, thank you. Are you ok? Yeah, yeah. A prime time drama. You relate? My mommy always said, 'leave trash where you found it.' You're an artist. You make beauty, not trash. Yeah but your hands get a little dirty. -How's your neck? -Mmm. This sides good, it's the other side that's... A problem. Magic hands in the house. Sit down. No-one should feel this good. Everybody should. Especially you. What do you want from me Taylor. Why'd you come to me tonight? I dreamt of you last night. That's funny... I dreamt of you too. What'd you dream about? I was combing your hair. Strand by strand. When you say it like that, I also too. [chuckles] Yes. Just a fantasy. I dreamt about your hands. You really want to comb my hair. [Taylor] Candice. There's something so special about you. Why is it so hard for me to believe it anymore? [Taylor] You shouldn't need anyone to show you, but since you do... I want to. This doesn't happen Taylor. What's happening? Right now. If you want. Are you gonna kiss me? If you leave tomorrow... Mm, one kiss would be better. Are you coming on to me? Oh Aklia, she's so beautiful. Mm-hmm. How she look? How old is she? I mean can you give me some details here? Did ya'll do it? You don't ask me things like did ya'll do it? Ok, ok. Did ya'll um, get busy? -[chuckles] -Shut up. Ok, ok. Is she fine? Yes, Aklia, alright. Ok, cause if you're gonna be getting busy with her, shit then I guess she... She better be fine. How old is she? She's a litter, older... -Older, how much older? -I don't know, 40's maybe. Forty maybe? You know people lie, she's probably 60! -Common Aklia, listen-- -Oh, listen to what? Listen to you tell me a fabulous story about you and some old ass lady? You think that turns me on, or something? It's nasty, I don't wanna hear that. You don't understand, she's-she's perfect. She's beautiful, she's smart, amazing career, a wonderful son-- A son? She's got a baby too? No he's not a baby, he's grown, he's in his 20's. Damn girl, what are you doing? You're seeing an old ass lady, with an old ass son. You're about to go off to Africa for two years-- Stop America, and it's what I wanna do. God damn. What you wanna do is just tone it down a little bit. You make me scream at you, God you have to run everything. Yes I do! When my friend is bugging out, trying to screw mother Teresa, running off to fuck where... The parade has got to stop, Taylor. When you leave, will you close the door after you, please. Oh it's like that now. You gonna screw little granny over there in Bolivia and kick your homie to the curb. Oh Aklia would you go, please before I pass out. You know what... You pass out. Pass the fuck on out, there get it. When are you leaving for your trip? Day after tomorrow. Hey Candice baby, good morning. Oh girl, you missed a party last night a Billboard live. It was the bomb. Quincey was there, the whole Vibe crew, Keenan even came. And check this, I am loving the new cover. Check it out, how the babies looking up at mama, that's nice. George did you pick up the cheque from gunsight? I'm sorry, what's that? The cheque from gunsight, they've been waiting personally for you to pick up. Oh I had someone else do that for me, yeah they took care of it. George they have been waiting to speak to you. That was the only thing you had to do all week. It's cool, they took care of it. George. Listen, I have realized that I have no made one decision, that concerns Candice, and Candice's wellbeing in 12 years. And I've got to consider moving on. [George] Well look, don't talk like that, I understand how you feel, -but we've been so busy lately-- -No! No! I have been busy lately. You do not know what busy is. You don't know what the pressure is, and you definitely don't know what passion is George. Passion? Oh so that's what this is about? You just want to stop the presence to make love? Get out George. We'll talk about this tonight. I'm tired Taylor. Have you ever been... Unsure of something, yet so sure at the same time? Have you ever felt like this? I've never felt like this before, Candice. What's wrong? I'm just tired, I'm tired Taylor. I've been married to this magazine and George for the past 12 years. Even though George never married me. And I feel like... I'm knocking on a homeless man's door asking for a million dollars. You know George doesn't even know my birthday. His secretary buys my gifts. And I've been his right leg for 12 years. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You don't have to stay. Oh. He won't let me go. He'd die if I leave. Maybe you dent want to do this anymore. People change you know. I don't even know who I am anymore. I mean for the past 12 years I've been in this relationship. And I can't blame George, I haven't had any passion for ten of them. Maybe you need to find out what Candice wants. You're too beautiful to be so sad. Well it's easy when people don't love you and don't understand you. Everybody loves you. That's why they pressure you. Maybe they don't understand you because you hold back what you really feel. And I see you. And I love what I see. Well then nobody's loved me like you do. I just love you in my way. And I would do it every day if you let me. Come and go away with me. I can't go away and go away with you where? The day after tomorrow I leave for a photo assignment. Photographing children all over south America. Argentina, Rico, Brazil. Come with me. What. I-I can't go. And neither can you. Candice. What do you want? I want to feel like Candice, I want to feel like the woman who use to write short stories and poetry, -and who laughed. -You know what I want? I wanna make you happy. -Let me. -I'm scared, Taylor. I was scared too. Why didn't you tell me you were leaving, before this? I was afraid um... That you wouldn't let me... Know the woman I feel in love with, the moment I saw her face... So for the very first time I feel love and you're running? Don't let me go alone. [scoffs] [laughs] The world doesn't allow this type of love to happen to anyone. It's happening right now. But the magazine. George. -My son... -Candice. George, the magazine, doesn't sound like what you want, anymore. And... Your son's grown. I have to go Taylor. I-I have to go... Candice. Don't run. Unless it's far away and I am at your side. Please don't leave me like this. I need time to think. [sighs] Shit. You guys I can't play anymore. -Why not? -Yeah, how come? Taylor and I are on the outs. -Oh. -And to top that, she's in love. -With someone I haven't even met. -Mm. And she's leaving the country. For like two years in like two days. [Wendy] My God. Taylor's leaving the country with someone you don't even know for two year? Is she crazy? Do you even listen when people talk? -Hmm? -[Aklia] Huh Wendy? [Aklia] Just tell me are you crazy? I said she's leaving the country and she's in love. I didn't say anything about the old ass lady going with her. Did you just day woman? Oh come on Ruthy. You had to know Taylor was gay, It's obvious the way she flirts. Well I was just playing it off because I didn't want to tell your business. What do you mean my business? Ok Ruth. Calm down ok, let's not talk about anyone's business, because your business wins over them all. Don't let me speak it. Ooh, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy. Is it time for the whole world to know about your secret fantasies, and needs, and wants and desires, for Miss Taylor James? Talk about something being so obvious. I didn't think so. Oh so I see we're on my closet dreams now, ok, well um... Should I pull Aklia out of your closet? Yeah that's right, I mean since she's here and everything. I think now is the perfect time to let Aklia know how many times you couldn't sleep, because you had to kiss her picture. You know what Wendy? I'm getting real sick of you, you- I'm just sick and tired-- It's ok Ruth, it's ok. Because I'm sick of you too. It is so obvious that you are a frustrated lesbo. And you're just mad at me because I don't want you. Oh, it's all go now. -What! -It's all good girl. Don't even flatter yourself miss thing. You always think someone wants your tight ass. If I did want a woman, it wouldn't be you. You know what? Let me tell both of you something-- -Right. -Excuse me! I'm upset here. My friend since knee high is leaving the country and we're not even speaking. And you two weirdo's are going back and forth about this nonsense. You just need to get together. You deserve one another and while you're at it, just leave, please. Oh are you-- You know Aklia, you're a little edgy. -Right. Just leave. -Didn't your mama... I can't take it anymore, just bye! But you're cute when you know. Can you guys call me later? I'm just saying this, she sounds like an incredible lady. And I'm just mad that I couldn't steal your heart. But you know if I was in your position, I would probably be heart broken also. I just don't like seeing you and your little toes, -being so sad on your last-- -Stop! Day, it's your last day. I know. I know, but wait, I have to take the job right? Yeah, I mean, get your money on. But I gotta follow my heart too, right? Well, she does know how much you love her. -She does know that. -She knows. I can feel it. That's deep. She is so lucky. She's one lucky lady. What would you do Jake? Look if I leave tomorrow... I may never talk to her again. Well If I were you, what I'd do... These came for you. I guess Mr. Winston is trying to come clean. Um, that's all Nicole, thank you. Close the door please. [Taylor] I side line as a travel agent, as well. Smile. Just thought I'd offer you half my wing for you to fly free. By the way I just thought I'd let you know, you're buried in my mind, and my heart and my soul. I'm complete when I think of you. You're in my life forever. If only in my dreams. You're something wonderful. I try to keep a smile on for you, even when I'm sad. Smile for me. I'm so happy we met. If only you were free. Never the less, you are loved. Your door was open so I just let myself in. I have been thinking of you ever since I left. I didn't think I'd ever see you again. Now you'll wake up to me every morning. I'm coming with you. -What? -I'm coming with you. Oh shit. -Aklia. -Ooh. Hey, no, no it's cool, um. I want you to meet someone. -Candice. -Hi. -It's my best friend Aklia. -Nice to meet you. You don't look that old to me. -I'll be right back ok? -[chuckles] -I want to introduce you to two of my favorite people, Aklia-- -Mom? Son? Ooh damn. [R&B music] [music fades]
