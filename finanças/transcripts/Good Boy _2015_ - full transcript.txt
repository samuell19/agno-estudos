So, one day we were in a convoy. It had been restationed about an hour in front line, hitted an ied, a bunch of trucks... totalled. We were being fired on I thought I was dead. I mean, I thought i would die. Oh, I didn't see my life. Saw Eli's, his childhood, me, that day. Then it was like I went to where he was, at that very moment He was in Hawaii It was just a normal day, maybe it was his day off. He was in this tiny house on this big piece of land. I could see the ocean out the window. He was just waking up. Somebody was making breakfast, maybe his boyfriend. I don't know. I could smell everything, coffee, food, the ocean. I just watched them. He was waking up. I... I was dying I was dying and he would never know. I actually bought a ticket to Hawaii - About ready champs? We got a long drive. - Yeah. See you around, man. - Why would you... - Stop it. Listen to me. You'd regret it, Macon. You would. Our life would be gone. You're a good man, Macon. You made a mistake, but you're a good man. I need you to believe me. I need you to hear me when I say it. Everything's gonna be okay
