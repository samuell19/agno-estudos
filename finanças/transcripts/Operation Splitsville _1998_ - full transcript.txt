[music playing] [bubbling sound] [train whistle] [alarm bell] James, are you up? I'm up. [music playing] Chris, up and at 'em, tiger. First day of school. [sniffs] Oh. [laughs] James, what are you doing in there? Nothing, mom. Let's get going. James, slow down. Here, at least wait until I study the Heimlich maneuver. Well, Chris is waiting. Oh, that's right. Let's see, what has it been? Two Whole weeks. Chris, honey, slow down. So Ray at the market said, I don't know how they can afford a new Lexus when they can't even settle their grocery bill. People will not take responsible. Careful, little pictures, big ears. Dude. Dude. How was Vegas? Have I got something to tell you. I saw on TV that they have this giant tower-- Hey, guys. And a roller coaster that goes around the top like 3,000 feet up and they strap you in. Hey you dweeb who was there? You or me? Oh, yeah. Tell me what? That wasn't even the coolest thing. Hey, Chris. The coolest thing was-- Hey, Chris, back from Vegas? No, I'm still there, duh, Ernie. It's cool, huh? When we went there was this roller coaster-- Would you guys shut up about the stupid roller coaster-- - Hey, Chris-- - I did something much cooler. Hey, guys, wait up. Great, wait for Walter. Ah, he's OK. Anyways, you'll freak. The coolest thing was-- Hey, Chris, were you on vacation? [groans] Toll bridge, pay a quarter or go the long way. I half a candy bar. Go inside, small fry. Mom, said you got stop calling me that. OK, medium fry. First one over the bridge wins. Watch out, man. I'm right behind you. Go inside, small fries. Tell us more. Details. Wait till we get everybody, OK. We need to know. What's up? In Vegas, I did it. Oh. What? What did you do? With the girl? No, Ernie, what do you think? OK, sorry. Go on, go on. So one night I snuck down to the Strip. The Strip. Wow. A strip club, like with naked girls. So I turned around, and I see her. And? [school bell rings] Ah, man. [music playing] [whistling] You look hot, Elise. But didn't your parents freak. My dad's even the mayor. And he's pretty much clueless. I could have walked out in my PJs. Her parents split up over the summer. How do you know? My mom heard it from the guy at the farmer's market. He said her mom ran off with a golf teacher. Poor Elise. Mom and Dad would never do that. My dad said only lamers get divorced. Your dad said lamers? He said people should stay together for life. Like wolves and pigeons. And goldfish. Good morning, grade five. My name is Mr. Roberts. But you can call me Kenneth. You know why? Because that's my name. Here's a lamer. You may not know this, but your teacher last year, Mrs. Roberts, is my wife. So I know all about you. So what's your name? Me, Arthur. Ah, so you're Arthur. [knocking] Excuse me. This is Tommy Davis. Hi. See that he knows. Knows what? About me and Mrs. Roberts last year. What about you and Mrs. Roberts. [sighs] No way. Yes way. Total love. You never saw the way she looked at me at recess? And how she always gave me the good crayons? I'm talking the big fat ones. Yeah. Wow. And you and her-- I mean, the two of you-- No, we never got the chance. It was summer vacation. She must have told him about us. Oh, man, you are so busted. You'll be in the fifth grade your whole life. Well, welcome. You ready to meet your classmates? - Sure. - OK. People, this is your new classmate, just moved here from Chicago, Tommy Davis. No, Maddox. Davis is my stepmom's name. Oh, your dad's name is Maddox. No, that's my mom's name. Oh. My first dad's name was McAlester. But when they got divorced, my mom took her old name back. Oh, when she married Mr. Davis, you kept the name. So-- No, she married Mr. Stewart. - Who married Mr. Davis? - Nobody. That's my stepmom's name before she married my first dad. My mom married Mr. Stewart. But he lives in Brainerd, Minnesota. So I came over here to live with my stepmom and my first dad. Last the way we became the Brady Bunch. Quiet. Quiet. Thank you, Tommy. Why don't you go find you seat over there. This seats taken. OK. It's the first day of school. Let's ease into it by taking out a piece of paper. That kid's a operator. And writing about what you did over your summer vacation. [groaning] Come on, come on, what did she look like? How old was she? Did she have big-- you know? - Blonde, 16, really big. - Whoa What was her name? Ingrid. Then what? Then we did it. Did what? Did what? Come on, details. Hey, you guys, what did he do? Ernie, tell your brother get lost. That's not fair. I want to hear. Nobody ever tells me stuff. He had sex. Now get lost. Come on, Billy. You're too little. You can't hear this. I want to know about sex. I'm telling mom. - Wait. OK. OK. Sex is-- - Yeah. - It's-- It's a guy and a girl when they do something together. Do something like what? They share something beautiful and sweet together. - Like cake? - Like cake. Like a jelly doughnut. OK, we told you. So go. Dopey kid. Cakes. It's some sort of seed, right? And it comes out. Out of your nuts. How does it get out of your nut? They kind you just crack open. Yuck. Oh, my gosh, I feel like I got to puke. Because that's my name. You see, that's just what they did too. How do you do it? I mean, they talk to you, really talk. They look at me like my spaceship just landed. You're standing in front of a blackboard. I'm out running around the soccer field, getting sweaty and dirty, just like them. There's a bit of a difference. You think that's it? Soccer. I have never gotten that game. I mean, no offense, I know they love it in Europe. That's not-- By the way, my wife wants me to ask you something. She's got this cousin, Debbie. And she's single. No way. No way. No, no, no, no, this one, I think you'd really like her. She's a very interesting woman. She has a collection of snow globes from all over the world. I think someone wants to talk to you. You want to talk to Mr. Roberts, right? I'd better excuse myself. See you later, Ken. You think about it. Yeah, right. Arthur. I think we need to talk Mr. Roberts, man to man. OK. I just want you to know, nothing happened between me and your wife. - Oh, good. - There wasn't time. Oh, really? No. And I didn't want anybody to get hurt. You know? That's very nice of you. No problem. Well, thank you for telling me. You're OK with this? Yeah. Are you? Yeah. [music playing] There's the newbie with a lot of names. And 62 parents. Louise the squeeze missed the bus. Go tell her Madonna called and she wants her boots back. No, you. I dare you. OK, I double dare you. OK. James wants to tell you something. Go on, James. What's the matter. You wuss. Hey, what's going on? What did you do. Nothing. That's just the effect he has one women. Give her some breathing room. What's the matter, Louise. Some weeks I go to my dad's house, and some weeks I go to my mom's. Oh that's got to be hard. But when school started, they were switching, because my mom gets home earlier. But my dad didn't want to do that. And I forgot where I was supposed to go. Divorced junk. Typical. Look, you stay right here. And I'll give your folks a call. James, you're in charge. Hey, Louise, is that a tamaugachi you have? What's his name? - Hi, honey. - Hi. - You ready to go? - Just a sec. I have something to sort out. These parents, poor kids don't know which way is up. Daddy. Hi. Here's my girl. Have your bag? Yeah. Sweetie would you Daddy a forever? Sure. Hey, Louise, you know how to remember which parent to go with? What's your dad's name? Raymond. OK, great. On the days you're going to your dad's house, wear your tamaugachi on your right hand, R, Raymond, right, see? Then you remember all day. Thanks. What's your name again? Tommy. Oh, what a hottie. Wow. Here, it's energy. It has the most caffeine. You can't be sad and hyper. Um-- hi. Hi. James, let's go. How clumsy are? You going to hang out with the girls all day? Get your thumb out of your butt. Language, Christopher. Hi, Mrs. Roberts. All straightened out. No problem. You're going to your dad's. And we'll give you a ride. OK? All right, thanks. Let's go. Come on, honey. Come on, James. Oh, man, I never should have let her go. [music playing] Hi. What's your name? Can I help you? Hi, Mrs. Clark. Hi, James. Come on in. I'm sure James is up in his room. Oh, man. What? The moon is out. No. Let me see. Oh, wow. I'm in love. Come on, man. Give it back. Wait, wait, a minute. What's that? What? What do you see? I don't know. I think that's Ernie. What? Gimme. That's Ernie's house. What's he looking at? [humming] Mom? Mom, close the window. Turn of the light. Put something on. My God, Chris, what's the matter. Just-- just-- just-- just-- put something on. Chris, I can't wear clothes in the shower. It doesn't work like that. Whoa. Come on. OK, be careful. You've got him? I think so. - OK, no, right there. - OK, Yeah, yeah, yeah. Got him. That's fine. He's going to miss his parents. Yeah but if he stayed in there, they'd eat him. That's terrible. That's nature. CHRIS: Come on, James. Come on over. Hi, Chris. Come on. Hold on, I'll be right there. MOM: Dinner's in 15. He's too old enough to understand. OK, you know what? This is so unfair. Let's not do this to him. - This is crazy. - Shh All right, vanilla pudding, my favorite. James, your mother and I need to talk to you about something. Am I in trouble? No, no, no, sweetie, we just-- we just want to talk to you. We didn't want to mess up your vacation. But your mother and I've been discussing a lot of things. And we've decided to live apart for a while. Yeah. Now this doesn't change our relationship with you, James. We still love you, very, very much. It's important to know that. Mom is still mom. Dad is still dad. We'll just have our own places. You can come visit me whenever you want. Hey, you know, it's was kind of like TV. Families don't always get along. Yeah. They always get back together at the end. [music playing] MOM: If I'm not here for any reason, leave the keys in the car. DAD: Tell James I'll call him. [music playing] [engine starts] [music playing] [sobbing] [birds chirping] Hey, James. What was up with your dad last night? Huh? I saw him packing the car. Is he going somewhere? Yeah. Antarctica. What? You know that ozone hole they have? Well, NASA's been trying to fix that. And they need an engineer to go up in a special plane and stuff. Get out of town. Your dad, wow. Hey, there's Ernie. Huh? Weren't you going to bust him up for, you know, your mom, knockers. Hey, Ernie. I told you I didn't see your mom. Yeah, well I saw you. You think a stupid cap hid your stupid face? [school bell rings] I wasn't looking at your mom. I bet your dad will be on news, huh? I don't think so. It's kind of a secret. And you told me? Thanks, man. Anyone have the math assignment. I fall asleep watching MTV. And I totally blew it off. OK, everybody, let's hand in the math assignment. Anyone have the math assignment. Sam, would you collect them? Sure. Relax. Just watch. Mr. Roberts, sorry, it's none of my business, but you know Louise's folks split up. I think she had a tough time at home. And she's worried because she didn't get her math done. All right, Tommy, thank you. OK, Thank you. Louise, you can turn in the assignment tomorrow, OK? Oh, man. What a scam. Just cause her parents blew it, she gets special treatment. Give me a break. There you go. Thank you. Uh, oh, you're back. OK, little guy, what's your pleasure? What would you like? I have donuts, cheesecake, candy, chewing gun, chocolate chip cookies. No. What's the matter? Can't make up your mind? Would you like me to do it for you? They call it the government. All they do is give people money who don't deserve it and stick their noses into people's private affairs. [car door shuts] Looks like someone didn't quite make it to the Antarctic. And she's no Eskimo. No Eskimos in the Arctic. Let me get the camera. Well, she doesn't kiss like an Eskimo either. Honey. Well, just in case the divorce gets ugly. Marian, Stay out of this. She's just as bad as he is. I knew something was going on over there. Chris, James didn't say a word about this to you? No. Well if you can't tell your best friend, what kind of friend is he? Morning, guys. Morning, coach. All right, which one of you is going to be most valuable player this year? Right here. Last year it was James. The year before Chris. But you all have the same chance. Just do your best this year. Yeah. What? Yes, coach. All right, warm up. Individual drills. Let's go. James, come on. Don't let it go out. Come on, keep it alive. Liar. Huh? Hey, what happened? Try to get up. You OK? Oh, it's a charlie horse, James. I know it hurts like a son of a gun, but you'll be OK. Just sit it out. OK? Yeah Hey, guys. Come on, play. Good. Good one. I can help that. Here, feel that? Muscle relaxing? Yeah. Wow. My second step dad was a hockey player. He showed me how to do this. He was always racking himself up. How many stepparents do you have? Hm, well, let me put it this way, we could have a basketball team. When you parents separate, does it get to you? Sure. But it's like everything else. You get used to it. Last time I was the one that suggested it to my mom. Really? The guy was a shrink. You know what they say about shrinks, right? Nice guy, but totally bananas. We were all better off. So what about you? Who left, your mom or your dad? Who told you? Did Chris say something? Yeah, like he would tell me anything. No, I just noticed. I mean, you're Chris's big body. Now you're not. You're like zombie man in class. And you're asking me about this stuff. Think anybody else knows? Nah, only a pro notices this stuff. [music playing] Hey, James. How's your leg? It's getting better. Do you know why your folks divorced the first time? At first, I thought it was because of me. Really? You did? It's called a guilt complex. 70% of kids get it after their folks split up. Wow. After a while, I realized my mom like blue eyes. My dad had brown eyes. Sometimes it's as stupid as that. My dad's the one who walked out. And my mom's bummed all time. He's such a jerk. How old is he? 39. Ah coming up on the big 4-0. Midlife crisis. 68% of men freak out when they hit that age. I care. He's still a jerk. Mom cries at night. Yeah, that's normal. She's still in stage 1, abandonment. You mean, there's more? It's OK. It gets better. See, right now her self-esteem is history. Her whole world is gone. Except for you. So what do I do? Self-esteem stuff. Tell her she looks nice all the time. Bring your breakfast in bed. Breakfast in bed is going to fix this? Any time now she'll hit stage 2, freedom. She'll hook up with old friends, get a new job, or take classes and stuff. 71% of women do. You really think so. Just wait and see. It's statistically. [rock music in distance] Yeah, I remember. No, you wouldn't believe it. He is ten. I know, scary. I don't know how my son keeps getting older, and I still say the same. Uh, huh, yeah here he is. Hello, Marcia. Hello. Yeah. He's great. OK, I'll speak to you soon. Take care. That was my girlfriend from College. I think I'm going to take an art class with her. Oh, I haven't done this i so long. I miss it. I miss it. It looks really pretty. Thanks. You think so? You look nice today, Mom. James, thank you, sweetie. Come here. That was sweet. Come on. [music playing] Happy Valentine's Day, Mom. Oh, honey, thank you. Oh, that is so sweet. Guess what? Stage 2. All right. Listen, stage 2 doesn't last forever either. You're in for some ups and downs. Really? Oh, yeah, it's a roller coaster. I mean, there'll be a lot of ups and downs. Hey, Tommy, I told Joey what you said about birthdays. His first one's coming since his folks split up. What about birthdays? Ah, man, the two great divorce paydays, birthdays and Christmas. Come on, tell us. - We did it. - Did what? Sex. You know when you get together with a woman-- Yeah, yeah. And you have something sweet together like donuts and cake. Ooh, I like cake. That's not sex. - Yes, it is. - Is not. - Is to. - Is not. OK, what is then? Like some kind of dance. You don't know. Well, neither do you. Yes, I do. I'll show you. My parents acted like such dorks after they split. Well, my friends act like dorks and they're still together. Way to go, James. Hey, Karen you want to sit over here? Listen, guys, yeah, divorce is a drag, but you can work it. Want to know? Yeah. OK, the big G, guilt, you might feel it, but your parents feel it big time. Why is this important to know? Because if you work it right, it will lead to the other big G-- gifts. Isn't this cool? Rad. TOMMY [VOICEOVER]: They'll spend big bucks to make you feel better. Especially, if they can one up the other. You know those little annoying rules around the house, like a bedtime? If you play it right, you can watch a midnight movie every night. I've had all these problems at home. It's OK. TOMMY [VOICEOVER]: A little sob story about problems at home can really help you get ahead in the lunchroom and in a classroom. Bridge is closed. Come on, Chris. Quit messing around. I've got to get home and get my book report done. What do you care? You don't have to do anything. Just tell the teacher your folks broke up. Why don't you shut up Make me, you liar. Ew, dog turds. Ew, sick. [laughing] Got him good. No, that's not true. Dan, no, I would love to see a movie. Yes. As long as there's no aliens or car chases. No, that leaves plenty of options. Yeah, and you can choose the restaurant too. Wait up you guys. What's his problem? He stole a bunch of my mom's text books out of the house. He's giving sex lessons. Sign me up for sure. You guys are so weird. Is it the battery or the electrical? What's happening. Can't get it to work. My showtime is in two minutes. Thanks, Max. OK, quiet down, everybody. Now it being Earth Day today, we have a special presentation on the endangered Amazon rain forest. Now, to make it a little more real, I've included some pictures I shot myself on a trip to Peru, oh, 100 years ago. Lights, please. Here I am in a Aquitos, on the edge of the mighty Amazon River. Next picture. OK, smart guy, show us. After you pay a quarter each. MR ROBERTS: A region of great wonders, some never seen by the eyes of man. The woman. MR ROBERTS: To quote space lore, this is the final frontier. Next picture, please. Setting out up the Amazon. Now I admit to being a bit nervous at this moment. Not too sure about what I was going to encounter. Oh, please, hold your questions till after. Next picture, please. Now here's a picture with appeal. Thank you. Next picture, please. The fiercest creature on the river, the deadly crocodile. Actually, interestingly, they are considered edible by the natives. Next picture, please. KID: That's James's dad. Who did this. Lights. [laughing] What was that all about? Nothing. He's getting a hard time because his folks are splitting up. Oh, I'm sorry, James. It doesn't matter. Why did you tell him? Because you can't keep being ashamed. It's not your fault, they broke up. I told you there was going to be ups and downs. This won't be the last. I'm just sick of it. The first year is the worst. It's statistical. Your folks will pull you back and forth. You'll live here and there. When the kids keep the house and the parents have to come visit, that will be a great leap forward. In the meantime, you just have to hang on. And don't blow off people who want to help. Yeah. Your dad having fun in the Antarctic? Sure looks like. Was that picture from your house? What if it was? Hey, look everyone there's a fight. [music playing] Come on, get up. You broke my tooth. Way to go. One for us. No way, you fought girls. And we kicked your butt. Just wait till recess. Quiet, everyone. He broke my tooth. Serves you right. Karen, would you wait outside, please. Let me take a look at it. Don't touch it. Your hands are dirty. Can I use the restroom, please. Yeah, go ahead. [music playing] Were you following me? No. I mean, yes. You were very brave out there. Are you brave? Yes. Owe. No, it's OK. Good boy. Yes, the dentist will fix it up so you'd never know what happened. What is it? Keep still. It's all right. Can I have the rest? Mm. Come here. Holy moly. Wow. Billy rocks. James, James, fighting? Breaking Chris's tooth, what were you thinking? I didn't do it. Oh, so that means that Chris's parents and your teachers were lying? - Yeah, whatever. - Whatever? I hate it when you say whatever. Come here. Let me see your lip. Oh, look at that. What kind of a mother does that make me look like? And what's your father going to think? He picks you up for your first weekend, and it looks like you got hit by a truck. Why do you care what he thinks? It matters. It matters. Listen, James, I have to be able to rely on you. OK? Hey, you're the man of the house now. Well, then who's Dan? What? Did you have nice time at the movies with him? He's just a friend from school. [horn honking] Oh, there's your dad. We'll talk about this later. Not fair. Not fair. You're going to look good. Oh, my God. What do you think? Something, huh? Ready to ride, James? - What? Are you out of your mind on this death trap? Come on, Bernice. it's perfectly safe. Don't be such an old fudd. Listen, if you want to relive your adolescents, do it by yourself. My son is not getting on this machine. He's my son too. Well, I would think you'd be more concerned for his safety then. - I am. That's why I got him my helmet and he's going to ride with me. This is ridiculous, walking here with the $10,000 Harley sitting in the driveway. Still, it's pretty rad, huh? Yeah. Look, James, I know it's kind of impractical, but heck with it. You only live once. Size nine and-- Size five. I'm going to get the ball. Thank you. So, James, how's it going. Everything good in school? Did they pick soccer MVP yet? Not yet. Well, it's either you or Chris. Either way, it's good for you guys, right. What happened to your lip. Hit by softball. Hey, James. Hey, Tommy's here. Dad, this is Tommy from school. Nice to meet you, Mr. Calloway. Hey, dude, slap me five. Too slow, take a blow. All right, you guys, go get some drinks. I'll give you some money. I need make a call to the rental car company. OK. Your dad's pretty cool. He's acting dweeby. He and my mom got into an argument. It happens. He's acting all hip and young, like he's in some Pepsi commercial. TOMMY: It happens. It's the dad version of stage 2. Ta da. My clubhouse. Pretty nice, huh? Thought you hated TV. Yeah, but this is like the movies. You'll think the Terminator is right in the room with you. And check this out, ta da, again, everything is exactly the same at Dad's and Mom's. You will feel at home at either place. Now it's exactly the same. I don't see anything. Where is she? You have to wait. Hey, look. That's not fair. I'm going. Hey, champ. You didn't seem to have a very good time? It's OK. No, no, we're going to do better next time. And you'll get to ride that Harley. I promise. OK. OK? Bye, Dad. Bye, bye. James, it's Chris and those guys. They got Ernie. - Ah, come on. Let's go. Leave him alone. What's you're problem, Chris? You are. You started this in the schoolyard. And now we're going to finish it. We're sick and tired of you losers getting away with everything just because your parents split up. My parents even say you're bad influences. Yeah, your parents say lot of things. Some day they might even be right. From now on it's war. Divorced dweebs stick with their own kind. And jerk weeds stick with theirs. Oh, look it's the kid with 62 parents. That's what you called him, right James? I'd rather have 62 parents than two jerky ones. What do you know, midget? You don't even have a dad. You're a little bastard. Let me go. I know kung fu. You want war? You've got it. And traitors get not mercy. Get lost, butt brain. What's a bastard? It's like a spice. Like mustard. Why did he call me a spice. This is totally weird. I'm going to tell my parents. Leave your parents out of this. That's right. Parents are no use. It's just about us. TOMMY: This meeting is now in session. War, like it or not, we got it. So what do we do? Roll over and take it just because we're divorced kids? No. You guys know what divorced means? It means we've got to stand up for ourselves. Yeah. OK, then, we hereby form the Loyal Order of Divorce. First order of business, a war chess. Man, I didn't know there were so many of us. Wait a minute. Karen isn't a divorced kid. Her folks are married. Who cares, Louise? And what about Ernie and Billy? You guys just have a mom. That's not the same. But that's not fair. We can't be with the married kids either. So? That doesn't matter. This has to be just for divorced kids. Otherwise what's the point? She's right. It's got to be just us. [music playing] You turkeys, our mom has more boyfriends than any of yours. Sorry, James, war is hell. OK, let me get this on you here. There we go. My God, Billy, you're getting a little pot on you. What have you been eating? Nothing. Nothing my eye. OK, from now on, you have got to cut out sweets. No more chocolate or donuts, OK? No. My mom says I'm getting chubby. Well, you are kind of. It's not my fault. It's all the sex. It makes you fat. Well, my uncle must have sex all the time. That's why women get fat before they have babies. Babies? What does that have to do with sex. That's what sex is for, to have babies. I don't want to have a baby, He'll to take all my toys. [music playing] Hi. Hi. Hi. Babysitting, sorry. Just go stay where I can see you. Sorry about the club. It's stupid. Being divorced doesn't make me so different. Well, no, but it makes you feel different. You know, kind of left out. I mean, now we have something to belong to. And I'm left out. Sorry. Here. That's not a real diamond. Jessica, go. It's beautiful. It's just like Romeo and Juliet, on opposite sides. You can't tell your side you're in love with me. Are you in love with me? Sure, of course. [music playing] Ernie, why are you sitting there? To-- uh-- see better. Why is everyone moved around? OK, that's it. No more moving seats. Now, Louise, please come up here and complete these problems. [cheers] Quiet. What is that for? This is not a spectator sport. Think this is humorous, Walter? Why don't you come up here and complete these problems? [cheering] What is that? What is going on? Well, this is it. Last practice before I name most valuable player. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on, guys. Energy, energy. [music playing] [whistle blows] What are you doing? Guys? What is this? Soccer or mud wrestling? Soccer. It doesn't look like it. OK, that's it. Practice is over. James, Chris, over here. Good work, Ernie. Can't believe it. What's going on, guys? You are the key players on the team. The others look up to you. And now you won't even pass to each other. What is this all about? You two fighting? Huh? Team means we stick up for each other no matter what. I want both of you to think about that. And while you think about it, give me 10 laps. Come on. Come on. Excuse me, coach. I guess my mind isn't really on the game because my parents are getting divorced. I'm sorry about that James. I know that must be hard. But do you think that that's a good reason for you to let your teammates down? To let yourself down? No, not really. Then go out there and give me those laps with your teammate. You're hooked up with Karen. None of your beeswax. Love her forever? Going to get married? So what if we do. Here's what. You're going to mess her up. Shut up. It's true. Kids whose parents get divorced always get divorced themselves. That's baloney. It's a fact. You're going to make Karen feel just how your dad made your mom feel. I am not. Sorry, it's statistical. CHRIS: Look, I have no other friends a lot. And, well, I don't want anyone to get hurt, including you, So I think that we should break up. But why? We're fine. I mean-- [music playing] Is it true? Kids whose parents get divorced wind up getting divorced themselves? Well, yeah, that's what the statistics say. Man You can't let it bother you. [music playing] It's a mess. Oh, man. Those creeps. Look what they did. It's not fair. There's just too many of them. We didn't do it. Who's there? Come out. It's just us. What do you want? We want to join you guys. We have more fun with you all than Chris and wait-for-me Walter. But your folks aren't divorced? Who cares? We're getting our butt kicked here. We could use the help. No way. This is our club. Louise is right. We win or lose this ourselves. No one else. But we want in. Whatever we have to do to join we'll do it. What? You'll get your parents divorced? Sure. I was just kidding. No. Wait. If that's what they want, maybe it's better for some of them. Wait a minute. That's really mean. It doesn't have to be. Like Sam, his folks are always fighting. He hates it. Maybe they'd be happier divorced. [ahem] Oh, sorry Sam. No, it's true. Well, if it were better. And he's not the only one. There's lots of people who would be better off split up. Let's do it. Prepare to launch Operation Splitsville. [cheers] One, two, three, Splitsville. Is that him? Yeah, that's Sam's dad. Sam says he comes here every two weeks. OK, do you know your line? OK, how do you know that? How do you know that? No, no, how do you know that? OK, OK, it's not the Gettysburg Address. Come on. So anyway, they say his dad spends all his time buying new clothes and getting haircuts instead of looking for work. How do you know that? Sam's mom told everyone at the beauty salon. My mom was there. Hey, we're not done. I've got to talk to my wife. Is that Leo's dad? Yeah, here he comes. We're meeting the Peterson's at 6:00. Oh, sorry. Excuse me, ma'am. Your husband missed this one. Thank you. I'll make sure he gets it when he gets home. All right, family, start up your taste buds. Dad's super shishkebabs are on the way. Well, it better not be too spicy. You know my stomach. Yes, I do, Marlene. You tell me that all the time. Well, I mean it all the time. Um-- uh-- Dad? Yeah, what is it, honey? Um-- I-- you know-- I-- uh-- I Forget You forget? What did you forget? What was it, sweetheart? - Nothing. - Did you see something? - No. Oh, honey, you still got something wait. He's forgetting a lot. I know, Alzheimer's. [choking] Water! All right, all right. What's the matter with you, moron. [beep] WOMAN [ON VOICEMAIL]: Hey, sweet cakes, had a fun time the other night? Looking forward to seeing You Kissy, kissy, see you soon. [laughing] Here you. Thank you, very much, sir. Here's yours. [music playing] Who was that? You're sister is cute. Half-sister. and all business. Come on, get out. How could you go kissing someone in the middle of the afternoon? I told you I didn't know who she was. Of course you know who she was. She came out of nowhere. I'm supposed to believe that? I don't believe that for a minute. Suckers, we got them good. OK, status report on Operation Splitsville. Sam says his folks aren't speaking. [cheers] And Leo's mom made his dad sleep on the couch. All right. Arthur says his mom and dad won't eat each other's cooking. They bought a pizza five times this week. Three new members on the way. Operation Splitsville. MR ROBERTS: What's going on here? Your my inside woman. I need some inside information. I may be a teacher, but I'm not entirely clueless. Half the fifth grade won't talk to the other half. And none of them will talk to me. What's going on out there? I don't know. I'm in fourth grade. MRS ROBERTS: Kenneth, just leave her alone. It's OK for you, you don't have the Cold War raging in your classroom. Well, Karen can't help you. You're just going to have to take care of your own class. What does that mean? What are you trying to say? Oh, honestly. You never cease to amaze me. Mom? What does smug mean? Smug, um-- self-satisfied, thinking that you're better than everyone else. Kind of like gloating. Why? Oh, nothing, just something I heard Dad say. Really. Mm, hm. MRS ROBERTS: I'm smug am I? MR ROBERTS: What? [music playing] Hi. Hi. I have a nice time, but I'm getting fat and I don't want a baby. I'm sorry, a baby? I'm too young. So this is-- goodbye. I'll never forget you even when I'm eight. [school bell rings] James you've always been an excellent student. But this year your grades have slipped badly. Well, Mr. Roberts, there's been a lot of trouble at home, divorcing. Yeah, I understand, but your grades are your grades. And you are in real danger of not passing this year. Kenneth, I'm ready to go home whenever you are. Fine. Just a sec. Bottom line, everything I said about that test next week goes double for you. OK? OK. I'm just saying I'm ready. I don't want to sound smug. Not that again with the smug. I still don't know what you're talking about. Really? You don't? No, tell me. What are you talking about? Nothing, forget it. Hi. Hi. What's up with your parents? Are they arguing? Yeah, a lot. Bye, James, excuse me. I'll be in the club soon, you know, Operations Splitsville. MRS ROBERTS: Look where you're parked. MR ROBERTS: I didn't realize. And we can get back together. What is she doing. MR ROBERTS: Do you have to have everything in the front seat? MRS ROBERTS: Oh, give me a break. [whistle blows] Give me your glasses. Here it is, the day you've all been waiting for, the big announcement, the final verdict. I've been watching you all very carefully. And I've made my decision. This year's most valuable player is-- It will be Chris. No, no, it'll James. Ernie. What? He sucks. But he's the worst player on the team. Wrong. He's the only player on the team. I don't know what the rest of you are doing, not passing, tripping, fighting. But Ernie is the only one among you still playing soccer. And that makes him the MVP. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Coach, can I talk to you. It's no use pleading, James. I made my choice. I know. I have another question. OK, shoot. There's a lot of statistics in sports, huh? You mean like kicking distances, RBI, stuff like that? Yeah, all that stuff. It must work, right? I mean, otherwise who would bother figure them out. You're losing me, James. What are you asking? Just that if statistics say something, you should believe it, right? No. No? No. Statistically you should be Chinese. Huh? Look, over 60% of the people in the world are Asian. Therefore, statistically most people are Asian. You are a person, so-- they're just numbers, James. When you get ready to take a penalty, no number tells what you are thinking or feeling. Statistics only know what happened last time. This time, that's up to you. Thanks, coach. Don't thank me. Start playing with your team again. TOMMY: We are here to mark this momentous occasion. Samuel Banks, do you wish to join in this noble assembly? Uh, huh. I mean, yes. And are you qualified to serve in our ranks? Yes my dad moved out last night. Then I dub thee a fully qualified member of the Loyal Order of Divorce, ready to join us in our fight against the non-divorced. [music playing] [water bubbling] Owe. Sorry. Why didn't you just ring the doorbell? Uh-- I don't know. Look I'm sorry. I didn't really mean to break up. Then how come you did? Well, I guess because I listened to something really dumb someone told me. This whole war thing is dumb. Well, I liked the club when it was just us talking about stuff. I mean, now it's kind of weird. So you don't mean to join? I don't want you to make your parents breakup. It's not fun. I know. [sneezing] Oh, no. Hey, are we having a meeting tonight? No, everyone is getting ready for the test. Tommy says we should put the war on hold till after the test. Then we'll knock them out. Hey, Sam. We'll have a meeting next week or something. It's OK. I don't care about that war stuff so much. I just wanted to hang out or something. You OK. Yeah, just-- What? Like Sunday, the car races were on, Formula One. Yeah. And me and my dad used to watch them all the time. He let me used to watch to time the laps. But didn't your dad always argue with your mom all that time? Yes, now she fights with us instead. I kind of miss him. I got to go. Excuse me. Karen, listen, you can't let your parents split up. We got to do something. Well, what are we going to do? I'll think of something. KAREN: No, you goof, my mom wouldn't call him Mr. Roberts. JAMES: Oh, yeah, so what do they call each other when they're, you know, mushy? I don't know, pookey. Pookey, I don't want to fight. Meet me at Case Luna at 6:00. Oh, good. I know Mrs. Roberts is in the meeting, but can I leave a message from her husband? Meet him at Case Luna at 6:00. Thank you. Oh, and don't worry about Karen. She has a sitter. Bye. Thank you. A sitter. [music playing] [singing in spanish] Two, please. MR ROBERTS: Hi, honey. Hi. Oh, they kissed. Oh, romantic. God, this place. A lot of memories for us. Oh, yeah, there are. I'm just glad you came to your senses, Estelle. That's cute. My senses. Well, you invited me here. And-- What are you talking about? You sent me a little note. What note? Kenneth, if this is some kind of joke, I don't think it's very funny. You called me Pookey. Pookey. Believe me, there's a lot of things I'd like to call you. And Pookey is not one of them. Forget it, let's just go home. Oh, mayday, mayday. I didn't like this place anyway. Look, it's coach. Hi, cousin. What a coincidence. Isn't this funny? Yeah. Would you like to join us? No. No. We were just going. We're absolutely stuffed. Have you ordered yet? See you later. [school bell ringing] This is it, test day. Clear your desks. Where's Sam? Does anyone know? Is he sick today? [music playing] Oh, little bird. You folks leave you? Well, you don't need them. OK, begin. [knocking] I'll be right back. Mr. Roberts, these are the Banks. That's Sam's mom and dad. You're right. Let me ask the kids. Just a minute. All right, stop working. This is very important. Sam has not been home since yesterday. If any of you know where he is you have to tell me. I promise he won't be punished. You understand this is very serious. We're all concerned for Sam's safety. This is our fault. We got him into this because of the stupid war. Sam did what he wanted to do, James. We didn't do anything. I knew something was wrong with him yesterday. I've got to find him. What? Are you crazy? James, wait. OK, everybody everything's OK. Mr. Roberts, he's going to help look for Sam. And I'm going to help him by watching you take your test. So all eyes on your papers. Let's go. Do your best. [music playing] Look at the ball. Anticipate my move. Yes, very good. There's a problem. What now? Sam Banks is missing. OK, that's it. Go on in. - His folks say-- - Good work. He didn't come home last night. Did they call police? Oh, yeah they've been out all morning. I should've known there was a problem. You would have. You give me too much credit. I'm a soccer coach. I can't read their minds. Help me out here. Sam's parents just split up. I think he took it pretty hard. Now, you're a kid, you're angry at the world. What would you do? What about that clubhouse? Huh? They didn't check the clubhouse? What clubhouse? Let's go. [music playing] JAMES: Sam? Sam, are you here? Where'd you go? [music playing] Please hurry. What if he's hurt? Don't worry. Sam's a good kid. He won't do anything stupid. [music playing] Sam. Sam. Where's the famous clubhouse? It's got to be around here somewhere. Sam. Sam. Sam. [music playing] Hey, how did you get up here? Hi, James. Wouldn't it be cool to fly, James? I dreamt about it. My mom and dad were down there yelling at me. And then they got smaller and smaller till they weren't there any more. Yeah, that's cool all right. But that's just in dreams. I know. You see that? Yeah. Come on. [music playing] I left my jacket in the clubhouse. Let's go get it. Over here. MR ROBERTS: I got him. Sam, oh, Sam, oh, baby. Sam. I'm glad you're back. I don't want to let you go. [knocking] [splashing] The fish! The fish! [yelling] I got him. I got him. Give him a pencil. Get him a test. All right, everybody, emergency is over. The fish is fine. See. Get back to work. Did somebody move? No, ma'am. OK. Kids, you'll be happy to know that Sam has been found. And he's back with his mom and dad. He's fine. Don't be so modest, Ken. Your class should know. Mr. Roberts is the one who found Sam. All right, now let's get back to work. OK, time's up. Pass your tests forward. I'm dead. You didn't get to do any of it? I didn't even hand it in. I don't think he'll give us points for writing out name on it. That that's. Well, maybe not. I'll see later. Hi, there. Hi. Tony, here he comes. Throw it. Oop, almost. Hey, Mr. Roberts, go long. [music playing] Got it. You OK, Mr. Roberts? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. We got all the test for you. Thank you. All right, let's try that again. Here's your pen. See you tomorrow. Yes. [knocking] Hi. Hi. Well, I have something to tell you. I'm going to have to go away for a little while. I know. You do. I saw you get your showcase. Yeah, well, I have to go to Denver for this teaching conference, and I think I'm going to be gone from-- - What? Thursday to-- But I thought you were-- What? I thought you were getting divorced. Divorced? Well, you and dad were arguing so much. Oh, honey, well, sure we argue. I mean people do sometimes. But your dad and I love each other an awful lot. I'm sorry you thought that. KAREN: Guess what? My parents aren't getting divorced. My mom just had a conference in Denver. They're not? No, so they were just arguing. So we were totally clueless. That's great. What's great? Karen's aren't getting a divorce. That's their choice. And that's not all. You know that test? I got one from my dad and I filled it all out and put it in the file for you. You what? Oh, no. What? I did the same thing. Now there are two test with your name on it. Great. So now just not only flunk, I get busted for cheating. OK, let's not panic here. All we have to do is-- uh-- sneak into the classroom and take away the extra tests. Yeah, right. Yeah, my dad's not finished grading them yet. OK, we've only got a couple of minutes. So let's-- No, no. Don't help me any more. Thank you very much. I'll do this one myself. [music playing] James, can I help you find something? James, Mr. Roberts would like to speak with you. Come on in, James. You know our attitude towards cheating. It cuts against everything we try to do here. It's one of the most serious offenses a student can commit. Now this is what's going to happen. The two false tests will be thrown out. And I'll be having a little talk with Tommy and my daughter. See teachers, even the slower ones, get to recognize their students handwriting. It wasn't really their fault. And now to you. You will stay after school today and take a makeup test. And you can count on the questions being different. That's-- that's all? Would you prefer electrocution? Well, no, sir. But why? Well, because one of your classmates broke the sacred kid vow of silence and told me what happened on the day of the test and what you did for Sam. Oh. OK. That's it. Just be ready for that test at the end of the day. Thank you, Mr. Roberts. Who told you? Sorry, there's a teacher vow of silence too. [music playing] Hey, wake up, sleepy head. Come on, you don't want to be late for your first day at the big school. No way. Come on. Getting big. [music playing] Yes I understand that. But I have a schedule too. Look, let's just talk about it later, OK? Your father is driving me crazy. He's got a meeting on Friday and he can't pick you up until 6:00. But he knows very well that I have a class that night. Ah, well, I got an idea. I could go to school with you, hang out at the snack bar, and he could pick me up there. That would work. That would work. That's great. Thank you. Oh, you are so my son right now. I'm telling you, divorce can be the greatest thing that ever happened to you. Hey, Tommy. Oh, hey, James. It's all here in my newsletter. Guys ready for the big time? Yeah. No more baby school. Whoops, sorry, Karen. It's OK, Ernie. I'll see you guys next year. And I'll see you after school. Sure. Kind of neat to be taking a bus, huh? Nah, I kind of miss the old bridge. Me too. Billy, I saved you a jelly donut. No way. I'm sick of sex. [music playing]
