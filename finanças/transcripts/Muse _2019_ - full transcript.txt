In all the years that I've been your literary agent, this is the first time you've ever missed a deadline. Twenty two best selling crime thrillers and murder mysteries and now you've hit the wall. I know you've suffered writers block in the past, but you've always come through it. And I know that it's been a terrible year, it's been hard on you, I can't imagine. We'd been divorced ten years, Richard. Plus, you know, I've had time to get used to it. Three years, she battled it. Gilda. Strong woman. I liked her. Fierce cow. You know after twenty years of being together, we really didn't like each other all that much at the end but we loved each other. You know what I mean? Plus, she gave me Ethel, my princess. She idolizes you. She's my world. Look, about the book, I don't know what to tell you. Give me a few weeks, a month maybe? I mean, it's all up here, I mean, you know how I work, I just, this time I just can't seem to get it out. Take your time. But you know how this business works, I have to give the partners something. Just write it down on the back of a napkin and I'll get Tiffany to type it up. I just need to get in the right frame of mind. It's not easy, you know. Why don't you, why don't you go to your place in France, blow away the cobwebs? I don't think Ethel's ready for that. She hasn't been there since we were last there with Gilda. She can cope for a couple of weeks on her own. I mean, I can always pop round and you know, make sure that she's okay. You call me if you need me Harry, I'm only a phone call away. Thank you, you know I appreciate it. The great Detective Rawle. How may I be of service? Can I get you a drink? Sit down, Harry. I'm so sorry to have to tell you this. I insisted on being the one to come here and inform you myself. It's about Ethel that I'm here to talk to you about. Ethel? Why, what's the matter with Ethel? Oh, I see. I have this friend back in I.A, Dennis, he's an ex cop. 24 years he put in. Deathograms, that's what he used to call this. This is what he calls it, this is what you're doing, right? Like I said, I had to be the one to come here and tell you. I had to be, I couldn't ask anyone else. What happened, David? She was involved in a car accident a couple of hours ago. She was pronounced she was pronounced dead at the scene. I'm really sorry, Harry. I'm so, so sorry, mate. It's never easy, things like this, you know? What happened? She was crossing the road when she was hit by a car. The driver, he said he didn't stand a chance of stopping in time, she just stepped right out in front of him. I want to see her, I need to see her. Yeah, of course, of course, yeah. I'll drive you myself. Is there someone you want me to call... No, no. No, there's no-one else. Just me now. Just me. Harry, I just don't know what to say to you. There's nothing you can say. There's nothing anyone can say. I just want to help you to get through this. We want to help you to get through this. I keep having this nightmare. I have the same nightmare, every night ever since she... My beautiful princess, my darling and she's, she's lying there in the mortuary, all alone. She's cold and she's alone. No-one there to tuck her in, no-one there to kiss her goodnight. Look, about... The book? I can't even think about that right now. My mind, the thoughts are going through there at a hundred miles an hour. No, of course. The partners have already agreed to delay the launch, to put back the press junket and all that. But this might be a good time to To what? Well, the agency was wondering, you know, if well, to be very frank, if you would reconsider the offer to start on your memoirs. With your fan base, Harry, it would fly off the shelves. I don't know, I don't know if this is a good time to be starting anything. Well, I just wanted you to think about that. It might help, be like therapy, a catharsis. With everything that's happened, you know, the emotions are so raw, but the first thing, the most important thing is you, Harry, you're a friend first. I'll be fine from here, je marche d'où je suis. Daddy. Louie? Come on boy, Louie? Louie! Louie, here! Louie! Louie, come on. Come on! Excuse me. Can I help you? Oh, I'm sorry, we were looking for our dog, Louie, have you seen him, he's a King Charles. No, I haven't, probably because this is private property. What's your name? I'm Sarah, and this is my sister, Eloise. I am so sorry, we're staying next door for a few weeks. Our dog got in here a couple of times but we didn't realize anyone was living here. Hang on, you're him, aren't you? The author. Well, our dad, he's a writer too, he's read all your stuff. Dead Man Walking, Fifteen... You have to excuse me, I have to get back. I hope you find your dog. The main entrance is back that way, you can see yourselves out. Please see to it that you do. Hey, you're the man from next door. Harry, yeah, right. Right, hello. Eloise, that man from next door's here. What can I get for you? You work here? I'm just helping out, my dad knows the owners, so. Oh, right, yes. Uh, well I'll have a glass of red wine, please. Thank you, Eloise. I wanted to thank you. I wanted to thank you for the food. Well, a man can't live on red wine alone. Well, I've done all right so far. And I wanted to apologize for the dog. Look, we got off on the wrong foot. It's fine. I just hope that you ate. I did, oh I ate, yes. I really appreciate it, you didn't have to do that. Well, I'm glad. Look, um, you don't have a pool at yours, do you? No. Well, if it's okay with your parents, you're welcome to come over and have a swim in mine any time. What's so funny? We kind of already did when we didn't realize that anyone was living there. Obviously, we wouldn't have if we had known. That's okay, the offer still stands. Can we? We'll ask Dad. Maybe tomorrow? Thank you. Mr Williams, please. Yes, I'll hold. Richard, Richard, it's Harry. Good, yeah, good, how about you? Oh, it's coming along nicely, the first chapter anyway. Much easier to think down here. Yeah, okay, all right. Sure. Yeah, okay. Right, take care. Right, bye. Daddy? Daddy? God, I love it down here. You've been before? Last year, yeah. It's a very special place. So, what do you want to do with your life, Eloise? Me? Let me guess. An actress. Well yeah, but probably not what you're thinking. Musical theater. Good for you. I mean, it's hard work. Sometimes I just, I think the odds are just stacked against me. Youth is wasted on the young. Have you heard that? My dad says it all the time. Well, there's always someone worse off, Eloise. You talk about defying odds, a very good friend of mine, a fellow author, about five years ago, he had it all going on. And then he had some crazy obsessed with him. I mean, we're talking Play Misty For Me meets Fatal Attraction. Long story short, a nut with a crush completely screwed him, sold some fake story to the tabloids and this is in England, mind you, where they lap that shit up. They have it for breakfast on their crumpets. What happened to him? Well, you know, he got on with his life, he wrote another book. One day, you know, everyone thought he was a great guy and then he woke up and realized his name and reputation meant nothing. Not that that was relevant to him, it didn't mean anything. I mean, he made the decision that getting another book published being so much more harder, this new founded situation, wasn't a reason to give up on it. He thought that if people eventually thought he wasn't such a bad guy after all well then, great. But that's nothing that he had any control over. And he reminded himself daily that if that ever became his aim he'd be fighting a losing battle. Where is he now? Well, we talk every now and then on the, you know, the email. Sorry, I'm old fashioned. Every book I ever wrote, I wrote it on my trusty rusty. Anyway, I digress. Defying the odds. Trying to make people think better of you that don't like you just keeps them in your life, Eloise, and you know what that means. That brings them back into your life in your life, your life, Eloise, is too short and too precious to waste on that. My dad said something similar but in fewer words. What expression does your father have? If they don't like it, fuck 'em! I think he would probably summarize it better himself now too. How so? Well, he would say to anyone who said no, you can't do it, you're not good enough, it can't be done, he'd simply say don't get in my way. But after, when it's all said and done, I mean, when everything is just, you know, you could be the best actress, your father could be the best author, I could be the best artist, anybody can be the best whatever the hell they want to be. When it's all said and done, you're only going to be asked one thing when you get up there. Were you good to your kids? What are you writing? My memoirs. This one's not fiction? Looks like it's coming along nicely. Remarkably. For the first draft. It's all about finding your muse. Sante. Sante. Goodnight, Harry Newman. Ethel! Ethel! Ethel! Ethel! Ethel! Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Harry. Harry. Ethel. No, Harry, it's Eloise. Harry. It's Eloise. Ethel. You've had a bump on your head, Harry. How long have you been out here for? Come on, come on, let's try get you up. Come on. Easy, easy. Easy. Why don't you take a seat in the drawing room? Harry, you might need to see a doctor. I'll live to see another day. Just sit down, I'll make us some coffee. Are you sure? You can barely stand, you're holding on to the wall. Yeah, no, I think I'm, I just need to walk around a little bit, get the blood circulating again. Trust an old man, will you? Go ahead, go and sit down, I can get things started. I'll be there in a few minutes. Okay, if you're sure. I'm sure. I've been through worse. Okay. Here we go. Thank you. How are you feeling? I'll be okay. I wanna thank you for well, you know. What was you doing up a ladder, for goodness sake? I was just, uh, there was this ribbon, it was stuck in the tree. I don't know how it got there. It was bothering me. It shouldn't have been there, it wasn't supposed to be there. She... Hey, hey. You okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. It's just my, just my head, you know. I'll be fine. Harry, I'm sorry you're hurting. Thank you. No, I mean, I'm sorry you're hurting. My dad, he read about it. About what happened. No parent should ever have to bury a child. You're an old soul, aren't you? You miss her, don't you? So much. I'll see her again one day. She was a dancer, a singer. Just like you. She got it from her mother. What a woman! She did it all; Broadway, West End, you name it. I've never known anyone who's, anyone who's died. What do you think it's like? One minute you're there, then nothing. After, there's nothing. Oh Harry, I'm sorry, he must have gotten out again. I hope that gets better. I'll be back tomorrow to check on you, okay? Harry, Harry, it's me. Now, don't forget that I'm gonna be on my way back from that meeting in Avignon tomorrow morning. And well, I just thought that I'd pop by, and see if the old place is still standing up. Look, we can do lunch in the village. Well, it's good to hear. Well, it's finished. At least the first two chapters. Hot off the press. Yeah, well this is all new to me, this self-portrait but uh, yeah, yes, good. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye. Daddy. ♪ I see you ♪ ♪ For there is no-one else but you ♪ ♪ To make me feel this way ♪ ♪ Can you remain with me ♪ ♪ Through the times ahead ♪ ♪ Can you detect sadness in my heart ♪ ♪ When you leave me for a day ♪ ♪ Into the light shines from your heart ♪ ♪ I'd walk through the night ♪ ♪ To see we don't part ♪ ♪ Rain leaves my soul ♪ Daddy! There you are! Ethel! You're here. I couldn't sleep. The wolves are fighting again. No, I mean you're here. Oh shush. Come. Come sit with me. What are you listening to? Some of your old records. Do you remember this one? You and Mom used to... I remember. Oh, Ethel. My princess. I love you so much. So very much. I'm so sorry to have to tell you this. I insisted on being the one to come here and inform you myself. It's about Ethel that I'm here to talk to you about. Ethel? Why, what's the matter with Ethel, what? Oh, I see. I have this friend back in I.A, Dennis, he's an ex cop. 24 years he put in. Deathograms, that's what he used to call this, this is what he called it, this is what you do, right? Like I said, I had to be the one to come here and tell you. I had to be, I couldn't ask anyone else. What happened, David? She was involved in a car accident a couple of hours ago. She was pronounced, she was pronounced dead at the scene. Bonjour. Bonjour. The girl, Eloise? Monsieur? There was a young girl here the other day. Blonde, young? Eloise? Eloise? Yes, Eloise. I'm sorry, monsieur, there's no Eloise here. Eloise! Oui. I do not understand. But I think I'm only here a few weeks. I'm new so maybe I do not meet all of the other girls yet? No, no, no. Harry. Harry, it's me, Richard. I'm, uh, I'm about 20 minutes out, according to the GPS. Just passed St. Saturnin. I can't wait to see you. Anyway, I've left you 15 messages but I haven't heard anything from you. But either way, well I'll be with you in a few. And then we can get that rose open. Call me back when you get this. I think this is the magnum opus you've been hoping for. Louie! Come on, boy. Louie? Harry? Harry? What are you doing with that? I'm sorry, I was just. You were just what? Put it down. Put it down! Didn't your father ever tell you not to touch things that don't belong to you? That's mine! My finest work. Do you know how long that took? It's a masterpiece. I made a terrible mistake, I need to go. My dad's expecting me home. What are you going to do with that? What needs to be done. Harry, stop! You're hurting yourself! You don't know what pain is! You have no idea. Dad? Daddy, I don't have time to explain but I'm at Harry's. He's gone crazy. Please, just come as soon as you get this message. I had it all. I had it all. You've no idea. The pain will never leave me, Ethel. Every time I close my eyes, princess. Stop, stop, wait. Stop, wait. Harry? Harry? You inspired me. Everything you did. You built me up. You were my everything! Everything you did. You were my world. Oh shit. I'm not her, Harry, I'm not your daughter. You built me up! Ethel, the thing of it is I don't want to forget you. Harry! Stop! I'm afraid I'll forget you. It'll be okay. Love. True love. True love is the only thing that surpasses all of time. Daddy. "My grief lies all within "and these external manners of laments "are merely shadows to the unseen grief "that swells with silence in the tortur'd soul." It isn't easy to contemplate the death of one's own children. Eloise. She she was never really there was she? But your love for Ethel was. Eloise was a manifestation of your love for her. You yearned to be reunited with her so much, so strong was your love for your daughter, the one person who made you happier than anyone else, the one person no-one could ever hold a candle to. Grief poises man midway between destroyer and creator. One's mind carves a fairytale when one can't accept the harsh realities of the real world. Down here in the muck, scavenging and grasping for well, for hope, you created your very own fairytale right here in your gingerbread house and you stayed here to be with your child. Love is merely a madness. Daddy.
