We had fun in those days, remember? Little brother, my wife is finally pregnant. I wish for a son, a fast runner like you. Brother, I've been thinking... I was wrong between us. I hope you can forgive me. What's going on down there? Don't think too much! It's almost time. Wait 'til the women are gone. Husband, I'm joining the others. - Let's go? - Wait. Let's be sure they're really asleep, then go get them. Shithead! Atanarjuat's brother is running after you! Where are you?! He's trapped by the crack! He can't get away! This way! Over here! This way! Just keep running and you'll find it! I won't sleep 'til you're dead! Get the dogs! Did you find eggs? Wonderful! Cook them all so no one's hungry. Who's going to eat all these eggs? Father! What's wrong with me? Be calm, you're just scared. Who are you? Where am I? They're trying to kill me! Three men! They killed my brother! Have you seen them? We're all alone here. We see anyone coming right away. Daughter, go up and look around. Who are you? I'm Atanarjuat. My brother, Amaqjuat... He's the one they murdered. Husband, my skin is crawling! These men who are after you... Are they Sauri's people? It's Oki, Sauri's son. Do you know them? Are you one of them? Dogteam coming on the other side! That's good, they lost your trail. They won't know if you're here or not. Now what? Can you hide me? Let's put you in the seaweed! At least they won't smell you! Strangers! Old people. Who are they? Keep quiet! I'll do the talking. Just keep your eyes open. Let's go. Did you see anyone around here? What's going on? We're alone here. You're the only ones we've seen since we landed here. Pakak! Search the tent! Nothing. Look for blood along the ice! There's nothing. No sign of anyone. He could never get this far. Are you lying to me? Aren't you Sauri's son? How do you know who I am? Who are you? Where's Atanarjuat? Where are you hiding him? What's wrong with you?! We don't even understand what you're doing here! Yeah... Enough for now. You're looking for someone, but eat some eggs first. Then you'll go find him. I'm starving. Well, let's eat something. I'm stuffed! You really had me frightened there for a while! Have some more eggs! I'm too full already! So you're Qulitalik. My father thought you were dead. A long time ago, we moved down east. Your father, Sauri, is my nephew. Your grandmother, Panikpak, is my sister. We were coming to visit Igloolik. But now, I think we'll wait, and not go to Igloolik until after we go caribou hunting. I'm too stuffed to think. We're going to take off. Let's go. I want to find his body. You can get up now. Oki pissed right on top of me! Where should I put this? Put it there for now. Grandmother, my father wants you to have this meat. That's wonderful! Put it on that rock there. Atuat... Here, take it. Why? Your hands are already bloody. You're too much! Thank you, granddaughter. That Atuat! Why? Why what? Why can't I have her? Her husband is dead. Why are you keeping her from me? We don't steal women in this camp. How do you know Atanarjuat's no longer alive? Without clothes, no one could survive on the ice. Of course, he's dead. His soul is alive. He got away from you, son. You think so? I don't believe it! Little mother, don't hold back your tears. Let the crying come out. I've lived through hard times in my life. A day will come when you feel good about yourself again. How's the ice now? It has thickened up. Solid enough to cross all the way. I think I could get to Igloolik now. I'm tired of waiting. Oki's just a man like me. I can stand up to him. It's the spirit behind him I'm not sure about. Last time it almost got me. Only you can say if you're ready. You'll know when. Why all the noise? My breathing-hole's no good. Well, take mine if you're finished walking all around it. You spoiled it anyway. No good to me now. Get out of my way. Atuat is mine now. Help! Help! Come quick! Father! Father! Don't die! What happened? He tripped and fell on his knife! Oh, no! He tripped and stabbed himself! What's wrong? Somebody's lying on the sled! Mother, something's wrong with my father. Put him down there. Father fell and stabbed himself. Sauri was our leader for a long time. Now his son, Oki, will lead us! To take his father's place! My heart is breaking! You'll be a good leader, just like your father was. We'll help you. You, Atuat! When we were betrothed, you didn't want me. Now I want nothing to do with you! This is the last of our seal oil. I'm going to go to Oki. With Sauri gone, there's no one to feed us, no oil. I'll be all right here. Do what's best for my little husband. I know you'll always take care of me. Brother! We need your help right away! You have to come soon, brother! We need you to help us! Brother! Brother! We must go home with you. You tell me when you're ready to go home. Here. Your rabbit's foot. I'm ready now for what I have to do. Go home to Igloolik! That way. All right! My favourite thing to eat! Atuat, want to eat rabbit with me? That was a strange rabbit! I hope he chokes on it. That rabbit didn't have a chance with me. It really looks good. You see how fast I caught it? Just with my hands! How about a taste? Forget it! Eat some of that old seal meat if you're hungry! Well, it smells pretty bad. Tastes great. There goes my appetite. What a great sleep! Now I feel fantastic! That was the best rabbit I ever ate! A dogteam... Little daughter! There's a strange dogteam coming! Only Atanarjuat runs like that. How I wanted to see you! Finally, we're together again. I ''wolf'' you! You're my very own wolf. I love you. I don't know who you are, but you made me very happy! I have something for you. What are we going to do? What are you worried about? He's a friend of ours. We'll welcome him home. When would I ever let you dress as poorly as this? Here, let's put this on. It's beautiful! Now you'll be warmer! Atanarjuat! Atanarjuat, my dear husband! Husband! I can't believe you're still alive! I'm not surprised you can't believe it. Look at you! Dressed so nicely. Go back to your friends. Now you're dressed as you deserve! You see what he did to me! Are you just going to stand there? You wave you breasts everywhere. Don't complain when we see them! It's your own fault anyway! Let's go. Let's get some food ready to welcome our visitors. Something's wrong here. Oki ate too much of that rabbit! Maybe we should go after Atanarjuat by ourselves! Don't worry. Wait there with Qulitalik and his sister. We'll see each other again... soon. What? It's some kind of trick. Why are you so suspicious? You saw what he did to Puja. He hates us! Puja got what she deserved. My husband brought meat for everyone. But you, Oki... He wants you and your friends to come first. He wants to get rid... of all the heaviness in your hearts. So there won't be any bad feelings. Bad feelings? I don't have any bad feelings for Atanarjuat! Everyone's welcome in our camp. Of course, we'll go. Come on. Let's go eat. I'm tired of eating leftovers. Let's have some fresh meat! Are you guys coming? Maybe there's nothing to worry about. Yeah, right. Wonderful! Great to see you again! I'm happy you came back! Yes, I had a good summer! Grab some meat and bring it inside. Lots of caribou up that way. We had an awful time this year. Over there, the land was empty. We walked and walked... and hardly saw any animals. And they were really skinny! Even the adult bulls had no fat! Hey, let's go together next summer! We could really help each other! That's a great idea! This is so delicious! Eat as much as you want. I need to go piss. Look behind you. Come on... Pakak! Stab him! The killing stops here! Tonight, we'll meet together to drive away from all of us the evil in our lives for so long. Listen! We're not finished! Before we go on, we must forgive those of our family who've done things no one should ever do. For many winters now, we've been ruled, and frightened, as though that evil Tungajuak were still here with us! My own son Sauri's children - you, Oki, and you, Puja - have led a life of evil towards others, day after day! This has to stop, so our future generations can lead better lives. Abusing others, committing murders, telling lies... This has to stop now! I don't want to say this, but I'm speaking from my heart. My grandchildren, Oki and Puja, and you too, Pittiulaq and Pakak... I've known you all since the day you were born. You'll have to leave us now, and never come back! No! Grandmother! Grandmother, you can't mean that! No! Grandmother, no! I hope you will forgive each other, as I've forgiven you. Wherever you will live, try to lead a better life there. Now leave us! Now leave us! Dear wife! Sing my song! Where's my little husband? Kumaglaq! Dearest wife, sing my song!
