Sir. Um... - Sir... - Master Keegan, this is a letter to your parents explaining the circumstances of your suspension. That's mental. You're mental. You disrupted an entire block during class. You absolutely terrified Mrs. Stapleton. OK. Well, I'm glad I got this opportunity to tell my side of the story. There is no story. I disagree. I think there is a story. I think there's a story of when a faculty repeatedly hands out detentions to students for sitting on top of dangerous lockers that could fall over at any moment, when actually it's a health and safety management issue, and if you just screwed the lockers to the walls, they wouldn't be dangerous, but you don't. And I think it's because you're worried about reducing the value of your grade-whatever listed building, that one day you'll probably sell for billions and then divide that amongst the shareholders. That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. You haven't been in Mrs. Stapleton's class. You don't give a toss about the lockers, Lee. You just like to cause trouble. It's childish. This is St. Mark's. We don't indulge children, we make men. You of all people should appreciate that. A scholarship here is rare, Lee. Very rare. You don't realize how lucky you are. Hopefully you will now. Come in. Yes, Mr. Bates? Keegan's bag, Headmaster. Thank you. Is there something else? Oh, Lee. You planted that? Lee. Where are you going? Home. For good this time. No. That's mental. Yeah, it wasn't for the prank, either. Oh, and if you want your weed back, you'll have to go and have a chat with the Headmaster. - Zero tolerance policy. - Lee. Get in. Wait, wait, wait. I can do something. - Maybe if I talk to him... - He won't want you involved. Lee! Wait. I'm sorry, Dad. Why? Well, I'm just sorry you had to come and pick me up. It's not your fault, is it? Bell ends! I'm... I mean, no, it's not my fault. Thanks. There's no need to thank me. I wasn't gonna leave you there. They said I had to show you this. Shh! Shh! That's all very well, but the question people are asking me is, are we closing the borders? We're looking at all options and... It's a yes or no question, Minister. Yes or no? The situation is obviously developing very fast. Borders, yes or no? That's not the way we've ever responded to a pandemic, and... Are we going to quarantine the country? If you won't let me answer... Two weeks ago, Minister, there were people dropping dead in Europe, two weeks ago. Since the first reported cases... What would you suggest, then, Minister? Jesus, bloody government. Could this be a terrorist act? Why can't you just say "closing the borders"? I wish you would answer a question. How about my first one? Borders, yes or no? I mean, when we look at various precedents... What was it you wanted to show me? Um... Nothing, really. Just a, uh, video with a cute cat. I don't think your mum's coming home this summer, Lee. - Mum? - Lee! Thank God. Lee. Are you OK? He's really bad, Mum. Lee, listen to me. You can't catch it. Understand? You don't need to be scared anymore, love. You're gonna be OK. And... what about Dad? There's no cure. Lee? Baby. It's your blood. You're O negative. Only O negatives are immune. It's rare. You get that from me. I'm so sorry, Lee. Your dad is gonna die. Please don't hate me. You can't be alone, Lee. You have to be somewhere safe, with people you trust. Seems fine here. What about school? Lee? St. Mark's. I, uh... I can't go back there. Why not? Just the people, you know? They're just... Come on, it isn't the time, Lee. Go to St. Mark's. I'm not asking. Hello? This is occupied. Shit. Oh, shit! Shit, shit, shit! Come on! Come on! Come on! I'm gonna have you now! I'll fuckin' have you now, you bastard! For once, Lee, for once just do what I tell you. Will you go to St. Mark's? Wait for me there. Just wait for me. I'll get home, I promise. And, Lee... Be a good boy. Hello? Hello? Hello? Sir? Oh! Sorry, sir. Help. Hello, Lee. Hello, Nurse. It's Matron now, thank you. - Prick. - Sorry? Such a waste. We didn't even know he was still here. Matron died and he just... took off his ring... and never said a word about it. But he must have really missed her. Funny, he was always such a pervert when she was around. We? Well, it's not just you and me, Lee. B3 to 5-7, or we can go B32, B3-4-5, B5-5-4. Used to be a nightmare, but it's obviously pretty clear now. Anyway, we are going to take the lesser routes, because the main roads will be blocked or dangerous. I will take this, just in case. I am the only one to handle it, understood? Lee Keegan. Sir. You're on probation. OK, remember, we're looking for food with a long shelf life. That's packaged goods. So, forget organic, forget fresh. It's the opposite of everything you've been taught in food tech. And I suggest we go out in... Yes, Lee? Sorry, sir, it's just, how do we know there's anything left at Tesco? It's just that it's pretty mad out there. I passed a few shops on the way here and they were empty already. And Tesco's is, like, the first place you'd go to, so... Well, we have to try, Lee. Every little helps. Mac. You are vice-cap on this mission. Keep up the rear and keep everyone together. - Lee's short third man. - I don't know what that means. It means get on the team, man. Exactly. Now, boys, I know, I know it's been tough. But we have everything we need here. You may not feel it now, but this old place is still giving you all a head start. Help us! - Help us! - Mr. Hammond? Someone's coming. Jane, please, you need to hide us. Calm down, Mr. Hammond. Help us, Ken! Lock it. Sir, do you have the key? Sir! We, uh, will need to... to take the B roads. We're looking for any food with a good shelf life, really. Um... We need to stay strong. Stay together. I think this is gonna be a good challenge for us all to overcome. Where are they? - Where are they? - Who? - Are you in charge here? - I'm in charge. Who are you? I represent Worham Town, and the authority of Georgina Baker... former magistrate and mayor of Worham Parish Council. You're from the Parish Council? Yes. Actually St. Mark's falls within the parish borders. Did you know that? Are you... Are you trying to frighten us? A bit. The two people you're hiding are thieves. They stole from Worham Town. Are you serious? We have to enforce the rule of law. In case you hadn't noticed, there's no one left to do that around here. It's about the message, you know? And what will happen to them? They'll be fine. I just need you to hand them over. Would you open this, please? There's nothing in there. Nevertheless. It's a cleaning cupboard. We don't have the key. And there's nothing in there. OK. Then this won't matter. Run! Run! Run! Howzat! Lee! Mac! Oh, God. Oh, God. Is everybody OK? Ken. The keys. The keys? Oh, Jesus Christ. Tie her up with something. Is Mr. Hammond going to die? This isn't a hospital. We can keep it clean, drain it. But we don't have the drugs for infection and we definitely don't have any blood. - You mean like a transfusion? - Yeah. Well, can we use ours? That's not how it works, Lee. There are types. If you'd paid attention in class... - Mac, what blood type are you? - No idea, mate. Great, thanks. Matron, what blood type are you? - O negative. - Sir? - Same. - We all are. That's the only reason we're alive. - That means Hammond is too. - Mister Hammond. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. OK. OK, there's a GP surgery near Dunroamin. They might have some antibiotics. - Can you go first thing? - Yes. Will this do, sir? Rowles. What happened in Worham? Did you really take something? What did you take? A tin of beans. And a Dino. Maybe we should keep the gate locked from now on, huh? "Do we still hear nothing of the noise of the grave diggers who are burying God?" "Gods, too, decompose." "God is dead, God remains dead, and we have killed him." I don't believe in God, anyway, so it's not a problem. You all right? Contextually, yeah. - Thank you. - You smashed it. You're welcome. Whoa. What now? - The body. - Bodies. And a dog. The Headmaster. And Archie. I'm sorry, I'm not doing that again. Dad. OK. So we're on dinner. Come on, you lot. Do you reckon there's like a safety on this or what? Oh, Chef, you legend. Grub's up. Lights out in ten. It's OK. Set it down over there. And thanks for your help, Lee. Keep helping, will you? Ooh, that's sore. Lights out! Lee? Yeah? I killed someone today. You had to. Let's go get some drugs. What? You drive, right? I don't have a license yet. I think that's OK. Oh. Why don't we do a little recon? Stay low. Stay low. What's... Where'd that come from? Bates. Bates's room. Where do they get the guns? It's not military. Just farmers and hunters, I guess. We need to find us a farmer. Come on. Let's get the hell out of this parish, shall we? Miss. Miss, what is it? What is it? OK, you need to calm down. You need to calm down and tell me what is it? What is it? I can't move. You're taped to the chair. No. I can't move. I can't move anything! Right. Get medicine, be heroes. It's quite nice outside of school, innit? Yes, dickhead, there's actually people and everything. I mean, there were people. Not round here, though. This is all just holiday homes for people like you. The man. City money. Gutting the rural heart of Britain with empty mansions that just sit here and do nothing. I mean, what is the point? Empty. Hello? Whee-yaaaa! Yes, lad! Hello? I can... Hold on. Whoo! That was shit. Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Well, that's good. OK, O-neg nominations. You choose five people that turn out to have had O-neg blood, and you get to start the world with them again. Uh, Winston Churchill. They have to be alive at the time of the virus. Um... Bates? Just to annoy you. You know his wife left him? - OK... - After the virus hit. Just took their daughter and ran. Brutal. Tells you something, though, doesn't it? - You take the left. - OK. Who would you pick? You'd want a doctor. A real one, not Matron. Seems like you'd probably need a good military leader as well. You'd want some good all-rounders in terms of, like, rebuilding. Bear Grylls? That'd be all right, Bear Grylls, yeah. Ariana Grande. Definitely. You know, cos of... her understanding of infrastructure. Mac! I know what you're thinking. It looks like shit when it's dry. That's not what I was thinking. It's the blood. The blood is the life. Yeah. We know. Can you let my friend go, please? No. You made a right mess of it in here. I'm sorry. This is NHS property. - Please, please! - Shhhh! Please, don't! Just, just... Wait, we'll put everything back where it was, OK? And I can tell you where there's a whole school full of people with the blood and everything. And we can just... tell me what you want me to do, please. - Wait your turn! - No, no, no, no! Filthy fucking... Whoa, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac! - Fuck off! - Mac, it's over, it's done. - Fuck off! - It's done. Fuck off! Fuck off, you nut! Here, mate. Have a wet wipe. Hello? Hi. How do we know you won't shoot us? Because I haven't yet. Where are you boys from? Nowhere, really. Quite a hoard you've got here. It's just, um, stuff we travel with, you know? Hmm. I'm Georgina. Georgina Baker. Right, cool. Well, um... thanks for your help. We're looking for my daughter. Have you seen her? No. Nope. She was last seen pursuing a criminal fraternity back near the parish border. If you do see her... We will bring her straight to Worham. Thank you, boys. Please do. You can keep this. Nice school, that. Thanks? Now he is military. Stupid girl. Even the simplest thing is... Did we say "Worham" at any point? No. We did not. Where the hell have you been? - New arrivals. - All right, Wolf? It's been better. Patel, right? - I'm Mac. - Yeah, I know. You once made me drink three pints of milk. You guys must have been through a lot. Come in. Yeah, but you're still bloody idiots. These are for you. Oh, Jesus. Well, at least you didn't get into trouble. Um, well, actually, there's something we need to tell you about our captive. Really? I was going to say the same thing to you. Right. Right. Yeah, they've got a pretty impressive setup too. Here, you can, um... - Oh. It's broken. - Great. Thanks. Well, I suppose we have to give her back. What, and just say she was like that when we found her? Can you do anything? - Her spine is broken. - So no? We've got a lot of space here. OK? We just keep her, like, hidden. Forever? Forever? Feeding another mouth? - Cleaning her up? - Mac. Only until things get back to normal. Can everyone please stop pretending that things are going back to normal? Look... I hate to be the one to say it, but... there is an obvious solution here. I don't like it at all, but... I mean, we can't send her back. We can't keep her here. What if she... disappeared? Jesus bloody wept! I'm just saying. A million things could have happened to her out there. Enough, Sean! We are not having this conversation. Not in this school. Your father was an MP. He'd be ashamed. Oh, you think so? Mum died years ago. Cancer. Dad... three weeks. They said he'd call, but... Both OK, I think. But... they're in Mumbai, so... I honestly have no idea. Fuckers were in Bermuda when it hit. Um... Mum's coming. To absent parents. To parents. Lee! Hello? Mr...? Mr. Bates. Hello again, boys. Are you in charge here, Mr. Bates? Yes. Yes. We'd like to come inside and have a look around, if we may. Well... why? Why not? You can't come in. You want the school. There are orphaned children in here. They have nowhere else to go. Is my daughter in there? No. Then you won't mind us coming in. Um... Well, I'm sorry... - Don't apologize to her. - Shh, Mac. I don't think we... We can't risk that. I don't want the school and I don't want anyone hurt. Mine or yours. So, you have 24 hours. Let us in or bring her to us. After that, we will be coming in regardless. Stan? Surround the school. Nobody in or out. Understood? All right! It's time to grow up. We need to start taking shifts 24/7, patrolling the perimeter of the school and keeping watch from the tower with the rifle. Now, you kids, you're gonna have to be very strong and very brave for us from now on, OK? We might have to ration a little more. - Do we know what rationing is? - Mac, listen to me. Listen to you fucking what? What? Mac, don't talk to Mr. Bates like that. You're not a teacher. And you're just a little boy. I fucking told you so. We should have got rid of her when we had the chance. OK, OK. All right. I think... Look, you lot can go back to bed. There is nothing to worry about. There is a great deal to be worried about. There are people outside those walls who want to take everything we have, who want to hurt us. - That's not what they want. - Oh, you don't think so? Lee? Uh... I mean, yeah. Yeah. Th-They do seem to kill a lot of people. So... I mean, what shall we do? Right, so you're in charge now, are you, Mac, you and Lee? Me? What do you guys think? Mac and Lee. Sorry, sir. Oh. Oh, brilliant. Fantastic. That's just great. Come on then, Mr. Billy Big Bollocks! What are we gonna do?! What we've always done. Trust in St. Mark's. First things first. These are not toys. They are insanely dangerous. Thank Christ there aren't more of them in this country or we'd be completely screwed. Shotgun. Rifle. Shotgun. Rifle. You've all played Call of Duty. You know how that works. Rifle shoots long and accurate, the shotgun has a spread. That's important. If you're using this around your fellow students, make sure they are nowhere near the firing line. Rowles. Bang! I thought you were different. At least he has a plan. Yes, a... great plan. What's this? We can't take Mini Baker out of here now. Not with them watching, right? Not in one piece. But... bit by bit. In the lake. In the grounds. In the flowerbed. You know, like that Christmas movie in the prison. Then we rinse the place down and invite Big Baker in. Poke around all she likes, she's not gonna find a trace. What do you think? What do I think? Mac. Uh... You wanna win this or not, Lee? Cos your mum's not coming to save us. Ooh. You nearly got me to be fair. - OK, OK. - Where are you going? Patrol. Hiya. Well, I mean, I think I cut someone. You think you've done it? How can you not know? Come on. Eh, eh. Ooh. Hey, where and when, Wylie, huh? Where and when, huh? - Fuck! - Where and when? - Fuck off! - Wylie, Wylie! - Fuck off! - Chill out. - Dickhead. - Chill out. You don't have to be ashamed. You could do it right now if you want to. Hey. Come with me. Ms. Baker? Miss, can you come? Someone's hurt. Shh! That's my mum. She was serving in Iraq when the virus hit. I want nothing more in the whole world than to see her again. So I understand. I do. I have a very vested interest in figuring some sort of way out of this. So can we find a way out of this? It's Lee, isn't it? Did she call you that? - I guess. - Hmm. Well... OK, Lee. If you can prove to me that my daughter isn't in there, maybe we can. Your move. I can't prove that. Because she is in there. Go on. There's something you have to understand. She started it. Nobody here is responsible for this. She was just doing her job. Her job's shooting at children? Look, I have no doubt she buggered it up. But that doesn't change anything for me, Lee. In the days after the virus hit, I saw panic. And then I saw panic change very quickly to savagery, in people that I'd lived with and worked with. But it must have always been there, right? Beneath the surface. So someone somewhere dropped the wrong petri dish. Fine. But in a world of mobile pornography, open borders and franchise bakeries, you were heading for a collapse one way or another. I can remember a time when things were better, but it wasn't right before the virus. Have you asked yourself how this place looks? To us? To outsiders? This used to be a fine school. But now, like everything else, it's... broken. Corrupted. I have no faith anymore, Lee. No faith in people. No faith in the future. All you can do is look after your own. Because even if we rebuild, it's still going to be there, this awful thing that I see here now, in a boy called Lee with a gun at his feet. Now's your chance. Both of you. You can't be a virgin anymore. Wylie, you want to get involved? What the hell are you doing? I wouldn't want to trouble you with it, sir. How bloody dare you? Who the hell are you? You're not one of our boys. More than you are. You stop this right now, Sean MacKillick! Let me offer you this. Give me my daughter now, and maybe we don't come in and take her. OK. That's good, that's really good. One last thing before we do that. I want to warn you of some changes to Claire that you may find slightly upsetting. During the incident... If you've hurt one hair on her head, I swear by the God who left us a long time ago... I'll wear your skin as a onesie. Hold... and up. This is madness, boys! It's a rite of passage, actually, sir. Believe it or not, I've been there myself. Back in the day. What the hell are you doing? Now, be a man and do the right thing. You're insane. This must be exhausting for you. All of you. Being so right all the time. How can everyone be so right? I agree, nothing's changed. The whole world dies and somehow now there are more people telling me what to do. Fuck you. Fuck you! I can promise you this. If you don't pack up and fuck off, she is gonna die! And it won't be my doing. He's almost finished. It's a baker's dozen. - Go on, boys. - Don't you dare. Last one. Stop! Hold. Let him go. Hold. You stop now. - Hold! Hold! - Stop now! Stop! Let it go. Get off him! Now! Get off! He's not breathing! - I have to help him. - Nobody move. - Please. - Stay where you are! In fact, no, get in there. Get in there, now! All of you! You three, on your knees. On your knees and stay there! You, untie her. She isn't tied. Don't try to mess with me, son. She can't move. She can't move at all. Get on your knees. - Hey, look... - Get on your knees! Oh, sweet girl. Oh, Christ! Come on! Come on, move it! Go, go, go! Come on, hurry up! Move on! Come on! Go, go, go! Please! Stop him! Hold it! - Come on! - Put the gun down! Wait, wait, wait! That's what you get when you fuck... OK. OK. Everyone to the concourse. All non-combatants to the concourse. Did something happen? Great patrol. You need to each get to your choke points. Keep them away from the concourse. We need someone to fill in for Bates. - Where is Bates? - Mac killed him. Come on, Mac! Don't let him do that to you. - Stop. - Come on, Mac. Stop! This isn't helping. Stop! You're out of order. Everything I've done, I've done for us. For St. Mark's. Matron, you're going to be Bates. - Oh, thank you. - Get the kids to the concourse - and look after Hammond. - So be the nurse, then? Everyone else, stick to the plan. Let's go, team, huh? Let's go, come on! St. Mark's! Come on! Stay alive, Lee. It's what your mum would want now. What are you doing? I just thought... No. Go on! Come on, come on. Jesus Christ. Hey! Mac! Here. Gimme that! It worked. Come on! Come on! Wait. P-Please don't, please. I don't wanna be here. I don't wanna do this. No, no! Lee, you need to get on it... What's your name, son? - Rowles. - Rowles. You look like a good boy, Rowles. Just put the gun down. Then you can go, OK? You can just go. Right out that door. Nobody's gonna get hurt. That's not what I'm here for. That's OK. On the floor. Now... where are they keeping my daughter? The concourse. Show me. Mummy's here. Hey. Hey. Sorry. Sorry. Oh! Wolf! Wylie! Oh! Wylie, go! Come here! Wylie! Wylie! Wylie... Stay with us, Mr. Hammond. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Take it. Use it. Claire? She's dead. No. It's not for St. Mark's. It's for you. Ladies and gentlemen. Boys and girls. What an awful summer we've had. "He was tall but round..." We've achieved so much since then. We've improved our diversity. And our security. Entered a new era of diplomacy. And even begun caring for the frail and elderly. And we couldn't have done any of those things if it hadn't been for one of our most brilliant students. Lee Keegan. To whom today we must also bid a fond farewell. Lee is going to the coast. And may be going further even than that. He's looking for his mother. Because he loves her very much. You could tell him that it's the stupidest idea in the world. But Lee doesn't like being told what to do. We hope... we insist, in fact, that he comes back in one piece. He'll always be welcome here. And no matter where his journey takes him, he'll always be a student of St. Mark's.
