Rajanna, leave this matter here. I have to go to library to read. don't spoil your future for me. Sorry sir. What is this lallan… What is happening..? What's todays special in Dhoolpet game? Do you not have any shame? Get out of here. Enough of studying. Have something to eat. Brother, Kaushik and his gang are protesting asking for seats & scholarship for our people. Sathya! Down down. Okay, I'll go there day after tomorrow. Ramnayak, get up! Did you come here to sleep? We can't let him get away! Okay okay! Hey, get me one beedi and two teas. Hey! Stand up. Stand up! Why should I? I'm from Lalan's gang. Who is that? Wait right here, I'll show you. Useless guy with useless news. Nobody understands him. Brother, can you fill this form out for me? Pass me the pen They've opened a bangle shop next to the canteen, shall we go shop there? maaya.. Can you pass me that pen! Where are these people? Tell me five things that George was fighting for, just like crisp & five things you can tell me. Only 5? I can name 500. He stopped ragging against students. He fought for everyone to get the same food in the canteen. He's made sure that everyone who deserves a scholarship, got one. There are many more things that George Reddy has done for the students, madam. One of these days, George will face these people as well. Come here. Come here, fool. Greetings, madam. Get him, get him now. Hit him.. Hit him! Do you not know who I am? Lalan! Greetings, Koushik. -Greetings Arjun, Take it. Thank you What kind of people are they!? George.. Brother, did you see how that Arjun and Koushik are talking to each other? Their people are fighting each other in public. This! Rajanna, you had to talk to me about something? What else is there? That Lalan and outsiders are always doing this. What are they saying? What is this? Do you know how many people are there? We can't tell the students and outsiders apart. That's how many they are. They're even harassing the girls. As long as the outsiders are present in campus, this won't be resolved. Who are all of you? Hey, where did you come from? Dhoolpet Why aren't you saying anything? What work do you have in campus? Why are you harassing the girls? If I see any of you here again, I'll finish you right here.! He's getting ahead of himself. I'll show him. Where did you guys come from? Who allowed you in here? Hey, show your man hood and come here. You were talking something until now, where are you going? Come here. From tomorrow, if anyone wants to meet or talk to the girls, they should think twice. Jyothi, don't go anywhere, stay right next to me. Are you listening? If anyone is out of line, I'll beat each and every one of you. Idiot, you complained to the VC about me? About me? From tomorrow and I'll teach you what'll happen if you disobey me. I'll finish you all right here. Get out of here! George.. Hi Dada, I've heard they're troubling the students here. The rich are ruling the campus. They're even entering the hostels and ragging people. And we need to shut this down as there is no other go. I think you step up and do something about it bro. Hey, what are you doing here? Why do you care? Fool, what happened? If I see you ragging people here again, I'll strip you down and beat you. You can eat something Village and stay there. take this. Did you come here to kill me? Stay right here, I'll go study and come back. Let's meet in the library then. Okay, I'll leave now. See you later. Okay, brother. hey chotu... Yes, brother. Are you Kishan Singh's brother? If there's ever a fight again. You can tell Balu about it. Understand. Okay! I'll see you later! Don't know what to do outside hence doing all these PH.D's. Do you know another thing? If I die, cremate me right here and I'll rest in peace! Don't say that, brother. The Government doesn't give us scholarships for us rest here. We should go out and grow in life. He is Raghu, my friend. And he is the new professor from today. George Reddy has become a hero in campus. Outsiders are scared to even enter because of him. It's not only that, Koushik. He's not thinking twice also before beating the upper caste people. This isn't the campus I expected at all. It's very dangerous here. Is there anyone fighting this with you? What's your name? Which college are you from? I asked you. Tell me. Who allowed you in here? Get out of here right now. Stand up.. Stand up. What is this? Did you try cheating and get caught? Stop it, brother! What about our respect? What's happened has happened. Let it go. Do you think this is funny? He told me this in front of everyone in the class. Let me see him outside and I'll finish him. I'll show him who my brother is. Explain it to them! They're troubling me since then! Brother, let it go. Look i am telling you, i'll leave the vehicle and walk away Okay okay, let's go. Look. Even I can't hold my laughter. Brother, why is he making fun of him? The exam results will be posted on the bulletin board of your respective college premises today at 3pm. Move out my way... Give me space. Who wrote their names on both sides to disrespect? Hey I am telling you to move aside. They didn't announce my name. I think your parents does not put the name. If you wrote the exam your name will come. Why would it come otherwise? Each and everyone of us is losing respect. Shameful. You've disrespected me in front of the whole class. Let me show you. Fool, do you know who I am? Lalan Get him. Get him Idiot, I'll kill you. Go Hit it. I've been in tension all morning. I'm scared. I've not even been able to pee since then.

My family is working hard everyday to make sure I study and I'm disrespecting them by not studying. They're sacrificing even basic meals to get me new clothes and make sure I study. I've disrespected them completely. exams are like passing clouds. To succeed in life you need three things. A wishbone, a funnybone, and a backbone. u have all three of them What are you looking at? Play. You've helped me pass my exams. How much work is this for you? Hey... your win is confirmed. Just play Brother, they've beaten Ramana Master. Who are they? Lalan and the outsidesr.

Bye. Thank you. What did he say? No idea, brother. Let's go. What happened, brother? What did he say? Why are all of you silent? I'll never forget the time we spent with you, George! Have tea, brother. all the best george..! Study well He'll anyway study well. You all need to study well now, like me. You're one to talk. You're studying so hard. I have a small request from you people before I leave this campus. What? A lot of people are looking for courage in the books You should talk to such people for atleast 10 minutes. Why are you packing your clothes? Where are you going? You've read all the books George gave you and turned into a library. I'm talking to you only! What happened?! George likes me. He still has the pen he borrowed from me. He's keeping my handkerchief and reading every book I gave him. What proof you want, that he likes me? Why the hell are you asking me this? You can directly ask him! Come to Arts College tomorrow. George is holding a meeting! Hey Lalitha Come to Arts College tomorrow. George is holding a meeting! I'll be there. Koushik, that fellow is holding a meeting everyday at different places. There's a meeting near the Arts College. We shouldn't let it happen, Koushik. We have to do everything, we can to stop that meeting from happening. hello brother...! Hi Sai, have a seat! Take 50 of our men tomorrow to George's meeting. To fight him? To Support him. What are you saying, Koushik? Why would we support him? Jayanth, we're losing the election! You're a mastermind at planning this, brother. Sathya! Who the hell is he, brother? He came here recently. He is changing his colors everyday. What is his plan after all? He wants a meeting near the Arts College, apparently! Can anyone host a meeting without the president's permission? It's not only him. Other's will gain courage from looking at him and do this tomorrow. There's no meeting, nothing. Get out of here. I'm talking to you guys, get out of here. What is this opposition for everything we say, brother? Let's go now. It's time for the meeting. Ramu, get out of here. Rajanna is here, look guys. I was talking about you guys only! Atleast you guys go for the meeting! We don't want to attend any meetings, get lost. The meeting is for you guys. What happened to you people? Did someone threaten you? Did someone hurt you? Tell me, I'll break his bones. I can't help but laugh at Rajanna. He's coming... Ramu, go, get out of here. Go Ramu. Do none of you have any shame? He's working so hard to help all of you only. Go sit in the hostel quietly now, you cowards. No one will come dada..! Didn't I tell you they won't come? They won't. Bloody turncoats all of them. Didn't I tell you they won't come? They won't. They are like sheeps These people need a beating. They won't come to their senses otherwise. Idiots... They get scared of every tom and dick. ... Eunuchs! does it seem like we are inviting them for a marriage? Manipal, lets go and smash their heads. Let's go! What nonsense are you doing here..It's a problem If i come or don't come. Don't talk shit.. I will slap you otherwise Will you murder me and become rowdy rajanna I"ll kill you if he is going to come between us. Raajanna.. Brother... Brother... Brother... Brother, We made a game plan and took 50 members but they were 5000 members. 5000 members? What.. 5000 members for George meeting? Yeah Brother! Who the hell is this .....? Thanks for trusting me and coming here. Will tell you one thing. Please remember it. nothing can be created.. nothing can destroy anything...! This sense of fear has not born today. Nothing can kill the courage of retaliation from your heart. The day after today… A new way of thinking and a new identity..! Let's forget the issues and take a step forward.. Will this campus problems get resolved..? Brother, I am going mad by seeing this crowd. Operation and humilation is to death then assault is to fearlessness even if the Injustice were being done, not letting us move, not letting us breath by putting a chunk of burning coal on the chest. Its time to break this undemocratic silence. If anyone tries to assault anybody in the name of religion and caste, I'll Slap them. Chase them and hit if they fail to provide you good food. If anyone tries to stop your research or scholarships or anything for that matter, Ask them firmly. No one is teaching no one here in the name of mercy. This university is running only with the taxes that are being paid by our parents with their hard earned money. So, eradicate the thought of rich & the poor from your mind. Study for your self confidence. Fight for your self respect Death lies nowhere but in our self confidence We are with you George! one person like you is enough for us. Gully people. How many we have seen.. Have you ever thought you would see me like this? I have started something similar five years back. Something new is going to start. raise your voice...! raise your voice...! raise your voice...! raise your voice...! raise your voice...! raise your voice...! raise your voice...! Before the truth dies…! did you see granny? how your campus is changed? ok bye. say bye to granny..! bye .bye..! you know I have something for you This is the best pictures I got of yours and granny. Same you look just like her Do you have any recent pictures..? Oh yeah, I have some pictures actually see… I will send this to you. Ma’am, I have a question I heard that in your college days you guys were scared to go out. Is it true? Most of the time. Wait I have something for you too. this? George did this with his own hands. Yes, my father used to tell me. But, I never thought I will see Madam. I am leaving university because of higher studies… What is this bro, every day one guy comes & gives us sermon. Did you see? Why do we care if someone talks...? No We have enough of ours...! Our campus should shine with culture, heritage, and ethics like it does every time. stop…! people were praising us for our yesterday meeting. see now!. from today onwards Arjun will look after you and party too. Hail India…! look… hey, look. oh, respected elder look. how did he even born. Till now those guys listened to Satya bro like sheeps. from now they will listen to Arjun. When will they change… animals! they will raise Voice when they want to change. Go… go and ask. Rey, go…go ask to raise their voice you go and ask to raise their voice I will ask them for sure I will ask them but not me. Sridevi Sir came Greetings!. why did you come here? We want only the land which belongs to us but not any other land, what’s the use sir by the land which doesn’t belong to us? See, you guys used to stay in a hut. Government sanctioned you a house instead of land,why are you bothered. let us go sir... Hey, they don’t care about us no matter how many days pass. Koushik... Sir, this time sathya is not in competition instead that brainless Arjun is competing. Sit,Sit …. you also sit…! please sit Nobody wins with this attitude. you know what’s your problem is?… you are not using your attitude in a right way. you should convert his attitude as your sympathy in people. Understood. Ok sir, next time i will do as you said. ok, good. I will take a leave sir. Dear students, there are three parties in the race for this year's election announcement. VC gave permission to start their campaigning from tomorrow. Koushik zindabad. Arjun zindabad. Everybody started their campaigning… look we are doing march past. Hi Maaya, do you have any work, or did you just come to class like that? what are you searching? Do you want anything…? We need a flag for our party. Flag? Does your party have any Agenda? We would like to fight back injustice happening in our campus. Our flag should reflect that emotion. Then red color flag is correct for you…! Hey Nagaraju. yes brother. Come here. Maaya, give me your hair band once. give me your hand. fold your wrist. Hey, stick this to that wall. Hey, stick it properly. Hey, stick here. What the hell are you looking at? lets stick those. We might be product of our past. But not prisoners of it. From past three years you served like slaves and you take us for granted you will see CheGuevera . My aim is to make Arjun step down from that position, and i need your help for that. Jai hind... Jai hind. No matter how much sound a grass hoper makes it won’t ever become a lion. From last three years, students are expecting our win and their loss. In between small parties are getting prepared for the race. we should kill them in the first stage itself..! Vande Mataram... Do you know which Is that one flag flying in the country and the college ? The flag of dominance. Its not the flag but the agenda is important. Are they even talking about that ? No. because they only seek dominance. If not him it let it be someone else and viceversa. Thats how they want to rule one after the other. To put an end to these attrocities is our ajenda. Bro, pan. You keep listening to the songs. come. Hey, donkey tell her, she keeps hiting all the time. Not going to college but sitting at home like a women. These days students are clapping even for the newbie beggers. Hey Party gets the energy only when there are chunk of people behind it. Claps for a couple of words. This is not we want. We want. Sympathy. Sympathy? How? That abcd gang, not just us But they've beaten whoever supported us. They'll hit you too. They'll hit you for no reasons. So, you call this politics? Arjunaa Tell laxmana Arjunaa. Did you notice these chaos? That guy inspired women to question back This chubby man earns sympathy by hitting his own gang with his team. Hey Arjunaa this university is being turned into a battalfiled. koushik zindabad. koushik zindabad PS Zindabad You dont worry bro. this time we will win for sure. Hey stick it fast. Hey Ramakrishna what are you doing...? Hey Sai what work do you have here.get lost. Why this over action. Hey stop it. Hey stop it. Hey, Stick it fast. This time the competition is between three guys sir. The elections here are going way beyond the political elections. they are provoking each other sir.Fights may happen at any time. Its better to have security in our campus. If anyone breaks the rule. I will suspend them. They show the sky & the moon but give us peanuts in the end. Enough feeding them like pigs. We've done a mistake by giving them the power. Its high time to rectify our mistakes. We don't want any customs. Development. I'll achieve that. I'll be with you. Inspite of the freedom we have made ourselves and the party prisoners. Look at the other independent nations Look at their development. Why? Because They've believed in their own religion & tradition. if the same opportunity is given to you... You will misuse that too. Spit. You're misleading the people in the name of our country. Mind it. Be careful. Do you have the courage? I repeat Arts college or Engineering college? To all those agents who care for the neighbouring countries, Be careful. does problems get solved by throwing questions. is this what we need right now? there is emotional politics. Are you trying to be the winner by creating hatred. That is the reason why the strong suppresses the weak in college elections. Hence these fights in university. Don’t fall in this bloody trap. Remind all the students about the good work they do. Tell them, even though the flags are different but the agenda is the same. Raise your voice...! what have you done brothe?. How many days...! You need our students votes only during elections? What have you done when we were on the roads for mess fee hike You say elections are for change after you win you change your agenda . After all these years what have you done with the power you had.? when we ask for scholarships aren't you the one who asked our caste & religion what have you done when students are suffering from ragging ? Did anyone bother when we complained about maggots in the rice ? we are the one who cast our votes to make you win but you give scholarships to your group of people. what kind of justice is this ? Do you work only if you have power or what ? Hey Nitin. Koushik you stopped sticking posters just because they are asking questions ? that ABCD group people pasted their posters on ours . hmm.., not only that,they are planning to hit us also. In an hour all the posters of Arjun should be plastered with cowdung . Arjunaa! its raining questions in the campus. all these response is because of that newbie Reddy fellow using the same slogan "Raise your Voice " Even before the response begins, we should be ready with one answer to all the questions that have been asked. I thought George is only man of words. Will wait for the right time. even a small mistake happens we will put him a check. Rajanna Bro.. Tomorrow elections. Get everyone by 8'o Clock. Go safe son , don't get in to fight on the way . Bro, you go and drop him . kill you !

First, we should complain to the VC. That’s already been done, brother. The VC isn’t who we should be complaining to.. Hey man, you just got here. Why do you want to start fights again? HEY! How many times should I tell you not to get involved in these matters. Let it go. He’s not worth. Let me know who to meet. We shouldn't leave him. Who we need right now isn’t the VC. Dear friends, I don’t intend on speaking to you about the injustice that I have been put through today. It’s about the farmers killing themselves. Our leaders have time to eat but, They don’t have the time to think about the farmers working hard to provide us with this food.. We fought for a week regarding the insects in our food. We shut down our campus and even rounded the police stations for a week. But, did anyone think about the farmers who poisons themselves using pesticides? Did you even question it? You’re right, George! Even my father is a farmer. He recently drank pesticides and killed himself. I watched him struggle but couldn’t do anything to help him. Let’s question them. I am with you George, we are all with you. Let’s do it together. Farmer’s rule, must live on. Justice for the farmers! Farmers Zindabad!. Arjun bhai... Arjun bhai... What happened? Lalan, What are you doing at this time? I’ve lost all respect because of that kid! What face do I have to show at college? I’m ashamed to go anywhere in the college . Nonsense! I was born and brought up here! Kishan Singh’s younger brother. Lallan.. Lallan Singh is my name! Terrible He’s ruined my reputation on my turf. He’s made a fool out of me. People used to wet their pants at my sight. Today they’re questioning me. I wake up get treated like a woman. Lallan is a panzy, they say. Is this college belongs to his family?? He’s helping anyone in need. Is he that big of a man? It’s either him or me. You’re not understanding, Arjun bhai. I would’ve died, but I’m alive today. I’m not showing my face anywhere. I’m unable to swallow even a morsel of food. This time I'm going to contest in engineering college elections Understand my frustration, Arjun bhai. Did you see that, Arjun? His hunger. His urge. If everyone gave everyone what they wanted, the war of Kurukshetra wouldn’t have happened and this nation wouldn’t have been born. “His empire was so overpowered that he loved the pride”. Kurukshetra set the stage for the defeat of the Pandavas or the defeat of the Kauravas. This is what the Pandavas asked for. Today, he’s only thinking about this college. Let’s go. Save the Farmers! We’ll fight for them till our last breath! We’ll fight for them till our last breath! Farmer is the backbone of the nation they said. But look at this condition today. He is committing suicide on the same soil that he want's to use till Let's maintain two minutes of silence for the same system which is no more. They’ve put barbed wire to strangle the students. As a political leader, let me know what I can do to help you. All these problems can only be solved by one person, sir. I need to meet him once. Greetings, sir Greetings! Student leader George Reddy would like to speak to you for 2 minutes. I need to urgently leave to Delhi, no time for this. System down down… The Government’s attitude must be destroyed. The nations future is in the hands of our students. One picture please. There’s a lot of wrong happening on campus, sir. It’ll start off small but eventually be a big headache, sir. The press is also making it a big deal, sir. If they have the will to scream.. Law and order is in your hands. Save the Farmers! Save the Farmers! Save the Farmers! The Government’s attitude must perish Justice to the farmers! To face this repression. power must be ours. Then we transform our life Rajanna, we must tell the students of all states what we are fighting for. Hyderabad - Regional News The Osmania University turmoil of the last two days has hit the peak today. Student union leader George Reddy protested against the system. Learn to die if you want to live! Fight for your every right. Is the motto he’s taking up There’s no competition for this years election. It’s an easy win for George. Really? George bro will win, this is a guarantee. What’s your name? Bharat. Which college do you attend? engineering first year! You? engineering first year...! You idoit. Do I look crazy to you? You scum, bloody scum. Come here, you. Come here. Engineering students should support me. What do you think of yourself by supporting him? If I happen to lose these elections, Ask him what will happen next. Are you men? Remember my name. Lallan. Dear friends, I write to you during these testing times....... who are the nourishers of the nation grasping at straws but there seems to be no solution.. To their problems I as a fellow students and a sympathizer of the charity, request you to join. Leave the matter to me, leave the whole arts college matter to me. Just concentrate on the engineering college issue and leave the rest to me. What’s this nonsense? I’m being serious, leave me alone. Hey! Why? I shouldn’t talk? Don’t you dare, speak! If you say anything else, I’ll forget our friendship and end you right here. What’s this guy saying? What’s this madness? What’s happening here? Since he wake up, these guys haven’t studied and this guy. He doesn’t have any clothes to wear, he will never get a scholarship. Someone like me doesn’t have a brain is what people like him think. Isn’t it? Don’t we know why he’s here at the campus? What has this campus ever done for him? What has it given him? He had 22 Stabbes on his back. You’re the reason for this to happen. His silly mother just wants one thing for him. For her son to study well. She helped him to overcome these struggles. Won’t you let him live peacefully? He’s always involved in fights for this college. Death falls upon us only once. Until when will you pressure us into keeping our mouths shut? A small fire can burn down a forest in a day. Now is our time, the fire in us is burning. According to Section 144 of Campus Law, any students roaming in groups Legal action will be taken against those responsible for any undesirable events or unrest. “Learn to die if you want to live" "Fight every step of the way for your right” “Learn to die if you want to live" "Fight every step of the way for your right” “Learn to die if you want to live"" "Fight every step of the way for your right” “Learn to die if you want to live" Sir, should I take action against them? "Fight every step of the way for your right” “Learn to die if you want to live"" "Fight every step of the way for your right” “Learn to die if you want to live"" "Fight every step of the way for your right” “Learn to die if you want to live"" Hey Lalan inspite of getting beaten all the boys roaming with George Reddy only. Lalan. For the first time in my life, I’ve trusted you and you’ve let me down Arjun, do you mean our Lallan? What happened? Why’s he quiet? Tsk Tsk Tsk…. Hey! I was born here, brought up here. I’m Kishan Singh’s brother! Lallan… Lallan Singh is my name! He came to my turf and ruined my name. Claiming Lallan is a kid, Lallan is a coward. Arjun, what must Lallan ask him? Give him one chance to prove himself! Why are you quiet when this simpleton is insulting you, Lallan? Have you lost your tongue? You’ve ruined our whole name, Lallan? Looking at Lallan like this is making me sad, Arjun! I’ve said it then, I’ll say it now! Lallan… Lallan Singh is my name! I've become cheap to everyone. What happened? What happened? Right here! It’s right here. That George has insulted me right here. I’m telling you right now, brother! He shouldn’t win this election! I’m going home. Lallan is threatening students because he’s not getting anyone’s support in the elections. He’s not even part of our problems. In this situation, any obstacle is a big problem to us. The Police have cut the power to the the campus We should have Rajanna go to Delhi University and calm this debacle down! George, be careful, okay? Okay Mom. if anybody does anything arrest them. Who are you? leave me i will see your end. Hey Murthy, is it Rajanna? where did you get him ...? On the way to the canteen. hey give me that… son of a ..... hit him, hit him harder. hey leave me i will see your end. who are you?. ok sir, hit him, hit him harder. Leave me if you have guts. he got lots of attitude take him to warangal jail. hold him tight he is a dangerous guy. what is the reason for calling me..? I heard about your fight. If you join us our fight will get much more better. Srikaakulam farmer protest is my inspiration. I am doing the same thing by staying with people. Tomorrow you might take my path or I might take your path. but my fight is in very good shape. laal salaam. laal salaam. You use guns to fire after George's death. I heard 1200 people died fighting for your problems. What did you gain out of it? Is this George's gun. Yes. Why does a student leader need a gun? if george used this gun the history would have been something else. Can I keep it? Anyways I believe you don't need anymore, So... Thankyou. Muskan.. What are you going to gain out of this documentry? We can change history. Let's go... I will take leave mother. Food...

"Fight every step of the way for your right!" sir, its very difficult to control this George. if he announces meeting thousand's of people are coming. he will get support from every university to make the riots happen. If this one campus students behaves in this way, then what about the situation of the whole nation. eventhough he is a good man one day he will stumble on law & order one day.
