You’re the one with good taste -Indeed! I swear you, if he comes by this time… Luca That’s what he wants… Let’s leave! C'mon... Why don’t you sue him? Who? - C’mon! Luca, my mom is a friend of his parents. And we played together as children… I don’t want to... Don’t seem like good reasons to me Listen, there’s no need to make a fuss about this We leave and they stop bothering us. That’s it! I fucking hate it. Hey - I saw you tried to call me… I was talking to my mother, I’m sorry! Tell me everything - Those sons of bitches have been arrested The doctor told me that if there’s no more hemorrhage he will have surgery and something will happen What will happen? - He said it could go well but we must be prepared for the worst - What’s the 'worst'?

Rachele, will you let me stay one minute with him, please? Will you leave me a sec... - ...and I really can’t understand What’s wrong with you today? You don’t wanna tell me? I couldn’t talk. Can you believe it? I was on the stage and I couldn’t talk. Something like that never happened to me before You know what you gotta do? You gotta stop thinking about me... and you gotta focus then you’ll make the audience fly. Riki please don’t hang up! Wait a second! Riki, please... wait! - Tell me mum... Any news? - No news...I have no news... Listen.. I thought I can go and talk with Luca’s mother at the hospital - We are mothers, we are women, maybe in such a hard moment... Oh really?! ‘Cause maybe they’ll tell you in which hospital he is. Give me his sister’s number I’ll call her! Mum please! Forget about it! -Forget about it...forget about it... Riki, people can change, when facing such a big pain -No mum, people don’t change. They don’t change! That’s the way they are! I’ve been begging his sister to know where he is and she didn’t tell me anything. The only thing she told me is that their mother is in shock. OK?? -That’s all she told me. Then you let me come to your place I’ll cook you something and we stay together. Answer me, fuck! - Riki, you're driving me crazy like this. I can’t imagine you all by yourself in this situation and pretend like it's nothing Please, Riki Mum, I'll call you, OK? if there's any news I’ll call you! - Listen please... Fuck it! - Can we pay rent for this place every month? Who knows? In any case I can always use my talent… People like it… It’s a best-seller -You’re such an idiot! Hey! Megan Fox!! I heard you wanna be an actress Your mouth smells like shit with all that cock sucking Hey, hey! I’m talking to you! It really bothers me....when people pretend they’re not hearing me and you can’t afford that, with that fuck face! Right, you cock-sucker? Uh? Isn’t it right, you cock-sucker? Mum, I told you I was gonna call you! - I know, but I’m worried. I know you told me not to worry and to take care of me. Actually, you know what I’m doing? Riki... I’m doing a face mask. The one with pure collagen you and Luca got me. When I’ll take that off nobody will recognize me I’ll be twenty years younger! - Riki Yeah mum, I’m here. You have all the rights to see him, because you are the person he loves. I’m sure she’s not mad at you. - If you were a woman she wouldn’t behave any different. Maybe it would have been a bit easier to accept, but the problem is that mothers struggle to let you guys leave… She’s just jealous of the love he feels for you. Riki… Riki… - Niguarda ER speaking Hello, I need an information... - Go ahead Some hours ago my brother should have been arrived, his name is Luca Di Matteo - Let me give a look. My shift just started - No! I’m sorry we have no patient under that name. - Do you know why he’s been brought here? No… No, no, no. Because... because the situation is complicated - Somebody should have called you, I guess. Try to contact your local police department. I’m sure they will know something. Thank you. - This is just memory rehearsal, do not judge me, - Fine No, no! Ok? - Go.. I know, I know! But Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. Yes, it is true, when that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept. Ambition should be made of harder stuff. -Yet... Sterner stuff - Sterner stuff Yet... Yet... Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. Yes... it is true! You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which Caesar did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? OK, try to make it again. Try to focus What did you say? - Focus and do it again But don’t look at me like this A little of… Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me. But Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. Yes, it is true, when that the poor have cried Riki -Yes. Look at me, no? Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me. But Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept. Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet... Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Yet Brutus...? - Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, Yet Brutus says he was ambitious... - And, sure, he is an honorable man. And, sure, he is an honorable man. -Good - It was good! I should still work on it - You look cute with the sheet -Yeah… Do I look good? - You look good! Riccardo, I’ll call you back in a minute. Sorry! You are so hot. A real man. It’s exactly the same thing my mum told me my first day of work Do you know why I fell in love with you? Can I tell you without you getting upset No, I’m not gonna tell you. You’re gonna get upset If you know I get upset then don’t tell me otherwise I’m gonna get really upset Why you look at me like this? You know my mum left me in a foster home. She brought me there, bum, like that. She told me she was gonna pick me up... but she never did... She told me that I had to be patient, that she would have come to get me. But the next day her sister came with the husband I’ve stayed ten years with them and for ten years she didn’t even call me. Nothing Of course, every once in a while she showed up, she covered me with gift, she cried and then she left. What about your dad? - My dad? My mum has no fucking clue who’s my dad! Of course, she says we look alike that sooner or later we’re gonna see each other ...that he is fine, we’re gonna meet. But it’s never gonna happen. This is never gonna happen. It doesn’t really hurt anymore. I moved on. I overcame this thing. Just wanted you to know... That my mum changed men as much as she changed rehab places. Not bad. So many surprises. I wonder what you’re gonna tell me in a month. And I thought I had issues with my mother... In any case I want you to know... that I prefer your mother You think I suck? No, I don't! - Tell me Yeah, tell me I suck… We… are gonna get old together. Don’t forget that! - Please don’t hang up, just tell me how he is! We are waiting for the attending to know the results of last exam They say we will know better... after this. - You know he talked me about you, the two of you… He said we were gonna meet The same to me... He... ...he often talked about you. Riccardo, are you still there? - Yes, yes, I’m... ...I'm here! Go on. - Isn't this unfair? Out there is full of assholes who have no idea of what to do... while my brother is fighting between life and death. Do you think this is fair? The attending is coming! Wait, I’ll call you back Riccardo! Unfortunately the exam caused another bleeding and it is very hard to foresee anything at this moment. What does it mean ‘the exam caused another bleeding’? Then, why did you do that? It was necessary... and you signed the disclaimer. But you didn’t warn us… No one told us anything about this. It’s not fair… Dad, It's not fair... There was no other choice, unfortunately... And now? I would say to wait for the moment and... in few hours we will know what to do. I am sorry, I am really sorry How do we tell mum? We don’t… just say he’s still in medically induced coma I could have hugged him and I’ve never done it… I’ve been taught like this Dad, don’t do like this! What if mum sees you… I’m sorry, you’re right - When will you take me to church? And you swear eternal love in front of everybody? I don’t know when... I know there’s no need to swear eternal love in front of everybody. just in front of God... Could be enough for me. Do you think we could be faithful? No... You know I love you! I love you too Then why you say we can’t? Because we are young Everything can change ‘Everything changes but change itself’ And I didn’t say that, Heraclitus did. You are an asshole, Luca. Such an asshole I'm here! - He had another bleeding What does it mean? I don’t know Riccardo what it means. I’m not a doctor. I don’t know. I can’t stay here. I need to see him! I need to see him I can’t stay here. - Riccardo, no! Riccardo Please! Riccardo you understand my mum think it’s all your fault? that if Luca was home nothing of this would have happened? Your mother is really heartless No, Riccardo my mother is not heartless. She is just a judgmental woman and she thinks you are just a pervert who seduced her son. - Give me a break for once! What am I supposed to do? - You’d rather me to lie? I’d rather. There’s no need to be so sincere. Every time telling the truth about everything. That was the deal, no? Always the truth. No hypocrisy. Your deal! The deal you accepted - No I mean yes, I accepted, but... ...but I didn’t accepted Jesus Christ, Riki! Riki, I’m the one with the churchy family Your mum is a hippie, you wanna be an artist. You should be the most open minded person in the world. I told you nothing will change our love! In any case, fine... ...next time I won’t tell you. There will be no next time! You understand? ‘Cause I’m gonna kill you. I’ll kill you Luca! Seriously! I'll kill you! Riki, Riki, Riki, Riki please don’t ruin everything with this obsession! I’m sorry Riccardo I’ve been such a bitch, I never took his side. - I never said a word. I wonder what you think about me. You can speak freely. Luca taught me very well. He started insulting me since he started speaking. When he picked on you, it was over. - You know... all his quick answers? How the fuck he did, only God knows. The best one was when he came back from a journey I think it was Tunisia. Did he ever tell you? My aunt asked him how was the trip and he replied very gently he returned ‘extra-virgin’. Since she didn’t understand he said he had been ‘squeezed under an olive tree’. Can you believe it? Dad got mad and grabbed him by the neck while my mum was crying. And you know what he said when it was over? That we all could use a nice trip to Tunisia. Luca is like this About me? What did he say? Do you really want to know? - Sure! Ok...Well... He said that... you were not great in bed, that your size is barely acceptable ...but you are crazy enough to keep him close Son of a bitch! - He was kind of obsessed. Every time somebody came home he looked over there, between the legs to know how big was... the tool Hammed, I’m leaving. All right dear! Go! So how did it go? I stink! Can’t you smell? I missed you today You too Interesting! I thought about you all day Me too. Even more interesting I had a boner all day thinking about you The same So original! And then? Then what? Don’t ask me what I’ve done today? What have you done? I’ve done some thinking, I thought that if you want... we can get a room...No, a house! This neighborhood is a shit, but rents are cheap Watch your language, I grew up here! Your hair look so shitty today You don’t look so good either I’m starting to know how it works with you! Which is? I heard from Riccardo… He’s asking whether he can come to visit I think it would be fair, Luca would be really upset I don’t care! Mum, just think about it I don’t care! What did you expect? - Exactly this Then why did you do that? - How can't you understand. These could be his last momentsand you wanna deny him something he wanted. How the fuck can you do that? I don’t understand you But your mother… - It’s not about mother. Dad, can you make a fucking decision for once in your life? If you think it’s fair, go, please, and convince mum! Dad, dad look at me! It’s your last chance to accept your son for what he is. Dad... Thanks dad. You’ve always been a giant! Please! He gave me him and now... He wants to take him back I birthed him… I don’t want… I don’t want he takes him Calm down… You'll see, everything will be all right! Everything! I hate you! I curse the day I married you. I curse everybody I curse everybody, I curse everybody Don’t say those things. Hi Riki, sweetheart! - Hi aunt! - How are you? Everything all right? May I speak to uncle Emilio? - Uncle Emilio is in the bathroom. I’ll call him right away. Hold a moment. Emilio - Yes? Riki here! Riki? - Riki! Hello Hello, hi Riki! - How are you? Can you leave alone for a moment? Riki, something happened to your mum? - Listen, you called me. Can you explain, please? I remembered last time we played together And... what does it mean? - Riki! - All right, in five minutes everything should be ready. Well... Set up the operating room and please notify the doctor OK. All right! - Everything ready in five minutes We decided to operate Riki, let’s go home, c’mon! It’s cold! - Come It’s important! Can you tell me why we are here? You promised to marry me. C’mon Riki it’s very nice here but let’s go… Say yes! Really? Yes! Yes And you? Yes - Uncle Emilio just called me, he was scared he thought something happened to me. Riki... Do you have any news? Why did you call uncle Emilio and not me? Do you really wanna know? Riki what’s that tone? Nothing, mum. I was just telling you why I called... Your sister’s husband, that’s all! - Riki, did you take something? No mum, I didn’t take anything! Listen, let's do like this... I take the car and I pick you upand we go and check all Milan's hospitals until we find him. - No No mum I don’t wanna see him anymore! - Don’t say like this, you make me worry, Riki! - Enough, mum! Enough! Enough!! I can’t take it anymore! You all gotta fuck yourself! You understand? Fuck his parents, his sister, you... -...uncle Emilio. Fuck you all! I’m sorry mum! - Don’t apologize. You are right Riki. I’ve always been immature. I’m sorry I didn't wanna leave you alone I didn’t mean to abandon you. - Sometimes in life bad things happen. You don’t know how to react. But it has nothing to do with you You shouldn’t be worried about that, your son is an adult! You shouldn't feel guilty Now we get up... ...we take a shower... ...and than... I’ll take you to his place ...or wherever you want to. So you calm down Hey? Are you listening to me? I should feel guilty instead. I really should. You should also break up with me. Why are you with a woman like me? Can’t you see the way you look at me? And how do I look at you? I like you! I... like... you! Leave it! No shower? Don’t touch me! Rachele... Now I want you to tell me where he is! No, Riccardo! I can’t! It’s my parents and they have the right to think the way they want to Rachele… - They raised me, they loved me and if something would hurt them I'll try my best to protect them. Luca loves them too. Do you think his life started right after he met you? - Riccardo leave us alone. We’ve got worst things to take care of. You are so beautiful, mum! In velvet! You know... they wouldn’t eat dad alive They are regular people like you You fool. In any case I didn’t send your dad away, he decided to leave. Come here! - Wait! Come here! What? It’s the first time I’m really in love… I would like you to smile Can we not talk about that? Fine I feel violated. You know? It’s them! Hello! Hi Luca! - Hi! Good morning, how are you? Please... Fine, thanks! This way Luca, are you sure? - I don’t think it’s a good idea Yes it is. You stay here, now! She'll get used to Mum, I’m coming to help. So mum, what should we do? May I tell you one thing? I already know what you wanna tell me. Then why are you still torturing me? Torturing you! How would you feel if someone tells you that are disgusting? I said that thinking about two men making love is disgusting to me. That's what I said! Am I allowed to say that I’m not happy knowing that you are in love with another man? That’s not what I was expecting from your life, you know… Yes mum! I completely understand! Hi, aunt, it’s Riki - Ah Riki! Can I speak with uncle? - I’m uncle’s secretary today He’s right in front of me, here! Bye sweetie Hello Riki How are you? I spoke with your mum and she told me what happened and.. - I want you to know that I'm sure everything will be all right. Let me know if there’s something I can do and I will! You know I’ve always been there for you. I need to see you. Why don’t you come over? Where are you? - What did you wanna tell me? Come with me. What’s up, eh? What’s up? I don’t like it anymore, you son of a bitch! I’m too old?! - Enough! Enough what? I say 'enough'! Stop it! Mister Savino? -Yes? Your son is inside. I’ll be right back Look me in the face! Stop it, dad! Stop! You are an asshole! You’re an asshole! You're... Tell me Hello Riccardo Why don’t you come over here... Let’s make a deal If you put...your tongue in my mouth... and you reach my esophagus and you make me shiver... then I’m gonna tell you something important. What if I can’t make it? Just try! I can always… reward your efforts. So? - My heart is breaking saying this… But I... ...I never wanted him. Never. And he always felt that. - Even now, I’m not crying for him, but for me… because I feel inadequate. If you hadn’t love him you wouldn’t talk like this. And... you know... after all I have to thank you because you gave me the chance to feel like a mother - even... if for a short time… but when he was here with us... ...we loved him. - Yes
