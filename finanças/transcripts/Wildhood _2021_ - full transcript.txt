- Get the front. Don't miss a spot. - Pepperoni! Pepperoni! Pepperoni! Bacon! Cheese... Yes. (distant barking) (chuckling) (clanging) (clinking) (squeaking) (engine sputtering) - It's not turning! (siren whooping) - Hey. - Shit! - Hey, stop! - Run! - Hey! - No! Let go of me! - Hands behind your back! (groaning) - Let me go! - Hey, don't you touch him! I'll fucking kill you! - Shut up! - Let go of him! (grunting) (humming softly) (humming) (humming) (distant shouting) (humming) (speaking Mi'kmaw) (speaking Mi'kmaw) (distant shouting) (speaking Mi'kmaw) (speaking Mi'kmaw) (footsteps) (clanging) - That's enough. Keep back. (door squeaking) You get five minutes with the next one. (squeaking) (clanging) (distant shouting) (footsteps) (keys jingling) - Get up. Let's go. Travis. Let's go. Come here, Goldilocks! - Holy shit - What is this? - You want everybody to think you're a fruit, huh? - No. - Is that what it is? - No. - What have I been telling you about starting on a job before you get the all-clear? - You were just gonna make us do it anyway! - Well, now the cops are watching the place, aren't they? (Link groaning) Huh? You can say goodbye to that goddamn bike. - You can't do that! I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do! Travis go outside and play. (indistinct chatter) (Link groaning) Get outside and play! - Okay, I'm sorry! Come here. Get over here. Stand up! Stand up like a fuckin' man for once. Come on. (Link groaning) (distant barking) (indistinct chatter) (clattering) (groaning) (birdsong) (splashing) - Wrench. - There. Link. - Screwdriver. (indistinct chatter) - Can you fix it? - I'm trying. - What do you need? It's uncle Dale. Uncle Dale! - Hey, bud! - Ah! (Dale laughing) - How you doing? Good? - Yeah. - Got you boys something. C'mere. Check it out. - What'd you get? - Hop up. - Holy shit! - Hey, watch your mouth. - So big. - Pretty neat, huh? - Yeah. (TV playing) - You're gonna have nightmares watching this. - Am not. It's not even scary. - Move over. (clatter) Get off. - Sit on the other couch. (Travis chuckling) (Dale groaning) - Mm. Bedtime, Trav. - But Link gets to stay up. - Link'll be right behind ya. - But it's only 9:30. - I don't care what time it is. It's bedtime. Get on, brush your teeth. (wind blowing) (screaming on TV) Move it, ya slug, you wanna go? Huh? I mean it. (Travis laughing) (door creaking and closing) You got your eye on anyone at school? Oh, come on. Gotta be some girl you got the hots for. Or someone. Lincoln-- (clatter) - Fucking cat around the house. Better not be no one feeding that fucking cat. I'll skin it. Hey. Where you going? - Bed, sir. - Well, look at ya. - I gotta brush my teeth. - Go on. What're you looking at? Travis! - Trav. - What? - Soup. Here. Put these in the bag. Let's go. - No, go away! Don't touch me. (laughing) That's what you get! (owl hooting) My feet hurt. Wish we still had the bike. - We'll get it back. - How? (footsteps) (door closing) - What'd I tell you about slamming that fucking door? Hey! Hey! Link! Open this fucking door! - Fuck you! - Get outta my room! Come on out, Link! Right now! - Where'd you hide the key?! - Link! You hear me? C'mere or I'll cut every fuckin' last little blond hair off your head. I'll shave it off. You hear me?! (pounding on door) Open this fuckin' door right now! (shouting) (Travis): Stop! - You get back! You want some too?! (shouting) (woman humming) - You said she was dead! - She's dead. I said she was dead, she's dead. She's dead to me, she's dead to you. You understand? She was dead the day she left this fuckin' house, alright? You got it? She don't want ya. (scoffing) What, are you gonna ball like some pansy? Don't fucking push me! I'll give ya to the count of five to get back in this fucking house! - What's going on? Did you find-- - Give me a piece of wood! Hurry up! - Okay! (pounding on door) - Get in. - Open this door! (distant barking) Link! - Look! - You looking for these? - He's got the keys. - Get out. - What are you doing in my car? Get outta that truck! Get over here and open this door! Travis! Right now unless you get over and unlock this front door. Yeah, come on. Come on. Listen here, fuck. You think I roughed you up the other night? Link? What the fuck do you think you're doing? Travis, get the fuck over and open this door! Don't you dare. Link, I'm warning you! If I have to fuckin' crawl out through this window... Link, don't! Jesus Christ! (Travis): Link, c'mon! (Arvin shouting) What're we gonna say when we go back? - We're not going back. (woman singing softly) (country music playing) - You into dirt bikes? What's your favourite ride? - Let's go. No, we don't have enough money. - Come on, I'm hungry. - Saw you with a magazine over there. - So? (scoffing) I didn't steal shit. - Calm down. - Well, fuck you! - Your parents know where you are? Hey! (door closing) - Hey. Racist prick. Here. - My candy! - Are you Micmac? Link's Micmac. - No, I'm not. Trav, come on. (speaking Mi'kmaw) - What'd you just say? (speaking Mi'kmaw) - Yeah? (laughing) - Shit. You got issues. - Yeah, well, we don't need your help. - Couldn't tell. - Hey! I'm ready to call the cops! - Shit. C'mon! - All of yas, get outta here! (engine starting) - Come on! - You got names? - Travis. - I'm Pasmay. (rap music playing) - Buzz-a-what? - Pasmay. It's Mi'kmaw. - I gotta take a piss. - Use this. - Alright, we could've... ...stopped and pulled over, but sure. (clearing throat) (Travis urinating) Holy shit, kid, when's the last time you went? - Shit, that's my dad! (Link and Travis): Drive! Drive! - Come on. (honking) (Travis): He's gaining on us! Go! - Pass me the cup. - Take it! - The lid! The lid! - Go, go, go! Link, be careful! - Fuck you! (honking) (laughter) - My God! It was like an explosion! You nailed it! - Faster! - This is as fast as she goes! - Okay. - God, that was insane! (rap music blaring) - What're you doing? - What the hell was that?! - Drive! He's gonna catch up! (turning off engine and music) (chuckling) Trav, let's go. Hurry up! - So that's it? Hijack my truck to escape some maniac in a beater then walk off into the sunset? - We never asked for your help! - So I keep hearing. Yet my wheels, my pop bottle... - What, you looking for a fucking medal or something?! - You even know where you're going? There's not a town for miles that way! There's a campground, like, 20 minutes up the road! I have food! - What? (sighing) Alright. Hurry up. Here, put your arms out. - I got some. - Put your arms out like this. (indistinct chatter) Let's go. Dude, that's... That's fucked up. - Whatever. - No, for real. That's a huge mind-fuck. Your dad's a psycho. - Travis, go to bed. - But you get to stay up. - I'm older. - And uglier. - Ha-ha. Go. Go! What's all that? - Regalia. For dancing. - At a club? - At a mawiomi. - A mawiomi? A powwow. You never been to a powwow? Well, around this time of year, there's a bunch of them. A good dancer can make a bit of cash. - You any good? - Been dancing since I was four. My dad used to make me go to all the powwows, growing up. - So he... taught you or whatever? - So what's the plan with you guys? - Hitchhike the rest of the way tomorrow. - Better grab some sleep, then. - Pasmay? Can you say something in Micmac? - It's "Mi'kmaw." - Well, what's "dog"? (speaking Mi'kmaw) - Say "I'm the strongest." (speaking Mi'kmaw) - How about "candy"? (speaking Mi'kmaw) (Travis whispering): "Kahn-dee." - How about "raccoon"? (speaking Mi'kmaw) - "Ama-gee-wedge." - Enough. - One more? - No. (speaking Mi'kmaw) (speaking Mi'kmaw) (Mi'kmaw) - Yeah, no. (birdsong) (bird cawing) - So... I was thinking about hitchhiking and... Take your time. - We're gone as soon as Travis is up. - Thinking about maybe I could give you guys a ride. - We don't got gas money or anything. - No, it's cool. (banging on truck) - Wakey, wakey! - I'm tired. - Ugh. You need a bath. - Shut up. - You both do. You smell like ass. (up-tempo music) (music fading) (exclamation) - What's that? My candy! (Pasmay laughing) - I guess that's his candy now. - Do something! - I can't sing the goddamn colours of the wind to it. Dude, it'll bite you! - Then I'll bite back! (laughter) (shouting in Mi'kmaw) (laughing) Whoo! (rap music) For the record we gon' make it There's lots of drama on the rez But I'm different and God says I'm supposed to take it (rap music) Say my grace I'm not religious but love what they gave me I'm too focused on success I'm never growing shady Not quitting till I'm old and gray We unlock the code and now we gonna explode Get a Lambo or Mercedes I'm getting' paid Pile of success Walk miles just to figure out what to invest I'm blessed but now I gotta figure out what really matters So I gotta take the bigger ounce of reality Equip yourself A lot of people give up and rather just live in hell Never did sit too well with me I got places to go Livin' my vision earning my fame on the road Dreamcatchers Don't even hint to quit You know I'll keep rappin' I'm a beast at this Only... is to wreak havoc Flows contagious and people breathe that in Forget your weak whack trends I got no keys but I'm in Piece and I'm in - Yes? - Uh... I'm looking for, uh... Sarah. - Huh. I'm afraid you've got the wrong address. - She might've moved. - She's my mother. - And what was the name again? Sugar? - So what is this place, exactly? - Well, we provide a safe, substance-free environment for people to heal in, find themselves when they're lost. - It's rehab. - Well, we do more than that, but yes, that's part of it. We provide guidance to those that need it, but unfortunately, Sarah went in a different direction. - What's that mean? - She chose to... to hold on to beliefs and traditions that were problematic. Combined with her choice of employer, well... it couldn't be overlooked. - So you kicked her out for, what, burning sage and sweetgrass? - Well, this was a mistake. - No. - You know, it was many years ago now, but I was so sorry to hear of your mother's passing. - You knew my mom? - Oh, yes. And your dad. It was your dad who asked me to take Lincoln's mother in as a favour. - I need to find her. You said she had a job or something. - Well, I understand, but I cannot provide personal information, even if you are family. Have you talked to Arvin? - This is such bullshit! She's my mom! Why can't you just tell me?! - C'mon. She's not gonna help. - Can we go? - So noble of you. - We went all that way for nothing! - I wanna play a game. - Thanks, I guess. For helping. - Hey... don't pay attention to what she said. I'm pretty sure your mom's totally fine. Family's overrated anyway. I got, like, three sisters and I can't spend more than a day with them. Maybe an hour with my mom. - Why? - Well... me and her don't really get along. She thinks that the devil has many tricks and I'm one of them. Ah, shit. Pull over. Try it now. (engine stalling) - So how you gonna get to the next powwow? - I don't think I'll make it in time. (Travis): So what now? - Well... We could wander aimlessly through the bushes and get eaten by bears and mosquitoes. - Pass. - Scooch over? Or... check this out. - What is this? - For someone who likes to keep shit private, she should really learn how to use a lock. - Did you steal that? - There's an address. I think this is it. - Lemme see. - That's, like... How far is that? - Couple days on foot. - I don't wanna walk for two whole days! - We'll hitchhike. Or steal some horses. - You're coming with us? - Well, I don't wanna deprive my biggest fan of my singing voice. - Come on, Link. Are we really gonna ride horses? - Nah, he was kidding. Right? Bet you can't balance on this. - Watch your step there, boy. - Hey! (bird-like sound) How are you doing that? - Alright, teach me. - See... that L shape right there? - Okay. - Close it with your left hand. - Mm-hmm. - And, uh, you blow into this, into the thumbs. (Pasmay speaking Mi'kmaw) Okay. So... We'll start... with the basic step. Your left foot goes up. And when you hop on your right foot, your left foot hits the ground. And try to do it to one, two, three, four, then switch your other foot. And so, one, two, three, four. Switch. One, two, three; lift up your arms like an eagle. There you go. Now do this. (laughter) There you go! (laughter) Told you it was easy. You're an eagle. Now do this. (laughter) - You look like a douchebag. (Travis laughing) - What's your problem? (birdsong) - Are your parents still together? - She'll never divorce him. He goes on a bender and beats the shit out of us, but she won't say a word. As long as he's sober for church. - But she threw you out. - Dude. - Love has conditions, I guess. (birdsong) I think this is it. - Definitely a murder house. - Oh, come on. (creaking) (wind blowing) (door creaking) (Travis): It's huge. (wind blowing) (creaking) (creaking) (humming) (humming) (woman singing softly) (woman singing softly) - If she ran away... ...why didn't she take me with her? (birdsong) - Uh, Link? (flies buzzing) What do you think happened to it? - Car hit it maybe. Crawls here from the road. We say... (in Mi'kmaw): - "Misquit nokoma." (speaking Mi'kmaw) (making sounds) Stop. See that barb on the end? That sticks in you and then when you take it out, it tears you up. - I've seen a porcupine quill before. I'm not stupid. - Looking a little wet there, kwis. (in Mi'kmaw): Like willows on a lake To lie within the din Of a love that we could make - Introductions. Name's John. People call me Smokey. (chuckling) Other people, they call me crazy. (in Mi'kmaw): (in English): I'm Link. The brat in the back is Travis. - Hey! (in Mi'kmaw): (in English): What are these? (whispering): Don't touch. - Let him look. - Oh! It's a cake! - I'm a pastry chef. French-trained. Studied at Le Cordon Bleu in "Paree." (speaking Mi'kmaw) - Where we going? - Doesn't matter. - Tell you what. You help me with an errand, then maybe we can sit down, eat something warm. You know that cake in the back? I need some help surprising my family with it. How about it, blondie? You up for it? - What do I gotta do? - Just go in and keep whoever's inside distracted for five minutes. Sneak around back, drop off the cake, then we split. I'm counting on you, kwis. Don't let me down. I'll be fine. Watch over Trav while I'm gone. Be back in a sec. (rap music playing) Hello? Niskam! Holy fuck, look at your hair, bro! (speaking Mi'kmaw) Don't think you came into my store just to gawk at me like that. - What? No. Fuck, no. - Who the fuck are you to give me attitude in my own store? Look at you. You look like you got a bowl of Kraft Dinner sitting on top your head. All you're missing is those hotdogs and you got yourself a rez delicacy sitting on that empty kunji of yours. You know what? I got something for you to fix up that Eminem, Slim Shady days bullshit. (kid speaking Mi'kmaw) - I don't know Mi'kmaw! - I said your momma! Okay. Now, personally, I think you should grow your hair out, because I think it'll be a nice look. However, you should learn your language while you're at it. - What is this? - It's hair dye. - I don't have any money. - I didn't ask for your money, njiknam. (clattering) (speaking Mi'kmaw) (in Mi'kmaw): (in English): Who was working at the counter? - Some dyke in a plaid shirt. (Smokey shouting in Mi'kmaw) That was my nephew. - Sorry. I didn't know. - Well, now you do. Lucky he didn't hear you. He'd bust your head. He's small, but those raccoon hands of his are more unforgiving than his attitude. (laughing) (speaking Mi'kmaw) Bet you he gave you trouble about your hair. I went blond back in the day, believe it or not. Nephew hated it. Wouldn't talk to me for a week. - So you sent me in there to get yelled at? (laughing) (rock music playing) - Link. You got a... little something there. - How do you say "thank you"? (speaking Mi'kmaw) (speaking Mi'kmaw) What's this sticker from? (speaking Mi'kmaw) It's not for kids. - My mom might work there. Can you take us? (dance music playing) - Stay here. Don't touch anything. Don't touch anyone. - I don't like it here. (whispering): Shut up. (in Mi'kmaw): (in English): Okay, come on. - Alright... let's go. - I'm staying here. - What? - I'm staying here. - I'll keep an eye on him. (knocking) (in Mi'kmaw): (in English): If it isn't my favourite cakemaker. - Come on. (in English): This is Mother Mary, the owner of the bar. (in English): I liked Sarah. Very proud, that woman. I'm not sure she'd want to be found. - I don't care about this confidential information bullshit. I'm not going anywhere until you tell me something. You must have something. An address. Records. Anything! (in English): Blow. For what it's worth... ...I know the name of the community where she comes from. - So tell me! Please. - Blanket Hill. - Well, that's where I'm going. - Maybe you kids should stick around. There's a hotel up the road. Alright. At least take this. - I can't. - Take it. Try to stay out of trouble. (speaking Mi'kmaw) - Trav, come on. - Hey, why don't we all just go, you know, grab a bite? (barking) - Hey, what's your problem? You're acting like a dick. - Why'd you even bring me? You just yell at me all the time and make me carry everything. - I'm looking out for you. - You were just too chickenshit to be on your own. You don't need me now anyways. - It's not like-- - I seen how he looks at you. I'm not stupid. I know you guys wanna be boyfriends or whatever. - How long have we been brothers? - I don't know. - Since you were born, dumbass. - Shut up. (chuckling) - Ow. I'm not going anywhere without you. Okay? - He likes you. - Whatever. - I'm serious. He wants to do it with you I bet. - Okay, shhh-shhh. What do you want? Want a real bed? Why don't we get a hotel room? - I want pizza. - Fine. - And beer. - Don't push it. (Travis chuckling) (TV playing) (uplifting music) (up-tempo music) What are you doing? - Going for a swim. - It's freezing. - What are you, chicken? (exclaiming) (laughter) (laughing) (grunting) You okay? - Yeah. - You sure? - Everything okay? Fuck. - I'm fine. Was that... You've done that before? - Not like that. I liked it. I'm just... I dunno. Say something. In the language. I like to hear it. (in Mi'kmaw): (Link): You've been to Blanket Hill before? (Pasmay): Maybe. Don't really remember. (Link): I thought you went everywhere for powwows and stuff. (Pasmay): I go lots of places. Hard to keep track. - I'm calling my uncle. - Why? - So he can help us. - How do you know you can trust him? What if he just takes you home? - He wouldn't do that. - How can you be sure? - What's your problem? (Pasmay speaking Mi'kmaw) My problem? You're obsessed with finding someone that doesn't want to be found. - You don't know shit. - Link. - She didn't want you then, what makes you think she'll want you now? - Just 'cause your mom threw you out for being a cocksucker doesn't mean mine is the same. Wait here. (in Mi'kmaw): (repeating) - Fucking move! You know... I got three nephews I never met. Probably never will. My family thinks I'm a monster. When my... When my mom found out about me... ...wanna know what she said? Her heart was made of wood and there was no room for me anymore. Thought my sisters would be different, but... (sniffling) ...that's family. - At least now you're free to go anywhere you want. No one to... hold you back or... ...tell you you're stupid. You're free. - Free. Free to do what? (sniffling) You don't know how lucky you are that you got someone chasing after you. That you got somewhere you're going. - I'm sorry I called you-- - I've heard worse. - Still not cool. Especially after we-- - Yeah. Yeah. - Look. (chuckling) Travis has one eye. I'm a fake blond. And you secretly snore at night. (chuckling) See, now it's all out in the open. (laughing) (Link laughing) - I don't snore. - Yes, you do. - I don't. (Link laughing) - How do you say "mother"? (speaking Mi'kmaw) Nkwis is "son." "Your son." - Careful, careful! (exclamations and laughter) There you go. There's an echo, Trav. (howling) (echoing) (Pasmay speaking Mi'kmaw) (Link speaking Mi'kmaw) (Mi'kmaw) - Is this it? I think this is it. We actually found it. (in Mi'kmaw): (in English): You got family up there. Maybe this faggot's your cousin. (speaking Mi'kmaw) Take your shoes off before you come in. - I saw you. At the jail. - I saw you coming. (speaking Mi'kmaw) - D'you have a dream or something? - No, but my driveway is very long. (laughing) (speaking Mi'kmaw) (Mi'kmaw) Go get cleaned up and take a shower, and Antle will lend you some clothes. (Mi'kmaw) - Uh... Special delivery. - Watch yourself. - I think I'm done this one. - Looks good. Hey, little man. I don't think we need... (indistinct chatter) - ...in the oven. You can just put it in with the other... the other bowl. - Yeah. - It's good. - Eat it. - No. - Why not? - It's gross. - No, it isn't. - Yes, it is. - Try it. - You're gonna have to eat it. - Try it. Come on! - Eat it! (indistinct chatter) - Try it. - I triple dog dare you. - I got one. I got one. What happens when a frog parks illegally? He gets toad. - Oh, my... (laughter) (indistinct chatter) - ...in a trailer park. (laughter) (speaking Mi'kmaw) They're hard to tell even when you sort them out. (speaking Mi'kmaw) (Mi'kmaw) Does this look like the sky or the... ocean? To me, they look the same. (speaking Mi'kmaw) Once you got them on, then you know where they belong. - And what if they don't fit anywhere? - That's how your mother felt. She felt like she didn't belong. (speaking Mi'kmaw) When she was born, we thought there was something mad with her, 'cause she was so quiet. But... she worried about the people, 'cause... she thought that they were sad. And she would pick flowers for them on the side of the road. She had a big heart. Yeah. And Elaine, too. You're just like that. It's a good gift. And sometimes it's hard when you carry it by yourself. (speaking Mi'kmaw) It's hard to do things alone. (Mi'kmaw) Let's go for a walk. C'mon. Let's go for a walk. (Mi'kmaw) (birdsong) (woman shouting in Mi'kmaw) (in Mi'kmaw): (humming) (Sarah singing softly) (singing softly) - Nkwis. My boy. My son. (Link sniffling) (crying) (sobbing) - He told me you were dead. I didn't even know you were alive. That's all I wanted to know. Who you are. Why didn't want me. - You're so big. And handsome. (Link laughing) (sniffling) (Sarah chuckling) I remember the first time that I held you. You were so little. You fit right in my arms. I was running. Your father... he tried to keep things together. - I thought you were running from him. (speaking Mi'kmaw) (sniffling) Shame. For who I was. For all the things that happened to me. It stays in you like a poison. (speaking Mi'kmaw) - Did you... Did you... ...want... (speaking Mi'kmaw) Do you want to be my mom? (sniffling) (speaking Mi'kmaw) I think somebody's been waiting for you. (in Mi'kmaw): (up-tempo Indigenous music) (music fading) (man): Yes! Yes! (speaking Mi'kmaw) (Mi'kmaw) (wolf howling) (up-tempo music) Wolves don't live by the rules Wolves don't live by the rules
