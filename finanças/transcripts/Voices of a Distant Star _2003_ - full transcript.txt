Out of Service Area There is a word, "world". Until about the time when I was in middle school, I vaguely thought the word meant the area where the signals from my cell would reach. But why is it... My cell never reaches anyone. Hello? Say, isn't anyone there? How far should I go? I'm lonely. Noboru-kun? I'm going home, okay?
