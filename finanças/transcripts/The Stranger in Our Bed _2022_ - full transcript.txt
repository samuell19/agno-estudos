Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Hey, Char. Can we do that one again? I think you look a bit frightened. Ugh, Tom. Please, please, please, please. The light is gorgeous here. You look gorgeous here. Get the flower up. Put it in front. Nice. Oh, fuck. Why don't you just get a digital one? Developing is part of the fun. Where have you been? You're late. Yeah, the tube was packed. You should have got a taxi. I did in the end. Yeah, let me. Nice flower. Yeah, I got it for the arrangement. I need a shower. Bon appetite. It's nice, getting dressed up with nowhere to go, isn't it? Tom. Not a bad life, eh? I was thinking that maybe we could try again for a baby tonight. Oh, it's mother. I have to take this. Hey. Sorry about that. Mm, probably shouldn't have any more of this. Tom, I need to tell you something. I'm leaving you. I don't want anything from you. I just, I can't do this anymore. Are you fucking serious? I don't understand. Is this not enough for you? Everything I've given you, everything you've got? It's never been about the money. Who is he? It isn't about anyone else. It's us. It isn't working. It is. It is fucking working! Let's talk tomorrow once you've calmed down. I'll be at the manor if you need me. Hi, it's Ewan's answer phone. Please leave a message. Hey, is Ewan here? Sorry, I don't know anyone by that name. Did he leave? I've lived here for five years. No, we were here just yesterday. I don't think so. May I take your case? How did you meet him? You don't have to be alone in this world, you know. Take a look. You've heard of being catfished? You've been manipulated, Charlotte. Some people are just fucked up. Look. I get it. We were struggling and I wasn't there enough for you. I was always at work and that will change. I will change. But I don't want to lose you. I hope we can get past this. How can you? Because you're my wife. As I said, it's probably my fault anyway. I'm so sorry. We both made mistakes. But that is nice to hear, though. We'll need time. I'll stay in the spare room for now. I love you, Charlotte. I know I keep asking, but please, please, let's run away together. Let's do it. You win. Tonight. Are you serious? Go on, start packing. What? No, I just... I need to do something first, I'm sorry. I knew it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry, I'm stupid. It's my fault. I didn't think it would be serious. Of course I want this, I do. But tomorrow... Oh, come on. Don't do that to me. Look, this is a really big step for me. I've never felt like this before, you know that. It's just, it's just my sister. She'd never forgive me. Sorry, look, I'm going to explain everything soon. Tomorrow. Outside Harrods, 10 a.m. We're really doing this. Yes, we are. Tomorrow. How are you, darling? Good morning, ladies. What can I get for you? Two G and Ts please, just a slice of lemon. Make them doubles. Certainly. So. - I mean- - Where were you going to go? What? You have no family apart from us. We know he can be difficult. But Tom still loves you. Is how I feel important? I've been unhappy for a long time. Well, you didn't look unhappy at all those charity balls. I felt alone. I've given everything up for Tom. Being the wife of a CEO is a job. It can be lonely, and sometimes, we have to make sacrifices, but it has its rewards. Thank you. - There you go. Drink that. It'll make you feel better. I know that life would be a little tricky if he wasn't in it, that's for sure. I'll look out for you. I'm so sorry. I don't know what just happened. When will I see you again? I love you, Charlotte. Are you all right, love? Oh, yes. Is there anyone I can call? No. Hi, it's Ewan's answer phone. Please leave a message. Whoever you are, just stay the fuck away from me. I'm delighted to hear that, and I'm surrounded by a bunch of smiling faces. We will see you very soon. Okay, thank you. Goodbye. We'll celebrate in a second. My wife is here. Hey. - Well done. - Thanks. I was just in town with your mother. Oh, yeah, how did it go? Yeah, she said that we should go to the manor house next weekend, and take some time there. That's great. I know, you've got work. No, no, I'll make it happen. We need to, right? Mhm. And I'll feel safer there. Safer? I feel like someone is following me again. This isn't uni, Charlotte. Of course, you're not taking me seriously. No, no, no, you're right. I'm being insensitive. I'm sorry. Maybe it is all in my head, but it really doesn't feel like it. Look. You're right. What? Sorry, what are you talking about? I needed to know the truth. You weren't there in the morning, so I tracked your phone. You had someone follow me? I had an old friend of my mother's follow you. You asshole! I'm the asshole? You've been cold, distant. I should be the one cheating on you! Oh. Look, I'm sorry. You're right, I shouldn't have done it, but I needed to know. You can understand that, right? Yeah, I can. So who's the man I keep seeing? I don't know. I mean, you're a beautiful woman, Charlotte. People look at you all the time. Sorry. Look, I will be home early tonight. Maybe we can have dinner, and talk about our weekend away? Yeah. It's nice to see you both again. I do love it here. Mhm, peaceful. It's just Stefan. Culling season. I asked him to. Of course. I sometimes forget you own this place. Well, it feels like mother does. My father's will says she can live here if she wishes. It will always feel like Isadora's house. You'll feel differently when you're lady of the manor. Oh, what's this? Mother plants fresh bulbs for spring every year. That's nice. Yeah, stand there. New memories. Let's get a selfie. Okay. Smile. Perfect. What's she doing? I'll keep an eye on her. Wow, you look amazing. Thank you. Good evening. Evening. Bon appetite. Wow. What is this? Charlotte! I know. Can you believe it? This is incredible. Are you sure? It's my 10th test. Is it mine? Yes, of course. I'll get a test to prove it, if you want. We're doing good, aren't we? I can't believe I almost screwed everything up. So did I. I'll do better. Please tell me. Say you're mine. What are you doing? No, she's going to be back in a minute. Are you okay? I feel faint. Char? Ewan. Where have you been? Charlotte, are you all right? Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. I'll be back soon. What are you doing? Just looking up fainting and pregnancy. It's a thing apparently. Low blood sugar? Yeah, exactly. Oh, no, thank you. You should eat. Morning sickness? Yeah, I'll be fine in a bit. You should try crackers. Sorry? My sister craved them with her first. It makes all the difference in the morning as well. I've just got to develop some pictures from yesterday, so bear with me a little bit. Thank you. I hope you brought the key. We don't have any spare around here. Yeah, I've got both. Don't want anyone going in and ruining my photos. It's called a dark room for a reason, isn't it? Yes, but with all the recent break-ins, I thought I need to be a bit more careful. Exactly. There was a break-in? You didn't tell me. Oh, nothing to worry about. You know, I might just go and get some air, if you don't mind. Yeah, sure. Wait, can you ask Stefan to walk with her, please? Oh, no, Tom, it's fine, I don't need- Don't be silly. I can't have my beautiful wife falling into the pond. Honestly. No, seriously, though. It was Tom's father that planted the apple tree against his father's wishes. It was he that bought the manor in the first place, but it was Isadora that really made this place shine. Mrs. Carlisle, are you okay? Yes, sorry, Stefan. Would you mind getting me something to drink? Be right back. Hello? Hi, is this Rebecka? I'm calling about your brother. Listen, if this is another prank call- No, we were in a relationship. Go on. My name's Charlotte. Listen, could we meet? Something's happened to him, hasn't it? I think it might be my fault. Someone's been following me. Tomorrow at Richmond Park, 5 o'clock, near the coffee cart. Thank you. Hi, how long have you been waiting for? Charlotte? Hi, Rebecka? Becky. You're exactly how I imagined. He talked about me? When was the last time you saw him? A few weeks ago. We were supposed to meet the next morning, but he never showed up. We were going to run away. From the people he owes money to? What people? Oh, I dunno. It's just, well, he was in trouble. It stands to reason it was about money. You said someone was following you. Do you think it could be them? You're rich, aren't you? No, my husband is. Which means you are, which is probably why they're following you to get to him. So, if we find out who they are, then I suppose they could take us to Ewan. You know Ewan's not his proper name? Oh, yeah, I do. Oh. You can get it. No, it's fine. Well, I've exhausted the police, the hospitals. He's not touched his bank account. The police are aware, but they just don't consider him a priority. I take it you haven't got a clue where he is or who was after him? No. There is the girl at his apartment. What girl? At his place in Hackney. He doesn't live in Hackney. We met there all the time. Well, let's go. I can't, not now. That was your husband calling, wasn't it? I'm sorry. I'm not here to judge you. I just want to find my little brother. You have to answer my calls. I was in a shop. I didn't hear it. Don't fucking lie to me! You were in the park. I'm trying, Charlotte. I'm trying really hard here, but you have to meet me halfway. Did you track my phone again? Do you have any idea what a cheating wife does to a man? You tell me that you're being followed, therefore I have to know that you're safe. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. You want me to protect you, Charlotte? You have to help me do that, okay? Say you're mine. I'm yours. Hey, didn't you get enough exercise last night? Aren't you supposed to be working? Don't tell me you've forgotten. It's our work dinner tonight, to celebrate. Got you some bagels. And I got you this. I've got the same one at work on my desk. It's lovely. Isn't it? If you don't mind, I might have breakfast when I get back. There's a class starting in a minute. Mother is parking the car. She'll be here in a minute. Speak of the devil. Sorry, I should've warned you before. She just said she wanted to speak about pregnancy and stuff. Morning. Hi, Isadora. I was just heading out. You're not going out dressed like that, are you? Thank you! This is just my gym gear. And why is no one handing me a drink? Do you mind? Thanks. Coffee? Thank you. Actually, Char, could you make her bagel as well please? Oh, don't put too much humus on it. Load the cucumber. No salt, lots of pepper. Sounds good, actually. Same for me, please. Haven't you just had breakfast? Yeah, so what? You've always been like that, a greedy pig. When I was pregnant with him, he nearly killed me, took all the nutrients from my body. You told me that I almost died. Well, you did. You strangled yourself on me umbilical cord. They had to cut you out. Touch and go, they said. I didn't see you for hours. Yeah, and now I can't get rid of you. Oh, thanks. And you're still taking my nutrients. There's another one on the way. Oh, God, I'm sorry! Are you okay? Have you burned yourself? No, your rug, I've ruined it. I need some carpet cleaner and a tea towel. It's fine. I'll do it. No, no, no. Oh, it won't come out. Don't worry. We'll just get someone in to clean it. Mother, it's fine. Leave it. It's done now. Are you okay? Yeah, just pins and needles. I'll be fine. Can I get you some water? Something stronger, dear. Tom, I'll have to go and get a new dress for tonight. Yeah, fine. Just meet us there, I guess. Are you sure about this? You've got my size, right? Remember, you have to be there by seven, no later. I'll contact you if I need you. Yes? What do you want? We're looking for my brother. We know he stayed here. And I told her, he didn't. Oh, wait, please! We just want to know what happened. He's missing. What's that got to do with me? Here, this is him. Sorry, I've never seen him before. Move your hand. Great. Shit, I think that's the guy that's been following me. What the fuck, Troy? Jesus, when did you get back? I thought you'd moved out. Well, you could have called, couldn't ya? At least told me you're coming back. Come on. You're crazy. Let's go. So, come on, then. What shit have you got yourself involved in now? What are you talking about? Two women just turned up, looking for some missing bloke. What? Fuck! Fuck. You lying little shit, you did something at my place. You've been away for God knows how long, okay? I needed to pay rent. Is that what you've been doing? Watching people again. It was just some guy I know. He was fucking a married woman for money. If you've bought me any grief, in fact, do you know what? Get the fuck out of my house. - Paula, Paula! - I mean it. Look, I'm paid to take photos, that's it. Well, then where's the money? 'Cause it's not like you paid me any rent. They were supposed to pay and then they fired me. Oh my God. So I took something of theirs. You're going to love this, come on. Shit. You are pathetic. All right, just give me five minutes. I'll grab the key and then I'll explain it all. Look, we need help. Just here us out, please. And what if I don't? Please. For fuck's sake. He's involved in something. I need a hammer. Who does this belong to? That's Isadora's. Fucking idiot's forgotten his key. You two should probably hide. I told you. Sh, sh, sh, sh! What the fuck are you doing? Come on! I feel sick. That necklace belonged to my mother-in-law. What? She set me up! What the fuck just happened? Your brother was paid to sleep with me. Maybe Isadora's covering her tracks. Fuck, fuck, fuck. But she can't be responsible for murder. Was my brother killed, protecting you? Give me your phone. Please be nearby, Stefan. The police? No, take this. It's evidence. Are you okay? You should go. Are you okay, Mrs. Carlisle? Yes, I just don't want to be late. It's all there, like you asked. Thank you, Stefan. Seriously, though. Thank you so much, guys and gals, for everything you've done. I couldn't have done it without you. Congratulations. Cheers! Great dress. I need to talk to you. Now? You look stunning. Mrs. Carlisle. Have this. Thank you. Steady, steady, steady. Who's this for? It's for me. Mother, I'm so glad you could make it. Well, my money started this whole venture, so I should reap some benefits. Would you, dear? Thank you. Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Oh, Francis. Good evening, Isadora. How are you? I'm short of a double G and T. For you, madam? Uh, just tap water. She's got a baby on the way. Drinks coming right up. You okay? Just need the bathroom. Are you all right? Stressful day. It's not easy, thinking for two. You've got some red on you. Have you hurt yourself? No, it must be a bite or something. Someone's been following me. What are you talking about? When I was meeting you, and I'm still being followed. You always did have a vivid imagination, Charlotte. This has gone far enough. Tom needs to know, and you need to stay the fuck away from me. Charlotte, I have never had you followed. My friend happened to see you outside Harrods. That's all. You paid Ewan to seduce me, and now someone's dead. I... - Charlotte? I, I... Help me. What? I love you. You've reached Tom's voice mail. Please leave a message. Tom, You have to call me back. I need to talk to you. Hey, are you okay? Can you meet? Do you think that's wise? You really need to see this. I'll send you the address. Hi, Mrs. C. Are you feeling better? I don't know what happened last night. Did you bring me home? Yes, with Mr. C. Can you come and get me now? Sorry, no, I'm driving to the manor. Who's with you? Isadora. I shan't be long. Isadora, I wasn't expecting you. I'm not staying, Tanner. Just forget I'm here. Hi. You've been busy. I couldn't sleep. There's quite a lot of them. It looks like your mother-in law had you both followed for months. Why pay Ewan to sleep with you? Did you find any more of these? Um, that pile there. Fuck. They must have been inside the flat. The same person that killed that poor girl was in there, watching you. This is freaking me out. What are you doing? I used to hide in there. What, you thought I didn't know you were in there? Is everything all right? We don't need to air our dirty laundry in public, do we? Public? Think of the staff. Isadora, are you okay? Yeah, all hunky dory in here. Thanks, Mrs. T. Ah, yeah, precious Peter. Run away with me, Issy. What about Tom? He's not a kid anymore. I covered for you. You have no idea what that cost me. Who cares what it costs? Peter didn't deserve what happened to him! So you know? Know what? It was an accident, right? Deep down inside, you always knew. Is that what you liked with Peter, huh, huh? Please, Tom, stop it! So you did know, and you did nothing. You are my son. I am what I am. I am your son. Can you blame me? Well, you don't own me, and I have, ah, made sure, ah! Mother? Tanner! If you're fucking around... I can't feel my... Tanner, Tanner! What's happened? I don't know. She just collapsed. She's having a seizure! Call an ambulance! Isadora? It's okay, Isadora. This is so fucked up. I can't do this anymore. I can't be connected to you, Charlotte. People are dying. Becki. You should go. You have a husband, a driver, a fucking housekeeper. It's just me. Becki. I'm frightened. Please, just leave. Tom? Hey. How's she doing? She's had an aneurism. There's nothing they can do. Can we talk about something else? Sure. You wanted to talk? Hm? You left me a voice message, and then, at the dinner, before you'd had too much Champagne, you said you wanted to tell me something. Yeah, um... It's fine. It doesn't matter now. I'll miss you. Isadora Carlisle's last will and testament. Obviously, the business and the manor already belong to you, Tom, but she was very clear about the rest of the estate. Aside from the specific trust fund she set up for your future children, and the significant gift she leaves to Mrs. Tanner, everything else goes to Charlotte. What? The 10 million remaining has been requested to go to Charlotte. Why? No, that's impossible. What the fuck were you thinking, letting my mother do that? Isadora was a force to be reckoned with. I did warn her this would cause issues. That's impossible! I looked at it the other day. How could this have happened? I'm her son! This is fucking insane! Becki, hi. I told you not to call. I know, I know, but listen, it doesn't add up. What doesn't? Isadora, she passed away. Right. She left all her money to me. I don't want to know, Charlotte. Look, I'm going to have to go. Wait, wait, but it doesn't make sense. Why would Isadora do that? Well, maybe Isadora wasn't behind it. Then who was? I can give you a month, but then I need to go. What a surprise! You finally get money out of us and now you leave! I mean things won't be the same without Isadora. Yeah, well, I'll be sorry to see you go. Tom, I don't know why she did it. Really? Because she told you everything. It was as much a surprise to me. How is your sister? She's getting better. Thanks to Isadora. Stefan. Mr. C. Rabbit stew for supper? Charlotte will love that. Are you okay? He was just being, um... Did you know what she was planning? Were you in on this as well? What? No, of course not. What is it? Burn these sheets. What? Fuck! Fuck! She used to put these on the fucking bed whenever she fucked! I've hurt you. I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry. This isn't good for me or the baby and I won't accept it. I'll leave first thing in the morning. No, please, please, don't. You don't know what I've been through. You don't know what it was like to grow up in this house. No one ever argued with my mother, and now she's delivered a final blow with this will. Don't. Just don't. Ah, you're up! I've given Stefan and Tanner the day off. I thought I'd treat you to a special breakfast. Here, let me help you with that. Your favorite, coffee and crackers. No, Tom, I don't want any of this. Look, I know that I haven't been myself, and I promised that I would change to help this marriage, and I haven't kept that promise yet, but I want to be there for the mother of my son, and I've taken this week off work, so we can spend some quality time together. Please, give me one more chance. Just today if nothing else, and if you're still not happy later, I'll tell Stefan to take you home, okay? You should eat. You're hungry, right? What are you waiting for? So, I'm going to build a play area over there, and on the left, there'll be a slide, and a swing on the right. This is what we can't have in London, all this space. I'll protect you. I just want us to go back to how we were. You're mine, Charlotte. And we will be happy, I promise. Here. To us. I didn't make it. Mrs. Tanner left it for us. Well, I was surprised you managed breakfast. Well, technically... Here, I got you something. It's just a little gift that I think you might enjoy. Stunning, isn't it? You should try it on. Move your hair. It's so stunning, you can't even speak. Wow, it looks gorgeous. Are you okay? Oh, okay. Here, easy, sit. What's wrong? Are you feeling faint again? Could you just get me some tap water? Yeah, sure. Easy, easy. I think I'm going to be sick. Shit, shit, shit, shit. Char, what's going on? I'm fine. Let me in, Char! I'm fine. I'll be out soon. I'm not gonna leave you. I'm okay, I promise. Could you get me some crackers? They help to settle my stomach. Ah, shit, yeah, of course. Where are they? I finished them. What? You serious? Yeah. Okay, I'll be right back. Where are you gonna go? There's a petrol station near town. Great, hurry. Hi, Stefan, it's me. I know it's your day off, but I need your help. I'm at the manor. Pick up, pick up, pick up! Hi, Becki, it's me. It's really urgent. I need you to call me back! It's Tom! What? He gave me the necklace as a gift. He had no idea we were there. What are you talking about, Charlotte? Tom! The hammer, he killed that girl! Holy fuck, is he after you? No, no, I'm at the manor, but I've got maybe 10, 15 minutes, tops. You need to get out of there! No, I need real proof. Can you do that? I have to. If I don't hear from you again soon, then I'm gonna call the police, all right? Let's hope you do then. You shouldn't be in here. Tom, what the fuck? What the fuck? This is sick! They're just photographs, Char. They're not just photographs! You have been lying to me since we met. It's been you all along, following me, watching me. I trusted you, and you've been drugging me. Why? I was afraid of losing you. But you set me up with Ewan? How am I not enough for you? I make you laugh. I give you everything you need, and then as soon as I put a man in front of you, you didn't resist, did you? You fell in love with him, Char. Where is he? He was paid to sleep with you. How desperate can you be? I was there. I saw you kill that woman. Did you kill Ewan? You recognize me? How the fuck did you find me? Did you think Troy wouldn't tell me? What do you want? I love her. I paid you to fuck her, not fall in love with her. Yeah, but that's just it. I'm really sorry, but you just don't deserve a woman like Charlotte, so I'm going to tell her everything. Absolutely everything, and I'm just going to hope that she forgives me. I'm here to settle this honorably. I don't want anything from you. I'm gonna take real good care of her. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing? He had no right to try and take you away. You're mine. Fuck you. Let me go. I can't, Char. No, no, let me go! You just wouldn't behave, Charlotte. It was your choice. I tried, but it didn't matter what I did. He was a good man! I would have been happy living on the street with him, because then at least I'd be free! I hated watching you fuck him, but they were the best pictures I've ever taken. Put the weapon down! He was trying to kill her! Put the weapon down! Are you okay, miss? Miss, you need to come with me. Come on. Becki, hi. Hey, how's the baby? Oh, he's fine. I think he's teething. I just thought you'd like to know the police are closing the investigation. What? But they still haven't found Ewan. I guess I'm just going to have to accept it. Troy is still on the run. Don't give up yet. There's still an avenue I'd like to try. Where is she? I thought you'd look me up eventually. Please. He looks exactly like you. You'll grow strong, like your mother. So, I reckon you've got some questions for me. Shall we start with your sister? My sister got ill. I needed to find the money to pay for her treatment. Isadora was only too helpful. I didn't realize how much that would compromise me. I had to keep their secrets. Tom was afraid that Peter would take Isadora away. One day, I hear a loud crash and I go running, and there was Peter, at the bottom of the stairs, dead. And you think Tom killed him? We buried him under the rose bushes. So, now you know my secrets. I hope you'll keep them. There is something else. He was released from hospital a few days ago. Tom thought he was dead. He wanted me to cover it up. He was a burglar. He attacked me. But I knew he was lying. I kept him alive. I used their money to help him. I'll leave you alone. Charlotte. Darling. Oh, my.
