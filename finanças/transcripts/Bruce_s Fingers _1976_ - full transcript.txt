San Francisco. In this town a boy was born at novembre 27th 1940 in Chinatown who will became world-famous. His name: Bruce Lee. His real name was Lee jun fan, but his parents decided to call him Bruce Lee when he was 13. Mostly for the sake of his career. Because up to the age of 18 Lee jun fan alias Bruce Lee played in 20 movies in Hong Kong. Sometimes even as the leading star. In 1958 - his parents returned to Hong Kong when he was 3 months old - Bruce immigrated to America and lived in Washington. He visited a university and studied philosophy. He lived there in a small flat along with his eurasian girlfriend pai haise. Because of her he got to know his later wife Linda Emery. The first years in America were very hard for Bruce. He hardly got job offers for acting. And so he used his time to intensely study kung fu. He already was an excellent fighter, because his sensei yip man educated him well. But nevertheless he trained very hard and during the years he developed a completly new kung fu style. His unique "jeet kune do" style. I feel that you will make a big career. You will be world-famous. Pai haise was right. He got world-famous. One reason was his unique style to use the nunchakus. He made his first experiences with the kung fu of the Shaolin together with his sister Phoebe when he was 8. Their father introduced them into the basics of kung fu. In America Bruce founded some kung fu schools, but they weren't a financial success. Listen, pai, you can only earn when you invest. From now on I will also teach at night. You are crazy, you won't stand it very long. But pai was wrong. Bruce worked like a maniac. And after some time success knocked at the door. TV and cinema discoverd him and he got first offers. At this time he already was engaged to his later wife Linda. And his former love to pai turned into real friendship. First pai sufferd a lot from this situation but later she realized that Linda was Bruce's big love for life. From this time on pai cared only for his business, did the office work, operated the telephone and did all his contracts. She sent his photos to all TV stations and movie companies and one day he got an offer from a television network. They wanted him for the role "kato" in "the green hornet". Bruce wasn't very happy because he didn't like television. But neighter Bruce nor pai sensed at that time, that he will be famous in whole America through this TV series. No, I don't want to do television stuff. And how far his opinion changed... After broadcasting the first episodes and people on the street identified him and congratulated him to his huge performances, Bruce suddenly loved television. He did 40 episodes and the first time in his life he had no financial problems. He got more offers. For example he played in the series "lronside" a guest part. He met a lot of important people like James coburn, Steve McQueen, Roman polanski, stirling silliphant, a famous script writer with whom the wrote the TV series "longstreet", where he also played the leading part. Bruce worked without a break. He shot movies, gave kung fu lessons and perfected his unique "jeet kune do" style. Movie producer recognized his fighting style and his actor skills. He got a lot of offers. Raimond Shawn, the big movie tycoon got him back to Hong Kong and with him in the leading part he shot the movie "fists of fury" this movie made him world-famous within one night. Bruce Lee had a sensational career and paid a high price for it. At July 20th 1973 he died of a collapse of his blood circulation. Elicited by the overstraining of this body. The film you are about to see was produced in the year 1964 under the working title "Bruce's finger" and they say it is about a true event in his life. I warn you. There's no way at all that you get at me. Unless you can find some proof. - Lee Hung, don't be so stupid. We are looking for our proof. Sooner or later, I'll put you inside. - Lee Hung, so you're back. Tell me, how come you're so happy today? - Rose, I found where the Kung Fu Finger Book is. - All you think of is finger kung fu. You don't care about me. - We're old friends. You should know me well. I wanna master Bruce Lee's finger king fu style. And he was still alive, I would now defeat him. - Bruce Lee's nothing compared to you. Your kung fu's already good. Why bother with finger kung fu? - Because I must. Okay, don't get up. Hey Tong, these men on the photo. Bring them here to me. - These are Bruce Wong's friends. Chong Chi and Allan Fong. - Get him! - You damn idiot! How dare you come back without having found him? If we don't find him, we won't find the Kung Fu Finger Book. - Yes, sir. - Boss, it doesn't matter. There are still the other two guys in the photo. - Tong, you really are quite smart. Bring Bruce Wong's housekeeper here to me. Send somebody to get him while Bruce is still away. Interrogate him and find out where the Kung Fu Finger Book is. - Yes, boss, yes. - We don't want the police to find out. And so don't you make any mistakes. - Yes, boss. - All right, you bastard. Be a good boy and tell us where the Kung Fu Finger Book is. Or else we'll kill. - Oh please, I honestly don't know. - You don't know, eh. I'll make you talk. - Hold on. No need to beat him. Leave him here a few days. When he's hungry, then he'll talk. - Hey, where did that guy go? - How would I know? - Damn! Won Nao, maybe he's got away. - No he's not. Probably hiding in here. Let's go. - Come on, get a move on. - You're looking for me? - Mr. Wong, welcome back. - Thank you. Where's my mother and sister? - Your mother passed away last month. - And my sister? - She's moved away. - Moved away? Hello? Operator, give me Hong Kong 44798. - Hello? What? Bruce Wong? Just got back, eh? - Yeah, Mina. I wanna see you today. We must talk. - Okay. I'll meet you at The Peak at five o'clock. - Mina! - Bruce. When did you get back? - Just yesterday. - Old Kwok wrote me a letter and told me to come back and find the Kung Fu Finger Book. - Kung Fu Finger Book? But old Kwok has disappeared. - He disappeared? - Mm-hm. I don't know where he's gone. And it won't be easy to find him. Oh, Bruce, you're in danger here. You should go back to America. - No way, I must search for Kwok and the Kung Fu Finger Book. - But Bruce, it would be dangerous. - I don't care. Ever since I got back to Hong Kong, things have been going badly. - What happened? - My mother's dead and I don't know where my sister is. I have to find her as well. - Eddie, you said you'd find me a job. How can you ask me to do such a disgusting thing? - Shiu Ju, please understand. I've lost my job and I got no money. Just do it for a month or two. When I pay back the money I owe, then you and I can get married. - No, I can't, Eddie. I can't. Please don't force me into. - Shiu Ju, I beg you. Tell them you'll do it or they'll kill me. Shiu Ju, please do it. Shiu Ju. - Now listen, you should realize by now that you have no choice. And you know Eddie owes us about 10,000 plus some interest. If he doesn't pay me, I'll break his leg. If won't do it, we'll deform your pretty face. - Uncle, let me talk to her. - Right, you convince her quick. - Yes, I'll convince her. - Go! - Eddie, I can't. I can't do it, really, I can't. - Shiu Ju, please say you will. If you don't, I know he'll break both my leg and then he will deform your face as well. - I won't. I cannot do it! - Shiu Ju, tell them you'll do it. Just this once. - No, I won't! - Shiu Ju, I beg to say you'll do it. - You stupid bitch! So you still won't agree, huh. Well I'll make you sorry you disobeyed me. - Uncle! Come on, my friend, don't queue up, I want a draw. Give me it! Hey Ken, bring this cadger some stuff. And who will pay for it? - I will pay. But he won't get heroin. It's excellent stuff, premium quality. Don't talk so much, give him the stuff. Smoke yourself to death. Strange fellows... Give me a light. Guy, you still like to go to the brothel? I suppose you already had every woman. Yes, but I heard Mr. ku got a new girl. Her name is Phoebe. He wants 500 dollar for her. I'am not able to afford her. Phoebe is her name? - Yes, do you know here? No, I don't know her. He)' Qllys, razzia, get away! Get your fingers off! Stop, you vagabond! What do you want from me? Careful, i'am a sick man. Listen, where is Lee Yung? - I don't know, believe me. No clue? - Lei Cheung. - Bruce Wong. Long time no see. - You get around a lot. You should know a bit about what's happening around town. - Of course, I do, yeah. - Well, do know where my sister is? - I hear she's been forced into working as a call girl. - Working as a call girl? In which place? - I think it's Sam Shui Pow, at Mr. Ku's place. - Ku's place? - Yeah. - Leave the clothes on. Sit down. - You don't want me the undress”? We gonna watch TV? - Shut up or I'll stop being polite. Would you like a grape? - No, thanks. I'd like a smoke. - Okay, you smoke. - Mister, I've been here long enough. I got somewhere else to go. - If I tell you, you'll sit. - Damn him, we waited two hours now. How much longer? - Go and hurry him up. - Better than that, charge him for a double. Bastard. Lilly, hurry up. Hasn't he finished? Open up. No, please. Take it easy, friend. - Take me to Ku and quick! - Hello, Mr. Liu. We have a new girl. I know you'll like her. But she's a bit expensive. About 500. Yeah, don't worry. I'll send her round here now. Yeah, it's all arranged. Buh-bye. Eddie! - What? - Come here. - Yes, sir. - Did she agree then? - She still said she won't do it. - Useless. Hey, you girl, if you won't agree, I can see that I'll have to show you that I really mean business. Arthur! - What is it? - Take her inside, teach her a lesson. - Come on. - Eddie, I'm scared. - Scared, huh. Now you be good now and do as I say. If now, I'll let that shake have a bite of you. Arthur, open the door. - Right. - Now you're to treat the customers well. Do you understand me, huh? - Bruce! - Hey! You! - Now, listen to me. - Shut up. I don't like your face. I'm warning you. If you I ever see you again, I might even kill you. - Never guessed that guy Bruce Wong would appear and mean trouble. - Mr. Ku. - Yeah? - You're useless. - Yes, yes. Mr. Lee, it's like this. My boys just can't handle him. This guy's kung fu is good as his teacher's. - And how good was his teacher? I could've beaten him. No trouble at all. - Yes, boss, of course. If you fought Bruce Wong yourself-- - You damn fool! Why should I do it myself? - Yes, boss, you're right, I'm stupid. - Tell all of your boys to find Bruce Wong. Okay, you may go now. - Yeah, yeah, thank you, thank you. - Ali, Tong. - Yes, sir? - Yes, boss? What do you want? - Those men are absolutely useless. I think I'd better send you two out. Find out what this Bruce Wong has got to. - Yes, sir. - And don't kill him. I need him alive. I'll force him to tell me where the Kung Fu Finger Book is hidden. - Hi, Mina. This is my sister, Shiu Ju. Say hello. - Hello. - Please, come in. - Thanks. - Sit down. - Yeah. - Please excuse me. My servant has taken a day off today. What will you drink? - Nothing, thanks. I have to go soon. - How did you find your sister? - Mina, I was brought to a brothel by a boy that I knew. Luckily, my brother got me out. - I suspect those people were involved in Kwok's disappearance. I'm going to investigate while I'm here. - But Bruce, you must be very careful. - I'll be careful. I would like my sister to move in with you for a while. Okay? - Yes, of course. It's a good idea. Should be good company. - Bruce! - Allan! - Long time no see. Where've you been? - I've been in America. - Come on, get in. - Okay. - Bruce, what did you comeback to Hong Kong for? - I've comeback to find the Kung Fu Finger Book. - Ah, you should ask Mr. Chao. He might know where the Kung Fu Finger Book is to be found. - Hello, Bruce. Practice by yourself now, huh. - Okay, yeah, okay. - Master Chao. - When did you get back? - About two days ago. - I'm pleased to see you. - Thank you very much. There's something I want to ask you. - What's that? - Master Chao, have you ever heard of finger kung fu? - Finger kung fu? Is that the kung fu that Bruce Lee perfected? - Yeah, I wonder if you'd help me look for his book. - Okay, I'll see what I can do. - Thanks a lot. Master Chao, I must go now. - Why must you leave so soon? Let me finish the class. Then we'll go and have a drink. - No, thank you. I must go and see my tutor. I'll come back and see you this evening. We'll have a chance to talk again then. - Fine, I'll see you this evening then. Don't you forget now, huh. - Okay. - Try this. - Master! - Bruce! Where have you been? - Yeah. - Come, come this way. - Master, where's the Kung Fu Finger Book? - I don't know. - Master, I'm sure you do know. So why don't you say? - Pick all the pieces of it. Why the hell did you break that cup? What's wrong with you? - Master, I wanna apologize. Here are two cups in return. - Bruce, the cup was not valuable but my teacher used it for many years. - Master, please forgive me. I didn't know it was so important. - Nevermind, you're still young. I don't blame you but the Kung Fu Finger Book, don't ask me anymore. - Master, I beg you to help me. - Now please, don't speak of it again. By the way, Bruce Lee left some practice weapons here. They maybe some of use. Take them away if you want. (brooding ambient music) - Hey. - I'll pay you back for that. - We wanna thank you for saving us. You must be a good friend of our leader. - Oh, and who's your leader? - Our leader is called Lee Hung. - Oh, so Lee Hung is your leader. Where is Lee Hung now? - I don't know. - Where is he? - I don't know. - What do you want? - We want your life! - It is said the hidden weapon is the most dangerous. I'm glad you'd come. I wish to talk. Kung fu is a means of exercise and self-defense. It is not meant just for fighting. - You're right. I know, Master, what you say is true. But if I don't use kung fu, then how can I deal with these criminal? - Now, Bruce, Hong Kong has laws and police. Criminals should be dealt with by them. Also the law will protect those who are really innocent. You shouldn't do it yourself. - Okay, perhaps you're right. Master Chao. - Well, my friend. You have done well. - Yes, boss. I'll beat to death anybody that helps that kid. - Yeah, that is good. - Oh, boss, you do nothing but talk of killing. I'm real scared. - Rose, I may kill others but I won't kill you. Oh yeah, there is one of them. - What's that? - You must be very careful. Try not to offend his master, Wong Shun Leung. - Wong Shun Leung? - Wong Shun Leung is too good. You could never beat him. Also, he's friends with the police. If anything should happen, there's nothing I could do. - I'll watch out. - Now do just I say. Send someone out to get him. When he is caught, bring him and his sister here. - Yes, sir. Oh, I remember. My men tried to trace his sister before. I think she's living with that actress. - Well, why wouldn't your teacher help you? - Well, I don't blame him for it. Everybody's opinion is different. I know he has his reasons. - Bruce. I'm really worried about you. There's so many of them, how can you handle them all? - Don't you worry. I'll help your brother deal with these people. - Just the two of you? How will you manage to beat them? - Mina, my master said, one can't give in to these kind of people no matter what they do. I won't be afraid. - Bruce, I know some police. Perhaps I could ask them to help you. - No need. Alerting the cops would scare these people off. - Ah, by the way, when you came here, was anyone following you? - Nobody followed us. Mina, can I use your telephone, please? - My phone's in there. Help yourself. - Thank you. Damned, the phone! Honey, why can't you never answer one call? Because they are always for you. Hello. Lee Yung, can you find out who killed sensei Chang? That's not easy. Yes, I will. I will ask around in the opium den. Yes, I have a suspicion. You fool, stop talking such nonsense. Hello, Yung, hello! Hello! You damned fool, why do take hand in Bruce Lee's matters? Do you want to get killed? You won't answer the phone anymore. - Who's he telephoning? - I think it's his friend, Lian Chun. - Allan. - Hmm? - 1 was talking to Lian Chun and the line was just cut. - Got to be something wrong. - Allan, come along with me right now. - Okay. - Mina, Shiu Ju, we'll be back in a while. - Please, be careful. - Okay. Let's go. - Mina, will it be dangerous for them? - Not at all, don't worry. Get you fingers off. - You sissy. Honey... Tell me when we had sex the last time. (An you remember? Yes, I know, it's a long time ago. But all will be good. Oh the bell rings. (An i please open the door? Yes, if you need to... - Yes? Thank you. I run. Stupid cow. How she behaves... What do you want? Get your fingers off me! Let's get away get out, rat, I have to talk to you. - No. - How come it's open? - He must've been captured. - Not bad, eh. We'll be back later on to see you, okay? Let's go. - All right, you. We've had enough. Where's Bruce Wong? Speak up! - Why ask me? I don't know. - Hey, Tom. Look at the black one. - No. - Is he dead? - Of course, he is. - Mina, I wonder where Bruce is. He's been away a long time. - Maybe he hasn't finished yet. He's be back a bit later. - Mina, do you think these criminal might come here to get me? - Oh no, don't be silly. They wouldn't dare. These are high-class apartments. Downstairs, there's a watchman. It's very safe. Please, don't worry. - But I'm still a bit scared. Mina, look over there. - Don't move! - Don't move! - How come the front door is open? - Quick, inside. - Shiu Ju! Mina? Dammit, they both disappeared. - Disappeared. Ah, that car we've passed. I'm sure they were inside. - Come on. - Hey, Tong. Couple of girls. One each, okay? - Good idea. Let's toss for them. - Wait, wait. The boss has told you. You can't mess with either of these girls. Bill, take them up. - Let's go. - Come on. - Tie all three of them together. - Hey, be careful with them. I better get hurt. - Hey. - Hey? - We like to have some fun with these girls. - That's what I like to have. - Now, listen to me. This place is miles from anywhere. There's no way you can escape, huh. - Hey, let's go put cards outside. Wait for the boss, huh. - Okay. - This way. - All right, guys. - Come on, huh. Come on. - Today, for cash. - Fine with me. - No credit this time. - Nah. - Now, don't start playing it. The boss said he'd be back soon. I'll go have a look. You all wait here a minute. - Yeah, okay. - Okay, we'll wait. - Yeah. - Hey. - Why? - I'm hoping tonight, we'll play those girls. - Yeah, I hope so too we any luck. - Hi, what are you doing here? I've approached polite. Why did you do that, huh? - Now look, just tell me what this is about. What do you want from me? - Your kung fu is very good. Hey, let's stop this nonsense. Work together. - You're one of Lee Hung's men. I'll never work with you. - You're wrong. I wanna get even with Lee Hung. - Oh, what do you want with Lee Hung? Are you looking for the Kung Fu Finger Book? - Kung Fu Finger Book? - The Kung Fu Finger Book that Bruce Lee wrote. As far as I can understand it, Lee Hung has the book now. - Okay, let's go talk to Lee Hung. If he really has the book, then we'll make him hand over. - Hey, Kwok! - Ah, Bruce. - Kwok, so you've been locked up here. - Oh, Bruce, I'm really glad you'd come. I managed to find your master's Kung Fu Finger Book and I want to give it to you. - Where is it? - I've hidden it in a small hut not far from here under the bed. Let's go and get it now. Bruce, don't worry about me. Go get the Kung Fu Finger Book. Don't wait for me. - No way, I better get you out of here. Hey, Kwok. - Bruce. - Go. - Out of the way. I'll do it. Right! - How come they haven't been killed? - Ah, the boss has orders. He wants them to suffer first. Come on. Let go. Come on! - All right! - Hey, Ali. - Yes, boss, what do you want? - Take some men with you. You will get the Kung Fu Finger Book for me. It's under mattress in stone hut, quickly. - Yes, sir. - Okay, okay. 200. - It's now your turn to call, huh. Come on now, let's have some order here. - Okay, okay. - You're in? - I'm in. - Play. - Come on, play me this time! - Sir Billy. - What? - They escaped. - Come on! Quick, over here! - Come on! - Get her! - Okay, what do you have? - Yeah. - I'm in. - Allan, let's go to that stone hut fast. - Hey, I got it. - Got it? - I got it. - Perfect. - Here it is. - Look at that. - Don't move! The Kung Fu Finger Book, give it here. Kung fu finger. You all right? - I'm okay. From what I can see, Mina and your sister as well are locked up in the old house. - What's that? Go ring the police. - We meet again, huh. Let's go have a talk. Hey, your kung fu is pretty good. Have you thought about becoming a police man? - What? You suggest that I join the police? - Yeah. - Well, just what exactly are you? - Me? - So you work for Interpol, right? - Right. Now you should understand why I must get at Lee Hung. - Oh. - Come on, let's go! - Everything okay? Let's go! Get outta there! - Over here. - Let me go! - Over here! - Lets go, let's go! - Hey, wait for me! - Let me go! - Matches! - I won't hurt her. - Let's get it on. - Come in, hurry up there, hurry up. What are you waiting for? - Come on. - It's the police, let's go. - Help me! - There's no use shouting. - Save me! - Stop shouting. We're miles from anywhere. No one could hear you. Hey, look. - Huh? Hello. - Inspector! - You're not hurt, are you? Quickly, untie them both! - Inspector, I just found some drugs. - Huh. So Lee Hung is a drug pusher too. Go ring the headquarters and tell them. - Right. - This time, I've lost almost everything. I never thought that a guy could do me so much harm. - It's over, boss. We'll have to leave here soon. The police are already watching you. I think we oughta go into hiding for a while. - I swear that I will find a way to kill that bastard. Otherwise, I'll not be satisfied. - Hey, boss. - What is it? - I employed group of kung fu experts and stationed them around the house. If Bruce Wong dare show his face around here, I guarantee he won't leave alive. - Tong, well done. - Allan! - Hi - It's been a long time. He's Mr. Chan, Mr. Fong. - Mr. Chan. - Fong. - Where's Bruce Wong now? - Bruce Wong has already found the Kung Fu Finger Book. Right now, he's in a hiding place practicing it. - Ms. Lo, if you really need it, you can ask for police protection. Our as policemen is to protect citizen's lives and property. - Inspector, thanks for the thought. I think those men don't know I moved here. Now, I don't think there's any danger. - Based on what we know, I'd say these men are very powerful. In the new territories, we seize the few of them, however, they escaped and we still haven't found them. - And who is their leader, do you know? - The leader is called Lee Hung. He has a black belt in karate. He is masquerading as a rich merchant. But in fact, we know he has this criminal gang. - Inspector, has that man, Ku, been caught? - I'm afraid not, miss. Ms. Lo, my men are out searching. We're following a number of leads. And with a bit of luck, we'll catch them real soon. - Good, inspector. Oh, someone at the door. Bruce! - Hi, Mina. - Please, come in. Over there. - Hi. - There is he. Inspector Chan, Mr. Wong. - Mr. Wong. - Inspector. This is my very good friend, Allan Fong. - Sit down. - Mr. Wong, I wanna thank you for helping us to break this case. - Mr. Wong, I respected your master too but what uses kung fu in the world of today? - Hey, be careful what you say. My master glorified Chinese kung fu and the world will not forget him. - I only mentioned it. Don't lose your temper. Hong Kong is a law-abiding place. You can't simply take the law in your own hand. Ms. Lo, excuse me, I must go. - Yes, inspector. - Thank you. - Bruce, why were you so unpolite towards him? - I don't like his attitude. - But Bruce, you're far too hot-tempered. - Bruce, Inspector Chan was giving you advice. Why were you so rude? - My brother has a very bad temper. - Same as his tutor. - And what's wrong with that? Don't be angry. - Who's angry? - I have some good news to tell you. I've mastered my tutor's finger kung fu. - Master Wong, our boss has a great deal of respect for you. He asked me to come and see you and to give you this present as a sign of friendship. Mr. Wong. - Thank your boss for me. But I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't accept it. - No? - As your boss already knows, I've pledge not to fight anymore and I won't break that pledge. Please tell him he need not worry. - Oh, well it's fine then. Thank you. Also, your nephew is getting us some trouble. Would you like to help control him? - This is none of my business. Sorry, you must deal with him yourselves. But as I've said, I won't interfere. - Thank you, Master Wong. I will tell my boss everything what you've said. Thank you, I must be off now. - Goodbye, goodbye. Goodbye. - Thank you. - Master? Master. Master, you should congratulate me. - Why, are you getting married? - Oh no. I've mastered finger kung fu. - If it's true, I should congratulate you. - I'll prove it to you. - Okay. - After you. Master. - Well, go ahead then. - Master, what do you think of that? - It's not too bad. - What you mean not too bad? Master, watch this. What do you think? - You definitely show some promise. - Well, how can I master it, huh? - 1 will show you how. Would you like to have a try? Now, watch this. This is called the eighth-finger style. - Eighth-finger style? Well, thank you, master. - Shiu Ju, you're tired. Go to bed. - I'm not tired. I want to wait for my brother. How come he hasn't returned yet? - He's with Master Wong discussing finger kung fu. - Finger kung fu? When's my brother going to comeback and see me? - He will be back today but you'll see him tomorrow. Now then, let's go to bed. - Mina, I don't feel like sleeping. Let me go and watch some TV. - Okay, if you like. - But you're late telling Mrs. Hartman as we're combing the entire area, the tri-county area. Now if the young man. - Who is it? - Help! Help! - Allan, let's go see my sister. - Fine. - Mina, what's going on here? - Three men broke in just now and kidnapped your sister. They left that letter. - Did they look like Ku's men? - No. He says he'll exchange Shiu Ju with the Kung Fu Finger Book. I think it must be Lee Hung. - And what can we do? - I've now mastered finger kung fu.

Is it worth it? - Yeah, this book is worth more than all the diamonds in the world. - Is it really? - Hey, boss, should we do as we said in the letter and let her go? - Lock her up for a while. - Yes. - Let me go! Let me go! - She's so pitiful, Why don't you let her go? - That's enough. None of your business. - I can see that you've become very interested in her. - Don't you be silly. She's only a kid. And anyway, from now on, I must only practice finger kung fu. - I know you're one of Lee Hung's followers. Come on, spit it up. Where is Lee Hung. - Okay, okay, okay. - Tell me where he is! - He's living over in the old villa on Five Gopher Road. - Are you lying? - Why would I lie? - Allan, it's okay. Go and fetch Bruce and then we'll all attack Lee Hung together. - Fine. Mr. Chan, shall I go and inform the police? - No need, I'll tell them myself. Okay, let's split up and go and do what we have to do. - Get him! - Right! - Hey that was great. You got very loud bounce. - Kill! Kill! - Right! - What's wrong? - Over there. Let's get out! - Go! - Seeing you're a woman, I won't kill you. - Mr. Yang. - What is it? - Some man, coming this way. - All right, men. Let's get ready for them. - Hold it! - Right! - You all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. Allan, where's Bruce Wong disappeared to? - He's got to deal with Lee Hung. - Listen, I heard Lee Hung's kung fu is unbeatable. Bruce isn't good enough. - Lee Hung, you're an evil man. You stole my master's Kung Fu Finger Book. And today, you'll gonna pay. - I'm not afraid of you at all. So you've learned finger style. I can still beat you. - I've just had enough of you. Now, you're gonna die! - The first finger style is nothing. Number six, no trouble at all. It's easy. Nothing special about it. That's number two. Kung fu finger's no good. What else can you do? Do you know any other kung fu style? I've defeated the seventh style. Have you ever studied the eighth finger style? - Number eight.
