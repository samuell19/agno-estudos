We just have things available and you are so lucky. That sounds great, thanks. LEE Hanna? LEE Hanna, right? Yeah, but who are you? What a whore! How come you flirt with my husband, you bitch! What? ?l don't like the hotel near the airport?? You screwed every professor, to get a full time job, right? It's your major? You dirty hooker, you don't work for the college any more. How funny your dad is such a celebrity! I'll kick his ass and your whole family is fucked up! What a trash! Hey, she smells so drunk! Hey, miss, it's the last station, wake up and go home. No more trains to Seoul? Sure, long ago. You should've gotten off at Moonsan. This station is only for the tourists, to see the tunnel from North Korea. What's worse, no bus runs any more. Sorry, but could you wake her up? Then this train stays here overnight? Sure, you sound like you know trains. It must've been a tough day. Take care. You better stay out of the snow here in the station. Honey, it's me. Sorry but I don't know where I am. I fell asleep on the train through the last stop. Sorry, I had dinner out and drank too much with friends. You know Mira, she's been heart-broken lately. I had to be with her, so... Don't worry, I'll take a cab home. No way for you to drive here! I'll take care of myself, just stay home. Don't worry. I love you, too. Hello, honey, are you still up? I had some drinks and fell asleep on the train so.. It's too far, Limjin River Staion. You mean you will drive here? No! Don't worry I will take a cab. Sure, good night. She's my fianc?e. We'll get married next spring. By the way, where are we? Limjin River Station. He civilian passage restriction area is just there. It's so odd to have a station here. Maybe it's very new. Have you heard of Dorasan station? Sure, President Bush was there. Oh, was he? It is in the civilian restriction area. Trains go in there during the day but... they should go through a kind of immigration; Screening your ID and stuff. And next is DMZ and then Gae-sung, North Korea. Well, I?ve never been this far. I live in ll-san and... Between Seoul and ll-san Station is all I cover every day. Between Seoul and Shinchon station, and that's what I cover. How far are we from Seoul then? It took 1 hour 23 minutes by train. How about calling a cab? Okay, let me call them. How about sharing a cab? I don't think we can call two, in this snow. Okay, I see. You pay the fare up to ll-san. What? No problem. Give me a number for a cab company in Moon-san. 031-925-0925, thanks. Hello, I am in Limjin River station, send a cab right away. What? Oh, don't say that, please help. What? No taxi is available, considering the snow. He said it's not worth it. No kidding! 031-925-0925 Hello, I'm at Limjin River station. I'll pay you double to Seoul. It's snowing, that's why I need a cab, you idiot! What? Hello! Let's walk. Hey, let me carry your bag. You could've told me that earlier. You just keep walking? You got a better idea? When we get to Moon-san there must be something. Yeah, it's the best thing. How about calling your husband and driving this way? If he drives this way and we walk this way, you can meet him on the way. How about your fianc?e? She doesn't have a car. My husband gets to work very early. If he doesn't have a sound sleep, it may endanger his important work. Hearing you talking to her, I felt like she has a car. How did you meet her for the first time? What? It may take hours in this damn snow. Talking would help, don't you think? You know ''Pond Monthly''? I do. Every month, when it came out... She came to my train and gave it to me. You're a train driver? Yes. What a cool job! Are you serious? Sure, it's a very rare and awesome job. Thanks. It's your turn, how did you meet your husband? When I was a freshman, he was a graduate. He was intelligent and handsome, so we girls just admired him. He went to Berlin, to continue to study and... Years later, I did too, so we could see each other again. When I got there, It was awful and... He was almost finishing his dissertation and a great help to me. So we just clicked like that. - Then you got married in Berlin? - No. He came back to Korea and I had to be in Germany for my diploma. Not long after, he got a full-time professor job. He was lucky as well as competent. It's not long ago I came back to Korea. We got married just recently. It's so cool. But maybe without such loneliness back then... we'd never feel for each other. I lived at the far North-west end of West Berlin. I couldn't find a room in the school dormitory and... I barely managed to find a room at the hospital dormitory. And just behind the dorm was found a part of the Berlin Wall, which was eerie and creepy. I was afraid. Long winter nights felt like no-end. I had seen some going insane while studying in Germany. And talking to themselves is the first sign of that. Then the moment finally came to me when I was in the tub... I found myself talking to myself on and on... Don't tell me you're insane. You just made me insane again! Sorry. Then you got the doctoral degree? It's awesome, how honored I am to walk with a doctor. But I got only a part time job. To me, your job is greater. Then your major is... German literature. I know Hermann Hesse, I read 'Demian'. The bird fights its way out of the egg. The egg is the world. Who would be born first must destroy a world. The bird flies to God. That God's name is Abraxas. Hermann Hesse was the one who made me major in German. But I came to study on Christa Wolf. What is he? SHE is from Eastern Germany, a writer. She devoured my whole youthful ardor like a wolf. Hey, there's a motel. What a relief! I should be in there, not to be frozen to death. It's me. She read your email, she got the password, God knows how. I got on the plane, and was shocked to see her. She even came to see you, sorry. Where are you now? It's Cheju, Hotel Shilla. I begged an apology for hours. She is now in bed after being drunk. I just cooked up some reasons and said nothing happened. No idea what she told you but... No 'divorce' thing brought up? She did. It's a big mess. But you begged for forgiveness instead of being divorced! What? - I just got divorced. - What? I got divorced! It's 40,000 won. We need two rooms. One is enough. Only a few hours away from daybreak. - You said, 40,000 won? - Yes. It's warm and nice. Look, here is shower gown, too. I need to take a hot bath. As to the recent sagging economy and depression... Other than high cost structure, high wage level is said to be one of the reasons. And the statistics shows it makes to the point. As of 1994, average monthly wage of the factory workers is $1273. This is MBN Headline News, and we'll call for the weather news. The worst snow fall ever is striking a fatal blow on the whole country... Its damage is estimated to be more than 210 billion won. Hey, could you turn on the light? It's off now. Now, it's on? Not yet. Now it's on? Yeah, thanks. Sorry, I pushed the wrong button. You son of a bitch! You didn't know! I miscarried your baby! Just after you were back to Korea... I fell down while smoking in the library... and was carried to ER. How stupid I was not to know I had your baby, you jerk. You are okay with my wearing this? Sure. 16-hour-non-stop snow storm led to a disastrous... Oh I don't need a blanket. Well, I?ll take the bed. You need a blanket. You have a full day ahead of you; you need beauty sleep. I'm on vacation. I got a special leave for 3 days... and I extended it with my annual leave of 7 days... Now I?m almost at the end of the long leave. I lied to you, about the fianc?e. I knew. How? Girls are so quick to smell out a lie. You don't know her name yet, right? You're such a demon. You know why I went to Gae-wha station today? No, why? It's the 15th. She's supposed to give me the magazine. You saw her? No. I waited for her at the platform all day, but she didn't come. What makes me so confused is that... my shifts come and go so irregularly, 05:26, 14:13, 11:11... Even my family doesn't know it and... I got no idea how she got the information. She didn't show up there because she knows I?m off today? Oh, no. You told a lie about divorcing. I did. I was never married. What? To be honest... I'm a whore. Oh, that's enough. Don't play me anymore! What made you become an engine driver? Well, I wanted to be a tram driver. Not the subway train but a tram on the ground. But we don't have one in Korea. When I was young, my mom gave me a storybook as a birthday gift. It was a story about a tram driver... who heals a bird injured by the car and... who brings a runaway kid back home, seeing him on the car all day long. That's the beauty part of the job, and I was fascinated. I saw some on TV maybe in North Korea. When we are united, I can drive one. God knows when. Look at Germany, it just happened as no one expected. To be more honest... My parents were not rich and... I went to railway college, 'cause the school is almost free. You must've done something cool, as you got a special leave. I killed a woman. She just jumped... in front of my train. When a person jumps... We are supposed to stop the train... and to move the dead body. to move this horribly torn body onto the platform... Come on! with my bare hands. Hey, snap out of it! Let me keep the witnesses' numbers, you keep driving! Then we write down telephone numbers of witnesses... and keep driving to the destination... as if nothing happened. Then at the destination, I change shifts, and come back to this station... And write down the statement And go to the police and write it down again. I even went to a shrink. He said I was lucky... 'cause I didn't see her eyes when she was jumping. Last year... Two drivers, being haunted by the eyes of the victims, they killed themselves, After the accident we get 3 days off... And then nothing changes. gotta be back to work as usual. I extended my days off, but just 2 days from now... I gotta be back to work. You think I can do that? You can do it. I know that. tens of thousands of people can't go to work. You can't imagine how many are waiting for you to be back. 1 year later Gyeong-ui-seon by LEE Hanna This book doesn't sell well? Right, the writer is not well known. - Please pack it. - Yes madam. You buy your book? You must've bought more than sold? You have the books? You don't buy your books since you're a full time professor! It's the privilege; I'm flooded with books for free. And your kids already read English books? It's not 'already', moms are crazy when it comes to English. To be frank, it was not until this morning I read your book through. I like your book. I envy you. It only takes time for them to know it. You think so? You presented your books to people? I want to present it to some more people, but... Mom took the remaining books yesterday to give them to her friends. You know my mom, it's so her. I got news from the ground, it just began to snow. And forecast says it'll keep coming. Which means a white Christmas, this year. I wish you all a merry Christmas! Take care going home. I am driver, KIM Man-soo.
