Bulgaria is known as "The Land of Roses". In 1945 the Communist regime seized political power in the country and nationalized every private property and enterprise. Rose oil distilling was monopolized by the totalitarian state. The rose became one of the symbols of the Communist party. Based on a true story. DAMASCENA: THE TRANSITION July, 1969 Stop gazing at that water, Techo! You'll go crazy! Let's go to the deep! Techo, come back! Get out, Techo! I'm coming down to rip your ears off! All six of them! Does it itch? Did you enjoy the nettle? Never jump off the cliffs! Never ever again! Run or I'll catch you again! Feel the fragrance? - Do you like it? - Yes! Don't rush! We will gather for dinner later. What do you think you're doing, son? You're going to break it! These things cost lots of money! Why don't you play it properly so that we can enjoy the music. Come here, Techo. Want to learn how to dance? Now. One - two. Grandma, have you been the Queen of Roses when you were young? Every woman is a queen when she's young. Later she turns into a regular grandma. Grandma, do ghosts talk to people? What ghosts? Who tells you these fantasies? No one needs to tell him! His head is full of fantasies anyway! More than he will ever need! You're so heavy! X Y Z... Bravo, well done! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. A really nice drawing, Techo. Is that you? Yeah. And who's the woman in the pretty dress? The Queen of Roses. When I grow up I'll build her a temple and I'll marry her. The river of my childhood left me two friends and one secret. This secret became my dream. I could not fulfill my dream. I ran out of time. May, 1978 What is the name of the rose richest in oil? Rose Damascena. Do you know why? It was brought from Damascus in ancient times. Hence the name. Is there something you don't know, Techo? It takes a million roses to make one kilogram of rose oil. One million picks, one million seconds are needed to pick all those roses. Human hands are needed here! The Thracians were a wise people. They started growing roses here. Herodotus himself mentions it! And why exactly here? Look at the valley! The Valley of Thracian Kings. Guarded by mountains on both sides, rivers flow into it and irrigate it. As if the Gods themselves protect it! The most aromatic roses... How many trucks left? You are wasting my time all day! This is the last truck for today. Yeah, really! Give a hand to the girls! These are picked by the students! No need to check them! No need? Yeah, right! As if I don't know! Look at this! Too young to cheat, right? I have found stones, bags of water and all kinds of stuff inside. O tempora, o mores. I won't waste your time, comrade director. I just need permission to show the refinery to the students. I'm waiting for a delegation from Sofia. The biggest rose oil buyer. So I'm a little busy. Here they come. Come on, ladies. Welcome! I hope you had a pleasant trip. Good to be here. Such a winding road! And we got really hungry... A welcome fit for a tzar, comrade Kolev! Oh, I forgot. We have a student brigade. The teacher asks whether they can see the refinery. Excuse me? Do you think I need some little moles here? Why? What's going on here? It does not matter whether they are students or not ... From now on, no outsiders! Is that clear? Yes! Move it, move it! Mr. Leibnitz... Please, do come in! Bulgarian Rose - the scent of communism. Here's the new generation. I'll be back. I'll throw you out of here! I'll kick out the likes of you too! Go on. Rose oil is "Liquid Gold", they say. It brought millions and millions to the state. For me the rose oil distillery was a temple, not a cash machine. May, 1986 I'm sick and tired of small time crooks. Everyone cheats in this country. Everyone tries to profit at the expense of the state. But I won't allow it! I won't! Hey, give me that skewer! How are you, guys? Fine, thank you. - Do you want to see the refinery? - Yes! Follow me. And you, go to the scales! You are born in this valley. Our "Liquid Gold" is world famous. You must know how it's made. Kemal! Kemal... I want you to buy them some waffles and sweets. They have been picking roses since five in the morning and they deserve a treat. Come on. This is our new expert, Stefan Stefanov. To us he's Techo. Please, sit down. Do you feel the difference between '83 and '84? Yes. Something's missing here. That's because 1984 was rainy. This has the necessary intensity. It's 1983. Can you compensate technologically for the missing intensity? ?here are some new tanks in the back... Anyone can do it with new tanks. Give me a new solution. Are you Stefan Stefanov? I am. - Hello. - Hello. Let's get straight to the point. Here's the list of all people working at the rose oil distillery. Lots of fezzes you've got here! You know the new directive about the names, right? A week from now there should be no Turkish names. I grew up together with these people. We are friends. Hasan and Yusuf yesterday - Ivan and Kiril tomorrow? How? You just gave them names - and very good ones at that. You are their friend and will easily convince them. We've investigated you - that's why we turn to you, not to the director. Techo, who's gonna get this job done? Who? How do I turn Hassan into Dragan? You know how it works. Calmly, gently... Some beating, if needed. Are you Bulgarians? Are YOU Bulgarian? Who can we trust? Don't you see what's going on? They breed like rabbits. And now what? Kill them like rabbits? They will kick us out! They will establish a state of their own in our land. They will demand autonomy? They'll take everything. They'll change your name to Hasan. They will kick you out but before that they might even intimately ? You will sit and watch? Behave like a Bulgarian. And act like a Bulgarian. Well but? Above all I'm a human. Right, now we will see how humane you are. Keep your temper and it will be ok. Come on! Comrades, colleagues! The Party council wants to help you accomplish the Party's decree for changing the names of our Bulgarian Turks. What's up, buddy? They made you come here as well? Get inside, it will be fine. Comrades... Let's live and work in harmony. There should be no differences between us. We do live and work together! What's wrong all of a sudden? Listen, listen... I know it's hard. But it's hard for all of us. The Party council made this decision to unite the people. Let's look forward. Our children will live together without the embarrassment of their names. We will all be one big Bulgarian family. Comrade ... Pretty, enough bullshit! Get lost, you sleazy bitch, get lost! Wait, wait! Why change names? Ah? Why? We don't want to! I'm sorry, cousin! Does it hurt? - Techo? - I'm fine. You're not welcome in my home anymore. And what about Kemal? They released him earlier. Kemal! What have they done to you? I'm no longer Kemal. My name is Kalin. The voluntary departure must be done in a calm and orderly manner. What are you doing? You will be escorted to the border. What are you doing? Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop, stop! What are you doing, are you mad? These people live here, these are their homes. How many times do I need to tell you? How many times? Do not show off these trousers! How many times do I need to tell you not to show off these trousers! What are you doing? Hey! Pack your things tonight! Are you mad? Wait, buddy! ?must be done in a calm and orderly manner. Easy, Techo. Easy! Go home before we lock you up. - Are you mad? - Don't get involved! Don't touch him! Techo! Easy, buddy! Just go home so we don't have to lock you up again. Don't get involved! You can't do anything! You can't do anything! Pack your things! ... must be done in a calm and orderly manner. You will be escorted to the border. The deadline is 4 pm tomorrow. Take the scarf off. Here are the papers for the car. Hundreds of thousands of Bulgarian Turks were banished from their homes, from their native lands. The Rose Valley became deserted. I hate you all! How will I live without you? Don't build houses on high hills. Don't give away brides in far away lands. Let the birds know I miss my mother. Dear motherland, you are heaven on earth, your vigor, your beauty... Yeah... This year we will buy no roses and produce no oil at all. Things are different now. After the changes... the Western buyers are cautious. So ... we're closing. Temporarily. Not just this distillery. All distilleries. And we'll see who will survive. So why did you call for me? To find out what you gonna do next. You haven't changed much since high school. You thought I didn't recognize you? Well done, you kept your promise. You're back. Only you haven't kicked us out yet. Will you sell me the tanks rusting in the back yard? - What? They're brand new! - They used to be brand new! Even if you get the tanks, you have no roses. I hold all the contracts with the buyers ... The lab is mine ... I thought it was owned by the state... But you still need me to sell even a drop of rose oil. Sell him the tanks. What about me? Boss, we are off. Wait a sec! Treat yourself to a drink for the good work. Thanks, see you tomorrow. I thought you'd never come. You can use an extra hand. - How are things at home? - Well... Your brother's drinking will get him fired. I don't know what to do with him. Do you think I should hire him? DAMASCENA First Private Rose Oil Distillery Your brother won't say no but... I will give it a try. Tell Kiril he's welcome. I will. Come here! No way you'll be hiding the money from me! Where's the money? Hey... Hey, come here! I'll kick your asses! - Who are you? - Gyula. (Rose) Now my name is Detelina. - And who are these two? - My brothers. If they try to beat you again, call me. You call this a beating? And learn how to read. First Private Rose Oil Distillery Damascena. What's damascena? A rose, like you. Did you name it after me? A Bulgarian rose from me, to remind you... Was about time! - Am I that late? - More than I expected. Sit down! Put it down! To Mr. Leibnitz, CEO for Eastern Europe etc. Dear and so on? within 3 months we will present a detailed business plan for the capacity of the first private rose oil distillery in Bulgaria, which is my property and will be run by me. The investigations by Bulgarian authorities have proven that the documents and pictures you have received from Stefan Stefanov regarding an existing private rose oil distillery are fraudulent. Fraudulent! - Got it? - Yes. All necessary measures will be taken in order to cut out any speculations whatsoever. In expectation of our future work together, in your capacity of our biggest client, we, as the first private oil distillers in Bulgaria, truly yours, bla bla bla... Send it to the translator and make sure he does it quickly. 10,000 dollars. Now, how can I help you? Techo? I came to ask you to be my kid's godfather. Techo! There's a famous German philosopher... You don't know him, his name is Friedrich Nietzsche. He says... It means: "What is will never be, what will be has never been." Are you done? I accept! This is for you, then. Godfather. It's not 10,000 dollars, but... I'll call you with the details. We made it. Prepare the purchase contract for the rose oil distillery. Let us pray to God! Do you renounce Satan? I do. Do you renounce Satan? I do. Do you renounce Satan? I do. Hey boss, when did you become a Christian? Faith is the only savior of the soul. Sinful are the children of God. But God is merciful and patient. I don't understand God's way. -Call me to bless the rose oil distillery! - No need for that! You shouldn't bypass me by writing to the Germans. You can't skip me in the rose oil business. I had to try. You're crazy! I know that. Do I tell you you're crazy? Yesterday you were a zealous communist. Today you're an avid democrat and pious Christian. My ex boss has become a priest. Don't tell me miracles don't exist! What are you building by the river? A Temple of the Rose - a part of the complex I'm planning. Little by little it will be ready. There's no end to your wacky ideas! It's not a wacky idea, it's a dream. Alright. I'll leave you the temple. You are convinced that I'm crazy, so I really need tell you. I'll burn down the distillery rather than give it to you. Are you nuts? Crazy, naive? I don't get you at all! If it wasn't for me, no one would've given you a penny. No one! The distillery is mine! Is that clear? Who do you think you are? Oh, Lord, hear my prayer. Amen. This rose oil distillery, Farmarose is blessed in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Mr. Kolev, just a moment! How long did it take you to build the first private distillery in Bulgaria? Long enough so I can now turn back and proudly say that it was worth it. - Mr. Kolev? - Later. Is everything OK with the money? I haven't count it. Techo, there is place for everyone under the sun. Please tell me how I can help you. I need twice as much as you paid me. As a loan. When do you need it? Yesterday. You'll have it tonight. We, the first private rose oil producers, did it. We did it. Congratulations. What's up, bro? I'm going back to the city, there's nothing for me here. Brother! I know you've got 7 kilos of my rose oil in the trunk. You have a choice. You can either give me back my oil and we go on together. Or you can go to the city and we forget we're brothers. You know what... Is she worth it? She will bring you money. What's going on? We fixed Gyula. We'll get some cash. Is this the life you want? You call this a life? Cousin ... This girl is coming with me. Get up! Don't worry, the baby's asleep in the back. The baby peed on the dollars. I hope it's a lucky charm. Where are we going? I don't know. Today the national currency continued its severe devaluation. One US dollar traded for 2100 levs on the interbank market. The cash markets followed a different logic. The USD interbank trade started at BGL 1500 -1650, but by noon the exchange rate was up by BGL 500, and the ask spread hit BGL 2150 at noon. Then the rate decreased and a balance was reached at a bid spread of BGL 1800 and an ask spread of BGL 2100. It is paradox that an ask spread is significantly below the bit spread. Trading was strained. USD 6.6 million were bought and almost USD 5 million were sold. The volumes are below the ones common for the past days. I do not expect that from you. The national currency again lost more than 20% of its value in just a day. Since the start of the year, the dollar has tripled its value against Bulgarian lev. The USD appreciated with nearly 200 BGL today. Are you ok? The posters read: "Pensions - 5 dollars, sausage - 2 dollars" The protesters shouted against a new socialist government and in favor of early elections. Elections! Elections! Take some money from the sack and go buy something for yourself. What something? Clothes, shoes, whatever you need. And get disposable diapers for the baby. Tell them the baby's age. Seven months. Do you want anything? No. You're staying here. First Private Bank Give our money back Hey, where are you going? The line's back there! Hey, wise ass, take you place at the back! Where you going with the sacks, get back! Go inside and tell your boss that Techo is waiting for him outside. Can you please go to the end of the line? I've been freezing here all day for 20 dollars and now that guy ... Easy, there are dollars for everyone. What are you doing here, Techo? The privileged ones will never end... Keep calm. It's a madhouse, the dollar has gone through the roof! Yes, indeed. This isn't inflation, it's an outright catastrophe. The dollar reached BGL 3000 in a day. And what? Everybody's gone nuts, trading their last penny. I know it. I can see it from the hotel over there. But I tell you, the dollar will fall in 3 days. It can't happen. It'll take at least a month. I bet my beard on it. And I bet my hair. You want these dollars? You're killing yourself, bro. Do you want them, or should I go to your neighbors! Did you piss on it? Just take them. Money doesn't smell, that's what people say. Plank, come here! Handsome, though. Here are the levs. Where are my dollars? Give him the dollars. Hey, Plank. You gonna stick around here? Come with me. Get off, please. You'll live here. My friends will help you - with the kid, with the school. If things turn out well, you might come to work for me. But for now, this is the right way. Get off, please. I'll never fancy another man, Techo. I only have eyes for you. May you have women, but be deprived of love. I kept building the temple of the rose by the river near the place where it all started. Dreams are always greater than prayers. It's very hard to deceive a dreamer. A lie may slow him down but will never stop him. How do you manage to spend so much money in no time? Last month I gave you 100 000 dollars. You not only spent all the money from the rose oil distillery, but you are trying to kill yourself with new loans every month. I pay you back, don't I? Along with the monstrous interest. You see... The temple of the rose requires a lot of money. Be careful, Techo! My head flies off if you ... I'll need some extra help. Shave my beard! Son, I've been watching you for years. The freedom you search for does not exist. It's an illusion... It's a prison... A prison! To be free means to choose your own prison. You're greedy. A man shouldn't be greedy. Money, women, freedom. Everyone has his own limits. Limits for all three of these. If a man goes over his limits, they crush him and that's all. He's finished. You were such a wild kid! Look at you now. So many people depend on you. Techo, you promised me! You promised me! Dad? You promised me! Roses will blossom - with or without us. Well... with us is preferable. I'm leaving you too soon, my son. Too soon... Yes, you left me too soon. We had so much to do together. Too soon! All left me! Fate left me too! Where are your workers, Stavri? They're packing and leaving. Oranges, olives, dishes - whatever pays. Germany, Spain... Who knows where. Where is that Terminal 2 that swallows our children like a dragon. Tell them not to leave. What for? Let them know that from now on I will double their pay! Don't do that! We'll lose everything. You'll fuck up the others, too. They'll kill us! What if the buyers disagree? That's a fucking suicide! First time ever, right? Emigration - the modern slavery. A subtle slavery that allows for the illusion of freedom. 2.5 million Bulgarians have left the country. Not a single war has caused so much damage. I thought you'd never come. You can use an extra hand. I can't buy your oil, Techo. These are hard times. Everyone produces, but there are no buyers, no markets. Turkey is crushing us. Turkey. Bulgaria. Bulgaria. Turkey. That's it, we're done. Now Bulgaria is missing from the rose oil map. So what do we do? Nothing but pray. - You're praying? - Yes. Leave that to the priests. Turkey you say. Turkey. Here's some water. That's for you. Hey girl. Girl... Just tell me who did it. Tell me who did it. Are you the big boss here, Techo? Fuck you! Are you... I'll kill you! An old acquaintance. That was a good beating. He's alive. Hey Scarface, do you hear me, scum? Do you get what I'm saying? Did they beat you up? I fell from my horse! Did Techo beat you up? Tell me! Tell me! I haven't seen him. I fell from my horse. A wild horse, maybe? You should have killed the scum, cousin. You should. He's one of yours. He pays you, not me. Don't be like that. He pays you to protect him when he steals, beats people, rapes his daughter. What about his daughter? The scum raped his daughter. Fucking life. Fucking country. Fucking scum. How long? I've served scums my whole life. Why? I served scums before, I serve them now. Stay away! - Wait, cousin! - Stay away! Get lost! For how long?! Cousin... I can't take it anymore. For how long?! Tell me! Why the fuck?! Why? Hasan Bey, Bulgaria and Turkey are the largest rose oil producers in the world. We were a leader until recently. The markets were yours, but now they're ours. It isn't our fault that your country has problems. We're making large investments in rose plantations. We have a good product. Western companies came with their investments. Leave us this much. 20%. Give us some room to breathe. There's terrible corruption in Bulgaria. The Communist elite switched sides. Now they are the rich ones who rip off the society. Other nouveau riche come from the criminal underground. We look after our business, you better fix your country. I can see you know very well the problems in Bulgaria. With all due respect, Hasan Bey, my forecast is that in 7-8 years you will have problems similar to ours. The wheel spins. Things may turn around. I don't see how. I will turn them around. Only time will show. May Allah be with you. Cousin, stop the car. Stop the car. Take me back to the clinic. Take me back. Hey cousin, I'll come to see you often. Don't worry about me. You're not a free man, cousin. I'm the free one among us. I started drinking. I really hit the bottom. I gave up. Did you forget me? I didn't forget you. I renounced you. Why did you stop dreaming? Because I became a slave. A slave of the state, to the banks, to the mafia, to their money, to my women, to my children. A slave to everything and everyone! It's a voluntary prison. And you leave it voluntarily too! Good morning! Techo, I've known you for ages. Why didn't you call me earlier? You sound like an abandoned lover. You don't understand, do you? You were dead. I've been drinking for three weeks. You would be dead on the third day. You really don't get it. Your condition is really serious. Some tests must be made. You've had symptoms long before, haven't you? Symptoms. I have symptoms as many as you like. I'll be going. Well, how do you want me to say it - delicately or outright? Delicately speaking, there is a tumor somewhere inside you. In the head? In the head. And? How much time do I have? Plenty of time if I cut it out. Prepare yourself for surgery. Well... And what if you don't cut it out? It will continue to grow and depending on how aggressive it is it could be months, weeks, tomorrow. Tomorrow? I see, you're afraid. You don't get it at all. No, it's normal. We're all afraid. But you're lucky because I am a really good surgeon. I am calling the team. You really don't get it. No, I don't. If you have to do something important and you can postpone it for tomorrow, will you do it today? What if you have no tomorrow? That thing in my head will remind me that I have no tomorrow. I don't get it. Where is the nurse? What nurse? I've run out of time. The dream stayed with me. The tumor in my head is not a verdict but a gift. A gift to make me realize that I have no tomorrow and that my past is gone, too. They exist only in my thoughts. Now I know how to deceive time. I've learned to live now, in the very moment. To be today is my tomorrow. Boss... - Hello, Stefan Bey. - Hasan Bey. That's my son. I underestimated your words, Stefan Bey. That's in the past. Now we need to work together to retain and expand our global markets. And by saying "our markets" I mean ours and yours. That's the responsibility that we have to deal with. So the war between us is over, do I get it right? There has been no war. It was just a misunderstanding that we don't have similar problems. The people are most important, Hasan Bey, the people. This is Gyula. She'll be in charge of our joint operations. Thank you, Stefan Bey. Let me show you the rose oil distillery. Techo, aren't you aiming too high, my boy? You bought the house of the biggest rose oil producer of the 20th century. You must be dreaming. I've been a dreamer all my life. Back to business. I have a very big request from an Asian buyer. I could manage the first year of the contract alone. Now I will need your help? and your rose oil. Just a moment! You are skipping me, Techo, and that's no good. You forget something important. I mix the oils and I do the trading. We have been making rose oil for 25 years. We have been giving it to you and have been waiting for your schemes, your filthy games with quantities, commissions and buyers. I got a letter from all the major buyers. They officially declare their will to work with me directly. Who will guarantee the quality? Who will sign the certificates? The first independent lab is ready. It is fully licensed. You can find all the details in this document. We're ready to certify and guarantee the quality of every producer's rose oil. We are ready to start right away. Thank you, Gyula. Now you have a choice. We can do this properly. We can produce and sell rose oil together. I emphasize together. We can just as well continue working with Mr. Kolev. My promise is to sell your oil first? One moment! ? commission free. I will sell mine last. The prices I will fight for will ensure the development of our business. The rest is up to you. I'm with you, my friend. I say yes! - Me too! - Me too. Me too. Techo, you have a yes from me. Yes. Me too. They call Bulgaria "The Land of Roses". In 2008 Bulgaria regained its leading position in the rose oil market due to the efforts of all private producers.
