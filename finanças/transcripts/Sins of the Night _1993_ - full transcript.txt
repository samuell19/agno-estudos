[BLUES MUSIC] JACK (VOICEOVER): Man, I don't understand certain women. And I don't get my own self-destructive tendencies. I really went out of my way to try and help her and cut myself a little slack in the process. But I almost got killed over it. Talk about getting cut on the wrong side of a con game. Well, partner. That's the easiest it's $4 million we'll ever make you. Think you got things a little mixed up, Ted. Oh, really? JACK: Put the gun down, Quincy. TED: I thought I told you to stay off this case, Nietzsche. Well, you know me. I've always had a problem with authority. No, your problem is you don't know about the deal Roxy and I cut. Is that right? Yeah, gonna split the insurance money on Falcone. I get her and the money. The only thing it looks like you get from here is a long prison term. Is that right? [GUNFIRE] JACK (VOICEOVER): But anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself. This whole business really began with the Laura Winters case, an insurance scam I was investigating. LAURA: Hi. Just put them on the kitchen table. How much is that going to be? YOUNG MAN: $30, ma'am. Thank you. Keep the change. Bye-bye. [KNOCK AT DOOR] All right. OK, I'll let him know. Bye-bye. Mr. Quincy. Mr. Quincy, that was the radio station. They're ready when you are. Put it through to my office. Let me know when Jack comes in. Theodore Quincy here. Nice to be on the show. HOST (ON PHONE): Thank you, Mr. Quincy. As you know, "Make a Difference" profiles people in the community who are making a difference. For those of our listeners who may not know of your involvement with the correctional facilities, why don't you give us a brief overview? Well, it really came about by accident. One of my employees had a relative who needed a job in order to qualify for a prison parole program. Anyway, I took a chance with him, and he's still with me today, over four years later. HOST (ON PHONE): I think our listeners should also know you're on the board of directors for Lend a Hand, an organization that coordinates early parole programs. Well, I just think, as a business man, it makes sense to tap into as many resources as possible. And I think that sometime in our lives we've-- we've all been in a position of needing a second chance. [R&amp;B MUSIC] Excuse me. You look a lot better in person. You must be Jack Nietzsche. That's right. Your real name Laura Winters? Maybe. Why? Look, lady, don't fuck with me. I've had a tough day already. I mean, hiding in the bushes outside your window, watching you miraculously rise up from your wheelchair, fucking your brains out for two hours with some moron. Although, that's not bad for a woman who was paralyzed from the waist down. What else do you know about me? JACK: I know you won a fat settlement from Anaconda Casualty Company. I know you quit your job. And now I know you're a liar. Prove it. It's my word against yours. What do you want? Surprise me. LAURA: Maybe this will cloud your memory a little bit. JACK: Things are getting a little fuzzy already. Now, why don't we just hammer out the details. Jack. I just wanted you to know that I get off now. I'm going to have to take a rain check on that. Don't wait too long, Jack. But I'll call you. JACK (VOICEOVER): So that was Laura Winters. Pretty hot looking, huh? And she fit in real nice with a little game I was running on my job with the Anaconda Casualty Company. [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] [INSECTS HUMMING] You awake? It's OK. TONY: Sorry I'm late. I got hung up downtown. Well, I was tired anyway. TONY: You smell great. Tony, I'm not a car. You can't just turn the key and start me up. Well, when did you become such a high class bitch? Maybe some people change. TONY: Yeah? Well, I liked you better the other way. Tony, I've got an idea. Why don't we try something new tonight? All right, I'm game. Like what? Conversation. Conversation, Rox. Hell, I don't think that's your strong suit. How would you know? TONY: Don't you forget where I found you. Why don't you get out of these things, get a little more comfortable. What do you think? Ah! [TELEPHONE RINGING] JACK (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): This is Jack. Do it at the beep. SUE ELLEN (ON PHONE): Jack? Are you there? This is Sue Ellen. Please pick up. I know you're there. Damn. We'll, if you get this message, you better get here right away. I don't know how much longer I can cover for you. Hurry up. OK. OK, let's go. Up and at 'em. [GROANS] JACK: Hey. How are you with coffee? Hello, Sue Ellen. Jack, where were you? He's waiting in your office. Rough night. You know, you're the only one that worries about me? How about a cup of coffee? OK. Hey. Uh-oh. Almost like somebody did get laid last night. Listen, smart ass, I don't need this. Now, either you get here on time like everyone else, or I'll just call the parole office and tell them things aren't working out. Understand? Quince, I was working. TED: On what? The Winters case. Anything? No, but I'm on top of her. Thanks. She loves me. TED: I want you to put Winters on the back burner. I want you on this now-- top priority. Aw, Quince, I'm swamped. I got a dozen things going. I don't care what you got going. Just do it. OK. I'm in love. That's Roxy. Back then, she was Roxanna Flowers, exotic dancer, All-American bitch. She beat us big time on a whiplash scam. Said it ruined her career, Then she dropped out of sight, just when I was about to nail her. I want you to find her. Find her, that's it? Quince, I'm not a private investigator. Don't we have somebody that can handle this? I'm telling you to do it, aren't I? Now, word is she's around. So find her. I'll get right on it. And wear this. JACK (VOICEOVER): The truth was I was interested. What was it about some stripper that would make Quincy have me drop everything to find her. Knowing him, she must have been a real freak. How you doing, Jack? Sue Ellen, you got that look going again. [LAUGHS] What look? That I want to take you home and have your baby look. I thought men like you didn't turn down opportunities, especially when it's a sure thing. Sue Ellen, I'm not the guy you're looking for. The kind of guy you want is from Kansas, carries home pictures of his kids in his wallet. That's just not me. Why don't you just stop feeling sorry for yourself, Jack? You're a terrific kid. Jack, would you stop playing with me? OK. A pie. Bake me a pie. I'm a sucker for a good apple pie. [JAZZ MUSIC] JACK (VOICEOVER): I checked out every strip joint, triple X arcade, and sleazy corner in Los Angeles. No Roxanne Flowers, not even a hint. She's not the sort of lady a guy easily forgets. So it was my guess that she was long gone. If I was going to find her, I needed to think up a new angle and pray for a lot of luck. Hello? You sound like you're out of breath. What are you doing? Cheating on me? Jack, no, I just ran from the back room. You know I'm saving it for you. Yeah, the check's in the mail. Jack, be nice. Listen, I've been on my feet all day. I need somebody to rub some life back in these tired muscles. Yeah? What's in it for me. Dinner and sex. In that order? JACK (ON PHONE): That's up to you. So how does it feel to fuck an ex con? Mm, if you were really an ex con, you would have tied me up. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Mm-hmm. You're a freak. You know that? Yeah. Remember me? Oh. Thanks. Roxanne Flowers. She's gorgeous. Starting a talent agency? JACK: Just work. Oh, with work like her, who needs play? Yeah. I'm doing this insurance thing. I need to find her. A woman like that shouldn't be too hard to find. Oh, you'd be surprised. I've asked everybody. And the best I can come up with is a guy who said he knew her from Woodstock. Well, that narrows it down to about 600,000. Cute. Look. Give me her picture. I'll pass it around the club. A lot of women go through there. No shit? All right, thanks. You're welcome. [JAZZ MUSIC] JACK (VOICEOVER): Someone, somewhere had to know something about this Roxanne Flowers. How could a woman who had some notoriety as a stripper just disappear? The streets weren't getting me anywhere. But I didn't have anywhere else to go. So I kept looking. [INSECTS HUMMING] KAY (ON MESSAGE): Hi, Jack. It's Kay. Listen, I might have something for you on that Roxanne Flowers. One of the girls seems to remember a friend of a friend who worked in a high class whore house in the hills owned by Tony Falcone. She thinks this Roxanne and Falcone got married. Anyway, she's going to try to pick up the address. So call me later. Bye. HOST (ON PHONE): The kind of whorehouses I knew about were sleazy phony massage parlors, with burned out sluts who always pitched for more money and still threw you a dead fuck. But this place was different, nice. I could be comfortable here fast. Reminds me of my place. May I help you? JACK: Yeah, I was told to ask for Danielle. I'm Danielle. I'm looking for a woman. What kind of woman did you have in mind? JACK: No, that's not what I mean. I'm searching for someone. I was told she worked here once. Are you a police officer? Do I look like a cop? Cops come in all shapes and sizes. I wouldn't know. My name's Nietzsche, Jack Nietzsche. I work for Anaconda Casualty Company. I'm looking for a woman, Roxanne Flowers. Sorry. Can't help you. Beautiful woman. Not the kind of face you forget, I suppose. Maybe you know by her married name, Roxanne Falcone? No. JACK: That's strange because I heard that Mr. Falcone owns this establishment. Well, maybe, you should talk to Mr. Falcone. All right. Thanks anyway. It's been real enlightening. Mr. Nietzsche, any relation to the philosopher? Yeah, I'm his twin brother. Oh, Mr. Nietzsche, do you mind telling me who referred you to me? That wouldn't be very discreet of me now, would it? LES: Yeah, I can get you in to see Falcone. But I'm sure he's not going to appreciate a friend of mine questioning him about his wife who may or may not be the lady who ran an insurance scam, what-- five years ago? Yeah. I guess you're right. I don't know what the hell I'm talking about. Guess I'm going to have to just work another angle. That's all. Good luck. But remember, with someone like Falcone, you don't always get a second chance. Shit. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Yeah? MARY ELLEN (ON SPEAKER): Jack? There's a Ms. Ward here to see you. Who? MARY ELLEN (ON SPEAKER): She's not scheduled. She says she knows you. OK. Send her in. So we meet again, Ms. Ward. Sit down. You know, I was reading up on our friend Nietzsche, the philosopher-- you know, my twin brother. He says that men should be trained for war and women for the recreation of the warrior. Fascinating. Sounds like your line of work, recreation. I'll get right to the point, Mr. Nietzsche. I spoke with Roxane Flowers about you today. I thought you said you didn't know her. She's an acquaintance of mine. JACK: Why didn't you say so before? Because you showed up at my home unannounced. I didn't know who you were. And I'm not in the habit of giving out information to strangers. Especially in your business. I knew you'd understand. Ms Flowers is willing to meet you. She wants to clear this matter up. Well, actually, it's my boss, Mr. Quincy, that would like to speak to her. Sorry. She's agreed only to meet you. That's the way it's going to have to be. That's fine. Fine. When? Where? Any place but here. She said she'd explain why when she meets you. Fair enough. By the way, should I call her Ms. Flowers or Mrs. Falcone? Her friends all call her Roxy. [R&amp;B MUSIC] JACK (VOICEOVER): I began to understand what Quincy got all worked up about. Roxanne Flowers was pretty hot. I got a tape of her act in the mail, but no name and no return address. Obviously, someone was beating me. But who? And why? It didn't matter anyway. I was finally going to meet her. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [JAZZ MUSIC] How come something tells me that's here to see you? That, my friend, is Roxanne Flowers, a.k.a. Roxy Falcone. Oh shit. Don't worry. It's strictly business. Look, I don't want to hear anymore. Just take her somewhere where no one will see her. The last thing I need is Tony Falcone thinking his wife comes here to get laid. Scotch, soda, lime. I like a man with scotch on his breath. So you're Roxy Falcone? Better known as Roxanne Flowers. You've done your homework Mr. Nietzsche. I caught your act. It's out on video. I didn't know there were any of those still around. I watched it twice. Shall we discuss business, Mr. Nietzsche? Jack. Jack. I suppose Ted Quincy put you up this. The only reason I'm here is because I want him out of my life once and for all. Shucks. I thought you were here to see me. Another time, another place. I'm going to hold you to that. Quincy thinks I'm here to settle a fraudulent claim you made against Anaconda years ago. [SCOFFS] Is that what he told you? It figures. Excuse me? My claim was totally legitimate. I went to trial. I won. I collected. Those injuries ruined my career. Mr. Quincy thinks there's evidence to the contrary. That's a lie. Why would he make that up? Because he had a thing for me. He still has a thing for me. The only thing Ted Quincy caught me in was a weak moment, and we had an affair. Really? I never thought I'd envy Quincy anything. Go on. But like most men, he just couldn't leave it at that. He wanted me all to himself, his own private little recreation. So you and Ted had an affair-- how good could that have been? You're not too smart, are you, Jack? And you obviously don't know Ted Quincy. You want an education? Check out the safe in his office sometime. The point is I want to put an end to it-- all of it. Well, what can he do? I mean, really? Case is closed. Money's gone. Your married life goes on. Can he smear your name? No. Everybody knows you're a stripper. What's he going to do? Tell your husband you were a whore? I mean, that's where you met him. [SMACK] [JAZZ MUSIC] [INSECTS HUMMING] Who the fuck do you think you're dealing with here? I'm going to ask you once, nicely-- where were you tonight? I told you. I was with Danielle. Why was your car not here? One of the girls got stuck. I had to go get her. Remind me to have Danielle fire that bitch tomorrow. It's all right. It's over, all right? I'm OK. You just have to understand that when you go out, you tell me where you're going. Because you know why? Because you're mine, sweetie. And you're always going to be mine. You understand? Now, you want to make me happy? You know I do. I knew you'd say that. [R&amp;B MUSIC] I want you to dance for me. Tony, please. I want you to fucking dance for me. Dance! Come on, Roxy. You can do better than that. Come on, dance. Dance like you're going to make love to the music. That's not good enough. Come on. I want to see some skin. Take it off, Roxy. Yeah. Yeah, that looks good. Turn around. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That looks good. We have showtime. Yeah. You know what I want you to do? I want you to crawl to me. [CRYING] Tony, please. (ANGRY) I want you to fucking crawl to me. Get on your fucking knees and crawl to me! [CRYING] Crawl to me now. Crawl to me, you fucking trash! Yeah. That's a good girl. I knew you wanted to. Come to me. That's a good girl. I knew you would do that. [SOBBING] [SEDUCTIVE MUSIC] JACK (VOICEOVER): I couldn't figure out Roxy's game yet. Maybe she liked to be treated the way Falcone treated her. Maybe she deserved to be treated like that. Some woman suck you in that way, and then fuck you in the end. One thing I did know, I wanted more than Roxy. I wanted everything Falcone had-- the house, his woman, his business, the power-- all of it. If an asshole like Falcone could have it, why not me? OK. Good job. Now, I'm taking you off the case. I'll handle it from here. What are you talking about? Just what I said. You're out. I'm in. Putting you back on the Winters' case. Hey, wait a minute, Quince. Don't jerk me around like I'm some fucking punk. You don't get it. Do you, Jack? You are a punk-- my punk. And punks do what they're told, or they get sent back to prison. You're bullshit, Quince. This has nothing to do with insurance, and you know it. Oh, is that right? Is that what Roxy told you? She didn't need to tell me anything. It's written all over your face. Now, let me do my job. [LAUGHS] Your job? Your job is what I tell you it is. Don't push your luck, Jack. You're just a fucking ex-con on parole. And nobody loves a con. Is there anything else, Jack? Uh, no, thanks. Let's call it a day. OK. Good night. Wait up. I'll walk with you. Say, did you ever bake me that pie? ROXANNE (ON MESSAGE): Jack, this is Roxy. I have to talk to you. I'll be at Danielle's after 9. Please come. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] JACK (VOICEOVER): I knew I was meeting Roxy at 9:00. So why did I go to Sue Ellen's apartment? Maybe she was right about me. I just couldn't pass up a sure thing. Come on in, stranger. Join the party. Do you want a drink? [LAUGHS] I've never seen you like this before. You look different. You're not going to try to take advantage of me, are you? [LAUGHS] Shouldn't I be the one who's worried? I mean, after all, you are Jack Nietzsche. Ta-da! La piece de résistance. You're not going to have any? No. We bombshells have to watch our fingers. OK. Almost as good as sex. [LAUGHS] No, really, everything has been great. I haven't eaten like this since Thanksgiving dinner in the joint. [LAUGHS] Wait here. I'll be right back. Sue Ellen? SUE ELLEN: In here. Listen, it's getting kind of late. I think I should be going. SUE ELLEN: Damn. Jack, could you come in here a minute? Oh, jeez. Mm-hmm. Don't you want to see if sex is still better than apple pie? [LAUGHS] Oh, no, no. Hey, no. No, Jack. Don't go! Please, don't go. Come on. I want you to fuck me. I know what you need. You need me. Huh? Yeah, you do. Let me show you. Let me show you. Let me show you. Come on. Come here. Come here. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey! (ANGRY) I guess you've got better things to do than to fuck me, huh? Sue Ellen. Sue Ellen, I'm sorry. I never should have come here. Can't we just be friends? No, we can't. Just go away! I don't want to leave like this. Go. Just get out of my life. Get the fuck out of my life! Leave! JACK (VOICEOVER): Sure thing or not, I had to keep focused. Falcone had what I wanted. And the way to get that was through Roxy. ROXANNE: You're pretty sure of yourself, aren't you? I'm not a hooker anymore. I don't need money. What do you need? ROXANNE: You've got all the answers. Why don't you tell me? I'd say you need a man, someone who doesn't give a shit you are a hooker, but let's Roxy be Roxy. Right. Sounds nice. But what's in it for you? I don't know. Man's a simple animal. He has simple needs. That's the problem with men. They think life's so simple. Why don't we just start simply and work our way up. Jack. [JAZZ MUSIC] Jack's in an awful hurry. Well, you have more company, Darling. Who is it? DANIELLE: Ted Quincy. He must have seen Jack because he doesn't look happy. Stall him a few minutes. Then send him to my room. So? You're finally starting to see things my way. Do I have a choice? May as well make the best of it. Smart girl. What did Nietzsche want? Take a guess. A lot of women find him attractive. In a way. He can't do anything for me though. He's just a trick. That's what I like about you, Roxy. You always got your eye on the brass ring. You only go around once, Ted. Shall we? It's been a long time. TED: Where the hell you been all night? You were out having sex, weren't you? Look at you. You're nothing but a fucking tramp. I bet you're not wearing panties, are you? You like it when I don't wear panties, don't you? Shut up! I can just imagine what you're thinking when you're out at bars dressed like that, with nothing on underneath. Well, I think I'm a whore, Ted. And I think you like the idea of me screwing other men. I was with another man tonight, Ted. You like that, don't you? Hmm? Maybe I was with more than one man. Maybe I was with a lot of different men-- a lot of different men. Shut up, you fucking slut. That's all you ever were-- a fucking slut. Well, what if-- (WHISPERS) what if one of those men followed me home tonight? What would you do, Teddy? Maybe he's outside right now, huh, looking at us. What would that make you do, Teddy bear? I'll fucking kill you, whore. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] JACK (VOICEOVER): I didn't sleep well that night. I kept thinking about Roxy. (ECHOING) She was really getting to me. I was starting to like her-- sexy and smart-- my kind of woman. I don't fall in love easily, and I felt myself slipping. It made me uncomfortable. When you didn't respond to my letter, Mr. Nietzsche, I became concerned, and I contacted Mr. Quincy. As you know, the terms of your parole require a satisfactory work report. Yeah. So how am I doing? Mr. Quincy feels that your work performance hasn't been up to his standards. Specifically, there are instances of absence and tardiness. A bottle of liquor was found in your desk and reports of association with the wife of an organized crime figure. You want to know how many times I jerked off last week? This isn't an occasion for flippancy, Mr. Nietzsche. OK. OK. When's the execution? For the time being you can remain here. Next week, a determination will be made whether to remand you back to prison. Great seeing you again, Uncle Ted. Laurel, you get more beautiful every time I see you. Say hi to your dad for me, huh? I will. Next week, Mr. Nietzsche. Uncle Ted? What the hell was that about? Sorry, Jack. I want you out of here by the end of the day. You never could leave her alone, could you? Case closed, Nietzsche. You're history. Goodbye. You want to go back to prison, Jack? Let me tell you something. As far as Roxy's concerned, you were nothing but a pity fuck from day one. Is that right? And how the fuck would you know? Get the fuck out of here before I call security. It's too bad dead hookers can't talk. I'm sure your ex-wife had a hell of a story. Danielle Ward. JACK (ON PHONE): Hi, Danielle. This is Jack. Oh, hello, Jack. JACK (ON PHONE): Yeah, I need to speak to Roxy. Is she there? No, I'm sorry. She isn't. Can I take a message for her in case she calls? Just tell her I was thinking about her, OK? OK. Bye-bye. He was thinking about you. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. [TELEPHONE RINGING] JACK (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): This is Jack. Do it at the beep. ROXANNE (ON MESSAGE): Jack, this is Roxy. I wish you were there. Your office said you were gone. Right after you left last night, Quincy came by. He must have followed you. He forced his way into Danielle's. He took me into a room-- Roxy, where are you? Where are you? You're OK? All right. Come over here. I don't care. Make an excuse. Just get over here. You were right. I checked out Quincy's friend to his ex-wife. Unbelievable. She was a prostitute, you know? He was a suspect in a murder. I know. And now you've taken her place. Jack, he forces me to dress up in a blonde wig so I look like her, tell him things I do with other men. Really? Don't you see? That's what Quincy's all about. He loves prostitutes. He loves everything about them. Only when he found out Mrs. Quincy was fucking everything around him, threatening to leave him, he couldn't handle it. He flipped out. That's why I think he killed her. He might do it again. What are you talking about? She's dead. She is. But you're not. [BLUES MUSIC] Where's this going, Jack? That depends. I hope depends means Ted and Tony. You come with a lot of baggage, lady. We both come with a few strings attached. But the point is what are we going to do about it? Why don't we cut the bullshit and throw some cards on the table? Get out, Jack. Stop thinking with your dick for a change and do the right thing. JACK: Look, Les, I got a hot piece of ass on the line. And if I play my shit right, I'm going to step right into Falcone's shoes. Since when has a piece of pussy ever paid you dividends? There's always a first time. No pussy-- repeat-- no pussy is worth what Falcone's going to do to your ass when he finds out you've been sniffing around his old lady. You know he keeps that bitch on a tight leash. Hey, hey! Is any of this getting through to you? Yeah, I hear you. But what the fuck, huh? LES: What the fuck? TONY: Hello, Quincy. TED: Hello, Tony. Long time no see. What can I do for you? I hear you've been investigating my wife. Who told you that? TONY: It doesn't matter. How is Roxy, anyway? You know, she and I go way back. So I hear. TED: She still as hot as she used to be? You know how some women get as soon as they're married, everything starts hanging out. Sad to think that might have happened to Roxy. Stay away from her. Take it easy, Tony. You don't know what you're talking about. Is that right? Yeah. Isn't this about an old claim Roxy filed with my company? TONY: Yeah, an old claim. That was reopened by one of my new agents. I don't even know about it. What agent? Jack Nietzsche, an ex con. Cheer up, Tony. I fired him today. Case closed, courtesy of Anaconda Casualty Company. Well, did this agent have anything to say about Roxy? As a matter of fact, he did. He said they can't seem to fuck each other enough. Well, that didn't take long. Word's out. Falcone has put a contract out on your ass. You don't seem surprised. I'm not. I wouldn't go home if I were you. Yeah. No shit. Somebody set you up real good, huh, friend? Yeah. It was Quincy. He used to be a cop. Probably bumped heads with Falcone long before Roxy ever came along. That's why he sent me to track her down. He knew Tony would find out about it sooner or later. Then he makes up some bullshit about me and Roxy. Bullshit? What bullshit? It's true. Anyway, Tony takes care of me, and Quincy's in the clear. So what the fuck you going to do now? You've got some nerve. I'm in trouble. I need a place to stay. Did I catch you at a bad time? Actually, it's a good time. I'm going away for the weekend. So you can have the whole place to yourself. There's a spare set of keys in the kitchen. Make the bed and lock up before you leave. Thanks. You know me. I'm a sucker for lost causes. Still friends? Let me know when you come to your senses. He came to my office for Christ's sake, like the fucking godfather. I have a business to run, a standing in the community. All I told him was Anaconda was investigating me. What do you think, huh? You think you're the only one he bullies around? You just find a way to keep him off my back. There's a $4 million insurance policy on Tony in my name. You can't be serious. I'm dead serious. 50/50, Ted, $2 million. I'm talking me and more money than you ever dreamed of. Why don't you call Jack? Isn't that more up his alley? Jack's a dead man, and you know it. (WHISPERING) I could be her all day long. We could go out together in public, not worry about anybody seeing us. She'd be alive again. Think about it, huh? A new wife, and no one would know she's a prostitute. Kill Tony Falcone-- that's crazy. You know it's only a matter of time before he finds out about us. Why not deal with it now before he suspects anything. It's all so easy for you, isn't it? I think there's a bit of a killer instinct in both of us. What if I like things the way they are? Then maybe your friends-- the people you do business with in your standing in the community-- will get a big kick out of this. [SIGHS] To us. To us-- and to stupid, greedy, foolish men. [LAUGHTER] (SOUTHERN ACCENT) Ah, the knight in shining armor. And as predictable as rain. That's my cue. Wish me luck. Break a leg. Jack, thank goodness. Quincy was just here. He was looking for Roxy. Well, where is she? She just called. Tony's drunk, and he hit her. He says he's going to kill you. Motherfucker. Is she still there? DANIELLE: No, she just ran out of here. She said she was going to your place. Give me her car phone number. DANIELLE: I have it in here somewhere. It's funny. I didn't see her leave. I was watching the house. Oh, you must have missed her somehow then. All right, look, I don't have time for this. You find the number, call her. Tell her to meet me at 1625 North Oakhurst. OK, 1625 North Oakhurst. Yeah. Tell her I'll meet her there. OK. Hurry, Jack. It's amazing. It's so easy. You pull a string, they jump. [LAUGHS] To jumping men. All right. Make me irresistible. Harder. Harder! Again! Again! Again! Again. [CRYING] Tony, you bastard. JACK: Does it hurt? ROXANNE: No. Jack, what are we going to do? I don't know. Things are complicated. Life is complicated. I got a lot to think about. And I bring a lot to the table-- me, Tony's money, the businesses, the house, the investment. Those are things a man doesn't give up easily. Jack, until Tony and Ted are out of the way, we can't have what we want. One wants to kill you. The other one wants to send you back to prison. Well, what do you want? I want everything. So how did Tony leave it with Quincy? Quincy blamed everything on you. He's going to give Tony all the papers for my old insurance claim. Good. That's good? Yeah, because you're going to tell Tony how it was Quincy who always wanted you, threatening you, forcing you to have sex with him. And then, sayonara, Quincy. But that still leaves Tony. Well, funny thing about guys in Tony's line of work, they always wind up dead. Oh, Jack, we're finally on the same wavelength. And we're not fucking. What's the matter? What do you think Danielle has to do with all this? Why do you ask that? Just a hunch. Danielle works for Tony. I-- don't worry. I'll handle Danielle. Ted? Roxy. Tonight's the night. Tony wants Danielle and me to put on a little show for him. So he won't be expecting you. I'll leave the den window open. I'll make it look like someone broke in-- 9 o'clock, don't be late. Jack? Roxy. Quincy's coming by after 10 o'clock tonight. Make sure when you come, it's at least 10. We'll be having company until 9:30 or so. OK. I have to go now. [R&amp;B MUSIC] JACK (VOICEOVER): The truth was I still wasn't sure where everything fit. But I was sure about one thing-- for Roxy to get what she wanted, she needed me. And I needed her desperately. I should have stayed clear of Falcone's that night. But the idea of being with Roxy and running Falcone's operation was too good to pass up. It was a totally reckless, stupid thing to do. But at the time, I figured, what the hell? It's worth a shot. Need a fourth? TONY: What the fuck are you doing here? I always hate to miss a party. TONY: Well, this is one party you should have missed. Quincy, you always were a fool. And if you're not careful, you're going to be a dead fool. I don't think so, Tony. Don't you know cops always win? Bravo, ladies, nice performance. Congratulations on a job well done. What the-- bitches! Ahh! Well, partner, that's the easiest $4 million we'll ever make. The night's still young, ladies. I don't see any reason to break up the party. Do you? I think you got things a little mixed up, Ted. Oh, really? JACK: Put the gun down, Quincy. TED: I thought I told you to stay off this case, Nietzsche. Well, you know me. I've always had a problem with authority. No, your problem is you don't know about the deal Roxy and I cut. JACK: Is that right? TED: Yeah. We're going to split the insurance money on Falcone. I get her and the money. I'm in. You're out again, Jack. I don't think so. The only thing it looks like you get from here is a long prison term. Shut up. ROXANNE: Is he dead? TED: Cops never miss. Say hello to your wife for me. Danni, we won. Now we have everything. Congratulations. Jack. You're OK. No shit. Bullet-proof vest-- no more bullets, Rox. Oh, I'm so glad you're-- Don't, don't-- just don't. Save it for the next chump, all right? ROXANNE: What are you doing? Calling the police. Time to turn you two lovebirds in. What? Jack, don't be stupid. You can have it all now. Don't you see? $4 million, me, Tony's businesses-- come on, don't tell me you haven't thought of that before. Interesting. But I don't think so. I don't want to always be checking my back. And I've got this thing about staying alive. Hello? Yeah, there's been some shots up at Tony Falcone's house. That's right. Tony Falcone. ROXANNE: Look who's so fucking high and mighty. You turning us in? That's right. I didn't kill anybody. You did. That's what I saw. Your prints are all over that gun. And I was never here. Tell that to the police. JACK (VOICEOVER): Looking back on it now, it's not hard to understand how everyone became obsessed with Roxy, each in his own way. Roxy provided everything a man fantasizes about in a woman-- beauty, sex, danger. A man is willing to risk a lot for a woman like her. Me, I was greedy. I saw a way to make an easy life for myself and get the woman of my dreams. So I went for it and got screwed. The funny thing is, I think I saw it coming all along. The scary thing is, I'd do it again. [BLUES MUSIC]
