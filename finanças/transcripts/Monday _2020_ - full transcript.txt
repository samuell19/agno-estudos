I really like that shirt you're wearing. Oh yeah. This was your band? Yeah, that was... And you had t-shirts? - We did.

No, we got a deal. - Don't fucking start that. - You got a deal. And we were just there for the ride. - So tell me what happened. - What really happened was, we fucking got our deal. We made our album, it was fantastic. Okay. We take the album on tour, right? Tour's amazing as well. Right at the fucking end, at peak, peak success, this fucking guy, this Mickey go lucky goes solo. Out of nowhere. Leaves us hanging. I went to New York because I didn't really have a choice. And you were doing your own thing and you went- you had a choice. - And you had your own thing - yeah, what else - was I supposed to do. - Because it was the bastian show, and it was great. - We made that band. - And it was great. You became super famous, you got like 18 million followers. You're good on Instagram, whatever. Yeah, I had to go make an album because you fucking left. And I think it's a great album. - It's not the fucking point. - Come on, I love it. No. No, fuck you. You know what, he kept every fucking bad review the band got. Every single one. Why keep them? 'Cause I don't, I can't... I wanted to improve tell her why. - And I wanted to know... - Every single one. I wanna know - what everyone thinks. - No, you done it because you fucking hate yourself. That's your fucking problem. That's not, that's not... You are not happy unless you're failing. - Whoa. - And that's why you left the band. Wow. So I guess I'll get happy with another drink, I mean, you know. - Yeah, fucking get me one. - Oh no, fuck. Jesus. I'm gonna put some music on. Okay, put some music on. Hey, what the fuck are you doing? What does it fucking look like I'm doing? Oh god, come on, let's go. Grandma's asleep, don't fucking... Come on, let's go, let's go. For fuck's sake. Do you ever think about coming home? No. Why think about it? I think you should come home. Like, people have changed. Hey. Hey, babe. Hey. Do you wanna... - Do you want some? - Can you hurry up? I need to pee. Okay, yeah, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right out. Fuck. Anything I said? Oh bug. Are you even serious? - Yeah. - Yeah? Like what, met your kid serious? No, no, she hasn't met him yet. But she's going to, she's... I got a fucking kid now. - I know. - What the fuck! I mean, I saw that. I couldn't believe that. Like, how the fuck have we got kids? We're getting old. Listen. I think we should start writing again. Like seriously. I've got fucking six months left. Come with me. We can start writing on the road. It will be great. No, look. I'm fucking sick of doing the same shit over and over. They sent me to work with these fucking weird guys in New York, la. They've got fucking plaques on the wall, blah, blah, blah. I work with fucking maroon 5. We fucking hate maroon 5. I mean, think about it. All right, yeah. Like, I miss you. Come with me. Is it true you're only happy when you're failing? No. I'm so sorry about that. - Everything okay? - Yeah, fine, thank you. Again, I'm really sorry we have to do this here. I'm still between offices at the moment. That's fine. Thank you for squeezing me in. No problem and I'm really sorry about the noise. We're both trying to work from home today, so... Okay, so, the reason that there was a problem with your j-1 is because you already held that status of a researcher in the us. So you're no longer, you don't meet the eligibility criteria. Does that make sense? - Wow. - Good job, man. - Beautifully shot. - Good job, yeah. Nice music, man. Okay, are you done congratulating each other, okay, yeah? No. This is totally not what we discussed. And it's total crap. - Total crap? - This is a total crap. Total crap, and there is a basic, very basic reason for it. It has no greekness that kinda comes from the Greek soil, from the Greek nature, from the mentality... Can you stop interrupting me? Would you mind not smoking, also? No, I like smoking in my house. It's okay, it's okay. Manos, he can smoke. - Is it okay if I smoke? - Of course it's okay. Go on. Let's get the briefing first. I'm trying to help you here. Yeah, the briefing was, you know, a little funny. The briefing is that we simply need something that has modernity, that is the same- - contemporary. - Contemporary, but at the same time, it conveys a feeling of greekness. Something that the Greek audiences can relate to. And this is not? This is not? It's something that you obviously don't understand. So this is what you think when I tell you greekness? This is what you come out with? You come out with a bouzouki as if we were... I wanna play it safe 'cause I feel like you want something more safe, so I... Cut the fucking bouzouki. I'll cut the bouzouki. - Thank you. - If we combine, manos, if we combine the bouzouki now with the modern style... We'll try something else. What the fuck is this? Like, this is an amateur night. Sorry, I have a client. I am the fucking client here, okay? Yeah, yeah, we'll be all right, we'll be quiet, sorry. I'm sorry. That's okay. I would have booked an appointment, but... There's not enough time. Christos said... Said that you're a wizard. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Christos? Sioutis christos. He... He spoke very highly of you. He's the reason I called. Oh... Okay. I'm so sorry. I'm really embarrassed but I've just realized I can't take on another client right now. Wait, sorry, you can't help me? I mean, did I do something wrong? No, of course not, it wasn't you. It's not you, it's me and I really apologize. But I'm gonna have to show you out. I'm so sorry. Sorry, am I not being as clear as possible here? We need something- no, you're actually being very contradictory with yourself. I'm not contradictory with myself, man. Guys,. Contemporary briefing. That could mean one, two, three, four, five different things. Give me a minute. I'm gonna talk to the guy. I can bring up the musicians that can fucking do that in a snap. - Hey. - Sorry. Are you finished? - Oh god. - I'm sorry. I told you that might happen. I mean, it seems to take so long. Does anyone actually care whether you use a keyboard or- - I care. A little bit, I care. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. I meant them, you know? It must be frustrating for you. You're talented, you know what you're doing and it's... Embarrassing, it's embarrassing. No, I'm not... Yeah, it's just, you know. It's just a fucking jingle, you know, it's all it is. It's just a fucking little jingle. No, that's not what I'm saying. Stop, please, stop. We've both had a really shitty day. We got one more shot. - Yeah, yeah. - One more shot! So good, all right. - It's gonna be great. - Let me see him out. - Very Greek. - Take it easy, huh? Sure. Sure. See you tomorrow, man. Hey. Why? No, it's okay. Yeah, yeah, fine. What happened? No, argyris and manos, you know, they can't come over until two, you know. Okay, so they don't come over then. Well, it's not that easy. We have a deadline. Explain to me what you're saying. I have to finish the thing. This fucking jingle thing. Well, you have to come with me to see your ex girlfriend. This is what you have to do. - Don't start laughing at me. - I'm not. No, no, no. - Let's talk about this. - No, you are coming... No way! We are not talking about this. You cannot leave me. - Don't try that with me. - I'm not leaving you. I'm not leaving you. You know what I think? I think it's better. Let me tell you why. Hold on. I'm not letting you tell me anything. No, no, and you're this fucking sexy lawyer who just can convince anybody of everything. - Mickey, no. - You're amazing and you're walking like the light and she's fucking crazy. Mickey. Listen to me, listen to me. It's gonna go wild in two seconds. And if I'm there, she's gonna get all hysterical and try to... First of all, she's gonna be all jealous. She's gonna try to one-up you and it's about... But what about the party? Why don't we... Party's gonna be great. Yeah, but we can cancel this. I'll have everything ready. I'll have everything ready. Listen. It's just this one time, I promise. I'm laughing but this is not funny. - It's just this one time. - And you can't... Come on, I'll have sex with you. You wanna have sex with me? - Let's go. - Never. - I'll do that thing. - Never again. - You know that. - I hate you. - Come on. - I hate you. You're the best. What about now, man? This is Greek. What do you think? - Greek. - Fantastic, fantastic. Gorgeous. - Hold on. - Okay, okay. Are you joking? Can we just... Thank you. All right. So, okay, tell you the truth, okay? I appreciate the work that I've seen that you've invested but the truth is, come on argyris now, you know. This music is totally not what we're talking about. - Oh man. - This is for fairs. Like where gypsy people go. - Manos, sorry, I... - For fairs? I honestly... - For fairs. - That's the truth. Let's go, we can... I want what I asked, argyris. You know very well what I want. We can also go with one more. - We'll try one more. - Okay. - One more, okay. - You want one more? - Go one more. - One more, last one. Okay. I love this. Yes! That's it, man. Yeah! Yeah, that's perfect. That's what we talk about, man. - Are you joking? - No, I'm not fucking joking. That's perfect. The minute I hear it, I see images. - I immediately... - It's familiar. It rings home. It rings home. - It feels familiar, but... - It feels familiar, it has images. It reminds me of my grandma, my grandfather. It combines the elements. I mean, I see pictures. I don't have to see the actual video. I can imagine it just by the sound. Total. This is what you put in the brief. This is the thing you gave me. Okay, man. This is like totally, totally disrespectful. You like it. I'm here, I'm trying to get you a fucking job. You like it, so use it. I'm not here because I like you. I'm here because argyris asked me to come. Mickey, sorry. Fuck off. Hello. There's a reservation under aspa karra? Yep. This side. Aspa, hi. I'm Chloe. Nice to meet you. Look at you. You're at his age, aren't you? I'm older, actually. That's funny. Why funny? Should we order? Sure. After you. No, go ahead. I insist. So... Am I meeting Mickey's attorney or his girlfriend? Oh, he's not a client. Why isn't he here? I asked him not to come. That's a great idea. You knew he would do something stupid, didn't you? Aspa, I know this is difficult but Mickey really wants a relationship with his son. - Oh, does he? - Yes. - And you know about it? - Yes, I know that. I know him. You know nothing. You don't know what you're doing, you don't know where you are. Mickey can't be bothered to learn one single word in Greek to communicate with his own son. So he has to rely on Hector's English. Look, that was then, and this is now. I'm here because I... Look... Mickey is not the same as he was six years ago. Mickey is a baby. He's a little boy. Will you be happy with that? I don't need to talk to you what I'm gonna be happy with. It's so fucking Greek. It reminds me of the aegean sea and athenian women rising... And I see the corn, I see my grandmother coming out of the grave! And so but the Greek is there. And he's like playing the flute and eating the fucking souvlaki and taking humus. No, humus is not Greek, man. - Humus is not Greek. - Then tahini. - Is tahini? - Yeah, tahini, yeah, yeah. - Tahini is Greek. - Hey. Hi. How was it? Yeah, she's young, beautiful. She's fucking angry. Well, of course she's angry. She saw you, look how beautiful you are. Did you do the food? I have a plan. So you didn't make the food? Because I have a plan, I'm gonna surprise you. All I asked you to do was make the fucking food, Mickey. Okay. Can I help you? It's delivery for Mickey. Okay, thank you. How much is that? It's 52.60. One second. This was your plan, to order in food? Here you... Falafel, souvlaki. It's good, right? - It's good. - Yeah, some more Sushi. Hey, are you good? - Yeah, I mean... - Come on, it's funny. Really, is it though? Yeah. You know, it's real. It's like we don't care, but we care, that kind. Yeah, I care. I know. That's good. Yeah, it's not for now, argyris. Yeah, okay. - Now just... - Very good that. Oh my god. Thank you so much for coming. I didn't know if it was a birthday party. Should I bring a present? Yeah, we're calling it a pointless party because there isn't any point to it. But we just wanted everyone to meet, you know? But it's great to give parties. No one throws parties any longer. That's exactly what we said. - No! - So, this is home. So, you're not house sitting? No, this is Mickey's... This is Mickey. - Mickey, this is elli. - Hi! Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. You want a falafel? I'll have one later. - Okay. - Great. - Yeah, so that's Mickey. - So that's your boyfriend? - Yeah. - Okay. So are you still in kolonaki? No, we moved to the northern suburbs. Kostas and I. My fiance. Oh my god! That is a rock. - Wow! - No, it's great. Oh, congratulations, I'm so happy. Thank you, Chloe. Well, I wish you the same, you know? Oh well. Let's go get a drink. Yes, I need a drink. Hey, what are you doing, man? I ordered this one. Nobody ordered, it's a buffet, you share. Oh, it's okay, this is good for me. Come on. - Hey, Mickey! - Hey, wow. Look at you. Got a little beer. Looking good, looking good. Thank you. Thank you so much. It's great that you put together, you know, his people, your people. It's really fun. I wanna introduce you to somebody. Excuse me for just a second. - Oh, okay. - Come with me. So, you guys are both from London. So, I thought I should introduce you. Johnny, Tim. Tim, Johnny. Hey Johnny, how are you, man? - Good. - Can I get you a drink? Ah, do you havejuice? - Orange? - Is it fresh? - Yes. - Okay, great. Okay. So yeah, where are you from in London? Dagenham. All right, so not kind of... Yeah. London too, huh? Well, I mean, Holland park. But I'm barely there. Kind of spending a lot of time here. Oh, what are you doing here? I'm doing a startup. Okay. It's called your home. It's sort of housing solution for the global citizen. So places like this, you just get in, rip these places out and make these cool, quite functional pods. Well, we're trapped in this bar in Switzerland because it was like six feet of snow outside. Oh, yeah! You guys, you put like 200 francs into the jukebox and played "last Christmas" on repeat 100 times. - That's so embarrassing. - I love that song. They were so fucking wasted, you know. And christos, you know, he threw... He's a good guy, that guy. He threw down 3,000 francs on the table, you know? And everybody was doing shots. I don't remember. And he looks very, very nice. Yeah, he's a really good guy. He is. It's fine. You want a drink or not? Yes, I would like a vodka please. Sure. Dude, it's fucking disgusting what you're doing and you should be ashamed of yourself, seriously. I should be ashamed of myself? What do you do? What do you do with your life? Mate, I left London 'cause London was like fucking ridiculously expensive, I couldn't afford to live there anymore- - because you don't have a job, probably. I guess you don't work. Mate, you're a fucking cock. Oh, okay. Cheers, mate. Wow, I'm so glad that went so well. - That's yourjuice. - Thank you so much. You know, it's funny, like people always do that. "Oh, you're from London" kind of like when you're gay, like, "oh, hey, meet my gay friend." Oh, you're such a dick. Wow, okay. You wanna come and have some food with me? - Sure. - Sure, let's do that. - Really nice to meet you. - Okay. It's like having 100% of your daily nutrients for less than 800 calories. And it's raw and it's vegan. For 300 Euros? Guys, hey. Have you met these guys? This is miltos, orpheus, dimitrios, prometheus and Greg. - Are you making fun of me? - This is Stephanie. No, no, no, Stephanie. Where are you from, Stephanie? Athens, you fucking moron. Oh, you're a bit aggressive, Stephanie. Where from Athens? Because I have the ability and you don't. Sorry, baby. I'm speaking English to an American because it's polite. Same reason I don't turn up like a shit in fucking cargo shorts. Sorry, pussycat. Sorry. Are they your friends? - Are they your friends? - He is a shit, he is a shit. - Good for you. - Bye bye, bye bye! Oh, fuck. Argyris, what the fuck are you doing, man? You shit in your pants, do you know that? You shit in your pants. What? - Come on. Come on. - Oh fuck! Get up. What the fuck did you drink for fuck's sake? - Oh shit. - Fuck. Shit. Hold on, hold on. Oh. You know, I've gotta tell you, manos texted. They hated the song, they said it's shit. Awesome. You almost got my drink. - I'm sorry. Almost. - Almost. Cheers, Stephanie. Yeah, Stephanie. Bottoms up. Oh my god! Oh my god! - Stephanie! - What? - What happened? - What's going on? - Are you okay? - Oh my god, what happened? Guys, what did you do? They put something in my drink. Guys, come on! I'm gonna fucking sue you. Thank you, guys. Bye. Thank you so much for coming. Bye. Oh my god. That could not have gone worse. Oh, fuck. This is, it's so hot. It's okay. How do you feel? Don't worry. It will be over soon. We'll talk later. You will be experiencing some cramps. - Yeah. - That's to be expected. Okay. - Don't worry. - Oh yeah. And try to take it easy the next days. Yeah, I'll try. Do you smoke? Yes. Can I have a cigarette? In here? 'Cause it's not allowed. Thank you. Thank you. Fuck. Careful, it's really hot. Thank you. Thanks. So they didn't say what it was? Well, it's like a stomach flu. It's what they told me. What time is she coming? A couple of hours. Okay. I'll be alright. I'm sorry you feel shitty. You still look good though. I don't actually know what this window is for. But it's safe. I'm not here to inspect, it's not my job, but my client, Ms. Karras, insisted to make sure that Hector will spend time in a safe environment. - Yeah, absolutely. - Yeah, of course. I know the whole situation is awkward, but... No, of course, it's fine. Absolutely. - Should I show you his room? - Oh yeah. His room is over here. Yeah. This way. You both live here? - Yeah. - Yeah. For how long? - A few years. - Six months. I moved in six months ago. So, this is... Yeah. It's nice. You understand that Hector's mother has assigned guardianship and visitation rights to the both of you. Oh. Both of you, as a couple will be legally allowed to take unsupervised custody of Hector for the allotted time period stated on the documents. - And... - Okay. So we just have to be there at the same time to see him. - Yes. - Okay. And that's the only way we can have access? Well, it can be overturned on appeal from either party, but provided you remain in a stable and committed relationship. Do you consider yourselves being in a stable and committed relationship? - Yeah. - Yes, of course, yes. Great. Nice room. Yeah, it's great. So yeah, anyway, there's... There's just this one other room here. This is the... It's your bedroom? Bedroom. And then that's it. That's pretty much it. Thank you very much. Yeah. You're welcome. - How are you feeling? - Okay. Just okay? That's not good enough. I can't, I can't, I can't. I'm sorry, I can't do it now. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's fine. I just wanna make sure you're feeling good, that's all. Yeah. Okay. Hi. Chloe gains. Hello, welcome. Chloe gains. - Yes, you're right here. - Great. This gentleman is your plus one? Mickey, yes. Yeah, plus one. - Thank you. - Enjoy your night. Thank you. Hey guys, smile. - Thank you. - Thank you. Hi guys. Okay. Maybe we can like... Hey, guys. Wow, hey, how are you? - Hey. - Perfect. What's up, you look fucking miserable. Well, it was a long journey. How was the ceremony? Oh, so good! There was this girl, elli's niece. She sang a song. She was fucking beautiful. And her voice made me hard. I sat in the church with a huge boner, like, what the fuck! I wanna meet her but I can't find her anywhere. Yeah, I'm gonna be sure to tell her to stay away from you. As far away from you as possible. No. - Oh, my friend is here. - One second, I'll be back. Where did you get that drink? There are people with trays with champagne and shit all over the place. Come on, I gotta get one. We really miss you. I know, and I miss you too. We talk about you all the time. All the girls they said to me "where is Chloe?" I say I don't know. You know what it's like. You meet somebody and you go into the bubble and all you can see is them, but I'm good. I'm okay. Okay. It's new but it's good. He's kind to you? Yeah, he's great. Okay. Then I like him. Yeah. I had to step out for a bit. You know, it was a lot. What happened with christos was a lot. What happened with christos is something else. Tonight, we'll have a lot of fun. A lot of fun. Yes. - Here's to that. - Tonight, a lot of fun. Hey. Oh, hey. Here you are. How are you? Okay? - I'm good. How are you? - Let me introduce you. This is, you remember Anna that I told you about? And Virginia and caterina. - Hi. - Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Are you okay? - Yeah. - You sure? Yeah. I'm gonna be right here. Okay, I'll come and find you. I'll be around here. Okay. Mickey. Mickey, is that you? Mickey, right? Vodka soda, double. Yes, please. I am keeping a tight hold of my drink tonight. Stephanie. How are you? Good. How are you doing? I'm fine. I'm glad you made it. I was always gonna make it. I think it's probably the first time they've seen each other since they broke up. He has this way of... I don't know, gas lighting people. Do you know gas lighting? Yeah, I know what gas lighting is. Because of all the family money and the connections, he thinks he can move people wherever he wants them. After he and Chloe broke up, he set her up with this big new job back in Chicago. Like it was nothing. So he got her a job, that's... That's nice. So... I'm here with someone. I'm very happy for you. I'm sure you are, I can tell. He's the reason I stayed in Athens. He is the reason? Just pure, innocent, romantic. Just love at first sight, right? It was, actually. So you were not picturing one of my biggest clients calling to ask me why their new hire had not shown up at her first day at work? I didn't wanna take a job that you had arranged for me. Since when? What's that... I don't wanna be controlled by you. Stop doing that, I fucking hate when you do that. Oh. Should you be drinking? My drinking is none of your fucking business, christos. We're finished. You need to stop embarrassing yourself. I'm embarrassing myself? Really? Embarrassing myself? Did you just say this? Look at you. Enjoy your night, Chloe. Fuck you. Talk to me, bro, you look like you're gonna kill someone. You're desperate to blow this thing up, huh? 'Cause it's still good? And you take good things and you turn them into shit. I've seen you do this. She loves you, and she makes you happy. And you fucking deserve this. Come on, say it. Say. Do you deserve it or not? Do you deserve it or not? I deserve it. Yes, you fucking deserve it. And you'd better fight for it and keep it. 'Cause it's the best fucking thing that ever happened to you. You either sort your shit out and decide you're worth something to someone or you die sad and alone and fucking perverted. Dammit! Come on. Come on. Ooh! That was fucking great. Can we give it up for this lovely woman, please? Yes! What a lovely woman and this lovely couple, these two people... - What's your name? - Loukas, loukas. Ah, loukas, what a man. So nice. Eleni is the name. Okay, good, are you having fun tonight? - Yeah. - Cool. Do you trust each other? - Yeah. - Oh, that's nice. Did you ask each other before you got here, how many people you slept with? Whose dick she sucked or anything like that... - Come on, buddy. - Don't worry, argyris. I got it. I'm so sorry, loukas. I'm sorry, hold on, please. The point is the past is the past, and it's about the future, right? Right, christos? Hey. It's somebody else's party, you know? Anyway, so it's not about the past. It's about the future. And when you meet someone that you wanna die with, that's the person you gotta hang on to. And I don't wanna die alone, iwanna die with you, Chloe gains. Okay? So, do you wanna die with me? Do you wanna... Hey, Chloe, look at me. You wanna be my future? - Mickey, stop. - Would you be my wife? Come on. Come on. - Come on. No, no. - Hey. - Please, come on. - Hey. Fuck. So we just don't have a sink now? What? We don't have a sink now. I called the guy, he was supposed to come yesterday. Baby, you have to call a professional. He is. He's a fucking plumber, okay? It's fine. - He's gonna come today. - It's been like this for three days. Don't start fucking with it unless you know what you're doing. I told you, just call someone, please. Calm down. - It's a fucking sink. - Don't tell me to calm down. The place is like... relax. Don't tell me to fucking relax, Mickey. Hector arrives on Monday. - The place is in shit. - So what? We're not gonna have to take him into the fucking kitchen, okay? He can go to his room. Oh, my god it's like living - with a fucking teenager. - We'll go to the fucking park it's not a big deal. No, I will have to fix it, like everything else. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get so upset. I think I'm just scared. I'm scared. Well, I've had an idea. Was it... I bought you this. It's a book of songs in Greek. But I thought we could learn a kid song. And then we could get him to sing. There's like one that's really famous. Here. Okay? Here, here. Okay. Yeah! So... It's...
