Son of a bitch! KILLERS OF THE WEST Damn… You almost broke my hand. I come from José Gomez. You understand? José Gomez! Who are you? What do you want? José told me to come here. He needs your help. José is in prison. He still has a year left. No, he's not there anymore. He escaped A week ago. He escaped? And where is he? He came here to see you, but the feds took him back. Was he coming to see me? Tomorrow he will be transferred to Yuma Federal Prison. Yuma.…. They sentenced him to death? If he enters there, he will not be able to escape. Nobody escapes from Yuma. José told me that his life depended on you. On me? What do you mean? He told me that you would definitely help him. Yes. What should I do? The stagecoach, which will transport him tomorrow, Must stop at Paso de la Montaña. Hey, no! Don't light it! Leave the lamp. Why? Have you been followed? A man followed me all the way. But don't worry. I'm going to get rid of it. - Hello. - Hello. I'm looking for a place to eat. It's the only place in these mountains. And you're just in time. - Sit down. - Thank you. Say… Who's this man outside? It's Miguel Cortinez. Why? He reminds me of someone I knew in Tucson. Miguel is our groom. He takes care of the stables. You must not have many customers in such a deserted place. In this part of the border, we supply the miners. And they are many. I didn't know we had company. Hello. You are very early. The scent of coffee woke me up. So sit down, I’m using one. My name is Gage Novak. This is my place. Welcome to New Charcos. - Novak? - Yes, Novak. - What is it? - I know that name. When I was little, in Texas, I remember a Novak. He was a sheriff, a federal agent, and the best shooter I have ever known. Novak is a common name in the West. My niece. The best cook in the world. Hey you. Did you leave this horse all night with his saddle? No, I just arrived. I can't bear to treat such a good horse like this. But if it's not you... A man arrived overnight. I gave him the room on the first floor. What's his name? I didn't ask him. Why? Simple curiosity. Are you the Sheriff? No. - Federal agent? - No. Where are you going? Where are you going? Hey, I'm talking to you! No one enters our rooms. Why don't you answer me? Shut up. Dirty gringo! Show yourself, coward! Come here. We are both leaving. Go to the stable. Ride a horse. Why? Do you want to shoot me in the back? No. Why would I do this? Who are you? Luke Chilson. A guy who kills for money. You are going to kill him here in front of us, Or further along the way? For the moment, it's not necessary. But I must warn you That this man is a murderer. He killed a guard at Bisbee. A poor cripple. You will take the reward money. Of course. As you take it for my meal. Hey, Phil! Can't you see anything? No, I don't see anything. If your gang tries to attack us, I'm putting a bullet between your eyes. We should soon join the stage. - Hi, Garby. - Hi, Bill. - Why so much artillery? - We're going to Yuma, for José Gomez. - Is that so… -You have people? Just a woman, she stopped to eat. You can go down. - Who is this woman? - I don't know. You, stay away from the stagecoach. Don't be afraid, madam, I'm a federal agent. - What's going on? - We are taking a prisoner. You're from around here? No, I'm visiting. I'm going to the mines. My husband is an engineer there. Carry on with your meal. No one will bother you. - Come down. - Come on. You're not taking my handcuffs off? The only thing you have to do is shut up. There is a lady in there. Women... I never scare them. It's not like Max here. Shut your mouth. Or it's the last time you open it. Hello miss. Go on sit down. Can't you take his handcuffs off? Eat. Go on, I'll pick it up. Leave it, I'll get it. - Here's a clean fork. - Thanks, I'm done. I have to go. Goodbye. Goodbye. Max, what are you doing? Do you want to let me starve? I'm outside. On the hill. Two men on horseback. Go see. Dave, one is Zacarias. The other is surely the deserter. I'll take care of Zacarias, you take care of the other. Stop! Don't come any further. Stop, I said! What's the matter? We just want water. Go on, be on your way! Damn bastards! They've been scared. Señor. We're not armed to defend orselves. - There he is! - Where's Valdez? I don't know. We haven't seen him. We have to go together, they want to hang Ruby too, at the same time as Dog. Say it louder while you're at it! Who could hear me? Can't you see them? You are so stupid. Take those damn handcuffs off me. The one outside has the keys. - What did you do now? - I am not an idiot. You understand? I'm not an idiot. $200 reward for Way Dancy, And $350 for Juan Valdez. -Do you have something to tell me? - No, Luke. Just that the guard that Valdez killed was a friend, And I'm glad you caught his killer. You are the first to tell me that. $550 on my account. Mr. Chilson, your business is more successful than funeral directors. With this deposit, your account is $7,000. It's difficult to get to 10,000. It's what we say. Chilson, I have news. José escaped and rescued Doc and Alyson. I'm going looking for them. Are you joining us? I have a lot to do, Sheriff. Sheriff, they'll give you $3000 for José. Chilson, a woman helped José. The dying coachman told us so. A woman? It was the only way to get to José. A young, rather pretty woman with blue eyes. Do you have any idea who it could be? No idea, Sheriff. See you soon. - What's up, Novak? - Hi. There is no one here worth half a dollar. I'm sure. Otherwise, you wouldn't have a revolver. I don't have a gun, Chilson. I am A peaceful trader. Gage Novak, the famous Kansas City sheriff... A peaceful trader? You don't agree? What happened to you, Novak? What will happen to you too, if you live long enough. One day you will wonder How the demons haven't killed you yet. Where did your niece go? Here you will not find anything that might interest you. I want to rent a room. Do you plan to stay here? You are not very friendly. You have no friends here Chilson. Who knows? - I'm looking for José Gomez. - José Gomez? - Didn't you tell me... - Puh! What is it, Joe? I wasn't sure of it. I would have preferred to be wrong. Wrong? What about? Oh you and Gomez. Gomez? Would he have run away? A woman helped him to escape. Why did you come here? He hopes that José will come. There must be a reward for his capture. That's right. And I warn you that it will be dangerous. We all know José. He was the son of a farmer. When this was Mexican land then bandits killed his family and stole their land when he was only a child... He often came here to play with Eden. We have known him since he was a child. This child is now a criminal. The leader of a gang of murderers, like the James or the Daltons. The James brothers and the Daltons .. Weren't as bad as they say. That is true. They had good protection alright and they were decent folk I'm warning you all. If my hunch is right, the whole gang will land here. They could arrive tomorrow, or maybe today. Better be ready. I'm only one man... You can leave now. We don't need your protection. Those who are afraid of José are the rich, Not the poor like us. You were a sheriff, weren't you, Novak? If you want my help, you may die before you get it. Enjoy your meal. C'mon, let him eat. José! José! Any problem, miss? You hollered very loud. I am glad to know that it was not against me. - Can you put me up here? - Yes. Thank you. Good evening. Turn around. - Who are you? - Martin Helzner, why? - What are you doing here? - I'm looking for a job. I just spent two weeks on horseback. It won't hurt to sleep in a good bed, And eat hot food. What is it? I have enough to pay. - Do you have your identity papers? - Why? If you have them, give them to me. I have a letter from my former boss. Okay with you? Excuse me. I thought you were someone else. And you, who are you? The local sheriff? Something like that. If you are hungry, the lady makes fine food. I would like try it, miss. Sit down. I'll prepare something for you. I told you not to come near me. Leave me alone. I just want some coffee. You have it now, so go. You know they could have killed you outside. - And your friends... - Leave me alone. - Is this man bothering you? - Yes he is. Leave her alone, friend. Boy, you better stay out of this. And you, listen to me carefully. When José Gomez and his men go... I'll be going, but you're coming with me. Dirty bastard! Stop it, this is Luke Chilson. The Bounty Killer. I don't care. I never back down from a fight This time, you're going to. I have no fight with you. A drink wouldn't hurt me. There's something funny going on around here? Here? Do you see something funny? Good night. You're wasting your time. José will not come while you're there. He's too smart for that. When will he be there? At dawn? At dawn... He will have already crossed the border. He will come here first. Why would he do that? So that you can take him back? That's what I would do. If a girl like you was interested in me. Mr. Chilson…. Do you not think that a man has the right to a second chance? Yes sometimes. If he has some good left in him. Wait. José is not guilty of what he is accused of. Listen to me, please. When he was 15 he found himself an orphan, without a penny, he didn't want to go to Mexico. He tried to start a new life in San Anton. But one day, a drunk Yankee soldier insulted him. Telling him he had to go home. I heard about it. -He killed the soldier. - It was not fair. The witnesses favored the soldier and José had to flee. And since then, he has stolen and murdered. Me is the biggest menace on the border. The José you once knew no longer exists. Don't you want to give him a chance? Let him go, Mexico City is an hour from here. When you gave him the gun at the inn, I'm sure you didn't know who you helped. I'm ready to do it again. You are unable to help anyone. You only think about money. Everyone is interested in money. But I don't like those who take what's not theirs. Do you know what happened yesterday at the stage stop? I know well what happened. He scared them and they let him escape. Let him escape? There was 7 men. 5 gurads, the driver and the owner of the hostel. I know, I saw them. You'll never see them again. Because they're all dead. - Dead? - Yes, everyone. Murdered. With your revolver. José, don't go near the village. Luke Chilson is waiting for you. You hear? He's there for you! Yes, I was told he was looking for me. He wants to kill you. We'll see. Thank you for telling me. Don't go to the village, go away. It's not good to leave without greeting your friends. C'mon. Lets' go. Are you looking for Chilson? José! He killed them both! José! Put the gun down gently, José. - Mr. Chilson - José What is it, Eden? Stay away from him, miss. If I don't obey, what are you going to do? - Will you kill me? - No. I'll kill him. Remember that my skin is worth $3000. Hey, José. You didn't take long to get caught. - Well seen, Mr. Novak. - Stand aside, miss. - Where are you taking me? - To Bisbee. And alive, if you'll let me. Miguel. How is our American family treating you? - José... - Stand aside Cortinez. This gentleman doesn't want me to have friends. He's a bounty killer. The best of them. Please. - Mister Harmon! - Hello boy. José, it's a joy to see you again. I would have liked to stay a bit, but, you see, I now have a new friend. He is not our friend, José. No one seems to like you around here. Let’s go. Are you the famous José Gomez? - Have you heard of me? - Who's not talking about you? - Leave your revolver, Helzmer. - Why? You're not going to use it, are you? - No. - Then put it down. You have no right to say what I should do. Give it to Novak. You don't mind keeping it, do you? No, it doesn't bother me. You can give it back to him when we are gone. Also take José's. Let’s go. José! Nobody can say José kills for pleasure. Nobody. Miguel, take him. A cigar, José? Thanks. Thanks for the pants, they look good on me. Before leaving, I might need... Ammunition, some food, and some whiskey. Anything you want, José. Don't you mind if I pay later? Of course not. - No - Don't worry, as soon as I get to Mexico I'll rob a bank and send you the money. I'm kidding. Are they your friends? Looks like. José, go quickly to Mexico. You got it. But I have to wait for other friends. - Why don't you go alone? - Why would I do that? Hi, boss. Hi, Zacarias. Where is your brother? He will come with the Americans. Who hit you in the eye? - Luke Chilson. - Luke Chilson? Where is he? In the stable. Gil... You shouldn't have left him alive. He's not as bad as he looks, Zacarias. No, not that!... Go! Damn you ! I'm going to kill this son of a bitch! Look, Zacarias... Everyone here Is convinced that Chilson Is a dirty killer who makes a living by killing men. As for me, they appreciate me a lot. Our interest is that they continue to think so. Come on, I'll tell you something. When I tell you, I promise you, It will be yours. Those men with José scare me. Fear not. They have nothing against us. Miguel is right. They will leave soon without hurting anyone. In any case, not us. What do they plan to do with Chilson? We shouldn't have allowed it to go this far. We said it wasn't our business. Let's go back to the store, Ruth. Miss Eden. I'm leaving and I wanted to thank you for everything. Thank you for your visit. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, friend. See you fellas. Goodbye, Mr. Gomez. Bye. Go ahead. Senor Gomez... You're not going anywhere, mister. - Who says that? - Me. Boy… Helzner. Don't try it. Senor Helzner… Mr. Chilson is right. Why leave us? You don't like it here? I'm sorry, Mr. Gomez, but I have to go. José doesn't want us to go tell the sheriff where we are. You are wrong about me. I too was in trouble, and I don't want to see the sheriff. You are surely a good guy... But I prefer that you stay here. Finally, if it doesn't bother anyone. No, Zacarias? Mr. Gomez, nobody tells me where I should go. Nor how. Helzmer. Come on, boy... Calm down. I am sorry. José, you could have avoided that. I tried to but he wouldn't listen. He was going for his gun. The third death since you've been here, José. Since I have been here…. Or since Chilson arrived? We could free Chilson. What do you think? Then, they would kill each other. Joe, look. José Gomez is here? Yes. Careful. A patrol may have arrived before us. And this good family could serve as bait. With a dead man, and everything. José Gomez! Deserter! Where were you hiding? Hey Doc! You're not having fun? Hey, watch out! You know this is for Zacarias. Three posses are looking for us. What are we waiting for? Why not go to Mexico? Doc is right. The group that followed us did not lose our trail until last night. You mean Doc wants to go to Mexico without a penny in his pocket. Don't you know that after the border, An American without money is worth less than a mangy dog? It's the truth. And Mexican women are expensive. As far as I know, there is no bank in New Charcos. How about… $5,000? In this town? There's a store, full of provisions And there must be another wagon coming. Is the old man okay? José, we have worked all our lives to run this store. It's all we got. Don't worry, Mr. Harmon. We will sell everything in Mexico and send you the money. Hey guys come here! How would you like to help Mr. Harmon get everything out? He's a good American citizen. Good idea. No, leave this box! Don't let them do it Jose! Do something… Let them go. Let them all go! - Bring another bottle. - You, serve the boss. You heard? Thank you. I hope the next load will bring better whiskey than this piss. Hold on! This pig hit my brother Antonio. It hit my brother. Take him out. Now it' my turn! You like sand! Leave him, see if he gets up! José. Why don't you leave them alone? Doesn't it make a difference that you owe us everything? I always pay what I owe. I helped you. Leave them alone. How you have changed. I'm still the same Mexican. But now I'm worth a little more. $3,000. Prepare your business, tomorrow you come with us to Mexico. How much to help us? How much are you worth? Careful. You! What are you doing here? Guys, get up! He escaped! Chilson has escaped! Who let him go? You waited too long to kill him, José. You should have let me do it. He'll find a posse and come back here. Where are you going? You are not waiting for the wagon? I don't want to be here when he returns. What are you waiting for? Go on! I knew Chilson would make it. I was the one who let him go. But he fled, leaving us alone with these murderers. Don't blame him, Harmon, he owes us nothing. He came here to uphold the law. He knew we were helpless. - He had the obligation to… - Obligation? Remember when he arrived, no one here wanted him. Luke Chilson will be back. Not for us. But there is a reason. The $3,000 for José. Dead or alive. Turn it over. Stop! There, gently. Mr. Chilson, what are you doing around here without a horse? What happened to you? Come down, I have to hurry. José Gomez and his men are in New Charcos. José Gomez? I do not like it. I am leaving. And now. I don't want to come across this damn José Gomez. What is he looking for in New Charcos? Whatever. Lend me this and that. Thank you. But... What are you going to do? Ah... The hat too. Thank you. Who let Chilson go? I don't know. And if I knew, I wouldn't tell you. You still haven't found out? José, the wagon is coming. And you? We don't know José. We know nothing. Was you Eden? Yes it was. Miss Eden.. let Senor Chilson go. Maybe she is in love with him? Where is he? Where is he?! I don't know! You hear? Get down from there! Zacarias, on the other side! Where is he? Go look inside! Go there. And you, on the other side. Chilson, show yourself! Antonio… That damned old man! kill him! Don't move. Give me that gun. No, José. You'll kill no more with my help. Aren't you going to help me? José! Leave her alone. I want to take you alive, boy. If you'll let me.
