In the age of darkness, there was chaos. It was a time when honest men ran in fear from the armies. And beautiful women, were toys to be fought over... and tossed away. My baby! Good men lost their lives defending family and honor. Weak men lived, or died, at the mercy of cruel overlords. In the midst of this chaos, there were men, heroes... who fought against evil and injustice. This is the story of one such man. A great warrior that feared nothing. He helped me, like many others, to fulfill my destiny. It was he who destroyed the evil sorcerer Munkar, recovered the Sword of Justice, and reunited the three powers. He was the man I came to know... as Deathstalker. Taking a big chance charging at a man with a drawn longbow. Must've heard about my reputation for fair play. Don't believe everything you hear. And people say cats are graceful. - You were with those wagons? - Are they... - They were taking me home. - I'll take you home. There's supposed to be a village around here someplace. I think I'll stop and ask those men. That's the village where I live. - Do you know someone there? - Yes, an old friend named Aldilar. He's got my sword. - Liala, my child! - Father! I'm afraid I can't offer you much for my daughter's return. I'm looking for a warrior named Aldilar, perhaps you know him. Several weeks ago I had the pleasure of his company in battle. Deathstalker told of a village under siege by an unknown army. He spoke of the brave and valiant Aldilar. And how together they fought off the attacking force. Finally, he recounted how they became separated, as the battle concluded. Things got a little confusing. He wound up with my sword, and I with his. - You know where I might find him? - Far away, I'm afraid. Terinda also warned Deathstalker of Kana's evil army. It was Kana's soldiers that assaulted village after village. They sacked the town, ravaged the women, and killed all the weak and helpless. By Kana's orders, they captured the strongest warriors, and took them away. No one knew why. 47, 48, 49... - Does he know someone's stolen his girl? - 50. Don't you know better than to break-in when a man's practicing? I never knew a man needed to practice that before. He's training, my friend. This is Vaniat, the great warrior. - You must work up quite an appetite. - I mean to win a tournament. Then quit standing there. Once around, come on. You know, I could make a fighter out of you. Him? He wouldn't last five minutes eating like that. And I bet you chase women too. Best exercise I know. It saps your vital juices. - Come on! - I'm an athlete, not a barbarian. If he fights like that on what he eats... don't give him any more advice. Your friend fought bravely. My sister. We were on our way to the castle. She had meant to fight in the tournament there. Now, I will fight in her place. It's very dangerous women traveling alone. You're welcome to ride with me to the castle, if you like. Will you help me bury her first? You'll never get out of here! Great. - Deathstalker... - I haven't noticed you before. you old bragabrash. Look, about that pirate ship. I've got your gold-- You're not drunk. Well, let me show you around. Don't worry, I'll take good care of you. I'm looking for Aldilar, have you seen him? I saw him last night at the banquet. Boy could he hold the wine. Probably still sleeping it off. - So why did you come here? - To fight, to win. - To win what? - Whatever the prizes are. People get bloody and die, and you want to fight, and you don't know what the prizes are? Here he is. Here's my man. - Come on, come on. - What! I just bet my horse that you can beat some worthless friend of theirs. Now is your turn. I am Kana, and I welcome you to my domain. Some of you Iâ€™ve met before, and I am pleased that you've accepted my invitations. Others of you, I'm seeing for the first time. I look forward to knowing you better. - To Kana! - Kana! - Kana! - Kana! To Kana! If your heart is set on fighting in this tournament, I need to teach you a few things about your sword. Well, that's not exactly what I planned on learning about tonight. What exactly did you have in mind? What would it take, to civilize you? I've seen how civilized people live. Who is it? Do you have a woman there? I have one already, thank you. Then she has to come with me. What for? The Lady Kana has ordered all the woman warriors to the great hall. At this hour? Lots are to be chosen to determine opponents for the tournament. I'll be here when you get back. - They get you out of bed too? - Almost. Warm hands... Warm heart too? - I was keeping it warm for someone else. - She'll be busy for a while. I don't know how much longer I can drag this out. What did you come here for? You... Your power. That's what I came here for. I can show you how to use it. I think I'll manage just fine. Do not tell me what to do! Somebody should. I need a man, the bigger the better, and drunk! You had a visitor? You can't very well say no to the lady that owns the castle. - What did she want? - I don't know exactly. I met a girl downstairs. I think I'll go see if I can spend the night in her room. You're worried about more than who's been in my bed. If this is just some tournament, why are they watching every move we make? Why are there guards patrolling the halls? There are doors sealed off. Bars on the windows. I don't think it's just a tournament either. This sword belonged to a friend, and he's got mine, but he's disappeared. And so has my sword. If its magic falls into the wrong hands... What then? Kana came here for something, but it wasn't my body. You need a little help? She's not public property. I didn't have anything public in mind. Don't risk your neck. Stop hurting her please, your going to kill her! You're mine now. Any arguments? You remember that fellow I was betting with yesterday? You've seen him? Nor Aldilar either. I shall choose the first pair. Endoron and Tiodon. Endoron, no sword? My head wouldn't stand the clanging. And so the tournament began. Very few warriors had the privilege of fighting in Kana's private courtyard. Most challengers faced off by the outer castle walls for the entertainment of the local peasants. Janeris... and Zeliana. I want to see that one fight. Well, you by some coincidence, you should happen to draw number 16. Concentrate, harder! Lady Kana wishes to favor you with a special gift. No, no, that's not the weapon you'll be needing, my friend. I saw them come up here. Where could they have... If you were remotely attractive, I'd let you live. And here's my little trophy. That didn't have to be a fight to the death. Every fight is to the death. You lose your life, you lose your honor, They're both the same thing. You can always win your honor back. Spoken like a woman who's never lost hers. She's taken three more warriors. Take us in the finals. Deathstalker. Deathstalker and Baksilon. That one? He won't fight his way out of a burlap bag. Disqualify him. Ladies and gentlemen, due to an error in his statement of application to this tournament. We must temporarily disqualify Baksilon. His place, will be taken, by Vaniat! You saw him kill all those men in the woods, he fights like a demon. Against riffraff pillaging the countryside. His kind never stand up to a real fighting man. Here's your favorite sword. I don't know if I mentioned this, but I've never lost a tournament. Not once... not ever... not today. Anytime your ready. Foot work, foot work! I've had tougher fights than this with roast beef. Here, here. You're better off harvesting corn with that thing. It's you who'll be getting harvested. Get moving! A hogs head of milk every day. Get up! Get up! I don't really want to kill you. I don't really want to die. We have a stronger opponent for him tomorrow. Vaniak and Steroks! I told you the wine would do our work for us. Have him taken to the dungeon with the others. Come on, we got a nice place where you can rest. The next one, quickly! I'll switch to spy tube number four. He's moving toward tube number six. I hate these castles. It's not easy being a hero. - Who's there? - Lesia. - I'm very sick. - Did you eat something? I've been drinking. There isn't much to do when you don't know anyone. You just need to sleep it off. Come on. Oh, if I go to sleep, I'm not going to wake up. The wine in this place flows like a waterfall. I'm surprised more people aren't passing out. Someone holding a tournament would want the warriors to be at their best, wouldn't they? I'm not so sure. Why is Kana so eager to keep everyone drinking? She's not just drunk, what if the wine is poisoned? Kana drank it herself, I saw her. It's her wine, she'd know how to protect herself. Think about it, who's here? Every warrior for 200 miles around who might stand against her. So the tournament is just to keep us busy while she picks us off one at a time. I need someone who can get close to Kana. Someone who doesn't drink. Pick up my sword, lay down my life, yes. But this is something-- She's got every warrior in the castle to choose from. How's she ever going to fall for a man who has never touched a woman - in his life? - Because it's a man's instinct to hunt, to fight, to laugh, to ravage women. Oh boy. - Well it, doesn't look that unpleasant. - Good... Now, you must think about what makes a woman happy. - Oh, we know what that is. - If a woman wants to sit... you hold her chair. If she desires wine, you reach first. - Hand her the wine. - I won't have to drink, will I? No, just pretend to. - But be careful. - It's got a poison in it. - Oh, great. - Vaniak... You must watch Kana to see what she takes to save herself. We must find the antidote. You must always pay attention to a woman. Tell her that she looks beautiful. Go ahead, try it. You look very beautiful. You sound like your talking about a leg of mutton. I've never touched mutton. - But this is a woman! - I know, and... This is the closest I've ever been to one. You look... very... - good. - Fine, very good. You're so big, and strong, and handsome. That's good. Good. That's good, save it for Kana. Vaniak, I want you to understand something. You're a very attractive man. And, you're not pleading with Kana to take you. You're giving her the good fortune, - of being your choice. - Oh... sure... yeah. After all, I... I am a great athlete, and... I am pretty good looking. She'll never know what hit her. Sex? Sex? You're not going to sleep with that woman! It'll take four days for your vital fluids to build up again. In four days, this tournament will be over, and somebody else would be living, in the castle you should have won! Deathstalker. The alive-est dead man I've ever seen. Maybe you've got some answers. - At the end of my sword. - I wouldn't count on it. Try again? How did he get like that? Lady Kana's magic or her wine? - I don't know how she does it to them. - There's more of them? - Where? - I don't know, I don't. I had to kill a guard, so she's onto us. Next. Let's see now. Ziandra and Dionara. Why did we have to let these peasant girls in it? Do you like peasant girls? My lady, what peasant girl could compare with your royal beauty? We are wasting your potion and my magic on them. - Why don't we just-- - We need time for the potion to work. Oh, is this what you wanted? Why didn't you just ask? Unh-uh, say please. Get up! Get on your feet! - I didn't expect you to fight like that. - Neither did I. The great woman warrior. But the tournament goes on, and before it ends, you're gonna have to face me. - Dionara. - You seem to be having a good time. - You can take her. - I know I can. - I like you. - I am lucky. You know you're not just muscles, like other men around here. There's something different about you. You're right about that. Wine? The finest wine I've ever tasted. You must show me your cellar. I'll show you more than that. This is all your fault, you know? Look at him. Drinking, eating fattening foods, chasing women! Get your hands off her. - I can defend myself, thank you. - So I see. I don't like you. You what? Let's see how you like it. Chicken, my lady? Tomorrow is the last day of the tournament, and whatever Kana has planned, she's got to do it by then. There's only one place she could be keeping them where no one would notice. How do you know? I've been here before. This was my family's castle. Finally, I told my story. How my parents, my sister, and I, watched helplessly as our peaceful domain was attacked and overrun by the soldiers of Kana's father. My sister and I were imprisoned, until a servant helped us to escape. My mother and father... were murdered. I've come back here to reclaim my birthright. So you're a princess? I should have known. I'm always getting mixed up with princesses. I liked you even when you were a peasant girl. This way. The happy couple out for their evening stroll. - Shall I prepare a welcome for them? - Yes. I want him alive. - And her? - She means nothing. - Do with her what you will. - I'm sure I can think of something. Oh, I love them when they're helpless. We used to hide down here. They'd search for us all day. Drink. You're fair to weakness, like the others. You're gonna make love to me before this night is over like you've never made love before. I'll give you more strength than you ever could have imagined. Sooner or later, one of you had to be difficult. That's far enough, It's best I do this alone. - I've got more reason than you to be here. - And more reason to stay alive. Please, just go back to the room now. What's this? It protects me. You seem to do pretty well with a sword in your hand. I wouldn't've without it. Its magic stays with me, and I stay with you. Another one turned to stone. Your order is being carried out, my lady. I've been pouring wine into him all night and he's finally starting to go under. Some of them have stronger constitutions than others. What? Here? Switch to spy tube number six. If he gets out of that room, it's your head! Guards! Shut the door. You live in a barn? Aldilar... she's turned you to stone. And you'll be next. He doesn't have your sword, we have it. - And we want the secret of its magic. - The secret is... there is no secret. Deathstalker, I have no time for such games. - Then draw your sword. - I don't have one. I don't need one. Caught between a rock and a hard place. Thank you stone head. Sleep on, you muscle-bound pig. That's all you're good for. Muscle-bound pig, am I? Pig... she called me a pig. Muscle-bound... and I was nice to her. I don't suppose either of you would be kind enough to scratch my nose? Your throat will be scratching soon enough. You may go now. I said go. You didn't have to go to all this trouble, A simple invitation. I'm pleased you had a chance to meet my previous conquests. You're next. Look, Kana, I can be so much more fun to you alive than dead. If you just untie these straps. Are you saying you want to make love to me? You are a very beautiful woman. I bet you say that to all the wicked princesses. What kind of man do you take me for? - I'm going to find out. - Good. Why don't you untie me and lets go to your chambers. A little toast first. No toast, just a little coffee. Are you saying you refuse to drink to me? Listen, if you intend to kill me, do it now. I'd rather not drink your poison. I don't intend to kill you at all. You've seen the soldiers of my new army, The wine and the magic. The wine makes them strong in body, and weak in heart, and the magic makes them mine. And before tomorrow is out, there'll be more of them. Many more. An invincible army. Kill you? I have no intention of killing you, my love. You will be doing the killing. You'll do anything I want you to. Once your will has turned to stone. - They've got him. - Yes I know. - I have the cure for the poison. - You do? - That can't be all it will take. - I got more. I cleaned her out. You can't be dead. This will help you. It's the antidote. Here. Here, take this. - Is Deathstalker Alright? - Yes. Protect you from Kana. I greet you on the final day of the tournament. To have fought here at all, is an achievement, and so there are no losers. - And no winners. - Except me. The contest for the first prize, is between Jenaris and Dionara. You okay? I remember when I chose you. And you. And you. And wherever Deathstalker has gone, you will find him. Some of you have waited long. Now your time has come. In moments I will cast a spell, and many more will join you. Those who don't... you will kill. I just wanna make sure you don't come out of this quite so pretty. Aldilar, come on. I've got to get you out of here. Aldilar, look at me. This is Deathstalker, your friend. Look at me! Aldilar... you must... take... the antidote. Look at me! This tournament is not over! The warriors, all of you, will gather in the center of the arena! Now, to make your power complete. To the attack! - Deathstalker. - Aldilar? A fight? Which side am I on? I waited a long time for this. Deathstalker. - Why aren't they all mine? - I think use a little more. Wrong! - The test! - So much for your magic. Get out there, give it time. Nothings going to stop them, until I stop Kana. This castle needs a new princess. Because there are so many of them. The mixture needed to be stronger! You failed me! I didn't! I never would. - You are no match for her power. - But more than a match for yours. I've killed far greater men than you in my time. Your time's up. Now my power is back. You'll be mine, still. You're beautiful, your charming, you're certainly a pleasure to be with, but... - you're just not my type. - To us. You think your puny magic is a match for mine? You're mine, Deathstalker. You, and all the others outside. I'll turn them all to stone, and that young wench of yours. But you... You I will keep alive to torture forever. Because you see, now I have the strength to live forever. After the wine you just drank, you may live forever... as a statue. My potion is stronger than the wine. We've got your potion. My power is not gone yet! So you want to play with fire? Alright. No! The spell's broken. They're coming back to life!
