[SINISTER MUSIC] All right! Let's get it into gear. What have we got here? "The pale moon hung in the night sky like a silvery coin. By this light Veronica looked at him, her loins shaking..." "Shaking" no, that's not right. How about "shimmering?" Maybe "quaking?" How about "quivering?" Quivering in anticipation as young Vincent fumbled with his trousers. The sweat trickled down between her breasts as she eagerly awaited in anticipation of young Vincent's... Ah... What's another word for penis? [TYPING] Uh, this is bullshit. [COMPUTER SPARKING] Wait! You lil' shit, I still have six more payments to make on you. [DOG BARKING] What the hell? Hey, hey hey! It's... It's cousin, Gary. How've you been, man? Who are you? Do I know you? It's me... It's Ozzy. It's your cousin, man. Well, it's your second cousin. Who gives a shit, right man? I mean Blood's blood, am I right? All right... All right, remember, when you and I were like kids. And uh... I had this... this dead fly collection and uh, and I accidentally ate the whole box. And then I got really sick and I like barfed calling mom, that was me, man. Oh, yeah! You. So, uh... What brings you to the Ridgeway at... three in the morning? You're gonna get this, man. Sorry. Check this out. All right, you know how's my dad it's like three hundred pound red neck, potato farmer, right, and everything. I told him how me and the guys are gonna make it like really big with the band and everything, you know. But he kept coming at me which this job shit. I mean, what an ass-wipe. Am I right? See, this is what I told. I went up to him and I said, "That's it! You fat bastard. I'm out of here." And I just kept on rocking in the free world. Man you know, how cool you are, Gary? That's why I look you up first thing. Also, if you can let me crash here in your love shack, man. Wait a minute, I don't think... Man, this is a really cool place. You know, if I ever... ever made any money in my life I would like to get a place just like this one. Man, I don't care what anybody else in the family says about you, I love you, man, I love you, man. So where do I stash my stuff? Your "stuff?" Yeah, where do you want me to stash it, man? I mean, I can leave it sittin' here though, for ain't no biggie to me man. Ah, you mind if I smoke pot in the house? "Pot!" Wait a minute. Oh, I can share it with you, man, that's cool. Wait a minute, I don't think I invited you to stay here. You see, I like living here by myself. And that I can make a bed like right here. Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god! We can stereo set up, man. I guess you can put your stuff in the closet back there. Damn! [MUSIC PLAYING] Uh... yeah Joe, whatever. Hey, is this... is this a wicked freaking tool man, huh? Great! Really great. Have a blast. I'll be out in the kitchen swinging from the news if you need me. Okay? [BLUESY MUSIC] MAN ON TV: Ladies and gentleman, It's live with Gerald Rivers. That's right, you are tuned to the only place on television that dares to explore what no other talk show can. All this week we are featuring a special panel of educated guests, Doctor Carl Hooper, child psychologist, Anton Hershberger, and professor of sociology at Penn state university Ken Joyner. Hello again everyone and welcome back. It's controversial, it's in all the newspapers. It's everywhere you turned these days. USA today just released their findings of a recent study. Seems the number of people dying in their sleep in this country alone, has risen over 200 percent in the last four months. Some people are calling it an epidemic others are calling it an outright phenomenon. Doctor Hooper, Carl, what is it? Yes, well, Gerald, I'll tell you I've studied this thing very, very carefully. What we may be experiencing here is... something very similar to an adult version of crib death. "Crib death!", Jesus, Carl, where the hell do you ever get a masters' degree in physics, from a crack a joke box? It's so un-scientific, it makes me sick. I mean, where'd you ever scrap up a ridiculous theory like that anyway, the late show? Get a real job, huh. DOCTOR HOOPER: What's wrong with crib death? It's rationally enough. Excuse me, Dr. Hooper, but I really can't picture grown men and women being suffocated in their sleep by their own blanket. Who said blanket? I never said blanket. Well, I think you are all a bunch of freaking loonies. Then I suppose you have a better idea. As a matter of fact, I do. As you know, the excessive use of fluorocarbons and the destruction of the rain forests have opened up a huge hole in the Ozone layer, this has led the people being bombarded by potentially deadly solar radiations, mixed in the industrial waste. The carcinogens from second hand smoke, the radon pockets underground. What you have is a virtual domino effect of evil here. Most of these sleeping victims have been diagnosed with brain embolisms, heart attacks, strokes. I tried to find relationship between those two elements. It sounds like Earth day propaganda to me. Woodsy Owl says, "Give a hoot, don't pollute or you'll die in your sleep tonight." Am I right? Now see, Anton, I am bigger than you. I can kick your fat ass out... Gentlemen! Gentlemen. We're all adults here remember. Blow it out your narrow little ass, Gerald. I hate this show and I think you suck. [JOYNER GRUNTING] Obliquely feisty subject on this week's Live With Gerald Rivers, and we'll be right back. Crackpots! Are you all right, Maris? My hero. Well, I try to be. Why don't you sit down or something? I am fine, sweetheart. Would you like a urine sample? Very cute, so when are they gonna let you go for the day? I am about to be fired. Do you see this mess? Hey, Maris, god dammit. I wanna see a broom in your hands, I wanna see that dishes cleaned up, pronto! I'll go. Wait for me outside, okay. So uh, what was that scene back there? Well, you know how Merle is, Gary? He is pushy. That's not what I am talking about, Maris. Why? You mean the stuff with the plates? I drop plates all the time. It's no big deal. Well, you look like you were going to faint or something. I wasn't going to faint. Don't be so melodramatic. What was it then? I don't know, okay. There you satisfied? If I thought it to be something serious I'd be worried about it. Next subject. Okay. Uh, your parents still out of town? Yup, they are in Tempe, Arizona, till the end of the winter. Is that why you weren't sleeping? I'm sleeping just fine, Gary. Do me a favor and stop worrying about it, okay? I am a big girl. I happen to care about you, Maris, a lot, you know. Why don't you save this tough act for your folks or something. This could be something serious. Fine, you wanna talk about sleeping problems, Gary, let's talk about your insomnia. It's not insomnia. I'm just having a little trouble with this new book, that's all. When I am done I'll be fine. Anyway, I am not the one falling asleep on my feet, you are. Yeah, well, I am sure you didn't get sleep last night or the night before that or the night before that. Why do you keep beating yourself like that, Gary? Those books you are writing just aren't taking you anywhere. They are just torturing you and me with you. Okay, everything that's wrong here because of my writing career. Is that what you want to hear, Maris? Well, if you're waiting on the fame and the fortune to come and make me a millionaire tomorrow, you can keep on waiting. Whatever gonna happen with my stuff is gonna to take time and you knew that, getting into this. I have given you all the time in the world to go out and chase this fantasy of your's, Gary. But I'm almost out of college. It's time to think about the future. Our future. Maybe we should just let it go. What, so I can become a busboy at the Newport cafe? Be a banker, no, I could deliver pizzas. I like what I am doing for living, writing. You write romance novels for your living. That's not what you really want, is it? Hey, it pays the rent. Yeah, but you are not going to get anywhere with it. You're not giving me enough time. Fine then. I am sick of your career getting in the way of our relationship. You wanna live in your little fantasy world, you can go right ahead. But you have to do it by yourself. I got to go. Yoo-hoo, Maris! Maris. Hi, Mrs. Martinak. Mowing the lawn, huh? Oh, good heavens no. It's just a toy. My son, Paul, drove by today and gave it to me. He is such a good boy. Don't you just love it? I just love toys. How is, Paul? He just doesn't drive all the way out here to Ridgeway like he is to. Not after that terrible accident at the junkyard and his divorce. He just doesn't seem to be the same. It was such a bad time. Dear lord honey, what's wrong? You look so sad, so pale. I am fine really. Just another bad fight with Gary again, that's all. And I am tired a lot lately. I mean I sleep okay it just doesn't seem like I am getting any rest, you know. Sleep but no rest. Maybe you are having a lot of bad dreams then. I can't remember, doesn't seem like it though. You know what they say about bad dreams, don't you? They say bad dreams keeps the devil awake. He'll come crawling into your bedroom window while you sleep, looking for your soul then you'll have really good dreams but they'll turn real bad so you can wake up just in time to turn the lights on and chase him away. Devil cannot abide the light you know. Oh yeah, and what was suppose to happen if the bad dream doesn't wake you up? Oh, oh dear, well, it's just an old wives's tale, all right. I am sure I'm fine, Mrs. Martinak. It's just I have to get my act together, that's all. Oh, I am sure you are gonna be just fine. You are just going through some really rough times, what with living in that big old trailer all by yourself for the winter. I know, why don't you come on in let me fix you a nice hot cup of tea then I can show you all my wonderful toys. Thanks. I'd like that. Hello, stranger. Uh-oh! Hi, Zachariah, Having a cook out, huh? Cook out? [LAUGHS] You know, I don't remember to use that expression since since... the hell since 'Nam! You know, back during the Tet offensive, and you were just itching your daddy's balls back then, Gary. But we had ourselves one hell of a cook out. Let me tell you, now, one of them gooks was using one of them rat tunnels they was using to run around in and I said, "Hell with that." Undrop me a whole canister of napalm right on top of that little yellow slain eye bastard, ha. The hell, what was left of him look like... it look like one of them bare ribs Pugsley is eating over there. Mom! See what you did, man, now he won't eat. Our son's gonna waste away to skin and bones because you had to tell him one of your sick old war stories [BURPING] Oh... so they're sick old now, are they? Well, let me tell you something, woman. That boy ought to be thanking me for telling him how it really went down there in the war He sure as hell ain't going to get it from watching Platoon Or Full Metal Jacket. Don't tune into him, Gary. It'll just make things worse. He's still, you know, fighting soldiers from the sky, dig? He stays up all night these days parades around the house with that rifle of his. He's probably gonna end up blowing us all away in our sleep. I told you why dammit. You've seen him yet, Gary? Seen who? The Sandman, Gary. The Sandman. I thought I was hallucinating when I saw him back in Vietnam. Wait for me and my buddies to go sleep back there in the dark old jungle. You get in touch with death over there, Gary, That's what of it gets worse. That's how I probably got to see him in the first place. Oh Jesus, dad's tripping again. You hear that old song, "Mr. Sandman," [CHUCKLES] That's why me and my buddies call him that. You see. You won't see it. Go to sleep. You won't see it and have a nice wonderful dream. And then... He comes out of the dark to get you like some freaking vampire. Oh, I thought I had forgotten about him all this time I wanted to forget. I thought it was some old nightmare and maybe I was still having it because you see I have seen him here. You know, bet the VA hospital has got real good psychiatrist. First you go check up on that. Yeah! I am crazy. [GIBBERING] [LAUGHS] Or maybe you better be real careful. When you go to sleep tonight, huh, pal. Real... careful. Yeah, I'll watch out for him. Well, I have got to go. Got a lot of stuff to do. Still! [LAUGHS] Hell, I haven't heard anybody use that ever since since... since Hanoi. When uh... I stabbed at one of them gooks, my god damn, bayonet hell! What poured out of his body looked like... like uh... that spaghetti we had in supper last night. [IN UNISON:] Mom! Zachariah, get back over here. Oh, huh! BUD: Okay, honey want to see it move in here now. Betrayal is all about sex. Your sex okay. Yeah, that's it. Get in with the Bee. Oh, that's it, baby. Grind them hips, baby.

She's bitch as S-S. Oh, absolutely. I mean everything, like something is in the air, maybe something bad. It's like everything is fallen apart around here, you know. Jesus Christ, are you depressing, Gary. I'd certainly help you with Dr. Gevorkian's home number on your speed dialer, pal. It's just the bad vibes that's all. I think it's over between Maris and me. Maybe the end of the world too, I don't know. Well, brother, god made man, Satan made woman, that's what coming off man, woman. Women are evil. Wisdom thrown down from the mountain Mount Gary, hitch on, Brother Gary. Bud, I have to get to my job at the phone sex line in a half hour, hurry up. Be right there, sweet cheeks. Hey, Gar, I've been trying discount for the last week now, I think she is about ready to be introduced to Bud's old heat seeking moisture missile, you know what am saying. I'll talk, catch you later. [MOANING] Hey, Cousin Gary, pull up a seat, man, it's movie night. How nice, thanks for asking me first. What is that? Is that uh... Is that a porno movie? You guys are sitting around in the dark watching porno movies in my house. Oh great! Your parents will love me. It's not a porno movie, be cool man. It's like... an art movie. It's got a lot of barfing in it though. Yeah, well, it push outs too. Well, I'll just seal myself up in he kitchen for the rest of the night, okay? Great! Man, those are the fakest looking tits I have ever seen. Ah, who cares man. I'd still do her. Man, could you guys keep it down this is like a majorly plot point coming up here, thanks! Pale moon hung like a silvery coin in the night sky as Veronica... Veronica, shit! Know watch you doing Veronica? You are playing with his head. Sure, everything is going great now. But wait till Vince wants to do something like uh... writing the great American novel. Or... Or being able to pay his bills by doing something he enjoys than self slaving away in some factory. Uh-huh. And you'll smother him like a freaking pillow. Just like... Maris. [SIGHS] Bud was right, women are evil. No uh... No sleep. None at all. [GROANS SOFTLY] Bom bom bom bom bom. Bom bom bom bom. Bom bom... Bom bom bom bom... Bom bom bom... Bom bom bom... Not again. [SWOOSHING] Move it. Shit! [DOG BARKING] [HAMMERING] [DOG WHINING] [HOWLING] HERSHBERGER: Nightmares are logically very healthy defense systems. It goes back to the end of all times. When man had to keep on his toes so to speak. Deep sleeper back then would have been helpless. Helpless from what exactly? Well, I... I imagine back then it would have been from large predators. Uh... right? Also, there is some speculative data out now to support the theory that the uh... our own subconscious triggers nightmares, huh! Whenever, so we say whenever something out of the ordinary occurs uh... a burglar perhaps or perhaps may be ah... truck going by on the street. Hey! Carl, I brought you your own blanket. Hey! Are you calling me a crack pot? You got it, Doc! You know, you really look stupid with that so called blanket cramped up your... your ass sideways. Oh yeah! Give it your best shot, fat boy! [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] Stupid show. You know what your problem is, Gary? At least you know, what I think it is? No, what is it? You are a putz! A putz! That's what I said "A putz." First you let this cousin of yours, this Skuzzy... Ozzy. Whatever, come in and take over your home then you let Maris, a broad, nonetheless screw with your head. Personally, I would have kicked you out of the He-man women haters club for that one. And now I come over here and you tell me you saw some kind of monster roaming around here last night. [SIGHS] Yeah, what's your point? I think it's obvious, you are a putz! Did it really eat the dog? You're gonna stick with that story? I saw something. Maybe it wasn't a monster. Maybe it was my imagination. I don't know but I did see something. You saw that dead dog back there. What do you think could have done something like that? Well, for Christ sake, it could have been another stray dog. Granted a big stray dog but nonetheless a stray dog. It wasn't a stray dog, that much I know. This thing, whatever it was, it had these glowing red eyes. It was huge. Well, maybe you saw the devil last night. Maybe you had a date with Linda Blair. Maybe even bumped into the anti-Christ, and last night's three digit lotto number was six, six, six. Hey, what you want to hear from me, pal? Tell me I am not crazy. But you are crazy, Gary. You definitely need to get laid or something. I'm not crazy. OZZY: Okay, guys keep it down. This is like a really cool movie, okay? Rage, in the end, gets bloodthirsty camel demons from Kansas city kicks ass. GIRL: Hey man, why don't you just get the remote and skip the gore. OZZY: Man, that's stupid. MAN: Who gives a shit. I wanna see that porno flick we were watching last night again. OZZY: Tough, cool breathe. We are watching this, radical, cool flick. MAN: Is there a lot of tities in this one? OZZY: Would you shut up? This is like the most important part of the whole movie and you guys are all screwing up with your big freaking mouths. MAN: Wait a minute, you guys. Hey, is that chick gonna take her clothes off or what? ALL: Uh... ew... GIRL: This is like a stupid movie man. Like a chick's standing on a step ladder for ten minutes while the dude pulls her guts out of her crotch. [SCOFFS] Stupid. Man, I could have made a better movie than this in my backyard lawn with my own video camera. MAN: Hey, man can we like get our money back? I really feel like violated by this one, you know. Hey, Ozzy, going on my girlfriend's house, okay? [CLOCK TICKING] Go dream. Toys... Oh... my wonderful toys. [EXCLAIMS] [BABY CRYING] [SCREAMS] My God! Maris. Maris. Maris. [HORSE NEIGHING] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Maris. [SCREAMING] Gary! What the hell are you doing here? Did you see that? Did I see what, Gary? You're really starting to scare me. I saw something in here. In the same room with you, it was holding you. Nobody was holding me, Gary, I was asleep by myself. It was huge. It had these glowing red eyes. It had you off the bed. You didn't feel it holding you? Either you are pulling a hell of a good act or you've been out boozing up with Bud. Dammit, I know what I saw. Gary, you are tired. You need some rest. Go home and get some sleep. Gary, you can lay down right here, it'll be just like old times. I did see something. I'm not imagining it. Well, get some sleep. I love you. You don't love me. No, you don't love me, Gary, you don't even love yourself any more. I mean look at you, you are going crazy. I am not crazy. Maris, I came here to apologize that's what I wanted to do then I came down the hall and that's when I saw it. That thing! Right! You don't believe me? No, I don't believe you. What you think I am supposed to be impress with you if you come over here, trying to scare me with some stupid story you made up? Not impressed, sorry. I am not making it up. I need you to believe me. Okay, Gary, so you are not making it up, so... just leave, get out. Whatever game you are trying to play with me I can't play it anymore. I refuse to play it. All I ever wanted for me was you to grow up. I don't think you can, Gary. Don't think you want to. Maris, please. Goodbye, Gary. And I want my spare key back. Wake up, wake up. BOY ON TV: Jay, over here. MAN: I am saying that... that I am here to see that you get a good night's sleep. But I don't wanna go to sleep. Aww, you will. While I put you on a brand new collar X brand mattress that is. [SWITCHES CHANNEL] Yesterday, as... some of you may or may not be aware of Doctor Carl Hooper noticed physicist, philosopher and long time friend of the "Live With Gerald Rivers show" was discovered dead in his home. Yet another victim of this ongoing, inexplicable plague of sleeping deaths has currently shocked this nation. The official report released by the coroner's office states that Doctor Hooper died of a massive brain embolism. And yet... And yet many of us here feel that our esteemed colleague died within striking distance of the dream. His dream. This senseless epidemic. So, gentleman, why don't you tell arguing audience what your opinion is of this, so called sleeping death plague? Now that your adversary Doctor Hooper, is dead. Well, Gerald, at this point I would have to say that we should all rethink the implications of what exactly is going on here. These things are becoming very serious. The cycle of death isn't just going to go away, is it? So, what should we, the people at large do at this point? Honestly, I don't know. Perhaps, we should all just lay down, go to sleep and die. If people are going to be afraid to go to sleep in night, the situation has become very bad indeed. [CHATTERING OVER RADIO] Stand back off, please. Stand back. WOMAN: What happened? MAN: No idea. Get back to the curve with the others, pal. Hey, what happened? Are you a relative of hers? Just a friend of the family. Well, as far as I could help she just went into massive heart failure in her sleep. No signs of foul play, probably didn't feel a thing. Maris! [SIREN BLARING] You just let me know if you need anything else, okay? We have to talk, Maris. Gary, I'm working. Does that mean anything to you? No, of course not. We have nothing to talk about, especially here. This is important. Right, excuse me, please! Listen to me. I am through listening, Gary. I am not making anything up. I really did see something in your room last night. If that was an apology, pal, it was the hell of a bad one. I wasn't trying to apologize. Then go screw yourself. Something bad's happening around here, something really bad. Yeah, you're finally starting to lose your mind. I think what I saw in your room last night is part of it. I think you want me to go crazy with you, that's what I think. I'm not crazy. You look like you haven't slept in a month. You look crazy. Mrs. Martinak died last night. Died! Mrs. Martinak, died? They said she had a heart attack. They said she died in her sleep. I think I'm gonna be sick. They said she died in her sleep, Maris. Haven't you been watching the news? The stuff's happening all over and I think... I think whatever I saw in your room last night has got something to do with it. What are you... I can't believe this. I can't believe you are taking it this far. How can you stand there and talk like that? If you just... Just get away from me. Don't touch me. Don't even talk to me. Do you hear me? You're crazy. I am not crazy, Maris. Dammit, I'm not crazy. Am I? Gary, my friend, I think you ought to go home and get yourself some shut eye. You really look like hell. With all due respect don't come back here again, okay? You are a nice kid. I'd hate to have to call the cops on you. I am just running my business here, you understand? This is a stupid, stupid idea, Gary. If I didn't think you were one week from being carted off to freaking loony being, I would have never let you talk me into this. It's morbid, besides that it's illegal. We gonna get caught, man. We gonna be on the next episode of Cops. I am telling you we are gonna get caught. We are not gonna get caught if you shut the hell up. Damn! Great! It's locked, okay. Lets go back to my place I got a bottle of Tequila with both our names on the label. Granted your name's a little bit bigger on the label than mine, well, what are you gonna do? There's got to be another way in. Yeah, man, it's called illegal entry. Maybe you have heard of it, my friend. Besides, why are you so obsessed with getting into this place? The old prude is dead. It's a funny thing about old people, Gary. They die alive. I know it's a weirdo concept for you to handle and all and not being able to tune into the reality channel any more. She was murdered. Whoa! [SCOFFS] We whine a little bit, pal, I read it in the paper. An old madam died of a heart attack. A heart attack, Gary, in her sleep. I think something caused it to happen. Oh! Let me guess, something big with glowing red eyes it likes to eat small animals. Am I right? I don't know, that's why I want to get in there to find out. God! Listen to what's coming out of your mouth, Gary, It's crazy and so are you. I am not crazy. People are dying in their sleep all over this place. How crazy is that? Is that normal? Is that perfectly reasonable to you? Well, Gary, my friend whatever it is it certainly isn't attack of the 50 foot freaking cooty monster amazonia ninja mutant slime balls from vampire world and Walley world and all these places combined for crying out loud. How do you know? Maybe it's really good at hiding, maybe that's why nobody has ever seen him. Oh, oh, Gary, hey, did you hear that thing that was freaking reality flying out of the window. Okay, let's say for the sake of argument, there is some case running around here What you gonna do if you find it? Beat the shit out of it, call the cops, use the force, scary one? [IMITATING BUZZING] We'll find out when we. Just keep watch out here, okay? God, monsters! Jesus Christ, those beat off books really burn out the poor kid's brain cells. [LAUGHS] And they tell me, my dark room chemicals are no good for me. Oh, come on, Gary, the old one-eyed wonder lizard's gotta stake. Oh! Come on, Gary. Satan! Oh! You should not have looked for me. Bud! What shall be your demise on this... Sleep... Sleep. So I can devour you. Bud! For Christ sake, he is in here with me. Sleep. Devour you. [SCREAMING] For the Christ sake, Gary, what the hell is going on in here? Come on, man, it's getting late, let's get the hell out of here. This place gives me the heaves. Besides, I've gotta feel like a rain forest. Hello, boy. You look like one of them green privates I had in my platoon back in Vietnam. Yeah. I remember this one kid he... he couldn't be more 19 and one night he was out taking a leak in on of the latrines when this, god damn goop chucked his shrapnel grenade right through the damn latrine door. Oh... There was blood and guts and shit and piss and more blood and more piss. More shit and more guts... Oh, for Christ sake, Gary, let's get out here before I lose my lunch. Tell me more about the Sandman. Well... What do you already know, boy? I think I saw him, tonight. Uh, best we hadn't this conversation here then. Listen to me. Whatever this thing out there is, it's killing people, it tried to kill me tonight. Now if you know something about it and it's not just from your crazy horse shit, well, then you better damn well tell me. If you have already seen him it's already too late. I know, anybody ever saw the Sandman either died or went crazy. "Or went crazy," it's a lot healthier. Talk! Yeah. I've seen him before, it was during the war. At the end of our stay in the Tahoe valley that mother got every last soldier in my platoon. Except of me and Big Barny. And when I came out and my beard was white and I was crazy. When I got back to HQ I kept my mouth shut. So as the big wigs wouldn't lock me up in a rubber pokey and throw away the key. But I know what I saw. But what the hell was it? Oh! Jesus Christ, Gary, don't tell me you are actually buying colonel clink over here. I don't know what it was. But I think... I think it's been around for a long time. Almost as long as we have. That travels by night like a goon. Hell, it uses a knife to protect itself and it's smart, Gary. I could feel that. We can't live as long as this thing has, feeding all of human beings and not get real freaking smart. It did. And it knows nobody believes in it. So it's safe in this world. I believe in it. [SIGHS] It's too late for you. It waits for you to go to sleep, you know. Until you're helpless and then it makes you dream. A dream so good you never wanna wake up ever. Stay awake, Gary. Stay awake. Stay awake! Hey, Gary, this guy has guns, now let's get out of here before he breaks them up and we start looking like the enemy. He's crazy. Yeah? Maybe I am, too. Nobody ever comes over just to shoot the chatty any more. What is happening to me? Great, this is great Pete. Okay, oh yeah. [CLEARS THROAT] Hi, it's uh... it's Cousin Gary. Uh, how about that, huh? Uh, I know this kind of looks bad uh... but see it really wasn't anything like that let me just explain. I don't want to know, really. Well, see I didn't take you'd be home till like... later and stuff. So I thought you wouldn't mind. You thought I wouldn't mind? Did you ever even think to ask me if I minded or even to ask me to let your pals come over here and watch porno flicks? Or to even let you stay here? This act is getting real old, Skuzzy. Uh... that's Ozzy. Whatever. Look, Cousin Gary, I didn't mean any harm or anything, I am sorry, I didn't mean any harm. Take her home now. And tomorrow, I want you to call your dad and apologize. Call my dad? Apologize! Yes, call your dad and tomorrow I am taking you home myself, okay? Man, Cousin Gary, you are mean, totally uncool. Yeah, well, maybe I just need some sleep. Well, call, Ozzy. Really! Gary! Gary! Maris! I thought you hated me. You are evil. I am not evil, I don't hate you. I love you with all my heart. I keep saying it to understand who you are... Deep inside, I love you. Let me show you, Gary. Show you. I love you. [SCREAMS] [GASPS] Let me sleep. Please, dear god, let me sleep. [PHONE RINGING] C'mon Bud, answer the damn phone. [PHONE RINGING] [PHONE RINGING] Uh... It's three quarter, this better be good. Bud! Oh, Jesus Christ, Gary, it's 2 o'clock in the freaking morning. Listen, I know you are going nuts and all but I don't want to hear about it at 2 o'clock in the... Listen to me We have to do something about the Sandman. We have to do it now. Oh boy, the Sandman, huh! Listen, Gary, why don't you take few Valiums, sleep for about a year, huh? God! It sounds like a plan to me. He is waiting for me to go to sleep. I can feel it. I think he is watching me. Gary, my main man, you are starting to lose it big time. Would you shut up and listen? What we have to do is track this son of a bitch down. We have to hunt it down and kill it. We have to do it now. Uh... sure, Gary, whatever you say, okay? Holy cow, hey, would you look at the time? Well, Jesus, Gary, I'd love to sit here and talk with you but really got to go, okay then, Bye. [SIGHS] Jesus, Bud, how do you get hooked up with these psychos? Sandman, huh. [CHUCKLES] Oh, I give up. Okay baby, it's all about sex. You're sexy, just keep moving. That's it baby, grind it. Move to the beat, baby, that's it, fucking like a monkey. C'mon baby, move. Show me what you got. Got a better idea, why don't you show me what you've got? Oh! Baby. This Bud's for you. Oh god, baby! Yeah. Show me what you've got. Show me what you've got. [GASPING] Jesus. Wow, are you ugly. This is only a dream, isn't it? Isn't it? Oh god, I hate being such a light sleeper. [SCREAMING] Make it stop! Make it stop. [SIRENS BLARING] And when I came for my Halloween photo shoot this morning I found him in the, you know in the... in the bed. He didn't really look dead or anything I just thought he got really, really drunk last night or something. That's the third infrequent aneurysm in this week. You ever seen anything like this before? No, I'll tell you, Mitch, I don't wanna sleep at night. I don't sleep anyway, not on this damn job. Amen, brother. Nope, doesn't look like a brain embolism to me, Gary. By the way, Gary, Sandman told me to tell you stay awake. Oh, pal, take it easy. I just want to ask you a few questions about the deceased. Did you know him? Bud, was my best... friend. [DOGS HOWLING] [DOG WHIMPERING] MAN ON TV: Gee, it's been years since I got a good night sleep. How about you? WOMAN ON TV: I just can't get a good night's rest either, John. I wonder what could be keeping us awake? Tossing and turning. MAN ON TV: Wouldn't it be nice if you could just turn off the lights, slip it into the bed, get more than snug under the covers and sleep. WOMAN ON TV: [ECHOING] Boy, would it be... No... no sleep. No sleep. Wake up, wake up time for school. Wake up. That's right, you'll sleep better tonight on a coma expand mattress. Especially now. We're slashing price to the very central. C'mon and see what we've got and tell them that Sandman sent you. [GLASS SHATTERS] Please... Please, stop. [PHONE RINGING] Hello! MARIS: Gary! It's me, it's, Maris. Gary! Maris! Gary! I can't move, I am so tired. I can't move anymore. Sleep for the rest I am so tired. Stay awake, do you hear me? Stay awake! I'm going to come right over and get you, okay? Sorry, I am so sorry, Gary. I do love you. I saw him. I saw him. Bare... in the dark. Maris? He can't do this. Maris! Bastard. Hey, you big shit. You want me? You want a piece of me? Well, here I am. Dead! They're all dead. Zachariah! Wonder what's up his ass. I don't know, maybe he got a hold some of that bad hash that he's been smoking upon. You better have a real good freaking reason for breaking into my house. Unless, a man might have blown your head off, you dig? The Sandman's here. Everybody's dead. He killed them all. We have got to stop him tonight. And now, I see what you have done, Zachy. You've been blabbered about this Sandman garbage so much you got poor Gary here believe in it. You happy? Next you'll probably start having non flash backs. Damn it, woman. Don't you joke about what I did over there. Ah, what you did over there? You were a mess-cook. You only saw action once during your whole tour of duty. Yeah. I was a mess-cook if that's what you wanna call it, fine, a mess-cook. We don't have time for this bullshit. Uh... Can't go with you, Gary. I got a family that needs me. I'm an old man, just scared old man, that's all. You know what this thing is capable of? Sooner or later whether you stand in guard or not it will come here. We've got to stop it before it kills more people. I am not going with you. I don't care. I've been scared too damn long. I don't know any other way to help you. All right, then I need a gun. A couple of souvenirs from the war. What do you think? You know, I had me some years too, but the little woman made me get rid of them. If you were just a mess-cook where did you get all of this stuff? I was one hell of a cook. Maris! Maris, baby, wake up. Oh, Maris! I won't let him hurt you again, I promise. All right. We'll fight your way. Devour you. Yeah. Surprise! [SCREAMING] [GUN SHOTS] Know this, mortal, how you will suffer. If you say so, haunted face. Why don't you come over here and give it your best shot? Goodnight. [ZACHARIAH SCREAMING] I got some more mail for you. Son of a bitch... [ETHEREAL BLAST] [SCREAMS] Your light, use your light. Gary, you make a run for it. I got this asshole's number. No... [SCREAMING] [GUN SHOTS] [GROANING] Shit. Gary, help me The groins were filled with blood. Now I walk in his world. Make it stop. Oh god, no. Let us go home. Where are we? We walk in his world. Whose world? You know his name, Gary. He brought you here. How do I get back? How do I get home? None of us will ever leave here. None of us. No. No, it can't be. There're so many of them. He couldn't have killed them all. He has a system since the beginning of time from stronger to the centuries. His time in our world has come to maturity. He will drain all the life from it and keep his souls here as trophies. The sand... The sand pulls him into this one. Listen, I can stop him I know how. But first we have to get out of here. You have to show me how to do it. Maris, is your darling she is caught between this world and earth. Where? Where is the doorway? Maris, is your darling. [GROANING] No more. Please... make it stop, I can't take this. You can help me, just show me the way back. Say hello to my little friend. [SCREAMING] Gary! Gary? Welcome back to hell. No... And I brought some friends. No. Get back. Gary! Gary, Gary, wake up. Oh! Great. What the hell? [CRYING] Wait, wait. Sorry, to hear about the boy, Maris. Thanks. He was one hell of a nice kid. Excuse me, ma'am, we'd like to ask you a few questions about the deceased. It's him. Are you sure? Okay... I'm gonna give you something that's gonna make you sleep. Okay, Miss Peralta, and wait in the hospital. Now this will make you go to sleep soon. Every thing's gonna be just fine. You just need your rest, that's all. [GROANING] [GASPS] Jesus! What hit me? Oh my god! Maris! What happened? Ah, don't ask. I didn't... What's wrong? No! Oh my god! No. What's happening? What's going on? [SCREAMING] [SIRENS BLARING] [END TITLE MUSIC]
