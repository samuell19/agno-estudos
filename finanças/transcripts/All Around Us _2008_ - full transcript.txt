Winter 1993 Three times a week! Incredible! Not really. Isn't three times a week tough? That's tough. Once I was choked so hard I thought I'd die. No sense dying for that. - So I quit hooking. - Good idea to quit. It's all about endurance. Endurance... ...and patience. That's marriage. That's boring! We don't do it, been together so long. Us too, since college. On and off. - How old is he? - 30, same as me. Still a live wire. You must get along. We like the same food. That's key. Why does it make men happy when I swallow it? Well, y'know... You don't have to. But I do. You do? They pay more. How much? 2,000 yen. It's amazing. I guess. Are you free? Yeah, why? Grab a bite? Yeah, let's! OK, let's. He'll always play around. So, leave him. I'll manage, if I stay strong. You're tough! My old lady's tough. I come home late, right? She'll grab my hand and lick it. See, if I'd been with a woman, I'd take a shower. She can tell with a lick. She's tough. Makes me think marriage isn't worth it. Don't get me wrong. Marriage is good. There you go again! That hurts! Gururi no koto July 1993 Is this too bold? It is bold... But it does have impact. What do you think? These covers... That one's good. Pay attention! Come here and look at them! All you eat is eggs, that's why your farts stink! Come on, now. This one's good. But this is a better fit. I managed a bookstore for 12 years. I can take one look at a cover and tell if it'll sell or not. This one. OK. I'll ask the author. Thanks. Starting to show. Am 1? Shall I go instead? No, I'm fine. Say hello for me. Kokubo, book the release. Got it. Want one of these? No, thanks. Don't you need your calories? These have lots of sugar. It'd be a shame for these to go to waste. Here, eat some. OK, this one. Thanks. Eating again? Watch the crumbs. There goes the diet. She got dumped. Again? Don't say "again." Doesn't anyone know a good man? With round shoulders... Why that? They say they're passionate. OK, I'm off. Take care. This is awful news. Terrible... You could try a hair band. They attract men? What do you do? Well... I bet you work hard. 'Cause your heels are worn down. You must work hard, right? That's an incredible green dress... Geez, this is hard. Hitting on women in a place like that! You haven't changed a bit. I'm amazed you're married. Well, she got pregnant. Pregnant? Congrats! So, what did you want? It's like this. Hey, could you put on the news? "Earthquake Hits Okushiri Island" You know I'm working in TV. Oh, that's right. Art design, chief. And sometimes I work for the news. News? Yeah. That. That's what I do. Lend me a cigarette. Last one. "Courtroom artist," they call it. I want you to take over for me. Me? 80,000 yen per sketch. - Good pay. - Not bad, right? But why... I get that on the side, on top of my salary. The other guys think it's unfair and give me shit. Please. Sounds scary... criminals and all. Nah. You go, do a sketch, that's it. You're having a baby. You could quit that lousy job. But... nothing you've passed on to me ever worked out. Don't be such a wimp! You never were. Or were you? You're angry? We decided the curfew was 10. Yeah. Well, then... Why are you always late on our "X" days? That's not true... is it? Well, maybe... What? What was that? You're jumping to conclusions again. No, you're wrong. I had a drink with Natsume. You borrowed money again! No way! Why see that jerk anyway? Don't move that. Well, he... He's always been good to me. It's not what you think. He's passing some work on to me. Work? He works in TV, right? It's like, courtroom art. Sketching criminals. Y'know, like you see on TV. I said I'd do it... for now. And the shoe shop? Well, that job... I suppose I'll quit... probably. Shall we split up? You're decisive. I envy that. Making fun of me? Anyway... let's talk after we've done what we agreed on. What we agreed on? We're doing it tonight. Really? Geez... Right now... In this mood... I don't think I can get it up. I'm just... soft. But tonight we do it, right? We agreed. Yeah, but... You make too many rules. You don't do what we agree on, so I have to make rules. You're pregnant. Shouldn't we take it easy? I'm past the danger zone. So we'll do it. Right? OK. Put on some lipstick. Something... Lipstick... or something. Why should I use lipstick? I'm not sure I should say this, but... Look, I come home, right... to an angry woman eating a banana. Then, all of a sudden... it's not exactly a turn-on. I wouldn't need a banana if you'd come home. It's not the banana. You think it's enough just to do it, somehow. It's not. I'm saying you need some hospitality. Hospitality? So, lipstick, that'd work? Say, when you cook something, you don't just toss it on the table. You stew it carefully, remove the bones from the fish, you make it delicious, and on top of that, you put it in a pretty dish... you design the presentation. The way you see it, if the food is good, throw it on a paper plate, it's all the same in the end. Why is this a paper plate? It's a good example, don't you get it? That's what I'm saying. So, put on some lipstick. All right... I'll wear lipstick. 1 will. I mean, I'll give it a try. I'll try, but not tonight. I don't feel that way. What way? Put some on now. No, I can't. I will, starting next time... Next time, when? The next "X"... Wednesday. Don't schedule it! If you do, the lipstick is just, like, on the menu. It's because you're so loose that I want to decide things. You never show up on time... So, for starters, y'know... OK, say there's a street light. Red is stop, yellow is caution, green is go. I don't know who decided that, but everyone obeys. Right? So, you have to obey our rules, too. I'm not sure I get you. Wait... People obey traffic lights because they don't want to die. That's right. But, sometimes... a little danger... a little risk is a lot more fun. Let's skip across on the red light. No. Let's just walk across. OK? OK. Now's no time to eat that banana. Close the door... Let's leave the light on. What?! I told you not to do that. What's the idea? I thought the other hole was worth a try. It's not, idiot! Don't call me idiot. Idiot. Don't call me idiot...

It's not allowed. But he's the reason for this trial. Let me speak with the judge. There's no need to. Why can't we? Come on, loosen up. The courtroom is now open. Please hand in your passes. Please don't run. Take your time. Don't rush. There are plenty of seats. Please don't run in the courtroom. Verdict in a Trial for Manslaughter in the Conduct of Business Be seated. Court is in session. Defendant, come forward. I will now read the verdict. Please listen. Yes. The decision is lengthy, so please have a seat. Ah, yes. In the case of Kuramochi Takafumi... Quiet! If you make noise, you will be removed. The verdict in the case of Kuramochi Takafumi, for involuntary manslaughter in the conduct of business. The sentence. The defendant is sentenced to two years in prison. However, for the period of five years probation, this sentence is suspended. You must be kidding! Murderer! Quiet in the courtroom, please! I will now state our findings. The court finds the facts as follows. On the morning of June 22, 1992, the defendant was driving a large truck, in the conduct of business. At an intersection in Honancho, in Suginami Ward in Tokyo, he drove toward Honancho, 5-chome. There is poor visibility at this corner, and the driver is required to slow and confirm that the street is clear. Neglecting his duty to drive safely, he entered the intersection, at 30 to 40 kilometers per hour. His truck collided with a passenger car, entering the intersection from the left. The car crashed into a cement-block wall, colliding with a motorbike, driven by Sasabe Shingo, a 21-year old college student... The family's furious. What's up? His employer's talking. Are you going? Right away. Excuse me. What is it? The boss is talking! Be right back. Are you done? We dispatch in 5 minutes. We'll go with that for now. Over here. Ah, there you are! We're leaving. He's out! Been up all night. What's the lead? We'll go with stocks. Stocks? - All right? - Not yet. Wait a minute. I drew another. Ready? Put it up here. This is no good. Do something! Ah! That's worse! - I like this look. - Come on. Are you Sato? Sorry I've neglected you. It's been crazy. Finished? It's smudged. But it'll do. These are shot on video, so draw larger next time. OK. Do this one first. Thanks. So he'll shoot it, and the courier's waiting over there. Give him the tape, and you're done. Got the flow? If you have questions, ask a veteran. Yoshizumi... This guy's a rookie, help him out, OK? He's a little strange. Oh, Hashimoto! This is a new sketcher... How much do you make? Always talking money... How much per sketch? More than me, right? Let's leave that alone. This work doesn't pay. Can't do it for long. For an artist like me, it gets frustrating. Come on, it's meaningful work. Yeah, and Nitto pays well. See you. So, that's about it. Look after that guy. Always slacking off. You're so strict, Yasuda. You blew it bad. What? Oh, that? They switched lead stories, it was crazy... Pardon me. Is this yours? Excuse me. Shall I fix it for you? It's a talent of mine. I work in a shoe repair shop... See you all later. Later. Have some of this. It's good. Masako, Masako. Here, there you go. I offer you a job in real estate, but you've got to paint, huh? Why do people even go to art school? Look at you. You end up at a cheap publisher, selling cheap books. They're not cheap... To your brother, they are. I made good money doing portraits in Ueno Park. You never made good money. You should paint dolphins. We spent a bundle on one. Hey. Here, Shoko. What's this? Wow. It's a marriage gift. It's too much money. Don't be silly. Go ahead, take it. Don't worry. We want to. It includes a baby gift. Besides, you never had a wedding. Did you see the crown prince's wedding on TV? It was beautiful. "I'll protect you with all my strength." I'll look after this, OK? Ah, hello, sir. Oh, thank you very much, sir. Don't let him cry. I can't help it! Don't talk nonsense. Get my address book. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes... Come here. You sure about him? You can do better. Friends from work? Out for Chinese? Go to Mama! Sorry. For what? Whatever. The chili shrimp was delicious. I ate too much. He shows off just like my father used to. But that waitress! She should stay out of Chinese dresses. Dreadful... Oh! It moved. Does that... make you happy? February 1994 In Memory of Our Infant Girl Hello? Yes, this is Monju Press. Thank you for calling... Trial for the Murder of a Preschool Girl Tired. Want to go. Be patient. Well... Was it hard to cut off the head and hands? Not. And then? Ate 'em. What part did you eat? Fingers. Tore 'em, ate 'em. I see, yes. Well, then... Those fingers... did you eat them raw? Some raw. Some broiled. Ah... Did you use any flavoring? Your affidavit said you used soy sauce. Well? You used soy sauce. Whatever. Well, then... How about the blood? You spread a plastic sheet and cut up the victim. Wasn't there a lot of blood? What did you do with the pool of blood? Drank it. Gulp. Human flesh has got to taste awful. Flavored with soy sauce? Disgusting. Soy sauce... It's a sunny day... But I was pressed for time. Still, you can't change a text without permission. I had no choice. His review trashed the book. The author'd be furious. Well... that may be true. But, you should explain, ask him to revise it. But there wasn't time for that. Maybe so. In any case, I went and apologized. Why did you do that? Because he called... You should tell me. He was livid. Where does that leave me? - That's not the issue. - What? It's not where you stand. Unilaterally changing an author's text... I changed it, there wasn't time. Changing a text, as an editor, that's a problem. A problem? Problem? I'm a problem? I'm not saying that. But you just go and apologize? The book will be late. That's fine by me. Totally. Come on now. Both of you... Ticks me off. Don't mind... All right, ready? OK, cheers! - Kale juice? - Yeah. Looks awful. These parties started when Yasuda made curry one day. Today's a belated welcome for you, Sato. Excuse me a sec. These things absorb smells. Sakota was a cop, drew suspect sketches. Hashimoto was an illustrator. Yoshizumi did newspaper drawings. Lampoons. Oh, that's right. And you? Ah, this and that. Settled in? Yeah. But days like today... Yeah, really. What'll it be? The death penalty. Depends on the psychiatrist. He ate the victim... Enough of that. It's hard to sketch his frame. Sure is. He's tough to draw. He had beautiful fingers. Such smooth skin. You artists are fascinating. You might just be getting the essence there. But your reporting always hits home. When the trial opened, he asked for the death sentence. That surprised me. His attitude is different now. There's that maggot story... Right, Sakota? There was the corpse, see? After a while, maggots all over it. The police arrived, and the maggots all run for cover. Even to maggots, life is precious, but he stood there, asking for the death penalty... Why's that? His father committed suicide. Just ran away from it all. Such a burden on everyone else. You're out of beer. Some more? Oh, sure. Thanks. Well... I'll be going. What, the star is leaving? I've got work. Besides, the star is the rookie here. Have some curry, sister! No thanks. This just tastes hot is all. He put in too much spice. Do you have kids? No. How about you? A pain in the ass. You're married, right? Inertia. A pain in the ass. She says, "If it's such a pain, why not die?" How do you answer that? Dying's a pain in the ass. Yasuda, y'know... His daughter died in a car crash. He's separated from his wife. On his days off, he goes to the traffic prison, stands at the wall and listens to inmates. Warped, huh? It is. Well, it takes all kinds. I'll be taking the subway. Good night, then. It's no larger than your place. A change of scenery. What's this? This's no good. Have to get the mats changed. And... the lights... What's with this? Yeah, hello. Yeah, yeah... We'll just have to remodel the place. What? So, that's why. What? We might need to do an exorcism. Draw up an estimate... So, write up an estimate. Thanks. Woman killed herself. Burned herself up. She could have just jumped... What do you think? It'll go fast, this time of year. Yeah... Want to get some lunch? Pork Cutlets Yachiyo Fried dregs. Keep it down. It's OK. This is awful. Look, it's why there are no customers. That's OK, sit down. Where's the wife? On a day trip... A day trip? The hot springs again? She's got it easy. Right? Since the son took over, the shop's gone down the tubes. Right, man? I wonder about him. They're all "otaku" these days. Look at that. Our old man. The owner was a big supporter when he was playing ball. I don't know what the old man's doing or where, but if he's like this guy, he's done for. Stop that. It's OK. I'm helping out. Don't worry. I'll talk to the bank. So, what's with you? Hunh? Are you feeling OK? Yeah... And him? Working? The trials and teaching too. So, you're doing OK? Yeah... Good. Fried dregs... To be the first Japanese woman in space will be thrilling. And experiments are coming from around the world. In that sense, it's going to be a very meaningful flight. In just one month, Mukai will realize her dream. Don't rub too hard, it'll get messy. How's this, here? That's fine, but watch for smears. The eyes got much too big. No, they're fine. Worry-Free Pregnancy, Birth and Child-Rearing One, two... I've got this end. I'm going on up. "Daughter. Girl. Child." He drew this... He was really happy. Why didn't he say so? He gets hard at the sight of a condom. Hey, hey, I ain't that bad. Mr. Virility. The face of lust. But, y'know, I still have wet dreams. What? You're kidding! - Really? - The other night... You're an idiot. No, I just have vigor. So, I dreamed I was having mega sex with a gorgeous woman. It was getting heavy, "No, no! I'm going to come!" I came. I woke up, and found my cat sitting on my crotch. You idiot! The warmth of the cat... You are a bit wacko. Shoko, join us. Sorry, I should... Shoko, listen to this. This guy pees in the bath. - Sure, why not? - Yecch! - But, not in the tub. - I'd hope not. You get on well. Well, we're newlyweds. Does he say if he's happy or sad? Huh? Shoko, warm this up? See who's the boss. Of course, who else? Sorry, I'll do that. I'll put this in the pot now, OK? What is it? A spider! Spider! Ah, ah... a spider! I'm sorry, I spilled. - Where? Where? - There it is. Stop! Why? A spider, it'll come out at night... No, no, no! A house spider's a good omen, don't kill it! Well, I guess that's right. - Let him join the party. - No way! - Hang on. - Here's the spider. - You're kidding. - Oh, it's a shrimp. What a shock! Where'd it go? I don't know. Where's the tofu? July 1995 Well, hello there. Witness, court is in session. Witness! Please continue. Trial for Prostitution I really have no idea.

Were those cult members in white robes? I suppose so. Pain in the ass. Oh, hi. You seem happy. No, not at all. Oh, did you hear Yasuda might be transferred? He had a run-in with his boss. He gets too involved, especially in car crash trials. But you, always calm and cool. Cool is Number 1! Take care of this. Here... Edvard Munch! I've been searching... Huh? Just to confirm, your husband has agreed to this abortion. Yes. All right, we'll begin preparations. "Abortion Consent Form" All right, we'll begin preparations.

Do you know true tenderness? The author of "Children of Love", Sara Crays, is signing her book. Book-signing here. If you can't find a reason to live, this book is for you. Would you like a copy?

What is it? Come! Yoshida This will prick a little. Thank you. Take care. Thanks for these. Oranges. She's not long for this world. Her blood was black. You have to stop. What? You'll get arrested someday. I'm helping people. You cut people with a razor. Remember... I used to bleed your father, when he was still playing ball. The next day, his shoulders were loose and he fielded better. Didn't help his hitting much. Anyway... take this. I can't walk right now. What's wrong? A sprain. You do that often. Shoko, please... Could you put this on? Where? Around here. You look pale. Are you pregnant again? You really shouldn't. Babies die because the man's sperm is weak, they say. Stop. His family didn't visit you when the baby was born. They don't get along. Why do you care? There, done! Ow! What's that? The rainwater god. Another crazy fad? I pray for your baby too. No one asked you. What's the harm? Anyway... I hear that he's living in Nagoya. Who? Your father. Uncle Taro heard it from an old member of his fan club. That's fine with me. Fine with you? He leaves us, runs off with a woman! I raised you, do you know how hard that was? It's no joke. You could kill him. What are you saying? This god sure smells like chlorine. Couples grow more alike... You sound just like your husband. No, I don't. Y'know... Nagoya is... Hey... Shoko! Shoko! What's wrong? Shoko! What's wrong? Hey... Shoko! October 1997 "Kosuge Mental Clinic” There you are.

I don't have to, do ll? No... but you'll do it. It's our job, people want to see. I don't want to see it. It's all arranged. And also... he needs to look more evil. This has no impact. Here... Thanks a lot. Where's Yasuda? Over there. How's it going? Finished. That felt great. What is that? The water is infused with herbs. It's refreshing, isn't it? Thank you. Excuse me, then. - Oh, here. - Thanks. Now don't you be smoking. You've got emphysema. You... Sure that's OK? It's all right. What twist of fate brings you? I thought you hated me. Not at all.

What's an old cutlet shop owner with bad legs gonna do with that? It was pointless, so I got them to drop it to 40 million. Dummy. Then he takes the money and runs. What'll you do? You can't use that bank again. During the bubble, the banks would kiss ass. Took people drinking in the Ginza, million-yen tabs everyday. But the hostesses were rotten back then, body and soul. I'd doze off, and they'd dump champagne and order another. I watched once, eyes half-closed. Now 5 or 6 are in the sex trade. One called, asking for a loan, but I hung up. - We need a loan. - Shut up. But it's true. This one used to work as an escort. She's not so different. She'd ignore clients, hide and drink herself. And she'd get paid to do that. Stay away. I've got asthma. Animal hair is the worst. At it again. They don't train it, so the whole house smells of pee. Still not talking to Masako? Why should 1? It's been months, since they moved in! I just want them to leave. Because of the slump, they didn't make anything on their condo. Real estate is gambling, just like baseball players. No good. - This goes out? - Yeah. Uncle Taro could send money instead of a ton of fish. I hear you quit your job? Yeah. And you're seeing a psychiatrist? A psychosomaticist. They're different? We're applying to nursery schools. This could affect our chances. You gonna be OK? Keihoku's gonna be tough anyway... You should have another baby. Having a baby changes you. It did me, I felt like it purged my soul. I really hate fish, y'know. Fran... Stay! Watch the ball, Genki! Quiet down, now... It's 'cause you ignore them. Genki, come over here. Light the candles, will you? Y'know, today's your birthday... Wha... what? This... and this... aren't these the old man's? Where'd you find them? Guess who? - Guess who? - Stop that! Shoko! Hey, you'll make your Grandma angry. No throwing the ball. Takuya, want some cake? Have some egg. Shoko, listen to this. That jar of water cost 100,000 yen. She could spend that on her grandsons. If you paid rent, I'd happily buy them candy. Rent?! Mother, I think we've put a good deal of money into this house. And that made you feel good. It feels good to spend money, right? So, fine. What?! The way you talk! Hey, did you hear that? What a horrible thing to say! That's horrible! Her son and grandsons! Enough... The candles'll burn out. What's with this girl? Genki! Come over here! It's your 7th birthday. Now, you need to make a wish. Like, the house will sell... The house will sell... Good job. Blow out the candles. All right! Happy birthday! Happy birthday, Genki! Trial for the Murder of a Kindergartner Examination of the Witness Examination of the Witness Since ours is an established family, Since ours is an established family, I had little in common with "that." Still... it wouldn't be fair to ignore her. So I invited her to Smiley Club, and to gatherings of the other mothers. She should have been grateful. There was no reason to hate me, much less any reason for her to kill our daughter. "That" may go to prison, but her character won't change. I ask for the death penalty. Excuse me. By "that," you mean the defendant? Yes. Examination of the Defendant I have done an unforgivable wrong... I'm sorry, could you speak up? I know I have done an unforgivable wrong to Mrs. M. And "Mrs. M" is...? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was unforgivable. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ah, defendant? Defendant... Ah... By "M," you mean the previous witness? Yes. I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Defendant... Typhoon #20 is heading north, moving slowly... Here you go. I'm in charge of our curry parties, and today we welcome our first female art student... What's that? - A toupee? - Couldn't tell? Not at all. Sure you could. This is cute! Cute, huh? Sorry, I'm heading home. See you later. How come? What a shrill voice. I hate thunder. The rug is crooked now. It's too crooked. Has the rain started? I'm home. I'm home. What're you doing? Look. I bought the Golden Pavilion. 1:100 scale, but... The typhoon is really something, isn't it? You'll catch cold. I killed the baby. It couldn't be helped. Don't blame yourself. It was fate. Did it make you sad? I thought it was too bad. Too bad? Why do you say things like that? You know I can't talk about these things. If I died, would you cry? Or would it be "too bad"? Are you good if you cry? You can't tell from that. When my old man hanged himself, I didn't cry. People will betray you, that's what I thought. My mother and others cried and cried, but it was just to satisfy themselves. Even today, no one knows why he had to die. You can't know what goes on in a person's heart. I'll turn the light on. Oh, what's that? A spider... A spider... The Golden Pavilion crushed him. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I get it, I get it! You don't, you don't get a thing! Sorry, sorry... Don't hit me. Sorry, sorry. Would you mind keeping it down? I mean, I'm not well... You and your damn bike! My bike's not the problem here. Of all the nerve! Hush, now. We're sorry. Idiot! I don't know what to do anymore. Things don't always work out. I wanted... I wanted to do things better. But... I couldn't. Maybe... we won't have... any babies. The baby... if we remember her... maybe never forgetting is the best we can do. You worry too much, you're always thinking. Let people dislike you, and be loved a lot by the one you love. But the one I love... do we really know each other? He's here by my side... but is he here for me? I don't know. Don't worry. Why do you think that way? Somehow... the distance... I know the distance is growing, and I don't know what to do. You think too much. Think too hard, and everything gets confused. Why... why are you with me? Because I love you. I love you, so I want to be with you. If you weren't here, I'd be lost. You don't have to do things right, just be here with me. I wanted... to do everything right. But... I couldn't. I'm sorry... sorry. Sorry... sorry. I want to kiss you, but your nose is running so. It won't stop running. OK, now, blow. It's so gooey, I'm sorry. A lot came out. Yeah, that's a lot. Don't look. Does it hurt? My face hurts. If you do that, it stinks. I like your hands... I like your hands. They're tiny. But small hands are better. Why? 'Cause when you hold your dick, it looks bigger. You idiot. Don't call me idiot. We'll have to make a grave for the spider. July 1998 Remember the twist at the end. OK, present it. Thank you. Tastes good. Thanks. Don't get up. Don't mind... here. An ice bar. I have these for kids. Your face has changed. When Dr. Kosuge first sent you, your face was hard and tense. So, want to try some paintings? I want to start remodeling. I haven't painted in years, since college. You'll do fine. There are many famous painters, but they don't interest me. Ceiling paintings? Japanese painting... isn't my strength. But you've been through something. It's important to consider death. I'm interested in what you'll paint. That's incredible pressure. Relax, relax, take it easy. Living's a skill, like painting. These will melt. Right, thanks. Delicious. Hits the spot. You've watered the plants. Hunh? Yeah. Delicious. It dripped. It tastes alive. Give it a shot. Hmm... I'm jealous. My courtroom art disappears. Yeah, and you majored in Japanese painting. You liked the artist Jakuchu. Yeah. Give it a try. Hey! What're you doing? It's gotten smaller. I haven't been using it, y'know. Hey, what's with you? Are you OK? I banged 'em pretty good. You OK? They padded their expenses on overseas trips, and embezzled 300 million yen from a government slush fund. The 3 defendants had sexual liaisons, Trial for Embezzling Public Funds and to fulfill desires, Trial for Embezzling Public Funds Trial for Embezzling Public Funds like owning race horses, they spent tax money as if it was water. Pretty close, huh? Right? Poor thing, how can you eat that? Why are you saying that? I'm not picky about food. Then why? Shiitakes are penguin meat. Why penguin meat? My uncle told me. The cherries are gorgeous. The Cult Subway Gas Attack Trial It's wretched, pathetic, sad. It's wretched, pathetic, sad. I didn't leave my life behind in order to kill people. There's no way to apologize... Quiet in the courtroom! Not absolute happiness... ordinary happiness. Quiet in the courtroom! Quiet in the gallery! Trial for the Murder of Elementary School Students And the victims' families? Trial for the Murder of Elementary School Students Trial for the Murder of Elementary School Students Do you intend to apologize? Do you intend to apologize? No. I want an apology. From the whole world. But I guess I do have one regret. If I'd beaten 100 kindergartners to death, instant death penalty. I screwed up. Where was it? - This is the wrong way. - Turn there. All right, I'll turn there. Oooh, yummy. Why don't you ask Katsutoshi? May 2000 Why don't you ask Katsutoshi? Why don't you ask Katsutoshi? Yeah. OK. OK. What is it? It's cancer, my father. Really? Mother wants me to see him in Nagoya. You have to, then. It's always me at times like this. Shall I go along? There's a trial in Wakayama. We can go together. Ah! I hate this! Nagoya Room 511, please. One moment, please. Wish we were them? Unh-unh. Let's go. No, no, listen... It's an idea... Just an idea. But I think it's a good idea. The real estate market is down... Exactly. Your firm is large and reliable, Uncle Taro. You'll handle the resale, and that'll save bundles of money. Right? Sell the house? We resell to his company and mine, there'll be a small profit. But that's... we're all family. That's how I see it. Thank you. I've done what I could, I backed you when you set up shop, I got you started in school after the old man left. You've always looked out for us. And, Namiko, is it 15 years now? All this time, pretending the old man is dead. You could easily get a divorce. It's a waste. You're still an attractive woman. Where would she go? If we moved to an apartment, she'd have less space, it's true. If that's no good, there's you guys. Come on... Live together? Huh? I refuse. Don't be saying that. Nowadays, you can't find a daughter-in-law who's willing. You should be thankful. It's not that I want to, we'd sell the house because we're broke. He's being considerate, but... It's a good time to do this. Norifumi has cancer... At least you should get the deed changed. If you hesitate, his woman could inherit it. So, how was he? We did see him. And her? Late-stage? Can he talk? Well... He was fine. - Not dying? - Why not? Why not?! You drive me crazy. The way you are... Yeah? I draw... so I made some sketches. Sketches?! At a time like this? Not that. Here. What, this is Norifumi? Well, it's... not. That's pathetic. He used to be such a rock of a man, now he's an old woman. You draw as bad as always. This doesn't look like him. And he's fine? He's paying for running away. You're really disappointed, he's not dying... - Seems the cancer was real bad. - What kind? Ah, what was it? Around here, in the belly... You should've asked. It's spread all over, so... But now it's better? It's a miracle. The doctors said so. That happens, sometimes. Must have been the great care. The power of love, or something. Sponge baths, head to toe, with a towel soaked in herbs. Said it was relaxing, invigorating. Bedridden, the toileting... taking it with cupped hands, like this... That's devotion. Are you kidding? Nothing to laugh about. We still need to change the deed, right? You keep quiet. Hey, quiet down! He looked old? Yeah. It's the spunky ones who end up like this. But look at it this way. It's really something to still be living, after all that. When did you draw that? He was smiling... had a gentle face, right? Yeah... Seemed happy. Is he? It made me think... people do change. He apologized. Said, "Thank you for coming," he bowed to me. Really... This looks like the old man. More than the other one. It's topsy-turvy... Topsy... turvy? The story's reversed. Ah, I get it... What? Is this some family secret? What?! It's OK, leave it be. Divorce papers. He sent these a long time ago. But I never filed them. I won't sell this place. The two of you can manage. You've got each other. What'll we do? Shut up, it's OK. Well, I'll be going. Deal with this as a family. I'm sorry, Uncle. And, Namiko... C'mon, clean that up. And, Ma... Ma, I'm sorry. Ah, I've never had any luck with real estate. Hey... you're all wet! And you, too. Come on, change clothes. Thanks, both of you. Actually... the one who cheated... was me. What? He grandstanded, but he was actually a mouse, a straight arrow, and he never forgave me. In that way, he was a lot like you. He's nursing her with such care, she must be a good woman. Mother-... Kanao. Yes? Take good care of Shoko, please. July 2001 They're good... they have presence.

The defendant, Oma Shinji, on December 8, 1998, armed with a knife, entered a grade school and killed 16 children... Step... mother... Defendant, stop that! You're not the mother, quit pretending! Makes me sick. You will be removed. You're just acting sad! All of you... It's all a lying, stinking act! Be quiet! Restrain him. Restrain him! You... all of you... die! Death to you all! Die! Die! Die! Die! How awful! What was that? Defendants read the files, all about the victim's life. That's not right! I was so angry, I couldn't draw. An artist has to draw that face. What? Are you serious? You're back? Learned how to draw? Going full throttle. Really? And you? Full throttle. Gotta write my piece, or I'll get squeezed out. People, people...
