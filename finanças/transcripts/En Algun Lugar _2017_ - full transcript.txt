(dramatic music) (foreign language music playing) (speaking foreign language) - [Woman] Lock her up. - [DJ Maria] 10:05 this glorious Tuesday morning good morning Chicago, it is August 4th! - [DJ David] Good morning 76 degrees at this time and the maximum for today would be 83 degrees, and we can expect this type of weather all week. - [DJ Maria] Thank God 'cause I need to catch up on my gardening. - [DJ David] That's if you can get home because it is construction season. - [DJ Maria] Oh, you know we're pretty much used to this in Chicago, you know what there's two only two seasons here, it's either winter or construction. (upbeat music) And now on to more serious news, you know David the front use in today's paper really has me a little bit concerned. It's talking about the U.S. government planning mass deportations of illegal immigrants. It's talking about next year in 2016 how the United States government is preparing for raids on undocumented people. - [DJ David] You are not kidding, and you know what? Government officials told The Wall Street Journal the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Unit of the Department of Homeland Security will target and deport hundreds of families who have ignored immigration court orders to leave this country. - [DJ Maria] This concerns me because I'm not sure if you're aware but. - [Braulio] So what happened, any update on the case? I mean you're one of us now, or? - [Diego] Continued. - [Braulio] Again? - Yeah, I feel like they're giving me the real runaround now what sucks the most is the feeling they give you. - [Braulio] What do you mean? - They look at you like you're a felon. I mean you can constantly ask for a visa but you have to be in Mexico for that, and that's the one place I want to avoid. - Keep your head up all right? It's gonna all work out in the end I promise. - Yeah, you're right I suppose the consulate here can't really do anything from there end. And maybe I should put the lottery but who knows, if I win maybe I'll just hire Johnny Cochran? - He's dead dude. - Just like all the other things. - You know what make you feel better? A ride on the El, I shit you not the people, or I prefer to call the characters do wonders for the soul. Especially when you're having a bad day. - Are you sure they gave you coffee and not espresso? - Whatever bitch. - Oh my God! - I'm am sorry. - What the hell man? Oh my God. I'm gonna call you back. - [Diego] I am so sorry. - Oh, my God. You know what? Don't worry about it, I shouldn't have been on my phone. If there's one thing this state should ban is walking and talking on your phone it would make more sense than all the other laws they're passing right now. - Here, hope this helps. Hi, sorry. - I can get you another coffee if you want. - No, it's fine really. - No it's not this cost me six bucks. - Shit I. - Don't worry about it just a shirt. It'll probably come out in the wash actually. What are you doing? - Here it's just my number you know just in case. - In case of what? - In case you want me to pay for your dry cleaning bill, you know for your shirt. - Okay. I'm Abel. - Diego. (phone vibrating) - I have to take this. Bye. - I mean Abel? Sounds a little biblical if you ask me. Then again, Abel was the first man on earth. Imagine the possibilities. - Don't you mean first son? - Whatever, you get my point. (hip hop playing) - Queen. Hey it says here that Lucky Charms Fruity Pebbles and Fruit Loops cereals are indirectly pro gay. - Does it say that there is that just you talking? - Abel, don't take this the wrong way, but you are a thicker than a bowl of oatmeal. - Really, you coming for me right now? - Yeah you got a muffin top yo. Hey, at least you're feeling fresh am I right? - Shit. - What? - [Abel] Nothing. - What? - Nothing, it's just been a day. - [Stephen] Yeah you want to talk about it? - Nah. - I'm just going to keep getting ready, and you keep looking at those pretty pictures in the magazine. - Ready. Check that out. - I look like that. - Yeah, you would look like that if you worked out like me. (laughter) Hey, you can turn it up all you want, you sure as hell can't turn down that waistline bitch. - [Abel] Slut. ♪ Set your ghost where you want 'em ♪ (upbeat music) - How about you just get off that phone and let's go, besides I don't think that app is gonna be going anywhere. - But this is important. - How is that important don't you know the overabundance of guys were about to see? - Get with the times Diego. - I'm just saying that sometimes the old fashioned way is best. - Hey, remember that guy I was telling you about, Manhorse Sal? - Yeah, yeah wasn't he, was he the one that I talked you out of hooking up with? - That's the one. - So why are you still talking to him? - I never said anything about talking to him, I followed your advice, but you never told me not to follow him. - [Diego] Isn't that called stalking? - Any crap he's been putting up numbers, he's been posting pics an account of all the dudes he's been hooking up with. - Ew. So what's his count? - All right fuck it let's check. So he was just at 59 a few hours ago. - 59! - And he was at 61 yesterday. - What'd he do, did he take a shit or something? - He was at he's at 67 with the total count. - There's got to be a better way for you to see you guys. - Spilling coffee on them is definitely not one. (laughter) - What place you taking guys to anyway? - Doesn't matter, as long as the boys are hot and the drinks are cheap. - Well, just remember that I can't stay out too late tonight, all right? - We'll keep our eyes and nose, and whatever that saying is we'll keep that on. - Okay. - And as cliche as the sounds just remember, we're there to unwind to the moderate mix of the tacrazy.

(groans) - Nice to see you. - I hate that guy. - What? - Well I fucked him. Okay, that's why I don't like coming out here. - Holy shit brother look! - Look at well what? You taking your sweet ass time with your (speaking foreign language) coffee? - No, no, no dude, look, across the street. It's that guy from the consulate. - [Braulio] Where? - [Diego] There in line at that club. Nah, forget it though, he's seeing some guy. - Well just would just go over there and you know, and check it out. - I'm good, let's just go. - Come on, if it helps I'll hold the coffee for you. I mean, you never know this might be my time to find Mr. Right. - You do know that coffee in your hands is like a recipe for danger right? - That was one time Diego, one time! - Okay, well I'm just saying let's not repeat it.

(soft music) - Freda. - I'm sorry? - The button on your bag it's Freda Khalo, right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, my friend Bella made it. - Yeah, she's cool. - So what brings you here on this fine day? - Just looking for books, how about you? - Same, except that I got a little distracted. - [Abel] Nice, you already have some I take it? - Not yet, I've been thinking about it hard though. We'll see. I'm not like one of those kids from like a broken home or anything. (laughter) - No judgment here. well, I'll let you get back to your work and don't worry I won't tell, it'll be our little secret. (laughs) (soft music) (laughs) Hi, can I pay for these please? - It's 57.93. - Why didn't I just talk to him? Hey! - Hey! (breathing hard) Hey, are you okay? - [Abel] Fine. (bus driving off) (breathing hard) - There goes my ride. - Oh man, I'm so sorry. I guess I'm not as young as I used to be. (laughter) It's not funny. - I guess I could say no judgment on my end. I mean as long as your boyfriend's okay with you running up to random guys on the street? - Who says I have a boyfriend? (laughs) You hungry? I know a nice place around here we can go relax, and I can catch my breath. (laughs) - I could eat. - Good it's this way. - Lead the way. - Okay. (laughs) - You should jog more often, that's kinda embarrassing. (upbeat music) - It's one of the many things my mom taught me when I was young. - I take it your parents know about you then? - Yeah, you can say that. - They cool with it. - My mom is. My dad he's never really been in the picture. They separated when I was younger. What about your parents, how'd they take it? - I knew this was coming. - Hey, I gave you my brief history, now it's your turn. - They died when I was little and then my grandmother raised me and then she died when I was 17 and it's been just me ever since. - I'm sorry. (restaurant chatter) - So you're a (speaking foreign language) then huh? - (speaking foreign language), orphan? Yes. - I mean I didn't know that you were one of us. - Technically, (speaking foreign language), yes. But who knows, maybe I was lucky though right? I never had to do the whole coming out spectacle, and I never got kicked out of my house or anything like that. - Oh, I'm glad you had such a great experience. (laughs) - We can't dwell in the past. Besides, it got me where I am today. - [Diego] Where's that? - Social work. And the cool thing is I work for a gay rights organization. I mentor kids so they can grow up and have positive experiences. - Interesting. - You say that like it's a bad thing. - [Diego] No one's said anything? - What? - It's not just about them. - [Abel] Them? - I don't like how society thinks that were just one thing. Now there's all kinds of kids everywhere that have it bad, we're not just who we have sex with, we're way more than that. I'm sorry. (laughs) What are you thinking about? - You. So what's next? (upbeat music) Do you like dancing? - [Stephen] Hey! - Hey! - Hi, hi, hi, hi. How are you? - [Stephen] Doing all right. - Stephen this is Diego. - Hey, it's nice to meet you. - Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit, it's nice to finally meet you. - Yeah, you too. - I guess that one of us growing old and getting all those cats, just went out the window. - Okay, I don't know what it is with you and cats, stop. - [Steve] Whatever bitch, hey, can I buy you a drink? - I'll be right back, I got to go to the restroom. - Okay. - Cool, cool, don't get lost. Ooh, nice ass. I can't wait to hear all the new developments. - Hey boys, what can I get you? (laughter) (coughing) (groaning) (exclaiming) - I don't know, Martin buy your ticket. - I got to get the fuck out of Chicago. It's not what it used to be. (laughs) These fucking blacks, no I'm sorry, you can't use your fucking Link card here. And the fucking chinks with their slanty eyes, they can't see the road, they can't fucking drive. And these goddamn fucking Mexicans. - Purto Ricans. - Puerto Rican, can't get a fucking job, get out of the country, whatever. - [Guy On The Left] I'm getting waxed tomorrow. - I think Halloween is when your gonna get that kitty waxed. (laughter) - It's like I always say, just give a guy alcohol, seriously, just let him talk. It's amazing what comes out their mouths. One time I was. - Hey, there you are. I didn't know what to get you, so. - No, it's fine, I really don't want anything. (upbeat music) - You okay. - Yeah. - Well, you know what they say, if all else fails, drink. - Listen, I don't mean to be a buzzkill but this really isn't my scene, - Okay, then let's go somewhere else. - No, it's fine. - Diego, I really just want to hang out with you. We can go almost anywhere you want. - Anywhere? - Yeah, look around, the night is young. - Okay, then let's go. - Okay. Hey, let's go. - Excuse me, where are you two going? - I don't know but. - You two have fun. - Yeah, wrap it up Stella. - Goodbye Felicia. - Who's Felicia? Exactly, goodbye. - Hey, hey excuse me, who do I have to blow to get a drink down here huh? Is it you, you little sweaty ball man? - So I tell her, baby, you are so beautiful. but I'd rather date your brother. (laughter) Well, well, well, look what the cat dragged in. Better yet, out huh? - Please give me the strength to tolerate this bitch. - Yeah, what got into you huh? - Oh, that's right, you need to make a good impression, carry on. - All right, Abel this is my friend Braulio. - Best friend get it together Diego. Notice that emphasis of the word best. - Okay, the point is taken. - Okay, these are my boys. - They're not important. Okay, so what we need to do is take shots before the show. (talking) - All right here we go, you ready? (laughs) (speaking foreign language) - Ooh, okay, one more please, one more please, here we go. Yes, here we go. Here we go. - Here we go, here we go, here we go. - Yes, there we go, all right again one more. all right, I love you guys, here we go. - [All] Cheers. - That was so good. - Alright, you're gonna love these guys that are playing indoors. - I think I'm drunk. - I swear you're gonna love 'em. I can't wait. (upbeat music) (laughter) (rock song playing) - Fucking love this song, my favorite song. Come on. We got to go downstairs. - No, no, no. - We got to go downstairs. Please, please, please. Come on, come on. Let's go. No wait, wait, wait, you ready? - What? What are you doing? - You got to do it too. - No. - You have to do it, Abel, Abe, come on. - Oh, my God. (rock music playing) (singing in foreign language) (rock music playing) (singing in foreign language) (cheers) - Okay, okay, okay, okay. so, I think that Boys Town is like this giant, no huge fucking supercomputer and there's like little chips that are in all the guys' heads, and all those people and - Me? - Them. I'm sorry that stuff just gets me really riled up. You're tired, thanks for bringing me home. - I don't want to leave yet. - Well then don't, it's a long ride home anyway. - I'm not staying with you mom. - You're not gonna be staying with my mom, don't worry I have the entire basement to myself, she won't even know you're here. - Your basement what if you try to take advantage of me? - Don't flatter yourself. Just stay, it's safer and nothing's gonna happen. - I don't know. - Abel, you got a great personality, and you're adorable as fuck, but you really gotta just learn to get over yourself. (soft music) Abel. (soft music) (moaning) - Diego, Diego. Diego. - Hey. - Are you fucking kidding me? - What? - You said she wouldn't come down here. - It's fine. - I got to go, I got to go, I got to run. - Abel please, come on. (laughs) It's really not that big of a deal. - Yes it is, your mom just walked in on us, I feel like I'm in high school. (laughs) Okay, Abel you really need to calm down. Besides you can't leave now, it'll just make it worse. - What the fuck am I supposed to do? - Eat. Besides, she makes a really great breakfast, you'll really enjoy it. Come on you look great. (foreign language music playing) - [Abel] Thanks. - [Diego] That wasn't too bad right? - Diego you're something else you know that? - I am, I'm sorry. - I'm the one that should be apologizing, flipping out like that. - Did I move too fast? - It's meant to be, it's meant to be, simple as that. - Cool. So what you're going home? - Yeah, yeah, get ready for work tomorrow. You? - The same. Hey, I don't want this to sound too forward but I'd like to see you again real soon. Hey, you always got a place to stay if you're ever in my neck of the woods. - I'd like that, why don't we plan something? How about dinner and a movie? The Pride Parade's coming up we could head on over there Stephen's gonna be there, and you can invite Braulio too, it would be good for those two divas to meet. It'd definitely be very entertaining for us. - Yeah, I think I'll pass on the parade. - Why? - Take me someplace, no? I'll tell you all about it when they get there. - Sure. - Just, let me get out of this. (laughter) Okay. - Can't go with this. - Alright. (laughter) (upbeat music) - So, since I'm learning so much about you today, why do you skip the Pride Parade? - Oh, damn he didn't forget. - No, it's one of the many questions I thought of on our drive here. - I just haven't been in years. - Meaning? - It's lost its magic, Braulio who begs me to go every single year but, the parade's just like all the others, it's about product placements and political agendas, and so I just stopped going. That rainbow flag it doesn't stand for what it's supposed to. We're not going to be a part of their world unless we assimilate, and even then there's problems. It's not what it looks like in the media, it's just really well hidden. Sorry, I'm rambling again. - No, keep going, I'm intrigued. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You want me to really intrigue you? (laughs) - Hey, what, you shy? - You're trying to kiss me with thousands of people traveling by land and water, they might be watching. - Yeah, but we're just a little speck in this world, at least between here and Indiana. (laughter) Hey, do you wanna go someplace different? If you don't like it you can just leave me there, it's fine, it's right by my house. - Don't be, dumb I'm not gonna leave you somewhere, besides I like trying new things. - Good, there's someone I want you to meet. - Who, is this some other family member you've been hiding who's going to pop out at our most vulnerable moment? - No. It's someone that's been by my side for a long time. - Please tell me that you're not seeing someone. - Technically, yes, but don't worry he's more of a mentor. I think he'd really like to meet you, besides if you want to continue this any further, it'd probably be better for you guys to meet. - Okay. - I can't wait for you to meet him. - Him? Okay. What do we do until then? - I don't know, let's see. (alarm going off) - [DJ David] 25% lower in 2014. (sigh) What was that you sound worried? - Of course I am, I don't know if you guys heard about the whole tracking devices that some mothers that cross the borders with their children are being forced to wear tracking devices, I'm not sure if they're bracelets or how they're gonna be tracking them, I don't know if they're gonna put a GPS up where the sun don't shine, I don't know, but you have to worry because of course they want them to show up to their immigration hearing, but you have to wear a tracking device in the U.S.? - [DJ David] Especially when they arrest you at home. - [DJ Maria] Right, the home arrests. House arrest, what's it called? - [DJ David] You wear that on your ankle. - [DJ Maria] Right, well when you're married you wear it on your finger, but. (laughs) (bells tolling) (heavenly music) - Now what? - We reflect. - Hmm? I thought you wanted me to meet someone? - Abel, meet Saint Jude. (heavenly music) - What about everything you talked about, remember? Organized religion and all that. - Just because I don't agree with the church doesn't mean I can't come here and reflect. And besides, this is one of the only known places where I can just sit back, and kick the crap with old Saint Jude up there. (laughter) He's one hell of a listener, his answers come to fruition. And he's Jesus' cousin. He's also the patron saint of hope and lost causes. He made a profound difference in many people's lives. Then he was clubbed to death. Abel, I want there to be honesty between us. - Of course. - Good. - [Priest] Excuse me gentlemen, I don't mean to rush you, but we're about to close. - Thank you. (upbeat music) - So, this boyfriend, he smart? - Rita, did you come here to gossip, or to meet him? - Well, I didn't come up here for your sparkling personality. Come on I just want to know more. I just want to make sure he's good enough for you. - I can tell you that he works on cars, that's a plus. - Well, why didn't you say that in the first place? So you guys been hanging out everyday? - Not everyday. - Don't be embarrassed, being your big sister I just want to make sure you happy. - I always thought of you as an abuela figure. - (speaking foreign language) Abel. - Mother figure, and as a mother and me being your son, I'm bringing him home because I want you to get to know him too, just be sure to grill him after dinner. (doorbell) - Here we go. Hi you must be Diego, I'm Rita, Abel has told me so much about you. - [Diego] It's so great to meet you. - [Rita] Come on in. - [Diego] Thanks. - [Abel] I got it. - [Diego] No, let me help please. I think she liked you. - I really liked her. - Good. (soft music) - It looks like you've been everywhere. - I take it you've never left the country? (soft music) No matter what, it can get pretty lonely, especially when you don't have anybody to share it with. (soft music) - Doesn't seem to stop you. - My parents worked hard to leave me something. I have to live for them too. Try and see much more. - Do you think about them a lot. - Yeah. I remember the last time that I saw them. I was five, and they were rushing around to get ready for a party. My mom came into the living room and leaned in and kissed me, and all my dad said was Rosa, where are the keys? She pointed to where they were, and I remember seeing the back of her head. I wanted to lift my arms up and hug her but they were running late, they never came back. Before I knew it I was in the hospital and my dad was already dead, my mom told me how much they loved me, she leaned in and kissed me and then she did the strangest thing, she sat up in the bed called the nurses and told them she was ready to leave because my dad was coming to take her home. The nurses just disregarded it and I went home with my grandmother and, a few hours later she passed away in her sleep. I may have overdone it with the wine.

Diego is still in the bathroom? - [Stephen] What else is he gonna use? - [Abel] Stupid. - What the fuck? - Do you know how to skate? - A little. - Do you want me to teach you? It's actually pretty easy. - Are you kidding me? Of course I know how to skate that's the dumbest question I've ever heard in my life. Then again, it is coming from you. - [Diego] This is a crazy idea. - I know, you're gonna be great, you already got the hang of it. You ready? - Yeah. - Let's go. (laughter) - Okay, I'm going, hey I can do this. - [Abel] You're doing it, told you. - So come on, go forward, you'll survive I mean the worst thing that can happen is you fall down and break a hip or something. - What? - [Stephen] You'll be fine, come on let's roll. - Do not drop me. And only the hips. - Good, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, alright, here we go. - They're fast. - Left right, push off with your left, drive with your right. - Holy shit. - Left right. - Holy shit I'm doing it. - There you go. - It's like a movie. - Yeah, yeah. - I'm like Leonardo Dicaprio, I'm Leo, I'm flying Jack, I'm! (groaning) - Looks like we don't have to worry about a medical emergency. - Just like that some stars fall. - So much for that huh? - You okay? - You guys okay? Looks like you guys had a pretty heavy fall, you guys need some help getting up? Hey, well if you need any pointers just let me know, okay? - [Both] He's mine, what? - [Stephen] Sucker. - No, I saw him first. ("Frosty The Snowman" instrumental) - Well, did you like your cake? - I love my cake. Man Abel, you really did a lot for this one. - What do you mean? - I haven't had a surprise birthday party in so long, let alone at a roller rink. - It's a first time for everything. - Yeah. - You're getting good. - I'm trying. - Makes your booty look nice. You're gonna fall. - Oh, shouldn't knock me off kilter like that. - Too much of a compliment. - You want to race? - Yeah, let's go. - I'm gonna beat you. (speaking foreign language) I'm gonna beat you, let's go. (upbeat music) (crying) Abel, Abel please. Let me explain. - Your mother is dying in Mexico, I don't understand, I thought Lily was your mom? - She's not, Lily, she's not my mother. - Just help me understand. - My real mother is in Mexico, she's been there since I was six years old. She went back when her mom got sick and I was left here with Lily, and she never came back, that's why I chose to never speak to her. If I could just go back. - Then do it, you'll regret it if you don't. - It's not that simple. If I go back, I can't come back here. - You're undocumented? How the fuck did you forget to tell me something as important as that? - I don't know, you just get so used to keeping it in. - No, I don't understand Diego. I have told you everything about me. - I was embarrassed, I thought you would want to leave me. Look Abel I'm sorry there's nothing I can do to justify my actions, I wanted to tell you, but every time I saw you I just couldn't bring myself to do it, I just didn't want you to think. - What? - That I wasn't good enough. - What are you thinking? - [DJ David] U.S. immigration of Customs Enforcement Unit and Homeland Security, - [DJ Maria] Of course known as ICE. - [DJ David] Will target in deport hundreds of families who have ignored court orders to be leave the United States. (groans) What was that you, sound worried? - [DJ Maria] Of course I am. - [DJ David] Yeah, but you were born and raised here. - [DJ Maria] Yeah but I'm brown. - [DJ David] We can put bleach on you. - [DJ Maria] It don't matter how much bleach you put in my hair. - [DJ David] Ooh, not blonde. - [DJ Maria] I'm still brown. This concerns me because they can really get out of hand, you know that whole profiling thing? - [DJ David] Yeah, but the deportations are gonna be targeted meaning people that have a history of violence, or gang members, or some type of criminal activity. - [DJ Maria] Well, we'll see, right now I need a little pick me up. - [DJ David] Let's use music as therapy. - [DJ Maria] Play that funky music white boy. (laughter) - [Abel] I'm going with you. - [Diego] Abel. - No, I'm buying our tickets end of story. - But how will I get back? - Stop thinking about that already, how come we keep going back and forth with this all week, we'll figure it out, the important thing right now is your mom. - But that doesn't matter. - If you're concerned about the money, don't worry you can pay me back. - You can not pay for this. - We are in this together! - So when do you guys get back from Mexico? - In a couple of weeks. - Lucky. What's this? - Just promise not to open it until I get back. - Abel? - [Abel] Just promise me. - I know everything's gonna work out it has to right? - Just do me one favor. - Yeah? - Make sure that light a candle for us. - Yeah, you know I will. Even though your flames are brighter than ever. (laughs) - Abel, dreams are like a drive in movie theater, you dream and then there's an intermission and you're back to the dream. This is just your intermission, okay, you can be back to dream in no time. I got a surprise for you. - What? - But you got to close your eyes. - What? - Close your eyes. - Paper? - [Stephen] Alright, open it. I had the kids draw it for you. (crying) (speaking foreign language) - I know you're scared. I was scared too. When they closed the mills, and then I got the job cleaning houses, and then I was scared and it wasn't making enough. And then I got the manager job, and look at me. Life is what you make of it, and I know everything's gonna be okay. (crying) (speaking foreign language) (announcer over intercom) - [Diego] Abel this is my sister Carolina. (upbeat music) - So what's the deal with you two? Did you guys call Tia Lily already, does she know that you guys got here safe? - Yeah. As soon as we landed, she stayed by the phone just making sure we got here. - Here. Mama always carried that with her. Get some rest. We go to the cemetery in the morning. Have a good night. (crying) - Rita, yeah, the hotel is amazing, and the beaches are crazy. White sand beaches. We're gonna head out in a few minutes, so I'll call you later on in the week, okay? Okay. I love you too. (dramatic music) (crying) (dramatic music) - No, let him grieve (crying) Guys, there's nothing we can do. Look, I know that sounds harsh, but Diego know that she loves you and she will always watch over you every moment of your life, remember that. - No, I need to say my peace. She's right. - Ain't I always? Come on, let's go down to the feria, it will make you feel better, and besides I think we all could use a little (speaking foreign language). (upbeat music) (singing in foreign language) (chatter) (talking) He doesn't know how to say rah, rah, rah. He doesn't know. - Then teach me. - Oh my gosh, anyway. Salude. (laughter) - Excuse me I'm just gonna go to the restroom. - Do you want me to tell you a secret? - I do. - [Carolina] Are you ready? - I'm ready. - There are only two people in the world that'll tell you the truth. Children and drunks. (laughter) Did I scare you? - You did. - I did. (laughter) Are you ready for me to lay it down on you? - Mm hmm. - Good, 'cause I'm gonna lay it down on you like you have never been laid before. (laughter) So you and my brother are - Say what you want to say. - You're gonna stick around, you're gonna leave what? I mean 'cause you know, I mean I don't know how he's gonna get back. - We haven't talked about it but we're going back together. - It's probably something you should talk about. - [Abel] I know. - That's really sweet Abe. You think love conquers all don't you? - [Abel] I do, yeah. - Well it doesn't, if you hurt him, you will hurt me and I will hurt you. - I don't need your threats to be good to him. - Good, I'm glad we can agree on something. Cheers. - Cheers. - You know I'm just fucking with you right? (laughter) - Hey what'd I miss? - I was just fucking with you. (mariachi music) - [Abel] Explain it to me. - It's kind of tradition here, so all the small towns to do these feria things, well do you see the shape of the garden? - Yeah. - [Carolina] So, all the men walk on the outer part and the women walk on the inner part. - Okay, I get that. - Well congratulations smart ass you're really not as dumb as you look. (laughter) Anyway, it's like a mating ritual for these rancheros and then when they see the girl they like you offer her a rose, and then you take her on a walk around the plaza with you. - Wow, it's a pretty romantic tradition. - Oh, I guess it's cute, I mean it's not my sort of thing though. You know what I mean? (bells tolling) - I think it's gonna be fine, right? - It's gonna be fine, everything's gonna be fine. Yeah, yeah. - They fight each other you know that? - They what? - Bam, fights. - Who fights each other? The horses don't fight. - You just wait. (announcer speaking in a foreign language) (cheers) (applause) (applause) (cheers) - [Carolina] Drink this, here. - Really? - What? Next to (speaking foreign language) 7-up is the miracle cure for everything. You should know that. Don't worry Abe, you'll be good as new in the morning. Now get some rest both of you, we have been partying like crazy since you got here, we're gonna keep doing it until you leave. - I think we've had enough, besides I wanna take Abel up to El Santaurio tomorrow. Oh, (speaking foreign language) what time are we leaving? - I kinda want to just take him. - Oh, alone time. (laughs) I get it (speaking foreign language) I got to take care of some business in the morning. (laughs) Have a good night. (sighs) (bells tolling) - It's a shame Carolina didn't come up here. - It's not like she hasn't been up here before, besides I need some alone time with you. - Awe. What's with the long face? - Abel we need to talk heading back to Chicago. - Really, when do we leave? - Not we, you. Don't you remember I can't go back, at least now. - I'm not leaving without you. - Don't start, besides I've got a plan. - How do you plan on going back if you can't fly? - I got someone who's handling it. - You're not going alone, I'm going with you end of story. - Don't you hear horror stories about people crossing, real horror stories? - It doesn't matter we got here together, we are going home together. - No, we are not. - Diego you can't be worrying about the future and forgetting to live in the moment, life is too precious not to enjoy it to the fullest. When somebody cares about you and wants to give you something, you take it, you appreciate it. - Look Abel, I know you mean well but I don't need you to give me shit right now okay? - Can't you see I'm willing to run the same risk, you're not alone, I want to take this journey with you. - Just do me this one favor, and don't okay? Look I know that sounds harsh, but I just got a lot going through my mind right now. - I know you're overwhelmed Diego, but I have a say in this too, grab ahold of your dreams and live them with me, don't let them outlive us, Diego are you listening? You want to go at it alone? (sighs) (amusement park music) (town square chatter) - I love you Abel, let's go home. (soft music) (laughs) - Are you scared? - [Diego] Yeah. - Me too. - People die crossing, could be us. - Never say you'll die, as my great grandfather would say (speaking foreign language) (laughter) - I like sleeping 'cause everything you want can happen in your dreams. (bells tolling) (whispering) - [Carolina] It's a long ride. And there will be others there too. And then you'll walk until you get there. (dramatic music) - Nice to meet you, my name is Abel, Abel Rendon. - Nice to meet you, I'm Diego Guerrero. - Okay, that was terrible, I didn't believe you, try again. I'm serious. - Nice to meet you again, I'm Diego Guerrero. (speaking foreign language) - Well Diego, will you walk with me? (soft music) What is it? - We don't belong here. - We don't belong here, we're in this together, remember? - Lock it up, we're already running a day fucking late on this shipment. (speaking foreign language) What the? (chatter) - Looks like another successful day in the land of the free and the home of the brave. - Yeah I guess it's pretty great to live in a land where you celebrate your fallen heroes by eating hamburgers and blowing shit up. - Could be worse. Just be happy that we don't live in a country where we can be executed. - Okay, if you put it that way. - Seriously, Diego you should really learn to put your revolutionary views aside and enjoy life, it's too short. Trust me. It happens all over the world, we can't control it, but it teaches us to try harder. Dance with me. (speaking foreign language) Dance with me. - Here, now? - Is that fear I sense? No, what happened to Mr. Revolutionary? Come on we live in America, like I said land of the free, how about proving that it's really the home of the brave? - May I have this dance? - You may. There's that smile. That's all I wanted. - You just ask so much from me. - Stop it. (laughter) (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) (crying) (speaking foreign language) (crying) (speaking foreign language) (crying) - Shut up old bitch. (speaking foreign language) Turn off that fucking flashlight you faggots. You deaf or something? What? Turn that goddamn flashlight off and you can have your way with her when I'm done. - What the fuck are you doing? - [Abel] I can't, I just can't. - No Abel, Abel, you can't go, no! No, no, no, no, no. - Turn the goddam flashlight off. - It's off, it's off, please. You don't have to do this, you don't have to do this. (crying) (dramatic music) (crying) - See what you did? Now you're fucking next (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) (crying) - Abel, Abel, please, please, hey, hey, hey, no. No. (crying) What the hell? (crying) No. (crying) - I understand, I loved him too I never had kids, I don't know if I did maybe I would have never lived in this building, I would have never had Abel in my life. I would have never had you in my life. Here, when God closes a door, he opens a window. - Thank you Rita. - [Abel] My dearest Diego if you're reading this letter I'm no longer with you, not a day goes by that I'm not thankful that you were brought into my life. I don't want you to be sad, Diego become your dreams, make me proud, and most importantly enjoy life to the fullest. You have full access to my life Diego keep your imagination infinite, it'll pay off in the end. Life is a dream, so dream it well. I love you now and forever, Abel. (crying) - [Diego] My dad used to work here in the steel mills. These walls, they make me feel like he's still here with me. - Like the monument for you and Lily. - You could say that. - I wonder if we'll have that. - What? - History, our friends, our family, us, together. - I hope so. (laughter) Come on, there's more I want to show you. (mariachi music playing) - Amen. - Diego. - [Maria] Hey guys it's Maria Lane your hostess with the most is this evening, and hey did you guys hear what (speaking foreign language) was saying, you know trickster, otherwise known as Trump. I mean come on does he seriously think he's gonna get elected after saying what he said? You know all that stuff about women, all stuff about immigrants. If you missed it, I'm sure you haven't, but let me just remind you okay? This is just a friendly reminder of what Donald Trump has said. - [Trump] They're not sending their best, they're not sending you, they're not sending you, they're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some I assume are good people, but I speak to border guards, and they tell us what we're getting. Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall! - [Audience] Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall! (cheers) - We're here, again. - I can't. - Nope, no, you're doing this, what is it gonna take already? - No matter how much you've all pushed I just can't bring myself to do it. - Diego, it's time, you have to do this. - Six months, we were together only for six months. Do you have any idea how that feels? - Do you have any idea how that feels for all of us? - You can't compare, you weren't there. I didn't do anything to help, I just sat there. - You and everyone in that truck experienced hell, in hell no one acts right. Abel, Abel was different and that's what made him so damn special, especially in a place like that. - Why do I even want to stay, what's the point? - Yo, shut up, okay? I'm trying to get my (speaking foreign language) beauty sleep back there and y'all just acting like y'all are on a telenovela over here. Oh, we're at the DMV, again. Listen, hey, this is your home. You are more American than any of these (speaking foreign language) gringos out here, you understand? Abel has given you a gift. His love, his identity, now look these might seem like some pieces of paper to most, but for you it's much more than that. It's a chance for you will ever get. This is your place to be. - I love him you guys. - Then do this, for him , for you, do it for us homie. (crying) - [Woman] Mr. Rendon, Mr. Rendon, Abel Rendon. - Yeah. - [Woman] Have a seat. Abel please look into the camera. Three, two, one. (dramatic music) - [Man] Mr. Winter, Mr. Rendon. - Thank you. - [Man] Safe driving.
