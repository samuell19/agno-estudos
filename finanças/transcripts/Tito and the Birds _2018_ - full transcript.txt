"I hearken to a dove from other Floods" When I was little, my father told me that the world's biggest problem was fear. He said that fear had become contagious, just like a disease. This is the story of how fear contaminated the world. And this is more or less how it all started. What is this chaos? What is the world turning into? Where are the authorities? My name is Alaor Souza and this is your news channel. That's my mother a few years ago. When my father still lived with us. That's me on the floor next to her. And this is Buiu. He was my nanny's son and we grew up together until we were six. when the accident happened. Well, we'll talk about the accident later. Buiu always had bulging eyes. So I don't know if he was born with the fear disease, or if that's how he was: he had big eyes. Filthy animal! Rufus! Rufus! But my father said that I wouldn't catch fear from Buiu because you don't catch fear from the air or from using the same glass. "You catch fear from ideas," he used to say. This is the last time I'll say it, Rufus. Either these birds go, or you go. On the day of the accident, I saw the secret machine my father was building for the first time. My mother had forbidden me to go near the machine, but on that day, my father finally let me. He said the machine was meant for us to understand the language of birds. Since the dawn of time, birds have been saving men from catastrophes. Owls have warned about earthquakes, crows have warned about fires, and geese about wars. While he was speaking, a pigeon started to sing in a very odd way. He was very surprised, grabbed the pigeon and took it to the machine. My father asked me to help by holding a lever. But I... got scared. After the explosion, my father had to leave the house. He said he had to continue the research in a remote place. When we last spoke, he promised he would come back, and we would stay in touch. Always. How? The birds will help us. Look. This is for you. On that day, I decided that I would never be scared again and that I was going to prove that my dad was right about birds. Attention please. We'll soon begin our inventions contest. I'd like to remind you that this is a qualifying round for the international inventions contest. It'll start in five minutes in the auditorium. Tito! Tito! Where are you, Tito? They are calling the finalists. - This is the men's restroom. - So what? Tito, I know you're there. Why don't you answer? I thought you weren't afraid. I'm not afraid. Where is Buiu? How is he going to get inside the school? Shh, Sarah! - No need to worry, Tito. - Hi, Teo. There's no need to worry. I'm going to win the contest anyway. See you on stage, Tito! - Hi, Buiu. - Did you finish the programming? You're a genius, Buiu! Thank God you came. Sarah, don't let my mom come after me, OK? OK. Got it. - Hi, Rosa. - Hi, Sarah. How are you? I only leave the house for events like these. Have you seen Tito? You can't see him now. He's getting ready for the presentation. The final of our Inventions Contest will begin. Let's go. There are two finalists this year. There's a seat over there. The first finalist is Teo Souza. He'll present his invention, Teo's Coil. Please, Teo. My name is Teo Souza and this is my channel. And for the first time ever, you're now going to see one of the best experiments with new energy in the country and maybe the world. I bet he didn't make it. Teo's Coil. Electrifying, isn't it, folks? And now comes the other finalist. Tito Rufus. Tito will present the Ornithologist Machine. Complicated name, isn't it? Ornithologist? Go, Tito! Well... Many people don't know it, but... birds have saved men from many catastrophes. Men stopped paying attention to what birds say and forgot their language. My presentation is an attempt to try to understand their language again. It can't be! Just like Rufus' machine. Tito! Tito! How could you do this? Make a machine just like your father's? And put everyone at risk! What's going on, Tito? Tito, please stop playing with that filthy animal! - There may be a message from dad. -A message from dad? I don't want to hear this anymore! You're already 10 years old. - What about dad? - What about him? - Don't change the subject. - Won't he ever come back? Tito, you father made that machine explode on you. - Don't you remember? - But... - But what? - It wasn't his fault. - Whose fault was it then? - It was mine. I was scared of helping him. Yours? You were seven years old, Tito. Seven! And Rufus left for God knows where and never came back! He never sent any news. When you grow up, you can go after him. Until then, I'm all you've got, OK? And you're grounded! I work like a dog so I can pay for this school and you get suspended. What a shame, Tito. Suspended from school! - But mom... - No more buts! There'll be no internet for you. No TV, no telephone, no games, nothing! You understand? For a month! I'm very proud of you. Be brave and you'll be a great inventor. I'm sorry. Mommy gets nervous because she worries about you. Sleep well. Mommy loves you. Ever since my father left, I've been having this recurring dream. It's as if I were flying into the past to understand the birds' secret. But I always wake up right before I discover it. "I loved your invention. I want to help you rebuild it. Come to my place with Sarah as soon as your suspension is over. Teo." With life in the big cities becoming more and more risky, what will become of us? How can you leave the house? You barely step outside and you're in danger! Look, my friends, I've been doing this for years and I've never seen anything like it! Where are the authorities? Welcome to the Dome Garden! You'll never be scared again. One of our innovations is a system that paralyzes... It's chaos! This is absurd! You. Yes, you who are watching me at home. What about fear? What about it? Our closest companion at all times. Fear! Fear of leaving the house! Fear of meeting friends! Fear! Fear! Fear! Fear! You also talk to them, kid? I don't understand what they say. Do you? The street pigeons, kid. They're free and rejected, but since the world began, they've been living with men. Free and rejected. Free and rejected. Free and rejected. Free and rejected. Don't forget to smile. People say that children with good teeth are allowed to go anywhere. Security card. - We're Teo's friends. - Security card. - That one can't go inside. - But he's our friend. - Teo invited us. - Nobody gets in without a card. Then we'll leave. If Buiu can't go inside, we won't either. -What do you mean? - Are you sure you don't mind if we go? Follow me. Master Teo is in sector 19. Wait here for Master Teo. I've always been dedicated to people's security. I've now decided to develop a chain of gated communities with state-of-the-art security equipment. Welcome to the Dome Garden. You'll never be scared again. One of our innovations is a system that paralyzes any animal that threatens the community's inhabitants, like rats, pigeons and dangerous human beings. I can't stand it. My dad makes everyone who comes here watch it. Well, I've asked you to come here because I liked your invention, Tito. I even think it was a hit. Do you want us to kick him out? Out! Out! No, stupid. I invited him. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! The Trickster Brothers have lots of energy, but aren't very creative. I need a real inventor. What kind of invention? We're going to rebuild Tito's machine, of course. You copied my machine. You have to help me finish the part with the lights. But that's the most important part. You just have to help me win the international inventions contest, with the best schools in the world. Help you? I don't give a damn about that stupid contest. Well, weren't you in the school contest? The one I won? So what? It doesn't make any difference that you won. - Yes, it does! - No, it doesn't! - It does! - OK, then. So why don't you build your own machine and I'll build mine? Ha, I though you didn't care about contests! You two are pathetic! Dear students, I have some bad news for you. I want to-- - Headmaster? - Yes, dear? Sir, what happened to Ms. Helena? Unfortunately, Ms. Helena has been infected by what is being called the "Outbreak", a disease that has apparently become an epidemic. We've had a few cases here at school, and therefore we decided to cancel classes until the situation gets back to normal. - But headmaster? - Yes, dear. How did she catch this disease? It seems that she saw a man who had Outbreak symptoms and ended up getting infected. Was it because she didn't know the man? - Why wasn't the man arrested? - Arrest him! Sir, I don't want to get sick! I bet Tito's dad knows the cure to it. Right, Tito? - It's a lie. He doesn't have a dad. -How come he doesn't have a dad? - He only has his mom! - Shut up, Rita! What do you know about Tito's life? You shut up! Who are you to talk like that? Quiet! That's better. Now, let's watch a video from a specialist. We still don't know where the epidemic came from. We don't have an antidote or formula for its cure, either. But we've mapped out the different phases of the development of the terroris acutus collectivae, also known as "Outbreak". In the initial phase, the virus attacks the eyes, making them bulge out, and accelerates the blood circulation, making the patient tremble. As time passes, the disease makes the hands and feet go numb and then causes a shortening of the limbs. In the third phase, the victims can no longer close their eyes and their limbs shrink completely. The fourth phase takes place when the infected people take on an oval shape. This is very serious because people become useless. The fifth and final phase, and this is an irreversible stage, when there is no more hope of being cured, people become-- Scientists are still not completely sure, but they suspect that in the last phase the sick people turn into rocks. They become completely still, paralyzed, and lifeless. I wish it were you. -Forever, sir? - Sir, I don't want to turn into a rock! We have absolutely no idea of what is causing the Outbreak, so take all possible precautions. Avoid people who've been infected, avoid extremely dangerous or calm situations. Also avoid being too alarmed or too relaxed. In short, avoid everything! "Buiu, where are you?" Son, I'm glad you're home! It's chaos out there! I went to the doctor to make sure I'm OK. Everybody's talking about this Outbreak! Folks, what's happening to us? - Are you OK? - Are you feeling well? -Can anybody tell me? What's happening? Take these, just in case. Will we let this epidemic beat us? Dad saw this coming... Tito, we're not arguing over your dad again, OK? Where are the authorities? When we need them the most? You know I spent the whole afternoon at the doctor's? There were a lot of people there. He said I have nothing. Nothing. What a let-down, this specialist. Son, I have to work now and I have to concentrate, OK? I can't believe I have to work with all this happening! Attention. The mayor has declared a state of emergency. If you see someone with bulging eyes... like this... be aware that this person is infected. We'll be back with more information on the progress of the Outbreak in the city and the world. How weird... The only birds that go near the infected people are the pigeons. Time to go to bed. OK, mom, I'm just going to take my plate to the kitchen. Where were you? Weren't you online? Come on, let's fix the machine. Doctor, my first question is: are we all going to die? We have to fasten the rods. Pass me that rope, Buiu! Is your arm getting shorter? I think we should focus on the pigeons' singing this time. What do you think? -What happened, mom? - We've lost the Internet connection! Just when the doctor was getting interviewed! Come back, pigeon! Did she see you? The doctor! He's having Outbreak symptoms live on TV! Pigeon, pigeon! "Please, dad, help me!" Go, pigeon! Please, find my dad, quickly! Doctors, it's a pleasure to have you here. Thanks for having us, mayor. The matter is important. You must know Mr. Alaor Souza. He just made a "very" generous investment in the new Outbreak Research Center. Mr. Mayor, it is good that Mr. Alaor Souza is here, because the matter also relates to him. We must prevent, at all cost, the population from panicking. Therefore, it is essential that we show less alarmist news on TV. We should focus our energy on investigating the Outbreak. I fully agree that we should investigate the Outbreak, Doctor. But we all know that the success rate of any cure depends on the alertness among the population. Therefore, news reports must not stop. Ever! But, Mr. Alaor, this is different. Our society is facing serious risks. Nobody has any idea of what is going on. The only research we've found on the matter is from a researcher who is, let's say, eccentric. It's this Dr. Rufus, who disappeared four years ago. May I? Mayor, we need resources to find Dr. Rufus as soon as possible. Don't worry, doctor, I will organize the search for Dr. Rufus... myself. No, no... It'll be chaos! It'll be chaos! Mom... try to relax. It's just a nightmare. Son... Promise me you won't leave the house. The world out there is very dangerous. Buiu is calling for help! "Central Hospital, Quarantine Level 4" Buiu is at the hospital! Sarah, I'm going after Buiu. Mr. Alaor, we found the scientist's island. Excellent! Bring him right away! Do whatever you have to do. The Outbreak is spreading rapidly around the world. Specialists still haven't found the cure to the epidemic... Welcome, Dr. Rufus! I'm a big admirer of your research. I'm afraid I cannot say the same about you. Look, Dr. Rufus, look! Here is the new machine. Is that the design I sent you? Of course, Dr. Rufus. Everything is just as you requested. Dr. Rufus, which machine will save us from the Outbreak? This one or the other one? The other machine is an old project, Mr. Alaor. This one is more modern. This is why I asked you to build it. So, this is the one that will save us. No machine will save us, Mr. Alaor. Get out! Dr. Rufus, I need to ask you outright. Do you have the cure for the Outbreak or not? I don't. What a pity! But I know who does. You do? The pigeons will help us, Mr. Alaor. They will help us. Free and rejected. Always looking at us. How is that possible? Mr. Alaor, Dr. Rufus, is everything alright? - What happened to Dr. Rufus? - Very weird. Dr. Rufus cannot be interrupted. Nobody should enter the lab without my authorization. I'll take this. Tito, this way! I'm glad you came, Sarah! How did you manage to convince your parents? I didn't. I ran away. It's the anti-panic brigade! Come, Sarah! Look, level 4! Buiu is here! But how do we get in? The pipe! Cool. I'll stay here to distract those fools. - You're very brave, Sarah! - I know. Go! Hurry! Buiu! Tito! Tito! Tito! The number you are trying to reach is disconnected or out... Where are you, Tito? - Did you make it? - Yes. I found Buiu. - Where is he? - He's there. - But... - But what? You might catch the Outbreak if you look at Buiu now. Come on. Didn't you say I was brave? Then let me be brave! I want to see Buiu. OK. Close your eyes. But go slowly, and don't get scared. You have to be prepared. You can look now. Sarah... It's all right. We'll fix this. Tito! I knew the pigeons were going to help us! What is it saying? Oh no! Sing, pigeon! Sing! Sing! Sing! This is how the pigeon sang before my dad's machine exploded. Wait! My machine! It can sing with my machine! But it's broken. I know what we can do. I can't believe you convinced me to come. Come on, Tito. Let's go! What's this? It's a ball. You can't play outside. Only at the gym, OK? Master Teo is coming. Hang in there, Buiu. We'll get you out of this. Children! Are you lost in my house? Hi, Mr. Alaor. We're not lost. We came to play with Teo. How come you're still walking around out there, without fear? In fact, we also came to talk to you, sir. To me? I'm honored. We know how to make people recover from the Outbreak. Well, well, well... So these very smart kids have found the cure for the Outbreak. How nice! I will call the TV network right now. Teo, my dear, your little friends are telling me they found the cure for the Outbreak. Tito? Tito is the biggest coward in the world. He'd never be able to do that. I'm not scared! I can't catch the Outbreak. OK, kid, very well. I'll cast you in one of my comedy shows. Now, children, go and play because I have to get back to work. I have to watch TV! - Teo, we need your help. - Help? OK. What do you want from me? We need your machine to make the pigeons sing. If they sing right, people will get better. We saw it happen. And if we prove to your dad that the machine works on Buiu, he can broadcast the cure on TV so everyone can try it! Isn't that amazing? So your machine didn't work after all. And you came to ask me for help. I told you Sarah, he won't help us. He never helps anyone but himself. Stop, both of you! We don't have time for this. Teo, I told Tito you would help. You will help. Do you understand? I understand, but... Where's this Buiu? This is Buiu. Someone contaminated right here in my house! Yuck! Come to my bedroom. It's safer. Look how wonderful. I just needed a small incentive for the Dome Garden sales. Look, Dr. Rufus, look at the sales since the Outbreak started. Mr. Alaor, did you call? I need a file on this boy. We have to be careful. The kid has no fear. Damn pigeon! My name is Teo Souza and this is my channel. You will now watch exclusive coverage of the cure to the Outbreak. Go ahead, Tito! - Can I look now? - Wait. So, can I look or not? You can look. It didn't work anyway. -What went wrong, Tito? - I don't know, Sarah, I don't know. Wait. Wait. I know! I do know! The street pigeons! The street pigeons! That's it! - I don't get it. - He's having a revelation. These are not street pigeons! Of course not. They've always lived in five-star cages. The machine will only work with street pigeons. The free and rejected pigeons. They are the ones that know us. They know how to sing! Free and rejected! Rejected and free! But how are we going to get this thing out of the house? I have an idea. The boy's file, sir. But it's Dr. Rufus's son! You... Did you think it was going to be that easy? Catch him! He can't escape! Yes, sir. I can't believe it. It's just like Dr. Rufus's machine. How can that be? Get that machine! Oh no! Someone must have seen us! Get out of the way! Get out! Get out of the way! Get out! Well done, Sarah! -Where are we going? - We have to find the street pigeons! Pigeons! Tricksters! Tito, how do we brake? There wasn't enough time to install it! Is everyone alive? I am, but we're going to end up getting arrested. We won't be able to participate in the inventions contest. And for the first time in my life, my dad will be mad at me. You call that a problem? The machine has broken again. We won't be able to save anyone. The entire world is getting sick. And my dad... He should be here. But he's not. Pigeon, hey, calm down, pigeon. - This pigeon... - What about it? It's different. My dad must have sent it to help me. Why is there a picture of your dad there? Where? "Outbreak Research..." I think he set up a lab to find a cure for the Outbreak. There may be scientists there much better than your dad. - It's in the old downtown. - There's no way I'm going there. -It's too dangerous. - But the sign is saying it's here. We're in the old downtown! That's it. Let's go talk to the scientists. Actually, this is not so bad. It's kind of charming. OK, I'm in. What about the Tricksters? We have to wait. They must be at a police station, or worse, in a hospital. We have to go. It's our only hope. OK. Just don't leave me here alone. Look! We can go in through there. Well done, pigeon. - But it's too high. - We can do it, Teo. Let's go. Buiu, stay here. We'll pull you up soon. What now? - I'll go first. - Be careful, Tito. I hope my dad's face can take it. Hold on, Tito! I think it stopped. Where's the pigeon? - Did you hurt yourself? - It's OK. Where's everybody? We're lost. Even the scientists have run away. What's this, Tito? We're not lost. This is the ornithologist's machine! The real one! So my dad should be around. But how will I find him? Look! We have to get out of here. They're going to catch Buiu. We have to take the machine. But how? That's it! The pigeons will carry the machine! Are you crazy? They won't manage! You don't know what they are capable of. Yeah, stop being so negative, Teo. - Come on, Teo! - OK. - Look, the Trickster Brothers! - Come down! Come down! Come down now! The pigeons can't carry it. We're going to fall! Look, the hospital. Let's land there. The machine landed in the hospital, roger! Teo! Stop hanging around with those kids. You're the heir of Alaor Souza. Stay away from those kids. Now! You're not giving up now, are you? - But he's my dad. - Come back here, Teo! Go, Tito! Turn the machine on. Attention! This machine is very dangerous! Protect yourselves from danger while you can. The best place to be now is the Dome Garden, away from this chaos, from this mess. - to buy the right house for you. - Dad! Teo! Teo, my boy... - Watch out! - Teo's going to fall! Tito! Tito? Tito? Tito, answer me! The machine broke again. Tito, you scared me! I thought you were dead. Sarah... Your eyes... This wasn't supposed to happen to you, Teo. Come back, my son! Come back! What's this? What's happening to me? - You have to do something, kid! - But you broke the machine. Your dad. Maybe your dad can help. But he isn't here. Dad? - I can't understand him. - Here! The capsule. Doctor! Dad. I'm sorry about all this. Why are you sorry, Tito? The machine, the explosion, your having to leave home. No, Tito, it wasn't your fault. I failed, son. I was trying to find the antidote for the disease and I didn't find the answer. - Not even when I turned into a pigeon. - But, what now? - What are we going to do? Tito, I can't figure out why the pigeons aren't healing us. You need to find out why, Tito. - Quickly. - No! Sarah! Tito... Do you still think I'm brave? Of course, Sarah. Of course. Sarah! No! No! The pigeons! I have to find out why they aren't healing us. When I entered the machine and turned into a pigeon, I finally understood the dream I'd always had. I flew into the past. But the secret there was not only about birds. It was also about fear. For other animals, fear makes them flee or fight. Humans learned to join forces to overcome fear. Together we are stronger, we can wait for the fear to pass and then face what caused it. What my father didn't realize is that humans had forgotten this. But the pigeons, who have lived with us since the beginning of time, still remember. The singing of the pigeons is not the cure. The singing of the pigeons... is a memory we share. Tito! How did you do it? I told the pigeons that we had forgotten how to overcome fear. Then they sang for us to remember. Look! The pigeons are calling the other birds so they can help. Mom! Tito! Wow, is everyone all right? Next time, I'll pay more attention to what you say, dear. I think your eyes are big even without the Outbreak. -I have a foot, a leg, an arm... - I have a neck, a hand, fingers... Attention! The magic song that is the antidote for the Outbreak is already available for download on our website for only US$ 9.99. After all that's happened, I hope people will remember why we had the Outbreak. Otherwise, the Outbreak will happen again soon. And I'm not sure the birds will want to help us again. Just to be safe, I'll keep practicing the language of the birds.
