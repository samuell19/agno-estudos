[Music] Stanley was finished with Eyes Wide Shut and he was exhausted he suffered discomfort and huge tiredness in the last two weeks they were overworked and even for his lack of sleep he had him less sleep I didn't think he looked well at all I was worried about him and I was all set to send him to a doctor to have a checkup and he looked awfully pale he was exhausted which is very much a sign of a bad heart I had a father who died of a heart attack so I assumed if there was anything wrong with him it would be the same symptoms a wrong assumption because most people who have a heart attack are very surprised by it he had a big in fact which is a clot [Music] when I very much hope is that his brain was gone before he had any sensation of suffocation or suffering I console myself would have been so unhappy with a horrible heart that constantly makes him die over and over and over I'm so sad he died so young but we were really very happy for 42 years we were one of the lucky couples [Music] [Applause] [Music] unlike rumors about him that he was a hermit Stanley was the opposite of a recluse first of all he was an immensely curious person he wanted to know everything about everybody - a tactless degree and he would come right out and ask people in this is Stanley you got I just wanna know you know and that could both be insulting and flattering because you know most people are just not that interested in anything as he was recluse that's not true we used to go down into the little town St. Albans and walk around the supermarket it's just that nobody knew what he looked like so he never got bothered when he was doing that work Center was at home so there was nowhere to go to go to work so that was another area of it which people don't understand it wasn't that he didn't go anywhere because you didn't want to go anywhere he didn't need to go anywhere you could be a hermit poet a hermit novelist a hermit gardener but you can't be a hermit filmmaker that's a big misconception about him I mean Stanley was very hilarious and as a film director I mean he was surrounded by people too I mean he loved people talking to be the right people I mean fools didn't last long with Stanley [Music] Stanley was a lot of fun he would invite us to his home for dinners from time to time the most stimulating company and there were people from all walks of life not the face not the film business scientists painters writers and he could hold his own on any level on any subject I mean he was an autodidact I suspect he was amazing I was no more private than myself for anybody that's is not you know a social butterfly but we were invited you know every weekend to go and drink beers and watch a movie with him and talk about anything that very day I met Stanley he invited me over to his house you know in St. Albans for dinner and so I get a chance not only to meet Stanley but the same day to meet Christian and his kids and the entire evening I spent in his house was spent in the kitchen I did a dining room I don't a formal dining room but it was in a kitchen I couldn't believe because I had also heard the Stanley was kind of distant and cool but he was a family man first and foremost and that's the thing that surprised me the most he had his kids and he had his wife obvious there was a very tight family he is very much in love with her you could tell that for sure [Music] I met Stanley because he saw me on television and he wanted to cast me for the girl in Paths of Glory and so I went to his office in Geiselgasteig and there he sat and I was very impressed and so was he [Music] when I got to Munich just before there's a glory it was about Judy Stanley said that he had an idea for her for the end of the movie which was not in the script he explained to me that there's a German woman in the hands of the French would come up on the stage and sing a song and he said and I have just the girl to do the part and it just so happens that we're going out together too and I said oh now I understand what this is about he'd written that scene because he wanted a lyrical ending for the film and Harris accused him of just wanting to sleep with me and sacrificing his artistic purity to that which was not true it really was not true and it's a point of honour for me to mention that I didn't interfere in anything I had already been hired and everything and then it all started and nothing to do with Jim Harris's fantasy of total moral decline I saw the light at some point that if he was he was so right it turned out to be so important as a punctuation for that picture and Stanley went on to marry her which was it wasn't like just a fling or a passing fancy the song I sang in passive glory was my last part and I knew that also from then on I I really he was a control freak I wasn't allowed out of his sight so it was very happy because ever since I met him it seemed to me that all the other people that I knew were really horrendously boring in comparison [Music] Stanley grew up fairly sheltered except he lived in the Bronx so once he was out of the house not so sheltered so he really lived very much New York City life his father gave him a camera and that was it he'd learned to do it properly he did everything in the darkroom he knew everything about lenses he was quite scientific in his approach and really eager to know so by the time he got his first job in Look magazine he was a child really he was just 17 socially totally inadequate to have this job and you ran into endless amount of trouble socially but he made good money and he was very only safe didn't he was very sensible and he also was making money on the side playing chess it was a very good chess player then he was clever enough to realize that what he really wanted to make his films and that he had to give up what had become a very lucrative job by now and saved up money to make his first film and his uncle lend him some money in the whole story it's very hand-knitted the start of his career I sometimes read his old Diaries when he was a very young man and I wish I could show this to film students it would give them courage how difficult it is to make up how nobody wanted to talk to him on the phone I got nothing but rejection after rejection for everything he did and he never gave up and that I believe is the testing ground for most artists this ability to just hang in there because that's what you have to do we finally got married I think it was on the 14th of April in Las Vegas and I had never seen Las Vegas everybody said what his son so sleazy it was brilliant to a young European to go to Las Vegas was AHA everything you know fabulous and then we lived in Los Angeles when I arrived not only was the weather amazing everything was and I went to UCLA I was very grateful to UCLA sort of filling me in on certain things and I studied birth painting and English there the mixture of toddlers and a painter is not very good for your home decoration I knew many women painters whose husband wouldn't allow them to make a mess I messed up every room luckily Stanley was extremely tolerant of all my painting stuff boy did I not fit in our app or had a very patient husband I must say and I made every social mistake possible as you can imagine Jim Harris was forever trying to bring me up to scratch and they taught me horrible things to say in English with great amusement so they they trained me to be an American and then soon we left for England that have been trained to be English so now I'm just a wreck 5060 years ago you could be a celebrity and still be a private person nowadays if you're a celebrity the public feel that they own you and you're expected to go on TV they're your soul your heart you know you become so public property in other words Stanley I guess was a bit old-fashioned in that way and in the sense that he thought well what matters of the film so I mean not what I had for breakfast or my favorite color this is unimportant it's the work that matters it wasn't compass or vein of walking around thinking I'm a genius he were the very opposite the very fact if you care that much about making good films you constantly find yourself inadequate so did he he wasn't a show-off at all and never played the mister film director for one second he did come back from the BBC once and he'd say oh god it was so embarrassing this man you know recognized me in the hallway and I had to give him my autograph and the fact is he liked to live his life slightly differently from other people and could afford to do it and did it but not a lot of people build around lives in that way didn't care to do interviews or to be recognized in the street which is not a criminal offense it's just the way that he liked it that was a great treasure to have that he could be incognito but isn't that the ultimate luxury though being famous for your work and what you do what's important and not have to worry about some lens following you because he wouldn't talk to the press there from the press like to build up some kind of myths about him but it wasn't accurate in the case of Stan Lee he had a very bad relationship always with the UK press but it was only the UK press and the rest of the world it was fine the English press didn't like him because he never talked to them he was so often invited by TV and radio to talk and to be in chat shows if there was anything important to say he would put it in his film and that was the end of it I think he thought of it himself he says I am far better as a filmmaker than I would be as a judge-show guest I would be inferior I would say wrong things I would be nervous he had no faith in himself at all in that and he apologized to Warner Brothers he just said I can't do it forget it I make a fool of myself I felt like at the end of it that what he had created was a kind of Wizard of Oz character what he projected out to the world that brow in those eyes and the focus of making a film that was the way that he wanted the world to see him but then what I discovered as Toto the little dog running and pulling the curtain back was that it was just a kid from the Bronx who was in love with making movies saying he had two things that he was devoted to and he separated his time and and devoted 100% of that separation in each case one was to his work the other to his family it was probably a tough test master for the children because he is the tough taskmaster for his work as well but it's because of her dedication is because of a desire to bring out the best in the movie that he's making or if the children's growing up he was very protective he didn't like going to bed if the cats weren't all home and and he didn't know where we all were and thank God there were no bar phones when we were teenagers oh my god you know where are you so yeah he was extremely protective but also very supportive and certainly if ever you were confused about anything what to study what job to have any of that stuff he would always come up trumps always always always he was problem solver number one he loved his children he loved me and he wanted us to do exactly what he thought was right that felt very bad for his daughters especially during the woman's Lib ere I remember bringing one boy home one time I was about 17 and he had dinner and you know he'd had the look and the questions and I just saw God so we came back and he dropped me off at the door and I was going upstairs and dad pokes his head out of the dining room door and he looks at me says you're kidding right I was just like but I was the first of three girls my sister's got away with murder I sort of cleared the way [Music] a lot of people didn't realize how good his sense of humor was it was very very very funny sense of their world appear as as I said when I would be here at the house and you know he'd be making tea you know he wasn't particularly practical with these things but he was always happy to do you want a cup of coffee Larry you want some toast he'd burn the toast and the tea would get spilt I said I loved that you know see that was part of the attraction for me was more about the personal side and seeing Stanley and laughing we would laugh and he still terrible jokes very funny jokes but some people might find them distasteful but I still find them really funny and I think our sense of humor was a little bit similar so I think that helped of you know our working relationship it was one of the funniest men on the planet he was like a stand-up comedian in many respects even when the chips were down on one or two things it's very rare that you'd had a conversation with him that didn't begin with some kind of a joke and because he had this Brooklyn accent he sounded like a comedian from time to time but his jokes his stories were very funny very funny you know maybe they weren't for everybody but I got I got his humor and I loved it when he was funny he was incredibly funny and if he was feeling a little upset with someone who could be biting me sarcastic we all went through it he was just such a powerful force of nature that's what he was really I think was the first first seen in the shell house at the very beginning of Barry Lyndon and I took the ribbon off from around my neck and hid it down between my breasts and it was when we were doing the close-up and I don't know where he was sitting somewhere over there and he said can you lift the right point up a bit thank you okay just pull in the left one a little bit yeah okay and and the right one again and can you push them both and then the whole studio fella by busy side over gay after the path of glory it was a very uncomfortable time for him because nothing sort of was happening right away and he tried and he didn't want to just make any old film in order to support himself and by now me and the children so when Kirk phoned him and said I want you to do Spartacus he jumped at it he knew that if he got through this film this would be for his career a good thing that he made the film finished it and was now an established film director not somebody who made little independent films unlike Paths of Glory where Kirk was our employee in this particular case Stanley was his employee directing the picture for Kirk Nance then we had never been in this posture before where he had a boss he was very used to pleasing himself having done everything himself so this was a new experience for him to now have to do whatever was put in front of him and I think 90% of the time if not more everything went extremely well he got through the picture the picture turned out great and the experience of working with with with these some of these actors was terrific and Stanley brought a lot to that picture but he felt that he couldn't wait to get on to the kind of filmmaking that we were used to where there's no boss over our heads that we made what we wanted and didn't have to account to anybody they only chose to make movies in the UK rather than in America because he had more freedom there he was away from from the studio structure in Hollywood in the studio system it was a creative choice as well as a physical choice many New Yorkers I think feel trapped in California it felt like being in a boarding school you know all the people you work with you meet at dinner and you meet them in restaurants if you go out and how's it going Stan and and and he didn't like that so after Lolita and then soon we left to England I remember asking Stanley Stanley why did you leave the states why did you leave Hollywood because it was really simple he said I was living in the flats of Beverly Hills I was tired of walking up to people that I knew and shaking hands with them and them saying how are you and knowing that they hope my answer was lousy he said that while he was in Los Angeles people would ask him how are the dailies you know how's the film going along hey say horse great he said that before they turned away he said you could start to see the bitterness on their face the the animosity that they that everyone in Los Angeles seemed to him to be waiting for you to fail and he didn't want to stay in that environment he liked England because like many people read a lot of English Lit they got hooked with certain fantasies about England and found them to be partly true and he liked the weather and he said when I got to England I found that the the crews the technicians were really wonderful at what they did a sound man wasn't trying to direct the film the director of photography wasn't trying to direct the film that the director was the director and they were they were technicians and he loved that so he started making films there and because he was a chess player there he was now eight hours ahead of Los Angeles is that as the time goes when you're playing chess and you make your move you stopped the clock and now you're waiting for the other person to make their move he was eight hours ahead of him it was a great position to find himself in he was a part of the system because he was being financed by the major studios but he wasn't as subject to their directives by being away from it and I think it gave him a real sense of freedom [Music] Stanley recognized when he saw this house that this had endless possibilities this house is actually quite amazing it's very old it's been there pre-roman days because we live above the water of St. Albans there's a river called Ver and the river flows under our house it's always been occupied or wherever there's water there are people so Childwickbury was owned by the church and I believe there were monks here and novices and they kept cattle and it's mentioned in Samuel peeps diaries they fled here during the plague this house is been added onto into a rabbit warren of Victorian and Georgian and down to medieval bits so it's got an amazing history it is a dream house we had some cats run over in our old house and this was very protective to the animals because it's you know quite a distance from the road it was very strange when he moved to the country of the things that are normal to other people he'd never seen a cow close up so it was a splendid education teaching him what couldn't couldn't be done in the country they took it very seriously the whole thing the isolation and the newness of his surroundings were very good it looked like he had the ultimate privacy and so he did he loved living here he never left at all he simply liked working from here and he had the room to do so and keep all his family with him without being disturbed by anybody you can't disturb each other if the walls are thick and old I mean I'm totally aware of how spoiled I am to be able to live here I am [Music] he used to say you know it's easy to fall in love and find a good story which may be true there aren't that many good stories out there watch spot run Jack and Jill went up the hill I mean something like that would have bought Stanley he would want to do something challenging to himself that would also be challenging to the audience I mean otherwise why Paul Stanley struggled with each script he wrote and threw away and he wrote you threw away and he changed and he pulled it back I think it was the writing process of most people filmmakers especially he wasn't just gonna make any movie that came down the pike he wasn't the kind of director you could just send you know a kind of middle of the road in cannon movie script to he had to be a subject that really embraced things that he was interested in and so he worked on the scripts he didn't write them he developed them that was a constant process in between camera setups he was there on the typewriter working and reworking and reworking sometimes we had eight or nine different color-coded pages of changes inside the scene in a day he used to get to the point where he kind of Soho which color are we on now it was just impossible to keep track of it It was one of his great fears not finding a story that it was really interesting really good enough and he dismissed many he probably had three or four things that anyone's on that he was reading and he had a dilemma which one he really wanted to do and they did read something about one but ah yeah but then pick something else I'm I know you know he would do this this was how he was as a person he didn't go out of his way to work that way it just happened he was very depressed and sad that he wasted time doing that it was like yeah falling in love with something and not paying off yeah they did it went through that very often he wanted to do this film on the Holocaust Harry and papers yeah that was a big big project and we had one year of pre-production on it because it's a huge topic and it's a topic close to his heart to something he wanted to do we had already the permission for example in the city of Brno in Czechoslovakia to get the Nazi flags on the houses and get the trams out of the museum in the road and close the city centre we were very much advanced and then Terry Semel and Stanley decided to postpone it because of Schindler's List that was finally his way out oh well it's coming too late you know you can't make two in a row but Schindler's List was a story about somebody who saved a handful of Jews not about the actual killings and as he developed this film he became clear to him he just couldn't do it he had absorbed all this information and at some point he just imploded on knowing this he very much felt that if you show the total truth how would you get an actor to do that how would you get an audience to see that he just can't do it and at that point you're not a filmmaker anymore you your contributor to the ultimate crime of all the torture stories in the world so in a way it was unhappy but he was happy that that was his official remark about stopping that film just coincidence is just shows you you know two minds with a single thought they were all good filmmakers and had the same interest in no subjects the Napoleon thing he was a sadist about he would have liked have made that Stanley was interested in this figure because there was such a brilliant person who was also so foolish at the same time that interested Stanley this mix of huge talent huge charisma and utter foolishness he thought the history of Napoleon was the most interesting thing he had ever read and he was immensely well-educated he spoke about it very well he was very thoughtful would have been a brilliant film I remember one of the visits that I had with Stanley was it is called when he was working on Napoleon and I remember he invited me into this work room huge room and there was an aerial shot of a possible location for a battle scene and he had a grid over this thing very detailed grid and this covered the wall he was counting the figures in each of these little squares that made up the grid he had an eye for extreme detail MGM got cold feet and pulled out because there was a project Dino De Laurentiis making a film as Rod Steiger Waterloo that was the title of the other film was just one particular episode of Napoleon it was his end really while that notwithstanding interested in at all it was a total flop and so the studio told Stanley Americans don't like films where people write with feathers [Music] Stanley's always told me when he was prepping but casting is like maybe 80% of your film in terms of whether it's gonna be good or not great directors cast very well and if you cast very well you don't have to do a lot I've always found that the most successful things that I've done in my life both in theatre and film have been when I suspect that I've been cast well said you picked the right actors that can contribute something that are intelligent but they know their lines that prepared their professional and when they come onto the picture they're going to make it better so casting is so important and you notice in off Stanley's pictures the acting is impeccable he called me in to meet with him because he had a project now at first I misunderstood my agent I thought it was Stanley Kramer a very different animal I was shooting a movie at Elstree Studios so I was very close to where he lived and I just popped in to see him and we went into a tiny little office and I said well what is it he goes and then he of course realized he was gonna have to tell me if he's gonna give me the book he said have you ever heard of it no it no he went you haven't like it was some big thing you know I said no I've never orange no I have no idea what it is he said oh it's a huge cult book and I went well not in Notting Hill Gate it's not I think it started that Stanley Kubrick was sending me a script I said who really am I dreaming and he had sent me a script and all the names were changed because he didn't want anyone to get wind of what he was working on next in elaborate the story of the 18th century with lots of duels and love affairs what could he imagine of the 18th century and I flew to London to the Dorchester Hotel where Mr. Stanley Kubrick would be waiting for me in the restaurant and I found him from the beginning dynamic extremely attractive beautiful eyes look right through you look beyond you framing always framing a scene Leon Vitali was an incredible young actor one of the best in England when Stan they asked him to come play Lord Bullington in Barry London he and they only got on when they were making the movie and Leon showed an interest in filmmaking and when Stanley was looking for an assistant Leon stepped right up and right into that other role you know he was responsible for a good deal if not all of Stanley's casting on the rest of the movies like The Shining Full Metal Jacket and Eyes Wide Shot I got a book it sent to me through the post and it was a shiny and little yellow sticker on the front saying read it that was Stanley anyway and the next night he rang me he didn't even say hi Stanley or anything he said do you read it I think yeah I read it he said do you want to go to America and find a little boy I said yeah okay of course and we went on from there with the shining you know I saw 4,000 boys over period of six months in America with Eyes Wide Shut you know for the role of the receptionist in the hotel where he goes to find Nick nightingale the role that Alan Cumming played actually I saw 80 actors that one please just one scenes I'm casting with Full Metal Jacket now went on all the way through the movie I mean the aim was always to get the cast together before we started but we never managed to do it I was doing theater in New York and Modine and I had met at an audition and we went together in Central Park and learned our dialogue together he was passing by the Ritz one night and because he hadn't been around for a while custom where he was and he said he was preparing to do a movie with Stanley Kubrick and that there was a part available and that I should send a tape and a couple of weeks later Stanley Kubrick called me on the phone Stanley was the first person really to do any kind of auditioning on video in England and what was beautifully refreshing about that was it wasn't about walking in a meeting a producer or director in a room with a 10 by 8 this was a thing where you give him text up front and you had to learn it and then you audition it from the a video camera with a costume director and it was just great because what you felt was that I've shown what I can do one of the things we never did was say well this character is you know physically like this or psychologically like and it was all about letting in as many people into the process of auditioning for it and seeing exactly what they could give you they might give you an extra dimension to what ever you had in the back of your mind which was always a wonderful surprise when they did what I remember about him outside of him the director what really impressed me I think the most was Stanley Kubrick the producer he was such a parsimonious producer that he watched the costs I mean really really he was on top of it and that's a good lesson to learn actually because a lot of it is complete waste a lot of what we do you know in terms of getting the money on the screen Sammy was brilliant at getting the money on the screen [Music] good other directors the problem they have is they have a producer looking over their shoulder that producers the money guy because there has to be some sort of control then we've got a certain amount of money and here's the project it's all mapped out exactly where this money goes and how much goes free of the scene and how many minutes the scenes going to blast family doesn't have that he doesn't have that producer looking right over his shoulder Stanley had freedom he wouldn't even allow a Warner Brothers representative to come on his set while we were filming period I remember my first day on set I wanted to meet Stanley Kubrick the guy who had just hired me for a film you know and they said well you'll have time I go where they shooting they're shooting over there that bunch of people over that's where they're shooting I said well that's where I'm going so he walks me over right and as we're walking over there's this van and it's full of these people sitting in it I knew that it wasn't part of the movie it was very odd though because this is sitting there and we get there and I introduced and Stanley shakes my hand and he goes sit down we're gonna do a thing where they marched through this alley and so they shoot it and then they shoot it again and they shoot it again and I'm watching this man over there as people are just sitting in the van I said who are the people in the van and Stanley leaned oh man he said those are the Warner brother executives they're not allowed to get out that dilemma of director-producer with that amount of control that he had you can imagine these conversations going on I'd really like to shoot a bit more on this but it's gonna cost this and I can't justify that even though he could say I'll spend this he wouldn't just do it you know without any good reason I'm sure he analyzed everything in that way he was totally entrusted with his budget with his money was that nobody interfered Warner Brothers trusted him Terry Semel said look I mean either you have this guy you don't yeah is no point in interfering they trusted him and he knew that I was supposed to be there for two weeks and I was there for two months it sounds so expensive when you think about it now how did he keep a production going on for that amount of time how did all these things happen but people don't realize that he worked with his family so much and by working with his family he was able to keep things really secretive and really small and there's nothing more beautiful than working in a family business the very first time I became involved with the business was after I had finished school I was 17 and I became the video operator on Full Metal Jacket everything that the camera films is also recorded on video so that the director can see a playback of the and I was in charge of just making sure everything was recorded that could be played back and that I did but it was interesting because Stanley relied on the video playback quite extensively to look at the take back with the actors and I was there spooling back and then pressing play and I would overhear in his conversations with the actors and his thoughts so it was a good place to be when you are on his set it's you know really lovely you don't realize that the catering company is like hit the little kid on the truck as his grandson and it's run by his son-in-law and that his daughter is in the office my least favorite job was xeroxing scripts because it would give me 20 copies of that and he would always preface it but you got five minutes because if you walk past you know and you weren't actually doing anything it'll take you five minutes no I won't was one time I can't remember what I was printing and he kept sending me back saying I can't read it and it wasn't until sometime after we realized actually he needed glasses that's why he couldn't read it cause his arms weren't long enough all right should we try this Doug okay let's go the best players whether it's in sports or even in making films make it look easy the real good ones so watching Stanley it really looked easy because she was so good and he always could articulate what he wanted he gained the respect of his actors and and things just flowed the impression as a director it was the opposite to what my preconception of what a director would do which is the idea of being this race of commandeering domineering shouting tyrannical character he was name was there it's never like that he was just really quiet and he was really friendly with everyone that's the point my very first note from him was a very discrete you know how some directors say oh for God's sake do you know that he didn't do that he said they're gonna talk to your mom and he took me aside and he said just to tell you um we know that she's a little flirt so you can play her as smoothly as you like I've thought of that note so often since in things I've done because it's a perfect obviously you don't have to act it the audience know his directions were nothing eccentric about his directions I mean we're they were as straightforward as Matthew you're not gonna do it that way are you or one that he'd said there's a marching into combat was pulling the beard down looking at me coming over whispering in my ear look really scared my entire experience with him he he was like the nicest most considerate director you know the entire time even like super protective actually I was like a little kid but I had to ask him if I could take a break in the middle to shoot another movie I was really scared and everybody would get like really quiet as if like the president was coming into the room and this guy came in and he was just couldn't have been sweeter I had eyes that were so twinkling he was just lovable and it made me feel super comfortable there was a really great experience people say he wasn't didn't come forward with things but when he was saying goodbye to me he said he said you a really lovely actress and I wish there were more but there's no more in the story I mean so lovely things like that I was worried because we were getting further and further behind schedule what I felt because of one's ego you think I'm responsible and not considering what problems he was faced with so I thought jeez you know when am I not giving him what am I not doing how do I play this character I don't know what I'm doing and he was what's the matter you know and I said I don't know and he's what's wrong you you know you're obviously you're upset about something and I said well Stanley I don't know what what to do I don't know how to play this part I know I don't know what I'm doing wrong what do you need from me and he he shook his head and he said I don't I don't want you to play anything all I want you to do is be yourself I mark that down in my diary because I know the important part of that sentence was to be yourself it's a very legitimate thing that Stanley did there was no nonsense none he goes do you know what you're gonna do tomorrow tomorrow was the bathroom scene and I said yeah I think so and he said okay it has to be big it has to be long Cheney big do you understand what I mean and I said yeah I understand sir me okay see you tomorrow morning so I incorporated what I had in mind and we went in and we did the dialogue and two takes and then he asked me to come and sit with him after it because he was he would watch playback and he put his hand on my hand and he squeezed my hand a little bit during one of the takes and he has that is incredible work he goes that is incredible I always kind of took it as you know thanks for doing the right thing for me you know like I trusted you to come here and do this and thanks for showing up you know it was kind nice that he did that Stanley tended to stick with a crew he knew wherever possible and also stand his reputation preceded him so you knew what you were in for he expected a lot out of you but I mean he expected even more out of himself so he wasn't how these directors who sort of Ponce's about and says oh can you go and do that and then gives you a BA looking for not doing it properly he led by example he didn't want to rush he for him it was absolutely essential that there was no pressure when it really comes to to film that's the moment when you don't want to have any pressure you can have it in pre-production that's fine yeah but not when it comes to turning over take your time and the actors liked it there's no doubt about it I just know that I had turned myself over to him that he was my general and that I wouldn't be saying to him listen are we gonna be done soon all these stories about him doing hundred takes of everything are so not true it depended on the moment when it was necessary 200 takes he would but most of the time he sometimes took hardly and it takes it all he didn't do that many takes on Clockwork but I heard that later the legend he went over a hundred and all this I think that you know Stanley got it in his head he was a man of theories and unless they could be disproved quickly you could be in a little awful lot of trouble and the theory was the more takes you do the more resistance you break down in the actor that you're likely to get something fantastic around a hundred 120 takes I think I got 250 in one take because it was very technical thing and I just said to him Stanley could we go back to 1a because say here take 50 is so it just so takes the air out of it and he look to him anyway no that was it I won okay excuse me for asking could you stand the way you do with your gun or simulate the gun he'd walk around with a viewfinder and just keep putting different lenses on and you'd run through it once you'd run through it twice he'd run through it a hundred times if necessary until he found his first shot when he was directing you and when you were doing those multiple takes he was looking for something you knew when he'd got it there was a kind of an excitement from him that you felt and you saw in his face as soon as the tape that he was really happy with there was already an image he had in his head and he would go and till he got that image known that dance field we danced which we knew inside out because we done it for do you do it three weeks he'd say lovely let's go again and so take 1 take 2 take 3 I have never done and as many takes on anything and when you thought it was good and you thought that was a good one lowly go again Oh could you be one thing he would just say do it again let's do it again and I said what I should do it differently right if you want me to do it again I dunno he said no just like that just like that and yet you want another one he said yeah I said that your 16th just like that he set up Peter Sellers he said he will give you 50 takes of 49 are not usable and in the 50th it can't be repeated it's so good and if you remember Peter in some of Stanley's movies he's pretty breathtaking he'd kind of started to just lose this idea of acting you were just being he was just waiting for you to drop all those add-ons as you do as an actor those little touches you think meet the performance he just wanted you to be and so by the end of it and it wasn't his pretension of a great acting performance and you were in the moment simply because you've done it so many times there was one actor that did I think two days worth of takes on one line that never made it in the movie we're about 50 yards looking through this broken wall it was a hole and all these flames coming from these gas pipes and cameras earning them we're outside the building were sitting at the monitors watching this scene and he had his megaphone and he would click the thing and go and in the megaphone like wow like that and he'd say yeah well it's take 66 that was absolutely not good at all and we're going again I was there in England and Ireland for almost a year and a half and at times I didn't think it would ever end when Stanley turns the camera from here to here we got a relighting job ahead of us okay now the actors can go away and rehearse when when they call us back in then it's an Lea has to relight the scene it's his baby but there was a rhythm to it and you found the rhythm Stanley's approach was very very simple he wanted to test everything [Music] yeah and use a really great expression he looks under every stone and then he looks again the fault that he had gone away from something without knowing he's done every single possible thing to make it as good as it can be and that was the kind of conversations that I used to have with Stanley but Stanley we had this and that looked great and we liked it when we saw the tests in he couldn't always explain that but it was something in him that he just wasn't comfortable with it you wanted to explore something else he lights for a long time and then he decides he's not happy with it and you go home and you come back the next day and you try again so there was maybe three or four pages in this scene Marie Richardson and Tom Cruise - the first few pages and I come in at the end of this one this first scene that I mean I thought you know it'll be a few days but it was more than a few days so I got to the set to start to shoot my entrance into that scene and he said I'm gonna I don't really like what I'm how I've kind of got you guys lived so I'll see you tomorrow I was like I'm so close to actually shooting a frame of footage but we didn't do it until the next day he was trying things out he made had little models of things and he was lighting them and he would travel with a flashlight and then get it lit properly he liked to play with that and had some good ideas of how to get scenes very logically constructed and visually very nice by playing with his little paper dolls Stanley found out that I was on the same lot that he was preparing the shining and he took me on a tour of the sets which were I had never seen anything quite like it before then Stanley showed me how he planned his shots he had a Nikon still camera and he had rigged a periscope that went from the lens straight down so when he took me into a miniature version of all the sets of the Overlook Hotel he could put that little periscope down into the set and he could basically take a lot of pictures and plan where his camera was going so I had a real tutorial that first day I went to L Street from the great master himself you know it took seven days to light that bathroom every morning the first thing we would do when Stanley come in we would go right to that hit and he would adjust filters and lights and get rid of this he wanted an icy-cold blue ambiance and I think he accomplished that mission too the reason that my Stanley's days longer than probably most other people is because we would shoot for the designated hours but then we would go off into another part of the studio and test the sets light and tester sets with just a skeleton crew like five or six people and then we would maybe do two or three hours there get some food in and invariably was very relaxed at the end of the day in the shining McDonald's would arrive in those day the hamburgers from McDonald's were a big thing then after our hamburgers you do lighting test and it was fascinating to see the way he was doing like in tests I learned all the time because Stanley is a great great teacher well that's that bear I have to say that's probably but one of the things Stanley enjoyed as much as anything and it was a very very relaxed it was almost like a social evening I would say and it was very enjoyable you know we had no standings he said well I can't light the scene to a Stannis that's you so we had to be completely dressed quaffed even with my sword and do our own standing in until it's lit which could take half a day they touch us up and we begin shooting no matter how good a standing is you bring them in and you light them and it never looks right I don't feel right is there a standing and the second the actor comes in boom there's like a spark that happens and it's the only time you can tell if you really feel the lighting in right or not [Music] Stanley didn't like big crews it was a thing that he had he never wanted to have more people around than was necessary and sometimes he it was a hundred percent right and sometimes he was you know he was wrong and we'd have to get more people in because we didn't have enough but he generally speaking didn't like to have more people than was really essential we had a very very humble set up on Eyes Wide Shut we had four offices and a Xerox machine we were very few people you could go on our set and you thought they had wrapped we did major major scenes on Eyes Wide Shut and we had a setup of seven people very very very simple he was totally entrusted with his budget with his money with that nobody interfered Warner Brothers trusted him and he knew that he knew he had to deliver and I think that's a secret that's relatively small crew because we went over scheduled by 200% but certainly only 10% of a button on the whole Stanley thought time is the most important thing that you spend with actors and if you have such an emotional story such incredibly complicated thought processes it go into these scenes you want to take time and keep his crew very small keep it all as cheap as possible and take the time with Eyes Wide Shut it was scheduled for 89 days that shoot after day one we were half a day behind schedule and I just thought that's great how wonderful this one's getting rolling on and rolling on and rolling up on the course sheets you know you'd have day 24 straight out of 89 and day 50 out of 89 so when we got to day 89 and we still had a third of it to do he said well what do we do now stand him tomorrow do we put day 90 out of 89 or and just said don't put any days at all that was it the number of days we've been shooting he was taking off the cold sheet and we never thought about it again he told me that his favorite part of filmmaking is editing because in the editing room that's where the film comes to life and he loved editing he couldn't wait to finish the movie he said I only really enjoyed making films after the actors are gone and I just have it to myself Full Metal Jacket was the first time that yes she started using computer editing systems we had over a million feet of film The Full Metal Jacket which ended up as not even six double reels it was astonishing every word of dialogue was listened to every single tape was looked at and before you know of computer editing systems of course everything had to be cut spliced tried and then there were so many combinations of it if a character that Sarah had a simple line like I love you just for argument's sake okay and it was 40 tapes or 50 things you'd listen to every single eye in isolation every single love in isolation and every single you in isolation and then bit by bit he'd start knocking out the ones that sounded like nothing he'd find the right combination of I love you so you could only thank God The Full Metal Jacket yeah that we actually had a computerized editing system he used to play music through the editing process close to something that he thought might work and then you know the choices would bear a down narrow down he used to say that the biggest music library in the world is the world so you know try and find it there Stanley was an extremely musical man he was often accused he didn't use enough composers and so on because he was playing music around the clock and he was always hooked on something he was himself a drummer and he liked anything from Dixieland and jazz and modern music and classical music hugely Catholic tastes in I mean enormous range of music they're interested in he always had to tune in mind so for instance to have the waltz in 2001 [Music] he said everything in space turns you can't be out there without going in circles like a walls it's giving you such an atmosphere which you just put the picture into that context instead of the other way around it's not reinforcing a mood of drama or humor or anything it's just this is where we are it set up a whole different feeling in different understanding of what was going on you did it with all of them he get as much pleasure out of dealing in the distribution and marketing of his films as he did with making the movie so he was watching them grow and grow from there you know birth at the opening through the release and making sure that every stage was done to benefit the film Stanley made a point quite how he managed to do it I don't really know of studying and learning and coming up with alternative ways of doing things or at least questioning the old ways of doing things so as a result of that he learned his way around different aspects of the contractual advertising and distribution issues as well Stanley wanted to control advertising even when the studios to have anything to do with it he would want to see which of kind of three ways could be better so you had a have to get all of the information from each of the three ways and presented to him before an action could be taken the great example was the film poster for Clockwork Orange he had found a couple of newspaper illustrations and one of them that I found that he found happen to be Philip castle they set up a screening of very rough footage I took a little writing palette Basildon Bond writing palette and I was drawing in the dark you know ideas as they came from the screen because he was leaping with ideas Mike would take the drawings would look at them and then he would take them to Stanley they looked at them together and he would have chosen that format of the a and the college one director that was really interesting that Stanley told me was asked Philip to do the logo as well I found that if someone is creative in one area they could be just as creative in a related area even though they won't know where and I said Philip what we need the titles we just give it a shot and he said well I don't really do and then Sally comes up with it and then Stanley had him do the title treatment in every single language so Philip was working on the title treatment of Clockwork Orange for a year I finally didn't really know what he wanted until he saw it at least as far as artwork I knew that he wanted to see lots of ideas rather than one lukewarm idea developed with Full Metal Jacket of course he knew he knew we wanted that okay it was just the means of getting get into it I've come across a lot of directors who want to get involved in the process and have demanded certain approval rights but none of them had the authority that Stanley did I do remember on one occasion when we were working on the shining I'd been involved in some very complex discussions on the telephone with the Stanley and so I got up and started wandering around the office as one does and I wandered into the office of the theatrical supervisor for Europe Middle East and Africa at the time this is about three minutes later and he goes Stanley and I can see that he's looking at a newspaper or a photocopy of the newspaper from France and he's looking at the timing of the screenings at a cinema in Lille and he's talking about yep if we move that by 10 minutes we could then start 10 minutes earlier we get an extra screening in and of course he was probably supposed to be shooting a film at the time for Warner Brothers instead of doing all of this stuff but that didn't stop Stanley when you were choosing to make movies that appealed to you and not being concerned about the box-office potential whether their commercial whether their mainstream you're gonna have trouble Stanley and I always liked pictures that would not mainstream not because they would not mainstream they just happened to be esoteric or away from from popular type of movies what can you do about a bad review nothing if you are creator once you've put your work out there it's kind of not yours anymore you then open yourself up to all the criticism there is and if people interpret it one way that's their interpretation you mustn't explain it because you did it and now it's out there and let people take from it what they will he did like people to enjoy his work to like his well you know you can criticize it by all means but you know that wasn't a problem to him I'm sure but he liked it I think he liked to feel it once he delivered something that look at the film you know examine it and you know and be critical yes but you know see what I've what I've tried to do it's interesting for example the reaction to 2001 there is a man who did just Dr. Strangelove and Lolita and passive Gloria now he takes a bow to the unknowable creator of the universe and many people over 40 or 50 were angered by this it got very mixed reviews it was not the iconic film that has now become there were a lot of bad reviews for this film Stan Lee told me that when they first showed it in Washington for the sort of politico's there was a guy from MGM at the back with a clicker and Stanley was what are you doing he goes I'm counting that how many people leave and there was like 380 left the movie just didn't get it 2001 was saved by teenagers yeah there's no doubt about it Bob teenagers let's say bi people between 12 and 30 particularly young boys were absolutely infused by 2001 for the first time we see an so called science fiction film as something which is very philosophical almost spiritual that hasn't been done before Pauline Kael didn't like it she thought it was incredibly boring but 12 year olds and 14 year olds saw something that is indirectly a very very strong presence but it isn't talked about Eyes Wide Shut was the most difficult film of his life but he also considered Eyes Wide Shut his greatest contribution his greatest contribution to the art of filmmaking I remember a fax from Japan office which said how wonderful this film was and that couples are leaving the cinema holding hands so many people have come to me over the last four or five years and said you know I just saw Eyes Wide Shut again I hadn't seen it since its release and I get it now where I didn't before and it was exactly the same with Barry Lyndon said exactly the same with 2001 people who didn't get it when they first saw it the critical reaction to Barry Lyndon hurt him for years I mean he was upset disappointed depressed about him he was very very disappointed that the film wasn't successful because one of the things he wanted to be sure is that Warner Brothers kept their money back it was much more important to him but the backers get the money back then that he got paid which is good so that's best part of his character so yes that was the biggest disappointment and Barry Lyndon he also disappointed that people enough people liked the film I know when Barry Lyndon came out it wasn't wildly worried people would say my god it's through yours long you know all this sort of thing but the latest release in London give it five stars and across the board and you know I meet people who say yeah it's my favorite Kubrick which is a little bit heartwarming BBC BBC television they ran a series of his films everything from Lolita on to Full Metal Jacket and so the Sunday they showed Barry Lyndon he watched it I think it's the first time he'd actually watched that film from beginning to end without a break and the next day came bouncing into my office he said it really is a great movie sort of Mia I said yeah we've been telling you that for years and one of the big tragedies for me one of the most upsetting things to me is that he's never been honored in any way by the Academy I doubt that it'll come now because I think it's just gone on I think it's too long now but I mean his body work come on surely suddenly somebody's summer is that even if it was a posthumous award of you know Lifetime Achievement Award I mean or whatever if any director should be awarded something by the Academy it has to be Stanley Kubrick [Music] daddy had died and the house was full of stuff shelves cupboards rooms famously boxes statues awards scripts you name it he would take everything out of his office when the film was finished give it to the driver and he would dump it at home we said just put it in bloody Bell room and because we have enough room it was just put somewhere I'll tidy it up he had good intentions but it was total I never did which in a way was good because had he tidied up here would have been ruthless you don't value your own rubbish around everywhere Stan Lee famously kept everything everything was labeled in boxes and there were whole storerooms full of stuff he never threw anything away I was very depressed when I saw it all because a person seemed suddenly very long dead when the paper starts to go yellow it's a most depressing thing to do to open up and oh my god yes and you start reading old letters and sooner or later you start to cry and it is it's it's a horrible widows fate that one I had no idea what to do then through the Frankfurt film museum and I talked to hospitalize man who ran it and we got the idea of doing the Stanley Kubrick exhibition he sent me an archivist very talented archivist because it takes talent to spot what is interesting we had an archivist here for eight nine months with his white gloves going through everything meticulously he became a member of the family and he and we found things that we didn't know were there he opened my eyes to a great deal what people would be interested in in the beginning I thought would he find dis embarrassing or that embarrassing once you start on that you find almost everything embarrassing if it's written down on horrible paper or if you doodled even the old yellow pads with a ring of coffee stains and horrible remarks on the side you drank all my orange juice it said on one but of course that's what interested people this gives you a little bit of an idea of what this person was like and so we had to really go through it very carefully so that was a lot of work but in a way it now gave me something to do that made sense so I could stop just sitting there and crying it was something positive to do and it was very valuable in every way [Music] [Music] we knew that eventually the an exhibition or a traveling exhibition as it now is where would that stuff go so it had to find a final resting place several museums and countries you know were considered but you know we lived in England and daddy liked England and we're also very close to Europe where his films were hugely appreciated so it enables anybody who's interested in the medium of film at all to come and look at that archive and look at all his stuff [Music] we are sitting in the University of the Arts London archives and Special Collections Centre where we house the Stanley Kubrick archive the store room itself is kept at a constant 17 degrees centigrade 50 percent relative humidity which is kind of about the optimum temperature and humidity level for things like photographs and paper it's pretty much top of the range as far as archival storage is concerned the majority of the archive is paper-based or photography based there's something like eight hundred and twenty linear meters worth of material in boxes and plan chests it spans the entire of his career so we've got everything from original copies of Look magazine from when he was a photojournalist in the 1940s all the way through to material that relates to Eyes Wide Shut and obviously because he was so involved in every aspect of filmmaking the film materials can relate to all of those aspects as well so everything from kind of draft scripts his notes on the original novels all the way through to advertising designs and which quotes to use on the ads and we have a huge range of researchers come in anything from academics writing books or our own University of the Arts London students students from other film schools even members of the general public who were just interested in seeing a bit of Stanley's stuff I would love to see Renoir's palette you know I would love to see Vermeer's brushes whatever it is that you're into you want to be in the presence the ghostly presence and feel some of the mojo of the people who practice the work that you you love to do so I get that completely [Music] you [Music] I stayed in touch with Stanley until he started production on Eyes Wide Shut I called him up one day and I don't remember why I was calling I was I said hey Stanley it's Matthew yeah what do you want and it was the first time he'd ever said something like that to me I didn't want anything I was just except conversation and see how he was doing I spent two years with him working on Full Metal Jacket so him saying something like that to me while it was punching the gut it was just because he was getting busy on another project and I had to respect that but that was the last time I spoke to him [Music] for me he died too young because there are times when you you know you feel that you want to have a conversation not about anything in particular lot about work about anything but those moments come back to me more often now than they did in the in the early days for me that I wish I could have spoke to him one more last time just been in his company one last time he's a somebody that if you were invited to sit with him you wouldn't turn it down you know you you would hang out he was such an interesting guy we were not only business associates but we were we were really best friends and we were together all the time we played poker together we went to the stock market offices at 6:00 in the morning we played touch football it was dedicated to his family he dedicates it was work I know him as a regular guy I worshipped him I loved him Stanley was a I I think he's the best director ever I know his history and I know where he came from and how difficult the climb was and how many knows he had had to put up with the rejections he had had to put up with in his life I was quite shocked when he died all I could think of it what would have been all the great movies that were never going to see what makes an artist my definition of an artist is somebody who does something that does not disappear that's relevant for the next generation Kubrick will not disappear you may not like him it has nothing to do with it yeah people didn't particularly like the French Impressionists and they changed the way people paint and so Stanley's films changed everything I feel you know my education didn't start until I started working for Stanley then coming to work with Stanley I'm in this you know like suddenly jumping on a roller coaster it was quite something quite exhilarating it was funny witty tremendously stimulating and a good laugh yeah great guy when people ask me if I miss him you know even now well yeah I do I mean of course they do it didn't really hit me now he wasn't around it until the October of that year because by then I'd kicked out the very last theatrical prints of Eyes Wide Shut so from March to October I was kind of just keeping myself going October it was the first time I ever went on Prozac okay it was the first time I ever went on an antidepressant because I crashed so quickly that's when I realized he really wasn't around anymore he was a very passionate loving concerned husband father dog owner employer he was probably one of the most caring people ever in the met if it was in his power to do something to help somebody who needed it or an animal who needed it he would be there and he would always try yeah not many like him so I miss him miss him a lot I really consider myself extremely lucky we were people from the most opposite side of things and so in that sense we both were lucky that we were a good match when he was dead I really suffered I didn't have his voice to give me the rundown or what he thought anything that he ran across him he was very interested and intensely so his sounds like such a cliche but he was really engaged in life every part of it that kind of energy and enthusiasm and intensity made him very different from other people to me he was brilliant he was unique he was Stanley Kubrick [Music] [Music]
