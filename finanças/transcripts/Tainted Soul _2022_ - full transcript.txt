Yes. Yes, dear. I will pray for you. I'm sure you're capable of it. I know. Tell me if anything happens. Very well. I wish you success. Okay. I love you, son. - Look, it's him. - Oh? What is it? What did he draw? Stay there! - Don't move! - Why did you draw a ghost? What is that? Why? Are you a medium? You bastard! Shithead! What are you all doing? You dare bully other students? You still have a long way to go. You will be treated the same when you graduate. You will be bullied by others. Leave him alone, now! Thank you. Don't just stand still if you are treated badly. Sure. Sorry for causing trouble. Thank you, sir. Help me. Marni. Calm down, sir. Happy birthday! Let me see. So funny! Guys, I think I'll go home now. - What did you say? - I'm going home now. - Really? - ...my mother... It's still early! - Vanessa, come on... - I'm sorry, I must go. - Are you serious? - Bye! - Bye! - Bye! Yes, honey. Be patient. I'm heading there. Hello? Hello? Who are you? Who are you? Hey, asshole! We have unfinished business. I'm going to beat you up. - Hello? - How about it, Rakka? I've considered it. I'd better go back to Bogor. You mean here? Yes. Back home. What else do you want? What is it, Grandma? Want to show me your grave? Who do you want revenge against? Listen, Grandma. Let's go over there. Come on. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hey! Come here! Come! Have a drink! - Excuse me. - Yes? - Is there a toilet here? - No. The toilet is far from here. So? Do you want to order a drink? Bajigur. Coming right up. Can you help me? I want to change clothes, but the toilet is far from here. Please sit here to cover me changing clothes. Don't peek! Good grief! Thank you! We haven't introduced ourselves. I'm Rakka. Why are you sad? I'm not. I just... I'm glad to finally have a chat. Luckily it rained. Otherwise, I wouldn't have dared to invite you to have a chat. Why? Why wouldn't you have dared to talk to me? Well, because... I don't know what to say. This is your drink. Thank you. Just one? What about my friend here... Where is she? You came here alone. I didn't. Are you okay? So, do you feel nostalgic? - I do. - Look at these. Nothing's changed. I haven't changed a thing. When will you clean it up? I will one day, trust me. Rakka? You haven't lost your alertness. That's great! Keep practicing, okay? - You still do writing? - Of course! Look! All of them. A producer wanted to make it into a film, but I rejected it. Even if the fee is high, it's no use if the concept is wrong. Don't just try to scare people. The story is important too, you know. Right? Your uncle is a writer now. Don't you need the money? I do need the money, but I still have some idealism in me. Still practice shamanism? Not anymore. I don't want to be a sinner. People look for mediums to help them attract someone they like or to harm others. They think that all mediums are bad. We're not practicing black magic, you know. Even though I'm black... You can't say that. I'm just messing with you. Forget it! - Uncle! - Yes? I have a question. Do you still get frequent visits by ghosts? They keep appearing. We can't avoid them. It's the legacy of your grandfather. One for each generation. You and I. Your late mother was always concerned about this legacy that could trouble you in the future. That's why your mother tried so hard to get rid of it. But it wouldn't go. It still bothers me. That's why your parents moved you to Jakarta. For your future. However... Here, drink that first. - We keep talking and forgetting to drink. - True. Rakka. Are you sure that going to school here will make a difference? - There are ghosts everywhere. - That's not the issue. I know that there are ghosts everywhere. But, I... I feel that being in Jakarta doesn't suit me. Listen, you have to learn to ignore them. If they appear, just ignore them. Just pretend that you don't see them. Whoa! Are you a ghost? I've done that before I know. A SINGLE ACCIDENT KILLED ONE MARRIED COUPLE THE VICTIMS OF THE JAGORAWI TOLL ACCIDENT LEFT BEHIND A SON - Volcano? - That's hard. - Honey drop? - It was easy - It just spins around. - Do you have a cigarette? - I have some. - Romy has some. You attended the party, right? - Stumble, stumble? - Yeah. - Excuse me! Sorry, sorry! - Idiot! Hey, asshole! You moron! Are you blind?! I'm so sorry! I didn't see you. Idiot! I think I know him. Teach him a lesson! Where does he come from? I don't know. SUMPAH PEMUDA BOGOR HIGH SCHOOL Excuse me, sir. - Thanks. - All right. Hi! Do you go to this school? You have to learn to ignore them. Just pretend that you don't see them. Hello? Do you see me? We met at the bus station. It was raining. We walked under your umbrella. We then went to the stall. Do you remember? Sir! Sir! Wait! Please, let us in. - What time is it? - There are five minutes left. - Please open the gate. - This is a bad habit. - Please, sir. - Open it! - Please open it. - Not a chance. - Mr. Dudung, open it. - I won't! I can't do it. You do it. No, what should I tell my father? Tell him to cancel the donation. The security here is incompetent. Tell him that the name is Dudung. So? You did the right thing! - Have you heard... - Who? I'm going to the canteen. Poor Vanessa. No one thought that she would die tragically. Are you happy now that she's gone? Do you think you'll be happy after her death? ALL OF US, THE BIG FAMILY OF SUMPAH PEMUDA BOGOR HIGH SCHOOL, EXPRESS OUR CONDOLENCES FOR THE PASSING OF VANESSA DANIELA. Erlin, you scared me. Ms. Tara, I was in the toilet. - Sonya needs... - Erlin needs a sanitary pad. I told her not to bother you. - I have one. - Yes. Let's go to the classroom. - We're leaving. - All right. Everyone! This is Rakka. He's a new transfer student from Jakarta. I want you all to help him with the final exam. Rakka, you can sit next to Sonya. Ma'am! He can't sit here. This is Vanessa's seat. We are still mourning. Sonya, it's been two weeks. I know you're mournful. We are too. Let's just pray for Vanessa. Rakka, you can sit there. Sir, you can continue. Thank you. All right, class. Let's begin. Open your books to page 28, chapter 2, linear programming. Do you enjoy it? Sitting there? - Sorry? - That's my friend's seat. Vanessa. She's dead. And I'm sure she'll not appreciate someone sitting in her seat. You two at the back! Lower your voice! Listen. You will move after this class is over. - But... - Just move, asshole. What are you doing? - Hey! - Hey! Why did you stare at my girlfriend? What did you draw? How do you know...? What is it, Sonya? Nothing, sir. Nothing happened. Who are you drawing? Is she your girlfriend? You can see me, can't you? You just pretended not to hear me. Rakka! Rakka! Hello? Hello! Rakka! Listen, Mom. I will leave if Bruno isn't home. - Hi, Sonya! - Did you find him? Well... I've been looking for Bruno since after school. I don't know where he is! - You have to call the police. - I know. I've asked my mom to report it to the police. I've reported it. Just wait then. I hope Bruno comes back to you soon. Okay, thank you. Where are you? Honey, come out here! Bruno! Where is he? Show yourself! Show yourself! Where is he? Show yourself! My daughter hasn't been home for two days. Please, if you know something about her... Please wait, ma'am. Rakka! Ask Sonya to come here. This is Lisbeth's last note before she ran away after Bruno went missing. Sonya, just leave it, okay? It's not our problem. Dodit, I'm worried about her. What if something happened to her? Or this could be... - This is related to... - Forget it! Don't, okay? Don't link everything to the masked ghost, okay? It could be a lie. Maybe, it's all just... in your head. What do you mean? Do you think I'm crazy? - Sonya, wait. - You're crazy. - You're out of your mind. - Sonya, hey. Excuse me, Sonya. Ms. Tara is looking for you. She's with Lisbeth's mother and a police officer. Nar, let's go. Where are you going? - Not that fast. - Sit! Sit there! Romy, grab his bag! Can't you sit? Sit there! Don't move, sit there, and do everything I say! Rakka, I told you. I don't want you to talk about the ghost in this class. And I also don't like... I don't want you to go near Sonya! - Open your mouth! Eat it! - Open it! Eat it! - Thanks. - Don't mention it. Where did she go? Cut the act! I know you can see me. What do you want? I helped you. That's not what I asked! Every ghost who approaches me has their motives. Who do you want revenge on? I don't want revenge. Do you want to show me your grave? My grave? Where is it? - I don't remember. - What do you want? To have a chat with you. Have a chat? - Yes. - Just that? As a ghost, sometimes it feels lonely. Nobody notices my existence. I feel lonely. I don't have friends. Sometimes, I prank someone by blowing their ears or grabbing their hair when they're daydreaming. Or I tickle them when they're crying so they stop crying. Why did you follow me? You're the only one who can see me. Don't you know it? I'm happy that we met at the bus station. - We went to a stall, and then... - I know. I'm disappointed. Why? Because I am a ghost? So, you're lonely too? I'm not! Who says so? - I have friends! - Who? Ajat! - Ajat? - Yes. Ajat... The point is, don't follow me if you don't need my help. I know what kind of help I need from you. I don't know who I am. I don't even remember my name. Liar! Really? Ghost cannot lie! How? You died because your head hit something and you lost your memory? I don't know. I don't remember. I swear! Can ghosts swear? They can! Just to make you believe it. Fine, I'll help you. How can I find out about you? Rakka! Who are you talking to? Answer me. Rakka, are you an indy? An indy? They can communicate with ghosts, right? It's indigo, stupid! I see. They took a different name. Answer me! Why are you staring at me? Rakka, when you first entered the classroom, did you see the masked ghost? What did the ghost tell you? Do they want to take revenge? Hey, what are you doing? Come here! - What's happened? - He said he can see the masked ghost. Explain it! Can you? You said yes. Right, Nar? Don't be a liar. That was a lie, wasn't it? Yes. - Ouch! - Bastard! Satisfied, huh? He said that to get your attention. Come on. Let's go. Dodit, Rom, he can see it! Why didn't you do something, Rakka? - Fight them! - I wish you hadn't shown up. Then they wouldn't think I'm a freak. Are you? The ability to see ghosts is cool! If it was cool, I wouldn't have had to change schools. - But... - You just don't get it! You can't get it! You're a demon. A ghost. A spirit. You don't have emotions or a need to be accepted in school. So, I beg you... to stop following me. Rakka... Don't. I said don't! Just stay there! You're a coward! There's no one else who's like you! Rakka! You said that you'd stopped practicing it. I did it for the purpose of my book research. So, how was school today? It was fine. I'll go eat. Rakka, wait! What is it? Did that pretty ghost appear? She did. So? I scolded her. She's gone? She's gone. That's great. Right? You did the right thing. I'll go eat. I bet that must be one pretty ghost if he can't stop thinking about her. Rom, here it is! Two have died. Oh, shit, no! Leave this. Turn back. Just two? There is one more! Die! Just die! I've killed three, Rom! The banana tree! Without the banana! Just a minute. Rom? Yes, move forward. That's right. A blackout? Rom? Romy? Masked ghost! Nar... Call Nino. I called, but he didn't answer. He likes to play games all night. Go to his dormitory. What if something has happened to him? What are you thinking could have happened to him? Are you worried he's cheating on you? - He could be. - What about me? Stop it! Do your work! Where is she? SUMPAH PEMUDA BOGOR HIGH SCHOOL Come out! Don't hide! I know you're here. Hey! What are you doing here? This is school property. This is a restricted area. Leave! I will! I'm sorry. Excuse me, sir. JAKARTA-BOGOR TRANS GREATER JAKARTA Excuse me, sir. I know I was wrong! I know I'm a coward. But, please, I need you as a friend. You're not a coward. If you were, you wouldn't have come here. Admitting your mistakes is brave. So is being a forgiving person. Thank you. I want you to know, I feel pity for all the ghosts who asked for my help. That's why I never refuse their requests. I wish I knew who I was. Why am I still in this world? I don't even know if there's someone who is missing me. I'm sure there is. Who? I am. You? Yes. You don't hate me? I don't hate you. I did hate you, but not anymore. I even looked for you here. Really? Come on, hope on. Have you? Come on! Rakka! Wait! Be ready. There is a downhill slope ahead. The number you're calling is... It can't be, Nar. Nino can't suddenly be missing. I know, Dit. I'm confused too. This can't happen. He can't just be suddenly missing. That's right. It's happened again and again. Vanessa. Lisbeth. And now, Nino. Don't you think this is strange? Stop talking nonsense. Nar. Did he do it live or record his YouTube content? He usually recorded, edited, and uploaded it. So, there is a video? - So? - Let's see it. Oh, right. Here. - Can you? Let me. - Why did he change it? - See? We're in. - How? Who is "Angelica 2006"? You don't know? That is his ex! What? He's an asshole! I'm leaving! Romy's right. He's gone with his ex! Let's go home. What have you done, No? Come on. - Nar. - What? Don't be a drama queen. - We're wasting our time! - Listen to me! Nino is missing. Nar, Son, look. Here is the video. Romy... Guys, here is the video. Let's play it. A blackout? Let me fast forward. He's still playing. Look. He was offline yesterday. Why are the lights off? - Rom? Romy? - Yes, and the keyboard is still on. That's weird. What did he do? Masked ghost! - What was that? - What? Masked ghost! - Masked ghost? - Masked ghost? Ka, did you feel something? Well... Hi! Hi there! - She won't leave me. - I see. Here. Throw as hard as you can! - Want me to show you? Okay. - Yes. - Wanna try it? - Yes. Like this? That's right. Throw it. Slay. - Why? - That far? - You don't believe I can throw that far? - No way! Try again. - Huh? - You're just lucky. Is this really your first time? - It is. One... - Throw it. Thanks. You're welcome. I hope you like it. Why "Windy"? I feel that you are like the wind. You come and go as you please. Thank you, Rakka. I have a name now. You're welcome. Isn't she pretty? She is. Wait. - What did you say? - Nothing. Just eat the noodles. - Don't wait until they become jelly. - Thanks. You do like her, don't you? - Like her? - Come on! I mean you like her just like I like my noodles. Right? Well... I do like her, but... No, I mean... I feel like I know her from somewhere, but I can't remember where. I want to give you just a little reminder. She is a ghost, not a living being. - I know. - I'm sure you know. ...87,24 on Nuansa FM, and we're here... - Wait! - What is it? - Let's dance. - Why? - Come on! - I'm about to eat. - Let's dance. - Let me eat first. - You ate earlier. - I know, but... - Let's dance first. - No, eat first. - Later. - One more bite. - No, dance first. - Well, all right. - How? - Just dance. Teach me. Like this? - What dance is this? - Look! - Nabila. - Thank you, sir. - Fauzan. - Thank you, sir. Sonya, Dodit, Romy, Nara. You all have the lowest scores. Thank you, sir. Where is Nino? He's absent today. He got a bad score, yet he skips a class. Remember, this is the pre-exam. The real test is next week. I don't think you will pass if this is your exam score. - Marissa. - Thank you. Well done, Erlin. You have the best score. Are you happy I got a bad score? - I'm not... - Well? You dare disobey me? - Stupid bitch... - Enough! - No one is mocking you. - Let go of my hand. I will if you promise not to hurt her. Hey, let go of her hand. Don't hurt Erlin. Let go of her hand! If you want to talk, talk to me. Not to my girlfriend! Stop hurting Erlin. Fine, I won't hurt her. But you must kiss my shoes. - Come on, kiss it! - Kiss it! - Kiss it! Do you want to be a hero? - Kiss it! Be a real hero! Kiss it! Come on, kiss it! Why do I keep complying with them? Stupid! I'm an idiot! You're not a stupid person! Well, maybe you're a bit of a freak. But you're not stupid. You did a good thing by defending your friend. It's useless! It's no use for me to help others if they don't care about me. They are more scared than you. They just prioritize their safety. Then what am I? You're different. You're not stupid. You're a great person! - I know, but... - I'm proud of you, Rakka! I'm screwed! Hello? Hello? Rom? - Have you got the exam questions? - I haven't. I got locked in. What? You got locked in the lab? Listen, my mother will be mad at you if you fail to get them. I know. - Damn it! - Sonya... What happened? Romy hasn't got the exam questions. We're screwed! Don't worry. Just chill, okay? He will get them. Okay? You can buy it yourself. Guys. What? The questions! Thank God. He got them! We've suddenly become smart. Stop your nonsense. - Let's go. - Okay. Hi! Erlin, open it! Come on! Here! There. - Solve it, now! Do it now! - I'm doing it! Hold it! My hand is sore! Rom? Romy? Rom, help me! Nino? Rom, help me! What are you doing here? No... Help me... Rom... Rom, help me. Help me! Sir, open the door! Sir, please open it! Romy is calling. Don't answer it. It's getting late. - Turn it off. - I agree! We'll meet tomorrow, though. Sonya! Please help me! There is Nino's voice! He's dead! Sonya, please help me! Sonya, help me! Rom, this is me, Dini. Dini? Sorry I'm late, sir. I was in the School Medical Room. Take a seat. Romy is missing. He hasn't been home since yesterday. Do not cheat. Windy. Have you seen this ghost at school? I haven't. Why is it? You've been harassed by her? I don't know. She didn't tell me what she wanted when she showed up. She even almost attacked me. It's like she... I don't want you to be harassed by a ghost. POLICE INVESTIGATE THE CASE OF A STUDENT WHO WAS KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT IN BOGOR A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT IN BOGOR, DINI TANTRAYANI, WAS KILLED AFTER GETTING HIT BY A BUS Rakka. Do you know a girl named Dini at your school? Dini Tantrayani. Erlin! Wait! Was there once a student named Dini here? She died after a bus hit her. - I don't... - Believe me. Don't be afraid. I need to know. Did you know her? Do you have her photo? She was in the school magazine. She won a dance festival. You can find the magazine in the library. What magazine? Pelajar, last year's edition. Here they are! Loser number 1 and loser number 2. What are guys talking about? Ignore her. Moron! Let's go. A MODEL STUDENT WINNER OF PIALA WALIKOTA BOGOR What do you want from me? Windy? What happened? You acted strange. Rakka! What happened to you? You... - You're the masked ghost! - Me? You hurt our friends! You hurt me! I didn't! - No way. - Your name is Dini. - Dini? - You're an evil spirit. So, my name is Dini? Dini, open the door, child. Let me in. Leave me alone. Dini. I promise to report this problem to the school. Don't, sir. As you said, the problem will grow. How can I help? Come on, Dini. I can't bear to see you like this. I am worried. Open the door, honey. Dini. Hello? Don't worry, Father. You can keep working as usual. I can deal with it. I will solve the problem on my own. Boo! Looks like someone wants to run away. Come here! Come here! You're a traitor! Nino! You're great! - Bitch! - Don't move! - Teach her a lesson! - So, you want to report us? - Teach her! - No? Don't lie, be honest! - Look at him! - Look! Such a crybaby! - Do you want me to film it? - Listen carefully! I don't want you or your father to make a fuss in this school. - Look at him! - Such a crybaby! If that happens, I will make sure you and your father suffer. - Get it? - Remember that! - You're cute when you cry. - Get it? - Answer him! - Get it? - I understand. - Hey! - Hey, stop it! - It's Dudung. - Rom. - She's running! - Such a crybaby! - Fuck you, bitch! - Come on, go cry! - Dini... WHAT WE ENJOY TODAY IS THE LEGACY OF OUR PREDECESSORS, AND WHAT WE ENJOY NOW WILL BE PASSED DOWN FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS Dini! Come home, honey! Let us go home! Father... Where are you going? Watch out! Dini! Dini! Dini! Dini! Dini! Dini! I didn't know I was the masked ghost. - I swear! - Don't swear! My job is done, right? You already know who you are. Don't meet me again. Do it! From now on, the masked ghost is gone. Your revenge on Sonya and Dodit... I'll take care of it. Rakka, don't do it! Rakka! What the hell! What are you doing? Lunatic! Asshole! What do you want? Huh? I know you killed Dini! You created the masked ghost! Asshole! Dodit! It's enough. Rakka! Don't. Ask her to leave. I don't want to see her. Rakka. I've studied it. Dini probably doesn't know anything about the masked ghost. - What do you mean? - Listen. Look at this. Aki Ayat once wrote here. "Two-faced demon." The demon has different and contradictory personalities, which often happens because the suffering and grudge of the original personality was too big. The original personality couldn't bear them. So, a new personality character appears. This new personality is vicious and attacks everyone that they hate. Who is it? I see. You reported me. You bitch! - Answer me! Is it true? - Yes. I've had enough of seeing you bully Erlin. You dare?! The daughter of the school guard wants a promotion. Do you know the consequences of disobeying me? Let her know, Sonya. You think I'm scared? Bitch! You dare go against us? Get up! - Don't move! - Listen to me! Starting today, we have a new slave. - Don't move! - Let go of me! So, Erlin, you don't have to serve me again. Let's begin! The appointment ceremony of the new slave. - Fuck you! You think I'm scared? - You dare defy me?! What a bold girl! Dodit! - Let go! - Don't move! Don't move, do you understand? - Open it! - Swallow it! - Come on! - Swallow it! Eat that! Are you crazy? What the fuck is wrong with you? - Eat it! - Swallow it! You bitch! - Don't move! - Do you want this? - Take that! - Don't move! - Do it! - Don't move! Give it to me! Sonya, don't do it! Sonya, don't... Sonya... - Sonya... - Shut up! Look at her! Look how pretty she is! Look at her! - How pretty! - Show us your new hair! You become prettier. Here. Smile! Let's change her hair. From today, you have to wear this mask in class. - That's right! - Answer her! Answer her! Introduce yourself. Come on, introduce yourself. Hi, guys, she is your new slave, Dini! Isn't she pretty? Give her a round of applause! Give her a round of applause! See? You bastard! I knew the masked ghost was not the culprit! I've already called the police! Dodit? - Hello? - Sonya? Mr. Dudung is the culprit, not the masked ghost. - What? - Mr. Dudung is the culprit! He attacked me earlier. He used... He used a wrench and came into my room. Yes, I am safe. But Mr. Dudung must have locked up our friends. Dod, listen. Rakka drew a woman as a masked ghost. - It can't be... - Sonya, stop. Okay? Stop. I saw it myself! It's Mr. Dudung, not the masked ghost. Where are you? I'm at the usual café. All right. Wait there. We have to go to school now! The two-faced demon has an evil personality. Sooner or later, Dini's spirit will be controlled by the evil one. The evil spirit will seek revenge and destroy the living. Who summoned Dini's spirit? Someone who missed dearly the person who left them. Uncle... Perhaps it was Mr. Dudung. He came here the other night. He said that he'd learned black magic to summon his daughter's spirit. I didn't mean any harm. I just wanted to see my daughter again. - So, the evil spirit tagged along? - It could have. An evil spirit who makes Dini forget who she is. I guess this is the reason. Dini came to me to stop the masked ghost. I'm going to school now. - Rakka, don't be reckless! - I have to! Dini needs me. Help me... Dod, wait. Dod... - What? Can you shut up? - There's... It smells very bad here. Dung! Where are you? Show yourself! - Dod. - What? Let's get out of here. No, we're already here. Sonya, no! - We're here. - Dod! Don't try to fool me! - Dod. - Show yourself! - Let's get out of here! - Shut up! I told you to leave! Fuck! Dod! Bastard! Dung, open the door! I told you to leave! Dod, please! - Let's go home. - No! You bastard! Come out and fight me! - Let's go home. - Shut up! Shut your mouth! Come one, bastard! Dod! Dod, look out! Dod... Dod... Dodit? Fuck! Din... Din, please forgive me. I was wrong! I'm sorry! Din, please forgive me... I know I was wrong! Din... The two-faced demon can only be defeated when... Think, think... Father, I ask for your blessing to help Rakka. Why are we here this late? They only told us to come. They said we can't graduate if we don't. Why did Ms. Tara send us here? I don't have a clue. Get out! Hurry! - Get out now! - What happened? This way! Get out! There is a door over there! Move! Please stop it! Let go! Please stop it! Dini, I beg you to forgive me. Please forgive me. Please don't. Dini... Please don't... Dini... The lights are out. What's happening? Hey! Hey, what do we do? All the doors are locked! We're trapped! What do we do? Where did that ball come from? - Oh my God! - This is gasoline! What do we do now? There's someone there! Who is it? You all deserve to die! Dini? I believe you now. I believe you won't hurt your friends. You have a good heart. No! I brought your notebook. What a beautiful drawing! When you're grown up, you'll be a painter, and I'll be a dancer. Stand still. I'm painting right now. Okay, then. Look at this couple! - Give back to me! - How sweet! - Give it back! - No! It hurts. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. Here is your book. But I haven't finished my painting. You finish it first and then return the book to me. It's my fault. I should've recognized you. But, look. I've kept my promise to you. Thank you, Rakka. Dini. Don't let that demon control you. As long as you don't hold a grudge against anyone, it can't control you. Forgive us, Din. - Forgive us. - Forgive us. Please forgive us, Dini. Thank you, Din! Thank you, Din. Dini! That bracelet will protect you from the demon. Fight it! You can fight it. Don't give up! Dini... Dini, are you okay? Dini... I will take your life instead, Rakka! No one can stop me. You brought out the demon! Rakka! Rakka... You shouldn't have sacrificed yourself. Don't worry, I'm okay. I'm fine. Dini... Go back. Go back to where you belong. Windy? Isn't she pretty? She is. I'm sorry, what? What do you mean? I don't want you to be harassed by a ghost. Dini... Goodbye, Father. Dini, don't go! Dini, please don't go! Don't leave your father! Dini... Dini... Rakka! Thank you for saving us all. - I'm sorry, Dini... - Rakka. Your parents would be proud of you. Mr. Dudung, Dini is where she belongs. Let her go. BORN: SEPTEMBER 12 2005 PASSED AWAY: MARCH 12 2021 Goodbye, Dini.
