(somber music) (thudding) (dramatic organ music) (gentle music) - [Woman] Hello there. - Me? - Yeah. - [Mathis] What do you want? - Can I drive you somewhere? Don't look at me like that. I mean it, really. Oh, come on in. Don't be shy. Alright, where we going? - [Mathis] Notre Dame Cathedral. - Whatever you say. Sure beats hoofing it. - Yeah, thank you. - You mean you're splitting? - What? - [Woman] Aren't you going to invite me home for a drink? - I can't. I don't have a home. Not in Paris. - You from out of town? - Will you stop pestering me with stupid questions. - Oh, come on, don't you get upset now. It's just that I thought you lived next to the cathedral. - I wished I lived in one of those towers. The church is mankind's true home. - Poor darling. We'll do it right here, if that's the way you want it. Takes all kinds. I even have a customer who only makes it in cemeteries. - What are you talking about? - About this. Look, don't you think I'm attractive? Now, what do you say, huh? Come on, why don't you get a feel of it? - Uh. No! - I'll be darned. You're shy, you could have fooled me! - What do you mean? What are you talking about? - What am I talking about? You're all excited. Just relax now. It'll cost you a hundred and worth every penny of it. Hey, what's wrong with you? (footsteps echoing) Hey, where do you think you're going? You can't drop me like this! You really thought I was just chauffeuring you around? - [Mathis] You hussy! - [Woman] What the hell is this? - [Mathis] Don't you have any shame selling your body? - Why should I be ashamed? - [Mathis] You see nothing wrong with selling yourself? To the first man who comes along? Inciting him to sin, turning your body into the instrument of eternal damnation! Huh? - Stop it! - No, I won't! - You're mad! - [Mathis] No, I'm not mad. It's the hand of God's vengeance. You are going to pay for every soul you've damned! (woman screaming) You're a whore! The court of the Holy Inquisition said this deserves death! The flame will purify you and your soul. (woman screaming) (dramatic music) (whistle screeching) Shit, the cops! (footsteps echoing) - [Policeman] You there, stop! (footsteps echoing) (whistle screeching) - [Inspector Rochet] Is that him? - [Officer] Yes, Sir. - I'm glad to meet you. Take off your cap. - No, I won't. - [Inspector Rochet] I said take off your cap! - You'll pay the hospital bill if I catch cold? - Alright, I will. What's your name? - Bartholo. - I mean your real name. - Richard Bartholosky Pathem. But people usually call me Bartholo for short. - I'd like to hear your version of the facts. - My version? I was completely out. - [Officer] What do you mean by out? - It means I was pissed out of my mind. - Could be. The fact is that she was stabbed and you had a knife on you when you were arrested. - Ah, did you see the knife? Use it to peel potatoes. - You've been in jail before. - Yeah, for misdemeanors. But I don't go around killing women. I know it's hard to believe yet they rather like me. - I'm sure. Except you may have murdered one. And that's no misdemeanor. You listen good now. We're gonna keep you here a while. We're gonna charge you with first degree murder and we'll make it stick. Should we be wrong, I won't fail to excuse myself. Take him away. - [Officer] Come on. (Bartholo mumbles) - I don't mean to butt in, Inspector. But it seems to me you're after the wrong man. - You've been sent here by Interpol because they're after some kind of psychopath. Why don't you go after him? It's what you're here for. Do you read me, Inspector? Better mind your own business. (somber music) - Mathis. - Raymond. - It's been years since I last saw you, Mathis. You haven't changed a bit. After so many years, I recognized you the moment you came in. I heard about you. I was told you had some problems. - Yes. - You even were excommunicated. I find it hard to believe. You were the best of us all at the seminary. If you need help, you can count on me. - No, no help, no. No, I don't, nobody's. Not yours, not your kind. - [Raymond] I'm the only one who can help you. (somber music) (lively jazz music) - Hey, Charlie! Get your ass over here! Come on, drive me home. - [Charlie] Get on. - [Woman] You were supposed to take me. - [Man] But you can walk, can't you? Ciao! - Shit. (lively jazz music) (footsteps echoing) Who's there? Who's there? If it's you, John, come on out. Stop playing stupid games. John? (suspenseful music) John? (woman screaming) Help! Let me go! - Shut up! - What do you want? - Stop it, calm down! Calm yourself! - [Woman] Let me go! - I told you to shut up! - [Woman] Who are you? - I don't intend to harm you, child. - [Woman] Why are you following me? What do you want? - I simply want to save you. I have to punish you for your soul's sake. - No! I beg you let me go. Please, I didn't do anything wrong. - And so, I'll give you eternal life. - No, leave me alone! I didn't do anything wrong. - You committed a mortal sin. - No! - You bitch! You better not deny it! I saw you humiliate yourself - No! - [Mathis] in front of that young man a while ago! You begged him to take your innocence so as to pervert him! - No! - I saw you! Don't deny it! Don't you lie to me, Jezebel! Confess! - [Woman] What do you want? - To save you. - Let me go! - I'd rather save your soul. What I'm doing is for your own good. Don't you understand? - No, you're crazy! - [Mathis] I am the redeeming hand of the lord. - You're raving mad! That's what you are! (woman screaming) (dramatic music) (gentle music) - Send up the proofs. I want you to update the lead story. Yes, right. - Morning, Chief. - [Pierre] Morning, Ann. - Here's the mail. - Oh, thanks. - Did you like the show we put on? Didn't you like the way we did it? - Not bad. - Not bad? - It was okay. All I care about is how much it pays. - Look at the cheque. I'm sure the count appreciated it as always. - [Mathis] May I come in? - [Pierre] Yes, do come in. What can I do for you? - I'm Mathis Vogel. - Hi. My secretary. - How do you do? - How do you do? - I would like you to read this. You may like to run it in your magazine. - Really? Let's see it. Hmm, fine title. Return of the Grand Inquisitor. What's it about? - The story is somewhat unusual but what's important is that the facts stick to the truth and the story is quite timely. - Hmm, Mr Vogel, our magazine is open to any type of story. And, as you undoubtedly know, we specialize in sadomasochistic melodrama. - Yes, I know. You have a pretty large circulation. That's precisely why I came to you. - Thanks. What our public wants is strange emotions. - And what does your personal taste run to, Miss? - Oh, anything that turns on my imagination. - That goes for me too. - It's surprising, you don't look the type. You're a far cry from our usual writers. - What do I look like? - Mm, like a scientist or perhaps a teacher. Or even a poet. You don't have that tortured look. - Maybe I had it? I'd better go now. Read it and tell me what you think of it. - Alright, I'll be seeing you. - Goodbye. - Thanks Mr Vogel. - [Mathis] Goodbye, Ann. - [Both] Whew! - A real weirdo. - He's nuts! Did you see the way he looked at me? He was practically undressing me with his eyes. - Maybe he guessed you liked being undressed? Shrewd man. - [Ann] He's an out and out creep if you ask me. He scares me. - Can I undress you with my eyes then? - No. - Oh, we're invited to a party. - Where? - At the count's place next Friday. - We going? - Yeah, there'll be some kind of show. - [Ann] Erotic? - Very. And guess what he wants? He wants you to rustle up some virgins. - Is that so? Admit it's your idea. - [Pierre] I wouldn't know what to do with a virgin. It's the countess' idea. She wants to sacrifice one. - [Ann] Alright, but you'll have to shell out in advance. - Say the word. - What about now? - Now's great. - [Ann] Let's go to my place. I'll be comfortable there. - [Pierre] We don't have the time. - [Ann] What are you doing? Stop it, you're crazy! (moaning) (lively jazz music) - There you are. - How are you? - [Ann] I'm fine. - You're awfully late, Ann. - Oh, guess what? - [Rosie] Tell me. - It's the count, he needs a flock of virgins for a party. - [Rosie] What does he want virgins for? - He's putting on some kind of a show next Friday. Let's call Martha. - [Rosie] She's down at the club. Good idea, let's go ask her. - Let's go. Hurry up! - [Rosie] I'm coming. (lively jazz music) - [Pierre] Hi. - [Woman] Hiya. - Here comes Pierre. - Hi, my darlings! - Hello. - Hi, tell me the rest. - Hi, Pierre. - It's for some show and you know the usual thing except she wants it spectacular. Come along, we usually have a good time. - [Martha] But I'm no virgin. - What are you talking about? We'll just pretend you are. Who's gonna check? - Come on, it's great fun. - Now, clue me in. What happens afterwards? - Oh, nothing much. We fuck. - Everybody fucks? - Yeah. - Can I pick? - Of course, but forget him. He's a bad lay. - If you want to, you can pick a girl. Even both a girl and a man. - [Rosie] That's true. - Come on. - Those cats are loaded. - Oh, well, now that you put it that way. - You clinched the sale. - Right. - Well, cheers. - Right. (lively jazz music) - Hello. - What can I do for you? - Do you happen to have any rooms left? - Yeah, plenty. - I'd like one next to the two women who just walked in. - You mean Rosie and Annie. Yeah I get it. - Oh, that's just fine. - It's number three. May I have your name, please? - Mathis Vogel. (soft jazz music) - I'm not putting you down but your new recruit is nothing to brag about. She strikes me as a big bore. - You're jealous. (soft jazz music) I'm exhausted. - [Rosie] When you see a bed that's it. You plunk your ass on it. Look at your things. Don't you ever hang them up? You expect me to do it? - Yes, mom. - Just look at that mess. I'm not your maid. - Yes, mom. Are you gonna spank me? - Here stuff it! (soft jazz music) - [Rosie] Let me help you, princess. - [Ann] Yes, mother. Here take my pants. (soft jazz music) - [Rosie] You'll drive me crazy. - Let's rehearse. - What? - Let's rehearse the show. - You mean the party? - Right. - Yeah, tell me about it. - Act it out, the whole thing? - Yeah. - Well, you're the prince now. I come up to you and I stab you. - You stab me? Doesn't the countess do that? - Let me have some fun. - So you stab me. - Right. - And then what do you do? - Well then, let me see, what do I do after I've stabbed you? Uh. I could caress you and kiss you everywhere. You like it? - I do. Go on, tell me more. - What more could I do? - You're doing fine. - [Ann] I bring you right up to an orgasm and stab you again. (gentle music) - Pour me a drink and I'll keep you company. - [Martha] Shit, I was gonna close up. - Hello, can I still have a drink? - [Martha] Yeah, what'll it be? - Scotch. - Alright. Any special brand? - No. - Hey, you buy me a drink? - Of course. Order it. - Make it a scotch. You come awfully late. - I don't like it when there's people. - It's sad when it's empty. - It's always sad. There used to be a church here on this spot. - So, what's the difference? - Nothing. - Down the hatch. - Come with me. - Where to? - My place. - Will you be nice to me? - I'll be generous. - Where do you live? - Not far. Are you coming with me? - I won't be a minute. (suspenseful music) Quite a lair you've got. - [Mathis] Yeah, it's nice. - [Woman] You live here alone? - [Mathis] Most of the time. I inherited it from my parents. - [Woman] The only thing I inherited was misery and troubles. (suspenseful music) - [Mathis] Make yourself comfortable. - [Woman] Ah, oh yeah, that's comfortable. (woman sighing) (suspenseful music) (woman sighing) - Where were you? - Praying. I always pray before I do anything. I went to my shrine. - You got a shrine? - Yeah, I've got a shrine. I spend a great deal of my time there. You think it's funny, don't you? - No, but people who usually invite me to their place aren't exactly the praying kind. - Of course, you're a whore. - Oh, come on. - Yes, I suppose your customers aren't particularly concerned with your religion. - No, you're wrong about that. Just last month a man I know took me along to mass. - It goes to prove not everybody has forsaken God. - Well, maybe. Except it was a black mass. - [Mathis] Did you say a black mass? - Yes. An honest to goodness black mass. - [Mathis] So your friends procure stray souls for the fallen angel. - I don't know nothing about him. All I know is one day they invited me to a real weird party. - [Mathis] Where was it? - Just outside Paris in a castle. - What's it called? - I don't remember anymore. Oh, forget the castle and come on. Don't you want to fuck? - Are you in a hurry? - No, but if you want me to stay, let's see the money. - Don't worry about it. - Say the word, if you want me, I'll stay the whole night. - Alright. My mother died in this bed. - Now, what's wrong? - Nothing's wrong. Nothing's wrong! Take off your pants. Who did you go to the castle with? - With friends. - Who are they? - I don't know. He often comes to the club. - [Mathis] Which club is that? - The same club where you picked me up. - [Mathis] What's his name? - [Woman] I don't know. - [Mathis] His name! - [Woman] Pierre. - [Mathis] Who are the others? - One's Ann. - Ann and who else? - Rose. - Where was it? - Some count's house. - His name? - I don't know. - I want his name. I want all their names, you hear! - Count Diggins. - And what did you do? I want to know. (suspenseful music) Kiss this cross. Do it and atone for your sins. Kiss it. Again, kiss it to redeem your sins. Now, repeat. I'm a miserable sinner. - No. - You're damned forever more and can only be saved by the blade. - You're right. It's true, I'm a miserable sinner. - Now, repeat, I repent for all my obscene actions and thoughts. Say it. - I repent for all my obscene actions and thoughts. - You don't mean it! - Yes, I do! - Now, I want you to say, I accept the sentence of the Holy Inquisition. Say it. - I accept the sentence of the Holy Inquisition. (suspenseful music) - Ah! (suspenseful music) Ah! Please don't, please. - And the Lord said only the purifying blade could wash way Sodom's sin. Now, ask God's mercy upon your soul. - [Woman] Oh! (suspenseful music) (gentle music) - Good evening. - Good evening, your Grace. The actors have arrived. They're waiting for you. - Perfect. (gentle music) Oh, good evening, Andrew. Come in, friends. My dear, Angela, how are you? - Just fine. - And how are you? - Come on. - Oh, my dear old friend. - Your wife's here, Don. - Thank you. - [Count] Oh, it's a pleasure seeing you again. - Good evening, Count. - Oh, you look gorgeous. - Thank you. - How are you? - Hello, Pamela, how are you? - Fine, thank you. - [Count] Oh come in, come in. Oh Claude, nice to see you. - Ah! (suspenseful music) - What's best to repress my instincts or indulge them? What's best to live or conform to morals? Shall I give in to the desires of my body and its longing for blood and pain? Love and power? And the excitement of watching others suffer? (suspenseful music) Many of the great figures from the past, both men and women, experienced cruel pleasures and drew exhilarating thrills from them. They found supreme bliss in debasing young virgins, in torturing their victims with sublime refinement. Why should we deprive ourselves from the same pleasures, from the ultimate ecstasy of inflicting subtle pain, transcending tortures and death? Let us revere our bestial instincts which compel us on to violence and torture. (whip whacking) (woman moaning) Pagan spirit, spirit of life. Decadent spirit of the Caesars of ancient Rome, you showed us the way to the keenest pleasures of this world. We dedicate this ceremony to your memory. Grant us the privilege of enjoying the suffering we are now going to inflict. Oh, black spirit of darkness. Oh, spirit of night beyond life, we call upon your magical powers. We call upon you to give us power and the blessing of our pursuits, in thanks for which we shall sacrifice an innocent victim. May my arm not flinch when I raise it in your name. Bah, life giver, I invoke you and lift this blade in proof of thee. Spirit of evil, spirit of night, now give us bliss as my knife draws blood for you. (suspenseful music) Tonight, we pluck life away from a young virgin, beautiful and pure. Her life will seep out from the womb which is meant to give life. (suspenseful music) (woman screaming) (dramatic music) (sinister whispering) (lively jazz music) - [Count] Well, Monica, I see you're enjoying yourself. Hello, Jeanie, you seem to be having fun. - [Jeanie] I am. - [Woman] Come on, join us. Why are you all dressed up? Come on, off with your clothes. - [Count] Oh no, I won't let you tempt me. Not tonight. - [Woman] No, I want you to get undressed. Come on, join us. - Oh no. - Yes. - [Count] You know I stopped partaking in frolics. Enjoy yourself without me. - [Woman] I know what it is, you're ashamed to show yourself naked. - [Count] No, that's not it at all. - [Woman] Well then, prove it and join the fun. - [Count] Now, that's enough, I'll see you later. - [Woman] Alright. (lively jazz music) (somber music) - Raymond, Raymond, I need you. - I'm here to help you. - I want to confess. - I'm listening. - [Mathis] I'm the worst of sinners. - What did you do? - I'm guilty of the most abominable sin, several times over. - Which sin? - [Mathis] I took the lives of several human beings and I had no right to do it. - Why did you do that? - [Mathis] I wanted to save their souls, Raymond. I wanted to help them expiate on earth the guilt of their ugly sins. Women selling themselves for money. Women enticing men into the worst sins. I am deep in confusion, Raymond. I remember the generous injunction of our Lord. But I cannot forget the devil's words, not this countess and her Sodomite friends. I've been locked up for years, prisoner in an insane asylum. You must help me, Raymond. I ask you for God's pardon and your friendship in my hour of need so that I may help men from falling prey to their lowest instincts. - I cannot help you. - [Mathis] Why not? - You're a murderer. - [Mathis] Your clemency is as narrow minded as that of other men? - No, this is different. - [Mathis] You're a servant of God and God himself found it in his heart to forgive Magdalena. Give me absolution. - Do you repent for what you have done? - No. - You should! - Why should I repent, Raymond? My hand only obeyed God's wishes. - Don't expect me to give you absolution. I'll pray for you. - You must do it, Raymond. - You must repent! - For having helped those miserable souls rise to God? - [Raymond] Mathis, God said whomsoever judges shall be judged. So you refuse? - Yes! Then I must pursue all alone my holy, purifying mission so that God's lost children may be restored to his grace. - [Raymond] Mathis, in God's eyes you cannot set yourself up as a judge and even less as an exterminator. As long as you refuse to repent humbly and truly, I cannot give you absolution for your crimes. - [Mathis] Very well. - Mathis! Come back. Mathis! (dramatic music) (Mathis sobbing) (gentle music) - Good wine. - [Rosie] I have the impression the countess was quite satisfied with our services. - [Pierre] Fine, I'm glad. She spent good money. - Yes. She told me if she was happy, she'd call me soon and do another. - Same thing? - Yes. - That's nice. - She's fabulously rich. - I know. - But don't propose anything. Wait 'til she phones us. And don't say I talked to you. - Of course. Now, there's something you don't know. She already phoned and we've got a date. - When? - We're meeting for a drink. She wants me to publish her book. - Great. - Of course, it's quite a book. Probably a winner, even a bestseller. I want to publish it but it's a rough book and it's got to clear the board of censorship. - Ah. - It's like this fella who brought in a story based on murders. You know, those prostitute murders. The details are so real, the description is so accurate, I'm beginning to wonder about him. - You're afraid. - [Pierre] It takes more than that. - You know I thought you were the murderer for a change. - [Pierre] The Notre Dame killer? Maybe I am but don't you talk so loud. We're right across from the criminal courts. (gentle music) - Oh, pardon me. I thought Mr de Franval was in. - [Ann] Come in, I'm expecting him. - Thank you. I came to show you the remainder of the manuscript. I hoped you both liked the beginning. I'd like you to read this and give me your opinion. - Fine, I'll read it. - Did you like the start? - Of course, I did. - That's kind of you. I don't say that for myself but for the protagonist. I didn't make him up, you know. He's alive. I know him, he had a pretty rough life. You promise you're going to read it? - I will. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. (door clicking closed) - I'd like to thank you for the nice things you said about the play in your last issue. It's nice of you. - [Pierre] I meant every word of it. It's a fine play you wrote there. - Thank you. - I wonder if I may ask you a question. Where do you get your inspiration for the violence you write about in your novels and plays? - Death is a mask and its ways seldom look alike. Maybe all I write about is one of my own frustrations, inhibitions and fantasies? - You have everything a woman could wish for. - You can never have everything, Pierre. You know, some people are never satisfied with their fate whatever their fate is. Maybe that's the way I am, Pierre. I'd liked to have lived long ago, a couple of centuries back, or even right in the Middle Ages. - I see. - You know what I would have liked? To be the first count or the first countess of D'agon, a medieval prince. - You'd have spent half your life taking on some wild crusade. And, countess, worse, chastity belts, waiting atop a tower until your husband came back home. - You'd only see the bad side of it. There were great princesses and loving knights. - That's true. And virgins first slept with a lord on their wedding night. - Now, you're talking. - And you would have had slaves. - Which I would have whipped and I would have had the power of life and death. Yes, I would have been happy then. Maybe I would have been a queen like Catherine the Great or Lucrezia Borgia? - But you are. You are a queen today in your own right. - You may be right. See you soon, Pierre. - See you soon. - [Countess] 'Til next Friday. - [Pierre] Mr Vogel. You were listening. - Yes, yes, yes, I was. - [Pierre] Why? - Mr Franval, you belong to the kind which corrupt the earth and I hate you. You corrupt young women without considering the punishment they'll have to suffer when comes judgment day. - You can't be serious. - Of course, I am. You don't know what I'm talking about. - No, I don't. - But you'll soon know God's wrath. Believe me. - Oh man, that's far out. - You'll find out what I'm talking about soon. I'll see to it, you'll find out. God's wrath is upon you, man. Come Archangel purify the earth of sinners and chase away evil. The flames gushing from your sword will drive all sins back into hell and so free the earth. - My good man, you're mad. - No, I know it's the truth because the end of time's near. - Name? - Pierre de Franval. - Profession? - I am managing editor of Venus Press. We publish the Dagger and the Garter. - Huh, cultural magazine, I suppose? - You never read it, inspector? - No, I'm sorry but I hardly have time to read the daily paper, sports or social pages. - Yeah, I understand. I must admit our magazine doesn't devote much space to sports or the social affairs. - Now, Mr Franval, I asked you to come to see us because we need some information about a man you know named Mathis Le Forg. - Mathis Le Forg? No, I never heard of him. It's the first time I hear the name. - You're lying, Franval. We know you know him. He came to see you a couple of days ago. No point in denying it. - Skip it, Malou. The man we're interested in is also wanted by the Swiss police. Of course, you may consider that your profession prevents you from revealing sources. Yet I must ask you to think it over. Should you protect this Le Forg you may be charged with abetting a murder. You wouldn't like that. - Well, since you put it that way I'll do the best I can. I don't see any reason to refuse any information should it lead you to the murderer. I'll help. - We'll show you a few photos. Perhaps, you'll identify him. You never know. - If it can't be avoided, well, I'll do it. - Call in Hagens. - Hagens. - Will you take Mr Franval down to the lab? - Follow me. - Excuse me but would you mind telling me what this man is supposed to have done? - He could well be the Notre Dame killer. I'm sure that's the kind of stuff your magazine thrives on, right? - It would be a big story. That's exactly the way I feel about it too. Good night. Alright now. (gentle music) - [Woman] Are you sure your wife isn't coming back? - [Count] Yes, I am. Don't worry, my love. We have the whole night. You seem to be mad at me. You're so cold and distant, is anything the matter? - Are you sure you really wanna know what's wrong? - Yes. - Stop it, now! - Why do you say that? - You're nothing but an imbecile. An old idiot. - Oh yes, it's true. - You're a degenerate. - Yes, it's true. - Leave me alone, you freak! Come here and get down on your knees. - [Count] Yes, yes! - [Woman] Take my clothes off. - [Count] Yes, anything you say. You are right, I'm an old maniac, an old fool. - Stop, you creep! - No, never, no! - [Woman] Crawl, you worm! - [Count] Come, my darling. - [Woman] Get undressed! - [Count] No, don't ask me to do that. - [Woman] Get undressed, I said. - [Count] Yes, alright. - [Woman] Stay on the floor! You nauseate me. You're nothing but a filthy leech. Get back down and take off your pants! - [Count] Yes. - [Woman] Get on your feet now. - [Count] Oh, yes. - [Woman] Get up, you miserable old slug! Get into bed! - [Count] Yes, my love. (moaning) - [Woman] Goddammit, I'm going. You disgust me. - [Count] No, please don't go. Tell me again you hate me. (suspenseful music) - Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. I've come to deliver you. I came here to save your soul. I'm going to free you from your sins. Get up. Kneel. I want you to kneel before me. (woman screaming) (dramatic music) (footsteps echoing) - Martin! What do you want? - Think of your soul. Your soul's all that matters. I'm going to save it by plucking out its evil. - No! - Only then can it return to paradise. - You're mad! - You're afraid of dying? You're possessed by the devil. - No! - I'm going to exorcize him away. The Holy Inquisition comes-- - No! (Countess screaming) - [Mathis] Death is the reward for your iniquities. (somber music) (suspenseful music) - Hello Inspector, good morning. Damn shame, if you ask me. - Well, what else did you find out beside the fact that it's a damn shame? - Well, she's pretty. - Tell me now, doctor. You wouldn't be the murderer by any chance? - Huh! No, first I'd kill my wife. - [Inspector] Was she sexually aggressed? - [Doctor] No, he's a real gentleman. Stabbed her through and through. Didn't rape her. - [Inspector] At least we know he's not a sexual maniac. That's a big help. And no weapon? - Looks like he used a switchblade. He stabbed her like a maniac. The man's mad. A real butcher. - That maybe a clue. - He's out of his mind. He went at her with a vengeance. - Well-- - Just a moment, Inspector. The man who did it is obviously mad. I am sure it's the same man who killed the girl at Notre Dame. It seems the same knife was used, the same fury and the same apparent lack of motive links the two cases. I'd bet that they're both signed Mathis Le Forg. - You seem slightly obsessed by Le Forg. I think you're wrong. - I've been after Vogel for months and he's our man. Same way of stalking his victims, same senseless violence, same style. And same style means the same man. - Now, listen to me, Malou. You keep your ideas to yourself or I'll send you right back to Switzerland, do you read me? - Inspector, that tramp you pulled in last week says he wants to talk to you. - Inspector Malou as you can see every other man has got his own theory. But, in your case, you should know better. (gentle music) - Inspector, they went and killed my Napoleon this morning. - I thought he was dead. - No, it's my dog. - Oh, it's your dog. Well, you see this gentleman over here, tell him your story. - [Woman] Well, somebody killed my dog. - [Man] Did you read this? - [Officer] Did he have any enemies? - [Woman] Only this dog upstairs. - The killer of Notre Dame flaunts the police once more. The bastards are putting on the pressure just to drive up circulation. - [Man] Well, they're not altogether wrong. - They're what? - [Man] Well, you're not getting anywhere. That's a fact. - You're right. But I'm sure not going to take this kind of shit they're writing lying down. Goddamn press! Oh, Bartholo, I forgot all about you. - Between you and me, if they weren't such jerks, I'd come around here to keep warm. - You like police headquarters? - No, no. It's warm and peaceful here, that's all. I know who the killer is. I appreciate the fact that you let me out. - Oh, the police need a reason to hold a man. We had no proof. - No, another cop might have kept me here for months out of spite but you're fair and that's why I'm gonna help you. I'm gonna do you a favor and put you onto your man. Even bums have their use, Inspector. - Right, why do you wanna help? It's not like you to do that. - Just this once. - So you'd turn in a sidekick? - Never, he's no bum. He's some kind of a church freak. The man's a weirdo, some kind of a religious nut. I saw him come out of a church. - Come on! - [Bartholo] Ciao! - Marina's room was softly lit by a small bedside lamp. In the building across the street, a man stood at the window. Le Forg couldn't help seeing the girl. She was wearing the flimsiest of nightgowns and took it off provocatively as if she were trying to excite some imaginary onlooker. The dim light enhanced the sensuality of her gestures. There was something too deliberate about them. And, suddenly, Le Forg understood she knew he was watching her. That was why she was putting on an act, consciously trying to arouse him. For a moment, his desire for her vanquished the spiritual yearnings of his soul and the truth appeared to him beyond a doubt. The adorable body which was driving him mad with desire was an incarnation of the devil. Without even realizing it, he took the knife he always carried with him, walked out of his apartment. He'd been ordered by an unfathomable power to kill her. In a trance, he slowly walked up the stairs leading to her room. He stayed there a moment before her door and then knocked softly. The time for purifying vengeance had come. Huh! It's you! - [Mathis] Good evening. - Good evening. Is anything wrong? - I have to speak with you. - Come in then. - Don't be afraid. I don't want to have to kill you. But the devil uses you to lead God's creatures astray. You don't know what you're doing to me. You're the incarnation of the world's vices. - No! - I want you, I want you! (Ann sobbing) Please, shut up, shut up, shut up! - Let me go! - Shut up! Bitch! Ever since I saw you I wanted you! Don't move or you're dead. Don't move! - Inspector, I got a telex from Switzerland concerning Le Forg. - So what? - It's pretty important. He says Le Forg was a theology student and intended to become a priest. He went to seminary and then something happened. His ideas became extremely radical and he grew impossibly intolerant of others. Whatever ailed him grew worse and became an insane yearning for purity. Then one day he nearly killed a nun and was thrown out. Take a good look at this. - Mr Malou, now please, don't think I don't appreciate your fine theories but it's too late. We've already identified Le Forg, if you want to know. - Then what are you waiting for to go and arrest him? He lives right across the street from what's his name? This phony publisher's girlfriend. You know who I mean. - Yes, I know who you mean. But Le Forg's jumped the coop. - Ah, that means somebody else is going to be dead soon. I'd like to tackle this my own way, Inspector. - Suit yourself. If anybody asks for me, I'll be back tonight. Hey, Malou, wait up! (doorbell ringing) Open up, police. (doorbell ringing) Good evening. - [Rosie] Come in. - Ah, good evening, Inspector. - [Rosie] What can I do for you gentlemen? - Inspector Rochet, Inspector Malou. - How do you do? - There's a man called either Le Forg or Vogel who rented an apartment right across the street from you. - So? What's it to us? - Well, he's disappeared. No one's seen him around for the last couple of days or so. You didn't see him by any chance? - No. - I don't know him. Hey, Ann, this girlfriend who lives with me, she's also disappeared. - You mind some advice? You better forget about your little erotic games and just stay put for a short while. You see, four girls are dead and four's enough. - [Mathis] Ann, my love, confess your sins to me. You must sincerely repent. You are going to be judged by God's own court. I must, it's my duty. - Ah! Ah! Ah! - [Mathis] Don't scream! - Ah! (dramatic music) - Rose, take a look! - [Rosie] Did you call me? - Look at this. This is the new story that nut wrote. - [Rosie] Where did you find it? - Right here. - What's this about tortures and inquisitions and murders? - Will you publish me? - [Pierre] I was hoping you'd come round. - Well, I'm here. - It's about your story. - Are you going to print it? - We'll see about that. I am sure that you write about things that have happened to you, Mr Vogel. - [Mathis] What are you insinuating? That's preposterous! - We know you're responsible for these murders. You seem to know every detail. - It's not me. - Please excuse her, Ann's disappeared and we're terribly upset about it. - Your friend? She's disappeared? - Don't act so surprised! - You let her talk this way to me? You're both mad! Me, a murderer? You may have things you want to keep secret, not me. - You're talking about our parties, I presume? - Your parties, what parties? - Wild parties. You wanna join us. There'll be another mass at the usual place. Why don't you come and celebrate with us tonight, Mr Vogel? (dramatic music) (door rattling) - Ah! (suspenseful music) - Rochet! Rochet! You let him get away. I'm sure he's at the castle. - I couldn't do anything. He hit me from the back. Let's get him before it's too late. Oh, my head's in a mess. Oh! (suspenseful music) - [Pierre] Rose, careful! - [Rosie] Ah! (woman screaming) (siren blaring) - [Pierre] Inspector, it's Vogel, he killed Rose! He went that way towards the church. (dramatic music) (siren blaring) (dramatic organ music) - [Mathis] Raymond. - Mathis. What are you going to do? - [Mathis] They're after me, father. Protect me. - It's too late, Mathis. It's much too late. I've kept your dark secret, but I cannot help you. You have sinned against your fellow man and against God. And, by killing in his name, when God is love and charity and gave his life for you. Although I am yours now, my son, and face him in his wrath. - [Mathis] Goodbye, Raymond. (dramatic organ music) (somber music)
