Mmm. Excited to go see the lake, Cody? You get to see where Daddy proposed to Mommy. -No! No? You're lucky that's not what I said. Oh, did you get the sunblock that I asked for? -Huh? Sunscreen? Did you bring it down? -What do we need sunscreen for? What do we need sunscreen for? We're gonna be in the sun all day. "What do we need sunscreen for?" -When we were his age, we were out on the beach all day with nothing on. I have 16 millimeter films. We looked like lobsters. Don't end up like your dad. -Too late! Okay, so how long are you gonna be on that thing? -Uh, sweetie, this "thing" is allowing me to get away for the day. I'll be done in just one second, okay? -All right, fine then. Cody and I are gonna sing something. -Okay. What? What? -You win. Anything else. You don't like that? Why don't you sing something, Paul McCartney? -Okay. How about "In the Pines"? Really? No. No weird folk music. Weird folk music? Oh, uh-oh. Will you get his bear, babe? Yeah. I got it. No, he wants to sit right there. -Does he? What if he wants to snuggle? Why are you looking at me like that? -Like what? Like I've completely lost my mind. -You've been here for a long time. You know I would never use that phrase. Right. You'd probably sugarcoat it. Would it make you happy if I said like I'm having a psychotic break? I'm just trying to understand why you feel compelled to leave right now. I told you, because my brother has been taking care of my parents' estate since their death. I haven't been able to help him. I need to be there. It's time. And when was the last time that you talked to him? You know, that, ah, that is irrelevant. You know he's reclusive. You just have been making so much progress. Is four years really progress, Dr. Lanford? -Yes. These things take time. You know this. And money. Excuse me? I'm just saying, if my parents didn't have so much of it I probably wouldn't have been able to stay here for so long. So how much of my condition do you really care about? If you are suggesting that we have anything but your best interest at heart, that we would suggest you remain here simply to collect your money... -Okay. Okay. I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. -Megan, you are here voluntarily. You can of course leave whenever you'd like. But Megan... think about it first. Long and hard. I already have. Hey, it's Gary. You know what to do. Hey, it's me. I'm about an hour out. I miss the ocean... Anyways, I can't wait to see you. I'll see you soon. Bye. Hey, it's Gary. You know what to do. Hi. I'm here. Um, I don't see your car anywhere so I guess I'll just use the spare key - which I hope is still there, otherwise you're in big trouble. Anyways, call me back. Where are you? All right, bye. Gary!? Dammit, Gary. Please tell me you never fixed this. Ahh, yes. Hey, it's Gary. You know what to do. Hey, I'm in, no thanks to you. The key isn't where it usually is and luckily nobody ever fixed the back door so you definitely owe me. Jerk. Where are you? Call me back. -Catch me if you can. Get off me, Gary! Mom, tell Gary to stop kicking! -Gary, just eat your dinner. I didn't kick her. -Yes, you did. No, I didn't. -Yes, you did. Oh no, I didn't. -Yes, you did. No! I didn't... -Yes, you did! No, I didn't! -Yes, you did. No, I didn't... -Yes, you did. I definitely did not. -You did. No. -You did. That thing's not staying in the house. -It was passed down to me from my dad. It has to stay. -Well, you can keep it in the attic then. That's no place for Beethoven. How could you possibly put Beethoven in the attic? -In the attic! Julia! "Gary, working at The Pit tonight. Come by later for coffee and then maybe my place after my shift?" -Lisa. Way to go, Gary. Uhh.. Gary?! Hey, it's Gary. You know what to do. Hey, where the hell are you? This is getting weird. I just took a nap. I'm gonna unpack. Give me a call or hopefully I just see you soon. Hey, it's Gary. You know what to do. Hey. All right, enough already. You've taken it far enough. Where are you? Just call me back. Or else. Gary, working at The Pit tonight. Come by later for coffee. -Lisa. Just have a seat anywhere. -Okay. Hi. I'll just be right with you. You know what you want? Oh, uh, I just need a- actually, do you mind if I order from Lisa? Suit yourself. I don't usually get requests. Oh I think we have a mutual friend. He's not a friend, he's my brother. Gary Burke. I'm sorry, I don't think I know him. Gary Burke? Yeah, it doesn't ring a bell. I assumed you were seeing each other? Unless this Gary also goes by Jimmy and has been married to me for three years I don't think I know him. Uh, can I get you anything? Just a coffee. Hello? I don't need a lesson on what adjustable rates mean, Larry! I'm just telling you it's highway robbery. Yeah, I might be a humble public servant but I will sue your ass if you try for repossession. Hi. -Hi. Hey. Um, are you the sheriff? Yeah. Yeah, that's.. that's what they tell me. Uh, come on in. -Okay. Just, uh, open that door. Sorry to bother you so late. -Oh, not a problem. Megan Burke. -Megan Burke? Ah, Sidney and Gladys's daughter. Yeah, that's right. -Oh. Well, it's a damn shame about your folks. You know, going so close together. But with-with all due respect, you know, sometimes that's for the best. A couple like that, they don't want to live without each other. -Right. You knew my parents well, Sheriff..? Brunson. Sheriff Brunson. And yeah, yeah, of course. They kept to themselves quite a bit, as you know, but they were always plenty nice to me, yeah. Now what can I do for you? Well, I was supposed to meet my brother at our house this afternoon and he never showed up. At first I thought he was playing a trick on me, sounds silly saying it out loud, but... -No, nothin' silly about that. Not if you're concerned. Mm-hmm. Now unfortunately, there's nothing we can do about a missing persons until 48 hours, in case this is what this is. No, I wouldn't use that word. I wouldn't call him missing. I was just wondering if you had seen him around town recently. -Not sure if I have. Uh, do you have a picture? I'm sorry, what? A picture? Do you have a picture? I'm more than happy to look at it. I'm pretty good with faces. It comes with the territory. Of course. Um, I think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying. I'm just asking if you've seen my brother Gary Burke. I understand what you're saying, Miss Burke. I don't know what you want me to say. I'm assuming you know him... well. Why? Because he's been living with my parents for the past few months. He's been taking care of my dad ever since he got sick. Not as far as I know. Okay, wait. Here... Gary Burke. Oh. That's a nice lookin' young man, but.. no, doesn't look familiar. You're telling me you haven't seen him around town, with my dad, at their house? Miss Burke, until tonight, I didn't know your parents had a son. Okay, then who's been taking care of their place? The Andersons. The Andersons? -Eldon and Rita Anderson. It's an older couple. He had a garage down on Elm, she worked at the Cherry Pit Caf√©. Both retired. They do some odd jobs around town. I'd like to talk to them. Yeah, of course. Yeah, they live on Sycamore, last house on the left. Uh, but you can't go tonight. They, uh, they retire early, like most folks around here. All right. Uh, thank you for your time, Sheriff. -You should get some rest. You know, these things tend to make a lot more sense in the daylight. Right. Five hundredth time's the charm. Hey, it's Gary. You know what to do. Here's to sanity. Megan! Oh, you know who I am? -Of course. God, I heard enough about you from your parents. And of course your pictures were all over the house. Plus, and I know this is gonna be hard to believe, but I even remember you as a little girl. But come on in. I'm sure you have a bunch of questions for us. Come on. -Yeah. Come on, come on. Eldon. Eldon, get out here. Come on in, dear. -Okay. Oh, hi. Megan... -Yes. Nice to see you. -Nice to see you. Megan, please have a seat. -Okay. So how about some coffee or tea maybe? I mean, we have all sorts of flavors. -I'm okay. Thank you. Well, all right. First, uh, let me just tell you how sorry we are. They were very special people. -Oh, thank you so much. Um, so you two took care of their place after they passed? Yeah, well, we became close to your parents over the last few years. Our kids are long gone, uh, moved to the city years ago, so we all sort of bonded as empty nesters. -Aww.. Yeah, so it just seemed the neighborly thing to do to keep the place in order until you arrived to lay claim. Thank you. Um, so you must have been in touch with my brother. Uh, I'm sorry, your brother? Uh-huh. I don't believe we knew you had a brother. Um, Gary? My parents, they must have mentioned him? Um, no, I don't believe they did. Uh, I'm guessing he moved away years ago? No... No. He, um, he's been staying at the house for the last few months. You must have seen him. You must have seen his things? Uh, I'm sorry, uh, maybe you're mistaken? My parents, they told you where I've been the last few years? -Yeah. Uh, they told us. Okay. So you think that I'm completely nuts right now! -No. Uh, no, I just think you might be confused. I'm not, I'm not confused. I am not confused! Let me show you. No... No, no, no. No... No! It was all here, his clothes, his stuff, it was right here. It was right here! His books and-and his money and his.. what? -Honey... come sit down. Oh, my God. -Now let's just try to figure this thing out. Okay? -Wait... Wait, his voicemail. His voicemail. Look, I'll prove it to you. This is his voicemail. We're sorry. You have reached a number that has been disconnected No! Maybe we should call a doctor. No, I just need... please, please. Stop. I just need you to go. I just- Are you sure? Yes. I just need you to go. All right. Okay.. okay.. You're okay. You're okay. Hello? No... Oh, my God. Oh, God. Hello? Hello, ma'am, this is James from Harper Cruise Lines. Would you like to try an all-expenses paid trip to the Caribbean- I hope it's not too early for a drink. -Never too early in these parts. Plus, I don't judge, I just pour the drinks. What'll it be? Iced tea. On the house. Why? Because I don't get too many pretty non-alcoholic customers in here at 10 a.m. Thank you. You got a name? Megan. Duke. Nice to meet you. Pleasure. Is this where you ask what a girl like me is doing in a place like this? Uh-uh. Again, I just pour the drinks. What are you reading? Just a prop. Makes the clientele think I'm a lot smarter than I actually am. Sure the clientele's really curious. Mm-hmm. What is it? Victor Hugo... French literature. Completes the ruse. Hey, do you know a guy named Gary Burke? Gary Burke... Gary Burke? I don't believe I do. At least not by name. Why do you ask? Who's that? My brother. -Your brother? Mm-hmm. Megan Burke. That's me. Not married. I'm sorry, why do you, uh, why do you ask about your, uh, your brother? He lives here in town. Up in the house that's on the hill. You know the one? Yeah. Yeah, no, who doesn't know that house? Doesn't even really belong in these parts. I just thought maybe he'd come in here. He knows where to find a good drink... doesn't really like people. Well, half the town comes in here and the other half never have, never will. Oh. I suppose that's- Gary? You must think I'm completely insane. No... I mean, you don't strike me as somebody who's particularly nuts. At least not any more than the rest of us. You don't know me very well. Try me. There's got to be something. Okay. Okay. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You're imagining it. You're just - it's your imagination. You're imagining it. It is so nice to finally meet you, Megan. I got to know your parents quite well. I just wish it was under different circumstances, but that is one of the drawbacks to estate law. Right. Um, I'm a little embarrassed to admit this but the will, my family's estate, that wasn't something we ever discussed. Well, I'm not surprised. Few families talk about it.. until, well, they have to. Okay. -But the good news is that as far as these things go, it is all pretty straightforward. You are the sole beneficiary of the home and property. Sole beneficiary? Uh-huh. I'm not gonna lie to you, the paperwork can be a nightmare. Especially because, as you're aware, your parents had substantial monies. But don't worry, I will walk you through all of it. And of course it takes a while for these things to become official, filings and whatnot, but for all intents and purposes, the house is yours. Welcome back to Skillman's Bluff. Thank you. -You're welcome. So she was nothing but helpful? -And as nice as could be. But still, I felt there was something, some kind of... What, did you feel a chill? Like she was hiding something from me. -But she didn't say anything to, I don't know, indicate there were any problems with the estate? -No. Quite the contrary. She said the chain of ownership was very straightforward, there was some confusing paperwork but she would help me navigate that. Yeah, well, the more confusing, the more billable hours, right? Oh, I didn't realize how cynical you were. I've just dealt with my fair share of attorneys. Right. But it's weird she never mentioned your brother. No. And you didn't think to bring it up? Well, I did think about it, but she had ample opportunity to mention him, but she never did. Yeah, see, I've been thinking about this. Oh, you have? Well, in my spare time. Usually, I'm far too busy. But seriously though, I mean could your parents and your brother had some sort of, some sort of falling out? Not that I know of. But even if they had, they wouldn't just cut him out like that. My dad was a tough guy, it's how he became so successful, but he's not vindictive. Then I'm all out of ideas. Me, too. So... you're really gonna stay here? Why not? -Why not? I don't know, it just seems like Skillman's Bluff might be a little small town for you. You seem like someone who needs a little bit more excitement, sophistication. Oh. Really? What about you? This beach town isn't exactly a hot bed of French literature. I got my own reasons for staying. But you're really gonna stay? -I've lived here my whole life. I mean, I went away for college, had a few rough years... I spent my childhood here. It's some of the happiest memories of my life. I was hoping maybe I could recapture that. Does that sound crazy? No. Mm-mm. That sounds like one of the most sane things I've heard in a long time. You're sure it was a rattlesnake? -Yes. In the passenger seat. I don't see anything, Megan. What? Maybe it got out. You don't see it? -You're sure? Yes, it was right there in my passenger seat! -Okay. Someone tried to kill me. -Excuse me? Someone put a snake inside of my car. Who's this? It's Duke. Duke? Yeah, Duke. I'm the bartender over at Hubbard's. Oh Hubbard's, yeah. I think we've been called out there on numerous occasions. Anyway, uh, Megan was at the bar with me this morning when whoever put this snake in the car... What? I'm sorry.. what time was that? Just a little bit ago. I don't know, ten, ten-thirty. All right, so the two of you were drinking at 10:30 this morning. No, we weren't drinking. We were just at the bar. Oh. Go ahead. What we were doing at ten in the morning or ten at night is completely irrelevant. What is relevant is that somebody put a deadly snake in this woman's car. Actually, son, your state of mind at the time is completely relevant. Now look, a rattlesnake bite, that's no walk in the park, okay, I'll give that to you. But we get a handful of hikers that get tagged on the ankle every summer. Now we get them to the hospital in time and it's far from deadly. What difference does that make? Somebody clearly tried to hurt her. With a rattlesnake? You said rattlesnake, right? That's right. Yes. You want to guess how often we're called out to someone's house because a rattlesnake sees the AC dripping underneath a car? All they need is the size of a dime to slither their way inside. Now doesn't that sound like a more probable way that snake got in the car as opposed to someone put it there? Look, it's not the first time someone was out on a bender and- Hold on... Nobody was drinking! I told you that. No one was on a bender. -Sheriff, somebody is trying to kill me! Megan, I think we're done here. Let's go. I walked to my car and there was a snake on the driver's seat. Do you think it really slithered up there? Do you listen to anything anybody says when they walk into your door or do you sit there with your pomp- Megan... let's get out of here. Thanks for nothing. I don't know why you pulled me out of there. I was about to give him a piece of my mind. -That's why I pulled you out. It wouldn't have made a damn bit of difference anyhow, you saw how antagonistic he was the second we walked in. -Yeah, but why? I don't know. Was he like that the first time you met him? No. He was confused, he was unhelpful, but he wasn't hostile. I don't know... Let's get out of here. Got this little secret spot. -This is unbelievable. And it goes on forever. -This is amazing. When's the last time you were here? I guess like high school. And I went off to college and, you know. -And then what? Life. -Right. Yeah. What about you? Seems like a strange place to end up, I mean, unless of course you're in it for the literary scene. Uh, no, my dad was in the Guard, you know. -The Guard? Coast Guard. Yeah. We moved around a lot growing up. I never had a lot of friends so I kind of just always took to books. -That must have been hard. Not really. It's all I knew. I suppose it's the same for all military brats. -Yeah. I suppose. Uh, were you ever, were you ever married? Gettin' right to it. No. No, never. Close? Many times. Really? What happened? The "youzh" Okay. The "youzh". What about you? You don't want to know. Of course I do. -Really? Yeah. I was.. I was married. We had a son. Yeah. We were a perfect little family, if there ever was one. We were so happy. Cody, that's my son. Brian, my husband, he worked so much I always gave him such a hard time. The truth was, I was so proud of him. He was so driven. We had a rare day off and we were going up to a beautiful swimming hole up in Lake Farrington, up in the mountains. It's actually where Brian proposed to me. Yeah. I was driving because he had to catch up on some emails and I- I took my eyes off the road for a split second. Oh my, God. Yeah. Wow, Megan, I'm so sorry. It wasn't your fault. It was. I've come to terms with that. It absolutely was. It's been hard to cope with, but I've been in a treatment facility for the last few years. Any time I think I'm getting better, I'm not. You want to see a picture? That's Cody. Okay, Duke, tell me, where are we going? I told you, it's a secret. Can you at least tell me what you have planned? If I did, I'm afraid you won't want to come. What are we doing at the high school, Duke? -Getting proof. Please tell me you at least know the night janitor. -Come on. Okay, what now? -I wasn't always a bartender. What? Oh, God. Oh, God. -Come on. What are we doing? -You're taking a trip down memory lane. Oh, you know where we're going? -No. You're the one who went here. In the day time. -There. The library? -Bingo. What are we doing? The yearbook? Give me that. Give it to me. -What year we lookin' for? Where is it? It's gotta be here, it's gotta be here, gotta be here somewhere. Yearbooks... I found them. Okay, come on, come on. Yes. Yes! Hold this. He's gotta be... He has to be in here... Gary. I'm not crazy. -I never thought you were. That makes one of us. Well... I never kissed a criminal before. Just a little B & E. It's nothin'. I'd like you to come in. I really would. But...? But... Go on. Get out of here. Okay. What's this? -This is proof. Proof of what? Right there. Read it. Gary Burke. Right. Miss Burke, I don't know what you think or what you think you remember, but I never said your brother didn't exist. I just said I didn't know him. I didn't know your parents had a son. He went to Skillman's Bluff High School. He lived here in town. He lived with my parents! -Not since I've been sheriff. I'm sorry, you know what? I should have said "not that I'm aware of". Why are you doing this? -I'm not doing anything, Miss Burke. But I'm gonna be honest, I'm getting real sick and tired of your outbursts. I mean, you come chargin' in here with all these outlandish claims and all you did was bring me an old yearbook that shows your brother went to high school here once. I don't have time for my own problems, Miss Burke, let alone your manufactured ones. You're gonna be sorry. So what is it exactly that you're doing? I'm trying to see if any of Gary's high school teachers still live here in town. And if they do, I'm gonna go have a chat with them. Because whatever the sheriff is up to not everybody can be in on it. Look... Yep. Miss Ellen Snow. English Lit. And it says in the directory here that she still lives at the same address. Okay, maybe you want to give her a call first to make sure she's at least gonna be home? -No, definitely not. I-I don't want to give her warning. More importantly, I don't want her to call anyone. Maybe I should go with you in case something.. I don't know, just in case something happens? I want to surprise her, not scare her. Are you afraid I'm going to terrify this little old lady? No, I just think that I'll probably, you know, get more out of her woman to woman. Okay. But you let me know exactly what happens as soon as you meet with her. -Absolutely. I promise. I'll call you on the ride home. Uh, Miss Snow? -Yes? My name is Megan Burke. I was hoping that I could speak to you for a moment? -Well, um... Come in. Come in. Thank you. -Ohh.. Oh, here. Let me help you. -No, no, no. Sit down. Sit down. I've taught some of the toughest tenth graders you can imagine for almost 40 years, I think I can handle a tray of coffee. -Yes, absolutely. And believe me, that wasn't when students were shipped out and sent to juvenile hall for just a little horseplay. -Mmm. No. Those students were downright dangerous. -Wow. Not my brother, I hope. Hmm? Who was your brother? Gary Burke. Ohhh.. You knew him? Well, of course I know him. Oh! From high school. No. Well, maybe. I mean I might have had him in one of my classes, but no, I meant now. Uh, in town. But I haven't seen him in a little while. Is everything okay? Wh-when you say "lately", you've seen him recently, how recent? Oh, a few days now. You saw my brother a few days ago? About that. Yeah. I see him every day when he goes over to, um, my dear, maybe you should explain some of this to me. Um, thank you, Miss Snow. Oh, thank you for taking this time to speak with me and have.. for the coffee. Thank you. Oh, I wonder if she left something. Did you forget something? No... She knows him, Duke. She knows him. Wait, so she was his teacher? Yeah, no, yes, maybe. She knows him now from town... as in a few days ago. A few days ago? What the hell's going on? I have no idea. But something's going on and I don't know who's in on it or why but something is happening. I'm gonna go to that sheriff and I'm gonna tell him that someone from town knows my brother Gary! Mmm. I wouldn't, I wouldn't do that, Megan. Why? -Because we don't know what his game is. Look, I agree with you, there's something totally shady about that guy, I just don't think that we should let him know that we know that he's lying. I don't think that we should tip our hand just to prove that. Oh. You might be right. Of course I'm right. Okay. Yeah. So what now? Look, I'm almost done here. Why don't you go home, try to calm down and then after I'm done I'll come by and we can talk about what to do next. Okay.... Okay. I was gonna come to see you. Well, imagine that. What's wrong? Ellen Snow was just murdered. What? I just want to make sure you understand you can call a lawyer any time you want. Am I under arrest? -Uh no, we're just, we're just talking. Then I don't need a lawyer. -Yeah. Tell me what happened. Well, Miss Snow, she has a neighbor, Miss Hawkins, and she saw a young woman running out of her house. She thought that was a bit peculiar because Miss Snow doesn't get a lot of visitors so she wrote down the license plate of that car. Then, Miss Hawkins went over there to check on Ellen Snow, make sure she's okay. It's the neighborly thing to do. She got there and the door was open. She called out to her but nobody responded so she let herself in and she found Ellen Snow lying on the living room floor... dead. How? Well, the initial report suggests suffocation. But we'll know more when the autopsy comes back. That's awful. Yeah. You want to take a guess who that car is registered to? -Cut the crap, Sheriff. We both know that I went to visit Miss Snow today. I was probably also the last person to see her alive... besides the killer. "Besides the killer." I've got nothing to hide. I'm obviously being framed. Or-or someone was trying to shut her up. "Shut her up." Yeah! Huh. Miss Snow is a 76-year-old English teacher. Why would anyone want to shut her up? Because she knew my brother. She just saw him a few days ago. Miss Burke, what were you doing in Ellen Snow's home? I went there to talk to her about Gary! Why do you think she would know anything? Because she was a teacher in his high school. She still lives here in town. So tell me again everything she told you. She said she knew him. John Cavanaugh, was he with you? Who? No, you don't know his real name, do you? Your friend who calls himself Duke. Was he there? No... Why? Miss Burke, how well do you know John Cavanaugh? This-this Duke gentleman? Well enough. Yeah. Miss Burke, you're not leaving Skillman's Bluff any time soon, are you? You know I'm not. Well, that's good... That's real good. You're free to leave. Oh, my God. Hey, Megan, it's Duke. I've been calling you, but, uh, I couldn't reach you. Um, I even stopped by your house but you weren't there. So, uh, just call me. Hope everything's okay. Everything okay? What's wrong? What's your name? Your real name. You don't like Duke? I'm being serious. John... John Cavanaugh. Hell, I'd tell you my middle name, too, but it's a little embarrassing. Okay, just hear me out. I know this is going to sound so crazy. -Go on. I spent the day with Sheriff Brunson being interrogated. -I'm sorry, what? Ellen Snow... she was killed right after I left her. What are you talking about? What-I don't understand. -I don't either. But he hinted that he thinks that I had something to do with it. But he didn't arrest you? No, because he has no evidence. And because.. you're going to think I'm crazy. To tell you the truth, I'm starting to think this whole thing is pretty crazy. Please... Please tell me that I'm not. Megan, come on, what is goin' on? I think that Sheriff Brunson killed my brother. Killed your brother? -Yes. Him and the Andersons and- and maybe even the lawyer, Nancy... Nancy Allendale. Okay, come on, you gotta admit, that sounds kind of farfetched, don't you think? Yes, I do. Absolutely. But it's the only logical explanation here. How else can you explain all of this? You know that I have a brother. You saw the yearbook. Miss Snow said she saw him just a few days ago. Duke? Yeah, I know, I know, I know. I'm just thinking. Miss Snow, why would they kill her? Because she talked to me... because she knew too much, because she wouldn't play ball, she wouldn't go along with it. Come on, would they really kill her? If they would kill my brother, why not? Okay. If that's true, then why wouldn't they have just gotten rid of her like they did with your brother? It's faster, it's easier, it's safer for them. Why would they go through the motions of an entire investigation and try to pin it on you? Because a single male disappearing, that's not too unusual. It's very easily explained away. No one would really think anything about it. But a little old lady who never leaves her house, that's cause for suspicion. It's much easier to, uh, murder her and to pin it on someone with a motive. The big question though, why? Why you? The oldest motive in the world. Sex? Money. Money? How? My parents, they had a lot of it. So much so that I was actually quite self-conscious about it growing up. Do you have any idea what the house is worth? Or the estate for that matter? Quite a bit, I can imagine. There's no other family. With Gary gone, the entire estate goes to me. So what are you saying, now you think they're gonna come and kill you, too? No, I-I don't think that. I think that would be, that would be too suspicious. -What are you saying? I think they're gonna try to have me recommitted against my will. Hmm. You know, it's getting late. I think I should probably get going. I gotta open in the morning. Right... You don't want to spend the night with a nut case either. Megan, stop doing that. Stay. Oh, Duke. What are you doing? Me? What-what are you doing? I heard a noise. It woke me up. I just wanted to make sure no one was in the house. Okay. And? -No. Okay. Let's go back to bed. -Okay. We're not open yet, sweetheart. -Oh, uh, I'm just, uh, looking for, is Duke here? And you are? -A friend of his. Friend, huh? -Yeah. I thought he seemed a little more upbeat lately. I'm sorry, is he here? It's important. No, he's not here, but if you do find him before I do you can tell him he's fired. Pardon me? He was supposed to be here at eight. We had a big delivery coming down from the distributor. Most of our weekend stock. He was supposed to be here to accept it. You mean he hasn't been here at all today? I closed up yesterday. Just fell asleep around dawn. Then I'm woken up and I'm getting screamed at by a pissed off delivery man because he has a full run today. Let me tell you, he better not have gotten cold feet, little weasel. Cold feet? For what? -How good of friends were you? Duke was planning to buy this place from me. Yeah. Thought he could do more with it. Fix it up, bring in a different sort of customer I guess. Is this recently? He's been talking about it forever. Saving for a while. Problem was he was never able to secure the loan. He promised he was getting the money together but he always seemed kind of flaky. Do you know where his house is? House? Thought you were friends with him. Um... -Huh. Not that good I guess. Listen, pull out your phone. You'll want to GPS it. It's a little off the beaten path. Duke?! Hey, Duke? I need to talk to you. Duke? Oh no. Oh, my God. Gary... Oh, God. Oh no! Megan? Oh, my God, Oh, my God. 911, what's your emergency? Hello, please. I'm at the home of Duke, John Cavanaugh. I think he's going to try to kill me. Please come quickly. Yes, ma'am, I have officers on the way. -Megan? Megan? What the hell?! Get away from me. What the hell's the matter with you? -It was you! What are you talkin' about? What was me? You killed him. It was you the whole time. Who did I kill? You killed Gary, my brother! Megan? You're not well. Back up! Back up you son of a bitch! Put that down. I've been trying to help you. You can help me by.. you lying, murderous bastard, back up! I had nothing to do with your brother's disappearance. Then explain that. Explain what? Go look! Megan.. I had nothing to do with this. -Stop lying. It's right in front of you! And your computer, I saw what you were searching for! Megan... I can see how that looks. You have to believe me.. I had to make sure. Sure of what? -You said it yourself, it all sounded a little crazy. I had to make sure. I like you... a lot. I had to find out about you. Your brother... Tell it to the cops. It was Duke! He killed Gary! He killed him! That is not true. He's lying. I saw his body. You know what, Duke? I believe you. Oh my, God! What are you doing? No! This could have been so simple. But you made it complicated! It was you! You killed Gary. Yeah. Among others. Why? Why? Come on, Megan. You know why. The parents died. The son's missing. The daughter's in a looney bin. I don't gotta tell you what that estate is worth. Your parents are filthy rich! And they're.. they're arrogant. They never gave a dime to anyone in this town. Not their family. Not their neighbors. Not their friends. That's not true! They were good people. Oh, how the hell would you know? You weren't here. And this little windfall of cash is gonna go a long ways to handling my financial problems. What are you gonna do, kill me? Unless you got a better idea. You know, we kind of assumed you'd snap once your brother went missing. You turned out to be a little more resilient... thanks to this idiot. Stop! Someone's gonna talk. Someone's gonna talk. Someone's gonna say something. Who? Me? Nancy Allendale? The Andersons? We all have a huge windfall of money comin' our way. And nobody else remembers or cares about your deadbeat brother! Well, maybe Miss Snow, but I don't think she's gonna be talkin' any time soon. -What are you thinking? You're not gonna get away with this. Oh, once we tie up these loose ends it's really quite simple. The crazy, psychotic daughter comes back to town because the parents died. Well, that's easily corroborated, right? She meets an eager young suitor. They find out about the money and decide to keep it for themselves. So they kill Gary. They want to live happily ever after except for, oh, something goes wrong. It always does. And the sheriff shows up. Huh. That's me. After all, Megan, she called us. Right? And then we find out that Duke didn't only kill the brother, well, he killed Megan too. But luckily, the strong arm of the law shows up to put him down. Stop! Get the gun! Back up! Take it easy, sweetheart. You've never shot a gun before in your life. How bad is it? -I'll live. I'm so sorry. -I know. So this loan, you maybe want another investor? Of course you're going to need some serious rehab. And a fairly attentive nurse. Oh, yeah? You got someone in mind? One condition... We find you a new place to recover. You know some place? I might.
