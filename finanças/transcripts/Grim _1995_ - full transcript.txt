Shit, you're taking this all too seriously, it's over. - [Katie] It's coming! (blasting) (screaming) - [Reporter] Local news, as the house continues to collapse around Woodland Hills. Residents have taken matters into their own hands, and have brought in mining expert, Rob Colder, president of the Woodland Hills Tenants' Association. Trish Hannly says, "We're fed up with the lack of action "from our government officials. "If we prove that the mines run under the cave system, "the contractor will have to admit that he failed "to take necessary precautions." - Gotcha! (laughing) Oh, Rob, it is so good to see you! - It's good to see you, Penny. - Putting on a bit of weight there I see. What is this? - A little too much junk food. (barking) (laughs) You okay? - Yeah. - Good neighbors. - Come on, I'll show you the house. That's what I was telling you about. Wait till you see the inside. Want some coffee? I just put on a fresh pot. - Yeah, sure. - Check it out, it must really be sinking to make cracks like that. - Geez. This is serious. - Yeah, the garage is worse. The whole damn house is falling down, and the county accessors won't even come out and look at it. - Hey... (scoffs) Okay. - [Penny] The caves must run under here. I mean, there's no other explanation. - Unbelievable. - Still take your coffee black? - Yeah, thanks. I'll tell you one thing. He's sure enough to come runnin' if we do prove that the mines run out here. - [Rob] Hey. - I'm sorry. I know I'm gettin' all worked up, it's just things have been really tense around here lately. - I'm not surprised. - It's not just the subsidence, it's other things. Some weird stuff has been goin' on. - What do you mean? - Well, there have been some animal mutilations. - Neighborhood kids, that's all. - I don't think so, I think it's more serious than that. This is gonna sound crazy, but... People have been disappearing. (chuckles) They have, they've just vanished. - People don't just vanish. - I know. Oh, look, I guess I'm trying to say is that I'm... I'm really glad you're here. - Once we get in the caves, we'll figure it out. And that's what I'm here for. - Thanks. But... I don't wanna open up any old wounds, okay. - Okay. - Good. Come on, I'll show you your room. (bold instrumental music) (growling) - [Man Over TV] Today, we're spotlighting angry, ghetto couples. Let's meet Sheree and Odell. Odell says-- - Honey, where's my coffee? - [Man Over TV] Which affects their sex life. - Just a minute. - [Man Over TV] Odell is a lazy heroin and alcohol abuser. Let's bring them out. - What is that disgusting smell? - It's probably the drains again. (sighs) - God, this house is a lemon. (sniffling) - Man, what is that? (growling) (screaming) (dramatic instrumental music) (shuddering) (growling) (children shouting playfully) (pensive instrumental music) - Hey there. What's all the commotion about? - I dont know. Are you ready? I told Ken and Trish that we'd meet them down by the cave entrance. - Absolutely, are these the maps? - Yep. - Great, all the gears in the back of the truck, let's go. - Alright, let's do it. Hey, you made it. Rob, this is Ken. - Hey, how ya' doin'? - Great, great. - My wife, Trish. - Ah, I've heard so much about you. - Oh. - Yeah, remember I was telling you how Ken is on the county board. - Yeah, but we need somebody with your expertise to make 'em listen. - [Rob] Here you go. - Oh. - Nice gear. You know how to use it? - I could manage, thanks. Alright, let's go. - [Katie] We're ready, come on. - [Penny] Are you sure you guys still wanna go? - You betcha, we're part of the neighborhood. - Okay. Rob, this is Steve, and this is Katie. - Hi. - Here you go. - Whoa. - Easy. (laughs) - Sorry, thanks. - I can manage this. - You've done this before. - Actually, I used to do it all the time. - Do miners do it in the dark? - Oh, spare me. (laughing) - You okay? - Awe, shit. - What? - It's my sister. - [Steve] What's she doin' here? - I dont know. Sarah. - I'm going too. - But out, Sarah. - And leave her with you? Yeah, right. - One day I'm gonna-- - Hey, that's enough! Whatever your problem is, sort it out, or stay here. - We won't be any trouble. - You better not be. Or we'll turn back. (pensive music) Send Katie down. (pensive music) - [Penny] There you go, not bad. - [Ken] Nope. - Hey, be careful. - Steve! - Easy! - You okay? - That's it. (pensive music) - Fantastic. Fuckin' fantastic. (auspicious music) - [Rob] Come on, give me a hand. - Sure. - Okay, just take your time. - Okay. This is kind of spooky. - Oh, come on, we did worse things when we were kids at Halloween. (laughs) - I guess, okay. Alright. - That's it. - [Ken] Easy, honey, I got you. - [Trish] I'm okay. - Here we go. It's okay. Just one step in front of the other. - [Sarah] Careful. - Watch it, not too fast. - Alright. (suspenseful music) (weighty instrumental music) (gasping) (whimpering) - No! No! No! - How are you? - According to this, there are four tunnels. But none of them run under your homes. This one leads back to the surface, those other two look like dead ends. - So, we're wasting our time? - No, see this? Most of the rock here is creased limestone pitted with iron ore. - It's beautiful. - Yeah, a system like this always run deeper than what it shows on this map. Your builders should have known that. And there are no bats. - Bats? - Caves like these always have bats. - Which means the cave probably extends much further. - Yeah, that's right, come on. - [Trish] I'm worried, you said nothing about bats. - [Katie] Don't mind the bats, just follow the man. - Sarah, I told you it's not safe. - Then come with me, come on. - I can't, I gotta go find Wendy. - Katie don't be ridiculous! - There's something down here! I told you I saw it, it's calling me! - Do you really think Steve would be wandering down there if there was a monster on the lose? - He can control it. - Oh, grow up, Katie. He's all show. - Did it ever occur to you that you might be wrong? (weighty music) - What's she been sayin'? - She wants us to turn back. - We can't turn back. What about Wendy? - I know. We should tell someone, Steve. - Oh, sure. Look, we've been all through this. This is the only way. I've gotta get it out of my head. - Yeah. Yeah. - Come on. Come on. It'll be alright. I'll show you some nice rocks. (dramatic music) (screaming in the distance) (yelling) (growling) (dramatic instrumental music) (screaming in the distance) (dramatic instrumental music) (growling) (dramatic music) - Awe, man. Are we gonna be able to get through this? - I think so. Hey, cheer up, everything's gonna be alright. - So, what are we gonna do? - Blow it. Get back. - I've forgotten how much fun caves can be. - We'll have to come back here again. - Look, Rob, I dont know if we-- - It's a date. Everybody get back. Get down. (weighty music) - Get your head down! (suspenseful music) (blasting) (pensive music) (coughing) - [Rob] Is everyone alright? (coughing) Trish? - [Trish] Yeah, I'll be okay as soon as my ears stop ringing. - [Penny] I'll tell you, that is a lot of dust. (coughing) (gasping) - My shirt! - Like it matters. - [Steve] Look at this. Hey, Rob, get your light over here! (coughing) - [Ken] Honey, take a look at this. - [Penny] Isn't it amazing. - It's beautiful. What was that? Something's coming. - Is it him? (weighty music) (squeaking) (yelling) - [Rob] Calm down! (squeaking) (auspicious music) (clapping) - Hey, it's okay! - Very funny. (clapping) - You should see your faces. - Yeah. - I told you there'd be bats. (leery instrumental music) (shuddering) (screaming) - As the crow flies, we got about two miles to the houses. - How far is that as the bat flies? (laughing) You sure you gonna make it that far, Trish? Why don't you just treat it as a long shopping expedition? (laughing) - Oh, shut up! - Alright, let's go. Same order as before. - Oh, Trish, what are you doing? - Oh, just making sure we can find our way back. - This isn't Hansel and Gretel you know, honey. - I know that. - If it makes you feel better, you can use it, Trish. - It's not that I don't trust you. - It'll help us map this place later. - [Penny] It'll help us? - It's your fault Katie's into all this new age crap. - Whether you wanna believe it or not, there is something down here, and Katie conjured it up. And for your information, she was into the psychic shit long before I came along! - Yeah, well it was fun then, you're the one who twisted it all! (pensive music) (bold instrumental music) - Oh, shit. Here, babe, that's it. - Just follow the passage way. There you go, take it easy. - [Trish] There's my string there. - Okay. - [Ken] Thanks for the help. - Just follow the passage. - Have a swig. - Thanks. - So, we gettin' anywhere? - You bet. - Hey... Thanks. - It's gonna cost you. - Oh, don't, Rob. Don't start something you can't finish. - Can't a man make a mistake? - Not when he's messin' with someone else's life. - Penny. (dramatic instrumental music) (rumbling) (dramatic music) (screaming) (growling) (dramatic instrumental music) - What the hell was that? - [Penny] Rob? - I dont know. - [Trish] A rock fall, maybe. - [Steve] What's going on? - There's no air flow. We better head back and take a look, come on. Come on, now. - Come on. - Let's go. (pensive music) - [Rob] Everybody stay together. - [Katie] Alright, stay back, just in case. (pensive music) - [Rob] I guess that's why there's no air flow. (growling) - Ah, what the hell? - You brought the whole goddamn roof down. - [Rob] It's not possible, I don't see how this could've happened. I didn't use that much explosive for God's sake. It just doesn't make sense. - Are we trapped down here? - No, no, of course not. - Well, what are you gonna do now, hot shot? - Well, we can't move this thing, we'll have to find another way out. - Yeah, and what if there isn't one? - There'll be one, we just have to find it. - How long is that gonna take? - [Rob] Not too long. - [Ken] What are we gonna do about supplies? - [Rob] Well, we have supplies for about three days. - Three days? - [Rob] It's not gonna take that long, we always carry that much supplies. (choking) It's not the first time we've been down in a cave and needed anything. Anyway, don't worry. If we don't find a way out within the next 12 hours, someone will come and get us. - So, they know we're down here? - Of course, look, just relax. Rob knows what he's doing, okay? (choking) - [Katie] Steve, I'm scared. - [Steve] It's alright. It's okay. - Trish? Ah, where's Trish? (choking) Trish? She was right here! Trish! - [Rob] Watch your step. (choking) - Help. (choking) (growling) (dramatic instrumental music) (pensive music) (dramatic music) (screaming) - Damn, ah, my head. - [Katie] You okay? (dramatic instrumental music) - It feels like-- - What? - Oh, God. Oh, the pain is gone. We should leave that stupid bitch, Trish, down here. - Steve! - Well, we're runnin' out of time. We gotta find it. - Yeah, well what if it finds us first? It blocked the entrance, you know that. - Yeah, but I got his pendant. - And you're gonna rely on that. - You saw it hurt him before. - Steve, what are you planning? - To kill that motherfucker. Then we'll be done with him. - This is insane. I wanna go find Wendy. - Hey, you guys, what's goin' on? Is everything alright? - Well, what's it to you, blondie? (dramatic instrumental music) - Trish? - Wait. What the... - What is it? - A chair? - Oh my God, that's blood! - What the hell is a chair doin' down here? - I wanna get out of here. - I'm not leaving, not without Trish. - I say we should go. What do you say, let's go? - No! - Relax, no one's going! Not yet. - It's your fault we're in this mess! - Sarah! - I'm right aren't I! - We'll find a way out as soon as we find Trish. - We're trapped. - No, we're not. - That thing, that thing'll kill us. - What thing? - The monster for Christ's sake! - What? - Tell 'em, Katie, go on, tell 'em! - There's something down here! - What are you talking about? - Last week we had seance, and-- - Katie! (sobbing) - They have a right to know! - You think he's gonna believe you? - What is this, some sick joke? - See. - Alright, everybody just calm down. - I showed you-- - Rob, Rob, don't, please! - Alright, we're out of here. - Not without Trish! - Okay. Okay. We'll find Trish first. Come on. - Where in the world did this chair come from? - How the fuck should I know, come on. (pensive music) - Gotcha! - Idiot! (laughing) Just keep your hands off me. God, Rob, do you think she could be down there? - I'm gonna have to find out. Looks like we've come up to the old mining system again. - There's a light down there. - That's an optical illusion. Our lights reflecting off the water. - Probably. - [Rob] Here you go, around your waist. Okay, here. - Rob? You will be careful. (leery music) - What the... (leery music) Shit. (leery music) - [Penny] Rob, are you alright? - Yeah, I'm fine. - I'm coming down. (leery music) - Are we close? - I dont know. (pensive music) - What the hell is this? (leery music) This is unreal. (weighty music) - It's true. He's real. We gotta get out of here! Please. (leery music) - You go next, man. - Thanks. - Okay, snug? - Yeah. (pensive music) - Come on, babe, you're next. - [Ken] Oh my God, what is this place? - They found something. - I can feel it. - So can I. Reaching inside me. (leery music) - Tell me it isn't true. Just say it isn't true. - I'm sorry. - It's not possible. It doesn't make any sense. - Wow, it looks like the jokes on you, sister. - Cut the crap! - Man... Do you still think we're kiddin' you? I mean... Look at this place. There must be dozens of bodies down here. - [Ken] I hope to God Trish isn't down here. - [Rob] We'll find her. - [Steve] What does he do with them, eat 'em? - You're scaring the shit out of everyone, cut it out! (groaning) - Trish, we've gotta find Trish. - Can't you shut the fuck up about Trish? (dramatic music) (screaming) (sobbing) - No! (screaming) (growling) - Oh my God.

Poor Trish. (blasting) (screaming) (growling) - No! (dramatic music) (yelling) No! - [Ken] Help me! (screaming) - Come on, Penny. Penny!

Lights off. - What? - Save the batteries. - God, Trish and Ken, what's happening? - I dont know. - What is it? - I dont know! - Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Do you think that Katie and Sarah are... - Come on, come on, we have to find some help. (dramatic instrumental music) (weeping) - We have to fight him. The pendant can hurt him. He wants it back. That's why he's calling us. I can control him, Katie. Trust me. (sobbing) Cut it out! (sobbing) You know I would never hurt you. (growling) - Sarah. Sarah, wake up! Wake up, Sarah, please wake up. - Sarah, Sarah. Sarah, please wake up, Sarah, please.
