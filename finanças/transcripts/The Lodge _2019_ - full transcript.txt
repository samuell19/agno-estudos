Mia? Aiden? Mia? We have to go. Mia? Mia, let's go. Aiden? Aiden! Come on. - Just shake her hand. - How did you get an outfit - just like Mom? - Shake it. Shake her hand. You're lucky that can go right back in. Let me see if her head can go right back in. N-N-N-No, no, no. Not the head. Is she gonna be there? No. She's such a retard. Come on. - Hey. - Dad. Where have you been? Did you get lost? I miss you. Mwah. Come on. You, too, mister. Hey, listen, can you guys, uh, go to the store and get some candy? 'Cause Mom and I need to have a little talk, okay? Thanks. What-What's happening? - Candy. - And? No artificial colors, gelatins, or artificial sweeteners. Don't be long. Need a hand? Okay. You have a good drive over? Thanks for bringing 'em over. - She's not here. - Uh... You look nice. Tea? Coffee? Okay, I'll have coffee. Um... Well, we got instant. Sorry, 'cause I gave it up. Is that okay? You wanted to talk. Um, listen, um... I think we should finalize the divorce. Laura, we can't stay where we are. We have to... um... Okay. Grace and I are gonna get married. September. Okay. Laura. Laura? There is going to be more humidity around, and that's going to make it feel a little bit hotter and make it harder to cool off for your body. So we do have this heat advisory up for a lot of easternmost Massachusetts, away from the immediate coastline. And this is in effect till about... That sticky air is courtesy of the southwesterly wind flow here, and you can see the dew point temperatures are running in the low 70s. That's oppressive humidity down toward D.C., and some of that has climbed all the way up near the Canadian border. But as you go to the northwest, back towards the Great Lakes, see how these dew points drop into that refreshing category? That's going to get here for tomorrow. But first we'll have a frontal boundary across the area, and this front is gonna be a trigger, as we get into the afternoon, for a few thunderstorms. Now, the storm prediction center is eyeing that area for the potential that a few of these storms, uh, a marginal risk... ...and the primary concern would be for some potentially damaging winds. Also, with so much moisture... heavy rain, and there should be... ...that develop this afternoon as well. So, take a look at the timeline here on Futurecast... ...clouds are going to start to build, especially along... As we get deeper into the afternoon, though, that's when the storm starts to get going. 2:00 to 4:00 p.m., you can see a few... I don't know much. What I do know is this: she was a good woman. A very good woman. And she was always there for her family. Do not forget, birth and death are two doors through which we must all journey. All of us. Death, however, is but a new beginning, a new start. Therefore, let us all pray for her soul. Pray that she crosses over to where she needs to go. ♪ Nearer ♪ ♪ My God, to Thee ♪ ♪ Nearer ♪ ♪ To Thee ♪ ♪ E'en though... ♪ Okay, it's okay, shh... ♪ That raiseth me. ♪ She... she... she can't go to Heaven.

Did you plug it in? Hey, hang on a second. Mia, can you come here a minute? Okay, so... Grace is gonna be here in a second. And I just wanted to talk to you guys about something. How would you feel about going to the mountains again for Christmas? I thought you were working. Yeah, I am, but, uh, I'll drive you guys up after school's out, and then come back on the 25th. Are we gonna be there alone? No, I thought it'd be nice to ask Grace to come with us, and, you know, you can have some fun, get to know her a little better. No. No, you don't want to do that? - No. - How come? I'm not going anywhere with her, and... least of all on Christmas. - Why not? - Are you crazy? No, Aiden, I'm not crazy. Grace is part of my life, she's part of your life. - What? - And I think it's about time you guys got to know her. What do you mean? Okay, look. I'm gonna marry Grace. We... we wanted to tell you tonight. It's all her fault. I'm sorry? I said it's all her fault. What's her fault? What do you mean, what's her fault? What do you mean? You're talking about Mom? You left Mom for, for a psychopath. Who told you she was a psychopath? Hmm? She's in your books, right? Fuck you. Aiden. I'm really sorry, but we just can't do this right now. I'm gonna have to go out again later, okay? - What? - I was right. Grace is from his book on cults. Oh, my God. "Radical Christian sect." Everyone committed suicide except for her. She's supposed to bring the teachings of the sect to the public. Click there. And you will find salvation. Repent and you will wash away every sin that has been bothering you. Just confess. Repent and pray. Now, don't think I'm the only one watching. God is waiting. He's so impatient, and He can't wait to see your smiling faces. Please join with me.

She's a terrible cook, so you can eat what you want. You give it a chance? Hmm? Think about it? For me? There she is. It's the paper. I've got to take this. I'm sorry. Yeah. What? Well, I asked you to e-mail it to me. Well... can you do that? Hi, Aiden. Hi, Mia. Ready to go? Oh. Do you have the key? I got the key. Go pee, Grady. Go pee. I set up a little dog bed in the hall. A what? Dog bed. Is that okay? Okay. The bedrooms are upstairs. It's the last door on the right. Need a hand? No, I'm okay. There's your dog bed, Grady. Good boy. Look at your little skunk. You guys want a cookie before I finish this whole packet? Yeah. Take one for your brother. - I have three. - Okay. Okay. Here you go. Who's hungry? Dig in. Bless us, 0 Lord, and these, Thy gifts, which we are about to receive. - Amen. - Amen. What are you looking at? That's Laura's. Does it bother you? I'll take 'em down. It doesn't bother me. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Hmm? Shh, shh, shh. Shh. Stop. You're gonna make yourself bleed. - I'm sorry. - You'll make your nose bleed. - No, I'm okay. - Okay. - You good? - Yeah.

That's our mom's hat. Oh. I'm sorry, I... I didn't know. What happened? I didn't know it was their mom's hat. It's okay. Here. Take mine. Come on. Pull you? Yeah. That's way better. This is the way to do it. Mia? You okay? And... GRACE. Mia? Mia? Be careful. There's a fishing hole. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop, stop. Move back. You have to be careful. Stay here. I'll get it.

Get b... get back in the house. You're okay. You're okay. Please. Don't worry, you'll be warm soon. Here. It's really hot. You feeling okay? I'll make you something to eat. Hmm. Hey, it's me. Uh, listen, I can't come back tonight. Well, uh, can you get someone to cover for me? It's kind of an emergency. Mm-hmm. You okay? Mm-hmm. I don't think I should go to the city. Why? 'Cause I don't want to leave you here with the kids if you're not feeling... - up to it. - Uh, I'm feeling fine. It was my idea, and it's a couple days. I can do a couple days. - You sure? - Yeah. As long as I don't have to go ice-skating. Okay. You know what, come here. One, two, three, four, five. This is a family heirloom. Belonged to Laura's dad. You ever use one? Stand like this at arm's length, or you can use both hands. It's up to you. You cock the gun by pulling the hammer all the way back. Want to try? Come on, have a go. It's pretty easy. Okay, here, hold this. It's got quite a recoil, so put your weight in... Wow. Wow. Not bad. Now I can drive. Give me a kiss. I'm only gonna be gone a couple of days. Maybe I'll hitch a ride back with Santa Claus. What do you think? Hmm? Okay, guys, I'm off. Wendy from the gas station has a key if anything happens. The kids have their number. Remember what I told you. Be nice. Don't go hunting for your Christmas presents. Have fun. Bye! Love you, too! I-I was gonna start decorating the house if you guys want to help. Hello? Shit. Guys? What do you want for Christmas, Mia? A dog. I always wanted a dog for Christmas, and I never got one. Why? Uh... Well, I didn't... I didn't get presents when I was a little girl. And my-my dad was... really serious about the Bible, and it doesn't say anything about presents in the Bible. That's weird. It is weird. What kind of, um, dogs do you like? Bulldog. Bulldogs are cute. My dad doesn't want me to get a dog, either. He just thinks that I'm not gonna take care of it. Well, maybe if you take good care of your sea monkeys, then you can get a dog. I heard you can show your dad that you can take care of... Yeah. I got Grady for myself as a present to myself. - Hmm. - Whenever I... was able to sort of put all that behind me, and he was my new life. Do you want to see the present that we made for my dad? - Yeah. - Okay. Come down. Okay. Dad, watch! Dad, watch! - Hey. - That's great work, Dad. Mmm, this is good. We have turkey hats. Mm. What are you thankful for? Because Thanksgiving - is about being thankful. - Mm-mm, no. I'm thankful for my mom. We did good. We've done good. We never have real turkey on Thanksgiving, you know. Hmm. I'm gonna make something to eat if you're hungry, Aiden. Aiden? Hello? Grace, I can't find my doll. Did you look in your dad's room? Grace, I haven't taken her in there. And you only took her here and your room? Did you look in this... this room out here? The... the room, like, right here, by the staircase. I never take her in there. Okay. I'm gonna check in there. You want to come with me? Well, I'm gonna look in there. You want to look over there in the... by the shoe rack? You don't know till you check. Hmm. Oh, my gosh! Grady! What did you do? Did you think it was a toy? He must have thought it was a toy. Hey, it's me. Um, I don't know why it's going straight to voice mail, but I just got a missed call from you. Wanted to call you back, but everything's okay, and we're having fun. We just watched a movie. I made pancakes. Um... and we decorated the house with Christmas stuff. Try calling me back, um, or text me. Texting me is probably better. I love you. Goodbye. I'm making a sandwich, Aiden, if you want one. Aiden? Hmm? I'm making a sandwich if you want one. I'll make my own. I think we need to have a conversation, Aiden. What? I just feel like things are very... uncomfortable between us, and I... I just wanted to know if there's something I can do to make... make that better, or what-what your problem is. Hormones? Okay, I feel like there's something you're not saying to me, or... I just want you to know that I, I'm here if you want to talk to me about anything. Why would I talk to you? Because we're stuck in a house together. I didn't mean... I didn't mean “stuck." I meant, um, we're in a house together. I want to be in the hou... I mean... I didn't mean... I didn't mean that. I just meant... it would be a lot better, I think, for both of us if we could... talk. I don't want to talk to you. You don't want to talk to me? Okay. You don't want to talk to me. You just want to watch me in the shower. You don't have anything to say to me? I just wanted to try and make things better. Oh, come on. What were they doing flying that low, shooting at a dog? Cabin fever. Who knows? Go ahead. Go ahead. What are you waiting for? Grace. Is that for me? Yes. Thank you. It's really cold. Do you want some hot chocolate? No, thank you. Get your ass over here! Well, you feel okay. You want me to go get the gas heater? Yeah. Damn it, Childs, torch it! Is it safe to have that on in the house? Yeah, it's fine. It always sounds like that. Clear! - Clear! - Clear. You guys want to watch a different movie? It's Christmas! Merry Christmas, Dad! Mer... No! No! Aiden. Aiden? The power's out and the pipes are frozen. Can you check the generator? - Hmm. What time is it? - I don't know. My phone's dead. Check yours. Mine's dead, too. Where's the gas heater? Did you move it? - Aiden? - What? No. What is this? Where is everything? Did you do that? Is this some kind of joke? Grace! If this is some kind of joke, you got me, but it's not funny. Okay, I'm gonna go to my room, and when I come back down, all the food's gonna be back and so is everything else. Aiden! Mia! Where are my things? I need my pills. Where are my pills? We didn't do anything. You took my pills - and I want them back. - We didn't do anything. There's nobody else in the fucking house, Aiden. I don't know, maybe you should ask yourself. You're the one who's walking through the house all night long. What? We hear you every night. So I took my fucking pills? I'm gonna find my things. Starting with your room. Where is all your stuff? Grace. Stop. Well, if you tell me where my things are, then I'll stop. We didn't take anything. Where's my doll? Grady! Grady! Grady? Grady! Where's Grady? What if he's outside? How would he get outside? Grady! Grady! Grady! Grady! Grady! Grady! Grady! Grady! Grady! This fucking generator won't work. I don't know why. No power. How far is the nearest town? It's miles. And it's pointless without a car in the storms. The roads could be closed for days. I'm done. I didn't want to say anything in front of Mia, but, uh... I had a, a weird dream last night. Well, uh, a nightmare, but, um, in... in... in the dream, the gas heater started smoking and we couldn't breathe, and... uh, and... ...we suffocated. Did you mess with the clocks? No. Why? Grace. Grace. I've been playing with Aiden a lot. Yeah. Just sleeping a lot. Yeah, I miss you, too. Yeah. Okay. Your phone's working? It's-it's not working. - So give me your phone. - It's not working! So let me have your phone! I was just pretending. I really miss Dad. ♪ Nearer ♪ ♪ To Thee ♪ ♪ E'en though ♪ ♪ It be a cross ♪ ♪ That raiseth me. ♪ Repent. Repent your sins. What?
