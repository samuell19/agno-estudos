(MultiCom Jingle) (mysterious exotic music) - No. Please. (gasp) (thud) (train chugging) (whistle blowing) No, please. Please! (panicked breathing) - Get him! - Just get him, he'll be at the station. - Please. - He's getting away. - Do something, do something! (whistle blowing) (screaming) - It isn't. It can't be. - Dalby! Dalby, do something, please! The train is nearly at the station, do something! - There is nothing I can do. I'm sorry. - But, stop the train! Stop it! (bell tolling) (groans) - Too late for us. Too late. (grunting) - Dalby. - There is no stopping it now. (shatter) (distant conversation) (soft pleasant music) Never mind them, Auggie. They don't understand the magic. The power of model trains. - Yeah, I know. - And besides, today is your birthday. You mustn't let their childish games bother you. Not today! - Public embarrassment and complete humiliation bother me? - Ah come on, come on. Hey, Auggie. That's right. - Ah, I'm tied to the tracks! Damsel in distress! Ah, help! Help! Help me! Help me, somebody! Whoa! Okay lady, I got three words for you, weight loss set. - Thank you. Billy, I told you. Keep your hands off the train. - It just went off the track, August, I swear! - Hand it over. Poor thing just couldn't deal, so she threw herself in front of the train? - She couldn't afford lipo, and her plastic surgeon wouldn't cut her a break. - Man, you got a twisted sense of humor. - Or perhaps an overactive imagination? Billy, Billy. You and your stories. - What can I say? It's a gift. - Everything under control, Auggie, hm? - Yeah, sure, Mr. Dalby. No problem. - Good boy. (keys jingle) - Hey August. What do they do back there? - I don't know, inventory, I guess. - Inventory? They go in there all the time. How can there be that much inventory? - I don't know, ask them. - No way dude! Those two give me the creeps. - Ah, give 'em a break. The Dalbys are totally harmless. - I don't know. I think it's weird the way they go in there and lock the door like that. They've gotta be up to something. - All right, but you can't squeak a word of this to anybody, you hear me? - Yeah, yeah, I swear. - All right, they're in there counting the hands. - The what? - The hands. Jars and jars of 'em. Shelves full of 'em. - What hands? - The pickled hands of all the rugrats who messed with the trains. Psych! - Oh, you're not even funny. - Yeah, I had him going. But he deserved it! He's gonna end up getting me fired. That or break something that's gonna take me six months of working weekends to pay for. I guess when I was his age I was... Actually, nothing like him. Except for the fact that we both hung out in train stores. See, but I had the bug. That's when I started collecting. Why do you think I'm working here? Can you say employee discount? I almost couldn't believe it when Mr. Dalby, you know, my boss, hired me. He can be pretty intimidating sometimes, but, he's cool. Lately him and Mrs. Dalby have been making a big deal about my birthday. It's kinda like I'm their grandson. Billy's totally weirded out by them. Especially Mr. Dalby with that beard and accent and everything. I think Billy's got some serious Santa Claus issues he's gotta work out. (laughs) I don't mind him hanging around. In fact, I kinda like it. There's something about Billy I haven't told you yet. Remember that blonde? That total hottie walking down the sidewalk? You know, the one with the goon squad? That's Billy's sister. Hard to believe, I know. It's not like I have a chance with her. She probably sees me as her little brother's friend. But, you can always dream, right? So what's your sister doing tonight? She going to the movies? - I don't know. Why don't you ask her? - Oh, it's no big deal. - Look, I know Ellen rocks your world and all, but I'm telling you, she's just such a, such a... - A what? - A bathroom-hogging, remote-control-monopolizing cordless phone queen! Look, here comes her lameness now! - Hey you keep your mouth shut, Billy, not a word. - You're the man. - What's up Billy? You were supposed to be home an hour ago. Hi August. - Uh, hi! - So this is how you guys spend your Saturday afternoons? - Well, we were thinking about going to the mall, you know, suck down a few mocha smoothies. Shop for some lip gloss. Oh, and check out the dude potential. - Shut up, Billy. (slow instrumental music) This is kind of cute. It's neat how everything's all little and stuff. - [August] It's the HO scale. - [Ellen] The what? - It's train speak for little and stuff. - Do you guys rehearse this or are you just improvising? - Okay, sorry. It's the HO scale. Scale refers to the size of the model train. It's the proportion that the model bears to the actual prototype. The train it's modeled after. And then there's the gauge too, which, a lot of times people confuse with the scale, but the gauge is actually just the track size. It's the distance between the inside of one rail to the inside of the other rail. Well. I guess you should get the point. - You really know a lot about this, don't you? - Yeah. I was never into that whole muscle head He-Man type of thing. - What's that? - Oh, it's just fake. I mean, the track is real, but the wall is just a backdrop. It's a dead end. - Well, come on Billy, let's go. - Okay, but I think August wanted to ask you something. - What? - He wanted to know if you would go with him to the movies tonight. It's his birthday and he doesn't have a date. - It's your birthday? - Yeah, I guess. I mean, yeah, I'm 15. - What movie? - Uh, I don't know. Shakespeare in Rome's playing at The Plaza. - Ugh, total chick flick. What about Retro Puppet Master? - Oh, okay. That's playing at The Grand. - It starts at seven, so come by around 6:30. - See, was that so hard? - [Ellen and August] Shut up, Billy. - Come on. (train rattling) - Yes! (rattling) (click) Oh hey, I was just locking up. - You can't leave without your birthday surprise, now can you? - Uh. I guess I got some time. What's in it? - Open and see. (mysterious music) - Cool. It's, uh it's a key, right? - Indeed it is, my boy. Indeed it is. A very special key. - What's it, I mean... - What does it open? - Yeah. - Come and see. That shed there, slide it back. Easy, easy. There is your answer. - What's it for? - Try it and see. (key clicking) - Whoa! Where do they go? - That, my boy, is a real surprise. (keys jingle) (click) - [August] Mr. Dalby... - Nothing to fear. (click) - Wow, it's incredible. - Indeed it is, my boy. It is my night village. A world I have chosen to share with you. Let me show you the train that goes with it. - The train? - A very special train. A train that is equal in splendor to the world through which it travels. (mysterious exotic music) Baggage car. Coach. Another coach. And here is the locomotive and tender. - But it's so strange. I've never seen it in any of the catalogs. - It's one of a kind. - [August] Landros. - Pavel Landros, a remarkable craftsman. This set represents his life work. And all of him that survives is here. But, what is a train without passengers and crew, eh? - Cool. Did Landros do the figures too? - He did. - [August] There's three missing. - Yes. Those three are lost. One permanently, I'm afraid. - What about the other two? - Those two? Well, they are safe for now and some day soon, if all goes well, they'll be reunited with the six free men. But come. We must place them. Our businessman goes here, travelling alone. The young mother, here. Next, the little girl. She's a handful, this one, so, we must seat her next to her mother. The engineer, of course, in his cab. And the conductor, here in the baggage car. And that leaves only one. Take him. - Where does he go? - The boy goes in the station. Today is a special day for him, like it is for you. His journey is about to begin. And now you must make it run. It is time. - What's that clock thing? - Oh. (watch beeps) - Oh no. I gotta go. I was supposed to meet Ellen. I'm sorry Mr. Dalby, it's... I mean, it's the coolest layout, but... - No no, no need to explain, my boy. Go on and have your fun tonight. The key is yours now, and the night village will be waiting. - Thanks Mr. Dalby. (door shuts) (keys jingle) (click) - He has the key now. He'll be back, you'll see. Goodnight, Mrs. Dalby. - Goodnight, Mr. Dalby. (mysterious music) - You know, you really surprised me tonight. - Oh. I always eat two chili-cheese dogs when I go to the movies. - No, not that. It's just that Billy says that you're like the man when it comes to the whole toy train thing, and you haven't even mentioned them. - It's model trains. But it's not really a kid thing. I mean, it's more of a passion. I mean, you like movies, right? - Yeah, majorly. - So when you go to the movies and the lights go down, and you slip into another world. I mean, everything just disappears for two hours. School, parents. Annoying little brother. None of them exist. - Actually, Retro Puppet Master didn't do it for me, but I know what you mean. And that's what model trains do for you? - Yeah. Except I leave the lights on. Do you wanna see? - Now? - Why not? - Okay, why not? I know, I know. What was I thinking, right? Like how many times have we heard that old line? Do you wanna go see? Please. He's cute. And I bet you a tub of that jumbo popcorn he's harmless. He's probably more into those choo-choo trains than girls anyway. And he did say the lights would be on. Plus, he's barely 15, and I've been 16 like for four months already. I even dated a guy that was 17. I mean, it was only like for three weeks or whatever, but still. I just think it was cool that August knew I liked movies and the way they make me feel. I mean, that's not like something I've ever even talked to a guy about before. I mean, that 17-year-old guy, he was a jock and a total stud but he was always grunting and flexing. You take him out of the gym or off the football field, and he's just clueless. And August is... Different. In that doe-eyed sensitive kind of way. Ugh, but he is Billy's friend, and Billy is a total infant, if you ask me. You probably think I'm robbing the cradle, right? But it's not like they're best friends. I mean, Billy's not gonna have him spend the night at our house or anything. Please! - It's okay. (keys jingle) (click) Follow me. - Where are we going? - The back room. - The back room? You're not gonna show me my brother's hand in a jar, are you? - Trust me. - [Ellen] Okay. I can't see anything. - [August] Yeah, it'll take me a second to find the light, hold on. - [Ellen] Is this how you train guys pick up girls? - [August] Something like that. (click) - Check it out. It's beautiful! - See, this is someone's dream of a better world, where everything and everyone is good, you know? And right, it's perfect here. The way you could only dream it. Sometimes, sometimes I just wish the world away. Forget about all the cliches and the jerks and things that are supposed to be cool and uncool. Forget about the speech. You wanna run the train? - Let me help. (click) (train chugging) (whistle blowing) So, tell me about the girls in your perfect world. - The girls? I don't know, never been there before. (wind blowing) (electricity zapping) (bell tolling) (train chugging) - Is it them? - [Mr. Dalby and Mrs. Dalby] The back room! - Joseph! It is just as I said. Young August could not resist. He could not stay away. (labored breathing) Yes Joseph, it is difficult at first, until you learn to breathe. And you are going to breathe in so much more. Young boy, there is so much more to give you. There. You see, Joseph? It has begun. Forget your troubles. The transformation begins. (bell tolling) - Tickets. Tickets please. Tickets, tickets please. Ticket please. - I don't... - [Conductor] Ticket please! - I'm sorry, I don't know what's going on, but, I have no ticket. - No ticket. No stops. Tickets, tickets please. Tickets. Tickets please. Tickets. (whistle blowing) - Excuse me, lady? Hey lady, can you hear me? I guess not. I guess I'll only eat one chili-cheese dog from now on. Wait a minute. - [Mr. Dalby] But, what is a train without passengers and crew? Our business man goes here. Travelling alone. The young mother. - No, it can't be. Wait, there's no little girl. There's supposed to be a little girl next to her mother. There is no way. (bell tolling) (groans) - [Voiceover] Are you a stowaway then? - What? - Well you're on the train without a ticket, aren't you? - You. Everything seems so real. - Yeah, it's real all right. - Right. I'm on a model train with plastic passengers. Man, I hope I remember this when I wake up. (thud) Ow! - Are you awake now, Auggie? Are you? - Auggie? How do you know my-- - [Ellen] August? - Ellen? Ellen, where are you? (whistle blowing) - Hi. - You okay? - Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. But where are we? - Are you awake? Do you feel like you're awake? - Of course I'm awake. - I was afraid you were gonna say that. - Well, I don't know what to make of it. What will we do with the two of them? - It's against code. There are procedures that must be followed, standards to keep. It's bad for business, I say. Bad for business. - Ellen. It sounds like a girl's name to me. Yeah, yeah, I'm positive. It is a girl's name, I bet my life on it. - Just what do you think you're up to? - I'll never tell. - We're on the train. I don't know how, but, I think we're on the train. (scoffs) - Did you figure that out all by yourself? - You don't get it. I mean, I don't get it either, but, I think we're on the train. The train in the back room of the store. - The, the toy train? - Model train. But yeah, I think so. - August, reality? (whistle blowing) (whispering) Wait, who are those people down there? - They're the figures. The passengers. - The who? - All right, the toys. They're the toy people who ride the train. - But August, they're as big as we are. - Or, I think we're as small as they are. - I take it back. I don't think I'm awake after all. - Look, look, look everyone! It's Joseph! He's made it. The ritual is working. - Now it's up to us. We cannot let anything go wrong this time. - Well I think something has gone wrong. There's either one too many of them, or one too many of us. - Oh no you don't. - Well she is a girl. And I'm a girl... - I say leave the girl out of it. It's the boy who's important. We cannot let him out of our sight. - Besides darling, if the girl were part of the ritual, I would take her place at the station. - You? Look, the girl's here for me! Look at her, she's not a mother. - Yes, but I'm the next in the box. - Confound it. If she were part of the ritual, one of you would have been placed at the station. It's Joseph's turn now. We must stick to the plan! - What are they talking about? - I don't know. - August. - [August] Yeah? - I think I want you to take me home now. - I'll try. - I know that's not part of the plan! - Ellen, wait! There's still so much time. (wind rushing) - What are we gonna do? - We gotta climb the train, I mean, there's nowhere else to go. (suspenseful music) Come on. - [Ellen] Hey you! - Hmm? - Let me see your license and registration. - What? Who are you? (gasp) - If none of these work, we're in serious trouble. - (mumbles) we're in for a disaster. It's working! It's working, keep pulling it! (creak) (groaning) - You heard the conductor. No tickets, no stops! (grunting) - Look out! - If he stops the train, we'll lose Joseph. - Oh yes. - [August] We gotta jump. (groaning) - So this is the perfect world I've heard so much about? - Yeah, I guess I deserve that. - What is going on, August? I'm starting to feel like Alice in Wonderland. - I don't know. I mean, we were in the back room, and, I was just gonna run the train for you. - And I put my hand on your hand. - Right, and, we were both touching the transformer and... - What? And what? - Billy was right. - Oh, that's a comfort. - Billy's always saying that the Dalbys are up to something. You know, the way that they're always going back there and locking that door? And just today, Mr. Dalby said it was my special day. He tried to get me to run the train. Just like... - What, just like what? - Just like that boy in the train station. Dalby said his journey was about to begin. - So? - So he's not there anymore. His chair was empty. - He probably bailed, August. He went off to terrorize some other shrunken little kid somewhere. - I don't think so. - You think that's who we saw in the sky, that boy's face? - Yeah, they called him Joseph, but I don't think he's in the sky. I think he's in the back room. He's up there in our world and I'm stuck down here in his. - We're both stuck down here. And I don't know about you, but I'm ready to call it a night. - (sigh) Let's go stop the train. - But I thought if we stopped the train they lose Joseph. - Exactly. Exactly. Like I know what I'm talking about. I'm out with one of the hottest babes in my school. And I was impressing her. I know I was. And then, this. (sigh) I better start thinking fast or she's never gonna want to go out with me again. Okay, remember that box? The ones with the figures in it? Okay, there was three missing. Do you remember what Mr. Dalby said to me when I asked him about it? "Yes, three are lost. "One permanently, I'm afraid." See what I'm getting at here? What if the one that's lost is like this Joseph dude? Only then they lost him somehow because, someone or something stopped the train? Now I don't know if it's gonna help if they lose Joseph, but, it can't hurt. Can it? (mysterious music) (bell tolling) (gasp) (faint creaking) Ow! - [Ellen] What is it? Are you okay? - Yeah, it's my leg. (electricity crackling) There it is. - [Ellen] What's that? - The transformer. Come on. Well, this is a problem. - [Ellen] Okay, now what? - I don't know, even if we could get up there, there's no way we could move that control. - What about those screws? Maybe we can get those loose. - Stay away from those screws. At your size they'll fry you. - Oh, and you're not that big yourself, you know? - Look, you know what I mean. - Well if we can't disconnect these wires and we can't climb up there, then-- - We'll short it out! - We'll what? - [August] We'll just find something metal and we can lay it across the two screws and we'll short it out! (ominous music) - Uh, August? August! (blowing) - Let's get out of here! - Dalby! Dalby! - What is it, Joseph? - They've escaped. - Joseph, what have you done? - They've escaped the train. They were here at the transformer, trying to destroy me. - What do you mean, they? - There were two of them, Dalby. They escaped into the trees. (rapid breathing) - Are you okay, August? - Yeah. The train's coming. - Come on, let's go. - Wait a second. - We've got to find them. We must find them at once. - Mr. Dalby? - Not now, Mrs. Dalby. There! - Come on, we can do it. - What are they doing? - They're putting something on the tracks. - Mr. Dalby-- - [Joseph] Dalby, do something! (beeping) - A little bit more. - Here it comes. (Ellen shrieks) (whistle blowing) That was close. - Come on, help me. - It's too close. - Come on, push. (whistle blowing) - And now I have to get them back on the train. - Mr. Dalby. - Not now, Mrs. Dalby. Can't you see that I am busy? - It's the police, Mr. Dalby. - Joseph, don't touch a thing. Do you understand me? - But now is the time, Dalby. We can find him easily. - There is plenty of time. We'll find him. Now, as I said, don't touch a thing. (August sighs) - Well that was a bust. - And I know where we are now. We'd better get going. And we'd better hurry. (music box melody) Wait, do you hear that? - No, what is it? - It sounds like music. Do you hear it? - Yeah. Where's it coming from? - Well maybe there's somebody there that can help us. - Well Mr. Dalby only had one set of figures and they're on the train. - Are you sure? - Pretty sure. - How can I help the police this morning? - Sorry to disturb you so early, Mr. Dalby. I'm Detective Thomaso. This is Detective Wilson. - Uh, Mr. Dalby, do you know this boy? - Of course. He's my Auggie. But you have made a mistake. You have the wrong boy. - Pardon me? - I mean, Auggie's a good boy, the best help I've ever had. Whatever has happened, I can assure you Auggie had nothing to do with it. - Mr. Dalby, Auggie didn't come home last night. He's missing. - What? - When did you last see Auggie? - Just last night. It was his birthday and I surprised him with a remarkable train layout. It's in the back room, detectives. Would you like to see it? - That won't be necessary. Do you recall what time he left here last night, Mr. Dalby? - Well, uh, nearly 6:30. He was running late for... - He was running late for what, Mr. Dalby? - For a date. Of course, for a date with Ellen. A lovely girl, beautiful girl. (laughs) Why not? Auggie's a handsome boy, is he not? (music box melody) - What is this place? - It's brilliant. - We appreciate your business. Have a wonderful day. - Who said that? - We appreciate your business. - Are they gonna come to life and like pelt us with loaves of bread? - Nah, it's just an animation. It's on a continuous loop. We sell them at the store. - We appreciate your business. - Buddy, if you only knew... It's some party. Happy birthday, August. - Yeah. Thanks. (Ellen chuckles) What? - Nothing. - What? - Nothing. It's just, you were so aggressive back there and I thought you weren't really into that He-Man muscle head thing. - I break it out occasionally. - Oh you do? - Well whenever there's a damsel in distress around. - Don't even go there. - Sorry, I couldn't resist. - So, you haven't told me what the girls are like in your perfect world. - I didn't? Well um... They're really into movies. Even really bad horror movies. - Uh-huh, go on. - And uh, they have a weakness for younger guys. Just a little younger. - That sounds more like fantasy. - Well, you know. Maybe a birthday wish? (distant voice) - Wait, did you hear something? - What? - I think it came from over there. Hey, look at that. A jailhouse in a perfect world. - Yeah, I haven't met anybody I didn't want to lock up. - [Voiceover] We're over here. In here. - Did you hear that? - [Voiceover] We're over here. In here. - Somebody's expecting a jailbreak. It's just another loop. - No, I think it was different that time. - [Voiceover] We're over here. In here. - Trust me, it's the same. Remember, I'm the train guy. - [Voiceover] In here, children. We're in here. - Did she just say children? - Oh, well maybe no one told her it was your birthday. (Ellen laughs) (creak) - In here. We're in here. Oh. You found us. Oh joy. You see Landros, I told you someone would come. - Landros? You're Pavel Landros? - I'm afraid I am. - Oh, but don't blame him, children. He didn't mean for this to happen. I was having a train repaired for my grandson. It wasn't Landros's fault. - Shh, that's, that's-- - [Mrs. Ellerbee] It wasn't his-- - That's enough, Mrs. Ellerbee. - Blame you for what? Who are you? - I am the creator, my dear. The train, the figures, this place you find yourself trapped in, all of it is my doing, and all of it is my fault. - Well great. We'll just set you free and then you can help us get out of here. I mean, you can do that, right? - Hmph. - Tell them about the exit knife, Landros. - Can you get us out of here? - I am an old man, and I'm weak. - Wait, how can this be your fault? I mean, Mr. Dalby's the one that did this to us. He's the one that tried to get me to run the train. - Dalby does as Dalby must do. He knows nothing of what it is to choose. I chose for him, by opening that door. I chose for all of them. - I don't understand. - In the real world I was an outsider, alone, embittered, and only in the company of my trains did I feel whole and safe. So I became obsessed, obsessed with my beloved trains, for they existed in a world of my creation. - A perfect world. - Yes, perfect. Or so I thought. So I traveled. I traveled the world in search of sacred texts, hungry for the secrets of ancient civilizations, thirsting for any knowledge that would open the door and grant me passage into this world. And then suddenly I found it. I found the spell that opened the door. But something went wrong. Terribly wrong. - Thanks, I wasn't aware. - Yeah. By opening the door to this world, I unwittingly opened the door to another. My precious figures, so lovingly crafted, became possessed by supernatural spirits. They know nothing of, of where they come from, nor did they know anything of the real world, but, they lust for it. And just as I desperately covered this world, they desperately covet yours. - So Mr. Dalby and Mrs. Dalby were just-- - They were toys, August, just like Joseph is a toy, and now he's becoming real because he's stealing your life. I mean, how could you do this to him? - Ellen, don't. - Why August? I mean, why him? - Tell me young man, how old are you? - I'm, I'm 15. - He's 15 today. So what? - Then Dalby wasted no time at all. When I crafted Joseph, I imagined him a 15-year-old, a young man on the brink of excitement and discovery. That was my Joseph. About to embark on the journey of a lifetime. - All right, cut. This is all very moving, almost convincing, but I'm not a fan of melodrama, and I'm sorry life dealt you a bad hand or whatever, but I happen to like the world out there. I want to get back to it. We both do. So if you can't help us, then we'll be going now. - Wait. We can't just leave them here. What is the exit knife? - She's right. You must go. They will be searching for you, and they will not stop until they get you back on that train. - Tell them, Landros. - Just tell us already. - It's an X-Acto knife. It's over there in the corner. I broke it when I was constructing the jailers. It was a bit sloppy of me, I'm afraid. Shh. That's Dalby. He's searching for you. You are not safe here now. - [Ellen] Let's go. Listen to him. - No, wait. This is just wood. These are just pieces of wood. I can get you guys out of here. - There isn't time. You must go now. - [Ellen] Tell us how to stop the train. - Never mind about the train. Go nowhere near it. - But I thought if we stopped the train, the ritual would fail. - Yes, but the ritual will also fail if you're not on the train during the final revolution. - What do you mean, the final revolution? - That's the final lap. The door between this world and your world will be open only for one year. - A year? - Yes, but not a year as you know it. A year here is marked by a trip around the land, each day marked by a trip past the station, and it's signaled by the tower clock. If the two of you are on the train, the door between this world and your world will be closed forever. - Yeah, but Ellen's not changing. She has no part of this. - But she's here now 'cause she accompanied you here, and-- - Let's go, August. Let's get out of here. - Wait, I can get this. - No, you must go with her now, quickly. - It's an amazing train. I've never seen anything like it. - It's only a model train, young man. It's only a model. (creak) (suspenseful music) - Let's go. (music box melody) - Where have they gone, Dalby? You've lost them. You've lost them! - Mrs. Dalby, the light, quickly. - Yes, Mr. Dalby. - You see, they found them, up ahead in the village. - Got you. - Oh I do hope they don't hurt Ellen. We've hardly gotten a chance to get to know each other. - They have got the whole street lit up, and if we go out the front, they are gonna see us for sure. - [August] Well there's no back door. - August... Your, your face. - It's not my face anymore. (crack) What was that? - The building across the street. - [August] There is no building across the street. - We better get out of here before we're next. - Be careful, Joseph. If you kill them we are finished. - He mustn't get away. Keep searching! (suspenseful music) (pounding) (shatter) - Ow! Oh, my leg. Come on. We've got to go. Careful. - We only have to hide out until the train passes the station for the last time, right? - That's what Landros said. - Well let's get out of here. Hurry! - Too late. I can't. Just go to the station. - August... - Go. I'll meet you at the station. I would have stayed with her, but I think she has a better chance on her own. I'm just gonna lay low for a while until they stop with these lights. Besides, I don't like Ellen seeing me like this. I mean, I stayed home from school one day 'cause I had a pimple on my forehead. But, I mean, it looked like a third eye, but this? (raps) Talk about unwanted blemishes. Plus, my legs are getting stiff. I'd just slow her down. I think she's better off on her own. - Okay, meet me at the station? Hello? Like I can take a hint or whatever, but just five minutes ago he was trying to kiss me. He totally was. So, I don't know. Do you want to limp around and turn plastic by yourself, or do you want to be with me? And like I'm supposed to know where the station is. - She's smart. She'll be able to find the station. She's gonna be okay. I'm sure of it. (Ellen screams) (thud) - Thank you, Mrs. Dalby. - Well what good is she? It's the boy. It's the boy who must be on the train. - Don't worry, Joseph. You do not know human boys as I do. - But I am a human boy. - Besides Joseph, it's time we must open the store. - But why? Why open the store at all? We haven't found the boy yet. - The boy will show himself, Joseph. Trust me. Now, it is important that we open the store. The police are gone for now, but, should they return, they mustn't find anything out of the ordinary. Nothing to arouse their suspicions, especially with a life-size boy made of plastic. You will stay in the back room, out of sight, at least until your transformation is more complete. Why, Billy! - Hi Mr. Dalby. - Hi. Hey, tell me about your sister, and Auggie. Have they found them? - How did you know? - Why, the police, they came here early this morning. Oh I'm so worried, Billy. Have they come home yet? - No, not yet. - Oh dear. Very very disappointing. But you'll come and tell me as soon as they do? Won't you, Billy? - I think I'm just gonna hang here for a little while. - Billy, Billy. Come on, we're not-- - Please, Mr. Dalby. I'm just in the way at home. My parents are totally freaking out. I promise, I won't touch anything. Please? - Why, of course, Billy. Of course you can stay. Oh, have you eaten anything, hm? - There, you see? - Thanks, Mr. Dalby. (Mrs. Dalby laughs) (whistle blowing) (whistle blowing) - Ellen? Are you here? Ellen? Ellen? It's me. (mysterious music) (whistle blowing) (train chugging) Ellen? (bell tolling) - Good morning. That's what you say, isn't it? When someone wakes up? Good morning? - Where's August? - No, don't worry about him. He'll be along shortly. - Dalby seems to think so, anyway. - It's unacceptable if you ask me, an unacceptable risk he's taking with Joseph's life. - It isn't Joseph's life. He doesn't have a life, and he isn't gonna be getting one. August is gonna come nowhere near this train. - Oh but, then you'll perish along with Joseph. Surely Auggie won't let that happen, will he? Tell me Ellen, what do girls like us do in your world? - Girls like us? - Yes. What can I expect? Once I'm human, I mean. - You are never going to be human. - What do you mean? - What I mean is, we're gonna get out of here somehow, and when I do, I'm gonna make it my life's mission to see that you never get out of your own box again. - Oh dear. - Whoa. Where'd you come from? (mysterious exotic music) - Billy, what are you doing? - Is Mrs. Dalby doing inventory in there? - [Mr. Dalby] Mrs. Dalby? - How did you like your brownie, Billy. - Yeah, thanks Mrs. Dalby. - There is no one in the back room, Billy. Why do you ask? - I just... I don't know. - Maybe it's time you went home, Billy. Perhaps your sister is home now, and Auggie too. - Yeah, okay. Okay. Maybe you're right. (Billy grunts) Can you say, wrong? There's somebody back there, all right. I'd bet my Play Station on it. First of all, Dalby was just talking to someone back there, and someone was just tugging on the door. That was not my imagination, overactive or otherwise. But you know how I know for sure? Whenever adults break out those phony ear-to-ear smiles and start offering you plates of brownies and cookies and stuff, man, you can be sure something's up. I've been around a long time, you know, and you can't con a con man. There's one thing that bugs me though. If it was August or Ellen back there and they were in trouble, why would they tug on the door like that? Maybe someone else is back there. One thing's for sure, those Dalbys are lying. And whoever is back there, has something to do with August and my sister. I'm gonna prove it. A kid with my rep, you've got to prove it. (birds coo) (hammering and scraping) (clang) (thud) Whoa, cool. (mysterious exotic music) August? Ellie? Are you in here? Ellie, is that you? August? - You lookin' for me? (Billy gasps) (Joseph shrieks) (clatter) (dramatic music) (clatter) - Please watch the register, Mrs. Dalby. - Yes, Mr. Dalby. - [Mr. Dalby] Joseph, what have you done? - A boy! There was a boy, Dalby. He was looking for them, calling their names. He saw me. What do we do? - Nothing. No one will believe the fantastic story he's about to tell. (whistle blowing) (bell tolling) - Of course. Who would believe such a thing? - We should be going slower. He'll never be able to get on the train at this speed. (whistle blowing) Look, there he is. Look! - Yes. August. - He's on board. He's on board. - Let's see that he doesn't get off. - Oh, good afternoon, officers. Hello Billy. Good news I hope. - Not yet, Mr. Dalby. Actually, we're here for a few more questions. - Of course, anything I can do. - Billy came to us with, um, well, quite a story. - (laughs) Yes, it is his gift. - Ask him about the back room. - The back room? - Billy claims to have seen somebody in your back room. - But there is no one back there. (laughs) Mice perhaps, and trains of course. - Mr. Dalby, do you and your wife live here alone? - Yes, but there is our grandson visiting from out of town. - And you keep him locked in the back room? - Billy. Of course not. - Would you mind if we speak to your grandson? (door clicks) - Uh, here he is now. Joseph, these police detectives would like to speak to you. They would like to know if your grandpa keeps you locked in the back room. - Billy, is this the boy you saw back there? - Yes. I mean, no. He's different now. - Billy, it was you? We thought we had prowlers. Joseph, was it Billy you surprised? - I'm sorry if I scared you. I thought you were a burglar. - Look at his hands. Make him show you his hands. - My hands? Which hand? What's wrong with my hands? - Please officers, go and have a look. We have no secrets here. - They're lying, I know it. - Come on, kid. Take it easy. - Billy, do you think me such a monster? And Mrs. Dalby? We are concerned for Auggie, and for Ellen. Please, stop with this fantastic story, will you? - I'm not making it up. He was different. He wasn't human. - Billy, please. - [Detective Wilson] Billy, that's enough. - I know he did something with August and Ellen. I know it. (thud) (dramatic music) - Oh! (rumbling and creaking) - [Ellen] August! - Sorry, Mr. Dalby, Mrs. Dalby. We'll be in touch. - Come on. (grunting and scuffling) (hiss) - Oh, what is it now? - You okay? - Yeah, just untie me. - Turn away. (shatter) - Blast it. What a mess. No, you are not going anywhere. Blast it. I'm melting. I'm melting! - There. Let's go. - We have to get off the train. There's no other way. - There is no way I can jump, August. We are going too fast. Can't we slow it down? - We have to get off the train. I'm sorry Ellen, but we have to jump. - Then jump. - What? - Jump. You're almost totally plastic. If you jump, it won't hurt anything. - I can't just leave you here. - You have to. If you're on the train when we pass through the station, you're gonna be stuck here forever. - I am not gonna leave you. - It's your only chance, August. You have to. I want you to. - Wait. It's just a model train. It's just a model. - [Conductor] Stop them. Stop them! - There's another way. - August, look. - We can tie it with this. - Open up! - Okay, now what? - We get that unhooked. (whistle blowing) - Let's do it. (wind) - All right, go on the plastic. Grab it. Keep pulling. - Harder? - For some reason they're pulling. - I'll stop them. - We are too close now. We can only hope that they fail. - We're missing it. - What? - [August] It should be here. It's not. - Hurry. - All right, I got it, I got it. Pull. Pull. - They're gonna get away! - Apparently the engineer doesn't share your pessimism. - Now. Come on. - You're not going anywhere. - That's it. Stop them. Stop them you fools. - Sorry to spoil your fun, Ellen. - Have you ever seen a Jackie Chan movie? - No, but it sounds interesting. (Girl screams) - Well that's as close as you're gonna get. - Help! - Got it. (exhale) - We made it, young man. - Yeah. Go team. - Get off of me! (laughter) (creaking) (shattering) - August? August, wake up. Wake up. - [August] Mr. Landros? - In the flesh. Mrs. Ellerbee too. And it's all thanks to you. Welcome back. (peaceful music) - Ellen. - [Pavel] Right there beside you. - Ellen, we're back. - Is that you August? - Hi. - Would you look at this sunshine, children? Isn't it glorious? - I uh, don't know if your grandson still likes model trains, but if he does, this is a pretty good one. - Oh. That's sweet of you, August. He might like it. But if he doesn't, would it be all right if I smashed it to bits? (laughter) - Sure. - Goodbye, Mrs. Ellerbee. - I'm sorry I wigged out on you back there, Mr. Landros. - Oh, nonsense my dear. You merely pointed out the obvious. - I did? - Yes. One should play the hand one is dealt in life. We have no business dealing for ourselves. Mrs. Ellerbee was right about the sun. It is a glorious day. It's a perfect day, eh August? - Well, nothing's perfect. - Right you are, my boy. Right you are. Buh-bye. - So August, how do you feel? - Good. How do you feel? - I'm okay. Getting better. - Hey uh, next time we go to the movies... - Yeah? - Let's go bowling instead. - Okay. (haunting mysterious music) (exotic instrumental music)
