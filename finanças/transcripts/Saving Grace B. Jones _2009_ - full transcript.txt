I was ten years old when I learned about life. My mother had passed away about seven months earlier. And I was struggling so hard to try to understand this very deep loss. I often lost myself in the movies, trying to imagine what my life was going to be like. One night I stayed very late. She's lost a pig, boy. No chance. He's gone. All right, let's go, folks. The show's over. Come on, get this dump out of here. Let's go. Now! I became unresponsive. Words no longer fell joyfully from my mouth. My sleep was guarded and mostly fearful. Daddy was concerned. He decided as summer approached, that I needed a change of environment. To help me through this period of my young life. He had an old army buddy, landy bretthorst, and his wife. I was to spend the summer with them. And hopefully forget the brutal violence that I had witnessed. They lived in the small Hamlet of boonville, Missouri. Smack dab in the middle of an america I had only seen in the movies. Arriving in Missouri was like a movie coming to life, only it had much more color. And the smell of the countryside with its mixture of wheat fields, corn fields and flowers was welcoming and comforting. My mom says Lucy has the best singing voice in Franklin county. But she ain't even in the choir. I like singing in the movies. You go to the movies someplace around here? We got a show house back in town. Five silver milk bottle tops will get you in for ten cents. Come on, let's go. Come on! Landy and his wife, bea, had a daughter my age, Lucy. And across the street were the Carter girls, Molly Jane and little opal. Wait up! I suffered a trauma. A trauma? No kidding? They all lived on the top of the banks of the majestic Missouri river. Something happened in New York. Landy also had two acres of farmland to grow their food. His newly acquired business was the local bakery. Boonville, home of frank and Jesse James, population 317, was as far removed from the violent streets of Brooklyn as you could get. If this is a cornfield, where's the corn part? Under these plants? No. Come on, Carrie. Come on. Where you want this? Over there. You got you a serious problem, landy. Morning, Phil. You want a BlackBerry sweet roll? Just out of the oven. Did you hear what I just said? Blackberries? Why thank you, landy. Don't mind if I do. Why you giving away free rolls today? Some folks make problems out more serious than they really are. I got perspective. You know, I met her today. You want to fetch Gracie home. Everybody knows that. You need some company? Dan going with you? He was her husband. Yeah, he was. Long time ago. You know how long it's taken me to convince those yahoos in Jefferson and Oklahoma city she'd be okay at home? This time, I'll Grant you, but... Let's get on with that problem. Right in there. Growled at me. Hear that? They carry fever, landy. I wish you'd get your rifle out here. I told you! Did I tell you? I do believe I did. He just bit you! You soft in the head, landy? There's some that say. It's a fox. Pretty little thing. Took a pretty little chunk out of your hand. He was just protecting himself. Fine. Let's shoot him. That fox has got the rabies and bites somebody? You'll be to blame. If that fox has got the rabies, I reckon I'll be the first to know. I'll help you load what garbage we can. Just leave this pile for now. If he's safe and dry, he won't hurt nobody. Well, it's your problem, I guess. But if you've got problems after, you just go ahead and shoot it. If I just shot all my problems, I'd have the widow of every fool in this town piqued at me. They'd start buying their bread up in Franklin and then where would I be? You're a real card, landy. A regular Jack Benny. Of course I don't imagine your opal'd make a fuss. Ho, ho. Probably bake me a pie. Hardee-har-har. Her pies aren't up to much though. Come on, let's get that garbage. It's really starting to come down. Hoo-hoo! There you go! Daniel? You can go with landy if you like. If you need to. Grace! Bye, Lucy. Bye, Carrie. Hey! I believe this is a double feature I've been waiting for my whole life. Lucy! Hey, mister! You headed our way? If I am, it's an accident. And I'm set to turn around. Come on! Come on, Carrie. Been arrested yet? Arrested? No. How was the movies? My god. Hey, y'all! Landy! Brought you all some tomatoes and a salt shaker for your trip! Wipe those feet! Here you go. Hey, girls. That's real nice, opal. Thank you. Lands, you didn't tell me you were planning on feeding Arkansas on the way through. The less he has to stop, the sooner I get him back. Don't you fret woman. Just be my girl. Lem bet Phil two dollars we'll lose the south bridge before this rain stops. Landy, you sure this can't wait? I think Phil is going to win himself a couple of dollars. This can't go on much longer. There just ain't that much rain. All right, be safe! I love you! I left the dough to rise. Just put it in the oven in the morning! Bye, bea! See ya when you get back! Let's go inside. I'll make you a cup of coffee. How far to Oklahoma city? You ready to see some country, darling? Daddy! Stop the car, daddy! Come on! Lucy! Lucy, what is it? My gosh. Been raining on and off for three straight weeks now. It's the narrowest spot in the river, so it sort of piles up here. But a month ago, you could drop a rock from here and walk home before it hit the water. Gee whiz, it's higher. Even since I got here. Don't worry. Town's built on top of a hill. We got two Bridges. People worry about the south bridge though, because it's lower down. It's been unusual weather for this time of year. But we need to get to Oklahoma city, so let's go! So, what's the name of the hospital where they're keeping your sister? Well, it's a different kind of hospital, Carrie. It's... it's called an asylum. Must have been a real bad accident for her to be gone so long. She got hit by a real big truck. Sort of like that, daddy? Yeah, that was the start of it. It was on her wedding day she got hit by that truck. Broke her back. Smashed her skull, smashed her up awful. She was just 17. Doctor said she was mending. There was so much to heal. Last thing to mend was her mind. We lost her. She was there... Then she wasn't there. She would talk to spirits, couldn't do much for herself. And we couldn't help much neither. There was no place for her to go. There was no hospital that would keep her more than two years. She couldn't even feed herself. I said I'd watch her, but the family needed me to work the farm. They came and took her on a Tuesday morning. July 6th, 1935. 1935? Gee whiz! Well I sure could use a hug right about now. I believe I'm short on hugs to the tune of about one. I love you. I love you guys. Hey, Carrie. How you like being a country girl? Hey, Lucy, Carrie. Sit down over here. Please sit. No, thank you. I'm fine. This is a holding place for the hopelessly insane. Do you know what that means, Mr. Bretthorst? I think you'll find everybody short of president Truman's signature on these papers. They're real clear. She comes out now. The very best doctors and judges we have have said the people who come here will never be right again. Maybe the doctors are smarter than you and me. You all have had me chasing her down for years. I have letters from my sister. I have spoken to her on the telephone. She sounded just fine. Please, please, brother dear, come get me, take me out of this horrible place. She's clever. Just because they're crazy doesn't mean they're not clever. If she had a chance to heal, they never would've sent her here. That was a mistake. You could save yourself and your family a lot of pain if you just turn around and head on back home. Whatever your sister was died a long time ago. She's not fit to live in the outside anymore. Mental illness is elusive. Cunning. You're just gonna be dragging her back here in a couple of weeks. Damage will be done. Far greater than you could imagine. I'm a little pressed for time. You finished, ma'am? The children will wait here. We're fine, daddy. Maybe we'll go see if we can find some flowers somewheres. Flowers belong to this institution and are not for little girls to pick. Okay, okay. Excuse me, excuse me. Crazy people are difficult to get used to. Sweet Jesus, miss shrank. Why'd you bring a civilian on the floor? I wanted this man to see something. The view is better from here. Right now. Settle down. Settle down. By the way, I don't think the children should be in the same part of the house with grace. They seem a little high strung for this business. Medications ready for ward four. Hello, grace. It's me. Hello, landy. Well, darling. Time to go now. There you go. Come on. Atta girl. You look beautiful, you know that? Aunt grace! Hi, aunt grace! I'm Lucy. I love you aunt grace. Here. These are for you. And this is Carrie. She's a good friend of the family and she's gonna be with US for the summer. Nice to meet you, ma'am. It's grace. Just grace. Let's go. Grace. Come on. It's just great to have you out, aunt grace! Like... like Christmas! We've been waiting for this part near forever. Have we got a party planned for you. Everybody in town's bringing food. Mama says we can be at the movie if we don't crash into folk. And the summer fair is coming next week! Summer's gonna be so much fun. Charming. It's been so many years since I've seen children. They're almost like little people, aren't they? Hi, there. I figured I'd find you here. You all right? I hope I can do this for you. I hope it's gonna be all right. It's right. It'll be strange, but we'll take it nice and slow. If you have any problems, you come to me. I got all the time in the world for you. I'm not very different from everybody else. You feel different because the world is different. You're like rip Van winkle. Stuff most people take for granted, you slept through. We had another world war. About everybody in the country's got a car. And we got picture shows now that you wouldn't believe. I remember how you especially used to like those. And I'm thinking about buying a television. Have you seen one of those? No. Your life is going to be so full of catching up. I don't understand everything, but I like to hear you talk. Well, you'll see it for yourself now, too. It's your life now. It belongs to you. You can do with it what you please. That's what scares me. Well, don't let it. I'll handle any and all scares now and forever. I'm here for you. I miss this river of ours. Me too. Dan was a long time ago. How you doing? What'd you bring me, Phil? I made you a bundt cake. Thank you. Opal must've made that. I fed your fox. I told landy that if grace was home and the good lord wanted her to be with US than he would pave the way. And she's here. Where is she? Well, she'll be down in a minute. The good lord and landy. Seems like landy's been working at getting grace home every spare minute for the last umpteen years! Well, I am grateful that they made it home alive in spite of that storm. That is a miracle. You hear the south bridge washed out today? No! I don't know what time landy made it in at, but Davey lund told me he watched that bridge float right past his grain mill just after 4:00 this afternoon. Davey, Davey. South bridge gone? Born and raised here and I don't think I've ever seen it like this. Ooh! Hello! Lovely party, Mrs. Bretthorst. Lovely party. Well, thank you, ladies, for coming. And I saw some mighty fine dancing in there. Now who wants one of my very famous cherry tarts? Yes, ma'am! No, ma'am. We was just looking for Lucy. She loves your sweets as much as her mother. Hey, reverend Potter. Lucy, I did not hear your golden voice in the last chorus sunday. Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir? Run along. But I will see and hear you sunday. What was he talking about? I never remember. Whoa. Whoa. I only count three head here. Where's Carrie? Me and Molly Jane's going looking for her. And me! Yes. Little Carrie, she's just doing fine. Carrie! Carrie! She's gotta be someplace. Why don't she come when we holler? Could be the trauma. Yeah, yeah. She's crazy too. You saying my friend's crazy? No, just your aunt. She was in a nut house. You was in a farm last week. That make you a cow? Punch her, Lucy! Everybody's a little crazy. Judging by someone else's rules. You gonna punch her? You know how you've been saving the fluff out of your belly button in that old band-aid box? There's some that would say that makes you crazy. It don't mean that. I know. But you remember that before you go calling someone else crazy. I'm gonna make a sweater. Grace? Well, are you ready to come down? People are anxious to see you. Now. Come here. I told landy this would be hard. No, no, no. I'm good. Almost everybody we growed up with is here for you, grace. Landy just thought that if... if we showed everybody that you are all right, it would smooth your way. I'm fine. I'm gonna come. I'll come now. You're so good, bea. I know how to do things. I can... I can be helpful. Grace, don't. Don't. It's not necessary. Listen... You're home now. I got something for you. Remember this? It was your momma's. Here, let me pin it for you. All right. There now. Look at that. Isn't it lovely? Yeah. Now let's go down. If rainwater was beer, Clint Dexter wouldn't have minded filling up his parlor today. If rain was beer, Dexter's parlor would've never got wet. That's she herself. Hi, Gracie. Hi. Hi, miss grace. You look great, Gracie. Grace bretthorst. How are you, child? I'm better. Lots... lots better. Fish fries, some cornbread, and apple butter, and you'll know you're home, darling. Come on. You look just beautiful. Her hair! It's gotten so long. You remember, I'm Lem. You remember Lem, don't ya? It has been so many years. And the last time you and I were together, miles Braden and David lund were having a fist fight over you down at dairy queen. Do you remember that? Ella Jean? Dan. You're late. Landy. Dan wasn't sure he'd be welcome. That's crazy. You'll be living right across the street. You'll wanna get to know her. I'm looking forward to it. Come on in. I'll go on and find bea, then. Okay. I'm sorry I couldn't stand on this with you, landy. I've loved the both of you since we was kids. I always saw our whole lives together. And I pray we can still do that. I pray to god I was wrong about grace, but i... we were all wrong for a while. But if we let her spend another day in hell for no good reason, be tough to live with that. Tell me, Dan, when you love someone, where does your obligation end? You don't think I thought about that? What could I have done that you didn't? Just would've been two of US doing it. Maybe it's best we just say our hellos and leave with everybody here and all. It's important that you stay. She'll wanna see you and she needs to know where we all stand. Crawfords? Breyertons? Carters? They're all here. Reverend Potter? Yeah, he's here. Watchdogging. People'll be taking sides and they wanna know which one you're on. Landy, you sure you told her about me and Ella? I told her, Dan. But when it comes to you, I just... I don't think she hears me. I never meant her no harm. You know she owns a small piece of me still. I know. Come on. Let's go in. You'll be all right. I'm tired. Just tired. Hey, Dan! We been waiting on you. Miles says now they got cars that run on potatoes. Of course all the boys were fighting over you back then. I got one of your leftovers. Remember Nathan? Of course all you could see back then... Tell miles he's an idiot so we can lay this to rest. A lot of girls were happy to see you go... that didn't come out quite right. Well, there she is. Hi, Gracie. Welcome home. This is my... my wife, Ella Jean from down cooter way. Hello. Welcome home. You look just fine, grace. I'm glad for you. We're glad for you. We were just saying that we needed to find you so we could have a word with you before we have to leave. Ella needs to get home. She's having a baby. She's tired. You know? We could talk. We'll see you real soon, Gracie. Okay? Goodnight. I'm so glad we could say hello. 'Night, Lem. 'Night, Phil. G'night, janey. You tell Nathan, if he needs help hauling furniture tomorrow, i... I could help him if we can find a truck. G'night, Dan! Glad landy got you home, grace. We'll... we'll see you tomorrow then. We'll... we'll see you everyday. G'night. 'Night. I know you've gotta go back. It's okay. I thought you knew, grace. I'm sorry. They told me I should get on with my life. They... they said it'll never be the same. They said you were never for me. You're a good woman, grace. You're a good woman. I'm sorry for what you went through. I wasn't there. But I am not sorry for the time I loved you, you hear me? If I had known, i... I would've kept trying. And I swear I would've. And that... Thank you for that. Thank you. We could talk sometime. Every day if you'd like. Every day. Every day, grace. Every day if you'd like. You can let go now. Okay? It's good that you're back. Ella Jean, she's pregnant, you know. I was just thinking, if it turns out a girl, would... would you mind? I'll talk to Ella. I'll talk to Ella. Good night. Welcome home, grace. Welcome home. Hi, grace. You like the party? There was so many people and so crowded. I did this. At my brother's party. He was 12. Nobody could find me. I guess that means we're alike. I wasn't always crazy. Boys fought over me, men fought over me. I had a boy fight over me, once. This boy, Tommy, knocked this boy, Johnny, his tooth out to be my boyfriend. I liked it. How old are you? Almost eleven. In a couple of weeks. I was first proposed to by the time I was 13. First? Four times before my 17th birthday. I married... I married the fourth one. Who were you married to? Dan Jones. From across the street? Dan Jones? I loved him for as long as I could remember. It was on that wedding day that... I had no bouquet. I threw the wedding bouquet, you know, like I was supposed to. There was always flowers in jenkin's field across the highway. I was pretty once. Y'all settled in for the evening? Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. You had fun tonight, didn't you? Yes. Were the people nice to grace? Was she happy to see them? I believe things will work out just fine for grace. People thought she was crazy just because she liked to be alone. That doesn't make you crazy? No, it doesn't. Have you ladies said your prayers? See that you do. Mwah! Good night, Carrie. Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite. Mwah! Let's go! So where are they headed? To that colored gospel meeting? Of course they are. If they asked you, you've said no. Are you sure it's all right? Carrie's not as sturdy as your daughter and it's still drizzling out. Lucy's been going there for months. And Carrie's stronger than you think she is. Well. I guess it wouldn't matter if the... Bedsprings started creaking some while they were out. Minx. I thought you had religion. I'm married. And I'm going to bed. I know where you live. Yes. Thank you! Hey! You're late. But I brought an extra soul to save! Pa-raise Jesus! Well, I have to concede your appreciation for services. But in the future, would you please conduct your milk bottle top changing outside my temple. Wow. That music tonight. Thank you, brother hendryks . You're welcome, sister. Bye, thank you. Good night, now. That was so swell. Goodnight. We should go. I can't wait for next week. Where were you? Shhh. Come on. Goodbye, Molly. Bye. Bye. Let's go. Good morning, folks. This is Floyd hufstedler with your morning update. Good morning, daddy. Wow. Nobody's expected to rise so early, they have to feed the baker. Heck, I don't even make your momma get up at this hour. It's the baker who wakes up the rooster. I know, daddy. Daddy, I found Jesus. I want to convert. How'd Carrie take to the services? Just like a duck to water is all. You would too if you'd come. Well, I might just have to do that one of these first Friday evenings. You do know that you're already a baptist, don't you? Reverend dupree is just a baptist of a different color. You wouldn't say that if you'd been. Believe me. There's just flat ain't no comparing them two. Carrie said it's the most elegant church she's ever had. Who's ever at the kitchen door may as well come in and have their breakfast. Aunt grace! Morning, grace. Go ahead. Sit down. You're welcome to get up just as early as you can stand to, grace. You can even join me at the bakery if you'd like. You might find it real interesting. Your aunt's a very fine seamstress. And your sewing machine over there up last week. Bea knows where it's at. It smells good in here. Nobody in this house have the sense to stay in bed until the sun shines? I expected better of you, Carrie. We'll get our chores done now so we can goof off the rest of the day. Your ambitions and mine walk the same road, short bread. Well, well. What do we have here? Momma! Good morning. Hello, grace. Did you do all this, sweet pea? Ain't it a wonderful thing for a man. To have all his family around in the morning. I'm hungry. Me too. He feet were covered with mud. And the bottom of her nightdress too. Wow. Those are so pretty. Hey, girls! Keep them slickers on! She's really not so strange, you know. Daddy says she's a fine seamstress. Let's go find some nice stuff to sew. I don't want you to ever go back to New York. Landy, do you know you got you a red fox move itself a blanket and set up house next to your trash piles? Indeed I do. You want me to shoot him? Everybody who sees that fox wants to shoot him. I drop down on my knees twice a day and pray I never get as popular as that fox. Think it'll ever stop raining? Afternoon, reverend. Excuse me, reverend. Reverend dupree says you might have some of that day-old stuff for them that have been flooded out. There's seven of them living in the church basement. Yeah, I was, um... I was just taking it out. Take everything on that far rack. So, any more folks washed out in the bottoms? Old Walt everess. No. Landy? You know most of this day-old stuff is still warm? God bless you, landy. For the kids. Just take it. I thank you, landy. And you tell those folks at the church, I'll be baking every day. I will. Reverend. Deacon. It'll stop soon. In five months I have never had any free baked goods here. Have a cookie, reverend. I believe I will. You know, I wouldn't mind having a loaf of that fine wheat bread you bake. Yeah? Well, help yourself. I believe I will. Landy... Have you ever took a good, hard look at grace and the prospects of this new life you want her to have? I see a scared girl whose body grew up without her. A system. The 40s. All of US. We failed and she got caged instead. Well, she's gonna get that help now. I'm very sorry about her years of hardship. But can you see what it's done to her? For having spent nearly 20 years in an asylum, I think she's pretty damn good company. What about the cost to your family? Cost to the community? Everybody's afraid they're gonna have to get involved in this situation. What situation? Hell, she ain't never hurt no one. Landy, I know that asylum. After 17 years of that kind of horror, who among US could ever be the same? We have no law here. The sheriff's clear over in Columbia. And if she ever gets out of hand, we don't have a cell. A cell? All she ever did wrong was get hit by a truck. She spent her whole life in a goddamn cell, and she ain't going back to any cell! Landy, landy bretthorst. A pillar of love and compassion who's brought his sister home, has triumphed over the devil himself. How much more of a hero do you need to be? You claim you know about life without ever having to live a real one. So unless you wanna take off that pretty, starched shirt and put on an apron, I got work to do. This is for the bread and for the cookie. We want seats toward the front 'cause that's where the boys like to sit. Here they come! Oooh! Molly Jane's on her own. Ms. Woodstow, here's Lucy's and here's mine. And save these milk bottle tops for the Carter girls. Thank you. Do we have to sit by the boys? Shhh. Your little plan is super, you know. Good movie. Bye, Lucy! Bye, Carrie! That was scary. Excuse me. Next Saturday, we're having a dance up at the school if you'd like to go. You'd need a formal. Sure, maybe. Yes, she'll go. We're just on the corner of 4th street. 22 4th street. I'll call on you then. See ya. Boy, she's real pretty. So what do you think? I don't have a dress. And I've never been out on a dingle date before. I'm 10 and a half. I wonder what my daddy would say. He's from military school. If he tries anything funny, his teacher will shoot him. This water of itself is not evil. It is, after all, life. The psalmist says good counsel is like deep water. And a man of understanding will draw it out. Let US not fear the rains. But let every man turn to his neighbors. That god might see good baptists united in service and be satisfied. One further thought before we conclude. The pressures of life are not simple. And virtue is not always the answer. May love overcome the void. Amen. Our faith is in him. Amen. Amen. Blankets and food stuff will be collected outside for the needy. Bless you all. She's getting so big. Who wants pancakes? Me! Great sermon, reverend. I'm afraid it was a little too long in closed quarters for you, wasn't it, grace? Hell, I was feeling a little anxious myself. Little opal! Come back! Bye! Good seeing you, grace, hon! Fried chicken tonight? Fried chicken! Yay! Carrie, you flour the chicken. I'll fetch the apple butter for the biscuits. Listen, sweetheart. This... this is how you do it. You take the flour, put it in the bag, right? And once it's in the bag, you put the chicken in there, see? You put all this lovely chicken in there, and guess what else you can do? You can shake it! You see? See? And then we have beautiful, beautiful floured chicken. You see that? She was gonna glue flour on every piece of that chicken. Just trying to make it stick just like that. It got in my ear! Grace! Come on, grace. We were just being silly. Come here. Come back. Grace. Look how beautiful. Gosh. Wow. Anybody who could do a job like this wouldn't bat an eye at stitching up a formal. Well, hello, Dan. Well, come on in. Evening, bea. Good evening. Landy should be home directly. He was sandbagging the widstow place. Where was he and the kids? We found everybody. They'll be fine. Yeah. Grace! You've got a visitor! It's Dan! You... you have... It's flour. The girls and... we were playing. Here, take it. There she is. Hello, grace. You look sprightly tonight. I... I caught these catfish at one of the sinks been popping up from the rain. You can't find the bottom to it no how. I figure it's been a while since you had a fresh fish. Excuse me. The girls are making dinner. Certainly more entertaining. No, it's all right. Thank you. Bye, bea. Well... I got supper waiting and i'm dripping all over bea's floor. Thank you. Gracie... I just wanted to tell you how... how pleased I am about the way you've been taking all this, grace. Real pleased. You have a nice night now. I'm here. Yeah. Dan, I'm here. That you are, grace. That you are. Good night. Because nobody cares because you aren't. You aren't but you're still her. You aren't but you still feel so lonesome and homesick. You're surrounded by people who aren't and they don't care 'cause they just don't want you to be. If you can't really be, what's the point of living? There is no happy. Nothing is pretty. Nothing smells good. Nothing sounds nice. There's nothing. You got nothing! All you got is nothing. All you're ever gonna be is nothing. Morning, aunt grace. Morning. Morning, grace. We have coffee and toast in the kitchen. But wait, have you eaten? Landy? Landy? Phil's outside. I gotta get another pair of socks. Phil says that if we don't show up at the riverbank, main street will float away. Landy, landy, landy. I do need to talk to you. Are you okay? Did you sleep okay? No, I'm not. No, no, I didn't. We're needed at the river. We need flour sacks, feedbags, anything that'll hold sand! Lucy. Are you... do you know where you're going? Yes, ma'am. We're going to all the old people's houses, make sure they're all right, and ask for any extra cloth bags. Go, go, go. We'll be at the riverbank, grace. You come when you're ready. We could use an extra hand. But wait... landy? I need to talk to you. First thing tonight, grace. We got water coming up over the banks. The bakery could flood. Landy... no, listen. I swear, okay? I got some things I have to do. Just sit tight, okay? It'll only be a few hours. But I do need to talk to you. I really do. Go, Phil. Landy. Landy. I'm trouble. I'm doing things that I don't want to. There ain't nothing for it. It's like... it's like I'm watching somebody else I ain't got no relationship to. I don't remember free being this big. I can't handle it. I can't control it. I don't know how. I'm not really. Hey. Did you get enough to eat? The girls wanted to wait up for you, but. I miss kidding them pretty, little faces though. Hard day. I'd still be at the widstows if ned hadn't decided to just move his stuff. What the hell. It's flooded. Something to see. Someone lost a cow and it just kept floating by. My. And Davey's? His 11 acres are still okay. Just mudded out. Now the braydens. Lord, landy. The time it's gonna take to dry all this out. Take US till next summer. We've been in the news across the land. They say it's gonna keep on. The president's even talking about US. I know. We best take a hard look at this. Maybe get Carrie back to her father and US to Kansas City and hold out for a while. Let's not think about that. Grace made the most beautiful doll dress that's ever been. She gave the doll to Carrie. Well, that was nice. I think she likes her. Little squirt. Carrie got asked to a military dance too. Grace is gonna sew up a formal. The girls are so excited. What was that? What'd you say, dear? It's nothing. Good night, lover. Get in the car! Are you sure grace will be all right? She's been alone quite a bit. I think she's still asleep. She's gonna need that cloth if she's gonna have that dress done by tonight. This way you come back, she can get started. What's up, Phil? good morning, grace. there's no sense in US standing out in the weather like this. Is bea here? Nope. Nobody's with you? No. I heard you was taking up sewing. I have these quilt blocks that need stitching for my baby's blanket. I don't think I'm going to get to it, so, you want the work? Thank you. There's really nothing tricky to it. I don't think you'll have any trouble. Dear god. My gosh! It's gonna be so pretty! You hurry up inside, Carrie. Show aunt grace so she can get started. I'm gonna help your daddy at the bakery! You call me if you need me! Bye! I'm so excited! Aunt grace. Aunt grace? You there? Aunt grace, we found the most... she's out somewhere. My gosh. I wonder what that was. Yeah. It was a mistake. Aunt grace! You scared US. Did you get something for the gown? Yeah! Did we ever! Look at this! I like the one with the flowers. Looks just like the colors in my kaleidoscope. I used to have one of these when I was a little girl. Girls. You picked so good. We're gonna make a beautiful gown. You know, you didn't give young Carrie much time to whip up a formal gown. Yes, sir. We'll be having our family prayers at 10:30. I reckon you'll have her home by then. Yes, sir, Mr. Bretthorst. Yes, look at her. You look beautiful. Thank you. Is that corsage for Carrie? Yes, ma'am. I'll put it on. Here you go. You can go now. Have fun. Have a good time. The dress was absolutely beautiful. I think you made her look too good. And that boy is in love. So what. You all look so nice! boy, you look real pretty. Thank you. Would you like s... some punch? That'd be nice. here you go, darling. I was watching you out there. - So was it magical? - Did he kiss you? Come on. She won't give me the scoop. You're so cute! We pray for those chased out by the flood, including these kittens going to their new homes tomorrow. We're grateful for family, lord. We draw strength from one another and then give it back again. And that's the way that it should be. We're grateful to have grace home. And ask for her a blessing of peace and clarity. We're grateful for Carrie, who has blessed and improved our lives. We're grateful for home and hearth. And I'm grateful for the one who holds it all together. And we pray we won't all have to swim any tomorrow. Amen. Amen. We won't have to swim any tomorrow? That's right. Nice prayer, daddy. Aunt grace? Hi. Wow. Is that sky something or what? That is the most beautiful sunrise I've seen in my whole life. But I thought the same yesterday. Well, maybe tomorrow will be the best yet. I wonder if anybody will ever know I existed. I am crazy, you know. But I walked in the rain so many times before I was ever crazy. I saved a busted glass in a jar just 'cause I liked the colors. I broke in at the church to try and play music on the organ. And I rode a horse bare naked from the feeding grain all the way to Davis school on a dare. And I picked flowers at two A.M. in the moonlight by myself in Jenkins field lots of times. It's funny. The hard thing about being crazy is that you don't get to do crazy things anymore. I miss that. If we even this up some, nobody will even notice. Daddy's right. You can stack a Missouri sunrise against any of them, anywheres in the world. It's gonna be a fine day. I love you. I love you, too, Lucy. Hey, Mr. Carter! Hey, girl. Going fishing? Yes, sir. At the big sinkhole. If we can find any way, we'll catch 'em and clean 'em in time for Carrie's surprise birthday breakfast! She thought we all forgot. Hot dog! Somebody left US a boat! Carrie. Carrie, honey. Do you know where Lucy and grace are? Fishing. Lucy said she was taking grace to the big sinkhole fishing. Here. Here's your fishing rod. Okay, I'll put that down there. I wonder if mom would mind if I took you to the negro church sometime. I'm converting. Nobody minds if you wiggle there. In fact, they're flat insulted if you don't. Darn. Being crazy is one thing. Being on the water in a lightning storm is another. We better get going. Here. Give me your pole. Here. Let's just go to shore and we'll be all right. Come on. Come on. Start rowing. Hurry. Hurry. Paddle. Paddle. Hey, hey. What'd they do to you? That's an ugly bracelet. I'm scared. Just stay calm. No, no, no. Just keep paddling. God. It's okay. It's okay. Lucy! Lucy! Stay. Just stay calm. Wait! Wait! Stay calm! Just stay... stay calm. Let's swim to shore! Get your hand off me! Go away! Go away! Help! Gotta go. Go away go away. Our heavenly father must've had something very special he needed Lucy for. I only wish I knew. I would've cherished her more! This damn rain! Not a very happy birthday for you. It was an accident! Hey. Why aren't you asleep? Nobody is expected to rise so early they have to feed the baker. The bakers wake up the roosters. Thought don't mean the same for me that it does for other people. You gotta work. Would you like to come down and help me out this morning? Bea and grace need the quiet. Janey, and opal Lynn all came by today, landy. Brought their casseroles and breads. Bea said no. Yes, I said no. I said please stop bringing around all this food. All I have to do to occupy my mind is to cook. There's cobbler for dessert. Are you sending me back? That wouldn't change anything. I need something to occupy my mind. I need cobbler. It's the best. I hate pudding. Pudding and cold showers. I'd rather stink. No! No! It's mine! No. No, wait. I need the cobbler to occupy my mind. Grace, honey. No! What? It's for me! You're not supposed to touch it. I need it to occupy my mind. Okay, grace. Bea made plenty for everybody. I bite! Guards can't come into the sleep room at night! I bite! I bite! You tell them that! Landy! Goddamned baptists! You tell them that! You have to do something, landy. Grace. Grace. Them... those god-damned catholics! They don't answer! No! It's okay. It's me. God-damned catholics. They never answer. They never answer. I'm sorry. I'm just so sorry. Don't send me back, okay? All right? Okay. I'm sorry, landy. I can clean all this up. All right. Carrie? Are you okay? You do what you can here. Help grace. I'll be back. We'll go in your room and we'll talk. Okay? All right. Okay. Sit down. Go ahead. Sit down. Doesn't matter if it was an accident anymore! Losing your grip some after what happened is a natural thing. There's is nothing natural about rubbing peach cobbler on your face! And what about her arms? She's cut up. Her arms! Lucy was my baby! She's the only baby that I'll ever have! Grace is my only sister. Don't take her away from me. She killed my baby! It was an accident! And she's sorry, bea! She's so desperate sorry! Being sorry doesn't matter. Being crazy doesn't matter! My good, happy baby is gone! And your grace is here! Why did she do this to US? Don't you see what's happening here? My god! Can't you see what she's done! I want my baby! I want my baby! The Missouri river overflowing pretty much everywhere in callaway, Boone, Cooper, Howard, and saline counties. All central and west Missouri is pretty much treading water. ...livestock in town drowned... I pray my soul to keep. ...here in Columbia, the red cross seems to be keeping up with all those able to make it to shelter by boat. Authorities say phone lines are down in headway, roechport, wooldridge, boonville and lamine. Folks in these areas will have to get in touch with the local civil defense chapters for any emergency communications. If I should die before I wake, if I should die before I wake. We're so very grateful to have grace home with US again and we ask for your special blessings on her. It is reported there are at least 187 dead. And the Missouri river has now overflowed clear up into Iowa. The governor has requested that the president declares central Missouri a disaster area. Will you please just strike me dead! I've just been talking to opal Lynn. We got a radio message to your daddy. Everyone is very concerned about you. The roads are all closed. It's not safe here. You need to be home. Get somebody to fly you out somehow. I think I should be with you. You might need me. You've become quite a young lady in one month, Carrie staley. Opal Lynn has sided with grace on the... Accident. She wants to give her a chance. She's decided to let Molly Jane and little opal come over tonight for a sleepover. Keep you company. I love you, dear. You're a pleasure. It's the god-damned baptists! Baptists! Grace! Grace! What're you doing?!? Give me the scissors! God-damned catholics! Go, girls! Landy, do something! I am, bea! Drop 'em. Drop 'em! Okay. All right. I call and they never answer! They never answer! Grace, okay. Wait! God-damned catholics! They'll grab her hair. They'll touch it! They'll grab it! Grace. They'll grab her hair, landy! Listen, listen. Okay. What happened to my dog? What happened to gray? I don't know. I don't know. Let's go find her. Let's go find her, please? Okay. All right. Okay. You promise? I promise. Okay. All right. We'll do it another time. Go on. No. No, I want to stay! All right. All right. Coming, Carrie? No, opal! You just need some rest, grace. Tomorrow will be a better day. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Grace! Grace! Grace! Don't do this, landy! I'll sing. It's why I'm fine! What have you done? What did you to me to play god? I need flowers! What did you do to play god? Who are you to play god? I love you, grace! I tried! That was always your problem. You were always just too good! Well now, there's a hot place in hell for both of US. No, no. Carrie, I want you to sleep with bea tonight. I'll lock these away. All right, come on, sweetheart. Miles! The canal's overflowed! It's okay. Stay here. Old freedom road's underwater! Some say there's people in the water! We can't stop this, landy! This thing's coming to town! We need supplies, anything! I can't miles. Not tonight. I... he'll be out in a minute, miles! You best go get Dan and Phil. You nailed the windows and the door shut. She hasn't made a peep for hours. I'm sure she's asleep. I'll move her out as soon as I can. I can't think about that. Will you be all right? Yes. I just don't know what I'm gonna do. Maybe if she had her own place away from folks. Shhh. Go! Go! Any more problems, get Carrie to the river! Thank you. Give me a hand over here! Landy? Grace? Are you in here? What have you done? Carrie. Carrie, wake up. Listen to me. Listen to me. You need to go get landy. Grace! What're you doing? You can't do this! Now, stop it! Look at US, grace! We're coming apart! People are losing everything and look at what you do! You've still got a chance if you just get a hold of yourself! Now, get down here! I wanna see landy! Let's go home! Now! Landy! Landy! We're desperately busy, Carrie! You should go home now! It's gotta be grace! Why else would she be here? Landy! Landy! Carrie! Bea needs you! Grace is gone! Come on! Bad things are happening, and Dan would understand. I know he would. Dan does not belong to you anymore. Liar! I know what's going on in my own self. That water's cold. You think I'm crazy. No. I think you're very tired, grace, and so am I. Landy will be home and you can talk to landy. Now, please, please give me those scissors. You give me those scissors before you hurt someone else. You give them to me now. You're gonna lock me up! I know you're gonna lock me up! Don't say that! You give them to me, grace! You're hurting me! She's pregnant! She's pregnant with my baby! Grace! Grace! I told you to get off me. I told you to get off me. Grace, please. Please, grace! Grace. My god. Grace. I warned you about them god-damned baptists. I warned you. Gotta go see Dan. Gotta go see Dan. There's trouble over at landy's! What's the trouble? Is it grace? I'm afraid so! My god! My god! My... It's okay, darling! You're okay, honey. Help me. I already called for help, baby. I am... I am not gonna leave. We lost homes since you pulled these men off the river. People are running out of time. Somebody help! Somebody! Help! What's happening? I called for help. I'm sorry. Was it grace? Yes. God dammit! Carrie! She's gone. Grace! God damn you! Grace! Grace! We heard there's trouble! Landy, if you don't know where she is, we've gotta warn people. I told ya! I'm taking care of it! We're all crazy from working all night. No! No! We don't need guns! Put those guns down. You know better than that. I'll find him. God. Somebody! Opal! Opal! Somebody help me! Somebody! Somebody! My baby's coming! My baby's coming! Hi. Hello, angel. Hi, my beautiful. Hi. My beautiful girl. Thank you. Hello, little grace. Grace! Grace, why did you do this? We're only trying to help! Because she's a goddamn animal! That's why! No! Landy, no! Carrie! Get away from her! - No! - Now! Landy! No! Get out of the way! Not this way! Why take everything from me?!? Why take everything from me?!? Why the hell do you want everything?!? Help me, landy! Landy, no! Landy, please help me! Please help me! It's not going to be that easy! Get out! Grace. Carrie. I told you I didn't want no company. I think you'll be better off with the Carter's till I get back. I believe I'll just ride along, landy. You might need me. Landy bretthorst. You're a good man. I don't know why the lord chose to tax you so. I'm sorry. Grace, please now. I understand. It's gonna be all right. You said it would be better. It's gonna be all right. Don't send me back. I can't go back there, landy. You understand. Carrie, darling. We're here. Sit down here a second, okay? Now there's a really nice lady. And she's gonna look after you while I take care of grace. She'll have a ticket for you on an airplane for later on tonight. When you get home, your daddy will be waiting for you at the airport. I wanna go with you. I know, sweetheart. You've traveled the whole, long road. And I thank you for it. And I miss you. I'll think of you always... As you grow to be the strong young woman I suspect you'll be. But I have to send grace home now. I have to be the one to do it. And I have to do it alone. Grace? You're so pretty. Bye, grace. Come on. I got something for you. I think Lucy would've wanted you to have this. All right, I'm going. Go on. Goodbye. My summer with landy, and his family and grace has stayed with me all of my life. If you saw that summer in a movie, you'd never believe it really happened. Landy. Grace. Grace, I understand. It's gonna be all right. Everything is going to be all right. Thank you, landy. Everything is going to be all right. When I got home, I wrote a few times. But I never saw landy again. And so we never spoke of grace. Bea never survived the death of her beloved child or the wound she received from grace. I heard from the Carters, who remain friends till today. Then one day he got into his truck, and just drove away. No one ever saw him again. I never asked what landy meant by sending grace home. But I have somehow reached a kind of peace with that friendly horror that is with me still.
