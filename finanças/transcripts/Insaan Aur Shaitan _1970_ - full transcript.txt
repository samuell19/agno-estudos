Mr. Rustomji, this is top-secret information... ...about the train through which we are transporting the gold. Since loot and robbery are a norm nowadays, we don't want to take a risk. I want you to board a plane to Delhi today and deliver this envelope in person. Very good, sir. Take care, Mr. Rustomji! It's about the gold worth millions. Please bring it back! Don't worry, sir! I'll take great care of it. - Good luck! - Thank you! Good luck! I understood everything. Bichhoo! Mr. Rustomji is boarding a flight... ...to Delhi and he has papers containing the information... ...of the train carrying the gold. First confiscate the papers and then the gold. In case you succeed, you'll get half of the gold! You may go! [AIRPLANE ENGINE REVVING] Do not touch it! Sir, I've worn gloves, your bag will not be stained. No, please! - Give it to me. I'll keep it. - No, please! It's too sweet, isn't it? - Did you like it? - Yes. - Well, this is yours. - No, I can't take it. Come on. Be sporting. Please take it! Thank you very much! It is indeed too sweet. [AIRPLANE ENGINE REVVING] Excuse me! Please wear belts. It's okay. I'll take care of him. Mr. Rustomji! Mr. Rustomji? [SCREAMING] I have clearly seen the murderer. I can identify him too. He was sitting near Mr. Rustomji. In our list, the murderer's name was... - ...listed as Mr. Bankelal. - Look. I only want to know what you had witnessed. You appear pretty sighted to me. God has gifted me with wisdom too. And I'm pretty wise. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Yes? Hello! Alright. Put me on. Home Ministry. Hello! Yes? I am superintendent, Pandey! Fine, mister. I'll check it right away. We are expecting an officer from Home Minister, Mr. Vijay Chauhan. He'll be here to receive Mr. Rustomji's papers and briefcase. But we didn't find anything on Mr. Rustomji. He had a briefcase! I've seen it! And I have a healthy sight. I agree. But we didn't get any briefcase. Which means the murder was committed for that briefcase. As per the ministry, the briefcase contained... ...critical and secret papers. Sir, an officer from home ministry, Mr. Vijay Chauhan is here. Good morning, gentlemen! He is the one! He is the murderer! - She is crazy. - Just leave! Don't try to bluff me! I had seen you leaning over Mr. Rustomji to make him wear the seat-belt. I have a healthy sight. I agree. [GIGGLES] Please sit. We need your finger-prints. That's redundant because... ...he had worn gloves inside the airplane. Ma'am, I have not commuted by an airplane since a year. I have never worn gloves in my life. Forget a human, I have never killed an animal. Do you smuggle cocaine? What! Oh! There she is! How dare you suspect a government servant following a criminal's statement! Sir, Usha is not a criminal. We don't indulge in such activities. Sir, he gave me that statue. He said it's a gift for me. You, conman! So that was your plan to implicate me, wasn't it? No! I wasn't present in that airplane. If you want... What is it? Mr. Vijay! Where were you yesterday? I was at my office. - When did you leave? - Approximately at 3 p.m. You could've easily commuted between Bombay and Delhi. - I never left Delhi. - Then where were you? - I attended a party at my friend's place. - What was his name? Mr. S. Kapoor. Mr. Barua, please go along with him and investigate. Yes, sir! Please come. [FOOTSTEPS] Did you see this, mom? This file contains deep secret of the government. We can earn a lot of wealth just... ...by capturing it's photographs in a microfilm... ...and sending them to the enemies. This would have been impossible had your sister Tara, not been a typist in... ...the government office. [CHUCKLES] In fact, the truth is that our job wouldn't have been so easy, had... ...Tara not befriended Vijay Chauhan. It seems we awaiting a danger. I'll speak to home minister. Apologies, inspector. This fan needs to be repaired. Look, Mr. Vijay Chauhan is sweating, not me. I'm simply here to confirm if he was with you in last night's party. Not just the party. In fact, we had been dancing till midnight at a hotel. And, post midnight? Even modern gentlemen don't ask... ...such question to modern girls, nowadays. Moreover, I will be getting engaged to Tara. Government papers? Top secret? Stop it! What happened, sir? What's the matter? Explosion occurred in the room and inspector is injured. Just go! What happened, sir? Inform the police station about this incident. - Where is Vijay? - He has escaped! Just chase him! Go! [TRAIN HORN BLARING] [TRAIN COLLISION] [INDISTINCT] - Paper! - Newspaper! - Paper! - Newspaper! - Paper! - Newspaper! It's darkness around me, Lakshmi. I have lost both of my eyes. I've lost my job in railways too. Now we both are... ...dependent on Vijay. I hope he'll get the government job in Delhi. Everything will be fine. Don't worry. Oh, Allah! - Oh, almighty! Have mercy on me! - Mr. Banne! Mr. Banne, you survived with minor injuries, didn't you? Then why are you screaming like a goat meant for sacrifice? Mr. Shankarao! The more I scream, the more money will I get from the government. [GROANING] [INDISTINCT] Who is it? It's me! - Mr. Thakur! - "We hail you!" - He might be. Why should we care? - Really? The train got derailed and my friend, Shankarao Chauhan got injured. And you are asking why should we care? Do you think it's a petty matter? - We shall! - "Seek a revenge!" - Mercy on them? - "Never be done!" - Shut up! - This is a hospital! Ma'am, there are a lot of stones on the street. In seconds, this hospital will be... - "Indeed!" - What nonsense! The law will excuse them. Alright! Come on! - Mr. Thakur! - "We hail you!" The commander is here with his pocket evil battalion! Oh, God! Children nowadays are excused for everything! Mr. Shankar, thanks to the almighty for he saved your life! What is the use of having such a life... ...without eye-sight! - We'll fire! - "The railway station!" - We'll fire! - "The railway station!" What harm did railway station caused to us? Kids only follow what they... ...get to read daily in newspapers. It's their right. They are excused for everything! The one who bores them, they call him an uncle. Uncle Birju! We hail you! How unfortunate is that the uncle doesn't has a child of his own. Escape! Escape from the ladies! [FOOTSTEPS] - Dad! - Vijay! - Mom! - Vijay, my son! Dad, how did this happen to you? - [WHINES] - Dad... You used to always go on a certain route. - Why did you change the route this time? - What can I say, son! A driver's job is to lead the route instructed to him by seniors. But now I have not just lost my job... - ...but my eyes too. - Don't worry, dad. I will go to Bombay and earn a lot of money. Bombay? [HUMS] Are you planning to leave the government job? Yes, dad! Government job is not worth it. Job can't make you wealthy. Well said, Vijay! Foreigners looted us for 200 years. Now we are free to loot each other! If you are wealthy, you are excused! [FOOTSTEPS] - Where is he? - He is not here. Who are you looking for, inspector? - Is he the dad of Vijay Chauhan? - Vijay! Lakshmi! Lakshmi, where is Vijay? Vijay! Son, tell me what's the matter? Mom, cops are chasing me. Please let me go! My son! The apple of my eyes! You can't be a criminal! Mom, I will explain everything later. Let me leave! I didn't give birth to you to destroy the world. Tell me, what's the matter? I fed you with milk not greed! Mom, I beg of you! Please let me go! Let go off me! Mr. Shankarao, I can't say much without the evidence. But I can surely tell you that your son is an outlaw! And outlaw? But inspector, he is... - [FOOTSTEPS] - Lakshmi! Banne, get well soon. Because we have to go to Bombay. After reaching Bombay, we must find out why he... ...said that he'll become wealthy after reaching there. Boss, if you go there for two days,... ...I will stay bed-ridden for six months! [CAR ENGINE REVVING] He exploded the train and confiscated the gold! He instantly stored them in this truck and sent us off! He is indeed a genius! That's why he is called, 'Bichhoo'! He has done a great job! He would demand a huge sum as he has done a great job. If Mr. Solanki fails to meet his demands... ...he'll frame him too! That's the specialty of a scorpion! Hey! Who is she? A girl? How did a girl land in the forest? She is not moving aside! Hey! Move, ma'am! Please move! Please move, I say! Oh, ma'am! Please move, will you? Why are you walking in this heavy sunlight? Please come. I'll give you a lift. Please come. Come on! [SIGHS] [HOOTS] Hey! Why are you beating me up? - Hey, lady! - 'Where are you taking the truck?' - Hey! He is a man! - Please take us along! [INDISTINCT] - Mr. Bankar! - Yes. Someone is here at our garage. Okay. I don't know all that. - I need my share of gold! - Bichhoo! Sankat's men are after you! Sankat is not brave enough to take on Bichhoo! I need my share of gold, anyhow. Otherwise... I hope you're smart enough to guess that! Be extra-cautious tonight. Make sure nothing goes wrong. Do you get it? Master, your horse reached third in the race. Your destiny is lagging three steps behind you. - I have a solution to this too! - Sankat! Better stay away from Sankat, Mr. Solanki. I want to talk to you. - [HUMS] Is that the case? - You may leave. You may come later! Tell me, what harm can I cause to you? If you don't return my gold... - ...I'll have to send Bichhoo. - Bichhoo? [CHUCKLES] These rogues are thirsty for blood. Where is my gold? It is with the boss. Where is the boss? - It is in the 'Jwalamukhi Mandal'. - Where is it located? - Why don't you ask Mahabali? - Where is Mahabali? He is inside your car. "Govinda! Govinda!" We have got the gold! Thank you! Hey, 'Jwalamukhi'! 'Jwalamukhi Mandal' is a group of reputed individuals in this city. You don't know each other here. But I know everyone of you. Because I have your names and address stored inside this box. Our secret will remain a secret till... ...we don't get the authority under our control. And pretty soon, it will under our control. Our principle is to trade with the goons. The distinct individuals like you are... ...members of our 'Jwalamukhi Mandal'. We shall never break a law. We'll trade with goons. Goons will commit the crime and we'll stay out of it. But as soon as the stuff gets into our hands,... ...we would first kill those goons! Otherwise these people will get into making and breaking destinies. Hail, 'Jwalamukhi'! [TELEPHONE RINGING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello! 'Jwalamukhi Mandal'? What! Solanki has decided to send Bichhoo today! Sankat! Are you scared of Bichhoo? Don't cry for your boss and get rid of Bichhoo! Please kill! Understood? He often pays visit to Nishat Hotel. Mr. Solanki threatened me of sending Bichhoo! And boss had said that I will find Bichhoo here. Go... ...and kill Bichhoo! [FOOTSTEPS] [SONG] [SONG CONTINUED] [SONG CONTINUED] [SONG ENDED] [APPLAUSE] Just see how I make you dance now! You pointed me to the police, right! Air-hostess, as if! Wow! Wow! May you live long! You dance well! My daughter and me are pretty happy with your dance! Are you both happy? Really? Thank you! [RASPS] If you are happy... - ...then I am jovial too. - You, rogue! You, scoundrel! You, boisterous! Criminal! I'm not Saloni but Ratna! Get it? Bichhoo! Bichhoo? This is disrespectful! Even a flawed man has some values in him. You... ...try to understand. You get roses with the thorns. Roses turned red when thorns sucked it's blood. It is up to you anyway. In stead of Bichhoo,... ...you can call me a flower. Foolish! I know you well! I know why you escaped from Delhi! All this is your propaganda! It is you who has defamed me! Come! I will complain about you to the manager! Did you see, dad? He is involved with a new girl now. How can you trust such a man? - But still, a man must... - Lets go, dad! Mr. Shola, why did you come here? This is the best place to find a young man in this big city. - So, you think you will Munna right here? - Of course! Lets go. Act like a detective then. Please sit. Leave me! You are misunderstanding it. I neither committed a propaganda nor did I tell anyone. You will get me out of this job too. There you got me caught with cocaine. Now people will tell weird stuff if they see me with you. Why would you care? You'll get a large share out the gold confiscated from the train. Forget about gold and silver. We are in a critical situation right now. Where does this way lead... Yes, this way. Look, I'm going inside. You can leave after two minutes. Hello, inspector! Yes, he was here. If he comes again, I'll land in trouble. Please come at once. Yes. - Our prey has went it. - Here? Forget it, sir. Is this the place to look for someone? - Just get in! - Fine! Lets get in! I'll check. He is not here either. Is he here? Oh, no! You, silly! Imbecile! - You, blind! - Fine! I agree it's all me but I feel like becoming... ...deaf after listening to your language. It appears Tiger escaped after seeing Shola! It's possible. Can't blame him. He is hidden somewhere. Hey! So tiger was indeed inside. Sir, tiger is back! - No problem! - Just move, you silly! How dare you being disrespectful to your uncle! Excuse him! Mr. Shola, excuse him! Your dad turned blind and you forgot your parents after seeing gold worth millions? To hell with Munna and I don't care about my parents! Just return to that asylum from where you came! I'll slap you hard! You will get rid of your hooliganism! [GUNSHOTS] Bichhoo, my buddy! What have you done! Munna! What are you doing? Why are you shooting at him? Don't shoot at him! Don't act foolish! What are you doing? Don't act foolish! You can seek revenge later! I caught him, boss! - Boss, should I leave him? - Do not leave him! Boss, he slipped off my hands but you keep holding him. [POLICE SIREN WAILING] - [POLICE SIREN WAILING] - Did he slipped off your hands too? - What should we do about it now? - Indeed, boss. Boss, either this belongs to the cops or the thieves. Forgive me but you are not a thief. So give it to the police. - So lets give it to the police. - After you. Dear, you should have not insulted him. Jaidev is a very dangerous man. That's why people call him 'Bichhoo'. Saloni! Where are you heading? I'm heading out to wander off. - At this late hour? - So what? - Are you going to meet Bichhoo? - Absolutely! - He is my darling! - Saloni... How many times have I warned you... ...to stay away from that scoundrel! But you... Sister, you are jealous. You envy my love! - You envy my beloved, Jaidev! - Repeat yourself! Shameless! Sister! I have always cares about your well-being but you... That scoundrel keeps wooing around all the girls! Don't stop me, dad! - Lets go, dad. You may take rest. - Fine, dear. [WHISTLE] [WHISTLE] [FOOTSTEPS] [SCREAMED] Saloni, you know me, don't you? Once lit, it's tough to extinguish fire. Who wants to extinguish it? I do! That's impossible, Jay! The fire has spread equally... ...on both the ends! You can't extinguish fire using fire. Indeed, my love! No! I'm a small wave that's impossible to capture! You are like a thorn... ...which needs to be plucked and thrown out of heart! No! Let this thorn stay in your heart! Let it pierce till the depth of your heart! It will give you a light pain. This pain is better than the pain... ...that Sankat gave to Mr. Solanki and you... ...by snatching the gold consignment! How are you planning to retrieve the gold consignment from Sankat? Our secret information often gets leaked... ...to Sankat and his men. And Sankat works for 'Jwalamukhi Mandal'. How did he get this information? Answer me! You are a scorpion, after all. You cannot stay away from stinging. Just answer my question! An answer? The answer is stuck on my lips. It is quaking. Ask me, sweet-heart! Jay! Jay! [POLICE SIREN WAILING SOUND] Police! [CHUCKLES] So I have implicated the romeo! I'm the father of daughters. Who is in a vegetative state. How else could I have surveil their actions? This pain is better than the pain... ...that Sankat gave to Mr. Solanki and you... ...by snatching the gold consignment! How are you planning to retrieve the gold consignment from Sankat? - Inspector! - Get your complaint registered inside. Please hear me out. Jay! No! Please forgive me! This is my son's photograph. Is he in the lock-up? Lady, look for him in some cradle. This is a police lock-up. [GASPS] Just check this. It is his second photograph. She was looking for him in the police lock-up. Yes! This is my son's photograph. when in school, my son, Vijay used to secure a first place. He never misbehaved. Just check this out! Look, after he grew up, he has turned a bit naughty. - Vijay Chauhan? - Yes! [HUMS] He has never committed a crime! Sir, he has never committed a crime! My son never committed a crime! Just now he murdered three men at Nishat Hotel! What! You may ask her. She was also present there. No! I can't believe that he can commit a murder! No! Never! I can never believe that he could kill! No mother would believe that! But every son does commit a murder! Every son kills his mother's hopes! If he is in lock-up, just take me to him! I will slap him twice and... ...curse myself by thumping my chest! I will commit suicide in front of him! He will stop committing crimes after that! Well, he is... - ...still not caught yet. - [SOBS] But I've heard that he used to frequently visit Nishat Hotel. - Ms. Usha will give you all the details. - [SOBS] [SOBBING] [CRYING] I will tell you about him. - He is the manager. - She is here in search of her son. Look, here's the photograph of my son. Did you see it? He has become so mischievous after growing up. Did you see that? If I find him, I will take him home and tie him to the pole. We have never seen him here! Have you seen him around? - Have you or have you not? - No, I have not. - But you said that you have... - Look, ma'am. I think... ...everyone is sacred of him. My child! Everyone is scared of him! Mr. Manager, please allow me to stay here. I have an instinct that he will surely be here. Mr. Manager, please let me be here for sometime. This place is not meant for criminals. You might find them in your locality. Go and inquire Sankat, the master of all the criminals! You came to Bombay. You will find police here too. Moreover, even inspector Barua is here. Mom, but he is busy chasing Vijay Chauhan. So, what are your plans now? We are only left with one night now. We'll sell the microfilm at a maximum price... ...and get far away from India. Hello! 'Jwalamukhi Mandal'? Hello, Mr. Kapoor! We can't give the amount that you are demanding for a microfilm. Kapoor is heading to Bichhoo. Master, you should have purchased the microfilm from him. No! No need to do that! I will set Sankat behind Bichhoo and Kapoor. He will bring the microfilm. [TELEPHONE RINGING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello! Who? Yes? Bichhoo? Kapoor? Microfilm? Bring everything to me! And I will put Bichhoo inside the furnace and... No, not in furnace. Today I will kill him off for sure! Is that a deal? - Who? Vijay? - Get inside! - Did you bring the microfilm? - Yes, I have brought it. Here is that microfilm. - Give me. - What about money? Give me the money. Hey, you! [TIRE SCREECH] Drive faster! [TIRE SCREECH] Vijay, I want you to drive the car faster! [CAR ENGINE REVVING] - [GUNSHOT] - No! Welcome, Ms. Usha! Please sit! Check this out! Check them properly. Tell me, who did you see in the airplane? - They both are same, aren't they? - No, they are not the same. Inspector, either you get your eyes tested or... ...try to see through my eyes. Because I have a healthy eye-sight. I don't agree this time as visuals might deceive you too. One photograph belongs to Vijay Chauhan... ...and other belongs to Bichhoo. I don't believe that. In fact, it is possible that it is one... ...man who is working under two aliases. No, ma'am. It's because we have the fingerprints of Vijay Chauhan with us. And it doesn't match the finger-prints... ...to those we found at the airport. Now we need to reach Indrapuri Hotel and take the fingerprints of the person... ...who claims himself to be Bichhoo. - Shall we go? - Absolutely! I'm ready to come even if you don't take me. Okay. - There's one more point. - What is it? What if we ask Vijay Chauhan to be present there? What! To be honest, till we don't see them together... ...we can't be sure if they are two individuals. Amrita, give me 'Navbharat Times'! [PAPER RUSTLE] Vijay Chauhan. No matter where you are, do... ...reach Indrapuri Hotel tonight. You will be freed of all your problems. I'm a well-wisher. Who can this well-wisher be? This appears to be a trap by police. If you go, you'll be trapped! It's better to get trapped than live like this. [PAPER RUSTLE] Think about it once again. I have decided! Today, it is either... ...do or die! He is the one! He is the murderer! You? Bichhoo. Nice that I found you! Nice that... ...I found you. Where had you been? I had been struggling to find some light in life. I had been struggling to prove my innocence in the court of law. I had been trying to support my blind father in his old age. Well, even I... ...can become that. What? Just imagine. What if I... ...do all of this task? What if I prove my innocence? What if I support your... ...blind father in his old age? What do you say? You... What do you want? I want not just our faces but... ...our natures should also match. That's impossible. In that case, I will be compelled to commit one more murder. Looking at your corpse, world would think that Bichhoo is no more. But Bichhoo will live on. I will not let that happen. I will never let that happen. Things will happen... ...exactly how I want. [SONG] [SONG CONTINUED] [SONG CONTINUED] [SONG ENDED] [APPLAUSE] Sister! Tell me, Ratna! You, rascal! I know the reality of Bichhoo! Stay away from my sister! - What is wrong with you, sister? - Perhaps... ...your sister is... What did you say? [SCREAMED] [GROANING] Don't you mess with Bichhoo! Otherwise you will also end up like this. [SOBBING] - Please leave my sister! - [GROANS] - Please leave her! - [GROANS] - Hey! - [SCOFFS] Oh, ma'am! What were you secretly staring at? Who has sent you here? - Boy! - Tell me, sir? Bring her to my office. No, Mr. Solanki. Usha and me are looking for someone. After that we'll surely come to your office. Consider this hotel as your own, Inspector. Sorry, Ms. Usha! Ms. Usha was an air-hostess of the plane in which... ...Mr. Rustomji was murdered. She recognizes the murderer very well. - Oh, I see! - Boy! Where is Bichhoo? I got to know that some inspectors have been... ...sent to Bombay to investigate the gold case. I also know that inspector Barua has come here from Delhi. But after seeing him in this hotel, I suspect... ...he is here to nab you, Jaidev. - Did you commit anything wrong? - Not at all. Police couldn't even trace my fingerprints in the airplane. As I was wearing gloves. Police cannot harm me in Mr. Rustomji's murder case. As far as gold is concerned, it is not with us but with 'Jwalamukhi Mandal'. Now tell me. Do we need to worry about it? What if police saw you... ...when went to Roshan Kapoor... ...to get that microfilm? There's a problem with you, boss. You suspect of police everywhere. Police has not even seen my shadow yet! That's the specialty of Bichhoo! Your job is to sell microfilm and collect the money. You do your work and let Bichhoo do his own. - Where is it? - What? Where's the microfilm? Okay! About that microfilm? It is with me. You don't worry. It is safe... It is safe with me. And I will give you whenever you need it. Moreover, boss... I wanted to share an important matter with you. And the matter is... This girl is an accomplice of the police and is spying out here! No, Jay! You overheard our conversation, didn't you? But I will not share it with anyone. Jay, I will not share it with anyone. - Who has sent you here? - I know. You also know that I love you. I will never betray you! I will never betray you! No, my love! I hid here as I was scared. I'm telling the truth! - [GUNSHOT] - No! What have you done! She was an informer to Sankat. Let me go and check if inspector Barua hear the noise of the pistol. Just get rid of the corpse. And listen. Make sure no one recognizes by her attire that she used to dance at our cafe. Don't worry. I'll fix everything. Spies of 'Jwalamukhi Mandal' are present in this hotel. For time being, I'm worried about the inspector. We must move Saloni's corpse from here. Where is the inspector? - Is he in the dining hall? - No, he is not there. [FOOTSTEPS] - Where is the inspector? - He is near the swimming pool. [FINGER SNAP] Wow! Hello, gentlemen! Lets have food! - Hello! - Hello. You recognize the air-hostess, don't you? Sorry. I have never met her. Have you ever seen him before? [CHUCKLES] 'Coca Cola'? No, thank you! Would you like to smoke a cigarette? - No thanks. I don't smoke cigarette. - Oh! I have got his fingerprints on the cigarette case. Fine. Once police arrests him... ...you'll have to be there for identification. - Surely, I'll come. - 14. - Sagar Hotel. - Sagar Hotel. She is an air-hostess. She recognizes me. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello? Boss, I am, Sankat on the line. What did you say? Did you ask me to start wearing bangles? Boss! I am, Sankat on the line. I will surely kill Bichhoo today! What address did you mention? Pocket Road? 'Makaan Manjutala'! - [HANG UP THE CALL] - Here I come! Lets go! What will you do to him now, Sankat? You silly! I will throw him in brewery and make an alcohol out of him! Shall we accompany you, Sankat? You all sit here doing nothing! I'm your boss and I say that you all are cowards! Today I will take on Bichhoo! - Who is Sankat among you? - Who is she? Why? Do you need alcohol? Birju, give a bottle to this lady! Mister, what will I do with the alcohol? Just look at this. I'm his mom. Oh! He is extremely naive. Ma'am, I don't sell milk out here. Nowadays, milk is more expensive than the blood. He is a very nice guy. If he has escaped from school then look for him in some film company. Just look at him! He has turned naughty after growing up. I don't know why he hides from the police. I'm sure you have seen him in your locality. Yes, I have seen him but... ...he is our friend! We address him as Bichhoo. Mister, please take me to him. - God will be kind on you. - Sure, lady! I'm on my way to meet him. - Please take me to him as soon as possible. - Come along. - What is... Hey! - Go to hell! Hey! [SHUSHING] Munna has turned evil in the company of evils. Sankat is his enemy! We have looked for him everywhere in this village. It's so simple. If you've lost your goat, you must inquire the butcher. Lets go. Go and sit in it. - Boss! Look... - Lets go! - Boss, lets go! - [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING] Nab them! They have taken my motorcycle! Mister, where are you taking me? You want to meet Bichhoo, don't you? I'm taking you right there. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Who are you? Who do you want to meet? Who is it, Mary? Ma'am! So you got trapped in my plan! This will be considered as the confession to your crime. Vijay! My son! - Munna! - Munna! Vijay! No! Munna! Bichhoo is dead! He got killed! - Is the key? - Yes. Listen. I will search this room. Raju and you go to Bichhoo's home and search that place properly. You should return with tape-recorder and microfilm. - Go! - Fine, sir! Bichhoo? Bichhoo! Bichhoo! Bichhoo? Are you alive? Who is Maya? Bichhoo, what are you blabbering? Okay. Now I get it. It is your plan. You got someone else killed in the name of Bichhoo. So that he gets accused for all your crimes... ...and make you innocent. Am I right? Where are you going? I'm going to see him. - Do you know this lady? - Yes. - She is Mr. Shankarrao's wife. - What about Bichhoo? - He is his son. - Lets go! Sign on the papers and take away the corpses. Lakshmi? Did you hear that? They are... ...addressing our son as Bichhoo. Bichhoo! [CRYING] Hands up! I knew you will be here for sure. Simply come along with me otherwise... [FOOTSTEPS] People address you as Bichhoo. Who addresses young men... ...after animal names these days? Shankarao. Place your palm on your son and forgive him. Otherwise it would hurt Lakshmi's soul. Today your mom has left us. But I'm so unfortunate... ...that I'm left alive to listen to your misdeeds. Only God can forgive you. Being a father,... ...I can only punish my son. No! He is not my son! He is not my son, Vijay! Shankarao, what are you saying? My son's ear was pierced! He is not my son! He is not Vijay! Alright, Mr. Vijay Chauhan. I've brought you to the top at a right time. Had you met your dad,... ...then it would have spoiled our new plan. I hope you believe now that I'm innocent. We have got all the proofs. The fingerprints we got on Rustomji's corpse from Delhi airport... ...belongs to the corpse that is present in the morgue downstairs. People addressed him as Bichhoo. Inspector, then why did you bring me here like a prisoner? You have friendly relations with Roshan Kapoor's sister, Tara Kapoor. [LAUGHING] Inspector, this is not a crime. It is true that I did dance... ...along with Tara Kapoor. But I don't think Tara ever complained about it to the police. Why did you escape when we found government files with her? Roshan Kapoor clicked photographs of these government files and handed... ...over the microfilm to the traitors involved with our enemies through Bichhoo. These traitors conduct a business by selling the secrets of our defense and army. - It's not a sin to kill such traitors. - You are right. But usually such people end up killing each other. Mr. Chauhan, you are the security officer. It is your duty to confiscate... ...that microfilm from the traitors. Therefore you will have... ...to act as Bichhoo. Not just Bichhoo, you can make me do anything. But... ...for God's sake, don't make me a smuggler. Well, this... These things belong to Bichhoo. His real name was Jay. His name matches a lot with yours. Just remember. About the corpse... ...that is lying in the morgue downstairs. His real name is Vijay. And your name is Jay. Bichhoo. I'm only worried about your dad. Forget it, inspector. He used to scold me a lot. No! Not from there but from here. Please come. Mom? Mom! - Mom! - Vijay! Vijay, get back to your senses! She was my mom, inspector! Please let me go! What are you saying? you'll end up ruining our plan. Inspector, my mom has died! - Please don't stop me! Please let me go! - Vijay, come back to your senses! Get back to your senses! If this microfilm gets into the hands of our enemies... ...just imagine so many mothers would cry for their sons who are in the army. So many sons will cry for... ...their mothers, wives and daughters! They'll be attacked my enemy's bombs! Let people think that they've killed a wrong man. Vijay is dead! - [CRYING] - Bichhoo is alive! Understood? Bichhoo is alive! Goons have killed a wrong man. Ratna, Bichhoo is still alive! - Just read this! - He is my sister's murderer! I will not spare him! I will kill him off! [SONG] [SONG CONTINUED] [SONG ENDED] [GROANING] What's the need for this? Your stare is enough... ...to kill a person. [KNIFE STRIKE] [FOOTSTEPS] Let go off me! He killed my sister! You killed him, Solanki, you evil! With the help of that poisonous Bichhoo! Boss. Put her corpse inside the trunk... ...and dump it in the drainage! She is extremely dangerous. - She attacked me using a knife. - May you get jolted by lightning! You, shameless! You, ruthless! Poor girl used to love you. - But you... - I killed her, dear! I killed her! She thanked me while dying. Bichhoo! Who killed her? When? What nonsense! Boss, this girl has got out of her senses! She is blabbering! What proof does she have? If I get the tape-recorder that Saloni used to carry here. - That's the proof. - Boss. Saloni was indeed a dangerous thing. She used to secretly record our conversations. - Am I right? - Bichhoo. Where is that tape-recorder? My men said that you took it home. Boss, you have exposed everything. Now she will not sigh till she seeks revenge. She now knows that Saloni was caught recording our conversation and you shot her. Did I? You shot her, Jaidev! You shot her! - She kept saying that she loves you and you... - Okay! Speak softly. Don't shout so much. I was about to marry Saloni. If you tell everyone no dad will give me his daughter. Moreover my sister-in-law will announce it to the world. She can be made silent for life. What if you don't get that tape-recorder to me? Well, Mr. Solanki! - Don't forget that I am Bichhoo! - Where is the tape-recorder? Solanki, just now you said that... ...Saloni was killed while she was saying that she loves me. I used to love her too. I killed her just because you! She might be dead... ...but her voice got recorded in the tape-recorder. Sometime I feel at peace... ...when I hear her. You, ruthless! Liar! Betrayer! Love cannot be so dangerous. It is impossible! Move! Mr. Solanki, had I not been your well-wisher,... ...I would have fought people and hugged this criminal lady! Therefore her love is not false. Bichhoo! You have changed, Bichhoo! Since the time you got that microfilm... Since the time you got that tape-recorder,... ...you are changed. [STAMMER] Don't be silly! What are you saying? You neither brought the gold from Sankat... ...nor anything. You've done nothing! Do you need gold and tape-recorder? I'll bring both. What did I say? Knife! Boy! Go and bring a huge trunk. [MOANS] Let go off me! - You, evil! Let go off me, I say! - Shut up! Let go off me! You are in search of your sister, right? - I will fix your meet with her. - Mr. Solanki! I'm not Saloni to get scared of your threatening. I will surely seek revenge for my sister's murder! Understood? Is that so? Let me see who saves you from me. [CHUCKLES] - [CHUCKLES] - No! [SCREAMING] - No! - Listen! Open the door! The police is here! Open the door! There, inspector! She is that girl! She didn't pay my taxi fare! Please take from her! Take from her! - Oh, girl! - [WHINES] We taxi drivers are pretty naive but we don't spare... - ...the taxi fare. - Sargent, please ask her to give. He said you didn't pay him the taxi fare. Yes, I did. No, I paid it. Fine, I will pay him. Just take me out of here at once! But why do you look so scared? - And he was... - Sargent, the matter is that... ...she works at our cafe. If she has not paid the taxi fare... ...I'll pay on her behalf. Buddy, why do you take the pain? I'll make her pay it! - Sir, she is... - He is paying. Why do you have a problem? - Sargent, you didn't get it. - How much is the fare? - Please tell me. - Rs. 3.50 is the fare! - I will pay him! - Just go! Leave! Sargent, Rs. 3.50 is the fare. We passed through Girgaon and Malabar Hill. We passed through all those places. Go and follow him! Just kill him! Go! [SONG] [SONG] [SONG CONTINUED] [SONG CONTINUED] [SONG ENDED] [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello! Sankat, you fool! You have killed a wrong person! You, traitor! I have killed Bichhoo! Which one? I will cut you into pieces and serve it to the dogs! Take it easy, boss! My meat is so poisonous that... ...dogs will die as soon as they munch on me! Just tell me! Okay. In that flat? Don't you worry. I will send my men right away. [ALERT ALARM] [DOOR CREAKING] [SHUSHING] - Let the beast sleep. - [DOOR CREAKING] If he wakes up, he will kill us off! First kill him off! [REVOLVER RELOADING] [LAUGHS] What are you searching? Who sent you? Why did you come here? Tell me. - Tell me otherwise... - Hey! Why did you go there? Who had sent you? Look. There's no need to worry. If you honestly tell us the truth,... ...then it is our responsibility to provide you security. Your boss can't do any harm to you! I know what you... ...went to take today. You went to... ...take microfilm, right? - Speak up! - Yes! [WINDOWPANE SHATTERS] That microfilm is under our custody now. We know about the photographs it contained. - We also know who sent you. - Well... Tell me. Where is your boss, nowadays? Where is his den? Speak up! Close the window! [GUNSHOT] Inspector, surround this entire area and find out who shot from where. - Yes, sir! - [FOOTSTEPS] Police! Don't move! Sankat! - Where is the gold? - Oh, my God! I forgot about it. Hear me out, Bichhoo! I forgot about it! Well... Bichhoo! I don't have the gold with me. - What if I find it with you? - You will not find on me. - I know Bichhoo, but the gold is... - What are you doing? Just leave me! Why do you cry about the gold? Just forget it! Don't you know? That man in black killed your mom! - What! - Indeed! He is the one! Oh, just hear me out! Mister! Lallu! Kallu! Birju! Gokul! [TIRE SCREECH] [TIRE SCREECH] Hey! [TIRE SCREECH] [TIRE SCREECH] Where is Munna? Munna? - Vijay Chauhan! - There's no one by that name. You cannot bluff me like that. I know Vijay Chauhan alias Bichhoo is present here. Just throw him out! But you cannot treat me like this! I know Vijay Chauhan is here! I will demolish this hotel! [WHISTLING] Good morning, Mr. Solanki! Did you get the gold from Sankat? Sankat is dead now. Problem is that dead people don't carry gold with themselves. What about that tape-recorder and microfilm? Oh, drat! I forgot it. I will go and bring it right away. Someone is here to meet you upstairs. - To meet me? - [HUMS] - Come along. - Who is it? This blind man claims to be your dad. I think it's the new trick to seek donations. Earlier they used to come dressed as beggars. Now they come to us claiming to be fathers. Munna! Jaidev! I believe your dad died in the battlefield, right? Yes. He laid down his life in the battlefield. He was a brave-heart! I have high regards for the fathers... ...who sacrifice their lives for the nation. Unfortunate are those fathers,... ...who survive to witness the nation... ...being destroyed by their sons. - Shame on them! - Shankarao! Mr. Solanki, we have to no time to waste on such nonsense. - I'll take your leave! - Stop! Bichhoo, the son of a great father! Stop! Perhaps I made a mistake. All the scorpions look alike. I can't see my son Bichhoo... ...in this dark world of mine! A scorpion's sting can... ...make a blind man suffer too. It can make a blind man suffer too. But you will not sting me! You are not Bichhoo! You are my son, Vijay! What nonsense! I'm not Vijay but Jaidev! [CHUCKLES] This old-man is clinging on to me. Mr. Solanki, you know well that my dad died in... That's a lie! It's not true! Your dad was hanged to death! How did you forget that? Fine. But should I announce this to the world? In case if you are not his son,... ...then kick him out of here! Forget it, boss! He is a blind old man! Jaidev, don't consider me as blind. I want to know about your real identity! Do you want to know about me? Boss, I will sting you once... ...and that will be enough for you to remember that I'm Bichhoo! Vijay! What are you doing? [SCREECHES] - [SCREECHES] Just get out of here! - Oh! You are extremely disrespectful! - I wish, I met you in Lucknow. - Hear me out at least! Oh, God! Why am I getting punished? Get lost! I've become a loner now. I have no one. Where should I go? Jaidev! I don't think this old man will go that easily. Stop! Do you still refuse to recognize him? I've told you so many times. How should I prove it to you? Kick him down the stairs! Vijay! [LAUGHING] - Listen! - Yes? Yes? You should bring that tape-recorder and microfilm today. Otherwise I will gouge out your eyes too! Go! No... I have no son! I have no son! I have no son! [CRYING] Now you tell me that you don't have a son! - Hey! - [SCREAMING] Mr. Shola! Please come at once, Mr. Shola! - Just come here at once and see! - Solanki! - Hey! - [SCREAMS] [SCREAMING] Hands-up! Shut up! - Move! - Raphael! Gulam! Beat him up, Mr. Shola! Thrash him! Just beat him up! Hit him more! Beat him as much you want! Harder! Harder! Stop it! No! - Get up. - Banne! - Yes? - Banne, what is happening there? Nothing much. Solanki is getting beaten up! No one will move! Bichhoo? Lets go, Shankarao! Move! Which mean that I was wrong. My philosophy to reach the powerful using the goons was wrong too. When do we seek help from the goons? You should inculcate good values in the children. - So that when they grow up... - And don't become goons or thief. Banne, I was leading a wrong path till today. And I was misguiding others too. But today I realize... ...that our ancestors were right. What did they say? You must choose a right path to reach the right destination. You cannot gain anything through violence. Therefore it would be right... ...if we permanently put an end to 'Jwalamukhi Mandal'... ...who have spread violence in this nation. But, Mr. Shola! What do you mean by 'Jwalamukhi Mandal'? Sir, he keeps drinking and crying the entire day! Oh... You shouldn't cry like that. He thrashed my blind dad! I will not spare Solanki! He kicked my dad! He insulted him and I... I will shoot down Solanki! Did you call me from far for that? Who will explain... ...that poor blind dad? Law is also blind, isn't it? Who will explain it? Did you get the microfilm? Even Solanki asked me the same thing. Did you get the microfilm? I have nothing to gain from Bichhoo's plan! Then there's a tape-recorder! Bring the tape-recorder, at least. Perhaps we could get a proof from it. But after her death... You have a pistol in your pocket. I have kept one in your coat. Go. Perhaps, it will be... ...better if I die! Listen. Present? A beautiful present. Just like you. It's my weakness. [CORK OPENS] You didn't ask me why I... ...have come into your room. Either an enemy or a friend can come inside a room without information. An enemy comes to attack. And friend comes to love. I'm ready for both. To accept or reject depends on the mood of your beloved. Your beloved doesn't intends to be your enemy... ...but a friend. Here's your first step into the world of friendship. It's not the thirst to... ...drink, but to love. What is this? Next step. No! The one who takes quick steps... ...end up falling. I have a habit of falling. I take a sigh only after reaching my destination. If you reach your destination,... ...you will fall prey to your weakness. I'm not a prey... ...but a hunter! [CHUCKLES] On missing a shot,... ...hunter turns into a prey. [CHUCKLES] What if the shot... ...doesn't get missed? To accept or reject... ...depends on the mood of your beloved. Why did you still not bring the microfilm and tape-recorder? This is not how you should speak to Bichhoo! Mr. Solanki, now it's time for you experience the sting of a scorpion! Tell me. Where is the tape-recorder and microfilm? Otherwise I will kill you off! You cannot harm me till you get... ...the tape-recorder and microfilm! Go and search his flat! Solanki, today I will settle my account with you! You have kicked me! I will damage your eyes! No! Help! [FOOTSTEPS] I had said I will gouge out your eyes that day. Where is that tape-recorder and microfilm? Tell me! Jay, you don't know that I love you a lot. I will never betray you! No, I will never betray you! No, my love! I hid here as I was scared! I'll be honest! No! [GUNSHOT] What have you done? She used to leak information to Sankat. Ratna. - I want to tell you something. - Stay right there! Please don't shoot me. [GUNSHOT] Hear me out, at least! [GUNSHOT] - Stop there! - Those are empty bullets! - There is no gunpowder in it. - No! But there are bullets in my pistol, Solanki! Do not touch the tap-recorder! I have heard everything! I've got the proof. Arrest them all! - Do not let Bichhoo run! - How will he run? Law has taken cases of many scorpions like him! Who are you? What do you want? You will have to accompany us. My beloved! Just give that purse to me! No! [GASPS] If I don't get that microfilm... Let go off me! [GROANS] No! Mr. Vijay, you will not find microfilm inside the purse. I know that. Otherwise she would have not left this purse like that. Microfilm is with me. Really? Where is it? It's not here. It is at 'Jwalamukhi Mandal'. You will have to come along. Why not? This gives pleasure to me. I anyway wanted to... ...meet those gangsters. - Come. - What's the matter? - Inspector, Bichhoo! - Oh! Yes. He escaped the police lock-up. - Did he attack you? - I somehow saved myself! Sargent, look all around. He tried to kill me because of that microfilm. What is this microfilm? - This is it. - This one? Yes! I did find something like this from the tape-recorder... ...that I stole from Bichhoo's flat. - Where is it? - I have kept it safe with me. Please give me. It would be better for you. Fine. Please come along. What happened? I can't hear a voice in it now. I had seen the same microfilm... ...that you had shown me. It was place in a similar box. I wonder who took it. - Who else stays here? - My dad and me. Jugal Maharaj. Is he your dad, Mr. Jugal Maharaj? Yes. He has been handicapped since many years now. I will go and ask him if anyone came here. Dad... Dad! Where did he go? Where did he head to? He can't move on his own. - Somebody must have abducted him. - Who? The one who took the microfilm. [TELEPHONE RINGING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello! What! Shankar? Who are you? He said, "Boss, I am, Shankar." He hung the call as soon as he heard me. Mr. Barua, here! Give me commissioner of police. Thank you, sir! I didn't knew the address of 'Jwalamukhi Mandal'. I will go right away and search that place. Mahabali. She has a misconception. Actually, I escaped from the lock-up so that you all... Lock him along with dad and daughter at a place... ...where the police can arrest the trio. Mahabali, it's a nice move but... Now... You thought that you have bluffed me. You brought me here by luring about the microfilm. Sorry, sister! I know the whereabouts of microfilm. Stop! We need that microfilm! We needed that microfilm. You will get it right away, Mahabali. We need it, Mahabali. Sankat is missing. No one knows if he is alive or dead. You. Come here! Tell me. How much money will you take? Rs. 100000? Rs. 200000? Rs. 500000 or Rs. 1000000? Stop! This man is a fraud! Absolutely a fraud! I have microfilm with me. Check this out! Now give the entire gold, names of members and photographs to me! Now I am, Mahabali and here is the microfilm. It's fake. If you don't believe me then you may ask Tara. She has the real microfilm. Check this out. Jugal Maharaj! Bichhoo, who killed my daughter, Saloni! He is the one! Tell me, you, evil! [GUNSHOT] Throw away the revolver and give me the microfilm. Throw it away! Police! Jugal Maharaj? [HUMS] Tara Kapoor and her mom. Traitor! You know well about microfilm, don't you? Did Jugal Maharaj brought it? Microfilm has been burned. Really? Who burned it? The Mahabali of 'Jwalamukhi'. He burned it in the fire of 'Jwalamukhi'. The members of the party killed him. Mr. Shola? Mr. Brijnarayan Shola threw away all these books. He used to teach boys earlier. So many books? How did he turn into demon then? Mr. Shola snatched the gold... ...stolen in the train... ...from Solanki's goons... ...and hit it here. [HUMS] Mr. Shola must not be directly involved in it. No. In stead of bandits or goons... ...he used to get things done by the kids. It contains the name and address of the members of 'Jwalamukhi Mandal'. Some names will shock you. A lot. No one would believe it either. This list... ...contains the names of the members of 'Jwalamukhi Mandal'. I've spoke to home minister. He is going to Delhi in the evening flight. Fine. Bichhoo! Mr. Shankar, no one is present here. Really? There used to be a lot of books here. There is nothing out here now. Everything is clean! - Mr. Banne! - Yes? Listen. Someone is coming this way. Not one. I think many are coming. Come along. Come. Where are we? No matter where we are but it is not safe to stay here! Police can come here anytime. - Hello! - Inspector. Mr. Barua is leaving to Delhi by train at 10.30 p.m. - Oh! - [HUNG UP THE CALL] What did I just hear? Number seven said that... ...by 10.30 p.m.'s train... ...Mr. Barua will... ...leave to Delhi along with Home Minister with a secret file. Boss, what can we do? Our names have already reached to the police. Yes. And we have no other choice but to blow up the train. - But who will blow up the train? - Bichhoo is there to do that. Around 11.30, this train will reach Safedpur... ...passing through Davayya. Next to it is a cabin. We need to hijack it and explode the cabin. Things will happen exactly how you want. Yes. Just remember one more thing. Home minister's special compartment... ...is the last compartment of the train. Train must explode when that last compartment... I understood everything. - How much will I be paid? - You be rest assured. You will be paid Rs. 100000, once you are done with the task. - Then consider it done. - It sounds like Vijay to me! Lets go. No! I will not let it happen! Mr. Banne, take me to Vijay. Today you will witness... ...how I will kill my own son! Only train will be there. Now just wait and watch. There are cabin on both the sides of the bridge. After half an hour of me leaving, you will hijack the left side of the cabin. Yes. Till then I will... ...fit the dynamite charge and run towards the cabin. The train will be given a green signal from there... ...and train will explode there. They both are apt for this job. - I will accompany you. - No! Well, cabin man might... ...suspect if more than one man goes. But you are leaving the dynamites right here. They have turned pretty old. Therefore I have brought new ones. Check this out. I will not take a chance today. - Okay? - Alright. Good luck! Sankat! Yes. Sankat! The one who you had attacked. Sankat, he is Bichhoo! Indeed. It doesn't cares if it is friend or enemy while stinging. It seems you have lost your senses because of that sting. If I keep listening to your nonsense, I'll miss the train. You cannot bluff me any-more. With that Solanki... Solanki is in the jail. How did you reach here? You, rogue! You are neither Solanki's aide... ...nor ours. You are a policemen's aide! Perhaps that's why he left the dynamite. [SCOFFS] You... I will harm you so badly... So badly that you'll not... ...forget even after your death! Mr. Banne! Where are you? Wait. I am coming. - Hurry up! - I'm coming. Look. It's just one way. Whoever passes this way... ...will make contact to this rope and you will know him. Mr. Banne. Go to the railway guys and alert them. Uncle! - How can I leave you alone and... - Don't worry about me and leave. I don't care about my life today. - Just go! - Okay. Your dad is dead now. In fact, I can't even cry about your antics. - Dad! - Silence! Such son who address as dad should be cursed. When a son grows up... ...he makes his dad feel proud. - But you... - Hear me out at least. Shut up, you traitor! Parents who deliver children like you... ...become enemies of not just people but the nation too. Dad, I am a patriot! Neither am I a criminal nor a murderer! But please believe me! Remove inspector Barua's letter from my pocket and read it. You are the head of criminals that attack the vehicles. After making your dad blind,... ...you are asking me to read the letter of Mr. Barua. You are demanding me... ...to take out the letter from pocket and read it. Have you hurt your hands? - How can I tell you? My hand... - I wish it was broken. There wouldn't have been any issues then. Dad, you have no idea. - If your shot had hit me,... - If I had pistol in my hand... ...I would have already shot you! - You would have died like a dog! - Shoot and kill me! But remember this. You will not have anyone to save them. Here. What is it? You gave me the pistol by picking up with your mouth. - Are you poking fun at your dad? - No, dad! No! My hands are broken! They got exploded! Those criminals broke my hand... ...and have gone to explode the bridge! [HUMS] Did you make a deal with each other? - Was it for Rs. 100000? - No, dad! I will... - No use... - Beware! If you move, I will shoot you! I will not leave you. I was thinking... ...how can I save the bridge without my hands. But God has sent you to me. Not your eyes... ...but your hands. Dad... My eyes and your hands can save this bridge together. There's no other way. Dad, we are running out of time. [TRAIN HORN BLARING] [TRAIN RUMBLING] - Who are you? - [TRAIN RUMBLING] [TRAIN HORN BLARING] [TRAIN RUMBLING] [TRAIN HORN BLARING] - Oh! Hey, Nathu! - Yes? Did you connect the wire of dynamite or not? Yes, it is connected. Okay. So this is case! - Hey! - [GROWLS] Who is it? What's the matter? What is happening? Hey! Vijay! [GRUNTS] Oh! [TRAIN RUMBLING] - It's time for the train to arrive. - I'm coming! What? Vijay! Hey! What are you doing? [TRAIN RUMBLING] Vijay, I have reached. Now you may leave the rope. I will climb down. Here. Pull the rope up. Hey, Vijay! Vijay! Where are you? Vijay! Vijay! - Vijay! - Dad! - Vijay! - Dad! - Where are you, son? - Vijay! Are you here, Vijay? [TRAIN RUMBLING] [TRAIN HORN BLARING] [TRAIN RUMBLING] Dad, we are running about of time. It was right here. We must now move the dynamite from beneath the bridge. Yes. Okay. Carefully. [TRAIN RUMBLING] Dad! Dad, I found the dynamite! It is right here. Come here with... ...the help of my body. Fine. [TRAIN RUMBLING] [SHUSHING] Now move your hand towards the dynamite! Now try to reach till there. Not that hand but this hand. [TRAIN RUMBLING] Oh! [TRAIN RUMBLING] Try harder! Oh, no! Dad! - Dad! - [WATER SPLASHING] No! - [WHINES] - [MARCH PASS] [SCOFFS] What an age is this! It's an evil age! Cheater! Criminal! Murderer! Bandit! [KNOCK ON THE DOOR] Who is it? Inspector! Nice that you are here. Everyone have turned blind. Nothing is happening right. Okay! What has happened? Government is giving medals to criminals! Is that it? I'm here to explain that. Please come. Dad. World doesn't knows it. But I know. You sacrificed your own life to safeguard the country. Therefore it not me but you who deserve to... ...be respected. Please take it. Please accept it. You had promised me... ...that you will be my hands. Without you, who will... ...be my hands in this life? Is that it? Ratna. Ratna. [HUMS] Vijay. My hands will never stop supporting you for life. - Never! - Really? [SONG PLAYING IN BACKGROUND]
