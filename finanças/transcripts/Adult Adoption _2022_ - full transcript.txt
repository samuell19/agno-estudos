I know Susan was much-beloved here, and I look forward to getting to know you all. Oh. Now, you guys have a great day. So, I see that you tried to do the transfer online, but since it's a large amount it got flagged. If you answer some security questions, I should be able to get that in for you, no problem. You sound super familiar. Okay. Um, so the name of the street you grew up on? Oh, God, why would I have made it that? Uh, Princess Street? Correct. Hey, did you used to live there? At the group home on Princess? Um... Yeah, actually. Why? Oh my God, is this Rosy? -Yeah. - No way! Oh my God, Rosy, you work at the bank? Girl, it's Nola! Hi! Yeah, I'm surprised you recognize my voice. Well, you were pretty memorable. You didn't recognize my name? Here, hold on, I'll send you a selfie so you can see what I look like right now. Wait, is this your real number? Text me from your real phone. Okay. So, did you do independent living after that? Um... Yeah, I did. Did you? Oh, one sec, I'm taking a selfie for you. So, my fosters adopted me, technically, but we don't talk anymore. It's okay. I've actually found belonging with a new family. That's why I need to transfer some money to their account. Um, okay. Um, right! I can help you with that. Um... So what's the name of the account you're transferring to called? Is it a checking or a savings account? Uh, I think it's a business account. -But it's a family thing? -Yeah. Like a church that's like a family. Okay. Yeah, if you're sure. I like your dress. You look great, by the way. Now that we have each other's numbers, we should get coffee sometime. There's a place I love on Richmond. Yeah, maybe coffee. I mean, I'm gonna be pretty busy with this family stuff, but...

We're sharing an office? Is that not good? No, it's fine! It's good! It's not you, I just... don't like change. I hope you girls aren't complaining about me! We aren't. Okey-dokey. Oh, relax! He was kidding. I think. I have to make this right! -Oh, Rosy. -I'm sorry! It's fine. I was kidding. I'm cool if you are. Rosy, are you cool? Yes. Okay. Listen, I'm new to this job. Still trying to figure things out. You don't have to try to please me. It's clear you do your job well. Just, uh... Hey, relax. It's all good. Yes, it is. Rosy, you okay? I've never seen you this way. We get benefits. Maybe you should see a therapist? Or call your mom. I talk to mine every day. I know. - I was supposed to see a therapist... - but I aged out. I'm sorry, sorry, what are we talking about? Never mind. Aged out? I've never heard that before. Aged out of what? Like, the system? What system? The foster care system. Oh. Ohh! Oh! You were a foster kid in foster care? Yeah. Wait, what? Yeah. Shit! So your parents are, like, foster parents? Um, no. I aged out. I turned 18. I'm not adopted. Oh, right. Okay, cool. So, who's, like, your family now? Yeah, I mean, I guess, like... - my friends and the people here. Well, that must be hard because the people here suck. And I mean, you'd never know. You're, like, thriving! You know? Like, like... phew! Okay, I'm gonna Google some statistics. Oh! No, no, no, that's okay. -You don't have to-- -No, you're incredible. "Foster care system, its victims." "Emotional consequences." Holy shit. There was only a 5% chance you were gonna finish post-secondary! Uh, that's a win in my books. See, impaired brain development, physical, emotional-- God, PTSD? Oh, girl, wow, you don't have addiction issues, right? -No. -Social difficulty. You don't have any of this! Incarceration. Reckless or violent behaviors. I mean, that thing just now, that doesn't count. Uh, unemployment? No. Loneliness... Wow, you're doing great with most of this! All this time... I thought you were just a basic blonde girl who loved her job. Thank you. - Ah! -You're more likely to murder someone if you were in foster care. Well, not you, but just people generally. Mostly if you're male, though apparently since 2010 the gender homicide gap is closing. Ladies be killin' it! Can you just get adopted now? I'm an adult, so no. I'm sure if you Google it, it's a thing. Everything is a thing. I think maybe for, like, cults. I found a lot of support online when I was getting over my eating stuff, and if you found parents, you'd have something to talk about with a therapist, and you could go to therapy and work on... whatever that just was back there. It said on that list, one of the symptoms of being a grown-up foster kid was loneliness. What? That's not... I'm not. I mean... like, I have other ways of dealing with that. Like dating. You date? So, you like the coffee here? Let me get that. So, is there a reason why you chose this place for our date, which is closing soon? I live upstairs. Do you have a condom? I don't, no. I didn't know we'd end up at yours so fast. I only met you there to make sure you weren't gonna kill me. -You aren't, right? -No! Great! I'll get a condom. I have one. Okay, wait, hang on, hang on! Uh... Can I just be with you for a sec? Mm-hm! Yeah? You're really sensitive to touch, eh? Yeah, I guess. Either that or I don't feel anything. I'm getting the condom. I can't open them, though. You have to do it. Open it. Yeah. Can't open a condom. Great. Now take your shirt off. -Mmm. -Are you okay? Rosy? Rosy, are you-- are you-- -Are you passed out? -No, I'm not. Rosy, I was inside you, fucking you, and you passed out, right? I was-- are you-- hello? Hey. Look, I know I didn't roofie you. I'm not a rapist. Am I just bad at sex? If you're bad at sex, you just get better at it. Am I bad at sex? No. No, sorry, no. Do you have some sort of condition? No! God, no, I wish. No. No, it's just I never take these sleeping pills I have and I took them when I got the condom and I guess it hit me hard. You're not bad, really. I was enjoying myself. Why would you take a sleeping pill before having sex with me? That's like roofieing yourself. Yeah! Honestly, I have an intimacy thing, I think. You're not a rapist and you're not bad at sex. I just meant unlike rapists, at least people who are bad at sex can fix that. I'm sorry. You don't think sex offenders can be rehabilitated? No, I mean, I guess... -Yeah, I do. -Not to say that I am one. Or was one. Of course. I just think some people didn't get what they needed and they can go out and get it. Everyone can be rehabilitated. Sex offenders. You know, you too. Thanks. Yeah, I'm really sorry, again. Obviously that won't happen again. -Yeah. -Yeah. Thank you. Sorry, sorry. Rosy? Yes. Brian? -Hi. -Hi! You found the place okay? -Yeah. -Great. Uh, please sit. Alright, here we go. I've-- I've had those, the crackers, yeah. Do you want one? -Yeah! -Here you go. Thanks. That's really nice of you. Anyway, just, I always hoped that I would meet a... like, a partner with grown kids, because I never wanted to do any of the baby stuff, you know? So I was on the site for a while and just looking around, and people on it, you know, they seemed normal, not trying to rip me off or anything. Um, so anyway, I met a young guy on the site about a year ago. He was great. His name was Sean. We did all kinds of father-son stuff. We went to ball games, that kind of thing. But he was 19. He went abroad to go to university. He's in Sydney now. We still email, sometimes. He's, uh... Anyway, he's great. He was... -That's great. -Mm-hm! You're the first person that I've met like this. Oh, yeah? Yeah. And so far, so good! I just really like those colors, you know? - Yeah! - Yeah. Thanks a lot. Thanks. Oh, no, no, please, I'm an adult. Well, yes, of course, but no. I mean, come on, that's not what this is. If you were my, you know, my child, then I wouldn't expect you to pay. And that's what this is supposed to be, so fair's fair. Right? Can I give you a ride? Oh, no, that's okay. I can take the bus. Okay. Thank you very much for dinner. Yes, I'd love to do it again sometime. Whenever you're free, kiddo! Is it okay that I called you "kiddo"? I mean, I would ordinarily never call a grown woman, a young woman who's grown, an adult, you know, "kiddo." But given the way we met and... -No, it's totally fine. -Great. And listen, you shouldn't feel the need to be exclusive with me. If you want to, you know, reach out to other people on the site, I'm okay with that. Thanks, and you, too. Great. Nice to meet you, Rosy. Rosy, the woman you were helping with the transfer over the phone yesterday... Yeah? You didn't actually complete her money transfer. Sorry, I, uh... I was having an off day. Did you want me to complete that now for you? Um, actually no, hold off. I'll get to it. This is very nice. It's a good choice. Thanks. I mean, I could not believe that it was you. I mean, I've been thinking about this sweet girl who hugged me right when I needed it. I wanted to know more about you. I just didn't know if it was appropriate, ha! Do you have any kids yourself? Real ones? Why do you think I was crying that day? I didn't want to ask. I have a daughter. We are estranged, unfortunately. Um, how old are you? Twenty five, you said? Yeah, Alice is 29. Married, which is why we're estranged, if you ask me. Hmm! Do you talk to your dad, darling? Oh! Uh, no. Um, he was never in the picture, then my biological mom died when I was young, three. -I'm so sorry. -That's okay. Then I had a grandma who was next of kin but quite old, so she went into a retirement home and I went into the system when I was six. Oh, wow. It's fine. I wasn't really beaten or raped or anything like that, so, yeah! I got that going for me. -Well, that's great! -Mm-hm! Are you married? No. Was. Not anymore. Nope, single now. Hm, cool. -And what do you do? -I'm a high school teacher. -Do you like that? -Nope! I love it. I do. Oh, teenagers, though, whew! They grow up so much faster than when I first started, which I'm not saying is necessarily a good thing or-- you just need to be wherever you are at. Yeah. Okay. I'm going to go to the washroom, and then we're getting cake! Everything good with you both? Oh, yeah. Thanks, yeah. My mom is just in the washroom. Helen? Oh? Oh, um, if you're wondering about these, they're to manifest employment opportunities. I want to be farther ahead professionally. My mom says I just need to be patient, though. Cool. Hey, I, um... I Googled that thing that you told me to. You were right, it's a thing. I've been, like, meeting older adults who want, like, relationships with younger ones. Girl, what?! That's amazing! Have you met anyone yet? Yeah. This one woman, Jane. Ooh, I don't know! Should I text her? Oh, no. No, let's just wait to see her tomorrow. Oh, girl! Show me the place where you found these people. Okay! There's a man, too, but I think I need a mom more. Although both a mom and a dad, like the full set, would be ideal. Oh, girl, I am so proud of you. Jane is her name. I just... I just want to be, like, really, really good to her. Right. And, uh... And how are you gonna do that?

I met with another young woman from the site a few days ago. She's 20, but, my God, she seems decades younger than you, Rosy, not just five years, and it made me realize you're impressive. You don't seem like you need somebody to take care of you. You're doing it yourself. Thanks. Sorry, that was bugging me. Yeah, I'm kind of a perfectionist about things, too. My hair, weirdly. How is my hair? Is it okay? - Looks great. - Phew! Good. You have nothing to worry about. Neither do you. So, are you seeing anybody? No. So, um... I, uh... hmm. Okay, this is, uh-- no, Rosy, look, I really do want to support and mentor a young person who needs my help. But like I said before, you, um... you don't seem to need it, so-- Oh, no, no, you've only met me an hour. I'm actually really unstable. -Oh! -Mm-hm. Okay. Um... What I was gonna say is that you seem more like my peer and that we have a lot to talk about, and I was gonna ask you out. Oh. Yeah, sure! -Really? -Yeah. Well, alright. Cheers. -So... -So... So, ordinarily right now, um... I'd give you a little, you know, peck on the lips. Just a terrible word, "peck." Just-- and then you could make it more if you wanted to make it more. I mean, if this were, you know, like a... a "date" date, which, you know, I kind of-- that's where it ended up, I feel, you know? But given how this night started when we went through that door, I mean-- Uh... Okay, then! -Uh, see ya. -See you. Nola! Sorry, I thought that you were somebody else. Hi, beautiful girl, it's me. I hope you had a great evening last night, whatever you got up to, and I hope you have a great day today. I'll talk to you soon, darling. Message will be saved for 14 days. Like, how far did you get, you know? Um, like, bases? Like, yeah, like, how far on the bases? Um... -One? -Okay. Okay! I don't know, it was long and hard. With, like, your dad. Um... But I thought you liked the Tinder Dan guy. I do, but... I don't know! I never texted him again, and then last night I just sort of... went for it. You, um, you went for it, or... you went with it? I don't know! That's a good question. Um, hey, so by the way, - I gotta tell you something. - Um... I got offered a position at corporate, and it pays almost twice what I make now. It's the professional step up I've been hoping for, so... Yeah, I, um... I'm gonna start there next Monday. Helen, that's great! Congratulations. Thank you. Oh? Yeah, yes! I'm so proud of you.

I mean, you're kind of past that, no? Past what? Past needing a mommy and a daddy. You're 25 years old. Have you met with other people from the site recently? No, actually, though I would. Why? Well, because-- look, you're my peer. You're my equal. But guys, I think they grow up slower. I think from now on I'm only gonna meet with guys, and only under 25, because otherwise it's weird. So I'm weird? I'm past it, I missed my chance? Hang on, what are we talking about? You're 25 years old. You've missed absolutely no chances. Take it from me. Am I missing something here? You think that it's bad that I met with a woman from the site. No! No, not bad. I just didn't think you needed that. That's all. I mean... when I think of you, I think that you're all grown up. That's all. And I mean that in the best way, obviously. I mean, I find you incredibly fascinating. I find you just so sexy. I can't even-- You don't really know me, though. But I'm enjoying getting to know you. Have you dated other girls that you met on Adult Adoption? No. Of course not! What the fu-- Are you mad at me for something? -No, no! -Did I do something? -No, I just-- -Yes, you are! You're angry with me for some reason. I'm not! I just have to go, I'm sorry. Wait, wait. Rosy, I'm sorry. You have nothing to be sorry for. -Why? -It's not you, I just... I've been doing all the things, I've been keeping myself busy, I've been saying yes... but I feel like I can't hang onto anything. Well, God, Rosy... hang onto me! Is this okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I gotta go. I'm sorry. Have a nice night. Hi! Hi. Hi, you've reached Jane. I'm unavailable at the moment, but if you leave a message, I'll call you back. Be well. Oh, hi, Jane. It's me. I was just hoping to catch you. Thanks for last night. That was great. But I had a weird day, like, a new office mate. Yeah, I wanted to tell you about it and, you know, hear your voice. I, uh... love you... and I'll talk to you soon. Bye. Someone came in here looking for you the other day, a girl like you. Said she'd gone by your work, too, looking for you, but was nervous that she would run into some man there. Nola. I don't know her name. I don't even know your name, but... I knew she meant you, though. How? -Because I know you. -What, no! Yeah, you make yourself known. I see you going on your sugar packets and I pick up all your bits of paper, but I say nothing! If I'm not careful, the sugar spills everywhere. Were you in a car accident? No! Why does everyone ask me that? You need to go back to yoga. You have not come in with your mat lately. It's good for your fine motor skills. They're fine, actually, since I started knitting. And your general sense of calm. Do you always think something bad is going to happen? Like her. You think she is bad? You are clearly dealing with something and so is your friend. -I hope she is okay. -Wait, what? -Give me the money! -Oh, my God! Open the fucking register! Okay, okay. Just calm down. Okay, okay. It's okay. Give her what you have. Thanks for the help. Sorry he's jumping down your throat. It's not cool. That's not-- I'm not helping her, I'm just trained in... -Go lock the door. -Are you okay? It wasn't that much money, I don't think. You're late. Sorry. There's someone here to see you. Um, please sit down. Nola, as I believe she's known to you, called here in service to her family. Yes. Where is Nola? Okay, I'll complete that transfer for you, no problem. Are you gonna do the transfer? No. Okay. I'm gonna go have a little chat with Mark. The number you have reached is not in service. Please hang up and try your call again. This is a recording. Siri, play voicemail. Siri, voicemail. Hi, beautiful girl, it's me. I hope you had a great evening last night, whatever you got up to. Rosy, hi. What are you doing here? -They said it was an emergency. -It is, it is. My friend, Nola, the girl who I think is in a cult, fuck, I don't know what to do, and... Okay, also, Jane isn't answering my calls. Rosy-- Um, sorry. Jane? Jane not answering your calls, that's not an emergency. But maybe the other thing is, though. Why don't you check on Nola? We'd have her address on file at work. Your work, I mean. How long has it been with Jane? A couple days. I know. -Rosy! -I know, I know! It's just I don't know what to do. You're just a champ, Helen. The best. You can help me. Yeah, okay. Well, you don't like change, I know, and we don't work together anymore, but we can still hang out sometime. What? No. It's not that. It's that... I'm not even a real person. You are a real person. -I'm pretty sure. -I'm not! I'm sorry, but what does that even mean? I'm not real! I'm not anyone's kid. I can't fucking do this. I'm just so fucking empty. Rosy, everyone's emp-- Everyone is empty. No one, no one feels like a whole person, I don't think. And you, you have a really solid reason to feel that way, but that just means you need to get less bogged down in it. You're the one who told me to go online and do this. You're the one who made this a thing. I didn't make it a thing. It was a thing before I pointed to it and I said, "Oh, look, there's a thing." I... I was trying to help. I thought by pointing it out, it might let you deal with it, and-- and-- and I was trying to-- I-I'm sorry, everyone's trying! But I'm sorry that you were never the center of anyone's world, and I'm sorry, you cannot be the center of mine now! Just st-st-st-st-st-stop! Screw you. I really care about you, Rosy. Rosy? Yeah? I have to get back to my day. So why don't you text that guy or something? Because I have to get back. I really care about you, Rosy. Hi, you've reached Jane.

I know it's not the same thing, but... I grew up without a dad, and I had to teach myself how to shave. And? What? -Did you? -Yeah. Look at my face. It's shaved. Oh, yeah. Uh, how did you do that? -YouTube. -Right. I think now is not a great time for me to have a boyfriend. Yeah, I'm gonna have to agree with you on that. Yeah. I'm gonna leave. Yeah, totally. You have to go to work anyways, don't you? I'm actually taking today off. Oh, okay. There's something I have to do. -You. -Hello. I'm looking for Nola. Hmph! Where's the money? Yes, I work at the bank. I just need to get some information from Nola. So, is Nola here? You can tell her that she has a guest. Rosy? Hey. Would you like to come inside? Sure. Nola? It's okay. I'm very happy here. Can you get me my money back? Nola, I didn't do the transfer. We can get you out of here. I can call the police. No, no, I mean, it's not like they're making me stay here. Aren't they? No, I can leave. We're not kids anymore, Rosy. We can do what we want. That guy seemed right up in there. Who is he? He's, um... Okay, fine, I have no idea what I'm doing with my life, but it's fine. I think I don't want to have a baby, but... They want you to have a baby? Yeah, but, I mean, it's not that weird. He's just a person. Yeah. Yeah, he's just a per-- We've gotta get you out of here! You'll figure it out. You still have your money. You know what? True. Don't have that dude's baby. True. I-I just... I refuse to hurt his feelings, though, okay? He's just a person. Just a person. Yeah. Okay. Let's leave discreetly. I know a way. Okay. We gotta go! We gotta go. I need some fucking cigarettes! Okay, yeah, that was-- that was pretty weird. You know, you really fucking saved me, Rosy. You did it. You didn't need me. You just had to... Yeah. You look amazing, by the way. Thanks! Yeah, it's a little more me, huh? Where you gonna go now? Hmm. I don't know. Definitely not a family. I have friends. Um... It's better to have friends, anyway. Can I-- can I stay with you tonight? Yeah! God, you know, you're really a fucking fairy godmother. Hey, how'd you meet him, by the way? Some fucking website. I don't-- I don't really want to talk about him. It was fun being bad with you, though, huh? Wait, hold on, aren't you supposed to be, like, at work? Yeah, and I'm, uh... I'm kind of on holiday. Cool. Well, wanna do something tonight? I was supposed to be someone who'll win, not to be... ugh! Victimized. You made me feel like a winner. Ah, so many people make you feel like a winner while victimizing you. You ever notice that? Rosy, you know, they just fucking use you. Fuck you like this. You know? But I'm still fucking me, baby! Pfft! We should get an Uber. Because I'm not a hostage. I can call a fucking Uber myself! Can I use your phone? - Nola? - Huh? I think I've, like... taken a hostage. My friend, Helen. If she found out about the deal with... me... us. You know, you're allowed to fuck up with family. Maybe-- maybe this friend is that for you. Hey, Rosy. You're-- you're doing great! You know? Hey, you didn't get taken by a crazy guy! Yeah, but I'm the crazy guy, Nola. Helen's not my family, anyway. I can't make her that. I'm sorry. I do kind of have a mom now, though. Really? I don't know. Yeah, I think so. That's awesome. That's-- that's cool. Is that, um, Jane? Yeah, why? Um, she called you twice. What?! Oh, see, can you just-- that's our Uber. Come on and... Are you coming? Honey, come in! It's unlocked. -Hi. -Hi. Fucking life, eh? Are you drunk? Oh-- mmm. Darling... -Am I getting fatter? -No! You're a liar. You're lying to me. Where were you all week? Here! What are you talking about? You didn't call me. Oh, yes, you called. I forgot. I'm sorry. And I emailed. Mmm... This gift. The blanket. I appreciate it. Um, I just can't find anywhere for it, and I'm gonna be downsizing, moving somewhere smaller, so... you can take it back. Um, sure. You will find it a better home I'm sure. Are you breaking up with me or something? What? No! I do not operate that way. But you have called a lot this week. I thought you said you didn't get my calls. -I didn't say that. -So you were ignoring me? -What? -Why are you drunk? Ah-ha, asking about me! I do ask about you usually. What are you talking about? -Do you hate me? -Mm! What? I'm getting more. The calls were too much? Can you just answer the question?! It's not about the calls! -You think I'm pathetic? -Oh, my God. You do! I think you are... self-pitying. I know! But you're meant to take care of me. -Says who? -The Internet! The thing you signed up for on the Internet! Moms aren't meant to get day-drunk! Oh, hmph! You really don't want the blanket? I just don't have anywhere to put it! It's just gonna end up in a box! Did you make it for me? Or for you to give to me? Those two things are the same thing! I did not know what I was getting myself into. What the fuck?! What? My daughter sucks. She's pregnant! And I had to find out from somebody else, and I pretended that I already knew! Okay. What? That's horrible and I'm sorry, but... What? You said you didn't know what you were getting into with me. -I didn't! -So fucking say that to me! Don't tell me what I can and cannot say to you! Why not? It's not like you're my mom! You fucking ignore my calls, you say it's too much. It is too much! Well, I guess that's my answer, then. I was too much for all my foster families, too. I'm too much, I'm fucked, and that's why no one has ever wanted me! It's too much because I have my own life! Yeah. I get it. It really is awful about your kid and... Yeah, I have to go. Why? You don't care. You were meant to-- You were supposed to-- You made me need you and... argh! You've given me nothing! I gave you a lot! Yeah, but you've given me something and not everything, so actually it's worse than giving me nothing. I am a person, Rosy. Hey. I care. And I can be here in a way. But I am just a fucking person. Yeah, I know. I'm a person, too. Yeah, you are. I am. Yup.

Okay. Rosy, by the way. David. What is that? Oh, it's a knit blanket. It's yours? -Yeah. -Hmm! You want coffee? -Yes, please. -Mm-hm. -Noroc! -Thank you! Oh! Look at you! Two in a row! Hello? Hey, Helen, it's Rosy. Uh, listen, I'm really sorry about the other day. Showing up at your work like that. I know that you worked hard for that job, and... Yeah, I'm sorry. Hey, that's okay, Rosy. Um, listen, I'm actually on the other line with my mom. -Can I call you back? -Yeah, totally. Listen to that affirmation meditation if you haven't yet. Okay? I gotta go, though. Okay, bye.
