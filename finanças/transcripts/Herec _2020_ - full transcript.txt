Karel, Peter, Pavel and Josef entered the room. Every one of them had different shirt, Black, blue, white and green. What do we know? First who entered was Peter who didn't have white shirt Man in blue came after Karel. Pavel did not have green shirt. And finally... Man in green came last. Now we are going to verify the veracity of the statements: Karel came third. True or false? Don't do this to me. Karel enterd third Yes or no? Honza? Zlatohlavek? How about you mister plumber? Me? Yes, you. Do you know the answer? No. No. So no one. I mean it that he didn't come third. Karel came second. Statement is flase. Second statement: Petr has a black shirt. Yes or no? Yes, he came first, so he has black shirt. Third: We are not able to tell color of Pavel's shirt. False, he has blue shirt. Last one: Josef came last. Yes, that's correct. Comrade plumber. Thank you. I came here again Stanicka. Your Anezka is ready to get married. But still single. No wonders, when she works amongs all these louts. And Standa started to do maths, could you belevie that? I don't understand him anymore He's got his own world. Own problems. And soon, for sure, he is going to have own children. I miss you. I miss you so much Stanicka. What have I done? That I outlived my own child. Hi! Do you know where grandma is? Why? Did she go somewhere? I don't know. I just came from work and she haven't been here. Maybe she went to cemetry. It's closed by now. Maybe she is chatting with Ruzickova in a shop. I will check. Comrade Lanik? Stanislav, sincere condolences. How do you know that? Dean was signing your funeral leave. I know it's not going to be a solice, but I spoke with dean about you. About what? We won't discuss it here. Come with me. Please. To your grandma. Better? Please, sit down. May I? Of course. You were saying that... Shh Dean and I have agreed that if you pass balancing test You can start to study from next semester. For real? Yes, but be careful. There is a lot to catch up. Don't worry I can do it. I am not worried. You have it in you. No, I have you. I would be lost without that book. Seriously. How can I repay you? Don't bother. Maybe I could fix something for you home? There would be one thing. If you could come for a breakfast to me. To your place? Yes, this is not good place to talk, when is so cold in here.

Do you want to stay in theatre? What? Anezka told me, you are doing math now. That you are solving equations before bed. Well I try. It looks like you can have career in math even without politics. They don't have enough personnel... So they keep you even if you are a class enemy. Neverming, I go to sleep. I have something tomorrow. Standa... Do you mind if stay over night? Of course not. I am happy for you, just don't wake up the whole building. What happened? Nothing. I am going to sleep. Good night. Good night. Hello. Hello. Come in, Stanislav. Please change your shoes. Thank you. It so spacious. You know, comrades are bit nervous from Imperialistic atomic development, so they favour us, mathematicians. Give me a second. Who is he? Nobody anymore. Friend of mine. We knew each other... ..almost whole life. Knew? He... No, no. He just moved away. To Slovakia. Somewhere near Kosice. Please take a seat. Do you still see each other? Just mail. It's not the same. Human intimacy, can't be achieved by a letter. You stiull didn't tell me when should I expect balance test. Sugar? Only one. Thank you. test... Monday after next. I thought in february or march. I won't be able to chatch up. You will. I didn't even touch combinatorics... I said, it will be alright. We will cover that in summer. Right now, you just need to learn thnigs from the test. How would I find out what things? From me. Don't panic, Standa Yes, it's going to be hard test, but I will explain it to you. Maybe we could have a study weekend, on my cottage. No one will disturbe us there. What do you think? Great. Now we are friends in private. Yes. Viktor. Standa. And it's going to be cold in my office... Because you will.. you will be a respectable studen. And you won't be fixing heating. Who would say that? Já přišel vytrestat Vojnarku, A já sic už to není ta tenká Madlena, ale selka statných boků. Selka, na pěkném statku, Pane, to by byla avanž! What happened? Where's everyone? Antonin will be played by someone else. How come? Who? Petr Hrdlicka. Him? He is average at best and Eva said... I know what she said. However our theatre falls under the Union of Youth for a year now. When I introduced them... the cast, Jirka Dvorak unfortunately, remebers you well. Who? Listen to me Lanik, if you have to get drunk on New Years eve, at least be cautious enough to not talk about your parents. Oh, This one! I am so pissed! Whole theatre depends on you, and you screw it like this! And you want to make it better casting Hrdlicka? He has lisp! Yes he has. But the Union cares less about that! They will not care about me neither. I will fix this, you will see. How? Dvorak will come to me and appolgize. Please wait one week. Cast is no longer to discuss. I was so happy that we can play something less stupid then Turner Karhan. I will not put this play in risk because of you. You really mean this? You didn't hear me? You know what? I am done with you! Standa! And don't forget tell Hrdlicka to learn all that shit, I was good for. Standa, wait. Standa! He just told me today, I will try to change his mind. I will not beg him! Good bye! Panáka.

Don't talk about my mum. Isn't that reason, why she was arrested? What are you doing bitch? Do you want to know, what happened to my mum? Father disappeared, and she stayed faithful. It wasn't her fault that some captain of Wehrmacht has courted her and was bringing her fucking oranges! She has never had anything with Fritz! Never!

Oh no no, thank you. I had enough, Alright, but last one. Stanislav, we live in peculiar times, Committees for everything. Behind every door informer. Only mathematics... ...is apolitical. Pure. Beautiful. It will keep us safe. Us, men, who like same things. We can... make our world better. We won't let anyone in. It will be only for us! Mine and yours. But if you don't want to... That stain is bigger and bigger. I appologize. When I'll finish here I come to you. But there is a waterfall from my ceiling. I know, but what do you expect me to do? It soaking wet so it drips. I told you I come to you when I finish here. So you are going to polish it here and I can sit there in a rain. I have to dry it here, otherwise it will soak more. Where should I live meanwhile? Go to hell, I don't care! Let me finish it here. Oh my God! You went too far, whore. I am going to sue you. Sue me Douchebag! You want me to go to hell? You will go to hell!
