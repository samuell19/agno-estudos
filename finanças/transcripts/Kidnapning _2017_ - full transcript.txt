Do you know it when you just wish you were somewhere else? How do I feel right now. For a little while is the the corner, and it's over with us. It is here, it's me. My name is Anders. It is my older brother, Oskar. Far out and world champion in hernia. Then there's my sister, Winnie. Gender girl ... But make no mistake. She beats a stable paralyzes. The ugly runt is Bertram. A bill wandering chaos. Cold as a chest freezer and stupid than the police allow. And how could it go so wrong? That's a good question. It all started the day my father was released. Mom had just gotten free. As the father smoke in jail, she had to take several night shifts. Yet I have never heard her complain. - Good morning darling. - Good morning. Now I have. Reach. Thanks. - Well, then I will go to, darling. - Yes. - Ses afternoon. - Yes. - Good morning, Winnie. - Good morning. - What's up, sister pie? - Shh! - Mother sleeping. What are you thinking? - I'm trying to create a little bold mood. Good morning, assholes! - Mom can not sleep in the noise. - It's not noise. It's heavy. - Is there more? - I can damn not live by. - So. - Why should he have it all? - Because he's the smallest. - Thank you, Winnie. Typical! No low blows. And only with a flat hand. - Is Donald in place? - Why do you ask him yourself? Winni banks Oskar again! Come, there is a fight! Hurry up, everybody. Come on! Oskar gets ass. Heja, guilty, heja, guilty, heja, guilty, heja, Guilty! It'll do. Just go to fight the battle. Heja, Guilty! Speed, Bertram. And remember: only fruit, no lunches. - I mean it. - Yes, yes, relax. - Why rooting always on Winni? - It's more fun to see you get beaten up. Heja, guilty, heja, Guilty! Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty! Guilty, guilty, guilty! - So stop in! - Okay. - Give signs before you hit me. - It should be a surprise. - Otherwise see it's not real. - It feels nice genuine. - Hey, the red lunchbox is mine. - I knew it. You liar. - We only go after the fruit. - Give me laying on chocolate. - What's going on here, what? - Slip. It is a closed party. - I'm disappointed in you, Winnie. - I should have known better. - Yes exactly. - It was Theo's fault. If he had not gossiped, had not figured it out. Stop. I lubricates not packed lunches, that ye steal other people's fruit. - The bread is moldy, mom. - Nonsense. It broke nothing wrong. I understand it may be tempting to see what the other kids have ... Therefore, I do not ... - Are you okay, Mom? - Yes Yes. Yes i am fine. We will not focus on it, we do not have, right? Come then. - Otherwise we'll be late. - Yes, yes. My dad is not a criminal. His crime is - - He would do anything for his family. When Uncle George asked if he would sail a boat from Poland to Denmark - - he said of course yes. George had not told that the boat was filled with illegal cigarettes. – Far! – Hey! Far! I've missed you. Fuck it. Hey. Hey darling. - Should we get home? - Should we get home? - Then there's pizza. - We spent the entire week's food budget now. It should probably go. You should release more so we could get pizza. - It seems you, your mess. - Calm down. Forget it, Mom. With a blow was too full, as before father smoke in the damper. For a moment it seemed as if we were an ordinary family. For a brief moment. - Who comes next? - Have no idea. - It is probably Georg, who will say hello. - Georg! - You look like shit when not Uncle Georg. - Do you have your father or mother at home? Far! Good evening. I come from Copenhagen enforcement law. There has not been paid rent for eight months. - You must leave the apartment. - Will we be thrown out? - No, this is a misunderstanding. - No. - What happens? - They'll throw us out. You paid rent, right? - Treasure? - Mother? - Are you okay, honey? - Yes. Yes, I've completely mastered it. - Do not worry ... - Baby? They said she had gone down with stress. It grasped Bertram of course not. She went damn nowhere. She wishy-washy on in the hallway. That said, he is not as mercury. We were allowed to stay in the apartment overnight. Next morning it was the turn of the guard. And then there was only one place we could go. Did you also know an uncle? If not, then you have good few minutes. He also had been up early that morning. And it does not look like Uncle Georg. Unless there's money in it. Then Georg prepared to do anything. Well, let's see. Where are you? Dr Death approaching. Bernhard? Bernhard, there is breakfast. Bernhard? You have written your last prescription, Doctor. - Off! - The doctor is eliminated. Excellent shot, young Bernhard. And purple, that's just my color. - Want to enjoy the food elsewhere? - What about the South Pole? So, now something happens. Welcome, Bernhard. You must not start before I come ind. I would greet from your father. - Hooray for you. - Yes. And hurray for you. I can not see shit here. So, now they run. - Georg? - Shut up, it's the police! Bertram... There is no reason to scare him. - Georg? - He's gone underground. Georg? Are you down there? Oskar! Oskar! Oskar and Bertram, then stop! Come on, George, it's fucking cold! Georg, damn. - Had you forgotten we were coming? - What? Of course not. Come on in. Well, welcome to mi casa. - Here we can damn not stay, Dad. - Yes Yes. - Where to sleep? - Any suggestions, Georg? Yes! I thought actually that Winni ... ... you could get the east wing over here. Just... And then ... well, then I thought actually that ... ... the boys could get the west wing over here. One should just move it. What is this really? Hoof! The... It is a small art project that I work on. So it should not ... - Now do not bullshit, do you, George? - No no. There is pure ass to honk in you. Complete. Like that. Calm. You just feel at home. Is there any sleeping teddy bear in it here butts bulge? - Bertram, not what cabinet. - Wow. Is it marijuana? No, Bertram. The Polish cigarettes. Come here. The kids saw their mother go down with the flag and have been thrown out. - Police should not come running. - It happens damn either. Ah, the last time does not count. I did not know his brother was publican. - What do you think about me? - Georg! I have never in jail again. I am in. Well. Funny now. Hey, hey. Kiss me, and I applaud you one. What are you doing, clammy motherfucker? - There was no room in the west wing. - What happens? - He parasites themselves in my bed. - I do not sleep on the floor. The east wing is forbidden to scrounge rob. Scrounger. Do not you call me. - If you say that again, so ... - So what? You should eddermame not have done. Winni and Oskar, stop then. Now! - Go for Oskar. - Off! - Not ... - Then there's breakfast. - What the hell are you doing? - Perlemål! And! - Well! Attack! - Take George! Come here. It is something of a breakfast. Have you robbed a bank? I'm just trying to take care of my family. Then you have to dig deep. - You are a hero. - Yes, a little, right? - Should I go for a ride with the kids? - They must be in school. It could be that they needed a day off. They are thin-skinned. I'm damn not thin-skinned. It may be that it is not a bad idea. I'm trying to get some work. - Pøj, pøj with it. - Is it difficult? Everyone needs someone who can take hold. 100%. I've At least heard. What do you say? Then we visit the mother in the afternoon. - I'm fresh. - I do not say no. We will not go down with stress. Ever since I was a little kid, I dreamed of a big, nice house. With private garden and views and all. I have also always be full of - - an injustice sense why anyone should have so much ... Who do we rob? - What are you talking about? - Is not that why we're with? No. It's because I think it was inhuman, that I was through. Drop it and tell us what it is about. Is there no one trusts me anymore? Okay ... I have the wildest idea. What the hell is he doing? - Is he the old when his father? - No, it's the butler. - What is a butler? - A kind of servant. - Does he have a restaurant or what? - He takes care of the house and such. - The danger're traveling all the time. - Now it is my turn. - Who are we looking at? - The father is a bank manager. He has so much money that he does not know what he should do with them. - And? He gives hardly any of us. - Yes, if he wants to see his son again. So you're saying we should kidnap him bank director's son? Kidnap sounds so violently. We lend him just in a few days. Borrower him? Such a loan can provide up to ten years in jail. I need you. In charms him into believing it is a play arrangement. - What if he will not play? - Of course, he does it. I am sweet, funny and cool. Who will not play with you? You are not above the age of criminal responsibility, so I can not get in jail. - I can not get in jail? - Not if you're under the 15th Why has nobody told me? I've wasted eight years of my life. - How much will you take for him? - A million. - Would not you give it to Bertram? - Bertram is a few rolls biscuits worth. I'm worth gold. Winni I would like to give a few million to get rid of. Is there not a king's plan? - It is a serious crime. - And? We can not get in jail. - Not, but we can be forcibly removed. - Anders is right. - What says the father of the plan? - It's a pleasant surprise. - I doubt he will be pleased. - Do you have a better idea? - Yes. What about a normal job? - People like us never get a normal job. - He has no chance. - We rob a bank. - It's risky. - Chicken. Your father and I are Jutes. Jyder whining not. We are proud. We would rather suffer than ask for help. - Are you sure you are Jutlander? - He is the stone safely adopted. I did not fit. Okay, so you say, Dad would think - - it was okay, we detained a boy because he is proud? - Ish ... - The I do not buy. Okay. Bertram, try to come here. Just look at Bertram once. - Look at him. He looks like shit. - Speak for yourself. When did I last got new clothes from a store and not from a bag? New clothes, a dinner, a holiday. Your parents want to give it to you. - I've never been on holiday. - That is what I mean. - Mother and father kill us. - Therefore, it is a surprise. Your mother and father will be happy to get a good slate of dates on the account. - So what do you say to it, kids? - To what? - Why do not we visit the mother? - Jo. - Why are you so happy? - I say this on the road. - Georg, we must borrow the car? - Be my guest. You'll never catch me, Ironmask. One two Three... Your turn, Bertram. Bertram? Treasure! - When will you be home, Mom? - Soon, honey. - You do not look very sick. - What it is not. It's hard when you can not see, I'm sick outside. - Do you as evil In the stomach? - No, I did not hurt that way. - Why are you in the hospital? - I just need peace and quiet. - It is good that the mother will have a holiday. - It does not count as vacation. - So there must be a pool. - Turn now, Bertram. Beach Road, it's mine. Twenty kilos, Oskar. - Well, behave yourselves properly? - Yes, it runs for us. We plan to kidnap a rich kid and ask a million in ransom. It might look like you. - Tell what are you doing? - Dad to interview. - No, how cool. - It should be a surprise. - She also looks surprised. - Yes. - Can kids be here while? - I think when you should take them. You can not bring children with you. Who can say no to a single father with four poor, poor children? - Do you mean it? - All tricks apply, right? - assholes. - It would just not be. Back in the saddle. Do not think of me. I'll be fine. - You look like you can drink a beer. - Yes, you give? Bertram, dammit. - What do I owe you for the beer? - 4.75. - That's it, Dad. - Bertram ... - What are we to eat? - Jams Smadder. Do you have any money on you, George? The box is empty. I will just take a trip. - Where? - Down at the harbor. - Should we go with? - No, I just need fresh air. - What's the kid? - What a kid? - Yes, him rich. - Bernhard. Bernhard La Croix Eriksen from love. - Are you kidding? - No no. The name is buksevand in school. - Does he have any friends? - I never saw him with anyone. - So we make him actually a favor? - Yes, 100%. Let's tweak Bernhard von der something. By love.

Father had just gotten the job, we could have avoided all the trouble. For how crashes to a party at a castle and kidnap the guest of honor? According to Georg it's all about keeping a low profile. - A Görlitzer with it all. - Yes please. Thanks for sausage. Pardon. A Görlitzer with det hele. - You fill it all, Oskar. - Sorry. - Come In time, Bertram. - Forget it. - Bertram! - No, I told you. - What happens? - Bertram will not dressed up. - I would be Ironmask. - They did not have a Ironmask costume. - We need you to come dressed up. - Nope. - Take something on. - No, it was said.

Wow, Ironmask. So you have to be dressed. - I'm damn too dressed up. - Like what? - Kidnapper. - Who are you going to kidnap? Initially one ass cakes. Write to Winni, she found him. - I am leaving. - Can I have your number? - No. - Why not? - Because I'm wanted by the police. - Exciting.

The coolest idea, which is also this year's winner. - What do we do? - And the winner is... The kidnapper! - Come here, kidnap! - Did I win?

We will contact you with information about the delivery. - Father is coming! - And no police and no press! - What do we do? - What do we do with Bernhard? - Into the closet with him. - I will not go in there! It is a cupboard! Now, you go in the closet. Otherwise, you get decapitated down at the knees! - And not a peep in here! - Should we not charm him? You must excuse me, I shouted for you. I was stressed and lost his head. I'm glad we got the talk! - Hey, kids. - Hi. Guess what I have. - I've got a job! - Cool, Dad. - Super great. - Great, Dad. - Is that all I have to say? - You are a clever boy. Stop it. I tell you a great news, and then you stand just there.

No more breakfast spoiled and ungrateful snot puppies. A small call to the police and the press - - and my path will be totally clean. So the time has come that I will be master in his own house. Did you hear that? Men In own house. So is there a clear path! - It suits you. - Thanks. Now you have a snot young like us. Unger, now we just stay focused. Mikkelsen, leave a message. Yes, hello. It is the kidnapper. I'll call again later. Goodbye. - Were there answers? - Yes. Now I read it aloud to you, Kristian. "We have your son. Pay ten million kroner - - if you want to see him again. " - That is not correct! - Unfortunately, it is absolutely right and true. I not forgive myself for this. - No, not me. - Have you contacted the police? Of course. And they suggest - - that we agree to the handover of Bernard's safety. Okay, of course. - When will the handover take place? - Tonight. - I can not be home tonight! - Calm down, Kristian. I'll arrange it all. Count on it. Well. I do not know what I would do without you. Kristian. How to not think. But it also means that I will have full access to the money. I transfer the money.

I miss a little my mother. Try to hear. Kids. I just want to say to you: I have made it fucking well. I'm proud of you. - We are also proud of you. - Thank you, Anders. - Also by Bernhard. - Especially! You have been a good kidnapped. So. - It is important to praise each other. - You fucking klamphugger. - Should not you be at work? - It's hard when you read newspaper. - Do not believe everything you read. - I warned you! I warned you! You have destroyed my family! Are you aware of it? Your damn dog's head! - Your bonderøv! - Easy easy! Unger, what do you think of? How could I find it? Would you like in prison? Would you like to try, how sad, painful and lonely it is? We're not old enough. There are places such some criminals snot kids as you can reach. You know what the first thing that happens is? What? Mother and I are declared unfit as a parent, and you will be forcibly removed. It does not happen it here. It simply does not happen. - We would really just help you, father. - I've only made it worse. - Do not be mad at the kids. - You do not say what to do. - You just have to make amends. - How? It's a push, but do you think we can pretend this never happened? Maybe. If we say that we do not want any ransom ... - Do you think your father would agree to it? - I'm just saying it was a play arrangement. I am bringing the word, kids. Did you hear that, Bertram? Good evening! - Are you ready, Bernard? - Yes. - Is my dad there? - No, he has not landed yet. Well, then I slip. - See you. - Yes. seen. - Off you go. - Hi. I would like to be allowed to complain at the deepest. Well good luck with that. It was really something, huh strange something to say. This is the police! Hands over your head! - Race! - Come on, run! Stand still! Stay where you are! Mikkelsen, what happens? No, it was not meant! - It's best that way. - No! No! It was not a kidnapping. It was a play arrangement. Stop, Mikkelsen! Stop! - Where's Dad? - Is he not? No. Come now. Faster, Bertram. - Come on! - Yes Yes. Relax! He ran that way! So we are back where we started. As at the end. For the first time, I can not tell what's going to happen. For I know it not. Bertram. Come on. - City Taxi, good evening. - Yes, Mikkelsen here. I would like to order a cart as soon as possible. Far. - Sheep! - Yes hello. It should probably go. Now you see here. It only takes a moment. You just stand right here. They can not see you, and they can not hear you. Now you just take your time, right? So I ask all of you to ask yourselves over to the wall and look straight ahead. It's not them. - What? - Bernhard, are you absolutely sure? Yes! It's my best friend, Bertram and his family. Bernhard, just try to look again. - You're out of it. - You know nothing! You're never home. - The tone, I will not find myself I. - Why have not demanded ransom? They have! I paid ten million as we have not found. Ten million? I have been cheated. Bernhard. I think that is not. - Yes, Mikkelsen has taken the money. - Now stop, Bernhard! - Who is Mikkelsen? - It's my father's butler. Butler? You think it was the butler? Yes. This has been the easiest thing for him to blame them. - He's worked for me for 20 years. - why do you trust him? - That's right, yes. - More than you trust me? - They are thus identified. - Received. No, Daddy! Michael and Georg Jacobsen, I must ask you to follow. What should we? - You just wait here. - Do not be afraid. Somebody's coming and takes care of you in a minute. - It's so fucking typical! - What is typical? That this is happening to us! Everything always end up in shit for us. - Give me a flat, Winni. - What am I? Give me a flat! It was Anders, you would hit! Fight! Fight! Hey! Hello, Mikkelsen. I wonder where you are. Can you just call me? - Dad, why will not you listen to me? - Because it's fantasies that. - They arrive safely in orphanages. - Yes, I hope so too. - The father was unfit as a parent. - Bertram's father is a better father than you. You do not know what you're talking about. - He's at home, and you are always away. - Dad has a job. - But do father constantly work? - Yes. There's only me. We're not missing anything. - Mikkelsen! - We have so much money. - You never have to work more. - Now I do not want to talk more with you. Mikkelsen! Man. Treasure. I ... I'm just sorry that this has happened and I ... Where you are just a bummer! And. You're in shock, huh? This is how you do when you are in shock. Then say so. Lie down and slept. Does not? Well. Yes... Mikkelsen! Where filan are you her? Do not ask me how - - but somehow he had managed to sneak in the car. Yes, what can I say. Sometimes surpasses really just imagination. Wow! Let's head to him! Finder Mikkelsen. Welcome, Bernhard. - Can you well even drive a car? - No, it runs by itself. Autopilot enabled. Destination: Hotel Copenhagen Airport. - Do not have any music? - Of course. - Can you see which floor he live on? - No. But I know his suitcase. Boy, was I frightened boys. - Is not it a little late to rattle? - We are here with our grandfather. Yes, we were allowed to play a little, but now we can not remember where we live. - Is he the old snob? - Yes. - He's not in your room. - Where is he then? Finally. Finally lord in his own house. Now, so do you! By, for Satan then! - Bloody brats. - Surrender. Never in my life! - Shoot the bastard! - Bernhard! Call the police. No more, guys, thanks. Not anymore. - Where are we, darling? - The guess you never know. One, two, three, now! Surprise! What happens here? The game, right? - Hello Hello. - Hi. - I am Christian. Bernard's father. - Julie, snot kids' mother. Grab a drink. Just take for you the goods. - Yes go ahead. Just sit down. - Thanks. There are pillows. If you want a swim, then doing just that. Fantastic! It's nothing compared to what I've gotten out of it. No, it's fun. You make a plan, and then ... Well, then everything goes wrong. And. - I hear that you are missing an opportunity. - Yes. Yes that... - That is not very good. - It will be OK. If you hear of anything, do tell. I have a caretaker apartment out in Vanløse, if it is. - It's something ... Yes, you have to take hold. - It is no problem. - So is it yours. - Cool! - Cheers on it. - Cheers. It made I simply can not! I will come after you, I will! Not! Do you know it when you know you are in the right place at the right time? How do I feel right now. And this family is just to enjoy it as long as it lasts. Hey, Donald? Who says crime does not pay? Your little psychopath. - What the hell happened to Georg? - He'll get some delicious coffee. Hey! Stop the thief!
