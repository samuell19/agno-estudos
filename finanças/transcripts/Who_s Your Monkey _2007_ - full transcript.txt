What else you got in that basket? Hey, no, come on. I got the fruit. I got some of that cheese that you like. I already started on a little bit of it. Oh, man. What? I forgot the crackers. Mmm. Damn it. How are we supposed to eat the cheese without the crackers? What's wrong? Nothing. You know i wouldn't move without you. What? I knew you overheard me talking to my mom. And i was just mentioning to her that you and i talked about new york, sort of. She just said that she'd help us with the move. How did we just go" we were just talking about crackers, and now we're talking about new york and your mom and money? Well, how come every time i bring it up okay, you want to talk about it? Let's talk about it. We-- new york. It's, uh-- i think it's a great city. And, uh, it's just you're so beautiful and amazing. And i think you should move there, you know. We, we should. I can't even remember to bring crackers to a picnic. You want some wine? [Laughs] let's have some wine. The guy at the store said it was a good one, you know, for the price. Do you have a corkscrew? Huh? Oh, jeez. [Laughs] i can't believe this. You're really cute. I'm cuter after a couple glasses of wine. [Laughs] hey. Hey. What's up? Nothing. Just picking up some things. I got to clean my place for this fucking open house. Looks like these people might be interested, so... what? You can't sell your house. You love that place. What are you talking about? You and hutto spent months fixing that place up. Yeah, well, you got to do what you got to do, you know? It's not like people are dying to live in jacksonville. How you doing? You all right? Yeah, i'm okay. (Man) sir, i can't sell you that much cold medicine. State man date. But it's pseudoephedrine. It's a decongestant. Jesus christ. Okay? Look. Okay? All right. This time. Thank you. [Electronic beeping] [humming] [twangy blues music] ii (good ol' country railroad) ♪ one more cup of coffee ♪ i before i go i i one more piece of pie i (bobby) i'm just saying i could. (Laith) why did i order pie? Ugh. I fucking hate this place. Shi i i y asshole fuck. That good, huh? I'd rather be eating raisins out of your boyfriend's lovely ass. Wouldn't we all? Saucy. What did you do? Nothing. You did something. It's not what i did. You gonna tell me she did something? It better be that she's standing up pissing, 'cause i'm not gonna listen. It's complicated. Yeah, i'm sure. Brother, i love you, but you make cereal complicated. All right. For the last week or two, rebecca and me haven't had sex. And it's not because she doesn't want to. Oh, shit, problem solved. You're an idiot. There's more to it than that. Not as far as i'm concerned. Dude. Dude, what? League you are, right? Yeah. That you went from pop warner straight to the nfl just 'cause you couldn't change her friggin' tire? Wait, who's pop warner? You shouldn't even be allowed to be in the same room with that woman, let alone her vagina. You should probably be on your knees every day thanking god for fucking up. Yeah, i know; i have eyes. I understand the situation. And not only is she incredibly hot, but she's smart, and she's funny, and she has style and taste, and she gets things. She has a palate that wasn't trained on pizza rolls and hot pockets. Do you want me to tell you what happened or not? Yes, yes, i'm done. I don't know, you're just gonna think i'm being stupid. Probably. You know, i was watchingdr. Phil the other day with rebecca. Dr. Phil? Yeah, that's right, dr. Phil. Anyway, it was this whole show about abusive relationships, and i got to tell you, man, it hit really close to home. You know what? Fuck dr. Phil. Fuck him and his bald head. If you're drunk and you're high on cocaine and your dumb ass runs over a little nun crossing the street, guess who's gonna help you dispose of the body? Bobby is, not dr. Phil, so what do you think dr. Phil would have to say about that, huh? I'm sorry. Sorry. You're right; phil sucks. Whatever. Just continue with your fascinating story. Okay, oh, so i'm in the shower, right, and i got, like, soap in my eyes-- (lisa) have you seen my-- god, this place is such a mess. Oh, found it. Hey, what are you watching? Wait, go back. Go back. Dr. Phil? I lovedr. Phil. No, you don't. Bullshit, i don't. And so i turn it on to see if it really is. Well, what it is, you know. (Woman) order up. Are you listening to me? Huh? Yeah, you were getting in the shower. Yeah? That's as far as i got. Are you serious? Don't whine like a little bitch. Just rewind a little bit. Seriously, what else do you have to do? So i'm in the shower, okay? Ow, god damn it. "Ow, god damn it." Well, shouldn't you be having a baby or something? Suck me, doughboy. Lynn let you out? Yeah, to pick up dinner. She is wearing me out. Did hutfo just call me fat? No, i believe he called you doughboy. Yeah. How's the wife? She's still big and angry. She got into an accident today. Lynn did? Is she okay? She's fine. Put her in a great mood, though. I'm not fatfer than hutfo is. Dude, you're fatfer than my wife, and she's 14 months pregnant. Yeah, hutto's right. Besides, he's a big guy. He looks exactly like he's supposed to, as does his wife. You really think i'm fat? Yes, i think you're fat. Your face didn't used to do this. [Laughter] not fat. That's my-- that's skin. That's skin right there, and everybody's got that. (Hutto) but seriously, you've been looking a little frumpy lately. Fruivipy? That's a good vvord for it, actually. No, wait a minute, no. I'm not gonna have fat jokes-- have some more pie; lt'll make you feel better. You want some whip cream on it? Can we get some whip cream? I don't want whipped cream. Screw you guys, seriously. I only got ten minutes left. For what? The meter. What meter? There's no meters. I'm on the street. Your truck's right there. Lynn gave you a time limit, didn't she? Idol's on tonight, and she likes to eat during the performances. Idol, "my name's hutfo, and i got to get home before mr. Ryan seacrest gets really mad at me." You know what? I will crush your gigantic head with my ass. Hey, if you two are gonna make out, i'm gonna leave, okay? Thank you. Gigantic? Would fall out already. Don't worry; it'll fall out eventually. It wasn't like this before. Inducing the pregnancy? A c-section? No, no, she doesn't want that. [Sighs] see, i tried to get mark to talk to her about it, but he won't even return a phone call. Yeah, he's too busy cooking crystal meth for reed. How do you go from saving lives to manufacturing meth? Hey, i thought you had a plan. You said you were gonna talk to him. I do. We're going over there later this evening. (Laith) no, we're not some. Anywhere. I'm not going there; last time i was at mark's place, he sucker punched me. Dude, you fell on his fist. Just shut up already. What's in the bag that's gonna help mark? Well, a few months ago, my mother found these. And that's gonna help mark? I told you it was a stupid idea. See, bobby thinks that by taking these over to marks, that it's gonna make him remember his childhood and care again. I mean, how stupid is that? Sometimes we have to get in touch with our inner child just to remember how truly innocent we are. Somebody's been watching dr. Phil. Dr. Phil, huh? Oh, yeah, you think that's funny, don't you? Even hutio thinks it's a stupid idea. I never said that. What do younot think is a bad idea? Not giving someone who's deeply depressed deadly weapons. Well, hold on, bobby might be onto something. Do you remember how much fun these were? No. Well, i remember how much it sucked laying in the emergency room in my ass. Oh, that's right. I'm still sorry about that. You didn't sit down for a week. Real funny. Good times. Shit, i got to go. I'm gonna keep this one. Knock yourself out. Fine, i'm keeping one too then. Oh, see, you saw how it made him feel: the same way that they make me feel, the same way they're gonna make mark feel. Whatever. Ithink hutfo ruined this shirt. Look, it's all stretched out now. Look, it's not my fault his wife is pissed off at him, you know? Hey, i feel for the guy, you know? I remember what it was like when my mom was pregnant with me. Women are tough as it is. You put another person inside of them for nine months... coming with me or not? Fine, yeah, i guess. Listen, if mark tries to punch me again, i swear to god-- what, are you gonna whine to me like a little bitch? You got this? What? Dude, all i had was a diet pepsi. And pie. Okay, look, i'll tell you what. I'll get this. You get the beer on the way. Or is that too absurd for you? (Rebecca) we'll talk later at home? Night. You know i don't smoke. Why are we walking again? When i lived in new york, we walked everywhere. Dude, you didn't live in new york. You were there for, like, two months. It was barely a vacation. It's because hutfo called you fat. I'm not fat. I'm sure you're not. Can i ask you a question if you promise not to think i'm an idiot? Yes and probably not. Who's reed? How is it that i've known you my entire life, yet sometimes you feel like an out-of-town cousin from baltimore? Reed is probably the most disgusting human being i've ever known in my life, man. He's a loser. [Tires screech] [pulsing techno music] ii he's cute, ain't he? Yeah. Oh, he likes you. [Dog barking and growling] you must have a lonely soul. He could sense that. Now, get him the fuck off your leg. I we got some work to do i i work to do i [goat bleating] come on, come on, ringo. Come on, bro. Tonight is your night to shine, brother. Come here. Come here. You are gonna rock it out tonight. You are gonna rock her fucking-- give me more. Huh? Give me more. Yes. [Laughs] mm-hmm. This is gonna be the one. I can feel it, you know? This is gonna be mygodfather. You know that it's so much more than just you fucking a couple of dogs. You know what i mean? You know? The scripts a thing of beauty. I swear. Look, baby, look, this movie's made for you, you know? I get points, right? Yeah, you get fucking points, yeah. Gross, not net. I don't want to fucking monopoly money. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You will; you will. I'm serious. I promise you. I promise. [Pounding at door] you're late. That dogus too small. Hey, wait a second. When did i tell you you can fucking talk to me? Did i tell you something like that? Until i tell you you can talk to me, you can't fucking talk to me! You understand? Okay. Go, go, go. [Horse neighs] get in there. Where's the fucking horse? It's on the set. Jenny ain't gonna like that dog. So if i wanted a zebra, he would get me a zebra? I guess. Well, no wonder hutto's pissed. That's disgusting. It's sick. You got to talk to mark. What, you're okay with mark cooking crystal, just not for a guy who uses his connection at the zoo to produce animal porn? And what's crystal? Crystal meth, jackass. It's an epidemic. Never heard of it. 90210. Who's the guy that was always on and off with donna? David. Yeah, remember the episode where he's with his little sister, and he lost her at the park 'cause he was doing crystal, and everyone freaked out? Dave was such a little bitch. Yeah, totally. That's reed's mini. He drives a mini? Yeah, i know, right? Oh, my god, you weren't kidding. I had a puppy just like that when i was a kid. Hi, puppy. [Dog whining] i can't leave. [Duck quacking] [goat bleating] i'm freeing the animals. Well, then i'm freeing one of these beers. I'm serious. Yeah, so am i. [Goat bleating] i'm coming for you, buddy; hang in there.

Harder, oh, oh. [Knocking at door] oh, baby, can you come? [Knocking at door] shit. Oh, oh. Mm, baby, come on. [Dog barking] what? What's up? Nothing. You know, i've had just about enough of the awkward silences with you lately. Okay. [Dog barking] he's all fired up. Kiwi? Nope, strawberries and cream. Where's your towel? I don't know. I forgot. You can always use a sock. What happened to your hand? What? Nothing. What happened to you? Fuck this. You better talk to him. [G09 barks] elly, nice to see you, as always. Is this because he thinks i punched him? I didn't mean it. He fell into my fist. I know. [Door slams] i thought your dad threw th ese away. Yeah, it turns out he wasn't such a bad guy after all. So can we talk? About reed? Yeah. No. Listen, man-- i don't vvant to talk about it. You're gonna get yourself-- dude, you don't understand. I'm totally fucked right now. Forget the fact that i lost my entire career. I am broke, bobby. My student loans, the lawyers, you have no clue. Oh, i have no clue? What? What? Lisa died. I get it already. Okay, my problems can't compare. That's why it's okay for you to act like a goddamn child. Congratulations, bobby. You're the big winner in the "worst thing that can happen to you in your life" contest, huh? I quit giving a shit. It's been almost two years. I suggest that you do the same. Maybe then you won't have to be so fucking numb all the time. That seems like a pretty idiotic way to life your life. You know, maybe you should start giving a shit. Because one day in one second, you're gonna wish you did. You finished? Yes, i'm finished. You can enjoy your fast food and porn. [Door slams] what a dick. Hey, at least he seemed to like the stars. Whatever. So what are you gonna do now? I don't know, at monty's. Nightcap? It's like 8:30. At night. Be there? Who? You know who. Oh, oh, i don't know. Gonna not talk to her again? [Laughs] bite me. You gonna not ask her her name, or maybe not buy her a drink again? Yeah, i get it. You're the funny guy. (Reed) motherfucker. What did you say? I didn't say anything. [Laughing] well, at least you're wearing shorts. You know, this isn't a dorm. You can't just-- oh, is someone not getting any lately? Here. Here's a visual for ya. Now, why don't you go jerk off or something? Maybe you'll become less of an asshole. [Sighs] [pounding on door] [dog barking] oh, hi. [Laughs] what do you want? What do i want? What do you think i want, bro? Well, i told you tomorrow. I told you, "that's too fucking bad." I need my drugs tonight, bro. You don't have any fucking idea how hard it is to get a 95-pound white girl to suck a horses dick without her drugs? Hmm? You pay well, and i need the money, but i can't do this anymore. That is so funny that you said that, 'cause i was, like, totally expecting you to say something like that, totally. I mean, it has been one fuck of a night. This just--this isn't me. I--i-- i know it's not you. It's just not you. I know. Oh, you know who ron garvin is, bro? Who? You know who that is? [Energetic country music] ii this doesn't change anything, man. I don't have your shit! [Crashing] how about that? Didn't change anything. [Cracking] want another beer, bobby? Oh, i suppose.

(Bobby) bobby, it's hutfo. Hey, hutfo, what's up? Something big happened at mark's house. He needs us there right now. Just meet me at mark's house, okay? I can't believe this. You're gonna go out and do god knows what with them? Would you keep your voice down? Don't tell me how to talk in my own home. I have to do this, lynn. You have to or you want to? What? Now, why don't you just admit it? Whatever this is, it's fun for you. I got to go. Hey, you don't think that this scares me too? What does that have to do with anything? Everything. You're unhappy, james. I'm pregnant. Look, i don't have time for this. No, because one of your dumbass friends has screwed up again, and it's hutfo to the rescue. I really wish that i was one of your boys, 'cause then maybe you'd act like you love me too. That's just the pregnancy talking. No, jam es. What? It's the pregnant wife who doesn't want to see her husband get hurt or in prison. Whether you like it or not, you have a family. Those guys are my family too. What do you want me to do? [Door slams] shit. Can't you tell him no? No, if he says i have to, then i have to. Why? That makes absolutely no sense. You don't know hut-to. It's obviously a big deal. Why is it a big deal? Because he said so. You are so frustrating. You and your friends are weird. Why? Do you know how many friends i still have from high school? Two, and we only talk online. How do you open this thing? It's because it's different. You're not from around here. No, it's not. I talk to people at work who are from jacksonville, and they pretty much agree with me. You guys are freaks. Who do you talk to at work? It's not just that you're all still friends. It's like you can't poo without the other person to okay the wipe. Um, yeah. What's that noise? [Buzzing stops] what noise? Nothing. I just thought i heard something. What are you doing? Nothing. You're beautiful. Yeah? Then why are you in such a hurry to leave? [Phone rings] wait, wait. (Hutto) i_aith. I'm here. Are you outside? Yes, come on. Okay, i'll be right out. Novv. I'll be right out. I can't believe you're actually going. Lately, you'll do anything not to touch me. What? That's stupid. Really? 'Cause i've been practically naked for the past two hours, and you haven't even laid a hand on me. We haven't had sex in over two weeks. What the hell is going on? Is it me? [Horn honks] i got to go. I gotta. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This better be good. Rebeccns really pissed. You know that guy reed? No, not really. But you know who he is. Well, i've heard of him. I've never met him, and i don't know what kind of car he drives. Who cares about his car? I'm just saying that i don't know what kind-- shut up. He's dead. Really? His body's over at marks house. What? Mark killed him. Now, this is serious shit. I need you to be somewhat in control tonight. Let me out; seriously, let me out. Seriously, let me out, hutfo. Son of a bitch. Oh, ow. [Groaning] yeah, that's pretty much of being in control. You alive? Why did i do that? You are some kind of moron, you know know that? You want to go back home? Fine, but before you do that, ask yourself how many times has one of us saved your ass? I never needed help with murder. All right, do you know what happens to guys like me in jail? I don't like the taste of my girlfrienus ass. You know what? Bobby was right. When it comes right down to it, you're just a selfish pussy. Bobby said that? We all say it. What? It's true. One, two, three. I'm not selfish. Jesus christ. You sneaky prick. Fine, but say it. What? I'm not selfish. Fine, i'm not selfish. Or fat. Get in the truck, you chubby little bastard. [Pulsing techno music] ii [bluesy country music] (man) i of this thing i will tell i i i will tell i [bright guitar music] ii holy shit. Hey, jackass, put those on; you too. I want gloves on at all times. Where's bobby? (Hutto) he should have been here already. Holy shit. Laith? Please don't play with the body. Dude, i eat with that; come on. You killed him with a throwing star. Why aren't we calling the cops? Is that crystal? Really? Laith? Trust me, i thought about it, all right? There aren't too many people you can call to help move a body. Holy shit. Laith, find his keys. His keys? Yeah, his car keys, find thel\/i. Where? I don't know, how about his fucking pockets? Laith, gloves. Vvhat th e fuck? What? "Vvhat?" This dead guy; what happened? You know, if i tell you now, i'm just gonna have to retell it to bobby, and honestly, i don't feel like telling it twice. Oh, honestly, i don't feel like moving a body tonight. Let's go. He put a gun in my mouth and pulled the trigger, but the gun jammed. Oh, jesus, you lucky bastard. Yeah, i don't even know what set him off. He was pissed that i didn't have his drugs, so he was gonna take elly. And then all of a sudden he went ballistic, telling about his car and animals, something about a monkey. A monkey? Yes, a fucking monkey. So? I didn't know what he was talking about. He went crazy. Next thing i know, i'm shoving a throwing star through his head. I told bobby those thbowing stars were a bad idea. Hey, that th rowing star saved my life. You say tomato, i say tomato. I think you've done enough. How did you manage to shove it that deep in his skull? At first he didn't die, so he went out to his car to get another gun. With that thing in his head? Yeah. Really? I know. It was fucking crazy. When he came back in the house, i hit him in the side of the head with the skillet. Was it the one i got you for christmas? Yeah, i thought it was a strange gift at the time. Are you seasoning it like i told you to? With crisco, yeah. Where you been? You live, like, two blocks away. Thank you, captain geography. His keys aren't in his pockets. Holy shit. That's what i said. (Hutto) here, bobby, put these on. He went out to his car. (Laith) yeah. So go look out there. Hey, why am i the only one doing anything? Because you need the most exercise. Great, more fat jokes. Fine, that's exactly what we need right now. [Laughs] shit. Well, he's definitely dead. Is something funny? If i say yes, are you gonna kill me too? Fuck off. What happened? See, huh? Now i got to retell it. Like living it wasn't bad enough. Look, honestly, i really don't even care. What's the plan? We're gonna lose reed's mini, bury his body. Well, unless, of course, you got a better idea. No, no, not really. Bobby, do you think possibly you could be sober tonight? Come on, go outside, please, and help laith find the keys. Try not to fall on the way out. Mark, put your goddamn gloves on. (Bobby) no luck? This is fucked up. That crazy redneck put a gun in marks mouth and pulled the trigger, but the gun jammed. [Laughs] lucky fucker. Yeah. And imagine what he would have done to you if he caught you smashing his-- it's 'cause of you. No, no, no. The th rowing star. Shh, keep your voice down. He thought it was mark. Jesus, laith. Does mark know? No. Look, can we just keep this between ourselves for now? Yeah, i can. But i bet you 50 bucks you can't. But you're not gonna say anything, right? No, but you will. [Quiet scratching] shh, you hear that? What? I thought i heard something. I cannot believe that guy came all the way out here with the throwing star in his skull. Hey, dr. Dipshit. Keys were in the door. That's so weird. He used the actual key and not the keyless remote to open the door. Yeah, that's it. That's what's weird. How you feeling? Like i just had the shit beat out of me. It's a good thing you're a doctor. Yeah. I'm surprised you still have that thing. It's good. [Quiet scratching] do you hear that? The scratching sound? Yeah. No. Then how'd you know it was a scratching sound? I heard it earlier. Oh, so you heard it. Yeah, earlier. Hey, did you notice how drunk and dirty bobby was? What's new? No, i mean his clothes were actually dirty. I didn't notice. A couple of months ago, lynn was feeling extra hormonal. She wanted to visit lisa's grave. It was like 3:00 in the morning or something ridiculous, and i wasn't in the mood to argue. Not that that would have ivia-l-febed. And vve find bobby passed out in front of her tombstone. Really? Yeah. That's fucked up. That's it? It's creepy. He was passed out-- you're damn right it's creepy. I think it's something you should concern yourself with. I mean, how long have you known him? Since i was five, same as you. Now, how are you gonna let someone you've known since kindergarten sleep in a fucking cemetery? I just found out. And whose fault is that? Somethingus coming from under the car or under your chair or your seat or something. I don't know; who cares? Dude, what is up your ass? We got in another fight tonight. What? Hmm? Who? Who do you think? Me and rebecca, 'cause i'm not having sex with her. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you got to finish telling me that story. Actually? I don't give a shit. Really, 'cause unless it has something to do with her trying to stick her penis in you, you got no excuse. You and i both know neither of those two dipwads would have made it this far without you. Bobby would be dead by now. Mark, you need to get your shit together. Friends don't let other friends sleep on graves. Maybe you should just listen to me-- hold on, hold on, hold on. There it is again. What is that? Dude, it's nothing. What about me? Medicine was my life. What about how i'm doing? You've got a body in your trunk. I'm pretty up to speed on how you're doing. It's back here. Oh, shit! Behind your chair! Oh, shit! What the fuck is that? What the fuck are they doing? [Screaming] that's not helping! I'm gonna try to stop it! [Screaming] get it out of here! Get it out of here! [Crashing] (bobby) oh, shit. That did not just happen. What the hell is this? The hell is this? Are you okay? (Laith) you--no-- what the hell happened? Get me out of here. The what? Come on. Look, let's all get in the car. What are you two morons doing? Uh, we've got a problem. Is bobby hurt? No, but there's something on his leg. I think it's a monkey. What? A monkey. Ew, ew, ew. (Hutto) get it off. I tried to get it off. Get off me, monkey. Get off. Pull on it. You pull on it. Jesus christ. [Squeaking] [screeches] i told you; i told you! I told you. Hold still. Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? What does it look like i'm doing? No fucking way. (Laith) i thought vve vvere leaving. The monkey won't let go of bobby's leg. (Laith) well, try prying it off. Pry it off, pry it off. Be careful, come on. [Screaming and screeching] [groaning] all right, bring the monkey. Seriously? Are you serious? (Hutto) yeah, i'm not gonna cut off his leg. I'm not getting in the car with that monkey. Get in the car, laith. No. Fine, stay here. [Tires squealing] wait, wait, wait. Can i take my gloves off now? (Hutto) those gloves are the only reason over reed's mini right now. My hands feel all weird. Your hands feel weird? When you were looking for the keys, how'd you miss an entire fucking monkey? Albeit a small monkey, but it's still a monkey just the same. Laith, i have a monkey on my leg. How could this night get any more ridiculous? I mean, come on. Look, that thing tried to kill me, okay? Well, it failed. It failed. It failed miserably. [Monkey chattering] [electronic beeping] shit. Come on. [Electronic beeping] huh, huh? It's not my fault. I had a monkey stuck to my face. Ah. (H utto) watch out. Oh, great. My insurance company's gonna love this. You're kidding, right? You can't report this. Why not? Th ey'll link you somehow. How would they do that? Well, for one thing, you killed him. Don't worry. My cousin's got a body shop. He'll fix it. How am i supposed to dig with the monkey on my leg? Adapt.

I think we broke his arm. Really? Yeah, look. Can we just cover him up and get the hell out of here? I got to piss. Oh, can you do that with a monkey on your leg? (Bobby) stop, stop, guys, guys, stop. What, did the monkey bite your dick off? We can't bury him here. What? Oh, shit. We can't bury him here; they're gonna build on it. (Bobby) yeah, well, what did you guys expect? It's a country of strip malls, sprawling suburban neighborhoods. We should have taken him out to the tree farm or something. But we'd have to get on the highway to do that. Hey, nobody develops water. There's a 24-hour hardware store not far from here. So? So we'll get what we need to put him in the river. Yeah, we can take him out by the old shipyards, out by billy's dock. Perfect. Yeah, and it's deep out there. Well, that's all fine and dandy-- fine and dandy? What? You have a monkey on your leg. Aren't vve forgetting something? The trunk. We can't put a body in a trunk that doesn't close. Well, we'll just have to clean him up. [Serene folk music] (john r.

Yeah, the one where they get off on accidents. (Laith) yeah. So can you tell me please what the hell that's supposed to be? I don't know. I mean, they get into a head-on collision, and one guy goes from one window, and then he goes through another window. And then what's her name? Rosanna arquette? No, the other one. Yeah, yeah, crazy bitch takes out her tl i i y, and she starts making a face like she's shitting steel wool. What is that? [Sighs] i don't know. What's wrong with you? Do you have to ask? (Mark) no, no, it's something else, something personal. You're doing that sigh, look away, quiet laith thing. [Sighs] rebecca and me got into a fight. Please, not this again. I never got to tell you. Okay, yeah, so he gets in the shower, and a monkey jumped on his face, with his beautiful girlfriend because she has a penis. No, no, the monkey has nothing to do with why i haven't had sex. That makes no sense. It probably makes about as much sense as what you're about to say. Who says i'm gonna tell you anything? Wait, stopped having sex with her? I'm telling you, man, he's lost his mind. I haven't stopped. I just haven't felt it lately. So you're not having sex with her; why? He's a gay. Like you care. I care, laith. Look, with her, you're laith with a big bowl of eye candy. Without her, you're just you. She really does add a wonderful new dimension. She is really hot, monkey. She really, really is. I'll bet-- i'll bet you her vagina tastes like a perfect combination-- all right, all right, you guys want to know or not? (Hutto) actually, i'd rather just talk about her fruity vagina. (Laith) it's about her vibrator. (H utto) ooh. Vibrator? I tried to tell you, like, ten times. All right, just tell the vibrator story or get out of the car. (Laith) okay. The other day, i was in the shower, and i reached down for-- the beginning of the story again. You're in the shower, you reached down for the shampoo, and you got a big vibrator. (Laith) yeah, it was big too. So what? You got curious, stuck that bad boy up your ass, and now you're feeling guilty about it? Who hasn't had a big vibrator up their ass? I was-- i was kidding. Bobby didn't react to that. What? Yeah, one time. And believe me, friends. It is not a finger. I didn't stick it up my ass, okay? Well, what did you do with it? Nothing. What's the point of the fucking story, laith? That is the point oh, good. I'm so proud of you that you resisted the awesome temptation of sticking that big vibrating dick up your ass. Listen, assholes, the point of the story is that she has a vibrator. And, obviously, she uses it, otherwise, why would it be in the shower? Wait, the point of the story is that she has a vibrator and she uses it? Do you think she never plays with herself? No, girls are different when it comes to masturbating. Yeah, they need more of a reason than being awake. So this is why you're not having sex? Wow. You know, this is why i don't listen when you speak. I told you: shower, monkey, penis face. Come on, i'm serious. Makes about as much sense. Hey, the monkey's off your leg. He misses daddy. Look at him. Oh, free at last. Go, play with the dead. See if i care. Oh, dude, you missed your turn. Well, if you guys would shut up for half a second. [Tires squealing] (bobby) he's got his dick. I'm gonna puke. (Mark) holy shit. That's vvhat reed was talking about. What? The monkey's giving reed a handy. Well, get it off. You want me to give reed a handy? Looks like it's gonna be a happy ending. Enough with the wordplay. Just get the monkey off his dick. Stop the car. (Bobby) how do you stop a monkey from giving a dead guy a hand job? (H utto) just grab it. (Mark) the dick or the monkey? The monkey, dude; stop. [Retching] laith 's puking, great. See what you've reduced laith to? Bad, bad monkey. Okay, you don't have to do that anyiviore. Just as a friend. [Siren wails] (hutto) you've got to be kidding me. Laith, close your fucking door right now. (Mark) what are we gonna do? Just-- everybody relax. Relax? I'm sitting next to a dead guy who's getting a hand job from a monkey. Put this on his head; put it on his head. Now he's drunk, okay? We're all drunk except for hutfo. What about his dick? What? His dick is still out. Fuck that; marks the doctor. You're wearing gloves. So are you, and you've done this kind of thing before okay, be quick. I'm putting his dick away. The gloves, everybody take your gloves off. (Mark) why is he just standing there? He's standing in laith's puke. (H utto) oh, great. Officer? Please roll the window down completely. I'm sorry. You gentlemen lost'? That u-turn you did up the ways back: but illegal. I'm sorry; i missed my turn. Yeah, i bet you did. [Taps on glass] why did you vomit on my road? Uh, i guess i had too much to drink. You guess? No, sir, you did have too much to drink. Yes, sir. Do you know what vomit gives to a roadside scavenger? Excuse me? It's a free meal, boy. What do you think happens to one of these roadside scavengers when his nose is buried in a pile of puke? I--um-- i don't-- of course you don't. Roll the window back up. What do we got here, huh? A car full of drunkies looking for the next party? No, sir. What about you, brewster? You been drinking tonight? No, sir. This your car? No, it's his. What's your story? Drunk, sir, very drunk. Good lord, son. What did you do, call chuck norris a pansy? [Laughs] chuck norris. That's funny, sir. I'm drunk too. Step out of the car, please. Come on. Nice job, pukey. You're not fucked. Yes, i am; i'm totally fucked. Well, if you're fucked, we're all fucked. We are; we are all fucked. I'm going to prison. Oh, calm down. I'm never gonna make it on the inside. They're gonna do with me what they want. Did you guys see midnight express? You're not going to a turkish prison. Look at what you did, man. This is all my fault. It's not all your fault. Yeah, what are you talking about, laith? I messed up reed's car. Dude, it's cool. There was a monkey on your face. No, before he came to your house. What? I freed the animals. Well, most of them. You owe me $50. Mark, mark, it was an accident. Well? He's running my license. An d? And i don't know. It's just-- everybody stay calm. Did he say anything else at all? Yeah, he seemed to lighten up a bit once he realized i wasn't drunk. But i don't know. Officer brooks is a bit of a freak. Here he comes. (H utto) calm, just stay calm. I'm gonna let you off with a warning. Thank you, sir. No, thank you. If it wasn't for people like you, i'd be scraping drunkies off the side of the road 24-7. You drunkies owe this man your life. I hope y'all realize that. (All) yes, sir, thank you. (Bobby) thank you, hutfo. You watch them illegal u-turns. You can't be driving around with that thing bouncing like that. Mother of pearl! (Bobby) that's my monkey, sir. Will you look at that? [Laughs] hi, little feller. [Laughs] aren't you just the cutest little thing? He's not drunk, is he? No, sir. Oh. (Bobby) uh, he really likes you, sir. Of course he does. Now, you folks, you get home safe. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. [Smooching noises] [sighs] thank god. He's coming back. What? Fuck. This isn't good. Why does he want to talk to me? Yes, sir? I couldn't help but notice that your partied-out friend there is the only one wearing his seat belt. Now, legally, you're not required to wear a seat belt in the backseat. So i can't give you a ticket. But i can give you some advice. Seat belts really do save lives as much in the back as they do in the front. Now, maybe it ain't cool to wear a seat belt in the back. But you know what else ain't cool? Ow. Bein' dead. (Bobby) yes, sir. We'll put them on right away, sir. Put it on, dude. He's gonna have one hell of a headache. [Laughs] (bobby) yeah, that's it, a headache. I cannot believe we're not going to jail right now. (Mark) you okay? You mad? No, it's cool. And what was the pukey thing all about? I don't know. That guy was-- he was something else. Is he worried about roadkill? Well, do you remember when bobby ran off the road trying to avoid that possum? Yeah. He totaled his car. Mm-hmm. There it is. He broke his leg. I remember. What, you don't get the connection? What? Wow, grab a bag of gravel. Watch out. Excuse me. Do you know where the pool supplies are? Yeah, right up there on aisle 'l9, near the home and garden section. Thank you. You push the cart. Fine. So how long you gonna be mad at laith? How long is forever? Oh, we're holding grudges now? Do you remember when he wouldn't talk to me for six months because i slept with suze? Oh, come on. That was high school. Whatever, this is way worse. Suze didn't hold a loaded gun in his mouth and pull the trigger. He really liked her. Whatever. Is that the girl that bobby's always going on about over at monty's? I don't know; i've heard about her. I've never seen her. She's definitely his type though. It's got to be her; i'm sure of it. Just ask her. Ask her what? "Excuse me, are you the chick that my friend likes i mean, come on. (Woman) h ey. Don't you hang out at monty's sometimes? Yeah, yeah, i thought i recognized you. I'm angi. I'm laith. James. James? Yeah, what? Just one-- should i have used a fake name too? That's my first name, jackass. What, you think my parents named me hutfo? No, i thought your first name was jay. Jay is short for james. Christ, i've known you since grade school. Well, yeah, but we weren't that close back then. And if it wasn't for bobby in the sixth grade-- you're an idiot. [Laughs] sorry. (Woman) that'll be $164.89. Afraid so. Hey, um, where's your friend? The one with the mustache and th e-- yeah, bobby, he's-- uh-- he's outside in the car. At his house. What? He's at his-- he's in his car at his house. They're fumigating his apartment right now, which is why he's in the car at his house. Well, not at his house as in in his house. I mean, he's outside his house in his car. I offered to let him stay at my house, but he was way too proud. Too proud. Too proud. That's bobby for you, huh? [Laughs] but it was nice meeting you. We got to take off. You too. Um, hey, tell your friend bobby i said "hi." (H utto) hey, bobby. You know that girl you're always talking about, the one from monty's? Yeah. She was just in line. She says to say "hi." Get the fuck out of here. Eh, i wouldn't get your hopes up. What did you do? Nothing. Everybody put your gloves back on. I didn't do anything. Here, i got it. [Tires squealing] (bobby) i'm too proud? That doesn't even make sense. Why did you tell her that? (Laith) it all happened so fast. Hutfo crushed my foot. (Hutto) well, i didn't want her coming out to the car. Well, what is she gonna think about me? Too proud? [Upbeat country music] (woman) i my baby love me the way that he do i ♪ chqo choo ♪ i don't want no gray skies making me blue i ♪ boo hoo ♪ i oh, here comes the rain i i i'm trying to find a way to handle my mess i (bobby) she said to say "hi"? Yeah. To me? Yes. So she really said to say "hi"? Yes, after everything he said, she still said to say "hi." Why is that so hard to believe? (Bobby) well, i don't know, maybe because i'm too proud. I mean, what were you thinking? I said i was sorry. Did she say her naivie? Angi. [Squeaking] the monkey says i should kick your ass for saying that. Well, tell the monkey you should grow some balls and talk to girls. The monkey says that you should shut up, or he's gonna bite your balls off. Tell the monkey that if bobby and laith don't shut the fuck up, huttcts gonna be disposing of three bodies tcdnight. That refer to themselves in third person are gay. You know what, dude? You better hope she doesn't think of me as some-- i don't know-- proud guy? Go get the other stuff. Yeah. That was funny. "The raft master rapid 5000 water sport extreme fun time float"? What? It's all they had left. So who else is getting wet? Oh, we all know that's not happening. Dude, monkey. I'm not going out there by myself. Hey, it's your dead body. Yeah. (Laith) i'll go. Are you kidding? So many jokes come to mind right now. [Monkey chattering] [bell buoy dinging] why am i wearing water wings? They're really for laith, but i could just make him wear 'em. I just want you two to know how proud i am of you. Hey, let's go. [Splashing] are you gonna give that thing a nam e? Yeah, i was thinking freddy. Yeah. Freddy's a good name for a monkey. Ithink so. Do you ever miss it? What? This, you know, the way it used to be. Did one of us kill someone before? No, you know what i mean. Yeah, sometimes, i guess. I spend most of my time missing her though, you know? Listen, i want to tell you something. Okay. I'm just gonna say it, and we never have to talk about it again. All right? I don't want you sleeping on lisa's grave anymore. It's wrong, and you know it. Yeah, i know. It's just hard sometimes, you know? I know, man. I know. [Monkey chattering] sure, i know some people still only think of him as dirty harry or the man without a name. That's fromthe good, the bad, and the ugly, right? Yeah. Which is nothing to be ashamed of. You know, but you had two best directing oscars. I mean, he's one of the greatest filmmakers of our time... yeah, yeah. Anyone's time. I just don't know how anyone could disagree. No, i agree. You know, what i don't understand is how someone who loves film as much as you, went to film school, can come up with the crazy shit about movies you do, is doing in jacksonville editing weddings. I was in new york. Yeah, for a week. You sound like rebecca. Well, she's a smart girl. Might want to listen to her. Yeah, i guess. Look, about earlier, you know, the whole vibrator thing, please, don't talk about how sweet her pussy tastes. No, no. See, i understand what you were talking about. You do? Yeah, yeah, see, the vibrator infiltrated your insecurities, made you feel like less of a man. Yeah, exactly, like i wasn't good enough, you know? Well, at least you don't think it's stupid. No, no, it is stupid. But i understand, because i'm stupid too. So she took an extra-long bath and pulled it out. Big deal. Your girlfrienus horny, man. She's horny. Be celebrating that. Is this-- uh, is this far enough? Yeah, yeah. You know, we haven't had sex in two weeks. Because of the vibrator? Well, it's like you said. I feel like i can't satisfy her. If we could satisfy every woman every time the way they satisfy us, they would be men, and that would be disgusting. I guess. The vibrator doesn't have to be your foe, my friend. What do you mean? You know what i mean. Really? Yeah. You think? Do it; trust me. She will love you forever. Push. God, he's a heavy fucker. Jesus. [Gurgling] we did it. It's over. Hey, thanks for helping me, man. Any time. Let's just get the hell out of here. That was kind of anticlimactic, huh? Yeah. What was that? What? You've got to be kidding me. I knew it was too good to be-- dude, we must have had 100 pounds of gravel-- wait, wait, wait, shh. [Whispering] what does it mean? Shit, that's an alligator. It's an alligator. What do we do? Shh, it's an alligator. Don't move, shh. Move, move. Get up. [Splashing] be quiet. Is it there? I don't know. Well, look. You look; i'm not looking. Fuck that. Get your feet up. My feet are up. Play dead. Don't move, don't move. I don't think this is really fooling him, mark. Where did he go? I don't know. Well, where are we going? I don't know. How are we gonna get back to the dock?
