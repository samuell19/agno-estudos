A FABIENNE GODET FILM OUR AWESOME LIVES FOR AGNÈS AND PASCAL Hello. Easy, now. -The room is ready. -Thank you. This is Annette, the lady of the house. Margot, welcome. Lisa, who you will be sharing your room with. Hey. Welcome. There, in front. Pierre, it's just the way it was said, really. -Come on, hurry up! -You know what I mean? -You want the same one? -Yeah. -How's it going, girls? -Good, you? Yeah, I'm good. -We have 'living together,' hurry up. -Nah, I'm not going. -Antoine needs me. -Can you replace me? Um, no. -Please? -No. Come on! Come on, get over here. Ditch the broom and come. I'll put the books in the library. No reading in the rooms. Where are you from, Margot? Châlons. We're neighbors. Yeah. You can put that away later. I'll take you to the nurse's office, and then you can join the group. Do you have any cash or a credit card? Thank you. 95 euros and a credit card. I'll give this to Annette. She handles money, here. I'm going to take a look in your bag. I'm taking this. The MP3 player. I'll take your phone, too. You can get it back in 10 days. I don't care, nobody knows I'm here. What were you mostly consuming? Alcohol, meds, coke. Speed. Alcohol in what amounts? Everything I had on hand. What time would you start? When I woke up. What would you drink? It depended on the period. It depended on my finances. Can you tell me more about your med consumption? Skenan and licodium, mainly. Then, ritalin. At the end, valium. In what quantities? As much as I could snag. And coke? Do I need to know anything about your physical condition, is there anything I should write in your file? Everything hurts and I always want to throw up. Can you cough, please? DAY 2 When I got here, I realized I didn't have any friends. I was looking through my phone, making an inventory... I thought I had loads of friends, too. People just passed through my life. I became part of no one's life and I didn't let anyone into mine. You don't put in the work, here. I've invited you to come jog with me loads, you've told me to fuck off. -I'm with you. -I ask a favor of you, you refuse. He's difficult regardless, but... -The thing is you don't listen... -When there are coffee cups to clean, he won't do it. Or only grudgingly. -Speak slowly. -That's not everything. Yeah but he's an old timer. -That's not true. -Salomé, any thoughts? When I needed cash for my kid. Salomé talks a lot, but in her head. -I would've paid you back, dammit! -You're a pain. I don't agree with you. -I'm in the same boat as you. -He's doing fine. You always want to save him. -You can't be afraid of me. -It helps me. You must approach him. -Does this make you laugh? -Make an effort. You find this funny, Samuel? It's not because of your story. I'm incapable of... ... of building something with someone. You and your beanie. It's a pain in the ass. People just lay into you right away. Are you scared of being abandoned, Jérémy? -How's it going, Dylan? -Good, you? What are you doing here? It's one day at a time, here. You mustn't think of the next day. If I told myself I'd never drink again, I'd die. Group talks aren't my thing. That's not why I'm here. Why are you here, then? To kick the habit. Not to lay out my life. If you aren't well, you have the others. We've all been through this. I'm nothing like those people. I used to say that, too. I quit 15 years ago. At the time, I didn't know I was suffering. I got into because it felt good. Using was all that mattered. I can't handle 10 weeks like this. Can you handle 10 weeks in the gutter? Stay. Just for today. Tomorrow, you'll see. DAY 3 How are you doing? Sorry, that's a dumbass question. When I got here, I was terrified. And I was getting these insane migraines. -How long have you been here? -Five weeks. It's my wife. She wanted me to come here. I want to get through this, for her and for my daughter. I tried to beat it loads of times alone. And each time, I fell back into it, I relapsed. Do you have kids? No. I have an 8-year-old daughter. She's going to start coming on visits soon. Here, look. Look how pretty she is. She's beautiful. Where are you from? What does it matter? Look at Pierre. That reminds me of my dad. He'd take me to the forest, as a kid. My favorite game was finding nests in the trees. I loved it. You see those 4 people outside? One of them will make it, another one will relapse and maybe come back here. The other two, you don't know. Got a smoke? Yeah. Here. -No, I can't take your last one. -Yes, go ahead. In 10 days, you'll go to the café. There's a smoke shop in the village café. And you'll buy some smokes. No, keep it. Thanks. DAY 7 Where's Salomé? In the office. Antoine's. She hasn't slept for a week. -Seriously? -Yeah. That's rough. -Can I use the shower? -Yeah. Oh, I need to talk to Alex... Anyone want water? Careful, you'll wind up... No, because I saw... I've been around there before. That's it, right? Who said that? Thanks. There's nothing to eat here, as usual. Feeling better? You sure? It took me three weeks to feel alright. Fuck's sake! DAY 10 My name is Margot, I'm 32 years old. I come from a fairly well-off family. I have a brother, Guillaume, 4 years my senior, and a big sister, Justine. She's 2 years older than me and physically disabled. I love my sister, but it has always been a bit difficult for me, because I often felt like my parents were projecting onto me their hopes of having a "normal" daughter. I feel like they passed the anxiety, but not the confidence, on to me. Come on, you big bull! Yeah! Show me those legs. That's it, go on! I was one of those anxious children. Extremely anxious. My mom took up work again when my sister turned 10. She'd help my dad at the pharmacy. As a result, she wasn't there much. I didn't see my father much either. Weirdly, he's who I have the most memories with. Follow the rhythm. My father. I always got along well with him. This is when I started sipping on forgotten drinks when we had family parties. Things got worse when I started literary prep school. I went to Paris, to the Lycée Condorcet. And then, things got insane real quick. I went out every night. Speed, coke... I got addicted fast. I dropped out of Condorcet. I got gigs as a server in bars. Go ahead. Without judgment. You do it, too. Open your jaw! Come on, roar, people! Yeah! I'm Daniel, I've been clean for five weeks. Welcome. Good job, Salomé. Your shoulders... Come on, my big monkey! Salomé, 19 days clean. Welcome. I got fire several times because of my habit. But I didn't care. All I wanted to do was get high. Go ahead! Yeah! Hi, I'm Sonia. I've been clean six weeks. Welcome, Margot. I started hanging out in shady places. With girls who were losing their way, doing whatever with their bodies. It scared me. I screwed a guy just to get coke. Then, I decided to go to Berlin to come off a bit. I got high a lot, but it wasn't very festive. I was isolated there, so getting high and isolation went hand in hand. I didn't get that using was the problem. So, I kept switching drugs up. I'd change jobs, boyfriends, locations, and each time, I'd relapse again. I still wonder today how I managed to stay alive. The last time I got real high was one night, for world music day. We knocked back 3 or 4 bottles each with a friend and took pills. I woke up in the hospital. I woke up in the hospital often. I wanted to thank you for staying with us. It's moving, to me. You got here, you felt alone, like almost all of us, but now, you have brothers, sisters, same as I found when I came here. There. So, know that I'm here, and that I'll always be there for you. Thank you. It's hard to trust people, we aren't used to it anymore. But here is precisely where you can seize that opportunity, and I wish with all my heart that it'll work out for you. What drives me nuts is to think of all that time spent without feeling anything. Your feelings are completely shut off, you live like a ghost, wander like a ghost among ghosts. It's a significant amount of time lost. But, I mean, welcome. You'll quickly realize that we aren't all alone. We all have tend to think we're alone when we arrive, that we're weaker than the others, than our family, and all that. But our willpower and determination is much stronger than people who have never used. Because despite all we've shoved down our throats, nostrils, livers, we're still able to stop. I'm not sure others could do the same. And if only for that, you're dope as hell. You're stronger than others, for real. DAY 13 Thank you. -Hey, chill! -Come here, Léo. -Here. -Thanks. Margot. -Here. -Thanks. Come on. Thanks. Go ahead. A yellow, an orange, and red one. And we'll play hopscotch. That's lovely, sweetie. Can you pass me to Mom? Yeah, no. You can't be late to school. We'll hang up on three, alright? One... Three. Daddy! No, you have to hang up, honey. Alright, till five. I love you, Dad. You're the prettiest girl in the world. I love you, sweetheart. Hey, Justine, girl. It's Margot. I've gone to the country to take a break with some friends. Everything's fine. I'll call you back soon. I hope you're alright, too. There. Take care. See you. You alright? Sorry, I know, it's a dumbass question. It's a really fucking dumbass question. The first time we split up, in terms of my daughter, it was alright, I was able to manage OK. One Sunday night, I went to my wife's. Can you tell us what you'd taken? I'd drank a lot. And I'd taken some brown sugar. I rang. She came down. I had a knife on me, and I stuck it under her throat. I said, "Next time you keep me from my daughter, I'll slit your throat." I left. She called the cops, and they showed up. Those bastards caught me 200 yards on. They said to me... I... I had the knife, I wanted to shank that son of a bitch. I had 2 grams on me. They took me to a holding cell. And then, I put my head on the wall. I banged my head, banged it, banged it against the cell, so they'd open up. Then, when I came out, my friends said: "You need to get out of this, "you need to chill out, you're going nuts. "You'll kill someone." There you go. There is an episode that reminds me of the last time I remember, that reminds me of my real anger. It was my sister, at the table. We were with our parents, we were eating in peace, and then suddenly, she blurted out to my dad: "Did you know Léo was offering selling his body for heroin?" I'm no fag. I flipped out. I flipped the table over, I pounced on her, and... Now, she wears dentures. I identify with what Jalil and Léo said. I'd lost my job and I didn't have any money, any dough left. Why did you lose your job? Because I was getting too high. Since I was my section leader, I had to do this job I didn't like doing. After kind of selling off everything in the house, I started relying on my wife. I would take money from her purse, her wallet, directly. One day, she... She caught me red-handed. I grabbed her by the hair, dragged her into the bedroom, and I hit her in the face. She called the cops, they showed up, hand-cuffed me... And then I was in the detention center in Bobigny. Were you often violent? Frequently in my last year, yes. And I'm ashamed. It disgusts me and I... I can't go back and that's the image that... I share your feeling of shame. Try to tell us what happened, Sonia. It was... with my daughter. She was tiny. There was a bottle of rum on the table, and she poured it down the sink. And then, I stopped being myself. I became violent. Violent how? I threw things at her, and verbally, I... We're with you. We all look so... We all have such hangdog looks on our faces. You find it funny? You know what I mean. It's in the past. It's important to talk about it, but I mean... Maybe we're also here to forget that past. Of course, and that's good, you have to get it off your chest, but you have to break your shell, too. You have to laugh about it, too. -We're here, that's great. -There are other ways. Do other people's feelings bother you that much? No, but I mean right now, we all have bags under our eyes, we're... -It's a bit... -Margot, what's it bring up for you? Anger, violence. What does that bring up for you? I'm not very violent. Free up your hands, Margot. Try and tell us what's happening, right now, in your gut. It's really not herbal tea I need, now. You know I can't give you meds. It'd put you back on a chemical path. DAY 17 How do you feel, this morning? I don't know. You want to call your family? No. Are you planning on doing so? Jalil, you have mail. Léo? Léo? You redo the one you did, and you add the consequences. The consequences of when you were taking crack. So, he comes to get me, but I'm the one in trouble, not him. -You know what I mean? -Yeah. He came and saw you, so, you were in a state... Yeah, I was high. And how do you feel about that? It's important to write it down. You have to go a little further. "Loads of chicks... -"get real uptight..." -Come on, shut up, for real! Even quietly, like that, it's a pain. "Whenever a man goes near them..." ... Well, how I feel about it... Hey! I can't think straight, it's pissing me off. I already hate writing. I like learning, but not writing. "This one's a real male!" "He's got big muscles." -Stop it! -"He's the king of the tough guys." -Stop it! -"I need a male!" Alright, leave me alone, now. Write your drug-user tales. No, but it's wild! The guy just cuts trees down, in one go. I saw him in real life in Savoy. They straight up take a whole tree, bring it back with a draft horse, and chop it into logs. Can I get the vinaigrette? You too, hon? Will you pass it to me, after? You alright, Jalil? Yeah, I'm doing great. Can't you tell? Thanks. It's not his day. Cutting huge trunks as fast as possible. Fuck, I love cucumber. I think... Hey, close your mouth when you're eating, seriously. How about shutting your trap? -What's wrong? -Shut your trap. I didn't do anything to you. Jalil! "I don't want this life for you or me." I didn't make that up. She also says: "Trying to come up with another way of being together, "finding what we can't together elsewhere. "Are we capable of that?" She's asking you questions, here. She's with you. I can't do it, without her. I can't do it. Well, I can't do it without you. I need you. Must be the first time anyone needs me. The garden won't last the winter without you. Only you and Pierre can care for it. The first time my wife and I split up, I went to pick up my girl from school. She was five. She looked at me and said: "I have a secret to tell you. "I have a big secret." So, in my head, I had all these images, all these thoughts coming up. I freaked out. She was living with her mom at her grandparents'. In this luxury shack in the country. I'd found a place. It wasn't great, but I tried to set it up as best I could. And then, we got to my place, and I asked my sweet pea: "So, what's your secret, then?" She said, "Dad, I wanted to tell you "that your house is ugly." I wanted to cry. It's true my place wasn't great. It wasn't out of lack of taste, I was just doing my best. I tried to make it work, to do lots of things. It broke my heart. When my kiddo left, I went right back to the habit. One day, she'll like your place. I promise. Go on, go ahead! Yeah. You've got it! -It's out. -Out! 1-0. Go ahead. Yeah, you've got it. You got it! Yeah! Next time, go up to the net. Stop, stop. Go on! That's it. No. -3-0! -Sorry. -Nice! -Good job. Nice! Good job! Awesome, Pierre! Won't you tell me your age? Say it in Russian, I won't get it. -What does that mean? -Not telling. And you? How can you have so many twos? I don't get it. I haven't even played yet. This deck is weird. I think it has the wrong cards. That's not quite it. I don't know how to play. 50 years old, got a few teeth missing, I'm a junkie and a fag, I've had taken things in every hole, you can imagine, poppers, ketamine, brown sugar, MDMA, the Jacques-Yves Cousteau of mood-enhancers, I come back to you from the depth. I identify myself, you ratify me, I place you and that's enough, you're from the ghetto, I went to Ivies, and yet here we are together, blasting all our fake friends, throwing up all of our whiskey, getting high on energy, saying fuck your dealer and fuck my hubby. so-so-solidarity so-so-so-solidarity so-so-solidarity I'm going in circles, I'm starting again, when there's no more then there is more, the gin is empty, my man's dead, and the window has a ledge, I want to come and come again, my fingers and my clit are ready, for their rehabilitation, and not for capitulation. And a good thing, too! Joined together, we've all scored but now we don't, Joined together, smiling to protect each other, Joined together, not always saints, come on, dream on Joined together, so we can all leave here with pride-ide-ide-ide-ide! You wanted to cash in, druggy, and party, you fucked it up, had buddies talk behind your back, come on pal, let's talk quit acting like a tough guy, you're not going to relapse for some fucking peach schnapps! Yeah! And you, Margot? You have anyone coming? No. What about you? Is Sascha coming? Of course. -And for you, too? -Yeah. I bet you can't get "piss" into the next therapy meeting. I don't get it. Like, you can't just say "piss" during the next group therapy. 1,000 bucks says you can't do it. Want to bet? How much? -My respect for life. -No, how much? -Come on, you lout. My respect! -How much? For life, I'll respect you. Alright, done. -You'll get it in there? -For sure. They can't catch on. DAY 18 It's when I went to Paris for prep school, I was working a little, but I didn't have much money, and each time I went back to my parents', on the weekend, I'd nab a fair number of meds from the pharmacy's stock. What meds? In what quantities? I think I'd take 10 to 15 boxes. One weekend when I was back, I heard my parents talking about how they'd fired Christine, who was the woman who worked at the pharmacy when my mom couldn't. They thought she was behind the theft. So, I don't know, I was feeling so bad, then, I'd felt so alone since I'd... Margot, what about the consequences for the sacked employee? You're focusing on yourself again a bit. Well, she was fired. Yes, that's all. -Not so bad. -I didn't say it wasn't bad, I'm just unaware of the consequences, I don't know the other consequences. I haven't talked to my parents in years, or barely, anyway. -And so... -Stay with Christine, Margot. Don't go away. Stay with Christine. Christine got fired because she was accused of stealing meds that you had stolen. Well, I didn't know how to react, at the time. And now, how do you feel about Christine's sacking? Well, shame, also. I'm ashamed. Do you think she's ashamed? You guys trying at all, today? It feels like everyone's asleep. We're letting Margot tell her story. Nobody's confronting her. I'm just pissed today. And Raja, where are you? I'm with my family right now. I'm kind of struggling to listen to the story. Sorry. Want to come back? I'm trying. I feel like you don't give a damn about what happened to Christine. Like you don't care, you're just saying it. -Dylan. -What? Can you not speak that way? I just feel like you don't give a fuck. You're talking about this chick who got fired because of you, because of your bullshit. You stole stuff, but it seems like you don't care. Like it flows through you like water. She must've found a new job. I fucked my life up, not hers. You don't know that. It's really hard to find a job. Thank you, Jérémy. Very interesting, what you just said. But what... How did it affect you, at the time? What did you feel? César, at the time isn't what matters. Do you remember what was going on when you were 17? -Well, yeah. -Oh, really. That's great, César. I remember, for instance, earlier, I said I was pissed. This morning, I woke up bawling. OK? One day, my mom was making pistou, at home, and my dad, he beat her up. He was a drunk. I'm sorry. So, this morning, I'm pissed, too, about that pistou! It just clicked. That was when I started to drink. I mean, it affected me. How do you experience César's sadness, Margot? You won't look at him, your eyes are lowered. You won't let your head hang. I'm sorry. I don't know. You don't know? No. It's hard, because ever since I got here, each time I... my feelings, you make it clear that those aren't my feelings, or that they don't exist, or something. So, I don't know what to do, really. I can't help it if you don't think me saying I'm ashamed is real shame. We're the problem. No, I didn't say that. I said, "I don't know what to do." There are no "musts" or "mustn'ts." Apparently, there are, because when I say stuff, you say I mustn't do that. So, there must be better ways to do it. I'm just asking you to be honest. It's hard, really. To tell someone they aren't being honest. How can you say that to me? You're telling your story like a machine. You're reeling it off, getting rid of it all. Acting like a good student. There are no good grades, here. -I don't think she's trying... -César. Excuse me. Give the feelings a bit of room to breathe. Salomé, your leg. Does it make you nervous, hearing all this? It's really funny, what's going on here. Chill out. You can let loose once and then not talk about it again. What is shame? Is it a feeling? I don't know that I really want to answer. I don't know. Ah, now Salomé's reacting. This makes you laugh? Well... -It is true that... -César. Yes, sorry. For me, shame is when you've hurt the people you love so much you can't look at yourself in the mirror. That's shame, for me. Can you say that to Margot, and use "I"? I've hurt the people I love so much I can't look at myself. That's shame. That's all! I just said, "what is shame?" We've all stolen. I've stolen, too. When I lived with my mom, I stole money from her every day. I robbed her clean. Yeah. I'm going to go see mine soon. I'm going to leave this place and go back to the homeland. The work here sure isn't easy. Doing everything they ask you to do. Sometimes, you want to explode. Sometimes, they drive you so nuts, you want to tear their hair out. Margot's dragging this weight. I spent my life dragging it. I was ashamed of myself. But it's also how they talk to you. You're the same age as them. -But it makes sense. -We're not talking about "if ever." What if you were allowed just one memory in heaven? Just one thing you'd want to remember. What would it be? -Sit down. -Just one memory. I know right off the bat. It's when my mom came and picked me up from my host family and took me in her arms. Aw, that's so cute. Why you always try and make us cry? Relax, it's my fondest memory. The day my stepmother died, I went to see her a few hours beforehand. When she saw me walk in, she said: "Get out!" And as I was leaving, from the door, before I left, I said: "Fuck off!" She heard your prayers. It's funny, I don't have too many memories. Maybe it's better that way, really. Why do you say that? I don't know. I feel like my whole childhood is blacked out. -Shhh! -What a dumbass! Stop it, no! Get out of here! What time is it? They're taking advantage of it, the fuckers. Come on. How about you, César? What memories would you take to heaven? Well, the issue is I'm not like that. -I don't work that way. -What are you like, then? Are you going to cut me off every 2 seconds? You're getting on my nerves. I'm talking, here. If you look back, you're a dead man. Oh, yeah? Listen to me, Léo: I swear, because I'm calm today, but otherwise... OK? So, don't be a pain. Because during my prison years, that's how I learned to be. -You see? -Yes. There. You don't look behind you. Out of mental hygiene. -Mental hygiene? -Yes. And now, it's a part of me. But if you could just take one memory to heaven, what would it be? You going to ask that fucking question all night? I'm answering! Goddammit. I'm sorry, but... She's a moron, this is insane. Did you hear my reasoning or not? DAY 19 -Hello, Pierre. -Hello. -They're nice, aren't they? -Beautiful. -Do you want a coffee? -Yes, please. Thanks. -Margot, you want another coffee? -No, thanks. Here, try this. Just like this? Is it good? It's sweet, I've never tried it. You want more? Here. I have to be careful, I'll get addicted. Especially as they only grow in winter. Can you hear the birds singing? DAY 22 Did you figure that out by yourself? Yes. He's clever, my son is. It's three times two, six. Seven, eight, nine. Nine plus three? Twelve. -Nice. -13, 14, 15, 16. To which we must add the modest sum of 50 points as a bonus. Why? 82! The champion. Hang on. Why 50 points? "Scrabble." "Scrabble." 50. You take 7 letters out of the bag. -Great job. -Are you dependent, too? Have you looked at me? Have you seen what I'm like? I'm the healthiest guy on earth. Totally normal. That means my mom isn't normal. No, honey. Alright. So, when it's already down... -Be right back -You don't count the word you add to? That's right. I'll take her place, but not play. -That's lovely. -Thanks, mom. Do you have the meds I asked for? I called your therapist, Lisa. You did what? I called your therapist. Why did you do that? You called Antoine? I'm going to get in such deep shit! I could get kicked out. You dumbass, how could you do that? -Because she's mean to me. -No, no. -No. -She hates me. No, that's the way it is. If she's not nice... You know your teacher isn't nice this year, so you have to make do. Alright? You aren't only going to meet nice people who will support you in your life. It's up to you to kind of... Because otherwise, you lose. You see? That matters. Next year... -No, that doesn't work, here. -What? The "e" is an "a" and the "j" is a "g," in "strange," so it doesn't work. There's no way? There's not no way, there is the absence of a way. You dumbass. Well, "je." Yes. "Jet"? That doesn't mean anything. "Jet"! Like a jet of water. Oh, I'd have spelled it "ai." You're light as a feather. See you next time. It was awesome meeting you, Sascha. You watch out for my mom. I promise. I'll take care of her. See you next time? Thanks. I'm not too hungry. Very graceful. Good job! And woop! There you go, you land. Breathe deep, confidently. Enjoy giving yourself these deep stretches. Slowly, you're going to get up. A big, straight tree. And exhale. Great job, warriors. Take the time to absorb this great gift from the heavens into your sacred tree. You're so blissful. Feel its warmth, its smell. Its beautiful petals. And deeply inhale this scent of childhood inside you. What the fuck is she up to? Is she not picking up? What the fuck, I don't get it. Don't worry. You can call back this afternoon. DAY 24 What do you think? I think it's "the chronicles of an upcoming relapse." What if we sent her to Nantes to a short-term care facility? I think she's too fragile. We'll work on it with her here, but if she really wants to leave, we can't stop her. -Let's see later? -Yes. OK. Margot? I feel like I have to say something. I heard it, I can't pretend I didn't. Calm down. Breathe. Keep it to yourself. Telling her might do you some good, but it won't do her any. Go to the end of this thing, for sure. That's what matters. Not compensating for lack by pretending. It's what they're always explaining. That fucking mechanism. That's what got me in deep shit, it's why I'm here again. And that's what's a pain. Imagine, you're sick of it now, this is my second time here. Motherfucker! Goddammit! Calm down! -No! -Calm down. Look at him losing it on his own. Let me go, goddammit! Guys, stop! You're insane, dude. -Are you serious? -What's going on? You OK? Did you get any sleep? Meh. How about you? So-so, I'd say. You aren't going to start, are you? Fuck off, you're in front of the mirror, dammit! I'm not done. -Just a second! -Not right now! Hey, girls. Margot, you're changing rooms. There's a new girl coming. Seriously? Oh, come on, goddammit. How nice. -Who will you go with? -No idea. Goddammit. Take care of the family. Can I take your bag? Margot. We've got to go, Raja. See you again for volleyball. Take care of everyone. Stay alive, OK? I'll be back. I'll bring you some cakes from mom. -Yeah. -Alright? I'm here as part of a treatment diversion program. It was a way of not staying in prison, really. Things were alright in jail. I was the tough girl. Well, one of them. I didn't let myself be pushed around. I wasn't afraid of anyone. Until they told me my grandmother had died, and that they weren't granting me permission to go to her funeral. That was the first time in my life I really felt beaten, defeated. I'm not a tough girl, really. I'm not... I'd taken advantage of her trust. I'd promise, in jail, to get out, find a job, and reimburse her without her knowing through gifts, little attentions. But now, I'll never see her again, and I won't ever be able to prove anything to her. When I was a kid, I would sometimes spend days and days without speaking to anyone. Apart from saying "hello" and "goodbye." On those days, you think. You think and think some more. The first time I got wasted, it was nothing. It was calm. It was like my mind had been destroyed. And that's when I understood that that was what I wanted. That it was what I needed. I wanted to stop thinking. DAY 27 Then, girls, you go on cleaning. No. -It's constant. -Washing... That's my thing. No, I'm always in charge of hygiene. I don't see why I have to be the one to sweep up again. I'm putting Margot down. Hey, Margot. Have you seen Jalil? No, why? His stuff isn't in his room, I think he left. He's been in a rut for days. He's probably already getting wasted at the pub next door. Dylan, stop it. This isn't funny. It's true, isn't it? I hope he's having a Pastis for me. Where are you going? Have you seen Jalil? Léo says he left. -We're aware of that. -And you're doing nothing? The doors are open. Everyone is free to come and go. You know Jalil won't come back if he's alone out there. Calm down, Margot. If Sascha asks me how you are, what will I tell him if you leave? What are you doing here? I'm scared. DAY 30 You don't want any cucumber? Why don't you like them? -Hang on, take mine. -With pleasure. You going to eat all that? Is that a problem? Kind of, yeah. You've been gorging for a week. It's compulsive. Why are you doing it? Don't you like cucumbers? They're great for your complexion. -Isn't that carrot? -No, cucumbers. You wear them like this. Jalil died. What did you say, Léo? Jalil. They found his body in a hotel near Grenoble. You've got to accept that some people, well, they don't make it. Eh? It's thanks to him I stayed. What a dumbass! He can't have died for nothing. I don't want to die. You're not going to die. You're not going to die. I thought I was happy, but really, I'd lost something crucial. I didn't know how to love. I'm not able to speak to them. Not as openly as I'd like to. Each word leaves me out of breath. I feel like I'm not experiencing anything. Like I'm always behind my eyes. One time, this guy said to me: "We'll love you until you love yourself." I cried. I spent my time destroying everything that was around me. My brain is still turned towards the dark side. It's as if I was born disabled into this world. I don't want to die. I feel like I've always lived in chains. Nobody asked me if I was suffering. I became an alcoholic over three months. Everything seems fine, but things are dark inside my head. In the end, maybe I'll be able to get better here, even though I wasn't happy. I live in the closet. I'm realizing I've lived my whole life on another planet. There's no reason I can't figure it out. DAY 38 For me, it was the n... at a friend of mine's birthday, when I was 17 or 18. We'd had a fair amount to drink and smoked a bunch. We'd probably taken some molly that night, too. And so, I was alone on my way home, and... I had a bad encounter, some guy tried to come into the building after me. And so, I tried to defend myself and he beat the shit out of me. But he wound up leaving. I went home, everyone was asleep, and I stayed that way. The following morning, my head was pretty bruised up. So... So, my mom said to me: "Look at your face, the situations you put yourself in." I think I was still a bit drunk. Then, she came into my room and said: "Your brother wants to talk to you." So, I went down. He said the same stuff, he said: "Let's not spend hours figuring out how you got here. "The question is what will you do now. "I want answers right now." After a few questions, I wound up saying, "I'm done responding, "now isn't the time." He slapped me twice. And then, I heard my mom... I heard her say: "When will she stop being a pain in the ass?" So, I left the room. I must have pushed the chair over, gotten angry, maybe broken a cup. Anyway, I left angrily. I went and took the gram of coke that was left in my room. And I left. It was crazy. There wasn't a single moment of gentleness. What are we forgetting that matters in this story? Consumption? Her responsibility? Yes. Your consumption and responsibility. I identify with what you said about your nights out. We've all been through that. We've all fucked up. But you decided to get high and to go home at 5 am. All this wouldn't have happened... -Definitely. -If you hadn't got high. The real reason is you. It's your consumption. Imagine your parents and brother. -Do they know you take drugs? -No. Léo, listen a bit. You're always cutting people off. No, I'm asking. Do your parents know you take drugs? -No. -And your brother? They don't know. They don't know you take drugs? Not like that. But they're not dumb. Of course, they know. I identify with this story in terms of my own brother. That story of yours, it's... How, one day... One day, same thing: I came back completely high. I saw him and he flew into this terrible rage. He was furious. He said, " What the fuck are you doing?" I really hurt him. And then... I would say to myself: "That dumbass doesn't get it." But I was the asshole. I was the dumbass. -For sure. -It's that "we" thing. The thing of "we" being for dweebs. What's hard and this is where you're at now, -is to say "I." -Yes. "I, me." "I, Daniel, got my brother into this shit." "I did, me, me!" What did I do to my brother, that night? I don't get it. What had she done that night. -Yes, no, I'd used. -Yes. But what had I done to my brother? Well, she'd hurt him, that's all. If it happens several times, I don't know, it's... You scared him. You scared him, you made them worry, they thought you might not come home. You show up with your face all swollen, you're wasted, you say you threw a chair aside... All this stuff agitates and prevents you from... I mean, I don't know your mom, but it does prevent some communication. The violence you experience, you also inflict it on others. There. We get high, we take all this stuff, we put ourselves into situations we shouldn't put ourselves in, and in which we'd never put ourselves when lucid. -So, sometimes we... -Who is "we"? Us, people who get high, users. And you? Didn't you use, too? You're saying "we." What, me? Yes. And I know it got me into the kinds of situations she's talking about. I don't know. Try to help her, Léo. What do you want me to say? We need to take it easy, here. We're kind of... -Lisa? -... defending her. You're still defending her? Is it hard for you, Margot, not to just see yourself as a victim? I don't know. -You don't care, do you. -It's not that. Let's have a moment of silence. We're going to try to remember why we came here, what would happen when we used, the hurt we caused ourselves. Your silence is busting my balls. Let it come. No, I don't want to let it come. I'm sick of your silence. Come on, cut the sessions short. Hey, Pierre. -You're not eating with the others? -No. You either? No, not today. Want any? No, thanks. You have to eat. Come on. Take a piece. Go on, eat. You seem quiet. I have to stay calm, otherwise I'll damage the walls. -Why didn't you ever get married? -Me? I could've done. When I was 17, I fell in love with a girl in my class. Angèle. We spent hours together. We'd exchange love notes. The others wondered what she saw in me. I was shy. Already a bit autistic, at the time. Then, one day, we did some dumb shit. We got high and we bet we could swim across the Loire. I drowned her. They never found her body. Have you ever been in love? Yes. We could've maybe even got married. I believed in it for a few years, anyway. Then, I got pregnant and we lost the kid around 3 months in. Right after that, he got a job offer abroad and he told me it was a chance to start over, but I couldn't. I didn't have the guts to follow him. I missed out on a unique chance. Refusing was also a unique chance. That's the one you didn't miss on. The one you gave yourself to be here today. You mustn't be sad. I'm not sad about that. I'm sad because I told you. I'd never told anyone. DAY 42 I'm happy to be leaving. But I didn't sleep well last night. I had nightmares. I'd found an apartment and I was in it. I kept getting lost, I was flipped out. I was thinking, "What am I going to buy?" "Sheets?" "Fuck, I need to buy food." I don't believe it's real. I can't realize. Leaving here feels so weird. And I'm scared. I'm scared because... it's the first time I'm starting my life. It's the first time I'll have keys to my place, and be responsible, at 35 years old. I'm super happy. But I'm scared. I'm kind of at war with my mom. I don't see her anymore. It's really dumb that she doesn't get what I've accomplished. I'm really happy for you, Jérémy. I'm super pleased. I know what it means, to have your own place, an apartment. But at the same time, it's a fucking shame you're leaving. Yeah, that's true. She's right. We haven't always gotten along well, we've had a few hassles while we were here. And it's weird, because I'm super sad you're leaving. Every time someone leaves here, we wind up in this terrible state. And, yeah, it sucks that you're leaving. Great job, man. You put in the work. You're good, now, bro, for real. You've got your normal dude degree now. You can wander through the streets, just chilling. No one will say a thing, I swear! Great job, man. And honestly, I don't know if I'll make it, too. For real. I'm a bit anxious right now. I... DAY 43 Fuck, they're such a pain. What's wrong? They're making me write a letter to my grandma. She's not going to read it in her grave. They're playing me. They want to knock me out for the day. Hey. -Hey, everyone. -Hey. You alright? Doesn't seem like it. Keep going. You're almost there. "I miss you." "Dear granny..." "My little granny." -Did you love her dearly? -Yes. Then tell her you love her. What do you want to tell her? That I miss her and I'm sorry for everything. Go on, write that. You've started, now keep going. Tell her everything. You alright, Margot? I'm alright. You going home? Yes. Soaking up some sun? Yes. Those bird songs are wonderful. How can you hear bird songs but not your group's suggestions? Zen, I am the dishes. This rag is soaked. Breathe. Fuck! What's wrong? No one is judging you here, Margot. Calm down. Stop. Excuse me, have you seen Antoine? -They're such a fucking pain. -I need to see him. I haven't seen him. They're such a pain, why can't we watch the game? Why did you push me? I'm talking to you. -They won't let me watch the game. -Fuck the game, don't just push me. -What are you going to do? -Calm down! Why are you talking to me like that? -Don't push me. -All this for soccer? It's not about soccer. She pushed me, I expect an apology. -Don't talk to me like that! -I'll take care of her. I'll handle her. Calm down. -I'm going to hit her, she'll see. -Calm down. Look at what's around you. Why are you mad, seriously? Have you seen where you are? That chick sees I'm pissed about soccer and then lays it on thick. Is it because of Alex? Yeah, she won't shut her trap. But why? I'm trying to understand why she's sulking. I'm mad because there's no game and she won't shut her trap. She doesn't like soccer. Normal people are watching the game now. "Normal people." We're not normal people. This game matters. Now you're huffing. Go to your room if you're tired. Are you feeling better? Yes, much better. That's what I'm getting at. What was I saying? Here we are, live, from the Parc des Princes. The players are coming out onto the field of the Parc des Princes. Can you pass a mic, please? Lisa passes it to Léo, Léo... And he scores! Turn it down a notch. Shhh. Just for a second. You just go to bed. Yeah, quit bothering us. Go to your room. I can't go to my room. It's not time for us to go to our rooms. It's not the time, I can't go to my room. Lisa is going to be replaced in her room. A good decision on her coach's part. I'll give you a T-shirt. Irina, I'd like to confront you about your behavior, lately. Because you're absent. You aren't with us, you aren't with the group. I've just been a bit tired lately, that's all. Each time we confront you, you say the same thing. You just pass us the ball back like that. I don't know how to help you, honestly. Seriously. I feel like you just keep lying. Hang on. No. Dylan, you leave me be, here. OK? Well then, I have to give up. If you don't give a shit about me or us. I don't need you. I think you're wrong. I need you. Irina. Look at me, please. At first, the first time I quit, I thought that what would make me abstain would be having friends, family, a job. But that wasn't true. It's not like that. If you don't recover yourself, it'll never be OK. I could see full well that people who aren't dependent, who don't take anything, had a family and kids. That's not how I operate. I started avoiding conversations with people, not wanting to hear what I was being told. So, I started to self-isolate, and my cravings came back. And one day, sure as rain, I cracked. Literally. I went to see a buddy at the corner store, bought a bottle of whisky, went up to his place, and he gave me some crack. And I relapsed. And I found myself all alone. Because I'd become unbearable with others. There. I've never tried, but maybe you can teach me. Happily. We'd drunk a lot. Well, I'd drunk a lot. I'd drunk a lot of clear liquor: vodka, gin... I was joyful. I was making too much noise. I was dancing and shouting. And I got caught by the cops. They took me to the station and said: "You can get out right now, if you want." "If you suck us off." They'd decided to have a bit of fun with a fag. And so, I see myself, on my knees in that cell, which reeked something awful, sucking off these two guys. What's going on, Margot? It's upsets me, what you're saying, Daniel, because... It awakens this disgust and shame in me... My brother started abusing me when I was seven. At first, it was just cuddles. Just brotherly cuddles. So, I didn't realize right away. I couldn't tell the difference between what was wrong or right. Because I liked it. I felt important and I loved my brother. I realized what had happened when I was maybe 15, 16, when I started having sex with other men, and I started to feel ashamed. My family wasn't doing very well then, so I told myself that if I felt this shame and collapsed and brought it up, everyone would collapse. So, I said nothing. The way I never said "no" to my brother. I felt guilty for never saying no to him. Damn... I would've cut your brother's dick off. Have you called your parents? No. This secret is poisoning you, Margot. So, you're going to choose from the group's members, each member of your family one by one. Irina... You can be my sister. She's disabled. So, she has this constrained body. Maybe draw your legs in a bit. César, you can be my dad. Sit down. It's late. It's been a long day, he's tired. Daniel, will you come be my mom? It's like she's on her way out. And Alex, you come be my brother. You'd be like this, standing up straight. Proud. He's sure of himself. Marion, if you don't mind, you can be me. It should be something reassuring. Maybe put a hand on her shoulder or hold her. And you can open your mouth, like a silent cry. Like you're holding your breath, waiting for it to be over. Alex, can you look at Marion's chest? Well, Margot's chest. Hello? Yes, hello. Yes? It's Margot. You doing well? Fine, fine, you? I'm alright. And you two? I'll call your mom. No, hang on. You're who I want to talk to, Dad. DAY 48 And the chairs upright, please. And the cups, too. Thanks, Margot. Sweeping's done. Thanks. I don't know, 25 in all. Upright, please Guys, Irina took valium and the therapists took her to the station. Fucking hell. Oh, really? I liked her. What's going on? Irian was kicked out. She was taking valium. Fuck. I think it was good we ratted her out. That you ratted her out. You know full well it puts everyone in danger. Wouldn't you have done the same? 14-15 years old, first joints, first drinks, first parties. And an increase in consumption from year to year. -Hello. -Hello. Are you Margot's parents? Take a seat. Hello. We've started the class. Put your flowers down, sir. We're going to try to draw a diagram of a normally functioning family. The Ingalls family, say. If such a family exists. You have the father, mother, daughter, and son. If we imagine that the addict daughter is really starting to cause problems, then she's going to focus all energy, all discussions, all worries on herself. Which means that starting when, let's take the example of Margot, she leaves this place, and comes here to a clinic to recover, the family is going to have to get used to functioning again with this part, no matter how toxic and problematic it is, missing from that place. It seems good, here. Are they treating you well? I'm not in prison, Dad. The food is good. Are you eating well? Don't worry about it. You seem in good shape, anyway. Justine sends her love. How is she doing? You know your sister. She doesn't talk much. Your brother found someone to help us take care of her. He sends his love, too. I'm scared. I'll never manage. Try to be honest with them. Just say what you have to say, I'm sure it'll all be fine. So, this is the last part of family day. The four of us are gathered here to talk. So, Margot is going to speak. I would like... I'd like you to tell you some things that have existed in my life but that I've never told you about. Before I start, I want you to know that I am deeply sorry. There is no excuse for what I did. I started drinking when I was very little. Well, fairly young. You would let us take little sips of liqueurs. You called it "the kid format." Then, I tried joints, to be like the big kids, that lasted until I was about 15. And then I went to the high school you wanted me to go to, Mom. The private school you thought I should go to. But things were worse, there. They had everything. For 3 years, I spent all my weekends getting super high. When I turned 18, I started taking cocaine, amphetamines, and all kinds of meds. I could see the changes on my face. I didn't understand how you could not realize. I was sure I would die young, that I had little time left. That I'd been through it all 1,000 times. I knew how it was going to end. I was scared, but I kept at it. I was so mad at you. Your brother is a doctor, you could've talked to him. Mom, do you remember when you would come wake me in the morning? When I would go to school and you would grumble because Guillaume was still asleep with me? You said it was because I was too scared to be alone at night. I remember, yes. When you were out, Guillaume would slap me when I didn't do what he wanted. He liked it when Justine and I were obedient. At night, he'd come to my room to give me kisses so I'd forgive him. And little by little, he started to undress me. What are you talking about? What are you playing at? I'm not playing. You were children, Margot. Your brother was always there for you. He always supported you. When you weren't home, he would come into the bathroom while I was showering. He would lock the door and come in with me, naked. Do you realize what you're saying? What do you want? It's not your brother's fault you messed up your life. Say something, Dad, please. You're not going to ruin your brother's career over this? Over this? Come on, say something. You've always spoken to people as if they belonged to you. You always need to control things. Dad, Guillaume, Justine. Don't talk to me like that. Try to listen. You can speak after. I was scared. Scared of being judged. -That if you found out... -If we found out what? This is ridiculous. What is ridiculous? All this. This situation makes no sense. Go and get your things, Margot. We're taking you home. Go on, guys. Come on, guys. You coming to play? Got it! Well, yeah, I have a good serve! Look to your right! Yeah, nice!
