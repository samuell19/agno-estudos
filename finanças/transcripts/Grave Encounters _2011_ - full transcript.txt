My name is Jerry Hartfield. I run a video production company, here in Anaheim, California. Um, we focus mainly on reality television shows. If you've ever seen the show, Tornado Trackers, it's one of ours. A tape arrived in the mail. It was a pilot episode of a new reality series called Grave Encounters. And it was by a young producer named Lance Preston. The idea was that him and his group of paranormal investigators, would investigate ghost sightings and hauntings and things of this nature. And this was, you know, years before all the other ghost hunting shows that are out there now. I mean, I really felt he was ahead of his time. My name is Lance Preston. When I was a boy my family moved into a house that I soon discovered was haunted. The things I encountered, have stayed with me forever. Ever since then, I have been obsessed with trying to capture proof that these things were real. Come along with me and my team of skilled paranormal investigators as we dare to venture into some of the most haunted locations known to man. Spending the night, and capturing everything on camera. If you're ready, it's time to have some And everything was... you know, going really smoothly. I mean, the edits that were coming back looked great. We were very excited. We really had something, you know. And then of course, they got to Episode 6. Uh, do you have anything else you want to say? Yeah! I want to be very clear about this. What you're about to see is not a movie. Okay? This is been assembled from some 76 plus hours of raw mini DV source footage that was shot for Lance's show. Not a frame of this had been doctored. It hasn't been manipulated in any way. This is just raw footage, that's been edited strictly for time. Mark! Hello! Hello! Testing! Testing. Lance Preston! Keep a good portion of this in the back the whole time. I'm gonna move a little bit, but... - Are you ready then? - I'm ready. You're still in the shot. I can... I want to get you clean. - One step back. - Okay? Good evening! And welcome to another episode of Grave Encounters. I'm your host, Lance Preston, as always. And tonight I am very excited to take you inside one of the most terrifying locations I've ever seen. Behind me sits the Collingwood Psychiatric hospital. It's one of six buildings spread over 80 acres of land, - just outside ... - You're gonna have to cut, dude. We're gonna have to cut. There's an idiot driving through the shot. We are gonna pick it up from there. I'm not gonna do that beginning part again. Now between the years 1895 and 1960, it played home to more than 80,000 of Maryland's most mentally ill and disturbed individuals. After its closure in 1963, reports of ghostly apparitions, objects moving on their own. And sometimes even the lunatic laughter of the patients condemned to roam these halls. Tonight, my crew and I will be performing an 8 hour lockdown. Trapped inside, during the peak hours of dead time. Using the most sophisticated in ghost hunting equipment we will be in search of what's become known as the ghost of the Collingwood Psychiatric Hospital. - Cut. - Nice! Yeah? - Morgan! - Hi - Morgan Turner! Hi. - Yeah. Hi. - Oop! Perfect. - Thanks for coming out man. I appreciate you making the drive. I know it's a ways. That's okay. I'm really happy to do it. - Is um... is this really going to be on TV? - Yeah, that's what we hope. But not this part. I'm just shooting this. Oh, don't worry about her, she shoots everything. I'm here with Morgan Turner, local town historian. Morgan is here today to shed some light on the institute's dark past. Morgan? Can you tell us when the institute was first built? Well, uh, the history of Collingwood is fairly typical of similar hospitals of the era. It was built in 1893... to address the sort of growing over crowding problem at the State Hospital in Denver's County. Mental illness, of course at that time was not very well understood and treatments were still in their infancy. Psychiatric hospitals like this were seen as sort of a dumping ground for embarrassing family members rather then a place that they could go to actually get help. Right. The conditions were pretty abysmal. People had to sleep on the floor, some times without blankets or even clothes. It was really not a fun place to be stuck in. Could you tell us about Arthur Friedkin? His story is probably the most infamous about this hospital. Sure! I figured that you were gonna ask me that. Friedkin was a Harvard trained neurologist who was Head Physician here from 1937 to 1948. He had gained some notoriety because of his work in experimental brain surgery. He was a major advocate of the lobotomy. Under Friedkin's supervision there were about 140 lobotomies. On August 15, 1948, six patients broke out of their rooms and stabbed Friedkin in his office. His body was found the next morning by a nurse. Unfortunately, this event was completely overshadowed by the death of Babe Ruth, the famous baseball player. It's a crazy story. So Morgan, in your honest opinion. Do you believe in ghosts? Uh... I don't know. But if they do exist, well, this would be a good place to go looking for them. The traffic was a bitch today, so... Didn't take us too long. It was about a six hour drive, something like that. - Oh! - Oh God! "Death awaits." - I guess we'll find out. - That is so lame! Ah, this will take me a bit, this old ancient lock here. I don't even think we should use this. - Looks pretty cheesy, dude. - Yeah! I don't like that. Slow motion, music behind it. Everything's creepy. - Okay... come on. - Good. Here we go. Okay, come on in. Oh my God! So this is the main entrance to the building here. Whoooo! Nice. Yes! Oh, ho ho ho, man! And if you were a... family member, you would check in to reception over there. - Dude, this is creepy as shit! - This is so insane. Are you getting all this? Get everything! I want B camera shots of all of this. Oh, hey, um, no smoking, huh. Can you take that outside? Just don't even light it inside, please. Fire regs. I'm here with Kenny Sandavol, Resident Caretaker, for the past 8 years. Kenny! Would you say that this place is haunted? Well... I've never done this before. So, should I talk to you or to the camera? Yeah... Don't. This isn't... Well, I don't know if I believe in ghost or spirits or nothing like that. But in my time here I've seen some pretty weird stuff. You know, especially working late night you hear all these old pipes and the building sort of make noises and... Well, it's really hard to put your finger on it, but... I get the sense that... I'm not alone. Let's go check it out. - Uh-huh. - Come on. Okay. Uh, it's like these hallways go on forever. Yup! It's hard to believe this place used to house thousands of insane people. There were thousands. Can't believe how dark it is and it's still day time. - Yeah, so what is the power situation? - You scared? Yeah. Oh, there's a few newer lines you can plug into. I'll will show you where those are. But, hey, guys! If you think it's dark now, wait till tonight. 'Cause none of these lights work, it'll get very dark. - So you guys see this window here? - Yeah. I lock it up real good at night, come back in morning, some times this thing's wide open. Whaaaat! Yeah, I can't figure it out. Its like, uh... something's trying to get out or something. It's a definite paranormal hotspot. - Right here is good? - Perfect. All right... boom. And a kitchen over to the right here. How is it supposed to help people if they stuff them in these tiny rooms? Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho! Wow! - Oh my God! - This is officially fucked! - Is this real? - Yup, this is totally real. The guy who lived here was in here for quite a few years and this is what he did. He spent his time writing on the wall. So this was an actual patient that wrote this? An actual patient was in here. Really? I'm not sure whether he was right to the end, but he was here for a long time. Very creepy. - What the fuck!? Kenny! - This is great! - Oh man, the acoustics are shit in here. - Is this real? Supposedly a patient, a young girl, killed herself in here. - What? - Right here? - A patient killed herself, right here? - Yes, slit her wrists in this tub. Oh my God, that's so sad. People say they've heard the sound of rustling water coming out of this room, but I've never heard anything like that. Where are we going next man? Well, we're gonna go down to the service tunnels. Can't wait to see those. Psst! You all right? Whoa, Kenny! This is exactly what I was looking for! It's super dark. These service tunnels connect all the buildings. There's about a quarter mile of them. It's like a maze down here. You could easily get lost. One day, I was down here walking over to the East wing, and the air got real cold. It was so still. It felt like someone was watching me. It was a very eerie feeling. - What? What? - It's just my shadow. Sorry. This is Garry Crawford. Crawford Contracting. He was hired here, quite some time ago, to do some work. Is that right? Back in '93, yeah. The state was gonna try and do some renovations here but eventually they shit-canned the idea. Oh shit, sorry! - You want me not to swear? - Yeah, that would be better. Anyway, um, me and my guys, uh, came in here for about two weeks. And you experienced some supernatural phenomenon? Well, we were off to start, some of the guys were hearing what they thought were weird noises and, uh... And there were some, um, tools disappearing over night, I thought it was looters, but... I never saw anybody, so... - There was an accident? - Yeah... Uh, one of my guys on a ladder, in fact, he was pulling some old wood just-just over there. And he swears that something... pushed him off the ladder. He took a hard fall. Banged up his knee, and, uh, and he quit! Well, that doesn't sound like a "residual haunting." It sounds like an "intelligent haunting." A residual haunting is thought to be like an echo from the past, continuing to loop over and over again. An intelligent haunting is actually a spirit that interacts and has intention. There are many reports of people having been pushed, scratched and even thrown. It's rare, but it does happen. So, you both have spent a lot of time out here? Yeah, all in high school a bunch of the kids used to come down here just to... you know, hang out. And you saw something here? Yes. Uh, we were actually right here. Right here. Uh, making out or whatever... and, uh... I looked up and-and I swear to God, I swear to God, that I saw someone... right at the end of the hall there. - He was wearing, um, was like a white-- - Like a hospital gown. Yeah, like a white hospital gown. And, uh, he had shaved head. Yeah. Full spectral apparition. Why don't we... why don't we grab an interview with the gardener real quick? Can film this with blanks, it doesn't really matter right now. Excuse me! Excuse me sir! Excuse me. I'm shooting a TV show here. Just wondering if you want to do a quick interview with us. I am standing here with the resident gardener, Javier Ortega. Javier, have you ever noticed anything strange around the building? No. Not really. What do you mean? Well, have you heard any weird noises or seen any ghostly activity? I just started working here. "Just started working." That's great. T.C., can you...? Just cut for a sec? Okay, how about you make something up for the camera? Pretend you saw something? Just... - I gotta get go to work! - Okay. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. No, no, no. No, no. Just wait. Do we have any of the- the petty cash left? Yeah, sure. Hey, Javier, how does 20 bucks sound? I am standing here with the resident gardener, Javier Ortega. Javier, have you ever seen anything strange in the past 10 years of working here? Yeah, I saw a ghost. Over here. It was a really scary. A ghost on the exterior of the building. Unbelievable! This is really a paranormal hotspot unlike anything we have ever shot at before. On three, two, one... Because of this location's massive size and scope, I've called in psychic medium Houston Grey to assist in the investigation. Houston! Are you sensing anything? Oh wow! Wow! Oh, there's such an incredible energy here! It's like hundreds of voices all talking at once. The sound is deafening! There's something else. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I... I... There is something else here. It's... like a dark spirit. It might even possibly be a demon. Now we have got to be extremely cautious tonight, Lance. We do not want to be messing with something like this, at all. This is it! Houston, are you feeling anything? Yeah. I'm sensing a deep well of sadness in here. A profound sadness. I see a patient. A female patient. A girl. There's water, red... red water. Blood. Blood. She died right in here. She slit her wrists in the bathtub. The caretaker said a girl killed herself right here. Houston, that's incredible! Her spirit is still with us. Cut it. Yeah! - That was Great! - Okay! Was that too much? No. Come on. How was it guys? No, no, no. That was great. That sounded very real. So Lance! How do you feel about Show 6? Feeling good. It's a good location. Do you think we're actually going to see some ghosts this time? Oh yeah! Hundreds of them. I'm sure. Wow! Maybe try to sound a little less skeptical. I mean, it would be great. But if we don't, then... you know whatever, we just want to make sure we can get some good scares. That's all. Oh! Oh, oh hey, T.C.! Uh, you want to get a nice time lapse shot? Bitch! Dude, the ground's slippery. Window cam, good to go. Yeah! Okay, this is creepy as shit. I am getting out of here. All right, we're about to check in with our resident Grave Encounters tech wizard, Matt. Matt! Why don't you walk us through some of what you're doing here? I've set up ten static cameras at all the hotspots for ghost activity. So they record constantly to tape. They're also recording to a backup hard drive. And everything gets wirelessly transmitted back to my computer. So I'll know what's happening all the time. Real quick Matt! Why don't you walk to us through what some of the equipment is for? This is an E.M.F. meter. And what this does is it records electrostatic and electromagnetic fields in the air. So the basic idea is that man-made or human E.M.F. fields will remain stable. While fields caused by paranormal activity will produce spikes in the reading. Infrared thermometer. Okay, so it's the same idea as the EMF, only it's used to detect drops in air temperature. Ghosts are believed to cause dramatic drop-offs in air temperature, known in the paranormal community as cold spots. Testing one, two, three ... - This is a simple analog audio recorder. - All right. - It's used to capture E.V.P.'s. - Oh, Matt, real quick ... For the audience at home, explain to us what an E.V.P. is... E.V.P. is Electronic Voice Phenomena This thing will actually pick up sounds that the human ear cannot detect. So when we play it back, if we hear something, we'll know that something out there is trying to communicate with us. Okay. This is my favorite. This is a Geiger counter. You just turn this on right here, and you're good to go. I mean, look at this! This is freaking bad ass! Looks bad ass. Listen, I can guarantee you, that if there is anything paranormal, anything freaky happening in this joint, we're gonna catch it. All right folks, we are about to initiate lockdown. My friend Kenny here, the building's care taker will be doing us the honors of sealing us inside. Kenny, thanks very much, man! We'll see you at 6 a.m. Okay, 6 a.m. sharp. Good luck! Put on the night vision. I wanna see this shit. I am a demon. A demon child. I can't wait to see you there in the morning. Yeah, you see, we got to spend the night with these two freaks. What are you doing? I'm on with Kenny. Dude, did you lock the door? What do you mean? It's great for the show, man. Don't worry about it. What if I have to get more equipment out the van? All right! This is the real deal folks! This is the by far the biggest location we have ever investigated and the most dangerous. Now, I want to put emphasis on fact that this facility was built very much like a prison. All the windows are barred. We literally could not get out of here if we wanted to. We are trapped inside, until Kenny the caretaker comes to get us in the morning. We will be working in pitch dark. Capturing everything on three night vision capable cameras. Along with the static cams that Matt set up for us on our hotspots. All right everyone! If you're ready, it's time to have some Grave Encounters! Okay, we are now roaming the vast darkness of the hallways of the institute. Hallways that have been abandoned for more than 50 years. We are in search of spirits that were unsettled in life and possibly unsettled in the afterlife. - I sense down this way. It's cold. - It's cold this way. This is the hallway where the apparition of the patient with the shaved head, was seen floating down at the end of the hallway. Sasha, let's do that E.V.P. Is there somebody with us? Are you a patient here? - Did you use to live in the hospital? - Play it back. "Is there somebody with us?" "Are you a patient here?" "Did you used to live in the hospital?" There's nothing. - All right. One sec... - I feel like it just sort of a... Spirit, you have nothing to fear from us. If you are here, show yourself! I think it's getting colder as we go on. It's drawing us this way. It wants us to go this way. If there's a spirit here with us, we want you to give us a sign. Open the window! Even just a nudge. Shh, Shh, shh, shh. I am going to use this still camera to try to capture paranormal anomalies. They're not usually seen by the human eye. It's better known as spirit photography. One more. We're gonna have to wait for the pictures to be developed. If there is a ghost behind me, we won't know until later. Are you the one who wrote on these walls? What were you trying to communicate? Why don't you try and communicate with me now? If the patient who killed herself in this room, in this very tub, is here now, make yourself known. I am really creeped out in here. All right, I got camera 2 and 4 up. Temperature readings are nominal. Guys, why do I have to be the one that sits here by myself? Houston, do you feel anything? I'm feeling a very, very negative dark energy down here. And not just a single energy, a lot of energy. Many, many spirits. If there are any spirits down here, please show yourself! Make a noise for us. As we've said before, it seems like these tunnels just go on forever. It stinks down here too. - Oh! Did you hear that? - I heard that too. - Shh! Shh! - What? - Okay, we just heard something. - No, for real. What the fuck was that? I know, come here. Come here. Over this way. You guys, follow me. - What the hell is it? Where is it coming from? - I think this door. It's just down over here. You want to open this? You can swing your camera around and get in? Yeah, not really, but... Fuck! Goddamn it! - Oh! - Whoa... yuck! - Oh God. I hate rats! - Are you frigging kidding me? - No way, man! - Really? It's not that big of a deal. Awesome! - You're such a dork! - Houston, it's not funny! This place is as haunted as a sock drawer! It really is scary. I'm honestly scared, okay so... Sitting in a graveyard, and I'm playing a guy whose murdered his wife... Yeah, I wanted to see the concert. I just... I gotta go take a piss. Be right back. Out comes the picture and guess what. There's two of me in the picture. Could this be residual ectoplasmic material discovered first by the Grave Encounters team? Okay, I think we should just do one more walkthrough upstairs. Give me some B camera shots down the hallways, get some of that... floaty hallway stuff. - Arty Shit. - Like we did at Plain View Mansion. - Arty Shit! - Yeah exactly, exactly... Stuff we can cut into. Creepy, creepy, creepy. - Ooh. - Checkers of the dead! King me! What the fuck? Glory hole. Kitchen of the dead. I said cook my dinner, bitch! What the fuck is this? That's about as creepy as it gets. How the fuck we miss this? Lance you are going to love me. Mmm... Shit! How did I guess? Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on... Yes, my dear? Come on. Well if she's crying put her on the phone with me. Hi pumpkin! So what's this Mommy tells me, you're afraid of monsters under the bed? Didn't we have this conversation? Monsters aren't real, baby. They aren't real. And even if they were real, they wouldn't want to come to our house. Because you know Daddy will take care of them for you. Tell Mommy I gave you permission to lay in bed with her tonight. 'Cause Daddy won't be home until morning. We'll go out for pizza tomorrow, okay? Dad will be home soon. Bye bye. Why I even put myself through this... Goddamn! Its cold in here. What the fuck was that! Guys, cut this shit! I'm not fucking playing! Ain't the fucking time to do this shit! What the fuck? Hey! Where are you guys? Maybe it was the wind or something. That's solid, all right. Nothing short of a tornado is gonna move that door. How much do you think that weighs? Hey T.C., how did it move? Was it like...? Whatever it was, it scared the crap out of me, all right? I have to change my shorts when I'm done here. Can you explain it? I... I just told you, man. I was taping, I turned around like this. The thing just closed. And I... - I thought it was you guys, at first, right? - You were taping it? You taped? I told you that in the first place. If you guys weren't so busy like... - Is it you friggin' have it on the tape? - You got it on tape? Check that out! - Whoa! - Oh my God! Okay, that's freaky. Yeah. I accept your apologies. I accept your apologies. I cannot believe that you saw that! The incredible footage you saw just moments ago, was captured by camera man T.C. This door directly behind me slammed on its own. Now there's no drafts in the room, there's no windows that could have caused it to slam on its own. We are now going to attempt to make contact. Houston... Is there someone here with us? Please make a noise. Tap on something. Feel free to slam the door like you did on T.C. just moments ago. Feel free to slam it as hard as you like. So go ahead. Slam it! Right now, please! Give us a sign! Spirit, I invoke you to make an appearance. Take out... With... If there is anyone here, would you please give us a si... Fuck! Fuck! I thought we were actually going to have something here. What the fuck was that? What the fuck was that? Jesus Christ! It was here... That was really fucking scary, guys. That came from right... right here! Shit, I can't see anything. Do you hear that? It's coming from in here. What the hell is that? - What? - Oh shit... Holy shit! What the fuck? Hello? - What the f...? - This is really fucked up guys. - I'm going to... - What the fuck is that guys? - What the fuck is that? - What's up there? Matt. Hey, Matt, is there anybody up on 4? Anybody up on any floor above us? No, what the hell is going on? It's obvious that somebody is fucking around with us. They know we're shooting here. Why are we going up here Lance? - Because this is where the sound came from. - Oh, Jesus Christ. Hello? Is there anybody up here? If someone's here, why are they fucking with us? Listen, if there's anybody here trying to fuck with us, its not funny! All right, we'll call the police! We have a right to be here! We have a permit, and you don't! Hey, can you lower your fucking voice? Would you shut up? I'm trying to talk to them! You guys, you guys quiet. What if this is something real? I'm gonna do EVP. What's your name? What do you want? Are you in the room with us? Where are you? Come on, Sash. Play it back. "What's your name?" "What do you want?" "Are you in the room with us?" "Where are you?" What the hell is that? No, no, no. What is that? What the fuck was that? What the fuck was that? - Did you get that? - Did you see that? - No way! - I got it on tape Sash! Please, please, I don't even fucking care. I just need to go to the lobby! Something just fucking touched me! Something just fucking breathed on me! I need to get out of here. I need to get out of here right now. I can't even deal with this. What are you thinking? - Just wait a second. - Wait for what? Because, look! We have been shooting this show for what? Five episodes? We have never seen anything like that before. I don’t even care right now! I just need to get the fuck out of here! Fine! Houston, you take her down there and you come right back, okay? - I think I'll stay down there as well. - No, no. I need another face on camera. Lance, I am really freaked out, I don't think I can do this. I... Be a fucking professional would you? All right. Stay in character. We are on to something here, all right! Don't do this to me. All right, I'll come back. Come on sweetheart. No no no! T.C., you're with me, man. Come on. Are you kidding me? Did you see that shit? If we get that kind of thing again man! We are fucking making millions! I can't fucking deal with this either! Just moments ago in this very hallway we captured undeniable proof of the paranormal. Sasha was terrified to the bone because a ghost actually manipulated her hair. We're going to try to attempt to make contact now. To the spirit who dwells in this hallway we implore you to show us a sign. Manifest yourself! Please! If you're still with us... give us a sign. Make a noise or... manipulate my hair. Houston, do you see anything? No, I don't. Let me put the light on. No. Nothing. Don't even think of asking to do the same for me. Well, just... we're are a team! You don't have any fucking hair! I think its gone. Yeah, you know, I think, honestly, I think it had its fun... It played this little prank and it took off. Maybe that's all they do... - Yeah, yeah. - I mean, I don't know. Come on! If there's something fucking in here, do something. You did it before, do it again! Are you fucking scared? Jesus Christ. Before I forget... Lance! It's gone ... It's left us ... I'm sensing that it's toying with us. - That it's a more mature-- - Houston, that's enough of that shit! Give it a rest. Can we go home now? Lance, there are people who chase Bigfoot, look for Loch Ness their whole lives. Right. T.C., what time is it? It's 4:40. So let's go home, man. When did that guy say he was coming again? Okay, you guys, I think we have enough footage. Why don't we just pack up everything and we'll get out of here. - Okay! So we are... - Yay... We're going home. I think it's just the right up ahead. Are you sure? Yeah, this is it. This is it. I don't think so. - This is this the way, right? - Oh for the... Look! Fuck. It's a dead end. Guys... Houston, that's not... it's not the right way. - I know. It's another dead end! - Come on, come on! - T.C., roll on this, man. - Roll on what? - Us being lost? - No, we're not lost. We are lost! No! We're not lost. We came this way... Hey, Matt? Hey, Matt, you, uh... Are you at the station? Matt, we're lost in here, man. We need, uh... We need some info. Why the fuck isn't he answering? - I'm not going that way T.C. - Why not?! Because I'm going back over here. Yeah. We... if we stay in the one direction, then we're... gonna get there, okay? It's what? North? In there and around the corner, is where the bathtub was, you know where the girl killed herself. Hey, we've-we've been this way before, we've been this way before T.C. I'm not trying to fight with you. Just explain to me when we saw this tub again. Because this is not the same fucken tub. I know it's not. - T.C., come on get up, man. - You said 6 o'clock? - Are you gonna sleep there? - Is Kenny coming at 6 o'clock? - I'm not waitin'. - Yeah, he's coming at 6 o'clock. - I'm not waiting. I'm not waitin'. I'm not waitin' for you man. - Tired of walkin' in the dark. I'm not waiting. Fuck, where are those guys? - Oh, fuck. Thank God. Look at this. - Holy shit! Where the hell were you guys? You don't hear me calling you on the walkie? - Yeah, you know what? - If we knew, we would've been here. Two tin cans with a fucking string on it would have been better. - We got lost. - Something wrong with your walkie-talkies? 639 00:3i8:26,808 --> 00:38:28,305 No, I was calling you! You didn't hear me on radio? No, I didn't hear shit. You didn't hear me? No! See this is why you don't lock the door, Lance, by the way. Lance! Case and point why you don't lock the fucking door. Holy shit! What did you see? Which one is it? - That... fuck the hair. - Oh, yeah it is. That is fucked! All right, I'm just gonna... I'm gonna dump this quick on the computer. No, no, no, Matt, we don't have time for that. Grab all the static cams. Get it all together. You know what? Guys, let's- let's all get up and start packing this stuff up. Get it ready for when Kenny comes. - Can somebody help me, please? - No, no, no, no. - It'll be much quicker! - I need everybody down here, Matt. I'm sorry man. - It's gonna cut the ti... - I know. - You got your radio? - Yeah, I got it right here. - Sure it works? - Hope so. - Can you hear that? - Yep, you got it. - Okay, I'll Be right back, okay? - All right man. Don't fucking leave without me. Okay, time to get the fuck out of here. Oh, fuck! What the fuck. Hey Lance, are you there, man? Hey guys, I got something up here. Hello? Hey Lance? Hello? Guys, quit fucking around! It is now approaching morning. We haven't seen any activity in well over an hour. For Grave Encounters, I'm Lance Preston. - One more time...? - No, we don't have... One more time. For Grave Encounters, I'm Lance Preston. That's all I got. Fucking, I can't do this anymore... It doesn't really matter, guys. You know why? Cause we can always pick this up tomorrow, there'll be sunlight, we'll get better exposure. - Fine. - You know what I mean? That’s good idea. Where's Matt, anyway? What the fuck is taking him so long? Matt? Matt? Are you there? - Lance! Lance! - Matt? Radio's weren't working before. Guys, I know this sounds really stupid but... I'm the last person who wants to go walking through these halls again. But it's pitch black, and Matt could have fallen and hurt himself for real. She's right, he could be hurt. - You guys, we have to go look for him. - Okay... All right, this is ridiculous, all right? Let's... Let's go fucking look for him. T.C., grab your camera. Sash, grab your camera. For what? Listen, if we gonna go and do this, then we might as well film everything. - Thanks for your help, man. - Hey! It's no fun hanging out here I can tell ya... By myself... Jesus Christ. Matt! - Matt. - Matt! Maaaatt...! - Matt! - Maaaatt! - Matt, where are you, man? - Where the fuck are you? Matt! - What the fuck? - Shit. Matt! Hey Matt! Why is his shit everywhere? Matt! - Fuck! - Matt! Matt! - Matt! - Maaatt! - Fuck! - All right, all right, all right, all right. He wouldn't just leave equipment like this? No, he wouldn't. It looks like he was just packing it up anyway. He's got to be... He's got to be down one of these ways. T.C., you go that way, Sash and I'll go this way Why would we do that? That is a terrible idea. Why? He's got to be here, he wouldn't just leave - Why would we split up? That's a terrible... - his stuff here all right... Sash! Come with me. T.C. just check that way, okay? Matt! Matt, you down here? This looks like the living room after a fight with my girl! Matt, where are you man? I want to go home, this is enough! You're freaking us now! Look for the cigarette butts! Come on, Matt! This is stupid dude! I don't understand this guy. Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy... Whoa! Matt, come on, dude! You're gonna get me in shit with my girl! It's late! The fuck man? You better be dead or dying, bro. Matt! I ain't even playing with you right now! Where the fuck you at? What the fuck?! Matt? Lan-- Lance! Sasha! - Shit! - What happened, what happened? - Don't, don't. - What, what? Don't move me. Just take my arm. Are you serious man? Are you okay? - What? - Just lift me. Just lift me. Just lift me. Just lift me. - I swear to God, someone ... - What? - I got pushed.. - What? Something fucking pushed me, man. I was looking for fucking Matt. I-I was looking downstairs, sort of fucking pushed me, I almost broke my fucking neck, dude. Oh my God. I looked back and there was nothing there. These things have been messing with us, all right, all night. They're getting fucking violent. - Call him! Call Kenny! What are you waiting for? - Okay! Okay! - Told you. Just call him! - Jesus, I'm calling Kenny all right? Jesus Christ. This is fucking stupid. - Are you okay? - No, I'm not okay! Fucking piece of shit. What next...? All right, I can't get a signal. Oh God...! - Let me try. - All right, check your phones, guys. Perfect. Fucking perfect! What the hell are you doing T.C.? What does it look like I'm doing? Come here and fucking help me. - You can't break down the door, T.C.! - Just watch! No, we're gonna cause damage to the property. We're going to be liable for it, all right? Just be patient. Wait! The guys fucking coming. T.C. hey! Come on man! What the fuck! That's coming out of your rate. - Does it look like I give a fuck about the fucking rate?! - No, it doesn't! The fuck are you bothering me for?! I'm tired of this shit! I want to go home. I want to go back to the fucking hotel and get some fucking sleep. Hey, you know what? Your boy there's a no-show, okay? What is he, an hour late? So just put the fucking camera... and fucking help me! - I'll pay for the damages! For fuck's sake! - Fine. All right. - Jesus Christ. - Help me! All right. All right! - Do you, do you want my help? - No, Houston, we're fine with you there. Fuck, goddamn it. - On three, okay? - Yeah. One... two... three... Fuck you... - Are you even pushing? - Yeah, I'm pushing. One... two... three! What the hell? No, this is the fucking lobby. This is the fucking lobby, dude. - We came in this way, right? - Hell, yeah! Yeah, this is the... this is the lobby, yeah. This can't be right. This is impossible. This is the way we... this is where we put our shit, right? Yeah. This is the way we... this is how we brought the stuff in. - This doesn't make sense, right? - I don't understand this shit... This doesn't make any sense... This is the way we came in. It's just another hallway, it doesn't... I don't know ... We must have got turned around in here. We must be on the other side of the building or something. Lance. Lance. Are those are same doors? I'm getting sick of this, guys. Oh, ho, ho, ho, yes! Here, you want me to take it? Houston, take that. Take that, please. Hey, hey, watch your leg, man. Watch your leg! Give me a fucking hand, you just sitting there watching. It's not a fucking spectator sport! All right, all right, all right. What the fuck is wrong with you? Okay, on three. One... two... three! Fuck! What--What does that fucking say?! What the fuck is going on? Maybe it's just an exit down to... like this way to the emergency exit. Houston, shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. This! See? Now we'll get out. Now this is a man's fucking job. - Come on. Pull on it. - Got it? - Come on! - Come on! Give me a fucking second? - Oh fuck! - Hey, watch it. Watch yourself. - We're fucking trapped in here, man! - No, we're not. Hey, let's get a tool. We can try pry the bars out. I, oh, I got a fucking tool belt. Oh, shit, I forgot... - It's in the van. Outside! - Oh, fuck! - You know, how we're locked out? - We got nothing? Fucking brilliant idea. All right, obviously not all the fucking windows have bars on them. Yeah, they do. No, no! The one upstairs! That one didn’t have any bars on it! Right? We just got to find it. That window is a shear drop 80 fucking feet! - Come on. - What time is it, Sasha? - 8:34. - You got to be fucking kidding. - Fuck! - I told you I had that fucking other gig at 8:34?! I have an audition tomorrow! No one cares about you and your queer inside the ... the faggot studio shit! - Oh! My work's not as important as yours? - Guys, let me think for a second! This doesn’t make any sense. This is fucked up! I checked the sunrise times last night. What's your fucking point? It should've been bright by 7:45. It's still night out. - The sun is still not up... - Doesn't make any sense! It's not fucking funny, man. Shut up! This don't make no sense. - I need to get out of this fucking building! Please! - Somebody help us! Okay, okay, okay, okay. Here. Listen, listen. Well, let's just try to be rational here, okay? This is an old building, right? It's an old building, so it has all sorts of energy fields, things and stuff going on, either could be electric anomaly, that has actually moved our clocks faster, or something so that you know, it's actually not really 8:30 but only 6:30. That would explain why it's still dark out. And why-why... you know, Kenny hasn't shown up. - Electrical anomaly? - That's fucking retarded! Why don't you come up with... If you're gonna fucking come up with an idea come up with something rational! This isn't one of your fucking auditions for some science fiction movie! There's nothing else that's rational here okay? It's as rational as anything else. I checked my cell phone... And... it says the time is 1:12. It's 1:12 p.m. I don't... I don’t think that's right. But I guess it cant be... right? I don't know. Everyone's very tired. So they're just, uh... They're taking a nap. They're taking a break. And we're going to just wait until Kenny shows up. I don't know where the hell he's gonna meet us. Doesn't makes any sense. I haven't slept in like 20 hours. I'm gonna... I'm just gonna set my alarm for an hour and I'll take a nap. - What the fuck? - What's that? - Jesus Christ! - Houston, what's your problem? - What're you talkin'... my problem?! - What the hell are you doing? - What the hell happened? - Oh my God! All right, uh... someone or something just broke our lights. So we're in the pitch dark. All we have is our flashlights and our camera lights. - Which you're wasting right now. - I just checked my cell phone. And it says it's 8:00 p.m. So, we slept for 7 hours. T.C. went to get a sandwich and you've gotta see this. Lance! It stinks... Close that shit. Hey! What are you...? Close the... Close the fucking thing man! All the food is like that, but we still have lots of bottled water so... I don't know, we should... we should be okay. All right wh-Why don't we try going down through the tunnels? Okay? Kenny said that the tunnels connect all the buildings together, then maybe we can find a way out through one of the other buildings. Are you looking and see the Great Wall of China? I'm not going for no goddamn tunnels. If our lights go out, we're fucked. Hey, listen. Remember when you told me to do the time lapse outside. - Mm-hm. - I saw a fire escape. Now if we get on the roof, could probably climb down that and get the fuck out. Well. What's the verdict? Are we staying here or-- Look, I don't care what we do. Let's just get the fuck out of here! I'm really... I don't want to be here anymore. Okay, okay. So everybody, we're gonna do this? Everybody wants to do this? - With the roof? - All right, fine! - Let's pack up all the gear and let's go. - Let's go. - Give me some light, guys. Come on. - Here, here, here. Sorry. - Do we go there? - Which way? - Lance? - No, no, no! T.C., you knew where we were going, you said... I didn't say anything. Don't put it on me. No, you said you know where the ladder was. No, I said there was a ladder. - I didn't tell you where. - Okay. But is it this end? It doesn't matter. Was it over here? - I saw from the outside. - Okay. Got just a...? I can't do this, guys. - Look! - What the fuck is that? - Hello! Someone up here? - We just keep on... T.C., is this it? Don't ask me questions. Is it a staircase or not? Hey listen, just keep the light on in front of me. Move, move, move! Get the fuck out my way! Get the fuck out of my way! - Wait guys! - T.C., slow Down. What the fuck, you guys? Yes, yes. The fuck, yeah! No fucking way! Fuck. Take this. Take this. That can't be right. It's fucking solid. Does it look new? Does it look like it's been there for a while? This doesn't make any sense. Fuck! Would you get the fucking camera out of my face! - What do you think? - I don't know, I don't know. Okay. We just left the stairwell... We just... we just left the stairwell that was completely sealed up at the top. - I going to document everything... - What the fuck?! because when we get out of this place, people are gonna want to see this. Shhh! Look at this! Okay we came up four flights of stairs, right? That puts us on the 4th floor. We came from this way, and we've gone at least to here, right? - Are you guessing? - I don't know ... - T.C., is it one of these floors-- What, what, what? - What are these? You are here? - Yeah, but we know we went up four stairs! It's not changed. This has not opened. This has not been changed. This says we're on the 1st floor. But keep in mind though. - Initially, this was where we came in, right? - I know, I know, but... - T.C., are you filming this? - Yeah, I'm getting this. That's fucked up. - Goddammit. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What-what-what? What the fuck is that? Do you hear that? - Did you guys hear that? - Holy shit! What is that? - Shit! Stop. - Matt? Matt? Holy shit! Over here. Down this way! Over here. - Matt! - Matt! Matt! Matt! Matt! Matt, you in here? - Matt! - Matt! - Guys! Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Matt He's fucking... He's not in here. He's not in here! Whoa whoa whoa! That just fucking move?! Let's get out of here! We uh... We wandered the building today looking for another stairwell. And... I don't know. We couldn't find one. This building's a fucking maze! It's like T.C. said it's... It's like it just keeps changing all around us. We still haven't been able to find Matt. I don't even know if he's okay. Just hope he's not seeing that same shit we are. We're uh... We're all tired, and we're hungry. So we're gonna try to sleep again. We're going to sleep in shifts this time so somebody can always be on watch. - T.C., you're rolling man? - Yeah. We just woke up and you guys got to see this! Turn the fucking camera off! Sasha! Come on. We gotta to document this okay. - I'm sorry. People got to see this. - No, no! - Careful! Careful! - I'm so sorry. Sasha, we got to tape this down. This is unheard of. There is no way someone came in here and did that without us noticing. - Dude cut it! Cut this. - My pleasure. Matt! I swear to God I heard him. Matt! Hello? Matt? See? There, there. I fucking heard him, I told you guys. He's alive! Matt! Are you okay? Can you hear me? I'm freezing cold! Just tell us where you are. We'll come get you. Matt! Shit! He's not there anymore. We have to find him. How are we gonna find him? We can't even find our way to the front door! Well, Houston, he can't be far. Those walkie-talkies are a piece of shit. Listen, how do we even know its him? Matt! Are you in here? - Sorry, sorry, sorry! - Fuck! Matt! We heard you buddy! Where are you? Matt? Sash, try all the frequencies. It doesn't have that much range. How far did you say you thought it was? I don't know how far, the specifications... - So what if you guess? What, like 200, 300, 400? - 300... 200 yards to get a clear signal! Maybe 300... before it starts crapping out. Okay. Stay together, come on. That's a dead end! Dead end. - Matt! - Hey Matt! - Matt. - Matt! Where the fuck are you? Just check everywhere. - Hey. Matt. - Matt! Listen guys. This is fucking pointless, all right? If we were to find it, he would... the range of the walkie talkies... Holy shit! - What was that? - That was Matt! - Matt! - Matt! Where are you going, man? Where the fuck you been dude? Lance! Lance! Lance... Holy shit! Holy fuck! Do fucking something! Lance! Lance! Hey... Hey. Who are you? How come you're... How come you're in here? Turn the light off! turn the light off! Did you see her fucking face? Fucking shut the fuck up! Did you see her fucking face? What's happening here? Why is this happening? Oh my God! Oh shit! Oh shit! Shit, we lost him! Oh shit, we fucking lost Houston! We fucking lost Houston! Lance? Guys! Lance? Sasha! Sasha! T.C.! Lance! Sasha? T.C.? Is anybody here? T.C.! Help! Help! Help! Please! We've been hiding in this room for a couple hours. Houston's gone. Then we tried Matt on radio but... I hope they're both okay. What the fuck is that? We keep hearing crazy shit like that all around us. Fuck! I don't know how much longer we're gonna last. We're not alone in here anymore. It has my fucking name on it. How the fuck does it have my fucking name on it? First, I get scratches on my back and now ... What the fuck! Okay, we woke up and we had these on our wrists. You gotta see this... Fuck you. The fuck? Why'd you fucking fall asleep? You fucking asshole! - I didn't fucking mean to, okay? - You fucking fell asleep! - I didn't fucking mean to. - You made this happen, you asshole. What the fuck does this mean? It means we're fucked. Okay! That's what it fucking means. This is insane. This is fucking insane! - Don't look in it! - Why is all of them like this? Jesus Christ! What the fuck? No, man! There's something over there. Okay! Enough is enough! We keep walking in what feels like circles and, uh... uh... And we, uh... we still can't find Matt and, uh, Houston. - Would you stop! - What do you mean? Stop what? Are you kidding me? Fucking host shit, we're not making a - fucking TV show. - I'm just, I'm just documenting stuff, okay? People are gonna want to see this. Matt and Houston are gone. We need to concentrate on getting out of here and finding them. And you just keep doing this host shit! Okay you guys, just stay together, okay? - I'm just really... - Don't worry about it. Get the fuck outta here! - Is that the fastest you guys can run? - Let's go! What the fuck is wrong with you guys! Jesus Christ! Come on! Keep up! No, no, no, no! Get up! Are you out of your fucking mind? - Get up! Get up! - Come on! - I can't, I can't! - Yes, you can. Come on, you got to get up. You got to get up. Come on. I know! I know! You gotta pick yourself up. You got to do this, okay? You got to get up. We got to keep going! Holy shit! What, what? I found something. Just get... Just get over here! What the fuck are you waiting for? Come in! Look! - Oh shit! Shit, Matt? - That's him, right? I don't know, man. Matt! Hey! Matt, get up! Matt, Matt! You guys check the fucking room! Hey, Matt? Yo, dude! - Hey, hey, hey. Stop fucking around! - Matt, are you okay? - Oh, fuck! - Oh, shit! The patient exhibits acute compulsive disorder linked to childhood phobia. Jesus Christ! - Just get him the fuck... Get him the fuck up! - Let's go! Let's go! Go! Come on, get him up! Pull him over and let's get the fuck out of that bitch's bath. Let's go! Let's go! Let's... Get him in here. Come on. Put him down on the bed, put him down there. - You see anything? - No, its good. Hey! Where you been man? Where'd you get those clothes? - Well, for God's sakes, talk to us! - You guys, look at his wrist. Matt? Matt? Matt? Where'd you get this... Where'd you get all this shit from? Matt? Matt? What did they do to you? What did you see? Enough of this bullshit! Look, I don't know where you been but you probably know a way out of here. You got to know a way out of here. Of course there's a way out. We can all leave... as soon as we're better. What? What do you mean, "when we're better"? What the fuck does that mean? But I... I wasn't ready yet. Progress is slow. But the patient is responding to treatment. This guy's out of his mind. He's like high or something. He's talking all crazy... - T.C.! Shut up! - You don't tell me to shut up. He's fucking... Fuck! Don't be sad. Everything's gonna be okay. He'll help you too. Oh my God! - Okay, okay, T.C.! Check that door! - I already did. - Just check it! - I'm not fucking... If somethings getting in here man... Just make sure there's nothing in here! We found Matt. He's all fucked up. We still got T.C. here. What? - It's okay. - What are you doing? I don't feel good. I think there's something wrong with me. Yeah, you feel really warm. I think you got a fever. - Here. Have a sip. - Thank you. - Get some sleep. - I can't sleep. I don't think I'll ever be able to sleep again. What the...? Jesus! Come on! Come on! Come on! Run! Run! Go, get in there! Give me your hand! - Can you see anything? - What? There's blood in the tub! There's blood in the tub! - What? - Let's go! Go where?! Fuck. - Get the fuck outta here. Let's go. - Fuck! Get the fuc...! Matt? Matt! - The hell is he doing? - T.C., get him away from the tub! Come on Matt! T.C., what the hell is he doing? I don't fucking know! Oh my God! Oh my God! Help me! Help me! Flip the tub! Jesus! - T.C.'s gone! - He's gone! He's fucking gone! He just disappeared! It's like he vanished. Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus! Oh, fuck! No, no! It's okay. It's okay. Oh, oh, oh. Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Look! It is an elevator! Open it! Open it! Open it! Open it! Okay. It's an elevator shaft. If we can get down to the tunnels, we could use them to get one of the other buildings. Come on! Fuck, fuck! Okay, listen! Listen to me. I'm gonna need you to stay here with Matt, okay. I'm gonna get something to pry this door open with and then we're gonna get out of here, okay? Stay here with him. Okay? Jesus Christ. Oh Jesus. Okay. What the hell is that? Jesus! Is that a tongue? Oh fuck! What's wrong? What's wrong? - Bring the light, bring it here. - Stay there. There's a ladder right there. We can use it. We can use the ladder to get down. How are we going to get Matt? I'm going to reach across, and then you hand me Matt, okay? Stay back there! Stay back! Lance! Lance! Lance! Lance! Where the hell's the night vision button? There it is! Lance! He's gone? I don't know, he just disappeared. Go on. Go on. He might come back. Go on. - Where the hell is he? - Matt? Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus! He jumped! He jumped! Holy shit! Come on. Almost there. Come on! Easy. Easy. I got you. You're okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's the tunnels. We made it to the tunnels. Come on. I can't. I can't leave him. Come on, Sash! Get out of there. Remember what Kenny said. They connect the buildings, all right? I need you to do this with me. - Can't do this alone! Okay? - Okay. You stay close to me. Let's go this way. It can't be too far. Okay, we got it. Come on, we gotta be close. No! We should've hit a... We should've hit a junction by now. It should have been right around here! What the fuck?! I can't keep doing this. Wait a second! Sash, are you okay? What's wrong? Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus! I want my mom! It's a... It's day uh... Fuck, it's day... It's day... It's day... I don't even know what day it is anymore. We spent all day walking in one direction and... we didn't get anywhere. My feet are killing me and I'm hungry. Sasha's not gonna make it. She can't keep up. Who's there? Who is that? Sasha? Sasha! Sash! Sash! Sasha! Where are you?! Where are you?! Sash! Sash! Sash! Sasha! Come on! Shit! Dammit! What do you want from me? "What do you want from me?" I'm running low on battery power. I only turn on light on when I need to, now. But I don't really need the light anymore! I just keep walking straight. I can walk in the dark for hours. It's kinda like a game. How long can you go? Anybody watching... Fuck you. Fuck you! Fuck you, guys! This was for you. No demons in these walls! Not in here! Not in here with me! Not in here with me! Come and get me! I just woke up and... I don't know how long I was sleeping but... There's a door! You gotta see it! This isn't happening. This isn't happening. I've lost my fucking mind. Jesus! Jesus Christ! What is all this? It's impossible! Shit! Shit! No! No! I'm not crazy! I'm not crazy! No! No! No! He said I'm all better now. I can finally go home. For Grave Encounters... I'm Lance Preston. Signing off!
