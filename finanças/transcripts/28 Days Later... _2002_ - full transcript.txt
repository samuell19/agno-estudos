Bingo! Fucking hell. Fucking hell. Oh, God... Keep your shit together. If you wanna get them out of here. I can pop these, no problem. So get to it! Security, we have a break-in. Get the... I know who you are. I know what you think... If you don't wanna get hurt, keep your mouth shut and don't move a fucking muscle. The chimps are infected! They're. They're highly contagious. They've been given an inhibitor. Infected with what? In order to cure, you must first understand. Infected with what? Rage. What the fuck he is talking about? Get the cages open. No! No! No! Listen you sick bastard, we're going and we're taking your torture victims with us. No. We're gonna get you out of here. The animals are contagious. The infection is in their blood and saliva. One bite... Stop. Stop! You've no idea! Get it off! Help me! Get it off! Get it off! What's the matter with her? You have to kill her! Oh, my God! What's the matter with her? We have to kill her now! Oh, God... Hello? Hello? Hello! Hello? Hello! Hello? Hello? Father? Father, are you okay? Oh, shouldn't have done that. Shouldn't have done that. Shit! Over here! Over here! Come on! Go, go, go! Keep going! What the fuck is going on? Just shut up! Covered everything. Who are those people? Let's go! Let's move! Please, tell me what the fuck is going on? Just move! Come on! Man walks into a bar with a giraffe. They each get pissed. The giraffe falls over. The man goes to leave and the barman says "Oi!" "You can't leave that lying there." He says "No, it's not a lion. It's a giraffe." He's completely humourless. You two should get on like a house on fire. So who are you? You're from the hospital, yeah? Are you a doctor? He's not a doctor. He's a patient. I'm a bicycle courier. I was riding a package from, Farringdon to Shaftesbury Avenue and a car cut across me. Then I wake up today in hospital. I wake up and I'm... I'm hallucinating or I'm... What's your name? Jim. I'm Mark. This is Selena. Okay, Jim. I've got some bad news. It started as rioting, and right from the beginning you knew this was different. Because it was happening in small villages, market towns. And then it wasn't on the TV any more. It was in the street outside. It was coming through your windows. It was a virus. An infection. You didn't need a doctor to tell you that. It was the blood. There was something in the blood. By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late. The infection was everywhere. The army blockades were overrun. And that's when the exodus started. The day before the TV and radio stopped broadcasting, there were reports of infection in Paris and New York. We didn't hear anything more after that. What about the government, what are they doing? There's no government. Of course there's a government! There's always a government. They're in a bunker or a plane... No, there's no government, no police, no army. No TV, no radio, no electricity. You're the first uninfected person we've seen in six days. Where's your family? They're dead. Like Selena's. Yours will be dead too. Look, I have to find them. They live in Deptford. I can walk it. Okay? You'll go and come back, yeah? What's the fuck... Fuck! You won't. Yes! No one ever comes back. So lesson one. You never go anywhere alone unless you've got no choice. Lesson two. Only travel during daylight. Unless you've got no choice. We'll take you tomorrow. We'll all go and find your dead parents together, okay? Eat. If you want her to slow down, you'll have to say. If there's anyone... I understand. Anyone... I understand! Okay. Jim... Wait! They died peacefully. You should be grateful. I'm not grateful. My... parents and my sisters, we went to Paddington Station, hoping maybe we could get on a plane, maybe we could... buy our way onto a plane. I remember my dad had all this cash, even though cash was completely useless. About 20,000 other people had the same idea. Crowd was surging. I lost my grip on my sister's hand. I remember the ground was soft. I looked down and I was standing on all these people. Like a carpet. People who had fallen and... Somewhere in the crowd there were infected. It spread fast. No one could run. All you could do was climb. Climb over more people. So I did that, I climbed. And I got up on top of this kiosk. Looking down, you couldn't tell which faces were infected and which weren't. Then I saw my dad. Not my mum or my sister. My dad. His face... Selena's right. You should be grateful. We don't have time to get back to the shop before dark. We should stay here tonight. My room's up at the top. You two can have that. No, we'll all sleep in the same room. It's safer. Jim. Oh, you're back? Yeah. How was it? Fine. Give me a drink of that, will ya? It's empty. Ha! Here. Right. I'll start working on them, then. Mark! Mark! Selena! Help! It's clear. That's Mr Bridges. Were you bitten? And his daughter. From four doors down. Were you bitten? No. Did any of the blood get in your mouth? No. Mark? Wait... Get that cleaned off. Do you have any clothes here? I... I... Yes. Then get them and get dressed. We have to leave now. More infected will be coming. They always do. How did you know? How did you know he was infected? The blood. Yeah, but there was blood everywhere, It was on me, it was on you. I didn't know he was infected, okay? He knew. I could see it in his face. Look, if someone gets infected, you've got between ten and twenty seconds to kill them. It might be your brother, or your sister or your oldest friend. It makes no difference. Just so you know where you stand, if it happens to you, I'll do it in a heartbeat. He was full of plans. Have you got any plans, Jim? Do you want us to find a cure and save the world or just fall in love and fuck? Plans are pointless. Staying alive's as good as it gets. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What's that? Let's go. What is it about tower blocks and shopping trolleys, huh? Stop talking, it's a long way up. Do you need a break? You? No. Now I do need a break, by the way... What's up? Nothing. I got a headache. Bad? Yeah, it's pretty bad. Well, why didn't you say something before? Well, because I didn't think you'd give a shit. You've got no fat on you and all you've had to eat is sugar. So you're crashing. Unfortunately, there isn't a lot we can do about that except pump you full of painkillers and give you more sugar. As for sugar, Pepsi or Lilt? Do you have any Tango? Actually, I did have a can of Tango somewhere. Quiet! That's an infected. Oh no, they're in. Move! Wait up, Selena! Wait for me, please! Please, Selena! Please! Wait for me! Come on! Run! Wait! Please! For fuck's sake! Selena! Down the corridor. Flat 157. Move! Thank you. Thank you. Open the door! Open the door! Open up! Where's Dad? What? Open the fucking door! Where's Dad? Let them in, Hannah. Let them inside. Go in. Go in! So, I'm Frank, anyway. Jim. Selena. Selena. Good to meet you. This is my daughter Hannah. Come on, sweetheart. Say hello. Come on. So... This is great. Just great. Calls for a celebration, I'd say. Why don't you all sit down and... Hannah, what've we got what've we got to offer? We've got Mum's creme de menthe. Great. Creme de menthe. Oh, yeah. Look, sit, please. Get comfortable. Where are the bloody glasses? Middle cupboard. Nah, the good ones. It's a celebration. Top cupboard. So, this is your place? It's nice. There. I know it isn't much but, well, cheers. Cheers. You okay in there, Jim? Yeah. Sorry we couldn't spare the water. Same with the toilet. The flush doesn't work. You'll have to use the bucket. Have to empty it each morning, you know. Just chuck it over the balcony. No mod cons here. It's fine. Yeah, all right. Listen, it's late. We're gonna turn in. We have a spare room. In there. Are you and Selena... No. No, no, no. I'll take the living room. It's fine. Right. No, I mean, yeah. So... Goodnight, then. Yeah. Goodnight, Frank. Very spruce. Very shredded. Yeah. So what do you make of them? Well, they're desperate. Probably need us more than we need them. I think they're good people. Good people? Yeah. Well, that's nice, but you should be more concerned about whether they're gonna slow you down. Right, because if they slowed you down... I'd leave them behind. In a heartbeat. Yeah. I wouldn't. Then you're gonna wind up getting yourself killed. I'm gonna get some sleep. Selena... You think I don't get it, but... I do get it. And I know I'd be dead already if I hadn't met you. Sure. No, look... I mean, thank you. And I mean, sure. Goodnight, Jim. Goodnight. We lost water pressure three weeks ago. For while I thought we'd be okay with the water from the other flats. Cisterns and tanks. But it vanishes so quick you wouldn't believe. You drink it, it evaporates, turns stagnant. They're all empty. Hasn't rained in ten days. You can set up a plastic sheet to catch dew and condensation, trap it somehow... Saw it on TV once, but I can't make it work. You'd never think it. Needing rain so badly. Not in fucking England! Jim, we're not gonna be able to stay here. There haven't been any broadcasts for weeks. Just listen. Salvation is here. The answer to infection is here. If you can hear this, you're not alone. There are others like you... There are other survivors. We are soldiers and we are armed. Oh, my God. Soldiers. Quiet. There's more. Our location is the 42nd blockade, M602, 27 miles north-east of Manchester. You must find us. Salvation is... Now it just repeats. Why, 'cause it's a recording? Yeah, it's a recording. But this is where it's telling us to go. Just there. The way things are, we might need two or three days to get up there. We? Sound carries in this flat, you know, jerry-built I suppose. Me and Hannah do need you more than you need us. Look, I didn't... No, it's okay. It's the truth. I can't leave the block if it's just the two of us. Something might happen to me. Hannah'd be alone. I couldn't risk it. But with other people... If it's a recording, for all we know, the soldiers who made it are dead. It's possible, yeah... And that stuff about the answer to infection I mean, there is no answer to infection! It's already done pretty much all the damage it can! Maybe they have a cure. Maybe they've got nothing at all! The only way to find out is to reach them. We could die trying, Frank! Or die here. And anyway, it isn't true what Dad said. You need us, just the same as we need you. We need each other. And we'll never be safe in the cities. The soldiers could keep us safe. So we have to try and get there. Get there how? Just so you know, I don't take cheques or credit cards. What do you think? Well, it's the most direct route to the other side of the river. No, no, no. Then we should take the indirect route. The one it's in broad daylight and it's not underground. Let's just get it done. No, no. No. See, see, this is a really shit idea. You know why? Because it's really obviously a shit idea. So we're just gonna drive into the tunnel full of fucking smashed cars and... It's really fucking obviously a shit idea! Hold on! Dad! Fuck! The world's worst place to get a flat, huh? Agreed. I think we'd better do this quick. I've got the wheel. You're on the jack. Do you hear that? Hey, hey, do you hear that? Hear what? Right, I've done it. Dad? Jesus Christ! Oh. No! Fucking rats! Get off! Come on. Hannah! They're running from the infected. Move it! The jack, Hannah. No time. Forget the jack. Just lift, everyone. Grab hold! One, two, three, lift! Lift, lift! Don't look at them! Don't look! I can see them! They're coming! Come on, Hannah! Almost. Get the tyre on, Hannah! I'm trying. Get the tyre on. Come on. Three, two, one, drop it! Get in the car! Come on! Frank, drive! Move it, Frank! Goodbye, you fuckers! Hey, Frank, Frank, stop the cab. Let's shop. You... You... You... Anybody seen any buns? Irradiated. Don't take anything that needs to be cooked, okay? I think you can eat that raw. Decaffeinated coffee, tea... Put that back. Can't just take any crap. If I never see another chocolate bar again, it'll be too soon. Not counting Terry's Chocolate Orange! Now, single malt, 16 year old, dark, full flavour. Warm but not aggressive. Peaty after-taste. Takes out the fire but leaves in the warmth. Either we do this now or we're walking. Not you. Stay close, Jim. What? You heard. Where are you going? We've got enough food, Jim. We don't have any cheeseburgers. Like going on holidays with your fucking aunt! Oh, Jesus. Hello? I hate you! Find anything? Find anything, Jim? No! Let's get outta here. Okay, we're done here. Okay, Hannah. Easy. Brake! Brake, brake! Out. Oh my God! I wanna like, taste the vitamin C. The raisins. The raisins are so moist. What did you say? The raisins. They're so moist. Look over here. Like a family. Do you think they're infected? No. They're doing just fine. Come on. Let's eat! Let's eat! Know what I was thinking? You were thinking that you'll never hear another piece of original music ever again. You'll never read a book that hasn't already been written, or see a film that hasn't already been shot. That's what you were thinking. No. I was thinking I was wrong. About what? All the death. All this shit. It doesn't really mean anything to Frank and Hannah because... she's got her dad and he's got his daughter, so... Cheeky monkey! I was wrong when I said staying alive is as good as it gets. See, that's what I was thinking. Was it? You stole my thought. Sorry. That's okay. You can keep it. It's getting late. I think we'd better stay here for the night. I can't sleep. Me neither. Doesn't feel safe, does it? Outside like this. I think we're safe enough. Selena didn't seem to have any trouble. Yeah, I noticed that. Hey, Selena. What? What is it? How'd you get to sleep? Bloody hell. Must've needed a hell of a prescription for that lot. I didn't need a prescription. I qualified as a chemist. Oh, great. Valium. Not only will we be able to get to sleep, but if we're attacked in the middle of the night, we won't even care. Two each. Not for me, thanks. Can I, Dad? I don't think so, sweetheart. Please? No. I can't sleep. Come on, Frank. Let her live a little. Give her half of one. All right. We're on. Night-night. You're a big softie, Frank. Frank? Hannah? Frank? Hello? Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! You're having a bad dream, that's all. Thanks, Dad. Come on, sleepyhead. Come on, Babe Ruth. Hurry up. Oh, no. Did I miss breakfast? You'll sleep through anything, you. Did you have a fry-up? We'll stop at a pub on the way. Door! Our location is the 42nd blockade, the M602, 27 miles north-east of Manchester. You must find us. Please! Salvation is here. The answer to infection is here. Must be Manchester. The whole of Manchester, the whole city. No fire crews to put it out. 42nd blockade. This is it. I don't understand, Dad. Did they leave? I don't like this. I think we should go. No! The vehicles. We should check the vehicles first. There has to be something Nothing. I can't believe it. Frank. Frank! We have to go. Yeah. Go fucking where? Get out of it. Get out of it! Dad, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine, sweetheart. Sorry I lost my temper. Hannah. I love you very much. What? Keep away from me. Stay where you are. Dad? Keep away from me! Dad? Keep away from me! Keep away! Keep away! Keep away! Keep away! Dad! Keep away! Keep away! Dad! What's wrong? Dad! Jim! Jim, he's infected! No! Now, Jim! Now! Jim, kill him! Jim! Dad! Kill him! Stay away from him! Keep away from the body! Dad? Three survivors. One male, two female. I repeat, one male, two female. ETA, 15. Put the kettle on. I'm Major Henry West. Welcome. Jim. Hello, Jim. Hello. Well, we've got beds with clean sheets and a boiler that produces hot water. So you can all have a shower. You look like you need one. Please. It ain't funny. I got loads of cooking to do, you fucking Doris! Run him over! How is she doing? Well, she's lost her dad, Jim. That's how she is. It's all fucked. What do you mean? Oh, don't do that, don't do that. Come on, come on, come on. Hey, don't do that. Look, Hannah is what Frank says she is, okay? She is... She is tough and she is strong and she'll cope just like I'll cope. Just like you'll cope. I don't want her to have to fucking cope. I want her to be okay. When Hannah had her dad it was okay. It was okay for them and it was okay for us. Now it's all just fucked. So you heard our broadcast? Yeah, we did. We must be a disappointment. You were hoping for a full brigade. An army base with helicopters and a field hospital. We were just hoping for... The answer to infection. Yeah. Well, as I said before, it's here. Though it may not be quite what you imagined. Just feel very lucky to have found you. You were lucky. The fire drove hundreds of infected out of Manchester. The surrounding area's teeming with them. But don't worry. You're quite safe here. Flat terrain all round the house. Floodlights which we've rigged up to a generator. High perimeter wall which helps. And we've been lacing the ground with tripwires and land mines. You wouldn't want to mow the lawn, but if they get in, we hear them. Secondary to protection, our real job is to rebuild. Start again. The belly of the house. The heart. A wood-fired boiler providing us with hot water. The first step towards civilisation. The kitchen. Wait, wait, don't be throwing it. No. Don't be fighting. Will you put that back? Put it back. Well, Jones, our resident tin opener. What are you cooking, Jones? Surprise, Sir. I can't wait. And lastly, meet Mailer. Mailer, Jim. Jim, Mailer. Got infected two days ago. Mitchell managed to knock him out cold and we got a chain round his neck. Keeping him alive? The idea was to learn something about infection. Have him teach me. And has he? In a way. He's telling me he'll never bake bread. Farm crops, raise livestock. He's telling me he's futureless. And eventually he'll tell me how long the infected take to starve to death. ♪ You'll have to wait and see ♪ ♪ Hope it's chips, it's chips ♪ ♪ We hope it's chips, it's chips ♪ Hat. So, what have we here? Tinned ham, tinned peas, tinned beans and... Nice one, Doris! Omelette! You prepared a feast, Jones. Honour of our guests, Sir. Absolutely. I was going to propose a toast, but this omelette will do just as well. To new friends. To new friends. Jones, did you notice while cooking that these eggs were off? I thought the salt might cover the taste, Sir. Get rid of it. I don't suppose you can cook, can you? I can't tell you how badly we need someone with a little flair in the kitchen. What a fucking disappointment. I saw those eggs, I thought it was Christmas. We'll have eggs again. Once everything's back to normal. You Muppet! Look at him. He's still waiting for Marks and Spencer's to reopen. Listen mate, you don't know nothing. I think Bill's got a point. If you look at the whole life of the planet, we... you know, Man has only been around for a few blinks of an eye. So if the infection wipes us all out, that is a return to normality. That what you meant, Bill? Yeah, yeah. Have you met, our New Age sergeant? Our spiritual guru. Tell me, Farrell, exactly why did you join the army in the first place? This is what I've seen in the four weeks since infection. People killing people. Which is much what I saw in the four weeks before infection and the four weeks before that and before that, as far back as I care to remember, people killing people. Which to my mind puts us in a state of normality right now. You're not eating? I don't want to eat. You must eat, Hannah. I don't want to eat. I want to bury my dad. He's one of the people you're talking about. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Move! Move! Move! Move! Enemy in front! Mick, I fucking got one! What do you want, a fucking sweetie? Keep shooting, you cunt! Fucking hell! He bounced! Cease fire! I ain't never seen that in my fucking life! Report clear! Fucking hell! Clear. Clear. Yeah, yeah, clear. Oh, hello! Listen sweetheart, you ain't gonna be needing this any more, right? Cos you got me to protect you now. You wanna get your hands on a really big chopper, you just come and see me... Fuck you! That's an offer, Mitch. Give her some. How about right now? Mitchell! Easy, tiger. You don't wanna go picking a fight with me, son. Sergeant Farrell! Mitchell, first action on. Re-secure the perimeter, Sir. Then get to it. Jones, Bedford, go with him. Slow down. Sergeant? Sir. Clear the bodies off the lawn. The rest of you, go with him. My apologies. Drink? Look, we're grateful, okay? We're very grateful for your protection and just having found new people but if we're gonna stay here... Who've you killed? I haven't killed no one. Since it began who've you killed? You wouldn't be alive now if you hadn't killed somebody. I killed... I killed a boy. A child? Yes. But you had to. Otherwise he'd have killed you. Survival. I understand. I promised them women. What? Eight days ago I found Jones with his gun in his mouth. He said he was going to kill himself because there was no future. What could I say to him? We fight off the infected or we wait until they starve to death and then what? What do nine men do except wait to die themselves? I moved us from the blockade, I set the radio broadcasting and I promised them women. Because women mean a future. Selena! Hannah! What is it, Jim? We have to go. Jim, wait! No time! Come on! Come on! We get in the car and we go! No! You're not going to keep them here! You've got to let them go! You can't keep them here! Stay where you are! I'm not gonna let you keep them here! I'm not gonna let you keep them here! You can't do this! Right, get him! Right, get him! I want to give you a chance. You can be with us. But I can't let them go. Okay, Jim? Okay. Him too. Smithers says "Women and semen don't mix." And Mr. Burns says "We all know what you think, Smithers." And that was my favourite joke in The Simpsons. That's what they're doing a few hundred miles away, across the Channel, across the Atlantic. Eating dinner and watching the fucking Simpsons! They're sleeping in their beds next to their wives. But we're here chained to a fucking radiator because the OC has gone insane! Starting the world again when the rest of the world hasn't even stopped. Just imagine, just think about it. How could infection cross the oceans? How could it cross the mountains and the rivers? It can be stopped. Right now TVs are playing and planes are flying in the sky and the rest of the world is continuing as fucking normal. Think! Actually think about it. What would you do with a diseased little island? They quarantined us. There is no infection. It's just people killing people. He's insane! Time to go. Quarantine? Please. Believe me, I'm not interested. You see, I'm gonna have the black one. And I'm gonna make her squirm. Mitchell, I swear to God it's gonna end badly for you. Move. Come on, move! Get up! Get up, you cunt! Fucking move! Get up! Move your fucking arse! Come on then, you fucking pansies. Do me first. No, Mitch. Mitch, just use the gat. So you're gonna stick me, Mitchell, is that it? Mitchell, shoot 'em! Why? Because it's fucking quicker! Is that how you'd let your sergeant go out, Jones? Fuck I'll shoot them! No, you won't. You'll let him stick me? Like a fucking dog? I'm gonna enjoy this. You stupid cunt! What are you doing? What? You wanna shoot me, do ya? You wanna shoot me? I'll fucking kill you! Where's he fucking gone? What? Where's... Fuck it! Get up! Get after him! Jones, move it! Move! Can you see him? Through there! Oh no. We're fucked. We're fucked! Relax. He's over the wall. He's got no vehicle. And no shooter. He's dead. Now, the first thing we're going to do is make you look a little more presentable. It's so happens that the lady of the house has an extensive wardrobe, which she certainly has no use for. You can't do it to Hannah. No. Go to the master bedroom, pick out a wide selection. Yes, Sir. No... Ladies. No it's only dressing up! No! Selena! I thought girls liked dressing up. Expensive dresses. Come on. Selena! Relax! Selena! Selena! Selena! You need to leave me alone with Hannah. Okay? Listen, all right, the OC... wants... He wants us to dress up nice. If you want us to get changed, you have to leave the room. Okay? It's just polite. Yeah, all right. All right. Come on, lads. Let's leave the room. We're gonna eat these, Hannah, okay? Come on. Eat these. Eat these. Are you trying to kill me? No, sweetheart. I'm making you not care. Okay? What you doing? Someone's at the blockade! Jim! Move! Stay here and put the dresses on. Well, let's go! Go! He went over the wall. We thought he'd be dead. Shut up, Jones! Stay here. Davis? Fuck it! What was that? Lightning. I heard something. It sounded like a Claymore to me. All right, I'll go and hit the floods, take a butcher's. Girls, keep an eye on him, will ya? Those pills, I think they're having an effect. I can feel them. And... I don't feel sleepy. But... They've been a long time. What are you gonna do if they don't come back? Would you be the officer if Henry was dead? Is that the way it works? Shut up. I don't think they are coming back. I think they've been killed. I said shut up! Hannah. They're dead. And you're gonna be next. Get up! We're gonna get out of here. Stay with that, Hannah. Stay with it. Don't worry. I feel fine. Really. Get him off me! Get him off me! It's Jones! It's Jones! Oi! Where the fuck are you going, oi? What's all the fucking shouting about? Well, don't just stand there, you soppy cunt! Get after them! You two, in there! Move! Come on, then! What the fuck you gonna do now? Come on up! Go! Come. Defend these stairs with your fucking life! Hannah! Mailer's loose. Hannah! Sorry... Sir... Hannah? Hannah? Selena? I haven't got any bullets. I haven't got any fucking bullets! Don't fucking leave me! Come on! Move! Move! Move! It's just you and me now, darling. But don't worry, I'm gonna get you out of here. Then we'll find a nice little fucking place somewhere. Just you and me. And we'll live happy ever after, eh? That was longer than a heartbeat. Jim? Listen. Listen. it's not all fucked. We're gonna be okay. It's not all fucked. I've got to explain something... Shut up. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay... Hannah, it's okay! He's not infected. But I thought he was biting you. I was kissing her. Are you stoned? It's a long story. We have to get out of here. Come on! Come on! Move! You killed all my boys. Wait... Hannah! Hannah? Hannah! Hannah! Get in. They're locked. The gates are locked! Just fucking do it! Come on, Jim, breathe! Fucking breathe! Not the curtains as well. You looked all right in this. It's coming! You definitely heard it? Yeah! I can't hear anything! I told you, I heard it! So... Do you think he saw us this time?
