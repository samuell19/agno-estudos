Stop whistling. It’s unlucky to whistle at night. Cut it out! Even if you go tonight, we can still meet again the day after tomorrow, right? I already told you no. What about in three days? I’m working undercover. You can at least call. — It’ll be all right. — I know. You’re not weak, Mitsuru. You’re the best in judo, and with a pistol. What are you doing? That’s dangerous! Nami... Everything’s fine. This is myjob. Don’t do it! It’s too dangerous. I don’t care about a stranger’s drugs. | just want to be with you. I love you. — Turn out the light. — No. Turn it out. I said no — I want to see you. Yui Natsukawa Jinpachi Nezu Minori Terada Kippei Shiina Toshiyuki Nagashima Where’s the package? lt’s you... ALONE IN THE NIGHT Music by Gore Yasukawa Written and Directed by Takashi Ishii Who let? him out here? This is a disgrace. The body had to be identiﬁed. Mrs. Tsuchiya, is it true your husband was selling narcotics on the side? Just one comment please. I haven't had time to organize things. Would you like me to select one? If you don't mind. You know better than me. Even after cremation, his bones are sturdy. His father worked his fingers to the bone so his son could be strong. He was a large man. It's a cruel world... They nixed his pension, even though he died in the line of duty. I sincerely apologize. No, you were so kind to Mitsuru. I should go. Nami, if you need anything at all... l have to go too. Ma'am, are you going to leave your daughter alone? She said she wants to be alone with her husband. I'm sorry... I hope this doesn't hurt. This way, we'll always be together. Yes, who is it? Flower delivery. Just keep your mouth shut. Where are the drugs? Where did you hide them? Who are you people? Where is it? The heroin! — Who are you? — We're here to get what was taken from us. This is a nuisance for the whole neighbourhood. Where the hell is it? What are you doing! Stop! Maybe it's in here. Don't do that! Give it back! Stop! It isn't in there. There's one last place we haven't checked... Stop! Hey, you! Mom... — Where... — You're in the hospital. I didn't die... Someone called an ambulance. lfthey had been ten minutes later... Whoever saved me... I'll hate him till the day I die. Don't talk like that! He filed a complaint with the police on your behalf. What complaint? They were the hoods who killed Mitsuru. Mitsuru's father said he would help. What are you talking about? What do you mean? Why does everyone know? Who's everyone? Weren't they yakuza trying to get back drugs your husband stole from them? Isn't it true that the police have dismissed the case? Wife of a Corrupt Narcotics Agent Wife of a Corrupt Narcotics Agent It's a lie! Wife of a Corrupt Narcotics Agent It's a lie! Ikejima Gang Chief Masanobu Ikejima It's a lie! Ikejima Gang Chief Masanobu Ikejima This is great - one million yen. We'll let you pick up the tab next time we play golf I've been practicing. You prick! This isn't a joke! - Hurry up! Get out of here. - Quit horsing around. Die, Tajima! Don't do anything stupid. Muraki! Where are you? Hurry up! There was another one. He got away. — Are you all right? — I'm fine. Get in. OK, let's roll! Mitsuru... I can't go on. How are you? I already know. I didn't realize how weak I've become. I'm not a young man anymore. My body hurts all over... I can't even raise my arm. From a distance, you looked so peaceful... l envied you. You slept so long, I thought you were dead. I don't know if you were tired... or if someone was calling you from the great hereafter. Mr. Muraki — that's your name, isn't it? Why? I belong to the Ikejima gang. If you pop up again, I'll tell them what you're up to. Got it? Where is it? So that's how it was between you two? — Who pitches and who catches? — I'm the girl in the group. You're going to the toilet again? It must be your prostate. — Could be his bladder. — Maybe he's just lonely. Who said that? — Maybe the mama—san did it to him. — You just stop right there. — That's bullshit. I'm going to have to stop fucking old bags like her. — What a rotten thing to say! Never again, he says! Mr. Chairman, isn't this the girl you like? You know how to pick the hot ones. l'm Mitsuru. Pleased to meet you. Talk is cheap, if you know what! mean. Get out of the way for the young lady. Get the fuck out of the way! Drink. Thank you. — Is she new here? — Yes, she came from in Hokkaido. Then you must know Momoe, from Sakuragi. — That's a soapland, isn't it? — Why are you so well informed? — I don't know about any of this. — She's playing miss innocent. — Sir, is that man also yakuza? — Mitsuru! — You really are innocent. — What a card. Muraki, she seems to have taken a shine to you. Mr. lkejima, what are you saying? Muraki! I'm fine. You'll dance, won't you? Go! I told you to stop. I can't believe you're just a common thug. What the hell are you up to? How can you even be here with me? He's your oyabun. I won't be able to help you next time. Tell whoever you want... you having saved me implicates you as a traitor. What? Cut it out, you're in too deep already. Do you know this song? lt's Sasurai. Not bad, considering your age. It's a sad song. Muraki, why don't you go get a drink? Hey, who the fuck do you think you are? Son of a bitch! Stop, you'll kill him! Stop, you'll kill him! Just leave her there. — Have you got any smack? — Where am |? Here you go. l spent¥1 million on booze tonight. Now l have to take care of you? Where am |? You'll be in heaven soon! — I'm leaving. — Where will you go? Who are you? You're soft... Wait. I need a shower. You smell good. You don't need one. What is that? Show me your tongue. Show me your tongue! A little bit more. Fight me off... Resist more! Shibata! Do it. Do it! I can't. Get Out! I don't want to see your face again. Why? Mr. lkejima! Get out, I said! The chairman is crazy about you... Please don't leave before he wakes up. Did you hear about the visit to the Sakamachi headquarters? It's impossible. The locals won't stand for it. Try throwing a little money at it. This isn't a problem that can be bought. The general contractors are all scared. What if we just drive a truck into the goddamn government ofﬁce? I might win tonight. Let's get it on. I told the mama—san you were taking the night off. Wow, that's great! — I'm out. Too rich for my blood. — I thought you drove a Mercedes Benz! All thanks to you! Beautiful! Is it real? It was a reward for taking a bullet. I want one too! Muraki will give you a pistol; that should be enough. Cut that shit out! — Telephone. — Take a message. — It's about Niigata. Hey, what's up? What? That lousy son of a. . .! Yeah, be careful. — What was it? — He was arrested. Is it the port? They pinched us last month. There's a leak somewhere. Logically, the leak could only have come from my side. — What about the problem we had with the guns? — Enough already! Check on it. |wi||. How long have you been here? Two months. Why can't you play mah—jong yet?! l'd know the chairman's cock in my hands, with my eyes closed! You've got the hands of an expert. Dirty bitch! Mr. Chairman! You worthless piece of shit! Hey, where's the snitch at? I'll take care of him. l'll handle it myself. What are you doing? You're the snitch... You're not getting out of here alive... so tell the truth. Are you a cop? What gang sent you? Spit it out! You're fucking dead! You whore! You have a try. Get out of my way! What the fuck are you goofballs doing? Get back to work! Chairman's orders. They caught the snitch. He'll be flushed down the sewer shortly. Who was it? What's it to you? What? This slut tried to kill the chairman. Who do you think you're talking to? Your story stinks to high heaven! You're fucking in on this! Muraki, who was it? It was Kasuga. Give me a break! He was in a biker gang. Where's your proof? Detective Kazuya Kasuga Who brought Kasuga in? It was you, Shibata. — This must be some sort of mistake. — lt checks out. You got a problem with that? So who is she? — She tried to kill the chairman. — I couldn't say. Her attempt on the chairman's life had nothing to do with the snitch. Then who is she?! I don't know. Never seen her before. Ask her yourself. Maybe she was just trying to give me a manicure?! Beat her till she talks! Chairman, I didn't investigate the matter thoroughly. Who are you going to believe, me or Shibata? l have your answer. Take him to the hospital! OK, just sell her off in Chiba or somewhere. Give the buyer a good price. OK, we can take turns on her One-two—three, paper-scissors-stone. It's a tie. Buy us a drink, sailor. Looking for anyone in particular? Don't you remember? We screwed 10 days ago. I guess there're too many faces for you to keep track of! I want to violate every orifice of your body! Let's fuck till dawn! What the hell do you want? Leave us alone! I don't like guys who don't know when to stop. Get out. Your key. You drove here, yes? Recently, a customer went off with a Filipina and didn't bring her back. We'll drive you to the hotel. Hiroshi! That's no good. I left the keys in the car. Where is it? - Over there. - You can 't park there. My key. You had it from the start! You weren't easy to find. The hotel is on the left. I'm taking you back to Tokyo. lfl don't get customers, I can't get off. Forget about it. Do you have anyjunk? I said, no. Give it to me! I want the needle! — I want the needle! — You didn't get your revenge! Die! Die! Die! Do Not Enter Did you wash yourself? Here. Are you cold? Eat. lt's poisoned, isn't it? You want me dead! You dick! Who would eat this? I need a fix, not food! lt's poisoned! Give me heroin! Give me heroin! — lt's maggots! — What's wrong? What's wrong? What is it? Maggots! lt's maggots! All over me! — Maggots! — Maggots? They're everywhere! Take it easy. Where are they? There they are. OK, I got them. It's OK. Get them off of me! Here. | see. It's all right. They're gone now. It's all right... I'll let you fuck me, so just do it. Shoot in my mouth, give it to me in the ass — I don't care! — Cut that out! — What are you doing? Let me go! You've got drugs hidden somewhere! You're a dirty cop! I hope you die! Being a cop is a shit life! Are you listening? This building is an abortion... A construction company left it half—built... Even yakuza don't come here. OK, you just sleep. It smells... Is it spoiled? It's not the food. It's the place. It smells like mould. We can go somewhere else. Can I... take a bath? — Here's something for you. — Thanks. I'll leave your undenivear here. I can't wring it out. Could you... do my back? l'm embarrassed — I'm so filthy! Once the grime is washed away, you're just a petite thing. How much time has passed... since I've been here? About a month. — Doesn't the gang care if we use this place? — It's fine. I'm tired... I'm sorry. It's not your fault... painful memories die hard. They don't go away that easily. You just need rest... you'll be able to wring out the towel yourself in no time. Do you have a pistol? It's OK - l'm strong enough to use it. Teach me how. You really want this, don't you? How do you use it? Grip it tight. Don't put your finger on the trigger till you're ready to shoot. Extend your elbow. Support your right hand with your left, like this. Aim it at the light. lfl do it this way, I can kill someone, right? Yes. I need you to rescue me one more time. Let go! This time, you won't be able to get close to him that easily. l'm disgusted with myself for having slept with so many men. So many men have been inside of me... You're the most beautiful woman I've ever met. Stop. Oh, good evening, sir. Open the door. OK, call. All bets are in. First, additions. Next, cards. All bets are in. First, even. Next, odd. — Where's the toilet? — It's over there. — I'll show you the way. — I'll find my own way. Who are you? You need an introduction to get in. It's a bust! It's a bust! The chairman... Muraki's the informant. Mr. Chairman, this way. Turn off the lights! — Mr. Chairman! Where's the chairman? — I don't know. Mr. chairman! This way. There's an elevator this way. If we leave the door open at the top, it can't be summoned to this floor. Son of a bitch! We have to hide on the roof for now. — The police can't get us, right? — It'll be fine. No, you stay here. | just have to go up. You get out of here. Go! What the hell was that idiot thinking of, sending me up to the roof? Ikejima! Who is that? Mitsuru? What the hell are you doing here? l was waiting for you! What do you think you're doing? You're angry I sold you? You were going to be killed othenivise! I believe you know Mitsuru Tsuchiya? Tsuchiya? He was a government narcotics agent you framed and had murdered two years ago. An agent? I came to clear his name. You're going to give yourself up and confess everything. He was your... husband? Answer me! — It wasn't me. — Answer me! This is the real frame—up job. When you're as high up as me, you don't have to do the dirty work anymore. Then who was it? Who? I had no idea he was an undercover cop. He did it of his own volition. Who did? Give me the gun. You're a junked—up slut, trying to purge your anger... over your dead husband through murder. Don't make me laugh! Please forgive my inexcusable behaviour! I had no idea you held any grudge at all against me. I committed an unpardonable act. I'm a disgrace to my nation... I'm a disgrace to my parents, my friends, my brothers, to my wife... Losing everything, as a human being... That's how it goes! This reminds me of how you looked when l was banging you. Then I'm going to blow you away! Strip naked, right here! Tell me who did it! Bitch, I don't think you fully understand your predicament! Who did it? What a pretty face! My cock is hard enough to scratch glass! Before you die, I'm going to tell you... Stop! I'm arresting you for illegal gambling and possession of a ﬁrearm. You son of a... She's the guilty one... Are you all right? Take it easy... What are you two dogs doing? I thought her face looked familiar... We murdered your husband! Mr. Chairman! Get away from me! I mean it! It's over... Nami, it's over. What's wrong? We have to get out of here. My gun... I need my gun. | always thought he'd protect me. He said the engraving on this gun meant something to him. He took it and left. he didn't kill my husband. l'm Muraki, of the narcotics division of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. I had been working undercover for over ten years to break up the drug operations of the lkejima gang. Your husband was murdered... l was powerless to stop it. I don't know anything about that. It's a lie, isn't it? His thinking was extremely rigid — I don't mean that in a bad way. l was the same way ten years before. Your husband worked for the Ministry of Health and Welfare, but I'm a cop! I spent years of my life underground, in constant danger. I got tattoos... I shot dope... l raped women... — all to prevent blowing my cover. — And you killed my husband. He called... He called me a dirty cop. He threatened to turn me in. I gave the drugs to my family. Your family? My wife got addicted and lost her mind. Tell me you're lying. I thought he would understand. — I'm not without a conscience. — Tell me it's a lie! I thought... the heart engraved on his gun... was childish. The gun wasn't enough... to save your husband. It's a lie! It's a lie! l have something that belongs to you... Don't move! Don't move! Don't move! Don't move! Stop! Freeze! It says, "To Nami..."
