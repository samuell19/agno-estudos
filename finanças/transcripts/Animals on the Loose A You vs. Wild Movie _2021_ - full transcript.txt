What weighs 400 pounds, can run at 50 miles an hour and is trying to eat me? Yep. A lion! This side's locked! Bear to ranger station. This is mission control. Go ahead, Bear. The fence has been breached. I've even got some lion hair on this. Looks like we've got a lion loose. That's terrible. How could the lion have breached the fence? It's electrical. There's no electricity going through the fence. Bear, this lion is a danger to other animals and any people in the area. This is Ranger Rogan on the south side. There's no power here either, guys, and Thimba the baboon is missing. There must be a damaged powered relay plate from somewhere. Okay. Roger that. So, it looks like we've got three different missions, one big adventure and I'm going to need your help. You ready? Welcome to one of the wildest animal sanctuaries in South Africa. The protective fence that surrounds the sanctuary has mysteriously lost power. A lion and a baboon have already gone missing and there could be more lost animals out there. We've got three urgent missions. To the north, we must track down that loose lion and protect any people that might be in the area. To the south, we must rescue Thimba the baboon, from the jagged sea cliffs and hungry predators. And to the east, we've got to fix a damaged hydro-electric relay station that powers the fence using water at the bottom of that gorge. But it looks like a storm is moving in and that could flood our path. If we don't get that power back on, more animals could get out. The order we take to try and carry out these missions is up to you. And every decision could impact our progress. So, make your choices count. Okay, let's gear up. Okay, backpacks and rope. Radio. And then I'm going to take some of these smoke emergency flare canisters. And if I'm in trouble, you pop that, bright orange smoke. The rangers will see it. They come and get us. Only got three of them, though. Once we're out of those, then rescue ain't coming. So, what do you reckon we do first? Power, lion, or the baboon? Choose wisely, you know. Going to have big implications which order we do this in. So, time is ticking. And on these adventures, time has big consequences. We want to beat the storm to restore that power, but that lion is moving fast and that baboon could be in trouble. This is a tough call. Let's get going before any more animals go missing. I ditched the truck for a helicopter, so that we can get to those sea cliffs faster. This chopper is going to take me to where Thimba was last spotted, but it's difficult terrain down there. This is the Horn of Africa, some of the most dangerous seas in the whole world. Powerful currents, huge waves and sea full of great white sharks. Our priority is to get down there and pick up the trail of Thimba. But there's no way that the chopper is going to be able to land. So, I'm going to use a technique that the Special Forces use. It's called fast-roping. A little bit closer. Okay, I'm good here. Chopper gone. Down on the ground. Now to find Thimba. Come on. Oh, look, some fruit. These are edible. Look, num-num berry. They actually taste good. Look, actually, with all of this dead wood, we'll probably get some grubs as well here. Oh, look. Here we go. Whoa! Boy! Look at this guy. Phew! And that's a cutworm. Look at the pincers on it. A lot of energy in that. Okay, so we've got num-num berry, or the cutworm. I guess this is going to give more short-term fruit sugar hit. And this is more longer-term energy and protein. Definitely not going to taste as good though. Okay, num-num berries. Delicious. Mm. Sweet, juicy. Good hit of energy. So, let's take some more of these. You never know when these berries might come in handy. Oh, look at this. Here's some tracks. But look, these aren't baboon. These are cheetah. See that? One, two, three, four, boom. Which for our baboon, for Thimba, is not good news. Cheetahs and baboons are enemies in the wild. If they cross paths, it could turn deadly. So, we've got to find Thimba before that cheetah does. This beach is surrounded by sea cliffs in both directions. So, Thimba must have headed inland, but that baboon could be hiding anywhere and so could that cheetah. So, we better keep a good lookout. Look, these are baboon prints here, heading that way. Look at that! Look. There's Thimba. Not a care in the world. Look. Big yawn. They're so human-like, really, you know, and they're very social, baboons. They'll often be in a group of up to 50. Close bond between mother and child always, but don't be deceived, when they need to fight, they can be super aggressive. And especially to defend themselves and their young. Why did they take off? That is why they took off. That cheetah is in hunting mode… and probably picked up the scent of Thimba. And that is bad. We do not want that cheetah… hunting Thimba. Oh, no. Look, he's getting closer. Okay, I don't know whether we try and set up some sort of lure… to get Thimba over towards us, protect him from the cheetah that way. Or… maybe just scare Thimba away from the cheetah. The problem with doing that, though, is once I scare Thimba off, I'm going to have to track him again. So, what's the best way to protect Thimba from that cheetah? Lure him over here, or scare him off in the other direction? Okay, look at these. Nice and juicy. So, we use that on a long bit of string. Throw that in front of Thimba. It's time to find out how much baboons like num-num berries. Okay, let's try this. Hey, Thimba. There you go, boy. There you go. Come on! Keep coming. He loves that. Come on, plenty more of these. Come on. He's loving this. Come on. He's taken most of the berries. Come on, there are more here. Come on… There we go. Come on. No, no, don't take that last one. I need to keep you moving towards me. Come on, Thimba. Here we go. Come on. Here we go. Last one, here. Ah! Well, he's got the last of the num-num berries. That was a good idea until he scratched me. Guess we got a little too close. Sharp nails. They're smart, these baboons. Look, all the num-nums gone. And Thimba gone. He doesn't play by the rules, this baboon. It doesn't look like there's any sign either of the cheetah, which is good. We need to get back on Thimba's trail. Now, which way did he go? The tracks come this way. The tracks are heading south. It looks like Thimba is circling back to those dangerous sea cliffs, along the shore. So, we'd better hurry. Look, you got tracks on that bit. Much windier down here. You can actually see… it looks like a storm coming in as well. I'm going to get a jacket on. The thing is, baboons can climb so well on sort of rocky, craggy cliffs like this. Follow this way and then have a look. Be careful. These rocks are getting a lot more slippery. Keep an eye out for Thimba. He's going to be somewhere around here. Look at all this trash. You know, even in a remote, beautiful part of Africa… trash… and I see it so often in really wild places, just how much garbage and plastic gets washed up. That's why you got to be so careful with… using as little plastic as you need in life, just 'cause it takes hundreds and sometimes thousands of years to disintegrate. Otherwise, you see it everywhere. Wow, look. There's a big old surf coming in here. Have to be a bit careful. See if we can see Thimba up on any on these headlands. Look, I think that's him. There's Thimba, sitting right on that rock pinnacle. Okay, good job. Well, at least we've found him. Just how to reach him. Either we try and keep co-steering round and go up this cliff… But this is all going to be razor sharp. I've got a little bit of rope, but not much. I've got no guaranteed way of securing that either. Or maybe try and swim it. That is rough, dangerous seas. Sharks, powerful currents. But it's probably the most direct way to get to him. Or we could make a raft out of all of that flotsam and jetsam and rubbish and trash and use that to float across to Thimba. It's probably safer than getting in with the sharks and maybe safer than trying to climb these when I've got no secure anchor points. Oh, no, that big wave just scared Thimba. We need to hurry and make a decision before he gets too far away. Some of the garbage we saw earlier, going to use that to make a raft. Bring it down to the shoreline, we'll make it down there. Get a load of it, get some wood. Problem is, with wood, is that you think it's good for raft building, but, actually, it's so heavy and doesn't float very well. But you need it for the structure. So, we'll literally just use this to make the frame… and then use all of these cans in the middle as a buoyancy. And then this old bit of net over the whole thing… to keep the cans in place. And then look, even a seat. Yeah, that's going to work. Okay, let's tie all this together. I think we're good to launch this. I don't know how stable it's going to be. You know what they say: "One man's trash, another man's treasure." Come on. Here we go. These seas are getting really rough. Just pray this raft holds together. I can feel that riptide. It is strong. And those waves are getting bigger. Okay, let's not get smashed into these rocks here. Okay, we've made it! Come on, almost there. That raft held up okay. Got me across the inlet… and now to try and go and find this… troublesome baboon. Oh, look, figs. Baboons love figs. Get a few of these. That will help me entice Thimba to come closer. He's just round the corner. I don't want to make the same mistake I made before of scaring him off. I'm going to use these figs to try and lure him in. Okay, we're going to dig a little pit here, put the figs in it… and make a slip knot. And then hopefully, Thimba will come along, reach down to grab the figs. Baboons are smart, but they're also greedy. And then when he reaches down, I can pull that slip knot, catch his hand, get him, get him back to the reserve, get him safe. Okay, we're going to dig it here. Okay, so pretend my finger is Thimba's arm and once the snare's in place, pull the line tight and the great thing about slip knots is once they're tightened, they're not going to loosen. Okay, so that's the snare. Okay, now to be patient and wait. Thimba! Go on, eat! We got him! Hey, Thimba, calm down. Here you go, have a fig. There you go. Hey, guys. Got you loud and clear, Bear. Go ahead. So, Thimba is happy, eating figs. You can come and collect him from this cave. That's great news. Well done. We're sending the chopper to pick you and Thimba up right now. Roger that. Nice work rescuing Thimba. Mission accomplished. Check it out. We just got word from the rangers. They think the power was cut on purpose. But why? And by whom? Okay, we've still got two urgent missions. What should we do next? We've got to restore the power by fixing that relay station in the gorge. And it looks like that storm is getting closer. But let's not forget about finding that loose lion. He's on the move and there are reports of an animal researcher working in the area. He might need our help. We've got a lot of ground to cover and when you're on open savannah, one of the best ways to travel is on horseback. It's fast, it can go anywhere, which is great, because we've got no idea where this lion could be. Definitely smoke over there. Heh. Looks like someone's camping there and it smells like they're cooking food. That's like ringing the dinner bell for this escaped lion. We need to get over there. Come on. Okay, I'm going to tie up my horse over here where it's safe and also it's far away from the smell of that cooking food. That must be the researcher I heard was working in this area. But what's he looking at? Oh no, we've found our lion. Okay, we need to move fast. How are we going to get the researcher safe, though? Maybe we use either a log from the fire, trying that to scare the lion away, or we sneak behind the tent… and just cut into the tent to get the researcher out and scarper back this way. The problem is, the lion's probably going to be able to smell me as well. It's a difficult choice. Either way, we've got to make a decision fast. That researcher is in danger. Oh, man, that lion is too close for comfort. This just might work. Don't worry, buddy. Get in the tent. Hey! Come on. Get away! Get away, get away! Stay in the tent. Get away! Get away! Hey! Oh, that's good. He's going. Oh, boy. We're all right, buddy. It's good. It's gone. Okay, what I need you to do, got a horse a few hundred meters straight through the trees there. Back to the reserve. I'm going to track the lion on foot. Okay, now to find this lion. Okay, we're going to head this way. So, come on. It's getting late and once the sun sets, we'll have no chance of finding that lion. So, we need to hurry. Look at that, look, birds taking off there. Look, a little springbok. I don't see any injuries. Must have died of dehydration, just not enough water. And that's not uncommon in a harsh environment like this. Yeah, I'm going to take some of this meat and then move away from here. Okay. And then maybe we can use some of this meat… either to eat… or as bait later on if we need it. One thing about doing all of this and carrying meat is that I've now got the scent of that on me. And really, out here, that makes me just as much prey as this springbok. As we move across the savannah, I'm keeping my eyes peeled for signs of that lion. I think we're getting close. Okay, look, that's the lion over there. And it looks like he's more settled now. I just wonder if I can make like a natural kraal out of some of these bushes around here. It's called a boma. Normally, what you use a boma for is to protect a camp. You put lots of thorny bushes and branches around your camp and it keeps predators out. But you could also use it… to keep a predator in. A hundred meters away, I reckon we could lure him back here. Either we use some of that meat from the carcass, set a trail and try and hope that the lion will follow it in, we can close off the entrance. Or we go for the live-bait option and I use myself as that bait and try and entice and get that lion to chase me, run in and then shut the entrance off. It may be difficult to get the lion's attention, though, and to keep him focused on the trail. Two options. What do you reckon? Should we be the bait, or should we use the meat to try and lure that lion in? Yeah, he's not moving now. Okay, we'll make a trail with chunks of meat from that springbok. But first, we've got to build the boma. Okay, come on. You use a bunch of these branches. The thorny ones lower down here are to really stop the lion getting out and then these bushes are just all intertwined to make a barrier. Then once the lion's in there, all I've got to do is drop it into place. Like this. Okay, now to try and go lure the lion in. Okay, chunks of meat… that any lion is going to enjoy. And this is going to lead all the way back to the boma. Okay. Now we've got to be patient and wait. He can definitely smell that meat. Question is, is he hungry? Okay, so that's the… the bait set. And now it's a waiting game. It's getting late and we don't want to be tracking a lion after dark. So, let's hope this works and soon. He's coming. Oh, here we go. It's working. The lion's picked up the trail and heading straight towards the boma. Oh, hold on, hold on. He's turning this way. No, he must smell the meat on me. This isn't good. The lion's picked up my scent. It's coming straight this way. Get away! Hey! Hey! Hey! I'm going to pop one of these flares and hope that deters it. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! That was a close call. The smoke has scared the lion off for now, but it's getting too late to follow it. Luckily, the rangers will see that smoke, but they'd better hurry, because now the lion has the scent of something much bigger… me. We failed to capture the lion this time. Remember, never try to outsmart a hungry lion. The rangers still don't know who cut the power, but they think it could be either poachers or hunters. But what are they after? Poachers hunt protected animals for their hides and tusks. So, we've got to restore the power in order to protect those animals. That means we must head into the gorge and fix that damaged hydroelectric relay station. Are you ready? Let's do this. The gorge is located in a dense jungle and there's no roads. So, we're going to have to use a machete and cut our own path. Ranger station to Bear, do you copy? Yeah, copy that. Bear, when you reach the relay station, make sure to reset the terminal before restarting the power. The correct order is negative, positive, negative. Got it? Roger, got it. Bear out. Okay, you've got to remember that, negative, positive, negative. And, you know, sometimes having a good memory in the wild can make the difference between life and death. And I always remember things by thinking of, like, a phrase or a story that relates to that letter. So, if it's negative, positive, negative, N-P-N, maybe we could do, like: "No panthers in Nigeria." N-P-N. We'll remember that. Okay, let's keep going. Looks like that storm has already passed. I hope the gorge isn't flooded. We're too late. If we'd come sooner, the gorge would have had a lot less water in it, but it's still the fastest way to restore that power. So, we've got to get down there. Really clear, this water. I can see down. No rocks underneath this. This is good to jump. And then we're into the gorge and we get moving. Okay, heading up. We've managed to cover a lot of ground so far. Good work. We've made our way down into the gorge, but the hydroelectric relay station is still several miles from our current location. It's the only way to restore power and protect those animals. So, we need to keep moving through the gorge until we find it. Oh, look, I'm bleeding from… Oh, it's a leech. Oh, look at this guy. And what they do, they inject an anticoagulant into your skin and that just stops your blood clotting. And that's why it bleeds so much. There we go. Oh, my God! Look at the size of that one. And that is just full of blood. You can, though, eat leeches and that will have good protein in it. Either you try and just swallow it whole, you just want to be a bit careful with them, though. Don't want them stuck in your mouth, or you bite it and you're going to get a mouthful of all the insides and the blood. You never pass up food in the wild. You just never know where your next meal's going to be. Either… try and swallow it whole, or chew it. Okay, it's going to be like nature's sausage. Full of blood. Done. Protein hit. Time to keep going. Urgh, got to wash that leech taste out of my mouth. Just remember, in the wild, you never want to be drinking water that you just come across. You don't know what's in it. You know, this even looked pretty stagnant and dirty, but even if the water's clear, it doesn't mean you can drink it. You know, clear water is not clean water. If you drink this sort of stuff, it makes you sick, dehydrated, you vomit and then you end up in trouble. Always boil water before you drink it. Constrictor! Once they get a grip around, they can be really hard to get off. Especially around the neck. But how to get him off? Either you try and fight him. Or take him underwater and hope that he'll release you. Either way, make a decision! Guys, it's… It's going to be hard. Boas break you when he's got a grip round your neck. You're in big trouble! This is getting tighter around my neck. This is way too strong. It's getting harder to breathe now. Okay, I'm going to need help here. We're going to have to burn one of those emergency… emergency flares. I just hope that the rangers… get here quick. Help! Help! Help! We failed to restore the power this time. Remember, never try to wrestle a boa constrictor. Hang on. We just got word that a herd of elephants is missing from the sanctuary. Could it be that whoever cut that power was after the elephants? That means poachers, so, we've got to hurry. They were last seen heading further north. We've got to find those elephants before the poachers do. Let's go. So, we're heading to the last place that the elephants were spotted… to try and find them. We're pretty far out, but, we're not going to give up. Those elephants need help. Look. Yeah, wow, look at the size of that. If there's dung this size, there's elephants around. Okay. Wow, look, elephant dung here. Looks like they're moving this way. Okay. Oh, yeah, look at that. There are the elephants. Oh, just so beautiful. Majestic and very big. Oh, no, look, there's a vehicle moving fast. And that could well be the poachers. Oh, no! Not another lion! Not again! This side's locked. Either we go up this tree, or go under the truck. Be quick, the lion's coming! Hurry! Okay, under the truck! Maybe we could trap the lion in the back. Now's our chance. This is risky. Careful now. The lion's secure. Now to go and help the elephants. I've told the rangers to retrieve the lion, so we can stay on the trail of those elephants. They're on an old dirt road on the other side of a massive canyon. It'll take too long to drive around, so, we've taken the truck as far as we can. Now we've got to get across that canyon fast. So, from here on in, we're on foot. Poachers are probably only a mile or so from those elephants. We need to find a way across this canyon. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop. This is the edge of the canyon. And look at this. Runs all the way across. It's an old ranger line. They used to transport equipment back and forth across this canyon. It's just whether we use that, try to shin across it… or downclimb, cross and then climb up the other side of those cliffs. So, it's two choices. Use this line or downclimb and then climb up the other side. You know, the reality is both are risky options here. This is going to be physical, not one to get wrong. Let's go. Oh, this is hard! And that is a long drop. Okay, keep hauling. Phew! Got to keep the legs up… and take my weight and then haul with the hands. Haul with the hands. Keep pulling. Keep pulling. Come on. Come on. Never… give… up. Phew! Almost there, last bit. Come on, keep pulling. Keep pulling. Come on. Oh, boy! That was hard work. Wow! It's amazing the strength you can find when there's no choice. Okay, get moving. Try and reach those elephants, pronto! There are the elephants there. Come on! Poachers. And what they want are the elephants. Okay, so we've found the elephants, which is good. If we can get them down to the watering hole now, hidden by these bushes and all of this scrub and hopefully, the poachers will stay on the road and the bushes and the terrain will hide the elephants. Let's get them right down there. Come on, guys. Here we go. Keep moving. Down to the water. Come on! Down to the water. Keep going. Come on! We need to get them down there fast and hide them from the poachers. Come on. Come on! Keep moving! Keep moving! Keep moving. Come on. Down to the water! Come on! Down to the water! Keep going. Come on! Come on. Keep moving. Keep going. Come on. Here we go. Shh! Trying to keep elephants quiet is not easy. Well done, the elephants. Good job! That's the poachers gone and they didn't see us down here. Phew! Nice job. We've bought some time for the rangers to get down here and bring these elephants back safely to the sanctuary. And I, for one, feel pretty proud of what we've done and so should you. When you work hard to protect something vulnerable and beautiful, that's a great thing. But it all comes down to making good survival decisions. But sometimes making good survival decisions, when you're under pressure, isn't easy. You know, but the more you practice it, being used to that pressure, being able to think calmly when it's all happening, that is a key part of life and survival. And your quick thinking and good decisions has helped these elephants. Well done! What a team. We saved those elephants from the poachers. Mission accomplished. Nice work. We still need to restore the power and find that lion. What should we do next? If we'd done things in a different order, we might've got a different outcome. There are many ways to take on this adventure and who knows what we've missed. Let's try again and make different decisions. Remember, never give up. The gorge is located in a dense jungle and there's no roads. So, I had to ditch the truck for a machete. We're going to have to cut our own path. Ranger station to Bear, do you copy? Yeah, copy that. Bear, when you reach the relay station, make sure to reset the terminal before restarting the power. The correct order is negative, positive, negative. Got it? Roger, got it. Bear out. Okay, you've got to remember that, negative, positive, negative. And sometimes having a good memory in the wild can make the difference between life and death. And I always remember things by thinking of, like, a phrase or a story that relates to that letter. So, if it's negative, positive, negative, N-P-N, maybe we could do, like: "No panthers in Nigeria." N-P-N. We'll remember that. Okay, let's keep going. Ah, looks like we beat the storm. Good work. Oh, careful of the edge. Big hundred-foot drop down into this gorge. But if we're going to reach this relay power station, that's where we've got to go. We want to get down into this. We're going to have to rappel and it looks like we're going to get wet. We need to find something to tie up to here. Maybe one of these little trees. The thing is, these look really spindly and they are at the top. But at the bottom, maybe if we use enough of them together, get the rope around… it might be strong enough. Or we just try and get around this rock. I mean, rock is always going to be stronger. But the problem with rock, especially this sort of one, sharp edges. Look at that. That can cut through the rope really easy, especially when that rope's under tension. Rock… or those trees. We're going to go round this rock here. Tie a bowline in it, make a loop, rabbit comes out of the hole, around the tree, back down the hole. If your life depends on it, with a bowline, always put a couple of hitches into it. One, two. So, that's secure. So, that's not going to come undone. The rock is strong. The rope is good. It's just these few sharp edges and they're not ideal. But that storm's coming in. We're in a hurry. The animals are depending on us. We've got to get that power back on. Okay. Here we go. Okay, just hoping that rope running over that rock… is okay. Pretty committed now. Especially over this overhanging bit. Here we go. Okay, it looks like this rope's going to be good. The rope snapped! Ah, my leg! I knew I'd hurt myself on that. It's just a cut along the outside of the leg. The problem is, really, it's a nightmare environment to try and clean a wound in this sort of thing. I think I'm going to have to leave it for now and then deal with it later. It really needs to get clean and then dry. Okay, but we need to keep going now. Out on the open savannah, the terrain is unpredictable. So, we've ditched the truck for this horse. Definitely smoke over there. Looks like someone's camping there and it smells like they're cooking food. That's going to be like ringing the dinner bell for this escaped lion. We need to get over there. Come on. Okay, I'm going to tie up my horse over here where it's safe and also, it's far away from the smell of that cooking food. Oh, look, I heard there are animal researchers working in this area. That's got to be one of them. But this isn't good. Nothing attracts a lion more than the smell of meat over an open flame. So we've got to decide how we're going to keep the researcher safe. Either we can build what's called a boma, which is where you get lots of dead branches and thorny bushes, and you make a ring all the way round his camp. It's like a natural defense against any predators. Or we just take that food that he's cooking and take it a long way away from the camp. Will a boma be strong enough? Or do you think I can lure the lion away from the camp with that meat? - Hey, buddy. - Hey. A lion's broken free from the sanctuary and it's likely headed in this direction. We should make sure you get some protection and we're going to get this off here. - That's my dinner. - This is not good to have around. Maybe we can make a bit of a… You know the bomas? - Yeah. - A ring of protection around you. Use a bunch of these branches. - Okay. Is the lion close? - That one, we don't know. - Okay. - Let's be prepared. Bomas are used all through Africa by indigenous people as a way keeping their families, their camps and their homes safe And it's just made up of lots of these really thorny, gnarly branches and they're layered, almost like a sort of barbed wire perimeter around the camp. It keeps predators away. - That's looking pretty good. - Yeah. Almost got a 360 perimeter boma fence here. A fire in the entrance. Oh, that must be our lion! Okay, just grab a stick. That is one big beast. Get away! Go on! Hey! Get back! Get away! Hit it back! Get back! Whoa! Whoa! Go on! Hey! Damn, I don't know how your heart rate is, but… mine… is up. Okay, so what I need you to do is take the horse, get yourself to safety. I'm going to try and stay on the track of this lion now, all right? Okay, yeah. But yeah, don't hang around. Just take your gear, on the horse, go. Okay, now to find this lion. Who knows where he is. Okay. We're going to head this way. Come on. Look, actually, with all of this dead wood, we'll probably get some grubs as well here. Oh, look, here we go. Whoa! Boy, look at this guy. Woo! And that's a cutworm. Look at the pincers on it. A lot of energy in that. But it's not going to taste nearly as nice as a yum-yum berry. But after what happened with that leech, I could do now with some real energy. I guess this is going to give more short-term fruit sugar hit. And this is more longer-term energy. What do we think? Okay, we're going to go for the protein hit. Want to take that head off… so that doesn't bite. Ugh! But good protein. I'm not quite feeling it yet, though. Terrible. Phew! Okay, but worth trying to find a few more of these to take with me. Oh, here's one. Oh, here we go, one more. Okay, pocket full of cutworms. Good. Oh, look at this, here's some tracks. But look, these aren't baboon. These are cheetah. See that? One, two, three, four, boom. Which for our baboon, for Thimba, is not good news. Cheetahs and baboons are enemies in the wild. If they cross paths, it could turn deadly. So, we've got to find Thimba before that cheetah does. This beach is surrounded by sea cliffs in both directions. So, Thimba must have headed inland. But that baboon could be hiding anywhere and so could that cheetah. So, we'd better keep a good lookout. And look, the good thing also about the num-num berries are these little spikes. They've got anesthetic properties which means, like the name… they make an area go numb if you just prick a wound like the cut on my leg. Give it a prick with that, it will make the area go numb. Ah, that feels better already. Pretty cool, though. The num-num thorns. That storm's getting close and if it's raining up river, that gorge is going to flood, so, we'd better hurry. This gorge here is classic flash-flood territory. You do not want to get caught in this. But the relay station we're trying to reach is straight down in this direction. But this water's flowing faster every second because of that storm upriver. We need to climb down there before it's too late. Let's do this. The water level is definitely rising here. That's going to make this much more dangerous. Here we go. Ah! It's getting pretty hard to hold on here. Two choices. I can just hold on here, try and muscle it up and hope that the water level doesn't rise any higher. Or do you stop holding on and just go with it and shoot down it? Problem is, you don't know what's at the bottom of this. But this is definitely getting more powerful by the minute here. It's going to get pretty hard to hold on. What are you going to do? Getting hard to hold on. Starting to lose my grip. Ah! Ah! Ah! My leg. Oh, trying to fight the power of that water was a mistake. I held on as long as I could, but then it just, like, catapulted me down this gorge. When I landed on the bottom, I really whacked my leg as well. Oh, boy. Ow. I knew I'd hurt myself from that. It's just a cut along the outside of the leg. The problem is, really, it's a nightmare environment to try and clean a wound in this sort of thing. I think I'm going to have to leave it for now and then deal with it later. It really needs to get clean and then dry. Okay, but we need to keep going now. Hey, buddy, got a lion on the loose. I'm going to take this… and get it away from your camp. That's my dinner. Look, the lion. Hey, come, pussy cat. Lunch! Come on! I'm never going to outrun a lion. I think the best thing to do now is wait for it to get a bit closer and then launch this into these bushes and I go fast the other way.0 Okay, he's coming. Here we go! Come on! Okay, go! Go! Looks like the lion took the bait! Phew! Well, that's a good distance now between me and the lion and also the researcher and the lion. He's taken that leg of lamb and the lion's gone into the bushes, but… who knows where he is from there? This way. We're going to go around a bunch of these. Even if one of them breaks, hopefully, collectively, they'll hold me. And then we'll tie a bowline in it, make a loop. Rabbit comes out of the hole around the tree and back down the hole. With a bowline, if your life depends on it, always put a hitch in as well. So, like that, so it definitely can't come undone. Okay, that's going to be strong. Okay. Here we go. It's a long way. Hoping those bushes are okay as an anchor point. Pretty committed now. Let's do this. Come on, almost there. Okay, that worked. So, I've just got to wait until the water level rises and then go with it! Let's do this. Wow! Whoa! Woo! Whoa! Wah! Sometimes, you can't fight the power of nature. If you've got no choice, you're just sometimes best going with the flow. These sort of ravines and gorges are so dangerous. If you don't know your landing, don't go down them unless you've got no choice. But if you are going down them, that is the way to do it. Go with the flow, feet forward, hands to fend off. Protect your head. That'll work. That is not a good sound. That is the sound of fighting. Yeah, look. Baboon and cheetah going at each other. We do not want that. These guys are equal match for each other in the wild. If they fight, both creatures lose their life. Okay, we need to break them up somehow. One thing you can do is just make yourself look bigger. Maybe if I use this stick and my jacket. Put one limb through each sleeve and hopefully when I charge at them, they're going to stop fighting and back away. Hey! Come on. Come on! Come on! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Go on! Go on! Go on! Yeah! Hey! Go on! Go on! Go on! Go on! Well, the immediate danger, at least, is gone. Stopped them killing each other. But Thimba's run off into this brush somewhere. Just going to try and pick up the trail again. Come on. Let's see if baboons like worms, like these guys. Okay. Hey, Thimba. Come on! Protein. Come on, eat! Come on, Thimba. Go on, try it. Here we go. Come on. Here we go. Go on. It's good protein. Oh, he's just really not going for those. Come on, Thimba. Go on, try it. God, I've never known a baboon to be so picky. Thimba, eat! Oh, this isn't working. Oh, no, and that cheetah is getting closer as well. Come on, Thimba. Come on! Come on! Thimba just spotted the cheetah. Okay, we need to get back on Thimba's trail. Come on! Come on! Hey! Hey! Come on! Hey! Go on! Hey! Hey! Go on! Go on! Hey! Get out of here! Get out of here! Go on! Go on! Oh! Throwing scat at me! Get out of here! Go on! Get out! Ya! Go! Go! Go! Come on! Hey! Hey! There he goes. Okay, so he's in the thick brush there. Where's that cheetah? And also no sign of the cheetah now. Okay, we need to get back on Thimba's trail. Look, you got tracks on that bit. Much windier down here. You can actually see… it looks like a storm coming in as well. Glad we've already restored that power, 'cause that gorge is probably flooded by now. The thing is, baboons can climb so well on sort of rocky, craggy cliffs like this. Follow this round and have a look. Be careful. These rocks are getting a lot more slippery. Keep an eye out for Thimba. He's going to be somewhere round here. Probably the easiest way of doing this is to make a monkey fist, a big knot at the end of the rope… and then get it up there and try and jam it in a little crevice and then climb up it. And they call it a monkey fist because you just get a big knot of rope and it looks like a little monkey fist. Really, it should be called a baboon fist. Okay. The Thimba fist. Here we go. Big old bundle of knots. Like that. We'll throw it, see if we get it jammed in a little… rock crevice. Wow, that was close. Got it. Okay, so that's caught. And just pray like hell that that baboon fist holds. And then this jumar will allow me to go up the rope, but not fall back. Let's time it with the waves. Here we go. This surf is getting pretty bad. But the monkey fist is holding. Come on. Almost there. Come on. Never give up. Phew. Oh, look at the monkey fist right through there, the roots of this bush. Good job. Backpack off. Always important. Never go swimming wearing your backpack, 'cause it flips you onto your front. That's how people drown. Use your backpack as buoyancy. Okay, let's go. That water is very cold. I'll keep kicking across this inlet. I can feel that undertow. It is strong. It's just so hard to make any progress. The current's taking me out. I do not want to end up taken right out into that ocean… with the amount of sharks in this water. The sea is too powerful here! The more I try and fight this current, the less strength I have. If I keep this up, I'm just going to end up going under. We're going to have to use one of our smoke flares. I need some help. Okay. Bad decision. I got to wait for rescue. We failed to rescue Thimba this time. Remember, never try to swim against a rip current, especially with sharks in the water. Check it out. We just got word from the rangers. They think the power was cut on purpose. But why? And by whom? Okay, we've still got two urgent missions. What should we do next? We've got to restore the power by fixing that relay station in the gorge. And it looks like that storm is getting closer. But let's not forget about finding that loose lion. He's on the move and there are reports of an animal researcher working in the area. He might need our help. We failed to rescue Thimba this time. Remember, never try to fight the power of the sea. Check it out. We just got word that a herd of elephants is missing from the sanctuary. Could it be that whoever cut that power was after the elephants? That means poachers, so, we've got to hurry. They were last seen heading further north. We've got to find those elephants before the poachers do. Let's go. We failed to rescue Thimba this time. Remember, never try to fight the power of the sea. Check it out. We just got word from the rangers. They still don't know who cut the power, but they think it could be either poachers or hunters. But what are they after? Poachers hunt protected animals for their hides and tusks. Okay. Time to find that loose lion. He's on the move and there are reports of an animal researcher working in the area. He might need our help. Okay. Let's do this. We've got a lot of ground to cover and when you're on open savannah, one of the best ways to travel is on horseback. It's fast. It can go anywhere, which is great because we've got no idea where this lion could be. Definitely smoke over there. Huh. Looks like someone's camping there and it smells like they're cooking food. That's like ringing the dinner bell for this escaped lion. We need to get over there. Come on. Okay, I'm going to tie up my horse over here, where it's safe and also it's far away from the smell of that cooking food. Oh, man. It looks like we're too late. This camp has totally been destroyed. Look. Probably by the lion. Yeah. And that means it could still be nearby. Hold on, stand back. Stand back. Stand back. Stay back. - Hey! - Ow! Ow! Hello? Hello? All right. You're safe. Get out. Oh, I thought that was the lion. Heart rate through the roof. You all right, buddy? - Is the lion gone? Where is it? - The lion is gone. Okay, you've got to go that way. Horse, a few hundred meters straight through the trees there. Follow the ridgeline. Get yourself safe. - Thank you. - Yeah, keep going. Okay, now to find this lion. Okay, we're going to head this way. Come on. We failed to rescue Thimba this time. Man, that tide was strong. Thankfully, help came fast. But we can't say the same for Thimba. Check it out. We just got word from the rangers. They still don't know who cut the power, but they think it could be either poachers or hunters. But what are they after? Poachers hunt protected animals for their hides and tusks. So, we've got to restore the power in order to protect those animals. That means we must head into the gorge and fix that damaged hydroelectric relay station. Are you ready? Let's do this. We failed to rescue Thimba this time. Remember, never try to swim against a rip current, especially with sharks in the water. Check it out. We just got word that a herd of elephants is missing from the sanctuary. Could it be that whoever cut that power was after the elephants? That means poachers, so, we've got to hurry. They were last seen heading further north. We've got to find those elephants before the poachers do. Okay, no time for any breaks. Let's go. So, we're heading to the last place that the elephants were spotted… to try and find them. We're pretty far out, but we're not going to give up. Those elephants need help. Look. Yeah, wow, look at the size of that. If there's dung this size… there's elephants around. Okay. Wow, look, elephant dung here. Looks like they're moving this way. Okay. Oh, yeah. Look at that. There are the elephants. Oh, just so beautiful. Majestic and very big. Oh, no. Look, there's a vehicle moving fast. That could well be the poachers. Oh, no. Not another lion. Not again! Oh, this side's locked! Either we go up this tree, or go under the truck? Or do we run for those bushes? The lion's getting closer! Come on, better hurry! Tree, truck, or bushes? To the tree! Aw! There's no getting out of this one. It's going to be a rescue situation. Time to pop the smoke. Get the rangers in. Get some help. And we'll try this one again. We failed to save the elephants this time. Remember, the wild can be unpredictable. So, you've always got to have a backup plan. We've got to find those elephants before the poachers do. Okay. This is a tough call. One more try to save those elephants, or should we start over? There are many ways to take on this adventure and who knows what we've missed. Let's try again and make different decisions. He's just around the corner. So, it looks like he's scrounging around for food. I'm going to use these figs to try and lure him in. Okay, we're going to dig a little pit here, put the figs in it and make a slip knot. And then, hopefully, Thimba will come along, reach down and grab the figs. Baboons are smart, but they're also greedy. And then, when he reaches down, I can pull that slip knot, catch his hand, get him, get him back to the reserve, get him safe. Okay, we're going to dig it here. Okay, so pretend my finger is Thimba's arm. And once the snare's in place, pull the line tight. The great thing about slip knots is once they're tightened, they're not going to loosen. Okay, so that's the snare. Okay, now to be patient and wait. Thimba. Go on, eat. We got him. Hey, Thimba, calm down. Here you go, have a fig. There you go. Hey, guys. Got you loud and clear, Bear. Go ahead. So, Thimba is happy, eating figs. You can come and collect him from this cave. That's great news. Well done. We're sending the chopper to pick you and Thimba up right now. Roger that. Nice work rescuing Thimba. Mission accomplished. Hang on. We just got word that a herd of elephants is missing from the sanctuary. Could it be that whoever cut that power was after the elephants? That means poachers, so, we've got to hurry. They were last seen heading further north. We've got to find those elephants before the poachers do. Let's go. Nice work rescuing Thimba. Mission accomplished. The rangers still don't know who cut the power, but they think it could be either poachers or hunters. But what are they after? Poachers hunt protected animals for their hides and tusks. Okay. Time to find that loose lion. He's on the move and there are reports of an animal researcher working in the area. He might need our help. We've got to move fast. Nice work rescuing Thimba. Mission accomplished. The rangers still don't know who cut the power, but they think it could be either poachers or hunters. But what are they after? Poachers hunt protected animals for their hides and tusks. So, we've got to restore the power in order to protect those animals. That means we must head into the gorge and fix that damaged hydroelectric relay station. Are you ready? Let's do this. To the tree! There's no getting out of this one. Remember, lions can climb trees. It's going to be a rescue situation. I just hope that the rangers get here quick. Are you trying to kill me? Great plan. Oh, boy. This is going to be a jump. That worked! Just remember, never give up... Oh… crazy dream. Okay. Oh, no! This one we get to try again. Okay. Under the truck? Or up the tree? But definitely, not the bush again. The lion's getting closer now. Tree or go under the truck? Okay. We're probably about 150 meters away here. I can see the camp. Now, the key is just no sudden movements. Sudden, fast movements will catch the attention of a big cat. And also make sure you're downwind. Yeah, which is good. Camp's in that direction. My scent will carry on the wind. And if I was upwind of it, the smell would just float over that camp and the lion would smell me just like that. But from downwind… we've got some chance of doing this. And when you move… Now, be really careful when you move, so, you haven't got a heavy footfall. You're not breaking a lot of twigs. The way to do it is just put the side of the foot down. Roll it, nice and quietly. Yeah, look, the lion's the other side of the tent now. And I'm going to crawl up. Try and get the researcher out and back. It's going to need a knife. - Hey. Who are you? - Hey, shh! It's okay. I'm here to help you. We need to get you out of here. Okay… I've got a horse about 200 meters that way. - Okay. - Get you on that. Head towards the reserve. All right? Don't stop. Go now. Look, the lion's headed off into the bushes. Well, at least the researcher's now safe. But… how to now find that lion again? Okay. Come on. I just wonder if I can make, like, a natural kraal out of some of these bushes around here. Remember that boma we built earlier? Normally, you use bomas to keep lions out. But because it's like a kraal, if I can get that lion to come in and then close it off, that will effectively trap the lion. And then we can relocate him back to the reserve. Hundred meters away, I reckon we can lure him back here. Either we use some of that meat from the carcass, set a trail and try and hope that the lion will follow it in, we can close off the entrance. Or we go for the live bait option and I use myself as that bait and try and entice and get that lion to chase me, run in and then shut the entrance off. Being the bait will definitely get his attention, but it's risky. Two options. What do you reckon? Should we be the bait? Or should we use the meat to try and lure that lion in? I just wonder if I can make, like, a natural kraal out of some of these bushes around here. Remember that boma we talked about earlier? Normally, what you use a boma for is to protect a camp. You put lots of thorny bushes and branches around your camp and it keeps predators out. But you could also use it… to keep a predator in. All we've got to do is figure out how to get the lion, lure it in and then close-off that entrance. And then we can relocate him back to the reserve. Hundred meters away. I reckon we could lure him back here. Either we use some of that meat from the carcass, set a trail and try and hope that the lion will follow it in, we can close off the entrance. Or we go for the live bait option and I use myself as that bait and try and entice and get that lion to chase me, run in and then shut the entrance off. Being the bait will definitely get his attention, but it's risky. Two options. What do you reckon? Should we be the bait? Or should we use the meat to try and lure that lion in? Yeah, he's not moving now. Okay, so I'm going to be the bait. Oh, boy. First, we need to build this boma. Okay, come on. You use a bunch of these branches. Put thorny ones lower down here to really stop the lion getting out and then these bushes are just all intertwined to make a barrier. Then once the lion's in there, all I've got to do is drop it into place… like this. Okay. Now to try and go and lure the lion in. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Want something to eat? Look at this. Come on! Come on! Come on! The lion's not taking any notice at the moment. Maybe if I limp. You know, in the wild, if you're vulnerable and you're weak and you've got an injury, that's always a trigger to a predator that there's a potential meal on the horizon. Maybe I just need to play more injured. Look, that's got his attention. He's on his feet. Ah! My leg! Ah! I'll be a delicious lunch. Come on! Oh, here we go! Okay, now get over the fence. Okay, let's get that door closed. One lion contained. Now what we've got to get the rangers in. They can relocate him back to the reserve. Phew! Good job. Heart thumping. Mission successful. Phew! Nice work finding and capturing that lion. Mission accomplished. The rangers still don't know who cut the power, but they think it could be either poachers or hunters. But what are they after? Poachers hunt protected animals for their hides and tusks. So, we've got to restore the power in order to protect those animals. That means we must head into the gorge and fix that damaged hydroelectric relay station. Are you ready? Let's do this. We failed to capture the lion this time. Remember, never try to outsmart a hungry lion. Hang on. We just got word that a herd of elephants is missing from the sanctuary. Could it be that whoever cut that power was after the elephants? That means poachers, so, we've got to hurry. They were last seen heading further north. We've got to find those elephants before the poachers do. Let's go. We failed to capture the lion this time. Never try to outsmart a hungry lion. Check it out. We just got word from the rangers. They think the power was cut on purpose. But why? And by whom? Okay. We've still got two urgent missions. What should we do next? We've got to restore the power by fixing that electrical relay station in the gorge and it looks like that storm is getting closer. And let's not forget about rescuing Thimba the baboon. He was last seen on the coast, where a wild cheetah was also spotted. Thimba could be in danger. This chopper is going to take me to where Thimba was last spotted, but it's difficult terrain down there. This is the Horn of Africa, some of the most dangerous seas in the whole world. Powerful currents, huge waves, and sea full of great white sharks. Our priority is to get down there and pick up the trail of Thimba. But there is no way that the chopper is going to be able to land. So, I'm going to use a technique that the Special Forces use. It's called fast-roping. A little bit closer. Okay. I'm good here. Chopper gone. Down on the ground. Now to find Thimba. Come on. Oh, look, some fruit. These are edible. Look, num-num berry. They actually taste good. We failed to capture the lion this time. Remember, the wild can be unpredictable and so can a hungry lion. The rangers still don't know who cut the power, but they think it could be either poachers or hunters. But what are they after? Poachers hunt protected animals for their hides and tusks. Okay, time to rescue Thimba. He was last seen on the coast, where a wild cheetah was also spotted. Thimba could be in danger. Are you ready? Let's do this. We failed to capture the lion this time. Remember, the wild can be unpredictable and so can a hungry lion. Hang on. We just got word that a herd of elephants is missing from the sanctuary. Could it be that whoever cut that power was after the elephants? That means poachers, so, we've got to hurry. They were last seen heading further north. Okay, no time for a break. We've got to try and save those elephants. Let's go. Nice work finding and capturing that lion. Mission accomplished. Hang on. We just got word that a herd of elephants is missing from the sanctuary. Could it be that whoever cut that power was after the elephants? That means poachers, so, we've got to hurry. They were last seen heading further north.

We've got to restore the power by fixing that electrical relay station in the gorge and it looks like that storm is getting closer. And let's not forget about rescuing Thimba the baboon. He was last spotted on the coast, near those dangerous sea cliffs, and Thimba could get hurt. Nice work finding and capturing that lion. Mission accomplished. The rangers still don't know who cut the power, but they think it could be either poachers or hunters. But what are they after? Poachers hunt protected animals for their hides and tusks. Okay, time to rescue Thimba. He was last seen on the coast, where a wild cheetah was also spotted. Thimba could be in danger. Are you ready? Let's do this. Ugh, it keeps trying… It keeps trying to stick on to the inside of my mouth. No. There's nothing like having a leech stuck in your throat to… kill your appetite. I'm going to leave that leech there. Okay, keep moving. Okay. Actually, look. He's releasing. Look. Phew! There he goes. Boas can hold their breath for a long time, but the shock of being thrust underwater forced him to release me. Ugh… I hate snakes. Between the leeches and the snakes, I'm taking a beating. Luckily, we've traveled several miles and are getting much closer to that damaged electrical relay station, so, keep your eyes peeled. Oh, look, here's a wire. Yeah, look. Big, thick electrical cable. That is going to go to the relay station. Where's that going? Oh, it's running up here. Let's follow this. Yeah, look. Here we go. It's a relay station and the fuse box. Look at these wires. You know, that's not an animal. That's intentionally been severed. Hm… This confirms that the poachers cut the power on purpose. You know, why would they do this? Okay, we need to get this power back on, so no more animals can escape. Okay, before we start messing around with live wires, make sure the power is 100% shut off. This red switch is the power. Down is the off position. Off. Yep. Okay. So, I'm reconnecting the severed pieces of wire, so, then the electricity could just flow back through. Okay, now what we need to know is the fuse sequence… and then, hopefully, power is reinstated. Okay, so, three switches. These blue switches operate the terminals. Each one can be either negative, or positive. So if the switch is down, it's negative. If the switch is up, it's positive. They told me over the radio the sequence. N-P-N… or P-N-P. Was it negative, positive, negative? Or was it positive, negative, positive? There was a phrase. How do I remember it? Panthers… Panthers… No... Okay, what was the correct sequence? Think, Bear, think. I sure hope you've remembered it. "Panthers never prowl." P, positive. Never, negative. Prowl, positive. And now to flick that master switch. Here we go, moment of truth. Was it "Panthers never prowl"? Here we go. Oh! Oh, no. That is not the right one. It was not "Panthers never prowl". Should've known that. Panthers do prowl. This box is done. This is a job for the engineers. At this stage, we'll never get the power back up on our own. Let's just hope no more animals have gone missing. We failed to restore the power this time. We've got to remember the correct sequence before we try that again. Hang on. We just got word that a herd of elephants is missing from the sanctuary. Could it be that whoever cut that power was after the elephants? That means poachers, so, we've got to hurry. They were last seen heading further north. We've got to find those elephants before the poachers do. Let's go. We failed to restore the power this time. Remember, never try to out-muscle a boa constrictor. We just got word from the rangers. They think the power was cut on purpose. But why? And by whom? Turns out one of the rangers spotted a military-type truck near that gorge earlier. That, to me, sounds suspicious. I wonder who it could be. Now the rangers are investigating. In the meantime, we've still got two urgent missions. Okay. What should we do next? That loose lion is on the move and there are reports of an animal researcher working in the area. He might need our help. And let's not forget about rescuing Thimba the baboon. He was last seen on the coast, where a wild cheetah was also spotted. Thimba could be in danger. We failed to restore the power this time. Remember, never try to wrestle a boa constrictor. The rangers still don't know who cut the power, but they think it could be either poachers or hunters. But what are they after? Poachers hunt protected animals for their hides and tusks. Okay, time to rescue Thimba. He was spotted on the beach near dangerous sea cliffs. We need to bring him home to the sanctuary before he gets hurt. Are you ready? Let's do this. We failed to restore the power this time. Remember, never try to out-muscle a boa constrictor. The rangers still don't know who cut the power, but they think it could be either poachers or hunters.

We've got to try and save those elephants. Let's go. Yeah, look. Here we go. It's a relay station and the fuse box. Look at these wires. Hm. You know, looks like someone has just cut these wires on purpose. But, you know, why would they do this? Okay, we need to get this power back on, so no more animals can escape.

Each one can be either negative or positive. So, if the switch is down, it's negative. If the switch is up, it's positive. They told me over the radio the sequence. N-P-N… or P-N-P. Was it negative, positive, negative? Or was it positive, negative, positive? There was a phrase. How do I remember it? Panthers… Panthers… no... Okay, what was the correct sequence? Think, Bear, think. I sure hope you've remembered it. "No panthers… in Nigeria." N-P-N. Definitely. Negative… …positive, negative. And now to flick that master switch. Here we go. The power is back on and that's going to protect the animals down here. Good job. "No panthers in Nigeria", but power in the relay box. Okay, let's get out of here. The rangers were excited to hear the power is back on. Mission accomplished. Nice work. Hang on. We just got word that a herd of elephants is missing from the sanctuary. Could it be that whoever cut that power was after the elephants? That means poachers, so, we've got to hurry. They were last seen heading further north. We've got to find those elephants before the poachers do. Let's go. We failed to restore the power this time. We've got to remember the correct sequence before we try that again. The rangers are going to look into who cut the power. In the meantime, we've still got two urgent missions. Okay. What should we do next? That loose lion is on the move and there are reports of an animal researcher working in the area. He might need our help. And let's not forget about rescuing Thimba the baboon. He was last spotted on the coast, near those dangerous sea cliffs. And Thimba could get hurt. We failed to restore the power this time. We've got to remember the correct sequence before we try that again. The rangers still don't know who cut the power, but they think it could be either poachers or hunters. But what are they after? Poachers hunt protected animals for their hides and tusks. Okay, time to rescue Thimba. He was spotted on the beach, near dangerous sea cliffs. We need to bring him home to the sanctuary before he gets hurt. Are you ready? Let's do this. We failed to restore the power this time. We've got to remember the correct sequence before we try that again. The rangers still don't know who cut the power, but they think it could be either poachers or hunters. But what are they after?

In the meantime, we've still got two urgent missions. Okay. What should we do next? That loose lion is on the move and there are reports of an animal researcher working in the area. He might need our help. And let's not forget about rescuing Thimba the baboon. He was last spotted on the coast, near those dangerous sea cliffs. And Thimba could get hurt.

The rangers still don't know who cut the power, but they think it could be either poachers or hunters. But what are they after? Poachers hunt protected animals for their hides and tusks. If there's poachers in the area, I'm glad we restored power to that protective fence. Okay, time to find that loose lion. He's on the move and there are reports of an animal researcher working in the area. He might need our help. We've got to move fast. This is going to be physical, not one to get wrong. Let's go. Oh, this is hard. That is a long drop. Okay. Keep hauling. Got to keep the legs up… to take my weight, and then haul with the hands. Haul with the hands. Keep pulling. Keep pulling. Come on. Come on. Never… give… up. Almost there, last bit. Come on. Keep pulling. Keep pulling. Come on. Oh, boy. That was hard work. Wow. It's amazing the strength you can find when there's no choice. Okay. Get moving. Try and reach those elephants, pronto. There are the elephants there. Come on! Poachers. And what they want… are the elephants. Okay, so we've found the elephants, which is good. If we can get them down to the watering hole now, hidden by these bushes and all of this scrub and hopefully, the poachers will stay on the road and the bushes and the terrain will hide the elephants. Let's get them right down there. Come on, guys. Here we go. Keep moving. Down to the water. Come on. Down to the water. Keep going. Come on. We need to get them down there fast and hide them from the poachers. Come on. Keep moving. Keep moving. Come on. Down to the water. Come on. Down to the water. Keep going. Come on. Come on. Keep moving. Keep going. Come on! Here we go. Shh! Trying to keep elephants quiet is not easy. Well done, the elephants. Good job. That's the poachers gone. And they didn't see us down here. Phew! Nice job. We've bought some time for the rangers to get down here and bring these elephants back safely to the sanctuary. And I, for one, feel pretty proud of what we've done and so should you. When you work hard to protect something vulnerable and beautiful, that's a great thing. You not only saved that family of elephants from poachers… but you also managed to track down and capture a lion. You rescued Thimba the baboon from all sorts of danger and you were able to restore power to the sanctuary's fence, so all the animals are protected. That means you've saved the day and the sanctuary. Nice work. But it all comes down to making good survival decisions. But sometimes, making good survival decisions, when you're under pressure, isn't easy, you know. But the more you practice it, being used to that pressure, being able to think calmly when it's all happening, that is a key part of life and survival. Your quick thinking and good decisions has helped these elephants. Well done. What a team. Here we go. Let's do this. Careful. This terrain's steep, now. Watch your step. Watch out for loose rocks. We're also losing the light now. We've got to move. We've got to hurry. Careful now. That's the bottom of the canyon and now to start up. This is going to be physical. Inch by inch, come on. We use whatever we can here. Use a bit of the tree to start with. Oh, boy. There's a tricky bit here. Careful, now. A lot of this rock is pretty flaky. Ah, it's a dead end. Maybe there's a better route round to the right. I'm definitely running out of energy. Come on. This has just taken way too long. I'm never going to reach those elephants before dark. You know, never give up, but sometimes you're just out of time. And that means we're out of this fight. We failed to save the elephants this time. Trying to climb up the canyon was a mistake. If we'd done things in a different order, we might've got a different outcome. Want to give up… or go back and try to cross that line? This is a tough call. Only you decide where we go from here. What do you think? Remember my motto. Ha! You thought I was going to let you give up? Remember what we say: "We never give up!" Okay. Let's get across that line. We've got some elephants to save. This is going to be physical, not one to get wrong. Let's go. Oh, this is hard. That is a long drop. Okay. Keep hauling. Got to keep the legs up to take my weight… and then haul with the hands.

Your quick thinking and good decisions has helped these elephants. Well done. What a team. We saved those elephants from the poachers. Mission accomplished. Nice work. We still need to rescue Thimba, restore the power and find that lion. What do you think? Want to give it another shot? If we'd done things in a different order, we might've got a different outcome. There are many ways to take on this adventure and who knows what we've missed? Let's try again and make different decisions. Remember, never give up. We saved those elephants from the poachers. Mission accomplished. Nice work. And great job getting the power back on. And that lion is safe, back in the sanctuary. But I wonder how Thimba's doing and I hope he's not in trouble. What do you think? Should we fly back down to the coast and see if we can rescue Thimba? There are many ways to take on this adventure and who knows what we've missed? Let's try again and make different decisions. Remember, only you decide where we go from here. Never give up. We saved those elephants from the poachers. Nice work. Mission successful. You also found that lion and rescued Thimba. And now they're safe, back in the sanctuary. Way to go. But we still need to restore the power, so no more animals can get out. What do you think? Should we head back into that gorge and try to restore the power? There are many ways to take on this adventure and who knows what we've missed? Let's try again and make different decisions. Remember, only you decide where we go from here. Never give up. We saved those elephants from the poachers. Mission accomplished. Nice work. And great job getting the power back on. You also rescued Thimba. He's safe, back in the sanctuary. Way to go. But I wonder where that lion is. He was on the move and there could still be people in danger. What do you think? Should we saddle up and begin a new search to find that lion? There are many ways to take on this adventure and who knows what we've missed? Let's try again and make different decisions. Remember, only you decide where we go from here. Never give up. We saved those elephants from the poachers. Nice work. Mission successful.
