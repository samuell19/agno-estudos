Hey, honey, it's me. Yeah, it's perfect. You're gonna love it. Okay, tell Maddy I said hi and have a safe flight. Love you guys. Bye. Jill, overnight this to the New York office, please? No problem. Mr. Drake, do you mind if I take off early? My wife and daughter just flew in. I've got the agent showing us that house in Cedar Shade. Cedar Shade! Congratulations. Well, let's see what my better half has to say before we pop the champagne. Of course, yeah, take all the time you need. And give my best to Rebecca. Thank you. Appreciate it. Whoa! Are you serious? - This could be our house? - Well, maybe. If you and your mother love it as much as I do. It looks a lot bigger than it did in the pictures. We're not in Manhattan anymore. No more shoeboxes, sweetie. Hi, Brian. Angela Chasen. You must be Rebecca. Yes, I am. Nice to meet you. Lovely to know you. Hello, princess. What's your name? Maddy. Do you live here? No, no, no. I'm just gonna try and help sell it. It's pretty, isn't it? That's an understatement. I really like the neighborhood. Right? Cedar Shade is very nice, very quiet and safe, very family oriented. And you're not gonna find another bargain for blocks. Excuse me. Beautiful day, isn't it? Sure is! And the neighbors are very friendly. I'd love to see the inside. Okay, here we are. Four-thousand square feet. Two levels. Open floor plan, just as you requested. Dad, our entire New York apartment could practically fit in this one room. Now you can see why I've been wanting us to make this move. Yeah, but can we really afford this? It's one of the only foreclosures on the market. Okay, everyone, follow me this way. Rebecca, you've got to see the kitchen. This is just a chef's dream. Counter space and cabinets for days. Wow. It is fantastic. We've barely had any room to microwave frozen dinners. Ice cube, anyone? Oh, Maddy. More for me, I guess. Wait till you see the pool. There's a pool? - There's a pool. - There's a pool! Maddy! Maddy, be careful! We'll sign her up for swim lessons. Don't worry. Sacred Heart is the best school in the district, and it's walking distance. Oh! Well, that is convenient. So, sweetie, what do you think? I think that this all happened really quickly, but I think it's perfect. You're not gonna find a better deal, and the bank is very motivated to sell. Oh, really? How long has it been vacant? Several years. But as you can see, they put a lot of money into fixing it up. And I'll be honest with you. There's another offer. Oh, really? But I don't know how much liquidity that other buyer has, so it might not take much to push your offer over the top, if you know what I mean. - Let's do it. - All right, we'll take it. Excellent, excellent. All right, I will email you the documents later on today. You E-sign them, shoot them back to me, and I'll expedite your escrow process so you can move into your new house as soon as possible. - Thank you so much. - Congratulations. - Thank you, Angela. - My pleasure. And you, Maddy, you enjoy that pool. - I will. - All right. Bye-bye. - Thank you, thank you. - My pleasure. Oh, my gosh. Group hug, guys. - What do you think? - I like it. Yeah, this is kitchen. What's the bottom one say? - Garage? - That's the dining room. Okay, and what about that one over there? Dishes? Kitchen? - Here, Dad. - Thank you, honey. If we can just get these boxes where they belong, that would be really helpful. - Good morning! - Oh, good morning. I'm Lana, and this is Jeff. We're the Cranfields. We live just across the street in that one right there. Okay, hi, I'm Rebecca, and this is my husband Brian and our daughter Maddy. We were curious about who bought the house. You guys have picked a lovely street to live on, and your house is amazing. We did get very lucky. Hey, do you like wine and tapas? Yeah. A few of the neighborhood gals get together for a "girls night in," the first Monday of every month, and I insist that you come. Okay. But ladies only. Oh, I'm staying out of it. Hey, are you a golfer, Brian? Yeah. We're from Manhattan, so I didn't get a chance to do it much out there, but I hope to do it more out here. Dibs on driving the golf cart. I drove one once in Connecticut. On her father's lap, of course. Well, that still counts. Well, listen, once we get settled in, we would love to have you guys over for a housewarming drink. Make it a potluck, and I'll invite a few neighbors that you guys will enjoy meeting. - Sure, that sounds like fun. - Yeah. - Great. - Mom, I'm hungry. - Yeah, me, too. - Well, that's my cue. It was really a pleasure meeting you. Yeah, thanks for dropping by and saying hey. And if you need anything, just holler. - Thank you! - Let's go, kiddo. Well, they seem like great neighbors. Yeah. I think we hit this one out of the park. Oh, honey, can you make mine to go? I got a big meeting at the office. Really? I mean, today of all days? I'll be back in a couple hours. - All right. - Thank you. - Love you. - Love you. Bye, Dad. Mom? Yes? You know how you said if we ever got a house that I could have a lemonade stand? Can we just move in before we launch a new business? Please? It's the last day before school starts. All right, all right. Let's do this, okay? Been a long time since we had a lemonade stand in the neighborhood. Between you and me, yours is better. - Thanks. - Well, have a cookie. Ooh, maybe just one for later. Oh, how much do I owe you? A dollar, please. Here you are, sweetie. I'm Ellen, by the way. I live right over there, second house from the corner. Hi, Ellen. I'm Rebecca, and this is my daughter Maddy. Pleasure meeting you. Well, I'd better get back to walking my new hip. - Good luck with that. - Hi, Ellen. Lana. I see you've met Ellen. Oh, yeah, she seems really nice. And a more than a little nosy. So how's business? You just missed the mad rush. Good, then no waiting in line. This is so cute. We'll take two glasses. Just what the doctor ordered. By the way, this is my friend Kathleen. Hi. Hi. Welcome to the neighborhood. Thanks. You look so familiar. I was jogging by when you were looking at the house a few weeks ago. That's right, yeah. Kathleen's a personal trainer. Guilty as charged. I owe my waistline to her. But those cookies look so good, I might have to cheat a little. Yeah, if you wanna do another five laps around the block. Maybe not. This operation you got going on here is very impressive. Thank you. I do it all for charity. Oh, really? What one? Me. Every time a new phone comes out, Maddy can't wait for the update. But with moving and everything, we're prioritizing our expenses, so... So I have to take matters into my own hands. - Good for you. - When do you start school? - Tomorrow. - We could get used to this. You might have to hire staff to make it go year-round. Maybe after-school hours, if Mom will let me. - Count me in as a regular. - Yeah, me too. I'll bring all my clients when we're jogging by. - They're gonna love it. - Can I, Mom? Well, we'll see, okay? Your daughter's a delight. You must be very pleased. I am. Here. Keep the change. Thank you. Okay, Wonder Woman, back to work. - She's relentless. - Yeah, I can see. I may need to borrow some of that motivation after we get settled in. I thought you'd never ask. "Personal trainer-slash- drill sergeant." That's intimidating. - No pain, no gain. - Thank you. If you and your husband are available on Saturday, how about that potluck housewarming party? - Am I invited? - Yeah, the more the merrier. Well, I have to check with Brian 'cause he may be working. Oh, no. I won't take no for an answer. - Give me your phone. - What? I am putting in my number in, so you can reach me later. Well, that's really helpful. There. No lame excuses. Promise? I promise. - Bye. - Bye. Well, that was beyond the call of duty, huh? I'll say. Lucky. Mr. Aspinwall, this building combines state-of-the-art solar energy, geothermal heating and cooling, LED lighting, you name it. Your environmental footprint will be reduced to practically nothing. Not to mention your operating costs. That's good because I have some very tough investors this time around. Some of them are perfectly happy with going green, but a lot of them are balking at the initial expense. Sounds like Washington. How can I guarantee that the long-term operating costs are going to be low enough to offset their initial investment? Brian's designs have proven themselves thoroughly back east. Expectations and profits have lived up to every single client's satisfaction. Talk to any of them. The references are all in the prospectus. Well, if the figures on your previous projects check out, then we have a deal. Thank you, sir. - We won't let you down. - I'm sure you won't. Listen, I'm gonna have my lawyer talk to your lawyer, and then we'll put your deal to bed. Nice work. Thank you, sir. I worked very hard on it. I'll walk you out. - Hey, hon, what's up? - Hey! So remember that potluck party our neighbor mentioned? Mentioned or threatened? - How's Saturday afternoon? - Oh. Sounds fun. I don't know. I'm gonna have to clean up the living room. I wasn't expecting to be entertaining this early. I know, but we have to start meeting people. We're not gonna make any new friends by giving them the cold shoulder, right? I guess you're right. Well, what would you like your tirelessly supportive wife to cook you for dinner tonight? Actually, I was thinking maybe we could go out and celebrate. Celebrate? What are we celebrating? The client just signed off on my new building. No! That's fantastic! Yay! See? Our move is already paying off. I am so proud of you, honey. That's amazing. Thanks. Can we go early? Maddy's does have school tomorrow. Yeah, okay, I'll make reservations for 6:00. Okay, all right, sounds good. Love you. Love you too. Yeah, okay, all right, three more. One... You got this. You want it? Ah! Rebecca, hey. Hey. Is everything okay? Fine. Just getting tortured over here. Well, I just wanted to touch base about Saturday. How's 3:00? Perfect. Leave everything to me. That is so sweet of you. Thank you. Oh, honey, any excuse for a party. All right, great. Then I'll see you Saturday. Bye. I don't know about you, but I am in desperate need of some H20. Yeah, sure. Then he says if the figures check out, we have a deal, you should have seen Mr. Drake's face. That is awesome. It sounds like the West Coast branch has themselves a new golden boy. They'll be putting your name on the letterhead before too long. Yeah, let's not get too carried away. But it's definitely a good start. I'm so proud of you. I just have one question. After the money starts rolling in, do you think that maybe... we could think about having another child like we always wanted? Honey, there is nothing I want more than for Maddy to have a little brother and sister. That's what this is all about. I know, but she might not want to give up the spotlight. I heard that. Crying, changing diapers, what's not to like? Uh-huh. You ready to head out for dinner? Yeah. Yes, I am starving. Who's that? I don't know. - I'll see who it is. - All right. Pizza delivery. I think you're mistaken. We didn't order any pizza. This is 18300 Sheffield Lane, right? It is, yeah. Rebecca Lassiter, 555-1986. Yeah, that's my wife, but I'm sure she didn't order any pizza. Look, you better ask her because her name's on here. Hey, what's going on? - Did you order any pizza? - No. Five supreme pizzas with extra anchovies? Mm-mm, no, sorry. Maddy? Don't look at me. I hate anchovies. Everybody hates anchovies. Just pick 'em off. You owe me 57.23, plus tip. That's not our order though. Do I need to call my boss? All right, you know what? We'll take 'em. What? Why? Well, mistakes happen, and we don't want to be on their bad side if we actually do decide to order pizza from them. Thank you. Well, at least we'll have some leftover pizza for the potluck tomorrow. Now what? Oh, boy. 42.50, please? You gotta be kidding me. I didn't order any Chinese food. Is this correct? Yeah, it is. 42.50, please. - No way! - What is going on? I don't know. Obviously we're being pranked. You know what? I gave Lana my number. I bet she ordered all this for the potluck Saturday, and they just got the delivery date wrong. I'm gonna call her. Rebecca, hey. Hey, we're getting all these deliveries: pizza, Chinese. I'm curious. Did you order these for tomorrow's party? Wow, that's odd. Well, I can assure you it wasn't me. I would never order takeout for a potluck. As a matter of fact, at this very moment, I am preparing my world-famous pigs in a blanket from scratch. That sounds good. I can't wait to taste those. Well, I hope you solve the mystery. Bye. Bye. Uh-uh. No clue. Hmm. Well, I don't know about you guys, but I'm starving for some kung pao pepperoni. - Ew! - With anchovies? We can pick off the anchovies. - Here. - Mmm. - All right. You ready? - Yep. - You nervous? - Maybe. That's all right. - Hi. - Welcome to Sacred Hearts. I'm Miss Lainer. - Hi, I'm Rebecca. - Hi. - This is my daughter Maddy. - Hi, Maddy. You ready to make a bunch of new friends? I'm a little nervous, but I'll get over it. I like your attitude, and the kids will too. - Let's go meet them. - Okay. I'll pick you up after school, okay? - Okay. Bye. - Bye, sweetie. - Love you. - Love you too. Bye. So how are you feeling today? Um, sometimes I feel like I'm drowning, like I'm lost in this fog and I can't get out of it. It's understandable, Kathleen. The death of a parent is always traumatic, and being your relationship with your mother was so difficult after the divorce, it's only natural that your feeling of loss is amplified. Yeah, I suppose. And you said that it had been ten years since you last spoke. Yeah, at least. I was still in junior high when my dad and I moved away. I always kinda thought we would all go back. But you know, as soon as the house got sold, I knew that it was finally over. How does it feel returning to Cedar Shade after all this time? It feels good, actually, you know? Cedar Shade was the last place I remember my parents and I being happy. How about your work? That's going well. I have a great pool of clients, and I keep adding new people all the time. Sometimes I think it's the only thing that's keeping me sane. The work? Helping people achieve their goals. I'm glad to hear it. You're helping people get their bodies into shape. Well, think of me as your trainer. I'm helping you get your mind back in shape. Clinical depression is manageable. I just don't wanna take any kind of medication. And no one is going to make you to take any. However, I'm guessing you recommend special diets, supplements to your clients sometimes, don't you? Yes. That's all I'm doing. It's just a suggestion, food for thought, okay? I want you to focus on the positive memories, not the negative ones. Yeah, no, of course not. So there's my ball, sitting on a log, smack dab in the middle of a damn pond. So what'd you do? I dropped my pants, waded over to the log, and took a whack at it. I was so embarrassed... until he landed the ball on the green. It was do or die. - Did you win? - Technically, yes. But he got suspended from the Cedar Shade Country Club for indecent exposure. - Are we expecting anyone else? - Not that I know of. Maybe it's five more pizzas with anchovies. All right, that's not funny. Go, Brian. I'll get it. This the Lassiter residence? Whoa, uh, excuse me, can I help you? You should have been notified by phone to have the premises evacuated. By phone? What are you talking about? - The rats. - That's ridiculous. We just moved in, and we had the house inspected. The phone call we got indicated a significant infestation. Well, obviously there's been a mistake. No one here called you. We just want to do our job, pal, all right? Look, this is some kind of bad joke. We don't have rats and... You don't have any rats, huh? You know what? Don't worry about it, Brian. Everyone, how about we move across the street to our house, huh? No, guys. You don't understand. No, I mean, literally, this is just another prank. It's best that we let these gentlemen do what they need to. We'll be in touch. All right. Listen, honestly, I'm so sorry. - I'm sorry. - Mm-hmm. I'm sorry. We're gonna start in the attic. Just do what you have to. - This is ridiculous. - I know, honey. We'll figure it out, okay? We'll figure it out. Do I know you? There's something familiar about your eyes. I get that a lot. Mommy! Daddy! - Mommy! - Maddy? Go! Go! What happened? The rock came through the window! What? It's okay. It's okay. Don't cry. You're with us. It's okay, baby, all right? This could've really hurt her. Look at this! - I know, I know. - It's all right, babe. This has gone too far. I'm calling the police. Hey, sweetheart, sweetheart, it's okay, babe. Listen, it's okay, it's okay. Mom's here. And then finally, the rock through the window. Okay, rock. So that's four incidents in just two nights, right? Yeah. At first we thought they were meant for someone else. It's pretty clear someone's targeting us. Well, do you suspect someone who might be responsible? Do you have any enemies? We haven't been here long enough to make friends, let alone enemies. How about your daughter? Has she met or seen any kids in the neighborhood who might be troublemakers? No. I've asked her. She's barely met the kids at school. Hmm. So what's next? Well, I don't want to be discouraging, but you haven't given me a lot to go on. Surely there's something you can do. Well, I'll call this exterminating company and these two restaurants, see if I can trace those calls. That's it? There are just misdemeanors. My guess is it's kids picking on the new neighbors. That rock could have injured or even killed our daughter. I understand, but the department doesn't have the resources to dedicate to pranks. You gotta put yourself in our shoes, Detective Carter. We don't have anywhere else to turn. There's gotta be something you can do. I'm sorry. I'll do the best I can. In the meantime, if anything else out of the ordinary happens, here's my card. My direct number is on there. Yeah, well, I'll let myself out. Thanks. Good night. So now what? Let's just go back to bed. Maddy can sleep with us tonight. That kinda goes without saying. Pick you up after school! Looks like our kids are hitting it off great. I'm so relieved Maddy's already made a friend. It has been a rough couple days, let me tell you. If you're not in a hurry, maybe we could grab a coffee. Yeah, sure. What's going on? Someone threw a rock through Maddy's window Saturday night. - You're joking. - No. - Was anyone hurt? - No, she's fine, thank God. Come on, let's go. Okay. Hey, hon, you home? I forgot my cell phone. Hey, Mr. Drake, you called? Yes, sir. I'll have that completed before the meeting this afternoon. All right. Yeah, I'll talk to you then. Well, if there's no other option, I can host next month's garden club meeting here. Doris, I think I hear that stray dog at the back door again. Let me call you back. How did that get open? I remember you. You never bought my lemonade. What? What are you doing in my house? You always hated me. Why? I don't know you. Yes, you do. I see the way that you look at me. It's the same way that you looked at my mother. You think that these new people, that they deserve this house? That my family, my mother, deserved to be kicked out? I don't know what you're talking about. You know that it's my house. You know that it belongs to me. Please. Say it! It's your house. It belongs to you. Just please don't hurt me. Don't worry, I won't. That's what the fall is for. I'm taking it back! You'll see. All right. Let's go, sweetie. Oh, my gosh. What happened? An accident. Apparently, she lost her balance and fell down the stairs. I was always so worried about her living alone - in that big house. - Come on. That is terrible. All right. Bye. Okay, easy, easy. Come on, let's go. All right, you're doing good, sweetie. Stick with it, okay? - Okay. - Hang tough. Hey, Debra, how are you? That's weird. What? What the hell? Mom, what's a peed-oh-pill? - Rebecca? - Yes. Can you come to my office, please? We really need to talk about this. Yeah, yeah. Go, Maddy, go to class. - Okay. - Go to class! Yeah? Mr. Drake would like to see you in his office right away. Okay, thanks. You wanted to see me? Brian, come on in. Shut the door. Have a seat. Is there a problem? Did you an ulterior motive for leaving New York? What are you talking about? Uh... That's... That's a mistake. You realize the position this puts me in. I can assure you, sir, that's not true. Is that why you wanted to be transferred out here? No, of course not. That's absurd. That may well be the case, however, I still have the reputation of my firm to think about. Mr. Drake... Therefore, Brian, I have no choice but to take you off of the Aspinwall project until we get to the bottom of this. Sir, I've been the lead on that project since it's inception! It means everything to me! You did extensive background checks when I was hired! You know that's not true! I'm sorry, but you have a morals clause in your contract. If new information comes to light, we must investigate. Brian, if Aspinwall gets a whiff of this, he's gonna drop us in a heartbeat. We can't afford the risk and neither can our clients. Unbelievable. You're gonna go back to being a junior draftsman until we can figure this out. Now, if everything is as you say it is, then you'll be reinstated. We're done. I promise you this is gonna get cleared up. I certainly hope so. Well, someone is spreading lies that I'm a child molester. - If that were true... - It's not true. Let me finish. If you were convicted of child molestation, we would have a record of it. Well, apparently, it's under investigation. Okay, but still, charges like that have to be reported to Child Protection Services. I'll look into it. Whoever is out to get me isn't done, Detective. I want you to think very hard about who that might be. Maybe an employee at your firm or somebody back in New York? Honestly, I have no clue, period. These were posted all over the neighborhood today, and online, the neighborhood watch. Oh, and the principal of Maddy's school doesn't want you picking her up anymore. She's my daughter. This is getting really serious, Brian. You think I don't know that? Mr. Drake found out about these. I could lose my job over this. Just tell me you don't know anything about these accusations. How could you think that? I don't know what to think anymore. You don't mean that, Rebecca. You're the one who wanted us to move away from New York. All of a sudden, you just wanted us to move. We uprooted Maddy and I's lives, we left our friends. So now I'm asking you why. You know why. So that I'd have better opportunities at work, so that we could have a better life out here. How is that working out for you? That's not fair, Rebecca. You've seen what's happened the past few days. Each one gets worse than the last. Well, this is more serious than ordering pepperoni pizzas. Someone is out to get us! No! They're out to get you! Okay? When does this end? How far does this go? Are we gonna have to fear for our lives? No. I spoke to Detective Carter. - And? - He's gonna clear it up. And what about the next time and the time after that? - What are you getting at? - What are you not telling me? You can't possibly think this is true. I told you. I don't know what to think anymore. Is there some secret that's gonna be revealed about you, and I'm gonna be the last one to know? For God's sakes, no. Then what is going on? Detective Carter is gonna verify that the allegations are false, but we have to be patient, okay? It's gonna take some time. We can't turn on each other like this. No. Good luck with that. Rebecca! Hook, line, and sinker. - Wanna go to the mall with me? - Can we get some ice cream? Yeah, we sure can. Maybe see a movie. Stewart, the Singing Salamander? Sounds like a real Oscar contender. So why don't you go ahead and grab a table, and I'll get the ice cream, okay? Okay. Oh, don't forget, extra sprinkles. Okay. I'll be right back. Maddy? Maddy? Um, did you guys see a little girl? - Uh-uh. - No. Maddy! Maddy! Maddy! Maddy! Maddy, are you in here? I'm in here, Mom. Maddy, you should not have run off by yourself like that. You scared me half to death. I thought I'd be back before you even got to the table. Besides, I'm not alone. Wait, what? When I saw Maddy get up and head over here, I followed her just to make sure she'd be okay. Thank you. No problem. Crisis averted. It's just we've never been here before. I just had no idea where she would've wandered off to. I can imagine. Yeah, all right, well, you want to join us for ice cream? Sure, thanks. That sounds crazy. Who would do something like that? I hate to think the worst, but I fear there's something he's not telling me. What other explanation can there be? I just feel like I'm living with a stranger. Well, maybe you need to remind him why you fell in love in the first place. He just works all the time. Okay, do it after work. - Do you own any lingerie? - Kathleen... You don't want him to keep any secrets, you need to give him a reason not to. Trust me. It's certainly not something I'm gonna take care of now. Maddy and I are here to have a good time, aren't we? Yep. We're going to see a movie later. You wanna come? I'd love to, but I have a client I have to meet with. Oh, speaking of which, I was wondering if you had any time for an in-home training session tomorrow while Maddy's at school. Yeah, sure. We could do a 90-minute cardio bootcamp, maybe 12:30 to 2:00? How's that sound? Sounds horrific. All right, you're on. Oh, I really have to go. I have to meet a client in 20 minutes. I have some unexpected calories to burn off, thanks to you people. All right, thank you. - Sure. - Bye. - She's nice. - Yep. T this hour? Uh, Detective Carter. Oh. Hey. Mr. Lassiter? It's Detective Carter. I wanted to bring you up to speed. Great. We got you on speaker. Rebecca's here with me. - Hi. - What do have for us? Good news. I called Child Protection Services, and they have no record of you, so you're clean as a whistle. Would you mind informing my employer? And the principal at Maddy's school, please? Text me their info, and I'll get on that right away. - No worries. - Will do. Okay, so now the bad news. We traced the calls to the pizzeria, the Chinese restaurant, the exterminators, they all originated from disposable cell phones. Great. We'll track those purchases, but I wouldn't get my hopes up. Whoever did this knows how to cover their tracks. Well, we appreciate everything you're doing to help us. It's my job, and I need to get back to it, so if there's nothing more, I'll say good night. - All right, good night. - Good night. I just don't understand why they're doing this to us. I don't know. It's not like we did anything to anyone. Yeah. Who knows what's gonna happen next, baby. I don't know. I... I can just tell you that right now I just feel like relaxing and thinking about something else. Oh, yeah? Like what? Like us. Us, huh? Huh. Yeah. Brian, do you have something you want to tell me? What are you talking about? I-I just found a pair of panties in our bed. They're yours. No. You know these aren't mine. How'd they end up under the covers then? That's what I'm asking you, Brian. Wait a minute. You don't think... I don't think what? I just found a pair of panties in our bed! We're being set up again. Obviously. I'm being set up! You want me to think that someone snuck into this house and put a pair of panties in our bed? Someone planted the rat, remember? Oh, my God. Who... - Who is she, Brian? - Who? The bitch you've been sleeping with in our bed! I'm not sleeping with anyone, Rebecca! Just stop, Brian! Rebecca, please, come on. You know what? I'm done talking. I'm done. I just kinda think I'm done, okay? What does that mean? It means that we obviously need to spend some time apart to try to figure things out or not. All right, look, let's just talk about this like adults, okay? For Maddy's sake, if for nothing else. Don't bring our daughter into this, try to weasel your way out of it! Weaseling out? - Get out! Get out! - Honey! Pack some things now if you have to, and you can come back tomorrow while Maddy's at school. - Where am I supposed to go? - I don't know, Brian! I just can't look at you right now! Okay, baby. Don't. Just don't. "You promised me you were going to leave your wife." I guess the joke's on me. Maybe I should just tell everyone what you did. "Candice." Son of a bitch. - Hey! - Hi. You ready for a little bootcamp? Yeah, I guess as ready as I'll ever be. It's your first day. I'll go easy on you. Are you sure it wasn't just another prank? They were in our bed. Is possible someone else could have put them there? I have eyes. I knew something was wrong. I could feel it. There was the sudden move out to L.A., him always working late. I am so sorry, Rebecca. Truly I am. Yeah, well, it just all makes sense now. What makes sense? Candice, the jilted lover. Revenge for the promises Brian told her, the lies he told her. She's taking it out all on him, on us. It's been her all along. It has to be. Oh, my God, you're right. It all makes sense. All the pieces suddenly fit. Yeah. I just wish we never moved out here. We've had nothing but trouble and bad luck since the moment we arrived. You can't blame yourself. You didn't know. You couldn't have known. What am I supposed to do now? Did you kick him out? Yeah, for the time being. Then let him think about it. And then what? I suppose that depends on whether or not you can forgive him. I've been with him forever. I cannot imagine life without him. But the fact that someone so close to me could lead this secret life, I mean, it kills me. I don't know how I could've been so oblivious. But that's not entirely true, is it? You knew something was wrong. No, not really. Not until things started happening. And now this woman, she's jeopardized everything: our home, Maddy's school. All because, what, my husband can't keep it in his pants? I don't think things could ever go back to being the way they used to be. It's a shame. You just moved into this amazing house. Maybe I'm just gonna sell it. Move back east. So soon? What about Maddy? I know she just got adjusted to a new school, but I can't help but think this has all been a terrible mistake. I'm sure whatever is meant to be will happen exactly the way it should. Yeah, I guess. Well, thank you. Thanks for being here for me. Of course. Whatever I can do. Daddy! Hey, honey. When are you coming home? I don't know. I just wanted to hear your voice. We had cheese pizza for dinner. I wanted to save you some, but Mom said you already ate. That's okay, sweetie. I don't think I'll be home tonight. Hey, Maddy, who's on the phone? It's Daddy. Hey, give me the phone. What are you doing? I just wanted to call. All right, well, listen. Don't. But I didn't get to tell him good night. That's okay. Daddy told me to tell you good night, okay? Now let's go get ready for bed, okay? But Daddy always tells me good night. Oh, sweetie, it's gonna be okay, I promise. I promise, okay? Let's go. Now, did you do your homework? I asked you to bring in three mementoes from your childhood that we could discuss. I printed out three photographs. These are wonderful, Kathleen. That's my mom. She had the best laugh in the whole world. I can tell she adored you. That's the lemonade stand that she made me. It's adorable. I was so proud of it. And what does this one mean? Home. Yeah. We were so happy. It was before she started drinking, before the divorce, before my dad and I left. I should have kept in touch with her. When the bank took the house, she didn't have anywhere to go. She shouldn't have been alone in that facility. Well, we struck a chord. Yeah. Morning, sweetheart. Hi. Um... I just want to let you know that we're gonna be out of the house for the next two hours, so I suggest you use that time to come pick up your things. Rebecca, is this really necessary? Huh. I wonder if she could help me reason with Rebecca. Okay, you ready for some calisthenics? Do I have a choice? Okay, come on, lay down. Okay. I hate to gossip about our new neighbors, but did you hear that Rebecca kicked Brian out? Oh? Apparently, he's been having an affair with some woman since he came to L.A. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Rebecca found out. She told me all about it. Hmm. You don't seem surprised. Well, Rebecca told me too. She did? Yeah. I had training session with her the other day. Oh, you never mentioned it. You never asked. Well, now it makes sense. What makes sense? Your car. What about it? On Tuesday, I went to go get the mail, and I saw your car. Where? Parked across the street, right in front of Rebecca and Brian's house. I wasn't there on Tuesday, so that must have been somebody else's car. Kathleen, I know your car. I went in and looked right in the window, just to make sure. Rebecca had asked me if I'd seen any unusual cars parked on the block lately. What'd you tell her? Well, I told her that I hadn't, but if you're certain that it wasn't your car parked there on Tuesday, then maybe this woman that Brian's seeing, maybe her car looks just like yours. I doubt it. It must have been my car. I must have been there that day. Torturing Rebecca? Something like that. But on the other hand, maybe it wasn't your car parked there. Maybe it was this other woman's. I better tell Rebecca what I saw. That won't be happening. Really? Nobody likes a nosy neighbor. I miss Dad. When is he coming home? I don't know, honey. Eat your breakfast. I heard you guys fighting. I know you told him to go away. Why can't you tell him to come back? Because it doesn't work that way, Maddy. Sometimes when grownups have problems, they need to spend some time apart in order to work through those issues, okay? Daddy! Thank you for the teddy bear. I love him so much. I'm sitting in your chair here in the kitchen, keeping it warm just for you. That's sweet. I really appreciate that. - I'm glad you like him. - I do. Honey, let me talk to your mom, okay? Yeah, okay. Hold on. Mom? Yeah. Dad wants to talk to you. Thanks, babe. Yes? Brian? I told you not to do this. Why are you calling? I love you, Rebecca. You have to believe that. I wanna come home. Yeah, well, why don't you call Candice if you're so lonely? I already told you. I don't know who that is. And I already told you, you're the last person - I want to talk to right now. - It's my house too. Yeah, for now, okay? Are you eavesdropping again? Maddy, just go to your room. I hate you! Hey, Brian. I have you on speaker. Hey, Angela, I'm sorry to bother you. No bother. What's up? I have a question. How can I find out who owned the house before the bank foreclosed on it? Well, that's gonna require a bit of research at city hall. "Strickland." Where do I know that name from? So let's talk a little bit about your childhood house. The last time you were here, you said it was the only place that truly felt like home. Well, I tried to buy it back, but it didn't work out. Someone else got it. Really? I see. Did I say something wrong? You have to understand that sometimes to fix the pain of the past, you have to move forward. We have to move past it. But what if I don't want to move past it? Trying to recreate the past, it's a risky proposition. Well, it's a risk I'm willing to take. Besides, the current owners are gonna realize that it's not their dream house, and they're gonna move out. Why would they do that? Because it's not their house. It's my house. And sooner or later, they're gonna realize that. What have you been up to, Kathleen? What? Nothing. Just a few harmless pranks. Pranks? I like to think of it as nudging them. That's all. They're gonna be gone soon. Kathleen, okay, this is exactly the type of behavior that concerns me. No one was concerned when my mother got kicked out. - That was different. - Really? I fail to see how. And don't I deserve a chance at happiness for once? Of course, but harassing an innocent family is not the key to your happiness. I think that's really just a matter of perspective. I'm sorry. I can't condone this behavior. What is that supposed to mean? It means I can't treat you. Why? Because I actually have a chance at happiness? Because I don't want to be put in the difficult position of having to choose. Choose what, exactly? Whether or not to report you. What about doctor-patient confidentiality? There are exceptions, Kathleen. I follow your advice, and I try to reclaim the one place in my life where I'm truly happy, and now you want to have me arrested? Our time is up. No, Doctor. Your time is up. I finally have a chance to be happy, and you want to take that away from me? Who's the crazy one here? "Joy Strickland." "Only daughter Kathleen." Strickland. She never said anything about living in our house. Hello, Angela? Did you find the information you need? Hey, I remember you saying you got another offer on the house. Did it come from a woman named Kathleen Strickland? I'm not really at liberty to say. Please, it's important. Well, okay. You didn't hear it from me, but yes. That was the name, why? I have to call you back. Rebecca, please pick up. Come on. Now Maddy is giving me the silent treatment. She misses her dad. She blames me for this whole mess. I literally don't know what to do. Is that Brian? Yeah. I mean, should I get it? No. Nothing's changed. He's just trying to wear you down to take him back. All right. Hi, this is Rebecca. Please leave a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks! All right, I'm gonna go make some coffee. - You want some? - Sure. - All right, I'll be right back. - Yeah. Come on, come on. Rebecca. Rebecca, please don't hang up. Listen to what I have to say, please. I know you're mad, but listen. I know who's behind all this crazy stuff. It's your trainer Kathleen Strickland. Her mother lived in the house ages ago, but she lost it in a foreclosure, and Kathleen's been trying to get it back. She's the one behind the pranks and the accusations. Rebecca? Honey, I know you're there. I can hear you breathing. Kathleen, it's you, isn't it? This is Detective Carter. Leave a message after the beep. Come on. Detective, it's Brian Lassiter. I don't have time to explain, but there's something wrong at my house. Just get over there as quick as you can. I'm on my way now. Hey, how do you take your coffee? Pitch black. God. You scared me. Kathleen, um, are you okay? I'm fine. That's good. I forgot the napkins. Hi, this is Rebecca. Please leave a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Damn it! What's going on? No brain damage, huh? You're lucky. What happened? What happened? I'll tell you what happened. You and your husband ruined my life. That's what happened. What are you talking about? This is supposed to be my house, not yours! You ruined everything. The food, the exterminator, the rock. Oh, my God. You had people thinking Brian was a child molester. You had me thinking he was having an affair. Aren't you clever? Look, I'm sorry that it's come to this, but your husband stuck his nose where he shouldn't have. Well, you're not gonna get away with this. Yeah, we'll see about that 'cause he's on his way over here right now. No. And things will get really interesting. Kathleen. Kathleen, think about this. Oh, I have. Yeah. Crazy husband, he has an affair, jealous wife, murder-suicide. It's perfect. You're insane. My mother always said if you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say anything at all! Hello! Hello? Anybody home? Rebecca? Rebecca! Oh, God, Detective. Detective. Surprise. Where's my wife? She's a little tied up right now. Literally. Take me to her now! Don't tell me what to do in my house. - Your house? - That's right, Brian, my house. You're trespassing in my house. It may have been your house, but it's not your house anymore! You're not gonna get away with this! You know, she said the same thing. God, you two were meant for each other. - Rebecca! - She can't help you, Brian! Did you hurt her? She may have a bit of a headache, but no signs of a concussion. Kathleen, you have to stop this. No. You have to stop it. Just move out, and we'll leave this whole thing behind us. You killed Detective Carter. You're going to prison for this. It was self-defense! Detective Carter, Ellen, Lana, they all deserved to die! Kathleen, you need help. I'm not crazy, Brian! You cheated me out of this house on purpose. Nobody cheated you out of anything! This is crazy! Look, Kathleen, you can have the house, okay? That's what this is about. I'll sign it over to you! It's a little too late for that, don't you think? Hey, where do you think you're going, huh? Brian! Brian! You won't get away from me, Rebecca! I know every inch of this house! Open up! I know you're in there! I will break down this door if I have to! Got you, bitch! No! No! No! Come on, come here. Come on, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. It's over. She's dead. It's all right. Look at me. It's over. All right? She's dead. I usually charge a dollar, but since it's your first visit, it's on the house. Wow. Thanks. That's very nice of you. Well, see you later. - She's growing up so fast. - I know. You're not gonna make much money if you give it away. With scenery like that, who cares? Maddy! Well, I am sorry that I ever doubted you. It's in the past, babe. We have our whole future ahead of us in this house. - Yeah. - Our house. Kinda surprised we didn't pack it up and move. We fought for this place, and we won. We're not backing down now. I agree. You think it's time we tell her? Yeah. Maddy, come here a sec. We need to have a little talk. Come on. Sit down. If this is the talk about the birds and the bees, I'm not interested. Well, it kind of is, but it's probably not exactly what you're thinking. Are you guys finally gonna tell me that we're having a baby? How did you know? Yawn! I overheard you guys talking about it last week. Are there no secrets in this house? None that I know of. Yay.
