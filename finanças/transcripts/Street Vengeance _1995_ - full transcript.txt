(tense orchestra music) (slow dramatic music) (snorting) - Man, I wish I could. I just can't. - [Linda] That's good, Rick. - It's very good. - It's the price. I could cut this, cut it, cut it again. I still couldn't make my nut. - Are you saying I overcharge? - No, but I gotta make a living, man. - No, Rick. What you got to worry about is something much more basic. You gotta worry about how to stay alive. See, you haven't even seen my finest merchandise, yet. What do you say we give sweet cakes, over there, a little demonstration? - You're crazy. - Nobody calls me crazy, except my mother, and she's dead. Self defense. - Hey, Carl, that shit ain't funny. Some shit just ain't funny, man. Respect. - You're right, big brother. He's my portable consciences, and back breaker. - How about a free jolt, honey? - Free jolt? I don't know. - What are you trying to do? She doesn't need anymore. Leave her alone. - [Linda] I do, baby. (slow erie music) (screaming) - [Tony] Yeah. Yeah. - Nice and warm , huh, nice and warm. (screaming) - [Rick] You're crazy, man. - I'm crazy. (gun firing) - [Tony] Christ, Carl! That's fucking loud! Somebody's gonna hear us! - [Freddy] Carl, it's just too fucking loud. We gotta get the fuck out of here. - Anybody here know first aid? - No. - No. - Too bad. (screaming) - [Ricky] I'll buy, man, I'll buy. I'll buy. - Just remember, I was doing you a favor. - [Freddy] See you later Ricky. Tony. (suspeneful music) (upbeat casual music) - Hello, boys. - How you doing, Lieutenant? - Ready to do some work? - Sure. - Ready as I'll ever be, Lt. McAllister. - Things have been getting a little quiet for you, lately, St. Clair? - No, Lieutenant, things are just fine. - Because I've been hearing things about you. Things like, you're a cowboy. - Well, my record speaks for itself. - You record has blood on it! We're looking for results, not mayhem. Capiche? - [Ben] Yeah, capiche. - Alright, well, we have learned that some of our friends on the street have been getting a little ambitious lately. - Well, there's definitely been a lot of increased activity with coke buys. - Al, we just like you and your partner to raise your levels of awareness. That's departmental mumbo jumbo I'm supposed to use. It means, watch your asses. - Wanted to see us? - Yeah Johnny You and Lou are gonna be part of a new four-man unit. When one teams takes a call, the other backs them up, okay? You rotate. - Who's first in rotation. - It's gotta be us, Lou. Seniority. - Age before beauty. (phone ringing) - Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah, okay. We got an OD. You guys better take care of it. Right. (orchestra music) - Ricky, Ricky, Ricky. You really did it, this time, pal. - I didn't do nothing. - I'm gonna call for the meat wagon. - Ricky. Better come clean. You think those guys were bad, Benny, here, he's a real killer. - Bullshit. Benny. - Yeah. - This guy don't think you're bad. Okay. - You better start talking. - I want a lawyer. - You want a lawyer. I'll be your lawyer. Now, are you gonna tell me who your friends are? Got a murder wrap on you. - Just sleeping, man, she's okay. - This look like a beauty nap, huh, pal? Talk! - I don't know anybody's last name. That guy was Carl. We had a thing about price! I say nothing without my lawyer! - Thank you. Wasn't so bad, was it? - [Lieutenant] You guys are terrific. - [Benny] Thanks, Lieutenant. - Terrific assholes, that is. Who told you you could treat a suspect like that? - What the fuck? What are you talking about? - Your buddy, Rick. He says you put a few bruises on him, in addition to the ones Carl gave him. - [Benny] That's bullshit. - Why didn't you just bring him in? Keep the shit to a minimum. He claims St. Clair was with him alone. - I was with him. - You were in the room all the time? - I was. - Right. Very convincing. - Lieutenant, this guy's girlfriend OD's, and he's whining about a few bruises? - Look, you bring him in. We interview him here, where we can record it and tag team it. I'm watching you, St. Clair. - Did Rick give you anything to go on? - Yeah, another deal is going down. Remember our old friend, Lennny? - Yeah. - Well, she's getting into some new action, according to the scumbag. Don't be a cowboy, St. Clair. - Not me. - I want effective cops, not heroes. We might be dealing with a cocaine cartel, here. - No way. These guys are independents, I can feel it. We'll put them out of business. - [Lieutenant] Unless they get to us, first. - Jeez, Lieutenant, what kind of thing is that to say? - Never mind, I feel like shit today. I got a feeling, and I don't like it. I just don't want to lose any cops. Stay close to your partner, Al. - Right. (slow downbeat piano) - Shouldn't we open the curtains, and get some light in here? Sweetie, aren't you going to work? - Yeah, I am. - Mm hmm, no tie? Shave. - I'm undercover today. Come here. How about lunch? - I gotta get to work. - Alright. (suspenseful music) - [Al] Why don't you come in for lunch? - [Ben] I should be pushing on, Linda will be back soon. - You can do it noon or anytime. She's your steady girl, right? So, you miss this opportunity, you'll have another one, like a bus. - What are you saying, Linda's like a bus? - Nah, too sensitive to say something like that. Now, you coming in? - Yeah. - Mm, now this is living. - Stay for some lunch, Benny? - Mom, Dad, I got into a car accident. - Allison. - I just need a ride to he mechanics to go pick it up. - We need to talk. - I guess we'll have to. I have no wheels to escape with. - She wrecked her car. - Ben, I'm sorry about lunch. - Ah, it's okay. Listen, why don't you get some rest. We got a big afternoon ahead of us. - What big afternoon? - It's nothing. - Yeah, it's just routine. - It's like I'm living with two spies. I never know what's going on with you or her. - Honey. - No, we have company now. Why don't you go take a shower, relax a little? The two of you, trying to be Clint Eastwood! Heroic, stoic. All the ic's. Strong, silent, and never share what's going on. - It's the cop diseases, Mag. You don't take your shit home. - Oh, please. I'm sorry. I'm just so frazzled. Alan taking risks on the street, and Allison, hanging out with low lifes. - You want me to go talk to her? - I wish you would. - Okay, I will. Got anything you want to talk about? - You're not gonna play cop with me, are you, Benny? That's my father's job. - I think I know already what the problem is, Alli. - What are you talking about? - Look. A little bit of play is one thing, but if you get heavily into it. Shit, Allison. What's the word? Party? - Yes. (sighing) - You only have to do one thing at a time. And only for yourself. You want to go get your car now? - Yes. - Let's go. (ringing buzzer) - I don't like this sort of buzzer. This ain't our territory. - It's gonna be. (ringing buzzer) - Who's that? - [Carl] It's your mother. - Just a minute. What's up, Carl? - You could be. Can I get you something? - No man, no. - I appreciate the thought though. - Sounds kinda pissed. Thanks. - Weatherman says it's going to snow in the Valley tonight. (laughing) (snorting) (clearing throat) (sniffing) Hey, hey, hey. - What? (snorting) I'm sorry. Want some? - No thanks. - Hey I don't mind? - Ha I guess you don't. (snorting) - How is it? - It's okay. - No it's a purp. - We're not in the market right now. - Lenny you've been in the market since I've know you. - I have to pass Carl. It's a cash flow thing. - Cash flow? Look around this place it's like a fucking library man. If you didn't spend so much money on these books, you'd have some money for some fun. Man you don't want to buy from me that hurts my feelings. - It's just business. - How can I persuade you? - You're just asking too much. Anyway it'd be better to wait for things to cool down. What you did wiping out Rick's girlfriend. - Very cool though. I mean here you are business as usual. - Why should he give 'em? - You must have heard that we got popped. - So? - Shit Carl. - So, Ricky was bad little boy and got hurt. He's not stupid enough to say anything is he? Is he? (groaning) - Okay. The word is yes. Rick got popped and he named you. You're trouble man. - [Carl] You've go that right. - Look nothing personal, but you ought to stay out of sight until things cool down. - I came here to make a deal. So let's make a deal. What do you say? - Sure Carl. Sure. - Let's see what's behind door number one huh. I'll take that. - [Carl] Freddy, Freddy. Give the lady her merchandise. - Okay. This is for you.
