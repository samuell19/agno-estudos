"December 29, 2022, Ehrengart Level 4" Don't be too nervous! Don't treat me like a newbie! Kirin you repair the weapon? Of course, I fixed it last night. What about you, Asuna? I shouldn't have asked. Yes, this is my cherished sword It's time, let's go! For new joiners, let me introduce myself I am Rinder of the Dragon Rider Brigade I will be the captain of this round of raids Please give us more guidance! "Guild" "Dragon Knight Brigade (DKB)" I'm the Tooth King from the Ayn Grunt Liberation Team. I will be the vice captain of this round Let's work together! "Guild" "Ayn Grunt Liberation Squad (ALS)" About the BOSS attack mode and the role of each team It's all the same as we've explained before The reason we got here All thanks to you best players If you appoint me as your captain We will be able to defeat the BOSS of this layer! You said you were the captain. But that's only because your guild is one step ahead of us Found the BOSS room We've come to an agreement, haven't we? You're not trying to express your displeasure now, are you? No, it's not. Listen up! Let's attack the fifth floor! "Horse Head Fish Tail Monster" It's bloodied! We continue to work hard! The life value has changed! Team D, get ready for a tough fight! Team A, prepare to advance! What did you say? We can still fight! The captain is still me! Let's keep rotating! Hearing you say that Obviously because you want to take it yourself Let's strike one last blow! What are you talking about? It's coming! Asuna! Kiryu! Argo! Here it comes! Asuna, let's put it out! Yes! Great! Can you get up, King Tooth? You get your players up first! "Sword and Sworcery theatrical version of the attack chapter" "A witty tune for a gloomy twilight" "December 29, 2022." "Ayn Grunt Level 5: Kalluin" To celebrate we made it to the fifth level Let's toast! Cheers! Cheers Have another one! Argo, thank you for helping us fight the boss That the room will be flooded thing Already written in our guide I naturally need to provide some after-sales service Actually, I thought you wouldn't help us Of course I will help, but I will give you a separate bill. Please don't make it too difficult for me But you can get through four levels in a week That was surprisingly fast. It took us a month to get through the first level At this rate, you can pass the sixth level in a year I don't think so, there are two days left before the New Year That's definitely not possible. Jasna? No matter what I think, it's all happening at the same time What is it? Last hit bonus! At the last moment, our sword skills It hit the monster at the same time, right? Yes So why are you the one who gets the reward? Then... Maybe I hit the monster earlier than you did? No, we hit it at the same time! -But according to the system, I'm faster. - Wait a long time. Here comes the drink Argo, explain to her for me. Even the dog will not grab the food it does not like to eat -What? -A dog? More importantly, Asuna, give me the roast chicken. Good But we are really fast -What soon? -Our attack! From the second to the fourth floor Our attack speed has been increasing Since the tooth king of ALS And DKB's Rinde is a rival They are always competing with each other Although this alliance looks strong at the moment It also has many problems Yesterday's combat was also There is some miscommunication When they meet, they fight. The current strike team used to be the raid team of Tia Bello, right? After Tia Bello sacrificed in the first layer against the boss Rinder then pulled them Forming DKB together, right? But the Tooth King opposed Rinde's leadership model And the formation of ALS Both guilds consider them to be the main attacking team DKB concentrates the best players on the attack And ALS sees the need to diversify resources They all want to be the successor of Tia Bello But their opinions are diametrically opposed Even so, this year's countdown party It's a joint effort between the two guilds, right? In that case, they should be able to get along well I guess they don't want to carry bad relationships into next year, either? What are you talking about? Kiryu, you're not... Didn't you get an invitation? What kind of invitation? You just said There are two days left before New Year's Eve What is the date in two days? It's December 31, isn't it? What's going on? New Year's Eve The two guilds will be holding a countdown party together I have never heard of it at all By the way, Asuna, where did you hear that? DKB's Silvada I also get a lot of instant messages from other people You don't have to be angry about that, do you? I'm not sulking! The party has nothing to do with solo players anyway! So you plan to work alone ah What's going on? Nothing I think it's time for me to go. So fast? Dessert... I need to collect Information about the town's missions and sales items Goodbye, Asuna, Kiryu! By the way About the things you asked for Looks like it will take a while I will contact you if there is any news Yes, thank you! Your dessert, blueberry tart Is two servings enough for you? Yes, thank you Looks delicious! This tower has a gaining effect, and is also a special menu here The gain is the secondary effect, right? This looks like a regular blueberry tart What effect does it have? You'll know when you've eaten Very tasty What is this icon? Try viewing the floor There is something there... What is it? Did someone drop it? No, it's a relic. The fifth level is also known as the relic area There are many relics like this one A day or two later When the bottom player rises up There will be a city-wide relic hunting festival I found more! You don't want to be obsessed with finding relics The location of the item is usually shown on the map Or highlight on the screen But in SAO, items fall everywhere Really, but I can see the highlighted items Is this gain? Yes, dropped kor or gems It will be specially highlighted... Gems? Yes How long will this gain last? I am also looking for relics I see. You're right about not indulging in searching Of course, in the closed beta There are also players who end up becoming experts in relics They are also respected as scavengers I'm wondering if this is their official title? We are allowed to pick up all the relics, right? That's very thoughtful of you. What? I'm not... Don't worry about such things We pick up only the ones that drop all over the city A small part of the relics And the treasure hunt for relics in this town It's like an extra treasure hunt What does that mean? It's a giant maze underneath. They expanded the dungeon And that's where the real treasure hunt is To be honest, there are not many relics found in the city What? You should have stated that earlier! "Anti-Crime Directive" Even inside the circle, I can feel the power of your attack Until the end of the gain effect Let's continue the treasure hunt That's the staircase that leads to the maze I just mentioned Are there more relics underneath? Yes, not only Kerr There are also necklaces and rings with magic effects Rings? A necklace? Yes, ghosts appear frequently But the second level of the basement is like a relic buffet Relic Buffet? What is this ghost you speak of? It's a monster Similar to worms and Orcs Ghosts are monsters without bodies Just like the soul What are those words? It's Russian for "no." Why did you say "no"? I mean... No spoilers! And yes, knowing a new place in advance Will make the game half as fun Then Asuna, lead the way to the underground labyrinth Of course, I'll lead the way. Are you ready? I am always ready to Then let's go. The road is blocked by falling rocks Asuna So beautiful Don't get too excited and fall down! I will not fall down There may be traps along the wall So be careful. And this is outside the circle So the monster will appear Okay, I get it. Beware of the bleak dead will suddenly appear oh It's a ghost like in Scottish folklore, right? Your knowledge is quite extensive Yes, it is the ghost-like monster I mentioned before A ghost? Light... Thanks, Kiryu... Asuna, look out! No... Please stop... Asuna! "Poignant Necromancy" No! Asuna! "Cunning Mouse Man" "Cunning Mouse Man" "Cunning Mouse Man" No way! Wait! I won't let you get away with it! Just one step away It hurts. Send a message "Mail" "Error" "Recipient may be in" "Out of range or not online" Yes Kirin I will show what I can do! "Asuna" "items, equipment, skills" "Ripple Earrings" "Boots of Tenderness" "Fine Steel Sword" Sorry, I've been keeping you in my bag Please help me I should be able to draw it out with this Here it comes! "Cunning Mouse Man" "Achievements" Nothing No No... And no "Item" Scrap paper ball? What is it? 29th 10pm, Basement Level 3 The numbers in parentheses are... Coordinates? Was the meeting held in a dungeon? "Map (in situ)" Very close Did they throw it away by writing it wrong? And this is the route with the monster? If there really is a conference And I became an eavesdropper Hey! You're early today. Long wait! I didn't have to wait long. But it's so hard to come here Another annoying thing is handwritten meeting invitations I rarely write with a pen We should only send messages No, you can. Sending information will leave a record of Okay, let's get right to the point How's that going? It went very well. ALS mainstay will miss countdown party We'll take the maze in one fell swoop Absent from the event, take the maze? This sounds great. They... If the Tooth King and Rinder do not fight It's just boring. Don't make it sound so simple To induce them to have a guild meeting It's not that easy. Of course I know. That's why we took from our leaders Learned some cool conversation skills, didn't you? After stirring up trouble I would love to see them kill each other Killing each other? But our leaders' thoughts are really hard to guess I wonder why we have to go in such a roundabout way We are still just sowing the seeds If we are too reckless, our fun party will end in a flash I know You're enjoying the process, aren't you? Did you hear anything? There are If people hear our little secret It's not good. Come on, show up! What's that? Don't run around! Block the exit there, okay? Really That was also the sound of the monster's footsteps, right? What an annoying predator. Will this monster also appear in the closed beta? But occasionally, items dropped by other players will be brushed That's a great bonus. Speak of the devil, and Cao Cao arrives No way! Isn't this a super rare fine sword? So heavy! Properties... Really? Such a high attack value! Almost comparable to two-handed weapons! Is it? What is your reaction to this? If you're not interested, leave it to me! Don't you use a knife? Can you swing it? With this sword, I can become a top swordsman The name of this sword is Kish Fine Sword! So cool! Please look carefully That's a knight's sword. Since when have you been standing there? I just arrived I was drawn to your voice Oh my God, I thought the people in the hallway Will not hear us at this volume But after getting this dropped rare weapon Overexcited for a moment The rare weapons you mentioned It's the knight's sword, isn't it? Did I say something wrong? I didn't expect you to remember it after hearing it once So what if it is? The thin sword is my partner's equipment Just because It's your friend's weapon, so we have to return it? No, I don't mean to blame you, but... You shouldn't have to get that sword to How about PK my partner, Molt? It's amazing how things have come to this point You implied that I used again at the bottom You've done your tricks, haven't you, Kiryu? Where did you get this from? I didn't expect to be surprised by your screams? How long have you been there? Are you going to keep quiet? Scare me from behind, which shortened my life span by three seconds You should at least answer my question You know how easily I get irritated And we don't have time for small talk They probably heard everything, so we have to kill them. Rash actions can put you at a disadvantage And you saw the properties of that sword, right? Don't underestimate me. There is no way I could lose to an amateur player! And my ultra-rare fine sword... How can I give way to these villains? What an abomination! Surprisingly, they use sound to attract monsters to attack us You scumbags! That's funny coming from you. Anyway, let's get out of here. That's all there is to it. You did a great job. I'm glad you're okay. I'm scared, I'm really scared The ghost appeared, and I fell into the trap I got lost, and lost my fine sword. I thought I was done. I thought it would all end up in this hole in the ground I'm really scared. Well, you'll be fine. If you get lost again I will definitely come to you and save you Because you're my partner, Asuna. "December 30, 2022." "Ayn Grunt Level 5: Shiyaya Village" Thank you, Asuna Invite me to such a great bathhouse! You're welcome I've always wanted to thank you, Argo. It's okay, it's really no big deal That said, the I heard you were in danger yesterday. Yes I'm glad you're okay, Asuna. I will investigate them I'll let you know if I find anything. Argo? What's going on? Don't you think it's too dangerous to investigate them alone? Your information is not only valuable to us For the entire clearance team And intermediate players All very helpful If something happens to you The entire clearance process will be affected So... I was simply worried about you As a friend I think you are pushing yourself too hard Thank you, Asuna. I'm glad you're worried about me. But at the risk of life and limb It's my mission to continue gathering information. Is this coming from the position of an intelligence peddler? No, it is the former closed beta player But that does not mean you have to carry all the responsibility alone Just like Kiryu, he is also with the clearance team The raid team together on the boss battlefield You are because I am in a non-combat guild That's why you're so worried about me, right? Sort of. You're the kind of person who sees what you see, right? Asuna, do you want to try it? What to try? Of course it's a showdown! It's a bit forced to say duel, let's say it's a sparring match A sparring session? Fake showdown Now? Of course! At least put on a swimsuit I don't have a swimsuit Then I will forge one for you now! What are the rules? How about whoever can hit it wins? It's a hit, right? Yes Good Okay, attack when you're ready. I'm coming She's so fast! As I expected, Asuna! I thought I could hit it with one blow But that's just a brush with Let's continue then. Here's my chance! What fun! We passed each other once Can be considered a tie! Of course you can You were just walking on water Is that a skill? No This is the kind of information I would normally charge for But forget it. That is not a skill but the result of my training Didn't you try it in the pool when you were a kid? If you can sink your right foot before Step out with your left foot The theory that you can walk on water I think I have tried... I think it can be done in this world After that, I practiced every day by the river or in the bathhouse. Now I can walk four steps on the water That's an out-of-system skill I think it's also thanks to the speed you just demonstrated Allows you to do reconnaissance work alone You're planning to show me in a duel, right? You'll make me super conceited if you say that But it does. It will help me escape in time Naturally I still need to watch what's under my feet To thank you for bringing me to such a fancy bathhouse I'll send you another piece of information Good You just said I don't have to do dangerous reconnaissance work alone Just like the former closed beta player Kiryu You're also fighting with the clearance team, aren't you? But I don't think Kiri because he doesn't want to take risks Only then did they participate in team play So what else is the reason? It's obvious. That's because he has you, Asuna. Kirin, I'm ready for a bath What about Argo? She decided to go back Let me say hello to you This way You seem to have taken a long time What did you talk about? Women's topics are not supposed to be brought up for discussion! Wait, you mean you and Argo. Talked about the so-called woman topic? Don't ask if you know! By the way, what kind of tone is that? I'm sorry, I'm just surprised We didn't talk about women. Why? Everyone worked hard to get here Finally I can see this beautiful view But they also want to get between the two groups It is also the two major guilds that started the trouble between Even if that would hinder the passage of SAO Also, that Molt And ALS and DKB have to kill each other What would that make of the world? PK Group has bad people like that PK? Player Killer They are the murderers of this world. Asuna, you must always remember this In the floating city of Ayn Ghent There will always be a group of people who ignore the game system Immerse yourself in the atmosphere PK Group How can... Why would they do that? Players who were killed in this world Will also die in the real world Yes, that's why they want to PK here They want to kill the others. I'll tell you more next time We must focus on stopping ALS from raiding the boss level alone How's that thing I asked you about earlier? There should be no problem But why do you To find the two guild leaders of the countdown party? If we only ask ALS They may play innocent. But I don't think that committee would know about that plan You're right. That's why I had to find a chance to meet with them That's the party everyone is looking forward to Don't do anything rash, all right? Party? I think it's okay to have expectations for the party Now that we are all familiar with the strategy They can certainly keep their spirits up That was when we were on the first level The unimaginable Once there is a disagreement, PK Group and this game will take advantage of the situation "Countdown Party 2023" -And this? -There. "Temporarily closed for a private party" Sorry to call you out of the blue, Silvada I don't mind And... "Equipment: Helmet" I am a member of the ALS committee, Leighting. Thanks for coming! No problem! And... Why is my chief here too? Yeah, why are you here? That's what I wanted to ask He asked me to come. I wasn't sure if you would come. So what do you want to say? I'm very busy, you know If you have something to say, just say it! Frankly speaking You ALS plan to miss tomorrow's countdown event Pass the boss layer alone Am I right? Are you serious? Where did you get this false information? I cannot reveal my sources But I can guarantee that this is not a leak from the inside Nor is it information obtained from intelligence traffickers What a bummer! Nonsense, I have to go. Captain! About the program I also just heard from the captain this morning What are you talking about? He said it was a high-level meeting A sudden decision But I don't want to leave behind We work together as a prepared team! And this is the first time that ALS and DKB collaborate on an event Leeting Silvada, I'm sorry I kept this from you. Please tell us Why did you decide to miss the party for that plan? Since I always do things my way I am not qualified to blame you But I think you've gone too far with your plan this time The conflict between ALS and DKB will never be resolved We really don't want two major guilds Continue to hate each other Well, I'll tell you what One of our team members heard very valuable information Intelligence? They said the fifth layer boss will drop rare items Closed beta players like you are aware of this, right? The fifth layer of the boss? I think it's a gun-like weapon No, wait. So that's it! You're right, that weapon is strong. What is it then? It's the guild flag Guild banner ah What is it capable of? In terms of weapons, its attack value is no better than that of a lance But once the equipment player sticks it in the ground Surrounding guild members Then you will get the gain of improving all status What? Can that equipment player still move around? What about the gain time limit? Are there any restrictions on guild members? Cannot move during gain As long as the flag is on the ground, the gain will continue No restrictions on guild members Is this true? This will affect the morale of the players If ALS gets that flag Their morale will be boosted DKB's will then slip In this way, DKB will... Possible loss of leadership They will fall apart. Is this what you want to do to defeat the boss alone? Make sure ALS gets that flag? Can you tell us the reason why co-management is not possible? There must be The reason you can't let DKB get the guild flag, right? You should talk to Rinde and share fairly. A similar comment was made by a member That can't be co-managed That banner can only be tied to one guild You can't unbind after binding It can only belong to one of the ALS or DKB guilds How can... After hearing about it We won't keep quiet either What are you going to do? I will naturally report to Rinde Then stop your plan That would provoke a war between the two guilds Even then... Wait, Silvada! Leeting Mission Director Those who stick to this plan It's all a small group of disturbed members of the team, right? To stop the guild from falling apart You have to approve this plan I'm sure you don't want to go through with this plan Did I say something wrong? Is there really no other way? Leeting Let's fight the BOSS ourselves If it's a flag we got We'll be able to stop the dispute between the two guilds This sounds like the only way Silvada, I... I understand, Lydia, and thank you for your honesty. I will also join Me too! Are you sure? Joining us would mean betraying your guild We need two guilds to pass together I can't let their relationship get any worse. Even if I need to betray the guild I can't betray waiting at the bottom to be released either Ten million players Thank you Have you finished? I'll leave if I'm done talking I'm very busy Tomorrow I will talk to selected members Attack the boss together at 6 p.m. If we are late It's not good if someone is the first to take advantage of it Since you are not selected members Please feel free to My team will leave tomorrow at 6 p.m., got it? Don't get in our way Group leader... Thank you, Tooth King He didn't pay for the meal. The Tooth King and his team will leave at 6 p.m. We should be able to make it in time if we hurry up and prepare. But just the four of us It will be very difficult to defeat the boss We need support Support... I don't think I can call on my guild members Me too Those willing to join may have Four members of Ekir's team and Argo Even so, only nine people I'm not sure but we have no choice. "Title: About a murderer" - wait! I happen to know one more person who can join "Bighorn Billie Sheep" Long time no see Asuna How did you get here? The intelligence peddler told me you were here. She said you were collecting materials in the forest. Looks like you have a very capable intelligence peddler. We played the first layer of the boss after not seeing each other again After that... You were never on the front lines. Is that because you're collecting materials? I collect materials It's because I want to open a store to sell the items I make I am in the process of preparing A store? I want to open a weapons store The bottom layer rarely drops rare equipment But I can enhance with materials This way So if you also sell Fashionable clothes and accessories, I will be very happy I will become your loyal customer! Asuna As a member of the clearance team I guess you didn't just come to see me, did you? Yes, I actually have a request Tomorrow I will be with some friends Intended to challenge the fifth layer of BOSS For some reason We need to get ahead of the two-pass guild Defeat the boss And because of that, we need the help of strong and powerful players For a complete rundown Please help us! This is important Yes, it affects the clearance team This game of death and the future of SAO Asuna, I won't go. Why? I need to prioritize myself over the partner I'm sworn to protect. I am that kind of player I might abandon my friends again and run away Miette Sorry I don't want to betray anyone anymore Asuna, I'm glad to see you again. But I can't help you. See you soon Mitt, fight me! I'm no longer an amateur player who needs your protection So... If I win this matchup You'll fight the boss with me! "Showdown Application" "Are you going to accept the duel application?" "Opponent: Asuna" "One-on-one mode" You'll go back after the showdown, right? "Full win-loss mode, first hit win-loss mode, half-minus win-loss mode" "First strike win-lose mode" "Duel" "Asuna vs. Miette" What's up, Milt? Aren't you going to attack me? Asuna, you're too focused on defense. You need more offense Rabbit Saw, isn't this a game available in the game center? Yes, they have also released a handheld version I've always regretted it. I want to see Asuna here too. If I hadn't said that in the first place Asuna would not be trapped in this cruel world Even so, I... "Winner: Mitt" Can I play with you? You are really strong Asuna you have also become stronger I really tried my best. So I also responded seriously Since I lost, I don't think you will join us But Mitt... See you then! Asuna This gives you Compensate you for this damaged necklace Did you forge this? My forging skills are still very low So the design is simple No, it's really beautiful. It protects against paralysis and injury That's it! I won't be fighting on the front lines anymore Thank you for today. I'm glad to see you. Who is where? Sorry, I wasn't going to hide. Asuna has not returned, so I came out to look for her I came here at the beginning of the showdown So I had to hide Are you... I forgot to introduce myself I am Kiryu, Asuna's partner I know, you're all famous. Are you hiding because you're worried about her? Aren't you being too protective of her? I can't argue with that. Are you going to invite me to join your program? No What should I say... I think you should also notice If Asuna continues to grow She will become stronger Beyond those who pass the team So what? In the end, she will join a guild Then lead the attack of this game of death But until then She needs the support of the people around her For example, you and me The thin sword she is using now Looks like the wind flower sword you used As a rule, the properties of wind flowers Can't take you through more than three levels But Asuna refused to discard When I suggested that she upgrade her wind flower sword with metal After forging a new weapon Now the fine sword is born You don't have to waste your breath telling me this This shows how much she treasures that sword To Asuna, you're a friend who can't be replaced. -Bye. - I... Hate you "December 31, 2022." "Entrance to the fifth level of the labyrinth area of Ayn Grunt." "Lieting, Silvada." "Wolfgang, Robaca, Naija." "Ekir, Argo." What's going on? Nothing It's a boss battle with only nine of us We have a chance to win But I don't want anyone to get hurt. To stop the pass team dispute and facilitated the countdown party for Silvada and Lieting Let's do our best! Okay, let's do it! "Ayn Grunt Level 5: Labyrinth Area" "BOSS room entrance" From here, I wondered if there would be another passage Or maybe it will go directly to the boss's room Is this different from the closed beta? Yes, there was a door before After the opening can lead to the boss room What did the boss look like at that time? It is an ancient relic of a stone giant Even if the guard layer BOSS is similar to the closed test They must have made changes to it By the way, do you know anything about the bosses on this level? You must have forgotten that I used to be an intelligence peddler? Sorry "Currency" I would love to say thank you for your patronage But I will provide free information this time Overall The BOSS looks the same as the closed test, are stone giants But it has a coat of arms on its forehead And that is also its weakness Looks like magic It is the milestone BOSS of the fifth floor So it's powerful We can only see what we can do Yes Then we assume that is the boss room I'll go check first I'll check, leave it to me This staircase will rise from the ground and blocking the entrance, trapping us in it If that's the case, I can get out before the exit is completely closed. I'll go with you. I will not back down Then there's nothing I can do about it. Please look after our rear Kirin Be careful. It's okay, we'll be back soon. This is the boss room, right? No stairs to the sixth floor either There is no sign of the generation of BOSS -Hey! -We might need to move around. To attract it to appear Argo! Argo! Don't come over! -I'm scared to death! -That's what I'm supposed to say! Let's get out of here. Kiryu, look below! Under your feet! What, are there two of them? It's normal to have two arms! Hey, Kiryu! Since there are two arms there will be two legs! Here it comes! Don't move! Look at the ground Our feet almost stepped on the blue line? So if we step on the line The target circle will then appear It will start the giant hand and foot attack I think so. If we can move around without stepping on the line... Are you guys okay? Hasn't the BOSS appeared yet? Get out of the way! Asuna "Void Colossus Fuschus" BOSS and name is different from the closed beta The hands and feet just now It's the BOSS attack technique Once you step on the blue line on the ground The target circle will appear! I will step on the line on purpose! Prepare to attack with a sword technique! Yes! Got it! Here it comes! The crest on its forehead is its weak point! Aim at every opportunity! Go! Three blood! Watch the walls, everyone! It's a model we haven't seen before Can we still continue to attack the boss? I have a bad feeling Everyone back to the stairs! Received! Come over here, everyone! Kiryu! Is that head missing? Silva da! That staircase... It becomes its mouth! Ekir! Start attacking the crest on its forehead! I can't do it, the coat of arms is gone! Wait! I see, this room itself is the boss! The coat of arms must have moved to a corner of the room We need to find it To save Asuna! Damn! Where did the coat of arms go? No matter how many components of the stone giant are in this room This... It's not good, so Asuna will... Damn! Asuna! What's that? Was there anyone else there? Mitt? Hurry up! While we still have the chance! Everyone step on the line Let the hands and feet appear! That way the coat of arms will appear on them! -Copy that! -Try it! Got it! Miette I still can't forgive myself But I won't let you die, Asuna! No, I can't find the coat of arms! Let's try again! I found it! It's running away! Hope I can hit Keep your head down, Kiryu! Take it! Asuna! You're not hurt, are you? I'm fine That's great. You can still fight, right? Of course! It's time to beat the boss How is it different from the closed beta? At the time of sealing, its weak point was fixed on the forehead But now it keeps changing and move to all parts of the body There! Impossible! It's too far! Lockdown attack? We might be able to do it Everyone, stand on the line when you receive instructions I will attack as soon as I find the crest! Then it's all yours! Here! What is it? Get back! It's so big! But we can go on the offensive as originally planned Work together to consume its last blood! Now! Straight up! Switch! Kiryu, the crest doesn't look like it's going to move anymore! Received! Asuna! The coat of arms on its forehead! Received! Miette! Asuna, Kiryu! Take a painful final shot! Received! I will give it my all this time! Use this trick -Finish the job! -Finish it! "Congratulations!" We did it "Congratulations!" -Great! -Great! -We really did it! Wait! Thank you, Kiryu You too Please tell us who got the guild flag Did you hear that? Kirin Not in my bag You're talking about this flag, right? This is it! Can I have it? Of course, I don't need this flag. Miette Asuna Thank you for coming. We should work together again This sounds great. But I also want to find it Ways to live in the world Miette That's one of the real charms of this world, isn't it? Yes, if that's you. You'll find it. I will try and do my best Come see me next time I will definitely come for you Then I'm counting on you. See you soon Bye, Milt. "Equipment, Weapon: Flag of Valor" It's time for ALS to emerge Are you sure you don't want to go to the sixth level with the others? Anyway, there is no hurry in this moment I will go with you. Thank you You really defeated the boss I agree with your strength Black lacquer, BOSS drop items you how to deal with? Yeah, it should drop the guild flag That's true. This is the flag. It is called the flag of martial valor I guess you all know how much it gains Sure enough, the Earth's cheat sealer You can even get this You're not even in any guild, so what are you going to do with the flag? It's not that I don't want to entrust it to you But I have two conditions Conditions? What does it tell us about the conditions? I say two conditions But you only need to meet one If the same drop item is available again One side belongs to ALS and the other side has to be DKB's When the time comes, you need to put the flag Free to other guilds And the other condition? ALS and DKB merged into a new guild I will send this flag immediately There's no way we would do that! Merging with those elites is no joke! You show them the merger too! They must think you're crazy. -And the flag doesn't drop often! -No need to wait that long! Kirin Sorry, I didn't mean to change my conditions Damn! I got it! He never wanted to give it to us in the first place He made the impossible offer This way he can keep the banner to create his own guild -No! -Is that true? -We... -Why are you hogging the item? -I agree! -We don't need to listen to them! Tooth King, there are only two of them There are many ways we can take possession of the flag for ourselves! Are you going to use force, Joe? Then of course! There are more of us than them. You idiot! No matter how important that item is If we use a strong one like Joe said This is no different from criminals Just think of the reasons why ALS exists I'm sorry you heard us arguing. The conditions you just made I assume you made the same offer to DKB? Then of course! Then you keep that flag first There is no way we will merge I'm out of here. The door to the sixth floor is open If you're going back to Kalluin, it's faster that way. Is it? Thanks a lot, Kiryu In the end, the black paint steals all the points He doesn't have a guild but still hogs the rare item -It's not fair. - We're working hard too. He keeps all the good ones for himself He should walk alone Thank you, Asuna. After a short break, we... Jasna? Why... Why... Why can't they understand you, Kiryu For the pass team For all those who are trapped in this world We all risked our lives in the fight You're just trying to keep them from getting into a fight. But they... They only stay with people of their own kind Do what they like Make trouble for others when you have nothing to do For those people, Kiryu you... You fight until you are exhausted But they still see you as the bad guy! They were all wrong... Must be wrong Asuna, this is the path I chose I decided not to join any group by myself I am not looking for recognition or other people's appreciation and struggle As long as I can protect myself and the people around me I don't care about the rest All this just to make sure I can survive in this world So I am not qualified Recognized Or be appreciated You don't have to feel sad and cry for me It's my decision who I want to shed tears for Then let me give you the appreciation If there is something I can do for you Just tell me. This is enough So is there anything I can do for you? You sit down! Thank you -Five! -Five... -Four! -Four... -Three! -three... -Two! -Two... -One! -One... -Zero! -Zero... Happy New Year! Kirin, Happy New Year! Happy New Year! I didn't expect fireworks I was wondering where to buy I heard that I can be in the starting town Hidden in some corner of the weapons store to buy They said Li Tian found the store. Then we use the fireworks on the monster... Unfortunately we can not burn fireworks in the circle Is it? It's already 2023. I never thought two months would pass like this Yes, when I was stuck in the inn in the town of the beginning Feels like a long day Now every day is a flash I'm leaving the town of beginnings Before I met you I thought all my weapons were disposable I bought a lot of the same weapons Because it has not been enhanced or maintained So when the fine sword becomes blunt I would have left it in the dungeon But that was the old me who was conceited Then I got the Windflower Sword from Miette Thanks to your help, I have forged my current weapon I just felt my way around Gradually, I began to feel I should take care of myself more often So you should take care of yourself too, Kiryu Of course I'm going downstairs to get some drinks and food. I'm coming with you! Watch your step What's going on? Nothing What's the problem? No Let's get out of here. It's show time Who are you? Don't move If you dare to move around I then stabbed the knife into her Here are the circles Your intimidation will not work Wake up, Mr. Black Paint The circle is up to the courtyard This is the dungeon so it can work You only have a knife, and can not do anything You are really bold If I use a level 5 paralysis and poison Would it be better? Why are you doing this? Because it's fun, of course, brother -Is it interesting? -Yes. I like to have fun This is a big stage after all I had to prepare something, to create excitement It's not fun if we are disturbed Let's change the place How about the basement? Got it. Jasna? Kiryu! Yes! We'll see you next time, Mr. Black Paint, Miss Swordsman! This knife is not poisoned He is really lying Why are you so reckless? If this is really outside the circle There's no way he'll let us move to the basement. He will stab me directly What do you do if you guess wrong? Nothing Because I have this "Equipment, Amulet: Annolite Pendant" No, right? Are you serious, Asuna? Thank you, Mitt In any case, we're all right. -For safety's sake, let's go out... -Kiryu, the man just now Could it be that they attacked us because they wanted to get the guild flag? He did mention the "big stage" Then he said, "Prepare something, create excitement." Could that refer to the conflict between the two guilds? Even that's too fast. They are just learning of our existence. He made the impossible offer This way he can keep the banner to create his own guild One of our team members heard -Valuable information. - Other than that, that Molt. And ALS and DKB have to kill each other Could that be the PK group? Molt and his companion... Most likely I believe information about us is being spread around. The world will end up as Where players kill each other And no longer a cheat game You're right, in that case We need to protect that flag even more If it really becomes like this I know some PK techniques During that closed beta period I have played against them. Then I'll join you. What? I didn't mean for you to join No, I've decided! From now on, I will not leave you alone in danger! And we're partners, aren't we? It's like you saved me in the basement. I also want to support you You're right, we're partners. Let's start working together now Yes! Let's go, Kiryu Good, Asuna
