Just means you're lazy. Look, I'm trying my best. Well, your best ain't good enough, Danny! Don't worry, I'm not going to be some kind of bum all my life. You got that right, because if you don't get a job soon, I'm kicking you out of this house. Alfonso, get up, we're going to be late for church!

Sí, church. Lord knows you need it. -What's that? -What's what? Ah! Ah! Ah! Hm? This. What? This! Oh, Ma, that's just, you know, a hickey. Hey, you're messing up my hair, Ma! Alfonso...

We don't need no food stamps. We ain't that poor. Come on, man. I'll give you a good deal. Twenty bucks worth of stamps for ten bucks! -No, that's cool, dawg. -No, man. Okay, okay, okay. Twenty for five bucks. Now that's a bargain not even the Welfare Department could give you. Get your crazy ass out of here, dawg. All right, then. See how you are? I'll catch you guys later, eh? You're short 30. Oh, yeah. You know, I got this crazy smoker, man. But he say he's gonna get me next week, so... You're already fucking up with my, Ray. Don't think I'm stupid too.

I was at the library, studying. Damn, girl, you're always studying. You know, one of these days your head's going to explode -from all that studying. -No. There's nothing wrong with working too hard. You should try it. You might like it. -Yeah, right. -Hm. "Yeah, right." Yeah. You know that Alfonso's parents are having their anniversary party this Saturday? -It's this Saturday? -Mm-hm. You want to come? Yeah, I want to come. -Yeah? -As long as you gonna be there. I'm gonna be there. You gonna look good for me? Danny, wait. What? Danny, it's a letter from New York University. Yeah? -Open it! -No, I'm too nervous. I don't know. You open it. -Hurry, hurry. -All right, relax, girl! You look like you're going to pee on yourself or something. -Want me to get you a diaper? -Let's go, hurry. Okay, all right. It says, "Congratulations... "we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted to New York University." Oh, my God. I can't believe it. I'm in. -I'm in, Danny. -Wait, wait, wait. New York University. Isn't that, like, in New York? I can't believe I'm going to New York. I thought you said you were going to stay around here when you finish junior college. Danny, aren't you happy for me? No, I'm not fucking happy for you. Oh, please. No, what... You're, like, leaving? And I'm supposed to be happy about that shit? You know, you don't care who you leave behind, do you? That's not true. You know, that's all right. I'm getting used to people walking out of my life. Danny. Danny, come back. Man, gotta say, that's good, dawg. Did you check out my mom and dad, bro? You wonder why I'm so horny all the time? Look at them. It's called love. Something you know nothing about, Mr. Wham-Bam-Thank-You-Ma'am. Shit, that's right. That's me, qualified pimp, bro. I was hoping Lucy'd bring some of her fine-ass friends, because I'm horny like a motherfucker, dawg. You'd better get you a kung fu grip, G.I. Joe, because Lucy's ass ain't coming. Shit. Man, I ain't had food this good in a while. Man, you got enough food on that plate? Yeah, dawg, I'm good. I'm out, though. Where are you going, bro? The party's just starting. I'm gonna go kick it with Gramps. Oh, shit, man. Kick it here with us, dawg. Fuck Gramps, all right? I got to go, dawg. Sorry, man. You know, rent's due. Need the money. Get the fuck out of here then, faggot. There's Lucy right there, bro. I don't know. -She looks good, though. -Hell, yeah, she looks good. Let's get over there, man. How do I look? -Greasy as shit. -Shit, just the way I like it. Come on. Lucy. Glad you ladies made it. Danny. Hey, Alfonso, this is my friend, Chespi. We go to school together. Chespi, huh? That's a beautiful name. Beautiful face. Big...beautiful eyes. You must be a model, right? How original. Nice to meet you. Pleasure's all mine. Lucy, you never told me you had such a beautiful friend. You know, I used to be a model. Are you for real? You'd better watch out for this one, Chespi. I think I can take care of myself, Lucy. Yeah, Lucy, she can take care of herself. Can I offer you something to eat? Like a beer? Yeah. Sure. 'Sup? We'd better talk. Danny, I want-- Fucking come on, man. Hey, fool. Wake the fuck up. Keep an eye out. I got it. You see what I told you? When these fools see me rolling up, it's like I'm the motherfucking ice-cream man. I just don't like this neighborhood, dawg. Making me all nervous and shit. Get the fuck out. -'Sup, Gramps? -What the fuck you want? I wondered if you can hook me up with some shit, dawg. I'll hook you up when you got the money. Oh, come on, dude. Front me this one time, dawg. I'll pay you tomorrow, I swear. I get my General Relief check first thing in the morning. Motherfucker, this look like a motherfucking layaway plan? Come on, dawg, 20 bucks ain't gonna break you. I said, does this look like a motherfucking layaway plan? -Dude, no. -What? Hey! Go that way. You fucked up. What you doing, Gramps? Let's get the fuck out of here. Shut the fuck up, Raymo, and pay attention. This is what happens to fools that fuck with my reputation. Don't do it. Don't kill me, Gramps. Please, come on, we go back way too long. Come on, here. I don't know what I was doing, but here's the money, take the money back. -Stupid motherfucker. You ain't ever gonna fuck with my reputation again, you fucking dope fiend bitch. Let's just get out of here, dawg. Pick up the money. I said, pick up the fucking money. -Sit down. -Ow, Danny! You know you just made a scene. I'm not going to let you leave. You're not going. Danny, I have to. I thought we had something here. Danny, we don't have anything here. What are we gonna do? We gonna get married, and then-- And then you're gonna take care of us by playing basketball for the rest of your life? Hustling for ten bucks a game? Come on, Danny. I want to have more than that. You don't think I want more than that? I want more than that too, Lucy. Then, good. You can come with me. Let's go. Let's get an apartment together. What, leave? I-I just can't leave, Lucy. Danny... look at me. I'm not the same quiet little girl you met in high school anymore. I don't want to have to depend on you, okay? I want to be able to survive on my own. I want to go out there and be prepared. Who the hell taught you that? Your lesbian butch haircut college professor? Fuck, Danny, you didn't hear a thing I just said, did you? You just say "fuck"? I can't believe you just said "fuck." I never heard you say "fuck" before. Danny, I said it, okay? I said it. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. There, I said it again. I swear to God, college is just messing you up bad, girl. I'm leaving, Danny. And I'm leaving with or without you. Nothing. I don't know. I just wish life was easier, you know? I just don't know anything about anything right now, abuelito. What's the difference? Well, how does a pigeon know when he's ready to fly? Boom, boom, boom! Just dumped his whole clip on this poor fool. Damn. I'm telling you, Ray, Gramps is fucking crazy. This is some serious shit, dawg. We're talking straight-out murder here, bro. Ain't like I pulled the trigger, you know what I'm saying? No, but you were there. Look, man, I'm just trying to make some money. I ain't into all this killing shit, you know that. Should have thought about that shit from the get-go. Who's fucking up now, Raymo? Come on, man. Come on, let's play. -No, no-- -Just play. Just play, man. Back on, Danny. Back up, man. Come on, Danny. Take it to the hoop. Let's go. Damn, man. Get off me, man. Hey, we got a problem? Yo, just take the ball, man. -Take it up. -Yo, Ray, take it up. Get a point, Alfonso. Don't mess up. You want this? Get off me, man. Yo, Alonzo, throw it, dawg. Is your girl coming? Fuck! Pass the-- Get the ball out! Alfonso, pass the fucking ball! I ain't passing nothing, man. Come on. Pass the ball, dawg. Yeah! Yeah! -Give me that! -Whoo-hoo! Yeah. You guys will never beat us, man. - Go sit down. - Later, losers. Go sit down. We did it, guys. -Get off the court. -Yeah! I fucking hate them motherfuckers. They think they better than us. Yo, I don't think we're good enough to beat them, dawg. That's our problem. We're always feeling sorry for ourselves. I know we can beat their old asses. I don't feel sorry for myself. I feel sorry for this silly fucker. You lost the game. Me? Yo, I got fouled, dawg. Yo, Danny, you saw that shit, man. I got fouled. Hey, just remember, Alfonso, you can't do it by yourself, all right? -Only as a team. -What? -Just remember that shit. -What? What, Danny? What? -What? -Man, shut the fuck up. You sound like a broken record. "What, Danny? What? What?" -"What? What?" -What'd I do? What'd I do? -What, I like you don't know? You fucked our world, is what you did. Flossing for the bitches. We lost. Shit, he's coming, man. What's up, little homies? -What's up? -What's up, dawg? Hey, Raymo, I heard you're selling a little something-something. Oh, yeah? What you need? I'm glad you asked, homey. Boy, do I got a deal for you guys. I'll trade you a dove sack... for these brand-new bibles that I ripped off. Dawg, I can't believe you stole bibles, man. Come on, Raymo. It's an even trade, eh? Bibles for little mota. This ain't a swap meet, dawg. - No. - Okay, okay, okay. Check this out. They're New Testament, dawg. I don't give a fuck how new they are. Plus, you know I can't read. See how you are? And I thought you were a businessman, eh? God's gonna punish you for this, Raymo. Torneo, you want the shit or not? Yeah, I guess so. How much you want? Give me a dovey. Two dimes, dawg. All right, then. I'm out of here. Laters. Later. You know, Big Joe used to be a really good boxer in prison. They should have kept that lowlife locked up. Ooh, the guy on the right's pretty good. Boy, you don't know shit from Shinola. He's a washed-up boxer. Look at that shot. Hell, no. He keeps dropping his left, Danny. Those jabs take their toll on a boxer. Do you have that habit? Dropping your left? All the time. He's got a lot of heart, though. Most fighters do. Mando Ramos, Bobby Chacon, Muhammad Ali. They never quit. They just keep coming at you. Isn't that the way you were when you fought? I never ran away. Doesn't having heart count for something? Having heart doesn't count for shit. You still come out a loser. I'm going to bed. Turn out the lights. Can I help you? Yeah, you have the little pig-shaped ones? No, we ran out. But we'll have some more later on today. You know, I was wondering about that sign in the window. -What about it? -Do you still need someone? Well, I sure do. Do you have any experience? Experience? Well, in a bakery would be nice. No, but I'm a hard worker. I can do that kind of work. I got strong hands. I'm sorry, kid, I'm looking for somebody -with a little experience. -Look, I'm a fast learner. -I pick things up like this. Look, I need a job, sir. Please. Everybody around here needs a job, muchacho. Look, look, I'm just asking you for a shot. You won't be sorry, I promise. Lookit, I pay $4.75 an hour. Eh? No benefits, because I cannot afford it. The hours are long. 4:00 in the morning to 4:00 in the afternoon. Bottom line: it's ball-busting work. The last guy quit on me. Well, what do you think? Perfect. Can you start Monday? Hell, yeah, I can start Monday. Good. All right, I'll see you Monday. -All right. -Hey, oh, by the way. -What's your name, kid? -Oh, Danny. Danny Pacheco, sir. Okay, Danny Pacheco. I'm Mr. Ochoa. -Nice to meet you, boss. I'll see you Monday. Early. Yeah. Yeah, early. We'd better stop, Alfonso. Stop? What do you mean, stop? I mean, stop. -W-W-What's wrong? -How bad do you want me? Shit, I want you bad. What is it? What, does my breath smell or something? How bad do you want me, Alfonso? I just told you, I want you real bad. Enough to beg for it? Shit, I ain't begging for nothing. Okay, okay, okay. I'm begging you. I'm begging you. I'll let you know when I'm ready. For now, you have to "talk to the hand" thing. The hand thing? Yeah. The hand thing. Now, can you please drive me home? Shit. What'd you say about my mama? Yeah. Oh, yeah! Nice shot, dawg. Shit. Lucky shot. Lucky? Them's some skills, doggy dawg. Let's see what you got. How was your date with Chespi last night? It was all right. I knew you wasn't gonna bone her. You're such a dick, Raymo. Come on, Chespi's a good girl, man. We're talking Catholic high school here. Shit, I think her parents even want her to become a nun. -Shit! What you laughing at, bro? -Bullshit, man. -What you laughing at, bro? Don't you know that Catholic high school girls are the worst? You see, they know the power of pussy, and how to use it. Trust me, man, I'm like "Go see Cal" when it comes to bitches. Shit, who are you bullshitting, bro? When it comes to girls, you're a big old scaredy-cat. Or a faggot. Oh, oh, there you go again. See, you just frustrated. I'm gonna do you favor. I'm gonna call Chespi and tell her to give you that pussy, because I'm tired of this faggot shit. Shit, you don't know jack, bro. Chespi was on me like a backpack. I had her begging for my big, brown snake, bro. But you know what? I'm gonna make her ass wait. Shit, who does she think she is? That's right. Never let a bitch call the shizzat. -Yeah. -That's what I'm talking about. Full control, baby. That's what I'm about. -Right. Oh, snap. Yo, man, I got to jet. Gramps is paging me. Damn, bro, it's like you're picking Gramps over us, man. Yo, I thought you were getting out of this game, man. Look, man, I told you I was gonna get out. Just got to make some snaps, make my ends meet, help Ma out. -You know what I'm saying? -You already said that shit. Look, man, I'll catch you on the flip side, all right? Yo, leave the beer, dawg! That's some good quality shit, homes. I'm buzzing like a motherfucker, man. Right. On a serious tip. Big Joe's out. I think he wants to gang me for my shit. But I'll let you know one thing. What? Ain't nobody gonna fucking gang me for my shit. Fucking nobody. You know, I was thinking, Gramps. After I get a little bankroll, I'm... I'm going to take a little break for a minute. Get a 9-to-5. You know, a real job. -A real job. -Yeah. Let me tell you something, Raymo. You gonna get out when I let you out. -Yeah, but-- -Yeah, but nothing, fool. Why do you think I capped that basehead the other night? To teach your ass a lesson. I go down... you go down to. What, you didn't think I brought you into this because I thought you were smart? No, motherfucker. Rule number one: don't let nobody in that's smarter than you, because they might end up burning you. You ain't getting out. I don't feel so good. Handle it. 'Sup, Big Joe? Let's take a walk, homes. What the fuck you think you're doing, Raymo? Didn't Gramps teach you anything? Taught me how to make that dollar. Yo, let me teach you how to stay alive, homes. Whenever a sign of two heads, always keep them in front of you. Don't even turn you back on nobody, no matter what. Yeah, I guess. You guess? Ain't no guessing about it, homes. Ain't as if you're some fucking Avon lady selling soap dishes. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, homes. In this business, if you turn your back on anybody, you're gonna get fucked. Some motherfucker's gonna creep up on your ass and take you for all you've got, then put you in a box just for the fuck of it. You see this scar right here? Yeah. I turned my back on a motherfucker one time. And just like that, he stuck me with a screwdriver. I almost lost my eye, homes. That ain't gonna happen to me. I'll be there early, Mr. Ochoa. What are you thinking, Danny? Shit. Danny! You getting the hang of it? Yeah, everything's good, Mr. Ochoa. Good. If you need any help, just ask Marcos. Ah! Fuck! Shit! Did you burn yourself? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. After 25 years of working here, I don't even have to wear gloves anymore. Of course... I don't have any feeling left in my fingers. What's up, Joe? What's up, homey? Brought you some sweet bread to go with your beer. Thanks, homes. How was work? It ain't easy, that's for sure. There's a guy there, busting his ass for 25 years. Can't even feel his fingers anymore. Shit, I don't know if I can last that long. Remember when you were younger? I used to tell you there was more out there than you think. Yeah, I remember. The neighborhood can't offer you everything, homes. You know, when I was growing up, I never got good advice. It was always bad. I had this constable one time tell me, "You know, you people are real good at fixing cars, but you got to remember to fix them, not to steal them." He said that? Yeah, he did, homes. But I taught that motherfucker a lesson. What'd you do? I stole his Volvo from the teacher's parking lot, and I set it on fire right there in front of the schoolyard. -Nah! -Yeah, I did. Good times. Lucy got accepted into this fancy college in New York. Is that right, homes? Yeah, and she wants me to go with her. Well, there it is, Danny. You could do something with yourself. Something good. Don't ever be afraid to leave the 'hood, bro. Man, I ain't afraid. You ever been afraid, Joe? I was always afraid, homes. I had a lot of chances to do something with myself when I got out of the joint, but I kept coming back to the neighborhood, you know? That'll always be my biggest mistake. So I guess we're all afraid, huh? Abuelito. I am. I brought you some sweet bread. Guess you won't be kicking me out soon, huh? There's a plate on the stove for you. I'm not hungry. I'm just going to go to bed. In Jesus Christ's name, we pray. - Amen. - Amen. So, Alfonso, tell me more about this girl that you've been seeing. What's her name? Crespi, or Crispy. -Chespi, Dad. -Chespi, honey. Is she a good girl? Yes, Dad, she's a good girl. The only way this boy's going to meet a good girl is at church. Ma... Chespi is a good girl. I'm telling you guys, she is like an angel. I mean, she went to Catholic high school and everything. And she was going to be a nun. A nun? See? Dios mío, thank you. Alfonso, have you slapped flesh with her yet. He didn't mean that. Who's teaching you these things? Alfonso. -I did not. -Ah! Listen, you'd better keep your little quack-quack in your pants with this Crispy girl. Do you hear me, Alfonso? Quack-quack? What? Don't give me this "what-what" business. You know exactly what I'm talking about. "What?" And, by the way, I talked to Frederico about that job for you. Now, he wants to see you on Saturday. Saturday? I can't then. I'm playing ball with the guys. Can you believe this kid? Playing ball with the guys is much more important than getting a job? Look, you'd better be there on Saturday. I mean it. And don't you dare forget. Okay, okay, I'll be there and I won't forget. You'd better not. Can somebody please pass me the beans? I'm ready, Alfonso. Take me. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Shit. How long have you had this in your wallet? I guess it's been a while, man. All right, look. Maybe we should go to the store and buy a three-pack. Who cares, baby? Who cares? Wait. You sure, right? Do you want me or not? Shit, of course I want you. Whatsup, man? Hey, you Raymo? Yeah, I'm Raymo. What you want? Dove sack, homes. Hey, is this shit good? Is this shit good? Hell, yeah, my shit's good. Hurry it up. I got to take a leak. Is my shit good. I don't fuck around, dawg. Yeah, my shit's good. I got the bionic chronic. Shit, yeah, take you to another level, man. Fuck up, homes! This is fucked up. What's up, man? Shut the fuck up, fuck bitch! -Yo, what's your-- -Shut the fuck up, homes! Take his money, homes. Fuck it, ése. Fuck it! Let's work something out, man. Fuck off, Raymo Ray! Take that shit, homes. Let's just talk about this, man. Shut the fuck up! Fucking got it. I got some-- I'll hook you up with some fucking shit. What do we do now, homes? Fucking blow this fucking fool's head off, ése. You got my shit, dawg. Come on, man. Get on the floor, ése! -Right now, homes! -Hands behind your back! Blast his ass. Blow his fucking head off, ése. Put your hands behind your back. Get the fuck out of here, ése. Fuck. Fuck. What the fuck you doing outside? What? What happened to your pants? I got jacked. What? Oh, fuck, dawg. How much? $1,500, man. They fucking caught me slipping in the alley, dawg. Fucking Big Joe told me, man. He told me to fucking watch my back. What the fuck you gonna do? I don't know, Danny. Fuck, dude, Gramps is gonna come looking for your ass, dawg. He's gonna want his cash. I know Gramps is gonna want his money. You think I need to hear that from you? This is your doing, Ray. You walk around like some fucking kingpin. Didn't have to go out like this. So, you going to leave me hanging now? Huh, dawg? Is that just about now? I told you so? No, no, dawg. I ain't gonna do that to you. Come on, you're like my brother. I'm just so fucking tired, Danny. I'm just so fucking tired of everything. Look, dawg, at least you okay, man. You know? I mean, just crash here tonight. Dude, I get paid from the bakery next week. I mean, it ain't gonna cover $1,500, but it's yours, homey. Thanks, dawg. Just...just try to get some sleep, all right? Boy, I fucked up, man. $1,500? He got to borrow $1,500, bro? I can't believe that, man. He almost got his ass taken out. Shit, dawg, I'm broke, man. I mean, maybe I could ask my pops for some cash. Not $1,500, that's for sure. -What are we going to do? -I don't know, what can we do? -We ain't got that kind of cash. -We got to do something. Gramps ain't gonna let this shit go. I know he's not going to let it go. Where's Raymo at now? At his pad. Hiding out. For how long, dawg? Yo, dawg, I know you don't want to hear this shit right now, but I got in Chespi's pants last night, bro. Got bucko, I was like-- -Get off me, man! Shit. You lying, dawg. Shit, I ain't lying, dawg. We went at it all night long. I must have nutted six or seven times, man. That's got to be some kind of world record and shit. I can't believe she gave that shit up to your ass, man. Didn't you say she wanted to be a nun or something? That don't sound like no nun to me. I hit that shit so hard she almost passed out, bro. Yo, I took full control, baby. I showed her who the man was. I was like... Dude, you wear a jimmy hat, though? Come on, Al, tell me you at least wore that little old, expired, crusted shit you got in your wallet. Of course I did, dawg. What you think, I'm stupid? -You didn't wear one, huh? Dawg, that shit is just too good, man. Just got caught up in the moment, you know? I figured I didn't need one, you know? Well, I hope that pussy was worth it. Oh, that shit was worth it, bro. I was like... Oh! Your daddy! What's up, Joe? Don't touch it with that, homes. Sorry, man. I heard Raymo got caught with his pants down last night. Shit. How'd you know that? Come on, homes. I've been here too long not to know. Where's Raymo? We don't know where he is. Yeah, we haven't seen him around, dawg. Don't fuck with me, Danny. He said he didn't know what was happening, ése, so why don't you just step off. No, fool, why don't you step off. You're in my business now, Joe. Why don't you just get the fuck out of here, man. What? You think you're gonna come back to this neighborhood and think everything's gonna be the same? Fuck you, old man. I ain't that little kid anymore, fool. So why don't you just take your little prison fantasies and get the fuck out of here. And you. You just tell Raymo to watch his back. Yeah, he said watch your back, man, with a Glock in our face. Shut up, Danny. Who's that? Relax, relax, relax, man. It's just a car driving down the street. Look at me, man. Look at me, I'm all-- I'm all fucked up now. I can't even fucking think straight. -Who's that? -Come on, Raymo. Look, you're getting me nervous. Shit, dawg, it's just a car. Fuck, I hate this shit, man. Hiding out in my own house like a fucking prisoner. Well, we shouldn't be out here, man. Gramps will smoke the three of us. Will you shut the fuck up, Danny? Hey, fuck you, man. He didn't have the gun in your face. -It was in my face. -I was fucking there, okay? I was right behind you, bro. Not right now. Was it worth it, Ray? Huh? You want to make a little cash? Now you're hiding out here? Fucking up, Raymo. You know, I may be a lot of things, but one thing I ain't gonna be is a punk. Fuck that. You know what, man? I'm gonna have a little respect. I can't run from Gramps my whole life. Fuck him. You're thinking all wrong, dawg. Look, you just wait until things cool off, all right? - Cool off? -They're gonna cool off real quick ok? I fucking know Gramps. That fucker's crazy. Fuck him, though. He's gonna catch me? Don't let him catch me here. And he ain't going to. Not in front of my jefita, man. She doesn't deserve to see me go down like that. Let's handle this shit on the street, like men. Yeah, you thinking all wrong, dawg. So you just keep fucking up. Can I come in? Yeah, I guess. I wanted to come and say goodbye. I don't want to leave with hard feelings between us, Danny. So you were really going to leave me, huh? I have to be back east the day after tomorrow. I hate this shit, you know that? Danny, please. Please stop running away from me, please. When my mom walked out on me and my dad... I swore to myself I would never let myself feel that way again. And now here you are, just... just bringing all those feelings back again. Danny, I'm sorry. Sometimes... Sometimes we're just forced to make decisions in our life that we don't like. And I don't like this. But I have to do it. So, what am I supposed to do? Just let you go? No, I don't want you to let go. I want you to come with me. Oh, God, Lucy, I wish I could. -Then come. -I can't. It's just too many things I got to take care of. There's just too much going on. I just want you to know that this is important to me, okay? I know. I love you so much, Danny. I love you. I don't want to leave you, Danny. I love you. That's bullshit. Raymo got jacked, man. Look, I know that and you know that. But that's a rumor the guy started, and it makes Gramps look weak. Man, fuck Gramps. He's gonna get his money back. What are you, stupid? Ain't about cash no more, homes. It's about Gramps' reputation on the street. And it doesn't help that Raymo's walking around the neighborhood as if he's wrong. You'd better check him, homes. I don't want you talking to that convict. -Yeah, but-- -Yeah, but what? Don't you ever listen to me? He's nothing but a no-good criminal. Why are you so worried about Big Joe? -Who cares if I talk to him? -Just stay away from him. -You hear me? -Why? Because I'm your father, that's why. Why don't you act like my father. At least Big Joe's there for me. He talks to me. Goddamn it, what do you want from me? -I don't want anything from me. -Damn it, Danny! I give what I got to give. You don't give me nothing! You've never given me anything! I thought your job was to teach me what it's like to be a man. But instead, you're just some broken-down old man in a wheelchair that doesn't give a shit about nothing, especially me. What? You want to hit me? Is that what you want? Well, come on, you son of a bitch. You're just like that whore mother of yours. Don't you ever talk that way about my mother, you hear me? You don't deserve her. You remember that time you lost that fight and got your ass knocked down in the second round? What did you do? You beat her... so I couldn't recognize her beautiful face anymore. You remember that, old man? Because I swear to God, I'll never get her face out of my fucking head. You son of a bitch. He's my son, jefe. I raised him as I saw fit. Danny! Come here! You wanted to see me, Mr. Ochoa? Yeah, Danny. Come in. I know you've been with my for a while. And I hate to do this. But I'm going to have to let you go. -W-W-What did I do? -Oh, no, no. You didn't do anything wrong, mi'jo. You're a good worker. One of the best I've had. So then why are you letting me go? Things are slow, Danny. Cut my hours. I-I-I'm sorry, Danny. I can only afford one helper. And you know Marcos has been with me for many years. Then cut my hours and my pay, Mr. Ochoa. Jesus, man, I'm already paying minimum wage. I cannot go any lower. Look, I really need this job. You're a good kid. And this is very difficult for me, Danny. So please try to understand. I just can't keep you. Yo, Ray, I don't think you should be sitting out here out in the open, you know? I told you, man, I don't give a fuck. Shit, Ray, stop screwing around, man. Damn, if it were me, man, I would have gotten the fuck out of Dodge already. Nah. Not me, man. Like I said, whatever happen, happens. Like you just said, shit happens. Hey, man, where's your Jeep at? Chespi's driving. Oh, man, don't tell me you're whipped already. -That pussy must be good. -Yo, shut up. I ain't whipped, all right? Look, man, everybody knows when you start lending your ride out to a female, it's over. -You whipped. Night, Alfonso. -Will you shut the fuck up, man? I ain't whipped, all right? How many times I gotta tell you? I'm the man. I wear the pants. I call the shots. That's right, you wear the pants but you ain't got no car. -Yo, just chill... Get in the Jeep, Alfonso. But me and Raymo were hanging out-- I said, get in the Jeep now. Yo, I got to go, dawg. You gonna be all right? I'm gonna be all right. You sure, man? Yeah. I was gonna step anyway... you pussy-whipped motherfucker. Fuck you, homo. That's right, I'm a homo. A Homo sapien, you brown bitch. Get your ass home. What's up with you? Is it that time of the month or something? As a matter of fact, it's not. I'm late, Alfonso. What do you mean, you're late? I mean, I'm pregnant. Do your parents know? I can't tell my parents. You know how religious they are. No, they're going to think they've wasted all their money sending me to a Catholic high school. You're just going to have to marry me, Alfonso. Marry you? That's what I said. Well, what about your college and stuff? Please. I never wanted to go to college. That was my father's idea. Marriage and a family is what I want. And what I want, you want. Right? I guess. Are you crying? Crying? I just got something in my eyes. I can't believe it. I should be the one that's crying, Alfonso. What are you...? Wait a second, Chespi. Wait, wait, wait. Why should you be crying? For all I know, you were afraid of losing me, so you went ahead and let yourself get me pregnant. So I let myself get you pregnant? Of course you did. This isn't my fault. Don't even try to put the blame on me. Look... maybe we should just think about this. Oh, boy, I knew this was going to happen. -What? -What? What "what"? All you wannabe players are all alike. This is the way it's going to work. You are going to ask my parents permission to marry me. And that's final. Can I ask you something? What? Why me? Because I've never loved someone as much as I love you. And... I never, ever want to let you go. Really? Yeah, really. That used to be us. Remember just fucking around all day? Got nothing to worry about. Just...just chilling, man. Yeah, I wish those kids never have to grow up. At least not in this neighborhood. What's wrong with you, dawg? Chespi's pregnant. Damn! -Are you serious? -For reals? Straight up. I ain't lying. What are you gonna do, dawg? I don't know, man. Are you crying? How stupid, man! I ain't crying. I just got something in my eye, man. Looks like you're crying like a little bitch. I'm gonna make your ass cry in a second, bitch. I don't know, Fonse. I was you? I'd kick that female to the curb, that's what I'd do. I just feel bad that I did this to her, you know? It's all my fault, man. I guess I'm gonna have to do the proper thing and marry her. Fonse, what are you, crazy? Look, man, you ain't got to do nothing you don't want to do. You the man. You in control of the situation, dawg. -Remember that. -I know I am. But she's, like, lost without me, you know? She really is. She wouldn't even know what to do. It's like you always say, man. Handle your females. Handle them. Don't let your females handle you. I do always say that, huh? Right? Yup. I don't need them ho's, big daddy. No. You don't need her. I don't, huh? Hell, no. Shit, it's not like she got my nuts in a glass jar. -She got one of them. -But you got one left. Shit, ain't no way I'm gonna marry her, dawg. She's dreaming, and she can keep on dreaming. Shit, because I don't need her in my life, right? I would just like to say, first of all... that I-- I really need your daughter, Chespi, in my life. And... I-I-I would like to... to ask both of you for permission to, uh... to-to-to-to m-marry your daughter, Chespi. Are you Catholic, son? Catholic? Oh, I'm-I'm very Catholic, sir. I, uh... Sometimes I think I'm a little too Catholic. I even wanted to become a priest. Gracias. Damn, homes, I can't believe I'm getting married, man. And me and Raymo always said, you need Chespi in your life. Chespi's a good girl. Thank God you listened to us. Mm-hm. Hey, bro, I don't know how you can eat tacos with cow tongue. That's some nasty-ass shit. Shit, man, that's good, bro. Hey, you want some? Man, get that shit out of my face. Don't you know that cows spend their whole day licking their big-ass balls? -You lying, man. -Mm-mm. Really? He ain't lying. Big-ass balls. Don't you study biology? Shit, where do you think the flavor comes from? Whew. Did you think you could hide from me, motherfucker? I ain't running from you, Gramps. You...you ain't what? You think you're big shit now, huh? Is that it? Hey, hey, hey, hey! 911! 911! Hey! 911, cabrón! Come on, hey! Hey, hey! Get your little ass on the rebound. You can count on it. -You okay, dawg? -Damn, dawg. I can't believe you stood up to that fucker, man. Fuck Gramps. Shit! Get you some! What's up, homes? Yeah! Are you hurt, baby? Are you hurt? -Nice shot. -Yeah. Shit. You see that pass, though, bro? Shit, that was cool as fuck. You should be in the NBA. Yeah, the National Bitch Association. Or the National Bizzatch Association. -National Beyotch Association. Hey, man, how come I never see you break a sweat? Because I'm cool as fuck, dawg. Some people just got it like that. No, man, but everybody got to sweat, man. Get all the shit out your system. -It's called toxins, bro. -Yeah. The motherfucking toxins, man. That's why people get colonics. You know, I can't help it, bro. It's genetic. -My mom don't sweat either. -See? There it is. Your mom-- Your whole family don't sweat. You guys got issues, dawg. You're supposed to be sweating. All right, just because you sweat like a pig. You need to go to the doctor and have them sweat glands checked. Hell, pigs don't sweat, bro. Look it up, bro. Hold on to this, homes. Hey, Big Joe. Hey, homey, could I have a drink of your 48? Didn't I tell you I was gonna catch your ass? I told you, Gramps, I ain't running from you anymore. You think you got balls now so you're gonna stand up to me? Hey, put the gun away, ése. Just squash the bullshit, man. Get the fuck out of here, Joe. I already told you this wasn't your beef. And I told you before, don't pull no gun on me unless you gonna use it, punk. I'll blow your motherfucking head all over this street. Want to see me walk my talk, motherfucker? Check this one out. This one's for you. Raymo! Fucking curse... Shit, they're on my... on my fucking arms. Oh, fuck. Oh! Oh, shit! Oh, fucking Raymo... I guess this is goodbye, Abuelito. I'm really going to miss you. Forgive me, Danny. Yo, I'm glad I caught you before you left, man. Yeah, me too, man. I'm just waiting for my cab to take me to the airport. How about you, dawg? How's the married life? -It's good, man. -Yeah? Yeah, I'm really happy, you know? Yeah. So listen, man, I've been thinking Well... we've been thinking, me and Chespi, that if it's a boy, we're gonna name him Ray. Ray's a good name. I really miss Raymo, you know. Yeah, me too, dawg. We had some good times on this couch, huh? The three of us grew up on this sofa. remember that time when we were playing that farting contest, and Raymo farted so much that he shit his pants. Yeah. How about when... when he fell asleep on the couch, and he woke up, and someone stole his shoes? His mom kicked his ass for, like, a week. She was barefoot for a week. Check it out. San Quentin. Big Joe. Life. Man, life's too fucking crazy, man. What'd he have to say? He said, make sure we take care of this sofa. Most of all, we got to take care of each other. Shit, but we'll still be in touch, right, Danny? Yeah, man. You're my road dog. New York's only, what, 3,000 miles away? I walk there, bro. Homey love, man? That's all we ever had, dawg. All right, man, you take care of yourself, all right? Say hi to Lucy for me, okay?
