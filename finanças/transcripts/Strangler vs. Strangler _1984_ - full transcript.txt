STRANGLER vs STRANGLER ﻿A COMEDY OF HORRORS ﻿Staring: ﻿Editing: ﻿Music by: ﻿Screenplay: ﻿Director of photography: ﻿Production manager: ﻿Executive producer: ﻿Directed by: ﻿I'd like all mankind ﻿to have just one neck ﻿with my hands around it. ﻿Karl Panzram, who ﻿murdered 23 people ﻿In Belgrade during ﻿the eighties. ﻿A town with nearly two ﻿million inhabitants, ﻿several hundred thousand cars, ﻿around ten museums, ﻿two radio stations. ﻿one TV center, ﻿and one big football club. ﻿The capital! ﻿Its inhabitants have ﻿yearned for years ﻿for their town to ﻿become a metropolis. ﻿At the moment when ﻿our story begins, ﻿good prospects exist for ﻿Belgrade to become one. ﻿You may be wondering what ﻿makes town a true metropolis. ﻿Is it traffic jams? ﻿Or gigantic new settlements? ﻿Or the construction of ﻿an ultra-modern subway? ﻿Some think it's the ﻿number of inhabitants ﻿Belgrade has more than a ﻿million inhabitants. ﻿Others stress the ﻿geographical position ﻿Belgrade is a bridge between ﻿The East and West. ﻿But a metropolis is a best ﻿defined by its crime chronicle. ﻿Broad boulevards, traffic jams ﻿and subways are all in vain. ﻿If there are no ﻿maniacs in a town, ﻿that town is not a metropolis! ﻿This is a story about ﻿unusual events ﻿which placed Belgrade ﻿alongside New York, ﻿London and Paris. ﻿Everything started in a ﻿harmless manner. ﻿Grab him. ﻿Exhibitionists appeared ﻿in Belgrade graveyards ﻿and shocked bereaved ﻿ladies. ﻿At Kalemegdan ﻿an authentic ﻿Belgrade type of voyeurs appeared. ﻿People called them ﻿"Rashomon" after ﻿a character in Kurosawa's ﻿famous film. ﻿Where one of the actors, ﻿is lurking in the bushes ﻿Another Rashomon! ﻿There were also some more ﻿serious cases. ﻿A Pole robbed the safe ﻿of the National Theater ﻿and took away 65 million ﻿dinars, though old ones. ﻿This incited a series ﻿of similar, ﻿more or less unsuccessful ﻿attempts. ﻿This is a robbery! ﻿Even the firemen helped ﻿two thieves to escape. ﻿And then, the Belgrade ﻿Phantom appeared! ﻿He's not our hero, ﻿though he amazed ﻿town with his wild ﻿driving in stolen Porsche, ﻿defying night after night ﻿the helpless police. ﻿The lift freak meant ﻿a step forward ﻿in Belgrade's development ﻿into a metropolis. ﻿Unbutton my fly! ﻿It is estimated that he ﻿attacked about 300 women, ﻿operating exclusively ﻿in lifts. ﻿There was also the ﻿tragicomic Pavle Siljak, ﻿who shot at women in furs ﻿with a home-made pistol. ﻿There were also rapes, ﻿murders out of revenge, ﻿jealousy and similar ﻿common motives, ﻿as well as many smaller ﻿or bigger robberies. ﻿But all this would not ﻿be sufficient ﻿to give Belgrade the ﻿status of a metropolis. ﻿The king of all criminals ﻿was needed for this: ﻿THE STRANGLER! ﻿This is what you get for ﻿not liking carnations! ﻿People like you don't ﻿deserve to live. ﻿His name was Pera Mitic. ﻿He was 48 years old. ﻿weighed 120 kilograms, ﻿and was 190 cm tall. ﻿He had never been married. ﻿This was his third ﻿victim! ﻿Come in! ﻿Where are your carnations. ﻿Did you lose them again? ﻿I sold all of them. ﻿Where is the money? ﻿- Here. ﻿There were 120 carnations! ﻿You went to the pastry ﻿shop again ﻿You're never satisfied, Mummy. ﻿Did you ever sell 120 ﻿carnations in one day? ﻿What! ﻿Raisin your voice ﻿at your parent? ﻿That's the thanks I get ﻿for taking you to the sea. ﻿Give me the stick! ﻿- No, mummy please! ﻿Then, I'll shut you ﻿up in the cistern ﻿No, not that, please ﻿How can you respect your ﻿your fellow man ﻿if you don't respect ﻿your mother? ﻿Kneel on the shells, ﻿you naughty boy! ﻿Ok, mummy ﻿Just, don't shout. ﻿It gives me a headache. ﻿No wonder you ﻿have headaches ﻿you lay in the sun 15 ﻿hours a day last summer. ﻿His mother's scolding would ﻿restore Pera to his normal state ﻿and make him forget ﻿all previous events. ﻿HOW PERA BECAME A STRANGLER ﻿(FLASHBACK) Pera strangled his first ﻿victim a few days ago. ﻿On that fateful ﻿evening, ﻿he was selling carnations ﻿in restaurants. ﻿But, at the time ﻿of our story, ﻿carnations were no ﻿longer in fashion. ﻿Some girls wouldn't let ﻿their boyfriends buy any, ﻿so that he often brought ﻿home less money ﻿and had to bear his ﻿mother's scolding. ﻿Give me five, young man. ﻿Thank you very much, ﻿madam. ﻿Thank you very much. ﻿Here you are, lovely ﻿red carnations. ﻿Fifty dinars a piece. ﻿Do you have any roses? ﻿I think carnations stink. ﻿I don't have any. ﻿Here you are, lovely ﻿red carnations. ﻿Sir! ﻿Here you are, for the ﻿young lady. ﻿ ﻿ ﻿Do you want one? ﻿Don't make me laugh! ﻿Take some, they are fresh, ﻿picked today. ﻿See how red they are, ﻿like blood. ﻿Don't mix blood and ﻿flowers. ﻿Give me five. ﻿I don't want any. ﻿I hate flowers. Men think they can solve ﻿everything with them. ﻿But flowers make life ﻿more beautiful. ﻿I don't want any money, ﻿take it as a present. ﻿Leave me alone. ﻿I told you I hate carnations. ﻿Some girls went so ﻿far as to refuse ﻿a gift of carnations ﻿from Pera. ﻿These are the ones he ﻿decided to punish. ﻿Fine "flower children" ﻿you are! ﻿He didn't know ﻿how he would do it, ﻿but he felt an urge ﻿to show these girls, ﻿that carnations are ﻿wonderful flowers ﻿that all people must ﻿love. ﻿Shall I sleep at ﻿our place ﻿Bye. ﻿Bad karma. ﻿Take a seat, Miss. ﻿You just sit down, ﻿old man! ﻿Pera's problem was that ﻿he was always tired. ﻿Hey, Fatso! ﻿This is the last stop! ﻿Sorry. ﻿After so much walking ﻿from place to place ﻿he could hardly ﻿stand on his feet. ﻿What's wrong with you? ﻿Why get upset because of ﻿stupid flower vendor? ﻿Go down and show that ﻿you're not afraid. ﻿You lost your ﻿carnations again. ﻿Here you go ﻿one blow for each ﻿carnation ﻿What do you want? ﻿No. ﻿Why are you ﻿following me? ﻿Go away or I'll call ﻿the police. ﻿And so, thanks to an overly ﻿brave and pretentious girl, ﻿Pera Mitic became ﻿a criminal. ﻿He killed his next victim ﻿the following night. ﻿Before that, he went to ﻿his favourite pastry shop ﻿to eat his fill ﻿of cream cakes. ﻿Good evening, Miss Dobrila. ﻿- Hello, Mr Pera. ﻿You should to change ﻿water more often. ﻿See how they've wilted. ﻿Carnations are delicate flowers. ﻿Why did you all ﻿dressed up today? ﻿Are you going to a ball? ﻿To the opera. ﻿I've never been ﻿to the opera. ﻿You're not going to sell ﻿all these flowers there? ﻿People who like opera buy flowers. ﻿That's why I ﻿like the opera. ﻿Bravo! ﻿Bravo! ﻿Bravo! ﻿A car will pick you up ﻿at the hotel at 5:20 am. ﻿Wake up call is at 4:20 am. ﻿The ticket is in ﻿your passport. ﻿Two man will see to your ﻿wardrobe at the airport. ﻿Signor Pierangelo will ﻿wait for you in Milan. ﻿With white Mercedes, ﻿and with a bouquet of roses. ﻿I told you not to put ﻿carnations in here! ﻿I hate their smell! ﻿What do you want? ﻿Carnations again! ﻿Get out of here! HOW PERA BECAME A STRANGLER ﻿(END OF FLASHBACK) ﻿ ﻿One murder can be ﻿an accidental act. ﻿But with his second murder, Pera ﻿Mitic announced the possibility ﻿that Belgrade would get ﻿a true strangler at last, ﻿and thus become ﻿metropolis. ﻿Go to bed at once, ﻿you good-for-nothing ﻿You roam around all night, ﻿while you could memorized ﻿the whole Gospel ﻿You prefer to stuff yourself ﻿with cream cakes! ﻿But, let's go back to ﻿the third murder, ﻿for it was one that ﻿alarmed the public. ﻿Is it true Belgrade ﻿has got the strangler? ﻿These are just rumors. ﻿There is no need for panic. ﻿Dear viewers, there's ﻿no need for panic. ﻿We have no proof this is ﻿a deed of a strangler. ﻿But doesn't it seem ﻿a bit strange to you ﻿that three murders have ﻿occurred recently, ﻿and that all three ﻿victims were women? ﻿Please, let the police ﻿do its work in peace. ﻿Turn off the camera! ﻿Jovanovic, take away ﻿their camera! ﻿Break it up! ﻿Turn off the camera! ﻿Come on, break it up! ﻿Break it up! ﻿The sight of the victim ﻿disturbed the citizens, especially the lonely ﻿youth Spiridon Kopicl, ﻿talented but still ﻿unknown rock musician. ﻿Spiro, what's the matter? ﻿He's choking ﻿Poor Spiro. ﻿Not like that! ﻿Dobrica! ﻿- Son! Son! ﻿It seems I overdid it. ﻿Quick, help him breathe! ﻿Mouth to mouth! ﻿Spiridon was a very ﻿shy young man. ﻿His family situation may ﻿have contributed to this. ﻿After the death of Spiridon's mother, ﻿Marije Kopicli ﻿his father, an eminent ﻿psychiatrist, ﻿married a beautiful ﻿nurse, Natalija. ﻿This is why Spiridon ﻿hated beautiful women. ﻿He's alive! ﻿Spiro's alive! ﻿Spiro! What's wrong ﻿with you? ﻿Spiro, have you gone mad? ﻿Spiro, Spiro! ﻿The boy is in shock! ﻿The strangler! ﻿He ordered ﻿me to do it! ﻿Daddy! ﻿I'm in telepathic ﻿touch with the strangler! ﻿Is this possible? ﻿If you love, Carmen, ﻿as I love you, ﻿encourage me now ﻿before the battle, ﻿I'll make you ﻿proud of me! ﻿Your love ﻿gives me strength. ﻿You know well, Escamilio, ﻿how much I love you. ﻿I never imagined ﻿how much my heart ﻿would ache! ﻿Mummy, it stings ﻿Not in the eyes. ﻿Mrs. Pospisilovic used to ﻿sing this so nicely. ﻿When he was alive, did ﻿daddy sing with you. ﻿Of course. Every Friday, ﻿we used to bathe you ﻿and we sang together. ﻿Mommy? ﻿And why did children ﻿tease me ﻿that you didn’t know ﻿who my daddy was? ﻿Christ! What rascal ﻿told you that? ﻿Jovica, Ljilja, Mirko, ﻿Zorica. ﻿- Be quiet! ﻿I'd strangle them with ﻿my own hands if I could! ﻿Stop! ﻿Enough of this racket ﻿A bit more easier. ﻿When will you stop ﻿playing the rebel? ﻿You think you are smart, ﻿don't you? ﻿- Yes, I do. ﻿Hey, you guys, enough ﻿of that. Let' play. ﻿Not before we know ﻿what we are playing. ﻿We have a perfect media ﻿project here, so cool it! ﻿Multimedia! ﻿Anyway, they like you ﻿guys with glasses. ﻿You must think up ﻿some more words, ﻿and identify yourself ﻿with the strangler. ﻿And so, looking for ﻿the words for his new song, Spiridon imagined ﻿he was the Strangler. ﻿This girl is the ﻿most beautiful, ﻿this girl I think of ﻿all the time. ﻿This girl is the only ﻿one I love. ﻿You meet such a girl ﻿only once, ﻿don't miss ﻿your chance. ﻿Touch her on the shoulder, and tell her... ﻿Baby, baby, close ﻿your eyes, ﻿Baby, baby, close ﻿your eyes now... ﻿Baby, baby, close ﻿your eyes, ﻿here comes the kiss. ﻿He looked for her ﻿all his life, ﻿he waited for her ﻿all his life. ﻿Now, with his hands around ﻿her neck, he whispers.. ﻿Baby, baby, close ﻿your eyes, ﻿Baby, baby ﻿Baby, baby, close ﻿your eyes, ﻿here comes the kiss. ﻿Please, let me hear ﻿the whole song. ﻿Since when do you ﻿like rock music? ﻿I thought you liked ﻿the opera. ﻿A man can change his ﻿taste, Miss Dobrila. ﻿How come this song made ﻿you change it? ﻿All of this sound ﻿sick to me. ﻿I find all these young people interesting. ﻿Oh, come on, they sing ﻿about a maniac ﻿who strangles women, ﻿as though he was their idol! ﻿Don't speak like that, ﻿Miss Dobrila. ﻿How do you know what ﻿kind of man he is? ﻿You see, I was thinking ﻿Why would someone just ﻿kill those poor girls? ﻿There must be ﻿a reason. ﻿What reason? He's ﻿simply mad man. ﻿Why do you insist: ﻿A mad man, a madman? ﻿As though we were ﻿all normal. ﻿A FEW HOURS LATER IN ANOTHER PART OF TOWN. ﻿I have seen him ﻿It's the strangler! ﻿Police! ﻿Police! ﻿The strangler! ﻿Mister, who will pay me ﻿for my lost time? ﻿I have a lot of ﻿work at home. ﻿And I sit here waiting ﻿to speak to someone. ﻿I am inspector ﻿Ognjen Strahinjic. ﻿I hope you will be ﻿able to help us. ﻿I want to help, ﻿but it seems ﻿no one here cares that ﻿I saw the strangler. ﻿Did you get a good ﻿look at him? ﻿My name isn't Mica ﻿Mojsilovic if I didn't. ﻿Are you sure you'd recognize ﻿him? ﻿- Absolutely! ﻿Our man have brought in ﻿about 20 suspects ﻿they found near ﻿the scene of the crime. ﻿Your task is to look ﻿at them carefully. ﻿If you're quite sure the ﻿man you saw is among them ﻿give me a secret sign ﻿by nodding your head. ﻿What if he sees me? ﻿- That's impossible. ﻿They'll be blinded by the light, ﻿and I am with you. ﻿And who is going ﻿to pay me? ﻿This is your duty as ﻿a citizen. ﻿You don't say. ﻿And you ﻿get a salary for this. ﻿Come on, I wasn't ﻿born yesterday. ﻿Will you help us or not? ﻿- Show the money first. ﻿Hand over 500 dinars, ﻿and let's go to work. ﻿It's torn. ﻿Is it all right now? ﻿- Fine. Fire away now. ﻿Your fried fish, ﻿inspector. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Bring in the first ﻿group. ﻿Where did you find ﻿that hunch-back? ﻿Whom could he strangle? ﻿You must be crazy! ﻿With a police like this ﻿he could strangle ﻿half a Belgrade if ﻿I hadn't seen him. ﻿Please, be more discreet, ﻿it's in your interest. ﻿Next group. ﻿You must be joking! ﻿That man was ﻿enormous. ﻿Let those poor creeps ﻿go get some sleep. ﻿Are you sure none of them is.. ﻿- Listen , use your brain. ﻿This lot couldn't ﻿strangle a fly. ﻿Give me five ﻿tall ones! ﻿Gentlemen, policemen, ﻿I never separate from my ﻿basket of carnations. ﻿How will the lady recognize ﻿me without it? ﻿Silence! Be quiet, ﻿you fool! ﻿As you say. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Why are you nodding your ﻿head? ﻿-The secret sign! ﻿Secret sign? ﻿Separate ﻿him from the others. ﻿We have him at last. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿I am just without the basket. ﻿No, not him! ﻿That's Pera, the flower ﻿vendor, don't you know? ﻿You see, the lady recognized me. ﻿She likes carnations. ﻿Why did you nod your head ﻿then, Mrs. Mojsilovic? ﻿Because of that, ﻿bald one ﻿He must be the killer. ﻿He's horrible! ﻿Do you recognize him? ﻿- Sure, I'm not blind. ﻿He's the strangler! ﻿I'll sign that. ﻿Jovanovic, take 500 dinars ﻿back from Mrs. Mojsilovic. ﻿Markovic, put back ﻿your uniform. ﻿No one was as sad and ﻿lonely that evening ﻿as inspector Ognjen Strahinjic. ﻿All his efforts to find ﻿a link, a common motive, ﻿that would lead to ﻿the murderer, have failed. ﻿The pressure from ﻿the public increased. ﻿The inspector saw the frequent sneers ﻿of his younger assistants. ﻿He knew there was talk ﻿that he should retire. ﻿He knew this was ﻿his last chance ﻿to gain back his ﻿former reputation. ﻿Good evening to all our ﻿faithful listeners. ﻿Our guest tonight ﻿is Spiridon Kopicl, ﻿the singer of the ﻿controversial "Symbols". ﻿His song "The Belgrade Strangler" ﻿has caused a lot of ﻿talks these days due ﻿to its bizarre text. ﻿Let's ask him what will happen ﻿at his concert in "The Brewery"? ﻿Will the girls feel safe in an ﻿atmosphere of horror? ﻿And why will the concert ﻿be on Friday the 13 Th? ﻿The Strangler is sure ﻿to come to the concert, ﻿I want everyone ﻿to know this. ﻿For, in a way, this is ﻿also his song. ﻿What have you got ﻿against girls? ﻿And why do you like ﻿the Strangler so much ﻿that you have dedicated ﻿a song to him? ﻿Have you ever tried to ﻿strangle girl yourself? ﻿No, I never had ﻿that opportunity. ﻿I can't touch their necks. ﻿They keep their eyes open. ﻿Let's give you a chance. ﻿I'm not scared of men. ﻿Try to touch my neck. ﻿I'll even close my eyes. ﻿Dear listeners, now you'll ﻿all hear strangling. ﻿What do you feel? ﻿Do you want to strangle me? ﻿Yes. ﻿Where are you going? ﻿Who gave you a license? ﻿Idiot! ﻿Give me the phone ﻿To call the police! ﻿- I'm the police. ﻿A call for you! ﻿That wasn't ﻿a funny joke. ﻿Yes. ﻿"Rockolade" here. ﻿We're listening. ﻿This is inspector ﻿Ognjen Strahinjic. ﻿What are you up to ﻿in "Rockolade"? ﻿In a program listened ﻿by so many teenagers ﻿you promote stupid ﻿song applauding crime. ﻿You're all a bunch of ﻿maniacs that I'll. ﻿This is a strangest ﻿experience in my life! ﻿You're really not ﻿quite normal! ﻿Play the outro. ﻿- Wait! Let me explain. ﻿I'll stop the concert, if ﻿it's the last thing I do! ﻿A concert? ﻿Why not? ﻿Hello! ﻿Find me 20 women ﻿agents at once. ﻿Yes! ﻿Oppressed with problems ﻿he couldn't cope with, ﻿Spiridon wandered ﻿around the town. ﻿The incident in "Rockolade" ﻿raised many questions ﻿which sought ﻿an answer. ﻿Obsessed by ﻿the Strangler, ﻿waiting tensely for the ﻿concert, he asked himself ﻿Who am I? Where do I come ﻿from? Where am I going? ﻿What binds me so strongly ﻿to that Strangler? ﻿I feel like an instrument ﻿of an unknown force. ﻿Sometimes I think ﻿that I am - HE. ﻿I am Spiridon Kopicl ﻿I'm ordinary ﻿young man! ﻿I am normal! ﻿I'm in love. ﻿Girls, we are faced with ﻿a difficult task. ﻿Maniacs multiply like ﻿fleas in this town. ﻿It is my assumption that this ﻿concert will attract them ﻿as honey the bees. ﻿Rodoljub, is that you? ﻿We couldn't find 20 women, ﻿inspector, so I volunteered. ﻿Not bad, not bad. ﻿At least, some use from ﻿your film ideas. ﻿But remember: maniacs ﻿are mad, not stupid. ﻿This won't do. You must ﻿also feel like a woman. ﻿I understand. ﻿- No, you don't. ﻿You must identify with ﻿a woman's personality. ﻿You must acquire ﻿a female psyche. ﻿You must repeat ﻿to yourself ﻿I am a woman, ﻿I am a woman! ﻿I am a woman, ﻿I am a woman! ﻿I am a woman, ﻿I am a woman! ﻿I am a woman! ﻿FRIDAY THE 13th ﻿What's the matter? ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Why are you rooted ﻿to one spot? ﻿Move around, dance, sing! ﻿You're a woman. ﻿I am a woman! ﻿Show off, creep, I ﻿always dance alone! ﻿Look out, this ﻿one's tall. ﻿Be a nice little girl! ﻿Fresh red carnations ﻿for the little girl. ﻿I shit on your ﻿carnations! ﻿Scatter over the area and ﻿act like a lonely girl. ﻿Come on, let's go. ﻿Everyone was so ﻿kind tonight, ﻿they all bought carnations ﻿except you. ﻿My last carnation ﻿ending like this! ﻿This boy isn't normal. ﻿Bravo! On core! ﻿Sleep well and dream about the Belgrade Strangler. ﻿YOUNG KOPICL MAYBE A MURDERER? ﻿Dove 12, receiving you. ﻿Are you at your post? ﻿According to our plan, ﻿inspector. ﻿Act carefully, someone ﻿could be watching. ﻿Don't underestimate ﻿any passer-by. ﻿Each one could be the Strangler. ﻿- Yes, Sir. ﻿Hey, turtledove. ﻿Oh, where are you ﻿going? ﻿To the party? ﻿Looking for some action? ﻿Do you want some beer? ﻿Why not. ﻿I told you I don’t like that. ﻿Cops! ﻿This is Dove 12. ﻿- Anything new? ﻿No, but I was nearly ﻿raped by two creeps. ﻿Excellent, keep it out. ﻿You're the only one who ﻿attracted a male so far. ﻿The other doves have ﻿nothing to report. ﻿Keep it up, and ﻿repeat constantly ﻿I am a woman, ﻿I am a woman... ﻿I am a woman... I ﻿am a woman... ﻿I am a man! ﻿I am a man! ﻿Mummy! ﻿Dove 12! Can you hear me? ﻿Are you there? ﻿Rodoljub! ﻿Rodoljub, can you ﻿hear me? ﻿Dove 12! Can you hear me? ﻿Quick! To post 12! ﻿All doves: the Hawk ﻿has attacked Dove 12 ﻿Run to its nest! ﻿What's going on tonight? ﻿Everyone's going crazy! ﻿The Strangler ﻿has struck again. ﻿Spiro, stop boring me ﻿with that story. ﻿It's in very ﻿poor taste. ﻿I admit your music is great, ﻿but your image is idiotic! ﻿You think I was fooling ﻿around on the radio? ﻿We were in parapsychologic ﻿touch with the Strangler! ﻿Now I've really had ﻿enough. ﻿Go home.pester your daddy with ﻿your juvenile madness! ﻿Look at the newspapers ﻿tomorrow, ﻿you'll see what juvenile ﻿madness is! ﻿Grab him to the right Milojka! ﻿Easy, George. Ogi has ﻿brought you some fish. ﻿Some fish for ﻿little George. ﻿Eat your fill, this may be ﻿our last supper. ﻿The death of Rodoljub ﻿was the worst blow ﻿in the career of Ognjen Strahinjic. ﻿His whole investigation ﻿had gone down the drain. ﻿In his mind he kept hearing the ﻿words of his closest assistant ﻿Mr. Strahinjic, can't ﻿you see we are dealing ﻿with a mass murderer, ﻿a psychopath? ﻿All the elements point ﻿in that direction. ﻿All his victims were women and ﻿they were all wearing trousers. ﻿There was no sign of ﻿sexual assault, ﻿they were all strangled ﻿by a very strong man, ﻿who just used his hands. ﻿- So what? ﻿If we catch this maniac, ﻿we'll make history! ﻿A feeling of guilt due ﻿to Rodoljub's death ﻿was destroying ﻿inspector Strahinjic. ﻿He thought life wasn't ﻿worth living any longer. ﻿Disappointed, shaken ﻿and dejected, ﻿he decided to commit ﻿suicide. ﻿Good-bye, George. ﻿Maybe there's another ﻿better world, ﻿where we'll meet again. Don't do it, Ogi. Th﻿is society needs you. Who will revenge Rodoljub? Only you can stop the Strangler. ﻿You are right, George. ﻿That's what Rodoljub ﻿would have said. ﻿If I let him down ﻿when he was alive, ﻿I won't do it now ﻿that he's dead. ﻿My clever George! ﻿Tonight marks the beginning of ﻿Ognjen Starhinjic's new life. ﻿As usual, Pera Mitic didn't ﻿remember the previous events. ﻿Friday, the 13th didn't ﻿exist for him. ﻿But the place where he ﻿work up made him guess ﻿that he had massed up ﻿something again, ﻿and that he could expect ﻿his mother's scolding. ﻿My God! ﻿I thought I asked you ﻿not to walk around naked! ﻿Sorry, daddy. ﻿Halo,halo. ﻿I just wanted to tell you ﻿to look at my report ﻿on your concert in ﻿tonight's "Mosaic". ﻿It may help you solve ﻿some of your problems. ﻿And yeah... ﻿Halo. ﻿..you needn't buy ﻿today's newspaper. ﻿There's nothing there ﻿about the Strangler. ﻿Bye. ﻿Halo. ﻿Go on pumping! ﻿Mummy, let me just hear ﻿this song I like. ﻿Pump, when I tell you! ﻿Mummy, not so loud, I want ﻿to hear this song. ﻿You should listen to ﻿God's song, you rascal! ﻿Mummy, not so loud, ﻿please. ﻿The Belgrade far out ﻿crowd has a new fashion. ﻿Evil has been popular ever ﻿since the Sex pistols. ﻿Our pseudo-avant-garde ﻿rock singers offer us ﻿their version Os someone ﻿else's ideas. ﻿After the "Nazi-Punk" ﻿and the "Serbian Caps" ﻿Spiridon Kopicl, the leader ﻿of the "Symbols", ﻿offers us an innovation ﻿the strangling of women. ﻿The fact that a real ﻿maniac exists in Belgrade ﻿amuses the "Symbols" and ﻿helps their morbid image. ﻿What has Spiridon Kopicl ﻿against the women? ﻿Women were... ﻿Let's hear this lucid ﻿statement once again. ﻿Unfortunately, our public bites ﻿at this morbid bait ﻿which Kopicl and CO. use to ﻿hide their creative impotence. ﻿Everyone in the "Brewery", ﻿had a great time, ﻿without thinking ﻿of the implications. ﻿The girls were buying ﻿carnations, ﻿apparently amused by ﻿their own funeral. ﻿See for yourselves what ﻿our cameras recorded. ﻿That's me! ﻿Mummy, that's me! ﻿Mummy, I remember now! ﻿I was at the concert and ﻿I sold all my carnations. ﻿Look mummy, that's me ﻿at the concert! ﻿That's me. ﻿Mummy, my headaches ﻿terribly. ﻿Mummy, my head aches. ﻿Play something. ﻿Play mummy, please. ﻿I have a terrible headache. ﻿Here, I'll pump. ﻿Sing, mummy, sing. ﻿Sing something, mummy. ﻿You have a nice voice. ﻿Perica, my son, ﻿you are ill. ﻿I am ill, ﻿my head aches. ﻿I am ill, very ill. ﻿Spiro, I brought you ﻿some rice pudding. ﻿For God's sake, Spiro, ﻿when will you stop ﻿playing with that ﻿horrible doll? ﻿I'm sure many girls would ﻿like to be in her place. ﻿I told you hundred times not ﻿to come in without knocking. ﻿I'll show you who ﻿Spiridon Kopicl is! ﻿I'll show you ﻿who is impotent! ﻿Torn apart by contradictory ﻿feelings, provoked by ﻿Sofia's report, Spiridon was ﻿on the edge of despair. ﻿He felt he should ﻿do something. ﻿Finally, he decided to ﻿take direct action. ﻿He took scissors ﻿and started ﻿to cut out letters ﻿from the newspapers. ﻿At first it looked like ﻿an anonymous love letter. ﻿But the letter begun for ﻿the emcee of "Rocklade" ﻿turned into a letter to ﻿inspector Ognjen Strahinjic. ﻿"The next one's on Friday. ﻿The Strangler." ﻿We finally have something ﻿tangible in my hands. ﻿The killer has become conceited, ﻿and this will make ﻿him less careful. ﻿We have three days ﻿to get ready. ﻿This time, there must ﻿be no mistakes. ﻿I think this letter has no ﻿bearing on our case. ﻿This sends some fool. ﻿Mitrovic, you haven't taken ﻿this case over yet. ﻿You think I don't know ﻿you're out to get me? ﻿I won't let you undermine ﻿this action! ﻿Last Friday, the Strangler ﻿attacked on Friday. ﻿I see no reason why he ﻿shouldn't do it again, ﻿since he informed us ﻿that he would. ﻿So, you're all free ﻿till tomorrow morning. ﻿Have a good sleep and get ﻿ready for the work ahead. ﻿What if the Strangler ﻿wanted to confuse us? ﻿Mitrovic, don't put a spoke ﻿in my wheel. ﻿Let me work out the plan ﻿of action in peace. ﻿You can go, but I'll ﻿stay awake. ﻿And now - get going! ﻿There's nothing to get ﻿hold of here. ﻿That man kills without ﻿any reason of sense! ﻿Thousands of women wear ﻿trousers in this town. ﻿So, how can I predict which one ﻿of them will be the next victim? ﻿And now, Johnny Stulic and ﻿his latest hit! ﻿Rockolade invites you to ﻿phone in your requests. ﻿Our number is still ﻿656-353. ﻿And now, Johnny Stulic and ﻿"Oh, my God, what a terrible film." ﻿You have a call. ﻿Yes, Rockolade. ﻿Go ahead. ﻿What do you have against ﻿my carnations? ﻿Excuse me? ﻿What are you talking about? ﻿- You know what I'm talking about. ﻿You put me on the film for TV. ﻿You criticized my carnations. ﻿That's not nice. ﻿I don’t like girls who ﻿hate carnations. ﻿I really don't like carnations. ﻿Turn down the radio, ﻿there are disturbances. ﻿There are no disturbances. ﻿It's me eating cakes. ﻿Beside carnations, I ﻿really like to eat cakes. ﻿And I'd also like to hear ﻿my favourite song ﻿"The Belgrade Strangler". ﻿Rockolade only fulfills ﻿the requests ﻿of the listeners who ﻿state their names. ﻿It wasn't nice of you ﻿to criticize me on TV. ﻿I know you did it for your career. ﻿That wasn't very smart of you. ﻿- Please, tell us your name. ﻿No, I won't. ﻿- Dear listeners, ﻿I think this is just one more ﻿of Spiridon Kopicl's ﻿witless jokes. ﻿But since he likes his ﻿song so much, ﻿Rockolade will fulfill ﻿his wish. ﻿Here's for the last time ﻿"The Belgrade Strangler". ﻿Inspector. ﻿There's a dead girl ﻿down below. ﻿What does she want? ﻿- He wanted to say she is dead. ﻿What does that have ﻿to do with me? ﻿Well, it's another victim ﻿of the Strangler. ﻿That's not true! ﻿That's not true! ﻿What do you know? ﻿You all ﻿want to be inspectors! ﻿It's not true! ﻿It's not true! ﻿It cant be! ﻿He wouldn't lie to me! ﻿The Strangler wouldn't ﻿lie to me! ﻿The Strangler wouldn't ﻿lie to me. ﻿We must just let him ﻿work off his aggression. ﻿All these murders, ﻿contradictory theories, ﻿his obsession with ﻿"the strangler", ﻿overly increased his ﻿tension. ﻿He needs an outlet, ﻿that's quite simple. ﻿Shall I tell him he's ﻿no more on the case? ﻿That's out of question! ﻿He mustn't find that out now. ﻿At present, his condition ﻿is nearly normal. ﻿He'll be as quiet as ﻿a bug when he comes out. ﻿I need panthers, ﻿not little bugs. ﻿He won't be capable of ﻿working on the case. ﻿But let him think he's ﻿still in charge. ﻿That's very important ﻿for his recovery. ﻿Damn it, Dobrica, how ﻿will I manage that? ﻿We're not a bunch of actors. ﻿- I don't know. ﻿It all depends on how much ﻿you want to get well. ﻿But remember: another ﻿blow like this, ﻿and he will definitely ﻿end up in here. ﻿Please, sit down. ﻿Rest a bit, sit Dow ﻿Rest a bit, sit down. ﻿You may go now. ﻿Would you like some juice? ﻿- Thank you, you're very kind. ﻿Here you go. ﻿This juice is delicious. ﻿Where did you buy it? ﻿Ognjen... ﻿- Yes, Gane.. ﻿Ognjen, how do you feel? ﻿Fantastic! ﻿Fantastic! ﻿As a panther ready ﻿to jump. ﻿Well catch him tonight. ﻿you can be sure of that. ﻿I was thinking ﻿about it ﻿and I could find no weak ﻿spot in the whole plan. ﻿Please, excuse me. ﻿I have a lot of work to do. ﻿If you don't mind, ﻿I think I'll go now. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿You just go and ﻿do your work. ﻿You can take my car ﻿and driver. ﻿See the inspector off ﻿while I make the call. ﻿Follow that guy ﻿on roller-skates. ﻿THE YOUNG KOPICL ﻿POSSIBLE MURDERER ﻿THE YOUNG KOPICL ﻿MURDERER ﻿Get of my back.

Oh, God! Was Belgrade ﻿destined to become the scene of ﻿the most morbid, the most incredible crime ﻿story of the eighties? ﻿Give my son back his ear! ﻿Help! ﻿Daddy! ﻿The Strangler! ﻿Open up, Daddy! ﻿You bite and then call ﻿my son a maniac! ﻿Police! Help! ﻿The Strangler! ﻿My son is not a maniac. ﻿My son is not maniac, ﻿you good-for-nothing. ﻿I'll show you! ﻿I'll find you! ﻿You'll give back Pera's ear! ﻿Give me the ear! ﻿At the moment when ﻿Pera Mitic ripped off his ear, ﻿the hum in Spiridon's ﻿head crystallized ﻿into the chords of ﻿his first symphony, ﻿which, a few years later, ﻿would make him a famous composer. ﻿Known as the man who rid ﻿Belgrade of the Strangler ﻿Spiridon lived as ﻿an eminent citizen. ﻿Sofia was believed to be ﻿Pera's last victim, ﻿which in fact, she might ﻿well have been. ﻿Dr. Kopicl's sudden ﻿death in his marital bed, ﻿left in Spiridon's care his ﻿bereft step-mother, Natalija. ﻿The first performance of ﻿his symphony, ﻿conducted by the composer ﻿was shown on TV, ﻿so that millions of ﻿viewers could enjoy it. ﻿The only ones who could ﻿have said something more ﻿about the genesis of ﻿Spiridon's masterpiece ﻿were the unlucky ﻿inspector Strahinjic... ﻿George! George! ﻿Now I am sure ﻿Young Kopicl is ﻿the Strangler! ﻿and the corpse of ﻿Pera's mother, forgotten ﻿in a cistern, in front ﻿of a dead TV set. ﻿Such is life! ﻿Some stranglers are born ﻿under lucky star, ﻿and some are not.
