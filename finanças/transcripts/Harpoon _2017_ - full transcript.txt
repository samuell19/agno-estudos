Subtitles by explosiveskull IT'S TOO EARLY, WHAT IS IT? I'LL BE THERE TONIGHT AT 7. NO. COME EARLIER. I'LL BE WITH SOMEONE AT 7 P.M. WITH WHOM? SOMEONE. I'VE GOT PEOPLE TODAY. AT 5 P.M. CONFIRMED? CONFIRMED. I GET OUT FROM SCHOOL AND DROP BY. $1,500. OK. KISS. Good morning. Why don't you check over there? Did you know this guy pays for hookers? I saw him in his car with a girl. Let me check your bag. Cami, don't let him. - Go away. - Excuse me? I'm not showing you my bag. It's private. Romera, let me see your bag. Go away! Everyone is showing me... Romera. Come here... Go away! Romera, come here! Romera! Come out, Romera! Romera, come out. Come out, Romera, please. Come out of there! Could you please come out? Come on! Romera! I'm talking about the name of a school project. The title "Pre-Columbian America" has to do with an ideology and organization. No, no. I'm not talking about that. You can't talk about a pre-Columbian period because we're splitting history between invaders and invaded. Let's do this. For next week do some research on the subject of the name of America, and we'll read it here with all your colleagues. The name is the first identity. Maybe we don't like it. We didn't get to choose it. My name's Sonya. I don't know if that's the name I like best. But you can choose the name of the work. So, be creative. Don't call it "School Project number two" Suárez! Think about a title that tells us something. If you're working on the history of pre-Columbian peoples, find something interesting about that story and come up with a creative name. The title is the first impression we have about a piece of work. For instance, when you go to the movies. Would you be interested in seeing a movie called "Movie number 40"? I'm not interested in reading a school project called School Project... …number two. Or this one, for instance. "Agriculture in Mayan times." Quite creative, right? - What is it? - We need to talk. - I can't. - I need to talk to you now. No. I'll wait for you in my office. Are you out of your mind? How can you chase a student around the school like that? You almost broke a door, Germán. Who do you think you are? You don't know what happened before that. What am I supposed to do now? Do I take your side or the parents' side? Take their side. I know what I have to tell them. You turn everyone against you with these attitudes. I'm tired, Sonya. Of the students, of these walls, of you, of everyone. Being tired does not give you the right to chase a student. You couldn't control anybody here. They would laugh in your face. I'm not defending you anymore. Tell me what I have to do? Dora found that in the girls' restroom two days ago. What does the student Romera have to do with this? All students show us their bags, but she runs away. What do you make of that? Did you check the restroom? Go check it out and call her parents. They called her mother, but she was not there. She's staying with some relatives. I'd rather talk about this with her mother when she gets back. I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO SLEEP. SENT YOU GOT OLD. I COULDN'T GO TODAY. WORK. MAYBE TOMORROW. SENT LET ME KNOW BEFORE. KISS. She always sacrificed herself for me. My approach was to make an effort, my best to try to stand out. Since I was very little I've always wanted her to be proud of me. A trip abroad was 3,800 dollars, for instance. I didn't have that money. I didn't have a way to get it somewhere. Also, one of the subjects that... Let me check your bag. Here. Come! What is it? Give me! Come on, Cata, hit her! Hit her harder, Cata! Let her go, Cata! Let her go! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop it, Cata! That's enough, Cata! Come here. Are you ok? Keep calm, it's ok. Can you get up? Get up. Olga knew you had something in your bag. She knew something. That's why you fought. Why didn't you show me your bag yesterday? What? What? What are you going to do? Hello. What's up, Lore? Fine, and you? Fine. Have you seen Mica? I'M HERE... Are you looking for Mica? Yes. Wait for her in the car. No, no. Wait for her in the car. Are you taking me for an idiot? What does he want? What's going on? What's the problem with him? I'm leaving. I'm leaving this place. I told you I have a daughter. I'm leaving to be with her. When are you leaving? As soon as possible. Two weeks. One month tops. What do they say? I have to leave them another girl. There always has to be another one. I won't leave until I find another girl. Rubén wants me to stay. He still chooses me. You? I choose you too. I didn't mean that. I meant if you can't find another girl. Another girl for what? You work at a school. Full of girls. Are you serious? I'm kidding. Can I have one? Here. Take the whole pack. Before I go, let's have some mates, at least, OK? Of course. - Bye. - Bye. Excuse me. Do you have a minute? Several parents called. Apparently they heard about Cata. They uploaded some videos on the internet. What videos? The kids were recording when she locked herself up in the restroom. Now the parents are calling and I really don't know what to tell them. Arguello, the parents are talking about pressing charges. What charges? - What's going on? - Nothing. The parents are threatening with pressing charges. Keep an eye on the children, please. Germán, what are you going to do? What are you going to do? We're going to tell them about the syringe. What are you talking about? You have to set up a meeting with the parents now. We're going to explain what happened. A student brought a syringe. Endangered the girls. That's it. Risk of diseases, infections and what not. This isn't the first time they've threatened with pressing charges. It's better this way. They'll learn what their children do. You can't smoke in here. Martín confirmed about the river. Julio is coming too. It's all right. Stay. We haven't talked to your parents because I thought we could sort this out between us. You know what I'm talking about, right? I'm not going to chase you around. I just want you to tell me what you have in there. Listen, Cata. If we talk about this now between us, and you tell me what you have in that bag, it's done, it's over, end of story. If not, I will talk to your parents and I will expel you. No. You're going to get expelled. Fine. But before I get expelled, you will show me what you have in your backpack. What is this for? For the lips. Some girls have thin lips. Are you saying you inject this into your classmates? Who? Who? Her? Or her? Here. Take it, Cata. Go ahead. Go ahead! Look, how cute he is. Go and talk to him. Wait, Martín! Come here, Martín! It's all right! Here, hold this. Martín, wait! Come here! Come on, Cata, get up here! Come on, hurry up! Come on! SURGERY ROOM No, she's not my daughter, doctor. I'm the principal of the school she attends. They called me because they can't find her mother. It looks like she's in the capital. The thing is we had to drain her upper lip. She had like an oily substance. Do you know if the mother has some kind of health insurance or something? I just told you we can't find her mother. Fine. There's a pharmacy nearby. You will get her this. It's to prevent infections. One pill every 12 hours. One before going to bed and one before lunch. We put some cotton to prevent the bleeding. Don't worry. It's nothing. Is that yours? Give it to me. Let me have it. I'll carry it. I don't know, Gastón. I don't care. It's only natural they rebel. Whatever. It's the age, I don't know. But they should at least rebel for something. Say something valuable. Mine spend all day with the cell phone sending porn pictures and videos. I don't see any transgression in that. I've got this student, Olga... She gets mixed up in subjects she doesn't even understand, just to fight me. She talks to me about America and the neo-colonization and whatever. It's transgression just for the sake of it. I think it's healthy to get a little mad. They are not robots. I'd rather they fight with you than with each other. Look, if I can get a student to defend their ideas coherently, to rebel for something, I'll be happy. Here he comes. - And Cata? - I don't know. So? She's downstairs. I got her some medicines. It's nothing serious. What happened with the parents? Her mother is not in. She's selling clothes in the capital. She won't be back today. She asked me to take her with some relatives, where she's staying. Here's the address and the phone numbers, just in case. It's a bit far, after the bridges. Sonya, I can't be in charge of this girl. I went to the hospital and that's it. I'm sorry. Germán, wait. Listen to me. Go and talk to them. Let them see everything's all right, that you took care of Cata, that you took her to the hospital, bought her medicines. That you brought her to their doorstep. Let them see everything is fine. I don't know, talk to them. Now more than ever you need to have some parents on your side. And some teachers too. Let's go. Write down my phone number. - 1544062018. - Hold on. 154406... I'm going to talk to your relatives so they won't worry, I'll be right back. Are you sure this is it? Cata. Cata. Listen. You're staying with me until your relatives show up, OK? Do you have any idea where they might be, at what time they're coming back or anything? What's the matter, Cata? You don't want to get back home? Is that it? Are you hungry? Yes, but I can't because of the... - Are you mad at me? - Not at all. Corn. Disgusting. It's yours. Give me a napkin. What's in yours? Ham and cheese. At school they're saying you were with a hooker. What? That they saw you with a hooker. That she was sitting where I'm sitting now. You were fucking her, right? Don't you find it gross? I mean, fucking a girl everybody fucks? What do you think? That the kids you hang out with have not fucked someone else? What about you? How many have you had? You fuck some hooker and you think you know all the girls. You're a joke. A hooker is a person, girl. Like you, like me, like your mom. She works, she has children, she drinks mate. The more I think about it the less I can find a logical explanation for you injecting your lip, and injecting your classmates lips. Look at yourself. Look at that lip. Do you know what rejection is? Do you know what it means to look in the mirror and know you're that? That's how you have to go to school, with everyone staring at you, everyone comparing you, you comparing yourself with the others? Upload a picture and pray for more than ten likes, and that the skank that dyes her hair and wears makeup gets 120? And everyone writes "beautiful, hot, divine." Do you know what the hard part is here? The hard part is that you take this everywhere and it doesn't go away. Your eyes, your nose, your eyebrows, your lips, your belly, your ass, your tits, your body. It doesn't go away. But it can be corrected. No one will like you with that shit you put on your lips. - Let me see. - Don't touch me. Besides, you're a beautiful girl. Actually, you're quite ugly. - You're super ugly. - Yeah, sure. Go on. God, you're so ugly. Wait here. I've been waiting for an hour. What are you doing here? Did you get my message? No. What message? - Who's that? - A student. Just out of the hospital. - What happened to her? - Nothing serious. She's staying with me until her parents get back. Don't give me that look. I came to say goodbye. To eat, have a drink. Yes? Yes, she's staying here with me until her mother or her relatives get back. Did they call you? I've been calling them, but no answer. Who are you with? A friend. She's out there talking to Cata. - A friend? - Yes, a friend. Which grade are you in? Second year. Math is tough, huh? What are you studying now? Inversely proportional magnitudes. Inversely proportional magnitudes. That's bullshit. I know. Is it a coed school? Yes. Boys and girls? Yes. Coed. So, what's up? About what? Is there a boy there? No. So boring. What do you do? I work at a bar. As a waitress. Is there a man? Well, not a man, a boy? There's one. - What's his name? - Julio. Julio. Isn't that a common name? I mean, because of the month. No. You're cute. Thanks. You have such a beautiful smile. Yeah, but the braces fuck it up. Let me see. Come here. Show me. No. But it's fucked up right there. It's all right. Your hair is so smooth. Yeah, it's kind of fucked up too. It gets all tangled up a lot. It looks better like that. But I use it like this. You don't always have to wear it like you want. Why not? In this case, because of Julio. Can I give you some advice? If you want something from a man, stare right into his eyes and ask for what you want. You do that? Germán! He'll come. Call me if anything comes up. Bye. Kiss. - Germán! - Coming! What? Beer and a glass. Is that possible? Glass and beer. Promise that when you see Julio you will stare into his eyes, and you will ask him for what you want. Is this the school's table? No. Of course it is. This is the school's table. He stole the school's table. I brought it to get it fixed. Right, right. The leg is broken. - Come on. - There we go. - There we go. You weren't expecting that. Come on, come on. Here we go! Point! Take that! Point! Come on! Point! Jab, jab, straight! Jab, jab, jab, straight! There. Come on! Jab, jab, jab, straight! Straight! Jab, jab! If there's nothing left to wake up to, And I have being left alone in this short trip. If not all wounds are closed yet, Why would I bother opening them again? I've received several punches in my life, Not only at school, also from my family. I don't usually trust anyone that comes near me. Experience taught me to shut myself and be strong. My friends I can count with the fingers in one hand, and with two all the ones that have let me down. They were supposed to be with me always, Never leave me and let me fall. Now I see myself falling while they grow. There's not one place where I don't feel dead, But I don't want to die. Not even that would be worth it at this point. It seems rather stimulating, but I simply gave up. If there's nothing left. Nothing makes sense no more. Whatever was left worth taking is not there anymore. If I get lost today, no one will come for me tomorrow. In the darkness an exit showed itself, A company that would transit this life with me, They showed me time is not always what matters, That some people go and new ones come. I'd never decided to confess it to someone, Not without expecting to be stabbed in the back. This time I got this one shot, And I won't let it go for anything in this world. If there's nothing left to wake up to, And I have being left alone in this short trip. If not all wounds are closed yet, Why would I bother opening them again? I don't want to dream again for more lies. I don't want to smile for unfelt words. I don't want to be realistic and lack ignorance. I don't want to be ignorant and just let myself fall. Hello? Hello, Mica. Pick up! Is Cata with you? Hello? Hello, Mica. Can you pick up the phone, please? I need to know if Cata is with you. Hello! Fuck. What? - Have you seen Mica? - No, I haven't. - What do you mean? Where's Mica? - I don't know. What happened? What's the name of the man that pimps her? - Rubén. - That's the one. Where's Rubén? - I don't know where he is. Stop. - Tell me where Rubén is. - I don't know where he is. - How you don't know? Tell me! Stop! Let me go, you motherfucker! Stop, stop! Easy! What's the matter? - Where is Rubén? - I have no idea, man. Cata! Stop. Take it easy. Have a beer and chill. She took a 14 year old girl. If I ever get a 14 year old girl you'll never get her back. So have a beer and chill. I'll exchange her! Tell Rubén I can get him a substitute! - Hello, Sonya. - Where the fuck are you? What happened? Cata's mom called the school. She hasn't heard from her since yesterday. She's nervous. She never made it to her relatives'. Listen, don't do anything, don't say a word, Sonya. Didn't you leave her with her relatives? Of course I took her to them, but they were not there. You called me yourself. I told you she was going to stay with me. I need your help, Sonya. I can't leave the school, Germán. You have to come. What did you do? - Who is he? - The regional inspector. - What? - Where were you? Good morning, Germán. Morning. This is Mr. Edelman, from the Regional Inspectorate. - How are you doing? - Fine. How can I help you? Should we talk here? Sure. Mr. Arguello, I'm sorry. We've received reports of school violence committed by the authorities of this school. Particularly by you two. Look, you'll have to excuse me. We have some pressing issues. I have to ask you to wait for me for a while. Could you take this gentleman to the hall? Get him some coffee, water. Whatever you need. Yes, sure. - Come with me, please. - Sonya, let's go outside, please. What did Cata's mom tell you? What did you do, Germán? You've got to help me, Sonya. All you had to do was take her home. I was about to call the police, Germán. Stop, Sonya. Listen to me... No, you listen to me! Shut up! I won't call the police or anyone else. But this is the last time I cover for you. I don't know what you're going to do, but fix this. I won't cover for you again. And now you're going to tell Edelman that everything's fine with me. That I do a good job. And you're going to leave this school. You're going to leave, or I will tell him that last night you were at your place with Cata and a hooker. You thought I didn't know who you were with last night? I don't care if they fire you or if you quit, but you're going to leave this school, Germán. And find Cata. Her mother arrives today. We're starting proceedings against this school. It's possible you two will have to leave for a while. While the case is... Sonya has nothing to do with this. I am the principal here. When the proceedings are ready, we'll see how we organize each... You've no idea what's going on in here. I have 200 students that yell, insult, fuck, smoke, do drugs. Some student fucks up, and who's responsible? I have to take care of it because the family disappears. You wouldn't last a day here. - Listen to me... - No, no. You listen. I've been running this school for eight years, and I will continue to do so. And now I have to ask you to leave. Right now. Hello? Hello? You came looking for me last night. Rubén. You caused all that commotion at the bar looking for me. - Listen to me. - What do you want? There's this girl called Cata. There's a lot near the bar. Do not get out of the car. No, no. Don't get out. Lower it. What are you looking for, exactly? I want to know where Cata is. You came looking for me at the bar last night? You caused a commotion. You told people you wanted to exchange a girl. Which girl? I need to know where Cata is. That's all. What Cata? What Cata? I know Mica is leaving. Where is she going? What are you saying? Get out. Get out now! Get out of the car! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! No. Stop! Come here, you son of a bitch! Cata! Cata! Cata! Cata! Hey. Tell me where Mica is. Where is she? SAN ROQUE CHAPEL Mica. Hello. Hello. Pick up. I know where you live. Hello? Open up! Where is she? Where is she? We didn't go to your place because she didn't want to. Her mother already knows. She's almost here. Cata. Let's go. Get your things and let's go. Cata, can't you understand that if you don't come with me, you'll end up like her? Where were you last night? Where the fuck did you take her last night? Calm down. I understand... You don't understand anything, you whore! Her mother is looking for her and I'm responsible, you idiot! What were you going to do with her? - What do you want? - Enough! What did you want to get me mixed up in? Enough, I said! Stop! What did you want to do? I wanted to leave! I asked her not to tell you anything! She wanted to see a friend. Calm down. What friend? Cata, which friend? What did you do? Cata, what did you do? We only stayed for a little while. What did you do? Why didn't you call me? Why didn't you come back home? Because I was fine like that! Without you. Hello? Yes. Everything's fine here. Yes. She'll be right down. Let's go. You got everything? I might have left some folders. I can bring them by your place. What are you going to do? I don't know. I think I'll get a drink. "Some progressive tendencies promote the vindication of native peoples, raising the heroic flag of Latin America. However, an exhaustive reviewing of our denomination as a region would more in accordance with the emancipating principles of the 21st century. The word America comes from Richard Amerike, the millionaire British entrepreneur that funded the journeys that discovered Canada in 1497. Also, the word Latin comes from the derivation of the languages originating from Latin. Thus, Latin America is, in its most strict linguistic meaning, a colonial baptism. Today more than ever, the scientific community, historians, anthropologists and geographers face the difficult but stimulating task of giving the region a name that is coherent with its own history, which will lead to a real renovation of the emancipating principles of the native peoples."
