Via Appia written and directed by Jochen Hick GENTLEMEN'S HOSTEL WELCOME TO THE AIDS CLUB The joke about the "AIDS Club" wasn't new either. He asked where the boy had copied the slogan. I told him I'd been a flight attendant. He said that a flight attendant infected with AIDS from Rosenheim who takes boys to his room and takes pictures of them ... that wasn't a sufficient reason to publish the pictures in his magazine. ﻿Aren't you ready yet? It's after twelve. Just a moment. You know we can't allow this to every patient. - It the last time for now. - OK. The story about the "promiscuous gay" was well-known fact, he said. He asked if there weren't more photos of this guy from the hostel, so that it would be clear that more had been involved, emotionally too. Should I have told him, "yes, I liked the guy a lot, but unfortunately he sneaked away during the night, he stole my camera and he left a nice farewell note on the bathroom mirror." So he won't buy the photos? Looks like it. Although I told him I'd keep on working on them once I got out of here, that I would fly back there again. Oh well ... there's nothing I can do about it. And that we're making a film about you? That didn't impress him much. In fact, he can fuck off. That's what I imagined. Fortunately, it's quite harmless. The lung lobes weren't as damaged as I assumed. Even so, I won't recommend the trip to Brazil. But if you really want to shorten everything ... I won't hold anyone responsible. Not even you. - When is your flight? - This week. This is name of the hospital in Rio de Janeiro. In case of emergency it'll probably be the best address. I promise you won't see me again soon. Did you get the tickets? ﻿Yes, but I still have to pay the full fee. HAMBURG AIRPORT Maybe it isn't such a good idea to record ??? something here. Don't they all look the same to you? It seems to me he still thinks we're lovers. Who? Dr. Benachani. What an attentive team-player he is. That you're making a film about me, he probably thinks this must be true love. And did you tell him why we're making the film? Supply exceeds demand these days. I'll have to make an effort. LUFTHANSA Look, from the television! Shall we go? You're already economizing on the first day? How are you feeling? Ok. But I'm very tired. I used to go to bed early. How else can you get up at 4 a.m. ﻿But when we landed somewhere, we often had to fly back straightaway. I only had time for the pick-up. Often I just reeled down the aisle, you can imagine what I looked like then. No way near looking like a sun-tanned flight crew member ... Sometimes someone didn't show up on time for the bus and was discovered bound and gagged in his room by a colleague. But some are such idiots ... When did you arrive? I haven't seen your name on the list. A few days ago. Are you flying back on Saturday? I'm on leave. They don't let me work anymore. I have something for you. Lucia is my "base" in Rio. She used to be interested in my love affairs. Acamucho Becerra is a friend of mine. He's a doctor at the University Clinic. I think I can still afford a private clinic. If you want to spend your money within two days ... But I'm entitled to vacation allowance. In Hamburg I always slept through the night. My first lay-over was 6 days in South Yemen. My second Rio. Afterwards I always tried to get to back to Rio. Hello. All good? Why should I run up to everyone and tell him? You too don't live by what some guy tells you in a sauna. Are we allowed to film on the second floor? How are you? - Is everything okay? - Very good. - German? - German. - How is business today? - Excellent. TERMAS MIKONOS "José" - All good. - OK. It used to be dark in here. When all that shit started, they put in lights. This way. And now it's dark again. Is that also for television? What the fuck are you talking about? It's a faggot thing! They think we're making a porno anyway! - Do you speak English? - Yes. What are you doing here? We're doing a film about a photographer. But only a film? Yes, we are playing the photographer. I've seen [you] on TV. What kind of film? Porno film. Nice legs. You need a director? I speak German. - Oh. - Yes. Berlin, München, Copenhagen, Cannes... Düsseldorf. You have no problem filming here? No, it's ok. Are you staying in Rio? Yes. Why does he want to know that? It's his job. What kind of film? Don't show it in Brazil. There is better saunas in Rio where you can film. - I don't know. - But Rio is empty. Hey, wait until carnival. Then here there is many Americans. Then here it's totally full. You need to come in carnival. Rio is dead at night, although nobody believes you when you tell them. Did you meet Mario too in the sauna? No, that wasn't for him. Mario never wanted to be photographed. Especially not wearing my cap. At first we always went to my hotel. I asked Mario where he usually went. Maybe this question annoyed him. Anyway, the hotels in this street only allow male customers. Sometimes someone is found in bed with his throat cut. I only found out about that later. I just lost my camera. You already know the rest. Was is that one? ﻿It you don't tell them about German TV they'll let you film. Are you coming? You can go in alone. I don't feel like it. Ask for no. 23. It has to be the same room. Nothing doing. Not even for money? He didn't say. It probably depends on how much. His boss will be here the day after tomorrow. His card, with the number of the international airport. Do you want to meet him again? - Whom? - Mario. Among 10 million people? Let nobody reproach me for not leaving any children for posterity? Sometimes I think I very often had sex out of boredom. But that's probably nonsense. So? ??? 750 $ minimum fee 32.000. Fuck him with his hostel. I don't want to drop the scene. We'll get it. It says that an American flight attendant was murdered on the Via Appia. Via Appia? That's very far out! Mario believed in all that crap about the colonialists from America and Europe and so on ... He really knew his way around the scene. He knew in which hotels the crews stayed, where they usually went out. Maybe he had specialized in flight personnel. ALASKA We already know those two. Attention, from television! We go with them. - Hello, my friend. - Hello. What are you doing here? How are you? Do you want a Coke? OK that's fine. I would like to make some more photos with you. Now? Now. Where? In the hotel. Only photos? Only photos. How much I get? Enough. Okay. Let's go? Let's go. Shall I to change my clothes? Do you have anything? No. I have not done this before, but I'm very expensive. He's already behaving like a model. I too record that kind of stuff. ??? ﻿- What "luck" is it ??? What kind of luck? What kind of movie? Yes. Si. I'm beginning to wonder how you talked to people on the plane. I managed to explain the way to the WC. Once an acquaintance told me: "You have a nice body and a pretty ass." Ask him what his father does. I was with people, I know that he makes movies. ??? ??? Do you like me? hmm. Only with my girlfriend. Oh come on. It will be more expensive. Ok? Hey? Who is this? What's his name? Mario. Is he a model? Why do you ask? I don't know, maybe I've seen him ... What about Mario? He thinks he knows him. From where? Where do you know him from? He's from here, isn't he? I don't know if Mario is still in Rio, but I'd like to see him again. Don't you have photos of him? Did he steal anything from you? Yes, he did, by the way. ﻿Can I have a shower? Can I have the photo? No. ﻿Where is the photo of Mario? ﻿Do you think the guy in the hostel has noticed that I'm sick? Don't worry, he's just greedy. And José? It would be crazy if I could find Mario. hello? Who's talking? hello? hello. Hello. - All good? How are you? ﻿My photographs are ready? - I don't know. - You said they were ready today. - Come on, you! - Hey! Hey, this car is yours? Si. - Good, very good! Do you remember the guy with big hair? - Yeah. - Si. - Do you remember Mario? - Si. - I know Mario. - Sure? For sure? Yes, I know Mario. It's been more than 6 months, the last time he was in Rio . But since our little friend remembers it so well, maybe he too had a crush on Mario. What did you say about Mario? Hey friend, stop, stop! Just a moment. Giving massages isn't a regular job around here. Why? Do you dislike him? They don't know anything. ??? A CURE AGAINST AIDS HE WAS WAS CURED OF AIDS I don't know, 4 weeks ago it was still open. They too have closed in the meantime. But he didn't work in a sauna anyway. Let's go. Mario used to tell fancy stories. That he was a student and would be flying over to Europe soon. That he even had a job ready for him over there. Can you tell me something about your life? It's very good, my life. Why? I don't know why. We're not going to eat here, are we? No. No thanks. Hey? - It's a good camera, no? - hmm - It's very expensive? - 1.000 $. How many Cruzados? How much is it in Cruzados? You don't have to tell him. Is it American? No, German. - Good. - Do you have cigarettes? - They are Morris. Mexican? - No, Switzerland. Club Uhlenhorst, Hamburg. Where did you get this? Why you seek ??? Mario doesn't work in a sauna? Why shouldn't Mario work in a sauna? You should know best. I saw that guy in the sauna. He wasn't there. We already went and it was closed. They closed the sauna? Not from São Paulo? I think I've seen him in saunas, doing that kind of thing. - I think his name is Georgie... - Mario... He says Mario. He is white and skinny. Pale-faced, like him. A "pale-face"? The guy you're referring to is as pale as me. He looks very dark in the photo. ﻿Nobody should know he's looking for him and why, OK? You don't trust anyone. Why must nobody know? Do you think I want to be known as a walking virus bomb? Farme de Amoedo. Now the beach is called Farme de Amo-Aids. Do you want to have fun, boys? An American was killed here, you know? - Here? - yes? A flight attendant. It is not clear if he was a flight attendant. Somebody told me we could find him here. Are you sure? - Yes. Hello. Are you looking for someone to flirt with? Huh? No? Oh thanks. - Have you ever been to Nova York before? - A few times. An American wanted to take Mario to work in a New York sauna. He had everything ready. He even asked him to get tested. When he had everything ready, the gringo suddenly disappeared. What was that about New York? Some American wanted to take him to the States and let him work in his New York sauna. So he even got tested. But then it didn't happen. Have you never seen him again? ﻿Hey! Tomorrow we shoot in the "Hostel para cavalheiros". In the hostel? Why? It's important for the film. And they let you get in, just like that? It won't work. You'll see. What is this? I don't have nothing. Maybe I have. I know there are sick men out there who don't stop fucking. You don't look like one to me. I like you. You also get tested every 6 months. Who told you that? What was that about 6 months? A German told me. A German told him that all Germans get tested every 6 months. And you are not afraid? No. I'm not homosexual. Nobody fucks me. - Are you the photographer? - Not now! Fuck off! Excuse me, the photo the boy gave me wasn't this one, it's another one. Let's forget about it all. This is for our furniture. You're getting on my nerves. Is he going to buy furniture for his fiancée now? What do you say? Nothing. And what do you think I'm thinking all the time? Don't think I'm stupid. I'm leaving! José has been quite busy. Is all of Rio now running around with the photocopy? GENTLEMEN'S HOSTEL WELCOME TO THE AIDS CLUB I guess this is it. Sometimes I wonder if I should use this film and say a lot of things. Am I not asking enough questions? No, it's ok. MIDDAY ACCOMMODATION FOR GENTLEMEN What's wrong? I called Germany today. What did he boss say? well ... My brain is not yet affected by the virus. You can speak plainly. For him the project is done. He withdrew the final payment. What about the cheque he was going to send? That will take time. But he can't do this to you, we're in the middle of it, he must understand. He said he'd been understanding long enough. He's started a new project about homeless Sinti. He said, if your sickness had really broken out, it would have been different, but being like it is ... He said, thousands are worse off than you, and they don't even have a family. You think the same, only you don't want to admit it. I don't want to record someone's self-destruction. While others die miserably? So you want to drop it too? It has nothing to do with what I want. And when shall it be? Right now? I can't pay the crew anymore. I've talked to them, they might be willing to ... I don't need your charity. I don't need you to find him. You think I'm letting myself go? I haven't said that. Forget it. 5:30. We have to get out of here anyway. - When are you leaving? - Today. The fridge. Can I put it up here? We could have afforded something better. ﻿Don't be so picky. The air conditioning. And the TV. Thank you. You're welcome. ﻿Everything okay? hello. At least Mario had good teeth. Some of these guys here on the Via Appia, they really turn you off. 7 Mark without a condom. Why didn't you take him to Germany? ﻿Are you the flight attendant who's looking for his lover? I don't look like him, but we can flirt. Another one who offers his services. Will those photos also be sold? He didn't prescribe nicotine! Maybe he's already died. Don't you speak Portuguese? - Romantic "love-death", huh? - What are you doing here? - You don't understand anything. - If you don't speak Portuguese... If you want to make me believe that the entire world consists of hustlers, forget it. This here is just an action for the repenting of sins ??? ??? Hey brother, you're that kind of faggot who doesn't agree with me. You're going to spend some time here in Brazil, and you're going to complicate my life. If my family finds out, I'll be screwed. I don't want any of that. Forget it. Do you know the feeling, when life seems to be going clearly in one direction, whereas in fact the opposite happens? Let's stop for today. ﻿Has the midday meal made you sick too? It's not because of that. I know. UNIVERSITY CLINIC Are you sure you don't want to stay in the clinic? I'll go to another one. LOVE DOESN'T KILL So you'll take the next plane? I'll call Lucia tomorrow. ﻿Did you show him the photo of Mario? He doesn't know him. Acamucho only noticed Mario's thick jacket. His clinic is only one of the two which accept these cases. I'll try the medication he gave me. Please, let's stay at the hotel. - Frank? - Hmm? ﻿Shall I attach it or not? It won't take long and then we'll go on, okay? In São Paulo there's a transvestite brothel, la casa das bruxas, the witches' house, the madam has turned it into a sanatorium. ﻿And? We've already shot 8 reels with José. Is it the same hassle for a Brazilian as for an African who wants to go to Germany? ﻿Aids certificate, etc.? I guess so. ﻿Import regulations are getting stricter. How many more bribes do I have to pay? I always knew that making movies wasn't cheap. I'll get him out of there. How do I look? Forget it. TERMAS MIKONOS He no longer works here. Since when? Maybe they fired him, I don't know. Hello, is everything okay? Are you looking for José? José is here next door. They told me you left the hotel. It seems you've really missed me! ??? ﻿You've been on the Via Appia again. Is he spying on us? Or how does he know we went there again? - Guess. - What? - He is here. - Who? Mario. A client gave me this card. Mario works in a sauna in São Paulo. Mario works in this sauna. ﻿Did a client from São Paulo tell him? So where do I work? - How much does that camera cost? - 20.000. - How many cruzados is that? - I don't know. It's my birthday today. To our film! Cheer up! ﻿Perhaps we'd better congratulate him. Why? Did he ... Hey! José! Then let's go. Five men? No. I knew it. What a shame, by God. They only admit men with women. Did you manage to record it? No more dirty stuff, only bourgeois heteros ... I get it. ﻿Everything is in the camera. I'm sorry, I would have invited you. Hello, everything okay? 3000? 3000 cruzados. Almost the same as in the big city. What's the best you have? Suite No. 1. ﻿5 bottles of wine for suite no. 1. Thank you. The Little International Family on Vacation. Here you are. Thank you. Come on! Come up! Come up! CENTAURO MOTEL Is that you? Shooter? Sagittarius? What's this? Vitamins. For sexual potency. And against... Against the disease? Hey, you're sick? The Japanese have already discovered a remedy against it. I should have realized earlier. Sometimes you're kind of weird, aren't you? So? He's always suspected it about me. Because I'm so weird ... And that the Japanese invented an AIDS remedy. What are you going to film now? What kind of film are we doing anyway? It's about me. About you? And your lover pays the film? I'm not the lover. Mario... Excuse me, excuse me. You left your boyfriend in Germany. Of course I left my boyfriend in Germany. So what are you doing here now? You'll have to tell him now what you're doing here. The Brazilians make better sex. He have a good look. What are you going to do when you find Mario? Hey! ﻿To buy my ticket to Europe. What are you laughing at? - What is that? - Anastacia. No, no, no. Don't touch it. Anastacia was a special slave. Because her parents was rich persons in Africa. And she never accepted to be poor ​​and died for this. ok? Something about your family. My family comes from São Paulo, did you know? - Not from Rio? - No, no, not from Rio. And your father, what is he doing? Do I have to compete with his personal story as well? Why do you have to take Mario to Germany? You have been to São Paulo before? 5 or 6 times. with my ... There I come from. there. Yes, stop there, stop there. Are you finished? I think it's really too much. You don't charge in Brazil, it is only for German tourists. ﻿Pay him, we'll only stay an hour anyway. - Are you from German television? - Yes. $500. 500. $500. It's cheap. - You'll like it. - 200 $. No, 500 $. - Are you from Hamburg? - Yes. I'll show you a souvenir I got from Hamburg. You'll like it. - Do you know this sauna? - It's a sauna in Hamburg. That place has been closed for 4 years. CLUB UHLENHORST We already talked and the only Mario here is me. There is no other Mario. What did he say? Nobody knows him here, or they're lying again. Good tip! A math book. - Are you the only Mario here? - Yes. Come with me, please. - Do you know Mario? - What if I meet Mario? Here everyone is healthy. ﻿Has anybody said that someone here is sick? Actually it's silly to pick one person to stand out from all the rest. One doesn't have to imitate the heteros in everything. Ready to go? ﻿There's more action at the Rosenheim train station. Sorry, normally homosexuals are famous for their sense of humour. - Good night. - Hey, citizen. - Documents, please. - Documents? - What are you doing here in the square? - Ok. What are they doing here in the square? Are they recording everything? ﻿Turn that off. They are recording everything. - We're doing ... - Is everyone here with you? Do you still know where the car is? Hey, you have ... ? All gringos have money. Damn it, tell him I'm not a gringo. But you look very American. He knows best what an American looks like. The man in Rio told me that Mario is here. You don't believe? Let him go, for God's sake. This is the most profitable ??? hitchhike of his life. You could park the car in the meantime. Good morning. Good morning. Where were you? I called Lucia. She's giving a party tonight. She's invited us. That's fitting. What's fitting? With our departure. She's also got tickets for the plane tomorrow. Only two, the others can follow later. Did I ask you to do it? What do you mean, just the two of us? Are you out of your mind! Instead of the cheque, the return ticket. What a professional you are! This room smells. ﻿Sure, since you turned off the fan. What the hell is this? I thought your fasting cure was over. I want to reduce to 40 kilos. Fuck your fatherly concern! Your drama is that you have fucked men, and mine, that I won't be able to anymore. ﻿- It couldn't be more banal. - That's enough. If you go out now looking like that, they're going to smash your face. Don't count on me in that case! Has the protagonist become invisible? He's getting worse. Why aren't you with him? You two have a thing, if I'm not mistaken. What's up? ﻿Everything okay? Glad to hear it. hello. hello. - A friend of a friend? It used to be like that, yes. Is it for the first or second channel? Second. [ZDF] ﻿Lucía told me that ??? - Oh yes? - Yeah. Where is he? Back to Germany? No, he is in the hotel. What a pity! Which hotel? -I think he's a bit younger than you. - What? How long do you already stay here in Rio? 4 weeks. 4 weeks? Summer, sun, beach! We fucked up ??? for 4 weeks. What? Excuse me. Let's go! ﻿Should we shoot the last roll on the beach? No, let's go back to the hotel. Shit... shit ... TERMAS MIKONOS Nothing here. Get in. One way, baby! Is "loiro" a German? What does "loiro" mean? Blonde, I think. He's ... he's Brazilian. Watch out! Fucking car! Check it out! Whore! Faggot! ﻿Faggot! Get out of here, faggot! How was Lucia's party? We've already been to the hotel. Your material never runs out! Lucía asked about you. She could have come too if she'd wanted to. Did she again wonder whom I'm dating now. ﻿Can't we shoot on the beach? Hey. I never come here. Copacabana is a hit beach ??? Only for tourists. Believe me, it's out. You should be very careful, especially in this time. They've murdered and robbed an American couple. Just yesterday night. Are your tits real? Tell him to wrap them up again. What are you going to do now? I don't know. I really don't know. There is no more film stock left. Engl. subtitles: serdar202@KG 2023
