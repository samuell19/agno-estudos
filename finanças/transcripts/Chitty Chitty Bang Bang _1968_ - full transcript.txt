Hang on, we're coming to a bend. You're going too fast. No, I'm not. Hang on. What's this heap of old iron doing here? Old iron? I'll give you 10 bob for it. Don't be daft. This was once a great car. Won the Grand Prix three years running. So it's a car, is it? Certainly it's a car. It's a racing car. And we're winning. And you're in the way. And you're in the way for a right belt around the ear, young man, if I have any more of your lip. All right. I'll give you 15 bob for it. Make it 30 bob, and she's yours. Mr Coggins, you're not going to sell her, are you? Of course he's gonna sell her. What do you think he's running here, a children's playground or something? All right, 30 bob. I'll pick her up Wednesday. But, Mr Coggins, you promised we could play in her. Well, I'm sorry, my dears, but she ain't any use to me. Times are hard. But you can't take her away. She's not just any old car. She's ours. Not any more, she ain't. I'll see you tomorrow, Bill. Giddy-up. What're you going to do with her? I'll tell you what we're gonna do with her, we're gonna put her in the clapper and we're gonna crunch her up till she's one solid piece of metal. Then we're gonna put her in a fiery furnace, and we're gonna melt her down till she's liquid iron. That's what we're gonna do with her. Now look what you've done. You've frightened her. She shivered. See? She's a very special car. If you put her in the fiery furnace, you'll be guilty of murder. Yeah, and if you don't get out of it, I'll be guilty of two more murders. Now go on, out of it. Giddy-up. Giddy-up. Please, Mr Coggins, you can't sell our lovely car to that nasty man. Well, I'm sorry, children, but I'm afraid I already have. I know. Daddy will buy it for us. Won't he, Jemima? Of course he will. Mr Coggins, promise you won't let her go until we come back. Well, 30 shillings, mind. Not a penny less. Please promise. Please. All right, I promise. Come on, Jemima. Well, that's a clever thing to do. We're very sorry, Miss. I'm sure you are. Well, just look at my car. And just look what a mess I'm in, too. Oh, no, I think you're beautiful. And I like your car. Just the same, you shouldn't be rushing across the road like that. You know, you might have been killed. Anyway, why aren't you in school? It isn't a holiday, is it? No, Miss. Do you live around here? Yes, we live just down the road. Come on, get into my car, I'm taking you home. Gosh, just wait till Daddy hears we've been for a ride in a motorcar. Yes. What's your name? I'm Jemima. And I'm Jeremy. - What's yours? - Truly. That's a very pretty name. Now, where is your house? Oh, we don't live in a house. We live in the castle on top of the hill. A castle? I didn't know there were any castles around here. Well, it isn't a castle exactly. That's what Daddy calls it. He says King Alfred used to live there hundreds of years ago. And does your daddy know you aren't in school? Oh, he won't mind. He never does. Anyway, he's awfully busy. Is he? Well, he'll have to find time to see me, because I have a few things to say to him. Edison. Edison. Come here, boy. Good boy, good boy. That's Daddy over there. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. You're just in time. What on earth is he up to? That's his latest invention. Rockets. Rockets? Stand back. Keep clear. Does he know what he's doing? Of course he does. Well, I don't see anything funny. Somebody should do something about it. Hold on. Hold on. Wait. Wait there. Thank you. I should hope so. You might have gone up in flames. Madam, I took that into consideration. This suit is completely flameproof. Oh, dear. You have just succeeded in ruining my propulsion unit. But how was I to know that you were... Don't be cross with the lady, Daddy. She gave us a ride in her car. She was only trying to help. How very kind. - Her name's Truly. - That's nice. Do you realise, Mr Potts, that I nearly knocked down your two children? Well, we do seem to be accident-prone, don't we? But it wasn't my fault. You see, they came rushing out... Oh, well, it was very, very nice of you to apologise. - Apologise? - Tea time, children. Bye-bye, Truly. Thanks for the ride. Just a moment, you two. Don't you have something to tell your father? Yes, we have. Daddy, Mr Coggins promised us... But she didn't mean about that. Daddy, we didn't go to school today. Well, it'll give the other children a chance to catch up, won't it? Run along, children. - Goodbye. Goodbye. - Bye, Truly. Come on, Edison. - But, Mr Potts... - Good day. - But, but... - Unstable. Definitely unstable. Good afternoon, Miss. Sorry I can't stop. I'm off to India. Going to have a cup of tea with the Maharajah. Cheerio. Mr Potts. I'm sorry to persist about this, but perhaps you simply aren't aware that your children were running about in the road. And after all, you know, it's not a playground. It's very... Would you mind just pressing that switch there? - Switch? - Yes, just behind you. On the right. The right. The right? Thank you. You really ought to try and exercise more control over them. Yes, I suppose I could chain them up, couldn't I? On a nice long chain, of course, so they get plenty of exercise. Mr Potts, don't your children go to school? Oh, I have it now. You're the truant officer. No, I'm not the truant officer. Well, didn't you ever play truant? I mean, just once? No, I most certainly did not. I bet you didn't. Would it be too much to ask what this is, this, thing? A little invention of mine, cleans carpets by suction. All that to clean carpets? Away with sweeping, and away with brushing, and away with dirty carpets. Is that all you do, Mr Potts? Invent things? Is that all I do? And what's this gadget? Well, that's not quite right yet, but eventually, I hope to transmit moving pictures by wireless. - Oh, really? - Yes, really. That's my... And this? This, madam, is a sweet-making machine. And is this one of the sweets? Yes, it is. And is it supposed to have all those holes in it? No. Actually, I think that the problem is... The boiling point of your sugar is too high. Oh, we're an expert on sweet-making, are we? Well, as a matter of fact... And an expert on child welfare. I was only trying to help your children. Well, maybe my children like running wild in the street. - Did that ever occur to you? - I do not see any cause to... And in any case, how my children behave is frankly no concern of yours. I was merely trying... So, if you'll be so good as to take yourself off in that fancy automobile of yours and go do good somewhere else. Well, I've never been... Spoken to that way before? Well, maybe it's about time. Good afternoon, madam. Mind the cable. Vicious, interfering... if women are going to drive motorcars around, they should learn to operate one correctly. Well, I suppose it wouldn't occur to you to offer to help me. Get in the car. Please. Well, for a mechanically-minded man, Mr Potts... Try switching it on. Open the throttle. And keep it open. Women. Confounded woman. Who does she think she is? Coming in here and telling me how to raise my children. Do I need somebody to tell me how to raise my children? Do I? No, of course not. Of course not. Where's my cardigan? Under your jacket. - Under... - Yes. Self-righteous busybody. She won't be bothering us again. But I liked her. So did I. She was very pretty. She certainly was. Do you think your father's a crackpot? Your cardigan's inside out. Do you think I'm a lunatic, wasting my time on a lot of silly inventions? But they aren't silly. They're wonderful. Nobody else could think of them. That's right. That is right. Nobody else could think of them. Yes. After all, what makes the battle worth the fighting? What makes the mountain worth the climb?

Do I smell food? Bring the bread, will you, Grandpa. Yes, sir. Sir. Sir. And pepper and salt, please. Right away, sir. Sausage and egg, my favourite. - How was India? - India? I'll tell you something. I got up this morning, and I shot an elephant in my pyjamas. How he ever... Got into my pyjamas, I shall never know. You've heard it before. Now, I wonder how that could have happened. Daddy, could we ask you something? It's about Mr Coggins. Mr Coggins. You see, the junkman wanted to take it away. But Mr Coggins says if we asked you first... Asked me what first? He's a horrid, mean, old man. Mr Coggins? No, the junkman. He's going to take it away and put it in a furnace. And burn it all up. It's terrible. What are you going on about? Our car. Yes, well, what about it? Mr Coggins is selling it to the junkman. And the junkman's going to put it in the fiery furnace. And squidge it all up till there's nothing left. Oh, well, that's terrible. That is terrible. We can't let that happen, Grandpa. No, definitely not. We knew you wouldn't let them, Daddy. So we made Mr Coggins promise we could have it if you gave him 30 shillings. 30 shillings. You can give Mr Coggins the money in the morning, Daddy. Yes, well, I suppose we can work something out somehow. Good. Hooray. Are you all finished? - Yes, Daddy. - Yes, thank you. Well, I think, maybe, you should go run up to bed. - Good night, Grandpa. - Good night, my boy. Sleep tight. Good night, Grandpa. Good night, my darling. God bless you. - Good night, Daddy. - Good night. Good night, Daddy. Yes, well, you've done it now, haven't you? You think Coggins might do a deal? So much a week? Coggins? What, him down the road? Sure. He's so mean he wouldn't light your pipe if his house was on fire. Did you hear that? You know what that means, don't you? I'll be up all night, rain pouring through my bedroom roof. Grandpa, why don't you sleep in the workshop? It's nice and... The workshop? You promised, faithfully, to fix my bedroom roof. I will, Grandpa. It's just... Caractacus, please. My boy, listen. It's time you woke up. When I was your age, I did a day's work... For a day's pay, polishing the Colonel's boots. I was the smartest batman in the British Army. So you've been telling me. When my Brigadier went into action, the fuzzy-wuzzies were so blinded by the shine on his boots, they couldn't see to fight. Catch me death of cold. He doesn't care. Nobody cares. Me own son. She was right. Who wants sweets with holes in them? Oh, Edison, stop that whistling. Edison, hey, do that again. Edison, you're a genius. The employment office is in the rear. Thank you. Oh. You see, I've invented these sweets. Really? Name? Whistling Sweets. Mr Whistling Sweets. Not Mr Whistling Sweets. No, I'm Potts. May I see the managing director? Lord Scrumptious sees no one without an appointment. Well, how do I get an appointment? Why, hello, children. Jeremy, it's Truly. Hello, Truly. Good morning, Miss Scrumptious. How nice to see you. Good morning, Phillips. Please tell my father that I'm here. But of course, Miss Scrumptious. Are you here on business, Mr Potts? Yes, Miss... Father? Truly Scrumptious. You're his... His daughter. Come on, children, let's go. But, Daddy, you haven't shown anybody your invention. Somehow, I don't think that'll do much good. Just a moment, Mr Potts. Exactly what was it you... You've seen them. Oh, those. But they whistle. Whistle? Those holes. You just blow through them. They're very ingenious. Kind of a novelty. Please go in, Miss Scrumptious. You can come back in three weeks' time. Show Mr Potts in, Phillips. - Now? - Now. - But his Lordship said... - Now. Very well. Please follow me. Maybe I should come back in three weeks. Oh, Daddy. Go on, Daddy. All right. And don't let him bully you. Yes. Mr Potts, milord. Potts? Who's he? Where's me daughter? She insisted on Mr Potts seeing you. All right, don't just stand there. What's it all about? Sweets, sir. I hardly thought it was nuts and bolts. Let's have a look. Yes. - Hurry up, man. - Yes, sir. If I may be allowed to explain, sir. You have exactly 20 seconds. Yes. Well, the fundamental novelty of these particular sweets is their musical quality. Not only are they remarkably tasty, but due to the unique positioning of these little holes, they are capable, when blown through, of rendering a tuneful whistle. Place your fingers over the holes and blow thus. Tasting time, milord. Too late. Had your chance. Muffed it. Good morning. Go on. Follow him. Milord? Sir? Excuse me. Sir, if I may be allowed to demonstrate. You see, by blowing air through this hole in the centre of the sweet you get a wonderful-sounding... - Raspberry? - No, no. It's more like a toot, really. Not enough fruit, too much sugar. - Yes, milord. - Prepare the peppermint. Beautiful. Would you care to try it, sir? Under no circumstances. Prepare the lemon. He's not doing very well, is he? You know, another remarkable feature about these little sweets - is that by sucking on them... - Throw it away. Will you get rid of this idiot for me? Milord. You... in perfect pitch. They also come in strawberry, raspberry... - Are you still here? - Lemon and... And pineapple. Go on. Don't waste your pucker on some all-day sucker. And don't try a toffee or cream.

Now, why aren't you two asleep? Don't be sad, Daddy. It wasn't your fault. It was all those mean, old dogs. Children, about the car... You see, 30 shillings is pretty hard to come by. And when I do get any money, I need it for my inventions. Well, there isn't any left. Jeremy and I have been thinking. It's our treasure chest. These things are enormously valuable. Look, an ivory tusk. That must be worth a fortune. And diamonds. And a golden crown. It's probably King Alfred's. Of course, it needs cleaning up a little. Take them, Daddy. You can sell them. And never mind about the car. You can spend it all on your inventions. Thank you, children. All these wonderful things, they're very precious. But I'm afraid other people wouldn't appreciate them. Why not, Daddy? Because other people don't see things the way you do. Come on, now. Let's go to bed. And don't you worry.

I do not profess to make dead men talk. Hey, now, here you go then. Who's for an automatic haircut? Only three pence a time. You may have long hair, you may have short hair, sir, you may have straight hair, it makes no difference to the Potts automatic and hygienic, electronic hair-cutting machine. Come on.

Well, it needs a little work, but there's a fine engine under here. It doesn't go, though, does it? No, not yet, but it will. It will. You can make it go, can't you, Daddy? Well, I'm gonna give it a try. All right, come on, everybody, put a hand to the wheel. George, give us a hand, will you? - Yes, sir. - Okay, heave. We're off. We're off. Hooray. Comfortable, Grandpa? Won't work, of course. Another catastrophe. - Left hand down. - Come on, Grandpa, push. Watch it, Jeremy. Mind the bicycle. Push. Good. Keep coming, Jeremy. That's it. Keep coming. Look out, Edison.

No, come on, my dears, we'd better go. You know what your dad's like when he's working. But, Grandpa, we wanted to stay and watch. Come back in the house, darling. I'll make you a nice cup of tea. Don't overdo it, will you, my boy? Right, Grandpa. You might exhaust yourself. Come on. "And the big brown bear "came lolloping over the mountain. "'No, no, ' the princess cried. "And the big brown bear came lolloping over the mountain." it's awfully quiet in there. Come on, children, breakfast is ready. He's been there for days. Will you please come and have your breakfast? But Daddy said the car would be finished today. Darling, you'll be waiting a month of Sundays before he's finished that. Come on. Be good children. Come on. That's Daddy. The car. He's finished the car. Gosh. Well, what do you think of her? She's the most beautiful thing I ever saw in my life. It's wonderful. Oh, Daddy, you're so clever. Oh, yes. Can we go for a drive? - For a drive? - A drive. A drive. I have a better idea. How about a picnic? Hooray. A picnic. A picnic. All right? Let's get cracking. You get the basket out of the workshop. - Get in, Jemima. - Hooray. Hooray. Hurry. Mind the woodwork. Mind the woodwork. Don't touch. Don't touch the horn. Here's the basket, Daddy. Oh, yes, just put it on the back. All right. Now. Don't touch that. Grandfather. Come on. We're going on a picnic. Get aboard, Grandpa. Come on, come on. It'll never go, my dears. Not if he's had anything to do with it. But it is going. Then it'll never stop. Anyway, it's far too hot. Where are you going? Me? I'm off to Alaska, me boy.

Mr Potts. Somebody call? Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. That's all right. What are you doing? Oh, just tinkering. You know, Mr Potts, you have two wonderful children. Why, thank you. I must agree with you there. Isn't it beautiful? Lovely. Just lovely. Jeremy, it's not nice to peek. I'm not peeking, I'm looking. Do you think they like each other? Of course they do. Do you think they're going to get married? Has he kissed her yet? Not yet. Well, just as soon as he kisses her then they'll have to get married. Jeremy, what are you doing? I'm keeping a lookout for pirates. There aren't any pirates around here, are there, Truly? Oh, I'm sure there are. Hundreds of them. Course there are. This is where they bury their treasure, isn't it, Daddy? Tell us a story about pirates, Daddy. A story about pirates, huh? Well, let me see. A boat. I can see a boat. A boat? Did you say, "a boat"? That isn't just any old boat out there. No? No? No. That is a private yacht of the notorious Baron Bomburst. - Baron Bomburst? - Baron Bomburst? You have never heard of Baron Bomburst, ruler of Vulgaria? The most evil man in the world. Oh. Yeah. And he has sailed all the way to England because he has heard tell of a fantastic motorcar built by that brilliant inventor Caractacus Potts. Yes, hooray. And he has come to steal the car and take it back to Vulgaria with him. - No. - Yeah. Yes. That car. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I want it. I want it. I want it. I want it. But, Your Excellency... Are you giving me an argument? No, Your Excellency. Stand by the boats. Stand by the boats. Man the grappling hooks. Man the grappling hooks. And load the cannon. Load the cannon. He's awful. He's terrible. Not only that, he isn't even nice. But he can't steal our lovely car. You won't let him, will you, Daddy? Look. They're getting closer. We've got to get away. Start the car. Quickly, Daddy, before they get here. Well, now, that's easier said than done. - But why, Daddy? - Why? Well, I'll tell you. What none of us have noticed is while we've been sitting here, the tide has been coming in. Now, we're completely cut off. What are we going to do? Do hurry, Mr Potts. Now don't panic. - Everyone, stay calm. - Quickly, Daddy. Quickly. Hurry up. Look. They are completely cut off by the tide. They will all drown. I haven't seen a good drowning in years. Is there anything I can do to help? The throttle. Push the throttle lever. Hurry, Daddy. Hurry. Quickly, Daddy, before they get here. No, not that one, the other one. It's no good. It won't start. We're gonna have to swim for it. Come on, Jemima. We must. Come on. Come on, Jeremy. We have to. Come on, everybody over the side. Quickly. It's starting to change. Everybody, hold on. It's unbelievable. Mr Potts, it's so clever. This is impossible. But you built it. It's a magic car. You always said it was a magic car. - I did? - Yes. Look, it's like a boat. I knew Chitty would save us. Hang on, everybody. We're off. A floating car? What do you think of that, Chancellor? Yeah, Baron. A car floating, floating on the water. This, in my whole life long, it never could be seen, never, never. It's uncategorical. A fuel-burning oracle.

In a few moments we will be landing in Vulgaria. - Where? - Vulgaria. Oh. - So, please, fasten your seat belts. And no smoking. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Speed, four and a half knots, sir. Wind, east-southeast, sir. Brigade, attention. Present arms. We have a guest. Welcome him. Jawohl, your Excellency. Order arms. Ah, Professor Potts. Please, to walk this way. Present arms. On behalf of Her Majesty The Queen, I'd like... Oi. Excuse me. You're early. Down the table and in the pocket. Cheat, cheat, cheat. Ah, Professor Potts. Professor? Vulgaria welcomes the brilliant Professor Potts, inventor extraordinaire. Excuse me, sir. There seems to be some sort of mistake. What? You are not Professor Potts, the inventor? Well, I... Executioner. Executioner. What would you like me to invent, sir? I will show you. My horse. Get the horse for his Excellency. Giddy-up. How proud you look on that fine horse. The most beautiful toy you ever bought me, my darling. But who is this? This is Professor Potts from England. How do you do, madam? And I think we have a surprise for you. Herr Professor, come on. Well, what do you think, professor? Everything you need. And these will be your assistants. And here, this is the Baronial car. Can you make this car float? Float? Like amphibial English moty car, float over the cresty wave of the water. Yes, sir, but you see, it's not that easy without my laboratory. Oh, I have already thought of that. Here is your lavatory. If you succeed in making the car float, I will make you privy councillor. But if you fail, I will stuff your head with sauerkraut and feed you to the dogs. Feedy dorribles, snarly horribold. You have got 24 hours. Twenty-four hours and worky nosy grindstone. Proper card he is. Odd sense of humour. Stuff me head with sauerkraut. The Baron never makes jokes. Look at us. We've been here for years and years. I came here to repair the telephone. That was 24 years ago. They have terrible tortures. The thumbscrew and rack. They stretch you and stretch you. When I first came here, I was a midget. Come on. Me? Floating car? Well, that's impossible. Nothing's impossible. Now, that's what my son's always saying. We'll help you, won't we, lads?

Now, hang on, everybody. We're coming in to land. Your Excellency, it's landing in the village. In the village. Call out the guards. Everybody, charge. And call out the child catcher. Charge. Charge. Charge. Let me in. Hooray. We've landed. Hooray. We've landed. Hooray. Hooray. Isn't Chitty wonderful? Aren't you clever, Daddy? Yes, he certainly is. All right. You all stay here. I'm going up to that castle. We want to come, too. We want to help you find Grandpa. Don't you think we ought to stay together? Maybe you're right. All right, come along. Come on, children. I wonder where we are. I don't know. Come on. Pardon me, sir. The castle? What's the matter with him? Come on. What are they staring at? I don't know. It seems to be the children. What's the matter with them? Haven't they seen children before? Haven't you noticed? There aren't any children. Not one. What's going on? What's happening? What's... Hey, you. What's happening? What's going on? - What is it? - Soldiers. Soldiers. Hey, you there. Get those children in here. Would you mind telling me what's happening? Quickly, before the soldiers get here. - Soldiers? - Come, Fräulein. Quickly, quickly. Get inside. Just a minute. Would somebody - mind telling me what's going on? - Please don't talk. We must get those children out of sight. Jeremy. If the soldiers find them, they will take them away. But why? What for? It's the law. Nobody's allowed to have children in Vulgaria. Not allowed? What about these toys? The Baroness, she hates children. Who could hate children? Quickly, down there. Whatever you do, don't make a sound. I want every house in this square to be searched from top to bottom. Jawohl, Captain. The first section, step out over there and search. The second section, over there and search. Quick. Section three, over there. Quick. Search. Search everywhere. Giddy-up. Giddy-up. There are children here somewhere. I can smell them. Captain, I think we've got them. Lieutenant. You two men, break down this door. - Quick. Quick. - Yes, sir. Get this door open. Quickly. All right. I'm coming. I'm coming. Open the door. Break the door down. Quickly. You have no right to come into here. You've no right. Search the place. Search. Search. They are here somewhere. I can feel it in my bones. There are children here somewhere. Children? In the toy shop? Such a notion. I mean... What do you think you're doing? That's something special for the Baron's birthday. Let me tell you, toymaker. This nose of mine has never failed me, and if there are children here, my friend, you will die. Quick. Open it up. Get down there and search the cellar. The Baroness will have your teeth for a necklace and your eyeballs for earrings. Nobody down here, sir. Fool. Idiot. Out of my way. You have to know where to look. Like cockroaches, they get under the floors, in the cracks in the walls, in the woodwork. I don't trust a man who makes toys in a land where children are forbidden. Every toy I make is exclusively for his Excellency, the Baron. Captain, Captain, the flying car. We've captured the flying car. Come on. Let's go. Take this car to the castle. They can't take Chitty, Daddy. Daddy, do something. They can't take Chitty away. What are you going to do? Well, I don't know, but I'm not just gonna stand here. Are you mad? Are you going to take on the whole Vulgarian Army single-handed? What kind of a country is this? No children. Everybody terrified out of their lives. My friend, take some good advice. Take your children and your good lady and get out of Vulgaria. And leave Grandpa up in the castle? Oh, no. We came to get him out, that's what we're gonna do. Just tell me how to get there. Look, I'm only a toymaker. And if I don't finish this in time for the Baron's birthday tomorrow, I shall be a dead toymaker. All right. I'll go myself. Truly, you stay here with the children. All right. All right. You don't know what you're letting yourself in for, believe me. - Here's one for you, one for you. - Thank you. Thank you, toymaker. Keep them out of sight, please. You be good children. And you do what Truly tells you. Yes, Daddy. We will. Well, are you coming? Come. Quickly, quickly, quickly. There isn't a scrap of food in the place. I'm so hungry, my tummy hurts. Mine's making funny noises. I simply must find something for you. Now, if you promise me not to move from here until I come back... - We promise, don't we, Jemima? - Yes. Now, you remember, you stay right here. To get in that way, you would have to be a mouse or a magician. We should go down now before a sentry sees us. Come. Come. Ah, the flying car. At last it's mine. Send for the inventor. Then, fly. Fly. Yes, fly. Come on, fly. Fly, fly, fly. Oh. I command you to fly. - Bring him over here. - Over here. Hello. What's this doing here? You're the inventor. Make this car fly. - Make it fly. - Go get in. Stand back, everyone. We are going to fly. Stand back. Yoo-hoo, Bombie. Wait for me. No, every time I want to have a little fun, she turns up. There you are. Get in. My darling, we're going for a fly. How exciting. Fly. How thrilling. Very well. Come on. Hurry up. Yes, yes, I'm doing my best, sir. Now just a minute. Here's one that we haven't tried yet. Here we go, my beloved. Hold on. Isn't it exciting, my dear? You're a genius. My guns. Bring my guns. Don't worry. I'll get you down. I've been waiting for this for 20 years. Hold on, my love. Are you still there, my love? Don't move. There she is, Your Excellency. Oh. Oh. My God. My diamonds. Are you all right, my dear? I'm all right, my dumpling. Good. Never mind. I'll get her the next time. Here we are, children. Come and get your lollipops. Lollipops. Come along, my little ones. Lollipops. Ice cream, chocolate, all free today. Listen. Come along, children. Lollipops. What's that? Children, where are you? I know you're here somewhere. I've lots of lovely goodies for you. Jeremy, you mustn't. Lollipops. And all free today. Cherry pies. Cream puffs. Ice cream. Treacle tarts. Treacle tarts. And ice creams. And all free. Come along, kiddie-winkies. Come on. But, Jeremy, Truly said we mustn't... We'll get Truly some as well. Come on. Mr Man. Hey. Wait. Children. Come back here. Wait. Wait. Come along, my little dears, my little mice. Come to me. What will it be? Ice cream? Yes, ice cream. Strawberry, chocolate, vanilla? Strawberry. Chocolate. It's all inside. Yes, strawberry. Come along, my little dears. Goodie. Come on. Yes. Come inside. Not a penny to pay. Yes, come on. Get in. Go inside, my little dears. No. Help, help. Help. Help. Help. Children. Children. Truly. Help. Help. Help. Help. What is it? What's happened? The children. He took the children. Your Excellency. Let us out. Let us out. Silence. Children, Your Highness. Foreign children. Unique specimens. You're sure they can't get out? No, Your Highness. Perhaps Your Highness would care to examine them. Nasty little creatures. Very, very treacherous. Foreign. Just you wait till our daddy hears about this. He'll come and blow up the whole castle. Take them away to the tower. To the tower. Nasty, horrid, mean old lady. And very ugly. Oh, she's going. She's going. Two hundred feet above us through that solid rock is the castle of Baron Bomburst. These are our children. For 12 years, we have hidden them here. Look at them. They don't know what a tree looks like or what it is to run or to laugh in the sunshine. Do you? Food. Get the food here. Come on. There's bread for everyone. Look at them. Like little rats, they run up and down the sewers, stealing food from the kitchens. Potatoes. Here, catch. Son. Son. I'm looking for my children. I think they're up there in the castle with their grandfather. Have you seen anything of them? No, sir. A little boy and girl? Yes. They're locked up in the tower. And the grandfather? He's in the dungeon under the castle. Sir, have you come to help us? Are you going to take us out of here? What's your name, son? Peter, sir. Well, Peter, you shouldn't be afraid, even in a terrible place like this, because there's always hope. That's what I always tell my children when they're afraid. ♪ A gentle breeze ♪ ♪ From Hushabye Mountain ♪ ♪ Softly blows o'er Lullaby Bay ♪ ♪ It fills the sails of boats that are waiting ♪ ♪ Waiting to sail ♪ ♪ So close your eyes ♪ ♪ On Hushabye Mountain ♪ ♪ Wave goodbye ♪ ♪ To cares of the day ♪ ♪ And watch your boat ♪ ♪ From Hushabye Mountain ♪ ♪ Sail far away ♪ ♪ From Lullaby Bay ♪ Is that the only advice you have to offer, my friend?

You look down that way. I'll go this way. Jeremy. Jemima. Jeremy and Jemima. Jeremy. Jemima. It's Truly. Truly. We're in here. Don't worry. We'll get you out of here in a minute. Here. Here, quick. Quick, they're in there. Children, are you all right? Get us out of here. We found them. They're in there. Come on. Help me break the door down. Children, get away from the door. - Children. - Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Let me down. My Liebchen, are you hurt? My back is broken. We must escape through the cellars. Very well. Come on. Come on. Daddy, look at the children. You stay here. Daddy. What are you doing? Where are all these children coming from? I thought we had passed a law against children. Quick. This way. Where are we going? Quickly. We'll go down here. No, no. I'll get my clothes dirty. Don't argue. Oh, my crown. I lost my crown. Oh, never mind, my little pumpkin. Here. Attack. No. Daddy. Look. There's Chitty. Chitty's come to save us. Hooray. Hello, a motorcar. What's that doing here? There's Grandpa. Grandpa. Caractacus. My boy. Are you all right? Stand back from the propellers. Keep clear. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. And so, after that, Vulgaria became a free country, and all the children laughed and played in the sunshine, and they were very, very happy. And Chitty flew high over the mountains back to England, everybody safe and sound. And Daddy and Truly were married. And lived happily ever after. Yes. Is that how the story ends? It's getting late. We better get back. Well... Goodbye, Jeremy. Goodbye, Jemima. Goodbye, Truly. Will we see you again? Oh, I expect so. Goodbye. Goodbye. Truly. I'm sorry about the children. I hope they didn't embarrass you. In what way? Why, that silly joke about us getting married. Well, you know what kids are like. Yes, I understand. I mean, I don't think they realise how ridiculous that would be. Ridiculous? Well, yes. You live in that big house, your father, the factory and all. It's a different world, Truly. You know, if I said something like that, you'd call me a snob. - I didn't mean... - Goodbye. Well, don't you want to ride up front? Well, that was a fine picnic, wasn't it? Shall we have another one tomorrow? With Truly? Yes. Well, Miss Scrumptious has a lot of social engagements, you know. Are we ever going to see Truly again, Daddy? Well, we'll see. Look, that's Lord Scrumptious' car. Why, I believe it is. I wonder what it's doing here. Well, I don't know. Come on. Excuse me. Good afternoon. Are you... Boom. Boom. Boom. That's wiped out your dashed cavalry. Yes, sir. But I have my 2nd Infantry battalion attacking here from the rear. Attacking from the rear? That's dashed unethical. Artillery, prepare to open fire. Fire. Number one battalion, prepare to advance. What's going on here? There you are, young Potts. Been waiting for you. And that wiped out your artillery. You're a cad, Potts. Would someone mind telling me what's going on? Fancy you being old Bungie's son. Bungie? Bungie Potts, best batman I ever had. - Weren't you, Potts? - Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. - You mean that you were... - My boy. Allow me to introduce to you my Brigadier. - Your Brigadier? - Potts... - How about some more tea? - Yes, sir. Right away, sir. As for you, young man, there's a very good chance you may be very rich. Very rich? What do you mean? Those confounded sweets of yours. Useless for humans, wonderful for dogs. Woof Sweets, that's what we'll call them. Woof Sweets? Canine candies. Dogs love them. Make a fortune. Daddy, Daddy. You've done it, Daddy. - You've done it. - Have I? It's the posh life for us all now, my boy. We're all going to be rich. Hooray. Do you mean to tell me I invented something that actually works? Of course they do. Wouldn't be offering you a contract unless they did. Sign here, please. Wait. Don't go away. I'll be right back. What about the contract? But, Daddy, where are you going? Daddy. What's the matter with the fellow? Well, he's a bit of an eccentric, sir, a genius, of course, but definitely an eccentric. Can't imagine where he gets it from. Truly, you'll never believe it. - I just got home... - This is beginning to be... - And your father was at my house. - A hazard. I know. I know. They told me at the house. We're rich. You know, more than that, I have succeeded. I always knew you would. You know something else? The kids were right. There's nothing so ridiculous about the idea of getting married. Well, whoever said there was? Well, Mr Potts. What's the matter? Now you'll have to marry me. So dreams can come true. Yes, they can. Yes, they can, but you have to be practical, too. You have to face the facts. Man has to see things as they really are. After all, a man with responsibilities can't walk around with his head in the clouds all the time. A man should keep his feet solidly on the ground. Oh, a man should have his dreams but a man has to learn to put those dreams to some practical use, not just sit around and think about them all the time. ♪ Oh, you, pretty Chitty bang bang ♪ ♪ Chitty Chitty bang bang, we love you ♪ ♪ And our pretty Chitty bang bang ♪ ♪ Chitty Chitty bang bang loves us too ♪ ♪ High, low, anywhere we go ♪ ♪ On Chitty Chitty we depend ♪ ♪ Bang bang, Chitty Chitty bang bang ♪ ♪ Our fine four-fendered friend ♪ ♪ Bang bang, Chitty Chitty bang bang ♪ ♪ Our fine four-fendered friend ♪ ♪ It's uncategorical ♪ ♪ A fuel-burning oracle ♪ ♪ A phantasmagorical machine ♪ ♪ It's more than spectacular ♪ ♪ To use the vernacular ♪ ♪ It's wizard it's smashing ♪ ♪ It's keen ♪ ♪ Oh, Chitty, you Chitty pretty Chitty bang bang ♪ ♪ Chitty Chitty bang bang, we love you ♪ ♪ And Chitty, in Chitty pretty Chitty bang bang ♪ ♪ Chitty Chitty bang bang, what we'll do ♪ ♪ Near, Chitty, far, Chitty, in our motorcar ♪ ♪ Oh, what a happy time we'll spend ♪ ♪ Bang bang, Chitty Chitty bang bang ♪ ♪ Our fine four-fendered friend ♪ ♪ Bang bang, Chitty Chitty bang bang ♪ ♪ Our fine four-fendered friend ♪ ♪ Chitty Chitty bang bang Chitty Chitty bang bang ♪ ♪ Fine four-fendered Chitty Chitty friend ♪
