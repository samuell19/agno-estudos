Ugh! Ugh! Ahh! Ugh! Wow. What a gorgeous town. Hey, can we stop and have a look around? I want to do some shopping. Sure. After working four shifts in a row at that hospital, I want to buy you a present. Anything look good? Yeah. Let's stop and check out that store. Perfect. Spot right in front. This place is full of gorgeous things. Treasure galore. Hm. Oh. - Jenny? - Yeah? Come here. Sir, I'm very busy. Can I help you? Actually, you can't. But you can help her. Anything she wants, she gets. Sir, this isn't the dollar store. Than it's a good thing I don't have a limit. - May I call you Mrs...? - Please call me Jenny. - What was your name? - Clint. Call me Clint. - Sweetheart? - Mm-hmm. This place isn't my style. I'm gonna go grab a glass of wine over at that bar we saw when we pulled in. Okay. Don't leave me too long. I'll only be a few minutes. - What time is it, hon? - It's Monday. Sweetheart, time not day. Ah, 11:01 AM. I appreciate the precision. Hey, come over here with us. Let me buy you a drink. - You're not from around here. - Lucky me. I noticed you were perusing some of my fine wines as you walked in. Well, I do consider myself a connoisseur. My kind of guy. - What do you want to drink? - Red wine. - Cab? - Give me the Pinot noir. You got it. All right. It sets the soul of the grape free. Just the sound of it makes me want to pee. Hey, now. You know, you're gonna like it around here. Ah, and why do you say that? Because... there is a glut of beautiful women here this time of year. And none of the men around here dress like you. You've attracted the attention of one of the locals. Send her a martini. My tab. You got it. Can I ask you something? It's Olivia. Presumptuous. I was gonna ask you to stop staring at me. Oh, that's not gonna happen. Don't I know you? I know you. Maybe from one of your dreams. So if I want to see you again, all I have to do is pop a few Ambiens? Fuck Ambien. I like to put a man to bed the old fashioned way. - Tire him out. - A shy one, aren't you? Here. Gets cold at night. Unfortunately, I don't think my girlfriend would appreciate your assets as much as I do. Oh, you think your girlfriend's enough to stop me? I like a girl with goals. Hmm. Sadly, I need to go. - I'll get your change. - I didn't ask for any. Come back. You're gonna be in town for a while? I will. - Where's the nearest hotel? - Couple of blocks up. You can't miss it. The Grand Pollard. And if you get a chance to slip out, I'll show you some sight seeing. I know you, Olivia. Hmm. Have a good rest of the day. Hey, you. Did you miss me? You were all I could think about. - Did you have fun shopping? - Look what I found. - You like it? - That place was selling this? Yeah. I know. I got some stuff for my patients, too, that I'll know they'll like. And, here's your credit card. I didn't use it. Just, I don't know, buy me something when you're thinking of me. Get in the car. I found a romantic hotel for us. Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Enjoy your stay. Welcome to the Grand, sir. Can I help you with your luggage? Are you here for a special occasion? Thank God you asked me that. Yeah, we're celebrating. We're always celebrating. I just can't remember what. And I don't want to end up sleeping in that car if I piss her off. Could you discretely find out what the occasion is? I am on it, sir. I will figure it out. She'll never suspect a thing. Let me thank you in advance. Uh... thank you, sir. Uh... I am on it. You can count on me. Uh, check-in is right this way. Welcome, sir. What name is your reservation under? Unfortunately, we don't have a reservation. I am so sorry, sir. We are full tonight. This is our high season. I know you're busy, but could you please do something for us? - We're celebrating. - Hey, you remembered. Like I just explained, sir. This is our high season, and we are at maximum occupancy. Let me speak to the manager. Sir. We have no availability. Did you just get promoted to manager? 'Cause if not, I'm done talking to you. - Hey. You didn't need to be so mean. - She was bugging me. Plus, I'm trying to do something special for you. I know. Well, I tried to explain to him we were sold out, but he just wouldn't listen! Sir, I'm sorry to inform you that... How may I be of assistance? I need a room for the evening. But of course, sir. May I offer you the Owner's suite? - But we are... - Now we're talking. The Owner's suite sounds perfect. Sir... I will have your reservation made up. I apologize for any confusion. I will just get your information from the computer records. Actually, we've never stayed here before. My mistake, sir. Thank you, sir. Hey. You should thank him, honey. Thank you for taking care of us. My pleasure. Do you know that guy? I have never seen him before in my life. - Is that what you want? - Hmm. - Go check out the room. - Okay. I'm gonna be right up. Follow me. It's up the stairs. This place in incredible. It's so beautiful. Oh, thank you. We try to keep it to the highest standards. When was it built? Ahem. Good question. Uh, no one really knows. I mean, it's old for sure. Hmm. We like to say it's always been here. So, no one actually knows how old it is? Um, maybe the bartender. He knows everything. He's the only local who's been here long enough to know the hotel's whole story. But, he can't be that old. Uh, why hasn't this town been developed more? It's so beautiful. It's so remote. And the only way here is the tunnel. Once you're here, no cell phonetower will help you. And you are isolated from the living. Separated from the rest of the world. Well, people come here to disappear. Sounds like something you'd read about in a murder mystery book. Well, this place is a bit controversial. I guess you'd say. Some people don't think this place exists. What do you mean? - Well, you'll see. - Oh, thank you. We are so glad we stumbled upon this place. Oh. Thank you. You know, I bet it's beautiful at night, too. You know what? I cannot wait to take a walk underneath the stars tonight. Uh, I wouldn't do that if I were you. Why? We have, um... bears. Uh... will that be all, ma'am? Uh, yes. Thank you so much. Okay. Magnificent piece, isn't it? It truly is. Most people that have seen it just ignore it. They never appreciate how ornate it really is. It really is a unique piece of art. I feel like I've seen it before... but I can't put my finger on it. I'm sure you've seen it. Hey, you. Hey, I was thinking maybe we could go grab dinner downstairs in the hotel. I love the idea. I just need a few minutes to get ready. - Hmm. - What do you think of the room? I love it. It's so beautiful. Okay. Go get ready. Every night I have to do that, too. - I just want to thank you all. - Cheers. That was an amazing meal. Hey, did I tell you about the new travel nurse at the hospital? Sweetheart? Baby, are you ignoring me? - What, hon? - Are you okay? - I'm fine. - Hey. When the bellhop took our luggage up to the room, he acted really weird about going outside the hotel at night. Like it might be dangerous. He's probably just worried about being attacked at night by a kangaroo or something. I was curious. Why did the guy at the front desk seem to know you? Hey. Look at me. Thank you for dinner, handsome. - Seriously, are you okay? - I'm fine. I'm just experiencing déjà vu. Baby, that happens to me all the time. Have we been here before? Well, the guy at the front desk certainly seems to think so. But, no, honey, uh, we haven't. It's strange, 'cause I have this sense that I have. Uh, I can't speak for all the women you've been with, - but... - Sweetheart, I'm not trying to start a fight. I'm just commenting that I feel like we've been here before. Hmm. You're looking at that piece of furniture more than you're looking at me. Because I've seen before and it shouldn't be there. It's bothering me for some reason. I really don't understand. But if you're so obsessed with it just... buy it like you do everything else. I don't want to buy it. And I have a feeling it was put there - to hide something. - Okay. You sound crazy. That furniture is exactly where it's supposed to be. Baby, stop. First time in my life I've been jealous - of a piece of furniture. - Sweetheart. I'm just messing with you. Uh! Okay, baby. I actually thought you were going crazy there for a minute. Let's go. Hey. Love you so much. Don't you ever do that to me again. I didn't know you were such a good actor. Do I get the Oscar? Not that good. Tom! I don't know if I'm mad or if I'm jealous. Hmm? What? What the fuck is going on? What is it? It sounds like somebody's about to be murdered. What're you talking about? What'd you think, they're singing Christmas carols? What are you talking about? You don't hear that? What're you doing? Hey. Wait! Hey! No! Hey! What the fuck is going on in there? Baby, you're gonna wake everybody up. - What're you doing? - Open the door now! Baby, you need to calm down. What is the matter with you? Help! Ugh! Help! Help! Help! Get your lazy asses up there! It sounds like somebody's about to be murdered! - Call the police! - Sir, are you okay? Am I okay? That's what you respond with? I am so sorry to alarm you guys. Honey, I think we need to go back to bed. Am I the only one that's gonna do something about this? Sir, maybe we should get you some water. Somebody is in grave danger, and you need to do something! - Sir, what room? - 327! Sir, that's impossible. What, you think this place is so fucking good domestic violence couldn't possibly happen? Sir! Maybe you should calm down. I am so sorry. Help! Help! - Sir. - Sir! Please! - Help! Help! - Sir! Open the door now or I'm gonna beat your fucking ass it! Sir, you are damaging the door! I am going to have to call security! - Back off! - Help! Sir? Check the bathroom! There's no one there. There's no one here. Hey, I have no idea what's going on right now, but, please, can you calm down? Everything's... everything's gonna be fine. Okay? I'm going to call the hotel doctor. I think that's a good idea. Come on. Can we just go back to the room now? Come on. I'm sorry. All right, everyone. Nothing to see here. Let's go back to our rooms. Thank you. I'm so sorry. Well, the good news is that he's physically fine. And the bad news? The bad news is that this has been quite an episode. Have you ever felt endangered? I'm not sure what you mean, doctor. Irrational behavior. Hallucinations. I'm a bit concerned about you. Look. I... I'm not sure what you're getting at, but he wouldn't hurt a fly. Are you a doctor or a therapist? - Would you know the difference? - Yeah, I just might. I work in I.C.U. Call me immediately if anything like this happens again. I don't care if it's day or night. Yeah, I... I won't need to. I think you're totally overreacting about a case of sleepwalking. - Are you covering for him? - Covering for him? He only got upset because he thought someone was in danger and he wanted to help them. Maybe he needs a little attention. He seems a bit showy. Maybe a little insecure. Okay. He is an orphan who put himself through college and donates more money to charities every year than you're probably gonna earn in a lifetime. So, if his success seems showy, than maybe you're the insecure one. Good night, doctor. You making friends over there? - I don't like him. - I don't like him either. The first thing out of his mouth was that he thought I was crazy and that everyone else thought I was, too. Hey. You are not crazy. I could hear a woman scream. I swear I was only trying help. Hey, you probably just heard someone's TV, thought it was real. - Can I ask you something? - Yeah. I hate it here. Let's go first thing in the morning. Let's just go home. We are checking out. I'm afraid that will not be happening. I think you might have misunderstood me. I said I'm checking out. I'm not asking you. I understood you the first time. Is this about checking out early? I'll pay for the room. I'll pay for ten rooms. I want to leave. Sir. As much as it would make my day to show you our door here at the Grand Pollard, after that ghastly show you put on last night, it is with deep regret that I cannot honor your request. I have just been informed by the officer of the law there has been a major accident in the Macon tunnel. No one will be leaving this area for at least the next few days. And, sir, we do not wish to put someone as ill as yourself on the street. How 'bout and airport? I am so very sorry, sir. There is no way out. Hey. I'm gonna go for a walk. I need some alone time. Are you sure you don't want me to go with you? - I'm okay. - Okay. Don't be too long, all right? - I won't be long. - Okay. I'll make sure the luggage gets up to the room. - What time is it? - It's 11:01. Seems like it's always 11:01 AM. No. Motherfuckers! There's no accident. I need to get Jenny. Oh! I need to get Jenny! He was yelling at the staff because they were not adhering to his orders. What were the orders? He wanted the staff to call the police. Of course, they knew the room was empty, so they knew he was hallucinating. How did they know the room was empty? Because it was room number 327. We have not had a guest in that room since that fateful night. I guess you could say we're a bit superstitious. We do not want to disturb the dead. Here we go again. - Hey, what's wrong? - We need to get the fuck out of here! What? Those crazy psychos who told us that the tunnel was blocked. I saw the tunnel. It's wide open. Well, let's go. I'll just quickly pack. No, you don't understand. Fuck packing. We need to get the fuck out of here. I saw some crazy shit. We're in danger. May I help you, sir? What're you doing? You can't just take the key... Si... sir, no! I... I need a valet ticket! Name and room number. Sir! I can't let you take the car! Hey! He is out of his mind. I went for a walk and I saw this group of monks and they were carrying something, - and something was weird. - What were they carrying? So I followed them into the forest. They started doing some type of satanic ritual. They were humming and when they saw me, they chased me. They came after me. I ran for the mountain road and when I got to it I could see the tunnel. It was wide open. Clear as can be. They fucking psychos are in on it together. They don't want us to leave. - They lied to us. - What do you mean? I mean that they're all in on it. Sir, you can't drive on these roads like that. I need you to lower your speed. It's dangerous. Anyway, the Macon tunnel up here is closed. There's been a major accident. It's gonna be a few days. I need you to back your vehicle up and head back to where you came from. Hey. It's okay. We'll just go back to the hotel and I'm sure it's only gonna be a day or two. I'm so sorry to be putting you through this. I'm just not myself, and I don't know what's going on. Look. I'm sure it's only gonna be a day or two. Maybe it's a chance for you to de-stress from work. And I think it's someone up there's way of saying you need to take a day or two off to relax. Everyone here is so weird. And they think I'm the lunatic after last night. And today. Hey. Who cares what they think? We came here to get away. And maybe it's a blessing in disguise that we're stuck here together. Come here. And I'm sure that we can still have plenty of fun. Hey. Come on. Lighten up. Babe, I'm tired. Sweetheart, it's a bit early to go to bed. Yeah, I know. It's just been a really long day. I'm still a bit wound up. Why don't I order us up a bottle of wine? Hmm, no thanks. Honestly, I'm too tired. I'm gonna go to bed. Go down to the lobby and grab one. Oh, yeah, there's a place where I can hang out with some friendly people. It'll be just like "Cheers" down there. Are you sure you don't want anything? - I can order something up. - I'm sure. Just go. They're not gonna be that rude to you. And you're spending way too much money here for them to give you a hard time anyway. I'll see you when you get back up. So... - Hmm. - Same again? - Yep. - Oh. Hey, what's going on? How's your night treating you? - Sir? - Your night? How's your night treating you? Sir, do you have a question? How may I direct you? Okay. Hit me with it. What'd you find out? - Find out? Sir? - Yeah. Why I'm here with my girl. Sir, how would I know that? Because I paid you to find out. Sir, I... I don't know what you're talking about. You've never paid me to do anything. Fine. I didn't pay you. I tipped you. I need a drink. Sir, after last night, do you really think getting a drink is in your best interest? I think not pissing me off is in your best interest. Never mind. I know where the bar is. Hey, my man. How's it going for you? I'll be doing better after I get a little juice in me. Well, I got all kinds of juice. I got tequila juice. I got vodka juice. Hold on. I got something good for you. Where is everybody? This place was packed yesterday. Not many people in town. It's the off-season. How could people leave with the tunnel being blocked? Didn't you say it was the high-season? The tunnel was blocked for you? Wow. Well, people want to get out of town... they always find a way. Well, I am having the most stressful vacation of my life. Well, you drink that down in one gulp. It's on the house. It'll cure all your issues. - Mm. - Yeah. What the hell was that? I call it the "panty drop." You know, now I usually don't give it to a guy, but if I gave that to a girl, it would be game on. Great. So you think I wear panties. No, sir. No, but I just wanted to try it on you before I gave it to the girl from yesterday. And I would tell her it was for her from you. Mm-hmm. Hi. This is from the man down at the bar. Hmm. What're you waiting for? I just delivered to you a four-star piece of ass on a silver platter. I know. But my girl is waiting for me back in my room. Least we know where she is. And I know where you're gonna be. At her place. And she'll be riding you like a bucking bronco. Oh, I have a strange feeling about this one. You know everybody in this town already thinks I'm crazy. Yeah? Last night, I heard some noises and I woke up an entire hotel trying to save somebody that wasn't there. I'm not a shrink, and I don't care if you're crazy. I want you to nail that girl. With this gray hair, I'm not getting any booty, and I'm gonna live vicariously through you. And if anybody comes around here asking, you were here at the bar. I got your back. You again. And how are you? Thank you for the drink. It's called a "panty dropper." Oh. Well, in that case, I'll have another. - Make it a double. - You got it. So, tell me something about yourself. Parents raised you to be a good boy? Come on. Tell me something fun. You must've had some hobbies or something. Actually, I grew up in an orphanage. My parents died when I was two in a car accident. - You left that down there. - Thank you. I don't remember them. The only hobbies I ever did was doing things that I thought would make them proud. Hmm. Sorry to bring up a sore subject. My mother made me do ballet classes every day. I hated it. I had to get up early. It was awful. She thought I was gonna be a prima ballerina. Wow. I didn't realize I was talking to a ballerina. I don't know if I could call myself that. But, all of those years sitting in the splits... my legs wrapped around a bar. Let's just say, once I get my legs wrapped around you... you're never gonna be able to walk away from me. Why haven't you called me? But it's only been a day. It's 'cause of Jenny, isn't it? Didn't stop you before. How did you know her name was Jenny? Quit acting like you don't know who I am. Okay, it's really starting to piss me off. You know, I've had a real long day? I think I should go. What do I have to do to get you to fuck me? Not much. I need to go. Uh, could I get my tab? I told you it was on the house. I... I... I'm sorry. I need to go. Have a good day. Hey, Michael. You know you'll never win against her. So just enjoy it. How did you know my name was Michael? Lucky guess. Good night, Jen. Hello? Who's in here? Is there anybody here? I knew you couldn't keep away from me. What the hell are you doing? You scared the living fuck out of me. Well, hope I didn't scare all the fuck out of you. No, no. We can't do this. Not here. Not now. We'll wake up the entire hotel. Well, since when are you scared of waking up the hotel? - I can't do this. - Oh, come on. - Michael? - Fuck! - It's not what you think. - Why are you in here? Um, we were just talking. We? But why... why are you back in here again? I... I don't know. The door was open. I think you're losing it. And you're starting to scare me. Why are you back in this room again? I... I don't know. I think something's wrong with me. Just go to bed and stay in bed. I'm so sorry to be putting you through this. Jenny, you awake? I can't sleep. Jenny? Jenny! Jenny? "All The Lies Lead To What Lies Here." Jenny, is that you? What's going on? What do you want from me? What do you want from me?! My God! What're you gonna do to me?! Get your hands off me! Help! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Put me back! Put me back! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Take me back to the hotel! What're you gonna do to me?! Let me out! Let me out of here! Let me out! Let me out now! Help! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Let me out! You can't do this! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Help! Let me out! Please! Please let me out! Please let me out! Hey! Where are you taking me? Let me out of here! Let me out of here now! Help! Let me out! Help! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Help! Help! What do you want to do with me?! Let me out of here! Who are you? What're you gonna do to me? Let me out now! Help! Let me out of here! Please let me out! Please let me out of here! Let me out of here! What are you gonna do to me? Who are you?! What do you want from me? Answer me! What're you gonna do to me?! What're those lights? What're those light? What're you doing? No! No! No! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! - Oh, thank God. - What's wrong? - I had a terrible dream. - What was it? You were missing. And then those evil monks came out of nowhere, and they tried to burn me alive. Hey, it was just a dream. It... it's not just a dream. - This place is evil. - This place is not evil. You're just overworked and you haven't slept. Look. You've been sleepwalking and now you're having nightmares. I'm sorry. I need to get a grip. They wanted to burn me alive. - But it's just a dream. - That's right. It was just a dream. Okay? I just want to get out of this bed. Hey. You do need to get some sleep. You haven't had any real rest since you've got here. The last thing I want to do is sleep. I know. But that's what you need to do. Okay? I promise you'll be all right. Once you get some rest, you're gonna feel like yourself again. - Okay? - I'm... I'm afraid I'm gonna have another bad dream. Or I'm gonna wake up and you're gonna go missing. Between me and you, I think your nightmare ghouls will be far more scared of you than you of them. Okay? And I am gonna go missing, but just for a few minutes. I'm gonna find us some coffee and some breakfast. Okay? Will you put a hazelnut in my coffee? I don't know. Will you promise to get some sleep? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hey, is anyone here? I'm sorry. Were you just standing there? Yeah. Yeah, I've been right here. Are you okay? You seem a little shaken up. Yeah, I'm... I'm fine. That's just weird. Are... are you sure you were just standing there? I'm sure. I mean, I'm sort of everywhere. Well, uh... I just came down to get breakfast, but it doesn't look like the kitchen is open. So, you know, I'm just gonna go back to my room. Okay. How's Michael? He, uh... he have another bad dream? How did you know that? How do you know Michael? - I shouldn't say anything. - Shouldn't say what? I shouldn't. Really. No really. Say what? Oh, do you think that Michael's been acting kinda different lately? 'Cause... he's got this secret. And I know about it. Okay. Who are you? And what are you talking about? Jennifer, it's fine. I'm your friend. Hey, come with me. I just checked into my room. I'll show you this picture. It'll explain everything. - How do you know my name? - Oh, you see, uh... I know a lot about you. - Come with me. - What room are you in? 327. 327. 327. Baby, I'm hungry. I finally got some real sleep. Jenny, are you here? Good morning, sir. How may I help you? I'm supposed to be meeting somebody for breakfast. Of course, sir. And what time can you be expecting them? I think she may be here now. Sir, you are the first customer of the day. Oh, you know, she actually said she was gonna come down and pick up breakfast. Sir, you are the first customer of any kind all day. I've been at the front all morning. You know, I'm a bit confused. Do you mind if I take a look around the dining room just in case she slipped in through the back door? Sir, she's not in here. Sir, would you like me to make a reservation for you? Um, I think I'm just gonna take my chances and hope that I can get a table when I get back. Jenny, where did you go? This is not like you. Can you take these over there for me? Thank you. Hey. Can I ask you something? Have you seen my girl? Sir? I don't know what you're talking about, sir. - Can I help you? - I get it. You don't like me. Can you please just tell me if you've seen my girl? - Your girl? Sir... - You know... Jenny. The blonde. She's been by my side every moment that I've been trapped here. I don't know who you're talking about. What do you mean? I mean I don't know this person you're describing. You helped us with our luggage. I tipped you to find out what the occasion we were celebrating was. I'm sorry, sir. I've never seen you with a woman at all. There she is. Thanks for nothing, asshole. Sweetheart, I was so worried about you. I thought you were only gonna be a minute when you went down for breakfast. I thought one of these ghouls had done something to you. Excuse me. Get your hands off of me! Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I... I'm sorry. What the hell is going on? Hmm. What the fuck do you think you're doing? I'm sorry to bother you, sir. I... oh... I just wanted to make sure everything was okay. Bullshit! You're trying to steal from me! Your name's Clint, right? How the fuck do you know my name? I came in here the other day with the blonde, Jenny. I gave you my credit card and I told you she could buy anything she wants. Bullshit! You're trying to steal from me! I'll pay for it. You got till the count of five before I blow your fuckin' head off. - Calm down. - One! Two! Three! Four! What is this?! Oh, thank God. A friendly face. How are you doing today? How does it look like I'm doing? You can't be doing worse than me. Well, you seem busy. You got a sec to talk? Do I look like a healthcare professional? I mean, I'm sorry I don't have a couch for you to lay on. - What? - Where is everybody? Oh! Is that what you want to talk about? It's the off-season. All the people are gone. You should have checked with your, uh, travel agent I think. Just the other day this place was packed. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm sorry to trouble you. Are you gonna order a drink? Or are you just gonna bust my balls talking? I'll take a beer. Now we're talking. Good God... Will that be all? I have one more question for you. What? Have you seen the woman I came to town with? What woman? Her name is Jenny. I told you about her. If you're so concerned about the towns people disappearing, and the love of your life, maybe you shouldn't have spent so much time sucking up to that hot, hot brunette. You know what I'm saying? I had enough of your bullshit. Since I've been here, a town full of people have disappeared. Can you tell me what's going on? What do you mean? Everything's working out perfectly. What is that supposed to mean? Oh, come on, Michael, with her out of the picture you and I can be together. Out of the picture. You did this. Explain to me what you're talking about. Okay. Come here. Let me tell you something. Come here. What the fuck are you doing? Hey! I'm making our dreams come true. You are one delusional bitch. Hey, I did this for us. Okay, I showed her our picture and she saw how much you love me. What are you talking about? What picture? It's time for you to hit the road. And if I don't? What the fuck are you gonna do? Summon the townspeople? There's nobody fucking here! No, I'll summon your hooded friends. - They'll know what to do. - Oh, yeah? Get the fuck out of here! Yeah? And what are they gonna do? You're off the rails, buddy. Oh, thank God. I am so glad that you're back. I was worried sick. I had convinced myself that one of these rednecks had done something to you. Open the door, hon. You know, being away from you had a major effect on me. I don't know if I say it enough. But I love you. I know I can be a hardass. I can be stubborn. But I always love you. I didn't realize how much until I thought you were gone. Open the door, hon. I just want to hold you. "I love you... Jenny." "M." Oh, sir. Excuse me, sir? What the fuck do you want? I have a message for you. Why on earth are you bothering me? Your female companion is waiting for you in the dining room. Jenny's in the dining room? Yes. She wanted me to tell you so that you could join her. What do you want from me? I want us to be together. Mm. You're fucking insane. Come on, you don't mean that. Where's Jenny? I took care of her. Where the fuck is Jenny? Why don't you love me? I don't understand. Like from the picture. What picture? Hmm. We were so happy. Remember? Michael? Get off me, you crazy bitch. Okay, okay, okay. Come here. I'll tell you where Jenny is. Okay? Put your arms around me. Tell me you love me. I will never tell you that I love you. And I think you know where Jenny is. And if you did something to her, I will fucking kill you! Hey. Are you okay? Yeah. Help! What are you? Olivia? Look at me! I could have killed her. No! Who did you kill? Killed Jenny. No, I don't believe you. You love me. I know that you do. I will never love you! Never! Never! Never! Then I don't want to be here anymore. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Help! Help! Help! Help! Do something! Help! Help! Get in here! God, he killed her. Call the police. He slit her throat. Go! Help! Don't just stand there! Move! Help! Don't just stand there! Do something! So you admit to killing Olivia. I didn't kill anyone. I got a whole room full of people telling me not only did you kill that girl, but that they saw you do it. You telling me that every single one of them folks is wrong? I didn't kill her. So what's all that red stuff on that fancy jacket? I spilled a little wine on myself during dinner. You think you're funny? Well, listen here, city boy. 'Round here, we don't take this kind of stuff lightly. Listen to me. She said that she killed Jenny, and when I asked her about it, she killed herself. He's been sending my workers on a wild goose chase over some unknown woman. Then the female victim, Olivia, comes to us, tells us that he's mentally ill, and that she's his wife, and she's gonna take care of everything. Olivia is not my wife! I'm here with Jenny! I love Jenny! Everyone heard him threatening to kill Olivia during a fight in the lobby today. Who is this Jenny? - Is she missing? - I've been trying to tell you. Listen to me. Olivia said she killed Jenny. We need to find Jenny. Well, let's write up a missing person. - Rookie, get to writing. - Hmm. When did this Jenny disappear? She disappeared this morning. We got here on Monday. We've been here two nights. So today... Wednesday... probably around 9:00 AM. I told you he was delusional. What? Wha... what did I do? It is Monday. 11:01 AM. You're just as much delusional as you are a serial killer. Wha... what time is it? It's pitch black outside. What am I, your personal clock? What time is it? It is 11:01 AM, Monday. Look at him. Looks like he just seen a ghost. I'm gonna alert the staff. Let them know everything's under control and try to get some more information. You think you can come around here, city boy? Hmm? - Causing trouble. - We'll take good care of you, city boy. I know some locals around here that'd pay good money to get a piece of you. I bet that sounds good to you, don't it? - Huh? - What'd you say? Oh, a real smartass. Let him have it. I said gettin' ass raped sounds good to you, doesn't it, huh? What do you have to say to that? I'd say, you should lock your gun belt. Uh! No! Throw me the keys to the cuffs. You got three seconds to tell me where Jenny is. - One... - I don't know where she is. - Two... - Now, please. I swear to God. - Three! - Ugh! Manager said you were under arrest. It's okay. He found me innocent. You! Come here! You. Come here! - You... - No, no! You owe me a hundred dollars. I... I... I don't have a hundred dollars. Don't move. Consider us even. Look at you! I warned people about you! You're a murdering lunatic! Where's Jenny? I know you know who she is! I don't know what you're talking about. Are you gonna kill us, too? You monster! Well, I do still have three bullets left in the gun. Pretty appropriate for the situation, - don't ya think? - You're a coward. You're a nothing without that gun. You know... You're right. May the best man win! Ugh! Let me give you some advice, Michael. The next time, use the gun. Let me give you some advice, doc. You really should take something for that headache. You shouldn't be there. Let's see what really lies here! Ugh! Ugh! Well, what the fuck is this? What the fuck is going on?! No! No! It can't be. It can't be. Oh... oh, my God. How could they do this to you? How could they do this to you? I'm so sorry. Congratulations! Here he is! Ugh! I want to take care of someone first. Hey, Michael, my man. Have a seat. Do me a favor and leave that bloody ax by the door. I just mopped the floor. Who are those people dressed like creepy monks? Oh, Michael, don't worry about them. They're just doing their job. They're moving souls along, just not to a fun place. They are calling me a murderer. I am not a killer! I know you're not, sort of. I know that you didn't kill Olivia or Jenny, for that matter. But the five people you did kill a couple of minutes ago... Now, that's another story. But technically it doesn't count here. What's that supposed to mean? Ugh! You see what I'm saying? You can't really die here. No one can die? Where am I? The court case. All the people here that you've dealt with were important to you in your final days. Jenny, Olivia, the hotel where they died, the doctor who testified that you were crazy, try to remember. You won't have that ability soon. Do you like reality shows? And finally the day has come, convicted of double murder, his execution day has arrived in a very controversial decision. He did it. There were witnesses that said they saw him - kill the victim in cold blood. - Seriously? If he's a monster enough to kill his mistress, then he must have killed his fiancée also. There is no motive. Why would he take her on a trip and propose to her only to kill her? I mean, there's no evidence that states that he was having an affair with the other victim. In fact, the evidence points - to her being a stalker. - Oh! And why was he denied an appeal when further DNA evidence was found? - That is what arrogant men do. - Oh, really? We are not letting him use his money to get away with these murders. Not this time. Son, do you have any last words? I pray to God... that you will burn in hell for killing those two women. I was on trial, but I'm innocent. They wanted to put me to death for killing Olivia and Jenny. I remember the court. But I didn't do it. You know I didn't do it. Why can I remember now? Son, I know you didn't do it. You were wrongly convicted of a double homicide, based on what people said they saw, but they didn't. And attorneys needing a conviction in an election year. Liars, cheats, and thieves that stole your life. How did I get away? You didn't. Where am I? You're in a holding area before your final fate. Sometimes it's busy, sometimes it's not. Most people go to the sky through the tunnel. Others have a lesser fate. They are trapped and sacrificed by your hooded friends, and taken to a darker place. People in the hotel don't exist anymore. Everything seems jumbled and weird. Your mind can't make any sense of it anymore. It's all becoming a blur. And all you feel is longing. Why do I remember now? Because death is an evil thing, It gives you one last moment of clarity before it takes you. Who are they? They serve a more sinister power. Who are you? I'm just the bartender. No! I'm innocent. I don't deserve this! You can't take me! Come on! I've been waiting for you. Oh, my God. I love you so much. But you're dead. They say I did it, but you know I would never hurt you. Of course you didn't. I have a surprise for you. What? I met your parents. They're so proud of you. Your mom's been waiting a long time to give you a hug. Are you ready to meet her? The prisoner was brought into the chamber at 11:00 AM and strapped to the chair. By order of this great and just state, he was administered the death penalty via electrocution. Today, justice was served. Time of death, April 4th, Monday at 11:01 AM.
