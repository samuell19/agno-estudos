My dad always told us... nothing good ever happens after midnight. Who would'’ve thought that the very worst thing would happen during broad daylight? -What? -It'’s your dad and Jerry up here. Show me. I don'’t care if it'’s after midnight. You'’re going to stay here until whoever was screwing around and broke that mirror takes responsibility. Jerry. I was sleeping. What'’s your name again? I'’m Wade Tomlinson. Did you break that mirror? No, sir. Of course not. Keep '’em working here until somebody fesses up. I'’ll be in my office. Why didn'’t you just fess up? Coach Meyer is scary. His jokes are funny, but I'’m not sure I want to play for him. He'’s kind of intense. Yeah, I'’m glad he'’s not my father. He'’s my dad. And that was my childhood. School, basketball and those long summer basketball camps. My dad strived for perfection. He expected me to be perfect. That'’s results. But worse, I expected it of myself. He was always studying stats and recruiting new talent. Hey, nice game. I'’m Coach Meyer from Lipscomb. I know, Coach Meyer. I'’ve been going to your camp for seven years now. Oh! No wonder your fundamentals are so good. You'’re awful skinny, but maybe you can play for us at Lipscomb. I have something to say to all of you freshmen who might'’ve decided on Lipscomb because we won the national championship. There'’s something you need to understand. The reason we won the national championship is because we play as a team, not a bunch of individuals. Everyone knows their role and executes it well. So, if you were a big scorer in high school, I have news for you. You may not be a big scorer here. Your role might be something else. We'’ll let you know what that is. Jiminy Christmas, Wade, you look like puke. Did you eat like I told you to? -Yes, sir. -Well, not enough. Fill your plate, son. Skinny is easy. Muscle is hard. You look like a bean pole. I'’m still growing, sir. Well, don'’t worry, you'’ll hit puberty soon. I'’m not here to entertain you. We'’re about ready to start a new season. You'’re all out of shape. Baseline. Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! I'’m talking to you, Bob Ford! Move your butt! -I am, Coach. -Oh, I don'’t see it. I think you'’re coasting. I think you'’ve fallen in love with us winning the national championship. You'’ve got yours last year. What about your new teammates? Don'’t they deserve your best effort, too? I don'’t want satisfied players! You don'’t want me on your team? I quit! Leave your shoes in the locker. Hey, what are you stopping for, sitting around watching? Did you pay for admission, numbnuts? I guess you heard. What I heard was that Bob Ford cleared out his locker. Ah, he'’ll be back. I don'’t know. Left school. -Drove home. -Good. His mom will send his sorry butt right back here. I met her. I wouldn'’t bet against that. But you'’re going to call him, right? Let him stew for a day. It'’s 2:00 in the morning. I shouldn'’t be seeing your face at my door. Why hello to you, too, Ma. Coach is crazy. I quit. What did you say? You'’d be the crazy one. Your father works two jobs to put food on the table, and you have to walk over my dead body before you walk away from that scholarship. Now you better screw your head back on your neck. Turn your butt right back around and go back to school. And don'’t you come back here without a degree. Ma, you don'’t understand what Coach puts us through. All I know is Coach promised me he'’d take good care of you and he'’s kept his word. Don'’t you roll your eyes at me. You go on right now. Go! Get! Ma, I'’m tired. I need some sleep. Well, you'’re not getting comfortable here. You can sleep on the couch. Boy. Hello? Just a minute. Bob. Bob! -Mmm? -You have a phone call. Mmm-hmm. Bob, Coach Meyer. Hi, Coach. I heard you left school. Not smart. Your thinking'’s not too clear right now, Bob. Better head on back here before you get behind on your classes. You gotta think of the big picture. Yeah, okay. Oh, and Bob, say hi to your mom for me. See, that'’s what I'’m talking about. He just hung up without saying goodbye. That'’s all right. I'’ll say it. Goodbye. Coach, look at Bob. Don'’t make life harder than it already is by doing stupid things. The road was like his second home. He drove thousands of miles to recruit new players. If I didn'’t catch him at the breakfast table, I barely saw him. Hey, Coach Meyer. -Hey. -It'’s a pleasure to meet you. Oh. Sorry I'’m late. It was a little further than I thought. No. No, problem. Come on in. Thank you. Ah, have a seat. Anything to drink? -No. -Are you sure? I'’ve been looking forward to talking to you and your wife about Pete. I'’ve been watching him and he'’s averaging 27 points per game. Yeah, we'’re real proud of him. He'’s been playing really hard, Coach. Pete'’s mom passed away last summer. I'’m sorry. Yeah, she was murdered in New York. Oh, wow. Well, that must'’ve been rough on Pete. You know, it'’s just one of those things where it was just Pete and it was his sister here with me and it happened and we'’ve been here the last eight years. Just the three of us. And to be honest, I needed to get Pete out of New York. He was starting to make some bad decisions. Hi, Coach. Tennessee is a big switch from New York. Yes, sir. My dad packed us out one day and brought us out here... in the middle of nowhere. Well, I have another recruit to get to tonight, so... let me get right to the point. We want to offer Pete a basketball scholarship. Can I think about it and let you know? This is my first offer and... I'’m kind of waiting to hear back from a few schools up north. I have other point guards to see, so... don'’t think about it too long. Thanks for the scholarship offer, Coach. Drive safe. Really? I could never play for that guy. Why do you say that? Because I'’ve been to one of his clinics, Pops. He'’s a drill sergeant. I mean, all his players have to shave their head like they'’re in the military. Little discipline would do you some good. Yeah, maybe, but I want to play up north. Where are you going to play? You don'’t have any other offers. I'’m gonna walk on at RPI in New York. Walk on? You'’re not passing on this scholarship, Pete. Are you sure about this? Baby, I can'’t live without you. I mean, don'’t you feel the same way? You know I do. Okay, listen, I can'’t stay here and sneak around for another four years. Now trust me, you'’re going to love New York. People think differently up there. What about your scholarship to Lipscomb? I turned it down. Are you sure about the job in New York? It'’s a family business. I mean, my uncle'’s waiting for me. You'’re still coming, right? Yes, I'’m coming. So you'’ll meet me here tomorrow? Yeah, at 9:00. The Athletic Director says you haven'’t yet turned your paperwork in. I can'’t do the pre-season conditioning with the team until you do. I'’ll do it today. Jerry, do you know a John Pierce? Yeah, I know John. He goes to Dad'’s camps. -Why? -Well, I went on a date with him the other day and he was hoping he'’d see you here. John Pierce was here? He'’s a darn good ball player. Well, Dad he came in and said hello, you never looked at him. -What? -It'’s nothing new. I was watching a movie. Well, he was just trying to have a conversation with you and you just grunted. Yeah, you'’re a real charmer, Dad. I don'’t have to charm basketball players. How in the world did you ever get Mom? Dad did charm me. He was so handsome. He was a big basketball and baseball star. Uh-huh. You see she says past tense. Actually, your mother won me over when she pitched overhand to me. Burned my glove. You still haven'’t turned in your paperwork. Dad, I need to talk. I'’m right here. I don'’t want you to get mad though. Forget it, you'’re going to get mad. No, he won'’t. Not if you honestly say how you feel. I think I need a break. I don'’t think I want to play anymore. I'’m sorry, I'’m burnt out on basketball. Hmm. Well... If you don'’t have the fire in the belly, you shouldn'’t play. Don Meyer. Hey, Coach, it'’s Pete. Pete Froedden. Listen, I think that I-- Well, I know I made the biggest mistake of my life, Coach. I keep thinking about that scholarship. It'’s gone. Oh, okay. You know, I just-- I thought I'’d ask. But it would be good if you worked at camp. It'’s starts this Sunday. But it'’s Thursday and I'’m in New York. Better get on the road. All the way. All the way. Breathe. Good form. Nice. Come on. Stay focused. Excuse me. You know which way to the dorms for camp counselors? Man, I'’m beat, I just drove straight from New York. You'’re the player from New York. Yeah, you heard I was coming? Not you. A 6'’ 10" power forward. -Hutch. -Move it down. This is our 6'’ 10" power forward. I think Coach got us. What'’s your name? Pete. Pete Froedden. I'’m Hutch. Nice to meet you. Hey, man, you'’re Jerry Meyer. I played you in the regional tournament. Oh, man, you were unreal. Are you playing basketball here? No, I'’m just helping my family with the camp. Hey, wait, I don'’t think I heard you right. You'’re telling me that you'’re not playing basketball? No. Are you coming here on scholarship? I screwed that up. Long story. Watch him, Hutch. Watch him over there. As Dad'’s number of wins increased, more and more people were signing up for his summer camps. We all had to pitch in to make it work. My mother and sisters handled all the paperwork. And I helped with the campers. All right, hands up on the shoot, all right? All the players on the team had to help with the campers, too. Keep your elbows up. Tell '’em to keep their elbows up. I'’m going to show you this drill that my dad teaches, it'’s called the shooting progression drill. So, when you get your stance a little wide. Get wide, okay? And you get a little bend at the knees and go up. Shoot. Get the cookie out of the cookie jar. -Get back in there. Let'’s do it again. -Okay. Okay, Mark is here. He'’s going to demonstrate how to defend for you guys. I want you to pay special attention to how he keeps his forearm up and his feet away, his feet back. Feet free. Forearm up. Get that forearm up. Get that forearm up, Markus. Don'’t touch him. It'’s a rebound. Put your body between the ball and the basket. Make physical contact with your opponent before you make visual contact with the ball. Okay? Everybody get to the baskets. Let'’s go. Shoot. There you go. Nice. Get that rebound. - One, two, three! - Hard work! Shoot! Yeah! Hey. Hold up. Hold up. Remember what Coach said. All right. Let'’s get this right. You gotta make sure you make physical contact with your opponent first, then visual contact with the ball. Everybody remember, keep your body between the ball and the basket. Nice! Shoot! That'’s what I'm talking about. Great job. And shot. There you go, good job. Man, I'’m beat up. I'’m gouged and bruised. Yeah, welcome to Lipscomb basketball. Yeah, I wish. I wish I wouldn'’t have screwed up that scholarship. I heard. Coach offered it to you, man. You turned it down. I didn'’t think I wanted to play for him. Me neither. Yeah, but that'’s just the half of it. Dad always worked late into the night. Yeah, tell me a long story. You ready? This is a long story. Sure. I secretly dated this girl all through high school. White girl. Her name was Kate. She was so beautiful. But her dad would shoot us down on the spot if he knew about us. We were planning on getting out of state after we graduated. Planning on getting married in New York. And? We arranged to meet at 8:00 in the morning and leave from there. I showed up. I sat there on a bench and I waited. For four hours. Wow. I still love her. I'’m sorry, man. Maybe we should get some sleep. Got another long day tomorrow. Yeah, I know. The players would always try, but they could never get up earlier than him. With the academic year about to start and no scholarship, Pete didn'’t have a choice, he had to leave. Coach wants to see you before you leave. How you doing, man? Good luck, man. Pete, come in here. Don'’t worry about school. We'’ll take care of it. Huh? You showed a lot of hustle at camp. You fit in well with the guys. Hopefully it will make up for your size. I'’m sorry, Coach, but sometimes I really can'’t understand what you'’re trying to say. Are you telling me that I have a scholarship? I'’ll tell you what I tell everybody. It'’s a one year contract, renewable every year. Every time. Down, up. Down, up. Down, up. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Well, actually I did. Boot camp. This is worse than boot camp. Shh. Here comes Coach. One of your teammates skipped the math class this week. Believe this... I know everything. So, you'’ll all do push-ups to exhaustion. Maybe when you'’re done, you'’ll decide it's time to look out for each other. Down, up. This is not yoga. I'’m going to beat you. Pete, he wants to please us so bad... he has a hard time walking past my door. I wish Jerry had his desire to play. Have you talked to him? We sure could use him on the team. I'’m not going to talk anybody into playing. If he wants it, he has to decide for himself. He'’s a tough competitor. Don'’t you think he still wants it? He'’s so busy trying to be a rebel. I'’m actually going to have lunch with him today. You guys need to spend some time together. You'’re late. I suppose you don'’t believe in wearing a watch anymore either. Doesn'’t work unless you look at it. I'’m going to have a burger. I ordered. You'’ll have catfish. I had a family fish dinner coupon. -You wonder why I feel so-- -Why what? Mom said you wanted to talk. She did. I wonder why she'’d say that. Must be about you not being at chapel. I'’ve been to chapel. I heard you skipped a few. You get ten skips. I'’ve been thinking about this bas-- You have four pens in one. Only one of '’em work. I'’m going to get a drink. Pete! Good morning, Coach. I have to talk to you. You have class? -In an hour, sir. -Sit down. They don'’t work. I just bought these and they don'’t work. Come on, come with me. Wait, but Coach, I have to-- I gotta check out a player at West End High. Come with me. Let'’s take a ride. So what happened to the girl? What girl? The one you were running off with. It'’s funny, I haven't had a second to think about her. Good. It'’s not a good idea to make life choices on a high school crush. Yeah, I think I get that now. You know a lot of guys don'’t get the chance to do what they can do. I hope you do get it, '’cause I think you'd make a heck of a coach. Really? If you put your mind to it. I decided I would try working things out with Dad and play on the team again. We had a good season last year. Problem is... "good" is the enemy of "great." Let'’s remember that this season. I'’m going to tell you newcomers what I'’ve been telling these guys. Respect the game. Do not fear, but respect your opponent. Revere the fundamentals. Love the program and everyone in it. Life is a team sport. Life is made up of relationships. You may not remember your wins and losses, but you will remember the people you played with. Jerry thinks he'’s heard it all before. I got news for you. Until you walk the walk, you haven'’t proven anything to me. The more I rebelled, the more Dad rode me. So McQuiddy Gym, that peaceful place I cherished throughout my childhood, became the stage for our battles. But playing the game I loved made it all worth it. That year I broke the NAIA record for assists. But it was never enough for my dad. The intensity continued. Even a scrimmage was treated like a tournament final. You ready to play? Here we go. -Let'’s go. Let's go. -One. Two. Three. Family. Come on, let'’s go, boys. Let'’s go. Let'’s go. The next year, Jerry was even better. He was the most amazing player I ever played with. It was like having a coach on the floor. We won a lot of games in those years. What I remember the most was the symmetry of movement we created. It was an incredible few years. But as they say, nothing good lasts forever. Get a touch. Get a touch. Yeah. Go. Let'’s go. Let's go. Get a touch. Pressure that ball. Pressure. Denied. Denied. Don'’t let him catch it. Time out! Time out! Jerry! You'’re playing your game, aren'’t you? Get out there! Pete, let'’s go! You don'’t listen to him. We know you'’ve got a tough deal here. Just wanted to let you know, you'’re the leader of this team. We'’re behind you. Take the hit! Time out! Time out! Take a charge! Will you all just take a charge? Do I have to show you how? Take a charge! Will you all just learn how to take a charge? Take a charge! Sacrifice your body for the team. Take a hit! The rest of you come over here and learn how to take a charge. None of you are tough enough. Take a charge! Hey! I'’ll take a charge for you! I'’ll take a charge for you! -Get back! -I quit! Take a charge! You understand what I'’m saying? Come here, wait! Come here. Let me talk to you. Hey, Coach, can I talk to you? Yeah, if you want to talk, you have to come with me. I gotta see this recruit. Coach, you were out of control yesterday. I'’m never out of control. You made everyone take a hit from you. I was demonstrating a fundamental. I really don'’t like this number one ranking these experts have bestowed upon us. Really, Coach? You don'’t want us to be ranked number one? Everyone'’s hung up about it. We'’re so busy being number one, they'’re not focused on basketball. We'’ve got a game tomorrow we'’re not ready for. Hey, go down and get those cans. Cans? But where? Right there. Use your eyes. Put them in my trunk. Maybe if you apologized. For what? I don'’t have to apologize to anyone. Not even your son? Hey, look, Pete, I don'’t have to apologize for expecting greatness from any of you. What'’s with all the cans in the trunk? Each one of those cans is worth a nickel. You know how much it costs to feed you guys on trips? Even though I felt I wasn'’t good enough for my dad, I always had the support of my teammates. Thanks, Lipscomb, for letting me make a bunch of turnovers and mistakes. Thanks for letting me play through those mistakes. And thanks for letting me galvanize teams to greatness. I didn'’t know where I was headed, but I knew I had to spend some time with myself. Good morning. Could you pick those papers up, please? You walked right by '’em. Makes everybody look bad. Thank you, ladies. Good morning. I miss Jerry. I miss him, too. Hey, Mom, how about if we sing "Silent Night"? Oh, that'’s a great idea. No. No, we don'’t need to sing in order to celebrate Christmas, Mom. Yeah, I agree. Hey, don'’t open those without your mom. I'’m going to put these in his room. Jerry? -Was that Jerry? -No. I thought I heard you say "Jerry." No. No, I said Gary. -Pass! Pass the ball! -Oh! Oh! Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Give me a break! Stay on him! Don'’t look at me! Pass! Pass the ball. Oh, numbnut! Get it back! Get it back! Oh! Are you kidding me? Whose game are you playing? Are you on a vacation? I think you are! I think you'’re in the Bahamas! Are you having a good time? Are you having a good time in the Bahamas? Wade! Come on! Pass the ball, numbnuts! Pass the ball! Pass it! Stay on him! I understood why Jerry left. I hated playing for Coach, too. That'’s because I knew he was usually right and I was wrong. But I'’ll never forget our last game. We'’re in the semi-finals of the national tournament. We had the best record in the country, and we felt pretty confident. Yeah! Let'’s go! - Let'’s go! Let's do it! One! Two! Three! - Family! Let'’s go. Let's go. Tonight, it'’s the national tournament semi-finals as the Lipscomb Bisons take on the Birmingham Southern Panthers. With the trip to the finals at stake, we'’ve got a heated match up. Textbook Coach Meyer as the Bisons work the ball into the front court. Birmingham Southern answers back quickly, and this one'’s going to go down to the final hold. Pass to Tomlinson, who drives to the hoop and scores. Bisons have the ball with only a few ticks left on the clock. Tomlinson gets the ball, he shoots. It'’s off the rim. A tough one to swallow for the Bisons and for Wade Tomlinson. Felt like I lost the playoff game all by myself. I was sick. We won 136 games in my four years at Lipscomb. We won 41 games my senior season. National record for wins. But it'’s the losses that stick in your mind. Maybe it'’s because after the losses when Coach would surprise us the most. Wade, you'’ve made that exact same jump shot a dozen times before, to win the game for us. That'’s why we came into this game with a 41-4 record. You'’ve always played your heart out, Wade. When everybody does that, usually you win. But sometimes you lose. That'’s life. If this... is the worst thing that ever happened to you in your life, I'’d say you were pretty lucky. Life is tough. I know you are all sad, seniors are leaving tonight. Tonight is the last time this group of guys will ever play together. But that doesn'’t mean we'’re not going to be all here for each other. In the good times and the bad. I may not be at all of your weddings... but I'’ll be there for the bad stuff. We have to wait and see how everyone will handle it. I was thinking the other day about how much Jerry loves you and looks up to you. I think it'’s difficult for him to be in your shadow. Uh, Jerry does just fine on his own. He'’s one of the best basketball players I'’ve ever seen, and the smartest. But have you told him that? Why should I? He knows he'’s good. Jerry needs to hear that from you. As players graduated and moved on with their lives, Dad continued to build winning teams. -Wade! -What'’s up, Coach? -It'’s good seeing you. -Good to see you. '’Sup, Pete. Assistant Coach, man. Congratulations. Hey, Wade, and who is this? Ah, this is Riley Jean, my son. -Riley Jean. -Yeah. Hey, buddy. He'’s small. Just like you. Want to play point guard? - Oh yeah. - Huh? Yeah, that jersey that you sent him, that won'’t fit him for years. Well, shrink it. Hey, buddy, you'’re going to bring it? Yeah. That'’s good. Well done. Thank you. -Man, it was good seeing you. -You, too, man. Okay, Jonathan, what was so important you wanted to talk to me that I had to leave a team meeting? Don, I have wonderful news for you. Thanks to you for building this program for the last 25 years, the University has the funds they need to build a $15 million basketball complex. The recruiting budget will quadruple. Your salary will double. -What'’s the catch? -That'’s the exciting part. We may have an opportunity to go Division One. We would do it at the end of the season. Because? Because Vanderbilt did it? Because Belmont did it? I don'’t think that's where Lipscomb belongs. It'’s just being considered. There'’s a window of opportunity for us to go in that direction. The board is just considering it. -The thinking is-- -Stupid. Don, you are three seasons away from becoming the winningest college basketball coach. If we don'’t go Division One, nobody will ever know. Jonathan, who cares? -We just thought that-- -Wrong! You thought wrong. Don, I didn'’t hear you come in. -How was your day? -They'’re talking about going Division One. -The University. -Uh-huh. Lipscomb? Division One? Yeah. How did that come about? Probably some egos need stroking. Sure, but if they do-- I'’m resigning. Well, Don, that'’s a big decision to make so quickly. You haven'’t even really given it a chance-- I don'’t want any part of it. Nashville has been our home for 25 years. I don'’t want to leave. Me neither. Before you make a decision, just... Just consider everything. Please? I made some calls on Jerry'’s behalf. You did? Yeah, Coach Race at the University of Minnesota Duluth really wants him. If he'’s ready, if we can find him. Hello? Don? Here. Something'’s happened. -Jerry? -No, it'’s Wade. Hello? Hey. He was always so afraid of the neighbor'’s pool. Oh! Oh, God. I'’m so sorry. I'’m okay. Wade needs you. -You okay? -Mmm-hmm. I couldn'’t find my boy. I'’m so sorry, Wade. Nobody should have to go through this. I can'’t even imagine the pain you must feel. Give me your eyes. Give me your eyes. You will make it through this. I promise you. We'’re all going to get through this. I'’ll never get over it. But I did make it through. Coach kept his word. He was there for the bad stuff. Well, if you talk to him, could you just have him call me? Who'’s that? No one. Well, the next time you talk to Jerry, ask him to call me. I'’ve got some news for him. Sure, Dad. Heavenly Father, we praise you... and we thank you for every blessing. We thank you for this-- this Christmas Eve dinner... and for blessing this family. -Amen. -Amen. Amen. Can'’t believe this might be the last Christmas in this house. What'’s happening to our family? I guess I just thought that we are always going to be together. I don'’t understand what's happening and now we'’ve... We'’ve lost Jerry. What do you mean? His cell phone is... turned off. No. Let'’s be grateful for our food. -I'’m not hungry. -Me neither. Promise I'’ll eat this later. Me, too. I'’ll get it. Jerry. Listen, I don'’t know where your head is about playing basketball, but there'’s a coach who's dying to have you play for him. He'’d be lucky to have you. Here'’s my letter of resignation. I'’ll give it to the president. Sorry to see this. Anything we can do to change your mind? I thought a lot about this. I coach to teach. I teach kids about life and how to try to live it the right way. I want to make them better people, not just better players. I can'’t do that at Division One. I don'’t think anybody can. Good morning, Coach. Oh, I see they'’re bringing out the big guns. A board of trustees officer in my humble office. Imagine that. Don, we'’ve been friends a long time and I know that we both want what'’s best for the University. We can make this work to everyone'’s benefit. Why mess up a good thing? With a new basketball arena, we have this opportunity to move to Division One. The advantages to the University to make the move far out-weigh any negatives. As trustees, we have to look out for the best interests of the University. Well, nobody'’s asking me about it. But you'’d be messing with the dynamics of the whole program. NAIA athletes are student athletes, emphasis on "student." Every single one of my players, over 24 years, Jim, has a degree. Division One graduation rates are disgraceful. Don, we'’re aware of what you'’ve done. We believe you can maintain the same success with student athletes on and off the court in Division One. We would like to name the new facility, the Coach Don Meyer Basketball Arena. Don'’t, Jim. Save your breath. And Jerry Meyer has the ball. He passes. They score. Jerry Meyer has just broken the national record for career assist. Get it done! -Jerry! -Oh, you'’re home! Hey, it'’s good to be out of the frozen north. What'’s going on here? You'’re back here and now we'’re leaving. Dad finally got a job. Finally. After three long months. He finally found a program he liked. Our prayers have been answered. Problem is, Mom, you and Dad are headed to Timbuktu. Actually, Aberdeen, South Dakota. Aberdeen? That'’s-- That'’s Northern State Wolves. We played them. -Hey. -Hey. How you doing? You think Mom and Dad are going to like it there? I don'’t know. What do you mean? It'’s in the middle of nowhere. But it'’s a good basketball town. I know, but I worry about them. They'’ve been here for 25 years. It'’s going to be a pretty big change for them. They'’ll be fine. You guys will see. Where is Dad? I'’ve been calling him. Me, too. I'’m getting worried. -Hey, Dad. -Jerry. Heard about Northern. It'’s a good place. We'’ll see. Lots of memories here. I know. I was here for most of them. Special place. Sacred. They'’re building this fancy new facility. I heard. Wouldn'’t have been the same. It'’s probably true. Time to move on. My best years were here. Mine, too. The players at Northern had no idea what was headed their way. I wondered how many would stay on the team. Good morning, there'’s a paper on the ground there. Please pick it up. I didn'’t drop it, sir. You think I dropped this? Coach Meyer? I'’m Andy Foster. I wanted to be the first player to welcome you to Northern State University. You need a high, one second follow through on your free throw. We need to get two to three more rebounds per game from you. We need two to three more points from you. Yeah. Here. Watch these. Twice. I want notes on those tomorrow. Okay. Thank you. Nice meeting you. -Hey, man. Sunny Wicks. -Hey. -Andy. -And this here is Steve Smiley. We'’re the two new freshman. Sunny and Smiley, that could be rough. Yeah. -We'’re about to meet Coach. -I just met him. -Cool. We heard he was a great-- -No, no, no. He'’s a gem. Good luck. -Coach Meyer. -Sundance Wicks. I'’m Steve Smiley. Did you bring notebooks and pens? Uh, notebook? No. Why not? You should always have something to write with. Find paper and pens. First rule... everybody takes notes. Second rule-- Are you ready for the second rule? -Uh, yes. -Second rule. Everybody says, "Yes, sir." "No, sir." "No, ma'’am." "Yes, ma'’am." Yes, sir. Third rule is, everybody picks up trash. We expect our players to show respect, and gratitude for all the people who work at this university as well as any schools we are playing at. That starts with the janitors. We will keep our locker room neat and tidy. At away games, we will leave their locker rooms meticulous. The way some of these teams leave locker rooms, it'’s disgusting, unacceptable. Give me your eyes. The way you measure someone'’s character, is how they treat people who can'’t do them any good or can'’t fight back. What'’s a poor janitor got to do when these slobs leave him with a big mess? He gets to clean up all the crap. He can'’t call the coach and complain. For all you know, I suck. For all I know, you guys suck. We'’ll just have to wait and see what happens. I'’m on my way to lunch. It'’s nice to meet you, sir. Line up. Get out your notebooks. You were told to bring notebooks. I'’ve been watching film on all of you and it'’s not good. It'’s not good at all. Lots of selfishness. There are certain people you encounter in life... that you'’ll be thrilled to be around. These are energy givers. Then there are energy takers. You don'’t want to be around them because they suck all the energy out of you. This team is full of them. As a player, you either bring energy to the team, or you take energy from the team. If that'’s the case... I don'’t want you. What does writing have to do with playing basketball? We need the energy givers to emerge as the leaders of this team, to energize this team. And it better happen sooner rather than later. Let'’s see how in shape you are. From the looks of it, not very. Let me see how long you can run. Baseline. Go, go, let'’s get it. Go, go, go, move it. Let'’s go! Move up! Get in-- Hands! Hands up. Hands up. Move your feet. Move your feet. Help side. Help side. Move your feet! Put your hands up! Keep your hands up! Get down! Get down! Stance! Keep your hands up, okay? Come on, guys, take notes. Tanner, come on, man. Chris, are you serious? Dad lost half the team at Northern in the first month. Then, it got worse. Get in your opponent'’s space. Don'’t give him room to maneuver. Stay close, within six inches. Partner up. Let'’s go! Get close! Closer! Keep your hands up! Move your feet. That would be a foul, mad dog. Dad always said, if it comes down to a decision between an individual and the team, the team always wins out. Finally. Only took a month. Feels good, Coach. It really does. Thanks again. You'’re a natural leader, Sunny. I'’ll give you that. I like the way you'’re challenging these guys. Well, not much a freshman can do. Yeah, well, they never place too much emphasis on seniority when it comes to leadership. Leaders are born. You'’re a natural leader. Thank you, sir. Don'’t worry. I got your back. He kept losing players until there were only seven left. What'’s Don Meyer done with our championship team? Our starters have disappeared. I think Meyer killed them off. I'’m hearing rumblings that some on the Board are in shock and not happy to say the least. They hire a guy with references like John Wooden and Pat Summit and what does he do? He'’s unraveled our championship team. Is he the same Don Meyer that'’s closing in on Bobby Knight'’s record? Or is this some other-- -Well? -Well, what? -You get yourself fired today? -No, not yet. Bob Olson says he thinks he knows what I'’m trying to do. He wants me to gear up for a kids summer camp. -That'’s great news. -Yeah, maybe. We'’ll see what these players have. They need a lot of work. I can help you with the camp. Well, that would help. The person I really need is Jerry. Give him a call. Nah, Jerry'’s busy. Maybe he can rearrange his schedule. Yeah. It'’s worth a try. Look at the post. Look at the post! He'’s wide open! Put it on him! Can I talk to you, Coach? Sure... Steve. You got one minute. Oh, okay. I know you want me to continue to register, but... I think I can help the team. I think you can, too, Steve, next year. No, I mean, I'’m ready to play now. I know I can help. We all have to trust each other. Everyone'’s got another role, so we can all reach our true potential. Do you trust me? You had 30 seconds. -Hello? -Jerry. Hey, I need your help. I have to rebuild this team from scratch. Now I have this summer camp to run. I'’m sorry, Dad, I'’m swamped. Oh, well, I... I thought we could run this thing together. Like we used to. -I'’m sorry. -No. Don'’t worry about it. Yeah. Talk to you later. All right. Later. Dad turned it all around and made Northern a championship team. He was going to pass Bobby Knight'’s winning record. Pulled it off, brother. Hey, not a bad finish after how we started. -Hey, we'’re celebrating. You coming? -Yeah, um-- Yeah, I'’ll be right there. The new season started and Dad continued his winning streak. Take a shot, Steve! Time out! Time out! You'’re not thinking out there! You all right? Everybody, sit down. I'’m sorry, Steve. I'’m sorry for losing control. It was wrong. Very wrong. I was so frustrated, you were over-thinking. When you start believing in yourself and your own instincts, it'’ll come naturally. Steve'’s the most improved player on this team. Nobody works harder than him on this team. -Hey, man, you okay? -Yeah. Yeah, I'’m okay. Dad wore himself to the bone recruiting new players. His kind of players. Like Kyle Schwan. 12 seconds remaining, the Wolves are down by three. Take it down. Take it down. And with a half second left, Sunny Wicks has drawn the foul and will head to the line. Sunny Wicks ties it up. Wicks has one shot remaining and a chance to win the game. Sunny, remember your form. He makes it and the Wolves win the game. The Wolves were back on top. Dad continued to rack up wins. But it was never enough for Dad. And with all the home games, away games, and hours on the road recruiting... something had to give. It'’s your dad and Jerry up here. What? Give me that. -Come on, Coach. -Hey, Collin, hurry up. -Coach, wake up. -Somebody call 9-1-1. If Dad was going to survive, it was because of the toughness he learned from his father. Don! How many times I gotta tell you, boy? Stay with me. No, Coach. Wake up. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, forgive our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Deliver us from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen. Don. Come here. What'’s his most recent vitals? 96 over 62. -Do you have any meds? -1600 CCs lactated Ringer. Thank you, sir. Did you see any meds with him? You can'’t do anything right, can you? You left the gate open, the pigs got out. Now that'’s your job. You gotta keep that gate closed. Go and get some 4x4'’s. We gotta get that bleeding stopped now. Mrs. Meyer... I have to be honest with you. Your husband'’s in really bad shape. His internal injuries are extensive and he completely severed his main leg artery. We'’re having him life-flighted to Sioux Falls. They'’re just better equipped to handle this level of trauma. I'’m really very sorry. Okay, we'’re going to shock. Okay, stop compressions. All clear. Get off! Dad said we couldn'’t play on the tractor. Scalpel. Mrs. Meyer, I'’m Dr. Strand. -Hi. -Hi. Okay, he'’s resting. Um, this was a very serious accident. We have been working very hard on your husband just to keep him alive, and I gotta tell you, there was a couple moments that it was touch and go. He had lacerations to the liver. He had damage to his lung. Spleen couldn'’t be saved, and I had to remove parts of his small intestine. But, as of now... he'’s stable. I'’m sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you a very serious question, though. Were you aware that your husband has cancer? I'’m very sorry. It'’ll be okay. It'’s gonna be all right. I think Dad wants to write something. It says, "How long before I can coach?" He'’s back. I love you, too, Dad. Don'’t worry, Coach. Numbnuts is here. They'’re taking Don'’s leg tomorrow. Pray for him. I need you to countdown from ten. Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven! Six! Don! You have five seconds to get back over here. Dear Lord, please watch over our coach. Hey, Coach. How do you feel? We sent Carmen back to the hotel to get some rest. But... don'’t worry, '’cause me and some of the guys-- we'’re here to take care of you. We'’ll take turns... and make sure you stay medicated. Coach needed watching over. We did 12-hour shifts. Every 10 minutes he had to hit this morphine button for his pain, but it didn'’t really dent it. Coach slept an hour or two at a time, but mostly he talked. His presence was so full of grace, it was almost like someone else was speaking through him. Dad began his rehab as soon as he was able. Nothing was going to stop him. We continued to help him. It was time to give back to him, what he had taught us. Strength is hard, weak is easy. No whining, no complaining. No excuses. Dad returned to the gym the morning after he was released from the hospital. Hey, you seen this guy over here? Defense! Pass it! Swing! Kyle! You'’re still prancing around like a horse. Pass the ball. You'’re still dancing. He was back. Let'’s run it again. Once Dad was back, he continued his quest to become the winningest coach in NCAA history. Nine oh three, nine oh three... Nine oh three, nine oh three... Nine oh three! Ladies and gentlemen, Don Meyer has just broken Bobby Knight'’s record. He is the winningest coach in NCAA history. Listen to me, we'’re not here to celebrate this record. We'’re here to progress as a team. Everybody got that? Okay. We'’ll never be able to thank all of you, but you know how much it means to us, and you need to keep praying for the leg to recover, and for the cancer to maybe go away, but most of all, you need to pray for the spirit, to our family, and to our team. Congratulations. Let'’s go out and celebrate. I got to see a recruit. I won'’t be long. Good morning, sleepy head. What time is it? -Noon. -Noon? I missed practice. First time ever. That was an exhausting trip. I don'’t know how many more of those I have left in me. It could'’ve been my last. You'’re just tired today. I'’m tired most days. Every day. I'’m operating at 50%. I don'’t have any juice left. All my energy goes into fighting pain. I know. I just don'’t want the kids to be cheated. Give me your eyes. You wouldn'’t do that. Last night, I woke up thinking... I don'’t have a plan B. I'’ve been coaching my whole life. There'’s never been a plan B. I might need to start thinking of one. I think it'’s time. I think it'’s time I retired. It'’s been a tough season for you all. I'’m sorry for that. It'’s not right that my situation has affected you. I'’ve given you my all, but now it'’s not enough... to do the things I need to do to help you. I can no longer... you know-- I can no longer coach you the way I want to. I'’ve thought a lot about this... and I think it'’s the right time for me to retire. I hope you know how much I love you. People say Dad has mellowed since he retired. But it'’s all a matter of perspective. What I do know, is he'’s the perfect person to turn a boy into a man. All right, now switch to the left. Left hand. Left hand. There you go. To say Coach changed my life, would be the biggest understatement. Keep it going. Keep it going. Confident with the ball. Confident. There you go. You can'’t help somebody until you first help yourself. Head up. There comes a time when winter asks what you'’ve done all summer. Dad taught us that life is all about relationships. He made all of us brothers, because he treated us like his many sons. Hustle him, boy. Let'’s go! Back up! Fix it! Are you done? John, sack away! Keep the game simple. Keep it simple. AJ, take the shot. Drop down, Chris. We want the help side people in position.
