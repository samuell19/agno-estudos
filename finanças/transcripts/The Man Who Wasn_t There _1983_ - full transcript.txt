( distant drone of helicopter ) MAN 1: First time for the Washington Monument. Come on, stone head, make a left turn here. MAN 2: Gimme some of that beer. MAN 1: Buy your own. Riley and I will take it up to Ten Duyck. Wait here. Hey, Carter... pick me up a hotdog on the way back. Yeah, get him a cobra with mustard and mayonnaise. Screw you. Screw you. What are you lookin' at? The space between your teeth. ( dramatic theme playing ) ( indistinct ) Mice! Good afternoon, General. General Podrido-Carnitas. His excellency, General Alejandro Podrido-Carnitas. Ambassador of the Republic of Argentina. ( speaks in foreign language ) Ambassador Hajji Rastafani. Archipelago of Palawan. Unhand me! Don't grab me like that! ( continues gibberish ) Rastafani, Palawan! SAM: Mister Ambassador. Welcome, it's good to see you again. I can assure you, Mister Cooper, that my government will file a sharp protest over this shoddy treatment of its dutifully accredited representative, um, oh yes. The United States values the friendship of Palawan very highly, Mister Ambassador. If you've been treated discourteously, I'll see that whoever's responsible is reprimanded. Well, then you can start with whoever is responsible for the food. In every other room, they are being served caviar, and quail, and fresh fruit, and bananas. And what do we get here? ( laugh ) Chicken balls and fish guts. Chicken giblets, Mister Ambassador. I know chicken balls when I see them... h-however briefly. You-hoo, just a moment. Don't go 'way. You, just a... Hi. ( Grey grunts and gasps ) ( coughs and gags ) I ah, I forgot my camera. I'll be right back. ( Grey coughs ) Look out. Look out! WOMAN: Hey, where you goin'? Get outta my way! Sir, that's not a twist-off. Is Rastafani filing another protest? Frankly, Hassan, I don't blame him. Oh, there has clearly been a mistake, Tohfa. There is no way in the world that your country can be seated ahead of mine. Their countries are pimples! At best. I told them to give us a round table. What do you think you are doing, you Amazon? ( grunts ) Ha! Excuse me. Whatta you... ( speaking in foreign language ) Sam! You're supposed to be walkin' down the aisle in 15 minutes. I know. I know! I know! Yuck. ( Rastafani growls ) ( shouts ) ( sighs ) Come here, you bloody bastard! Huh? Come here, Riley. Stop! Come here! Hey! Where's Riley goin'? Let's go! What's he doin'? Come on, move the bottle, huh? Drive, let's go! Drive, drive, drive! Ladies and gentlemen, please! Schmucks! Come on, let's get outta here. You can't help this. SAM: I can't just... Whoops, excuse me, you okay? I'm not doing a very good job as your best man. Oh, it's my fault... but Amanda will be furious. Have you ever seen Amanda furious? I once saw her mildly annoyed. Well, then you know what I mean. Are you Cooper? Yes. The Assistant Secretary wants to see you! I'm, I'm late for a wedding. Well, then I'd count on being even later. You don't understand, it's, it's my wedding. Well, then you have nothing to worry about. They can't start without you. This guy's great, huh? Wait here. Great! Great! ( both sigh ) ( protesters shouting ) PUG FACE: He's over there! FIREPLUG: Well, move it! DRIVER: I'm movin'! I'm movin'! ( indistinct shouting ) GREY: Stop! Catch him! Catch him! I'm gonna kill him! FIREPLUG: Hurry up! Get him, will you? Get him! Get him! Get him! CHIEF: Riley! ( indistinct ) FIREPLUG: Hop in! Hop in! GREY: Follow that man! Follow that car! I'm going to be late for my wedding. I can't believe it. Well, tell 'em. Excuse me. Psst. I gotta be-- The Assistant Secretary will see you as soon as his schedule permits. I'm not crazy about that guy. ( squeal of tires ) I can hardly wait to twist his ass! You should've caught 'im before! Shut up! I'm callin' the shots here! Now, drive! Cooper! Yes. I have tried to keep your duties circumscribed, Cooper! Sir-- AIDE: Cooper, don't interrupt when the Secretary's speaking. You have an inexhaustible supply of new ways to be found wanting. I understand that crockery, 12-inch dinner plates, property of the United States Government, and numerous other forms of our national condiments, were used in an impromptu game of football by your charges! SAM: Mister Secretary, they were upset! Evidently! Sir, those folks are so thoroughly ignored by everyone that it makes them... well, it makes them a little crazy. Those folks, as you so quaintly put it, represent countries whose collective budgets couldn't even cover the cost of replacing the dinner plates, or peanut barrels! And I'm not ignoring them. I have given them you. Your job is to see that they limit their hostile acts to diplomatic notes, or self mutilation! If you cannot do so, there is always Post 361. ( mouths ): Three sixty-one? In Greenland. ( Sam sighs ) All right, now, on to the next disaster. Facing Amanda. That won't be so tough. Come on. ( bridesmaids giggle ) You look stunning, Mandy. I wish Uncle Joe were here to give you away. He's our only family left. How can you count on a senile old scientist, who's always trying to save the world with his chemistry set? And where's Mister Samuel Cooper? Judy, go down and check again, would you, please? All he had to do was travel a few miles across town, and not get lost. He's doing this just to embarrass me! Sam wouldn't do that, Mandy. It's probably just something out of his control. Sam's whole life is out of his control. Listen, this is your last chance, you wanna change your mind? Are you crazy? A girl like Amanda? She's great. I don't know. This is it. ( squeal of tires ) ( screams and yells ) Come on, pick up speed, will ya? What the hell you want from me, shut up! Oh, wait a minute, I almost forgot. The Ambassador of Hong Kong, Ambassador Chang gave me these. TED: What's this? They're ah, pills for the wedding night. I know this stuff. This is for hemorrhoids. Pardon? Go on, drive! I want him dead! I want that bastard dead, go on! Ted, can you hurry up, please? I'm goin' as fast as I can. All right. I'm sorry, Just relax. I don't wanna get you mad, but I'd like to get there on time. RILEY: ( yells ) Look out, buddy! That guy's in one big hurry. Ah, watch it! Watch it! Watch it! Serves ya right, asshole! ( shouting ) Anything broken, Sam? I'm fine. I'm fine. Are you all right? TED: Yeah, I'm fine, come on. SAM: Should we pay for this? TED: No, the Navy'll take care of it, don't worry about this. SAM: Of course. Of course. I don't have my wallet on me, or I'd pay you something. Boris! BORIS: Theodore. Yes. Samuel, Samuel! Why are you smashing streets on your wedding day? SAM: I gotta get to my wedding, I'm late! Get in! Get in! It's locked! Boris Potemkin will deliver you... Well, unlock it! This is terrific! Unlock the door! I do not believe this. Open, he can't open the door. Let's go! It's his own car he can't open the door! I've got a wedding to... It's fine! Who's gonna pay for that? The Navy. Good thing you came along, Boris. ( Boris grunts ) I like your car. Well, I, I, I, I drive this product of capitalist decadence only to remind myself, daily, how miserable I am in your corrupt city. ( Russian theme playing ) Fortunately, I can still listen to the wonderful songs of the Russian peasants, with my Kenwood 240-B amplifier. With 24 R.M.S. watts per channel. And matching quadraphonics that will absolutely blow you up. TED: Blow you out. Blow you out. Eh, retractable roof. Stolen from cosmonauts. More power to the people! ( Russian theme playing ) Samuel. Yeah. Good luck, little brother. All right. See ya inside. I'll find space. They have valet parking. I'll find space. ( murmurs of bridesmaids ) Not to worry, my dear. I'm sure he'll be here shortly. I remember waiting over nine hours for a groom one time. Now, there was a worried bride. Actually, I'm not sure that he showed up at all. ( crash ) Honey, I'm sorry, I'm late... oh, my! Amanda, you look beautiful. Honey, I'm sorry I'm late! The ministers starting throwing plates. The Secretary threatened to send me to Greenland! And Ted rammed a pile of petunias. Oh, in that order? Hon-- Cindy, you look very nice. Honey, I'm, I'm, ah not exactly sure of the order, but ah... Hi ya, Reverend. Ah... ( laughter ) Were you surprised, it's from my heart. Don't worry, Amanda, I'll have him back in ten minutes, clean as a whistle! Start the music, Reverend. You know, it's her mother's dress. Yeah, right. ( indistinct ) Valentine's Day today? What the hell's he doing? ( speaks in foreign language ) Hey. Where've you guys been? Don't ask. Ah, Don, find a men's shop and get a new shirt. You'll find the size inside. Hey, you look nice. Milo, I'm gonna have to go and get this cleaned. Ah, make sure he stays put. Where am I gonna go in my underwear? I saw Amanda, she's got a dress, you know, it was her mother's... My shoes... they're in the bride's, they're in the bride's... you know where it is? It's down the hall. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The Bridal Suite. It's down the hall. Lots of girls there, you'll recognize it. Holy smokes! ( sigh ) Okay. Fish balls and chicken guts. Oh. Amanda. Go to Greenland. I do. Oh, Peter, you know, I forgot my lighter in my tux, too. I was-- RILEY: Are you alone? What? RILEY: Are you alone? Yeah, I'm alone. RILEY: Expecting anybody? No. I'm not expecting anybody. RILEY: Oh, I think I broke my ankle comin' up the fire escape. Oh, God. You guys are a little late for a bachelor party, don't you think? RILEY: It's not funny. Lock the other door. All right. All right, I'll-- RILEY: I'm not kidding! Lock it! ( Sam groans ) Come on! ( moans ): Ah, okay. All right, don't, don't, just don't hit me. Just don't, just don't hit me. RILEY: Lock it! Come on, move! Holy... what the... RILEY: Lock that door, right now! Lock it! All right. All right. Where are ya? Get the other door! I'll get you, Riley! RILEY: Get outta my way! ( Fireplug grunts ) No, guns! Think I'm a moron? Where is he? GREY: Look! On the bed! There! There, Riley! RILEY: Aah! Oh, my ankle. The chair! ( shouts ): Shut up! ( Pug Face groans ) RILEY: Beat it, punk! ( Riley grunting ) The window! ( breaking glass ) Ow! RILEY: Enjoy the view. RILEY: Hey, Bush Face, over here. That's it, over here. Here I am. Squaw Man! Come on! Come and get me. Aw, come on, fellas, you can find me. Come on, over here. Way to go, Grey. Oh, look around! FIREPLUG: By the door! By the door! ( Grey growls ) ( Riley groans ) ( Grey shouts ) Oh, my God! ( Pug Face yells ) ( evil laugh ) ( Riley groaning ) GREY: Look at 'im! He deserves this! ( groans ) Traitor! ( grunting ) Where is it? Where is it? Goddamn you, Riley! USHER: Sam? ( door shaking ) Sam? ( pounding ) I got your shoes. He must've hidden it in the car. It's the only other place. ( pounding ) USHER: Sam? ( pounding ) Open the door, Sam. Come on! USHER: Sam, are you in there? Are you all right, Sam? I'm gonna go find Ted. ( groans ): Oh, my God! ( Riley moans ) Don't move. Look, don't move. I'll get a doctor. ( door rattles ) TED: Sam! Open up, old buddy. It's your best man, Sam, and I'm waiting. RILEY: There's no time. Look under the sofa. TED: Sam! What's going on in there? RILEY: Get... ( moans ) ( pounding on door ) TED: This is not funny, Sam. Amanda's on her way, and she's upset. Runkelman-- SAM: Huh? Get it to Runkelman. AMANDA: Samuel, open this door immediately! ( knocking ) Did you hear me? I said, immediately! Sam, are you all right? ( labored speech ): I, I can't stand it. Take the knives out. TED: Sam, what the hell are you doin' in there? RILEY ( whispers ): Please, take them out. AMANDA: Samuel, I've had enough of this. TED: Sam, this is no time to chicken out! ( moans/dying gasps ): Take it out. AMANDA: Sam, are you all right? TED: Sam... The police are down the hall. Sam, there's a man standing here with a badge and a gun. He's not laughing. AMANDA: First he's an hour late, and now he's acting like a mad man. RILEY: Take the other one. TED: Sam, open up! POLICEMAN: Open the door, right now! AMANDA: Samuel, I'm waiting out here. ( knocking ) Runkelman. POLICEMAN: Open this door! I'm comin' in! ( pounding ) AMANDA: What is wrong with him? POLICEMAN: This is your last chance! Open this door! ( door kicked off hinges ) AMANDA: Where is he? ( screams and gasps ) No! No! Tell 'em what happened. BRIDESMAID: He's nude! Don't shoot! MAN: He's armed! ( gunshot ) TED: Sam, wait! Don't run! ( door opens and shuts ) CINDY: Don't shoot! USHER: Sam, give up! ( maid hums ) Where is he? ( maid speaks in foreign language ) ( prays ): Please. ( dramatic theme playing ) Where is he? Call headquarters and get some men down here to seal off the hotel! Check all the rooms on this floor. I gotta find him before these trigger-happy lunatics turn him into Swiss cheese. I think the ceremony is going to be delayed, my dear. Perhaps you should serve dinner to your guests. They're probably quite hungry by now. And we can perform the ceremony afterwards. ( knocking ) I'm canceling the ceremony. I trust you're not canceling dinner as well. ( knocking ) Excuse me, do you work here? No. Ya know, this is a service elevator, employees only. What is that, a 40 regular? No, it's a 38. Phone for you. What? Hello? Look, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Are there any other exits on this level? CLERK: No, no, none, none. How about the garage? Take out. The garage? CLERK: Yes, two. Here and here. ( sirens ) What's the matter? N-n-nothing. Nothing's the matter. Ah, excuse me. What the hell is this? What does he think? Does he think-- OLDER MAN: I don't know. ( chain rattles ) ( Grey breathes heavy ) PUG FACE: ...let Riley coldcock me, man. ( coughs and breathes heavy ) TEN DUYCK ( loud whisper ): Did you get it? Ah, no, Mister Ten Duyck. We, ah, we searched Riley's car, his clothes. He must've dropped it along the way. TEN DUYCK ( loud whisper ): Tell me, Carter, do you think it likely that Riley would have dropped it... after risking his life to get it? Ah, no, sir. TEN DUYCK: Then, he must have given it to someone. No, no, he couldn't have. We were right behind him every step of the way. He didn't have a chance. Riley was dead when we left him! He couldn't have given it to him! TEN DUYCK: Klieg, was he dead when you left? He looked dead. Yes. TEN DUYCK ( loud whisper ): You didn't make sure? We couldn't. The police were about to come through the door. We had to get outta there. ( loud whisper ): I see. Well, gentlemen... ( loud whisper ) this is more serious than I thought. A lot more serious. Klieg... Yes, Mister Ten Duyck. TEN DUYCK ( loud whisper ): Find Cooper! Find him before the police do! And hope he doesn't realize what he has in his possession! Yes, sir! TEN DUYCK ( loud whisper ): Now! Yes, sir! TEN DUYCK ( loud whisper ): Not you, Carter! I have another job for you! PUG FACE: Carter's finished. That's it. FIREPLUG: So what? ( Grey screaming ) ( dull thud ) ( Pug Face laughs ) FIREPLUG: Cops! ( whistle ) ( running footsteps ) BLACK OFFICER: Aw, man! What the hell? ( dog barks ) ( door opens ) Sorry, Sam, she's not going to see you. She won't even open her bedroom door to talk to me! Ooh, she'd never believe it anyway. ( groans ) Let's see this head. Oh! Thanks for the first aid. You're welcome. Oh, that stings. Hey, why don't you give me a try? I'll believe you. Okay. As I was saying... there was this... metal sphere. This sphere in mid-air. And a voice. Just a voice. And it said, "I've broken my ankle." And then it said, "Lock the other door." And then... just as I was about to lock it, the door popped open... and the next thing I knew, I was lying on the floor beside a naked man with two knives in his back. And that was all? No! No, no, that... no. Except... for this. Just before he died, he told me, "Get it... to Runkelman". Who's Runkelman? I wish I knew. I don't even know what that is. Except I think that somebody got killed over it. Wow. Hmm. There's no smell. Let's see what it does to the table. It's not acid. ( windchimes ) Don't touch it! Cindy, a man got killed over this stuff! I'd like to find out what it is! It's kind of slippery. I don't like this. Let's get it analyzed. Yeah, looks like we'll have to. Wait a minute, I'll have to. You're not gettin' involved. Oh, I plan to get very involved. Oh, ya know, you're very cute. I'll send ya hourly reports, okay? ( door slams ) She must be pretty pissed. ( dogs bark ) CINDY: Sam! SAM: Yeah. You're very pale! I'm very pale. You'd be pale too, if the entire Washington, D.C. police department was out looking for you, wouldn't you? Not that pale! Where is my hand? Where's my other hand? Wherever the rest of you went! What the heck. What's happening to me? Am I all gone! You seem to be. I, I can feel you! I, I just can't see you. Ah, this is great, just great! What if I don't come back? That other man came back. Oh, yeah, sure he did, two seconds before he died! Check it out! ( soft laugh ): You asshole. ( car door shuts ) ( footsteps ) You punk faggot! At least the police will have a hard time finding you. Holy cow! Looking like this, anybody would have a hard time finding me. I can go anywhere. The Treasury. The Pentagon. I can march right into the Oval Office. No wonder that poor guy in the hotel was killed for this stuff. Yeah. Sam! Who are those guys? They're, they're the ones who broke into my hotel room! ( whistles ): Cooper! CINDY: What are you doing? I got an idea, just get in the house. I can't help from the house. I'm staying right here. SAM: Don't argue with me, Cindy. I don't want you to get hurt. They're not going to do anything out here in the open. SAM: Just get inside! Now! I said get in! Move it! Hand over the container, Cooper! That's all we want. Before things get a little messy around here. Messy. Diplomatic douche. Hey, ah, can we talk about this, guys? Maybe we can make a little deal. Let's get 'im before he peels those clothes off! PUG FACE: The invisible wimp. You guys are pushin' your lick. FIREPLUG: Make a deal. Oh, Cindy... get in the house! Sam, run! SAM: I'm running, I'm running! ( gunshots ) Gonna kill you, Cooper! I'm gonna shoot those hearts off your ass! PUG FACE: Get around him. Well, get outta my way, you... FIREPLUG: ( indistinct ) Get 'im! Get up! Get up! Get off me! FIREPLUG: ( indistinct ) SAM: Naw, that's the wrong size. FIREPLUG: What, are you blind? ( gunshots ) Hurry. SAM: I'm hurrying! I'm hurrying! Hey, this is really a blast. CINDY: Well, I'm glad you think so. Hang on! SAM: Wait! Stop the car! CINDY: What? What is it? ( squeal of brakes ) SAM: This'll fix those cretins. Here. CINDY: I can't believe you, Sam. FIREPLUG: The tires! Bust 'em! Bust 'em! PUG FACE: ( indistinct ) SAM: Mwah! Was that a kiss? SAM: Well, it was sort of a brotherly peck on the cheek. Well, it's a start. SAM: What'd you say? Nothing. ( mellow theme playing ) SAM: Nice school. Lots of girls. CINDY: Right. SAM: Well, if I'm like the guy in the hotel, I'll be comin' back. So, I'll need some clothes. CINDY: I know. I can go out and buy you some. SAM: Great. GIRLS: Hi, Miss Worth. CINDY: Good morning, girls. You can wait in my office until I get back. Sam? ( footsteps ) SAM: Hi. Oops! Windy day, huh? What's your major? Sam! ( footsteps ) SAM: Stepped on a sharp rock, that's all. I'll bet! ( school bell rings ) You're not only barefooted, you're stark naked, in the middle of a girl's school! So, behave yourself! SAM: One kiss on the cheek, and you act like we've been married 40 years. Aah. Okay, what are your sizes? SAM: Okay, let's see, ah, 15 collar, 32 sleeve, 45 waist... ( Cindy laughs softly ) ...thirty-one. Thirty-one. You stay here! SAM: Hey, I'm rooted like a tree. Oh, Cindy, gimme the sphere. Thanks. Okay, well, you might as well make yourself comfortable. There's cold drinks in the 'fridge there, right behind you. SAM: Oh, good. Thank you. ( Cindy laughs softly ) Bye. SAM: Bye. I won't be long. SAM: Take your time, and hurry back. ( Cindy laughs ) SAM: Hmmm. Runkelman. ( dialing mobile phone ) SAM: Janet, this is Sam. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know the police are lookin' for me. That's why I need to find the addresses of everyone named Runkelman, Runkelman, who lives in the Washington area. All right, I'll call you. Thanks, Janet. Oh, shit! She's gonna kill me. I gotta find somethin' to clean this up. Well, maybe in here. She has to have something. Well, a towel or some-- ( showers running ) Holy Toledo, Cooper, you've died and gone to heaven. Oh, my God, lots of suds! ( moaning ) Easy, easy. Keep your cool. Keep your cool. Oop. Well, as long as I'm here... help a little. Thank you. SAM: You're welcome. ( screams ) Oh, my God! SAM: Oh. ( screams ) Now, now girls. There's... nothing to be upset, ah-- Miss Worth, there's someone in here! It's just your imagination, Terry. I'm sure that there's no one in here. SAM: Hey! ( slap ) Ow! What was that? Oh, my God! Justice. SAM: What are you doin' slappin' me like that? I only came here to clean somethin' up. I was doin' it for you. A grown man peeping at little girls! Terrible! You know, I can't believe that you did that! You put my job in jeopardy. SAM: Cindy, would you just look at the papers? You don't understand. You should be sorry for what you've done. SAM: I am. I truly am. I am, I'm very, very, very sorry. CINDY: ( laughs ) You look it. Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, little girl. I've seen 'em before, you know. Seen what? Bare feet. ( laughs ): Precocious. Thank you. ( Cindy laughs ) Cindy, you're not coming and that's final. I told you, I don't want you involved. Sam, I already am involved. Those thugs saw me drive you away. Well, we'll have to get you outta town. Look, did I save your ass or not? ( sighs ): You did. All right, then, I've got rights. Tough lady. You bet. All right. Okay, we'll start by going through the nine Runkelmans listed as living in Washington. ( panel hits seat back ) I suppose it is my fault. If I hadn't driven you and Ted to the hotel, you would never have become involved. So... do you have it with you? I'm not that dumb, Boris. BORIS: No, no, of course not. Well, it doesn't matter. Your people will get it out of you. And if they can't, they'll turn you over to my people. And, my people will get it out of you. ( car horn ) I-I-I'm sorry, I was nervous. What do you mean, "my people", Boris? I'll let them explain that to you. So, ( sniff, sigh ) we will take my car, please. Hmm? Look, Boris, ah... Cindy has nothing to do with this. Has she taken any of it? No. No. But you have? SAM: Yes. BORIS: That is too bad. That is too bad. Look, Boris, just let her go! It's highly unprofessional. But I suppose friendship must count for something. Yeah. This never happened, young lady. For your own sake. None of it. I understand. Take this, please. I don't want to litter. Move your body forward, please. Samuel. Samuel! Come, Samuel. Come, Samuel. Come along. ( Russian music on car stereo ) I don't understand. Why should our State Department cooperate with yours? If the United States has the formula and the Russians have the formula, then what good is it to either? But neither of us wants to have it. We want to destroy it! It's destabilizing. It's destabilizing? You see, the world is divided in half, hmm? You control your half, we control ours. Everyone is very happy. But if some third country should get hold of this formula, the entire balance would be upset. In the Kremlin, my associates are turning white at the prospect of a hundred million invisible Chinese marching into Minsk. That's destabilizing. It is very destabilizing. But Boris, the thing that... ( Russian music on car stereo )
