♪ Oh, I've been weary and getting tired, oh Lord ♪ On April 28, 2017, a North Carolina Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans unveiled a massive confederate flag along I-95 in Cumberland County. This highway is a well traveled corridor bringing people south towards beach communities from North Carolina to Florida. People of all color travel this highway on their way to vacations and a break from their working lives. This flag is a symbol of Southern pride for some and a symbol of hate for others. ♪ It's dark now and I'm on my way ♪ I know this highway well, I've traveled it many times on my way to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to attend two motorcycle festivals surrounding Memorial Day weekend. These festivals are known as White Bike Week and Black Bike Week, although anyone that's been there, knows it's not that simple. But my parents traveled it before me in a previous era, in a time of segregation. When they went to Atlantic beach, "The Black Pearl", the only beach that blacks could enjoy the sun and sand. There was another prominent sign along I-95 that my parents would've passed. I've often wondered how seeing that sign made them feel. Were they scared? Did they laugh at it? Or did they drive by in silence trying to ignore the quiet hatred directed towards them? In 2008, you could be forgiven for hoping that the post-racial era was beginning, that maybe this country would finally begin to unify under the idea that all people are created equal, 230 years after our founders wrote it down. ♪ Surely Jesus love, ♪ Well, you got me now ♪ Look down, Lord, look down ♪ But if you've attended Black Bike Week, you knew better. And now this is 2017, this is the South, and racism ain't going nowhere. Our law enforcement was stellar. We had more than enough people, 273 we sent from the state. In 2014, three people were shot and killed over Memorial Day weekend in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Five people were shot and three were pronounced dead last night. Now, Ocean Boulevard was shut down earlier for investigation. Captain David Knights confirmed a couple hours later that there was a shooting at Bermuda Sands Hotel on First Avenue, which is where I am live right now. And from what we know, three victims were found shot to death at this hotel, and another victim was taken to a local hospital and... These shootings took place on the Atlantic Beach Memorial Day Bike Festival, otherwise known as Black Bike Week. While subsequent investigations determined that the crime, its perpetrators, and its victims had little to do with the bike festival, city leaders and officials quickly denounced the festival as being to blame, calling for it to stop. It is time for that bike fest to come to an end and that is the way that I am going to talk to the elected officials of Atlantic Beach. And I think it's time that everybody in Horry County come together and say no more. For the small community of Atlantic Beach, where the festival originated, this was just another blow to its self esteem. Already impoverished by the economic forces of desegregation and financially ignored by the festival it created, Atlantic Beach continues to decline. The state can make sure that we let the people of Atlantic Beach know we will help them in every way to strengthen their community. But we are not going to promote any events going forward that do any harm to the citizens of South Carolina, and that's exactly what happened. So, it is now time for us to ask the elected officials of Atlantic Beach to come forward, let's come up with a game plan that works well for that community. But let's make sure that what is happening in Atlantic Beach is truly a reflection of South Carolina as a whole. A white person performs in a certain way as a young man, it's considered indiscretions of youth. You let the same black man get on a motorcycle, do the same things and it's considered thuggish behavior. If you look at the acts, a lot of them are much the same. If you look at the perception of the acts, it's very, very, very different. What's happening in Myrtle Beach every year is racist. But the forces surrounding Atlantic Beach, Myrtle Beach, Black Bike Week and the Harley Davidson Bike Festival that immediately comes the week before, runs much deeper. They're rooted in the South's larger history of racial tension and discrimination. There was a time when it wasn't always this way, a time when Atlantic Beach was known as "The Black Pearl", a time when black people from all over the South, including my parents, came here to relax, have fun, and enjoy the ocean. This was a time of segregation. People used to come, my parents and everybody used to come and that was the hub of nightlife or the life of this beach, the heart of this beach is right over there. Atlantic Beach was founded in 1934 by a gentleman, George Tyson. He took it upon himself to purchase this 94.6 acres of property here in order for people of color so we could have a place to come enjoy this great big ocean. Atlantic Beach was a destination for people of color, regardless where you came from. The entertainers, they could entertain in all the Ocean Forest Hotel, back during that time were like the Hilton or the Waldorf Astoria was back during that era of time. And they could play there but they had to sleep and eat in Atlantic Beach. My mom and dad was in the restaurant and motel business there and I met people way back during the '50s, like Lloyd Price, James Brown, Marvin Gaye, and Tammi Terrell and a lot of the entertainers that came here to entertain at the white clubs there. But they had to eat and live in Atlantic Beach. And it was a blessing for me and my family because my mom and dad, and anybody that had a business in Atlantic Beach, and what we would do, or what they would do, you had to stay open, keep your place open until the white places closed because the entertainers, when they got finished playing, they came back to Atlantic Beach to eat and they had the hotel rooms here. They were good enough to play the music but they weren't good enough to lay in those beds, so they had to come down here and stay. And that's why my father built this building because they would always tell him, say, "Hey, you know, we don't wanna play for them. "If we can't stay with them, we don't wanna play for them. "So, you build us a place to play here, "we'll play here and we'll stay here." So, my father built that place, and sure enough, it took off, that's what it was. Probably any big name entertainer that came through here played at Evans Colosseum in Atlantic Beach because that's actually what it was. I've always felt a special kinship to this place, something draws me here every year. I don't know, is it because my parents met here back in the '50s. People say, "Hey, my parents could've made me down here, "I could've been conceived in one of these hotels." But I love this place and it doesn't look like much right now but back in the day, this was the spot. This is the heart of this beach right here and this community. It was so sacred to us, as a people of color. This is our Black Pearl, and that's what I think. That had a lot of meaning to it other than just a word, Black Pearl. I came back to the area in 1968 and it was booming. It boomed all the way good, '68, '69, '72, even up into the early '80s. I remember growing up as a child, that this was the only place you could come or were welcomed if you were African American and you visited the grand strand. It was barricaded on both sides to create a separate town from North Myrtle Beach and other cities here on the Grand Strand. You were here in Atlantic Beach, if you were African American, you weren't allowed anywhere else. They had the signs posted, whites only, no blacks allowed. And you would think that goes way back but actually, I finished high school here in '75 and blacks and whites didn't even start going to school together until '72. Integration was good in a lot of areas, but it took a toll on us. When people found out they could go other places, they left. The other businesses that weren't as well-kept and weren't as well-equipped. You can't blame people for getting what they can for the money worth there. Today, people of all color can enjoy the same beach, the same sand, and the same water. Two generations removed from segregation almost brings back a nostalgic notion of our racially divided history. The sense that then is somehow better than now. There's no more cable to separate the white beach from the black beach. The physical divisions are gone, but somehow, standing on the edge of the ocean in the middle of the Atlantic Beach section of the Grand Strand, you can still see the ghost of our segregated past. The club was founded in 1980. That's how it originally started, was from three people, George Livingston, Joe Hemingway, and Socks. No Socks is what they called him, but we ended up just taking the No off and just saying Socks. They got the other bikers throughout the community that had a little club of their own, they just got together and rode around 20 miles, 30 miles on a Sunday, going from place to place, making a circle like Atlantic Beach, Myrtle Beach, Conway, Loris, Longs, and back here. And so, all of them got together and talked. So, they formed up a club and they called it the Carolina Knight Riders. And then we started having events on Atlantic Beach. And when we stared having our Memorial Day events on Atlantic Beach, each year just started growing larger and larger. We started inviting all these other motorcycle clubs to come to Atlantic Beach and celebrate Memorial Day weekend with us here in Atlantic Beach. During the '70s when there was a transition from segregation, a lot of our business started to go to the communities that they weren't welcomed in at one time. So, we saw a decline in business from that. So, that's why we put together the bike fest and came up with the bike fest to get something started, to get people back to this community. There was so many people that you couldn't, we never knew actual count of how many it was. But it just grew so big. I had one of the original letters that I got from different motorcycle clubs that said, "We're gonna come this year." I think we had something like about 47 different motorcycle groups coming here. I don't know what you've heard, but that's how it got started and that's why it got started. See, Harley actually started in North Myrtle Beach back in the '50s. And they would come from North Myrtle Beach, and actually, the police would lead them, and they would come down through Myrtle Beach and go out to 501 to the racetrack. We didn't get an influx of the Harleys here until that generation changed, and that was when you got into the yuppie generation type thing and it became the chic thing, to own a Harley. And that's how Harley grew. The Harley is an older group of people that come to Myrtle Beach and the surrounding area, the early 30s to 70. So, that's a big difference. There's a friend of mine who has a hotel said that he has a group of Harley people that come down every year. They would get up in the mornings, ride to eat breakfast, ride around some during the day, get back late in the afternoon. Go get dinner, and then sit around the pool and drink beer the rest of the night. They're starting to age out a lot, and so it's gonna be interesting to see what happens down the road with the youth in the Harley, because Harleys are not cheap. Spring break is gonna be smaller this year than past years. I think this is bigger than ever. I think Harley Week is coming back. I think at this point in time, based on the last couple years, and I'm down there every year, I've seen the crowds get bigger and bigger and bigger. And the Black Biker Week is a young group, I'd say early 30's would be the oldest. They sleep in the daytime and play at night. Age is the big difference. We're here to get drunk, fuck women, and stay out of jail. Myrtle Beach should've been something better, it should've been something more honest. The secrets of our past get carried into our current situation and so much of our life becomes an iceberg. And it's not only cultural, but it's almost like a virus. There are two events in Myrtle Beach. For far too long, these events have been separate and unequal. One event is welcomed and one event was not welcomed. When black bikers came to town, they were arrested for minor infractions. And there was a two-to-one arrest disparity between Harley Week and Black Bike Week. People were arrested for very minor things. We're not going to arrest somebody just for a misdemeanor-type dumb thing, okay? If we're gonna arrest somebody, then they're gonna be a problem. If you wanna commit a crime in the state of South Carolina, this is the weekend. You wanna rob a bank in Charlotte, take your ass and rob that bank, you will not get caught. Every police in the state, they're right here. On Saturday night, we were walking down Ocean Boulevard, the main drag in Myrtle Beach, when we came across a young man being arrested for an unknown reason. While he was clearly agitated, he was not violent. The question in Myrtle Beach on Saturday night during Bike Week is: how many cops does it take to arrest one black man? The nonsense is hurting our brand and it's hurting our brand image. Myrtle Beach's brand has taken a beating over the last three or four years. And the chamber says it's working. Guys, it ain't working. Honestly, from a grown-ass man, I feel like it's necessary. You know, I live in a good neighborhood, I still got an alarm on the house. If you out here acting a fool, you're gonna get a ticket or go to jail. That's all you, you put yourself in that predicament. I'm not gonna lie, back in my day, I've been to jail in Myrtle Beach, but guess what? I was doing stupid shit. As people who are carrying patches and colors to be responsible, to take care of yourself and not say the bad people were mean to me. Protect yourselves. Make sure your paperwork is in order, make sure your motorcycle's in order. Don't give them an excuse to harass you. The 700 police that are put down for Atlantic Bike Week, that is a pretty big allocation of resources for the state. Well, I have SLED here during that week, had like 20 agents from them, I also had Highway Patrol here during that week also. It will probably be 118 officers here in Atlantic Beach throughout that time. Generally during the year, how many officers are in this force? Just me and two other officers. I think that law enforcement presence needs to be there, just like it is during Harley Week. And it's an upgraded law enforcement presence for Harley Week, but I don't know that you necessarily need that many officers. At least I haven't seen anything that suggests that many officers are necessary. But we gotta just preach it to the right choir. You know what I'm saying? We gotta take our votes, we gotta look in further than just the presidential election and look into our local elections. See who we putting in position that's gonna be controlling these certain decisions that's made. And get into figuring out how we can go deeper than the police department. We can't win fighting the police department, and we don't need to fight the police department because on the flip hand, we need them. Daytona was almost lost in 1998 when the government became very heavy handed. But they stopped. They have not stopped at the Memorial Beach Rally. I just really enjoy the atmosphere in Daytona much more than Myrtle Beach in that wherever you are in Daytona, it's welcome. You're welcome as a biker, you're not looked upon or frowned upon and it gives you the opportunity to ride a lot more. If the police officers are looking at you, they're telling you, "Nice bike. "Wow, can't believe a woman is riding that bike." But in Myrtle Beach, it's more of, "Let me make sure "your bike is registered, let me make sure you have "the proper insurance, let me make sure you can "even afford to ride the bike." There's a lot of these cops that's out here policing us, really not from our neck of the woods. They don't understand our culture, you know, they're quick on the trigger. So, we're gonna have to get our own community to come together to be able to make things happen. What's the worst thing you've ever seen out here? Too many police. Really, too many police. Traffic flow, public safety, crime deterrence. These are the phrases we hear over and over again as an excuse for the tenfold increase in police presence during Bike Week. "We're just trying to keep the streets safe," they say. But is this really what they're doing? According to John Rhodes, the Mayor of Myrtle Beach, the attendance for Harley week was: We would probably have a couple thousand to 3,000 bikers. Mayor Rhodes was talking about a time after the city had cracked down on noise and helmet laws. So, we asked him about Harley Fest at its peak a few years back. What were the numbers before then, before all this? Oh, 20 to 30,000. Okay, that's what I thought. Yes. So, according to the Mayor of Myrtle Beach, Harley Fest attracts 30,000 bikers on a good year. What about the attendance for Atlantic Beach Bike Week? What about Black Bike Week? What kind of numbers are you expecting for that? 300-plus thousand. Out of the best year for both festivals, you can expect 10 times as many visitors to the greater Myrtle Beach area during the Atlantic Beach Memorial Day Bike Fest, Black Bike Week, as you would during Harley Fest the week before. You would think that there are 10 times as many police during Bike Week as Harley Fest, and 10 times as many people. You would actually get 10 times as many arrests, 10 times as many traffic tickets, and at least 10 times as many accidents. According to police records in 2014, the year the shootings that prompted Governor Haley to call for an end to that Bike Festival, there were 53 arrests made during Harley Fest. You would assume there would be around 530 arrests during Bike Week, but police statistics show that during that period in 2014, How about traffic tickets in 2014 during Harley Week? And bike week? Traffic accidents. In fact, going back as far as 2006, the numbers for crime, arrests, traffic tickets, and accidents are remarkably consistent, and nowhere near 10 times as much from one weekend to the next. Could it be that the people that come to Bike Week are actually more law abiding and less prone to trouble than everyone wants to make it seem? And looking at these numbers, what would be the cause for anyone to think that Bike Week is less safe or more prone to crime? And what could possibly be the excuse for the governor to call for it to come to an end? Well, one thing about South Carolina that we know, it's one of the few colonies where the African American enslaved population exceeded the white, slave-owning, and enprivileged populations. So, South Carolina, historically, was always a very antagonistic colony because the black population exceeded the white. When freedom came following the 13th Amendment and the Civil War, there was a deliberate attempt to not only control black people in South Carolina, but to reduce their numbers. And we find that that controlling was even more intense in South Carolina because of the numerical majority that black people held over white folk for some time there. These battles that we fought over the years, both righteously and unjustly, these are spiritual battles. All of these battles have been spiritual. Is Myrtle Beach racist? Absolutely. It's holding onto an era that's passed. The whole systems are set up, the institutions are set up to protect a few people. South Carolina is always and probably will always be a pivotal state. As we know, the Confederate flag was just removed and it took the murder of nine Africans in order for them to finally take that flag down. You see, so we see that strong, white supremist and racist mindset within that particular state. White power. They took down that Confederate flag, but the Confederate mind state is still embedded in the minds of a lot of these police officers and government officials. The battle that we're looking at, black versus white, black week, white week, it will implode upon itself just like slavery did. And 150 years from now, our children's children's children will be amazed that we're having this conversation. Just like we're amazed at the conversations that people justified for slavery 150, 200 years ago. You're worried about that 23-mile loop, aren't you? A little bit. I don't see why. Why would you not want safety? Now, the traffic pattern was created to keep traffic moving along Ocean Boulevard, both pedestrian and vehicular traffic. If you turn down 29th Avenue and you go to Ocean Boulevard, you're in this traffic pattern now. You know, one of the main problems that we have with this traffic pattern is it doesn't serve its purpose of facilitating flow of traffic. They say that it was designed to address the crime problem of violence that occurred a few years ago, but there's no rational relationship between a traffic pattern and the prevention of violent crime. They don't impose this traffic pattern when there's violence any other time of the year. It's a part of a long pattern of discrimination against African Americans that come to that city. Traffic along Ocean Boulevard is one-way only southbound. There is no getting off of that Ocean Boulevard. You know, they got these road blocks, they segregate us into one little area and they have us in traffic all day long, you know, just getting searched. They don't try to hide the fact that they don't want Black Bike Week happening in Myrtle Beach. So, the traffic loop is bullshit. I came Harley Week, when all the white people were here, and it was a totally different experience. We could go down either side of the highway. Ocean Boulevard all weekend long, for 24 hours, everyday, starting Friday morning until Monday, will be operating in a southbound direction only. But we think that the city has gone backwards with this traffic pattern. It's kind of unorthodox to change the entire traffic pattern for an event. I'm not aware of any other event that they do that for throughout the year. I know that that particular traffic pattern has also been a point of contention in the federal courts and it's been challenged a couple times. And it's been strucken down and it's been altered over the years and tweaked. We want to continue to police the same way and be consistent, Memorial weekend, the way we do at Sun Fun Weekend, Country Music Fest, every other weekend throughout. It's like prison, you know what I'm saying. You know what it is, man. You try to keep the damn animals in here, know what I'm saying. They're like animals, they can treat us like animals. 2017 now totally changed, man. It's like everything is just blocked. You can't even move around. We're still gonna come every year. The 23-mile loop's not stopping anybody. Everybody's still showing up, we're still coming out here, following the rules just like they ask, it's not doing nothing but making a big congestion and everybody that's doing vacation, that's not even doing the Bike Week, is getting mad, they can't get to their houses or their hotels on time. That may be a motivation behind this traffic pattern, to make the event so unpleasant that people no longer wanna come. I remember last year, I got caught in that traffic loop and I'm like, "I'm not coming down here no more." It's more of a like, like a maze, like a trap. You gotta run them through all these different roadblocks. If you get to 29th Avenue and you turn east and travel to Ocean Boulevard, you are in this traffic pattern. Ocean Boulevard, the traffic will make a right hand turn, travel down Ocean Boulevard to Kings Highway. The only option that you have is once you get up here to 501 and 31, that's where you can get out of the traffic pattern. Along 31, you're safe. You wanna stay with the traffic loop traffic, stay in the right hand lane. If they go around the loop, they can't. So, the 23-mile loop is not fair to anyone that is a patron of Black Bike Week, it is not fair to anyone that is coming to Myrtle Beach just to hang out on Memorial weekend. For years, the businesses would have "Welcome Biker" signs during Harley Week, the predominantly white event. They would welcome these bikers, they would treat them with courtesy and respect, but then the following week during Black Bike Week, they would close their doors to African Americans, refusing to serve African Americans. As some bikers came for both weeks, they saw the difference and the disparities in how people were being treated, so they started calling the NAACP. Some people filed lawsuits against hotels and businesses, and the NAACP got involved and we actually ended up winning some of those lawsuits. This is the climate that we're talking about. And then when they would actually serve African Americans, they would subject African Americans to second-class treatment by raising their prices, by limiting the menu, or even closing the interior of restaurants and forcing African Americans to eat outside. Reminiscent of the days of Jim Crow. That's the type of treatment that African Americans have endured there. Some of the things that the restaurant chain does to prepare for Black Bike Week is, for instance, plastic silverware on top of the regular silverware. Another thing they did was take the Ziosks off the table, the computerized handheld devices that are usually left at tables. And in this particular weekend, they would remove them. And then continue past Memorial Day, that following week, just to say that it wasn't just that weekend. A lot of the things that they did weren't surprising to me because, growing up here, I've seen a lot of different things that are quite similar, especially during this week. We just people. When you're out on that bike, you're a biker. Imagine explaining to your kids how is this fair. It's not fair but I can't tell them to do something. I can't tell them to be upset, it is what it is. I've been to the Harley Davidson Rally, and really enjoy going. It's much more freedom to ride, they don't have the inconvenience of the loop, the businesses are more open. Although trying to sleep at night, they was spinning the wheels... Until 5:00 in the morning. When you get a crowd and you get tourists, and you get money in a city, you're gonna get crime. It's just the fact that if you're gonna do one bike week that way, do all bike weeks that way. So, we've received a lot of complaints about people being arrested for minor offenses, such as revving their engine on their motorcycles. We've received complaints about people having their motorcycles confiscated without justification. So, what we have is a situation where they are aggressively enforcing the law and a situation where people are being arrested for very minor violations of law. And it's just creating an environment that's really hostile, an environment where people are discouraged from coming back to Myrtle Beach. To make Ocean Boulevard a two-lane, a two-way road, the way it is every other week of the year, is not only fair, but to me, it makes good business sense. It's so silly that they would put so much stress into getting rid of a group of people who are the number one consumers in America, when all Myrtle Beach is geared around selling things. Black Bike Week was our best fucking money making week, bro. Too bad the fucking mayor fucked it all up. We are not particularly motivated to create anything that benefits us collectively. See, the neglect is for the collective, not for the individual. So, the average African American looks out for their own best interest. So, the brothers and sisters who come down to Myrtle Beach to party, they're looking out for their own best interest. They're not looking long-term, they're not visionary, they're not saying to themselves, "Listen, ya'll, this started over here in Atlantic Beach "in the first place." We don't receive any funds as the founders. We don't even, um, I don't know who we would have to go to or talk to, or anything, but nobody has offered anything like that. Everything that we do out here, we do on our own. Carolina Knight Riders being the founding club of Bike Week really should take more of the forefront and lead more of that and bring more of the history back to them. So, the people who are coming here, don't even understand why they're coming here, not even paying homage to the people who they should be paying homage to. We should go down to Atlantic Beach and hang out, party from one patio to the next, you know, walk the streets, dance, and have fun, meet people from other states, other places, because there would be busloads of people down there. You had the ferris wheels and everything else right there, amusement park, you had everything right there. You cannot compare Atlantic Beach to Cracker Barrel or Olive Garden, or Longhorn Steakhouse. It is an entity unto itself, and we need to make that effort to support it so that we can have a viable piece of our heritage involved with Bike Week, because there would be no Bike Week without Atlantic Beach. And believe me well, if there's no Atlantic Beach, sooner or later there will be no Bike Week. We just don't understand that they're intrinsically linked to each other. I would like to see it opened up to, or evolved, to something that everybody can go to. As it stands now, it looks worse than a third-world country and you're not gonna draw any type of tourism into such a place. History of why Atlantic Beach was started is hindering them from going completely forward. I think they have some great ideas, but I think, going forward, that history of being segregated and separate has continued on until this day. Every year it dies more and more. I honestly don't know how long it can exist the way it is. I've never looked at their tax revenue, their ins and outs, but there is nothing going on economically to support it. It's done, I think after this year it's done. I think they should, in the 10 years I've been coming here, you had major players in the game that knew each other. Like if you was from Memphis, or this one, that one, you know you all click-clack at a common ground, a location. I ain't seen none of them dudes. Every person I seen was young and coming up riders or people that was in the area. But long distance, I ain't really seen too much of it. The worst could happen if people would stop coming, stop supporting it. That would be the worst, I never wanna see that. Slavery did three things to us that we still suffer from today, all Africans in America suffer from this. Number one, slavery made us comfortable having no control, no power or authority over our reality. You come into a black community, we don't control the politicians, we don't control the businesses, we don't control the churches, we don't control the vote, we don't control the dollar, we control nothing. Now, contrast that with Chinatown, contrast that with Little Italy, contrast that with a predominantly Latino community, contrast that with a European Jewish community. Okay? They control all of the systems and institutions in their communities, we control none of them. And we're comfortable with it. It's not just we don't have the control, we're comfortable having no control, so that's number one. The second thing, slavery destroyed our commitment to the collective. Black people are the most individualistic people in America. We wake up thinking about nobody but the people under our roof. As far as what's in the best interest of the black community, it is the second thought, if it is to be a thought at all. There's no collective cohesion, slavery stripped it. And the third thing that slavery did is it took away the guilt and shame that people naturally feel when their behavior works against the best interest of their people. There's a natural shame and a guilt that comes from people who love their group, who love their culture, love their community. When I engage in any behavior that does not benefit this community, there's a shame that I feel. African Americans have no shame whatsoever for consistently doing things, engaging in behaviors that are detrimental to the collective. What happens to the group is irrelevant. I'm only concerned with what happens to me. ♪ And ashamed that you need a friend ♪ ♪ Someone to share the load ♪ And when the sky is a little cloudy ♪ ♪ I can see the rain falling down on you ♪ ♪ I'll be a shelter in the time of the storm ♪ ♪ I'll see you through ♪ That's what I'll do ♪ I'll be a shelter in the time of the storm ♪ ♪ I'll see you through, that's what I'll do ♪ ♪ He told mama I fry everything fresh now. 10 with the fries. Well, there's a solution to their problem and then there's a Ba-A aid. The Band-Aid is to try to force the businesses down in Myrtle Beach to actually invest some of the money that we spend with them back into the black community. That's a Band-Aid strategy. It maybe successful to some extent, but it's not a solution. It's not a solution because why do we have to beg white people to reinvest money back into the black community when all we had to do was not invest it in them in the first place. For me, the solution would be for African Americans to divest from Myrtle Beach. Take that festival back to Atlantic Beach and build up Atlantic Beach as an independent hub for black activity, entertainment, so forth and so on. That's the solution. But let me tell you, you haven't experienced such love, such passion in one bag. Find it, buy it, taste it, and you, too, will love Joe's Gourmet Fish Fry. Add me another tombo! It's a great event and I've been doing it for over 15 years, actually. I've seen bikers with their family, with their kids. I've seen some of their kids raised, they're still eating the fish too. Although I can't comment on White Beach. Oh, boy, but Black Beach! It's Atlantic Beach Bike Festival. It's never been Black Bike Week, or any of those names. And, of course, the media gets that and runs with it. Of course, surrounding cities in the Grand Strand may say that, different entities on social media might say that, but the correct name of the festival and what we advertise is Atlantic Beach Bike Fest. Sometimes we work for the perfect deal, and sometimes what will be best is if we settle for the best deal possible. There are big developers that would come in and develop Atlantic Beach tomorrow. Oceanfront property, and then you'd have the black community staying in their hotels there. But what I see going on with city management in Atlantic Beach will kill the one beauty of the event, the actual traditional place where the event's supposed to be, that strip. I see a very dim future for it. And of course, we're not overlooking development. We want some developers to come in. We want a nice resort hotels and some nice restaurants, and a few things, and we're on the right track to getting that done. - And we do something for Atlantic... - on Beach, I think we could do something big, definitely. We don't want to get away from our culture and our heritage. They just want to hold onto the past and, you know, and the history that's here, and I understand that. They don't want the big skyscrapers like you see back there. They want smaller buildings as an ode to the past. A lot of time, if you don't ask for something, you don't get nothing. So, that's what the category I put that in. First of all, this is a world, a realistic world. You have to let people know at some given time that what your wishes are. They offered to help us here in Atlantic Beach but under those conditions, under the conditions that we do away with Bike Fest. And until we do away with Bike Fest, as far as the state helping us in any kind of way, they're not. Since we bring all these people to town and all this revenue that other places are generating out of our, not our event because people go the way they want to, out of that event. It could be talking about anywhere. I don't know if anything would come of it or not, I don't know. We are a town or a city in South Carolina, just like any other city or town in South Carolina. If you wanna help us, help us, but don't give us conditions that you'll help us. We will help you if. Why can't you just help us? Myrtle Beach should thank Atlantic Beach for all the revenue that they're making for one weekend versus what they make throughout the whole year. It's weird. It's weird how we war against factions that we don't understand sometimes. There are people who actually and truly don't want to see other people supposedly get ahead of them. I have this inclusion model that says, I don't have a problem if you make a million dollars if I make money, I don't really understand some of the warring things that happen when you start talking about money. Financially astute African Americans will not have a financial agenda that is necessarily in the best interests of working-class African Americans in Atlantic Beach. I'm not a big fan of bringing outside black investors unless they have a conscious commitment to improving the condition of their people. Not just by what they say but by what they do. Show me on paper how the black community's gonna be better served for having you come in here versus someone of another color. We need a lot of work done, lots of work done. And remember, unfortunately, Atlantic Beach has to recycle the same people over and over again. Unless we get some new blood coming to town, some new blood with new idea. But that's gonna take some financial accountability. And one thing about us as a people, we are a very unaccountable group of folk. We're the only ethnic group in America that doesn't have any financial accountability to the collective. That's what it's gonna take to do that. You're gonna have to build and not just depend on other folks. Right now everything is made for us. The hotels are there, the businesses are there, the restaurants is there, the amenities are there. And despite the treatment, despite the treatment, we will still go anyway because we're more interested in depending on the structures that white folk and others have already created as opposed to building our own. It's a psychological thing. We're the ones who are gonna have to fix that. Nothing is gonna change in Myrtle Beach until we change ourselves. We don't understand how it was four or five years ago. Oh man, it was so ridiculous. You might turn around, there'd be a woman on her head twerking on the top of a truck while it's moving. They don't understand the skill that that take for it to be moving and her on her head twerking. I kid you not, and I still go the footage, man. It used to be so epic four or five years. It's still cool right now, but boy, four or five years ago, like a movie. Hangoverone, two, three, and four! Most of us are so caught up in the past of some stupid small story, or caught up in the stigma of things that we believed that are not true, that we can't move into something that is really universally true and will universally unite us and will universally transform us. I don't see it going away at all. I've seen this event survive ridiculous helmet laws that superseded state law. I've seen ridiculous traffic patterns set up to deter us, harsh treatment from both property owners and police, and over the years, that didn't really kill the event. It could use some tweaking. I mean, there's a lot of things that could probably make it a lot better, you know. Add some more activities for, maybe, smaller kids during the daytime, and things like that, and we certainly need other events other than just Bike Weekend. The future of the event is pretty unknown. We've gotta identify who's running this city. Once we identify who's running this city and they're willing to come to the table, and we can make a difference and they can make it a win-win situation where we're not out here being harassed by the police. There's only one way to find out is by getting to the table with them. What they're doing is not right, as far as the blockade, and they gonna take it down. I feel like it will come down. I think the event is a great event. The Harley Davidsons, the Indians, the BMWs, all of the major manufacturers, I wanna see them understand this is a national event. This is not just a group of people getting together for a weekend. And if they wanna build their industry back, this event has to become a part of it. Bike life, this is forever. Bikes ain't gonna go nowhere, riders ain't gonna go nowhere, and I think this is something that is gonna be with us forever. I don't think it's going anywhere. It's always gonna be here, just like Harley Week. The future is it's definitely not going anywhere. It's not going anywhere because the city of Atlantic Beach welcomes it and supports it, and this is where it started. So, whether Myrtle Beach or North Myrtle Beach supports it or goes against it or not, I think it's gonna live on forever as long as the city of Atlantic Beach welcomes us. We've got a live concert out here. We've got the strip. I mean, it could be a lot to be improved, but I won't take away from what's already going on, you know what I mean? Once we can prove to them that this is a good, safe, and vibrant community, I think Atlantic Beach is gonna take off in the future and really develop. We all get along, we pump a lot of money into the community and I think it's a good deal all around. And if they embrace that, it'd be a lot better. Myrtle Beach has the best setup, as far as hotels, as far as open road, as far as ability of restaurants, and as far as fair prices, to be rally-friendly. I don't think that Myrtle Beach can end Black Bike Week but I think Black Bike Weekers can really harm Myrtle Beach's brand. I would be more concerned with what black bikers would do to the name Myrtle Beach, in trashing the name, than I'd be concerned about them running off Black Bikers. Black Bikers understood it correctly. In the age of social media, they have more power than the city does. They've been talking boycott for years, it never happens. I mean, at the end of the day, we all love to come, we enjoy it. Some people have stopped coming that I know of, but for the main part, people still gonna come. The best way for it to move forward is unity. Everybody coming together. Keep coming, don't give up. United we stand, divided we fall. We don't wanna fall. So, we're here today to show some support and unity in this MC community, okay? So, let's stop the noise and show them love and support, like we here today, all right? All right, I love ya'll, so let's go into prayer. Some people say we should leave Myrtle Beach, put our kickstands up and head south to Daytona, or north to Jersey. If Myrtle Beach doesn't want us, why spend our money here? But what would that solve? They want us to leave, and so we leave. Everyone loses. And what about Atlantic Beach? What will become of the last historically segregated beach community in the country? Can Atlantic Beach survive without Bike Week? And could Bike Week ever be the same without Atlantic Beach? They can win this war against Black Bike Week with the barricades and the police state stuff, and the spying. But what happens to the name Myrtle Beach when all of that falls out? I'm here to tell you that it does exist here in Myrtle Beach, all year round, in particular, particularly, particularly this weekend, Memorial Day weekend. We're all citizens of this country, we have the right to go where we want to be. We have the right to be free from discrimination. Myrtle Beach is going to come to realize when this current crop of people who are just wrong-headed, they're gonna realize we can't do this heavy-handed stuff and maintain our brand image. We don't own the event, we don't promote the event. We just have to maintain the event. Would I like to see it shut down? I'd like to see it smaller. People that wanna come to Myrtle Beach, they have every right to come to Myrtle Beach and every right to demand that the city and the businesses treat them fairly and equally. This occurs during Memorial Day weekend, where we celebrate those who sacrificed their lives for freedom and democracy. That's what we're supposed to be celebrating. And it's just ironic that during that celebration of freedom and democracy, you have a city that treats its citizens and those who are visiting the city as second-class citizens. Imagine if Rosa Parks said, "Well, "they're not gonna treat me equally, so "I'm just gonna put up with it", or "I'm not gonna get on that bus." This is our back of the bus. This is our Howard Johnson's. This is our Woolworths. These are our diners. At some point, people have to stand up and demand equal rights and equal treatment. And that's what we're gonna continue to do. What my elder brothers and your parents, and your grandparents did, it's your turn because freedom has never been free. You have to fight for it.
