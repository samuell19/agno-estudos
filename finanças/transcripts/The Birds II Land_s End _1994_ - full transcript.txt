How far is it? JILL: Mom, can I sit up front? Scout's leaning on me. -JOANNA: How come I always get stuck in the back... -[SCOUT BARKING] -...like this, with Scout slobbering all over me? JILL: You do not. [EVERYONE SINGING] ♪ There were two girls Who had a dog ♪ ♪ And Scout was his name-oh ♪ S-C-O-U-T, S-C-O-U-T ♪ S-C-O-U-T ♪ And Scout was his name-oh JOANNA: Stop it, you idiot. Come on, Jill, don't tease your sister. I can't believe you picked this place. I mean, nobody even lives out here. That's the whole idea. That's right! We're gonna get away from it all, this summer. I'd rather be at home with my friends. Well, you know what, I bet when your friends hear about your island adventures, they're gonna be really jealous. When are we gonna get there? This oughta be it about right... ...here. Yep. JILL: This is it? This house looks gross. JOANNA: It looks like nobody's lived here for years. I can't believe you'd pick this place. MAY: You'll play with each other, silly. JILL: She's a little geek. -JOANNA: You're the geek! -MAY: We're here! You guys grab your backpacks. [SCOUT BARKING] JILL: Mom, they have a swing-set! MAY: Oh, great! That'll come in handy. [CHUCKLES] JOANNA: Come on, Scout. Come play with us. JILL: Cool. -JOANNA: Don't push... -MAY: Girls, come here. Let's check out the inside. Come on! Hey, Jill, look they've got some checkers there on that table. JILL: I'm gonna go find the TV. -MAY: No running on the stairs! -JILL: Okay! -Well? -[GIRLS INDISTINCTLY CHATTING] What? It's nice. It's... [MAY CHUCKLES DRYLY] It's nice. TED: Wow. Man, I can look at the ocean while I work. Yeah, which will probably just distract you, keep you from getting anything done. What? How can you say that? It'll be an inspiration. I can't believe it. There isn't a single TV in this whole stupid house. Honey, we're on an island. Even if we had a TV, we wouldn't be able to get reception with it. We could get a satellite dish. And videos! -[SEAGULLS SQUAWKING] -[SCOUT BARKING] TED: It won't kill you girls to go a few months without watching television. But then what are we gonna do all summer? Gee, let's see... How 'bout having a little fun? [MAKES TEASING NOISES] [SCOUT BARKING] JILL: What's wrong, Scout? JOANNA: Do you think they can see us? I don't know, honey. They're pretty far out. Hello!

MAY: Ted, come on. I don't want to be late. TED: I had to get Joanna her shoes. Girls, you need to come along. -JILL: I don't mind staying at home. -JOANNA: Me neither. Okay. I was gonna take you guys shopping with me and get us a little ice cream for later on, but if you don't wanna go, it's okay. Really. I understand. Can we get whatever we want? We'll see. We'll see. After all, it is a vacation. -JILL: I want cookies-n-cream. -TED: Right, girls? It's a vacation for them. We're supposed to be working, remember? JOANNA: Come on, Mom. Hurry up! [TEASINGLY] That's right. We're ready. We're waiting for you. Let's go. [SINISTER THEME MUSIC PLAYING] TED: I guess this is it, huh? TED: A little nervous, are we? -MAY: Sort of. -[TED CHUCKLING] MAY: Would you grab that file box? -TED: Yes, I will. -MAY: Thanks. JOANNA: Can we come in? MAY: Um, not on my first day. TED: Girls, why don't you stay here and wait for me, okay? -I'll see you tonight. -TED: I'm just gonna be a minute. JILL: Why can't we go in? JOANNA: Yeah. I wanna see where Mom works.

Nice to meet you. Uh, this is my husband Ted. -TED: How're you doing? Good to meet you. -FRANK: Hi. How are ya? Uh, here, let me take that. Um, let's see, where should I, uh...? Oh, uh, right over here. Right here with all the new computer equipment that you're gonna teach me how to use. [MAY CHUCKLING] Great. FRANK: Yeah. Well, hey, I'm a computer illiterate. I don't know my RAM from my ROM. -[MAY LAUGHING] -FRANK: A little joke. MAY: Well, I can help you with that. -FRANK: I hope so. -Wow. -Did you take all these? -Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to get around a bit. Of course! Francis Irving! [CHUCKLES] I've been looking at your stuff for years. How did a photographer like you end up in a place like this? -Ted-- -Oh, well, I couldn't pass up the opportunity, to pontificate on the op-head page on the great questions, should there be a traffic light on Main Street? [MAY LAUGHING] Well, it was a power grab. So, uh, you're a teacher, Fred? It's Ted. -Oh, I'm sorry. -That's all right. -Yeah. Biology. -College? Uh, no. High school. -High school biology? -Mm-hmm. I think that was my worst subject. Well, that's probably because you didn't have a very good teacher. Yeah. That must be it. Well, listen, I should let you two get to work. Hey, it was great to meet you. -Bye. -Okay. Um, I'll see you later tonight? -Okay. I'll call you. -TED: Okay. WOMAN: I'll call you when he comes in, Nadine. TED: What do you say, girls? You about ready? -Yep. -Can we get these and these? Why don't we just pick one, okay? TED: Is that what you want? -JOANNA: Yeah. -TED: Okay. -Hi. -Hello. You must be the folks out at the old Holman place, right? That's us. How'd you know who we were? Oh, well, uh, honey, I don't think there's many secrets on the island. Not many that get by me. There you go. Thank you. -This okay? -Yeah, sure. Wait a minute. There's one for you and one for you. Girls, what do you say? -BOTH GIRLS: Thank you. -You're welcome. Oh, they're lovely little girls. Any boys? Uh, no. Just, just the two girls. -[CASH REGISTER BEEPING] -It's a great place for kids. Well, it seems like a pretty nice place for grownups, too. Well, it's a little slower pace than we have over on the mainland, but... TED: Oh, that's true. Actually, that's... kinda why we came here, for a little peace and quiet. Well, nothing's going to bother you at Land's End. It's the quietest spot on the whole island. Just the wind and the surf and the birds. JOANNA: Daddy! Daddy! It's that boat we saw yesterday. Uh, I'll be right back. Excuse me. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] What's goin' on? HELEN: What happened? We don't know yet. She ran onto some rocks, up near South Point. Where's Gordy? GAME WARDEN: Your guess is as good as mine. Kevin saw him take her out yesterday, but there wasn't anybody in this boat when we found 'em. [EERIE THEME PLAYING] [GIRLS LAUGHING] [BIRDS SQUAWKING] [SCOUT BARKING] -Girls. -BOTH GIRLS: Yeah? Come on. Time to get ready for dinner. JILL: Come on, Scout! Come on in and get washed up. Scout? He'll figure out it's dinner time, soon enough. Come on. JILL: I wonder what he's barking at? [SCOUT CONTINUES BARKING IN THE DISTANCE] [SIZZLING] -Ow! -Be careful. I think I overcooked it. -Can I go look for Scout? -No, honey. Just let him play. He'll come in when he's hungry. -Excuse me. -Go look for your sister, though, -'cause we're gonna eat now. -Okay. So how was your day? TED: Oh, not bad. You get much done? Enough. How 'bout yours? How's Mr. Action Adventure doing? [MAY CHUCKLES] Everything's fine. In fact, Frank says I'm a lifesaver. [SARCASTICALLY] Yeah, I bet he does. -Who wants to say grace? -I will. -[SCOUT WHIMPERING] -JILL: Scout! TED: Oh, man! What has he got in his mouth? -JILL: Ew! It's a dead bird. -[MAY SCOFFS] TED: Scout, put it down. Drop it! -[BIRD CHIRPING FRANTICALLY] -JOANNA: It's still alive. Don't touch it, Joanna, you just washed your hands. I got it. Go get me something I can put him in. -Don't hurt him, Daddy. -I'm not gonna hurt him. Here. This will make it softer, like a nest. There you go, little fellah. TED: I think he's gonna be all right. Can we keep him? He's a wild bird, girls. He's not really like a pet. Please! I'll take really good care of him. -MAY: We'll see. -Mom... Your father and I'll talk about it after dinner. Come on, let's eat. [BIRD CHIRPING] [TED EXHALES] [SCOUT CHOMPING] -MAY: Oh, no! -TED: Scout! [EVERYONE SCOLDING SCOUT] TED AND JOANNA: Bad dog! [SEAGULLS SQUAWKING] JILL: Dad. Can we go take our bikes and go exploring? Okay. Just don't go too far. -Okay. -TED: Jill, you're in charge. -JILL: Okay. -But that's not fair! She'll boss me around! Well, if she does that, maybe tomorrow I'll put you in charge and you can boss her around. How would that be? Okay! Tomorrow I get to boss you... -Be careful. -[SCOUT BARKING] JOANNA: That's what Dad said. [MELANCHOLY THEME PLAYING] [DRAMATIC THEME PLAYING] [EXHALES HEAVILY] [SEAGULLS SQUAWKING] JILL: I can beat you if I wanted to. -JOANNA: Hurry up, slowpoke! -[BIKE BELL RINGS] [SCOUT BARKING] [GROANS IN PAIN] [GIRLS LAUGHING] JILL: Dad, what're you doing on the ground? Oh, I thought I'd just take a break. Look at all the money I found. JILL: It's not money, dummy. -It's sand dollars. -Scout! Scout! Want a dollar? Girls, please. Scout, come on. -Come on, Scout. Scout, come on. -Get him outta here. -JILL: Come on. -JOANNA: I'm richer than you. -JILL: It's not real money. -JOANNA: Yes, it is! [GRUNTS] -MAY: Oh, this countryside! -[CAR HORN BLARING] It reminds me of the south of France. FRANK: When were you in France? MAY: Ted and I back-packed through Europe, right outta college. God, that seems so long ago. [CAR APPROACHING] Hey. MAY: What, uh, what happened? Oh, I was... just doing a little painting. Works better if you use a brush. [ALL CHUCKLE] So, uh, you want me to swing by, -pick you up tomorrow morning? -MAY: Sure-- That's okay. I'll...I'll take her. Okay. See you there. -Thanks for the ride, Frank. -FRANK: See you tomorrow. I thought you were gonna start writing today. [CAR DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] -Well, I thought I'd just... -[CAR ENGINE STARTS, DEPARTS] ...you know, take a little time and work on the house. [CAR RECEDING] The house is fine. I thought we had a deal. I'd take a job in a nice peaceful spot for the summer and... you'd work on your thesis. You know, we are supposed to be relaxing... on this trip. What did you do to your head? A seagull ran into me. A seagull? Yes, a seagull. You don't believe me, do you? You should have a doctor look at this. Do you believe me? Yeah, sure. [MARINE BELLS RINGING IN DISTANCE] -TED: Hi. -Oh, hi. -Is Dr. Rayburn in? -You a patient? No. I had a little accident yesterday and... Yeah. Well, if you want to see him now, he's over in his other office. His other office? Didn't you know he was also the mayor? [RAVEN CAWING] [UPBEAT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] [BILLIARD BALLS CRACKING] What can I get for you? Uh, they told me I could find Dr. Rayburn here. RAYBURN: I'm Rayburn. Why don't you come on down here and step into my office, huh? -[RAYBURN CHUCKLES] -Thanks. Now, is this visit civic, medical, or is it purely social? Well, I thought maybe you could take a look at... at this right here. Ooh, that's pretty nasty. What the hell did you do to yourself? I didn't do anything. It was a sea-- Well, I guess it was a seagull. Where? Where did this happen? -We live out at Land's End. -Oh, sure. Yeah. Helen told me about you. You're the guy with the kids? Right. In fact, that's what I'm mostly concerned about. Does this kind of thing happen often around here? Often? Hell, I've never heard of a bird attacking people in my life. Wait a minute, I can't be the only one this has ever happened to. Hey, Jesse! Birds been giving you any trouble lately? Nope. Me and most birds get along just fine. [RAYBURN CHUCKLING] There have been a lot more gulls around, lately. I mean, you get out there, a few miles from shore, and the sky's thick with 'em. JESSE: What's wrong with that? I thought where there's birds, there's fish. Then how come I've been coming back half-empty the last few days? Well, maybe... it's because you've been going out half tanked! [JESSE LAUGHING] Will you put that thing away? Oh! You moved! MAY: What are you doing? I'm just finishing off a roll of black and white. Well, you know what, you're just wasting your film. Oh, no way! You should see yourself in this backlight. [CAMERA CONTINUES CLICKING] You know what, if you don't start paying attention, you're never gonna learn how to do this. Now, who says that I'm not paying attention? Besides, it's almost lunch time and I just happen to know this great little place on the island for seafood. Oh, I thought we had a deadline. You know, May, you're a very attractive woman, and I get the feeling sometimes that your husband doesn't tell you that often enough. -Frank... -No, I'm serious. I mean, does he ever tell you how sometimes when he looks at you, you're so achingly beautiful his heart almost stops? Come on, Frank, don't tell me that this approach actually works for you? What? Are you kidding? I've never had to work this hard for a lunch date in my entire life. [LAUGHS] Actually, you know, I started out just pretending to be a photographer. Just so I could move around in places where I didn't belong. Rock concerts, Watts, Chicago in '68. Then I found out after that there were people who thought that I was actually pretty good with the camera, like the U.S. Army. Oh, they drafted my ass, sent it to Vietnam. Had me shooting the shooting. After the discharge, I moved on to Belfast, Middle East, Africa. Everywhere I went there were so many incredible images. And then it was the, um, early '70s, and I was kickin' around in Paris and that's where I met Emily. Who's Emily? My first wife. You gonna finish those crab-cakes? -No. No. I'm not. Here you go. -Thank you. [GIRLS LAUGHING] JOANNA: Look at all the new shells. JILL: Oh, this is a good place. JOANNA: Let's go look for some sand dollars. JILL: Ew! It's a dead bird. [BOTH GROANING IN DISGUST] Don't! Ew! It's all stiff! JOANNA: Don't touch it! -[TENSE THEME PLAYING] -[SCOUT BARKING] JOANNA: Oh, look! It's that man. JILL: Scout! Get away, Scout! Scout! [GIRLS SCREAMING] [SCOUT BARKING] [GIRLS SCREAMING] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] POLICEMAN: All right, now. [STRAINING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] FRANK: So what do you think, Doc? -How'd he die? -Must've drowned. -What about those marks all over his face? -Beats me. Fish could've nibbled at him or maybe an eel. -[POLICE SIREN WAILING] -What about birds? You tryin' to be funny? You mean to tell me you don't think those wounds look something like that? You saying birds attacked him? I don't see a gull doing anything like that. Do you think he did it? -[SCOUT BARKING] -[BIRDS CHIRPING, CAWING] [SCOUT WHIMPERING] [SCOUT BARKING] [BIRD SQUAWKING] All right, kiddo. Come on. Time to go to bed. -JOANNA: Good night, Egbert. -TED: That's my girl. [TED EXHALES] [MAKES ANIMAL NOISE] Could they help that man in the water? No, honey. There was nothing they could do for him. He was dead like Tommy. Did they take away Tommy's eyes too? No, honey. It was nothing like that. Why did Tommy have to die? I don't know, angel. I don't know. Now try and get some sleep, okay? JOANNA: Okay. TED: Okay... TED: Night-night. -MAY: Good night. -JOANNA: Good night. Well, they took that pretty well. Yeah, but it must have scared the hell out of them. At least we had a chance to talk to 'em about it. Want to talk about it with me? [EXHALES SHARPLY] It's hard for me too, I was his mother. And I miss him... [VOICE BREAKING] ...maybe even more than you sometimes. MAY: But that part of us is gone and we'll never get him back. [MEEKLY] I know that. Ted, he's with me in my heart. I've lost a son... but I'm not about to lose my husband, too. Listen to me. It's been a long time, Ted. It's affected your career, it's affected us. You gotta focus on who's here. We're here. Me. The girls. We need you. [MAY EXHALING SHARPLY] Come on, let's go to bed. TED: I'll be up in a while. [MELANCHOLY THEME PLAYING] [WOOD CREAKING] [SQUAWKING] [EERIE THEME PLAYING] [TED SHRIEKING] Jesus! -[GROANING IN PAIN] -[GLASS SHATTERS] Damn! [SQUAWKS] What happened? [SHORT GROAN] Another goddamn bird! Look! [GROANING IN PAIN] Son of a... [RAVEN CAWING] HELEN: They still don't know how Gordy got all cut up. BO: The medical examiner said there must've been rats on board. Got him after he died. The sheriff checked that boat stem-to-stern, didn't find nothing. HELEN: Maybe it wasn't rats. -BO: What was it then? -HELEN: Lord only knows. That'll be seventeen... BO: Can you put that on my tab, Helen? -HELEN: Okay, Bo. -BO: Thanks, Helen. Sorry about your friend. Oh, thanks. It's just so awful that your little girls had to be the one's to find him. Well, I think they'll be fine. Why don't you have them bring me in some shells and I'll trade them for some of those cookies they like. [CHUCKLES] You better watch out. You make a deal like that, it's gonna cost you plenty. What happened to your hand? Oh, I just cut it on some glass. [CLICKS TONGUE] Hasn't been a very good week for you, has it, Mr. Hocken? Doc Rayburn told me about your other little accident. [SARCASTICALLY] I'll bet he did. Well, never mind what he says, you and I both know there's something going on around here, don't we? We do? The birds. They're...acting funny. So, you've seen it? My nephew was hurt by one, just yesterday. Here on the island? No, not far from it. It happened when he was fishing off the shoals, south of the island. -Right down from us. -Yeah. Just a few miles off of Land's End. [SEAGULLS SQUAWKING] JOANNA: Last is worst, first is best! If you finish last, you gotta take off your dress. -JILL: I'm telling. -JOANNA: No, you're not! -JILL: Yes, I am. -JOANNA: No, you're not! JOANNA: What is it? A pirate house? JILL: No, it's a lighthouse. It shines a light at night so that ships won't run into the island. JOANNA: I wonder who lives there. MAN: I do. [GIRLS SCREAMING] -[SCOUT BARKING] -[BIRDS CHIRPING, CAWING] I'll bet it's lonely living in a lighthouse. I'd love to live in a lighthouse. But what if you were all by yourself? Well... I could always have Egbert with me and you could always come and visit. JILL: What are you doing? Birds don't eat French fries. How do you know? Are you a bird? No, and I'm also not a little geek like you. [SQUAWKS] -Egbert! -Catch him! -JOANNA: Egbert! Egbert! -JILL: Mom! Catch him! -JOANNA: Egbert! -JILL: Dad, catch him! Mom! JOANNA: Egbert! Daddy! MAY: What is it? What's wrong? JOANNA: He's down here, someplace! He got out of his cage and he got out of our room! Oh, honey, are you sure? Are you sure he's down here? -I don't see him-- -JOANNA: Yes! We both saw him! -JILL: Oh, no! -[SCOUT BARKING IN DISTANCE] [JOANNA WHIMPERING] Egbert, come back! JILL: He's gone. I wish we could've caught him. Well, the important thing to remember is that Egbert was well enough to fly away. That means you did a great job helping him get better. But why'd he go? I would have taken good care of him. TED: Well, we know you would've, sweetheart. Maybe he wanted to be with his family. Yeah. You wouldn't want to be separated from us, would you? -No. -See? TED: I don't know, maybe we shouldn't have let her keep the bird in the first place. MAY: Aw, she'll get over it. People do get over things. Everything's just so important at that age. I remember when I was eight, my goldfish Lucy died... and when Dad flushed her down the toilet, heh, I just felt like it was the end of the world. I did! [BOAT BLARING IN DISTANCE] [MAY MOANING SOFTLY] [RAVEN CROAKING] [MOANING CONTINUES] What brought this on? I don't know, maybe the salt air. [RAVENS CROAKING] [DRAMATIC THEME PLAYING] [BARKING] What is it, Scout? -Ted-- -Shh. I think he heard something. What is it, boy? [MAY SIGHS] Look, if I'm bothering the two of you, I can just go inside. [MAY SCOFFS] [CLOCK TICKING] Brilliant. Brilliant. Dad, can you go bike riding with us now? Maybe later, sweetheart. I'm working. But you promised. JOANNA: Come on, Dad! [SEAGULLS SQUAWKING] JOANNA: Wait for me! TED: Come on, slowpoke! -JILL: I'm winning! -TED: Catch up. Catch up. -I'll race you. Go! -JOANNA: Hey! Not fair! Oh, you're gaining on me! [EERIE THEME PLAYING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [PHONE RINGING OUT] [SIGHS] -[PHONE RINGING] -JILL: Phone's ringing, Dad. Look out, Scout! -I'm coming. I'm coming. -[RINGING STOPS] [SIGHS] Great. Great. He was supposed to be working. He promised. Well, if he can take an unscheduled break, I guess you can't complain if I, uh... buy you a beer before you head home. FRANK: Come on, what do you say? [SCOFFS] Sure. Why not? FRANK: So, why Gull Island -and why this summer? -[MAY CHUCKLES] -[CASH REGISTER RINGS] -[BILLIARD BALLS CLACKING] Let's see, I thought that, you know, a summer on the island, family being together, Ted working on his thesis... Ah! Except that he isn't. No, he's not. -He's stuck... -[LIQUID POURING] ...and I don't know if I can help him. Actually, he probably doesn't want my help. He got offered this really great job, two years ago at a city college. -All he had to do was finish up his degree. -BARTENDER: Here you go. Yeah? What is wrong with this guy? He's got a beautiful wife, two great kids, -a man's best friend. -[GLASSES CLINK] I'll drink to that. [CASH REGISTER RINGS] Five years ago, our son Tommy died, and Ted's having a really tough time getting through it. -I'm sorry. -MAY: Thanks. And I don't blame him. I don't either. Just after a while... I realized, hey, life does go on, and he just wants to be exactly the way it was and it can't. Well, maybe he's got to go in a different direction. And maybe you gotta go in a different direction, too. You know, if you knew you were gonna be late, you could've called me. -MAY: I did. -TED: About five? Yeah, and no one was home. Yeah, I know. I called you right back and nobody answered. That's 'cause Frank and I went for a drink. -Did you start dinner? -JILL: Excuse me. No, it's your turn tonight, don't you remember? [GIRLS CHATTERING IN DISTANCE] Would it be such a big deal for you to take the load off me now and then? What, so you can spend more time with Frank? -[SIGHS] -[KNOCK ON DOOR] I'll get it. I'll get it! [SIGHS] -It's him! -My luck was good tonight. This is too big for one old man. You could feed a whole family with a fish like this. It's very fresh. Nice color. I cleaned it up for you. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Thank you. Oh, Karl. Karl Melber. Ah, my name's Ted Hocken. Good to meet you. Um, would you like to come in and join us? Help us eat it? KARL: Well, I hadn't brought it for that. Ah, I know, but... Actually, it'd go quite well with frozen peas. [SCOFFS] -So, of course, a pirate... -[TEA KETTLE WHISTLING] ...either dies at sea or at the end of a rope. -So what happened to her? Did she get hung too? -JOANNA: Yeah? Anne Bonnie was captured, -but she disappeared from her dungeon... -[WHISTLE STOPS] just like that... and was never seen again, and neither was her treasure, but people are still looking for it here-- digging around, ruining our dunes and wetlands. Okay, you little pirates, I think it's time to climb into your PJ's and get ready for bed. Can't we hear just one more story? There'll be more stories some other time. Come on, now. Let's go. Say goodnight. [KISSES] Goodnight. Thank you for the stories. My pleasure. Get over here! Where you goin'? -Goodnight. -JOANNA: Goodnight. -Night-night. -JILL: Night. Don't forget to brush your teeth and say your prayers. -I'll be up in a minute. -BOTH GIRLS: All right. I take it you're quite an expert on the island. Are you interested... as a biologist? Oh, I'm not a biologist. But you are a teacher. There are no secrets on this little island. TED: Oh, really what I was hoping is... I thought maybe you might have an idea about what's going on around here with all these birds. There are many more of them right now... More than I've ever seen before. You see, Ted, for us, this is the edge of the earth. Land's End, they call it. But the birds, they just fly on... The land belongs to us, the world belongs to them. Kind of you to share your family with me. Nice girls. [SQUAWKS] [SQUAWKING] [MAY LAUGHING] A little slower... -FRANK: There we go. -MAY: There it is. -Now, let it slide... -[FRANK CHUCKLES] -MAY: Wait. Slower. -Wow, it bounced. -Good. -How's that? Okay. Just use a little-- a lighter touch. A lighter touch? Well, easy for you to say. Wait, here. Like this. Look. Relax your hand. Good. Now, select text, click. Oh, I'm good at that. Good, that's right... Okay, here, let's try and move this... [COMPUTER BEEPS] [SIGHS] I'm sorry. I thought, uh... I thought that's what you wanted. I don't know, I... Oh, I don't know. [EERIE THEME PLAYING] [TAPPING ON GLASS] What are you doing? Look! It's Egbert. He's back! -[SQUAWKING] -He really missed us! That's why he came home! Dad! JILL: Mom! [BOTH SCREAMING] What--? Oh, my God! -Ted! -TED: Get back, Scout! [ALL CLAMORING] -Get the girls out! -I can't! I can't! I can't move! [MAY SCREAMING] Oh! Oh! Get 'em off! -Ted! -[TED GRUNTING] [WHIMPERS; BARKING] [MAY SCREAMS] [ALL CLAMORING] -Come on, girls! -[GIRLS SCREAMING] [TED GRUNTING] MAY: Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Come here. Let me see you. -[BIRDS SHRIEKING] -Get out! Shoo! [GROANING] [PANTING] [HAMMERING] Why did they do that to us? I don't know, honey. I think maybe they got lost. I think it was because they were mad at Egbert and they knew that we were his friends. Yeah, maybe that was it. Jill, I want you to take Joanna inside and play a game of cards or something for a while, okay? I don't mind helping. Honey, that would be helping. -Fine. -Thanks, Jill. JOANNA: Are they gonna come back tonight, Jill? JILL: No. They won't come back. TED: May? You ever seen a bird like that before? I don't think so. Why? Is there something special about it? Well, I just-- I've just never come across one like it, that's all. Yeah, well, we're not from around here. [TELEPHONE RINGING] I know that. I don't think this little guy is either... Mom! Telephone. It's Frank! Here. [BOAT HORN BLARING IN DISTANCE] Well, couldn't you come in for a couple of hours? I can't, Frank. I really can't. Well, I'm stuck in the damn tutorial here. MAY: Um... Okay. go through the, um, manuals that I gave you. You don't need me for that. FRANK: Is this about yesterday? No. Yesterday has nothing to do with it. Um, it-- We just had a problem here last night, and, uh-- I can't go into it right now, Frank. -FRANK: May...? -Yeah, look, um, I have to go now. [SCOFFS] What's goin' on out there? I'll call you tomorrow. I'll try to come in tomorrow. -FRANK: You'll try to? -Yeah. Thanks. Bye-bye. So, what did he want? He just wondered why, um, I wasn't in there today. Well, you really should go in if it's important to you. I thought you wanted me here. Not if you don't want to be. Jesus... You had some visitors last night. It was loads of fun around here. -Are the girls all right? -Well, they were pretty shaken up last night, but I think they're gonna be okay, yeah. I'm glad to hear that. -I'm not intruding, am I? -No! No! No! No! Of course not. In fact, maybe... you can help me answer some questions here. Maybe we can help each other. Curious thing is happening with the birds around this point of the island. South Point. Marsh lands. And now here, Land's End. Helen told me about an attack on a fishing boat... here. Here, off the shoals. Yeah. That fits. You wouldn't happen to know what type of bird that is, would you? KARL: It's a black-napped tern. This is the first time I ever heard of one showing up anywhere near here. -You're kidding. -Wait... Look at this guy. I picked him out yesterday, out of the wetlands at South Point. It's all covered in oil. So what you're saying is that the oil killed him. You are the biology teacher, I was hoping you could tell me. I had a hard time identifying it. According to the book... this is commonly known as brown hooded gull. If it's so common, why was it hard to identify? I'm not following you. It's common only if you live on the coast of Brazil. [LAUGHING] I take it "His Honor" is in? That depends on what for. For starters, this island and everybody on it's in danger. Heh. What kind of danger are we talking about here, gentlemen? This wouldn't have something to do with birds now, would it? Yes, it does, but this time-- RAYBURN: Hey, just look around you, sonny. How do you think people around here make a living? Fishing. And the occasional tourist, that's how. Now, if you go around tellin' 'em that the birds are dangerous, and that their fishing grounds are contaminated and their beaches are polluted, well, hell, we might as well just close up for the rest of the season right now. Mister, you don't understand, you've got a problem here. The only problem that I see here is some mainlander tryin' to stir it up, that's all. Well, I got two daughters, one nine and one eleven, and last night, they were attacked by birds. Hundreds of them. Now, I don't think you want to be responsible if something like this happens to somebody else's kids. Did you put him up to this? I didn't have to, he could see for himself. Then he's as crazy as you are, old man. -You just can't ignore this? -Well, I don't know. -That sounds like a pretty good idea to me... -[BOTH CHUCKLE DERISIVELY] If you're not gonna do anything about it, then I am. Well, you're just spinnin' your wheels, Hocken. We like to go through channels around here. Do things the right way. You mean your way? [CHUCKLES] You got it. Ah, come on. TED: Jesus Christ! You believe that guy? I told you, it wouldn't do any good. TED: How many people have to get hurt on this island before he'll do something about it? I guess this didn't turn out to be the best summer to come visit your island, huh? Life gives you opportunities, you either take them or...you walk away. You just give it your best shot. When I ran away from my country, I used to feel sorry for myself. It turned me into a real son-of-a-bitch. [DRY CHUCKLE] Ah, come on, Karl, you didn't end up so bad. I ended up alone. May? [CLOCK TICKING] Girls? Jill? Joanna? May, my God! What are you doing out here? Come on. We gotta get inside, it's almost dark. -It's not dark yet, Dad. -I was with them. Come on, Scout, you scared the hell out of me. -JILL: Come on, Scout, come on. -TED: Hurry. MAY: Come on! MAY: Come on, get in there. [DRAMATIC THEME PLAYING] -MAY: Ted... -[TED GROANS] You never came to bed last night. I had to keep the fire going. They could have come down the chimney. Come here. [WIND HOWLING] It's a beautiful day today... Not a bird in sight... We can't stay here, you know that. I know. I'll start packing today, that make you feel better? Hey, let's go for a swim before the girls wake up. Come on. -Come on! -[BOTH CHUCKLE] [MAY JOYFULLY SCREAMS] MAY: This is great! Hurry! Come in here! [MAY LAUGHS] Come on! Uh-huh. Ah, the water was great, you should've come in. TED: What is gotten into you? Heh. It must be the salt air. I guess I haven't been there for you, have I? Sorry I let you down. You've been there when it counts. They've been gathering south of the island, haven't they? When the tide rolled in last night, so did the birds. I could see them from the tower. Just waiting there. TED: Waiting? Waiting for what? Just gathering. Assembling. Waiting, like an army. You make it sound like it's gonna be war. It's not as if we haven't asked for one. You know, Mother Nature can take only so much before she hits back with all she's got. Did you know something like this happened before? When? Recently? Twenty-five, thirty years ago... Why haven't I heard the other islanders talk about it? Didn't happen here... Somewhere out on the west coast. TED: It happened in a little town in Northern California called Bodega Bay, about 30 years ago. They said the attack lasted a couple days. Well, if it only lasted a couple of days, don't you think we're past the worst of it? No, no I don't. There'll be a ferry here tomorrow at 10 o'clock-- I think we should be on it. [PIANO PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] [BIRDS SQUAWKING AND CHIRPING] [MUSIC STOPS] [BIRDS CONTINUE SQUAWKING] [DRAMATIC THEME PLAYING] Scout! Scout! [SCOUT BARKING] [BIRDS SQUAWKING] Come on, boy. Here, Scout... [SCOUT BARKING] Bad Dog. You were supposed to stay inside. [CLEARS THROAT] Yes? What're you doing? Where's your sister? I don't know. Last time I saw her she was outside looking for Scout. [BIRDS SQUAWKING] -Joanna? -Daddy? Walk to me slowly. But, Daddy, there are so many of them! Daddy, I'm scared. Walk to me very slowly, honey. May! [JOANNA SCREAMS] -JOANNA: Daddy! Daddy! -[SCOUT GROWLING] JOANNA: Get 'em, Scout! [SCREAMING] -TED: Hang on, honey! -MAY: No! -[SCOUT GROWLING] -[JOANNA SCREAMING] JOANNA: Scout! Scout! -TED: Get inside! -Hurry, Ted! -JILL: Come on! Hurry! -MAY: Hurry! TED: Get inside! [GROANING IN PAIN] TED: Get away from him! Leave him alone! [GRUNTS] Get off him! -TED: You'll be all right. -MAY: Spread it out for him. TED: Hurry up, sweetheart! Hurry up! MAY: Oh. Poor Scout. Oh. -Is he gonna be okay? -I don't know. We're gonna do everything we can for him. [BANGING ON DOOR] JILL: Mom, what's happening? JOANNA: Daddy! Dad-- -JILL: Dad! -[MAY SCREAMS] JILL: Mom! -MAY: Oh, my God! -[JILL SCREAMS] May, go call the sheriff. JOANNA: Jill, I'm scared! Jill! It's dead. [GIRLS SCREAM] -JOANNA: Mommy! Daddy! -It's okay. Go to Daddy! Dad! Daddy! -[GLASS SHATTERS] -Oh, my God! JILL: Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! JOANNA: Mama! Ted, do something! Please, do something! JILL: Dad! [RATTLING AND GLASS SHATTERING] JILL: Dad! JILL: Daddy! Daddy! Oh, God, Ted! -MAY: Oh, God. -[SQUAWKING CONTINUES] TED: Shh. Shh. Shh. TED: Listen, listen. They're leavin'. They're going away. [THUMPS] TED: It's going to be okay. [MAY TREMBLING] -[CLOCK CHIMING THE HOUR] -[JOANNA SCREAMS] It's all right. It's all right. -[MAY SIGHS] -It's all right, girls. [OMINOUS THEME PLAYING] Oh, my God! [KARL GROANING AND GASPING] Oh! Oh! [SCREAMS] [FOOD SIZZLING] -Yeah... -[PEOPLE CHATTERING] You've gotta get back to the office right away. -What for? -There are people there who need you. They're hurt! Don't tell me. They've tangled with some birds. TED: Scout, old friend, you've brought surprise and adventure into our everyday lives and you were a great source of joy for us all. Even though I said I never would, I forgive you for the two days you ran off after Joanna was born. You were a... food-thief and a... bed warmer without equal... We will all miss you. Lay the shell down. [TED SIGHS] Will Scout be with Tommy in Heaven? Of course he will, honey. I didn't even get to say goodbye. TED: Do it now, sweetheart. But it's not the same. I know it's not the same, but... sometimes it's... really what we should do when we lose someone that we love. [MELANCHOLY THEME PLAYING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] WOMAN: Watch out! [PEOPLE CLAMORING] -Oh! -[BIRD SQUAWKS] It's pretty weird, isn't it? When did it start? Just a few minutes ago. Isn't this the damndest thing you've ever seen? [SQUAWKING] [TED GRUNTING] TED: Try it again. [ENGINE STRUGGLING] All right. try it again... [ENGINE STRUGGLING] TED: Forget it. Forget it, honey. [TED SIGHS] We're not going anywhere in this thing. Goddamn it! Do you think they're gonna come back? [CAR DOORS OPEN] If they do, the house isn't gonna take another attack. Will the birds hurt me? Honey, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you or your sister, I promise. Look, what if we walked? No, it's too far. The ferry'll be here in less than two hours. Karl could help us! Yeah! All right. You kids go inside and wait. Go on in with them. [SUSPENSEFUL THEME PLAYING] [SQUAWKING] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] -[SQUAWKS] -[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] Karl? -[PEOPLE CHATTERING] -[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [GRUNTS] Frank! What happened? [TRUCK HORN HONKS] MAY: Okay, girls. Go, go! TED: Come on, girls! -[TED GRUNTS] -MAY: Where's Karl? -Karl can't come right now. -JOANNA: Why not? He's gotta stay and take care of his lighthouse. See, he's not afraid of birds! Get in, sweetheart. -[PEOPLE CLAMORING] -[BIRDS SQUAWKING] [CAR HORN BLARES] Can it fit this many cars? It doesn't matter, we're going to walk on. They'll be enough room. Come on, girls. -[BIRDS SQUAWKING] -[PEOPLE CLAMORING] [ALL GASP] Here. Stay here I'll be back in just a minute. Where are you going? I'm gonna talk to the mayor. Somebody's got to get in touch with the Coast Guard, tell 'em the lighthouse is out. What happened to the lighthouse? -What about-- Ah! -Easy. -What about Karl? -He didn't make it. Jesus, Frank, what happened to you? Birds didn't like gettin' their picture taken. Startin' to sink in now, Doc? You got a problem in this town with birds! Karl talked about the tides. It was a high tide when they hit us last night. It won't be long before it comes back in again. Doc... All those birds need is a little attitude adjustment! [BOAT HORN BLARING IN DISTANCE] Ferry's comin'. You people are crazy. -WOMAN: Stick together! -[BOAT HORN BLARING] MAN: Whoa. Whoa! It's okay. It's all right. RAYBURN: What do you say, Jessie, we get ourselves a few of these fine-feathered friends? Hey! Hey, you! You chicken-livered mainlanders. What's the matter with you? You afraid of a few little birds?! -[PEOPLE SCREAMING] -[BIRDS SQUAWKING] [DRAMATIC THEME PLAYING] [GUNSHOTS CONTINUE] TED: We gotta get outta here! Come on! Grab your stuff, girls. Come on, let's go! [MAN GROANS IN PAIN] TED: This way, girls. Ted, May, come on! Hurry! May, come on! [SCREAMING CONTINUES] -TED: Over here. -No, no, no. Not this way. I got a jon boat down at the end of the dock, you take it. -Go on. Go on. -Frank, what about you? Come on. Nah, I'm gonna stick around and try to get the best shot. -TED: Frank, come on! -Go, go! [SCREAMING] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [PEOPLE GASPING] -TED: Move, move, move! -MAY: Let's hurry. Hurry! Go to your dad. -JILL: Dad! -TED: Get in! [OMINOUS THEME PLAYING] Daddy, you said you wouldn't let them get me. I won't honey. Ted, what do we do? May, take the girls and get out of the boat. TED: I'm gonna tip the boat over. And when you come up, come up underneath the boat. JILL: What should I do? What should I do? MAY: You both hold onto my back. Get on my back. Hold on to me. JILL: What do I do now? MAY: Joanna, hang on, we're going under. Mama? Mama? JOANNA: Mama? Mama? -JOANNA: Mama? -Joanna! Dad! [BIRDS SQUAWKING] MAY: Oh, my God. My baby. Hang on. [THUMPING ON BOAT] -[SHUSHING] -TED: It's all right! It's all right. They won't get in here. We're safe in here. [GIRLS SCREAMING] -[THUMPING STOPS] -[WINGS FLUTTERING] They're going away. They're going away. [SQUAWKING FADES] It's okay, they're gone! Here, get up on the boat. MAY: Go on, Jill, pull. [TED GRUNTING] We're gonna be all right, girls. JILL: Look, they're all flying away. Where are they going, Daddy? They are headed for the mainland. [OMINOUS THEME PLAYING] [DRAMATIC THEME PLAYING]
