Subtitles by explosiveskull - Scarlet? - Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you this late. I'm looking for my child. He wandered off, and I think he's somewhere around the area. I'm sorry, I just got home. Would you mind helping me look? Nobody's answering their doors and I'm afraid something will happen to him. I really can't, I'm expecting someone any minute. I could really use another set of eyes, please. I'm sure there are other people home who could help you, I'm sorry. Can I at least give you a picture of him, just in case? Sure, but I'm terrible with faces, just slip it under the door. Isn't he beautiful? If you'd just keep an eye out for him, I'd really - appreciate it. - No problem, good luck. Hello? Hey. No, that's fine, that's fine, I'm still setting up and hey, when you get here, I have to show you this picture this woman gave me. She came looking for her kid. No, really, it's fine, just hurry up. Okay, love you too, bye. - Hello? - It's me again. - Any luck? - Unfortunately no. - Can I ask a favor of you? - What is it? Nobody else is answering their doors, I was wondering if you have a flashlight I could borrow. He'll know it's me if he sees it. I'm sorry, I don't think I have one. Please, nobody else will help us. You really need to ask someone else, I've told you I can't help you. He's only five years old, he's my only child, please, will you just look? I'll be right back. Rachel. Where are the others? Inside. This is really old, I can't guarantee it'll work. Thank you so much, sorry to bother you. Enjoy your dinner. Enjoy your dinner? Call Scarlet Jones? Hey, are you almost here? The woman came back again and I just feel weird. She said something kind of strange. Okay, just hurry up. Okay. Okay. I never left these open. Leave right now or I'm calling the police. Please, he needs help. Get away from my door. You can't leave us out here. Can't you see he needs help, please? Open the door. Did you take your pill this morning? It's rosemary. I'm gonna have to stay the night again. Again? Uh-huh. Deadline's tomorrow. It's the biggest project of the quarter. Boss is asking the whole team to burn the midnight oil. I told you not to take too many of those fucking pills. I'm gonna be late now. Make sure you clean all this up. No, no, no, let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out! Let me out, no, please, let me out! Let me out, let me out! John, leave, no! What? Wait, no! No! Get out! Get out of there, go, go! Wait. No, stop! No, John. Oh look! It's a hag stone, a stone with its middle missing? It's supposed to bring good luck. We could use some good luck. If you look through it, you're supposed to see other worlds. Oh yeah, you want to try it out? Can I help you? How much for the book? I'm afraid this particular book is not for sale. Then why is it here? You okay? You all right, Pam? Yeah. I'm all right. What happened? I thought you were choking. No. Mason, I have to tell you this, my dream, I... I was down here in the kitchen and the wind was blowing really loudly so I looked out the window and the trees were being ripped apart. The wind just got louder and louder until it was painful. And then it just stopped. And it got dark. And then I felt something near me. I couldn't see it though, I could just... Feel it. That's a disturbing dream, sweetheart. But it was just a dream, right? Come on, let's go back to bed. Pam? It's here. It knows we see it. What are you doing? - Where is it? - Where is what? My necklace, my stone necklace, where is it? I threw it away. Oh my God. What, Pamela, what am I looking at? Just look at it. What happened to it, Mason? Mason, what did you do with it? Mason, Mason. Mason, Mason. Mason. Wake up. It's not following me anymore. You know the morning when we were at the motel? You said that it's not following you anymore? You know what, never mind. Just forget I said anything. The seeing hole. The seeing hole from the stone. That's what was following me. And I never said it was gone. Are you saying the stone is still here? I threw it out, Pamela, I threw it away. No. It's right here. Pamela, Pamela, are you okay? I can't see, I can't see, I can't see anything. There seems to be nothing wrong with her physically, Mason, but we'd like to keep her for a day or two for psych observation, is that okay with you? Sir, can I come in, please? What is it you want? We're closed. I need your help. Help regarding what? Hey. Hey, where are you going? I need your help. So. You've decided to return what you've taken. Something happened to Pamela. I just thought that... And you thought what, exactly? I thought you would know something about the book. Maybe it had something... Yes, it belongs to me. I didn't know she had taken it. It's just a book. Any recipes or spells in it are just for fun. You're a liar. Listen. Some strange things are happening to my girlfriend, Pamela. I need your help. I've never believed in this kind of thing before, but... I think I'm starting to. And between that weird book and that creepy hag stone, she seems to think things are following her. Hag stone. Yes, the stone. She's had it for a while now. Then she started sleeping with it. Recently it started to freak me out, but now she's going berserk over it. Now she seems to think something's following her. Can you tell me anything? Did you see this something? No. I mean... I don't know. I did feel something. Something cold. You should distance yourself from her. What? You should distance yourself from me. Leave. But Pamela... Now. What... Her optic nerves are in perfect condition. I'm not going to refer her to the optometrist, but I'm going to give you a number to a psychotherapist. Pamela's issues are rooted somewhere in her mind. Her affliction is real, Mason, even if it's not apparent to us. Why is she wearing those? Shit, Pam. You scared the hell out of me. Are you feeling any better? I can see now, Mason. What? I can see now. I can see everything. I'm scared, Mason. Nothing is solid anymore, everything is opening up, like flowers. Mason, please. Help me. Help me, Mason. As you can see, it's complete pandemonium and chaos in the streets. I thank you for allowing me to be your... Your final newscaster here on... Channel four news. I trust that everyone is with their loved ones or doing what they love or making love. For me, it's even... Oh my God. It's happening. Apocalypse, yeah right. Why are people so asinine? I mean, this isn't the first time we tried to predict the end of the world. I remember this whole Mayan Calendar crap a few years ago. You know, it had everyone turning into preppers. Well, I think it's just, well, stupid, how so many people can put so much thought into the end over the present and now, here I am, 2015, January 1st, and... No end of the world, no UFOs, solar flares, no comet and, uh, no return of Cthulhu. Nope, it's just me and my cubicle and another shitty day. It's 6:30 AM in our paradise we call East Prairie, and there isn't a lot of surprises this week. We're going to have a lot of highs in the upper 70s and things are going to... - I - wonder if they noticed if I didn't show up today. Business is business as usual, I like to always say. Everstone Medical has once again surpassed X Quartech as the worlds most valuable company after the release of their new medication, absorvital, that has been proven to eradicate autism within children and adults. Yes, and X Corp's stock has been on the decline... What in the hell is that? Suggesting that its fast growth phase, rare for a company of its size, may be coming to an end. Speaking of coming to an end, there has been speculation... Suggesting that its fast growth phase, rare for a company of its size, may be coming to an end. Speaking of coming to an end, there has been speculation of just that as it pertains to the world. We may have narrowly escaped armageddon a little over two years ago from the supposed Mayan prediction... I don't remember having this box. God, I'm losing it today. Speculations have gone on to say that a local conglomerate, ironically made to save lives, may be the cause of said apocalypse. Skepticism has run heavy over this story since its announcement. We actually go live to Morgan Middlebrook, our man on the street, as he gives us a look on how the city has been taking the news of possible imminent death. No, no, no. No. Oh, you're so gonna charge me for this, I know it. Where the hell did that come from? Another day of being alive after the apocalypse scare. Yes, yet another prediction has... Steps to building self motivation, how to motivate yourself written by Rob Fladry. You have no personality, low self esteem, and have driven yourself into a safe routine life.

Step one, I can't think of a more powerful source of motivation than a cause that you care about. Such cause can inspire you to give your best, even in the face of adversity. It can make you do the seeming... Watch where you're... Just going. Shut up, Julian, shut up and walk away. Oh, God, she's beautiful, why is she just staring at me? Aw, crap, not this guy, every morning. No, I want to get an email to... I wish you'd get in the elevator with me, I wonder if he senses the awkwardness of these elevator rides so he fakes phone conversations. Yeah, sure, I'll just hit a button that you normally can hit yourself, sure, no, no, problem, no, no, not at all, you're the boss. I'm just another slave to your grindstone. I swear. Catch that Bucks game yesterday? No. Dean, all right, yeah, no, good job. Yeah, uh-huh.

Here at EMS, we don't just save lives... It's her. It's really her. I can't believe it, she's... Did she even see me? What is she doing here? She's still out there. What is she doing with that teddy bear? What in the hell? Tonight we are live on the streets where you can see people are in celebration over another day of being alive. Yes, it is true, yet another prediction has been debunked. People are excited, Tom, people are excited. Yes, another prediction has been debunked, giving us all another reason to appreciate the lives that we live, now, let's see if we can't pull the people off the street and get their opinion.

I mean, lions, they're not awkward. I was shocked too. Just to see someone. I know this sounds crazy, I can't imagine what you must be going through. It's kinda nice to be not be talking to the wind or inanimate objects around me. I mean, you're here and I'm here. I remember when I couldn't even pass by people just walking down the street.
