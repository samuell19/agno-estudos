I thought you were on vacation, when your pimp was in jail. But you didn't. You never miss a day. My wife is pregnant. I'll be fired. Go home. Yaakov. Look at Alice running from the police. Alice, honey, run, honey. Run so they don't get you. For Gods sake, let me in. I'll give you all this. - Come here, come here. - Kid, get your hands off me. What do you think this is, a market? Kid, get them off, I said. You want to deal with me? Watch this crazy woman till you get to the station. -Okay. Thought she could run from me, the crazy woman. That's it, we are done, no whores left in the area. Tomorrow you can see them all. You want my opinion? It is a waste of time. I know them since the day they were born. One like that, who was born on the road will die on the road. Damn television, you sons of bitches. You came to film? Fuck you. - What do you want me to do? - I don't know. You can maybe film the one who's singing. "I have nothing but the morning sun above." I need... if you... Where is Miri? Regards to my brother Moshe who is in Abu Kabir prison. If this is how things start, we'll finish this film during the holidays. Guys, here, we film in color. So, he told you? - He found four. - You're kidding. Seriously, he decided to make a musical, now he's working on the voices. Fine, Chaim, I don't have the patience for your humor. Tell me why did they take him off the shelf? Not they, she. It was so big, I don't really know either. - Hello, how are you? - Great. - Shes fine. - Did you find one? There is not a single holy woman in Sodom. Are you looking for a holy woman, or, excuse me, a whore? With all due respect to television, I don't believe you will find a girl who, but it hasn't helped me. You want to tell me that in this whole building, there is not a single girl who wants to change? In this whole town you won't find one who really wants to change. They have nowhere to go back to. You will always find them on the street or here. - Thank you very much. - What was that? That is solitary confinement, they knock three times when they want to see a warden. You put girls in solitary confinement? What do you think? This one is worse than a man, she attacked a policeman yesterday. Come on Yocheved, give me a cigarette, I'm drying up. No smoking in there. Wait, go talk to her. You'll hear from me, you there. That one knows only to spit or be spat on. Sorry. Go talk to her. Can't you see who we're dealing with? Don't talk to her, it's better talking to the wall, believe me. You aren't made of sugar, right, what happened? We won't leave without a girl, right? So go talk to her. Itzik, Avner, unload the equipment. Interview Yocheved, she probably has something to say. I am from the... television... I said I was from... Yes, I heard you are from television. But you have a radio antenna between your legs. I am looking for a girl who wants to rehabilitate... Fuck you, and bring a receipt. You... give receipts? You have never been to a whore, have you? -No. For Gods sake, give me a cigarette. They dried me up in here. That's where you piss. Okay, don't be scared, I won't spit on you. Why are you in solitary confinement? Somebody could have prevented me from being arrested. But he's a son of a bitch. Is that why you spat at him before? Okay, enough, I am not angry at you any more, you can go. - But I need to talk to you. - I have nothing to say to you. What will you tell your boss about not getting me to talk? What boss? I saw how she pushed you in before, that bitch. Okay, what do you have to tell me? The Welfare Ministry conducted a survey, and discovered the percentage of girls working the streets has gone up over the last two years. Now, that survey, that report, leaked to the press, and leaked to the television. What do you want from me? Call a plumber. But they called me. Do you have a lawyer from television? - Why do you need a lawyer? - What why, to get me out. But I can get you out in ten minutes. - And you will get money. - How much? - Whatever an actress gets. - How much does an actress get? I don't know, three thousand, seven thousand there are three filming days. What three days, I make that in less than half a night. Who will pay me? I will, okay? I'll give you an advance payment. You need to know that when you give money to a whore, you never get it back. Well, I can't, I don't want them to see me like this on television, that I am a whore. - They won't recognize you. - What won't recognize? We will make you up. Put on a blond wig... Your mother wouldn't know you. I am a model, only last week they photographed me in Charles Klor Garden for "Alpi" fashions. They gave me a white dress with a red sash and sequins, and things, and flowers in my hair. I can't, okay? My brother is in prison, and I need money to help him. I can't. Wait, how will you get me out of here in ten minutes? Eight... Come on, give me another cigarette, the clock is ticking. - This is where you live? - Yes. - Right here? - Up there. I like the height. - I am going to buy cigarettes. - Okay. Come here, give me cigarettes, those. Alice, what are you doing here? I thought you were in prison. Go on honey, get out of here. I told you a thousand times, I don't want to see you here. What is it Alice? I'm here only because you were arrested. I am going to my daughter tomorrow, and I can't even afford to buy her a cookie. Fine, go on, go take him. But then get out of here. Great, Alice. Lucky Bruriya isn't here, she would have killed you. What, I don't have problems? He wants you... I said five thousand, he said okay. Never mind, honey, maybe someone from the old days will come and remember you. I've forgotten more than you know. When I was young, they came especially for me, from Haifa, Beer Sheva. When you are my age, you will stand here and remember me. When I am your age, I will be far from here. At your age I will have a penthouse, and a Cadillac, and a villa, And children who eat cookies all day long. Too many cookies are bad for the teeth. Go on. God bless you. Come on, give me the money. I gave you money today. There are no whores today, they are all in Abu Kabir. You're like glue, what do you want from me? What do I want from you? Nothing. If it was up to me we wouldn't... - Wouldn't what? - Met, wouldn't have met. But we did meet. Just a moment. Right, I got you out of prison, posted bail, gave you money, and you leave without saying goodbye. Thank you for getting me out, sorry I need to... When you talked in the cell, I thought you had self respect. Don't use such long sentences. Fine, I don't have respect, okay? Because I have a brother in prison who needs a lawyer. And I don't have a rich daddy in Tel Aviv, to give me money. I have a pussy between my legs, and it is my mother and my father and my respect. Okay? I spent the money you gave me. And I only just got started. - Want a trick for the rest? - No, thank you. Well done, I am good enough for you for television, but not for a trick. - What is your name, anyway? - Yoram. - Yoram? - Yes. Nice name. Come closer. - Come on, are you scared? - No. Yoram, you are very nice, but you don't know what a whores world is like. You have never even been to a whore, have you? - That's what you told me, right? - Right. It isn't your world. You have friends, I am alone. If they knew I was on television, they'd kill me. Understand? Wait here for half an hour, I'll give you your money. Okay. Wait, why did you pick me, I'm cross-eyed, aren't I? - That's why. - What do you mean? - Marylin Monroe was also. - Who? Fuck patiently, or jerk off. He thinks this is a department store. I really would like to be an actress, but I can't, I have to work. He didn't even come and he already wants a discount. Thinks this is the health service. Yoram. Yoram. Yoram. Yoram. Yoram. Yoram. Yoram. Quiet, why are you yelling in the middle of the night. Okay, what do you want? Go on, quiet, go in, go in. Alice. Hi Yoram. - Miri. - Yes? - Shes here. - Who? The whore. - Well? Good. - Yes, it is good. Miri, can you come over now? - Now? What for? - To talk to her. Sorry. I didn't know which house was yours, they all look... - Were you asleep? - No, I am never asleep at four. Come in. No, I just came to give you your money back. Okay, but please sit down. - How much do I owe you? - What? What do you mean, what? - I don't know, don't remember. - What's that? - What? - The telephone. That's so they don't wake me. After you left the clients didn't stop coming. -Yes? They stood in line, like at the movies. If I make as much every night, I'll buy a villa in six months, a year, at the most. Here, take it. What is that? Carmen. Cantorial Music? A woman cantor? No, Carmen is an opera. - Carmel. - Yes, Carmen. Nice name, Carmel. There is also Carmel Market. Yes. Do you want to eat anything? No, when I finish work, I can't put a thing in my mouth. Is that why you are so thin? Don't I have a nice body? - How old are you? - How old do I look? I don't know, sixteen. Seventeen. What seventeen? I will be eighteen in a month. When I'm eighteen, I'll go to America. What's that? I think you should go to sleep early tonight. I can't sleep before morning. But I need to sleep, I have to film tomorrow. Go to sleep, who's bothering you? Yes. Good night. Good night. From the day I was born, no one cared about me. My father was very rich, even in Iraq. And he married my mother, who was pretty, but Ashkenazi. That's why they didn't get along, and fought a lot. And then, when I was thirteen, she died. Because she had such a hard life, and was very sick. So she died. And then, when I sat in bed crying all the time, my father came into my room and said: "your mother is dead, you have no one to cry for." And then suddenly, he got into my bed, and started touching me all over. I prayed to God I would die like my mother. But early in the morning, while he was still asleep, I ran away. I ran to Tel Aviv. I had never been to Tel Aviv before. So I walked the streets, hanging out in stores, and especially the movies. I love movie theaters. At night, I slept in the park, because it was summer and still warm. One day I met Shimshon. Erase that, okay? One day I met Shmuel, and he worked in the Carmel market, he gave me fruit and vegetables because I had nothing to eat. He also bought me new clothes, and took me out. That's how love caught me. One day I found I was pregnant. So I went to Shmuel and said, lets get married. And he said, "Maybe I'm not the father?" Yes, that's what he said. "Maybe I am not the father." So that day, I ran away from him. I walked the streets, because I needed money for an abortion. I started walking the streets, finding one client here another one there. And since then I'm deep inside and can't get out. Just praying God helps and gets all the whores off the streets. And me first. Cut. Good, now please take off the clothes, so they don't get dirty. I only talk to him, he is my boss. Yoram, come here a minute. Would you like to explain to Alice she should take off the clothes so they don't get dirty. What do you mean dirty? I'll be careful. Yoram, let me wear them a little longer. Is it very important? I just want to understand. Yes, it is important and preferable. - Yes? - Yes. Okay, I'll explain it to her. Fine. As soon as possible, right? Let's ride on the horses, Yoram. Later. Move it, move it! See you, Bruriya. Come here, you, you. My husband was with you a week ago and got syphilis. I feel like shoving it up your ass, you Bruriya. My God, I would never have recognized you if you hadn't opened your dirty mouth, Alice. - What is this Halloween? - It's for television. Those people who were in the jail yesterday? -Yes. They took me to their house, and to the amusement park. What for? What for? They filmed me and filmed me. All day, they filmed only me, and again tomorrow. Don't let them fool you, you hear? I am no ones fool. They bought me all these clothes, suit me? And how, you look like a woman in a movie. Here's Tzadok coming to get you. I'll go see Shimshon before they close. Who's that beauty? - Alice. - Alice? They filmed her for television. Probably told stories about all of us, that bitch. No stories. You have a dirty mind. Fine, go. Go, what are you waiting for. Damn those television people. Yes. Yes, sure. Sure, real smart. What if one of her criminal friends, kills her tomorrow. Did you think of that? No, so that's why I'm doing this. You wanted to put her in that pig sty? What will she think of us? I wasn't talking to you, Listen, I want you to let me put her in a hotel. No, don't get me angry, I didn't mean the Hilton. Just a hotel. No... I don't want... okay... I don't want to run after her every night, discovering her in a different drug hole. - Where is she? - She left. What left? Wait, I will talk to you later. - Where did she go? - I don't know. You're joking? I'm not joking, Miri. She got into a taxi and left. Okay, lets go to Abu Kabir and get another one. What's the rush to Abu Kabir? I don't get it. Maybe she went to change. Miri, lets wait for her. Maybe she'll come back. You're kidding, we film tomorrow morning, you know? We waste another two days, and we can forget the film. The boss doesn't care about the film. - Who cares about the film? - Me. - Yes? - Yes, me. I care about the film. It's an important film. It has an important message. Only a film like this will open peoples eyes, to the problem of those poor women. Okay, as the Chief Executive, I am convinced. I also convinced him to let you direct something big. Is that because you think I am a good director, or because I... For the... I could find something better, believe me. So could I. Hi, Shimshon. - Who bought you that? - People from television... They were here yesterday, and we were all inside. I was in solitary, and they got me out, the only one. They bought me all this and gave me money. They want to film me. - Did they? - Of course not. If you are lying to me, Alice, you will pay. Why would I lie to you Shimshon? I went with them only to get out. They gave me money, I got you everything you wanted. Don't talk to them, or get filmed, or you will pay. In four days, they take me before a judge. If there is no lawyer to sweet talk him, he will keep me here till the trial. This is not the original. I will get you the best lawyer, Shimshon. I work and work all the time. Don't take pills or smoke, just work and wait for you. Why did you put that on? Scared the television people will say you have a boyfriend who hurts you if you run away? You can grow your hair. This really isn't the original? Hello. Yes, one moment. Yes. Yes, I remember I have children. Yes, I even love them, believe it or not. Right... right... I also miss them, a lot. Yes, no, but let me... Let me get a word in, talk a minute. - Okay, so I will come on Friday. - What on Friday? Because I am shooting a film. Okay, so I... I will come tomorrow... One word out of her, and you are down on all fours. Look at yourself. She's the mother of my children. My dog hasn't eaten in two days. - I'm going to sleep. - Yes? We film tomorrow morning, be sure everything is in place, including the girl. Okay? Ciao. Ciao. Hello Emil, I'm sorry I'm a little late. Remember when you first met Emil? Three years ago you met Emil. Remember where you met Emil? In the Covshim Garden you met him, with the Arabs, the dirt and the market. I was like a father to you. Did I let you sleep in my home? I did. Did I buy you new clothes? I did. Did I post bail for you? I did. So why do I deserve this? I came two weeks ago and you weren't here. I came a week ago and you weren't here. Today you nearly didn't come. Why, why do I deserve this? Enough, enough. Enough. I didn't come because they put Shimshon in prison. And you urgently need money for a lawyer? - Yes. - Okay. First come here the three times I waited and you didn't come, and then maybe we will sit and talk. Tenure is the important thing, everything is taken care of. You know Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. I give a little to Tzadok, to impress his friends. And everything... what is left, to the bank. How much longer can we work, three, five, ten years, and then you get out, and you know, things are taken care of. You can buy an apartment, open a boutique, Some idiot detective has come to visit us. He's from television, the ones filming Alice. - Can we help you? - No, thank you... Alice, would you come here a moment, please? -What for? - I want to talk to you. - Talk, what's stopping you? Would you please come to the car, please? I only come to the car for a trick, want a trick? May I know why Alice is being filmed, if I may ask? Stop fooling around, Tzadok, get in you car and go. - What did you say your name was? - I didn't. Nice to meet you. Go on, get in the car and go. I need to talk to Alice. What do you have to say to Alice? What I have to say to her, I will say to her. Why do you want to be clever? Look up, there are clouds. It will rain soon, you will get wet, what a pity. Look up, look. Tzadok, enough, leave him... - That was from Shimshon. - Tzadok. When he gets out he will get even with you. Go on, go play snooker, let us work. A whore gets beatings like that from her man every week. It isn't worth it, Yoram. I told you, leave that movie. It'll only do harm, to me and you. Don't let them see us, or they will kill me. What I told you this morning, when they were filming... It was a lie. Right, so why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to embarrass you in front of everyone. Anyway, you lied well. Why did you lie? With you, you can't tell if you are dumb or pretending to be. Don't use such long sentences. You, as a father, if your daughter became a whore, what would you do? I would kill myself. That's why I lied. Go on, get up, you look like Steve McQueen. - Who is Shimshon? - My brother. I told you I had a brother in prison, didn't I? You did. But leave my parents out of it, okay? Okay. Careful you don't fall, honey. You see that house? That's the school I went to. This is my parents house. Wait a minute, Yoram, maybe we'll come another day? No, it will be fine, I will explain everything to them. I promise, come on. Wait, maybe I'll take off the wig? No, no, it's great. You look great. - Really? - Yes, you look great, come on. It will be fine, I'll explain everything to them. - Hello. - It's our Aliza. Let's go, Yoram, we shouldn't be here, I told you. - I will explain. - There is nothing to explain. Father is feeling a little ill, come in. Alice, Alice... Please, we are having lunch, will you join us? I am from television. Every week someone comes and wants to sell a television. It is about your daughter. I don't have a daughter. Here, you see the tools I have worked with for twenty years, they don't respond to me. When I came to Israel, I kissed the earth, I didn't ask. They took me to a camp, I didn't ask. Financial problems started, the children rebelled at home. But they are good children. In the war... they are great. But Aliza, my youngest, Maybe I was a bad father. So what, a father. I love her. She always had a dream... The street. Fifteen years old, she left home. Maybe you can find her a job? Aliza is a very good girl. It will be okay. Get out before you embarrass everyone. I hope you haven't been waiting to long. Is something cooking? It seems we came in time. Nice house, nice. Who is this in the picture, Alice? The ceiling will cause an echo. Looks like her mother, right, Yoram? The fuses will barely support a candle. If we want to film here, we will have to get power from the neighbors. It is okay, I will talk to them. What is it, what is going on? Is this why you came? In this line of work, it isn't age that counts, I had a client who paid me to be naked, and he would strip and ask me to hit him with his belt. He cried like a child. Then he got dressed and went to run the country. Careful he doesn't kill himself laughing. Doesn’t it bother you that you are... Whore, say whore, don't be shy, it is work, like any other. I had a client, a doctor, one day he asked me, "Why don't you work with me? Work in the lab." Would you mind turning it down a little? Turn the radio down, please. Turn down the radio. I said to him, what is that? He said, urine and feces. I said to him, doctor, it is cleaner to be a whore. Enough, some quiet, okay? My head. Getting arrested each time, doesn't? What do I care? During the war, for instance, I was in Abu Kabir prison, and I heard the newspapers and radio asking for money for the army. So I went to the warden, and told her, give me just four hours freedom, I will go work, bring in a lot of money for the army. They can buy a tank, a plane, whatever they want. What are you doing? Nothing, just charging the battery. - What is it? - Nothing. Yoram, I told the guys stories, and they filmed me. - You filmed her? - Of course not. - Did you... - Of course not. They didn't film. Of course they did, he pointed the camera. They didn't. You aren't on the street, calm down. They did film. It won't be in the movie. I promise, I decide what is and is not in the movie. - Yes? And what is she? - She is at home. Sorry. - You... - This is an opera, be quiet. Look at the size of his dick. Alice, please be careful, this is a road, okay? - What do you care about me? - I care, of course I care. I called you all yesterday afternoon, there was no answer. I was at the dolphinarium. - Why, had a difficult childhood? - Not me, Alice. - What is happening to you? - I don't know. Instead of thinking of the film you are busy courting, Yoram. Right. This is not the time to lose your head. The boots, aren't they hot during the summer? No, I am used to it. - Yes? - Yes, it is comfortable. - You're not wearing a bra? - No. No, why, is something wrong with me? You're crazy, sit down. I don't know what is going on. Why is he filming me? How fat, what an ass. She needs a diet, doesn't she? Idiot. Go ahead, Aliza. Hello, nice to meet you. This is our producer. Miri, nice to meet you, we've spoken. This is Aliza. Aliza, honey, how you've grown. She was the best girl in our institute. Our institute, Sofia Institute for rehabilitating working girls. - What is it? - You'll see. What are you doing here Rachel? A week ago they brought me here, said I would be here two years. Get me out of here, Aliza. How can I get you out? Tell your friends from the television to get me out. Okay, I will get you out. We were told to do a documentary about problems of rehabilitation, you make a drama, starring that whore. - You are the only one? - It is late, everyone left. So why are you working? Did you come for an interview or sex? Give me the money. - Here. - Come on. - You must make a lot of money. - Are you from the IRS? I eat thirty suckers like you for breakfast. - Come here, honey, don't be shy. - Say, can we do it over there? What do I look like, a color TV? There are people there, can't you see? - Yes. - Come on, honey. - Is it clean here? - Your mother is clean, come on. Come here. Come closer. Start, good, good. You jerk, Yoram, he has a hard on, in a minute he would have tried for real. Damn you. Would I risk it with one like this? Come on. You said to treat her like an actress, so I am. I can't concentrate with her, I can't do this. Forget concentrating. What are you, Marlon Brando? Concentrate, do it over from the part by the fence. - I can't do it like this. - You want me to do it for you? I don't want to do it. Smart guy, I said you should use a pro. -Enough. Damn your pros. Enough, he won't do it again. Right Gideon? Right? But I don't want to do it, I left it behind, right? - Of course you did. - So I don't want to do it. What, you don't want to do it? You don't want to do it? It is only a film, you idiot. You did it your whole life, can't you pretend once more? You pretend. It's going to rain in a minute. Lets do it once more before the rain, okay? Please. Please, okay? Okay? Action. "We promised in a weak moment, that if it ended," "we would end it nicely. I know and you know..." - Thank you. - Cheers. Cheers, Alice, your health. Cheers. Cheers guys. Cheers. No one is drinking with me? Potatoes, no? Thank you, thank you. - Beautiful. - Who? She. - Come work with us a little? - Much too hard work. Well get something for you in the head office, you have good references. She could be a script girl, I swear. Yes, that is the job. I have plans with Yoram, stay out. I wouldn't recognize her. I know nothing about rehabilitation, and I know even less after this film, but I know a little about filming. A little. And after the last week, filming Alice, it will be hard to go back to filming other actors. I want to tell you something, excuse me. I want to tell you a secret. In high school with me, there was this girl, and I was crazy about her, and she... I was almost left back one grade for that, she didn't pay any attention to me, never even smiled at me. It is no secret. What I want to say is, the secret is she looked just like Alice, only Alice is nicer. Now, we have here, I want to give you a present from the crew, so you always know what time it is, and that you can always call and come visit. - Bravo. - Bravo, Alice. - Thank you, how nice. - Right? What candles! Put on your yarmulke, I will say the blessing. - I want to tell you something. - Go ahead. A secret. Are you serious? What? What? - Let's make another film, Yoram. - Film? What film? Once there were two good friends, and they grew up in the same neighborhood. One became a nurse in a hospital, the other started working the streets. One day the one on the streets had enough and she ran away from her pimp, but he ran after her and cut her face and body, and dumped her in the road. Luckily a car came by and took her to hospital, she almost died on the way. So they quickly operated on her. When she opened her eyes, she saw the nurse, and it was the friend she grew up with. Nice story. I want to be the nurse. I don't want to be the whore. How did you get in? - Does he pay you for this? - Of course not. - Nice shirt. - Yes, it's not mine. Alice, can you get me a towel from the closet? No, me, wait, I'll get it, I want to surprise him. - Is it late? - No, I was early. You scared me. Why did you give my good silk shirt to the maid, - when she is cleaning? - To Alice. You call her Alice? Two days ago you called her the whore. What exactly do you want, Miri? I don't want her here - What? I don't want her here, enough. The film is over, I want her to leave. Where Miri, where? This is not something you use and throw away. We need to help her, she can't go back to the street. I really want to help her. I made a lot of noise to make this film, you know. I let you play around while we filmed, but enough, I don't want her here under my feet. Somebody mentioned troubled girls, and rehabilitation. I don't care about rehabilitation, Yes? -I won't suffer so you can be nice. Our luck went with the summer. Are you coming to Frankfurt this year? - Well see, if it works out. - Lets see you stop, sucker. What is it, leave it, it is a taxi. Probably a woman looking for her husband. - Hey, its Alice. - Dresses like a lady, that one. Got time off from television, came to put on a fashion show. Hi, how are you? Shimshon has a trial, I need money for a lawyer. Didn’t the television give you money? They will, we only finished filming today. If I don't get money by morning he will be in till the trial. Better he stays in and doesn't come out. He will kill you. That's what Tzadok said. What is it to you what Tzadok said and didn't say. Don't just stand there, move. It is very slow today, we haven't made anything yet. A man spends three million on a car, but won't pay five thousand for a trick. Hertzel will kill me if I don't bring him anything. He won't kill you or anything. Here is someone, take him, give him a high price. I don't feel like working now. Good for you, pretending you are in Hollywood. Ilana. Okay, you take her. - Thank you. - Slow today. Okay, fine, I will be okay. Alice, take care you don't get in to too much trouble. You know Bruriya, I was with them for a few days, I told them about my life, and how I feel, on the road, with all the jerks and fear. I felt great next to all those geeks. You know what I think, Bruriya? I think the life we live, is shit. No one would care if we lay on the road, dead. Stop talking nonsense, Alice, you have really lost it. You need to decide if you are here or there. I am not here and not there. I am in the clouds. Look. You are crazy. - Alice. - Hi. - Hi, how are you? - Fine, how are you? - Fine. - I was here, so I dropped in. Come in, would you like coffee, beer, juice, something? No, I have something personal to say. -Personal? Yes, my father is sick, they took him to hospital. What is it, something serious? He needs an operation, something in the liver. - Oh dear. - I need a loan. - I will pay you back, Avner. - No, it is okay. I will get money from my friends, come in. No, I will stay here, I feel uncomfortable. Okay, so wait a second. Alice, come here a second. Hi, how are you? We, the guys, decided that... we want to help you with money. Thank you. - You tell her, I don't want to. - You brought her, you tell. I mean... We... They want... Sex, sex. What sex? - No, we want to help. - Like this? Alice, but you said it wasn't a problem for you, you did it easily. That's what you think. You jerks. You don't care, you. You won't sleep with me for a million or for nothing. This is what you do after what happened all the last week? What will happen when you get him out? Will you go back to the street? Leave me alone, you have nothing with me. You finished your movie, you don't have to lie any more. What did you do with your boss? Have sex in the bathroom? No, Alice, I was out half the night looking for you, that is what I did. Let's go, I found work for you. You should go to sleep early tonight, come on. Tell that Miri, that if I see her around I will cut her face. Fine. Daddy, look what mummy bought us. She looks a little like me, doesn't she? She doesn't look anything like you. She looks like Erols mother. Erol must look like his father. - How is he? - Fine. - He is in New York now. - New York? He works hard. -Yes, he has to, with a house like this. With you I would have settled for much less. A pity I didn't feel it when we were together. A real pity. And books, and we have so many toys I don't remember. What is her story, she was a whore, and? No, no story. That's it, she was a whore, now she doesn't want to be one. - That is it? - Daddy, look. That's great. What's your name? - David. - And yours? Yonatan. David and Yonatan, how nice. There is a story about your names, isn't there? There is a story about my name too. You know "Alice in Wonderland"? Once there was a girl called Aliza, her name was Aliza. And she was a nice and beautiful girl, and she had very long hair, and she was also a very very good girl. One day her big sister gave her a candy, a very very sweet one. And she, Aliza, her head started spinning, and she felt really high. What is high? It means she became very small. And when she was so small, she fell into a hole in the road, and fell and fell... Till she got to a garden... What can I say? The most beautiful garden she had ever seen. There, she saw all kinds of animals, she saw a rabbit, who was bigger than her. And she saw all sorts of other animals, and she saw a donkey. - This is a pony, not a donkey. - A donkey with bangs. And there were all sorts of birds with feathers. What can I say, she had never seen such colors. And she played with them, and was very happy, and they all became friends. Suddenly she woke up and saw it was all a dream. And she really hadn't been so small. Look what nice fish. Lets throw, I want to get the fish. Two fish, I hit. Be small and come to kindergarten with us. Okay, I will try. Why are you crying? Because I can never be small again. Alice. Come, sit, come. - Want to drink something? - No, thank you. - How was it with the children? - Great, little devils. I am glad. A few more changes and the film is ready. Let's go eat ice cream. Don't give the film to television, Yoram. - Fine. - No, really, don't give it. What do you mean? In the cell, you talked of rehabilitation, right? - Right. - What about my rehabilitation? This film is your rehabilitation. So lets make another film, instead of rehabilitation. What film? You changed me, right? So no one would know me. - Right. - You made me into a person. Well. -Now I am a person, Alice is dead, and Aliza was reborn. And she wants to marry, and she wants children, and, so don't give the film, okay, Yoram? But I can't not give the film to television, Alice. Aliza. Aliza. I am only the director. Like Avner is in charge of lighting, Itzik films, and Miri is the producer. What do you want me to do? But they didn't talk to me, you did. - Yes. - And? And what? You talked to me of respect, you have none. Thank you. You are like my pimp. He would sell me for money, you sell me for the film. You would never be with one who was a whore, right? Why did you bring that hair again? I want you to buy me a gold ring, and a white dress. Lets get married, have a baby. If you have a baby, how will you work? Of course I won't work. So who will work? Lets open a boutique, both of us, Shimshon. This is what Tzadok told me. You were with those television people all week, telling them things. - Tzadok is a jerk. - Starting today you go to work. And give Tzadok at least ten thousand every day. And if they film you, I will cut you up. Starting today, you will give Tzadok money every day. I will be pregnant and have children. We were in the room, having sex, I get dressed, he gives me fifty dollars, I was about to go down, and he tells me to wait, said: "Come tomorrow and I will send you a plane ticket to New York." - I told you, all men are bad. - What can I do? Go on, Ilana, honey, you have a client, go. She is busy, can't you see? You go. - I can't, you have ruined me. - Go, go on, go. - Bruriya, where is Alice? - Doesn’t work anymore. Go on, beat it. Okay, go away, you're interfering with our work. Go away, you're in our way. - What are you doing here, Yoram? - Looking for Alice. The film is being screened in three hours, it should be on the way to Jerusalem. You can look for her without the film, can't you? She doesn't want us to show the film. -She doesn't? Don't be a child, Yoram. After her first client she will forget the film. She will also forget you. Miri, leave it, we're not giving this film to television. - Who is we? - Sorry, not we, me. So you can start looking for work, they will fire you tonight. Go be her pimp. A pimp, that is what you will be. Who is it? Alice? No. It's Aliza. With Yehoram Gaon as Yoram Anat Atzmon as Alice. Gila Almagor as Miri. "Dead End Street" English: Yael Baker Subtitles: Elrom Studios
