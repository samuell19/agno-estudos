Are you ready for this? Well, let's find out, shall we? Ah. Can we leave now? Where are we? Well, congratulations. You must be very proud. Oh, we are. And thank you for coming, Jean. It means so much to Patrick and me. To be honest, Lucien and I were a touch surprised to be invited. Oh, well, Edward absolutely insisted that you both be here. Really? Thank you, Lucien. Stop playing games. I know what you're up to, Edward. It's gone on long enough. I couldn't agree more. If you think I'm just going to stand by and let it happen, then... Then you'll what? You're making a big mistake. Edward? Relax, dad. Enjoy the party. You're the one paying for it. Sons, Lucien! You raise them in the hope that one day they might turn out to be a better man than you ever were. You've done all you can, Patrick. Thank you, lad. He's his own man now, for better or worse. That's what I'm afraid of. My girl, my Hattie, has been my everything ever since her mother passed. Speak up! But not once did I ever have to look after her, because she's always looked after me. Get on with it! Always look after me. I'd like to thank you all for being here today, especially the father of the bride, Milton, and all of you who've made the journey up from Melbourne. Uh, the bridal party, of course, and the best man, Brian, who's done an admirable job of keeping our son in line today. No easy task, as I'm sure many of you know. I'd like to propose a toast to Edward, our son, a man of eclectic interests, jack of all trades, and to our new daughter-in-law, Harriet. We wish you all the very best of luck, my dear. You're going to need it. To Edward and Harriet. Edward and Harriet. Well, as most of you would know, I left Ballarat recently with my tail between my legs. I made a lot of mistakes. Cheers for the reminder, dad. But then I found Harriet, and she helped me see what's truly important in life and she showed me how to be a better man. To my wife. Edward, please. Don't touch me! You're hurting me! Now we can leave. Not a moment too soon. Oh dear. Boys. Full of beans, aren't they? Now, just regular table salt in some warm water and, uh... Playing tag, aren't they? And you just gargle that. Little one might be hungry, eh? Mm. Tell me, Mrs. Wilkinson, you and your husband, are you planning on having any more children? I hope not. Right. Well, there's a medication that's just became available that may be of some interest to you. You're not Catholic, are you? No. Why? Just checking. She's here. Show her in. Mrs. Lucas, come through. Dorothy, won't you come in? This is... well, it's certainly unexpected. I'm just as happy to see you as you are to see me, Lucien. Believe me. Right. What can I do for you? I want you to go to Melbourne for me. I need you to find my granddaughter. Catherine? She's missing, is she? Depends what you mean by missing. She's... For years, every month, I would send her an allowance, you see. Traveling agrees with her. Parties, the big cities. Unfortunately, it all began to agree with her a little too much. So you... Cut her off. About a year ago. For her own good. Catherine's always been highly strung. She needed to learn. I stopped hearing from her afterwards. Not a letter, not a telephone call, nothing. And now what, you expect me to help you find her just like that? Well, you're still my nephew, aren't you? I'm afraid I'm terribly busy at present, Dorothy. You might have to ask some... I'm dying, Lucien. Endometrial cancer, or so my specialist tells me. Oh, Dorothy. A friend in Melbourne spotted this late last year. Not long after I received a telegram from her asking for money. Catherine is the only real family that I have left. I would very much like to see her if only so as to get my affairs in order. Dorothy, Dr. Spencer and your specialist, they've discussed all the options with you? They're good doctors. Just think about it. Dorothy. Doctor. Mrs. Beazley. JEAN: Mrs. Lucas. Are you finished yet? I do apologize for this. Come on, come on! You promised to come play with me. Please! Lucien, that's enough! Genevieve? Genevieve? Please, I'm with a patient! Dr. Lucien Blake. Slashed throat, I heard. Still no sign of the new police surgeon. Wallace. He'll show up. Eventually. Mr. Tyneman turned up maybe half an hour ago. Thought he was going to punch someone. The police had to escort him away. I see. Have they spoken with anyone else? The bride and her father have been told to remain in the honeymoon suite until uncle Matthew's ready to question them, which will probably be sooner rather than later. Right. Doctor. Superintendent. Took your time, didn't you? What have we got? Bill. Doc. Throat's been cut. Arterial spray here, blood in the water. Time of death? I can't be sure. Not yet. No sign of a murder weapon. Yes. Well, keep looking. Anything else? Doesn't look like it belongs to the victim. Not enough blood. Which means it could belong to his killer. I'll run some tests after I've completed the autopsy. Of course we remember you from the wedding, Doctor. Thank you for seeing her. She's being very brave about all this. She's right here, dad. I'm sorry, darling. Your pulse is still a touch fast, I have to say. Yeah. I've been trying to keep warm, control my heart rate, my breathing. You've had some medical experience. Oh, God. Please, just not right now. Just let me breathe. Milton, tell me, when did you last see Edward? When I called it a night, he was still drinking with the best man and a couple of business associates. And Harriet, forgive me for asking, do you recall what time Edward eventually came back upstairs? He didn't. It wasn't until this morning that I realized he hadn't been to bed. The last thing that I said to him... I told him that if he wanted to spend his wedding night with Brian, then perhaps he should have married him and not me. You know, I think for now, let's pop you back into bed, eh? Allow me. Here we are. That's it. Up we go. Milton, I might... Blake? A word. Excuse me. For the last time, you cannot be involved in this investigation. But the sheets, Matthew. Traces of dirt, grass. I think... Look, if you try anything like this again, I'll have you arrested. You understand? Of course. We'll discuss it when you get home. Severed carotid and jugular. One motion, by the looks of it. Write that down, would you? Incised wound to the neck. Mechanism of death, hemorrhage. No defensive injuries. No marks on the face or chest. No internal abnormalities to speak of. Nothing wrong with the heart or liver. Actually, he suffered from ongoing atrial fibrillation. Probably inherited from his father. It's in his patient history. There's no additional marks at the edges of the wound, which means the blade that caused this injury didn't have a serrated edge. Did you check the kitchen at the crime scene for a possible murder weapon? I left that to the police. I'll get started on the tissue from the crime scene, then. I can do it. Doctor, I... Miss Harvey, as police surgeon, I will oversee testing of any and all evidence discovered at a crime scene. Do I make myself clear? It's Dr. Harvey. Uh, Mr. Tyneman, sir. Patrick. This is really happening, isn't it? Has Matthew... Are they speaking to anyone yet? Yes, they are. People from the wedding. The girl, her father. Three months, Edward had known them! Three months. And he trusted them both implicitly. But you don't? We don't know anything about them. They come from Richmond. What does the father do? Where did the girl go to school? Where's the family? Edward must have known about their background, surely. Yeah, well, if he did, he didn't tell me. They must have something to do with this. They must have. I can't even begin to imagine how difficult this must be for you and Susan. But trust me, what you need is... What I need is answers, Blake. I need someone to go down to Melbourne for me. To dig around. Find out something about them. I haven't got anybody else to ask. What do you mean, the paper tissue was accidentally destroyed? Well, unfortunately, the wrong kind of solvent was used somehow. That woman I've been saddled with, you have no... I have known Dr. Harvey for some time, and there is one thing that she is not, and that is careless. Are you telling me that the one piece of physical evidence that we have so far, you have managed to ruin? Give her a bloody rest. Bill, um, I found this in the hotel towel room. You don't want to hang around and give this to the boss yourself, do you? Are these all the RSVPs for the wedding? Almost all of them. Have you heard from your boys? Well, Christopher's just been posted overseas. And Jack, well... There's still three weeks to go. Yes, you're right. And Rose, I've been meaning to talk to you about Charlie. He might be coming to the wedding. No. The decision was entirely mutual. We're friends. Much better that way. Have you heard from him recently how detective training's been going? No, not recently. He's still sequestered in barracks. Hello? Mm, there you are. I thought I was going to have to catch the train. We're popping down to Melbourne to do some wedding shopping. How exciting. Do you know what kind of suit you'll be getting? Vaguely. Oh, and you've got work to do. Yes. Yes, I have. Patrick's asked me to look into a few things for him. Actually, Rose, perhaps you could join us. I could use your help. Oh, that's not exactly what I was talking about. Hm? She's still your auntie, Lucien. And we're going to be there anyway. So just to be clear, you didn't leave your room until this morning? That's right. At which point, you went outside in your slippers and your dressing gown to go for a swim. You walked down the garden path. Sorry. You dived into the pool and found Edward's body. By the fountain, yes. So if you had your slippers on before and after you went into the water, why did they find dirt stains and grass on the inside of your sheets? Uh, perhaps the staff hadn't changed them. All right, yes. I went looking for Edward late last night. In the garden? No. No, out the front of the hotel on the porch. In the ballroom, the kitchen. In the towel room? Yes. Why? For the love of God. Would you shut the hell up? Come on. No need for that. You need to calm down, son. Oi! Oi! I wouldn't turn my back if I was you. Mr. Underwood. I've known Edward for, I don't know, a year or two? You didn't think it was strange, him choosing you to be his best man? Maybe he picked me because of my, uh, winning personality. Or maybe no one else wanted the job. My family's known the Tynemans for over 30 years. And you and Edward were close? Yes. Harriet introduced us not long after they began seeing each other. He said before they moved any farther with their relationship, he should meet me. Edward Tyneman said that? He wanted to do things the proper way. Look, why is my daughter waiting in a cell? Well, there are a few discrepancies in her story, Mr. Dunne. She didn't do anything. You said you and Mr. Tyneman were the last ones to pull up stumps last night. We were talking business. My car yard. I'm looking to expand, and I was hoping Ed might be convinced to back me. Edward had been cut off from his father's money. Had he? So from there, you... Got in my car, went to the garage, and had a kip in the office for a few hours. And no one can vouch for you? Only one bridesmaid at the wedding. Not great odds here. Yes, I was asked to leave. I wanted to congratulate Edward properly, but his friend stepped in before I had the chance. Peggy, according to the guest list, you weren't invited to the wedding, were you? I've only recently returned from overseas. I didn't see the harm in dropping in. From what I've heard about your past with Edward, I'm wondering why you'd want to be there at all. Edward had a past. Everybody does, superintendent. He treated my daughter like a princess. He was a perfect gentleman. Could be cruel when he wanted to be. Who do you think would want to kill Edward, Mr. Underwood? In this town? Get in line. Ah. This is it, hey? We can stay, you know. That's bad luck. Go on. I'll be fine. So where do we start? Right. I appreciate this, I really do, but I wasn't sure who else to speak to. I get it, Doc. Look, I'll run a background check, see if they've got some priors. It's Milton and... Harriet Dunne. D-U-N-N-E. Thanks. Now, when should we pop back? I don't know. We're pretty busy here, being the police. Yes, of course. I tell you what. We're meeting Jean for dinner tonight at, uh, Burrows on Collins Street. Why don't you join us? We can compare notes. I'll see what I can do. Miss Anderson. Danny? Thank you. Now, before I forget, here's the address. Births, Deaths, and Marriages. Great. And where will you be? Well, you want to learn more about a man, you find his local pub and chat to the regulars. So, basically, you're going drinking. Yes. For research purposes. So these are some of our best suits. Perfect for the mother of the bride. It's not exactly what I had in mind. Oh, it was very, very clever. Another? Yes. Why not, eh? And I tell you what... I was wondering if you could help me. I'm looking for a couple of friends of mine, Milton and Harriet Dunne. Don't know them. No? Do you know anyone here who might? It's gorgeous. What do you think? It's very nice. And it fits beautifully. I think we may have found the one. Yeah, I met that Dunne bloke and his daughter maybe a couple of times. You did? Yeah. They come up with a young fellow from Ballarat. Right. I see. And what can you tell us about them, Milton and Harriet? Well, your young fella, he paid for everything. Milton was either skint or he'd just forgotten his wallet every time he walked out the door. That old chestnut. May I? Yes. As long as the groom doesn't see. Wow! Bright purple was a bold choice, don't you think, Lucien? Hm? Yes, it'll match the shade of violet I'm planning to dye my hair. You're dying... you're not dying. I'm sorry. I'm miles away. Not the most productive afternoon, I'm guessing? Neither of us managed to find anything particularly helpful regarding Harriet or Milton. What about Catherine Lucas? Yes. I... I did... well... You didn't even look, did you? Couldn't you just check the granddaughter's address? Thanks, again. Oh, bugger. Bloody hell! Those letters we found just inside the front door, the postmarks go back around eight weeks or so. Doc... Which corresponds with the dusty furniture in the living room, yes? - Yes, but none of that... - So if she's been missing for... none of that gives you the right to break into her house, Doc. Lucien, are you all right? Yes, you know, I'm perfectly fine, Jean. Thank you. Danny, her grandmother asked me to look for her. Oh, did she give you the key, did she? Look, that girl's been dead for months and whoever killed her just dumped her down there like she was nothing. I know. I know, Doc. I can handle it from here. Sergeant Parks. Oh, Dr. Sattler, this is Dr... Wallace. Dr. Jack Wallace. How do you do? Well, uh, Dr. Wallace is the police surgeon in... Ballarat. DANNY: Ballarat. And I was wondering if you would mind terribly if I attended at the autopsy. Oh, by all means. I'll be glad for the help. Please follow me. - Wonderful. - Mrs. Wallace, Miss Wallace. Doctor. Dorothy, the pathologist in Melbourne is still trying to determine exactly how she died. Now, I'm afraid this girl is roughly the same height, she's about the same age, and she has an old scar on her lower abdomen. Catherine. She had a hernia operation when she was younger. Oh! Dorothy, I'm... Thank you, Doctor. You want me to do what? If anyone calls from Melbourne for Dr. Wallace, you just... let me know first, yes? Good. Now, anything else you might be able to tell me? Strictly between us, of course. The blood on the towel that was found is the same type as Edward Tyneman's. Right. Toxicology? Confirms that he was drugged. Some kind of sedative. The police locked down the hotel ballroom yesterday. They're collecting bottles and glasses as... Here. He's all yours. Jack, honestly, I'm... I hope you're happy. Officially reinstated? How's that even possible? Oh, I have my suspicions. Are you going to navel-gaze, or are you ready to make yourself useful? Yes. Um, are you still holding Harriet? We are. There were no signs of a struggle, which means that Edward more than likely knew and trusted his killer. But what if he was heavily sedated at the time? And what about the grass and dirt stains in her bed? Well, she's still claiming that she went to look for him in the middle of the night and went back to bed. Well, I suppose if she did, in fact, make her way to the fountain at some point during the night, barefoot, then... The arterial spray on the edge of the fountain, Matthew. Cutting the throat like that, goodness me, it's an extremely violent and, frankly, messy way to kill someone. So what's your point? Say Harriet killed him. She makes her way back to the hotel, she goes up the stairs, changes her clothes after she's washed off all the blood... But doesn't rinse the dirt and grass off her feet? I... ah, I almost forgot. I found this in the fountain. I didn't see Harriet wearing any jewelry featuring sapphires, did you? Well, this could have been in the fountain for God knows how long before Edward was killed. Seems odd no one reported it missing, though. You see, I, um, I asked the staff. And you didn't think to tell me this yesterday? I wasn't police surgeon yesterday. Oh, I almost said it was good to have you back. I'm sorry, Patrick. Lucien's been gone since early this morning. For once, I was actually hoping that he would be home. I need him to prescribe something. Uh, for Susan. Help her sleep. I can always call him at the station. Oh, I'm sure he'll be in touch as soon as he can be. Centerpieces for the wedding? I'm sorry, Patrick. I should move all of that. No, no, no. You deserve to be happy. You've waited long enough. Yes, but a celebration now. Yes, now of all times. We need these moments, these triumphs. Time's a thief, Jean. Don't waste any of the little you have. Until I advise otherwise, you and your daughter are to remain in Ballarat. Uh, for how long? We're not going anywhere. This is our home now, right? Right. I'm just happy she's been cleared. Who's been cleared? You're not seriously letting her go? Come on, Patrick. No need for that. We're family now. Patrick! We are not family! You think I don't know what you're up to? Patrick, come on. I know what you are! Tell me you found something in Melbourne. Well, the Dunnes are known in town. Not well, but well enough. It would appear they come from rather immodest circumstances. Rose went to Births, Deaths, and Marriages. Harriet's details correspond with what we know so far. And the father? Nothing beyond what's listed on her birth certificate. He's a tram driver, or at least he was when she was born. He'd be in his 50s now. So he has no records of his own? Believe it or not, the office was flooded in 1934. I know. I know. A lot of the documentation was destroyed. Well, there you are, you see. He must have known that. He would have been counting on it. Patrick. That's something we can tell the commissioner. He won't listen. I'll make him listen. Why do you think I had them bring you back? You said you were going to help. And I'm trying. But we... we need evidence. We need... we need solid proof. And listen to me, we will find Edward's killer. I promise you. Anything else? Forgive me for asking, but what were you and Edward arguing about the night he died? Goodbye, Lucien. He still thinks Milton Dunne's responsible for all of this. Uh, well, if anyone stands to benefit from Edward's death, it's Milton and his daughter. You spoke with the best man, yes? What's his name? Um, Brian? Well, I'm surprised we could get a complete sentence out of him. He was that hungover. He practically belted Milton right here in the hallway. Is that right? He manhandled a girl at the receptionist as well. Peggy Allen. Apparently, there was an understanding between the parents about her and Edward when they were children. A mutually beneficial marriage. Right. What happened? I don't know, but she wasn't invited to the wedding. She just returned home from Lucerne. Switzerland? Some people have it rough. Peggy. Hello. The housekeeper let me in. I'm Dr. Lucien Blake. I work with the police. I know who you are. Gosh, that's a wonderful piece. I love that particular section. Do... do you know how to play it as a four handed duet? Yes. Let's see if I remember. Um, starts with a C major chord, doesn't it? Da da de da da de da da da da. Big E minor chord at the end there. It's just wonderful. You're not bad. Oh, my mother taught me. You? Lessons. You know, I played this piece with Edward once. We were 15, I think. Is that right? I didn't know he played. Only in front of our fa... families. Right. The police tell me, um... They tell me you've just returned from Switzerland. Yes. I've been reading a lot about Lucerne recently. About the advancements they're making there into cosmetic procedures. You're still recovering from your surgeries, aren't you? You struggled to reach across me just now for that sheet music because your breast tissue is still healing. That little fleck of plaster there on your cheek from the brace you have to wear on your nose while you sleep. He didn't even recognize me at first. And when he did, he called me Piggy. Piggy? Edward made it up when we were younger. Why would anyone ever look twice at fat, disgusting Piggy Allen? Which is why you... Got all this done. The pain... every time it got bad, I'd think about the look on his face when he saw me. The things I'd say in front of everyone. You wanted him to see what he'd missed out on. I wanted them to see who the real pig was just once. But then he threw me out anyway. Not before he kissed me on the cheek and told me... He told me, "You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, Piggy." Peg, I'm sorry. The bloody tissue the police found by the fountain, that was yours, wasn't it? I sat there and I cried for... For I don't even know how long. And then the next morning... Well, it... goodness me. Um, your nose. Are you all right? Should I ask where you got this? Best not to. In your opinion, could that be what was used to sedate Edward? Liquid morphine. It's possible. Goodness me, you've got a lot to be getting on with here. You start on the glassware, I'll take the China. You're telling me that Patrick wants The Courier to cover the story? Better us than The Herald. At least he gets final say on what goes to print. I've already spoken to Harriet, to Peggy Allen, and to the staff at the hotel. Next up is the best man. Brian Underwood. No! Uncle Matthew, I can take care of myself. But Brian Underwood is the kind of bloke that would hit a woman without even thinking twice. If you insist on going to speak to him, you wait for me and I'll come with you, all right? All right? Fine. Can you at least tell me where I can find Milton Dunne? I told you. Just put it on my tab. The Tynemans will take care of all this. Another one of those? I'll take care of it. Here you are. Thank you ever so much. Thank you, Doctor. Ah, not at all. No one should have to drink alone, eh? Ah, thank you. And tell me, how's Harriet doing? Resting at the hotel? Actually, Harriet's decided to move in with the Tynemans. Susan insisted. Apparently she doesn't need her dear old dad anymore. Maybe it'd be easier on everyone if I just left. What will you do? Edward was going to find me a job. Something in the family business. Now... I'll tell you what. There is a tram route through Ballarat. You used to be a tram driver, didn't you? I was. Back in Melbourne. You know, the school I attended in the city when I was a boy... In fact, I was a boarder. I used to love to catch the old tram down Glenhuntly Road to Elwood Beach. Just wonderful. You know the route I'm talking about. I drove it myself enough times over the years. Sure. Really? Goodness me. Driving trams. That's a real salt-of-the-earth kind of job, if you don't mind me saying so. You know, Edward told me about you. Born with your silver spoon. Handed your big house. Your father's practice. That's not exactly how it works, Milton. Oh, yeah? Pay your own way through your fancy boarding school, did you? Now, don't pretend to know anything about our lives, me and Harriet, because you don't! And you never will. You understand? You're quite right, Milton. I apologize. Perhaps I should be going. Yes. Perhaps you should. I do beg your pardon. That tram route closed when I was still a boy. Now, if Milton's around my age, I highly doubt he ever drove it. And so he followed you? Well, someone did. You didn't see how he reacted when I brought up class and money. Matthew, he was absolutely furious. Well, maybe he doesn't enjoy being reminded that he comes from more modest beginnings than some people. Yes. Perhaps. What have you got there? Oh, it arrived this afternoon from your Aunt Dorothy. I didn't think you two spoke. They don't. Well, are you going to open it? No, we're going to send it back. You sure? It might be an early wedding present. And if it's from Dorothy Lucas, it might be worth a bit. I hope not. Maybe this isn't about the money. With Milton, not Dorothy. What if he'd gotten to know the real Edward and was starting to have serious doubts about the marriage? What if he was trying to protect Harriet? If she was my daughter, I'd be terribly concerned. Wondering what a life might be like behind closed doors. Thanks again, Mr. Drury. Oh, here. Let me take that. Ken was supposed to come and help me carry the heavy stuff. Oh, it's my pleasure. You just go and get the car. Sir, what have you done? Patrick. Patrick? Cec, my dear friend, are you all right? Ah, as well as can be expected, sir. Did you know Milton Dunne? No. Right. Well, let's find a nice, quiet spot for you to sit down for a spill, eh? And Cec, two fingers of brandy. Doctor's orders. Come on, Mr. Drury. Let's get you inside. 7:30.100 pounds. Will tell. Dying to know the truth. It's too stained to make out much more than that. Hm. Cause of death is probably the head injury. There's a depressed fracture at the rear of the skull. Characteristics of the wound consistent with the corner of the brick? Yes. There's no chance he fell on it. It was used as a weapon. Yes. I think Mr. Dunne was expecting trouble. I found this hidden in his sleeve. Bloody hell, eh? And, Alice, look here. Faint traces of blood on the blade. Very sharp and serrated. Perhaps this is the weapon that killed Edward Tyneman. So we have a potential murder weapon and a blackmail note. And a suspect found standing over the body. Patrick, I'm worried about you. Well, you needn't be. I'm perfectly fine. Anything you need to tell me? Anything at all? Well, is there anything I can do for you? You... you can tell Susan to, uh, call Lloyd Wellman, our lawyer. Innocent men don't usually ask to have their legal counsel present during these interviews. Patrick, what were you even doing in that alleyway tonight? I was supposed to meet him there at 8:00. I'd like it noted that my client went there solely with the intention of discovering what Mr. Dunne was up to so he could inform the police himself. You were the one who said we needed proof. What did Milton want? What they always want. Money. 100 pounds. That's what the note says, right? We found a note at the crime scene under Milton's body. You don't need to answer them, Patrick. Well, it's not my note. He was also carrying the knife that we think may have been used to murder your son. You suspected him. Superintendent. And he tried to blackmail you. Matthew. So you lured him into a dark alleyway. You bludgeoned him to death with a brick. I'd like a moment to speak to my client, please. Patrick, would you mind terribly, um... Thank you, Mr. Wellman. Well, we let the daughter know. And I found this in Patrick's study. Ah. And this was at the hotel. Milton's speech from the wedding. Right. Well, look at that. Two notes, similar wording. The paper's similar too, but not the same. The tail on the Ys is more curved. Different pressure on the page. So Milton wrote the bloody note we found at the crime scene, but he didn't write the note for Tyneman. Well done, Bill. Top notch. Now, Patrick's blood pressure was through the roof last night. I suspect it still is. Do you know at the moment he can't even do up his shoelaces? In fact, he can't even lean over to pick up my folder. He's weak. He's extremely dizzy. If he bent down to pick up that brick, my guess is he simply would have keeled over. Excuse me, sir. Miss Roslyn Kerr. There's, uh, something she thinks you should know. Go on, miss. I was there last night. You see, we'd run out of gin at the hotel. They never order enough. So I called Mr. Drury and organized to buy a case from him. I saw Mr. Tyneman when I was driving to the Colonists'. He was walking down Sturt Street near the hospital. Roslyn, what time was this? I don't know. A quarter to eight? Really? I remember thinking it was strange, him walking all alone at night. Why didn't you tell us this last night when we questioned you? I told you we shouldn't have come. You can't trust them. I'm sorry. I'd never seen a dead body before. And I wasn't questioned. Last night, I mean. My fault, sir. I... I thought the lass was going to faint right then and there. I was a bit shaky myself, to be honest. Mr. Drury had one of his staff take me upstairs for a cup of tea. And by the time I was feeling better... The police were gone. Yes. Matthew, um, the hospital's, what, about a mile away? Hard to imagine Patrick getting there in time to commit murder, for heaven's sake. We need to find out who Milton was going to meet in that alleyway before Patrick. Well, hello. Do you see anything like, miss? Anderson. Rose Anderson. I'm writing a column for The Courier. A memorium for Edward Tyneman. Yeah. I don't really read the papers. This is a nice car. Yeah, she's a beauty. Are you interested? You've got your bigger windscreen. Updated instrument panel. Four-cylinder engine. 36 horsepower. If you say that's good, then it must be. Mr. Underwood... Brian, please, Rose. Brian. I wanted to offer my condolences for Edward. Yes. Well, it's been difficult, you know? He was a top bloke. Still, life goes on. For some, at least. You don't seem terribly upset. Well, uh, maybe I'm just waiting on the right shoulder to cry on. There's a party tomorrow night. We should go together. You know, so you can make sure I'll be OK. I don't know. I might be busy. How about this, then? I'll give you the price of a lifetime on this car right now, and you meet me tomorrow night at the party in your new chariot. Say 9:00? And maybe I'll throw in a few added bonuses once you get there. Do we have a deal? Patrick? I was hoping to catch you before you left. For your hypertension. I'll quickly get you some water. I'll take them when I get home. Well, this is important. I'm still your physician, aren't I? When it suits you. What were doing walking to the club last night? Why not drive? My car broke down yesterday. Is that a crime now too? I'm only asking... Come on, Patrick. Let's get you home. Mr. Tyneman. Ah, the man I'm looking for. Danny, what brings you here? Well, Auntie Jean reminded me that it was high time I visited Mum when I had some leave. But two birds. Ah. Our Melbourne case. Yeah. Dr. Sattler reckons he's a day away from cause of death and ID on the victim. But? I've been going through the letters that we found at the house. Catherine Lucas owed a lot of money around town. I mean, we're talking thousands of pounds to seven different creditors. I don't know. Maybe she, borrowed money from the wrong person and eventually it caught up to her. Yes, perhaps. I wonder if... Well, look what the cat dragged in. Bill! Good to see you! Yeah. Doc, before you go anywhere, Dr. Harvey's on the phone for you. Right. I'll see you later, Danny. See you. All right, Alice. What do you have there? The blood sample from Milton Dunne's knife. Ah. AB positive. And Edward Tyneman was O negative. So Milton didn't cut Edward's throat. Not with this, he didn't. No. Right. Wait. Where are you going? To meet Jean. Alice, thank you. Harriet. Regarding your father, we, uh... We are so very sorry. Excuse me. Hello, Susan. Jean. Oh, just... just pop it down. Oh, don't... no. Anne-Marie will take it. Susan, I, um... Well, we, wanted to offer our condolences. That's very kind of you, Lucien. Patrick mentioned that you might need something to help you sleep. Now, best not take them with alcohol, eh? Where is Patrick? Patrick? What are you doing? You people must have missed something. Something important. Oh, Patrick. Come on, now. Losing your only son, Lucien, is... It's not just losing a child, it's the end. Of our name. My family legacy is all gone. Patrick, I'm saying this as your doctor and as your friend. You need to go home. You need to rest. Be with Susan. She already blames me. She won't understand. She might if you give her half a chance. Mr. Tyneman, sir? Can I get you are the doctor anything? A brandy maybe? Go away, stupid girl. You feel better now? Oh! What if I do? That sort of carry on is not going to help you, and it certainly won't bring Edward back, and that's the truth of it. You're right. I should have fixed things. I should have done better. I should have done better than my father did by me. I thought we had more time. There's no way you could have known what was going to happen. Really? We weren't as different as he liked to think. God only knows I... I made plenty of mistakes when I was young. But he wouldn't listen. Wouldn't listen to his grumpy old man, just like I wouldn't listen to mine. Sooner or later, we... We all just become our fathers. Do I have to go? Yes. You do, Lucien. I got you something. Expect nothing less at all times. Understood? Yes, sir. It's time. Lucien? Dinner's ready! You did what? I bought a car. I wanted to get some more information out of Brian Underwood, and it saves me from borrowing your old car all the time. He's definitely up to something, but I'm just not sure what. He invited me to this party tomorrow night and I think I might go and just see what else I can dig up. Which part of "Do not go and see Brian Underwood alone" was not clear? I told you I'd be fine. So, this morphine that you pocketed at Peggy Allen's, do we know yet if it was used to drug Edward? Good to see some things around here haven't changed. Good question. We did find one glass. It had this, um, curious, powdery residue in it. Why do I sense a "however" coming on? Liquid morphine wouldn't leave any residue. Mind you, Peggy was taking some other pain medications. Maybe she used one of those. You up to speed there, Danny? Boss? I spoke to your super. You're being seconded here for a few weeks while we're short-handed. Right. Oh, maybe I'll drop in to this party tomorrow night, then. See what Rose's new friend's up to. You read my mind. That was Cec from the Colonists'. He's concerned about Dorothy. Right. We'd better get down there. Excuse us. Jean, that parcel she sent... Do you have it handy? Thank you. Oh! They're beautiful. May I? Yes. It's a very nice gesture. Isn't it? I'll get the car keys. Yes. Ah, sir. Mrs. Beazley. Uh, Mrs. Lucas is just over there. Thank you, Cec. Uh, Mrs. Lucas, I have, uh... I've phoned your nephew. Cec! Wonderful Cecil! Here. Your Christmas bonus. Uh, it's March, ma'am. Oh, please, Cec. I want you to have it. And another gin sour, please and thank you. Yes, ma'am. You're not hungry. I'm here for the company. Well, if it's company you're after, Dorothy, I'll join you. You said it yourself. We're still family. But we're not really family. Your father saw to that. You barely spoke after he married my mother. You shunned him. We tried to tell him, you know. That he was choosing that, girl, over his entire family. Thomas ignored us. And what about after Genevieve died? Not one of you could look beyond the betrayal of him marrying the woman he loved. Thomas never told you! Of course we tried to make amends! For decades I tried. He was my brother, Lucien. My favorite. He refused to so much be in the same room as any of us. He blamed us for the death of your mother almost as much as he blamed himself. He was all alone, Dorothy. And now so am I. I'll be gone soon. Dorothy, nonsense. No. It is true. My Catherine's gone. And these... What is the good of any of it if you've got no one to leave it to? My life will have been meaningless. And now when family is reaching out to you, do you really want to push them away? It's too late! It's never too late. Mrs. Beazley, would you please take me home? Dorothy's going through hell at the moment. Most of which is her own doing, I'm afraid. So it runs in the family, then? Very funny. Although, I am worried, Matthew. I... you've known me forever. You know what I'm like. What if I... Bad husband? Causes endless problems just so he has something to solve? What if I don't deserve her? You don't. But none of that matters. She chose you. God knows why, but she did. And all you have to be is the best version of Lucien Blake you can every day for her. Hm? Yes. But trust me, you step out of line, if you do anything to hurt that woman, I'll kick your ass so hard, you'll wish you'd never saved my leg. You'd do that for me? Oh, I'd do anything for you. Maybe you can accept that just once, everything is going to be all right. His personal effects. Ah. Lucien, I found these in his coat. Yes. For his blood pressure. I gave them to him only yesterday. Are you all right? Yes. We've got work to do. I think I saw him when I was driving home. And you remember what time this was? Just after 10:00. I should have followed him. Maybe I could have done something. Oh, no. You couldn't have done anything, Rose. The car? Didn't belong to Tyneman. We're chasing the rego. I understand that this is difficult for you, Lucien. The cause of death? Alice is still examining the body. He had some heart disease. Some old blood clots in the cardiac atria. - Blood clots? - Yes. Probably related to atrial fibrillation. Um, palpitations. So, similar to the way his father died? Yes. So he didn't die from crashing into the lake? There were superficial injuries from the impact of him hitting the steering wheel, but not water in the lungs, which means he was... He was gone before he, um... Before he entered the lake. Uh, we'll need a report. Yes. Um, about that, Matthew. It is possible to provoke, uh, cardiac arrhythmia. - Blake... - No, no, no. Hear me out. Edward, Milton, now this? You think it's coincidence? Well, I'm sure that Dr. Harvey... Dr. Harvey will find traces of some kind of stimulant. I'm almost certain of it. So you're suggesting that someone wanted Patrick Tyneman dead too? Yes, I am. Who? I'm so sorry. I really should be going. He was always very decent to me, you know, Mr. Tyneman. Harsh but fair. Yes. He was a complicated man. And I wish we hadn't butted heads quite as often as we did. Our poor old bugger. So this is the new car, eh? It's, um... oh, it's a ripper! It's a lemon. It's already cut out on me twice in traffic. Ah. I don't suppose you know a good mechanic? Not really, I'm afraid. Good with medicine. Not so good with motors. What's that? Benzedrine. Um, bennies. Are you sure? I'm fairly sure, yes. You're needed at station, Mr. Underwood. Brian, please, Sarge. Aren't we on a first name basis yet? Now. Yeah, yeah, righto. You mind if I just get out of these? You've got 30 seconds. That's Patrick Tyneman's car. You sure? Yeah. I'd know that car anywhere. What's it doing here? Hey! Mr. Underwood! Hey! Get out of the car! OK. You take that car. We'll cut him off! You go left, I'll go right! Come on! Ah! Get him! Get him! Right! Get out of the car! Out, you! My officers found these hidden in the boot of your car, Brian. I've never seen them before. Really? Yeah. I don't muck around with that stuff. Those things will kill you. The fight you provoked with Milton at the police station the day Edward was found. About it? Dilated pupils, aggressive behavior, unsteady on your feet. You were coming down from bennies, not the bottle. And Milton knew, didn't he? You've got to be joking. We found the note that he sent you, son, in your office. So what? I was meant to meet the dodgy old bugger at the pub a few nights back, but when I got there... You saw him talking to me. And you figured he was telling me the whole story. That's why you followed me. You assumed I was on my way to the police station to spill the beans. You wanted Edward to invest in the drug trade, and he turned you down flat. Milton saw you dealing at the wedding and started blackmailing you. So clearly, he had to go. And then there's Patrick. No, I heard his heart gave out. Yes. Yes, it did. But curiously, he had one of your envelopes in his pocket. And the car that he drove straight into Lake Wendouree belongs to your lot. So why don't you tell us what you know, Brian? You drugged him somehow when he dropped his car off to be repaired. There's no way his heart could have taken that sort of stress. - Blake. - And for what, Brian? Hm? Why? So you could keep peddling pills to bored halfwits like yourself. Blake! He confronted you, didn't he? After all, he was the last person who could blow the whistle, wasn't he? And that... that is why you murdered him. Patrick Tyneman's dead because the bloke never met a double helping of pudding he didn't like. Get outside! That bloody hurt! Get outside! Now! You need to calm down! Oh, arrogant bastard! You're not thinking clearly! And what's that supposed to mean? One victim has his throat cut. Another one gets a brick in the back of the head. A third dies of a chemically induced heart attack. All done by the same bloke? Does any of that make sense to you? No. But I think it's about to. Toxicology? Thank you, Alice. Nothing? No traces of anything that might have artificially induced heart failure. No drugs. No stimulants. Can we run the tests again, please, Alice? I have. Three times. So what was the cause of Patrick's death? An embolic stroke due to atrial fibrillation. A blood clot formed in his heart, which broke off and traveled to the brain. Sometimes people just die. I'm sorry, Lucien. Yes. Thank you, Alice. I can't believe it. I just... Well, I've known Patrick my whole life. Yes. And here's a story for you. Believe it or not, the first time we ever spoke, we wound up arguing. It was after dad's funeral. Patrick had already taken care of a membership at the Colonists' for me. And I said I didn't want it. That I didn't plan on staying in Ballarat long enough to use the bloody thing. Well, you were still grieving. He would have known that. But I'll be the first to admit, you're far easier to live with now than you were back then. Yes, I suppose I am. Jean, my darling, I... I hate to say it, but, I think we may have to postpone the wedding. No, we can't. Jean... I promised Patrick. He said we can't wait. Not for anything. It was the last thing he said to me. But so much has happened since then. Yes, it has. And I'm more than a little inclined to agree with you, but knowing Patrick, I think he'd be more upset if we didn't respect his wishes. Don't you? Susan. Look at those eyes, huh? Everyone always said how much he looked like his father. But those eyes came from my side of the family. I'm so sorry about Patrick, Susan. If there's anything Lucien and I can... He sent you to Melbourne, didn't he? What for? He asked Lucien to look into the Dunnes. To ask some questions. To talk to people who... who knew them. Perhaps if he'd taken more of an interest in Edward when he was alive, none of this would have happened. He loved his son. He loved you, Susan. Very much. Patrick loved a lot of women over the years. Edward's wedding photos. They're not very good, are they? Our photographer cancelled on the day. Patrick had to call in some boy from the newspaper. He was always very good at that sort of thing. Taking care of things. Your chap at The Courier, did he happen to mention why the wedding photographer cancelled? No. So I tracked him down, and it turns out that he didn't cancel. He received a phone call that morning from the father of the bride telling him that his services would no longer be required. Why on earth would Milton cancel the photographer? I'm guessing the answer is somewhere in here. I knew it! Look at that! It's exactly the same pose. I think it's much more than that. I don't know. It... this might be Catherine Lucas. Might not be, though. It's hard to tell from these. Sorry. Thank you for your time. One more thing, if I may. Catherine Lucas, when she did visit, would she come alone? If memory serves me, she used to come in with some old bloke. I just assumed it was her dad. Right. Thank you. For Dr. Wallace. Thank you, Danny. Right. She was murdered. Mm. Stabbed in the abdomen and left to die. And I think we might know who did it. Uh, Doc, best let me take the lead on this. Danny! You did this! I know you want me dead too! - No! No! Hey! Harriet! It's all right. She killed my boy! That's it. Breathe for me. My baby! The baby! We know about the sting you were running in Melbourne, Harriet. Several witnesses have confirmed that you were posing as Catherine Lucas. And why would I do that? Well, "Regarding the money we loaned you," "We've not heard from you in some time," "Wondering when you'll repay us." "I gave you and your father money in good faith." All of these letters were amongst Catherine's recent mail. So? Well, interestingly, Catherine's father died in Crete almost 20 years ago. Was that all that Edward Tyneman was to you? Just another soft target? I loved my husband. And he loved me. Did he know about the baby? Of course he did! Edward promised me that we would never have to worry about anything again. Well, I don't know what Edward told you, but his father cut him off from the family businesses. All of them. Patrick was sick, Doctor, and Edward knew that. He was going to force a vote by the company to have his father replaced. There's no way he would have gotten away with that. Would he? Not without help. Hang on a moment. The lawyer. Wellman. That's what they were up to. And the only ones who knew were Edward, Wellman, and yourself, of course. And your father... He let it slip to me accidentally that Edward promised him a job. He... my father... Was the only one who knew what you were up to. Your little grift in the city. The plan to overthrow Patrick. And once Edward was gone, one little slip up like the one with the good doctor and he could have ruined everything. My father is dead! I didn't murder anyone! I don't believe you, Miss Dunne. It is Mrs. Tyneman. Oi! Come on! So you fingerprinted Harriet? Yes. And took blood. I'm fairly certain this report will confirm that she's telling the truth about being pregnant, if nothing else. There's something I don't get. Harriet marries Edward. He's going to take over the family business, so she and her father will be set for life, and then Milton goes and risks it all by blackmailing a car salesman for 100 pounds? Mm. Harriet didn't need him anymore. I'd say he was just trying to make some quick cash so he could clean up and disappear. Oh! Speaking of, why are you two to tidying up the studio now? The studio. Yes. It's, um... My bedroom's upstairs, Lucien's is at the front of the house, and, um, they're both rather small. Very small, aren't they? And... which means that I... - We. - We. So uncle Matthew thinks that Harriet killed her own father just to stop him from talking. Unless he wasn't. Her father, I mean. Well, they've both lied about everything else. How can we be sure that they're even related? Yes. Ah. Sergeant. Very good timing. I think Lucien here might need a hand moving some furniture. Thank you, Rose. Danny. Has Harriet confessed? Uh, no, but, uh, the girl you found In Melbourne. Not Catherine Lucas, is it? The victim's name is Elsie Denton. 21 years old. Dental records match. She had a, uh, lower abdominal scar from a childhood appendectomy. Yes. I should let Dorothy know. I'll take care of that. Thank you, Jean. So where's the real Catherine? And who in God's name is Elsie Denton? She's my sister. Your sister had a very rare blood type, Harriet. AB positive. Same as yours. It matches the blood we found on Milton's knife. You stabbed your sister with this then left her to die in that cellar. - Danny! - No! No! No! No! Get me out of here! Get me out! It's all right! It's all right! It's all right. Come. Come. Sit. Sit with me. Sit with me. Sit with me. That's it. That's it. I'm right here. I'm right here, Harriet. Harriet, look at me. Look at me. Milton wasn't your father, was he? No. No. We were a team. Me, Milton, and Else. We had been for a while. One of the deals that we had was, um, at an asylum in Sydney. I asked you about medical experience, didn't I? You posed as a nurse, yes? I'd gather all the sensitive information for the older patients, and Milton and Else would show up pretending to be long lost relatives. They'd sign away pretty much anything. Last year, I saw a patient that I recognized from a scam that we'd done on the Sydney set. Catherine Lucas? Yeah. And, Harriet, that's when you came up with a new plan, yes? You moved to Melbourne and posed as Catherine. And then you ran into Edward, who knew the real Catherine from Ballarat. What are the odds, right? My Edward. Harriet? And Elsie? Milton said she bolted with all our savings. Bastard. They were always at each other. I should have known. All right. Harriet, listen to me. What happened to Catherine? Well, she got transferred. Doesn't matter though. Last time I saw her, she didn't even know who she was. She's gone. You're here on behalf of Mrs. Tyneman. Mrs. Harriet Tyneman, yes. Mrs. Susan Tyneman has asked me to expedite her release. The girl faces charges of theft, obtaining goods under false pretenses, extortion, conspiracy, and... Then charge her. We are more than happy to proceed to the courts. This isn't about Harriet, though, really, is it? This is about Edward's unborn child... If, in fact, we can even be sure of the paternity. Various procedures have been scheduled. Uh, blood tests and so on. Uh, we've engaged a forensic scientist. I see. Spoken like someone who's had experience with this sort of thing. Well, this is not the first time we've done this, Doctor. So, uh, unless there's anything else, the girl needs her rest before the funerals tomorrow. Funerals? My client has requested that both her husband and her son be buried together. And as Patrick died of natural causes, there's no legal reason for his body to remain at Ballarat Hospital. Perhaps Susan was right. Maybe Patrick driving his son away is what caused all this to happen. Well, I think poor old Patrick was probably at the end of his tether, given everything the boy had done over the years. I don't know. It's such a mess. Certainly is. Ah. I found these earlier. From my father. Did you know? I knew that he wrote to you quite often and that every letter was returned to sender. You know, I've been thinking about him a lot lately. By the time I got back, towards the end, he couldn't talk. He couldn't... Well, he couldn't communicate at all, in fact. I remember. The last time we really spoke was a few years before the war. I came home to tell him that I'd just gotten engaged. He told me to break it off. Oh, Lucien. Yes. He said, um... He said I stood to lose everything and everyone I ever loved. And that I probably chose this "foreign girl" just to spite him. We both said things. Dreadful things that we could never take back. In fact, he said to me... He said, Lucien, if you leave, don't ever bother coming back home. Which is why I spent 20 years returning his letters unopened and unread. "All I've ever hoped for is that you would do your best and that you would find someone to love you regardless of what happened next. I miss you, son. I miss you. Thomas Blake." He only sent you away to protect you. Knowing that here and here, it's two very different things. And I hated him for the longest time. And then I remember... I remember feeling strangely afraid. Of what? Afraid that if I ever came back to this town, I'd end up just like him. And now? Is that such a bad thing? No, I don't think it is. Not anymore. For as the father has life in himself, so he has granted the son also to have life in himself. And he has given him the opportunity to execute judgement because he is the son of man. Do not marvel at this, for an hour will come when all will exit the tomb upon hearing his voice. Yes. Thank you. Oops! You all right? She's only just worked it out, hasn't she? Susan's going to be raising the kid herself. Make the same mistakes all over again. Harriet's trapped. It's about time the past caught up to her. God knows I made plenty of mistakes when I was a young man. Something Patrick said to me the night he died. And yesterday, Wellman said it wasn't the first time he arranged for tests to be carried out. I assumed he was talking about Edward. You think Patrick might have been the one who was seeing someone? But if this is about revenge, then why kill Edward? Why not just go after Patrick? Because it would hurt him? Send some kind of message? Or maybe... Maybe because he pushed you away. How long have you known, Roslyn, that Patrick was your father? I've always known. My mother was an actress in Melbourne. She caught his eye one night. This rich stranger who showed up backstage with flowers. He sent money every month through his lawyer, but I was never a real Tyneman. He had his son. That was all he cared about. No, I rather suspect he cared more than you realize. That’s why he named you after his mother. And why he sent you her bracelet. He sent this to my mum for me. A parting gift. He told his lawyer to tell us that if we ever tried speaking to Mr. Tyneman again, he'd do everything in his power to ruin us. I'm guessing that was Mr. Wellman's decision, not your father's. Now, you spotted Edward's wedding announcement in the newspaper, didn't you? The prodigal son. Handed everything he could ever want on a silver platter, only to throw it back in people's faces. And that's why you decided to kill him. I almost didn't, you know. I was having second thoughts. And then I heard him scheming with that lawyer about how they were going to betray my father. He was exactly what I always thought he was. Tell me this. How did you get him outside? I told him what he wanted to hear. That I knew something that could ruin his father and make him very, very rich. By the time he showed up, I'd spiked so many of his drinks with Nembutal that he could barely stand. And the rest... Well, it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. And Milton? He knew my mother from a panto they were both in. He must have known it was more than a coincidence me being there, so he tried to blackmail me after Edward's death. Old men. They always underestimate young women. Milton sent you the note we found with the body. The one about meeting at 7:30. And Roslyn sent the note to Patrick telling him to be at the Colonists' at 8:00. You lured him there so you could be his airtight alibi. The savior in his hour of need. All you ever wanted was your father's love. And you just wanted to hear him say he was sorry. He should have been a part of my life. But he is. He is, Roslyn, and he always will be. The reason you've been feeling faint, the fluttering in your chest... A symptom of a particular condition. A condition your father had that Edward had too. And that... that's your inheritance, Roslyn. Now, come. It's over. Bloody hell! Hey! Don't! Drop it! Drop it! You all right? Yes. Blake! Are you all right? Jean won't be pleased. Not much farther. We're nearly there. Do watch your step. I'm not a complete invalid. I know. There. That's... that's my Catherine. How? Well, Mrs. Beazley and Rose Anderson. They called every institution in New South Wales and Queensland. We found her about a week ago just outside of Newcastle. I had her transferred here. I think it's going to help her enormously to know she has a family close by. As do you, Auntie Dorothy. All right, now. That's enough. Lucien. Thank you. It's time. I have waited for you for such a long time. You look beautiful. Are we ready? Yes. Welcome, everyone. We are gathered here today to marry this man and this woman. I am duly authorized by law to solemnize this, your marriage, for you, Jean Beazley, and you, Lucien Blake, are joined together in marriage. And the rings, please. Very funny. I, Lucien Redcliffe Blake. Take thee, Jean Mary Beazley. Take thee, Jean Mary Beazley. As my lawful wedded wife. As my lawful wedded wife. To have and to hold from this day forward. For better or for worse, for richer or poorer. To love and to cherish till death do us part. I do pronounce you husband and wife. Hi. You made it. It's lovely to see you. - Yeah. - Hi. We have to catch up. Yeah. All right. Enjoy your night. Thank you. Charlie! You know, I think I understand all of this a little better now. The big wedding. All of these people celebrating together. Well, how about we go outside and get some air? Oh, God, yes. Ladies and gentlemen, may I claim your attention? Would you please welcome to the floor for their first dance together Dr. and Mrs. Blake. Mrs. Blake. Shall we? Home, sweet home. I'll pop the kettle on. That'd be lovely. I'm sorry, Jean. Oh, bloody hell! I'm afraid you're needed at the station. Off you go. You've got work to do. Oh, and, uh, welcome back, by the way. I love you.
