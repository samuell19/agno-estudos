Lookin' good, Sarah. You make that look too easy. Thanks, Chad. Hey, I got somethin' for you. No shit! This got ripped off my helmet on a skydive yesterday. And survived! I just found it in the landing area. - You're welcome. - Thanks. That was a pretty sick landing, Sarah. Thanks. - Did you enjoy your solo? - I did. You know, you'd have a lot more fun jumping with us. So you keep telling me. Just 'cause you're the new girl doesn't mean you can't make friends. You should come out with us some time. Is that your way of asking? Well, yeah, I'm not not-asking. Wow, I can't say I've ever heard that line before. You're not gonna make this easy on me. Where's the fun in that? - You mind if I leave this here for Kris? - Yeah, no doubt. That was classic. I've never seen Payson get shut down before. I don't think it's ever happened, to be honest. Just another cocky Skygod. Every drop zone has one. You done with that packing weight? Um, yup. Who was that? That's Kris. He's been packing parachutes a long time. - Does he jump? - Used to. They say he was pretty bad-ass back in the day. Guess he decided to quit while he was ahead. Load 5, gear up. You're on five-minute call. Load 5. Dude, give it up. It's never gonna happen. I'm with Wade. She's never gonna come around. You've been trying to get her to jump with us since she got here. What's so special about her, anyway? You don't know who that is? Skydiving runs in that girl's blood. We need a sixth, Lisa. And she's the one. Whatever. - Payson! - Sorry, sorry. - I have a confession to make. - Oh? Since when do they allow women into the priesthood? I need something from you. I just know talent when I see it, and right now, the team could use you. You ever heard of the phrase, "I don't want to belong to any club that would have me as a member?" Yeah, Groucho Marx. You get points for knowing that. Doesn't change the fact that I like to jump alone. Jumping alone is kind of like masturbating. It'll do in a pinch, but it's kinda depressing. Maybe you don't masturbate right. Mm-hmm? A group of us are going to church later. You ever been? What self-respecting girl hasn't been to church a few times? So I'll see you there? I'll say... maybe. They missed you. They're just ducks, Mom. They don't miss me. You like it? It's a new blend I've been working on. Yeah. It's like a mix between tree bark and peat moss. It's healthy. Just drink it. It's good to have you back. It's good to be back... I think. I was hoping we could fix things. I would like that. Look, before you left, I let my emotions get the best of me. I was angry. I hope you can understand that. Are you still jumping? We're talking about fixing things, and that's where you want to go? I'm staying safe, Mom, don't worry. What I worry about is you moving from place to place, all by yourself. You don't stick around in one place long enough to make any friends. I got invited to hang out with some people tonight. Well, good. I hope you're gonna go. I haven't decided. Sarah... you should go. You need it. There she is. Ah, shit. Thanks a lot. Guess that means I'm going first. Nice to meet you, too. That's Greg. He bet me you wouldn't show. I think he's got a little crush. That's Evan. - Yo. - Hey. - Wade, Lisa. - 'Sup. What is she doing here? Come on, Lisa, church is for everyone. Yeah, I still don't get why they call this church. 'Cause this is where you go to pray for your life. Damn, dude, that's dark. Welcome to church, Sarah. - Yeah! - Whoo! He cheats death again. Whoo-whoo. So, uh, I hear you might be joining us for some formation jumps tomorrow. I don't know about that. I've never done any formation jumps before. What? What do you do when you skydive? What, do you just play "Princess of the Sky" up there all by yourself? I guess I've just always kept to myself. I like it that way. I wonder if other people like it that way, too. So, listen, uh, now that we finally have six people... I think we should try "The Hex." You guys gonna jump or what? That seems like a bad idea, but what do I know? Let's go, Wade. See ya. Bombs away. Whoo! Go, go, go! - Ooo! - - Hurry up and land, Wade. Coming in hot, Lisa. So, hey... - The Hex? - Yeah. For real? I mean, come on. I'd expect this from Wade, but not you. It's just... I mean, we've all heard the stories. I mean, you believe every story you hear at the drop zone? Hey, trust me. Have I ever steered you wrong? Okay. Have a good jump, Sarah. Thanks. Whoo. Whoo! Listen, I didn't mean to assume anything. I know you haven't agreed to jump with us. And I'm sorry I said jumping alone was lame. Uh, it's okay. I'm sorry I questioned your masturbating skills. So, what's the Hex? It's this jump I've always wanted to do, but you need six people. - Six talented people. - Ah. What do you say? See you in the morning. Whoo. This jump? It's true, you need six people. But the reason it's called the Hex is a couple of people have died trying it. Seriously? That's just an urban legend. Nobody's ever died doing the Hex. We can do something else if you're uncomfortable, Sarah. You could just film us. I'm not much of a bystander, Lisa. Thanks, though. That's what I'm talking about! No, not the white board! I hate the white board. Yes, Wade. I know you do, and I thought you might have a hard time visualizing this particular jump. So here... I made this just for you. Ooh. - Really? - We fly like this, and on my key... Key... huh? Hardy-fucking-har. Fuck me, this actually does help, though. Just try not to... Oh, my God. Oh, my God, baby. Oh, no, don't do it. Remember, a collision at these speeds can knock you out cold. Err on the side of caution. We all have to die. But we don't have to die today! That's right, smart asses. Gear up. Looks like your altimeter's sticking. Yeah, it does that sometimes. It's all right. My eyes can be my altimeter. I really don't think Sarah should be center. It's her first time doing any kind of formation, and you're putting her right in the most dangerous slot. She'll be fine. Try thinking with your other head? If anything happens to her, it's gonna be your fault. Um, hi, guys. You know, I'm sitting right here. Don't let her rattle you. Lisa can be a little over dramatic at times. Eat a dick, Greg. You'll be great. Yeah, and if you really want to be great, you can flash the pilot your boobs, and he'll give us some extra altitude! In your dreams. All right, everybody on comms! - Let's do this! - Aw, yeah. Hey, Payson, what's the capital of Thailand? What? - Bang Cock! - Never gets old. Ow, fucker. Just get in the damn door, Evan. Let's get it on. Ready, set, go! Nice and easy, Sarah. Nice and easy yourself. I am in my slot. Okay, looking good, everybody. Watch your levels. Ready... and... key! Oh, shit, I'm losing it. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Fuck! Shit! What the hell?! Well, guys, that sucked. Break off. Break off. Everybody good? - Greg's fine. - Roger. - Go for Wade. - Sarah's good. Is she, though? All right, see you guys on the ground. Whoo. How'd it go? Good enough. We can do better, though. Here she comes. She's coming. She's coming. Sorry about that, guys. My foot clipped Wade's head, and I-I kinda bugged out. Hey, hey, no sweat. I got somethin' for ya. Homie hat! Ah, don't worry about it. It's like a skydiving dunce cap. - Yeah, it is. - We've all been there. - Looks good on her. - Was that seriously your first formation? Why, so you can make a bunch of virgin jokes? I told you that last night. No, because if it really was your first time, then that means... Sarah's buying! So, are you stoked on that jump or what? Yes. I mean, it-it does suck that I messed it up, but... maybe I shouldn't expect much on my first try. Nah, don't even sweat it. This crew's been jumping together a while now. If I had a dollar for every jump that I fucked up, I could pay for this beer... ...and some pizza. - Who's that? - My mother. If she knows I've been out jumping and hasn't heard from me by sunset, she tends to assume the worst. Why's that? Did you have a friend go in or something? Something like that. Somebody close to you? Yeah. Is that why you jump alone? That's part of it. I've only been jumping a couple of years. I never had a friend die skydiving. You will. Eventually, we all do. All right, guys. Now listen up. Hang on. Wait a second. All right, so I want to run the Hex again tomorrow. This time, with no mistakes. I think we can all agree that we put a little too much stress on Sarah by putting her in the middle. I think we can also agree that somebody already tried to tell you that. Which is why I'm going to be taking the center. - Whoo! - Sarah... You'll be right here across from me. Evan... you're right here. Greg... you'll be right here between Lisa and Wade. Guys, if this was easy, everyone would do it. Get some rest, and I'll see you at the ass-crack of dawn. All right, see you, Payson. Whatever. Wade, come on, let's go. I guess we're leaving. I'm riding with you. I'm out, bro. Lisa, wait up. She loves me. Don't take it too personally. Lisa's just jealous. And she doesn't have a terribly high emotional IQ. That's stupid. She's just as good a skydiver as I am. Not that. Payson. Are they a thing? Used to be. Lisa still wants them to be. But that was never gonna work out. They don't seem exactly compatible. She's fucking crazy! Oh, good. You take the bad with the good, I guess. She deals with enough of our shit, that's for sure. See ya dark and early. Hey. You want a beer? Much obliged. I saw you guys tried the Hex today. Yeah, but I fucked it up. Obviously. No shame in that. The Hex is a tough formation. Maybe a handful of people in the world that could pull it off. Have you seen it done? I have. Trying it again tomorrow. Wow! Good luck. Thanks. Do you know how bad those things are for you? Yeah, well, we're all gonna croak sometime. Yeah, but taurine overdose seems like a pretty stupid reason. Yeah, well, you die your way, cupcake. I'll die mine. All right, skydive! Whoo! Oh! How's it going, Jerry? Payson! How you doing, man? Not quite as well as you, by the looks of things. And what's your name? Her name's Ingrid. Only speaks a few words of English. Ingrid, huh? You lucky bastard. Come on, let's load up. Good morning, L.A. center, jump 2 is lighting up. We'll be climbing at 12,000 feet this mornin'. Appreciate any advisories. Jump 2, L.A. center, good morning. Advise when you're wheels up. Expect clear skies from one to two thousand. Be advised moderate to severe turbulence reported all the way to 15,000 feet. Buckle up, jump 2. It's gonna be a bumpy ride. Copy that. We're rolling. Hey, Jer, what about getting a little extra altitude, huh? I'm not askin' her. Hey, Ingrid, do you want the plane to go higher? Yeah, Ingrid, have a longer skydive? Yeah, sure. Okay. All you have to do is... Show the boobs to the pilot, and he'll take us up an extra thousand feet. I-I wouldn't lie to you. Yo, Andy! Ingrid wants to show you something! Sorry about that, folks! I think the man upstairs gave us some turbulence just to make those beautiful titties bounce! I'd say that's definitely worth some extra altitude! What'd I miss? Crouch down for me. Here we go! Ready, steady, go! All right, guys. Here we go. Ready, set, go! All right, guys, here we go. Ready... key! And key! Come on, guys, you got it. Come on, don't let go. Holy shit, we did it. Yeah. Yeah, you! Ha-ha! All right! Yeah! Whoo! That's what I'm talking about! Yeah! Awesome! We got it guys! Holy shit, that was bad-ass. Good job, guys. Good shit. What the fuck just happened? - Did I just fucking see that? - - Oh, my God! - What the fuck, man? - Does anyone see him? We gotta go. We gotta go. Break off! Evan, do you see him anywhere? I don't see his parachute. I don't see him. - Where's Payson? - I don't know. - Where the hell is he? - He's gone. All of a sudden, he was just gone! Guys, guys. It was like he was there one second, and then he wasn't. He must have pulled early. If he pulled early, we'd be able to see his canopy. Unless it didn't open. - Disappeared? - Yeah. Bill, I know how this sounds, but I saw what I saw. Guys, I've owned this drop zone for 22 years. Nobody has ever just disappeared. But that's what happened. Here's what we'll do. I'll grab a bunch of people. We'll get them out in their cars searching for him. We'll find him on the side of the road packing his parachute. Somebody should call the cops, or the paramedics or whatever. Man, we don't even know if he's injured. He could be stuck in a tree somewhere or landed in someone's backyard. Right. I can drive. I can help look. - I'll go with you. - All right, let's go. It's just... I consider myself a rational person, and I'm having a really hard time with this. I mean, what did you see? I saw what you saw. I guess it's possible he could have just... I don't know, had some sort of canopy malfunction and had to cut away. I just feel like one of us would have seen something. That's my worst nightmare. Having to cut away. - You never had to? - Nope. Not that big of a deal, really. I mean, when it happens, it's like time slows way down. You know what I mean? And then you just... Pull your cut-away handle to lose the mess, pull your reserve handle to save your life. Everyone has to do it, sooner or later. There's a part of me that just wishes it would happen. Then maybe it wouldn't scare me so much. It wakes me up at night. My canopy malfunctions, and for whatever reason, I can't control it. I can't cut away. I used to have dreams like that. Used to? Now I have nightmares we're about to crash. I'm stuck inside the plane and can't get out the door. Hey, stop here. If we don't find him soon, the chances of finding him at all are gonna be pretty slim. Damn it, Payson. Where the hell are you? Come on. We covered as much as we could. There's no sign of him. All right, copy that. Andy circled with a spotter 'til it got dark. They didn't see anything. - And the cops? - Nothin'. They're waiting inside. Sarah, they want to talk to you. Yeah, that's, uh, pretty much what I heard from everyone else. Now, I have to ask. Did any of you partake in any controlled substances when you went up? We weren't high, if that's what you're asking. Okay. Well, maybe it was an alien abduction. Maybe a UFO swooped in and scooped him up with a tractor beam. You think this is funny? Not at all. He could be dead or... or dying out there somewhere, and you're sitting here cracking jokes? Maybe. Or maybe... I don't know, he's sipping Mai Tais in Palm Springs. What do you think? What the hell are you talking about? Look at the video! Oh, I have them all right here. How about this video? This one? What about this one? Your friend's not on any of these videos. He may very well be missing. But something about your story's not checking out. Get up. Another point for me. I shut her down again. Oh! Payson? Jesus fucking Christ! Payson, what the... Get up! What the fuck? Shit! Hurry. Open the door. Payson! Oh, my God! Payson. That's the dumbest story I ever heard. You had a bad dream last night because of what happened yesterday. That's it. I didn't sleep great last night either. This is more than just a bad dream, Lisa. Show her. This is Payson's, isn't it? Just found it on the ground last night. What the fuck, Wade? How do you have his altimeter? I don't know. I'm pretty sure he had it on the jump yesterday. Yeah, he definitely had it. I remember because I noticed it was sticking the other day. It was stuck on zero. Well, you guys jump if you want to. I'm out of here. She's fine. She'll be back tomorrow. What do you think, Evan? You've been pretty quiet. Payson. Do we think he's dead? And if he is, who did you guys see last night? All right, look. We still don't know what happened to Payson. But whatever happened, he's not haunting us. I didn't think you guys would make it in today. Well, we're all about getting back on the horse. - All right. Be safe out there. - Will do. It's our own fault, you know? - For trying the Hex. - Come on, a cursed skydive? Are you kidding me? It wasn't the formation, and we don't even know for sure Payson's even dead. I'm sure. I saw him last night, too. Only he said something to me. What'd he say, dude? He said, "You're next, Evan." Like next, next? Guys, okay. May-maybe Lisa's right. We're probably just suffering from some sort of post-traumatic stress or something. You guys want to make a plan or what? No. I'm doing a solo. Think you can catch me? With one arm tied behind my back. I'll even give you a head start. Oh, come on, Evan. You got to make me work for it a little bit. Evan? Come on, Evan, stop playing around. Evan? This isn't funny. Evan? Evan? Evan! Oh, my God! Evan! Come on! Come on, Evan! No! Shit! Evan! Evan, I'm gonna jump you out. Come on, wake up. Come on, wake up! Come on! Evan, you've got to fly your parachute. Evan, can you hear me? Come on, Evan, you've got to wake up. Evan! Oh, God, Evan! Oh! Shit! Guys, help! - Sarah! - What happened? - Is he okay? - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Fuck! Help! Oh, my God! What the fuck?! Hey! Evan! Hey, hey! His heart isn't beating. Evan! Oh, man, this is bad. Holy shit. He's not breathing. - Dude, he's not breathing. - Evan! Wade went to tell Lisa what happened. You did everything you could. The paramedics said it was cardiac arrest. He was probably dead before he even hit the ground. Cardiac arrest? Doesn't sound very likely, does it? How long have you been jumping, Greg? About five or six years. Why? And have you ever heard of anything like this happening before? To someone his age? No. Is this who I think it is? That's me and my Dad. That's the last picture we ever took together. I've just heard so many awesome stories about him. Yeah. There's a lot of those. He designed some of the best free fly formations ever. He's a legend. I take it he's the reason you started skydiving? Yeah. He and his friends made it look so cool, you know? Even when I was little, I wanted to be just like him. I'm sure he'd be proud of you. I wish my mom thought that way. After I made my first jump, I think she was ready to disown me. I think that's a typical reaction from a mom, though, isn't it? It was more than just that. So I left. Yeah, and now you're back. Yeah. Great timing, huh? I don't think these last two days have even hit me yet. It's not going to be easy when it does. I just can't believe what's happened. That was... unexpected. - Are you complaining? - Not at all. So, what took you so long to jump with us? It's not that I didn't want to. It's just... I've never been good at making friends. Why not? If I don't let anyone get close... I can't leave anyone behind. Shouldn't you let the people who want to get close to you decide whether or not they want to take that chance? Maybe. But there's also the flip side. When somebody dies at the drop zone, it's easier if it's... just some guy. Harder when it's your friend... like Evan. Or Payson. Listen, what happened to Evan was just bad luck. And yeah, the timing is a little weird, I admit. But we're gonna find out what happened to Payson. And if he's dead? Then at least he died doing something that he loved. That's such a fucking cop-out. Don't you think that Evan would be happy to never make another skydive if it meant that he could still be alive? Hurry! Open the door. - Sarah! - Greg! Greg, open the door! Oh, my God! Don't seem to have much luck with the fellas, do you? Two dead guys and one missing in so many days. - And? - And I'm just saying. Doesn't exactly paint you in the most flattering light. Listen... I don't think that you did this. But it did happen under your roof. Are you sure there's nothing else you want to tell me? I've told you everything. I'll be in touch. Lisa! - You happy now? - What the hell is your problem? You! You're everyone's problem! All of this started when you came to the drop zone! You show up. First Payson disappears, Evan has a heart attack, Greg goes home with you and somehow manages to break every bone in his body in the middle of the night. I don't know what your deal is, but there is something very wrong with you. Come on, Lisa. Just take it easy. Take it easy? Fuck easy! How do you explain it, Wade? I don't know! El Niño? Stay the hell away from me. Let's go, Wade. Are you fucking serious? She's not the bad guy here, Lisa. Keep telling yourself that. You okay? I need to get the hell out of this house. What's up, guys? What are you doing here? Two. What else are you gonna do when no one wants to jump? Guess we're in the right place, then. Sarah, you okay? Dude, Lisa went off on her. Told her that she was a jinx, said that everything that happened was her fault. That's stupid. I know, right? That's what I told her. - It's not you, Sarah. - Mm-mm. It's the Hex. Oh, come on, Andy! Not this horseshit again. - Hey! - No. I can't name one team, not one, that's done it and is still alive. And I've been here a while. I mean, heck, Kris, you've been here longer than I have. Can you? Nope. Okay, look, I'm-I'm as superstitious as anyone. I touch the wing of the plane before I get in, I-I-I don't take pictures before I jump, but I don't believe in any stupid Hex curse. Come on! That's what Payson said when I asked him not to do it. He laughed at me. He said, "Don't put that bad juju in people's heads." He said you'd mess up the jump. So, I kept my mouth shut. You could have said something. Would you have listened? That's the problem with you guys. I mean, just the idea of death makes things more enticing. Oh, come on, Andy! It sounds like total bullshit to me. Where... where are you going? To find out if we're cursed or not. Are you coming? When you said that we were gonna find some spiritual help, I thought you meant hire an exorcist or something. Why? It's not like we're being possessed. Okay, that's a good point. I'm not very flexible. Just FYI. Thanks, Dianne. Sarah? Are you okay? What's going on? Hi, Mom. This is my friend, Wade. - Hmm. - You got a minute? Um... of course. You guys come on back. What did the police say? Nothing. Guy's worthless. I think I'm their prime suspect, if that tells you anything. We need some help, Mom. Well, I'm not sure I can be much help, but... let's start by centering ourselves. Find a comfortable seated position, something you can hold for a while. You can lie down, if that's easier. Ah! This is good. Close your eyes and try to relax, breathing easily and deeply... repeating the Sanskrit mantra So Hum in your mind. So on the inhale, Hum on the exhale. So... hum. Yo, Andy! Ingrid wants to show you something! What the fuck was that? Everybody out! Open the door! What happened? Did I pass out? You didn't just pass out. You had like a full-on seizure. What did you see? It was the day we did the Hex. The last time we saw Payson. Only it was different. Something went wrong with the plane. Mom? What's wrong? What is it? It's, uh... it's just been a long time since I've heard that name. What name? The Hex. Wait, why does your mom know the Hex? - How do you know the Hex? - Mom? After your father died, people watched the video of his death over and over again to see what went wrong. But it was just an accident. It wasn't anyone's fault. Sarah, if she's saying that your dad died doing the Hex, I'm gonna flip my shit! What I'm saying... is it wasn't always called the Hex. Your father never called it the Hex. They only started calling it that after the other deaths. The unexplained ones. Unexplained deaths? All but one of your father's team. And the other teams stupid enough to try it. They didn't all necessarily die on a skydive, but it never ended well. Eventually, it just became... the thing that people talked about around a bonfire. Why didn't you ever tell me any of this? You had a hard enough time dealing with your father's death. I thought I was protecting you. Take this. Why? To meditate? Just tell me what the hell we're supposed to do now. I wish I could. So? So what? So, what do you think? Are you sure that your mom's not some New Age weirdo? Talking about things from like ten years ago? That can't be what's happening. Do you really believe that? Next time, we go to the exorcist. Bet those solo skydives look really good right about now. Nah. Jumping alone all those years... I was missing out. I'm glad we're in this together. Fuckin' A. Can't make it alone. I wish Lisa were here right now. Why, so she could knock some teeth out this time? No, I just feel... I feel bad. She's part of the team. You know, whatever's left of it. I just feel like we should stick together, you know? I told you not to come near me. Look, we wanted to warn you. About what? You-you might need this. They-they are beads, you know? Like beads. I think the plane was supposed to crash the day we did the Hex. Is that right? And maybe it was supposed to crash because we did the Hex. So, you're basing this on a vision you had while doing yoga? - Yeah. - Wow. And you, Wade? I was just kinda lyin' there. Okay. Well, forgive me if I don't take it all that seriously. Nothing strange has happened to you, Lisa, since Payson disappeared? Shit! Are you okay? I'm fine. Listen, I've heard enough. So, thanks for checking in, but I'm good. You should go. Lisa, come with us. You shouldn't have to do this by yourself. None of us should be alone. All I am doing is looking for a little peace and quiet. Please. Lisa... Lisa... Now you... Lisa... Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa... Leave me alone! There's definitely something she's not telling us. So now what? Wade. How's our favorite Sheriff? He says I'm a person of interest in an ongoing case, and now I'm not supposed to leave town. What the fuck are we gonna do, Wade? Look, I knew that your turn in there was gonna take longer than mine, and so I found myself back at the bar. Well, have you ever looked at any of the old pictures hanging on the wall in there? Yeah, yeah, I guess. Why? Well, I don't know, I never really paid attention until today. I found this hanging on the wall in there. - You stole a picture off the wall? - Look at it. That's your dad's old team, isn't it? Does anybody look familiar? Yeah. What're you doing here? What's-what... what's that for? Gophers and other pests. Now, piss off. I don't take visitors. We want to ask you about the Hex. Why me? Because we know you did it, too. All right, then. Come on. Sit. I'm more of a beer guy. Suit yourself. You survived the Hex. How? You knew that we were gonna do it. Why didn't you warn us, or-or try to stop us? Both good questions. I ever tell you about my first jump? You've never said more than two words to any of us. I was as good as dead... the first time I jumped out of an airplane. All I had to do to live again was pull. That's intoxicating. I went right back up again... and it just wasn't the same. Get to your point. To even come close to that feeling again, I had to push my limits further and further. Didn't help that I wasn't born with any natural talent for anything. Nah. My luck was going to run out eventually. I needed help. Help? From who? I prayed to God, the Devil. Out loud, hell, even in my dreams. In the end, I think it was my soul that conjured the demon. You, just like that, you conjured a demon? Not "just like that"! Lanithro, the demon of the air, showed me how we could use the Hex to take what we wanted. You want to know how I survived the Hex? I created it. You... made the Hex? Just imagine what it feels like to know that you've got lives to spare. I could... take any chance I wanted, try anything... consequences be damned. I was given freedom... freedom from death itself. Because the lives of anyone who tries the Hex... then belong to you. They're the sacrifice. More. I took more than their lives. I-I took their abilities. Lanithro took their souls. It's a game he created and never grew tired of. You lying son-of-a-bitch! Wade! What the fuck did you really do? Wade! Enough! Get off of him! It was only ever supposed to be one jump. And then, the rumors got started. Human nature was impossible to control. People just had to see for themselves. I couldn't warn them, and I couldn't warn you. It became known as the Hex. If that were true, then you would be immortal by now. What are you still doing in this busted-ass trailer? That's not how it works. I mean, do I look like someone who's gonna live forever? All those lives are just second chances. And I wasted all of them. All I had left was my own. Once that happened, I quit skydiving altogether. So, there's no way to stop it? How many deaths are you responsible for? Are you responsible for my father? Sarah, get out of the way. Wade, what are you doing? Do you believe him? I don't know what's happening, but I know one thing. I take him out, and I end it. You don't know that! What do you think, Kris? Think this'll end it? Please, Wade. Don't. No, no, no. No, let him. I want this. I want this to end. Wait. You never answered my question. Your father was a good man, Sarah. He didn't deserve what happened to him. - I'm sorry. - No. You motherfucker. Sarah... Sarah. Open the door. What? Open the door! Sarah, where were you? I don't know. Uh... I was on the plane. Before you did the Hex? Yeah, I think so. We were supposed to crash, weren't we? The plane wasn't supposed to crash. The plane is crashing. Right now. What? This is how it happens. This is how the Hex works. You are not where you think you are or even when you think you are. You're occupying the space and time between when you know you're going to die and when you die. And that space and time can stretch out further than you can imagine. That's impossible. You will continue to slip between this waking nightmare and reality until you're dead. You're running out of time, but there is a way if you'll let me help you. That's impossible. Do you have the altimeter? Payson's altimeter, do you have it? Let's go! Fuck, his seat belt! There's no time! Let's go! Evan, you're next! Andy! Thank God you're still here. Yeah, I'm here. I'm just puttin' away the plane. Holy Jesus, what happened? Is that blood? Whoa! Whoa! What's the matter with you? Let's go, let's go! Lost the right engine! We're losing altitude fast! We're super low! Pull right away, guys! Hey. Hey, you're all right. Just kinda faded on me there for a second. You were right about the Hex. - We never should have tried it. - What? Is that what this is all about? Andy, please. I have to go now. I have to jump. It's the only way. I hope you know what you're doin'. Would you all kindly get the fuck out of my plane? Lisa, now you! Fuck! Sarah, run. Oh, my God. No! Come on! Come on. You made it. You have no idea. You have no fucking idea! What the fuck is happening? You still don't know? So what's the Hex? We've all heard the stories. A cursed skydive? Are you kidding me? That seems like a bad idea, but what do I know? But I don't believe in any stupid Hex curse. Come on. You are not where you think you are. You will continue to slip between this waking nightmare... ...and reality... ...until you're dead. What'd you tell her? I told her if she wanted to survive, she had to jump with your altimeter. Gullible. Just like her dad. And this thing's not a toy. How else are you gonna know how many lives you're workin' with? That look on her face was priceless, though. You are one sadistic bastard, do you know that? You're definitely goin' to hell. And maybe I can show you around. Not anytime soon, Lanithro.
