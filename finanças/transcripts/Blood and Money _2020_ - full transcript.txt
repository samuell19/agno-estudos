I hope I'm not calling too late? Hey, Jim. No problem. I recall you saying that your boy had a doe tag. Yeah, he hasn't got anything yet. Well, uh, listen. I don't have a doe permit, but I shot one today. I thought maybe you could send Benji down. He could tag it and then take him off my hands. Sounds real good. We'd definitely use the meat. Remember that place we fished in the spring? That, uh, little turnout that overlooked the St. John's River. I remember. We can be there by 8:00. All right. All right. Uh, well, good.

Sorry to keep you waiting there, Jim. You could have just dropped the note in the box. Eh. Jim, do you remember what day you came in? Um... Three or four days ago, I think, uh, what... What would that be, the 10th or 11th, maybe? Okay, here we go. Yeah. Paulie signed you in on the 10th. Yeah, right. Yeah. How's that rig holding up for you? Jesus, Bill. She's got over 100,000 miles on her already. That's good. Whatever happened with that cabin you were looking at out past the Blacks' property? Just didn't work out. Anyway, that's my home now. Out there I'm a pig. Nobody's going to pin you down. That's for sure. You're damn straight. So what are you going to do, head back to Portland? Uh, no. I'm going to spend the night in town. Then I'll come back out here for about a week. I still want to bag my buck this season. Sounds like a plan. Take care, Jim. Oh, Billy, uh, did, uh, you guys happen to open up that washed out area of the Pinkham Road yet? Yeah. Yeah, they did a few weeks ago. There's nobody at that checkpoint, though. They just started to... I don't know, to renovate the shack or something. So just be careful if you go in that way. There's no way to track you. Will do. Thanks for the info. - Have a good one. - Take care, Jim. Y'all done there, Mr. Reed? Can I get you some more coffee? Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you. Did you read about the robbery at the casino yesterday? Those people that got shot? - Yeah. - It's so sad. I did. It seems to be the way the world is now, doesn't it? - You could say that again. - Mmm. So how long are you up here this time? I think another week. I just want to get out there and bag my buck. A friend of my husband's got one the other day. - Ah. - They're around. Sure is cold enough. Yeah, let's hope it stays that way. Well, I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. Yeah.

A government spokesman has stated that there is not much truth in the rumor that the Pentagon wastefully dumped military equipment and supplies costing millions, perhaps billions, of taxpayer dollars in the year since the Vietnam War started. Hi. Hi, Debbie. Listen, I... I'm sorry that you had to see that yesterday. It was very unprofessional. No, no. It's okay, really. It's all right. Are you all right? Yeah. It's... It's just my daughter's been sick lately. Some husband and wife stuff, too, I guess. It's just so strange. Nothing is as I imagined it would be. It never is. For anyone. Yeah. No, maybe you're right. Sometimes I say this is the day that I'm just gonna get out of here, and actually see myself doing it. Play the whole thing out in my head. And then, the day ends, and... I'm still here. I'm sorry. I can't believe I just said that. It's okay. I get it. More than you'll ever know. You remind me of my daughter. She was just like you. Really? Yeah. Debbie. I should go grab that. Okay. It's so hard to describe. I mean, it's like... It's like my insides are just being eaten away. And well, drinking, that's the only way I can fix it. Part of it comes from my time overseas, what I saw... Things I did when I was serving. And I take it all out on my wife and kids. I love them so much. And every day, I just want to leave and not torture them anymore. I turn to God. I go to church. And I pray. And I ask God to forgive me. But He's nowhere to be found. I can't find Him. You said you served? Yes, sir. Two tours in the sand with the army. Infantry, third ID. Nam, me, Marines. The two-one. Uh... Jim Reed. George Tevo. Those were some powerful words you said up there earlier. Been there. Same exact place. It's fucking rough, man. My little girl has been in and out of the hospital. I don't know how to help her. Those fucking doctors, they just talk at you, you know? I got to get my shit together. They ain't going to make it without me. You married? I was. Kids? Yeah. Any chance you could fix it? No, my daughter's gone, and, uh... My son and I haven't talked with each other in a year. I'm not quite there yet. Any advice? If I had any good advice, I probably wouldn't be here. Yeah, right. Ha! Just take it one day at a time, George. That's all any of us can do. Yeah. There's my ride. I gotta get going. - Okay. - Yeah. See ya. Hey, Mr. Reed. Hi, Debbie. Hey, Jeff, do you want to take Ali, you guys go eat in the car? I'll be right there. Late night? I saw your truck outside Wheeler's last night. I hope I'm not out of line here. I just... I remember you saying you're sober. Yeah, it's been a long time. I didn't slip. Yeah, I know. I could tell. Close, though, right? I've had some experience with it. You know, there's some really good meetings around town. Yeah, yeah. I know. Yeah. All right. Well, I should... I should get going. Probably murdering each other in the back of the car. - Have a good one. - You, too. Debbie? Thank you. I mean, is that... Is that a sound theory right now? I think it's a very sound theory. I would be very surprised if we go back... Charles, another point is that number that he had on the S&P, that 2,800, 2,820 number, and your 2,600 number on the Dow, uh, those, those... God damn it! Oh, my God. Oh, Jesus. Oh, no. No, no. Oh, my God. What on earth... What the fuck are you doing out here? Jesus! Don't talk. Stop! You're a fucking dead man. What? What the fuck does that mean?

Uh... Ah, I, uh... I'm sorry, I didn't see you. I thought maybe you were sleeping. - Huh. - I put my details in the box. I forgot a couple of things. I got to go back into town. No fucking bother at all. How about a cup of coffee? Coffee? Oh, no. Uh, no, thank you. I really am in a bit of a hurry. This late at night? Get the fuck out of here. Come on. I insist. Yeah, Okay. What the fuck? Why not? Huh? You want a splash? Oh, no, I'm... I'm good. Ah, ah? Suit yourself. Ah. You know, I love the night shift out here. No bullshit. Used to have a dog that would come out here with me. Mmm. Then my wife wants to keep him at home with her. [LAUGHS} It's fine. She's the boss, I guess. Yeah. Guess that leaves me shit out of luck. You know what I'm saying? Mmm. I can turn up the heat if you're cold. No, no, no, no, no. I'm... I'm good. Thanks. What? Is that blood on your jacket? Looks pretty fresh. Didn't get to see what you had on your truck when you pulled in. You, uh, shoot something out there? No. I didn't shoot anything. You sure about that? Because you got to report anything you shoot out there. No. No, I know that. It's just... I'm... I'm sick. Okay? I'm sick. I cough up blood every once in a while. I had a wicked episode today. It was fucking brutal. You got the cancer or something? I... You know, you just reminded me. I need to... I need to go out and take my pills. Thanks for the coffee. $60 on pump four. Is that it? A pack of Bilsons. All right, $67.75. Shit. I'm out of quarters. - Give me a sec. - Uh... Sir. Sir. Is that your RV outside? The custom job... I've never seen anything like that. Yeah.

Two shots of whiskey. You're going to actually drink them this time? Just pour the fucking shots, Okay? Again. Do you believe that shit? Recapping our top story, a massive manhunt continues tonight as authorities search for five suspects in a violent armed robbery at the Franklin Casino two days ago. The robbery led to a shootout between casino security and the suspects, leaving three security guards dead and 12 civilians injured. Earlier today, authorities released surveillance camera images of two of the five suspects, hoping for the public's help in identifying them. According to the casino, the crew made off with close to $1.2 million. Police believe the suspects may be headed north for the border. The five are considered armed and extremely dangerous. If you spot them, call the state police immediately. In other news, a water main break near During Avenue caused major flooding earlier today. Oh, fuck! Ah! Ah! Oh. Oh, shit. Jesus Christ. George?

You better not be fucking with me. If you are, I'll kill your son and his whole damn family. You know that, right? I'd kill your daughter, too, but... looks like you took care of that one. Yeah, I went through all your shit. Oh, she's beautiful. Too fucking bad about that one. Must suck living with the fact that your kid died because of you. Lot of fucking guilt there.
