So, we come to this... Austrian dragons on the streets of Vienna... with drawn swords against his own people. Count Tafe has ordered the police to be strict. Fair but strict. My people must learn. You have no right to arrest me. I'm Slovenian. I'm Czech. Here there are no Czechs, Slovenes, Croatians or Hungarians, are loyal subjects of the Austrian Emperor. Take him to trial. Pr�ximo... Documents... Name... - Maurice, Iphraim, journalist. - What a surprise! Newspaper editors in a police station. It's nothing surprising, sir, in a police state. This is not my first visit here. On this occasion, how do you explain your presence... on student marches? I was just passing by. Inspector, I didn't see any disorder, until the police and soldiers arrive. If it were the other way around, these demonstrations would not happen so much. You're insinuating... To a Jew that my quotation in the New Testament would be unchristian. Make yourself available to the police for future interrogations. Naturally. I have nothing to hide. You are lucky. I wish I could say the same. - Next! Documents. - I don't have them. And your name, then? Rudolf. - Rudolf what? - Make your choice! Rudolf, Franz, Charles. No documents. You would be successful as a comedian... Your Royal Highness! I wanted... Please forgive me! I naturally forgive you, and you in return forgive these... these friends of mine. - and releases them immediately. - Immediately, Your Royal Highness. Thanks. It's cold... cold... I am cold... Thanks. Your Royal Highness may enter immediately. Disapproved. After all these years the military would use another shovel to polish the buttons. We ruled perfectly for three centuries, with chalk and alcohol. This new mixture is more effective in official use. I would never accept change just for the sake of changing. Disapproved. Therefore... - I don't remember telling him he could sit down. - No, sir. When you were a child, and you were insolent, I had you punished. Remember the punishments I can still inflict? Certainly. He made me dig in the snow once, I was six years old, sir. Remember? In one thing at least, it stands firm. You always let me down. You don't ride as well as your mother, you don't shoot as well as I do. I wanted you to agree to serve in the Imperial Guard, and you chose the infantry regiment among strangers. I found a Spanish princess for you to marry, and you preferred to choose a Belgian. Publicly opposes my political opinions, associates with liberals, anarchists, Jews. And now this... Your spy is very fast. Quick enough to inform me of the companies you keep. - Maurice was just passing by. - Passing... In time to see how your hussars... they advanced on young people who rebelled against... Order! They protested... the order! Guided by their friends in the socialist press. We don't see it so seldom that we should take advantage of this opportunity. - Your private life... - It's mine! It belongs to the people! Next week there will be a public celebration of the fifth year of your marriage. I would prefer that until then your marital life was something more conventional. Conventional like your lord, the Empress... traveling from one end of the world to another, and never staying in town more than two weeks at a time? It became that. What took you away from here, father? Your mother and I, in our own way, love each other. I pray that one day you will find such happiness with Stefanie. Is it our happiness that worries him, or the homeland that the Habsburgs left him? Anyway, if something happened to me, he always has Archduke Ferdinand. My idea is that he is not destined for Emperor! - I don't think you think your son is! - Rudolf! Sir? What wall is between us? The ties... that there were... you broke them, father. How are the maneuvers? Will you get the third army body? Well, I'm the second in command, General Von Lederburg... is having problems for not having enough horses. People don't seem to live to an old age in Vienna. Look at my father is very close to sixty... exercise daily, has a simple diet of stews, and drinks moderately. Perhaps I will be his age when I become Empress, my dear. Is your dress for the big occasion pretty? - What jewelry will you wear? - This matters? Your mother will be late, and in black, It's a little gem, and all eyes will be on it the moment it arrives. You don't even know if she'll come. The last night... - I heard you were on the fox hunt in England. - But she'll be here! She comes back whenever she has the chance to play the perfect mother! Stefanie, be careful how you talk about the Empress! He heard? You are always on her side, against me. In the name of Heaven, I am your son! - And that's something you should remember! I've seen the way he looks at her sometimes and not the way a son... ...you should look at my mother... I always thought I was a smug, idiotic bourgeois, but i never thought it was this bad and so low. Tell me these things one more time, just once... and I'll break your sick and stupid Belgian neck! Did you recognize Count Hoyos? Do you know the girl? It's a new one for me. - A gypsy. It's called Marinka. - What does she do? She dances, and... well, she dances. It's hot in here! I need an air change. You mean, you need a change. - Will you be here tomorrow night? - If someone invites me. Someone just invited. Marinka! I'll be there in a moment! I told Hoyos to give his gypsy a bath. - However, in case you're upset... - Mizzi Kaspar, you're a... His Royal Highness has the most loyal and obedient subject. If you are so loyal and obedient, first you take off your clothes. First everything is removed. Second, you come quickly to bed. Secondly... Second is also done. - And as a third? - Third... From what I can see, I gather that His Highness is upset. No, His Highness is very, very upset. I know many men who would like to be annoyed by the beautiful Mizzi Kaspar. - They cannot afford it in this system. - What system? A system where we have archdukes, princesses and women desperately available. Last night, in the court of Baloo, a brunette Polish woman, wanted to talk to me. I asked to meet with her. I later found out that I had slept with her. - Did you have to remind him? - It took all my skin off in diplomacy. Even my father would be proud of me. The dear old man! - But the Emperor is not that old. - The emperor was born old. Old men should not be allowed to rule. At our meeting tonight at the Prater with the Hungarians, if you're still bored, we can go abroad again. We try travel, we try politics, cheating, drinking... I don't like the old man, what do we have left? - Always stay ... in the dark. - Inoc�ncia is pr�xima from ignor�ncia. I believe His Royal Highness should resign in my favor. - Was it followed? - We got rid of them. Where are Prince Johan and his men from Hungary? It's probably harder to get rid of the police than you are. I haven't been to the Prater for a long time. Read carefully as I take a walk, It's my article on student unrest. I hope it doesn't get censored like the previous one. Don't miss out on a good read. I think there are some good things. Bareheaded, wearing a uniform... What do you think he wants, or not here? Also, Taafe's spies doubt he's on Zakers. - I need to see your father. - King? What does my brave knight want? To ask for your hand, my princess. Does my lady mind having a drink with me? Please go away. I don't know him. Well, I thought since I was alone... - You are not alone. - Sorry, I didn't know you were with her. Sorry, I beg your pardon... I beg your pardon. Your attitude was just like his, lying, blatantly. - Lying? - Which was with me. How do I know him? I can't see well without my glasses, I dare not use them in public. I could look the other way, and you can see for yourself, they are totally unknown. It's just as bad that I'm talking to you and not him. - It's that bad... - Then I shouldn't. Thank you anyway. - What a horrible face! Who are you? - I am the devil! I came for you! - Oh, why, why? - Because, I came to get it, I'm going to cook it in the soup. Pity, pity! Please, lord devil. Pity, pity! pity? Never! "Thank you", she says! Ha-ha! How sad it was. They were in love and she was punished. Oh look! PAUSE FIVE MINUTES - Are you sure I don't know him? - I said we never met. Oh! Look! Aren't we adorable? Bring this one, bring this one win a prize! Now, it's my turn. Ten Heller! I don't think we need them. I ask him why he lacks faith in me so much. Be alert! Failed! What did I say? Failed! This is becoming monotonous. Failed! - I failed... - Period! Oh, period! Hey everybody, look, the officer to my left got a bottle of wine, for just... Hey sir... I wanted to draw attention to us. I'm thirsty! I would like a bottle of wine. You know the saying, "What is the sheep to the ram." Perhaps now you believe that I was thirsty. Now I believe in everything. My mother always tells me I have the manners of a coachman. - Well, have you? - I have strange ways, but I need them. I should have had them anyway, I had seven teachers as a child. - Seven? Must have been a terrible child. - Well, you know how it is... Did your parents understand you? - Did you say something so funny? - No... but a sad thing. Now I understand why I have parents. So that their children could be misunderstood. - My children will not be. - I assume you don't have any? - Not even committed? - I'm more what you can call, lonely. This I can understand. Has anyone ever been successful in the chase? One thinks so, but I am indifferent. And the others are so busy with their uniforms and horses... Would you like to dance with me? to ask the same. I know young ladies shouldn't, but coachmen can. Heavens, you must be the best in the world! Oh, I have to disappear! Thank you and I'm sorry. Excuse me! No, she would never come to a place like this! Johane! He almost didn't recognize him without his beard. I hoped not. But with six carriage changes between Budapest and Vienna... By the way, dear Rudi, this is Count Karoli. - I'm glad to finally meet you. - Goodnight. I look forward to hearing your news. First of all, Karoli was elected to lead the Hungarian uprising. Yea? Let me explain. For us to be able to overthrow the current regime in Hungary, we have to have with us not students, intellectuals or... disgruntled officers, we must also have... the support of the common people, among the farmers, the middle classes. If I go back with Prince Johan, your cousin, we will carry a great weight, but if I can say that you are supporting us, then we will seek the support we need from all classes. You can tell this to your friends in Budapest: I support the demand for an independent Hungary, I believe in free elections... since Hungary remained unimpeded. - I was expecting something more profound. - I repeat. Since to Hungary to remain non-Imperial. And remember this, my friends, I intend to save the Empire, but not to divide it. God be praised for granting Your Highness... one more day to live. Your schedule for today, Your Highness. at eleven o'clock visit your mother,... Empress Elisabeth, at Sch�nbrunn Palace. At two o'clock at the train station to meet the Prince of Wales. Keep company at dinner. Tomorrow, at eleven, a game of tennis. The Order of the Garter was prepared for... - show Queen Victoria that I wore it? - Your Highness! - You know my orders! - Orders? Whose orders? From the Count of Taafe? Now you've become one of your spies? Everyone in this Palace already conspires against me, trying to... - Your Highness! - This is my migraine, Loschek... Do you know how it hurts? It's not the pain, it's the fear of pain. Your mother, the Empress, did not command me, she asked me to help him quit. It is dangerous, Your Highness. I will see you today. In her honor, therefore... Rudolf! God save Rudolf! - Your Highness, good morning. - My mother, where is she? Her Majesty the Empress is in the greenhouse. He asked for today, not to follow the protocol... - I don't understand... - Don't put on that angry air. We won't. In England, where they create the most beautiful cam�lias. - Do you know how they usually take care of them? - No, Your Majesty. Tea leaves. They just put the parts together around the roots... We will try the same, Your Majesty. Ch�,... Well, I just have to find someone in Vienna who drinks tea instead of coffee. Maybe we should try the British Embassy. Voc� seems happy to see me. I'm happy to see you. You should have let me know of your early presence, instead of giving the impression of wanting to hide. I even have the delicious sensation of having your voice running through my senses. Oh Mom, you can't believe what a wonderful surprise it is. the joy of thinking that you came to my wedding anniversary party, is confused with the memory of these terrible five years. - It's so hot in here. Can we go outside? - Of course you can. At�amanh�ent�o, Otto, Fritz... And you look tired. This is due to the many late nights at Zahar. I know what you do, even in England. And the migraine... Is it better? If you want to know if I'm still taking morphine, "Yea". But, not so often. And in your honor, not today. And today I found out. Even my mother had people spying on me. But you also have Los�ek We both love you. I suppose my father thinks as you do that he likes me too. N�o imagine, n�o. But he shows his affection for me in the strangest possible way. It is no stranger than your affection for him. However, I'm so glad to see you. His love is expressed in phrases with a certain amount of charm. Why does it keep disappearing forever? One day it's here, the next it's gone. - Never dare to say goodbye. - I hate the word. It's so terribly final. I never use the word "Goodbye,". And my granddaughter? Oh God, I hate that word too! It's lovely! Fortunately, it didn't come out to any of the parents. Perhaps not in temperament, and there will be a generation free of insanity. In this family this should not be regarded as a grace! In this family, no. Never! My dear Edward, how nice to see you again. - Nice to see you. - This way... Yours or mine? Excuse me? The National Anthem. I'm deaf, so I can't tell one from the other. - � a "Marcha Radetski". Strauss pai. - Ui! We are ready, Your Highness. The Guard of Honor, ready for your inspection. Very presentable men. - How is dear Queen Victoria? - Amazingly healthy. And your mother? You see her more in England than I do here. Great honor, congratulations. - Buffalo Bill is still in London? - Very fun. You left. Now he's gone to Germany. I believe the Kaiser will soon invite you to the next Prussian Government. William, I think we should try a little harder to sympathize with him. I can't stand it, even though we're family and he's my cousin. Thank God you're not my cousin. Almost everyone else is. Oh! British decoration. Very good. No, I'm not your cousin, but you could be your father. My dad? It is impossible to meet Elizabeth and not fall in love with her. She remains the most beautiful woman in Europe. I wish I could move my feet like she rides a horse. I can never keep up. Brought some foxes to refine your flock's blood. Long live Edward! Long live the Prince of Wales! By the way, why are there always red carpets? The stations are ideal places for assassinations. On the red carpet you don't see the blood. Angry! Very good! - Tell me, where is she from? - Marinka is a Hungarian Gypsy. You know, we have all races and colors in the British Empire... but looking on a map, but I don't find a single inhabitant of Hungary, but only Hungarians can dance like she does. When you become king, you can change all that. Attach Hungary. When? Forget that my mother is 55 years old. And only 55. The Emperor is sixty. Only sixty. My God, here we sit, successors to the throne awaiting a death... ...to discover the meaning of life. But you know, Rudolf... Thank you dear Mizzi. You know, you have to come to terms with life. You have to find compensations such as... or you end up crazy, with so many frustrations... to proclaim himself lustful, and libertine, above all... ...or a terrible player, if what they say is true, but I have at least shared some emotions from the experiences with my people, and I shall have lived, before I became king. Why would anyone want our work? Sometimes I ask myself... Why? My father tells him why. Man is born to be king. - Destiny, the divine right, he has us all. - Don't be technical, my young prince. Your father does very well, he has all the attributes of royalty, all the diplomatic expertise. All the stubbornness. All resistance to new ideas, which man can accumulate. Students in Vienna are full of life, and their enthusiasm and ideas spring up... But for him they are dissidents and criminals, they have to be traitors. Oh, Marina! Beautiful creature! It's not English, unfortunately, but it's beautiful all the same! She doesn't usually wear that dress, but it's in honor of the Prince of Wales... Do me a great honor. - Does she speak English? - You're a gypsy. My father taught my mother something, but I never learned the language. I have the feeling it's done deliberately. I think what I mean, and she understands, Edward. - Edward, I have to leave. State Affairs. - Do you have to go? - For an hour or two? - The blue door leads to a private staircase. Come sit down, my dear! Drink some champagne! What's the news? Prince Johan and Count Karoli managed to avoid the secret police. - They arrived safely in Budapest. - What about? They want you to commit more deeply. - Continues. - He wants you to be his king. Beware Szeps, there is a word that is betrayal! On the contrary, he wants to avoid bloodshed... ...the horrors of civil war. It's dangerous, my friend. Dangerous because of my father. He would rather see the Empire destroyed, but never separate it without having ordered it. - Well, tell them... to be patient. - Patients? So what about the people? The poor who do not have the right to vote, with journalists whose articles are censored, with young students who think they have a vision of how the world should be, think of political prisoners, Jews... Do you have to be patient, too? And for how long? I said, tell them to be patient. Because if I have to learn to be patient, then so must they. - They just went up. - It's fine. Well done Your Highness. I thought he would never come out. Not now. I think it must have been extremely busy. At least half an hour while the police wait outside. In less than half an hour my reputation will be destroyed. Have you ever felt like you were... being manipulated? you? I? What question! Bravo, Edward. Very well played. How do I know I'm really good if you don't compete against me? - What nonsense! - Thank you for the game, sir. So it was a small revenge for his horse's victory in the Derby... ...last year. - I hope we come back again. Against my horse? It would be monstrous imprudence! By the way, haven't I seen your sister and her little misses? Now we're not so little, now we're ladies. Typical, in case you haven't noticed. nonsense. I'm just going to freshen up, I'd like to see them again. It's fine, sir. Your Highness, this will help you. Thank you darling. Thank you very much. It's a pleasure. - Edward, who is your friend? - He lives in Vienna. - His sister is Helena Vetsera. - I never heard of him. Did you hear? We met the Viva Baroness Vetsera. It does not belong to the old nobility and was never received in the Court. But he is a member of the Jockey Club. I signed up myself. One thing you have, Edward, when you're a friend, is real. - Come and meet them. - After the game. - And on the other side? - The Archduke. Vienna is full of Archdukes. Think of the great prince. I don't see his wife here. If I hung out with him more, maybe we'd hear less stories. And, there you are! My Baroness face... And you, my girl! You are a wonderful woman! How you grew up! Hannah! And George... How nice to see you again. Your Highness, may I introduce you to Duke Michael of Bragan�a? I know your uncle very well. I visited him in Portugal. I never went back there unfortunately. Maria, come with me a moment. I thought of a little conspiracy and I want you to participate. Yea? I learned that my old friend Baltaci's family was never received at Court. - We are not of the old nobility. - Nonsense! I think it's a personal offense. As soon as I finish playing the game, I present it to the Prince. Your Highness, thank you, but I've had the pleasure, better said, to meet Archduke Rudolf. I have no intention of seeing him again... - other than to send you a simple message. - What message? Tell your Imperial Highness that cheating is not nice. This just proves that I was taught at school: One should not believe in princes! Who do you smile so tenderly, Helena? � Balatsi. Why do they call it "rattlesnake"? They say it's so poisonous, you never know when it's going to strike. Theresa Stokau mustn't smile so much. Your teeth are as false as your pearls. And what does she think she's wearing? Wallpaper? It seems to me as useless as an old carriage. That daughter, at least, is very pretty, but stupid, almost as stupid as her father. Who wants to be an ambassador from what I've heard. Even if I can fall asleep, my dear Countess, I hope you'll wait, that your... guest wake up. Must have some interest in that girl. - Very well, my dear. - What? Well, the way you woke me up. Did you see that? A ballerina. What was it for? - Katarina Srat, sabe. - Ah, naturally. Is it true what they say about her and the Emperor? - Of course, it's your mistress. - Lizel! - Everyone knows it! - What's a mistress to do? How can I explain to you? Remember Pompadour? Suppose the Emperor was Louis XV, and suppose Katarina Srat was the Pompadour. - Oh! - Oh, hello, my dear... And you, beautiful young creatures. Theresa isn't here? no. She went to another cabin to see a friend. Well, you think you'll be delighted when you hear my idea. Come on, Lizel... I thought I'd introduce you to the Empress' box. I? - To me? Me, the Emperor? - Come quickly, before the end of the break. A little color doesn't hurt. And remember, always show your best face. Tell me... when can you tell the Emperor of the Pope that you want to be ambassador in Constantinople? Well, not right away. Maybe it's best to introduce her to the prince first. - And when can I ask, then? - Well, there are times for that. A woman would be stupid if she should... Maybe it's better not to say anything. Some women are more attractive when they don't talk. Here we are at... Let me see you... - Yes, but on the Balkans, Junot faced... - Your Highness. Excuse me, Your Excellency. My dear cousin... Thank you for saving me from the Balkan situation. - The young Baroness Stokau. -Her highness... Daughter of Baroness Stokau. Champagne? "Gis�le" was never my favorite ballet. It is overly sentimental. You can go, my dear. Your cabin is not far. It's on the other side. I do not need the consent of a prosecutor. Not yet. Not yet... Please don't move. I can't reach the chair. Just a moment... There is Your Majesty. No need to reduce half a centimeter. No, as long as he doesn't run. Now Riki, look at his attitude when he trots. � of course. Good morning, mother. But what a pleasant surprise! - How was it? - Incredible, Your Majesty. - The skirt seemed to frighten him. - Amazing too, Your Majesty. Now see how important this is, to experience this on a horse. Admit that you are even more beautiful when you ride. The only money I honestly earned, when I was a child your grandfather and I used to perform at a circus, for some poor villagers, people without money. Oh, how beautiful those days were! We were so happy... And you, did you have a good childhood? - Whenever you were present. - I was sick. I thought I was sick. I had to go outside. But he always managed to be present on all the important days of my life. On my first communion, on my twenty-first birthday, on my…wedding. When I remember that horrible sacrifice, I should have avoided it! But he forgot, he was present on another important day. When? On the day you were born. - Maria? - Yea? Notice that it's playing the same melody as the other day? Here he looked her in the eyes and took her in his arms. Yes, but you must be exhausted. He played it probably 150 times. Countess Larissa came to visit Her Excellency. I must announce... Oh, I'm so glad to at least find someone home. - What a pleasant surprise! - I was just passing by and I thought... Oh no, Maria, please don't stop. Plays so wonderfully... But what a charming look, and what a lovely dress. Won't you sit down? No thanks. I think it's better to walk, it calms the nerves and avoids gaining weight. I can? Speaking of weight, have you seen young Diana Meternik lately? She puts crimson on every cheek she finds. On the run, last night. for everyone's safety, she should sit in the audience. I don't think the cabins support your weight. But nobody noticed her. Because everyone was just looking at their daughter. Mary was sensational. All the questions were about her. Come on, keep playing and listen to me. My cousin Rudolf wants to see you. An unexpected lucky gift has arrived! Keep going, I follow... Talked like about you for an hour. No, no, no! It sounds like this! Play louder. He wants to see you. You want me to accompany you. Do you want to go? And leave it all to me. Ah... I'd like to keep playing, but I have to go. I have to try on a new dress for Prince Philip's party. It will be very boring, but what can you do? Helen, au revoir. I really have to fly. Hanna... e Maria... Oh! He knows? I just had a splendid idea. Why don't you come with me and help me? It also has a refined taste. Isn't it too late for shopping? Helena, do me a favor, lend me Maria for a few hours. - I hate it when I'm alone. - Well, certainly, if you think that Maria... Come quickly, Maria, go get dressed. - Mom, are you sure you don't mind? - Of course dear. But come back soon. - Please, can I go too? - No, you're too young. I need some time. If it's not too late. Don't worry about Maria. It's in good hands. Oh, heavens I have so much to do. Always so busy these days! No need to be nervous. Let me see you! You have no foot in your face. At least it's not enough. Ready! Do what you want with your eyes. They are wonderful. But don't get too bored. It doesn't feel good, is it? - I don't think she's scared at all. - You have a beautiful smile. Use it often. Rudolf doesn't like serious people. There are many serious faces around you. - Bratfish with its carriage. - With Countess Larissa. That was a few years ago! Welcome. Have fun my dear. And enjoy this glorious day well. Do you see the future you can have? And who will know? You might even have a nice time. Over here, please. Follow me please. "But I don't believe in princes!" Edward of Wales gave me your message. I was thinking you weren't coming, ...or maybe at the last minute, I was afraid. - Afraid of what? I don't know! From this dark place, or... from me. He knows? I think if I was there, I wouldn't be afraid of anything. So here is where you live. And this is yours. Now I'm thinking of you, every day sitting in this big chair, A huge chair, I can honestly tell you. You're writing at your office desk... - It is the Louis IX wedding ring of France. - Not gold, not even silver. As in most marriages, it is simple metal, iron. His fingers were almost as thin as mine. The wedding ring, a saint, imagine! I don't like that. Do you always sit with that in front of you? It was a gift from my cousin Ludwig. So that he would buy me, for being alive. Life is so... Ludwig, do you mean the King, Duke of Bavaria? - What... - Lies! These stories are all lies! He was just... just... different. It wasn't crazy! Nobody knows for sure how he died. - Don't you want to... take off your hat, and your coat? - There are no mirrors. In the next room. Is that the prince's bed? It's very good. Anyway, I don't sleep much. Countess Larissa is right in my nose. I look horrible. - Is there something wrong? - No. - It's just different from what I thought it would be. - Different? How? No, that's not true either. I knew what you were like, but I expected it to be different. - That everything was simpler, that's all. - I don't understand. Many come here with Countess Larissa, who powders their noses at the entrance to the gates. The beginning is always the same, the end is always the same and what happens in the middle is... - Well, not for you, that's what I realized. - I'm glad you understood. - Thank you, Your Highness. - Thank you, Rudolf. Thank you Rudolph. And when will I see you again? tomorrow. I will find a way. What a waste! Caviar, champagne... Make sure they don't go to waste as soon as I turn my back. You were safe when you said you didn't trust the princes. Sim. You can call Bratfish. The Baroness is on her way out. Goodnight My Love. What a lovely thing to say. Goodnight My Love. Well Hoyos, go ahead. - Will it always be like this? - Not always. I am satisfied. It's nice at the moment, but after a while... Oh, if only I weren't a Habsburg prince! And yet they seem to be the people who want the Empire to collapse. Destroy the Habsburgs. No, Your Highness almost all of them carry the colors of Austria. For them the monarchy is an institution. Do you mean that Francisco José became one of them? These rebellious Hungarians that Karoli spoke of... I hope it doesn't mean violence. No Revolution is usually made without some bloodshed. Long live the Royal Prince! Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! There are disturbances ahead, sir. He was worried. Thank you Rudolf, I appreciate your concern, especially in such an unexpected situation. I don't see why not. Today I'm on duty. I'm sure any Habsburg would do the same. No, today you have behaved as I expected my son to behave. Oh, thank you, my dear, for this wonderful piece by Faberg�. You should thank Rudolf, Your Majesty. You would never allow me to choose anything. And please also thank Erci for her delicious letter. Obviously, I'll have to spend a lot until my next birthday, trying to reward you, but I'm grateful. Rudolf, don't go yet. I want you to know how deeply I am grateful for your protective gesture this afternoon. As your father, I would like to try to get to know you better. Your friend, the Prince of Wales, have you benefited from your visit? - Benefit? - For any advice you might have given. Sir, Count Taafe is waiting for me at the Zahar for my private party. Edward, your friend spoke to me because he is sincerely worried about you. My private life and Edward don't give me the right to lectures. I don't mean your private life. And relieve yourself because I have nothing against your actress friend. And ease your mind, sir... knowing that I have nothing against your friend the actress. It's about your public life, which I want to discuss. My public life consists of receptions, balls, charity galas, duties... obligations that any scarecrow could participate! I should be learning the subjects of governance, I hate to be present when you consult with your ministers. When you learn to moderate your attitudes, you are welcome to join us. Are you not surprised at what you sincerely believe? Let me say it as a parent, not as a consulting company. Don't trust people. Among the people there are certain enlightened minds but the people are a multitude, the same herd that stormed this palace when he was just 8 years old. The same mob that killed my great-aunt Marie Antoinette. This is your people. The people you want to allow to govern themselves. Look at these countries, the enlightened countries, like America and France, Can you imagine their unhappiness? The Republican States continue to be involved in wars, are poor, remain poor, the rich get richer, cops and judges are the cheapest money can buy. Are you listening to me? - I'm listening, but I don't agree. - To maintain supreme power, - must recognize the responsibilities of power. - Power! He clings to him like a miser. Sitting here as heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, I am no more than a political eunuch. Would you like to be Inspector General? Well, where else I could collaborate would be by being your Second Corps Commander. Count Taafe will work out his promotion to the rank of General... with the entire commission of Inspecting the Royal forces within the Empire. Well, for once, I have no words. You will have to travel frequently visiting the different units. Your first assignment will be to represent me in Prague... in the maneuvers of the Seventh Army. Dad... - You are satisfied! - Grateful. Well, I won't keep you any longer. Everyone is waiting for you to open the dance. Tell Count Taafe I want to speak with him. Your Majesty? This young woman is different from other women... so different that I think everything should be done to arrange a marriage for her with... ...the Duke Miguel de Bragan�a. - Portugal is my debtor. I helped them in their claims in Brazil. - And the family, that I don't know... - I wouldn't know, Your Majesty. They are rich. Extremely wealthy. Cosmopolitans. They take a lot of trips. You have to see if you can get something, in other words, your family... you can start your rich cosmopolitan travels again. Any piece looks impressive when it fires empty cartridges make a lot of noise! What is your maximum elevation? Sorry, I don't know, sir. What is the maximum elevation of this cannon? We will propose the manufacture of this cannon. And an important and simple fact, we have to ask a sergeant. It's one thing I check several times, I think the sergeant should be promoted and you gentlemen should take a course in artillery. These rifles should be cleaned with oil. Infantry should be taught how to use them. I've noticed that the horses are not well taken care of. I only see an advantage in providing the army with more outdated ones. If they fall into the enemy's hands, you will deceive them too. General! All maps of border areas must be reviewed, and all officers must be instructed in the reading of maps. His Imperial Highness The Royal Prince Rudolf. Your Highness, this is an honor. Intrusion, I'm afraid, dear cousin. I need your help. I'm on my way to the parade in Linz. - I have to see Maria. -She's out skating. Forgive me, leave immediately. My train leaves in a few hours. Your Highness, please, I beg you, be patient. I don't understand. With this girl you've never been in love before, I should have understood. This relationship, well I know it's a love relationship, but it can hurt you, hurt you. Destroy her every opportunity to be... happy with someone else. Who told you to tell me that? Was it Count Taafe? I thought this time I kept it very secret. So my father knows too. That's why he gave me the... And I thought I had finally given myself a responsibility. I was grateful. I was almost liking him. I remember now, because he told me that he would have to travel often. Your Highness, Taafe told me to tell you this, but you didn't tell me why. Of one thing he may be right. I mean no harm to you, my friend. - Looks like you weren't surprised? - I didn't. Sometimes, before I fall asleep, I know that the next day I will see you. My last thought is of you. - Hot chocolate. - Flavored wine for me. My brother George needs to watch him. You are with your friends. It's fine. It's terrible, but I can see better beyond, I can see you here. Vanity, vanity... - My love, you seem exhausted. - I'm thinner. Worried about you, far away in Vienna, and a lot going on behind my back. If it makes you jealous, I can tell you that many things are going through. For example? The Duke of Bragan�a made me a marriage proposal, through his uncle, the king of Portugal. Bring her! And Count Taafe... ...offered my uncle the post of Ambassador to Brazil. I was a fool to believe they would leave us alone. The Emperor has the biggest ears in Europe. And I think I have the most horrible nose. �? Thanks. - How much time? - Just a few hours. I'm just passing through. - Did you get my letters? - Every day. - I thought a little... - What? I know now that they opened them And copies are sent to Count Taafe. But why? We didn't hurt anyone! Oh yes of course! You have a wife and a son and you will have an Empire. What is Mary? What is it? Nothing. irremediable. yes. Uncle infinitely desperate. It cannot be irremediable! Look at me! I'm looking. I have to go now. This boring parade in Linz. But always remember this, it may take time, but we will be together one day... and we will never be apart again. So now they meet openly in public places! His Highness doesn't seem to care who sees them, to worry about avoiding my men. It is easier to make peace between two nations, to stop a man and a woman who are in love. If she were a daughter... mine in this kind of... was resolved by me, and my family. This is a description... for the name and reputation of the Habsburgs throughout Europe. Making the subject of gossip... for the foreign press... There are no actions I can take, sir, without your orders. And I will do what the Emperor wants me to do. It's what most parents in the same situation would do if they had the power. Or maybe... If I had your authority, sir, a higher order would not be necessary. - There are ways and means... - You have my approval. What is this? Tell me the truth and don't lie. Why did I lie? Would you rather believe someone who writes such a letter and doesn't sign it? Tell me what is written here is not true. So it's true! Have a lover! You've been having secret meetings! Now I know why you have so much shopping to do, so many little discussions. What's his name? Mom, it's not what you think. - He loves me. - What's his name? I can't tell you. But what a shame for a person not to know what others know! Answer me. Answer me! - Mom, if I told you... I shouldn't! I can't! - Very good! For this indecent person, I have some great advice. "It's good advice that you should send your daughter out of the country as soon as possible." - No! - It's what you do. - Then tell me his name! - I said. I can't. You don't leave the house. From this room until your bags are packed. M�e! M�e! I don't think you're enjoying the duties of Inspector General. It's not! I have no authority. I'm still a puppet prince! Anyway, it's not the issue. I intend to resign as soon as I get back... to Vienna, and please don't ask me why. And I'm asking why! When he promoted me to Inspector General, I was happy. Pleased. I figured you'd given me something important to do. It's important. Start to see how much. Of course I wanted, using her own words, "traveled a lot" could have sent me on a mission to China or Japan. Or further. The only problem for sure is that I wouldn't have traveled alone. Praise God for granting Your Highness one more day to live. Thank you, Loschek. - When did you arrive last night? - The train arrived late. Almost day. So I let him sleep an hour longer. Simple clothes, today. And tell Bratfisch to fetch Baroness Maria. Sorry Your Highness, but Countess Larissa is at the entrance. What, at this hour? Send her in! To your room? Why not? We already spent a night together, on a trip. - Majesty, forgive me. - There must be a reason. Don't blame me for bringing you bad news. - For God's sake! Say what! - Maria... - Her family sent her on a trip. - They know? They know there is a lover. They don't know who he is. Who told you? Count Taafe arranged to let them know. - With my father's consent? - The Count is very intelligent to act in matters... like these, without the Emperor's consent... - Where did you send her? - My arm... It hurt me! - Where? - The family was too scared to say. It all happened last night. There was nothing I could do... Believe me. - The emperor. I want to see you immediately, - Today, it will not be possible. Her Majesty said she doesn't want to see anyone, not even you mentioned your name. Neither does anyone. At least for the next 24 hours. Your Highness! Can someone please bring me a glass of water? Drink some more of this. And put that stupid revolver away. A little more wine makes me miss my aim. Francisco is dead! Rudolf, is dead! Karl, he's dead! Jos�, is dead! Reload this, Alex. You're a good guy. Carry this, for Your Highness. Your Highness, you are tired. It's better to go home. I have to wait at home for 24 hours to see my father. Have you ever waited this long to see your father? No, Your Highness. I never expected. I never knew who my father was. My father approved of you. I knew that? I approve of you too, Mizzi! For heaven's sake I approved of you! - To show you how I approve... - So it's more your way! D-me tua m�o! Where did you see an Inspector General greet you? I ask him. Gentlemen, like all good musicians, you play with your eyes closed. Well, now... then, go to sleep like a good boy. Wake me up when my father sends for me. Now go to sleep. Don't worry. Not all of them! It's to Mizzi you're talking, remember? Forgive me... My behavior was terrible, horrible... I forgive you. - Lie down next to me. - I don't want to wrinkle this dress. - Buy another one tomorrow. - There's no need to do that. All you have to do is sleep. Forgive me... They sent her away... They sent her away... Maria... - I knew that? - No. sleep. I'm leaving! You are restless! Highness! At where? Where are you going? The wedding ring of S�o Luis. - Read what's inside. - January 13, 1889. � today! U... P... A... A... A... M... "United by love until death." Funny! I never thought of Venice in the rain. From now on, I'll just remember it that way. - I love this weather. - Looks like a happy child... Rain is not sad. It's so light and it dances... - Don't you cry? dance. - I wouldn't say that. I know what people say about snowflakes. They dance like a ballet. But I don't. I think like... sleep, a deep sleep, and the snow... but the rain is so happy. Listening... Maria is love, and sleep, I think I love you... intensely. Now I know I love you. You are in my thoughts... only you... Remember I once told you one night before I fell asleep, I know that the next day I will see you? Last night, I knew. - Leave some light, please! - I'm shy. Seriously, I'm shy. There has to be some light. I'm afraid of the dark. My love, my love... I'll never know what shyness is again. - Who gave you permission to leave? - Nobody. I'm an adult. I have my passport. As Inspector General, you are not authorized to leave the country. - I resigned from my commission before I left. - And I refused to accept your resignation. - Consequently, you risk a court-martial! - Then present me in court-martial! This is it! Your letter to the Pope requesting an annulment! ...of a wedding that made me laugh all over Europe! My letter to the Holy Father is my business and no one else's! For me, the Pope and the Archbishop of Vienna are mere chaplains for the family. I will not tolerate either you or anyone else interfering with our work, priest or not priest! And then, your request rejected by Rome! Can you humiliate us even more? - Were you told they refused? - It wasn't necessary. They decided. They kept me informed, like the head of the family. As for me, I will never allow your involvement with this woman, this Vetsera. And never come back again after setting foot in this Empire! Your S�lo? As much as your Holy Roman Empire! You can have your ministers prepare the documentation. Before this month is over, I will renounce my titles and leave this country... ...once and forever. - What if I don't accept your abdication request? - What about the passport, if it's taken? - You can take it a step further. Prisons are full, I'm sure Count Taafe can find room for one more. I leave it to you, to the judgment of your mistress... and her family... to whom it has only brought ruin and shame. And to your lover's children. Bastards! That they will suffer humiliations wherever they go. With the blood of the Habsburgs. More bastards. To be treated as inferiors who would only have a superior debt. The mercy of marriage. I leave you to judge what I told you and what you have now, have you forgotten what you have? Children with the knowledge that their father is a an adulterer in his private life, and a traitor in his public cause! These men out there are of all races. Croats, Slovenians, Czechs, Magyars. Their wages are low, they are far from home, but if I give the order, there isn't one of them who doesn't give his life for me! Did you speak seriously with what you said before, that Maria could not return to this country? I don't want to harm her or her family. It is up to you to decide the damage that may happen to her and her family. She was willing to let him see her, for a few days, perhaps. If I had known that afterwards, they would never meet again. - You don't believe I love her. - I don't believe this is important! Until the end of the month, can I spend some time with her? Neither polycias nor espines. If I have your word. You have my word. I have to sleep every night. Where are we now? Mayerling. They don't have a straight flight like in Scotland, MacAlish. You don't shoot right like you do in Scotland, Your Highness. Filth! � the light! It's late nights and foreign wines instead of whiskey at reasonable hours. fights! Ah! It's horrible! I hate this! I hate this! Something I will never be able to share! This kill! When I was little, my father thought I was a man, because he liked... to look at animals and study modern killing. Now I kill. Highness, to the right! On the edge of the forest... no! Please no! She is so cute. I shouldn't. - I must say, it doesn't make it easy for hunters. - Not my intention. - What else do you want me to do? - Anything. - Nothing I can't do either. - Your Highness! Some friends of ours have just arrived unexpectedly. - Johan... - Karoli and I have just arrived from Hungary. Your Highness, tomorrow is the biggest demonstration... that Budapest has ever seen. Do you know what they're painting on the banners, and scoreboards? "Prince Rudolf of Austria to our King." Now it's time Your Highness, you have to speak. Hoyos, you are Hungarian. Tell him what that means. Karoli is here. This is the only way for Hungary to remain in the Empire. It's an attitude! It's an attitude, now! And what happens if the Emperor sends his army to Hungary? Civil war! But with you there, as king, or viceroy, however you want to call yourself... Who are those men? They are friends. Whose friends? Ours. Come and meet them. Come, and greet them. Come and tell them you're with us. What are they called? One day, maybe, join us. I just hope it's not too late. Rudolf! Rudolf! I just killed, which must be the biggest... and wildest wild boar seen around here. Congratulations, but... I'm going back to Vienna to see my father. Take Maria to my apartment in Schnbrunn. Wait there for me. But there's the ball tonight, in honor of the Prince of Wales. - I want the Vetsera family to be invited. - But Rudolph... I think you've been complaining to your friends about not being received in the Court. Well, tonight will be. Crazy! Like all the Habsburgs? Completely, raving and mad! - Come... Come here, come here... - What do you think you get with this? This is for the animals we adopt. Oh! It's so beautiful, so peaceful. - Remember what I told you? Snow? - Yes, sleep soundly. I remember. And the rain, always dancing. why? Why, what? your sigh. Your deep breath. It was the thought of Vienna. Despite my mother's presence, I will return to C�rte. Am I not somehow making you unhappy? - It's my style! - It's good, because... I've never been so happy. And I only wish that God twice bless me. First have someone to love. And the second? To be loved by the one I love. - Would you like some more tea? - No, thanks, Loschek. Although the cookies were delicious, they are so bad in appearance. Then there is nothing else that Your Lordship desires. Just say one thing. - How long have you been with the Archduke? - Since he was twelve. - You were so lucky! - Not when I was 12. It was unbearable. - You are very fond of him. - Like you. If I may be free, Your Ladyship, I am very fond of Your Highness. It was a beautiful thing to say. Thank you, Loschek. Loschek! Can Your Highness announce me? It's impossible. Await the Emperor, Your Majesty. Just tell him I dropped by unexpectedly, so he can see how he's doing. Loschek, can you please put this in the water. Well, since I'm here, I have to leave you a message. Ah, forgive me, for bothering you. Loschek, you should have told me! And now leave us alone. I wanted to know how my son was. I see him so little. How does he look to you? You look a little worried, Your Majesty. Tired out. Poor Rudolph. He was not the man for this life imposed on him. I often wonder if anyone will be? I never met you, mademoiselle. I go out so little now. But I know my son loves her. Please sit... You are even more beautiful than I was told. It's so young! - How old are you? - I'm twenty, madam. Twenty! At twenty, I... was already unhappy, but, it was my wish not to die. Vienna is not for young people. Stay away if you can. - I like the countryside better, Your Majesty. - Me too, Rudolf and also his father. Or that we are not, we have to be what they want us to be. At home the children play Kings and Queens, We played shepherds, sometimes even... ...circus performers. Listen! Wait long enough to hear a door slam, a servant dropped a spoon... No, never, or what we decided, you are never completely alone. However, we are always very lonely. You know what he told me the day he got married? He said, "Mother, say a prayer for me." And I said, "What prayer should I pray for you?" And he said, "Pray to God that I never fall in love." Let me kiss you, my daughter. You will be in my heart. - Good night, Helen. - Goodnight. - Baroness Vetsera seemed very nervous to me. -She was never received in the Court before... and suddenly she was invited to a dance, no wonder! - Will she know why? - My mother was always the last to know. The grace of your presence was a well-kept secret, Elizabeth. Until the last moment, even I myself wasn't sure. You know I've been away, now that I'm getting older I should go home... Absurd! We must always keep close to our friends. Has the world ever seen a more beautiful Empress? How nice. I was no longer used to it. But you can't, distract yourself... dance a little. Taaf... - Yes Your Majesty? - Music, please. If you are going to open the dance sir, I must ask my mother for the second dance of the night. Your father and I have to talk. - I'm sure you can replace your father. - As a dancer, you can always take my place. - My dear, could you... - I'm looking forward to talking to you, But there are some things we can't discuss in public. Baroness Vetsera, may I ask your permission for your daughter, Maria... may you do me the honor of opening the ball. Do I have your authorization? If His Imperial Highness insists... - Your Majesty, I can't... - Keep calm! Don't forget that you are an Archducal of Austria. - Oh, how much longer? - Mary, look at me. Maria... now smile. Smile. I want people to see us. That's better. Now say something. Good evening, Your Highness. Goodnight My Love. �, take me away... Please... Take me away... This will not last. I give you my word. It will not be allowed to last. Your Majesty, allow me to introduce you to Baroness Maria Vetsera, whose fate has been a matter of great interest to you. You are very beautiful, Baroness. And your youth... give him the rights to expect everything from life. Her Majesty is kind. The Baroness and I have already met. I trust that our sympathy was mutually sincere. Her Majesty is really kind. I will return now. Maybe he'll come visit me before you go. But not if it's too late. Good night. I'm proud of you, Maria. Heavens, how proud I am of you! I hope one day we have children and they can be proud of you. holes! Edward... I need your help. You have to let me go to England. My dear friend, for a state visit a reason is needed. It's not a state visit, it's to live there, forever. When you think of England, you see the white cliffs of Dover. I see an old lady, but what problems does she drag in her private life, politically... But one day you will be the king! And then... Not even then will I be able to receive you at my private parties, to which I like to invite all those I want. Where can I go? What can I do? You have to do the same thing I will do tomorrow night. - And what is that? - Back to my wife. Bringing the relationship openly public is crazy. - It's complete madness! - I did it for a reason. Showing the relationship openly, and in plain sight, means that... I never have to hide it under the rug like a lazy maid again. And now your father is more determined than ever! But how is it possible to resist his eyes? That child is truly a marvel. And I was counting on it, to teach someone a lesson. Especially someone with Madame Du Barry habits. You should give him more time. I'm sure I could wait for anything. Anything like my dad's deal with Katarina Schratt? No thanks! I want marriage, children, nothing like a dirty romance hidden away in a corner. - Marriage, and nothing else! - I wish it only brought disaster to this life. It's a night for compassion, humanity. Because if I didn't want to, I wouldn't stay in Vienna to share your bed, I have no right to ask, no mind for an unnatural life of celibacy. I know this marriage you want, even a morganic marriage... I will have! I will not deprive myself. � wedding or... Or what, my son? He's a child when he talks like that. I tell you mom, if they control me, they end up taking me too far... Do you think your father doesn't know what he does to you? What are you doing to yourself? Because in your stubbornness you are practically the same man. What he thinks is wrong, you think too, my love. And get away from those windows. You die of pneumonia. Or I die. Mother, I say this to you, and to no one else. There is only one last hope left for me. Hungary. They want me for their King. I could go now... I don't want to hear anymore, but hear me! Hear what I say. Get the girl out of the country! And hurry! They can send it wherever... wherever they want to send it, and never come back. You know that in this family nothing is out of the question. Are you listening to me? I heard. I have to go now. Thanks for what you're trying to do. And tell the little one that I truly love him, because she truly loves him. Remember that story I told you about never falling in love? And now I fell in love. And I am a very happy man. No, no, you're not that... but you're a very good man. - Good night, mother. - Farewell, my son. highness Your Highness... Excuse me for coming here, Your Highness, but I have to leave tonight. - Maybe it's already too late. - You can't afford to be. Your orders are for Karoli to delay the uprisings in Budapest until next week, until I can get there. And will you agree that we announce that you will be King of Hungary? It is the only way to make Hungary remain in the Empire. I suppose all men must justify their own reason. Karolj insists on his signature on this proclamation. And, as proof, that you give me your ring. I suppose the pencil signature is legal. - This one is just for Karoli to see. - Don't take my word for it anymore. Your Highness! I can't say I blame him. Go as fast as possible. I don't want a revolt with no one to lead. Won't you change your mind? Are you sure? This is extremely serious. Someday everything will become extremely serious. Hoyos, don't waste time. See you soon. To Budapest! Thank God! I'm so glad to be back in Mayerling. So did I... it was a terrible night. - Maria. - Yea. - Do everything for me? - Yea. And you? I just did. Are you trying to kill us? Continues! Get out! Books? - You mean, are we free to go? - Yes, they are. At the moment. By ... by the way, Count Hoyos. I thought I should return this to the owner! - So, Count Taafe let him go? - Why not? The Budapest uprising is over. You must know. There's nothing left to do. Did you find out what happened? Count Taafe had six battalions, ready and waiting. Hundreds of ammo boxes for each soldier. And the officers were not Hungarians. It wasn't just a defeat, it was a massacre. - Prince Johan? - Nobody knows where. - Karoli? - He committed suicide. Taafe returned the ring, but not the statement that was attached. He still has the papers. I wonder if a pencil signature will be legal? What we will never know. What did Karoli say that day? "One day, maybe you'll join us." - Do I have to wait then, until you come back? - It would be a long, long time. - An impossible time to wait. - Better yet, I'll go with you. What if that's impossible? Impossible how? I followed you everywhere. It's not allowed, I can't let you go. Another, Bratfisch, another. - Loschek, get yourself a glass. - Your Majesty... Come, I want you to drink with me. Your Highness, it's not something I should say... but when you ask me to drink with you, gave me the freedom to talk to you man to man, then as a prince's servant. You know the many years I've been with you. I've never seen him so happy as tonight. With your permission, Your Highness I drink the... the...! For all these years you've been with me, Luscheck, It's the first time something has broken. Second time, Your Highness. Have you forgotten how you shot a razor that hit the mirror? Are you trying to tell me something, but still not saying. Let me say it for you. If you leave, it doesn't matter where, But if it is, I'm never coming back. Have you ever thought about what will happen to me...? wandering around the world? Alone? A strange world, a lonely place, because it won't be there. Why can't I be. They won't let me live with you, and I won't want to live without you. I understand. And I've always been trying to make you realize that I understand. My God, why can't anyone understand how much I love you? Good night my friends. Until the next time we meet, may God keep you. Just the thought of the dark... Nothing more. What are you doing? I ended up anyway. Must be the heat in the fireplace... my eyes... can't stay open. - Sleep then. - I don't want to. Not yet. I can't help it, you know? You know, if you want to change your mind, you still have time. Never without you. would not live. Just one thing please... Yes? I don't... I don't want to know... when. I'm scared. Not much, but scared. - Me too. - You have no reason to be. I am with you... always will be. I shouldn't feel lonely. much less just... in the dark. That's why... I am the happiest man in Austria, I will adapt to be the luckiest. We are both fortunate for one thing, it's nice to be able to say to someone: "I will adore you forever," and you know that's true. Eternally... I think like you. You were my first love... I would... sincerely like to see you, one last time. Remember what I used to tell you. A few nights before falling asleep, I know that the next day I will see you. Yes... I know I will see you. - At� amanh�, ent�o. - Amanh�... I think I'd like to sleep now. Goodnight My Love. Maria Vetsera... I love you forever. Forgive me, Your Highness. I thought I heard a shot. I didn't shoot it, Loschek. Some... game wardens... in the woods... You are probably right, Your Highness. Excuse me.
