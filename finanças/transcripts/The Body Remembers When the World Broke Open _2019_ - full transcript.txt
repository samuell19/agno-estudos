[city bus rumbling] [bus stops and starts] [door hisses open] [baby fussing] [young mother, softly] Let's get on the bus. [baby cries] Let's sit down. [young mother gasps] Oh, no. Here you go. [young mother] Thank you. [young mother] Ready, driver. [baby repeats] "Ready, driver!" [baby babbles and giggles] [cord bell dings] [humming softly] [train rattling below] [continues humming tune softly] [humming continues] [stops humming] [door squeaks] [man talking on phone] [girls chat and giggle] [elevator bell dings] [button clicks] [doors rumble shut] [bell dings, doors rumble open] [overhead lights buzzing] [music thudding from next door apartment] [man talking on phone] Yeah, I'll get it. I'll fucking get it to you. Don't worry about it. [slips off shoes] [television playing] [Gladys] Rosie dear, can you get me a Coke? Yup. Here you go. [Gladys] Look at this. It's funny, eh? It's a classic, eh? [thudding from bedroom] [man shouts] Fuck you! [growls angrily] [man swearing and slamming drawers] [Gladys] Did you get his cigarettes? Mm-hmm. [man continues muttering and cursing] [thudding and slamming intensifies] [man roars, approaching] Rosie! [intercom beeps] [office phones ring] The doctor will be right in. Okay. [unzipping boots] [paper crinkling] [knock on door] [door opens] Good afternoon. "Eh-la," is it? Áila. [doctor] "Eye-la." Is that Polynesian? It's Scandinavian. Oh, is that right? Mm. So, your pregnancy test came back negative. Any history of STIs to your knowledge? When was the last time you were tested? Um, at my last pap, like, a year ago. Any instances of unprotected sex since then? Just with the same partner. Have you had any other sexual partners? Are you on any medication right now? Um... Alesse, and Cipralex. Ativan, if it gets bad. If what gets bad? Um, the anxiety. Any history of pregnancy? Um, I had an abortion. When was this? Eight years ago. Are your periods fairly regular? Yup. Heavy flow? I don't know, I don't think so. And this is your first IUD? Yes. Okay, so these are good for up to three years. You're 31? Mm-hmm. Okay, if you're thinking about children, I would consider it now. [chair wheels squeak] I'm gonna get you to lie back now for me. Yeah, that's it. [door opens] [nurse] Hello again. [door closes] [chair wheels squeak, medical gloves rustling] [doctor] And just relax your knees a bit more for me. Thank you. You're going to feel a little pressure here. It's just like a regular pap. Mm-hmm. [nurse] Could at least warm it up for you, eh? [tap water running] [doctor] Going to feel a little pinch. [inhales sharply] [doctor] We're almost done here. And that's it for us. [chair wheels squeaking] So you may have some cramping or spotting. That should ease up quickly. If you have any pain in the next couple days, please come back and see us. [chair wheels squeaking] [door opens and closes] [nurse] We'll get you to rest here until you're ready, but take your time. Pad or tampon? Pad. [door opens and closes] [city traffic bustles outside, sirens wail] [horns blare] [roar of traffic] [train rattling below] [man screams distantly] Rosie! [rain pouring] [seagulls call overhead] [man across the street] Rosie, you bitch! [Rosie quietly sobs] [man screaming in rage] My mother's up there crying her fucking eyes out! Hey... Um, are you-- are you okay? [man shouting] Rosie! Can I help you? [man shouts] I barely touched you! I just ran-- What's that? I just ran. [man screams in rage] Rosie! Do you want me to call the police? No. No? Um... [man shouts] Do you know that guy? That's my boyfriend. I just ran-- Um... Do you want to, um... Do you want to maybe just like walk with me for a bit? Yeah? Come on. It's okay. [man screams] You're one fuckin' dead girl! Come on. Um... Do you, uh, do you live around here? No. It's all right. Let's... Let's maybe move a little faster, okay? [boyfriend shouts] Rosie! Don't you dare fuckin' leave! Come on, honey, it's okay. [boyfriend screaming] Fuck you! I got you. Come on. [traffic still roaring] [boyfriend's shouts receding] Rosie! Let's go a bit faster, all right? [car alarm blaring and honking] Excuse me. Are you okay? Um... you're bleeding. Um, do you think maybe I should call an ambulance? -No. -No? Okay. Um, are you sure you don't want to go to the police? Are you fuckin' deaf or something? Sorry. Look, um, my place is... my place is just around the corner. Um... do you want to come inside? [dog barking] I don't think he's behind us, but I think we should keep moving. Do you want to come inside? Yeah? Okay. We're almost there. [rain pouring from spouts] I got you. Okay, come on. Doing okay? All right, watch your step here, hey? [breathing hard] [rain pouring] Just up these steps, all right? [car races past, tires squealing] [Áila unlocks front door] Okay, just up here. Come on in. [dog barks] [man, to dog] Come on. Hey. [Áila] Hi. [man] You okay? [Áila] Yeah. [man] See you. [Áila] Yeah, see you. [man, to dog] Come on, Brucie! [closes front door] Sorry about that. It's... just upstairs. [feet climbing stairs] [keys jangling] Come on up. [opens apartment door] Sorry about the mess... [dishes clatter] You're soaked, hey? I won't touch anything. It's all right. I got you a towel, and, uh... I'll get you a dry... something dry to put on. [Rosie] You don't have to. [breathing hard] [breaths shaking] [breathing steadies and slows] Sorry. Here you go. I'm not taking my clothes off. Uh... that's not what I mean. Um... you can change in the bathroom, if you want. It's all right. You'll probably feel better once you're cleaned up. [slides door shut] [spits] [turns on faucet] [turns off faucet] [tears off toilet paper] [faint heartbeat thumps] You gave me a scare there. [Áila] Hey, you doing okay in there? Yeah. Um... [pills rattle] [slides door] [text message notification chimes] [Rosie] The pants might not stay up. Um... Here, let me put those in the dryer for you. Thanks. [dryer humming] Hey, I thought you might be hungry. Always hungry these days. Yeah? [kettle whistling] You want some tea or something? Yeah. Um, what kind-- what kind do you like? Um, I don't... I don't really know. Um... Mint? You like mint? [sliding cupboard open] It's the good stuff from my grandma back home. Yeah, sure. So, where are you from then? Why? Just asking. Some people feel they gotta talk all the time, hey? I was born in Port Hardy. Is that right? [Rosie] Just popped out there like that. Yeah? You're a... You're a long ways from home then. So, um, you're Kwakwaka'wakw? My mom was. [toaster pops] You grew up on the rez? -No. -No? You, uh... You got family there still? My grandparents. Here's that tea... and, uh, I made you a... I made you a bagel. You all right with cream cheese? -Yeah. -Yeah? Here you go. I got your tea. [sighs] [sighs] So, what do you think you want to do then? I dunno. Just finish this, then I can go. No, you don't have to go, I just mean, um... I mean, like, for the night, you know? Like, a place to stay? I told you I don't want any cops. No, uh, I mean like, um, like, a shelter? You know, like, a place to stay for a while? Mm-mm. Okay... Well, um... Let's just wait for your clothes to dry at least, okay? So, um, it's Rosie? I'm Áila. I'm not gonna pray. Okay. I'm not into that shit. [Áila chuckles] You think I'm trying to save your soul or something? What's funny about that? Nothing. You just remind me of my sister, that's all. She's always a skeptic. [sighs] Uh... So, you got anybody looking out for you, Rosie? I look out for myself. And the baby? You work for MCFS? Mm-mm. I think you got your period. You're gonna get it on your couch. Fuck. Sorry. [bathroom faucet running] [bathroom door slides open] [sighs] Did you, um, think you were pregnant or something? No. So, where are you from then? Um, I'm from the Blood reserve, in Alberta. My mom's Blackfoot, and my dad is Sámi. [Rosie] Hmm. Like in Ontario? No, it's, um... You know, like the reindeer herders in Scandinavia? [Rosie] Um, is that like on Discovery Channel? Yeah. [Rosie] Are they, uh, they Native? Mm-hmm. [Rosie] Are you into white guys or something? Oh. [chuckles] No, that's Ben. Um, he is Native, though. [Rosie] Everybody's Native these days, hey? Is he your lover? Um... yeah. I guess you could call him that. Yeah, I don't like the word "boyfriend," I like to say "lover." Yeah? How come? Is he from your same place? No, he's, uh, he's from here. Musqueam. It's... Well, the reserve's, like, right in the city, so... it's pretty different from back home. Do you guys, um, have a baby together? No. Do you want to? Um... I don't know. He does. He wants to be a dad. You know, maybe he'll just leave you. Find someone who wants a family. Maybe. I don't know, it's just, it's a lot, hey? Being a mom? My sister's really good at it, but... I dunno. Do you get along with your sister? Yeah, mostly. Do you have any siblings? I've got a half-sister. Oh, yeah? Is she older or younger? She's older. Did you guys grow up together? Not really. Hmm. Do you get along? Um... I dunno. Well, um, do you think you could maybe stay with her? I think I should just go. Um... Well, I... I would just feel better if we could call someone, you know? Like, call someone who knows about this kind of stuff. What stuff? [sighs] Well... about, you know, like, experiencing abuse. You sound like my case worker. She's fuckin' always getting up in everybody else's business. She's just a dumb cunt. Geez, you got a mouth on you, hey? Only sometimes. I woke up today and thought maybe today I talk. Some days, I don't even talk at all. Do you still have a case worker? I turned 19, so that's it. But at least they leave me alone. Look, I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna call one place, all right? [sighs] Oh, hi, uh... I'm calling because-- Well, on behalf of a young woman who I'm with who needs a safe place to stay... [voice fades to murmur] ...Do you guys have like a waitlist? Um... really? [children laugh and play outside] Well, yeah, tonight. I mean, she's been assaulted by her partner, so... Okay. Yeah. Well-- Okay... Yeah, I understand. Thanks anyway. [Áila, entering room] They're, uh... they're full. My grandma, she used to listen to this. Yeah? You, uh... you know how to work one of those? I think so. Hello? Hi. Hi, yeah, I'm calling... I'm calling because I'm with a young woman who...

What's it feel like in there? Wanna feel? Sure. Um... do I just-- Here. [chuckles awkwardly] Okay. So... this is his bum. [faint heartbeat thumps] A little bit more... There. And, um... I'm pretty sure this is his head. [Joni Mitchell still plays faintly in headphones] It's so-- [cell phone rings and vibrates] Oh, sorry. [cell phone ringing and vibrating] Hello? Hi, um... Yeah, that was me. Oh, really? Okay, yeah, um... Sure, no, I understand. Yup. Um... we can hop in a cab right away. Sure, okay. Uh... Great, um, yeah, we'll be there soon. Thank you. Um, hey. There's a... There's a safe-house. It's not too far from here, and they actually have a space, um... We'd have to kind of go right away, so... What do you think? I'd have to go now? Well... What about tomorrow? There might not be a space tomorrow. It's okay. Just-- I'll go. We could, um, we could just check it out, you know. Like, maybe go and see what it's like? Maybe. Are you feeling scared? No. Okay. Just maybe I don't wanna fucking go. I have to pee. [calling phone number] Hello. Uh, yeah, I can... Hi there, um... Can I get a cab to, uh, 157 Pandora, please? Um, yeah, it's an apartment. Great, um, thank you. [bathroom door slides open] Uh... just in case. I said I didn't want to go. I know, but-- Can I just get my clothes back? They're... They're not quite dry, so... You know, he doesn't even mean it mostly. I'm not trying to tell you what to do. Then what are you trying to do? I'm just trying to help. Well... We gotta make a stop on the way, all right? Okay. What kind of stop? It's just a friend. Owes me money. It's kind of a co-worker. Yeah? Okay. Um... What size are your feet? Uh, they're nine, but my feet are swollen. I also can't get the socks on. Ah... Okay. Um, let me help you put these on. Sit down. [sighs] Here. You're lucky you didn't step on any glass. You'll probably have to wear a pair of Ben's shoes. Hold on. I'm sorry, but... these are going to have to do. Let me get you a jacket. Here you go. Um... I can't go out like this. I look really cheap. [chuckles] Yeah. You, uh, you kinda do, but... you don't really have a choice. It's not like a fashion show or anything. Um, can you grab my purse, please? Thank you. So, where do we find this co-worker? Um... It's on the way. Yeah? You don't know where we're going. It's not that far from here, anyways. Okay. Cab should only be a couple minutes. Um, so this place that we're going, it's, um, it's a safe house, so the address is a secret, right? So once we get there, you can't be telling anybody where it is, you understand? So, you think it's gonna be a boy? Um... probably. He always is in my dreams. You got a name? Guess we'll find out when he comes. So, um... so where do you work then? Um... Cab's here. Hi. [talk radio plays quietly] You all right? Yeah. Um, hi. We're going to 450 Napier Street. Okay. Um, we gotta make a stop first. Can you just turn left up there? [Áila tapping into smart phone] [text message notification chimes] [driver] Okay, sorry, where was that stop at? Oh, it's just on the corner of Clark and... on the corner of Clark and Pender. [text messages chimes] [text message chimes] [driver] So, how's your day going? It's been a tough day, actually. [driver] Yeah. [text message chimes] You know, my sister here, she's pretty much decided to go to rehab. It's been a long time coming, so it's like a big deal, I guess. [driver] Oh, yeah. Yeah, it is. I've been there. I've been a friend of Bill for coming up on, what is it, 15 years now. Cool. [text message chimes] Yeah. You know, I'm really proud of you, sis. It's a big step. Takes a lot of guts giving up drinking and everything, and you know, getting your life back together after all those big mistakes. [driver] You know, we all make 'em, right? So good for you. You know, it's changed my life for the better. Yeah? [taxi dispatch radio crackles] You know, Mom would be really proud, too, if she was still here, Yeah. Too bad, like, she's not alive. It's a good thing I've got your back, though, huh? [Áila] Yeah, geez. I don't know what I'd do without you. [driver] Sisters, eh? [Áila] Yup. Yeah, you wouldn't think it, though, huh? [driver] You don't look like sisters. Yeah, well, she pretty much takes after our dad. Um, he's white. He had real hairy arms, kinda like you... and our mom, she's, um, straight-up Bawkwuam. You know what that is? [driver murmurs politely] It means "native" in our language. Oh, yeah? Yeah. [Rosie chuckles] Our folks met at a gas station. [driver] You're kidding. For real? [Rosie] Yeah. [chuckles] Mom, she, uh, pulls up in her Honda, and was like, "Fill 'er up..." [chuckling] and there's Dad, pumping her gas. He was like, "Do you want me to wash the windows, too?" It's like love at first sight, you know? [driver] Mm-hmm. [Áila] Yeah. [sighs] But, um, a few years later, the government, they shipped-- they shipped our dad off to Afghanistan. He died in combat. [driver sighs sadly] Wow... Yeah. My sister has never really stopped drinking since. That's how it all happened. [driver] I'm sorry for your loss. It must have been tough on you girls. Yeah. Very. [driver] It's somewhere here, I think, right? Oh, yeah. It's just on the corner right there. [driver] Right here? Yeah, just right here. I'll be quick. Promise. Okay, we have to hurry. Do you want me to come in with you? Or... No, it's all right. [driver] You know, quitting drinking was one of the best decisions I ever made. Yeah? Um... Do you mind just waiting here for a sec? Okay, just gotta keep the meter running. Yeah, that's fine. We'll be right back. Oh, hold the door. [man coughing] Thanks. [country music echoing] [fluorescent lights buzz] [Rosie] Thanks. [man] No worries. [fluorescent lights buzz] [country music echoing] [roar of traffic and road construction] [Áila sighs] We're good. [heavy rain on car roof] [taxi dispatch radio crackles] They're not gonna let you in with that. [Rosie] With what? What's in the bag, Rosie? It's my stuff. What stuff? It's none of your business. It's just my clothes and stuff. Yeah? Yeah. Come on, Rosie, just-- Don't touch my shit. Fine. Forget it. Just chill the fuck out. You chill out. Didn't even wanna fucking go. Rosie... Look, are you taking something? I'm not gonna get mad, I just... I just want you to tell me. Are you taking something? Rosie, please, just tell me the truth. Did you just buy something? It's none of your fuckin' business. Do you know what that can do to a baby? You think you're better than me? No. You're not fuckin' better than me. I didn't say that-- I can take care of myself, and I can take care of my kid. Stop the car. [Áila] Hey, come on. Don't stop the car. Thanks. I wanna get out of the fucking car. [driver] We're almost there. [Rosie] I just wanna go home. [driver] So, stop or don't stop? Just keep going. Sorry, she's just being dramatic. Sister stuff. I'm not your fucking sister. [Áila] Look, I never said I was better than you. You didn't have to. You think you're so fuckin' smart? I think you don't know shit. You're just a dumb white bitch. [Áila] If he's hitting you, what makes you think he's not gonna hurt the baby? No one's touching him without me saying it's okay. Not even breathe on him. Yeah? But you don't even really know what he's capable of. You don't know anything about me. I know a little. [driver] Okay... That'll be $16.70, ma'am. Will that be cash or card? [Rosie] As if I'd take shit. [Rosie opens car door] [driver sighs heavily] Hey, actually, um, I'm not getting out here. Okay, but I can't leave until she closes that door. All right. Rosie, can you close the door, please? What the fuck? You said you'd come with me. Yeah, I don't like being lied to. I'm not going in there then. [Áila] Just go inside. [driver] Ladies, I don't have all day. I just sold some stuff. I'm not using. [driver] You need the machine? Hang on. [Áila muttering] Fuck. I'm sorry, I must have left my wallet at home. Um... [driver] Come on... [Áila] Look, it's not what you think it is. Can I just-- Can I just call? Um, I could get someone to bring my wallet-- Here. Here. S-sorry about that. Here's your change. I just sold some stuff. I swear I'm not using. I think it's this one. [vacuum cleaner whirring inside] [knocks] [vacuum cleaner shuts off] [exhaling wearily] Period cramps? Hey. Are you Áila? Yeah. Hi. Hi. This is Rosie. Hi. I'm Cat. Come on in. [Cat] Are you all hungry? There's probably still some of Sophie's nachos left over if you're interested? [Rosie] Sure. [Cat] Yeah? Great. She'll join us in a minute. Hey, is there a washroom I can use? [Cat] Yeah, it's through this door, just on your right. All right. Thank you. [Cat] Are you comfortable if Áila's in the room while we chat? [Rosie] Yeah. [sighs] [muttering] Fuck... [flushes toilet] [faucet running] [Cat] I like your tattoo. [Rosie] Thanks. [Cat] What does it say? [Rosie] "She gave me life." [Cat] Cool. [Rosie] I like yours, too. [Cat] Thank you. So, Rosie, how are you feeling? Looks like you've got some pretty big changes coming soon, hey? Is it your first? Are you excited? [Áila] She's, um... she's pretty tired, I think. Not really. [Cat] That's okay. We can... we can just relax for a while. [Sophie] Hey! Hi. [Áila] Hi. I'm Sophie. I'm Áila. Hi, Áila. This is Rosie. Hi, Rosie. It's nice to meet you. I come bearing snacks. [Sophie] Áila? No, thank you. [Sophie] You good? [Cat] I'm okay, thanks. [Sophie] Anything to drink? Some tea, or water? [Áila] No thanks. [Sophie] Okay. So... So, uh... I guess I should explain what happened? Or... [Cat] Okay. Okay, um, so... Well, I found Rosie-- I came across her standing in the street in the pouring rain, and, um... she didn't have any shoes on. She was... She was really upset. Like, really upset. [Cat] How come you weren't wearing your shoes, hon'? [Rosie] Didn't put them on. Were you in a rush to leave? Do you want to say why? Um... he tried to choke me... and I kicked him. That really pissed him off. [Cat] That you kicked him? Is that where you got the marks on your neck? No. That's from another time. [Sophie] Does he do stuff like that a lot? He can be good, too. [Sophie] What does he do when he's good? Buys me nice stuff. Brings me to the movies or whatever. [Sophie] But today he got upset? He thought I threw out his toothbrush. [Áila] His toothbrush? I didn't throw it out, um, I threw it in the toilet. [Sophie] How come? He told me I was getting fat. Um... so, uh.. So, I asked Rosie if I should call the police, but she said no, so... Because he's on bail. Well, wouldn't that be better? Because then they'd arrest him right away, and then you'd be safe. [Sophie] You're the one who's in control of what happens right now, Rosie. Do you want us to call the cops? [Rosie] No. [Áila] How come? [Rosie] They'll take him to remand, and besides, I don't like cops. I don't like the way they look at you. [Sophie] How's that? Like they're tired of lookin' at you. Like you're wasting their time. Can I actually get some of that water? [Cat] Yeah. Of course. [Sophie] Do you feel unsafe when you're at home? Um... I can't really brush my hair or anything. [Sophie] Why's that? He likes to push his knuckles into my scalp, like, really hard, until it's bruised and shit, and I don't really like that. [Cat] I can understand why you'd feel angry about that. That's why I look so rough, hey, can't even brush it, braid it, or anything. He says it's better that way, though, 'cause then his friends don't look at me like they want to fuck me. But as if they'd want to fuck me, all pregnant and shit... and as if I'd cheat on him. You shouldn't frown so much, you might get stuck that way. [Sophie] What about family? Do you have any in town? No. [Áila] Um, her grandparents live in Port Hardy. [Cat] Oh, yeah? I'm from McNeil. Oh. [Cat] Do you think you'd want to make your way back home? Eventually. [Cat] Yeah, or maybe when the baby is born? Maybe when he's older. Like four or five? [Cat] How come only then? Don't think I can get a job or anything, and... I don't wanna be like one of those girls, you know, with a baby? [Cat] You're worried people might judge you on that? Yeah. [Cat] I get that. [Áila] Rosie, is this what you really want? The baby? You think he's gonna help take care of it? Doesn't matter. His mom's there. [Sophie] At his place? Oh. No, it's her place, but she stays in the living room. [Áila] And you think she's gonna help take care of it? Does she help when he gets upset? I watch TV with her, when I don't want to go to bed. I just pretend to sleep there, so I don't have to. [Cat] You think she knows what's been going on with him? I think she's scared of him. [Áila] You think so? The other day he said, "I wish you'd fucking got rid of it," and he was talking about the baby, hey. He kicked me in the tummy. We were in the other room, but the walls are pretty thin, you know? [Áila] And what did you do? Just laid there, pretending to be asleep, till he left. Like he was a bear. He knew I wasn't, but he left anyways. I'm not stupid. I'm gonna protect him. No one's taking my baby. [Sophie] Well, Rosie, right now all we want is for both of you to be safe. I have to pee. [Cat] It's through this door on your right. [Sophie] It's really important not to put any pressure on her. [Áila] I just feel like she's so young... [faint heartbeat thumps] [Rosie singing same melody she was humming earlier] ♪ Don't you know ♪ ♪ I love you so ♪ ♪ And Mommy will ♪ ♪ Never let you go ♪ ♪ To the stars ♪ ♪ In the sky ♪ ♪ You'll always be ♪ ♪ Mommy's little guy ♪ [humming tune gently] [sniffling] So, Rosie... if you were to stay here, you would have a room of your own with a lock on the door, and you'd be able to come and go as you please. The one important thing to remember, though, is you can't tell anyone the address, and you can't bring anyone back here, unless it's someone who needs our help. Do you understand why that's so important? Yeah. Okay, good. A couple of other things to know is, um, there's no drug or alcohol use allowed in the home. The food is shared, and we split up the cooking and the cleaning, and we have counselling services, and employment resources to offer. We can help you with any medical or hygiene supplies you might need. Are you a counsellor? Sort of, but there is a counsellor in the house who's got a little more experience than me if there's ever anything you need to talk through. Um... I'd get my own room? [Cat] Yeah. You wanna see it? Okay. Okay, follow me. So you can put up pictures and stuff if you want, posters... anything really. It's nice. Yeah, the bed is really comfortable. How long would I stay? As long as it takes to figure some stuff out. Some people are here for a week, some for a couple months. It's up to you. In the summertime, we get to do some gardening. There's a lot of veggies out there. Shouldn't be too long now. Cool. [Rosie sighs] I feel like a whale. [chuckles] I'll give you a minute in here by yourself, okay? Okay. [sniffles] [Áila] So, what did you think? Um... it's a nice room. Yeah? [Rosie] Yeah. So, how do you feel about it, Rosie? Think you'd like to stay for a while? Um... I don't have any of my stuff. [Sophie] Look, if you think you want to go get your stuff, we could hold your room. It's not a problem. [Áila] Yeah, I could, um, I could go with you. No, he wouldn't like that, if I did that. [Áila] Okay, what about-- what about tomorrow? Could I go with you tomorrow? Maybe when he's out? Maybe. Or maybe I should just go home. [Sophie] You mean to your grandparents? No. [Áila] Rosie... no. I think I might have exaggerated a bit, about what I said earlier? [Sophie] Do you think you exaggerated? [Rosie] Yeah. That's okay. We'd still love it if you could stay. Just for a break? Having a baby is a lot of work. Maybe you need some time to yourself for a while? Where you can feel safe? I didn't... I didn't ask to come. He's not usually like that. [Sophie] Do you think he might hurt you again? If I go now, he won't have to know any of it. [Áila] What about the baby? [Sophie] You have yourself to think about, all right? What's important today is you and your safety. That's all we're worried about right now. [Cat] So, what do you say, can we make up a bed? No, I just wanna go home. [Sophie] Okay. That's okay. Do you think you can make your way all right? I can take her. Should I call a cab? Sure. [little boys running and squealing] [Cat, laughing] Uh-oh, we're under attack. [Sophie] It's all right. [kids laughing] I'm gonna get you! [boys' mom] Sorry. [Cat] Oh, that's all right. Um, we were just chatting. Jessa, this is Rosie, and this is Áila. Jessa's been staying with us for a little while. She's our resident baker. [Jessa] Hi. Hi. [Jessa] I'm sorry I interrupted you. That's okay. [Jessa] Boys, come on. [Cat] Bye, boys. [kids running playfully] [Cat] Um, so, Rosie, I'm gonna give this to you. It has our phone number on it. This is just in case you change your mind, okay? You can always come back tonight, if you change your mind. [Áila] Shit. Um... My wallet's gone, so... [Cat] Oh, I can give you another chit. Okay, thanks. [Sophie] Cab's already here. [Áila] Oh, okay. [Sophie] You're ready to burst, huh? [Rosie] For sure. [Sophie] Yeah? So you say it's a boy? [Rosie] Pretty sure. Feels like it. [Sophie] You've been keeping up with the doctor visits? [Rosie] Mm-hmm. [Cat] So here's that. [Áila] Thank you. [Cat] You're welcome. [Rosie] Um, thanks for the nachos. [Sophie] Anytime. All right. [Cat] Uh, this is pretty normal, you know? Yeah, which part? [Cat] It can sometimes take six or seven tries before they feel like they're ready. It's a start. All right. Thanks. Well, take care, ladies. Thanks for the visit. [Áila] Thanks. [driver] What is the address? It's 277 Campbell. [driver] Okay. Are you mad at me? No. We could get you a bus ticket. I could take you to the depot tonight. You could, I don't know, stay with your grandparents. No, that's all right. I'll be okay. Okay. [traffic horns blare, sirens wail] I think you're gonna be a good mom. Thanks. I think you'll be a good mom, too. [tearfully] Thanks. [sighs sadly] Hey, um... Do you have your keys? That's all right, I'll find my way in. Okay, um... Well, do you want me to wait here for a bit? No, it's all right. You've got that phone number still? Yeah. All right. Be careful. Hey... You can keep those. No, it's... it's all right. Um... They're a bit big on me. Um... So, take care? Thanks, I guess. Yeah. I'll see you soon? Maybe. [exhales] [driver] Do you have another stop? [Áila] Yeah. Um... We're going to 157 Pandora, but, um, can you just wait here for a minute? [driver] Okay... but could you close the door? Yeah. [driver] Are you ready? Okay? [Áila] Okay. Go ahead.
