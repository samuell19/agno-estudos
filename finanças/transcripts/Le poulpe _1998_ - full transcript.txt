My feet hurt in these shoes. I'm not feeling this church. Yeah, it stinks. These fucking shoes. Shit! Come on, help me. Son of a bitch! Another stupid clue. Stop that bullshit. So what do we do? It's over. Call the cops, I'm going to bed. These shoes are great. What the hell are you doing here? You could've warned me. I'm coming to end my night. What do you think? That you can ruin mine with no warning? Darling, let me in, I'm done in. You bore me, Gabriel. You're not all alone. And neither am I. HAIR SALON CHÉRYL CLOSED FOR STOCK TAKE BY THE LADY OF THE HOUSE The more we talk about it, the more we have. Do you agree? It's not that simple. It's like plane crashes. That's what I'm saying. The more we talk, the more we have. I already told you, asshole. That's what I said. There are countries without planes. Yeah, where there's no planes, there's no fires. Yeah. Here's the Octopus. Looks more like an eel from here. -There's no danger. -There he is again. That's the third time we've seen him. The security systems have worked well as planned. Yeah, as planned. One more time, against the partisan exploitation of these… Our kids will be born with two heads! Go to prison, you hippies! These idiots piss us off. My coffee? What's wrong with him? -Hi, Gérard. -Hi, Jean. -Mr. Jean. -That's right. The hairy one didn't let it happen. Two heads and four arms, I don't know where they get that bullshit from! Those are the kinds of things you can pull out when you're in shape. Because today… Say something! There's a lot of shining wits here. What? But… What are you on about? Oh yeah, great! It's a spoonerism! It's a play on words. A symbol, a meaning, semiotics. Yes, semiotics! -Hi, Castel. -Hi. Semiotics, my balls. You'd better off working, you layabout. I'd go down a small hill. If it's bills, you can drink across the street. It'll come to that, Ducon. You're full of shit! Come see here. Oh, shit, a storm is brewing. Freedom is a constraint. That's what you've been saying since we got together. We love each other, we do what we want and respect each other's freedom. I'd say turning up at mine at dawn without warning attacks my freedom. As for your sexist jokes about the salon inventory… I'd rather forget it. I rang the bell but there wasn't anyone. Still no answer! -She broke her femur neck. -Poor thing! -She must be suffering. -A martyr. After, she went down the stairs… It's from Morsang, where I went on vacation. "Morsang Council. Madam, we inform you that the individuals in the cemetery, have vandalized your grandparents' grave." -Shit! -Seven years of bullshit! Pay and then get out, I've seen enough of you! "We would be grateful if you would come to note the damages. We thank you, blah blah, regards." Will you come with me? -What about your job? -There's Sylvie and Vanessa. They're not smart but they'll manage for a day. It's not a good time right now. What are you looking for? Look at those nice shoes. Are you family? Yeah. The family's still a bit complicated. Where it starts, where it ends! Look, it surely happened to them by chance. I don't really believe in chance. I only believe in it. He's full of shit. You need to make yourselves heard. You need to… These are my third highlights in six months, TGA 22. It's really great, really, really great. I'm really happy. That's great. Yeah, it's great. Carry on and in six months we'll be calling you Kojak. You think? I only use TGA 22 to descale the toilets. Oh really? There's two tibias and some small bones missing from the grave. It's official. So? Well, it's key. If they took bones, they'll do it again. Do what again? Satan worshipers. They steal bones for their rituals. Like the Pygmies. I'm laughing, but it's not funny. As if that was all we had, with all the nuclear beards! It's a change from breathalyzers! It doesn't change anything. It just complicates it. Well, what can I do? I have a solution if you're up for it. What is it? I warn you, it's radical. Radical! Ah well, shit, then! -Do you think it's strange? -The Pygmies or the beards? People who attack power stations with electric guitars. I like guitars too. But I don't like beards. Except for Zed Zed Top, but that's not the same. Hats off to you. Solid. What about the Quatre Barbus? The Quatre Barbus? What's that bullshit? They're an old group. Ridiculous name! Quatre Barbus doesn't mean anything! -Still better than ZZ Top. -Zed Zed Top. Do you have your papers? That's going to be complicated. Your papers. Here. There you go, with taxes it's 6000 francs to pay within a month. 6000 for a cracked headstone? And the check must be made payable to the town hall. Oh no! If it's cash, I have to fill out a form! Yeah? You told me you lived in a café, but you claim you don't live there, nor are you the owner. -What are you doing there? -Is this really necessary? It's essential, I need a profession. Put "press officer". That's a girl's job. I know, but I kept the same job after my operation. What operation? It's like baldness, it's surprising at first, but you get used to it. I found this near the chapel. I don't know what it is. And I don't know why I'm giving it to you. If you come back, come see me. I'm enjoying this conversation. Say… Is there a hotel nearby? You'll have to see. You handle things pretty well for a press agent. Say thanks. To me. Two second class for Paris. When does it leave? It leaves in half an hour, change in Nantes, if not… If not what? If not, erm… I don't know. Do you know what this is? Are you a cop? Is that it? Not really, no. I can't get annoyed, I sit down all day. I'm talking nonsense. It's from Angernaud, it's a receipt from the Ecomuseum, where the submarine is. Whore! This guy is sick! Whore! Little bitch! I'll kill you! What if we took two or three days? Are you serious? Don't you have any old friends in the region? What about the shop? -You have two shampooers, don't you? -Oh no! They'll kill the Perez mother. You need to learn to delegate. Wait, Gabriel. Are you trying to involve me in one of your investigations? I warn you, don't rely on me. Do you hear me? I'm sick of your tales. You'll use it to buy some clothes. -Have you seen my clothes? -I'll help you choose. Fuck you! I'd like to meet your old friends. -Oh yeah? -Hmm. LIBERTARIAN COURIER Can you move your ass? That's it. Do I know you, fartface? Aren't you too hot? Why don't you take some clothes off? Yeah, naked fondue. Now you're going to suck me off. We're going to fuck her. That would surprise me. Carry on, pal, don't stop. Ammunition. -Bullet hole fever. -A suppository for each of them. Looks fun! I know a little hotel on the coast, not far from here. We'll be fine, you'll see. -Are you listening? -Hmm. Yeah, okay. Can you sort us out with a terrace on the port and two beers? Perhaps. …by our RTL colleagues. Do you know the town? A little. I came here 15 years ago. You don't forget it, it's like swimming or Frère Jacques. What are you in Angernaud for? You did right coming back, it bodes well. It means you're not dead yet. Angernaud is like a cemetery, deserves a look, but not worth the journey. Well, it's fun. Shit. This is not happening. There you go. Do you want a receipt? -Yeah, why not? -I don't have any. I'm out of them, I'll come with you. I'm warning you, Gabriel, I'm not staying here. It's interesting and it's there they have the pipes… -So? -So what? It's hard work this weekend. Yeah. When it's hard, there's no taxis. Excuse me, do you think Little Jérémie was taken? Will you leave us in peace? It's unbelievable that you can piss everyone off. What a shit stirrer! Can I get a refill? It's not possible, look at all these wrecks. Come on, you pay and we'll go. Go where? Aren't we fine here? Are you messing with me? Did you see the mess? Stop, don't say that. I like this place a lot. It's very typical. Well, stay if you want. I'm going to find a real hotel. And I'm going to buy some clothes. I'll finish your beer. Are you free? Can we go? Yeah, okay. Fucking boat. -Is the Ecomuseum nearby? -I'm talking to you! At the end of the dock. Answer me, asshole. He's a sick writer. Every year, the town hall invites him. He stays at the cultural center, upstairs in the building. But they knock it back here, as far as drinking, -they're all champions. -I don't care if he leaves, but pray for him -to come back. -Genius blossoms in humidity, like mushrooms. Yes, laugh you shit workers. Laugh, drink, because tomorrow, the ocean will take back its goods. A woman in every port and a pig in every woman. Where is the smart ass from? Scotland. When he arrived, he was bad for Muscadet, but you have to recognize… the guy works hard. I'm not a nit-picker. Me neither! It's the only way the cargo ships can get in. This shit goes up for at least ten minutes. Do you see the boat there, ball buster? When I saw it coming in a week ago, I knew that I'd leave with it. It's called Mary, isn't that a sign? I always wanted to go to Lomé. And from there… towards Zanzibar. Zanzibar via Lomé, bravo! Do you hear me, you bastard? The boat will leave and Thomas will be on it! What's going on? Get down, you asshole! You dirty bastard, what's this shit? He's very bold. This one's funny. If I may, it's size 16 years. Really? So? Not bad. -The t-shirt or my breasts? -Both. I'll take it if you show me yours. There's only one guide, Bernard. But that's already one too many. Can I talk to him? He's not here. The submarine is closed. I only look after the exhibition room. -Do you want to see it? -No, thanks. Fine. Where can I find this Bernard? He works in a restaurant in Locarn. The southern neighborhood in Angernaud. Locarn has 800 houses and 400 cafés. Big meeting with Marie-Jeanne Desanges… Come from 6 pm take part in the "Clean France" tombola. What's great is that you go in the tombs, and you see the mummies, it's really… Yeah. And you can go in the pyramids. It's great. Polikarpov I-16. Winner. -Lousy airplane. -Not as lousy as that. You had to have rage and balls to fly that lump of metal. -Is Bernard not here? -No. He comes when he wants, that one. You're not… a cop? By any chance? -No. -Good. Because you're never a cop by chance. Yes? -Sit down. -I'm not selling it. I'll see what I can do. I'm not selling it. Okay, bye. Hey, asshole! -Are you the caretaker of the suppository? -What suppository? -The submarine. -Screw you. -Don't get mad. -What are you doing? I'm on vacation here, I need a bit of affection. Now I want to punch you in the face. -What do you think? -You want to what? 6000 francs cash, that's what this trip to Morsang has cost me. I'm not Bernard, I want to help. Yes, you will help. -Fucking idiot! -You tell Bernard to be at the submarine tonight with the cash, okay? 6000 francs in cash. Bastard. Dirty bastard! He's full of shit. Poor dwarf. Are you taking the piss? I've been waiting for an hour. Where were you? Is it the carnival? What? Don't you like the pipe t-shirt? It's lame. And is this lame? No, that's okay. We have a room at the Ocean Hotel, and we're in this hovel. It's not a hovel, there's a blind. There's not even a TV. And it's Eurovision tonight. That's too bad. I'm sick of seeing you in those shoes, they're lame. Everything's lame here. You too, you were lame tonight. I'm really good at it. I warn you, we're on vacation. You promised… Be careful, my love. Anyone here? Ah yes, someone's here. You wouldn't be called Bernard, would you? Rue Saignol, Angernaud. Sandra. THE BLACKBIRD Pedro? It's me, stop your bullshit. Yes, in Angernaud. I don't know anything, but weird things are happening here, get over here. Are you writing? Bar de la Loire, Vieux Port neighborhood. LITTLE JÉRÉMIE HAS DISAPPEARED Hello? Shit! Do I scare you? MANAGEMENT JUPILER -Not any more. -Nice evening, isn't it? Average. Do you want to? Best not tonight, it seems I'm lame. What's in your pocket? Nothing. Have you been there for a while? Why? Haven't you noticed anything? Not much, your t-shirt. What's this thing again? Help me. Help me, ball buster! What's he doing there? It's when my legs don't want to follow my head anymore. Oh, shit. Eaten by worms. Did you know that flies fuck whilst flying? No. Then they lay eggs in meat, and so the fly colony starts fucking whilst flying again and then they lay more eggs. They do that without thinking because they're slaves to their bodies. Like you and me, ball buster. You're right, flies are idiots. It's the boat. What's up with your boat? Shit, I love that boat, and it's called Mary. Isn't that a sign? Yes, you already told me. You're free, ball buster, free to go die elsewhere. They threw me out, I'm solid, motionless… I'll go anyway, I'll kill them. Yes, we'll see tomorrow. …the existence of gas chambers. …news on little Jérémie, who disappeared ten days ago… none for the moment. Investigators aren't ruling out kidnapping. Oh, shit! Fucking face. That's great. Yes, perfect. It's valid. Look, a pedestrian. This is rare in these times of misery. Is your ear better? Are you talking to me? -Are you going to the same place? -Where? -Where I took your girlfriend? -Ah, okay. Well done. Who was the dandy with the hair? I dunno. Zombies of the night like the others, it's what the region wants. The war in the past, bankruptcy in the future. Have you eaten elvers? What's that? A local delicacy, a type of eel. They come up the estuary and get caught in the nets. Why do they do that? We don't know, it's in their genes. A bit like you. It'll be difficult, but take a good memory of Angernaud. He's not in bed? I'm looking for Sandra, is she here? Sandra, it's a name. Are you deaf? Do you have to serve yourself here? No, he'll come back. -I'll smash it. -Stop! I want to know if Sandra is here. Sandra? Your friend Bernard owes me 6000 francs. I don't know where he is. I saw him yesterday in the port, and then nothing since. Wait for him, he might pass by. The longer I wait, the more expensive it gets. Do you have cash? Is that okay? I don't have any cash. For money, you need to see Patrick. Carry on, where is this Patrick? Listen, it's not Patrick or Bernard you need to be scared of. It's me. He's called Patrick Debard. Great. What? He lives in a detached house, 7 rue des Carmes. I'm coming. What happened with Bernard? Except the bullshit in the cemetery. We were at the port, that's all. Did you see something? No. Are the faggots for today or tomorrow? He's full of shit. I've seen you somewhere before. You're too young to do this bullshit. And too pretty not to. Are you coming? You're so annoying. What else did you find? Just a kid frozen in a submarine. And what are you doing here? I couldn't sleep. Do you take me for an idiot? Is your submarine story true? Is it connected to the cemetery? We'll have to see. Well, that's it. I'm leaving tomorrow to go get a tan. You'd be better to follow the story. Six out of ten. Getting better. You qualify for a resit. What for? Six out of ten isn't bad. You know, I'm not really feeling this town. …the town's Ecomuseum. The police… You're not saying anything, we're not ready to go back. And we'll go buy more shoes. You can die. -A wanted notice… -Nonsense. …a certain Patrick Debard. Sport, PSG defeated. Clearly, the season isn't starting as well as the previous one. -The team was looking for him! -And? Have you read it? Drug trafficking, grave desecration… -It was deserved. -Don't talk bullshit. Do you know what your kids are doing at the moment? -And little Jérémie? -Leave me alone. -Do you think he was kidnapped? -Shit! You do a lot of weird things for cash. And Jacques! Sylvain Guzoni, the government's Mr. Africa, found dead in his apartment. According to the police, it was a suicide. Yeah, suicide by hanging with slit veins and bullets in his back. Completely normal. What can I do to prove I'm not racist? Get divorced? Marry a negro? Sorry, a Black guy! With aids, if possible. Marie-Jeanne? -Son of a bitch. -Poor girl! -Well done. -She didn't steal it. Bastard. Yeah, okay. Take this. What do I do with it? They're better than your stupid ones. And they're homemade. How would a slap in the face feel? Don't talk to me like that. I called the shop, Vanessa ran off with the cash register. Taking your job home. Whilst we wait, you'll get the money out… I'll get Pedro and join you. I was sure of it, what did the old codger do? You promised, Gabriel. I never promised anything. Tonight you can fuck yourself. That'll be a surprise. FUCK BILLS LITTLE JÉRÉMIE HAS DISAPPEARED LAST SEEN IN THE PORT What the fuck is he doing? Strange shoes. Hi,amigo. Don't get annoyed, is your captain here? What the hell is going on? Get the fuck out of here! It's fine. Yeah. Yeah! Hi, mate. That's little Jérémie. No, it's not him. Don't move. -Let me go! -The bitch wants it. Let me go! Shut your mouth. -Help! -Put it on, whore! So? Looks like your friend likes blood. Yeah, you like that. Yes, she does, the timing's right, because so do we. You can't stay there. There are loads of places better than this, okay? Leave her. -I hope you got the message. -Bastards. Pigs. Shit! Have a nice vacation! Police are still searching for Patrick Debard, and this morning, Angernaud market saw a single downpour. Indeed Stéphane, it's not usual, but the victim saw red. What's on that ship? What keeps bringing me to that one? Have you heard of Ben Wa balls? They're the size of eggs and inside is a marble. As soon as your wife puts it inside her, it'll make her come. Bullshit! No. -Can you put it in your ass? -If you want. -Where can you get them? -At the market. How's it going? Why do you say that? First lesson, how to tell a Gros Plant from a Muscadet. Hi, Daniel, how are you? Second lesson, how to tell a Muscadet from a Gros Plant. -What do you want? -Something decayed. I'll decay you. Conclusion? There's no conclusion. What happened to you? I fell off the side car. How fast were you going? -I was at the stop sign. -You're a real idiot. Were you traveling with that in the side car? Yeah, why? What are we gonna do with it? The same as usual. Is it dirty? In any case, it stinks. -What does he have, your boat? -I wonder the same thing. Anyway, he's the captain. Follow him and try to get him to talk. Between Spaniards, it'll be easy. -Did you read the newspaper? -No. You'll laugh, the cops have identified the guy from the church. I'm going, you know where to find me. Fucking shoelaces! I prefer you in espadrilles. And I prefer girls. That's nice. Angernaud is a dead end. When the bridges go up, we're isolated. Nothing can get through. Do you know Bernard Le Guillou? I'd recognize him, why? No reason. The young people around here are bored stiff. At their age, they quickly fall into the trap. Especially electoral ones. Have you ever sucked off a soldier? No, not that I'm aware of. Well, you know nothing about love then. Well you look like a really busy guy. Yeah, busy with taking taxis. What's that ship? The Mary? It's not a ship, it's an insult to the tax office. Russian crew, Spanish captain and Albanian owner. -What's the cargo? -Good deeds. He sends his used material to Lomé for free. It's his way of forgetting how he earned his cash. -Who's this "he"? -Nicolas Lesprit, Lesprit Public Work. True to the estuary climate. Nice bastard. Okay. MAN IN LEATHER MASK FINALLY IDENTIFIED HENRI FABIAN, EX-STAR… Thanks. Does Lesprit have links with Ms. Desanges? Why? I'm visiting a town, I like knowing. I love being taken for a fool. There you go. The Forcy jail, 50 km from Angernaud, has to be reinstated. Who's Sandra? The daughter of a man. Take your hand off now. Stop, I'm scared. Gabriel, this is Nicolas Lesprit. Nice to meet you. Does news travel fast or were you following her? Not bad. At 15, we were all crazy about him. Oh yeah? You wouldn't think so. Are you jealous? The group is back together, you'll have to get used to it. Is your daughter well? You know Sandra? I see you've met Fabien. Yeah, he's a really funny guy. It depends. It depends on the tide. Yeah? Yeah? No, I'm eating. Okay, we'll speak in the morning. Goodnight. A song, a play… No, we can't leave these poor people with a fully-stocked grocery store. Otherwise, they'll end up eating the staff. -Really? -Yeah. It's a question of common sense. Of course. Okay, are you done? I'm waiting for the school supplies for the Burkina children. It'll be on board in two days, the Mary will set sail after. -You should go into politics. -Is that a compliment? That depends. It depends on the uniform. I'm going to bed. Yeah. We've eaten well, let's try to sleep well too. Nonsense. Your friend's very classy. He's aged badly, that's all. And will his daughter age one day? I don't see the link. There might be one. You can't stop pissing everyone off. No. Are you gonna steal that shit? I dunno. Do you think this is cute? -Give it. -Put it in your bag. Wait, actually, I prefer this. Tell me, what did you find? No, you piss me off too much. The espadrilles were already enough. Are they not comfortable? Go on, load up! Something awful happened to me on the beach. I was thinking, 6000 francs for the cemetery, and 2000 for your intern, this weekend is starting to get expensive. Something disgusting. I don't print money at night, you know. Wasn't I supposed to lose all hope? How shall we do it? With no hands. Wow. Hello? It's Pedro. Did I wake you? Get over here, I found something at the port. Shit! Gabriel? Can you hear me? -Where are you going? -Go to sleep. That's right, forget about me. How did he get up? He must've had help. Does he have a link to the submarine? I dunno, this is the second one in two days. What do you want? Can I come in? What for? This isn't a vacation, it's a nightmare. I've never seen anyone hanged wearing gloves. If I leave, I won't come back. That's not my problem. You can't stay, your dad will be worried. Where's your boyfriend? I don't know. Can you help me please? I'm telling you he's an asshole! I pay him in brandy and he toasts to Franco! I didn't ask about his politics, but what he has in the hold. Shit! What does a garbage can carry? You're going back. Never. I'd need a ten-mile long straw to drink with him. A ten-mile long straw. You're an idiot. Ten miles! Another poor kid fallen into the trap? Patrick Debard wasn't a poor kid. What was he then? A small businessman. A bit of a dealer. First, I'm not your mother. Mothers aren't my department either. I never had one. I always wanted a mother like you. I wouldn't have minded. Don't leave her alone, go find Chéryl and stay with her. -Will she agree? -Get off. See you tomorrow on the banks of the Loire. Hey, little guy. No, nothing. You think I'm a little kid. I think you're you. A rich kid who likes scaring people. And what are you? A bourgeois woman who enjoys being vulgar? I'm tired. I like you, but you need to go home. Young anguish isn't my department. Poor guy! What the fuck are you doing? Are you jerking off? I'm warning you… I'm not gonna get my 6000 francs back here. Patrick, it's Sandra. A guy is following me, I don't know what he wants. -Warn Antoine and call me back. -Who's Antoine? This investigation is pissing me off. What's up with you? Well, well. In any case, I'll go to the concert on Saturday. Shit! Fucking espadrilles! You don't care, you're old, you've got nothing else to lose. I make one mistake and my whole life falls apart. What life? Excuse me, it's mine and I want it to be mine. I'm going to set sail, you know. I'm starting to get sick of your stories. You better not damage me, Gabriel, you fucking matador. There's no risk, you know me. Right. Remember me? What's your name? Bullet in the ass. Yeah, not bad. Kiss me, I'll know if you're lying. Shit, Chéryl. Chop chop. I'm not convinced. You need to stop the Muscadet. He's starting to scare the hell out of me. Holy cow! You must have really pissed them off. One question too many perhaps. It's Muscadet time, ball buster. Come on, drink with me. You need to drink on an empty stomach to not get drunk. Your father has enough problems with that. So now, you don't leave here again. You're a pain in the ass, Gabriel. Yeah, okay. Come on, let's get out. It's getting to be a lot of bullshit. Where did you pick him up? I found him on the jetty. He was sleeping like a baby, ass in the air. I was going to Lomé when the canoe sank. Carry on with your circus. One day, you'll have to explain what you're doing. What did they hit you with, a beet? We can't be as drunk as you are, it's hiding something. With the amount you drink, you'd be dead by 20. I'll drink milk when cows eat grapes. Is it the boat? What's up with the fucking boat? Camels. Camels for the woman I love. What's this mess? I'd like to know as well. Because I knew Muscadet before I came. One evening there were four kids in the port, the next day only two. I didn't tell you about the beach. Another time. Do you understand any of this? I'm here to understand. I'm happy that you're here. If you were 30 years older, I wouldn't say no. If it weren't for Chéryl, I'd throw you out. Your daughter isn't well. -I'm her father. -Doesn't seem that way. You don't have any children. Why, are you selling yours? It's not surprising people are beating you up. Are we done? Chéryl told me about her grandparents' grave. -You'll get a check. -Great. Isn't that what you wanted? And will there be a check for the dead people of Angernaud? I don't like your tone, Lecouvreur. I'm sick of your daughter pillaging the graves. -So what? -I want to talk to her. -She's not here. -Why are you hiding her? They saw something in the port, to do with the boat. Okay, listen. I don't understand your role, but the boat is my problem. Get out. If you have kids, don't give them to me. -Do you think she's still there? -Hopefully. Something disgusting happened to me on the beach, it was horrific. If not, she's in the shit. Tell me if I'm being a pain. On the beach, they told me to clear off. There's only one way of knowing if Sandra's there. -I understand. -Tell her we're mad. -How far can I go? -Up to there. Is that all? Anyway, I don't give a damn. Going to the cellar is getting into the shit. I don't like it when you're vulgar. I'm sick of this, let's go. No way. Those kids saw something. It smells like money, there must be cash on board. That changes everything, I thought so too. -Little Jérémie… -Yeah, you didn't follow anything. -Well, that's it, she's leaving tomorrow. -Who? -The Mary. -Oh really? Yeah. It's not too soon. I'm sick of his face. Me too. Don't leave him. Move. Where can we find the corvette guy? -Did he do that? -The guy who did that is dead. Since Bernard disappeared, he hasn't been seen. -And the guy with bleached hair? -Antoine? Yeah. I don't know anything. Shit! He might be at his brother's. The tranny. -Where is he? Tell me or I'll hit you. -You're so conceited. Go ahead, carry on. It's not the right day. Stop! The sun is here We can sort something out for the money. You'll have to sort yourself out if you carry on. Your friends are dead because they saw something. You were with them, so was Antoine. Leave me alone. Can't you see I'm sick? Really? Yeah. A bird is here Bathing, the sun on the… Don't be mad, but I prefer your girlfriend. So fragile, so delicate What she saw… He was all worked up because of the money. What money? Stealing bones for the madmen in Nantes. With the money, we bought everything he had. -From who? -The Weasel. Afterwards, we got high at the port. At one point, the trucks arrived. Army things in front of the boat. Help me, please. Carry on. Radio Angernaud, flash news. The suicide of Sylvain Gusoni, the government's Mr. Africa. The theory of murder appears confirmed. The statements given highlight worrying coincidences. I know Antoine, he'll be at the concert. A meeting at a concert, well done. After we've gone, you won't hear of us any more. What about your father? -What are they doing there? -Where? -At the Weasel's house. -Where does he live? There. Of course, I'm an idiot. Wait for me here, I'll be right back. Did that hurt? Who do you work for, you bastard? Ah, I see. Well done. CLEAN FRANCE -What the hell are you doing? -Opening the door. You're still sleeping it off! Where's the other drunkard? He was here not too long ago. You're such an idiot. Do you have castanets for brains? It's because of the Muscadet. I really have to stop. Yeah, you should retire. -What's that? -It's Sandra. She mustn't leave here, you're protecting her, understand? Even so! We'll go where you want, when you want And we'll still love each other… Hey. No, it doesn't hurt, it's in your head. Go into the cellar, into the muck. All of life will be like this morning In the colors of an Indian summer -She's cleared off. -Who? Sandra's disappeared. You need to follow the story. You need to explain this. LOIRE BAR Thomas? Oh, the writer? I haven't seen him. Why, has he done something? I warned you, if you fuck chickens, you end up with broken eggs. Nonsense. Stop. Have you seen Thomas the writer? No, and where's my brother? We're taking care of him. I saw the drunk. He was hanging around the docks near the boat. -Are we stopping? -Carry on. -Where are we going? -To listen to DJ Siam. -Who? -At the concert. Look around, I'm looking for the guy with bleached hair. Where? -Is Antoine here? -I don't know anything. People come and go all the time. -He left with some guys. -What guys? I don't fucking know, some guys. In a beat-up Mercedes. Get out of my car. Screw you! I'm going to smash your face in, fucking midget. What's with you? Do you have a problem? Clear off! Let me go, you fucker. Oh shit! -What are we looking for? -A Mercedes. Take the coast road. ENTRY TO SITE FORBIDDEN TO PUBLIC Stop! Stop, goddammit! That's it. He's not inside. Hurry! Yeah, let's go. I can't smell the barge. Yeah, it stinks. I'm sick of arriving too late! -What is it? -A coat button. Another stupid clue. It's not a clue, it's evidence. -What do we do? -We go. To the boat, you idiot. Follow the story! Shall I come? No, break the bridge and get Chéryl. -You're funny. -Hurry up, the boat can't leave. -What do I do? -Burn your shit. Piss off, that's my bike. Oh, shit! Come on, asshole, let's go where it's happening. -That's it, you're dead now. -Shut up. What the fuck are you doing? Who do you work for, the English guy? You'll end up talking! Is someone there? Let him go. Put it down. Goodbye, friend. You don't even have the balls. Right, Pierre? It's not possible. So, ball buster, are we on a trip? You'll see, Lomé is paradise. What's this boat, Thomas? Hell, ball buster. Hell. Put that down, you slut. We have better things to do. Naked! Every illness has its treatment. -Strip off. -What? Strip off. Strip off, like everyone. We pick them up in the villages. We smuggle them in. We make them work on the old work sites. The reactor core, for example. A total Lesprit work site. What reactor? The one that's been screwed up for months. This boat is full of guys with radiation poisoning that we send home incognito. How do you know all that? Not all organizations are dependent on the state. Which means? -What did he say? -He doesn't like liabilities. -Can you explain, ball buster? -Yeah. But it's mutually beneficial. Our friends in the government are sorry. We rushed things a bit. Bonus. The two downstairs. Tomorrow in the sea. Bon voyage. Do you know a shampooer on rue Popincourt? -I don't know. -Bitch. They're all there, behind the door. That won't work, it's welded shut. Go home, ball buster. This is my job now. Pedro's side car. What's that again? A twelve-gauge. Along with your Jaguar, that's what the English do better. I would change shoes. Shit, my new shoes! Where's Lesprit? I don't understand. You don't understand? For the Octopus' expenses. This is ridiculous, stop with that axe! I have the money. I have a lot of money, I tell you. You're lucky, it'll be quick for you. No wait, we can settle this. -It'll be useless. -What an idiot. You're wrong, ball-buster, you have to punish, -clean. -Do something, goddammit! You can see he's nuts. Don't fucking leave me. No! No! They found them. Excuse me, Ms. Desanges, do you know what's going on at the port? Damn, it's not getting any better here. -Where are you going? -Inside. Inside where? -Inside… Shit. Shit. Fucking hell. It's stopped working. We were going to have a big clean-up of the state. The minister had killed himself and guys like Thomas would clean it up. There'd be no more escapes, for the time being, no more stowaways sacrificed in a shitty power plant. Slow down, I don't feel well. There was nothing that linked Ms. Desanges to that, but I had my own idea. Are you okay, are you done? Nicolas Lesprit didn't need his Jaguar anymore. For Pedro, it was obviously worth losing his side car. That remains to be seen. The iguana is a devious and soulless being the life of this reptile is structured… Your counter-thing isn't rocket science, see what I mean. Your seminal fantasy. Semantics, Gérard. You're okay. When you booze on credit, don't piss off the owner. Hey, Gabriel, the thing you told me the other day, before your operation, how did it go? A lot of shining wits here. That's it. You'd be better off looking after your feet. Hey, guys. But what was that thing like… Oh, I knew it! Finally, we finish with some good news. Little Jérémie from Angernaud, who disappeared two weeks ago, has been found safe and well. With the help of the caretaker at an Ecomuseum, the child had been hidden in a submarine. When questioned by the police about why he did it, the young runaway was vague. -It seems… -I'd go to Le Jura. …that little Jérémie ran away after telling his dad that he wanted to work on a submarine. Yeah, submarine. -We are learning that little Jérémie… -Bullshit. …has made shocking statements about a murder committed in this submarine. The child is pointing the finger at a man hired by Marie-Jeanne Desanges, an important figure in Angernaud's political events. Isn't this the town you just came from? BODY OF A MASKED MAN FOUND IN THE CHANTEGRUE CHURCH, JURA What were you saying about a week of vacation? I'm in the background at the moment. I warn you, don't pull the same trick twice in a week. A chalet in the mountains… Both of us. You're right, it's rubbish. Subtitle translation by: Chloe Stout
