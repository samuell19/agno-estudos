Let's go, gino. Hurry! Prison control to phr and phq. Get away car with escaped prisoner headin' north to you. Repeat, phr and phq. And the kid? Don't see much of him. He's got new friends these days. Where does he hang out? Dear boy, you do have colorful acquaintances. They look like the supporting cast in a George raft picture. Hey, kid. Hey, gino. Hey. Hey, why didn't somebody tell me, eh? Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. Yeah. Hey, you're still big and ugly! You're taller than me. Yeah. You're still mad, gino? -Mad? -Yeah. Maybe, maybe, but I carried out tougher ones than this. Yeah, but I don't think you know what age you're livin' in now. So tell me what age we are living in. Computer intelligence, gino, like... I don't know. Like, moon flights and men walking in space, you know? I think that you must be walking in space. Yeah. Yeah, maybe, but I don't know gino. It's... it's the way you wanna do it. It's not gonna work. It's just not gonna work. You gonna teach me a better way, huh? Or maybe your friends have the right answers. All they do is play guitars and hide behind beards and smoke grass and wear flower pants. This new age really turned out some beauts. We should talk about it tomorrow. I wanna know now. Either he's in or he's out. Now come on, wait a minute, gino. There's still plenty of time to enjoy the fresh air, maybe see a few old friends. I just don't think you're ready yet. Stop! I think the kid prefers paper flowers instead of paper money. You're not gonna listen, huh? You're mad and nothing I say is gonna change it. I'm not mad, Tony; Only disappointed. The door's open, kid. I hope so. Here they come. Unit 7, zebra 79, calling control. Unit 7, zebra 7 9. See you and read you, go ahead. Oakland branch, 4 containers, 100's, 150's, 120's, 110's.

Thank you, employee. Stand. Hit me. Again. I'll stand. Hit me once. Good. 20. Dealer pays 21. That's the name of the game, and pay me. And thank you from this player. -Thank you, ma'am. -I'll stand. It's good to quit while you're ahead, right? I'll play these. You're a lucky girl. Thank you. Goodnight. Goodbye. Every weekend, never gets hurt. Damn lucky broad. Sure is. Goodnight, Tony. Goodnight. Hi, darling. Hi. Hot. How did we do? Well, we could've done better but it was still early when you gave me the single to quit. Eh, that pit boss, I don't think he liked the way my hands were moving. I like the way yours hands move. Yeah, it's too bad it doesn't do the same thing for him. So, how'd we do? Well, um, we made $410 but I lost $35 on my way out at the slots. That's your $35. We split up $410. -Tony? -Yeah? Isn't there anything in life besides money? So what? Aren't you interested in anything else? Hey, she's the only one that says anything else. She means herself, right? Mm... hmm. And you are a little bit interested in herself, aren't you? A lot of things about you interest me, like right now. Tony, I've got a plane to catch. You know how I get when you start that. Ple... please, don't. Just one second, please. Just a moment, sir. This is unit 3, kangaroo 14 calling control. See you and read you. Las Vegas branch. 4 containers, all 100's. 4 containers, 100's, check. Hi, beautiful. Hi, Joe. Everything okay? Everything okay. Route for unit 3, kangaroo 14. Load away 15 to San Bernardino, then south along the freeway to Los Angeles. Harry, you're a congress man. You're supposed to represent the people. Well, I'm people. I'll do my best. You do that or the people will get impatient with ya. Well, did ya have a nice weekend? Like any other. Did you win? A little. But bored a lot, huh? Is there anything else? Ann, I've been so damn busy. Well, that's what business men are supposed to be; Busy. You always had good taste. Wear 'em for me tonight. What time? I've got that business dinner tonight. Maybe we can have a drink together before that. Mr. Skorsky, please. -Yeah? -Your wife. The truck's heading for skorsky headquarters. They're following their routine trip. Nothing usual. They made the bank delivery. Everything's on the level. They're always one step ahead of treasury department, eh inspector Douglas? Any further instructions, inspector? You can knock off now. We'll try again on another trip, and thanks. Ann! Temper, temper. What's the matter, big daddy won't come up and tuck you in tonight? What are you doing here? Thought you might be lonely. Mm... hmm, and what if he had come up? I knew he wouldn't. He's got a big business dinner tonight with his wife. You'll get ran through trouble, Tony. Our kind of trouble's nice trouble. You're mad. It's been tried before. Yeah, how 'bout some music? By experts, Tony. That's nice. Always grabs me, that. Nobody can get into a skorsky truck. There's a guard locked inside and the doors open from inside, and he's the only one who can open them. The drivers don't even know the route. They get radio instructions once they're on the road. Well, I got into his... His what? Hm, his robe. Well you'll find his trucks a lot tougher to get into, Tony. Honey, there's nothing tougher to get into than another man's robe, especially the one he doesn't keep at home, but it can be done. It's just a question of information, like where's the key to his wardrobe and when is the next Vegas pickup cross the desert to la? See, it's all so simple. Information. Really gets to you, that. Tell me something, how long were you at the casino before you approached me. Two weeks, three? What do you want me to tell you, Ann? I'll tell you, Tony, you know exactly what you were doing with me from the very beginning. You watched every move I made; Took the job as a dealer because you knew I gambled there. You also knew I was skorsky's secretary. That's the only interest you ever had in me. You don't think very much of yourself as a woman, do you? And you think too much of yourself as a man. Look at yourself, you don't even fill that robe. Now get out of it and go! Any time you wanna draw another card, you know I can hit ya. Unit rabbit reporting, 12:15. We start loading plane on schedule. I think this time we might've found 'em with the wrong goodies in their pockets. Your attention, please. Departure of flight 059... I still think we should have asked clearance -from Washington. -No time. Anything goes wrong skorsky can scream a legal search. Treasury isn't searching, it's airport police. Don't worry, I've covered for treasury department before. Due to technical requirements, flight 059 to Mexico City will be delayed for 5 hours. Will all passengers please... Just a second! Unload all that baggage and get it out of here, fast. What's happening, inspector? Bomb warning. Go ahead, get aboard and scrub every inch, will you? You in charge for skorsky? Yes. -Open them. -Open? But these are bonded bank deliveries. Doesn't matter, open them or you don't load. Mr. Skorsky, they wanna talk to you. Go ahead. Bomb alert for light 059 to Mexico. Port authority's searching all cargo. -Including us? -Yes, sir. Don't they know what a bonded bank delivery is? They insist, otherwise we can't load. Let me speak to the inspector. No, no, never mind. Okay the search, but I want the inspector to sign our manifest and an acknowledgment that he searched our cargo. Right, sir. Get me Mr. King in acapulco. Ann. I've got a... Gotta get away for a little while. Let's go to acapulco. A long weekend; Forget everything else. What do you say? Acapulco on the line. Yes? Clean. Bad timing. The search, it might alert skorsky. He may call a halt to operations. Yeah, I may have blown a year's treasury investigation. That's what I meant. First clear it with Washington. Yeah, you know it's funny, for the last 6 months every time we smelled an action in progress, skorsky had either halverston, nickles, or young on duty. Maybe skorsky makes his moves then. Only when he as those three teamed as the crew. Yeah, that's... that's a possibility. Boy, if we could only manage to get a copy of his future guard duty assignments. Hey, let's get in touch with, uh, with higgen's aster insurance. It's time I met skorsky personally, then we'll do it through his insurance company. Come on, tell 'em I wanna get outta here. You win. Hey, she has 21. Maybe wants the dealer to get rich. Unit 19, camel 57 riding from Las Vegas to highway 15, south of windhill station to amboy, across 5 palms through to highway 10. Good. Well, how soon can you get the date? Two days before pickups skorsky will give me the coded information to feed into the computer. On the morning of pickup, the route will be punched out automatically on a tape like... just like that for the control clerk. That gives me two days to get ready. Okay, now I'm gonna take sick leave at the casino, check in at the hotel bonne in Los Angeles. When you get the date, telephone, but make sure you call from an outside phone or something, you know? If I'm not in you leave a message. Party arranged for such and such and a date, you know? And after all is over how am I going to go to you? I mean, it looks suspicious and... You won't, you wait a month, five weeks, and then you tell skorsky he either divorces her or let you go, simple. Suppose he agrees? He won't. -What if he does? -He can't. He needs his old lady's connections. Well, suppose he finally decides he needs me more, or do you think that's impossible? You stop trying to back me into a corner, will you? I just want you to tell me something, Tony. Do you think it's impossible for a man to want me more than anything else? To give up everything for me? Just what the hell do you want me to answer, huh? Would you give up everything for me, Tony? You wanna call it off? Yes, and if I do I'm finished, right? 'Cause I'm a loser no matter what. I never pushed you. Oh, I know, darling. Believe me. It's of no use. Sleepless nights whatever I do. Hey now, listen. Together we're gonna make it work, huh? It's gonna work. No use in borrowing trouble. Hm, I'm not borrowing it. I'm earning it. Hm. Like an old family reunion, huh? Our leader picks up the hotline and here we are. Well, time for kicks, men. So, ladies, here we have the fortress. Impregnable and bulletproof all over, including windshield and windows. Only weak point, front tires, and Baxter's old elephant gun will take care of it I'm sure. Now here's the desert road running south on the highway, passing through 5 palms and amboy, hooking up at the other end with highway 10. Now, that the route unit 19, camel 57 will take on a Las Vegas, Los Angeles run. When, dear boy? We wait for word in a day. And who gives you the word? When I get it you'll get it from me. That's all you have to know. This is one of the runs I made across the desert. It runs from highway 15 here, then continues south where it ends at highway 10, that's here. The skorsky truck is routed to go to highway 10 then west to la, but it never gets to highway 10. We'll make the hit here; 5 palms. Okay, look. Uh, here we have a roadmap of the area. Now, the minute we hit the alarm goes. From that second it'll take the police at least one hour to reach us. -That's here. -Tony, I don't get it. All the police have to do is roadblock both ends and we've had it. -That's right. -And you figure to open that mother and be out of there in less than an hour? Dear boy, not in your wildest dreams. Sal figures four days if we have to cut. Four days? My three year old kid sister could do it faster. Will mother borsey be using his false teeth? And all this time what's the police supposed to be doing? Bringing in fresh supplies of false teeth for momma borsey. Tony, the police will be combing every square foot in the area. Yeah, what happens to us and the truck? White magic. My fairy godmother appears and makes us and the truck just vanish into thin air. Hm, that's right. We hit here. Still no date? Any day now. You know, this is the closest I've been to Vegas. Next, after this, we can buy it. Ann? This is the new James Bond of aster insurance. Uh, no offense mister, uh, Douglas? My friends tolerate my bad jokes. I feel we'll be friends. Mr. Douglas would like to see next month's route operations and guard assignments. I want him to see the complete schedule. He's the replacement for Mr. Riff, and since this is Mr. Douglas' first visit we'll do our best to be helpful. There you are. I'm sure, Mr. Douglas, you can see at a glance how the men are constantly shifted and juggled into different teams. I never permit any two men to work together often enough for them to make any ambitious plans for their own future. Very impressive, Mr. Skorsky. See, until they report none of the guards know who they're gonna be teamed with or what their routes or destinations will be. But except for the names of the guards, Mr. Skorsky, all of this is in code. And nobody knows the code, except me, and big brother himself. There. Oh yes, duty number 137. Halverston, nickles, and young. Looks like skorsky's gonna have at least one more shot at it. Might be our last chance to bust him. -Sam? -Yeah? I'm gonna go all out right down the line, and if I'm wrong again this time, I'll wind up working for some sleazy private eye framing divorce evidence. Hi. Hi. Told you. Dangerous to meet 'til this is over. I wanted to see you. Why? You could have phoned the date. I know. All right. The date? Tell me. I have a terrible feeling, Tony. I love you. Really, Tony, I love you. I know, come on, the date. Friday the 15th, 10 am. Tomorrow morning he wants me to go on a long weekend. Acapulco. Hm, good. You want me to go with him? It's a great break, you out of town. Since we've met it's hell for me. I just can't make it with him any longer, Tony. You've gotta hang on. How much longer? 'Til it's over. Normal, just... I don't know, go on acting normal. Don't try to contact me again unless there's a real emergency. This is the last time I see you, then? Yeah, for a while; 'Til I send you word. When this whole thing's over we'll have a ball together, hm? Mm... hmm. Behave yourself, little girl. Hey. Take care. You know I'm always happy to see you, Steve, but do you think it's wise to visit me here? It was necessary. Wisdom is never found in necessity. The treasury, they got their eye on me. Oh? They hit one of my trucks with a federal search warrant. I see, and they found nothing. Not yet but I'm hot. I've gotta quit. Quit? I've too much to lose. I've built up a solid, legitimate business. I'm shooting for a government coast-to-coast franchise. Figured I better leave the table before I get hurt. Leave the table after eating so well at it? That type of disloyal talk, Steve, it makes me very unhappy. You'll get over your sorrow in time. Steve, you know our business. A man doesn't just quit. He dies, but he never quits. Do you want another drink? Beno, give Mr. Skorsky another drink, please. Tomorrow I'll make the Vegas run. It'll be the last time, and if you wanna take me on you know where to find me. Hi. How you doin'? Put your hands on your heads, Mr. Halverston and Mr. Nickles. Mr. Young must be in the truck, huh? All we want from you is the time of the drop and the extra cargo that you're carrying. Mr. Skorsky's undeclared private shipment. No? -Hold up? -Call it that. Treasury department. Oh yes, you're... Right, la airport. Okay, no arguments. Now hear this, proceed as usual, normal contact with the control. You do or say nothing that'll alert them. My partners will be riding up front in place of halverston and nickles. As usual, you give them the route you get from control. When your reach the drop for your super cargo you get out, unload, just as if nothing at all was happening. Come on. Man, I dig deep. Good boy. Hey! Make sure the contact between the truck and skorsky's office remains normal. I don't want anybody on that end becoming suspicious, get me? Now go! Go. The drop? 1:15. Lake mccarran. That's right here. Now Brian and I, we head for the drop right now. We take a different route to make sure we go unnoticed. We meet ya there, is that clear? Yes, sir. I don't wanna speak out of turn but wouldn't it have been better to confiscate the truck and the illegal cargo before they take it out of the country? I'm after the big boys. At the meeting point we should be able to find out where the shipments going. I need a hot proof between, uh, skorsky and the organization. Come on, Sammy. Leave the wrinkles to me, huh? Hm? 44 left. Well, that bird ready? Huh. Do good, man yeah. Decoy calling Blackjack. The truck's arrived. Proceed to the border. Wanna say goodbye to your lady friend? Yeah. Hey, Max? Send me a wild postcard. Over. Yes, good luck. Sorry you can't come with me. Over. Buenos fuertes. Over and out. It's getting pretty close to 0. Let's knock on it. Bye-bye. Hey, lover, how'd you like to get him for the playmate of the month, huh? Time, 11:15. 11:15 position report. There. That must be the carrier pigeon. As soon as it loads and takes off contact headquarters. Have 'em send up a couple of police planes to force it down before it crosses the border. And we'll call back when unit reaches ne... Control to 19 camel, come in. Control calling 19 camel. Unit 19, camel 57 calling control. What's happened? I don't know. We've lost contract with control. 19 camel 57, from shortwave to control. Over. Can only read you on shortwave. Lost video contact, over. Camel video also inop. Must be the relay tower. The damage doesn't seem to come from this end. We'll check with you ever 5 minutes. Over. Wilco and out. Put me through to the cabin. Okay. Lloyd? Yes. We've lost TV contact with control. May be just a technical foul up but stay alert. Could be a cute trick from my friend here. I swear I haven't done anything. I hope so for you. I'm looking at sand drifts. Seems like someone put it there for us. What does this mean? I don't know anymore than you do. Cabin. Proceed with caution across drift. No matter what happens, don't get off the road. We'd be stuck for good in the sand. Rifle fire, somebody in front of us. We're hit, your mob. I told you I have nothing to do with this. They must be hiding behind those dunes but I'll get them to come out. Unit 19 camel 57 calling control. We're hit, truck bogged in sand 4 miles south of highway 15 on 5 palms road. Heavy force. Attackers with flame throwers and automatic... Skorsky security to phq Las Vegas to sheriff station. Amboy 5 palm. Unit 19 camel 57 hit. Armored truck held up on 5 palms road 14 miles south of highway 14. Unit 19 camel 57. 5 palms road and highway 15. Detain and question. Report back to phq. Once you get to the scene... Mr. Skorsky, acapulco, urgent. Mr. Skorsky in acapulco, please. Calling unit 19, camel 57. Come in, camel. No contact. They must have hit the antennas. Lloyd? Carl? If you need something just ring. Lloyd, Carl, you hear me? Okay, guys, hold it. Let's move, huh? Hey, sal? Here's the spot. Be patient, huh? I think it's all there, and with one little blast the whole scene could be in our lap. Hey, Tony! We could do it now before the fuzz gets here. Yeah and let everybody know where we are for miles around. That's very bright. This cat inside will open up when we want him to. He doesn't, we'll get in my way. Hey. My god, volcano. Me, I have to breathe this? Hey. Are you still there? Lloyd, Carl? If you hear me and your mic is dead rap on the cab with... Be a nice kid, Tony. Give our boy a rap on the cab. He's getting lonely. Vulture to troya. You're covered. Out. Roger, out. Vulture to troya, come in. Troya reads vulture, over. There's a car approaching. -Over. -The law? -Over. -Don't think so. Red sports convertible. Driver only. He's looking up here, possibly even watching me cleaning up the tracks in the sand. He doesn't look suspicious but I don't know how much he's seen-over. All right, chopper, I'll take care of the rest. Over now. Max, open the hatch. Tony, you need a friend? Easier alone, baby. Tony. Sal, I can't let him report seeing a helicopter in the area. Listen! Hands on the wheel! Open up. Step out nice and easy. Put your hands on your head. Hey, just what... Over the hood. Okay now, give me a drivers license and the registration. Yeah, I, uh... I've got my license, car's a rental. I've got a copy of the rental contract. I can give you that, huh? Should've been here an hour ago. Yeah, and we can't even backtrack the route. Sheriff klinger, inspector. No, nothing. No development. Yes, I know how skorsky can get. We're doing everything we can; Establishing roadblocks over an area of 50 square miles. Checking every car and truck, tanker, trailer, anything that moves or even crawls. No, not yet, we're still waiting to hear from sa... Oh, I see. Just a minute. There's a report, yes, inspector, it just came in, uh, from captain trumble. Detail 1964 red corvette convertible. Plates a 4 1 0 5 8 4, delivered sm branch, registered 12th of this month to James mcgray who stated he'd drive to las Vegas and turn in vehicle there. Yes, it checks out okay. It doesn't seem important right now but I'll keep your office briefed, inspector. Sorry, Mr. Ferris. Just one of those things we have to do. Thanks. It's all right, sheriff. Search every garage on the highway. This the first time one of your trucks disappeared, Mr. Skorsky? Could it be your usual safety device has been overlooked? Mr. Skorsky, will you tell us if... No comment. Do you think this will affect your application -in Washington? -No. That application is based on the impregnability of the skorsky armored trucks. They are and that truck will be found intact. Let's get going. So far, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Skorsky has refused to give a report other than to state the confidence that the truck is intact and the money is safe. We return now to our studios where we'll have further reports in several hours. So far Mr. Skorsky is clairvoyant. Mother borsey and her damn smoke. She gets her jollies by inhaling it. The lock, she's moving! Hey, watch it! No use wasting up all your energy now. We might use it later. Now don't tell me yuma. That truck was hit here. Not barstow, not Paris, France. Here! Mr. Skorsky. State troopers, highway patrol and deputies around the clock, no food, no sleep, scrubbed every square mile. Well scrub it again. I haven't slept since I left acapulco. That truck's gotta be somewhere in this area. Mr. Skorsky! What is it? Uh, I'd like to run the unit camel tapes from, uh, Vegas departure to the last signal. But the police have been chewin' on 'em all night! Yeah, well I'd like to run 'em for myself. Go ahead! Let's go. How will you make it? I can't now. I'll wait until it gets dark. Anyway, they should be getting some news from Mexico pretty soon. Might take 'em off our backs. Ciao. Calling control, we're hit, heavy force. Attackers with flame throwers and automatic rifle fire. Probably attack from behind dunes. Calling control, we're hit, heavy force. Attackers with flame throwers and automatic rifle fire. Probably attacking from behind dunes. Acapulco calling, Mr. Skorsky. Yeah? Gone, that's all. We were hit! Miss Bennett? May I ask you a few questions? -Certainly. -Mr. Skorsky told me, you remember, that only he and big brother, uh, know the routes his trucks will take. That's correct. Yes, but when he's not here who gives them to control? Well, you see, the computer is time locked and automatically delivers the routes to the control clerk on the morning of the pickup. Very hygienic. Untouched by human hands. Where were you and Mr. Skorsky when the holdup took place? In acapulco. Oh, I see. Thank you. Enjoy the broadcast? An expensive one for, uh, aster insurance. 7 and a half million. Isn't currency alone, I was also thinking of the lives of, uh, your men. They're insured too. Then all you stand to lose is a reputation. That means more to me than the 7 and a half million. You mean you'd rather lose the, uh, the money instead? In spades. Well, that truck'll be found. It had to be cracked from outside by, uh, someone who knew exactly where to wait for it. Nobody could know that. Not even the crew. Not until they got their route instruction from control while they were rolling. That truck was tailed to 5 palms road and then hit. They might've broken into the drivers compartment but they'll never get inside the bottom. Uh, you were out of town when this broke, weren't you? Would you mind telling me where you were? What's that got to do with it? Well, is there, uh, any reason why you shouldn't tell me? No, but I won't. Why not, Mr. Skorsky? Because where I go and what I do is my own damn business. Mr. Skorsky, your truck last night was taken across the Mexican border. Reports from the Mexican federal police. Truck was camouflaged with red paint but otherwise answers description. The relay towers is blown, picture goes, and all we know is what the crew tells control. I knew it. Those trucks can't be taken from the outside! It was my own crew! And it's the bonding company that'll have to pay, not aster. You have no loss, no responsibility, and no further authority. Goodbye, Mr. Douglas. Yes, Mr. Skorsky. I'll, uh, I'll tell my company about this. And since this afternoon we have received further reports from Mexico, which will lead us to expect a break in the case soon. What were those reports, inspector? Sorry, I can't divulge information now which might hamper the work of the investigators. Uh, sir, do you accept the Mexican theory? It's not a theory, it's a fact. No one can break a skorsky truck without the connivance of an inside man. No mob would have the time to cut or burn their way into the truck before the police found it. Each man inside has his own air unit, water, food supply, can last for 72 hours. That does it. -Let's move. -What do you wanna do? What we should of done at the beginning, blast! -But Tony decided we... -To hell with Tony! For all we know he's been wasted. It pains me to admit it but Cooper may be right. You heard skorsky. That cat inside might hold out for a long time. But now we have the time. -We can wait. -Shut up! Listen, Coop, the police are looking for the truck and crew in Mexico. The search in the desert is off. That's the point, bax. Now we can blast without anyone knowing about it and I know just where to get the stuff to do it. I'll be back in an hour. Nobody leaves the trench. We're still following Tony's orders. Aren't you just a little too old to be playing teacher's pet, grandpa? Listen, queen firefly. You just play with your Roman candle and be quiet or we might blast you. Just cool it, huh? You should be more careful. I could hear your voices upstairs, especially you, Cooper. And no blast. -Why not? -Because I say so. But Tony, the cops think the crew did the job. They're looking for them in Mexico. The search upstairs is out. Yeah, I know, but we'll burn and that's it. We'll never burn our way into that. I'm starting to lose my girlish laughter, Tony, playin' mole down here when we could be done in 15 minutes. It's too dangerous to blast, Leroy. I'll have a word with 'em. Hey you in there, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. We wanna talk with ya. I'm listening. We're gonna give you a chance to walk away in your own power. All you have to do is open the doors nice and easy like, and come out with your hands on your head. We'll let you go. Where are Lloyd and Carl? They're right here. Let me speak to them. You can talk to them when you come outside, but first open the door. Not until you let me speak to them. Just come out of there! Give me that mic, now just come... What does he mean no chance? Break 'em, we blast if you don't... Cooper! All right, now let's just everybody knock it off. Come on. We've had a few problems but things are still cool. If we just keep our heads we can make it, and we're not gonna blast. You put that on, Cooper. There's only one. Can you hear me? Say something! Stop, I'll... You'll open up! Yes, yes. Make sure your hands are on your head. Yes, I'll... but stop! He's comin' out. Only chance. I'll lay back with the chopper. You go out with your hands up. When they come in they don't know I'm here. Maybe there's a chance to cut them down. Give me the mask. Go! Hands on your head. Move! Get your... Automatic trip. Well that's a round for mother skorsky. Maybe two. I don't know why we're comin' out here. I'd like to see the place where you say it was hit. Hit? You saw the police reports. I saw them. My own crew, the bastards. Roll in to Mexico. That's how you figure? You got another theory? You said you wanna leave the table, no? Maybe you'll decide to take another bite before you go. A 5 million dollar bite. What's that going on down there? Douglas! Yeah? What the hell are you doing here? Oh, you know, Sunday afternoon suntan. We can't all afford weekends in, uh, acapulco. Who is this gentleman? Insurance. Maybe he can use a little insurance for his family. Skorsky. Recognize him? Kozanostra, the, uh, uncle from Mexico. Yeah, and the nephew. Best chip man in the family. Young told skorsky control that truck was stopped by a sand drift on the 5 palms road. Well, I can see a lot of sand but none on the... None on the 5 palms road. Skorsky may be everything that we think he is but he didn't pull this heist. This is an inside job. Somebody in his organization managed to get the route of the truck and the time, that's why he's here. He's as much in the dark as we are. And I can't hold his men much longer. I gotta get some answers. Answers, from who? The only one who must tell the truth. Big brother himself. Vulture calling troya. Come in, troya. Troya reads vulture. Over. Glad you got back home okay. Decoy is back. He's with me now. Any trouble in your sector? Over. Yeah. Bax got a couple in the head. Pigeon inside the cage is wasted. We'll have to do it the hard way now. Over. Is the mummy there? Hi, Max. Hi, Coop. Did you bring me back your sister like you said you would? What's the matter, lonely down there? Right, man. I've had it down here. Bring me two six packs of dynamite. Over and out. When you gonna straighten that head up, Cooper? I don't see where things are working so good your way. What are we gonna do, spend a winter in this hole? Hey, grandpa, give us a break and turn it off. I said turn it off! Hey! International business machine. Hey! Trove, I wanna speak to Mr. Skorsky. On this screen a microfilm record of all operations can be read. It's all filed and coded. Can you ask paski for the las Vegas pick up of last Friday? What's going on? Trying to get some answers out of big brother. Answers? Yes, the number of pickups you ran last week. The number of times routes were punched. You know how to operate this machine? Mr. Godlove here, he's the, uh, electronics and computer expert on my staff. Well the police have proved it was my own crew! Two of your crew, Mr. Skorsky. Halbertson and nickles. I've had 'em both on ice for the past 48 hours. Unit camel has been in control of my men. Special agents, treasury. Wilshire 9. 7 8 4 8 6 6. Get me judge Turner. You just bought yourself a lot of trouble, Mr. Douglas. Come on. The route and the date. Somebody in your tight security organization was able to coax the route; The route and the date out of big brother at least two days before the robbery. At least that much time the mob had to prepare for the attack. Maybe big brother can tell you who. Steve. Is there anything wrong? Hm? Frankly, yes. I've been doin' some homework with the computer. You know, I've been a fool. I don't understand. These are last week's bank pickups. 8 on Wednesday. 10 on Thursday. 9 on Friday. 8 on Wednesday, but there were 9 tapes punched. The 9th was the Vegas route. Who'd you give it to, Ann? I don't know what you mean. You're the only one who has access to the card. You punch 'em out, you can punch 'em beforehand. Oh, you made a mistake. Well, I understand, but you have to tell me who you gave it to. But Steve, I swear... I'm pressed for time. Very important people after me who want the answer, too. Steve, I never did. I couldn't. Ann. Now listen, it could have been anybody in the office. It could have been the control clerk... Come on, now, the truth, and if you lie to me... Hey, what's happened? Cooper split. What? Gone. -Then I guess it's all over. -Why? You and sal give me a hand. I don't need him anymore. Tony, all of a sudden I don't like it. Why? What we're after, it's all right here, man. The law nails him he'll spill everything he knows. I don't wanna be here when they come visiting. You'd better come too. Nope. Okay. We'll think of an easier way to make money next time. Leroy. It's not just the money that counts. Personal pledge I made to a good friend. If and when the police come they've gotta find this truck open. Prove to the world that it's possible to get inside a skorsky truck. An interesting concept, but your personal pledges were not in the program and I came for the money, and because I like being with you, but not in the state pen, you can keep my share. Hey, thanks a lot but you can hardly give away what you don't have. I need your help now. I can't do it with sal alone, you know that. Tony, I don't want to appear obstreperous but I'm leaving. Do what Tony says. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Shall we have some tea? Tony, over here! She's taking a long time to make up her mind, ain't she? She'll make her move. Maybe it's better if I have a friendly conversation with the little lady. No, she's afraid of talk now. Only chance is to let her leave. Hey, gino. We're here, baby. It's all here. It's all here. It's all here. Vulture calling troya. Come in, troya! Can't see what else we can do now. Keep talking in circles. The only thing which makes sense for us now is to get some rest. Yeah, well any minute now everything's gonna make sense. Just takes a little, uh, Patience. It's gonna happen right in here somewhere, and when it does I'm gonna need all your help.

I'm a friend of Tony's. What kind of friend? A friendly friend. Listen, can you tell me where Tony is? Yes. Well, I don't ask you to tell me where he is, but I have a very important message to give to him. Sure, what's your message? Yes? Tony. I've been trying to reach you.
