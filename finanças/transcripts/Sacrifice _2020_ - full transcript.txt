Hey are you okay? Is it sea sickness or morning sickness? Can it be both? From what I reckon it's the boat guy. I've got it covered. I got one for you too. Cheers. Cheers. This island is good things for a family, huh? Yeah I hope so, I mean it's beautiful. Holiday home. - Yeah. - Imagine. No. How you feeling nauseous-wise? I'm okay, let's just oh, fresh air will be good. Doesn't look like we have squatters. That's good. So what do you think? I think we'll be lucky if we don't spend the night in jail for breaking and entering. Okay. Oh ye of little faith. I would carry you across the threshold but Oh stop! Well, is it all flooding back,. I don't..uh... Kinda. Kinda, it's definitely smaller then I remember. Yeah, everything is bigger when you're a kid. Whoa. I remember this. I used to stare at this for hours as a kid. Well it's not the best day to take a photo, but... - You know. - He's fine with the rainbows. - Right? - Hmm. Book of Genesis? - God's reminder that he's watching over us. - Oh okay. I just sleep through Sunday school. Yes. Don't drink the water it's gross. Left it running to see if it clears. What's up? Hmm. Oh. It's my dad. I'd almost, forgotten what he looked like. Hi, do you speak English? That depends. Depends? On what? Do you speak Norwegian? Oh, I don't know. I'm sorry. So if I don't speak English and if you don't speak Norwegian then how would we communicate? So you do speak English? Of course I speak English everybody speaks English. We raped your women. You raped our linguistic Legacy. Actually, we're Americans. I don't think you guys made it that far. What? Is this man bothering you? His ignorance is bothering me. That's for sure. Are you one of those indoctrinated zombies that still believes that Christopher Columbus discovered America? That depends on what you mean by discovered many would argue that the Native Americans actually- - We... were smashing Cherokee feet. when Christopher Columbus is great great great grandfather was still sucking on his mother's tit. Guys, come on. There's a lady present. Well, uh, unless there was an Immaculate Conception uhm, pretty sure she knows what a good Harpoon is by now. That's not the point. Come on we can go somewhere else for dinner. Good luck with that. We're not going anywhere. We're hungry. They got to feed us. Where's your menu? We don't have a menu. Of course, you don't but this is a fishing village. So I assume you guys serve fish, right? Well, we don't serve chili dogs and pizza if that's what you're looking for. No fish'll do just fine Do you have any calamari? Calamari is not a fish. Fish is a vertebrae, calamari are is an invertebrate. A fish has a backbone, it's Seafood. - It's seafood, same thing. - Same thing? Yeah, it's Seafood. You guys serve food from the sea. - If you don't serve calamari the- - We definitely don't serve calamari. Well then for the love of God, what do you serve? That depends. Jesus Christ! Jesus won't help you here. Come on. Let's go. Yeah, do what your lady says. We're not going anywhere. I'm hungry - and you're gonna feed us. - I'll feed you to the sharks. Isaac I want two plates of fish, a large beer and a lime and soda for the lady, make it snappy. That's enough. It's time for you to go. I'm not going anywhere. It's time for you to go. No! Okay! Okay, just stop! Just get off him! You leave quietly and go back to where the hell you came from. He is back where he came from. - What do you mean? - He was born here. Gunnar: What's your name? Isaac. Your family name. What's your family name? Pickman! Pik-Man? Yeah very Norwegian. Most nights we can hardly move in here for all the pick men. Jorstad. That was his birth name, Jorstad. Johan Jorstad's son? Yeah. Jorstad. Isaac Jorstad, why didn't you say so? Oh my God, you're, you're bleeding. Ledvor, get the man a bandaid he's bleeding! Look, we're sorry, okay. We were just, just messing around. I mean, it's really not much else to do right here. Yeah sleepy town restless nights, you, you know how it is. What? Why don't you get the lady a chair? Could you see she's with child again? Sorry. What's your poison? Uh, Beer, please. Beer? Aquivat, the whole bottle. Tonight we celebrate. Welcome home. Okay. Okay get in. Okay. Uhm. Come on. Go upstairs now. Emma: No, lie back. Back, back, back. - Come here, come here. - No you're good. Hey, whoa, whoa. You're coming back right? Where did you get breakfast? Don't creep up on me, please. What? You are lucky you didn't induce labor. Where did you get breakfast? Just the local store. - Yup. - Because somebody, has been dreaming away up there for hours. What time is it? Yeah, it's way past your breakfast time. Technically breakfast time's whenever you break fast, so it is breakfast time. Wow, you sound like one of your new friends. What do you mean. Fish is a vertebrate, calamari is an invertebrate. Well actually squid is an invertebrate. Calamari is squid served as food. So it's like saying steak is mammal. See what I mean there. What am I doing? Great guys. Yeah, great might be overstating it a bit... interesting, I'll give you that. Well, you just wouldn't get that kind of welcome back home. No, you're right. My head though is killing me. Well, that's surprising. How did you sleep Like a baby. Oh, that's good. Unfortunately, whatever idiot coined that phrase clearly never spent any time around babies or they'd know how badly they sleep. Look who's being pedantic now. Hello. Mr. Isaac Pickman. I... yeah. Otherwise known as Isaac Jorstad. I guess. I am Lensmann Renate Nygard. Local sheriff. I would like to ask you some questions. I'm here, legally. This is my house. I own it. Yes you do. May I come in? Of course, sorry. Should I - go put some clothes on. - That won't be necessary. Take a seat, please. Would you also like to sit down. I'll stand, thank you. Look Sheriff if this is about what happened last night, uh, then I just want to say that that was an innocent misunderstanding, no harm was done and I... - certainly don't want to press charges. - What happened last night? Them, argument in the bar. This is the first I heard about it. That's not why I'm here. Okay, so why are you here? I assume it's not just a welcome us to the neighborhood. Unfortunately, no. So... what did you want to ask me? I wanted to ask you about your father? My father? Specifically the murder The murder I want you to tell me everything, you know about the murder. Every detail. My father murdered somebody? - What? - What? I want you to tell me everything you remember about the night your father was murdered. My father was murdered? Well, there has never been a trial. We are still very unclear about the events of that night Personally, however, I am satisfied that six separate blunt impact wounds to the back of the head at least two of those being postmortem, constitutes murder. Uh. What? Who? Who? Who murdered my dad? You don't know Do I look like I know? Well, this is uhm- Who the hell murdered my dad? You don't remember anything about the night your mother left with you? well my mom she woke me up and we, we left we got, we got on a boat and, and we just left - And she took you to America. - It was her home - And she never told you why she left - Of course she did. What did she say? She told me that he left us. He abandoned us and he... he found a new family. So she, took me back to her old family. And how is your mother? She's, uh, She's... She's dead. Oh. I'm sorry. That's why we're here. The house was in the will and we're I'm, I'm... Next of kin, so. I see. So... Who, murdered my dad? Mr. Jorstad, I came here today, because your father's murder has remained an open case for 25 years. And I was hoping that perhaps you might be able to help us. Finally bring matters to a close. Or, uhm, perhaps even convinced your mother to turn herself in. I, uh... I'm sorry. That's all right. Well, uhm, where did, where did she, uh, do it. Your uhm, your foot would be resting on his head. We tried our best with the cleanup but some stains you just, Can't wash away. Look, I. I can see that my assumptions were. Entirely misguided in this matter and I apologize that you had to find out like this. Believe me, I was just as shocked as you when I first heard. Your mother and father were much loved in this community. Why do you think she would do that? I don't know. She told you that he found a new family. Then families are complicated. Sometimes people get jealous, they feel betrayed and often they lash out. But family is also the most important thing in the world and in a way your mother and father were both part of mine. I feel terrible about this. I really do. This is not. Not a good welcome to our community. Let me try to make it up to you. Why don't you? The three of you, come to my house for supper tonight, and I can fill you in on some of the brighter aspects, of your family history. Hi. Hi. 65 Krone, please. Takk. Dream well. Thanks. Yeah... You too. Are you sure this is the right place? Well looks like it? If not, I need to hand in my Eagle Scouts badge. Well that's the creepiest thing I've ever seen. Creepier than my dad's corpse stain? Oh apologies. We have the wrong house. My husband's map reading skills are clearly not as good as he thinks they are. Nonsense. If there is one thing a Norwegian knows how to do it's to navigate. It's in our blood. Isn't that right Isaac? Speaking of blood, this is my daughter Astrid. Pleasure to meet you. It's a pleasure to meet you. We got this for you. But I hope it's okay. They didn't have much in the store. You shouldn't have. This will go wonderfully with the trout. Come in. This looks amazing. Thank you so much. Yeah if it tastes as good as it looks, then we are in for a treat. It's all Astrid. I don't know where she gets her domestic talent from certainly not her mother. I must say I feel terribly underdressed you both look so glamorous. I think Perhaps it is we who are overdressed. It's just that, we don't get much opportunity to entertain and... well, it's just so lovely to have company. Dive in, before I get cold. Mmm, mmm. That is divine. Wow. What did you what did you put in this? I'm afraid Astrid doesn't talk too much. Not since her father was taken from us. Oh, so when is the little one due? Six weeks. Yeah, so we're well into her third trimester And will the baby be born here Here? Oh, no, no, no. No, we're just here to make arrangements for the house and then in a couple weeks we'll head back so I can still fly. Wow. That is a striking piece of art. Oh. Yeah, that's been with my family for Generations. Oh, and what is the writing say? Tré skuggans a strond hússins hinna dauou. - Old Norse. - Oh. The tree of the shadow on the shores of the House of the Dead. Okay. But that's a lot to wrap your teeth around. So, we just called him, the Slumbering One. The Slumbering One. Hmm Hinn sofandi. Local myth. Iceland has its elves. Ireland has leprechauns. The rest of Norway has its trolls and we have this lovely fellow. And what is this Slumbering One do, exactly? The clue is in the name. He sleeps. Sometimes he dreams. And that's it. I wish I could offer you something, more exciting. Well, you should rename him the lazy one. Yeah, maybe we should. The scarecrow outside. No, we don't get too many crows around here. Oh, I assumed it was there to scare something. It's very sinister looking. if you don't mind me saying. No, I don't mind. My husband might. Oh your husband. Yeah, it was meant as a tribute to my late husband. Oh God, I'm sorry. When a member is taken from us, it is customary to erect a Tupilaq, in the image of the Slumbering One. To celebrate the time permitted. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. It was dark outside. I probably didn't see it very well. No. No, that's all right. You didn't offend in the slightest and really it's no prettier in the daylight. It's just another antiquated community custom dates back more years than we have counted. You'll see them scattered all over town if you care to look. My husband was nothing if not a traditionalist. Nobody built one of those remember my dad. No. I'm so sorry they didn't. What are you doing tomorrow? Uhm. If you'd like to learn more about our community traditions, you should really come and witness Altarisganga. Altaris-What? Annual Sacrament. I'm surprised you don't remember I presided over all six of your Altarisganga when you were a child - Really? - And your mother and your father and just about anyone else who has called this place home for the last 30 years, Wow. Okay. It's settled you are a coming tomorrow. Skol. Skol. Cheers. Cheers. Well, another interesting evening. I can't deny that. Man people are so friendly here. Not like back home. Astrid was certainly friendly. No, I think she was kind of simple. Is that how you like them? Well, I did marry you. She couldn't keep her eyes off you all night. She's only human. And so are you? Hey, what's this supposed to mean? Don't worry I don't blame you. I found it difficult not to stare myself. She's a very beautiful girl. You... are a very beautiful woman. Come on let's face it we both know I'm a whale Sexiest goddamn whale in the entire goddamn ocean. Thanks. And you know, what's sexy whales deserve? If you're gonna say good harpooning, I'm actually gonna divorce you. If you were planning on divorcing me you probably should have done it before I became a property baron though. No, that makes no sense. The best time for me to divorce you is after you become property baron. Oh really, I see. - This is weird. - Weird is good. No, I don't think that your unborn child is gonna think the same. Well, we'll use his college fund to pay for a therapist. No. Uh uh, no. It's just been a strange couple of days, okay? We're both tired and emotional. Go take a cold shower if you need to. Let's just go to sleep. Why don't we take a hot shower together instead? Isaac go to sleep! Isaac I'm pregnant! I'll be gentle. Isaac I'm being serious. Get off me. Isaac. Get off me! How'd you sleep? Like a baby. How did you sleep? Like the dead. It's alright for some? Okay I take it back. This is the creepiest thing I've ever seen. Isaac, come on! Hi Isaac! Come on! Come, we're being called. What? She wants to come in. You're joking. Come on, it will be fun. Uh, hypothermia when you're pregnant is not fun. Suit yourself. Are you serious? Yeah! Isaac! My dear child. I cannot tell you how grateful we all are for your return. Thank you. I will translate so you know what you speak. Repeat after me. Oh mighty slumbering one. Oh mighty slumbering one I call to thee. I call to thee. In calm. In storm. In sun and snow. In calm. In storm. In sun and snow. take my blood, my flesh, my body, My soul. Take my blood, my flesh, My body, my soul. I come to thee. I come to thee. My protector, my destroyer, My darkness, My light. My protector, my destroyer, my darkness, my light. I come to thee. I coming to thee. In Darkest Day In Darkest Day. And brightest night. And brightest night. Ground control to Major Tom. Can you hear me? huh? Hi, - Hi. - You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Just daydreaming About what? You know. Everything. Oh Christ, you haven't been converted have you? What? Well you're not going to start wearing robes and speaking in tongues, right? You know, it's unbecoming to knock somebody else's culture, right? Are you being serious? Not to mention incredibly close-minded. Excuse me? Now you wouldn't dare to belittle Christianity or Judaism or Islam. In fact, you be the first one on the picket line to finding the right to exist. Who's begrudging anybody's right to exist. No, it's - hypocritical. - How am I a hypocrite? do you think that it's rational to believe that a man can walk on water? No, or that, some Arabian warlord flew to the moon on a winged horse. No. Or in a four-armed elephant God. Okay, what are you talking about? Hm. I'm going to go for a walk. - Okay. - Don't wait up. Jesus. I'm sorry. I didn't realize there was anybody out there. Aren't you cold? I'll leave you in peace. Shall I? Why do you think leaving will bring peace? I just thought you might want to be left alone. We will all have eternity to spend alone. Some company in the meantime can offer a pleasant distraction. Don't you agree? Beautiful isn't it? You know how the Aurora Borealis is formed? It occurs when charged particles emitted from the sun during a solar flare penetrates the Earth's magnetic shield. And collides with atoms and molecules in the atmosphere. At least that's what science tells us. Science. Absolutely. Science might tell us how what it fails to tell us is why. Don't you agree? What's the matter? Just a nightmare. What kind of nightmare? I was doing the dishes, and there was something in the sink and it tried to drown me. Of course you'd have a nightmare about doing the dishes. Tak. You're welcome. So, what do you think? Just how I like it? - Thank you. - Oh, no the house I mean. The house, - yes well it's beautiful. - Isn't it? - They built these places to last. - They did. It will certainly still be standing when we have all been and gone. Do you mind? No, of course. Got to keep the blood sugar levels up. For how long has it been in your family? Generations. Yeah, a wonderful family home. When are you do? Five weeks. So we're a bit anxious about getting the ball rolling. How quickly to places usually sell around here? Places don't come up that often on this particular island to be honest. Which makes it all the more desirable right? Maybe? What do you mean by maybe? Well, sometimes it's difficult to judge these things. Look, we're open to offers. So somebody's going to get the steal of the century. I grant you the house has got a lot going for it. Mhmm. Robust build. About the About the best water pressure I've seen. Spectacular location. I mean many of the community here, have never even set foot on the mainland. They have everything they need right here. It's a goddamn paradise. People would die to live here. It kind of represents the problem. Call it... superstitious nonsense a lot of folks are adverse to living in a murder house. Yeah, and that's something that we have to declare. I'm afraid so. I know we have a reputation but there are limits. So a new lick of paint and some double glazing and you never know. We might just get lucky. Thanks. No, thank you and dream well. How is it? Good, great. Glad you're enjoying it. So... I've been thinking about what the realtor was saying No. Anything can be sold. It's about finding the right price. What's the right price? Well, I don't know. We'll just have to do more research the way I see it is whatever we get is a bonus. A bonus? Mmm. I mean, come on. This place was unexpected. It's been sat empty for 25 years. 25 years. - If sat for another 25 years - - A home shouldn't be empty. No, of course not. What I'm trying to say is I don't feel like we've lost anything. I think we lost a lot. But I think we gain more. I don't follow. Why would we leave? Why would we leave this place? Are you serious? What are we going to go back for? Our friends. - Our family - What friends what family? Our friends, our family. Friends? You mean acquaintances. Whose idea of a deep and meaningful conversation revolves around the next pair of shoes they're going to buy. - That's not true. - And family who see once a year. At Thanksgiving just remind us why we spend the rest of the year avoiding them. - That's not true either. - Yes it is don't delude yourself. Delude myself? Wow, that's rich. Oh, I suppose you're going to say we've got friends and family here. I am, actually. Oh my God, we've been here for a fucking week. That's beside the point. - No, it's not. - Yes. It is. The point is we may have been here a week. But in that time we've already experienced a greater sense of community - and acceptance than 25 years back home - Speak for yourself. I wouldn't have to if you actually made an effort to assimilate. Assimilate I don't have to fucking assimilate. This is not my home. But it could be. I would rather slit my wrists than call this place home. Well, that's a little dramatic. Okay, it's dramatic. All right. So you'll think about it? No, I will... there is nothing to think about. I'm gonna get some air. There's a surprise. Don't wait up. I won't. Okay, you know women. you can't live with them and you can't murder them without possible legal ramifications No but she just doesn't get it. She doesn't understand the meaning of roots Of, of, of community. She... I mean what better possible place could there be to raise a child? I mean damn sight more desirable than a country where you don't know, From one moment to the next who's gonna shove a gun in your face. Where, where the meaning of life is to sit behind a desk trying to earn as much money as possible. The thing about women is that they don't actually know what they want. No, no, no, no. Women want to be dominated. They might talk about the equality, but they certainly don't respect those who offer it. The only reason she wants to go is because you want to stay. Mmm, if you wanted to leave she'd be begging you to stay gives her something to bitch about But I do want to stay. Of course you do. This is your goddamn home. It is my home. - To home! - To home! To goddamn home. Why are you standing there, come on. - Please. - Alright alright, alright. Keep them coming. Keep them coming. v\Keep them coming. Whooo! I'm impressed. You can't be a corporate drone without picking up a certain skill set. Isn't this a little wasteful? Can't be very easy to find golf balls around here. Don't worry. They always eventually come back with the tide. But thank you. This place is fucking magical. Magical. That's one way of putting it. What do you mean? Well, some say that the lights is God's playful reminder that the world will end in a fiery hell. Doesn't sound very playful. The world is indeed comic but the joke is on mankind. Isaac. Yeah. I need to show you something. Isaac! What are you doing? Isaac! Isaac! Isaac! Isaac! Isaac stop! What the hell are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? I don't even know what it looks like you're doing. I'm building a Tupilaq. Why? Because it's a cultural tradition. Well genital mutilation is a cultural tradition. Some traditions should probably just die out. There you go again, with that bigotry. Where did you even get this stuff. Gunnar gave it to me. That was nice of him. Yeah, it was. No, one had the decency to erect one of these for my father. I'm gonna make sure I don't make the same mistake. - Right. - Yeah. Do you need any help? I'm definitely alright on my own. Thank you. Okay. Well I'm going to go to the store so... So I'll leave you to it. Yeah. What the hell was that? Don't worry. It's just a child in his bed. Well is he okay? He doesn't like the nightmares. Right. I'm sorry about the mess. I'll pay for it. A woman in your condition shouldn't be carrying these. Oh no, I can manage. Thank you. I'm sure you can but doesn't mean you have to. Thanks. Boy or girl Oh we're not sure. I thought they can tell by those scans these days? We don't want to know. Well, why not? I don't know, we just thought as long as it's healthy then it's not that important to us. No preference? No, as long as it's healthy. Good. What are you doing? I'm gonna tell you the sex of the child. Ah yes, yes. Could you feel that? Well I felt a kick but I'm always feeling a kick. - He's just impatient to come out, that's all. - He? Oh, Yes. Certainly he. How do you know? Do you think it's lady like to kick with such force? I think if you're trapped anywhere being ladylike doesn't really come into it Definitely a boy. Boys are simply biologically stronger than girls. No girl would kick with such force. Hmm. Don't worry child you will be released into the world soon enough. So I bumped into Gunnar on my way back from the store. Did you? You know, you didn't want to know the sex of our child. It's a boy. According to Gunnar anyway That's nice. Hmm. Apparently he's psychic. I got work to do. Isaac! Isaac! Isaac! Isaac! He's coming, he's coming, he's coming. No, no, no, uh... - Don't panic, just breath. - Oh he's coming! I gotta call an ambulance, okay. No, no no, no! I have to go! He's coming! He's coming! Alright, alright, alright! Oh, Jesus! Fuck I see the head! Oh my God! Oh my God! Push! Again, again! That's it baby, you can do it! You can do it! Oh my God, that's it! Push! Oh my God! Oh my God... Oh my God... - He's beautiful. - Let me see him. You did it! He's beautiful. Let me see him. Please let me see him. Isaac. It's beautiful, isn't it? Look, I know it's been difficult over the last few days. But we need to make a decision about going back home. I thought you already made that decision for us both. Well what I mean is Am I part of the decision-making process now. I mean an actual leaving date. So what do you think? Do you care what I think? Of course, I care what you think. I think you're the most selfish woman I've ever met in my entire life. And I think you might just have lost her mind. Actually, that's not fair. I'm being a little harsh. I think it's a tie between you and my mother. Your mother was not selfish. She was selfless. She obviously left this place to protect her child and that's exactly what I'm going to do. With or without you. - Really? - Really. How do you plan on doing that? Are you serious? Oh my God. Do you know how hilarious you look when you try to act tough? It's like watching a goldfish imitate a shark. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to go up there and pack my bags and get the fuck off of this godforsaken hellhole And you can stay and play dress up with your little friends. You're not going anywhere. I said you're not going anywhere. I'm packing my bags. - Don't touch me! - Don't make me hurt you! - Touch me! - Be still! Get off me! You fucking bitch! No. You fucking bitch! No! Hello! Hello! Hello! Thank God. Can I help you? Yes, you can't help me. I need to go, now. I need to go to the mainland Come back tomorrow 9 a.m. Oh, no, I need to go now. Come back tomorrow 9 a.m. It's an emergency. Mmhm. - What kind of emergency? - The kind that won't wait until tomorrow? Yeah. Yeah. Well, you see I'm not really equipped for emergencies. I'm more of a turtle than a hare. I have money. You know, that's good because I don't do this for the joy of it. I have anything you need and I can get more on the mainland. I just need Go now, please. And what are you some kind of fugitive? You can't have robbed a the bank as this place doesn't have one. Please. Just name your price. Where's your husband? He's not coming. Decided to stay this time, did he? You know, he caused quite the commotion last time he left. Place has never quite been the same since. You know about that? Well certainly did little to endear me to the local populace In hindsight, I probably should have acted with a bit more fortitude, but I was young and she, she was quite a siren. What can you do? So you took her and you won't take me. No offense, but you're not quite my type. Look, I am pregnant, okay. I need to go, now. - Hey, just name your price, okay. - Listen. You could offer me all the pearls in the ocean, but I still couldn't take you. Why? What are they going to do to you? They? I'm not scared of those peasants. Then what are you scared of? That. There's a storm coming. She doesn't want you to leave, you know. Trust me what she wants she always gets. Emma! What's wrong? I'm so sorry, I didn't know where to go. - and you're a police officer so. - What's happened? I think he might be dead. Here you go. I'd offer you something stronger, but the baby. Thank you. Take a deep breath. Okay now tell me. Who do you think might be dead? Isaac. Why do you think Isaac is dead? Because, I hit him over the head. He went insane. I'm telling you, that house, it is curse or it is haunted by his mother and his father, and now this. Why do you think he's gone insane? Because he tried to attack me. So it was self-defense. Oh God, of course, it was self-defense. You really think I would just go around smacking someone over the head for the sake of it? Who's to say. Who can fathom what goes on in that tiny little head of yours? Renate, Renate. you need to get him out of here. Okay, he's insane. Renate. Whatever he is told you okay? Don't listen to him. Listen to me. You need to get a psychiatrist or someone okay, because he's gone in the head. Whose fault is that? - Sweetie. - Renate please okay do something. Cause he needs help. Yeah? Oh God. I don't feel to... too good. What? Uh, I... Dream well, baby. There's something, in the water. You have no idea. Don't struggle, baby. He doesn't like it when you struggle. It's unbecoming. And you need to accept your fate. It's I come to thee, not I run from thee. At least the child gets it. he's been itching to get out of there ever since he got in. Haven't you son? Well my boy. Time to fulfill your destiny. This was never your son's destiny. This was always your destiny! You should have just fulfilled it 25 years ago. You have no idea the suffering you have cost us. Don't worry. You'll get used to it.
