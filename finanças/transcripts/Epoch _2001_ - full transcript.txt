Forgot to pay your electric bill again, doc. I will miss your jokes. Really? Really thought of myself is that funny. Well, i'm sure not gonna miss those horse needles of yours, doc. I'm sorry the treatments were not more helpful. So, how long have i got? Twelve months, perhaps more. Take a long vacation. The less stress, the more time you'll have. That will come and go. In the morning it will be worst. Telling me. I don't think it's a good idea for you to drive back to the united states. I'll be fine. There's a lot of bad country between here and the border. Muchos hombres, malos cabrones. Yeah. but what are they gonna do, doc? Kill me? Amigo, life is precious. You have to make the most of it however long you have. You're right. Try to make peace with yourself and life, mason. You know, in strategic weapons design, there is an oxymoron for life. Well, if you can't make peace with your life at least try to make peace with your car. That's nancy. Born on the eve of woodstock. We struggled through the years of the reagan youth, only to become chic in the new millennium. We've both seen better days. Well, my prayers are with you. Vaya con dios. Thanks, doc. Good luck. - Thanks. Hello, miss czaban, this is nurse foley at lincoln clinic. I'm afraid i have some bad news. The test results from the insemination were negative. The doctor would like to see you for another examination. Please call back and set up an appointment. Hello? Scientists are still in a loss to explain the phenomena which caused massive power disruptions throughout the world today. A statement from the home secretary describes the occurrence as a natural atmospheric discharge originating from the bhutan region near central asia. The shockwave recorded by n.a.s.a. satellites in the early hours of this morning, discloses the phenomenon as the principle cause of the power outrages that created chaos throughout the nation today. Chinese and indian government officials have denied any knowledge of the incident while u.s. military spokesman have stated that the shockwave could be a direct result of a continual testing of neutron-type-weapons, by either china or the other respective asian governments. I'll be right there, sir. And so it boils down to three questions. What is it? Where did it come from? And who, in the name of god, put it there? We don't know, on all three counts. And until we do, i'm issuing a recommendation to the president that our activities be officially classified. And that whatever this thing is, it be considered non-passive until it's proven to be otherwise. I want any and all information gathered to be processed through this department. Ladies and gentlemen, i would suggest you contact your husbands, wives, whomever. It looks like we may be here for some time. Sir, it's a little late to keep this from a public enquiry. Secrecy will only generate more interest. Thanks to those morons at the white house. The public has been told that it is a weather phenomena. That's all they need to know right now. The only witnesses of this thing are these bhutaniacs. Bhutanese, sir. Whatever. They see its arrival as a religious occurrence. Well, that's a blessing. No pun intended. As long as we're talking religion, nobody will give a damn. If, however, it becomes alien then we have hysteria. That's true. According to the local nomads, they have observed the dead brought back to life, the sick cured. People, um, i need to know where we are. The public's perception is the president's primary concern. Sam, at this juncture, we know very little. Now i've assembled a research team. And there will be military support but it will be nominal. Sir, the king of bhutan has invited us to study the object. Military presence however small could provoke uncooperative reaction. Well, we'll just have to take that chance. We're right on the chinese border. We have to have backup. I agree. But i want a low profile, al. I do not want this to become an international incident. I trust that everyone in this room understands that. When does the research team arrive? Well, the base camp is going in right now as we speak. And i am still putting together the team. Who do you have to lead it? Can you send her in, please? You should look at this. Good day, everyone. Good morning, ma'am. You can sit here. Thank you. Have you been briefed? Yes, i have, sir. You are the one who helped us in pakistan, right? Yes, sir. Well, miss, um... czaban. Czaban? Unfortunately, this situation is considerably more complex. We are not dealing with fanatics. We're dealing with something unknown. A delicate approach will be a key. I understand. We found rand yet? Yes, sir. we're picking him up right now when we expect to be at the bhutan site within 14 hours. Shit. Yeah. You know these old cars. Si. we know the old cars. You're far away from home, amigo. It shows? What do you got in there? Nothing much. Just some dirty clothes. New george jones c.d. you fellows like george jones? He's my favorite. That's it? Yeah, that's it. Except, of course, the $500,000 in cash in the trunk. Trying to be funny, pendejo? I thought i was doing pretty well. Things can get really shitty for gringos around here. You're not shitting me. Let me ask you something. Have you ever brushed your teeth? You wanna die, cabron? Do i have a choice? - No. Why'd you ask? Adios, pendejo. I don't know a fucking word of spanish. It means goodbye asshole. Yeah. now i know at least two. Adios, pendejos! Now what? Not some romeo act. Hi. mason rand. You mind telling me what i'm doing here? Captain tower over there. Captain tower. It sounds like a comic book, doesn't it? Anyway, he said that, i'd be briefed upon arrival at the site. Got any idea what site he was talking about? You'll be briefed on arrival. You rehearsed together. Um... so do i get to know your name, or do i get to find that out on arrival at the site? I'm dr. kasia czaban, science advisor for the n.s.a. n.s.a.? So you're one of lysander's kids? Lysander hired me, i hired you. Well now, that's funny because i don't remember anybody offering me a job. Read the small print in your commission contract. It's not an offer. I signed that contact over five years ago. Next time you'd be more careful about what you sign. Right. So what's the job? You'll be briefed on arrival. At the site. Right, right. They say you can elucidate any technology within 24 hours. How it works? How it operates? How to decommission it? - Me? Who told you that? I read your file. Employed at the age of 19 at the skunk works in area 51? No such place. You got the wrong guy. Right. Actually we're on route to asia, bhutan, to be exact. Bhutan? What's our coordinates? Well, mr. rand, they say a picture is worth a thousand words. Jesus christ. What is it? We don't know. My god. Hold it right there. Let's see some i.d. - Identification? Come on. come on. Here you go. All right. So what're the dimensions for this thing? About a half mile high, about a quarter mile in diameter, its widest point. How long has it been here? - The local people claim it raised itself out of the ground approximately 60 hours ago. It must be using the earth's gravity to suspend itself. Like two magnets, you know, they repel each other. It creates an anti-gravitational field for it to float on. The key is the balance. Their gyroscopes must be so far advance beyond anything we've ever seen. What the hell is that? We'll be using it as our forward base to talk with the object and hopefully to find a way inside. So what tent do we sleep in? These are all the data we have on the object. You can review it in your quarters. Great. So what do you think about all this, sergeant? Captain. - Whatever. I'm not paid to think. Come on. you can't be apart of this not to think anything. Yes, you can. Good. Now you better get some rest. You'll need it. Any more questions? No, no. This, this should do it. Great. Consider yourself briefed, mr. rand. Mr. rand, i presume? I'm dr. solomon. I was told that there's something that you should see. Yeah. Hi. good morning. Now come on, go with me. What'd you say your name was? Solomon, doctor on call. Mason rand. kidnap victim. Yeah. aren't we all? Come on, there's some coffee in the med unit. Hello. What do you got to do with all this, little buddy? Where's the coffee? No, i lied. Besides, it's bad for your heart. What happen to your head? I got, pistol whipped by some, pendejos? Well. Ouch! I think you'll live. Mason. Mason. They say that this kid was dead, and that object brought him back to life. Do you speak english, ma'am? What was he supposed to have died from? Diphtheria, dehydration. Typical for young deaths in bhutan. You don't even look sick. I know. All his vitals are normal. So what do you think? What do i think? I'm an engineer. Human biology was never in my bag. I know. The point is, do you think that that object had anything to do with his reanimation? I supposed it could have triggered, you know, some jolt of emotion and the rush of adrenaline might have revived him from a death like coma. I don't know. What do you think? Well, the holy man around here has a different idea. No doubt. what is it? That object was sent from god to start a new beginning or a new ending. Beginning and end? The armageddon and the rupture. I see the old religious paradox is still alive and well in bhutan. Here, here. What? What is it? Nothing. i'll talk to you later. Good morning, dr czaban. The doctor find you? Yeah. - And? Yeah, the boy. Cute little fellow, isn't he? He's alive enough. Of course, i never saw him when he was supposed to be dead. We'll have to keep him for further analysis. Right now, we have to figure out an access inside this thing. Do you've any ideas? You have a live feed for this? Yeah. yeah, we do. Hold on. Excuse me. Nine. That was where we started, but radar indicated it was solid rock. Are there any other markings, indentations, anything, anywhere else on the surface of this - what do are we gonna call it anyway? The locals are calling it the taurus. Taurus? Any other marks? - No. Then that's where we start. Right there. Look, we told you before. You're not going to pass. That's a final. Mason, why don't you sit here? Secure positions. So what do you got from the surface analysis? Combination of ceramic and metal. So far, it's been impossible to date. I know some women... Don't... say it. So what's your plan? Well, there's basically two factors we got to consider. One, if whoever or whatever built these thing has invited us and wants us to come inside, well, i think the answer will present itself relatively quickly. And the other? We're not on the guest list, we could be banging on the door for quite awhile and not get in. Well, let's hope we're on the guest list. Guns, guns, guns. Is this really the signal you wanna send this thing? We need to be prepared. Mr. rand, we're here to protect you. Yeah, from what? This team can handle most any threat. Really? So you're quite experienced with alien technologies, i guess? I follow orders. I hope that does not become a problem. Yeah, me too. We have two bogies closing in. Section 17, grid a-11. Mig. Sir? sir. What? what is it? Satellite has picked up a pair of fighters leaving chinese airspace, heading towards the bhutan base. Shit. Get captain tower on the horn for me. Yes, sir. Colonel, you may have a job this time. Yes, sir. All right, we've reached the target. Dr. czaban, mr. rand, your move. Okay. How many fingers you got on the gantry probe? Ten. - Great. I'm gonna need nine of 'em. Place one finger in each of those little circular indentations on the front. What you are doing? I got a theory. Would you care to share with me? It's beautiful, really. I think these nine indentations represent the nine planets in our solar system. Okay. That's the key. I hope. I think it'll get us inside. All right, do it. All right, let's get the wind up. All arms are aligned in each hole. Now what? - Okay, now... i need the configuration of the exact position of all the planets right down to their coordinates. Can you get me that? Great, great. All right, can you see that? Line 'em up just exactly like that. Okay. i'm at maximum power. Nothing. They're just holes in solid rock. Just give me a second, captain. Keep your shirt on. Briggs, bring up the detonators. Yes, sir. God, captain? Could you just relax and maybe polish your grenade or something? I'm not finished. Captain? Hold off. Thank you. All right, rotate them the other way, counterclockwise. There we go. What the hell just happened? The luckiest guess i've ever seen. Well, i'd rather be lucky than good, captain. Charlie waters said that. Men, on alert. All right, let's get in there and see what this thing's all about? We are not just going to walk inside there without knowing what's in it. What do you suggest we do, captain? Move in a tracker camera. Make a detailed probe, scan for contamination. If it checks, we send in a second probe, thus minimizing the risk to human life. Yeah, that's a great idea if we had the time, but we don't. Those migs are almost on top of us now. We're less than a hundred miles from the chinese border. I'll tell you what. You play with your toys, i'm going inside. I can't let you do that, mr. rand. I'm sorry, captain, under different circumstances, i would agree, but we have run out of time. Prepare your men to enter. Men, enter the airlock. Now listen, i know you've been right so far, but don't block him. I have enough problems. Am i understood? He had a problem with his daddy... Now i said, am i understood? Yes, sir... ma'am. Son of a... All right, moving out. Sir, yes, sir. All clear. Doesn't appear to be any indication of contamination. - great. - but that doesn't mean there isn't any. We should take a sample back for further analysis before we continue. Affirmative, captain, withdraw your men. Come on, we just got here. Damn it, rand. This is the last time i'm gonna warn you. We go out of here and that door closes. I can't guarantee that combination is gonna work again to get us back in. What's wrong with you? What the hell are you doing? Put that back on. See? nothi... you all right? Rand, are you all right? Mason, are you all right? Mason, are you okay? Gotcha. Get him out of here until i give the order, otherwise. Come on, don't you people want to take a chance? Now you're going out of chances, pal. Take him out of here. Man. get your fucking hands off of me. Captain tower, i want you to continue on. We won't be needing the tests. I will monitor you from the control room. Take them off. You stupid ass! I am not letting your irresponsible bullshit get one of my men killed! You're right. It will not happen again. Sir? Yes, sir. dr. czaban. Yes, sir, they just did a fly by. Listen, we still have a little time before the chinese can get a ground unit there. So where are you at this time? We've managed to have an access. We have the forward team inside. What about rand? He is with me, sir. I feel he'll best be used as an observer at this point. Now you listen to me. We need to obtain as much information about this thing as possible before the chinese get there. So you can rand's ass inside, do you understand me? Yes, sir. I will be on the ground in three hours. Okay. Where do you think you're going? I'm going back inside. Just like the man said. I follow orders. No, you sit your smart ass back down. He doesn't know you. And you do? - Just watch the screens. We don't go back inside until the troops make sure the area is clear. What is it? Mason, any ideas? Can't tell from here. Maybe some sort of storage tanks for fuel or energy. But just can't tell from in here. I gotta get back in there. Sir, i think i found a way in. We've located a break in one of the stems. Shall we proceed? Go ahead. Try to enter. Keep your com link open. Yeah, you heard it. Keep it tight, keep an eye on your side man. I don't want anybody getting lost. Tower, what's your position? We're about 60 meters from the bottom of the shaft. Hold your position until the migs have completed their circle. Tower, can you hear me? Captain tower, can you hear me? Hold your positions. Hold your fire. Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Tower, come in! Captain tower! I bet he fired. Damn it. Where is briggs? Anybody got a 20 on briggs? - Briggs. Briggs? where's briggs? All right, we'll take it from here. Shit! - What did they say? What did they say? Two chinese migs just blew up making a high speed pass over the site. What happened? What do you mean, what happened? Did we shoot them down? No, but we can't prove it. The object was seen releasing some sort of a... i don't know, energy discharge, but none of our wonderful long range scanners recorded it or even picked it up. The planes were flying recon over the area when the energy burst hit and so of course, it looks like we shot them down. Jesus christ. We don't have much time before they respond. God. You know, if that thing proves to be aggressive, we may be left with only one option. Is someone gonna answer the phone? Yeah, go ahead. Hello. Yes, mr. president. Yes. No, i'm afraid they're both unattainable at this time, sir. No, we don't have the exact details. This is pamela chanser. Yes, yes, i'll tell them. Yes, yes, i know, i know. If the chinese start making a noose, our heads are the ones going in it, right? That's right. Two migs just went down. Chinese won't be sitting in their hands, sir. Suggestions, colonel? I suggest we put our troops on the ground and seal the perimeter. What happened? We lost briggs. We were attacked by some sort of energy force. Attacked or threatened, captain? Who fired the first shot? Well, we guess we learned our first lesson about the taurus. It reacts in kind to aggressive behavior. I just lost one of my men! And that's an attack! Captain, release him now! Doctor. mr. lysander's on the wire. Sir, this is czaban. We pulled out, sir, we lost one of the rangers inside. What happened? Lysander, this is rand. I will tell you what happened. Captain tower and his howling commandos were in the taurus and they started shooting. Well, the thing reacted. We're dealing with rudimentary instincts here. This thing will defend itself. Now we got to get the military out. It's too late for that, rand. The chinese forces are on their way. We at least pull them back to the perimeter and keep them hell out of the taurus. Okay, okay. Have tower redeploy his forces. And mason? I'm here. Go in there and get a handle on what this thing does, do you understand? And have tower meet me back at the base camp. Right. We're going back in. This time without the g.i. joes. Captain? Captain? Captain, do you copy? Did you find anybody? Nothing over here. Whoa! Chinese military sources today say that a large unknown object was discovered in bhutan near the chinese border. Chinese officials have reported that an illegal u.s. military operation has taken control over the area and has shot down two chinese civilian planes. This is jessica keats coming to you live in bhutan. Damn them. What a lot of crap, damn it. I want you to contact your friends at the u.n. tell them, tell them something. Don't mention anything about the discovery. Ambassador po? - Ambassador po. Got it. I'm not answering at this time. All right, ladies, move it out! Move, move, move! Who's that? Chinese army. How many do you think they are? All of them. Where are they? Dr. czaban and rand are inside. Well, that's good. Sir, i want it stated for the record that i want everyone pulled out of the object until we understand what powers are at work in there. I just watched one of my men disappear. Your objection is noted, captain. But we have a very limited time in between to control the situation. Those jets are just a precursor to a ground assault. Are you all right? - Yeah. I think it kind of levels off up here. It's more level up here. - Okay. What are you looking for? Anything that i can recognize. Mason. You know how to tap dance. Mason. What? Jesus, god. What happened? We have to get out of here. Mr. ambassador. Thank you. Mr. hudson, i believe we have a problem. A problem, ambassador? We prefer to see it as more of a misunderstanding. On whose part? Well that's what this meeting is for, sir. To analyze where we're misperceiving one another. Analyze? Your government has taken control of an object which is well within our sphere of influence. If i'm not mistaken, sir, bhutan is a sovereign nation. So was nepal. However, i think we can settle this diplomatically. I hope so. All we want is to be given equal access to this object so that we may analyze whether this phenomena is a threat to china and its neighbors. Well, equal access, that's simple. You are right and that is something we understand. Now i will have to confirm with the president and the joint chiefs of staff. However... And this is not a request, mr. hudson. Please, have some noodles. Thank you, i will. This is a mandatory action. Can i have a fortune cookie? Chu-li. So that you and i understand each other perfectly, this object is in the sovereign country of bhutan, i will have to confer... Just leave it, thank you. I will have to confer with the president and the president does not react well to the threats. - and your president is not the leader of the world. - granted... My government situation is this, that we are given either total access to that object or we will destroy it. How do you think you gonna destroy this thing. You already lost two aircrafts in a fly by. Well, their sacrifices have taught us the intention of this machine and the uncooperative nature of your government. Our troops have been inside and instructed to defend it. Then it is your turn to know the meaning of sacrifice. Excuse me? It is time for you to go. What are you doing? Pain is gone. Dr. solomon? Do you have the equipment here to give me an electromyography? Yeah, we do. why? Twelve months ago i was diagnosed with a.l.s., lou gehrig's disease. I was told i had a year to live. And now it just seems... could you please just give me the test? Sure. I thought you read my file. I did. I guess you missed the medical part. Doc, is he okay? Will know more after i finish my tests. What happened, sir? I was hoping you could tell me. Don't remember. Look. he's in shock but he'll be fine. There's no sign of disease. What the hell's going on here? Well, before i went inside the taurus, i had a.l.s. i'd been given a year to live. And now... there's absolutely no sign of the disease. What... it cured you? Apparently. And i believe that this change in my condition gives us a great incite into what makes this thing tick. Which is? Obviously it can manipulate cellular structure. That still doesn't tell us where the hell it came from? The radioactive dating of the rocks taken at the depth from which the taurus arose, it has to be at least 4 billion years old. Before the beginning of life. And if it can do what it did for me in one day, it must be able to reconstitute d.n.a. but that doesn't explain why and who put it here. Well, who, we may never know but why... If we can reconstitute d.n.a., it may have been the original catalyst for the development of life on earth. Right. i mean, all throughout history, there have been various stages of evolution where it just didn't quite match up, these blizzard jumps in the development of certain species in different periods. It's never been properly explained, now... i want to shut it down. You got to be kidding. I want it shut down or at least controlled. We have no idea what it's capable of doing. I have to disagree, sir. We may be running at the limit of time but this may be a huge mistake. Wait. you want to shut this down or control it. This could be the very thing that gave us all life. This could be the thing that for the last three millennium we've referred to as god. I don't want any part of it. Well, it's not a request, it's an order. If we can't seemingly control this thing, it will be destroyed. The stock exchange responded today to an announcement of an object found in bhutan of alien origin, with a dramatic sell-off. World reaction to the colossus has run the gamut from the spiritual to intense anger at the united states for its policy of repression of information. The united states has attempted to protect the world from the irresponsible release of unsubstantiated information about this occurrence. Now at this time, we have teams of scientists on site who are attempting to evaluate any potential danger that this object may bring, if any. And presently i am asking my fellow americans and the rest of the world to keep an open mind. I want to know who wrote this speech. Colson. I thought he was under surveillance. - Do you want him under surveillance? - Yeah. I am here to join you in researching the taurus. You have no authorization. This is an autonomous territory. We have the right to study the object as much as you do. Your government does not have the sole right to dictate over a discovery of this magnitude. The bhutanese government invited our team here. I don't think you got the same invitation. A country the size of bhutan is not in any position to make that decision. Yeah, well they did. And until there's a diplomatic solution, i want you to move all your men back and if you refuse, that we're gonna have to defend ourselves. We have four divisions two kilometers from here. Do you honestly think your threats have any bearing? Try us. You are a very foolish man. Now, i'm to proceed to the site location. If you proceed, my men will shoot. Those are my orders. Hold your fire. Hold your fire. Hold your fire! Get the doctor up here! Get the doctor! The bullet went through his heart. He should be dead. I know. This is impossible. They were dead, like you. This is impossible. Captain tower, is that a bible you're reading? Yes, you have problem with that? Do you think this thing may have something to do with god? Don't. All right. Look, my job is to find out - anything and everything i can about the taurus. - all right? And i learned a long time ago not to discount any theories, so what do you think? Since i was a kid i tried to imagine what god would look like. And from what i've seen i can tell you that thing was not sent by god. As you can see, we're surrounded by these colossal tanks. They seem to line the entire circumference. Got it. Possibly some sort of storage medium or a variety of gases... Carbon oxide... You're breaking up. I'm losing picture. Now i'm gonna take you into area where we found briggs. Shit, we lost them. If we don't lose transmission. Look at this. Whoa. I don't like the looks of this. Just stay cool. If it wanted us dead, we'd be dead. One small step for mason rand. I'm not getting anything. I think we're cut off. It's an evolutionary tree? Some kind of hologram? It's like a... Like a visual diary of the history of the planet. What? What's happening? It is destroying everything. It is re-terraforming the earth. It wants to start over with something else. It's been recording the development of life, maybe altering its evolution. What happened? We're alive, but something tells me it's time to maybe we observe from outside. Let's go. All right. we're gonna have to jump. Jump? jump where? Back into the rover. Now you go when i tell you. What? are you crazy? All right, i make a deal, jump together, all right? Jesus, all right. Ready? All right, here it comes. Ready? jump. Mr. williams. Mr. williams. Jesus, pam. The president is on the line for you, sir. God, you didn't tell him... We have a situation change at the site. What change? I believe it's best if you come see for yourself. God, okay. Thanks for the coffee. Sure. Glenn. Glenn, your mistress is at your house. She is talking to your wife. What? She's not even in town. It's generating cloud cover one mile thick, expanding out at about 265 miles per hour. Well, i was... I was thinking that, um, maybe we should go back to the firm resolve approach. At its current rate, it will cover the earth in approximately 90 hours. Good god. This means massive crop failures in 30 days. All vegetation in the oceans will die within five weeks. We're gonna have the beginnings of a new ice age within two months. Are you... yes, sir. All right. all right, sir. Yes, sir. Are you finished? Sam, he just ordered us to go to phase two. There is an alien device creating a cloud cover that could destroy the world in 30 days. There's a chinese division less than ten clicks from here. Just another day in paradise? You are the man with all the answers. What have you got? From what we learned in the dome, this cloud cover may be a part of the taurus' purpose. It may be starting to re-terraform the planet. Re-terraform the planet? What the hell is that? Re-terraform, it's a sort of black out period to end the evolution of one species to make way for the development of another. The internal memory of the taurus provided us with the history of life on this planet. And guess what? There are two distinctly different strains of life. Two different family trees for the earth. We are the second strain, the second epic in earth's development. What do you mean, two? What happened with the first? Destroyed. - No, re-terraformed. There is one other possible explanation. My gut feeling is this cloud could be a negative reaction to the military activity in the area. Your gut feeling? That's right. You were in there when it happened. What were you doing? Just shooting a few hoops. Who the hell are you? We weren't doing anything, colonel. We were nearly observing it. We barely got out before it started creating the storm. Wait a minute, wait a minute. We've gotta come up with a solution here. A solution has been decided. At 15:00 hours i was ordered to proceed with phase two. Phase two? Are you out of your mind? My men are over there now, placing the tack inside the object. Listen to me, you moron, we are dealing with a technology 4 billion years more advanced than our own. Do you think that thing is gonna sit there and let us blow it up? I suggest we evacuate as quickly as possible. Allen, we cannot let this happen. Every aggressive action we've taken has elicited a negative if not violent response from this thing. I'm gonna stop it. No. What the hell are you doing, captain? Nuking this thing is not a solution. My men will not let him stop them. They will kill him. Hi. Get that nuke set all right? I'm gonna just check it out. Why the hell was i circumvented? Who issued the order to proceed with a nuke? It's the president, al. His orders are to proceed. You listen to me, i want those disarm codes. Do you understand? You know, al, we don't have any more time for discussion on this. You got to pull back at least ten kilometers. I've got people inside there. The chinese divisions are within the blast range! It's gotta be down in here pretty deep. Mason, we are disobeying a direct order from the president. Do you want to risk the future of the world on one man's opinion? What do you plan to do? Disarm it, if i can. Now, come on. First, you deny us equal access to that object. And now, you want to blow it up with a nuclear bomb. Let's just thank god it's only a tactical nuke. Let's not quibble with words, mr. hudson. All right, mr. ambassador, you're right. Let's not quibble with words. May i suggest it would be prudent for your division that is near the taurus to pull back, say at least ten kilometers. By when, mr. hudson? - god... Twenty-four minutes. Twenty four minutes. God, it was closed. I hope you know what you are doing. Can we carry it out of here? No, they got motion detectors at both ends. see? God, you have to diffuse it. I know. This could be a lot harder than i thought. It's a class 15 device, almost impossible to diffuse. I don't have any of the specialty tools. What tools do you have? I got my swiss army knife. It is the top of the line. You have got to be... Move it! move it! Move it! Forward base. Do you read me? Come in. We've got less than 20 minutes if we're gonna make it out of here. I need a link up with the white house. It's not gonna happen, sir. There is too much electrical interference. God, damn it, colonel. Terminate that countdown until i have authorization from washington. I have got my authorization. You're not going anywhere, colonel. Step down, soldier. You're staying right here until either you disarm that weapon or you and i blow up with it. I'm gonna have you court marshaled. If you don't disarm that bomb, it'll be posthumously. Continue with the evacuation. Rees, no one enters this tent. Continue evacuating. I told you, the bomb cannot be disarmed. Staying here is suicide. Fuck your gear and leave the area, now! Mason. Mason? All my troops are been drawn back. Good, good. But i want you and your president to know that this is not the end of it. Do you understand me, mr. hudson? Of course, i understand that, ambassador. And i want you to know from all of us that we want to express our deepest apologies... Will you shut the hell up? "my help cometh from the lord which made heaven and earth." you are crazy. "he will not suffer thy foot to be moved, he that keepeth thee will not slumber. The lord is thy keeper and the lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. And the lord shall preserve thee from all evil. He shall preserve thy soul. The lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore. Amen." we've only got a few minutes if we gonna make it out. Disarm it. Captain tower. I told you i can't. So you go ahead and shoot, soldier. Go on. Let's not jostle it? Can you disarm it? I won't know till i get inside. Sir, i gotta believe if he's not gonna disarm the bomb by this time, he's telling the truth. You can go, colonel. Just a fact, soldier. Gentlemen, this is the last transport. You make sure all my men are on it. How's it going? We're doing all right. It's kinda like... It's like peeling an onion. I can't seem to find the center. You should go too, sir. I'm staying. It's everything i can do. Everything on the outside casing is dead. It's controlled by the inner casing. We have to get out of here. Where we gonna go? There is no time. Amigo, life is precious. You have to make the most of it however long you have. It must have absorbed the blast. Shit. we better get out of here. God, it's spinning fast. There's no way, manson. The speed's increasing. It's getting really violent. We don't have any choice. Look out! Listen to me, i'm gonna watch for the gantry. Okay. You jump when i tell you, all right? All right. All right, here it comes, ready? Now! Mason! Help. Jump. - What? The purpose of the taurus may have been to alter the course of evolution on this planet. At various times, re-terraforming the earth, promoting the extinction of one species to allow the development of another. With the generation of the cloud cover, the terraformic process seems to have been started again, then just as quickly ended with taurus' departure. What is your theory on this doctor? When dr. czaban and i entered the... Inner chamber... the brain, if you will, perhaps it re-evaluated humanity, as the species deserving a further evolution. Also, it may have felt that dr. czaban and i were becoming... close. Anyway we'll never know for sure. So i have a plane to catch. I hope you will excuse me. Thank you again, ladies and gentlemen. I need to talk to... - No, no, it's all right. K.c., come on up. Wow. It's good to see you? How are you? I'm okay. how are you? I'm all right. - Yeah? I'm all right. God, i'm sorry we haven't seen each other since bhutan. I know you've been busy. Well, so have you. I see you got quite an entourage. Yeah, well, that's the price a heretic pays in a world of religious fervor. Actually i tracked you down for a reason. Before i went to bhutan, i was trying but i couldn't... What i'm trying to say is that... Is i found out that i couldn't have any children. And i haven't been with anybody since then. Taurus cured you, right? I had no further reoccurrences, no. I think when we were in the dome... I'm pregnant. Thank you.
