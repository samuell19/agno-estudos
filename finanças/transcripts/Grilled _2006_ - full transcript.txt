If any of your neighbors told you about us but we're here, and what I'm trying to do is give away 10 free chickens with the price of just one of our meat plans. 'Sir, the one monthly amount includes everything.' Okay, no chicken for you. Mr. Simmons, hi. Maurice Burns, I'm from Valley Food Service. Yeah, come on in. 'Where do you live?' I don't really feel that, Sherman Oaks but I don't think that has anything-- Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna come to your house 'knock-knock. You wanna buy some of my crap?' - Wanna buy some of my shit? - That's okay. Sorry for wasting your time. I apologize. Have a good day, sir. Go fuck yourself. Why don't you cut your grass? I'll bet you hate to shop, Mr. Simmons. I sure do. Well, now you won't have to. Madden. See, that's the best NFL coach ever, right there. He's good in the booth but seven AFC Western Division titles. - That's the man. - What are you talking about? Madden, that's.. How do you know him? That's my mom. Hi. Can you recognize my "hi"? 'Is this Maurice?' Yes, yes, this is still Maurice. So what's my favorite redhead doing tonight? 'I don't know, Maurice. I've never had red hair.' This is Carol? 'This is Carolyn, and all my hairs are brown.' Yes. Hi. Jeez, yeah. No, I remember. Yeah, we went to the movie, right? We watched it at your place. How are you? 'Do you care? Or we could just hang up the phone right now.' - If that's what you'd like. - 'I would, yes.' Then-then let's do that. Hi, darling. How are you? Dad, did you forget my birthday? Of course not. Did you think I would? I didn't know. - I never would. - You know what I want? I think I do. You wanna tell me again? - A swing and a slide. - A swing and a slide. Yep. Here's Mommy. Don't disappoint her, Dave. It's bad of her to think of you as a loser. She doesn't think that. She needs you to be solid. Do you have any solid left? Renee, I'm doing my best. If you can, just get her something nice. That would be our top of the line model. It's 550 bucks. Wood really necessary in a swinging device? It's superior for the child. This particular model is priced way down. It's the last one we have left. Probably the last time you'll get it at this low price. - You kidding me, man? - Excuse me? Trying to pull that shit on me? - I'm sorry, sir? - That's your impending event? - My impending event? - Your impending event, Glenn. Make it big, man. Grab an issue. Talk about deforestation.

It's all there in the application. You'll get a free delivery and a freezer and 10 filets. Take it. I don't understand why we need all this meat. I'm sorry. We went over this. Andy likes filets. You likes the rib eye. 'This whole order is customized for the Wilson family.' Sally's been on this health kick lately. - It's not a kick. - Program, honey. She's been eating healthy and she wants to keep it up. Eating healthy means meat in the middle. You make the meat the hub. Let your other foods fill in around it. We were made to eat meat, originally by God. Our system works better when we give it what it was meant to have. Don't you think it's healthy to have what God meant for you to have? - I guess so. - I guess so, too. Take it for Sally's health. Honey? 'Okay, great. Good.'

I'm through. I quit. Stop it. Let's just close this. Let me show you a little smoking technique. Let her ride. 'Called a little smoking special technique.' Goldbluth showed it to me. Slam it down, slam it up. That's great. - That's a good move. - That's super. - Close what? - Two boxes. Go get the book. That is one gourmet technique right there. Are you...I don't like this guy. Nothing is right here. Let me tell you something. He's solid. Now get the book. Pull yourself together. That's sweet. You're giving me the lessons now, look at this. 'Just gonna need some information. From me to you.' 'Do you know that one time' 'he made me sit and watch this educational film on taxidermy' and then he asked me, "How much do you think it costs" 'to clean and stuff a 115 pound ape?' 'And I'm like, "What?! That's how much I weigh." 'My God, no.' 'Should I get that?' Si? - Hey. - Hello. Shh, shh, shh. 'No noise.' 'Don't you fucking speak.' Here we go, alright. We're all filled out. Okay, everything looks great. We're just gonna need you, if you would. Just, okay, right here. Yeah. - 'Oops.' - 'Shit.' - 'Well, that's okay.' - Right there? Yeah, that's fine. Just press down harder right there. - Harder than that? - It should write. - It's not working, I'm sorry. - That's okay. I'm sorry. I'm just gonna get a paper towel. God! 'Jesus! Son of a bitch!' 'How are you, Tony? You're pain in the ass.' 'Fucking God!' Okay, okay. Go to Goldbluth. Just go to him, okay? All those fucking busted parts those 1500 AK-47s, he knows all about it. - He's next. Don't worry - Go to him, go to him. 'Cause he knows all this shit, man. I think it's better to kill you. God! God damn it! - 'You mentioned that!' - 'What a fucking day!' You gotta go to him. Go to him. He knows all about it. No, it's gonna happen while you're still warm. Don't worry. But first, this is from Boris. Potty mouth. God! No! - Just relax. Relax! - Hey! Hey, hey, hey! 'What did you do?' 'Relax. You know what this is.' - 'This is this.' - 'You didn't do it.' Everything's taken care of. It's done. - My God! - 'Relax. Just relax.' - 'You're a murderer.' - We're professionals, lady. - Everything is taken care of. - A professional? - What, are you kidding? - 'Excuse me?' 'You were supposed to show up at 12:00 outside' 'not in my house, you asshole.' Be nice. Don't get nuts in here. 'It wasn't supposed to go like this!' - Suzy, what did you do? - He's dead? 'Don't act like you don't know'' - 'I can't believe he's dead.' - Right. - 'You can't believe it?' - What did you do? - 'Don't be so dramatic.' - No, por favor. Lady, be quiet! - Don't move, don't move. - What the fuck! - 'Put the gun down. Drop it!' - 'Who is he?' I'm serious. Tell him to put the gun down. Put it down! - Who the fuck are you?! - Put the gun down! 'Fuck you! Who are you?' 'Don't move. Tell him to drop it.' - Just relax. - No! Put it down. 'Tell him to put the gun down.' 'Please. I don't wanna do this. Put it down.' - 'Put the gun down.' - 'No. Drop it. Drop the gun.' - 'Just take it fucking easy.' - I'm counting to two. No, no, no, don't count. Don't start counting. One. You too. Hand me the gun nice and slow. Okay, Who's this? Who are you? You guys are gonna die, you know that, right? So enjoy your moment. You shut the fuck up! Jesus Christ. What did you say, you fat motherfucker. Okay, alright. Alright, Dave! Let's call the cops. Call the cops! Good. Call the cops. You could become witnesses against us. 'You can spend the rest of your life living in a hovel.' That's good, go ahead. Go ahead, Charo. 9-1-1. Something smells good. Do you smell that? 'It's good. What is that?' 'I don't know, man, but I'm hungry as all hell.' - It's like beef or something. - Phone down. 'Go sit down.' - Maury, come here. Come here! - 'What?' - Get the fuck over here. - 'What?' I'm right here, I'm right over here. I see a hole. - Are you insane? - You saw it. - I saw you see it. - I don't wanna die. You got something else? Because I've got nothing. Come on. You guys like meat? You mean to eat? Talking about the best money can buy. This is the gourmet stuff. 'Here's how I wanna do things.' I think you guys are good guys. Regular guys. - With a job to do. - With a job to do. Not only do we not have anything against you, frankly 'I gotta tell you, we admire your..' Professionalism. So, so they knocked off Tony, so what? Tony, he was a prick. I knew him for 20 minutes and he was annoying me. 'He's very disrespectful.' If I had any balls, I would've shot him myself. The only thing we owe to you for that is gratitude. Big time. Thank you both. You're welcome. Appreciate it. Alright. Well, how are we gonna do this, then? I don't know. - I was thinking that-- - No, please. - Shut your cakehole, please. - Christ. Just keep quiet. Do you guys... have any reason to kill us? We got any reason? No, I don't, no. We got no reason to kill you. That's nice. I mean, we have something in common, right? 'Right.' I'm Maurice. My name is Bobby. Bobby? Good. - Bobby, this is Dave. - 'How you doing, man?' - Nice to see you. - And Dave.. - I didn't.. - Irv. Irving. - Irving. - Yes. It's unbelievable. His father's name's Irving. - No shit. - He passed away recently. I miss hearing his name. Thank you for keeping it alive. Sure. And, you know, my wife, my ex-wife she lives on Irving Boulevard. She got the house. It's a small world. It is, how it all ties in. We're all, we're all in it. I got a great respect for you, Bobby. I would like...very much just to give you your gun back. Well, Maurice, I would very much like that...too. Would you pledge to me 'man to man' that we can just sit down and eat together as friends? We'll show you how you can eat like kings and then we'll all go our separate ways. Yeah, I think we could do that. - Yeah, I don't see.. - Is that a promise? - Absolutely. - Yeah. A pledge...of honor? Honor is very important. Sinatra said that it's everything. It's everything a man's worth, honor. I think the honor system, when instilled correctly is...a good system. So...let's do it that way, strictly with honor. Thank you for doing this. You're a good pro. Appreciate it. Sorry about the fat thing. Just going through a lotta shit right now. Yeah, it's-it's okay. Well, you wanna eat? Can we eat? Coming right up. Wait. Hold on, just for one second. Just please be quiet for one second. Hey. 'Is it done?' 'Yep.' - 'How's Suzy? Okay?' - She's fine. - 'Put her on.' - Wants to know if you're okay. Hi, honey, I'm great. I told you it was gonna be easy. 'Do what the guys tell you to do.' 'Because if you don't stay healthy, they don't get paid.' - 'Now, I'll see you later.' - Okay. Tell him how you fucked up. Tell him about Maury and the doctor. - Hello? - 'Are you bullshitting me?' - No, it's-it's fine. - Who's Maury and the doctor? It's just two guys that came out of the woodwork. 'Everything is under control.' - Yeah, well, get rid of them. - I can't do that now, Boris. - 'Why not?' - I made a promise. I don't care. I don't want any loose ends here. Understand? Okay, everything is under control. You're not done. I need you here. 'Goldbluth's having the party for his kid.' He's open, he's exposed, it's getting late. 'Clean yourself up and get over here.' - What do you mean "clean?" - Put on a tie. It's a party. Okay, it's just my...Boris. He said that we gotta take 'em out. - No! Stop! - We gotta take them out! - Come on, no! Come on, man! - We went through this. - Be quiet. Shut up. - We got a promise together. We're not doing it now. We're gonna work out a deal. Shut up. - Hey, we have a thing. - No, we don't. Every time I break a deal my life gets better so sit the fuck down. And shut up. Big mouth. We'll just walk away. You'll never see us again. - Let us go right now. - Okay, works for me. - We're not gonna say anything. - Your mother's name is what? That sucks. 'Suzanne, go to Loridonna's house.' Yeah, I am. Because you and Tony had a fight. - Like an alibi. - That's right. One, you and Tony had a fight. 'Two, you were at Lori's house all day.' And three, you have no idea where Tony is. - It's one, two, three. - Button my shoe. Jesus. Suzy, where's Tony? I don't know. What are you gonna do with these guys? Don't worry about them. They're not going anywhere. - 'Do you think they're gone?' - 'I don't hear anything.' 'Alright, let's try. Move over'' 'Tuck! Tuck in! Tuck in!' - 'That's all I got.' - 'Tuck in! Tuck in!' - 'Alright.' - Kick that son of a bitch. - 'Kick out.' - 'It's out! It's out.' - Go, just go. - Alright, push me. Push. Alright, I'm out. Come on, gimme your hands. I'll pull you out. Ready, one, two.. Fuck! This ain't happening, man. - Go back in. I'll come around. - Fuck me. I'm... I'm stuck in both directions. Stuck. Alright, hold on. I'll go around. Just relax, relax. - Get me out. - 'I know. Shut up.' - 'Maury, I don't like this.' - I know, I know. 'What are you doing?' I think I threw up a little. 'I'm comin' around.' 'Maury, you can't leave me in here! Maury!' Aw, shit, I gotta find something. I'll be right back. - 'Get me out first.' - I'll be right back. 'Maury, don't leave me alone.' 'I feel alone, Maury. Am I?' 'Mr. Goldbluth has given us a beautiful celebration.' 'With a bounty of food, that is, as always' an exquisite experience. And I say, on the occasion of Jerry becoming a man. Thank you, Cookie Goldbluth. Thank you for your generosity, your hospitality 'and your good taste.' You said that exactly the way I told you to. Well...now let us give thanks to God. 'Who brought us all together today.' 'As a boy becomes a man, in his eyes.' 'And a son becomes a man in the eyes of his father.' 'It's been said that a boy becomes a man' 'when a man is needed.' 'But when is he needed?' 'During our service this morning' 'Jerry read about a people' who, fleeing a mighty army 'were faced with the prospect of climbing' 'an impossible mountain.' And God spoke. And he said "Make an alliance with me. To climb this mountain half way." When those who survived made it as far as they could. 'The hand of God reached down from the heavens' 'and lifted them to the top.' Yeah! I saw him, Dave. He was very beautiful. Yeah? Who'd that be? Goldbluth. Perfect prospect, our guy. Let's get the fuck outta here, man. We had enough fun for one day, don't you think? People in there wanna kill us. And him, they're puttin' a hit on Goldbluth. Come on, let's go. Ma-Maury, stop, okay? There's psychotic motherfuckers in there trying to end our lives. Be happy you're not dead. Something brought us to this moment. To Goldbluth. It's so clear, Davey. Today was no accident. Everything led us here. This idea we have, of the perfect prospect. We made it up. It's a fantasy. Yeah, but I now know what we were talking about. It's like we were saying, if somebody is up there then He should create a guy like this for us. And He did. Everybody's always saying they think they saw God. "It's like I saw God." But there's a big difference from that when you really see him. What did you see? I told you. Let's go. Wow, he is beautiful. 'Look..' Leon. What the hell's he doin' here?' Brought, like us. Shit, come on. Let's go around. 'Bobby, what year is the Caddie?' 'What is it, Irv?' It's an '89. - '89, hope it's a big boy.' - Yeah. Yeah, it's a nice car. Whoa. Excuse me. You know, I don't work for free, Boris. This isn't my hobby, you know what I mean? If you want people walking around saying "Boris this" and "Boris that", you know, you gotta make an offer. - For money. - Hey, hey, hey. We'll take both these cocksuckers out, Frankie. Just relax and let me work out the details? We're gonna do 2 for 1. Yeah, I'll decide what they're worth. Alright, alright, alright. - 'What did you do?' - 'I didn't do anything!' You're supposed to be taped. - You saw me tape them up. - I told you guys... 'No messy, now find these assholes.' Then you come back for Goldbluth. I'm at the bar. How come every time someone's fucking up it's my fault? Alright, we gotta talk fast. You gotta close hard. Fast and hard. Hey, how ya doin'? - Leon! - Hey! You guys! Hey, look, who is that? You remember? That your lovely lady friend, Karen. Used to be. Now, she is my lovely fiancee, Karen. - 'Hey, good for you.' - Congratulations. 'No, next dance, honey, next one.' Are you a friend of the Goldbluths? I'm Jerry's piano teacher, you? We have a common friend who wants us to expose Mr. Goldbluth to our high end. Yeah, there's the man you should talk to about fine foods. Come on, I'll introduce you. These guys, for a living, they're meat salesmen? Yeah. They knock on peoples door and say "Do you wanna buy a fuckin' cheeseburger?" That's a living? That's a life? Mr. Goldbluth, listen, I-I want you to meet some people, here. Gentlemen. This is, Dave and-- - Maury, Maury. - Maury. Dave and Maury. - Hi. - How are you? Beautiful party. Tony said you have a great appreciation for good tastes. - He said we should connect. - Yeah, where is Tony? He'll be here. He speaks very highly of you. Said you taught him everything he knew about barbecue. Yeah, well. What the hell does he know? See ya. No, really, he says you're a real magician, you know? We supply gourmet clients with the finest beef in the world. We think you should have the best. - Ha-ha. Is that right? - Mr. Goldbluth, sir? Yeah? I already got the best. You see, I get it from Omaha. So you guys have a good time, anyway, okay? Hey, champ. Gentlemen. ♪ The time has come ♪ ♪ Turn down the light ♪ 'You guys are almost the same age.' 'Cindy, meet my son, Jerry.' Hey, Jerry, nice to meet you. What the hell's going on here? Could you excuse us real quick? Dad, come here. 'Do you think I'm ready?' Ha ha. Are you kiddin'? You're gonna love it. Jesus. When I was you age I would've given my right arm for this set up like this. My first time, I was ten. I mean, you're like old already. Alright, look, you wait here I'm gonna check the front. 'They'll kill him when they get back.' We gotta sell him now, bring them in. Harold, what is go-- What is going on? Where's Jerry? - In the car. - In the ca.. Faye, Faye, Faye, come here. What's the matter with you? The girl does parties, you know, graduations birthday parties? 'Harry.' Wish I had a camera. This could like a happiness poster. The one they-they sell in the gift shops. Thanks. You hear that? It's obvious. I'm getting rid of that girl. Let him just have a hand job. Just...one time? One time.. There, see. Have another drink. Who is tha.. Wow, you really keep her off balance keeps the flame alive, Mr. Goldbluth? Cookie. Call me Cookie. Let me ask you something, when you do your grilling you like your steaks cut an inch or an inch and a half thick? What, are you putting me on? Two inches. 'These guys are gone, they're long gone.' You know what? I'm done. I wanna go get Goldbluth. And we'll call it a night. I'm talking about the best. 40 day, dry aged, prime Kobe-Angus hybrid. Superior animals. - The best? - On Earth...on Mars, I dunno. I've never eaten there. Hey, Maury. But anything, say, within two, three million miles 'of Sherman Oaks, this is five star stuff.' - 'Get the book.' - What's the book? 'The one monthly amount includes everything' the filets, the T-bone, the New York cuts the London broil and the magnificent rib eye. All at a fraction of the price you're spending now flying in who knows what from Omaha. - Excuse me? - Let me show you something. I don't wanna get into he-said-she-said but this steer had problems late in life. In all probability. Are you saying this is bad meat? This is prime beef. This is choice labeled as prime. We see this all the time. No attention to quality. Mr. Goldbluth...we can take you to the top of the beef world. The highest altitude in gourmet dining. Meat so soft, people don't even bother to use their teeth. The meat just seems to melt as it makes contact with your mouth. Yeah. You hear that? You don't even have to chew it. I like it. It was packed full of meat like that. It looked like a giant gift basket. Make a-a nice gift for the uncles. - That's a lovely gesture. - Yeah.. You know what? I'm strangely attracted to the misty yellow color. There's nothing strange about that. 'Open the door!' - Another door. - Again, you motherfucker. Fuck you, I ain't doing that again. 'Let's go around this way.' Seven freezers, seven uncles. I'm just gonna need to get a little credit information nothing to worry about. - Boris. - Nothing? - How screwed are we now? - Just a little bit. But we've got everything under control, we chased them inside. - They're hiding in the kitchen. - Good. Now find Goldbluth and get him in there too because this is gonna be a goodbye package. We'll just bang him with the other two. 'Two red, two blue and...right now.' Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna need you to sign right here. - Here, here and here. - That's a lotta places. Take it. This is the best, right? See, it's a matter of personal preference. - Davey! - There's only one best. 'That's what always pissed me off about "the best." 'I mean what is best?' Is it best for me or is it what's best for you? You guys lied. - You swore on Sinatra. - Hey. 'Go! Get him! Go, go, go!' 'Watch out.' 'Move! Move! Go!' God damn it! 'Tear this fucking door down.' It's preference. It's selling. It's selling. 'And knowing what to buy, who to buy it from.' For all I know, you two guys could be shysters who are trying to scam the wrong motherfucker. But you seem okay. ♪ h-h, yeah ♪ ♪ h-h, yeah ♪ Mr. Goldbluth. There's people in that party that want to kill you. There's a reason why Tony isn't here. Talk fast. - Get outta here. - We're movin' out. - Come on, Mr. Goldbluth. - Come on, move it, move it. - Ralph. - Yeah, boss. - 21 grand. - You got it. Alright, fellas. For your gifts. Mr. Goldbluth.. ...it was your friend, Tony's. I'll be expecting some freezers in the next 10 days. They're on their way. Yeah, I want that joint cleaned up like it never happened. Never happened. Dad! Dad, you okay? I'm always okay. We were just celebrating. 'Dick.' You look tired, how you doing? Jesus, by now I was expecting a postcard from Ensenada. - You get anything? - We got anything? I don't know, let's check. These count? You know, why don't you get Dick's opinion? 'Three, what do you think of that?' Before you answer, how about four? Of course, five is a number that everybody is comfortable with. Probably the hand, somethin' to do with that. - You wrote five? - No. Six. Of course if I told you six, I'd be lying. - 'Cause he's forgetting seven. - Seven. What the hell is this? Seven. We wrote some paper...seven. You want me to spike seven boxes? No, no, on this one be leisurely 'cause this is gold. We got cash. 21 grand. 'Minus our commission.' What is this? There you go. Come on, honey, jump on. 'Mom, look what Daddy got me.' - That's it, honey. - Come on, come on. Ready? - Yes, I am. - We're gonna go up high. Ain't she beautiful? 'Maury, don't burn my chicken.' You're burning the chicken, you idiot. Here's what we do... some of this.
