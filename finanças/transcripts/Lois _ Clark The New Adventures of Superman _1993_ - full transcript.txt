Wanda? Are you all right? Jeez, I just had the craziest dream. Well, tell me about it, my darling. Oh, I hate when people tell me their dreams. At least I think I do. Funny, I don't remember anybody ever telling me their dreams. How can I hate it? Oh, you're tired. We both are. These last few days have been a nightmare. Hunted. Hiding like rats. But all that's about to change. I have a plan... ...that will free us forever from Clark and his evil factotum, Superman. Kent, why is this happening to us? We're simply too good for this world. Anything? -Are you hungry? -No. -You need to rest. -I can't believe I let her go. -Just let her drive off with him. -Honey. -I'm an idiot. -Clark, what were you gonna do? She said she didn't love you. She didn't wanna see you. It had to be a trick, Dad. She cannot love him. -This won't do any good. -I let my feelings cloud my judgment. -I've looked everywhere and I can't find-- -Superman. I'm speaking on an ultra frequency only you can hear. -What is it? -Luthor. I imagine you 'd like to see me. Well, that you shall. The corner of Curvey and Storaco. Don't. Give me one good reason. How about 1 5? Explosives, wired to office buildings, museums. Two or three of those ubiquitous 20-something coffee hangouts. Now tell me, what is the appeal of those places? Where's Lois? Look, but don't touch, or boom. Good to be at it again, huh? Now tell me. Be honest. Isn't one of us without the other incomplete, unnecessary? Am I alone here? I hope not, because there's nothing more painful than unrequited hate. Luthor, when this is over, I will personally build your next prison. And I will seal the lock. Well, I wish I were taking challenges tonight, but this meeting is about love. If you call what you're doing to Lois "love"... ...you are sicker than I ever imagined. You think that I don't love her? That I'm what, incapable? Too consumed with evil to feel? What a simple world you live in. All the powers that fate gave you... ...how little do you understand an ordinary man's heart... ...and the lengths it will drive him to. T ake her from me, and I will unleash all the forces of hell on this city. -Do that, and this is war. -Well, then. This is war! + While that building was exploding, someone was trying to kidnap the clone... -...on her way back from the N.I.A. Iab. -One guess. Lex Luthor. We don't know. Leonard was the only one close enough to get a look, but he-- But my glasses got knocked off. Fortunately, the clone... ...fought him off, if you can imagine. Hello? I think I said I wanna see.... Clark. -Hi. -Hi. You got my message finally? I really need to talk to you... ...alone, subtle hint. I'll go dissect something. So how you been? Good, I guess. You? You know. This gross you out? I'm sorry. I just think I need the vitamins. Look, I'm sorry about what happened last night. Was it Luthor? Well, I didn't really get a good look, but, yeah, I think it was him. Why would he wanna kidnap you? -Well, I can get to something he needs. -What? -See, I think it's a way to get him. -But what is it, specifically? Clark, I've got this whole speech memorized... ...so it would just be nice if I could sort of go in order. Sure. Thanks. Well, I'm really, really, really sorry that I tried to kill Lois. I know that that was just totally wrong. But I'm only nine days old, and l don't think I deserve to be locked up. -It's really unfair. -Can we just get to the point, here? What do you know about Luthor that could help me get Lois back? Okay. Speech. This thing that Lex wants, I know where it is. And I'm one of only two people who can get it. -What is it? -Well, I'll tell you... -...on our walk. -What walk? The walk we're gonna take. -Yes. -The clone is gone. Of course she is. Clark Kent checked her out. Yes. How did you know that? Because I'm not an obsequious snitch, bungling the plans of my superiors. After our failed attempt to get her, for which I blame you entirely, by the way... ...it was obvious that she'd fall into enemy hands. Fortunately, I have a second scenario. T onight, be certain that the two canisters of which we spoke... ...are in the main lab vault, and that the vault is open. -Can you do that? -Y es. If you can't, my boy, I suggest you run, hide and pray. -So, Kent? -My pet? Do you have a plan where we could breathe real air and see the sun again? Not that this isn't a real wonder palace... ...great for keeping the skin moist, and growing mushrooms. Yes, I have a plan. If it works we'll not only walk free again, but outlive every one of our pursuers. And the best thing of all, Wanda, we'll be together. Wanda.... It sounded odd, your calling me that. Wanda Detroit. How come there's so much about me that I don't know? Where I'm from? Who my parents are? I gotta admit, it really scares me, like being in the dark. That bump on the head has got you a little foggy, that's all. What's a name? I mean, for that matter, what's a past? Can you touch it? Can you feel it? Can you love it? Who we are, how we feel right here, right now. That's everything, isn't it? I guess. -Y eah, sure. -All right, then. Now, let me show you the plan. Lex has money, like $200 million in these-- What do you call them? -Not stocks. Bears-- -Bearer bonds. Right. Y eah. So they're in this bank, and only Lois Lane can get them out. I was supposed to, but I refused. But I was thinking, Lex wanted that money pretty bad. It doesn't seem like he's rolling in it. He can't use the real Lois because everybody's looking for her, right? -Right. -And trust me... ...it takes like half an hour to sign all those forms. And if he did use the real Lois, you'd be there. You gotta figure Lex has guys in the bank watching to make sure I don't get it. -But what if I do, and the guys call Lex? -That would flush him out. -And you'd snag him. Pretty cool, huh? -Not bad. -I'm helping you, aren't l? -Yeah. Yeah, you are. -Does that mean you love me? -What? Well, I think I love you. See, I was reading about it in this magazine. How love is helping each other and-- Well, you're helping me to get out, and I'm helping you to get Lex and-- Well, I gotta admit. You sort of grow on a person. So I think I love you. Do you love me? Don't take this the wrong way. But, no. Well... ...is it okay if I love you? Sure. Yes. Just don't kill anybody over it, okay? Oh, my God, that was two days ago. You have got to learn to let things go. I'm working on it. -You ready? -I don't know about this, Kent. Breaking the law. Doesn't that make us just as bad as that no-good hunk of dirt, Clark? Of course not. He does it out of desperation. He's too stupid to make a living, so he resorts to petty theft. Pathetic, really. But you and l, we're falsely accused. We're relentlessly hunted. I mean, what other methods are left for us? -lt still doesn't feel right. -Well, maybe it will, once you've done it. Hey, boys. I'm flat. Either of you good with your hands? Open the door. We don't have a lot of time. If you're having a crisis of conscience, have it somewhere else. Well? -It's kind of exciting. -Welcome to a whole new world. + Here we have the labors of one Dr. Mamba. -Who? -A scientist who worked for me. A genius in the field of genetics and cellular research. But his genius was co-opted by Clark. It was Clark who got the good doctor to create the clone that's trying to kill you. -Oh, her. -Still. The doctor may have gone wrong... ...but what he achieved is the key to our freedom. And $200 million, because, when free, it's always best to be well-off. Well, avoiding the cops is also right up there on my list. So, what do you say? Let's scram. Beautifully put, my dear. Dr. Klein. Dr. Klein, I heard the lab got robbed. Oh, Clark, the lab was robbed last night. Yeah. Right. What was taken? Two clone fetuses created by Dr. Mamba. One male. One female. -I have a feeling the thief was-- -Luthor. No. Luthor. Dr. Klein, maybe you ought to sit down for a minute. -You know, actually, I think I'll sit. -Yeah. C.K., here are those bank diagrams you wanted. Oh, and it's not exactly legal to possess these. Hi, officer. -Thanks, Jimmy. -Any word on Lois? No. Nothing. Out of her head. Kidnapped by Lex Luthor. You married to a clone. Man, if it ain't one thing with you guys, it's another. Wanda? We have a visitor. Meet Asabi. -Good evening. -Hi. Asabi used to work for me years ago, trying to teach me... ...the mystic ways of the T agi cult, but... ...I rejected his teachings. I was in love with all things scientific, and what a fool. Because now I know that science is only the key that opens the prison door. -Whereas the power of spirit-- -ls the freedom... ...to never again be trapped in any prison. I speak of your soul. What is it, do you think? My soul? You know, who I am? Which I'm a little fuzzy on, to be honest. The soul is the water. The glass is your body. With you so far. The soul is only trapped within the glass... ...until one learns the very simple trick of.... All right, my darling, do you know the Greek definition of seconds? Nick, give me another souvlaki. No, no, no. The seconds on a clock. -No. -Each is an arrow. The last one fatal. But not for us. Our final seconds will be the first step to life everlasting. The clone fetuses we took from the lab. Their growth accelerated. -Their bodies almost ready. -Almost ready? For what? We are sought by a man with great powers, with x-ray vision. Now, how do you hide from such a man? You don't, unless you exchange one body for another. I'm not gonna shuck my body like a piece of corn. I got enough problems. I'm not doing it. Nothing personal, Mister Asabi, but this is nuts. All right. Then let me tell you our future. We run. We hide. We're caught. We're caged, and die alone. Let me tell you something else. If that's what you wish, I'll make it so. I'll give up my freedom, my future, my life for you. -Oh, Kent. -But know this. That we stand on the very precipice of all our tomorrows. And if you just close your eyes and make the leap, we shall know eternity. T ogether. You really think this guy can do magic? Look. Well... ...I never pictured myself as a blond, but... ...what the hell. My life can't be any crazier than it already is. Now that's my girl. Now, get some rest. We have a big day tomorrow. I see into her mind, her heart, a great love. One that transcends time. Even now, she longs for him in her dreams. -And if I kill him? -The love would not die. -The memories would surface. -Help me, Asabi. I cannot lose her. There is but one way to sever this love, and bind her to you forever. She must kill this man with her own two hands, of her own free will. That done, the love will die, and she will be yours. -Yes? -Mr. Luthor? -Hello, Phillip. -Well, she's here... ...making a withdrawal, just as you predicted, sir. Should take half an hour. Thank you. Expect your payment by the end of the week. Why, thank you, sir. Time for phase two. -This plan is totally excellent. -Yeah. Except no Lex. Well, I've been thinking again. Would it be the worst thing in the world if you never saw Lois again? -What? -Well, just keep an open mind, okay? I look like her, and I can sound like her. And everybody thinks that I am her. And I learn real fast. And if you give me a month, I'll be her. And I have $200 million, so... ...you have to admit, the whole package, it doesn't totally suck. No. No. No, it doesn't. Look, I'm sure you mean well. But I love Lois. Who she is... ...everything she's been, done, dreamed, thought. Every second of her life up to now, and you can't just make that. -Hey, hey, wait. -I'm never gonna have anyone. -No, look, I'm sorry-- -I'm just a freak. I don't have a past or a life. I bet I don't even have a soul. -There's nothing for anybody to love. -That's not true. You're just different. Different is good, okay? I ought to know. You just need to get your own life. And you will. -Really? -Really. Will you help me? Maybe meet somebody nice like you? Sure. You think he'll be able to fly? Well-- Clark, long time no see. Superman, another building is exploding in 1 5 seconds... -...and the real Lois is in that building. -Help, Superman. You now have 1 0 seconds to save her. I'd better get back to my detonator in three minutes or another building goes. Then another and another. Tick-tock, Clark. Superman, help. Superman. Well done, Man of Steel. Of course, there were no real explosives here. Much as I can count on your behavior when she 's in danger... ...I'd never leave her life in anyone 's hands but my own. I love her too much and she loves me. Says there 's never really been anyone else. You might pass that on to your friend Clark. You' re probably wondering why I didn't snuff out your miserable life up there. I wanted to tell you something... ...answer a few questions about your place in the world. -That's really nice of you. -Y es. Considering what a graceless little traitor you are. You see, Dr. Mamba designed two classes of clones. An A class, with a life span of about... ...hundred years, and a B class with a life span of two weeks. Now you, my dear, are very much a B class. -What? -What are you now? About 1 0, 1 2 days? With a life span of two weeks, I wouldn't be making any holiday plans. -No. -You will be quite dead by Friday. But, Lex, Lex, you could fix me... ...couldn't you? I had you made. I could have you remade. Because I'd do anything for you, you know that. Do l? What if I could give you something that you wanted? And what could you possibly give me? Superman? You hate him, right? Well, he's really someone else. Someone else that you hate. They're the same person. -What are you prattling on about? -Superman. He's really Clark Kent. -My God. -I did good, right? I was good? I'm very impressed. This information could not have come at a better time. And how deeply wonderful that... ...that which I brought into being could teach me something. Now, let me give you a little lesson. Never trust anyone. There's no reversing your life span. You will die in two days. A soulless, paper-thin copy, unloved in life, unmourned in death... ...and forgotten faster than you ever lived. Have a nice week. Lex? Lex, please don't leave me. + He didn't hurt you, did he? Did he say anything about Lois? Or did he take you to his hideout? -I'll talk to her. -Good luck. Come on. Why don't we take a walk, clear out your head. Yeah. -Lois? -Don't call me that. That's your name, isn't it? I don't have a name. I'm not even supposed to be alive. Guess it's a good thing I'll be dead in two days. Oh, no. Just here long enough to see everything I'll never have. I just wanna know why? Can you tell me that? I don't know. But I do know that who you are... ...doesn't have anything to do with how long you're here. It has to do with who you touch, and how. And Clark really cares for you. You've been a friend to him. He can trust you. You see, I can't even do that right. -Lex Luthor? -Yes? -Are you alone? -I am. -Have you the item? -ltem present. -Oh, my God, it's gone. -No, it's not. -lf you removed your sunglasses. -That'd be non sat. -Non sat? -Non satisfactory. Can we get down to business, please. This is the A-tech quantum disrupter. -The most deadly weapon on earth. -Really? Capable of long-range target annihilation at the molecular level. -That's one way to take out the trash. -This is no toy, mister. You're looking at nine years of top secret government research. The results of which might even kill Superman. Why, then by all means, I'll take it. -Haven't you forgotten something? -Forgotten something? Like I'm betraying my oath, my country and my brethren... ...by turning over this awesomely destructive force to a psychopath? That I'll be haunted the rest of my life for ever agreeing to this satanic bargain? -Forgotten that, do you mean? -No. Your money. T omorrow, you will inhale the smoke of the sacred flame. It takes all that you are. All that you shall ever be, exactly. And at that moment... ...your new bodies will inhale the smoke, and then.... -That's it? -Yes. Just like that, boom, I'm a blond? It's harder dyeing your roots. Soon we shall be free to start any lives we dare dream. Now, what would you like to be? European countess. South American horsewoman. No, wait, I've got it. A Russian poet. A writer. A writer? When you said poet, l-- Yeah, a writer. It's crazy. I can barely talk. Who am I to think I could be a writer? You have more locked inside you than you could ever dream. Believe me. I just wish I didn't have this weird feeling. I mean, I know what we're doing is the right thing to get us out of this corner. It's just something. Something's eating at me, like being in the dark, and... ...wanting to turn on the switch. And it makes you nuts, because you know it's there and you can't find it. Well... ...we'll find it together. But first, I've got to run a little errand. And I won't be long. She's emerging from her darkness, struggling ever closer to her truth. -The love she longs for. -No. Yes, I know. But that love will be severed. I'm gonna lure him here tonight, and she is going to kill him. -Hi. -Hi. Your mom told you? Yeah. I'm really sorry. We should get you over to STAR Labs. -I'm sure there's something-- -I don't have much time left, and l... ...don't wanna spend it getting stuck with needles. Your mom's a great person. I can see why you turned out the way you did. She understands so much... ...and I believe her when she says that... ...you care about me. I don't like to see anyone in trouble. I wanna help. Well, I don't think you will when... ...you find out what happened. I did something bad. I wanted Lex to help me to live longer... ...and so I told him that-- I told him that you were Superman. -It's okay if you hate me. -No. -I already hate myself. -You were scared. -You made a mistake. It's all right. -I'm so ashamed. But I'll help you to find Lois, and I'll help you to catch Lex. I hate Luthor. I hate him for making me. Now, is that any way to talk about your creator? -Some would call it blasphemy. -Stand back. Yes, do. That way you'll have a better view. Clark. Jonathan and Martha Kent, we haven't met. Lex Luthor. -What did you do to my son? -The same thing I'll do for you. Clark, all the years we've known each other, you've been keeping a little secret. Now, is that any way to treat your best enemy? How long I feared you, envied you, yet never really knew you. So I wonder, can you beg... ...for your life? No? T oo un-Superman. I understand. So, what about for the life of your parents? You'll beg for that, won't you? Please, don't kill them. Come on. I beg you. Nicely done. You grovel with style, and that's important. Because I'm gonna tell every criminal in the world who you really are. And as an added bonus, I'm gonna give them the design of this weapon... ...your parents' address, and you're gonna spend your life begging or hiding. And believe me, they're both equally humiliating. Well, I suppose that famous strength will be coming back soon... ...so I need a little getaway insurance. Now, let's see. -Eenie, meenie-- I prefer female company. -No. You let her go-- You two, you stay and help your fallen hero. -Dad, you okay? -Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Can...? I can't even stand up. Here, boy. Come on, come on. -Maybe we should call the police. -No. Too dangerous. You're the only chance I've got. Follow Luthor. Take the cell phone. Don't let him see you. Whenever he gets to where he's going, call me. Hopefully, my strength will return by then, okay? Hey. Be careful. + Is Lois here? Is she all right? She's fine. But thank you for asking. It occurs to me, Martha, that if I'd had a mother as loving as you... ...I might be a better person. Thank God I didn't. Wanda? -I had a close call with Superman. -Are you all right? Yes. Fine. Fortunately, I was able to defend myself. But he's incredibly strong. He's quite insane. He may find us at any moment. Well, I don't think I can shoot anybody. Oh, no, believe me. No one treasures life more than I do, but this man is evil. He works for Clark. He wants to destroy us. We must be able to defend ourselves with deadly force if necessary. Now, there. It's set on full force. You put your finger there on the trigger. You aim... ...and fire. -Clark? -Y eah. I followed him. He's somewhere beneath Fourth and Grand, but way deep. If you follow the tunnels of the old subway track. -My mom, is she okay? -She was the last time I saw her. You see, I kind of got lost. Well, not really lost, just a little. -I'm sure I'm gonna find her-- -Fourth and Grand under the old subway. Okay. I'll find it. You just sit tight. -I'm sorry. I'm still lost. -It's all right. You should head back up this way. I'll take it from here. -You don't look so good. -I'll be all right. It seems they're done a little early. Asabi, we're ready any time you are. Then come to me, and open your mind to the eternal. The soul is indestructible and ever transitive. Death is not to be feared. -All right, Luthor, it's over. -Superman. Luthor? Who's Luthor? -Get out of here, and leave us alone. -I don't think so. Where's my mom? Wanda, shoot him. Lois, don't. Shoot him now. Put him down. -Stay back. -Lois, it's me. -I'm not gonna tell you again. Get back. -I will when you put the gun down. Shoot him. Wanda, shoot him. I can't. -Oh, for God's sake. -I can't hold this, Luthor. The whole thing is gonna cave. We'll take our chances. No. Learn this now. My love, don't ever stand between me and what I want. No. Kent? Come on. I'm gonna get you out. I found your mom... ...down the tunnel, around the corner. I did good, didn't l? We gotta get out of here. No. -Let her go. -She stays with me. -She'll die. -We'll all die, then. Come on, Kent. I'll help. It's too late. You say you love her. You say she means everything to you, then let her live. Give her that. Or do you want me to beg again? And you said I couldn't love. How little you understood me. How little anyone ever did. Kent? Come on. Come on. We've gotta get out of here. -ls Lois all right? -I don't know. -I've gotta get her to a hospital. Are you? -Yes, yes. Go. Go. Go on. There's been repeated cranial trauma, a pretty bad concussion, shock... ...no evidence of hematoma, thank God, but-- Wanda? Lois? Yes? How you feeling? Fine, I guess. I'm sorry, do I know you? -Yeah. -What's your name? Clark. Clark? See you... ...Clark. See you, Lois.
