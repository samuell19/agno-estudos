(panting) Stop! You're supposed to stop for people who need help! (grunts) Uh-uh, not so fast, Barry Allen. Forget about them. You can't change other people. It's just a waste of energy. But... Barry, when I was a little girl, grandma taught me a prayer. Accept the things you cannot change. Have the courage to change the things you can and have the wisdom to know the difference. I don't totally get that. (chuckles) You will. Now, all we need is a phone. There's a gas station. - Barry: Race ya! - Barry! (crunching) Mom. (indistinct radio chatter) Priest: And we may never know exactly what happened. A break-in gone wrong. A disturbed mind. But we do know that this was a crime and a tragedy and as we commit Nora to the care of our lord, we know her son, Barry, will need all our prayers and help (fading) To see him though this terrible curse. Happy birthday, mom. I'm so sorry. I should've been there. What? If I just ran a little faster, I'd have been there. Barry, you were just a boy. There was nothing you could've done. We don't know that. If I'd been there, maybe I could've stopped it. I could've saved her. Come on. Stop doing this to yourself. What was that saying your mother had, about accepting the things you can't change? (beeping) Well, this is something I can change. A break-in at the Flash museum. - See you later? - You better. (whirring intensifies) - (grunts) - Well, Flash, once again, it looks like you're at the bottom and I'm the Top. (gasps) Flash: Mirror Master and Heat Wave. Going to a lot of trouble to steal my old junk, aren't you? (grunts) (groans) (groans) Exhibit's closed, Top. (gasps) (surprised exclaiming) (grunts) (straining) (both gasping) (strains) Captains Boomerang and Cold. The gang's all here. And I thought you forgot about us as soon as you sent us off to prison. So this little reunion is about revenge? Not really. Offing you is just a bonus part of the job. Job? Who hired you? No offense. None of you clowns are smart enough to pull this off. Zoom: You're quite right, of course, Flash. I knew using these morons would put you off your guard. Hey. They're motivated by greed. They lack the commitment. The absolute focus... - To kill me? - Erase you. I'm going to bring this shrine to your ego down on your head, along with 10 square blocks of Central City and everyone around. What? What are you talking about? We didn't bring any bombs. Oh, but I did. (beeping) (beeping) What is this? Something I attached to your belts as I made my entrance. (clamoring) I wouldn't unbuckle if I were you. You'll just set them off. You don't have to kill thousands of innocents to bring me down. No. No, I don't, but I choose to. Knowing it will make your last moments pure agony. - (beeping) - Goodbye. (whooshing) You can't escape, Flash. The adhesive will never completely liquefy, regardless of speed. I'm counting on that. (both grunt) (straining) Now, you got no choice, Thawne. Disarm the bombs or you blow up with us. Very well. If it means shattering your golden throne in history, linking your name forever to this city's darkest hour, then my life is a small price to pay. (glass shattering) I agree. Your lives aren't worth much. But Flash's life is. You called them. You've got your posse, I've got mine. Clearly you should never do this stuff without me. You end up with crap all over yourself. Focus, GL. Bombs? It's future tech. Difficult to disarm without setting them off, even for me. I could try to vaporize the bombs. Yes. But you'd be vaporizing the Rogues as well. Diana is right. What's plan B? (groans) How do we shut off these charges? You can't. We'll all be dead shortly. The truth hurts, doesn't it? Each of you take one of the Rogues as far from Central City as you can. We'll attempt to disarm the devices once sufficiently isolated. (grunts) I'm not going to just leave you here. Lantern, we're running out of time. Hal, go. I'd suck it in if I were you. (whimpers) (yells) (gasps) Aren't you gonna do something? I am. I've got a million microbes eating the bomb's wiring. Waiting is the worst part. (gasping) (groans) (grunts) (crunching) (bomb beeping) (beeping intensifies) (sighs) (beeping) (sighs) You may have minimized the destruction but the final bomb will still turn this monument to your ego into your own tomb. What are you doing? You can't escape. You can't reach the bomb to disarm it. You're going to die. You may have my powers, Thawne, but you have almost zero imagination about using them. (circuits crackling) Looks like 25th century technology is pretty delicate. I've notified STAR Labs to ready a cozy little cell for you, professor. I understand the food's not great there, Zoom. Enjoy your petty little Victories, Flash. But no matter how fast you run, you can't save everyone. Not the ones that matter to you. Best to keep your mouth shut, if you don't want bugs in your teeth Thawne's a classic sociopath. They have a knack for knowing just what will get under your skin. Yeah, they do. You okay? Don't worry about me Bats, I'm fine. Nothing I can't run off. (phone rings) (groans) James: Look who's just joined the land of the living. I don't mean to interrupt your beauty sleep, lord knows you'll need it, but the Elongated Kid murderer isn't going to catch himself. Elongated Man was murdered? Elongated Kid. What? Director Singh wants us pulling all-nighters until we close this case. Hey, what's going on? We interrupt our programming to bring you this breaking news. We're live outside the cold museum, where Citizen Cold is battling Captain Boomerang. Reportedly the confrontation began inside the museum moments ago. Cold is on the loose already? Do we really have to learn this stuff on TV? Doesn't anyone call the cops anymore? Looks like a power struggle in the Rogues. Who are the "Rogues"? The Rogues! Flash's worst enemies bent on Flash's destruction so they can take over Central City. Okay. We'll continue this hilarious leg-pulling later. - After the Flash has taken care of Citizen Cold. - (gasps) - Huh? (Grunts) - (all gasping) (groans) Barry, are you all right? Mom? Mom. Oh, that was a nasty spill, even for you. Let me see your head. I'm fine. Mom! It's you, you're here. (chuckles) Well, of course I'm here. You promised me you'd take me to dinner on my birthday. It's my birthday. The end of the world can't stop that. You forgot. (chuckles) It's okay, Barry. It's easy for a busy young man to forget his old mom. Huh? I could never forget you. (chuckles) Oh, my. Barry, what's gotten into you? Are you all right? People have been acting so strangely with this terrible war hanging over their heads. War? What? No, mom, I'm fine, but everything else has changed and I have to find out why. I think it probably has something to do with me being... - Gay. - What? No. It's okay. I love you no matter what. Mom, it's not that, it's something else. Brace yourself for a shock. I'm the Flash. Oh. What's the Flash? You know, the Flash. Fastest man alive, fights crime, very famous superhero. Superhero? (snickers) You mean like Batman? (groans) (both grunting) (straining) (groans) (panting) Where's the Joker? (groaning) Where Yo-yo? Tell me where the Joker's funhouse is this time, while you can still talk. Oh, it's on the tip of my tongue. (groans) Let me help you get it off. (gasps) Judge Dent was kidnapped last night, where did the Joker take him? (gasps) Even if I did know, it wouldn't do you any good, Bats. He's probably already dead. Then so are you. (gasps) (screams) Cyborg? I surrender to you. Smart. Batman. You should have let her hit the pavement. - You shouldn't have thrown her. - She slipped. Aren't you wondering how I found you? Thermal vision, cybernetic hearing and total access to every camera on the grid. Must be a nice perk for being in the president's back pocket. I've told you, it's not like that. As national security adviser I can help more people. Like that murdering psychopath? Maybe you should go "help" people in some other town. We're trying to help all the people, while there's still a world left. We need you. "We"? Hologram party? Ingenious. Saves a fortune on snacks. Enchantress, Pied piper, Citizen Cold, Shade, Sandman, the Shazam kids. It's Batman. Seriously, Batman. Well, he's older than I thought. But I'm not hard of hearing. You know why we're here Batman. War. Over 100 million people died when Atlantis sank Western Europe into the ocean. Another 32 million slaughtered when the Amazons invaded the United Kingdom and renamed it New Themyscira. We have to take down Aquaman and Wonder Woman before their war destroys what's left of the world. We can do it. That's exactly what Captain Atom said before he flew over there and vanished. He went in without a plan or backup. If we want to win this thing, we need the best tactician on the planet. You. You can't just turn your back on this, Batman. Not when we've got a chance to stop this war and save the world. War's over, soldier. You just don't know it yet. Everybody lost. Can I help you, sir? Sir? Doris, it's me. (iris laughing) No, I don't need help. Everything is fine now. Mommy! How is my little angel? Awesome. Daddy took me out to lunch and we had chicken wings and I told him about the invasion drill we had at our school today. (honking) (banging) (grunts) Bruce? Alfred? (bats screeching) What happened to you, Bruce? You are the James bond of superheroes. What turned you into the unabomber? (grunts) Who are you? I said, who the hell are you? (groans) Bruce, wait. You have to remember. It's me. It's Barry, Barry Allen. - Bruce. - Bruce? - Bruce. - Bruce is dead. I watched him die. My god. He's the one who died that night in the alley. Bruce died and you lived. You're his father. You're Thomas Wayne. (gunfire) Man: Pilgrim to mayflower, do you copy? Where the hell are you? I'm at the rendezvous point. There's no sign of the package or any other members of the resistance. And I'm up to my neck in Amazons. (shrieks) (grunts) You're an American. But you are going to tell me a little more about yourself. Who are you? No. (Grunts) Amazon: He's resisting the lasso of truth. How is that possible, queen Diana? It's not. (chokes) Who are you? And what are you doing in New Themyscira? (groans) My name is colonel Steve Trevor of the United States special forces. I'm here to retrieve Lois Lane. Who is Lois Lane? Lois Lane is a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist who's been embedded in New Themyscira for three months, gathering intel on your Amazons for Cyborg. She's also one of the most beautiful women I've ever met. Until now, you mean. Amazon: Our information was correct. Cyborg is amassing the outside world's superhumans in an attempt to interfere with our war. He will fail. Now, find me this Lois Lane. Yes, my queen. May I deal with the prisoner for you? No. The queen of the Amazons is a servant to her people. (groans) (choking) Nothing is beneath her. (gasping) (groans) I told you. Everything changed. You have nine more fingers. I suggest you tell me how you found out about me. In my world, I'm a hero, named the Flash. Bruce took me here. Showed me... - (cracking) - (screams) I used to be a doctor. Mention my dead son again and I will break out my surgical instruments. (groans) My ring. Let me show you that I'm telling the truth. My uniform is in that ring. I'll humor you. See. I told... Batman: Not what you were expecting? No. Thawne. Who? The man this uniform belongs to. My opposite. The reverse-Flash. Eobard Thawne. What kind of name is Eobard? The 25th century kind. He replicated the accident that allowed me to tap into the speed force. Became a criminal. Professor Zoom. Speed force? The speed force allows both of us to bend the laws of physics using super speed. He can travel through time. You're suggesting that he changed something in the past? That changed everything. It's crazy. My mom's alive. You're Batman. And Diana and Arthur are about to start World War III. But why give me this? He hates you so much he'll destroy everything to kill you. But his psychosis requires that you know he's responsible. Could anyone, even Thawne, be that deranged? You'd be amazed the monsters this world can create. We have to stop this, Dr. Wayne. Catch Thawne, find out what he changed and change it back before Aquaman and Wonder Woman kill everyone on the planet. Not saying I believe you, but, in your reality, is my son... Bruce is alive. He's Batman. If I were to help you, what exactly would we need? Just what's over there and unbelievably bad weather. (Thunder crashes) Welcome to Gotham. Deathstroke: I thought you were supposed to be smart. I am smart, Captain. Very smart. Unfortunately, having the greatest intellect on earth doesn't always help undo the impossible. You better be able to pinpoint that son of a bitch. Aquaman's doomsday device should be easy for me to find simply by locating the power source. A weapon capable of wiping out continents would require an astonishing amount of energy. Based on my analysis of the shockwave, our course should take us right over the origin point. But there's nothing, not a blip. I'm taking a big risk coming even this close to his waters. How close are we? See for yourself. That's a lot of death, even for me. I suggest if you want to prevent further tragedies of this magnitude... (thudding) (men screaming) (groans) Battle stations. Luthor: A bit too late for that, I think. (groans) (yells) (growls) (roars) (grunting and groaning) (groans) (mechanical whirring) Surface-dwellers, milord. Not Amazons. Meddlers, Orm. They're in my way. (grunts) Well, at least I know I was right. No survivors. This is crazy. You ought to be in Arkham. But I need to recreate the conditions of the accident that turned me into the Flash. Strap me in. You know, they say that lightning doesn't strike the same place twice. They say a lot of things. Now, why don't we pull the switch and find out. (powering up) Come on. (Thunder rumbling) Come on! I'm here! I'm right here! (screams) (screaming continues) (grunting) Oh, my god. President: I wish you had better news for me, Cyborg. This cloud of war grows ever darker and I fear we've run out of options. I just need a little more time, Mr. President. Victor, there is no more time. Lex Luthor is dead. His mission failed. But at least we know the estimated location of Aquaman's WMD. Sir, let my team take out the Atlantean device. Cyborg, you did your best recruiting metahumans to help us end this conflict. But our top analysts say, without the Batman, you have no team. It's time to send in the real heroes, son. The Atlantean tech will see them coming from half a world away, Mr. President. Let our boys worry about that. Thank you for everything you have done for this country, Victor, but, as of now, you're relieved of duty. (all cheering) (sobs) (clamoring) All: (chanting) War! War! War! War! War! War! War! (sighs) (man grunts) (woman sobbing) (laughing sadistically) (laughter echoing) (gasps) (groans) No! (groaning) Lie down. You have third-degree burns. You're lucky to be alive. (sighs) Somehow I remember things from this timeline. How Aquaman destroyed most of Europe. Maybe that lightning jogged your memory. But I can remember my world as well, a world where Aquaman would die before harming innocent people. My memories are changing, realigning with this new history Thawne's created. Soon I'll forget my timeline and everyone in it. My wife, your son... We're getting that world back. (scoffs) How? (grunts) We try again. Aquaman: Try again. But sire, the device is too dangerous. Our attack on New Themyscira destroyed an entire continent but still left the Amazon's new homeland untouched. More unholy magic from those witches. Next time, we will level their island. Please, my emperor, we tried to use only a fraction of the power and now it is even less stable. I feel we could sweep clean the ocean floor as well as the surface world. I see. Then we will take the witches' island by force, inch by bloody inch if necessary. They will pay for what they did to queen Mera. (grunts) I told you never to speak her name. Yes, my liege. Prepare the armadas for surface invasion. The Amazons' judgment is at hand. (grunts) Because of you, I'll be responsible for the deaths of millions. (Thunder rumbling) Batman: The odds against recreating the exact variables of the original accident are... Then just try to dowse the flames a little faster this time, okay? (machine powering up) (groaning) (screaming) Told you I was fast. (panting) This is Lois Lane of the Daily Planet. My battery is about to die and I will likely to be joining it soon. (arrows whooshing) (grunts) (roaring) Earlier today, the Amazons captured some of Aquaman's advance scouts. Wonder Woman's lasso made them spill their guts... Literally! (roaring) (sniffing) (footsteps retreating) Aquaman is leading his army through the English Channel tomorrow. The Amazons are worried that if he gets his secret weapon past their shield they'll be vulnerable. They remain defiant in the face of... (gasps) (growling) Final thoughts. If there is an afterlife, a cushy anchor job would not be out of line. (roaring wildly) Amazons! Be ready for... Who are you? What are you? (gasps) Don't worry, hot legs, we're on your side. Yes, fear not good lady, though our appearance is somewhat frightful. - We're... - The resistance, I know. Grifter, Godiva, Mrs. Hyde, Canterbury Cricket. (snorting) And some kind of demon from hell? To my share of chaos I make my claim and Etrigan is my name. Oh, great, he rhymes. That's not going to get old fast. (chuckles) Lois Lane's famous mouth. I can't believe you didn't get an arrow shot through it. I would've if it weren't for whichever one of you can run at super speed. So, who do I thank? I don't know what you think just happened, but there ain't no speedster on this team. Now, let's get out of here while we still can. Never seen anything like it. Your burns are healing. You should be dead. Your bedside manner sucks. If I didn't have the speed force helping me heal, I'd find another doctor. I own a casino. I haven't been a doctor in 20 years. Here, you need a suit and I'm not about to loan you one of mine. What? It's friction proof, isn't it? (sighs) I had to make some last minute alterations. I suggest you take it for a test run and make sure you can break that time barrier. Once we know that... (whooshing) So I'm finally on the other end of that trick. Come on, Barry, faster. Faster! (groaning) (groans and sobs) Nurse: If you would just slip these over your shoes, Mr. Jordan. Sure. The cleaning bill here must be murder. I'm afraid we don't have time for introductions, Captain Jordan. Pity. I was warned about you. But the president wanted the best pilot, so you're stuck with me. Why don't you show me what you've got hidden away here and I'll show you what I can do with it. Oh, crap. I was hoping this will shut you up. Crashed in the California desert eight years ago. Our scientists have been piecing it back together since then. Its handling capabilities are, well, beyond anything that we have. It may be a little tricky to get the hang of. Oh, and who's this handsome devil? - Pilot. - Died on impact? Kicked off just as my men found him. Report said he muttered something in English, "Beware my Power." Then, a glowing ring floated off his finger and shot into space. His ring flew away? You're about to fly a dead alien's spaceship and that's the part you're having trouble believing. Touche. You understand, Jordan, this mission is no cake walk. In fact... In fact, in all likelihood, it's a one-way trip. And if I'm afraid, if want to back out, no hard feelings, something like that? Something like that. General Lane, all my life I felt like something really special was waiting for me. Something nobody else on earth could do. I think I just found it, so the last thing I am is afraid. Flash: This thing is unbelievably slow, just like me. Batman: You move pretty fast to my eyes. I'm not fast enough to break the time barrier, which I need to do. The only thing I can figure is that another speedster is co-opting the speed force, keeping me from accessing enough energy to time travel. But there is no other speedster. Not in the real world... My world. So, it has to be Zoom. He's the only one who could've done this. He's deliberately preventing me from changing things back. Then nothing can be done. Even if we knew the trigger point, there's no one to go back in time and fix it. Superman could. I already told you, there's no metahuman that fits that description in this reality. I'm not so sure. In my new memories of this timeline, I saw something. A meteor. - It hit a city. - Metropolis, 30 years ago. The same day Superman's rocket crashed in my reality. Batman: So this never happened in your world? It must be a paradise. It's not. But at least there was hope. What makes you think your space baby survived? Flash: He's a tough cookie. Where's your contact? Don't worry. He's always on time. I have to admit, I didn't expect your call. Cyborg? Vic? You look different. Have we met? No. He's new. Super speed, goes by the Flash. You still need a strategist for your little army? Someone who can put together a team with a chance of shutting down Aquaman and Wonder Woman? I... Yes. I'll do it. But my way and I pick the team, starting with the Flash. Then we want to find the alien who crashed landed here in metropolis. Alien? What are you talking about? The meteor. It's not what your pals at the pentagon said it was. Classified information. We need it and you can get it. (beeping) Why aren't you telling him about me and the timeline? I'm not lying. You're misleading him. He has a right to know what our real plan is. I got enough misplaced morality to handle with a big metal boy scout on our hands. He wants to stop the war, so do we, that's all he needs to know. There's something there but it's above even my clearance. I don't hack into government systems, Batman. You do now. If you want me on your little suicide squad. Cyborg: I'm cycling their motion sensors and security cameras, but the loop won't go unnoticed for long. Batman: Early morning skeleton crew. Well, do your thing. (men grunting) I'm trusting that this is absolutely necessary. That's why we're here. Listen, I don't know what changed your mind or why, but with you on board, we can save the world from this war. Thank you. Focus on the mission at hand, Stone. Cyborg: Sir, are you okay? (screams) Is that Clark? This is the most powerful being on the planet? Help me. Oh, easy there friend. Everything's going to be fine now. Friend? That's right. Cyborg, here, is your friend. I'm your friend, too. This must be some kind of a mistake. A rogue division of the government. Keep telling yourself that. We should have left him where he was. He'd be safer. He needs the sun. Don't know if you can understand me, but what happened to you is wrong. - Most humans aren't like that. - They're worse. No. People are good. In fact, some of them risk their lives for the greater good. They're called heroes. Heroes? Don't worry, friend, everything's going to be okay. I thought heroes never lied. Soldier: (over speaker) Cyborg, stand down. You have exceeded your authority. Return the stolen government property or face immediate fire. You don't understand. They were using this man as a lab rat. I don't think they care, Vic. So beautiful. Soldier: I have direct orders from the president of the United States. Maybe I could end this peacefully. Yeah, maybe. (groans) No! Friends. (groans) Superman, close your eyes. (screams) What's wrong with him? He's having a seizure. Memories collapsing in on each other. We got to get him out of here. Fight it, Allen. Don't forget my son. Hal: Yee-haw! Hell, yeah! Lane: (on radio) Highball, this is papa bear. Cut the chatter. Oh, did I say that out loud? I didn't know. You're only 1,000 miles from drop zone. Commence radio silence. One last thing, Jordan. On behalf of all humanity... Oh, shut your hole already, you're ruining this for me. There you are, baby. Hold still for highball. Beware my power, asshole. (roars) Continue invasion preparations. Who the hell is this? He's with us. Now shut up. What's the story? Some kind of failed kamikaze attack on Aquaman's weapon. The pilot was Hal Jordan. Hal's dead? That's not all. The president sent a coalition fleet to New Themyscira. The Amazons decimated it. Troops are being ordered to Washington, DC, to protect the president and members of congress. Yeah. As our fearless leaders make a mad dash for the bunkers. What does it mean? It means the final battle between Atlantis and the Amazons has begun. But we haven't even started yet. There's nothing we can do now. Enjoy the things you love with the time we have left. There's bound to be looting in Gotham by now. I don't want to miss that. So you're just going to give up and wait for the inevitable? Is that what your heroes do here? Flash: Look, you guys may not know me, but all of us have powers, skills and abilities. Where I come, from heroes use those powers to fight to make the world a better place, whether it's their world or not. But Superman... You said he was our last best hope. We're alive, Vic, and where there's life, there's hope. We'll go to London, fight both sides and save the world in the process. Okay. Then we go, now. I'll signal the others, maybe they could meet us there. Bruce would have come. What the hell. Let's do this. Is the Batplane big enough for all of us? The what? Bruce's Batplane was a little more stoic. Your Batman didn't have to ferry high rollers with deep pockets in and out of his casino. So, he wouldn't need a fully stocked bar aboard. Everything is top shelf. Help yourself. I don't drink. Shocking. I'm glad I could persuade you to come along. You didn't. Ever since I told Cyborg I'd help, I've been scanning for intel coming out of Europe. During your little Braveheart speech, I heard an intercepted message you may find interesting. What? Batman: Lois Lane was an embedded reporter turned resistance fighter. She saw something in New Themyscira, a superbeing who could move in the blink of an eye. Thawne. If it was him, why let Lane live, much less help her? - If he's as fast as you... - Why let himself be seen? Incoming! (alarm blaring) Orm: Sire, the aircraft has been intercepted and nullified. Would that all our shots be so lucky. We have more than luck, Orm. (all grunting) (screaming) (roaring) Death to the under-dwellers! Kill them. Kill them all! (all yelling) (grunts) Etrigan: Behold man's final mad disgrace, he chops his nose to spite his face. (guns cocking) You've got to put an end to this. You're going to destroy the only world we've got. You won't have it much longer, surface-dweller. Grifter: Plan B. Take down as many on both sides as you can. Maybe we can kill enough of them to call off this war. (soldiers screaming) (grunting) Fight your way to the leaders. Once we have Aquaman and Wonder Woman, this war is over. (both grunting) (yells) (groans) You murdered my wife, Diana. She tried to assassinate me, Arthur. I was protecting myself. Yet you wear her helmet like a trophy. No, a warning. (yells) I can't believe I ever loved you. You never did. - (Aquaman grunts) - Flash: Now! All: Shazam! Wonder Woman: Captain Thunder. I'm happy to see that a real man is here to watch the end of man's world! (both grunting) (screams) (groans) (groans) Fall, damn it, fall! Sweet. I like your style, Batman. A pity we never teamed up when the world still existed. Batman and Grifter, the boy idiot. Take your team up the right flank... Don't worry, Batman. I'll stop the blood flow. You'll be as good as new. Don't be stupid, Allen. I may not be a very good doctor, but even I know a dead man when I see one. They're going to die. We're dead already. Find the speedster. Flush him out. Change all this. No! I won't stand by while people are... - Hello, Barry. - Thawne. (sipping) I love what you've done with the place. This is all your fault! (grunts) This has worked out so well. That's why I let Lois Lane see me, you know. I knew it would bring you. Not that you wouldn't have ended up here anyway, you hero, you. (both grunting) (screams in agony) (groans) (groans) (gun firing) (grunting) (groans) (grunting) What did you do to the world? Oh, Barry. That's the beauty of all this. I didn't do any of it. - You did. - (groaning) Think, Barry. Isn't there some little thing, some little good deed you might have done? I saved someone. Yes. I saved her. I saved mom. (grunts) That's right. No, no. It wouldn't have changed all this. It wouldn't have changed what happened before her murder. Bruce's parents, Clark's landing. Oh, but it did. Break the sound barrier and there's a sonic boom. You broke the time barrier Flash, time boom. Ripples of distortion radiated out through that point of impact, shifting everything just a tiny bit, but enough. Enough for events to happen slightly different. (grunts) I just wanted to save her. Her hero. How noble. Oh, wait. You didn't stop JFK from getting assassinated or make sure Hitler stayed in art school. You saved your mommy. You missed her, and in a supreme act of selfishness shattered history like a rank amateur, turned the world into a living hell moments away from destruction. And I'm the villain? (grunting) (snarling) (creature groaning) (grunts) (groans) No! (groans) (Cyborg screams) (thumping) (grunts) This form is not your own. How is the enchantment broken? With a word. Speak the word. (straining) Shazam! (groans) (all groaning) (gasping) - (Wonder Woman grunts) - (child gurgles) The era of the land-dweller is at an end, hero. (gasping) Your metal skull will decorate my great hall. (screams) (inhaling) Hero. Friend. (powering down) (grunts) (groans) No. (groans) Submit. You are beaten. Surrender? (coughs) then what? You'll let the men of Atlantis live as your slaves? The men? No, you are a pestilence the mother Gaia has suffered for too long, but perhaps Atlantis's daughters. There will be no glorious Victor Diana, no prize. What I do now, I do for the good of all. As do I. (grunts) (alarm blaring) (panting) What are you doing? Getting you out here before you... It's too late. (screaming) (groaning) Good job, Barry. The world is about to end, thanks to you. I hope your mother has a good view of it. You can't let this happen Thawne. You'll die, too. As you say in this era, totally worth it. Uh-uh-uh. As long as I can siphon off the speed force, you can't escape this timeline. I'm afraid there just isn't enough speed force to go around... - (gunshot) - (gasps) (groaning) There is now. You killed him. Not necessarily. (groaning) Not if you go back in time and fix this. (explosion) The only way to save the world is to keep this world from ever happening. Take this. Run. - (sighs) - (thudding) (Amazon screams) (straining) (grunting) Flash: Barry, stop! You'll kill everyone! Barry, stop. You have to stop. Other Flash: Who the hell? - Get away! - (grunts) (straining) (both grunt) Mom, I'm so sorry. (phone rings) - James: Barry. - (gasps) Look who's just joined the land of the living. Got to run, James. (gasps) If you don't finish the files by Friday, you'll be stuck here all weekend. Well, it's not the end of the world. (birds chirping) I think I finally got it, mom, the things you were trying to teach me. Iris: Barry? Iris? Well, (laughs) That's my kind of hello. Is everything all right? It is now, honey, it is now. Batman: Just to review, you broke the chronal barrier, went back in time, prevented your mother's murder and completely changed the time stream. Flash: Nearly destroying the entire world along the way, yes. There's still something I don't understand. I remember all of it, not just what happened after I woke up there, but my whole other life. I remember every birthday cake my mother ever baked me, my room, everything. Perhaps some kind of temporal after-effect? Or, perhaps, it was a gift. Yes, a gift. This is my father's hand writing. You're one hell of a messenger. Thank you.
