- Where does he live? - Jacinto? I believe in San Roque, 17. Thank you, madam. Bye. Bye. Where does he live now? Unknown address. Bye. Enrique Men?ndez Carmona! Enrique Men?ndez Carmona! Elecio O?ate! Elecio O?ate! Jacinto, Matador of young bulls! 14th, 1st. Good morning. A quart of milk! 1.75 I know. I'll bring the money tomorrow. Then come back for the milk tomorrow. Tell me ... who is the milk for? It's for me. If it is for you, then drink it here. And have some of this. I like it more at home. And to your uncle too. If he wasn't so lazy he would have enough money for breakfast. I never feed drunks. My uncle is not a drunk. If he doesn't drink, rheumatism causes him pain. Strange! And if he doesn't drink? If he drinks it also hurts, but he is happier. I'm also happier when I get paid. Go for the money, then you can have it. It won't get sour for a few minutes' wait. Yes, sir. Hey! Do you want to make some money? What do I have to do? You have to be a bull! We are arranging a bullfight! How much do you pay? More than anyone else. 20 cents. - For the fight? - For the stabbing. Do you have picadors? Just banderilleros. Deal? OK. We have a bull! That's not a bull ... It's a small but very brave bull. You'll see how he charges! Here, bull! Bull! Here, bull! Here, bull! Ol?! Ol?! Here, bull! Charge! - What do you want? - The 20 cents. Here. Here, bull! Ol?! Here, bull! Ol?! Will you continue? No, I have 40 more cents too many. Now, I want to be the bullfighter. - How much do you pay? - 20 cents, same as you did. No. - 30 cents. - No. - How much? - One peseta. I won't play! You pay 20 cents, and then ... Then what? Do you know what's the difference in price between a bull and a calf? If you don't know, then ask that loser uncle of yours. Hey, bull! Hey, bull! Here, bullock! I must go, it's 9 o'clock. Uncle ... Uncle ... Uncle Jacinto! Where did this come from? It rained quite hard. When? After the 8 o'clock flight. Why didn't you call me? I was watching the river. I bet you've made another dam! I've told you many times that water can be very dangerous! It's something you don't play with. But you are stubborn as a mule. Sometimes I wonder why do I care and worry so much about you when I could have a much better life being by myself. Didn?t you think that I could have drowned? Come on, let's go. BERNALDAS AGENCY BULLFIGHTING SHOWS To: Jacinto, Matador of Young Bulls. Dear Sir, This is a reminder that, as per our signed agreement, you must perform on a night festival that will take place in Las Ventas Bullring next Saturday 17th at 11 PM. For this, you will be paid the sum of 1,500 pesetas. Yours sincerely ..... Another letter regarding guardianship? No, it's not them. Who are they? I don't know. What do they want? They want to make fun of me. Are you the last one? Yes. Go ahead, lady. And you too. We are not in a hurry. Tickets, please. Tickets ... Today it will be good, because there were fightings yesterday. There are those guys ... They are early today. What's the matter? Don't you see what's written there? - No. - It's my name. Ja - cin - to. You see? My name appears in a comedy bullfight. It could be someone else. I am the only Jacinto who is a bullfighter. The letter was right. Let's go. May I use the telephone? Sure. Where is the phone book? Anything else? A coffee with milk. Bernaldo Agency? I'm Jacinto. Could you please explain to me why have you sent me a letter telling me I'm bullfighting tonight and why is my name in the posters? I just saw one at the bullring. Jacinto. Yes, Jacinto, with a "J". What? I've never been in that office. I am a retired bullfighter, but a serious one. I'm not a comedy bullfighter. Yes, I'll wait. Yes? Narciso? But "Narciso" is not "Jacinto". I am Jacinto. If you have made arrangements with Narciso, then don't write my name. Yes, sure, a mistake. But your mistake is not my fault. What? I'm not screaming so you can hear me. I'm screaming because this is abusive. OK I'll call you back in one hour. Here is the money. What do those people think? My name in a comedy bullfight! What is a comedy bullfight? It's something stupid. It's doing silly things so that the public can laugh at one. But is there a bull in the show? Just a little one. And some clowns, and a band, and nonsense. All what should never be in a bullfight. Just for evening spectators. Idiots! Hi, will you let me ride? No, but I'll let you push me. I pushed you yesterday and you told me I could ride today. I did not say "today". I said "tomorrow". You lying fatso! You fatso! Pepote! Are you guys coming? A genuine American Parker 51 fountain pen. I'll sell it cheap. I'm selling it cheap, sir. A Parker fountain pen. It's wet. Hello? Has Mr. Bernaldas arrived? Yes, it's me. What can I do for you? I already spoke with your secretary. I am Jacinto. Yes, they told me. It was a mistake ... And do you think that your explanation settles the matter? That mistake is causing me grief! I am willing to insert a correction notice in the media. And, no further offense intended, I would even consider offering you the job. Because I must admit I don't know how to find Narciso before tonight. Would you take my offer? Yes, I do accept. The terms of the agreement are in the letter. If you want to see me, we can meet in a couple of hours. We'll meet at the bullring. Do you have a bullfighter's costume? Of course I do. If you need something ... Thank you. So far I haven?t' reach that point. Please be punctual. Don't worry. Are you going to bullfight? It looks like I will. When there is a proper bullfighter, the bull's size does not matter. Wouldn't it be better if your friend comes here to try it on? He can't. That's why he asked me. He is about my size. Look at this one, it's a smaller size. Be quiet, kid! I think this is the right one. How much does it cost? The price tag is one the sleeve. 3,000 pesetas. It is like new, but I will give it to you for 2,000. This way, you can make 1,000 pesetas profit, or more. I just want to rent it. For how long? Just for tonight. - For a costume party? - No. - For a movie? - No. Please, don't be so secretive. Prices vary depending on what you want it for. It's for the bullring. Then you will need the full attire. From the shoes to the tail. And also a bullfighting cape. No need for a cape. OK, I'll give you a good price. Since it is obvious that the custom is for you .... you can rent it for 300 pesetas. Keep in mind that I will take care of tears and bloodstains. And I have to pay that guy 50 pesetas to keep an eye on you. I cannot risk to lose the costume. Stop it, kid ... You can put it on here. Federico will take your clotting to the bullring and he will bring back the costume after the bullfight is over. 300 pesetas ... And you must pay in advance I cannot give you credit. And I didn't ask for it! Then we have a deal. I'll leave here my umbrella as a guarantee. And where will I find 300 pesetas? Let's go for more cigarette butts. See that truck? The box filled with butts would be worth 300 pesetas. I'm going to get a shave. Get out! It's mine! Thank you. - Good morning. - Hello. - Good morning. - Hello, Pepote. I've got a stamp. Let me see. Not bad. What do you think? One from Nicaragua? If possible, I would prefer money. Money? Well ... One peseta? Thank you. I'll be back in a moment. Good morning. Hey, would you carry those beds to the store? OK I'll be ahead of you. If you arrive first, start unloading. How much do I owe you? 50 pesetas. It's noon and you are already drunk? 5 pesetas, that's all! I've never done that type of work, but I don't think 5 pesetas is enough. Hi, Pepote. Good morning, se?or Paco. Do you want to work with me? Well ... I don't know. I don't want him to. The kid already has work. But not as good as the one I'm offering to him. He is doing honest work. He could make in a day between 30 and 50 pesetas. By cheating on people? And why do you need him? There are many more around. Look for another one. Be careful. I don't accept any lessons regarding my job. I like him because he is smart, he is handsome, and I want him to succeed in life. With that face. And I will smash yours if you don't leave him alone! Really? I don't think so. Let's go. BREAK TIME. Wait here. Come back in half an hour, then the contractor will be here. If it was up to me, you would start working tonight as night watchman. But you better talk to him first, then there will be no problem. Dou you think I could ask for a cash advance? A what? A cash advance? You don't know what you are saying. Yes ... I need 300 pesetas. You are out of your mind. Why? Don't even try that! You could put me into trouble. And why is that? Can you imagine if I was to recommend you as a night watchman, and the first thing you did was asking for a cash advance? They would kick me out of here! A cash advance ... 300 pesetas? You are dreaming. That's minister's wages. The working class does not have any time left to make money. 300 pesetas is a lot. I know, but I need that money. Why don't you try the phone book business? What's that? I'm not sure. Because G?mez won't say a word. But it must be an easy job, because he likes it. Today I was supposed to call him. I won't call him, and you will go instead. Agreed? Agreed. All I know is that you cannot ask anything. The guy is a strange person The least you say, the better. Does he pay well? I don't know, but look at Gomez's suit! It's not a cheap one from El Rastro. Where do I have to go? To La Huerta, to the porter's place, in the attic. Above the doorsill there is a sign that says "Restorer". Tell him I'm sending you. Thank you. Can I play with you? Yes, sure you can. Now is your turn. Sheer luck. Hi. The match man sends me. Why did he send you here? G?mez cannot come today. Did something happen to him? I don't know. What's the match man's name? Miguel. You will have to deliver a phone book to a certain address. Then you will swap it for another one they will give you there. That's all You will be paid 50 pesetas for every phone book you swap. You cannot work with those clothes because you will likely have to visit some luxury places. Well, I could go home and wear my tuxedo. Don't try to be funny. Where is the phone book and where do I have to deliver it? Relax. Sit down and wait. For how long? I'll tell you when you can go. It could be 10 minutes or 4 hours. - Then I won't do it. - Wait! 50 pesetas, plus 10 more for waiting. OK. I'll wait 30 minutes for 10 pesetas. 30 cents. Five for me. How much for the big ones? Those are not for sale. I am asking for a small subsidy for the last defender of pure music. Thank you. Thank you very much. Go away, kids! Oh... Do you like music, boy? Yes. Would you like to be a musician? I would rather be a shoeshine boy. What? A shoeshine boy, you said? And why? Because one can make a lot of money. It would be shame if you go for such a low job. I could help you if you wanted to become a musician. There is nothing more beautiful than music. I don't know about that. Come, let's talk. I'll buy you a soda. You won't be my employee, but rather my partner. We could become very rich in no time. You will collect the money while I perform. You will ignore the elderly and the children, you will waste your time if you don't. Don't say anything, but smile ... always smile. When you ask for something, you must smile. - Did you understand? - Yes. I promise I will make you an artist. Are bullfighters artists? Partly. They are half artists half butchers. Why do you ask? My uncle is a bullfighter. A very good bullfighter. What's his name? Jacinto. Never heard of him. The bill! Keep it until I make you a sign. And now, catch a fly. What for? To avoid temptation. The souls of sinners go straight to hell. That's why one must avoid temptation. Many times I won't be able to keep an eye on you because you may be behind me or behind the organ. Then you may be tempted to keep 10 cents or even 1 peseta .... some people may give 1 peseta. To avoid temptation, you will keep a fly in your right hand. Catch one. Here are a few. Listen very well. If you quash it or if it escapes, I'll beat you. Go ahead. The half hour must be over by now. Not yet. Sorry, but today I cannot wait any longer. It's today when I need you. Wait here. If I wait for another 30 minutes you will pay me another 10 pesetas. Hello? Yes, it's me. Eh? Mariscal Restaurant. Three booths. Sure, right now. Don't worry. Go immediately to Mariscal Restaurant. Catch a cab and deliver these 3 phone books. Because there are 3 booths. Here is the money. 50 pesetas and 10 more for the cab. Now go. The total is 150 pesetas. - Why? - Because 3 times 50 makes 150. But you are delivering all 3 to the same place! It's 50 per phone book. Those are your words. Well, we cannot waste more time. Here are 50 pesetas more and go away. Get out! And take a cab! I paid for it! Taxi! Taxi! To Mariscal Restaurant! You bandit! You thief! I'll punish you in front of all those people! Leave the kid ... Do you have Chesterfield? No, but I'll get you a pack. Here. Thank you. Well, kid. I'm doing it better. Does one have to attend school a lot to become a shoeshine boy? The least, the better. Do you like this job? A lot. And also whistling with the fingers. But I don't know how to. It's very easy! How is it done? Come here one morning before I start working. If I can, I will be here. Hey! Through the service door. - Good morning, Miss. - Good morning. I came to replace the phone books. Didn't they replace them at the beginning of the year? Yes, but there are many new numbers. Could you give me the old ones? Good morning. And now, going back to the painting, what have you decided? Nothing. That painting is too big a luxury for me. Too big a luxury? Like if I didn't know you and I know you well. This is no luxury, but rather a good business. One must be lucky to find a Murillo nowadays. And at that price, it's a steal. Don't you realize? It's a Murillo. Yes, but I know nothing about art. That's why I am here. The important thing is that you like it and you liked it a lot this morning. Yes, but that painting should be in a museum rather than in my home. That's correct. But the El Prado Museum is not keeping it due to lack of funds. And have you reached an agreement? Yes, from the beginning. And what is the appraisal value of the painting? 5000 pesetas lower than what they asked you for. It is strange for a museum to lack funding, isn't it? It's quite normal. State museums usually don't have large subsidies. So sellers have to wait up to 3 years before getting paid. In this case, the painting's owner needs the money urgently. But you don't believe me ... And why shouldn't I believe you? No, you don't believe me. Waiter, bring the phone book, please! To clear your doubts you can contact the museum. Me, talking to them? Yes, you. They will remember the painting, because they have had it for 3 months. I see. Here it is. Sorry, I forgot my glasses. You can look for the number yourself. El Prado Museum. Director's Office. Hello? El Prado Museum, Director's Office. I don't know if he has arrived. Who is calling? Could you wait a moment, please? S?nchez Cant?n speaking. Hi, se?or Paco. Hi, Pepote. How are things with you? May I work with you? Well ... Of course. Come here. What will I have to do? Something quite simple: be by my side when I speak and say every now and then "dad, I'm hungry!" Dad, I'm hungry. Dad, I'm hungry. The way you speak, neither you are hungry nor I am your father. You have to say it in a very sorrowful manner to make it sound believable. "Dad, I am hungry" ... like if you were about to cry. "Dad, I am hungry"... Let's try. Dad, I'm hungry. Dad, I'm hungry. That's much better. Now, let's prepare the watch. Here is one with a stupid looking face. We stay away from the ones with a stupid looking face. Anyone buying something for 300 pesetas when he thinks it's worth 2000 is nothing but a crook. Let's go. It's done. Give me some more. There are no more. There are no more? No! Why not? I did a good job. I can deliver 8 per day. Maybe I will call you another day. That's enough for today. But ... today I need money. I'm not interested. Leave those clothes here and leave. The cap! Sir, would you buy my watch? I'm selling it cheap. Dad, I'm hungry. What do you want, son? You'll eat when we arrive home. I apologize for the kid. His mother deals with him but unfortunately now .... He is the oldest. - Dad, I'm hungry. Dad, I'm hungry. - I know, son. Be quiet. We'll go to the hospital to see mummy, and afterwards you will eat. But first we have to buy the injections. They say that if she gets the injections she will live. Otherwise it will be a matter of days. You would do the same thing. Anything but letting her die at the age of 28, and just for 300 lousy pesetas. We'll see how we manage later. As long as we are healthy ... Will you give me 300 pesetas? May I see it? Later, after the gentleman has made his decision. 300 pesetas for two injections. - 200 pesetas. - I can't. I paid 1920 pesetas. When was that? Two months ago, before my wife underwent surgery. Which make is it? Omega. If it is an Omega, I'll give you 250. 250? At least 300. And this gentleman is first. Dad, I'm hungry. Dad, I'm hungry. Very well, I'll buy it. Thank you. Thank you very much. Let's go now. Did I do it well? Well? You almost made me cry. You are a smart kid. Come. Where are the 10 pesetas? Here ... 5 ....10. Are you happy? You scoundrel! You cheater! Didn't I tell you to leave the kid alone? Look at his idiot, the scene he is making! And just to harm the business. I'll deal with you! Go! Better feed the kid, or at least let him work! Bah! While I work myself to death you are with that scoundrel learning how to scam people. I don't want to see you again with him! It will be very difficult to find another one like him. This kid was great for the business. Hey, why don't you try mine? Do you have ....? - Yes. - And how is he? Like me. Then he is not the right one. Keep it. You've earned it. I've earned it for you! Are you still short, Jacinto? At least 50%, or more. Because I will have to take a cab to go to the bullring, and I will have to eat. If you were different, you could do the watches scam. That's a great business. To make 10 pesetas? Don't be silly. If you sell them, all the profit is yours. But one has to have the watches. Of course. Paco buys them for 65 pesetas each. With what you already have, you can buy two. And you will still have some money left. Me, buying....? I'm not good for that. I can do it for less. We'll talk another time. I've thought about it, and 50 pesetas is too much. I can do it for less. You are an idiot! Would you please leave and never come back again? Where can one buy the watches? Ask for S?nchez, in "La Vi?a de Oro" (The Golden Vineyard") Don't pay more than 70 pesetas for each watch. Will you help me? Yes! Wait here for me. Do you know se?or S?nchez? He is se?or S?nchez. Are you se?or S?nchez? That depends. I would like to talk with you. About what? About watches. Come with me. It was over there. How much does that crook ...well, Paco ...sell the watches for? For 300 pesetas. That's incredible. That's a great business. Come with me. Please let him wash his hands, then groom him a little. Go in. How much for this? 38 pesetas. Sorry, I don't have enough. How much can you pay? OK, it's yours. Thank you. Hurry up, it's getting late. I'm ready. - Hey, Pepote. - What? Hey, what did se?or Paco tell them? When? When he wanted to sell them the watch. He was talking about the hospital and about injections. He said he paid a lot of money for it. 2000 pesetas or more. And what did you say? "Dad, I'm hungry". That's all. That's not right. It's a disgrace to say that. With me you will say .... you will say ... What if I ask for tiger nut milk? Would that be better? Well, yes... I suppose. Let's go. Sir, will you buy a watch from me? No. Sir, I must sell this watch. To whom? - To you. - Why to me? Because I need money. I see. And why do you need money? It's a matter that just come up. And what would that be? Her wife is in the hospital It's quite a serious matter. Dad, I want tiger nut milk. Is that all? Yes, that's all. Here. This is for the tiger nut milk. Excuse me, sir ... I'm selling this watch. How much do you want for it? 300 pesetas. Are you a merchant? No, sir. In that case, why are you selling watches? Because I don't have any money. Understood. Is it yours? Yes, sir. He paid a lot for it. Over 1000 pesetas. Is that so? Yes. And if he paid so much, why is he selling it for 300 pesetas? His wife is sick and I am hungry. Don't lie! He just wants a tiger nut milk. I'm not sure I like it. Do you have another one? Yes, sir. I have another one. Come with me to the police station. And don't make any fuzz, eh? Yikes! They caught him. You wait here. Is he your father? No, he is my uncle. What has he done? Nothing. Who did you steal these watches from? From nobody. I haven't stolen anything. You found them around a corner? No, sir. Then? I bought them. From whom? I'm asking you from whom did you buy the watches. Answer! I don't know. You don't know where, either? In the street. In what street? In Gran Via? I don't remember. Lock him up. Let's see if he remembers. You'll have plenty of time to remember! Ask headquarters to check for a criminal record. And bring the kid. Where are you at? This building's sanitation is very poor and some rooms are in a deplorable condition. We fear the worst if this situation is not promptly corrected. Looks good. Did you mention the basement? What's your name? Pepote Garc?a. How old are you? I'm six. Why are you lying? You are older than that. Are you going to school? Not yet. Do you know how to read? How to write? No, but I know the numbers. Here, eat this. I'm not hungry. - Did you already eat? - Yes. You have to answer "yes, Sir". - Did you get that? - Yes. What did you eat? Coffee, bread, omelet and peppers. - With your uncle? - Yes. I also eat his portion, because he wasn't hungry. - Do you live with him? - Yes. In that case, you won't like him to be here for too long. Right? No. Ah! In that case you have to tell me where he got those watches from. He bought them. From whom? From a man. And where? In the street. What's the news, M?ndez? He doesn't have a criminal record. Very well. Take the kid and bring back the other one. Make everything clear! They must understand that this building is not a pig house. It is currently unsuitable as a police station. Well, did you give it a second thought? Do you remember now who sold you the watches? I don't know his name. Where did you meet him? In the street. You better don't make me run out of patience. You bought them at a jeweler, in Puerta del Sol. I didn't way that. I bough them in El Rastro. Well, well ... in El Rastro. Probably from the one-legged man. No! Are you trying to make me believe that you got them from The Parrot? I'm not trying such a thing! If it was neither of them, It must have been ... You waste your time, I didn't buy them in El Rastro. And if you think I am an informant, you are wrong. Have you seen S?nchez lately? Yes, Sir. Find him and bring him here. You must also mention the windows. None of them closes properly. Either they fix them or all of us will die this coming winter. S?nchez ...! I was looking for you. The boss wants to talk to you. To me? About what? Now I am an honest citizen! You can ask around! If I did something wrong, that was in the past! Now I am a decent person! Nobody can reproach ...! Let's go. So, here you are again. Not because I want to. Of course not. If you were to change your profession you would not be visiting us. Mr. Inspector, it's very difficult to change my profession at my age. It's your call. OK, let's see what you have. Don't forget to mention the toilet. It's a total disgrace. And how do I say that? Just be clear and to the point. The whole washroom area is way below the minimum accepted standards for areas meant for that type of purpose. Full stop. And this time you brought all your stock with you. I suppose all of them are fakes. Just the ones with expensive brand names. Do you know him? Not much. Is he a good customer? No way. Today he bought from me for first and last time. Do you know if he bought from others? I don't think so. Take him downstairs. I'll let you go because it's your first time here. But if I see you again, I'll send you to jail. We'll let you know what will happen with your watches. I said only 'you' can go! The kid stays here. What? He hasn't done anything. His case will be dealt with by the Protection of Minors' Department. They will know what to do so that, in the future, he becomes a decent man. Of course, that is if you don't have any objections. Yes, I do have some objections! He has always lived with me since he became an orphan. How old is he? He just turned 7. Six! And he still doesn't go to school? That's because he doesn't want to. Have you registered him? Under your care, he will become a bum or something even worse. What right do you have to stop them from making him a decent man? If you really love him, you must talk to him. Tell him this is all for his own good. Pepote .... you've heard him. Mr. Inspector ... I can't .... Leave me alone! I want to go with him! I want to go with him! I want to go with him! Listen! You and I are going to talk. I don't want to talk! I want to leave! Let me go! That's enough! Aren't you ashamed of behaving like a savage? There will be a time in which you may go with him if you so wish. When? When your uncle works and can properly support you. My uncle does work. Today, he bought me this shirt, this tie and these shoes. What kind of work does he do? Whatever he finds, same as I do. Ah! Do you also work? Yes. I take care of cars, I call cabs, I set the right time in clocks ... When I have a stamp I either trade it or sell it. Today I got 1 peseta for the one that was on this letter. He will be paid 1500 pesetas for bullfighting tonight. But is he a bullfighter? Apparently, yes. He could have said so. If he is not a bum, he has the right to have the kid. You promise you will attend school if I let you go? Yes, Sir! See if you catch up with him! Come on, let's go. Do you know why did they let me go? Because I promised them I will attend school. I must do it, because I promised the cops. Or not? - Do you have enough for the subway? - Yes. Then, go home. - Didn't you hear me? - Are you going to drink? Yes! That's the only right I have left: to get drunk! Nobody can stop me from doing that! And you shut up and do what I say! Go home! I won't say it again! Go away! Go! Go! 500 pesetas? That's robbery. It's already late. Even if it was 3 AM, I pay 2 pesetas per bag, not a cent more. Take or leave it. We won't do it for less than 500. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, I'll do it for 300 pesetas. Do you have a crew? Yes, sir. - Can you start right now? - Yes, Sir. The truck is in the warehouse. When you are done, look for me at Isidro's bar. Yes, Sir. Don't close! Don't close. My uncle will come! What's the matter? Tell him not to close! Why? It's already time. My uncle will come. Does he have the money? No, but he will have it later? Later? When is that? I don't know. He is looking for it. Besides, he will be paid a lot when he bullfights tonight. He can bullfight, but not with my costume. - Did you lock the backdoor? - Yes. Let's go. Give him back the umbrella. He can return it to his uncle. Here. What are you doing? My uncle will come! I want the costume! No money, no costume! This is not a charitable organization! Get out of here! I will pay you when I grow up! When you grow up ...? Grab him! I don't want to leave! I don't want to leave! I don't want to leave! Leave the kid alone, you animal! Listen! If you don't leave, I'll call the cops! Call them! I want the costume! The costume? Did you see? Are you hurt? I want the costume! I want the costume! Shut up! And now, what's the matter? I want the costume. OK, wait until that man arrives. I hold you responsible for that costume. If something happens to it, I'll punch you! That's it! I'm going to get my uncle! Uncle Jacinto! Uncle Jacinto! Uncle Jacinto!! Have you seen my uncle? Who is your uncle? What a scoundrel. He was to unload the truck and instead he gets drunk like a skunk. Uncle Jacinto ... Uncle! Uncle Jacinto! Uncle, I got the costume! Don't you hear me, Uncle Jacinto? Wake up! We got the costume, but you are drunk. You scoundrel, you drunk! What time is it? It's late! Hurry up, we've got the costume! Stand up, we've got the costume! Let's go! Stand up, we've got the costume! Lie on me! That's it! We're ready. Let's go. This way. Shall we take a cab? If you have money ... A bullfighter! Look, kids, a bullfighter! Go away, kids! Here is your bullfighter's cape. Go this way and take a seat. Are you Jacinto? Yes. We are your quadrille. We thought you weren't coming. We are starting now. Just a couple of times, to see how he reacts. Enough! Ole! - Hello! - Do you know where we are? In the bullring of Las Ventas! We are in the bullring! In the bullring? Didn't you hear me? And we are going to bullfight! Look! A bullfighter! Of course! It is the Great Jacinto! He is the bravest of the bullfighters! Good evening! Ladies and gentlemen! I'll give you half of my pay if you don't touch the bull. What are you saying? That's impossible. I'll give you 750 pesetas. Well, you are the one who is responsible for this. Swear that you will pay us. I swear. Leave it! Careful with the bull! My watch! He broke my watch! My watch! My watch! Give me the sword. Hey, what about the banderillas? Stay away! Don't take it so hard. Why not? I haven't seen anything. What? You didn't see it? No. One of the ushers caught me, and since I didn't have a ticket he kicked me out. When? Just after it started. You didn't see the beginning? Yes, but that was all. And nothing else? No. What a pity. Did you do well? Yes, I did well. I gave the bull a few veronicas and I ended with a half. And then? And then ... with the short cape. It was a good bull ... it cooperated. it had its potential. Here is to you, Pepote! English subtitles by O Cangaceiro
