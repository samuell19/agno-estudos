Good morning. - Did you see any dolphins? - No, not yet. Why don't you wash properly? He should arrive today. Well, so what? Go and make some swimming exercises. And you'll not be gone for long! He will arrive today. From now I have to carry the oars. I had better get used to it. I'll take it. And you're leaving. I don't want to leave. But the summer is over, my child. You have to go to school. We'll have a storm tomorrow. Grandpa, why not pull the boats ashore? The boats... they belong to the sea. See what the weather has done to it. Why don't you build a new boat? At my age! Just like that? Oh, there'll be a wind today! Here, it's windy almost every day. I'll bring you something. - Wind? - Yes, maybe the wind. - Where will you catch it? At sea? - Yes. Grandpa, can I come along? And who will greet your father? What if he arrives and nobody is home? - He might not wait for you. - I don't want to leave. THE FIRST BUS NOON THE LAST BUS. Enough of your government! I also want to be a leader! Find the cross-marked crab and you'll be the leader. Throw! I'll go for it! - Are you ready? - Yes. Attention! Attention! I'll throw this crab, marked with a cross, into the sea. Look, and if you find it, you'll be the leader. Well, come on! Look guys, a dolphin! - What are you afraid of? - Throw! It shouldn't take that long. Maybe he hit his head ...or something. Why are you so ugly? Just creeping and crawling. Why are you shaped like that? His head, his head appeared. No. It's only a stone. Look there, to the right. Now I'm the leader. I have the crab. Crabman, come here! Look! It's not the right one? - It's not the right one. - There is no cross. - It's another one. - And he wants to be the leader? You can catch a crab, but not the right one. Listen, guys! This crab has a cross. I found it on the beach. So what? You're cheating us. Calm down! What this young lady says is a joke. She painted the cross herself. It's a fake. Dimwit! Come on, gentlemen. Don't sulk, Duck. Being second is also good. But I did find a crab. Why are you sitting on my clothes? - You'd better get dressed. - Why? I'll get a tan faster. Are you not shy? Grandpa won't let me bathe with my clothes on. I might catch a cold. Show me. Is that all? - Just some of it. - You can also get a nice collection. Like you? Walk all day in the wet sand, and scrub my knees for some stupid stones. Who are you really! These are precious! Then I too have a treasure. Stupid! You're also stupid! No, you're stupid! Do you collect stamps too? Well, I used to. - And matchboxes? - Yes, when I was young. What else do you collect? I have a collection of butterflies. Yuk, that's disgusting. Crushing their heads and poking pins into them. No, I put them to sleep with ether. That's cruelty. I hate killing. And do you know what else I collect? I also collect car brands. - Really? - It's true! When I lived in Moscow, I walked the streets, looking for cars and rare brands. I got a great collection. Chater-Lea, Rolls-Royce, Citroën, Buick, Studebaker, Fiat. And they told me that the embassy of Virinoska had a Jaguar, and that it was the only Jaguar in Moscow. I searched the whole town, every single street. It turned out that this embassy didn't even exist. - I have a secret. - What? - I won't tell. - Foolishness. I'm wasting my time on you, when I should be at home waiting. - What's your secret? - I won't tell. Who are you waiting for? My father. I'm only here on my holiday. My parents are working here now. Will you leave now? No, I'll wait. I'm sure he'll come. What is your secret? I won't tell you. I won't tell anyone. - Do you swear? - I swear. - Not on your pioneer's honour. - How then? You have to dive under water and stay until I count to twenty. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty! That was how many seconds? How many? I didn't count. There were so many jellyfish! Red and white. I wanted to catch some. But they are no good. They know how to burn you. It's a good thing you are so brave. Come on, come on. - Are we there now? - There, at the top. - Well... I want to know something. - My name? - Yes. What is your name. - Vika. My name is Romas. Hello! You see, no one has ever climbed the Devil's Finger. Only one boy. It was during the war, and he prevented the fascists from passing through the mountains. - And then they pushed him down? - No, nobody could. Was he killed up there? He's a ghost. Nobody ever saw him. So, he died. It's me! Or maybe he's still alive? What are you waiting for, Romas? Come here. Goodbye! Here it is even better. Who ate the fruit of the forbidden tree? Eve! Eve! Eve! Eve! Eve! Eve! Eve! Eve! Eve! Eve! Eve! - One of my uncles climbed down here. - Did he die? No. They threw him a rope and pulled him up. - Can we also climb down here? - Dare you try it? Oh yes. No, we'd better drop a stone first. Goodbye! Be quiet. Be quiet! There is an echo here. You have to be quiet. I can see you. I hear you. Well, you do have a collection. - I have never seen anything like this. - What do you mean? I mean that you really have a collection. It's a pity you cannot bring it with you. Yes, it doesn't fit into a box. Vika! Vika! Vika! Where did you get that horn? This horn? My grandfather gave it to me. Would you like to throw away these stones? But they are precious. But if you would like to... - The box too? - Yes. Where are you going? I'll go and get our clothes. Look what I found! - What did you find? - A crab. What's this? A hunting horn? I don't know. Vika was here before. Leave it, do you hear? Look! Little Vika is bathing naked! - You fools! - Who did you call a fool? What did you say? What are you staring at? You can be the goalkeeper. Romas! Come back! Leave the clothes, do you hear? Hey there, Crabman, come here! What's the big deal! I always bathe naked. Romas. Bring me my dress, Romas. Give them to her, Romas. You try it! Well then, give the lady her panties. Romas, bring them. Romas. Yuk, you're a marinated herring. Coward! You vile coward! Vika... Damn! Did you hear what she called me? I'm a coward. A coward. Do you see? I am a coward. - Yes, you're a coward and a wimp. - I am? After all, you started this. Come on, Duck. He is the lady's boyfriend. In my opinion he's a wuss. He obeyed my orders! I'm the boss here. You'll always be the boss, because you ignore the marked crabs. - Would you have another go? - Why? And be fooled again. Oh, that's your own private gossip. And you, what do you think about this? He's a redneck. I don't know anyone here. I've just arrived. - Would you like to join us? - Yes. And what will you give us? - What do you want? - Do you have flippers? No. - A camera? - No. - Do you collect stamps? - No. What do you have? - I know a secret. - What? A secret? A secret. Hello. Hello!? Good morning. Good morning? Good morning? Hello... Hello. Who's there? - Good morning. - Good morning... Good morning. Hello. Hello. Hello... Who's there, please? Mama is not at home. Come on, hurry. I don't like this any more. - I don't want to go further. - What? - This is so scary. - Don't be afraid. Here it is. Hello! It's me! - Let's move higher up, guys. - Okay, we go higher. Duck, don't get behind. I see you! I don't see anybody. Neither do I. Guys, he ran off! Catch him! - Look for him! - Go in circles and search, in circles! You will hear from us again! - There! - After him! He's not here. He could be hiding somewhere. Let's go back. Mountains! Mountains! Mountains! Mountains! Devil Finger! Devil Finger! Devil Finger! Devil Finger! Hi! So you greet me, hello, hello. Stay put. No one seems to be at home. My girl has gone for a walk, and left you on your own. Devil Finger! Devil Finger! Devil Finger! Devil Finger! Why are you screaming? Don't be afraid. He is only angry when he's chained. - Why don't I hear the echo? - Echo? Probably because the wind is blowing from the wrong direction. You have to find a suitable place, and call from there. Come on. Let's try this spot. Devil Finger! Do you understand, young man? You have to stand up there. Now you try. No, that won't do. You must stand on all fours. Vika! Vika! Wait, Vika? Do you know her? She's my daughter. Let's go and look for her. Wait, Grandpa, wait! I'll help you. - Where's your father? Has he arrived? - No. Is this one for me? How big it is! And it has spines. Listen to it. Hold it to your ear. Like this. Do you hear? - You don't hear it? - No. Give it me, and I will listen. There's no wind today. Grandpa, don't throw it away. Give it to me. I'll listen again, Grandpa. Give it to me. No, my girl. You won't hear anything. Grandpa, I hear, I hear. Well? So quiet, so you can barely hear it. So quiet, as when clouds float across the sky... and water dripping. Also the sea roaring and screaming seagulls, louder and louder. Really? In this spiny conch? - Well? - Wait. I can hear someone singing, far, far away. Sailors also sing. Can I listen? That's meaningless. You cannot hear them. Oh, you! Grandpa, don't go! I like this one. It's so beautiful. Today it's calm. We'll have a storm tomorrow. Then I can really hear. Summer is over. You must leave me now, my child. I don't want to. Dad! I'm here! I found you! I found you! I found you! I found you! Come to me, my only, my darling. But first you close your eyes. They're already closed. Hurry, please! What will I get? Do you promise that I can come back? Thank you. Do you promise that I can come back? Of course you can. - Do you swear? - For sure, I swear. Not like that. You must dive under water and hold your breath for twenty seconds. No, forty! Where's your bathing suit? Okay, easier without clothes. I'll undress. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen... fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty. Twenty one, twenty two... Did I make it? - Yes. - Do you believe me? I cannot hear you! I do. And finally the crab. Bring it out! - Call Crabman. - Hey there, Crabman. Your crab has a cross, mine has a circle. You throw my crab and I yours. Maybe it's better not to jump. - All these waves... - Well, I'll dive for sure. - Throw them far out. - Never mind. Already tossed. What are you waiting for? Dive! Why are you just standing there? Jump into the water! Try it yourself. Look at the waves. Duck, you can be the leader. Go for it! Go ahead! Why hesitate? Dive! He can go on as the boss. I'm afraid of those waves. Not you! Who calls me a coward? Say that again! - The girl said that. - That's foolishness anyhow. Where are the others? Ashamed and they ran off. You scared them. - Why are you still here? - Me? I'll be the new adjutant. - And he will be the new Crabman. - Pooh! - Who called me a coward? - The girl did. Where are you going? Would you be my second? Never mind. Let's find another leader. Goodbye, Grandpa. Dad. Give me a coin! Where's Vika? - She's left. - She's gone? Vika! Vika, wait! - Wait! - What do you want? Crabs. Crabs, Vika! Look, marked crabs. I caught them. Now I'll be the leader. Don't you believe me? I'm not a coward. I found them myself. Crabs, crawling around all life long. To who's joy? To the airport? Vika, hurry up! You'd better catch the echo. Vika, wait! THE END
