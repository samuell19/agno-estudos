Pusa. - Yes. - I'm leaving. Wait, wait! I left my suitcases in the room. - What suitcases? - What suitcases... Suitcases. - What am I gonna do with them? - Dunno, take 'em to storage. Right, the big one and the plastic one. Let me show you something. Something I made. Listen, I want this door to remain closed. Closed, yes. This one's violet. This one's orange. They're complementary. What do you think? They're woolen. Feel them. Here. What are they? Little hats. Let me get you a bag or something. What's with you? What happened? What's with you? Hello?! I don't know what to think of this man anymore. He's like a girl. Come on, put them in. You should've brought a smaller one. - That's what I have. - They'll wrinkle. They won't wrinkle. You should've turned them over. - Here. - Hold on. Let me hold it. - Take them out when you get home. - Don't you have a smaller one? No. It's perfectly fine. Kisses. Good night. Kiss you. Train 1798 from Piatra Olt is arriving at Terminal 3. Train 663 for Iasi, with stops in Ploiesti and Buzau is leaving from Terminal 5. Brasov, minus 2 degrees. Minus 11 in The Capital. Stay tuned to Radio Info Pro... Shut up! - Well, well. - Hello. Mornin'. What a surprise! So that's why this mutt was barking. Bitch, if you don't quit yelling, I'll eat you alive! I'll show you! So what's with you at this early hour? Can't you sleep? Yes, I can. The girls have gone. Don't say you're looking for me. I am. Come inside. But... You're tired. Why won't you sleep? Wipe your feet. Can you tell me what use I have for... that cupboard? Or this one? Wait till you see the garage: a regular flea market. This is what happens when things go bad. Let me get you a coffee. Some time today? Sugar, one teaspoon or two? Two. Besides the fact that you need sleep, you look good. Yes, here they are. 3350. OK? For 3 months... March, April, May. Won't you count them? I will. Now sit down and drink your coffee. And, come on, man, take your coat off! For God's sake! You'll be cold when you go out. What? Go and sit down. That's it. It's cold. You want me to heat it up? No. Thank God, the girls are alright. And they're not missing you. How is Pusa? How is Pusa?! Pusa is fine. Why don't you give her a call? Why would I? To ask how she's doing, for example. I'll call her. I'm making moussaka. Dan went to drive the girls. You know what I feel most sorry for in all of this? You, dividing up every last inch... what I did for you, and what you did years ago, in kindergarten. This isn't right. This is how you get to crossing the street when seeing someone. Right? I don't know. You tell me. And who is the person? Guess. What's that on your lip? Herpes. Put some toothpaste on. You caught me busy. "And the birdie, in her flight" "Flew all the way to Bihor" "And flew all the way to my house" "And I see my mother and father" "And I see my brother sometimes" "And I see my neighbors" "Because I miss them so much" "All my life, I liked having love close by" "Loneliness is not good" "Whoever doesn't live life as a couple, Is always missing out" "There's no one there for him" Hey, Lenuta, I see we have guests! Where are you? You're starting out a bit early... "Happiness is like a cure" "Listen to my words" "A sad life is never helpful" "What use is being born into the world then?!" "I throw money around without any care" "Because I know what I have to lose" "If I don't live my life now" "I won't ever live it" Is Andreea in? I'm looking for miss Bratila Andreea. Is she in? - Who are you looking for? - Miss Bratila Andreea. - Is she in? - Who are you? - Come again? - I asked who are you. - Who are you?, for that matter. - What do you mean? What kind of question is that? Why don't you simply go and get her? Come back at 10 o'clock and speak to our boss then. Oh, really?! Who are you? I haven't seen you before. Why are you covering for her? Can you tell me that? Why? If you are smart, smart enough and have nothing to hide, why won't you let me in? Come back in half an hour and talk to our boss. - Why won't you let me in? - We have work to do. Please come back later. - You have something to hide? - We have a store to fix. I won't bother you. - Please don't come in! - I'll just sit here quietly and wait for Andreea. What are you looking at? What's wrong with my jeans? Nothing. - So, they're fine. - Yes. - You like them? - Yes. Let's see what you've got here. Please don't mess it up. I'm not. Valentino, Valentino... Go call Emilia. And, besides Valentino... Could you come for a moment, please? Tell me, have you ever thought about why women started wearing pants? Have you? Hello, how have you been? Hello. Well, I was just walking down Calea Victoriei, and I thought I'd stop by and have a chat with Andreea, but I'm out of luck. Sorry, Andreea doesn't work here anymore. - Since about a month ago. - How so? Yes. As far as I know she was trying to get an inspector's job at the Ministry of Finance. Are you making fun of me? No. What's this nonsense about ministries and financial inspectors? It's true. What? What's true? It's true: she hasn't worked here since the end of January. So I guess you suddenly remembered? Which January? Yes. So, since two months ago? Can't you see you're trapping yourselves in your own lies? How can you call me a liar? How can I?! Allow me... Please. Go in and look, if you don't believe us. This is too much! Miss Cati is in there. Do you need to use the bathroom? Does he need to use the bathroom? He doesn't need to use the bathroom. And, if things are the way you claim, why did she say that you won't be in until 10, and, if I look at my watch, and it's quarter to 10 and you're here? Sir, please, leave us alone! We have to tidy up until 10 o'clock. And why do you say, at first, that she left a month ago, and then, suddenly, you change your mind and say that she left at the end of January? Why? Leave you? You want me to leave you? OK, I'll leave you and go. And you know why? Have you considered why? Think about that. Is there a problem? - Excuse me, miss Raluca!? - Yes? Why don't you sell ladies' lingerie? How about it? So you don't have an answer for everything. KINDERGARTEN Turn right and follow the line. Quiet children, and eyes on your plates! Hello, ma'am. Could you... One second. There's no one at Miss Helsighia. She comes in at 12 o'clock. She's working noons this week. I came to get my girl, and... Everyone's at the Ion Creanga theater, seeing The Giant Radish. Come, Lumi. Come on, dear! Go change. This way. We were in mid rehearsal. Really? And I'm disturbing you... What are you doing, taking her? I should say so. What do you think? We were rehearsing for the festivities, you could let her stay a bit more. The festivities? Are you preparing for August 23rd? Could you let her stay a bit more? Mrs. Sofronea... if I were to tell you that I'm in in the terminal stage... would that be enough? Are you being serious? Are you? And you, why don't you come when I call you? Come on kids, let's resume. When I call you, I want you to come. And 1, 2, 3, 4... And why are you looking at me like that? Put more life into it! Bye, Nina! If you don't come at once, I'm leaving you here. I'm coming right now. The water's not running. Forget about that. OK, right away. Please. - Did I tell you we were in a hurry? - Yes. Get dressed. Can you tell me what took you so long? I needed to use the bathroom, and then the toilet wouldn't flush. The first one was: "Alexandru has a new key." The second one was: "Ioana's jacket is new." Did you know that mauve is my favorite color? No. The third one was: The flower... Marina's flower is orange. The fourth one was a question: What color is Andreea's book? And the fifth one was the answer to the question. Andreea's book is... is pink. Who's Andreea? Andreea... is both a girl from our class, and from teacher's book. Teacher has a book for getting words. And I also have a classmate Andreea. - And how do you get along with Andreea? - Very well. She's almost my best friend from the class. Should I give a notice that I'm coming home, each time I'm coming home? No, tell me, should I give a notice each time I'm coming home? I don't know, maybe you'd like me to give a notice 2 weeks in advance. Listen to me: When I come home, I want to be able to get into the house. When I come home, I want to be able to get into the house. Yes. Exactly. Say again? Enough! Enough, I don't want to talk anymore! Enough! Bye! Why didn't grandpa come and get me? - What did you say? - Why didn't grandpa come and get me? Can't you see we can't get into the house? Can't you see we can't get into the house? - What do we do now? - I don't know. Shouldn't you better take me to mom, at work? Is that what you thought? Yes. - Yes, hello. - Hi, is Mrs. Mioara in? - What? - Is Mrs. Mioara in? Yes. OK, I understand. Your hand. You think I can deal with all your messes? You're very much wrong. I gave him that money. There's someone at the door. Is that how you figured it? You give him a little something for the help. What are we doing here? What are we doing here?! The man has a schedule. He'll go and leave you hanging. - Hello. - Just look at him. I invite him to the table and he gets under it. I have something to ask from you. Don't tell me the little one's yours! Yes, she is. How are you, pretty? - What do you say? - Hello. Is she the youngest? No, she's Luminita. The youngest is Lacramioara. Very good. I wish her health. What did you want to ask? Pusa left and locked the door. We can't get in, and I don't know where to leave Luminita. And I wanted to ask you, if possible, to let her stay Here until Pusa comes back. Don't you have the key? I only have the key for the bottom lock. They locked the top also, and left us standing outside. And whose are these? Ours. I see. But I have things to do, and can't keep my eye on her. And I'll have to be going soon. Well... You can have her sit somewhere and do her homework. She won't bother you. I mean, Pusa... I spoke with her. She'll be back in 3 hours. Well, come on then. Come inside. - It's OK? - Yes. Thank you. - Viorel?! - Yes. - How are you? I'm fine. - And how are you? - Fine, fine. Um, what... - What grade are you in? - The first. Yea? What school? At number 139. - And what are these? - Some flowers. - You made them? - Yes. Bravo. You look good, too. I'm here with my nephew... who wants to scam me with some kitchen furniture. He's got a business. So, if I've got a business, I'm looking to scam you?! I know you well. If only I didn't know you just as well. Go on, show me. Three days we've been talking: the money, the money... - Allow me. - OK. No offence, Viorel, but I just finished cleaning. Give 'em here. I'm getting sick of holding a rag all day long. Alright... Instead of that big cupboard... - Aren't you hot? - No. You're hot, right? The air... It's so stuffy in this room. I'll have to let the air in. What are you doing? I'll do all the work for you. Relax, don't bother yourselves. You must be tired. What can we do? That's the situation. I'll leave it here for you, OK? ... and, instead of that, we'll have a table. You can have 4 chairs for it. Eat like regular people. You won't have to be cramped up anymore. The price. I want to know the price. - Excuse me? - Yes. Can I leave this bag here? - Yes, leave it. - OK? It's... How can they be cheaper? Didn't I say I'm only charging for materials? What do you want, then? For me to pay for everything, and then have you buy me a drink in return? Let's come to an understanding. Give me a keg of beer at the end, and that's that. This is the price. - What'll be going in the corner? - The fridge. - You won't forget, right? - How could I forget? Come on. Dinner's ready. You're driving me crazy with your cigarettes. Should I set you a plate? Are you eating with us? Dear, don't rush us. We're coming. Didn't you say you wanted to eat? God, forgive me! Now, what's most important. I almost forgot. Hey... Did this girl of yours eat anything today? Did this girl of yours eat anything today? - Have you eaten today? - Yes. I didn't hear you. - What did you eat? - I had a sandwich this morning, and I had another one at school, and drank my milk. Milk isn't food. I'll give you some boeuf salad. Mrs. Mioara, no. Listen... - Do you pus mayonnaise in it? - Of course I do. Don't give her any. She's allergic to it, and any kind of preservative. I made it in the house, with my own hands. It's fresh. She's also allergic to eggs. - Make sure you don't give her anything with eggs. - OK. - It's serious, you know. - I'll give her something else. Do you want some cherry-brandy? Let's drink some cherry-brandy. No, no thank you. - Leo! - Yes. - Let's drink some cherry-brandy. - I'm driving, thanks. Come on, what's the big deal? I got it: she can't have any eggs. I'll find something else for her, don't worry. Something else. Anything except for eggs. What are we gonna do with this boy? - What? - I need to use the bathroom. How many times a day do you go to the bathroom? - The bathroom's over here, right? - Yes. It's occupied. You should get a job. Just sit here until you can go in. OK? You see them, right? - Your backpack, the gym bag. Don't forget them. - OK. - Don't forget them. - OK. I'm off. Goodbye. Goodbye. Daddy... I don't want to stay here. I don't want to stay here, I want to go to Pusa. Leave your dad alone, he's got business. Listen... I have some gumbo stew with mutton. Can I give her some? Would she have it? What kind of stew? Gumbo stew with mutton. Yes. Yes, give her some. You sit at the table and do your homework. - Miss Mioara will help you, and Pusa returns in 3 hours. - Yes. We'll manage. We'll have a great time together. A great time. - Yes? - Yes. - Thank you very much. - Don't worry. Thank you very much. - You're welcome. - Goodbye. - Bye, daddy. PASTRY DISTRICT 3 POLICE 10TH PRECINCT Your ID card, please. You want me to get you something? Your ID card, please. You don't want anything? - No. - Broke again? Empty your pockets on this desk. Empty your pockets. Give this to me. Come over here. Over here. Place your hands on the wall. Higher. A bit higher. Spread your legs. Good. Could you be more careful? Relax, nothing happened. Sit down here. Sit down. - Was it necessary to rough me up? - Sit down and relax. Nothing happened. Sit down. It's expired. Mister... - It's expired. - Yes, I know. I should have renewed it in July. This is a 12 caliber. Lica! How are you? We're over here. Brats, I'm never getting rid of you, am I? Sir, this way. He had a tough time with it, with the screws from the lit. He needed a mouse wrench. And, when he opened the plastic lid from the motor, you know, the one between rocker cams, he pulled out a hatful of cherry seeds. What? What? Nothing. - Tell me. - Don't worry, finish your work. How they got in there, I don't know. He was even ashamed to tell me. Cherry seeds... I knew you wouldn't believe me. So I told him to keep them so I can show you tomorrow. I knew you wouldn't believe me. - Have you identified the murders? - Yes, 4, apparently. Two men and two women. - What do you say, boys? Should we send someone? - Where? - Coffee? Yes. Do you want some? What, you think we're getting too high class? No, boss, but it's bottled water. I was thinking that a coffee can get expensive this way. Alright. It's more about Giardia infection than being high class. Tap water is riddled with Giardia in all of Bucharest. - Listen up... - All of it! Ask the mechanic to add up again. Ask him nicely to add up once more. Boss, he's an honest man. I wouldn't have stuck my nose out for him if he was some... deadbeat or something. The old man's been fixing his car there for years. The man has his garage in the neighborhood. Go see if there's been any report. Everyone goes to see him, he never gave any reason for doubt. You'd never hear that Petrisor pulled one on him, or something like that. The phone! You always do this. Or should I answer it? Hello. Yes, it's me. Kid, official duty. To Dragnea. Get it sealed and stamped. You know what to do. Hold on. What's his name? - Who? - This mechanic of yours. - Petrisor. Petrisor Valentin. - Alright. Gimme his number. Got it? This is just for your peace of mind. So you don't think that I added a little extra for myself. You always do this. I'm the fool for getting involved. - Nevermind. - I should have known from the start. - Tell me. - He's arrived. - Really? - Yes, he's downstairs. - I'll be back in 2 minutes. - OK. 2 minutes. Let's go. - Can I turn on my cell phone? - Yes, you can. Remain there. - Excuse me. - Yes. Can I move from this chair near the window? There's a terrible draft on this hallway. - There? - Yes, I'm getting a draft on this chair. - Yes, sure. - So I can? Sure. I brought you a coffee. It's got everything it needs. Call me when you finish, OK? Who did you say you killed? The notary public, Zoltan Istvan and Dan Livinski and Rodica Livinski, my in-laws. - Doru? - Yes. Grab something to take notes. Yes. Right away. Tell me once again exactly who the victims were. Tell you their names? - Zoltan Istvan and... - Wait a minute. Ready. Zoltan Istvan... and Dan Livinski and Rodica Livinski. Rodica is... the wife of Dan Livinski, and my mother-in-law. My ex mother-in-law. Of course she's your "ex". Is that all? Yes, there was one more woman. When I shot Zoli in the underground parking lot there was a woman with him, but I don't know her. Zoltan Istvan. And... I don't think she was his wife. They didn't seem close. Is he your relative, too? He's my ex wife's notary. They met 3 years ago at Geoagiu Bai. 4 years as of June. Where did all these killings take place? I shot Zoltan Istvan in the underground parking lot of Intercontinental Hotel yesterday, at about 9, and I shot my in-laws at their home, in Chitila, at 23a Lunca Siretului street. Where do these people live? Who? The victims. My in-laws live at 23a Lunca Siretului street, in the Chitila neighborhood. And Zoltan Istvan has... an apartment on Fainari street, at number 17. It's the street connecting Lizeanu to Mosilor. I don't know if he actually lives there. It's rather a notary office. He has another one in Satu Mare, and another in Debrecen. I don't know about the lady he was with. Why did you kill them? I want you to know I realize that what I'm saying... cannot be qualified as a confession. But... Because you need it for the record, I dunno, declarations and forms to fill out... I'll try to be precise. Yes... Amalia is... Amalia is careless like a child... and she easily... believes... what certain people say... or utter. I didn't get a divorce because I wanted a divorce. Do you understand? And, when you get a divorce, it's not like separating from just a human. I couldn't leave things like that. I don't know what you think, but... I don't personally believe that the justice system has access to the complex relationship between me and my wife. Who's Amalia? Amalia is my wife. My ex wife. Her name's also Livinski now, she assumed her maiden name. What do you do, Mr. Ghenghea? I am a specialized consultant, metallurgical engineer at The Bucharest Heavy Machinery Factory for The Chemical and Petrochemical Industry. And your address? Where I live? No. 5, Fetesti Street. Balta Alba. No. 5, Fetesti Street. Building H27 entrance B, 2nd floor, apartment 18. Building? H27 entrance B, 2nd floor, apartment 18. OK. You're from Bucharest? Yes, I'm from Bucharest. My mother was born in Silistra, in Bulgaria. And my father was born in Tandarei, but I was born here, at Polizu Hospital. I dunno but, I came to the police... surrendered myself and my weapon... and the officer on duty grabbed me by the armpits. I surrendered... isn't it obvious I did it willingly? Yes. I think that this officer didn't understand at all. The man to whom you were speaking earlier. - Any more coffee left? - Yes. Do you have any children, Mr. Ghenghea? Yes, I have 2 girls. What are their ages? The youngest is 4 years old, and the old one is 7, she's in 1st grade. Don't get me wrong, but... I've listened to you and seen the way you think you... know and understand and are perceiving me, and... I'm getting scared. I don't know if you understand me. - Should we get his statement? - I would think so. Yes. I understood. And the others? Our people left? OK. - Well? - It's all real. Take his statement. Here... Write a statement for us. "The undersigned", name, surname, living in Bucharest, born on the date... And so forth. Write down, nice and detailed, everything that happened. If you run out of paper, I'll give you some more. - Can I have a pen? - Yes. Here... A pen with the Steaua FC logo. I'm going to the can.
