WET LIPS (aka COCKTAIL SPECIAL) - Hello - How are you, Eugenie? - Is that you, Martine? - Yes - I wanted to hear your sweet voice. - You're so kind. I called because I want to see you again. That's really great. It could be even better. What are you doing in the next few days? I still don't know. Would you like to spend the weekend at my place? Sure! Why not. I like the idea. First we'll have to settle a couple of things. If you say so. The last time we saw each other, we had a delicate conversation. You admitted to being completely uninformed about sex. You wanted me to bring you - into this scene, so to speak. - Yes. For a writer, it's an honor to be a guide for a fascinating girl like you. Thanks. Do you read my books because they excite you? Yes. You get excited reading my books and I get excited thinking about you. - Really? - Yes, my angel. Lately I've become a bit lesbian. I can imagine. And maybe I am a bit too. When you come, you'll meet my friends and learn their specialities. I confess the idea appeals to me. What's wrong? You're afraid of trying new things, right? Yes But, at the same time, I want to experience them. - So, you'll come? - I don't know. - What would I say to my parents? - Talk to them. You have to come. I want you. At nights I can't sleep anymore. I always think of you. I dream of your body. I dream of kissing you. If you want... I could speak with your father. Yes. - You have to come. - I'll come soon. Come, dear, I'll happily wait for you with my friends and servants. Everyone wants to meet you. You know, I'm not alone right now. I'm playing with Berto. - While his wife licks me. - Yes. But you're the one that truly excites me. Come. Imagine having in your hands what I have. Feel the blood pulsing. Imagine feeling Anna's tongue licking you everywhere... touching you. It's fantastic! Yes. It's getting harder, bigger. My brother Christian is here with us. In my bed. Who is experienced with me. I want him to see you, so come. Come, Eugenie. All of us are waiting for you to join us for a nice weekend. I touched myself. Thinking of me? Yes, of you and the things you told me. - I'll call you again tonight. - Bye, Martine. Who was that on the phone? A friend of mine. Why do you wander around nude? Aren't you ashamed? We're a family, daddy. So what, I'm a man - got it? You're my father. I don't want to see you nude. Is that clear? Come here... closer. Yes, right away. The judgement? You've been bad to your friend and you need to be punished. Yes, certainly. Thank you. You can't expect this from me. Something like that I won't do... I don't want to. Why not? I only want to invite your daughter over. to meet my little brother, that's it. They'll only play with each other. No Would you like to be the hero of my new book? Raymond Raspe, public politician... finally removing his mask... is only a little masochist. You can't do this... no. I do everything I want to. So, she will come? What do you want from her? She's still a kid. I had always enjoyed so much But without arriving at the true pleasure. But finally, that night I discovered all my senses. My mouth sought my brother's orgasm. While I took him between my lips... I felt how it grew... how it hardened. My brother Christian was just 14... but his organ became bigger and bigger between my lips... while my tender, delicate tongue... maneuvered unyieldingly. It exploded and that was the first time I had a neverending orgasm. Stupendous. I begged him to feel safe with me. He kissed me on the mouth and then between the legs. Martine! Martine! - Hello. - Good evening, my love. It's you, Martine. Yes, my angel, with good news. Your father has nothing against your coming here. Are you happy? Oh, Martine, it's really fantastic. I'll pick you up tomorrow morning then. - Thanks Martine. - Sleep well. Where is Eugenie going? - I gave her permission. - But with who? What's the difference? What's wrong? What's wrong? - I'm worried about her. - There's no need. She's passing the weekend with a famous author of novels. You could have at least told me about it first. I want to introduce you... This is Eugenie. - Good morning. - Hello. - Show her to her room. - OK. They're my best housekeepers. Accompany Eugenie to her room. You'll sleep here. It's really nice. Berto, could you fill the bathtub? OK I'm afraid... I'm afraid of women. Why? It was stupendous. Eugenie is a sweet girl, very sweet. Don't be afraid. I love you. She's definitely still a virgin. Her hands are as soft as silk. She'll make you happy, little brother. What are you doing? Berto! Berto, come here. No, don't touch me. I don't want to. Berto. Berto! Don't frighten the little ones, understand? OK. - You need to proceed with caution. - OK. You can't be in a hurry. Good evening, my love. You know Eugenie, you're really pretty. Anna, make a special cocktail. Do you like the cocktail? Very much. - Did you recognise all the ingredients? - No. It's nice that you liked it, you know. Soon, you'll taste things you'll like even more. - Hi Eugenie. - Hi. My name is Sandra. And I'm Carlo. Relax, Eugenie. Relax, c'mon. Let us do everything, dear, you need only relax. - You're starting to like the feeling? - Yes. The most important thing is to release yourself to the pleasure. Attain the heights of love. Experience pleasure without reserve, without restraint, without taboo. Let your imagination run wild, be ready to experience pleasure. Now we'll draw lots. It's time to decide which of you will do it. Sandra... Sandra will lick Martine and Anna. Now, Berto will give us an example of exceptional endurance. My dear sister will be fucked by Carlo. Hold her tight. No! Leave me alone! No! No! I don't want to! Martine! Martine! Come... Come. Martine. Martine, finally! Come here, Martine. Come here. I love you, Martine. Why don't you keep going? C'mon. Don't you want to hang out with us? Aha! Good morning you lovely girls! Hello, Martine. I'm Jovan, and I'd like to go for a walk with one of you ladies. Who's coming? Me! Come here a sec, Christian. We only want to see if you're a man. - C'mon - No! - C'mon - Wait! No! Wait! I beg you! Leave me alone! That's enough! C'mon! This is your big night, Eugenie. Take advantage of it. In this masquerade ball, nobody knows what mask the others have chosen. Choose yours and join them. You won't be recognized by anyone. Good evening, sir. Are you alone? I want my daughter. Eugenie? She left a while ago. - Our party wasn't to her taste. - Where did she go? Don't you want to stay with us? I really want you to. You don't want to join our party? You can disguise yourself. No one will recognize you. I'll offer you the most beautiful woman. - I don't have time to lose. - Come on, don't make me beg. Is she at least sweet? Yes... so you'll stay? Come. I offer you... the most interesting man I've invited. Just like you It's midnight. Take off your masks. Eugenie... it's you! Daddy! She's a good student. A marvel, with a teacher like you. subtitled by Sophia0429 for Cinemageddon
