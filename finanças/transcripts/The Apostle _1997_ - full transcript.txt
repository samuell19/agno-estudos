That you find it in your supreme and holy power to forgive us for our deeds, and to let us carry on your work. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, amen and amen. (PREACHER CLAPPING) CONGREGATION: (CHANTING) Jesus. SONNY: I always called you Jesus. You called me Sonny. Now heal this broken heart. MAMA: Don't you let her have them kids now. Fight for those children, Sonny, you hear me? Mama. JESSIE: Sonny, I don't want to pray with you anymore. HORACE: Sonny, listen, I really and truly am sorry about what's happened here, I really am. JESSIE: I want out of all of this. I just want out, that's all. (CHANTING CONTINUES) SONNY: With great humility, I ask permission to be accepted as an apostle of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ of Nazareth. And with your gracious permission, I wish to be baptized as an apostle of our Lord. I therefore, without witnesses, baptize myself in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. (INHALES DEEPLY) (MAN PRAYING SOFTLY) And in the name of Jesus. I have a first cousin which is a retired pastor. Uh-huh. He fasted once a year. Oh, I understand. He's a good man. I understand. I understand. Where does he reside? He resides in a place called Bayou Boutte. Uh-huh. Where is that, in Texas? It's, uh, it's in Louisiana. Ah, yeah. It's south of here, a few hours. Uh-huh. What's his name? Maybe I heard of him. His name is Charles Blackwell. Charles Black... I know a lot of Blackwells, but I never heard of him. Never heard of Charles Blackwell. I know a lot of preachers, but I don't know Charles Blackwell. Oh, yes, sir. Praise God. You're a blessed man. Thank you, Lord. I'm your apostle now, from now until the end of all eternity. Ever since the day you rung my bell, when I was 12 years old, I've been with you. Sometimes I zigzagged off-course, more zagging than zigging, but I'm gonna tell you, I'm with you now in a straight line forever. I'm your apostle now. In the name of Jesus, you don't have to go back in there, you hear me? In the name of Jesus and the Holy Ghost, you don't have to go back in there. Say 21 times, "Jesus will save me." Jesus will save me. Twenty-one times... (WHISTLING) Hey, wait, wait! Twenty-one times. Don't go back in there now. Don't go back in there. (WHISTLING) Hey! You have Holy Ghost power! Holy Ghost power! MAN: ♪ I'm a soldier in the army of the Lord (PEOPLE CLAPPING) ♪ I'm a soldier in the army ♪ I'm a soldier in the army of the Lord ♪ I'm a soldier in the army ♪ Oh, I believe I'll die CHORUS: ♪ In the army of the Lord ♪ Oh, I believe I'll die ♪ In the army Oh, hallelujah! CONGREGATION: Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Glory! (MAN SPEAKING IN FRENCH OVER PA) Glory. Glory. You do it your way, I do it mine, but we get it done, don't we? (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Yeah. "Bayou Boutte." How you doin'? Real good. (CHUCKLING) Lord, I'm yours. Which way, Lord? You pick. I'll follow... Every step of the way. Yes, sir, every step of the way, every step of the way. Amen. You lead me on. Yes, sir. Excuse me. Is there a hotel, motel around here? You know, bed-and-breakfast, anything like that? There used to be a motel in town called the Red Apple Restaurant. I don't think it's there anymore. I see. Yeah, well... (EXHALES) What's your problem there? Well, I set the points. What about 'em? Well, I set them, and I set the floater. Uh-huh. Let me see that. But it's gotta be somethin' else. You probably got a vacuum down in there. Let's see. Well, your breaker plate's not advancing, see? You see that little old tube there? You know what that's for? What? Well, I'm gonna tell you. It's messed up. You gotta clean it, snip it. Then you put it back in, and your problem's solved. That'll be it. Yeah. Right there. Well, I... I appreciate it. Yep. Yes, sir. I knew it was right in there, but, uh... Well, thank you. Thank you. My pleasure. Thank you very much. Yes, sir. MAN: How's it comin' along down there, Sam? You got that figured out yet? Well, you had a small malfunction in your distributor. We got it fixed as good as new. That's great. It looks like we found ourselves a new mechanic. What do you say? Well, I'm ready if you are. Yeah. You serious? Only if you are. You give me the proper parts, I'll build you any vehicle you want from the ground up. So, where you from? See where I'm standin'? That's where I'm from. Oh, really? Yeah. You name it, I been there. I got a little of everywhere in me. Sound like my first two wives. You get around, huh? (LAUGHING) Yeah, yeah. Yeah, well, I been every state except Alaska and a few foreign countries as well, includin' Mississippi. Mississippi. I like that. Yeah. Well, talk it over with my partner. Now, he knows more about the cars than I do. All right, I will. Thank you. I'll check you later. Any of you people know or hear of a Reverend C. Charles Blackwell... Might live around here somewhere? Uh... I think down that way, sir. This way? Yes, sir. All right, thank you. Mmm-hmm. Pardon me. Does C. Charles Blackwell live up here this way? He lives on the next block. This way? Uh-huh. Thank you. Appreciate it. The house with the pretty flowers. (CLAPPING) Yes, sir? You the Reverend C. Charles Blackwell? Yes, sir. Well, I'm the apostle EF. Believe it or not, the Lord sent me to have fellowship with you, so if you could spare me a minute of your time, I'd greatly appreciate it. Come on in. Thank you, sir. I appreciate that. I had this dream that I'd be meetin' a man such as yourself, and the Lord told me to come right to you. And when he talks to me, I always listen and follow him. Yes, sir, I see. Mmm-hmm. WOMAN: Excuse me. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you, honey. You don't have to get up. You're welcome. Now, in my dream, it appeared that I would talk to you about a church or startin' a church jointly. Talkin' at least never hurt nobody, so I thought we might examine the subject somewhat. You know, reflect on it, you know. Mmm-hmm. Yes, yes. Well, Apostle, I don't minister no more. Now, I'm in touch with some of my people, but, uh, most of 'em are off and joined with other churches. Mmm-hmm. I see. Well, uh... If I was to get with some of those people, and they was willin' to start up a new temple, you know, small, would you be willin' to come along with me and help me in the community? (LAUGHS) Well, there is a possibility. You see, I don't preach no more. Mmm-hmm. Now, I had two heart attacks in six months. When I get up on that pulpit and the spirit start movin' in me, praise God, I... I wouldn't hold back, and I can't do that no more. Amen. I got to take everything a little calmer these days. Praise God. But I'll pray on it. I will. Mmm-hmm. Well, you might consider it, 'cause you know, I set up temples all over, you know, all over. Tell me somethin'. Why should I trust you? Lord knows what you could have been or done in the past. No, sir, we got to look out for the devil, 'cause if he robs you of your babies, he could rob somebody around here of their babies, especially if he followed you down here from wherever you come from. Oh, I... I get it. I get it. Right on. Right on. Now, you say God led you to me and not to anybody else? Yes, sir, I do believe that. Yes, sir. Well, if, in fact, he led you to me, I could accept that. If he didn't, I'm gonna find out soon enough, 'cause he's the one gonna let me know one way or the other. And if he did, then naturally, I'd want to be with you, wouldn't I? Because then, I would be with him, right? So, in other words, if he leadin' you, he got to lead me, too. Well, you put that a lot better than I can, that's for sure. (CHUCKLING) Yeah. Yeah. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna keep my eye on you, and the Lord keep his eye on both of us. And we'll all three keep an eye out for the devil, all right? (LAUGHING) (SHOUTING) Hey! You hand my boot back! (LAUGHING) Good morning. I'm Apostle EF. I'm here to see Elmo. Hey, you. I'm Toosie. Welcome to KBBR. He's up there. I'll just buzz him for you. Course, he may be on the air at the moment. You can sit down if you like. That's all right, no. Can I get you some coffee? No, thank you. No. Workin' hard? (LAUGHS) Hardly workin'. So they slave drivers, are they? Oh, well, no. They keep me pretty busy, but there's lots of lulls, too, you know. ELMO: What you got, Toosie? Oh, a Mr. EF is here to see you. Ah, the apostle. Send him up. Just go on up. Yeah. I'll see you in a bit. It was good to meet you. Yeah, ditto. ELMO: ♪ Mmm, that's why I need ya ♪ Ooh, that's why I love ya ♪ Ooh ♪ That's why I need ya ♪ (HUMMING TUNE) Sir. Well, Apostle. Good to see you this mornin'. How you been? Yes, sir. Good mornin'. Well, pull up a chair. Yes, sir. What can I do for the apostle this mornin'? Well, I'll tell ya. How'd you know I was an apostle? Oh, news spreads. What can I do for you today? Well, I tell ya. I'd like to see about gettin' on the radio for some promotion of a church I'm tryin' to get goin' for the Lord. I have a holiness background, and what I want to know is, had you had any religious spots in the past that you sold to preachers to air on? Yeah, you bet I have. You did. So how'd it work out for the most part? Well, I've had a number of preachers in the past, some good and some not so good. How so? Well, some have been all right, but others, for instance, have skipped town before they paid me. Is that right? Yeah, so I've had to learn the hard way, it's gotta be a pay-before-you-pray deal. That's what I tell everybody. Course, there haven't been that many lately, but it's pay before you pray and that's for those who just lookin' to pass on through. I don't blame you on that. One other thing. No fancy stuff. We don't allow speakin' on tongues. Only the King's English. No speakin' on tongues over these airwaves. I... I understand. I can understand that. So, uh, what kind of preacher are you, anyway? Oh, well, I can preach on the Holy Trinity, Old and New Testament, hell, resurrection. You name it, I can do it. I see. Yeah, I can preach on the devil backwards and forwards. I'll give you about anything you want to hear, but no tongues. Well, sounds good. Sounds good. ELMO: You know, we'd have to come up with some angle of gettin' some money in here while you got the word out over the air. What do you think? SONNY: Absolutely. You know, make ends meet. That's Elmo's place. It is? Yes, sir. Old Elmo, he's all over, isn't he? (BOTH LAUGHING) He's somethin', that guy. He's got his fingers in almost everything, I guess. That's your house, huh? Yes, sir. Yeah, that's it. Where'd you learn about cars? Cars? Whatever I know, I learned from my brother. He used to race them out at Fresno, California, so anything I know, he taught me. My brother Robbie. He really is an expert. Well, that ain't no race car or nothin', but that's it, right there. Yeah. looks like you could get someplace in a hurry in it, though. (LAUGHING) Well, it ain't goin' nowhere right now. It's just pretty much sittin' there, I guess, but I plan to get it... It's got a 350 in it and... Looks good. Looks like you know what you're doin'. Well, I... I been tryin', you know? I been workin' for about four years now. By the way, I'm EF. The apostle EF. But people do call me EF. I... I'm Sam, EF. Nice to... I'm not gonna put you out here? You got enough room? Yes, sir, I got plenty of room. Don't even worry about that. Just me out here, so... I appreciate it. Your welcome. But I wanna paint it black, and, um, and everything. You like it? Yeah, I do. SONNY: Lord, I'm not mad, and I'll never be mad at you ever again. I know you're leadin' me. You led me right to this man Sam. He's a nice little fella and a good little fella, and I know you love him tonight, just as I know you love me. So whithersoever thou leadest, I will follow. BROTHER BLACKWELL: Well, there she is. I pastored here over 27 years, till my health broke down. SONNY: Where's everybody gone to, your flock? Oh, they all spread out or gone on. Yeah. I don't know if you'd want it or be interested in it. It's just a thought. Uh-huh. Want it? I'd fight 10 men over it. I would. (LAUGHING) Glory. Glory. I tell ya. Let me tell you somethin'. Hold on now. Hold on. Yeah, but here's what I'm gonna need. All right now. Resurrection time. Resurrection time. I need about, what? I'd say about 29, 30 gallons of white paint, about five gallons of another color for trim. I need cement lathes, mortar sand, you name it. And the roof needs a... You know, a fair amount of material for the roof, obviously, but we'll get her done. I think I can get her done, yes, sir. It'll come out of my first two paychecks, third, if necessary. Yes, sir. Now, there ain't no rent 'cause it belongs to me. Well, bless you. There are a few back taxes due, though. That's all. Really? Well, I can get another job, I have to. I'll get another job. I can set these churches up in my sleep, no problem. (LAUGHS) No problem. You move faster than any man I ever seen. Well, when I was young, I tell everybody I quit school 'cause I didn't like recess. Yeah. Yeah. Now look. This is somethin' here. Let me see now. You got you a good foundation here. Yes, sir. Let's see on the inside. You got no lock. No lock. Yes, sir. Hold on now. Hold on. (ECHOING) Whoa! I mean, I could do some shoutin' in here! Yes, sir. This here's a shoutin' church. I'm gonna shout some for the Holy Ghost. Ha! Boy, I... Well... I mean, that'll do me just fine, if you're sure. Oh, I'm positive. That'll do me fine. It's yours. Yes, sir. Well, bless you. You a good man. Glory be to God. Praise him. Oh, glory. Praise him. Glory. Glory. Well, God bless you, and have a good day, all right? Snow cone? We don't have no snow cones. Snow cones are down the street, all right? Wait. Hold on. Here you go. Here you go. Lollipop. (CHUCKLING) No snow cones, though. (ZYDECO WALTZ MUSIC PLAYING) (ALL HOOTING) (BAND SINGING IN FRENCH) (CROWD CLAPPING RHYTHMICALLY) Good amigo, friend Joe. How are you? JOE: Sonny. Yeah. How's it goin'? Good, good. So, uh... You know Horace ain't doin' too good. You hold it against me, don't you, Joe? No way, Sonny. I might have done the same thing myself. I just want you to be all right, 'cause I love you. (STUTTERING) Well, you say he's still in a coma? The whole church is prayin' for him round the clock in one-hour shifts. Yeah. The police have questions? Maybe I shouldn't call you anymore for a while. Maybe for a while. They came by and asked me a bunch of questions. I told 'em I didn't know where you are, which is the truth, actually. Let me ask you somethin', Joe. How come I hadn't been able to get a hold of Mama? I tried quite a few times, and there's no answer. I been meanin' to tell you. What? Your mother's not doin' too well. She's admitted in the hospital. I didn't know how to get hold of you. What's wrong, Joe? I don't know what it is, Sonny. It's somethin' to do with her kidneys, I think. Uh-huh. Well, now, what's the telephone number? What hospital is she in? No, I can't give you the number, Sonny. You can't be callin'. Them switchboards, the police is all over them. Okay. Would you go visit her for me, Joe? Would you do that, son? I visit her every day, Sonny, you know I do and I will continue to. Yeah. Well, I'm gonna go now. I love you, son. God bless you. You toein' the line? Yeah, I am. Yeah, God bless you, son. Gettin' back at me, Lord, ain't ya? Gettin' back at me. Give me Mama. (SONG ENDS) (CROWD CHEERING) SONNY: You know, Reverend Blackwell, one of these days, I'd like to start me an orphanage. What do you think? Well, one thing at a time, Apostle. Yeah, I know, I know. Maybe a year from now or somethin' like that. I'd like to do somethin' for the homeless and the fatherless, 'cause when Satan robs you of your children or separates you from your mama, it makes you want to truly help others. It really does. Yeah, well, it all takes money. We'll get there. It all takes time. I know. We'll try to create a little local interest on the radio. Elmo's gonna plug us and also the newspaper. We have a newspaper, don't we? BROTHER BLACKWELL: Oh, yeah. Extra, extra, read all about it. Holy Ghost man is here right now. The Jesus people is here. (LAUGHING) Yeah. Yeah, Lord's movin' in me, tellin' me things. What do you think, baby? Huh? Lord's movin' in me. Movin' it all. (CHUCKLING) Lean on that brush, Sam. I'm leanin'. (BROTHER BLACKWELL LAUGHING) Well, I'll tell ya. We can have dinner on the ground. We play softball, I pitch a pretty mean curveball. Play the Methodists. Sell some tickets. Get some good publicity. Don't get so far ahead of yourself now. (LAUGHING) We'll show 'em. We'll show the community that the Holy Lord is here to stay. Yeah, praise God. (ENGINE STARTING) Can't get rid of us. Can't get rid of us. Mmm-hmm. Yes, Lord. SONNY: I'm preachin' like I'm goin' to war this mornin'. I got on my war clothes. I'm preachin' like I'm goin' to war this mornin'. I'm a genuine, Holy Ghost, Jesus-filled preachin' machine this mornin'. I tell you, I'm a genuine, Holy Ghost, Jesus-filled preachin' machine here this mornin'. Now if God be for us, who can be against us? He's God here in this radio station. He's God in Georgia. He's God in Tennessee. He's God in the pulpit. He's God at the front door. He's God in the 7-Eleven. And yea, though I walk... I say, yea, though I walk... "I say yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death," "I will fear no evil, for thou art with me." And why, why, why do I say this? Oh, why, why? Because I got Holy Ghost power here today. We gonna have a Holy Ghost explosion. We gonna short-circuit the devil here today, and the Holy Ghost is our power line to heaven. I'm gonna tell you right now. In days of old, Moses went up into the mountain. When he got up in the mountain, high, high, high on the mountain, the Lord God above gave him 10 commandments. He didn't give him 11 or 12 or 13 or 14. He gave him 10 commandments, and the 11th commandment... Thou shalt not shout, does not exist. How'd I do? Did I do all right? (SHRIEKING) Well, it seemed you did fine to me. Oh, yeah. I've never heard anyone speak like that. You never did? No. The preachers I heard, they more or less talk. Praise God. I was actually fascinated by it. Well, when we're ready, come on over to our church sometime. I guarantee you, you won't see nobody sittin' on their hands. Will you, Brother Blackwell? Not too many. I don't believe in goin' to no church in the morgue. I can believe that. We're not the frozen children. (LAUGHING) Yeah, well, seriously, though, I'd like to get you out to dinner sometime before church. That way, you won't get scared off. I promise you, I promise you, I'll be quiet at you across the table, okay? Well, that might be nice. We'll see. We'll talk about it. Well, I gotta get back to work. All right. We'll see you. Bye-bye.

Oh, my husband got a good offer on the offshore crude lines. Your husband. Whoo-hoo, that's the end of this deal, isn't it? Huh? Ho-ho! No. No, we're, kind of, separated at the moment. Oh, Lord, please let it work in my favor. (LAUGHING) You have any kids? I have two boys. They stay with my mother. Where at? Bowling Green, Kentucky. Oh. You ask a lot of questions. Do I? I guess I do. You know, I've evangelized there a time or two. Oh, yeah. It seemed to me, there were a lot of preachers come through there when I was a girl. Well, I could have been one of 'em, but it's been a while. You have any children? I have a boy and girl. It's my beauties. I call 'em my beauties. Where do they live? They live a long ways from here, same as yours. Yes, ma'am. Yep. You miss your babies a lot? Yes, I do. Oh, well, they're... They're not exactly babies anymore, but, uh... Yes, I do miss them. So... (STUTTERING) You think I'm a good date? What do you think? What do you mean? How am I doin' so far? (LAUGHS) Ah. Well, you're not supposed to ask that. I'm not? No! You're supposed to let the evening develop on its own... Draw your own conclusion. You think? Yeah. (CHUCKLING) I wouldn't have gone out with you if I didn't think you... Oh.

Lord, let this church live. Just, uh, pray you let Horace live. In the name of Jesus, let him live. I don't know how long it's gonna last, Lord, 'cause they could be comin' for me... 'Cause they comin'... But in the meantime, we've done something, haven't we? We've done somethin'. I want to thank you for that. I really do. Good night, Jessie. I love you, and I'll always love you. Good night, Toosie. This is the day that the Lord hath made. BOTH: Let us rejoice and be glad in it. Thank you for the support, brother. I appreciate every bit of it.

This is his home. If this isn't his home, we'd better go on home ourselves and lock this place up, because we'd better always be ready to make God welcome... ALL: Amen! ...in our house of worship, because this is his home. Glory be to God. Amen! Amen. I also want to say I'm not gonna take any tithes and offerings today. That'll be next week.

I know if you felt 300 or 400 volts of the Holy Spirit, then I know you're gonna want it. Do you wanna get plugged in? WOMAN: Yes! Come on. Do I hear somebody say, "Amen"? ALL: Amen! Somebody get plugged in, you might get three in the one, the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost. That's a mighty high-cost baptism! (ALL SHOUTING PRAISES) Hey! Now if you wanna go for it, be saved. Folks will be saved. If God sent his only son, then he's worth it. Praise his name! Did you want to be on the devil hit list? ALL: No! Do you want to be on the devil's hit list? No! Then you better get on Jesus' mailing list. (SHOUTING) You better get on Jesus' mailing list. Glory! Put all the enemies and the devil behind you. Work on it. Get rid of all the combined Satanic forces, and get right with God here tonight! This ain't no parish subject. This is the Holy Ghost power we're talkin' about. Yes! Get the Holy Ghost power. You want to have a Holy Ghost explosion? ALL: Yes! We're gonna short-circuit the devil tonight. We're gonna short-circuit the devil tonight. You devil, get behind me. You stay there. You stay there. You stay there. You stay. Oh, you stay there, devil. Oh, you stay there, devil. You stay there. You stay there. Oh, my, my, my. Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my, my. We're gonna meet Jesus tonight. Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my, my. We're gonna be with Jesus tonight. Oh, we're gonna be with Jesus tonight. Can somebody say, "We're gonna be with Jesus tonight"? (SHOUTING PRAISES) Say it again. "We're gonna be with Jesus tonight." Let all the people out yonder on Pecan island hear you. We're gonna be with Jesus tonight! ALL: "We're gonna be with Jesus tonight!" (SONNY SHUSHING) (CONGREGATION MURMURING) (WHISPERING) Praise God. Now look at these beautiful, beautiful little hands. Look at 'em. Now imagine a nail piercin' the palms of this child's hands. CONGREGATION: No, Lord, no! And then picture the nails goin' into an old board... If you was to take two boards and nail 'em together... MAN: Mercy! I know I don't have that much love in me, to do this to my son. Do you? WOMAN: Oh! SONNY: I know I don't. I don't have that much love in me. Amen! But God does. Amen! (ALL APPLAUDING) God does. Bless you. Bless you. Thank you. Put your hand over your heart. Your other hand, reach out and touch somebody. The Holy Ghost can and will enter you, but there's yet another side to this issue. On the other side of the Holy Ghost explosion is a still, small voice... The still, small voice of Jesus within you, in your heart, talking to you, leadin' you. ALL: Hallelujah. Leadin' us on. This powerful, quiet force can penetrate the most callous and hardhearted atheist you'd ever wanna meet. (SHOUTING PRAISES) The onliest place the still, small voice of Jesus Christ cannot enter, is into the heart of any man or woman who says, "No, you cannot come in." WOMAN: Mm-hmm. Mercy! "You cannot enter here tonight." Mmm-hmm. Not gonna say that. SONNY: Glory. WOMAN: Hallelujah. Amen. MAN: Glory! I want every head bowed, every eye closed. (ORGAN PLAYING) Is there anyone here who wants to come forward and accept our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, as his personal savior? Let him do so now. Once you're saved, it's a done deal. WOMAN: Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Can you say, "I'm set flat on ready tonight"? For any mother's son or daughter who wants it, it's here tonight. Oh, yeah. Jesus is here. Jesus is here. It's a one-way road to heaven. One-way road to God! Jesus is waiting, and the Holy Ghost conductor is callin', "Board! All aboard!"
