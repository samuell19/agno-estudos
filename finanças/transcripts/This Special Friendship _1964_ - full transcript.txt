This film takes place in an already distant time. The story it tells could not happen today. Discipline is no longer as severe in colleges, and the education methods are very different. But what will never change, what remains eternal, are the emotions which test the threshold of adolescence - THIS SPECIAL FRIENDSHIP Be a man, my son. Remember Bonaparte. When they asked him who he was... He answered: "A man". Is the car the 8 or the 10 H.P.? The 10. All right, pay up! You're a new boy? I've not seen you before. Second form. Me too. What's your name? Georges de Sarre. Lucien de Rouvière. No, just Rouvière. You haven't been here before? No, but my parents thought... Well, you'll find it tougher. Up at 5.30 prayers then mass. Breakfast at 7.30. Recreation. Classes... Supper, reading and bed. Are you clever? I've won prizes. I'm only good at maths. Want me to pass you the answers? Why not? And I'll... And you'll do the rest. "Skylark"... "Skylark, pretty skylark... I'll pick your brains..." - You're there? - Yes, side by side. It wasn't for you. You'll soon learn how to do it for yourself. Thank you, Sister. Let us give thanks to God. We'll have another bet. Why? You don't know anything about cars. I do too! Well, I'll keep the money. Marc de Blajan. Georges de Sarre. The Marquis de Sarre? He's my father. I understand. What are you good at? I got first prize. Me too. You must join the Academy. What do you have to do? Get 16/20, 4 times running. Maybe I will. It's either the Congregation or the Academy. I don't much care... for the Children of Mary. They're always running away. I can help you get into the Academy. I'd like that. Are you in the Academy? The place stinks... Pedantry and pretentiousness. Have you chosen your confessor? No. Who's yours? The 4th on the left. Father Lauzon. I'll have him too. He'll be pleased. To remain pure, or rediscover purity again, watch and pray. For prayer is the saving grace. For the enemy spies upon us, seeking our destruction. Beware of your friendships. Let them be pure. Your sensibility held firmly in rein, that your friendships should be public, and friendships of the soul. Tomorrow is St Placide's day. He was saved from drowning by a friend whose faith bore him above the waters. Pray to St Placide for holy friendships... to save you from evil. Pray to deserve, like him, the Supreme Friend who will give you an eternal reward and to whom you can say in the words of the "Imitation" "You are really my beloved". Ferron's all right. How do you mean? I mean he plays well. To play well doesn't mean he's all right. What do you mean? People are "all right", and not so. You choose. What do you mean by these terms? I mean the pure and the impure. And Ferron is one of the impure? Rather! Why? Ask Rouvière. What about Rouvière? I don't know. Ask Ferron. Thanks. You've hurt yourself? Thanks. It's dirty! You and your clean linen. See this blood? It's mine! Last year, Ferron and I exchanged blood. Oh, yes? We made a little cut and licked each other's blood. Then you're joined for life or till death. It's rather nasty! You don't understand. You'll see: "Ferron and Rouvière". I've found a way out. Ferron, Rouvière, you're wanted at the Office. Father, I haven't finished. You're wanted, not your opinion. Get on with it! "17th August for you" André Ferron. Do you remember the day, my dear... When the flowers became stars in the night? We'd played tennis together, And now in the thinning light, While the sky faded away, Desires whispered within, And remembered kisses scented, That unforgettable day, Don't you remember that dark way? Don't you remember that dark way? So it was a love poem? Yes. And you enjoyed it? Yes. Didn't you feel ashamed? Yes, I still do. Have you shown this poem to anyone? No, Father, no one. Where did you read it? I didn't... It's handwritten. I don't know how you got hold of this. But let me tell you: It's not enough to avoid those who do evil. Others have to be protected from them. I don't like Black Sheep. But they exist And they've to be kept out of the flock. Understand... Your conscience and heart will tell you if this is an evil which may affect others... Or just an incident, as I hope it is... But I can't decide. Pray for God's guidance. Isn't he there? He told me to wait. You've heard of St Tarsicius? He was slain because he wouldn't surrender the wafer. I've never heard of him as a child martyr. Wise remark! It makes St Tarsicius all the younger. He was between 20 and 25 when he was stoned. I've asked for this interview. My parents send their regards. You must be terribly busy. I've kept you waiting. Later, you can enter the Collegium Tarsicius. One of your friends can no longer stay here. He goes back home tomorrow. Such a sin cannot be tolerated... Licentiousness of mind, if not of conduct, is incompatible with the Christian conscience. I acted to defend you. Think of your comrade as he in solitude is thinking of you. Try to understand and remember him in your prayers. Lucien, listen! You can't understand. I do. But don't be scared. I'm thinking of him. Of me too. Why should you? Don't say that... The whole thing's our fault. How do you know? I'm sure. He'd sent me a poem I've lost. That must be it. Was your name on it? No. Andrй wouldn't give you away. Are you crazy? But others would. There's no reason to be afraid. I've seen the Superior. We've to serve his mass tomorrow. He said that? Yes, to bless our budding friendship. But look! What? It's a miracle! What are you doing? It's the hand of God. I who was unworthy am saved. What's that? I'm not up to much good. You know very well. 10.35 pm. I'm converted. Bring us French fries, And not cabbage, Or half-raw meat. "May Georges be converted" Who is he? You'll find out. With a hammer? The hammer of the Scots. What year? - I don't know. - Well, you'll learn. - Whose turn? - Your turn. This'll be tough. Look up, look down. Yes, I see it. Don't move. It's the train that's moving. - Am I hurting? - No. It was a big one! Thank you. All right, come in! - Is it a man? - No. - A woman? - No. - A child? - No. Make room there! - An animal? - Yes! Famous? - No... - More or less... Living? We would know... An animal that is famous and still alive... - A real animal? - Yes? - It's not Pegasus? - No! That's it. You've got 3. I simply asked was it Pegasus. - How many feet? - Four. Does it go fast? It trots along... What colour? That's not a question. - It's the lamb I carried yesterday. - Yes. - You know my brother? - This is your brother? This is little Alexandre. And this is the son of the Marquis de Sarre. Who's always top. And will soon be a member of the Academy. SECOND TERM Lousy holidays! My brother was ill and my father mad! What did you do? Nothing... There were always my brothers and sisters. I saw "Polyeucte" with the Comedie Franзaise. With? Well, there was one of them. Why has he been punished? He was playing the fool. He told the inspector he'd given his ticket away. I've seen Andrй again. - What did he say to you? - Nothing special. How is he getting on? He's bored at school. I've lost my Faith. All the medals and what-nots scaled off me. - You're not surprised? - No. I did right? Yes. What time was it? 4.32 pm... When is a palace a port? A palace a port? Yes. When? When it's Southampton. Oh, that's smart. Without lifting your plate! Watch out! Nor did his comrades dare to be dissolute. And when they saw him draw nigh, they said... Silence! Here is Bernardin. When a noble made a dishonourable proposition... Bernardin, carried away in righteous wrath... Struck him... You've got to eat. The noble, become the laughing-stock... withdrew... But this led to repentance. He went to hear St Bernardin preach... And burst into tears. Before we pass to the "Imitation", I've some pleasant news. Your colleague, Georges de Sarre, in the 2nd form... has been admitted to the Academy... for the excellent compositions... he has handed in. Georges de Sarre. No, your columns look as if stuck there all alone. Look, a column has no end. It goes on through arch and vault. The Greek column is different... It has more "personality". Because there's no vault in Greek architecture. However, you're asked to draw a vault... Draw columns in keeping... Who is it to? Guess... And you're even writing him verses! On this heart which sought you, my beloved, Lay your head first softly. Like a perfume. Not bad... A pity it's Edmond Rostand. I didn't say... It doesn't matter since he won't know. I'll sign it. A plagiarism... Well, if it's found I'll be expelled. Isn't he like him? Very. Not at all... Congratulations! You've good taste. That's rare at your age. The face of a child or an angel. Or a child... Hey! Thank you. Thank you very much. Don't mention it. These Red-Skin tactics are sad... I'll tell you a secret... If you want to meet in peace, there's a place no one ever goes... Andrй and I always met there... It's smashingly quiet here... I can hear your heart beating... - Beating fast... You ran? - No. It always beats fast? It's because I've written some verses. To thank you. Let me see them. Not so good as yours. I'm in the 4th. Georges, thank you for your pretty lines. I think of you at all times. I work hard in the 4th, and we'll be together next year. We'd enjoy that since I love you, and you like me. They're very, very good. No, there's a line wrong. Which? Since I love you and you like me. Should be: "Since I love you and you love me". Well, why not write it? I can't be familiar with an Academician. Of course you can... - I may? - You may. "Since I love you and you love me". - Never been here? - No. It's really quiet. Yes, we're quite alone. It's made for us. Yes, we'll come back often. Every time. How did you find this place? Lucien Rouvière, who sits beside me... said no-one comes here. You spoke about me? But he's a friend! A friend? And me? You can't have two friends. Only one. To your sins in general, Sorrowfully return. But weep and wail especially... For your everyday sins... And if time permits, Confess to God, in secret, your weaknesses And all your miseries. Moan and scourge yourself for being... So worldly and earthly. So caught by your passions, By the lusts of the flesh... Unvigilant over your senses. Look how he sleeps... His closed eyes seeing angels. Don't pretend to be asleep my little man. What can our inseparables have to talk about, so late? Nothing, just idle talk. Yes, but what about? Just nonsense. The nonsense stopped short. People talk late about serious things. Your beds being close together is the proof. I'd noticed. I notice a lot. But since you're both so wide awake, come with me and we'll talk a little. I'll wait for you. Come in. Sit down. Come nearer. Everyone's asleep but we needn't wake them. It's a fascinating thing, archaeology. It's my worldly profession, as you know. I confiscated these from one of the boys. So we're keeping them in the family. Yes, a fascinating thing, archaeology. We remake a temple from fragments... We decipher an inscription when many words are effaced... You don't mind the 3rd light? Unlike most men, I apply my science to life. Here, from a gesture, or from a flicker, I decipher everyone's secrets. Come closer. You know Greece? No, Father. You will, you deserve it. You'll see where perfection was born... and which is perfection itself... The sea... the sky... the stones... Even a spring... Beauty and purity united for once in time... Can it be so with men? Why not? Why not, indeed? But does purity worry you? Every day? My confessor deals with that. For me too. Of course, of course... But you don't tell everything... He lets you off lightly and you're glad... Not glad but reassured. Even the good, as Scripture says, sin 7 times a day. And what of children who aren't like the good? Such attention is beyond boys of your age. You need a watchful eye on your hearts. Shall I be that eye? - If you like, Father. - Of course, Father. Tomorrow I say mass at the high altar. And I could have 2 choir boys. Lucien Rouvière and Georges de Sarre. - Thanks a lot. - Thank you, Father. A joy to give you the Eucharist. You'll wish to make a full confession before Communion? Forgive me, Father. I'll serve your mass gladly, but confession's useless. A state of grace will come. You refuse? My conscience is clear. We've communion every day. Every day. What reasoning! I know well enough that you confess anything! Make fools of your confessors, not of me! Go to bed. With your purity! Children are like cats, mistrustful and unloving. But you can't help loving them. You'll pray for me? You've waited! It wasn't easy with Lauzon. You've read my note? Smell it? I recognize it. My hair, your lavender. Lauzon spoke about lavender. Why? He said my hair was too scented. But he noticed nothing at confession yesterday. His nose is blunt. Don't believe that. He's not stupid. No, stay there. I like it better. What did he say? When I say he's not stupid it's because he asked me questions... And not silly ones. What questions? You know the prayer for repulsing evil thoughts? Yes, why? I've to read it. But you've no evil thoughts. Do you know what you ought not to know? Yes, I know. Is it interesting? I'm not interested. - Truly? - Truly. I'm glad. You know, I was almost afraid! "If your words were caresses," "My looks were kisses." You wrote this? Yes, Father. Strange literature! Where did you dig it up? Out of a book. I'm surprised. He copied nothing. What book? From La Rochefoucauld. Leave La Rochefoucauld out, please... And no insolence. You're the author of this masterpiece. And you aspire to the Academy! That's the wrong road. Who was this note meant for? No-one! Alexandre Motier, you belong to the Congregation. You realise this ill becomes a Child of Mary. I ask again, whom was it for? But, nobody. If you lie to save... a friend, it's useless. We know whom it concerns. I wish to hear the name from your lips. So? You can't know. It's no-one. We'll say no more. After Easter, I'll ask your parents to take you away. Alexander... From now till then, penitence. You can't kneel forever! I must. They want me to denounce you! Your knees hurt? Yes, quite a bit. It doesn't matter. It's their interference I hate. After all, it's we who pay them! What harm does it do them what we write? You know what it is? They're mad that we don't tell them. - Watch out! - Nothing else! Where's Lauzon in this? He's furious. It appears I'm a great sinner... A great liar, a scandal even, so he says... Know what he's thought up next? Forbidden me communion! He hasn't the right! No! Do you know what I said? I said I'd write to the Pope! I'm not afraid of him... But the others? Afraid, no, but... Look, Alexandre, I must think... You haven't asked what I wrote... Sorry... what did you write? There was: "If your words were caresses... "My looks were kisses." Isn't it good? Very. But this is serious. It certainly is. But if they expel me, you'll leave too? Yes, of course... They won't expel you. Come in. Why are you here? I know, excuse me, Father. I made an excuse to leave prep. It was absolutely necessary to see you. "Absolutely"? And why? A friend's being punished because of me. Alexandre Motier. Father, the note he wrote was to me. Sit down. I'm listening. He would like to enter the Academy. When did you meet him? When he came to see his brother. Louis Motier. I said I'd help him for the Academy. I even said, stupidly, that my talk the other day was meant for him... "Lovingly," I said... And he's taken it seriously... I realise that such remarks are in bad taste. The child must have listened to me with... I don't know... an interest... He writes to thank me... And there it is, Alexandre naturally won't say my name... I thought I owed you the truth. We must always speak the truth. You've had other notes? From the child? Me? No, Father. Please let me see your wallet. But I've no letters! Don't be offended. You should have no secrets at your age. Last year's identity card. A travel folder... My parents were going to Scotland... Then we didn't go... A card showing my weight. My cousin. I believe you. That's our house. Yes Father, that's Anatole France. You know I suppose, his books are banned. I've only read one. Stop there. All right, take all this. I think this business is just childishness. Natural enough on Motier's part. More surprising on yours. Let this be a lesson. Keep to friends of your age. Young imaginations are quickly fired. In conclusion... Firstly, congratulations on being scrupulous enough to come. But, you came without leave and must be punished. You'll be kept in on Sunday. Thank you, Father. That's what I was waiting for. - How did it go? - All right. It's easy to fool them. De Sarre. What did they say at the infirmary? I wasn't there. Where were you? Seeing the Superior. Without permission? You'll be kept in on Sunday. The Superior has arranged it. The last Sunday before Easter. The Superior's order will do for me too. For another reason. For having spoken... to a younger boy. I stand up to them... You want to arrange things. When I can... without giving in. I'm not reproaching you... And as you're older, you're certainly right. I think so, believe me. Of course, I'm happy. You don't look it. No, I'm not happy. But that doesn't matter. I'd like us to exchange blood. So that even if later we don't agree or act alike, it doesn't matter. You're right. "United forever" this is called. I know. Done it before? You do this only once. No, I... Oh, Father, let me sleep. I'm sleepy. You'll fall over again quickly. - Dreaming? - Don't know. I know who you were dreaming of. I don't understand. Georges, my friend. I'm neither blind nor a fool, you know. When you were reading in the refectory this evening, how many glances did you exchange with this child? He blew kisses while eating his soup. You don't skate on thin ice with me. Why then hide your secret when I know it? Didn't? He may be more forthcoming. How? I may soon be his confessor, I think. I doubt it! It should reassure you... not increase this odd mistrust... His soul, at least, will be in my hands. And safer than in yours. He'll never agree. His brother thinks so. Does he want us to go to him? - No. - Good. It was about Alexandre. You think that's funny? Who's there? Who's there? Open up. It's an order! Why is this pupil here? He asked me to confess him. Go back to your bed. De Sarre. You shan't see me after Easter. I think you know why I'm leaving this place. Yes, I know. Thank you for not lying. I'd no reason to. That's all I had to know. What will you do now? Don't worry. Have no remorse... I take it on me... But remember what I said one day or one night... "You must pray very often for me" You're worthy of it. THIRD TERM Why is the greenhouse shut? Don't know. We're fine here. It's not working out. My parents won't go to Brittany. You'll tell me where you're going. And I'll go. We shan't be apart. No, but you're wet. Take this off. Comb your hair and don't be angry. We'll go to your place... We'll spend the summer together. - You swear? - Do I need to? No. How did you come? I said I'd sprained my ankle. It isn't easy... Does it hurt? No. It was a good imitation. I've still got the mark. Mine has nearly gone. Do you want it to disappear? No. Do you? I wanted to keep mine. - No. - No. It's better here. There's room for both of us. We'll have wonderful holidays. The 15th of July. Remember? Your birthday? What shall I give you? Nothing. "Alexandre gave him nothing." You're right. I'll give you nothing. That's nice. And next year... you won't be kept back. I've been working like a slave. We'll be together. I'll help you. Thanks. I can play the piano. You're better than me. The piano... Luxury cigarettes! They're Egyptian. Father Trennes gave them to me. Didn't I ever tell you? - What? - He wanted to be my confessor. Yes, so I heard. And then he left. Do you know why? An argument with the Superior, they say. He was kind of a madman. I thought you liked him. Let's not talk about him. I don't care if you don't. Fair exchange, and I'll know your thoughts. I think of everything. Wretches! Go back! Yes, Father. And you took communion this morning! And this poor child...! - Father, don't... - You're going to lie! Go! - Rhythm! - I'm sorry. Who's there? Nobody, Father. That'll do for today. Can I stay and practise? If you like but you're no good. Thank you, Father. - Each hand separately... - Yes, Father. Are you crazy? I know it by heart. Want us to be caught? It's already done. This isn't the time. Aren't you glad? Of course! How did you do it? I played the invisible man! Are you so watched? Lauzon has us on the brain... But the brain's not so brainy... Rhythm! There's been nothing since? What about you? It'll come. Expelled! Are you scared? No, but afterwards? Afterwards? Once we're under lock and key... To meet again... But none of that matters... We'll meet again and go away. Where? It doesn't matter... Both of us together. - Won't that be nice? - Very. - You're right. - I always am. "Always" is a lovely word. It's easy to be brave... if you aren't scared. Come in. What do you want? To talk to you, Father. There's nothing to say. Go. Appearances aren't everything. Appearances? You mean what I saw? Your piety's a mere appearance. Hear my confession. All your confessions have been false. Let me talk to you! Listen to me, Father! I shan't lie any longer. I did in the past. My confessions were untrue... I saw Alexandre. In secret. I sent him notes, and he did to me. I had evil thoughts. I was wrong... Only, and this is what matters... Alexandre wasn't responsible. My evil thoughts left me as soon as I knew him... Friendship made me forget the rest. Do what you like! I don't care. No, it isn't... I'll hear your confession. Go in peace. Do me one thing, don't come back here next year. Have you thought? Have you nothing to say to me? Georges and I are one. Listen, my son. But look into the future... You like this place... You know how sad I've been not to see you here... What would your parents think? I don't think. Aren't you unhappy? No, I'm not. And neither is Georges. You know I'm going to expel him? Me too? No, not you. I want to keep you with us. What did he tell you? A lot. You've nothing to reproach yourself with. Neither has he. I know what he's decided. I know he wanted to keep me here... But I don't care, nor does he. Since we're going to be friends forever. Really? You know that? I'm sure. Then it's a question of discipline. The Superior must be informed. Come on. Yes, Father. The Cardinal is much better. He'll be at the prize-giving. Oh, I'm pleased to hear that. That is good news. Don't be weak... Come on. Sit down, sit down. Eat, eat. I was harsh the other day. Besides, you deserved it. I had to test you. And you got through the test. Though expelled I'm glad you've seen the light again. It's thanks to you. So we've solved... the problems dividing us. - You'll come back next year. - Oh, Father. Let's not count our chickens. Eat, eat. There's something else. Your partner hasn't repented... Oh, no. Alexandre? He's even become a rebel. I'll have to expel him. I don't want to see him punished... and me forgiven. I expected you'd say that. But you can't be friends. Make the sacrifice. You're asking too much, Father. I'm going to ask still more. - Georges, you must help me. - Of course, Father. Wait, it's hard. Satan wants him. I've fought against it. But you're the cause of it. Because he doesn't understand your feelings... Georges, my child, I can't tame him unless all is over between you. It's up to you. I don't understand. I must give him back... all the letters you received from him. That's impossible, Father. I didn't ask whether it was possible. It's a "must". Suppose I simply destroy them? Stop pretending! He's got to understand that your past is dead. Even if you're unhappy... For after all, you're to blame. I'd never have the courage. You will. Georges, a soul is at stake. He's my spiritual child. You took him away from me. And from God. You must give him back. He's been yours for too long. One day you'll thank me for all this. And the child too. For he'll know you really loved him. Tomorrow, after the prize-giving, when you've got yours... we'll meet, the three of us... and you'll give back the letters. But I can't do that! You'll explain. He'll never forgive me. I must see him. Not now! He'd never understand. Lauzon is on your side. He looks like winning... but you come out of it well... Write him a letter as only you can do. He believes you. What matters, Georges? Is it blood or not? - Did you do it? - Yes. That's the difference. First prize: Georges de Sarre. I'll congratulate your parents. For Alexandre Motier - You saw the Father? - Yes, yes. The goodbyes weren't long. Yes, we can go. - Ready? - Yes. Sit down for a moment. I've something to tell you about Georges. You haven't seen him? You know I haven't. Why? Well, I have. And that's why I want to speak to you. I suppose you still feel the same way? But I've to tell you something. Georges didn't feel... ...the same way about you... - Georges? - Yes, Georges. He regretted this special friendship between the pair of you. Know that Georges has broken it off... Has courageously broken with an unhappy past. And so that you'd understand... he left this for you. They're the letters you sent him... He didn't leave them himself so as not to hurt you. Maybe he hadn't the courage. I have. I'll ask him. He's gone... In his parent's car. I saw them leave. Be reasonable, Alexandre. Georges has gone. And he didn't say goodbye. He doesn't want to see you. You must understand that. Georges does. Did he give you them? He's written your name. Be a man, Alexandre! Give me back his letters. Why should I? Let's not miss our train. I'm unhappier than you. I loved him more. I didn't love him enough. You would never have had his letters. He didn't want to take them. I can't believe the accident! Father, it wasn't one. I hope you're wrong! I prefer the truth. Things are better like that. Never did a death upset me so. It happens every day... It's a part of my work... But this one was hard to accept. At the last moment, I'm sure, he saw the light. He was forgiven. Don't you agree? I don't know what I think. I can't accept his death. Why refuse consolation? This is what a Father feels... A Father. Yes, a Father This is it... As though I'd become younger to know unhappiness. "The pure in heart". It wasn't his purity I loved. Take this. I took it at Christmas. He served Mass that night. His heart was untouched then. There was no one, nothing. Keep it. Think of me. I really loved him. You'll decide for yourself what to do. Keep these too... They're his letters. I have confidence in you. Thank you. It's mutual, Father. This is the last letter I wrote him. I didn't know it would be. I said I'd been obliged to return his letters but that I'd see him in the summer. I wanted to give him it. Read it please. Don't ever doubt me. I'll deliver this letter myself. The thought delights me. I'll see your street... Watch out for you. Trust me as I trust you... I may have had other friends... But you're my only friend now. We have joy enough, To fill volumes and volumes... Our friendship is in my hands, After being in yours. I'll keep it, As you have... And our Friendship's name is Love. You're not dead. You haven't crossed the Styx. You're not a God. You're the boy I am, Breathing like me. Your blood is mine. Tomorrow's my birthday. We'll celebrate it together. You'll always be there... It's for you I'll live. All my life. THE END
