(fast paced music) (metal whistling through air) (soft thudding) (metal whistling through air) (soft thudding) (blades whistling) (whistling and snapping) (fabric snapping) (yelling) (whistling and snapping) (yelling) (tense music) (yelling) (bomb exploding) (gun firing) (tire grinding in sand) Get out. Come on. (motorcycle engines racing) Mama! (yelling) Papa! (yelling) [Papa] Brian, stay away! You asked for this! I haven't done anything wrong. (engine revving) Brian! Brian! Papa! Come back here! Police, freeze! Come back here! Freeze! (sad music) Kid, are you all right? We'll get them. It's okay. Those men down there. They killed your father. (energetic music) (fabric fluttering) (man sputtering) (body thudding) (tires screeching) (metal scraping) (blade whistling) (man grunting) (intense music) (quiet hissing) (quick whistling) (men grunting) (glass shattering) Hey. (gun firing) (gun firing) (foreboding music) (suspense music) (dart whistling) (soft thudding) White Eagle, you've done a fine job. I'd like you all to follow the example that White Eagle set. [All Men] Yes sir. We've worked hard these last few years. My organization is small but our power is great. And getting greater. People are afraid of us. A toast now to success. (men murmuring agreement) You've all done a great job but, don't be happy too soon. We still have one more enemy to face. Who's that? Tisiano. Mafia, he's dangerous. He must be eliminated. Boss, everything's ready. That's good. (tense music) Lucifer, you've been throwing your weight around. Is that what this meeting's all about? To say that? No, I just wanted to see you in the flesh. You're playing a dangerous game. No, you are, but thanks for the advice. Now I'm telling you, get out of this game before things get too rough, old man. What game's that? Prostitution, gambling, drugs? You've been a busy boy. Las Vegas, Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, you're getting too greedy my friend. So what do you want? I really don't know myself. It's a funny thing this power. Once you get a taste of it, you want more. And I want it all, old man. Well now, aren't you ambitious? Pity you won't live to see it though. Listen boy, I'll carve your ambitions on your tombstone. By the way old man, Got something to add? Yeah, I'm really sorry that you won't be around to see my dreams become a reality. I'm heart broken. (many guns firing) (bodies thudding) (impacts snapping) (blade scraping) Hey, give it to me. So, like I said, I'm really sorry. You all understand the case? [Several Men] Yes sir. Any questions? [Several Men] No. Now our first problem is, is to find out who is this killer here. I think this killer's a top assassin. So many people were killed, no evidence of a squad of men. It was too smooth. This man operates like a killing machine. Maybe this guy has underworld connections. You're just guessing. Tyler, you're heard all those stories now, haven't you? If it's the mafia then it's the FBI's business, isn't it? Within a week so many people are killed. It's our responsibility to find out who's to blame. And to bring them to justice. So now I'm forming a special unit. Hey Chief, it's my case. You've come up with zilch. I've got some important information. What is it? Tell me now. It's too early to say just yet, but I should have something soon. Bullshit. Don't give me that crap Tyler. I need that information and right now. I've gotta protect my informants or they won't trust me. Tell me at once. Mm mm. That's an order. Chief, think of my reputation. Don't rush into an investigation. My sources will come good. Just give me one week, that's all I'm asking for. All right, I'll give you three days. Three days. (water falling) I've only got three days, I need more information. It's in the newspaper. (tires screeching) Look out son! Are you crazy? (machine gun firing) He's got no stomach for all this killing! [Brian] But it was an innocent child. [Man] Not your concern! Come here, Brian, you're a ninja. Do not let feelings overcome your sense of loyalty to me. I'm proud of what you've accomplished, but you surprise me. Hm? So, think, think what I'm saying to you. Just think about it for a while. (Brian grunts acceptance) Let's leave here, all right? It's too late. No it's not, we still have time. You've always liked the countryside. We could buy some land and some horses, a few chickens too. We could start a family too. Hm, Mable, that's my dream too. But, it's impossible. We can't leave here. Brian, there must be a way. Master. Master? You going? There are questions that I must answer. [Brian] What questions Master? Tell me. Master, why are you so troubled now? A master has many problems that he must try and solve. Master, let me help. No, only I can resolve this. Then I must go. If you need me, I'll be at the shrine. The one on the hillside. This is where I come to be by myself, to solve my problems. Master? Please let me speak. There are things unknown to you, that only I see. Master? Then I'll go now. (phone ringing) Hello? [Voice On Phone] White Eagle? Oh, just a sec. For you. Hello, yeah? White Eagle, there's a mission, return to HQ. Okay. (guns firing) (men grunting) (throwing stars whistling) (soft thudding) (gun firing) (intense music) (gun firing) [Man] No don't! (gun firing) (gun firing) (sharp metal scraping) (grunting) (sword squelches flesh) (grunting) (intense music) Ha! (sword squelches flesh) What is it with you? What's wrong? I've got things on my mind. God damn it Brian. I've told you, you're a ninja, are you not? Yeah. So what does that mean to you? Show no mercy, feel no pain. And always obey your master. And do you? Then help me to destroy those who threaten us. You're my best man, you understand? Then show me. Yes sir. (surprised music) Mr. Tyler. We finally meet. I don't like you too much. Know why? What do you want? You know, you're a pain in the ass. Well that's just tough, isn't it? Yes, for you. (impacts snapping and grunting) (knife thudding) (Tyler screaming) Show me you can do it. (grunting) Do it! White Eagle. I can't do it. No. Why? He saved my life. No! (chain saw revving) No, no, no! You can kill her then. [Tyler] No! No! (impact snaps) [Lucifer] Kill her! No! No! No! (chain saw revs) [Tyler] No, no, no! No! (chainsaw cutting) No! (woman screaming) (chainsaw ripping through flesh) No, no! No! (knife squelches flesh) (impacts snapping) (impacts thudding) (grunting) He saved me. You have disgraced me. You have disgraced me! Go! (sad music) Keep an eye on him. Yes. (grunting) Why are you packing? Where are you going? To find master. So you've changed your mind! That's great Brian. Take me too. Mm mm, no way, it's far too dangerous. I want you to stay here. You think that I'm safe being left behind here? You're angry with me. Huh! (Brian sighs heavily) Look if you're good, and stay out of trouble, then you can come with me. Really? Mm, go pack some things. Oh, there's no need. I can buy some new things on the way. Go out to the car now, I'll be there soon. Be quick, won't you? Mm. (engine starting) (car exploding) Mable! (impacts snapping) (fighters exclaiming) Come on! (flames roaring) Mable. (sad music) I told you to watch him. How could you let him get away? Okay men, listen to me. I'm ordering all of you men here to search for him again. This time, you kill him, you understand me? [All Men] Yes sir. (gulping) Another. Hey man! I been watching you, drinking all alone, when there are all these broads out there. What do you say that you and I go outside and find us some action? You know what the girls are like? These girls'll do anything for you. Good looking girls, big girls, fat girls, you name it, there's everyone out there boy, just waiting for us. Come on, come with me. Back in a minute, okay? Hi, I wanna toast my birthday. Let's celebrate, right now, hm? Cheers. Cheers. (glasses clink) Here. Cheers, come on! (glass thuds on table) Hey! Hey, now cool down boy, it's cool, it's cool, okay? All right. Huh? Gimme that. (coughs) tastes like camel shit. I'm sorry, I'm just not used to it. No, I'm sorry. Hey. Hm. Have I told you I can read palms? Hm, let's see. I see four honkies, honkying out on you baby. Mmm. No, no, no, no, no, no. Now we wouldn't wanna waste that would we? Come to think of it, why not? (glass shatters) (laughs) Come on. (gurgling and coughing) (impact thuds) Hey, I owe you a drink boy, it's okay. Cool down, cool down. Come on, come on. (impacts thudding) Sorry, I didn't mean to do that to ya. Oh dear. Just wait a minute. I'm a great dancer you know. Let me show you some of my skills here. You whiteys got no rhythm. (dance music) This is tango. (foot thudding) That's the ballet. (fist thudding) That's the jitterbug. Just in case you missed it, one more, two more, three more, no more! (fist thudding) (groaning) Hello my friend, have a drink. It's on me. (chair crashes) Whoa! (impacts thudding) We gotta stop meeting like this. (impacts thudding) Oh my god. Ha! (bottle breaking) (impacts thudding) (glass breaking) (impacts thudding) Hey, the cops are coming. (bottle breaking) (gasping) (panting) Hey, wait for me, don't run off and leave me! Come back here! (gasping) Hi. Hey, you left me behind. Hey, what am I supposed to do? I got no job, I got no money, no place. Hey, I might as well come with you. I travel alone, you understand? Hey hey hey, hang on. I get your drift buddy, but because of you, I'm not wanted by the police you see. You can't leave my ass out there. You gotta look after me, am I right? (grunts) Don't hit me. Hey, please come on. (yells and grunts) Hey, hey now, be cool brother. Well I hope you're not working for Lucifer. Lucifer? You jiving me boy? Get out of here. Hey, take me along with you. Where I'm going, I'm going alone. Yeah? We're friends. My name's Eddie. Hey hey, so what's your name then? I'm just going for a piss, okay? Sure. I'll stay here on guard. Hey come, are you done yet boy? Okay, okay, I'm nearly finished. [Eddie] Let's go! (leaves rustling) (silly music) (eerie music) (several men grunting softly) (swords whistling) (men grunting) (swords ringing) (impacts thudding) (ground exploding) (ropes whistling and snapping) (swords whistling) Oh yeah. (impacts thudding) (metal whistling through air) (ground exploding) (metal whistling through air) (tree exploding) (ground exploding) (grunting) (sword whistling, Eddie grunting) (Impacts thudding) (sword whistling) Hmm, those dudes were heavy. Who were they? They were killers. What do you mean killers? What I said, killers, with no emotion at all. Hm. They only seem human when they die like the rest of us, that's all. I don't understand. You don't have to, Eddie. The less you know the better. Anyway, tell me how you found me. Oh, well, that was fate. You know, after you disappeared, I thought I'd just walk along, sort myself out, you know what I mean. Huh, what'd you decide then, tell me. Well, I gotta make a living somehow. Don't we all? Ehn, where ya gonna go? I've got business to finish. Business, let me help you. Mm mm. I promise I won't interfere. No way. I'll be all right. I'm sure most bosses don't mind hiring someone who's got the cops after him. I mean it could be worse, couldn't it? Take me with you. All right. You mean I can come along? Hm, don't get too excited. Well that's great. (Brian yawning) Don't you go changing your mind though. You know, I think that by having some company it might stop me worrying a bit. (Eddie laughs) Ya know, people always tell me I'm great company. (waves crashing) [Police Man] Freeze! You're under arrest. Let me out of here. [Officer] Keep quiet. Hey, but I'm innocent. [Officer] Shut up. Oh god damn it, what are we gonna do now? (Eddie laughs) Oh god, what's gonna happen to us then? We're just gonna rot in this prison. Maybe they'll put us on death row. We might even get the electric chair. You know what I'm talking about man, barbecued. You know what they do, they stick wires into your brain, manacles over your hands and you sit in a big metal chair and they send a couple of million volts through ya and then you fry. All my life I've kept on the right side of the law 'cause I know that once they get a person like me in a place like this, they're gonna do me in aren't they? Black man always gets shafted. That's why, aw ya gotta help me. What are you gonna do? Look Eddie, we've got more problems than that. My enemies might find us here. (metal gate grating) Hey, your bail's been paid. He's bailed you out, you can go now. Move it. - What'd you call my mother? - I said nothing, boy! (impacts snapping) [Officer] That's enough, stop now. These two are dangerous men, I won't release them. Take them back. Move! Come on, down the stairs, move it! I've gotta see my lawyer, let me talk to him. I'm innocent and I shouldn't be in here boy, you should know that, right? Honky. Oh my god I don't deserve this. What have I done? Why the hell'd bring me back here? You want to spend all of your life in prison? Of course not. You think I'm crazy? Look, we'll be out of here soon, I promise you. Huh? This boy's a fool, crazy. My god. I pulled the night shift again. (glass breaking) Hey, who are you? Oh, I'm new here. What happened to Fred, he's supposed to be on duty. He reported sick. Ah, okay. (foreboding music) (metal gate grating) (knife thudding) (impact thudding) (gasping and grunting) Hey, leave him there. Let's get out of this place, come on. Okay. - Hey you, freeze! - Stay there! Where ya going, huh? Sorry sir. Hey! (Eddie laughing) You telling me the truth? You jiving me boy? I can't believe it. You don't have to believe it. Tell me, who are you? I'm an assassin, but I'm sick of death. That's why they wanna kill you. Mmhm. Why? Because I've got principles. Yeah, I kill the guilty, but never the innocent. Oh, so you're an assassin, with principles? Tyler once saved my life, and I watched as he died. You better go. Why? Look, you stupid or something? I'm up to my neck in all this. I understand, I'm your friend, I can help you boy. It's gonna be okay. Hey, you wanna hear something funny? What my mother once said to me? That two chopsticks are better than one (laughs). There's trouble. Easy job. Let me handle 'em. Hi guys. You wanna go any further, you gotta get past me. Only three of you. (impacts thudding) (grunting) (Brian exclaiming non-verbally) This is my business, not his. Then let's attend to it, shall we? (impacts thudding) (men grunting) (ground exploding) (impacts thudding) (men grunting) (ground exploding) (explosion popping) Hey friend, these guys look pretty serious. Too serious for me. (tense music) (grunting) (ground exploding) (yelling) (metal whistling through air) (ground exploding) (sword whistling) (grunting) (net crashing) (ropes lashing) (throwing stars whistling and thudding) (tense music) Damn! What do you mean you couldn't kill him? We tried our best. You're trained killers. We'll keep looking then. Yeah. I know where he'll be. And I'm sure of it. (soft music) Hey Eddie, you can't come with me. There's really no point. My hands are already stained with blood. Besides, I'm used to killing. I must live or I must die by my principles. That's the way I am, I can't change it. Since Tyler was murdered, I realized my skills are a gift and I must use them properly, like my master taught me. I wanna change, I, It's my only hope, to start again. A brand new life. Eddie, my life's meaningless. For all my sins, my girlfriend was murdered. And before I too end up the same way, I must right the wrongs I've committed. For Tyler and my girlfriend and my master who taught me the true spirit of the ninja. Brian, I understand you. I really do. - Take care. - Yeah. See ya. Catch you later buddy. Yeah, bye. Master! Master! (swords whistling) (men grunting) (impacts thudding) (grunting) (Brian cries out) (impacts thudding) Master! (grunting) (grunting) Are you all right? I was attacked. Can I rest inside for a while? - Sure. - Please help. Quickly, get me in, please. (both grunting) (moaning) (Lucifer chuckling) Brian, there's no place left to run. I didn't run, I was looking for my master. So you tried to kill six of my men. In self-defense. They were amateurs, not like that man who, without conscience, killed my girlfriend. You seem determined to oppose me. I am determined. To find my master. So? Where is he? Why don't you tell me? You oughta know better than that. It was worth a try. Nobody crosses me. But I don't want him killed in my apartment, please. Okay, take him to headquarters. (gun firing) Lee, take him. (guns firing) (impacts thudding) Well done. Well now, looks like White Eagle won't die alone. Get him. What? Nothing but ropes down there. Search him, make it fast! Hey, hey man. You're a cop. That's right, so how about a little respect? That's what you think. Dead cops make good heroes. You'd be foolish if you tried. Your boss is pretty smart. If I'm alive, White Eagle, If you're alive he'd what? It's pretty simple. Use me as bait. To lure him out. Why should he risk his neck for you? Maybe he won't. Maybe I'm just buying time to bust your ass. (shower water running) (woman gasps and grunts) You shut up or I'll break your neck. Brian, I've been waiting for you. Don't look at me like that. I belong to Lucifer. I've got nothing to do with the fight between the two of you. Please believe me. I want to, but I don't understand what you're doing here. Because I knew you'd come. I could have left with him. Whatever your reasons, I've gotta use you to get Eddie back. I understand, but there's someone first you must see. There. Master! Master, I, You've come, my friend. She's a very good girl. Let's go upstairs. Master, if I'd known you were here, I could have freed you. Much too risky. How did you know I was here. I went to the shrine to look for you, but was attacked by ninjas. And after that, I'll tell you, I was wounded and found my way here. Now my friend Eddie's been captured by Lucifer. Now we must try and free your friend. - You. - Master. You and you. Yes. (impacts thudding) (men grunting) (phone ringing) (speaking in foreign language) Hello? [Brian On Phone] Is that you Lucifer? Of course it is, who's this? [Brian On Phone] You know who I am. So now what do you want, White Eagle? [Brian On Phone] I'll meet you tomorrow at the lumber yard. I want Eddie. Eddie? Don't you know he's a cop? Did you still want him? Yeah. [Lucifer On Phone] And what do I get then. Sara. You're in no position to bargain. [Brian On Phone] Make sure you treat Eddie well. I know how precious Sara is to you. Now you wouldn't want anything serious to happen to her, would you? Tomorrow. I have been a fool you know. I brought you up and taught you the art of ninjitsu, and the ninja skills, just like I taught Lucifer when he was a young boy. I taught you patience and calmness of heart. Now Lucifer has again rebelled against all of the teachings and everything that I have taught him. He is a dangerous man. And I question whether I have been a very good master. Or even a good man. You must be very careful. He cannot be trusted at all. I know that, that's why I left him. That's why he knew were to find you as your energies both come from the same source. You are both ninjas though you follow different paths. I know now that my path is different. You know, White Eagle, that we are the true ninjas. Lucifer has betrayed ninjitsu to follow the darkest side in a futile life of crime. A true ninja must uphold justice and law and order, which is the basis of society, White Eagle. Even if he must die in doing it. Yes Master. Sara has also been lead astray. You must forgive her. Mm. Mm, mm. Sara. (Sara gasps) How will it go tomorrow? Don't you worry, we'll be ready for him. Brian, I've been thinking. Isn't there some other way to save Eddie? You're the bait. The master and I will protect you, Sara. But I'm afraid of Lucifer. He took me in when I was desperate. He fed me, he clothed me and he loved me. But I'm not blind to his cruel side. His lust for power. He trusts me. He left me in charge of Master. Lucifer is used to getting his own way. He's dangerous. I guess I'm just a coward. Sara, you're a brave girl. Even Master, he thinks that you're just being used by Lucifer, and that's why my master took you into his confidence. Don't worry. We're gonna win. (tense music) I tried to help. (impacts thudding) (impending danger music) You dishonor me and the ninja code. You set me up. Today, I've made a judgement. You must die. (grunting) (impacts thudding) (weapon whistling through air) (Master groaning) (speaking in foreign language) (grunting) (impacts thudding) (Master groans) (impacts thudding) Quickly, come on! (heavy logs crashing to the ground) After them! (Master groaning) (Sara gasping) Look after Master. I'm going outside. All right. Hey Eddie. Hey, your master okay? Get out of here. Hey, but I can help you. What, you protect me? You're a cop. I got a lot to do. You go, we'll meet later. All right, don't you disappear. 'Cause I'll come looking for you. And I'll find you, you know that. Is that so? Yeah. 'Cause of this. Okay? So Tyler's your brother? Yeah. [Sara] Brian! Brian! Master. Master, are you all right? White Eagle, we must kill Lucifer. I was responsible for teaching you both. Now only you can kill him. Master! You must carry out my final wish. Master! Master, I will do it. (water tumbling over rocks) Ah, it's beautiful. (eminent danger music) (foot thumping) (metal whistling through air) (ground exploding) (weapons whistling) (groaning) (ground exploding) (coaster rattling along track) (electricity buzzing and erratic groaning) (impacts thudding) (carousel machinery clanging) (groaning) (impacts thudding) (blades gliding on ice) (spikes grinding on ice) (impacts thudding) (grunting) (swords whistling through air) (impacts thudding) (throwing stars whistling through air) Come on. It's time to face Lucifer now. I'll go with you. I can't take any chances. I must go there by myself. Okay, I understand. I'll wait for you in the other pavilion. Bye. Brian. Mm? You must come back for me. Sure, I will, don't worry. Bye. (adventurous music) (arrow flying and thudding) (dart whistles and thuds) Got a light? Sure. Remember, stay alert, all right? Frank, cover me. (string breaking) (thudding) Peter? Peter? Fuck. Hey. Hey. (arrow whistling and splashing) (arrow thudding) (gunshots firing) Way to go! (gunshots firing) (shed exploding, men groaning) (rapid guns firing) (men screaming) Hey, it's just like a turkey shoot. (gun cocking and firing) (gun firing) (glass breaking) (model plane propellers clicking) (shed exploding) (men screaming) (rapid guns firing) (throwing stars whistling through air) (Thudding) (screaming) (rapid guns firing) (grenades exploding (men screaming) (rapid guns firing) (grenade exploding) (metal whistling through air) (thudding) (screaming) (glass shattering) (guns firing rapidly) (glass shattering) (yelling) (rapid guns firing) (men screaming) (yelling) (metal whistling through air) (grunting) (guns firing rapidly) (glass shattering) Come on! (impact thudding) (gun firing rapidly) (wires whistling) (men groaning) (guns firing rapidly) (glass shattering) (guns firing rapidly) (men screaming) [Sara] Be careful Brian. Get back. (Sara crying) Is that the man you want, huh? Is that the man you want to die for? Not only are a traitor, but you turned my woman against me. You're a low-life. All right, this is the way I deal with traitors. I've been waiting for this. (Sara whimpering) [Sara] Oh no, no. (metal clanking) (gun firing rapidly) [Men] Don't move! (yelling) (impacts thudding) (grunting) (men exclaiming non-verbally) (Lucifer groaning) (impacts thudding) (grunting) (Sara screaming) You bastard! (Sara crying) Brian! (rapid thudding) (Brian yells) (impact thudding) (rapid thudding) (grenades exploding) (yelling) (swords whistling and clanging) (yelling) (water splashing) (suspense music) (whistling through the air) (grenades exploding) (arrow whistling) (wood snapping) (whistling through air) (yelling) (metal ringing) (grenade exploding) (swords whistling) (grenade exploding) (cyclone blade whistling through air) (swords whistling and clanging) (throwing stars whistling) (metal ringing) (cyclone blade whistling through air) (grenade exploding) Well? (Sara crying) Brian, oh Brian. I'll wait for you. I'll wait, I'll wait for you. No Sara, it's too long to ask you to wait. Oh, I don't care. As a police officer, I'd read you your rights and slap the cuffs on you both. But right now I'm off duty. Get out of here. Get going! Hm! Quick before I change my mind! I go back on duty in a minute. Then I have to arrest you both! (happy music)
