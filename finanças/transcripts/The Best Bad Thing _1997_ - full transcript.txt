(gentle music) (uplifting music) - Darling, it's so exciting, it's so... - It's so new. A star is born. Come on. - [Rinko] During the summer of 1935, when I was 12 years old, I spent every afternoon I could in the Rialto theater with my friend Frances Parker. We wanted to to be famous movie stars when we grew up. Of course, I was going to need a new name. Frances thought I should go for something glamorous, like Eve or Ophelia, or Evangeline. Anything but my real name, which no one can pronounce. Rinko Tsujimura. - Oh look, next Saturday, Flash Gordon. I can't wait. - Yeah. Hey, let's ride the rail. - Here he comes. - Okay, the coast is clear. - Me first. Woo! Your turn. Rinko, hurry! - Okay. - Hey you. - Uh-oh. I think we better scram. - Let's go. - Japs. - See you Saturday! - [Frances] Bye Rinko! (lively music) - Every night, I write in my five year diary all the things that happened that day. But whoever made the diary must have led a very dull life. There are only five lines for each day. And even my dullest days can take up more than five lines. The day before the 49th day anniversary of Mr. Hata's death took up a whole page, which means in my diary, it started on June 29th, 1935, and ended up in 1939. That's because it was the day Mama and Papa announced that as far as I was concerned, summer was over. You're gonna send me to stay with Mrs. Hata? And those two horrible brats? Mama, how could you? - Mrs. Hata is my oldest friend, Rinko. She's going through a rough time. - Papa? - Mrs. Hata needs help. Not just in the fields, with the house work too. - But what about my summer? I've got plans. Frances and I have hundreds of things to do before school. - Oh, you still have a lot of summer left. Now hold still. I'm almost done. - But who will empty the pan under the ice box? Do the shopping, help with the laundry? - Oh, we wouldn't want you to get your hands dirty, would we? Evangeline. - All right for you, Joji Tsujimura. - [Joji] That hurt. - [Rinko] Serves you right! - Hey, you two, stop that. Or you'll be sorry. - Cut it out, all of you. Look what you've done to the laundry. Rinko, you're going, and that's that. - The Hatas live miles from anywhere. Zenny and Abu hate me. Hey, why not send Joji? They like him, he likes them. - What Mrs. Hata needs now is someone like a daughter. - Someone she can talk to. She's lonely, Rinko. She needs company as much as help. - But for the whole summer? I could go as crazy as she is. - No, no, she's not crazy. She's just a little different. - She hardly speaks English. - You'll do fine. - Okay, but just for July, then you have to come and take me home, so at least I can have some fun before school starts. - Just for July it is. Mrs. Hata will be very happy. - When are we going to go? - Tomorrow. It's the 49th day memorial of Mr. Hata's death. - Ooh, the 49th day. It's so creepy. - Rinko, show some respect. - Don't worry, Rinko. Like Mama always says, sometimes things that seem bad turn out to be good. - [Frances] It was all arranged behind your back? - Yes. Can you believe it? They ruined my whole summer. - [Frances] Popcorn? - No more popcorn, no more movies, no more fun or anything. - Yeah, it'll be strange going to movies without you. - You're gonna go alone? - Well, not alone. I'll go with Betty. - [Usher] Quiet. - I can't not go just because you can't go, and I don't wanna go all by myself. - I've got an idea. You can write me and tell me the stories. - Maybe. Do you think the mailman actually goes all the way out there? - Of course. It's not like I'm going to Timbuktu. - Sounds like it to me. - [Father] Don't worry, Rinko. You'll like Mrs. Hata. The lady's got a lot of gumption. - [Rinko] Gumption? She wears a hot water bottle on her back. - [Mother] Because her back hurts from working in the fields all day. - She's the only Japanese woman I know who can drive a truck. ♫ Oh beautiful ♫ Oh spacious skies ♫ For amber waves of grain ♫ For purple mountain majesties ♫ Above thy fruited plain ♫ America, America ♫ God shed His grace on thee ♫ And crown thy good with brotherhood ♫ From sea to shining sea (background noise drowns out dialogue) (speaking in Japanese) - Hello Rinko. Nice to see you. Here. You have this one. Like cucumber? Good. We have plenty cucumber. (laughs) (bell dinging) (chanting in foreign language) - [Rinko] Papa led the service to mark the 49th day anniversary of Mr. Hata's death, which is the day when Buddhists believe the soul finishes its journey to Heaven. It was a lot different than being at our Christian church, and I was surprised that he and Mama even knew what to do. (speaking in foreign language) I couldn't tell how Mrs. Hata's sons, Zenny Chito and Abraham Lincoln felt about their father getting into Heaven. All I knew was that they didn't seem particularly happy to have me spending the next month at their house. (gentle music) - [Boy] Strike two, one more then you're out. - [Boy] Better look out, Joji. This here is my special curve. - Hey, get back to work. - Just who made you the boss? - Nobody, but you're... You're wasting perfectly good cucumbers. - These ones are crooks, they're not good for anything. Batter up. - Goodbye Rinko. Don't worry, we'll see you soon. - [Rinko] Bye bye, Mama. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - [Boy] Bye, so long. (speaking in foreign language) - We'll see you at the end of the month. Okay, Zenny, let 'er rip. (engine starting) - [All] Bye! (speaking in foreign language) - What's wrong with her? Why can't she carry her own suitcase? - Yeah. - Because I say you take up. - Hey, watch it. My gramophone records are in there. - Gramophone records? - Yeah, in that one. So don't bang it or anything. - Oh, I won't. Gramophone records. Hear that, Abu? - Yeah, I can already hear them. (humming) - Hey! - Where are we gonna plug in the gramophone payer, Abu? - [Abu] Same place as the lamp? - Ha-ha, very funny. - Come on, Abu, let's get out of here. - This is our sister's room, so don't make a mess. - Sister? What sister? - He just means if we had a sister. Come on. (dramatic music) - Now I understood why Zenny and Abu laughed at my records, and I felt like an idiot. I didn't think I could stand it for a whole month. Here I was, dumped in the middle of nowhere, with nothing but nothing as far as the eye could see. There was no electricity, no radio, no telephone, no bathroom. There weren't even any clocks. But Mrs. Hata said, "Who need clock, we have train." And that first morning, I was so hungry I was already awake when the Union Pacific from San Francisco came by at 6:00 a.m. I couldn't wait to dig into a big country style breakfast of bacon and eggs and toast. (speaking in Japanese) Good morning. - Good morning. - 'Morning. - Please. - Soup? For breakfast? - And rice. We fatten you up. Crack egg. Very tasty. - Thank you. (speaking in Japanese) Do you always have soup for breakfast? - Everyday since I was little girl. - [Zenny] 6:45 to Bakersfield. - Yes. - Time for work. - [Rinko] On that first morning, we spent everyday working in the fields from dawn 'til dusk. (gentle music) I never knew farming was so tiring. And I'll never eat another slice of cucumber without thinking about how much work goes into it. - Hey, watch it. - [Rinko] Sorry. - [Abu] I told you not over here. - Sorry. Sorry. - Do you wanna help? - I'm just trying. - Then just keep out of the way. - Rinko, you are with me. Long trip. I get lonely. Okay. All right, let's go. Zenny, engine. Mister truck, please, please start. (engine starting) (laughing) Thank you, thank you! (gentle music) - Ma, you're going the wrong way. - I go forward. (uplifting music) - Mrs. Hata, why is there smoke coming out of the barn? Mrs. Hata, is there someone in the barn? - Nice earlobes. You have nice earlobes. - Thank you, Mrs. Hata. - Call me Auntie. Yes, like yours. A grain of rice. Mean good fortune. All life long. - Really? That's swell. You sure are a good driver. Did Mr. Hata teach you? - When Mr. Hata alive, he drive, I watch him. Now, Mr. Hata dead. I drive, he watches. - [Rinko] When Mr. Hata got tuberculosis, Mama and Papa worried that Zenny and Abu would catch it too, so they talked Mrs. Hata into taking him to a hospital in Los Angeles. When he came home, he was in a wooden coffin. Mrs. Hata was having a hard time working with farm and raising the boys alone. And I could tell she was remembering Mr. Hata and wishing he was still here. - Plenty egg. Get big and strong. (gentle music) - Zenny, how much? - 60 for ones, 50 for twos, 40 for threes. 12 dollars and 25 cents. - Oh you got that right. (speaking in foreign language) Let's go. Rinko, ride in back with boys. More fun for you. (gentle music) - See this? Carved it myself. Just gonna make it a bit bigger. - So? - Bet ya you don't know what it's for. Do ya? - Don't know and I don't care. - Here, I'll show ya. - Go ahead, you can just pee in that hole all day long for all I care. - Cut it out, Abu. They ain't no way to act around a girl. - Okay. Sorry. Shake? - Okay. (gasps) What's that? - [Abu] Hey, be careful. - [Rinko] What is it? - Just Herbert, Abu's pet. Don't worry, a little red eared turtle ain't gonna hurt you none. - All right for you, Abraham Lincoln Hata. - All right for you. (laughing) (speaking in Japanese) (chickens clucking) (dramatic music) - [Rinko] What are you looking for? - Sometimes at night, you can see spirits out there in the fields. - What kind of spirits? - The spirits of dead people. Come back from the spirit world. - They take you with them and you die. - Oh yeah, sure. - Maybe even our father. - What do they look like? - Sort of like flickering lights. - And how do you know they're spirits? Maybe they're just fireflies. - No they're not. You'll see. (speaking in foreign language) - Thank you. - You like a bath, Rinko? - Bath? A bath? Yes, I'd love a bath, but where? - Where? I show you. (speaking in Japanese) We all have bath tonight. - [Zenny] Ah Ma! - [Abu] Ah Ma! - [Mrs. Hata] Hey. (speaking in Japanese) - What stops me from being boiled to death? (laughing) - Don't worry. No boil. Wash, rinse. In tub. Settle good. Nice soak under stars. - I wash myself first, then I take a bath? - Yes. Wash first with the bucket. Spoon, water, and tub clean for others. Just like in Japan. - Auntie Hata? (speaking in Japanese) Have you ever seen spirits in the fields? - No see. But, not many spirit, not there. Wash, wash, wash, wash. (speaking in Japanese) - How come she gets to go first? - I always go first. - Rinko is guest. Run. (speaking in Japanese) (dramatic music) - There must have been a million stars in the sky, sparkling like diamonds. They made me feel very small and very alone. I missed my Mama and Papa. I even missed Joji. The Hata's were just so different. And I didn't think I'd ever fit in. (dramatic music) (groaning) Auntie Hata, Auntie Hata! - Rinko, what's wrong? - There's somebody out there. A man. He went into the barn. - Huh? - He could be a burglar, an ax murderer. - No bother. No ax murderer. - Yamanaka son. - Yamanaka son? - Mr. Yamanaka. - Mr. Yamanaka? Who's Mr. Yamanaka? - The old man you saw. - He works at the metal works. - Works the night shift. - Yamanaka's a Buddha, live in barn. We leave him alone, he leave us alone. (speaking in Japanese) - How come no one told me about this Mr. Yamanaka? - It wasn't none of your business. Come on, Abu. - Hey, where are you going? - To get coal. - Coal? Where? - There's a spill about half a mile up the tracks. Plenty of coal, free for the taking. - Mind if I come along? - Okay with me I suppose. (speaking in Japanese) - Did you hear me? - Yeah, Ma, we heard. - We heard, Ma. - Rinko, you make sure my boys keep off train, keep far away, no trained. - I'll make sure Auntie Hata. What did your Mama mean, keep off train? - She meant no hopping freights. - Hopping freight trains? Like hobos? You do that? - Yeah, sometimes. - Well, isn't it hard? - Not for a boy. Maybe for a girl. Strike! - Well, I don't see what's so hard about it. - You'd never do it. - Being you're a girl and all. - Girls can't hop freights? Who says? - Not saying they can't, just saying that they don't. Normally. (gentle music) Here it is. - [Rinko] Wow, look at it all. - [Man] Hey, that coal ain't for you. Little Japs. This here coal is mine. You go back down the tracks and get your own. - We got here first. - Leave him alone. - You stay out of this, girly. - You big bully. - Stop it. - Hey kid, beat it. - Hey! (grunting) (ominous music) - You. Leave kids alone. - Oh yeah? Says who? (suspenseful music) - Go! - Okay, I'm goin'. But don't you think I ain't seen you sneaking up and down these tracks, hiding from people. Smells pretty fishy to me. - You boys all right? - Yeah. You sure showed him, Mr. Yamanaka. - You're Mr. Yamanaka? - Mr. Yamanaka. - My name is Rinko Tsujimura. I'm very pleased to meet you. - Don't tell your Mama. She have enough worry already. - Yes sir. (humming) Listen. - What? - Yep, one's coming. - A train? - [Zenny] Let's get on from this side. - [Rinko] You can't, you promised. - We didn't promise. We just didn't say nothin' one way or another. You ain't gonna be a snitch are you? - I won't tell, if you show me how to do it. - [Abu] Nah, you'll be too scared. - Oh yeah? Wanna bet? - [Abu] Sure, I bet you a million billion dollars. - Show me how to do it. Quick. - You just gotta run along side of the car, fast as the train, grab hold of one of the bars, and pull yourself up. - That's it? - Gettin' on is easy, getting off's the hard part. - It is? - You just gotta jump the same way the trains goin', else wise the wheels could go right over. - And... You're a goner. - Okay, first me, then Abu and Rinko. (lively music) - Hey Zenny, hey Abu, look at me! - Speeding up, get off. Come on. - Getting off. - Hurry up. - I can't. How do I do it? - [Abu] Quick! Before it's too late. - [Zenny] Jump! - It's going too fast. - [Zenny] Jump! (suspenseful music) - [Rinko] Ow. - Boy, you almost got yourself killed. - I told you to jump the same way the train was going. - I think I sprained my ankle. - [Abu] Oh no. - [Rinko] What am I gonna tell your Mama? - Don't tell her nothin'. I mean, Abu won't snitch. We'll get the old man to fix it. - Sorry. - It's okay, at least you did it. Should have seen Abu the first time he tried. - Zenny. I ain't paying you no million billion dollars. - Oh yeah? (knocking) - Mr. Yamanaka, we did help. (door creaking) It's Rinko, she twisted her ankle. - [Yamanaka] Shut door. (dramatic music) - Abu, no. - Zenny. - Keep still. Lucky. Not too bad a sprain. Soon feel better. - You mean I don't have to go to the hospital? - No. Just to sit. The wife. Next time be more careful. Jumping on freight train. (dramatic music) - It looks like a a ghost. - You believe in spirits? - I'm not sure. Sometimes I think I do. But Zenny and Abu do for sure. They say there are spirits in the fields. Even the spirit of their father. - Enough. You go home. (dramatic music) Rinko. Do not tell anybody about Mr. Yamanaka. Not to Mama, Papa, not to friends. (speaking foreign language) - Why not? - I have reason! Now go. (dramatic music) - I'm sorry Auntie Hata. I won't do it again, I promise. - Rinko. I know you good girl. Rest now huh. - Auntie Hata. What's wrong with Mr. Yamanaka? Why is he so unfriendly? - Yamanaka. Hard times. It's not easy, strange land, hard work, no money, afraid, lonely, very lonely, lot of time. But Rinko, you like daughter to me. Daughter number two. - Daughter number two? You already have a daughter? - I show you her. (singing in foreign language) This daughter. (singing in foreign language) My village, Japan. Neighbor. With my mother. - She's so pretty. But why isn't she here? (speaking in Japanese) Auntie Hata told me she was so poor when her daughter was born, that she had to send her back to Japan to be raised by her mother, and that she dreamed of having enough money to send for her someday. (speaking in Japanese) Made me feel even worse about causing her more trouble by twisting my ankle. Auntie Hata, you don't have to be lonely while I'm here. - That's right, Rinko. Don't have to be lonely. (speaking in Japanese) - [Rinko] But I was still worried. Mama always says, bad things happen in threes. My twisted ankle was one bad thing, so I had to expect two more. And when I saw that black car coming up the road, I was frightened. Anybody in a car that big and shiny had to be trouble. (dramatic music) (ominous music) - What you tryin' to do, scare me? My name's Saunders, I'm from the bank. What's this thing? What this here? - That there. It's a bath. See, you build a fire, then you heat the water over the fire, then you wash yourself. Then you sit on that wooden thing so you don't get scalded. And that's it, you take a bath outdoors. Under the stars. - Wash tub. - Sometimes you can even see spirits out in the fields. Over there. - Your kids' father home? - Mother is. But she's not mine. Mrs. Hata. - [Hata] Hi. - The names Saunder's from First Monument bank. - First Momument... Where Mr. Wilson? - Wilson. You understand, Mrs. Hata, that you're three months behind on your mortgage? Your farm payment. - Mr. Wilson, he say harvest cucumber for us to pay later. - Yeah, well. Wilson's moved on, and I've taken over his accounts. And I say, be on time. Now, you got anyone to help you run this place? - Abu help, Zenny help, Rinko help. - No other sources of income? - [Hata] Hmm? - A job? Cooking, cleaning. You people like to squeeze yourselves in, don't ya? How about boarders? - Boarder? No. - What about Mr. Yamanaka? - No, Mr. Hata not boarder. Mr. Hata dead, just us now. Just us. - Dead? But the mortgage is in the name of Zen-rye-eye-cho Hata. Born in the United states. - Zennyicho Hata. American boy. - Whatever you say. You got 'til the end of the month, Mrs. Hata. Haven't paid up by then, we'll have to take steps. - I not understand. - We'll seize your assets, such as they are, in lieu of payment. And if that doesn't cover it, we're foreclose and you'll have to move off. Leave. Sayonara. - Sayonara, no no. No leave. Mr. Hata and I choose this land to raise family. - Look, Mrs. Hata. Wilson lost his job because of accounts like this. I'm not about to. So you better start praying for that harvest of yours, huh? - Praying? Yes praying. With Mr. Hata. (engine starting) (engine revving) (horn beeping) (dramatic music) - [Rinko] I didn't like the man from the bank, and I didn't like the way he threatened to take away Auntie Hata's farm. But why did she lie about Mr. Yamanaka? (thunder rumbling) And why did he live in that leaky old barn? (dramatic music) - More trouble? - No. That's beautiful. Why do you make so many kites? Where do you get these brushes? How'd you learn to do that? - Why you ask so many questions? - Well, I... - No. Don't answer. It goes, kite. Special kite. Up in sky. You go up too. Not just in mind though, but hand too. Finger feel kite, feel, pull. Fell need. Become part of sky. - But, why don't you... - Enough talk. - But why don't you fly them? Not once since I've been here. - No wind. - Hey Zenny. - We better not. - Come on, come on, come on. Please. - Okay. - [Abu] Hey, where are you going? - [Zenny] We've gotta get some more cukes. - No, you don't. We have plenty. (train horn tooting) - Don't put 'im there, he'll die. - [Abu] Okay. - Put him in the shade. - [Abu] Let's go. - You better not! (speaking in Japanese) (speaking in Japanese) (speaking in Japanese) - What you like today? Smell this. - [Rinko] Strawberry? - That's right. Hair pomade made by my missus. Come in three different scents. Want to try some? - Uh... - Hey Kosuke. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - Okay, anything else? (speaking in foreign language) It's okay, pay next time. (speaking in foreign language) Here's your paper. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - I don't understand. - They just arrested a whole bunch of Japanese illegals in San Francisco. - But you're not illegal. - No, but make me wonder. Maybe they no let Kio come back United States. But Rinko, you and boys no worry. Where are boys go anyway? - I'll get them Auntie Hata. - Thank you. (speaking in Japanese) - Zenny, Abu! Get off now! Right now! Otherwise I really will tell your mother! (screaming) Abu! Zenny! Zenny, Zenny! Abu! - Abu's dead! Abu's dead. He fell underneath the wheels. He's dead. - Shut up, stop screaming. - He was just fooling around, he lost his balance. He's dead. - He's breathing, he's still alive. Come on, help me carry him. We have to get him back home. - Ma, Ma! - Auntie Hata, Auntie Hata! (speaking in Japanese) - What happened? (speaking in Japanese) - I'm sorry, Ma. I'm sorry, he jumped... (speaking in Japanese) - You're gonna be okay, Abu, you're gonna be okay. (speaking in Japanese) (dramatic music) He's gonna be okay, Auntie Hata. Everything's gonna be okay. He's gonna wake up soon, Auntie Hata. I know he is. - I should have said no. - Visiting hours are over. You'll have to leave now. - What? - We have to leave. - No. I no leave. - He's asleep, Ma. - Abu know I'm here. So I stay. You go make works, okay. Tell Yamanaka what happened. Go home with. (speaking in Japanese) I stay. (dramatic music) - Hey, what are you kids doing? This time of night? - We're waiting for Mr. Yamanaka, sir. We need him to take us home. - On account of my brother. He's in the hospital. - Wait here. I'll go get him. - Zenny, Rinko. What are you doing here? - Abu jumped wrong, got cut by a train wheel. Right in the air. We took him the the hospital, but Ma said to come here. You'd take us home. - Abu? But how is him? - The doctor said he's unconscious. - And he lost a lot of blood. - Okay, how about you take the rest of the night off, and take these children home to bed? - Thank you. I go change. - Abu monkey? What did he call him monkey? (dramatic music) See any spirits? - I don't think so, do you? - No! You can't have him. You can't take Abu! You can't take him! (dramatic music) Auntie Hata didn't come home for hours, and I was afraid another bad thing had happened. When at last I heard her voice, I saw that I wasn't the only one who was worried. Mr. Yamanaka had waited up too. (speaking in Japanese) - No truck. (speaking in Japanese) (speaking in Japanese) - [Rinko] I'd never seen Auntie Hata look so warn out. When she told Mr. Yamanaka that someone had stolen her truck from outside the hospital, I could tell it was the last straw. And that was that, I thought. The third bad thing. First my ankle, then Abu's accident, and now the truck. Things seemed to be going from bad to worse, ever since I arrived. Then I wondered if I had put a jinx on Auntie Hata's life. - No truck. Me finish. - [Rinko] Each morning, she walked all the way to the hospital to stay with Abu. She didn't care about the housework. She didn't care about the cucumbers. All she cared about was Abu getting well. - I wish it would rain. - I wish there was some wind. - What good's wind? - I don't know, but... - We got cuke's ripening so fast we can hardly keep up. And we don't have a truck to take 'em to the plant. So what the hell good is wind? What's the point in picking them at all? - [Rinko] Do you have a better idea? - Nah, guess not. (dramatic music) - [Rinko] Abu, Abu! - [Zenny] Abu! - Hey. Zenny, Rinko, come here. (speaking in Japanese) - Come on, let's go. Oh no. - They stink. - Cucumber rotten. So hot today. (speaking in Japanese) - [Hata] Cannot be helped. - But they're ripe. - Only want Abu get well. - But we have to pick them. - Such a waste. Such a waste. - [Rinko] I still wanted to believe that bad things came in threes. But the minute I saw Mr. Saunders was back, I realized I was wrong. And it also looked like Mr. Yamanaka also figured there would be nothing but trouble from the man in the black car. - Hello. Mrs. Hata. (sighs) Is your mother home? - She's not my mother. - Mr. Saunders. From back, yes? - That's right, Mrs. Hata. Mr. Saunders from bank. I warned you, Mrs. Hata. Haven't you wondered where the truck went? - My truck? - I told you assets would be repossessed, and you have payment on your mortgage. But, as you can see from the appraisal on the truck, it doesn't begin to meet your debt. - You took truck? - That's what I said. Look, Mrs. Hata, I don't have a choice in the matter. If you can't pay your mortgage, you'll lose the farm. It's as simple as that. - But this home, this my children's home. - You got one more week, Mrs. Hata. Then I gotta move you out, put a lock on that door. One week. (somber music) (engine starting) - A repossession notice from bank. This... Very bad. - So why didn't you help? You just hid when he came. - Hide? I not a hider. - Mr. Yamanaka, please. You've gotta do something. - Nothing I can do. - There must be something. What are you afraid of? - Only things I no can control. - So then why don't you help? - Rinko. You know what is a zero quota law? - No. - Law make it impossible any new Japanese be immigrant to United States. - You're already here. - Long ago, when my papa die, I was number three son, so nothing for me in Japan. Got a cook job on freight. I have a dream, make a fortune in gold, then go back Japan, rich enough. So, jump a ship in San Francisco. But things not work out that way. Here I am, still hard labor work. And not on ship this time, but in metal work. - Just because you're not rich, doesn't mean you can't help Auntie Hata. - I never got the immigration paper, Rinko. Because zero quota law, I no can get now. - You're an illegal alien? - If they find me, I go to jail. So you know now, that I no can have people snoop around here, find out where I live. - But, but we have to do something. All Auntie Hata has is the farm and her family, and she's gonna lose both of them if something good doesn't happen soon. (praying in Japanese) (speaking in Japanese) When I first heard the voice, I thought it was a spirit, but it wasn't a spirit. It was Auntie Hata talking to Mr. Hata as if he were alive, and asking him for help. She told him she was finished, she didn't have the strength to go on. (speaking in Japanese) No, you can't give up! (gasping) - Rinko, you scare me. (laughs) - I'm sorry. The words just popped out of my mouth, as though maybe Mr. Hata put them there. - Mr. Hata spirit did feel close. Maybe Mr. Hata make you speak. But Mr. Hata not understand. No truck, so house and cucumber, how make money. How take care of Abu and Zenny? (dramatic music) How we get money now, Rinko? (dramatic music) - I don't know. (dramatic music) We gotta do something, or the bank man's gonna take your farm away. Hey, where you going? - Mr. Yamanaka, he'll know what to do. - No, he won't. He won't do anything. (speaking in Japanese) - Mr. Yamanaka. - He's not even here. - But he's always here at this time. It's too early for work. - See, he's given up. He's scared. - Mr. Yamanaka isn't scared of anything. - I'm just saying, we can't ask him for help. It's up to us. - What can we do? - I don't know. We need money, and all we have is cucumbers. - Here she comes. Ma, how's Abu? - Hello, Auntie Hata. Here, we made supper for you. - Thank you both. So much. - How's Abu? - Abu say, he want to see you too, Rinko. - He's awake? - He can talk? - He wants to see us? Abu, it's me. You okay? - Next time I'll jump better. - Don't have to pay the million billion dollars you owe me. - [Zenny] Look who I brought? - Herbert. Thank you, Zen. - The doctor's said Abu was going to be just fine. I was sure everything was gonna work out now, because Zenny and I had come up with this great idea for making money to help out. Fresh cucumbers! - Fresh cukes. - Fresh cucumbers, sweet and delicious. Best cucumbers ever. (brakes squealing) - They're stopping. Our first sale. - We're gonna make a fortune. Farm fresh cukes, three for five cents. Hand picked, right from the field. - Oh. No, Harv, they're Japs. Let's go. - [Rinko] Hold up the sign. - Why bother? We've been here all day, we ain't made but one lousy dime. - [Rinko] They're not gonna stop unless you hold it up. - [Zenny] See, it's all just a waste of time. - Hey, what are you doing? - [Zenny] Strike. - All right for you, Zenny Chito Hata. You're wasting perfectly good cucumbers. - What's the difference? - Stop it! - Why? Ain't worth nothin'. See? They ain't worth nothin'. - Rinko. - I'm sorry, Auntie Hata. We tried, we really tried. This is all me made. 10 cents. - Where Zenny? - He went home. - Rinko, you did best you could. - I don't want you to lose Zenny and Abu. - Oh Rinko, don't worry, Rinko. All will be okay. Come. We go home now. - [Rinko] What about the cucumbers? - Well, we have plenty cucumber. Plenty. (gentle music) - Spirit light. - [Aunt Hata] Huh? - [Rinko] Spirits, Auntie Hata. Zenny said I'd see them. - What? Who that? Mr. Saunders? From bank? - [Rinko] Auntie Hata. (truck downs out dialogue) - What he bring up here? - Auntie Hata, look. - [Aunt Hata] Who are you? You from bank? - Huh? No, from the metal works. - Metal works? - We got the night off to pick all these cucumbers. (speaking in Japanese) (uplifting music) - Mr. Yamanaka. - Yeah, Rinko. - You did it, Mr. Yamanaka. - Rinko, you just standing there, huh? Will you help? - You did it. You helped after all. - Yamanaka, you scare us. Trucks, strangers. How did it happen? - Mr. Sabatini very kind. Get them in from metal works. Help. (speaking in Japanese) - No, no no no no. Your friend Monkey organized the whole thing. Like I tell the fellas, when times are tough, we all gotta stick together. - His name is not monkey. His name is Monkichi. (laughing) - Monkey, Monkichi, Ma-cookie, what the difference? You think he can pronounce my name? Sabatini. (laughing) - I go make food for you all. (ominous music) - Mr. Yamanaka, that man from the tracks, he saw you. - Our kind live a whole life afraid somebody find out. Have work to do. Rinko, you have work to do too. (speaking in Italian) - What did you say? - I'll tell you when we're finished. Let's go breakfast. Huh? (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - [Sabatini] Hey, Angelo, come on (mumbles) celebrate. Give me the cup. Try. (speaking in Italian) - Very thirsty. (laughs) Strong. - Strong, strong. (gentle music) (speaking in Japanese) - [Sabatini] You see? What I been telling you guys? Come on. (speaking in Italian) (gentle music) (speaking in Japanese) - [Rinko] And there it was, just like that. The cucumbers were picked, Auntie Hata's money problems were solved, Abu was coming home, and summer was almost over. It was time for me to go home too. I hated this room when I first arrived. But now was sad to leave. - Where's your mother? - She's not my... She's at the hospital. Here. - Could have told me. Saved me the trip out here. - Could have called, told us you were coming. What about the truck? - This will get it back for you. - [Officer] County Sheriff's department. - Sheriff's department? (chuckles) What are you fellas doin' way out here? - We got reason to believe there's an illegal alien on these premises. (suspenseful music) Check the barn. - No, there's no one in the barn. It's just a bunch of junk. - Zenny, no! - Mr. Yamanaka! - He's gone. - Nobody lives here, huh? Stone cold. Looks like we're too late. You tell your folks it's a federal offense to harbor an illegal alien. - [Rinko] Yes sir. - And don't forget, first day of each month, payment in full. Or the whole bunch of you are out of here. - [Rinko] He left a letter. - [Zenny] Where? - [Rinko] My good friends, Mrs. Hata, Zenny, Abraham and Rinko. - [Yamanaka] The time has come for me to move home. I am leaving all my kites for you boys, but the butterfly is for Rinko. Fly them well, and think of me. Your friend, Manchi Yamanaka. - Why'd he go? Why'd he turn chicken and run? - He didn't turn chicken. It was time for him to leave. Just like the lone ranger. Do you hear that? - Yeah. - Wind. - [Yamanaka] Remember, not too much. If kite asks for line, just feed it a little at a time. - It's beautiful. (gentle music) Let out some more line, Zenny. - [Zenny] I'm letting it out, I'm letting it. There it goes. Awe, look at it. - [Yamanaka] Easy, that's it. You got it. (uplifting music) - [Rinko] At last I understood what Mr. Yamanaka meant about becoming one with the kite. I really felt as though I was the butterfly up there, and that I was part of the sky. - They're back. - Hey Zenny, I'm home, I'm home. - Abu! - You're flying Mister... He let's you fly his kite? - He's gone, Abu. Mr. Yamanaka's gone. - Gone? Why? - He had to. But he left his kites. All of 'em. - Is he all right? - I don't know. I hope so. - He asked us to fly his kites for him. (gentle music) - It's good having a daughter, even just for summer. (speaking in Japanese) - Come on, Rinko. - I'll come back anytime you need me. Until your real daughter comes back. Don't forget though, keep the barn clean, feed the chickens first before anything else. You can use tea leaves to keep the dust down when you're sweeping the kitchen. - Rinko, are you coming or no? - Yes, Papa, I just have to... - You just have to wait, Rinko. Next summer's a long time away. - Next summer? You mean I can come back? - Of course, Rinko. Of course. You come back anytime. (laughs) - Thank you, Auntie Hata. I can't wait. - [Aunt Hata] Thank you, thank you. - Let's go before it gets dark. Zenny. (gentle music) (engine starting) - [Rinko] Goodbye Mr. Hata. - Mr. Hata? You must have caught being crazy from Mrs. Hata, Evangeline. - Don't call me that. My name is Rinko. Rinko Tsujimura. And that was the summer I realized, that bad things aren't always bad. Sometimes they turn out to be good. Like going to Auntie Hata's. I thought it would be terrible. But it turned out to be the best bad thing that ever happened to me. And that's an absolutely true fact. (gentle music)
