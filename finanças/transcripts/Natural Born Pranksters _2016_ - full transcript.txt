Dude get off me! Yesterday during the final, a guy ran out to the field with the phrase, "natural born prankster" written on his chest. Nothing says "good clean fun" like spending the night in a Brazilian prison. That just... oh! Hey, what's up buddy? It's snowing outside man, not a whole lot. Ugh! I know. I got some good news, though. Call Vitaly. All right, hold on. - Hello? - Yo, v, you waking up at 2 P.M.? Come on. Two girls in my bed, you know the deal. - Yeah, right. Listen, I got some good news. - What? We're making a movie. The guy called, he wants to make the movie. - A porn movie? - Not a porn... Like an actual movie, a prank movie. Get rid of them chicks, we're bringing the dicks. Real 92.3, la's hip hop and R&B, it's your partner big boy, the voice of Los Angeles, matter of fact, la. We looking at some beautiful weather man, it's gonna be sunny. But let me tell you all, those boys from Ohio and that crazy ass Russian, they are on their way to Los Angeles. So, with that being said, watch your back. You have been warned. All right, so here we go. So, at 8:00, you're gonna have your first person here. We expect all these people to be prompt. They've been told that the person who lives here, John, which is each one of you. - So we're John every time? - You're John every time. You don't really know me. Your boss lined this up. Your boss can be an agent, a manager. You guys can be yourselves if you want. So, hopefully these people will be on time. Thanks a lot for coming by. - My normal girl's out of town. - Cool. - What do we do for a living? - I'm all jammed up. - Whatever you want. That's where you can improv. - Okay. Oh, it looks so good. Okay, go. - How does that work? - Boner prank, take one. Can you hold it with your legs and kind of let it go later? Can you, like, put your legs together and hold it? Oh, she's here. She's here. Hey, she's hot. - Oh, hi. How are you? - Hi. Good. How are you? - I'm John. - Nicole. Nice to meet you. Thank you so much for coming. Oh! I've just been so tight. - Do you do a lot of massages or... - Mmm-hmm. - That's all you do? - Yeah. Ah, that's perfect. Just the right amount of friction, too. - No way! - She's looking at it? Yeah, look. - How long have you been doing this? - About five years. Oh my god. You smell so good. - Thanks. - Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, yeah! Still a little harder. - What's up? - Nothing.

How often do you get treatments? - Usually like, once a week. - Uh-huh. But usually by a female, never a male. - Well... - But I heard male hands are nicer and stronger and they can really, you know, do what needs to be done. You... - I usually work exclusively on women, but... - Oh! I don't mind working on you, and... Wow, you've got a hot body. - You take off your shirt. That's awesome. - I'm 62. 62? You look great. What the fuck? Whoo! I love it. You energize. Yeah. - I'm an energy kinda worker, too. - Oh, yeah. - Are you uncomfortable? You look a little bit. - Not at all. - Let's make some eye contact. - Okay, sure. - I have no problem with that. - All right. Yeah, I'm just gonna put my arms out like that. Keep going. You can do whatever you want, man. - Just keep going. - I'll work around it. I never had somebody touch me like that. That's cool. Sorry about that. You can take your jeans off. If you're cool with that. We're in the house, dude. Just jeans off if you're fine with that. You know, I would feel more comfortable - if you take your jeans off. - Really? Oh, great! Shut up. Shut up. What was that? Oh, I'm just talking about my job. I almost got fired today. Wow. That's tough being, you know, in a position where you might get fired. Let me see your butt. So, how many... How many males did you ever have sex with? - None. - Really? - Yeah. - Oh, wow. - I'm not... - What if I just give you one kiss? Whoa, my boner's going crazy. Fuck! What's this? Hey, welcome to tailpipe dreams, man. Tell the camera your name and what kind of car do you have? My name is Joey alcazar. I have a 1958 Chevy del ray. My name's angel antunez. They call me bullet. My car, primeros, '68 Chevy impala convertible. And why do they call you bullet? You don't want to know. Robert salinas, aka Hollywood. I have a 1964 Cadillac convertible. And so, how long have you had this Cadillac? I probably had it about 15 years. Well dude, it matches you. - Yeah. - It's like a good match. That's why they call me Mr. Hollywood. Ah, that's good, man. So, what do you enjoy about your car? What do you love to do with your car? You know, I just got into the uso car club a couple years ago. We just love the family that we build in, you know? And you know, when we see each other, it's like we've known each other for years. Hey! Wait. Hey!

What are you doing today? I'm gonna shit all over a canvas. Look at this. Is this how you prepare to shit? Yeah, this and then the two... The two chili dogs from last night that haven't come out yet. - Dude, your... - So we're gonna have two canvases out there. If you guys have to barf, make sure you barf on the canvas. We gonna paint? All right. Hi. Hi. My name is Joseph. I'm the lucky one who gets to be presenting to you some of this beautiful art, and we are honored to have some guests with us. You haven't met them yet. This is Rome. Hi. Nice to meet you. This is art. And this is Dan, and Dan where are you from? - Turkey. - Turkey. And they are part of a group of artists that I have decided to represent. The main artist who, who could not be here, is working on his next piece. He finds inside of himself something, that I think, most artists just throw away. They discard, they don't think about it as art. I think he finds it to be something that you can create, and you can find within yourself also. Did everybody get a ticket tonight? Everybody got a blue ticket, correct? Did everybody get one? - Everybody's good, right? - Somebody's gonna be a lucky winner tonight. You are gonna get to win this piece of art right here. I hope I don't see it on ebay. Oh, no. Now let's remember that the last two pieces of art, one went for $18,000 to a man from France. And the other piece went for $27,000 to a collector up in northridge. Okay? This piece here is beyond those pieces, beyond. Okay, so... Whoo. Let's see who's gonna be the lucky winner tonight. Okay? That's it. Let's hear it. Um... Let me get one from the bottom. The lucky winner of tonight's painting is number 519 096. Right here. Are you serious? You're so lucky. You are so lucky. So amazing. This piece of art, it's different, it's new, it's original. You ready? Okay. Oh, wow. - Thank you. - Don't be afraid of different. This is real art. - What's that smell? - I want to show you how this art is created. We have a video of our artist, working on this particular piece. Okay, everybody. Watch. My art comes from a place deep inside me. A blank canvas so full of potential, there to receive my paint and my brush strokes. Through my art, I express myself. My art is all of me. All of my soul explodes onto that canvas. In that sense, I am my art. We just love what we do. Please take the painting. - Take the painting. - No, no, no. - Please take it. - Listen to me. Don't let fluffy fool you up in here. Maybe this video will change your mind. Maybe this video will change your mind. This is how we actually made the painting. This is the actual painting we're giving you. Poo-tella. That's right, poo-tella. All right. Ta-da. It's a piece of shit. See, right there. We can make anyone believe anything. It's Nutella and peanut butter. It's peanut butter and hazelnuts. Why was I smelling shit? It's from that. Yeah, the fan. That cup's full of, like, liquid smell. Oh my, god, you guys. High five, man! Say cheese! Oh lord, have mercy, sister Mary Joseph. How are you? Listen, we're doing a photo shoot for the movie, and they want you to... Vitaly, can you speak slowly, please?

All right, listen, can you come here today for some photo shoot, to the office, please, - and bring, like, maybe two, three outfits? - Okay. Oh. I don't know what to say, then.

Why, are we closing this? - Yeah, let's... - Let's hang out. She should be here, five minutes. Yo, you better get her a kick-ass mother's day gift this year. - When is mother's day? - I don't know. It's in may, but you're gonna have to really go heavy on the gift this year. Nah, she doesn't even care, dude. This is it, bro. Magic. Please go off. What's up, beautiful? Finally. Looking good.
