-Standard four-by-four groove. -Sure... entry chord, D major? Rob doesn't know a thing about keyboards. He begins every song in D major Adi, have you written any lyrics? -Yeah. -You know, there are so many things in life we hardly think of.. Simple things Why is the sky blue? Why is water so wet? Why is the earth round? And so on and so forth. Rob, let's start it with a good riff. Then I'll introduce texture.. How's that, KD? Joe starts with the riff, then keyboards... I'll kick in with the drums and then Aditya, you can take over No one takes over in this band That's why we're called Magik Why is the sky blue? Why is water wet? Why is the earth round? What makes silk soft? What makes fire hot? Why doesn't two and two make five? Why are trees vanishing? Why do we have three seasons? Why don't we have two moons? Why is there war? Why flows the red? And borders everywhere? Ever wondered... have you? Ever wondered... what's this all about? Ever wondered...? If you haven't, then do it now Why do all rivers flow? What's light, d'you know? What makes snow fall? Why do friends keep falling out? Why do stars fall? Why is there lightning in clouds? Ever wondered... have you? Ever wondered... what's this all about? Ever wondered...? If you haven't, then do it now Silence can't be heard And the wind can't be seen Ever wondered... why does it happen? Why skies are blue? Why is water wet? Why is the earth round? What makes silk soft? What makes fire hot? Why don't two and two make five? Why are trees vanishing? Why are there only three seasons? Why aren't there two moons? Why is there war? Why flows the red? Why are borders everywhere? Ever wondered... have you? Ever wondered... what's this all about? Ever wondered...? If you haven't, then do it now Ever wondered... have you? Ever wondered... what's this all about? Ever wondered...? If you haven't, then do it now A son tells his father, "Papa, Mummy thinks you're an angel" The father asks, "Really, Mummy said that?" The son says, "She said, you've sprouted wings" Come on, Andy. It's time for bed. You'll be late for school tomorrow Come on The flute you used in this song ...it's fantastic! It'll drive people crazy. They'll go mad! Anyway, can I go now, Anu-ji? Devika asked if we're going to join them in Alibaug for the weekend I won't be able to make it. You should go She has invited both of us. Please, come on Adi It's been over a year since we went on holiday I might go to Hong Kong in August Come along.. If you wish Good morning, sir Come -Who was that? -Met him in Goa at Singhi's party Followed me all the way to Bombay In single-minded pursuit? Who knows, he might write a chapter on me That's creative types for you Anyway, Aditya and you are coming to Alibaug, aren't you? No... Aditya can't come God! Is he married to you or his job? Hey, did I say something wrong? I mean... you're neither interested in what I say, nor in what I design? Are they so awful? Sometimes when I see you... I feel jealous You're living the life you want An interior designer... independent With writers chasing you all the way from Goa You're saying this? You are happily married, making a home Remember, it was you who told me, "I'm happily married" Yes, happily married and... perhaps a mother soon Aditya must be jumping with joy... No... l haven't told him yet I thought, before l shock him with it, I'd better confirm with a gynecologist What shock? Don't you two want a baby? No, that's not it... It's just that... only Aditya knows what he does or doesn't want When I think of it, it's like living with a stranger.. ..who loves me, who cares for me.. ..but I'll never know what's in his heart and soul You'll only find stock market quotes I don't know Devika, maybe I'm just nervous about this baby Anyway, I'll have to tell him, sooner or later... ..maybe on his birthday. -Next week, isn't it? I want to buy him a gift. -Have you had lunch? -I've been waiting for you You remember your promise ... the new tune But I'll teach it to you, only when you play the earlier tune without mistakes Come on, before Mummy goes... Deliver the goods to Kadam's right now And come back with the money, even if you have to wait all day But get the money today. Got it? Now go Leave the goods here. Come and take your money tomorrow Madam, l need the money now Why do you hassle me every day? Didn't I tell you? Come tomorrow at eleven -Eleven o'clock? -Yes -For sure? -Yes -Andy, how was school today? -Like it is everyday Funny. Sit down for lunch The fisherwomen were here again. They really hound me How much they complain! What do I do? There's less fish, the rates are lower,. ..the wholesale rate is down. What profit? Same old fish again... ..every day the same, same food Sorry Nana, I can't do any better Doing the accounts all day, listening to the fisherwomen... Where's the time to cook? I mean, just smell my hands, Joe This goddamn fish smell never goes! Did Lionel call you back about that show? No Why don't you call him? Joe please, we need the money. There're endless bills to pay But no one watches Lionel Uncle's shows. He doesn't even know how to tune a guitar Playing the guitar there won't demean you in any way We Mascarenhas' have never done anything so cheap Why haven't you sent the necklace set? You were responsible for the delivery Girish Bhai has called four times today. What do I say to him? Kedar...? Do you think, saying sorry makes it okay? You'll deliver it personally this evening. Understood? Go Devika, this is perfect Give me Girish Bhai's package Can you inscribe "Aditya" on the back? And 22nd July Aditya, 22nd July? Why? Can't it be done? It's not that... Actually, I had a friend, Aditya. His birthday is also on 22nd July This Aditya...? He's my husband His full name? Aditya Shroff Aditya Shroff... Is he fair and lean.. Has long hair, short sighted but won't wear specs... and writes wonderful poetry? Poetry? You're definitely talking of some other Aditya I'm sorry, I think I got carried away It'll be ready by day after... right? Same name, same birthday...? -Too much of a coincidence. -You're right What's your name? I'll tell my husband Killer Drummer. If he's the same Aditya, he'll know Jignesh Bhai, have you ever been unhappy about your investments with us? It's a done deal, boss We manage most of the foreign investments in the market We're picking up huge stakes in the infrastructure sector Yes... India is booming, sir Sleep without a care. Your wealth is in safe hands Sure My best to your wife. God be with you Mr. Bajaj would like to meet you on the fourteenth floor The management has decided to promote you Why don't we celebrate your promotion and birthday together? No, don't bother throwing a party I'll just take my colleagues out to lunch tomorrow Whenever you make any plans, it's with your colleagues Is your social life incomplete without them? Sakshi... that's life By the way, a strange thing happened today Do you know any Killer Drummer? Do you know a guy called Killer Drummer? No Killer Drummer... strange name, isn't it? Where did you meet him? At a jewellery store Devika needed to buy something and we were talking about you ... and he said he knew an Aditya Shroff who wrote poetry And as we spoke, I discovered that the other Aditya Shroff's birthday... is also on 22nd July Strange, isn't it? Sleep now Sinbad the Sailor sailed away one day... looking for his... na na na na... way One minute... Not quite right? Shall we try something new, Rob? KD, you start and I'll join you on the fourth bar Joe broke the glass Debbie boxed his ears We all laughed at how you got stuck And just like that, Joe left the band Packed my business cards? -Yeah Namdeo Where were you? Get another bag Adi, you go on I'll send your suitcase to the office Okay, get another bag from the loft Wait... Iâ€™ll come too God knows what junk is up there Take this box out, give it away Wait... these too What's that package up there? Bring it down Put it here Open it Okay, I'll check it I left some papers on the side table. Please put them away, they're important So, I was right! Where is Aditya these days? What's he doing now? -You should have brought him along. -He's away in Delhi I'm planning a surprise party at home for him on May 22nd If you and the rest of your band can come, it'll be great We should've had a reunion a long time ago But I had no idea that Aditya was in Bombay And it's been ages since I've spoken to Rob and Joe Anyway, did Aditya say anything about us? No, I was hoping you'd tell me more -I found these. -Oh my God! It's impossible to recognise him And this is you? You're looking so wild Everything's changed, my hairstyle most definitely That's Joe. Our lead guitarist Aditya always said, Joe's fingers made magik Joe said the same about Aditya's voice That's why our band was called Magik Magik? You know, when Aditya arrived in Bombay, he lived with Joe for three months Rob, he is our band's backbone He did all the programming and the bass sections I'm sure you know this poet Suddenly, one day he says, "Let's go to Goa" No packing, nothing. Just go And we just set off Aditya's dream, was that Magik would have a tour bus and we'd just head off There'd be no turning back And all of us believed it would turn out exactly like that In our twenties, we think the world will dance to our tune Sorry, I'm boring you with all this talk No. You've told me so much. Thanks I'll talk to Rob and Joe. I can't guarantee they'll come But I'll definitely come. -Please try and bring them What was it 241 2 3489 or 59? It takes you so long to pick up the phone? Yes -Where are you? -When can you meet me? -Just tell me where. -Jazz by the bay. Nine thirty KD, turn down the volume That was my friend from Channel V. I styled some of his shows He called with some special news -You're really lucky -Shut up, KD There's going to be a contest The winning band gets to cut an album and make a music video We'll need new equipment Good cymbals for KD. A new mike for you, Adi You need a new distortion pedal And for me, another tea Uncle Khursheed, one more tea In all, we'll need about fifty five thousand The band's savings are twenty thousand Maybe I can wangle five thousand from dad That makes twenty five thousand. Which leaves... Thirty thousand. Einstein! I have some cash... ..about three or four thousand... -Really? I can give you that I've got about the same Adi, can't you ask your Dad? He won't give it. I know Punishing me for not doing an MBA Dads... There's a way out. Raghav Yedekar Sounds like a goon... He organizes shows. Music from old films Totally different from our music The audience is different too Old film music? We'll need a sitar, harmonium, ten tabalas! Guitars and keyboards won't do Really Rob, I can't do it either Hang on, Joe Who says we can't play old songs on guitars and drums? We'll choose our songs and do them in our style With the Magik touch Like breath is needed... Like breath is needed for life Yes, a sweetheart is needed, for love Like a flame is needed, Like a flame is needed, for light Yes, a sweetheart is needed, for love This day comes, in the season of youth When eyes meet eyes, even water catches fire This day comes, in the season of youth I'm going to take you high, my baby Fly with me Fly high So, Aditya doesn't know about the party? That's what a surprise is all about Let's see how he takes the surprise -I'm in. -Good So what other news...? Saw an ad on TV some time ago, the music sounded like yours You're really lucky, Rob Still making music after all these years Don't know how to do anything else, KD And you? Still drumming? I don't remember the last time I touched drumsticks But now you can afford the world's best drum kit Yes, I can -And l don't even have to go to a Dandiya-dance. -Dandiya? Yeah! We bought equipment out of our performance at the Dandiya! How can I tell you... what my heart says You'd think, maybe I'm insane How can I tell you what my heart says You'd think, maybe I'm insane I want to get to the top of the TV tower Scream out loud and say... Rock On! It's the sign of the times Rock On! Every moment beckons Rock On! What are you waiting for Rock On! You only live once My heart tells me... to scream out loud Everyone.. should open their windows Then I'll sing them my spirited songs Let them join in and raise the cry Rock On!

You only live once Just live your life... the way you always wanted to All I've got to say is... make every single one of your dreams come true! Welcome to Channel V's Launchpad From Bangalore, this is Chakravyuh The world's full of snakes They bite everyone Sitting upon their coils Hood outstretched Snakes hiss Toxic Blacks, blues, yellows Eyes of stone... and sharp fangs The world is a jungle of snakes There's a hood in every face Sitting upon their coils, hood outstretched, hissing, waiting to strike Toxic! Blacks, blues, yellows Eyes of stone... and sharp fangs All right! Let's hear it for Chakravyuh Now, our next band, from right here in Bombay Fans say, there's magik in their music Bombay, are you ready for them? That's more like it Let's welcome on stage, Magik I need your help for the next song Will you sing with me? Put your hands together Everybody, sing with me Way to go Now... sing when I raise my hand One of my laundry bills... An unfinished novel... A girl's phone number... A useful piece of paper... In my deck, a king of hearts... And one of my silver rings... When I look at what I lost this last week Some days I laughed at myself and some days I cried One of my laundry bills An unfinished novel A girl's phone number A useful piece of paper In my deck, a king of hearts And one of my silver rings When I look at what I lost this last week Some days I laughed at myself Some days I cried I got a gift, a watch... that I loved so much A packet of Mary Jane My old denim jacket Two passes for a cricket match My brand new sunglasses When I look at what I lost this last week Some days I laughed at myself and some days I cried How... do I forget? On day seven, someone introduced you to me at a party What was in the moment... when I saw you for the first time When we first met... I felt what love was I lost my senses... and my heart too Some days I laughed at myself and some days I cried That was everything I lost this last week Put your hands together One of my laundry bills An unfinished novel A girl's phone number A useful piece of paper One of my laundry bills An unfinished novel A girl's phone number A useful piece of paper When I met you first I felt.. what love was I lost my senses and my heart too Some days I laughed at myself and some days I cried Now's the time to find out who the winner of the contest is The winners get an album contract. And at least one music video I'm all nerves Can you tell... ..which lucky band's name is in this envelope? Magik Picture this... Someone insults Aditya and Joe breaks out in a rash And now... Where's Joe these days? Ran into him some months ago, at Purple Haze Studio He has so much talent, but business sense... zero Joe... when will he learn it's important to market oneself? Let's go meet him It'll be great if you invite him to Aditya's party No, don't try to use me to do this Come on Rob, you always knew how to handle them I mean, that was why we tolerated you in the band Anybody in? -Oh my God... -KD? -Wow... Joe! How are you? How're you doing? All okay? Getting along I teach guitar to kids in the neighbourhood And once in a while, I perform live at a club -It's all good, man -Good? You're still performing on stage! That's fantastic, Joe It's nothing like those concerts Here, people hang around, party, talk, drink What I'm playing makes no difference to them I played in a club once I got so angry, felt like hurling my keyboard at the crowd You should have That way your keyboard would've been of some use Did you know Aditya is also here in Bombay Really...? No... how would I know? His wife came to my store And... She has invited us home For Aditya's birthday party 22nd...? Look who's here -Who's this? -Andrew Magik's drummer? -How old is he? -He'll turn eight this year Debbie, I'll hand it to you! You don't look like the mother of an eight year old But in that outfit, you look like a typical businessman Even Rob looks different in his close crop, doesn't he? Long hair is no longer in fashion You're saying this? Someone who'd brush his hair before brushing his teeth! Why don't you just admit it, you're losing your hair Show me how you'd flick the sticks in the air and catch them -Hey, who told you? -Who else? At bedtime, Andy listens to only one story. Magik's Debbie, we're planning a reunion. Next week. At Aditya's Why don't you join us and bring Andrew along Reunion? So the two of you are here with a message from Aditya, the star? It's not like that, Debbie All these years you weren't even in touch. Why now? Debbie is really stressed out because of work She doesn't mean it, you know that Next time, I'll show you the magik of drumsticks Say bye, Andy It'll be good if you guys come. Think about it. Okay? They come around after years, that too with an invite from Aditya If it was so important, couldn't he have phoned himself? It's a surprise party, Debbie. His wife is organizing it Keep away from them Being with them was always bad for you Last time, you got hurt God knows what they want now! Nobody hurt me I was the one who quit You're defending them now? So they call and you go, tail wagging? Is that right? No, Debbie I'll wear a collar and stay right by you. You think that I...? Do whatever you want Listen, you better tell the music company that I'm styling Magik's video Or you'll end up wearing these shorts and a T-shirt What's wrong with my shorts? Showing my legs only adds to the sex appeal of the video This is our big break Our lottery ticket to the future Now we have to get the right numbers When you're around... I feel like... I've found every joy When you're gone... It feels like... every joy has faded Youâ€™re the one... my life needs You're a poet and we didn't even know it It's a great tune We need another song for the album and l think we've found it Yes, Adi? I want to dedicate it to Debbie It'll be your wedding anthem When it's played in church, all will rise Tell me seriously, what do you think of the song? And when you sing it in your style, it'll be even better Thanks, brother Adi... When we meet the music company guys, make sure you tell them about Debbie styling our music video You could tell them yourself Yeah, but she's my girlfriend and... it'll be a little odd You'll tell them, won't you? Of course, I will Here's your gift There's another surprise for you We're not ghosts I'll join you Just... take care of them Thanks for coming. I'm glad you came Aditya is happy too, of course He's forever busy with work I hope you're fine? Yes, we're good Your drink...? -I'm fine, thank you Your friends are getting bored What do I do? We have other guests as well All right, I'm going When did you pick up this habit? Well... Cigarettes are rotten for your voice What does my voice have to do with investment banking? Remember losing your voice before a show once, in college... and Debbie forcing you to drink that re-mixed herbal tonic I'll never forget your face Whatever it was, it was effective She also gave you some medicine to improve memory, didn't she? Didn't help, did it? What do you mean? I still remember, she was the one Joe didn't come? -Must be on his way... Why don't you call him and check where he is? Obviously, Sakshi doesn't know much about Magik Never felt the need to tell her sometimes, it feels as if it all happened in another lifetime... and sometimes as if, just yesterday Why don't we get together again at our old rehearsal pad? Sounds like a great idea Tomorrow's Sunday. Let's do it But first, we'll meet at Army Cafe Come off it One o'clock? Come on. Rob, you, me... even Joe will turn up The four of us, together again Why do we need four? Even two or three can jam together But it won't be Magik I wish your friend Joe had come How did you like meeting your friends? Sakshi, you shouldn't have invited them Why? Why did you tell me that you didn't know them? Because I don't know them anymore We have drifted apart You saw it too... how uncomfortable they were They were our guests And guests feel as comfortable as we make them I felt you were the uncomfortable one Why are you getting involved in these things? Just let it be Look... Isn't that you? I thought that if you met your friends again, you'd feel good Maybe, it would bring back this smile Why are you spying? Spying? I want to see you happy By going through my things? Stop it! What's come over you? Look at yourself! What you were, what you've become? In ten years, people change I'm not the Aditya you see in these pictures You're right... the man in these pictures is happy I'm happy even today If you're happy, then why don't l feel it? Why does it feel like you're living a mechanical life? Now you have a problem with my life? Not I. You have a problem with your life That's why you keep me at a distance Why do you feel so bad about me seeing these pictures? These pictures mean nothing Then why have you kept them so carefully? -You could have thrown them away or burnt them. -Is that it? Destroy them. Makes no difference to me I cut these ties a long time ago Maybe you lost a lot when you cut these ties? -Have you thought of that? -What have l lost? Only you know that If something's disturbing you... Damn it, Sakshi! Think what you want Ten years ago, I chose this life Yes, I made some compromises... but who doesn't? Am I one of the compromises in your life? Is our marriage also a compromise? -That's not what I meant... -That's exactly what it is, Aditya Don't you see, you're angry with yourself And your anger is hurting our relationship I want to be a part of your life But how is it possible when you're living only half a life! And to make my life complete, you invited them here? I made a mistake I thought you'd be happy to meet your friends And then I was going to tell you that you're going to be a father What? Yes Aditya. But what a pity... Now I don't even know, if hearing this makes you happy or not "I'm going to Mum's house." "I need time to think." Hello, Nana I knew I'd find you here Why didn't you come yesterday? You know why No Joe, I don't know Look, whatever happened ten years ago affected all our lives The difference is, KD and I accepted it But you couldn't And guess what, nor has Aditya Success, failure... these things come and go We got together to fulfill our dream, our passion to create music But you forgot that Being successful was most important for you Isn't success important? Don't you see that your success lay in Magik's success? Imagine, where we'd all be today if all that hadn't happened What do you want from me? What can I do now? We're meeting today. One o'clock, at Uncle Khursheed's cafe Life doesn't give everyone a second chance One o'clock. See you there Clean up table number two. -All right Uncle Khursheed... Recognise me? No One tea, please Dilip, one tea Thank you Did Adi have to be late today of all days? -There -Sorry I'm late, guys Come on... only two minutes left Breathe, man Don't forget to tell them about Debbie -Don't forget man, it's really important -I won't forget, Joe Please! Don't make me more nervous. Come on Okay So how do you feel? We're confident. Just show us the way to the recording studio Look kids... just recording the music doesn't make it a hit Music must cater to public taste But... you liked our music, didn't you? It's good... But could be better... much, much, much better A popular number I'll get it from you, of course October to January is the wedding season, right? Let's take a hit wedding song... and do a rock remix But... a wedding remix in a rock album...? Why... is it against the law to do that? Everything goes The main thing is, the album should be a hit We'll take the slow song out... it won't work You know, the one which goes, "If you're there, I'm here or not here..." It's the only soft, romantic ballad that gives our album some depth Nowadays this doesn't sell, kid Tempo... give me tempo Today's youth want songs with tempo, bubbly stuff If you agree with what I'm saying... Here's the contract You see boys... In life, one needs to make some compromises Seven out of eight songs are of your choice And one... that I want Besides, there's no dearth of talent in the market Well done. Congratulations Another thing. We have a friend, Debbie. She does costumes and styling We were hoping, you could use her for our music video Relax! Now you're the responsibility of this company Forget all these people At least meet her once You get to work in the recording studio and let us do our work I feel terrible about Joe's song being rejected It's not just about my song It's our debut album To push a stupid remix into it... I think we're making a very big compromise In that case, we shouldn't have signed But now that we have, there's really no point in talking about it If we hadn't done it, someone else would have I'm so sorry about your song, Joe. No. I'm sorry, Debbie They won't let you do the styling They say, they already have someone But they haven't even seen her work! Seven out of eight songs selected. It's not that bad Unfortunately, we need them now Once this album is a hit, we'll be free to do whatever we want You're about to record your first album. What more do we want? Sweetheart, it leaves me cold Do something, darling So why don't you tell me what to play. I'll do as you say Go on Mr. Sukhani... Have you worked on a lot of albums? Boss, l tell you... the Subhash Ghai film Karz, starring Rishi Kapoor... All of you, out Now, Aditya's close ups Your shot's done? But you just went in... Aditya's close ups again We look like clowns in these clothes. Why couldn't they let you style us? And this director... keeps asking me to jump If I keep jumping, when will I play the keyboards? Aditya, take a break. What's the matter? You'd see what the matter is Aditya... if you'd only take off your rock star shades What... maybe you didn't notice? The director's focusing only on you The three of us are in the background, like sidekicks That too in these costumes. -Do we look like a rock band? -Do you think Iâ€™m happy in these clothes? Drop it, Joe Aditya is our lead singer he has to be the focus Whatever's happening here, isn't right No one takes over in Magik! Remember? Your words One chance at getting famous and you forget all your principles Let's talk in the make-up room. Come on, please You think I knew this would happen when we signed the contract? But I'm a professional, Joe. Maybe you should try to be one You've sold out That director was treating us so badly. Did you stop him even once? Hello... what's going on here? This studio doesn't come for free We need a short break. We've got something to discuss Discussions later, darling. The shoot is held up -Come on guys. -Please go away I said, please go away Darling Keep this attitude of yours at home You signed a contract, you'll do as l say Got it? Come on, darling Joe! Have you gone mad? Blood! It's blood! Get lost! I don't want to know! Damn your album! Magik is finished! Pack up! I'll make sure you're finished! I am Sukhani! To hell with your contract... I quit After all these years... nothing's changed here. It's been a long time Joe? You're here after ages! All okay? Fine, Uncle Khursheed. How are you? I'm great, perfect A tea, please. -Sure Prepare a nice tea and bring for him. What a sharp memory. So long, and he still hasn't forgotten It's the guitar. You carry it everywhere So it stays in the mind Are they coming? Bloody hell, man Your jeep is still alive? Of course. Together, in life and death! Was that too much? When did you get here? Ten minutes ago -Where's Adi? Should I call him? -No, KD He'll come if he wants to I don't really understand what happened Everything was perfect and then suddenly, it just all went wrong? Perhaps you never noticed that something was troubling her? Notice what? What does she have to complain about me? For four years, we've shared everything... -What more can I do? -Lots You may have been sharing a home But you aren't sharing your lives Sakshi still feels that you're a stranger.. ..about whom she knows nothing And her feelings got stronger when she discovered those photographs It's been ten years When will it stop chasing me? When you stop running I guess we should go Did you really think he'd come? Shall we try something? Sure Shall we begin? One of my laundry bills... An unfinished novel... A girl's phone number... A useful piece of paper... In my deck, a king of hearts And one of my silver rings... When I... this last... The right pitch is two notes higher Is that so? Why don't you show us? One of my laundry bills... An unfinished novel... A girl's phone number... A useful piece of paper... In my deck, a king of hearts... And one of my silver rings... When I look at what I lost this last week Some days I laughed at myself and some days I cried Sorry, I couldn't make it to your party last night Let's not get too sentimental But not here. Look at the state of this place Why? Too used to air-conditioning now? You've lost your hair, what difference will it make to you? Guys... let's go to my place Anyone coming to help? I'm not twenty five any more You were right, I am upset with life But if you're going to ignore me like this,.. ..my relationship with life will only get worse You were right. I've been living only half a life But if you leave like this, even that half-a-life will be no more Yes you're right, I keep you at a distance But today the distance is so wide that... I'm talking to your answering machine and not to you I never thought this would happen Please come home, Sakshi Good afternoon, sir How are you, Bahadur? -Fine, sir Put it down here Namdeo, get the extension board as well -Adi... here? -Yes I mean, everything looks so perfect here Adi, are you allowed? KD... this is my home Thank you for coming to Magik Re-united's first concert On lead guitar, we have Joe. Nowadays, he attends very few parties Down there... -Okay Our conversations... I wish, they go on forever Our sweet meetings... I hope, they go on forever Remember? Of course, but we never finished composing it. Let's try? One moment... Rob -Remember Sindbad the Sailor? -Yes Scale? In conversations, we'll find new words of love Then, with those words... we'll write a song A song... that fills hearts... all hearts... with love Let our words... become songs And let the words... melt into tunes I didn't know you had so much hidden talent There's a hotshot producer here. Meet him today Sorry, not today. Some other time I have to leave, it's urgent -Are you sure? -Yes To turn sorrow into joy, sing that song of love And anyone who hears our song will say... Sing again Our conversations... I wish, they go on forever Our sweet meetings I hope, they go on forever For all our days and nights... forever In conversations, we'll find new words of love Then, with those words... we'll write a song A song... that fills hearts... all hearts... with love Let our words... become songs And let words... in our conversations... melt into tunes Here. That settles your account Where are you going? You have to pick up Andrew from school Will you pick him up today, please? What's happening? You've been staying out all day I was... going to the studio... I might land some work Studio? Purple Haze, in Bandra. Rob has fixed some meetings Oh... oh really? You keep saying that I ought to look for work So, in the past few weeks I've been doing the rounds of studios Okay... fine Okay... bye I'm on, Rob Hi guys... -Hey, Joe Hi Joe! Look, channel V's talent hunt is up next month, on the 24th Winners get an album contract What do you say? Should we enter? One minute Jamming indoors is one thing, performing on stage is quite another After all these years, can we perform on stage? Why not? What's time got to do with rock and roll? KD, I know you so well. You'll do all this, just to impress girls Sakshi, if it impresses your friend Devika... I have no problem I'll see to it your message reaches her Seriously guys, are we taking part in this contest? I don't know, man But I do Yes, Joe This is my last chance And I don't want to throw it away Just think, it's not as if we have to prove anything to the world If we do this, it's only for ourselves... to finish the journey we began ten years ago For Magik? For Magik Wow! When is the contest? Can I come? I haven't told Mummy about it yet -Why? I want to give her a surprise... So keep it... zipped Debbie... -One second I've something to tell you... Okay, great. Joe's here too. I'll talk to him and call you back That was Sandra. Remember her? Her husband Pete is a chef on the Blue Line Cruise His ship is on a six month voyage, round-the-world They need musicians. The money is very good Pete has already spoken for you. Just contact them So you've planned to exile me? Stop joking! Where will you find a better offer? Just imagine, you get to travel the world The company provides bed and board. All you have to do is play the guitar And make money When is it sailing? On the 24th of next month, l think 24th...? Yes, I think so. But before that you have to do an audition Audition? Joe, come on. They don't know how well you play the guitar I'm telling you, when they hear you, they'll love it Yeah... -You'll get the job really easily Rob has learnt it nicely from Anu Malik We still have our magik touch Steaming hot -That song sounds definitely better. -But it can become... "Much, much, much better" Which reminds me... are we going to Channel V tomorrow? What time? -Four thirty But don't worry. This time, we just fill up some forms A slight headache. It's okay No thanks. I took pills in the morning Pills... what are your plans after the rehearsal? I heard you guys broke up? Guess, I was wrong Actually, we were on a break But now, we're back Getting to see you up on stage will be pretty cool And just look at your luck This time, there's no competition Especially since Chakravyuh has stopped performing You're the lucky one You lost then and this time, you wouldn't stand a chance Well, you can't win everything in life Anyway, the channel is hosting a party tomorrow night for the contestants If you guys are free, why don't you come along? I'm getting tired of being a culture bandit and oh... it's funny and sick recalling all the ways Yesterday, we went for the sonography -It's beautiful. -Yes, it's a great feeling KD, where's Rob? -He should be here anytime Looking good, KD -Thanks And you always look great, Devika "Tanya, after what happened today, it's best that l leave." "When I'll meet you again, I can't say." What are you doing here? The last time we met... was... -Ages How's Debbie? -She's fine Of course, you know each other Remember, he and Joe scrapped... We were so immature Back then, even I thought Ajay was a little weird But after we became friends, I got to know he's a nice guy Tanya, I'm sorry, for leaving the way I did I found your note I knew then, you weren't coming back Then, you knew more about me than I did Yes Let bygones be bygones Come on But at least, you've got a second chance, to perform with Magik Life's rarely this generous with everyone You know, I had put all that music behind me But because of my wife Sakshi, it's happening all over again Tanya, a very old friend of mine -I wanted to thank you -Me? If I hadn't seen your photographs, I'd have never known Aditya had a band First, I was afraid I was petrified I kept thinking, I could never live without you by my side Save the guests. I am coming ..thinking how you did me wrong I grew strong I learnt how to get along And now you're back From outer space I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face I should've changed my stupid lock I would've made you leave your key If Iâ€™d known for just one second you'd be back to bother me Go on now, go... walk out the door Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore Werenâ€™t you the one who tried to break me with your lies You think I'd crumble, you think I'd lay down and die Oh no, not I, I will survive As long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive I've got all my life to live I've got all my love to give And Iâ€™ll survive, I will survive KD... I don't know these songs KD... I only know Hindi songs Strange story it has been Where it began Where will it all end What destinies await us Neither he knows, nor I Strange story it has been, Where it began Where will it all end What destinies await us Neither he knows, nor I Why does smoke... obscure the lamplight? Why does smoke... obscure the lamplight? In my dreams... I have woken up from my dream Talk to him... -But Rob isn't taking my call He must be busy. -But he would answer... Let's go to his place Adi, talk to him. -KD... It's on our way back, let's go there I'll drop you to the car Hang in there You'll be fine, hang in there Adi, take the next right Shit! So what if it's a No Entry? He's passing out Rob, look at me, man... Rob Just hang on... hang on... we're reaching the hospital You'll be fine, you're going to make it You see this? Have you told Rob... that he has brain tumour? He knows He tells me he's had some chemotherapy sessions And he's taking medication too Why didn't he tell us? What good would it do? You'd re-unite Magik thinking, poor Rob's dying I didn't want that If we are to get together again, it has to be because... we believe in Magik's music and we believe in each other But you don't believe we're your friends Isn't that right? It's not that, KD. This tumour has become a part of my brain I'm beyond curing. That's a fact Two days, two months, two years... How much longer will I live...? I'm sick of thinking about that Rob... listen to me Dr Shetty is the country's best neurosurgeon I'll talk to him We'll shift you to his personal clinic You'll be all right. -What the hell are you saying, Aditya? Our show is on the 24th ... day after tomorrow Have you gone mad? This show is very important for me, perhaps my last chance You know how worried I've been? What's wrong with you? After you left, the cruise guys called. Your visa is done The ship is leaving tomorrow and you're going to be on it What's the matter, Joe? And all these days, you were lying to me? This Magik and all this... Can't you see there's no future in it? Whenever it comes to this band, why does your brain switch off, Joe? I don't care You're going on that cruise and that's final I've got another chance to do what I've always wanted to... I don't know how to do anything else And now Rob... -Stop it Joe Agreed, what happened to Rob is terrible But don't you see that your wife.. ..has been dying a slow death for ten years? And Andy... have you ever considered his future? In life, you've got to make compromises I wanted to become a fashion designer I'm working your goddamned family fish-business And what of Magik? You want to be a rock star at your age? Have you learnt nothing in ten years? You're ready to trust the same man again Ms Debbie is here to meet sir Ask her to sit down. I'm coming Welcome You know, I've met your son Andrew Oh... it's showing Yes, there's a glow on your face -Is Aditya in? -Please sit in the study. I'll call him I've been asking Joe about you for ages Sit Will you have a drink? But... you seem to be doing fine, like always Some people have all the luck,.. ..they get whatever they want Like you You were a hero in college, the creative rebel And now, a successful businessman Fantastic house Pretty wife And soon, a father Everything a man can ask for... I can't tell if you're complimenting me or not I'm just speaking the truth Or you can take it this way... I'm pointing out what sets you apart from Joe Joe... Joe isn't lucky like you, Aditya He's fought against life at every step And such was his luck... most often, he failed Please, stop showing him these new dreams Because when these dreams shatter, the shards will wound my life... Andrew's life What are you trying to say? If Joe goes for the show tomorrow,.. ..he'll lose a very good job Just let him go, Aditya. Please He still has fever, 1 02 degrees I'm fine doctor The fever will vanish the moment I get out of here Rob, please be serious They don't become doctors overnight What if something happens on the stage? Guys, if you think so negatively, I'll definitely collapse Imagine... tomorrow, we'll be on stage, there'll be lights, a huge audience There'll be music, in its every beat and every note, there will be life Life I want to live one night to the fullest before l die Don't give up on me! You should save your energy for tomorrow But if I have to go, then why not with a bang You're right My eyes speak of bright stars, colourful places and open meadows My thoughts speak of dancing shores, where I stand alone, waiting for you My dreams feel just like heaven I'm just a traveler passing through My eyes speak of bright stars, colorful places and open meadows My thoughts speak of dancing shores, where I stand alone, waiting for you My dreams feel just like heaven, I'm just a traveler passing through Donâ€™t let this moment pass us by... as we talk Tonight's the night! -Where's Sakshi? -She's watching the concert with Devika Where's Joe? I'm... fully unzipped Saying hear I am take a look at it I'm getting tired of being a culture bandit and oh... it's funny and sick, recalling all the ways... I would paint my face Saying, please come take me oh I'm worthy please I believe, I'll receive love.. ..but 'til then I'm my own biggest fan Where the hell is Joe, man? I don't think Joe'll turn up What do you mean? Debbie came to see me last night She said... Joe's got a job on some ship.. ..and he's leaving I was still hopeful that he'd turn up Even after a decade, Magik is still stuck in the same rut We always get caught in this big ego clash... between you and Joe You the only ones with personal problems? What about us? Forget it That's the problem, I can't let go! Aditya and Joe may be able to We can't go on stage without Joe Why not? If it's vital for Joe to be on that ship, it's vital for me to be on stage And no one can stop me! Even if I have to play the drums for twenty minutes on my own, I'll still go! And you guys decide if you're with me We have to reach the airport in fifteen minutes Magik? Andy, turn around It's been ten years since Magik performed But the wait isn't over yet This song is his and this is for him,.. ..the one who couldn't be here today With you beside me, my heart sings a song Without you, my music is gone If I have you with me, I have everything If you're gone, there's not a thing To have you with me, is to live a wonderful dream When you're around, it feels like... I've found every joy When you're gone, happiness doesn't satisfy me It's my life that's asking, for you Papa, go! When you're with me, I can find my way When you're gone, there is no path When you're here, there is everything Without you, who's left? If you're with me, every moment is bliss When you're with me, I feel even the breeze has the colour of love When you're gone, life is without spirit When I found you, I found life Ladies and gentlemen... please welcome, on lead guitar, My friend, my brother, Joseph Mascarenhas Sinbad the sailor, sailed away one day listen up my friends Looking for a new world in his own way He sailed into uncharted seas He was at the mercy of the waves He was warned not to go to sea listen up my friends Warned that it wasn't such a good dream to see listen up my friends He was rapt in his own dreams And he listened only to his heart For the only thing he owned, was a dream of his own, that dream of Sinbad the sailor For the only thing he owned, was a dream of his own, that dream of Sinbad the sailor A typhoon struck his boat once listen up my friends But he kept his zeal afloat listen up my friends He was such a devotee A dream-walker, that's what he was For the only thing he owned, was a dream of his own, that dream of Sinbad the sailor For the only thing he owned, was a dream of his own, that dream of Sinbad the sailor Thirsting for a dream He kept right on his path The oceans were deep and the waves tall, listen up my friends Where the largest ships sit uneasy, listen up my friends But he reached the shore one day He finally reached his destiny For the only thing he owned, was a dream of his own, that dream of Sinbad the sailor For the only thing he owned, was a dream of his own, that dream of Sinbad the sailor With you beside me, my heart sings a song Without you, my music is gone If I have you with me, I have everything If you're gone, there's not a thing To have you with me, is to live a wonderful dream When you're around, it feels like Iâ€™ve found every joy When you're gone, happiness doesn't satisfy me It's my life that's asking... for you When someone has a dream in his eyes, happiness is a joy in chasing that dream Just for once make a wish from life, then you see When someone has a song on his lips, even a loss seems like a victory The song in your heart... sing it out, just for once... then you see When someone has memories... of love, every night is... filled with dreams Just for once, to someone, give your heart... then you see So see a few dreams, hear a few songs,
