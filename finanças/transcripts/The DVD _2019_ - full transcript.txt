Do you ever think about why? I don’t understand what you’re saying to me. You were killed, Jonathan. Was it by a gangster? It was by you. You couldn’t live with the remorse of killing me. And your love for me. I knew you loved me. That’s why it didn’t hurt. I don’t remember feeling anything. Because you love yourself. You do. I always believed it, even if you didn’t. Even when we were on the run. Avoiding gangs. Avoiding my father. Even when you stayed up all night saying you wanted to commit suicide for all the people you’ve killed. And you’d drink. And you’d hit me. And I’d hit you. And you’d drink some more. And then you’d go out and kill. Just so we could have money. Contract killing jobs, just for me. Freelance contract killing jobs, for me. For us. Stop. I’m glad to know I was right. Even if we can’t be alive, it is good to be right. Why? Because I loved you. What? I loved you. I love you, I love you. Open your eyes, Jonathan. Here we go! William Alexander Genovet. - Name's gonna be known. - That motherfucker. Yeah, that's me. Why are you actin' like I'm not in the room? Yo motherfucker, get some stable hands, they're just, like, Okay, we both filmed stuff, okay? That was you, but! - Well, not all of it. - Don't, don't be, yeah, but that exact shot was you, don't be putting it on me! I like the trees in that part. Yeah. Artifact of a love. I, I hate this font. It's an artsy font. It's, like, it's a good font. It's not boring. What do you want, Times New Roman? - There she is! - Oh yeah. Courtney! Like, the I in Sai looks like an L. Yeah, but that's your fault for having an I at the end of your name. Motherfucker, that's your fault because you can't pick a good font! My name looks awesome. Look at that. Yeah. William Alexander Genovet. It only looks awesome, it's not. - Yes, it is. - That's the only awesome part about it. Okay. Sure. Yo, how long is this shit? It's the opening titles. Like, it's who worked on the film. Look, I directed this film, so, keep that in mind. Did you not know that? Was that an afterthought you just had? No, but when you see this wonderful piece of art, - Yeah, with the shaky hands at the start of it! - It should just be, just, That one shot, - you had one job in that shot. - Okay, shut up, here we go. Look, that's me. Oh, pathetic acting, here we come. 'Pathetic acting'. I did fine. I think I did a good job. That's one of the parts I'm proud of, of this film. Yeah. I'll let you think that. Wait, wait, wait, it's coming. Boom! - There she is. - Oh. Look at her run. We should have got a close up of that. Yeah. Her ass, running. Motherfucker. Look at her, there she goes. Again, we cut out the ass, - what were we doing? - Yeah. Who the fuck was filming that? You know, you probably did it, because I probably ran, right, right? Didn't I run right after her? You probably filmed that. Look, now I'm looking for her. Well, you should have told me you wanted a close up. Oh, there she is again. Now she's like, in darkness. You can barely see. Yeah. The lighting sucks. Yo, she is like, like she's a good actress, but, like, just as a girl, like, I look like a priest. I know, you do. With the black and the little white. Totally against who you actually are, though! Yo, shut up. It was really cool shooting in the park, it was a great great environment. She has nice hair, too. Yeah. Everything about her, man. It matches the trees. And her shirt is all, like, the top, Oh, here you come. Yeah. There you are, big tough guy. Ha ha! What was that? 'Ha ha'! Yo, motherfucker, just watch the film, okay, - just watch the film. - I am. I'm watching Courtney especially. - Best part, uh, - That's the only thing worth watching. No it's not! It's a good film. And she is good lookin'. Oof. What are you zooming into there? I was zooming in! I wanted to look! And that was you, can I, that was your shot! You used that cut, you could've used a different cut! I bet you, I bet you fucked all of them up equally. No I didn't, okay? Yes you did! Oh, those eyes. Mhm. Nice big eyes. Nice lips! Bet those are good for a lot. Fuckin' asshole. Can I not imagine? Can I not dream? You can! Who's stopping you? Go all wild! It's not like I give a shit! Imagine, we got like, a nude scene in there? Yeah. That's all you got to say? Well, I'm imagining it, motherfucker! I wonder if she'd be down for that, like, Yeah. I don't know. Like, with a body like that, I mean, I don't know. - How can you not? Like, - Yeah. Don't you wanna show that off? Yeah. I would. If I was her. I'd be lookin' at myself all day long. Yeah. She was really cool. Yeah. Well, she IS really cool. Yeah. Wish we coulda got a kiss scene in there somewhere. - Yeah. - Woulda been awesome. Well, we coulda gone further. I wish we had, but, you know? Only so much you can do. Yo, man, but I, I have to say, this is so much better than like, what the other people are makin' out there. - I know, like, - Yeah. This is a good, like, we did a good job, I mean, I'll give you that some, some of it's, like, shaky, blurry, there's lighting whatever, but, it's like, a nice environment, and, - Yeah. - I don't know, I like the script and all that, and, - Yeah. - That's one of my favorite parts. I, just the ending overall, I really love. - And this quote. - Yep, Martin Luther King! With your shaky hands in the background! It's not supposed to be a tripod shot, okay? Like, it's, it's a handheld shot. Like, calm down. Plus, the focus isn't on the sky, it's on the font. - Well, not the font, I'm sorry, the text! - What! - What the fuck! - You know what I mean, there we go, Artifact of a Love, - there's the title. - Still hate the font. Okay, well, I still love it. You know, you cold have voiced your opinion on the font, like, during editing, it's not like I didn't show you anything. You didn't give me a choice for font! You were so adamant on this one! Because you wanted boring ones! - Like, you could have picked a different, - So, what, what's the problem with simplicity? Because, a simple, you don't want Times, that's what everybody else does. Be different. Yeah, but different doesn't mean making Sai 'Sal'. There's a dot above it, okay? No L has a dot above it, it's obvious it says Sai. Yeah, yeah. Courtney Tane! Oh yeah. There she is. Yeah, there you are. That says Sai, shut up. It says Sal, okay? Shut up. Like, I get it has a tail, but that's just cursive. That's just dumb, is what it is! Okay, just cause you cant read, like, a - you know, fancier font, doesn't mean it's bad. - Oh, just shut up, okay? It's not a fancy font, it's a dumb font. No, cause see all those trees in there? That was all me. Director of, uh, Cinematography. Yeah. That was all me. All the fuckin' Stupid shots and lighting that we had, that was all you! I'm proud of it, man. I mean, I, I don't know, I really like the film, like, and the music, yeah, the music was a, like, I felt like we actually found some pretty good stuff. Yeah. I think it fit the tone, and, Uh huh. I don't know. Overall, I mean, I think we actually did a really good job with, um, I don't know. I mean, we kept it simple, but, it was interesting, and, um, - Eh. - Like you said, it's better than what other people are makin', like, - this is good. - Yeah. Like, it has its flaws, but, so does every other film. Yo, when the, - What? - What the fuck were you thinking when you It's, yo, that's like, it's true. The end. I'm proud of it. Hey! I am William Alexander Genovet, this is actress Courtney Tane, uh, we are here about to start filming ‘Artifact of a Love’. There’s Courtney. There she is. Um, she’s signing the release form right now, just for this, uh, production. Hi. How’s it going? Good. You uh, you excited? Yeah. Cool. Look! We found my dick in the woods while we were filming. See? Had you lost it? Yeah man, I, uh, this thing goes all over the place, you know, sometimes I can’t keep track of it. it's, you know. Can we shoot? We’re shooting right now, isn’t this, this counts. We’ll get to the film, don't worry. We’ve got plenty of daylight. We're good. Why, are you not amused? I think it’s funny. This is too long to be your dick, right? Nah, mine’s longer. So, we’ve got Courtney here. She’s uh, holding my dick on that end. Smile, smile. Give a smile. You’re an actress, you can do a smile. Smile. Huh, yeah, there you go, there you go. Is it heavy? Not really. Whoa! Yo, don’t, don’t. This is plenty heavy, I mean, how, anyway. You don’t want it too heavy, or else it can’t get in, you know what I’m saying? Are you, are you going? Yeah.

Well yeah, but the woods are right there and we, it’s running out of the daylight, we, just go in the woods, it’s a lot quicker, the bathroom is, like, ten minutes that way. We’re in a park, here. Really? Yeah, just, no one’s gonna see you, I mean, I, I, I’ve done it, it’s, you know, go behind a tree, you pee, and then you’re done. It’s a lot quicker, it’s just, we have to get moving here, we don’t really have a lot of time. Just take like two minutes and then come back. We won’t look, we’ll just, we’ll be here, just, you know, hurry up. Yo, what are you doin’? This is her bag, bruh. Yo, why are you going through it? She went to pee. Look, I found a brush. We can, you wanna clone her? We can clone her. Ooh yeah. We'll have one for each of us? Yo, I’mma save it for later. What else is in there? We got, ooh, we got money! Ooh, how much? We got a rich one! Uh, let’s see. We got some dimes. I like the dimes. The dimes are small. You want the, I don't want a penny, - do you want a penny? - Nah, man. - You want a penny? - Who wants a penny? Don’t throw it at me! Dude, she’s taking a while over there too. Dude, look at that! Is that her pee? Yeah. I think it is. It goes all the way from here over to there. Do girls pee this much, dude? Like, Dude, I have no idea. Yeah, I don’t pee this much, damn, - what does she drink? - I have never seen this, dude. Get a shot, get a shot of like, dude, like, it’s like, saturated over here though. Like, that’s not just a little bit. Can we go? What are you drinking, dude? You said you were in a rush to film, why aren’t we filming? Well, because, I mean, we don’t really, we’re just looking at the pee, I don’t know, I mean, it’s funny. It’s like, behind the scenes stuff. I don’t want this on camera. Well, I mean, you did in the woods, - anybody can see it, I mean. - Mm. So, Courtney is a little bit thirsty, she says, uh, Yep. She wants a drink, um, and we found this tree here that she claims she can climb, so, uh, we made a deal that if you can climb this tree successfully, and, we’ll determine what’s successful, uh, then we will buy you a water. - Yeah. - Or, you know, maybe an iced tea or something, but, uh, Water’s good. Yeah. Get climbing! Okay. There she goes. Oh, there, oh! Skill, it looks like you’re gonna have to buy the water. Hang on, hang on. You never know. - I’m not actually buyin’ this girl a water. - This high enough? No, you gotta keep goin’. You have to go the top. Yeah. The top? Yeah. Uh. Definitely the top, keep going. It’s a tall tree. Yeah, well, that’s no excuse, you don’t get the water, you didn’t make it to the top. - Are you kidding? - She chickened out. I told you, you had to get to the top, does that look like the top, or does that look like the top? No. Yup. No water for you. Doesn’t look like the top to me, dude. You good? Can you help me? You can get down, you got up, don’t. There she is. Yay. Still thirsty? Yes. Yo! Squirrel! Wait, don’t scare it, don’t scare it. Leave it alone! Come here! That’s not nice! Where’s it goin’? Where’s it goin’? - If you’re cold, - Can we go inside soon? If you’re cold, the best thing to do is jumping jacks, you know? Yeah. Warms you right up. - Go for it. - Yep. Do some jumping jacks.

We’ll, we'll cast someone else! You messed a couple scenes, we gotta actually reshot the whole thing. Or reshoot. We gotta reshoot the whole thing. Yo, so, we found, we found Courtney’s vagina over here. Yo, look at this. It looks a little dry. - Yeah. - Ain’t lookin’ too good. We got, what is this? - Yo, what, what, what’s it doin’? - Who’s dick is that? Whose is that? You know, that ain’t long enough to be mine. It’s not mine either. Oh. Yeah, yup. She’s one of those. Damn. Yeah, she could use some, what is it, yogurt? - Mhm? - They use yogurt down there? I, I have no idea dude. Ain’t lookin’ too moist. Yeah. Yo, don’t be kickin' it my way. I don’t want that. I’m putting it in. It’s already in there, dudes. Tight as hell. It can go further. Hi, I am William, and I made 'Artifact of a Love'. So, Sai came to me, uh, with an idea for this big sort of massive sci-fi film that, um, just, budget-wise, uh, we couldn't really make. Uh, it was a little bit out of our hands, so we figured we'll take a piece of it from, from the end, and sort of just focus on that and make that into more of a short film, uh, which became 'Artfiact of a Love', and um, yeah, we're, we're, I mean, we're in love with it, we're, we, it's a really good film, um, we like it. Yeah, I've always been interested in making films and directing, uh, people, and, um, it's always been a passion of mine, it's always been a dream of mine, um, it's still a dream of mine to eventually be able to make bigger projects, maybe one day we can make something, uh, to the scale that Sai, um, you know, that his original idea was, um, so, hopefully we get there, but, I mean, even for right now, just to be able to make the films that we're making is, uh, it's an honor, it's a dream, um, since I was a kid I've always wanted to do this, and, here we are. I put out a casting call, um, to obviously cast people for the film, um, we got submissions from, you know, all over the country, and, um, Courtney was in New York City, and she had the best tape, um, so, she was clearly the choice for us, we knew, uh, the second that we saw the tape, and that she was so close, it would, it would be convenient, and we'd get a great performance from her and we did, she uh, knocked it outta the park. Courtney was, um, or is, a very talented actress, and, uh, just, as a person, she was great to have on set, and wonderful to work with, um, you know, I feel like its important as a director to, um, take care of your cast, and, your crew, and, whoever works on your films, and, to make them feel comfortable and appreciated, and, uh, Courtney felt very you know, um, respected, and, uh, very comfortable on set, um, that was very important for me, um, you know, being in control of everybody, making sure that the environment, uh, was one that you would like to work in, um, I think I accomplished that, and um, yeah, I mean, she did great, and uh, she is a very talented and great person. The film, to me, it deals very heavily with, um, themes that are important in my own life, um, there's, you know, love, there's, uh, death, there's, just, several aspects of this film that, uh, really came from my heart, um, they were very meaningful to me, and, and, I mean, I think that's what I do as a filmmaker, that's what all filmmakers do is they explore themes that are very personal to them, this was no exception, um, and, yeah, uh, it, it was sort of an opportunity for me to take moments from my own life that have been gnawing away at me, or, or whatever and just take my own experiences and pour them into a work of art that I can share with other people, and, um, that's one of the best parts of the whole process. Uh, my influences, um, the people that I look up to, uh, Stephen Spielberg, David Lynch, he's a great one, um, hopefully one day, um, you know, I can, make, a production to the scale of what they do, I think they do great work, um, they're huge inspirations to me, both, you know, directing, and, and just the stories that they tell, I hope to be able to, to tell one day, um, to the extent that they do, and to really be able to dive deep into, a, um, production like that without any limitations, uh, that's really what's best for this story, and I can't wait for the day that I'm actually able to accomplish that, it's gonna, it's gonna be fun. Hopefully, uh, in the future, um, we can make, uh, that sci-fi film that Sai brought to me, uh, it was about, like, 200 pages long, um, and it's really ambitious, uh, that's what I hope to be able to achieve, it was a really great story, and I hope that, that we can expand on it, and, just really kill it, um, even if it's, I mean, if, if, you know, maybe in the form of a comic book even, um, but, uh, I mean, first and foremost, I like telling stories, and I want to get that story out there, and I wanna get a bunch of other stories out there, um, and, so, that's, that's what I'm looking to do in the future, and, uh, I think it's gonna be really great, uh, I think people are really gonna like what I do next, what we do next, and um, I'm very excited. I can't wait. My advice for any aspiring filmmakers, anyone just starting out, um, first of all, you have to know what you want, that's, that's key, you have to have a goal in mind, and as long as you set your mind to that goal, you will be able to accomplish it, um, of course, to do that, you need people, you need a crew, you need a cast, and, so, always be respectful to people, and, and, be a guy that people would want to work with. Uh, you have to take your role seriously, and, if you, if you don't, then, nobody is gonna wanna work on your projects and nothing is going to get made because you can't do everything by yourself, so, um, I say have a goal in mind, set a date for yourself, I wanna have this made by this date, or, um, just, just know, you know, what you want to make, have a vision, and, go out and, and make that vision, and have a group of people that you can trust, and, and, that they can trust you is really important, and, just make cool things together. Hi, I'm Sai, and I made 'Artifact of Love' with William. I had this, um, crazy idea to do a sci-fi, um, like, it was, it was gonna be a whole three-part franchise and stuff, but, um, didn't have the money to make it, so, I, I pitched the idea to William, and like, you know, we decided to just take the last part, make a whole film out of that, and that's how 'Artifact of Love' came to be. So, I've known William since, you know, we were in elementary school, um, we basically grew up watching movies together, we'd go, um, almost every weekend to the cinemas, watch something or the other, um, and if we couldn't go out, we'd just be at home, um, you know on, on TV or whatever, um, yeah, so, you know, we, we have similar taste in movies, we always wanted to make movies together, and, I guess here we are, doing that now. Um, a little bit about William, he's, um, well, what can I say, he's literally among the best directors I know, um, he has such a keen eye for talent, um, like, I, I, I don't think anyone else does casting better than he does, he knows exactly who to work with, how to work with them, um, and even all the other technical stuff, you know, like, he, he even does the costumes himself, he even does the cinematography himself, you know, he's, he's all in, um, and that's just amazing about him, the eye that he has for perfection and detail, um, he, he genuinely knows, um, the entire craft of filmmaking, and he's really good at what he does. So, how we find Courtney, um, William put out a casting call, um, for the female lead for this film, um, and we got, we got a bunch of replies, um, from all over the country, and, uh, Courtney was by far, um, the best, um, audition that we saw, um, she nailed the character completely, her understanding of the depth of the character and like, you know, the layers that she brought out were just superb, um, yeah, and like, she was so professional, timely, um, always, always, um, a joy to work with, and, you know, I'm, I'm so glad that, you know, we were able to find her and work with her, because I don't think anyone else coulda done the character better than she did. Um, so, what does film mean to me, film is, um, you know, it's, it's, really touching to me and I feel very passionate about it, I think it's a great way to communicate with people, to share ideas, to, um, you know, express yourself and bring out who you really are, um, and share things with people that, you know, um, they need to know, that, you know, um, it's, it's a way to get out to people, it's also a way to just get entertained, you know, like, who doesn't like spending a Friday night at the cinemas, and just, you know, seeing a fun film, and, that's, that's sort of where I come, um, yeah, where, where I come from, um, yeah, I, I just, you know, film means to, film means the world to me, um, cause I think you can do a lot with it. The filmmakers, you know, that I've learned a lot from, and like, you know, I, I aspire to be like, um, you know, the, the main content that's really moved me, and like, you know, I, I aspire to be like that, you know, you have, the Christopher Nolan, you have Danny Boyle, you have Martin Scorsese, you know, these are the kind of filmmakers I want to be like, you know, I, I look up to them, and, I hope that one day I can make, um, you know, the sort of impact on cinema that they've had, um, and, you know, just, sort of, emulate their style, and, you know, their stature. So, I'm, I'm currently working on, um, a screenplay, it's, it's pretty long, um, yeah, I've, going, touching the two or three hour mark, um, and yeah, there, there's a few other, um, projects in the pipeline, a few of them, you know, waiting to be greenlit and stuff, and so, um, yeah, it's pretty exciting. Um, so, advice for aspiring filmmakers, um, well, you know, just, just be truthful, um, be who you are, make, um, films that mean a lot to you, um, and, you know, try and see if you can work with the best people, um, because they always bring the best to the table, um, and yeah, that, that's about it, just try and be yourself, express yourself, and, um, yeah, you'll get there. Hi, my name is Rachel Elstein, and I’m reading for the role of Angela Summering. Because you love yourself. You do. I always believed it. Even if you didn’t. Even when we were on the run. Avoiding the gangs. Avoiding my father. Even when you used to stay up all night saying you wanted to commit suicide for all the people you kill. And you’d drink. And you’d hit me. And I’d hit you. And you’d drink some more. And you’d go out and kill. Just so we could have money. Still do contract killing jobs, just for me. Freelance contract killing jobs, for me. For us. So, she, yeah, she wasn't right, uh, she was a little bit too fat, um, skin just wasn't really, uh, didn't have that actress look, um, didn't look the part at all, she's delivering the lines wrong, got the tone completely off, it's a dramatic role, a serious role, and she's just not getting into that headspace, and, uh, I could tell that there, there was, there was nothing you could do to fix this, uh, this was a lost cause right here, so, um, definitely not for this film, or most films, um, yeah, the she, this one missed the mark. Hi! My name is Gwen Gilbert, and I will be reading for the part of Angela Summering. Because you love yourself. You do. I always believed it. Even if you didn’t. Even when we were on the run and avoiding the gangs. Avoiding my father. Even when you used to stay up all night saying you wanted to commit suicide for all the people you’ve killed. And you’d drink, and then you’d hit me, and I’d hit you and then you’d drink some more. And then you’d go out and kill. Just so we could have money. Still do contract killing jobs, just for me. Freelance contract killing jobs, for me. For us. Thank you! So, uh, this one was great, um, woulda been awesome to have her in the film, problem was she was on the west coast, and just to get her out here would've been, um, it woulda cost money, and it, it woulda been inconvenient, and it just wouldn't work out, uh, which is really unfortunate cause she was really talented, and really hot, uh, it woulda been great to have her, um, hopefully in the future we can maybe fly her out, or figure out something, get an arrangement going to where we could work on her, uh, with her on something, because, yeah, she is, she's too hot, too hot to pass on, she is, uh, uh, easy on the eyes, which is what you want in an actress, and, she was also really talented, so, it was a shame it didn't work this time, but, uh, you know, who knows, hopefully in the future. Hi. I'm Cara McInnes, and I’m reading for the role of Angela Summering. Because you love yourself. You do! I always believed it. Even if you didn’t. Even when we were on the run, avoiding the gangs, avoiding my father. Even when you used to stay up all night saying that you wanted to commit suicide for all the people you’d killed. And you’d drink. And, you’d hit me. And I’d hit you. And you’d drink some more. And then you’d go out and kill. Just so we could have some money. Still do contract killing jobs, just for me.

This guy here, um, is a bozo, uh, decided, I, I don't know if he was trying to fuck with me, or if he's just clinically insane, uh, the casting call clearly said women only, actresses only, it is a female role, the name was female, the casting call said female, everything about it's female, this bozo applied anyway, again, I don't know why, if he's trying to just mess with me, but it's a waste of my time, uh, a waste of his time too, quite frankly, um, this one just pissed me off, he, just, yeah, ah, did, just, what a fuckin' bozo, he's a fuckin' bozo, this, this was, uh, this, this here was a shit show, I don't know what he was even, who he thought he was, but, he's, he's not a girl as far as I can tell, I don't know if I'm missin' somethin', but uh, yeah, he, he doesn't, he doesn't appear to, uh, be right in the head, so, something's goin' on here.

And then you’d go out and kill. Just so we could have money. Still do contract killing jobs, just for me. Freelance contract killing jobs, for me. For us. And here we have the real star of the show, Courtney Tane, um, everything about her is perfect, she has a perfect face, she has a perfect body, uh, she gave perfect delivery, she is everything that you want in an actress, um, wouldn't mind seein' her naked, her body is great, and, and she just looks perfect, and, um, it's very rare that you get that with a great delivery, sometimes you just can't find that, and you have to decide what you want to prioritize, but, she hit all the marks, um, definitely far above everybody else, uh, great voice as well, I could listen to her for hours, she is, uh, she was really great, she turned out to be really great, she is really great here, um, she definitely didn't disappoint, she, she's amazing. Hi William! Thanks so much for casting me, I’m super excited to get started on this project. Um, I don’t know how many of my clothes will work for the character, but, here are some options, as requested. Uh, I have this sweater. This blue romper. Flannels in different colors. Uh, some ripped skinny jeans. Black skinny jeans. And, for shoes I have these sneakers, and this pair of heeled boots. Let me know what you think! Hey! Here’s the outfit you chose. I like these clothes the best too. Hi William! I’m glad you like the outfit. Um, about the bra and the underwear, I don’t really think either would actually show at all underneath the outfit you chose, so, I actually don’t think we need to pick them out. Anyway, I’m looking forward to meeting you, and I can’t wait to get started on this project! Hi William, I’m really sorry. I totally understand what you mean about being a perfectionist and wanting to get this character down one hundred percent, even to every little thing she wears. I promise I’m not ‘unprofessional’ or ‘uptight’, I totally understand that this film means a lot to you. Here are some options. I have a black halter top bra. This nude bra. A burgundy one. And for underwear, I have this plaid pair, a red pair, and a black pair. Let me know which ones you'd like me to wear underneath the outfit, and I will do so. Looking for to meeting you and working with you! Hi William! This is the outfit, and I’m wearing the bra and underwear you chose underneath. I’m looking forward to meeting and working with you! So, this is the space, um, having a wrap party for the film, uh, Sai was not able to be here, his mom couldn't let him go or some shit, I don't know, um, and uh, Courtney, uh, cancelled a few days ago, so, um, she'll, have, I'll have a special guest coming in, in place of her, um, so just, you know, gonna carry on with things, got some, uh, some cool musical equipment here. Heh. Um, yeah, so, we got some cool artwork on the walls, um, yeah, it's a shame everybody couldn't come. No one is here but me. Um, we'll have, like I said, um, I'll, I'll have a guest coming, and, we'll just sort of, do our thing, but uh, yeah, everyone else is gone. No one else is here. At all. No one else is here. So, this is great. Um, non-refundable, this place, so I gotta, you know, do something, I don't have much of a choice, uh, that should up there have a DVD player, somewhere, I'll try to find that. Alrighty. Uh, so, just, say your name, if you could. Um, hi, I'm Myia. - You're, - Are you, are you William? - I am, yes, uh, yeah, it's, - Okay, hi. it's nice to meet you, um, I'm here for the wrap party. Yes, yes, of course, um, so just, come over here, you can join me in this little area, this can be our little home for the day, uh, it'll be just the two of us, cause, - nobody else could make it, so, - Oh, that's fine. it's uh, it's just us. Um, yeah, so, uh, up there, I, I gotta figure out how that thing works, but, we'll probably just get the film going up there, and just watch it together, and just - sort of have a good time. - Okay. Um, are you recording? Mhm. Yeah, I'm recording. Alright, um, so, the place said that it had a DVD player, so we could, you know, show the film, um, there's nothing up here, there's some random cables, but there's no box or anything, um, back here there's another TV, but still no DVD player, there's about twenty five fucking keyboards, and there's not one, uh, That's really frustrating, I'm sorry. Yeah, uh, do you, do you see one, am I missing it, or something? No, I don't think you're missing anything, I don't see a DVD player either. Mhm. Yeah, um, so, the, the, we're basically, um, screwed in that department, but whatever, it's fine, um, we'll just keep going, uh, I guess we will, um, maybe try to, we'll figure something out, I don't know, I really don't know, um, maybe watch it on my phone, or something, or, Yeah, I would love to! - Just sit on the couch together, - Mhm. and just sort of, watch it, watch it that way, that might literally be our only choice, uh, this was supposed to be a wrat, a wrap party! Wrap party! It was supposed to be - a wrap party, but no one's here, - I'm, There's no way to even watch the fuckin' film. Well, I'm here, and I can watch the film with you. Yeah. This thing is useless now, cause there's no DVD player, nobody came to the wrap party, do you want to, just, do, do you have your phone - or, or something - Mhm. Could we just, could we pull it up or something? Yeah, why don't we just watch it on my phone. Yeah, uh, I mean, I guess we have to, because no one's here and there's no DVD player and there's Well, the couch is great. Is it? Yeah? - It's a good couch? - Yeah. Good, you know, - I paid for the couch - I know. cause I paid for the space, and then no one came to the space because they said they were gonna, and then they didn't. Why don't you just sit down and relax? Uh, yeah, I don't, um, Can I start watching now? Yeah, yeah, yeah, press, uh, press play. So, tell everybody, uh, what you thought, what you thought of the film. Um, I really liked it. - Yeah? Did you? - Um, it was really interesting. Yeah, I mean, it, it was - a bit of a twist, right? - Mhm. It was, uh, eh, uh, - Yeah, I was not expecting that. - Probably, right, right, - well that's, that's the goal. - I was not expecting that at all. What about with, uh, with uh, uh, when, when, the, there's the gangster who's, uh, by the trees, and then, uh, we find out later that that gangster actually might have been the guy who killed me right, and then, that's, Yeah, he might have been the one who killed you. - Right. - Right. Yeah, it really worked for me. Cool, cool. Okay, um, so, uh, there's a little, uh, secret that I wanna go over, do you, do you mind, or, can I, about, can I tell them about you? - Oh, oh, yeah, whatever. - Okay, cool, uh, so Myia over here is actually an escort that I paid to be here because, uh, our actress Courtney said that she wasn't going to be able to make it here, just a few days ago, so, uh, fuck Courtney, um, Myia is a terrific person, and, um, better than Courtney, so, uh, thank you for being here, - Oh, thank you, that's so sweet. - And, Sai said that his mom isn't letting him come, and, uh, that's probably bullshit, he's just a pussy, but, um, Myia's here, which is super great, and uh, we just watched the film, you liked the film, right? I loved the film. She loved the film, right, she, - you even probably saw that, we, we got, - Mhm Got her reaction to that.
