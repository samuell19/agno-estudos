As long as I can remember... I long to go back to when the earth was green and full of life... and there was fresh water for everyone. In 2095 the Earth is contaminated with salt from the oceans that have grown. Animals and plants are extinct, whole continents have disappeared. Fresh water has become a luxury. But technology has been developed to travel through time. It requires a QEDA, an agent divided into two... and connected to itself through time and space. But the risk of change in their own time... It has been shown to be alarmingly high. Travel in time and the QEDA have been banned. We are waiting for Fang Rung. We go in together. - Fang Rung. - Ms. Minister. - Have you been informed? - Yes On behalf of the Minister of Defense, I welcome you to this briefing. We are joined today by Captain Fang Rung, Head of Scientific Security. In 2092, Corporal Gil Bingwen was sentenced to death for high treason. Today his appeal has been settled by the Supreme Court. With the votes five to two the Supreme Court has ruled to pardon Corporal Bigwen provided that he completed molecular reassembly. As long as Bingwen is a Quantum Entangled Divided Agent... a so-called QEDA, he must remain under house arrest. Fang Rung. You are the Head of Scientific Security now. What have you done to prevent any further security issues? As you and everyone else in here very well know... Our most important job has been to safely dismantle the travel program. We have now destroyed the last tests and neutralized the labs Our work has been carried out successfully in conjunction by the Dep. Of Cybersecurity... the operational branch of the military intelligence and Time Guard. In your assessment, what are the odds of other territories possessing time travel technology Just to establish a Bose-Einstein bridge requires the energy... equivalent to ten megaliters of fresh water, that is, ten million liters. And even if hypothetically another territory had a bridge... It would be worth nothing to them without a QEDA. So any risk of time change would there for be eliminated - Any further questions? - But it was all a show. There was already a new QEDA. Forgive me, Yin. I thought you knew what I was doing. The first thing I noticed was the smell. A fresh sweetness behind the salty sea. Spring, maybe. The year was 2017 and I had traveled to save the world. I knew I had to be careful. Do not change anything. Not be the cause of the least change. I tried to remember everything so I could tell you. One day. I passed through our city, Yin. Your city and mine. So familiar, and so different. When I went through the Ministry, I looked down from the office... and I imagined that I looked through time and found myself with my own self. And in a certain way I did it. I recognized your grandmother's grandmother immediately. She was the same as in the old photographs. I would find the NT11 protein and reverse the sequence. But I found the notebook. She had already written her last note. This krill converts salt water into fresh water... by storing sodium chloride crystals under the shell. Yes? Is not it true that krill lacks energy to complete the whole process? We work on the energy challenge. Over time, we will develop a krill... that can use UV energy in biological processes. I looked at Mona. I saw your mother in her. And I recognized your movements. She could not save herself, but her invention could save you. Sodium chloride in the oceans will soon be in very high concentrations. It will affect all life on earth. The change will be so fast that only some species will survive. Some fish could survive, some jellyfish, krill, algae... and some birds. Flamingos Those who can drink water with lots of salt, if we are lucky. Actually, they should enjoy life as much as they can... because in about ten years there will not be much to laugh about. In two days your flight would fall into the sea... and her investigation would die with her. But, of course, it was a mistake to contact her. - Mona Lindkvist? - Yes Good day. My name is Gordon Thomas and I want to ask about the Superkrill and NT11. I saw you in the auditorium. Are not you from the university? No, I'm a science journalist. I read about you in Science Weekly. - Then someone read that article. - It was not that exhaustive. No, it would be bold to say so. You can have an interview tomorrow. I'm just in Copenhagen today. I live in Seattle. Did you come from Seattle to hear about the Superkrill? - What magazines do you write for? - A university newspaper. - Have children? - Yes I have a daughter. My Louise is terrified of the future. I have told him stories of terror about the destruction of the earth. Should not you tell children the truth, even if it is cruel? Nobody knows anything about the future. It is true, and at the same time no. There are many things we can discover. In 60 years, only 40 percent of the world's people will survive. At that time large parts like Japan,... Russia, Central America and Europe will be under water. Where there is no water, there will be desert. The last of the groundwater will be contaminated with salt. The people who did not die, will live with wars and cannibalism. - Does the process work? - Yes, but he's not ready yet. Now I work more from home. The institute abandoned my investigation. I'm going to Toronto to get sponsors. Therefore, the samples must be in Gothersgade, in our department. We will be heard. I would enter my own home. I had started to go on my own steps. (Watch out) with the dog I allowed myself to look out the window for a moment. The view from your room, as it looked a long time ago. I was two bodies with a conscience. Sitting in my office receiving the sequence for the NT11. At the same time, sitting in the apartment and reading that, 80 years earlier. It was like sharing a thought. - Sir, the prognosis of Time Guard. - Tonight I would like to have a new one. You were successful, did you receive it? The other sent the sequence twice. They were identical. I hope you are good. The NT11 may be good. - Mrs. - Yes? - I'm going to the lab. - Okay, thanks. Officially, it is SCI SEC who executes the security control. How is Yin? She is conscious, but not like to assimilate the food. Elena, the one in her class, also died. I have not told Yin. We are ready? Come on. Dad? Ivan was here today. Ivan is a good boy. He wants to be an investigator, like mom. He will be a good scientist. - Will you also become a researcher? - If I live. Obviously you will. I would love to become QEDA as Agent Bingwen. Where did you get that idea? I can imagine being double and traveling in time. A QEDA is not double. A QEDA is half. If you can travel in time, you can also change things. We who are here today are here because of what has happened. What happens if you do not want to change anything? If you just want to sit down and watch what it was like. A dog. Should I tell the Minister? "My daughter wants a bridge of time,... so I can travel back in time and see a dog. " Maybe you can not be a QEDA when you have salt poisoning. Take, honey. Drink a little water Carefully. In a few hours we should open the bridge of time. I was on my way home. Then the rain came. It was a different rain. Quiet and silent. It was fresh water falling from the sky. I thought if you would ever experience such a rain. For a while I forgot to leave. Come here, Baby! - Sorry. - Gordon? - You were not leaving? - Yes, but my flight was canceled. How annoying. She is my daughter, Louise. - Hello. - We are living here. - AHA. - Can I have an orange, mom? Do not get away, Baby. The last thing I felt was the raindrops on my face... and the smell of an orange. I lost something at that time. But I still did not understand what it was. I received the sequence. Neli is watching her and will return her soon. - Good job, Rung. - Thank you. - Anything else? - Do not. - But...? - One thing. We had to contact Mona Lindkvist. - She should not be contacted. - We needed to get the sequence. - I hope you have him. - I have it. But I did not have it. I would not calm down until I return... and once again he joins me to be one person. As we get closer to the coordinates... a strange feeling of abandonment grew in me. We open the bridge of time as agreed. He has eight minutes left. Its time. We have two attempts left before the battery runs out. You want to try one more time? Did he say anything? Rung? He did not come? No. - How is the fresh water? - All the pools are full. If there are no side effects, we publish the sequence next week. - What does it mean that he did not come? - Yin eaten? - What is the error at the origin? - I do not know! I have lost contact with him. We are working on that. Your mother had the right to be angry. We were so close to the goal, and then I lost control. It seems to be successful. Soon we can take it to the big pools. - Did you increase the Time Guards measurement? - It's a little more than normal. - How much? - Very little. If I no longer have contact with myself... does it mean that I am no longer a human being? Do I have to be considered two people? Do you think, Yin, that it is possible to abandon oneself? AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT COSTS 118 LIVES NOW SHE DOES NOT HAVE ANYONE Here, have some. May 19. Two days before Mona happened. I was looking for something. One or several... signs of change. I began to fear for my own actions. May 18, 2017 I know it works. - Can he be dead? - No, I would be dead too. - Unconscious? - Maybe. I'll talk to Agent Bingwen. Let's go through the market first. Good day. Come and look. - How much? - Are good. They are yours for a good price. Around 100 liters the pair. They deliver it in the south warehouse. It's almost a scam. In a week a liter each time is worth less. In a week, yes. Today is today. Water please. I beg you. Look, we have a guest. Fang Rung. Come here, Captain. - Bingwen. - Sorry, I drank today's water ration. - Did you give up the violin? - You know what Rumi wrote. There are hundreds of ways to thank God. Did you heard the news? - We have our death sentence. - You mean your pardon? - I came to congratulate you on that. - How inappropriate. Its not at all like you, courteous self Captain. - I brought a present for both of you. - Both of us? We are one. Haven't you heard? Soon you will see it too. Beats being executed, right? We have not seen you in six months, and you come in here waltzing in like a suiter. - Bringing shoes. - Unused. They can't have been cheap. This is not a ball. And we're not getting married. So, why are you here? I have some questions, regarding your communications. - Before your reestablisment... - As they so elegantly put it. I want to know more a bit more about how you communicated when you went traveling. - It was flawless, wouldn't you say? - Absolutely. I spoke with you and you heard my thoughts, word for word. Did you ever lost contact? Never? - Never. - Never. Is it possible to shutdown? To sever the connection so you can not hear the other? You can, but why would you? The entanglement it serves as a lifeline. - I was his lifeline. - He was my lifeline. So you see no wonder no one clings to one's better half. Thank you. Of course, the other's voice grows fainter. The entanglement wears thin. Like a thin, thin thread. Like a teeny tiny bell dangling at the end of it. I told you, Fang Rung, time is distance. The further back you travel, the greater the distance becomes. Yesterday will be last year. For each breath in the other time the distance becomes alll the more real. I'm not saying you forget the other but ... The new reality is strong and full of colors. The old is like a dusty book with black and white illustrations. I think I got the whole thing wrong, but I thought that the Security Council hired him... to dismantle our wonderful adventures in time? And now he likes a piece of advice? - What? - I think you're right. He says that there is a new QEDA. He says he thinks it's you. So Captain. Did you plan to go awry? A storm is coming, sir. I could not feel it, but maybe he could feel me. I sat by your bed and tried to make him remember you. Your smile, your courage, your dreams. Dad? I dreamed of a dog. I have also dreamed of a dog. According to mom, it's only a matter of time before we can recreate our whole lives. Then you do not want to start with the dogs. Do you remember when you did this? Anyway, maybe one day we can recreate a dog. May 18, 2017 I know it works. May 19. Will he be a Buddhist? Also, why is this happening now? Soon you should be able to measure the changes in Time Guard. I did not know if he was my friend or my enemy. Oh, there you are. Thanks for not coming together. It would look bad. No thanks. He has not come home. - Why not? - I dont know. There may be something wrong with the connection. I no longer have a connection. I thought you had everything under control. - I want to travel to go for it. - Does not matter. Let me catch him. I know I can do it. With both, you and he in the past, it will be impossible for us to reach you. The Minister was right. I must put an end to it. You should live, but without me. I'm sorry, Rung. We had an agreement. You're right. We continue with the plan. Your sacrifice has not been in vain. I would die to stop it. But I was not ready to die in vain. Fang Rung. Back so soon? I hope you didn't fall in love. It would be complicated... a ménage à trois. Or should I say... quatre? - Thanks for the shoes, Fang Rung. - Yes, thanks for the nice shoes. - We started using them. - While we can. So the other one has not come back yet now? Looks like the world will never be the same So the great Fang Rung has flaws, after all. Pride comes before the fall. I say he took a one-way ticket. A trip to wonderland. "Follow the white rabbit." But who is the queen? And who gets thier head chopped off? I am sorry. How do you feel? Comme ci, comme ça. Maybe it's a blessing. Maybe they'll set me free now? You think so, Fang Rung? I told him he was too negative. I would have liked it to travel. All of the adventures he only got to experience second-hand. He was not unlike yourself, Captain. Or the part of you I'm talking to. He too was also afraid of the present. We were so afraid of being one again. Captain... We have to contact the Minister and tell her that it did not work. Have you heard? Time Guard found detours of cas 3 per thousand. The Minister called a press conference in half an hour. The world is sinking. They are here to kill you. I will stall the Minister. I will tell her you're dead. Good evening sir. I would love to be alone with Yin. - Dad? - Yes Is something happening? Just sleep. Yin? When you get off, use the last energy to enable the bridge. Look here every half hour. You will know what I mean when you see it. Tell them if they do not do as you say... Fang Rung puts the world upside down. Here. Stop here. I remembered that all this was not there. The trees were not there. Cars, houses. The people. Nothing existed. The bank I was in did not exist. The man... - The birds... Doves, I think. - Come closer. They were gone a long time ago. Do you want some? Here you have. It's fresh Yes Yes Yes... It was scary, Yin. I was there with your great-grandmother, so indifferent and carefree. I did not recognize myself. It was like seeing a stranger. Goodbye. C'mon darling. You came. This is strange. We have the sequence to work. Neli has done it. I came here to pick you up. - You look tired. - What happened? - Why you did not come? - Taking. Drink a coffee. They drink it all the time. - Why did not you communicate? - One cup requires 40 liters of pure water. Answer back! Why did not you communicate? I could not. - You think I'm a traitor. - What do you think? I know, but it seems like a betrayal... be here and not look at the flowers. To not enjoy the fresh air. I could not leave here. - We have to go now. - Mona is coming. I've only invited her to lunch. - She's your lover? - What do you think? - When is the bridge opened? - As soon as possible. I'll send a message to Neli through Mona's notebook. Are you in the apartment? I think so, if she is not using it. Everything is crazy, QEDA. The whole world is upside down. Chestnuts. Do you remember the last chestnut tree in Copenhagen? It moved with the air, and we were 7-8 years old. Huge roots and millions of liters of water to try to save it. Do you know where I was yesterday? In the zoo. I saw tigers, elephants, polar bears. I can not explain it. We can go there now. I can show you giraffes, monkeys. We can recover the notebook later. We do not have time. They have already measured a change of three per thousand. Our presence here has begun to influence history. - What did you say to Mona? - Nothing. I said my flight was canceled and then she let me stay for the night. But she has said a lot about her parents during her investigation. I said I was a journalist. It will be a personality interview. Or a love story. We can stay here and also save it. - Do you go to the zoo every day? - No. Help her with the investigation before everything goes to hell. Tomorrow we will be human again. I'm afraid I can not. You are Fang Rung! I never felt so alone before. - Take me Home. - I'll take you home. - But I do not trust you. - No. You should not trust me. I'll find the notebook and write Neli. I'll pick you up tomorrow when Mona's gone. I want to make sure she takes her flight. I am sorry. I'm so sorry I did not go. - What happened? - I hit myself. What did you hit? Did you go through a door or what? I was attacked by two young people in the park. - It's completely crazy. - Yes And I was very angry with you. I'm sorry, it happens. - Do you need something cold? - No, no problem. Are you sure? - Can I use the bathroom? - Yes - Take this. It's cold - Thanks. It is the best medicine. - Louise? - Hello. What are you doing here? Are you not sleeping at Sarah's? Yes, but I wanted to be with you, now that you're leaving. - They will not have fought? - Mom, I'll go there when you're gone. I knew that Louise should have slept at a friend's when the plane fell. There was a slight change, but it was still a change. Today Gordon will stay here again. He has been attacked. - Where? - In the park. - I was just there. - Yes, but you had Baby with you. - You're always kidding. - Louise... Louise? She gets mad at anything. I will order Thai food. You like? - This is not so strong. - Thank you. - Did you not live in China? - Yes You speak Chinese? - What does it mean? - "Of course I speak Chinese." We could have laughed at that, Yin. You and me. That he was sitting there talking to two people who no longer existed. I need some quotes from your notes for the article. My notebook is very private. I thought you could give me some relevant notes. Maybe, I'll see it. - Good evening, old lady. Sleep well - You too. I will not be here tomorrow when you get up. I'm leaving at seven. Remember the keys, the cell phone, and feed Baby. - And remember that I love you. - Goodnight. - Good evening, Gordon. - Good evening, Louise. Good night baby. Maybe I should forget about this. What should I do in Toronto? - Because what you say? - Why is it so complicated. Toronto is far away, and I am so distant with Louise. I could teach from 10 to 14 and then be with Louise. But what you do is important, Mona, and nobody else does. Yes, but neither can anyone else be Louise's mother. How can I explain something I do not understand? Ask me if it was better to save the world before disasters. That for a moment I was tempted to sacrifice myself for them. If you could do it, would you change the past? Purely hypothetical. No I would not. What if you could solve the climate disaster, for example? If I could travel and change everything, everything would not make sense. - Nothing would make any sense. - No. That is what separates us from animals, that we can make conscious decisions. And you have to make decisions. Of course I'm going to Toronto. I have to do it. I understood what must have happened to my other half. This world had taken root in me. Maybe it was the same time. This past, with its colors... and its smells. Dad? My love. EVERYTHING IS FINE. OPEN THE BRIDGE AT 12. I wanted to tell Mona that her invention would save you... and many others. But, of course, I did not. Parents meeting! May 24, hour? I hate the goodbyes. Thanks for now M. I was thinking about Louise. How she would wake up to another reality. A future without your mother. - Hello. - I did not know there was someone here. - Gordon, I'm Mona's friend. - Sarah from the floor below. I will adopt Baby while Louise is in Toronto. While Mona is in Toronto. - Louise went with her. - It can not be right. I spoke with her this morning. I'm going to feed the fish on Sunday. She took Louise. I knew that we existed. We exist because everything happened as it should have happened. Forgive me, Yin. I thought I knew what I was doing. There's nothing to swim for. Nobody to go back home to. Everything I loved is gone. My name was Fang Rung. I've ruined the weather, and it's raining. I think I'll stay for a while.
