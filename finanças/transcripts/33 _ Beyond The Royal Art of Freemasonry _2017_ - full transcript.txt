(Tricoast Worldwide tone) (slow tempo melancholy music) (mid tempo piano) - I became a Freemason because I was obsessed with understanding what death was at a very young age. I was born in Spain. My mother worked for the government and my father was in the Air Force. It was pretty soon when we moved to New York that my parents got divorced, and then my mother remarried to my step-father. As I grew up my step-dad became the prominent figure in my life. He was my hockey coach, I played ice hockey for 13 years. On December 26th, 1991, I was 14 years old. It was the night after Christmas and my step-father died of a heart attack. After my dad has died, I really was looking for an answer for why this happens. It sent me on this journey to understand what this was, why it happens, and then what happens after you die, is there something, is there not something? Part of what this story's about is the quest of going as deep as you can into the unknown. - So as the story starts, we have some very peculiar questions. The fundamental message of masonry is truly man's pursuit of communion with his creator. And masonry is a very unique and ancient age old repository of wisdom and knowledge that has been preserved through the ages and gives a whole new perspective to the man looking to understand who he is, where he has come from, what he is to be doing, and his ultimate direction. Masonry provides all of the tools for a man to think about that, and to come to grips with who he really is. If you can think, you're probably a good prospect for masonry. If you can't think, it's probably better to follow the 10 steps to salivation that most folks ascribe to. Masonry is not for those folks. - Freemasonry has been a part of my life since the day I was born. Generations of my family have been masons. It's not been continuous. If memory serves, we can count back to a seventh generation Freemason. My father's a Freemason, my grandfather's a Freemason, my great grandfather was a Freemason. I don't think I really understood it until I was much older in life. Frankly, I'm not even sure that I fully understand it now. I think that's one of the beauties of Freemasonry is that it's not something you're going to necessarily be taught in a day. It's a lifelong commitment and a journey. Frankly, there are some men who enter Freemasonry and don't continue. There were thoughts that I would be one of those men because I joined Freemasonry at a relatively young age and didn't come back for five years, until I met some guys from a lodge where I'm a Past Master of now, and I just, as soon as I met these guys, I'm like these are the dudes that I want to hang out with, and that was it, that was really a turning point and after five years from becoming an Entered Apprentice I said duh, it's time to continue. From that point forward for seven, eight years, I was there every week. - Freemasonry of course is traditionally thought of as the world's oldest and largest fraternity for men. A true statement, it is a fraternity, it has always been a fraternity. It has been an organization that promotes the interests of men, or at least traditionally. That was its purpose. There's a lot of theories of origin about the fraternity, and it in fact has been around for so many years we're not real sure where we came from, but the most popular theory of origin and the theory that is supported by most Masonic scholarship today is that we evolved from the builder's guilds, the operative Freemasons of the Middle Ages. - It's a means by which men can coordinate with men, can have fellowship with them, but it's really much much more than that. It's a means by which you discover your own identity. It's a process in which you learn who you are and gain some idea of what you're supposed to be doing in the universe. - Freemasonry is not a secret organization, but it is an organization that has certain modes of recognition, ways in which masons make themselves known to one another that we keep confidential. Indeed, the whole ceremony of receiving that and being exposed to the basic principles of Freemasonry we also keep confidential. We keep these things confidential because they heighten the experience of becoming a mason. They are essentially based on the working tools and technics of the operative masons. Freemasonry is not really an intellectual exercise as much as it is an emotional, spiritual and experiential exercise. - I ended up moving to London for a short period of time. I studied abroad there. One day, I got a little too drunk and I ended up getting lost and just wondering around London and I ended up on Great Queen Street and I saw this building when I turned around. I'd never really seen a building that looked like that, it was very very unique. I remember above the doors of the building, high above the doors there were these two symbols and they were the symbols of the square and compass, the symbols of the Freemasons. I would try to find anything that I could about what the building was and then I found out okay, it's for this group called the Freemasons and then I started reading different authors Masonic authors like Mackey, and Albert Pike, and different scholars and essays, anything I could find. The more I read about masonry, the more interested I became in it because not only did it have the same types of principles and philosophies that I was already interested in, but some of the men that had passed through masonry's doors were pretty big idols of mine like Mozart, Voltaire, and Benjamin Franklin, George Washington. Some of the greatest minds from human history had been a part of this. I thought to myself, there has to be something to this if all of these geniuses, if all of these great men have been a part of this, this society, there's definitely something to it. What really resonated with me is that Freemasonry believes that all men are created equal. - In masonry, one of the important parts of the mythos is the widow's son, and it so turns out that I actually am indeed a widow's son, my father passed when I was young. I was at my mom's house going through just a bunch of junk she had and I found this mug, and this mug was full of pencils and it had the double headed eagle on it and it said Scottish Rite Spring Formal and through my studies, I recognized that as a Masonic sign. It didn't say masonry, it didn't have a square and compass, but I knew that the Scottish Rite was one of the branches of masonry and I was like whoa, this is really cool. I went to my mother and I asked her, "Mom, why do you have this mug? "Where did you get this from?" and she said, "Oh, that was one of your dad's mason cups." I go, "What are you talking about?" She goes, "Your dad was a mason and we "went to this spring formal for the Scottish Rite, "and they gave that to us." And I was just blown away. It's like something had led me to that moment to affirm what I'd always felt inside. It felt like a whole world opened up to me then because I was still one of the uninitiated. I was one that still thought you had to be part of a bloodline or part of a legacy per se to become a mason and I had tingles all over myself because I felt like oh wow, I actually qualify to belong to this secret order, this mysterious group, this is part of me. That only inspired me to do more research, to actually start looking into lodges in my hometown of Boston, Texas. - Primarily I was intrigued because of the overlap between Freemasonry, other secret societies, and ancient mystery cults. My big thing was ancient Egypt so that led to my study of the phenomenon of mystery cults and secret societies and their inspiration from Greek and Roman and also Egyptian style secret societies. - In Jamaica's a little bit interesting because I grew up in a community called Oxford Spring and within the community's little bit rural and so a lot of the folks are not aware of Freemasonry as it were, but, they would see rituals being done, especially at funerals and they wonder what this is, and so a lot of folks would recognize this as oh, the blackheart man, because they were all dressed in black and white. I started understanding that masonry was really nothing more than a brotherhood, but at the time because they were referring to these men as the blackheart men, you thought these men were dangerous men, men who were diabolic in their nature and who wanted to really dominant, take over, and control everything, but that was not really the case. Good thing is I grew with a man who understood the nature of what masonry's all about and they exhibit those type of attributes and I was one of those persons who learned from him, understood many things where masonry was concerned, but he still did not tell me the whole spectrum so I became interested in learning about it myself. - If you don't know a mason and you want to become a mason, it's a simple search of the internet. You can find a local lodge. - Most guys petition the lodge because there's something inside them, whether it was stimulated by their dad, or by their grandfather, or by their neighbor, or their great uncle Joe, it's immaterial. The fact of the matter is is that most guys are stimulated to seek the lodge and knock upon its door because there is a yearning within them. Now they may not cognitively recognize this, it may not be in their conscious awareness, but they know, they have a feeling, there's a drive that pushes them toward the door of the lodge. - Once you have gone through the process of getting to know a lodge, you are then essentially given a application if you so request, and you fill out the application, you let them know that you're not an atheist or a felon essentially, that you are of legal age, and once the application is put in, it's voted on in lodge. - There has to be a unanimous vote in the lodge, that way no one is coming in that someone might have an issue with. They might look at another lodge. We want our guys who are interested to really meet the brothers of the lodge. We think it's gonna create a longer lasting connection because you have just a better understanding of who everybody is and if you're gonna jive with them. - To become a mason you must believe in a supreme being, however you might define that, and you must also believe in a future existence. Again, however you might define that. - Freemasons believe that there is an inherent need in men, to be initiated into manhood. There needs to be a set of moral and ethical guidelines that teach a man what the journey of mature masculinity is. To take a young man from sort of the impetuosity of youth to the mature masculine soul. - Joesph Campbell among others talks about the enormous importance of initiation. He talks about the fact that for women, it's not necessary because nature tells a woman unmistakably when she is no longer a girl, when she is a woman, it's dramatic, it's powerful, it's inescapable. Men don't become fully autonomous adult males without some form of initiation. For many it's the military or some other organization like that but if you go way back in history, in every society which we have record, there's been a necessary moment, a necessary point in which the man goes through a ceremony, a ritual, an understanding which divides his life and he talks about things which happen before and things which happened after. (dramatic piano music) (dramatic piano music) (flick) - Even a little bit of light can dispel much darkness. Brethren. The soul passes to a point in the Masonic journey when our minds were first about to behold the light of Freemasonry, before the light, there was a sound that commanded. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, and the earth was void and without thorn, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And God said, "Let there be light." Think about it. We're talking big bang. (dramatic explosion) Creation, the beginning of becoming a Freemason. The first injunction upon all creation and upon us as newly initiated masons let there be light. Brethren, I submit to you that these words are the purpose of life and the foundation of all that we were meant to do as men and as masons. - The Blue Lodge is considered your first experience in Freemasonry and that consists of three degrees, the Entered Apprentice Degree, which is the First Degree, the Fellow Craft Degree, which is the Second Degree, and the Master Mason Degree which is the Third Degree. Once you have completed those three degrees, you are considered a Master Mason. - Still to this day the First Degree of Masonry, the Entered Apprentice is one of the most beautiful things I've ever experienced in my life. It feels like almost like you're a new planet being born, but you're in a state of darkness, like you're revolving in this orbit, because you're literally traveling in the lodge in an orbital fashion, you're not going in a specific square pattern, or you're not going in a triangle, you're like orbiting. It felt like, like I was, like I had been born into this new life and I knew everything from my life up to that point but I couldn't see and I was in this whole other realm. - It is meant to be profound and transformative. It is definitely a basic understanding of the principles of Freemasonry. I think in terms of being the candidate, it might be overwhelming because it may be your first experience with that type of activity, but it is definitely meant to be an eye opening experience. - When I was about to do my First Degree, I really didn't know what to expect. It was a transition of rebirth basically. It was something that was a new and unique part of my life at that point. It was various stimuli coming at me and I was traveling in an orbital fashion, like a planet would, not knowing what to expect but just trying to take it all in, and it was actually a very sort of exciting moment for me that I knew something different was going to happen in my life after that. - After you get your First Degree, you're told in order to progress you have to memorize a portion of the ceremonies that you just went through. You're given that information in the form of what's called a Blue Book, it's your cipher book. The cipher isn't written in English, it's literally a code, and you memorize this and it's basically like a test where when you go back into the lodge room to give your proficiency, it's called meaning that you're proficient in understanding the Degree that you just went through. For some people it takes them, it could take a month, for some people it could take years. It's just dependent upon the person's schedule, their work, how much time they put into learning it. It's not easy. But it also improves the mind, the way the mind begins to think. You memorize your cipher for your First Degree, you go back to lodge, you recapitulate that for your proficiency and then you're scheduled for your Second Degree which is the Fellow Craft Degree. - The Second Degree is kind of looked at as emblematic of period of growth in your life, and there's a big focus on learning and improving the mind by studying. Looking at things like arithmetic, or geometry, astronomy, music, grammar, logic, rhetoric. These are concepts and areas of study that really help make people more well rounded. - A lot of the rituals and ceremonies in Freemasonry take place around King Solomon's Temple. - King Solomon's Temple is the grand metaphor that unites all of us, and sort of represents the journey we're going through in the Three Degrees. The First Degree being sort of the porch of the temple, the Second Degree being the middle chamber, and then the Third Degree being the inner chamber, you know, the holy of holys, the secrets of secrets to be had at the end of the journey. - One of the most beautiful aspects of the Fellow Craft Degree is what's called the Winding Staircase Lecture and it talks about how these different sets of stairs going up this winding staircase instruct on different things like beauty, strength, and wisdom, and the five senses and the seven liberal arts and sciences, and the main focus that comes to the forefront of the Second Degree is the study of geometry. - Freemasonry, of course, is based on geometry and we refer to it as the symbol of the harmony of the universe. So if the harmony of the universe is the work of the divine, which we could refer to as the logos, in geometry is the symbol of that work, then on the principle of hypostasis, geometry is the symbol of the supreme being. - Looking at the celestial gallery, you can see that there's the hand of the great architect in the sky. I think about the heavens, I think about the celestial globe, I think about the constellations, and I kind of think about this larger body of patterns, beautiful geometric patterns in the sky, sort of reflecting as above so below. - So you complete the Fellow Craft Degree and similar to the First Degree you then have to memorize a portion of the lecture of the Degree, and then at that point you're ready to be raised to Master Mason. - So after the Second Degree you have the Third Degree, and that's what I say is when a mason becomes a made man within the fraternity. It is the ultimate transformative experience. It is the end of the journey as far as Blue Lodge Masonry becomes, and it is when, after you have persevered through the Degree, you have all the rights and benefits possible to you as a mason in the fraternity. - The Third Degree is it's one of my favorite Degrees. It is kind of emblematic of the twilight years in life and I think it it encourages the initiate to be comfortable with the fact that this place, the time we have here, is not infinite. That we are not immortal. Even though that's kind of a given, when you really think about it, it can be earth shattering when you really sit and contemplate your mortality. I mean there can be no more profound an experience in my mind than really understanding and coming to grips with the fact that someday you will die. - The main lesson of the Master Mason Degree is that all of life is a preparation for death and so how are you gonna live your life in the time that you're here? - Of course, everything is entirely energy. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, so almost by definition, because we are energy, there is going to be some part of us that's going to exist beyond our death. - We're all ultimately trying to connect with the part of ourself that doesn't die. We're all ultimately trying to purify ourselves and trying to deal with destruction and renewal. We are copying the book of nature and the book of nature, every year, she dies and she is reborn because that's what happens. Winter time, spring, summer, fall goes in seasons. We go in seasons, so our Degrees go in seasons, our lives go in seasons. - Elements of those Degrees that I went through, come up throughout the day in my life. I'm always noticing things that relate to masonry and it's a way of living my life, it's a code of ethics and other masons live by those same codes. I can meet a mason anywhere in the world and we might not have a lot in common, but I know that I can go with that person and trust them to be living the same code of ethics that I am myself, and there's a certain unity there. - So the options for a candidate, once they have attained the Third Degree, are a few different things. They can stay right where they're at in their understanding of what they've just experienced and try to figure it out, they can obviously join the line and participate in the Blue Lodge, they can also pursue the York Rite and the Scottish Rite Degrees, both of which elaborate on what was taught to them in the Blue Lodge and really expand upon it in a much larger format. (Scottish bagpipes play) (Scottish bagpipes play) (Scottish bagpipes play) - In Scottish Rite Masonry you have two main jurisdictions, you've got the Northern jurisdiction and the Southern jurisdiction. The Northern jurisdiction is relatively small encompassing a degree of the Northeast of the United States and I think parts of the Northern Midwest. Then the Southern jurisdiction encompasses everything else worldwide, it's a much bigger organization. Within the Southern jurisdiction you have different valleys. So you would have for instance, in Tennessee, we would have the Valley of Knoxville, the Valley of Chattanooga, the Valley of Nashville, and the Valley of Memphis, and such is the case with all the different states, and all the different regions of the Scottish Rite worldwide. Within the different valleys, we have four different bodies that encompass different parts of the Degrees, different groups of the Degrees, ending finally with the Consistory which would be the 32nd Degree. - The Supreme council rules the entire jurisdiction, the Southern jurisdiction and as you know there's a Northern jurisdiction as well, considerably smaller than the Southern jurisdiction. - The Supreme Council's main focus is to add a bit of unity to what would otherwise be a very very large and heavy organization. - The typical Scottish Rite Valley is comprised of the Lodge of Perfection, the Chapter of Rose Croix, the Council of Kadosh, and the Consistory. We go through each of the Degrees that comprise each of those individual bodies. It's absolutely essential that a Master Mason going through the Scottish Rite achieve at least the minimum of the 14th Degree, which allows him then to sit in the stated meetings where business is conducted. So that becomes an essential part of the Scottish Rite training, and then obviously you want to move beyond that and achieve the 32nd Degree, and I suppose if you're a really lucky guy, you'll get the 33rd. - I would describe the Scottish Rite as a modern day mystery school. The way that I like to think about it is really, it involves a lot of training in the virtues, it involves a lot of training in personal improvement, personal transformation, personal purifications that are necessary so that the parts of the self, which are not working, which are dysfunctional, they're symbolized by different characters in these dramas, that they can be cast off and that the true self can emerge. - The fraternity is basically the source of male initiation. The Scottish Rite on the other hand takes that to the next level. It goes way past initiation, it assumes that's already taken place, and now it goes into learning and development. What kind of human being are you gonna be? What is your value system going to be? How are you going to understand what's important? And how are you going to understand your relationship to the universe? Your relationship to deity? These are all issues that the Scottish Rite deals with and I think deals very effectively. That's actually the task of the first body. First is called the Lodge of Perfection. On a mundane level it pays the bills, it's the organizational body of the Rite, but it's quest themed, the thing it teaches, the thing it does is to find this original source of who you are, and it uses the same kind of thing you're gonna find in the ancient Greek traditions, you'll find it in Maslow, you'll find it in basic psychology, find it in Freud, this idea of making the journey inside and down, and into the deepest level of your ego where you discover the cubical stone in the Scottish Rite, you'll discover the material world with the symbol of deity, the triangle insured into it. It tells you something about what you are as both a divine and a mundane creature. - This concept of perfection is very similar to, connected to in alchemy the process of transmutation, the process of raising the stone. This whole thing is about the first temple and the concept that's really powerful to me is secrecy and silence, fidelity, and obedience, those concepts, they're necessary in order to go into the mystery school, and it takes a lot of studying, a lot of scratching under the surface to understand what it is that you've just been through, what it is that you've just seen. They have a sign of silence, they have a sign of secrecy, it's like you're entering into this thing and you can't really shout it from the rooftops. Even if you tried to reveal it, it would be impossible, to me that's the symbolism of the secrecy in the Fourth Degree. - Secrecy and silence are so important because people need to learn how to keep their mouths shut, and that is a thing which we have lost. How can you trust a man if you tell him what's really important to you because you need to get it dealt with, you need to get it out, and he goes and tells everybody what you said? How can you possibly ever trust him again with anything? Why would you? We live in this very strange world in which we have decided that secrecy is somehow a bad thing. I'm forced to disagree, I think secrecy is a very good thing, a very positive thing. It could be used for bad purposes, there's no question about that, certainly. But you know, I have a feeling when they were working out the D-Day invasion, they didn't really want the enemy to know the plans. (bombs exploding) There are things it's useful just to keep quiet about. One of the things that just absolutely fascinates me, because I do not understand it, is this Facebook phenomena where everybody is busy telling everybody else everything about them. I can not imagine that I have any friends who are fascinated in knowing what I had for lunch. - The Lodge of Perfection is dealing with the initial Degrees that take you all the way through essentially the same story as the first Three Degrees, but with considerably more detail. There are little side vignettes to explain some of the happenings that occur in the first Three Degrees, so we're really talking about the Hiramic legend and how that pertains to each individual man. That's really our fundamental pursuit. So we can talk about these Degrees in a sort of concrete sense, but the real message of masonry is tremendously lost in that regard, because it's really not about the actual movements and the rituals, it's not about the actual words, it's about what's behind all that. - Overall theme of the Lodge of Perfection is this search for this cubical stone. This lost word which is alluded to in the Third Degree about this word has been lost upon the death of the master architect of King Solomon's Temple. As you progress through the Degrees of the Lodge of Perfection, the allegory of King Solomon's Temple is expanded upon. There is a funeral for the Master Hiram who was murdered, there is an anniversary of his death, and a lot of these things play into themes of daily life, about letting go, and taking the tie to grieve things, to be able to move on, to find the truth about things, to be able to continue to grow. What comes into focus there also is how important it is to transmit and share knowledge. When Master Hiram would finish his work at the end of the day he would love talking about the Egyptian mysteries with these five young men that he believed one day could take his place if something happened to him. That was important that he did that because one of them eventually does take his place and the work is then picked back up and they keep building the temple. Eventually, the assassins that murdered the Master Hiram are found and they're brought to justice. So as you come to the close of the Degrees of the Lodge of Perfection, you come upon the 13th and 14th Degrees. The 13th Degree is one of the most interesting Degrees in all of masonry to me because the story behind the 13th Degree is about the biblical character Enoch who received the true name of God, and he supposedly built these nine vaults deep down within the earth, vertical vaults and in the ninth vault, he placed the true name of God there, for future generations to discover that. That vertical line of those vaults represents spirituality. So it's about going within the self to discover the truth, and bringing that forward and emanating that light out into the world. - There's also a focus on the nature of man and the surroundings that we find ourselves. You're encouraged to not only study but then also understand how you fit into the natural order of things. - If I take it out of the realm of the literal, out of the realm of trying to understand everything like something that actually happened in a year, BC, and look within myself and say what part of myself is Enoch? How can I connect to that? What do I need to cast away to connect to that? What purifications do I need to do to connect with this Enoch character that actually lives within me? And what is this thing that's buried in me in the ninth vault, in my heart? What is this thing that's buried? If I want to search for that thing, it might help to know where it's buried. - In the 14th Degree, the really fascinating part of the story in the Masonic allegory is that when King Solomon was building his temple, there were nine crypts built horizontally underneath King Solomon's Temple. What begins to come into appearance here is a very very interesting symbol. When you take the vertical line of the vaults that Enoch built and buried this divine spark at the bottom of it, and you take the horizontal line of the crypts underneath King Solomon's Temple you begin to see the symbol of the cross, and that's a very powerful symbol when you look at it like that because the crypts, the horizontal crypts represent the earthly and it's about progressing through these nine arches, these nine crypts and improving the self through study, through constant refinement, through subduing our passions, and trying to find that balance, and as we do that we begin to also ascend at that same time that spiritual path upwards. The Lodge of Perfection concludes with the preservation of that which was lost and is now found again, that lost word, that name of God as a symbol, but that divine spark, and it reminds me of the verse in the Book of John, when it says, "In the beginning was the word, "and the word was with God, and the word was God." So as you see these things start to be revealed and the word revealed means revel, so one thing is revealed to you, but it's hidden by another thing and that's the nature of God in a sense, is that God will reveal one thing, and then veil it in another way because it's the constant quest of the infinite of seeking light and seeking this knowledge. It's a constant refinement of the self. As we see that symbol of the cross appear between the vaults of Enoch and the crypts of Solomon, you start to understand the importance of understanding Kabbalah as a symbol and as a way to understand how these things are presented. Not as a dogma, or as a religion, but to learn from the symbolism and the wisdom that that school of thought brings into Freemasonry. It allows us to understand the importance of playing the peacemaker in life, and to if we have to be the judge, to be impartial in situations. - The stories being told is profound. Very influential on the mind and the psyche, and it brings you into a state of understanding, that none of the other degrees actually brought me into. Yes, you're looking for the lost word, but most importantly, you're actually discovering the word within yourself, you're discovering who you are, you're discovering the purpose of this, you're recognizing that there is a true value underneath wanting to just be a mason. - Uncovering the word is an allegory for discovering yourself, improving yourself and understanding the mysteries of life. - You're dealing with these great universal secrets and into that realm of communication and this time outside of time. Freemasonry basically has preserved the best of mankind, that's why we harken back to ancient times, that's why we ruminate on Greek and Cerastrian philosophy in the Scottish Rite. It brings us back to these times when mankind was searching for these answers, these eternal questions that we have, and we're still doing it of course, but it puts us in that mood of where the ancients were. - So one of the things Freemasonry addressed particularly on what were called the Higher Degrees such as the Scottish Rite was to consider the journey of manhood as the hero's quest. We applied contemporary mythos around the old ideas. So what Freemasonry has become in our time is a set of lessons that helps a man become consciously aware of what he's here to do. - That's the first body, the second body is called the Chapter of Rose Croix, which really ought to be Rose Croix, but I pronounce it the other way 99% of the time, it means rose and cross. 15th and 16th deal with principles ethics essentially. They deal with the question of how do you know what's right? Is right always right? Is the same thing always right? Or are right and wrong hardly defined classifications you can deal with? - The 15th and 16th Degrees get into the story of building the second temple and it it can be looked at from a sense of these things that we go through in life, like this constant, again, whether it's a career or a marriage or friendships or family, we have these great things that we build up and we have these great moments, and then there destroyed right in front of our eyes. - The 17th Degree is based on the Book of Revelation, or takes its thematic material from the Book of Revelation. It, to me, is all about energy. One of the questions that you always have is where does the dynamic of life come from, where does the energy to do things come from and part of it obviously is purely mental, purely emotional, spiritual. Take your pick. And the 17th Degree is about that, about the power which comes into a person when they are doing what they should be doing, when they are paying attention. Then comes the 18th, and the 18th is one of the most beautiful Degrees of all the Scottish Rite. It is the Knight Rose Croix. It is structured around the story of Jesus of Nazareth. Not as a redeemer, but as an example, as an archetype because the Scottish Rite is nonsectarian. But it does, part of the language says, if he were nothing more, he was surely the ideal of the race made whole. The great teacher, the exemplar. And it talks about the love and the caring. He died in agony, not cursing humanity but uttering blessings upon it. That's an important set of lessons. It sort of is the question of what should be your model. If you're gonna try to live a productive useful life, what kind of model can you find? - The one thing that I would say is truly the mystery of Freemasonry is that it's love. It's a mystical state of being. It's little wonder that Christ spoke about love in a very deep and fulfilling way. It's a love for the soul. - One of the questions that started this whole story off for me about why death existed and why are things the way they are, why is there darkness? What starts to come into focus is that it's about love. It's not about fully comprehending why these things exist and it's about forgiveness. - When I look at these Degrees, I see all these characters in a dream, and I see myself in much the same way I would expect somebody may have experienced this in ancient times in the ancient mystery schools but in a modern context. I see myself projecting my own sense of who I am onto these various characters, to these various stories. Some of them have history to them, others are more symbolic. I see myself going through these transformations, they're making me a better person. - Those are the first two bodies. Then the third body is the Council of the Kadosh. Kadosh means separate. It's often translated as holy, but it's holy in the sense of being set apart from the rest of the world. So it's not an isolationist thing, but that which is more than the mundane world. It explores many many many different ideas, but the basic theme of them is, what kinds of things do you need to do and what kinds of things do you need to avoid to live productively, to be able to say at the end of it, hey, I didn't do too badly? What ideas should you hold onto? What ideas do you need to get rid of? Vengeance, anger? Despotism, purinant? All of those things are destructive, and the Scottish Rite does try to teach that they're not always obvious. It's pretty clear when somebody invades your country, takes it over and starts issuing laws and says you'll be killed if you don't, that you're dealing with a dictator, that's an easy thing to spot. It's less easy to spot if you find that one of your friends is spending all of his time trying to tell you what to do. Or that some other person you know is trying to substitute their judgment of right and wrong for yours. So dictatorship and despotism is an easy thing to have happen, and that's one of the things that the right warns against, you've got to guard yourself. If you're going to be independent, if you're going to be free to think, then you got to make sure you stay free to think. - The Consistory, finally, is the last of the organized pieces of the Scottish Rite and within the Consistory, we find the ultimate tying together of all the Scottish Rite Degrees, all the main themes that run through them all. Consequently, upon becoming a 32nd Degree Scottish Rite Mason, your title is Master of the Royal Secret because at this point, you have understood, at least you should have understood, all of the esoteric teachings that came before and how they're all tied together. - At the end of the 30 Degree, there's a lot of symbolism of death. At the beginning of the 31st Degree you're in another world. - The 31st Degree is one of my favorite Degrees and I think all Southern jurisdiction Scottish Rite Masons can agree that this is one of the absolute greatest Degrees within the Scottish Rite, it's a real gem. We go to amenti, the Egyptian Court of the Dead, where a new soul has arrived and must be judged by his actions. So among some of the chief characters we have are Osiris and Anubis, and Thoth, the giver of knowledge and the giver of life to the people. The soul makes its way through the Court of the Dead, and the Gods themselves are asked to weigh in and judge the soul's worthiness to enter into the afterlife. - This Degree teaches there's going to be some uncomfortable things in it that I will have to let go of. It makes a point that we have these human roles even if they might have spiritual titles such as Pope, or Bishop, or King, that has been ordained by God, that we will still die, all of us die, and that these temporal leaders can't crush that human spirit if it is wise, if it has abandoned the follies of the world, that there's parts of us that just remain eternal. - The 31st Degree catches you when you're feeling hey I've just about got it, and you can be feeling just a little self satisfied at that point, one thing I've survived all of them. Then it says okay, let's talk about what's real. There are these series of questions and they are questions that sneak up behind you, for example have you contributed to the United Way or other nice safe charities, but walked across the street to avoid the bag lady who needed money? To have done that do you dare call yourself a charitable person? Have you been perfectly willing to help people who need a hand up as long as you don't get dirty? Have you been so careful about your image that you didn't care what happened to other people? These things are easy to have happen. They really are. Along with more predictable questions like are you sure you have not tried to help put power in hands that don't deserve it? Or have you been nice to somebody just because they have power and you think you can get someplace by being nice to them, which is a really contemptible thing but a very human thing to do. It takes you through all of these because it's saying if you are going to know yourself then you've got to ask these questions, and it's fine just to say yes, I'm charitable, I believe in education, I believe in free government, and the question is how much do you believe in that? Are you willing to let people disagree with you? Are you willing to say okay I'm revolted by every single thing you are saying but I will absolutely defend your right to say it? The 32nd Degree, Master of the Royal Secret disappoints a lot of people, because they come to it expecting that the heavens are going to open, the scroll is going to unfold and there in letters of fire are going to be the 18 words that teach you how to control the weather, make sure crops never fail and all the rest of it. Low and behold, what they end up being told is you've known this all along. There is nothing new that you don't know. You know what's important, you know what is required to lead a good life and go do it. Some people are just absolutely crushed. They figure they are now going to be among those who are the King makers and they find out that there are no Kings to be made. - It's not about the external. It's completely about the internal and you realize that everything else is like dualism, a total illusion and that the oneness that pervades everything, ourselves, the world that we live in, the universe our world lives in, and everything that we can imagine, is all tied to that same divine spark, and that spark resides within all of us, and upon learning that, upon integrating that into our souls, into our very being, at that point we truly become 32nd Degree Scottish Rite Masons. - Now, there's something really important being told here. You come to the realization that the creator created you and you are the only one of you ever to exist in this universe, there can never be another you. - I confer the 33rd Degree here. As did my father before me if we're gonna talk about tradition. It, I think, contains one of Pike's most beautiful writing. I think it is just terrific stuff. It is not new information. Many people figure it's going to be. Finally I'm gonna get on the 33rd. Here's where I find out how I control the weather, and make Kings and all the rest of it, and that's not the point at all. The point is to remind you, well there's one place where it says Master of the Royal Secret is what you call somebody who's got a 32nd Degree, and the people are taking the Degrees, our 32nd Degree Masons, and Pike says Master of the Royal Secret, do you deserve that name you bear? Are you first and foremost among the performers of charity? Have you learned, have you studied? Are you sure you have not lost the key and therefore wander up and down the halls of this magnificent palace, thinking it is no such great structure at all, but only such as are built by ordinary men? If that is true, then the oracles of truth are encoded in you, and you are in name only a Master of the Royal Secret. Wow. You talk about laying it out. And he does that so often. Another of my favorite lines is the truths of philosophy and religion are for most men like the sun rays that strike upon the arctic snows. They glitter and are reflected but they do not penetrate and warm. So it's a Degree that reminds you of some of the important things and reminds you that there is a connecting thread in all of humanity. (dramatic chanting singing) (fire crackles) - The York Rite per se doesn't really exist. It's kind of an umbrella that's used to describe three separate and independent structures. The Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, The Council of Cryptic Masons, and the Commandery of Knights Templar, are three separate organizational bodies that make up the York Rite. It's the term we use to govern all of them. So the story that makes up the Chapter Degrees is primarily the story of the completion, dedication, destruction of the Temple of King Solomon. Of course there's important symbolism that carries throughout, in particular things like the key stone, which is an important symbol in the Mark Master Degree, the Most Excellent, and the Royal Arch Degree and further throughout the York Rite as well that ties all of them together in some way, but ultimately they are the story of our life, death, and rebirth. - There is an important lesson imparted in the course of this that number one shows you have to surmount the confusion and the pandemonium of everyday life, which is in essence the course traveled from Babylon to Jerusalem. Think about it, Babylon is a place of confusion, chaos, incoherence, and Jerusalem is a city of peace. We begin clearing away the rubble of the First Temple of Solomon, which is now historically in ruins. This is essentially the rubble of our life and the working tools in Royal Arch become the spade and the pick-axe and the crowbar, used to demonstrate to the candidate that it requires some heavy hand tools to pry away some of the rocks and boulders of your own prejudice and your own ignorance and your own lack of understanding. Then, they're sent off to dig into the ruins of the temple, and they find an opening that leads them down into a vault. How curious, a vault down inside the temple of which the rubble is the rubble of your life. So therefore the temple must be your temple, your temple, your self that has fallen to rag and ruin and now you have descended down into this vault, into the inner you and you come up from that vault with a variety of treasures hidden deep within you. These are presented to the three stationed officers who could easily be representing your super conscious, your conscious mind and your sub conscious mind. There are four veils, each of these veils has a banner attached to it, then the banners are the banners of the lion, the ox, the eagle, and the man. These banners are said to be emblematic of the four principle tribes of Israel. The principle tribes? Yeah, the principle tribes. Well why are they the principle tribes? What about the other tribes? Well, we believe there were 12 tribes plus the Levites who tended the Arch of the Covenant in the Sinai. These 12 tribes are very much like the 12 houses of the zodiac, and these four principle tribes are emblemized by the four principle tribes of the zodiac, or four cardinal signs of the zodiac, they're one and the same, four principle tribes, four cardinal signs of the zodiac, and they're in exactly the same place. Then, about 2,000 years ago, we have a new dispensation and that dispensation is in 326 under the reign of Constantine called Christianity. Christianity has a doctrine and they have their gospels and those gospels are represented by Mathew, Mark, Luke, and John. Curiously, they are represented by the very same emblems, the lion, the ox, the eagle, and the man. What is it trying to tell us? It spells the name of Yhwh, Y-H-W-H, and it's all buried deep within this ritual. (dramatic music) The Council of Cryptic Masons provides two different Degrees, the Royal and Select Master. Those Degrees were borrowed from the Scottish Rite. In order to help explain how we get from the lodge of Solomon to the Second Temple that is illustrated and demonstrated to us in the Royal Arch, so that becomes explanatory of the Royal Arch. - The Cryptic picks up on some things that happened in Hiram Abiff's life, you learn some more of the secrets and get a little bit more explanation on how things took place. They have this undertoe of symbolism that makes them very beautiful. There is a Third Degree in the Cryptic Council and that is the Super Excellent Master which sounds like something out of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, but that's more of a dramatic presentation and that really feels like a Scottish Rite Degree much more than a York Rite Degree, and it actually dips back into the timeframe of the Royal Arch itself and the destruction of the temple and depicts some of that drama. - I came into this looking for a system of moral, and esoteric instruction that would build me into a better version of myself that I could then really understand on a deeper level. - Jacques de Molay was a Grand Master of the Knights Templar during the crusades. He was actually burned at the stake. It's less of a burn and more of a slow roast. They really put this man through the ringer. The church wanted him to give up his so called Lieutenance and to turn over the wealth that the Templars had amassed and he refused. At its core, The Order is meant to instill that same characteristic, to be true to your word even when things aren't going your way. - Many people in masonry like to see the Knights Templars of the Crusades in their origins. They had a certain moral and ethical code and we liked to incorporate many of those codes into our ritual and Degree. - I had the honor of becoming a Knight Templar. I learned secrecy, and not secrecy that most anti masons want to pin on us as some subversive group that's trying to take over the world, but the secrecy of the inner self, and of the world, the mysteries that need to stay what they are. - If a mason holds to the Christian faith, then the Order of the Temple is something that he really should consider pursuing. It is such a deep spiritual experience. In masonry, we have so many opportunities for those deep transformative experiences. Some of them are more intellectual than others. Some of them are very emotional. Some of them open up new vistas of ways of thought into the teachings that we have. In the Order of Temple Degree, you're caused to represent someone who's joining the literal Knights Templar and you go through the pilgrims journey in moving from the traveler to the warrior, to eventually the Knight's Templar. It ties in to the Third Degree as well, it's pretty symbolic, as you move through the progression of masonry, I think it's a nice capstone. It wraps up the York Rite Degrees really well. - There's a huge huge huge difference between the York Rite and the Scottish Rite. Even though they're telling the same story, little different twists here and there but essentially the same stories. The massive difference at the end of the York Rite is that the York Rite requires you to declare an adherence to a set of dogmas. The Scottish Rite provides you with a myriad of dogmas, or facets of different dogmas, and tells you that you are free to sort this out for yourself, and to form your own conclusion about where you fit in this sequence of dogmas. What does this mean to you? The York Rite says this is what it means to you and you must sign on the dotted line. So there's a difference there, one tells you what to think, the other tells you to think for yourself. But they both kind of get you to the same point and then you have to decide at the very end exactly where you stand on the issues. Very very important, very profound experiences for every man to undertake. (mid tempo piano) - What will the fraternity be like in 100 years? My father, my grandfathers, my uncles were all very active in the fraternity. I grew up, the young man exposed to Freemasonry. Freemasonry has changed so much during my lifetime. It'd be hard to predict what it's going to be like. But there's certain things that have not changed. The fact that it's a symbolic system taught through Degrees only. That we have a ritual that, well it's evolved, not that much. I think those things will still be here in 100 years. Who will be a mason then? What are some of the things that masons might do out in the community? Those things will evolve over time. But, (clears throat) would attracted combatence in the English Civil War til one night, they aside their disputes in a country home and become Freemasons? That kind of spirit, I think will live on. - The outer trappings of Freemasonry change through the ages. Once our lodges were lit by candles, once we rode horses to lodge meetings, or came by moonlight, nowadays we travel in cars, we travel in planes to that. 100 years from now the external world will have changed. But the core values of Freemasonry will not have changed. The Grand Master 100 years from now is going to need to find ways to empower every mason to pursue that journey which is the heart of what Freemasonry is. I would suggest that he not forget that his primary job is that of a teacher. He is to teach those around that the principles of Freemasonry are eternal and that the pursuit of the journey of a Freemason regardless of the time and the era in which it happens, will be a challenge because the world is not an easy place to be in, but a Grand Master who is willing to help empower his lodges and his brethren to be masons will be doing what Freemasonry needs 100 years from now. - Nothing can take away or fundamentally alter the experience of the Masonic Degrees and the lessons we are taught within them. They have stayed consistent through all evolutions of man and society from hundreds of years ago, and is my sincere hope that they remain the same a hundred years from now. - The future of Freemasonry is in the hands of people who aren't here yet, and it is up to them to carry that torch into the future. Light has a unique characteristic that it fills all. I think that the seekers of that light can make a profound impact on others around them. By living that example, we can really make a change for the better. - Where this is gonna be in 10 years, I haven't a clue. I've given up guessing, but I am convinced that it is meeting a genuine need in the human psyche, and that as long as that's true, it's gonna be there. It's gonna survive. 20 years ago, I kind of had my doubts, but now, I know it's safe. - In the future, I think our greatest challenge is trying to assemble guys maybe more like myself that are vested in trying to help younger masons understand who and what they really are, and cultivate the divine gift that is within each and every one of us. - Masonry really teaches us that we're all brothers from the same creator. People of all religious creeds, all cultures, we're all living as brothers. When you understand that it really, a person of any faith can go to the Masonic altar and become a brother. - It is very important to value your brothers and value the lessons learned, and if you're gonna do anything in masonry, recognize that it's not anything that is modern. It has historic values that need to be continued. Yes, we understand that 100 years, 200 years, things are gonna change, but certain things must remain. The principles of knowledge must remain. You've got to vie for that, you've got to search for it, and you've got to make sure that you respect it because others before you certainly has put in a lot of work, tremendous work, and that came about simply because persons desired to continue this work through their craft, through their practice, through the brotherhood, through friendship, and I'd admonish you to continue to follow the trend so that two, three hundred years after you, the princeps and precepts still stands. Most important. - We have a saying in masonry that it takes good men and makes them better. Naturally the question I have is what is it making me better for? Why am I doing this? Am I just trying to make myself a better person for me so that I can feel like a better person or so I can wear some badge and have a good guy badge? I don't think that's really, where it's gonna stock. For me it's about making myself a better person so I can be part of a better world. So that the transformation that I feel, that I achieved within myself can carry forward through my actions into the world, and the lives of people around me that have no idea. They don't have any idea that I go and dress up and go through these really interesting rituals and Degrees. They might not ever know that. - I did find that there is without a doubt God. That when you find God, the paradox of finding God is that, it's a similar paradox in masonry which is that how do you speak of God? You can't put it into words necessarily. It's the same thing as far as the secrets of masonry go too, you can't describe it with the human tongue because all words are are symbols for thoughts. So it goes a lot deeper than just what's on the surface and that's what masonry is, it's a mystery school that teaches the importance of conquering these vices and super fluidities in our lives so that we can align our hearts and our minds with God and then have communion with God and speak with God, and ultimately find balance and find our way back home. - So that when it's all said and done, he can look back and he can have some sense of comfort that he has lived a good life, he has lived an examined life, and in the process of learning himself, he has taught other men how to be good men. Our ultimate goal is to live respected and die regretted. (mid tempo bright piano) (mid tempo bright piano) (mid tempo bright piano) (slow tempo piano) (slow tempo piano) (fast tempo piano) (mid tempo bright piano) (laughter) - [Man] That's it. - [Man] Dude, that looked so ridiculous and awesome. (laughter) That's going in the blooper section. (laughter)
