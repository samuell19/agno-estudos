Odesa Film/Video Studios Raisa Nedashkivska Olha Sumska in Natalia Motuzko's The Voice of Herbs Based on Valerii Shevchuk's short stories Is there anyone? Reveal yourselves! Is that you? The House Elf! Well, how are you, little one? So glad to see you! How's it going? Not too good, my friend Forest Elf... It's a dog's life out here. Yes, it is not easy for us. My thoughts exactly... We're miserable: we stay alive only if someone believes in us. How many of us died without deserving it. We're ghosts. Unwanted and unnecessary. We exist nonetheless. What is it? I want children. I'm a bachelor myself... Maybe I should get married, huh? You know as well as I do, little one, our kind lives without no family. We're allowed only to mess around. Inhuman, that's what it is. My world's empty, and there is so much beyond our primal imagination. Perhaps I should do some traveling? No, you must guard the house you're living in. Or don't they feed you? They do. So the village community tradition is kept? It is. Come here now. Here I am. Is this all yours?!! All mine. Let's go. Come on, let's go. Wait, what's here? My goats. No house. How many herbs! Those are my herbs. Mine, mine... Where is the lady herself? Are you referring to the mistress? Zhabonykha. She's not home. Whatever... These are my goats. Let go, give it back. What's there? This house is dead. There's no going in there. Why? Did you forget? My mistress is a witch. Come by, where there's no one home. Bye. Are you the one which is known as Zhabonykha? I'm not just dropping by for no reason. Do you hear me? Several days ago, I had a dream. You visited me, looking the same as now, and told me to come by. How old are you? Eighteen. In a dream, you asked me if I had a birthmark on my left arm. And I've shown you the birthmark. There it is. You told me I should be your apprentice. Were you waiting for me, or weren't you? Was I?.. Mistress, mistress... A doll. Such a doll! I see light in your soul, my child. You're so kind to me! What a night, oh, what a night!!! I have weird thoughts sometimes. About what? Oh, many things, like herbs and ground under our feet. How should I know... Sometimes I think of the sky and what's happening up there. I'm so ignorant, auntie. Don't consider yourself my apprentice yet. That's not for everybody. Not many are born with what it takes. You think I'm unworthy? If so, test me. Ah, why would you want to know magic? I haven't thought why; I just heard a voice and came. But why become a witch? So that nobody dares touch me. Dares touch you... You want to be the strongest. Go and sleep, and in the morning tell me if you did not change your mind. I would prefer if you did... Mokryna, Mokryna, my ill-fated teacher... Teach me, how to get rid of the messenger who came to get me? Told you not to bother me. Surrender to your fate. Have mercy, Mokryna... You, my Lord... or you, the devil... Who among you cursed me with this? Who wished me such misery? For me to surrender my life... Why the messenger came so early? Was it you, my Lord, or you, the devil? Why are you taking away my youth and beauty? Why the herbs are the love of my life, and not children which I could've raised? Why is the dark night my lover, and not a regular man? Was it you, my Lord, or you, the devil? I'm not afraid of God's judgement. I wasn't spreading misery,. I helped people. Humans may judge me all they can, but I'm ready to face my Lord's judgement. You hear me, White Man? I'm ready! You shouldn't argue with a messenger. Some of your sins will be atoned if you surrender peacefully. Mistress, my mistress. Let's go home. Leave me alone, little one. Go, I'll join you soon. Doll, a doll, such a doll. Are you starving? How could I, I ate your bread. Did you change your mind? I didn't. Do you know what'll happen to me soon as I finish teaching you?.. Hello. Good day to you. - Hello. All right, my child, pull out your hand. Fingers down, fingers down. And now, palm up. Fingers at ease, at ease. Look through your fingers. Finger down. Middle finger down. So, you see anything? I do. I do! A weak gray man, following his cart. He's on a leash. A gray face. Dear God! He's all ragged. There, you start seeing things. His body's covered in dust. Ah, he cries, auntie. What is that? That man's misery. Everyone carries their misery around, like a cart. Let's tell him! Did he ask you to? Never do something that nobody asked for. Most people don't like being reminded of their misery. There's a powerful law of nature, my girl: Our kind can see much more than we can act upon. It's not our will to change the world. Why are we seeing then? To comfort people. A person who's comforted takes life easier. Now, tell me, girl: is the gift of wizardry for doing good or bad? What about you? Were you gifted to do good or bad? Good only. Though, not always one can keep one's oath. So I was just like everyone else: being both good and bad sometimes. That's what I've heard. You're not evil, but you can do harm: to help one person and to harm another. That's it, the world is not all-in-one: everything has two sides to it. The world is vain. People do all they can to deceive themselves, but it's all an illusion, and nothing is new. What's up there that is new? Up there, everything is just calm. Nowhere is calm. Come on! Don't you misbehave! Forest Elf, uncle Forest Elf! What are you up to? Are you drinking? There, let's go. Angel of Death! Angel of Death! Hurry up, hide! Uncle Forest Elf, hurry, it's the Angel of Death! What is it? Swallows. Is that you, auntie? Don't auntie me. Where are we? This house is dead. It feels alive. What is it? Milk! How sweet! Come near. Stay there. Why? Be silent. Ah, rain, rain with sunshine! Rainy-rain! Are you scared? I am not. Sunshine and the rain, sunshine and the rain! Oh, how warm! Feels so good! Oh, it stopped. Are you frozen up, little one? I am not. Change, little one. You shouldn't wear secular clothing when dealing with sacred. Is it for me, auntie? Is this really me, auntie? You, my child, you. Yes, you're not just a regular girl. I haven't acknowledged it at first. Oh, auntie, see, my palms, my fingers shine like a sunlight. What it is? Something made of gold made its way into my palm. It's like an apple. It burns, it burns my palm. Here. Though it doesn't burn my skin, only makes it warm. It laughs, it moves, it is so good! What's happening to me? It flows through my hand, towards my heart. What's with me? Such wonderful joy! Such otherwordly bliss! Bliss, bliss! What's happening to me, auntie? What's happening? I'm so happy, joyful, exalted. What was that? Make a guess. You were laughing, not crying. It's love. Love. Remember, little one. Your only emotion is love from now on. But love doesn't just cause more love, it causes misery, too. Get up, little one. Enough sleep for you. Get up, get up. Time for a nocturnal lesson. Get up, get up, little one, I'm getting impatient. See, what a moon tonight. Are you a sleepwalker? My head is dizzy. Maybe we could do it tomorrow? Only today. Our time is sparse. Go to the well. Open it. Now, jump. What? No way! Do you want me to drown? I'm telling you, jump! You jump. I did, in my time. You jump. Jump! So, little one, you're still with us or what? Yes I am! A weird dream is what it is! The stars fall in the water, yellow and blue, like peaches from a tree. Tell me, what's next? We'll shake a star off the sky. Look carefully, and choose the one you like. Fine. Ah, auntie, a huge yellow star fell into the water! Near my feet. Look, here it is, fallen. See - the yellow one. There it is. Yellow, you say? We need the yellow one. Wait, we'll catch it with a net. Give it to me. Hands. My hands. What's with you, auntie? Oh, help me, my child. I can't do it by myself. Just a moment, just a moment. I'm writhing again. Just a moment, auntie. Come on. There. There it is. Ouch, so hot! Ah, it is so hot. There it is, my child. Your star. It will bring you your daily bread. Are you tired? Put your hands into a potion. It doesn't hurt anymore. It will soon. You, heal yourself too. Our kind does not heal ourselves. Are your hands better? Oh yeah. I bargained it just for one night. Ah, look, auntie, look. Such dew. How good. You'll be inhumanly strong, but unable to use that strength to save yourself. Wizards, my child, live lonely as an eagle. There's no cure for our loneliness. Embrace your loneliness as a destiny. Without loneliness, nothing sacred will open up. You'll be cooking from now on. You'll feed both of us. And I will. Tell me, why did the people leave this village? Why did they leave such devastation behind? Oh, my child, my child. Their souls are overgrown with weeds, same as this well. The people lost their faith, and were left to the whims of fate. The devil drove their souls off the Earth. The devil, what an imagination! This is superstition talking. The devil is your own sinful thoughts. Leave me out of this devil business. Is he as strong as you? Don't you laugh, girl, I feel the devil crawling nearby. You're a witch already, maybe you'll look for him? You're entering the secret which was meant for two only. I'm afraid of something terrible, little one. If the third soul is involved, it must be the devil himself. Who's that? Don't touch this one. The uncle had a bad dream. Let him sleep. I'll be quiet. He's the last house elf left in the village. What a dolly! What a... Is it for me? It is, my little dolly. Thank you, little one. Here. No, no. No. I feel presence, auntie. I see. A woman with a child. Bow down to her. And pray for me, so that in the afterlife I don't get tortured more than I deserve. Let Zhabonykha know not a torture she does not deserve. Bow down. Forgive them. They play as children do, and they do no harm. Why are you bothering me constantly? This is a young man I was in love with long ago. He died, we did not get a chance to marry. I want to ask, will I reunite with you when I die? You will. Or maybe not. Will I be able to marry you, my beloved? You will. Or maybe not. Why can't you tell me for sure? I'm too tired. Let go of me. I will. When I draw my last breath. You took my heart away. And never gave it back. Let go. You don't have to wait long. Just one more day. I can't bear it even for one more day. Why are you standing like that? I'm scared. I can't bear it even for one more day. It's all right. It'll all be fine. It's nothing. It's nothing... Herbs, my herbs, it's in your power to destroy, so destroy my pain. Ease my torture. What's happening to you? Auntie, I'm scared. You're so cold. Changed your mind, perhaps? I haven't. Did the women of this house sow any sorrow? Only kindness. They saved others from illness and devilry, which poisons souls. We didn't destroy people, we saved them. Understand it with your heart and eyes. Any attainment in this world is loss all over again. You should feel happy. I paid for the first secret with my hands. Auntie Zhabonykha, are you alive? Asleep, perhaps? This is not a night to be asleep. I haven't got my hands anymore, little one. But my legs still work, so I'll teach you how to make money. To make money? Night comes to an end, and we haven't got around to the most important thing. You should climb up the three steps, little one. To stay out of misery, to be protected from the world, and to excel at medicine. Take the jug. Come near the well. Open it. Ah, what is that? The light of that star we caught. Dip out the light. Close the well, so it does not scatter. You can't make a living relying on charity. It's a heavy line of work, my child, and a bitter one. The witch can't allow herself to be rich. If she wallows in wealth, she gets in trouble. Because the people are endlessly jealous. You won't live long as a rich witch. Once people get sick or miserable, they will beat and punish you, and finish you off with an aspen stake. So my lesson is: always stay poor. You hear me? I do. You're directing the light the wrong way. What is it, auntie? Silver? Silver. Take one coin, and not more. How's that? Do like everyone does. Take one. You take two, you're done for. Silver. Swear me on your heart and soul you won't break this rule. I swear. Let me be damned by everything sacred if I ever do. You take money only from those who lost count of it. I beg you, auntie, don't die! I have no wishes anymore. I don't wish to be a witch anymore because I don't want you to die. My child... I'll forget everything, I won't tell a single soul about it. You hear me, auntie? I'm scared. Auntie, wake up, I beg you! Too late, beautiful. You should've said 'no' back when I was healthy. You know too much now. You know, and I've forgotten. You're torturing me. We are torturing each other. All wizards die like that: they pass their knowledge on,. and lose it themselves. Don't be angry, my child, receive patiently what's left of my lessons. You don't know the main thing yet. Something without which our kind won't stay alive. What else, auntie? What else? Give it back, you hear me? Give it back!! Good morning, young lady. I don't recognize you. Good morning. I am not from around here. Where's the old one? She's weak. Her legs betray her. Sit down there, mister. It's all right. Sit down. You're blocking the light. You're also looking for help, or are you a relative of hers? A relative. And what do you want? What could I want, if she's weak. I thought those damned witches don't get ill. Why 'damned'? What, are they not? How could a regular person learn such wizardry? They are taught by devils! Or let's take those herbs. To me, they are all the same. The weed is a weed. But she knows which one cures what. Still, you come to her when you're desperate. And you don't know how desperate. That's what people say: love God, but be polite with the Devil, too. Maybe she fakes everything? Sweet God, she crawling up the wall, such is her pain. She's not faking: her legs and feet are all messed up. That's God's punishment. If God punishes you, the Devil can't do squat. What's for me to do with my problem? Give me an advice, girl. Perhaps you're in their clique, too? She's cousins with my mother. I don't mean like that. I mean, you're young yet so intelligent. Perhaps you're a witch too. No, I'm just visiting my aunt. It's a shame. Can I come in to ask a question? Hands and legs messed up, you say? Let her rot, I say! Why aren't you running away? Go, you silly girl, this witchery is contagious. Are you cold? Oh, my child... Does the potion make you warm? It does, my child, it does. I was afraid you'd run away. I got nowhere to run. I need my legs to work, just a little. Oh, I've asked them already. For this one day... Who are 'they'? Do you think I know who's above me? When I need something, I ask both: God and Devil. One of them helps me. What was that noise in the yard? A man came by. His name is Vasyl Korovoda. He's from Kalynivka, not far from here. I need to leave this house. The whole village will gather here soon. And we, my girl, will hide in the forest. And we'll start your education properly. I'll teach you how to deal with herbs. You hear me, little one? Where could we go? You're so weak, auntie. Well, my legs don't work, but we could fly. Fly? I'm light as a feather already, you'll see. Oh, sweet mother... I'm flying... Ah, auntie, look, there's our yard. Farewell! Mother... Pray for me. My mistress, my mistress. I came to say goodbye. Stay. No one will disturb us now. Just listen to this blissful silence. Tell me, auntie, haven't I met you before? When? How shall I know? A long time ago, so long ago I can't remember. Did you notice that with every secret you become stronger. and me, weaker? Do you feel my power inside you? Oh, auntie, yes I do, auntie. But it's not the Devil that possesses us, right? You had a bad vision. Devil is where people are wronged. See, a hedgehog. Don't waste time meaninglessly. There's no way you leave this path, and I won't as well. You're not just yourself. You're a part of everything in the universe. If you harm someone, you harm yourself. Same if you do something good. If you kill or you break, you break a part of yourself. Don't do that, silly girl. You bear more responsibility then those others. Is that your biggest secret, auntie? The biggest secret is right here, in my palm. It's the voice of herbs which I want you to hear, truly. I hear, I do! I hear now. I hear the voice of herbs! Auntie Zhabonykha,. where are you? It's dawning. I suppose the potion is ready. Look around you, is no one around? If somebody takes a peak, we both die. Not a soul. Don't keep me in your heart, silly girl. Don't call me to come from the other side and give you advice. Be on your own. Always be wise and indulgent, hear me? I hear. Drink. What if I want to quit? To live like everybody else? Drink, it's time. Drink a half of it precisely. You drank this for yourself. And now, another half, there you go, girl. Here, you drank myself. Wait a bit more, my beloved! Then the curse will be lifted. I became a witch, so that he doesn't forget me. What are we without love? So you want me to inherit your curse? You did already, my child. The rest, give me the rest. Give it to me. No, I don't want to. I'll forget everything. I don't have time, none at all. Where are you, auntie? No, no... Dolly... No... I don't want it, I don't... I didn't mean you no harm. Where are you, old granny, where are you? I'm inside you, you drank me. Don't be surprised, from now on we'll live as one. You'll know everything I knew. You paid for it in full. Just like I paid my teacher, Mokryna, a long time ago. Get away! Get away, you damned devil! Off with your wisdom! Don't curse needlessly. Once your weep yourself out, you'll be all right, and you'll love the potions. Mistress... Leave me. - Leave me be. - Let's go home. Let's... go home... Preserve my knowledge, my child. Let's go.
