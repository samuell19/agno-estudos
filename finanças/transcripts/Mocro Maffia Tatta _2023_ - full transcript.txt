What the fuck am I supposed to do with him? He's useless. What do you mean, 'what am I supposed to do with him'? Every time everything goes wrong with what you have to do. Seriously? I've always done everything for you. You're like a brother to me. Honestly, Tatta, nothing but fuck-ups. Time after time after time. I shot someone in the head for you, buddy. I missed my own brother's funeral for you. I'm going to find you, Tatta. I'm going to find you. I'm not coming around for a while, dickhead. Hey, baby. Glad you're here. Come lie with me. Are you okay? Go to sleep, we'll be out of here tomorrow. Fuck. -What the fuck? Wake up, wake up. Nino, Nino, come on. Grab the money. -Outside, outside. Get out, get out, get out. -Yes, yes, yes. Hurry, get out. -Come on, come on. Quick, quick. Go to the Mercedes. -Nino, come on. Damn it. Come on, come on, come on. Stay low. Dirty fucking whores. Fucking whores. I should have killed you right away. -You won't be able to hide anywhere. How did you find me? Come on, get in, get in. Key, key. -Fuck. I know exactly who these fucking dogs are. Wait here. One got away, I'm going to get them all. Watch. And then? -And then I'm going to get money. I'll take you to a hotel now. What do you think? Setting my family on fire? Run away, run. Burned down 700K, huh? -I don't know anything, man. I didn't know anything. You should talk to Arie. Arie is no longer here. How are you going to repay it? How are you going to repay it? Tell me, you bum. He stashed money here. Go get it, go get it. Run, run. Go, go, go. Why are we meeting in this weird place? Because this is the only time I can see my daughter. When are you leaving? In three weeks. To Mali. I can only offer you what I still have. What do you need? I don't need guns, my friend. I need your expertise. What is it? -It's a rip-off deal in the harbor. Coming up soon. -I'm really not doing that. You'll be paid handsomely. -I want to see my daughter grow up. Okay, fine. I'll check you out for another job, alright? Easy job. Did it work? -Yes, it's sorted. Sorted? -Yes, sorted. Those guys won't leave us alone, you know. Those guys from Brabant know exactly where they stand now, right? Was it Paus? Listen, if Paus had done this, he would have riddled our entire caravan with an AK-47, but he doesn't know where we are, so it's not him. Here, look. This is from Brabant. And you want to run away with this? Are you going to sell cotton candy in a year or something? And now? -Now I've arranged a house for us. What? Listen, I've secured a big house. It's in a forest. No one will find us. Take it easy. I just have one more job to do. Rinus... -You know what it is? It's 2000 kilos in the Antwerp harbor. I'm going to take it. And then we'll leave. Done. -You're going to rip off Paus? You want to leave, right? Don't you? We can do that once we're done here, right? Get in the car. Come on. Who's that now? -That's Melvin. He's security. Am I getting a babysitter? Listen, as long as I'm gone, yeah. Take off your shoes. Take off your shoes. This is a villa, you know. Is that guy also going to help you in Antwerp? No, he's not coming along anymore. -Why not? I don't know. He found it too dangerous or something. Great. So who are you going to do it with? -Someone else. And if they don't want to either? This person will definitely want to. Yeah, and until then, we're stuck with that clown. Yeah, in case someone throws another Molotov cocktail in here. Listen, once this shit is done, when you're 80 years old, to poop in golden diapers, yeah? Where are we going then? Thailand. -Thailand. What? -You're bringing up Thailand. You're already acting crazy when there's a mosquito here. But okay, we're going to Thailand. Yeah, right? I'm going to rent one of those crazy scooters. How long will you be gone? -Three days, maximum. You have me for five, right? After that, it's up to you. I'll pay you in five days what you earn in five months. With your buddies in the desert. So relax, yeah? It's all good, boss. -Yeah, it will definitely be fine. And don't call me for trivial things. Only if that shit is important. He had paid a year in advance. In cash. You said you were from the national police, right? Yes, national, yes. And that resident had been wanted for months. If I don't find him, Interpol will. Yes, very big. You don't have a new address for him or something? Absolutely nothing. -Nothing left behind? No. -Okay then. My colleagues will contact you. You'll hear from them. Of course. -Hey, good luck. Everything burned down there last night. -By whom? I don't know, man. Not by us. Maybe the "Kampers"? Mom. -Hey, girl. I was almost on the plane in Brussels. Is dad coming too? You can stay here for a while. That's nice, right? Come, should I take them to their room? Yes. -Yes? Come on, let's go. We shouldn't underestimate him, huh? This guy is crazy. We can handle one "rode kamper," right? Just let me go to Brabant once. Just let me have a little... -No. I already have enough headaches. "Tatta" has a weakness. Nobody is crazy enough to help him. What? No, I didn't do that. You're being released early. -I didn't ask for it. I don't want to leave. -I don't care. Come with me. I didn't ask for it. Sign here. -I want to speak to the director. Sign and get your things. This is a mistake. -Sign here. Get lost, fatty. Here, your mother. How much to keep me here? I'll pay whatever you want. I want to go back. -Get walking. I'll pay you. -Get walking. No, no, no. Get out of here. I'm done with you. I don't want to see you anymore. Get lost from here. I'm not saying it again. They'll kill me out there. Son of a bitch, open that gate. Son of a bitch. Hey, Karate Kid. Come here. Come. What are you doing here? I'm here to get you out of this shit, friend. Come. How much did you pay to get me out? Just say you want it back. I can go back inside. Don't be so stupid, please. Do you even know what you've done, fool? Friend, I paid 150K to get you out, huh. You did what? Then you must really need me, don't you? Come on, we need to get out of here. Give me the car keys. I'll drive. Kifesh, watch the road, man. Or should I drive? Kifesh? Just relax, Rinus. I taught you how to drive, remember? You're paranoid. I don't want to be followed. I don't exactly have friends here. If we take turns driving, we'll be in the Netherlands within a day and a half. I'm thirsty. Hey, what are you doing, man? There, I needed that. Yeah, you don't get that inside, huh. Come on, man. Drink. I'm not thirsty, man. Two scratch cards. And cigarettes. Can you pay? Here you go. Hey, there you go. Look now, man. Fucking hell, that's almost 200 euros. Here. Hey. Enjoy, man. Now you can pay for that shit yourself. Come on, drink. Who paid 150K for me? Are you and Jaouad... -Listen, listen. I paid that shit, huh. No one else. Calm down. Do you still talk to him? No, I don't talk to that cancer dog. Hey, kid, family, huh. Family is all that matters, boy. How's Joey doing? Yeah, just fine, right. Who do you still have in the Netherlands? Please, let's not talk about the Netherlands. Nobody there knows we're here, so don't worry. I'm not worried about people in the Netherlands. I'm worried about people here. Hey, crazy, you have to turn left soon. Left? What are we going to do then? -What do you think? Do you think you're the only one with family? -What do you mean? I'm married. You can say whatever you want, but I'm not leaving without them. And you didn't let them know about this? -Rinus, I'm telling you now, aren't I? Keep walking, kid. I want to get out of here quickly. Hey, babe. Hey, girl. Hey. What the fuck are you doing here? Grab your things, we have to leave now. -You didn't escape, did you? No, I didn't escape. -What happened? Grab your things, we have to leave. This is my brother Rinus. Everything is okay. Come on, hurry up. Honey, it will be fine. Why doesn't she shake my hand? Where are my clothes? -I don't know. Why didn't you call first? -Look at me. It'll be fine. Everything will be fine. Esmeralda, grab your things. Why do you live in a house here, man? Don't cry. Otto, is this shit going to take much longer? No, we're almost there. Okay, are you ready? Why doesn't she shake my hand? -Women. Don't bring it up. We'll talk about it later. Okay. Grab the bags. Come on. Hurry up. Kid, open the car. Stay calm. -What the fuck is this? What the fuck is this shit? Is this for us or not? Stay calm. It's my problem. You didn't want to leave, huh? Stay calm, big guy. Go to hell. Stay calm, dude. Stay calm. Take the girls, we're going. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Stay calm, man. What are you doing now? I wanted to come to you. Who are you? -I'm his brother. This guy owes me a lot of money. He was caught with something that belonged to me, but had no problem stealing half of it himself. What is he saying? He says you should shut up. Otherwise, we won't make it out alive. Shut up. My brother has the money as a down payment. What are you saying? Shut up. How do I get the rest then? That's my problem. Let me solve your problem. There is a young politician. Proud, modern, fanatic... who has vowed to end corruption and crime. You're going to put a bullet through her head. And if not, I'll put a bullet through the head of your family. Stay calm. I'll do whatever you want, okay? I'll kill that bitch, as long as you keep my family and brother out of it. No, no... -Shut up. No, we'll do this together. We'll do it together. Okay? Yes, agreed. Listen, cousin, my contact will pull it off. What about the security? Car in front of the truck, car behind. Enough spotters and soldiers. Then my good friend takes over. What's wrong? Okay. Once that cargo is out of the warehouse, we're safe. They will handle that. -That will be fine, ma'am. Yes? Will that be fine, ma'am? This can't go wrong. Did you hear me? They will only drive, right? I've brought in security specifically for this. Isn't that what you wanted? So I don't need to worry? I'm going to call my guy with the guns, right? And I've brought in a lot of people. Good. That's difficult. I can't just leave here. I can't get hold of that guy. Okay. I'll call you. Can you reach Rinus? No, I can't either. -Goddamn it. I have to go to court. I have a custody case. I have to go. -Yeah, what if they come here? What are you going to do then? What are you going to tell Rinus? I'll make sure you're safe. -Yeah... Okay. Nobody can come from the forest anymore. At least not in one piece. There are mines now. Here. There. And there too. There are tripwires in between. -Okay. It's important that nobody from the house goes to the forest now. I've placed transmitters at the front. If they go off, you'll get a notification here. If something happens, go to the attic. You have a gun, right? There's only one entrance. You can hold off an entire army there. And if you call me, I'll be here within an hour. Did you get inside or not? -No, man. There's a doorman. I couldn't get past him. We can't do it here on this street either. It's too crowded. The police station is right there on the corner. No, man. We have to do it in that garage. She can't escape from there. That's the only option. Hey. How do you know that crazy giant anyway? Gabor? -Yeah. Man, I used to sell car tires that were rejected in the Netherlands. Then I sold them here. Good business. Good business? As if you should go to prison for a hundred years for car tires. -Well... I could earn some extra money if I drove back with a certain trip for him. That's when I smuggled a few kilos off the top. Is this one from Rosa? Isn't it? This is the license plate, right? Yes, this is it. Look, and obviously I shouldn't have done that. No, obviously not. -Well, shit happens, right? Yeah, of course. -Well, shit happens, right? You're a dirty thief too. -You know me, right? You wouldn't give me a kilo of heroin, would you? You know I'd steal some. -Yeah, well... Who's sexy? -Come on, quickly, quickly. Is it her? Can we get in with this? Okay, listen. Her car is parked here, right? She'll definitely come through the stairs or elevator, right? We'll park our car somewhere here. We'll hit her when she's in that car. Then she won't be able to go anywhere. Come on, let's go get that car. Tell me now. Why do you need me so badly? You know those movies where they have that scene where they're going to do the very last job? This is that job, my friend. And then you'll quit? And just like that? Yeah, of course. Why not? And then? What will you do? Then I'll go to some crazy country. I'll lie on the beach. Play soccer with my son. All three of us? Do you want to come? And Joey? Do you know it? Huh? Why aren't you saying anything? What am I supposed to say to that? How was the funeral? He looked good. I paid for everything. You weren't there. -No, I wasn't there. Were you? Don't look at me like that. Since you left, I had to fix everything. I took care of everyone. Paid for everything, everything. And you were nowhere to be found, friend. -I did it for you, Rinus. Yeah, fine. It doesn't matter. It's very clear. You need money, I need your help. That's why I'm here. Done. That's it. What is it? Two thousand kilos of cocaine in the port of Antwerp. We have to remove it from there. Oh, so mister thought he could just take it away easily? Listen, this is shit for big boys, yeah? And if you do it, I'll give you a hundred kilos. Well, can't get any crazier than that. A hundred kilos. What are you trying to act tough now? A hundred kilos. Do you know how much money that's worth? And who gets the other 1900? Or you take those hundred kilos, build yourself a fancy villa somewhere, or you don't do it. You go upstairs, fuck a few cats, eat some goulash. Hey, what do you think, crazy? Of course, I'll help you, man. Even if I don't get anything for it. Are you sure you don't want an energy drink? Just set an alarm, man. Do you think that chick will leave in the middle of the night? Hey, I'm not taking any risks. You're dozing off here, man. How are we gonna fix this shit? After Pa, do you have anyone else... Or did I kill other people after Pa? I'm not particularly a fan, no. This is my problem, my shit. I'll solve it. I'll handle it. Are you sure? -Yes. Shit. Shit, shit. Hey, Rinus. Wake up, wake up. What's going on? -She's leaving and driving. Where's the weapon? Did you see her or not? -Yes, she's in there. Calm down. We'll fix that shit, right? -Yes. Where is she? Where is she? -Left. Left, left. Are you ready? -Yes. Sure? -Yes. At the red light, right? -Yes. Go. Go. Fuck. Shit, shit. Where were you? What the fuck is this? -What a fucking mess. Let me clap for you. -Fuck off, man. What a shitty mess. I thought she was in there, right? What do you mean, 'I thought she was in there'? Who else should be in there? You left me hanging. I was in position, right? Didn't you receive an assignment? -Talk normally. I killed a child because of you. -What, Rinus? You're such a loser, do you know that? Here. Take it. Pick it up then. You're so tough, aren't you? Answer that phone. And fix it then. Or should I do it? That asshole has my family, right? -Yes, exactly. Solve it then. Not by me, right? Or is it my fault that he has your family? Say it then, say it. Is it my fault or not? Here, take that phone and let me fix that shit for you. Just walk away, please. Herman Brood. Listen, stay strong. Understand? We'll fix that shit. It'll be okay. Stay calm. Congratulations, you really fucked this up nicely. Killing a child. Now she'll become a national heroine. With triple security. Are you sure it's fucked? I think she got the message. That bitch will break within a month. Get your hands off me, damn it. Leave me alone. Get in that car. Get in, get in. What do you think? If you kill them, you ruin a good deal. What kind of deal? There's 2000 kilos of cocaine waiting for me in the port of Antwerp. But I need someone to steal it for me. That's why I got him released. Do you think I paid 150,000 for his pretty face? No, I need his help. So you think you bought him? -What do you mean? Do you think this is a backward country where you can walk into a prison with a bag of money to walk out with anyone you want? I needed someone desperate or dumb enough to do this quickly. And then you came along. So you thought you'd get two for the price of one, did you? Then Otto and I aren't the only ones getting screwed today. So what's your plan? -Listen, I have a problem. No one wants to work with me anymore. But I have those 2000 kilos and you have to steal them for me. Okay? I'll give you 50 percent. That's too much risk for 50 percent. -Why, risk? You still have them. You can shoot them whenever you want if this goes wrong. There's no risk. -You'll get 10 percent. 60-40. 80-20. That's my final offer. 80-20 is good. Perfect. Good. Brother. License plates switched, GPS disabled. These vans are clean, man. -Good work, boys. Yeah? No more stress? Stress? Hey, buddy, mind your own business. What stress? Alright, brother. Relax. No problem. It'll be fine. How's it going, Rambo? -You called? Are you wanted by Interpol or something? -I was dealing with some things. Hey, buddy, what if things go wrong? It won't go wrong, okay? It will work out. One hundred percent. In English. I think he wants us to speak English. Fuck him. See those motherfuckers stuck in the backseat. Fuck them. -They understand that anyway, right? One call and your family will come back dead. Leave him, leave him. Yo, come. Listen, your men need to stop with the threats. They're just doing what they were told. By whom? By you or your father? My father's problem is that he trusts people too quickly who don't meet the expectations. Like your brother. I heard something else. Your brother had qualities, my father saw that. That's why he wanted to work with him. But then he got caught and half the shipment was gone. How do you know the police didn't catch them? How well do you know your brother? He could have been much more successful if he hadn't screwed things up. I hope you don't make the same mistakes. We'll see. Let's start driving before it gets dark. Hey, come on. Let's go. Come on, we're going. Something's not right here. You go that way and you come with me. You go there, I'll go upstairs. They're upstairs, they're upstairs. Rinus? -Chantal? Yeah, goddamn it. -What is this? Why did you bring three of those cars now? You almost shot me in the head, man. Come, come. Are these friends of your brother or something? -Yeah, something like that, yeah. And a hotel wasn't good enough for them? -Listen... This clown here screwed up everything. That's why they're watching us now. What happened there? You're not going to say anything? You drag us everywhere, you go off to Hungary, you come back with your brother and a bunch of Hungarians and I have to pretend like nothing's going on? You want to go to Thailand, right? -Not if it's a group vacation. Please, I don't want any trouble now. Please. I... Hey, a car is entering here. Go upstairs with him, please. Man, go outside. Jesus, Rinus. What the fuck? You think: I'll leave them alone? I had to go there. Otherwise, I would have lost my daughter. And what if a gang of crazy Moroccans had shown up at the door, huh? What then? They don't even know that you're here, man. Oh yeah? I got a call. -Tonnano called, yeah. But I didn't say anything. He thinks I'm in Mali. So he doesn't know where we are? -Otherwise, you wouldn't be here, man. You're going to get those weapons for me now. As if I... -Shut up now, please, yeah? Don't embarrass yourself here, please. Do you understand? Keep talking and I'll cut your tongue out, yeah? Get those weapons. Who the hell is this? He's a guard, a commando. He's nothing. We need to talk. What's up? -What's the plan? Listen, they can go to three locations to split and distribute the coke. Tomorrow, Otto and I will find the location where they'll do that. That's not what you said. You said the coke was in the harbor and easy to steal. Going to the harbor with weapons is suicide because they expect us there. We'll attack them where they think they're safe. And tomorrow we'll know the location. It'll be a piece of cake. Do you trust that guy? No, I don't trust him. But if he screws me over, I'll kill his family. And he has weapons, so that's good for us. Okay. What were you talking about? -Nothing. Make sure you're not seen, okay? -Sorry? This definitely isn't it. It's filled with police vehicles. Hey. What are you doing here? Sorry, I'm lost. -Who are you? You're my friend. Yeah. This is the place. Are you sure? -One hundred percent sure. Your buddy is walking around there. What's his name? That chubby guy. Tonnano? -Yeah, come on. Why are you so agitated? -What? Nothing. No? -No. I'll call them. Yeah, we found the location. Have someone there 24/7. You should become an orthopedagogue. -Maybe. In your peanut brain, you have two brain cells. Are you going to become an orthopedagogue? Shut up. What's wrong? Some guy who was walking around here. I see him, he immediately punches me in the face. Is he fat or what? Take a look. -Barry, where? I'm telling you. There, man. Some fat Eastern European or something. I don't know. Why are they laughing? Is something wrong? They emptied the warehouse and left. What the fuck happened there? Come here. What the hell is happening? Why were you paranoid in the car? Nothing, man. I just ran a sprint, yeah? Oh yeah? -Yeah. Then why is the warehouse now empty? Rinus, I don't know. That has nothing to do with me, right? I'll see your nose grow like Pinocchio. Hey, I'm walking there, right? Suddenly a Turk jumps in front of me. What was I supposed to do? -You shouldn't have been seen. But I knocked him down, right? Tell me exactly what that guy looked like. Why does everything always go wrong with you, man? Always a headache, always. Kid, this is the only useful thing I've learned from you. Do it a bit quickly, yeah? -Yeah, yeah. It'll be fine. Hey, his lights are turning on. How far are you? Wait a moment, it's almost done. -Huh? Just a little longer. Put that thing in and come back. -Yeah, yeah. Calm down. Almost there, almost there. -The light in the hallway turned on. Get out. Yeah, almost there. -No, not almost there. Get out. Now. Done. Yeah? Come on, hurry up. Is it good? -Yeah. That's him, that Turk. Look at him with his little mirror. He acts like he's the American embassy. Come on, let's go. Should we give it a try? You wouldn't think you're brothers. Make sure the magazine is properly locked, round chambered. Safety off. Listen, is it possible to sell my share, the 20 percent? Right now? -Yes. Or do you need to call your father for that? You won't get the jackpot if you want to sell now. I don't need the jackpot either. 15 million. Five. -Fuck off, five? Eleven. Eleven is too much. How much then? Eight. -Eight? Eight is good. And how much will he get from that? He has to work for his money first, then we'll see. And finger on the trigger only when you're about to shoot. Yeah, ready. The plan remains the same. When they enter the warehouse with the vans, we strike. That's when they're vulnerable. It'll be easy. Rinus. Check that shit. What is that? What do we do now, boss? We take all the weapons we have, we storm in, and we fuck them over. Come on, let's go. Come on. Come here. You're just coming back, right? Ashraf. That one, that one, that one. Quickly, quickly. Grab, grab, you. Efficient. Hey. Go look outside, go look. Hey, run, run. Outside, outside. Run, run. Away, away. Run. Hey, boys, there's a sniper there. Run, run, run. Okay, guys, they know we're here. What's your position? -I'm in the first position. Okay, outside is clear. Stay sharp, guys. Stay sharp now. They know we're here. Stay sharp. Yeah, here we go. Back, back, back. Retreat, retreat. -No, wait. We'll get them now. Focus. Come on, guys. Shit, shit, shit. Go. Otto, we need cover now. Where's that sniper, Otto? Fucking hell. Sniper, fall back. Hey, don't play dirty. What are you gonna do? Get rid of those weapons, bro. Hey, gangster. Look at your glasses, man. Such a shame. Of all these people you can rip off, look at what you're doing. Have you become a big boy now? Are you gonna steal a few bricks? You think I'm scared of Paus? You belong there. You belong in the shadows where people with big balls are, Tatta. I'll talk to you when you stand in the shadows, my friend. You think: I'm irreplaceable. Paus will piss on you when he doesn't need you anymore, my friend. And you know it, but I know you, you're loyal. Remember when I was locked up with Cobus? You went to get my woman. That's loyalty, my friend. I haven't forgotten that shit, huh. Lower your weapons. I haven't forgotten, my friend. That's why you're gonna leave today. Yeah? And we'll meet again. Remember this moment. When he pisses on you. Yeah? Leave. Go. Come on, go away. Done, done. Okay, we're gonna load that shit up and then we're out of here. Come on. Impossible. How? How did these people know where I was? That can't be. And yet, they were there. Didn't I say: Leave me behind and go, Tatta? You were responsible. -I'm still responsible. I'm going back. I'll get him and that cargo back. Give me 24 hours. No. You think I'm working with this rat, huh? You know what I find funny? That you're still alive. Did I have to die, friend? Would that have been better? I'm going to talk to Paus. Brother, you know what you should do? You're gonna tell Jaouad this news. -All right. Okay. Welcome. We need to talk. Your family is downstairs. Go to them, okay? -Are you okay, friend? Yeah, I'm okay. So, where are you going now? To a place where I don't have to do shit all day. Will that make you happy, do you think? -Yes. I have an offer for you. Either you get what you agreed on with László. You fly to the sun and we never see each other again. Or? You push this cargo for me in Amsterdam. Why? You know Amsterdam. You have potential. And I don't want to disrupt my own market. The risk is too great. That's the whole idea of winning, my friend. You have to take risks to be able to win. I'll increase your share from 20 to 50. You know that's a good offer. Even if I wanted to, I don't have people. They will quickly understand there that you're the boss now. Because I'm sending all the people you need along with you. For 10 percent of the profit, of course. Today it's going to happen. What? -The operation. We're going with four people. No one can know about it. Keep your mouth shut.
