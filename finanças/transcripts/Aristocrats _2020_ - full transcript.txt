New Year, 2016 Where are you now? Everyone's waiting. Sis. Kazuko People from the countryside went back to their hometowns so Tokyo streets are empty. Well, I'm also from the countryside. Miss Are you from Tokyo? You can eat at the hotel from the new year. I'm envious. I often pick up customers there, but I've never been inside. Oh, pretty! It's Kazunoko. I came from the lobby, but there's no one who wears fur clothes on New Year's Day. You can see fur time to time, but it's no different from UNIQLO. Do you go to a place like UNIQLO? -She doesn't. -Yes, I go. Mom, you used to wear fur too, right? I can't wear it anymore. Oh, Mayuko. -Yes? -I'll give you if you want. I don't want. These days, people will criticize me if it's fur. True true. In overseas, they even spray paints. Eh? Even in Japan, there are outrages when celebrities wear fur. Outrages? That's barbaric. Barbaric! Grandma, how about giving it to Hanako? You're passing it on to Hanako again. By the way, is Hanako still not here yet? Yes, I contacted her but... Thank you. -Shall we eat then? -Shall we eat? Wow! It seems from Wakasa! This is my first time eating chiribushi. I see. Excuse me. Your party has arrived. I'm sorry I'm late. You finally made it. -Hanako, sit next to Grandma. -Yes. You're late. Where's your fiancée? I broke up with him today. What!? Wasn't that just a fight? We talked a lot but we can't get married anyway. Reason is? What did he say? The timing is not good. You can find a better man. Can you accept that? There's nothing you can do. Because this kid. You have no choice but to change your mind and move on. Right? If that's the case, there's nothing we can do. That person is a little fancy, isn't he? Even if you get married, I don't think it'll go well. So, I think it's a good opportunity. Hanako Why don't you think about dating the plastic surgeon again? Wait! Didn't we decide to find an outsider to succeed the hospital? Since she broke up, it's a different story. -No. Kazuko is already married. Mayuko, you're a dermatologist, right? And your marriage failed once. It's beauty dermatologist. Actually, Hanako... Among Dr. Fujisawa's disciples, there's a doctor who just came back from the U.S. -Right? -Yes Because it seems that he's not dating anyone, so how about with you? Oh my, isn't that good? If we connect hospitals, we can create a rehabilitation department. Shouldn't we put Hanako's feelings first? Even if the doctor is a good person, He won't be a decent guy anyway. Mayuko If he doesn't have a match even when he's a doctor, he must have a bad habit. So, what kind of man would you like? It'd be nice if it was an ordinary person. Those who can't get married are those who keep saying "ordinary person". It's difficult to find an ordinary person. How is it? I'm not obsessed with successors either. But you're 27 now, aren't you? Are you going to look for a new one and wait for him to propose? If you really get married at that age, can you have a baby? Hanako Family recommendations are the best. Didn't work for me. Stop it. Hanako Why don't you think about it one more time? Are you okay with it? Yes Now, it's settled! Let's eat! -Let's eat. -Let's do it. Let's eat. So, what's the conclusion? Hanako will go to matchmaking. Is matchmaking still a thing these days? Ah, everyone is doing it. Well, some cultures are not in films or dramas. Stay still. I'll take photo. Thank you. I'll continue to take pictures of the daughter. Thank you. All of you are wonderful! -Come in front of the chair. -Yes. Next year, Hanako will get married. Like this, we might not even be able to take pictures together, right? That's right, I'm getting a little lonely. Had she married a year later, it'll sure be a speeding marriage. Stop it. I'll take it. One more One more. I'll take a picture. Aristocrats (2021) Chapter 1 TOKYO (especially at its center, a certain class) Daichi Hakamada Stop it. Here it is! He's going to Hawaii. What is "#PowerCharge"? It's disgusting! Why is he breaking up on the day you're supposed to greet the relatives? Isn't it 'cause he couldn't run away if he met? Then, why did he propose? 'Cause I've put a lot of pressure on him too. I think it's hard for him to quit the job. Eh? Did he quit just to propose? That's not it. But, it's over now. My father decided to introduce me to a doctor. I'm seeing him next month. Isn't that too fast? That's enough. Ayako She came! I'm sorry I'm late. Happy New Year Happy New Year -Itsuko, long time no see. -Yeah, long time no see. Is your husband okay? Yeah, it's okay if I go back by the evening. How about you? We're fine because daddy takes care of us When will you go back to Germany? End of the month. We have a meeting for a concert in the summer. After that. That's awesome! No no. I told my mom, "Itsuko became a violinist." She's so excited about going to the concert. Really? Eh I'm glad. Should I ask you to play at my reception? -Yeah, okay. -Uh, okay? Great! Please. What should I do? I'm excited. Why? It's up to the parents. Itsuko, things are going well for you. It's not like that. If things go well there, how would I be looking for a job in Japan? It's not something to hurry up. Everyone gets married like parachutists. Isn't that too fast? We're still in 20s. But in our case, we were raised that way. Well... In our elementary school group, only us are single. Want me to introduce you to someone? No. I'm going to matchmaking so it's bad if I refuse the person. Things don't go that well! Ayako also found the right match over the years, didn't she? I think it's pretty difficult to find a good person in one matchmaking. I'll introduce. Watanabe, my disciple. Here is... Hanako, the third daughter of my old friend Haibara. Nice to meet you. Anyway, take it easy today. I'm so glad I joined on a day like this. Do you like taking photos? I said it! After all, an elite who plays for a while but becomes stable is the best. He doesn't have strange fantasies for women. Welcome Oh, do you have a reservation for Camire? He's been waiting, over there. -There? -Yes. How do you know each other? A drinking buddy? Have a good job and pretty high specs. You may transfer abroad again? It must be hard. No, I want to go. If I go over there, I can spend more time for golf. What is it? Shall I set up a clinic there too? You play golf? Yes, recently. I was with a rich man. Eh, please flirt me too. -Okay, let's go together next time. -Yes, thank you. Ah, sorry. Yes. By the way, what do you do? Well, I help with the housework now? Help with housework? What are you actually doing? Learning or going to a concert. I listen to a lot of classical music. I've been to this store a few times. Eh, do you listen to jazz? Yes That's your ex-boyfriend's hobby, right? No, I've been learning the piano since I was little. A girl who says 'I like jazz' is mostly influenced by the man. Then, when she goes home, she just listens to a weird J-pop CD. Isn't he a good match for your remarriage? There's no way a guy like that chooses me. Why are you choosing between troublemaker and playboy? There's no ordinary person! You said it's difficult to be ordinary! No, but I just said too much hope is not good. It depends on how reliable and how many insignificant things he can do every day. "I don't like to throw away trash or change diapers" "I will work hard when the world is ruined." Won't it be difficult like that? Wait, you're asking Shin to take out the trash? -Absolutely! -Hahaha What about the matchmaking? How was the person you saw last week? -Thank you. -Huh? That's enough. What? What if you introduce to her? -I'm back. -Welcome back. Can you give it to me too? Yes I have botamochi. I don't like it. If you insist on a doctor, it'd be really late. Yeah It would be difficult if rumors spread too much. It's okay. You just haven't met one yet. There must be someone perfect for you. If I can't meet, it's the same as not having any. Meeting the right person is probably my biggest wish. Hello, did you buy botamochi? Ah, I only got the ones with laver. Eh, it's better without them. I can't help it, it's sold out in the morning. Is it my fault? Not my fault, right? Bring the tea. There're many married couples through the app called "Mariz". Is it like a dating app? So much better. It's like when you're looking for a room, you found a poster saying 'There is an empty room'. It's like that. Dating or getting married... If we find like real estates... Isn't it more efficient to match? Aren't you tired of evaluating a person by his job? When you get married, you'll see each other every day. More than the salary, I think someone comfortable to be with is the best. Right? What? May I introduce you? Hello, I'm Haibara. I just arrived in front of the restaurant. Ah, I'll come out. Yes Ms. Haibara Here. Hello! You're late. Did you run around outside? Ms. Haibara. -Yeah. -You're so cute. I said so, right? Sit down Awesome. You have great connections. Right? Am I doing good job? I'm sorry, draft beer! Cute! -Excuse me. -No, I'm still eating. I'm going to eat it. It's so delicious. Then hurry up and eat. What do you want? Draft beer? Such a cute girl won't drink draft beer. There's no such thing. -Latte, right? -No such thing. Latte? Fresh juice? -No. -Smoothie? I drink smoothie every morning. -I don't know! -Every morning -Go run outside. -No, I don't want to run. Would you like some banana juice? Just choose one. -Oh, yes. -What would you like to drink? -I'm sorry. -Yes. Can I get a wet towel? Alright -It's your fault. -Why is it my fault! Why is the lid open? The lid is stupid. This! I'm sorry. I am going to the restroom. -Restroom is inside. -Yes. Restroom? T/N: She used the formal language. -It's your fault. -Why is it my fault! Sorry! I'll ride on! To Shoto. Hanako What is it? You aren't ready yet? I'm ready. Are you going in that outfit? Is it weird? I think she doesn't have to be strict because he's my acquaintance. Right? Yep, she looks energetic. It feels like you're not new to it, right? What's good if she looks like a veteran in matchmaking? Stop with your feet now. Oh, taxi came. Eh? Hurry up and go. Yes. -There's a thread. -Huh? Wait a minute. Yes It's all right. -What about the front? -It's all right. Bye. Comb your hair properly. Yes. Sorry Thank you -Shall we go? -Yes -Shall we take a taxi if we go out on the road? -Yes Welcome It's a reservation under the name of Mr. Aoki. -Yes, he's already here. -Yes. -I'll take it. -Please. Here -Watch your feet. -Yes. Here. Ms. Haibara? I'm Hanako Haibara. Sorry to keep you waiting. No. Nice to meet you. This is Koichiro Aoki. Put your bag here. Would you like a drink first? Can you drink alcohol? Just a little. Then, I drink beer. I'll take the same. All right. I'm a little nervous. What did you hear about me from Mr. Okanoue? He said you were a counsel attorney. That's right. I became an advisor last year. I knew him just for a short time. Mr. Okanoue is your sister's husband, right? Yes My sister and I are more than 10 years apart. I have known him since elementary school. Then, he must be like a real brother. Excuse me. Excuse me. I had a late lunch so I just want some snacks. Is it okay with something light? Yes, I'm very hungry! Then, let's order full meal. Yes Your hair is wet. I bring rain with me. It always rains on important days. Thank you. So when she opened her eyes, she's back in Kansas. It's a completely different movie from what I remember. Really? What I like is... She see him once a year. Then, when I go back, shall I rent it again? Please Can we meet again? Would you like to meet again? Sure Where in Shoto? Is there such a thing? Wouldn't there be? Born in Minato Ward, went to Keio Uni Did graduate school at Tokyo Uni and now lawyer? He's hot, handsome. What kind of date do you have with him? It's ordinary. Go to the movies or eat. Many times, we just choose family restaurants. We decided to go to the villa next time. I can't even believe that you met him at a mysterious blind date. Come to think of it, his sister played the violin too. You might know her. Maybe Aoki Reiko's younger brother? Then, it would be a great family. Got it. The Aoki family has been engaged in maritime transport brokerage since Edo period, and is the king of shipping. That's what it says. He's the upper rank than our families. Upper rank? There was one in the school, right? The Surprising Cool Kid. Look, there are also politicians. Maybe one day, Koichiro will run for office too. Really? 'Cause for a kid born into a politician's house, You have a name that anyone can use like -taro or -ichiro, right? It's "Koichiro" and this "looks". Thank you. I'm glad. That's great, though. I thought you must be with a Tokyoite. Tokyoite? How to say. You were born in Shoto. You've been living in a place you can't come in from outside of Tokyo, have you? You're essentially different from people who come from other prefectures to work. I haven't thought about it. Because you live in Tokyo. you won't meet people from other classes. They are all nice photos. This is when my grandmother was still healthy. Oh, is this my former office building? What kind of work do your parents do? To put it roughly, is it retail? Lending warehouse to others. The company is run by a relative, so now my dad is just helping out a little. Is this your father? You look alike. I don't want to look like him. These are the daughters of my uncle. My cousins are all girls. I'm bored even when I go to a villa. Just boring photos, right? It was also customary for me to go to Karuizawa in the summer too. My sisters and I are far apart, so I get bullied every day. I've always been depressed while I was there. Hey Do you remember the first day we met? Eh? That day, I decided that "If I meet a good person, I'll get married." How about you? I'm serious, too. Then, will you be my wife? No? This is from when my mother gets married. It may be a little big. Should we fix the size when we go back? Miki Tokioka Did you take my charger? Chapter 2 Outside World (a rural city and a girl's destiny) New Year, 2017 Thank you for riding. We've arrived at Uozu. Thank you. Miki! Happy New Year Did you change cars again? I bought it from my senior. Did you pay mom back? I gave it back to her properly. The city is still dead. When are you going back to Tokyo? The day after tomorrow. Oh, shall we stop by Apita? I am working there. What? I won't go. I'm home. -Leave it open. -Yeah. I'm home. Miki, welcome back. Father? Maybe at pachinko? Keio University Keio University Entrance Ceremony Auntie, come on in. Hurry up and come in. Auntie, will you step aside a little? You covered the letters. Miki! Smile more. Sorry yes. OK How is it? -Let's take one more. -No. Did you see the huge silver egg-shaped object near the station? They called it Gintama. So, the street across from the station is called 'Hiyoura'. Hirata, you know it well. No, it's simpler than the exam. Isn't that internal student? Internal student? People who came up from high school. People from kindergarten are the most elite. Politicians or very rich people. So, those who take the exam like us? External student. Let's go. Did you decide what to choose? My mom told me to choose the common course but ... But won't that help you get a job? Yeah. Why did Miki choose English-American literature? In the future, I want to do a job that communicates with foreigners. I see. How about Rie? My father is the manager so... If I don't choose economy... Your order is here. Afternoon Tea Set Thank you Didn't you come here before? -Did you? -Yes It was a mandarin before. Yeah. Was there Ceylon tea before? It depends on the season. I was in Hong Kong the other day. Miki Your face is dead. I got Oolong Tea. It was so delicious. The scent is completely different. Are they aristocrats? Very good scent. I also drank it in Hong Kong and it smelled really good. Like vanilla. Something very sweet. I think there's a place in Japan where you can drink it. Did you take notes today? Will you lend it to me? Eh? I'll give it back to you after I copy it. Yes, thank you. I'll give it back to you next time. Are you back? Yes. Gifts. Sorry, I fell asleep. It's okay. Aren't you tired? It's finished now. Mom, where is the car key? Did you check your jumper pockets? Are you going out? It's no use staying home on New Year's Eve, right? Then, I wish you all the best this year. Sweet potato is delicious. I got it from Sanae. Would you like some sweet potatoes? No need. Eh? There are many. It gets soft quickly when you boil it. It's okay, I don't cook. Aren't you a woman? You should cook at least. Did father find a job? He went to job center, but can't make a decision. You may have to think about it later too. Eh!? To drop out of college? Not right now. Wait! Do you know how long I've studied? I'm not going back to Toyama just because he can't decide the job! You think only of yourself. Living here is hard too! You are even saying that. It's fine, I'll try something on my own. -The other day. -Yeah. You said you were very busy? I got a lot of texts. He said he knows what's going on just by looking at nails. There's no way to tell. Where are you going? High school reunion. Are you going on foot? Daisuke will send me. I'll call a taxi when I come back. Ask your mom to pick you up. It's hard to get Taxi on New Year's Day. Oh, Happy New Year. -Were you okay the other day? -It's all right. Would you like a drink? Then, can you hand it to me? Thanks Wait. Miki Long time no see. Yes. Sorry for not contacting you. Ah no no, It's okay! Do you work there? It's amazing! No, thing is... But I thought you would work at your father's. Ah, since there's my younger brother. Wouldn't the older sister in the company get in the way? Yes It doesn't matter 'cause I'll start a business on my own. Now, whenever I go on a business trip to Tokyo, I make connections. Awesome! No, because there's no job even if I try to change jobs. So, I thought I'd start a company. I see. I already missed my marriage age. Me too Because I'm not getting married, my father suddenly gave me 10,000 yen. "I'll buy you a swimsuit, catch a man from the sea" -So mean! -Crazy, right? Nonsense! I think his biggest misfortune after retirement is his daughter not getting married. I'm flattered. It's a matter of livelihood for us. Yes. How did Miki get into current company? I worked at a cabaret when I left college, right? I kept doing it while raising the store's rating. Was it when I was 25? A customer recommended me to the current company. It was hard, right? Yes It was impossible to pay tuition as a part-timer. Drink It's okay! Haven't you seen a sight like this in college? That idiot is now the third generation of the construction company. It's too bleak for the countryside. Are you enjoying? huh? You've changed. Sexy type now. Tokyo changed a lot. Eh? I got a room in this hotel. Well, it would be cheaper to stay than to go back. Eh? I'm trying to seduce you. Aren't you married? Yes, I have two children. It's rare to find a man who speaks honestly like me. Not at all. It's common. Excuse me. Should we go here next week? Okay. Happy New Year Chapter 3 Aftermath That's a great mansion. That was my great-grandfather's house before. What you see over is my uncle's house. Next is my parents'. Grandpa, I brought my fiancé. My name is Haibara Hanako. Thank you for inviting me today. Come in. Sit there. My father and mother. That's my aunt. I'll introduce my uncle next time. Do you still live with your parents? Yes, I live in Shoto, my birthplace. Isn't your family running a business? Have they decided on a successor? They haven't made a decision yet but... Someday, they'll ask a non-relative doctor and... My father will only run the business. I see. Have you studied abroad? I went to Canada for a short-term study in high school. Do you speak english? A little. Little? Then, you should study more. Ask questions in moderation. Oh my, I'm just chatting. Right? If there's anything, ask auntie. 'Cause she know all about this house. 'Cause we only have girls, My husband take Koichiro around a lot. My brother is an elected representative, so he's busy. He always takes care of Koichiro. Did you hear from Koichiro? No, we haven't talked about it yet. I see. Then, from now on, right? Ms. Hanako I investigated about you. Yes Being able to welcome someone who'll marry Koichiro is very enjoyable. Koichiro I think it'd be good to proceed. About Koichiro I'll entrust him to you. Yes. The 'investigate' that your grandpa said. Ah, isn't it an update? Investigate me? Isn't it a common thing? Because there're politicians among relatives. Is it delicious? It is delicious. You're the one who played, right? Oh yes, I'm Itsuko Sagara. This is Miki Tokioka. I plan parties as a job. Can you play for me next time? Ah, yes. Here's my business card. Ah, here. It's fine. You can write on me. Performance. It was great. Oh, thank you. Excuse me then. -Thank you. -Oh, thank you. Is this Hanako's fiancé? Miki Tokioka Your party has arrived. Hello, sorry to keep you waiting. No. One cup of coffee please. I got lost because I rarely come to Nihonbashi. Sorry to call you. It's fine, I was out for work. It's fun to come here. One more coming? Actually, this isn't a meeting for fun. Did you know that Koichiro Aoki is engaged? She said 'No' in a strange voice! After that, he said "My son is from Keio, too.", I was surprised. Not at all. -You are sleepy, right? -No no no -She said the conversation isn't fun. -Not fun? It's very interesting. Would you like some drink? Excuse me Refill Excuse me I might have lent you my notebook before. The 2020 Olympics held in Tokyo expressed a willingness to try again. Did I really not return your note? I've already said that 7 times. But isn't that too mean? I can't believe I didn't give it back. Yes, really mean. Well, I ended up dropping out. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to contribute to someone's grades? You're talking like someone else. 'Cause this isn't on my own intention. Me too. What? It's totally different. It's the same. Not the same. Ouch! I've never seen a woman cut her nails. Doesn't your mom do it? She will cut but... Maybe I can't see it? Strange family. Does it always rain when you go out? Yeah I don't want to talk to other people like I'm unlucky. But when it rains, it calms me down. 'Cause it always rains where I grew up. So, that's how it was. What would you like to do with him? No. It's not about competing against each other or blaming you. Before Hanako met Koichiro, She went on blind dates or matchmaking And she was quite nervous. Then, Koichiro appeared and she decided to get married. But, men surely had women problems, right? Well, yes. I'm talking like this but... My father also had a lot of affairs and had many women and children outside. But my mother doesn't break up with him for money or to save face. So... I want to be financially and mentally independent. Even if I get married, I want to be able to divorce at any time. It's nice to be someone who can divorce at any time. -Right? -Yes. When did you meet Koichiro? We reunited 10 years ago, I think? 10 years? Oh no, we weren't dating. I had a boyfriend that time. More than anything, he saw me as that kind of woman. That kind of woman? A woman you can call anytime? The last party, too. I was just called because I was a hostess. They just want us to smile and make the atmosphere. Women are to make the atmosphere? You really don't blame me. That's not my thing to meddle in. And, in Japan... They casually have standards for women, right? They laugh at old women or single women. Scare off mothers. They make women fight each other, right? I don't like that. There is no need to fight each other and cut our self-esteem. Yeah. I think she's here. Welcome. Nice to meet you. I'll change it. Earl Grey. All right. This is Hanako Haibara engaged to Koichiro Aoki. This is Miki Tokioka. Who was with Koichiro at the party. This from my mom. What is it? Ticket for Ohina-sama. If you go all the way to Nihonbashi, go see it with your friends, she said. If you like. Ohina-sama? Every early spring, Ohina-sama from Mitsui's house is exhibited. I've been there with my mom. But I'm not very interested. You go to the art museum with your mom? Yes, you go too, right? Yes I don't go out with my mom. It was in elementary school that I last put Ohina-sama. Really? We still decorate. My mom and grandma like it. Since we have there sisters, my mother decorates for three each year. Three people mean one for each? Yes Eh! Awesome! We don't do anything except Obon and New Year. Eh, Christmas? When I was young, I got gifts but... There's never been a tree. I can't believe it. Your order. Miki, would you like some more? It's okay. Are you engaged to Koichiro? Yes I didn't date him. I won't even meet him in the future, so don't worry. -I'm sorry. -No, it's me. What do you want to ask? What kind of person is Koichiro? What kind of question is that? It's only been half a year since I've known him. I wondered what kind of person when you saw him. Well I don't think he's that bad but... Eh? I don't know him either. I have never introduced him to friends or family. Maybe he didn't even know where I'm from? Nakano conducted an investigation. Yes, I'll check it out before the meeting. Miki Tokioka Let's stop seeing each other. What do you want to eat? What? What happened? Are you in trouble? No, I'm not. Yes, you are. Farewell gift. It's our hometown specialty. Farewell? That's sad. For the past 10 years. You were my best friend. You don't even know where I'm from. Thank you. Do you want it? Yes Oh, 3 came out. I didn't bring anything, so lend me your pajamas Ok. Is it difficult to start a business? 'Cause I don't have connections. I was in Tokyo for just 4 years in college. I can introduce you someone but... We broke up. It's okay. I'm proud you end it properly. Did I? I know. When I was finding a job, I also dated a man who had a wife. Really? Now that I think about it, he's not a great guy. At that time, you fall for an older man, right? Yeah Coming from the countryside and being exploited. We are the nourishment of Tokyo. If I get there first, can I wait in front of your house? Do you want to ride with me? Well, I want but... Well, since it's been a long time. That's tacky. It's good riding at the back. Chapter 4 Marriage This way. I'll take a picture. Okay? Thank you. I'll take a picture. Thank you. I'm not pregnant. You don't have to worry too much. But Grandpa is looking for it, right? Even if he has great-grandchildren, he won't be able to recognize. My friends are coming today, okay? For Hisako's baby shower. Sure. Say hello for me. Thanks What about you, Hanako? Well. We'll be just two for a while. Now, we're just left with Itsuko. Yes Is Itsuko planning to get married? Well, I think she has a boyfriend in Germany. Is she not interested in marriage? But can you make a living by playing violin? She came back because she can't make a living, right? Either way, it's too much to keep working. But when you're just at home, doesn't your husband hate it? Until we have a child, he said "Why don't you work a little?" He said "I don't want people around me making fun of my wife." But they don't like you to work properly. That's right, Like "Find work that you can also do housework." Father Don't cry. Mother It's crazy. Isn't it a crime of obscenity? I think so. I want to complain, but my brother was an idiot. It's candy. -Bye-bye -Bye-bye You're good with children. Isn't it upsetting if they think that you hate children 'cause you're single. If you're not going to have kids like this, why don't we shave there together? What is it? When you're taking care of yourself in the future, if it's smooth there You can just wipe it clean and it doesn't hurt. Let's spend money on ourselves and welcome beautiful aging. Talking about aging already? Yes! Our aging starts with hair loss there. It doesn't matter. It’s fun like high school students who say let’s dye our hair together during vacation. yes yes It's just moved to adult level. I see. So... The main point. huh? Let's start a business together? Eh? I did it all alone but... If you have the know-how from the current company, I think I can do many things. Of course, there's no guarantee that we'll do well. -Okay. Really? Really? why? Because it seemed like you wanted to say that all along. I see. I'm glad. Some drink? -Any beer here? -There won't. -Excuse me! -Yes Do you have beer? Yes. -Then, two beers. -Yes~ Too loud. Thank you for coming. She came. That's the ex-wife of my cousin, Yasunobu. She left with the little child. Are you talking about the child? It's unforgivable to take a child out of this house. Although it might not be intentional. Shouldn't she know about this? What? Well, I think she grew up differently. If it's true, it's half-half, right? But why is it 20% for Yasunobu? I know, right? It's you who took care of our father. We can't help it because he said so. If you succeed the company, Yasunobu won't be able to take both the inheritance and company, right? Won't the will be invalidated? He can object, but it seems difficult. Also if we could prove that he had dementia at the time he wrote the will. How do you prove it? I'm not an expert so I'll look for someone. What will happen to the inheritance if it goes to trial? We're prepared for this, right? You also need your campaign funds, right? We need more if Koichiro runs for office. Yasunobu is proud because he can get it. What is "running for office"? It won't be all of a sudden. First, I'll just become uncle's secretary. Can we talk tomorrow? Chapter 5 Wandering When are you coming back to Japan? About infertility treatment. If it's okay, I'll make an appointment next week. Mother-in-law Welcome. Sorry for calling. Oh, I have time. -Did you find the place right away? -Oh, I used the map. Really? Excuse me Darjeeling Milk Tea All right What's the matter? No, it's not a big deal. I want to work for a while. If there's something I can do, can you recommend me? Does Koichiro know? He can't come back because he's busy. Even if he comes back sometimes, he falls asleep tired. Now the secretary of the legislature? Still, my mother-in-law is... asking "When will we see our grandson?'" Well Aren't you supposed to have an heir? Koichiro's inheritance must've been decided since he was young. Eh? Hanako's child too. Shouldn't you have a male? So work, right? After all, it'd be better to consult with Koichiro. You should think for their family too. Yes At my grandfather's funeral, Their cousin's ex-wife was there. Oh! She came? My mother-in-law said so too. Everyone felt uncomfortable. I thought she was a nice person. They said you couldn't take the child with you if you got divorced. For that family, it'd be like that. Is it so? Yes. Because the world revolves around them. It's stupid, right? You just have to wait a little longer and wait for your mother-in-law to live in heaven. You too, close your eyes and get along. Welcome back. The soil. It smells good. I want to plant something. I haven't tried though. I think it'd be better to plant something like tomato at this time. Isn't it faster to just buy? Yeah. I just want to. Tell me if there's anything I can do. Marrying me is enough. But I still want you to tell me. Anything is fine. About things that are difficult. About your future dreams. Hanako... Do you have a dream? I just want to carry on the family's legacy. It's not a dream or prospect. I just grew up like that. It's also the same for our marriage. Let's go in. You can drop me there. I'm going to go shopping for a while. Then, warm up your body well. Miki! Come in. Do we have slippers? Oh, here it is. Here. Excuse me. Here. Thank you. Do you mean this? It's tacky but... It's easy to drink because I'm used to it. I don't like it at all, but somehow, it doesn't break. Don't you have a bowl like that? Well, you might not have it. Can I look around your room? Yes, go ahead. Isn't this your first time in such a terrible room? No. It's very comfortable. It's a small room, so it'll be comfortable. Not that 'Cause it's all Miki's. And that... I'm quitting my job this month and starting a business with a friend. It's a company that helps local companies for branding and PR. Create a new gift or plan an event. Awesome! I don't know if it will go well. Want to eat? Thank you, I've never seen a view like this before. Even when I've been living in Tokyo. Because we all live in a designated place. My hometown, too. They don't go out of town and just follow their parents' lives. Your world and our hometown are somehow alike. I don't know what's going on but... Wherever you were born, Even if there're the best days, There're also days when we want to cry, But if there's someone who you can tell what happened that day, Wouldn't it be enough? Husband or friend. You can't meet people like that unexpectedly. Welcome back. Shouldn't you say "I'm back"? I'm tired. But it was fun, Are your eyelashes that long? Did you watch the movie we talked about? What was it? The movie we talked about the day we first met. Ah, no. I thought you wouldn't watch it. Stop it, Tomoko Come on, sit down. We can't fight over divorce and hand it over to trial. Please go back today. How is it? Thank you. I'll take yours too. It's fine. It's fine. -Miki! -Huh? Smile more! Yes Cheese Yeah, it's good. We have 20 minutes. -I changed the projector. -Okay. Is he coming? Oh, he is coming but this one cancelled. I got it. Didn't we have tea with internal students at a place like this before? Ah, yes! We went out for tea and I had to pay 5,000 yen, I thought it was a scam. But coming from the countryside, After all, it's fun to come to a simple place like Tokyo. It's Tokyo that people who came from outside think of course. Yes, it was created with the admiration of everyone. Dream like Tokyo. 1 year later Hello Thank you. Are you kidding? Score it! Come on, pass. Hanako Pass! Can I borrow that bike? -Okay. -Thank you. It's fun! Look out! Help me! You're heavy, Itsuko! I'm not heavy. Hanako Why? This is Electoral District. I see. Right? How are you? Yes I'm working as Itsuko's manager right now. Manager? You? Yes Mr. Aoki, please. If it's okay for you, later? Yes! This year marks the 5th anniversary of "A small concert where parents and children enjoy together" It was held with the participation of many people. Thank you very much. The reason why this concert was held safely is due to the warm support of you. Then, up next. It's the Twilight Quartet. Please!
