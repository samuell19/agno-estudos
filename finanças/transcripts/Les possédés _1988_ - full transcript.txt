In 1870 a group of young nihilists, all from the same city ls returning from Switzerland to Russia. They intend to overthrow the existing regime. They are waiting for their leader Pierre to return. He should bring with him Nicholas Stavrogin, Who is considered to be the soul of the group, the new Messiah. Russia is alarmed. Everyone thinks about the coming of an inexorable revolution. Liberals are alert. But no one knows its nature or its true intentions. One of its members, a publisher named Shatov decides to leave the group. Not without fear, he is waiting for the return of Pierre and Stavrogin. Shatov... Hail, Shatov. I'm glad you're back. My dear friends, We can not live outside Russia. And to live in Russia all the more impossible. There is nothing to be done. What should we do? Destroy everything to the ground. But what about consequences? Some paradoxes to talk about, but it does not scare me. One can only talk. Except for the tsar of Russia and his family. Can discuss everything else, but not with you. To chat with Shatov, you must first tie him up. Look. He is leaving already. He's getting angry. Do not offend me, Stepan. Forgive me, Shatov. We talk too much, we who love the people. You do not like neither Russia nor the people. You have lost contact with them. And one who has no people has no God. Peter... My Son? You're back? Shut up, Dad. You look like an old crybaby. My life is so difficult. Really? Because I am still very active. Besides, I was being watched. My every step followed. I recently signed several protests. Against what? I don't really know. For the people. You are interested in people? You defend them? For a long time. So it's you who will change the world? Yes. Exactly like you wanted. You said: "We must make no concessions to injustice It must be hard! Yes! We will listen to you But you do not notice it "We must strike mercilessly." You're right. It is essential Are you ready to chop heads? Yes Three times, if needed It's easier than having ideas. And we will strike. Tooth for tooth, as stated in the Gospels. No, this is not in the Gospel. I have never read the damn book I have not read any other books! What matters is progress. But Shakespeare and Victor Hugo... Do not impede progress. We don't need books. Victor Hugo is an old ass. And our farmers do not need Shakespeare! They need shoes! And you are going to give it to them? Of course. Soon? In June. Yes, in June, all will stitch boots. Then what? I don't know! You ask stupid questions. I'm here to destroy. Others will build. The sooner we start, the better And then what? We'll see. It's not our business. Bravo! Bravo! Very well said. Wonderful. And that's good. Shigalev finished his treatise. We need to organize a meeting. You have a place? Yes, my home. My birthday will be the pretext. Excellent! Let us part now. See you later. Shatov. I will give you a text to be printed, and also leaflets. I think my letter was sufficiently clear. Do you still have the printing machine? I hid it. You should return it to us. Shatov... Stavrogin arrives tomorrow. - Even a monkey. Even a monkey. No one understands. Has Pierre arrived? Yes. You gave up? - No. I do not understand you. Want some tea? Yes. Do you know why people are not good? Because they do not know they are good. Thank you. They need to know that. And the world will be transformed. And the best way to say it to them is to blow their brains? Yes. To show them we are free. But, there are obstacles. What obstacles? Suffering. "Suffering"? Yes. Suffering. Let me give you an example. Imagine a huge stone, very large. It falls on you and crushes you. Would you be hurt? No. Wouldn't you be afraid? Of course. You know you are not going to suffer, but you're scared. Thank you. You should not care as much. The suffering is in the fear of the stone. One who overcomes the fear... will become God Do you understand? Kirilov, I believe everything will be decided soon. I know. It's simple. Ignorant. Even a monkey can understand. A monkey. Why nobody understands? If they find out that you intend to do away with them, they will not allow you to build this bridge. "Why"? You ask why. But all nature constantly shouts at his Creator: "Why?" Why the little captain Lebyadkin... must respond on behalf of all? I wanted to be called Ernest, but I was forced to use the ridiculous name of Ignatius. Why? I am a poet at heart But I was forced to live in a pigsty. Why? Because, in my opinion, Russia is a joke of nature. And not of reason. There you go. - Nicolas! Nicolas! Lisa, is that you? Hello. How are you? Why are you in Russia? I do not know. Can I kneel before you? You should not stay here. You are a lady. I am not your brother, your fiance, or your husband. For you I am a stranger. Take my arm. Let's go. Lebyadki n, bring a carriage. We were together in St. Petersburg. Lebyadkin! Nicholas and associated with rogues. This is how he met Lebyadkin and his sister. This buffoon flatterer. Isn't it? One day, in a tavern, someone insulted him that he is crippled. Nicholas got up and tossed him out the window. Nicolas treated her like a Marquise, that's all. Leave me alone, please. This poor creature ended up imagining things. Please excuse me. I didn't take care of my sister properly. Come on. Come. Come. Come home. Go. - Nicolas behaved in a chivalrous manner. "Chivalrous" yes. Can you believe him? Pierre lies only in exceptional circumstances. Mauritius Will you accompany me, If I become a cripple? You look great! It's me who is all twisted. What a beautiful couple we would be. Russian Mass Tea. Who wants tea? I have no money. Can I leave my ring? Yes, my daughter. And the earrings too? Yes, of course. Ah, you're here! I'm here. A Governor must show a serene face So I try to calm down. And where have you been? Stolen pearls. Even God is not very strong. A governor, however, must believe in God. If only to save the church. Kirflov? I beg you, come in. You play with the ball? Yes. It strengthens my back. Do you like children? "Children"? Yes, I love children. This is my landlady's child. So you love life. Yes, I love life. Why ? You always want blow your brains? Well? What is the connection here? Life is one thing. The death is another. Life exists. Death does not exist. When? When the organization asks me. Does that surprises you? No, no. I understand the meaning of suicide. The only thing I do not understand is why all men do not commit suicide. You look very happy. Yes, "I am very happy". The man is unhappy because he knows that he is happy. It would suffice him to know... how he can instantly become happy I realized this on Tuesday. No, last Wednesday. He was 2:35 pm I stopped the clock. As a sign that the time must stop. The trouble is that people do not know about it. Perhaps they should be informed. Everyone who did it was crucified. You lit the oil lamp? Yes, I did. You've become a believer? I did it for my landlady. Soon you will believe in God. Why ? If you knew you believe in God, then you believe in him. It's not that at all. It's a joke. Remember me. Farewell. I bought this gun with my last penny. Do not throw it away. I do not have bullets. It still costs money. Keep it. I've been waiting for you. You're late. You knew I'd come? I need you. Then why did you hit me? Because I was your wife's lover? Of course not. Then why? Because I have disappointed you? Yes. Because of your lie. You played a big role in my life. I have come to warn you, Shatov. You are in danger. They want to kill you. Kill me? How do you know? Because I'm one of them. You are a member of the organization? Is that it? Then why did you come to warn me? After all, I hit you. I return good for evil. I am a Christian. I would, If he did not lack the hare. The hare? For a stew, you need a hare. To believe in God, there must be a god. No, no, no, no! No blasphemy. Do you remember what you told me, before my return to Russia? What did I say? The Russians can save the world. Let every nation have one purpose: to find his god A God different from the other gods. No blasphemy. Indeed. I believed you! I'm flattered. And at the same time, you said the opposite to Kirilov. You poured a lie in his heart. You drove him to madness. Kirilov just told me he was perfectly happy. I have not deceived you. Then why are you telling us different things? I tried to convince myself. myself? I still believe in Russia. I believe the Second Coming of Christ will take place in Russia. I think... And believe in God? I believe in God. You do not believe. You're too smart. Not me. There are only a handful of exceptional men. Two ro three And you're one of them. The only one who can raise the banner. Peter said the same thing. But for other reasons. He talks about my extraordinary ability to commit crime. What do you think? Is it true that you have defiled a child? You said: "I see no difference... between a brutal act and a sacrifice" What both have the same beauty Do not lie to me. Nicolas Stavrogin can not lie to Shatov, That hit him in the face! I don't want to answer. I ask myself more mundane questions. For example... whether to live or whether to kill? As Kirilov? As Kirilov, yes. But it will go through. He is the Christ. Am' you? Me 'g I'm scared. I am afraid of being too loose. Maybe I'll do it tomorrow. And maybe never. I know what you mean. You're looking for retribution. Kiss the earth, your tears quenches it... and begs forgiveness! I am very sorry, Shatov, but I can not love you. If something happens to me, take care of my wife. Your wife? You are married ? Yes. Lebyadkin's sister is my wife. Ah, finally. Come in! I live like a monk. The samovar was boiling for eight hours, but it died out, like everything else in the world. And the sun, they say, will go out one day. Your sister is at home? Yes. She is waiting for you. She is not asleep? No, I don't think so. You meant so much in my miserable life! You have played an important role in my poor life. I even called you my Falstaff. You have not changed much during those four years. No, I am quite changed. I wrote my will. Interesting. What do you bequeath? And to whom? Oh, wait. Hold on. Sit down. You're welcome. I read that an American left his fortune to science, His skeleton to the Academy, and his skin to make a drum on which you play the American national anthem day and night. This is wonderful. We are pygmies compared to Americans. Yes, we are. If I did the same, I would be accused of socialism And my skin would be confiscated. Will you publish the will for a reward? What if it were so? Oh, my benefactor, I dream of going to Petersburg. I dream of revival. Can I get... Some money for this trip? No way. I have no money. And if I had why would I give it to you? Out of shame? Why would you be ashamed of your sister being my wife? The marriage was kept secret. A deadly secret. I intend to announce publicly... that your sister is my lawful wife. Huh? But... she's half crazy. I will arrange it. What do you say? I do not care. I married your sister after wine and dinner... for a bottle of champagne. And now I want to publicly announce it. That's all. What will become of me? You wanted to go to St. Petersburg You to "reborn" morally. Incidentally I heard you were going to denounce us hoping to get forgiveness. Tell me the truth Have you ever denounced anything? I have not had time. Maybe it's better I stay outside. The rooms here are small. I can overhear others. It is an idea, yes. So take my umbrella. Oh, your umbrella. Am I worthy of this honor? Every man is worthy of an umbrella. You have defined the minimum of human rights. I scared you? Forgive me. Hello, prince. You had a nightmare? I dreamed of you. No... Someone like you. Not you. Are you angry? Are you afraid I no longer love you? Sit down. I'm not going to look at you. And you do not look at me. Go. Do you recognize me? You have grown. Me? Prince... Please... Get up and come in. "Come in"? Where do I go? I have always wondered, for four years, now How he would enter. Go out into the other room. I'll take a book. And you shall go. That's enough. You must not be afraid. We will live in Switzerland. Tomorrow I'll... Shhh... Come! Come in! You have murdered him. Who? The one I was expecting. Who do you take me for, an idiot? Who paid you to come here? You came like a bad dream. As soon as I saw you, I thought: "it's not him It's not him "He is a prince " You are a lackey Shatov slapped you It makes you eat in the kitchen Something threatens me you want my death, but I have no fear I'm not afraid of your knife. My knife? Yes, your knife! You're hiding a pocket knife, I saw it. When you entered here is the knife. Down with the knife! They say you robbed a church? It was God's grace which drove me there. I did it because our brother arranged it. Excellent. Steal more, cut more. Opportunities abound. As Lebyadkin and the sister... No, no. Do not hit me. I'm just saying that they leave the door open every night. Anyone can kill them. Him and her, too. You already went to see him? Yes. Several times. You didn't kill them. I wondered: what would I gain? 150 rubles, maybe. While in waiting a little, I could gain ten times more. Yes. 1500 rubles. From whom would you get that? From you, for example. Yes. For the same job. So I said to Pierre. For people like us can not do without help. Three rubles. No more. The meeting started? Waiting for you. "The meeting"? Yes. Wis today . Come. Here. Lisa wrote to you. You should meet him. You still willing to help me? Of course. Last night I met a demon. But he was poor. I was furious That my demon is so poor. He offered to kill my wife and Lebyadkin For 1500 rubles. H". was a demon-accountant. What did you say? Nothing. I gave him some money. He must think I agree. Come. Excellent idea. I want to have fun. One point must be clear: I will not be your leader. But if I convince you. What role do you want me to play? You are a member of the committee. There is no committee. Yes, there is! You and me. For others, I give titles: Secretary, treasurer.. . They love it. The sentimental aspect is important, for the naive. There are also pure scums. What unites them all is fear. Reproach them for not being progressive And they no longer believe. They are ashamed to have their own opinion. - There is a better way for uniting the group. - Tell me. How many are they? Five. Four of them must kill the fifth. Under what pretext? Treason. Accused of betrayal and killed. Those who have shed the blood will be linked forever. This is one of your ideas, right? Since you want to kill Shatov. Me? But how... Do you think so? No. It is you who thinks about it. Happy birthday. Thank you. Sit down. Did you see that? It's the Bible. Open it. I believe in God, primarily at night. In the morning it goes away. A peddler was selling them. I slipped her photographs between the pages. How stupid! Why did you do that? Because I am seminarian. So what? In the seminary one suffers because of God. And hates it. That's insulting. It would even be shot. How can it be shot, if it doesn't exist? God does not exist? Of course not! If God does not exist how did I become a captain? Who is this officer? Who invited him? - Here, take them. Here they are. Hello, hello. Come in. If someone wants to talk about something important, let them begin. Let me ask a question: are we now meeting, or just came to visit? I propose to vote on meeting or no meeting. This is vague But I agree. - Yes. Me too. Lyamshin, the piano! Again? Let them think that we have a birthday party. Sit down and play. We are not spies, and even if someone was listening they would understand nothing. We ourselves have trouble understanding. Those who are for the meeting, raise your hand. I don't understand. Neither do I. If yes, raise your hand. "Yes" for what? For the meeting. No, not a meeting! I voted for the meeting! Why didn't you raise your hand? - You did not rise it either. How stupid! I lead the voting. I could not raise my hand! Good. Let's do it again! Who is against the meeting? Those who are for or against? Yes, those who are against. Raise hand or not? It depends. - You can not hear anything. Simple answer: meeting or not? Yes! We are not yet ripe for the Parliament! All agree? Hence, we will have the meeting! Quiet! Who wants to say something, Pierre? Me? No. Absolutely not. A glass of cognac. Stavrogin, and you? No, thank you. I don't drink. But you have something to say? Something to tell you? No, no. I wish to say the suffering of students How... Shut up! Sit down! I asked for the floor. You have it. I devoted myself to the study of the future society that will replace ours. The world of tomorrow, here he is! My organization system includes ten large chapters. I will explain it to you. I declare in advance that it not finalized. My conclusion contradicts my starting point. Starting from the limited freedom, I arrive at unlimited despotism. Yet there is no other solutions This contradiction has led me to some despair. But I repeat: this is the only solution. I suggest you read my book. Don't laugh! I know his system. He proposes to divide mankind into two parts: One tenth will have absolute authority over others, who will be like a herd. Having gone through several reincarnations, they reach the state of primitive innocence Something like primeval paradise. Which, however, will work. Gentlemen, Shigalev is too modest. His conclusions are based on latest scientific study of human nature. Do you have scissors? I have to cut my nails. He solved the problem of humanity, really. - Really? Yes. Thus, we obtain equality. All men are slaves and equal in slavery. Otherwise, they are not equal. Hence, they need to level up. We will lower the level of education and talents. As talented men want to rise, Unfortunately it will cut the tongue of Cicero Take out the eyes of Copernicus and stone Shakespeare. Here's my system. What I propose... is paradise. What nonsense! What did you say? I'm not talking about Shigalev, or his great ideas, But these idiots talk. I'm not here to discuss. This is unfortunate. You want to know the workings of our system? Yes! For this I must believe in you and myself I ask you to clearly answer one question. A very simple question. If you know about a contemplated political murder, will you denounce it? Do you denounce it or not? You? No, of course. You? No never. You? No. You? No. You? Not at all. You, Virginski? No. Hundred times no. I'm not secret police. Where are you going? This is disadvantageous for you. You will get used to that. We denounce? We have set ourselves. You too are going? You have not answered! I see no need. But we have to compromise, and you don't! I do not care. Nicolas... Leave me alone. I have to talk to you. It's urgent. Not for me. Pierre did not answer the question. He simply asked him. Nicolas... Nicolas, I need you. No, it's Shatov's blood you need. You managed to make it suspect. Clever of you to threw him out. Everyone is suspicious of him. This is your idea. Look at me. I'm not your man. Let's make peace. Let's make peace. Nicolas, come on. I'll bring you Lisa. I will leave Shatov quiet. So you really wanted to kill him? Listen... We will raise Russia. With these fools? We proclaim destruction, we light fires... So begins the mess! This will be an unprecedented upheaval. A thick mist descend on Russia. Earth mourn his gods. You have a fever. Or is cognac. No! I'm sober! We kill the desire for property. We will develop drunkenness We condone people cast into the abyss of debauchery. No more desires. Just a little fresh blood from time to time. You're a politician. You only think about yourself. You're not a socialist. Yes. I am a scoundrel. A scoundrel. You can not leave now. We are strong. No, you're not strong. No one is with you. Bandits and many others who do not know: Master that mocks God before his disciples All who fear of not being liberal enough Prosecutor acquitting criminals out of fear Even writers, journalists 7 without knowing it. The crime has become a moral, a generous protest. Why are you clinging to me? Because you're beautiful. I love beauty. I like idols. And you're my idol. Without you I am nothing. I do not want to carry this cross. But you're the leader, the Sun, the expected! I put out the word: "he's here, he is the new truth." The old barracks will collapse. We will raise a steel building. You're drunk. Don't mind how mad I am. Everything can be done tomorrow. I'll bring you Lisa. She will rush into your arms. I'm sure. Nicolas... Nicolas, I need you. Without you I am nothing. I am Columbus without America. Nicolas! Nicolas, Give me an answer tomorrow latest, the day after tomorrow! Give me an answer! Your Excellency. - What is it? A proclamation? Where did you get it? It fell from the sky? You take me for a fool? An ax? Why an ax? I will go. Tell him I'll go. What manners! Do not touch the chocolate! Leaflets? I saw them with an ax on them. They can be found everywhere. What? Yes Yes. Even my father. Your father? This is a friend who sends them abroad. But it's much too soon. No, it's because you are afraid. Tear down the church! You understand? It's too early. So, according to you, it is only a matter of time? How can you be official? But this is quite different. Not at all. We are not your enemies. We tell you: "Okay, shake go ahead, "We will support you and save you from yourself." So you work for us For you? And who is "you"? I learned something there, in Switzerland You knew the leaders? This is saying a lot. ...You will master it easily Just a little fist. And... And me? What do they say about me? In particular? I do not know. I have not been loaded yet to study your character. The crowd roars. They want to close the factory! And now they refuse to pay us our wages. Help us. Write a petition. - To the governor! Yes, to the governor. What are they doing? Waiting. Why wait? They do not say. Push them back! Scatter them. Scatter them. Do you understood? Scatter them. I suggest you go back to the old ways You are too soft. Not so soft. Is this a riot? I will flay you. Thieves! Guards! Guards! Hats off! All Of Them! On your knees! Everyone! At Once! On your knees! It's an order! Your Excellency... It was agreed... They have no right to chase us! The supervisor kicked us. Don't say everything at once! Rod! Bring the rod! Yes, your excellency! Go get them! Take them! Go! What arrogance! What impertinence! You have no shame? I will never tolerate atheism! Never ! Move! Faster! Go! Done, Your Excellency! Is this an uprising? Looks like it. The time has come You must show your will. Yes. In St. Petersburg, hear me! Move! Faster. Undress. Your Excellency... I beg you, as a noble man. Can you release one of them? Who? I'll tell you. Who? Shatov. Why? I'll be most grateful. I was his friend. Release Shatov! Okay. Shatov! Release the man named Shatov. Why? Order of the Governor. So go ahead. Shatov! Get dressed! You can go. Finally a friend. What are they doing ? This is a search. A seizure. I was waiting for this for 25 years. I gave them all their keys. Lie down. Come. Take all these books. I try to behave with dignity. I am only afraid to cry. What if I began a vinegar compress? Nastasia! Bring a blanket! I am going away. Yes. It's decided. I'll go to the village. But why leave? Shatov... They can send me to Siberia Or forget me in a bunker. Sir, calm down. It is not possible. Are you so sure you will forgive me? Forgive what? Shatov... Do you know what I fear the most? It's the whip. You did nothing. Exactly. They will see it, and they will flog me. The floor opens, you fall into a hole to the waist. When we fight a life for progress we must be ready for anything. Tell me, Shatov Why you came to see me? I needed someone to talk to. I'm confused. Shatov... You'll always be my little Shatov. I put you in my lap. I have taught you to read and write. I told you about some ideas. You have to forget everything. Everything. What did I learn? And What fruits do I reap now? Me, my son and others? You lit the oil lamp? Yes, just in case, to make a good impression, so they thought I have a question. What? There is an escaped convict in town. He hides. He steals and kills. Fifteen years ago this man was your serf. One day you sold him to pay a gambling debt. Remember? His name is Fedka. "Fed ka"? No, I don't remember. If you had not lost cards, would have you kill him? Shatov... Listen to me. Whole issue is whether Shakespeare ls more important than a jug of kerosene. I say yes. Shakespeare, Raphael are above socialism Above chemistry above all. Humanity may well not last without Englishmen, or the Germans, and even more so - without the Russian. It can live without bread, without science. But it can not live without beauty! Science itself could not exist without beauty. Shatov, that's the real secret. Without beauty, There would be nothing to do on Earth. - The suburb is burning. They say the factory is set on fire! My life's journey is completed. I am leaving. I have thirty-five rubles sewed into the lining of my jacket. What's going on? Fire! They know only hate and destruction. We have been walking on the streets for one hour. Marie? Marie? Is that you? Of course. Wait till I pay this idiot. Here. You shall have nothing more. You said Ascension street! And this is Epiphany! I told you: Filippov's house! You said you knew! Here, take more! What the hell do you want? How dare! Let's go quickly. All this is nonsense. Warning. Who started the fire? I am afraid that this is ours. It's just for tonight. I look for a job. If I bother you, tell me. I'll go to a hotel. I'm tired! But why a hotel? What a strange idea. Listen to me. Let me be clear: I'm not here because we're married. Marriage is a stupidity. Do you agree? We stayed together for how long? 15 days? Three weeks. Three or four years ago. That does not count. I returned to Russia to work. That's all. I do not consider myself as your wife. Be careful, steps are worn out. My small room is there. Come come. I was told that it was pathetic where you live, but still I don't think so. Come. Give me your hand. I'll get matches. We will have light. Sit down. I'm not here to show you my repentance. But I place you above the others. You're not like all those bastards. You're not angry with me? No. What for? Mary, you're here! I can not believe it. You look exhausted. Do not get mad. If you accepted it... Some tea? Yes. What, you're still a child! It's small, here. It's cold. I'm tired. Sit down! Put the bag down! I'll make fire. There is no firewood. I'll go get it. Oh... Kirilov, my wife returned. Marie? Yes. I need tea. It is hot. Take the samovar. Wait. Sugar. Thank you. Wait, there is veal. And firewood. You have forgiven your wife? Yes, I did. That's good. It's good that you still love your wife. Thank you. Kirilov... If you could... What? Give up your idea of committing suicide. If you could, What man would you... If you need me, come see me. I'm sure. Tomorrow I will give you everything. Thank you. Such a light dress! She probably caught cold. She is so proud! All she had to suffer... What if l...? Oh yes. Yes. Of course. I took your bed You did not wake up. I'll settle on chairs. I do not have enough chairs. Stay here. On the floor, then. I do not want to be in your care. I know a doctor. Should I call him? Tell me something. Do not stay there! Do not look at me, go. Do not be angry. I have a piece of veal and tea. Speak! If only you knew how everything has changed! Ours, mostly. They have so disappointed me. Cardboard Men. They are full of hatred. They will be deeply unhappy. If Russia was transformed, even in accordance with their ideas and became a very precious sight. They would have no one to hate. It all comes down to a deep hatred towards Russia. Animal hatred. What's wrong? Something serious? What are you currently doing? What do you preach? I preach God. In whom you do not believe. This I could never understand. I'll explain later. You are unbearable. Surely you didn't notice that it started? What started? I'm going to give birth. I curse this baby! "Giving birth"? You told me nothing. I was told ten days ago. And then the trip Otherwise I would not have come. Where are you going? I'll be back soon. A midwife. I need money! The revolver... I'll sell it. We'll have everything you need. No,I do not want anything! I prefer to die! How dare you set fire without my permission? - Who? We? Yes, you! I have exact information. But it is a pure lie! I know everything you do. Four days ago you indoctrinated a worker. I only whispered a few words in his ear. How can you know? I was hiding under the table. You, before yesterday, in your room, you pinched your wife Yes or no? Listen to me. Let's be clear. Right now, You must blindly obey Central Committee. Especially now. The fire is part of the revolutionary practice. What dissatisfaction do you have? In your insubordination. Enough! We will be denounced. All of us. Tonight or tomorrow. That's what I wanted to tell you. Yes. We wil be denounced. I have been informed. It's Stavrogin certainly. "Stavrogi n"? Why? It's Shatov, of course. Who else? The governor released him. It is not by chance, nor by goodness of heart. Are you sure? How do you know? I cannot tell you how I know. What can we do? There is only one thing to do. Send him to hell! It's me, Shatov. Who's there? It's me, Shatov. My wife is in labor. Come. My wife is in labor. Come. I will pay you. I give you my revolver. It is worth the money. Take it. Quick, please! Hold on! Wait outside. I'll get dressed Killing Shatov? I'm against it. I protest against this bloody decision. But...? What "but"? You said,"but". I'm waiting. I think I did not say" but " If we take this decision , then... What? His wife is back She is giving birth. He insanely happy. How could he denounce us? You know whom this child is? From Stavrogin. I'm afraid of dying Get out I do not want you... Go away It hurts! It hurts! Get out! No. Where are you going? Go out. Outdoors. Both of you. Go! You are not easy to please, lady. It might give him ideas. I do not mean he imagines anything. If he was not in love with you He would not run home with his tongue hanging out. My poor Lisa. What have you done? And why are you so worried? Is it the idea that women abandon you first? There is nothing that can hurt your pride. Poor Lisa. Why did you come? I'm a lady. I grew up in the opera. Who's there? - This is Nicolas. I need to talk to you. Only two words. - You want to know something. The culprit is me. You're a widower. None of us is guilty of anything. This is just a coincidence But you're untouchable. Burned down? Slaughtered. Killed. But the body is not burned. Fedka has not completed his work. Who died? You were listening? Maurice died? No. My wife and brother. An unfortunate accident. Is he telling the truth? No. He is lying. No. He was with you. It is beyond suspicion. This is not true. I knew what was coming. But Lisa, calm down! Maurice is waitign under the rain. He will marry you. Lisa! Where are you going? He's there. Maurice! No, not at home. I want to see the body. I want to see the body. Stepan! It's you? It's really you? Lisa... Lisa! Darling! dear... Can it be you in such a fog? You see the fire? Are you unhappy? No, Shut up! We are all unhappy. We must forgive them all. Forgive, Lisa. You must forgive. Rise. I kneel to say farewell to the world. Through you, I bid farewell to my past. Have you heard about these people we killed? I ran out of their delusions, feverish sleep. I go in search of Russia. Does Russia exist? Take my umbrella. Nobody saw me going. I slipped incognito. My dear Lisa, You told me that apparently, someone was killed? Come quickly. Stepan, wait! Give me you cross. Maybe you ought to tie But I prefer the cross Mauritius Give this child his umbrella. Your Excellency... This is terrible! - I arrested them all. Every single one them! Your Excellency... No. I know who set the fire. This is the work of nihilists. "Destroy everything!" And this is the result. Your Excellency, you should go home. The woman on the roof, what is she doing? Pull it. It will fall. The fire is not in homes, it is in the mind. We must give up everything. everything. The appearance of a new being, This is a great and inexplicable mystery. Sometimes I begin to think that humanity is perfect. We live in total harmony. This feeling is undeniable, the feeling that lasts 5 seconds. And I think: "What good are children?" If humanity is perfect, he must cease to procreate. Does this happens to you often? Two, three times per week. Are you epileptic? No. It is a disease. It always starts like that. You think all is good. You've got to be No. I don't have time. Tomorrow we need to take him to the shelter. Why? We will keep him. I'm so happy. "Happy"? You are really funny. I will not take your money. Sit down. Do not stay standing. I feel something strange... Unexpected. You forgive me? Not even for a day, Mary I have stopped thinking about you. You're back home. It is almost incomprehensible. Why are you still don't believe in yourself? And think yourself unworthy of love? You loved me for two weeks. That's enough for me. Arrange these covers. No not like this. Lean toward me. Come. What I should we call him? Ivan. Like you. You thought I would give him any other name? Terrible? We will get to work, the three of us. The old delirium is over! I'll never abandon you. Come to me. Nicolas Stavrogin is a wretch. Who's there? Everything is arranged. Really? You only need to show us where he buried the machine. Okay. Good. Waiting for you. At this hour ? Before the sun rises. Really? I return. You're leaving me? NOW? I'll be right back. I will never leave you. Hurry. Erkel, have you ever been happy? Yes. I will not stay. I came to tell you. Why ? This assassination is a waste of time A frivolous manifestation of selfishness. It is contrary to my system. So I'm leaving. He will meet with them and warn Shatov. Are you are going to see Shatov? Do not worry. If I see he I will not tell him anything. Farewell. You should at least talk to him, try him. Such a man will never give up. Siberia is waiting for you! Tomorrow! It's here. At this very spot. Do you have a shovel? Don't be afraid. At this hour there is not a soul around. Mary No, that's not it. It's not that at all. Quiet! There! Pierre! Pierre! Are there other groups or are we alone? Pierre! Idiot. Why now? I knew it. I knew that we were alone. You killed Shatov? I told you, he would denounce us. You're lying! You killed him because he spat in the face. For this and for many other things. I'm sorry Shatov. Yes. Me too. You're in danger. I was going to shoot. I do not want us to part in hatred. You know, I have nothing against you personally. It is in the interest of the cause. You gave your word. You want to know the color of my blood. You're a cheat, a false spirit. I'm like you. But you will live, and I will die. I'm going to live. I am a coward. I am a scoundrel. I know it. You are a monkey. I despise you. Do you remember the words of Christ? Yes. "Today..." Yes... Thou shalt be with me in paradise." "In heaven." He died at the end of the day. There were no paradise, no resurrection. If the laws of nature have not spared such a person If they forced him to live a lie And die for a lie, Then isn't everything a lie? Then why to live? Answer me like a man. Yes. Why to live, then? I quite understand. If God is a lie, then we are free. You kill me to prove that you are free. And that God does not exist. But for that, you must kill yourself. Finally you understand. If you understood, everyone can understand. I'm the first to refused to invent God. I kill myself to prove freedom of man. But, who will know? They will all know. What is hidden will be known. Dictate this, and I'll sign it. "L, Alex Kirillov, declare..." Declare to whom? To no one. To everyone. To the whole world. "The world." Bravo. "L, Alex Kirillov, declare to the world..." But not the authorities. To hell with the authorities. I want to draw a head with the tongue hanging out Not in drawing. The tone is enough. Oh. The tone. Dictates the tone. "I declare to the world this morning in the park, " I killed Ivan Shatov "For betraying and denouncing the organization." That's all? I also want to insult them. Date and sign. I want to insult them. No. That's enough. You have not dated or signed it. I want to insult them! So write: "Long live the Republic." Okay. No. "Freedom, equality "Fraternity or death. "Wonderful This is perfect Wait, some more! I'll sign: "Kirilov, the nobleman. "Russian seminarian and citizen of the civilized world." But do you sign it? yes or no? This is perfect. This is perfect. Come! Right away... right away. I'll watch over you. Sleep. Yes. I am going to sleep. Very good. Lisa Listen! What is it? Pigs are crying. You remember this passage from the Gospel? Chapter 8, verse 32. Read me some more. "There was a herd of swine grazing " The demons begged Jesus allow them to enter into them. "He allowed them "Devils, came out of the man, and entered the swine. "The herd ran into the lake and drowned. Shepherds, seeing what had happened, ran and reported this in the city and in villages And people came out to see what happened. And when they came to Jesus They found the man from whom the demons had gone "Seated at Jesus's feet and dressed in white "And in his right mind "They were afraid " My friend this passage has always been a lesson for me But an idea came to me now Yes The demons that come out of the patient, Are the impurities. And the patient is Russia. But the impurities come out And enter into the swine. I mean in us, my son and others We are possessed. We are perishing. But the patient will recover. And he will sit at Jesus' feet. And Russia will be healed.
