Stop following me! I must be the top of the school! I've lost everything! (Student dormitory rule Slogans: Freedom, determination, calm, endurance) Pursue with persistence. Surpass yourself. Join the elite. Strengthen your determination. Pursue with persistence. Surpass yourself. Join the elite. Strengthen your determination. Pursue with persistence. Work hard for six years. Enjoy the fruit for the rest of your life. You're still very young. Maybe you don't understand what that means. You may ask... My friends are enjoying themselves, why should I study so hard? Here I want to remind you that the world we live in isn't fair. While the Hare was napping, the Tortoise kept running. You'll be the ones who reach the destination first. Tell me. You want to work hard first and have fun later or the other way round? I just want to be the top of the school! What's wrong with it?! Chun, behave yourself at the new school. Hm. Dad, we haven't played games together for ages! It's time for you to concentrate on your studies. My studies? Why would I spend three years studying something I can learn in three months? Look at this smart boy! Whose son is he? Listen. I believe you can do anything, if you set your mind on it, right? Chun, work hard. Study with the elites and you'll become an elite! Good day, Mr. Yeh. Good day, ma'am. Welcome to Edison High School. I'm Fang Yuan, the principal. Nice to meet you, ma'am. Yeh. You scored very high in the IQ section of the entrance exams. But don't forget that genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration. The 1 percent inspiration is the most important. Even more important than the 99 percent perspiration. It's the second half of that famous Edison quote. Chun. Such a clever boy! Please. Nevertheless, I firmly believe all children can be disciplined if the right method is applied. Chun, look. He's one of the world's top 100 CEOs. Is he a candidate for the Nobel Prize? Yes. They're our most outstanding alumni. Chun. Work hard! So your photo will be hung here one day. Okay? Note it down first. Then we're going to move on to the heart... Set the variables so they could be added to each other... According to a reliable inside source, the share prices are controlled by the local cliques... The firefly wakens, waken thou with me While others are still looking for the right direction, we've paved the way for our students. Now I'm sure you'll be very interested in learning about this system. Here we run a unique system that sends our students straight to Harvard. Harvard? Harvard University? Yeah. Every year, we recommend our best student to them. Then he'll go straight to Harvard. So you mean as long as I get the highest scores I won't have to waste time in senior high and go straight to Harvard? Yes. That sounds very nice! So... We shall reserve a place for you at the top of our charts! Come, let's get you enrolled first. Hi, I'm Yeh Chun. I'm a new transfer student. Class 5 is at the bottom in every subject! Ms. Chou will lose the bonus again! But we don't have to worry about her. She's different from us. She advocates the positive discipline. So she wouldn't care about something as vulgar as money, right? Hey, I heard Ms. Chou got a transfer student who has an extremely high IQ! So I think it's hard to predict the results of the next exams. Well, that student with a high IQ has to survive in this environment first. Or he won't make any difference. Right? Get down! It's the evening roll-call! What's happening? Hey, that's my cell! No cell phone is allowed in the dormitory. Sir, he's a new transfer student. The closet, the bookcase and the rack, all failed. Ten points off. Another ten points off for reading comic books. You three. You didn't tell the transfer student the rules of the dormitory. Ten points off each. You lost 64 points in total. You're fined community service for six days. But... How did he know I was reading comic books? There is a camera in the room! You really got us into big trouble! Now we can't sleep for six nights! Okay, calm down, John! We'll lose more points if the dorm master hears you! Sorry, Yeh Chun. We should have told you the rules. Why should you apologize to him? He was being stupid! The rules are so unreasonable! There is nothing we can do. You'll get used to it. My name is Hsiang. He's John. That's Kuan-ting. We'll be held responsible collectively and get fined if we lose more than ten points. We'll lose half of our sleep time! Let me help you arrange your stuff. Then you just stick to it. Don't get us into trouble again. I thought all the lights were out? Why is there still light in Rm. 418? Because the best student lives in Rm. 418. Even the dorm master turns a blind eye on him. Who? Who's the best student? Wen in our class! Does anyone live in this room? Come on, clean it and back to bed! No time to be your tour guide! Hey, I often hear someone crying at night. Not the ghost student in Rm. 420, eh? So scary! Are you okay? Wanna take a rest in the bedroom? You deaf? Can't you hear the bell? What's your problem? Shut up, Chun! Get up and bring the textbook to the field. No need to brush my teeth? We'll lose points again if we're late! Surpass yourself. Join the elite. Strengthen your determination. Pursue with persistence. Surpass yourself. Join the elite. Excuse me. Excuse me! The results of last week's exams. No. 1 in 7th grade. Class 4. Awarded a break of two days. Last in 7th grade. Class 2. No weekend break. No. 1 in 8th grade. Class 3. Awarded a break of two days. Last in 8th grade. Class 1. No weekend break. No. 1 in 9th grade Class 4. Awarded a break of two days. Last in 9th grade. Class 5. No weekend break. In the weekly English test yesterday, Lin got 100 points. It's the rotten apples that dragged the average score down! The students in other classes can do it. Why can't you? When are you going to stop letting yourselves down? If you hear your name, come to the counseling room later. Chang Bing-wei, John Wang, Liu Ming-han, Wu Yao-jen, Tsai Lin-hui. (Washroom) Wen is here. Let's ask him. Wen! What formula is in this equation? How do you solve this equation? I've asked teacher, but... How to solve this equation? What formula is in this equation? Wen. We're going together, right? Come on! Wen! I have more questions! Thanks. No problem. So it's not easy to be the best student! You can't even go to the toilet! We should help our classmates. Why did you want to come to this school? Well... What's that sound? Firecracker! Firecracker? Hey. Hey, you. Why are we squatting? Where are you going? Let's go! Go! Go! Move! We'll leave you alone if you walk properly. Behave, okay? Shall we help him? In this school, grades decide your fate. If we lose our weekend because of bad grades, you become the punching bag. No one tells the teachers? You think they don't know? You got the lowest score again! Study harder! Where is your seat? You're at the bottom again. Go study with the ghost student in Rm. 420! If I were you, I would never leave my desk! You hear me? If you make us lose our holiday again, you would be murdered! IE 800! So nice to have a rich dad! Hao, your headphones are broken, eh? Borrow them from John! Right, thanks! So I can listen to the English text! Hey, what are you doing? Give it back to him! John lent the headphones to Hao. We didn't take them by force! Is that true? Right? Yes, give them back to me after the exam. See? Nosy snob! Let's go! Why are you so scared of them? It's okay. I'm used to it. Sir. Is this the right paper? Any problem? It's not for 9th graders! Yes, it is. It's your first day here? You really didn't cheat in the entrance exams? It's a math paper for 12th graders! I haven't learned it yet. It's a plain fact that you failed. Stop looking for excuses. No matter how high your IQ is, if you can't deliver the results, you're just a piece of junk. How can a teacher insult a student like this? Once you've entered this school, forget about morals, ethics and human rights. I don't care how good you are at playing tricks! Your grades mean everything in this place. So the best student has so many privileges? You don't have to turn the light off at night, and you even get a laptop and a cell phone. Yeah. I'm the candidate for Harvard. That's why I'm allowed a cell phone and a laptop so I can read academic papers at any time. Why did you take a textbook to the bathroom? The lights in our bedroom are out. But I need to study! The exams cover so much. Is that what you do here? Finish the courses years ahead? Yeah. In 7th grade, we did the courses for 7th and 8th grades. In 8th grade, we did 9th and 10th grades. In 10th, 11th and 12th grade, we'll do college courses. That's crazy! I just caught up with 10th grade material. Now I need to do the rest in the bathroom. You can come here if you want to study. The dorm master doesn't watch this room. No need! I don't want to enjoy your privilege for free. I'll fight for what I want! Why are you working so hard? And you? Why are you working so hard? You've shown me all the privileges you have. I'd be stupid if I don't work hard. I'll buy you a drink later. I'm off! There's no way to finish studying, right? We never accept transfer student because children who join us half way find it difficult to accept our teaching methods. But... Yeh is different. He is a born rebel. He knows very well how to improve himself. Only when he's put in a competitive environment can his ambition be stimulated. I should have sent him in earlier. Chun... has always been a smart boy. He's a very quick learner. Don't worry. He'll be transformed in no time. Ma'am. I'll leave Chun in your hands. Please give him the best education. Don't worry. Leave your child to us. We have very high expectations of him. He's got great potential. Louder! Lousy exam scores, and lousy energy! You're bound to be losers in life! Whoever's voice doesn't get hoarse, report to the counseling room later! Surpass yourself. Join the elite. Strengthen your determination. Pursue with persistence. Surpass yourself. Join the elite. Strengthen your determination. Study harder! It'll be your turn next time! Darn! You nearly scared me to death! I thought the dorm master found out I covered the camera! Knock before you come in. Is that a Simon Xue's song? You know him?! I grew up on vinyl records! My mom played Lo Ta-yo when I was in her womb. Really? Comrade! Cut it out! Look at the smile on your battered face! You'll learn it's hard to find a true friend here. I'm sorry. I haven't been very nice to you recently. It's fine and I know why. You can't survive if you don't act like that. Everyone fights flat out to be at the top. Is it really that important? Why are you... Why am I... Why am I so unambitious? The teachers pester me about that every day. But I don't care. I don't want to go to Harvard anyway. Well, you probably can't! I still have to try! My dad wants me to study medicine. So I can take over his clinic one day. But my goal is just to safely graduate from here. It's too difficult to become a doctor! Then what do you want to do in the future? Form a rock band! A rock band? Right. I risked my life smuggling it in. I was going to bring a guitar with me. But there is no place to hide it. They keep such a close eye on us. Today is an exception. Let me play a song for you. What do you want to do in the future? I want to go to Harvard! (Be studious, diligent and realistic) How did it go? I did my best. We just finished an exam. Shall we relax a bit? Relax? Look at what everyone is doing! We just finished an exam! That's what we do here. I want to relax and have some fresh air too! (9:00-10:20 Chinese 10:30-12:00 English 13:00-15:00 Math) Sir. Help! Something seems wrong with Wen. I went to Rm. 418 to ask him a question. He looked so sick. Let me see. It doesn't work. Not this one either. How are you feeling? Darn, they're so sick! Go check the monitors. Okay. Anything? Yes! Put the chairs back. Okay, go! Go! You okay? I feel much better now. Oh. Maybe I ate too fast earlier. I should be fine if I have an early night. Okay. If you still feel sick, you must tell me. Thank you, sir. Cheers! You're in 9th grade, and you never had a party in the dorm? How could it be possible? You think it's possible to have a party in a prison like this? Yeah. Chun. I've always wanted to ask you why did you come to this school? I can't wait to escape! Can't believe someone wants to come here. The last high school I went... The director of academic affairs was really annoying. So I replaced the picture of the school home page with a picture of him without his toupee. You're a hacker? No, that was really easy! You learned to do it in a minute. But you weren't good enough though. Or why did you get caught? Says who? I did so well that no one could pin it on me. But the teachers were so darn heartless. They just pinned the blame on a random student. I couldn't stand it and confessed. Wow! You're a hero! No wonder you got balls to mess with the dorm master's computer. What? The moment you walked into that control room, you all became my accomplices. No, no... If we get caught, we'll all say you're the mastermind. Yes! Where's your brotherhood! John, stop playing songs that no one has ever heard of! Play something popular, okay? Forget it, you have no taste. I don't want to play for you guys anymore! Hey... Have you ever thought where you would be when you're 45? I go first. I... I want to be a software engineer, write hacking software, and sell it to the governments as well as the terrorists. Make money from both sides. Nice, eh? I go first. I... I want to be a lawyer. Fight for justice and catch guys like you! Really? It's my turn! I want to form a band. Everyone will sing our songs. You mean like "Airport" by Simon Xue? Wen. You haven't said anything... I never thought about it. You just go to Harvard! What Harvard? The place at Harvard is mine! You dare to fight against me? Harvard? Childish! Stop messing around! I saved for six months to get it! Pass it down! (Lin Shih-wen's scores 58/92/98/96/98) (Answer sheet / Name: Lin Shih-wen) (School Rankings: Yeh Chun 120th) Come in. Miss, you want to speak with me? Sit. Although you're still at the top of the class, your average score is five points lower than last time. Five points? I thought it'd be lower. A lower score means you didn't work hard enough. You're still the candidate for Harvard. But if you don't work harder, you'll soon be replaced. Yes, miss, I'll keep it in mind. If you don't, I'll cancel all of your privileges. (I can help you only once.) I'm sorry, miss. Where are you going? Fugg off! Where are you going? Mothersucker! Nice to be beaten for the first time, eh? None of your business. Fugg! Let's treat your hands! Mothersucker! What the heck! Thought you were cool? Darn you! You loser! Wait and see if you lower the average score again! Idiot! Behave! Fugg! Fugg! Frustrated? Actually, I got beaten all the time when I was in 7th grade. Save the pep talk! If you want to get higher scores, I can teach you. Why? Aren't you worried you may lose your place at Harvard? Or you just think I'm no rival to you? Actually, I don't want to stay here. What? Straight to Harvard! Isn't it so nice? Hey. Can you punch me in the face? You lost your mind? No. I'm only joking. So... How to get high scores? What's this place? Such foul air! If you put your head through the noose, you'll be born again and start getting high scores. Did you lose your mind from studying too hard, and hang yourself here? I thought you've seen this! As long as you time it right, you won't put your life in danger. Try it! Or should I just... show you how to do it? You're crazy! Hey! Driver! Stop pushing me!! Since you lent me your headphones, this feast is on me! Come on, eat up! Another mouthful. Another mouthful! Eat, so your brain will grow! Didn't I tell you to eat? Eat your own kind! Eat up! No? Trash should eat trash! Fugg! Get over here! Darn! Eat more! So you'll have a bigger brain! Stuff yourself! It's so yummy. John. Why didn't you go home? I've got some work to do in school. Such a waste! I can't go home even if I want to. And you give it up just like that! You really want to go home? Of course! But I keep failing every exam. Do you believe I can help you improve? Really? Time for dinner! Being away for so many weeks, you must have missed Mommy's cooking. Come on! Chun. The principal says you've got great potential! Does that mean you can go straight to Harvard? They have a senior high at Harvard? No. If Chun's grades are good enough, he can skip grades and go straight to university. Going to the U.S. at such a young age? Well, I'll be worried. Look, he just went to a boarding school and hurt himself by falling down the stairs. I just want my son to be happy and healthy. Nothing else is important! Don't worry! Boys have to be independent. Right? Yeah. Don't worry about me. I'll definitely go to Harvard. Dad. If I become top of the school, can we go on a family trip? Of course! We can go to Boston. So we can visit Harvard University. Let's go to Boston then. Eat more! Forget it. On second thought, I love staying in school. If you keep getting such bad grades, you won't be allowed to go home until graduation! You sure I won't die? You're not talking to a dead body, are you? When was the last time you read a comic book, played a video game, and went to a concert? Chun, you okay? The water in the shower was too hot. I feel dizzy. Oh, okay. Ma'am. Ms. Chou is too soft on students. She lets them run wild. The class she teaches always gets the lowest score in English. And some parents complain that she insists on setting up the Fine Arts Club and encourages students to do things absolutely useless in their lives. Our evaluation shows that Ms. Chou is not qualified to teach here. Therefore I suggest that we should dismiss her. Let's give her another chance. Ms. Chou. If... The students in the Fine Arts Club get the best grades in the next monthly exams, I promise I'll annul your punishment and award you a regular bonus. Ok? (The best teacher is to set an example to students.) That's the answer. Darn! How dare you step on my foot! Be careful when you sit. Don't leave things that shouldn't be left on the path. You okay? Just look after yourself. Don't waste your energy on the others. You finished reviewing for the weekly test? It feels so nice, eh? So this is what it's like to stand at the top! No wonder you're addicted to it. Don't forget... what you promised me. Sure, I love keeping my promise... Listen. Is the paper really that difficult? Look, the highest score in my class is 88. That's ridiculous! 88 is high enough. Look. The highest score in my class is 83. The average score has gone down... the principal will summon us... What can we do? (Wang and Lin both get 100 points.) Wen. You got the highest score in the school. How did you do that? If I don't work harder, you'll be fired. Actually, it's not that hard to get high scores as long as you're brave enough. How did you cheat in the exam? Have you heard of "presumption of innocence"? Since you've got no proof, how can you suspect that I cheated? The average score of the class is 78. You aren't good enough to get such a high score. It's not that hard to get high scores, you just need determination. I raised the average score of the class. You don't praise me but question me like this. That hurts me. Shouldn't you feel happy that I help you keep your bonus this week? I can see that a lot of pressure is put on you. Stop finding fault with me. I'll always get top scores from now. I'm the only one who can help you. I hope you can do me a favor too. That idiot must have given up so he handed in his paper early. When the results come out, let's teach him a lesson. Sure! Idiot! What a freaking question in the paper! It was so difficult! Yeah. I've no idea what it was about. I feel the teacher is messing with us. It was really difficult. And that idiot handed in his paper early! Yeah. Right, he didn't answer any questions. He just wrote down his name. What the heck! Fugg! You okay? Fugg! Fugg! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door, you dirtbag! Fugg! You okay? Open the door! You okay? Open the door! Open the door if you've got balls! I want my headphones back. You alright? Lin. What happened to your face? I fell down the stairs. You did very badly in the weekly exam. You all got much lower scores. But I would like to praise one of you. Wang got 100 points. He sets an example for you. As long as you're determined, you can improve. Liu. Change seats with Wang. Why? Because you only got 68 points. Come to the counseling room after the class. This is not my paper! It's not mine either, is it? Piss off! If you hear your name on the list, come to the counseling room after the class. Liu Ming-han, Wu Chun-lin. Although there are still some rotten apples, thanks to Lin and Wang, our class is at the top of the school. Jui, what are you doing? I get bad grades just because you stay in the same room with me! Trash belongs to the trash site! Don't help him! Come in! Jui! Jui! What a change of luck! Did you do it? What? Did you swap Hao's paper with yours? You have too much imagination. It's not a good thing. Time really flies! I remember that three years ago, you, as parents, chose to send your children to Edison High School. Now, it's time to see the results. We've decided that we'll announce those who can stay on for the next three years, and the candidate for Harvard next month. Supervised by the most dedicated teacher Ms. Chou, the students in Class 5 have been performing better and better in the exams. Although there are still a few students who need to put in more effort, I firmly believe that as long as you keep working until the very end, you'll realize your dream. We never give up on any children. The future generation is our hope. All parents want their children to be successful. I believe that under the guidance of our staff, every child will soar and march towards success. Okay, next Ms. Chou will show us the progress the children have made. Why do Wang's and Lin's grades go up and down like this? Especially Wang. He is doing worse and worse this week. If you kept a close eye on him, this would never happen! In fact, I knew that the certificate you submitted with your job application was a forgery. The reason I was still willing to hire you was because I believed that you would be a great teacher. I hope that you won't prove me wrong. Why couldn't I see the answers in the exams this week? I don't know! As you said, I hang myself in Rm. 420 before the exam. But I'm doing worse and worse. The effect weakens with time. You don't seem to be weakened! Everyone's different! I think it's related to talent and intelligence! Still refuse to tell me? Tell me if you don't want to die! Any other secrets hidden in Rm. 420? I really don't know. Offering! Get someone to hang himself in Rm. 420. Why? You have to find someone, and make him hang himself, so you can keep the power. You should tell me such an important thing earlier! Using me as an offering, I'll make you pay for it later. What happened? This shouldn't be here. It's not mine! If it was mine, I wouldn't put my name on it! It was planted. Fine. Then let's take turns stamping on it! Chang. Chan. Not like that! Stamp on it hard! 10 points off for a banned item. Rm. 406 is fined community service. Since Wang reported it, he's exempt. John! What the heck is your problem? Your arrogance really pisses me off. Beat me if you're any good. Don't you think John has changed a lot? Really? I remember their personalities always change a lot when they become the top student of the school. I think maybe they study so hard that they've gone mad. Maybe John was bullied for so long, now he has the chance to take his anger out on others. But Wen doesn't bully his classmates! I remember when he was in 7th grade, he was quite outgoing. Now he feels a bit too quiet. Hey, you're right! I remember he loved drawing so much that he kept drawing secretly in class. He even joined the Fine Arts Club. Then he gave up drawing and focused on studying, and became the top student in the class. When was that? Maybe when we were in 8th grade? It was in the second semester! When the top student Mao jumped off the building. Really? I thought Wen was already the top student before Mao jumped. Yeah? I can't remember... Chun. Help me! How come you fell down the stairs again? If this goes on, John will kill me. How can I help you? Kill John? Hang yourself in Rm. 420. Only you can save me now. Stop him by becoming the top student! I promised you! I'll get top scores! But I'll never hang myself in Rm. 420! Please, I beg you. Aren't we friends? Please, save me. Wake up! Here, it's impossible to rank first only by studying hard. Nothing is impossible in the world. Hey! Didn't you promise me you'd persuade Chun? But he refused! The exams are coming. But you failed your mission. What should we do? Such a cool watch! A present you got for being top of the class, eh? I wonder if it's heat resistant? Let's experiment! Get over here! Get over here! The exams are coming. Write my name on your paper, and I'll write yours on mine. Don't you dare play any tricks, or you will be dead meat! Chun. Help! I don't want to die. Help! Wen! (John writes down Wen's name on the answer sheet.) (Lin Shih-wen's score: 18 points) Please don't worry. Ma'am, please look after Wen. Yes, it's our duty. I'll have a word with him at home. Your father is very concerned with your school work, he really cares about you. Go home and rest this weekend. After you've adjusted yourself, come back and work hard again, okay? Dad. Can I transfer to another school? I get beaten every day. I become the target because of the grades and the ranking. I... I really can't take it any more... Get out of the car! What? Get out of the car! Dad, please don't be like this! I don't have such a weak son! I'm sorry. I'm wrong. I was only joking. I'm sorry. Dad... Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Louder! Louder! Louder! Heads up! Pursue with persistence. Surpass yourself. Join the elite. Why do you always fall down the stairs? Come on, let's go! Can we not go in there? Please, let's not go in there. I beg you. Don't worry. I won't let John get away with it. I'll help you. Wen. Today I'm very pleased because some of you did so well that you're awarded the blue certificate of merit, a symbol of honor. I hope that they have set an example for the rest of you. Regard them as targets and encourage yourself to win your own certificate! Agree? Why did we make the certificate of merit blue? Because blue is the color of Edison High School. It's like the sky. Vast and boundless. Moreover, blue symbolizes your beautiful future. Blue represents freedom. Work hard for six years. Enjoy the fruit for the rest of your life. You're still very young. Maybe you don't understand what that means. You may ask... My friends are enjoying themselves, why should I study so hard? Wen. Because some are born Hares. Wen. Some are born Tortoises. Wen. Don't cry. Wen. In this case, it's fair. When the Hare was napping, the Tortoise kept running. You'll be the ones who reach the destination first. Tell me. You want to work hard and have fun later or the other way round? Okay. Page 99. Question 3. Where is Lin? Sir! Lin... Something happened! Come help! What? Stay in your seats! What happened? Excuse me. Hey! Mr. Yang. Don't touch him. Don't touch him! You call the police. I'll find the dorm master! Ms. Chou. Don't touch him! Just watch him! Don't touch him! Fugg! I asked the other students just now... Wen! What on earth have I done to my son? Miss Chou, I seem to have forgotten how to draw. Finally, I put my talent to good use in my studies. Let us have a minute of silence for Lin Shih-Wen Lin was the top student in the school. Not only did he do well in his studies, he was a good friend to everyone. I feel as sad as you all about the tragedy. But in this moment of distress, I remind you all that you shouldn't indulge in grieving. You have to study even harder, and face the world with your chin up. John! What the heck! Turn yourself in! Nonsense! I know everything! You forced Wen to kill himself. You think you're smart? You think you know what really happened? Wen's laptop is there. Hack it and watch what's on camera. That's the first day I went into Rm. 420. Propanol, acetone, isopropanol, acetic acid and butane. Which has the highest boiling point? Acetic acid. Why can some plants keep the fluid in the cells flowing in low temperatures? Because of the high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids. In the Islamic world after the 19th century... Hey, stop. I feel invincible! Since I've helped you improve, you have to keep your promise. Sure, what promise? Cut me! I'm not into this. Then punch me in the face. What's wrong with you? Come on! You promised me! Harder! You're so weak! You sure? Again! Again! What's wrong with him? Wen wanted to transfer to a new school. He thought if he got bullied in school, his father would agree. You thought I was happy when I hit him? I didn't want to do that! I know how it feels to be bullied. Wen promised me that as long as I helped him transfer, he'd return a favor. What favor? Help me get you! Miss Chou, I want to seek revenge for Wen's death. Will you help me? Come in. Another bad news. Yesterday Wang fell down the stairs and injured his head. He had to stay home and rest for a while. So we need to choose a new candidate for Harvard. Director of academic affairs, please show us the rankings of the students in 9th grade. Okay. Mao is dead. So is Wen. If we follow the adults' orders like idiots, (87 is a pun on "idiot" in Mandarin.) You'll be the next one to die. Blue is the color of freedom? Where is our freedom? Let's tear down this evil school! We want true freedom! And a sky where we can soar freely! Wow, so many teachers! Trying to scare me to death? Ms. Chou, this is typical of your students! You didn't follow the school's policy and that's why you had so many problems in your class! Yeh Chun. You were expelled from the last school because you hacked into its IT system, right? So what? Because this morning our IT system had been hacked. So I'd like you to be our consultant. The hacker was very smart. He planted a lot of red herrings to conceal his identity. Moreover, he wiped the traces so clean that even our IT teacher failed to find anything. If even the IT teacher can't find anything, I'm afraid I can't help you, ma'am. The hacker was extremely smart. But don't forget that you're bound to leave your footprint. The IT teacher found that he might have an accomplice. Ms. Chou. Can you explain why you logged into the system at 4:57 this morning? Ms. Chou. Don't be so nervous, relax! I'm sure it wasn't you! But before we catch the criminal, you're the prime suspect. After what you've done... First of all, you'll be fired. Then you'll be sued, because hacking and forgery are serious crimes. Because hacking and forgery are serious crimes. Once you have a criminal record, you won't find any job in the future. Your life will be ruined. And you'll be in serious trouble! Ma'am. Yeh is the hacker. Last night Yeh came to me, saying that he wanted to disrupt the school and seek revenge for Lin's death. So he logged into the system on my computer. He has a USB drive hidden in his tie. Yes, I did it! I did everything! I don't want to stay here anyways! You adults are dirty, despicable, shameless and hypocritical! Go to hell, all of you! Yeh Chun broke the rules in a very serious manner. He disrupted the whole school. I do want to help him. But I really can't find any reason to do that. Hypocrite! Ma'am. We'll pay for all the damages done to the school. Please, don't expel Chun. Ma'am, I remember you saying that you wouldn't give up on any children. Chun certainly made a mistake this time. But I hope you can give him another chance. Don't give up on him so easily. Don't beg her! Actually, I really like Yeh Chun. But if I have to make an exception to keep him, I need to find something really convincing, you know? Please, ma'am. He's the only son I have. Please don't ruin his future. My wife nearly died when she gave birth to my son. I fought flat out to save them both. Understood. I think the only way is... If he gets the highest scores in the next monthly exams, I'll forgive his misbehavior. Thank you, ma'am. But if he fails, I'll expel him immediately. And, I'll take him to court. Hacking and bodily harm are serious crimes. Bodily harm? What do you mean bodily harm? I'm sure Yeh Chun knows what I'm talking about. That's it. This way, please. Sweetie. It doesn't matter if you get the highest scores or not. When this semester is over, we can still go on a family trip to Boston.
