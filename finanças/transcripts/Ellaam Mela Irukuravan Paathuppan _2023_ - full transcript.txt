Hello, one by one, please. -Sir, what is the ideology... ...behind this building technology? How did it all start? Imagination is stronger than knowledge. Every citizen in this country aspire to have their own house. To fulfil their wishes, we had to destroy nature... ...to build houses for them. I looked for a way to protect... ...our soil and nature. 'Without Sand Technology'... ...is the way forward. -Sir, what would you like... ...to tell the aspiring youngsters? When you have power, use it for the poor. That was what my parents told me. -Excuse me, sir. Hey, you! Hey? -Hey, you! Can't you hear? Hey, get up! -Wake him up, sir! How long are we to wake you up? -How can you sleep... ...when you're here for an interview? Don't you have manners? How long am I to call you? Please go in now. -Was that a dream? Sleepyhead! Dream is not something that happens when you are asleep. Dreams prevent you from sleeping. The dream expert said so. He misunderstood the dream expert and kept on dreaming. He is a typical VIP too. His name is Raguvaran. Everyone calls him Ragu. Look, Mr. Ragu, I don't want to bother you with routine... ...and mundane questions. Okay? Can you define soil reinforcement, please? It is to reinforce soil. When soil is reinforced,... ...it stabilises weak soil. -Excuse me! Can you repeat that in English? I can understand, sir. But I can't speak fluently in English. Give me a chance to speak in Ta.... -See, Mr. Ragu,... ...we need a person who speaks very fluent English. Because all our clients are from abroad. Okay? Better luck next time and all the best. Sir, I obtained 96 percent. -You might be a brilliant student. I don't deny that. But we need someone who speaks very fluent English. Okay? Sir, please. -No more discussion. You may go now. Why do such people come to the office and trouble us? Ragu, I bet you didn't get this job too. I have another interview tomorrow. I'm sure I will..... It's okay if you don't pay me the rent arrears. Please take your stuff and leave. Brother, where is Ganapathy Mess? Must you eat there? No one can help you. Go straight and turn left. There will be a dead end,... ...the restaurant is beside it. Understand? Go on? I wanted to eat well today. -What can I do if the food is bad? I blame you. -Waiter! Come here! What is it? -The kurma is spoilt, it stinks. Does it stink? I don't think so. -Really? Try some. How is it? -It's great. Don't get him wrong for handling the situation tactfully. We say our taste buds are dead. His nose and taste buds are dead. He can't smell or taste. He is Vasudevan. Come on, let's meet the next character. We don't need this. Tell us what you have. No, tell us what you have for us to eat. Are you shocked he is making kottu parotha in his mouth? He stammers for hours even when you ask him his name. If a customer asks him what is fresh in the kitchen,... ...the customers will storm out in anger before he tells them. It's great if he can string 2 words together. His name is Thirunavukarasu. I don't think the Cauvery issue is ever going to get solved. Boss! -Yes, Mani? I have an unpaid salary. When will you pay me? Right, your salary.... Mani, get that for me. It's over there. He does this every day. Here you go. -You wanted to say something. What is it? -Did I want to say something? Yes. Look, you forgot. -Boss, I forgot. Here. Put this too. Go and do your work. We'll talk in the evening. His name is Mani. He is very forgetful. If you give him a job while he is doing something else,... ...he'll forget what he was doing earlier. Thank God he is not married yet. This man of expression is the restaurant owner. His name is Ganapathy. If he has 3 unusual characters to work for him,... ...it's because he is fated. Do you call this coffee? -Don't you like it? There is no sugar in it. How can I like it? Call the man who made this coffee, I want to see him. Looks like a problem is brewing. -Wait, he'll come out. Master! The coffee you made is lousy. A customer complained. -What does he want? Can't he shut up and drink? Wait, I'm coming. I forgot to introduce an important character. The man who looks like Yamma in plain clothes is Aravinth Samy. The man who toils in front of the stove holds the rein... ...of the restaurant. He only looks like a cook. If anyone complains about his food, he becomes a stunt master. What? Are you upset your coffee has no sugar? I only said the coffee has no sugar. Hey, it's not coffee, it's tea. -Tea? But it still needs sugar. You diabetic! -Who is a diabetic? Hey, go! Get out! -How dare you touch Raja! I'll show you who I am. -I'll dice you and make bajji. The fight ended too soon. -Shut up! Owner, if you let him in again, you get nothing to eat. Brother! Brother Aravinth Samy! -Who is that? Ragu, what are you doing here? -Brother, I came to see you. Okay, come in. Ganapathy Mess 100% Vegetarian You need a place to stay, right? -Yes. There is a room upstairs. All the dogs are living there. You're like by brother. Will I say no to you? You can stay in the room. Who is going to question me? Let's at least tell the owner..... -Owner? Owner, is it okay with you? -If you agree,... ...I won't say no. Okay! -Good. It's my restaurant. Let's see who dares to question me. -It's as if you will listen. If anyone questions me, I'll grind them. Move. Tend to the customers. -There are no costumers. Someone new has come. And he is educated. If we let him in, we'll be in trouble. Right? It's us against him. Is the new person your friend? -Fool! Who are you? -Brother Aravinth Samy said... ...I can stay here. -Is that so? It's not this room, but that one. Go there, you can't come here. Brother, your leg is bandaged. What happened? It's nothing, I sprained it. -I thought you got bashed... ...while demonstrating. The whole town knows you have no sense of smell. Why are you pretending? -I just sniffed. Do you have no sense of smell? At least I'm okay. Ghajini has a memory problem. At least I'm okay. But Thiruna..... Stop. All of us here have different problems. Boss, do you booze? -Once in a while..... Why do you hesitate to say that? -Pour some for me. Here you go. -Thanks, brother. It is still early. The bar will still be open. Go and buy a bottle and drink it, okay? We'll have this Funny guy! I'm very drunk today. I can feel it. Good night. Sweet dreams. -Brother! Why is Brother Aravinth Samy helping you so much? We are from the same town. He knows my problem. We are here too because of Brother Aravinth Samy. He is a kind man, but hot-tempered. That's when we get irritated. What can we do? We are happy today because of him. This restaurant is still open because of him. We can't find a job anywhere else. This restaurant is our world. Am I right? -Right. Brother, have you eaten? -No, I haven't. Go and eat then. -Enough, today, file is closed. Finish. My cigarette is missing. Who are you? You shouldn't come here. Why do you want to hit me? -What would one do to a thief? Mister, who are you calling me a thief? I'm the restaurant owner's only son. Your name? -Karuna. Sorry, sir. Please don't tell me to vacate. No, I won't. Go on. We need someone with good English proficiency. Sorry, Mr. Ragu. -Sorry, mister. Better luck next time. -Your English isn't up to the mark. You are not the candidate we are looking for. English is just a language, it's not knowledge. Then, learn the language. -Just give me one chance. Please. God bless. Who is here? Fighting? This auto man is waiting. Cut! Take okay! Move to the side. Can't you hear? Apple juice, two. -Sir, you were great. This scene is over. I'll call you when I've ready for the next scene. Sir, your punch was great today. And your hairstyle was superb. Check if the door is locked. -Sir? Sir, I've locked it. -Aren't you afraid anymore? Remove it! It feels so great. Sir, why don't you go for hair implantation? Do you think I don't know? It won't suit me. And besides, I'm afraid of surgery. If I go for a hair implant, how will you make ends meet? Sorry, sir. Besides your father, only you know this matter. If this news leaks..... -Even if I die,... ...I won't tell anyone. -If you tell, you won't just die. You will lose everything. Sir, shot ready. Put on the wig. Hurry! Ragu, what happened to the interview? It was as usual. -Forget it. Brother! Is the restaurant owner's son's name Karuna? Yes. Why are you asking? -No, I just wanted to know. It's a long story. Karuna was the owner's only son. He was very brilliant. When he was in Year 5, he got an award from Mr. Abdul Kalam. He wanted to be a scientist just like Mr. Kalam. So, he was always in his room doing research. His room was his world. The owner and his wife were proud to have a son like him. But we don't know who jinxed it, Karuna went missing one day. He was nowhere to be found. After a while, he returned. But he was not like before. He lamented and screamed all of a sudden. He wiggled often as if he was in trance. If anyone asked him any questions, he'd hurled whatever he got. We tried many remedies to cure him, but nothing worked. The owner's wife was bedridden in the hospital... ...as she got depressed looking at her only son. The boss had to borrow to treat his wife. Then Karuna went missing again. We thought he would come back again like before. But he didn't come back. The owner's wife... ...got too depressed as she was pining for her son. She passed away. He didn't even come back to do the last rite. The boss lost his family, now he is all alone. The restaurant was doing well at one time. Now business is badly affected. 6 months after, we found another shocking truth in the papers. Karuna, the boss' son, was hit by a train and died. Did he die? -Yes, he died. Padmini said his spirit is still here. Did you see anything? -No, brother. The town is not safe anymore. So, be careful. Spirit, ghost, devil, I'm not afraid of them. Because I did not drink my mother's milk,... ...I had ghost milk. Cut it! Superb! Okay! -Okay! Thank God it's a dream. Hey, Ragu, it's Shenbha. -Why are you calling at this hour? My shoot just ended. Forget it. You have an interview in the morning. Okay? Ragu..... -Stay on the line for a minute. Sure. Shenbha, can you hear me? -Ragu, are you there? I'm asking if you are there. -Yes. I can't hear you. Can you hear me? I can hear you. -There is an interview... ...at a friend's company tomorrow. I've recommended you. Be there at sharp 9. -Sure, at 9, right? Yes, 9 o'clock. -Text the address to me. No, I'll pick you up in the morning. Be ready, okay? -Hello! What is this? I can see without my glasses. Hello, Ragu, I'm here. -Okay, coming. Will this interview be in Tamil or English? Don't worry, I've told my friend. They will speak to you in Tamil. Okay? I'm late. Bye. -Hey, all the best. Do well. -Sure. Okay, let's start the interview. -Yes, sir. What are the steps in concrete processing? Explain, please. She said he will ask in Tamil, but he is asking in English. Right or wrong, I'll say what I know. Mr. Ragu! One, patching. Two, mixing. Three, transportation of concrete. Four, compaction and curing. These are the major steps in concrete processing. Well done, young man. Our HR will call and give you further details. Okay, sir. -Welcome aboard. Thank you so much, sir. Ragu, you are going to live your whole life in your dream. Ganapathy Mess Here you go, boss. -You wanted to say something. What is it? -Me? I forgot, boss. Sorry. -Oh, no! I'm lucky I found a worker like you. Come closer. Here. Let me put this too. Go and do your work. -See you, boss. Are you asking for your salary? -Hold this. Mani, what's wrong with you? You were a thug. I feel bad seeing you like this. -It's my fate. What to do? Who is he? -He was a big thug at one time. You won't understand if I tell you. Let's go. A thug? Hey! Were you a thug? -That was before, I'm not anymore. Go and do your work. Hello. -Hello! Am I speaking to Mr. Raguvaran? -Yes. This is Anita calling from Fathima Builders. Congrats, Mr. Raguvaran. This is to inform you... ...that you were selected during the interview. And when are you planning to join us? Did I come for the interview? -Aren't you Shenbha's friend,... ...Raguvaran? Yes, sorry. -It's okay. How soon can you join us? -I'll join this week. Good. I'll mail your appointment order, salary and further details. When you come, bring your original certificates... ...and ID proof. Have a nice day. Okay. -Bye. Thank you. If the interview was not a dream..... Hello, Shenbha. -Thank you very much, Ragu. Thanks? What did I do? -If you were not here,... ...I wouldn't be alive now. Thanks for rescuing me. But how did you get there..... -Madam, sir is calling. Okay, Ragu, I'll call you back. Bye! I saved Shenbha's life. I went for the interview. I got a job. But I can't remember anything. How did this happen? I'm confused. I can only see everything in my dream. You shouldn't come here. -He was hit by a train... ...and died. Let's start the interview. I'm so confused. My head feels like bursting. Thanks, Shenbha. Go home carefully. -Don't forget to give me a treat. Sure. -Bye. Oh, no! -The girl has fallen. Help! Help! Help! Hey, Shenbha! -What are you doing here? You have an interview. Go! -It's okay, I'll get your scooter. Wait, I'll send you home. -Go, I'll take care. What are the steps? -One, patching. Transportation of concrete. -Well done, young man. So, did this cause the change in me? This is going to change my life hereafter. The sky is in my hands... The world is in my pocket... Many magic flowers bloom... They spread graphics... Time listens to me... There is speed in me... Youth is bustling in me... I'm ever so eager... I see new scenes... I love this world for the first time... My legs move at the sound of speed... I move like Sonic... I can stop time... I am reborn as a super hero... I'm the super hero... I'm the super hero... I'm the super hero... I'm the super hero... Today is not like yesterday... Everything has changed... Time crawls like snail... I just love it... My dream has become a reality... My leg does not stop me, they are my rockets... There are many languages in this world... But I was hiding... It can't be anyone else... My fate has changed... I didn't expect this... I am not worried anymore... God will handle it for me... I'm the super hero... I'm the super hero... I'm the super hero... I'm the super hero... I'm the super hero... I'm the super hero... I'm the super hero... I'm the super hero... What is Aravinth Samy thinking? He keeps scolding me. What if I stitch my hankie? Why does he bother? I'm going to fix him one day. Hello! Who are you? I don't understand what you're saying. Put the phone down. Why is the big boss sleeping? -Dude, look at him. He is in peace. Shall we booze? -Great idea. Where to look for money? -Why ask me? Don't you have money? -Me? As if you collect your salary. Look, he is sleeping like a log after a good meal. Thiruna, he has a wallet. -Come on. Be careful, you may pull something else out. Wait. What is this? Pickles? Come on. Hey, what is this? Hey! Hey, come on! -What's wrong with you? Your sister's husband! What is this? He is a pain in the neck! Who are you? I don't know what you're saying. What is he saying? -I don't know. Hey! What is happening? -Beats me! Give me that. Now talk. He stammers, but now he is talking in so many languages. Hold that. Mani! Why is it so smelly? Have I been using this? Boss, you can smell. -Right. Give me that. In 500 BC, I was riding a horse to China. Were you a stable boy? -No, I was Damu. Which Damu? -Bodhi Dharman. What are you looking? -This is Nokku Varmam. Why are you looking at my face? Give me that. Hey, don't! Don't pull! Don't pull, Karuna! Give it to me. Let go! -Give it to me! Give! -Do you think I won't cuss? I still remember foul words. Don't push! Don't go around in circles. Don't! It shouldn't be in the hands of humans. It's too dangerous for us. Go and bring it back. Or destroy it. Go now. Hey! Is he out of his mind? I don't understand. Sorry, it wasn't intentional. We felt different when we touched it. Something happened to us. So, we started tugging..... Sorry, brother. Everything in my life happened in my dream. Only now, my dream has become reality. You destroyed everything. You wouldn't understand my feelings if I tell you. There wasn't a day I wanted to hear me speak. You told us about your dreams and feelings. It's the same for us. I didn't have any sense of smell for a long time. But now, I can smell. It's because of this. Everyone around me, from my boss to my friends,... ...have been cheating me because of my poor memory. They are still going to cheat me. But with this, no one can cheat me. All along, I was selfish. I wanted a good life, I wanted only my weaknesses fixed. I didn't think about you guys. When this was in one piece, I could see very well and move fast. But now, it is broken. Now, only my sight is good. As long as it is with us, we won't know our weaknesses. Let's face life happily. Let's keep this carefully. Don't tell anyone about it. Dhal is ready. -Good morning, Aravinth. Have a nice day. Is it really him? How is he able to talk? Did he stay up and practice the whole night? What did they say about my star? Shock? -I left it in here. What are you looking for, brother? -The coffee powder is missing. I'm looking for it. -You took the yellow bag... ...to the shop yesterday. Look in the right bag. You're so forgetful. -How did he know? What is happening here? I'm confused. Brother Aravinth Samy, good news. -What is it? I found a job. It's a big company. All of you are springing surprises on me. That is not important. The gas is leaking. Are you a cook? God, they come daily. What can I get you? -Karuna, check on the customer. The owner is here. Let me see what he does today. When can I get my salary? -Salary? Can you pick that up for me? Do you want your salary? You can drop it as many times as you want,... ...but I still want my salary Rs50,500. I'm surprised he still remembers. Boss, a rose in rose water smells good, right? Rose water? Rose? Can you smell? It's French. You understand, right? Write this date down in your diary. -Oh, no! Thiruna can talk. Boss, they have changed. They are different now. Our restaurant is going to change too, just watch. Come on, guys. Get the vehicle, we'll go to the restaurant nearby. They said they are going to change the restaurant,... ...but they have gone out instead of working. Oh, it's this creep. What am I going to tell him today? Ganapathy. -I'm M. Ganapathy. You can't pay the money you borrowed,... ...but you can emphasise your initial. Why don't you answer when we call? It's because..... -What? Do you have an excuse? No, I'll pay you. -How will you pay? Oh, no! -Can I take over this restaurant? I'll pay you back. -Who wants to take this restaurant? I'll cook all of you. Can't he keep quiet? -Who is he? I don't know. -I'm the cook here. Didn't your father name you? -You'll get scared... ...if you hear my name. -Try me. Why are you laughing? I'll smack you. How dare! Ganapathy, I wanted to give you 7 days. After how he spoke, I'll give you 3 days. If you don't pay up by then, the restaurant is mine. His body will be sent to you. Pick him up. Oh, no! Let him go! I'll pay you soon. -Pay up soon. The countdown starts. I borrowed Rs10 lakhs from him for my wife's treatment. After adding all the interest, now he says I owe him Rs20 lakhs. Despite spending so much, I couldn't help my wife. My son has left me too. Aravinth Samy was by my side... ...when I had no one to turn to. He might be hot-tempered, but he's a gem. He came to my defense, and now, he's in danger. If you give me some time, I'll go back and sell this restaurant. We'll pay the man and rescue Aravinth Samy. Until then, look after my restaurant. Goodbye. I am angry with Aravinth Samy,... ...but to think that he's in trouble, I feel sorry for him. He's the worst cook, but a good soul. Boss wants to sell this restaurant to rescue him. I don't know what we are going to do. The four of us will go and smack Raajali,... ...rescue Aravinth Samy and redeem the restaurant. How does this sound? -What do you know about Raajali? Are you showing your power at the station? You're making a mistake, Raajali. -The inspector is getting angry. You took money from me. You were afraid when you took the money. How come there are no feelings when it is time to pay back? I heard you threatened my boys when they came to ask for money. I had a financial problem. -So what? Watch your words, Raajali. Are you trying to threaten me? I'm a cop, I hope you know that. -It seems he's a cop. Are we threatening him? -No, brother. I'm going to threaten you now. Just watch. Don't, you're making a grave mistake. I want my money back in 7 days. Or I'll abduct your wife. You can't do anything to me, Not only you,... ...no one can do anything to me. Let's go. Not long after that, there was news in the paper that the SI... ...committed suicide, but it was murder. Raajali killed the SI because he did not pay him on time. The SI is not his only victim, he has killed many people... ...who defaulted. So, I'm saying,... ...if we mess with him, he'll kill us. So, what do we do? We need money. Where do we get the money from? And we need Rs20 lakhs. I have an idea. -What is it? I know where he has hidden his black money. I know the place. -How do you know? I was working with him before I join this restaurant. Hey! So, you were a thug before? A terrible thug. If they were going to kill someone, I had to be there. Without me, Raajali won't do anything. Mani! -Yes, boss? It's time. -Okay, sure. Colour? Purple. -Purple. Yes. -Hey, where? Inside. Tell me. Yes, we can do that. Boss! I'm the best in the field. Why did you hit me? -I thought you killed people. Were you a procurer? -So what if I am one? How did you lose your job? -There was a job. If you say that again, I'll punch your mouth. Boss, if he keeps hitting, I won't tell you anything. How did you lose your job? -Keep quiet! Tell me where the money is. -We went to a hotel... ...for the usual matter one night. Vanakkam. -Keep it! He received an alert notification. He didn't even realise I was in the car, he drove off. He went to a government hospital. He got down and hurried off to the mortuary. Everything is here. Why did I get an alert? Boss, why have you kept your money here? How did you come here? -I followed you. Is that so? Get that bear bottle. Why did we come here? -I don't know, boss. We are here all of a sudden. -Why are you carrying... ...a bear bottle? -It was here. I don't know why I picked it up. -Let me see. As usual, he diverted me and took me out. Let's go. -If we take the money,... ...we can rescue Aravinth Samy and the restaurant. I've decided, we don't have a choice but to take the money. If we plan it correctly, we can take the money. Brother, isn't that wrong? If Raajali can charge exorbitant interest,... ...turn it into black money and hide it in a government premise... ...without the government's knowledge,... ...then it's okay to steal his money and pay his debt. But it's not that easy. -I'll handle it. But for that, I need someone's help. Hello. This is the matter. -So, you are going to rob. But how can I help you? -If we want to rob... ...without getting caught, Raajali's phone... ...must be switched off when we are doing so. For that, we need someone. If the girl is someone unknown to us, she may double-cross us. So, the girl must be someone we know. The plan is great, but who do we know? We can pull this off if you help us. Don't worry, it's not you. You must make Padmini,... ...our colleague, look younger with your makeup. Padmini, this is risky. Are you sure? If you can take a risk for Aravinth Samy, won't I do it? Hi, darling. I'm on the way. Have a peg, I'll be there before you finish it. Bye. Hey, we must be careful. Don't do anything to botch it. The doctor is calling you. Go on. Nothing will go wrong, right? -You're dead, shut up. I'm feeling dizzy, push slowly. -Doctor! Please check on my father. Hey, fool, I'm a nurse. He is a doctor. Doctor, please come and check on my father. Oh, no! -What's the problem? My father wanted a pant. So, I got one for him. When he was fastening the zip, it got stuck. Are we stuck? -Won't he use underwear? He is not used to it. -That's tough. He must first learn to use underwear, then use a pant. When will she come? -She will be here in 5 minutes. Will you switch off his phone on time? You guys know nothing, I'll do it. Padmini, be careful. -Concern? Now, the zip is stuck. We have to cut it out. What are you saying? -Doctor, the body is missing. What? Where is it? Look for it. The body can wait. Remove the zip first. Where are you? -That's not my department. Another doctor will handle this. -Why aren't you saying? Talk. Nurse, what about you? -I only work with female patients. There is no one to help my father. I am very scared. What's your plan this week? -Doctor, shall I cut his head open? Wait! Have you eaten? Where is your wife? Doctor! -What is it? This is an emergency. Do it quickly. I'll do it after this case. -Doctor, shall I cut open the head? Do it. Where are you? -In the mortuary. Mortuary? -The man is so eager... ...to cut the head. I'm the next case. Come fast. -Don't worry, I'm coming. He's here. -Who are you? What are you doing here? -Doctor, we came to help you. Put him here. -Don't kill me. Lift him. Who will remove this? Why throw it on my face? Don't booze and doze off. -What's next? I'll cut his head open. -What? Wait! What are you doing? -I want to cut his head open. Fool, remove his clothes first. -I'll do it. Drunkard, not your clothes. Nurse, remove his clothes. Doctor, help her. Naughty, I told my staff to undress the body, baby. Thiruna, just lie down quietly. Where is my tool? Control yourself Look at this. -You come here. Wait, I know, I'll do it. Here. -What were you guys doing? They almost broke my skull. -They would have done a lot more. I'm a virgin. I could not take it when I lady touched me. Get down. The number you are calling is switched off..... He has switched off his phone as planned. The alert won't go off. You can start now. Look there. -This is the one, boss. Mani, give me the password. -Password? What is that? What? You can't open it without the password. I only saw the money, I didn't see the password. Why didn't you tell us earlier? -You didn't ask. What if we had asked? -I would have said I do not have... ...the password. What's happening? -Forget it, don't yell. Forget it. Boss, I have an idea. There is a wedge and a hammer outside. Let's use that to break open. Hurry, I'll break your head. -Don't joke, guys. If we do that, we'll end up in prison. You need a password to open this. Or the alarm will go off... ...and we will all be caught. You ruin it. -There goes! Can't we get the money then? -Let me think. Try to recall. -You have the cube with you. Try it. Mani, you would have seen him pressing the password. I wanted to give you 7 days. In another 7 days..... I wanted to give you 7 days. Yes! Hurry! Hold. -There is money... ...in a place meant for bodies. -Only one letter... ...is different between panam (money) and ponam (body). I love it! Boss, take all the money. Raajali may be a thief, but I'm a good man. Let's go. How can you let all the money go? -Don't change like a politician... ...when you see money. Let's go. Why do you talk like an angel? Brother! -Is this the time to knock? Don't you have sense? -The guys from Ganapathy Mess... ...have brought the money. -Brother, we have the money. Please check. Let Aravinth Samy..... -How did you get this much? A kind soul like you helped us. Brother, Aravinth Samy..... -You've paid me. I'll send him back. -Hey, let the dog go. Okay. -Give then back their document. Okay, brother. -Darling, wait. Hey! I want her back tomorrow. -Okay. Don't just stand there. Go on! What happened to him? He won't reuse. What did she do? She must be good. Brother, welcome. How are you? Use this. -Superb! Superb, boss. Brother! What happened? -I'm not Aravinth Samy hereafter. I'm Amaithi (peace) Samy. Drop me at the bus stop... ...along the way. I'm not well physically and mentally. I want to visit temples for some time. I'll come back later. Bye. -Okay. Bye. -Take care. Keep an eye on our boss. -Sure. Dude, I've never seen Aravinth Samy so quiet. They must have done something to him. Boss, I have a doubt. When Raajali turns on his phone,... ...he'll get an alert. Will we get caught? No, he would have switched on his phone by now. He would have got an alert. And he'll be wondering what went wrong. Then he'll rush to the mortuary. He'll get angry when he sees his money missing. Where is my money? But he won't know it's us. -How do you know? Because he is not as intelligent as he looks. He is a fool. -He was your boss. That's how he would be. How did you lose your job? -I thought Raajali's wife... ...is that sort of a woman, I sent her to his room. He gave me the sack. -You sent his wife to him. You're a great procurer. -I will not forget his wife. Thank God he is not married. -Hey! Hey, you're okay, right? He is a fool. He was your boss. That's how he would be. Who came here? What did he look like? He looked new, but very good looking, boss. Say that again. -He looked good, boss. Boss! -Yes, boss? Boss! You took my money to pay me back! None of you will leave this place alive. Aren't you afraid? You can't live if you're afraid. Come on! Hey! What was the hurry? You're the one who said we can't live if we are afraid. Get up. Hey! Go! -Boss! Hey! -Mani! Get up! Throw the iron rod. Why did you hit him on the head? -You told me to hit him. I told you to throw it at me. Did I tell you to hit his head? No one saw this. Get into the vehicle. Let's go! Luckily no one saw us. Raajali has many enemies. One of them killed him. We didn't do this. Okay? Vasu! -Boss? Call our boss and tell him Aravinth Samy is safe. Tell him to come back only after he hears from us. Tell Padmini not to come to the restaurant. Okay? Until then, we should not be here. Do you understand? We won't get caught, right? -Hereafter, it's not in our hands. Only God can help us. Oh, no! Boss, another murder? What are you saying? -Hey, shut up! Boss! The only son of the hotel owner. He was hit and killed in a train accident. What are you looking, boss? Who is this? Do you know him? He's our boss' son. -Our boss' son? He doesn't look like his father at all. I thought he got hit by a train and died. Is it him? -We have never seen him. When did you see him? How do you know? They are here. We must save the human race. Boss, he's not dead, he's still alive. Yes, boss. Boss, what do we do with him? -They are here. Pick him up. -Hold him. This is Earth, right? Are you human? -No, this is Yamaloka (hell). I'm Lord Yama, he is Chitragupta and he is the buffalo. Hey! -We are talking about frying you... ...in a jar. -Mister! Don't babble if you... ...don't know what is happening. -Who is babbling? Answer us. Did I see you or not? Do you speak as a living being or are you a spirit? We are confused. I am very clear about what you are confused about. I will prove to you that I am very clear... ...and clear up your confusion. Until then, it's okay if you're not clear, just don't get confused. He is confusing us. Get some water. Hey, he is back to his senses. -The water is for me. Here. Hey, where is the quantum? Tell me, I have a lot to do with that one thing. Do a lot with one thing? -Where is this? You don't know the quantum's value. -Which condom is it? It's not that I've never seen it. -Buffalo! That's not a condom,... ...but quantum. -What does it mean? Immeasurable power, if compressed onto something... ...or a place, that's called quantum. Oh! That? All right. -Do you understand? Yes. You know what I'm talking about. Tell me. Where is the quantum cube? Tell me! We don't have time. We are at a critical stage. Tell me! I can't tell you. We have lots of problems. Everything changed after we found the cube. I'm not that good a person to hand the cube over to you. Me too. You will die. Not only you, he, this guy, me, all of us will die. Please, try to understand. -How will this kill us? So, did you create the cube to kill everyone? I didn't create it. I flicked it from the aliens. Aliens? Not only that, the world is in great danger. Only if I return the cube, I can save this world. Say where it is. -Yeah, right! The world is in danger and he will supposedly save it. He must be crazy. Who's crazy? Am I crazy? Tell me! -No, I'm crazy. No, I'm crazy. Oh, God! He is confusing me. Everyone made me crazy. -Who, sir? The aliens. -Alien? Who is he? The research the aliens did on me caused the change in my body. I heard all this only happens in developed countries like America. Does this happen in our country too? This is happening in our country and around the world. Hey, why is the dog barking? -It's a new dog, sir. I think it is not comfortable in the new place. Do something to shut the dog up. What can I do? -What? The dog is very fierce. It bit the watchman. I'm afraid to go near the dog, sir. Okay, pour me a peg. Sir, don't get angry. Tomorrow is a very important day. So control your intake, sir. -Check if we have any ice cubes. I'll check. None, sir. -Go and get some. He'll keep talking. These shorts are comfortable. Have fun. What is this? It looks different. Could it be an imported dog? Jimmy! What do you want? Do you want some? Or do you want some mixture? Do you eat chicken? Chicken lollipops? Why are you lifting your feet? Stand properly or it may hurt. I feel like I've seen you before. Where did I see you? There is a lot about aliens on Google. If I say this as proof, no one will believe me. So, if I want to tell others what happened to me... ...or prove that I'm not crazy, I need proper evidence. When I was trying to gather evidence,... ...one day, the aliens kidnapped me again. The figure I saw in the specimen container... ...looked like a human. As a man of science, I had to find the answers... ...for the questions in me, that kept me searching. I realised the aliens were targeting Earth for a reason. When I heard a sudden sound, I quickly ran and hid. My hand accidentally touched something,... ...there is a change in the energy pillar. My instinct told me that it is something important. It is proof as well. So, I took it and left. I saw something unbelievable through the window over there. I saw a few aliens taking a baby out from the stomach of a woman. That's not a human baby. It was an alien-human hybrid. I realised that this was the reason the aliens were targeting Earth. If this happens, no human can live on this earth in the future. Luckily, the aliens sent me back to Earth... ...without realising the cube was with me. I began studying the cube immediately. But the next day..... I tried to get away from them, but I realise I couldn't. So I threw the quantum to you to save it. So, you gave me the cube? But why don't I remember anything? Again, brilliant question. Whenever they come to Earth,... ...they don't want anyone to find out about them,... ...they crash all the electronics in the area. And if someone still sees them on Earth,... ...with advanced neurological technology,... ...they create an artificial flash and erase the memory... ...of the person to the extent necessary. Do they erase our memory? -But with the recordings... ...of my hypnosis therapy, I found out everything that happened. But the last time they kidnapped me,... ... they didn't do any research on me. They were lookin for something in me. It must be the cube. They need the cube badly. They didn't erase my memory... ...because they want the cube. As what the cops do. They let go of an accused and go after them... ...and arrest them again with evidence. You are smart. -Yes, I know that very well. Yes, but when they think they don't need me,... ...they will erase my memory completely. Based on what you said, we are in a critical situation. Hey, give me that. Here. Here. -Why are they in pieces? Did you break it? Why is he stammering? -That's another story. I'll tell you later. Someone is knocking on the shutter. Could it be the alien? You wait here, we'll go and check. What shall we do now? Mani, go in and hide. Attack when I say, go on. Thiruna, you go over there. Me? -Go boldly. Should I? -Open the door first. They came in a group. Hey! That's Raajali's wife! -So, this isn't them? Oh, no! -Vasu, what happened? Hey! I'm so angry I feel like cutting you up! My husband used to roam around like a lion. You beat him until he went crazy. I will not let you go! Hey! Who said we hit your husband? Your husband has many enemies. Let Raajali say... ...that we hit him, then you can touch my boys. Release them and get out! -Let my husband's memory recover. If he says you hit him,... ...no matter where you are in the world,... ...I will drag you and cut you in front of my husband. Only then, my anger will subside! Hey, come on! So, isn't Raajali dead? Sir, good morning. Are you awake? So, you used an alarm to wake up? Is this a watch you bought online? Hey, he's here. Where did you go, sir? We were afraid when you went missing. Sir, don't go anywhere without telling us. I got so scared. This involves many production companies and dates. And who will answer your fans? Sit down, sir. You need to get up early in the morning. Please sleep, sir. I will come in the morning. Good night, sir. He is drunk. Don't open the door if he knocks. Okay? There are many appointments in the morning. I'll come and see him tomorrow. Get ready, sir. Everyone is waiting for you outside. Go take a shower. Sir, the bathroom is over here. What's wrong with him? Why are you walking this way? What happened? Who came just now? -Let it be. I'll tell you later. Boss, who is this man? Why are we here? Scientist, please return his piece to him. Hey! Tell us about the cube. We have to do some important work right now. First, we must find a place to hide this cube. We can't hide it in any usual place. Because the radiation from this cube will reveal its location. Two, before the alien finds us, we must find the alien. You said the alien takes human form when it comes to Earth. What if he has taken the form of a human? Yes, he is right. There is a certain smell for all living things on this earth. The smell of sweat on humans, the smell of animals,... ...it is different for every living thing. The aliens have a peculiar smell too. The smell..... I get the smell. It's coming from that door. The aliens have arrived! Oh, my God! -Sir, she is my school friend. So, she's not an alien? But there is this smell. Mister, what are you doing? This is it. The alien smells the same. What is this? -Pine flower. Pine flower. -Ragu, what is going on here? Why is the restaurant in this condition? How about the thing you guys did? -I'll tell you about it later. Why is your face hurt? -I will explain later. I want you to go now. Today is my boss' birthday. I came to take you with me. It's okay. I'll go now, goodbye. Yes, this is the smell. We can find the alien with this smell. Great! Vasu has the ability to smell from far away... ...if the cube is in his hand. So, we'll find the alien in no time at all. I will copy this cube and hide it. You find out who the alien is. Until then, keep this cube safely. Okay, who are you? Do you have any problem? Why tell us all this? What will the alien do now? Calm down! Be patient! Sir, happy birthday. Sir, you can see that later. Wave at them now. Sir, that's enough. Your schedule today,... ...at 9, you will light the lamp and cut the cake... ...at the fan club. At 10, you will distribute Android phones to orphans. At 1, on the occasion of your birthday, you will fly the flag... ...and start a blood donation campaign organised by your fans. At 3, you will inaugurate the jewelry shop with the heroine. We'll shoot in the evening. We can go home after that. Let's go, sir. -Happy birthday. Vasu, we trust your nose more than you. Please use that properly. Of course, boss. I will do it. -Try it once. Okay. I smell everything, boss. Just focus on the scent of pine flowers. Okay? Okay, boss. -Thiruna, get into the vehicle. We are counting on your nose. Come on. The smell of pine flowers. Dude, they are boozing. -Hey, stay focused. Hey, great! I get the smell of bonda. Hey, if you find the alien, I'll buy you a cookie. Hey! Hey, we'll buy anything you ask for,... ...just look for the alien. -Okay. Hey, stop! The smell is strong here! -This is a flower market,... ...of course, you'll get all the fragrance here. Mani, let's go. This will not work. -Why did you bring me here? Sir, all the schedules are over. It's 2 o'clock. Where are we going? You've been looking at the watch since this morning. What do you see in it? Hey, drive. -I am driving. What is this? Mom! Dad! I must get out of here. Only this all the time? Nothing more? You can have more today. -Hey! Ghost! I told you to do gardening, what are you doing? Who are you? How did you get in? Fool! Where are you going? Boss, there's a call. -Check who it is. Hello? -Ragu, is Vasu there? It's Vasu. What is it, Shenbha? -You wanted to take a photo... ...with your hero. But I got you a chance to act with him. When? -Today. The shoot is this afternoon, don't forget to come. Okay, I'm coming. -Okay, bye. Boss! My life's goal will come true soon. Let's go, boss. Hey, come on! What are you talking about? -I'm meeting my idol, Rajeshkanth. We are in a big mess,... ...you're being so irresponsible, you want to meet an actor. Which is more important, to find the alien or meet your hero? Meeting my hero is important to me. -Hey! What? No, boss. What if the alien we are looking for is on the set? You tell me, we've been looking since this morning. We haven't checked over there. What if the alien is there? Our work will become easy. What do you think? You tell me. -Let's go and check. Can we go? Sir, next is a song sequence. The director said you don't need... ...this watch. Can I remove it? Give it to me, trust me, I'll keep an eye on it, sir. I'll take good care of it. Okay. Sir, I will keep an eye on it. They are calling you. Go on. He is coming, please be quiet. He will come now. He is here. -I can't believe I'm seeing him. He is the president of the Kaasimedu fan club. Give me the baby. Sir, please give my boy a good name. I have a son. What a name! What is this? Madam, here. Your son will be like Jackie Chan. Boss, thank you. -Gopal, that's enough. Come on. Long live the leader! -Your movie will be a hit. Sir, your costume is ready. Let's go. Boss, I can smell an alien here. Boss, it's coming from over here. Come on! Come on! Oh, no! Oh, no! Will he hit me? What am I to do? They have arranged pine flowers all over. I got a little confused. Forgive me. You've been sending us in circles the past two days. Boss, what happened? -As usual, false alarm. Hi, Ragu! Hey, hurry, put on your makeup. Makeup? What for? I look good already. Brother, put makeup on him and give him his costume. Hurry. Do you want tea or coffee? -I don't want anything. What happened? Why do you look dull? It's as if you are looking for something that you lost. It's nothing. I know you are hiding something from me. It's okay if you don't want to tell me. Shenbha! What is this, Ragu? Is this true? It's true. -What if we get into trouble? We are in a big mess now. We are trying to solve it. What? -Hello! Hello, Ragu, I have the copy ready. Come here immediately. I'm coming. Hey, come on! Bring Vasu with you. We'll go first. Sir, in the story, you're the king of the forest. The svayamvara is for you. Girls from all the villages dance and sing. You don't like anyone. But when Sunny Meon, with her beautiful waist..... What? -It's a mosquito, sir. I will kill you! When Sunny shakes her beautiful waist,... ...you fall for her. -Is it a sprain? Fool! What is this? -We can't do anything. Do your work. Go in, don't stand here. Sir! Take him in. -Sir, you can see her later,... ...she's not going anywhere. Ready! Song! Action! If such a situation arises, we will take care of it. This is the new dog. He doesn't know me. Jimmy! Mommy! Don't! Cut! The shot is okay! He is coming. Everyone, stand in line. Wait, sir. Your fans are waiting to take a selfie with you. You need them if you want to start a party. Got it? Go. Miss, come on. Come on. Enough, go on. -Go! Go on. Go fast! Go on! -Go! What's that smell? -Hurry! Come on! Boss! -That's enough. Hurry. -The smell is coming from here. Watch? He has seen me! He is looking here! He found me! This is our last chance. But we haven't found out who the alien is. I found out who the alien is. It's my idol, Rajeshkanth. He is the alien. So, is he not the real Rajeshkanth? No. -No. What do you mean, Shenbha? He is not the real Rajeshkanth? No, there is a secret that only the two of us know. What's the secret? -He has no hair. He is bald. As usual, after the shoot, I went to remove his wig. But I couldn't remove it. His hair looked natural. I tried but I couldn't remove it. That's when I suspected that he had a hair implant. Sir, hair implants..... But there is no chance of that. Then I just left it. But I am sure, it is not Rajeshkanth. I wonder what the alien did to my leader? There is no time to talk now, Vasu. Hurry, we'll go to the place. Mani, go straight. Here it is! Stop! I'm telling you to stop here, where are you going? Why is this mask so bad? -Mister, I did this myself. That's how it will be. -Stay there, Shenbha. Signal us if someone comes. Where did you drop it? -When I was getting away... ...from the alien, the cube fell here. Here? Let me check. Yes, this is where the sea and drain meet. Because there are pollutants here, biogas is produced. The biogas is heavier and denser than the surrounding atmosphere,... ...it has the power to store heat and radiation inside. Therefore, the simplest of signal reception, for example,... ...the signal on your phone jams and there won't be a network. So, the signal from the cube did not show on the alien's gadget. Is that why it kept tapping its watch? Exactly. -Science, in an English film,... ...after Arnold fell into the mud,... ...the beast could not see him. Is this the same? Yes. Now we know who the alien is... ...and we found a place to hide the cube. Nice! So, can we easily fool the alien? -It's not that easy, Thiruna. Firstly, the alien should not find us. We must get the gadget that is on its hand. Is that all? We'll use Shenbha to get the gadget. No, Ragu. If something goes wrong, Shenbha's life will be in danger. Let me think. What are you saying? I don't understand anything. We were speaking in an alien language. When I was on the spaceship, I remembered two or three words... ...the aliens spoke. I tried saying those words. I checked if Thiruna knew their language. He knows the alien's language too because of the cube. Not bad! -So, I have a plan. Come closer. The alien is here looking for one cube. Only we know that it broke into four. So, we'll use the 3 cubes to confuse the alien... ...and get its gadget. -Oh, no! What are you doing here? I'm asking you what you are doing here. Who are you? You don't look like our people. Don't you know that ordinary people can't speak our language? I know that, but I can't trust you. There is a problem with your gadget. That is why you can't identify me. Does the item we are looking for show in four places in your gadget? You are right. There are indeed four signals. That is why you missed the man you found. Because of your carelessness, our people are angry with you. Finally, I want to say something as a friend. I'll come and get you after I fix this. Give me that. Until then, don't do anything. It was hard for me to convince the alien. I almost died. -Good job! Boss, what's our next step? We'll hand over the alien to the police, boss. If we do that, will the police believe Rajeshkanth is an alien? They will label us as fools just like him. We'll think of another idea. Let's fix the alien up with a lady. -Hey, I'll smack you! Where do we look for a female alien? I mean murder. -Hey! Murder? That's a sin. He is right. If the alien knows... ...you stole this gadget, it will find you and kill you. Hey, a scientist should save lives and not kill. Yes, we will kill the alien. What is this? You're also saying you want to kill. Do you want to end up in jail? For us, we are going to kill an alien. For the rest, we are going to kill a big star called Rajeshkanth. The whole country will talk about it. An investigation will begin. During the autopsy,... ...they will know we did not kill Rajeshkanth, but an alien. Everyone will know when they see the body. But they will look for the real Rajeshkanth, right? That's right. That's not our job, the police will do it. This is the only way to prove the existence of aliens... ...and save our cube. -But, Ragu..... Shenbha, there is no other way. Please, bring Rajeshkanth to the place we tell you. That's enough. All right. Because of your carelessness, we lost the cube. That's a big mistake. You must be punished accordingly. This will be a lesson to others. Before humans study and know everything about the cube,... ...we must get it back. Or it's a risk to our kind. Come, sir. I somehow brought the alien here, you take care of it. Come, sir, join us. What do I do with this? -What are you asking? Just take it and drink it. That's all. Boss, for you. Boss! Shall I pour? Sir! Your drink. Success! -It drank. Yes! -One! Two! Three! Four! Five! This poison will not harm me. And I also know why you're doing this. Not me, sir. No matter what you try, you won't get the cyber cube. I will help you get the cube. -Why do you want to help us? We are from Planet Nibiru. Our planet is experiencing a lack of natural resources,... ...especially gold. So, we went to many planets looking for gold. We found an abundance of it on one planet. That is your planet, Earth. Life on Earth at that time did not know the value of gold. We made use of the situation. We chose you, animals, through DNA restructuring,... ...and gave you the ability to think and turned you into human. You were loyal and honest to us. You also worshipped us. Before we returned to our planet,... ...because we liked you so much,... ...we gave you a lot more knowledge. Even though we left your planet, we were watching you... ...from our planet. You made unexpected progress with the intelligence we gave you. Your nuclear weapons freaked us out. So, the new leader of our nation... ...wanted to control and eliminate you. We are trying to create a developed nation... ...with a hybrid of our race and your race. If that hybrid race lives on Earth, your people will get destroyed... ...by itself. We kidnapped many people from your race and did research. One of them stole our cyber cube which is a powerful tool. If it is in human hands, the human race will be... ...the most powerful race in the universe. So, we're here to stop that and take the cyber cube back. I'm not interested in wiping out the human race. We must protect the nation we created. That is why I want to help. Tell me where you kept the gadget and cyber cube. I'll teach you how to hide and use them. Are you using sentiment to get the cube from us? It won't work here. -I can take that away easily. However, I want to help me. But you must help me. I want to live with you. I live like a slave in my world. If I want to live freely the way I like,... ...I must live here. You must help me. I want to live here. Believe me. I can prevent the danger you are about to face. I have your gadget. We believe you. Where is the cyber cube? Here you go. Sorry, they accidentally broke it. Great, boss. My husband has forgotten the past. He doesn't know who am I. Is Raajali an alien too? Hold this. Hold this. Tell us what they are saying. At the end of Transformers,... ...the hero robot and the evil robot... ...discussed, am I right? That's how they are discussing. Hey, come on! Let's catch him. Hey, Shenbha! Save him! -Okay. Shenbha, take him away. Hurry! Let me go! -Please, boss, do not hit him. Pity him, don't hit him, boss. -That's not your boss, move! Quiet! Boss, please! -Move! Let go! Hey, let him go! Ragu, catch! If you take one of the four original parts... ...and attach it to this duplicate cube,... ...a signal will be emitted. It will show on their gadget. We will lose one and save three. Ragu, give me your hand! Ragu, get in quick! What is happening? Why are our clothes in this condition? Oh, God! Shut up! -At least you tell me. The alien is after us, boss! Drive faster! Ragu, fast! It's close, boss! Why did the car pass us? -It isn't chasing us,... ...it's after the other alien. What about Shenbha? Hey, what do you want? -Sir! Shenbha, are you okay? -I'm fine. If I want to live freely as I wish,... ...I must live here. You must help me. I wish to live here. The alien wanted to live with us, but it's gone now. Poor thing! Boss! -You want to know who, right? Get lost! -Why are you laughing? I'll tell you, come with me. Sir! You appeared like God. I'm running to call you. Why are you not dressed? I have your clothes and wig. Good, let me have it. -Quick, get in. Without them, no one recognises me. -Get in, fast. What is this, Shenbha? -The director told me... ...to use this for the next shoot. -Do we have a shoot? Yes. -Is that why you're so excited? Yes, sir. What happened to you? That's a long story. I'll tell you later. What is this spray for? -You're smelly, sir. Let's go. -Pine flower. Great, Shenbha. -So, my hero went with the alien. Why did you do this? What will happen to Tamil Nadu? Chill. He is not an angel. Great, right? We planned and tricked the aliens. I don't think the aliens were fooled. I doubt it. What am I doing? -Who are they? What are we doing here? Who are they? They are not dressed. Hey, who are you? Where are you taking me? Tell me! Hey! Do you know who I am?
