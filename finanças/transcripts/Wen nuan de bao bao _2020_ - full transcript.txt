My name is Bao Bao, I've been spending my whole life cleaning, washing, tidying, sorting, planning. And scheduling. In the past 27 years, 6 months and 21 days, I have made 80301 plans for myself, and fulfilled them all in time. I teach children to play the piano. But in others' eyes, I'm like a monster. Everyone hates me. Here, class begins. Even my students don't like me either. His students didn't show up for class again. No one wants to take his class. I mean, what is he doing here? Something's wrong with him. Just stay for an hour, whether the students come or not. I can't even stand hugging people, for the countless germs on the skin. Hugging is not hygienic. Anyway, I haven't been hugged, and I don't know what it feels like. Every night, I will sit on the balcony, watching the people at the next building. I also want to chat with friends, or cook a dinner with loved ones. If only there's someone who would talk to me. Could you talk to me? Sorry, I don't understand what you're talking about. Sometimes I really want to stop all of these. Stop cleaning, stop sorting, and stop planning, and just be a normal person. So that my life can be less lonely. But I can't handle it. Today, I'm gonna put an end to all of these, by making the last plan for myself. Hello, is this the cremation service? I'd like to know, what is needed to go through procedures of the cremation? It requires the valid identity documents... and a portrait of the deceased. What is your relationship to the deceased? I am the deceased himself. Hello. I had ordered a funeral car. I want to double check the order. Please come to the Starting Point Instrument Center, and pick up the body at 6 pm this afternoon. Please come on time. Besides, the message in the funeral wreath must be in Simsun typeface. Thanks. Finally, it comes to an end. The girl's name is Song Wennuan. I didn't even know her 2 hours ago. And I could never know that... she would be the one... who spoil my plan. Ohhh my god Ohh my hair, can't get dirty. Using my core muscle to stop from falling into water. Yes, she did. The first accident in my life. What a lousy rider！ Don't you see I am here? Oh, hell! See? You've destroyed my motorcycle. I am telling you, you must make up for me. Don't you touch my stuffs.

There is no way for you to die. My plan... is spoiled. Come on. I saved you, not hurt you. And you're feeling wronged? Why did you save me? So I made a mistake? Go to die, then. I should be dead according to the plan. I can not die again. But you are alive now. That is because you saved me. So I made a mistake anyway? Die as you wish, quickly. I should be dead according to the plan. I can not die again. But you are not dead now. That is because you saved me. So I still made a mistake? Go to... Stop. Can we stop going on like this. It is a loop. Let's start in another way. Now that you are not dead, you should live well. That's because you saved me. Can you stop saying this? Can't you live your life well? You choose to die just because no one likes you? How vulnerable you are. Besides, how do you know no one likes you? Check it yourself. Check the commentary subtitles on the video. The contestant was me, why did you mess around? Now people are all giving credit to you. That should be me. So many people fancy you now, what can death bring you? You got lucky now.

Thanks My balloon Mom Mom Where's my towel? Leave me a five stars rating, please. Eat slowly, there's still plenty of meat. Let go. Make a choice between me and your mom. Xiao Zhou, stop. Hello Hey, sweetheart, Come in and take a seat. SPA. Oil SPA. Come on. What? Are you scared of me? No. I'm looking for Song Wennua. Upstairs. Too bad to be so pretty. Little tigers. Little tigers. Run so fast Run so fast Tell me where you are going. Tell me where you are going. Let me know. Let me know. Hey, Bao Bao, you're here OK, everyone. That's all for the class. Goodbye, Miss Song. What a surprise. A nice home. Here's not my home, It's my studio. So where is your home? This is my home. I was giving kids online class, to make some allowance. Come on in. Let's talk about the contest. Get in here. Come on. Make yourself at home. Well, here's what I think. If taking part in the competition, can get more people recognize me, and have people like me, Then I will go with you. You can rest assured. With my talent and your genius, we're gonna be celebrities for sure. You'll get so so many fans. They'll give you flowers, send you gifts. You'll be surrounded by fans whereever you go. At that time, people would cheer like, Bao Bao! Bao Bao! I love you! I love you! Really? OK, count me in. Great. Here's the deal. According to the schedule, the rematch will be held in the 5th next month. That means from now on, we'll have 20 days to prepare for it. 18 days. As we're such a dream team, reaching the final is for sure. And here's my plan for the final. Well, as a professional, I will be the lead singer, standing at front of the stage. You just need to stand behind me, playing the maracas. And playing the maracas is never easy. Rhythm is the key. You need to move your body, with its rhythm. What's wrong? Sorry, I can't hold it. Toilet is there, and there is toilet paper inside. Why are you wearing the gloves? It's my first time to your place. It is a little bit... I am sorry, but I really can't stand it. No, no, no. You can do it here. Please go to the bathroom. It's really making me uncomfortble. Please, let me sort these out. You don't neeed to clean there. Don't touch my cosmetics Clean elsewhere. Where is this place? It's your home. Who are you? I am Bao Bao. Hey, my lipstick. Don't mess around with my things. You should put it in this way. Just keep it there. Don't touch it. Give it back to me. Give it to me. Stop it. Sorry. Leave, now! Before I lose my temper. Get out! Director, check this out. It's the first time he comes to my home, and my place is cleaned upside down. Literally, everywhere. Look at the window, look at the table, look at the floor. Tidy and clean. Who can stand a person like him? I don't think I can team up with him any longer. Song Wennuan. I never expect that you'll find so many merits on him... to satisfy me, for you solo play. Now you got two choices. First, you two join the competition together. Second, he comes alone. I'll leave it to you. Sorry, it's my bad. I was too hard on you. Don't be mad. I am not being moody. It's just, according to the plan, there are still 10 seconds left before my leaving. Come on! We are not launching a rocket. But it's out of my control. Three. Two. One. Bro, can you stop being so rigid? Just for a sec? I would like to stop, too. But I can't. Well, can you slow it down then? No. My speed must be 7 miles per hour. So that I can get home right at 9 o'clock, for the evening news. You really need to work on you quirks. Otherwise, How could you go to the contest like that? If I could get over it, I wouldn't choose to kill myself at the very beginning. You can't be this way forever. Haven't you seen a psychologist? If you go on doing all of these, someday, you will drive yourself crazy. I had went to the psychologist. What did the doctor say? I drove the doctor crazy. I still think, you need to work on your issue. I'll introduce you to a friend of mine. Maybe he could help you. That's a deal. I'll leave you here, my meniscuses is killing me now. You've run for 5 miles. Today is the last day of your courses in the Comfort Center. Today, we will say goodbye to each other. You had memories here, maybe you'll also miss here. After this class, you should pay your bills. At this moment, I have to mention this man. Li Bo. He was an extraordinary psychologist, healed so many patients. However, he himself was driven mad by a patient. Anyway, He finally found himself back! Let's congratulate him with applause! Thank you. Thank you, doctor Jia. I am fine now. I am really fine. I find myself back. Thanks for doctor Jia. I am so back now. Hey, doctor Jia. Hey, Wennuan. Hello, doctor Li. What? Bao Bao. It's him. That's him who drove me mad! Why can't you leave me alone! Why can't I get away from you! Come here! Put him on the admission procedure! Give him another two courses. That's the doctor who went mad because of me. Made a patient out of a psychologist. You are really good. Seems like I need to take you seriously. Doctor Li's medical records, are full of his complaints to you. He wrote down every detail of... how you drove him crazy step by step. Everything in the world, happens for a reason and comes with a consequence. The consequence for you is your illness. But you need to tell me what is the reason, for your illness. Do you want to change or not? Well. I'll start with the story of my parents. At our age, we should not delay any longer... for the baby. I want the baby, too. But it's just... I don't think it's hygienic. I can't get over myself. Here, I've borrowed the videotape... from my colleague. We can watch the video, maybe it'll help us. Let's get started. The mating of animals is a selfish behavior. The male wish to spread his descendants all over the world The female wish for that too. The male and the female cooperate to create new lifes. No, no. I can't do it. It feels so unclean. Damn, how come I just can't make it? Congratulations! You've got a healthy baby! He is the very first successfu I test tube baby... in our city. Um, can you do me a favor? Would you clean him up, and disinfect him. Then put him into this bag? What? Are you packing up leftovers? Tips for Eliminating Germs Add three drop of Dettol antiseptic disinfectant into the water. Then place the mob into the diluted disinfectant. Are you ready? Yes. Let's make dumplings! The diameter is 5.5 cm. The radius is 2.75 cm. The girth fomula for a circle is, 2πR. So, the girth of the dumpling wrapper... is about 17.2787596 cm, which is a non-recurring decimal. The length of Bao's mouth is 3.43 cm, and the width is 2.25 cm. So his mouth can open up to 7.7175 cm² at most. Such a dumpling wrapper... Such a dumpling wrapper... at the girth of about 17.2787596 cm, after being stuffed, folded, shaped, is exactly the size to put into Bao's mouth of 7.7175 cm². Why do you bother so much? Just give up eating dumplings. You really have been ill for a long time. And so bad. To get you completely cured, would take some time. We have no time. The rematch is just in a few days. Can you come up with another way? Just get him ready for the rematch. Here's another plan, but I'll need your help. I'll prescribe you some medicine. Two pills a day. When should I take it? Whenever you want. No. I have to take the pills at a fixed time. I need to fit in my daily schedule. Well, Mr. Bao. Do you fart? Of course. Then take the pills when you fart. OK, I got it. I'll take the pills at 2 pm everyday. What the hell? You even planned when to fart? Yes, I would eat 250g of soybeans every night, and fart at 2 pm the next day. Sorry, my bad. Are you OK? Doctor Jia. I'm fine. Just got crashed by a fart. His condition, is affecting other's lives. If you want to receive treatment here, then take off your watch first! Give it to me. Give me your watch. I think we should do it slowly. Shut up. What are you doing? Song Wennuan, you're killing me. You can make it! Come on! 1 goat. 2 goats. 3 goats. 358 goats. 359 goats. 360 sheeps. Get out. 8,366 flamingos. 8,367 flamingos. 8,368 flamingos. Sorry for being late. We can start the lessons right now. Manager, I am so sorry. I was late. Try your best! Everyone, I am annoucing a good news. Mr. Bao, was late for the class. Here is a good news flash. Mr. Bao was late for the class. Once time in a thousand years I've waiting for it so long Once time in a thousand years I have no regret with that Doctor Jia said that... you need to get used to irregular things. Look, this street is messed enough. Hey, what are you doing. These things are in pairs. Why did you put it alone here. There's not another in the same color. You can just... See? This can do as well. Mommy, hug. Let's welcome boys and girls from Class One！ Mommy. Daddy. I am scared. Can you hold me while sleep? Just this one time. Baby, There are countless germs on the skin. Hugging is not hygienic. This game is not hygienic. You will play it well for sure! Just practice more. Let's take you play over there. See, mommy and daddy are not sleeping together, too. We'll be here for you. Patients like Mr. Bao, usually feel quite lonely inside. We're having a class later, let me introduce you some new friends. I call this place... the Pure Land for Souls. Some patients with serious illness, can fully enjoy the nature, and purify their souls here. Doctor Jia. Nurse Zhen. Turn up the purifier. Warning! Warning! Got spotted again. The girl is called Safe Ann. But she is the one who needs safety the most. Ann was a location host, she often went to broadcast where disasters happened. She was always overwhlemed by death, so she is armed to teeth everyday now. Look at her. Helmet. Oxygen canister. Fire extinguisher. Swimming ring. She even needs to wear a parachute to feel a little bit secured. This one is Move Zhang. He's a still model. He's able to make 3 poses in 1 second. Could you please control yourself? This is not what I wanted, too! To make more money, he changed poses faster and faster. And ended up with this. Finally get you under control! That man is a fan for Peking Opera. Everyone calls him Bomb. His favorate character is Li Kui in Water Margin.. He imitated Li Kui so often, that he became just like Li Kui in real life. He has a terrible temper, and is always irritable. We're training him to be patient in this way. Great job! Bomb! But he looks gentle. He is a time bomb. Hey, Bomb. Keep holding on! See. This part, still stands tough. It's the softest part deep in your heart. As long as they are still here, sooner or later, your paper tower will be rebuilt someday. It's just a matter of time. Here. It's not in order. I didn't see you're so annoying. Rawrrrrrrr! You are a dead man! Wennuan, that's what it is. Some patients have been here, for almost a year, or half a year. Under my meticulous care, they have got worse... more or less. This is my original treatment recovery before death. Just let the patients be whatever... and do whatever they want. Stop messing around. This is how you treat your new friend? Many of you, had told me... that you feel like you're a weirdo, and people hates you. You feel lonely because of this. I brought you guys together, I brought you guys together, not to see you fight each other. The only way we can stop feeling lonely, is reaching out for each other. Could you stopping moving at this point? I don't want to move either! Mr. Wang. As the tutor of this contest, you'll accompany us all the way to the final. Do you have anything to say to the contestants? I want to say that... Creativity is never easy. I still remember, when I started my career, I spared no efforts to creat my work at every night. Every note, and every word in the lyric, are out of my hard work. No matter how difficult it was. Remember, keep on going. Keep on creating your own music! Never give... Turn. Turn. Turn the page. Up. Excuse me, Mr. Wang. Could you please... say the last sentence again? I don't think it's necessary. I was doing great when saying the "up". Just do some editing. Mr. Wang is exhausted. Let's call it a day. See, who's that. Song Wennuan? What is she doing here? Is she coming for you? We'll see what she's capable of. Just give her some time. If she can get in here, I can also get her out. I don't want to run, I'll sweat and make my cloth dirty. This is doctor Jia's assignment for you. You have no choice. I've even got you the helps. Everyone! Welcome to the Color Run! During the match, people will throw color powders on you. The more colors on you, the more popular you are. Let's enjoy running, among all the colors! Steady!

This is the song for the rematch. We'll start rehearse tomorrow. Here, enjoy yourselves. Thanks. It's an act of providence that we run into this accident. Cheers. Finish it. I didn't know you can drink. Alcohol can kill germs, appropriate amount of drinks is good for the body. Sauteed intestines is here. What are you looking at? Eat. Mr. Bao, have a bite, then have a drink. Ah, what a day! Come and take a bite, Emmm... The large intestines is the place where animals' excrements go through. It connects to the intestine at the top, and anal at the bottom. Near the anal... Darling, what's the matter? I feel a little bit sick. Oi! I am still having the dishes! Sorry, it's all yours. Whatever. Mr. Wang. The audition of the King of Original Songs has come to the end. As the tutor of the contest, do you have anything to say to the contestants? I want to say that... creativity is never easy. I myself have come all the way here by creating. I still remember, when I started my career, I spared no efforts to creat my work at every night. Keep on creating your own music! Never give up! Bullshit! No, the shit should be from the pigs. Liar! Hypocrite! Isn't he the tutor of the rematch? He couldn't write even a single song! Nonsense. He wrote all the songs himself. I used to have a relationship with him, back then when he was still nobody. It was me who wrote the songs for him. I credited all my songs to him, just to make him popular. And gradually, he gained reputation, and was recognized as the king of originals by the public. He got more and more busy. And I had to write songs for him around the clock. Do you know how much Quick Fix Pills I had to take... when I feel bad at the midnight? 6 pills. Full 6 pills. But do you know what he was doing? Why are you here? We're having a meeting. Mr. Wang, please sign the contract. The meeting is over. Wennuan. My dear. Wennuan. I'll take this song. Isn't he the worst? Yes, I'm your Vol Wang! We will rock the stage! Ladies and gentlemen! Sing with us! Friends at upstairs, how are you doing! Just follow me! One. Two. Three. Song Wennuan. What the hell are you doing? It's middle of the night! Do you want to enjoy the footbath water again? Hey! Sister Mary, you slowed a bit again. Seriously, huh? I'm telling you, we've got so many customers today. This tub is from Mr. Li. This tub is from Mr. Zhang. And this tub is mine. Ha, ha. sister Mary You missed the target. Good night! Song Wennuan! Let's wait and see! Are we rehearsing or not? No. I can't do it. Whatever! Damn! It feels good. What suits me most is, a corner with the window closed Only avoiding all the eyes, can help me through my nerves. Loneliness silences me, my heart wanders night by night They talk about me, Mr. Bao. I find that you're quite cute sometime. No one has said I'm cute ever. In others' eyes, I was always a wierdo, Well, you are a little bit weird, but in a cute way. Harder and harder When everyone sees me as a weirdo, You say, silly, over here Life shall be infinite, beauty shall be its color Stop hiding, you're the reason for stars to shine Don't you see it？ You're so cute I came to the competition, because of my enthusiasm for music. It is the music elf's promise to its dream. Must I say this later? Sure. And don't forget this pose. Here comes the car! Come on! Vol, Vol! You are our WOLF! Vol, Vol! You are our LIFE! Vol, Vol! You are our LOVE! Wennuan, you're here for the contest, too? Yes. And I wrote a song for you. Hope you enjoy it later. Wow, you are really a mature girl now. Cheer up. Let's welcome next group of contestants. Go Back to Life! We can do it! Thief You get away without pay Thief You sick me with no delay Thief You stole everything away My heart And my songs You thief You come to me with sweety Taking the poem in illusory Naive as I was to believe you To be deceived Is the song about him? Yes. And I will sing it out in front of him. I will show everyone through this compeition what a talent Song Wennuan is. I am the real king of originals! Lies Can't be lies forever I mean you If you show up Where to see In the minute Don't sweat People will see you through Unfaithful lover Finally feed youself with lies A big fat face If you show up In front of my face Apology will have Never, never Sorry as my response Thanks for Go back to life. You show is so thrilling. I see Mr. Wang is sweating a lot. What's the problem? Just got tired. Maybe due to the low blood sugar. Nothing serious. OK. Now, tutors. Please give your comments on the show. I think this song is extraodinary. In the warmth of spring, this song bring a wind that is... chill, horrible, terrible, and so creepy. Got chocked on the saliva. Maybe the man in this song also has his unknown reasons? Is it necessary to write a song, to satirize this man, who must be rich and charming? I think the girl in the song, is not thinking in the big picture. I don't fancy it. So I'm giving a fail to this song. Mochou, now that I gave a fail, what about you? Well, I always talk straight. Just be straight. Tell us what's wrong with the song. I think it's really a great song. This girl, she put her complaints toward a bad guy into the song. Therefore... I'm giving you a pass. The man in the song, is a thief not only of love, but also of other's creations. I think this kind of man... deserves each and every harsh penalty. Even got his body cut into pieces, or limbs split by horses, are not enough to teach him a lesson. Am I right? Mr. Wang. In short, Go Back to Life, see you at the final! Pass! Congratulations! In the rematch of the King of Original Songs, the group received much attention, Go Back to Life, has made their way to the final with their exciting original Thief. And the two group members, Song Wennua and Bao Bao are increasingly popular. What kind of surprise would they bring us in the final? Let's wait and see. Here, guys. Have something to eat. Guys, enjoy yourselves. The bread is a bit dry. Have something to eat. Oh my god. The chilly frogs. The sauteed intestines. Here, Bao, have a bite. Come on, it's really good. Here, take a bite. Just have a bite. Just have a bite. Just have a bite. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Mr. Bao. One, two, three... fifteen. None Twenty. You are doing great, Bao. Brave enough to eat the sauteed intestines. In fact, it's better than I imagined... It's really out of my expectation, that you beacme almost another person in such a short time. Cheers, Thanks to Song Wennuan. Otherwise, I wouldn't make it. Actually, you're helping her, too. After broke up with Vol Wang, she just stayed at home, and didn't write any songs at all. Later, Wennuan came to me for treatment. She told me about her past, and I thought the best way to get Wennuan back on her feet, is to write more songs. So, I encouraged her to participate in this match. Hope she can give us a song that can actually warm people, in the stage of the final. That's terrifying! I thought the chili frog came alive. I'll go get some more. Thank you for taking the competetion with me. Thank you for changing me for a better man. Hey, Bao. Love is one big illusion, I should try to forget. Do you still remember? Cut the craps. I have to thank you for all my achievements today. You've took so many pills to get me here. Wennuan, could you do that for me again? Come to my company. We can be just like the old days, you write songs and I'll sing them. Don't worry. All the songs you write will be credited with your name. We offer great welfares. House rents, medical insurance, even the Quick Fix Pills, are all covered. No matter how much salary you expected, just write a figure. I just want one thing in return. I just want you to quit. The minute you quit, I'll make the call, to activate your medical insurance. Your words make me sick. Leave me alone. What a bitch! You thought I had no idea why you participated the competiton? All you want is to destroy me, right? It will never happen. Just quit. Quit the competiton. Right now! We will not quit. You don't care about the competition. You are just here to make a scene. No, I got higher goals. I came to the competition, because of my enthusiasm for music. It is the music elf's promise to its dream. You're seeking justice for her, right? Elfin. Alright. Come here. Bao. Leave it to me. Good. Go ahead. I didn't expect you to be this good. I give up. Anyway, Song Wennuan, listen. In the final, if you dare to... See you at the final. You're good at folding clothes. Why don't you open a dry cleaner? Sorry, I was late. Hurry up, ladies and gentlemen. The news briefing will start soon. Thanks for your cooperation. Excuse me. I got two extra eyebrows, could you please pull them off for me? Of course. May I know which two you are referring to exactly? Well, the sixth and seventh eyebrow, on the third row. Oh, these two. I see. OK, lay back. It may hurt a little. Hello, Mr. Bao. I am the agent of Vol Wang. He want to have a talk with you. I don't have anything to talk with him. It's something about Song Wennuan. Lead the way. Mr. Bao, here you are. If you're gonna ask me to quit, just save the words. Cause I would never quit. It is the music elf's promise to... OK, OK. I know you bear those words in mind. To its dream. Look at the table. There's a newspaper. I read newspaper... only at at 9:30 am. Mr. Bao. You're so stubborn. I knew you're different from others, since the first time I met you. You have this... unique style. So, I wanted to get to know you more. Hard work finally pays. I found this newspaper published 20 years ago, in which there's a report... about you. I'm willing to go through this with you. Hug is a way to show our love. It is also the most direct and natural interaction between people. Hug can bring us happiness. Sweeties, is there anything else apart from happiness, that hug can bring us? Love. Fragrance. Itchiness. Itchiness? Why? Dad hugs me everyday, and he pricles me with his beard. OK. Bao, do you have an answer? Sorry, I don't. Miss, no one has hugged him. Even his parents don't give him a hug. Yes! I saw it, when we were having the sports meeting. Happy birthday! My sweetheart! It's your birthday gift! A huggy bear! Here, take it. I don't want the huggy bear. I want a hug from you. Be a good boy, honey. Let's go home. I want nothing but your hug! Bao, be a sweetheart. Or I'll get angry. Darling! No! You were just asking for a hug. But it end up with a tragedy. It was said that... your mother died in the mental hospital at the end. I think it is something you couldn't get over with. Daddy. Mommy. I know it's all my fault. I'll do whatever you told me from now on. I will be clean all the time. I will put all the things in order. I will do thing on time. And I will never ask you to hug me. I'd keep them in mind... that hugging is not hygienic, for there are numerous germs on skins. Mommy. Daddy. Please, come back. I'm so scared on my own. I can tell that... you are quite into Wennuan. But can you make her happy? I don't think you can even hug her like a normal people. You are a weirdo. Don't be her burden. The sooner you leave her, the better it is for her. Otherwise, she would be the one who suffers the most in the end. Where's Bao? I don't know. Where has he been? Hey, Bao. What's the matter? Can you say a word? Don't come to me again. Why? Because I hate you. You are messy and untidy. You don't make plans. And I can't stand these. My life becomes a mess since I met you. You forced me to eat things I don't want to eat, and forced me to do things I don't want to do. I've had enough. The only reason you wanted to change me, is that you needed a partner for the competition. I don't want to see you again. It's not what it is... Bao. It's such a mess outside your home. So many pieces of paper, and so many footprints. It's so untidy. Totally a mess. Even people like me can't stand it. You should come out and have a look. We can clean it up together. It takes all the fortune, to meet you in my life. Would like to get closer to you, Bao. I did want to change you for the competition at the first, but I'm doing it for other reasons now. It still takes lots of courage. Jump into the crowd and hold you tight, it happens only in my mind. Thought the yearning has torn me down, I stand still in the ground. Turn around and leave, I disappear in the wind. Looking back through the crowd, I utter in no words. Jump into the crowd and hold you tight, it happens only in my mind. Thought the yearning has torn me down, I stand still in the ground. Turn around and leave, I disappear in the wind. Looking back through the crowd, I am left alone with only mine. Dear Bao. Happy birthday to you! When you're reading this letter, you should be 6 years old. And today, we want to make an apology to you. When you were just born, me and your father watched you lying in the crib. We looked at your little face, and we wanted nothing but to... hold you tight in our arms. But we couldn't make it. And we're so sorry for that. To make it up, we named you Bao Bao. We thought about giving the name in hug meaning, is the same as give you real hugs. But as you grew older, we found that you were not satisfied with only the name. You desired a real hug. Thus, everytime you opened your arms for a hug, and we couldn't make our response, we felt terribly sorry. This time, we're determined to get rid of our problems, so that we can give you, our love, a real hug. No matter how hard it would be, we will manage to do it! Honey, we promise you. Once you learned to play A Doll With A Bear, we will give you a huge hug as reward. And at the sports meeting next year, we will hug you like others parents, and play games with your friends. We will be the number 1! Next time it thunders and rains, if you dare not to sleep alone, we will have you in our arms. It is our love to you, gives us the strength to change ourselves. In the future days, you should be as brave as us. Hug everyone loves you with your courage, in spite of anything else. Love you. Dad and mom. Song Wennuan, I'm sorry. I did it wrong. I have words for you. You goddamn psycho. What are you yelling? You want to try the water washed my feet? Wennuan, You are the one who was always by my side, when I felt lonely and helpless. You gave the the courage, to make a better person out of me. But, But I turned my back on you. I didn't keep my words. Please, give me one more chance. It is the music elf's... promise to... it dream. It's quite moving actually. Bao! Bao! Song Wennuan, In my personal view, he is a nice elf. If you don't like him, I'll make him mine. Oi! Doctor Jia, Bao has passed out. What happened? Maybe he was drowned. Drowned by what? By the water of feet washing. He's in critical condition. I'll try to save him right now. Here, hold his arms tight. I've tried my best. I've slapped him as hard as I could. I think he's exhausted. We've tried, just let him have a good sleep. Next time you can just send him... to the bath center. It stinks. Mr. Wang. Oh! Sorry for interrupting you. I'm reading the newspaper. What are you here for? Nothing important. It's time for your rehearsal. OK. I'll be there when I finish reading this editorial. Hey! Why is it here? It is this goddamn newspaper that we used to force Bao to leave. Why are you still keeping it? Sorry. I forgot it. Anything you didn't forget? Have you increased the number of safeguards? The final will be held tonight. What if that psycho came to mess around? Take it easy, things are all well-arranged. It better be. Let's go to the rehearsal. Wennuan. It's all Vol Wang's fault. Check this out, Where's Bao? This is my treatment of recovery before death. Bao has been living in highly clean environment for a long time. And last night, he suddenly got irritated by amount of external pollutants. So, he experienced a strong psychological rejection, which led to his passing out. But the whole night of recovery, is like the nirvana. Bao has reshaped himself, and he is rising from the ashes. Doctor Jia. I passed out because you slapped me so hard. Give me my coat. Wait, I fold it for you. Bao, why don't you tell me? I have a word. Now that we've sorted things out, do you still want to take part in the competition? Cause if you do, you need to hurry up. The final will begin soon. You are the last to show up. It's up to you, Bao. It's a music elf's promise to its dream. We're in. OK. But Vol Wang has increased the safeguards, just to stop you from getting in. Then we'll break in. I'll go with you. Haven't got to fight for a long time. I'm kind of missing it. Count me in. I can't stay well at home anyway. The most dangerous place is the safest place. Count me in, too. I will be waiting you at the stage. Go for it! OK. Take back the stage for Wennuan! For Wennuan! Take back the stage! It's 20 miles away. We'll be dead before we get there. Do I look like a man without a plan? It's a good day today. All our dreams come true. Hey! Did I arrive on time? Let's go! Captain, There's a funeral car at the door. Several THINGS are getting out. Don't worry. I'm here. How dare you move. Captain, it's a total defeat. Hey, wake up. Wake up. Damn, where is this place? There's no cell signal at all. Shit. The door is locked. When the strength is not working, we need to use our brain. Isn't this the interview room? Safe, you've been a live journalist. Can you check the equipments? Are they qualified for us to broadcast live here? Let me have a look. I think it's OK. We need to get ready for the live. And then transmit the signal to the control room. As long as the director can receive our signal, the scene will be showed at the competition. Time is running out for us Guys, come on! Let's do it! Move! Move! I don't think I have ever stopped. Hey, guys. Are we ready? Camera ready. Lights ready. Sound ready. Only one more step left. We have to find a way, to have the director switch into our signal. So that our scene will be on live. Director Director, here we are! Now, let's welcome the last group of contestants for this round. Go Back to Life. It's our turn.. Host, can you please buy me some time? Go Back to Life will show themselves. I give you my word. Mr. Bao. Come back. Be quick. Please come back. We've run out of time. This height should be fine. I can jump off to notice the director. It's not gonna work. You can't even open the parachute at the height. It's not parachuting. It's just jumping off the building. I thought you're scared of death the most. You can't do it. Try to say something, to stall for more time. What show... will the last group of contestants bring to us. Let's wait and see I'm not scared of anything as long as you're with me. Safe It's a great pity, that due to some personal factors, Go Back to Life, could not make it to the stage of the final. Ladies and gentlemen! Go Back to Life... has come back!
