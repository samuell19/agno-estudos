SEVEN DAYS SOMEWHERE ELSE Paris, tuesday Feb. 20th No, no, stop! Start over again. Music, go back. Fabian, your buttocks! You weren't all together. Are you ready? OK, positions! Music, please. We're fighting over a girl. Which one? Anyone... but not this one. You can have that one. Raoul! I altered the ants theme. Listen to it. When the theme returns, the bongo comes in like this... Now stop talking. There are 2 goldfish in a glass bowl. They turn and turn on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Suddenly, one says to the other: "What will we do on Sunday, I wonder?" Jacques, give me a lift? Sorry, my wife's using our car. Talk to me, Madam. Talk to me, Sir. Talk to me, Sir... talk to me. DEAFNESS IS NOW MASTERED I don't know exactly. Every time, I think that perhaps... I don't know what's going on. I dunno... I feel awkward. I wonder if it's because of me. I don't understand what's happening. Yes, they're devoted to each other. Besides, she's lovely... Yes, very, very... She's very enamored. "The" great amorous girl! "Do you know how to live? Really live? "To live... is going elsewhere. "To live... is feeling good at home. "Work is also living. "And the two remaining days..." Where did you find it? It arrived this morning. I kept it. It's strange. Strange, yes. We got to move house. What time are you leaving? Don't know exactly. 7.30, I think. Want a sandwich? No. I don't know. I'll have one in the train. And a beer. I can make one. You can, yes. What have you done today? I've been drawing. What did you draw? You know what. Don't you feel well? I do... Why? I don't know. Let's see what's inside. Nothing! Look at the big house and big trains. And this box! You're not going to... - What's that? - A record. That's for Daddy's work. Look, you'll laugh. Isabel, come eat. - I'll make a necklace. Like a queen. - Isabel, come on! Not a queen... a king! A king's got to have a crown. Stop playing with her! Look! A lovely gold crown for you. You'll miss your train. You're the Queen of the House. I want to see her. Just look at yourself. Isabel, your dinner. Now you're the Queen of the House! You're the Queen of the House! The Queen of the House! Dad's the King, not the Queen. Isabel made a nice sketch today. A pink Eiffel Tower, underwater. - I asked her why. - Anne... Where have you put my other shirt? It's not ironed. You're too much! It's not ironed. I asked you to. Hey... give me money for the telephone bill. The telephone, and 30,000 frs besides. You really are too much. - I'm very sorry, but... - You are. Hurry! Only 15 minutes left. The phone bill's higher every time. - Look, Jacques... - It doesn't amuse me to go. I know. Going away to pay for the phone, TV, the radio, dresses, and the rest is no fun. We spend half our life doing that... paying bills and drafts... I'm fed up! I don't do what I'd like to... I go on tour... to earn money! You can choose, you know. Choose what? - You can change... - I can leave, yes. You can do what you long to do. No, I can't. You can. When one really and truly wants something... What do you want? What time is it? We've got 15 minutes. What suitcase shall I take? The black one. The big one? Hurry up. Do you understand me? Yes, I do. If you want to do something, do it. Anyway, that's only secondary. Don't make a drama of it. Yes, but... I'm leaving, Anne. I know you're leaving. I mean, some day I'll be leaving for good. I'm fed up with all this. - I'll pack. - It's your choice. Come and help me. No. You're sad, aren't you? "Our love needs love more than grass needs rain." When I was 20, I knew Eluard by heart. Reproaching me? I happened to remember. On the right? Makes no difference. If this carries on, I'll be late. I won't go with you onto the platform. I'll write to you on Tuesday or Wednesday. As you like. They're all asleep. It's wonderful! I keep thinking about that boy. Awful! They were rough. Who, the cops? Bastards! Wasn't he wounded? Yes, he was. Didn't you see? The police handcuffed him. His foot was injured. And they pushed him hard. The dirty dogs! It's their job. Their job, Madam... is to arrest, not to bully people. Don't you know a young girl's been strangled? Perhaps he did it. That's no reason to hurt a wounded man. No mercy for murderers! - Easy to see you've no children. - What?! Maybe he didn't do it. He'll be judged. They don't have to maltreat him. It was horrible! We're standing up for him, because he was handsome. We all wanted him! Montpellier, thursday Feb. 22nd Jacques! From here, please speed up. Take your place, Theresa. Good. Understand now? You've found your marks? - All right, Mr Andrew? - Not so much. Birds are dopes. Hear me, birds? Dopes! All by yourself? The others bore me. Is that good? "On a train, the dead are more shaken than us. "Speed disturbs them, they can't keep quiet. "They bend more and more. They speak bluntly to us. "We must treat them rudely... "flatten them against the backs... "then their heads bump. We must hold them tightly. Very important. "Would someone give his seat to the lady? No. "He takes a corpse on his lap and..." Hand me the salt. Is that good? What is it? Just listen: "And Lucky Luke walked away into the desert..." Not cheerful! Don't know it? That's the last song. I don't know it. - What's that? - Steak and salad. To be eaten together? Josette! I asked you something. What? - Some salt on the meat. - Can't you see with your hands? You know that one? In a field were 1 0 girls, All marriageable girls. there was Dine and Chine, Claudine and Martine... Catherinette and Catherinon. then, lovely Suzon, Duchess of Monbazon... there was Celimene... And there was Dumene. - One more point for me. - I'll mark it. That makes six. Then, Catherine... and Jacques: 6 - 1. Wait now, you'll see. I'm sure to know it. Yes, I know it! In a dark jail with blackened walls... A bunch of prisoners are walking round in circles. their heads are bent, their faces pale... Numbers on their arms like real convicts. I'm wondering what they have done. Are they killers, bandits, crooks? Guys who don't hesitate to live their own way... And kill honest workmen to rob them. 7 to 3. Zero! You didn't find any. Wait, I'm going to stump you. I'd be surprised! - Well? - Go on! - Dunno it? - Sing it again. No, I don't know it. two lovers, forgetting the noisy city... Dreamed of love along a country road... Awfully silly, your song! - I couldn't know it. - Wait! Like a wise man, he said: I shall give you a shelter... sweet and quiet, made for our hearts. It's too stupid! Mark one point. It's a small nest hidden under moss... With an old well and reddish-brown tiles, A small garden smelling of rosemary... Huddling easily... Among the rose-trees, near the church. Teach me how to drive. We shall live enchanting hours... And the end: ...far from bugaboos! You want to? What's up? I'll hire a car. I will! Wait here. I won't move. Come back. I'll look for a car. No, don't leave me alone. Wait for me, don't pay anything. I'll pay the bill and get a car. Accelerate a bit. I declutch... I declutch with my left foot... I declutch... 1st gear... 1st gear! - Where is it? - Stay calm. Change into second gear! And accelerate again. You want to turn left. What will you do? No! You want to turn left. Your indicator doesn't work. You signal with your head. Like this. Not your arm. Keep your hands on the wheel. I turn left... now right, to deceive the enemy. Every other driver is an enemy. Relax. Think happy thoughts. Now... ignition. Hurry, but don't get nervous. Accelerate... Neutral... 1st gear... Now start slowly. See if there's nobody behind. A girl on a horse. A girl on a horse? Fine! It's quite easy. Now, eyes closed... a bend! You're raving mad! We're doing 18 mph, you're in 4th gear. - No, I changed gears. - Now reverse. - I changed gears. - Reverse, I said! Wait... I'm in 4th gear, dammit! Ignition! Breathe first. - There! - No... Inhale! It won't start if you don't breathe. 1st gear. Aren't you looking behind you? Slowly... slowly. Faster! Second... when I say so. Second... Faster! Look behind you! Third, third... Hurry! Done it! Have you changed? She's changed! 4th gear... Reverse... Stop! Don't take the bend! I don't want to see that! - Go around... - Where? The circle. A car over there... Careful! Slow down, left, left... Stay calm. We're going too much to the left. Get off the wheel! Declutch... OK, next left. - Again? - Yes, that's it. Always pass on the other side of the yellow line. Every time you see a yellow line. - Look at that plane. - Not now! You'd better... OK, now you drive very well... I can change into 2nd gear. Yes. And you accelerate. Again! Again! 3rd! For the 20th time... ignition! Breathe hard. Think happy thoughts. 1st... We'll start calmly. Get into 1st gear. Now let yourself go. Accelerate a bit. Wonderful! Now... 2nd. Like a dream! - Look. - It's good to stop. The moss... and the sun. I thought about you, you know. You're going out tonight, too? You're bored? OK, Anne, I'll say goodbye. I'm going to work. You'll write to me? I'll phone tomorrow. Or the day after. To tell you... how it worked. Goodbye, Anne. Yes. Me, too... Montpellier, Friday Feb. 23rd Anne, why have we reached such silence? I've nothing to say. I'm going to leave. How do you manage to live? to be happy? I find it impossible. this is a big cat. For Isabel. there's nothing left. Where's life? Where's music? I'm frightened. Help me! Anne, I love you Look at that photo. Taken at home. He's so funny! - He's not with you? - No, he lives with my in-laws. Who's that guy? Hey, come off it! It's Mom. You know, the way we're always on tour or at the theater, nights out, and all... how can I look after him? I had to find someone. It's the same with your daughter. She only thinks about classical ballet. When did you begin? I must've been ten, I think. I was so unhappy to lose her. I'm so afraid to have a baby! You're crazy. If you knew! It's fantastic. But it must be terrible... I'd prefer a painless birth. It's nothing at all to have a baby. Easier than a dancing lesson. When it was all over... and you came to see me at the hospital... I told you it's easier than the parallel bars. You follow what's happening. There's just a little unpleasant period called the "transitional period". You're dilated, and it's just before the expulsion. But you've special counts to help you. For us dancers, it's terrific. You just concentrate on that. And after, you've got a voice like this... After that rather painful moment comes the expulsion. - You're conscious? - All the time. They hold your legs, like this. And when the baby is about to come out... you feel practically nothing. They tell you: "Inhale... exhale... hold your breath." You hold your breath, you hold on like that. Then you push and push. Then all the people in the room... come in front of you and look. But you're not embarrassed... There's such a perfect understanding. And the doc says: "Push on, I can see its hair. "Stop!" And you relax. Then you feel another contraction. "Inhale... exhale... hold your breath!" "Push!" They're all around. "Push! Again... again!" Your vocal cords stick out... And then... slowly... slowly... Its head comes out... After another contraction, its arms. Then the doc told me: "Take hold of him." I had the baby here. He said: "Pull him out." I said no. I was afraid. He said "Go on!" and stepped back. He was through. So I took hold of the baby and pulled it out. You can't imagine how I felt. Painless childbirth isn't about muscles... It's about controlling your body. You feel a pain coming, but you don't care. You've just got to count, as I told you already. There's that special breathing: 1, 2... And during this painful moment, the midwife says: "1, 2, exhale... 1, 2, exhale!" You've learned it and are used to it, it helps you a lot. You know it by heart? Yes, you rehearse it often. When you're rehearsing the expulsion... the midwife says: "Don't push too hard, it'll come out." So you're trained. Yet there's your body. You don't suffer, but it's violent. Nothing's more violent than that. There's no sensation that's more incredible than that. If you get panicky, you're done for. But if you take it as a performance... it's exciting. Then comes the joy of having the baby. But giving birth in itself is fascinating... It's exciting, wonderful! I relived it for a week... for at least a year. Sometimes, I relive it just for my own pleasure. God, I want to have a baby, too. I don't know who with. So, have one, then. My guy doesn't want to. Life? Yes. I'm happy. Totally happy? When it's over, I'll see. Who's got an elastic band to tie my horse-tail? Don't laugh at me! Well, you try! Not everyone can have one like that! It doesn't work. Gerald says he wants a daughter like me. Even if I've got a horse-tail, he wants a daughter like me. When you hear that, you want it too. It's not often that you're told something like that. If he says: "I want a girl just like you"... well, I'm ready. But it wouldn't be funny if she weren't like me. Even a son could be like me. If I have a son, he can be like me. Put on your make-up. I hate to do it. Where's my mirror? You're crazy! All for you. I'm not cheerful, am I? What's the matter? Nothing... You know what. My life isn't much fun at the moment. I'm going to leave Anne. Jean's leaving me. Jean's leaving me... He met another girl. She's beautiful and clever. He's going away with her. That's all. It's not much fun. It's even worse than that. to Bordeaux, Saturday Feb. 24th I can't do my job as I'd like to. Not a thought to catch on to. It's a disaster. I can't even compose anymore. Happiness on credit. If I could sail away... all by myself... with a Steinway. The saltwater would spoil it. But reality... isn't on a boat. There's a music school in Boston. What kind of school? What kind of school? - Funny, I'm not ambitious. - I can't hear. You're right, go away. You must do it. - No one does that. - If I stay, I'll get mad. You need courage to go. Bordeaux, Sunday Feb. 25th You've got a good genius. March 1 967. The big strike in Rhodia's vocabulary. Original by its duration... by its form: factories occupied... and above all, by that idea... that the imbalance in labor brings an imbalance in life... that no salary increase could compensate... and that it's not enough to insert it in a so-called welfare society... in a so-called leisure civilization... but to call into question the society and civilization. I work four shifts. And the week has 7 days. Let's take this week so you'll understand. It's pretty complicated. tuesday-Wednesday, I work in the morning. thursday-Friday, in the afternoon. Saturday-Sunday-Monday, at night. 2 days by day and 3 days by night. So I work 7 days in succession. If I'm on nights, I come home at 4.30 a.m. My wife goes to work at 6.30. I see her at noon. I'm half-awake and grouchy... because I haven't had enough sleep. And everything goes wrong. She comes back at 6.30 p.m. and I leave at 7.20. She does the cooking. We eat in a hurry, I scram. When I work afternoons, I get back at 8 p.m. She's tired, she goes to bed early. We hardly ever go out. Not to mention our kid. My wife's work is harder than mine. She has to take the girl to school. I can't do it 'cause of my hours. She leaves the kid with the people who keep her. At noon, she fetches her. then she takes her back at 1.30. So, she takes her downstairs at 1.30. then, she goes back upstairs for 1 5 minutes. We have no family life. A girl is entitled to something better. When we work, we do nothing useful. We bring in our wages, of course... but we work for nothing, really. It isn't worthwhile! If you touch my hand... we both die. I don't want to touch it. Culture, for us, is a struggle. Same as we're entitled to have food and a roof... we assert our right to culture. And just as we fight for culture... we fight for the union or politics. the management delegate speaks easily of culture. But never of unions or political parties. Culture is theirs, they own it. So they can talk about it. Try and resist... no, not so fast! You've no willpower. I feel the warmth of your hand. Want to go back? You really want to? No, I want to go. Where to? The hotel. Why? Are you sleepy? Don't you feel OK? Yes, but we'd better be alone. You want to be alone? With you. And afterwards? I don't know. What do you mean? Afterwards, I don't know. Let's go back. My gentle cat... I said: "my gentle cat". Is it a good room? 2,000 francs. Get off my mirror. You're always in my way. Even in front of a mirror! Go to the bathroom. Ain't she a bore! Not such a bad room. Rather pretty. With a large bed. And another for voyeurs! You're sex mad! Did the guy pay a lot for it? How much did you pay? Did it cost you a lot? He's shy, he won't answer. My love! Ask him how much it cost him. Got a light? How did it end at Tony's, the other night? - Nothing happened. - You and your big virgin! Oh, you can talk! - Why? - With your pig of a rugby man! A pig? He's handsome and strong. Not like your shrimp of a man! Will you hurry up? Got to make myself pretty. To give him his money's worth. In such a swell place! Some people are really crazy. Listen to this, honey. The other day, there was a guy... about 35, not bad, who asked us: "Say, girls, would you like to whip a man? You'll get a nice gift and plenty of money." We laughed, and he went away. But we'd been afraid he'd whip us... and with the marks, how could we work? to Paris, Monday Feb. 26th Anne! Paris... April... Subtitles processed by C.M.C. - Paris
