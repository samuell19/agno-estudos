Hey, slow down, you jerk! I'm beat... Give us a blow-back... come on. I need to chill out. So what's with Elenitsa? Saw her at the Castle the other night. Hey, she didn't even look at you! Why should she? She was with Dimitrakis. Do you know what Dimitrakis' old man bought him, you jerk? A brand new car, man! A fucking convertible! And a new watch. Solid gold... Shut up! I'm sick of her. Sick of the whole lot of you. You included! - Me? - Yeah you! Me? Kotsian? Shitface! Shit! That killed me you asshole! Hey! Do the chicken! OK, boys. We've got hot stuff today. This is Olga. Does great blow jobs. Plenty to grab hold of. Take her on her knees. The lovely Olga. Our golden girl. Our special offer... Little Olga... Well? Any takers? No? Freeloaders! Solo or double act... Olga's easy... Upstairs on the left... Enjoy... - Good evening. - You speak Russian? Of course. - Hey, what's your name? - Pond... Rosso Pond. My friends call me Sasha. - Where are you from? - Kazakhstan... - When did you come to Greece? - 1990. With my folks. I was only ten... - Where do you live? - Mounidi... (Cunt City) - Do you go to school? - Nope. - Got a job? - Used to... on construction sites. Gave it up though. Drove me crazy. Hard work... Got a bad back... Fucking construction work has done me in. Aren't you eating with us? No. I'll grab something later... How's work? I said how's work? What are we supposed to do with you? How do you expect us to feed you? On air? I'm not going back to the construction site. I'm not going back. So why aren't they biting tonight? I've been around too long. They all know me... Shit... I've got a date tonight too. Saturday night. It's embarrassing when the Babe's gotta pay your way. - You been working Omonoia long? - Since I was 13. Now that's tragic. Retired at your age... You think so? Fuck you! - Careful. It's from Kalamata. - We got good stuff in Menidi too. The crap you get from the gypsies? That's garbage... The Albanian stuff? What's wrong with it? - Full of hormones. - Hormones? They put shit in the soil. I'm telling you, you can't beat Greek stuff... From Pyrgos, Serres... gorgeous stuff... - from Kalamata... - I heard you the first time. I like home-grown things. How about you? - Want to go out tonight? - Dunno... Oh fuck, broke again? Am I paying again? How's about a fuck? - Bit of a ladies' man, huh? - Sure, I got lots of girls. - In Menidi? - Everywhere. Now I found some in Athens. Different ones... Loaded. Good for a quick shag. And they pay your way in clubs. - What about Elenitsa? - She's different... She's one of us... She's a Pontian (from the Black Sea). I'm gonna marry her when I'm 25... start a family... She's still young. 15... just a kid. - In the meantime? - We keep on fucking... - Who? Elenitsa? - No way! She's gotta stay pure. A virgin... - Other girls? - I told you. I got plenty. Aren't you sick of that jerk? Dimitris isn't a jerk. OK, he's not a jerk. He's a wanker. - Want to get back together? - I can't. - Why not? - My Dad doesn't like you. It's you I want, not your Dad. He says you're useless. You've got no job... nothing. Useless? It's the wanker. He remembered I'm here. - I'll see you around then? - I don't think so. Fucking whores. The lot of them... They chew you up, then spit you out. You fall in love, they shit on you. You tell them you love them and they're checking your wallet... Fuck! I've had enough. She's been taking you for a ride, huh? Screw her. So what do you say? Have you thought about it? I heard you left the building site. Smart move... That shit's only for suckers ...and Albanians. - How much? - One fifty. - One fifty? What's her name? - Natasha. Not another one! Natashas every fucking where these days. - Does she speak Greek? - Not a word. All the better. So how come you're selling her? For the money! What else? She's really bust my balls! Wants to get married and shit. Says she loves me. Yeah, right! The bitch just wants her fucking ID card... - How long's she been a hooker? - She's been around. - Do I get a go? - Sure. We're family aren't we? - How much are you getting? - Two. - Million? - Million. I've got expenses. Think about it. Food, tickets, hotels... all sorts of shit... Well? Are you in? I'm in. - Heard a good one yesterday. - Yeah? Let's hear it. There's this babe, right? An older woman. Goes into a male brothel. The Madam checks her out and says: "Lady, we got Russians and we got Ponds." "What's the difference," the babe asks. "The Russians' dicks are long and thin... and the Ponds' are short and fat." The babe thinks it over. Then she asks the Madam: "Got any Russian Ponts?" Good one. Jerk! How's it going? Where have you been? Things to do... Got a light? Yeah... Come on, darling. We've got work... See you around. Regular goldmine... her thighs. - What the hell's gotten into you, Giorgio? - One word out of you and you're history. - Do you like her? - Not bad. See how crazy she is about me? Take a look at this... Come on... don't be shy. Make yourself at home. What the hell are you doing? Leave that song on. Yeah, asshole! I can't drive without music. - I heard a good one. - Not another one! Shut up and listen. It's good. There's this American... - and this Russian... - Should we laugh now? Shut it! So the American looks at the Russian... unzips his fly and takes out this huge dick. - Like mine, huh Blackie? - Yeah, exactly. So he slams his dick on the table and says to the Russian: "My name's Bill... Bouffalo Bill." OK Buffalo. The Russian takes a look, unzips his fly... and takes out two enormous dicks. He slams them on the table and says: "My name's Bill... Cherno-Byl." - Good, huh? - Good? What the fuck's that? - Can you eat it? - Don't you get it, you jerks? Are you kidding? You don't know what Chernobyl is? I do. So tell us, Panagioti. The suspense is fucking killing me. They dropped an atom bomb there. - They did? When? - Years ago. - Who? - The Americans... Do I know? Cool joke, Blackie. Real cool... - Idiots. - Jerks. - What happened? - Fuck it all. - Hello? - Hello. Nikos... It's Sasha. - Oh hi. - Shall I come round? - Where are you? - Omonoia. In an hour. You're back with Nikos? What can I do? I gotta go down to Glyfada. - Aren't you sick of him yet? - Yeah, a bit. - Remember where you met him? - At the Factory one night. He pays you more than the others, right? - Twenty thou. Not bad. - What do you mean not bad? It's double what you get in Omonoia. And no hassle. Yeah. He picks me up from Faliro, we go to his place... I do what I gotta do. Wham bam... That's all there is to it. - And he's never tried to fuck you... - Nobody fucks me. Ever. He must be really into you. For 20 thou... He's fucking nuts about me. Get this! He worked for a record company, Katy Garbi's label. - Sure you don't want a line? - Never touch the stuff. Strictly grass. God's gift. You know me... Religious, huh? You believe in God? Sure. Good for you, boy. Confession... it's a great thing. After here you'll go straight to a whorehouse... to absolve your sins, right? Something like that... How's Panagioti doing? Just fine. Well? How about it...? I hate you. Why? Everything I said came true, didn't it? Why are you selling me? What's the problem? Money? Aren't I making enough? You make enough. You want more? Here! Take it all... you fucking Greek... Why don't you love me? If you've got a girlfriend who you think is trash... Make her a whore and rake in the cash... Get it? You'll stay with Sasha for a bit while I sort things out.. One phone call and you're back in Russia... And you don't want that, do you now? Who is she? You don't know her. She's new. With the money I make out of you. I'm gonna buy her. That simple... Sure. Hey, what you listening to? House. Hey, still got crabs? Not gonna give them to us are you? No way! Shaved and powdered. Not a fucking pubes in sight... Did you shower afterward? First you shower, then you shave, jerk! Then you put the powder on, dickhead! These fucking crabs... Saturday night. How many Hypnostedon did you pop? - Five. - Five? - Got any more? - Nope. All gene. - You greedy bastard! - Fuck you! Half an Hypnostedon is just fine. You're a fucking God! Not fucking five! Dribbling like a freak, man! - And how about Philippos? - He's fucked up. What does he want anyway? New friends? He gave him smack afterward. We did smack together in Salamina. Cool, huh? What's so fucking cool about it? It fucks you up. All fucking droopy. Pills I can handle but smack... nightmare. Shit! How am I supposed to dance without music? - Want a blowback? - Why not? Where do you get this from? Wedding present. We need to have a little talk. Which one of those cocksuckers told you? Nikos. That cocksucker. What did he say? He said you were a... really nice boy. So? They say the same about you, don't they? Fuck you! He stuck his dick up my ass and gave me forty. Not bad for a day's work. Not bad at all... You're a rent boy. You're not a faggot to take it in the ass. Get real! What difference does it make... whether you shag or you're shagged. They'll turn you into a faggot yet... Nikos isn't like the others. What's the matter? Got the hots for him? It can't happen, Panagioti. Never. Once - you're not a queer. Twice - you're a little queer.. - Third time...? - Just fine! Got it in one, right? What about the boss? Does he like you? Yeah. - How much is he paying you? - 150 thou for starters... So what exactly will you be doing? Taking people around. Showing them Athens. What do you know about Athens? A lot more than you. - How are things at home? - Fine. Why do you ask? How come you didn't go to college like your Dad? Don't want to... Come on, you know the score. I couldn't understand shit at school here. I'm not that smart. Let's move on. I've had enough of this. Sure. Why not? Nice haircut... How old are you? Seventeen... almost eighteen. If I try to get away will you beat the shit out of me too? I've never hit a woman. You'll learn. Don't worry... Not again! You go for the black 10 and you get a red 3. It's really fucking with us. It's fucked me, you mean! I stripped Philippos the other day though. Won 100 off him. Way to go! You cleaned out the junkie... - In half an hour I lost it all. - Jerk! - How's it going? - Shit. See you around then. Get lost! Lots of kids around here have left home or have no parents... They're different. Albanians. They left their homes... their country... they're lost. We're not like them. They're real hicks. Listen, Anestis. Some machines pay off... But you gotta have a system, right? How much do you owe? If I sold my ass for the rest of my life... I wouldn't be able to pay it off. I'm sick of doing rent... with those assholes... I can't even speak Greek. Me! A fucking Greek! Anestis. Get off of it. We are Greek. Greeks? We're just Russian Pontians here. And they're right too. How can you be something when you can't speak the language? Why the fuck did our parents bring us here anyway? We were doing OK in Russia weren't we? How do you remember? It's all so long ago... I remember. Believe me. They think I'm a faggot too. But I just hang out with them. - To me they're just... useless. - Tell me about it. Shit I'm really wasted. Forget the drugs and all that shit. What do you mean by useless? - They make me feel sick. - See? It wasn't that hard. - They want you in there. - Who me? Hey, there's a line, man! And after the army? What will you do with your life? I'm gonna do something on my own. I'm gonna be a dancer. - All this is gonna end. - All of it? Ahuh. - Everything OK? - Cool. - What about Natasha? - Fine. No problem. - Have you had her yet? - Sure I have. Right from day one. - How long were you going out with her? - Six months. Her cunt got floppy. No fun fucking a floppy cunt. - What about the money? - Short of cash? No. I can give you an advance if you like. I'm leaving for Patras tonight. I sold my watch yesterday. It was a present from my Dad. - If he finds out, he'll kill me. - Where's your Dad now? - Geneva. - Where? Switzerland. A long way away. I've got to get a job. I'm in deep shit. I owe half a million. Half a million? I keep working and I don't know where the money goes... Want a line? What's up with those RSBs... - What's RSBs? - Rich suburban babes. - Is that what they call them? - Yeah. Look we fuck, right? They're all pretty nuts, too. You're such a jerk! We got big dicks. I fix up the guys. We have a ball. - Do you love me? - Yeah, sure. - Do they all have cars? - Sure. Sometimes two or three. - Expensive, huh? - You bet. GTIs, BMWs... We're talking serious shit. Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil... Amen! Cheers! Look what the cat dragged in! Who told Philippos we'd be here? I did. Why? Is he shagging you? You're fucking right. Then go wipe your ass and get over it. So here you are, huh? I've been looking for you for hours. Did you get lost, you jerk? I told you we'd be here. No sweat, kid. The doctor's here. You look more like a nurse to me... You're a fine one to talk, you fucking little queer... Fuck you! Junkie! Fuck the lot of you! - Good stuff, huh? - Good. - Isn't this where you shagged Psipsina? - Psipsina? Shut the fuck up, man! what are you talking about? - Psipsina? When? - Last summer. You didn't know? Listen Stelio, we didn't tell you so you wouldn't get upset. You mean you all knew? I swear to God I didn't do anything. I'll fuck you, you bastard! Screwing my girlfriend! Give me a break, man! It was just a fuck... One day they're gonna find you in a field or building site... Lying in shit with your eyes wide open... Just hope your folks never find you. Don't worry, kid. I'll just disappear... As if I never existed... get it? I'm gonna be sick... I had this dream last night... Tell us. I was back in Kazakhstan. Outside my old school... with my aunt. She was holding my hand. Suddenly two men appeared out of nowhere... dressed in black. I couldn't see their faces. They started shooting... For no reason... One hit me in the chest... the other in the stomach... I fell... But there was no blood. The wounds were dry. As if the bullets were blanks. But I was dying... really dying. You gotta stop taking so many pills, dude. That shit's messing with your mind. Listen to him! The asshole's trying to drive us nuts. Just one line. A quick snort. It won't do you no harm. Come on. Just a line. I believe in dreams. Listen to this. It's really weird. If you dream of a tree, it's about life. That's a good sign. But if you dream about blood... it means a relative's gonna harm you. - And if there's no blood? - A stranger. Get it? There's more... If you dream about a priest... that's bad. - And if you dream about a man? - A man is the pillar of a household. - It's a good sign. - And a woman? - And if you dream of a woman? - A woman means chaos... Sadness... Sickness. A woman is always bad news. - How are the guys? - Busting my balls, the jerks. - What about your folks? - Shit. My Mom's always on my case. - Nagging me about getting a job. - What does your Dad say? My Dad's dead. Sorry, I had no idea. It's okay. Really... How old are you? Thirty-six. Same age as my Dad. This is a nice place. Yeah... - And you live here all by yourself? - Yes. That's the way I like it. So what do you think of the Russian? Dunno. We'll wait and see. We gotta watch him. He might try and fuck us over. So, boys... What's gonna happen to Natasha? Half of Patras is gonna screw her senseless. - How many can she do a day? - 50-60... More on weekends. But we're talking Athens here. It's different in the sticks. I hear they're crazy about arsefucking in Patras... - That's Pyrgos. - Right... Pyrgos. Yeah, they gag for an arsefuck there. Here we're normal. Those perverts in Pyrgos have given us a bad name... Chill out. Either way, arse costs more than cunt, right? From three grand to ten just like that. Not bad, huh? Well, cheers guys! Here's to business. Half up front. The rest after we get the girl. Deal? Deal. Do you like it? It's great. - What about my body? - Beautiful. - And my back? - Gorgeous. Do you like me? More than... anything else... Make me yours... and everything I earn... you can have it... Could you ever... love? Shall we go for it tonight? That's my man! Now you're talking' What you doing? How the fuck do junkies get off on this shit? I don't get it. If you ever mess with this shit I'll leave you... I mean it. Stop it! That's enough. What do you mean? I'm doing them a favour, man. They can't take this clean shit. One sniff of this and they'll drop dead. Just like fucking cockroaches... - What cockroaches? - Cockroaches that drop dead. - The ad for insect repellent... - Which ad? The little cockroach called Teresa. Got into smack and now she's dead... - We cut the junk in Menidi too. - More cash, right? Cash? No. No, we do it for our mates, Theodora. In case they O.D. Bunch of no hopers. You're pretty cute, you know. - You could go places. - Places? What places? I've got friends. Photographers... and shit. Ever thought about being a model? Do you really think... Me? I could... be a model? Sure you could, babe. - Hello? - Nikos? It's me. Panagioti... Well, well. Surprise, surprise. - Can I come round? - No, I can't. - Tomorrow then? - Listen, Panagioti, don't break my balls. Fucking queer jerk. Check that color, dude! - Good? - Good? Fucking ace! Thai! First class. - Thailand, huh? - Fucking first class. What's all this? What's this shit? Are you sure? I'm not into this... Are we going for it tonight or not? Don't yell at me. Don't yell. Friends? Friends. Sweet dreams, baby... I'm leaving with the clients soon. - All right. - I'll be in Athens by morning. Everything fine? - No problems? - Listen kid, prepare the bride! Tomorrow night the drinks are on me. And remember... not a peep. Got it? Could you ever fall in love? Wow, I had the craziest dreams. Signs and wonders... How about you? How was it for you? Anestis... Still asleep? See how sweet it is? - This traffic's a fucking nightmare. - What do you mean? Pollution, traffic, noise... How can you live with it? It's horrible. It's not that bad. And it's gonna get better, Athens is gonna be hot. I like Athens. I was born there, you know. - You don't say! - That's right, dickhead! A true Athenian! One day my old man decides he wants peace and quiet and we move to Patras. I've lived there all these years and the shithole dump's as fucking boring as ever! - There is one good thing about Patras... - You hear? It's where the boat leaves for Italy! There are nice places in Patras too. Cool bars, cool beaches. Fucking load of shit! - It's not that bad. - What do you mean? Not that bad? Athens, that's what I call civilization! History with fucking knobs on. - All right smart ass, where were you born? - Souhoumi. Souhoumi... And where the fuck's that? It's in the Caucasus. Learn some geography and get a life! Fucking Patras this, Patras that. You bust my balls... Take it easy, guys. We're just chatting. Chill out. Everywhere's just fine so long as there's money. How much are you getting? One fifty. You're cheap. That's a joke. Then again, you had all those free fucks in the bargain! Shit man, you fucked up... When's Giorgo coming back? Me and Giorgo... have split up... Nobody splits up in this business, girl... Could you ever fall in love with a whore? Come on, tell me... Could a male whore ever fall in love with another whore? No. Fuck you, dickhead! We almost had it there... What a fucking life! That's more like it. Hello? Yes? - Theodora? - Daddy? How are you sweetie? Yes? What is it? Do you think you could come back for a while? - Why? - I've got a bit of a problem... A problem? Again? Easy money. That's what you fall in love with. Making money without lifting a finger. All the rest is bullshit. Right? Finally! I thought you'd never answer. Look at that. I used to come here as a kid. With my folks... It's gonna be a nice day. It'd be cool if you were here to see it, too. How about a nice cup of coffee, dude? The fucking jerk... How do you want to go to Menidi, pal? Via Aharnon or Patission? Whatever. Is it far? See it? Over there. On the edge of the city... Am I going to meet your Mum? Yes. And your Dad? Everyone. Don't worry... What language is that? Albanian? - Russian. Why? Got a problem? - No! God forbid I'm no racist! But this country is crawling with foreigners these days. You go to a whorehouse and all you fuck is imported cunt. You want Greek pussy, you gotta mortgage your fucking house. All of a sudden they're all high class hookers. - This country's gone to pot... - What's he saying? Bullshit. Nice cunt. Where'd you find it? What are you doing, man? Are you nuts? I know where he is. - How about letting us in on it? - He's at his Mum's. In Menidi. Don't tell me you're related too? He's just a kid. Only seventeen. Seventeen. Difficult age... They say that in Russia when they catch a faggot... they slash his cheeks a little right here... with a razor... Then they beat the shit out of the poor fucker. Crush his balls... Every time he screams his face splits... until his smile stretches from ear to ear... How horrible! Very backward our Russian friends, aren't they? Very... Why did you bring her here? Speak in Russian. She doesn't understand Greek. - What's your name, dear? - Natasha and my family name... I asked you a question. Why did you bring her here? You don't even know her and you don't like her? It's obvious. She's a whore. You brought a whore into my house? All right, dude... Now what? I want to go back to Athens. Shut up. We'll go soon. Your whole life... Haven't you had enough of this place? What more do you want to see? Can you ever leave a place behind? Or do you carry it with you forever? Sure you can. Without even looking back. Now what? Are we gonna hang out with buddy here? Hey, you jerk! Where've you been? What's up? Forget it. - Who is she? - It's a long story... - Got any gear? - No, I'm going to Karavo... - Why don't you come along? - I'm going into Athens. - Come on. Just for a couple of minutes. - I said forget it. Go down to Karavo, find a cab and bring it here. Don't breathe a word to anybody. Life in the fast lane, huh? Where's Anestis? Have you seen him? - He's disappeared. - What? He's disappeared. Hey chief! What's up? - Bad news. I'm in trouble. - Somebody screw your babe? Fucking machine just took me for ten grand... This early in the morning? Where do you get the money? Sasha gave it to me. For a cab. - Now I've stood him up. - Sasha? Yeah. Haven't seen him for days. Let's go together. - He told me to go alone. - Alone? Look who I found! Whore! - I'll kill you! - Giorgo! Please! Let me go! - Tried to make a fool of me? - Giorgo! You say you believe in God. But when you die... where will you go? Giorgo! Giorgo... My name's Pond. Rosso Pond. My friends call me Sasha.
