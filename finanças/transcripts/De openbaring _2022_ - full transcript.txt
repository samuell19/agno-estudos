Major cities in China have been locked down... due to a new virus that is causing illness and can prove fatal. It is a new variant of the so-called Corona virus. Those infected suffer from fever, tiredness, and have trouble breathing. Experts think the virus originated in animals and transferred to humans. Thousands are in quarantine on a cruise ship in Japan. Forty-one new cases of the Corona virus were found today. It is clear that it happened on a wet market in China. The virus could reach The Netherlands, although experts believe this unlikely. Jacob! Ma. What a surprise. What's all this? Come in, sweetheart. Let's have a cup of coffee first. Have you seen the news? What news? About the virus. In China? Not just in China. It's reached Italy too. Italy? How awful. It's probably already here too. In The Netherlands? Yes. Perhaps even in this street. Of course not. Nothing ever happens here. It's such a quiet street. Well... Now first tell me what your plans are. Why do you have so much stuff with you? I am moving in with you for a while. To take care of you. I don't need help. Not around the house. I am going to make sure you are safe. And stay safe. What do you mean, safe? You will see. When everything breaks down, I want to be with you to guard your bio-security. From now on, you'll stay inside the house. I'll take care of everything. I'll create a shield around us against the great bio-hazard. But... It's the only way. It's the only way for you to stay safe. Dad has just passed away. I couldn't bear to lose you as well. Sweetheart. Dear. That was such a fantastic day. At the prize ceremony, they praised your father's way of skinning animals. He loved that most about the profession, remember? Skinning was an art to him. "It demands technique and calm," he always said. Like woodcarving, you need to find the right place to start. The natural grain of the skin. He didn't see it as anything violent, but like gently undressing the animal. The news. Do you want to watch it? We must. Every day, from now on. It will be carnival soon in the South of the country. Thirty-five. Well done, Ma. Nothing wrong with your head. I am becoming forgetful though. How long are you staying? Until it's safe. What does that mean? You could still be here next month. And your work? Can Mr Meijer miss you for so long? I quit. No, Jacob. You were doing so well. You don't want to... No. I know what I am doing. There are more important things than repairing computers now. But you have to think of yourself, sweetheart. I'm certain Daddy wouldn't agree with this. Does Magda know? She's too busy with her work. It's going to be tough for care homes and old people. I told you. That's why she may have another idea about protecting me... without you quitting your job. No, Ma. You still don't understand. The World Health Organisation is lost. World leaders are making a mess of it, and you think Magda can... And you do understand it all? You going to put a word down? Yes. Damn it. What are you doing? Upgrading your WiFi. It's really important we stay well-connected now. Oh, yes. Well, you're probably right. I'll make breakfast. Egg? Yes, great. We're out of coffee. Remind me to get some when I go to the shop. You're not going shopping. What had we agreed? I can pop to the shop. I said I would do all that. Make a shopping list for me. Are you saying I can't go outside? Unless you want to end up in intensive care. What a horrid thing to say. That is what is happening. Your blood oxygen levels drop. You don't want to risk that. We must stick to the plan. Keep our discipline. Stupid cupboard. I miss him so. Me too, Ma. Yes. It's the small things. Daddy with his toolbox. But now I'm here. Can you find it? Sure. Here it is. Mrs Holtcamp speaking. Hello? Magda! I'm fine. And you? Oh dear. That's terrible. Yes, Jacob mentioned something like that. He keeps me well-informed. What's that? Yes, he's here. To take care of me, he says. I would love that. If it's not too much bother for you. Oh, wait. Jacob wants to speak to you. One moment. Hi, Maggie. I think it's a bad idea. Definitely not. Because you work with all those elderly people. I think it would be irresponsible. I understand, but I am creating a bio-secure environment here. A bio-secure environment. For Ma. You can use Skype, FaceTime, Zoom, whatever. As often and whenever you want. I'll install it all. But no visits as long as the current situation continues. Surely you understand. Trust me, I am taking good care of Ma. That's what counts. Good. Okay. Bye, Maggie. Well... Magda can't visit. It's too dangerous for you and the people she works with. We must protect each other. She knows. But it's Magda. The Corona virus hits the elderly and vulnerable the first and the worst. It's now taking the chance to attack. It wants to infect the whole world. It laughs at our stupidity, and it is continually, as we speak... growing, mutating, evolving, and it will not rest until everyone is sick or dead. This isn't like the year 2000, is it? You thought all the computers would crash. Daddy had to take you to hospital. Ma, you really do not have a clue. Good evening. The Corona virus is spreading. Today's hard wind and rain could not stop the carnival festivities, of course. It is simply careless... We need to realise that it may take months, or even longer... to reach group immunity. What have you seen? Group immunity... I don't know of a speech about group immunity. Put it down in front of the door, please. Yes, just in front of the door. Thank you. Have a nice day. Do we have the right rusk this time? Of course. I forgot the whipped cream. How stupid. Damn. It's my fault. I should have thought of it. Oh well, we'll have to do without. Apple pie without whipped cream is like a Christmas tree without balls. I'll call the supermarket and say they made a mistake. You can't. It wouldn't be honest. I'll take the apple pie out. No, you can't. You've started it now. I'll go to the shop round the corner. Outside? We've never had your apple pie without whipped cream. And we're not going to start now. Can you move forward, sir? A metre and a half is the minimum. Preferably two metres. Can you back up? You could also move forward. What an idiot. Hi. Hey, Magda. Hi. How are you? Are you eating that in front of me? Yes. I can practically smell it. Your apple pie really is the best, Mum. I'll make one for you too soon. Ma. What? Don't worry, I can't visit now anyway. It's such chaos here. Like we're at war. What do you mean? I'm sorry, that's how it feels. Various residents are ill, others are locked in their room. So sad, so lonely. Oh, sweetheart. How awful. Delicious, Ma. Really? You're looking good, Mum. You think? Yes. Your hair looks nice. I can't go to the hairdresser's, so I'm experimenting with my hairdryer. And Jacob ordered hairspray for me. He's taking good care of me. That's great to hear. I need to go. They're waiting for me. Oh dear. Take care of yourself. Yes, I will try. Okay. Look after one another. Bye, Magda. Bye, sweetheart. Bye. Bye-bye. Origins of the pandemic What's this? Why don't you watch television? And I'll go upstairs. First cases of the Corona virus were reported in China. There have now been over 110.000 cases in more than a hundred countries. Demonstrating against racism and police violence. Peaceful demonstrations during the day... face masks will be mandatory. Face masks mandatory on public transport hospital in Breda. Intensive care is getting relatively full. What are you looking at all the time? Long Covid, Ma. That's what I see. Three this morning already. Lung Covid? Covid always affects your lungs, doesn't it? It's English, Ma. Long Covid. There's a lot about it on the internet. People recover from Covid, but the virus doesn't let go. They can't smell anything, the blood flow to their toes stops. They get heart problems, memory loss, depression, and a lot more. And you see it in people walking past? Maybe they're just sombre people. No, it's completely different. I'd recognise them anywhere. Well, I think you spend too much time on your computer. Hi, Jacob. Hi, sis. You're in your room. Where's Mum? She's fine. She's doing a jigsaw. Not the Eiffel Tower again? Yes. It keeps her occupied. Yes. But how are things? I've been doing some research. Research? Here we go again. Come on. The whole world is confused. You need to do your own fact-checking. Provided you consult the right sources. It's about Long Covid. I don't really understand it at all. How come there are so many different symptoms? Funny toes, heart problems. Memory loss. I think, after the illness, something stays in the body. A deeper virus. You're losing me. A virus in a virus? Yes. It's like a serious computer virus. It attaches to an innocent download and embeds itself in your system. You're sounding weird, little brother. Are you getting enough oxygen? You also see them, don't you? People who look like zombies after Corona. The people I see don't even recover. They die. Perhaps they're the lucky ones. Are you nuts? I see them every day in the street. They're lacking something basic. Who says Covid is the cause? Yeah, yeah. I see. You're in denial, just like everyone. Who's in denial? You really need to get more sleep. Staying up on the computer all night is not doing you any good. Remember the millennium, 2000? That was totally different. Don't be so stupid, Magda. Do you realise how lonely I am? I am strong for Ma every day... knowing something horrible is abroad that can kill her in a dreadful way. Of course I understand. It is really scary. I'm confronted by it at work every day. Shall I come visit next week? You know that's impossible. I can stay outside. I want to see you both. Not on a screen. I need to go to Ma. Hang in there, Jacob. Make sure you get more sleep. Mrs Holtcamp speaking. Yes, one moment. Jacob! Jacob! Yes? A call. For me? Yes. Mr Meijer. Don't let him wait. Come on. Hello, Mr Meijer. Yes, that's right. Fine, thank you. My mother too. No, I no longer live there. That's strange. No, everything was still... I don't understand at all. Does anything point to a burglary? Of course you should involve them, if you think a crime has been committed. Let me know if there's anything I can do, Mr Meijer. Bye. What did he say? Nothing important. What was that about a crime? They're missing some stuff. It'll sort itself out. You quit four months ago. Exactly. It's such a mess there. They only discovered it now. This is the real art, Jacob. Don't leave any skin at all attached to the carcass. Think of the skin as a separate organ. Just like the lungs or the kidneys. An independent part of the body. Have you heard of the stories about indigenous people in the wilderness? Boys are only declared men once they have killed a wild animal. When they return, the animal is skinned... and they proudly wear the skin as a cloak. The animal is not discarded after it has been killed. No, it is given a second life. This makes me feel humble, Jacob. This is... beauty, in its purest form. This is God's work... Jacob. You're in a hurry. What is it? We have a Bible, don't we? Of course. Papa's old one. A thick book. Where? Somewhere between the dictionaries. I can't see it. Strange. Why strange? Well... I really can't see it. Perhaps Daddy moved it. What do you mean? Here it is. Here you go. Who's that? A scared white man! It's the Scared White Man. On his way to intensive care? It's a hoax. There is no virus. It's all about power. They want to control you. Don't you get it? Freedom, freedom! No dictatorship! Ma! Jacob, it's so warm in here. Have you gone mad? If a neighbour sneezes, particles can float inside. Fresh air never killed anyone. Infections are going down. The worst is over. The worst is still to come. Look at the Spanish flu. The first wave was a gentle hill, compared to the mountain that followed. The heat's killing me now. There you are. I swore to protect you, so I will. The idea, after what we have been through, of losing you after all, is... Sweetheart, sooner or later you will... Not yet. I can't handle it yet. Daddy has only just... Keep that window shut! Shut, I tell you! Shut! Don't, Jacob. Please. Jacob, don't. Jacob. I'm sorry, Ma. Jacob, Jacob. I'm so scared. Calm down, sweetheart. Everything will be all right. It will be all right. It will be all right, sweetheart. A curfew is in place in nearly forty American cities. More people are still arriving in The Hague. This week, the Outbreak Management Team... "I heard a voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels:" "Pour out the seven vials of the wrath of God upon the earth." "The first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth." "Upon the men which had the mark of the beast... and upon them which worshipped his image, fell a noisome and grievous sore." "And the second angel..." Daddy... I don't have much time, Jacob. I have come to warn you. You need to be strong now. Everything that is happening now is only the beginning. The virus is a psychophagus, it devours your soul. All those poor people you see in the street are empty inside. Or worse, they have already been taken over. That's how Satan builds his army for the Apocalypse. Do you understand, Jacob? Say that you understand. I need to hear that you understand. I understand. Everything is in your hands now. In my hands? But how... I am proud of you, son. Jacob, where are you? Getting a glass of water, Ma. I thought you were talking to someone. Perhaps to myself. Holtcamp. Yes, yes. Hello, Mr Meijer. Everything all right at work? Oh dear. Like I said, everything was still there when I left. Jacob, shall I answer the door? No, I'll go. I am sorry, Mr Meijer, I... If you want to bring in the police, that is your right. I need to go now. Goodbye, Mr Meijer. Who is it? Surprise. Magda, what are you doing here? I said I would drop by. You didn't say when. Couldn't you call? Are we going to talk like this? You should have called first. Just open the door. No. Jacob, who is it? It's all right, Ma. Jacob. Stop it! Who is it? What's going on? I have a surprise for you, Ma. Go to the kitchen. Why aren't you opening the door? Go to the kitchen. God Almighty. Cut it out, Magda. I heard Mum. She's waiting for you at the window in the kitchen. You're really not going to let me in? We take it really seriously here. Incredible. You are exaggerating. She's waiting for you. Okay! Oh, Magda! It's so lovely to see you. And you're looking so well. What? I can't hear you. No. Shall we open the window? This is really weird. Here's Ma. How are you? Not so great. Sweetheart. Yes. That's right. Yes. This is taking it too far. Yes, but... Is work still tough? That was in Italy, wasn't it? You see. I remember now. It was so much fun. Have you finished talking? Mum's going to hang up, I'm afraid. It's nearly lunchtime. Rest and regularity are important. Call first, next time. Let's pick a date... It's your turn. Yes, yes. Yes. With an E, you can extend this word. I only have Ns. Oh. Nothing else? I have about four of them. Then you have other letters too. You can use an A here. Yes, well... An A... Yes, with an A you can. You know what? You win again. I'm going to bed. Don't be so childish. Good night. Feel sick. Throwing fireworks and heavy objects. Of course Magda can come here for Christmas. It's ridiculous. Have they gone crazy? Families are supposed to be together for Christmas. Especially now. You know the infection rate. But surely they can make an exception for Christmas. Magda has no one else. She has plenty of friends. But you want to be with family for Christmas, of course. I'll call Mark Rutte, the slimy creep. He has other things to do. Doesn't he have family? We're all in the same boat. It's just so sad. You can do it. It has to stop. To stop. Coffee, Ma. What is it? I want to ask you something. A big favour. What? I want to go outside. Ma... I know what you want to say. But listen. We have been stuck indoors for months. Now it's getting darker... Who knows how long the Winter will last? Please, Jacob. I really need fresh air, the sun. It provides vitamins, doesn't it? Please, Jacob. To dispel the gloom. It's really important to me. You know how dangerous it is? You've been outside a few times without any problems. I won't ask again this Winter. Or however long this dreadfulness lasts. We can go into the garden. That's not what I mean. Perhaps the small park around the corner. There are some beautiful, old trees. Not those weedy things we have here. Please. Just once. So nice. Right, Ma. Now. Just for a moment. Wonderful. Sweetheart. The smell of pine is the best there is. You've gone all rigid. It's not safe here. We need to leave. We just got here. It's not safe. What do you mean? What's happening? Jacob, what are we doing? What are you doing here? Jacob, she's your sister. You can't just turn up. You should've called first. I called. You called? Just sit down, Jacob. She meant well. It is okay. Mum called because she is worried about you. I am too. You can't just drop in on a vulnerable, older... I can... You should know better. Stop it. I had it weeks ago. Yes. Didn't Mum tell you? So I have antibodies. I am protected. And I am not infectious. But how... Just sit down. We need to talk. Sit down. And you're completely recovered? No symptoms? Well, my smell and taste haven't returned yet, but I feel fine. Jesus. Jacob. We have a delicious apple pie. Have some. Out. Out! Do you mean... Go away, traitor! My own sister! Jacob, stop it. Stop it! Make her go away, Mummy! Quiet. Calm down, calm down. Make her go away, mummy. Make her! Calm now. She is our own Magda. This is getting out of hand. Just go. Come with me. No, never mind. I'll be alright. Okay, I'll call you. I will call. Okay? Yes. Bye, Jacob. Not telling me is the worst. It's so important. We need to be able to trust each other. I didn't want you to worry. Now I'm really worried. Magda said it was safe. That is a big lie. What are you saying? Why would Magda lie? Because she isn't Magda anymore! Hi, Magda. You are probably not home yet? I just wanted to make sure you got home safely. Will you call when you hear this? Great. Bye, sweetheart. Bye, dear. Bye. Jacob... what's happening? The End of the World, Ma. A biscuit crumb went down the wrong way. There. That's better. Are you alright? Yes, absolutely fine. Come on, don't look so anxious. Look, Mum. It must smell deliciously. Such a nuisance, not having any taste. No matter. It's only instant. It's just to nourish you, so you'll soon be... Up and about, and right as rain. Up and about, and right as rain. I was thinking. Shouldn't I take a test? Shall we call a doctor? Why would you? You'd have to go to some huge hall on the edge of town. You're in quarantine anyway. With me. But if it gets worse? Then we'll deal with it. I've got various emergency scenarios. Don't worry. And Magda... I can't get hold of her. I don't understand. The telephone's not working. Really? I'll look at it later. I'll call her too. You know what? When you're better, we'll go to the park. And when we can again, I want to book a holiday to Rome. Is that Magda? Hello? Mr Holtcamp, this is the police. We just want to talk to you about Meijer's Computer Solutions. Why won't you answer the door? Jacob. Mr Holtcamp. Jacob. Jacob! Let go of me! Get off! Let go of me. Don't touch me! Get off. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm only trying to protect you. I am sorry, Ma. Has led to riots. In ten towns the situation got out of hand. In Enschede, for instance. Rioters even tried to break windows of a hospital. In The Hague fires were started in the streets. A police officer had to flee on his motorbike. In Tilburg, cars were set on fire. I promised to always protect you. What's that? What are you mumbling behind me? I love you. I love you. I love you. And one arose from the multitude... to give everything from pure love. His sacrifice has been offered and accepted... because everyone who gives shall be reborn... just as will the sacrifice, which will... And I heard a loud voice in heaven say: "Now have come the salvation..." and the power and the kingdom of our God... "and the authority of his Messiah." "Rejoice. Rejoice." Jacob! Jacob! Jacob!
