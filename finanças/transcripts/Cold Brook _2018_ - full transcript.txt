Let's gather around this one. Come on over. I want to tell you about this exhibit here, which is the Bernadine. Now aboard the Bernadine, these passengers left the Port of New Orleans, headed for New York City. Now, these men and women, they had no idea that they were doomed. But what makes this exhibit so special is the phenomenal condition of the historical pieces that belonged to these people, collected from this one ship wreck. And together they create a perfect snapshot of life in America, just before Civil War would tear it apart. Now remember what we learned last week; the Civil War started in April of 1861. That was one year after Abraham Lincoln was elected President. When seven states in the deep south that supported slavery seceded, forming a new nation. [flickers] What the heck is that? That's job security. Ahh. Are you really? Still working on that? - Yeah. - Come on. All right. - [groaning] - [laughing] How's that workin' out for you? I swear to God I'm gonna hit you with this. [rattles] - [groaning] - [laughs] I just keep catching Blue Gill, I wanna get the Large Mouth Bass. Well, what kind of fisherman do you want to be? Because when I say fisherman, it's "man", what kind of man do you wanna be? - You know? - Yeah, I know. Excuse me ladies and gentlemen, the exhibit will be closing in ten minutes. Ten minutes. Ten minutes from now. Enjoy. The conditions, the sediment on the sea floor, it's incredible, isn't it? Must be the pressure. Hey guys, I don't know if you heard, but we close in ten minutes. This exhibit is wonderful. Well, thank you. Thank you. - We have ten minutes. - Okay. - Well, actually nine. - Let's go over here. I'm sorry. We have eight minutes. But... It's all worms, Wendall. No need for down-riggers, no need to troll, no lures, or the highly overrated chub. - You don't have a chub, do you? - No. If you have a chub... I will karate chop you. - No, I don't. - Okay. It's worms. Fish take the worm every time. What do you have in your backyard? Go home, look in your backyard. Under that little pool. You have worms. You know what? You take off. I'll lock it down. I-I can go? - Yeah man, go. - Ah thanks, Chip. Yeah, sure, sure. Wendall. My locker, on top, July 02. Bongo bass. You take it home. Wow, really? Nah, it was an all you can eat seafood bar. He sat down and he ate shrimp cocktail for like an hour and a half. Wait a minute. You're telling me Junior got comp'd? Yeah. Soup to nuts at the Onondaga. - How does he do that? - Well, you know Junior. He can hang with anybody. Sir? The museum's closed now. You can come back tomorrow. The exit's just right this way. How did Chip miss that? [chuckles] I don't know. Yeah, right-right this way, sir. Right this way. [light bulb clatters] We have contact. Ah, hey, Twinkle Toes. Thanks for the spot? What? You're fine. Anyway, you're done. Come on. Get down. It's time to go home. Let's go, let's go. [footsteps] That's good, Hilde. Hey, I forgot my lunch box. I got it! All right, all right. Did you see Chip's new Mega Flashlight? He says it doubles as a club. [snickers] Hilde... How did he get back in here? Call it in. Oh, hey, this is George Hildebrandt, over here at the, uh, Museum of Art. Put me through to the Campus Police, please. Uh... sir? I'm sorry, Mister, I thought we made it clear the exhibit was closed. Wait a minute... Hey. Hey, you can't go down there! - It's... come on, come on. - I gotta go, gotta go. Thank you, send someone. - Son of a... - God damn it. Where's he goin'? Where's he goin'? I have no idea. That's a dead end. Okay. Hey, mister. Listen... we don't want any trouble, okay? What the... [gasps] Oh, sorry, kids. Didn't mean to scare you. Did you see a man running out that door? - Running, running? - No. - Where the hell did he go? - Come on, he was just here. What's happening? Is he... did he steal something? - What? Uh... I don't know. - Ted, I'm going this way. Okay, I'll meet you out front. - Do you think he's dangerous? - Dange... no. I don't think that... do you live on campus? You all together? Come on. Let's go up the stairs this way. Come on. Come on. Ah, head back to your dorm. If you see anybody along the way just call security, okay? You want me to walk you home? Okay, all right, just, um, head back. Head back, keep an eye out. All right, thank you. Thanks. [music] [panting] Where is he? Hey. Who opened that? - No idea. - Oh, boy. - Ted. - Huh? Go there. - Hey! - [screams] Holy shit. Hilde! [grunts] - Seriously? Seriously?! - Yep. I-I just don't... this actually... [indistinct radio chatter] So, Ted and Hilde, you're goin' after this guy, who goes out through the basement you give chase, then you find the front door compromised, and you come back into the exhibit. - That's right, Chief. - Yep, yep. And Chip... you do not see the man, but yet, somehow you shatter the glass. Am I getting this right? Yes, that's right, Chief. I broke the glass. Okay. Uh, in my 35 years in Law Enforcement, if there's one thing I've learned it's that people don't just disappear. Come on now, let's go find this guy. - Call it in. - Okay, Chief. Consider it done, as soon as I do it. [indistinct radio chatter] [beeps] - All units, we have an adult, black male, African-American suspect. I repeat. An adult, black male. African-American suspect. - Was that Cantonese? - Yeah, um... - Hey... - I'll clean this. - Yeah, we'll get this, Chief. - We'll get this, Chief. - Thank you. - All right, see you later. - Thanks. - Thanks a lot, Chief. - What did he say? - I have no idea. - That's whacked. - Hey, you're the guys! Whoa, whoa. Did you know that you went viral? - We went what? - Viral? You did. You-you went viral. You already have 2,300 views. Did you see a man running - out that door? - Running, running? - No. - Where the hell did he go? - He was right here. - What's happening? Hey, that's a... Can you describe the suspect? Um, uh, and, and you are... Oh, my name is Harold Klebold. Freelance reporter of the on-line Campus Times. Listen, I don't think we're at liberty to... The suspect was black. Uh, oh... It's probably best if you ask the Chief. Can I get your names? - Yeah, uh, Ted Markham. - George... - Ted Markham. - ...Hildebrandt. H-I-L-D-E, BRANDT, with a "D". [laughs] Oh, my God! Look what the sewer backed up. They let you ladies out on a school night? You got the Red Bomb out? Come on, gimme' some of that. I thought you quit? Hey, Chip. Chippie! Come have a beer with us. Ah, no that's, that's a negative. That kinda' crosses that line. What line is that? The line between, uh, who I protect and, uh, who I drink with. Hey, Chip, it's just a beer. Come on. Yeah, yeah. You can protect us while you're having a drink with us. Nah, I-I got... I gotta... I gotta take off. - Chip... - Come on, Chip, it's okay. Yeah. [rock music playing] Okay, wait. Now wait. Is-is it me? 'Cause that-that guy's getting weirder by the day, right? Nah, he just had a bad night. That's all. Yeah, what a night. You're not gonna believe what happened. - I mean... - Ted, whad'ya say? Two? - Minimum. - It's appropriate. - Come on, let's do it. - Lightweights. Let's go. [laughter] [rock music playing] [indistinct chatter] I like your hands. You like my hands? I noticed them. Oh, um... when did that happen? I'm Andie. Thanks for looking out for us. Here ya' go, bud. Thanks, Butch. Did all that just freakin' happen tonight? Right? Was that weird or what? Somethin' else. Goodnight, bro. Yeah. Night, Hilde. [chuckles] [door closes] Wow. [sighs] [music] And that makes for some very interesting news. In Cortland last night a break in at a major exhibition at the college goes viral. Hey Vickie, turn it up! - Quiet everybody! - Ah, it's probably best to... why, do you live in the dorms? - Yeah. - Probably best to just head back home and stick together. If you see anything unusual just, call security or somethin', okay? All right, good. Do you want me to walk you? - No. - Okay, good. You guys should take off. All right, bye! A couple of maintenance workers turned crime stoppers, making these two men our Heroes of the Week. [chuckles] Brave stuff. Well in other news, the Onandagan... Here they... here they come! ...will vote tonight along with the Syracuse City Council of whether or not... - Junior. - Junior! Get those boys some coffee, Vickie. Already on the table. Over-easy, Teddy? Uh, yeah, sure. Comin' right up! Okay, Teddy, this is for you. Hey, hey, hey, Vic, Vic, Vic, Vic? You forget somethin'? [snickers] What? What is it? And this... ...is for your co-worker. [laughter] Listen to this. "The maintenance men gave perilous chase... - Ow. - ..."comma", putting school and student body ahead of their own safety." I read the article. I mean, perilous? Ted, Ted, would you call that perilous chase? I mean, this paper sucks. And you even told the guy how to spell your name with a "D". Oh, I will slap you so hard. Listen, I look good in that thing. Look at that. [music] Oh, hi. - Oh, hi Ted. - She around? I think she's in with the Dean. I'll check. I saw you on the internet. That was great what you did. Thanks. [music] Hey. What are you doing up here? I don't know. Just thought I'd stop by. I didn't see you this morning. Oh, I had an early meeting with the Dean. I would've told you last night, but you were out. Yeah, we, um... did you hear what happened? No. What happened? Thank you for this, Mary Ann. Will I see you at the trustee's meeting? I'll be right down. - Good to see you, Ted. - Yep, yep, see you. You know what, you're busy. I'll, uh, I'll check back with you later. - Ted? - Yep? Very handsome. [telephone ringing] Dean Stoddard's office. You can do whatever you wanna do. Roller derby. Roller derby! [clatters] And I saw him out there, and he just, he just gone. Just... I run up, I reach, I grab him, pull him in. And I was... shakin' and this... and I saw his daddy comin' and then he... and I walk over. I walk him over and he snatch him up. The boy's soppin' wet in his arms. Coughing up water. He look at me and he said, "You will have a piece of your own." "Keep it in da' box, boy. Hear me. You keep it in da' box. Don't let nobody touch it. You keep it safe." That's what he said. Well you was... ah and then-then you... you was there. [music] What're you guys doin'? Chip... the guy who broke in. Yeah? What about him? The-the guy. - The-the guy. - Him. Okay him-him who? Who? Who? Chip, him. You know what, you guys are acting really freakin' weird. And I don't know what game it is, but I'm not playing it. We are under a Orange Level Alert. And it's not funny. It's just... [door creaks opens] [door closes] Ted. How the frick' do we tell who about this? I don't know if we do. What're gonna say? I don't know. He was standing right there. And Chip didn't see him. Nope. He did not. He did not. Ted, he didn't see him. I-I just said that. He did not. Who else doesn't see him? Ted? Yep. Did ya' have fun last night? - I think so. - You know, you left your gate open. I left the gate open, okay. Uh-hmm. You know, I really don't mind you being out late with Hilde. Unscheduled boys night out, whatever. But, it would be really nice if you could keep that pretty good rhythm thing goin'? You know, that thing that we've been doing forever? That little thing where you wake up early and make the coffee, your part of the day? Since I gotta be at work three hours before you do? Ted? [door closes] [sighs] Are you gonna answer me? You didn't really ask me a question. Hey. One short. Yep. Comin' up. One short. Oh, good. Nice. Excuse me. Are you Mr. Hildebrandt? Oh, then you must be Mr. Markham? Yeah, yeah I'm Ted Markham. You have been... What's he want, Ted? Hold on, hold on. You've been cordially invited to the Dean's Dinner and Cocktail Reception. They sent a messenger? Yeah. Nice. Hey, we got invited. [laughs] Hear catch! Go ahead. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [Cody laughs] Sorry. Didn't mean to sneak up on you. Are you nervous? No, no. You look nice. You think? Yeah. I do. I think you're comin' on to me. [laughs] We have ten minutes. We have ten minutes for what? We have to leave in ten minutes. Come on. 18.75, that's 22 bones for you, Mikey.

She told me to stay away from you. Let's blow this pop stand and go to a motel room? It's not Prom night. Did we ever make it to the Prom? [laughs] I love you. [indistinct chatter] [applause] Thank you, Dean Harver. Thank you. Thank you for your words... Thank you for your words that always inspire and also make us laugh. And now, it is a privilege to introduce two men who have become local heroes. It is rare when curiosity and courage conquer fear, to truly serve and protect the college and the community. Thank you. Thank you for watching over and maintaining the foundation of our beloved campus. And you keep the lights on.

Come on, let's get a beer. I can't... Hilde? I'm kinda' freaked out right now. How can we help you? There was this old dog on the farm. He used to chase 'dis chicken around every day. Would not stop chasin' that chicken. Then one day... that old dog chased the chicken clear into this chicken coop, with all them chickens and... I don't know what happened in there to that old dog, but he ain't never chased them chickens no more. Were you waiting for us? Yes, sir. Yes. I'm not sure I understand. Le Deux. What? Gil Le Deux is me. [music] Here you go, buddy. Wow. 108 people died on that ship. That's a lot of people. What's that, a program from upstairs? Yeah. You think he's upstairs again? What'd you say? No, no. The man, Gil. You think he's upstairs again? Hmm. "This Exhibit contains a Passenger Manifest with a complete list of the Bernadine's passengers and crew, boarded at the Port of New Orleans on February 23rd, 1857". Hey. There he is. Oh hey, Chip. We have leads. What? We have some very interesting leads. Oh, well... That's great. [car engine starts] He's gone. Let's go. [music] You don't think there's an alarm attached to this thing, do ya? Oh, good time to ask. [opens] Be careful. No. Not there. - Come on, turn the page. - Okay. Bernard Macon. Coralee Devant. Gil... [car approaching] Wanna go to the Brook? That's what I'm thinkin' about. Me, too. [scoffs] What'cha lookin' at, Mom? [clicks tongue] Oh, nothin', I just... I thought I saw your dad coming home. Alright. [music] Do you remember? Yes, sir I... Now I, I remember I was on the deck, and-and a wind come in with so much rain that even, even the ocean couldn't hold it. And then, then the waves come. The water was... was filling up all over the place. And it was so dark, and it push against you so hard. I just couldn't reach it, I... Reach what? I saved his boy. - Yeah... - Who's boy? I-I did. Couldn't swim a lick, that boy, and then, and I wasn't going to let him hit no bottom. No sir, I wasn't gonna let that happen to him. I remember I, I grabbed him, pulled him on out and I, and when I got him out I could see Master Ribeaux running across the field, and he just grab him out of my arms, just take him and squeeze him up, he wet and cryin', and then... and then the Master look, he look right at me. He said, "Thank you, Gil" Master said, "Thank you, Gil." And then... then he told me, he said... "Listen here, boy. I can't free you... open. Not here." And so he give me a piece of my own. He-he give me a place for me and my Coralee. Coralee? Coralee. Yes sir, that's my wife. She was on the boat, too. She was. Do you know that you died on that boat? That what I did? [music] Over here. Hi. Hey. What are you doin' over there? Just sittin'. Okay. You comin' to bed? Can I ask you something? Yeah, you can ask me anything. What's going on, Hilde? What's going on with what? Come on, I know my husband. Rach... Don't Rach me. I've 30 years with you, we've never had a secret. I haven't had any. Listen... You're my best friend. Best friends share everything. I miss mine. [music] - Hey. - Oh, hey. You out already? Yeah. I, uh... I got bagels, coffee's on. - I gotta go. - Do, um... See you later. Uh, hmm. What's up? Why so early? I think it's a deed. What's a deed? I went to the Museum last night. Here, you drive. Wait, wait, you went where when? You know that display case? The one with the box, the one that Gil was talking to? In that box, - is the deed to his land. - Wait, slow down. What box? What land? Remember how Gil was saying something about his master giving him what was his? - A piece of his own? - Yeah. Yeah, well the deed to his own is in that box. Come on, I'll tell you. [car engine revving] Um, it-it appears to be a legal document. It's got a seal. It says New York. I figured if anyone knew it would be the County Clerk. And-and these numbers right here. All those numbers right there were on it. And, uh, the name Gil Le Deux. Gotta be a record of it somewhere, right? Well, there might be. Just maybe not here. Like I said, it's really difficult without having the actual deed in hand. Not a lot of information here. It's like asking me to identify an octopus... without it's legs. I... I'm sorry. I can't find a match, with this information. Thanks for your time. Have a nice day. Just-just follow me on this, maybe it wasn't recorded, maybe the transfer of the land, or the legal whatever, never took place. I mean, think about it. Right? He never got there. Somebody's gotta' own it, right? Absolutely. Well, that's what I'm say... Holy shit. What's he doin' there? Look who it is, the dynamic duo. Where you been? Holy Mother and Saints, if it ain't the disappearing act. Hey guys. Hilde, they got your good side. [laughter] That's pretty good. Come on, beers later! No can do, but soon, right? Okay. You just play Keith and Mick. Leave me here with the drummer. Hey, Gil. What're you looking at? Do you know that's my wife? [music] [waves crashing] Coralee! Grab me! Coralee! Grab me! - Please! - Help! Coralee! [screams] Coralee! [phone ringing] Hello. Yep. Yep, okay. Uh, hmm. Alright, yeah, yeah. I'll-I'll be right there. Alright. Who was that? School. So late? Yeah. Something at the uh... Art Museum. I don't know. Want me to come with you? No, I got it. I got it. Come on, it'd be like back before Cody was born. Was there ever a time before Cody? Yeah. There was. I gotta go. - Ted? - Yep? Did you see me in the Tea Shop? Yeah. I did. [door closes] Oh, boy. Oh, boy is right. Never saw lights do that before. [car engine revving] Holy cow. What are you doin' here? Um, I got a call. You got a call? Yeah, they-they called Ted. What time... what time did they... What time did they... did they call? A little while ago. We should check the main breaker. Right? - Okay. Yeah. - Yeah, we really... we're gonna check the main breaker. - Yeah. - Okay. - See ya' later. - Yeah. You know what we're gonna' do? We're gonna lock this place down. We're gonna sweep it. We got a 482. - We got a what? - We got... Give me the mic. Base, we've got a 482. We got a what? We got an electrical incident. Who is this? This is Senior Sergeant Ostrowski. What're you doin' there, Chip? I was... I was... I heard the call and I was available. Uh, oh, okay. Okay, so we are securing the area and we will advise.

You're gonna be late. Worst day of my life. And many more to come, dear. Ted? Would you come here for a second? I gotta show you something. What is happening with him? Oh, man, I don't know. He's just in that funny place right now. Yeah. I guess he is. I just... He's 15. Uh-hmm. How about us do you think? What place are we in? We're just right here. Just you and me. Oh, don't... What? Ah, yeah. You weren't supposed to see that. Wow. You showed up with five friends. [laughs] Hey, I showed. And we were all so high. And I looked over at you and you were wearing that sweater that I knitted. And-and it wasn't perfect. Which was kinda' perfect. I gotta go. - Go. - Okay. - Go. - Okay. Cody! Right there. Oh, wow. That's where he was. Wow. I'm lookin' at him and he's... I don't know what he's doing, he looked back at me - for a second. - I know. I bet, I bet. I don't know what to... [water gushing] Y'all know where home is. Look, she would join me, she... she would look at me like... like I musta' done somethin' wrong and then... then she smiles... Yeah. She'd smile... I know she'd do that. But I don't know where that is. How she gonna find me... if I ain't there? Huh? Gil I-I don't know how to help you. I wants home. Did you hear what he said, Ted? He was talking about his wife. I know, I know. It's-it's like he's aimlessly walking the earth. I... Wait a minute. Wait. What if it's not aimless? Oh, man. - What? - Oh man, Ted, what if he doesn't leave? What if Gil just stays right here, right? I mean, we just saw him in the backyard, right? Where-where we gonna find him next? Like, hanging out in the kids' room? No, no I don't want him in the kid's room. Ah man, this is really happening. All of it. And I'm feelin' all this stuff that we can't really share with anybody. I mean, it's incredible. And it makes me feel like we're special, in some way, or crazy. But whatever it is, it's just you and me. And we don't even know why. Why? He needs to go home. [car engine revving] Are we just gonna take it? Like, we're gonna steal it? No, we're gonna borrow it. The clerk said to have the actual deed in hand. So, let's do that, right? Let's give him that. I don't think he meant it literally. Oh, shoot. What're you doin'? Look. Who is that? I can't tell. Is that Chip? Oh, shit. [car engine starts and revs] Alright. Oh, boy. You sure about this? No. No, I am not. Hey, Ted. What if we run into someone, or somebody sees us? If they do, we're just fixing the electrical. I'm not sure needing an alibi is a good thing. Oh, look at that baby. Hello! Get the... Don't touch him. You don't know what kind of spider that is. [music] Is it clear? Yeah, yeah. Come on, come on. [music] - Really? Really? - I know, I know. [music] Come on. [music] Ted. What? I can't make the guy out, but he's still standing there. Well, still keep looking at him, okay? Okay. Hurry up. - Hilde. - Yeah. Come here. You gotta see this. Look. For Gil. That's his land. Yeah. Shh. Listen. Next time we do this, make more noise. I know. I'm telling you, no one is gonna know that that deed is not in that pouch. - Hey, hey, hey. - What? Did we leave our light on? No. I come back here tonight, 'cause I figure that if, you know... something could go wrong, and it did, and maybe it could happen again, and I wanted to go that extra mile. For the job. For the sake of making sure that everything is gonna be all right. I mean, he may be out there... but he's not gonna be in here. No sirree, no Bob, no. Not on my watch. So, I post one of my guys outside the front door. And guess what I saw. I saw our local heroes. Which makes me wonder. Did you get another call? Was there another "electrical incident" and so they called you guys? - Chip... - You guys are maintenance. You maintain things. I'm supposed to be security, but apparently I don't secure much of anything. I thought you guys were taking it to 11... but really... all you were really doing was taking. Wait. Chip. It's just an old a deed, to a piece of land, and we just need to borrow it for a short time. That's it. And then we're gonna put it back. But what does it have to do with you? You know what? Listen. I don't know what you guys are gonna do with that thing, you know what, I don't wanna know. But I'm gonna give you one day. That's it. 24 hours. And then you're gonna bring it back to me. - You're gonna give it to me. - You got it. Okay. Me only, okay? - Yeah. - Yep. [music] [vacuum whirring] - Oh. Hey, Sweetie. - Hey. I can't believe you slept there all night. - I tried to wake you up. - I know. You didn't wake up. - Hi. - You didn't wake up when the girls left. Oh no, I know. - Hey, Rach. - Oh, God. - I thought you were downstairs. - Sorry, uh... I just, uh, need to take those papers to work. - Didn't want to forget 'em. - What is this? Uh, it's an old map. Um, can I have it? Don't, but, don't-don't- don't bend it like that, Rach. It's a hundred and fifty years old. What are you doing with it then? Just give it to me? Please. Okay. The man? That we were chasing in the Museum that night? Uh-huh. That's him. - What's him? Who's him? - The-the black guy. - That everyone's looking for. - But you just said it's a hundred and fifty years old. I know it's crazy. I just want to help him get back home, and then I'll take it back to the museum. You took this from the museum? From the college where you work? Do you know what's gonna happen when they find this missing? - You'll lose your job. - I'm not gonna lose my job. You would put this family, this place, everything we eek out for a living at risk? Nothing's gonna be at risk. Really? You sure about that? Ted? Yeah? Where's your girlfriend going so early? Uh... can you help me clean up a little bit? I gotta... Go. Okay. What'd you have in mind for that? I was gonna put it back. Okay. Did you tell Rachel? Ah, no. Is it worth it, Ted? Is it worth it? I don't know, Hilde, but I'll tell you somethin'. If it doesn't work out, or we don't find Gil or his land by tonight... we're gonna bring that back, we're gonna give it to Chip, the exhibit reopens, nobody's the wiser, and nobody... is gonna get hurt by it. If we get caught, we lose our jobs. If we get caught, we're goin' to jail. [laughs] Oh, come on. You think this is funny? No. No, I... I don't. Hilde. I do not think that Chip is gonna tell anybody. We're the closest thing he has to friends. I know that sounds pathetic, but it's true. We've got to do this. Why? I don't know. But when's the last time you felt like this? I just can't shake this sense I have that he's here, right now. Not just because he's lost. Yeah, but I really think he is lost. Yeah, but we ain't. Everything was fine, Ted. And then Gil shows up and everything is different with Rachel. And I guess everything is different with me, I mean, I don't know. I don't know if I'm ready to be different. What? That was good. - Stop it. - It was. - It's not funny. - Hey, I'm serious. It was good. [music] Are we really gonna do this? Yeah. [phone ringing] Dean Stoddard's office. Hey, Mary Ann, it's Rachel. Hey, Rach, what's up? Hey, do you know what's going on with the boys? Um, I can't say that I do, no. About what they took from the Museum?

This... it really should be in a museum. Can you tell by looking at it, um, who might own this property now? Hmm. Let me... look at something. I may have it here. It should be right here but it's not, um... if it was unclaimed property, then the Transfer of Ownership may have never taken place. What were the names associated with this? Ribeux and, uh, Gil Le Deux. Here. Here it is. - Wow, oh wow. - Right here. He found it, he found it. "Ribeux" owned it for a very short time. And apparently, this Gil Le Deux fellow never claimed his land. And the County sold it at auction in 1878 to a... Theodore Maxwell Markham. - That's why he's here. - That's why it's us. [music] Not here. Nope. Come on. [music] - Gil! - Hey, Gil! Gil! [music] [birds chirping] Hilde. - What? - Hilde, come here. Come here. What? Right there. See the rock?

Uh, yeah, yeah, it's me, Mare. Ted, I'm gonna check the basement. What's goin' on, Ted? I just got a call from Chief Baumgartner. Did you tell her? Did she tell you about the man? - About the... - Yeah. I told her. Okay, okay. Um... he's here. What are you saying? What are you telling me? I'm telling you that he's here, right now, in the house. He wasn't down there, Ted. He's not down... - oh. - Oh, for God sakes, you see him, too? It's okay, Rach. What do you see, Ted? He's sitting on the bottom step. Um... waiting. [music] Mare, someday soon I'm gonna be able to tell you about everything. And I can't wait. But until that day, what I can tell you is that he's real. And he wants... no, he needs to go home.

According to Sergeant Chip Ostrowski of the Woodbury College Campus Police, there was never an African-American man breaking into that exhibit at the Art Museum on campus. Why do you think they did it? Well, who really understands criminal behavior? A demented cry for attention? It's sad really. We're just gonna have to face the music. - I know. - It's gonna be okay. I mean, other than the fact Rach is gonna kill me. It's a major embarrassment for Mary Ann and the college. That's never good. But hey, we got our pension. Yeah, buddy, I'm not so sure about that pension. [laughing] If you could back up the clock, would you change a thing? No. I would not. Okay then. [siren blaring] [music] Hey, Ted.
