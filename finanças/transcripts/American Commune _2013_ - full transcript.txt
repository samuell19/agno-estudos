You guys want to get together in a little bit more of a group so I can kinda... Let's actually maybe get you guys facing this way. And do you think this party is gonna be hot? Oh, for sure, definitely. Can you say that? Like, "I think this party is gonna be so hot." This party's gonna be so hot. Is her party gonna be, like, the event of the year or what? Oh, definitely. Best party of the year, no question. Do you tell people at MTV that we're from the farm? No, I don't tell anyone that I'm from the farm in New York. You're from a commune? Like, that just means free-loving, crazy hippies running around naked or something. I just feel like where we came from in our childhood is just so... different. And I almost don't really know how to present it to the world. My sister rena and I work for MTV, and as far as anyone knows, we're just two girls from the city. For years, we've kept our past a secret. But I've started to wonder about that part of my childhood. We left the commune in 1985 and haven't been back since. Approaching destination. Pink delicious. Must beautify. We're gonna be on the farm all, like, doing our makeup. All the, like, old farm ladies are gonna be, like, "what are you doing? You're beautiful already, honey." "These would be banned from the farm back in the day... You narcissistic... person." Why are you so nervous? I don't know, I just feel, like, that... It's gonna bring up a lot of emotional issues, being where we all, you know, first came from, when we were all together before. I think it's because that time was so innocent, and good, and so much has happened. I mean, life has happened. Remember? Airy? Yep. This is what we called "the head of the roads." It's where all the roads meet on the farm. It's incredible. Let me sit. Wow. ♪ Om love is real, god is real. What you do matters, what you think matters. So, like, if a group of people get together and be really, honestly straight with one another, they get into a high-energy flow. And whatever they do will prosper... you know? That's where it's at, man. Attention is energy, just like "e" equals mc squared, and each one of you can have control over your attention. Yeah, this was one of the houses that we lived in. It's crazy. Wow. It's like everyone just left in the middle of dinner or something. Oh, my gosh. I totally remember eating out of these kind of bowls. Do you remember this? These wooden bowls? These are so '70s. What were you eating? Most likely soybeans. Okay, so for a long time, we didn't have TV on the farm. But once we did get TV, it was probably something like this... A black-and-white 8-inch zenith. Nice... that's right. And you weren't allowed to watch the commercials. Yeah. Between, like, five and eight families would live in one house, and they were just packed to the gills with people. Everyone would, like, sit down together for a big dinner, and you'd have these huge tables, and everyone would sit around the table. I don't know, I think it was... It was definitely intensive, and it was hard to keep the houses going. But I also think, you know, we lived day-in, day-out with these people. You know, mothers would nurse each other's babies. Other parents would take care of you. And so, they kind of became your family. It looks like this was, like, an old pantry or something. Each house would usually have a garden, but we didn't buy anything. We didn't have money on the farm, so we would go to the store and get our rations. And I remember as a kid, I would go to the store and get, like, 40 rations of sugar, which was probably, like, a quarter of a cup per person, per week or something, when we had it. What are you guys doing with the house? We're destroying this, and piecing it apart, and then throwing it into the dumpster. And then, we're gonna take apart the flooring right here. Is this one of the last sort of old farmhouses left? This is it. There isn't another one, I don't think. I didn't expect to recognize anyone at the reunion and was surprised when a few people remembered my name. Hundreds had come from all over the country for the week-long gathering. I couldn't help but wonder if they, too, felt disjointed from their past. When I was, like, 13, I hadn't been here in hella long, and my mom comes up, and she's all like, "I want to introduce you to a good friend of mine." And we go up, and we meet this lady, and she's all, "this is, like, Marjorie or someone, who's all... She breast-fed you for a long time." I'm, like, "hi. This is, like, the weirdest way to get introduced to someone." It's, like, nice to meet you, whoever... Again. I tell people about when I found a gum wrapper on the ground, and I smelled it for a week until the smell went away... Because I could never have the gum. It was... the smell was the best I could get from the wrapper. And that's how... That's how wanting I was of... Of out there, of sweets, of anything besides soybeans and tortillas. I've never wanted to go back to the farm before, and I've actually had massive aversion to any kind of, like, farm gathering, pretty much, for, um... Yeah, quite a while. I didn't understand why, but I hated my parents and I hated the whole hippie thing. I think I felt a lot of shame around it too. We used to grow stuff in all these fields. This whole field was Kale. Can you believe it? And we ate it all too. We either planted it by hand, we planted it by horse, or planted it by tractor. We cultivated it, we weeded it. Were you in the fields a lot? We hoed it... yep. I hoed cucumbers. I could see cucumbers when I closed my eyes. And when I went to sleep, I could see cucumbers. The plants, I mean, I just... They were imprinted on my mind. Wow. We worked so hard. Here we were, college kids. Nobody knew how to do anything. And you know, we just knew what we knew from school. But we really started building a town from scratch. That took a tremendous amount of work. I mean, nobody knew... Who knew where water came from when they were growing up? You know, you turn on the faucet, you live in the city. Who knew where a tomato... You buy a tomato in the market. I mean, we did every single thing from scratch. We were willing to work really, really hard because it was something that we wanted to do, that we really cared about. Like, we had a bigger mission in mind. And so everything that we did was, like, tinged with this bigger... bigger mission. We wanted to do things to change the world and the quality of people's relationships. These are family photos of when I was a teenager. There's your grandma. Here's me and your grandma on vacation. Looks like Palm Springs. We used to vacation in Palm Springs. Looks like it's probably a Friday night, a shabbas dinner or... maybe a holiday. And, um, it looks like there's a challah on the table. ♪ Each time ♪ there's a wish to be made ♪ ♪ a wish for you and me I was raised in a Jewish conservative home, just on the outskirts of Beverly Hills in what was called the trousdale estates. My dad was an orthopedic surgeon, and he became the chief of surgery at cedars-sinai and became very, very successful. And my mom, she was the first one to go to college in her family. ♪ There's a wish to be made they were immigrants, so they were new in this country, and they had come with nothing. And they built up, and they built up, and they built up. Education was always extremely important in my family. They probably didn't think that I was gonna drop out, and become a hippie, and move to a commune. I think that was probably the farthest from their mind. My mom left UC Berkeley and started hanging out in the haight. My dad had just finished a four-year stint in the Navy. The details of how they met are a little murky, but it had something to do with a vw Van and a holy man jam. This is where I worked from. We landed here... Until about '80-something. '82. Anybody do any oil changes around here? Yeah. J.b. How's it going? Hermano, hey. Como esta? How you doing? Good.good. Here's the deal... The only person who could really fix a vehicle at the time was Joseph, or even willing to. They pulled off a lot of miraculous stuff. They kept what buses we had going. They kept what cars we had going. And we didn't have... And we didn't have nothing to work with, man. Not even a battery charger. We had a just... You know, instead of going to the store and buying the part, we took the part and fixed it. We came with the spirit. We was gonna try to make it work, and that was from the heart. We trusted each other down to the bone. We had super trust. Everybody had trust. So that was, like, the love that kept us together. I was born in Puerto Rico, 1944, way up in the rainforest. I was there 'til eight. Then, my parents packed us up, all five kids, and we went to the Bronx. The word was that, you know, come to america, and there's money on trees, you know, the whole immigrant thing. My mom worked in the garment industry, and my dad worked as a Mason. He was, you know, very macho. What he says goes. I would be counting my days when I could get the hell out of there. Why did you go to San Francisco? We just did... You know, free love, and a lot of women. And we were, like, 24, so we said, "hey, that's where we gotta go." I had a tape recorder a lot like this, and I carried that thing into every meeting for the longest time, you know, my big, old tape recorder. I don't know how to get into this guy. I think we got it. Yeah... all right, we got it. It's cooking. To have enough juice to be heavy in the manifestations for a while. It's Stephen talking. Yeah. How much free will you have depends on how honest and sane you are. And the more honest and the more sane you are, the more free will you can have. Because your attention is like a spotlight that magnifies everything it touches. And anything you put your attention on gets bigger, and stronger, and prospers. And what you're supposed to do in the world is go around and dig groovy stuff so it will prosper and grow. We found this guy, Steve Gaskin, and he was teaching a class in a church in San Francisco, Monday night class. I walked into the room at my first class... Packed, wall to wall. And I had this strange feeling that everybody could read my mind. Stephen was talking about the experiences we were having collectively on acid, on LSD. And so, he had practical ideas about how will you change your life. He had his finger on the pulse of what was going on with this alternative culture. In 1970, Stephen's Monday night class attracted 1,500 hippies every week. What we really need a lot more of is grass, and trees, and that kind of thing because the concrete and the cities, just the logistics of keeping a city together, calls for a higher degree of order than is good for the human organism. Huh? You understand that? When you first met Stephen in Monday night class, what did you think of him? Well, I just thought he was really interesting. Stephen really became a teacher for me because he was making sense of all the scary stuff that was happening. And it made sense not only to me, but to a thousand other people that were listening to him. We weren't happy with what was going on in our society. We really hated it, and we really wanted to make a better world than the one that was available to us. The thing about going and doing a farming thing is that if you put yourself at a subsistence level of farming, you can step outside of the conceptual society and exist in a relationship with the earth, in which case you're not adding anything to the machine. There isn't any large beatnik commune that has made it yet in the country, you know. And, like, if I can get a large one to make it, it'll be a pretty fair trip. It's a strange caravan, 25 old school buses repainted and remodeled to house a communal group which left San Francisco on Columbus day to discover america. The group's guru is an ex-marine named Stephen, who founded the commune after claiming revelations during an LSD trip. Our parents were among the 300 hippies who set out to find land to start a commune. ♪ Keep your head up high ♪ rest your mind at ease ♪ don't let nothing get you down ♪ ♪ 'cause everything's all right ♪ ♪ I can't believe in ♪ or sing a sad song ♪ you know ♪ you get what you need ♪ it all comes around ♪ he just can't get you wrong ♪ ♪ you make it all as you see ♪ So here's what's left of the caravan. They all had different names on it too. The mantigua bus, or the bus from stockton. I used to know 'em 'cause I used to work on them all the time on the caravan. You knew every single bus? I knew every single bus. Kept 'em running. Check this out, this one had a skylight. Someone actually lived in this bus? Yeah. It's cozy. So, Jose, did you find the bus that you came on? I thought you came in the bread bus. No, it's called a cracker truck. Oh, a cracker truck. We used to live in it. Bread bus, cracker truck. There's a difference. What's a cracker truck? It's a truck that had crackers... It used to deliver crackers, and the name on it was still there. Cracker? Yeah. Yeah, and we called it the cracker truck. The caravan was going through southern California, and we decided to stop in L.A. and see your... You know, your grandparents. That was the first time I met 'em. They took a look at me and said, "oh, my god. What has she done now?" They were really strict, so they told us, you know, we couldn't sleep in the same room 'cause we were not married. So, we just said, "okay, we'll just see you later." So we just took off. Why did you even go on this caravan? Because when we were traveling in a caravan, we kind of bonded into a community. Believe it or not, we bonded, and we kinda dug hanging out with each other. And it was a lot of fun hanging out with your friends. So it was only natural of us to find a place so we could do the same thing, but not being on the road. We were just basically having a good time, living our dream. As these modern gypsies prepare to swing through the south, some are growing tired of life on the road. They speak longingly of getting farms, building cabins, and growing what they need to eat. The leaders say they'll find the land through vibrations. When the vibes get good, that's where they'll stay. The prospect of 300 hippies descending on a small town ordinarily might frighten many of the local residents. But with the hippie caravan that traveled recently from San Francisco to Nashville, there was a difference. These were people who'd gathered together to preach the virtues of Jesus Christ. After seven months on the road, the group bought 1,750 acres in summertown, Tennessee. They called their new commune "the farm." ♪ There's nothing like the feeling ♪ It was in the heart of the Bible belt, and only 20 miles from where the ku klux klan was founded. ♪ Be anyone you can do what you want ♪ The immoral life that they live is the only thing that bothers me, for I am a Christian myself. And I try to live right, and I just don't believe in that way of living. They want to live that way, that's up to them. But, well, I can't see for the life of me how they gonna make a living on that place down there. ♪ A lot of miles to go ♪ and there's a lot of folks that know ♪ ♪ a lot of places I'd like to show my face on ♪ ♪ a lot of long nights ♪ a lot of hard fights we had some money because we all pitched in our savings, and inheritances, and everything else. We were able to pay for the farm with cash. We wanted to be farmers. I don't think I ever did, but we thought that farming was cool. We thought, "well, that's what we should be doing." ♪ There's no time to waste ♪ no, no ♪ no time to waste ♪ no, no ♪ there's no time to waste it would be hard to imagine a much more difficult place for a new commune of young people with no training in farming to begin. The young people don't eat meat or anything that comes from animals, like milk or eggs. They arrived with some apprehension. Nobody was sure how the local farmers would take it. People came in and told us what's the time of year to plant everything, and what kind of stuff grows good up here. And people that know this piece of ground for 50 years come up and tell us what they used to grow up these hollows, and just really friendly and a lot of cooperation. Were you surprised with this reaction? Not really because we be honest people, and we don't be a hassle to anybody, and we work pretty hard at that. And we feel, just like it says in the Bible, that as you sow, so you shall reap. What was your first memory of seeing them come to town? Well... Yeah! ♪ As you read this letter that I write to you ♪ ♪ sweetheart, I hope you'll understand ♪ ♪ that you're the only one I love ♪ ♪ please forgive me if you can ♪ ♪ sweetheart, I beg you to come home tonight ♪ ♪ I'm so blue and all alone ♪ I promise that I'll treat you right ♪ ♪ love, oh, love, oh, please come home ♪ The newcomers set up makeshift housing. Some were in buses, others in army tents. Our parents made their home in this teepee. ♪ And the fire is burning low ♪ the snow has covered up the ground ♪ ♪ your baby's hungry, sick, and cold ♪ We thought we would make it by the seat of our pants. Somehow, some way, we would survive. The first cash crop that we planted was sorghum. We were going to make sorghum syrup, which was a big thing in the south. I think we even had a name for it, "old beatnik sorghum" or something like that. We got all the equipment, and grew the sorghum, and harvested it, and, well, we had a huge crop. That first year, everybody was out hacking down the sorghum. It was a deal, I'll tell you. But it wasn't quite as easy as I think we'd imagined it would be. I mean, we were just as green as we could be about how to survive in the Tennessee Woods. But I think it was an absolute incredible determination to make it. I mean, there was no question in our minds we were gonna make it, whatever it took. Can you kind of tell me what this sort of life is about to somebody who doesn't know, and... Well, it's a life that... It seems like most of the thing that we do that's really heavy is tell each other the truth. And we live with our neighbors in a kind of a close thing where it's important to be truthful with one another. You think that the sense of community is stronger out here than it is in most urban settings? Oh, yeah. You know, when you were five, your parents didn't have this kind of a future in mind for you. But if it's... It's fulfilling to you then? Yeah, it really is, it's very fulfilling. Howdy. Hey, guys. So what is it like here now? Um, we're not a commune. As you probably know, we're an intentional community. But we're not, like, socialists anymore. We have our own money, and we pay dues. And we have a... yeah. There's about 200 people here instead of 1,400 or whatever it was, and, you know, people have jobs, and their own houses, and their own cars and electricity, which is cool. And it is really different, for sure, and I'm okay with that. Although there's some things that are hippie, but, like, I wouldn't have moved to the old farm, personally. Why not? I don't know. Give up everything, toss in with a bunch of other crazy people. You know, take a vow of poverty? That's crazy. The vow of poverty is kind of semi-hidden. I don't know if some... I consider them my rare and... Important rare documents. "Vows of poverty and residency." "We are organized on a communal basis according to the book of acts of the new testament." Our criteria was if you want to become a member of the community, you gotta put everything you have in the pot. And we're doing this for a lifetime, for the rest of your life, and we're all gonna take care of each other. So that's the... That was the basic eye-to-eye, telepathic agreement that we had. So what do you think those vows of poverty... What do they symbolize to you now? They're... they're... Anyone that lived here, that actually came here and said, "I believe in this thing, and I gave up everything, and I was here righteously, for however long I was here," you know, this is evidence of it. And that those are the members of what I consider the church, our group consciousness, our tribe. I would say that 99.9% of the people that signed this vow of poverty and were here really believed it was gonna be lifetime. Do you see our parents' vows? Hale... Let's see, mcclintock... Mcgurk, Meltzer... Moss... are we gonna get mundo, moss... If we couldn't find a vow of poverty for your mother or father, we would... People would say, "they were here. They qualify." ♪ Ooh what we had on the farm were called agreements. Some of the first ones were that we didn't eat meat. We'd say we didn't eat anything that you could look them in the eye. We didn't eat dairy. We gave up wearing jewelry, makeup. We didn't drink alcohol. Also, we didn't believe in violence to the point of, anger is a form of violence. So you weren't allowed to be angry on the farm? We weren't allowed to be angry, and I thought that influenced a lot of relationships, because we could have some emotions and not others. So where was anybody... I mean, I know now, more. How or where was anybody gonna express their anger or their frustration? And Stephen was our spiritual teacher. So if you were there, your agreement was that you would accept him as your spiritual teacher. It was almost like we were asking him to be like a Solomon, you know, to be like a judge in a certain way or justice, and give his unbiased type opinion, but then also based on what he saw as our teacher and guide. And that's what people liked him for because he would say the truth as he saw it. Yeah. When I found I like to do marriages, I started, like... Gonna write a ceremony. I said, "why do marriages now with a whole lot of ceremony?" So I started, like, trying to say what would cover the ground that I wanted to cover, the contract I wanted to make between the people. And then, I started reducing that to the simplest language I could, and it just comes out to, like, better for worse, richer for poorer, sickness and in health. Isn't that a cool picture? That was at Stephen's house. We went and visited when Miguel was about a week old. Oh, really? Yeah. You know, it was special to go see him and be invited out to his house. Well, you know, that's the interesting... Comes to an interesting juncture. Why? I think... I think I'll talk to you about it after dinner. Why? What's the... well, why don't we... Why don't you shut off the camera, and then, I'll talk to you about it? And then, you can turn it back on if we decide I will. Why? What are you afraid to talk about? Because I just want you to. Don't... come on, Nadine. But why? No, but it doesn't work like that. What's... I just asked you a simple question. It's not a simple answer. When we got to the farm, word went out to give up our birth control pills, 'cause it wasn't safe, 'cause it's chemicals. And I immediately got pregnant. Stephen used to have a saying. If you're balling, you're engaged, and if you were pregnant, you're married. So was that a rule? Yeah, that was one of our tenets, I'd say, by Stephen. I didn't quite know what to do. The relationship was pretty new, we weren't married, and I think even then, Jose and I had problems where I wasn't sure if he was really the one for me. I felt very alone, like I... I didn't feel like I could be pregnant, being there on my own, alone. So I made a decision to stay with Jose, and get married, and have the baby. When me and Jose got married, my parents did come to the farm, and they came to our wedding. My mom sent me a dress, it was this little gingham... Kinda like a little straight hippie dress, and Stephen married us on a hillside. And, uh... we were stoned on mushrooms, and one of the things he said to us was, "psychedelic vow-takers." So then, after the ceremony, we sat on the floor of the teepee and greeted people that came over to wish us well. And so, my parents sat and kind of were, I think, trying to figure it all out. ♪ Treat each other right you could tell that they were trying to understand what the heck we were doing in the middle of the woods in Tennessee. ♪ When we ♪ go inside it's funny 'cause, like, no matter what kind of family you come from, no matter how dysfunctional it is, you still idealize that first family. You know? It, like, seems perfect, even though it wasn't perfect. But it just seems like it was, like, the happy times. But I don't ever remember them being happy. I've always wanted to kinda go back to that time. And I think in that, I've always kind of wondered if it actually existed. So how many kids were born into your parents' group marriage? With the entire four-marriage, I have four sisters and two brothers. But I am the only product of my mom and dad. From my understanding, it's by... By sharing the person that you are totally committed to and most in love with... With somebody else, you are totally letting go and becoming unattached. And that opens you up to be a more enlightened person, I guess. It didn't work at all. I mean, they fought all the time, and there was tons of jealousy and competition, and there still is with my dads. During the birth, I guess there was some kind of tension going on. And so, Stephen came in and told both of them they were on ego trips. And they had to leave, and they were kicked out, and he basically took over the male role over the birthing. So they didn't get to see me for the first three months that I was born. I've just noticed, like, the kids that came out of the four-marriages definitely had a harder time figuring out who they were, and what they were doing, and what their place was in the world. I remember my parents getting up at dawn to attend Stephen's Sunday services with the rest of the farm. I could hear them "om" through the woods. They were seeking spiritual elevation, and it was often very serious, but it didn't always make sense to us kids. There ain't gonna be a bunch of folks on the farm that, uh... That just say, "okay, you know, I'm enlightened, and you be enlightened tomorrow," when, you know... There ain't no end category like that. It's just always... It's just always happening. What Stephen found out was, like, oh, he could teach folks, like, what it took to get enlightened and like, what it takes to, like, be real, and responsible, and be realized. Stephen was really special. He's, like, really tall, and, like, he kinda sticks out, very tall and skinny. I would see him, like, walking down the road, and people were, like, crowded around him, but he was very separate at the same time, and it was, like, he had this omnipresence, like with god, you know, where, like, you don't necessarily see a god, or you don't know what they look like, or you don't talk to them directly, but they're kind of always there. People have fallen out of step with mainline societies almost forever, almost since there have been mainline societies. Mm-hmm. And very few of them have survived. Why? What makes this one different? Well, the thing about that, when you say very few of them have survived is I think you leave. You think very few of them have survived because you only think of the ones that didn't make it. But, like, I can think of a couple of small, kind of family operations that began in the beginning that are still making it that we call by names like the United States of america and Rome, to name a couple. The thing about revolution is change, not violence, or hurting anybody, or blowing anything up, it's change, that's what it's about. And how about just up and changing? You know, and doing it, and doing a new thing, and we're doing a new thing. And, uh... We really love it. Well, good morning out there, farm. It's 25 past 7:00, and time to pick ourselves up, and let's boogie. This is wutz-fm, 88.3. By the late '70s, the farm became a self-sustaining community, pioneering organic farming, vegetarianism, and solar power. ♪ Out on the highway ♪ in the west Texas sun ♪ I didn't want to leave you now ♪ The construction and farming crews brought in cash, while everybody else worked service jobs on the commune. They embraced new technology and even created a handheld geiger counter. More than 500 kids attended the farm's state-certified school. One of the reasons that there's folks on the planet that's hungry is because we use our resources uneconomically. So we have learned how to make soymilk, and we make 50 gallons of soymilk a day, 5 days a week. Most folks saw that we were having a good time, that we were serious now, that we believed in what we were doing, and that we had good-looking kids, good, healthy, you know, pink-cheeked, happy kids, and they liked that part of it. You know, my... my folks in particular liked all of that stuff, but what they didn't like was that we didn't have our name on one piece of it, you know, that we couldn't say that this one acre we could sell if we ever wanted to, you know, 'cause we just put it all into the pot. ♪ But if we wait until tomorrow ♪ We got to do what we wanted to. We don't have to work for the man. Nobody could come and mess with us, you know? We were living off the land, and we had our own place. This is ours, this is home. So we're... you know, we loved it, you know? Everybody felt the same way. We had a commitment, everybody, that we're gonna try to really work hard and make this work. ♪ Well, I'm making up ♪ yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm making up ♪ ♪ hey, hey, hey, I'm making up ♪ ♪ making up for lost time ♪ making up for lost time ♪ making up for lost time Do you ever wonder where have all the flower children gone now that the '60s have passed into history? Well, Robin young caught up with a group of them who took root and flourished. Let's see how big this baby's getting to be now. Ina may Gaskin is Steve's wife, and she's also the farm's head midwife. With the help of a doctor, ina may learned and then taught others spiritual midwifery, a no-drugs, at-home birth method. The clinic also has a standard policy. If any woman is healthy and needs help, the farm midwives will give her free care and delivery. And if she doesn't feel she can keep the child, they will. My sister, brother, and I were born at home with midwives, as were thousands of other babies. I can only imagine the courage my mom must have had. The farm midwives became renowned for their low caesarian birthrates and their book, "spiritual midwifery," became an international sensation. Childbirth is a spiritual event and one of those peak experiences that it depends a whole lot on how you're treated. If you're treated well, you're gonna have a good flavor from that that will last you a lifetime, and it really affects your relationship with that kid. Did you guys have any kind of training initially, or was... No, nothing, nothing. That's what's, I think so... I mean, I had a master's degree in English, if that counts. I'd never seen a birth, but I knew I hadn't also had my common sense removed, mm-hmm. And I just couldn't be persuaded that there was something intrinsically wrong with humans that made 'em so they had to have babies in hospitals. So how many babies were born on the farm? Or how many babies did you deliver? Oh, about 2,300 or so. In the beginning, I put them in this book, and this book's full. But there's a lot of memories from every one of these births, and I probably had some part in the prenatal care of every one of these women and assisted at the birth of many, many of them. Am I in there? Um, give me your date. July 19th. Here you are. Were you at my birth? No, I wasn't. Do you know who was? Mm-hmm, yeah, Leslie Noona, mm-hmm. Oh, wow. Yeah. ♪ There ain't nobody gonna turn me around ♪ ♪ turn me around turn me around ♪ We would sing, like, all of these, like, freedom songs, like Martin Luther King freedom songs at school. And, you know, mom was a schoolteacher for a while, and we were instilled with the idea that it was our responsibility to grow up and change the world, and make the world a better place. We were taught all the normal subjects in school, but there was this emphasis on world politics, the environment, and equality, you know, that we are all equal beings on this planet and one segment of the population shouldn't hoard all of the resources. ♪ Can you... I think it's impossible to really entirely escape that. Like, that gets into your psyche. And it just kind of felt like it was on our shoulders, to make a difference. I remember my brother having "star wars" figures and them taking the guns off the figures before the kids could play with them. And really remembering that and thinking about that. Now, why are they doing that? Why is that so important? Because they don't even want us to play with guns. They don't even want us to play war because if you can play war, then you can participate in war. And I remember having lots of conversations with my parents at a pretty young age, you know, seven, eight, nine, and talking about this stuff, talking about why are there nuclear weapons? What's gonna happen in our world? Being in fourth grade and staying up all night with my best friend crying because there could be a nuclear war. And I don't know how many fourth-graders were doing that at that point, but we were. I think this was, like, one of my birthday parties. ♪ Frere Jacques ♪ frere Jacques everybody, like, sang happy birthday and stuff, but I remember being so embarrassed, like, oh, my god, like, there was so much attention on me. And then, I just remember, like, running out and crying. We weren't supposed to, like, stand out, you know? Like, there was like, the big saying. Like, don't be a little "juice," which basically meant, like, you know, don't try to get attention. Don't be, like, in the energy, the collective energy. And I think I just remember being told that so much as a kid. Like, we all were told that. So the moment that I got, like, attention from the entire group, I think it just felt like I wasn't supposed to be getting attention or something, even though it was my birthday. As a kid, I think you want to, like, be complimented. You want to be, like, affirmed that what you're doing is right, or that it's good, or that it's special 'cause you don't know who you are yet. It was kind of cool, you know, to be able to wake up every morning and walk to school through the woods. It was a big adventure. Our parents didn't worry that we were gonna get kidnapped on our way to school or that we would get run over by a truck. There was just really very little here that would ever harm you. Take a bunch of deep breaths. Just store the good air. I wish we could bottle it. Yeah. Once you're out here, you realize that you really miss it. But without coming here, you kinda forget about it. Maybe I'll miss it more now. You don't really miss something unless you kinda know the value of it. I was born down here on dogwood Lane in a school bus. Like, this is where we originally parked, I guess, and, um, I was born there, yeah. It's kind of a nice spot to come into the world. I guess it just kind of feels like I grew up in another country. And money is always a weird thing for me too, just 'cause we didn't have money for a big percentage of the time. It's just, I don't have a huge value in money. It's, like, people, and my... The quality of my daily life means so much more to me than having a big stockpile of money in the bank. I guess that's something that I definitely got from the farm. Like, it was just the genuineness, like, being, like, straight-up, looking people in the eyes, and, like, really being genuine, and saying how you really feel, you know? And it's, like, when I find people that are that way, like, it's, like, "oh, my god." Like, I want to hang out with people like that, you know? And I know I got that from the farm. Do you think it's a pretty special place to grow up, the farm? It's... it's really special. It's, like, one big family, and everybody's your brother. A lot more peaceful too, anyway, you know. Yeah, I think the religion is really not going to services. It's really what your heart feels about taking care of people, and, you know, everybody is equal, and everybody should get a fair shake in the world. Tonight at the school at 8:00, come on out for the farm high school music program. ♪ We are the kids ♪ I wish that I could say ♪ ♪ we don't want no nukes ♪ coming our way ♪ and we want to live... Whether the farm is a good place to grow up really depends upon the standards used to judge it. Young people who are growing up here tell us they like it. By their standards, it is the larger society that they have grown up to distrust. ♪ Hey, we don't want no nukes ♪ ♪ ooh, we don't want a meltdown ♪ We are tragically heartbroken by the vision of the world that we see. And the only thing we think we can... to do that can ease your heart is to get out and see what you can do to help it get better. The farm created a humanitarian organization called plenty and started doing relief work around the world. Within a few years, plenty had free clinics, an ambulance service, soy dairies, and nutrition programs in Belize, Guatemala, Africa, Bangladesh, Washington D.C., and the South Bronx. Our parents went on plenty's first mission to Guatemala. The first things we did, we sent food, 50,000 bushels of grains and stuff. And then, they started bringing us... They thought we were medical because we could do medical stuff, and they just brought us these dying babies, just break your heart. So we built a soy dairy. We'd been eating soybeans all along, and so we started just feeding the kids down in Guatemala what we were eating, and the mothers could see the kids improve and start fatting up. It made a tremendous difference in the quality of life for about 2,000 or 3,000, 4,000 people. ♪ The bomb ♪ for love of the sky ♪ the bomb ♪ for love of the sky by 1980, the farm became the largest commune in america, with 1,500 permanent members and 10,000 visitors a year. ♪ Tell all the people not to be content ♪ ♪ tell all the people we ran around in huge kid herds, and I remember never wanting the day to end. ♪ Look out for the bomb ♪ the bomb ♪ who's got the bomb ♪ there's proliferation in every major nation ♪ ♪ the boy scouts are the next in line ♪ State troopers began leaving the Murray county airport around 12:17 this morning en route to the farm in summertown, Tennessee to find out whether or not a marijuana crop was actually growing. Accompanying the squad cars was the thp helicopter, piloted by Mike Dover, who says earlier in the day on Thursday, he spotted at least 15 acres of marijuana growing in a field. There was a big raid on the farm... Right, right, right. Scores of law enforcement agents, tbi agents with helicopters, trucks. So what'd they find out there? It was a melon field. How much did it bother you that they came on the farm and did that? What I really didn't like was can you put one person's name on a search warrant and walk into 120 different households? Tennessee law enforcement had mistaken a field of ragweed for marijuana. After the raid, the farm filed a freedom of information act request and learned that the FBI had been investigating them for over a decade. This is a typical FBI file... One of many. You can go and find pictures taken by infiltrators, FBI agents who were living on the farm, presumably dressed as hippies, taking photos, and those photos appear in the files. "This communication is classified in its entirety." What were the different investigations? We see at least ten discrete periods of investigation. They investigated us in our plenty office in Ottawa, Canada and Washington D.C., where we had a free clinic, New York City, where we had an ambulance service, several satellite farms that were around the country in that time, and, of course, a massive investigation here in Tennessee into all of our connections. What are the grounds for us being a threat to national security? They considered us a risk. And how they come to that determination is not something that they needed to ever share with us. We didn't know why suddenly our loans were being called in, why we were having to roll over into higher and higher interest rates, and why we were having to refinance loans that we had long lines of credit secured by land, secured by property, secured by businesses. Big lines of credit, and yet suddenly, they were now being called into question. Didn't know why. We'd had perfect payment records. Didn't know why we were suddenly being told, "we can't loan you any more money." They blacked out all the names of all the bankers and anybody else they might have talked to. Finances were tight, but the farm continued to keep its gates open, and provide food, shelter, and services to anyone who wanted to live there. How many here would like to live in a commune? What do you think? Good idea? I enjoy my privacy. Who wants to spend their life with 20 other people? In other words, there's no privacy in a commune. Well, as far as I know. All right. Can anyone come live on your farm? Could I come there with my family? Yeah, you don't have... You don't have to have any kind of money, or degrees, or rich, or anything like that, just as long as you're minimally nice. Does she have to turn over any money that she has? If she doesn't, the internal revenue service will bust her for using an illegal tax shelter. Why? Everybody who comes to the gate, be fair to the other members of the farm, and doesn't... What is unfair about her $10,000 checking... Savings account if she's not using it and wearing fur coats in the farm? What's fair about her walking into our free medical care, our free... our free services across the board. But why is that money any of your business? Wait a minute! Don't... They told me when I left the farm don't let that so-and-so interrupt you. That's what they said when I left the farm. They called me a so-and-so? No, it was worse! Wait a minute. Because if she joins our commune, we, collective, spiritual community, we are going to take care of her. If she gets hurt seriously and her doctor bill goes out into thousands, and thousands, and thousands of dollars, we are going to take care of her. So is this the old bank? Like, the farm bank office? This is the old bank. And people would come and say, "my kids need shoes, my kids need this," and there'd be a list for everything. "My kids need medicine." Some of the lists were higher up, you know, more important than others. And of course, those things came first. And most of the time, we didn't have any money for any of it. What everybody was saying was, "there's not enough," you know? "There's not enough food, there's not enough vegetables, there's not enough diapers, there's not enough shoes." It was all things that the children needed. It wasn't that people weren't working, but they were working at things that didn't generate income. Every problem went back to money. And we went to Stephen, and we said, "every problem goes back to money. "We have to come up with a way... To bring in some capital ." And, um... It was a fight from then on because he didn't really understand, and we didn't really understand where he was coming from, I guess. We tried to be very innovative about how to take care of all these people, but it was an open gate, and more people came to the farm needing than giving, and you can't sustain a community on that. You just can't, so when people'd come to the gate, it was, like... At first, it was, like, "oh, we'll take care of you, come on. "You know, we'll deliver your babies. You know, come stay at my house, I'll feed you." And it was such a generosity of spirit going on in the early days. And then, when you find yourself not feeling that way, like, "oh, my god," you know, "12 more people came in the gate" and all that, you know? You... you... You don't like yourself. And you think, "well, this isn't "what I originally started out to do here, so the dream has gone a bit awry." I don't know what the complaint is about the farm standard of living. Some people think if you haven't got asphalt roads that you're not civilized. But we have hot, running water in the house. And to be middle-class on a worldwide standard, according to United Nations figures, is running water in the house, not hot. It's just so hard to live here 'cause you can't generate anything, you know? It's all getting sucked into the big pie, but you don't get nothing back. I mean, sure, it was a good place to live, and raise kids, and stuff, but you gotta be able to buy diapers and underwear, and fix your house up a little bit 'cause you know, they were shacks, you know? And there's just nothing in 'em, you know? And cardboard outside and stuff, and people get tired of that. Farm residents were living below the poverty line on a dollar a day per person. Fruit and vegetables were scarce. There was a skinny kids list for kids that were underweight. People began depending on outside family members to send care packages to supplement our meager diet. The major political difference on the farm was between people who felt like the most important thing for us to do as a community now is improve our standard of living for our children, for ourselves, but also to be a model, and to be something we're proud of, and to succeed through that. And the second division was people who felt like it's more important that the farm outreaches outside of our community, spreading the word, sending out Stephen to talk, publishing books to be sold to talk about the farm. Looking at you, first of all, say, "oh, they're a bunch of hippies, "and they're living, you know, the sinful life on a commune." Oh, it ain't sinful to be a hippie. It's very moral to be a hippie. The world needs... I was just telling them down in Tennessee that we don't want to be the majority party or anything, but we are a vitamin without which this world does not prosper well. That's very well-put. And I knew at that time what was going to happen. I knew at that time at the next Sunday service, Stephen would make it to be a religious issue, and he would say the gates should be open because it's part of our religion to always let people in. I got on, I said, "as a community, "we have no relevance, we have no model, "we have nothing to teach the rest of the world "unless we improve our standard of living "and make it be something else that someone likes to live. "And Stephen, I think it is wrong for you to basically use religion to control us in that sense." He argued for a minute, and then he was dead silent and never gave a response other than saying he was gonna call off service. All right, good morning, god bless you. We were getting into our more adult years. We were in our late 20s by now. We had kids, we had families. We were making our own decisions, and we reached the point where we said we didn't need that structure. And I think it was difficult for Stephen to maintain purity, too. I could see that he was becoming as dependent on his students as some of his students were on him, that he needed their affirmation to reinforce his ideas... And his concept of himself. It was a hard, hard time. In 1983, the farm was on the verge of bankruptcy and was about to lose the land. The board of directors declared that the commune would de-collectivize. In order to stay on the farm, members would have to earn money elsewhere and pay dues. The board ousted Stephen and took over governing. So the board decided that there was gonna be... That people were going to have to pay dues? Yes. it wasn't Stephen's decision. No, not Stephen's decision. Stephen was totally against it. Why? It wasn't... it wasn't... That's not utopia, you know, to have to go earn money. I wished it could have worked. We cried a lot at the board meetings because it was, like... It was so close... And you ha... You were powerless. You were powerless. And you could see it all slipping away. It was like, musical chairs at the time. Like, wherever you ended up at that time is what you got. And so after, you know, working so hard there for 15 years, we ended up in this really, really leaky, cold trailer that would, like, pour water in down the wood stove pipe. And then, we had to pay rent, which we hadn't... Didn't have to do before. And so, there were monthly fees. So, I got a job at a local neighbor, cleaning house for $15 a day. And so, you know, as a founding member... When the changeover happened... There were big votes about what was gonna happen to the community, that if you weren't paid up on your dues, you couldn't vote. And I remember saying, "I don't understand "why I can't have a say-so in this, "and why I can't vote "because these are really difficult times for me "and I feel that I should be able to. I've been here forever." And that was just, like... It was a firm "no." And so, um, something then... clicked. Like, it... it's time to move on. As kids, we were used to sharing everything. If there was food around, you could always eat it. But suddenly, property and food was divided amongst individual families. The rules had changed on us, and at the time, we had no idea why. You know, when we first got divorced, divorce wasn't allowed on the farm. Like, it was really, really frowned on. I kind of had to take a stand for that 'cause I knew things just weren't working. It's always been really uncomfortable. I've always been kind of envious of people who had good relationships with their exes afterward because it's so much easier on the kids. But, you know, around graduations or times when we would come together, the big family milestones, and... It just has always felt very strained and polarized. What? What? Just remembering about the divorce and...? I think our family's just had so much, um... turmoil, like, since you guys got the divorce. And it's been a long time... That we could all actually be together, like, just in the same room, you know? You know, we spent 13 years together, you know? It was crazy, we were living in the same... You know, the same place, but it's hard to live with somebody where there's no love, there's no expression of their feelings. You know, it's like, "I love you, honey," you know? There's no heart, you know? She had me backed down where I couldn't do nothing right, you know? But I tried to please and not say nothing, so I was backed in there. I didn't know how to express my feelings, my deep, deep... coming from my heart, you know? I was finally fed up with this. It's... I can't take it no more. I'm... I'm outta here. The cards gonna fall where they fall. I can't do this, I'm... I'm just flapping in the breeze. Do you remember when Jose and mom first got divorced and separated? I remember me and my dad leaving. I felt lost. I think a lot... Like, "where are we going? What do we do next?" And didn't know what was going on. Plus, I was, like, I didn't have you guys, I didn't have my mom. And my dad said ever since then, I had, like, nervous habits. Like, I would bite my fingernails and do things like that. So I know that was a hard time for me, definitely a really hard time. Yeah, and very painful. Even, like, thinking about it now, it's painful. Yeah. I just feel like there were so many rules on the farm that there wasn't a lot of room for being an individual. I don't know, maybe I, like, wanted to believe that, like, they were happy or that they actually loved each other, but maybe they never really did. And, like, that's sort of the catch-22 of the farm, is, like, they were so invested in changing the world. And it was almost like... The self was sacrificed. Like, personal relationships were sort of, like, secondary to that mission. And, like, that is sort of maybe the underbelly of what we were born into. Between 1983 and 1985, hundreds of families left the farm in a mass exodus. Our family split up. Rena and I left with our mom. Our dad remarried and moved to Florida with our brother. I was only nine, but I knew that the farm was falling apart and would never be the same. We packed up the station wagon, and drove across country, and then landed in Santa Monica. Stayed with my grandparents. It was very extreme, from rural Tennessee to, like, luxury apartment building overlooking Santa Monica beaches. Moving off the farm and moving to L.A. Was, like, moving from a different country. ♪ Barbie makeup fun you know, on the farm, no one wore make-up, no one wore jewelry, no one wore perfume. ♪ Bubblicious has the ultimate flavor ♪ All of the social rules were totally different. The culture, the things that we ate, the things that we talked about. I remember the first time I went to school off the farm... I pledge allegiance to the flag... Everybody turns and faces the back of the class. They start reciting this weird chant. I just, like, stood up, and faced the teacher, and, like, put my... the wrong hand on my chest, whatever. I just didn't know what was going on. I was, like, I do not understand the social code out here. We were so embarrassed and desperate to fit in, we didn't tell anyone about the commune. Rena and I straightened our curly hair because even that seemed too hippie. Within a couple of years, we had completely buried our past. Oh! Oh! ♪ The chills that you spill ♪ up my back keep me filled ♪ with satisfaction when we're done ♪ ♪ satisfaction of what's to come ♪ ♪ I couldn't ask for another ♪ ♪ no, I couldn't ask for another ♪ My Sci-Fi soap opera's on now, "Babylon 5." In it, these guys are on an outpost, and earth is turning fascist on them. How stunning! Ah! He has become one with his inner self! He's passed out. That too. Stephen lives on the farm in the same house that was built for him over 30 years ago. I had a pit of fear in my stomach when I walked into his house. In my mind, he was still the omnipotent authority figure, and I was just as afraid as when I was a kid. But I knew I had to see the man who had such an influence on my past. Ina may must have put all these pictures up like this because what we all did together was so wild, it's almost hard to believe it if you don't see the evidence. Do you have any regrets? I've done things that I didn't like having done, that I had to just really get down and tell myself where it was at for a while until I got where I could stand myself again. What do you mean? Like what? Oh, just things where I did not keep up to my own standards of stuff, where I did stuff that I thought was cheap, or bad, or, you know, unfaithful to my vows. But I don't like the way it went down. I was down in the Caribbean on the plenty project, and there was a coup while I was gone. And I was personally trashed for a bit. I confronted people... Hundreds, thousands. What was that period like for you? It was like grief. That's what it was like. You know, because of the stuff that I and we had all worked for so hard, for so long, a lot of it got trashed right then. Was there ever a point during that changeover that you considered leaving yourself, and... No.why did you stay? No. This is where my friends are, it's where my home is. It's where I put, you know, about 15 years of my strongest middle years of life into. And I'll tell you... This is something I realized later on. I realized that I had been blessed with being able to do a few heavy labors in my life. One was Monday night class. One was the caravan. One was starting the farm. One was starting plenty. I didn't know what the last one was for a long time. Then I realized, it was to not get stunk out and to stay here. Hello. Um, my name is Genevieve Perkins, and, um... I'm just so grateful to be here. And, um... It's just... It's really profound for me because... I held a huge grudge against this place for a long time. And just coming here, I was just, like, it's so validating to know where I come from, and to know these are all the people, these are all my family. Hi, I'm Nadine mundo. After we left the farm... I always remembered feeling like I never had a hometown... Sort of always spread out. And I always... I just always felt like a nomad. Yeah. I feel like I've gotten to know people that... I guess they knew me when I was young, and we probably played together. And I feel just reconnected to the land and to all the moms... The surrogate moms that I feel here, even if I don't really know them. Sort of, you get a hug or a smile, and it's, "oh, okay, they have my back." And there's just this sort of familiarity that has been gained again. I feel changed by coming here. For the longest time, I've been ashamed of my past. But now, I guess I don't feel like I have to hide it anymore. What more could I ask for than to feel more whole? It also made me have more compassion for my parents, just knowing that their intentions were good. Three months after returning from the farm reunion, I'm rushed to the hospital with extreme abdominal pain. You have a cancer that's awful, and all we're doing is trying to address that cancer. So you have to have a little warrior mentality about this. Okay? So, don't worry. At 28 years old, I'm diagnosed with colon cancer. There's no history of it in my family, and I've always been healthy. All right, you're gonna be fine, you're in good hands. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My parents haven't been in the same room together for over 20 years. As I'm wheeled into surgery, I look up, not knowing if I'll see them again. Maybe they'll never make amends, but seeing them stand together for me was a moment of grace. My surgery is successful. The tumor was removed and hadn't spread. I have no health insurance. Unexpectedly, I receive over 200 cards and checks from former commune members that amount to $10,000. "Dear Nadine, you may not remember me, "but I used to live with you on the farm and my oldest daughter was friends with rena." You remember that? "Anyhow, my thoughts are with you at this time. "I thought you may need a little change. Love Kim," I think, "Schneider." "Since hearing of your struggle against the big "c" "up there in New York, I've thought of you constantly. "You're young, strong, "and full of the will to fight it, "and I know you will. "We are with you in spirit, "with all our love, and faith, and optimism "that you will grow strong again "and get back to your life. "You have important work to do, "and I know you'll be back at it soon. "With all my love and best wishes, Phil. Phil schweitzer." People have come out of the woodwork in such an amazing way. It's so incredible, and overwhelming, and amazing, you know? Yeah. And even though the farm is no longer a commune, there's still this community of people that takes care of each other. ♪ We could sail ♪ down to la Havana overnight ♪ ♪ watch a new day dawn in one place ♪ ♪ where they try to make things right ♪ ♪ and we'll skip down crumbling highways ♪ ♪ inside sun rays ♪ rising through the veins ♪ of angel leaves and jungle haze ♪ ♪ so open up those great big ♪ ♪ orbs of astral blue ♪ play me a song I never knew ♪ ♪ And there's no limit ♪ to the shit that we could do ♪ ♪ we'll trip with shamans in Peru ♪ ♪ and we'll fly above ♪ the surface of the sun ♪ golden waves of fire ♪ turning in the current ♪ of the one ♪ and we'll fumble tumbling ♪ soft, and warm, and young ♪ chant for it, we'll be coming ♪ ♪ undulating equilibrium ♪ So open up those great big ♪ ♪ orbs of astral blue ♪ play me a song I never knew ♪ ♪ like you do ♪ and there's no limit ♪ to the shit that we could do ♪ ♪ we'll trip with shamans in Peru ♪ ♪ in Peru ♪ We could sail down ♪ to la Havana overnight ♪ watch a new day dawn in one place ♪ ♪ where they try to make things right ♪ ♪ and we'll skip down crumbling highways ♪ ♪ inside sun rays ♪ rising through the veins ♪ of angel leaves and jungle haze ♪ ♪ so open up those great big ♪ ♪ orbs of astral blue ♪ play me a song I never knew ♪ ♪ like you do ♪
