You've been peeking during your prayer Such a sensual body and smooth skin This is the best car for those with a pride to match A beautiful and sexy wife who listens to you Wouldn't that be fantastic? I prefer a lover than a wife She can be both a wife and a lover She'd be attracting attention. But you'll be the only one she wants Scientific and initial investigation are key to every case. You need to explore all the options you have Explore all the options! - You must use your head! - Use your head Are you laughing? How can you laugh at a time like this? Anyway, try to organize the facts in a scientific way! Yes, Sir. We don't have the murder weapon yet There's a high chance that a kitchen utensil was used So I've requested the forensic lab to investigate them We're looking the crime as both incidental or calculated revenge Keeping both options open, we're investigating possible suspects around the victim. What else? We've come to a conclusion that... the murderer is female - A woman! - Yes How did you find that out? That's great work. Well done! In any case, you are fools if you can't figure this one out. I'm sure the criminal's face was caught on the security cameras Narrow them down, one by one. Get to it! Move it! Come on!

Thank you. So the dead woman and my husband knew each other? Yes. So what? Excuse me? You're still single, right? Yes You'll find out when you get married, but being married is like that. It's not perfect Well, you know, lady... Can you recall where you were last Friday between 11 to 12:30 am? I was here in my office Oh, honey. You have company What are you doing here instead of going after the criminals? This is an invasion of privacy Please don't misunderstand. This is all part of the investigation You can call it what you want I even played golf with your Commissioner last weekend You shouldn't hassle me like this Okay You can leave now I'll buy you dinner some time I know you're working hard on this case Much of the plaster ended up in her airway and gullet So the death was instant And there was much struggle, as there are evident marks on her neck, shoulders, and stomach And there are fingernail marks... Fingernail marks! That proves that the killer is female The last murder was committed by a woman. And so was this one! Don't you feel the connection? What connection? Oh, you're too dull Anyway, what did you want us to see? It's Princess Aurora How's the ride? It feels good I want to drive on forever... Until we reach the Pacific Ocean The Pacific Ocean? I can't go that far I really hate it here. I really hate it This place makes me sad. It makes me unhappy I want to get away from this place But, surely you must overcome that You're right. I need to do that I wish I could go somewhere and get drunk tonight Are you okay? We're at my palace right now The palace of blessing and happiness We can understand each other because we're alike We share the same sorrow and unhappiness Our unhappy marriage and sad lives But we'll be happy one day. Right? Get with it. You're ruining the mood You're right. I should't do that - What's this? - It'll help you sober up. ? How do you feel? Are you better now? I know how dad feels now When he said that life is lonely I heard his sad voice as he whispered in my sleep Did you say that we share the same feelings? We're totally different, you son of a bitch Listen to this before you die Isn't her voice pretty? This was my happiness On the murder scene of both CHOI Shin-ok and NA Jae-keun, the same sticker was found on the bodies The killer is exposing her identity It was hard to link these murders to the department store killing But there was something that we had overlooked Look here I was oblivious of this fact during the initial investigation I've come to the conclusion that all 3 cases are the acts of a single killer. They all involve a child That's all What's the link between the department store victim and these ones? For instance, did the two women know each other? We cannot find the link as of yet Well, let's organize a special team to focus on this case And please take extra precaution when you talk to the press Yes Sir I'm on my way back. Did the test driver return yet? Are you still studying to become a pastor? Yeah But I haven't gotten that far because I've been busy It's funny that you're trying to help other people when you have troubles of your own when you couldn't even take care of your own family Don't you think so? You must pray a lot Do you pray for Min-ah and me from time to time? Often When you become a pastor, will you be able to save Min-ah's soul? Why did you come here? To pray for me?
