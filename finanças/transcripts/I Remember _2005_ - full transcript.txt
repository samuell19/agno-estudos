I REMEMBER One of my oldest memories is a photograph of a ship. Aunt Nieta was returning from America. I thought it was on that ship. The adults said that babies were brought by a stork. I don't know why, I thought they came on a ship... in the middle of the mist, from some unknown place. Would it be America? USE IT, DON'T ABUSE IT There is a bull on the line Yes, there is There is a bull on the line Catarina goes by train This comes as a goodbye As a goodbye this comes My mother became toothless - Stop, boy! Keep quiet! - Bitch! - What did you say, you brat? - Bitch! You're gonna see, you little punk! Guilherme! Come and see what your son is saying here! What is it, woman? - What is it? - Tell your father what you said! - Bitch! - What did you say? - Bitch! - Where did you learn this, brat? Where did you hear this, you brat? That's enough, man! He's not going to do this anymore! Now repeat! Swallow your tears! That's enough, man! He's not gonna do this anymore! Are you, my little son? I told you to swallow your tears! I thought I was the centre of the world. All that existed was a God's wonderful invention just to test me. Life was a theatre and it only made sense because I was there. That is, if I closed my eyes and plugged my ears... immediately the whole world would stop existing. They said I would return American With tons of money That I would be very rich That I couldn't stand the sound of the tambourine anymore And would get goose pimples hearing the "cu?ca". They said that with the hands I was worried Aunt Nieta liked to sing in the bathroom... and I loved to hear her voice. What I didn't understand... was Zeca and Nenzinho's excitement going up that ladder. Be careful! Guiga is looking at us! But he can't see. He knows nothing! Que ser? ser? Whatever will be, will be The future is not ours to see Que ser? ser? What will be, will be When I was just a little girl I asked my mother What will I be? Will I be rich? Will I be pretty? That's what she said to me Que ser? ser? Whatever will be, will be The future is not ours to see Que ser? ser? What will be, will be She is not coming and not even the pigeon has returned After that woman left me I don't know why Get out of here, my boy, before I step on you! Guiga wants to smell. - What, my son? - Guiga wants to smell. The parrot went dumb and the water pipe is leaking Look at this, Cr?u! This boy wants to smell me! Get out of here, you little punk! Ugly! Once on holidays we went to spend a few days at uncle Arnaldo's farm. They were days full of insignificant and great experiences. Look who's going there! Gisaldina! Gisaldina! Suc-ker! Suc-ker! Suc-ker! Suc-ker! You gang of little monsters! Do you think I don't know? One of these days, one of these chicks... is going to be born with one of your faces! Put there: Zeca's ding-dong has grown. Or his little friend... or willy. You could say, "his lower parts have been affected". - Zeca's pisser is altered. - None of this will do! There are things that cannot be said to Mr. Guilherme. Dick... dickie... dicko. - I still think birdie is better. - Let's see how this is: "Mr. Guilherme, come urgently. Zeca's urethra is swollen." People! That boy hasn't gone to sleep yet? My goodness! Guiga is already like this? How he has grown, my dear! He's becoming a little man! - Intelligent! You have to see! - Sit down, Mrs. Aurora. Well, Guiga, let's take a photo? Come up here, I'm going to take a beautiful photo. But with this hair... he looks like a girl, Mrs. Aurora! Was it a promise? He's going to have his hair cut next week. This photo is for me to remember how he looked like with long hair. Once I woke up in the middle of the night. Uncle Pedro was having an attack... and screamed as if he were possessed. I remember that I felt real horror at the simple fact that I was alive. I thought: I'm in this! It's not a game! It's real! I'm alive! Nandinha was a sleepwalker. One night, when no one noticed... she left the house and ended up in "Baixa do Bigode". On returning she was seen by the neighbour, who guided her in... carefully, because he thought that if the girl woke up... she could die of fright. The little boat Floats quickly Floats endlessly Now, Guiga, you're going to play the piano. Give me your little hand. Your thumb on C. Nandinha was a boarder in Merc?s College against her wish. But when the sisters discovered that she was a sleepwalker... they called my father and sent her back home. That's how my sister escaped from boarding school... and now she was going to get married to Mrs. Elvira's son. And now you will be my husband And sing the glory of my heart This guy Lol? who is going to marry Nandinha is really ugly! Poor girl! The man looks like a mummy! And worse still he is coloured! But he is a graduate, my dear. A ring on his finger! I think she did well! That hollow saint! Nowadays what is important in a man is that he has... character and personality... you understand? As well as a big dick! - You're terrible, Ded?! - Well! Better ugly than nothing! - It would be worse to be a spinster! - I don't agree! An honest woman could very well be single... and not necessarily be unhappy! A woman could very well enjoy certain pleasures... and not stop being a sweet little virgin. What do you mean? Don't we only have a hymen in the front, my dear? - You're crazy? - Don't men like hymens? Well, I'm keeping mine very carefully! I know a girl... someone told her that alum was good for it. And so, she got one, put it in a glass of water, see... to later rub it on her pussy... so her fianc? would think she was still a virgin! She went to the bathroom, and while looking for the water... her fianc? knew nothing, and she asked: "My dear... where is my glass of water that I left here?" The fianc? answered through a tightly closed mouth, like this: "I drank everything!" Envy, my mother! Pure envy! You know that it's all lies. - I adore him! - Pissing Ray! Are you not ashamed? You're going to get married and still piss on the bed! Stop shaming your sister! Don't worry, my daughter! You know how disturbed this boy is! But he's right, my daughter... this urinating on the bed is not right! If your fianc? finds out about this... he's going to give you back to your father! And now we'll be together United forever in the name of God I only know that Nandinha married Lol?... and never again pissed on the bed. Daddy? What is it, girl? Let me go there below. No, madam! Stay there! Let's sleep! Daddy? Daddy? - What is it, girl? - Let me go! What's the problem? - What did you lose down there? - I want to see Ded?. - What's with Ded?? - I want to see her fooling around. Her what? Where did you learn this, you terrible little girl? Aurora! - Aurora! - What? Come here! Aurora! You have to see what this terrible little girl has learnt! I go out to work... you have to know what happens in here! Go straight to bed! She wanted to see the neighbour's daughter fooling around. Those were her exact words: "fooling around". Now I ask, do you think this is right? Just look, Aurora! My goodness! It's hard! A little boy this young already like this! What do you think he's dreaming about? - This is full of piss! - Put this boy in the cradle. Where is my white handkerchief Washing-woman That I gave you to wash Washing-woman Where is my white handkerchief Washing-woman That I gave you to wash Washing-woman It's not my fault what happened Get out of here! Goodbye, my butterfly If you want to fly I say goodbye to my love I say, I say There is heaven! That's where God lives. There was a window in the middle of the stairs. Cicinha told me that God lived on the other side. God sees everything. He is everywhere. Sambalel? is sick Her head is broken Sambalel? needed A good beating Samba, Samba Sambolel? Step on the hem of her skirt Olal? Can't she find a better place for all that rubbing? It's the same thing every day! I threw a piece of wood at the cat But the cat didn't die I'm here! Who called? The Shaky Apartment Building won't charge you any taxes... because who pays everything is Mirta Perfumery. And the confusion in the Shaky Building begins. In apartment 302, the couple enjoy themselves. My dear, you are a comic character! - And you are my album! - So let's stick together then? Let's go. Stop! Stop, my dear, my father could see us! - One more, one more, one more... - No, no, look at father, my dear! - Daughter? - What is it, father? - Are you alone with your fianc?? - Yes, I am. - Is the light on? - It is. Then turn it off! Not even the dark can extinguish the radiant shine of your smile... when you use Eucalol Toothpaste. Carrying out the most perfect and complete mouth hygiene... Eucalol Toothpaste quickly removes the yellow from your teeth. Eucalol Toothpaste gives you a healthy smile. 100% financed by Mirta Perfumery... Built anywhere in the Marvellous City, the Shaky... Shaky... Shaky... Shake Building! He sees everything. He is everywhere. - Mum, I'm afraid. - Afraid of what, my son? Of Evilamem. Evilamem? But who is this Evilamem? Like in the prayer: "Deliver us from Evilamem." Oh, God! So innocent, my youngest one! Forget about this Evilamem, my sweet! Let's go to sleep! Blessing, godmother moon, give me bread with flour... The full moon brought Crazy Maria... who was going to get married to a famous English statesman. My mum liked this, she kept her going. He sent me a telegram from England! Who, Maria? Who is the guy who's gonna marry me? Isn't it Churchill? Really, Maria? Look what he sent me. He wants to take me to live with him. But the devil can go, not me! I've already told him that I'm not going there! You bet I'm not! And moreover: I'll only marry him if he quits that bloody cigar! Oh, Cr?u! Come and sing that song that he likes... ...to see if he sleeps! - Who called? Oh, Cr?u! Come here! Come and sing that song that he likes, to see if he sleeps. Oh Terram? Take my daughter, Terram? Take her, Terram? Sindolel?, ? sindolal? I stepped on the dry leaf I heard crush, crush Sindolel?, ? sindolal? I stepped on the dry leaf I heard crush, crush What face is that, boy? You look like a stray dog! It's nothing, Cr?u! That morning, going down the stairs, I saw the broken window. What was on the other side was no heaven. It was only Mrs. Elvira's yard. There she was hanging up clothes on the line. That was my first religious deception. Once, during Holy Week... we went to watch "The Life of Christ" in Jandaia. My first time in the movies. Seeing the suffering of the son of God... made me think He was only a poor devil! My notable Portuguese I want to offer you today With all my heart This my sincere cult My notable Portuguese I want to offer you today With all my heart This my sincere cult This my sincere cult If you were the Mother of God So pure and so Do you want one, uncle? Here! BRAZILIAN CHAMPION - 1959 Someone's not scratching right! And it's someone on the left side! I told you: cinema only if you scratch right! And what film are we going to watch, Nenzinho? An excellent one! Wonderful, really! With Kirk Douglas. But this side here is still flat! I want to be all goose pimples! And the spray that you promised? But this is in Carnival! Carnival is still a long way off. Whoever scratches right will get a big spray. What about me, Nenzinho? For you a small one. You are still small! I want a big one! - I hope your father sees this! - Now! What's wrong? I'll say nothing! Oh, Helena! Take this bag out of the middle of the house, girl! Child that I bless, you pass through my life... Child that I bless, you pass through my life... as, over the sea, the flight of a lonely and lost Alcyone. Child that I bless... you pass through my life... as, over the sea... the flight of a lonely and lost Alcyone. This here was at Christ the Redeemer! This is me, can you see? Cicinha, come here, Nenzinho in the Christ "Redemand!" It's not "Redemand", you idiot! It's Redeemer! Look what I got! I think it's better you go now. I don't want anyone to know. I trust you, you hear? I don't even want to know what you have there! Your blessing, my godmother. That shitface Zecawill pay me! I was a child and I hoped Some day to be happy I promised I gave lots of sweets To the little saints We never knew why, but whenever there was a party in the house... uncle Pedro would collect all the empty bottles he could find. Her lover ask her Cosmas and Damian Crispin, Crispinian Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to Guiga Happy birthday to you And the promise I made I have paid Parties and more parties I have had And on this happy day I remember Once Mrs. Elvira was crazy for a while. They said it was because of her menopause. If I only knew what the hell menopause was! In the placid banks of Ipiranga The resounding cry Of a heroic people And the Sun of Freedom Shine in the sky of the Country The equality We win With a strong arm In your breast O Freedom Challenge our breast With our own death O loved country! There was the fire of hell. In the catechism of the first communion... they said we must eat the flesh of God to be saved. I thought that was an enormous hope... but when I swallowed the host nothing happened! Anyway, what kind of god was that who never appeared clearly? Now you are beginning to feel your eyes heavy... heavy... it seems as if your lids are made of lead... heavy... heavy... Don't resist... give in to this sweet sleep... deep... heavy... Let your body lean forward... and backward... to one side... and to the other... This... deep... forwards... backwards... to one side... to the other... Anita? Deep... Anita, you're a babe! Heavy... Some of you already find yourselves under my power. Mrs. ?ris! Come here! When I count to three... you will wake up from this state of hypnoses... and you will remember nothing. One... two... three! You mean the woman had an attack, and almost died of fright? I'm sure this was Zeca's fault, Aurora! I don't know what to do with that boy anymore. He's bad natured. I think the only thing is boarding him at a priest's school... or a military school, to see if he improves. Take my word: he's never going to be anything in life! But it was also the education you gave him! They're all going to lose because of you! You're a very wrong woman, Aurora! Are you already asleep, woman? We didn't know it... but on that night uncle Pedro was going away forever... taking his bottle treasure with him. Boys of Bahia Now at this children's time The message of hope Is brought with happiness That on the earth, earth in flower There will be, there will be love That in the sky, in the sky of blue There will be more splendour And while we sing There will be Brazil Brazil To begin the program today... on the piano we will have a solo of "Hungarian Rhapsody 2..." played by a boy who's only 11 years old... but who plays like an adult. The boy Guilherme de Almeida Filho, Guiga! How beautiful the days Of the beginning of existence Breathing the innocent soul As perfuming the flower The sea is a serene lake The sky a blue cloak The world a golden dream And life a hymn of love Summertime was walking barefoot, sling, kites. It was fishing, swimming in the river, running free. It was sucking mangoes and eating fruits. It was tropical fruits of all types... it was roasting nuts... Summertime was insect bites, melons, laziness. "It's not easy to deal with pirlimpimpim powder. You have to sniff the right amount. Not too much, not too little... or else you'll go here or there but not where you want to go. Close your eyes tightly, like we do when sleeping... when we're going to fall from a cliff. Stay a minute like this." The television has arrived! The television has arrived! The television! The arrival of the television was fantastic... now I could see the programs that I only knew by name: Roy Rogers, Jim of the Jungle, Circus Boy... The Toddy Troopers, Rin Tin Tin... Zorro, The Highway Ranger. My God: make me grow up soon. Don't worry, it's silly... but I want to grow up to see adult films... to smoke and be able to go wherever I want... to do everything that is prohibited. My father said that Carnival was the party of the devil... and every year he took the family to the countryside. But that year Zeca had got a girlfriend... and decided to jump off the train. My God, what a disgrace! This is a disgrace! And how are you going to live? Can you keep a family? You fool! You've never been worth anything anyway! You could tell that girl that you're mixed up with... to kill this sorrowful baby while there's time! Why don't you kill yourself! If I were you, I'd drink strychnine... formicide, any poison! I'd put a bullet in my head! Or I'd throw myself from Lacerda Elevator! Zeca! Don't worry, my son! In time you'll get a job, earn your money. For the moment I'll give you some groceries... from the house, every week. You can come to pick them up. Don't worry, my son. He's nervous. He's like that. But it's not from the heart! He gets like that, but It's only for your good. We have the pleasure to announce... another program from Radio Theatre of the Americas. The play today is a dramatisation... of an original by Edgar Alan Poe... and it's called "There Was a Heart Beating". What a life, my God! I can't stand this life anymore, Aurora! The woman has to help her husband! But not you! You do the opposite of what I ask! This is why this unfortunate thing happened! You only follow your head! I can't stand it anymore! I don't want this life anymore! If your father were alive, I'd return you! But I'm going to speak with Arnaldo. He's your brother... you could very well go live with him. Here in this house, I don't want you anymore! Son of a bitch! What a son of a bitch! I hate you, you old shit bag! I want you to die! I know it's a sin, my God, but I hate my father! I want him to die! "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lie in green pastures... and leads me by calm waters. He restores my soul... and guides me through the path of justice in the love of His name..." I felt as if I was in a film. It was as if what was happening had nothing to do with me. "...and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever." There is a bull on the line Yes, there is There is a bull on the line Catarina goes by train This comes as a goodbye As a goodbye this comes My mother became toothless From biting my father so much "My mother became toothless from biting my father so much". I don't know why that old song came back to me then, at that moment... Leaving me divided, with as much pity for one as for the other. Aurora... Aurora... you couldn't have done this to me! You left me alone! "Our Father who art in Heaven... - Aurora! - ...Hallowed by Thy name... ...Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done... I'm sorry! ...Give us today our daily bread and forgive our trespasses... as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. - Amen." - I'm afraid to fall Take me Take me I'm homesick Girl, you don't remember That beautiful afternoon You forget, I remember I remember I remember Oh mother, mother Oh my mother She left me crying Where is my mother, where? She left me crying Where is my mother, where? The house became a desert. She was the happiness of our lives. During the holidays at Holy Week... I was back at the scene of summertime. But nothing could be as it had been once. It was as if something had parted forever inside of me. On the other hand, I was less watched... freer to discover a world of new things which were shown to me. Now it's my turn! - No way! Are you an idiot? - You promised! No way! Who told you to be so stupid? But I only let you because you said you would let me! I don't wanna know. You let me because you wanted to. You bastard! You deceived me! Guiga! Guiga? Guiga! Let's get out of here! We're only taking the little thing for a walk! She's our teacher! Are you not a man, boy? Let's go, Dajega! Forget it, Dajega! Guiga is soft! This Guiga seems as if he were raised by his grandmother! My government will be one of laws... of traditions and moral and political principles... that reflect the Brazilian spirit. On that April fool's day... there was news that could have been a lie but it wasn't: SCHOOL the military had taken over... and were in power. Mas-tur-ba-tion. This is one of those sins against chastity... for which God... prepared Hell for! With the discovery of this forbidden pleasure... comes the desire to practice the act... at all moments... to feel again... that stupid pleasure. After that, the boy just can't stop! He can't stop masturbating anymore! This without mentioning the sins... that, for their iniquity... I refuse to talk about in a classroom! The indecent acts performed in the rear! Don't think that condemnation only comes after death! No! In many cases the punishment begins here... as a consequence of your sins! Look here. "Masturbation provokes venereal joy... ...through contact with the hand." - What does "venereal" mean? "Venal... vendor... veneer..." Here! "Venereal: related to Venus, Goddess of Beauty. Venereal diseases: syphilis... a purulent infection of the mucous membranes... ...mainly vagina and urethra." - Vagina is pussy! Who doesn't know? Look up "purulent". "Pursue... pursy... purulent: full of pus, that produces pus." Now look up "prostitute". "Prostitute: see Harlot." Damn! It seems they don't want us to learn! "Harlot: a woman who practices the sexual act for money... fallen lady, lady of the world, lady of the court... lady of the night, lost woman, prostitute... Whore, bitch, hooker, fucker, vagabond..." Zeca and Nenzinho had gotten married... and the house felt even emptier. The good thing is that now I had a room all to myself. Following the instructions of my older classmates... I manipulated myself with quick movements... wanting to discover the pleasure that I had never felt. Suddenly, I was overtaken by an uncontrollable wave... something unedited, wonderful... the craziest pleasure I had ever felt! Now I knew what the word "cum" meant. And I began to understand why the world revolved around sex. After that day, bath time became sacred: Sophia Loren, Gina Lollobrigida... Claudia Cardinale, Suzanne Pleshette, Brigitte Bardot. They all came to die in my trained, implacable hand. This woman can't carry any weight! People are gonna say I killed her! Guiga! Help her, my son, help her with this box! They're your books! The moving to that apartment didn't work out. My father had sold the old house... but the deal wasn't closed and we had to move everything back. I'm gonna tell my father you're reading Jorge Amado. Tell him! It was him who bought it for me! He bought it because he doesn't know the pornography this man writes! You shitty little saint! I didn't know you were smoking! You still haven't seen anything, brother! And did you like the film? - It's your first adult film, isn't it? - Yes. And money? Do you have any money? I do. I got some from the old man. How much do you have? - About two hundred. - That will do. I'm going to take you to meet the girls! That was a night of initiation. After the movie, Zeca took me to Maria da Vov?. It was my first time in bed with a woman. I don't know why Cicinha entered a convent... but my sister always had a certain religious tendency. She had invented a backyard god for me, after all. Anita! Anita, my daughter, help me here! What do you want, father? Don't speak like that! I'm asking because you know I can't see! I have tried every way. I just can't open this up! I forgot the secret. Has someone tried to open this? Father, who would do this? I'm only asking! Has someone tried to open it? No. Because I always leave it in away to make it easy... and now it's not! Be patient. See if you can open this. I can't see anything! You need the secret, father. See if you can remember where you put the secret. Anita! Have a look at this! Come see. You're not gonna believe it, but I'm telling you... at night I prayed, I asked. When I arrived here this morning, it was like this. Look! Do you see this? It was her! I remember the only time Anita and I visited Cicinha in the convent. Her eyes were oblique, a little changed by emotion. Under Mother Superior gaze, it seemed she wanted to show... greater happiness than she was really feeling. But Cicinha didn't stay very long in the convent. She was expelled because the sisters found out... there was a mad uncle in the family. They couldn't accept this. You need to have this hair cut, boy! You look like a punk, with this long hair! I can't, father. I'm going to study. All this week I have tests. Tomorrow I have a Physics test! I don't want to know! You have to have this hair cut! Can't you hear me, boy? You're going to have this hair cut now! I'm gonna have it cut when I want! Do you see this, Anita? This boy is disrespecting me! Do you see, Anita? He's facing up to me! You can be sure: I'm not going to have this shit cut anymore! Do you know why? Because I'm a bitch! A bitch! This boy is sick! You need to go see a doctor. You're sick in your nerves. Remember your uncle had problems. You should have never had a family! Never! You killed my mother! You nazi executioner! As never before in my life, I wanted a sensitive father. And once more I sought refuge in the movies. I had discovered the art sessions at the Guarany. No way! I will speak up! I say whatever I want, you hear me? No way! No way! I say whatever I want! So don't you bother me, okay? Don't you bother me! Don't you bother me! Look: I'm gonna tell you something... because in the past those gentlemen... heads of families, they came here, you know? They said at home... that they'd go to an amateur radio club... that they were going to listen to the BBC from London. Do you know what BBC they came to listen to here? It was mouth, pussy and ass! It was mouth, pussy and ass! Those little French niggers from the brothel! What do you want? What are you looking at? For crying out loud! What are you looking at? Don't you know me, you little chicken? ALLIANCE FOR THE PROGRESS IS A FARCE! Guiga, is it you? - It's me. - I was waiting for you. I couldn't sleep after what you said to me. I don't want to fight with you, my son. But you said something that you can't say to a father. Listen to what I'm going to tell you: when my misfortunes are old, yours will be young. Don't think it's a curse I'm throwing at you! I want you to be very happy. My son... I don't want to fight with you anymore! Let's make a non-aggression pact. Shake my hand. We are not going to fight anymore. Come on! Come on! This is not a fuckhole! One beautiful day, my father thought Cr?u was too old... to continue working... and got her a place in an asylum. She knew that that was her last stop. Oh Terram? Take my daughter, Terram? Take her, Terram? Take my daughter, Terram? Oh my mother Terram? doesn't want To take me, mother Take her, Terram? Cr?u died during Carnival. Her coffin was alone all night, no one there to watch the body. Look, have you ever seen a black actress... who didn't play the role of a slave or a maid? You don't you see, man, you don't! Centuries of slavery and subservience! That's why black people grew this fucking inferiority complex! But this has to stop! You know M?rio Gusm?o, don't you? He's the one who's filming "Black Angel", isn't he? He was arrested for having grass. They humiliated the guy. Do you think that if he were white the treatment would be the same? I don't know, Bira. I think the worst problem is to be broke, man! Because a black guy who has money is well treated. Look at Pel?! Come on, Daniel? Shit! That's not the same! He's "a black man with a white soul", as some people say! Get?lio had disappeared. Now he was involved in a clandestine organisation. He had even asked if we would get into the armed fighting. But none of us had enough conviction or courage. That's Get?lio there! Helinho, man! Are you armed, Get?lio? It's routine in the organisation, for an emergency. We never know. But I don't intend to use it. At least not at the moment. Don't worry. - The guys are there. Come see them. - Sure. Hello, man! It's so good to see you! Long time no see! Guiga! What's up, Get?lio? The situation is getting worse! The population only knows what the military want them to know. They manipulate the information! They say we're bank robbers... but the money from the robberies is to finance the war! We kidnap people to liberate companions... who are being tortured cruelly in prison! Even here in the Federal Police there are some people. The guys are sadists, professional torturers! They do terrible things! Drowning, hanging from wood, shocks in the balls! They stick an electric wire in the guy's urethra! It's an incredible pain! When they want to kill someone... they said our guy committed suicide! Or say it was an escape and the body disappears. That was the last time that we saw Get?lio. After that night no one had anymore news about him. FREEDOM FOR EMILIANO! Clodoaldo, Brazil attacking, Tost?o... Let's go, people! What a ball, Clod?, look, look, look! At the score! BRAZIL, LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT Clodoaldo! AUTHORITARIANISM CORRUPTION, MISERY Look... my dear Brazil, at the score, Clodoaldo! Released after the autopsy... The body has 4 holes caused by bullets... ...the left hand was on the half-cut limb. The top jaw bone was toothless. ...the body had bruises on the right side. The body of Lamarca couldn't be photographed... TERROR DIES WITH LAMARCA by determination... of Governor Ant?nio Carlos Magalh?es. My heart is green, yellow White and blue I love you, my Brazil I love you No one can hold down Brazilian Youth The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. The punishment begins here. Now repeat! And even if I walk in the valley of darkness... Here! Why don't you kill yourself? I don't know anything! And while the country celebrated the Brazilian miracle... I knew my season in hell. The guerrillas were chased and tortured to death. I spent the nights awake, panicking. I couldn't sleep. Neurosis finally had overcome me. I began to take a lot of anti-depressants... in the purest pain and unhappiness... with my morbid fixation for suicide. I identified myself with Torquato, a twisted angel... his fate was to face he choir of the satisfied. Listen, Daniel, I need to tell you something: for the Love of God don't let me return from the anaesthesia. I want euthanasia. Euthanasia. I have written it down. It's here, signed. Euthanasia... My stay in that hospital was short... but a routine exam showed an irreparable loss. If it is true that the gods feed on human suffering... in my case their appetite was voracious. Take me to the church. I want to receive Holy Communion! I'm afraid of Evilamem. What do you want from me, you son of a bitch??! What do you want with me??! Do you know what this means? I know! Don't torture yourself! I don't care! I love you, Guiga! I don't care! I love you! Let's play that! Let's play that. Let's have a good time. Let's play! Let's have a good time... Let's play! Happiness is the final proof of Man! TV Aratu channel 4 Salvador, my love, Bahia Maybe in the packet you'll find what you need. Stop, listen, walk, look. It won't cost you anything. It'll only cost you your life. The old piano was already sold for a cheap price... to a Protestant minister... and a little later the house itself would be sold. Like a house cat, I stayed for a little longer... and for the first time I found myself living alone. In a radical subversion of the order... the house was open to the nuts. We had no time or place for anything. That was my first true communion... with the right to Pentecost and everything. It was my first communion with grass. And tongues as if of fire became visible... and on each of them rested one. In the beginning it's really like this. And they were all full of the Holy Spirit... and began to speak in different tongues. There is no way of escaping your own destiny. Oedipus tried, but ended up facing what he wanted to avoid. He deciphered the enigma of the Sphinx and was spared... but this didn't help him. Knowing himself was the cause of his fall. No man can say he was happy... before he arrives at the last day of his life. It was you who brought these people here. Who are they? Relax, Guiga. They're nice people. It's a French couple, friends of mine, Alain and Juliette. The other is Pablito. No man can say he was happy... before he arrives at the last day of his life. That Pablito intrigued me from the first moment. He had a strange fascination over people. Shit! This Guiga is too crazy! What's up, Guiga? Far out! I'm starving! Shit! The guy really sticks out! Everything is numbers. Love is the knowledge of the number and nothing is infinite. Or better: does he fit here, in the space-kiss of hunger? Pablito was versed in magic, astrology and the Cabala. Initiated in the tarot and perversions... in fatality and in the acceptance of destiny. - I can't hold on to it! - Come on, Guiga! But you always say it's beautiful living in a community, man! You have to know that no one belongs to anyone. Put this in your head, my friend! Don't fret. The girl only wants to dance. Let's go there. Come here, boy! Let's dance. Although I was easy prey for the bad trips, I smoked every day... and I was curious about new experiences. For me it was a challenge: to become a real man, I had to learn to face my demons. This is good stuff! Do you remember Edu? Yes. He went to try his luck in London, with the flute. "Love it and leave it." Yeah. Things are not easy, my friend. There's a lot of people giving up. Most already finish school for the industrial area... thinking about marriage. They're gonna end up as fat as cows. And Get?lio, man? He just disappeared. I want to learn the guitar... but this is for later. To get some money, I'm gonna give some yoga classes... or sell veggie sandwiches on the beach. I'm going to Chapada. There's a community there. The spider lives by what it weaves. I want to plant to eat. And you, Guiga? I don't know. I'm thinking about buying a Super-8. You really get off on this artist trip, don't you? It's good... when it works out. But don't think art will release you. Sooner or later you are gonna meet the Sphinx, friend. The sun! Billions, trillions of megatons... nuclear explosions... eternally. "But the fool on the hill... sees the sun going down... and the eyes in his head... see the world spinning around." What is it? What are you looking at? Don't you know me, you chicken? Gisaldina! Gisaldina! Suc-ker! Suc-ker! Sindolel?, ? sindolal? I stepped on the dry leaf I heard crush, crush. "It's not easy to deal with pirlimpimpim powder. You have to sniff the right amount. No more nor less." You are old, father, your hair is very white... and you still caper around. - Do you think this is right?" - Look. The guy's stoned. How are things, my friend? In my youth I didn't do it... because I feared it might damage my brain. But now that I'm perfectly sure I does not.... why, I do it again and again. Suddenly I was filled with a wave of deep compassion. A wave that spread through my chest... and seemed to embrace the whole world. Where's the beast, Mr. Guiga? In the 21st Century everything will be different. The Third Millennium... the Age of Aquarius. - Or mere illusion. - That's it! All light! One day everything that exists will become light. The sky was beautiful Full of stars Illuminating the butterfly To see her beauty Did you see that? You have to make a wish. To whom, Daniel? Who do I have to ask? Guiga! Guiga! Guiga! Let's go, Guiga! Guiga is soft, boy! It seems he were raised by his granny! Do you know what the female mule said to the male mule? This is the ass, mule! There is heaven. That's where God lives. I have to take this boy to the doctor! I'm afraid! Crazy, crazy... Look! The guy has gone nuts. "Stay a minute like this, with your eyes closed... Like we do when we're sleeping, when we're falling over a cliff. When you open your eyes, everything will be right again." That's enough, man! He's not gonna do this anymore! That's enough, man! Child that I bless... you pass through my life... as, over the sea... the flight of a lonely and lost Alcyone. DEDICATED TO MY FATHER, MY MOTHER, TONINHO AND CR?U, WHO ARE ALREADY IN HEAVEN.
