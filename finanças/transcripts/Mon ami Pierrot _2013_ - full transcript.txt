- Shit... - What is it? Shit. What's going on? What? It's Pierrot. MY FRIEND PIERROT TO MY DEAR MOTHER Pierrot - are you alright? - Yes. Look at that. Three city workers, yet no one can keep up. They should do their job. Hi, Serge! Let's stop to say hello. I have homework for tomorrow. We'll be quick. Are you coming? It's good to see you. You too. Hi. Check this out. To the boar's health! I let the dogs run around over there. - How's my nephew? - Good. Aren't you coming? You know, you could come up here more often. - We could go hunting. - I don't know how. You'll go with me. I'll teach you. Your father was a hell of a hunter. Too bad he didn't take it up again. She was so proud of you. "My son." She'd always say, "my son", never Pierrot. - Do you remember that? - No. That damn illness. Ready to go? Are you fucking kidding? - What's going on? - The wolf. Two attacks this week. Again? He hides up in the mountains. I see. Goodbye. - It was nice to see you. - I'll come by this week. - Hi. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. I'm sorry to bother you so late on a Sunday. I tried to start my car, but nothing happened. Would you mind taking a look? No, of course not. I wouldn't normally bother you like this. I have a big meeting tomorrow and I can't be late. Pierrot. Can you watch Ms. Torres's mother? That's nice of you. Pierrot's here. - Are you sure you don't mind? - No, no. That's very nice of you. She really likes you. Pierrot. - Did you have a good weekend? - Yes. - My cousin's at my house. - The champion? He knows a deadly counter-attack. Checkmate in 6 moves. - You have to show me. - How much will you give me? I'm joking, Pierrot. See you at break? Bye. Excuse me. You're exaggerating. It's just a dog. Nothing more. It isn't a baby. When I'm with him, it's inevitable. Never get a pet. You'll only be sad when it dies. It wasn't my choice. I didn't. My parents were the ones who had a dog. You're projecting. Nothing's a choice. Let's have a barbecue. We'll have a meeting. We'll talk salary. Nucho, are you planting bad seeds when my back's turned? You have to get to them early. Otherwise, it's too late. They go deaf. - Will I see you Sunday? - Sure. Bring your wife and kids. - Shit, it stinks in here. - That's not the toilet. It's Pierrot. Isn't that right, Pierrot? His dad works in the dump. Didn't you notice flies gather around him? Shit, you're right. They're giant. That one's huge. - Leave so we can breath. - Yeah, get out of here. Are you stupid, or what? We said get out. Hurry up. Move. No, but seriously. You're taking your time. - What do you want? - Ten. The cash. Get out of here. "In the end Buck's pertinacity was rewarded, for the wolf, "finding that no harm was intended, finally sniffed noses with him. "Then they became friendly, and played about "in the nervous, half-coy way with which fierce beasts "belie their fierceness. "After some time of this, the wolf started off at an easy lope "in a manner that plainly showed he was going somewhere. "He made it clear to Buck that he was to come, "and they ran side by side through the sombre twilight, "straight up the creek bed, into the gorge from which it issued. "On the opposite slope of the watershed "they came down into a level country "where there were great stretches of forest and many streams. "Buck was wildly glad. "He knew he was at last answering the call. "Old memories were coming upon him fast. "He was doing it again, running free in the open, "the unpacked earth underfoot, the wide sky overhead." Any reaction? Doesn't it affect you at all? It's nice. Yes, it's nice, but besides that? What's the difference between a dog and a wolf? - Yes? - A wolf is stronger. A wolf is a wild animal. Yes, what does "wild" mean? Bad? Not necessarily. A dog can be trained by Man to be bad. Abdou, do you want to speak? No, I was thinking of my neighbor's pit bull. Don't laugh. What's the difference between a pit bull and a wolf? Pit bulls are ugly. Pitbulls are specifically trained to be aggressive. Wolves only attack to feed or to defend themselves. So, "wild"... Doesn't anyone know? In the beginning, "wild" meant living in the forest, in contrast to men, who lived in the clearings to escape from wild animals. Yes? What about mushrooms... are they wild animals? "Wild" means living far from humans, not being tamed by Man. Going back to Jack London's text, there are other words which mean the same thing. Think about Buck, who is forced to pull a sled or be whipped. - Free? - Yes, Pierrot? - Free. - Yes, free. That's Jack London's intention. Buck finds freedom. Sure, that's funny. Will someone go with Vincent? Pierrot. You idiot... - Excuse me? I'm the idiot? - Yes. Are you kidding? Go cry to your mom. - Enough, Vincent. - Go eat shit. No swearing in my class. Vincent, go. Let's get back to the text. Do you like the book? - That book about the dog? - Yes. - What do you like about it? - I like adventure stories. - Aren't movies better? - It's not the same. I bet you didn't even get it. Why? Did you read it? - No need to. - What did you get? Come in. You're definitely not a wolf. If you're not a wolf, you're a dog. Just give me a second. You've got some nerve. Television for a pig. It can't get any worse. You laugh less than before, or is that my impression? No, I don't think so. When you were little, you laughed a lot. Do you remember... By the light of the moon, I farted in night In the water, it made bubbles It was a funny sight Then in came my grandmother, carrying a knife She chopped up my butt into four thousand bites So are you alright? You should talk. I'm sure he knows. What are you waiting for? I don't know. - The right time. - The right time... - What are you doing? - We were looking for you. Come on. Weed is our thing, asshole. If you don't want to get hurt, stop selling that shit, OK? OK, I get it. I was just having fun during break. Go jerk off in the bathroom. That will keep you busy. Sure, that's cool. Let's get out of here. Hi, Pierrot. Want to play Blitz chess? I'm almost done. Check... mate. Game over. Did you see that? That was a Legal Trap. You can be White. You didn't warm up. Ready? Let's go. Will you move the truck? Let's finish the job. Everyone's pissed off. Will you leave already? - Leave, get out of here. - Excuse me? I don't understand. You should speak more politely. Do you think I'm stupid? I'm talking to you. You want to play tough, is that it? Let's not get angry. You'll go. I'll forget the time I've lost. OK? - Do you know who I am? - I don't care. - I think workers deserve respect. - Respect? You're not working. You're being a pain in the ass. - Stop! - Don't touch me! I'll break both of your arms. No one will blame me. But I'd hate to see you get worker's compensation. I'll have you fired. Sir, I'll move the truck. Fuck! I didn't hear you. Alright. Will you fucking move? Some people work! That bastard! Pathetic! I'll ruin you, I'll ruin you. I'm going to fuck you up. I'll show you. I'll make you understand. I'll show you how to talk to a man! I'll teach you. - I'll kill you! I'll fuck you up! - Stop, Dad! I'll smash your face in, asshole. You'll be begging for mercy. On your knees! Serge, come on! - I'll blow your head off! - Stop that right now. This is insane. Put that away, or I'll call the cops. You want me to call them? I swear you'll never see me again. Did you think of Pierrot? Yes, exactly. I am. - I'm ashamed. - Calm down. I'm ashamed. Are you alright, son? Strange day yesterday. Yes. Listen... Don't worry. I lost it a bit, but it's fine. I'll deal with that guy. He'll regret playing ninjas with me. But without violence and without anger. We should also talk about Ms. Torres, Cecilia. You don't have to. It's a hard way to find out. - What do you think? - Nothing. You shouldn't be alone. Hello. I heard what happened. - Serge, are you alright? - I am. I'm well. I haven't felt this good in a while. We're with you. I'm going to fight because my cause is just. Serge isn't that a bit much? I think you're right. - We're treated like shit every day. - That's right, we are. - The same thing happened last week. - That's true. - Yeah. - Yeah. I'm going to see it through. - Set an example. - You have to start somewhere. Something should be said. - Hi Francis, how are you? - I'm fine. We're going to see Nucho. - You saw him, he's the union rep. - What for? To organize. We have to address what happened. It isn't my business, Serge. What do you mean? You were there, you saw everything. I saw that you lost it. You don't want me to say that, do you? I lost it? Shouldn't you have let it go? You didn't. I don't know why. It's not my business, so I won't go. Was I wrong about you? Are you chicken? I don't judge you. Don't call me a chicken, alright? - Serge, you've lost your mind. - I want to be respected. My work should be respected. Bus drivers strike when someone's assaulted. Why can't we? You weren't even assaulted! You just got into it with an asshole! - I can't believe it. You too? - What? What do you mean by that? Watch it, Serge. Shit is getting to you. You'll pay for it in the end. Such a combative rep. Excuse me? You want to lecture me on the union? You participate when convenient. Now you want us to strike. Are you kidding? Is the issue that I'm not in the union? No, stop. Seriously, stop. Serge. You're not new at this. There can't be a strike whenever you have a problem. We'd never get to work. Aren't the ninja's connections to city hall the issue? OK, get out. - Get out. - It's strange. If some kid had assaulted me, would you react the same way? You're out of control. Think of your kid. Don't be stupid. Don't talk about my kid, asshole! Is there a way to recognize the aggressor? I have his name and address. Christian Desmarais, from Lyon. - The head of Fogetra? - Yes. Were there witnesses? There were Passers-by, locals. There was a crowd. - He had you in an armlock. - Yes. Was it to get you under control? Checkmate? - Say it. - Checkmate. Checkmate. - You did that on purpose. - No. The checkmate. You saw it. Did you do that on purpose? Never be ashamed of your talent, especially with me. Do you hear me? Hi. Are you new here? Which grade are you in? Seventh. Why are you just starting now? It wasn't planned. I moved. What's your name? Chloe. I'm Florian. Have you been told you're pretty? Hey, Pierrot. Did you eat shit this morning? I can't take this anymore. I'm going to ask to move. - It stinks over here. - It does. Do you see those little white things? - Yeah. - Isn't that lice? He's seriously crawling with them. - You could have washed your hair. - Haven't you heard of shampoo? What is he wearing? Did you take your dad's clothes? Stay right there. Get your things. What happened? Pierrot, I need to know. I want to understand, but a fight in class is unacceptable. - Yes? - Can I get my... Yes, hurry up. Faster. Tell me, Pierrot. I know you're trying. I need to understand. It isn't like you to fight. There must be a reason. - Pierrot... - Let me go. I liked how you handled the teacher. Keven shouldn't have talked to you like that. And she shouldn't have treated you like a kid. What are you up to? I can't promise anything, but I'll try to intercede to see that you receive compensation. - You must withdraw your complaint. - What compensation? Perhaps monetary, but I'm saying too much. I just want a public apology. Mr. Fumaroli, that would be hard to get. What public apology, anyway? In front of a crowd on the Place des Terreaux, as they used to do for public executions? I understand how you feel. It's not about feelings, but principles. We're getting off track. You have to make an effort. It seems to have affected you, but disproportionately so. I should state that your insistence could be seen as stubbornness, even by your superiors. Do you understand me? Fuck. Come on. Mother, this is Pierrot. Pierrot, this is my mother. I don't know him. The door! Check this out. When you hold it, you feel like a man. Aren't you going to sit? Is that a porno? No. I don't like porno. Seen one, seen them all. - Take your phone calls elsewhere. - Shut the fuck up. Don't talk to me. Shut the fuck up. Are you kidding me? Deal with it yourself. I had someone drop out. You want to come with me and Thomas? What for? - We steal stuff and resell it. - Why? Why? - For the money. - I don't need any. You're weird. I ask, but at the same time... plenty of guys would want to work with me. I'm out of here. Are you coming? Bye. Where's the second helmet? - Why? - Get it. Take stuff that's worth something. Money, jewelry, and small high-tech stuff. - How did you know there's no alarm? - That's JB's job. He gives us the target, we break in, and he resells. Check that out, there's some stuff. It's easy, don't worry. Here. Welcome to the club. The cops are useless. That guy's going to know that you won't drop it. It could turn on you. I know some people. People. Yes, people. People who do favors, for favors. Thugs? Thugs... What do you mean? I don't know if it's the right word, but isn't that what you mean? - What? - Nothing. I'll pretend you never said a word. - Figure out what you want. - Francois, Please. In memory of your sister, never bring it up again. If you say so. Dad? I heard you come home. Are you alright? - Is your father home? - No. I think I know where he is. Listen, could you stay with my mother while I get him? She's asleep in her room. I'll be right back. Come on. You're pretty. Sure, come on. Cecilia... - You're a princess. - Stop it. We're fine. Hey, Pierrot. Can I have the key, please? Pierrot, look at me. I have to talk to you. - It's funny because... - Serge. I used to kneel down to be at your height. - This can't be! - And... - now you're too tall. - Enough! I want to talk to him. Pierrot, I promise we'll get through this. I swear, it will be fine. You're my buddy. My bed is... it's a flying carpet. Everything keeps moving all around. - I'm sorry. - It's nothing. Can you come here a moment, I'd like to talk. Won't you sit down? - Do you want something to drink? - No, thanks. Your father isn't well. Yes. Did he talk to you about us? About me and him? Yes. He shouldn't be alone. It's serious, you know. I don't want you to think I'm going to take anyone's place. How's school? Do you have friends? A girlfriend? Is that true? That's wonderful. Why does your mother stick out her tongue? It's new. It's weird, isn't it? It's... like a kind of reflex. Now, when she senses someone's there, she thinks it's to feed her. She searches with her tongue, like a giraffe. Pierrot, if you need to talk, I'm here for you. Do you understand? Chloe. Move forward, please. Are you alright? Yes, I'm fine. - Is that the house? - No. It's another one. Fucking Thomas! We won't wait for him all day. - I need to piss. - Go piss. That's all you guys ever do. Do you want my picture? Are you a pedophile? You want to go for a ride in your shitty car? You think you scare me in your drag-queen uniform? You piece of shit. If you ever touch me, I'll file a complaint. You'll be fired. Man. Let me go. You'll regret this. What did you say? I can't hear you. You like cake, right? I'm going to make you eat some. Eat it. Go on, eat it. Eat it. You like that? Here you go. Let's go. Excuse me. I'm looking for classroom A. Down the hall, last one on the right. Thanks. Come in. Hello, Mr. Fumaroli. Hello. Sorry, I have chalk on my hands. Please sit down. I've asked you here because of Pierrot's behavior. His grades are falling. I'm worried about his absences. I've talked to colleagues. They all said the same. Did you receive the letters that were sent? What letters? I see, I suppose that Pierrot got to them first. Are you alright, Mr. Fumaroli? Yes. There was an incident a few weeks ago. A fight between Pierrot and a classmate. I asked Pierrot about it. He wouldn't explain his behavior. Explanations are useless. Mr. Fumaroli, are you sure you're alright? Are there any problems at home? I don't understand. Pierrot's behavior has changed. Perhaps something has happened. His mother died when he was three. Yes, I see. That's terrible, but... I'm not sure it explains his sudden change in behavior. Maybe he sees the world is a shitty place. Are you keeping track of his homework? - It's my fault, right? - That isn't what I said. Listen to me. I'll raise my son however I want. You teach him useless stuff. I'm the one who's responsible for instilling values. Values that allow him to be a man in this shitty world, alright? - What are you doing next weekend? - Next weekend? I don't know. I think Thursday or Friday... What was his name? - He had a blue t-shirt and jeans. - Wait, I think... I don't know. I should ask my mother. Excuse me. Pierrot. Pierrot! What are you doing? I never see you anymore. You didn't sign up. I don't want to. Chess is for losers. What? What is this? You used to love it. Now it's for losers? I don't want to, that's it. - You don't play at all anymore? - No. - There has to be a reason. - I don't want to. That's stupid, Pierrot. Sometimes you aren't in the mood, but it comes back. I'm signing you up. Whether or not you go, I'm signing you up. Fuck. - Vincent, a guy's coming over. - Hide. How is he? Is he big? No, not really. Vincent? - Careful, kids. - Shut up. Vincent? - Vincent? Is it alright? - Everything's OK. Don't look at me. Pierrot, come see. Look. Have you seen this? - Yes. - It's funny, isn't it? - Have you seen this one, too? - Yes. I'm sure there's one you haven't seen. I have homework, Dad. She cracked me up, seriously. Where's Chloe? Who are you? Did you swallow your tongue? - It's like the time you fell. - Stop, drop it. We should have filmed it. Bye, Pierrot. See you tomorrow. - The quality's nice. - Seriously. Wait, check this out. Did she know you were filming? - What do you think? - Shit, Chloe's pretty. - Seriously. - She's so hot. - What a little whore. - She's a real slut. What's going on? - Watch out, he's coming! - Go! Pierrot? Are you alright? What happened? Your nose is bleeding. Come on. No. Are you sure? Pierrot! What happened? Come on, let's clean you up. Take a tissue. Cover your nose to stop the bleeding. If you need help, I'm here. OK? She didn't leave you? She died ten years ago! She never left me. It was my fault. I pushed her away. Stop that. I can't believe it! You're an idiot, you're lying! It's true, I'm doing fine. I'm fine, I swear. You're fine? Have you seen yourself? It looks like you haven't been out in ten years. Won't you trust me, Serge? You close yourself off and you expect me to do nothing. And to say nothing. I'm strong, you know. My neighbor mentioned it. She went to the station for nothing. - If I did my homework... - I think those guys - are psychopaths. - More than psychopaths. - ...and the conditional. - It's really disgusting. Audrey, Josephine may I hear what's so interesting? I'm waiting. It's because some old lady was killed. Some old lady? In the next town over, some lady was killed for 80 euros. It's scary. She was disabled. It can be discussed later. The people who did it should be killed. Cut them into pieces. - Do you want to talk about it? - Yes. Alright, but this isn't a reason to say whatever, is that clear? Raise your hands. Yes? They should go to prison until they understand. - Who agrees? - No, they should be hung. If they're dead, it won't happen again. Vincent, do you have something to say? Bring back the death penalty. It will be fine. I've always been able to get through it. There are no words... I have to get out. I can't stay here and be worn down by sedatives. You need to rest. - The papers... - Yes. Do you have the papers? - I can't. - Leave it. I'll take care of it. And Pierrot? Pierrot isn't doing well. He isn't eating. I'm not hungry, either. I force myself so that he eats. Most of all, he doesn't talk. Be careful with him. - Pierrot isn't strong. - I know. Hello, Mr. Fumaroli. Are you here for Ms. Torres? Yes. - Is it necessary? She isn't well. - It won't take long. We'd also like to talk to you and your son to check a few things. - 9 a.m. tomorrow in the office. - My son? Is that necessary? Hasn't he been through enough? It's necessary, Mr. Fumaroli. Tell me it isn't true. Please. Tell me I'm wrong. SUBTITLES: RED BEE MEDIA FRANCE
