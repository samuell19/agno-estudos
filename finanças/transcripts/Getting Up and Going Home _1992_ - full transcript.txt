It's April. Spring. And I'm in love with two women. I'm also about to turn 50. Hmm. Time to get up, Jack. When's he coming home? Tomorrow night. I love you, Kimberly Stevens. And I love you, Jack Montgomery. Jack. Your tie. You must be working late. Hi, it's Lily. Can you bring up my blue suede boots tomorrow night? They're on the shelf of the closet in the back. Much appreciated, kind sir. Sorry I missed you. Debbie, what are you doing sitting in that chair? Yeah, don't you wipe that tear with me. How you doing, old girl? How's that eye, huh? Yeah, the medicine is working. You wanna get down? Don't jump, don't jump. Easy, easy. It's tough getting old, huh? Now you know how I feel. Jesus loves you. Repent. Repent, sinner. Judgment Day's ahead. Repent. Repent, sinner. Judgment Day's ahead. No, Mr. Montgomery has no open time. Look, I can refer you to one of his associates. Late night, huh? Would you hold, please? -Morning. -Good morning. Call my wife for me, please. Tell her I'll pick her up for dinner about 7:00. Mmm-hmm. George Otis called. And Kimberly Stevens. Thank you. And this just came for you. No, nothing throws Kim. She'll be glad to meet you. Hi. I'm back here. It's very impressive. Yeah, we bought it for a song. Ah... Surprise, surprise. We have a guest. Jack Montgomery, this is Kim. Jack. -Hello. -Hello, Kim. And this is, uh, um... Uh, Colin, yes? Stevens? -I knew it, yeah. -Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too, Colin. Dad, I got the bookends I made for you. I decided purple. Purple? I like purple. You want to show me? Yeah. I have to call Australia. Will you give me a minute? Come here. Then I'll give you a tour of the place. Should have seen it before we fixed it up. It was like a whore house. Really, it was. A sink in every room. The proud and raunchy architect. Would you like wine or something? Oh, wine is fine for me. Thank you. Would you like me to open that? Please. These little buggers intimidate the hell out of me. I end up drinking the cork. Yeah. Well, you have to get this thing right in the middle of the cork, otherwise you're in trouble. You live in the city? Uh, yes, yes. Well, I have a house in the country. Keep in an apartment here during the week for late appointments, that sort of thing. Uh, business appointments. You know, being a lawyer and all that. So yes, I live here during the week, and in the country on the weekend, with my family. Ow. -Mmm. -God, are you all right? You really whacked yourself. You okay? Gave myself a fat lip there. -Here. -Thank you. Appreciate the dinner on a dime. Scott tells me that you're a fantastic wife, producer... Scott's blind. He loves me. Cheers. Your dreams. That's a beautiful toast. You should have been a writer. Oh, I wanted to be, once. But I also wanted to be a tap dancer. No. Do you still tap dance? Mmm... Only in the shower. Are you sure you're all right? You really whacked yourself. That's okay. -Thanks. You all right, Jack? You all right, Jack? Got that meeting with Alex, got to put out the fire. All right. We're going to have to do some fancy tap dancing here. This is not my problem. Alex, we all want to work this out. That's why we're having this. You guys sit around with your designer furniture and your Italian suits, which I am probably paying for... Alex, let's not trash the suits and furniture, okay? Let's just keep it personal. You're a real stitch, you know that, Jack? Meanwhile, I am the one that is stuck with a $17,000 IRS bill. Mr. Comedian. On your advice! Alex, let's stay calm. We're all trying to help you. I hate feeling helpless, don't you? I mean, we can't even get out and push. Thanks again for sending me Phyllis's book, for thinking about me. Oh, I'm thrilled. So is she. It'll make a great movie. I really like stories where the husband and wife don't get together in the end. That's odd, isn't it? I would have pegged you for a romantic. I am a romantic, with a very strong marriage. But I think men walk best on a long leash. Have you been faithful all these years? Mmm-hmm. Maybe I lack the energy. I don't think so. I couldn't be with a man unless I loved him, but then I guess that's the difference between men and women. Okay, be honest now. Is it true my husband kicks your butt in racquetball? Your husband's a lying cad. And yes, it's true. Oh, here we are, this is me. Well, thanks again, Jack. Would you like to come in? Colin's gone off to a friend's for the week, and Scott's somewhere in Saudi Arabia, so it's just me and the chicken in the fridge. I appreciate it, but I can't. Thank you. So we'll talk. Okay. Thanks again. Yeah. Bye. Kim! I'll get the contracts to you as soon as they're drawn up. Okay. Kim! What? I have this problem, uh, accepting an invitation the first time. Don't ask. I have no idea. One of Scott's finds. Uh, no comment. Jack, did you do that? Did you say that to Alex? I'm sorry. Did I say what? You told me to take the money for the play in one lump! You asked me if you could take the money in one payment. You were desperate for it. That's what I did for you. And I am now paying through the nose to Uncle Sam, and I think it's only fair that you guys are liable for half of it. What? Jack, we agreed to make a settlement of some kind. Why? He was ready not to declare certain earnings. Jack, maybe I should take a look at the return. Barry, this is garbage. Let's just take five and cool off. Let me just tell you something. You try to get out of paying the complete, entire bill, I'm going to sue your ass off, even if my partners decide they would rather kiss it. I'm very cool. I'm going to the country, Harriet. But you just got here. Have a good weekend. You calling me a hypocrite? All right, so I'm in love with two women, but I can handle it. I can handle it, Deb. I can handle it. So I ask Helen, "Can you sum up in one sentence what the problem is?" And she says, "I don't feel loved." So I ask Herbert, "Can you love Helen "the way she asks to be loved?" -And he says, "I'm just not that kind of guy." -Oh, no. Here comes the husband. Hey, George. Yes, well, in your... But in your book, Dr. Rozenski, are you discouraging your readers from, say, expecting any possibility of that great love? -Who is this guy? That's the Love Doctor. Uh, yes and no. Let me explain. Oh, well, you'll have to explain in one minute, 'cause we are taking a break and we'll be right back. Lily, there's a lawyer here to see you. Oh. I know who that is. Jack, you're here awfully early. Didn't I tell you this was a two-part interview? Okay. What? What did he say? -He said, "Okay." Okay, all right. Well, why don't you go and have a drink, you know, come back, and then we'll all have, uh, dinner together? -Huh? He made reservations at Antonio's. George, will you please give him the damn mic? I made reservations at Antonio's. Uh-huh, good. Um... I'll try. Oh, uh, okay. Here we are. We are back once again with Harold Rozenski, doctor and also author of Love, Miracle or Myth? I am exhausted. Oh, Debbie. She peed. Oh, no. Come on. There are some rags in the trunk. I'll... She doesn't like riding in the back seat. Come on. -Oh, shit. -Yeah. What's the matter? Here. Oh... Jack, you know, I know it's painful, I mean for all of us, but... Isn't it time? She's 15. I know how old she is. She's practically blind, she has arthritis. She still scarfs down her food, and the vet says as long as she's doing that, she's all right. Oh, I'm going to take a bath. Your hair's shorter. I like it. Oh, just for the trip. It'll grow back. Andy wants me to bring some pictures of the family over to show his Dutch friends. How about his? New Year's Eve? -Oh... You are so beautiful. Oh, pooh. You are. My nose isn't that big, is it? Hmm, yeah, it is, I'd say. No, it's not. Listen, tomorrow, why don't we get away? A "what the hell" day. Hop in the car and just take off. Go somewhere, like we used to. We can't do that. I've got to pack for the trip. I woke up, you were gone. Well, I've been manicuring this one line for, oh, I don't know, three hours. I'll just scrap the whole damn poem. The perfectionist. That coffee? Last of it. Yeah, have it. I just came down to see if you were lonely. Need some comforting or something. Oh, no. That's... That's Debbie's job. She had a hard time climbing up here. Well. Beautiful night. Yeah. Jack... Hmm? I think that we should think about a separation. Maybe a divorce. Hmm. You want some toast? Uh, no. We can fix it, Lil. We can fix it if we're just honest with each other. I'm being honest. We don't have a life together. We've talked about this before. Don't we? What about last night? It's great in bed. It's wonderful. But it seems that our life depends on that. There's nothing else... Bubbling there. Lil, we have a great life together. We've got children, we've got careers. We've got a grandchild on the way. If it's good in bed, that means it's all right. For you, Jack. But there is a lot more... Look, okay, I'll tell you. When you came into the radio station yesterday, it was in your eyes. That look of galvanized determination, ready to push, make all things right. The perfect weekend... And the lovemaking was your proof. Reassurance to yourself and to me that you still love me. All right, lately I've been in low gear. I'm going through some churning at this time in my life. Um... Maybe I should move back here. Living in the city might be a mistake. It has nothing to do with living in the city, Jack. We're not growing anymore. We're just going on. What do you want, Lil? I don't know. I know that I want to be adventurous, I want to challenge myself. You can't do that with me? I don't think I can. No. I love you, Jack. I'm sorry. I don't want to hurt you, but... Is there someone else? Jack. Is there? No. There is no one else. I hate what's happening to us. Lil, let's try. Let's try. I'm sorry. I know what my crying does to you. I didn't do it to have you sling your arms around me. -I'll try harder. We should separate before we come to hate each other. Twenty-six years. This doesn't change them. Jack. Um... I'm going to get your blue boots. They're in the car. Let's see, I think I've got everything. I hope. Um... Barbara will take one look at you and she'll know that something is up. Come on. Smile. You can do it. Come on. -Oh, for heaven's sake. Now you look like your mother. -My mother? -Hi! Oh, beautiful! After 26 years, they're still laughing. -Hi. -Oh... -Hi, kids. Hey. -Oh, wonder kids! -Hi. -Thanks for taking me. -No problem. Mom, I don't need anything! You're pouring out of your shoes, honey. I mean, you know, we're water retainers. I was the same way when I was pregnant with you. So you need them, all right? You do. -Got your ticket? -Yup. Oh, I might go to Italy for a few days if I can get an interview with this Italian poet. And let me know when you're coming back. I'll pick you up. I can take a cab. It's all right, thanks. Okay, uh... Give that to Andy for his birthday and give him a hug for me, will you? -Oh, no! My passport! -What? Let me out. Oh, gosh, I wonder where I left it. Brian sold a song. -You did? -A jingle. Hey, that's great. Paper towel commercial. I mean, very profound work. That's okay, that's okay. I mean, it's better than painting houses, huh? Not to mention the dirty word, but are you two gonna get to the altar? Don't mention the "M" word. Spooks her. Look, either you're in love or you're not, you know. What's marriage got to do with it? I got it. Oh, boy. Come on, we're really gonna, be late. Ah. Oh, boy. Take care of yourself. -Okay, go on. Get outta here. -You be careful. -We will. Bye! Dad! How's the bachelor? Just, uh, checking in. If you get too lonely, call me. Jack, it's me. It's been over a week. You must be really busy at work. Your secretary's being extremely creative making up excuses for you. Maybe I should take up racquetball, huh? -Oh, here. -Thank you. Hi, stranger. What are you doing? Are you nuts? Well, Lily's out of town. What's going on, Jack? Why haven't you called? You shouldn't be calling here. Is that clear? Is that clear, Kim? Can you come over tonight? Scott got called away. Emergency summit in Philadelphia. Gone for two days. Meet me at my place at 10:00? No. In Roma at 10:00. See ya there. Now, this is more than just an affair. There's love here. I know that. That's what makes it so hard. What if she doesn't know? Can't take that chance. So you wanna just stop? Cold turkey? I don't want, Kim. Well, I can't. I'm compulsive. When I stopped smoking, I almost murdered poor little Colin. And that was just for a cigarette. Don't joke. I'm sorry. I'm just a little thrown, you know? Now, listen to me. Lil is my whole life. I don't even remember a life before. I can't let it go. But you can let me go? I'll take that for you. Scott wants me to cut down on my work. Can you believe that? I mean, he's the one with the trips. And today, on the phone, he told me he wanted me to be more available to him. I can understand that. I'm a damn good wife, you know that? And a good mother. All the conferences at school, teachers telling us what to do about Colin because he can't... Whatever. I'm there, I'm handling all that. Kim, you have so much. Why... Because 100% never seemed enough to me! I'm sorry. That sounds terrible. Come home with me tonight. Please? I can't. Please, Jack. I can't, Kim. I love you. I love you too. Jack? Hi. I'm in here. My God, Lil. Well, when did you get in? Why didn't you call me so I could come get you? I was going to go to Italy, but I changed my mind. I, uh... Too expensive, you know? -Sherry? -Oh. No, thanks. I've got... I've got my coffee. Plane was hours late. I was exhausted. So, I... I thought I'd stay here for the night. Of course, now I can't sleep, wouldn't you know. Well, how are Andy and Lisa? Happy? Andy is so happy with his job. They love their house. They're on a canal. Shutters. I mean, it's beautiful. Their marriage... They are so dear together. Oh, it's good to hear that. Well, I took a raft of photos. I'll get you copies when I get them developed. Andy loved the watch. Aw, that's great. I'm glad he did. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think I'll turn in. Okay. God, I never thought I'd be homesick for the Times. Oh, what the hell is going on, Lily? Aren't we supposed to talk about this, besides Andy's shutters and the Times? We have talked about it. No, we haven't talked about it. We've talked around it. All right, so no anger, right? Jesus, I feel neutered. I don't want your anger. Well, there is anger there, Lily. There is anger there! I'm angry that you're just willing to throw away 26 years! I'm angry about... Damn it. That you won't even give me the respect to fight about it. Aren't you angry? All right, you want... You want me to be angry? I don't like you sailing in here at 3:00 in the morning and bulldozing me. I am not good at street fighting with you. Oh, you are. We've had plenty of rounds, and we've thrashed them out, and we've always come up with some kind of agreement. Well, I'm not angry about anything now, Jack. That loving politeness. That's what we've got left. Now that he's pissed off, we're pissed off. Wilson sides with you, and he's willing to go to court on it. It's basically moot because Alex has picked up Withers' account and left. He's going over to Arkin and Wendell. Lily wants a separation. Separation? I'm sorry to hear that. When did this happen? Before she left for Europe. Tough stuff. Tough stuff. When my separation went sour... No, toxic, I was devastated. But I'll tell you something, it turned out for the best. That's right. Judy and I have something now I never even dreamed of before with Doris. I keep thinking about all the "what if" stuff, you know. What if I... Why didn't I... What if I had done this, or that? Listen, I got a call last week from someone who asked me to recommend a co-chairman for a seminar. Somebody dropped out at the last minute. This summer at Brimley. My alma mater. You interested? Get away. Clear your head out a little. Huh? A little sabbatical. I don't know. This has got to work out. Just got to work out, all of it. It's just for the summer. It's no good for me here. A possibility I will go nuts. Brimley? Why Brimley? Uh, there's a faculty position open this summer. I went to school there. That's where I met Lily and married her. -Is she going? -Uh-uh. -You're going alone? -Yeah. It's my fault. I've been terrible for you. Ungiving and moody... No, no, none of that now. Jack, turn around. Okay, girls, come on. -What? The next exhibit. A teacher from Colin's school. Jill and Janelle, no more talking. Here we go. These are muskox. Anybody know what they eat, huh? Well, I'm sure there'll be lots of Brimley girls with long, dirty blonde hair, gleaming white teeth and perky breasts. Oh, stop it. I'm just gonna go there to teach, Kim. Oh, yes, sir. Professor, sir. Uh, teacher from Colin's school? Wasn't her. You turned on my life. I almost wish you hadn't. I know there'll be other women. I'm not gonna be threatened. You have the summer to yourself. I give my men a long leash. Mmm. Imagine. At my age, scared. Well, Deb... This is where it all started. Nothing's changed. Well, almost nothing. The toilet's a bummer sometimes. Just fill the tank up with water and it'll flush. Um, the air conditioner does work. It has two settings, freezing and off. You mentally stable? Relative to what? My last sublet. He offed himself, can you believe it? Right in the bed, he gassed himself. The oven. I took it out. I can understand why. But there's a microwave. Look, I'm stable. You don't have to worry about that. How big is the microwave? Just joking. I'm leaving the number of my shrink on the wall. Just in case. I have lots of friends here. I'm going to leave her number anyway. Okay, uh, these places deliver. And don't order anything but pizza from the pizza place. Okay. That's it. You okay? Any questions? Uh, I think you covered it. Good, you'll be fine. Uh, listen, don't hesitate to call if you feel the least bit depressed. I promise. -So, have fun. -Hmm, thanks. -Nice dog, by the way. -Thanks. I read your thesis on copyright law when I was a student here. -Quite excellent. -Well, thanks. -Nervous? -No. Well, maybe a little. Don't be. They're gonna love you. Want an introduction? Uh, what do you think? Ah, sometimes it breaks the ice a little, or you could just dive right in. Well, I think I'll dive right in. Get it over with. All right. Good choice. Jack Montgomery. Copyright law. When I was a student here, I met a girl not too far from here, about a block, uh... And I was smitten with her, but I was too shy to ask her out for a date. So I, uh... I found out where her dormitory was and I sent her a telegram. Um, the telegram. "I met you today, I hope you remember "My speech was confused, it was a curious timbre. "I loved you instantly, but you were distant and cruel "If you don't join me for dinner, I'll drop out of school." Well, I did get a date, but I didn't get the girl. A very good friend of mine did, however. I was over at his apartment, oh, a month or so later and I... I noticed there was a telegram on his desk. And I looked at the telegram and, by golly, it was a telegram from that girl. And I read it and it said... You guessed it. "I met you today..." "I hope you remember." It was that moment that I decided to specialize in copyright law. Right. All right, let's get to work. You're good, man. You're really savvy. I don't know, but that was fun! Good, good. So, Friday there's a summer faculty party. I guess I'll see you there. -Bring your wife. -Nah, she's not here. Oh, yeah? When's she coming up? Oh. Uh, we're... We're separated. Just. -How are you doing? Well, you know, I mean, the reason I asked is I've got a friend just split from his wife, and she's an iron lady. I mean, really, really, ugly. Uh, well... Look, if you get lonely, you know, this is the place. It's a real merry-go-round of parties, always. Stale cookies, sour wine and hungry singles. Separated, divorced or just shopping. That's not what I need right now. Thanks. Well, feel free to call on me. As your teaching assistant, I'm here to make sure you have everything you need. How old are you? Thirty-four. Why? You been married? Almost. Still looking for Miss Right. Good. Catch you at the party. Hey, Jack. You made it. -Glad you came. -How you doing, Ted? Eh, pretty stiff event, but there's a few interesting people. Let me introduce you around. Hey, Lynn. -Oh, hi! -How you feeling? How are you, Ted? Lynn Rogers, this is, uh, Jack Montgomery. Hi. -Nice to meet you. -You, too. Jack is a guest professor for the summer. Very cool guy. Oh. How's it going? Great. Uh, listen, uh, let me round up my date. I want her to meet ya. Ted doesn't give the wine at these events four stars, but this isn't bad, is it? -No, it's not bad. -Mmm. The cookies are good. Uh, no, thanks. Oh, oh, no. These are for my kid. I don't stuff myself. Believe me, I'm... I think it's important to put your best foot forward. You know, I've gotten rid of the toxic people in my life, and I'm a positive person as a result, a very positive person. That's good. Especially since my divorce. Ted tells me you're separated. He did? Well, we'll probably get back together. That's what I thought. Where is Ted? -Good morning, my friend. -Ted. Saturday, it's sunny, and that means softball. You need to get out, Jack. What position you play? I haven't played baseball in... Softball, softball, not baseball. What are you, a polar bear? It's freezing in here. No wonder you're so depressed. This place is macabre. All right, well, we'll get some java on the way. Come on, come on, get dressed. Oh-ho. I think your next door neighbors are going at it. What the hell you looking at? Here we go. Great. Little higher. Nice warm-up. Come on. Hit the target. Time. Time! Aim for the top of my glove, all right? Here, not here. -Don't worry, I'll find the ball. -What's your name? -Jack. Janet. Hey, batter, batter! Come on, Jack. Come on, you can do it. Right here. Come on. Right here. I find you very attractive. Beauty! Strike one! -I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Come on, no more, batter! Way to go! Did I do it or what? Oh, man. A lot of runs this time. Where did you learn to play ball? Uh, my dad. He was a baseball nut. And five brothers. Hey, Ted, good catch out there. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Yeah, not bad, not bad. Where did you get this guy? Uh, I'm not allowed to tell you. -So don't. Jack's guest teaching at a seminar, but when he's in the city, Jack is this very distinguished lawyer. No, you're kidding. That's fabulous. Wish I had a distinguished lawyer. Why would you need a lawyer? Mmm. I did. My divorce. My lawyer was too busy with his own divorce. -Way to go! Oh, yes! Go! This is the nest of the separated or divorced. Have you noticed? Well, add me to the list. Oh, no. No! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I shouldn't laugh. What stage are you in? I'm, uh... Oh, wow. That's terrible. Was it ugly? Mine was very ugly. Of course, he was having an affair. Pushing me to do the same. Well, I did. Mainly just to even the score. What is the score, by the way? We're down four. Yeah, anyway, we're in court and I'm claiming he was unfaithful, and he's claiming that I had three lovers. Actually, it was two, and one of them was impotent, so, I mean, he shouldn't count, should he? Oh, I shouldn't think so. Exactly, see? You should've handled my case. He hurt me. And he's malicious. I was just vengeful. All right. You're up, slugger. -Up. -Get one. Homer. Just get on base, don't try to murder it. Oh, eat my shorts, Ted. You just get on base, I'm gonna whack one. I can find out for ya. Uh-uh. -Whoo-hoo! Oh, that's impressive. Hi. Here you are. Here I am. Mmm. Well, I just came by to see if I could call you sometime, um... Maybe see ya? You are seeing me. Yeah, I am. Well, I thought I might, uh, be able to take you out to dinner. That is, if you're not involved. No, no, no. No, no. Those three lovers are not hanging around. Two. No. No, they're not. Well, let me give you a card. I play gigs for extra money. Hotel lobbies and cocktail lounges. Could I take you out for lunch today? Oh, I can't. I have to pick up my kids. Or maybe some other time then, okay? -Some other time. -Okay. Listen, I have something to tell you. What? I don't remember your name. Uh, Jack. Look what we got here, Deb. Come on, let's see what we got. Ah. It's from Kim. She says she loves me. -Mmm, goodnight, honey. Hello. Yeah, hello? Hello? Oh, God. Hey, hershiser! -Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, yeah. -These stupid brakes... -Hi. So, you never called. Uh, well, I've been kind of busy with my class. Liar. All right, you didn't seem very interested. I'm not. I mean, interested in getting involved, but, hell, I'll have dinner with ya. How about tonight? -Can't. -See? I'm working. I told you I'm a working girl. How about after? I can't. I've got the kids, the babysitter... Oh. Anything kicks out of your schedule, you give me a call, all right? Let me take a look here. Let's see. Can't, can't, can't, can't. Can't, can't, can't. Monday! There's a recital reception for Vladimir Spivakov, he's a Russian violinist. I go ape for Russian violinists. Okay. Listen, could I shower and change at your place after exercise class? It would save me a trip to go home, and... Yeah, I'm just three minutes from here, behind Swenson Hall. Great. -7:00-ish? -Dinner after? Well... Okay, never mind, never mind. Spivakov, 7:00-ish, my place, shower, put that in the book. Some things I can remember. -See you then. -Okay. -Fix those brakes. Hey, hey! Get down from there. Come on, get down, Deb. That's not... Ah. Would you like something to drink? Some white wine? Oh, wine would be great. Do you have any ice? My refrigerator gets tired in the summer. It refuses to make ice. Luxury. -We've got ice. -Great. Wow, that was record time. With my schedule, you have no choice. Mmm. Pate? Uh, no, thank you. -Hmm. Okay. Yeah, you look... You look terrific. Thanks, so do you. I mean those clothes really come off on you. I mean, you look great in them, is what I meant. Well, we better get going or we're gonna be late. Okay. -Oh, uh... -Sorry. Mmm. Slow, slow, slow. I wanted to kiss you the moment you walked in. I don't wanna fall in love with you. You won't. Hello. Oh, hi. I have been trying you. You've been very busy, huh? Lily. Uh, how are you? I'm fine. Jack, um... There's a little house that I saw that was for rent. And I just... I decided I would take it in the fall. The agent wanted to know if we wanted to rent ours. I didn't know, I... He said maybe even sell it. Jack, what do you think? Jack? Hi, what's up? I just wanted to see you. Wanna see me for lunch? I, uh... Play, uh... -Oh, geez. -Let me just listen, okay? No, no, no, no, no. I'd be too self-conscious. I'm not gonna let you stand there and watch me play. No. I'm a fly on the wall. -That was nice. Mmm. I could fall in love with you. Don't say that. -Why not? -Just don't. Why? Because we just met. And it doesn't mean anything. Well, it means I care about you. What? -Where are you going? -Ugh, Jack, I am... You go too fast, you push too hard. This was a summer fling, a romp, a roll. In August it's back to the city, those were the terms. Janet... I don't get it. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Hi. Mom, it's a man! -What do you want? It's all right, honey, he's a friend of mine from school. Go play, all right? Hello. So you do sleuth work on the side? She's very pretty. Where's your son? Napping. -Tough day at the playground. Uh... Look, I apologize for the other night, and I promise I won't say what I said again. I'm not inviting you inside. Why not? Because every guy that comes through this door, including the plumber, the kids wanna make into Daddy. Okay, how about a walk? All right. You gotta carry a wrench to take a walk with me? I was fixing the refridge. And yes, maybe I do. I happen to be good with refrigerators. And, um... Most appliances, leaky faucets, showerheads, toilets... Yeah, yeah, yeah, Mr. Fix-It. Thanks, but no thanks. Can I ask you a personal question? You drove all the way out here, you should at least get your mileage worth. What are you afraid of? In two sentences? Getting hurt again and hurting my kids. I understand that. Did you ever love somebody so much that it scared you? Dick was my first and only. I was... I was so very young, and... I used to watch this guy sleep and I would just cry. I guess from the fear that something so intense and so perfect could end. And it did. They say you're lucky if you find that kind of love even once in your life. Have you? I think so. Yes, I have. I'm glad for you. How do you feel about frozen yogurt? You're not gonna compare intense love with frozen yogurt, are you? No! Just all this talk about the past is making me hungry. We can take my kids. -Kids? You think they're, uh, safe? Mention frozen yogurt, they won't even notice that you're there. My treat? Dutch. Dutch. Okay, don't forget to put that ribbon on there, too, okay? Okay, new deal. Now, Tchaikovsky wants to copyright his 1812 Overture today, and it's never been copyrighted, but he cannot do that. Why? -Because he's dead. Yes, that's true. But if he wasn't, the work was first published in 1880, so the protection rights on it would've expired anyway, 50 years max after Tchaikovsky's death. All right, now... If Joe Schmoe, on the other hand, wanted to copyright his 1992 arrangement of 1812 Overture, this he can do. Why? Because the 1992 arrangement is a new creation. Excellent. Yeah. That's right. So, college agrees with you, huh? What you laughing at? The look on your face when you saw me in the back of the class. I was surprised. I certainly wasn't expecting to see you. Of course you were surprised. That was the whole idea, silly. Number 7. Come on in. Oh, my God. Hey, Debbie, look who's here. Hi, Deb, how you doing? Hey, how you doing? Can we come in? You guys stay there, I'll be right back. Heads up! -Excuse me. Here. Check it out. Yeah! Jack, I think there's someone knocking at the door. Jack? Jack? Jack? Oh, hi. I'm sorry, I was taking a nap. Thanks for the thought. Here's the receipt. Tell them to take it back. What? Don't be silly. You need a refrigerator. Would you slow down? And I'll get a refrigerator when I'm ready. Quiet. People are trying to sleep here. What is this? Siesta time? It's 4:00 in the afternoon. Zip your fly. A refrigerator. How romantic. You knew this was gonna happen. You said it. I knew there would be others. I didn't know there would be one... With a refrigerator. God, this is so silly for me to be upset, you know, you take your chances, you pay the price. I never should have come. Kim, I'm sorry, I... What's her name? Please, tell me her name. Janet. -How old is she? -Thirty-two. Oh, that's nice. Will you stop this? I love you very much... Oh, I know, you're doing all the things with her you couldn't do with me, right? Shopping, dining with friends, staying all night, and making love again in the morning? Oh, God, I can't believe I'm saying this. Well, never again. Never again, do you hear me, do I leave myself wide open like this for some cute thing with long dirty hair and hoop earrings. What you want is impossible, Kim. Scott and I simultaneously, each in his own compartment. It's a... It's a thrill. It's a drug. There's no future in that. What if I could change things? What do you mean by that? You know exactly what I mean. No, I don't think you want that. And what do you want, Jack? Hmm? I love you. You told me the same. Answer it. No, I don't have to. I don't care, answer it. -No. -Go on. -Hello. Jack, it's me. Lily. I'll be there in two hours. -ICU? -Right there. Jack. -How is she doing? -She's... She's still hemorrhaging, and they're monitoring the baby. Well, I have the same blood that she has if she needs a donor. I just spoke to the doctor. They're gonna decide by tomorrow whether... If they're gonna operate to try and stop the bleeding. Maybe go in early and take the baby. And where is she now? She's sedated. They're working on her in there, but we can't go in right now. You okay? Yeah. She's gonna be fine. Just fine. Barbie's got more determination and stubbornness than you and I combined. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you should get some rest. You want a sleeping pill? We might have some. Well, I'll be in Andy's room. I'll be down the hall if you want me. Jack? Mmm-hmm? Stay with me, please? -Yes. Bri? -What? We have a granddaughter. -How are they doing? -They're fine. Barb... Barbara had a C-section. Seven pounds, one ounce, 20 inches long. -Wow. -Oh, thank God. -I'm a grandfather. -Hey, boy. How you doing? -Oh, honey. How are you? Did you see the baby? Oh, God, she's so beautiful. How you feeling, darling? -I think I missed the whole thing. Can you tell her not to do that again? You know she never listens to us anyway. Hi, Daddy. Hi, baby. You won't believe the first thing she said after she came to. That was not the first thing. Okay, okay. Not too long after she delivered the baby, she said... "Would you marry me?" I told her I'd get back to her on it. Well, you better water these pumpkins a lot this week. We're gonna have a party this Thanksgiving. Jack, um... The real estate man thinks he has a buyer for the house. If... If we're interested, you know. I didn't know what your plans were. Well, I spent almost the whole summer away, trying to think it through, and, uh... Succeeded in coming up with absolutely nothing. Yeah. Was it a good summer? Oh, there were good days, bad days, like real life. How about you? The truth? It was hard. Sometimes lonely. It's driven me to think about a lot of things. What I wanna do. I mean, it's been... A good part, you know. Period of adjustment. Well... I have been invited to come back and teach a class this fall. That's great. People wonder why the educational system is going down the toilet. Oh, stop it. That's very flattering, you know. Oh, I am considering it. Well, more like fantasizing it. Why not? My career, why not. Your career. If you enjoy it, do it. I mean, you must be good at it, or they wouldn't want you back. Well, it is seductive. I gotta get to the studio. Um... I'll put your name on this too, okay? I appreciate your being here. Ah, somewhere on... On a turnpike, I don't know, I'll be back about 8:00, I guess. How's Debbie? Glad you called, but it's a different kind of problem. Why? What's... What's wrong with her? I'm afraid she's got hip dysplasia. It's very hard for her to carry her own weight. Well, she is eating better, though. I can help her out. She's got a lot of discomfort. I think it might be time to put her to sleep. I... Just came by to... She's not doing too well. They want to put her down, but I just... I'm sorry I haven't called. I've been through a lot lately, and I... Um... I'm leaving at the end of the week, and I just came by to see if you were here and to... Tell you I missed you. You're killing me with this stuff. Wanna stay for dinner? That's it, yeah, pull it right in. Like that? Ah, and when you throw it forward, throw it, point your elbow where you're going to throw it, okay? -Okay -Let's see it. -Oh, never mind. I don't have to tell you a thing. All right, who wants rare? I do! Well, too late. High one, okay? Well, um, Jesse, the new guy, that lives down the street... Mmm-hmm. He chased all the girls, and looking down their pants, so she... He had to go in the office, and everybody was talking about it. So, um, we, um... We made this little plan that we'd tell our teacher that, um, Jesse was just doing that for fun, but he was doing that on purpose. Lucy was really mad. So we decided... Jack. -Time to get up. -Mmm. Kids will be up in a few hours, and they shouldn't see anything. It was a great day. You have wonderful kids. Yeah. What if I was to say I'd stay here, move up here. Are you saying that or just testing the waters? How would you feel about that? You're testing the waters. It's been a preoccupation of mine all summer. Well, why don't you ask yourself what you want? What if I say I want you? What if, what if, what if, what if. All right. I want to say "I love you" and you to believe me. Stop it. I mean it. Stop playing with me. Why can't you believe me? Why should I believe someone who says they want me when they don't know what they want? And what about me? What do I want? Is that... Do I love you? Do you care? You needed somebody to grab onto, and there I was. Instant relationship. It was a wonderful summer, but now it's over. You are so damn cavalier, Janet. You know that? Just keep busy, keep moving. Fill your book up. Don't feel a thing. You got your kids. You built your fortress. What the hell do you care about anything else? You're gonna wake up the kids. -Help me. I can't make decisions for you that only you can make yourself, Jack. So, what... What do we do? Go home. Home. Whatever that is. Thanks for everything, by the way. Ah, no problem. Guess I'm not gonna find me another softball partner, right? Yeah, I guess so. Listen, you taking 'em up on that fall gig? You should, you know. You're not half bad. Thank you. I don't think so. My partners would frown on it. Sure. Listen... Thanks for everything, huh? No problem, man. Be good, Deb. Hey, Deb, get in there. -Move over, now. -I'm driving. -She wants to drive home. -She'll be glad to get home. Yeah, she loves driving. She knows she's going home. Oh, yeah, and I'll send you those test scores. I need you to sign them, all right? -Okay. -Okay. -Okay, take care. -You too. Bye-bye. Oh, Debbie, you're going to have to diet. Ah, I should've had that knob fixed. Surprise! Did you do this? Happy birthday, Dad. Oh, my... Actually, it was pretty cool. They had these little paper towel rolls. Pixilation animation, it's called. And these little paper towel rolls were dancing to my music. You got paid for that, huh? Yeah, a little bit. This is my wife, Kim. -Hi, Kim. -Hello. -Nice to meet you. -Glad you could come. Jack, you look terrific. You rested? You don't even want to see your desk. It's a mountain of work. How did it go? Oh, happy 50 by the way. And 50 more. Ah, thank you, Oliver. It was a great experience, really. You looking forward to coming back to work? -Well, actually... -Here's your drink, love. Oh, thanks a lot, sweetheart. I have to tell you, Jack, these friendly, schizophrenic separations make me very nervous. I mean, it's so much easier for everybody if the couple really hate each other. I'm sorry, Judy, we never really considered that. I'm only kidding. What happened to you? I love your house. Yeah, it's nice, isn't it? I've been surprising you a lot these days, haven't I? Yeah, it seems so. She's lovely. -Lily. -Yes. Yes, she is. -Well, how are you? -Fine, really. Great. Thanks. Work is driving me nuts, of course, but Scott and I are having a renaissance. We've rededicated ourselves to each other. Good. He's even taking Colin and me on a working vacation to Caracas, wherever the hell that is. And I owe it all to you and Lily. I'm glad. I really am. Hey! Birthday boy. -Thank you. -Oh, Scott, good to see ya. I was just trying to persuade Jack to do a walk-on on my little movie, but he's playing hard to get. Did she tell you that we're going to Caracas? She did. It sounds great. Listen, when I get back, we play. Hmm? That's... That's a good idea, Scott. Yeah. Listen, I've got to restock that bar out there, so, uh... Get out the case of... Cheers. Not hungry, huh? Not eating anything. Well, that's all right. You'll have a big breakfast tomorrow, right? We're starting. We're ready to do the cake. I'll find him. Oh, honey, use the plates in the hutch, okay? Oh! Wonderful party. Oh, thank you. I'm glad you could make it. Did you know Jack and I are working together? No, I didn't know that. Mmm-hmm. He's doing a little legal work for me. Ah. He's just... Brilliant. He really is, isn't he? Have you seen him? -Oh, I think he went into the kitchen. -Uh-huh. Okay. Thanks. I'll see you later on. Oh, Larry! I'm such a klutz. Hi. -You all right? -Mmm-hmm. It's a great party, you know. Thanks. I always wanted to give you a surprise party. What are you doing out here? We're just about to cut the cake. You didn't water the pumpkins, Lil. They're dead. Oh, God. I'm sorry. The nights we'd come out here... We used to come out here and make love in the summer. Wonderful lovemaking. Except for the spiders. I remember. Spiders. How could you let go so easily, selling the place? Oh, come on. Not easily. It's not easy. It's not easy letting go. I saw you in there. So happy. Effervescent. Cinderella at her own ball. I saw you as though looking through a window, standing on the outside. You have your own light, Lily. You don't need me, do you? It's not that. Our needs for each other have changed. But I can't let go. Jack, sometimes things just give out, you know. They just get worn out. And you have to let go. 'Cause they can't be repaired, no matter how much you want to keep them. I don't want to settle sensibly. We don't have to short-change our lives. We deserve more than that. I love you, Lily. I will always love you, Jack. That will never change. We've had 26 of the best years that anybody could possibly have. Thanks. We don't think... Let go, my dear Jack. Let go. You'll be okay. Yeah. Debbie... What do we talk about at a time like this? What do we say? Just be a matter of seconds after I give her the shot. Are you ready? No. Oh, my God. Hey, hershiser. I heard you were back in town. Yeah. For the year. Well, good for Brimley. So... Want to have dinner tonight? Oh, I can't tonight. But let me check my book. Very funny. I can't Tuesday, but how about Wednesday, Thursday or Friday? Okay. Which one? Well, how about Wednesday, Thursday and Friday? Okay. Put me in your book. Some things I remember. Smart ass.
