Good morning, darlings. Did you sleep well? Here's another cute little one. Maksim ... Good morning, darling. You woke up at the same time as the sun. Let's get up. Give me a high-five. Are you awake? Give me your ear. Are you awake? Or are you a sleepyhead? Zhenya, I can only wake you up with water. Good morning, little beautiful darling. It's just me. - Mrs. Irina! - It's me, it's me. How are you going to be woken up? Little Yulia... Are you waking up? - How clever you are! You're up. - Yes, you are. Oh, that's great! Hurry up and get dressed. There's morning gymnastics. Good morning, good morning! Seryozha, stretch your arms up towards the sun! One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. The beetle wakes up! Well done, everyone. Here comes the train. Go, go, go... Push with both legs. One ... Push to my feet, Maksim. One, two. Swing my legs like a tree in windy weather. Here we go! One, two, three, four. Well done! The number you are calling, cannot answer your call. Send a text message or try again later. Hello, hello, hello. - Hi, Granny. - Hello, Granny. - How's it going? - It's going fine. - How about you, my darling? - I'm fine, I'm fine. Is Mommy drinking again? I haven't seen her, Eva. I haven't heard from her for three days. I have tried to call her, but she doesn't answer the phone. - Not at all? - That means she's drunk again, right? Damn it, damn it. I have to go there. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. - Bye, bye, bye. See you later. ... deprivation of parental responsibility, which will be implemented... It is best to have a deprivation, because it is not optimal to have an orphanage. She deserves a good foster family. - A good family. - Yes, as I said, we will try. Okay, thank you for that. We'll be in touch. Bye, bye, bye. Here in eastern Ukraine - - people can still feel the echoes of war. Life has always been hard here, but the war has made it even worse. So many people have lost their jobs. Now there is a broken family behind every tenth door. When a family breaks up - - because of alcohol, violence or homelessness - - social workers take the children bring them here. To our residential institution. The number you have called, cannot answer your call. Send a text message. - What does your mom do? - Drinking. Do you miss her? I want her to stop, so we can start again together. That may well happen. Last time she was sober for five months, or maybe it was three. - It could be that ... - Last year she succeeded. And you hope, that you will succeed again this year? Yes, I hope so. She's a good mom, except for the drinking, right? Eva is here for the second time. Our residential institution is only a temporary solution. The children can only stay here for up to nine months. - while their cases are being heard in court. In the meantime, we make sure they have a warm bed and six meals a day. And we make sure they get to school. Hands first. One, two, three. One, two, three. And then like this: One, two, three ... Are you ready? All the men are watching on the dance floor. While I dance proudly to myself. I go right to the limit. You hurt me again. I know it's my own fault. My body and soul hurts. That's how sick I am with you. And now I am struck again by that fever. The short numbers are playing here in the nightclub. And I'm starting to forget you. To the beat of a sad dance I let go of our love. Only here I can Dance away all my pain. Like in a giant spider's web I spread my memories of you. In the neighborhood they gossip that I I'm your girlfriend. What a load of bullshit. I love you, I love you. I love you so much... Please, please love me. Eva blushes. Look how nicely we have we've laid it all out for them. Girls, girls ... Girls ... Oh no, no, no! - Oh, no! Oh, no! - Don't be afraid. Boys, go to your room. There's... Girls, well ... Just don't read it out loud. - It's for you. - What's up? - Dudnik, Yulia loves you. - I don't love anyone. How stupid I am! - Is it dark? - I'll turn it off. Okay, turn it on. Try to pretend there's someone under the bed right now. - There is no one there. - Pretend! What if he crawls out? What if he kills you in the night! Here is my worst story. Once my father went on a drinking binge. Every time my father drinks too much, he starts hitting my mom... - or me. Well, I was little then, and my mother had just been paid. He had been drinking and got into a fight with her. - Then he stabbed her in the chest. - With a knife? Yes, he did. - Was there a lot of blood? - Yes, a whole pool. She gasped for breath and fell, crying, poor thing! Five years later he was released and begged for forgiveness. He even went down on his knees to her. When she forgave him, he bought champagne and cake. The same day he got drunk again. Drunk fathers are stupid, and he is always drunk. - Wild, wild, wild! - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I also have a story about my father. He was also drunk... Eva has been here for almost nine months. If the court deprives her mother of the custody of her mother - Eva will be placed in an orphanage. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'll say. Wow, wow, wow. We still have a chance - - to find a relative or foster family for her to stay with. Our last hope is - that Eva's grandmother can become her guardian. - Hello, hello, hello. - Hello, hello, hello. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Hi, sweetheart. - How are you? - I've met a young man. Young man? Only 31 years old. He's much too young for you, mom! Eva, I'm sorry to be alone. So am I. - Let me make it all right. - How do you do that? I'll find a job, and then everything will be fine at home. I want you to come back. Get out of there and come back to me! - Are you crazy? - Just get out of there. If dad was still alive, this would never have happened. - Stop it, stop it, stop it. - Don't start, Eva. Eva, my darling, why are you killing me? What about me, sitting here crying alone? I am all alone. No one comes to visit me. What would you prefer? Live with mom or grandma? - Grandma. - With grandma? - Because your mom hasn't changed. - No, not at all. This is how it works: First there is a hearing in court. Your mother will be summoned to that. - She has already received a letter. - Yes, a summons. But she was too lazy to to pick it up at the post office. So the summons? I see what you mean. She doesn't correct anything. She doesn't bother to change - - or get things right. - You've called your father, haven't you? - Uh, yeah, I did. He's coming. But he's been missing before. So tomorrow you have to go to the orphanage. - Which one? - Kremenskoye. Question. How many times have you called your father this week? - I don't know, I don't know. - Once or twice? - Two or three times. - Two or three times? - And he hasn't visited you? - No, he hasn't. I understand, I understand. But do you know - - if Eva Majinska's grandmother has spoken to the social services? Has there been a consultation on the deprivation of parental custody? The thing is, time is running out. And we have a grandmother, who visits her after all. - The case is being processed ... - Yes, I know that. - So maybe there will be news tomorrow? - Yes, there will be. - May I come in? - Yes, you may. Do you remember our talk yesterday? - We talked about your grandmother. - Yes, we did. - I put buckles in. - I always straighten that bangs. - Yeah, I put the barrettes in. - Good, good, good, good. Today I have spoken with Anjelika from the social services. I have good news. Tomorrow you will be picked up by your grandmother. So it all worked out. - Is she coming tomorrow? - Yes, tomorrow. Everything will be fine. - It's going to be so good. - I had a feeling about it. Last night I dreamt about grandma. I'm shaking all over ... All is well. All is well. - Is it really true? - Yes, it's true. I wouldn't lie to you. I'm so happy! - Do you know when you have to leave? - Around 13 o'clock. - Close your eyes. - And open your mouth? No, open your eyes now. It's for you. Wow, wow, wow. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. - Oh, Eva. - Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm blushing all over... Thank you, thank you, thank you. The bear will take care of you. - Are you nervous? - Yes, I'm nervous. Just remember, you can always call, around the clock. - Are you listening? - Yes, I'm listening. Don't forget us. I won't either. Remember, you can do anything. Keep on being the quiet and calm girl you are. You remind me of a butterfly. Don't cry or I'll start too. - Do you hear me? - Yes, I hear you. Dearest Eva, today you are coming home! It's going to be alright. Grandma is here to take you home. - Don't cry. - Now get out of here! I find it hard to believe that she can take me with her. That's it, sweetie. Bye-bye, bye-bye. - Where are you going? - I'm going home. Bye, bye, bye. - Eva... - Goodbye, Eva. - Can I call you daughter now? - Yes, you may. We'll be home soon. - Did you miss it, Eva? - Yes, I missed it. This is a nice blouse. These pants are really trendy. And they have holes in them. How trendy they are! - That's what all grandmothers say. - Yes, they do. - We shouldn't hurry. Very slowly. - Slowly, slowly. Yes, Eva. Very slowly. When one child leaves, another arrives. Because of winter and war we have more children than ever before. Be quiet, children! - The next one is for Alexandra Burdina. - This is Sasha. - There you go, there you go. - Thank you very much, thank you very much. Sasha skipped school. No one saw her for a long time. Her mother is an alcoholic and often went out drinking. She left Sasha to herself for days. Sasha had to cook and do everything herself. Katenka, sing a song for us. - Katenka. - I love you, I love you. I miss you already. So sing for me. What's wrong with her? Katenka, will you sing a song? I didn't understand that. Say it again. - Sing a song! - Yes, of course you can. - Shall we be friends? - Yes, we shall. Or maybe not. What will you do, if I say "yes" or "no"? Katenka? I feel so lonely. Then maybe I don't want to be friends with you ... That's nice to hear. But I said I don't want to be friends with you. I'm staying far away. I'm serious! I don't want to be friends for a whole day. You're really fucking with me. I didn't understand that. Say it again. Again? Do you want to sing a song? Give me something to eat. Hello, ma'am. This is Anjelika Nikolajevna. Sasha came to me recently. Sasha Burdina came to me. You wouldn't happen to have her mother's phone number, do you? - She wants to talk to her mother. - No, she doesn't. - She hasn't even contacted us. - She hasn't? No, she hasn't. Not once since her child was placed. As far as I can understand, a lot of unpleasant things have happened. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Goodbye again. What a load of crap! That's it, that's it, that's it. Now I've wiped the door and the handle. Kolya, stop drawing on the doors. - Is that a deal? Kolya? - Yes, it's a deal. Then I got out of that. I'm afraid of the dark, but when I ran away from the residential institution, it was snowing. So it was very, very bright. But I was not afraid, because Vlad was with me. We saw seven police cars, but they didn't stop. Vlad is so tall, they probably thought he was an adult. We parted ways close to the stadium and the Knight's Park. I hurried inside and thought: "Finally I'm home." Then my stepfather, Vanya, shouted: "Kolya has run home." From there it went from bad to worse. Already after an hour the police showed up. I had seen that coming. I only ran away to see my mom, siblings, stepfather and grandparents. I don't care about anything else. Kolya often runs away from home. He wanders the streets, while his mother and stepfather are out drinking. The police caught him with his two younger siblings - while they were searching a junkyard for items that could be sold. Oops, damn it! - Do you really want to go home? - Uh, yeah, I do. I even want to go to school. - Speak nicely. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - How many hours have you been skipping school? - Me? - All in all... - How many exactly? - How many absences have you had? - Measured in days or hours? I went to school one day, but I wasn't there for all the lessons. - Wipe it off, Kolya. - Why is that? - Why do you draw the ugly things? - It's cool. - It's gone now. - What does it say, Kolya? - Nothing, nothing, nothing. - Show it to me. - What does it mean? - I don't know what it means. - Then why did you write it? - No reason. - I copied it from the boys. - Uh, what? Copied it. - From Vlad? - Uh, no, no, no. I'm not a snitch. - Who then? - We don't betray our own. Why do you talk like a, who is in prison? - Do you think the word "Joker" will get you home? - Yes, that's my souvenir from here. Kolya, you talk to me, like I'm a little girl. Do you think that bad behavior will help you get home? Yes, because Mrs. Anjelika gets a lot of complaints. Then she goes crazy and sends me home. You think you've figured it out. But you haven't. Please wipe it off. Kolya? You are the oldest child. You are the oldest. Who can your mother count on? - Uh, me. - Well, uh... Listen to me. I don't want you to stay here any longer than necessary. You think I don't care about you? What do you think? - I don't know, I don't know. - You don't know? Kolya, clean yourself up and wash your hand. Deal? - Can I have my marker? - Show me a clean hand first. - How should I clean it? - With soap, of course. - Come back and show me. - It's evil! - Hi, Mommy! - Hello, dear Zhenya. - How are you, darling? - I'm fine. - I've missed you guys so much. - I miss you too. I'll try to come visit tomorrow if I can. That would be great. Kristina wants to talk to you. - Okay, put her on the phone. - It's me, mom. - Hi, sweet Kristina. - Hi, sweet Kristina. - Are you okay, honey? - Yes, I'm fine. Is that right, honey? Are the others being hard on you? Yes, they are. That Zhenya guy beats me. - What's that? Our own Zhenya beats you? - Hi, Mommy. The others fight so much. They fight like crazy, Mom. It's terrible. They've just started again. Please be quiet! Why are they fighting? They are arguing about, who I spend more time with. Oh, that's right. And you must be the big brother? - Yes, as usual. - Mom, Kolya. - So it's better than being at home? - What's better than being at home? - Mom, Zhenya is beating. - What do you say? - Is it better than being at home? - No, it's not. See you, mom. I'll see you soon. I'll come tomorrow. Good night, ma'am. Say goodbye to mom. - Bye, bye, bye! - Bye, sweethearts. Goodbye, mom. Kristina! There you go, there you go. Put your shoes on. Hey, hey, hey, hey! - Are you comfortable here? - I'm fine. You smell like alcohol, mom. - Not so much, but still. - How are you, darling? - Good, good, good. - Let's sit down. - I've been in fights with a lot of people. - Is that a bruise? - Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Who did it? - Just someone. - Typical boys. But it's a bad thing. I've made some drawings. Look at this. - Do you know what that sign means? - No, I don't. It's a thief symbol. I've made a lot of them. Look at this one. - His hand is dirty. - Yeah, it's dirty. Because he's bored. - Look at this. - Zhenya! - What was that? Go on, say it. - Nothing, nothing. - What are you doing? - Nothing, nothing, nothing. Go on, tell me. Are those scars on your hand? Come here, come here. - What? Uh... - Sit down here. Are those scars? Did you cut yourself? Don't ever do that again. I need you. I can't do without you. I would miss you. I can't do it alone. Do you understand? - Do you understand that? - Yes, I understand. Look at me, look at me. You're big now, wipe away the tears. You are my big little man. The others are just children, but you are big now. Kiss me, kiss me. Listen to me. You must never do that again. - You promise? - I won't. - Do you promise? - Mommy... - Have you been drinking? - I had a beer. Stop doing stupid things, okay? Do you want to take a picture? It's completely blinded by the flash. - Promise me you won't laugh. - Okay, I won't. It's just that ... Calm down, calm down. Just say it. - Uh, what? - Do you want to be my best friend? - Do I want to be friends with you? - Yes, you do. I don't know. - You are beautiful. - What's that? - Louder, louder. I can't hear you! - You're beautiful and cool. - That's it? - Uh, yeah, that's it. Then it's your turn. I like the way you are. And if you behave well and don't cause trouble ... - Okay, okay, okay, okay. - Then I'll think about it. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Then let's be friends. I'll let you in on a secret. At home, I like to... Do you? Do you love drinking alcohol at home? - Tell the truth. - No, I don't. Have you tried beer? - We have to tell each other the truth. - I have tasted it. Once. I have also tasted it once. - My mom lets me drink it. - My mother too. - I have drunk several times. - So have I. - Sasha... Do you like it? - Do you like it? - No, I don't... But I love to fight. - Me too. - I want to fight you. - Uh, what? - I want to fight you now. - I don't want to fight you. Stop it! Then I don't want to be friends. You are crazy. I don't want to be friends anymore. If you let go of me, I'll let you go. - Let go of me and I'll let go of you. - No, you won't. Stop it, stop it! That's it. I'm not your best friend. You are brain dead. You're not really smart. - Okay, we make peace. - Peace. Come on in. I'll tell your fortune. Look into the crystal ball. I can see ... Your parents stop drinking. There will be a new consultation - - and you will return home soon. It will happen. Just wait. I'm only telling the truth. - Is anybody there? - Yes, there is. - Who's there? - Shh. Sit down, my girl. Look into the crystal ball. I see your mother dying. That's what I see. Then you are adopted by a foster family. You become their slave. I see ... You're going to have a hard life, my girl. Very hard. You'll get married and get a job. I see that you start drinking a lot. Your children are going to an orphanage. I see your life ending badly. You become homeless. That's it, that's all. That's your future. That's all I see. Assistant! Come out, Alina. - Your mother has forgotten you. - No, she hasn't. - She has forgotten herself. - No, she hasn't. - She has forgotten you and herself. - No, she has not forgotten me. Sometimes I remember her, other times I forget her. She comes to visit me. My mother comes to visit me, yours doesn't. Stop it, stop it! Leave me alone or I'll hit you! When you've worked here long enough - - you start to you start to notice a pattern. A vulnerable child is removed from his family and placed here. In the end, the parents lose lose custody of the child. Years pass. The girl grows up and becomes a mother herself. But when life gets hard, she starts drinking herself. She repeats what she saw in her childhood. One day she returns to us, but this time to visit her children. We meet again and she asks: "Do you remember me?" Yes, I do. If only I couldn't, but I do. Come on, come on, come on. Give it a try! - Kolya, are you crazy? - No, I'm cool! Looks like the monkey has gotten a little aggressive. Try opening the door. - That's it, that's it. - Hurry up, hurry up! We just don't want to get caught. That's a good thing, that the teachers' room is not locked. Oops, the door opened. Don't smoke too fast. - It's great to be outside. - Yeah, it is. Who has the most left? - They are equal in length. - That's awesome. I think soon, the caseworker will be back. Yes, she'll probably send me away from here. Then we'll have one last smoke together. Quickly, quickly, quickly! Come on, come on, come on! Go, go, go! - Where are you going? - Where are you going? Go in there. What's going on? This is the fourth time you've stolen. I've already told you three times, that you need to get your act together. Shutting up won't help. Listen to me. You have to understand - - that in the adult world outside these kinds of mistakes are not forgiven. Theft is a serious crime. You can can go to prison when you are 14 years old. Imprisoned children are locked up in small rooms like this - - and they stay there for years. It's not a joke. You only hurt yourself. - What did you steal this time? - Money. - How much money? - 75 hryvnia. 75 hryvnia. Is that what you mean? Do you want to risk going to jail for stealing some change? - Do you understand what I'm saying? - Yes, I understand. You must change track before it's too late. What long nails! - The girls will be jealous. - No, they won't. - Let's cut them. - Okay, let's do it. Be careful, be careful. - Where do you want to cut them? - Right here. - I heard a policeman passing by. - Yeah, it was nothing. - What do you mean, nothing? - He was just bullshitting. - What did he say? - He warned me. - Next time I'll go to jail. - In jail? I don't care. I'm not afraid of the cops. If it happens, it happens. I am not afraid. Look at me, look at me. Don't play tough. Kolya. You act as if you are worse, than you really are. - This is your second time here. - Yes, it is. You need to pull yourself together. It's like the worse you behave, the better. Who benefits? Me? Remember that your future is your responsibility alone. You have a good head. Hello, hello, hello? - Hello, hello, hello? - Hello, hello, hello. I just want you to know Mommy's not here. Only stepdad Vanya is here, and he's drunk as a skunk. He's completely out of it. - Tell her to call me when she gets here. - She's almost gone. - Just have her call me. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. "All Cops Are Pigs" Was it scary in court? Yes, it was. We came into the court, and then a lady asked me: "Do you want to go back to your mother?" I said: "No." The lawyer showed pictures of my room. There were cockroaches, tattered wallpaper ... I was scared. I thought.., they were going to start yelling at me. I keep it together. I scare all the children! They never fall asleep! We're killing everyone! I'll eat you all up! We'll kill them all! - Let me help you. - You don't have to. I should keep it on. Aren't you afraid? Uh, no. What kind of thread did they use? Thread? Just black thread. Did they sew you up? - They just stitched you up? - Yes, they did. - That's crazy. - It didn't hurt much. Alina! Only a few cases are settled faster than expected. This only happens when the case is particularly serious. In Alina's case we have found a foster family for her. The first time I spoke with my new foster mom - - she asked me if I wanted a new mom. I said: "Yes, yes." We were talking on the phone. I like her very much. She can be my mother. Do you remember how much fun we had we had? I'll never forget it. I cry when you leave. You are my best friend in the whole world. You are such a little fool. Here we are. Come here, kids. All of you! - Why? - Just because. Have we done anything? You're small, so you have to go, dear friends. Sit down, sit down, sit down. Hello, my darling. Many of you are going to an orphanage today. Those who are going, are Artyom, Vlad, Vika and Zhenya. Kyryl and Milana are going to another orphanage. That's it, that's all. No tears. Pack your things so you'll be ready at 9 o'clock. Okay? Okay. Pack your things. Kyryl, Zhenya and Milana have until 10 o'clock. You can refuse that shit, Kyryl. God damn it, Zhenya. It sucks to be you. - What can we do? - Just say no, you idiot. Kolya should stay here with the little kids! Pack all your things. You are not coming back here. You're getting out of this shitty place forever. Kolya is not going anywhere. He needs to pack his shoes. Pack your mug. - The bus is here now. - See you later. - Say goodbye. - Talk to you later. Put the bags in the back. - How are you feeling? - I'm fine. What's that supposed to mean? - Are you bored without them? - A little bit. Were you surprised? Did you cry? Did the boys also cry when they left? - And now what? - I don't know, I don't know. I've told you many times, you need to change. Don't do things, that will cause the police to come looking for you. - You have to be yourself, Kolya ... - I understand. You can do that. If I go to that orphanage - - while Kristina and Zhenya stay here. I can't leave them. - Can I come in? - Please, have a seat. I wanted to talk to you. Listen, dear Sasha. I would like to talk to you. You can't stay here forever. You know that, don't you? - Yes, you can. - This is only temporary. Would you like to living with a foster family? Yes, I could. I would like to have a foster family. Yeah, why? Because your mom doesn't show up. All she does is drink. She doesn't bother me. So you are sure you want to go to a foster family? For today ... Today someone is coming, who wants to say hello to you. Then you can talk a little bit. Afterwards you can think about it and then tell me tomorrow ... ... whether you like her or not, and what you want. - Okay? Uh... - Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's brush your hair. You are a beautiful girl. Let me see, let me see. Very nice. Very nice. - You have a visitor. - Hello, hello, hello, hello. - What's your name? - My name is Sasha. Sasha. That's a nice name. - Can you tell us a little bit about yourself? - Uh, sure, of course. I live not far from here. On Poljovgade. I have a farm and a dog. I love him very much. His name is Bonka. He is small and fat. He's a dachshund. Have you ever seen one before? They are small and long, like a banana, and the front paws point outwards. - She likes flowers. - I have a lot of flowers. I love gardening. You too, right, Sasha? Then you have something in common. If I had a daughter, we could look after it together. But I don't have one. - Do you help the staff here on site? - Yes, I do. - She has many talents. - What a nice girl you are. There was a smile ... You're sweet, Sasha. Are they good teachers you have? - You're not tired of me, are you? - No, I'm not tired of you. Shall we say goodbye to our guest, Sasha? You can tell me tomorrow, what you decide... - and then we'll call Lena, if you want to see her again. - Okay? Uh... - Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - You go and play, my girl. - Bye, sweetie. The scorpion wanted to cross the river, but couldn't swim. So he asked the frog to to help him cross. "No," said the frog. "You'll sting me and I'll drown." "I promise I won't stab you." Just close your eyes. The frog let the scorpion sit on his back and swam across the river. When they were halfway across, the scorpion stung the frog. "Ouch!" screamed the frog. "You promised not to stab me! Now we'll both die!" "Why did you do that?" Scorpio replied: "It's my nature." The end. - What can you learn from that? - That you can't lie. No, no, no, no! That you can't trust people. - Ready? - Yes, I'm ready. Look here, Kristina. What is it that starts with A? - Hi, how are you doing? - Good, good, good, good. - Kolya, I've been looking for you. - Why have you been looking for me? - Because we are leaving today. - Going where? - To Novoajdar orphanage. - I'm not going to do it. - Kolya ... - Yes, yes, yes, yes. Let me explain the situation. Turn around and look at me. - You do know, don't you? - Yes, I do know. I haven't heard from your mother. - Why haven't you? - I don't know why not. I have called several times. She does not answer. - Have you asked her to come? - Yes, I have. Many times. She has not spoken to social services once. It is a state orphanage. When you are in a state orphanage - - your mother has the right to bring you home on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Kolya, believe me. It's a good place. Your mom will get a second chance. She'll get a second chance. She will not lose custody, but this is the last chance. What's the point? She's not coming anyway. - She's not even coming here. - Kolya. Would you rather be in a foster family with your siblings? I don't want that. I just want to go home. But your mom doesn't want to get in touch with us. Do you understand that? Let's get ready.
