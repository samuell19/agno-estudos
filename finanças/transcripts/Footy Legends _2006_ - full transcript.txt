I'm going to be right outside, right here with ya. Remember that try you scored against Bass High, huh? -How good was that? -Yeah, that was all right. Yeah? Or… or that tackle you made against St. Dom's. -That was unreal. -That was good, eh? -You're the man. -I'm the man. You're gonna get this job. -I'll get this job, Lloydy! -Yeah. [girl] Yeah. [announcer speaking indistinctly over PA system] -You can't come with me. -Why not? 'Cause you just can't. [telephone ringing in distance] -So, you a Holden or a Ford man? -Yeah, definitely Holden. We just lost our best sales rep to bloody Ford, so now we've got to get a new one. Yeah, I've just lost my job at the fire extinguisher company that closed down last year. You probably heard about that. I was putting together the canisters and stuff, so I'm very good with mechanics and tools and that. We're looking for a salesman, mate, not a mechanic. Yeah, I can sell cars. A good salesman can sell anything, not just cars. They make us believe in them. Can you do that? Yep, definitely. [interviewer] Sell me this latte. This latte is made from fine glass, eh, imported from Sweden. It's very tough, you know, it won't break, like, no matter what you do. I'll buy one.

We'll do it later. -You'll do it now. -You touch anything, you'll regret it. -[scoffing laughter] Hear that? These girls here who play footy like sheilas want us to regret it. These boys were playing footy? Look more like netball to me. [laughs mockingly] That's funny, huh? Netball. That's funny. At least we've got teeth. [all laughing] Fellas!

But what if he dresses as a spare rib and promotes you somewhere else? He could walk around Yagoona as a spare rib for ya. No, how about at the footy? -What footy? -At the Holden Cup next month. How about we play in the cup, and we'll put your name on our jerseys. You're playing in the cup? -You and your bloody ideas. -We can do this, man. We've just gotta register seven players.

I just want to say that, uh… that I… I believe that most of the… the things that the school's saying about me… uh… stems from the fact that four months ago, I lost my job at the factory when it closed down. I've been looking for work, and, uh… [melancholic music playing] …I'm an excellent brother, Your Honor. I guess, uh… Sometimes I don't… Sometimes I stuff up, but mostly I'm… [sighs] Mostly, I'm an excellent brother. So, uh, I think that you should leave me be the guardian of Anne. Thanks. I object to what they're saying, Your Honor. I'm a very responsible person. I captained my football team for three-and-a-half years. And, uh, we had a 60… [sighs] …63% win record.

By reaching the high school's final, this year's Yagoona High Rugby League team is the best team the school has ever produced. From the baby-faced giant, Donald Lalau, upfront, smashing his way through the opposition…" C'mon, mate. [grunts] "…to the lightning speed of Terry Keenan on the wing, the team has talent across the field. In the centers, Yagoona's flair is on display with the dazzling stepping skills of Walid Chamas. Chamas runs beautifully off the golden boot of Boof Toeye. In defense, Yagoona is rock solid with the tenacity of Shane MacDonald standing firm and strong. In attack, the determination of Robert Lloyd, who plays with so much heart, should carry them out of many a grave. Finally, every winning team needs a strong leader, and in Luc Vu, Yagoona this year have a truly gifted captain who on his day is capable of creating magic. If they can beat Hornsby in the high school's final, these boys will surely become stars of the future." -[Boof] If I ever smoke again… -If I ever smoke again… -[Boof] …my dad, Boof… -…my dad, Boof… -…will kick me with his footy boots… -…will kick me with his footy boots… -…in my nuts. -…in my nuts. -And it will really hurt. -And it will really hurt. -Like this? -[screams] All right.

You're in a porno? -[chuckles] No. Playing football in the Holden Cup. Yeah? [chuckles] I hope this doesn't take too long, 'cause I've got a game on tomorrow. You've got a court hearing on Tuesday. I'm playing in… in this tournament. And if we win, I'll get a job at Lowes selling menswear. -So, everything's gonna be all right. -You've gotta be joking. No. Are you gonna try telling that to a magistrate next week? Because she'll, um, she'll just laugh you out of the room. Anne needs proper care. I care heaps for her. Well, honestly, Luc, she needs an adult. What's that supposed to mean? Well, she needs a responsible guardian. She needs someone who can… [inhales] …someone who can support her. Someone who can pay her school fees, someone who can look after her. [awkward silence] Like, what happens…? How does it work? Okay, well… [clears throat] Um… Initially, Anne would go to a refuge until we found a suitable foster home for her. [Alison] It'd be fine. Um, and we'd try to keep her at her present school, of course. And, um, you could visit her as often as you like. Luc, don't you think you've had long enough to decide? Well, otherwise you're gonna have to stop all this nonsense and go and actually get a job and, um… show us, show the magistrate, that you can look after her. So, we'll be looking after her for you, will we? No. I can't. -[clears throat] -[papers rustling] Can I see Anne now, please? Anne? Hi, Anne. How are you? Bang. Bang.

Over the next two days, Matty Johns and I are gonna bring you all the action live of this exciting new footy championship. And behind us here, we've got the gorgeous new prize for the winner. They call it the dream, Vossy, the Great Australian Dream. Absolutely. It's gonna be a cracker. We've got fans pouring in from as far north as Newcastle. From the west in Dubbo. It would seem supporters from everywhere are making a pilgrimage to see their favorite teams do battle. [Matty] Now, as we speak, the fans are lining up outside the stadium. Look at the Holden Ute, Vossy. It is absolutely gleaming. And over on the promotional hill, the people are excited. You're excited. I'm excited. I can't wait. I love it when you're excited. No more than your wife, though. Stand by, ladies and gents, we're ready for day one of the cup. [vital signs monitor beeping] Excuse me. Um, why isn't she waking up? I've been trying to wake her up. She's fine. The medication just makes her drowsy, that's all. -What the…? -[all laugh] Youse wait and see how fast I go now. Boys, he's gone Brazilian. Lebanese, mate. What are you on about? Where is he? -All right, are you boys Yagoona? -Yes. All right, you know the rules. The winner of today's games plays the winner of tomorrow's games in the final tomorrow afternoon. Comprende? "C"-what? Where's your last player? Ah, he's… He's… And the next match coming up is the boys from the bush, the team from Dubbo, taking on a team, can you believe this, ladies and gents, a team from of all places, Yagoona. You've gotta be kidding me, Vossy. Yagoona? But seriously, one of the great things about rugby league, as long as you can tell the difference between a ball and your backside, you just form a team and get on with it. Bloody beautiful, actually. [Matty] Look at the size of those Dubbo boys. [Vossy] They are vegetarians, my friend. -Come on! -[man] Get 'em! Get 'em! [player shouts indistinctly] [screams] [Matty] And here come the boys from Yagoona. [Vossy] They could all be in a witness protection program. Their heads would get them out of jury duty. Hang on a second. There's only six of them out there. [Vossy on TV] They've only got six players. -[man] Yagoona. Yagoona, -Yagoona. -[all cheering] Yagoona! -Yagoona! Stinky. Stinky. Hey, how're you feeling? Are you all right? Why aren't you at the footy? Footy's dumb anyway, eh? You should go. Are you gonna be all right? Sure? Okay. Stinky. [chuckles] [footsteps receding] [whistle blows] [Vossy] And on the sound of the whistle, we're underway. Strap yourself in. Deep kickoff. This is Boof Toeye. -[screams] Ah! -[thuds and grunts] [Vossy] Gentlemen, defense has cleaned up tackle number one. [players clamoring] -[thuds] -[grunting] [Vossy] And the big hair bear goes down in tackle two. -[thuds] -[grunting] [man] Come on, ref! See that?! [Matty] Come on, referee. You can't let that go. [Vossy] That was just a blatant knee in the head. [grunting] -[continues grunting] -[ref shouts indistinctly] [Vossy] The blokes from the bush are giving it to the lads from Yagoona. [Matty] They're in a bit of trouble early, Yagoona. They're learning what this tournament is all about. [players shouting, grunting] [Vossy] Look out, young man. He's lost the ball. Dubbo in position. Here go the Dingoes. Getting close to the line. Fantastic play. They're gonna score just like that. -What a goal! -[whistle blows] -Bullshit! -Bullshit! -Absolute bullshit! -[screaming] Bullshit! What do we do? [breathing heavily] We've got to try and just keep them out. You know, I feel sorry for the Yagoona boys, don't you, Matty? Mate, I do. I do. But there are advantages to being kicked out early. I mean, they'd be home, showered, feet up in the lounge with a beer watching themselves on TV before they know it. [chuckles] -Even in a live telecast? -Even in a live telecast. You watch it. [Vossy] And Yagoona get set to feed the scrum. And it looks as if this bloke has never fed a scrum before. He's gone on the wrong side. -[Terry] Ref, wait up. -[Lloydy] Luc! [whistle blows] Hang on, break it up. Bring it up, bring it up. -Are you the halfback? -About time, Luc. -Sorry, fellas. -Well, come on. Let's feed this scrum. [man] Okay, boys. Let's go hands. Go, come on! [referee] Okay, come on, guys. Come on. [shouting] Yagoona Schooner! -[thuds] -[grunting] [Vossy] Call an ambulance, Matty. [Matty on TV] Call an ambulance. Here it comes. [Vossy] What a hit, first up. Looks like finally, they've got this… Joseph. [yelling] Joseph! Shut up! For Christ's sake, I think your boy's on telly. Go to sleep, Bob. It's half-time. Dubbo leading by four points to nil, but I reckon Yagoona are very lucky to be only trailing by one try. We're dying. That's bullshit, Terry. My grandad was shot in the war. He had a hole in his stomach, but he kept going. [Terry] So? We're not dying yet, Terry. They scratched me. No one scratches me. You stand up and fight, Walid. Hey, Boof. Remember that guy who kicked you in the nuts at Santos? Remember that guy? Imagine he's out there playing, man. Imagine that. Yeah. I'm going to go out there and beat them like I'm my landlord. That's it. That's it, Shane. Terry. Remember Vince? Vince, he stole your girl man, the only girl who's ever liked you in your entire freaking life. Remember that guy, man? Imagine he's out there playing. Hey, Lloydy, what about Jasmyne? Everyone always said she was too good for you, mate. Mate, you never do nothing, Lloydy. [inspirational music playing] Feel all the shit we've got, guys. All the shit we've got. Let's go out there and do it, guys. [Vossy] Second half is underway, and the kickoff by Yagoona. And Dubbo with the ball, and this is Big Glenn-- [Matty] Whoa. What a hit by Shane. -That is great stuff. -[Vossy] He's got it. Get up! Get up! [Matty] Dubbo spread the ball. [players clamoring] [Matty] He's hanging off like a monkey on a tree, Vossy. [Vossy] Felled with a great charge. Yagoona are lifting. [Matty] Oh, they're lifting, all right. Those half-time Schooners are doing 'em good. [player] Go forward! Come on! [Vossy] And again, the defense lines up. [Matty] Oh, what a tackle. Dubbo's lost the ball. [overlapping shouting, clamor] [both grunting] -Straight out. Straight out. -[Matty] Yagoona, very impressive. [Vossy] You know what, Matt? We might actually have a game on our hands. And another big run. He's gotten through too! [Luc shouting indistinctly] Deeper, deeper. Now, Boof, now! [Matty] Boy oh boy, is this kid having an impact, Vossy. [Vossy] They should spread this. They've got numbers. And Luc does exactly that. Great play. [Luc shouting indistinctly] [Matty] To the bloke in the headgear. Go, son. [Vossy] A wonderful try to Yagoona, "the kid in the headgear." It's four-all… [shouting and cheering] The clock is ticking down. It's all locked up at four-all. -And Yagoona's got a great chance here. -Boof, I want it! [Vossy] Their little halfback steps right, dummies to his left. [indistinct shouting] Great defense from Dubbo. They're not giving up just yet. [grunting] [players continue clamoring] [man] Move! Other way! [Vossy] It goes out the backline. [Matty] Runaround with the big fella. And the little bloke with no hair! -[Matty] He might score here. He does! -[Vossy laughs] [crowd cheering] [Matty] What a try, Vossy! [commentary continues, indistinct] [thuds] [referee] Yagoona wins, game over. Who would have thought? Yagoona into the second round. Amazing stuff, you little beauty. [Vossy] If you're not enjoying this, you're very hard to please. [indistinct shouting] -Taxi! -Taxi! [Matty] Yes, Vossy, they're breezing through this match. [Vossy] Luc to Donald. He's gonna get there. And he does. Try! Go Schooners! [Vossy] Racing down the sideline. Throws it to Shane. And Shane scores! -[whistle blows] -[cheering intensifies] [upbeat music playing] [Vossy] Heartwarming stuff. He runs across field. Throws it over to Walid. And they'll score here. Try! These guys are on fire! Well, let's go down to our sideline commentator, Mario Fenech. Mario, what just happened is so very rare. Yes, mate. Rare as a virgin rabbit. But who will they play in the final? Will it be the snags from Drummoyne, the surfies from Cronulla, or, of course, will it be Billy Major, who sets out to prove himself with Double Bay? Yeah, thanks, Muzza. Can you believe it? Yagoona into the final. -Unbelievable. -Cinderella story. Fairy-tale stuff. [Luc] Billy Major. Luc Vu. -Hi. -Congratulations. -You did real good out there. -Thanks. Just to let you know, I'm putting together a first-grade team for next season. Yeah, I read about that in the paper. Honestly, mate, I'm impressed by what I saw from you. Well done. Thanks. [footsteps receding] -[Lloydy] I found one. I bloody got one. -Where? Oh. It's dead. It's just… just a shell. [Shane] On your right, bro! Walid! [overlapping shouting, chatter] [indistinct chatter continues] [cheerful music playing] [indistinct chatter continues] [indistinct shouting, chatter] [indistinct clamoring continues] [feel-good music playing] [Terry] Good catch! [indistinct shouting] [cheering] [Luc] We're in the final, man. -[girl in car] Come on, hurry up. -Yeah, I'll just be a sec. [slams shut] [Lloydy] Hi. Rob. I just want to tell you before you leave. Yes? We made it into the final of the Holden Cup tomorrow. Good on you. I'm really happy for you. Do you really have to go? Yeah, this is the ass-end of the world, remember? [chuckles] Australia's the ass end. So, I guess this is the ass end of the ass end. [both chuckle] The next time I see you, you probably will have made it. I'll see ya. [door opens] Jas… I think you're beautiful. And I've had this, like… crush on you for years. Ever since my tennis ball went over the back fence and you gave it back to me. I'll miss you. -[door closes] -[engine cranking] [engine cranking] [engine cranking] [engine clicks] [kisses] Good luck tomorrow. [engine starts] [door opens, closes] [car revving away] [sighs deeply] What are you doing here? I came to see Anne, whose life was put in real danger, thanks to you. Yeah, that was an accident, but she's all right now, so… You know that there is no way I can stand up in front of a magistrate on Tuesday and tell him that you are fit to look after anyone. I've asked that Anne be placed into care as soon as she leaves here. [awkward silence] -You haven't really given me a chance. -I think you've had too many already. Wait… -Okay, now. -Brittany. Brittany's gone to sleep for winter. Do you think she'll ever wake up? I hope so. I wish she wasn't gone. Yeah, I miss her too. When are they going to take me away? -Who's gonna take you away? -Alison came before. If anyone takes you anywhere, I'm gonna come with you. All right? Yeah? We'll go visit Grandad after you're better, yeah? You know, Grandad didn't fight in the war. He just made it up. Who told you that? Bob. And Grandad. You gonna be all right here tonight? Yeah, I'll watch you play on the TV tomorrow. Yeah. Okay. [speaking Vietnamese] "Your mother, your mother." Bullshit! [breathing heavily] [spiritual music playing] [birds chirping] -Hi, Anne. -What's happening? Could you please tell me why I should be fighting for your brother on Tuesday? 'Cause I've got nothing to go on. I've just got a blank page. Can you give me one reason? Do you wanna see something? [knock on door] -Morning, Luc. -Shit. Hope it's not too early for you, mate. -Oh, this is my assistant. -G'day, mate. -Do you guys wanna come in? -I won't take long, champ. I got a chance to, uh, check out your games on video last night. Good stuff. You've got real potential, mate. Thanks. Yeah, it's a good bunch of guys. I wanna offer you a contract to be part of the Bay squad next season, hey? It'd be a full-time job, of course. You'd be playing with us, training with us. -A full-time job? -Yeah. -You'll pay me to play footy? -Of course. That's great. That's brilliant. Listen, mate, uh, our halfback just pulled out at the last minute. We need you to start today in the cup. Yep. -Oh, today? -Yep. Yeah, I'll have to play with Yagoona today. Mate, you'd be perfect for us. You'll slip right in. I can't just swap teams. It happens all the time. Tuqiri, Kimmorley, David Beckham. Can't I play with Yagoona for you? We need you to play for us. Or, uh… Just think about it. [tense music playing] What is it? They're gonna take her, Lloyds, if we don't win today. Mate, by this afternoon, we could be modeling undies for Lowes. [Lloyd chuckles] [indistinct chatter] Come here, mate. [grunts] [indistinct chatter] [man] Hey, boys! Make room. [indistinct chatter] [melancholic music playing] -[Vossy] How about this? -[Terry] Is the sauce free? Billy Major's got some of the former greats back together on hand for Double Bay. [scoffs] [Matty] And what a superb line-up, Vossy. Bradley Clyde, the ultimate New South Wales warrior. Gary Larson, one of the mightiest Maroons. Cliffy Lyons, former Manly superstar. And Roddy Wishart, the man carved from steel. [Vossy] And don't forget Brett Kenny, one of the greatest playmakers the game has ever seen. And to round out for seven, he's also got Phil Harrington and Rob Bayless, the halfback from Dubbo who played yesterday. -[Matty] Can he really do that? -[Vossy] Yes, he can. A team can have any combination of players as long as no one… [commentary continues indistinctly] It's an extraordinary line-up. From a coach who is desperate to prove himself to his new club, and they are paying him a monster. Now, Double Bay are playing Summerhill first up. Look, I wouldn't wanna be in Summerhill's shoes right now. I really wouldn't. 'Cause, Vossy, I think we all know who's gonna face Yagoona in the final this afternoon. Clyde? Larson? Kenny? Jesus Christ. [Terry whimpering] We can't go out there. We can't. -You should have known this. -[Lloydy] How, Terry? They only announced their team this morning. Yeah, stop whinging, Terry. Yeah, Terry. You're such a geek. [Terry sobbing] [Terry sobbing] This is all your fault. You stuffed us up. You stuffed up, Terry. You used to be smart. Now, you're pushing trolleys. -Leave it, mate. -[Luc] Oh, big Lloydy, eh? You get a trial with the Eels and you don't even show up. What's gonna happen to you in a war? You bastard. We've got a game on today. Yeah, that we're gonna lose. 'Cause all our lives, we lose everything. [Terry sniffles] We can't, guys. In the past ten years, man, I've done it all. I've done coke, ease, gear, and trust me, nothing… nothing comes close to playing football, man. Yeah, bro. For the last two weeks, my boy looks up to me. I can see it in his eyes. Guys… I just want to play football. [announcer on TV] By this afternoon, only two will remain. Two teams who will battle it out for the precious prize. The Holden Ute, the Great Australian Dream. Watch as Yagoona take on the Sunday champions live in the final of the Holden Cup. In the beginning, there were 32. From the west, they rode. From the east, they sailed. But against all odds, it's Yagoona who have gone through. Can the fairy tale continue for the Schooners, or will their story end here? Tune in live at 4:00 p.m. for the final of the Holden Cup. [inspirational music playing] Where are you going? [inspirational music continues playing] [Bob] What are you doing, mate? [music fades] [sighs] ["Shine" playing] Just say I'm your daughter.

Lyons fields the ball for Double Bay. Back for Clyde. Up comes Shane out of the defense. He went for a shoulder charge and missed him. Now Larson with the ball for Double Bay. Another missed tackle. This is terrible stuff from the Schooners. And Double Bay with Wishart over halfway, little Terry is chasing. And it's four-nil after about two seconds. Yagoona Schooners, it's already four-nil. If there's a God in Yagoona, you'd better throw on a jersey and run out there now. Grandad! [Joseph laughs] Hey, darling. [exclaims] Ah! [Vossy] And Boof kicks off. They're going for the short kick. [Matty] Terry's got it back from him. Yagoona's in with a chance, Vossy. -Terry's hammered by Wishart. -[Vossy] Crunch. [Matty] Raise the ball, Boof looks for support. -[Vossy] But there's no one with him. -[man] Help him. Help him! [Matty] He picks him up like a little toy teddy bear. Boof's tackled on the 40. [Vossy] Well, in goes the dummy half. What are we doing? Kick it. Everyone, try. [Vossy] Walid to big Donald, and he kicks it. Come on, Yagoona, you're all right. Just don't kick it to Kenny! [Vossy] He's kicked it straight to Brett Kenny. -[all exclaiming] Aw! -[discontented groaning] [Vossy] Kenny steps around Luc, goes past Terry, dummies past another. Kenny's only got one to beat. I got him! -[Matty] Oh, no. Tragic. -[whistle blows] [Vossy] Eight-nil, my friend. Shut the gate. If the Yagoona side don't start playing footy soon, this score-line is gonna be embarrassing. We've gotta do something. We gotta. [Lloydy] Luc. -Everybody in. For every tackle. -That's it. [Luc] Yeah, all right. [breathing heavily] Everyone in. We tackle till we die. [Vossy] Double Bay still making a lot of ground. They've given it to Clyde. [Lloydy] Go, Yagoona. [grunting] [Matty] They're all jumping in. The whole lot of them. Look at this. Four, five, six. [grunting] Everyone in! Everyone in! Yagoona! [Vossy] Great tackle, Yagoona. We can tackle. We can tackle. [overlapping shouting and clamor] [crowd cheering, whistling] [Matty] Larson charges through, and he's pulled down just short of the line. [Vossy] Great play. Both sides, great play. And Wishart's gonna get caught. Great cover defense by Terry. He looks hurt. [Matty] Come on, son, get up. [Vossy] Lyons, he looks certain to score. Wonderful scrambling by the hooker, Boof! They've saved another try! They hold him up! Great effort! But they're starting to feel it now. The Schooners, they're looking buggered. [Matty] Kenny to Harrington. Will he go all the way? -Great tackles. -[Vossy] Way to go. Larson chargers. Surely, they've gotta score. -And held up again! -[ref blows whistle] It's beautiful. Bellissimo. -They'll battle it out forever. -[whistle blows] [Matty] And that's half-time in our sensational final. Double Bay lead eight-nil. Down the paddock over here. [everybody breathing heavily] [Lloydy] What are you doing? What the hell are you doing? -Let me go, Lloyd. -Where're you going? They're gonna take her away, mate. I got offered a job this morning. I have to take it. [Boof] What's he doing? [spiritual music playing] [commentary continues indistinctly in the background] [spiritual music continues playing] [Anne] Hey, Stinky Head. Stinky! Stinky head! [giggles] [Anne] Hey, where are you going? Come on, guys. I thought you said it was fun. [soft, hopeful music playing] Stacks on. Stacks on. [inspirational music playing] [Luc] Hey! Hey! Ha-ha! [all clamoring, laughing] [whistle blows] [Vossy] We are underway for the second half. The Double Bay Dolphins leading the Schooners by eight points to nil. What can they come up with in the second half? Boof is in a dummy half. A long for Luc. Now he gets it a long for Donald. Lovely little runaround. Where'd they get that set play from? Now, there's a man inside. It's Lloydy. Lloydy's through the gap. The Schooners are into the clear for the first time in the match. [crowd member] Lloyd, you've got this! [Vossy] The crowd is urging him on. [Matty] Wishart goes! [Vossy] But cover defense is coming across. It's Rob Wishart. Oh no! A head clash. But Lloydy's hung onto the ball. It's a try. It is eight points to four, but Lloydy is down. Sir. Stretcher. [Luc] Lloydy, that was awesome, man. So bloody wanted to do that. -You're the king, mate. -Hey, mate. [breathing heavily] Stuff the army. I've got my own. [Terry] We can't go on. We haven't got enough players to fill the park. And… And they're just too awesome. They're legends. Yeah, but they've never played together before. And we have. We've played in parks, rivers… Played everywhere, man. Since we were small. Real small. Honestly, guys. I can't get jobs. I can't do math. Can't spell for shit. If there's anything we can do for anybody, guys, it's this. [supporters cheering] Yagoona Schooner! Yagoona Schooner! [chanting] Yagoona Schooner!
