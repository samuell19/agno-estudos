Miss Havisham? We're home. This place is great. It's much bigger than our flat in London. It's strange. It's not how I remember it. Yeah, but that's to be expected though, right? It's been years. I think it's nice that it's staying in the family. We'll fix it up, paint some walls. This is what we wanted. Welcome home. Welcome home. Okay, that's the last of the bags. Family, hearth, straw and stone. Start anew. A new start, Robert. One more, then we're done. Hey, Robert. Yeah? I was thinking we could head into town. Okay. Down in a minute. I know that can't be Maia Eden standing at the end of my bar. In the flesh. Well, that is impossible. 'Cause I heard she up and took herself to London, found some British guy and settled down. Oh. Well, that would be me. Some British guy. Judy, this is Robert, my husband. It is so nice to meet you, Robert. Likewise, Judy. "Likewise." Oh, I like that. It's fancy. We could use some fancying up around here. Well, I'll try my best, Judy. Sorry about your pa. Thank you. Tell you what. Let's do this. Shots? It's the good stuff. To Edgar. To Edgar. To Edgar. Fucking hell. What is in that? The secret recipe. If I tell you, I'd have to kill you, but you definitely need another one. Oh, no, you don't have to. Oh, he does. Yeah. I got this. I can handle it. No, get off. What did you say these are, anyway? They, uh... They're "chillins"? Chitlins. Oh. Like 'em? Chitlins are good. What are they made out of, anyway? They feel like, uh... like chicken? Oh, uh, pig intestines. You fucking... Oh, my God. Are you serious? Babe, gross. I'm gross? You're making me eat pig intestines. Hey, guys. These are from Larry and Martha over there in the back. Huh. They just wanted to say, "Welcome home." I am so wasted. Oh, God, it's gonna be rude if I don't. This'll be the last one. Just pour it out. No, it's fine. This'll be the last one. Okay. That's definitely the last one. Maia! The prodigal daughter has returned. Pastor Ellis. Now, would you please just start calling me Joseph? You're a little too long-grown for that "Pastor Ellis" horseshit, don't you think? Of course. Yeah. Who is this hungry new addition to the flock? This is my husband Robert. Pig intestines. Judy gave him a little too much special moonshine. As well she should. Special drink for a special guest. Well, Robert, it is well past time that Maia brought you around to meet everybody. A hearty welcome to Briar Glen. We are very, very glad that you are here with us. Know what? Everybody! Everybody, let me have your attention. It is with great pleasure that, after many years, finally... ...the daughter of the great Edgar Cartwell Eden has returned to us. So I want everybody to lift their glasses up. Cheers. To our own Maia and Robert. Cheers! Long live the... You okay? You're home. Hey, hey, hey. You okay? Hey. It was a bad dream, huh? You all right? It's okay. God. What happened last night? Um, you got wasted and fell off your chair. I had to bring you home, remember? So embarrassing. It's okay. I took care of you. Please. Stop. You have to stop doing this. Doing what? Freezing me out. It's not gonna bring her back. You blame me, don't you? No. No, of course not. No, I could never blame you. I know how much having a baby means to you. But it's like the doctor said, miscarriages happen. Especially the first time around. Doesn't mean we have to give up, does it? What if it happens again? I know you're scared. I'm scared too. In the last... ...year, I've lost our baby... now my dad. I don't know if I can handle another loss. But I believe in us. Don't you? Yes. Yes, of course I do. I believe in us more than fucking anything. I love you. I love you. What? Hmm. Yeah, I guess I can see a resemblance. A resemblance? Yeah. Maia, it looks exactly like me. Yeah, well, maybe if you, uh, wore those contacts I bought you. Oh, God. See? Hmm. Yeah, not sold. I'm gonna need, like, to see a scowl. There you go. I'm glad you find it funny. - All right, fine, yeah. - It does look... It sort of looks like you, yeah. Thank you. Hmm. What do you think it means? I don't think it means anything. Mmm. People go to museums and see themselves in paintings all the time. This wasn't in a museum. It was in your attic. Mmm. Yeah, well, my dad traveled a lot for work. He collected art. It was one of his passions, so I guess this could've come from anywhere really. What does it say? Says, "The Visitor Accepts." Well, what exactly is he accepting? I don't know. His drink? Well, he's a visitor, so maybe, uh, he's accepting an invitation to visit. You're not still taking that medication, are you? For your anxiety? No. You sure? Yeah. No, I-I threw that down the toilet months ago. The doctor said it's only for emergencies... Please, Maia, come on. Not again. I'm off it. I'm done. Okay. Well, here's your receipt. All right. Okay. It looks great. Thank you. Here you go. You have a blessed day, you hear? Thank you, Kathy. Hi. You're... Robert Burrows. Uh, Maia Eden's husband. We should talk, Robert. Will that be all? Um, just today's paper, if you have it. Sure. Let me grab one for you. All righty, then. Here you go. Great. Thank you. That's awesome. Um, how much do I owe you? Oh, please. Your money's no good here. Art is a lie that makes us realize the truth. You have a blessed day, now. Okay. Yeah, so it's two boxes that haven't been delivered. Two boxes from London? Yeah. Yeah. One of them is a, uh... just a bunch of personal items, and then in the other one, there's a suit. And you still have not received them? Right. What's the tracking number? Yeah, no. No, no, no. We-we, uh, we never received a tracking number. Can I transfer you to our shipping department? Okay. Yeah, sure, I can wait. This is Mike from shipping. Hello. Hello. Hi. Yes. Yeah. So this is... Two boxes missing? Yeah. Yeah. This is probably the fourth person I've spoken to about this. Sorry about that. Yeah, we haven't received two boxes. Okay. We never got a tracking number either. A couple of people have said that, on your end, it says it's been delivered. Here. I don't know. Your dad's suit? Well, you already stole his overalls. Yeah, but to his memorial? Well, he wasn't wearing it when he died. Go on. We are here today to remember the fortuitous life of Edgar Cartwell Eden. Like most of us, Edgar's roots in this town go... go back generations. All the way back to the early days when this was just a patch of dirt on a road to someplace else. With Edgar's help and the help of generations of Edens that came before him, Briar Glen was allowed to-to become the safe haven for our community that it is today. Y'all know how much Edgar loved this town with all of his heart. He gave as much of himself as he could possibly afford. He carried the weight of his family's legacy with honor and dignity. And make no mistake, we are less because of his devastating absence. But there is hope. And that has come to us in the form of Edgar's daughter Maia and her new husband, Robert Burrows. Robert, why don't you stand up, let everybody get a look at you? Everybody, give him some encouragement. Robert! Come on, Robert! Robert, I know you're new to these parts, but I speak for everyone when I say you already feel like one of us. Thank you. All right. Nobody minds, I think I'll read from the big book again. I like the words. And I'll keep it short. It's getting a mite warm in here, I know. Hey. Gonna head out to the shops. You want anything? Um, no, not that I can think of. I'll call you if I do. Okay. Can I help you? Oh. Hi. I'm actually looking for the other lady that works here. I'm sorry. Kathy's not here right now. Do you know when she'll be back? Can I just say, on a personal note, how lovely it is to have you here in Briar Glen? The town has been infinitely brighter since you arrived. I'd be happy to help you find anything you might need. Uh... Hello? Hello? "The Visitor Watches It Burn." That's not for sale. Oh, um... I'm sorry. I, uh... I was just hoping you might be able to give me some more information about it. Anything would be really helpful. It was here when I bought the store. And judging by your accent, I bet your schools didn't teach you the history of this place. So I'll give you the short version. There was a whole lot of bad going on back then. And I'm not the kind of person who hides from evil. No, sir, I... No. It can't be. I know. Believe me, I was shocked, too, when I found it. I found another one just like it in my wife's family's house. Look, I took a picture. How did you find me? It was a woman named Kathy. She works in a store in, uh, Briar Glen. She gave me this note with your address on it. You listen to me, and you listen good. You think you want answers. You're wrong. The truth is your worst enemy. What you need is to run back to London as fast as your legs can carry you. Do you understand me? Yeah. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come here. Now go and don't come back. I'm sorry. I wanted to check... Don't you ever come back! I'm leaving, I'm leaving. Sorry. Go! Hey. Where were you? I was worried. What's that doing up there? What, we can't laugh about this yet? Come on. You know, I just found another one. What? Another painting. Of him. This time, he was, um... he was, like, a Confederate soldier. There was this crazy old lady there, and she was, like... she was, like, clawing at me. She said I had to move back to London. What... How did she know I was from London? Your accent? No. No, no, no, no, no. It was... it was definitely more than that. It felt like she... I felt like she-she knew me. The way she was looking at me. I feel like everyone knows me. Robert, okay, listen. I put this painting up because I thought it would be a funny, you know, inside joke between the two of us. I mean, you don't actually think that's you in the paintings? Robert. I-I don't know. It... Oh, my God. It looks like me. This has got to stop, Robert. We're gonna make this place our home. Do you even want to be here? Yes. Yes, I do. Are you sure? Yes, of course. Of course. Yes. Just think the stress is getting to me. The bad dreams, the move. You're right. I just need to, like, focus on you. And us and this house we're in. Know what? I'm gonna go finish up in here. No. Welcome home, boy. It spills over into direct attack, and the workers tear the chosen queen to pieces. Nothing can go to waste, even the royal carcass. Workers carry hungry larvae over to feast on the dead queen, including many that must have been her own offspring. You scared me. Sorry, I didn't mean to. What? You serious? Yeah. I'm gonna be here for you. I promise. I love you. I love you. And he doth deceive them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those miracles which he hath power to do. And the beast was taken and... And the beast was taken and with him the prophet who worked miracles before him. These both were cast into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. Now, our Maia, she was always first through the door at Sunday school and last to leave. I had to kick her out on, well... Oh... more than one occasion. Don't give me that face. You know it's true, you little rascal. Ah, watch it. It's hot. Thank you. To your strong, healthy, miracle baby boy. Cheers. Cheers. Well, that's not gonna do. Drink up. You know, Robert, I've been meaning to ask you something. Are you a true believer? Honestly, I'm not. Would you give me your hands? Come on. Come on, now. Give me your hands. You will. You will be. When you see for yourself, you won't be able to deny. The, um... the christening's important to Maia. So it's important to me too. Thank you. Well, of course. Of course. And I don't want you to have any fears about that. We do a simple ceremony. None of that drowning the newborn around here. That's a relief. Listen, I'm just gonna go and use the loo. Okay. Bye. Oh, he means the bathroom. Oh. Down the hall to the right. Thought I was gonna have to send out a search party for you. Sorry. I-I took a wrong turn, and I-I saw this painting. It's... Do you think it... It's you. Yeah. You should see the look on your face. I had you there for a minute, didn't I? No, no. This here is none other than the great Alistair Edgar. Man that saved this town. See, when our ancestors first settled this place, it was... it was dire. Famine, disease. The loss of human life, it was... it was unthinkable. To say it plainly, this place was going to hell in a handbag. That is, until Alistair found a way to pull it up out of the mud with his own fair hands. Now, this portrait was a gift from Alistair to the town. But if you ask me, real gift was Alistair himself. You can't imagine how inspiring it is for me to wake up every morning, first thing I see is that man's face. It's the gift that keeps on giving. I've seen other paintings just like this. I swear it's the same guy in every single one. He's... He's always referred to as "The Visitor." I mean, could it be that it's Alistair in every one? Genesis 1:27. "God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him." What does that mean? Right. Bible verses aren't your thing. How about this? There can never be too much of a good thing. I would just take it as a sign. You are where you are meant to be. And you know what? I think maybe it's time for you to get that young Maia home. She needs her rest. Sure. Yeah, you're right. Um, look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to come into your... Stop right there. You are welcome to go anywhere you want to, Robert. We're just so glad that you are back. I still cannot believe you went in his bedroom. He had one of those paintings. Again with the paintings. He said his name was Alistair Edgar. Robert, please, you promised... He said he was the founder of your town. Alistair Edgar? Alistair Edgar was born in the 1700s. So unless you have a time machine that I'm not aware of, I don't know what to tell you, Robert. I know I'm starting to sound crazy, but this is really, really beginning to... Oh, God. Hey. Oh. Hey. Where you going? I'm just off to, uh, a doctor's appointment. Oh. Oh, I didn't-didn't realize. No, it's not, uh, anything important. It's just a quick checkup. So I'm fine. Oh. You sure? Yeah. Just wanted to do this alone, if that's okay. Okay. Bye. Hello. Mr. Burrows, I presume? Yeah, speaking. You're alone, aren't you? Yeah, I'm alone. Who is this? Let that be your first lesson. In the town of Briar Glen, you, sir, are never alone. Okay, thanks for that. I'm gonna hang up. No. Wait. What is it? I want you to come to the window on the far east side of your house. Look outside. I'm really not in the mood, okay? I assure you I am deadly serious. Just ask our mutual acquaintance, The Visitor. My, my. Will you look at that? It really is uncanny, isn't it? Maxwell Braun. Purveyor of fine arts and antiquities. Please get in before anyone sees us. Yeah, I... I don't think I'm gonna do that. Thanks. You want answers, don't you? It's now or never. I call this "The Visitor series." This is the first one that caught my eye. I was shopping a collection in Germany, mostly pieces from the '30s and '40s, around the time of the Second World War. It was completely buried amongst the morass. But something about it called to me. If I'm honest, I think it was 'cause I thought you were easy on the eyes. Or he was. Whatever. You get my point. Anyway... ...I purchased it to add to my collection, then after some time, it faded from memory. That is, until a few years later when I came across this. All right, this is... this is really starting to creep me out now. These are just the tip of the iceberg. Congo during Leopold's brutal reign. Cambodian genocide during the 1970s. It became an obsession. Mining collections, libraries, museums, estate sales. Uncovering hundreds of photos, all of them featuring this same man. And each of them corresponding to moments in human history we wish we could forget. Is his name Alistair? I spent years trying to ascertain his identity. To no avail. Nearly drove me mad. Then one frustrating drunken night, I stumbled across an online forum dedicated to rare and forgotten contemporary art. That's where I met Margaret Delacroix. From the antique store. Yeah. She tumbled down this rabbit hole years before me. Along with a group of like-minded individuals, she made significant strides towards discovering the insidious truth behind this man's identity. And for that, she paid the ultimate price. She died? So who is he? He is both you and not you, Robert. What does that even mean? It means you're still in control of your own destiny. You can decide. But just know that decision will have graver repercussions than you could ever possibly fathom. Can you just please just stop talking to me in riddles? What decision? Just tell me, honestly and clearly, what the fuck is going on? This is not your home, Robert. These people are not your friends. And if you're being honest with yourself, I think you know that already. Their gain is not only your loss, but the rest of the world's loss as well. But you can still leave. Go back to London, or better yet, find somewhere even more remote where nobody can possibly find you. By all means, be happy. Use this money to create and live a comfortable life. Just live it anonymously. What about my wife? We're expecting a son. I can't just leave. A boy. This is even more urgent than I thought. What has my son got to do with this? You, your son and every male heir in your bloodline from here until eternity will be affected by the choice you make, Robert. Go, and be the good man you were raised to be. Or stay and end up in one of these photos. Stay and become The Visitor. Robert? Robert. Robert! Been thinking a lot recently. What with the baby coming, everything that's going on with these paintings... Again with the paintings. I think we should move back to London. Excuse me? Something is off about this place, Maia. Maybe you don't see it because you grew up here. Maybe you blocked it out. But I don't feel safe. Why? Because you bear a passing resemblance to a man in a painting? Yes. Actually, that. Since we got here, there have been real consequences. People have died. Who? Margaret Delacroix, the lady from the art shop. And what about Kathy? One minute, she's here, the next minute, she's gone. I'm sure Kathy is fine. Poof. And no one seems to care! What if we're next? Do you know how crazy this sounds, Robert? Why? Because I want to raise my child in a place that feels safe? No, what's crazy is that after we've taken all of our stuff halfway across the world, now you're pulling this shit? I'm not pulling anything. I met a guy today, said his name was Maxwell Braun. Maxwell Braun? That's what this is about? He's famously insane! He had information. He showed me photos. What about me? What about what I want? This is my home, Robert. And for once in my life, it's starting to feel like my home. I'm not gonna give that up over some fucking delusion. This is not a fucking delusion. Okay? You can go to London. You'll be going alone. Family, hearth, straw and stone. Start anew. Robert, it's Maxwell. I received your message. I'm here at our meeting place as you requested, but I can't stay here much longer. You don't know what these people are capable of. Please hurry. Where have you been? Mr. Braun? Maia! Maia! Maia? Maia? He never loved me. Maia? Who is this? He wanted a son. He needed a son. I wanted to tell you for so long. But Pastor Ellis convinced me you weren't ready. Not ready for what? Maia, who the fuck is this? Edgar Cartwell Eden. Our father. Look, I know it's a lot to take in, Robert. But it is time that you hear the truth. You were kidnapped, Robert. They smuggled you to London, found you a family far away from us. They tried to break the cycle. Braun. Margaret. Amongst others. But they got what they deserved. So you killed them? Oh, no, sweetheart. You did. Those aren't nightmares you've been having, are they, Robert? That's not me. That never happened. Robert, you have to stop fighting this. Deep down, you know what you are. Oh, no, please. Oh, no. No, please. You don't have to do this. No, please. Please. Please. Please. Please. You're a light-bearer, Robert. A vessel for a greater power. Just like every firstborn male in our family since Alistair sacrificed his bloodline for the people of this town. No. No, this isn't real. This is all in my messed-up, stupid fucking head. This is your privilege. Don't you understand? I was sent out into the world as a little girl to find you and bring you home. Took me years! I have sacrificed so much for this family! Now it's your turn. I don't know what these people have been telling you or how they brainwashed you, but you need to listen to me. I'm Robert. You're Maia. We're married. We were living together in London, and then your father... Our father. Our father! Your father... Your father passed away, and now we're here in your childhood home, and... You're-you're pregnant. Jesus fucking Christ. You're pregnant? Our son... is our future. He was always part of the plan. In London, we were supposed to have a little girl! I did my part. What is that supposed to mean? You needed a boy. You fuck... Oh, fuck. Oh, what is happening to me? You stopped taking your medication. The herbs are beginning to work. Hey, Robert. It's okay. They're helping you to transition. We can finally be the family we always wanted. Be who you were always meant to be. Oh, my God, I've so been duped. Do they sell pecan pie here? Uh, no, I don't... I don't think so. Yeah. I, uh... I asked this man outside my hotel where in this city I could get a slice of pecan pie. He gave me this address. Yeah, I definitely think he was pulling your leg. I think you might be right there. Damn. Your first time in London? That obvious? Yeah, there's not a lot of pecan pie spots. No kidding. I'm Robert, by the way. Robert. I'm Maia. Start anew! ...when he takes his throne. Family, hearth, straw and stone! Start anew when he takes his throne! Family, hearth... Brothers and sisters, we are saved. The Eden bloodline will finally be restored. We humbly present our bodies as a living sacrifice to he who came to us in our time of need and offered us power, purpose and hope. We invoke you to awaken this vessel to prepare Lucian, he of purest Eden blood, to fulfill his destiny as the final prophecy has foretold. ...as he takes his throne. Family, hearth, straw and stone. It is the last hour, the hour when darkness reigns! Family, hearth, straw and stone! He prepares the vessel! Family, hearth, straw and stone... He makes his way into this world! Family, hearth, straw and stone. He comes! Start anew when he takes his throne. Welcome home, boy. Find him, Maia. Welcome, baby Lucian, bringer of light, lord of fire and blood. We charge you now, Robert, to raise him well, that on your death, he will become you and complete our dark lord's work on this Earth. Take the throne. Rise up now, baby Lucian. The last in your line. The chosen one. The long wait is over. Your time is upon us. Take the throne. Take the throne. Take the throne. Take the throne. Take the throne. Take the throne. Take the throne. Take the throne. Take the throne. Take the throne. Will you accept this honor, Robert? I'm off. I'll see you in a few days. Brothers and sisters, today is a new dawn. It is a time of destruction, a time of renewal. Now The Visitor will make his dwelling place among us. And from our humble hearth, he will cast his reign like a shadow over all the world. Blood, tears will spill forth from his mouth. They will bow before him, one and all. Engulfed in his unholy fire, the world will kneel. And we, brothers and sisters, we shall be at his right hand as he assumes his throne. Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert! For now, we lay in wait, as he goes forth to plant the seeds for what is to come. A new kingdom. A new beginning. A new Eden.
