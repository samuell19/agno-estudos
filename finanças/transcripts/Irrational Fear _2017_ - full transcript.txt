Julie, you have to start returning my calls. This is the fifth time I've tried to get ahold of you in the last week. Dennis called, and he said you haven't been attending therapy lately. Have you been taking your pills? Call back as soon as you can. Just do it. Do it. ♪ I'm inside you ♪ ♪ I can't see you ♪ ♪ I can't touch you, no, no, uh-huh ♪ ♪ But I can feel your energy ♪ ♪ From all across the galaxy ♪ - Come in. ♪ Electrons moving through me ♪ ♪ Making me singularity ♪ - Taylor, it's so good to see you. Have a seat. So, have you had a chance to think everything over? - Uh, yeah um, I just don't think it's gonna help, you know. - Come on, it'll be like, it'll be like the good old days, when we spent every summer at Camp Rolling Hills. - Seems like a lifetime ago. It was only what, 15 years ago? - A lot's changed since then. We've both changed a lot too. - I know we haven't been as close as we used to be, but that's part of the reason I want you to come. I wanna make up for it. I know that I've been buried in my books the past few years, trying to get ready for my boards. - Yeah, so you can find out what's wrong with people like me. - Taylor, look, let me talk to you as a friend. This would be really good for you. Trust me, I have been in your shoes before. Dr. Sanders knows what he's doing. - We're not wired the same, Zach. You can be anybody that you want. - That's easy for you to say. I get nervous walking in a crowded hallway. - Fear of physical contact is very common, but you can't let it control you. Everyone has irrational fears, but at the end of the day that's all they are, fears. They're just ideas. They can't hurt you. Dr. Sanders is more than just some teacher trying to help. He helped me get over my fears, and he can help you too. Come with us. - I'm not brave like you, Zach, I-- - Taylor. See. There's nothing to be afraid of. Will you do this? - I'll come. - Great. We leave first thing tomorrow morning. Your mom will be okay with you being gone for the weekend? - She won't even notice I'm gone. Hey Zach. - Yeah. What fear did Dr. Sanders help you overcome? - Oh it's, it's not important, it's silly. - No, tell me, please. - Ghosts. Stupid, right? - No, it's not. Thanks, Zach. Goddammit. Thanks, Dr. Sanders. - Don't mention it, you don't want that one getting ruined. - Oh no, no, I uh, I love your class, it's cool. - I understand you spoke with Zach. Yeah. - And? - He didn't say much, just mentioned this weekend and the whole therapy experience, or whatever. - I think it would do you some good, Taylor. You've been in my class the last two semesters. You seem to be afraid of putting yourself out there. - Yeah, yeah well who wants to talk about their feelings, and that crap? - I'll see what I can do. What do you mean, you'll see what you can do? - You mentioned in class you plan on attending grad school when you're done with your Bachelor's degree. I could write you one hell of a recommendation letter. - You could or you would? - We will just have to see how this weekend goes. - God, I was afraid you were gonna say that. Okay, I'm in. - Perfect, perfect, perfect. Pick you up tomorrow as eight sharp. This is going to be one weekend you'll never forget. - Those are always the worst kind. Shit. - Wow. What are you doing up so early? Hey, Taylor. - Taylor, Rich said hi, why don't you show some respect? - Hi. - There you go, good. - Why are you all packed up? - I'm going out of town for the weekend. Really? - Yeah, I didn't think you'd care. - Well, text me when you're on your way back. Let's go make some breakfast. - Yeah. Taylor, Taylor. I really like what you're doing to your hair. - Don't touch me! - What are you doing? - I told you to never touch me! - Let go, it hurts! - Taylor what're you doing? - It hurts, let me go. - I told him to never touch me! - What're you doing? - You've heard me say it 50 times! It's a compliment you stupid ass bitch. - Taylor, sometimes in life people are gonna touch you. You better break outta this stupid little phase you're in, otherwise-- Well hello, Mrs. Parker. Who are you? - I'm Dr. Sanders, your daughter's professor. I wanted to thank you for allowing her to come to our retreat. We really think we can help her overcome this little phase you seem to be having trouble handling. Who's this guy? Wow, really? Well, maybe you should just take her home then, because if you bring her back the same way, I'll put her somewhere where they lock the rooms. - She should be locked up, she's crazy. Look what she did, really? - Noted, well it was a pleasure meeting you, Mrs. Parker, but we must be off. We're running late and have several other patients to pick up. Good day, come on Taylor. - I think he's one of them. - Honey are you okay? - Yeah. - I'm so sorry, she's crazy, she's crazy. - These crazies ever give you any trouble? - They're not crazies, Mr. Littleton. There are levels of wellness, as you know. This group trusts the process. - Trusts the process. - Cameron. That's my name, we all have one, what's yours? - Sorry, Taylor, just, it's my phone, I literally just had it. Check your right hand. So what're you here for? Same thing as you, I'd imagine. - You don't like it when people touch you? - What? - Oh um, that's my fear then, I guess. - Well damn, I thought I had it bad. Nah um, I love being touched so, okay well, I don't mean that sexually I just, though I guess I kinda do. Sorry, I sound like an idiot. - No um, you're fine. - Ah, to answer your question though, my phobia is choking. Do you know that over 3,000 deaths happen a year from obstructions of the airway? - No. - Yeah, so um, most of the time it happens when you're all alone and you could be sitting at home watching television and eating popcorn and wham, you know, average response time for an ambulance, if you can even call one, is about five to 10 minutes, so by the time they get there, you're blue. - Wow um, yeah, I didn't know that. - Pretty scary, right? - Yeah. I wanted to thank each and every one of you for being a part of this therapy experiment. I know it won't be easy, and some of you are further along on your journeys than others. But, I can promise you that I will do everything I possibly can to help you address your fear head on. - How much longer till we get to this hell hole? What, what did I say, it was a simple question, geez. - No, it's a very valid question, Helen. 10, 15 minutes tops, right, Mr. Littleton? - Yeah, we should be there-- - We're lookin' at? - In about 15 minutes. - Yeah, you should each be very proud of yourselves for taking this first step on the road to recovery. I know it won't be easy, it never is. But, you're all on the right path and that's half the journey. There you go, kiddies. - Thanks, man. - Yeah. There he is. Kelly, you made it. Oh, my gosh, Nate. - Hi, Doc, how are you, buddy? It's so good to see you. - Good to see you too. - I'm good, I'm good. Good, it's good to see you too. Is uh Jake, uh-- Yeah, yeah, he's um he just want to uh, - I'll be back to pick you up whenever I feel like it. - It's a nice day, he just doesn't wanna come out. So, I figure that, - Um-hm, Monday morning right? I think he'll be right behind us, so, - Uh yeah sure, whatever. - Thanks. - Aren't you gonna help me portion out some we got a lot better, sure. - Yeah, don't mention it, I'm used to driving you crazies around. - Huh. - You mean he just doesn't wanna come out and have to wait for you. He's gonna help me, as we talked about, So, I wanna get this weekend off on the right foot, obviously, so-- - Right, right, how you start it is very, very important. You set the tone, set the expectation and he will then know what to expect. Remember, your anxiety feeds his anxiety. You're doing the right thing already, you're asking for help-- - Yeah, I felt my own anxiety - That's good. Building up, so I figured I'd wait till you got here to kinda, you know. - Um-hm, yeah. We will take care of it. - All right, now it's cool. - We're staying here? Christ, this is worse than rehab. - This is beautiful, Dr. Sanders, where's the lake? - It is just right down that hill, but let's all get unloaded first and then I'll give you the tour. Awesome. - Hey, Doc, you never said anything about a lake. - Don't worry, Helen, you don't have to get in until you're ready. - Nah, I'm not gonna get in. - Okay, that's fine, but why don't we discuss this later in the weekend? - Whatever, Doc, it's not happening. - I'll show you guys inside. Watch out where you step. There's potholes. - Okay. - What're you looking at? - That's 90 calories per swig. Jake come on, let's go, Jake. I don't wanna be here. Well, what's wrong, Jake? It's not safe, nothing here is safe. Don't be silly Jake, it's just the woods. - Is that a fly? - Yes, there's flies in the woods Jake, come on, we talked about this. - A fly can carry millions of bacteria on their feet alone. What if one of them lands on me? - Jake listen, that's exactly why we're here, to help you with this, all right. - Nate, Nate, um if you don't mind, I'd like to-- Sure, yeah. - Jake, my good friend, this is going to be something you'll never forget. Now I promise you, that if you take that first step, right now, and open this door, that you'll be on the road to a whole new outlook in life. - There are animals out there. Animals carry germs, bacteria, diseases, infestations. - Yes, yes, of course Jake, they do. But there's nothing to be afraid of, do you understand? We're here to help you, but we can't do it for you. You just have to trust me, trust all of us. You just need to take that first step. - I just don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. - That makes two of us, kid. - Helen, um, room accommodations are first come, first serve. Nate, would you mind if I spoke with Jake alone? - Yeah, yeah, do that, do your thing, Doc, I'll see you up at the ranch. - All right, we'll be right, we'll both be in. - Okay, yeah, - Right, Jake? - Take your time. Am I good here, Doc? - Yeah, everything's good. All right, I'll see you Monday. - Absolutely, oh and remember, don't come for us until I send for you. Alright, I'll wait for your message. - Yes. Jake, this is the beginning of something huge, okay? There's a lot of candy and all the things that are not good for you but we're gonna have. But you know, you're gonna have to put in the work, alright? You do the work and then there'll be rewards for everybody. I mean, you know how it goes, Jake. - I don't think I really have a fear, I mean I just don't wanna be ugly. I mean, you understand, you're pretty. I mean yeah, we all have our different reasons for why we're here this weekend and-- - Fuck, this is like a homeless compound. - Okay um so, the rest of the bedrooms are gonna be upstairs. Feel free to check them out and grab a bed. Taylor, you wanna come with me, I'll show you around. - Hey Zach, I'm gonna go check out the lake. Okay. - You have any kids? Definitely not. - Okay. - So, I think I'm gonna take the top bunk. You're more than welcome to take the bottom bunk, or check out any of the other rooms if you want. - I'm easy, I'll sleep wherever. - Well then why don't you take the bottom bunk? - Okay. - God forbid I get stuck in the same room as Helen. She's a little crazy. Is that your professional opinion? I'm not a doctor, yet. Look at this. He's good. Yeah, I'm lucky to have him as a mentor. - I bet. - I'm really glad you decided to come. It means a lot to me. Thanks, Zach, it means a lot to me too. - Well, crisis averted. I think I'm gonna go help them get the rest of the bags inside. - Okay. - Jesus Christ, this is not happening. - Not a big fan of water, huh? - Not in the slightest. - Huh, I love swimming. I can swim a mile in 22 minutes flat. - Wow, that's really impressive. - No, I'm serious, fastest on the team. - Just don't choke on the water. - Hey um, if you don't mind, I'll take a swig of that. - You're not afraid of my germs like the kid, are you? - No, no, no, that's uh, that's not my thing. - What is it then, you need the moral support or something? - Or something like that. So look who's decided to stick around. Hey, there he is. - Hey, dad, I have nothing to be afraid of. - That's right, son. - And neither do you, we're in this together, right? - Yeah, you're right. - So glad to hear it, yeah. Um, Zach, why don't you get the grill started. I imagine you all must be pretty hungry, right? - Well, what on the menu? - Burgers, brats, we can grill up some potatoes, anything you'd like. - Any greens, salads? - Of course, Kelly, we have some pre-made salads with your name on them. - I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse. - Alright. - Me too, Jake, me too. Why don't you all just take an hour to relax, have some lunch. Our first session is gonna begin at 9:00 p.m. at the gazebo. We're all here for one purpose, to find our true potential without irrational fears holding us back. I know that if you give Zach and I honesty, perseverance, and a little bit of courage, you will all feel so happy to see what you can overcome. Welcome to camp, everyone! Alright, let's get out of here. Thanks again, man. - Oh, just breathe, Cameron. ♪ I know it's just a stupid fear ♪ ♪ I shouldn't be, shouldn't be, shouldn't be so scared ♪ ♪ I lose my mind when I can't see what's there ♪ ♪ I shouldn't be, shouldn't be so scared, it's true ♪ ♪ My mind takes over and I just don't know what to do ♪ ♪ I know, I just don't know what to do ♪ ♪ I know, I just don't know what to do ♪ ♪ I know, I just don't know what to do ♪ Uh, what's that? - Oh, I'm recording these sessions for my documentary series. - I know you said you were recording earlier, but I didn't know I was gonna be on camera. - If there's anything at all you guys don't want in the documentary, I won't put it on there. Trust me, you have my word. Our first group session. Don't look so paranoid guys, I promise, this isn't going to kill you. This is going to be a life-changing event. And, after this weekend, you'll never be the same again. Is that a threat or a promise? - Helen, please, I can only help you if you truly wanna be helped. We've gone over this many times. - Taylor, can I get you to move a little bit closer to Helen? I need to get you in the frame. Thanks. - I know that some of you have already had the chance to get to chat a bit, but let's go around the circle and introduce ourselves for those of us who haven't had the chance. Just basic communication here, folks. Remember, you don't have to share anything you don't feel comfortable sharing. Anyone care to get us started? Zach, why don't you get us started? - Okay, I'm Zach Mitchell. I'm 24 and I'm a graduate student at Windsor College. I'm specializing in psychiatry and human responses to alternative medicines. Kind of runs in my family and I'd like to carry on the tradition. - I'd also like to add that Zach is one of my most promising students. In fact, he's probably the brightest pupil that I've ever had. He's a very special student. Taylor, why don't you go, and we will go clockwise from you, and then the fun will really begin. - Okay um, I'm Taylor Parker, I am one of Dr. Sanders' students at Windsor. Zach and I grew up together. He lived down the street from me when we were kids. Third time in college, but I'm really determined to finish this time. Life just got in the way. I guess I'm afraid of people touching me. - Oh god, sweetie, wait until you try sex. Helen, that's enough. In fact it's your turn. - Fuck it, I'm Helen. I like a little ass play and double rainbows and if you try and get me to go in that lake, I will cut you. - Helen, fear of water is actually very common. A lot of people-- - Please kid, you sound like a pussy. - It's fine, you don't have to do anything you don't want to. It's good to set boundaries, and we're all here for each other. - Wait, how'd he sound like a pussy? He wasn't even meowing. Very good, my man. - Nice one, buddy. - What about you, Jake? - Me, uh, I... - Me and Jake, we both got our things. - I was afraid of germs, but now I'm not anymore. Thanks, Dr. Sanders. - What about you, cutie? - Uh, um, I guess I kind of always had a fear of dentists. I used to get these really severe toothaches as a kid. They were like really bad. And sometimes they would last for days. I haven't had one in years, but I still dream about them. It makes it worse. - Sometimes dreams, even daydreaming, can be a powerful illusion. That's all it is, an illusion. Just because it exists in the mind doesn't mean that it can actually cause pain-- - Sometimes it um, I mean it hurts so bad. It's bizarre, Doc. I've had a half a mind to just pull them out and wear dentures. - It's good to get this out in the open, isn't it? Cameron, your turn. - Hi, my name is Cameron, I'm 18, a high school senior. I'm graduating in a few months. I've got sports scholarships to most school in pretty much any state, which is kinda cool. I'm thinking about maybe baseball at Riverside U or football at Washington, I don't know, you know, whatever, you know. - Oh god. - Excuse me? - You're a good-looking sports star that will literally have his entire life handed to him on a silver platter. You know, I remember guys like you from high school. Hated them then, hated them now. - And judgmental much, huh? Actually he's like a really nice guy. Oh god, that's what they all say. - Guys, this is supposed to be a bonding experience, not an all-out attack. Cameron is a bright kid. Maybe if you actually got to know him, you could see that. You know, I don't think it's fair to judge him or anyone else here. We all have our demons. Something the matter, Zach? - Uh yeah, I keep getting a hissing interference from Kelly's spot. Oh, heap of fun over there, I'm surprised she didn't break the damn camera. Helen, that's enough. - Yeah well, at least I don't have to be drunk to look at myself in the mirror. - At least I don't have to look in the mirror 800 times to think it's gonna get better. - Okay Helen, let me just stop-- - Fuck you, you're just jealous. - Okay, can we watch the language in this. Jealous of what, your busted-ass weave and caked on make-up from the dollar store? - Okay, this is aggressive anger, Kelly-- - You are such a bitch. - Kelly, kelly. - Hey, this is no, no place to fight about this. - Maybe I am a bitch, but at least-- - Helen, come on. - I don't have an eating disorder. - Your tone is aggressive. - Fuck you! - Okay, okay, everyone, everyone just sit. Nate, Nate let her go. Please, please have a seat. Zach, I'll help you figure out that camera. Everyone else just take a break. It seems that for some reason, tensions are running high. Go. Helen, if you could stay back for just a second. Thank you, thank you. - Man, everything's fine now, that was weird. - I'm glad it's working now. I hope it didn't slow you down. - No, it's all good, Doc. - I'm gonna have a chat with our problem child. Would you mind checking on Kelly to see how she's doing? - Yeah, of course. - Helen, a word. What you said to Kelly was wildly inappropriate. - Please, she can take it. - We're all here to help cope with our fears. Did you realize that Kelly has extreme sensitivity in regards to her personal appearance? - Who doesn't? - Just try to be a little more respectful of the other people here, okay? This negative attitude, and overall resentment isn't going to help anyone. Trust me, I know. My point is that we're all here to get better, yourself included. - Listen, Doc, I'm only here because the court ordered it. I can handle my fears just fine. It's not my fault that the others can't. - Hey, Zach. - Hey. - Is she gone? - Yeah, she just took off. Don't worry about it though. Dr. Sanders'll handle it. You okay? - Yeah. I'm good. - I'm sorry, that was, that was unprofessional. - No, no, it, it's okay. - After this weekend. Okay, let's get inside. - Mm, smells good. How did you sleep, Jake? - Not too bad. Anyone else awake? - I don't think so, at least not when I was up. - Uh. You know, Jake, there's gonna come a time where to won't have your hand sanitizer. - I'm sorry, bad habit. - It's okay. Here you go. - Hi, Jake, morning. - Uh, how are the pancakes, Jake? Taylor, how many pancakes would you like? - Uh, no thanks, I'm not really a morning eater. It just kinda drags me down. - Uh well, would you at least like some coffee? I just brewed a fresh pot. Oh yeah, definitely. Sometimes I feel like it's the only thing that keeps me alive. Here you go. - Oh, thank you. - Who's that? That's actually a very good question, Jake. Zach, where did you go? I didn't know anyone else left. - I was shooting some footage for my film. Yeah, the hills out here are beautiful. And there's nothing better than free production value. - Yeah, just don't forget about us when you become a big celebrity. - Only if you can be my muse. - Yep. Dr. Sanders, what time is our first session? Any reason in particular? - No, just thought I'd take a little walk, explore. You know, I think Zach had the right idea. - That'll be fine, Taylor, just try to be back no later than 10. Today is going to be a very big day. - Cool, yeah, hour tops, promise. - Have fun. Thanks, you too. - Taylor. - Yeah? - I like what you've done with your hair. - Thanks, Zach. - Pancake? - Yes, please. Pass me your plate. - Jake, help me, help, help, help, Jake! Jake! Morning, everybody. - Here you go, Nate. - Thanks. Hey, what'd I tell you about too much syrup? - I'm sorry. It's fine, Nate. - That stuff'll rot out his teeth. - Dad, I like it. - Hey listen, I said the stuff's not good for you, alright Jake, don't eat it, alright, it'll eat enamel right off your teeth, just knock it off. - Nate, Nate please. Everyone is here for the same reasons, including you. - You're um, you're right. I'm sorry, Doc. Just be sure to brush your teeth when you're done alright? - You know I will, dad. - Smells like pancakes. - Want some? - Nah, I'm good. I had my shake already. - I think I'm gonna go try and get some more footage, maybe catch up with Taylor. Doc, did you ever hear back from Kelly? - No, but I plan on checking in with her later. Remember, Kelly's strong. I have no doubt that she'll decide to return to treatment when she's ready. - Is someone making me a plate or something or what? - Taylor! Okay, here we are in beautiful Crivitz, Wisconsin. Dr. Sanders's lake house. I'm so excited to be here at his very first therapy session weekend. Dr. Sanders has already made some success with our youngest patient, Jake, who has an excessive aversion to germs coupled with obsessive thoughts and mild autism. Even though some of the other members of the group haven't quite warmed up to his methods of teaching, I am extremely confident that today, we'll see some major breakthroughs. Taylor? Taylor, if that's you, let's head back to the first session. Taylor? Taylor? Taylor! Taylor! - Cameron, don't clean the pan now. We're about to begin session. Everyone, have a seat. I think we need to address last night. Oh, Zach, did you find Taylor? - Uh, no. Dr. Sanders, I need to talk to you. - What's wrong with you, kid? You look like you saw a ghost. - Ghosts aren't real, Helen. Zach, where's Taylor? - I need to talk to you. - What's going on? - Yeah, is she okay? - Privately. - Everyone, take five. We'll be right back. What's going on, Zach? - I found this. - What's this? - I think it's Taylor's. I found it out there on the trail. Something fucking happened to her. - Is this hair? - Are you fucking drunk? Of course, it's hair! - Zach! That's enough. What else did you find? - Nothing. This is it. Doc, I think we need to find Taylor and we need to get the hell out of here. - That's impossible, Zach. The van won't be back until Monday afternoon. - What the hell are we gonna do? - Simple, we tell everyone the truth. - Taylor! - Everyone, may I have your attention please? Taylor's missing. - Wait, what do you mean she's missing? - She probably high-tailed it out of here like that Skelly. - Show them, Zach. Are you fucking serious? Is she okay? Dad? - Whoa, hold on, so what, is she like, was she attacked? I mean, Doc, are there like bears out here or something? What? - Not that I'm aware of. - Well then, where's the rest of her? - I don't know what happened to Taylor. But one thing's for sure, we need to find her immediately. I'm asking all of you to help me. - Yeah, yeah, I'm in. - I'm not going anywhere. - What's that supposed to mean? - It means I'm staying right here. She's a big girl. - Alright, that's fine, alright? That's fine. I'll come, too, let's go. Dad, I don't want you to go. - Jake, listen, everything will be fine, okay? Just, you can stay here if you like. Helen, you watch him, alright? I'll be right back, alright? I have a choice? - Do you think she's okay? - I don't know, kid. I don't know. - It was right here. - I don't see any signs of bear. - How do you know about signs of bear? - I'm an Eagle Scout, dude. - This doesn't make any sense. - Taylor! - Taylor! - Taylor! - Zach, tell me exactly what you heard when you came out here. - This buzzing sound, and then there was this whispering. I don't know how to describe it. - That doesn't sound like a bear. - Taylor! - I'm such an idiot. I was filming, and I have it on tape. Thoughts and mild autism. Even though some of the other members of the group haven't quite warmed up to his methods of teaching, I'm extremely confident that today, we'll see some major breakthroughs. - What was that? Taylor? - Taylor! - Taylor, can you hear us? - Shit. Excuse me, kid. What do you want? I told you never to call me. - Hey, kitty. What are you doing here? Hey, kitty. Where are you? Kitty, kitty. Where did you go? Get off me! Get off me! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off me! Get it off me! Get it off me! Get it off me! Get it off! Get it off me! Get it off me! Get it off me! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off me! Get it off me! - Jake! Jake! - Bye. - Where's Jake? Did you hear that? - Hear what? - Here. Jake, Jake, please. Jake, Jake, Jake. Buddy, open up. - I'm sure everything's fine. I have a key! - Jake, buddy, open up. Jake, buddy. Open up the fucking door! Are you sure he's even in there? - I'm sorry, you know. I got it, I got it. - What is this? If this is a joke, it isn't funny, alright? I spent a lot of time and money on this weekend. I'd like to get some answers. - What the fuck is this? This isn't even reality. This is a - There has to be a valid explanation for all of this. This isn't the first time I've heard of something like this happening. - What do you mean this isn't the first time? - Nothing, I only meant that some people respond to therapy and treatment differently. - Listen, I don't consider putting my son's life on the line as a response to therapy, alright? Where the hell is he? Somewhere, he's a good boy, listen, I know, I know he isn't safe, so wherever he is, this isn't some type of fucking game. I just wanna find my son and get the hell out of here. - Oh, my God, Taylor. - Where's Helen? - Jesus, what the hell happened here? - Did you see or hear anything, Helen? Because I heard Jake screaming and I ran here as fast as I could. I ran here, the door's locked. It was locked from the inside. He's nowhere to be found, Jake. And this, alright this, you, you were the last one to see him, so what the fuck is going on? - Don't look at me. I got a call and went outside. I saw you guys running, and I didn't know what was happening. Is he okay? - I don't fucking know, Helen! I don't fucking know. I have no fucking clue. - I'm sorry. Please leave a message after the tone. - Jake, buddy. It's Dad. You need to call me as soon as you get this, alright? I heard a scream and I can't find you. I'm getting really worried. Please, buddy, be okay. Please be okay. - Zach, Cameron, why don't you two go continue searching for Jake? I'm sure it's nothing. There has to be a logical explanation for all of this. People don't just vanish. - Then what about Taylor? - Zach, please. Like I said, we will figure this out. I promise that everything is going to be just fine. You have my word on this. - Dude, Zach, wait up. Something isn't right, man. - Yeah. - What the fuck was that stuff? Where's Jake? Where's Taylor? - I don't know, but we're gonna find them, okay? - Look, I know this sounds crazy, but I think they're dead, man. You know, what the fuck was that stuff? - Don't say that, okay? - There was blood in there. I have a really bad feeling about this. - Come on, boys. He's gotta be around here somewhere. - Dr. Sanders, this is bad. This is really bad, guys. - Okay. - What matters now is that we find the boy. Come on! - Guys, wait up! - Want some coffee? - No. I can't eat anything. - Here. Don't worry. I'm sure he's fine. - How can you say that, huh? He's not the type just to wander off, I know. - Kids do it all the time. - That's fucking bullshit, Helen! I know my son, alright? For God's sake, he won't touch fucking dirt. Why the fuck would he be off on his own outside? Answer me that, will you? Fuck, you idiot! He'll show up, I'm sure of it. - I just can't stand here and do nothing like this. What are you doing? - I'm calling the police. He's been gone for five minutes. - 911, what is the location of your emergency? - Hello, hello, police? Yeah, yeah, I need police over here at the Hello? - Hello? - Are you there? - Help! Help, the fucking Sanders's home. - I don't fucking know - What do you fucking know, - the address, okay? - Helen? What do you fucking, hello? Hello? Goddammit! Fuck! - Relax. - Fuck you, Helen. Don't tell me to fucking relax. I'll put your head through this fucking table. My son is missing, you have no fucking clue. I mean, no fucking clue for 30 seconds. - No clue what you're going through? Is that what you just said to me? Yeah, that's what I fucking said to you. - Yeah, that's fucking bullshit. Your son's been gone for five minutes. Mine's been gone for five years. - I didn't know. It's not something I have to bring up in casual conversation. - Well, what happened? - We were at the beach in California. I knew about the current warnings, but Michael wanted to go so badly, so I took him. Told him not to go too deep. He was only 12 but he was such a good swimmer. Plus, there were lots of other people swimming so I wasn't too worried. After maybe 20 minutes or so out there, he got pulled in by a rip tide or something, sucked completely under. I only saw him pop up once screaming. I tried to save him. I ran out and swim into the water, and that's when the current got me, too. I was sucked out in the middle of the ocean in a matter of seconds. I thought I was going to die. I went under and right when I was about to breathe in the water, someone grabbed me and pulled me out. Some jet skiers at the right place at the right time. For me, anyways. They never found Michael. Not even a trace. - I had no idea. I'm so sorry. - Don't be. Shit happens. - Water. What? - Helen, the water. What if Jake fell in the lake? Fuck, Jake! Jake! - Wait! Jake! Guys, guys, hold up. - It's Kelly's car. Wait, be careful. - Dude, it's more of that black sludge. - She must be around here somewhere. Kelly! - I thought she left. - She didn't make it far. - Dr. Sanders, what do we do? - Come on, we've gotta go back and tell the others what we found. - Jake! Jake! - Nate! - Jake! Jake! - Dad, help! - Jake, hold on, buddy, I'm coming. Help me. Jake! Nate! - Jake! - Nate! - Help, help, someone. Help! - Nate! - What the hell is she doing? Shit, shit. - Helen! - Zach, Zach, wait, wait. - Help me, somebody! - She's gonna drown. Cameron, hurry! Helen, take the raft. Helen, take the raft. - Save him. Save him. Save him, Cameron. Bring him in, Cameron. Safely, safely, safely. Oh, goodness. - He's still breathing, so, let's get him inside. - Yeah. - You went in after him. - I guess I did. - I didn't think you had it in you. - Well, I'm full of surprises, Doc. Let's find your patients and get the fuck out of here. - We just need to hold off until morning. The van will be back then, and everything will be just fine. - Everything will be just fine? I found a chunk of Taylor's hair in the woods. We now have three patients missing. There's this gross black sludge that keeps showing up everywhere, and now Nate is lying unconscious in bed. I don't see how anything could be less fine. Why don't we just go and try to find help? I mean, we have Nate's car. We can go and try to see if somebody's around. I couldn't find his keys. I already tried looking. They must've got lost in the lake. - Well, what about Kelly's car? Obviously staying here isn't doing us any good. - You're right, Cameron. Yes, why don't the two of us go and see if we can get Kelly's car started? Zach and Helen, stay here with Nate. Hopefully there's a logical explanation for all of this. Keep an eye on the door in case someone returns when we're gone. Are you coming, Cameron? - Are you gonna be okay? - I'll be alright. - Deep breaths, Cameron. You've come a long ways. You all have. We'll get help, find the others, and by Monday morning, this will all appear to be a bad dream. Don't let all of this damage all the progress you've made. - Progress? Yeah, I feel worse than ever. This obviously isn't going to end well. - You're strong. You've always been strong. I mean, where's that happy-go-lucky teen that I've been treating for the past year? He's in there. - Yeah, I'll be a lot happier when we find everyone and I'm home, okay? This weekend was a mistake and I wish I'd never come. - I'm trying here, Cameron. I've got nothing but the best intentions. I thought this would be a good learning experience for each of you. There are others out there just like you. - What do you mean when you said others have responded differently to therapy? You said you'd seen this before. - Some people are stronger than others, but others succumb to their own personal demons. - Zach, how long have you been working with the Doc? - I took his abnormal psych class, and I've been his TA the past few semesters. Why? - I feel like Dr. Sanders isn't telling us everything. - Funny you should say that. - What's that? - I found it in the black sludge out there in the garage. - What is it? - I don't know, but I know it's not Jake's regular medication. - What does that mean? - I'm not sure, but I think Dr. Sanders could be drugging Jake. - I just don't know what's going on. - If I do, Cameron, if I tell you, we just need to stay focused, okay? I know we've had some setbacks, but that doesn't mean that this is all for nothing. - Yeah, setbacks. That's to say the least. I mean, that kid is dead for sure, and Taylor's hair, the shit in Kelly's car. I demand to know - No, no, - what's going on. - That's enough, Cameron. You want to get better, don't you? - I'm not sure anymore. - If you want to get better, then just do as I say, do you understand? - Come on, we're gonna find some answers. - Sorry, Cameron. I'm sorry that I have to do it this way, and I know that with your condition, this might be difficult. But here. - What are those? - Take them. - No, I could choke on those. What are they? - Cameron, it's going to be fine. Take the pills. Take the pills. Take the pills, Cameron. Take the pills, Cameron. Take the, Take them! - Oh, shit. Doc, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I really didn't mean to - If he catches us in his room, he'll be pissed. We've gotta make this quick. - Let's do this. Where do we start? Wait, what's this? - More of that black ooze. - Oh, shit. Whoa. This isn't trusting. Wait, I thought we were the first group to come up here. - Doesn't look like it. What is this? Coke or something? - No, not the right color. Looks like he's smashing up those pills. - Why would he do that? Dad. Dad. - Jake. Is that you? Dad, I'm here. - Jake. Jake. Is that you? Jake? Come here. Come here. - Jake? What are you doing here? - Dad, I made you some pudding. - I can't eat that. That'll rot my teeth. - It's fine, dad. Try it. Here, try it. - I thought you were gone forever. I did, I thought you were gone forever. - Try it. It's really good. - I thought you were Jake, I thought you were dead. I thought you were gone forever. I did. I thought you were gone forever. I'm right here, dad. - Yeah. I thought you were gone forever. I thought you were gone forever, Jake. You're right here, buddy. - What's this? Looks like old case files or something. That's another one. - These are his old patients? Zach, how well do you know this guy? - I don't even know anymore. - Have you taken any of those drugs? - No. I mean, I don't think so. - Look, this guy's mental. We've gotta warn the others. - Shit. Cameron. - Fuck. We've gotta find Cameron. Kelly's car's right up the road. - He's alive. He's okay. - You found him. - You found Jake? - I found Jake. I found him, alright. Yeah, he's okay. He's okay. - Jesus Christ, Nate, - Oh! - What are you doing? - I'm cured. Oh, yeah, I'm cured. I'm cured, okay, don't be afraid. It's okay. - Just stop. And Jake's alive. Nate, what the fuck is going on? - Jesus, calm down, okay? Put that down. No, no, no, no, stop! No, no! God! - Fuck. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - I'm not afraid anymore. - My apologies, Cameron. I don't have these smashed up for you. But, now is the perfect time as ever to get over your fear of choking. Yeah, yes. We're gonna help you. We're gonna help you get over your fear - Get off me. - Of choking. - Get the fuck off me. Get off me. Take the pills. Cameron, that's a good boy. Down the hatch. Down the hatch. It's going to be fine now. Come on. Let's get back to the cabin. Now, why would you go and do a thing like that? I'm trying to help you, Cameron. - Fuck you, you're insane. - No, I'm not. - What is this shit, anyway? - I'm the doctor, Cameron. You're the patient. Now, if you aren't going to take your medicine, then I have no choice but to terminate this relationship. Take the pills. - Zach, Helen! - Don't do that, Cameron. - You've got a fucking knife? What are you gonna do, stab me? - Last chance, Cameron. Take the pills. I want you to get better. Take the pills, please! I want you to get - Zach! Zach, over here! - Come back, come back here, Cameron. Come back. I'll be good. I'll be good. Where are you, Cam? It's just me. It's Dr. Sanders. You still have drugs. I don't like it when we're fighting. Remember, it's about trust. How am I supposed to trust you if you run away every time there's a problem? Communication, Cameron. Effective communication. - Zach, Zach! Zach! It's Dr. Sanders. - What are you doing? - I'm looking for a weapon. Don't wanna end up like Nate, do you? Here, take this. - Really? I got something better than this. - Whoa. - What? You think I'm gonna come out in the middle of the woods with a bunch of strangers and not be prepared? Please, I got this for the trip. Let's go find this bitch, because he's got some explaining to do. - What is the meaning of this? - Where's Cameron? - Take everything out of your pockets. We found the files, the pictures, everything. - You really shouldn't be snooping through my stuff. You could go to prison for a very long time, both of you. Not exactly the start to a promising new career, is it, Zach? - I'm pretty a doctor's oath to first do no harm takes precedence. - I only wanted to help. - Yeah, you wanna help? Then tell us, where's Cameron? - Oh, Cameron, I don't know. I thought he was with, he's not with you? Is he okay? He wandered off in the woods while we were looking for help. Are you fucking kidding me? Have you seen your fucking shirt? - You just pulled out a knife covered in blood. Explain that. - No, I almost had it right this time. With each trial group, there are fewer side effects. - Side effects? Side effects? I don't consider the death of nearly an entire group of patients a side effect. You were my hero. Now I can't even look at you. You're disgusting. - You know you'll never get away with this, right? This is the end of the line. The police are on their way. You can explain everything to them. - I'm sorry. I couldn't save them. And I can't save you either. - How many have there been? - At first, the drugs were working. Their fears were subsiding. But then after a couple of months, it wasn't enough. Their fears had returned stronger than ever. I upped their dosage, and I changed the formula, only slightly, but it was too late. - You killed them. You drugged them. - Zach, the drugs only turned the fear to a substance, something your body can fight and eventually pass. The Agramon. - The sludge. - A mixture of science and ancient magic. If you believe, of course. I had no idea that fear was so powerful that it could overtake people entirely and disintegrate their bones - Oh, cut the shit, Sanders. I'm not listening to another word out of - Helen, Helen, don't. - It will kill you. It's going to kill all of us. - What do you mean? Don't listen to him, Zach. - You're both already infected with it. There's no going back now. - You're fucking insane. - Yeah, I haven't taken any of your shit, Doc. Are you sure about that, Helen? - Zach, Zach, what's wrong? Whatever you're doing to him, stop it now. - You're dead, you're dead. - Zach, there's nobody there. - You're wrong, though. Fear is very real. Overcome it, Zach. Fear. - Zach. I'm not afraid anymore. Touch me, Zach. Kiss me, Zach. I've always wanted you to kiss me. Touch me, Zach. Kiss me. Touch me! - Zach, Zach, Zach. Fight it. Listen to me. Look at me. You've gotta fight it. Come on. Are you okay? - We have to stop him. - I'm on it. - Oh. - Son of a bitch. Where'd he go? - Uh, oh. Uh, uh, uh. Cute, Helen. Very cute. - Bastard. - Don't call me names. You know it didn't have to be this way, Helen. You were the only one to overcome your fear. You know? Even that won't be enough. Please, please, please, please. There is nothing to be afraid of. - Please. - Zach! You should've stuck with me, Zach. We made a great team. We could've solved this - Hey, fuck off! - Together. - What's your fear? - Ow. Ow. You hurt me. You hurt me. I'm afraid to die. - You okay? - Fuck no. I could use a drink. - But sometimes it feels like it's just overwhelming, like whenever I see a spider, I just go into a full panic. - Trust me, I understand how you feel, Simon. I've had my fears, too, but I've overcome them with hard work and patience and acknowledging that that's all they are. Fears. Nothing more. Nothing that can actually harm you. - I think I understand. Thank you, Dr. Mitchell. - Well, it looks like our time is up, but you're making great progress. Yeah, same time next week? Yeah, sounds great. Thanks for everything. - Yeah. Helen. Wow, what a surprise. - Well, I had to see how you were doing now that you've got your own practice. I mean, if I were you, I would've left this whole thing behind to become a plumber or something. - Well, it's been my dream for so long, and after what we've been through, I don't think I've ever felt more prepared. - That's great. Congrats. - I know it's been a whirlwind these past few months, but I gotta ask, what do you think happened out there? - Those people are dead, Zach. - I'm sorry. Hey, shit happens. This wasn't your fault. - Yeah, I guess not. It's just all so insane, like, kind of a horror story or something. I just don't understand why he did it. - You just said it. Insane. The guy was mental, nothing more to it. - He was on to something, though. I've been looking through his notes and his journals, and as much as I hate to say it, he was right about a few things. - Do you think they'll ever find him? He's dead. You saw him just like I did. - Yeah, I guess you're right. I'd just feel a hell of a lot better if they dragged that body out of the water. - That muck's deep. Probably sunk 20 feet down. But they'll find him eventually. - I'm not getting my hopes up. Look, I'm not gonna keep you any longer. I'm on my way to physical therapy. I just wanted to stop by and say congrats again. - I appreciate it. Anytime you wanna talk, just come on by. My door's always open.
