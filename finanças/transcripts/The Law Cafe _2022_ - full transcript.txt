(The Law Café) (All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...) (in this drama are fictitious.) (Staff ensured the animals' safety in the filming of this drama.) When did I first fall for Yu Ri? Everything was easier for me compared to other kids. I was arrogant, so, of course, I had no friends, until the day I transferred and met Yu Ri. (Spring, 2006) - Come here. - Why? I didn't do that. (Kim Yu Ri) Stop it. Cut it out. That was really loud. I had no idea. Hey, new kid. I heard you got full marks on this test. Which math academy do you go to? - I don't. - What? I don't go to one. - No way. - What? That's insane. He doesn't even study at an academy, but he takes the top of the class as soon as he transfers. Did you see Yu Ri's face? That sullen face was exhilarating. She looked awful when she lost her place at the top. She was always so dramatic, so I knew she'd end up like that. She's not going to make it big. What? Sweet, isn't it? It's always the sweetest to see other people fail. But don't make it so obvious. It makes you look pathetic. I have... no idea why five is the answer no matter how long I look at it. Can you teach me? Okay, look. That might be the day when it all started. Or this could be the day. - Let's get tteokbokki. - Sure. Hey, we're getting tteokbokki. Squirrel Snack Bar. That place is too spicy. Let's dip tteokbokki sauce with steamed lung. Should we get ramyeon too? I'm starving. Eggs, blood sausage, and lung. Goodness. What will I do with this poor kid? You're taking that helpless path. Yu Ri is especially clueless in the romance sector, so she won't get it even if you asked her out. What are you talking about? Hey, don't worry about it. I got your back. I always hoped Yu Ri would find someone... and start dating too. Hey, I'm starving! Hurry up! - Okay. - Okay. Let's go. Wait up! It's been too long, so I can't even remember. How can I have a crush on someone for 17 years? I just... don't have to meet her. Even if I don't meet her, I continue to see her everywhere. It's a little tormenting... and painful to think of Yu Ri. But because we can't hurt each other, it's immensely peaceful... and safe. I read it over, and I signed it too. From now on, I'll only text you according to Article Three, unless it's absolutely important. When I run into you, I'll skip my hello and greetings. I'll stay away from the rooftop or the exterior stairway. Also, I'll keep the rest of 125 articles... on my mind and abide by them, so I hope we can get along as the landlord and a tenant. You will... accept everything here? It's a ridiculous power trip from the landlord's part, but what can I do? Party B has no choice... but to go with it. That's the sound of my sign going up. It'll be done before lunch. Goodbye, then. (Episode 2: How to Love One Woman for 17 Years) (The Law Café) (Law Café) - Hello. - Yes, hello. - Are you Joon? - Yes. You got here early. I saw your resume. You're attending a law school. Yes, I'm taking some time off. Are you sure you want to work here? I wouldn't call this place a law office. It's more of a café. I'm not looking to practice law... Hey, Yu Ri. Joon. Do you see that landlord in a stretched-out sweatsuit? Will you tell him to stick to the contract... and refrain from seeing each other unless it's absolutely necessary? Sorry? Technically, Party A is allowed to visit Party B when he must. See? You haven't read it through. What kind of an unfair contract is this? You banned me from talking to you. Hey, adult man. No way. Are you here to work at this ridiculous café? Yes, if you just give me a chance, I'll do my best! (Resume: Bae Joon) You're taking time off from Hanguk University's Law School? Shouldn't you be studying for the bar exam during the leave? Or you should be an intern at a law firm. Why are you here? That's what I'm worried... I get that you're the landlord, but who do you think you are to meddle with my recruitment? Look. Article 63, Clause 1 on the contract. "Party A has the right to look over the resumes and criminal records..." "of the potential employees which Party B wishes to hire." Calm down and go back to the contract. And your answer is? Well, I just thought... it looked fun. - You pass! - I passed? I admire your hopeful attitude. That's what we need here at my café. Thank you! Hey, Yu Ri. I'm sick and tired of this, so I won't try to stop you. But you know, if you're going to run a business, you must be thoroughly ready. Do you think it's easy to make coffee? You must study when to use which bean, how to grind them, and how to brew them evenly... Who are you? He's in charge of deciding when to use which bean, how to grind them, and brewing the coffee nicely too. My barista, Eun Gang. Flannel drip. This is the way to make the silkiest and strongest coffee. On top of that, I prefer rich coffee with more oil. Because with more oil, the taste and scent are more unique. The beans are... Blue Mountain. Blue Mountain blended with Kona. You're well-versed in coffee. Who did you study with? Mr. Baek, the expert of hand drip coffee? Or Tazzonoro School that only teaches the Italian style? Cheonggang Prison. Cheonggang... Ms. Kim and I have a long history. You mean, an actual prison? Why were you there? Arson. I see. Arson. That's crazy. I've never met someone who went to prison in real life. How long were you there for? Are you sure you can... abide by the contract without causing any trouble? If you break even one clause, I'll kick you out immediately. Article 103 of the Civil Act. "A juristic act contrary to good morals and social order..." "shall be null and void." Your ridiculous contract is null and void to begin with. There is nothing that's contrary to good morals and social order... on that contract. Article 105 of the Civil Act. "If the parties declare an intention away from provisions of statutes..." "not concerned with good morals or other social order," "such intention shall prevail." Back at you with Article 104. "A juristic act that lost fairness shall be null and void." I see, since it's null and void, this contract never existed to begin with. - Get out of here, now. - You! You darned and cursed jerk. I let you have your way because we're friends, and do you now think this is a joke? Do I look like a pushover? I said I'll let you have your way, so why do you continue to nitpick over every petty thing? Enough is enough! Got it? Cold water. Ms. Kim, you should calm down. - Joon. - Yes? Please tell our dearest landlord... to go back upstairs, will you? Yes, Ms. Kim. Please leave, Mr. Landlord. Let's go. You don't have to see me off. My heartbeat never went over 100 for the last year. Look at this. This happens as soon as Yu Ri comes. Man, nice weather. - Just you? - Yes. No, Ms. Kim said this is for you. Good grief. Goodness. Cheer up. My father also shudders for a few seconds... after my mother gets mad at him. But they make up in a few days anyway. Have some rice cake too. - It's okay. - Come on, try some. Isn't it good? Why are you eating that? We can eat it together, right? Good grief. I thought this would look good at your café, Ms. Kim. - It's pretty. - Yes, it's very pretty. I was going to go upstairs... and visit you first, Dr. Park. Why don't you come with me to the café... and have some coffee? Should I do that? What's wrong? Wait, I remember this. One second. What could this be? Why was this on my head? Man. I feel so sick. Is this indigestion? (Law Café) I don't think I'll be able to sleep in peace... without telling you this. Actually, the owner of the tarot café... ran out of that place after seeing a ghost. That's why your landlord is doing his best to stop you. Ms. Hwang, even if I was scared of everything, but ghosts? I'm not scared of that. Those who are alive are scarier than those who are dead. Right? (Barun Mental Health Clinic) Goodbye. Ms. Kim, what brings you here? Dr. Park. I keep hearing weird banging sounds... at the café downstairs. It's empty right above the café. My clinic is rather quiet. I wonder where the sound is coming from. It's empty? That's impossible. I heard it loud and clear. Darn. Darn it. Who... Who are you? I heard what you said at the clinic. You said... you're hearing banging sounds. At times, don't you want to just kill everyone? What... do you mean? I thought you would understand me. Yu Ri! Call the police! You! Darn you! Stop! Stop it! Stop! Hey, you jerk. You jerk. You're dead. Hey, you jerk! Stop that now! You're here for legal counsel? I'm so sorry. It's a noise issue. Noise from above is like murder. A very slow murder. You must be very troubled because of the noise issue. I haven't slept for a second over the last three days. Goodness. If there's anything I can do to take legal action, I'll be glad to help. It may seem impossible to resolve noise issues, but as long as you have enough proof of damage, you might be able to find a way. But it's getting a bit late, and I want to take some time to look through the materials. How about we talk more tomorrow? Sure. Sorry, sir. Hey. What's wrong? Are you hurt? Did you get hit earlier? "How about we talk more tomorrow?" I thought I should talk to him tomorrow since you're not well. He was carrying a hammer. Why'd you tell him to come back? And why are you sorry? I didn't want you to get in trouble. I know he hit you back, but you attacked him first. Are you worrying about me right now? You're the one that's causing the most trouble for me. You're being rude, but I'll let it pass. I know you're in shock. Let's head upstairs. You can lie down while we talk. Hey. What do you mean? Lie down and talk? Look. You can't even stand up. You are hurt. Okay. You need to go to the hospital. Hey. Why are you touching my chest? I didn't touch anything. You touched my chest just now with your right hand. Hey. - How can you joke around now? - I'm not joking around. According to Article 298 of the Criminal Code, sexual... If you're so upset about it, you can touch me back! Ever since you got here, you come up to my rooftop and come into my room whenever. Do you know how many clauses of our contract you're breaking? Your body hurts, but your mouth seems totally fine. You have an upset stomach again, don't you? You always get an upset stomach when you eat rice cakes. You're the one who gave them to me. That doesn't mean you should eat it. I can't believe I'm hearing this from Kim Yu Ri, the person with the most sensitive stomach in the world. We should prick your finger. Do you have a needle? It's in the closet. It's in the next one over. Here? ("Probation." Shameless Despite Fatal Accident...) What are you doing What are you doing? Why do things always get in my eyes? Is this fine dust or micro fine dust? You should go home. Right. I was just about to. Gosh, I'm tired. Take some medicine and rest. That's mine. Right. I got confused. Gosh, I'm tired. I'm exhausted. You usually gulp down pasta like a starving puppy, but today, you're just pushing the noodles around. I know something's wrong. I'm not interested, but I'll listen. What is it? Okay. So, when someone comes closer to you, your reflexes may tell you... to close your eyes, right? What are you talking about? It's just your reflexes working, right? It's one of those mysteries of the human body. Right? Why do you sound so drunk? You didn't even drink much. This is precious time I could've been using... to practice giving water birth with Se Yeon, you know. Gosh, you're so petty. I'm so sorry. Fine. I'll go. Hurry up and go home to Se Yeon. I was going to do that anyway. Gosh, I'm tired. You're not going to eat this, right? Hey. How do you make porridge? Just boil some water and rice. Just water and rice? Water and rice. Don't be dumb by drinking coffee and eating ramyeon when you're sick. Eat this vegetable porridge that your tenant kindly prepared for you. That's all. Goodbye. Did you know that food waste... costs our economy over 20 billion dollars every year? Even now, there are 1.2 billion people... around the world who are starving. But I still couldn't eat it. It's hard... for porridge to taste bad, but she did it somehow. You could say... it tasted poor. (The owner gives free legal advice.) (Law Café, You can get legal advice at Law Café.)

Sixteen. Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen. Twenty. Twenty seconds. - I did it in 17 seconds. - Seriously. I heard this was a café that gives legal advice. I'm definitely going to go get some advice. - Welcome! - Really? We can just get coffee. - Welcome in. - Sounds good. Welcome in. Is it okay if we just drink coffee? Of course. Come in. Thank you. By the way, what is your relationship with the girl on the first floor? We're just friends from college. But the other day, I saw the doctor on the second floor... looking at the lawyer lady with unusual eyes. - Hey. - Thank you. If you're just friends, you should help the doctor out. A doctor and a lawyer. What a good match, don't you think? People can fall in love on their own. Why do you want him to help? Hey, come on. It's spring. Hey, look. Dr. Park is going into the café now. Hi, Dr. Park. Thanks for coming. Hello, Ms. Kim. I heard you had a hard time with my patient yesterday. He said he was sorry for surprising you late at night. It's totally fine. I opened this café to help people, just like you. I'm sorry to have caused you trouble. If I may, could I ask what that is? It's a noise meter. Try speaking into it. I feel a bit shy. Nice to meet you, Ms. Kim. Yes. Hello. It's nice to be your neighbour as well. What is it for? Oh, this. I promised to visit the guest from yesterday to verify his complaints. You're such a proactive person. Some people say I'm too rash. Would it be okay... for me to accompany you this evening? Really? That would be great for me. Go where? Are you seriously going to visit the man with the hammer? Didn't we decide not to talk to each other? Why do you keep getting in my business? Mind your own business. How can I? Are you saving the planet or something? Are you trying to be Superwoman or something? I'm not saving the planet. I'm just helping a neighbour who came to me in need. What does this have to do with Superwoman? - Hello. - He was out of his mind... - when he came to you for help. - How old are you, sweetie? My name is Bae Joon. I'm 27 years old. We each have our own stores here. - There isn't much to eat here. - Mind your own business. - But we have entertainment instead. - Why do you care? - You're handsome. - So do you think... you can convince people with this noise meter? Do you not feel fear? Don't you think or worry at all? You were so scared yesterday. Why are you visiting him alone? I'm going to go with her. What? I'm going to go with her. - What? - What? They're cousins. They're so close. They do everything together. They're best friends. I wouldn't say they're best friends. They're just... the two neighbour buffoons. I lost again. Come out. The stick. - What is this? - Come on. Okay! Are we about to see... those two split apart because of a girl? It was sad seeing two always hang out by themselves. This is great. What's great? What's great? - These sweet potatoes. - I see. Yes. They're sweet. (Happy Mart) Goodness. I think my wrist is going to give out. It's your turn. Jung Ho. Can't you just go and ask Yu Ri... when she'll be back? What are you saying? I'm really into this game, you know. Wait. You can't use those two cards together. Are you trying to cheat? I couldn't see, that's all. It's dark at night. Jung Ho. You left everything. What? The first dead body I saw... when I became a prosecutor... was of a person who got murdered... by their neighbour who complained about the noise. So what? There are 42,250 noise complaints... filed every year in this country. I admire you for trying... to help a man who's suffering because of a noisy neighbour. And I think it'd be wrong of me if I don't help. Since I have experience with this kind of case and all. Do you not feel fear? Don't you think or worry at all? That's what you were saying to me just earlier today. - Let's go. - Sure. Let's go. Did you have some customers today? No. I had some customers who just came to drink coffee. Don't worry too much. I'm sure you're going to be very busy soon. You went to Hanguk University with Jung Ho, right? Yes. We also went to the same high school. Right. I've heard about you and your friends... from Jung Ho before. You must be the pretty and fearless friend... that Jung Ho was talking about. Hey. Why did you say such a thing? I was talking about Han Se Yeon. You two don't seem... like just landlord and tenant either. He's my cousin. Really? But you two don't look anything alike. On average, cousins only share... about12.5 percent of the same genes. It's more normal that we don't look alike. Excuse me! Please be quiet! Please be quiet! Can you hear that? They won't listen, no matter how many times I ask. They must be trying to kill me by driving me insane. The generally accepted level of noise for night time is 52dB. The noise now far exceeds that. What do you think about making... a formal complaint via a legal report? Complaint? I've done that so many times now. If you use a written document, people tend to take it more seriously. If you collect evidence of your situation... by sending a legal report... and getting a medical diagnosis, you could sue for compensation. - That's right. - Do you think... those people will change? Really? (Law Café) Why? What? Why? You want to say something. Don't hold back. Just say it. You won't want to hear. Just say it. Okay. If tomorrow, the people upstairs come to you... and tell you that they're suffering because of the person downstairs, are you going to write up a legal report for them too? If so, I'd re-evaluate the situation... to understand what the issue is. As we were leaving, I saw that unit 1112 upstairs, as well as units 1011 and 1013 on either side of his place, had their lights off. Only the three units downstairs had their lights on. That man doesn't even know who's making the noise, and he's carrying a hammer around. Didn't it cross your mind that you may have encouraged him? Should I go on? No. You head in first. I have to talk to Woo Jin. What? What are you doing with Kim Yu Ri? Does it bother you... when I'm with her? Shouldn't you explain why that bothers you first? Just don't do anything to her. Don't egg her on. Don't help her. Don't be kind to her. Don't start liking her. Don't even be curious about her. What's wrong? Don't you think you're overreacting? We shouldn't... be anything for her. A friend, a coworker, or a neighbour. We shouldn't be any of those things for her. You shouldn't be... for the same reason I shouldn't. Enjoy. - Thank you. - Thank you. Right. Where did I leave off? (Lawyer Kim Yu Ri) That man doesn't even know who's making the noise, and he's carrying a hammer around. Didn't it cross your mind that you may have encouraged him? So I just left home. I went to my parents'... But since we have kids, it's hard to say anything. The people on my floor always assume that the noise... is coming from my house because I have kids. Gosh, these apartments. This is why people go crazy. That crazy guy from the tenth floor? Honestly. Don't we all empathize with him? Of course. - Oh, my. - My goodness! Do you happen to live in Pureun Apartments over there? Come in. I guess there's a baby upstairs. Actually, an elderly woman lives alone upstairs. That's why we're going crazy. We can't even tell where the noise is coming from. That crazy guy from the tenth floor... is yelling at an upstairs neighbour that doesn't exist. - That's right. - What? Nobody lives above that guy. The former resident moved out... because the crazy guy kept making such a fuss. It's been months already. So all of the noise that's coming from above... Nobody knows where it's coming from. When you knock here, you can hear it from two floors up. It's hard to hear because I recorded it on my phone, but the whole apartment is not soundproofed at all. In order to soundproof apartments, you simply have to make... the floors thicker. But since it increases the construction cost, everyone makes the floors as thin as possible. What year was the apartment built? It was built in 2007. It's not even that old. The age of the building... doesn't matter, actually. I think starting in 2004, they implemented a recertification policy. People were able to use a sample... prior to starting construction for approval, and nobody checked... whether they used the same material in the actual construction process. So there was no reason... for construction companies to do a thorough job. Pureun Apartments. (Pureun Apartments) (Construction company, Dohan Construction) (Number of units: 500) (Construction company, Dohan Construction) (Construction company, Dohan Construction) As such, we find the defendant, Lee Pyeon Woong, innocent. (Construction company, Dohan Construction) I learned that nobody lives in the unit directly above you. What do you think about suing... the construction company? Yes, Ms. Kim. I understand what you're saying. Yes. Please give it some thought and let me know. My dear landlord, I keep hearing noise coming from upstairs. We must sit down and discuss this issue. I told you not to text me after the sun sets. Let me spell it out for you. I do not want to be bothered at night. Well, what can I do? It keeps happening at night, Mr. Landlord. - You hear something from upstairs? - Yes. Every night, I hear a loud clunking noise as if someone's walking. But no one is upstairs. So what could it be? I'm so scared that I can't focus on anything. Where is the sound coming from? You probably have no idea, but noise problems can drive you crazy. If you ever experienced it, you'd be able to relate to it. I see. So since you can relate to it now, you plan to make everyone sue each other? Is that your solution? No. I looked into it again, and everyone in the building is experiencing noise problems. So? Like you said, making the neighbours sue each other... won't solve the problem. So... I'm going to file a damage claim against the construction company. Have you finally... - lost your mind? - Yes. Just like Se Yeon, I'm pretty, bold, and fearless. Since I've already started this business, I plan to stick my nose into everyone's business. Good for you. Very impressive. And it was built... by Dohan Construction. Do not get your personal feelings involved. I looked into it. The post-construction flooring noise standard is a joke. And, of course, Dohan Construction didn't even comply with it. Kim Yu Ri. I bet the Law Café is just an excuse. What you're really after is your father's case. Am I wrong? - You are wrong. - Why can't you... Why can't you move on from the past you should leave behind? You are the one who can't move on from the past. That's why you're so uncomfortable that I've come back into your life. Am I wrong? Sorry to disappoint you, but I've moved on. A life filled with nothing but anger and resentment... It was just too miserable, so I've moved on. My dad doesn't drink. Even a single drop of alcohol makes his face turn red, so he doesn't drink. Please do something. You must do whatever it takes to prove it. That is justice. I must follow the procedures, so be patient. "Procedures"? Who cares about that? A trial isn't about drawing the right conclusion. It is about following the right procedures. I'm sorry, but this is the kind of justice the law talks about. Dad... Dad! Yu Ri. - Thank you! - Thank you! Kim Jung Ho. Why are you avoiding me? That day, I gave you that look... because I needed someone to take my anger out on, and you happened to be in front of me at that moment. But was it the fifth book in the series? It says... you'd be angry at the world when you experience a misfortune, but it's important to remember exactly what you're angry about. I don't resent you or your father. That day, I was out of line because I was just so angry. I believe... he did his best within the bounds of what he thinks is right. So... don't avoid me, please. My dad suddenly passed away and is facing unfair accusations. I'm in 12th grade now, but my mom is busy dealing with all the legal matters. I'm having a really hard time. So if you're like this too, what am I going to do? Hey! - Come here. I must punch you again. - Hey! No! I was just being silly. I was talking about serious stuff. How could you prank me? Calm down. Isn't she so cool? I would not have been able to say that. So I shamelessly stayed by her side... because I believed... that my father... was simply following his principles at the time. - He's inside, right? - Prosecutor Kim. - No, Prosecutor Kim! - Let go! Prosecutor Kim. You can't do this. Everyone is already talking about us. Must you add fuel to the fire? So it was all you, Father. What do you mean? The fire at Dohan's warehouse in 2006. The person who messed up the investigation... and ordered them to close this investigation on Dohan. It was all you! The statute of limitations on that case has already expired. Why dig it up? I only did what I had to do before they said... I was wilfully letting it slide. No, that is not true. You stopped the investigation to hide something... as the Dohan family's son-in-law! (Deputy Chief Prosecutor Kim Seung Woon) When your mother married me, she cut all ties with the Dohan family. We have nothing to do with that family. Father. If we have nothing to do with them, then why are you being like this? That case! It ended up in someone else's hands, so we almost couldn't prosecute the case. I was the one who salvaged it and indicted Lee Pyeon Woong. But you couldn't even file an appeal. No matter what you say, I still do not regret the choice I made back then. You see, I do not know what it is that you're trying to protect, but I can tell that it's not the law. (Kim Jung Ho, Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office) Hey! Kim Jung Ho. What are you doing here? Hey, Kim Yu Ri. Yes. I was waiting for you, Yu Ri. I was... Hey! Are you all right? I know I'm shameless, but I can't do this anymore. What are you talking about? I'll really miss you. (Lee Pyeon Woong) (Dohan Construction, Dohan Heavy Industries) (Palacio Hotel) (Palacio Hotel) Sir. Mr. Hwang of Law Firm Hwang and Goo is here. My gosh, hello. Oh, no. Hey, go home. Get out! Gosh, this is bad. I need to sober up. Oh, boy. Don't worry. This is what they get to do when they work for me. Slapping their boss to sober him up. Oh, boy. ("The Punisher of Evil Corporations") So? This is the first project we're working on together. Did you have a chance to go through everything? I've reviewed everything, and it seems that... some details were indeed inspired... by you and Dohan Construction, but most of it is fictitious anyway. In my opinion, this shouldn't really be a problem. Gosh. But you see, I can't just think of this as one of those web novels and let it go... because it's very realistic and detailed, as if it was written by an insider... who knows everything. It does look like the writer did a lot of research. However, it's not targeting Dohan Construction. As you can see, there are a bunch of other companies... mentioned in the story, so... Hey, Mr. Hwang. - Come here. - Why... There's this woman who gave birth to me. I mean, someone had to have given birth to me, right? Anyway, that woman was always a little nuts. Was it when I was 14? She swung a knife at my father, saying she would kill him. That's why my father has a long scar on his face. The thing is, not many people know... how the chairman got the scar... on his face. But this jerk knows about it. Also, what is this jerk's pseudonym? "Whistleblower." A whistleblower, okay? This scumbag... is doing all this work to mess with me. And what? You don't think it's a problem? Why not? Answer me, Mr. Hwang. Why not? If you act rashly, you may end up admitting that the things in the novel are true! Okay! So how do we get rid of this? We're paying you for your advice! You got the money, didn't you? You'd better not do a mediocre job. Comb through everything again with your staff. Most importantly, I must know who this punk is... no matter what! Goodness. He is awfully insecure because he was born out of wedlock. Gosh, I should not have agreed to take this on. I really should not have. (Woo Jin) - Hi, Woo Jin. - Hey, Jung Ho. Can I get Ms. Kim's number? You need her number now? Why? You remember Cho Seok Jun, right? From Pureun Apartments. We should stop him now. But I'm not there now. I called the police just in case. What are you talking about? He called me a moment ago and said... he talked to Ms. Kim in the evening. Taxi! But he said he was on the rooftop. Pick up, please! Please. Hey, what's up? - Oh, no! - Is he going to jump? My gosh. Oh, dear. Kim Yu Ri, what exactly did you tell him? Explain. His upstairs neighbour got a place somewhere else... a few months ago because he kept complaining. But I guess he didn't know. I suggested filing a lawsuit... and brought it up. I suppose it shocked him. I'm on my way now. Just ten minutes... No, just hold out for five minutes. - Sir. - Please get back down. - Please. - Calm down. - Excuse me, sir! - Drag him down. Do you know him? He's my brother. Hey! You remember me, right? Over here! - Gosh! - Back off! I was told that the lawyer suggested a new idea. Why are you being like this? It's all pointless. It's all useless. Why? You thought your upstairs neighbours were crazy. Turns out, you were the crazy one. Is that why you want to die? What are you doing? Are you really his family? Or... do you want to jump off the roof and die... to get back at everyone... who lives in this building? Hey! "March 17, 11:12am. Someone was practicing the piano." "At 12:39pm, someone was cooking." "March 18, 1:20am." "Unexplained TV sounds." "March 19, 4:12am" "Unexplained ball rolling rounds." You recorded everything in such detail. You've been bottling up your anger, and you don't know who to take it out on. You must be so frustrated. But you're barking up the wrong tree. You are blaming the wrong people. This is so wrong! What do you even know about me? Do you know what I've had to put up with? No one knows! Nobody knows! That doesn't mean you can go ahead and explode at everyone! When you experience a misfortune, you must stay focused... so you won't misdirect your anger. Don't take it out on random people like a coward! You'd be angry at the world when you experience a misfortune, but it's important to remember exactly what you're angry about. The lawyer has managed to find the culprit. Right? So let's fight together. You don't have to fight alone. Here. We will win. You'll be compensated for everything you've had to put up with. And we'll make sure those scumbags... can't build apartments like this in the future. So... please hold my hand, okay? - Hurry! - Gosh! I know you were in a rush, but wear your cardigan properly. Kim Jung Ho. I feel weird. My heart is... pounding. (The Law Café) So you'll actually sue Dohan Construction? You'll lose, 100 percent. So suggest another solution, then. Why are so many people trying to mess with me these days? The fact that a video like this is already going around... We can move on to the next step, right? - Go for it. - Okay! What a relief! It's because they're fearless. If you try to mess with Kim Yu Ri again, I will shred you to pieces. (The Law Café)
