SHISHI PRODUCTIONS WIFE COLLECTOR Screenplay: Tetsutami Oka Assistant Director: Masahiro Kasai Cinematographer: Koichi Saito Music: Ginza Sound Starring: Minako Ogawa Naoko Takeda Naomi Hagio Katsumi Ohtaki Taketoshi Watari Ryuhei Kunieda Maritoshi Ishikawa Kazuo Ohtani Isao Nonaka Yutaka Ikejima Director: Hisayasu Sato Hey you! Can you turn that noise down? I have a headache... that's not helping. Sorry. Can't you be more considerate when you have a passenger? I hate it when somebody pushes their music on to me. Stop it! What are you doing? Did you hear something? A weird sound... Something in the trunk? It's a pig. Eh? What? I found a female pig. A female pig? Really? I heard that you didn't respond to the radio. I don't appreciate that kind of behaviour. Picking up passengers on the street isn't enough... or maybe you couldn't hear the radio because of your music? Not only the dispatcher, but your customers also often complain. Refusal of destination... rude attitude... loud music... reckless driving. This is not just your problem... it affects the company's reputation. Can't you try to be more conscientious? Understand? Yes. What's wrong? You scared me, sitting there alone in the dark. Are you scared? - What? Are you scared of men? This room smells like men... I hate it. Isn't that right, dollie? Is this a joke? Of course. If it weren't a joke... I'd be a retard. When did you get home? - Why? I'm asking you 'when'? After you came home. Really? Why don't you ask where I've been? Even if I did... you'd only lie. You don't like them? - What? My lies. I'm pissed off. Is being quiet better than lying? Maybe quiet is better. Misaki! There is a message from your husband. I am staying at the same place, Tokai Hotel. I'll be here any time after 10. Call me, if you need to. I'll be home tomorrow. Goodbye. Who the hell are you? "I am the only gift from your only sister." These recent taxi robberies are a modern criminal activity... which considers the cab as a confined environment. Therefore, we have developed a new instrument to fight this type of crime... a tear gas canister. When you feel in danger... you press this button and the gas disperses in the attacker's face. But before the gas has had a chance to work, you've already been shot by a gun. Even a knife, held like this, makes it impossible. Right? Well... you might have a point. Then let's say the crime is committed... everything could be recorded on this compact video camera. Excuse me... Doesn't your air conditioning work? - Eh? What is this? Dirty... The odour of your sweat is much dirtier! Can you stop, please? I want out. Stop! Where are you going? I didn't ask to go this way. What are you doing? Yes - are you ready? Oh... Isn't that enough? Just one more shot. That's it. Let's have dinner. Are you feeling better, Misaki? - Kinda. You never show me your photos. - Want to see? - Yeah. Here. - Thanks. How long can you stay for this time? Well... a week or so. Hey... - Yes? You want me to shoot your 'steamy' moments? What are you saying, school girl? Even if you say no... I can sneak in. Misaki! I believe we have an in-house paparazzi! This is so tough. - Really? You like tough meat, 'cause you have good teeth. Misaki may try to sneak in here. If she does... then she'll be living alone. 17 years old is a mature woman. Even though I'm her in-law, I can't ignore her charms. Husband! Stupid! I'm joking. 1, 2, 3... I'm leaving now. Be careful. See you later. Has he gone? - Yes. Really? I wanted to show him my photos. You have that look... like you want a man so badly. You aren't satisifed by normal sex, since you got raped. Sister... Sister! What's wrong? Sister! What's wrong? Do all women become like you when they get raped? Take it off. - Okay. Come here. We can't come to the phone right now... please leave a message after the beep. It's me. I just got to Osaka. The room number is 1265. If you need me, call me here. Brother... Hello... so you're at home. What are you doing? I'm in Osaka. I'm on a business trip. You left my sister alone. Hey, hey! I'm working hard doing my job. Right now... she's having sex with other guys. No charge. What? What did you say? My sister went out to give her body to men. What? You came all this way to give away sex. You came to spread your legs for dirty men. Yes. But it's none of your business. I can have sex with anybody I choose. You were smiling whilst they fondled between your legs. So? So what? Then sex with me must be a good memory. - Eh? It's me. I just got to Osaka. The room number is 1265. If you need me, call me here. Hello..? Misaki! Pick up the phone again. Misaki... you said Akiko was having sex with other men? What are you saying? Pick up the phone. Hello? Misaki?! Your silence suggests you're guilty. Are you guilty? What has made you unhappy with our life? Where to? Anywhere. You want to go to the park, or to the zoo? What is this? What do you think? Just a hole... still clogged. I am a copy of the woman you raped... the one who bit your shoulder. I'm here to see if the same thing will happen to me. No way. No! You asked to be raped. Then do it! Where's brother? He went out. - Really? What's wrong? Can't you tell? You should recognise the smell. I got raped by 'him'. - 'Him'? I've become just like you. What are you saying, Misaki? 32-6-02, come in. Yes? Go to Honmachi 2-chome. Pick up at Nozawa on the corner. Special request for you. For me? Maybe somebody likes your music! About your sister, right? It was your sister's fault. You still want to have sex with me? Everything started after I got raped by you. So... it's time to put an end to this cycle.
