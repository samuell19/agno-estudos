Oskar Åbb 22, farmer In March 1916, I got married to Selma Henrika from my home village. In autumn 1917, I joined the secret civil guard of Korsnäs, and participated in drills and patrols. In the beginning of March, I was called to the youth center, from where I continued to Vaasa and enrolled in Melin's company. I'm the third youngest of 12 siblings. Edvin Häger, 25 farmer Three siblings died at birth. In autumn 1917, I enrolled in the Uusikaarlepyy civil guard, and PE teacher Böök drilled us in the yard of the teachers' college.

Senior lieutenant Erik Gunnar Melin A soldier's duty is to love God and the fatherland. TAMPERE, Russian barracks 3 April, 1 a.m. You die for them if necessary, for God, when He created us, outlined the number of our days, as well as the form and tasks of our lives. Should it be God's will that we shall fall on the battlefield, we have no influence whatsoever on the matter. With God's help, as is proper for a man, we shall do our duty to the country that has raised us. 28 January 1918, civil war breaks out in the new Republic of Finland. The country is divided into the bourgeois white and socialist red. Carl Gustav Mannerheim is appointed the commander of the White Army. World War I is in its fourth year. Senior lieutenant Melin and other jaegers return from Germany, and disembark in Vaasa on February 25. On March 15, Mannerheim's army launches an attack on the reds in southern Finland. Two days later, Melin's company proceeds from Vaasa, towards the front in the south. The red troops retreat gradually towards Tampere. On March 26, the White Army, under Mannerheim's command has besieged red Tampere. Colonel Ausfeld has decided to make our company a Stosstruppe, which will take the front. We shall march into the city, go past the Russian church, proceed over the falls, all the way up to the Häme Museum, the Näsilinna palace, which we shall seize at any cost.

I'm not hungry. Shall we write "Melin's company" here? - Yes. Let's have a look at the ruins the reds have left in their wake. They burned farms and left thousands of people without a home. We must be brave, go to the battle, and save our country from bandits, who tried to declare their freedom with violence and swords. Anyone weakened by sickness or bad nerves, should step forward. Take him away. We must despise death. Our mission is difficult, hut we shall get promotions afterwards. Just how many will come back alive! Are there others who want to go home? The barracks are here. We'll proceed towards the railway, cross it, and continue towards the Russian church. We'll pass the church from the south, move up north to Hämeensilta bridge, over the falls, towards Läntinen katu street, and then straight up north towards Näsilinna palace. To my dear family hack home. I'm sending my love to you all. We're in the village, but we'll probably leave at night. I guess we'll storm the city at night or in the morning. That's why I wanted to write you a line or two. So far I've been healthy, or lucky enough not to be wounded, but you never know what's to come. I don't mind too much, come what may, but you may feel worse about this. Let's hope that everything goes well. We just need to get there, and cleanse Tampere for good. I'm sending you some money: 505 Finnish marks and 17 German reichsmarks. I gave the money to Uno Björndal from Vaasa, and should I fall in battle, he'll deliver the letter and the money. I finish the letter in thanks and love to all of you at home. Johannes. Say hello to everyone I know, and all the girls hack home. RUSSIAN BARRACKS 3 a.m. the same night Start running! Forward, march! Short gaps! March, march! On the ground! Take cover! Forward! Forward, forward! Go round the church from the south! From the south side! Stop! Turn around, damned butchers are trying to get in the city! Damn it! Who are you? Are you a red! Forward! Let's cross here. Axes! Down! On your knees. Damn it. We can't cross the bridge. They have machine guns and chevaux-de-frise. Can we cross further in the south? Lieutenant Melin! Machine guns and medics have fallen behind, and 20 men are missing. - Give me a riﬂe, and I'll shoot him. There you go. No, no! This way. You'll get through from here. Bam! Bam! Bam! Make way. Boys! Out of the way. Don't worry. It's alright. No, not there! - Show us. Don't go up there. The reds' machine gun is there. Go towards Hallituskatu street, it's on the right from the gate. Got it. Hands up! Ruki verh! Hände hoch! Are you a red? - I'm just a horseman. Forward! Vorwärts! Vorwärts! Vorwärts! God damn it! At 5 a.m. on Maundy Thursday we received an order, to fortify the reserve battalion, to extend the ﬂank to the left. We had to replace 3rd company from Oulu. Captain Bonsdorff threatened with a Mauser. A well-equipped soldier from Oulu said: "If the Swedes won't go to the front line, neither will the Finns." I was bayoneted. In the evening we found our way back to our company, and told the men from Oulu to go back. Holm shot two men who refused the order. Get up and move forward! LÄNTINEN KATU STREET 4 a.m. - after an hour of attacking This is the half-way point. Did you get bread'! - First thing in the morning. I hoarded as there was so much this time. Did you desert? - Go back to the front! Butchers! - Are you butchers? Go home, girl! NÄSILINNA PALACE 5 a.m. - two hours after the start Grenades! I'm going in. Surrender! Stop! - Don't shoot, we are whites, too! I'm not a soldier. I work here. I'm not a soldier. Captain! My name is Jörgen Johansson. I'm a coppersmith from Stockholm. I work here. I'm not involved in the war. We were told not to take prisoners. Captain, please, I speak Swedish like you. Captain! Captain! We all speak Swedish. Captain! Hold your head up high. 15 men, take your positions. Ready! Aim! Fire! You bloody butchers, can't you shoot? Shoot! Shoot! We reached the final point. Give me two reds. Two men check the cellar. Boström, check the roof. Holm! Oh, well. Here we have some fine womenfolk of Tampere. We only stayed a few days in Vaasa. A one-day drill in the market square and a one-day shooting drill. Then it was on to Haapamäki and from there to Keuruu, where we had another tough drill. In Keuruu, we lived at the association house. Our Chief Warrant Officer, Jaeger Johannes Huuhtanen, shot himself in the parsonage sauna. It was said that lieutenant Ilander had told Huuhtanen off, for being too slow. To top it all, they said Huuhtanen had two brothers who were red. It's a nice view to the lake. - Yes. There are no other companies in sight. We did well. - We sure did. Can I have a light? We're alive, though bullets swished past our ears and legs. And we shot. I shot. I was there when we executed 16 Russians at Uusikaarlepyy. Granath fell at Messukylä, Hugo and Verner got off unscathed. We slaughtered a pig and ate pancakes that were made of chalk. Now our job is done, and we can relax. Damn it! - There's no-one else here. Let's take it over there. 9 a.m. This is a good place. Pull the legs out. We have to secure our position. You two go to the east side. You two go to the western end. You three go to the north and you two to the south. The lever. What? The safety catch. - What? Release the safety catch. Hey, take him inside. Company commander Melin! What shall we do? - Shut the door! What is it? What shall we do? When will the other companies arrive? If we don't hold our positions, we'll get shot as well! I wish the help would arrive. I still want to peel pitwood in Korsnäs. I'm going to promenade on the Esplanadi in Helsinki. Save ammunition. Can I have a drag? 1 p.m. Come here! Damn it. Load, load! God damn it, they'll pepper us dead! Reinforce... How dare you leave your position? On whose order? Go back! Isn't there anyone else? - Go back! Shoot before they load the cannon. Don't shoot! We're looking for our boys. Don't shoot! We're looking for our boys. - Don't shoot! We're looking for our boys. - Don't shoot! Should we shoot? - I don't know. Lieutenant Holm! Shall we shoot? Don't shoot. - Shall we let them through? Let them through. We're looking for our boys. - Our brothers. Do you reckon we'll get help? - I don't think so. The help should arrive soon, if we want to make it out of here alive. 6 p.m. What is it? Something's wrong. Stay low! Damn it. Are you hurt? - Yes. Shoot before they get close enough to throw grenades! Is it better to fall in battle or get shot against the wall? Take cover, Söderman! - Not now. I've got him in my sights. He's behind the tree. Söderman says he has shot at least 121 Russians. He's one hell of a butcher, literally. Exhale. God damn it, you had to get shot. Hang in there. Medic! Medic! Medic! - Come upstairs, Åbb. Nordling is wounded. Medic! Medic! Hang in there, Oskar. Down! Down! You'll be fine. On the front, you get so used to seeing bodies, you pretty much start to ignore them. Unless it's someone you know, of course. There was a body on the doormat of our lodgings, in Järvensivu, a suburb of Tampere. No-one bothered to move the body. Everyone had to step over it to get in and out. Stop, get back inside! - Stop! Stop, get back inside! Get back! Hold the positions! Get in the window, boys! Save ammunition! Give up? Not a chance. Surrender? No way in hell. We won't surrender, but save one bullet for yourselves! Save one bullet for yourself. I'd rather shoot myself than surrender. Korsbäck! All fairest beauty Heavenly and earthly Are you holding up? - Sure. Do you have cartridges left? - A few. Are you wounded? - No, I'm still alive. Was it bad? Get up. Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come... I got a bayonet through the middle finger in a combat drill in Keuruu. The boy who stabbed me was from Uusikaarlepyy. He fell when we were guarding the hospital. I don't remember his name. Lieutenant Melin said I'm not to tell the wounded, that the company will break out of here in an hour. The boys are weary, and there's no ammunition left. Our only chance is to go up north towards the Näsijärvi lake. Fine. Lieutenant Melin decided we shall leave. Wait for the signal. We'll leave on Melin's signal. - I'm coming with you. We'll leave on my signal. Wait for the signal! Oskar, Oskar. Lieutenant Melin said we are leaving Näsilinna. The wounded must be left behind. I can't leave you here, not in that condition. You'll get shot if you don't leave. I'll be okay. No, Oskar, I'm not going without you. They're leaving now. Go, so we won't both die. You just rest. I'll come and get you. Will they leave us here? Let's get out. Forward, forward. Don't leave us here! Don't leave us here! Do you hear me? Don't leave us here! 9 p.m. - 18 hours from the start ♪A mighty fortress is our God♪ ♪A bulwark never failing♪ ♪Our helper he amid the ﬂood♪ ♪Of mortal ills prevailing♪ ♪For still our ancient foe♪ ♪Doth seek to work us woe♪ ♪Arise, ye workers♪ ♪from your slumber♪ ♪Arise, ye prisoners♪ ♪of want♪ ♪For reason in♪ ♪re volt now thunders♪ ♪And at last♪ ♪ends the age of Kant♪ ♪Away with all your superstitions♪ ♪Servile masses, arise, arise♪ After dark, comrades slid away one after another. I tried to follow, but saw seven reds walking on the tracks towards me. I hid between the timber piles. Later, I tried to sneak away again, but met a Russian soldier. Stop! - Don't shoot. Sit down! I'm a regular man. He was hiding, too. I didn't dare shoot, as there were no other shots heard. So instead I shouted: Sit down, I'm not a bad man. I'm not a soldier, nor an officer. 6 a.m. next morning Don't shoot! Take the Germans out! Stop! What did you say? He's not German, he speaks Swedish. Hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will he done, on earth as it is in heaven. Water... Your name is Oskar, right? - Have you seen Johannes, my brother? No, unfortunately not, but everything will be alright. Look at me and listen to my voice. The worst is over. There's an ambulance for you. -My brother... Does it hum. -The bullet hit me in the back and came out my stomach. 9 a.m. the same morning Don't shoot! Red bastards! Take them against the wall. Don't shoot. We're from Melin's company. 2nd Jaeger regiment, 6th battalion, 1st company. I was shot in the stomach. Stop! - Don't shoot! I'm one of yours. 2nd Jaeger regiment, 6th battalion, 1st company. Lieutenant Melin's company. Messukylä? That way. My son Albert Nygård wrote home to his friend Albert Vik, and told Albert to tell us not to grieve over his dead body, because should he fall, he'd fall for law and justice. And Vik was not to show the letter at home, before the body had been sent home. My son was shot. The bullet hit his left eye and came out of the back of his head. Like he'd been hit with an axe. When his body was found, his watch, 500-600 marks and shoes were gone. Albert was buried in a soldier's grave in Esse. On April 6, the White Army conquers Tampere.
