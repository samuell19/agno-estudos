He jumped a little. So... - Next… above. Up then. - Move! Even higher. No see, like that. - Ah … don't you see, sisters? I'm as slender as a tiger... … and agile as a lynx. - But flickering like a parrot. - No above. Even higher, Lucica . Next, Ilinca . Faster, Lenuţa . - As you wish, Poison . - Once again. Don't be afraid. Run… run! No … above. Carefree. Yes, like that! It's not possible for Prince Velen to E Ee ... - Slender as a tiger. - And agile as laughter. - But wet as a frog. - Oh ! Help... Help — help. - He's drowning. Quick. Hold me. - Poison ... - Stupid ' e, stupid ' e. - Ştrengar ' e. - Poznaş ' e. - Terrible. And those, please, are royal children. - Your children. - My children. And what should it be? I'm just an understanding person, aren't I? But, Kasperluş , the deceased queen was such a madwoman. - And well who's throwing nanny beetles in bed, hm ? - But well who instigated me to do it, hm ? That doesn't even seem true anymore. If only the prince would wake up. But no, that's just the trick. And I, meanwhile, almost killed myself while ruling. - And now we're also going to rule? - But to be a bird, as you well know, I was medically recommended, because staying in the fresh air has a beneficial effect... on the exhausted mind... - But not on my rheumatism. Please, why are you dragging me with you? I won't catch your birds. You're like a little boy. - I wish I was, Kasperluş , if I were. Instead, you've been squealing lately like "the owl in the noodle" (posac, disappointed) . I'm telling you a joke you don't know yet… Three hunters were walking through the woods and - I know, first of all, they were not hunters, but soldiers... - I mean three soldiers… … but there were not three, only two… - Then two soldiers… … but they weren't walking through the woods, they were sitting in a cellar. You mess them all up. - No , then leave it... Do you remember how you taught me to be like a "duckling"... was it like that? - Flour is that duckling. That's an old, scorched duckling. - Ah , yes , with you today is ba fun. - And why should it be? I've been retired for a long time. - How well you are doing. - Yes, you're still mumbling! So. Didn't you forget anything? - Nothing, Your Highness. - Are the traps well glued? - Yes, Your Majesty. - And the glue is greasy enough? - As it should be, Your Highness. - No , then it's okay… No , look. Didn't the kids come to say goodbye? To what do I owe this honor? - That's common in good families. - That's right. No , thanks for the training. And is it just as common to get dressed in a pond? - But Daddy… - No , then… - When we were talking about what a wonderful father we are... and, as we praised and praised you, suddenly we see that... - Suddenly we are up to our waists in the water... - Yes. - So, actually, it's all my fault. - Actually, yes. If you married us, you would have peace with us. - Get married? No you should first advise me where to look for grooms for such squabbles. - In vain. - What… "business"? Do you know that word? You, who do nothing but walk all day long? - I don't go teleleu, Dad. I'm just waiting... a task… worthy of the successor to the throne. - No well. You'll have it, you offspring. I'm going to the mountains tonight. Until I return, "be king" for your sisters. - No, we don't want that... - No, damn it. - No silence, silence. What's that? But why not? Look, he's an adult male. Boy, I'm entrusting you with the princesses, and I don't think you're going to deceive my trust. - The successor to the throne... - You will collect it, wait! Just to... - No come... - No , come here. - Ăă . - No . - Poison , hop . - Masks! Sorry, Kasperluş, sorry. - That's right. And now I'm your king. Clear? - Excellent. So you're going to find us brides, yes ? - Why look for them? I've already found them. - You're kidding us. - No … if you think... - Wait. Who is? - Come with me and you'll see. - Come on. - In fact, what kind are they? - Nobili cavaleri. They set up camp not far away and I just keep looking at our castle in love. - Are they beautiful? - No … yes, boys like fir trees and hard checkered. - If you're arrogant , don't be humiliated. - Are you arrogant? He is waiting for you with open arms. No , what did I say? With open arms. - Wait… - I'll give it back to you. - Something like that... - Run ahead i - Yes . Come on. - I caught you here. - Au ! Let me go - Here it is. - Let me go. Au ! That tickle. Get over it. Stop it. Stop immediately. Au ! - Le am. Come on. - Jenante fete. Be already out of the house. No yes , but where can I find brides? What shines on you, when no one bothers you. - Poison . Aren't I embarrassed? - You are... - Vespera , who else? I will send bridegrooms to your sisters, if you grant me a wish... - No … which? - Give me a kiss. Do you know how much I saw from the heights of heaven? No one has kissed me yet. - But a single kiss for three brides would not be fair. You like? - Yes . - Mda ? - You only have three sisters, though. Not? - No , but that... Too bad… just a dream. Quick, go back to sleep. Maybe he'll come again. And what is this? - My name is The Fan . Give me your sister, Lucica, as my wife. - You could have it. But aren't you just a dream too? Please don't blow that much. I would still catch a cold. No then… then come. Pst . No . - Goodbye, sister-in-law. - Who was that? - No … un mire. - Oh … that's beautiful. - With me, such a filfizon wouldn't work. - Sour grapes (Aesop…) , sister. - No , this... - Still wasn't a dream? - Please note that now is my turn. - Command. No , just so on. - I'm just waiting for you. - Who is it again? - Eu. - Who is "I"? - Me, Selenar . I would like to marry your sister. - That depends on which. - Pe Ilinca . - That might be. Come on. So what about him? - Thanks, sister-in-law. And goodbye. - And I'm still "vinegaring"? Take look... - I'm Solarium and I'd like a wife... - My sister, Lenuţa . - Goodbye. - But we have brothers-in-law "like the world". - What exactly? What you say? - They left. With their bride and groom. - What are you looking for? - If you had seen them. How they were cooked. It was obvious that they were princes. - Princes? Were they interested in dowries? - No, not with a word. - Then they couldn't be caught. Hell, he knows where he got the poor princess lost. Probably some scammers, healers or even, God forbid, actors. Then tell me where they got to? - Vespera ar sti. - What do you say? What Evening ? - No … " Evening Star ". Are you interested in astrology? - Yes no, I'm not interested. It all started when he came to me and… - But who? - No , of course that star. - Listen, am I kidding you or what? - You're not, Daddy... but she did come here. - Then enough. If I could only think that you have them in order, I'd say go and don't come back until you bring your sisters back. But unfortunately the more I look at you... - Disappear. - I will disappear. - Velen, come back. Hear? Come back! He didn't even stop, bragging about him. Who would have thought of this boy? - He has courage. - Dar minte ba . Let my horse be saddled. - Please, please... … but won't have the courage for a long time… - Then don't chase anything. He'll be back like a rainy hen anyway. Yes. Better, Kasperluş, tell me a good joke. - A good joke? You are a wise king. - What's so funny about that? - Hm ... - Vespera , can you see me? In the evening, come to me. You'll tell me where to find my brothers-in-law, and then I'll kiss you all over. Didn't I just say that? - Too much. What can you afford, young women? The evening is mine. - Will the Lord be the bride's fiancé? - Not yet, but I'll be right back. - Maybe the gentleman has a fever or cerebral eclipse, right? What would a strawberry leaf compress look like? - Naughty tingling. - Enough with the insults! Apparently, you don't know that you have a prince of royal blood before you. - Then, of course, I bow deeply. March. And just dare to get in my way again. - And then began a great joy, and all the knights laughed until their bellies were taken, and King Arthur himself said "Ha, ha, ha, I'm so happy that I couldn't be happier. ”font … happier. That's what Merlin said… - The night will be very cold. Although I'm a cold-tempered old man, I wouldn't want to sleep in the open air today. As with such a caress, accustomed only to down feathers. Please, if he's bloated, then enjoy some colds. - What well cough… only now are worse things. - Care? - Robbers… the woods are now full of them. With bandits... - Stop saying… - No . And the one whose neck is not cut off, I'm selling it to the Turks in slavery… - But that's nonsense. - And this year the wolves have multiplied tremendously. Snakes… scorpions... - Shut up! … poisonous… - Call people. Take his torches and ride his horses. We need to find the prince now. - Yes … uf ... - Please don't you hurry. - Who are you? - Your son-in-law. - Me too. - I also Solarium . - Selenarul . - Vânturătorul . - I'm glad. Where are my daughters? - Here we are. - Tati - Tati. - Daddy '. - Tati. - Daddy. - Okay… okay, okay… be so... even if I really imagined your weddings still a little different... The sons-in-law are probably a long way off if they don't know our manners, Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first. Only in our country does anyone know that if he wants to get married, he must naturally ask his father for the girl's hand. And it must be done with the utmost respect when that father is king. Anyway, who are you, gentlemen? - I'm the king of winds and breezes. My breath kisses, burns and freezes. - I'm the king of the moon. My eye scans all the secrets of the night. - I'm the King of the Sun. My embrace offers life and death. - Well arranged by my son. " around the globe " - What are you talking about? No … what? - He swallowed his tongue. - Caut accommodation for the night. - Then look for it but elsewhere. - Crazy, you bastards. Welcome, sir, welcome. You're in luck, you just hit the best bodega in our whole country. Keep the Lord's reins, you fools. Please dismount sir. Please move on. Just come to the cellar, sir, come on... and you take the horse to the stable. Attention, here's a step... - Noroc ... - Noroc ... - Just come in, sir, come in… - Sit down, brother . Youth is always a welcome companion. I'm the knight Irene. Poor, but famous. On my coat of arms is written "Honor or death." - My coat of arms is my honesty. I'm a citizen of Agathon and I have a cloth shop, and sell it to the rich, and give to the poor. - Serve yourself. - Thanks. And I am the king's son. … Prince Velen. - Your Highness! - Well no Highness, now I'm just a simple traveler, otherwise I have enough money... but also more worries. - Can we help you somehow? - Maybe yes. If you could advise me where to find my brothers-in-law: Solari , Selenarul and Vânturătorul , I know how to reward. - I don't know those gentlemen, Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either. When you're on the road, don't brag in vain about his bag. - Povaţă of gold. - That's right. - Prince ' e, cling to these gentlemen. Even the guardian angel will not protect you better. - Only I know I'm between friends. - No . - Tavern , the best wine on the table. You are all my guests. - I hope the gentlemen were satisfied. Otherwise, just one word is enough to make it better next time. My guest is my master, and I am only his humble servant. Good morning, dear gentlemen. And good luck to you. - Friends, wait… I'm coming with you. This is my horse... … and my dagger. - Delete it . - And you have my bag... … tolbele mele... - Who is this? Do you know him? - Nu... - We just drank together all night. Well what are you crazy about? - Okay, tavern . - Good. - No don't… wait… wait, wait… Have ! No wait… Where are you going? Hear? Wait… - Don't embarrass me. - Thieves. Scammers. The robbers. The thieves. - Domnuleţ ', Domnuleţ ', such a bastard… - Stretch it , you bastard. What did they pay you for denying me? - Prince ' e! Forgive the softened old man. The cap is no longer serving, it shuts down and the memory suddenly collapses And what's left of it is just a black hole. Right now it's been blinking... Here, at this threshold, last night I greeted you politely... and then… that black hole again. - And then… after that I had everyone here. That you couldn't even bring it to the table. - No , of course. - No . - And how many were eaten and drunk. And then you spent the night here. - In the barrel. - In the barrel? - I don't even remember that accommodation. - Bad accommodation is also accommodation... This is an invoice for all expenses. - Hm ... - Pay. - With what? They cut me off with the last penny. No … allows... - No … with what… - You mean to leave me naked? - No, you can drop your shirt. - You… I don't beat old people. - Calm down, guys, calm down. The Lord will gladly and gladly pay. Good calculations make good friends. Here you have the little thing back. - You. - No … no , ha-ha . Reckless youth. To know that my heart is right and good ", I'll provide you with some clothes. Of course, unworked s are not pies (without effort… no success) . - Na . - Aha … The master is sending pies. - That one? Just... - He would let you back here until you gave up. - Then yourself? - Put them on and go. - Thank you, friends. - Hm . And now I'm going home. - Haven't you heard of any Selenar , Fan and Solar ? No , then... - Who are they? - Good guys. - God send you to me, young lady. Help the poor veteran climb this evil hill. - Glad, Mr.… Captain. - May the Lord reward you, boy. Sometimes I miss my leg a little. And if it was just the foot. The military does not benefit human health. The damn bag. It overwhelms me. Help me with it a little… You're young, you won't even feel it. - Yes . What do you have in it? An anvil? - Small alms, boy, alms... - Then you come from a rich and rich land... - You have young legs... - No ... - You're fine. That way we'll never get to the top. You know what? Take me by the back and we'll get better right away. - What? - Take my crutch... … and I'll take the bag… if it's so hard for you. How nice of us now. It is true that you will hope, but in this way you do a good deed and bring benefits to the body. I call this hitting two flies with one slap. Bend your back, I'm sorry! That's right, and we're home. Daughters, daughters, this walk has somehow worn you out. Behold , I am like a fish in water. - I'm not surprised. - Thanks. Pfui ! Pfui … water. It smells great, that cheese. So the poor beggar leaves his mouth watering. - Serve yourself. - Thank you, millions, thanks, girls. - Fresh cheese. Rye bread. Onion. - Yeah , you guessed it. - Come on, boys. Comrades. Come on, come on. Now you have us all here together… poor, poor... - Smells great! … oropsites of fate, nurtured by mercy. Come, brethren. Miss... The gentleman has a heart of gold... He will gladly share them with us... - The bread is not baked enough. - And the cheese… pfu … is not ripe enough. - Calm. We will straighten our taste immediately. - What exactly is sniffing? - Sausages, caltabos and bloodsuckers. - M · m , bleed... - My bullets are flowing again . And here it is... - My snout will burst from these flavors. - Zealous like a bee. - Rather like a wolf. - Goodbye, boy. And I'm sorry to hold you back. - There are no bathrooms . - What can you afford, you bastard? - Allow me to stop being a jerk. I call this a miracle. - Turn them back and stretch it. - If it's back, then I'll be back with interest. - No... - Guilt... I will show you... You bastard... How many to delete from here .. - Nu. - You won't run away from me, poor thing. Evening. - You were brave. - Where am I? - In the gardens of my house. - But how did I get here? And who gave me back my clothes? - Enough with those questions. Now I'm going to ask. Will you give me another kiss? - Îhî . - Enough. Are you stumbling on my feet again? Do you really know who I am? - Leave it. - It was just time to introduce yourself. - I am the wizard Pestănor , the king of all weather. And I'm coming to get my chosen one. - No. - Then come after her. - Out of my way! - No ? And it's done. Of course, how could he not be angry if I was smarter than him. Hm , how are you? - Obviously great. What will my father look like? What kind of bride will I bring? But... I promised myself to... - Let what…? … not to go home until I bring my sisters and brothers-in-law. - No you're just going to bring them with me. - Everything is so simple for you... - And it will be for you. And that will only take a little... - Don't move a step away from me today. Do you promise? - Do you think that can be endured? - Promise? - I promise. - Please come in, immature , for whatever reason. - How did you get here? - If it were up to you, then I certainly wouldn't be here. - I'm glad I drove you away. - Ha-ha , did you drive me away? Did you beat me? Did you really chain me? You poor thing. If you didn't have those three guardian angels behind you, I would have crushed you under the heel like a worm! - Which guardian angels? - Your brothers-in-law. - Lies - Wait. - Just tell her, "Lady of Beauty" (Venus) , how I'm taking the little boy by the hand. - Is that true? - Come on, stay away. Sure it will work, anyway his heart was broken . - No, blame, stay away... - No , then prove yourself... - Wait. - No. - Good morning, sister-in-law. - Unde e Vespera ? - He doesn't even know how to respond to a greeting. - How much he looked for us, and now that we're here… - Where is the Evening ? - And now it's looking for Vespera . - Why are you laughing at me? - Should we praise you? - You ruined what was possible... - Hard to help you... - What I cooked, I'll eat (I'll mess up the consequences of the groceries) . - Have fun! - All right, brothers-in-law. And remember me well. - Where are you going? - Where? No … after Vespera . - Well what, do you know where to look? - I don't know… - Pestănor imprisoned her in his city. - Where's that? - Right to the north. And if you want to come alive, never look back. - And don't step aside. - Don't stop even if you give up. - The head... - Just don't look back. - Just don't look back. - Poison, help me. - It's me, Evening . - Velen, help. - No step aside. No step anywhere. - Even if you were to give up. And if you gave up. - A valuable visit. Thanks to that fact? - You know that! - I know… I could crush you like a goose. But for helping me out of that hole, I'll spare you. But now delete it ! - I'll leave, but with Evening . - Fie. You can go with her, of course on one condition. Get in. Did you long for Vespera ? - Here you have it. See how generous I am. You can choose. - I'm getting a real one. - It's among them. If you recognize it until the clock strikes, you are both free. - And if not? - You will die. - And what awaits her? - I'll do it for my wife. Leave, as long as the weather is right! - I'll stay. - No , please. So then show me the one who will bring you life or death. - Thanks, sister-in-law. Here it is. Forgive forgive. - Congratulations. No , what are you looking at me? - You are free. Farewell. - Thanks, sister-in-law. - You can go, but alone! - Go, Velen e . - We'll go. But both! - Okay, you want to fight! It wasn't bad for a beginner. Not so fierce , save your powers! - Defend yourself! - Just serve yourself, little man ' e. Hard to have effect on me! So, for the last time. You have the free way, and me on Evening ! - Leave, honey! - Î - î ! - Poison, please! - No! - Really awesome. If I were a human being, I would burst into tears like a child. - You... On guard! Thanks, sister-in-law. - Vespera ! "Evening Star"! Evening! - Who to listen to that? Then come on. Come home once. - So we already have the lost son. Now the lost daughters... Although that's why the young gentleman went out into the world to find them... No … what will you tell us about them? - That they are fine… because they have husbands like "the world". - Hm ... - Poison ! - Lenuţa . - Sister… - Poison … Poison ... - I played it well, Kasperluş , what? … mask... We had to change our profession a long time ago. - Sisters... - Where have you been for so long? You have to tell us everything. - So we're all together again. And so it must be. - No , not everyone... - You couldn't help but argue. When everyone says… then everyone. No ... - Vespera . - Do you think I deserve such a bride? - No , from what your brothers-in-law said… - What were they saying? - No … if you want to know... Maybe that's how I taught you that not everything that glitters is gold... - And that a criminal shell can hide a good core... - And you proved that you have a good heart, brave thinking and heavy hand. - Concise , that you're as brother-in-law as he should be. - Thanks, brothers. - Thanks, brothers. - What do you mean? Are my brothers-in-law your brothers? - You have my brothers. - Yes, I have flour... - That was like in a fairy tale. Love is paradise, who will not believe it maybe the world is wandering around, but that love is paradise… I'll find out later END Love… she is, I would like sweet honey and living water to be sipped. Love holds ArminDeni in May, when feeling and fidelity and honor are added, then out of love is heaven !
