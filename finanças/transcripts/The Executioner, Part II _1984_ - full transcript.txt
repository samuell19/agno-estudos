(explosions rumbling) (explosions rumbling) (explosion booming) (gun firing) (guns firing) (explosion booming) - Jesus Christ, we're being hit by our own fire. (explosion booming) (guns firing) (explosion booming) (explosion booming) (gun firing) (explosions booming) - I'll go on ahead. - Easy Sarge, be careful. (explosion booming) - [Roger] Mike! (guns firing) - [Mike] Sarge, Sarge! Sarge, wait out, I'll save you, Sarge! - [Roger] You go on! - Sarge, Sarge, I'll get you out of here, Sarge. (guns firing in distance) Come on Sarge, get up on me. Come on, hold on! Come on. Come on. (grunting) (machine guns firing in distance) (guns firing) - [Man] Grab this. Grab it. Come on! Shit! Hold on! Hold on! (machine guns firing in distance) I'm gonna get you. Hold on. (machine guns firing in distance) - I got him. - Take him up, take him up... (man yelling) (machine guns firing in distance) (machine guns firing) (coughing) - I'm dead Mike, go on. - No you're not. (coughing) (machine guns firing in distance) (guns firing) (guns firing) (gasping) (grunting) Come on. Hey, Sarge, hold on. Hold on to me. (machine guns firing in distance) (sirens blaring) (upbeat funky music) (muffled voices on radio) - Detective O'Malley, if you just would listen to me. - This is the scene of a homicide ma'am, not a circus. - There are rumors on the street that someone called The Executioner... - Has been committing these crimes, yes, the police are well aware of these rumors. - [Reporter] Today The Executioner has struck again. Police report the fifth unsolved homicide in two weeks, and the only clue they have is that the murders were committed by someone known on the streets as The Executioner. - Come on, bitch! (woman screaming) (men muttering) (dramatic funky music) Come on, we got a space for you right here. Come on! (woman screaming) Come on, we got something for you baby. (men laughing) (woman screaming) - Oh, come here and look. Oh, what are they doing to her? (woman screaming) - Let her go, come on, ha! - You think this is foreplay for you? - Are you ready? - Come on. - Are you ready? (men laughing and chattering) - Come on, let's take her over. (men laughing) Oh yeah. - Ooh yeah. (woman screaming) (men laughing) - [Man] You'd better get ready for the king! - [Man] You're gonna get it baby. (woman whimpering) Oh yeah. (man laughing) Alright. - [Woman] Don't go up there! - Well someone has to stop them. - Well leave that to the police. - Ah. - Don't go up there. (men laughing) (woman whimpering) - Oh yeah, oh yeah. (woman whimpering) Oh. (man laughing) - What are you doing? - I don't want you going up there. (heart beating) - Well somebody's got to help her. - Oh heavens, oh. - What the hell is that? (woman whimpering and screaming) (man laughing) - Well, we did it to her, didn't we? - [Man] I'm the king and this is my crown. (laughing) - Punk! - [Man] That guy's crazy! Let's get out of here! - [Man] That dude's crazy, man! - [Man] Let's get out of here! - Fucking maggot! (man screaming) I'm your judge. I'm your jury. And I'm your executioner! (groaning) (explosion booming) - [Reporter] Police still have no idea who The Executioner is and they don't wanna talk about it. He either shoots his victims, cuts them with glass, or places live grenades in their clothes. He's cleaning out the criminals of the city, the rapists, the pimps, the drug dealers. He's doing a better job of fighting crime than the police. Maybe we would all sleep better if the police leave him alone. - Hey Mr. Casallis, I got this bill here of yours, $64. - Hey buddy, watch your mouth. - Mr. Casallis, there's $64 here on this bill. I always pay my protection money. - Of course you do. - Look, I gotta business to run here, I gotta collect on these things. - Of course you do, but I ain't paying you a red penny on that bill of yours. - What do you mean? - Let's get going. Been kinda busy. (funky keyboard music) - Boss, there's been another killing. - Ain't none of my concern. You got a girl for me? - No boss, no chicks. - Well get off your ass and get me one. - Boss, the pimps on the street say they ain't got any more chicks for you. Young ones are afraid. They don't want to turn any tricks for the tattoo man. - What the hell you talking about? Chicks call me the tattoo man? So get me some new ones. - Okay boss. - Hey Sarge, ain't nothing wrong with old Lizzy here. Throw some plugs in for you, adjust the valves. It'll be good for another 50,000 miles. - I hope so, right now a new car is out of the question. Laura will graduate next year, then she's off to college. - Geez, that kid graduates already? Seems like she was just a baby, you know when we were in uh... - Yeah, she was in the second grade when I came here. - Rog. (Mike speaking quickly) Have a cold one. You know Rog, that Anne, she was really some girl, you know? Laura's a lot like her too, you know? She's always happy and considerate. - Couldn't ask for a better kid. I wish I could spend more time with her. If Anne were still. - Hey look, let's leave it. Let's you and me go get a beer, huh? It's been a long time, what do you say? (thumping) Damn punks, I'll waste 'em! (exciting funky music) - Watch out, here comes the guy! - [Roger] You better run, you son of a bitch! (groaning and grunting) (yelling) (groaning and grunting) (whimpering) (grunting) (grunting and groaning) (exciting funky music) (groaning and grunting) (yelling) (grunting and groaning) (ominous music) - That math test sure was the pits. - It was dumb. (laughing) - The real old iron fist special. - [Girl] Uh huh. - They got some new tops next door, didn't they? - Yeah, I like them. - Are you going to the gym today? - No, too much homework. - Oh, well see you tomorrow in school. - Okay, bye. - Bye. (ominous music) (dogs barking) (heavy breathing) Did you get the stuff? - Whoa. Do you have the dough? - No, not today. - Dammit. You know the rules, kiddo, no dough, no stuff. - Come on Vance, give it to me, I need it. - Hey, my hands are tied, sorry. - Look, I couldn't get into my father's billfold, but I promise I'll have the money tomorrow. Come on Vance, you're a regular guy, give me the stuff. - I'm not a bank. I don't give credit. But. - But what? - Well, there's some ways to make money. I mean real money, not that chicken shit you steal out of your old man's wallet. But I think you're still trying to stroke me. See you around. - How can I make more money? - You know. - Mm-mm. - Hey, are you really as dumb as you act? Don't you know that hustling pays really good? A young chick like you could make all the money she wants. I'll show you the ropes, give you some leads. - You're disgusting. - Hey, what's the big deal? Dope, sex, who cares? You already screwed yourself anyhow. You'll be back, kiddo. I know your kind real well. - Pete. - Hey, Mr. Casallis. - Business been kind of slow, huh Pete? - Yeah, a little. Cops are on us pretty tight. Hey, you know how it is, those guys all wanna look good before the election. It's all bullshit. Things will calm down after the election. Business will be right back where it was. - Hope so. For your sake. - You make a joke, Mr. Casallis? - I ain't never joking. Pimps like you are a dime a dozen. (groaning) Got my point? - Yes, Mr. Casallis. - Get me a girl. - Mr. Casallis, I'm doing the best I can. - Got that pal? And don't forget, make them young and pretty. - Yes, Commissioner. I can assure you my, yes sir. We're making every effort. Yes sir. Yes, Commissioner, I agree these homicides are an embarrassment to us. - Especially since The Executioner brings the crime rate down. - I'll keep you informed sir, goodbye. - [Celia] Something you people can't do. - You again. I watched your newscast. (upbeat funky music) (crowd murmuring) - It's for that gentleman at the bar. - Mr. Eastbrook, I have a message for you sir. Thank you, sir. (upbeat funky music) - Antonio, that's exactly the reason why I've asked you to lay low for awhile. - Chicken shit. - Tony, watch your mouth. - Shut up, toots. - Please try to understand the predicament my candidate is in, his chances for election are nil, zilch. - Zilch, I gotcha. - If one word of your association leaks out, he cannot be linked in any way with the you know what. - Christ, you guys have your ass on ice the moment the heat is on. - I can assure you that my candidate is still seriously interested in the deals that we worked out but the first order of business is to find out who this Executioner is. - Yeah, we gotta get rid of that ass. - Gentlemen, I'm sorry I'm late but it was one of those endless meetings, you know? - I believe you two haven't met. Eastbrook, this is Fred Hobknoll, our police commissioner. - Oh, glad to meet you. - How do you do? (upbeat funky music) - If you want to break The Executioner case, you need all the help you can get. And I can provide, hmm, some. - You're not serious, are you? - I am serious. Sometimes people will speak to the press but not to the police. - You are serious. - There is a kingpin in the city, someone who controls all the crime. - You figure that the syndicate, as well as the police, are interested in finding The Executioner. Neither can afford to let him continue. - [Celia] Yes. ♪ Oh darling ♪ ♪ Oh darling ♪ ♪ Oh darling ♪ - I can help you really make it in this business. - I want you to teach me everything you know. I'll help you rip it. (laughing) (romantic vocal music) Is that all you want? Oh! (laughing) (screaming and yelling) (funky dramatic music) - Hey, who's that? - Come on! (men chattering and laughing) - Come on, get off! (chattering and laughing) - Sit down. (chattering and laughing) (man mumbling) - No, this ain't enough. (chattering and laughing) - [Woman] Look at her. (woman singing to herself) (woman humming) (laughing and hollering) - Right come on! - Let's get her! Come on, she must have something. - Oh wow, come on! - Hey this is good stuff here. - Get away. Give me my purse. No, give me my purse! - [Man] Give me the money! (screaming and whimpering) (funky dramatic music) (men chattering) - [Man] Look at this. - [Man] There you go. (men chattering) - We'll clean you up. Wanna get cleaned up? - Hey, you're right, come on back here. (woman screaming) (man mumbling) (men chattering) (woman screaming) Oh that looks good on you. - [Woman] Stop it! Leave me alone! (chattering and laughing) - My baby! My baby. (sobbing) - Got one fucking dollar bill, man. - Where'd you find my dollar? - Hey, what a big score. - I wouldn't do that. It's my dollar. - Hey! (groaning) Take the damn money man, take it! Just let me go. - Take off! - [Man] Son of a bitch! - So, is what I heard about you true? (romantic vocal music) Guess it is. Do it good. Oh baby, that's the stuff. - [Woman] Hey in there, hurry up and get it over with. (woman mumbling and knocking on door) (exciting funky music) (hollering and chattering) - [Woman] Hey, there you are. - Alright, come on man, let's go. - Here comes trouble! (hollering and chattering) (punks screaming and hollering) - Hey, get out! (hollering and chattering) - Leave me alone! (groaning) (yelling) (groaning) (men laughing) Stop! (man laughing) Leave me alone! - Come on, get the cash, get the cash. Hey, we better get out of here, you know we can't stay here. (screaming and whimpering) - Oh yeah! Oh yeah! - [Woman] They messed her up alright. (hollering and chattering) - Police! Police! Police! Help! - You squealer! You call the police on me and I'm gonna cut you. - Hey! - Huh? (groaning) - Asshole bastard. (man screaming) I want justice, that's all I ask. You love it or you leave it, you damn slime! Yeah. (grenade booming) (grunting) (grunting) (glass clanking) (eerie synthesized music) (helicopter chopping) (helicopter chopping) (guns firing) (grenades booming) (machine guns firing) (crashing) (upbeat funky music) (groaning and grunting) (groaning) - You're breaking my fucking neck, man! - What are you here for? - God dammit! - Who are you working for man? Who's giving you orders? Come on, who gives you orders? - Casallis, Casallis. Casallis. - Get him all the way! (eerie music) Casallis, I'm gonna take him all the way, I'm gonna take him all the way! (grunting) (groaning) (eerie music) - [Man] Wake up, wake up! - [Man] The comets. - [Man] Jump over there, beat him! Citizen! I tried it. (ominous music and mysterious voices) (helicopter chopping) (eerie music and mysterious voices) - I'll get you, you! (ominous music and mysterious voices) (machine guns firing) (mysterious voices) (laughing) - Terrific, now read the entire sentence. (speaking in foreign language) - Oh, I hate these foreign languages, ugh! (laughing) - You need one or you won't graduate. - If I don't graduate, I don't get a decent job, and if I don't get a decent job, oh Laura, shut up! I hear that shit every day at home from my mother. (laughing) - Your mother's right. (laughing) - Screw her! (laughing) Screw college and screw school! (laughing) I know better things to do than college and a stupid job! (laughing) Oh, I wish this were coke, oh heavenly coke! (laughing) - Where the hell do you find money to buy coke? - (laughing) Find it? I don't find it, I make it! (laughing) (phone ringing) (laughing) (phone ringing) (laughing) Answer the fucking phone! (laughing) (phone ringing) - [Roger] Laura? (laughing) - It's my dad. (laughing) Sure. Okay. - What's going on? Are you doing homework together? Oh okay. No, no problem. Listen, I won't be home for dinner. Mike, some newswoman and I are going out to dinner. You have something there? Oh okay, I might be late. What's going on? I love you. Laura? - He loves me. He won't be home til late. (playful synthesized music) - Great, it's party time! But, but. - [Laura] Oh well. (laughing) - What? - I need to talk to you. I need dope, Vance isn't giving me any more until I pay up. - Vance, you mean Pete Vance? Naturally he won't, cash and carry, I don't blame the guy! (laughing) - But I need it, it's not just for me, it's for Ben too. - Again? (laughing) - I love him, come on. - You love Ben? Ben's a weasel, ugh, you gotta be kidding. You buy him dope, have you been to bed with him too? (laughing) - No. - People, enter the freak show! Take a look at the last American virgin! - Come on, seriously, I need the money. How do you make yours? - Pete Vance. (laughing) He sets these dates up for me. - You're pulling my leg. - I'm not pulling your leg, I'm hustling. (laughing) - You took him up on it? - Hey kid, listen, hustling's not so bad. You don't have to do it all the time, just once in awhile. (laughing) Hey listen, I'll give him a call right now. Okay? - Okay. (playful synthesized music) (phone ringing) (gentle vocal music) (phone ringing) - Hello? Yes, Kitty my love. Good work, good work. She'll get my personal attention. An honest to goodness virgin. (laughing) Amazing. Yeah, sure. I have some very special people in mind. Uh huh. Bring her over. - Yup, that's what she said. I'll bring her along, ciao. Well, it's all set. (playful synthesized music) - I don't know. - Hey listen, I'll show you the ropes. - Kitty, I don't know. (upbeat rock music) - Looks like the neighborhood where Mike and I grew up has changed. - Used to be a pretty good neighborhood. Now it's just a dump. - Do you remember the old Bijou Theater? - Oh listen, that closed up a long time ago. - But that was a great place. You know, that was a great theater, you know? And now it's just a fleabag. - It's vacant now, I hear they're gonna tear it down. - So what? It's an eyesore anyway. - It'd make a good place for a, you know, a criminal's hangout. Even your squad team couldn't get out of their garage. - Squad team? Hey, thanks a lot, they're not as bad as that. - [Celia] Hey, wanna dance? - Sure, let's wait til she finishes. - Okay. (upbeat organ music) It's obvious that every one of us is responsible for the existing conditions. - What's the matter, Tony, my tiger? - [Celia] Silence won't help any longer. - Antonio, Antonio! - [Celia] It's time that we take action. - You don't take me anywhere anymore. - Shut up. (Celia talking on TV) - What's wrong? Don't you like your pussy wussy anymore? - [Celia] The time has come - I told you to shut up. - [Celia] where every citizen will take the law into his own hands. If this should happen, we will face chaos. (gentle jazzy music) (police siren blaring) - It's not enough, it's not enough! (sobbing) I need money, I need drugs, Kitty! Kitty? Alright, call him. Oh, you have to promise to be with me, please come with me. Okay, but be with me, okay? (whimpering) (gentle jazzy music) (ominous music) (heavy breathing) (helicopter chopping) (heavy breathing) - No. (whispering and muttering) (mysterious flashback voices) (guns firing) (mysterious flashback voices) (explosion booming) (mysterious flashback voices) (helicopter chopping) - [Man] It's too late, go on. (gasping and grunting) (mysterious flashback voices) (gasping and grunting) (groaning) - Hey, what's going on? - Get out of here, move it! Get out! (gasping) Get out of here, move it! Move it, out! Out, go! Out! (yelling) Now get out of here! Move it out! Go on! Get it! Get out of here! (groaning and grunting) - [Dan] What's going on? Where is everybody? - Go on! - Hey! - Spin it! - [Dan] I'm not carrying anything. - Spin it! (groaning and grunting) (groaning and grunting) (gun firing) (ominous music) (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun clicking) (yelling) (groaning and grunting) (yelling) (groaning) (ominous music) - Dan, Dan, are you alright? (groaning) (glass breaking) (groaning) - Kitty, I don't know if I can go through with this. - Yeah, that's what I said at first, but as soon as the first sleazeball comes along and slips you a 20, it's a breeze! - I think I'm gonna be sick. - Just wait til Pete Vance the pusher man comes along with some dope, you'll see the light. That's Pete's place, go on, go. Hey Pete, here's a new one for ya! (muffled gentle vocal music) - Well, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. (knocking on door) (gentle vocal music) - I have something for you. - What is it? What is it? - Well, let's just call it a peace offering. Friends? (whimpering) - Yeah, that's good. We're gonna have a party. Girls, meet my new chicky. (whimpering) - Don't you think she's a little young? - So? - She's okay. - What's happening, pig? - I'll take care of you. - I'll take care of you, it's okay, quiet. - Who are you? - Quiet. - It's okay. - You jerk. - Leave her alone! - She's all doped up. - [Woman] Give her a break, you bastard! - You're crazy, I'm getting out of here. - Come back here! You let my virgin get away! (grunting) - Ow. - [Pete] Hey, come back here! (gentle jazzy music) (pager beeping) - Phone call. - [Kitty] Laura! - Look, it's not so bad, he just wants a little taste every once in awhile. - Yeah, you don't have to worry about him so much. - It's those creep-os he works for you gotta worry about. - Who? - The tattoo man. - Hey, if he comes near me, I'll waste him. - There's another homicide. - Our guy? - They think so. - Where? - Same area. - Look, take my word for it. I've been around and you can trust me. Right, right? - Huh? - Don't ever, and I mean don't ever get cozy with the tattoo man. - Oh God forbid Pete set you up with the tattoo man. - Are you really that afraid of him? - Twisted bastard, he gets off on pain! - Tortures girls. He gets off watching us squirm. - And scream with pain. - Look, look what he did to me. Look what he did to me! Used to be razorblades, now he uses cigarettes. - What did you submit to this crap for? - Money, I need the money. I got a kid to support. I can't let him go to a county institution. Listen to an old trooper's advice to a little girl. Look, I have to live with this shit, but you don't. So why volunteer yourself? Get out of it while you still can. - Hey listen, Laura's on drugs like the rest of us. (sirens blaring) Once you're on drugs, that's all there is and you're screwed. (sirens blaring) (muffled voices on police radio) - That's it O'Malley, we must get this Executioner! - We're working on it, sir. - It's not enough, the way the media, and I'm referring to our dear friend from KBGTV there, the way they're, she's making him a hero! Making fools of us! - Sir. I'm sorry to interrupt but we found some broken glass. I'm going to check it for prints. - Get it in, then run it through identification. - Finally a break, don't screw it up, O'Malley. (muffled voices on police radio) - [Reporter] The Executioner is still on the loose, and as he continues to commit murder against murderers, the city streets are safe again. The police are after him for breaking the law, and the underworld wants him because he's destroying their organization. Is this Executioner a modern day Superman or a reckless vigilante? Should he be stopped? Or is he expressing the outrage we all feel when we look around and see all the villains in the city? (gentle guitar music) - Well, if it isn't the big police dick. Are you working vice now or just looking for relaxation? - Neither one, I'm looking for some help. - Help? So shall we say this is a social call? - You could say that. - What's in it for me? - I'll owe ya. - Hmm, I like the sound of that. Alright, what do you wanna know? - Anything you have on The Executioner. - I don't have a thing, except that he's brought a lot of heat onto the street, from both the cops and the tattoo man. - The tattoo man? - Yeah, I could tell you plenty about him. - Will it stick in court? - You know him better than that. Word's out anyway, he's looking for The Executioner himself. - Why don't you give Celia Amherst a call? - [Diana] That news dame? - She might be interested in what you've got. KBGTV, it's in the phone book. Be careful what you smoke. - Hi Dad. - Hi, thanks for the cookies. - [Laura] Did you and Mike have a nice time tonight? - It was business but it was okay. - Dad, I have something to tell you. - What is it? - [Laura] Dad, I... - Honey, what's wrong? - I love you very much, good night. - Wait a minute. (phone ringing) (muffled gunfire and music on TV) (phone ringing) Come on Mike, where in the hell are you? (phone ringing) (crowd murmuring) (gentle piano music) - Thank you, Miss Amherst, for accepting my invitation. - It is my pleasure. - Let's hope he sets the news dame up. - The publicity she creates for The Executioner is very unfortunate for our cause. - I like her. - Mr. Commissioner, there is a public outcry against the crime rampant on our streets. - Look at her, now she's getting the better of him. Go powder your nose. - Honey, I just went when we came in. I don't have to go again. - Split. Get rid of the news dame. - Sure boss, I'll take care of it. - Well, shall we talk a little business? - Well of course, but didn't you mention some special entertainment you had planned for me? - Have I ever. (laughing) - Mike, I really should get in here for that tuneup. - You oughta Rog, and you oughta do it now, save yourself the trouble later. - What's wrong with your hand? Let's see. - Oh this? Nothing, I just cut it a little bit. - [Roger] Your hand looks like you crushed a bottle. - Come on, it's nothing, it's just a little cut. How 'bout some tequila. - Hey, I can't man, I'm headed for work. - Come on, your commissioner ain't gonna smell your breath. - Mike, I really can't. (phone ringing) - Gotta go, hang on. (phone ringing) Yeah hi, Mike's place. Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, no German cars, uh huh. Americans only, and no automatic transmissions either. I dunno, you gotta go down the street. I dunno, go down to Sid's place. - Hey gotta go Mike, I'll see you later. - [Mike] Yeah, see ya Rog. - Miss Amherst? - Yes? - I'm Diana. - You got information for me? - About the tattoo man. - Run this through the lab for fingerprints. - [Miller] This glass here? - No, the coffee cup, Miller. (gentle pop music) - Ugh. Hey! (laughing) This seem as bad today as it did last night? (laughing) - (laughing) No. (laughing) I'm sorry, I guess I just lost it. - You sure did. (laughing) Don't feel bad, you should see me, oh, I was that bad or worse. (laughing) - I dunno, maybe I'll try it again sometime. - Maybe sooner than you think. (laughing) Hey, let me tell you, you meet all kinds. - Yeah, I guess. - So what do you wanna do? - Oh, I dunno, I got some great stuff in my house, you wanna go? - You do? - Uh huh. - Let's go! (laughing) - Come on Kitty, hurry up. (gasping) (gasping) - Laura? (grunting and whimpering) (whimpering) (eerie music) - Mike! Mike, save me! - Get Miller in here, and hold all my calls. (heavy breathing) - This Detective O'Malley? Please, it's very important. No, I can't give you my name. Oh, dammit. - Sir, there's no mistake. The fingerprints you found on this liquor glass and the fingerprints we found on the broken beer bottle at the scene of the crime do match. Exactly. - Thank you, Miller. - Is there anything else sir? - That's enough, thank you. - KGBTV. Yes, I must speak with Celia Amherst. Yes, it's very important. Okay, give me the newsroom. Celia Amherst? She's gone for the day? Shit, sorry, um, can you give me her private number? Please, it's very important, please. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. (gentle guitar music) - So, my best friend, the guy who saved my life in Vietnam, turns out to be The Executioner. I'm not bringing him in. - No, no, I don't think you should bring him in. - He is a killer, I'm a police officer. My job is to protect the public from killers. (ominous guitar music) - Keep your eyes open. - Mike, don't give me that crap. The fingerprints match. There's no question you're the man I'm after. - Come on look Rog, you've known me for years. 'Nam made me sick of killing. (ominous guitar music) (dial tone humming) - [Kitty] This is Laura's friend Kitty. Do something, (frantic speaking) Detective O'Malley's daughter was kidnapped! I couldn't stop them! Help! - My God. (Kitty speaking frantically) - I have hard evidence. - [Mike] The enemy. - [Roger] Who's the enemy, Mike? (eerie music) - They are. (helicopter chopping) - [Roger] Who? Who? - Charlie! He's out there, he's waiting. - What are you talking about? That's all over, forgotten. - I haven't forgotten. Who's the enemy, Roger? The orders that sent us to 'Nam, the orders to kill? Or the men behind the orders? They've forgotten, but I haven't. - You're home now, Mike, the war's over. Right or wrong, we served our country. - It's not over. Not as long as crime runs the streets, and orders, they do nothing. And people run scared. I came back but I ain't home. Nobody hung my dog tags on a rotting body bag. I know the enemy. I could taste him. Charlie must die! - [Roger] Search and destroy? - Search and destroy, all the way, Sarge, all the way, all the way, all the way, all the way! - Mike. Mike, it's me, Rog. (heavy breathing) Put it down, Mike. (eerie music) Mike. Mike, go. You've got three hours. (dramatic music) - Mike, Mike listen. They've taken Laura. They took her to, supposedly to 45320 Vincent. Mike! (gasping and whimpering) - Hello, Celia? Hello, Celia? (screaming) (yelling and whimpering) - News lady, you're about to get the wildest interview of your lifetime. (upbeat funky music) (engine sputtering) - Come on, baby! - Time to celebrate. The Executioner will be taken care of shortly. Our commissioner's positive they're going to identify the fingerprints soon and the news dame will meet with a well deserved accident any moment. - [Pete] Mm, brilliant.
