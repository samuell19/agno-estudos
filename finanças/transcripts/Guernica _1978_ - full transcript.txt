Papa, where goes the darkness when sun rises in the morning ? Where it goes? Well, it like that: The Earth rotates constantly, so that sun can shine upon different parts of the world. When there's light, it's dark, on the other side. Light and darkness. It's day and night. All the time. Papa, this uncle is hollow. You didn't know that? Come along. Papa, she doesn't go away, she is only lurking. Papa, who painted that? One great uncle who's not afraid of the dark. Why did he paint it this way? When the Nazis asked him recently, if he painted it, He replied: "No, it wasn't me, this is your work." Roger! I suppose you've watered everything. Perhaps you want to owerflow the flat. -It's time to wake him up. -Maybe it'll be better if you... You've already woke him up. I simply don't know how to exlain such a thing to... a child. If we can only go somewhere, somewhere far away to the country. Get lost. Run away? But where? Do you think there's such a place where man can hide? You should think of Roger. Wake up, Roger. Wake up. So early? Where are we going? Today, you have to wake up earlier. You're not going anywhere. You'll stay home. Why did you take out that fishing coat? Wash up properly. You did your hair strangely. -You're not pretty. -Come on... Where did you rake up these clothes? You'd better clean your teeth. And stop question me. You can't fool anybody. They are only people, too. He is only child. What's that? I thought ribbons are only for girls? It doesn't matter. From now men are going to wear them too. Look here. This ribbon is symbol, of a club I've entered. I enrolled you and your mother too. Now we can be together all the time. I'm going to buy you a yellow baloon and yellow stockings for mummy. Actually we didn't have anything yellow here to this day. Even those frames are either black or violet. Yellow is the colour of the sun, isn't it? But I can't enter that new club. Can't you? None of my friends is a member. But I've already registred you. You don't have to wear it at home, but if anybody rings the bell, put the ribbon on just to be sure. It's trivaial. And on the street? You have to wear it on the street. It's club rule. You can't betray the club. Betrayal is the worst thing. We shoud go, Eric. It's the time. We are Jews. Do you understand? Impure and inferior race. What is it? Why? My nose is too big and crooked. It's big shame nowadays. Tomorrow it'll be big ears and flat feet. Do you remember that uncle who's not afraid of the dark. I remember. Hold on... Female. Wide jaws, cheek bone aberration, with frontal dilatation. Robust hips, moderate spinal deviation. Judging by all signs the origin is Semitic. Your wife already gave birth to a child, didn't she? Do you have a son or a daghter? A son. So your wife lied to us. She said that you're childless. We make a record of this. You can't lie to us Mr. Professor. Lie is a sin. Have a heart for us, he is only child. Jewish child. You have to pay much more for truth. Good morning. Jean-Baptiste Kirchner, musician. What are you looking at? You know doc I like to play Richard Wagner most. Mendelssohn is also good, but Wagner is Wagner. Maybe it'll be better to find something for him in the country. This would be even worse for him. We have to explain it properly. He can't understand it. Why do they want to hale off a children with us? Not everyone has a big nose. It'll be better to take down everyone. Papa, I fixed all the noses. I know. But yours is really big. Run away? It's like that: The Earth rotates constantly, so that sun can shine upon different parts of the world. When there's light, it's dark, on the other side. Light and darkness. It's day and night. All the time. English subtitles: Prasopes
