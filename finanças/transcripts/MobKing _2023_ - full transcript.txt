Come on! Come on! What you doing, man? What you doing, man? Yo, hold up. Take up, take up. That's what I'm talking about. My ball, my. My house, motherfucker. My house. Listen to me. There's no way he's going to do it. What are you worried about? If I was about to get out in the next couple of days, I wouldn't do it either. Just tell him everything. -Here he comes now. -Hey. - How you doing, Tank? - What's good, Mike? My man, Julio. What's up, Julio? So, uh, understand you got a problem. Wanna get smoke? Wanna get smoke, baby? Trash, man. There's this dude, Frankie Cruz. He beat up and raped my 12-year-old little cousin. Trust me, when I tell you I would do the shit myself, if it wasn't for the fact that he was in protective custody. Makes him hard to get to. Fucking ain't right. Hi, Mr. White. Tank will vouch for me. I can get money. Our family back home wants this done. I don't need your money, Julio. Got your callouts here. All set. Excellent. You had me at "raped and beat a 12-year-old," man. Why don't you guys just tell me what this guy looks like, huh? I did you for free, you fucking cocksucker. Dirty fuck. Look, if I got to go down there, what do I need you for? Huh? -Yeah. -What's up, Marco? -How we doing, Pooch? -Looking good, Enzo. - Appreciate it. - Enzo, how are you my friend? - Good. How are you? - Good. I hear Mike White's getting out. -Yeah. -Yeah? -He's finally coming home. -Good, good. I still don't know why the hell you did what you did. I-- I just-- I just-- I'm dumb-- -I'm dumbfounded by it. -Pa. - The guy was talking shit. - So what? Everyone talks shit. That gives you the right to act like a fucking animal? It is what it is, Pop. Jesus fucking Christ. Wha-- what-- what am I gonna do? Big deal, I give him a fucking slap. Carlo, listen to me. When they get here, as of today... they're taking over. They're gonna be working with the chief. Pop. They are taking over the casino. Pop, I've been smoking the peace pipe with these Indian motherfuckers for almost eight years. Pop, you can't take the casino from me. The casino was never yours to begin with! Get that into your fucking head! As I told you before, I discussed it with him and he's willing to work with you during the transition. There's been some serious mishaps leading to bad business. Look, I'll talk to Mike. Okay? All right. Why does he even get a say? Let me explain something to you, okay? Mike White did ten years and kept his fucking mouth shut. He set up a lot of relationships for us and he made us a hell of a lot of money because of that. All these years, I've been the number one earner for this family. Me. Me! Thanks to his play. The fuck does that mean? What, are we in the fucking Twilight Zone? Mike White's off getting pumped full of jizz in the can, all of a sudden he's MVP of the family? Keep your fucking mouth shut! It's Mike White's deal and that is it. What do I get? How about the trucking contract? So, what do you think? The house look different now? Home sweet home. It's a little bigger than I remember. It is. It's been rebuilt, expanded. It's like a whole new house. Hm. Well, I got to give it to you. You always know how to make the best -of every situation, huh? -I picked up a lot from you. Yeah, well, you know, if you said anything else it would be a little unbelievable, right? What's unbelievable is that you're finally here. -Carina. -Dad. What's up, baby? Come. Come on. I thought you were coming in two days. Yeah, no, baby, it's-- it's today, it's been today for a... long time. Here we go. -Look how beautiful. -Wow. Mm! Looks delicious. -All right. -Come on, baby. Sit down. No, not yet. I want to take a picture. Let's go. - Of what, the cake? - Of the cake and the two of you! Ah! - Get closer. - Come, daughter. Let's do this. Get closer. All right, you guys ready? Say cheese. Cheese. Hold on. Let me take another one. Come on, Carina, smile. All right. - There you go. - All right. Aw, look at this one. I'm gonna get it framed, look. -Ah. -You and your baby girl. Who's the grumpy cat in that picture, huh? All right. So happy you're back. Oh, I'm happy to be back. - All right, let's dig in. - Bon appétit. - Bon appétit. See you still cook good. Don't ruin our night, Carina. What did I do? You know exactly what I'm talking about. What's the problem here? Okay, Mom. My stomach really hurts. Can I go lay down in my room? Stomach hurts, stomach hurts. Go lay down. - Thanks, Daddy. - You're welcome. Hey. Baby, relax. Relax, baby. You don't have to eat that fast no more. Take your time. Eating like an animal, huh? Hey. You're home now. -Okay? -Yeah, I gotta get used to that. - Sorry. - It's okay, baby. Come on, baby. You're shaking. I'm nervous. Tell me. Been a long time. Not even sure this thing works anymore. Just relax. You saw how she was tonight? Yeah. Normal teenage shit. Normal. I'm scared. Come on, babe. Scared of what? I mean, she's always been a good kid, right? For the most part. Lately, though... I think she's doing drugs. Come on, we did drugs at 16. What's the big deal? I'm not talking about weed and shit. Okay. All right, I'm gonna go down and talk to her. Look at me. I'm gonna go down and talk to her, all right? Carina. Baby. Carina. Carina? Hey. Hey. Fuck. So? I didn't seen her out there, baby. Damn it. I'm calling the police. We're not gonna call the police, Mia. -Why not? -Come on, use your head. It's my first night home from prison. You think I want to see a yard full of cops? Our daughter has run away. She's probably at a friend's house. And what if she's not? I don't know, I mean, we gotta-- we check the neighborhood or something, like we checked the house. She's not gonna call the cops. Well, what if she comes back and we're gone? -You stay here and I'll go. -No. If you go to her friends' house, I don't think they gonna answer. At least not without a gun. Yeah, uh, probably right about that. I don't know. I don't know. Go. I'll stay here. Okay. - I only take cash. - I can get you cash. I just don't have any on me right now. Come on, Carlos, please, it's me. -No. I can't. -Carlos. Carlos, I'll do anything. Yo, I told you not to get hooked on this shit. Well, just stop stepping on my shit, for real. I keep losing all my little dope fiends 'cause of that. I'm just trying to make money, man. I-- I'll quit tomorrow. I'll tell my parents to put me in rehab and everything, I swear to God, you'll never see me here again, I-- I'll never show up here again. I really-- I really need your help right now, please. I swear to God, I'll bring you your money and everything. -Carlos, please. -We got a gram? Looks like it's not your day today. You have to wait for the real. What do you fucking mean "wait for the real?" What do you guys have in there? -Carlos, your-- -Go home! Carlos, please! Carlos! Fuck! Carina, where have you-- what's going on? Wha-- what's happening? What's the matter? What's the matter? My bones hurt, Dad. Okay. Okay, all right, okay, listen, listen. I'm gonna help you, okay? I'm here. Jeez. When did you get so heavy? All right, so listen. Dealt with this shit my whole life. Okay? You're gonna feel like you wanna die, but you ain't gonna die. Okay? We're going to get you through this. All right? I promise you that much. - It hurts, Daddy. - I know. What's the matter? What're you doing? What are you doing? There's a man downstairs with a gun. Oh, fucking hell. Okay, look. Shh, shh. Get to your room. Come on, come on, stay down. Keep your head down, okay? It's not gonna lock, it's broken. -How do you know? -Because I broke it. For what? For what? This turned into a great first night. Mom. She has a gun in the office. - Right here? - Yeah. We gotta get that gun. Okay. Okay, so this is what we're gonna do. You stay right here. - You don't fucking move. - Okay. Get the fuck out of here right now. What the fuck? Baby, what the hell happened? Somebody took a shot at me. Come here, baby. Are you all right? Are you okay? No, I'm not. Oh, fuck. We need to get this shit cleaned up. Give it to me, baby. Let me see how bad is it. Ah, it's normal, it's fine. - Hang in there, babe. - I'll live. I'll live, let's go. Did you know the guy? Who he works for. That's good enough. Hey, Mike. Welcome home, brother. I need a cleaner. -Where? -My house. Also need a medic. I'll handle it. Mom. Mom, Mom! Hey. Hey, Mike. Mike. Didn't you always say that if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself. Hey, guys, he's waking up. Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike,. Relax, Mike. Relax. We're gonna fix you up. -Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike. -Where the fuck? My name is Donna and I'm here to do the fixing up. Do you understand what I'm saying? -Yeah, yeah. -Perfect. Now, I need you to just relax. Okay. You're doing great, Mike. Now, I'm gonna just take a look, okay? Relax, Mike. Come on. Come on. Come on, baby. They did a pretty good job on him, huh? You and Carina okay? What? No. No, we're not okay. Don't you see this shit? The fucker was in our house. Mikey. Who was it? Romo. Romo? - Who works for Carlo? - Yeah. Are you absolutely sure? I put him in the ground. What was the point of Mike keeping his mouth shut, huh? All those years away from his family. For what? So that when we need real protection, it's all blank stares? I thought the family was supposed to look out -for one another. -I would die for Mike. And Enzo and all of these guys. But this is uncharted territory. So, what are we supposed to do now? -I-- I don't know. -You what? I have to think about it. Are we on our own? I gathered as many guns as I could. I'll figure this shit out. - Hi. - Hello. - Nice plants. - Oh, thank you. It's a gardenia. Lot of people don't know this, but it's actually -part of the coffee family. -Wow. Yeah, bet you didn't know you were gonna be getting shrub fun facts from me today. - You must be Mia. - I am. - Randy. - Pleasure. - Ah, oh, hello! - That's my teenager. - Teenager? - I can't get her to move. - She's basically cement. - Teenage girls. - It's like sweet alyssum, right? - Oh. That's a fragrant wildflower. Gardeners will plant that - to bring in the pollinators. - Okay. Anyways, what we should do is check out the house because if not, I will have you out here all day. Yeah. What's he look like? Kinda-- I don't know. Goofy? Yeah, so when she told me I couldn't have bacon in the morning anymore, I was like, "Nuh-uh, we're done." So, uh, you got any more people coming out? You know, we get a lot of family gatherings around here. There is a beautiful, beautiful lake just right down the road, and it's stuffed with peacock bass. Everybody loves the fishing. Um, right now it's just my daughter and I. Maybe later. - Okay, okay, I see, I get it. - Yeah? - Right? - Yeah. I know you, I see that smile, yeah. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, there's a Mexican place -just right down the road. -Okay. They have, like, an awesome club night. We're talking sometimes foam, they fog it up, lasers through, it is-- - Wow. - It's my heaven. It's my heaven. But any who, I know you've got a lot of unpacking to do. -Yeah. -So, I'm gonna let you do that. I'm gonna gather up my stuff here, - and, uh, you got my number. - I do. If you need anything, just call me. - Thank you. - No problemo! Mike, you're almost there. - Yeah. - Here you go. Slowly. Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, fuck me. Try to turn slowly. -Get-- get-- get a pair-- -Mom. Baby? Please. If I-- if I die-- if I die, or if it gets too much, then you run. You guys run, okay? Mike, you're gonna be okay. You just need to rest. -Fuck. -You're gonna be okay, okay? Just relax, baby. Nice bike you got yourself there. What's got you out here roaming around so late? Everything okay? I need to-- I have to get some medicine. Medicine? There's nothing 24 hours open around here. The pharmacy in town doesn't open 'til morning. My buddy, Doug, will take good care of you. Is he a gangster? Dougie? No. He's pretty harmless. Just a good dude who knows how to party. Here you go. All right, and when you wanna go back home, just go back through the entrance, go right, just keep going 'til you hit the house. -Got it? -Got it, Mister. Come on. I'm not that much older than you. Just call me Randy. - Talking shit. - Ask proof. I'll make some calls, okay? Krista said she was pregnant, said it was my baby, I should have kicked her in the stomach, you understand? And then-- then a man Oh, that's my girl. No, no. Looks like the city girl got lost. I'm not lost. I'm supposed to meet Doug. You're looking at him. So, what do you need? Classic. My all time favorite. - How much is this? - 250. Really, because back home, my-- You know how hard it is to get the shit that I got around here, huh? You're right. I'm sorry. I'm visiting you. You're the boss here. So, um, what else you have? All right. See, now we're talking. I got oxys, roxys, xannies, addies, meth. I got an eight ball of coke, molly and some exotics. Which you in the mood for? How do you like to party? I like starting with the molly, then some exotics. You ever try whippets when you're on molly? Fuck. -Fucking bitch. -Let go of me. You're gonna rip me off, huh? Give my shit. I don't have it. Get the fuck off me! Oh, you didn't have my shit, right? You fucked up, you stupid little bitch. So, that what you wanna do, huh? You wanna get high? What do you got on this, motherfucker? Mike. Hm? Babe. Let me tell you something. If I ever see you there again, you're gonna wish I killed you real fucking fast, you understand me? Now, get the fuck outta here. Move real slow. This is what you risked our lives for? - It's not-- - Are you that hooked -on this shit? -I got it for him! This is a fucking mess. Carlo can't just fucking go after one of our guys like this. We don't know if the Don ordered this himself or not. You know the Don's not buying this. We keep our mouth shut and see how things play out. How's the kick on that? - Not too harsh. - See that 45. - You ready? You're next. - I'll pass. Why? -I don't want to. -Hey. This might be a good time to talk. About what a fuck up I am? No thanks. Carina, you're obviously hurting. If I shot a man and buried it with my mom, I'd at least want to talk about it. What do you want me to say? That I'm happy that I murdered someone? You saved my life. - You did. - Twice. I wouldn't even be able to move around like this if it wasn't for those pills. You know what? You didn't murder anybody. You killed someone who was trying to kill your father. What's the difference? Carina. There's a huge difference between killing someone to protect versus cold blooded murder. You don't know what it feels like. - I do. - Of course you do. You probably came out of the womb doing hits. Actually, I wasn't much older than you. How'd it happen? I used to work for some wise guys, you know? Yes. Yes, good, good. Parking cars run around stuff. - Get some extra cash. - phone. How many times do I gotta tell you? I was about 14, you know? Hey, don't forget, we gotta go. Couple of years later, I got my license. One of the perks of working for these type of guys is they let me drive all their cool cars, you know? The Cadillacs, Camaros, Corvettes, you name it. Just like that, driving back to the old hood, past my friends and their rust buckets. Just gliding on through. The time of my life. Thought I was on top of the world. That I was grown. Then, April 14th rolled around. It kinda started out like a normal day, you know, the Don and the driver, Freddie, pulled up. There's a change of plans, kid. I need you to handle this for me. Take this, too, in case you need it. I was ecstatic. My number came in. Don's gonna know my name. Come on, kid, let's go. Hop in the car. Driving the Don. Next thing you know... I think someone might be tailing us, kid. Think you could lose him? Come on, you got it in you. Zig-zagging here and there. Couple of lefts here. Before you know it, I don't see nothing. That's pretty damn good driving there, kid. And out of nowhere... a red car comes, almost rams right into us. Shit. Big old fucking guy gets out of the car. All I see is a gun in his hand. Next thing I know is emptying a .38 in this guy's chest. Get me the fuck out of here, kid. He was gone. First, I was worried about the cops, you know? Shit was all over the news. Expected them to kick the door down any minute. Never happened, though. And for months... the stuff play in my head. Over and over and over again. Make my stomach churn. Other days, I'd be barfing like some animal. But I knew. I knew I did what was right, what I was supposed to do. That's what you did. What you did for me. I'm living proof. It's like with anything. Time kicks in, you start to make peace with it. You're going to make peace with it. So now, what I need you to do is learn how to shoot that shotgun. 'Cause in a split second, we can't be wondering whether or not you're gonna figure out how to use it. All we got right now is us. That's it. We gotta be ready. Fuck yeah, bitch. Why didn't you kill him yourself? pussy. Shut up, bitch. Carina, I'm on the phone with your father and I can't hear anything, Carina. -Anything. -I don't even sound like that. - You do. - Sounds about right. Keep going. -Oh, there's this one time. -Oh, there's more? -Oh, okay. -Keep going. C'mon. Keep going. Why is Barbie stuck in one of my Louboutin's? We also-- Who the fuck? Stay-- stay calm, okay? I'll go check. Go back, over there. Over there. Hey, what's going on? It's, like, ten o'clock. Yeah, and I'm sorry, it's just-- I totally forgot to mention, the pipes in this structure are kind of weird, so, sometimes, that hallway toilet tends to overflow. If I could just check it out real quick, make sure it's flushing properly. I mean, we haven't have any problems. It's been working fine. Believe me, I want to keep it that way. Okay, so you wanna-- you wanna check out -the bathroom, right now? -Yeah. -Yeah, um-- -Just a quick few flushes and I'll be out here. - All right. - Oh, shit, I'm so sorry. I was fiddling with the water outside a bit, and-- if-- if you get a mop, I can clean this up. No-- no, you know what? Um, we'll take care of it. -Don't worry about it. -Are you sure? Yeah, just go do your thing. We'll clean it, okay? Okay. Hi. Okay, well, it should be good for at least 24 hours, hopefully. It's crazy to think that, like, simple minerals, you know, like, calcium and iron can cause such a buildup like that. But I was talking to a guy the other day and he was telling me about this white vinegar rinse -and, uh, suppose-- -Thank you so much, Randy. -Have a great night. -Oh. Oh, you, too. Good night. - Gone? - Yeah. There's something really wrong with that fucking guy. Dad, are you gonna eat? I messed up. I got way too comfortable. Took all of this for granted. Wish I never left you guys. I just wanted to be able to tell you guys that I'm sorry. It's something I wanted to do forever, you know? It's okay, Dad. I forgive you. Well. There's something else I'm sorry about too. I'm letting this food get cold. I like that. I like her hair. I don't know what it is. You like her hairstyle, that's what it is, this one. - She's got a nice. - Oh, yeah. -Carlo, your father's here. -Nice, strong stomach. Don't you answer your phone? Pop. Don't worry about that. Look, look at these broads. They're trying out for the casino shop. -Put this shit away. -Pop. Someone's been opening their mouth. I am gonna be indicted any minute. Pop, it's probably that prick, Mike White. He's been gone for months. Mike's been gone? Who else has been gone? Nobody's seen Romo. Romo's been in Vegas. Pooch, tell him. I heard the hookers are running from him. I bet they are. That guy's an animal. I don't know who this rat is, but I want you to find him. Sure thing, Pop. Hey, Don. What? I don't even know how to tell you this, Don. What? They're all fucking lying to you. Romo's dead. Shut up. What the fuck do you want? Please. Oh, what I want? I got what I want. No! - You got everything? - Yeah. Hey, babe. Did you get some rest? I guess you can call it that. Oh, this is kinda cute. God knows what's in here. Oh, this is good. Hey, hey. What's up, Mike? Yeah, he's a little tied up right now. All right, let me-- let me go get him, hold on. Come in. You gotta take this call. All right. All right. Oof. -Hello. -What's up, Vet? It's Mike. Hey, Mike, how you doing man? Just here trying to figure out my next move, you know? Yeah, I hear you. It's fucking crazy here, too. Carlo is acting like nothing happened. You know, I'm getting the feeling that, uh, I might be next on his list. Yeah. So, did you tell him? What am I gonna tell the guy? He's got an indictment over his head. And, uh, when does he give a shit about anything? Why don't you tell me what the fuck that means? What does it mean? It's out of our hands. And all the fucking money that we made for his family. Yeah, listen to me, Vet. -Don trusts you. -Hey, you can go on the run. You know, I'm married. I married the old man's sister. -So I'm here, I'm stuck here -Well. putting up with this crap. It is what it is, I guess. I don't think I'll be coming back anyway. Uh-huh. You know, maybe Carlo will, uh, you know, rat me out to the feds. Yeah, you should be so lucky. Anyway, listen, you take care with your girls if you need anything. I'm just, you know, a phone call away, anytime. Yeah. Do you really think he's gonna keep looking for you after this? I mean, think about it. If you're done and gone, then you're not a threat anymore, so what's the point? It's hard to say. You know, I've been thinking about Vermont. Think about it. In a place where you don't have to worry about locking doors at night. Somewhere where we don't have to worry about Carina living too fast. Where everybody knows each other. And everybody knows your business. Yeah, but I'm thinking about a community where everybody has each other's backs. Plus, it would help keep an eye on Carina. Yeah. Oh, it was so fucking hard when you weren't here. Don't you think this shit with Romo is getting a little out of hand? Mike White. He got away with killing Romo. And nobody did a fucking thing about it. You two. I need the both of you to hunt down this motherfucker Mike White and I want you to make him disappear. He's gonna be a real pain in the ass to kill. Yeah, like chasing a ghost in a house full of mirrors. If I hear one of you say another nice thing about that fucking Mike White, I'm gonna put a bullet in your fucking heads. Now, go make a ghost out of him. Get the fuck out of here. What are you waiting for? Spoke with one victim who was ripped off by a conner who was posing as a friend. ...and a friend, asked her to use the Cash App and buy just $200 in... - All right. Let me see. - What did you see? I've seen nothing, but I heard something, so-- We're gonna go into this room, okay? Let's go. All right. Go, go, go. Go, go, go, go. This might be it, all right? I can't see a fucking thing. - Fuck. All right. - What is it? Yeah, there's somebody out there for sure. Now, let's just handle this, okay? Let's get ready. It's Randy. What the fuck? I swear to God. We kill this fat fuck. -Hey, Randy. What's up? -Hey. I was just checking in on you two. There's been power outages all around town and I know that that cable box in the master bedroom has a hard time flipping back on when the power goes out. If you'd be a doll and just check that out for me. Uh, like, right now? -All right, hang on. One sec. -Yeah, yeah, no problem. Hey. How's it going? I got more. You want some? No? You sure? - I'm sure. - I got plenty. You really are like a fragrant wild flower. You smell really good. Makes me curious to know what your pussy tastes like. Call 911. Call 911. Who the fuck are you? Mike, stop. Who the fuck is you? Who the fuck are you? Mom? Mike. What's on the phone? No. No. No, don't. No. No, no, no, no, no. - Help! No, no, no. - Please, don't. No. Fuck you. Fuck you. You fucking pervert. Fuck you! Hey. You know what? I have to... tell you something. I should have raped your fucking daughter when I had the chance. All clear. You sure you checked every drawer? -Yep. -All right. Let's get the hell out of here. There we go, now. Guys, pull around the side. You're absolutely sure you feel safe? Gotta make sure this can't come back to us. You know? You-- you're not coming? Sweetheart, I can't. I'm just so scared that I'm not going to see you again. Don't be silly, all right? I'm going to be right behind you, okay? You're going to go with your mom right now. You guys are going to go to a hotel and I'll be there as soon as I can. -I love you. -Love you, too. Bill. -Hey. -Hey. Long time, man. It's gotta be 15 years, brother. Ah. Created a real mess for you in there. Oh, don't worry. Packed my wetsuit and my snorkel. Let's do this. No anger management in prison? At least he didn't suffer. I still haven't heard one good reason, not one good reason, why this thing of ours isn't strictly Sicilian? Come on, Enzo, you're starting to sound like Masseria. He wanted everything Sicilian, everything Italian, cost him his life. You want to help me out? Maybe explain it to him? Well, it's pretty simple really. Guys like Luciano and Ricardo, they understood the value of a diverse organization. You know, putting the importance on the actual... person instead of the nationality. You know, Luciano had Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel. Bugsy Siegel, Bugsy Siegel. A wise guy Jew in the Sicilian Mafia. I mean, it was he and Luciano who founded Murder Inc. You thought everyone that was made was Sicilian. Now, you know. I mean, it's the greatest sleight of hand, the greatest magic trick that's ever been pulled, this whole thing about them being Sicilian. You look at the-- the heads. The mob bosses, most of them, they weren't Sicilian, right? Capone? Anastasia. Genovese. - Costello. - Costello. Up to this very day, the list continues. You know, Mike, it's hard for me to believe. This is the last time we're gonna do dirt together. I gotta protect my family, man. Stuff my daughter seen last couple months, everything I put her through. Need a different change of pace, man. I just think this whole situation, it just could have been handled, I don't know... just different. You followed all the rules, Mike. You did all that time in the joint. You've always been a stand-up guy. And above board. I mean, I can't go after the Don's son. Since when? Guess since I decided to be a better... husband and father, man. That's my point. You see, in my book, you want to be a better husband? You want to be a better father? Then you get them back the life that you and me have worked so hard for. Not just stand around here and let Carlo take it away from you. You didn't break the rules, Mike. He did. History channel. What would the old timers do in a situation like this? The old Dons? The old Dons would never let a violation like this go unpunished. And he knows that. Don don't got a beef with Mike. None of his crew do. It's Carlo. Carlo and his small time soldiers. If I was you... ...I'd call Vetti for a sit down with the Don before he's gone. Mom, can you pass me the chips? - Which one? - The blue. Thank you. Mom? Anything from Dad? -Uncle Mike. -Anthony. Mike, how are you? Long time. Find what I was looking for? I did. And? It was there. I'm gonna talk to Mike alone for a minute. Mike. Sit down, Mike. You heard the bad news. The indictment? Cock sucking feds. Had my office, house, bugged for months. It's bad enough I got every asshole in this town wanting me dead, now I gotta deal with this shit. How bad is it? Very bad. I know why you're here. I know you know it was Carlo. I do. Look. I think the best thing that we could do is get everybody in a room, talk about this and figure out how-- Don. There ain't nothing to talk about here. He's my son. He's out of control. It's not the first time. It's not the second. This time, he went too far. My daughter watched me get gutted with a knife. She saved my life by blowing the brains of that cocksucker, Romo, all over the floors that she learned to walk on. You know what you're asking me to do? I'm not asking you to do anything. We made an oath. You know what that means. We live by it, we work by it and not anything or anyone can break it. You... You taught me that. Fucking kid. It's crazy. This fucking kid is crazy. You know what to do. Ain't nothing for you to do, Don. He's got to go, man. I'm going away for a long time. Thought about this-- this... There's no way in hell I can let this kid just take over everything. After what my family bled for. I gotta do what I gotta do. And you gotta do what you gotta do. I don't wanna know when and I don't wanna know how. Okay, Don. Okay. You see that shit? Sucks. I love it. Let's go. - Yeah, sure it is. - Yeah. Look at this. Look at this. What a game. Let's go, baby. Come on, come on, come on. What the fuck? Yeah? Hm. Guys, I gotta take this outside. Of course you do. Hm. We know you're trying to run. My whole team spanking that ass. Should have picked a better running back, pal. Baby, baby. Relax, sweetheart. What's the problem? I'm with the guys. You know what? Go get the King George. We're fucking celebrating tonight. -You got it. -Yeah. Hey, Marco. Where the hell are you? Come on, man, the game's almost over and C wants to crack open some George. Well, there you are. What the fuck? Where you at, motherfucker? What the fuck was that? What's happening? - Not now! - Carlo! Carlo, what is happening? Carlo, don't leave me. Hey. You want to? Motherfucker. Fuck you. Fuck you! Fuck. Ah. Fuck. Now, it's my turn. Are you fucking kidding me? Why won't you die? Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Where the fuck you guys been? Fuck. This asshole killed Paulie and Marco. And my girl. Killed my fucking girl. Looks like you seen better days. Oh, the fuck is this, a fucking reunion? Where we at? A campground? Gonna sing songs next? - The fuck? - Carlo, Carlo. -What? -Your father's been arrested. What? When? -A short while ago. -What the-- -Did you call a lawyer? -I called a lawyer. Great. It makes me-- That makes me the don. Wait a minute. That makes me the fucking Don, right? I've been meaning to talk to you about it. Yeah. Welcome home. Vet, how are you doing? -How are you? -Great. Great to see you. Gentlemen. This certainly is a special night to all of us, but it's even more special to me. I wanna thank you all for such a prosperous year. So, let's toast. Salute. I'm really tired. Still got a couple things I gotta handle. I want you guys out of 'em, okay? You always got things to handle. These people are unreal. Fuck this shit. If that Richard Fellari would have called me "sweetie" one more goddamn time, I would have spit on his fucking Caesar salad. - Have we got something good? - Yeah. Looks like your boy, Mike White's back in business. That explains the bodies popping up everywhere. Changing of the guard. My buddy, Mike White, rides smack in the middle, just like I've been saying all along. You know that trucking contract should have been settled years ago. But now that it's in my hands, things are going to be okay. Yeah, Vet. We know how decisive you could be. Ha-ha. Funny. But no offence against Dominic. You know, things are going to be more smooth now. It's too bad what happened to Carlo. He was a good earner. You know, about that. I'm sorry, Vet. Sorry? What are you sorry about? Dominic's orders. It's dirty business.
