-[grunts] -[gasps] I am so sorry, that was all my fault. Are you okay? -Yeah. I am now. -Hi. -Hi. You might?ve burned down your bridges Might?ve lost sight of your vision Had to hold your head down when you couldn?t hold onto faith While this world keeps on spinning It?s like you?re only worth what you?re winning And you can?t find your place You don?t have to have it all to have something to live for Haven?t I, haven?t I, haven?t I, haven?t I told you? You?re gonna face the wall If taking chances was easy then you?d never fall Haven?t I, haven?t I, haven?t I, haven?t I told you? That it's worth it all Just give it everything, don't give up You'll be standing tall It was worth it -Am I overreacting or did the earth just move? -It could?ve been the kiss or it could be the setting. -I don?t know what you see in this place. -I see us. -They should put up a plaque. -There?s our bench. -I was late but I sat there for two hours. -Nearly three. -You were reading an Emily Bronte novel. -Jane Austen. -Little did I know, when I went for that run... I?d end up in love. -So, I was thinking... Adam. -Yeah, you gonna tell me the thought or am I supposed to guess? -You should come to Shabbat dinner and get to know my family. -Oh yes. -[giggling] -That?s big, that?s a big step. -I am aware. So? -So, I thought you?d never ask. I haven?t been to a Shabbat dinner in a long time. I barely remember the blessing. So your parents won?t hold it against me? -Not if you?re good to their daughter. -What should I bring? Wine, flowers, a new car? I want them to like me. -Go with the car. -Yeah? -Yeah. -Like a hybrid or like...? -[Rebecca] Mom, I can?t wait for you to meet him. Adam?s smart and funny but he also has a really kind heart. And he?s even good looking, and by that I mean gorgeous, or at least I think so. -Don?t hold back. How do you really feel? -I can?t help it, I?m in love. -You?re such a romantic. -Stop telling her how to feel, let me do that. -When you know you know. -What do you know exactly? -He?s the one. -Whoa. -[gasps] -And he?s coming to dinner on Friday. -Oh! -I get to meet him. -Love me, love my family. Even my overly protective sister, Hannah. -And I know this is so cheesy but my heart still races every time he walks into a room. -I know it?s only been six months but do you think he might propose? -Oh. -I?m certainly open to the possibility but I?m not expecting anything. -Yeah. -I mean, if he asked I would probably say yes. If and when the moment came, but who knows. You know? -That is the most complicated I hope so I have ever heard. [cookie crunches] -No, no, no. It?s not that I don?t like the font, I hate it. I don?t wanna see it anywhere in the building. One second. Hey guys, we need to put the dog food pitch on hold and anything else you?re working on. We need to land the Body Now account. -We?re already on it. -Are you? Then why are you still talking to me? [laughs] I?m kidding. -[laughing sarcastically] -But I?m not really kidding. Okay? Seriously, do not let me down on this. Yeah, I?m back. Where are we? -Okay. Uh, they are opening up 22 of these places on the west coast. The artwork looks pretty easy. It?s, well, beautiful people we all wanna be, looking way better than we ever could. Uh... wow. This is so much more than an ordinary gym. This is a health nut's paradise. It's a medi spa. Cryotherapy? Uh... Oh, juice bar! I mean, who would willfully drink chlorella? Feel free to chime in any time, Adam. -Chlorella? -Yeah. -Nick, sorry. Uh... where were we? -Uh, never mind where I was. Where were you? -[sighs] I?m in love. Which is a wonderful, nerve-racking, terrifying place to be. Did you know that Rebecca means a woman who steals a man?s heart? Do you know that? -I did not know that. -It does. -Oh. -She did. -[Peter] Well, make it for first class... What?s wrong? Why the happy face? -Oh. Uh, we think we have a beat on the Body Now account. -Yeah. -Good! Because I just booked a meeting with the client. -Great. -Perfect. -That is... great. -[clears throat] -Good, good. -Great. -Good, good. -Uh oh. -That is so great. Hmm. -Deep, deep breaths. [hyperventilating] Ahhhh! -Treadmill? -Treadmill. -I know that look. -Yeah. [panting] What? I?ve got too much going on on too many fronts. I need to dissipate my cortisol. Ah, that?s the stuff. [school bell rings] -Oh, beautiful. -I talked to the Board. There?s nothing more in the budget for supplies. -That?s okay. We?ll go to the discount store and buy them ourselves. -You wanna go this afternoon? -Hmm, I?m making challah with my mom. Adam?s coming for dinner. -Miss Singer has a boyfriend! [both laughing] Dinner with the family is big. [school bell rings] -Yeah. -I gotta get to my office. We?ll hit the discount stores next week? -Sure. -So... you have a boyfriend? -I do. -Hmm. What is holler? -Holler? -Yeah. That thing you?re making with your mom. -Oh. Challah. It?s a special kind of bread. -Well, what?s so special about it? -It?s filled with happy memories. -Cool. -Shall we? -Okay. -Okay. -[Sadie] I remember making challah with my mother. Every ingredient came with a blessing. She would always say... [in unison] Food is love you can taste. [both laughing] -I miss Nana so much. -You have her smile and her kind eyes. One day you?ll make challah with your daughter. -Or son. -I can?t wait to have grandkids. -You have one on the way. -I could use a few more. [both laughing] Adam is a lucky man. -Because of the challah? -Because of the girl who made it for him. -You look beautiful. -Thanks Dad. -And you?re even more beautiful on the inside. If your Adam is wise, he?ll value that more. -Well, he isn?t my Adam. Not yet. -Well... I give him 'till about half past dessert. -[chuckles] -[Hannah] Hello! Ooh, something smells amazing. Ooh. -Is he here yet? -No. Ah, ah, ah, ah. -I have a lot riding on this. If this guy sticks, we are gonna be watching ball games together for the next 40 years. He better be a Cubs fan. -He is. -Our kids are gonna be cousins. These things matter. -Hey, this is a dinner, not a wedding. -Isn?t that a new dress? -Hmm, to go with the new hair. It?s cute, I like it. -Look, this is Adam?s first time meeting my family and I would appreciate it if you didn?t scare him off. Okay? -It?s not like I am going to ask his intentions. -Of course not. I will. [doorbell rings] -That must be him. -Ooh, he?s punctual. That?s a good sign! -How do I look? [both grinning] -I?ll get it. You must be Adam. -Uh, yes. Yes, I am. -Come in. -[chuckles] -Now would be a good time. -Good. Great. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Singer. -Please, call me Jacob. -Alright. Thank you, Jacob. Mrs. Singer? -Sadie. -Sadie. Uh, well I haven?t been to a Shabbat dinner in a really long time so I brought a little of everything. -Thank you. -Some flowers for you. -They?re beautiful. -Okay, and I hope you like chocolate. -We do. -Oh my. -Yeah, it's a lot. I know. Um... I wanted to make a good impression. -Well, consider me impressed. I buy the honesty. -This is my sister, Hannah. -Hello. -Hi, nice to meet you. -And her husband Elliot. -Hey. -It?s customary on Shabbat to give the sister?s husband tickets to a Cubs game. -Ah, I see. I see. This is a tradition I?m not familiar with. But, uh, next time. I promise. -Oh, you?re assuming there?s gonna be a next time? -Oh, I?m just hoping out loud. [chuckles] -I like that. -Thanks. -What?d you get? -Michael Friedman bar mitzvah. -Canner Zuckerman wedding. -Oh, it?s a shame that didn?t work out. -Yeah. -Would you like to do the honors? -Sure. -Oh. -[reciting blessing in Hebrew] -Amen. -Amen. -[singing blessing in Hebrew] [all singing blessing in Hebrew] Amen. L?chaim. -L?chaim. -L?chaim. [all toasting together] [glasses clinking] -Eyes. Eyes. -I?m doing eyes. -[glasses clinking] -[chuckling] -To health. [glasses clink] -To happiness. -Everyone... [all singing blessing in Hebrew] Amen. -Shabbat shalom. -[all together] Shabbat shalom. -Would you like to do the honors? -Sure. -Whoa, save some for the rest of us. -He?s kidding. -[chuckles] -But not about the Cubs tickets. -Oh. Oh man. You made this? -Yeah. My mom and me. -So if we were together, I would get this every Friday night? -How together are we talking? -As together as it gets. -Wait ?till you try her brisket. He fits in really well. -What does he think about kids? -You think I?d get involved with someone who didn?t like kids? -Pardon me for asking. -He?s pretty perfect if you haven?t noticed. And every single day I fall deeper in love. He?s right behind me, isn?t he? -He came to see if you needed help. Now he?s backing away, having heard nothing. -[chuckling] He?s a helper, that?s a good sign. -And he?s funny, which is even better. -He?s a keeper. [all laughing] -This is the best Shabbat dinner I can remember. My dad passed away when I was four. My mom had to work full time. And then she married a man who wasn?t Jewish, from Vermont, which is where we lived until they divorced. Somehow my Jewish heritage got a bit lost along the way. -Maybe it?s time for you to reclaim it. -Yeah. Maybe so. -How did you end up in Chicago? -I went to Northwestern. -Oh. -Go wildcats. -Go wildcats. [chuckles] And after graduation I decided to stick around. -How?d you get into advertising? -Well, I went to business school but what I really loved to do was write. Advertising was my compromise between the two. -Enough with the questions, let the man eat. -I don?t mind. [laughs] -Sadie has to have the last word. -It?s in the ketubah, you signed it. -It?s a marriage contract that Jewish couples sign. -It says that we will listen to each other and hear each other. But Sadie likes to be heard last. -I have a lot to say. -See what I mean? -He sees and he hears, enough said. -"I?ll have what they?re having." -When Harry Met Sally. -Boom, you got it. [mugs clack] -Nailed it. [phone ringing] Hey! -Hi sweetheart. -Where are you? -I?m in Tuscany. We started demo on the villa. I got your text. What did you wanna talk to me about? -Call me when the walls aren?t coming down. I have some good news. [crashing] -[yelling in Italian] My Italian is atrocious but somehow, if you say it with conviction, things get done. -Alright, we?ll talk tonight. Ciao! -Okay. Ciao sweetheart. Muah! -Who are you yelling at? -My mom. -Oh. -She?s in Italy renovating a villa for some opera singer. -Your mother is a force of nature. -Alright, let?s talk Body Now. We pitch three 30 second spots. A guy is working out on some high tech contraption. A girl is in the spa getting a facial. -Okay. -They meet at the juice bar. Uh oh. There?s an instant attraction. Second spot. He gets buffer, she gets cleaner pores and the relationship deepens over a green drink. And in the last spot they?re unbearably fit and falling in love. Now, pumping iron and exfoliating are not inherently engaging. So, we give the commercials... a romantic spin. -Yeah. I?m sorry buddy, I don?t get it. -That?s because you?re not in love. -Oh. Yeah, right. This is about Rebecca. -Well, everything is about Rebecca but that doesn?t mean my idea won?t work. There?s a reason romance sells. We?re all looking for love. A few of us find it. I did. I?m asking Becs to marry me. -There it is. I knew it. I?m not surprised. -You?re not? -Adam, you?ve been telling me you?re gonna marry this girl from the day that you met her. -[laughs] -So, look. You?re gonna need a ring to seal the deal and I, I know, I am a three time loser in that department but that much I know. -I mean, you were only married once. -When it comes to rings, I count my engagements. [Nick chuckles] -[Rebecca] Pizza, an art show and now... the most beautiful place in Chicago. -But wait... there's more. -Okay, I don?t know how you top this. -Okay. You know that I love you. I just hope you know how much. -I love you too. [gasps] [both laughing] -How did you do this? -I called the parks department, they let me sponsor a bench. -I feel like I went to sleep and woke up in a Jane Austen novel. [giggles] -But wait. There?s more. -[gasps] Adam. -You haven?t seen the ring yet. -The box may be all I can handle. -Will you marry me? -Yes. -Can you just repeat that, just one more time? -[laughing] Yes, I will marry you! I can?t wait to tell my parents. -My mom is in Italy but she?ll be here next week. They?ll get to meet. -What is she like? -She... -She?s an acquired taste. -What does that mean? -Very opinionated. -Ah! Well my mom?s opinionated too. -Oh, so they have something in common. What could possibly go wrong? -What? Why would you say that? They can?t wait to meet you. Listen, they?re very down to Earth. -I can do down to Earth. -Mom, I love you, but you?re in designer head to toe. -I wanted to look my best. [knocking] -Rebecca, this is my mom, Diane. -Hello Rebecca. -Hi. Hi! Um, come on in. [all chuckling] -Hi. -Hi. -[Diane] What a lovely home. -Let?s pick a date and move backwards from there. -I?m having knee surgery in September. -I have to be in the UK in October. I?m renovating a castle in Scotland. -Maybe during your summer break? -Mmhmm. -Well, the synagogue is booked months in advance. -Well, maybe we could do it at the Regency Hotel. I designed their lobby, I?m sure I can pull a few strings. -I always dreamed of having a traditional Jewish wedding in a synagogue. -Why don?t I call Rabbi Solomon and see if there?s a cancellation? Hmm? Uh-huh. Uh-uh. [gasps] Oh... I... I'm sorry to hear they broke up. But he was never right for her. June 17th? Oh, that doesn?t give us much time. Yes, Rabbi. We?ll take it. I can't believe it. It?s a miracle, meant to be. There?s an opening on June 17th. -[Diane] June 17th! -Well, that?s two months away. -Seven weeks actually. -The miracle will be planning a wedding that quickly. We need a list. -I?m a list maker too. Number one on the list, meet with the rabbi. You have an appointment on Monday at 4:00PM. -Monday. -Number two is the dress. -My cousin has a bridal salon. -The flowers, invitations... -The cake, the chuppah. -Uh, the... the ketubah. The wedding contract, that is the most important thing on the list. -Where do I sign? -Well, my father passed away when I was really young. I remember him saying the Shabbat blessings. I remember him playing dreidel with me at Hanukkah. But that?s pretty much it. -Well perhaps the traditions of a Jewish wedding might make you feel closer to him. -And we wanna blend the old with the new and create traditions of our own. So the marriage contract, of course. And, uh, circling, but we?re both gonna do that. -That?s modifying an older tradition but it?s your wedding. -Yeah. And the wine, the rings and... oh, Adam's gonna break the glass. -You good with all this? -I?m good with her, the rest I can learn. -Well it?s good to have you both learn more about each other. I like to have couples take a little test. -Well, we?re here, we?re getting married. -Um... I think we're good. We love each other, we know each other. So... -I think we know each other pretty well. -Does everyone say that? -They do. It?s very simple. Twenty questions, how you see yourselves, how you see one another. And it?s more revealing than you might think. -Okay. -Thank you. [playful music] -Did we pass? [chuckles] Kidding. How did we do? -Well... you both have a lot in common. Your mutual love of movies and novels. But you seem to view each other somewhat differently. -What do you mean? -You tend to feel that Adam gets a little nervous at times. -Nervous? When do I get nervous? -You were nervous meeting my parents. -Well... -I mean, you?re nervous at work. You have a treadmill in your office. -If you had my boss you?d need one too. -I report to a higher authority but I get what you mean. -Of course. -Okay. Now, here is a question worth discussing. Is your partner a good listener? You seem to disagree. -You?re more of a talker. -Well I think I?m a good listener. That doesn?t mean I?m not listening. -You can?t really listen when you?re talking. -Clearly you both have a lot to discuss. But not simultaneously. And that?s the point of taking the test. When you sign the ketubah, you need to know each other to understand what you?re promising. -That I heard. -So did I. -[Sadie] What?s that? -[Rebecca] Oh, the rabbi let us borrow it so that Adam could see all the possibilities. -So many ketubahs, so little time. -It?s all the types of calligraphy and paper and designs. -I don?t have a clue. -It?s your call. -Well, I like when the Hebrew and the English are next to each other. -You say it in both languages, it?s twice as true. -Hmm. I like the frame. -Jacob wanted something simple. But for me more is always more, so we settled on something in between. -Mmhmm. -What do you think? -I think we found it. -I know it?s the suburbs and a commute, but there are some really nice houses out here. -Listen, if I land the Body Now account, I?m probably gonna get a salary bump. We could buy a house and start a family sooner than we thought. -Yeah. Well, I wanna have three kids. -I like the sound of that. -And I wanna name one of the boys Hershel, after my Zayde. -Hershel? Not sure about Hershel. -Well, everyone will call him Harry. -Harry, let's... we'll go with Harry then. -Great. Harry and the twins could be very happy out here. -Oh, we?re having twins? -Mmhmm. -Oh, good to know. -Yeah. -All of the spots feature the same couple. Body Now takes them from attractive singles, to drop dead gorgeous, to madly in love. Who wouldn?t wanna sign up for that? -So? You like it? -Like it? I lived it. [all laughing] My wife used to be my personal trainer. -She is going to love this idea. Almost as much as me. Look, it has an active single sensibility, which is our target audience. -I used to be the guy you?re trying to reach. I went to school at Northwestern where I ran track. And learned how to write a 30-second romance. [all laughing] -See, what?d I tell you? He?s bright, he?s athletic, he gets it. -Nice work. -Thanks. -Oh... Oh, it?s subtle, elegant. -It?s a bit plain. Try the one with the tulle skirt, it has more pizazz. -I gather pizazz is allowed. -Okay. Next dress. -You and your fianc? have very different mothers. -With very different taste. -Maybe you should elope. -I love it. -That?s a lot of tulle. What about the veil? -Oh, we?re not doing the veiling. -Oh no, but it?s a lovely tradition. -Well, it?s a little antiquated. The groom lifting the veil to make sure it?s the right bride? -I?m gonna go try on another dress. This is why there are no mother in laws in romance novels. -Well, they are kind of a buzzkill. -Who knew finding a wedding dress would require a referee? -You?ve gotta stand up for yourself. -What do you think? -Do not let them talk you out of that dress. -I miss the pizazz. -There?s a fine line between pizazz and over the top. -This is the dress I wanna wear. I think it?s beautiful and I hope you do too. -That?s the dress. -I couldn?t agree more. -What about the shoes? -White satin sling-backs. -Or an open-toe silver pump. -Or maybe I could just wear one of each. -Hey! I... got some news for you. -We got it? We got the account? -We got the account! Charlie loved your pitch. -Oh yeah. [buttons beeping] Slowing down. -[laughs] -I mean, he?s kind of a character but I think I really like the guy. -Oh, he is. I mean, I?ve known him forever. We grew up together. He came up with this crazy idea. Neon resistance bands. I mean, why you need to see yourself working out in the dark? I don?t get it. But what do I know? He made a fortune and he bought all these gyms on the west coast. -Lucky for us. -Well, lucky for... you. I want you to run the LA office. -What? Oh... -Congratulations. You just became a VP. -[laughing nervously] I appreciate the offer... more than you know. but Rebecca?s a teacher, she loves her job. -They?ve got schools in LA. -It?s not that simple. She started an after-school program. She teaches kids art and how to read. She?s a Cubs fan, loves deep dish pizza, the way the wind whips off the lake in the winter. Most of all, she?s extremely close with her family. -Well, they can visit. Listen... Charlie will only sign with the agency if you relocate to LA to service the account. So... pack your bags, grab your beautiful bride and get ready to live your fabulous new life. You did it. Well done. [classical music playing] -[giggling] You are so cute. -Did you know they were gonna end up getting married? -I had a hunch. Speaking of weddings... The invitations. Now my mom and your mom had different opinions. I am still recovering from the wedding dress so I thought it would be safer to have them give me samples. -This is so easy because there are so few samples to choose from. -Well, I went to the stationery store and got a couple of my own. It?s a rush order so we have to decide right away. -Right. -Guess which mom chose which card? -Honestly? I don?t know if I love either one. The cards, not the mothers. -[laughs] Well, I found this one. It?s pretty, uniquely Jewish. This is the tree of life and it symbolizes new beginnings. -It?s perfect. -It is? -Yeah. -Our wedding invitation? -Our wedding invitation. -[giggling] -Speaking of, uh... new beginnings. I have some news. -About the wedding? -About us and our future. [sighs] Peter made me an offer I can?t refuse. It?s like the Godfather if it were set in the advertising world. -I don?t know whether to laugh or to worry. -He wants me to run the LA office. Which means I become a VP and nearly double my pay. -Wow. -Good wow or bad wow? -Just an all-purpose, overwhelmed, life-changing wow? -We?d be able to buy a really nice house. And start our family. -This job is... is this what you want? -I want a happy wife. Okay? -I could see Harry and the twins growing up in LA. [cheerful music] -What? Are we doing this? -We are. [both laughing] -[sighs] The wedding is in a month and the list keeps getting longer. Oh, did you talk to the florist about the chuppah? -I will. -I don?t wanna get ahead of myself or ahead of your wedding, but there?s a house a few blocks away that just came up for sale. -[sighs] I?m afraid that?s too long of a commute. Adam got a big promotion but it means moving to Los Angeles. -Oh. My goodness. I?ve always liked Los Angeles. -You?ve never even been there. -I?ve always wanted to go. -We?ll see each other on holidays and we?ll talk all the time. -I?ll just miss you, that?s all. -Me too. [emotional music] [phone ringing] Hi sweetheart. -Hey Mom. I have to get to the office but I have some news. I just made VP. -What? -I don?t wanna brag, but you?re my mom, so I will. The youngest VP in the history of the agency. I?m gonna be running the LA office. -Oh, honey. Congratulations. You are gonna love living in Los Angeles. -Yeah, I think so. I hope so. -Oh, this is so exciting! Maybe I?ll become a snowbird and I can spend the winters with you and Rebecca. Do you think she?ll mind? -Great. That... no, that sounds great. We're gonna talk about this later. I gotta go. Okay? -Oh... great, sweetheart. Buh-bye. [laughs] -He?s probably just stuck in traffic. He?ll be here any minute. -Sadie told me about the move to Los Angeles. How are you feeling about that? -Okay. I guess. I?ll miss my family. And the synagogue. I have so many memories here, you know? -Hey. Sorry. So sorry I?m late. I got stuck in a meeting with a new client. [phone chiming] Sorry. I... it's my boss. This looks bad. Just one second. There. He wanted to know why I left. -And what did you tell him? -To discuss my wedding. -And? -And... the ceremony. -And? -And... can I phone a friend? [phone chimes] I am... I am so sorry, just one more moment. -Can we put something in the wedding contract about the groom turning off his phone? -The answer we were looking for was the marriage itself and what it means. To respect each other. To know when to give in. -Turned off and giving in. -So... have you given any thought to the chuppah? -[sighs] Apparently not enough. -They?re setting up for a wedding in the synagogue right now. Let?s go take a look. -Great. -A chuppah symbolizes the home that you and Rebecca will build together. The four sides stay open, welcoming friends and family into your lives. Sometimes the parents stand under the chuppah with the bride and groom during the ceremony. -Oh, that means both our mothers. -We?re gonna need a bigger chuppah. -They?re all different. Find a way to make it your own. -Speaking of wedding rings... -We weren?t speaking of wedding rings. -Well, this is where we?re gonna exchange them so that?s on my mind. -Ah, right. -They should be plain gold bands. No jewels, just the perfect circle representing your never-ending love. -I always wanted to wear my Nana?s, she left it to me. -Wedding rings are often heirlooms of the heart. What about your father?s ring? -Oh, um... I don't know. -It was just an idea. Give it some thought. -I don?t care what kind of a ring I put on your finger. As long as you promise to keep it there forever. -I do. -I do too. -Hi. -Hi. Where?s the groom? -On his way to the airport. He has to go to LA for a few days. -So it?s just you, me and her? -Let?s make it fun. -Fun is my middle name. -Hello. -Hi. -Choosing the wedding cake may be my favorite thing on the list. -It?s mine too. -Please, after you. -No, please. Go right ahead. -Oh no, no. Please, after you. -No, you?re first. -It?s fine. -Oh, I insist. -Here you are ladies. -If I have one more bite I?m not gonna fit into the dress. -Mmm. Can we at least agree on the chocolate ganache? -Mmm, I like the coconut buttercream. -Oh, it?s too rich. -There?s no such thing when it comes to cake. -Maybe we could do alternating layers. [in unison] Mmm, that would look funny. -Well, at least you can agree on that. -What if we went with the cream cheese frosting? -[scoffs] When I hear cream cheese I think of lox. -It?s a Jewish wedding. Why not? And what about the cake toppers? -What did you have in mind? Well we need to leave room for their names on the top tier. -Everyone knows who?s getting married, we don?t need names. -What do you think? -Maybe we should just do cupcakes. So, they sent us home with samples. Two hours and 10,000 calories later to decide on chocolate mocha. -Mmm, you should get married more often. -Adam is a sweetheart but his mother is not easy. -Where is he? -He had to go to LA to meet with a client. -Mom, do we have any... Thank you! -Eww. -Don?t knock it ?till you try it. -I think you may be taking this pregnancy thing a little too far. -Mmm. I just hope I make it through your wedding without giving birth. [upbeat music] -I have a saying, you only feel as good as you look. Some people call that shallow. I call it true. -Body Now is Vanessa?s baby if you haven?t figured that out. -I?m on a mission. -My mission is to make money. -[clears throat] -And to help people get into shape. -Well my mission is to help you achieve both of yours. We started on the west coast but we want to go national. You know, turn it into a brand and a product line. You know, everything from protein powder to ankle weights. -Running track meant so much to me. A lot of your business is about personal trainers. Why not have a sports training program? You make more money and keep people engaged. -I like that idea. A lot. -Told you he was the right guy. [both laughing] -To Body Now. -To Body Now. -To Body Now. -I was... all... always... lone... -lone... -y... -Lonely. -Mmhmm. -Did you know that a lot of really famous people who did amazing things had dyslexia? -Like Albert Einstein and Picasso? -Who?s that? -He was a really great painter. -I love to paint! -Yeah. And someday you will love to read. -Yeah. -The... puppy... lived... happy... happily... ever after. -Great. -What does that mean? -You know, a lot of stories end that way and I think it has to do with love. You remember we talked about verbs? Love is a verb and it?s something you do with all of your heart that makes you really happy. -I?m really happy you?re my teacher. -Me too. -I know. I know. I?m sorry I?m late. Peter is turning my life into a meeting. Hi. -Hi. -Is my mom here? -They?re both inside. -How?s it going? -It?s a little tense. -Hmm. I can be the buffer. -Be the groom. These are the flowers for our wedding and it?s kind of a big deal... well, at least to me. -Your big deal is my big deal. -Nice save. -Thank you. -I?m on my lunch break so there?s not a whole lotta time for debate. -And I have to head back to the office. So let?s jump right in. -Well, I?m thinking pastels, with pink and white roses. That?s what I had at my wedding. -What about peonies? -Peonies. Absolutely. -Maybe some baby?s breath, that?s what I had at my wedding. -Oh, I?m afraid I?m allergic to baby?s breath. I don?t wanna be sneezing through your I do?s. -Okay. -It?s an immune response, not a choice. -What about lavender? It is so calming. -Let?s go with lavender then. All the lavender the chuppah can hold. -Are they always like that? -Pretty much. -Coffee? -Yeah. -Two. Well it?s a good thing we?re moving to LA. -What do you mean? -Well they won?t have to see each other as much. -I don?t want them to see less of each other, I want them to get along. -I know, so do I. -Adam, family is everything to me. -I... of course. I know that. -Do you? -You?re not hearing me. [phone pings] -I heard that. The rabbi said falling in love is not enough and that we have to work really hard to make a marriage work. -[sighs] What do you think we?re doing right now? -Working really hard. -Yeah. You and I are gonna keep doing that for the rest of our lives. [phone pings] [phone pings] -I?m not answering it. -Just answer it. -No way. -You picked up a lot of food. -Just... just the usual amount of deli stuff for your dad. Who I happen to know will really, really like it. -You don?t have to try so hard, he already approves of you. -Look, I?m taking his daughter halfway across the country. An aggressive amount of pastrami is the least I could do. -[chuckles] You should call him and my mother Mom and Dad. -Really? -Yeah. Hannah told Elliot to do it when they got engaged and it worked like a charm. -Hmm. -We need to go over the RSVPs. -Mm. -This is really good pastrami. -Oh, thanks... Dad. -You?re welcome, son. -And the flowers are just lovely. -Oh, good. I'm glad you like them... Mom. -You realize your mom is sitting right here. -Would it be alright if I called you Mom? -Okay. -I finalized the menu with the caterers and ordered the champagne. -Since you and Jacob are hosting the wedding reception, I would like to host the rehearsal dinner. -Oh... -Aw, thank you. -That is so wonderful... Mom... [door opens and closes] -Hello! Oh, I smell deli. Deli, deli, deli, deli, deli. -Hey guys. -Everything looks so good. I have two modes, sleeping and eating. [all chuckling] -Everything is set for the reception. Adam will stomp on the glass and we?re off for the party. -Unless the glass doesn?t break. Then dinner might be late. -[chuckling] That?s a real thing that can happen? -Oh yeah, it happened to us. I thought it was a sign. Don?t marry this guy. -[laughing] I kept stomping on the glass but it just wouldn?t break. It was the longest 23 seconds of my life. -The moral is, marriage takes a lot of effort but it?s worth it. -Mmm. And wear cleats to your wedding. -Um, pass the bagels, Mom. -Oh. Oh. Which mom? -Um... either. [chuckles] -I have the same problem with my mother in law. -If Diane is easier... -Mom. -Everything okay? -Yeah. I'm just... I'm a bit anxious about the wedding. There's a lot to remember. -Yeah. -Even the simple stuff like circling. -[chuckles] -I know it means a lot to Rebecca, I just want to get it right. -Circling is a breeze. -Oh. -[clicks tongue] -Okay. It's like a... it's like a walk off home run. You just... you just touch all the bases. -There?s nothing to it, bro. May I call you that? -Why, yes you can. Bro. -Bro. -Bro. -[laughs] -Look, circling used to just be the bride. But I like that it?s both of you because that?s how marriage works. Sure, you go in circles sometimes, but you hang in. -If you didn?t make the lunch, do I still have to help with the clean up? -It?s in the ketubah, you signed it. -What, you can put that in a wedding contract? -It says we will help each other and share all of life's burdens. -[Jacob] What she said. -[Sadie] That?s right. -Need any help, Dad? -Sure. I'll wash and... you dry. -Deal. -How?s it going guys? -It?s going very well. -I?m trying to get the board to spring for more art supplies. It?s like pulling teeth. -Hopefully we?ll have more funding next year. -Um... we need to actually talk about that. -I?m sorry you have to pay for so much out of pocket. -No, no. It's... it's not that. It's just, um... next year I won't be coming back. -You?re not happy here? -No. I'm... I'm so happy. I just... Adam got a job in Los Angeles. And, um, you know, advertising pays better than teaching and we wanna start a family soon. And you?re not just my boss. You?re my mentor and my friend and I guess telling you made it a little official and I wasn?t ready to do that. -The kids are gonna miss you. And so will I. -This is where I became a teacher. -Why don?t you wait until the end of the semester to hand in your resignation? -Is that my friend or my boss talking? -Both. -These two. -Perfect. -I like these two. -Hey. How?s it going? -Good. What?s up? -Good is not good enough. Okay? Charlie is still negotiating his contract so you have to dazzle him. -And I will. -Ah-ha! Dazzle. -[laughing] Dazzle. -Alright. -[laughing] [sharp exhale] You know, it?s not easy to dazzle and prep for my wedding at the same time. I?m either late for one or the other. -Well, you wanted to be VP. -I?m VP?ing. I?m VP?ing. -Treadmill? -Treadmill. -Treadmill. -[Diane] Oh, Randall Sanders will be attending. He?s a partner at the agency. -Maggie and Ellis are coming. Jacob?s aunt and her husband. -You know, a wedding is a nice way to personalize a business relationship. -Yes, of course, but it?s also for family and friends. -Well, that?s why we have two sides of the aisle. -[Adam] You handled that really well. -Ugh. I just wish our moms would get along. -Things will calm down after the wedding. -[sighs] Yeah. Well, as Jane Austen might say, we can?t let external forces overwhelm what?s in our hearts. -Forces being our moms? -Yeah. Aside from being opinionated they are nothing alike. Sometimes it feels like we were raised on different planets. -I like it on your planet. -[chuckles] -Especially your taste in art. You know, those kids are getting really good. -Yeah, they?re like little Monet?s that make me smile. As for the art on your planet, um, I?m not sure how I feel about the Jackson Pollock wannabes that hang on your wall. -Look, you?re gonna need to learn to love those Jackson Pollock wannabes. Okay? ?Cause pretty soon we?ll be sharing our walls. Okay. And our bookshelves. I?ve never seen so much romance. To say nothing of your taste in movies. -Hey, it?s who I am. And if we?re honest, it?s who you are too. -Shut up. "You had me at hello." -Jerry Maguire. "You complete me." -Oh. Tom Cruise, same movie. Please. Now, now. "Here?s looking at you, kid." -Casablanca. Easy. "I?m just a girl, standing in front of a boy, "asking him to love her." -Ooh, Notting Hill for the win! And he does. I have to get to the airport. I?m gonna miss my flight. -Who said that? -Me just now. Come here. I love you. "I?ll be back." -I love you too, Arnold. [traffic sounds] -Background. And... action. Sipping. You?re sipping, you?re sipping. Mmm. Oh! Let?s try that again. Do the sipping, sipping, sipping. Mmm. Then smile. Like you mean it this time. And... action. Sipping, sipping, sipping, sipping, sipping. Mmm. And smile. You're in love. And... cut. Tail slate. Perfect! You need a spit bucket for that chlorella? -It's looking good. Right? It's, it's... it's really coming together. Don't you think? -Well, I like the ending. -But we need to focus on the smoothie. He should be drinking one too. It?s after his workout, he?s thirsty. You know, whatever. [phone ringing] -This isn?t about a beverage. The payoff is our couple getting together, all pumped up and glowing thanks to Body Now. -Have them both take a few sips before they fall in love. -Absolutely. You got it. [phone ringing] Hi baby. -Hi. Do you have a second? It?s about the wedding. -Uh, barely. -The band we booked may have to cancel. -They need to drink more. -What? -How is that going to help? -It?s what Charlie wants. -What does Charlie have to do with this? -It?s his money. -Charlie?s not paying for the band. Charlie?s not even coming to the wedding. -Uh, yeah. Yeah. He, uh, he feels really bad about that so he and his wife are taking us to lunch. [sighs] I gotta go. I love you. -Okay. [sighs] Sometimes I feel like he really doesn?t hear me. [sighs] -Hey. You look beautiful. -I changed my clothes three times. I wanted to look fashionable but not like I was trying too hard. -Why do you care so much about this? -This is the first time I?m meeting people from your other life. -Okay, these are not my people. These are my clients. -[laughs] Wow. -Oh, this is so Charlie. Go big or don?t go. -I should?ve worn something fancier. -Don?t mess with perfection. Thank you. -I?m so sorry we can?t make the wedding. -We?ll be in Calabasas opening another Body Now. -We?re hoping for a big celebrity turnout. -A little free press never hurts. -Well, thank you so much for taking us to lunch. I hear the food here is amazing. -Yeah, we go to these great restaurants and Vanessa won?t let me near the carbs. -Well, you?ll thank me when you weigh yourself tomorrow morning. -Hmm. Let me order the pasta and I?ll thank you right now. [both chuckling] -[laughing nervously] So, do you guys live in Chicago or LA? -We?re back and forth all the time. -Yeah. When I hit it big, I bought a penthouse overlooking Lake Michigan just to remind myself how far I?ve come. -I?m so over the cold winters. -Yeah. -We just bought a house in Beverly Hills. -Yeah, no lake, but it?s got one of those infinity pools. -Mmhmm. -I walked in and I knew we were home. 18,000 square feet of prime real estate and the best schools in the city. -I didn?t know you had kids. [both laughing] -We don?t. It increases the value of the house. I mean, you have to think about these things before you buy. -Right. Mmhmm. -Um... [clears throat] Rebecca is a teacher. -That must be so rewarding. -It is. -I admire teachers. Long days, not enough pay. I coached little league for a minute but I couldn?t hack it. -Well, you should try it again some time. Helping a kid believe in themselves is so worth the effort. -The team was losing and I am way too competitive. -Which is why you?re so successful. -Does that mean I get to order the cheesecake? [both laughing] [all laughing] -Oh... -I was joking. -She is never gonna let me have dessert for the rest of my life. -[laughing] Oh no. You?re welcome. -Thank you. -So, what?d you think? -They?re an interesting couple. -And by interesting, you mean...? -Ulgh. -[laughs] Well, he keeps her in diamonds, she keeps him thin. -I don?t want us to end up like them. Okay? I wanna be like my parents. -I wanna be like... you and me. -Well, I guess we just have to figure out what that is then. -Yeah. [cheerful music] -So. The wedding is in 10 days. How you doing? -Good. -Fine. -Let?s try that again. -It?s a big step. -The biggest one you?ll ever take. -And we do love each other, in spite of our differences. -I mean, opposites attract. Right? -Do they stay happily married? -Differences can keep a marriage lively. You learn from each other. You grow together. -I'm... I'm growing. We're growing. We're growing so much, growing as we speak. -What matters most is your willingness to put each other?s happiness first. That?s the trait you need to share. Except for when it comes to what to watch on TV, then all bets are off. [Rebecca chuckles] Now, regarding the wedding, I had an idea that may be of value. Normally both parents walk the groom down the aisle. -Oh, I only have my mom. So... -Perhaps we could cover the chuppah with your father?s prayer shawl. It?s a way to include him in the ceremony and to honor his memory. -I?d like that. -I would too. -I hope I can find it. -Your mom will know where it is. -Yeah. Yeah. I want my father at my wedding. -We forgot to invite our most important guest. -Well, tell them I can meet with them tomorrow. -Absolutely not. I need the Body Now print ads yesterday. -I chose the fixtures. The plumber is not my responsibility. -Okay. Okay. Bye. -If we knock out the closets, there?s enough room for the double sink. -Mom. -Well then we have to move the window. -Mom. Mom. I need to talk to you. -Look, I?m gonna have to call you back. I?m sorry, hon. I have to go home for a few days. I need to deal with some clients. What did you want to talk to me about? -Dad. -Okay. -Do you know where his prayer shawl is? -Yes, I know exactly where it is. -I wanted it for the chuppah. -He would?ve loved that. -Yeah, um... there's something else. His wedding ring... would it be okay if I wore it? -[teary] It would be everything. -[laughing] Okay. -Aww. [plates clinking] -The wedding is in a week and she just takes off like that. -Well, she?s got a business to run. -Her son is getting married. What could be so important? -I thought you didn?t like her meddling. -I don?t. I like to complain about it. -[laughs] Well you could complain about the way I load the dishwasher. I forget, uh, bowls go in the top? [both chuckling] [emotional music] -May his memory be a blessing. [crying softly] -[Nick] I thought the commercial looked great. What?s the problem? -I don?t know. Charlie?s wife wants the actress?s skin to glow more. -If she were any shinier you?d be able to see her from space. What are we supposed to do? -About what? -Uh... about global warming. About the commercial! -I don't know. I... [sighs] All I can think about is the wedding. The day of the marriage, before we walk down the aisle, Rebecca and I sign the ketubah. -What?s that? -Marriage contract. You?re the best man so you?ll be my witness. Rebecca?s sister is the maid of honor so she?ll be the other witness. You need to have two. -It?s a legal thing? -It's like a... like a tradition. -Oh, a Jewish prenup. -Just be there. Okay? -I?ll be there, I?ll be there. -Hey. You need to go to LA. -What? When? -Now. -No. I?m about to get married. -Charlie wants to do a reshoot. He did not like that director. Okay? So he needs you there. -I?m sorry, Peter. -[laughs] Charlie?s lawyer is still haggling over the contract so we need to keep him happy and that means you hopping on a plane. Listen, you'll... you'll be back in a few days, you can marry Rebecca, you become a VP. Alright? I want your problems. -Oh boy. -The... magic train... went so fast... it... -You got this. -It jump... jumped... it jumped off the tracks and began to fly! -Yes! High five. Down low. Ooh, too slow. [chuckles] -Hi. -Hi. -Hi. Hey. -We were just... we were just finishing up. This is one of my students, Kevin. And this is my fianc?, Adam. -Hi Kevin. -I?ll be right back. -Oh. -So. You?re the guy she?s gonna marry? -Yeah, that?s me. -Miss Singer is my favorite teacher. -She?s my favorite teacher too. -She better be. You make sure she lives happily ever after. -[sighs] I will, kid. -I have to go, my mom is waiting. -Nice to meet you Kevin. -We have a special relationship. -Yeah. No, he seems like a sweet kid. -[laughs] I thought we could grab some pizza before meeting the photographer. -I can?t. -Why not? -I have to fly to LA tonight. -I?m sorry, have we met? I?m the woman you?re about to marry, and last time I checked, the wedding was in Chicago. But apparently not anymore. -We?re reshooting the commercial then I?m on the next plane back. -We still have so much to do and you?re leaving me alone with our bickering mothers? -I know, it isn?t like I want to go. Charlie hasn?t signed the contract and Peter is doing whatever it takes. -What about the contract you?re about to sign with me? -They?re not mutually exclusive. -You sure about that? -We?ll call the calligrapher and add a clause. The groom vows to attend the wedding. -He?d better. -Everything?s all set for the reception. -I still haven?t heard from him. -I like Adam, you know that, but this is cutting it awfully close. -Well this isn?t his fault. The actor?s got some sort of a rash so they had to add another shoot day. -Wedding rehearsal is very important. It seems like he could use it. [phone rings] -It?s him. Hi. I was starting to worry. -I just got off a plane that landed in St. Louis. -You?re in St. Louis? -I couldn?t get a direct flight and my connecting flight got delayed because of the weather. -Well what are you gonna do? -I?ll be okay, don?t worry. -You don?t sound not worried. How should I not worry? He?s in St. Louis. -You should worry. -I?m about to catch a train that will get me to Chicago in time for the rehearsal. -When does it get you in? -2:45. -Adam, the rehearsal is at 4:00. -I gotta go, I?ll call you from the train. -Okay. Well, Hannah and I are going to our hair appointment so just keep me posted. -Okay. -Maybe I should just cancel my appointment? -If you get stood up, at least you wanna look good. -[GPS voice] At the roundabout, take the second exit. -What are you talking about? -[GPS voice] In 200 feet, take the roundabout. -There is no roundabout! There is no roundabout. [phone ringing] Hey. -[GPS voice] Take the roundabout. -There is no roundabout. -Who is that? -[sighs] The GPS. -Why do you need GPS on the train? -I missed the train so I rented a car. -Where are you? -Somewhere in Illinois. -Could you be more specific? -I am taking planes, trains and automobiles to get to the synagogue on time. -You said you missed the train. -Two out of three is still pretty stressful. -[GPS voice] Take the roundabout. -Oh. -Just call me when you figure out where you are. Okay? -Okay. [sighs] [sighs] Okay. Happy place. Happy place. -[GPS voice] Take the roundabout. -[sighs] -Adam wanted me to thank you all for being here at the wedding rehearsal. Hopefully he'll be here soon but he is stuck in traffic outside of Bloomfield, so... he's not exactly sure when that will be. -But dinner is still at 7:00 no matter what. -Never mind the rehearsal, what matters is the meal. [phone ringing] -Oh! It?s Adam. Hi. Where are you? -Don?t ask. -Well, uh... everyone is here waiting. -I'm waiting too! I was stuck in traffic for so long I... I ran out of gas, and now I'm waiting for a tow truck. -What?s he saying? -Put him on speaker. -No. No, no, no. Do not put me on speaker. [on speakerphone] Whatever you do, do not put me on speaker. -Sorry buddy. It?s too late. -Hi... hey... -Hi Adam. -Hi hon. -Where are you? -Shalom. -Hi everybody. It is great to... to hear your voices. I am so sorry for the delay, it couldn't be helped. -When do you think you might be here? -It?s hard to say. -Well, if we don?t start soon, we?re gonna be late for the dinner. -This is what you?re worried about? -Hey, maybe Adam can FaceTime the rehearsal. -Ugh. -Yeah, I don't think the groom phoning it in is gonna work. So... We?ll see you when you get here. -Okay. -Well, at least you know he didn?t run off with someone else. [laughing nervously] -That?s not funny. -You know, I?m just trying to do my best man thing. -And I?m just trying to do my big sister thing. -Uh... let's begin and then Adam can join in when he arrives. -Okay. Who am I supposed to walk down the aisle? -The invisible man my daughter?s supposed to marry. -Ouch. -Adam will break the glass and then kiss the bride. -Hey! Hey, I?m here. -Mazel tov! -Really? -I?m here. So sorry I am late. [panting] -It?s better incredibly late than never, buddy. -I?m so sorry. -At least you made it in time for the dinner. -Hey. You know what they say, a bad dress rehearsal means a great show. -Who says that? -[sighs] It?s a theatre thing. -But this isn?t a show, it?s our wedding. [glass clinking] -To the bride and groom. May the wedding go better than the rehearsal. -Here, here! [laughing] -Really? -How is everybody doing? -Never better. -Tomorrow is the big day. -Tomorrow is the big day. -How do you feel? -Overwhelmed. -About the wedding, work... what? -All of the above. -Talk to me. -I do love him... with all my heart. But if he doesn't have time for a wedding, he's not gonna have time for a marriage. -Rebecca left with her sister. -I?m afraid they might call off the wedding. -You and I are not cut from the same cloth but we have one thing in common. We both love our kids. -And our kids love each other. -So what are we going to do? -Whatever it is, we?d better do it right now. -Wait for me. -What is going on with you and Rebecca? -[sighs] She thinks we have different priorities and I?m beginning to think she?s right. -Love is the only priority you need and that you?ve got. -She thinks my work comes first. -Well there has to be a balance. -Okay. This from the woman who works 24/7. -Adam... your father was the love of my life. And when I lost him, I just threw myself into overdrive, only to find out that you can't outrun your feelings. Trust me when I tell you, work is no substitute for love. -Listen to your mother. She?s a very wise woman. -I?m all in. It?s Rebecca you?ve gotta convince. -I?ve always dreamed of getting married and raising a family like the one I grew up in. But Adam has dreams of his own and I?m not sure they?re compatible. -I think they are. -I don?t wanna raise Harry and the twins by myself ?cause he has to work all the time. -Uh... Harry and the who? -It?s what Adam and I call the kids we?re gonna have. -Oh. -Now that sounds like a man who wants a family as much as you. -Let me ask you a question, the only one that counts. Would your life be happier with Adam by your side? -Yes. He?s the love of my life. -Then if I were you, I?d go get married. -Diane is right. -When did you two get so close? -Well, why wouldn?t we be? [in unison] We?re family. -Please. Call me Mom. [knock at door] -Becs, it?s me. [knocking at door] Okay. Okay. I?m sorry for being late for the rehearsal. But I promise to show up every day for the marriage. Every single day until the end of our days. The rabbi was right. Nothing matters more than your happiness. -Except for yours. -"I never wish to be parted from you from this day on." -My favorite Jane Austen quote. -Will you still marry me? -Yes. [laughs] -Oh! -Save the kiss for the wedding. -Oh, right. -Hey. What are you doing here, aren?t you supposed to be getting married? -I am handing in my resignation. -I wanna do it with a clear conscience. Which is why I've decided... I'm not moving to LA. -You?re sure this is what you want? -Oh. No, no, no, no. Charlie will not be okay with that. And he still hasn?t signed his contract with the agency. -My wedding contract matters more. -Yes. -What... what can I do to convince you? I can give you a better deal. I can give you more money. -I?m staying in Chicago. Rebecca?s family?s here and she loves her job. Her happiness comes first. -Adam?s happiness comes first. -If you change your mind, there will always be a place here for you. -Thank you. For everything. -Words are fleeting but writing them in the ketubah means they never get erased. -Before we sign, there?s something you should know. I told Peter I?m not moving to LA. We?re staying right here. All that matters is your happiness. -All that matters is your happiness, which is why I told Marion I?m moving to Los Angeles and handed in my resignation. -Wow. Uh... you guys have a real Gift of the Magi thing happening. -Wisdom can come from all corners. -We are going to Los Angeles and you are going to be a VP. -No, we are staying in Chicago. This is where you belong and I belong with you. -You were right about him. He?s the one. -So, what are you guys gonna do? -It doesn?t matter where we live. -Or how much money there is. -As long as we?re together. [in unison] We have all we need. -You just brought the meaning of the ketubah to life. Now, make this commitment while your hearts are so full. -Sign it already. [all chuckling] -And use your best penmanship, you?re gonna be looking at this for years to come. [phone pings] -Don?t worry, it wasn?t me. -[phone pings] -Wait. Yup! That was me. -Sorry. -Told you. -Wow, it?s blowing up. -[chuckling] -Uh, Adam, it's Peter. It says Charlie doesn't wanna lose Adam... Adam can stay in Chicago! -Oh, that?s wonderful! -Wow, what? -Congratulations! -It?s beshert. -The Gift of the Magi just keeps on giving. [all laughing] -The more you give, the more you receive. [Pachelbel?s Canon in D playing] This is the day of all days and he?s here to share it. -I love you. -I love you too. -Love her as much as we do. -You may be seated. You stand under this chuppah, the symbol of the Jewish home, surrounded by those who love you. May the home you build together be as happy and blessed. Now, I know you?re a little nervous, but don?t overdo it. [all chuckling] -Okay. -Take a sip of wine. And now hold the wine to the lips of your bride. With a single cup, you are joined together to drink from the cup of life. -It?s okay. It?s me. -It?s us. -In the ketubah, you made promises to each other, including the gift of simcha... happiness. Today you share that gift with all of us here. And now, for the promise we all got dressed up to hear. Adam, do you take Rebecca to be your wife... to love, to honor and to cherish? -I do. -Rebecca, do you take Adam to be your husband... to love, to honor and to cherish? -I do. -Now we exchange rings. Repeat after me. [reciting vows in Hebrew] Harei at... -Harei at... -M'kudash li... -M'kudash li... -B'taba'at zo... -B'taba'at zo... -K'dat Mosheh v'Yisrael. -K'dat Mosheh v'Yisrael. -By this ring... -By this ring... -You are consecrated unto me... -You are consecrated unto me... -According... -According to the laws of Moses and the people of Israel. -You are now husband and wife. Okay, Adam. You?re up. Break the glass. [guests laugh] [glass shatters] [all together] Mazel tov! [applause] [cheers and applause] [Hava Nagila playing] -I love you, Rebecca! -You?d better! It?s in the ketubah. [rhythmic clapping]
