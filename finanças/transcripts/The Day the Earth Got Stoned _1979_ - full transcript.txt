[dramatic music] The story of The Secret World War all began at dawn at Lawrence Milk's huge record warehouse in Polka Waltz, New Jersey. Hello, Polka Waltz lovers. This is the Lightning Bug. And a one, and a two, and a go, go, go. The boys in the band are ready to blow! [explosion] [rock music] [sirens blaring] Good morning, Mr. Milk. The hypnotic beat that's being broadcast on this bug is called rock and roll, brought to you by the Lightning Bug. Now, I command you to waltz over to the window, because I'm going to blow you away, just like my gang blew your square warehouse away, baby. It's time for you to drop out. Yeah! Yeah! [screaming] Good day, Jive Davis. I'm beaming to you on this bug from my palace on the moon, man. Soon I will rule the Earth, but you stand in the way of my plans, so I'm scratching all you square record kings. I command you to pick up that gun, because you're going to help make me and my music number one. With a bullet! [gun fires] Well, if it isn't the famous bandleader, Mr. Screen Dorsey. Where do you think you're going, square hair? Off to the arrogant ballroom to play some more wimpy waltzes through a crowd of dippy debutantes? Well, think again, four-ears, because you're going on a different trip, and so is the whole world. And you're listening to the crazy sound that's going to do it! [music playing on radio] Don't fight it. You and your car are under my power. Don't you love it? Don't you want to tap your toes to it? But don't tap the brake, because they don't work. (LAUGHS) There ain't nothing going to stop this music, Mister. 'Cause dig it, baby, my jive is gonna drive you and your drive right over the edge! [screaming] Far out! I'm the Lightning Bug, and my rock and roll invasion of Earth is underway. Look at them. They'll be rocked and rolled. They'll all shake and dance. You're a genius, oh, terrible master. There's no end to your evil. And now I must split to Earth in my Rocket 88, and personally trained willing slaves to spread my deadly music, and enslave the Earth as I enslave the moon. Pack all my disguises. All of them? You heard me, Mooney. All of them! (LAUGHS) Come on out, willing slaves. Welcome to radio school. Don't push. Move it. Say, where's the Student Union? Where's the co-eds you promised us? Shut up and get inside. Damn [? bunning. ?] Don't want you freshmen late for class. This doesn't look like a night school. It's night, ain't it? Move it. Where's the school ties and blazers? Come on. Where's the (STAMMERING) broadcasting equipment. Boy, you got a bad speech impediment. You're next. Where's the boys room? I got to take a wicked piss. No one leaves class. Y'all better keep that crap in you. Why do you need our fingerprints? We're not criminals. (STAMMERING) We just want to learn to talk good on the radio and make the big bucks. You'll all be radio heroes soon. Just clam up, mush mouths, and listen to the boss in the chair. What boss? Where? [laughing] Oh, you can't see me, can you? Well, that's the magic of radio, baby. (LAUGHS) Hey. Hello, students. I'm the Lightning Bug, and welcome to the lightning Bug School of Pirate Broadcasting. Not affiliated with those pirates at the buggery school of fly casting. You wimpy noodles will be given new voices and personalities through EST: electronic sensuality transformation. I'm going to turn you brown chewed squares into disk jockeys, working for my secret broadcast cave. And now your new IDs as DJs. You're the freeway freak. Knowing your electricity, I'm with the wingnut from-- You were are the wingnut. Now you're the freeway freak. The morning drive time DJ. You'll drive them crazy. Then you, turkey. You don't know disco from Crisco, but as Dr. Cool, they'll dance out of their pants to the sounds you send them. And you'll all get French jeans, out of sight salaries, and all the coffee and cigarettes you can drink. You'll be stars, and they won't even know who you are. You, dipsticks, stars? It makes me laugh. (LAUGHS) Take them to the secret broadcast cave and train them all to talk like me, real sexy. Come on, DJ. [lightning bug laughing] Chief, here's the latest report on those mysterious murders. Well, according to our investigations, Barton, the series of murders is tied up with a plot to destroy good music as we know it. And replace it with what, sir? With garbage like this. What's that, chief? It's a transcription we took off one of these weird bug shaped receiving devices at the scene of the crime. And I want you to send this over to our secret agents meeting tonight. Get going. Right, chief. Holy, cheese. I'm just a mealy mouthed tax collector, but when the J-Men call it's out of this drip dry shirt and baggy woolen suit, and-- The Lone Star rides again! Hi ho, harly, away! (SINGING) I'm a super copper. I'm a super chopper. There's no job too dangerous or too small for me. I'm the actor of-- Uh, oh! Ow. Oh, I forgot my protector. Oh, God. I'm supposed to be listening to this recording in some old mansion. Aha! Mansion accomplished. J-Men Cufflink and J-Men Armhole are here with the mysterious music. Oh, goody, now we can start. Hmm. There must have been a sale on those suits. This is the worst of the J-Gang, Ms. Cameldung. Mr. Crank, Buzz Cufflinks, and James Armhole. How do you do it? How do you? That's his secret. Here's the mysterious music the Lone Star delivered. Let's hear it. The mysterious music? Thank you. What, is it a pornographic record? I don't know why everybody's getting the fox trots over some loony tune. Well, we'll see. [music playing] (SINGING) Oh, baby. Move cloesr to me. I've had all that I can stand. Take hold of me with your hands. Oh, baby, you give me the chills. Whisper low in my ear. Let me know how it feels just to know you are near. Your body gives me a thrill, as it leans against mine. I love how it feels-- [music stops] This kind of music could get me pregnant. [all murmuring] We better warn the censors. Take it to the federal culture control. Good idea, Miss. Goodbye now. That music made me so horny, even those four geeks looked good. Gentlemen, the purpose of this demonstration is to show you tight-assed blue noses on the federal culture control the dangerous effects of this degenerate music. My name is Admiral Balzy of the J-Men. [music playing] I'm turning it up, so hold onto your pants. [chuckles] Now, watch that flask of my mother's milk, as I slowly increase the volume. This so-called music could turn our brain like this milk to cheese. Oh, my God! Good morning, Los Angeles. This is the sound of KRAP, middle of the road, music of robots radio. And to get us off this morning, we're going to listen to the soft safe sounds of Mr. Prissy Faye and his orchestra. Hello, LA, and make way, because this is the Lightning Bug, your pirate DJ. Bless my soul, you're all under the control of rock and roll! Get it, baby! [rock music] Rock and roll you right on down the hill. Way out, Bill! This one's a scream, baby. Whoo! Yeah! Don't look back, Jack. Here's one for your old flame. It's a hot one. This is an off-the-wall tune I brought from the moon. Gonna hook you right on down the bottom of the lagoon. (CACKLING) What is this place? You're in a secret broadcast cave, commissioner. The big boss will be here soon, so keep your shirt on. Well, they often call me Speedo, but my real name is Lightning Bug. Swell, mask, boss. What mask? Well, if it isn't the head of the federal cultural control, Yank Smellfinger. Assholes like you have kept this country in a cultural straitjacket for years, and now you're in a straitjacket. What are you? I'm the Lightning Bug, baby. The boss man of the moon. And now, commissioner, I'm going to put you under the spell of rock and roll, and you will help me with my plan to rule the airwaves, and then the Earth. Don't threaten me. You pitiful buttoned-down bureaucrat. (LAUGHS) Your worthless life is finally going to mean something. I'm going to collar you for a very special purpose. You see this teeny weeny little invention of mine. I call it a transistor radio. A transistor, Mister. Can you dig it? (LAUGHS) Looks harmless, doesn't it? But these cheap looking little gimmicks are going to destroy your so-called culture. Listen to that sound. You better get used to it, because you're going to hear it everywhere, square nuts. Nonsense. Oh, yeah? Hook him up, boys. Ain't that a beauty? Goes great with basic black. I'm having millions of them built for me in Tokyo. I'm going to flood the world with them. (LAUGHS) Good morning, your rough excretionsy. These records show the purchase of transistors for your purposes. I've been able to buy control of the specific miniature parts company. It'll be the perfect front to get these devices through customs. Transistors, Mister. Rock and roll. Can you dig it? Is the company, is a large one? The biggest and small parts of this contract to deliver parts from all the shipyards. You have been well paid for your services, Mr. Williams. We do not need you any longer. But you can call me anytime. Uh-huh. Get down, get down. Don't ever squawk. Never more, never more. This black bird'll sting him. He'll be dead. All right. Bye bye, black mail. Boss, how are you going to ship his little [? rangers ?] to America? This morning, we have already loaded the small freighter. What will happen is, it will be met somewhere in the south waters of the Atlantic. By normal size submarine filled with our abnormal allies to deliver transistor radios to Los Angeles. Hitler. He only had one ball. [? new, ?] where's Los Angeles? We don't know, sir. If it does not appear within an hour, I will assume my previous instructions were incorrect and that we've mucked it up totally. Yes, excellently. But we must deliver these Tokyo transistors. You're telling me. I shall wait until the fuhrer's little hands meet, and then we'll prepare our last resort. Mhm, a center for Eva Braun. Land! We've sighted land! Attention, crew. We seem to have made a little mistake. We're on the East Coast instead of the West Coast. All right, submarine heroes, prepare the torpedoes. We're going to blast our way through. Number one tube ready. Fire! Hit again. Hit again. Harder, harder! Number two tube ready. Fire! (SINGING) Geobbels has had no balls at all. Excellent singing. Let me see. Mm-hmm. [speaking german] What a blast! On to LA! This is Admiral Balzy of the J-Men with an update on the secret World War presently being waged against our culture. With the latest report, here's the head of foreign operations, Fred Marlowe. We're up against an organization so ruthless and so powerful, it's a wonder we're still alive to talk about it. What have you found? I've discovered a mystery involving international spies who will stop at nothing. Indeed, a flood of senseless sensual music has been drowning out every sensible speaker in the city, with our crappy crisp popovers-- I mean, our crafty cryptographers are working day and night to uncover some clue from this relentless flow of garbled gibberish. I got a shimmy new say coming through. Doo doo ron ron? What can that mean? [interposing voices] So, look out, Lightning Bug, whoever you are, because our brave J-Men are in the field tracking you down with our newest secret weapon, the rock and roll detector. Your stupid rotten music is going to lead us right to you, wherever you are. We are overwhelmingly overconfident. I mean, we are whelmingly confident that our unrelentless efforts will bring this war like the speech to a just honorable conclusion. And thank you. OK, you can go whiz us now, Admiral, we're off the air. Over here, J-Girl. It seems to be getting louder. Ugly sound, isn't it? [music playing] Uh-huh. Just look at the rock and roll detector. It's this way. Admiral Balzy will be so proud of us, Lance. I think we finally discovered the Lightning Bug's pirate broadcast center. Yeah. We'll probably get a medal for this, Claire. Hmm. The rock and roll's right here. It is here, J-Snoops. [both gasp] The Bug! You can thank the rock and roll detector for leading you to your doom. Thanks. These tunnels connect with a subterranean lake, which I use to dispose of my enemies. Eat hot lead! Open the floodgates and drown the rats. I'm going to wash these J-Men out of our lair. Square nuts. (LAUGHS) Come on, Claire. [claire gasps] This [inaudible] suit's not [inaudible].. If it gets wet, I'll be squeezed to death. Don't you just love the sound of the ocean? (GASPS) Nutty broad. Look, Lance, there's the beach property I wanted to show you. It's beautiful, except in high tide. (SCREAMS) I can't understand you. Speak up! You sound like you're gurgling. Agent Lance was what? He was-- (COUGHING) What's the matter, Barton? Lance, sir, he's all washed up. Oh, sorry, sir. Never mind that. Look, get me Spike on the phone. He's a sharp agent. We'll appoint him. Good idea, sir. Hello, get me Agent Spike. He's doing a plumbing job for us at 14 Market Street. [phone rings] What's that? Two rings, that's a secret code. Must be the chief. [phone rings] Three rings, this must be important. I'd better get it. Hello, Spike. Guess who? It's the chief, and listen up, because this is the mission you've been waiting for. What do you say? Come on, say something, Spike. Say the secret word. What's the matter, you forgot it? So have I. Look, let's both look it up and I'll call you back. And stay close to that phone. We're sorry, but we have a problem in taking your call as dialed. Please check the number and dial again, or ask your operator to help you. She'll get around to it as soon as she's good and ready. Guess what? This is the Lightning Bug. You J-Jokers don't realize how serious I am. Well, stick around, Spike. Sooner or later, you'll get the point. (LAUGHS) Phone's still busy, chief. I guess Spike must have gotten really hung up on something. I'll tell you what, Barton. I think it's time we called in the really big guns. I got a big gun chief. The girls love them, especially when you wear them under a tight suit. I'm not talking about you, baby face. I'm talking about the Caped Madman. If we can get him here in time. That madman on the loose again? He's on a delicate peacekeeping mission in one of the hottest trouble spots on the map today. Sauteed Arabia. There they are. Dirty towel heads. Hey-yo! Ah! No, what are you doing? We're on your side. We are wasting away. You win, huh. I'll show you what we think of you, one worders. Eat dirt, [inaudible]. Uh-oh. More trouble. Off I go, wearing my tight pajamas. Flying high, this is the life. Hey-yo! Take this, dummy. (LAUGHS) Goodness gracious. This prick in the pajamas is psycho. Shoot him. Shoot the white devil. Mmm, feels good. A little lower and I'll be the Caped Madwoman. He's flipped out. Yeah, I'm flipped, and you're out. Ha, ha, ha! Off I go, wearing my tight pajamas. (HUMMING) Hey, wait a minute, chief. Are you sure he's on our side? You bet, baby face. He was only a junior guard downstairs in the secret executive bathroom when he was recruited for a special service by the godfather of the J-Men himself, J. Eager Believer. Fear not, I am Shaboom. My name is-- All is known to me. Your name is Billy Batchit. I've got a file on you upstairs in my office. That is why you are here. Where are you coming from? Out of the john, my son. I operate from down here in the Privy Council with my hand on the handle waiting. There's harm to be done, and it should be your duty to see that the harmony continues even after my strong arms are gone. My duty? Yes, my son. All that is necessary is to repeat my code name. Shaboom. By its repetition, you will become the Caped Madman, and take on all the vises of the J-Men of the Secret Service. S for sneaky. H for hateful. B for bigoted. O for obnoxious. Another O for double obnoxious. And M for mean. Now, you little twerp, repeat the code word and become the man everyone yearns to be, the Caped Madmen. Shaboom! May the flush be with you! [toilet flushes] This is Barton calling the Caped Madman. Detroit is under attack by illegal music. Get down and investigate. It's the Caped Madman. I don't want to do any good. We've got to get out of here. We can't take the car. The motor dropped the rod. It's dropping on his rod. That'll fix the Caped Madman. Untie it. Where's that stupid music coming from? Uh-huh. Up there. Hey-yo! Come on, guys, this isn't the first engine we've lifted. Aha! Where is it? Aha! Boy, that music stinks. Now! Huh? Trying to unload a Buick on me with a Chevy engine, huh? Try recalling this! Whoa! You sadistic bastard! You crushed my skull. Whoa. Whoa. Oh, my head. One down, two to go. Hey-yo! What are you doing? Put me down. Meet you on the street, punk! [screams] I'm getting out of here. [inaudible] One more. Stop in the name of love! He sees me. He sees me. Oh, no. Oh. Oh. Hey-yo! I gotta get away. I gotta get away. Wait, elevator. Going down. Caped madman, everybody out. Nice shoes. Where is the Lightning Bug? Talk or I'll-- I'll talk. I'll tell you anything. Only let me go. All right. It's fun to abuse you. Let's go. Oh, this slinky silk costume feels so good against my naked body. And this will mean curtains for the Caped Madman. Smellfinger here, Mr. Lightning Bug. Ah, my faithful square nuts. You're just in time to see this horrible new weapon that just arrived from the moon. Looks like a bad case of the crabs, boss. (LAUGHS) It's not funny. But the joke this time is going to be on the Caped Madman. And all because of this. An incredible stereo system, that I specially designed to melt mines and walls. I call it a hot rock machine. And you'll see how hot the rocks are going to be at the secret broadcast cave this afternoon. I'm arranging a command performance for our friend, the Caped Crackpot. That squealer Owens will be sure to lead him there. (LAUGHS) Come on, come on, keep moving. What's the matter? I don't like this. Go ahead. OK, but I'd feel a lot better if you're still a Caped Madman. You sure got a lot shorter when you said that magic word. What's your secret? Elevator boots? Quiet, I've got a gun. A Caped madman doesn't need a gun, you little poopy butt. Shut up, or I'll I'll blow another hole in your head. All right, all right. Hello, boys. Come on in. Let me fix you a drink. A nice double for you, Owens, you double crosser. And for the shrimp, a cocktail, but just on track-- [both scream] Isn't that the pits? What's the matter, peewee, you forget the magic word? Shaboom! So, you're the Lightning Bug. Oh, you noticed. There's no mistaking you, bullet breath. Real camp. Yes, but I don't believe you expected me. On the contrary, Caped Madman, didn't you enjoy my little floor show? Why you lousy hood! You fool. With my advanced technological know how, and a degree in communications from the Lightning Bug School of Broadcasting, I'll soon be the boss jock of the world. (LAUGHS) Looks like I've turned the tables on you, madman. Right now, square nuts, turn on the machine, and blast it with a sound that's going to burn him down. Here it comes, madman. Hot rock, from your old friend, Uncle Melody. (LAUGHS) [rock music] This stinking music seems to be coming through this itty bitty wire. But that's impossible. Holy hot sauce! Somebody threw up in the cave. Louder! Louder! Cave or a grave. Uh-oh. I'm out of magic words. Hey-yo! [gurgling] What beautiful roses. We're in mourning as a witness to the death of the Caped Madman who recently lost his life. Caped madman? The Caped Madman should have a statue to his life. He's a statue already, perhaps against its will. [doorbell rings] That must be the man from the inhumane society. Excuse me. I hope I don't miss Leave it to Beaver. Right this way. Put it here, please. Now, if you bums would get out of here. Ah, blow it out your shorts, needle nose. Hmm, nice little doggie. As you can see gentlemen, this doggie, like many of our citizens, is in deep shock, because I purposely exposed him to massive doses of rock and roll. Gentlemen, the principle of my machines to generate a continuous wave of schmaltzy waltz time music, which could result in resuscitation of our people who are currently being rocked to death. We attached these little speakers to his tiny marbles. Of course, if that son of a bitch has been rocked a roll too long, I cannot expect success. [music playing] [dog whining] His eyes are open. Square music. This is just a weapon we J-Men need to combat this menace. It's unbelievable. I don't believe it. J-Men, I believe the experiment is a success. That's wonderful. A miracle. The mists are clearing away Mr. J-Man, and I see for you a life of tax free luxury and elegant uptown living. If you comply with our wishes. In other words, you want me to sell my country's secret plans to combat this rotten rock menace. Well, you can eat worms and die, sister. I'm a J-Man so-- nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nya! You use harsh terms, Mr. Burns. Nothing has been said of bribery. But that's not a bad idea. And if I'm not mistaken, wouldn't that mean for you to render us a slight service for which we are willing to pay. I'm going to have you wrapped in a US flag and burned personally by the president in high octane American gasoline. That is a fine patriotic plan, Mr. Burns. It is, however, not what I see coming up at the moment. Ow! Rubber spider venom. That's not fair. [buzzer beeps] Yeah? J-Man Sleevecoat to meet his new partner. Send him in. His partner, Burns, was just killed by a black widow. Intermarriage is difficult. How's it hanging, Coat? All right. Meet Juicy Withers, one of my bedtime regulars. She's recovering from a bad whipping I gave her. Hello, Miss Withers. How do you do it? This chick expects great things from you. We heard the report of your partner's sudden expiration. He was a wonderful drunk. He'd swallow a pitcher of beer. Well, I've got a pitcher of beer. Come on. See you later. I'll take my car. You can sit on the shift. [jazzy music] This is a good one, boys, it's real catchy. Now, listen up. If we can force everyone to listen to good music like this, we'll be able to defeat this rock and roll invasion in no time. Hold it. [? lang, ?] call the Golden Dragon and have them heat the Mandarin breakfast I ordered. Yeah. Now we'll write down the places where the records will play. Places, huh? Four Mandarin breakfast to go! [door shuts] That'll be easy. All right. OK. Here's where we'll kick it off. Elevators, banks, dentists, and massage parlors across America. Elevators, massage parlors-- Uh-huh. This will keep our people calm, safe, and happy. So here is your daily dose of government approved tunes from MUSAC, the military underground sugared airwaves command. Today, we have a special-- Sugary music, brother. I told you they'd be jamming us. But, Sombra, how can we prevent this MUSAC from being broadcasted? [clanging] What the [? frame ?] was that? Leave. It's the Lightning Bug from the moon. Ah, I don't get to see the new disguise. Come on, you know the rules. L for lightning. Roll up the rug. We are rocking and rolling, cause here comes the bug. Look at your boobs. Now look at me. The Lightning Bug says take five giant steps forward. What a wonderful disguise, LB. You bring us a message? I grow important, Sombra. This MUSAC that they play endangers my monster's plan for world conquest. We'll send out our rock and roll robots while I bomb this MUSAC back to the Stone Age. Excellent plan, oh, boss man. Now here are some smoke in your face to put you back into space. You send me, baby. Will Dr. Phil please report to the rock and roll victims treatment center? Dr. Phil, to therapy, please. I now want a strong man with nuts of steel. Oil, well. Nobody loves the metal man. Hello, rock and roll victims, time for your final does of R&R. [rock music] No, no. No more rock and roll, please. Here's the heavy metal sound that's going to put you underground. [man yells] (SINGING) I feel like a king in my flying wing. Did you accomplish what you wished, master? Yes, I got my head into this helmet. (LAUGHS) And now I'm ready to blow up the J-Men's MUSAC Center. We need more top 10 records, sire. Of course, my faithful worm. I'll get you everything you need, because we're going to totally annihilate their counteroffensive with my top 10 ton torpedo. It'll be the biggest smash this country has ever seen, if you know what I mean. No. And I'm certainly glad that you don't. (LAUGHS) You know, worm breath, this is the kind of day that I normally take out the wing and bomb people, but it's my job, know what I mean? Besides, it's the only time I get to wear my Darth Vader costume. Prepare the radio for my pirate broadcast. Hello, folks, this is the bug, you dug-- I mean, you dig? Yeah, I'm the Lightning, and here's a hit that's frightening, and I'm dedicated to those bean bags working at the J-Man's MUSAC command. Here comes the song, and you'll soon be gone. It's going to be a smash. Be over in a blast. So long, trash. (LAUGHS) Hey. That sound. What is that thing? Oh, my God. It's an all electric house. Those J-Men are inside. I'm going to get them. No, don't. Oh. I'm going. I'm going. Stop! The music is killing me! Poor Corporal Lou. It's going to be a terrible shock when I report this to General Electric. Turn that thing on, sweetheart. Keep your shirt on, Sleeve. Attention J-Men, this is the chief. The Federal MUSAC Center was destroyed this evening by deadly electrical music. In response, our top military brass brains are now in an all night session working on a counterattack. That is all. Yeah, at this time, I don't think we should question the National Guard as to whether bombs should be used. The bombing by the guard, as well as chemicals could-- could be in this game of war. I'm supported by the far right. Big business in the right would love to sell us chemicals. Oh, this bullshit is getting us nowhere. Recessions are deadlier than any of the weapons we're talking about. Frank, let's get something going. Let's get some J-Girls over. I'll go phone that blonde fox. What's her name? Juicy, that's it. Oh, no. The chief's locked us in and I didn't bring my blankie. How do you do? You come to Sombra to learn of the future? We're interested in this ass, not the future. I'll handle this, Miss Withers. I was wondering if a witch like you could give me a secret word that would turn me into a superhero like him, so I could wipe out this rock and roll. I'm afraid you're just not the type. I'm sorry. I think you charge too much. I suggest you dye your underwear and learn to live within your limitations. Up yours. Bitch. I told you this was an asinine idea, but would you listen to me? No. Oh, can it, Juicy. That was too close for comfort. I better slip out of this girdle and catch the bug. Ten for the moon, you'll be here soon. (COUGHS) Burning oil. Welcome, oh, Lightning Bug. Take eight giant steps forward. Master, your illegal broadcasts of rock and roll are not enough to destroy America. Look at the headlines. [? yanks ?] web pirates. I see what you mean. Then it's time for my other secret weapon, drugs. Yes, the bugs and the drugs. My boys will cop the weed we need, and soon the world will go to pot. Are you ready to make that deal, [? sheepdick? ?] I don't know. I don't believe our people threshold should be exported, white man. You honkies, don't know how powerful it is. One puff can hit you like a hammer. Oh. He'll get your hash oil now. Try to keep your stash to yourself. Well, put that in your pipe and smoke it. I love this convertible sofa. Stay high. The hash oul is ours, [inaudible].. I know, Mueller. We were down here getting stoned, and we heard everything that Sheep said. How about that? Got to hang on to this diamond roach. Come on, let's contact the castle and get the hash oil to America before the [inaudible] J-Men find out. Two [inaudible] J-Men to see you, governor. Hmm. Touch your head. Governor LaCombe, what do we have to say is private. Wait in the damn hall. OK, I can listen through the door anyway, Tommy. My name is Pierre Duran. I am a French pederast. Hmm. And you? My friend prefers to be known only as Spice Water. Spice water? Don't you just love his tight [? no ?] drag? Who does your leather hair? I've traced the source of contraband hash oil movements to this island. I'm convinced it's being shipped to America under orders from a hooded hood called the Lightning Bug. Oh, gentlemen, this is incredible. Do you realize how butch you two look together? We are even prepared to prove that some of your troops are growing marijuana in window boxes. Marijuana? Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mhm. Tough guys, huh? We'll see how tough they are. How'd you like this beat, Flyswatter? I love your lashes. Come on, I'll give you the back beat. But I hate your taste in music. Oh. Different strokes for different folks. Release him. Welcome, Spice Water, to the hot Hitler disco where the beat never gestapos. And, listen, if we can't spring some info from you, we make you listen to Donna Summer all winter till you fall. Anything but that. Now will you admit you're just a smart ass agent for the United States, J-Man? No. Get his hairdresser, Duran. [speaking german] Oh, now we see [inaudible]. Touch your hair! Hey, Duran, do you want to watch me cover your friend's neck with hickeys? Tell him nothing, Duran. All right. We're assigning you the pleasant duty of blow drying his hair away, or we put your nuts in curlers. What do you say, frog face? You see my position. You wanna get the firing squad ready? Touch your head. [drumming] Do you want to blow your nose? Uh-uh. OK. Firing squad, get loaded. It's a shame, but it's his ass or mine. Fire! [gun fires] One less J-Man to bug the bug. Easy, men. Don't mess his hair. I spent hours on it. Open your eyes, Sleeping Beauty. I'm sorry that I had to tie your hands, but my hands were tied. I realize that. Some of your men shots so close, I thought I would crap. I [inaudible]. Did you arrange for my passage to America? Yes. You will be airmailed into Lisbon, then you'll be flown northwest to New York, where you will be placed in a box marked poisonous reptiles and snake your way across the country to a fantastic fun filled debriefing date with veteran J-Man Admiral Ballzy, your Beverly Hills host in fabulous Los Angeles. Oh, these rock and roll demonstrations are killing me. Oh. Admiral Balzy, it's Spice Water. Swati, where's your tight uniform? Oh, look, get your hands off him, Miss Fluff and Fold. Excuse my secretary, but we all heard about your close encounter at the castle. What's the latest dope? They do call it dope. I brought some of it here with me in this very briefcase. I traced it to an abandoned warehouse in Downey. I was being closely followed by one of the bug's men, but I pretended not to notice them. I couldn't hear anything because of my close fitting helmet, but I could observe clearly that the bug's men were pressing the hash oil into bricks, which they obviously planned to throw at the police. We need protection from this evil. I think I'd better send out absolutely every operative in my department. Right, sir. I wanna take you child and hold you in the midnight hour. Well, my man with a cooking can, get any high octane marriage or hoochie from this crude hash oil? Yes, sir. With the Arabs aide, I was free to devise a new and more sinister process, and we'll soon have enough reefer for any purpose. Good. We can continue to roll them in a little cigarettes and pass them out to the students forever. Bug, Bug. Mr. Lightning Bug, sir, we've got a problem. What are you doing here, goon? I waited at the give-away car at the University to hand out joints, but the cops came out. Professors, radicals, and the girls were digging and getting off, so I had to beat it. You continue to beat it, you go blind, goon. So the cops are giving us the bird, huh? Well, we've got a little bird of our own. You'll get us back on campus, and then I can get back to the moon. Where's my Italian disguise? Hey, Officer Geek. You like to have a sexy with my Bird, Beaky, again, today, huh? No, not today, Tony. Oh, come on. Don't you love this little pecker anymore? I love you. A parser and a peck. A peck around your neck'll do. Ouch! But, Officer, Beaky, Beaky tells me you're some great animal lover. You tired of pulling my little bird? What do you want, the police dog? All right, move on. All right, boss, all right. Come here, Beaky. Come here. Officer Geeky no love you no more. Beaky and Geeky, we're sweethearts. [inaudible] Yeah, come on. Come on, men, get those reapers on campus before the big game. Come on. Come on. All right. All right. Great work, Lightning Bug. We'll see that everything's moving according to plan. All good, boys. Shorty, this is Sombra. Move in! We can't hear. Closer. OK, I'm moving. Can I help you? Mm-hmm. Was this cigarette made here? Oh, this isn't a cigarette. It looks like some kind of weed. Been finding these strange butts all over the campuses. Can you tell me what it is? [sniffing] A-sheesh! Worth $1,000. A-sheesh flower powder, eh? We know where to look next. Hmm. El Bugs flower shop, and there were potted plants in the window. This could be the place. May I help you, miss? I'm from the local J-Men's office. I have some hash extract we're trying to identify in a marijuana investigation. Uh-oh. I'm sorry, miss. I'm afraid I won't be able to help you. Oh. Holy shit, that's expensive stuff. I see you do know the price of getting stoned. Aha. You fooled me, all right, but it isn't going to do you any good. Get in there, clumsy bimbo. Who's going to clean this up? People'll be tracking hash all around here all day. OK, this is your last chance to talk. All right, all right, I'll tell you everything. What do you want to know? So you won't talk, huh? Start the machine. You beast! What do you want? Code names, passwords, my phone number? Still won't talk, huh? Look at that blade, baby. It slices, dices, peels, breaks, and chops. I'll talk. Look. Untie me. I'll write it all down. That was your last chance, sister. That's what they get when they won't talk. I better phone the bug and let him know. What's the area code for the moon? No more Mr. Nice Guy. Now's the time to end this annoying interference by myself. Send off the hash missile. We've got the kids hooked. Now, we'll bomb all of LA. (LAUGHS) Everything starts there, it might as well end there. (LAUGHS) Calling J-Men King. Calling J-Men King. Hash missile sighted. Target: Los Angeles. Disregard personal feelings about the city and intercept. A jet propelled joint. This is my chance to use the atom jacket. Hope my tailor didn't forget the lead lining. Ah. There it is now. Let's see, I'd better duck back in that alley. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to be some fun tonight. Mmm, I love the fake smell of real [inaudible].. This special mask should protect me from the smog. Now, rocket jocks rules of order. Look both ways before taking off. All clear. Now let's see. I want to turn on. I want to go up. And I want to go fast. I hope this works, or I'll run into my car. Oh, my God, I'm flying! Hope I don't get airsick. If I heave in this helmet, I'll drum. Uh-oh, better not get too close. That's a 10 kilo warhead. Twinkle twinkle hash hit missile, you are no match for my ray pistol. Wow, what a hit of hash! I'm crashing! Whoa! Wow, lucky. Are you the automatic pilot I ordered? No way. I'm blind as a bat in this bucket, but, say, cutie, this high won't last forever. What do you say we go down together? No dice, chrome dome Hey. Aww. There goes a nice parachute. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This hash makes me feel like I'm flying. What a trip. Boy, am I hungry! This meeting is now called to order, J-Men. As you know, we've selected J-Man King to combat this rock and roll and drug conspiracy. Here's my plan to force the Bug's extermination. Professional rock and drug hunters must be commissioned to annihilate these pirate broadcasters and dope smugglers once and for all. We'll call it Operation Interrupt. And we'll use our very best J-Men to guarantee its success. The air assault against the dope fiends will be led by our flying ace in the hole. Yes, we're putting our duke up. He knows how to handle any John or Jane who's driving around with a roach in their roadster. And our rock and roll attacks will be coordinated by our new commissioner of culture, Puke Earwax. He knows that the Bug's pirate station could be hidden in the innocent looking farmhouse. A suspiciously innocuous orphanage. The inconspicuous summerhouse. Whatever the cost, we'll stop him. Underwater. On the water. And using our most sophisticated weaponry, in the air. And on the ground. We'll blast this menace off its tracks. Our fearless J-Men will deliver our message to the enemy's doorstep. There'll be no place to hide. No door too sturdy. And as a last resort, we'll defoliate every forest and park and incinerate every private garden, balcony, and window box to assure us that this marijuana menace will never take root here again. Well, looks like we finally got everything under control at last, Barton. Right, chief. Sure it was expensive. Billions worth of land, vehicles, and structures destroyed, and thousands of so-called innocent victims. But it was worth it, chief. You bet. 'Cause now we can sit back, put up our feet, and relax. [phone rings] [screams] I'll get it, chief. You certainly will, Barton. J-Men Barton here. Identify yourself. I have access to friends that the United States men must see. I'm a Tibetan scientist phoning from the moon. That's why the reception is bad. I have a crank call, chief. Yeah, buddy, go on. The field behind this plot is an alien. I was kidnapped by this man, and I had to teach him all I know. He made me tell everything and-- Aha! Making personal calls on my line? Lightning Bug-- The lightning strikes. (LAUGHS) Now that you're dead, you're usefulness to me has ended, but I'll keep your shoes. Hello? Hey, chief, I think we were cut off. Cut off? Give me that phone. Hello, operator? Listen, we were just cut off in the midst of a hot tip. I want to make sure we weren't charged for that call. Wait a minute. There's something wrong with this phone. Barton, what do you think? I don't think, Chief. That's why I'm a J-Man. Good thinking. Thank you, chief. What was that tip? Oh, it was nothing. That kook just said something about aliens being behind the whole thing. Aliens? Sure. Listen, Mexicans and Canadians are always a problem. Next thing you know, they're going to be blaming it on little guys in shiny suits from outer space. (LAUGHS) Lunar, aren't we supposed to be on the ground by now? Yes, Moondog, but we can't find a place to park. There's a nice spot. On the right. Hey, this place looks like the moon before we developed it. I'll buy a lodge here after the war. Here we go. Hang on to your moon rocks. Nice landing, Lunar. Well, that flight went will. Take out the hash gas. Yes, sir. We'll double park next to their ship. Hey, you arrived just in time, Moondog. The J-Men got us stuck in a drug traffic jam, and we need something new to fry their brains. Got just what you expected. Help us transfer it to the truck quickly. Go unload this hash gas before they ticket us. It's a 10-minute zone. Hey, ain't that Leonard Nimoy? No, no. Can't see his ears. Calling the Bug. [inaudible] the hash gas has landed. We have taken a giant step for all moonkind. There is Los Angeles where the air is so bad, they'll never know we're polluting them with hash gas. And mixed with the power of pop music and pot shall finally enslave them a horrible dictator. Prepare the Earth hostages for my pleasure. Yes, your Bug-ship, the old man is in the hash can. Then hash 'em, and the girls next. I love what hash gas does to earthlings, especially the girls. You heartless devil! That's me, all right. Gas 'em. (LAUGHS) It's primo [? lunanese. ?] You beast! Now watch carefully, my dear, as your father's entire lifestyle changes before your very eyes. You evil monster. You're killing him. Only part of him. Daddy, daddy! Oh, my God. His eyes are glazed and his tie is shrunk. Principal Straight Sucka. No school today. We're playing with our peepees. A famous high school disciplinarian, now a burned-out shuffling hash-head. Yes, master, my head is full of hash. My ears are full of music. Feeling good. Excellent. And even now my agents on Earth are passing out the gas. (SINGING) Moon agents passing out the gas. (LAUGHING) How are you doing, J-Cap? Have a cigar? Oh, thanks. Good, good. [choking] Dropping out. Oh, boy. My daily dose of J-Man MUSAC. Hmm. Louis Primo and the Maui Wowie. Haven't heard of them. [music playing] Hey. Uh-huh. [coughing] Wow! Hawaii, goodbye. It's not something you ate, Admiral Ballzy. Can you dig it? I dig you. This is the Lightning Bug speaking. Calling the tune from the moon, and we're going to enslave you. Far out. Have you any defenses left? A secret missile in the research lab. Fine. I'll send a robot to take care of it. Here, fart face, a little whiff on me. Admiral Balzy Admiral Balzy. Ow. What happened to you, sir? Piss off. He looks like he's been drugged. He's been hashed. Admiral Balzy, you've got to remember. What did that madman want from you? Why don't you square just cool it? I only hipped him to our secret mission lab in town. Oh, my God. I hope I can warn them in time. Moondog, Bug here. Nice coaster. Thanks. Look, these dirty Earth clods are working out a bomb to blow my ass off. Send R2ScrewU down to the lab. Go in there already. I see the robot in the corner. Hi, tuts. Chief wants to know how the secret bomb's coming, Professor. It's a secret, J-Man. OK, I'll just snoop around then. Here we go. The coffee machine Oh, way, Hoover. Out of the way, fudge face. I want the bomb. Have a [inaudible], you brute. I want that bomb and no trouble. [inaudible] Oh, this stuff is too strong. Look out! Ow! [inaudible] Come on, give me the bomb! The bomb! The bomb! The bomb! The bomb! How can I help? French kiss him, hair net. It'll short him out. Can I just pour a Coke on his joing? No. Give me the bomb. [inaudible],, give us a hand with this tin can. Ha-ha! Hope that my man runs my brain, but it will never hurt me. Push him back. Push him back. Way back. Hey, throw the switch, Miss. OK. There. So long, tin man. Ow! Ow! Ow! We're moving this entire operation to the defense dungeon. [robot malfunctioning] Defense dungeon, huh? Got a little surprise for you, Juicy. Yeah, what is this? It's a dildo-nator, and it'll activate our new anti-bug bomb. Mhm. It works. Yeah, it'll blow that lousy lightning to smithereens. So let's go. We're supposed to meet Admiral Balzy at the defense dungeon. Put it in a safe place until we get there. Hmm. Calling J-Man Kink. UFO sited in vicinity of defense dungeon. Please investigate. Hmm, let's see. There it is. Aha! Faulty muffler. Naughty, naughty, bad polluter, bring you down with my ray shooter. Was that a flat? We've been hit, sir. Prepare to crash! How do you prepare for a crash? Hope I can stop this soon in time. Oh, my arches. Hey there, rocket jockey. Sorry I had to bring you down, but your catalytic converter isn't working. Say, aren't you Leonard Nimoy? I'm the space man from the moon. The moon? The Lightning Bug's based on the moon? Yeah, I think. And we're going to steal your bomb. That's what you think, moon goon. I'm going to tell the chief. Let's see. On, up, and super fast. Where's my springboard? Ah, there it is. Ow, my shoes are on fire. Ah! Sleeve, Juicy. Brought the dildo-nator for the weapon. That means we're ready to blow up the bug. We'll install it later. Better go move the rocket now. Is it ready to go? All except the tail assembly. We'll pack it later. Well, hurry with it. We'll get a piece of tail in the back while you're finishing. Remember, you bomb the snatch. I'll snatch the bomb and the other guys and the robot will take care of any J-Men that drop in. Red alert! Red alert! This is the chief. All J-Men report immediately to defense dungeon. Prepare for combat. That is all. That's enough. I'll be glad to get out of here. This cave is rather confining. You'll get used to it. Oh, no, Bug thugs. Tie 'em up. Wait a minute, fellas. Don't forget you're talking to Sleeve Coat. Swell cave. When the war's over, this will make a great pick-up bar. Uh-oh. Put 'em up, bug slug. Roll with this rock, Lone Star. Ow! Must be Happy Hour. Swinging single, huh? Hey, can I buy you a round, big boy? Well, here comes a landing. Oh. There goes another new pair of shoes. Fee-fi-fo-fum. I smell the blood of a J-Man. Uh-oh, an enraged water heater. I don't want to dance with you. I'll pick my own partner. Well, pick this. I'll just leap on this creep. Did you hear the one about the robot and the pole? Seriously. I am programmed to kill you. [inaudible] Look out! Move your tail, Coat! [robot speaking] Dirty J-Men! Ah! Darn, moon goon, take this. Fee-fi-fo-fum. [inaudible] Hey, you dance pretty good. Here's a new step for you, Lone Star. Get down. Yah! My knee! The gun, Juicy, get the gun. Shoot him, Juice. Him, not me. Oh. Oh, shit. You mean what? It what? She what? They what? He, she, they, it, what what, Barton? Admiral Ballzy's in the hospital with a concussion. Yes? Colonel King was decapitated by a robot. Go on. Sleeve Coat was shot to death accidentally by one of our own female agents. And? The Lightning Bug's thugs got away with a rocket bomb we were going to use to blow up the moon. Win some, lose some. Barton. There is nobody left but us. We have got to get our heads together. Barton, sit down. So they stole our rocket bomb for the moon, huh? Well, we're going to have to blast them out the old way. Rosemary, give me the Navy, and step on it. Warships at sea and on land. This is a directive from the chief of the freight J-Men. We are at war with the moon. Look to the sky and fire when you see the white in its eye. Good luck. Fire when ready. Fire. Let's see. P-H-Y-R. These squares are trying to kill us. Turn on my giant hi-fi, and we'll rock them down in an hour. [music playing] Aim it at New York. Watch the Big Apple turnover. This is the mayor of New York City. We are under rock attack by hideous new waves of music from the moon. All residents are requested to flee mindlessly while members of the police's fire departments will assemble in their union halls for contract negotiations. This is a recording. And the mayor city's first citizen. First citizen out of the city. I can be the mayor of New Jersey, Atlantic City. What's that? Oh, my God. Looks like I'm gonna be the mayor of Atlantis. [screams] That's power of my amp. I built it from a kit. Turn it up. All the way to 10. That's a lot of electricity. Are you questioning my power, Mooney? But, Buggy, you may overload the tubes and blow our ass to Mars. Turn it up I said. It's happening! I love it! That's rock and roll! Eat it up! Blow it out! Let's boogie! Turn it up. More juice, Bruce. Bug, you're mad. The moon is being destroyed. You don't know good music when you hear it. Look out, look out! All right, more. Check out this jam. Now this is what I call getting stoned! That's all over now. The moon base has been destroyed, taking the Lightning Bug and all his henchmen with it. And New York City has been wiped off the face of the Earth. A double victory. That's super, chief. But look at all the men that we lost. The Caped Madman, Rocket Jock, Spike, Sleeve Coat, the Lone Star, and Claire and Lance. Lost? (LAUGHS) (COUGHS) Chief, are you all right? Oh. Of course, I'm all right, Barton. So are they. But, chief, that's impossible. Barton, haven't you learned anything from this? J-Men know how to survive. We're invincible. And what's the secret? Flexibility. When we get in a really tight spot, Barton, we don't resist, we just go with it. That's what we're going to do. J-Men. Forever, chief. [upbeat music] Lucky. [upbeat music] Or is it, J-men? [laughing]
