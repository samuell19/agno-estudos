[BIRDS CHIRPING] [TRACTOR ENGINE RUMBLING] [PIANO MUSIC FADES IN] [LIGHT GUITAR STRUMS] [INSPIRING VIOLIN MUSIC] [MUSIC FADES OUT] [TRACTOR ENGINE RUMBLES] [ENGINE SHUTS OFF] [TRUCK ENGINE STARTS] RYAN: Hey! Andy, What are you doing? ANDY: Moving your truck. Why? It was in my way. Could've asked me first. Could've parked on your side. COLLETTE: Ryan, Trash! Hi Andy! [WRENCH RATCHETS] Oh boy. Hello George. Jeremy. Oh, hi Andrea. How're you doing? Fine, Mr. Davis. How's school going? It's July. Ah... right. You helping grandpa out a little? 'Round the farm? She's just about running things. Well, I need to talk to you about a couple finance things, George. [TRACTOR RUMBLES TO A START] (in Spanish) JAIME: How many picking crews do you need? (in Spanish) GEORGE: Only one this year. (in Spanish) Just one? For the whole orchard? (in Spanish) Yes. [TRACTOR ENGINE APPROACHES] (in Spanish) Hello Andy! (in Spanish) ANDY: Hello Jaime! (in Spanish) Miguel wants to know if you'll marry him. [WHISPERS] Jaime. (in Spanish) He's better looking than you. Smarter too. (in Spanish) Glad you've noticed. (in Spanish) See? she likes you. (in Spanish) JAIME: Ok, (in Spanish) We'll find your crew and talk soon. (in Spanish) See you later! Bye. What'd Jeremy want? Oh, you know those bankers. Just something about tax returns and property benefits. How's the forklift? I think it's the carburetor. I'm gonna fix it after I take my nap. It's a wonder we get any work done. I sure am glad you're here, to take care of this place. It's gonna be a good year. Sure it is, Grandpa. [ATV REVS TO LIFE] [MUSIC FADES IN] KATE: Hey! I'm bored. Mike's at work. Wanna check sprinklers with me? Can I drive? Okay, and so then Meghan, who'd been planning the senior party all along broke up with him 'cause she wanted to be with Rick, and so now Caleb is throwing his own party and Jess told me he wants to have it down by the creek and have like a fire and stuff. STOP! My point is you should come! ANDY: You invited? KATE: Ryan's invited so it's like we're invited. Come on! I wanna go and we both know Ryan will get in trouble without us and I don't want to babysit him all night. Besides, you need to get out more, have some fun. I'll think about it. I saw this dress downtown that would look so good on you. We can go tomorrow. I'm busy tomorrow. You can take a day off. No I can't, harvest is - Harvest, ooh... KATE: I swear you'd pay more attention to me if I was a tree. ANDY: Probably. [MUSIC ENDS ON CELLO CHORDS] And then he took her to all the places that they went on their first date. My mom totally cried. KATE: God, I cannot wait until stuff like that happens to me. I want to go to Italy first, it looks so romantic. ANDY: Send me postcards, [TRUCK APPROACHES] KATE: Look who it is! KATE: Hey Ryan! Hey! RYAN: What are y'all doing? Why do you always park in my way? That forklift never works. Why don't you just get a new one? 'Cause unlike you, I can fix things. Ouch. Nah, she loves me. RYAN: Farm girls just aren't in touch with their emotions. You live on a farm too, dumbass. Ignore her, she's being difficult. Hey, are you going to the senior bonfire next week? Yeah, probably. You want to come? Ryan! I'm shocked that you would just assume such a thing. KATE: But yeah, absolutely. You too, Andy? Nah. KATE: She's being stubborn. RYAN: Andy? Stubborn? You gonna get out of my way? You sure you're big enough to drive that thing? [FORKLIFT STRUGGLES TO A START] I stand corrected. [FORKLIFT MOTOR POWERS UP] Andy! STOP! Andy! Andy, it was just a joke, seriously, knock it off! Damn it, Andy! You are incapable of normal social interaction. [GIGGLES] [PUMP ENGINE ROARS] [PUMP STRUGGLES THEN DIES] ANDY: Pump's dead again. Can't get it going. We should really get a new pump. Yeah, and tractors with AC. I'll show you how to fix it in the morning. Dinner! Grandpa! Grandpa, wake up, dinner's ready. Grandpa? Grandpa? Grandpa. [PHONE RINGING] LINDA: Undercooked? It's already a piece of charcoal. Look, I'm just telling you what he told me. Microwave it. [PHONE RINGING] Should've given it to Susan, she's got an exquisite talent for burning things. Okay, why don't you come over here and I'll show you how to make an asshole brûlée, asshole. Answer the goddamn phone! Her majesty Chef Linda Stone's royal kitchen, how may I help you? What? What? Your father's dead. LUC: They wanna know what to do about your niece. [DISTANT SIREN] Your grandfather seems to have suffered a cardiac event. [VOICE FADES INTO RINGING] His heart likely gave out under stress... [EAR RINGING] Linda, you're here. Where is she? She's in George's room. I'm sorry about your father. First your sister, now this, I... don't know how the two of you cope. Hey. I'll be right outside. [SAD PIANO CHORDS] [DISTANT VOICE READS EULOGY] PASTOR: I'm so sorry for the loss of your grandfather Andy. He was so lucky to have you around. [SAD PIANO CHORDS] I'm really sorry Linda. You know I always respected your father. Thank you, Daniel. Hey. Look, I know this situation isn't - (in Spanish) Hello, hello! Hi! (in Spanish) Hello! (in Spanish) How are you? (in Spanish) Look, Mom. (in Spanish) Put it there. (in Spanish) Help me with this please. (in Spanish) Hun, do you want to eat something? Look at how skinny you are! (in Spanish) Mom, where do I put this? [METAL CLANKING] Ugh. I swear to God! Maybe you should take a break? Your aunt's car is really... Pretentious? I was gonna say fancy, but that too, I guess. She has nice hair. Do you want to talk about stuff? Nuh-uh. (ON PHONE) LINDA: I think I'm almost done here. Great, we're dying down here, we need you. She wants to live with the neighbors. (ON PHONE) LUC: Great problem solved! She's hardly said two words to me since I got here. Look, I'm sure you'll figure it out. I'll be back this weekend. And signing this will make you responsible for her personal and property interests. ANDY: What was that? Well, Linda will be in charge of everything your grandpa left to you. She can't have the farm, Grandpa gave it to me because she left! Andrea. LAWYER: You're required to have a guardian. Why? Well... you could petition for emancipation- How do I do that? Well, you'd have to show that being emancipated is in your best interest. LAWYER: I don't see a court very easily granting you emancipation. I really think you'll like it in San Francisco. What about Collette and Daniel? I could go be with them until I'm 18. LAWYER: Well, your aunt is willing and qualified to be your guardian. If you fight this, you're more likely to end up in foster care than you are being granted emancipation. ANDY: She's trying to take me to San Fransisco. I'm not going. Well of course you're not. Hey, Andy! How's your Aunt Linda doing? Fine, I guess? You know we were all really close in high school. DANIEL: She still living in the city? DANIEL: How's her restaurant going? RYAN, LET'S GO! RYAN: COMING! Would you... just tell her I said hi? Hey ma. You guys coming back for lunch, or you want me to take it out to you? Dunno. I'll see you later. [DISTANT CONVERSATION] (in Spanish) MIGUEL: Hello Andy. (in Spanish) How are you? (in Spanish) So so. (in Spanish) You are taking over the orchard? (in Spanish) Do I have a choice? (in Spanish) Look Andy, we found a picking crew, but they don't have any papers. (in Spanish) Everyone's gotta eat, right? (in Spanish) You sound like your grandpa. Hi. What're you doing here? Your aunt hired me to help you guys pack up. How come you didn't tell me you were leaving? I'm not. Hey. Where you been? Working. I spoke with Jeremy Davis from the bank, He said payments on the orchard have been overdue for months. Did your grandpa say anything about this? It'll be fine after we get paid for the crop. The farm hasn't made a profit in years. It's not your problem. We need to sell the orchard. No. I have to go back to the city, and you can't stay here by yourself. Yes, I can. Look, I'm sorry, but your grandfather was broke. Just because grandpa died doesn't mean you're in charge. He left the farm to me on purpose, he didn't want you here. And this isn't your home, stop packing. It's more complicated than that, Andy. It's about doing what's best for you. Do you really want to stay here forever? Why wouldn't I want to stay here? Grandpa was right, you just left because you're selfish. You need to start packing. It's not a choice. [DISTANT FRUSTRATION] [PUMP SPUTTERS] RYAN: Hey. RYAN: You want some help? ANDY: Nope. Let me take a look at it. You probably just need some more muscle- Stop treating me like I can't do anything! [LIGHT PIANO NOTES] [SAD CELLO] [KNOCK KNOCK] Andrea. Look at you! You're all grown up. Thanks for meeting with me. Anything for George Stone's granddaughter. I was real sorry to hear about his passing. Thank you. So what can I do for you? ANDY: Well I need to sell my crop. Really? I have 36 acres and can deliver 20 tons an acre for $500 a ton. And who's running his orchard now? I am. You? You seem real smart, but not even the best fruit is going for $500 a ton now. Well it's the best crop we've had in years. It's the best that I've ever seen. Look, you're young, and you're pretty. Don't waste your time trying to become a farmer. You're much better off trying to sell some of that land of yours and settling down. [PHONE RINGS] I really - Real sorry about your granddaddy. (INTO PHONE) Benhoff Fruit & Nut, this is Ron. LINDA: She likes slamming doors. Sounds like you. I used to be like that. Hated everybody and everything. What changed? Nothing. All she thinks about is payroll and that stupid pump. Just drag her out. [ROCK GUITAR FADES IN] ♫ Well I been working like a dog day afternoon and night ♫ ♫ I've been howling at the stars 'cause something isn't right ♫ ♫ I've got a bone to pick with this one ♫ ♫ And I've been chasing my tail ♫ ♫ It's a dog eat dog world and damn it isn't fair ♫ ♫ Don't tell me 'bout fa - a - air ♫ ♫ I said no, no, no ♫ ♫ I'm sick and I'm old and tired ♫ ♫ I said more, more, more ♫ ♫ The sun beat down like fi - i - ire ♫ [MUSIC ENDS ON GUITAR CHORD] [DISTANT CAR APPROACHING] I heard you and Andy aren't getting along so well. We're fine. Look, I know you never really wanted to be here. Look, I'm giving you another option Linda. Does Collette know you're here? You don't need to tie yourself down. You must be joking. She needs a family, Lins. Did it ever occur to you that not everyone wants to live the way you do? I'm just saying you don't have to do this. Andy doesn't want to leave why make her? We can help you. Both of you! Alright. What was that about? Nothing. What did he want? I can't understand how you can breathe in this place. LINDA: What the hell? LINDA: Where's the goddamn furniture? Sold it. You sold it? So you're coming to the city with me? No, I needed payroll money. Andy, we talked about this. You're not running the farm. You can't just sell everything we own. Well, it's my stuff, not our stuff. And we didn't talk about anything. Daniel was here to help, wasn't he? ANDY: You don't know me! [DOOR SLAM] [TRUCK PULLS UP] COLLETTE: What's wrong with it? It's filled with sand. Clogged the filter. I heard you were going to try and run harvest, on your own? Talk of the town I guess. Are you sure this is what you want to do? If you'd just let someone help you. Ryan would, if you just let him. Don't need him. [PUMP ROARS TO LIFE] [SPRINKLERS SPLASH] [DISTANT CONVERSATION] [TENSE GUITAR MUSIC] JEREMY: You guys have a good one. Have a nice happy hour. KATE: There's gonna be lots of people there to distract you, it'll make you feel better, I promise. Come on! You are such a robot. Hi, Ms. Stone. Linda is fine. What's going on? I'm trying to get Andy to come to this senior party tonight. Ryan Williams invited us. But it's like super safe, so no alcohol or anything. Oh yeah, I'm sure. I was thinking maybe, tonight would be a good night for Andy and I to watch a movie, hang out? I'll go. [HIP-HOP FADES IN] [PARTY CHATTER] You brought Andy! I'm impressed. I basically had to pull her off a tractor. Well I'm glad you did. MEGHAN! Nice dress. Can I get you a drink or anything? I'm good, thanks. Do you wanna, Do you wanna dance? Nah. Okay. (GIGGLING) Hey! Hey. Hey Mike. 'Sup? KATE: So, we're gonna go dancing. (distant) Yo, Wilson! MAHAFFIE? Do you wanna dance? RYAN: Sure, yeah, yeah! You okay? Just don't understand why you couldn't dance with Ryan. His feelings were really hurt, he wanted to dance with you. It's Ryan, it doesn't matter. He's probably thrilled you danced with him. He cares about you, Andy. You care about him too, you're just too stubborn to admit it. [CAR STRUGGLES TO START] How was the party? Fine I guess. I didn't know you were into Ryan. I'm not. But you went to the party to see him. No, Kate wanted me to go. What? Is that all? Why do you care? Andy, I lived here when I was sixteen too. I'm just saying, I think you can do more. Than what? Than marrying your neighbor and getting stuck in the same place for the rest of your life. ANDY: It was a party. I know, I'm just saying- ANDY: You don't like it here, I get it. No, I just think you need to look beyond this place. [DOOR SLAM] [SPRAY OF WATER] What'd you walk out here? Where's your ATV? Sold it. What do you want Jeremy? Your Aunt told me you're having a hard time coming to terms with selling the farm so... I thought I'd come down and talk to you about it. Not selling. The current economic landscape just doesn't allow for a single farmer to farm one farm anymore. Especially not a young girl, all by herself. It's all about critical mass and a globalized consumer market nowadays. Big words make you feel bigger, Jeremy? Just try to understand: that it's easier to farm pears in Argentina now where production costs are lower. Not everything is about money. But look at this as an opportunity to start something new! You have your whole life ahead of you. Why do you care? I don't want to see you suffer, Andy. There are going to be over a hundred new homes on this land in the next few years, and none of what you're doing here is gonna matter anymore. Is that how you can afford a new car? Andy, this isn't- You're turning this into a subdivision? Your grandfather would want you to benefit from this. JEREMY: OW! [UKULELE STRUMS] Really? SHERIFF: Hi Linda. Hello Sheriff. Sorry about your father. Good to see you again though. Mr. Davis said he was not going to press charges, so she's free to go. You going to keep acting like a child? I was defending myself. Have any free cells? Sure. You said I'm free to go. Not without a guardian's signature. See you in the morning sheriff. Fine! What were you thinking? That he's an asshole. That doesn't mean you can assault him. What if he had pressed charges? He wouldn't want everyone to know he got beaten up by a girl, so... You need to grow up. I need to grow up? I'm protecting everything Grandpa worked for. You're the one who ran away. That's not what happened. Andy, you're fighting a battle that was lost a long time ago. [CAR STOPS] You want to end up like Collette? Collette's a better person than you'll ever be. Andy! Move. Are you okay? I'm fine. What's going on? Nothing. Move! May I? Please? Ryan. Andy. Get out. Look, I know you can do it yourself, I'm just trying to help. So I hear you and your Aunt are having a hard time getting along. She said I'm being irresponsible and stubborn. I don't think you're being irresponsible- Says the boy who shirks all responsibility. Stubborn, on the other hand. I'm surprised your dad's gonna let you take over the farm at all. This is the first time I've seen you work all summer. What? I don't know. I don't really know if I wanna, do this, forever. You don't wanna to farm? I mean I should, right? I want a family. I want a house and all that. And I love this place, it's home. I just feel like there's gotta... there's gotta be something more for me. It's never really felt like, this is it, you know? You're doing that wrong. I got it. Andy wait! Andy I'm sorry. (ON PHONE) KATE: That's so romantic. No, Kate, it wasn't like that. (ON PHONE) KATE: What do you mean? I didn't like it. Okay, well, you'll get over that. What do you mean? I just mean I wasn't that excited about Mike at first, but he grew on me. That's insane, then you shouldn't be with him. Okay, then what should I do? Who should I be with? (ON PHONE) KATE: Cause I've got things figured out, I know what I want, it's to be with someone who wants me and not be alone like you and Linda. So, you're saying you want to marry Mike? I'm saying I want a life here after we graduate, I want a husband and kids, and I want to do that with my best friend. (ON PHONE) KATE: You could have these things if you'd stop being so stubborn. Well, I'm not you, I don't like that crap. Okay, that's a little judgey. Kate, okay, you know what I meant. Yeah, I know what you meant. (ON PHONE) KATE: You know, I always thought you were just like a little weird, but you think you're better than everyone else. Sorry my life isn't good enough for you. (ON PHONE) ANDY: Kate- [PHONE HANGS UP] Kate? LINDA: Let's go! I have to be at work in a few hours. You're coming with me. At least for the weekend. I'm not going anywhere. We're leaving in ten minutes. If you're not in the car, you can spend the weekend in lockup. Can I drive? [INSPIRING PIANO MUSIC] LUC: Hey finally. Hey, I'm Luc. Okay. What the hell's wrong with her? She's just pissed cause she didn't want to stop playing farmer and join the real world. Yeah, well I didn't want to run the kitchen by myself for the last week. Just stay out of the way. Susan, I need a salad for the four top! SUSAN: Two minutes chef! Chiffonade! You know why I work here? Her. She makes the goddamn world go around, and if you can't see that, it's your loss. But you're not gonna sit here and pout. LINDA: Luc! Where the hell are you? Coming, chef! LUC: And wash your hands! [GENTLE STRINGS FADE IN] Chef, twelve top reservation's here. Twelve top? Since when? Shit! I got so thick in the weeds, I forgot to clock it in. Goddamnit. Stall them. LINDA: Luc, find more filet! LUC: On it chef. LINDA: Andy, help Susan. Just do what I say. [MUSIC ENDS] Come on. So what'd you think? It was ok. You hungry? Yeah. Why did you leave? Dad sold my horse for a tractor. That's why you guys hated each other? We didn't hate each other. It was more than that. He bailed the orchard out with our college funds. Woah. Then he acted like nothing happened. He never talked to us. Plus, I knew if I stayed everyone would expect me to get married and have kids and I didn't want that, so... That's what Kate wants to do. What? Get married, have kids, the whole thing. Is that what you want? No... Sure, Collette seems pretty happy but... Collette got married when she was your age. I thought you guys graduated together. I finished a year early. She started dating Daniel a couple of weeks later, then she dropped out. Daniel said you and Collette and my mom were friends in high school. Daniel and I dated for three years. What? He wanted to get married. Then I left, and he married Collette a few months later. [JAZZ MUSIC] [SAXOPHONE SOLO] [JAZZ FADES OUT] Morning. Morning. It's not what I thought. You don't sound ready to move in. I need to go back. It's not just about Grandpa. Everyone else thinks they know what I want, and they don't. Everyone wants you to be their version of you. Where does your restaurant get it's produce? Mostly wholesalers. Benhoff Fruit & Nut already turned me down. Your mom used to call it Benhoff Fruitface & Nutjob. Go around him. You won't make any money off him anyway. How? MANAGER: We're not looking for new produce suppliers. You should be. Oh yeah? The fruit you have on display is scabby, rotting and were never properly ripened, so yeah, I'd say so. If you don't refrigerate Bartletts before you put them on display they turn mushy when they ripen. Your current supplier left out a step. We, on the other hand, can guarantee ripe fruit deliveries weekly. No thanks. We can also beat your current supplier's price by twenty five percent. You're paying what, eighty, eighty-five cents a pound? We can do sixty. How about fifty? I bet Freddy across the street would jump on this. Okay, okay. I'll need fifty percent up front. Fine.

How can we help you? Unfortunately, the bank has decided in moving forward to seizing George's assets. You have a week to vacate the property. What? Sorry. It's the board's decision, it's out of my hands. Oh, that's bullshit. This is because of your development deal- Andy! I'll finish harvest before then, and you'll get your money. [GRINDING METAL] RYAN: Hey! Andy! [GRINDING STOPS] Hey. Hi. Look, um... about... the other night. Andy, I know... everything with your grandpa dying, Sorry, that's... I just, Look Andy... Jesus Christ Andy, I... Alright, look. You can act like I'm just the jerk who lives next door, that you don't remember us growing up together, but I'm not... I'm not gonna to forget. I know you, pretend not to care. I mean we've known eachother our whole lives, I just... don't wanna lose that. [LADDER FALLING] WORKER: AAHH! (in Spanish) MIGUEL: Help! (in Spanish) MIGUEL: I think it's broken. (in Spanish) We should take him to a hospital. (in Spanish) Yes. (in Spanish) JAIME: No, no, no. (in Spanish) You need a doctor, Jaime. ANDY: Hi, we think his arm might be broken. Fill out the paperwork, bring it back when you're done. NURSE: Does he have papers? He needs help, he needs a doctor. What's the problem? His arm is hurt. Doctor, he needs to be checked in first. Come with me. (in Spanish) LINDA: How are you, Jaime? (in Spanish) JAIME: I'm fine, but it's dislocated. Andy, I really need to talk to you. Where is everyone? Jeremy called immigration. What? Are they okay? Everyone's safe. It was just a scare tactic. I'm gonna kill him. (in Spanish) I'm sorry Andy. If I hadn't gotten hurt, maybe- (in Spanish) ANDY: It's not your fault, Jaime. (in Spanish) We can't harvest a hundred tons in a week. He's right. There has to be a way to fix it. What way? There's what 200 tons left? We can't do that. I'm pregnant. Wait, what? Kate. I mean, it's a bit sooner than I wanted to have kids but... I'm almost 18, so it's not that big of a deal, right? Andy? Did you tell Mike? So a few weeks ago after our fight, I was so mad... And Ryan texted me and I was talking to him about it... And then we were hanging out, and... ...yeah. I just need someone to be happy. Give me a minute. [SAD PIANO MUSIC] Andy, what are you doing? Packing. So that's it? What happened to sticking up for what matters? You win too, you should be thrilled. Ok, so Jeremy is a prick. Kate's pregnant. And apparently she's keeping it. And it's Ryan's. Does it ever stop? No. Not really. It's suffocating. You think I don't wanna punch Jeremy? I almost shot Daniel's father once. He saw me driving tractor during harvest and said I should go back to the kitchen. So I shot dad's 20 gauge into his engine block. It doesn't stop, but you learn to deal with it, because if you don't, they win. Come on. [HOPEFUL PIANO KEYS] COLLETTE: Wow! [INSPIRING WOODWINDS] [LONE CLARINET NOTE] LINDA: Three more trees? Thank you. [CAR DOOR SLAM] What's wrong? Ryan loves you, Andy. Kate, I don't want to- I know! That is the worst part! You have him. Right in front of you and you don't even... Do you have any idea what I would give for that? I told him. About... He wants me to get rid of it. He says that it's my fault? And that I'm crazy for trying to- [MUFFLED CRYING] It's not your fault. It's not your fault. [LONE CELLO NOTE] [JOYFUL PIANO CHORDS] Coffee? No time. Bank opens in thirty minutes. VICTOR: Thank you again. You're welcome. Oh hey, Andy, good to see you. Victor, this is the young lady who's land you just purchased. Here's your money, Jeremy. Andy, you're too late. Mr. Thompson now owns your land. This is your money, I'm paying off all my debts. Pleasure doing business with you. You too, Victor. Thank you very much, absolutely. Andy, you no longer owe the bank money. Matter of fact, we owe you money. There's a check in my office here for you. No. The bank only took what is legally ours, you get the rest. You couldn't have waited for me to sell my crop? Banks do that for farmers all the time! Your cut was over five hundred thousand dollars. That's a lot of money. I mean, you should celebrate! The entire valley is being developed. The Miltons, the Eriksons, the Williams, they all have sold their land. The Williams didn't sell! Daniel and Collette didn't sell. Yeah they did. Two days ago. Andy, it's just business! RYAN: Hey! WHAT THE HELL? Andy, calm down, calm down! You didn't tell me! Didn't tell you what! About the bank! About what you did to Kate! Andy that's not what you think. Oh, don't tell me what I should think. You sold out, and you hurt her! We all just made a lot of money on this deal. You think I care about money? You won't have to do all this work anymore. You can actually have a life with me! Andy, I want to be with you. I'm sorry but I did this to take care of you. I never asked you to. Andy, come on. Andy please I'm sorry, Andy! Just let me explain you'll understand- [TIRE HISSES AIR] ANDY WHAT THE HELL? This was always gonna happen Andy this is good for us!

I don't know. Well, you have to send us postcards. DANIEL: She slashed a hole in my son's tire! LINDA: And he deserved it! That girl's put everything she has into this place. None of you could have even mentioned you were going to undermine that? What happened to she needs a family? What are you talking about? You left! You don't care about family! I chose to leave! She doesn't get that choice anymore. What, you think I want the subdivisions and the strip malls and the highways? I have been watching them get closer my entire life. There's nothing we can do.
