THE TREASURE OF CANTENAC This work was produced at Photosonor Studios in Courbevoie Then it was fully developed at Eclair Laboratories in Epinay-sur-Seine and it's a film by... Come in. Rene Genin, priest of Cantenac, and Roger Legris, village idiot. How are they? - Very amazing. Very surprising? Well, my God... Gentlemen, please. You're well, Mr. Sacha Guitry? - Until proven otherwise, yes. Do you have time to make a movie? - We always have half an hour ahead. Well, sir... I find your story fascinating, to the extent that... Hello, miss? Would you like to send me a complete crew? Yes, yes, right away. Thank you. Mr. Fernand Rene. I'm the village drunk. You see what you have to do. Ladies, please. Mrs. Fusier-Gir, the haberdasher of Cantenac. Mrs. Pauline Carton, the parish priest's maid. Do you want to advertise Milly Mathis, the owner of the cafe, with Henry Laverne and Paul Demange. One being her husband, and the other, her lover. Mr. Marcel Simon, the centenary of Cantenac. And here is Ramir. No, but listen... I beg your pardon. If you all talk at once, I won't be able to write anything down. - Here's how it starts. - A nice morning... No, it was one evening. No, no. It was a Thursday. It's probably for a movie. Ronnier will surely edit it. Mr. Baron de Cantenac, with his son-in-law and his wife. Ladies and gentlemen, the named villagers: Robert Seller, the carpenter; Luce Fabiole, the washer during the day; Numes Jr., the postman; Jacques Sablon, the roadmender. Are you aware of the miraculous event that happened in Cantenac? - I'm very interested, I admit it. - Let me tell you. - Go ahead. On September 2, at 8:20 a.m... Here is Sophie Mallet, the goose girl; Pierre Juvenet, the butcher; Marthe Sarbel, the baker; Yvonne Hebert, the ironer; Claire Brilletti, the nanny; Georges Spanelly, the architect. Take the trouble to go up. Here is Jacques de Feraudy, the blacksmith; Leon Walther, the butler; Solange Varennes, the shepherdess; Aziza Ali, the gypsy; Roger Poirier, the gardener; Germaine Duard, the servant. Would you mind going up to the waiting room? This is Bob Roucoules, the doctor; Paillette, the midwife; and Grethen, the carpenter. Come up, gentlemen. Varougeanne, the gypsy; and finally Bever, the gravedigger. That's how it ends. - And it couldn't have ended better. - We all think so. What are all these people? They're nice. They just told me about an extraordinary film subject. In this film, you will play the role of Mademoiselle, if miss wants it. Provided that you play the role of Baron de Cantenac. I can refuse nothing to the baron. He is a man, in fact, who never denies himself anything. Gentlemen, we're starting a new movie in a month. Francois Caron, would you like to be the production manager? Francois Gir, be my assistant. Renoux, do the decorations. Ramettre, be the operator. And please call up the recruits again. Mr. Louis, sound engineer. Miss Lefevre, be the script girl. Mr. Muller, be the stage manager. Oh, and here's Louiguy! Do you want to make music? Yes? So much the better. Three, four! Once upon a time there was a small village which sat modestly between Paimpol and Draguignan. It was a lovely little village. There are no ugly villages when viewed from a distance. Its name was Cantenac. It had been there for centuries and it had never been talked about before. Imagine what's coming to happen to it is a miraculous adventure. And it is precisely this adventure that I'm going to tell you about. But I have to start at the beginning, and I want to ask you the following question: do you know what a village is? Do you know how it starts? Well, it starts with a castle. It's hard to believe, but that's the way it is. A great lord decides one day to have himself built a magnificent castle. When you have such a castle built, we need many things. To build it, we need everything. And to live there, we need bread, milk, fruits, vegetables and flowers. Alas, we need meat. How not to hang the beauty of this rider and the nobility of the gesture of the worker. Maintaining the lord has no more harmony no grace than the gesture of a worker when he does his work with love. So close to the castle a village rises, which the day before was still only a hamlet, and which seems to come out of the ground at the call of the steeple. You have to have your reason for being on earth. This is why the castles of old knew how to make themselves useful by creating villages which sometimes became towns. Because give and take. When the village feeds the castle, the chateau supported him by providing him with work. And that's how in the 16th century, our little village was born, and such is the lord who brought him into the world. It's been around for almost 500 years. But it must be admitted that it has hardly existed for 150 years. It barely survives, poor thing. Because it no longer has a castle. It's finished. Since the Revolution, since 1793. But let's put an end to all that, because now the village rooster tell the rooster in the steeple that it's 5 o'clock. The bell tower repeats it and others will say it. Now the houses are slapped by the shutters. Then at the thresholds of the doors and in the frames of the windows appear, puffy and almost all sullen, 5, 10, 1 5, 20 faces of peasants. Let's get to know them. We are going to learn some great things. Because there are many extravagant things in this village. And speaking of extravagant things, here without further ado is the boozer of the place and the village idiot. This sweet drunkard is a subject of curiosity: we have never seen him drink and we always see him drunk. It's because he hides to drink. In my opinion, he should do the opposite. He should drink openly and hide when drunk. As for this little guy who sneaks around, who appears, who disappears, who likes to fade away, to prank everyone, he plays a fairly discreet role in the adventure, although it is essential. We will soon have the proof. Oh! It gets dark early this morning. Since she is coming to us, allow me to present her to you. Why does she walk like this? Why so many ways? Why is she wearing her hair this way? Because she had been to Paris one day. She deserved a lesson, and Prosper gave it to her. And this lesson did him great good. She knew love, and soon she became the village crane. That's what it's like to have been to Paris. But let's be serious. Here we have two men in evidence: the mayor and the priest. Both have their own strongholds, and it's not just the road that separates them. The mayor is disbelieving, profane, sectarian. He clings to his opinions as if someone wanted to take them from him, whereas no one in Cantenac shares them. It is the same with the priest, poor, dear and holy man. Nobody talks to him. He doesn't talk to anyone. Here is the reason. Between this mayor, who sits on the edge of the wells, as if to prevent the truth from coming out, and this priest whom everything divides: the character and the ideas, the mission of one, the function of the other, yes, between these two men, there is something. One thing that makes their hostility grow more serious every day and deeper still. These men are both brothers, and they are twins. The fight had been terrible between them not long ago, and it is claimed that one evening they had both come into conflict. The two men had fought bitterly over the villagers, who soon, not knowing which way to go, and desiring to lead a peaceful existence on earth without closing the sky irremediably, one day made the double determination not to set foot in church again, nor to meetings organized at the town hall for an obvious purpose. These people preferred to have no opinion of any kind, neither political nor religious, no, no, no! "May they both work it out and leave us alone." However, there are two concessions that everyone, Panurge's sheep if there ever was one, willingly made: every 4 years they voted for the mayor, and at the time of death, the night having come, they called the priest. And if they only vote at the last second, they only called the priest at the last minute, when all hope was lost, so as not to have trouble with the mayor in the event of recovery. Poor priest! What a bizarre existence he led! It was always in vain that he shook his bells. He no longer baptized, never confessed, never laughed at me. And as for his mass, he always said it in a low voice, his servant serving as an altar boy, since no child in the village did not agree to fulfill this pious duty. She did it against the consent of the priest and against the formal will of the bishop. This Eulalie, a cantankerous and devoted creature, moreover, acquitted herself of this duty in a rather unexpected way. She applied herself to sparing the goat and the cabbage. She served him his mass as she served him his lunch, so without manners and promptly. She considered that it was one more meal that her master took, and pretending to ignore the rites and customs, gave her a hand since she was his maid. She kept the genuflections for the house which would not have failed to be observed there. Then the mass being said, she passed in front of the mayor with her forehead held high, since she could claim that the pious duty she had performed was part of the housework she had to do. But if the influence of the priest was almost nil, it was not the same with that of his brother. This was exercised without control. He was jeopardizing the future of the village. It was his, the school, and he took advantage of it. R, o, b... That these names are forever engraved in the memory of men, what could be more natural? But do they have to be exclusively those? It is true to add that it was understood, but not listened. His young audience had concerns of a different order. Cantenac was spinning very bad cotton. To say that he lived on isn't even exact, he was rather dying out. By dint of living on themselves, to marry together and reproduce among themselves, the inhabitants of Cantenac have all become parents. Relatives more or less close. In such a small village, there cannot be distant relatives. Those who are not called Pidoux are called Lacassagne. It's one or the other. There are only two names left in the village. The other names have disappeared, as if absorbed by these two. But the Pidoux are very prolific. In about forty years, they will have absorbed the Lacassagnes. And already today, if someone dared to call: "Hey, Pidoux", we would see two-thirds of the village turn around. Did we see in Cantenac, coming from elsewhere, a living soul? In truth, never. Except for Dr. Laragounias, who came by every month, passed through the village, and never even set foot there, because he came by bicycle. - No need for my services? - Nope. Go your way, mister charlatan. And you, at least, try to go straight. - No need for my services? - No, doctor. Give him 40 francs to hear himself say: "Don't eat too much," no thanks. - You are too late. My husband died yesterday. Push my leg back and I'll give you my clientele. As for those, it is something else. And even the opposite. It is not without reason that he prudently deviates from it. Called by them last year, he had given this woman a massive dose of calomel who had, unwittingly, saved his life, which this man harbored a grudge against him forever. So, for one reason or another, Laragounias was unpopular in Cantenac. When he passed by the cemetery, the idiot never failed to shout at him... Hey, doctor, send us people! In truth, Cantenac is so badly placed and so devoid of interest that no one ever has the opportunity to come or go there. Now and then a stray car pretends to drive through the village, but as soon as it sees him, as if he were repulsive, she goes back in reverse and takes the straight path, a path that is not straight. I would be remiss if I did not mention an unexpected visit which made Cantenac so excited. This visit takes place a month or two before the considerable, unexpected, miraculous event, which was to completely transform Cantenac. This is the reason why I cannot dispense with telling you about it. A caravan of gypsies who came from who knows where, wandering and pitiful, stopped in the village square to the great astonishment of the inhabitants. From this trailer, we saw a creature descend, barefoot and tanned, oily hair, copper sequins and tambourine, who pretended to dance as if for herself alone, but all the same with an ulterior motive. - Instead of arguing... - Look what's happening to us. What she was hoping for finally happened, and when she saw that the majority of the village was there, she stopped dancing, and in a fluent gibberish, she informed that she was not only a dancer, but also read the lines of the hand. For the modest sum of 1 franc, she flattered herself that she could tell everyone their immediate future. Yes, but that, their future... They already had an idea of ​​it. And 1 franc is still 1 franc. And these women, they do not make fun of the world? Everyone was dying to consult her. One of them had to start. It was a woman. Another followed her. Then it was a man, then others. And all of them in the end passed away. Two hours later, they knew what to expect. Their future no longer held any secrets for them, and it was obvious. They were worried and tormented, more than usual. She had made the mistake of predicting their next happiness. Madness, let's see. Tell these people they were going to be happy, it was to tell them that they were unhappy. She realized it, alas too late. They had conceived for her a strong resentment: "She took our money, this moricaude!" Our Romanichelle hastened to leave the village. "She leaves!" "Trickster!," "thief," "garbage," "bastard!" Running after her, they threw stones at her. One of them broke her window pane and injured her. Oh, not a lot, but too many. They were proud of it that day. But they will regret it. Shall I tell you about coffee? Certainly. He plays a key role here. It is the meeting place for peasants, who are bored at home. At nightfall, they come there, and there they are grouped 4 by 4, around a shackle or a weasel. Looking at them closely, would you believe that these men are living happiest time of their day? They seem angry together. It is not so. These are not people who do not talk to each other. These are people who no longer speak to each other because they have told each other everything. For them to speak to each other, there must be a death. She is dead. - My poor Simon! It's horrible! - My poor friend! A death or a birth. "He's a little guy!" In truth, nothing else happens in Cantenac. But a birth does not have with them the success of a death. The first movement of joy passed, they listen with a distracted ear to the story of an event planned for months and which is of little interest to them. A death is something else. There is the unexpected in the agony, and sometimes, mystery. Some already they are distressing, but others bring to laugh, to laugh and to think. Especially since there are always a few questions of money involved. And finally, death hangs in the face of them all. To be born is done. Let these men to their thoughts, to their belotte. Turning to the patrons of the cafe, we observe a curious threesome. Here are the husband and the lover. And the woman, here she is. I will not have the impropriety to judge the physical attractions of this woman, for I would be remiss to grieve those men who regard her as beauty and grace personified. They speak of her as we spoke of Castiglione. Her eyes, her arms, her breasts, her hips and her smile, they are so charmed by it that everything is a pretext for them to sing his praises. It is precisely because they agree on this crucial point that these two men hate each other. They don't have the same political opinions, but basically they don't care. They are equally bad players, and their checkers games are sometimes stormy, but 5 minutes later, they both clink glasses. Nothing that separates them separates them. But because they agree on the beauty of this woman, here they are divided because of a hyphen. Besides, this fat man makes them tremble with fear. Because his jealousy is terrible and constant. He shouldn't see her doing any favors to that weakling. And it's been going on for 15 years. He watches them. And the other two don't trust it, believe me. When they want to kiss what precautions do they not take? The other is on the eye. He chases them into his room. And when he takes them together, there is no dead hand. It's a big kick in the ass put him back in his place. One would be entitled to ask this man so jealous the reason for which he supports this undesirable presence near the loved object. But that is a question that cannot be asked. Because this big authoritarian man is the lover. The weakling is the husband. As for the child of this woman, let him not kiss his father on the 1st, because his real father is him, the lover. The weakling knows it, the woman remembers it, and the child guesses it. - Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on! In this house there is a real phenomenon. So look, here is his old son, and that's the word, 87 years old, who plagues from morning to night. He is his youngest son. The two eldest died of rage. Not rage, rage. You will soon know why. This is his granddaughter, who is only 65, but who looks at least 83, undermined by her bad mood. His great-great-granddaughter, 22 years old. Here is his great-grandson coming out of the little place, and who now enters his 47th year grumbling. Finally he, the phenomenon, here he is. Born in 1821, he is now 128 years old. But it must be admitted that it appears to be barely 110. And there he is, smiling, making his great-great-great-grandson take his first steps, aged, if I may say so, 18 months. These 126 years which separate them also seem to bring them closer. Don't they have the same difficulty putting one foot in front of the other? The old man can still walk and the child can already walk. Which of the two is the other based on? Wouldn't the child be making the old man do his last steps? To the table! It's soup time. And here are 6 generations who immediately group together, the ancestor having for vis-a-vis the last offspring of his race. The same precautions are taken for the old man and the child, for the same small accidents are to be feared. One has no more teeth, and the other has none yet. Yes. But where does it come from that, with the exception of the centenary and the little child, the four middle generations have such sullen faces? And what do those wicked, cruel, ruthless, hateful looks mean, launched as if on the sly towards this mischievous old man who realizes it? Why do the four of them seem impatient? Why such great concern? What are they waiting for? They are waiting for the old man to die. They are worried because they do not see it coming. We've been waiting for his death for 60 years, and he knows it, and it amuses him. Not only does he not die, but he looks younger, the bugger. Last year he wasn't doing so well. But see it, look at it! You would swear his son is older than him. It's odious, really. It's immoral too. One has no right to make one's inheritance wait like this. It shouldn't be allowed. It should be agreed that past the hundred, we share our property. Is this old man so rich that they are waiting for his death like this? Oh, it's much more complicated than that. He's not just rich, he may be very rich. What he has is a treasure. This treasure, he hid it. And no one has ever been able to find out. The house, they have visited it 100 times from top to bottom. They turned the garden soil 10 times, in vain. Is it upstairs? Is it on the left? Am I there right? If they knew where the treasure is hidden, the old man would have died accidentally a long time ago. From time to time, like that, he calls them to him and said to them: "My treasure, "You will not know where he is until the moment of my death. "But until then..." And that's the moment they're waiting for, watching for. Oh that, but... Thus, to amuse himself, the old man gives them false joys. False joys that deal them a mortal blow. So much so that he saw die of exasperation his wife, then his brother, his two sisters, his brother's three children and his two eldest sons. But tell me, now his youngest son seems to spin a very bad cotton. Such a bad cotton that positively here it goes. Squeak! An embolism. We were waiting for the death of the father, and it is the son who is leaving. It's so funny. And our cent en aire can't help but think as soon as he'll bury them all. And here is another one to whom his treasure will have passed under his nose. His joy is shared by his great-great-great-grandson, whose new death increases his rights to the inheritance by one degree. Here is the small store where they sell everything, socks, nails, sardines... Let's stop for a moment: it's worth it. The haberdasher leaves. She goes for an errand, and claims she'll be back in 10 minutes. His daughter is there, and she is the curiosity. She is the only pretty girl in the village, but the village does not know that she is a pretty girl. These people only see one thing: she is not like the others. They know what it's like to have a beautiful, fat, plump girl, a girl with cheeks like apples, whose buttocks we slap to tell him that we find it to his liking and that we are a gallant man. A, of course, they know it, but they don't know it's nice not to be vulgar, to have a nose like that and hold your head up high. They don't go so far as to say it's a monster, but most think so, because it seems monstrous to them to have such a high forehead, such white skin, such fine features, a neck so thin and so flexible, and delicate hands, so long, so slender. -A tie, something that matches my complexion. She doesn't seem normal to them. They say she has monkey hands, they think she's too skinny, and believe she has tuberculosis. The centenarian remembers that his great-great-grandmother had that same little head no bigger than a fist at the top of a very long neck. Eulalie, who had known her grandmother, claims that she already looked like her when she was still little. The physical singularities of this girl, to believe them, had to skip a generation, as well as eczema, arteriosclerosis and constipation. -Do you have oilcloth notebooks? Because they tell him you. She is the only one in Cantenac that no one knows. They conclude that it is a minnow who thinks he's come out of Jupiter's thigh. Can we have a coil like this? Can we have a reel like this? Yes. And you? - Give me a glass of mirabelle plum. How do you say? A glass of... Oh sorry. In place of mira belle, would you by any chance have shoelaces? - I have one pair left. - Oh, that's too much for half. I only want one. It's for the one-legged. It is his birthday. I'm saving you the other for his party. - How much? - 5 francs. Keep it all. Have you seen these colors? Say, I'm talking to you. Provided she gave me the lace of the left foot. Whether or not they consider her a monster, one fact is that she is already 24 and no guy has asked her to marry him. It worries youth, without awakening any other feeling, at least it seems to him. There are only certain more very young married men who recognize something in him. They don't know what but it makes them blush, especially when their wife is next to her, and they can make comparisons that their half, much wiser, usually repeals. So, are you frozen in front of her? That day, Blanche went too far. She leaned over the flat window of the counter as if to say to him: "Take care of yourself, if you are ill with the bronchial tubes." the other suddenly opened the window, as if to say to him: "So go fix your face yourself." - Why did you fight? - For nothing. - Then tell me for whom? - But for no one. Can you swear to me it's not for Paul? He even refused my hand. Look at them both leaving together. If you hurt her, you'll have to deal with me. I hope you understood me. - What's wrong with me, mom? - I don't know. -She didn't really know. She wondered if it wouldn't become a habit in the country not to ask for her daughter's hand. No one asked her, but as the years passed, she imagines that she is asked less and less of her. What happened to you also happened to your grandmother. And who you look like exactly. So she ended up marrying just anybody. I want to marry anyone, mom. I went out for that. I chose you... - Anyone. He's still a man. Who is it, mom? He is old? Nope. He is very young. You want to see it? I let him in there. - Won't you tell me who it is? - Nope. I want you to be surprised. Would you like to marry her? -Oh no! I'm stupid, but I'm not stupid. Why do not you want? Because she is too beautiful. The idiot alone guessed that she was ravishing. By the way, why does everyone think he's an idiot? Because he has baroque ideas and whims, as those who are out of the ordinary often have. They call him stupid because he has an ugly little dog on a leash. And that he tells her stories, which is not a sign of foolishness. They say he's stupid because he sometimes laughs for no reason, when he deserves it all the more. They say he's stupid because every evening at dusk, he goes alone to the cemetery and leaves a daisy, a poppy, sometimes even an ear of wheat, on the grave which is in the center of the enclosure. But since the 16th century, this is where the lords of this village rest. Because if since 1793, they no longer have a castle, at least they kept the habit of being buried there, among these beloved countries. - "Alain Pidoux, master glassmaker. "The Sire de Cantenac, poet and captain. "Jean-Francois, squire to King Henry IV." And we have, in short, an aspect of the village as it once was. There, the castle remains, surrounded by thatched cottages. "Philippe de Cantenac, Bishop of Perpignan. "Amedee de Cantenac, Marshal of France. "Vivien de Cantenac, member of the Institute." Because if we destroyed the cradle of this noble family, we neglected to ransack its tomb. "Pierre de Cantenac, "Ambassador of France." So much so that not being able to be born here, Jean de Cantenac dead on the scaffold, Antoine de Cantenac died in exile, all the barons of Cantenac were brought there when they died. The latest, Arthur de Cantenac, was deposited there on April 12, 1922. He had committed suicide. But are there still any Cantenacs left? There is one more, no more, and here it is. Here is the last Baron de Cantenac. He is a 70-year-old man who is as poor on his own as all the cottages in his village put together. If I compare them, it's because he looks like Cantenac. Wrapped in his greenish cape, he looks like he is covered in ivy, and under his big exorbitant straw hat, one would think he was wearing stubble. What he loses in happiness and youth, he regains in picturesqueness. He lives in a pavilion in the heart of an old farm, itself located 10 leagues from Paris. How does he live? In slow motion. And like his village, he is slowly dying. Nothing prevents him from giving life a tip of the hat, which his village cannot do. He is perfectly free to hasten this end which sometimes seems to him a little slow in coming. Because is it living to vegetate like this in this shack and under conditions which, though exceptional, are no less heartbreaking? And to have so many chickens, to have a gardener, a flock of geese, one must have some fortune, it will be said. Well, no. Monsieur le Baron has returned. - You think? So let's hurry. And here they are hurrying. And to have this perfectly stylish old butler, and this pleasant and considerate cook, you have to have pensions. No, again. Because these people whom he kept for 30 years in his service have now become his guests. After making a fortune with the baron, they bought this farm and took him in there. They are not content to be unpaid by him, they lodge him free of charge in their homes, feed him and serve him. With as much love as respect. They wouldn't accept it otherwise. They became peasants for their pleasure, but at mealtimes, duty above all else, they resume service with their old master. Thank you. Thank you. He lives in this way, in furniture that he intends to leave them, surrounded by tables which constitute his only possession. Because the fortune of the baron currently amounts to 12,500 francs. Not a penny less, not a penny more. And all in all, very quickly, wouldn't it be better to end it? What could he expect from life? Nothing. Fate? A miracle. He no longer hoped for it. Dramatic situation which was to leave him cold. He had sworn to cut short his life abruptly at a time when existence would no longer seem livable to him. That is why the event must have left him doubly cold. But the fatal hour had come that morning. His will was soon made. The little that remained of its past splendour, furniture, objects and paintings, he offered it to his servants. M. de Cantenac realized something he had never thought of before: he had been an absolutely useless man all his life. He had never done anything with his ten fingers. By not having played any specific role on earth, he would have had bad grace to attach importance to its abolition. And if he slowly hid his will, it was not in the hope that someone would come to prevent him from killing himself, no, no, but he didn't mind being the impassive spectator. He would have been sorry for lacking in self-control at such a moment. He reviewed his life, regretted never having been to Florence, for not having lived in the eighteenth century and for never having seen Sarah Bernhardt in Phedre. He had adored women, but indiscriminately. He congratulated himself that he had never had any illusions nor about the feelings they showed him, nor on those he felt for them. Familiar now with the idea of ​​disappearing, he felt a kind of bitter pleasure, and as long as he closed his eyes, he saw very well that he was no longer there. He liked to imagine this now respected chair, therefore vacant. His objects, his pipe, his razor, his comb, his shaving brush, have become relics. He grouped them in thought among the works of art. Only the fate of his glasses tormented him a little. Not being able to see anything without them, what would they see without him? But everything else, he was mourning. His decision having been made and the hour of his departure fixed, what was this engraving which held his attention? And who also held his hand? It was a beautiful drawing from the eighteenth century, one of Hubert Robert's finest. It was the Chateau de Cantenac, with its little village. An idea suddenly occurred to him: to know Cantenac. This old tree had some impatience in its roots. To have seen his village, rush there head first before going there soon feet first. 24 hours later, the Baron de Cantenac entered Cantenac in a surprising crew. This bulky old gentleman dragged by such a small horse, there was indeed enough to surprise our villagers. But their surprise was matched only by his. For if these did not come back, this one, for his part, could not believe his eyes. If they found it all funny, he found them very sad. And if he made some of them giggle, he perceived things that upset him. And met looks that would have made her cry, if he hadn't turned his head away. He had a completely different idea of ​​his village. And he was extremely affected by it. So much so that, moreover, he shortened the visit. He wanted to go where his fathers' castle once stood, but not having a taste for ugly things and little fond of sinister impressions, he turned back. Why walk among old stones? Why run after the witnesses of a bygone past? Since this castle is no more, isn't it better to imagine it, resplendent, haughty? His thoughts led him to the cemetery, where miraculously spared, this final abode was intact. The peasants had followed him. He didn't care. With peace of mind, listing all his ancestors, he became more familiar with the idea of ​​joining them soon. While at Cantenac he was putting his ideas in order, his servants were cleaning Fontenay from top to bottom. Having collected himself for a few minutes, he retraced his steps and went to the church. -Oh my God! Baron de Cantenac had entered the holy place to ask the parish priest to record certain declarations what he had to do with her. Which were certainly of the keenest interest, but which he had to keep secret. He didn't speak to anyone else, then got back into his cart. He walked away, his heart sorry to have come. His little town... He had said hello to her, he was saying goodbye to her. - Have you seen this old gentleman? - I saw him. So what? If he'd told no one who he was, everyone had an inkling of it. Apart from the hundred in air, who had not seen him, everyone was convinced that the baron had paid them a visit. Some agreed that they would not be surprised, others that it would not surprise them, and in vain the mayor defended himself against it, he defended himself badly. And if it was the Baron de Cantenac? The centenary, obstinate, pretended there was no more Cantenac. - What do you know about that? - What do you mean? If there was still one left, he would know. What makes you say that? The look he has. Yes perfectly. I think he looks very great. I agree with you. Give me your hand. - Why did you refuse? - I didn't dare take it. Why do you dare today? Because I have a feeling you won't pull it off. Mom, it's a Cantenac. Now I'm sure. Word of it was spreading, and now it was a certainty. The centenary himself was shaken. Some claimed they would get their hands on it. But how had they guessed it? I don't know, but when an adventure is miraculous, it is from beginning to end. One of them had to know more, and it was the priest. The old gentleman and he had had a talk. Prosper was sure of it. Therese, Onesime, Isidore and himself had seen them, with their eyes seen, talking together. And it wasn't the priest who was talking. Well then, let's get it over with. Blandina! What had he said to her that was so extraordinary for the priest to sign himself. The priest stammered but didn't want to say anything. What did Blandine want from him, who was coming like this? The centenary wanted to see him immediately. He was going to die? Not at all. What he was waiting for was more urgent than extreme unction. They kept telling him that this visitor was the Baron de Cantenac, and that the priest knew it. He wanted to know the end of it. We were going to see how he managed to confess a priest. Did that old gentleman tell you his name was Cantenac? No. He didn't say it, but I have every reason to believe him. And for what reason? He told me to say mass for the dead for M. de Cantenac. And how can he know that in advance? I wonder that too. It made me prick up my ears. If he knows in advance that he is going to die, he is going to commit suicide. He didn't tell you anything else? He told me he would arrive here on Thursday to be buried. This must be prevented at all costs. Did he give you his address? - Yes. - Well, go ahead. Ah... that's all. Good. And he orders Claire to lend him his bicycle. - Mine? - Of course, his. They have skirts, these people. And let the priest bring the baron back to him. Because he has capital revelations to make to him. Only, attention: motus to everyone. And the priest swears it. At least, he promises. And off he went. And all of them asked, "Where is he going?" Where he's going? To hell. Back home, finally, I understand myself, Mr. de Cantenac didn't waste a second. His decision to end his life was strengthened by the visit he had just made to his village. In 5 minutes, I'm yours. Our holy man is hurrying. He meets a gentleman who read it. He is so unaccustomed to it that he wonders if he knows it. The priest of Cantenac. Let him come in. The priest transmitted the centenarian's request to him, and 10 minutes later they were on the road. Hey, I had done well to remove the bullets. Here he is! - Sit down. - Sit down. Thank you. Sit down. And now, let's not waste a minute. I recognized you right away. You have strong blood, you people, the Cantenacs. No need to ask you for your papers, you are family. You are of two species. You are tall and strong, with a nose... a nose like you have, or else you are blessed with a very small head mounted on a stork's neck, as we have a curious one... - Specimen? - Yes. As we have a specimen with the yarn of the haberdasher. But finally, this... I recognized you right away, thanks to the portrait my father had made of your great-grandfather. Did your father know my great-grandfather? -Yes. We are a hundred in aires in the family from father to son since Bouvines. My grandfather was born in 1698. And he died at 103. And he had my father at 70 years old. We're not only centenarians, in the family. We also make love, and without difficulty, even when one is dilapidated. Back to what interests us. My father was born in 1768. So he was 25 years old when the Revolution broke out. You know what happened. People... Quite well-meaning, no doubt. They came here, they burned the castle, seized the Baron de Cantenac, who, sensing misfortune, and he was right, since misfortune has happened: he ascended the scaffold three days later. So, the night before, he sent for my father, who was his servant, and entrusted him with a treasure. - "A treasure?" - Saying these words: "When the time is right, you will give it to my son Antonin." What did my father do? - I don't know. He buried the treasure. Hey, is that... You had to be careful. A few years later, calm having returned, he sought out Antonin. Oh, sorry, sorry! Baron Antoninus. Excuse me. He looked for Baron Antonin but he did not find him. He was exiled. The fool. Oh sorry! I agree with you. And he died in America. - You should never go into exile. - Never. But that one was your great-grandfather. Who was your grandfather? - Henri de Cantenac. Died in war. - And your father? Arthur de Cantenac. He killed himself in Monaco. Ruined at the game. - Ouch, ouch, ouch! But then tell me you don't have to rolling in money. - Nope. - You're not poor after all? -Yes. So I arrive on time with your treasure. - You can tell. How funny that you are so poor being so rich. Well, being so rich, maybe. For the treasure is there money, is it precious stones, are these family heirlooms? - Don't you know? - I don't know at all. I never wanted to know. My father never knew either. All I know is it's bulky, it's heavy, in a sort of trunk that big. Are there pistols, are there knives, is it old scrap metal? We will find out tonight. Or rather tonight. There is an old abandoned house in the village that for 50 years I have been passing for a haunted house so that no one comes near it. That's where I hid it. So we'll both go tonight at midnight. I go there every 10 years. I look, I feel, and then I leave. I always have the key on me, hanging around my neck. I even pass it on my back when my nose bleeds. That night, when everyone was in bed, when the last candle was finally blown out, and while midnight struck from all the steeples of France, the Baron de Cantenac and our centenary went to this haunted house which jealously concealed the treasure of the barons of Cantenac. The door was not closed. She never was. The old man knew that thieves, prying and ghosts themselves never enter houses whose doors are open, because thieves, prying eyes and ghosts are necessarily fearful people, who when they don't have to force locks, are afraid of encountering other thieves, indiscreet people and even ghosts in houses that do not close properly. It - the treasure - is in the attic. It is hidden under old bags. Here are the bags. Let's lift them. Oh, curses! The treasure is no longer there. Its trace is there, on the floor. Let's follow its trail. They hear a snoring that panics them and reassures them. Do ghosts snore? Monsieur le Baron, framed like this, you look like one of your ancestors. Hush, let's move on. Let's go slowly. That's where we snore. The idiot! The idiot sleeps soundly over the treasure he guards. I changed it. Where he was, there were too many rats. I don't like rats. - What are you doing here? - We make the ghost, Both. Why are you ghosting? - To keep your treasure, of course! - How do you know what is a treasure? - It can be guessed, these things. In such a box, double-locked, it would be unthinkable to keep cow dung. - How do you know what is mine? - Because you have, grandfather, the small, laughing and always sideways eye of the man who possesses a treasure. And also because only you dared to talk about the haunted house. And finally, because I saw you enter it one night, like a thief, and come out empty-handed. Since then I've been watching over him by sleeping on it, wrapped in an old bed sheet, ready to play the ghost if anyone came. - You are a brave little man. Because I'm stupid. You may be telling the truth but you already know too much not to know more. - Do we open it in front of him? - "We open it in front of him." Besides, it's not bad that we have a witness. - The treasure is yours. You have all the rights. But there are only costumes. Yes. Who constitute in the order a real treasure embroidered with honor. - How heavy is that one! - Honors are heavy. And this one, and that one... -Oh, for example! What is that? It's the leather apron of a master glassmaker. - That of Alain Pidoux. - Perfectly. And that's all. - But yet it was so heavy. - There must be a false bottom. Yes, maybe. No, I do not see. I've found it! Take your hands off, you'll see. GOLD COINS! And how much! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15... Now, this treasure having been realised, the baron noticed that he inherited an unexpected fortune, considerable certainly, but all the same calculable. That's millions, many millions, but not billions. So there was no splurging. What was he going to do? His decision was soon made: Cantenac. This fortune came to him from Cantenac, and it belonged to him by right. Cantenac. He had no other idea. Make it happy, yes, but make it your own way. Distribute the gold to these unfortunates: the idea had occurred to him, but he had quickly dismissed it. It would have been to make misers of them, and that's not how you make people happy. It was then that he conceived the phenomenal project of bringing life back to his little village, to start from scratch, to start all over again. 48 hours later, he received a notorious architect whom he had brought from Paris. He explained to him what he expected of him. From the following Thursday, he was no longer the same. His little Horse was raised to his 20th power, and to realize his extravagant dream, he went back to his little village. But, passing through Thibervalle... He stopped at a notary's. Master Jadoux, notary? Do you have land for sale around Cantenac? Are you chasing me? Are you deaf? Mute? I'm a buyer. Yes, yes, yes. Immediately. Thank you. Tell me, my dear master, the formalities will be settled later. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Having acquired a hundred hectares, he went there immediately. He was welcomed there by the parish priest, who asked him to consider himself at home in the presbytery. Mr. de Cantenac immediately accepted the priest's proposal. The same day, after dinner, from these plots of land he had just acquired, he made a fair division among the villagers, who couldn't believe their ears or their eyes. Eulalie, who assisted him kindly, gave him valuable information about his fellow citizens. Pointing out to him which were the poorest or the most meritorious. "4 children," she said. Or: "weak bronchi." the indication she provides him on Fortune encouraged the baron to offer him a plan of a vineyard. Fortune told himself that he was not the only one to like wine. Here! The baron found that Paul Pidoux did not lack distinction. But his astonishment was even greater when he saw Virginie Lacassagne. Who is this person? She's the haberdasher's daughter. Ah, it's the haberdasher's daughter. The baron remembered that the centenarian had spoken to him about it. He had given her a faithful, significant description and moreover tendentious. Definitely, the proverb speaks true: birds of a feather flock together. She was beautiful, she was young. He was young, he was handsome. And jealous too. Baron de Cantenac did not expect so much. Would things go wrong? No. Because over this treasure the idiot watched too. You wouldn't have a field of daisies by any chance? And the distribution continued, their faces lighting up with a childish smile which charmed the baron. But that was still nothing. The men no longer wandered idle through the streets of the village. Their tools, scythes, rakes, shovels, pickaxes, spades, they carried with pride on their shoulders. From dawn, they worked in the fields, and in the evening, they had what gives a job done: clear conscience. Sidonie herself had pretended to make herself useful. She was dragging this cow she was talking to like a big dog. "Do you want to come here right away? Come on!" Fortune, the inveterate alcoholic, claimed that in future he would only drink milk. The intention was not bad, and it should be encouraged, but having lost the habit of walking straight, he had a tendency to bump into things everywhere. Lady, you don't improve overnight, everything has to be measured. The mayor had understood this well. He was beginning to water down his red wine. N, A, P... These great men already, he added them to the others. WE... Then, resolutely, he gave them all a hug. The children couldn't believe it. They would see many more. The lord of the village was preparing a huge surprise for them all. On the spot where the castle of his fathers once stood, he built an unexpected residence, on which he based the greatest hopes. Conforming to the beautiful drawing of Hubert Robert and according to the baron's instructions, the architect had executed the model. "That pleases you?" "Yes, I like it very much. "I didn't want it to be old or modern. "It doesn't have to be new or old. “I want it to be very simple and very beautiful. "That is to say, it has to be very French. "I wish a mansion would be built "like a phrase from Voltaire or Anatole France." But of that he must not breathe a word to anyone. "Hey, over there! I see you three!" No one was allowed to scale these walls. The villagers became familiar with the joy of living. These were reconciled. This one proposed to marry Eulalie, if she promised never to run it. When evening came, they sang. -If I had to list all the kisses she gave I could well count 100,000. And more And more And that's precisely why I love it -LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA... Others were dancing. What are you doing all alone? I don't have a dancer. -Oh good! I go down. They were both burning to dance. Both means together. But it was up to the one who wouldn't invite the other. Marivaux, Marivaux, here are a lot of your tricks. He thought her skirt was lovely, but he remembered that of this Romanichelle. He wished it had been a little longer. She, she wished him a less dirty suit. Miracle of love, her skirt was getting longer. Miracle of love, his suit was clean. Miracle of love, her skirt went to the floor. Let's embrace The rumba that begins Indicate to lovers Its rhythm and cadence Let's embrace Let's be at his mercy Let's respect its pace and commit like this A foolish recklessness Dance, dance, dance with me Without knowing if my heart is faithful or mocking disloyal or sincere Hold, hold, hold me tight And you'll know tomorrow if you're just a canary And if I'm mean Sing, sing, sing with me And if you betray me I don't care today Tomorrow I leave you Don't, don't, don't give your heart The rumba that ends Indicates to lovers That's the end of the dream Let's open our eyes wide and say thank you To have us like this Makes commit in cadence A foolish recklessness Dance, dance, dance, dance Dance, dance... Two hours later, tired of dancing, they were drinking near the pond, which was not a good idea. Unless you like mosquitoes, you have to stay away from ponds. Oh, the camels! And Fortune, whose return to drinking was celebrated, claimed that, against mosquitoes, there was no other system than his. To get rid of a mosquito, you must not waste a moment, not make a gesture, not say a word. So, hold on, Prosper... -Hurry up! He will never have it, his mosquito. While his... Offering him his arm and looking like nothing... it waits for it to arise. One, two... He got it. But now the haberdasher sees one on her cheek. Perfect. Oh no, thank you. Isidore prefers his mosquito. As for Gustave, see, he is already stung. - No, not like this. - He caresses me. Leave us. Very well. - There! Perfect! - Nope! We argue. Well, excuse me. Oh, here's a beautiful one! Oh, and then this one. Because, under the pretext of mosquitoes, they took the opportunity to settle old quarrels. All quarrel being settled, good humor reigned henceforth in the village. They were only thinking of having fun. They thought only of working. Anxious to embellish herself, this one was beginning to eat up her fund. And most had bought bicycles. What are you doing with these flowers? We just found out that this gypsy, the one who predicted we were going to be happy... She stands on the road to Thibervalle. We bring them to him as a token of gratitude. We will share them there. She'd like that better than stones. Well, did it make him happy? No more than that? She told us that it was not worth thanking her. Yet she predicted happiness for us. But she admitted to us that for 10 years, she had been predicting the same thing in all the villages. She'd made fun of us. Want to see something extraordinary? Look. To the great astonishment of all, the mayor was seen who, having walked for a long time in front of the church, finally get in there. For some, this behavior seemed abnormal. Wasn't he going to attack his unfortunate brother? Didn't he have to tell the baron about it? The mayor looked in vain for his brother in the deserted church. Where was he hiding? He wasn't hiding, he was in the confessional. Someone was going to confession, whose feet the mayor saw. So he waited. If asked what, he would have said, "My turn." Does it seem disturbing to you that the mayor entered the church? So go see what's going on, and if necessary, I'll intervene. The person who was confessing left the confessional. It was Eulalia. She went to confession every morning at the priest's request, because he had lost the habit. She accused herself of 5 or 6 imaginary sins, and the holy man could get his hands dirty. I am listening to you, my child. I am not your child, I am your brother. - It's you? - You can see it. - No, I don't. But I hear it's you. Has anyone seen you? - Me, I'm not ashamed. Would you come to confession? - Not exactly. I would like you to forgive me and we kissed. - forgive you, I can do it like we're here, but we're kissing, it's not so easy. Let's go out together. THEY KISS, MR. BARON! THEY'RE KISSING! So life is beautiful. And what for a long time the baron wanted to do, he did that day. He had seen Virginie many times but had never spoken to her. Miss, I read it to you. I bow to you. Would you please welcome me a moment? - Sure. Mademoiselle, I wanted to see you, and see you up close. - "Up close?" - Yes. To better realize... My God! Absolutely striking resemblance between my grandmother's mother and you, miss. My ancestors loved their villagers very much. And please don't be surprised or upset by a resemblance that calls into question Madame your great-great-grandmother. I am all the less upset than our villagers of old loved their lords very much, and especially their lords. Don't listen. He's charming. - He's not a liar. - Why? You're charming. A year later, the architect came to the presbytery. Monsieur le Baron, it's all over. I kept my word. I haven't been there yet, I kept my word. And they both went there, model in hand. "I look at her well, I am impressed by her, "and I will be his pity if your model lied." But the model was sincere, and the miracle exceeded his hopes. Admirable. Moving. Wonderful. I made you both ask, not so that you would have the first of the surprise for my village, but to ask you to please help me to put some order in these windows. Would you like? These are the costumes, the uniforms of those who were my ancestors. Here's the habit of Pierre de Cantenac, Ambassador of France. Here's the cassock of Monseigneur de Cantenac. And that? This is the leather apron of a master glassmaker who lived in the 16th century, Alain Pidoux. - Wasn't he a nobleman? - He became one later. Do you know what a true noble is? A man who ends up bearing the name of his village, so much he has value, courage or pride. Now this master glassmaker was from Cantenac. One day there he became "de Cantenac." There is no greater honor than to bear the name of one's village. He was the founder of our dynasty, and soon, very soon, we will have the opportunity to honor his memory. Can I afford to entrust them to you? Miss? Sir? Nothing. Young man? - Sir? Nothing. And now let's sit down. Miss, the day you appeared to me, my first thought was to recognize you, since in truth I recognized you. But on reflection, I prefer to adopt him. I don't care if you're a Lacassagne. If I make him Baron de Cantenac, you become a baroness by marrying my son. Needless to say, this is the happiest day of my life. The village of Monsieur le Baron has arrived. Let him enter. My dear fellow citizens, I have two words to say to you. Having received this unexpected treasure from the hands of our centenary, I made the best use of it by building this house. But today, I am broke. Yes, ruined. But... But it might well be let us get rich. There is only one way to get rich with dignity: work. The founder of my family was a master glassmaker. Here is his leather apron. This apron, I take it back. Yes. I'm taking this apron back. Because to be sumptuous, the place where we are is no less a workshop. Starting from scratch, master glassmaker, I become again. The 32 glasses that are on this table were made that very night. But we are 33 drinkers. The missing glass is mine. I don't want anyone other than me to do it. And I want to hope that in 80 years, to those who will visit this village, you will say - I am speaking to young children - that it is a craftsman who, to everyone's happiness, solved the problem. You say in...? 80 years old! "80 years old?" You heard it. If in 80 years, people will have to be told that it was a craftsman who, to our luck, solved the problem, don't worry. I'll tell them myself. THE END
