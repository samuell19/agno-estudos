I'm closing. - I have no other choice. - Hey soldier. Stop talking. - Forget-me-not. It's me, Zina. - Get undressed. - What are you, Brusnichkin, in general? - Oh, okay, let's go. I think that the exercises were successful. Me for a minute. Brusnichkin. “That’s right, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel. - The punishment was well-deserved. Although the highest commander's aerobatics consists in accomplish the combat mission and save people. - So why am I sitting in the guardhouse, comrade lieutenant colonel? - How for what? I chtoli took vodka without money. -I don't see the logic. I made the only right decision. -At ease. Not everything works out logically, sergeant. Sometimes it is necessary to act according to the highest meaning. And in terms of meaning, you are a good man, Brusnichkin, according to the reviews. Born sapper. They say people like you one in a thousand. So the proposal is we send you to the school of ensigns. -I have another plans. I want to go to aviation. - Don't rush, sergeant. You need an army. And the army needs people like you. Think. And submit a report. - How much are the flowers? - You're a ruble fifty. - Give me five. - I don't even know where she might be. You better go home.

And you take it, Love. Show him the apartment, the books. You take it. - Yes. - Yes, it's not all of them. This is a friend of his parents. And his parents two-room apartments, however, are also very good, with a loggia. And the owners of this apartment are away. So they asked them to live, look after things, feed the dogs. - How is the apartment, nothing? - Good books, good apartment. -Interesting. I thought you would say: "It can be better." - Maybe it happens, but I have not seen the best. -And I like you. Please come to the table. - Well, for the return to normal. - You Sen, still don't drink? - I still don't drink. Are you still up in the clouds? - Yes, I am. - To be honest, I thought that Mariska made up this story about the tenacious tin soldier, who was in love with her and dreamed of flying to the stars. It turns out you exist. - As you can see. - Do you drink water? You know, among my acquaintances there is no one who would like to become an astronaut, except for my nephews. They are in my kindergarten Rocket go. - It's their stupidity. No, why? By childish thoughtlessness. In general, some of our conversations are not pleasant. What you should probably dot the i. No, of course I could apologize to you, but for what? It's not my fault that this happened. Here. In general, it is likely that Mariska and I will get married. What will happen next - will be seen. I don't understand what you mean by that? -I want to say that for two years I was far from here, could not influence events. Now the situation has changed. -Maybe you didn’t understand yourself, the thing is, that I love Marina. - I love her too. Goodbye. I will come next Sunday. - For what? - To see you. -No need. I beg you, don't. -Goodbye. -So let's decide. At the moment I don't have a driver. Married. Instead of taking your wife moved to his wife in the village. Chauffeur me and in the spring you will switch to a tractor. - Thank you. - Wait, don't rush. How are our military forces? What state are they in now? - Good, thanks. - Boiler pleasure, how about a feeder? - They feed well. - How about discipline? - And the discipline is good. - Oh, you, Brusnichkin. You are not a spiritual person. Tell me something about the service. Were there many funny stories in the service? Here I had a foreman by the name of Kopeyka. Everyone in the army had foremen, Ivan Petrovich. Who can I get car keys from? - I have. - Goodbye. -Yes Yes Yes Yes. Please. Senya? I forbade you to come. Nobody can stop me from coming. Is it just the traffic police? And then, if the motorcycle is out of order. - Come on. Do you want tea? - Want. - What tea? What tea? Now the huntsman will come to me. He can see you here. - He'll have to meet with me for a while. - What time? - Until you get married for him or for me. - Good good. I will get married. Just leave now. -Hello. Damn it, I completely forgot. You promised to visit on Sundays. -Are you ready? Got movie tickets. Only two. Nothing, don't despair. Let's go in three, buy from hand. Rivalry is so rivalry. Let it be open honest. We will now go everywhere in threes. -Let's go to. Come on, we're already late. Happily. - If he comes again, I'll prick his ears. - Can not you see, what is humiliating you? - I see. He does not take me seriously and is deeply mistaken. He will soon be convinced of this. - It seems to me that you, Senechka, are in the sixth grade. Set a goal and now You prove to everyone that you can achieve anything with perseverance. With perseverance and perseverance, anything can be achieved. - Yes, she loves Igor. I know that. I failed all exams and tests. She now does not care about anything, except for Igor. Afraid. I'm afraid she'll be kicked out. - She loved me too. "Wait, maybe there's more... - It's pointless to wait. You know I... I'm used to acting. -Guys, but this one from the black Volga, I think hello. Look, now he reads and runs again. They speak English from the tape recorder. The tape recorder speaks Japanese. -Japanese. Do you have any music? -Please. What are you drawing for? -For future graphics. Where is the road at what safe speed, in what areas it can be passed. - What for? -For comfort. You know what roads we have. And you, for example, say: "You need to get to such and such an hour there." I look, I choose the best option. Nonsense, this is Senya. Nobody needs it. You have to be on time - leave early. -What are you buzzing about? Come out and help. - So. Sat down? Do you have a shovel? - Let's eat now. -So. Let's all get together. Go ahead. Come on, come on, get on the gas. - What, help? - Order. -Thank you. - In the new complex we will have all such cows. -Not bad, not bad. Swipe. - But there are not enough building materials. - Honey, you're not alone. - Understand, for the feed shop. Slate, cement. I have everything else. Here we have laid the feed shop and we are standing. - Well, let's help. Let's help. - Oh, you know. - Sit down, sit down. - Can the driver invite to eat something, huh? And then after all somehow it is not convenient. - Do I really look like a person who leaves hungry for your chauffeur? No, it doesn't. Yes, he won't go. He has a routine. Lunches tight, yogurt for dinner. Prepare to be astronauts. - What kind of astronauts? Why is he suddenly? Maybe he just, thank you, it's time to get married? Strange, very strange. My Baikal is already drunk. - It's a shame. He has a smart head, repairs color TVs. Not to mention other household appliances. He would have collected for a car in a year. On TV, no one understands. Twisted the nut and appointed ... - Don't listen to him, Illarion Stepanovich. Have a snack. -Thank you. And why is he went to the driver, huh? - Time factor. Bring, sit and wait. Sometimes three hours four have to wait. Reading books at this time and preparing for the institute. Oh, now it will run. An hour of study, then a run, then again classes. - So maybe you have one? - No, I'm watching. Of course with a shift, but the shift is harmless. He is a born driver, a virtuoso. That's why I keep it. Now everyone is talking about the village, everyone is baking about it. - Treat. - Everyone teaches her, but you give ourselves to figure it out. Don't rush us and we'll figure it out. -Now is the time, we must hurry. A little behind. - Yes of course. - Oh, right, Illarion Stepanovich. So I missed the train. It's my grandson's birthday tomorrow twins for five years. If I had remembered earlier I would have been able to. - You can do it today. I'll call Brusnichkin now, he has charts, calculations. He will definitely tell you everything. He doesn't make mistakes with me. Plus, minus one minute. Checked. - That's not convenient somehow. We won't talk about grandchildren. Tomorrow is a responsible meeting in the region. And for him the main thing is that the goal was set. If there is a goal, he achieves it. - Let's risk it. - In principle, it is possible. If we leave no later than than two minutes later. - I'm ready. - Illarion Stepanovich, so plainly they didn't talk about the case. Come again. You can organize such a fishing trip. - Let's call, call. Hello. -And they say you want to become an astronaut. - Sorry, I'll have to go at a faster pace. Therefore, in order not to be distracted, I will not talk. -Good good. I understand, of course. - But if we ... - No if. I had at least four seconds left. - It's okay if we're late. I'll take the next train. - The next one will be only tomorrow morning. Then you will definitely be late for the meeting. - We're meeting, we're meeting. What's the point? - Sorry, I can't talk. This is a difficult area. - Shut up, shut up. I am silent. Stop chasing! Stop, stop immediately. Stop transport. Stop. Stop. I won't go anywhere. I'll go on foot! - Everyone, they've arrived. What's wrong with you? You only have two minutes. - I don't have anything. I won't go anywhere. Leave me alone. - I repeat, you have only two minutes. - Leave. -All. Everyone, hand over the keys. Do you know that Illarion Stepanovich is in bed with a heart attack? They called from the traffic police, now they will come to deal with you. It's all your fault. Where did it take you? You saw that you didn't make it. - Why can't you do it? They did succeed. - We did. What if you crashed your car? Ruined representative construction trust. After all, it could be? - No, it couldn't. I was extremely focused and calculated everything exactly. - I don't want to count anything. I want to live in peace. Myself. No, these are my inventions. I'm taking you out of the car. You will go as a cattleman to the fifth farm. Understood? Cattleman. Shovel cow manure. Out of space straight into cow dung Here you can calculate everything in a minute. - It's probably interesting. I agree. After all, in animal husbandry there is a lot a lot of interesting. Here, here it will be output mammalian clone. - What, what? A clone is a group of animals with exactly the same genotype. To get a clone, you need to take an egg and remove the core from it, and introduce the core the eggs of the animal you want to get an exact copy of. - And then what? - And then this nuclear-cytoplasmic the hybrid will develop in the body of the already adoptive mother. So we can get a group highly productive animals. And in space it will be necessary. Flights will continue for more than one year. - That's it, nuclear-cytoplasmic hybrid, leave right now. On the farm, the second day no one removed the manure and that the manure be removed today. - Thank you, Ivan Petrovich. - The farm is listening. No, well, no. No milk, no milking. What, the chairman has arrived? - No, the chairman of the office. I was sent here to work. - Oh, what a job. There is no light and everything has stopped. The transporter is standing, the electrician was shocked, the locksmith got married, the cattleman's wife gave birth. He is happy doesn't go to work. - Show what, where. -Let's go to. Listen, go help. And I'll go. The women are evil now, they will beat you. - Hello women. - Hello. - Hello dear. - So. First, everyone should have clean bathrobes tomorrow. We're already erasing. - We erase. -Second - now everyone is cleaning the farm. - We can't do it alone. - And we are milkmaids, not cowgirls. -Hercules cleaned the stables of King Augeas, because he acted wisely. Let's throw manure through the windows, I will collect it with a tractor. And by the evening I will make a conveyor and bring food. - What are you going to bring? -Petka has not been plowing for the second day, the tractor is standing still. Bring it. - It's my business. - Oh, Hercules. -When will it be? When will he come? I do everything for the farm. -Sen, you persuade the women, and I I'll get it from underground. - No. No and no. - Look, I don't have time. You bargain here and I went. - Don't leave, I beg you. You don't have to leave. Scandal. There will be a scandal. - What? What? What? - All right, I'll call the chairman. - Do not call. - Do not call. - No no. I'll call. -I'll take action. Ivan Petrovich, it's not me, it's all Brusnichkin. And what can I do with it? Hand over? You to the phone. - Brusnichkin, I order you. - No. Until there is the application is satisfied, not a liter will come from the farm. -What the hell is an application? Where is she? -In the board. Application and my suggestions from the chief engineer. You. - Sent for the chief engineer. Reprimands. Okay, I'll pass it on. By evening, everything will be delivered - both wiring and spare parts. And now you can pour milk? - Senya, allow me. - Please. - Hello, where is Marina? -Come out, it's Simon. She is hiding from the commandant. -Why hide from the commandant in the closet? - Because they are being evicted from the hostel. - Yeah. I didn't retake the exam. Here, from the school I got kicked out. Now they are being evicted from the hostel. -It's clear. Look, there's no point in hiding. They will put another in your place. - Yeah. For now, I still have nowhere to spend the night. - Can you go home? - Yes, what are you? What are you? I've never been so disgraceful... Yes, I'd rather throw myself under the train. - Also Anna Karenina. - So you need to look for an apartment and work. What does Igor think about this? - Expresses sympathy. - So. Anu-ka go call him quickly now, Luba. - No! No no no. I refuse to interfere in my life. -Go, go, go. And tell him that I waiting for him here. - I'm listening to you. - Marina needs to find and rent a room. - What did I do? - What if I I can't do it today will also have to do. -Listen, what do you order me all the time? I warn you for the last time what if you interfere in my privacy... She needs to find a room and a job. -Let him go home. It is very difficult to rent an apartment besides, I have no money, to rent apartments. - I'll give you money. - Oh, then it's another matter. - Don't you find it strange, you going to marry her Will I pay for her apartment? -You don't have to pay. I don't have the funds to rent apartments. You understand, you're a bore? I am a student. - Are you going to marry her? as a student or as a man. - You, joker, I'll tell you. - Oh, Senya! Oh, they're coming. - So, I will try to persuade an aunt from our village, she will rent you a room. - No no no. The whole village will know about it. No, I do not agree to this. - Don't say you've been expelled. You still have to go to work. Here you will say you go to school. - There is no other way out. Gather things. I have my suitcase packed, just in case. - Because he's right. Why should people work in unbearable conditions? -It's temporary. Soon we will introduce the complex, we will liquidate the farm. - You will introduce the complex for another three years. Here are his calculations. And judge for yourself, Brylkin, it is too early to liquidate small farms, while difficulties with milk, meat. It's convincing. And in general, I like the guy. -He's a psycho. You know, he turns every day. You see, he wants to become an astronaut. -If he wants to become an astronaut, he can handle the farm. That's what, on the fifth farm you work drunken bum. The devil knows what he brought the economy to. I would recommend that you put this guy in charge of the farm, and when he shows himself to actually push him to you as a substitute. What's pissed off? Seleznev, is it time to retire? And this Brusnichkin real smart guy. Trust me. I would say master of the land. Initiative. Let's move it forward. -In no case! If he becomes yours You won't last a year as a deputy. He will turn everything around. Let go. Let go. Well, if he himself takes you to his deputy. And then you go to the brigade. No, no, you must resist. -How to resist? After all, this is a district committee. - I don't know how, but you have to resist. You can't resist him, you know? Well, he should not be allowed to approach the leadership for a cannon shot. Need to come up with something. Penochkin. - Who? -Penochkin has arrived. Leonid Vasilievich, Leonid Vasilievich. Anu, take a moment. Salute to the collective farm leadership. - Salute, salute. - Hello. Hello. - What, the management has some kind of trouble? - The management is always in order. Are you on business or are you? - To the district on business. And, by the way, everything is the same. The police are still in need of personnel. And the factory management recommends its best people to the police, and agriculture is lagging behind. -Yes, you, well. Leonid Vasilyevich, a cup of tea, huh? - No, I probably won't. -Who would recommend people to agriculture? I have no people for the police, I tell you like an old friend. - How not? How not? We have people. And very good ones too. Active, served in the army, has an interest in any risk. - Who you talking about? - About Brusnichkin. - Great guy. Second class chauffeur motorcyclist, studying foreign languages. - And mentally stable. - Send him to me for a conversation. - But the conversation, for now, is not necessary. I'll ventilate everything myself. I get an opinion Komsomol organization, the opinion of the collective. I will prepare this question. - OK, I'll wait for the results. -Hello. - Yes, cold. - You can refuse. Although not very pretty. It turns out that the team recommended you. And this is not for long. The police, of course, work not easy, but still cleaner than on a farm. -Thank you for your trust, but I have to refuse. I'm ready to do any job, if it's somehow may be useful for future careers. - Don't tell me. Oh don't tell me. Here, let's say you arrived to another planet, and there these, oh, back in the Stone Age. They need help organizing all life. And if the whole life is organized, someone will break the rules. This is where the police are indispensable. - I'm serious. - But seriously, Senya, thought about you. There are talks, rumors, things are bad with Marina. Yes, it will not be better if everything is at a distance. And you believe me if a woman hesitates you have to be with her. - Who is Brusnichkin here? - I. - Come on. Jokes on the first day of service. - No, it's all right. - Japanese? - I read, I understand. I speak worse. Bad pronunciation. - And French. - Yes sir. -Wait here. - We should check it out. - Necessary. How are you going to check it? I remember two phrases from the war: "Hyundai hoch and zetsendezikh. And fanster." Comrade Lieutenant Colonel, maybe you can check him out, huh? - In English, I could, but ... Here's what, contact the teacher's college. There they have some kind of polyglot, they wrote about him in the newspaper, speaks nine languages. deliver it here and let him examine it. What position have you put me in front of my colleagues, in front of the students, after all. Such peremptoryness. - Let's figure it out. -Comrade Captain, delivered by your order. -I don't understand why I should arrange this interrogation? - And who says interrogation? This is just a little advice. Professor, I will introduce you as our employee NTO - scientific and technical department. Clear? Here he is Brusnichkin, our hope. - This is our employee of the scientific and technical department. - Come on. Listen, where are you from? - From Laptev. -This is a village in the Verkhnepinsky district. - Comrade Lieutenant Colonel. - Great, great. That's what, why do you need the police? Come to us in the pedagogical laboratory assistant. Pass your exam and... - You want to say in the NTO. - Oh, sorry. I completely forgot that I'm from this very one, technical department. - Yes Yes. You are free, Brusnichkin. - I'm listening. - Sorry, sorry. He is clearly a gifted linguist. - Phenomenon. - What will he do with you? - We have a lot of things to do in the police and we also need smart, educated people. - Sergeant Brusnichkin arrived at your order. -Explain why you refuse to study material part of the motorcycle? - I know the material part of the motorcycle perfectly. It is impossible to know everything perfectly. In addition, folk wisdom says: "Repetition is the mother of learning." Or do you disagree with this? -Yes, I don't agree. Repetition of the elementary is a pointless waste of time. - You can refer to folk wisdom as you please. And to fulfill the instructions of the authorities and the police charter You are required. But the statute does not say about a waste of time. - That's it, I refuse to selectively attend classes. And I do not advise to stand out. And now I'll take your exams myself. Myself. So the task is the following - from here to the circuit and back. If I'm five seconds behind - you will study together with everyone. Clear? - Clear. - Everyone, let's go. - Excuse me, I have to check the motorcycle. - What else check? It is on these machines you will have to work. - Everyone, please, I'm ready. - Comrade Lieutenant Colonel, you are thirty-six seconds behind. What do we do? - What? What? Set a record, that's what. - Theory accept? - What the hell is a theory? Nominate him to regional competitions. - Sen, we are going past this house for the fifth time. Come in, while I'm going to the department. - Oh, who came? Who's come? Why didn't you come for so long? Do you really work for the police? -As you see. Oh what are you. You won't get bored. Now a cattleman, then a policeman. I wonder who else you'll be. - Whom I will be - you know that. -What do I think it is? The school principal asks: "Do you have connections with the police?" And they registered me quickly. Interesting, How did you explain who I am to you? - I said that you are my fiancee. - The policeman's fiancee. Oh, I can't. Yes, you are my fiancee. Nothing funny. - You, forgive me. I did not mean to offend you. I'm cruel, ugly. I... Thank you, Senechka. I don't have anyone like you. You are the best, the kindest, the most like this. - Comrade sergeant, urgently to the department. -I repeat, Vakhniak is a clever opponent. And to be clear who you have to deal with I will characterize him, so to speak, his creative path. Courses at the Institute of Radio and Electronics, left the third year.

And what? -Nothing, before the wedding will heal. - Take it. - Report from the first phone. Can you understand handwriting? - I understand. I told you, I had to put the phone down when offered. And you, three rubles, three rubles. - Don't chirp. -Don't chirp, don't chirp. You still don't listen to me. -Here's the ammo. You can take it for fear. Count on the furnaces, shot in snipe cartridges. -What are you standing for? Come on, run. Every minute counts. -Run Run. - Do you have more ammo? - If I were, I would. After all, the last time to hunt for ten years I went a while ago, but these two save in case. - Thank you. I went. -Wait. Let's go two. So it will be more convenient. - No, I have no right to risk your life. - You're still a sucker, I went through two wars, was in regimental intelligence. - No. You fulfilled your duty when it was necessary. And now everything, the objection is not accepted. -Then look here. When did you break up with him? - Nineteen minutes ago. -Ah, so he walked three miles and here he ran into a swamp. And he began to walk around here. What if he goes the other way? - If he's not stupid, he shouldn't be. He is more interested here, across the bridge to the station. If you don't have time, he will come out to the bridge before you. - Two kilometers? - Yes. -I'll make it. Let them lie with you for now. I'll go after them later. So after all it is necessary to recalculate, it is necessary so. - Once. - Well well. This. - Wait, I'll take it by weight. - If with me If something happens, hand it over to the fourth police station. - Ubeg. - Stop, hands up! Do not move. Klimov, cover me! All around. So. Calmly. To the tree, to the tree. - Yes. -Oh. What, Mariska, I can't be without you and that's it. I love. Okay, okay, look at that. Get ready. - Comrade Lieutenant Colonel, will you let him go? - I'll let go. Yes, I'll let go. Will try again in your aviation. Good days fall to the lot of reasonable people, but the best days go to those who dares to be insane. And let me be considered insane that let you go from the police, but I'm like a son to you I want to reach my dream. - Thank you. I will try. - I don't understand you, comrade lieutenant colonel. It's all weird, to say the least. What a brilliant employee you have now lost. -You are free.
