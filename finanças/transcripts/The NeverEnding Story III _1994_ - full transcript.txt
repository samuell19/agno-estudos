The Mountains of Destiny mark the highest point in the whole of Fantasia. It is here, in the Hidden Crystal Cave, that the Old Man of Wandering Mountain records "The Neverending Story". Now what? Now what? What now? Hold your horses! I'm finding out! There will be a day when the writing stylus will start to act strangely, making it increasingly difficult to record "The Neverending Story". This is a sign that the Nasty is on the way... An evil force that first takes hold in young humans when they turn away from books and reading. To stop the Nasty, even temporarily, would require a special young human... A voracious reader of great imagination and extraordinary courage. Nicole? Books listed according to the Dewey decimal system. Check the card catalogue... Shhh! "Shhh"? I'll do the shushing around here, young man! Shushing is the job of the librarian and not some snotty little kid with hair that looks like the rear end of a porcupine. Mr. Coreander? Mr. Coreander, don't you remember me? Bastian... Bastian Balthazar Bucks. Bastian? W.. W-what in the world happened to you? It's sort of hard to explain. I see. Why so far from home? Not playing hooky from school, are we? No. We moved. This is my new school... Unfortunately. I see. Well... Stay here till the bell rings, but no longer. Don't want to be late on your first day. "Treasure Island". I remember this from your store. Are the rest from there too? Uh-huh. "The Neverending Story". That is strictly a reference book from now on. It must not be taken from the library under any circumstances. It keeps going. Well, of course it keeps going. Every move you make is part of your story. Remember that the next time you pick your nose. Have to get more inventory from the car. Remember, "late first day, pay, pay, pay!" "The Nasties"? "One year after his second visit to Fantasia, "Bastian's father finally found a woman he wanted to marry... "A divorcee named Jane Baxter. "Jane's house was more suited for a family of four "which, for Bastian, meant a new room, a new neighborhood, "and worst of all, a new school." Honey... Where's Nicole? Oh, she'll be right down. "But maybe his dad was right and it would all be worth it. "All his life Bastian wanted a sister or brother "to share his dreams and confide in his secrets. "Now, at last, he'd have one." Hey, kiddo! This is a family effort. Do you want to help? They're not my family and this is not their house. Nicole. Dr. Dumont said this would take time, but you've got to meet them halfway. Why bother? You'll only get divorced again. Nicole, this is going to be different. I promise you. And just think what a cool new brother you have. Yeah. Real cool. This is my mom's sewing room, you know? She loves sewing so much. I'm really surprised she's letting you use it. I know I wouldn't. You can have one if you want. I got plenty of them. What for? Crystals are so stupid. Like crystals can really grant wishes! Please... Spare me this New Age garbage. Crystals aren't supposed to grant wishes. Only the Oran can do that. Oran? You can't tell this to anybody. Okay. The Oran is the necklace of the Childlike Empress, the ruler of all Fantasia. Please! I'm not making it up. It's all written. In what... A book? "The Neverending Story". And I'm listening to you like this is real? You are completely weird! So, you two getting into trouble yet? See? They're bonding already! Oh. ♪ I wish I still saw you ♪ Then I would be with you ♪ Days spent in the sun having fun ♪ Laughing alone ♪ But then something happened and you left me here ♪ All alone... ♪ Bye-bye, wife. I'll be home around 6:00. You look... Handsome. Thank you. OK, kids, let's get this show on the road! That was forceful. I'm being too harsh, aren't I? He needs more time. Take your time, Bastian. I can always write you a late note. Jane, you had it right the first time. I don't want him thinking I'm a drill sergeant. Downstairs! Look alive! Let's go! Yee-hah! Barney! Been doing it since he was three. Bye. Bye. I'll be pulling the car out of the garage. You know, when you're ready. You are not going to school like that. Like what? That is so un. "Un"? Uncool, unsophisticated, unhappening! Just... Un. "Un". Mm-hm! I'll show you "un"! You are so weird. Nicole! Everyone's waiting to see my new so-called brother. So-called? ♪ It has always been the same ♪ That's the call That's the game ♪ And the pain stays the same. ♪ Okay, kids, here we are. Nicole, wait for Bastian. Jane, would you happen to have a comb or a brush? Honey, I think you should have thought of that before. No, I don't, but don't worry. You look perfectly... Impressive. Really. Impressive. Impressive. Oh, my God, the new brother! Is he for real? I hope not. Hey, Nicole. Let's go! Nicole! Nicole! Wait! Where's the bathroom? I gotta fix up my hair. I can't show you right now. Oh, my God! Let's get out of here. Nicole! Nicole, come on! Run! Why? Who are they? The Nasties! The Nasties? What's up, little homey? Uh... Yo, what is it? Uh, I mean... Yo, what it is? Can you guys show me where the men's room is? Ah... Or at least tell me? Dog, should we tell him or show him? Ah, you know I hate those two-part questions, Slip. Yeah. That's 'cause you've got a no-part brain. Oh, okay. Yeah. This your first day here, squirt? Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Ha. Ha. I think it'd only be right we personally escort you to the men's room. Um, I can find it. I mean I really... Ah... So... You got a name? Bastian Balthazar... Bucks. Balthazar. What kind of name's that? You a Viking or something? Don't forget to flush, Balthazar. Yo, Mr. John. What's up? How many times are you dweezils going to repeat 12th grade? Till we break the record. Well, you ain't going to make it. Principal said the next time he catches you here, you're expelled. Yo, chill. We're only down here on a field trip. We're checking the pipes for ecological violations... Yeah. And... Stuff. Let me out! Open it. Let me out! Balthazar! Pal! Yeah! Um... No, no! We didn't lock him in there! Mr. John, we were sent down here to look for him. Just ask him. Ask him. Can you really have them expelled? Oh, yeah. They kidnapped me and locked me in there to die! Hey, Mr. John, can't we discuss this? I'm going to get you, Balthazar. Nicole! The story really is still happening. Gotcha! Help! Take me back to Fantasia! Come on! Hurry up! Come on! It's my story! Return to Fantasia! Escape the Nasties! Where is he? Where'd he go? Find him! Wash up first! There's a terrible root rot going around. Come and get it, sweetskins! It's your favourite... Frog and lizard puree. Don't bother me now, wench. Can't you see I'm observing the night sky? Same as yesterday and the day before that. OH! Aaaagh! Two months of root rot... I finally get to sleep and now this! Ow! Aaaagh! It serves you right for sticking your foot in other people's potions! If I was five feet taller I'd show you a thing or two, young man! Bastian? Engywook? Welcome back, me boy! Ha! Engywook! Sorry I wrecked your house. I must've taken a wrong turn... Somewhere. Ah, yes, well, inter-world travel is a very imprecise science. I wrote a paper on that very subject, didn't I? Yes, yes! Alright! It doesn't look so bad. I can fix it. When I get my hands on that slippery weasel, I'm going to rock his world. Ah... Yo! Maybe he's hiding in one of these books! Yo, Balthazar! Did anybody check in there? Yeah, just a pile of junk. "The Neverending Story". Hmm. Hmm. Ah! I don't believe I've read that. I must put it on my preferred reading list. Why don't you put "Learning to Read" on your preferred list first? Why you always dissing me, man? Why don't you look into the mirror and find out? Shhhh! "In order to escape the Nasties..." The Nasties? "Bastian rushed inside the nearest door of the school library." The Nasties... That's us! Now how can something that's happening right now... Be in this book? It ain't possible! "Slip, the leader of the Nasties, exclaimed to the others, "How can something that's happening right now be in this book?" Yo! I just said that. Yeah. "Yo! I just said that." That is so cool! Let me try. Okay! Um... The-the print's too small. You know what it is? Your brain is too small. The print is fine. "Safe at last among his tiny little friends, "Bastian settled in front of the patched-up gnome hovel, "chewing on the last tiny morsels of a gnome-cooked meal. "When he finished his account "of what brought him back to Fantasia, "Engywook popped a fresh toothpick in his nearly toothless mouth, "shook his onion-sized bald head and sighed to his human friend..." That's quite a story, young man. These Nasties sound downright... Nasty! Are you finished with your snake patties, dearie? Snake patties? Snake! Yeah, I'm finished. Where exactly is the book now, Bastian? It is in a safe place, isn't it? Well, uh... "It's safe alright." I smell wood burning! Well, if Balthazar could make up anything he wanted to happen in Fantasia while he read this book, maybe we could make a few things happen to him... While he's there. What are we waiting for? Let's get nasty! What's this? They said it'd be sunny today. Oooh! I think I'll take a raincheck here. Whoa! Careful! Watch the leaves, will ya?! Ooooh! Hey, something's burning back here. Oh, no, it's me! Quick! Call the fire department! Call anybody! Get me some baking soda. I'm kindling! Get up, you old fool! Get inside! Get inside now! Come on, you daft old bat! I knew this would happen! I... Yeeny macaroni! Oh, my sainted aunt! Me frogs! Me lizards! Me food processor! And me scientific experiments. My life's work ruined! Oh, my leaves! My lovely leaves! Get away! Leave me alone! Autumn's just beginning and I'm prematurely bald. Help me, kid! I need a wig! What about us?! Um... Ah... Nest! Get in his nest! No way! Man... What can I do? Ain't nothing you can do! I'm the king. You're my slave! The Nasties must have "The Neverending Story"! They're the ones making this stuff happen. Well, go back and stop them before they destroy everything! I can't get back without the book. There is one other means of inter-world transportation. The Oran. The Empress has the Oran in the Ivory Tower. Onward to Silver City! This is positively and absolutely the last time I'm flying! Falkor! Huh? Bastian, is that you? Falkor, land! Land?! I can't land down there. I need a runway. Come on, you can land anywhere. You're a luck dragon! A luck dragon, huh? If I was a luck dragon I'd be halfway to Vegas. It's not a dragon. It's an over grown pink poodle. Oh, no! I'm losing altitude! Look out below! Aaaaaaagh! Look out! Oh, I hate this part of the story! Aaaaaaaaagh! Wee! Falkor! Ow! I think I've skinned my snout. Falkor, you did great! Ohh... Am I still in one piece? We need a ride to Silver City to see the Empress. Not with me. I just came from there. Everyone's acting crazy there too. What about the Ivory Tower? Did the Nasty reach there too? Yes, they did. And the Empress? I heard she escaped to the Wandering Mountains. That's where we must go! Wait, that's just what I heard. It could be just a rumor. This is no weather for mountain flying. We'll have to chance it, you pink wimp! Bastian needs the power of the Oran to get him back to the human world so he can stop this thing before it ruins us all! Hurry up, let's go. Come on! With my root rot, I'm walking! Come on, Barky! Alright, alright! I'm sitting in the middle. You are not getting me up in the air in that thing! Not a chance! Hang on, Barky, hang on. Hang on to what? There's no handles, no seat belts, no in-flight catering. I'm getting a stiff neck from the draught. We should have walked! I... Want to get down! Oh, be quiet. Enjoy the view. Well... you wanna know what's next, Bastian? First we're gonna take over the Wandering Mountains and then the Hidden Crystal Cave. Then there'll be no place for you and your little freaky friends to hide! Someone's coming! Ooh! Shouldn't we clean up first? No. Leave it for that numbskull janitor. Bastian, were we? Bastian Balth! Shush, will you?! Oh, I hate birds! Mmm! Go away! ♪ I was born in the Rockies made out of stone ♪ I'm high like a mountain and I love rock'n'roll. ♪ Oh... Junior! I said no more rocks before lunch! I'm hungry. Now, stop! Did someone say, "Rocks before lunch"? Mmm. No! Honeykins, would you mind going over to Wandering Mountains and breaking off about a half a pound of limestone for me, hmm? For you, honeykins, anything. Oh. Mmm! Mmm! You still turn my lips to lava! Oh, go on now! Oh, Dadda, me come too! And don't forget the sedimentary sauce! I won't. Junior? Oh, Junior! Junior go buggy! Dadda, me come too. Pick up me, pick up me. Okay, Junior. Alright. Strong like your dadda. Help me. Dadda, help me. You can do it. Let's roll! Okay, Junior, let's go shopping!

It's so nice to have company. This isn't a social call, Old Man. A terrible plague has over run the Silver City. I was driven from the Ivory Tower by a force so powerful... Even the Oran couldn't stop it. Fortunately, I was able to, hmm, butt us through to the secret tunnel for our escape. Well... That's using your head. Mmm... It's no time for cheap head jokes. We must do something. What does the Great Book say? This evil force is known as the Nasty and comes from the human world. The human world? So that's why Oran has no effect on it! But how's it controlling Fantasia? Alas, I'm afraid the Nasty humans now possess "The Neverending Story". Well, then, get out of here! It's $5! Yeah, alright! You must go there. I'll use the Oran's powers to wish you there immediately. No. Hold it, hold it. Mmm? My dear Royal Empress of all that is wonderful and imaginative... What you need is a special young human, a voracious reader of great imagination and extraordinary courage. That's what it says in the Great Book. Here. Hmm... I shall call on the Oran. Oh, great Oran, bring me the human hero who will save Fantasia from the Nasty. Bastian! Oh, show some respect, will ya?! It's freezing in here. But it's a lot safer! Oh, yeah! I hope those stalactites are screwed in tight! Uh? Yeah. Ooh, ooh! My beloved Empress! I was so worried I caught the first flight... Shh! Quiet! Empress, how are you? Not well. But the Oran has brought me a hero to save Fantasia. Excuse me, your Royal Highness. May I make a humble little interjection here? Quiet, gnome! There's no time! The Nasty's on its way here! Soon, we could be at each other's throats. Good! Why not start now? Stop! We must not give in to the Nasty! Let the gnome speak. This better be good! Bastian's heart is strong. But he's not exactly Arnold Schwarzenegger in the muscle department, is he? No! Shut up! The Oran can provide the transport. But when he gets back to the human world how's he going to get the book away from these thugs? The gnome is right. Told ya. You will take the Oran with you. You shall wish yourself back to the human world, then use the Oran's power to return the book to the Keeper's safe hands. But... You must only use it to stop the Nasty. Then you must return it to me. Back, back, back. Get back! Give the boy wishing room. Here goes. Oh, kid! If you want to travel back to another world, Bastian, you'll have to wish harder than that! I can't. If the kid wishes any harder he'll break his wishbone! Hey, don't go too far, Junior. Come on! What's the big deal? Time for me to lend him a helping branch. Here, grab a twig. Come on, grab his ear, Bastian. Ohh, Bastian! Hi, Dadda. Junior, come back! Oh! It's Junior. Me play too. Hold tight! Hold the branch. Be careful! Dadda! Oh, me toes! Dadda, help me! But they've all gone! Ah! There's been a wish over load, you see. Don't worry, my tasty little toadstool, we're safe. You see, we and the others weren't making physical contact. Aaaagh! Ah! Oooh! Your body's gone! Well, your body went years ago! What the?! No. This must not happen. Fantasians, come back. They're lost, Old Man. Help me. What do I do? Oh, Empress, I'm a mere chronicler. What can I do? Bastian, can you hear me? I have something of great importance to tell you! The book! I wish "The Neverending Story" would leave the Nasties and return here... No, Bastian, stop! Empress? The Fantasians who helped you got caught in a wish over load and are there with you in the human world. You mustn't use the Oran's powers to stop the Nasty. Why not? Because the new Fantasia that follows will be different. It won't include them. It's my imagination. I'll just... Make sure they're in the new Fantasia. No, Bastian. You must find them. Bring them all together and bring them back to Fantasia before you return the book to the Keeper. Or they will be lost forever. Okay. I'm really gonna miss the old school! What's new? You've been missing school for five years! Yo, check this out. "Bastian always wanted a sister or brother "to share his dreams and secrets. "Now, at last, he would have one." Only problem is, he's stuck in Fantasia. Maybe we'll let him send her a postcard! Balthazar! He's back! Let's split. Hey! What if he tells the cops? Let him. We didn't do nothin'. He stole the book. It says so right in "The Neverending Story". Aaaaaagh... Wow! Something tells me I'm not in Fantasia anymore! Doesn't seem to be anybody else around up here. I hope I'm not the only flying creature in these parts. Oh, pardon me, Ma'am! May I talk to you for a second? I'm a little lost. Ay, where am I? Last time I'm making any wishes. Where is that kid? Uh, pardon me, ladies. Any of you seen a human about 1.5 roots tall, goes by the name of Bastian Bucks, hmm? Ahh! Don't worry, lady, I'm not gonna steal your pine cones. Huh, what is this place? Hey, uh, balsam, hemlock, fir, oak, aspen, maple even! Ooh! Look at the bark formation on that one! I've never seen anything like it! Is this a Greenpeace convention? Oh, no, chainsaw massacre! Oh! Ugh! Yuck! Uncle Rocky? Help, help! There's a murderer back there! Oh, no! Oh, God, I've gotta get out of this awful place! Oh, wait a minute! They're going over to second grade. Okay, let's move it out. That gives me... An idea. Mmm! Ooh! Yum-meeeeeee! I no like it! Hang on, kid, I'll save ya! Er... With a little luck. Hang in there, kid! Oh, oh, oh... Ow! Dadda! Here I come! Oh, Dadda! Gotcha! Ow! This won't help my back problem. I hungry. Huh? Okay, okay. We'll stop at the next rock pile. Ooh, goody! ♪ Hear the formality ♪ Get on the front seat... ♪ ♪ Show your personality Be who you wanna be... ♪ Honey, I'm home! It is so cool to have a nice family to come home to! Barney... Sis watching TV. How was your day? Fine. Great! Barney... And Bastian... I'll bet he's upstairs studying already. Barney, the school called today. It seems Bastian cut his first three classes. And he... Well, he stole a book... Something called "The Neverending Story"... From the school library. Barney... What are you looking for? Nothing. You wanna talk? I can't. I'm busy right now. Any, um... Problems with the new school? Making any friends? I'm fine, okay?! Okay. It's just that, um... Sometimes it... Helps to get things off your chest. This is all new to you. It'll be tough for a while. So, there's nothing you wanna? No. Dad? Yeah? Everything sucks. Okay? Okay. Guys, you've gotta find me. I'll never find you. The world's too big for a kid without a driver's licence. Who were you talking to? Uh, no-one. I was... Singing a song. It's country and western. My mom and your dad think you have gone bonkers. They're talking about having you committed to a mental institution. Oh, well. At least Mom will get her sewing room back. Oh, very funny! Oh, where did you get this... The Empress? Can't believe you actually expect people to believe all this stuff. I don't care what they believe. I don't get it. Why don't you... Just show us something from this Fantasia place of yours? I.. I... I can't. I wish I could, bu... But... I can't! Fine. Have it your way. "Bastian sadly clutched the Oran... "Unable to make the one wish that would set things right in Fantasia "and allow him to get on with his own life... "In the human world." "Bastian returned to his telescope "hoping against hope for some sign of his Fantasian friends. "As the night wore on, his eyes grew heavier and heavier "until he fell gently off to sleep." Because now I'm gonna rock his life in the human world. I'll make sure he never gets a sister. I like that. Um, Chief? You think maybe we should get our hands on that Koran thing first? It's Oran... You moron! But maybe you have a point. If those Fantasians can show up any minute now... Before we even get a chance to read about it, this book could go flying from our hands. Wait, Slip... Let's steal the necklace. And then we get the book... Forever. Permanent control over Balthazar's story. Falkor! Falky, look. Fantasia! Oh, I don't think so. But let's go check it out. Ah! Oh, pretty! Fantasia? It may not be Fantasia but there's some cute dragons here. Excuse me. Sorry. Heeeeey! You're nice! Falkor! Look over there. Where? Oh, yeah! Oh, boy! It's Bastion. There! Junior! Bastian. Oh, great. You two okay? Dog! Sic the necklace! I mean it! Just go! Go! Okay. Get it, Dog! Go! Don't be a wimp! Hungry, Bastion! Let's get out of here. Ha, ha, ha! Bye-bye! Bye-bye! Yeah! So long, my little fortune cookies! I'll be back! No Fantasia, Bastian. Well, genius, got any ideas where we are? Oh, yes. It's definitely the human world. The weather's so unpredictable. You see, there's this gigantic hole... Yes. And it's right in the middle of your face. Now, why don't you shut it? Shush! Oh, it's slippery. Come on. You're breathing rather heavily. Federal Express. There is one problem, my little squashed cumquat. We appear to be several thousand miles from Bastian's house. Oh, you nit-sized nitwit! No, no, I can invent a small flying machine, but it may take me some time. Ohhh! Good evening. Evening, Mr. McKenzie. When will it arrive? Ah, tomorrow afternoon. Come on. Get inside. I'll change the label to Bastian's address when the coast is clear. I hope we get some advantage miles for this. The Nasty could be at Wandering Mountain already. If it gets to the Empress it's all over for Fantasia. Fly faster, Falkor! Oh, yeah, easy for you to say! My back is killing me. Alright, let's head to my house. I'll stay there with Junior and you keep searching. Oh, alright. Oh! Mm-mm. Oh! You are home! I was beginning to worry about you and Junior with all this nasty weather. Ah... Where is Junior? Well, he's... Ohhhh. Where's Junior? Well, he, er... Where's the rest of him? He's in the human world. Ohhhhh! Oh, no. Oh, that's better. Bye-bye. With luck he'll find them by morning. Come on. Sleepy sleep. Oh, why is it always me? You'll sleep in here. Nobody will notice you. I'm tired now. Ah. Mmm. Okay. Right here. Don't come out for any reason whatsoever. Kissy kiss? Mmm. Goodnight.

You mind telling me why you're running all those machines? I just... Came down for a late-night snack and then I decided to sorta... Test to make sure everything in the kitchen was in working order. At one o'clock in the morning? Good work, Bastian. Yes. Always good to do that sort of thing during low-usage hours. Very cost conscious of you. Gee. Neat necklace. Thanks. Where did you get that? Ahhh... A pawn shop. A pawn shop? Barney. Come on. Let him be. Don't stay up too late, Bastian, okay? Sleepy sleep with Bastian? No, you can't sleepy sleep with Bastian. Ohhhh. Please. Okay, but keep it quiet. Oh! If that's possible. I happy! Come on, Junior. Tippy-toes. I'm not tired. Shhh! But I'm not tired. Another great idea bites the dust! Where am I now? Everything hurts.

Bastion Bucks lives here? Yes. Right. Thank you. Can you sign here? Sure. Thank you. Have a nice day. You too. "Living Things... Handle With Care." Let us out! Oh, no! There's no floor! There's no bathroom here! I've got to go! Ohhhhhhh! Bastion... There's a package here for you. And there seems to be something... I don't know how to say this... Speaking inside. Help us! Oh, um... This must be... Er... The parrot... I sent for. Um... By the way, have you... Seen Nicole? Er... She called to say she went to the mall. The mall. Okay. Bye. Shhhh! Stop! Let us out! Ohhhhhh! Candy? Let us out! There's no time. We gotta go. No! We've got to go! Ugh! Do you see what I see? Hey, that's it! If anybody says anything to you, just say, "Trick or treat?" Twick or tweat? Don't put words in my knothole. I'm 300 years older than you. You wanna end up in a botanical garden? Twick or tweat! Okay, trick or treat. This is so embarrassing. Oooooh! That's so gross! My costume's real. Where'd you get yours... K-Mart? Ooh, pretty! Yeah, yeah. She looks like leaf mould. If this is the way you humans amuse yourselves, take me back to Fantasia! What a dweeb! Okay, come on, guys. Balthazar's sister's right upstairs. Whooo! ♪ I'm so happy I'm a girl ♪ 'Cause I'm a girly girl... ♪ Oh, it fits so perfectly. I really wish I had this dress. You look just stunning in that. Darling, it's yours. Could you wrap it up in big, fluffy bows? Fluffy bows? Oh, gosh, I don't know. We're awfully busy. I really wish you would. Red... Or blue? Red. Oh, look! They're havin' a sale in the garden department! There's no time for shopping. Let's split up. If you guys find Nicole, bring her back here. Watch him. Oh, great! Leaves me with the mini-landslide! We go see toys! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Just don't expect me to change your diapers. ♪ There was a girl looking so delicious ♪ Standing at the bar in front of me ♪ The guy who touched her hand is looking pretty ♪ Now he's turned around watching me... ♪ Right, you've convinced me. I'll take it. ♪ I am so happy I'm a girl ♪ 'Cause I'm a girly girl ♪ Come over here, little boy We gotta twist and turn ♪ 'Cause I'm a girly girl I'm a girly girl... ♪ Hmm. A little more purple. You know something? In all the time I've been Empress, it never occurred to me to go shopping with the Oran. Well, that's because you serve a higher purpose, my Empress. Oh. Here's where we spread out and get the gold. ♪ We're livin' in a nasty world... ♪ Oooh! Funny! Let's see a smile here. Come on. Next! Me! You bully! It was my turn! Twick or tweat! Twick or twea! ♪ This is the time to change your mind ♪ Maybe together ♪ We can be strong so give a sign... ♪ Ugh! Bastion! When are you going to return that book? Mr. Coreander, have you seen my sister? I wasn't aware you had a sister. I don't. I mean... Not a real one. Look, I gotta find her before... The Nasties do! ♪ Don't believe an illusion ♪ You're never gonna change the world... ♪ Got it! ♪ Livin' in a nasty world... ♪ Whoo-hoo-hoooo! Hey! Come back here! Nicole, where's the Oran? He just took it! Ohhh! I've got the Oran! I've got the Oran! Had the Oran! Ooh! Aaagh! Nicole, hurry! She's got the Oran! She's got it! She's got it! She has got it! Come and get it, Balthazar! She's getting away! Hey! Wait for me! Ahhh, I'm going back to the garden department. Where'd they go? I don't know. They must've used the Oran to disappear. What'll happen if you don't get the Oran back? Don't you realise what you've caused? The entire civilisation of Fantasia will go down the toilet! And maybe ours will go down with it. I really hope you enjoyed your little shopping spree. Oh, Nicole! Now I'll be telling the story forever, Balthazar. Yo, Empress! Check it out, Wilma... I'm the new keeper of the book. My name is not Wilma. Oh! Yo, Large Head! What's up? And, um... Old Man, you've got more company coming. Then Bastian has failed and the Fantasia that we know will be a thing of the past. Let's get outta here! Barky! Let's go! Bastian! Come on, Barky! Wait! I'm not validated. Oh! Ow! Stop shaking us around, you great lump of lumber! Ah! It's gridlock out here! Hundreds of humans are testing out their air bags at the same time! These creatures are crazy! Why are they all being so nasty? Mr. Coreander?! Yo! Chief! What about the luck dragon? This is not my favorite part of the story. Looks like he's out of luck. Stay with me, Jane! Where is... Oh, God! There they are! There they are! Bastian! Why didn't you say you were coming here? It's like Armageddon out there. I keep telling you, let me know where you're going. Nicole, look at you. Nicole, would you take your stuff now, please? Where'd you get the money for all this? They gave it to me. They gave this to you? Nicole, sweetie, I don't quite understand. The stores just decide to give Nicole half their inventory?! I want the truth, young lady, and I want it now! I wished for it. What?! Barney, give her a chance to explain. Don't tell me what to do, Jane! See? I knew this would happen! Nicole! You come back here this second! Dad! The Nasty is controlling you! Don't give in to the darkness. Come on! This is so cool! No, no! Vile creatures, stay out! Let them in, you globe-domed geek! Empress, you said no cheap head jokes. So sue me! Huh! Honeykins, can you come in here? What is it now? Yaaaaa! Is that the best you can do? Ugh! Eeeeeow! Nicole! Nicole! Wait! Nicole! Nicole! Hey! Let me go! Your mom and my dad are at each other's throats. I don't care! You must! They're our parents! We're a family! No, we're not! It's better this way. Better to do it now. Do what now? Let them fight and get divorced. My parents used to fight all the time. First my dad would yell at me, then they'd yell at each other! It's all happening again! It's not! It's the Nasty! We have to stop it! You can't stop it. I tried. No matter what I did it didn't stop. They still got divorced. This is my story and I'm not gonna let it happen. Bastian! Bastian! Are you okay? What happened? I thought you were electrocuted. It scared me. Bastian, I'm gonna help you get the Oran back. Why should you help? At least this way your mom will get her stupid sewing room back. Bastian. Bastian. What? I look too "un" for you? Stop it! Unsophisticated? Uncool? I'm sick of it! You're a spoilt little brat! Stop it! It's the Nasty that's doing this, not you. You would never act this way. Don't you understand? You're too nice. Oh, yeah! I want it to be your room. I'm sorry for all the mean things I ever said to you. I want you to be my brother. You really do want me for a brother? Yes. I just didn't want to get hurt again. What are we waiting for? Let's go! Let's jam! Want to go home! Yeah, yeah. I miss Fantasia too. So do we! Alright! Alright already! We'll go back to the toy department. Hold your boulders, will ya... Whoa! "Bark Troll's branch pushes the dumpster aside "and then they step inside the Nasties hide-out. "And Bark Troll exclaimed..." "Oh, no! It's an ambush!" Hands off. Hey, don't touch the bark. I'm 300 years old. Show some respect. Kissy kiss? Barky! Come on! Vile crustacean! My Empress, don't give in to the Nasty! Empress! Help me! This is where we lost them. They're not here now. If I were six feet taller I'd pulverise you! You hear that? I did. Go! Come down to my size and I'll have you, my lad! Balthazar! What took you so long? You know, I've been reading all about your mommy and your daddy. Things are getting a little nasty over at the Bucks residence. You made it that way! No. You did! And you too. Don't go blaming it on me. I didn't put those words into your parents' mouths. They said it themselves. Don't you care about anything? You have to live in the human world after all this too. If you destroy everything it'll be bad for you! And you and everybody! He's right, Chief! Give him the necklace back. I don't want anything bad happening to my mother. Wanna know something? Something bad already happened to your mother. What? You! Oh! I've got the Oran! I've got the Oran! You've lost the Oran! Ooh, yeah! What are you doing? I wish... Nicole, the book! Big man, Balthazar... When you got the necklace. Put it down. Put it down! Then we'll see what a big man you are. In front of your sister! Don't do it! You've got the Oran! You can turn him into a duck. I frightened, Bastian. "Bastian placed the necklace down... "Then put into practice all those years of... Karate lessons." Karate lessons?! "Ha-ha! Karate lessons! Yelled Slip, bursting with laughter." What are you doing? I only took two lessons! "Bastian starts circling, waiting for his moment to attack." Go home, Bastian! Ooh-hoo-hoo! I'm sorry! That's what it says. To heck with what the book says. Careful, Bastian. Take it easy. "All at once, "it was if Bastian was transformed into a deadly combination "of Bruce Lee, Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme." Don't worry, Chief. It's just a bluff. "Bastian blocks Slip's attack and counters with a karate chop "and then... Kicks him away." I'll kill him! Come on! Go on! Go on! Give him a left! "Bastian turns from Slip "and performs a miraculous flying kick to Dog." Yes! Come on, lad! Careful, Bastian. I'm back! Falkor! "They see Falkor and... Run for their lives!" Get off! Get off! We go home now. Hooray! Ha-hah! Get the... Ah... Perhaps not. Oh, my God! What? Oh, no! What now, huh? "Meanwhile, back at Jane's house, "Barney and Jane's short honeymoon had turned into a living nightmare. "After only one week of marriage, Barney decided to call it quits." Let me see that. "And over in the Rockchewers dwelling, things were just as bad." Dadda? From now on, woman... I'm going to be a rolling stone! Fine with me! Hmmph! Fool. Oh, no! They've taken my story to the future! All this stuff's already happened. Don't come back! Don't worry, I won't! No, Dadda! No leave Mama! Hmm... No. Must be dreaming. No, Daddy! Don't go! Nicole? Nicole, Falkor's here now. We have to wish the Fantasians back before we get rid of the Nasties. Ah... I'm gonna miss you, kid. Bye-bye, Barky. I'll miss you. You too, Falkor. Bye, Bastian. Ooooh! Yes, you too, Junior. Bye, Bastian. I go home now. Alright, everybody, get in wish position. Good luck, lad. Dadda! We wish that Fantasia would go back to how it was before this Nasty business started. Oooooh! It worked! Barney! Barney! No! Please, don't go, Dad! Don't go! Nicole! I'm home! Are you okay? Hi, Mom! Bastian! I was worried sick about you, you crazy kid! Are you sure you're okay? You'll never believe what happened, Dad! Oh, I think I might believe what happened. Welcome home, Nicole! Dr. Dumont said it would work out! I hope you learned something, kid. Be careful what you wish... You might wind up trapped in a shopping mall! Me... I wish small. I got new leaves. I got a new lease of life! Bye-bye, Barky! Oh, ah... Look! There's your daddy! Go kiss him. Mama! Dadda! I'm home! My baby! Junior! Oh! He's home! If I can just get the root rot to clear up, everything will be fine. Hi. Bastian and Nicole! Hi! Nicole, you know my girlfriend Marcia. I do? Sure you do. You kids better run along. We mustn't be late for our classes. Heavens, no. Gosh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Bye. Bye. See you later. Bye.
