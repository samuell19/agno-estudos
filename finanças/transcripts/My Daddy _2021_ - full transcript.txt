Good evening, everyone. It is nice to meet you all. I am the pastor of this church, Kazuo Mido. Today... is Christmas Eve. Has anyone in here read the Bible from beginning to end? Oh... That many? Excellent. You'll have to tell me secretly what it says later. I think it's a little light. Mido, incoming. Welcome. This way, please! Alright! Alright! This way, please. Alright. Alright! Alright! Alright! A little bit more. Alright! Okay, stop! Thank you. Full tank regular, cash, right? - Yes, regular, full tank, cash! - Regular,full tank! - I did it! - Wow, nice one! - Nice! - Nice! Damn it! - Let's play one more game. - Yeah! I'm sorry. I have to go home. Not fair, Hikari. Running away victorious, huh? No, I'm not. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Okay, let's take another break. - Let's switch teams and play again! - Let's do it. Let's do it. ♪ The light and shadow of a shooting star ♪ I'm just looking at it ♪ Remembering the day you left, ♪ if I could be right beside you, ♪ I would tell you ♪ the answer one more time, I would deliver it ♪ Ah... You... ♪ You smiled even when I couldn't see you Sorry. Sorry. I'm home! Hikari! You promised you'd be home by 5:00 p.m. Hikari! Hikari. - Hikari! - I told you on LINE that I'd be home late. It's not enough to just message me on LINE. - Hey! - Move. I'm gonna get changed. You promised. You said you'd only help out at Christmas and Easter. I was just a little late, okay? So shut up. "Shut up"? Why do you talk like that? I mean, even you Dad is working part-time on a day like this. We're just barely making it this month again. Next year, I want to spend time with my friends. We'll talk about that next year. That's what you said last year. Oh, come on. I said It's okay. Ready to go? Okay. [ Silent Night playing ] Huh? That's not true. I was listening to you. Yeah, I know, but... It's so beautiful. Let's get something hot to eat and go home. No. Let's go home. I'll make you something. Good evening, everyone. It's nice to meet all of you... isn't it? Today is Christmas Eve. Have any of you here read the Bible from beginning to end? I didn't think it would be zero. But I understand. Even if you read it little by little, well, it would take two years. In two years, a lot can happen. In two years, an adolescent girl can change in the blink of an eye. If I say this, they say that. Looking at me like I'm disgusting. "Papa!" "Papa!" She said. Remembering the days when she used to wrap herself around me, I gently wipe away my tears every day. Now, I know we got off topic, but even if you've never read the Bible. "Love thine enemy," you may have heard of that phrase from the Bible. Thine enemies are those who attack us and hurt us, the bad people. Love the bad people. Why does the Bible tell us to do that? That's because God loves the good and the bad without distinction. Love is a wonderful thing. I... believe in love. There are other well-known Bible passages... "Cast pearls before swine." and "The scales fall from my eyes". Both of these phrases come from the Bible. Then there's this "Life is just like walking a long way with heavy burden", or so the saying goes. Is that also in the Bible? That was said by Ieyasu Tokugawa. Thank you as always. Okay. Thank you and be careful going home. - Father. - Yes? - Please consult with my son next time. - Yes. Now... he doesn't have a job, and just wandering around. Don't worry, I've been through that myself. Please I need your advice too. I'm struggling to relate to people at my new job. Must be hard for you. Relationships among pastors are also hard. - Father. - Yes? How can I get a visa? Visa? I'll look into it, and next time we meet, we can talk about it slowly. Okay. Thank you. Yes, thank you very much Thank you very much. Hikari. Hikari! She went home? Hikari? Hikari? What's wrong? Hikari! Hikari! Hikari! Hiro. Yeah? Hiro, you didn't use protection, right? Don't get me wrong. I'm thinking of having a baby one day, too. But if you have a child... Wouldn't it make it harder for you to debut? You know... I got the mumps and I can no longer do it. Huh? It's called male infertility. So, you know... instead of leaving a kid... I think I'd rather leave a song. Oh, I see. That's okay. Your songs will definitely remain in many people's hearts. They will listen to it a lot. I'm with you on this one. Yeah. An ambulance for anemia. Your dad would never disappoints, huh? It's not funny. I mean, the ones who won't betray you are us, right? - Ready? - Merry Christmas! No way, a cake? We were told we weren't allowed to bring it in. - Shunsuke hid it in his bag. - Because you want to eat, right? What's wrong? The cake is all messed up. - The hell did you do!? - Sorry. It turns out to be leukemia. What? Acute myeloid leukemia is a type of blood cancer that causes various symptoms as it multiplies. I suggest we start treatment immediately. - The treatment plan is... - W--Wait a minute. Leukemia? There must be some kind of mistake. I'm sorry to say this, but Ms. Hikari has acute myeloid leukemia. The first treatment is chemotherapy. If the reaction is poor, a stronger treatment, the hematopoietic stem cell transplant, may be necessary. Mr. Mido, are you okay? Y-Yes... Will your wife be here today? My wife... passed away 8 years ago. I see. I'm sorry about that. Would you like me to talk to Ms. Hikari? Or would you rather do it yourself? Hello. - Hello. - Hello. We're glad to know Hikari is okay. - Thank you for coming. - Excuse us. Hang in there, Mana. Mana! Patient coming through. Make way, please. Get everything prepared. You done paying? You can't go home yet. Why? Hikari, they found some illness. What is it? Leukemia, they said. You're lying. You'll be cured. You'll definitely... be cured. Leukemia. God... doesn't give us trials we can't overcome, right? Yes. I can be cured, right? You will. I'm not gonna die, right? You won't. Wish me luck? Good luck. Mido! - Come over here for a minute. - Yes, sir. Go on, introduce yourself. I'm Jin Ichinose. Actually, he's my nephew. Right here. See the resemblance? Yes. He's gonna start working for us today. Could you teach him a few things? I understand. I'm Kazuo Mido. Mido's main profession is a pastor. Don't take advantage just cause he's nice. - Pastor? - Yes. Then this way. Good luck. I know it's a little cold, but can you use this wet sponge to wash the car? I didn't know pastors had part-time jobs. I have to make a living. Really? Are you struggling? Wow, that's sad. So you believe in God? I do. Seriously? Yes. Then why are you in need of money? Isn't God supposed to help you? That curiosity is the first step to getting closer to God. I'll be waiting for you at the church. Live street performance at 5:00 p.m., please come. - Live street performance. - Okay. Please come. Thank you. We'll be waiting for you. Live street performance, please come. Thank you. - 5:00 p.m. - ♪ If I could be right beside you, ♪ I would tell you ♪ the answer one more time, I would deliver it ♪ Ah... You... ♪ You smiled even when I couldn't see you ♪ Ah... I... ♪ I wanted to send my voice out, to tell you I love you, ♪ And I want to be with you... ♪ forever Here you go. Please wait for a second. - Here you go. - Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Are you sure? You should be with Hikari. I was turned away today because her friends from school were coming. That's so Hikari. Please let us visit her next time. I think she'll be delighted. - Chikuwa? - Yes, it is. - Is this chikuwa? - Yes. They said it was his late wife's recipe. - It is? - Yes, it is. I'm just here for the curry, so stop with this heavy stuff. Mr. Chu, please come to my service. I told you, I don't believe in God. - Give me that. - Yes. Here you go. Here. Hey, Pastor! It stopped already! The cars are all jammed up. - Don't dawdle. - I'm sorry. Next, station 2. Cash, regular. I'm sorry. [ I will do my best too] [ Comment sent ] All people are faced with trials and difficulties countless times. But... God does not subject us to trials that we cannot endure. In the New Testament, Philippians, chapter 4, verse 6 and 7, it states: "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." God... has always provided a way of salvation. We pray. You did a great job. Yeah. Thank you very much for your help. Ms. Hikari did a great job. Thank you very much, Doctor. - Please, have a seat. - Yes. I repeat, periodic inspections will be required hereafter. If no recurrence in 5 years, the patient is considered cured. I understand. And, as for the test results... Test results? We looked into whether you and Ms. Hikari's bone marrow type was compatible. In case we need to do a bone marrow transplant. Ah... yes. As it turns out, it wasn't compatible. Well, the rate itself is low, which is understandable. I see. But Hikari was your stepdaughter, wasn't she? Idiot! What are you talking about? Excuse me. That's all for today. Wait... wait a minute. What? Stepdaughter... Why would you say that? He's still in training, he doesn't know much. Don't mind him. Hey... May I see that anyway? Um... please tell me clearly. As far as I can tell from the white blood cell type... there is no evidence of a parent-child relationship between you and Hikari. Excuse me? No, I'm just guessing... there was a mix-up at the hospital where she was born. No, there wasn't! I was present during the birth. It was a difficult birth. It took a long time. But right after she was born, I wrote "Hikari" on her feet, and the nurse laughed at me and said, "You're supposed to write the mother's name there." That can't be true! That she was with another man... What? What? I'm home. I got off work early, so today I... Don't move. Don't move! Hey, calm down. Calm down? All you can say right now is "I'm sorry". "Sorry, Etsuko, I fell out of love with you all of a sudden and I forgot all about you." And then I'll say, "I see, the first time I saw you singing, I thought, "What beautiful eyes, what a beautiful voice, what a beautiful song he's singing". Just like I fell in love with you, I can leave quietly thinking there was nothing I could do. I don't want you to think I was scum. Fucking scum! I'm home. Ah, I'm finally home. Wow, it's so clean. I thought it would be more cluttered. Dad, wash your hands and gargle. Yeah. [ Anyone is free to enter. Everyone is welcome. ] Hikari, you need to rest now. Yes. Good night. Good night. - Oh, I'm sorry. - No, I'm sorry too. By all means, feel free to use it. - But I'm bothering... - You're not bothering at all. It would be uncomfortable if I was here, right? Wait. I'm really going now. If you don't mind... would you mind helping me break some eggs? Huh? Oh, no, we can't break it. - Easter eggs? - Yes. Eggs to be displayed at Easter, celebrating Christ's resurrection. You break the shell at the bottom of the egg with disposable chopsticks and take out the egg without breaking it. - Like this. - Okay. This is quite difficult to do. Um, do you have a fork? What? I thought a fork would make a better hole for this. I have it. I'll go get it. Here, wipe your hands with this. Thank you. Oh! It opened perfectly. That's amazing. - It's easy to open. - This one too. - It's done. - Hmm? Who's that? You, Pastor. - It doesn't look like me at all. - No, it does. I'm not that heartwarming. Huh? That's not true. See? Just like you. Is it just the mole? No, please draw something that will please the children more. - They will be very pleased. - No, they won't. Um, I was wondering if I could ask you to help me eat the eggs. I will. - Thank you for the food. - Yes. It's delicious. I'm glad. But... there's a lot more, and all I can do is fry eggs. What? I'm good at cooking. Oh? I'm off. Bye. Have a good day. - Thank you. - Thank you. - No, uh, well, uh... your husband? - Yes. I thought I'd have a private detective look into it. No, that's... Because... he combed her hair. Look at that. Look. Look at that. - It's cute - So cute! And, look, he's so cheerful. Isn't it creepy? - I bet he's cheating on me. - What makes you assume that? No, I'm sorry... You have to trust your husband. Private detective... you don't need to do that, okay? Investigating your late wife's affair? Affair? Huh? Is that not it? Not the affair, but I want her relationships investigated. Sorry. Nowadays, 99% of the time, it's affair investigations. What about the other 1%? Looking for lost pets. Dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, ferrets, I find all kinds of things. Like asking for something, but it turns out to be a misunderstanding, right? A misunderstanding? Like, the dog was still at home? No way. That's ridiculous. No, it's not that. I mean, it wasn't cheating... Ah... When you get a hunch, it's usually right. Typically it is. Well, the wives that come in here, they're all angry, blabbing on and on. But... the husband, well... They still trust their wives. It's the same for everyone, really. It's not just you. Oh, you want more coffee? No, thanks. Now, can you tell me more about it? No need. - You still watching? - Yeah. - Go in the shade. - I'm fine. Hey. - What? - Pass. - Okay. - Pass the ball. Ouch. Ow. See you later. I want my money back. This one had a scratch here to begin with, and it's rusted out, stuck to... I don't know. I mean, you said if the dirt doesn't come off, I didn't have to pay it. Don't you lie to me. Excuse me... is something wrong? I asked him to wash the car, but he left that dirt on it, making excuses, so I told him I want my money back. No, that's enough. Get me the manager. Hey, hey... I said that's enough. Hey, Pastor. Hey... stop it! What are you doing? You'll scratch it. Sir, sir, if it's all right with you, we can talk about it over there. Are you in charge? This way, please. Please. What kind of gas station is this? Oh, Pastor. Hey, we've been waiting for you. Join us for a drink. I picked up a wallet earlier. Ah, no. You can't... I'm joking. I won it on horse racing. Let's go. We'll be drinking today. Hey, hey! You okay? You're drinking too much. I haven't drank this much in a long time. Come on, drink up. Come on. I'm sorry, Mr. Chu, for receiving this much. I like to be told "thanks for the food" once in a while. You're a good man, Mr. Chu. But I'm glad for your daughter. What? She was cured, right? You knew that? How many curries do you think I've eaten? I hear it all. Well, I noticed it. It must have been hard for you. Because I had a wife and a daughter, too. Well, they're both gone now. You know... I selfishly hoped that you wouldn't feel the same way as I did. Especially your daughter. Anyway, I'm happy for you. But I wonder why. I wonder why we don't notice it until after they're gone... How happy we were in our everyday lives. Hey, you aren't supposed to laugh. What? Are you crying? Mr. Chu, you really are a good man. Hey, hey, hey... Hey, don't cry. Come on. Hey, Pastor, don't cry. Come on. Let's drink. Oh, here. Cheers. Cheers. Okay, okay. Balloon, please. Thank you. Can I have another one? Thank you. Hikari. - Did you say thank you? - Yep, I did. Oh... You got two? One is for Dad. I see. Then let's get home quickly. - Yeah. - Let's go. - The blue one is for Dad. - Yes. Correct. - Pink one is for you? - Yeah. I'm gonna give both to Dad. Huh? Both? Dad, hurry up. Wait a minute. Mom? Mom forgot something. Wait here. Okay. What kind of rabbit is it? Hiro. Are you Etsuko? Been a long time. How long has it been? Is that your daughter, Hiro? What? Oh, yeah, that's my daughter. How have you been? You said you can't have kids, right? Did I say that? Mom. Dad. See you around, Etsuko. Hey, Mom. Mom. Please go out with me. We go home from school together... I decided to tell you when my hair grew long enough. Say something. Hmm. "Hmm"? I understand. It means okay. Really? Then... let's go home together. But I can't today because Miku and Nanami are waiting for me. What the heck... You guys can go home first. I just remembered something. Huh? Bye. Idiots. Hikari, what's wrong? Hikari? Hikari! Hikari! Is there a rice ball in it today, too? Yes, they're in there. What do you think they look like? Give me a hint. It's black and white and it's your favorite animal. I got it, Dad! - What? Dad? - Yeah. Did I get it right? Wrong. The correct answer is panda rice balls. Yay! Panda rice balls! I see. Your Dad always wears black and white. Yep. Sorry, Hikari. I love your Dad. Dad will probably hate your Mom. Why? Then, let's make chikuwa curry. Dad loves that, right? I'll help you, too. It came back? Conditions are more severe than last time. Chemotherapy alone won't cure her, she needs a transplant. Any donors? We checked with both the bone marrow and cord blood banks, but unfortunately, no matches were found. Ms. Hikari's white blood cell type is very rare among the Japanese population. The odds of finding a match is one in a few million. Blood relatives have a better chance of a match, don't they? - Hello? - Hello? Is Hikari there? No, I just dropped her off. Ah... I see. What's the matter? Oh, I'm in charge of dinner tonight, right? I forgot to ask Hikari what she wanted to eat. Ah, Etsuko, what do you want to eat? Hello? Hello? Kazuo, listen... Etsuko! Etsuko! Hikari... my daughter... please find her biological father! I have a favor to ask you all today. A personal favor. It's about my daughter, Hikari. Hikari's... leukemia has returned and she is now battling the disease. I need a donor for a bone marrow transplant. Everyone, please register for the bone marrow bank to help me save Hikari. I'm begging you. Please register to the bone marrow bank. Please and thank you. Please. Excuse me while you eat. Please register as a bone marrow donor. Please. Excuse me while you eat. Please register as a bone marrow donor. Excuse me. Please help me by registering as a donor. Thank you. Excuse me. Please help me by registering as a donor. Sorry for the wait. Your receipt. Here you go. If you would please take a look at this. A donor registration... I guess there's no such thing as God, huh? How are you doing? Your Dad has started using social media. It's where I call out for donor registrations. Now I have a lot of followers. And the more I do this, the more donors I'm sure I'll find. It's useless. That's not true. People all over the world are watching. Useless. The women's group from our church is going to register as donors today. - No way they're compatible. - We don't know that. - Pray with me... - That's so stupid! Hikari! Why aren't you compatible!? [ You have a new message from Shunsuke ] Hikari, how are you? Hikari, we'll be waiting for you! We'll be waiting! - Yeah! - Yeah! I'm sorry, it might be a little tight. It's okay. Because there's nothing else I can do. Calm down, please calm down! You idiot! That's why we said we're willing to donate. That's right! But without an address, when you're a match, we can't contact— Bullshit! We told you the address is right there by the river! - It's not an official address... - What official address... You're making fun of us, huh? Calm down. Calm down. Oh, I'm sorry. - Excuse me. - Here. - You found him. - Yes. Did he admit he's the father? Of course not. There's no way I'd approach him willingly. But the DNA test confirmed it. DNA test... how? There are many ways. Hair, chewing gum, used disposable chopsticks, toothbrushes, cigarette butts, and so on can also be used for DNA tests. But it has to be in good condition to be used for testing. Hair that falls out naturally doesn't have roots, so that's not good, and other conditions. Oh, you want some coffee? No, thank you. And you don't have much time, right? So I thought I'd make it quick. I pretended to be drunk, and punched him, and told him he was bleeding, wiped him up to take a sample. As you can see right here. Oh... I'm sorry. It's okay. I'll bill you for the treatment. Have a seat. But I wonder what his wife is thinking about now. A secret he should've taken to his grave has been uncovered. [ Kasumi Eatery ] Welcome. Have a seat. I'm home. Oh, welcome home. - Go wash your hands properly. - Yeah... Have you decided? Ah... Let's see... Chikuwa curry. Yes. Honey, chikuwa curry. Coming up. Thank you for waiting! Your chikuwa curry. Do you want some water? No, no. I'm too surprised to laugh. Wait, what about the hospital? I'm temporarily discharged. For real? - Let's go. - Huh? Excuse me. What? You are Hiroshi Hashimoto, right? Um... who are you? - Oh, good luck. - Here I go. That was amazing. - Really good form. - Wow! Home run... Oh, it's true. A home run. What are you talking about all of a sudden? Etsuko had my kid, and then she died. And leukemia? And bone marrow transplant? - I'm going home. - Please wait... Anyway, let me check your white blood cell type! - You're bothering me. - Please, I beg of you. - You're bothering me! - Please. - You're bothering me. - Please! - You're bothering me. - Please. I also have a family like anyone else! because I have a family. My wife would be surprised to hear something like this. I have a daugh— I have no intention of hurting your family! Besides, I don't care what happened between you and Etsuko. Just for my daughter's sake, for her sake, please let me test your blood! Besides... do you have any proof that she's mine? - A DNA test was done. - Huh? How? It's... Oh, by that. I'm sorry, but please, please, you have to take the test. - I'm not gonna take that. Get off me! - Please. - Let go of me! - Please, I beg of you. Please, please... Please, I beg of you. Please, please, I beg of you! Please, please take the test! Please, please, please. Please take the test. Please. I'm begging you, please! Please, please, please take the test. - Shut up! Let go of me! - Please, please... Please, please, the test... Please, please take the test. Please, please... I am begging you! Please, please, please. Please take the test. Please. Shut the hell up! Let's go home. Huh? Wait... Hikari? Hikari? Hikari! What are you doing? I wanna do it. I wanna have sex. - What are you saying? - I'm serious. - We can't. - Why not? No, because... - Are you scared? - No, I'm not. Let's just go home. Don't touch me! What the hell... Hello? This is Shunsuke Uehara. Shunsuke, what is it? Um... did Hikari come home yet? What? Good evening. What are you doing here? Are you alone? Come play with us? Let's go. Come here. Watch your step. What are you doing here all alone this late at night? Let me hold your bag. Dinner? There's this huge, good chicken place around here. Hey, let's take her there. - What the!? - What are you doing here? - The fuck you doing? - Come here. That hurt... You, come here. What the hell? Seriously? Hey, let's go. That bitch's fucked up, seriously. Are you okay? - I could ask you the same. - Let's go back to the hospital. I wanted to do it. I wanted to have sex. - It'll happen when you grow up... - I won't! Will I become one? I don't wanna die. You're not gonna die. I promise you I won't let you die. Your father... will make sure he comes with me. I'm sorry. We open at 11:00 a.m. - What? - I'm here to make one final plea. - So I don't care about that. - Please. Please listen to me. Please listen to me. - What are you doing? - Please. - Okay, just put it down. It's not safe. - Please listen to me. - Just put it down. It's not safe. - Please. Please listen to me. - Okay, put it down already! - Please listen to me. - I said okay! - Please. Ah, I told you okay! [ Temporarily closed today ] [ Entrance Ceremony ] - Hey, you really didn't know? - I told you I didn't know. Really. Please, can you help me? I really want to save my daughter. Please leave. I beg of you. We have a daughter too. I didn't mean to inconvenience you. Please don't come back to our house again. I will have him tested. What? Huh? What are you talking about? I will never, ever, take the test. This is the result of Mr. Hiroshi Hashimoto's test. - Mr. Hashimoto's bone marrow... - Yes. Unfortunately, it was not a perfect match for Ms. Hikari's type. No... However, 5 out of the 6 are compatible. We were hoping that all six would match, but it meets the criteria for a transplant donor. What does that mean? Let's transplant Mr. Hashimoto's bone marrow. Thank God. Thank you very much. We still can't be sure. Complications from marrow transplants are numerous, and some of which can be serious. I worry about Ms. Hikari's stamina, too. Still, a bone marrow transplant is what's best for Ms. Hikari right now... And frankly, I believe it's our only option. Please do it. Sorry about the other night. But it was your fault to begin with. Aren't you here to apologize? I am... I'm still not sure if I like you that much. Boys are just children. I'm sorry. I'm kidding. I really don't know either. Yeah. Hikari. We found a donor. Really? What... Hey, Shunsuke? Who's coming today? It looks like Shunsuke is coming again. Again? He was here two days ago, too. - He's been calling me a lot lately. - He's so in love with you! - Ah, Hikari. - Oh, Mana. - How are you doing? - Not so bad. - What about you? - The worst. - Are you sick? - It's bad. Too much free time is killing me. You really had me worried there, okay? Nothing we can do about your boredom. Think about getting well first. Okay. See you around, Hikari. Hikari? See you later, Mana. Who was that just now? He must've gotten the wrong room. Mom. Dad. See you around, Etsuko. Hey, Mom. Mom. Good luck. No. Huh? Something's not right. - What's not right? - Are you scared all of a sudden? What's wrong? Who's the donor? Hikari, we're not supposed to tell you who the donor is. I'm asking Dad! I'm sorry, can we... talk privately for a bit? Dad, you know who it is, don't you? You said it that night. "Your father will make sure he comes with me." It was like you knew... who was compatible. Tell me everything. Who is the donor? Hey, who is it? If you won't tell me... I won't get the transplant. The donor... is your biological father. You are... the child of your Mom and the donor. Your Dad didn't know about it either. You and I... were not blood related. But... you have nothing to worry about. All you have to think about is getting cured. Let's go. Was it that guy? That guy? I... really hated it when Mom talked to him. I don't want his marrow. What are you saying? My only father... is you, Dad. Mom loved you... because it was you, Dad. That doesn't matter. - No, it is not. - It's okay. All... All I care about is saving you. That's not okay. It's not okay at all! Are you doubting Mom? I loved Etsuko... and I thought she loved me, too. I thought we were happy. - But I was wrong. - You're not wrong. - She was happy. - Then... it's happiness built on lies. I am not blaming Etsuko. It's just... I'm done with it. I want to know the truth. I want to know, but I also don't want to know, and I'm so confused... But... I don't care anymore. It's not because Etsuko is dead. Even if she was alive, the doubts I have would be endless, and she wouldn't even know it... You're suffering right now because of me. You're wrong. I don't know how to say it... and I can't prove it, but... She loved you and I very much! So don't tell me you don't care! All... - All I want is for you to live. - That's not good enough. - Why!? - It's just unacceptable! I don't want you thinking that way! Because I know, and I really know, and I won't accept that you don't care. Dad, Mom loved you! Dad... Mom... Loved me. Etsuko... loved me. I... loved Etsuko, too. I know that, your Dad knows that. Thank you. Thank you, Hikari. You... were born for me and Etsuko. So... please, live. Live... You wanna fall in love and have sex, right? Live and be happy. Will you, Hikari? You can do it. You can do it. You can do it. Hey, you ready to go? Yeah, I am doing it now. It's already time. I know. Move. You're done. - I'm not done yet. - It's okay. - Your hair, it's done. - You're already done. - My clothes are a mess. Look - Because I'm not done. I told you to wake up. I tried... but I fell back asleep. I mean, you could have woken me up. You should learn to wake up on your own. - Shut up. - "Shut up", don't say that. - Oh, come on. - It's okay. Shall we? Yeah. - Yo! - You've done it. Thank you very much. Today is Easter. On this most important day of the year, to be with my daughter, Hikari, I can't find words to express how grateful I am. I'll be honest. There was a moment when I couldn't believe everything. Yo! Damned Pastor! But now more than before, I believe deeper and deeper in love. The one that made me realize that is God, all of you, and... my wife and daughter. A moment of happiness always gently illuminates life. It made me realize that life is a collection of those moments. So, with thanks... Hooray for Hikari's resurrection! Hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray... - It's Jesus' resurrection, though. - It's Jesus' resurrection, though. Hooray!

Oh, thanks. - Here. [ My Daddy ] [ English subtitle brought to you by ECOTV ] [ QC: rjgman56/Furritsubs ]
