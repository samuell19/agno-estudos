When I was a kid, I went to the most beautiful place on earth. Hey, get back here! Hey! My parents were both there, and they were very much in love, and they gave me that love to remember. Love doesn'’t just fade away. If things fall apart, you keep going. You Don'’t stop, and you Don'’t give up, '’cause if you give up, you'’ve lost. Dad, you ever hear that song, "they saved Hitler'’s cock"? No. No? You want to hear it? - Yeah. - Yeah? All right, it goes like this. You ready? ♪ They saved Hitler'’s cock ♪ ♪ da-na-na-na-na ♪ they hid it under a rock ♪ I discovered it last night ♪ I couldn'’t even believe my eyes ♪ ♪ and Hitler'’s cock, it started to talk ♪ ♪ it would say to kill today ♪ if Hitler'’s cock could choose a mate ♪ ♪ it would choose Sharon Tate you know who Sharon Tate is, dad? - No. - No?

And, dad, you remember that old bike we used to cruise around on? Huh? Yes. Yeah? I still got that bike. I will repair it for you. Oh, you will, huh? You'’re gonna repair it for me? - Mm-hmm. - That'’s good. That would be great. I'’d like that. Hey, pop, I got to turn you around and wash this crap off your back. Hmm? Come on, turn around.

I got the hot ones, '’cause Paul o'stina says that the mild ones have more flavor, but I said, "hot is what we eat." Did you wash that pan? Don'’t ever wash this pan. There are nuances to the flavor that come from the pan. Oh. Don'’t waste a plate. Just put on the bread. Hmm? It tastes like blintzes, pop. Just eat it. Pop. Hot, hot, hmm? Pop. Pop. Pop, are you asleep? Pop, are you asleep? Yes. Oh. So what'’s the difference between a normal and an abnormal psyche? Mr. Toadman? Anybody? A normal psyche contains the average values of the society in which it exists, and an abnormal psyche is a variance from the societal norm. Thank you, Mr. Stein. Next Tuesday, we'’re gonna look at why it'’s important for all of you to have normal psyches. You know, I spend a lot of time... A lot of my time working on the syllabus for this class. I could have been fishing or spending time with my family, but I already know what an abnormal psyche is. Hey, hey, hey, hey... Hold on, sweetie. Thank you. Do you want a dip? No, thank you. I can give you a nice blow job. I Don'’t have any money. Fuck you, then. Come on, baby, get some. Huh? I'’m sorry. Yeah. And give me back my motherfucking lighter. De napoli motorcycles.

Why did we even do that shit? It was, like... '’cause we were kids. That'’s why we did it. We were kids. Well, we'’re adults now. You know, you want to hang out or... Yeah, I do. I got to do something. Then I'’m gonna come back. - All right. - All right? Cool. Hey, when you come back, can you bring me a sandwich? Get the fuck out of here. Take it easy, man. Take care.

Why Don'’t you pull over right here? Right here. Okay. All right, you give me $100, and I can get you ten bags... And a 10 for the hookup. You just want $10? No, 10 is for the guy that gets it for me. I'’m just gonna do this '’cause I'm stupid, I guess. Oh, that'’s so great. Well, no, I mean... you want to... you want to give me the money? Oh, yes. Oh, I thought that... I thought that you were a cop. A cop would have charged you more. Here you go. Five Don p, five m16. Do you want to do some of this? No. No. Thanks, though. This stuff is kind of chunky. It'’s not really breaking up that well. Do you want something to press down on it with? No. This is gonna be okay. My favorite part is scoring it... And fixing it up... Plus the people. So why Don'’t you just buy it and then throw it out? Well, really, my favorite, favorite part is falling asleep. I love sleeping. Well, good night. Where'’s the restroom? Go out the door and make a left, go through the workroom. Don'’t be frightened by the old guy. Somebody else lives here? My dad. Your dad? It'’s cool. He just lays in bed. You should just go. Okay. Let'’s switch shirts. I'’m not really able to have sex right now. That'’s okay. I just want to make out a little. Pop? Girl here to visit you. Hello. Hello... I'’m gonna let myself out. Let me just call the elevator for you. Jesus. Whoa. This is really comforting. This is really comforting? Shut up. So what does your dad do? You just saw him doing it. He used to be a professor, taught engineering, and ran a business from here. Where'’s your mom? She'’s dead. Listen, I Don'’t even know your name. No, you Don'’t. Sorry, Stein. Bye. She'’s weird, but she'’s cute, very cute. Do you realize that she'’s the only eligible girl that I'’ve hung out with in, like, a year? You know that? I'’m gonna get your pills together so you can move around and talk more easy and plus the stuff that stops seizures, a vitamin, some sustacal and some orange juice. Okay, all right. All right? Then we got to go out. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay. Messing with me? Huh? Messing with me, huh, huh? Ready, ready? Yes. I'’ma check the mail, all right? Yes. Do you want to open the door?

I am an aunt. You do look tired. Somebody here for Mr. Stein? Yes. Come with me, please. He'’s going to have to stay here for at least the next few days, and it may make sense for us to have him here on a more permanent basis. That would also be better for you, drew. Are there any tests you can do to see what'’s causing the seizures? Well, he'’s already been through quite a few tests. He has some symptoms of Alzheimer'’s, and he has some symptoms that are not related to Alzheimer'’s. It'’s very complex. Is he awake? He'’s still unconscious, but I can let you go in for a few minutes. Please. Drew, he looks so old, but he'’s not an old man. He just looks tired. Has he been getting worse? Yeah. He'’s going to have to stay here for at least the next few days, and it may make sense for us to have him here on a more permanent basis... He has some symptoms of Alzheimer'’s. Pop?

This is one thing that I was gonna wait a while before we talked about. Maybe we'’ll talk about it now so you can think about it. Because you all... We all have to make some kind of plans for ourselves. It'’s a free concert from now on. But the one major thing you have to remember tonight, when you go back up to the woods to go to sleep or if you stay here, is that the man next to you is your brother. And you damn well better treat each other that way, because if you Don'’t, then we blow the whole thing, but we'’ve got it right there. Hey. What'’s up, b? Come and hang out over here. I got to go. Chill, man. Catch you later, b. Yo, let me get a bag and a needle. Scariest thing to me, scarier than dying, is being alone, so you hold on. You do whatever it takes, because if you let go, there'’s nothing left. You are alone. My father'’s not the man that he was. He'’s not a ghost, but he'’s not himself. If you love somebody more than anybody else, do you own them? I mean, when they can'’t take care of themselves, make their own decisions, do you become the one who makes '’em? Dad, is it okay if I lay down with you? Yeah. Yeah? I'’m just gonna lay down, okay? Where does my father exist now? He'’s not in heaven. He'’s not in heaven or whatever because I see him here in front of me. But he'’s not really here either because if I ask him his name, most of the time, he won'’t remember it. He'’s not himself. Maybe he'’s only really himself in my memory. He exists in me. Pop? I'’m not gonna be able to take care of you anymore, pop. It'’s all right. It will be all right. I'’m very sad. Oh... I love you, pop. Yes. I fucked up. You know, I fucked up, and I'’m not gonna be around to take care of you anymore. I'’m gonna go. I'’m gonna go make a better life for myself someplace and just make you proud of me, okay? I'’m not sure... i'’m never sure if you ever really wanted to live. I... Love you, inside me. I'’m gonna get you high. I'’m gonna get you really high, and you'’re gonna feel nauseous, and then you'’re gonna feel warm and comfortable, like you'’re being hugged, okay? Yes. That'’s okay. ♪ They saved Hitler'’s cock ♪ ♪ they hid it under a rock ♪ and discovered it ♪ and discovered it today ♪ last night ♪ I couldn'’t ♪ ♪ even ♪ even believe my eyes ♪ it both: ♪ Hitler'’s cock ♪ ♪ it starts to talk ♪ it would say ♪ say to kill today I love you, pop. When I was a kid, I went to the most beautiful place on earth. My parents were both there, and they were in love. They gave me that love to remember. You know, maybe if you really love somebody, you'’re never alone because you'’ve got them in your heart. And when you'’ve got nothing else, they'’re there inside you.
