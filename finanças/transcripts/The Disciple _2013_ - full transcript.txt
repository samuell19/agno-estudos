Långfilm Productions presents a film by Ulrika Bengts THE DISCIPLE Father! Father! The boat! I'm looking for Lighthouse Master Hasselbond. Where is he? What is this? Thirteen, but still can't tell the difference between right and left. Your hands! My name is Karl Berg. I have a letter from Pilot Boat Captain Hallström. I'm the new lighthouse keeper. Age? Thirteen, I'll be fourt... - I already have a kid here. Stay in the sauna until the next boat. Thank you, sir. Once there was a King with three sons. Two of them were wise and cunning, but the third was a poor simpleton - whom everybody called Stupid. When the King got old... - Is he leaving on the next boat? Yes. When the King got old and knew the end was nigh, he felt perplexed... Do you think Father will let me play with him until then? - Maybe. Do you know what he wrote? Hallström. I'll have to make do with the boy for now. If he can't find anyone before autumn, - he'll have to make do without a lighthouse master, too. That'll show him - how easy it is to replace me. How do you tell between a rectangle and a square? All sides of a square are equal. Which makes this a...? - A square. How do you get the area? - You multiply the side-length with the other. And this? - A rectangle. The area? - Multiply the side-length with the other. And this? - A triangle. More precisely! A right... - A right-angled triangle. You multiply the side-length... - Well? Side-length by side-length.. . I know this! - You think you do! Have you gone to school? - Not a proper one. But a little? I'm a good teacher. What do you teach? - Numbers. Calculation? Five plus five? - Ten. Correct. Take away three. - Seven. Oh, that's too many. - You said take away. That's minus. You're mean. You're right all the time. What's that? - I won't tell. You know everything. No, I don't. - You promise? It's Mommy. - Do you have a piano? Not exactly. - What do you mean? Here, I do the asking and you do the answering. Eight. - What's eight? Ten minus three makes eight. Wrong! Wrong! The square of the length of the hypotenuse equals - the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Only if it's a... - A triangle. A right-angled triangle. - Right-angled triangle. You're just a parrot. You can't think for yourself. What's all this about retaking your exam? You already failed fatally once. Do you want to humiliate me again? I want my diploma. Let me show you I can. Until tomorrow. Gustaf! - Yes, Father? She'll sail by today. Soon. You may hoist the flag. - Thank you! She'll sail past today! - Which way? From the southwest. Come on! Come with us! A frigate. The 1700s. It took me years, but I wanted it to be perfect. It's magnificent! Imagine sailing the seas. To Oceania, - the Caribbean, South America. Are you good at calculation? - Yes, pretty good. If I can get my diploma, I could join a ship's crew. - And then? I could be captain. Will you help me with the numbers? - I'll try. We had this to go by. Is it yours? He got it from his older brother Elof. - Emma! Father, did you see the Linden? From up there? Can we go and see her when we go in for my exam? - Be quiet! Excuse me, sir. - Yes? The days are going by. It is getting bor. .. - Get to the point, boy! I'm used to working. Let me help. - There's nothing you can do. I'm a fast learner, sir. - Move along now. I'm strong, too. You can go down and clean the fish. - Thank you, sir. Just for today. I'm not promising anything else. - Thank you, sir. Your turn. I'm sorry! Karl! The diameter divided by two is 12.5. That makes the area equal to 3.14 times 12.5 times 12.5. Where do I start? With the radius. The decimal point is wrong. You need two there. - 12.5 has only one. 12.5 times 12.5. You need two digits after the decimal point. You see? What did they say at school? - Never went to one. Father's taught me. Have you been on this island all of your life? - Yes. That must've been wonderful! Would you stay here if you could? - Yes. Stop! Come in. What's on your mind, young master Berg? I came to fill the tank, sir. Since when is it your responsibility to fill the tank? Take it back and have the real lighthouse assistant bring it up. Young master Berg should join him. That's correct. - Thank you. Did you calculate it yourself? - Yes. Show me! Hands! - But... Do not question me. One... two... ...three. Thank you, Father. And you, young man. That was for aiding in cheating. Let this be a lesson to you. Take a bow and thank me. Thank you, sir. You must stop annoying him. It came here to die. He can't see us here. Get undressed. Father said there's a boat coming tomorrow. You can hide here until it leaves. What's wrong with you? I can't breathe in there. In the dark, locked in. Where? In the orphanage. The cable goes to the lighthouse. He's a hard worker, that boy. He said he's coming back with us. Aren't you pleased with him? He's only a kid. The earpiece. You talk into this, and the other person hears you. Do you understand? Is someone in there listening? This is Lighthouse Master Vilhelm Hasselbond calling the Port Operator. Come in, Port Operator. Answer me! What is this? Operator. - Good evening, Miss. This is Karl Berg, Lighthouse Master Hasselbond's assistant on Sydskär. Good evening, Mr Berg. - Please put me through to the Pilot Boat Captain. Please hold. So, it's installed now, is it? - Yes. How's the boy doing? I don't have anyone else to send. You know that. I will let you know soon, sir. -Are the others returning tonight? Yes. - If the boy's not with them, it's settled. Good evening, sir. Dorrit would have made dinner, but Sköld seems to be in a hurry. Yes, we'll be off then. Do you know how to heat up the sauna? Show him. But leave us alone then. Strindberg? Are you interested in reading? - Anything I can get my hands on. So, you've had an education? - Some. But no diploma? I have a book by Strindberg, too. The People of Hemsö. Have you read it? - No. Get undressed, boy. You're not shy, are you? Get in here. Don't let the heat out. Hallström wrote that you're hard- working and patient. I've seen that. And that you've been raised in an orphanage. Show me your back! If you can take that kind of punishment, you've got what it takes. I assume you didn't scream? I don't scream. I've learnt... - What have you learnt? To know what's best for you? To speak when spoken to? - Yes, sir. Do you want to stay here? Become a lighthouse keeper? Anything but being sent back. - Anything. Not enough. Without goals and ambition, you get nowhere in life. You can stay for now. But remember, I will have no mercy. One violation, and you'll be sent back. - Thank you, sir. Emma will show you how to use a knife and a fork. I won't tolerate any filthy table manners. Come with me. The reflectors focus the light. On clear nights, it shines dozens of sea miles away. You fill the tank every day. That's Gustaf's job. He'll show you. You'll stay here a few nights with me here. Sleep late in the mornings. When it gets dark and the nights get long, we'll take turns. Actually, Strindberg once worked in a lighthouse. So you're in good company. - Thank you. This is the log for every day. If something happens, call the Port Operator. You know how to use the telephone. Father is asleep. He asked me to show you the routines. After that, I'm allowed to take you out to sea. Do you know what this is? A sextant. It allows you to calculate your position. You measure by the sun. At night, you use a star that you know. Like Sirius? - Yes. You look in this tube and aim at the horizon with the horizon mirror. Make sure this arm has its mirror angled so that you see the horizon. You turn the arm so that the mirror is towards the sun. The angle between the arm and the horizon mirror - will equal the angle between the tube and the sun. Then you read the angle from this index bar. The sun's angle on this list will show where you are. Longitude and latitude. - You're like a Captain already. Father doesn't know I know this. I've never shown him. I'll take my exam first. After that, I'll surprise him. If he's proud, he'll let me go to sea. Do you want to become a lighthouse keeper? - Yes. You know, I'm so glad you came here. May I join you? - You're just a little girl. This is for big boys. Don't be sad, my little one. Chin up! Run along to Mommy now. Correct! Remember that Lector Ajander will give you less time. You got this from your brother. - What? "E.H." Elof Hasselbond. You can't swim, can you? You know what to do with your legs. Gustaf? - Yes? Don't stop. Onwards with your arms and legs. Why won't you talk about him? Your older brother. Father said we'd better not. - He is dead. Turn your palms out. How did he die? - All I know is that Elof drowned in a storm - when he was saving people in distress. I was only six. Father said he died a hero. No need to be shy with me. Sit down. Sit still! That music... it was so... Would you like to hear it? The music? Can you play? - Twinkle, twinkle, little star. That's so beautiful! It's Elof's music. I have to go now. To relieve him. There's still time. He goes by the clock. I want to do what's right. You really want to stay! Do you know what this is? - A sextant. What is it used for? - To calculate your position by celestial bodies. So you know how?. Do you want to make a calculation? Measure the angle between the sun and the horizon. Where is it? - It's bed time now, Sally. Emma, did you take it? I've told you not to touch my things. You've got it here. - Leave me alone! I know you do! Give it to me! - Mommy! Where is it? - That's enough! No! She took my sextant! - I did not! Think. When was the last time you saw it? Good! Now the latitude of our position on the map. Good! You'll take the shift tomorrow. I need to go to the mainland. Thank you, sir. It's mine! - Let go of me! Now I remember what you're good for. Karl, come with me. Get me the Port Operator, but hurry up! This is the Sydskär lighthouse. There's a ship in distress! Yes. Get a fix on the ship? Excuse me? On the map with the compass to the north. Pointing at the ship. Bearing 260 degrees, Storklobben. - Bearing 260 degrees, Storklobben. If it's for sure? Yes, it's for sure. Excellent. They're sending out a rescue boat. The ship hit the rocks portside and damaged the helm. Not a single member of the crew was hurt. It's almost a miracle. Thanks to a young man, Sydskär's new lighthouse keeper, Karl Berg. Your trial period is over, Karl. Congratulations. Can you help me? - Coming! You can brush your hair now. Come on! There you are. No, I'll have to stand behind you. Not so tight! The jacket... And the hat. Let's see. Oh, you look so good. This room belonged to my first born, Elof. It's yours now. Elof's? We loved him dearly. That was his lighthouse keeper's uniform. He barely had time to use it. Elof wanted to go to sea. Sail the seven seas. Elof had ambition. Like you, Karl. It's important to use one's talents. Put it on. It should suit you. The Pilot Boat Captain and the others will soon be here. Welcome, Mr Pilot Boat Captain ! - Thank you, Vilhelm. Hello, Dorrit. I have some treats for the Mistress. Karl! Bravo! And a lollypop for Emma. How's Sally doing? All she does is eat and sleep. - That's good. And there's Gustaf. Welcome, Lector Ajander. And this is Karl. - It's an honor to meet you. Everybody's met? Let's go. I see you've hoisted the little flag, not the big one. The big one is for ceremonial use only, according to regulations. I was only joking. As clean and orderly as usual. You're a credit to your profession. Thank you, sir. - Unless the boys have done most of the work. Congratulations. The inspection is over. Passed with merits. As you all know, we have a new colleague after Arvid passed away. From an old and tired lighthouse keeper to a young and fit one. I'd like to take this moment to welcome you, Karl. Both to your new position and also to our family. I've looked into adopting Karl, and the authorities don't object. I want to remind the Pilot Boat Captain of the promised colleague. It isn't quite certain that Karl will stay with us for long. Lector Ajander has kindly promised - that Gustaf gets a second chance at the exam, and Karl can try, too. You may practice with these assignments before the exam. Thank you, sir. In September, - there'll be a sailor's vacancy on the cargo ship Andromeda - that sails as far as Australia. The boy that passes the exam will get it - and, at fifteen, start his education to become first mate. As we all know, this is the first step towards becoming captain. Dorrit! Where's the old piano? I haven't heard you play for years. Do you still have it? It's up in the attic. Bravo! Farewell, Vilhelm. - Farewell, sir. Karl, get the can! - Excuse me? The petroleum can! - But I already filled the tank. Get the can and bring it to me, I say! No! I'm the one calling the rhythm and tone here! Don't do it! Father! - Yes? Well, Father... - Yes, what is it? It's about Karl. What about him? - He can't swim. Really? He can't go to sea, then. Spreading gossip, are we? - No, I just thought Father should know. You should know he already told me he can't swim. May I teach him? - You're lying in your Father's face! Don't you think I saw your smirk? I'm sure Karl will learn how to swim. Sooner that than you pass your exam. Get out! Furthermore, I'm going to tell Karl not to spend time - with a petty weakling like you. The ruler, please. The volume of the globe. The radius times radius. Quiet! I'm only trying to understand. - Look in the exercise book. If you're not helping... - How will you pass if you keep asking for help? Then don't! Can cream and strawberries make you sick? Are you sick? - No, Sally is. I gave her cream and strawberries yesterday. Her tummy is funny now. Try here. - Like I said, something funny is moving there. Haven't you asked your parents? - No, Sally is my dog. It'll pass in a few days. When she's had her pups. Pups! Do you think we'll get one each? You should ask Sally. They're hers. Did she really eat strawberries? - Of course, they're delicious. Are you going to...? - Not today. Can you take that box? It's Elof's. - The one you played last time? No, that's this one. How could he compose such wonderful music? How can a bird fly or a fish swim? So, he could've become... - Anything, if he'd been allowed to. I thought... - What? That he wanted to.. . - Become captain? Not my Elof. He lived for music. But his Father got him a job on a ship. He banned music, for us both. The funny thing is - that it was music that once made him love me. Elof didn't have a choice. - But he died a hero. Says who? - Gustaf. He knows nothing. He worships his Father. As long as he obeys, he'll be safe. Now Father wants to make you his. Is that your dream? Would you like to have him? Would you want him as a father? - Don't talk like that about him. He's been good to me. You're a fine boy. Don't let him ruin you! Gustaf, you are and will remain an idiot! - Yes, Father. Where's Emma? Emma! Emma! What is this? Can't you keep an eye on the brat? In this family, we dine together. Maybe she's in the shed. - Quiet! He's coming. You must get out. He mustn't see! See what? Emma, dear, why are you keeping secrets from your Father? Gustaf, get a bag and put weights in it. - Father... Do as I say! - Daddy, no! Had I known about the pups, I wouldn't have let you keep it. Put them in the bag! - No! Karl, show me you're a man! Gustaf, take her away. You know what to do. No! One day, the Princess came to a giant's house - and sat down by the gate to take a rest. There where huge bowling balls and pins big enough for giants. Emma! The Princess lined the pins up and threw the ball at them. The Giant looked out the window. "You little worm", he shouted, - "how can you play with my pins?" Good night, then. - Good night. Death Certificate Calculate the area and the volume. Ten, nine, eight, seven, - six, five, four, - three, two, one, zero. Swedish. Karl has passed both spelling and grammar. Gustaf has passed both arithmetic and algebra, - but also, surprisingly, geometry. Karl has passed all three with merits. We're all pleased and happy. - I knew it! No more school for you, Gustaf. Congratulations. Congratulations to you, too, Karl. Well done! May I leave the table? - Stay. There's another matter at hand. Emma? Have you been playing with my key ring in the lighthouse? I didn't think so. That leaves two possibilities. Have you seen your brother or Karl play with my keys, Emma? No. The question is: Did this person find what he was looking for? Why was he looking in a forbidden place? This someone - who borrowed the key to rummage in my cabinet - has the opportunity to speak up, - so I won't have to punish both of them. Come back, Gustaf! You can't run away from this. - Leave him be! We'll get to the bottom of this. - It was me. Excuse me? I'm the one who peeked in the cabinet. - What did you see? I was looking for another book, but couldn't find one, and locked it up. For a thief and an urchin from an orphanage, you're a bad liar. It's righteous of you to cover up for Gustaf. I will let this pass - if you promise me once and for all that this won't happen again. No more lies. No more covering up. Now go and help Gustaf cast the nets. Why did you do it? What were you looking for? You said Elof died a hero. - We're talking about you now. Elof was no hero. - You don't know anything about that. He didn't want to go to sea. He only went because of you Father. He wanted to be captain. - No, you should be one. Why won't he let you? He would have if you hadn't come. - Do you really believe that? You're the one who broke the sextant. I wanted to show him. You measure yourself against your dead brother. - Why didn't you admit? You don't need to. You know you can. - Why didn't you say it was you? I did. He thought I lied. You're lying! - Your Father is a tyrant. Shut up! I found Elof's death certificate. - Shut up, I said! You can't take my place. I'm the one who'll become captain! Karl? Father! - A boat is the most valuable thing we have. You left it adrift! Karl fell overboard. He can't swim! Are you lying to me again, boy? - No, Father! I saw you push him into the water. Karl opened the cabinet! - Stop lying! He doesn't want to be captain. He says you are... - Don't lie! Let me go on that ship. Stop it! Is he telling the truth? - What? You don't want to be captain. - I don't care. I want out of here. This is worse than the damn orphanage. - Mind your language! No son of a bitch can boss me around! Not a tyrant like you. I'm embracing you like a son and giving you a future. You already have a son. - Gustaf will be the lighthouse keeper. That's all he's good for. Elof was made to become captain. There, I said it. That's the way it will be. Elof killed himself. I found the death certificate. What are you going to do? Whip Karl into submission? Just like Elof? I must show him I'm in charge here. - You forced him to go to sea. You couldn't force him to live with it. Everybody knows... ...that Elof drowned himself. It was your fault he died. Stop it, or else... - Or else what? Are you going to whip the boy senseless, - rape me to get a son to torture? Unless it's another girl. - If you love life! Mommy! Say that you'll show gratitude. Say that you regret. - Never! Where's Father? No, Gustaf! He'll kill us! Karl, Gustaf. This is Mr Persson. Erik, Gustaf Hasselbond will enlist on the Andromeda next week. This is Karl Berg. - How do you do. I've heard about you. Going to sea, too? - Not if I can avoid it. Please, sit down. - Thank you. Mr Persson will take over as Lighthouse Master immediately. A lighthouse engineer will study the damages tomorrow. Hopefully, we'll install an acetylene-gas light very soon. Right, Karl? These are modern times we're living in. Can we eat now? Persson and I will stay the night. You boys will help Dorrit pack. There's no need to. We can leave today if you like. And Father? Your father isn't capable of working out here anymore. I'll do my best to find him a position on the mainland. Can I visit him? I'm not going to lie to you, Gustaf. He said he never wants to see you. You neither, Karl. You, Dorrit, he's willing to forgive. Shall we pay Daddy a visit, Mommy? English subtitles: Janne Staffans
