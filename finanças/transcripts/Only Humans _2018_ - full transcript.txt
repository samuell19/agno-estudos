(UPBEAT MUSIC) NANCY: I talked to Vivian. She said Madison made head cheerleader. Good for Madison. Could be good for you too. Maybe she could get you on the squad. I'm not interested. Aw, come on, you'd look so cute in one of those little outfits. Never gonna happen. (BRAKES SQUEALING) Oh, my God, Jesus. The car in front of me just stopped short. Because there's a stop sign. You should be more alert. Well maybe if you were actually teaching me how to drive and not putting on your lipstick. I think you inherited the bad driving gene from me. No, I just need more practice. You promised we'd go twice a week. Why don't you get a boyfriend to drive you around. Right, right, your solution to everything. Well when I was your age, I had several. What about Evan? Evan doesn't drive. Anyway, the person has to be over 25. Why don't you ask your dad? You'll mind him, he has a daughter. (BRAKES SQUEALING AND HORN HONKING) God! (HORN HONKING) Hey, learn how to drive! Oh, that must be Silvia's son. Poor thing. (SPRINKLER CLICKING) You must be Vince. Uh, yeah. So good to finally meet you. Your mom told me so much about you. VINCE: And you are? - I'm Nancy. - Oh. I live next door, and your mom was a wonderful friend. Aw, thank you, it's very nice of you to say. And this is Sarah, my daughter. - Hi. - Hi. She's shy. So how long you gonna stay? Just to get the place ready. Ready? We're selling it. Of course. Is Elizabeth coming? No no no, just me for now. Well, please, if there's anything you need, don't hesitate to come by. VINCE: Okay, I appreciate that. Just me and Sarah, don't be a stranger. All right, it was nice meeting you both. You too. (CHUCKLING) SARAH: What? He's cute. SARAH: He's younger than you. So? SARAH: So, isn't that like against your rules? You do have a point. I don't have time to waste on a younger man. Glad you've thought this through. I'm going in. Come on. Curvy, feminine, fun-loving woman in her mid-40s, no, in her prime. Looking, hey, Sarah! Sarah! SARAH: What? Will you come here a minute? I wanna show you something. For a, should I, come here, I wanna show you. Look, come here. Mom, I really wanna finish this piece. Oh, you can take a break from your painting for one second. Just come here, look. All right, what do you think that... Is that, curvy woman in her prime? All right, look, can you please take a picture? Because, I tried to take... Can you just take a selfie? I did, look at this, it's terrible. Yeah, you have to hold it higher. Up, higher. Yeah. Is that how they do that? See? Good, okay, have fun. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DOOR CREAKING) SILVIA: Hi, Vince, it's Mom. I just spoke with Margot. Honey, I hope you're doing all right. Call me back, sweetheart. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Vince, it's Mom again. Why aren't you returning my calls? I hope you're taking care of yourself. I know how you can get. Call me. Love you. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BLENDER MIXING) (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (PHONE RINGING) (SIGHING) Hey. EVAN: I'm outside. I'm busy. EVAN: Come on, open up. Ohhh. (BIRDS CHIRPING) So I wonder if Sarah will go to the new Transformers tonight. SARAH: Forget it. Come on it'll fun. No, I wanna keep working on this. Can I see it? No. Come on. Show it to me. Just once. Dream on. (PLATE BREAKING) (COUGHING) Oh my God. Are you okay? I'm fine, thank you. Let me help you. Oh no no no no no no, ow, don't do that. Oh sorry. It's okay, it's okay. Gosh. Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna get this place cleaned up in a month. A month? Yeah, actually a little less than that. Oh my God, you need help. Hold on, Sarah? Check out this video, it's just a little fuzzy. NANCY: Sarah? What? NANCY: Can you come down and join us please? SARAH: Evan's here. It's okay, just for a second. Fine. Come on. NANCY: I have a great idea. What's up? Vince just told me that he's only got a few days, well a few weeks, to clean out his mom's house. Okay. And you need driving lessons. Oh, I doubt that she wants to spend her summer cleaning up my mom's, I don't think that's a... If she wants to get her license, she does. I've been very busy. Maybe if you didn't go on all those dates. SARAH: Honey, please. Thank you, but I'll figure it out, I will. You really need help, don't you? And you really want driving lessons, right? So now's your chance. Perfect. Okay, I gotta go, so why don't you help Vince clean up this mess now? You stink. I gotta bounce. You don't have to do this, you do know that, right? It's the only way I'll get my license before I'm 30. But if I'm in your way, then I... No no no no, no, I could actually use the help, so that'd be great. Okay. How about we get started tomorrow? That'll give me a day to organize things. Okay? Sure. VINCE: Cool. See ya. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) I need a sexy, this is not a sexy one. (CAMERA CLICKING) (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (CAMERA CLICKING) (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Hey. Oh, hey, how are you? At least you organized all this stuff. Yeah, I didn't quite get as far as I had hoped. So where should I start? Uh, good question. Let me show you around, and then we can figure it out, yeah? Cool, watch your head here. So we need to go through all these. I think most of this side and that there is probably my mom's stuff. My sister should be coming sometime in the next week or two to get her stuff too. And yeah, so, I guess that's it. Sorry, so that's, tight quarters. That's the tour, I guess. Ohh. So, what do you do in the real world? I'm getting my PhD in philosophy. Cool. How long does something like that take? In my case, like eight years. Is it supposed to take that long? No, not exactly. So what's it about? Ethics. What about ethics? Acting on the motive of duty. Basically, arguing that we can always do what is right. But what if you don't know what's right? Well, once you recognize what you oughta do, then you can actually do it. Okay, but what if I think is right isn't what other people think is right? Who decides what's right anyway? I guess you'll just have to read my thesis. Yeah, I'd like that. (LAUGHING) VINCE: No, you probably wouldn't actually. So how do you like Findlay? Whatever. The teachers are good, they pretend to care. I don't know, I'm just ready for whatever's next. When I was there, all anyone cared about was football, or theater. Or theater? (LAUGHING) Then nothing's changed. So what is next? Oh, um, I guess I'll start on one of these boxes. No no no, you said you're ready for whatever's next. I'd like to travel. Go to Europe, see some art. Europe's great, I spent some time in Spain after undergrad, actually almost stayed. I'd like to go to Germany and Austria. What's in Austria? My favorite painters are Austrian. Like Egon Schiele, Kokoscha. No idea, never heard of them. They've totally shaped my style. I guess that sounds pretentious but there's just this intensity to their work, like it grabs you. I want people to feel something when they look at my paintings. So what do you think about this guy? SARAH: Mm, no comment. What, this beautiful explosion of primary colors doesn't move you? Come on. So what, donate (LAUGHS)? Is it that bad? Trash? It's for the best. You're killing me. (SOFT UPBEAT MUSIC) (Nancy laughing NANCY: Shh, don't wake up Sarah. MAN: We wouldn't want that. NANCY: Nooo. (NANCY LAUGHING) Stop it.

(GROANING) - Thanks. - Of course. Ahhh. This trade-off requires no heavy lifting for you, all right? Got it. Who's hungry? What happened to your girlfriend, Vince? I mean, your mother made it sound like it was pretty serious. Just didn't work out. Wanna be more specific? VINCE: No, not really. I'll find someone for you. VINCE: I'm good. I mean, if I were 10 years younger, I woulda found her already if you know what I mean (LAUGHS). Everyone knows what you mean, Mom. Mm-hmm. There is a girl at work, though, that I really like, she's nice and pretty and, I think she's single. I'm good, I'm kinda taking a break from relationships right now, but thanks for the offer. You're almost 40. You don't have time to take a break, don't you want kids? I don't know, I can't really answer that question. It's the greatest pleasure of life, look, well not that she's a prime example. VINCE: Sarah's actually been a huge help already. She's been really great. That's a nice thing to say. I am really glad this is working out so well. Okay, I have to go. Be good, you two. Bye, thank you for the food, Nancy. NANCY: You're welcome. Interesting woman. She certainly has a lot of energy. That's a nice way to put it. So what do you say we drive this stuff to Goodwill tomorrow? Yeah. No, I meant, I meant you drive it. Oh. Yeah, okay. I mean, that's the deal, right? Isn't that we agreed to? Yeah, mm-hmm. Cool. Is she always that chatty? Yeah. And full of opinions? Yup. Hey. What the fuck? The door was open, didn't you get my text? No, I was helping Vince. Who?

(CRYING) But you'll get over him. No, I'm not as strong as you. What are you talking about? I can't just bounce back like you do. Oh, oh, okay. Well, that takes years of training. You get better at it as you get older. But it does still hurt, every time. I never see it. Well, I don't want you to see it. I don't want you worrying about me. I'm sorry. You don't need to be sorry. You're gonna be all right. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) You're gonna be just fine. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (CAR DOOR CLOSING) (CAR STARTING) (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Jesus Christ. Sarah, what are you doing? You're leaving? I know this doesn't make any sense to you right now. I do, but that's how it has to be. I didn't tell her, I swear. Sarah, you didn't do anything wrong, this is my fault. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Sarah? Look at me. Stick with the painting. I mean it, okay? I will. And give your mom a break. She really does love you. I'll try. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) I should go.
