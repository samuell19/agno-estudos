We can live to 100 now. We should do what we love during all that time. How long will you live like this? You should settle down and get married too. Let me give you some advice. There are two conditions for marriage. Money and an attractive face. You're attractive. It's just too bad about your hair leaving you a bit early. Even Jang Dong-gun would be ugly if he was balding. Forget the appearance. Then what's left? Money. Make a fortune with this place! But I've never done a business before. What's there to it? It's all up to you! Find your niche. Do something different! - Deal! - Deal! - Stamp it with confidence. - Okay. - Success depends on it. - Okay. Success. What will you do after I take over? I should chase my dream, too. DETECTIVE AGENCY POLICE UNIVERSITY DIPLOMA BRAVE CITIZEN AWARD BRAVE CITIZEN HELPS SOLVE A MURDER CASE - Aren't you going to work? - I am. - Honey. - Yes? This month's living costs. I was so worried you'd sell the comic shop to become a detective. - I'm off. - Okay! How long will you stay mad at me? Don't touch me. I didn't say anything when you got demoted since I knew it was tough for you. But you're refusing a promotion and doing what? A detective agency? I told you about it before. The private investigator law will be passed, and I have to be the first to take the lead in the field… Later. WHERE ARE YOU, BEBE? Bebe? They never mention how much the reward will be. Why would anyone help? COLD CASE COMMUNITY NO NEW POSTS Is there anything fun? No. I was checking for new cases online. Oh, is there anything interesting? Nothing. What's the going rate for finding lost cats? Cats are too fast. You can't catch them. Right? Jesus! Excuse me… Come in! Please have a seat. GRAND OPENING Top class dishes, tons of freebies! Please order from us. Here you go! Okay. - Please take a look. - Sure. Thank you! It's lunchtime already. What do you want? That place sucks. Did you even try it? No, but it's obvious. The current time is 12:25. It's lunchtime rush hour, but the chef is handing out flyers. A place like that won't have good food. He's the chef? Didn't you see his hands? He had inflamed fingers, a telltale sign of a chef. I do dishes at home, and I get plenty of that too! Plus, his rubber boots. Why would he wear boots on a sunny day? Chefs wear them in the kitchen since it gets wet easily. Delivery guys wear them too! Come on. Listen. The flyer says "Kangdongwon." But I saw his delivery case through the door. It said "Monggo Chinese Food." Restaurants on the verge of going under often change names and start over. Don't you remember Monggo? We ordered from them when we started here. They were stingy on side dishes and tasted like crap! It's so salty! Don't order from here. With all that evidence, how could you not know? Are you a detective? Did you make up that crap about the White Shark? Listen, Dae-man. Do you think adultery, scam, or lost pet cases are below us? Are we some kind of third-rate private agency? We should have pride as detectives. How can we do such stuff? Pride? What's that? Do you see me as a joke since I gave up the force to sit here with you? Let's be real. You like playing detective, getting treated like a hero online, right? You have no sense of reality. What have you done with your heightened sense of reality? I made sacrifices too, you know. I gave up my booming comic shop business! As an ex-cop, shouldn't you bring cases to us? Why should I be the only one doing that? What did you say to me when we started this? You said the 70,000 community members will help. You told me to trust you! What's with him? Honestly, you couldn't even pay your shop rent. Right? Forget it. Let's implement an incentive pay system. What? I didn't want to do this out of respect for you. I'll bring cases with the help of my members. But we split it 70-30. What? 70-30? If you can bring in cases, take everything. You're old-fashioned so you might not know, but these days, everyone makes requests online, through mobile devices. Do you know what social media is? It's like… You know… Anyway, we've got to change the way we work. That man's a pervert! He was in the women's bathroom! I'm really sorry. I'll buy you dinner. Please let him off, just this once. Promise you'll treat me to a meal, then. Thanks! - Dae-man. - Yes? I got you off the hook. Go before our captain arrives. Your commissioner gave me a Brave Citizen Award. Your captain's no match for me. You were caught in the act as a peeping tom! And at a police station, no less! Leave us alone. We're busy! Please reinvestigate this! It's not a simple accident! - Please! - What's going on? That case has been investigated and closed! No! - Go! - That's not true! Don't come back here. If you reinvestigate, you'll find… Shunned by the police? I can help you. I'm Kang Dae-man, a private detective. I'll lock you up for misdemeanor! I'm leaving. See you, Detective Cho. - Sure. I won't see you off. - Okay. Come on… - Give me a call! - Please go! Korea's best detective agency! It's not. ATTORNEY-AT-LAW YOO BYUNG-IL Hey, Gwang-jong! Okay, fine. I'll call you! - The world will change. - I have a client. Hello, sir. This way, please. - But hear me out. - It's a tough time. - Wait… - I'm sorry. - Hear me out! - No need! I'll just leave this here! - Okay! - Give me a call! Don't post that there! WANTED WHERE ARE YOU, BEBE? How do you catch something so fast? GWANG-GYU "Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet." You have to endure it. Screw that. Your wife is here! What? Was it good? Thank you. Come back again. See you soon. The second one? Have a great meal. Thank you. Welcome! Dude, you didn't tell her? She caught me off-guard! - You're here! - Yes… Why didn't you call me when it got so busy? You even got Gwang-gyu to help around here. Thanks for your help. We really appreciate it. - One ramyeon, please! - Alright. You didn't have to come. What about the kids? Oh, it's time to pick up Gun-woo. - Get going. - Okay. - See you at home! - Okay. What happened here? I did some thinking when business was slow, and I realized comics weren't what I loved the most. Then what? Eating ramyeon while reading comics. It's all thanks to you. You said so yourself. Find my niche. Be different. Thanks, buddy. I bet I can get married soon! Oh, man… I NEED HELP! So he needed help because the shop was too busy? Let's eat raw fish today. Send. Is Mr. Kang Dae-man here? You finally came. This way please. Please sit here. Thank you. Would you like some tea? Green tea? Coffee? My fiancé went out to buy fruits, but he didn't return. I reported him missing, but they told me to wait. Then I heard he got hit by a train and died. Pardon? Could you explain further? When I became pregnant, I moved in with him. I was with him that night. That looks so yummy. - I'll go buy some. - It's really late. Our baby wants some, right? I'll be back soon. - Hurry back! - Okay. MY BABY He didn't come back after that, so I went to the police to report it, but they said to wait. I asked around at the factory he used to work at. He lived at an orphanage, so his colleagues were his only friends. Did Jae-min ever come here? Not recently. Why? Did he go somewhere? We have a notice of death for Kim Jae-min. I got a call from the police a few days later. They said Jae-min was hit by a train. The orphanage director identified him, held a small funeral, and cremated his remains. But how could he… Why did the police contact the orphanage, not you? The orphanage was registered as his residence, and he left his cell phone too. ORPHANAGE And this. A man named Lee Dae-hyun sent him strange texts. He claims other orphans from the orphanage died from strange causes, so he was warning Jae-min to be careful. Have you shown this to the police? Yes. But they said it wasn't enough to open an investigation. I'm sorry that I have to bring this up. We specialize in murders, so you came to the right place, but the cost of investigating a murder isn't cheap… Is 50 million won enough? This is Jae-min's money anyway. He saved up so we could move to a good house for the baby. I see, here. Did he ever suffer from insomnia or depression? Nothing like that. Could you fill this out? Thank you. RETAINER AGREEMENT Just the social security number and contact info. Yes, right there. Ms. Seo, your worries will be over now that we're on the case. No, this is a murder case! We finally got a case that fits us. Hey, buddy! How do you know it wasn't an accident? A man with someone to rely on will not kill himself, no matter how hard life is. Detective Kim Jeon-il said something like that. It's clear-cut to me. The police think he got in an accident while running away. From my experience, that's highly likely. Who runs away while buying fruit? Haven't you ever wanted to run away while throwing out garbage? I know you have. Sure. Is that so? So it's an accident? Come on… Why are you in such a foul mood? Is this because of the 70-30 split? Okay, since it's our first case, let's split it 50-50. Let's go! Let's go! Where? Let's think about this, where would Sherlock go? Stop it, asshole. DETECTIVE AGENCY SEONG-BUK POLICE STATION, RAILROAD HEE-YEON AND JAE-MIN'S HOME Kim Jae-min went to buy fruits for his pregnant fiancée. - So why was he at a railroad? - I told the cops everything! What happened during that time? Kim Jae-min wasn't recorded on any of the security cams between the fruit shop and the train tracks. So he either went around to avoid the cameras, or moved around in a car. Then was he alone? Or did someone pick him up? Train's coming! She was so clingy, so I looked into it. The train conductor said he was alone. Plus, we found his ID card and the director of the orphanage identified him. Did you look into Lee Dae-hyun? A man named Lee Dae-hyun sent him strange texts. Cheol-ho's hit-and-run case seems strange, and Jae-hee would never kill herself. Jae-min, you could be in danger too! Be careful! They grew up in the orphanage together. But it was a burner phone, and it was always off. But you can track his location. How can we do that when there is no case? Sir, are you really not coming back? Stop saying nonsense, and get me his location data by tomorrow. The new captain is super anal about rules… Using cloned phones is illegal, though. And what if someone really was after Kim? The deaths of his friends could be related to this! You should've located and interrogated Lee Dae-hyun! That's what a cop is supposed to do! - Did you learn nothing so far? - Okay, I get it. There's a parents' meeting today. And the twins can't eat raw fish. Damn it! What's with the expensive fish? Is this for bringing in a case? Well, it seemed like you like raw fish. Let's drink. It's so fresh. You must've saved up quite a bit. Money's tight. Things will work out. I'll get my severance soon… You haven't gotten it yet? But you resigned a long time ago. Well… You know… Come to think of it, Detective Song was asking when you were coming back. - But you resigned. - Right… Wait, you didn't? Then leave of absence? Yes. So you were just testing things out? That's not it... You accused me of lacking any sense of reality, but yours is off the charts! Will you just listen to me? I don't need to listen to anything! You were just testing the water, and now that we have a case, you're going all-in! No wonder! The food was getting caught in my throat. I'm all business with you now. No friendship, no clingy stuff. Clingy stuff? You prick. Have plenty of fish. I'm gonna go. See you tomorrow, Mr. Noh. "Mr. Noh"? You jerk! Dae-man! What's the likelihood of this case being a simple accident? Mr. Kang, consider it an accident. There's no evidence to prove otherwise. Detective Song can't get us Lee Dae-hyun's location data. You must've treated him badly in the old days. You should ask Yeong-cheol. I still have some pride left, you know. You should ask him yourself. I'm driving. You should ask him. You can always stop the car. Detective Song! Come here, asshole. Is this how I taught you? I'm sorry. I had no choice. You jerk. Do you have a death wish? Killing an officer is punishable by at least 30 years in jail. Will that be okay, Mr. Noh Tae-su? Are you the new captain? How do you know me? I see your face several times a day. You're volunteering your time to help those who were shunned by the police. You're not wearing a visitor's pass. A visitor's pass? Attention! Gather around. Don't you know all guests are supposed to wear a visitor's pass? Do you have the right to catch criminals when you're not even following a simple rule? An off-duty cop is posting sticker ads here like some peddler. Aren't you ashamed? Don't you even have pride as detectives? How will you earn the trust and respect of the citizens? The captain speaks the truth. Follow his orders properly. You brat! What a guy for someone so young. Remove all the stickers from the bathrooms! Your face smells like piss! Why's he taking it out on me? He couldn't even say anything in there. Wait for me, Mr. Noh! HYUNGJAE ORPHANAGE This facility is better than my home. Look, everyone's eating different dishes. There are so many famous sponsors. That's the ballplayer Gu Ho-cheol. He passed out during a game and was out for a season. Hospital, training center, orphanage, food factory… This foundation is huge… The director must be resourceful. Sorry for making you wait. Had I known he had a fiancée, I'd have contacted her. I feel so sorry. His body was badly damaged from colliding with a train. How did you identify him? I'm a director here, but I used to be a doctor. I treated the orphans myself. Take a look. I stitched Jae-min up when he was seven, when he fell from a tree. I identified him with this scar. Dad. Oh, I haven't offered anything for our guests. I easily forget stuff at my age. Thank you, Sa-hee. Is she your daughter? She was an orphan of this facility. Thankfully, she grew up so well. She's busy with her own work, but she comes by to help out. Is Lee Jae-hee also from here? The one who committed suicide. Yes, that's correct. And the hit-and-run victim Oh Cheol-ho? You looked into many unfortunate incidents. They were lonely kids, so many of them have a hard time adapting to society and often get entangled in such incidents. Despite my best efforts, it's not easy. Do you suspect him? You're suspicious of everyone. Right? He's just too perfect. If this was a movie, he'd be a super villain. Do you catch criminals based on their looks? What would he gain from this? Gain? I don't know. - Mr. Noh… - Stop that crap! Lee Dae-hyun warned Kim Jae-min. We must find Lee Dae-hyun first. Where are we going? What is this place? Where are we? Hey, Chi-hyeong! Maybe he saw us coming and took off. No, it looks like he just poured this. So much stuff. Oh, my gosh! Darn it. Mr. Noh, welcome. I thought it was a body. Why was he in there? I was going to get some rest, but I fell asleep. Detective Yeo. Looks like you're still into illegal stuff. You've set up an impressive shop. What do you mean? I'm a model citizen. What does he do? He was the best Cyber Crimes Unit agent, but he had Othello syndrome. He got caught wiretapping his wife, home, and car and served time in jail. Come on, sir! He might think it's real. I even visited you in jail. So you're asking me to track a phone? Yes. Sir, but that's illegal. I know. I'm clean now. Okay, why don't we give you a cut of this case? - Five percent… - Ten… Ten percent. Deal. He's so handsome and very business-orientated! - How much was the fee? - Thirty million. - How about 15 percent? - Dae-man. Just report him to the Cyber Crimes Unit for cloning and wiretapping phones. Alright. Since you're in a hurry… What's that? - "What's up, baby?" - What are you doing? I'm trying to sync two phones and remotely control it so I can turn the GPS on and off at will. I have to install a hacking program on the target phone. Like a phishing scam. Sending URLs don't work nowadays. "Baby, are you seeing another girl? We just broke up." Please give me a call. I'm at the Han river right now. "If you don't come, I'll jump and die!" Do you want to die? This works 100 percent! A cell phone, and this. Anyone with this combo can be baited. By tomorrow, this phone will be synced with his. You little brat. Daddy's home. I'm home. Okay, I'm going. READING WITH MOM MOM MADE SPICY RICE CAKE TODAY Spicy rice cakes… You were so confident. You said it'd be done by today! Mr. Yeo. I thought I'd be seeing a genius hacker in action. A genius hacker? No way. Dae-man, he's actually two years younger than you. I thought you were older since you're so tall! You should've told me. Does this guy really have balls? Did you check? Let's just forget our deal. Why are you guys so impatient? What? He took the bait! - He did? - He totally did! Look. I told you so. How will you achieve anything with such little patience? Patience! But why are… Patience! There's a limit to my patience. - Okay. - Hurry up! "Remember my last moments." Now, when he plays the video… When he plays it, a hacking program will be installed… Lee Dae-hyun's phone has been cloned. Good job, kiddo! - Let's go, good work. - Coming. What about my cut? After the case is closed. Those assholes… Did you learn to drive at a senior home? We'll never catch him! Can't you see the traffic? This isn't an airplane! But he's moving just fine! Left turn! Come on! Turn left! Straight! Go straight! Hurry, let's move! You jerk! Are you nuts? Drive properly! - Do you drive with your eyes closed? - He's so harsh. Why don't you drive, then? What? He stopped. Where is this? Is it here? Give me that. His resident registration got canceled. He can't have a job. If he can move freely in and out of a traffic jam… A motorcycle? Hey! Mr. Lee Dae-hyun! Lee Dae-hyun! Lee Dae-hyun? What's going on? Lee Dae-hyun! Lee Dae-hyun! - Hey! - One moment, please! - What are you doing? - Let him go! - Let him go. - What are you doing? My motorcycle! Give me a call here. Lee Dae-hyun! Stop! I want to ask you something! Don't follow me! Lee Dae-hyun! Watch out! Lee Dae-hyun! Hey! Move! Stop! I need to ask you something! It's me, Dae-man! You scared me! Be quiet. We'll get caught! Go! That's weird… What is? - It's flat. - What? It's two-dimensional. We're at the right location, but he's not here. He's up there. The same spot but above us. Let's go up. Don't touch me! I'll go up there. You check this level. Me? Why? Are you scared? What do you take me for? Are you going to beat him to death? Just in case. - Be careful. - Okay. Here we go. Get going! Darn it… What's this? Stop it! Stop, Lee Dae-hyun! Let's just talk! Please stop! Lee Dae-hyun! Stop right there! Stop running away! Lee Dae-hyun! Hey, listen! Don't move. Just one question. Kim Jae-min… Who killed him? Who killed Kim Jae-min? Hey, stop. Hey! Take my hand! Jae-min… The Venom! - Lee Dae-hyun! - Tae-su! I got you! You're lucky they had security cams because of the factory ownership dispute. You could've been arrested as a suspect. I told you it was an accident. Lee Jae-hyun had no resident registration. How did you track him in a day? Captain Kwon, that's not important right now. Kim Jae-min's case needs to be reopened. There's a high probability that it wasn't an accident. So? Is there a suspect? We're working on that… Did you find any evidence that it wasn't an accident? Well… Not yet… But Lee Dae-hyun knows something, so when he wakes up… When he wakes up, we'll interrogate him, and if we find him suspicious, we'll open an investigation. Thanks, Captain Kwon. Officially. So from here on, do not get involved in this case. And you two, if you help him without my consent, you're finished. So act wisely. Did you get Lee Dae-hyun's current address? No? He was on the run when he got into an accident! The thing is… Are you guys serious? I don't want to make it difficult for you guys, but… And check the security cams for any vehicles that headed to the site… Well… You punks! - Dae-man, let's go. - Okay. ANTI-STREET URINATION PLAN Is this Traffic Services? I'd like to check some security footages. Sir! This is Detective Song Jae-pil from the Seongbuk Station Violent Crimes Unit. MI-OK Listen to this. What? Do you have a guilty conscience? I heard you reported Jae-hee's suicide. Why were you at her place, Mr. Kim? It's none of your business. Just be careful. You could get bitten by the Venom. The Venom? Lee Dae-hyun mentioned the Venom before falling. Mr. Kim Jung-hwan? Who is he? Well, we can't just wait until he wakes up. Let's go check out his place. We don't know where he lives! Home! Right here. Starting navigation guide. Yes? I'm at the ICU at Sesarang Hospital. Come here right now. What for? I need you to keep an eye on an important witness. I'm really busy. Just get over here! Give it to me. Mr. Yeo? It's Dae-man. We're investigating a murder and the killer is a super villain! Even his name is awesome. It's the Venom! He sounds so scary! That's why we can't trust anyone else. I was so moved when I saw you working! I didn't know Korea had a genius hacker like you! So, Mr. Yeo. I mean, Yeo Chi-hyeong! Help us out. Only you can do this! Where should I go? Arriving at destination. Gosh, we got caught. How did he find out? Kang Dae-man, you bastard. - Hey. - Evening. You got a call from your wife. You had my phone? Seriously? I've been looking for it all day! Come on! - Evening, sir. - Hey. - I unlocked it for you. - Okay. Thanks. Hey, honey. No, how could I forget our wedding anniversary? He's clueless. It's Children's Day. How could I forget? I guess he only slept here. I already checked everything. What? What's all this? SESARANG HOSPITAL THE VENOM SLEEPING PILLS? NO WILL MR. KIM? Oh Cheol-ho, Lee Jae-hee, Kim Jae-min… All from the same orphanage. A suicide, a hit-and-run, and now a train crash. It definitely smells fishy when looking at it like this. You realized that now? Stop being pompous and keep going. What they have in common is that they all died after leaving Hana Food Corporation. The man who discovered Lee's body was the guardian of the hit-and-run victim. And he threatened Lee Dae-hyun, too? Right. This Mr. Kim is linked to all cases. Mr. Kim Jung-hwan? Oh Cheol-ho's guardian. Lee Jae-hee's witness. Then what about Kim Jae-min? They're all connected to Choi Seung-bok too. This name's new. Who is he? The Venom, perhaps? Mr. Kim told Lee Dae-hyun to watch out for the Venom. My high school teacher was also called the Venom… The Venom's bite really hurts… It hurt so much. Of course it did… I'm sorry! It's all my fault! At least you know. Where were you last night? What the hell were you doing on our anniversary? Stop overreacting! Thanks for marrying me. I don't mind cheap stuff. How could I ever wear this outside? Just wear it as much as you want! I'll buy you something better next time. Thanks, baby. Let me help. - Where? - Back here. You're the best! What? Who's this? You haven't forgotten me, right? Hello, ladies. Have some coffee. You're the best! - Dr. Kim's not here? - No. - When's your day off? - This week, I… Excuse me for one moment. Former Cyber Crimes Unit, Private Detective Yeo Chi-hyeong. Chi-hyeong, what's going on there? What happened? I called so many times. I'm sorry, we were busy investigating. Nothing happened last night. How much longer must I do this? I'm tired. Aren't you used to stakeouts? I was tied to a desk. I never went on a stakeout. There! That's our suspect! Go get him! What? Where? Hey! - He's a headache. - Hey! Does Kim Jung-hwan work here? Yes, he's head of General Affairs. Is he here today? No, he'll be back soon. By the way, if those weren't accidents, then… The Venom. What? Do you know the Venom? I do. Venom, like poison. Could we meet Choi Seung-bok? - Seung-bok? - Yes. What for? We have some questions for him. - One moment. - Okay. Choi Seung-bok! Did I do good? Great, I'm so proud. But I'll ask the questions. Why? I have plenty of questions too. Interrogation isn't about asking random questions. It requires a very specific set of skills. I'll ask the questions, so sit back and watch, okay? Sure. Do you know Jae-min? I like him, but he's dead… Why did you have to make him cry? Don't cry. Here, take this. Mr. Kim! You were asking for me? Dae-hyun had a severe delusional disorder. But even so, a murder? I heard you discovered Lee Jae-hee's body. Yes. Why were you at her home? She was having a hard time after she left, so I wanted to talk to her after work. So you keep taps on them after they leave here? They have nowhere to turn to. I try to support them to the best of my abilities. When they start out, I set up their bank accounts. I manage them too, since no one really saves up. Sorry, but I have other plans. Certainly. Thank you for your help. One second. She committed suicide by leaving her stove on. How did you get inside? I was with her when she signed the lease, so I knew the code. What's the code? I don't remember now. When Kim Jae-min was killed, where were you that night? I heard the news at our training center in Pocheon. - Could I take some? - Sure. - Thank you. - Bye. He's lying. He knew the code of a grown woman's home? And how did he know she was dead inside or not? Your deductive reasoning is impressive. I taught you well. This could mean that he also lied about other things. I'll dig in further and prove his connection to the cases. Just like how you keep lying to your wife about the comic shop. You're on a hot streak. Confirm your suspicion. Catch the killer too. We're really not compatible… Let's go catch him. YOU MUST BE TIRED. HAVE THIS. I'm just too popular. Where's Lee Jae-hee's home? - Room 401. - Here? The 4th floor? It's all cleaned up. GAS POISONING SUICIDE? SEPTEMBER 22 Killing herself when she was planning to go on a trip in three days? HIRED AT TERMINAL CLUB, NOVEMBER 28 Was there anything different on the night he was killed? Cheol-ho left early to meet someone. Mr. Kim? Kim Jung-hwan? No, it was a nickname. What was it? Poison? - Venom? - Yes, that's it. Yes? What? - What's going on? - You can't go in there! This is a restricted area. Come during visitation time. - Let me in! - You can't do that. I was keeping my eye on the door… But suddenly doctors were rushing inside… They said he's dead… It wasn't your fault. It was an accident! The security cam captured you trying to save him, right? You might not know, but he killed a lot of people. The Fire Moth was hit by a car while being chased by him - and died… - Yes. You know about the murder swap case, right? - You shot that person, didn't you? - Yes… Bang! And he was fighting this gang on a rooftop and they all fell to their deaths! Imagine the trauma. Mental scars don't heal that easily, right? Give me your hand. Another poor soul died during this case. With this hand, an agent of death! One could argue that. I understand you wholeheartedly. My home is so full of love I hear you. Let's have another drink at my place. That's impossible. Your wife will kill you. My wife will prepare a feast for us. You live in Apartment 105, right? Yes, here. Wait a minute… - Dae-man. - Yes? To be honest, I'm an outcast at home. What did you say? I'm an outcast. My family hates me. I'm trying so hard, but nothing works… Don't cry. - Stop it, come on. - I just want… - Tae-su! Honey! - I'm living for my family… - Honey? - What are you doing? Good evening, ma'am. Go home, Dae-man. - I'm home, baby. - Dae-man! - Yes? - It's this way. - Take care! - Okay, bye. - Dae-man! - Yes? Good morning. Let's get hangover soup. Tae-su. Hang in there. Sure… I asked Detective Cho for Oh Cheol-ho's address, but it wasn't the factory dormitory. Then how did Mr. Kim hear about the hit-and-run accident? He has multiple fractures. - Who's the guardian? - I am. Mr. Kim arrived even before the cops and claimed that he was the guardian. So he knew about it beforehand? Right. Also, they said Lee Jae-hee took sleeping pills and left the gas on, but she never got a prescription. These pills found by her body can't be obtained without a prescription. Someone snuck in, put her to sleep, left the pills there, turned the gas on, and made it look like a suicide. Who? Mr. Kim is highly likely. Maybe he had an accomplice. If there was one, he would've opened the door for him, and Mr. Kim would've called 911 and brought her to the hospital. If we figure out where the pills came from, we could find the evidence. Yes. Oh Cheol-ho went to see the Venom and got in that accident. I think Mr. Kim used the Venom to lure Oh Cheol-ho there. Hey. Either Mr. Kim did it himself, or his accomplice did so. Cheol-ho! Over here. Let's move. Either way, Mr. Kim is somehow involved in this case. Then why pretend to be Oh Cheol-ho's guardian at the hospital? To eliminate suspicion? Choi Seung-bok… Choi Seung-bok is the one who bothers me. Lee Dae-hyun must've wrote his name for a reason. Dae-man. There's a certain feeling about each murder case. What do you mean? As if it's been planned out for a long period of time, this case feels emotionless. What do you mean by that? If you were to kill your father for the inheritance, what would you do? I'd create a bulletproof alibi, and try to make it look like an accident. Think about it. For your example to pan out, there must not be any evidence that shows emotion. So even if your motive was exposed, it'd be hard to prove it if there's no proof that leads to you. So we should look for a motive rather than evidence? To look for the motive, one must think about that feeling… Common motives are concealment, blind passion, grudge, and money. Money is the only thing that lacks any emotion. Is 50 million won enough? Our client had the severance, so that's not it. Before he resigned, Mr. Kim managed everyone's accounts. I manage them too, since no one really saves up. I got it! What if Lee Jae-hee and Oh Cheol-ho had life insurance plans? With Choi Seung-bok as the beneficiary. Mr. Kim manages his account too. All three of them had an accident insurance, and a special death clause was added before they left. Who's the beneficiary? - Choi Seung-bok. - Yes! Captain Kwon. Kim Jung-hwan had a clear motive. It's money. I'll receive another award soon. - Has anyone gotten it two years in a row? - Shut up! You have to arrest him. We must first check any withdrawals… I already checked with the bank. A large amount was deposited into his wife's bank account around that time. This is the transaction record. Do me this favor, Captain Kwon. The bankbooks. Will you continue to be silent? Even if it was under Mr. Kim's jurisdiction, the insurance premium went up significantly. How could you not know? We have a lot of money going back and forth, and the premium payments keep changing… I left the whole factory business to Mr. Kim and the plant manager, so I didn't know anything. Did Mr. Kim really do this? He's keeping silent, but we have evidence. He'll confess soon. You fool… Why did you do that? If things were that tough, you should've told me. Don't worry about anything. I'll take care of your wife. So don't commit any more sins. Tell them everything and ask for forgiveness. Detective Noh! Hurry! - What? - What is it? I killed them all. My wife was sick. I needed the money. I climbed the pipes to her house, put her to sleep, and left the gas on. Where did you get the sleeping pills? I stole it from my wife's hospital. Who's the Venom? I am. Of course, I knew it was just a fake character. I waited every night. I picked him up in front of the fruit store that night. Which car did you use? A factory van… - Welcome, sir. - Captain Kwon. Detective Noh. You helped solve this case. You truly are the White Shark. It's all thanks to you, Captain Kwon. Send him to the prosecution. I'm meeting the chief. Yes, sir. Thank you. Take care, sir. Aren't you jealous, though? He didn't do anything. They're getting all the credit. We earned 50 million, though. Hey, you should be happy. What's with the sour face? This doesn't seem like a one-man job. Gun-woo, Hong-ji! Mi-ok! The man of the house is back! Honey! Baby? You sold the comic shop? Baby! Don't do this for the sake of our kids! It's a gun! Nice! You've got brass balls! How could you do that without a second thought? No! I thought really hard and came to that decision! Gwang-gyu must've made so much fun of me. He's not like that! He's a good guy! I've had it! Here! Sign this! I'm going to the court first thing in the morning! Damn it! Mi-ok! Please! I'm so sorry! I'll never do it again! - Dad? - Yes? Bang! Mi-ok… Go wash up. Can you do that? What's this I smell? What's going on? I… Eat up. Thank you for the food, mom! Your dad made it. Thank him. He did? Wow… Yes, dig in. Honey… I solved the case that I mentioned. Is that so? That's good. Hee-yeon, you dropped this. Thank you. Jae-min loved to donate blood. BLOOD DONOR CARD Since his blood was so rare, he was popular at the clinic. - I don't know if we should accept... - Thank you. He'll be able to rest in peace thanks to you. Please keep helping other victims. Of course. What a pity. Worry about your own life. You might get divorced. You look really good. Did you wiretap us? I need to get paid, you know. I bet he'll go to jail again. Right. I love you. Please request my service again. I want to smack him. Should I report him to the Cyber Crimes Unit? Are you getting ready for a divorce again? Why can't she understand us? I've made a hard decision for my family. But why decide it on your own? The most important thing in a marriage is conversation. Are you giving me marriage advice? Should I give you divorce advice? The culprit who killed his employees for insurance money was caught. That's our case. The victims were orphans… They're acting like they did all the work. KILLED EMPLOYEES FOR INSURANCE MONEY Detective Song! Have you checked the security cams I mentioned? What? Damn it! Come out! That house is on the 4th floor. He can't climb that high with a prosthetic hand. The factory van that Mr. Kim said he used to pick up Kim Jae-min was never seen near the crime scene. How could you not check this? I'm sorry. I had the data, but we got the confession, so I didn't check. But I did find the suspect's car. Here. It was headed to the crime scene and appeared after 30 minutes. It's a non-registered car. Here, you see? - It's 64N… - Okay, 64N… You guys are so old-fashioned. Just take a picture. Snap! SARANG TRAINING CENTER April 27? FOUNDATION MEETING Here! Foundation executives stayed here for a meeting or something. The director and the hospital head. The director? Are you sure? Yes, I wrote it down. I was so busy that day. I can't even get off work when they come by. They nag so much too. Did you see him? Oh, him! He was here that day? Yes, he left the next day. He had it tough, serving the director. What he said to us when we first met was true. Someone else kidnapped and murdered Kim Jae-min. MEDICAL RECORDS The guardian, Kim Jung-hwan… This patient was moved to a different hospital yesterday. - Where? - Sesarang Hospital. She barely had any money to pay our bills… So he made a deal for the sake of his wife. I'm sure now. Director Woo is the one. We don't have any evidence, though. I told you he seemed like the culprit when we first met him! I had a gut feeling about him, but you didn't listen! Why bother investigating if you're going to follow your gut? Just say, "You look like the culprit," and toss them in jail! Don't get angry. We can just talk calmly. I was only saying that we should stay on our toes since he seems like the culprit. Mi-ok! You're doing whatever you want, so I'm doing the same. So what do we say to him? The director didn't get any insurance money. We have to know his motive so we can question him. - That's what an interrogation is for! - "Interrogation"? It's just asking questions. He's not just going to say, "Yes, I did it." An interrogation is a game that uses the asymmetrical nature of information. Uses the what? Come again? What did he say? The asymmetrical nature of information! He doesn't know what we know, so we have to use that to extract information, and when we have him, we throw the bait! Tell me the truth. You have no plan, right? No plan! Don't do anything today. Just look after the baby. Let's do nothing. When I send you a signal, go outside and call me. Be quiet, Hong-ji! Don't bark at my baby… Peekaboo! Children are all angels. You can take all these, but his wallet has blood on it. You're a very kind soul. You solved the case, and brought these back too. You could say we're in the service business as well. We should wrap things up nicely since someone has died. By the way, where did you hear the news of Kim Jae-min's death? At the training center. There was a foundation meeting. Who did you go there with? The hospital director… Oh, and the office manager. No one else accompanied you? No one else. Hong-ji, we're almost done. Don't cry, baby. Why did you bring your baby to our workplace? Hurry up! Sorry about that. His wife ran away from home recently. It's quite alright. But wasn't this case wrapped up? Mr. Kim didn't kill Kim Jae-min. What? Pardon me for one moment. DAE-MAN Chi-hyeong, what's up? What? A non-registered car? Are you kidding me? You're telling me that now? The plate? 64N 6406? Okay, fine. You're better than a cop. Sorry about that. We got an important tip. - I see. - I should get going. - I'll take these. - Certainly. - I'll see you again. - Sure. And then we throw the bait! Wow, using the plate number like that? The White Shark's still got it! By the way, what's with Kim Jae-min's wallet? I wanted to check something. I'll let you know when the result comes out. You got something on your lips. Darn it… Hong-ji… This is what I think. This case has two motives. Two accomplices may have their own agendas, right? Director Woo's motive is different. He got Mr. Kim and someone else to commit these crimes. Since they'll kill the orphans anyway, Mr. Kim got them life insurance! Director Woo may not have known about those insurances. Sure, that… That makes sense. I'm sure there's something behind Sesarang Hospital. Look, it's mentioned several times in Lee Dae-hyun's notes. Then let's dig into Sesarang Hospital. Chi-hyeong! What about him? Since the case is not solved, we should give our money back. We should get his cut back too. Take my money back? You can't take it back! This could be the greatest unsolved mystery there ever was. That can't happen. We'd have to return the money. I spent all my money. Then we'll have to solve it. Okay, do that. We should sell this to pay the client back. Come on! Can you analyze the blood here? Nothing in-depth, I just need the blood type. Hong-ji, it's Mom. Gun-woo's academy class will be over soon. Pick him up. KANG GUN-WOO Gun-woo! Can I see guns at the station? Gun-woo! It's Dad! Dad! - What're you doing! Gun-woo, get off! - Dad! - Dad, help me! - No! Dad! - Dad! - Mi-ok! - Mi-ok! Honey! - Dad! Help! - Hold still! - Dad! Hong-ji! Damn it! - Dad! - Hey! Gun-woo, get off! Dad! Gun-woo! - Gun-woo! - Gun-woo! Gun-woo! Gun-woo! Gun-woo! Honey! Mi-ok! Honey, are you okay? Gun-woo, are you okay? What was that? What would've happened if I didn't get here? That asshole! How could I trust the kids with you? I'm sorry, Honey. I was going to come early! Gun-woo! My boy! You idiot! Look at that! Darn it! Gun-woo! Do you have these pills at this hospital? Yes, but why do you need sleeping pills? I can't sleep well lately. I keep thinking of someone… Have these ever been stolen? Never. I keep track of them thoroughly. Really? You're good at your job. I've always wanted to ride a motorcycle. Could you give me a ride? I don't have a motorcycle, nor a license. I have nothing. I can't figure out what she does around here. She's the hospital office manager, but she doesn't do anything. - She doesn't get fired? - She got in through connections. Like who? This foundation's chairman, Woo Won-il. - The orphanage director? - Yes! ZOLPIDEM 10MG Bingo. Chi-hyeong, that idiot. Detective Noh Tae-su! We met briefly at the orphanage. What brings you here? I have something to tell you, it's about the director… Director Woo? What about him? The Venom? What… Good to see you, boss! I never thought I'd ever come back in here. Wait… You're not here to bail me out? Noh Tae-su! Are you so desperate to ruin our reputation? How could you attempt rape at a police station? - Rape? - It's a misunderstanding. Dismiss him right away! Chief, I've been framed! He ordered me to do it! De facto power! Is this really safe? When it's locked, even I can't open it. Don't worry. Yes? The blood test you requested came out as type A. A? Are you sure? Not Rh-? I stitched Jae-min up when he was seven, when he fell from a tree. Director Woo identified Kim Jae-min. That's the ballplayer Gu Ho-cheol. He passed out during a game and was out for a season. He was rumored to be dead a few years ago after he passed out during a game. But he came back healthy and became an MVP too. That was the talk of the town. Right… This is it. I got it. Yes, very good. Are you nuts? Honey… Don't beat around the bush, and just say it. I want to be a real detective. I don't believe this. If I stay put, the bad guys will continue doing bad stuff! I have to go and arrest them. It won't get solved without you? No. I have to go. I promise you, I'll never put my family in harm's way again. How exactly? I… I have to arrest them. I told you that. You're catching the bad guys? The kidnapper too? Mi-ok, let me do this one last time. Unbelievable! - Fine! Go! Before I change my mind! - You're going, Dad? Thank you, Honey! Dad, take the gun. Thanks, son. Good luck, Dad! Mi-ok… I was going to tell you the other day, but that bag… I'll buy you the real thing when I earn lots of money! I'll buy you a really good bag! You jerk! Nice going. Forget about us. What did you find out? The Director's motive. His motive? What's that? Organs. He was after the kids' organs. Oh, my… There were some strange things about what Mr. Kim did. Disguising himself as the victim's guardian after a hit-and-run, and killing someone and pretending to find the body. Then he had both victims moved to Sesarang Hospital, and both became brain-dead. The orphanage managed the orphans' health perfectly. All the sponsors were either rich or powerful, and they were all partnered up with the orphans. Director Woo checked their statuses through regular meetings. When the kids were old enough to leave the orphanage, they were sent to an unprofitable factory. It may seem like an act of goodwill, but they were kept there until their organs were needed, and were laid off. So suspicion wouldn't fall on the factory or the foundation. These guys are brutal… Kim Jae-min's case didn't quite match this theory. He died right after the incident, and his funeral was held after two days. There was no time to harvest his organs. They needed his organs, but he had a fiancée. No one would've missed the orphans, so it was easy until now, but that became a complication. So Director Woo got the Venom to kidnap him. But the damage to his body would've prevented any harvesting. Right. The one who died from the accident wasn't Kim Jae-min. His blood type is AB Rh-. But the blood type from his wallet… Is type A! Holy cow. Dae-man, he may still be alive. - Yes. - Right. Flight TG656, arriving at 16:25. I saw the hospital manager's schedule. Everything was revolved around today. Today may be Kim Jae-min's surgery. Captain Kwon! Sir, we should move quickly. It'll take time to report it and get permission from the higher-ups. Solving the case is a priority, so consider this a prison break. We'll find out about this in two hours and come after you. The White Shark is escaping. Thank you, Captain Kwon. We'll see you later. Let's get ready. Aren't you coming? I'm really tired today, seriously. I'd like to think things through a bit. - Okay. Could you lock this up? - Wait! Stop! Hold on! One second! Wait for me! I'm sorry. This is so stressful. Since Kim Jae-min's death was faked, his surgery won't be at Sesarang. I'll head to the orphanage, so you two get to the airport and find the manager. BANGKOK - Anything? - Not yet. Driving a fancy car through the back door? Too bad you won't get to do your surgery today. How much do you make doing this? I could make you rich. Aren't private detectives loyal to money? I guess that's why you treated kids like that. All you think about is money. No one pays any attention to them anyway. They'll live like trash and waste their lives away in the real world. If they help good people live longer, then their lives are worth something. Don't you think? People like you are what we call trash. Get out, asshole! That's… I'm so nervous. Don't they kill people too? They do. Damn it… They're coming! Hide! Let's just go! My theory was correct. They're doing organ transplants. But where are they going? Damn it… Where's your motorcycle? Parked safely in the parking lot. I don't like parking tickets. - Please leave a message. - Damn it, his phone is off. If something happens to him, it's all your fault! There has to be a clue… Is there anything near the training center? April 27? Foundation executives stayed here for a meeting or something. The director and the hospital head. I heard the news at our training center in Pocheon. Captain Kwon! They can't get in touch with Detective Noh. - Stop! - Why? What is it? Turn the light off. The engine, too. Push! Get off. Push it up. Careful. Don't damage it. Okay, stop. Is this the right place? It's too dark! It's too quiet. - No one's here? - I don't think it's here. We should leave! I got visual! - Go left! - Be quiet! I don't see anything! The light's off. - This way! - Focus! Is that the best you can do? - There are stairs. - It's okay. Nothing's impossible for Nina. It's going to break! - This way! - Let me focus! Back up! I see some light! On my way! Stop! They're all there! Damn it… What's that? No! Nina, get out of there! - What's that? Go get it! - What's that? Oh, no. - Catch that! - Get it! Let go of me! That was Tae-su, right? It was him. Give it to me. Wait. Do you have a license? What are you going to do? I'll buy you a new one when we solve the case. This is 30 million won. What? I have 47 payments left… Tae-su's in there. Is this more important? - He's important… - So keep this with you. What's this? - This is important too… - I'll be back right away! Kim Jae-min is still alive, and an illegal organ transplant surgery is underway! You just have speculations and no evidence! Why're you so gung-ho like Noh Tae-su? The location isn't even verified! They're heading for Sarang Training Center. If Kang Dae-man's theory is correct, and if word gets out that the police didn't do anything, imagine what would happen. What if he's wrong? Will you take the fall? If you're so confident, do it! Everyone, move out. You heard him. I'll take the fall. Get going! - Hey! - Yes, sir! Wait! I have a kid… Please don't kill me… Don't kill me… Please… I'll start counting. One, two, three… My 30 million won! What's with the commotion? What's going on? Get him! Hurry! Get him! Get him! Tae-su! Tae-su! Tae-su! Tae-su! Chi-hyeong must've found the power. Is it this one? - What? What's happening? - What happened? Dae-man, go that way. Tae-su. We're splitting up? Let me apologize. Wait a minute… Hey! I'm so sorry! I really am! Tae-su, be careful! - What happened? - The power is cut. Put it down, Dae-man. - I can't see anything. How did you know? - I knew you'd be hiding. - I saw you too. - You little… Chi-hyeong, are you okay? - Tae-su, I was so scared! - Hey! What the… What is this place? Look. You asshole! He tried to kidnap my boy… Don't move. I'll shoot. I'm so scared! I'm shaking! He's going to smash our heads in with that hammer! Dae-man, lock the door. Director Woo, you've got nice equipment here. It's all over. You have nowhere to go. So stop this nonsense, and let's wrap it up here. Doctor Jang! Kill them. Now! If you're caught here, you'll die too. If you want to live, kill them. Can we leave here alive? What are they saying? - Cops are waiting outside! Police! - Stay silent. I got a call that they've just arrived. You'd better make a good decision. We just want Director Woo. You can be let off lightly. - So stay still… - What is he saying? Did someone arrive? Looks like my boys came first. - What should we do? - Open the door! Open it! Tae-su! Dae-man! I told you! Jerks like you are human trash! You asshole! Dae-man, are you okay? Get up! Get up! Come on! Dae-man! It's so cold here… Open your eyes. Open them! Please, open your eyes… Tae-su, what happened? What happened? - Dae-man! - Are you okay? You got here now? You punk… Hey! I'm doomed. Mi-ok will kill me! She told me not to get hurt! - You jerk! - Blood! Damn it! Over here! Detectives! Turn left! Are you okay? Go that way! Arrest them! Don't move! Freeze! Turn around! - Get down! - Stay still! We rounded everyone up! Yes, sir. That's correct. It was all thanks to my rapid judgment. I'll see you in the morning! Just relax. Be quiet! Get inside, asshole! Get inside! How is he? It was a clean penetration, so he'll be okay. You idiot… Tae-su. Did you cry because of me? I saw you cry. If you pretend to be dead again, I'll kill you for real. Why's he crying? I was so happy to have met you. I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! I heard it cost 30 million won. We should get him a good bicycle or something. Sir. Captain, thanks for the backup. Brave Citizen Award… Get him another award. An organized crime group exploited orphans to provide organs to the rich and powerful… Hello. - Good morning. - Hello. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. I thought I'd never see her again… It's all over now. Live a happy life with your baby. Please take this. This money was your retainer. We can't take it back. No. It's not our money to accept. Please, take it back. You have a baby on the way. Use it for the child. You're insane… - Thank you so much. - Thank you. Thank you again. I hope you live a happy life. Dae-man, they're leaving. Take care. What have you done? Did you just return it? We have to make a living too! What about my hospital bills? I'm injured… What do I tell Mi-ok? I got shot, damn it… Jesus Christ… But they're having a baby. What about me? I have two kids! Gun-woo! - Then do we just accept it? - Of course! - That money? - Yes! You're heartless! What's this? The reward for exposing the insurance scam. Why is it so thin? Count the zeros. Is it a gift card? Hundred, thousand, ten thousand… What? 200 million? We caught a life insurance scammer. You should've said so! You scared me! I've never seen such a thing. Hey. Don't tell Chi-hyeong about this. Of course, he got his three million. You just have to trust me! That's where I got shot… Stop it! Why my comic shop? It pains me to go there! I've been introduced by someone high up. It could be a big case. I doubt it. I'm not going! It's 100 million won! CLOSED DUE TO IMPORTANT SECRETIVE BUSINESS Sit down. Let's solve a case together. Certainly. WHERE ARE YOU, BEBE? - "Bebe"? - "Bebe"?
