(MultiCom jingle) (car horns honking) (whistle blowing) (upbeat salsa music) - [Voiceover] Today, one of every three New Yorkers is foreign born and 90,000 documented immigrants enter the city each year. It is the strengths of their hopes and aspirations that fuels the energy of today's New York City. New York City is actually five cities: Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island. So why not travel around the world in five burroughs? All any explorer needs is a subway token to cross the Atlantic, the Indian Ocean, the Caribbean Sea. Sample the local cuisine, purchase traditional crafts from a street vendor, remember, have fun. (speaking in foreign language) - [Woman] Oh, shut up! - [Man] Calm down. - [Woman] No, No. - [Man] Take a deep breath. Let it go. - [Woman] Come on, you were going to leave me in that club, all by myself, like-- - [Man] Stop, stop. Just stop. - [Woman] 5:00 in the morning. - [Man] Hey! - [Woman] Don't walk away from me. - [Man] Sylvie, I can't keep bailing you out. - [Sylvie] What? You just lent it to me yesterday. I'm gonna pay you back. - [Man] Why don't you go home? Just get some sleep. - [Sylvie] I'm not afraid to be alone. Taxi! I don't need you. I don't need anybody. Asshole! Wooster between Broome and Spring. Can you turn on the air? - [Driver] It's on. - Here. - [Driver] Don't like musk? - Yeah, caio! (speaking in foreign language) (chuckles) Fuck him. I don't need his help. - [Driver] Excuse me? - [Sylvie] Nothing. - [Driver] You are in the film business, huh? Movies? - No. Why, do I look like I am? - [Driver] Yes. - Are you? - [Driver] No. No, no, no, not me. My brother is. Vikram Raj. Big movie star in India. - [Sylvie] Really? - [Driver] Vikram Raj! You've heard of him, no? - [Sylvie] No. - [Driver] Millions of fans. Millions. (carnatic music) (singing in foreign language) - I just wanna see if it still runs. (carnatic music) (humming) - [Sylvie] Why are we stopping? - Um, Wooster, between Broome and Spring? - Oh. (mumbling) Oh sh, I can't find my money. Please, if you write down your address, I promise I'll mail it to you. - I don't know. - [Sylvie] No really, please, this is really not like me. Please. Staten Island, okay. Thank you, Vikram. - [Driver] No, Bipin, Bipin Raj. - [Sylvie] Bipin, thank you, Bipin. - [Bipin] Thank you. - [Slyvie] Goodnight. - [Bipin] Goodnight. - [Sylvie] Bum, bum. Fuck. (dog growling) Oh, hello. (groovy music) - [Voiceover] Welcome to CBS News Radio 88, Traffic and Weather Together. - [Voiceover] Steve, you wanna get under the air conditioners. Here's Neil Bush, Chopper 88. - [Voiceover] Good morning for us, it's clear now but it's gonna get hot. We'll check with Greg Allen at the CBS Weather Center. - [Voiceover] The WCBS guaranteed high for today night. (fan droning) (door creaking) (speaking in foreign language) (bed creaking) - When will he leave? I'd like to sleep in my own bed just one night - I told you. It is a great honor to have him as our guest. - He's not the Maharaja. (laughs) And I expect occasionally he'll do for himself. - He isn't accustomed to living this way. - [Vikram] Chandra, bring me a glass of water. - All night long, I'm gonna kill him. - Shh ... - (yawns) Let it run so that there's no lead in the tap. (groans) (fan drones) Now close the door. We must keep the cool air so I can sleep well. Ah ... (serene flute music) (train rattling) (train conductor drowned by train rattling) (door slams) (distant television echoes) (speaking in foreign language) - Fuck! I'm sick of your shit. You said you'd do the dishes. I worked until 5:30 this morning. Jesus Josif. I'm cleaning up after people all night, all fucking night! I'm sorry. - [Voiceover] For today is 97 degrees. That gives you some leeway there. That means it could go as high as 102. If you combine that with the high levels of humidity this afternoon, you're talking about a heat index of 110 degrees. That is dangerously hot for New York. (upbeat salsa music) - Shit! - Shh ... Do you have to make so much noise? - Gimme kiss. - Do you really have to go? - Well, I have to get to the office and my wife, you know, she-- - Do not mention her in my house. Don't. - Why, why? - No more kisses until you get me my dress. The pageant is tomorrow. I can't believe you still haven't gotten it yet. - We already talked about this. Don't worry baby. I told you, tonight. (knocking at door) - [Voiceover] Marisol? I'm going down to open up the bake shop. Make sure your father gets dressed. (window squeaking) - We'll party, tonight. (speaking in foreign language) (upbeat music) - Papa? - Don't tell anybody. Go to sleep. (speaking in foreign language) (alarm beeping) (moaning) (telephone ringing) - [Woman] Oh come on, baby, please. - It might be important. Hello? - Get your Romanian ass out of bed. Today is the day, compa. - Who's that? - [Man] It's Ramon. I'm up. - [Ramon] You got the money? - [Man] Now remember, no money until we see cigarettes, okay? - [Ramon] Why, what's the problem? - [Man] 'Cause that's the way import export works. - [Ramon] When are we gonna do this? Where's it at? - Okay, I gotta go. - [Ramon] We gotta hand shake on this to work. - [Man] All we gotta do is show up. Gonna be beautiful. - [Ramon] I'm trusting you, we got a lot on this. - [Man] Ramon, it's gonna be beautiful, you hear me? - It better be beautiful. See you at the store then, alright? (speaking in foreign language) (upbeat music) - What are you looking for? Matches? There's no money in there. We owe $400 for rent, $75 to Mrs. Silesquin, $25 to Constantine for plumbing. - Come on baby, I'll pay you back tonight. I promise. - Your promise just don't gamble. God, Josif. - It's not gambling. Not gambling, business. Import export. That's what I do now, you know that. What are you gonna complain about, Elena, when I buy us a house with air conditioning and a hot tub? - What happened to the air conditioning you promised me last month? That's what I thought. Big talk. Big talk. - Oh, I see. If I don't make money, I don't desire, right? Right? Forget it, you're not listening. I don't even know why I talk to you. - I don't? You don't! - No, you don't, you don't. - [Elena] You don't! (singing in foreign language) (mellow music) (jewelry box chimes) (mellow music) (jewelry box chimes) (mellow music) (door slamming) Josif. - [Josif] Get dressed up tonight. I'm gonna take you somewhere special. - [Elena] Don't get blood on your good suit!

Sylvie, Sylvie pick up the phone. You hear me, pick up the phone. (beeps) (keys jingling) (singing in foreign language) (doorbell ringing) Sylvie! Hey! I need my keys! (doorbell beeping) Sylvie! - [Woman] What? (banging at door) - Come on, I know you're in there. (laughs) Sylvie, I need my keys. Please open the door. (laughs) I know you hear me. - Oh, shit! - Shit. Listen, I'm not going to call a fucking locksmith, understand? (speaking in foreign language) (mellow music) - [Woman] You better not go fussing around with that china cabinet. - Just making some coffee. You want some? - So. Now the coffee's in the china cabinet? - Oh no, woman. Just checkin' to see if it's secure. You know them rob coaster last week? Them take everything. But this here cabinet secure. Strong. Go on to bed now. Everything's cool. Just let me sit in the car! - No! - Look, what good is all this cheap china? We never ate off it, but a Cadillac! - It's my granny's china and I want it back! - When hell freezes over! - Crazy man. (footsteps stomping) - Oh lord, it's hot! - [Man] Where's the glaze, Errol? - At the store, right there, sir. - Stop rubbin' our car man. You're gonna ruin the finish. - Heh, let him wash it. She won't let him drive it. - What you talk about? I drive this car. - When? You've never driven that car. - I drive it here, right? Right, right? - Come on, no! So long as you ... - Cadillac. - Back home, the man was happy with his scooter. He'll take that car and make him a miracle. - Brenda, I don't understand how you let him sell your china and buy that old stink car. - I let him? No. The man sneak. For us he say. I don't drive. Maggie, Granny trusted me with the family china. Only precious thing she ever owned, 40 years of cutting sugar cane. - Brenda, I know, I know. You don't have to tell me. - But I got the key. - Sinclair, where are you? Crazy man, move your backside from the car! Move it now, man! Move it! All I ask is you don't touch the car. Don't touch the car. When you get your own car, you can touch it like a big fat woman. - Eh, eh, eh, why your neck's showing man? Give yourself a ride. - No problem-- - Move the, move man! - Start facing that woman. Why you let her treat you like so, eh? They don't know about the five finger solution. Pop! - [Errol] Watch your mouth now, before I slap them big lips off your face. You never treat a woman so. - That's why she driving you, instead of you driving that car. - You watching that vehicle man? - Close, and you know why? I'm gonna embarrass you in front of your woman. - Let me go now, let me go now. Oh yeah! - Boys, boys, this car got us fight, okay now? - You crazy. - Yeah, crazy. Don't touch the car! - Please! - Rodney's cousin's friend looking for cars, eh? He's seen the Cadillac. He say it's a real good price. He give me his card. He tell me give it to you. Take. Do. Take. - Errol. Errol. Come with pass, having a party tonight. There's gonna be lots of women there, boy. Look. I promise myself I wouldn't miss this party. Why don't we go there in style. Style, man. - You're right. We drive. - Style. - I'll teach she a lesson. Brenda! - Hates it. - Oh, I better go. Big mess. I'll see you. - See you, girl. - Whoo! - Hey, baby. - How are we doin'? (cars honking) - Bye, Maggie. - Not like her, she trouble. - Go on, tell her. - I got something I wanna tell you. - Yes? - I'm goin' to the store. - What? - Me I drive it nowhere. Good wheels about this car. (food sizzling) - This heat is unbearable. It reminds me of when Far Cry from Sadaam, which I made for the great Ipram, premiered at the Cairo film festival. I was outside of the old Plaza Hotel, chatting with Al Pacino. Suddenly, we found ourselves besieged by an enormous crowd. Fortunately, the concierge appeared and shouted in Arabic, "Make way for the star!" I looked back, and saw poor Al Pacino struggling to maneuver through the impossible crowd. I pulled him through that surging crowd. It was many years ago, of course. He said, "Thank you, my friend, "Vikram Raj, "thank you." He said, "If there's anything I can do for you, "please do call me." - [Older Boy] Why don't you call him? - Bala. - Al Pacino is on location, he is filming. I've spoken to his secretary. Don't worry. Soon your uncle will return to the silver screen. - You've changed your mind? You don't want fried eggs? - My yolk has bled. - The yolk is loose, exactly as you like it. - If you see no difference, I'll have yours. - Where are you going? - [Bala] Outside. - [Chandra] Okay, take your brother. - I don't wanna go. I'm still, I, I'm sorry. - You need to ween that boy. - [Chandra] Don't slam the-- (door slams) (door squeaks) (video game melody) (electronic blasts) - [Little Boy] I wanna play with this, no. - [Voiceover] The North American bison relies on an acute sense of smell for detecting danger. Sight and hearing also play an important role. - Chandra, tea. - I asked you not to yell. The water's on. - [Voiceover] For one or more days during the dry season. - Put up the volume. - [Little Boy] Mommy says no. - Put up the volume. Remember, rule number one: Never let a woman tell you what to do. Put up the volume. Put it up! (screams) - Now what have you done to him? - I'm not getting what I need. - [Chandra] Then go to a hotel. I've been on my feet all week, (phone rings) caring for sick people. This is supposed to be my day off. (phone ringing) - [Voiceover] A kind of thick wet clay. - Stop it, son, stop it. (baby crying) - [Voiceover] On occasion bison will-- - Your tea. - [Voiceover] Roam into populated areas. While they are not particular. - [Girl On Right] What, excuse me, the new Miss Colita, Miss Marisol Hidalgo. Ah, please. - [Marisol] Goodbye Brooklyn Boulevard. Goodbye 147th Street. - [Girl On Right] Oh no, what, like who you tell us. - Don't you know my man with the fat cash, the real cash is settin' me up with this? He's hookin' me up. You know, I almost let him go when I found out he was married. - What do you mean he's married? - Well, come on, you know I like to eat out. Steak, lobster. I ain't even lookin' for love. - Marisol! Marisol, get in here! You're not Miss Colita yet! - Eh! - [Marisol] Miss Colita. - So, I'll do it for you later. Alright? It's really, really cute. It's small pussy. Tell Mama I said hi. - Yeah. (speaking in foreign language) (phone ringing) - [Marisol] Hey baby, what's up? - I can't talk long, I'm in the office. Can you hold on a sec? Suzy, can you have Mr. Hutton hold, please? The phones are ringing off the hook. - Just wanted to remind you about the dress. It's in Soho. - I know. I know, Soho. - Don't work tonight, okay? I love you, bye. - Is he married? Where's your father? (radio announcer speaking in foreign language) (melancholy music) (train rumbling) (singing in foreign language) - God, it's hot, it's supposed to be 100. (speaking in foreign language) - Fuckin' polyester is what. Come on, put it away. I don't wanna see it. - What's wrong, it's gold. - It's a small chain. Show it to Bowman. (knocking) - Let's see what you got, Iscovescu. - I want $75 on the Mets. - [Bowman] Are you crazy, the Mets? - Yeah, New York fuckin' Mets. - It's a big overlay. Eight and a half? Two and a half. - That watch is worth $500 dollars. - Yeah? Where'd you get it? It's too hot for bullshit, god you. I'll give you $50 on the Mets. - $50? Okay. Don't scratch it up. I'll be back for it. (siren blaring) (melancholy music) (comical melancholy music) (groans) (comical melancholy music) Shit! (bell rings) - Oh ho, ho! What have we here? And a minute early. These are very fresh pork chops. You're in for a treat. (speaking in foreign language) Don't worry, take it. - I can pay, and I will pay. Please, can you hold this for me? - No, no. Josif will drop it off on his way. No discussion. (speaking in foreign language) - She never has the money. She's a direct descendant of Stefan Cel Mare. - [Josif] Oh, Stefan Cel Mare. - [Both] Ooh! - No (speaking in foreign language) in this shop, (speaking in foreign language). (speaking in foreign language). Put this on the shelf in the meat locker. (speaking in foreign language) (knocking on door) - Aye, sir? Aye, sir? (groans) (coughs) If you keep the door closed, the rest of the house won't get cool. - This house needs a bigger air conditioner. - You have company. (upbeat music) - Bala, if you don't mind. Find Simon and play with him. (singing in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (music echoes in distance) - Glad to see you all. Welcome. (upbeat music) (laughing) (singing in foreign language) (doorbell rings) - [Vikram] Chandra? (upbeat music) (doorbell ringing) (speaking in foreign language) - [Voiceover] It's a scorching hot day in Queens, as right-hander Dave Malicki takes the-- - Yes, man I'm tellin' ya. I'm tellin' ya man, yes! - [Voiceover] Six game losing street. (car bass drowns out radio) Looking very solid indeed, a 3.14 ERA for the first half of this season. (slaps) (dominoes rattle) (car bass booms) (lock clicks) (car engine starting) (air conditioning fan blowing) ♫ You can dance like no other woman ♫ Here ♫ In this world ♫ You got rhythm in your heart ♫ And you got fire in your soul ♫ Our ancestors dance for rain ♫ While some dance to be free ♫ So woman you're the greatest dancer ♫ The world will ever see (banging) ♫ Woman dance (woman drowned out by radio) ♫ Let me dance, dance, dance - What? ♫ Black woman dance (woman drowned out by radio) - What? - Your lights are on. - [Voiceover] And a grapple to short could be a double play. The flip to second, Jordan goes-- (singing in foreign language) - [Voiceover] Play ends the inning. We've got one hit, no runs-- (banging) (singing in foreign language) - Is that the guy? - Guys! Our case is an embarrassment. - We got it, Mr. Krug. We got it. (door squeaks) (car honking in distance) - Hello, boys. We're give tonight. The cigarettes will be in the truck. Park across the mall at 5:00, Jersey plates, understand? Now Boris, asking to ask you to see the money. So we can do business with civilized people. - No. No money 'til we see cigarettes. That's the way it is. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. Tell Mr. Boris that we'll be there at 5:00, like we agreed, all business up. - No fuckups. Okay, fuckups? - What was that? I thought we were doin' business with Boris. - This whole thing makes me nervous. - Oh, come on, Ramon, stop. It's gonna be beautiful, okay? - [Ramon] Shit. (door squeaks and slams) (door squeaks) - [Josif] Stelu, my friend. - Josif. - How are you? (speaking in foreign language) - How are you. - I'm in a pinch, though. Listen, I hate to ask you, do you think I could have the money, my wife lent your wife yesterday? - Oh, Josif. We just borrow yesterday. It's my daughter's communion. - That's right. - Hey, have a drink, huh? - No. - Huh? - I'm okay, congratulations. - Okay, kiddo? - Yeah. - Huh? - Yeah. (speaking in foreign language) Okay. - Be good. - Fuck! - Ah ... (mellow music) I'm reminded of the time we were shooting ... - He fled India because he couldn't find a part. - You don't know that. - Has he looked in the mirror? Does he know how difficult it is here? - Mr. Al Pacino may call him. - He will? - [Vikram] For my contributions to the Indian Chandra? Scotch! - I'll get it. - [Vikram] Al Pacino. - [Ladies] Al Pacino? - [Vikram] We were waiting for a taxi cab, on a miserable afternoon. We found ourselves-- - Bipin, he is taking over our home. It's either him or me. I'll take the children and go to a motel or something. - Chandra, let's not fight this weekend. You were so delighted when he first came. - Yes, but I had no idea that he was going to treat us like his next champas. I bend backwards too, 'cause then all he does is, "Chandra!" He say "Chandra!" I don't have to take this nonsense. (cries) - [Vikram] Chandra? It seems we have finished the nuts. - There is nothing left to eat. The house is empty. You've eaten it clean. - Bipin, do you let her talk to you like this? - I'll go to the corner. - No! (speaking in foreign language) I'll go. I need some fresh air. (singing in foreign language) - Sorry, Vikram. This isn't like her. - [Little Boy] No. - Yes, hello. Yes, hello, this is Sylvie Otti. I am the designer who called the ... Yes. Yes, no I would like to speak with Mrs. Bruckham. Oh, no listen, I've left 20 messages. I've started ... Hello? Hello? (phone beeps) Listen, I don't appreciate you hanging up on me. And I don't like your tone of voice, you hear? Asshole. (sighs) (mellow music) Hello? (speaking in foreign language) (bubble wrap pops) (speaking in foreign language) - But her thighs are huge. Jello. What? Yeah, um, I better go. Yeah, bye. Don't start with me. I shouldn't even be here today. - Was that him? (door slams) (upbeat music) (hoarsely speaking in foreign language) - The two sides of a coin; both shine pretty, but only one side will bring you luck. (singing in foreign language) Wear this white string around your finger, for it bounds your desires. It's there as a reminder of what you truly desire. - [Voiceover] Now the 2-1 pitch on the way. Wild pitch into the dirt, bouncing away. Here come Jeffrey Sis-- - Why you so edgy? You got money on this game? Wait a minute. Oh, no. - What are you, my wife? - Tell me you don't got the money on this game. Oh, Christ, Jesus! The fucking Russians will kill us! They'll kill us! - [Josif] Russians, Russians, Russians. - We'll be dead! Dead mother fuckers! Dead, dead, dead, man! - [Josif] What's a matter? - [Ramon] Promise me! - Ramon, you look like an old man. Would you calm down? It's gonna be fine. Do you trust me? Do you trust me? - Tell me the truth. - Elena's pregnant. - [Ramon] What? - She's pregnant. - [Ramon] Really? - I found her pregnancy test kit in the freezer. (speaking in foreign language) (somber music) - Small taste of heaven. Ranch-style Tudor, 1.3 acre lot, central air, and fully automated sprinkler system. It's a nice house. - It's mine. It's gonna happen. - [Mr. Krug] Guys, we got customers. (door slams) (laughing) (phone busy signal beeping) (singing in foreign language) - Damn. - Chandra, how nice to see you. What'll it be today? - Cocktail nuts. - You look tired. - I've worked all week. On my feet most of the day. I was looking forward to a quiet weekend, but my home's full of people. - Having a party, didn't invite us? - [Chandra] I wasn't invited. - $8.25, dear. Are you okay? Chandra, please, take this. - Thank you. - [Clerk] And tell him I'm a big fan, of Far Cry from Sadaam. (birds chirping) (crying) (somber music) (cars honking) (laughing) - Don't touch the car! Go home! Don't make me come get you! (laughing) (chanting in foreign language) (funky music) - Ah ... Down, sweetie. Ow, you're hurting me. - Have I told you how much I love you? - Not since last month when you had me go down to your job to lie for you. - Ooo, well, I do. - That tickles. - Oh, are you up to something? - Why do I have to be up to something to tell my wife that I love her? - Hmm ... I know you. - I'm feeling romantic today. - Hmm ... - When I come in and I see you lying there all sexy and thing. And I think to myself, "Good god you have a sexy woman." And lets the boys have a kiss. - Yes. (moaning) - Are you goin' someplace tonight? - No, why? - Sweets, there's a rooftop party downtown. - Go on. Yeah, that might be nice. - I know. Me and the boys, wanna drive. - Boys? - Where you goin' woman? - Get off me, man. - But, don't do it. - You talk all sweet to me, and me take that and get all wet between the legs, and now! - Don't raise your voice. - I will! - The neighbors will hear. - [Brenda] My mother say, "Be careful of that one. "He's liable to go soft in the head." - Who you callin'? Woman, give me that phone! Give me that phone! (busy signal beeps) Give me that! - You want the phone? You better run! You better run, man! You better run! - [Errol] Watch one day, one day that woman, she gonna have kids. (all kids talking and laughing) - [Voiceover] I'm telling you. You have to feel for this Mets squad. They're in the middle of a losing streak, and just can't seem to win for losing these days. It seems the heart has just gone right out of them. - [Mr. Krug] Hey, Romo? (speaking in foreign language) Come on. - [Voiceover] And he no chance in the world. Alright, that's the fourth walk of the game by Dave Malicki. Struggling a little bit with his control as we can see. Now the Phillies have runners to corners, with no men down, and up comes Greg Jeffries. We'll recall he used to be a Met some time back, a rather contentious stay at the New York team. The pinch to Greg Jeffries, a slider low and away. One ball-- - Two dollars. - [Voiceover] the count to Mr. Jeffries. Usually falls behind on Jeffries, two balls one strike. Jeffries waiting on the 2-0 pitch. - [Mr. Krug] Hotter than hell today. You can fry an egg on the sidewalk. - [Voiceover] And it's in the dirt, bouncing away. Here comes Jordan to score, and he does. And on a wild pitch, the Phillies go up five nothing. Nationwide, the conversation's of the deadliest death heat. For all your insurance needs-- - Can you picture me that age, still working here? I'd kill myself. - All these years hacking pork. What's he got to show for it? - [Voiceover] Having thrown though several innings straight here on a hot and very humid Saturday afternoon. (melancholy music) - I hear what you're saying, sweetie, but understand my scheduling needs. I have to draw the line somewhere. (shouting in distance) Frank! I can't hear myself. What the hell is going on out there? - I'm only trying to get an appointment, Fernando. Get out of my way. Are you crazy? - I'll talk to later, bye bye, sweetie. - Frank! Let her go. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - What's going on here? - Mrs. Bruckham, I've been trying to get an appointment for a month, and I'm really-- - So you just barge in? I hope you won't be too upset if I call security. Do I know you? - Yes, we've met. - Oh my god, yes! Little Sylvie all grown up, oh! You look splendid! I should have recognized your temperament. How is your mom? Did you see her fantastic collection on your way in? Sit, sit! I apologize. If I had only known. Sylvie, oh Sylvie, you've got Frank all worked up. I'll probably have to give him the rest of the day off. Oh, is that your book, Sylvie? How adorable. A designer following in your mother's footsteps. Why didn't you mention a name? I would have seen you toot sweet. - Here I take the feminine on the inside, and then throw it with a masculine edge. - Do you know I was your mother's fitting model? A perfect size eight. - Instead on this other page, I make a more body conscious silhouette that can-- - It's a wretched business, fashion. My advice to you, sweetie: run! - No, please hang on to it. - No, no, you'll need it. It'll probably get lost in all this chaos. - Mrs. Bruckham, I really-- - [Frank] The lead from DK on one. - Yeah. Yeah, listen, sweetie, we've been all over that. Hold on. Sylvie, Yuki Shimamura will be in town until tomorrow. She's a buyer for one of the biggest department stores in Tokyo. She'll be an important contact for you. Take her to dinner tonight. Don't let her pay, sweetie. Frank will set it up on your way out. Bye bye darling. Kisses to mama. Uh huh. (mellow music) - [Chandra] What's the matter? - Nothing, it was just getting too hot inside. - So now he's thrown you out of your own home. - It's a beautiful day. - It's 100 degrees. I'm not going to stand for this. He hasn't set foot outside of this house! - Please don't do this. (party-goers chattering) (singing in foreign language) - Please out! I want you to leave, please. It's nothing personal. (record scratches) Out! (bottles breaking) - Poom! Poom, poom, poom, poom, poom, poom, poom. - [Voiceover] A fly ball deep to left. It's up there, it's on its way, gone! A homerun into the kiddie park. - What are you doing? - They're fuckin' losing. What are you doing? - It's a loan, I'll pay him back before he notices. - [Ramon] Are you crazy, no! You're gonna mess everything up! Are you crazy, man? No! - You wanna tell that to Boris. Do you? - Hey, what's goin' on here? What is it, half a day today? - Miss Patreski called, she says she needs another chop. - Put it in the meat locker with the other. And remember, Joe. Remember. Drop it off on your way home, huh?
