SHE PROBABLY ALREADY DECIDED, AND THAT'S WHY SHE PROBABLY BROUGHT HIM BACK UP HERE TO DUMP HIM ON ME. SHE WAS TALKING A LOT, YOU KNOW, BUT YOU CAN NEVER REALLY TELL WITH SARAH, YOU KNOW? TALKING A LOT ABOUT WHEN WE WERE KIDS AND... HOW CLOSE WE WERE AS SISTERS. AND HOW SHE LIKED GOING UP TO THE LAKE HOUSE ON THE HOLIDAYS. AND THEN WE SAID OUR GOODBYES, AND MADE A LITTLE PLAN TO SEE EACH OTHER IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS, AND I GAVE HER SOME MONEY FOR THE BILL... AND THE POLICE SHOWED US THE FOOTAGE AND IT WAS REALLY STRANGE, IT WAS LIKE SHE KNEW. SHE WAS STARING RIGHT AT THE CAMERA. IT WAS WEIRD. AND THEN THE GIRL SAID SHE JUST WENT OUT AND THAT WAS... THAT WAS IT. SHE DISAPPEARED. AND WILL WAS ALONE IN THAT APARTMENT FOR THREE WEEKS. [BABY CRYING] AT NIGHT HE CRIES OUT, SAYS "SARAH" OVER AND OVER AGAIN, BUT HE DON'T TALK TO ME, HE DON'T TALK TO NOBODY. HE WON'T GO OUTSIDE, SO I THINK HE'S PROBABLY EMBARRASSED OR ASHAMED OR SCARED. BUT I CAN'T DO IT NO MORE, JOEL. I CAN'T LOOK AFTER HIM. IT'S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY, IT'S YOURS. RIGHT? HE'S YOUR BOY. [BABY CRYING] [CLATTERING] [KNOCKING] HEY, HEY, DIDN'T YOU GET MY CALLS EARLIER? YEAH... [SCOFFS] I'M SORRY... I KNOW, I SHOULD HAVE CALLED. YEAH, OR LEFT A MESSAGE OR SOMETHING.

YOU DON'T HAVE A CELLPHONE, RIGHT? NO. 651-3828, THAT'S YOUR HOME? YEAH. OK, WELL, IT'S GOOD THAT YOU GOT WILL INTO US, UH, WITH HIS DIABETES THERE ARE COMPLICATIONS THAT CAN HAPPEN IF HE'S NOT MONITORED REGULARLY, IF HE MISSES HIS MEDICATION. A 10-YEAR-OLD BOY NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AFTER. UH, I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING, BUT ARE YOU TWO LIVING TOGETHER? -NO, WE'RE NOT. -BUT YOU LIVE IN JOHNSTOWN, CORRECT? I LIVE IN ASHFORD. OK. LOOK, WE'RE NOT HAPPY, JOEL, AND I HOPE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND, BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PRESSURES... PARENTS ARE PUT UNDER WHEN DEALING WITH A CHILD LIKE WILL, WITH HIS CONDITION... AND NATURALLY WE'RE CONCERNED THAT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO COPE WITH THAT, OK? SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE WILL PLACED IN A HOME CLOSER TO GLOVERSVILLE WITH A MORE STABLE FAMILY. BUT HE'S HIS SON. OUR CONCERNS ARE FOR WILL'S WELFARE RIGHT NOW. AND FROM WHAT WE KNOW, MY RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU, JOEL, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO WHAT'S RIGHT BY WILL, OK? BUT NOTHING CAN BE DONE WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT, BUT WE CAN TALK OVER THE PROCEDURE, AND LOOK AT A POTENTIAL PLACEMENT FOR FOSTER CARE HERE IN GLOVERSVILLE. HOW ABOUT I COME AROUND ON TUESDAY AND GO THROUGH THE DOCUMENTS AND WHAT YOU NEED TO SIGN? GET WILL SORTED QUICKLY. THAT SOUND OK? ALL RIGHT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? -ARE YOU OK WITH ALL OF THAT? -YEAH.
