Please wait a moment. The victim's name is Michiko Kusuda. 20 years old. It's as if she came to Tokyo to get killed. She came to get killed? But it's been six months since we last saw you! You could forget about it, no? Your wife cannot come back. Who killed Michiko? - The investigation is still ongoing. - Mr. Kusuda... Do you think she went to Tokyo alone, all by herself? What are your intentions? We didn't come here to conduct an investigation. Tomorrow, we'll go to Tokyo with him. We'll identify the body at the morgue. After that, our job is done. Let's go eat. Concerning Mr. Kusuda... he killed himself. Is murder excluded? - He left a letter. - So what?!!! Who the hell is this guy? Hey! Namerikawa! I wanna smoke, can I? Pisses me off. Everywhere is "No Smoking". Since when have you been on the side of the Chiefs? Even in the police, we're still salarymen. To survive, best not be too stubborn. Did you find Michiko's cellphone? Seems there wasn't one at the scene. Is that so... But if it gets found, it'll be hell of a story. The whole town would break down. Didn't we meet at the beach before? - At the beach? - Yes. Actually, it's been many years since I've been there. On that day... you were there, right? What day? Us Japanese, we eat rice all the time. I lived with you for 10 years, during which nothing good happened. You'd think only of work, and I was left all alone. That's why I cheated on you. It didn't matter who with. And then... I asked her: "This man, tell me... "who is it?" K.S.S. presents A Monkey Town Production A film by KOBAYASHI Masahiro with KAGAWA Teruyuki TANABE Seiichi OTSUKA Nene FLIC CHAPTER II She didn't want to answer. She told me: "That, I will not tell." But her lover must have been troubled too. A simple affair that became serious... What if, by getting divorced, she'd force him to marry her... But... I swear to you, your wife's lover... wasn't me. It wasn't me. Actually, when I think of it, I'm unsure if she really talked about divorce. Might have been a hallucination or a dream... Like you said, I don't have my act together. I can't sleep at night. If I fall asleep, I dream and wake up right away. Sometimes I don't know where I am. With my hallucinations, I see hostility in everyone. In you, too. Well, I'm going. - You're leaving? - Yes. In reality, you're doubting me all the time. Even over the disabled man. You wanted to know where I was. It seems you don't have any confidence in me whatsoever. You know, I hold a grudge against you. - Namerikawa... - To get back, call a taxi. Hey! Tomorrow, I'd like to invite you here with Saeki and the others. Okay? Why? For a goodbye party. This time, it's me who's inviting. A confrontation, isn't it? Alright. Since you want it, we'll all share our hallucinations. I'll ask Mr. Saeki. And also... There's something else? I'll be resigning. When I get home, I'll send in my notice. Do as you wish. Another one! The police... contacted me. Thanks for coming. That wasn't very nice of you, Mr. Murata. Why didn't you tell me right away? Namerikawa! Mr. Saeki... Like I told you over the phone, Mr. Murata knows everything. - Everything? - From beginning to end. We're screwed, you and I. This gun... belongs to Mr. Murata? You went to his room? Yeah, and right after, I even did a trial run. - Shall we be going? - At this hour? -Sure. - But... - It's alright. We'll have fun. - Mr. Saeki... - It's okay. It's close by. What is he doing? Mr. Saeki... He's digging your grave! No way! But it's true. You know, you shouldn't even be alive! First, you fuck your boss's wife. Then, with yakuza involvement, you cut her up. It does make for a terrible story! And to top it off, what do you do? Huh? What did I do? You killed that woman, right? Michiko Kusada. A lively 20 year-old student... You cut her into pieces. It's not true. Not true! It wasn't me. I didn't do anything! What do you mean? It's true that, according to your instructions, I wanted to bring her to a hotel in Shibuya. But she escaped. Maybe she had a presentiment. Anyway, I... You killed her. It ain't true. I didn't do it! So who killed her? It was him. The pervert. It's the work of that serial killer, who's been making the news for months now. In any case, at this point, it doesn't matter. Fact is: Michiko Kusada is dead. I'm impressed. You're really something. You even killed the owner of that bed & breakfast. Aren't you a little insane? I see... You want to blame everything on me. I almost puked! All that's left is for you to die. Idiot! Cheater! Damn cheater! You were my superior. I asked you for advice. Mr. Murata's wife wanted us to get married... I didn't know what to do. I came to you for guidance. And you told me there was one solution... So what? Huh? Go ahead, tell me. It's very simple. Very simple... you blackmailed me, by using this story. For the price of your silence, Michiko Kusada had to disappear. So, what really happened? Huh? You fell deeply asleep. I had a dream... A horrible dream. You cried... and screamed loudly. Hello? Namerikawa? You're still at the bar? Yeah. So, you're still alive? Of course, why? Nothing. Hello? Bye. I'm leaving. I'll call you a taxi... - There aren't many around here. - There should be one passing. You need to add 5,000 yen. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Hey! Wait a minute. What it is? It's you... Looking for me? Are you alright? A taxi... You were right... I should have asked you to call a taxi. Can you walk? Thank you. - It's nothing. - It's pretty here. You think so? You're into hunting? It was my father's. Your father's? He was a hunter? - No. It was his hobby. - I see. Thank you. I'm feeling much better. You should rest some more. Have you always lived in this town? No. I lived in Tokyo. Really? Things happened there and I had to come back here. And you? I'm from Tokyo. I don't know any other cities. My wife was also born in Tokyo. We met at a very young age. - You were childhood friends? - Yes. Despite that... she cheated on me. It's normal, after all. I only ever thought about my job. Still... To think that I've lost her... I regret so much that day... I should've come home earlier. I'd finished work and then drank until dawn. When I think about all this... I feel so miserable. Really miserable... Tonight, you should try to sleep peacefully. You're in need of sleep, Mr. Murata. Also, you drank too much. So, tonight, sleep peacefully. You're so kind. - The night is over... - Is Namerikawa here? I have no idea. Just go ahead and see. Hey! Namerikawa! Is that you, Namerikawa? No such luck. It's Oikawa... Saeki's assistant. What is it? Mr. Ikuo Namerikawa just died. Listen, he was killed with your gun. Tell me, where are you? Actually, the local police... think you might be that serial killer. We already have a warrant out to arrest you. So, to proceed calmly... Stop talking bullshit, asshole. Oh my! You seem angry! Where are you, the two of you? Get out, please. Go. Over there, in that wasteland, forever sleeps Namerikawa. It was you who killed him and buried him here. With this gun. It's your gun. C'mon, take it. Things have come full circle! Only, the gun isn't loaded. The moment you take it, this one will burst your brain... And the case will be closed. The yakuza who killed your wife had a sponsor. Michiko Kusada was also killed by Namerikawa. And the bed and breakfast owner too! - The bed and breakfast owner too? - During a trial run. And then, you killed Namerikawa... With that gun. And now you're going to kill me. What happens next? Mr. Saeki's going to kill you too? It's a possibility... Like this. You take a malicious pleasure in changing the story at will. - Sorry. Do excuse me. - So, now who's going to kill me? - In fact, you're the only one left. - There's still someone else. Guess who?! Since you borrowed my car, I had to take a taxi. We can't find any around here. - I know. I called one. - It's better this way. It's unbelievable, what's going on! You were that Mr Saeki's lover, and the queen Madame for the prostitutes? Moreover, a professional film director. You've seen it, right? At Kusada's, the shocking pornos. The camera frames are hidden, it's her work. It brings in a lot of money. In Tokyo, we sold tons of it. And... You used it to terrorize Michiko Kusada. But I have a question for you. You ordered Namerikawa... to kill Michiko Kusada. Why was that? You could still have used her. It wasn't necessary to kill her! There's a time limit on being useful. For Namerikawa, and for Michiko too. When we're no longer useful, we die? I have one last question. Aren't you done yet? Ken'ichi Kusuda, you killed him too? Amazing! You don't get it at all! Ken'ichi Kusuda is alive. For now... We'll see in six months... we'll discover his body in the lake. Of course, at the station, we'll classify it as suicide. Actually, what we call 'the truth', it exists in various ways. Although... there's only one fact left... just one. You see that lake over there? Swans come there every year. Michiko Kusada often brought her brother Ken'ichi here, to show him the swans. After the loss of his beloved sister, poor Ken'ichi... lost the will to live. For him, the only place where he could die was in that lake. It seems to me... that the moment has come, right? EPILOGUE Hello? Is that you, Mr. Murata? Namerikawa? What's wrong? You sound funny. You're alive?! Why this question? I just went to your room. It seems you didn't come back... So where are you? No way! You're still drinking, aren't you? Hello? I'm so glad... you're still alive. I'm totally losing it... I'm a real mess. I must have embarrassed you. What's happening to you, Mr. Murata? I'll stop drinking. I'll start today. I'm "forbidden to drink". What will you do about tonight's reunion? You're the one who wanted it. You invited Mr. Saeki for a goodbye party. I warned him about your state. I'll call you back later. See you. - Good morning. - Good morning. Is that bread? You never tasted it, right? You have first choice. - How did you know? - It's a secret. This apartment has always been... forbidden to men. You're the first one. I'm just saying... How lucky I am, to be chosen as the first male guest! You'll have tea? Or coffee, maybe? I might wanna try some coffee... Just a moment, please. - Say... - What? I feel incredibly good. My head is much clearer. Good. All that was just a hallucination... I think too much. Here. Well? I can't say that it's good. You'll get used to it quickly. I think you'll change your mind. It's like alcohol... At first, I thought it was weird that everyone liked it. Once I got used to it, I couldn't live without it. There was a time when I'd drink all day long. Those were the worst days of my life. Meanwhile, my wife had a lover. She kept her distance. - Say... - What? Shall we go for a car ride? - Good idea. - No bar today! But you have guests tonight. You know everything. You invited Mr. Saeki. You also know Mr. Saeki? He's the real owner of my bar. I remember now... I saw Mr. Namerikawa with Mr. Saeki... He came with him, once or twice. Then why Namerikawa played innocent? I don't know. It's nothing. I don't care. Let's think about our car ride instead. I'll come... I'll close the bar and I'll come. Good. What? Do you want to go out with me? I'm going back to Tokyo tomorrow, and I'm resigning. I'm selling my apartment. I'm coming to live in this small town. I wanna live with you. Ever since I first saw you, I've felt attracted to you. I want to start over with you. I want a new life. What do you say? You can take all the time you want... to give me your answer. OK. Eat more than that. I've put all my heart into it. C'mon, eat! I'll have some more. Sure. Today is ideal weather for a car ride. We're in the sunlight. This movie is a masterpiece. But... I thought you'd never seen a movie before. I love... films. You damn liar...
