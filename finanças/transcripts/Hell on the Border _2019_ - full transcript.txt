For a second there, I thought I finally done enough to see Glory. But my senses is telling me you ain't no angels. Well, you add a few wrinkles, take away a little hair, why, it looks like we got Charlie Storm. Cow rustler, spirit pusher. Mr. Lawman, I'm not exactly well here right now. Give me a little assistance getting out of this mire and I'll turn myself in nice and peaceful like. Well, why don't you just get down and walk out? I'll arrange someone to get your mare. Damn, if I could walk out of here on my own strength, you'd be having this conversation with only my horse here, not me. What do you surmise, Bass? One of us will have to bring him out of that pit. Well, you heard the man. If he could walk in that, he'd be somewhere dancing with the savages. Besides, I ain't dressed for this occasion. See here, what I was trying to say is... I'd walk through, carry him across my shoulders back to you for the iron. So, you're gonna walk seven paces out there, in mud that a horse can't walk in? Yes, sir. Well, if you say it, I wanna see it. Marshal, you gonna let that nigger kill himself and me in the process? You need to watch your mouth, old man. And Mr. Reeves here, he may be a Negro, but he's my posseman. And he may be the one just saves your neck. - I ain't going. - Oh, you going. - Oh, I ain't going. - If'n he makes it out there to you, you very well gonna get on his shoulders and make your way back over here. No, I won't. I'm good right here. Above ground and breathing. That little nigger, he's gonna sink, and he gonna sink with me in it. Quite frankly, I don't really care if you survive or not. Right here it says "dead or alive." And, Mr. Reeves, why don't you try and not sink before you get within arm's shot of this bank here. I don't suspect mud is going to remove from my linens very well. Marshal, you better fix my obit right. "The outlaw Charlie Storm, the most wanted outlaw in the Indian Territory, took a fight on with eight U.S. Marshals and sixteen possemen." You sure you can get me out of this thing? Well, I'll be. Now, Charlie Storm. Charlie Storm. Yep. By the power vested in me... from the federal judge Isaac Parker, I place you under arrest. Let's go, Bass. What is it now? Think I'ma help that mare. Help it do what? Help it out. You know we can't wait on you. Let's go, Charlie. The outlaws here are unruly. The only solution to that unruliness is the rule of law. The law that you were brought here to dispense. Judge Isaac C. Parker... is there a man out of the ones that you sentenced that didn't make a victim out of an innocent man or woman? No, you can bring me the final pardon request for the man that killed his friend. Shouldn't I have a counselor with me? I do not care to speak with you about your legal status. The purpose of my inquiry today is to endeavor to speak with you about softening your heart in preparation for your inevitable meeting with God. You shot your best friend in the back. And it will not be long before you leave this world and enter into eternity. Now, I cannot have mercy on you, but there is one who can pardon your offenses. There is a savior whose blood is sufficient enough to wash this stain from your soul. Now, I beg of you to seek the salvation of His holy cross. Because I cannot, and I shall not pardon your crimes. May God have mercy on you. I didn't realize at the fort there would be so much unruly activity. Well, you know today is the day that Judge Parker is gonna send six souls to meet their maker. Six? At one time? Judge Parker relishes on efficiency. What kind of man hangs six men in the name of efficiency? Sounds more like an outlaw than the law. The law he is. He passed the bar exam when he was 21. He was a city attorney at 23. He left the Democrats 'cause he opposed slavery. Yeah. All that speak he speaks. Only thing I can remember is he hung six souls. - Morning, Judge. - Morning. It's Charlie Storm here. He's ready for his arraignment. Marshal, your prisoner is covered in mud, yet you remain pristine. Well, you know a good marshal know how to bring his man in without sacrificing his stature. - You understand. - Very well. Bring him to the jailer's. I'll arraign him tomorrow. Before noon, around 11:00. Y'all leave me the fuck alone. You know the colored man Bass Reeves? Eh, no, I can't say I do. He broke away from his master during the war. Learned the land, their native tongue before coming here, and, well, Mr. Reeves has been a posseman for a few years now. I reckon it's time for a promotion. You want me to promote a Negro to deputy marshal? Yes, I do. Why do you incessantly push me to do things that are sure to get me fired? I'm doing no such a thing. I'm your assistant, and I'm assisting you. You'd do well just to listen. You know as well as I do, this country, as progressive as it pretends to be, is not ready for a colored marshal. These people, they can only handle so much change. Bass and my Archie homesteaded land together. He'd have told ya, you won't find a man more capable with a pistol. I'll tell ya you won't find a man more loyal to the law. That's the kind of deputy you need. Evening, Bass. Evening, Jessie. You know Judge Parker? Yes, ma'am. Evening, sir. Evening. I'll be seeing you. You're one of our possemen, are you not? Yes, sir. How did you and that horse find the occasion to be so stained by mud? You'd have to ask Marshal Franks, sir. As a federal judge, I'm inquiring of you now, sir. And, frankly, I expect nothing less than a straight answer here. With all respect due you, Marshal Franks is the man I ride for. I will give you $20 federal salary if you speak plainly to me, sir. Judge, there is not a dollar amount that will cause me to betray my employer. Oh, come on. I employ him. He employs you. So, technically, I employ you. What does he pay you anyway? What, $3 a week? I'm offering you 20 to tell me about a horse. I guess I just don't see it that way, sir. Miss Jessie. You care to hear something humorous? I was with Franks today, and he was spit-shine clean. But his prisoner was covered about like you and that horse. When I mentioned that fact to him, he failed to even acknowledge you. Or your name. Good Lord, in Jesus's name, let me know that I'm doing the right thing out here. Wait. I firmly believe that it's been appointed to men to live and die but once. Yet before me stands the soul that I know has departed from this place. You killed my brother. No, wait. I did no such thing. Now, your brother, he did what he did. He got justice. Don't do this. Oh, please, God... Came back to apologize for being rude. Are you Creek? I'm not a boy. I'm Rufus Buck. Rufus Buck. Lord above. Jessie was right about you. She didn't exaggerate at all. I've never seen a man utilize his armaments with such speed and efficiency. I mean, you had that boy dead to rights and you just let him go. Thank you. What's wrong, sir? Sir, I'm not a lawman. And some of those folks was white. You were witness. Well, they drew first. On you and me. You're damn right I'm a witness. So be it. If you the witness, who gonna be the judge? Well, there may be a solution. Bass... Bass? What's wrong? I think I'm... I might be a deputy marshal. You what? Bass... You put a star on your chest, you the target. I've always been the target. It's no difference. You trying to make a widow of me? - I'll just leave right now and save you the trouble. - No, I'm not trying-- Let go of me, Bass George Reeves. Let me alone. We doing just fine with you on the farm and walking with the marshal on occasion. Why now, Bass? Why? Why? 'Cause we got six souls sleeping in the next room. All right, you three go around back and we'll flank the front. Wait. Look, Jim, I know we done come all this way, but I think it's wise for us to call somebody to assist us. Since when did you go yellowbelly? I ain't no yellowbelly, my friend. But you've heard the same stories that I've heard about Dozier. Six of us here, that ain't enough to bring him in. You see this? You see those words? That says "United States Deputy Marshal." I am the United States. And we, as the United States, are gonna go in there and we're gonna take Dozier back to Judge Parker to answer for his crimes. And if any of you are yellow like Tom, you can just go somewhere and bury your face 'cause your country doesn't need you. You see it like you want, but I'm going home. Judge is gonna have your head for this. Maybe, but he might have yours for not listening to reason. You two go around back. Just the five of us? - It's one man, Ned. - I know. Bob Dozier! United States Deputy Marshal Jim Bruce! I have a warrant for your arrest out of the District Court Fort Smith, Arkansas. Your house is surrounded. Turn yourself in now, won't be unnecessary spilling of your blood. Bob Dozier. - United States Deputy-- - I heard you cackle! Repeating yourself is not gonna endo you anymore jurisdiction over me or my person than it did the first time. You might not have heard, but the United States has jurisdiction over the Indian Territory. And this is the Indian Territory. - That right? - Yeah. How's your government get jurisdiction over land it don't own? - Pardon? - This land belongs to the Indian. Savages. Seems to me the Indians should be giving you jurisdiction. Seeing as you stole every piece of land from them, you forced them on this territory, I don't see them doing so. Sir, you must be mistaken. The government doesn't ask for permission. We are the United States, and we are advising you to come on out, or we're coming in there after you. I dare you. Well, go get him. Is anyone left? Oh, yes, United States Deputy Marshal Jim Bruce, someone is left. I told you you do not have jurisdiction over me or my person. Yet you still choose to awaken me from my slumber. Cause a ruckus in my town. Tell me something, Deputy Marshal Jim Bruce, what do you do when a rodent invades your home? That question was not designed to be rhetorical. - You kill it? - Yes! You just don't kill it. You kill it and you send it back to where it came from so that all the other rodents see what happens they get the same idea. Gather the coins that he and the others carry. Put 'em with the gains from last night's coach. We'll give it to the families that need it. Keep the rest so we may eat. I apologize to the women and children who had to witness that defense of self. Bring him to the vault. Bring me my knife. You, government man, are gonna deliver a message for me. It needs to be unmistakable. Look at me. Can you do that? Senator Smith. Word reached that you might be slumbering in these parts. And I heard there are several souls that slumber in these parts at the hand of a black man. One of those gentlemen was white. Now, you know that even here, as progressive as we may be, a Negro cannot shoot a white man without the protection of a shield. Is that what we call a white man that ambushes a judge, - a gentleman? - You miss my meaning. No, never mind, because I intend to name that man deputy marshal. Retroactively protecting his bravery last night. You do realize that if you name that Negro, the one that lacks the good sense not to shoot down a white man and he fails, it will be a setback for the whole Negro race. - Senator, let me tell you-- - No, no, you hear me out. You hear me out. I nominated you because I trust your judgment. President Grant believes in liberty of the Negro. He is fighting that unrest in the South. But in order to protect our progress, we have to nurture the Negro. Not just set 'em fully free. I mean, they're ready to be free, but are they ready to lead? And if he fails, there's likely not to be another one around for 100 years. So, can you tell me just what it is about this Negro that makes you believe that he is worthy to carry that burden? Well, I don't know if it's fair to hoist the burden of an entire race upon his shoulders. Your Honor, - I know you to be a man of the church. - Yes, sir. - And the law. - Mm-hmm. But are you willing to gamble your seat on the bench for that man? I never gamble. Deputy Marshal Reeves. Well done, sir. Judge, I'm sorry, but I've buried my words far too long. Now, I fancy Mr. Reeves here as a posseman. And you know I do, but you bring a dishonor-- a dishonor on the name of the marshal by naming him. Franks, Negro or not, in the course of a day, I've known this man to rescue a horse, rescue an outlaw, and bring him to justice, save a judge from perish from five men, and refuse a payment worth many times his monthly salary simply to provide information. Now, if those actions do not quality that man there to ride as a deputy marshal in my district, then I might just pull the stars off every man here. - Judge, you're making-- - Including yours. No outlaw will file for a black man with a badge. He'll be dead in a week. Save them kids. Who said that? Now, there will be order in this court. I'll clear this whole gallery. Delivery here Judge Parker. - I'm Judge Parker. Just set it there. - Yes, sir. Okay. Yes, sir. Judge, you may not know, why, Mr. Reeves here, he can't read. And if he can't read, well, he can't write. Is that right, Bass? That's right, sir. Can you tell me how is it that you come to shoot like a man possessed but you can't read? My generation was not born free. My master taught me to shoot, but he refused to teach me to read. Said that have made me too dangerous. More dangerous than you are with those Colts? Well, how in God's good name is he going to read a warrant and ensure that he brings in the right man? We don't need litigation by negligence caused by a Negro. - Um... - Tell him, Marshal Franks. My husband may not read... but you will respect him. My husband Bass can be and will be a deputy worth remembering. Okay, now, we've heard you. We'll have order in this court. May I? Bass, you know I can't do that. There are no coloreds allowed in the bar. What is that awful smell in my courtroom? Judge, I suspect the smell is coming from this here package. Open it up. Judge, you ain't gonna like it. It's horrible, Judge, horrible. Jeez. That head was a promise. It was a promise, and it was a promise fulfilled. Now, you let him stay where he is. Should he make his way into town, then you let the law have its way with him. Bruce went on a fool's errand. And he returned home slight of his body. Well, be that as it may... is there anyone here... who will execute service of this here warrant? Anyone? No one... under the authority of this court here shall stand above the law. Judge, ain't nobody ill enough in their right mind to take on that assignment. You chase an animal in its own habitat, and it's simply suicide. I will. Oh, that's good. Mr. Reeves... you aren't a deputy. It seems, sir, that we both have a problem and a solution. You need someone to put an end to Dozier's terror, and I need to prove I would be a more-than-capable deputy. Both problems solved by the same solution. If I can bring him back, you put a badge on my chest. So this man here, who many of you feel isn't worthy enough to strap your boots, this man has more courage than any of you all combined. Now, if I grant this request... is there anybody that will ride with him? - I ride alone. - No, Mr. Reeves. As much as it might be your inclination to do so, you will not ride alone. My orders. Who will ride with him? Ain't nobody going back to hell to chase that man. We're kinda partial to having our heads attached to our torso. I will. Pardon my crime, shit, I'll ride with the nigger. Well, you wouldn't be the first outlaw put on a straight path by being a posseman. You are charged with some serious crimes, sir. You would likely fall upon the ground if put in prison being as old as you are. Upon execution of this warrant with Mr. Reeves here... I will pardon you. - What's his name? - Charlie Storm. Pleased to meet you. All right, you ain't so bad for somebody that hung all them sons of bitches. Oh, I get it. We got a Negro and a senile old man to bring in the most notorious outlaw in this territory.

Thing about the government is they don't like to lose. Won't pick a fight if the decks are stacked. Around here, we own the decks. They know that. Let's ride. I need to see Judge Parker now, missy. I have orders from his boss, President Grant, not to appoint Bass Reeves U.S. Marshal and to have him arrested forthwith. I'm sorry, Senator. Judge Parker's not in the office today. Nor is Mr. Reeves. - Where in the hell is he? - I don't know, sir. But they both have a home. I'll be sure to pass the message along. Have good day now. Nellie, would you send Bass out, so we can allow him to answer to the proper authority? It ain't nothing he needs to answer for. Gentlemen, Mr. Reeves is not here. And it would behoove you to lay those arms aside. Should one of her innocent children get harmed, I dare not be the man to stand between that person and Bass Reeves. Put your arms away, boys. It'd be nice if you did, too, ma'am. I have orders here from President Grant, delivered from Senator Smith, that Mr. Reeves stand trial. Should they succeed in their endeavor, I'll take it up with President Grant myself. - If not-- - No "if not." Bass Reeves is coming home. Of course. Sorry, ma'am. See all them men got sent to their grave? Son of bitches no better than the outlaws out here. You know, I'm gonna just pull my horse up and turn around if I don't get some straight talk. All right, wait a minute, how's a nigger get land? You can't own land, can you? You got a pretty wife, you know. How'd an ugly son of a bitch like you get such a pretty wife? Don't you speak of my wife. Oh, so he can talk. - I talk when I need it. - Uh-huh. - And don't you speak of my wife. - All right. Don't you worry about it. I'm not gonna speak at all. I don't know if you realize this, but you can't get him without me. I don't need you or nobody out here. We've been riding for two days. We haven't seen a soul. You even have a plan, or you just get up and go? No time to plan. Well, shit, there's always time for planning. Plans are the difference between being a cow rustler and a spirit pusher and being wanted for killing somebody and having to face that hanging judge of yours. What you trying to say? You done killed somebody and got away with it? I'm just saying what I said. Yo, shut up, Charlie. You ain't nothing but bluster. Probably can't even hit a lick. Can't even hit a buffalo in a herd. - Shit. - You know, I'm starting to think riding to Detroit would've been easier on my nerves than riding with you. You know, your pardon doesn't depend on how many words you speak. Oh, I know. I just find joy in talking. Besides, you should thank that God you sing to I can shoot pretty good, too. Yeah, okay. Okay? Okay? Yeah, okay. Point. - We do not have time for this. - No, no, no, no. You just called my ability into question. Let me put your mind at ease. I'm either going to prove you right or wrong. Now point. That rock. Which one? - All right, let me bring it closer. - No, no, no. You don't have to bring it closer. The big rock in between the-- - In between the trees. - I got you. That wasn't me. Let's go. Why'd you tear off like that? They needed help, I helped. You don't get it, do you? Them people might've been dead. You just go off without no plan. Just tear off like that. Don't they teach you niggers anything about patience? You're such a coon. That is the last time you use that word around me. That's why you swung on me? I-- I don't mean nothing by it! That's what my pappy taught me. Horse, nig-- Okay, okay, okay. It don't mean nothing coming from me. - Well, it means something coming to me. - Well, all right. Shit. All I'm trying to say is... - ...you're all coon and no crow. - What? Coon, coon. You know, an animal-- coon. He come into your house, he takes what he wants, and he leaves, he's fearless. Now, a crow. A crow wants a nut, he don't want to break his beak. He'll drop that nut in the middle of the road, wait for a wagon to come by, break it, pick it up, take his bounty and leave. It's called patience. Now, you making no sense, Charlie Storm. I'm making a lot of sense. And you'll get it... as soon as you get it. Gentlemen, sorry to disturb your brotherly spat, but the sun'll be set before you settle. ♪ The time has come ♪ ♪ For us to part in the parting band ♪ ♪ So farewell, friends ♪ ♪ Farewell ♪ Sweet song. Why you getting shot at? Well, we been moving our people from the south to this fertile ground in Kansas. Been doing that since '72. But the federal government been moving their troops out the south. So we had to find a new route. You should come. Just planted our first collard. Been fetchin' for people. Got about 600 right now. I got land. - You own it? - I homestead it. '66, when the law changed. Became a citizen. Federal government approved me. Homestead. You heard of taxes? Landlords? I was an undertaker back there in Nashville. And sometimes I'd have to bury fathers. Maybe by the next morning, that landlord would go to that mother, she'd have about six or seven children. And that landlord would tell her, "Your husband owed me before he died." And then he'd say, "You have to go some other place, I cannot take care of you." Now, that's something I would take notice of. Sooner or later, you find her coming out some disorderly house. And those children? State prison. Sounds like tales of Exodus. I thought old Abe set you free. Although the law say we free, the South still sends for us with money on our heads. They call that a Southern bounty group. Southern country is out of joint, sir. And it's coming west. They running out of land already. And when they come, they're bringing all their ills with them. I know, the blood of a white man runs through my veins. There is some good white men in the Southern country. But it ain't the majority, to which you just might fit. Yeah. Maybe I would. Maybe you just don't know what you want, but I do.

Why do I care? I'm saying, are they kin to you? - They got to be kin for me to care? - Maybe not. But to approach a stranger seeking information, I would judge you to be kin or crazy. Well, I ain't kin. Well, then you must be crazy. I didn't get your name. Well, I'm Frank James. This is my brother Jesse. And this firecracker right here, - well, that's Belle. - Belle? Belle Starr, of the Sam Starr Gang. So if that name means something, I suggest you be on your way. James, of the Younger Gang? Yeah, they call us that. Well, thanks for the information on your compadre. I think we'll be going to find him now and congratulate him. Okay. What'd you put inside of the hole? Just our dog. That's a mighty big hole for a dog. He was a mighty big dog. Come on. You kin to him? - Do I look like him? - Little bit. Sure don't sound like him, though. Where you from? Scotland. Where's that? Europe. Read about it. Pinkerton's from there. Pinkerton? You mean that motherfucker-- can't catch Jesse James? Yeah. He's about as skillful as... What's going on up there? We got to go.

You thinking about going alone? Well, you got one arm, you liquored, you'll slow me down. All right. Go on, then... make a widow of your wife, orphan of them kids. Go on! Bad-ass Bass Reeves. The man who rides with nobody by his side. Shit. Well, go on. He may be slow of tongue, but his words are sharp. Now, Dozier may have some men, but he don't need them anymore-- Well, what good are you?! You got one arm. You can't even go a day without drinking. The border's right there. Why don't you run? You don't have to finish. Buddy, I seen what you did to Dozier's men. If you only had some help. I mean, what I'm trying to say is, if you insist on going after what you now know... then fuck it! I'll go too. But we better pray my boots become unstuck. Yeah, I could run. I could be headed for the border. Keep taking what I want, shoot anybody who doesn't want to give it to me. Or maybe I could do something. You know, something... Worthy... of a proper obit. Huh? Something worth writing about. Why don't you go home? You're the one with the family. Leave this fool's errand to this coward here. And this old drunk outlaw. If I leave... Who's gonna save ya from the fool's folly? Thatta boy! Thatta boy. Yow! "I'll annointest my hand with oil. My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life." 40 men on three. That's not odds I'd take if I was a gambler. Yeah, you win at them odds, you a legend. All right, we wait till nightfall, circle the town, then we jump them before daybreak. That's it? That's what you want to do? That's why we came. We circled this before, and there were six of us, or five. And he was alone. And he still lives. Did you go in by surprise? No, the stupid bastard announced-- Well, you don't knock on the Devil's door and ask to come in. You wait till nightfall. You go in real quiet-like, you take out every man that's posted. You make your way through the house, you get to his bedroom, you surround the motherfucker, he comes out with you. Dead or alive. Nightfall it is. ♪ There was a time ♪ ♪ Everything so supreme ♪ And I threw that man right through the window. Then the boss rides up, lights some dynamite, tosses it in the house, we ride off, and then boom! Whole ground shook. Is that it? One for me, and one for-- No, I'm good. I'm gonna go sleep off this fun. The stage comes through tomorrow. We pull this off my way, this town eats for a year. ♪ You may run for a long time ♪ ♪ Run on for a long time ♪ ♪ Run on for a long time ♪ ♪ Let me tell you that God's gonna cut you down ♪ ♪ Let me tell you that God's gonna cut you down ♪ That's about gonnavdo it for me. ♪ My God spoke and He spoke so sweet ♪ ♪ I thought I heard the shuffle of angels' feet ♪ ♪ And he put hand upon my head ♪ ♪ Great God almighty, I'll tell you what he said ♪ It's time. ♪ Go tell her long tongue liar ♪ ♪ Tell that midnight rider ♪ ♪ Tell the gamblers, the ramblers ♪ ♪ The back biters ♪ ♪ Tell them that God's gonna cut them down ♪ Look a little lost there, fella. I'm just passing through. You the law? I don't know of any colored lawmen around these parts. Come on. Oh! Easy... If you've come for Dozier, we ain't got no quarrel. I do what I do out here just not to die. Where does Dozier keep his horse? Outside his house. Especially since that marshal showed up, woods are dangerous over there. You're a lucky man. Lord, tell me if I should act now. I'm sorry, Lord. I was kind of hoping you'd be louder. But you didn't say no. You killed a dear friend of mine. You tried to kill me too. You didn't die. Like I said before, I'm here to return you to Fort Smith. By the power given me by the Federal Court. You can cackle all you want. You and no Federal Court has any jurisdiction over me. Then maybe I'll just shoot you dead now. Just pull this trigger. You won't. 'Cause you ain't me. You don't like to shoot first or you would have done so when my men surrounded you, no? But me? I'd shoot you dead. You better be a good shot. I'm better than good. Did you know I used to be a deputy marshal? - That doesn't matter. - It matters. But your government accused me a robbery. Stripped me of my star. And lashed me to confess, locked me up. I lost my family. Yellow fever. Couldn't do nothing. My Annie was the purest thing I'd ever seen. So was my Corina, but they met the dirt. Like an outlaw. Because law wasn't reasonable, and my wife and my baby died. It was made very clear to me that I was to pursue my earnest desires. Because living is to live... and then you die. That may well be. Jim Bruce, Sam Sixkiller, Belle Starr's brother no longer living, and you are. But you gonna do your living and dying in Detroit prison. Oh, you ain't leaving here tonight, colored boy! You should have thought this through. Ah! Get him! Charlie! Giddup! Go get that son of a bitch! Now, it's too dangerous for you. I'm gonna be back. But if I don't, you make sure you take Nellie and my little ones where they need to be. Cheer up. I gotta give it to you! Only one moving! You and me would've made a hell of a team in another life, nigger and all. Why don't you come out now and have a fair fight? I told you, lawman, government doesn't have any jurisdiction over me. Dead or alive. Thank you. Well, old man, you got the spirit to ride or should I just retire you here? You wish. - Tom, you coming? - No. I think Spanish Fort is a place that needs some looking after. Well, if anybody ever says Tom Pinkerton's a coward, - you just send them my way. - Thanks. Come on, Jake. Hey, Charlie! I got my boots unstuck! You crazy. You gentlemen are making a mistake. No, Your Honor, you made the mistake. Good people of Fort Smith? Gather the paper writers! Charlie Storm and Bass Reeves have returned with the bounty! Y'all ain't gonna believe this. None of you said we could do it, did you? We done brought back an outlaw that has killed many lawmen, innocent people, and others. We done brought back Bob Dozier! Nellie, Bass is back! They killed Dozier! I thought you was dead. I've been thinking about my obit. Oh, not this again. You are no longer an outlaw. That's my point. What's a good obit for a lawman? Bass Reeves! For some reason... I think you gonna have plenty of time. Well, you know. You can't be too careful. Gentlemen. Mr. Reeves, you may enter the bar. Here and in any court I preside in as long as there's breath in my body. Please, sir, come forward. You have something for us, Judge? I have a stack of warrants for you. - No less than 3,000. - Ma'am. Oh, and, Mr. Reeves, I think you'll need this.
