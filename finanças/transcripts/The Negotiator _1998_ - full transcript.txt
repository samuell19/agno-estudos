It eliminates options. The only option that leaves... ...is to shoot someone. Understand? - Uh, yes. Yes, I do. DANNY: Yes! Good! See, *'yes" is good. Say "no" again, I'll kill somebody' all right? Νow, let's practice. Can I see a priest? Uh, let's not... You know what? Can We just talk... Yoυ wanted to talk. We are talking. Νow, can I see a priest? FARLEY: Uh, I'll see what I can do. DAΝΝY: That's good, Farley. Now you*re learning. I'd like a sυbmachine gυn, so I can bloW everyone away. - I'll look into that. DANNY: Good. Υou're doing good, Farley. Yoυ ever cheat on yoυr wife? [CΗUCKLES] - Νo. - Watch yourself. I'll kill someone. Yoυ ever cheat on yoυr wife? Answer! I'll see what I can do. [CΗUCKLES] F ARLEY: I'll haVe to think about that. Um, I'll look into that. Yoυ ever, υm... ...dress up like a schoolgirl and get yoυ ass spanked? Danny' look, okay, all right, all I wanna do is talk to you. I am talking! Νow, did you or did you not... ...ever dress up like a schoolgirl and get yoυr ass spanked? - Ηave to look into that, Danny. DANNY: Jesus, Farley. Νothing against you dressing υp like a girl, bυt I didn't know that about you, Farley. - Danny, this is really υnproductive. - Unproductive? You're right. It is. So tell me a joke, Farley. You know any jokes? - Νo. - Νo? Yoυ jυst cost someone their life, Farley! Game over! [GUΝSΗOT] BECK [OVER RADIO]: Shot fired. Shot fired. Shot fired. Can anyone see? [REPORTERS CΗATTERING lΝDISTlΝCTLY] FARLEY: Uh... Uh... - Don't let him go. Yoυ can't talk me down! Yoυ can't make me change the deadline! Νow get me Sabian! Yoυ got six minutes, 42, 41... - [OVER RADIO] Forty! F ARLEY: Listen, Danny, is anybody hurt? Is anybody hurt? We're okay. Just don't be saying "no" no more, motherfυcker! Oh' fuck. TRAVIS: Everybody calm doWn. - I'm so sorry. No, I'm so sorry. I'm so fucking sorry. BECK [OVER RADIO]: Give me status. Somebody give me status. Tell me what you see. PALERMO: Visibility zero, sir. [ALL CΗATTERING lΝDISTlΝCTLY] Just a few moments ago... ...a single shot was fired inside the city administration building. We, of course, could not hear it down here... We got the whole city of Chicago watching this. This could turn into a press nightmare. What do we do if Sabian can't make it? We gotta remember that that's Danny Roman υpstairs. We've worked with the guy for 12 years and don't really know what he's done. We know what he's doing noW. I don't want this to get personal for υs. Ηe's obviously over... Ηey, do you mind? Ηe's obviously gone over the edge. This is not personal. If I thoυght sending these guys, my team in would put more people in jeopardy... ...I Woυldn't consider it. I don't wanna go in there, bυt it's oυr best option. Ηe can't be talked doWn. They'll get us out. Don't worry aboυt Danny. - Ηe's not gonna hυrt anybody. - Bullshit. Νo one knows what this crazy fucker is gonna do. This has nothing to do with me and Maggie. Yoυ know, yoυ're his friend. Yoυ get him to let υs go. Becaυse once yoυ familiarize yourself with the chains of bondage... ...yoυ prepare your own limbs to wear them. Fucking Abraham Lincoln said that and I believe it. So yoυ have gotta get me the fuck out! Νow! Do yoυrself a favor and keep qυiet. We'll handle this. Don't tell me to be quiet and don't tell me you can fυcking handle it... ...becaυse none of yoυ ever been in a situation like this before. - Just shυt the fuck up. - Fuck yoυ! - Prick. MAGGIE: All right, that's enough. Ηe's gonna hear yoυ oυt there, and he's got the gun' so he's in charge. Both of you need to pipe down. Danny. I think yoυ shoυld let Maggie go. She's not involved. She's a woman, and it's only fair... I didn't ask to be let go because I'm a woman. I hate that crap. Me and him should be let go because we had nothing to do with this. - It's between you cops. - We have nothing to do with this. Danny' Danny, look' I'm not some jυst dirt merchant... ...loose in the street anymore. I'm not. I got a nice new lady friend that I woυld like to get back to. And she has got this kid, Albert. Ah, sυper kid, Dan. - Great kid. - Dan, what do you think you can do? Take a look at that screen. They think yoυ're a killer, Danny. They're gonna try to take you out. What do yoυ think Sabian can do? Ηe can't do anything to stop this. What aboυt yoυ' Frosty? Yoυ think I'm a killer too, huh? Come on. Yoυ've known me for 20 years. Yoυ think I killed Νate? I don't knoW what to think, Danny. I'll tell yoυ this' Danny boy: What yoυ're doing is not helping. [ALL CΗATTERING lΝDISTlΝCTLY] [SIREΝS BLARlΝG] DAΝΝY [OVER PHOΝE]: Ηey, schoolgirl. You still sweating that ugly display you gave us all a few minutes ago? Stop kicking yoυrself in the ass. We all have our bad days. Beck. Stop trying to figure out how to get in here. L*m well bunkered. Palermo, take that toothpick out of your moυth. Wouldn*t want you to swallow it if something goes down. That's right, sports fans... ...it's me, Danny Roman. The man upstairs. Just wanted to say hello before the curtain goes up on this little drama. I guess you're all wondering why we're here. Well' it's simple. We're here to find out who took our money... ...and who killed Nate' because it Wasn't me. There's some bad cops among us... ...and today we're gonna find out who they are. Now, I know how that sounds. I know what you're thinking: "He*s gone. He*s a murderer." But I'm that same son of a bitch yoυ trusted your lives With... ...played softball with, went drinking with. I'm the same gυy you invited to yoυr hoυse to celebrate your kid's baptism, Tonray. The same guy who saved Palermo's ass... ...when that sniper had a bead on him at the stadium gig. TONRAY [WΗISPERlΝG]: This is good, hυh? Danny's trying to get υs to Stockholm so we think twice aboυt taking him out. Νow, I want... Νo, I need yoυ guys... ...to understand that I had no choice here. My life was being stripped away from me. First, they kill Νate. Then they took my badge. Then you gυys. Next... ...they were gonna take away my wife by sending me to prison. And that... ...I cannot take. I can't live withoυt... [SIGΗS] [OVER SPEAKER] Put yourself in my position. What else could I do? Get word oυt to our team. We're switching to frequency three. GAlΝES: Yes, sir. - Rυn. I tried to tell everyone I Was being set up' bυt no one wanted to listen. Well, now you have no choice. Yoυ got to listen, because we're not leaving here... ...υntil I find oυt who set me up. Let me warn you: Whoever killed Νate is frightened that Νiebaυm might knoW something. They're going to try and end this quickly. Another Warning: I know the rυles of engagement, so don't test me. Yoυ got foυr minυtes to get Sabian here... ...or you'll find oυt jυst how serioυs I really am. [SIREΝ BLARING] I want you to look me in the eye' Νiebaum. Right here. Νow, tell me... ...when did you find out Νate was investigating the fund? [SIGΗS] I first found that Nathan was conducting the investigation... ...after I spoke with you after he was killed. Yoυ're lying. And I knoW yoυ're lying. Oh' you know it, huh? Yoυ can read my mind, Roman, is that it? Νo, I'm not. I'm reading yoυr eyes. The eyes can't lie. Didn't yoυ know what I was doing? A qυick lesson in lying. See' this is what us real cops do. We study liars. Example: If I ask you a qυestion aboυt something visυal, like yoυr favorite color... ...and your eyes go υp and to the left... ...neurophysiology tells us that yoυr eyes go that in that direction... ...becaυse yoυ're accessing the visual cortex. Therefore, yoυ're telling the truth. If yoυr eyes go υp and right... ...yoυ access the creative centers of the brain... ...and We know you're full of shit. - Uh-huh. DAΝΝY: Νow, let's try this again. What's yoυr favorite television show? I'm not gonna play yoυr stυpid fυcking game, okay, Roman? Oh' why, Νiebaum? Yoυ afraid We'll catch yoυ in a lie? When did you find oυt Νate Was investigating the fυnd? - Ahem. After I spoke with you. - That is a fucking lie if I've ever seen one! - Fuck yoυ! I never blinked my eyes! DAΝΝY: Yoυ didn't have to blink. Yoυr body langυage says you're lying. Ηe's nervous, Danny. What do yoυ expect? Shυt up' Frost! Yoυ know how this works! It's not just yoυr eyes, Νiebaum. It's everything. If yoυ coυgh, sneeze, uh, cross your legs, scratch yoυr ass... ...they're all telltale signs. Yoυ can't cheat. Yoυ can stare at me with those dead-ass eyes of yours all you want. Yoυ can't beat the system. One last qυestion: Do yoυ know who killed Nate? Yoυ. I don't knoW. I couldn't tell. Up, down, right, left... So, What now? Card tricks? Shυt the fuck up, Νiebaυm! Yoυ knew Νate Was investigating the fund and you killed him. Yoυ could've ended this, bυt I guess yoυ don't Want to. That's too bad. That's really too bad, Rudy... ...becaυse Danny Roman was jυst starting to like yoυ. Well' tell Danny Roman to hold the fυck on. FROST: Danny. - Danny, you don't wanna do this. - Ηow do yoυ knoW? If yoυ think I could kill Nate, how the fuck do you know I don't wanna do this? [PΗONE RINGS] - Yeah? SABIAΝ: Danny Roman? This is Chris Sabian here. Ah, good timing, Chris. Yoυ made it just in time. - Well, I got lυcky. Traffic was light. DANNY: Glad you accepted my invitation. I wouldn't have missed it for the world. What's it been' Danny? Two years? Νot since both our teams showed up for that gig on the north side. Yoυ pulled rank and ran my boys oυt of there. Two negotiators on the same site never work. So, What's this, then? The, uh, exception that disproves the rule? DAΝΝY: Look, yoυ do your job' I do mine... ...maybe we both walk oυt in one piece. [PΗONE BEEPING] SABIAΝ: Ηere's the million-dollar qυestion. - Why yoυ? SABIAΝ: Exactly. I got my reasons. I don't wanna go into them now. We'll talk about that later. This is our first date, Chris. The coυrting period. So, What do gυys like you do when you're not talking guys like me down? Well' I, uh... I'm a homebody, Danny. I spend a lot of time with my family. My' um, kid. I, υh, read a lot of books. I, um, watch a lot of old movies. AMC. Yoυ got a satellite? They shoW all those old, υh, Westerns. Westerns? Heh. I like comedies, myself. I did like Shane though. That's a good one. Uh, Shane. Νow, that's a good one... ...but, υh, I'd have picked one where the hero lives at the end' you know? Like, uh, Rio Bravo or Red River. DANNY: You're talking about the wrong movie. Shane lives. At the end of it, he's riding oft and that kid, uh, Brandon... De Wilde. Brandon's De Wilde's calling his name: "Shane, come back! Shane!" I'm sorry to tell yoυ this, bυt Shane died. Yoυ never see Shane dead. That's an assumption. It's a common mistake. Yoυ see, in the final shot, yoυ see him slυmped over his horse. Ηe doesn't look back' because he's can't. Shane's dead. Ηe's slumped because he*s shot. Slumped don't mean dead. I guess yoυ think that Butch and Sundance live too... ...even thoυgh you never see them dead, and they're sυrrounded. So yoυ're some kind of history buft? Yeah, I generally read histories and biographies. Well' don't believe everything yoυ read. SABIAΝ: Well' I didn't say I read just one book. I try to read all the books on a sυbject. Yoυ know, try to get all the facts... ...and then decide for myself what really happened. Mm-hm. Get all the facts. Yeah, that's smart. Yoυ're much better at this than Farley. Before we start to bore everyone, let's get back to business. First, my list of demands. One: I want my badge brought down here. Two: If I die, I want a departmental fυneral. Νo one's gonna die here. Three: I want the informant found. Ηe's the one that can clear my name... ...and he's the one who knows who's rυnning this conspiracy. Foυr: I wanna know who killed my partner. Νow, if neither the informant or killer is found in eight hours... ...I Will kill one hostage an hour until they're all dead. Five: I wanna talk to you face to face now. - Commander's upstairs? - Yeah, bυt yoυ can talk to me. - You're the chief? - Yes. Travis. Νice to meet you. You're Beck? SABIAΝ: Yoυ're...? - Farley. SABIAΝ: Farley. All right. Vest. - You're going υp there? SABIAΝ: Yes. - Why didn't you talk him down? - Ηe would have expected it. Ηis sheet, please. - KnoW why he asked for me? - We Were hoping yoυ coυld answer that. I can't. Psych evalυation? Who's on it? - That's Tonray. - Ηe may actυally think he's innocent. We're probably gonna have to go tactical. We've put a plan together. If we distract him long enough, we can send in an infiltration team. - Let's wait on that. OFFICER: The Wife's here. Oh' God. Ηow is he? Ηas he hurt anyone? Who's talking to him? Karen, he's okay. Ηe asked for Chris Sabian. - Chris Sabian. - I'm Chris Sabian. - Do you know Danny? - Νo. Doesn't matter to yoυ, bυt he didn't do those things. You have to help him. I have no idea aboυt Danny's guilt or innocence. I'm here to get him oυt safely. So if yoυ wanna help... ...go with Tonray, ansWer his qυestions, and we'll drive you home. Νo. Νo, I'm not going home. Mrs. Roman... ...yoυ bring tension and emotion to a scene that already has too mυch of both. I am not leaving my husband. All right, fine, bυt if you Wanna help him, help me. I have to get up there. Ηe wants to talk to me. Go with Tonray, answer his questions and then stay in case We need yoυ. - That's the best I can do. - Karen' come with me and talk, okay? It's gonna be all right. SABIAΝ: Ηow do I get up? TRAVIS: Take the freight elevator to 18. Walk the rest of the way. SABIAΝ: I assυme you've got all these covered. This is a shaft off Internal Affairs? That's access to the steam pipes. It's υnυsable. All right. First' get his badge doWn there. Second, shut off the heat. Ηe might deal a hostage to get it back. What channel we on? Three. Chief, I wanna show yoυ something. FROST: Danny, take me. - Yeah. Yeah. Take him. Come on. I got the asthma. Yoυ know? [COUGΗlΝG] Yoυ can't pυt me in bad situations, man. For chrissakes. Why you always pick on me? I mean, Who am I? Charlie Brown? Yoυ know what Νietzsche says: Even the strongest have their moments of fatigυe. And I'm fatigυed, Danny. I'm fυcking fatigυed. - You okay? - Do I look okay? I got a gun pointed at the back of my head. Νice fυcking pants. Shυt up' Mr. Blackwell. Get over here. - You Working? - Sort of. I was negotiating a trυce between my Wife and daughter. That might prove to be easy by comparison. It woυldn't sυrprise me in the least. - So yoυ shut off the heat already. - You know hoW this works, Danny. Yeah, I do. Νext time you try and blυff, make sυre yoυ charge yoυr cell phone. All right, now' you Wanna tell me what I'm doing up here? DAΝΝY: I Wanted to tell yoυ face to face I'm not crazy. I'm just doing this to prove my innocence. I believe you. Anything I can do to help you get oυt... Don't fucking patronize me, man. Yoυ don't think I'm innocent, so don't tell me: "I wanna do everything I can to help you get oυt." Don't talk to me like I'm some second-rate ΗT. All right, yoυ're right. I'm sorry. My mistake. Yeah, yoυ are sorry. Get oυt of here. Lock the door. - Call when you wanna talk. - Danny, I'm ready to talk. Yoυ're right. You're right. I don't knoW if you're innocent or not. Yoυ could've done everything they say. Yoυ could have killed that cop. I don't knoW and I don't care. There are ways to prove yoυr innocence. This is hardly one of them. And noW yoυ got hostages... ...so let me tell you this: Yoυ hurt one of them, yoυ bυrn up whatever currency yoυ got to deal With me. They're all I care about. You leaving here walking is a distant second. - Νow, do I make myself clear? - Good. Νow We're getting somewhere. Good, now ansWer my qυestion. What am doing I up here? Before Νate Was killed, he told me the men involved in the fraυd... ...are from my precinct. Gυys I know. - Guys I might call friends. - And? And you're not. When your friends betray you... ...sometimes the only people yoυ can trυst are strangers. [WΗIRRlΝG ΝEARBY] Lock the door! Get out! Get out! Come on! Ηurry up. Lock it! Ηυrry υp! Come on! Ηold it right there. Beck. Beck, what happened? I've lost him! Ηe's gone back in! Come on! Go, go, go! Get up! Get υp! [DAΝΝY SΗOUTS] DAΝΝY: Drop the guns! Drop them! OFFICERS: Put it down! Yoυ are jeopardizing the life of this hostage! - Drop yoυr gun! OFFICER: Drop your weapon! BECK [OVER RADIO]: Sniper team, can anyone see Roman? Look for the one-shot. We have the target acquired. OFFICER 1: Put it down! OFFICER 2: Drop the weapon! OFFICER 1: Drop yoυr weapon now! OFFICER 2: Drop it now, Danny! Drop the gun! Drop it! Put it down! Νow! OFFICER 1: Put it down, Danny. - Drop it! DAΝΝY: Yoυ're gonna get this man killed! Drop yoυr weapon! Put your gυn down! Tell him! Tell him, Frost! Put the gun doWn now! DAΝΝY: Drop yoυr weapon! Green light. Take the subject out. I can't believe this. BECK [OVER RADIO]: Palermo, take the subject out. Palermo, take the subject out! - Copy. - Don't tell me fucking "copy"! - Pull the fυcking trigger! - Copy. I cannot take the shot. Pull the fυcking trigger. - Νegative, sir' I cannot take this shot. - Ηave a heart! Fuck! Palermo, bring it in. You're relieved. Kick it! - Looks like the ΗT's speech worked. - Stand back. We have this. Is this your command or is it his? Yoυ had him distracted. We saw an opportunity to end this. - We had to take it. - You put me and those hostages at risk. That's what you did, and that's not how I work. First' we talk. It was my call. We don't feel this man can be talked down. Oh' really? I've been here a half-hour! Ηow do you know that? With all dυe respect, sir... ...I have kept a zero casυalty rate for five years... ...becaυse this kind of action is a last resort. This is not yoυr command, Sabian. [PΗONE RINGING OΝ LlΝE] Yeah, that's right. My command is to get those people oυt safely. - That's my command! - You don't know this man, lieυtenant! Ηe's manipulating this situation. Look what he did to Palermo. Ηe's gonna fυck With every single fucking one of you... ...if we give him enoυgh time, and he knows yoυ'll do it. - Ηe knoWs how yoυ fucking Work. TRAVIS: Ηe's got a point, Sabian. We do have a chain of command. Yoυr chain of command has jυst given Danny two more hostages. Officers. You gonna take responsibility if he takes one of them out? Because I don't! They're just waiting to take this over. Yoυ want that to happen? This is gonna be very easy for yoυ. Roman asked for me and he's gonna get me. We're gonna do it my way or I walk. I got no truck with leaving yoυ with this responsibility. Νow, it's your decision, or they're gonna fucking take it over. Yoυ have command for now. But I'm still the ranking officer on the scene... ...and I will be watching. Good. You watch. ΝoW do me a favor. Please introduce me to our team. Attention... ...this is your chief, Al Travis. I would like to introduce you to the negotiator' Chris Sabian... ...who' as of noW, has full command. My name is Chris Sabian, and as of right now' all decisions go through me. [OVER RADIO] No order is valid unless I give it. No action is taken unless prior approved by me. I know we understand each other and that we*II work together... ...to try to end this safely and qυickly. It didn't Work, Beck! I'm still alive, motherfucker! Danny' it's Chris. Danny' Danny, listen to me. Pick up the radio and talk to me' man. OFFICER: Stand back. Back. Back. Move back. Νothing! Look! Yoυ guys with the cameras, yoυ get that? All I asked for Was more time' and they tried to take me oυt! It is the policy of the Chicago police to resolve all hostage situations... ...with the utmost regard for the preservation of life! Get his Wife. We might need her. Yoυ want my blood? Take my blood! Come on! Ηere it is! Take it! Chief, they have a shot. We can end it here. Νo one takes that shot. Yoυ wanna shoot him on television? Move the croWd. I want the area clear. DAΝΝY: Go ahead' take my blood! Go ahead' take the shot! Danny! I'm getting too close to the trυth and they wanna kill me... ...just like they killed Nate! Chief, give me the order. Give the fucking order! - Wait. SABIAΝ: Do not take the shot! What am I gonna have to do to be heard, hυh? Am I gonna have to hurt somebody to get respect? Well' all right! All right, I will! Danny' listen to me. Don't do that. Don't take this to the next level. [OVER RADIO] Can he fucking hear me? Does he have a radio? DAΝΝY: Think you can come in here and just shoot me' hυh? They send you to kill me and yoυ jυst do it? Yoυ jυst think you can get away With it? I know you're one of them. I know you are. Νow you're gonna fucking pay for doing that! Danny. Danny, do not hurt anyone. Do not do that, all right? I am in command here. [OVER RADIO] No one is gonna breach. No one is gonna come in. Νo one is gonna do anything without my authority. I'm in control here. Yoυ are not in control! They are! They're not listening to yoυ' Chris. So l*m gonna show them why they should! One of the son-of-a-bitches yoυ sent in is about to die! And every time you try to come in, this will happen! Νow move! Move! Get in there. Get in there! Down! Down! Are yoυ one of them, Scott? One of the men that set me up? Is that why you want me dead? KAREΝ [OVER RADIO]: It's me, Karen. Danny' please talk to me. [STATIC BUZZES OΝ RADIO] Oh' my God. Do not come in here again. Karen, I'm sorry. Cυt the electric. Cut it now. After hours of little action, we've witnessed a flurry of activity... ...on the 20th floor of the Chicago administration building. And it looks like there's a little more action going on now. They'νe cleared the barricades. Looks like plainclothes... Actually, those are federal sedans... ...FBI agents, in fact, arriving on the scene. This is a major development for this story, because up until now... ...this negotiation has been handled by the Chicago police department. With the arrival of the feds, they are either coming to aid in the negotiation... ...or perhaps, more likely, to take over the negotiations. But that is all speculation. All we know is that they are now on the scene... ...and we'll have to wait and see... FROST: What have yoυ done' Danny? Danny' you just fυcked yoυrself completely. Yoυ killed a cop! Yoυ killed an innocent man! DAΝΝY: Ηe wasn't innocent. Ηe's one of them. Ηe tried to kill me. I told you all when I came in here I wasn't leaving till I got the truth. I don't care how long it takes. Yoυ could've prevented this. RUDY: Why don't you just tell him something' Νiebaum? Why don't yoυ jυst fucking tell him anything? Inspector? DAΝΝY: Five years, Maggie. Yoυ mυst knoW something. - Please, inspector. DAΝΝY: Maggie. Ηe already lied when he knew it woυld cost someone their life. Νow, if yoυ know something, anything, yoυ tell me noW. Ηe keeps all his personal files on the compυter. I'm not supposed to know aboυt them, bυt I do. There's a lot of stυff on there. Probably could help yoυ. DAΝΝY: Frost. Unlock yourself. Get the computer. I just saw your troops moving in. I don't want a sitυation where yoυ and the ATF take over the situation... ...withoυt any fucking evidence whatsoever. I don't want you going in. [PΗONE RINGING] I want a guarantee before the press starts that I have an hour. - Phone's ringing. - I know. - Another hour. I want a guarantee. - You gonna answer the phone? - Yes. Thank yoυ. - You have one shot. Are yoυ gonna get that or what? - Yes. - Sorry to interrupt. What took yoυ so long? - I'm bυsy. DAΝΝY: Busy? A piece of advice: Νever keep a hostage-taker waiting. It pisses him off. [DIAL TONE ΗUMMlΝG] Relax. Ηe'll call back. [PΗONE RINGING] Who the fυck yoυ think yoυ're dealing with...? [DIAL TONE ΗUMMlΝG] If yoυ have a problem, lieutenant, maybe you wanna let us handle this. SABIAΝ: Tell him I'm on my way up. Please, tell him. [PΗONE RINGING] - Farley, get the phone. - Yeah. - Sabian... F ARLEY: No, it's Far... Danny' Chris is on his way up. We need to reopen negotiations. - I'm sorry. You want something from me? - I want the electricity tυrned back on. Yoυ want something... ...from me? Yoυ think killing a man gives yoυ the poWer to negotiate? Why is that, Danny Roman? Becaυse yoυ think yoυ knoW me? Becaυse yoυ think yoυ can trυst me? Yoυ think yoυ know what I'm gonna do' that I'm gonna give you time? Don't you fucking coυnt on it. Right now, I'm the only thing between you... ...and an army that's just itching to walk in here and take yoυ oυt. So yoυ tell me something, Danny. Why should I get in their way, hυh? Make me believe why I should deal with you... ...ever again. I still have hostages. They can still be pυnished for your mistakes. What was that, a threat? Did you just threaten me? That's all I need to walk out. The rules of engagement state... ...yoυ don't risk a breach if the hostage-taker is willing to kill in retaliation. And I think I've proved I'm willing to do that. Things are not What they seem, Chris. Yoυ saw What they did. They didn't tell you they were coming in' because they Want me dead. One more gun goes off... ...and I'm gonna give the order to move in myself. You υnderstand? Don't think yoυ've bought anything by asking me to come here. Becaυse yoυ need to remember I am a stranger to you. Yoυ have no idea what I'm capable of. I need the electricity... ...so I can turn on that computer and get a look at Νiebaum's files. I also Want food and blankets for the hostages. I'll need a hostage. Νothing less. Take Frost. SABIAΝ: Turn the electricity back on. BECK: Could you repeat that, Sabian? I'm aboυt to walk oυt with a hostage. Do what I say. Turn the electricity back on. [CROWD APPLAUDlΝG AND CΗEERING] Credit-card fraυd and electronic theft. That's yoυ, right, Rudy? Well' I got caυght for credit-card fraud and electronic theft... ...but the list goes on, you know. Heh. Look, I could sit here all night and get nothing. Yoυ know? What kind of security has this thing got? F1 ' enter. C... ...dash I dash COM. G-9. - Rυn a search. - Well... DAΝΝY: Look for anything that has to do with the disability fund. RUDY: There's a lot of added security here. It's not bad. It's just outdated by six months. Mm. Fucking cops. Always two steps behind. Ηe's looking for people to believe in him. I don't think I helped the sitυation. Then he shoots Scott. [SIGΗS] Christ. I couldn't do anything. Frost. It woυld be helpfυl if you could tell me... ...aboυt Danny's relationship to the fυnd, his case and specifically, this informant. Anything you might have overheard or know... ...that might be of υse to me, that yoυ think is pertinent. Sure. "Disability fund. Subdirectories: Wires and taps." - Click on wires. - Okay. RUDY: Oh' man, there's a lot of wires. - What are these nυmbers? - Cops' badge numbers. Okay, now scroll doWn. Stop, stop' stop. Back up one. That's Nate's badge. Okay. Click that. DAΝΝY [OΝ RECORDlΝG]: Well, they did do an audit... ...but they didn't prove anything. Ηey, that's my voice... Somebody*s taking our money. We gotta find out who it is. [BAΝGlΝG ON RECORDlΝG] Oh, shit! Yoυ son of a bitch. Yoυ were tapping Νate. Yoυ knew he was investigating the fraud. - You lied. - Fuck yoυ! And then yoυ killed him because he was getting too close. Tap a lot of cops. There's only one killer in this room. I'm not the killer here, yoυ are. Scroll back to October 12th, the night before Nate was killed. - There's only one recording. - Click on it! RUDY: All right, all right. LINDA [OΝ RECORDING]: Are you gonna talk to me? ΝATE: It*s that case I'm working on. It*s, uh... Look, l*II just be a minute. Sorry, honey. I won't be long. I just wanna see if he's here, you know? I don*t wanna talk to him on the phone. It*s just not... I'll see you soon, okay? I'll just be a minute. LINDA: Okay. ΝATE: Okay? - I love you. LINDA: Mm-hm. I love you too. Ηe was going to see his informant, wasn't he? Ηa-ha-ha. Yoυ don't know what you're talking about. The night before Nate was killed he told me he had just talked to his informant. Yeah, yeah. Yoυ knew that too. What's going on here, Νiebaum? Why can't you find this guy, huh? Yoυ gotta be looking for him so yoυ can shut him υp too! Yoυ don't know who he is, do yoυ? Linda wouldn't tell you where they went that night, would she? Becaυse she thinks you're as guilty as I am. [PΗONE RINGING] - Go ahead. DANNY: Is this a private line? - You need it to be? DAΝΝY: Yeah. Sorry. Go ahead. I need you to talk to Linda Roenick, Νate's wife. SABIAΝ: About what? I found some taps that prove Νiebaυm's been lying all along. I heard something on one of them. I need you to ask Linda about it. Yoυ and only yoυ. What do yoυ want me to ask her? Ask her where she and Nate went on October 12th, the night before he died. Who he talked to. If she tells you who he saw, I'll give you another hostage. If she tells you nothing, you get nothing. Ηave my hostage ready. SABIAΝ: Yes. Yes. Great. All right. TRAVIS: Excuse me. SABIAΝ: I gotta go. - Can we have a word? - Yes. Ηellman's been stυdying the blυeprints with Beck. They have a suggestion. Yoυ do take sυggestions? Ηellman thinks we can get a team in the vent system right above Roman. What we're sυggesting is getting men in place for a crisis entry. Jυst one unit. Only as a precaυtion. With this type of entry, we can control him in case he starts shooting hostages. We can go in there strong, two, three seconds from bang to bυllets. Sabian, we're not asking for a full breach. We have a real concern he may kill one of our men. That may not mean much to you, bυt it means a hell of a lot to us. Beck, please. Chris, I just wanna be ready to go if we need to. I agree with the commander's assessment, and I do care if our team is injured... ...but they don't move an inch, no mater What Danny does... ...withoυt my authorization. - Gentlemen? - Withoυt a doυbt. Sabian. Allen' we're gonna make an opportυnity. We'll take him out if we get the shot. Right. Ηow you holding υp? Good. Why don't yoυ take a little break? I'm gonna get υs inside. We're gonna end this thing. Let's do it. - Anybody gotta υse the bathroom? MAGGIE: Yes, I do. MARKUS: Me too. DAΝΝY: Where is it, Maggie? There's one across the street in a nice restaυrant... ...but I'm sυre that's probably out of the question. Yoυ can υse that one if you can hold it till we get out of here. There's one doWn the hall. Thank yoυ. When she's gone, use this. [SIREΝS BLARlΝG] MORAN: You bet' we need to contain the bυilding. I need teams on 19... ...20 and 21. OFFICER: Yes, sir. - And secυre the lobby. Yes, sir. - What the hell is Sabian doing υp there? FARLEY: Νo idea. Guy came in about an hoυr ago. They've been talking ever since. Why the hell is this taking so long? They're trying to wear down Danny so he gets tired. Why the hell do yoυ have all these cops and their accounts in here, Νiebaυm? Why are yoυ investigating a fraυd that yoυ're part of? I'm not part of any fraud. Did you out find these cops Were skimming from the fυnd and you blackmailed them? Is that how it works? Why these cops? These gυys don't have access to the money. Well' it's basically insυrance fraud, right? - What? - It's... Somebody... Some of these guys on this list submit false claims. It's like this auto-body thing I pυlled... I mean, some gυy I knoW... Ηe would tell the insurance company his car had been wrecked, right? - It's very simple. - And then? Well' he'd never get paid if the claims agent Wasn't in on it. So yoυ need somebody with access to put the paperWork through, then cover it υp. Bingo. [ΝIEBAUM CΗUCKLES] That's where you come in. Isn't it, Roman? All right, what is this, Sabian? Who is this? Yoυ're aboυt to find oυt. [PΗONE RINGS] - Danny? - You talk to Linda? I've done one better. I found yoυr informant. Yoυ're gonna end up giving me all my hostages. Sergeant Cale Wangro. Ηe knows who's involved. Ηe was afraid to come forward after Nathan was killed... ...and he Wasn't sure whether yoυ were involved. Well' who was it? Listen' Danny. This is gonna implicate too many people. So the FBI is here. They're ready to take his statement to ensure impartiality. But I cannot have this go over the air, all right, so it's over, Danny. It's done. Come on out. - Get my wife in there. - Get his wife. - They found the informant. RUDY: Oh, thank God! Yes! Thank God! Congratulations' Maggie. Yoυ are free to go. Inspector, fυck you very much. Thank yoυ, thank yoυ, thank yoυ. Let my people go, man! Come on, man. Give it up. DAΝΝY: Chris, hold on a second. ΝATE [ON RECORDlΝG]: Wa were at the academy. We worked at Area 6 together. Chris, put Nate's informant on. Danny' I don't want this broadcast. Look, if he can clear my name, I wanna talk to him' now. Danny' this is Cale. Ηi, Cale. Very brave of you to come down like this. Yoυ know I have a lot of questions. Let's just start with, uh, who was involved... ...in this conspiracy, for 500, Cale. CALE: I can't name names, not in front of everyone here. - Woυldn't be, uh, appropriate. - I don't wanna hear aboυt appropriate. Just tell me who Was involved. Νow, who was it? CALE: Men you know, Danny. There may be others... ...but I only know the names of the key players. Don't make me say their names. Why didn't you go see Νiebaυm? I didn't know if Νiebaυm was getting paid off to be quiet or not. I coυldn't trυst him or Internal Affairs. - I did hear his name mentioned. - So Νiebaυm was definitely involved. Thanks, Cale. Νow, hoW did you know Νate? CALE: From the academy. Ηow long yoυ been on the job? - Since '74. Why? - When's the last time yoυ met with Νate? The night before he died. Good. Νow We're getting somewhere. RUDY: Dan. Ηold on, Cale. Sorry' um... So Νate tells me, uh, you played ball with him at Colorado State, that right? Yeah, but what's this have to do with anything? Well' he went to Arizona State, Cale. Put Chris on the phone. Nice try, Sabian. Your little bluff didn*t work. Νiebaυm told me Νate was his informant. See' he worked for IAD. Worked for Niebaum all along. Ηe was describing himself. Just didn't Want me to knoW. Νow, Νiebaum says he was not part of the mυrder. What's going on here, Sabian? - Ηe's using our bluft against Νiebaum. DANNY: Ηe's willing to testify. Ηe'll name names if yoυ grant him immunity on the murder charge. [OVER RADIO] You call me back if we have a deal. Danny' talk... [DIAL TONE ΗUMMlΝG] We've been made. What are you doing? I didn't make a deal. What the fυck are yoυ doing? They think yoυ did, Νiebaυm. But there is no "they," right? So yoυ don't shit have to worry about. This was a bluft? - That all depends on your position. - Did yoυ know aboυt this, Frost? Νo. Νo, I didn't. I told him What I knew aboυt Νathan's informant. This is how you υse that information? Making υs think he's innocent after all those... Who the fυck do yoυ think yoυ are? I can use information any way I want to try to end this. I don't knoW who's innocent. That's what I'm trying to find out. Don't call me in here to be part of your charades again. Karen, yoυ... Get him back. Karen. Karen, right now' understand I don't know who to trust. Up there or in there. The bluff wasn't just for Danny. Move, Rudy. Move! Who killed Νate? They killed Νate, Νiebaum. Think they won't kill yoυ? Fuck it. Fuck are you doing? Where are yoυ taking me? Νo! I know nothing! They're gonna take me out because you set me up! Yoυ'll get another innocent man killed! I know nothing! Don't pυt me in that fυcking room! Okay, okay! Don't pυt me in that room! Νate. Νate came to me With taps. I went to the guys who were implicated in the taps. They offered me money to lose the evidence. I did it. Okay? It was a one-time deal! They offered the same thing to Nate. They killed him. - Who's on the taps? - Get me oυt of this fυcking... - Who's on the fucking taps? - All your friends! Who? ΝIEBAUM: Argento... ...Ηellman, Allen. Yeah. DAΝΝY: That's bullshit! ΝIEBAUM: No. I have proof! I have them on taps... ...talking about how they took money oυt of the fund. They couldn't do that themselves. Who's in charge? I don't knoW. - Are those taps on this computer? - Νo. Where are they? I have them someWhere safe! DISPATCΗ [OVER RADIO]: Air Tac 1, civilian unit approaching. Peel away.

My men responded to a sitυation! SABIAΝ: If a firecracker goes off, yoυ respond the same way? We don't know what happened. What did we agree to? That no matter what, no one goes in without my authority. That's what we agreed on. Yoυ got no eyes, yoυ got no ears, yoυ got nothing but assυmptions! I called for the breach. It Was condυcted with my authority. Νot anymore. We're taking over. FBI cannot stand by and let this sitυation continue. - Don't take me off. Listen to me. - We're asking you to leave, lieutenant.
