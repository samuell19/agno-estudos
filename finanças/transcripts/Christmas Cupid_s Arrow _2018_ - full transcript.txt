(gentle music) (dramatic music) (ethereal music) (bright music) - Excited. - Oh, I can start watching cartoons again. - Oh, my God. Happy Thanksgiving, people. Eat. - Where's the turkey? - I told you my parents are vegan. - Oh, yeah, you're gonna love it. - Look, it looks great, thanks. - Oh, it is. Don't ask, honey, just eat. (family laughs) - All right. - Good (laughs). - Here we go again, Thanksgiving. - Oh, I am just stuffed. - It was great. - I know, this was just so good. I don't think I can eat any-- - I think I need a nap (laughs). - I know. Thank you so much for hosting. - So, I uh, I have really great news. - What? - I finally got published. - Oh, why, Holly, we are so proud of you. - That's right. - I know how hard you've worked. - I know. - Oh. Excellent, Holly, it's wonderful. I'm so glad. - Thank you, Daddy. - Where can I read it? - "The Black Hills Literary Journal," it's an academic paper. - "Black Hills," that is very prestigious. It's pure Ivy League. It's a major accomplishment, baby. - Thank you. - Which article? - Oh, "Art of Deception: The False Narrator "in Mid-20th Century Novels." - I remember it, yeah. - Well, you must have made good money on it. - Um, just a couple, couple hundred bucks, but that's not really what it's about-- - A couple hundred? - I told you, honey, my sis is an English professor, Dr. Willinger. Remember? - Of course. - It really is good for my career, because once you're published-- - We're pregnant. - Oh my God. Oh my God. - Wait, what? (Mrs. Willinger squeals) Oh God, thank you. - I'm gonna be a grandma? - Yeah. - Finally? I'm thrilled. - Right. - Baby sis, I am so happy for you. - [Mrs. Willinger] How far along? I just-- - Seven weeks. I mean, I literally just found out-- - Your mother threw up every minute of every day. - I did. I was horribly sick. Wasn't I, sweetheart? - First couple of months. - Things to look forward to. - But that's not gonna happen to you. - Yeah. - You're gonna be so, oh, you're already glowing. (dramatic music) - Gosh, Auntie Holly. (gasps) You're gonna have to get used to that. - Guess I should get her a gift. - Maybe a card. Dear Carol, you've one-upped me for the last time. Love and daggers, Holly. - (chuckles) Stop. - It's true, though. What more could she do? - You know, it's weird. While everybody was hugging and celebrating, all I could think was, what have I done in the last five years? I spent all of my 20s obsessing over dead authors, while everybody around me was having babies and giving life, real life. - Uh, hi. Not everybody has kids. I don't have kids. - Yeah, but you're married. - Yeah, there's that. - I don't even have a-- - Boyfriend? Yeah, that's not exactly a secret. Believe me. - All just friends. - Well, we're gonna fix it, come on. - [Holly] So how did you meet Sean? - It was that dating app, you know, Cupid's Arrow. Oh come on, it's how people meet these days. It's actually scary accurate. It's by one of the Facebook engineer, that did it. - Ah. - Oh look at you. You don't believe me? All right. - Hey! - What, you don't trust me? I even know your pin code, come on. (phone clicking) Cupid's Arrow is on your phone. - Oh (chuckles). - Use it. Please use it. - I'm not going to use it. - [Emily] You're gonna use it. I command you to use it. (dramatic music) (phone clicks) - Woo! - Oh, hello. - What are you doing, Holly? Ooh. - No! - Holly, what are you even trying to say with this? - Oh come on, don't be mean. - This is absurd. Really? - Don't lie, be truthful. - It's you. I don't need to lie. Okay. Smile. - No. (phone clicking) - I took like five. - Okay. - Is that one good? Yeah. - Oh, yeah! - Okay? - It's kinda good. - Okay, trust me. - Okay. - Now all we have to do is wait. (dramatic music) - Do you mind if I order the Steak Vesuvio? - No, why would I mind? - It's $27. - Okay. - Well, you're a college professor. I just wanted to make sure you could afford it. - Mm, mm. What do you get when you cross the engine from a '67 Harley, Ducati forks, and carbon fiber? - I don't know. (fist bangs) - Perfection! Perfection in motorcycle form. I'll show you later. (solemn music) - And that's why I think Charles Dickens created one of the greatest Christmas literature pieces ever. I mean, Scrooge's story alone, it gives hope. It gives possibility that somebody can turn their lives around and be kind again and open up their heart, become a better person. - Yeah (laughs). (phone chimes) - Hey, honey. Yeah. - Well, I work mostly out of my van. Actually outside. - Is it? - Would you like to see it? - Uh, no, not yet. - You know, you haven't touched your muffin. - I'm not hungry. - Can I have it? - Well, I'll meet y'all there. Is Pastor Phil gonna be there? His wife too? Okay, okay. - "From Dusk till Dawn," Clooney, in that film, oh my God, he's amazing. That's exactly what I wanna be like. - They're behind the dryer, and I put Jimmy's socks on the ottoman. - I've dated a lot of Asian girls in the past. Thank you. - Can I have the check, please? (somber music) (Holly sighs) (phone chimes) (Holly sighs) ("Twelve Days of Christmas") I'm oh for three. I'm out. - You can't be out. You've hardly given it any time at all. It's a very good app. It had very good reviews, and it uses algorithms. - Do you even know what that means? - Yes, I'm a maths teacher. I'm not a great one, but I am one. Okay, so hopefully, this place has some, right, because he mentioned that he used to play the violin, and that is before I knew him. - Okay, why don't you just get him something he can't buy? - Because I suggested dancing, and he said no. - Sean's a great guy. You're lucky. We'll figure it out, let's go inside. - Oh yeah, it's really cold. ("Twelve Days of Christmas") (Emily sighs) There. Okay, what are we thinking? I like this one. Do you like this one? Holly, what are you doing? - I'm deleting my profile. - No, you're not. Okay. How difficult can it be to find an attractive, 30-something man, no kids, single, over six feet tall? - Look, I would settle for breathing, unmarried, with a brain and a heart. - (laughs) Is it really that bad? - Yeah, you didn't see those guys. - Good grief. (phone chimes) Okay. Okay, hello, here is one. And, uh, his name is literally Mr. Wright. - Hm. Well, I mean, he might be too pretty. - Who says something like that? Nobody is too pretty. Okay. Now he knows you're interested. (Emily gasps) It'll do. We're good. (bright music) - Whoa, let me help you out there. Could you tell me where the admin office is? - Yeah, just gimme a second. - Oh. - A bit of a mess here. - Here, let me help. - Thank you. You're a professor. - Oh, it shows, huh? I'm an attorney, a litigator. - Oh, so you sue people. - I get people what they deserve. But, don't worry, I'm one of the good ones. - (laughs) Follow me. - So, what do you teach here? - Well, how do you know I'm a professor? - Lucky guess. - Okay, guess which department. - Not math. You're far too attractive to be a math teacher. - You should see our math department. - And with coffee and donuts, too kind for chemistry. Have you ever met a chemistry teacher who wasn't angry? - I'm sure I have (laughs). - I'm gonna go with psychology. - How did you know that? - I'm a really good litigator. And I may have peeked inside your bag. - Cheater. (both laugh) Well, this is you. Beware, Mrs. Gunderman, you have to get past her, and she eats litigators for breakfast. - Ah, well, thanks for the help and the tip. - I'm Erin Rafferty. - Wright, Josh Wright. - (laughs) Okay. - Oh, don't forget these. Otherwise, your students will all transfer to your rival, Southern Edge. - We can't have that. - Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find a David Martin? - He's in class for the next 10 minutes. You can wait for him in his office, but I need to see your student ID. - Oh, uh, it's been a while since I've had a student ID, uh, Mrs. Gunderman, is it? I'm an old friend. I'm trying to surprise him. What do you say? - (squeaks) Room 208, and you didn't talk to me. Now go before I change my mind. (bright music) (Mrs. Gunderman giggles) - Hi, Molls. Yes, honey, I'm sure Santa's gonna find our house this year. Honey, I know the delivery guy sometimes has a hard time finding our house, but Santa will, I promise. Sweetheart, I told you already, it doesn't matter that we don't have a chimney on our roof anymore. All right, I love you, too. Bye. (gentle music) Oh, come on, are you serious? - Shh. - Sorry. Sorry, guys, sorry. (gentle music) - David. - Josh. How long has it been, man? - Ah, it's great to see you. - Shh. - Sorry, sorry, guys, sorry, sorry. The walls are very thin here. It's great to see you. What are you, what are you doing here? Sit down. - I'm here to crush Kappa Rho. - The fraternity, I thought they already got suspended. - They did, and now they're suing the school for suspending them. I represent the school. I just closed a case like this over at Southern Edge University, had a big win, boom, killed it. - Wow, that's great, I think. - And now I'm here, same thing. - And you're still at-- - Cole, Cusper, and Wright. - And Wright? Oh, you're a partner now? - Yeah (laughs), yeah. So, I'll buy you dinner. You choose the restaurant. Let's go. - I can't. I actually need notice for a babysitter, 'cause I got Molly. But how long you here for? - Hmm, Christmas, give or take. - Okay. - Wow, you are a real rock star, huh? - I think the tenure committee would disagree. - [Josh] How old is Molly now? - She's six. (Josh laughs) - [Josh] And how is the novel? - It's on hold. You know, since Nancy passed away, I've just been either busy with Molly or teaching or publishing an article. So it's been hard to get something started. - Publish or perish, huh? - Mm-hmm. - Is that for real or just something people say about professors? - No, that's a real thing, but I really don't mind, because any writing is better than no writing. - Hey, I'm really sorry for missing Nancy's service. I was out of the country. - It's all right. You shouldn't worry about it. Um, I gotta go. Will you walk me to the car? Are you still single? - Yup. - Do you like being single? - My New Year' resolution is to settle down, next year. - That sounds about right. - Well, it isn't all bad. - Let me just clear off a space real quick. - No worries, I'm right over here. (car chirps) - Nice. - Hey, remember that case I was just talking to you about? - Uh, boom, you killed it? - (chuckles) Yeah, yeah, that one. I got some real juice over at Southern Edge. They love me, and they're looking for someone who can edit and contribute to their journals. They're big-time, right? - Yes. - Throw your hat in the ring. Let me work my magic. You are perfect for them, and it's gotta be better than this. Focus on what you love doing, the writing, get a better school for Molly, make some actual money. - I don't know. - Think about it. Anyway, let's catch up. You choose that restaurant. I'm buying. - Let's do it. It's good to see you. - You too. (dog barking) - Oh, honey, no, I can't. I can't do this right now, honey. I got too much work to do. - What's a date? - A what? - A date. - Where did you hear that from? - Grandma. - Oh. Molly, come out here, I wanna talk to you. Okay, um, a date is when two grown-ups go out and they have fun together. - Like the zoo? - Yes. - Or the movies? - Yeah, or they go to a restaurant. - Do you go on dates? - Uh, no, I don't go on dates right now. - Why not? - Because I already have a pretty lady in my life. That's right, it's you. Come here. - [Molly] I love you, Daddy. - Oh, I love you, honey. (lips smacking) (somber music) (phone chimes) (Holly laughs) (gentle music) (David coughs) - Just us? - Oh, jeez! - I wasn't, I, I, um-- - I, I know. I just didn't see you. - Sorry about that. - I'm Holly Willinger. - David Martin. - Nice to meet you. - Oh, we're actually in the same department, 'cause, like, my office is by the library. They got me kinda exiled to Siberia over there. Looks like we're it, huh? - Yeah. - Here. - Do you have any idea what we're supposed to be doing? - I have a list. - Great. - It's in here, yup. - You wanna sit? Lovely. Do you want to pull up a chair? - Yeah, yeah, I should probably. I gotta put my bag somewhere, though, right? Not in the-- - Thank you. - Oh, sorry. I'll put-- - Yeah (laughs). - You know, I'm just gonna put it back, the other way. - Okay. - So, my vote is to have it be formal but not black tie, 'cause that way women don't feel forced into wearing long gowns. It's kind of fun to wear something short. - Yeah, I, I, I would always err on the side of wearing something shorter as opposed to longer. - Yeah (laughs). Well, I guess, though, it matters most where we have it, because if it's more casual of a venue, doesn't it always happen at the Mulberry? - It does, but I thought we could change it up and just do something new. There's, uh, this Italian restaurant that's new. And I heard it's really great. It's called Ivo's. Have you heard of that? - I have. It sounds pricey, though. - Oh. - I don't know if we have it in our budget. - Okay. Um, I could go get a price from them. It wouldn't be hard, and then let you know. - I'm just curious. Why not just stick with Mulberry's? - Same old, same old kind of thing, wanted to do something new, but I will, I'll get in contact with them. - Okay. - I'll send that. - Music, my favorite. - Oh, uh, my cousin Nichole is a deejay. - That's cool. - Yeah. Anyways, I thought she could do it. - Yeah, or we could just get an iPod and put Christmas music on shuffle. - Yeah, I thought of that, but my worry is that like a bad stretch of Christmas music starts, and then we don't know when it ends, if you have an iPod. - Tell me one bad Christmas song. - "Simply Having a Wonderful Christmas" by Paul McCartney is the worst song ever. - Oh, okay, first of all, Sir Paul McCartney. - Oh, well, that's, you know-- - And he gets a pass. He wrote "Yesterday". All sins are forgiven. - No, he didn't. John wrote "Yesterday." No. - Yes. - What planet are you on? - The planet that the Beatles-- - It is Paul. It is Paul. - Oh, all right, well-- - It is Paul, and I feel so sad that you don't know that. - We're gonna have to agree to disagree. - I guess so. - Even though I'm right. - (laughs) Okay. - But, um... - I'm down. All right, decor. - We could do classic black and white. - Hmm? Yeah, no, we need to have like some green and red. It's Christmas, right? - Right, you're right. Do, like, red balloons and spread 'em across the room. - Only if we get to dress up Pennywise as a Santa Claus. - I'm sorry, did you just make an "It" reference? - Yeah, I've seen the movie. - Oh, okay, did you read the book? - Yeah, when I was a kid. You? - Yeah, I read a couple of his books. - Which ones? - Oh, let me think, all of them, twice. (Holly laughs) What? - He is the reason that I read as a child. - Yeah. - He was my everything. - Yes, me, too. - Obsessed with him. - Totally, totally, well, your secret's safe with me. - That's wild. Thank you. Your secret's safe with me, too. Oh, I gotta go. - Oh, okay. Okay, yeah. - Here's our list of your quotes that you need to get. Thanks. - Yes. - I will see you later. - Thank you. And, uh, drive safe. - Good meeting. - Good meeting, great meeting, the best meeting. - Bye. (laughs) Okay, bye. - Okay. (Holly coughs) Drive safe, again. (door clacks) Oh my God. (David scoffs) (customers chattering) (gentle music) - I am, ooh, so sorry that I'm late. - No worries. - Ooh, it's chilly out there. Oh, is this for me? - Yeah, cardamom with honey, right? - How did you... Right, the profile. - So, as a litigator your job is, hmm, it's a little ruthless, right? You need to go after people, file lawsuits? - You know, I actually set out to be a public defender. - Really? What happened? - I figured out pretty quickly that I would be paying student loans until I was 80. - (chuckles) Come on. - Well, almost 80. - I have to admit, I am still paying mine, and it feels like it's never-ending. - So, why literature? - Um, because I love it (chuckles). There's really no greater reason. - What do you love about it? - Well, Mr. Litigator, you use language in your job, every day. You use it to persuade, convince, win your argument, right? - I guess, yeah. - That's how you use words. A writer of literature uses language for a different reason, to, to share with the rest of us an experience that they've had. When it works, it is magic. You get to see things you've never seen and feel things that you've never felt. You get a new perspective on the world. It's like you grow as a human. When I have a moment like that, I have to admit it makes my spirit soar. - I love your teeth. - My teeth? - (chuckles) Is that weird? - Yeah. (both laugh) So, uh, what's the last novel that you read? - Um, I haven't read a novel in a while. - So what do you read? - Witness interviews, depositions, investigative reports, tons of discovery, and then I have to go and read any case that has bearing. Case authority is what we call it. Motions, filings, briefs, other boring things like that. - No, no, just different. (phone dings) - We have the same phone. - See, we have something in common. - Yeah (laughs). Fair enough. (controller clicking) - [Emily] Sean? Sean. Sean. - Hey! - Hi. - I just got these. They sound great. They sound, what? - That's great. Holly hasn't called me back yet. - Don't get involved. - [Emily] But it's their first date. - Don't get involved. - Where do you think he's taking her? Do you think he took her dancing? You used to take me dancing. - Can this wait until I finish this level, please, please? (phone chimes) (Emily gasps) - Finally, well? - Mm, I suppose he was intelligent, just not-- - Funny? - Oh, I, I guess I laughed, a little. - Okay, was he romantic with you? - It was a coffee date. - Okay, was he charming? - Yeah. Yeah, but, but something was off. When I (laughs), he asked me why literature, and when I tried to explain it to him, it was like trying to explain quantum physics to a two-year-old. He complimented my (gasps) teeth. My teeth! - No, he did not. - Not my eyes, my teeth. - Your teeth? But you (laughs), but you hate your teeth. - I hate my teeth. - Uh, okay, so I have a theory. I think the teeth thing is very weird, but I believe that this guy is beautiful enough and that you should give him another shot. - I don't know, dear. My gut is telling me-- - Sean. Tell Holly he's beautiful. Tell, just tell her. - He's beautiful, Holly. - Thanks, Sean. - That's committed, thank you. So that sounded like he didn't mean it, but I believe he did, and I think this guy is, like, hot enough, like, he's stunning, and that you should give him another chance. - Okay, maybe, I will, maybe. - [Emily] I feel like you should say yes before I hang up. - If it'll get you to stop, then yes. - It would. Thank you. I love you, bye. Say yes. - Yes. - Do you even know what I'm saying? - Huh? - Good God! - I love you. (customers chattering) - I woke you up, didn't I? I'm sorry. I just wanted to talk. I hope you don't mind. - No, it's fine. (coughs) Miss! Hi, uh, black coffee, decaf. Thank you. (sighs) I got your message. It kinda seemed like an emergency, so my mom's watching my kid. You all right? - Are you dating anyone, anyone special in your life? - Am, am I? (laughs) Josh, I haven't heard from you in years. You, you called me with a panicky message but you, you want to know about my love life. Thank you. - Hey, man, I'm sorry. I know it's been a long time since we talked, but I just thought this would be a good opportunity to catch up. So, is there anyone special in your life? - There is a woman at work who doesn't know I exist. She really lights up the room. - Oh, that's good. You're a writer, yeah, a literary writer? - Allegedly, yeah. - There's this girl. Okay, she's smart, but we don't seem to be connecting. - That doesn't happen very often to you, does it? - (scoffs) Exactly, yeah. I talk to women all the time. It works fine, but not with this one. She's, she's different. She says I'm a litigator so I use language to convince and persuade, and apparently, that doesn't do it for her. No, she prefers language that uplifts and enlightens about our shared experiences or some BS like that. - You know, I'd argue that that's not BS, but I hear you. What, what, what can I do? - I need something that (sighs), how did she put it, something that makes you see what you didn't see, feel what you didn't feel. I need help delivering that. - Has it ever occurred to you that you guys aren't a good match? - No. Look, a jump start, that's all I need. - Well, I don't know. I could write her a poem from you. - Yeah, that's a great start. - No, I was just kidding, right there. I actually couldn't do that. That's very manipulative. - Oh, come on, man. I just need you to get the pump primed for me. When you write it, think about this mystery woman of yours for inspiration. Later, I can, I can do it myself. - Well, there is this poem I've been working on, worked on it this afternoon. - That's great. Send it over. - Hmm, you know what, I don't know. That's weird. - Hey, uh, remember that position at Southern Edge? It's still open. I confirmed it. Now my recommendation would put you at the top of that list, if not seal it. And not only would you be writing, but you'd have more time to spend with Molly, get her into a better school and maybe even buy guesthouse for your mom. - All right, listen, you and I go way back. I'll write you the poem. But, but don't tell me anything about her, 'cause that would make it less truthful. I also want you to think about what happens when the poems stop coming, and she starts asking questions, because women are much more intuitive than men, Josh. (sighs) I don't think this is going to end very well. - You let me worry about how it ends. I just need your help gettin' started. - Cheers. (gentle music) - [Mickey] No, that is ridiculous. - You're up late. - It's okay. Molly's asleep in her room. The, uh, landlord called. - Um, I'll call her in the morning. - (scoffs) How can you say such stupid things? - [David] What? - Not you, this guy, complete nutjob. (gasps) S.T.F.U. - Mom! (Mickey scoffs) - What is Hemingway trying to say about the dishonor of modern warfare and the protagonist's imminent doom during the bloody Spanish Civil War? Anyone? Oh, come on, guys, even Metallica wrote a song about it. - I know Metallica. Lost in Vegas reacted to one of their songs. You don't know Lost in Vegas? They're pretty cool. - That's time. I want you guys to look up the song, by Metallica, "For Whom the Bell Tolls". I want 500 words on how it does or does not relate to the themes in Hemingway's novel. And I want it for Thursday. It will be graded. (students chattering) (bright music) - Yeah? Oh, hey. - Hey. - Ooh, what's happening? - Listen to this. - [Emily] What? - "She is sunlight on my cave of ice. "She is a mystery. "She is fire, "piercing eyes and an ancient soul. "She awakens me. "She challenges me. "Something stirs. "I grow." - Ooh. - Uh-huh. - Who, Josh? - [Holly] That's his name at the end. - Wow. - I-- - "Piercing eyes and an ancient soul." That is, that is impressive. And I'm jealous. That's what just happened. (Holly laughs) Take it away. - No, but for real, I honestly cannot believe that the same guy I had coffee with wrote this. - It seems like a different person, and I can't believe that I can't find a Christmas present for my own husband. - Why are you stressing out so much about this? - Sean and I are officially in couple's therapy. - (sighs) I'm sorry, honey, I didn't know. (Emily groans) Is it working? - Honestly, I have no idea. - That bad, huh? - Possibly. - Hey, come here. Come here. It's gonna be okay. It will. - Hey, your office hours start in like two minutes, right? - Yes, they do. (solemn music) - Shadows stretch yields before the blue sky. It retreats. Light spills over the edge of her eyes. Her words ease the burden, and I let go. Her embrace steadies me. And it gives me, it gives me, it gives me-- - Hey. - Hey, hi, hello. Hi. - Hi. (both laugh) So sorry. Were you, were you performing? - I was doing a writing exercise. - [Holly] Oh. - Did you, did you hear that? - Ah, yeah, just a little. No, it was really good. - Well, thank you. Uh, uh, what's up? What's up with you? - I just came by to let you know that I am free tomorrow for our meeting. - Great, then I'll see you tomorrow, and I see you now too, but tomorrow, I'll see you too. - Yeah. - Yeah. (Holly laughs) (bright music) - Thank you for what you wrote to me. It was really nice. I liked it. - You did? I'm glad. - So it seems you are a writer. - Oh, I am not. I just, you inspired me. (Holly laughs) - Stop. - I'm serious. - Well, it was beautiful. So how are things going with your case? - I think we have the upper hand, but we're still in the discovery phase. We won't know for sure what we've got until that's complete. We had this one deposition yesterday where, I can't really talk about it. - (laughs) Good at keeping secrets, huh? - What do you mean? - Occupational hazard. - Oh (laughs), right. I'm sorry. So what are you working on? - Oh, just the Christmas formal. - Oh, what's that? - It's an end-of-the-year event for faculty. I'm setting it up. - Well, that sounds nice. - Yeah. You could come if you like. We could go together. - That sounds great. I would love to. (gentle music) - Great (chuckles). - [Molly] Look, Daddy, I'm beautiful. - Yes, you are, honey. Is that grandma's makeup? - Maybe. - Okay, where's grandma? - She's yelling at her iPad. - Oh, okay. - Oh, who's that? - This is Dr. Willinger. - Is she a real doctor, or a doctor like you? - We're both real doctors, silly. - (laughs) Hi, Molly. - Are you and my dad going on a date? (both laugh) - No, we're, we are working together. - All right, Molly, go find Grandma, please. - Okay, love you, Daddy. - I love you, too, kiddo. - God, she is so cute. - Yes, thank you. - Your mom lives with you, too? - She has for the last couple years. - That's, that's nice. - Yeah. - Look, I hate to be rushing us, but I have a class in 10 minutes. - Oh. - Where'd we leave off? - I heard from Ivo's. That's their quote. What do you think? - Wow, that's a really good price. - Yeah. - Would you mind if I go check it out before we commit? - No, of course, and also I wanted to tell you, you'll be happy to know, my cousin Nicole is booked that evening, so she's unavailable. - That's really funny, because you actually had me come around on the idea of a DJ. - Really? I could find another deejay. - No, I don't want to over-complicate things. Just, we're good with the playlist. - Okay. - Do you know who you're going with yet? - Oh, to the party? Uh, I hadn't thought of anybody. I mean, the only woman I can think of has a bedtime of 7 p.m. (Holly chuckles) - Hey, so, we have to go to the supply store and get some party stuff. - Definitely, we have to. It's a date. - Oh, yeah, it's a date, sure. Um, uh, you want to go, you want to go tomorrow? - I can't do tomorrow but text me. We'll work it out. - Oh, oh, okay. - Good job. - Thanks. - I'm excited about this restaurant. - Yeah, me too, good job to you too. - (laughs) All right. - It's gonna be, gonna be a great party. - I think these speakers are perfect for him, though. He really doesn't like the way the TV sounds. Oh, he's here, have fun tonight, bye. - Ah! - Hey. - Hey, you gotta hear these. - What are those? - Check 'em out. What? - Nothing. Those aren't the same clothes you were wearing earlier. - Yeah, I changed at the gym. - When did you start going to the gym? - Last week. You okay? - Yeah. I'm taking a bath. - Do you want me to-- - No. (packaging crinkling) (customers chattering) - Thank you. Could I ask you a question? - Of course. - Where did piercing eyes and ancient soul come from? (Josh chuckles) - Well, I don't know. I told you. You just inspired me. - I mean, I can write academic papers and analytical essays all day long, but that kind of, that kind of thing, that poetic writing, where an idea and an image just explode, (Josh sighs) where does that come from for you? How do you do it? - I just grab a pen, and it, uh... What? Now? - Sure. - I, I don't even have a, uh, uh, uh, a pen, great. (sighs) Honestly, I write better with the keyboard. - Well, there's a keyboard on your phone. I don't mean to put you on the spot. I just, I want to see your mind at work. That kind of creativity is, I find it fascinating. I want to know your process. What goes through your head? (Josh sighs) - I'll be honest. This, it just isn't my process. - Well, use that then. I want to hear your internal monologue as you're finding the words. - Internal monologue? I just don't really work that way, though. I mean, writing is a, it's a solitary thing. It's, it's not a performance skill. - Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry (laughs). - Can I see? (Josh laughs) (laughs) You're kidding, right? - What, what? - You're telling me that he wrote you the lyrics to "Stairway to Heaven"? - (laughs) I like him. - Shut up, Sean. - I feel terrible. I mean, I pressured him. He told me that he didn't like to write in front of other people, which is, you know, it's completely, it makes sense. - Okay. Okay, well, Mozart wrote some of the best music the world's ever heard, and he couldn't hold a conversation. (bell dings) - You know who else makes good cookies? Grandma, and she's headed home now. - So was Mom. - Yeah. Ah, lifesaver. I gotta run. - Oh. I got your suit pressed, in case you need it. What on earth happened here? - Daddy made the lumpiest cookies ever. - (laughs) Lumpy cookies for his little monkey. - Oh, that's good. - Thanks. (phone beeps) (phone dings) - Hold on. - Ooh, ooh, is that a text? Was that him? - Yeah. - [Emily] What did he say, what did he say? What did he say? - Oh my God. He wrote me the sweetest goodnight text ever. - Aww. - So where do you come up with this stuff? - I'm a writer. You know, I create. It's what I do. - Is this about that mystery woman? - Kinda. She's amazing. - The first since Nancy? - Maybe the first time, half the time, 0.5. I think about her all the time. She doesn't know I exist. - Well, why not tell her? - I'm gonna tell her. I mean, I want to tell her. I don't want to keep hiding it from her. - Just be honest and be up front. Show her who you truly are. That's always worked for me. - (sighs) I just wish he could be like this in person. It's like I'm dealing with two different people. - Yeah, that's not okay. - I just gotta get him to open up when were together. - Tell him. - Mm-hmm. (phone dings) - She's asking why my writing is so much better than-- - Spoken word? That's easy, writing comes from the heart. It takes time. I mean, when we write things down it's more precise. It lasts longer than anything that just comes out of our mouth. (phone chimes) Sorry. Oh. Hi, Mom. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay, bye. I gotta go. - Uh, David, I need another favor. - Really, dude? - What? - [Emily] You like him already? It's "Stairway to Heaven." - What? (playful music) - I haven't been this nervous since my first month of law school. - Don't worry, I'll be in your ear the whole time. - Why's your shirt off? - Well, don't you need to wire me up? - No, we got the Bluetooth headphones. - Oh. - Josh. - What's up? - Just, shirt. - Oh, right. - Honey, Daddy has some important work to do with Uncle Josh, so do you promise me you'll stay in here? - Yes. - Do you promise? - I promise. - Okay, okay, thank you, good girl. (static crackling) Josh, I'm getting, like, some static here. - It's windy today, huh? - Mm-hmm. - Is it supposed to snow? - I don't know. I hope we have a white Christmas. - Me too, I, uh, I love snow. - Stop, stop talking about the weather. That's what people talk about when they have nothing to say. - Okay. - What? - Oh, nothing. - Just say, I find the juxtaposition of white snow and red leaves compelling and-- - I find the juxtaposition of white snow on red leaves to be compelling. - I wonder why we find it so beautiful. What is the evolutionary purpose? Okay, you've got the bare trees of winter, which-- - Take the bare trees of winter, they're not much to look at on their own. But if you add some fallen snow, it transforms it into something majestic, a beautiful vista. - I've never thought about it like that. - Yeah, it makes you think of other things, or people even, who could, with a little effort-- - With a little effort, transform into something else. - Hmm, there's a, there's a metaphor in that or maybe some symbolism, I think. Maybe I'll have to add it to my next year's curriculum (laughs). - What? What, what? What? - What? - You gotta get closer man. I can't hear her. What'd she say? - I just said maybe I'll have to add it to next year's curriculum. - Oh, I heard you. - Me, you heard me? - No. - Are you okay? - I'm sorry. I'm just a little stressed from the case. - Oh. - Could we just sit down over there? - Yes, of course. - Oh, please. (Josh chuckles) - What is on your face! - What is on your face? - What? - Oh, Josh, I'm sorry. I forgot to hit the mute button. - I'm sorry. That was just a bad joke. - About my face? - What, did you get mugged by a chocolate bar? What's going on here? - No, no, no, no, no. Look, I'm sorry, okay. - What is it? Just tell me what's on it, I'll get it-- - Nothing. - I'll get it off. - There's nothing, really. - Don't, don't, don't, sorry. Stop, listen. Sorry, I got tripped up. Just say-- - I just got a little tripped up, but what I wanted to say is, what is it about your face that just undoes me? The shape and symmetry. - Well, thank you. I'm glad that you find me symmetrical. Symmetry is good. I find you symmetrical, too, Josh. - Yeah. Thanks. - You're all sticky. I'm gonna have to clean you all up. - You're all sticky. I'm gonna have to clean you all up. - Josh! What? - I-- - Boop. - I am so sorry. - I think I need to, I think I'm gonna get going. - I didn't mean to be risque. - Yeah, I'm, I'm not ready for that yet. - I love you, Daddy. - I love you, Honey. - I love you, too. - Oh, no, I'm sorry. Don't, don't say that, no, no, no. - You what? - Oh, God. - I love you? - You do? - I know it seems soon, but I don't wanna lie to you. I want you to know how I feel about you. - Uh (sighs), but it's, I'm not ready to say that yet. - Do you think you would be ready, one day, maybe? (gentle music) - I'm gonna go. I'll see you. (solemn music) - Oh, boy. (solemn music) - Emily, where's Sean? (solemn music) Well, we should reschedule. - Yeah, okay, that's fine, yeah. Thank you. - Have a good day, Emily. - Sorry. Thanks. (bell dings) - Hey, sorry, I'm late. What are you-- - Don't. I'm sorry, too. (Sean grunts) (solemn music) (David sighs) - Dad, is that me? - Yes, it is. That is you. - Mommy was really pretty. - She was. You know, she was a lot more that that. - I miss having her here at Christmas. - You do? - She made cookies way better than you do. (David laughs) - Yes, she did make them better than I do. - I miss your smile. You're sad too much. - You don't think I smile? - Not like you used to. You did when talking to your friend at work. She seems nice. - She is very nice. Go hang that up. (phone rings) Hello? Um, yeah, do you guys have reservations tomorrow at seven o'clock? You do? Can I get two for David Martin, please? Thank you. Bye. - Why are you smiling like that? - Smiling like what, like this (grunts)? - That's ridiculous. - You're ridiculous, come here. (bright music) - Autonomy. Because of her, I'm kind of doing this now. (sighs) My sister is so maddening. She won't stop talking about her pregnancy. - Well, it's kind of a big deal. - Well, I know. It just seems like a lot of work and a lot of responsibility. Whole thing kinda gives me anxiety. (David laughs) Well, what was it like becoming a father, I mean? - You know, before Molly was born, I thought it'd be really great to be the first voice she ever heard. And I wanted to say something profound like Neil Armstrong's man on the moon moment. And, uh, my wife was in labor for a really long time, and, like, after 18 hours-- - Oh, that's a really long time. - Yes, I said it was a long time, and it sort of happened real fast and, all of a sudden, there she was. She's being born, and it was so complex. It was so beautiful. I'm not a religious person, but it's the first time in my life I believed in God without question. - So what'd you say to her? - I didn't say anything. I was too busy crying to say anything. And my wife held her in her arms. She looked down at her and she said. "Oh, you're so pretty." And I couldn't top that, so I didn't try. And I loved her in an instant. And I realized how self-centered I had been and Molly brought me out of that, to have this little person there, who is completely dependent on you, just, she's my whole world. She's all of it. (David sighs) - We're here. - Yeah. - That was beautiful. - Thanks. I'll get this stuff out. - Yeah. (car door thuds) - Oh, hey, by the way, you were right. "Yesterday" was written by Paul. I can't believe I didn't know that. It's kind of my song. So congratulations. - In a 100 years, people are still gonna know that song. I'm sure of it. It's one of those pieces of creativity that will just live forever, you know. Hey, did you ever decide who you're bringing to the formal? - Yeah, I thought about it and I got somebody. I just haven't asked 'em yet. - Well, what's stopping you? - Just waiting for the right moment. - You must never hesitate. (David laughs) - Is that Sean Connery from "The Rock"? - Yeah, it's so bad. - That's amazing. - No. - That was really good. - [Holly] It's really, really bad. - No, it was really good. (both laughing) - Thanks, no, but seriously, you shouldn't wait, because you don't know if it'll be too late. Take it from somebody who is a waiter, me, not a waiter at a restaurant, a person who waits. You get what I'm saying. I just, I just had an idea. - Do you want to go to the dance-- Would you wanna double date, What? - Uh, what? You, you, you go first. - Oh, I said maybe you and whomever you decide to take to the formal and me and my new boyfriend, we could go get a drink, before or after. - Yes, yes. Cool. - Yeah. - Huh. - Come on, let's get this stuff put together. - You, uh, you go ahead. I need to make a quick phone call, so I'll be right back. - Okay. (David sighs) - Hi, I had a reservation for two tonight at 7:30, and I can't make it. Martin is the name. No, I don't need to reschedule. Thank you. - If I fail them all, I get fired. - Hey. - Hey, you, what are you doing here? - I was coming to tell you that I don't need you to cover my class, 'cause my dinner plans got canceled. - Oh, I prepped an entire thing for "Midsummer Night's Dream." - Yeah. - I haven't taught it since grad school, 'cause I'm a maths teacher. - Well, right, I'm so sorry. It's funny, "Midsummer Night's Dream," Molly dressed up as Puck for Halloween. How crazy is that? - If you don't show me pictures of that right now, I'm gonna spontaneously combust. Oh my, look at the face. She's very, she's a happy Puck. Oh! (phone chimes) - Oh, sorry. Hey, hey, I gotta call you back, okay? All right, bye. - How do you know, um, how do you know Josh Wright? That's Holly's boyfriend. I was telling you about him, the guy on the app. - Oh, uh, Holly Weiss in accounting? - No, who's that? - Holly Fanzler in IT? - How many Holly's are in this school? No, my Holly Willinger, the professor, the one with blond hair and glasses, been at my wedding. You've seen her loads of times. You're doing the Christmas formal with her. How's the color scheme going? Have you decided? (David coughs) You okay? - I gotta go. - What happened? You good? - Talk to you later. (knuckles rapping) - David, you never called me back last night. - I'm done. I can't do it anymore. - With Holly? - With Holly, yeah. - I'm sorry. I should've told you she was a professor at the school. I know it was probably unethical, what you did. - What I did? - Yeah. - What we did. It's what we did. Anyway, it's over so, goodbye, Josh, good luck. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, just slow down, 'cause actually, I have some good news. I just got off the phone with Southern Edge University. - Sure, you did. - Oh, check the call history. I just spoke to Cori Johnson. She's their recruiter, and she wants to meet you. - She wants to meet me-- - I'm not pressuring you, David. You make your own decisions. I'm just asking you for one last time. - You're not going to hold this job thing over my head? - Absolutely not. I did what I could. Now she's coming up to meet you, and the rest is on your shoulders. (Holly coughs) - Can you even hear me from all the way down there? - [David] What? - I said, can you even-- - No, I was kidding. I have a ton of papers to grade, because it's finals, so... - You okay? - Yeah. - You don't seem okay. - I really do. I have a lot of papers to grade. - You said that. - I'm not lying. - Oh, okay, well, we can just cancel this-- - Okay. (David sighs) (phone dings) (solemn music) (Holly chuckles) - So how was your day? - It was busy. The Christmas formal is coming up fast. Could we listen to some Christmas music? - Sure. ("O Come, All Ye Faithful") You remind me of my mother. - (laughs) That's incredibly weird. - Why? - Never mind, Josh. - Actually, I prefer Joshua. - You want me to call you Joshua? - If you would. - Sure, Joshua. - Are you okay? - (laughs) Yeah, I'm fine. I just have to get used to the two different versions of you, you know, the litigator, the writer, Josh, Joshua. It's confusing. - I'm working on it. ("O Come, All Ye Faithful") Excuse me. (phone dings) (tense music) Call David Martin. (Molly chuckles) (tense music) (Josh sighs) (tense music) (Holly sighs) - "Sunlight on my cave of ice," what a metaphor. It's brilliant. - That's beautiful. Did you just write that for me? - No. - What? - Forget something? - No, I've got it right here. - That's mine. - The phone? - What, were you just calling Christa or Gabrielle? - What? No, I was actually just trying to call David. - With my phone? You took my phone. - Oh, no. - Oh, yeah. - I can explain. - I couldn't help but notice these text messages with beautiful prose and imagery and diction, from David! - I really can explain. - And then the same beautiful prose and imagery and diction and text messages to Christa and Cori and, uh, Gabrielle. That's why you've been two completely different people. - No, no, no, no, I was just having him proofread-- - Stop lying. Wow, you are a colossal jerk, for having someone ghostwrite a soul for you that you obviously don't possess, an even bigger jerk for taking what you stole and mass-marketing it to persuade any woman you want that you're actually a human being. - Look, wait, just let me-- - Which you're not. You're subhuman, artificial unintelligence. (scoffs) I can't believe I, I fell for this, I mean-- - I know, I know, and I'm sorry, so just-- - (sobs) Oh my God, no. (Josh sighs) I'm done. (Holly gasps) (phone chimes) Not now, Carol. (Holly sniffs) (phone chiming) Hey! - We bought a house. - Oh (chuckles), that's great. - It's amazing. I mean, we couldn't have done it if Mom and Dad didn't help us with the down payment. - Well, I'm, I'm so happy for you. - Oh, and the baby's room is absolutely perfect. I designed it myself. I cannot wait to show you and your new boyfriend when you come for Christmas. - Yeah, um (sniffs), about that, um-- - He's a lawyer, right, Holly? You can not let this one get away, okay? He could support you for the rest of your life. (Holly sighs) (students chattering) - Okay, I'll see you guys on Monday. (students chattering) (gentle music) You know? - Yeah, I do. How could you? - I'm sorry. I had no idea. - That was just so wrong. - I know, and I'm sorry. - I feel so stupid. - I meant every word. - What is that supposed to mean, David? - I wrote those letters to you. - What are you trying to say? - I wrote every word, thinking about you. I had no idea who Josh was seeing. - So you're some kind of modern Cyrano de Bergerac and I'm your Roxane? - Dante had Beatrice. Petrarch had Laura. I had you. You told me not to hesitate, remember? I did. I'm not hesitating anymore. - So I was your muse? - Hey, you call it whatever. You filled me up. You lit a fire inside of me. I woke up and I came alive when I met you. Sunlight on my cave of ice. Yeah? You did that. - (scoffs) But that's not giving, David. That's, that's not love. That's, that's using. You (sighs), you used to be in some kind of stupid game with your bro roommate. (Holly scoffs) I don't care what you do. I'm done. - Hey, sorry, I'm late. I had some eggnog, and I forgot I was lactose intolerant. I won't describe the rest to you, but it was, uh, not fun. Do you think I could help you, please? - Just leave me alone, okay? Just go blow up some balloons or something. (solemn piano music) * You walked into my life * Like a ray of light * Didn't know what to do * I couldn't see just what was real * * And all the things that I feel * * Couldn't say to you * Guess I loved you at first glance * - So your gut instinct was right about Mr. Wright? - I can't believe that I fell for that superficial, soulless, Popsicle, pretty boy. All I want to do is crawl into my bed and never leave. - [Emily] Oh, honey. - And you know, the weirdest part of it is, I can't believe that David Martin went along with it. - I'm sure Josh litigated him into submission. But, David wrote those words about you, and they came from his heart, Holly. He's sorry. He didn't know Josh was with you. - It doesn't make it right. - [Emily] I agree. - I mean, they were nice, though. - What were nice, the poems? Did you keep the poems? Were the poems nice? - I mean, they were nice, yeah. - Can I read them? - Yeah. (Emily sighs) * If you're not with me - Wow. * Don't feel the same * I spend my day reflecting - Wow, they... Well, this is a gift, Holly. Honey, you still hesitating? Okay. Let me put it in words that you will definitely understand. You have spent years reading and admiring dead writers, correct? Okay, well, now it looks like you might actually have- - A live one, I know. - Yes, yes, with a pulse and a soul, Holly. - I've just never, I've never thought of him that way. He's a friend. - Okay, just my humble opinion, these words were written by an attractive man with a soul, and they were written from his heart. Listen to me. I'm sorry that I steered you in the wrong direction, because I did. But it's not too late, okay? * I spend my day reflecting who * - Too late for what? - To get it right! Holly, go home, forget Josh, he never even existed, and reread these poems, because they are written by David, and they are literally to you. - [Man] He's having lunch at Eileen's. - Okay. - [Cori] David, thank you so much for coming. I know it's finals week. - Oh well, you know, it is a busy time. - So I have some questions. - Okay, fire away. - How do you know Josh? - That's an easy question. Thank you. Josh and I went to college together. We were roommates in college, so I've known him a long time. - I didn't know that. - How do you know Josh? - I met him in Cabo, two years ago. He was on vacation. - Oh, yeah, on vacation, okay. - Yeah, but he was very sad. His friend's wife had died. I guess that's when we began dating. - You dating, okay. - Yeah, he got me the job at Southern Edge. He's such a great guy. - Oh, you're dating now? - Yeah, lately, he blew me away with some of the things he wrote. I mean, that's why when he recommended you, I thought it means something coming from a writer like Josh. - Yeah, a writer like Josh. Well... - Yeah. Have you read any of his latest work? - Josh, the brilliant writer, that's interesting. - You didn't know he wrote? - No, but Josh is a very surprising, surprising guy. He's a brilliant, surprising guy. Can I get a drink? Do you, would you like a drink? (customers chattering) - [Holly] (scoffs) I'm so naive. (students chattering) - Going somewhere? - It's the end of the semester. I'm packing up. - Let me carry those. - They're empty. - Well, still, it looks bad if I don't. You know, you never gave me a chance to say I'm sorry. - It wouldn't have mattered. - I know. I deceived you. I was supposedly this fun, witty, charming guy, but around you, I was, I was complimenting your teeth. - And a fine set of teeth they are. - I was really looking forward to meeting Carol and the rest of your family, winning them over, proving my worth to you. - By hiring someone to write poetry, so you can plagiarize it? I mean, how fake is that Josh? Think about it. - The feelings weren't fake, aren't fake. The formal is tonight. I could still take you, if you let me. - Have you spoken to David? - No, no, I set him up on an interview yesterday at Eileen's, and I've just stayed out of his way, since then. - An interview? - Yeah, Southern Edge University. Yeah, I think he's getting out of here. So what do you say? Can I take you tonight? - I'm sorry. (phone dings) (Josh laughing) (both laughing) (people chattering) (footsteps clacking) (breath hissing) (phone dings) - Thank you, Santa. - Hey, how you doin'? Good to see you guys, hey. Hey, what's up, man? Thank you for coming. How are you? Hi. - Hi, great party. - Thank you. Glad you came. - [Man] Very funny. I wouldn't say very funny out loud, but it is. - Oh no, no. - It really is. ("The First Noel") - Hello. - Hi, how are you? The Math Department in the house. - How are you doing? Congratulations, it all looks perfect. - Oh thank you. - I like the red balloons. - Yeah. - Hey. What's wrong? - Passing off David's poetry as your own, not just once, but again and again, with other women? - And then you dangle a job to bribe your ghostwriter into helping you? - It's, it's not what you think, okay? - You're unbelievable. - What? Gabrielle, I was gonna call ya. - Jerk. - Christa, well, you look... Oh, not the margarita. - Liar. - Ugh, that's, that's sticky. (heels clacking) (Josh sighs) Erin? - I saw that coming. - I didn't. (Erin laughs) - You should have. - You're right. - Merry Christmas. (customers chattering) (phone rings) (phone chimes) - Hello. - David. - Hey, Josh. - I just wanted to say I'm sorry. It was wrong to dangle the job. I apologize. (David sighs) - Well, it's Christmastime, so peace on earth and good will to everyone, including you, Josh. Anyway, I'm not gonna take the job. - I'm sure it's still available, if you want it. You let me know, if you change your mind. I'll help, no strings. - No, I think I'm good here. - Well, all right, then. One last thing, Holly's the one for you. I know. She's the girl of your dreams, so run, go out there and get her. Don't let her get away. Merry Christmas, David. - Merry Christmas, Josh. (dramatic music) - Oh, Mrs. Gunderman, have you seen Professor Martin? - No, I believe he and his date went that way. - His date? - Oh, oh, where are you going? (Holly grunts) No, you're not leaving, come on. (Holly sighs) - Oh, where were you going? - I wanted to go change my shoes. - Why? - Because I am wearing these for someone who is here with someone else and I'm just (sighs), I'm confused, and I feel stupid, once again. - Holly, why do you think David's here with someone else? - Mrs. Whats-Her-Name said that he took his date to the bathroom. - (laughs) Sorry. - His date. How is that possibly funny? - I'm so sorry. Honey, will you trust me? I think you'll have a really good time if you just stay a little bit. (gasps) What? - Shh, dance with me. (bright music) (Emily laughs) Remember when I missed those meetings? - Yeah. - This is why. - Well, I feel bad. - Good. - That's so sweet. (man laughing) (guests chattering) (solemn music) - Oh, it's the second prettiest girl at the dance. - [Molly] Who's the prettiest? - You, of course, duh. - Your daddy has you out late tonight, huh, Molly? - It's holidays. He said he needed a date. - Well, I have to say you are the most beautiful date that he will ever have, ever. - Dad, you can take her on a date. - Oh, okay. - Take her to the zoo, Dad. - Let's take her to the zoo, Molls. - Well, hey there, Molly. Do you want to come with me? Let's go find something fun. What did you ask Santa for? - So (sighs). - Um, I want you to know that every word I wrote in those letters was about you, every thought, every syllable. It was about you, 'cause you, you, um, you make me feel alive again. You know, you make me feel joy. You make me want to-- - I'm sorry, David. - Oh, it's okay. I understand. - No, no, I'm, I'm sorry, 'cause you're gonna have to meet my really annoying sister at Christmas (laughs), if you're willing, you and Molly. (David laughs) - Yeah. I just, I just-- - Shh. Less words. (gentle music) (guests chattering) - [Man] I'll talk here with my wife. With you, I talk with my mouth open. * Christmas bells all around town * * But nothing compares to the sound * * Of my laughter when you're around * * All the snowflakes gather in the street * * And my heart skips a beat * 'Cause it's cold outside, but I feel the heat * * I'm runnin' in circles in my mind * * 'Cause I'm so happy that you're mine * * Can't find the words to say * How you make my holiday * I've never felt this way * And, baby, that's okay * My heart beats still faster * 'Cause you're my ever after * Try to find the words to say * How you make my holiday * Can't find the words to say * How you make my hol, make my holiday * * I've never felt this way * And, baby, that's okay * My heart beats still faster * 'Cause you're my ever after * Just you and me * You're all I ever need * Can't find the words to say * How you make my hol, make my holiday * * Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah, yeah * * Ooh, ooh, ooh, make my holiday * * Ooh, ooh, ooh, make my holiday * * I've never felt this way * You make my holiday
