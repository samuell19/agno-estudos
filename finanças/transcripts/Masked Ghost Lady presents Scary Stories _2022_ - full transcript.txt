This film is brought to you by the Los Angeles Cinefest film festival the Hollywood screenings film festival and the oh scares awards I see you are ready. Already. Hahaha... Let's begin, then. Enjoy. Masked ghost lady. Do you like scary movies, Sydney? Hmmm. Hello everyone. You probably know my brother in law from the big screen. Yes, he wanted to be here with us. But unfortunately, he can't. He is in Sydney. Yes, you heard right. He is in Sydney. Sydney, Australia, that is. He is promoting. His new book called do you want to dye your hair to a blonde color Sydney? Any how, I'm here instead. I present to you scary stories previously selected by the Los Angeles Cinefest film festival and the oh scares awards. I can't see shit through this latex mask. Can somebody read it please? Hightail. Hair of the dog. Dead end drive. Searching. His shadow. Now, you can watch and decide which story you like the most. Oh, maybe it was: Do you want to dye your hair to a red color, Sydney? Anyway, enjoy your screening everyone. Why don't we tag along with your friend Carol like we did last year? Because I'm tired of hearing about how her husband cheated on her again for the fourth time and yet she refuses to leave him because their eternal bond is too strong. Too strong. Hi, Carol. Hey, handsome. Okay, time to go. God, this place gives me the creeps. I've never seen anyone come or go from it. Same. Whoa. No, sir. You're not going to step an inch toward that place. Just let him go. We're right here. Are you crazy? What if some psychopedophile lives there? Seriously? What if they're just not that in the Halloween? Like, relax. Let be fine. Okay? Okay. Look. I don't I don't know why you worry so much. I mean it's it's not like he's out here by himself. I'm sorry for wanting to keep our kids safe. Honey, they may not be home. That's strange. Oh my god. Leo. God, I told you it wasn't safe. Why did I listen to you? Can you break it down? I'm going to try. Just call the police. Find him. 911. What's your emergency? What the hell? Leo. Leo. Wes? Oh. Where the hell are you? Where is my son? Leo? Wes, ah. I should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas. Ethan. Ethan. Ethan. Rise and shine tigers. This is your wake up call. It's 6 am but right now, let's focus on your nine o'clock. Take a peek. Ethan. Another bad dream babes? Your chest hair has started to turn gray. I like it. It reminds me of my dad. Do I ever remind you of your daughter? Hahaha... What the hell is wrong with you? Hahaha... Not a damn thing. I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker and I have seen the eternal footman hold my coat and snickered. And in short, I was afraid. Been having lucid dreams? Like really lucid? Can't seem to stay asleep or stay awake. It's getting really hard to tell which is which. Any muscle aches, stiffness in the joints, that sort of thing. Lost of flexibility, range of motion. No. Any problems at all aside from insomnia. What's wrong with me? Nothing. The trouble is there is no trouble. I'm looking at the results of your physical and you're in perfect health. So that's good, right? These are the test results from a year ago before the accident. High blood pressure, bit of weight gain, mild heart arrhythmia. Today, average blood pressure. Tell him we've been jogging. Yeah, we've, I've been jogging. Jogging won't fix an arrhythmia. And then there are the results of the x rays. In the accident, you broke two bones in your left arm. You had a compound fracture, the tibia of the left leg. There are no signs those bones have been broken now. I've been your doctor for 10 years, mister Russell. Russoff and you're not just in good shape and you're in better shape than you've ever been. After all the injuries you had, those joints should be screaming bloody murder every time it rains and you're feeling no pain at all. What might account for something like that? Hell if I know if I did I'd be bottling it and selling it. I wonder if we might try something. Gonna get you to close your eyes. Now just focus on the sound of my voice. Focus. Focus, focus, focus. And open. Not exactly sure how this works. Not even sure I'm in the right place. I've never really been a fan of organized religion. And you're definitely in the right place. Christianity is one of the most disorganized religions in the world. You're unchurched? Uh, over churched. I think I used to believe in god and the church talked me out of it. Understandable. You know, when Jesus was a boy, his own parents lost him at a church. Found him there too though. This is completely confidential rhymes like talking to a lawyer? Like talking to a lawyer? I mean, the only time I'd hypothetically have to break silence is if you had plans for something suicidal or homicidal. Can we live with those terms? What about his terms? Whose? The judge? Nah, I think it's going to be alright with him too. So, you're here because you've done something you're sorry for? Yes. Then all you have to do is confess it. What if I know I'm going to do it again? Some might say that exceeds the boundaries of being sorry. No, I I don't want to do it again. I just, I know that I will. Uh... And maybe I've exceeded the boundaries of being forgivable. Nah, you're not going to shock me, son. We're all mad here. This year's birthday. It was a big four O. So my friends and me we we decided we make a weekend of it. There's this cave system just over in bray county. Unexplored stuff. The time of my resurrection. I've been dead for almost 2 hours. How's that possible? It's not. Yeah, the brain can't be deprived of oxygen that long and at best, I should be in some kind of vegetative state. You don't seem very vegetative. No. No. In fact, I'm sharper than ever. Unless I'm still in that hole. Let's pretend I'm real and not part of your head. Okay. You're here because you feel like this accident changed you somehow? Not change me. No. I feel like when I woke up, something else woke up with me again. Like it woke up in me. Ethan? Gotta have a family. Ethan? Don't tech me. I have a wife and I have a little girl and they're scared of me. I'm scared too. It's like I'm standing just sobbing. Burned out a wreckage of my own life, you know And I realize I'm not crying because of everything I've lost. I'm crying because I missed the damn fire. You tell me there's something in your disorganized religion about that. The apostle Paul says we all have two natures the carnal and the spiritual the old man and the new both always hungry and we're always feeding one or the other. So how does one get rid of the old man? Mortification. There's no reasoning with it. It has to be put to death, crucified. There's no quick fix, I'm afraid. No silver bullets. Do I dare disturb the universe? In a minute, there is time for decisions and revisions. My name is Ethan. Which minute I will rehearse. And… I am… I am aware. Hey, sorry I hesitated back there. No worries. I've probably done the same. Mhm. Yeah. Ok. Would you like a cold one? Cold one? Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. I yeah. Cold one. Be good. Great. Hey, how'd you do that whole gate thing? Those solar panels. The gate and pretty much everything around here. Jacob and I are what you might call preppers. So, when the shit hit the fan, you could say we was already ready already. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh man. That was good. What about outside? Oh, you don't have to worry about that. Between the gate and the few other tricks we got set up for 'em. It would take a whole ocean of 'em. Well, from what I just saw that. Looks like we got ourselves a house guest. How goes it, buddy? Good. Good. Thanks. Hey, baby. Hey. Who we got here? Well, we ain't get that far yet, sugar booger. What you say your name is, sweetie? I didn't. Um sorry. My name's Oscar. Um Jacob right? Don't stand up on my account Oscar. Sorry I didn't mean to. Oh don't mind him. He just hadn't had any entertainment since all this started. I'm Darcy. Oh hi Darcy. I.. I'm sorry I didn't. No more sorry Oscar mayor. Alright the world's sorry enough. We gotta focus on the brighter side of things. What's for dinner darling? Oh well I do have them leftovers from last night. God damn honey leftovers? Oh. Well we gotta guest. He doesn't want any leftovers. You don't want and damn leftovers right? Oh no. I mean I no don't worry about me. I don't I don't need any leftovers. I mean I would love leftovers but I don't need them. I... I don't I don't need anything really. I just just need a place to stay for the night until sunrise maybe. Uh, is that okay? No. Oh hell no. No? No you ain't not staying for dinner. Look. My woman makes some of the best cooking from here to Kansas. Oh hey, yeah. So strap in fellow. Really? I trust I don't need anything. I already imposed that. Nope. Nope. Too late. Done deal. Mhm. You're here for dinner. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And don't forget dessert. Hot apple pie. Hot apple pie. Yes sir. Holy shit Oscar Wilde. You are something special. Oscar, you better finish up all them vegetables. They are fresh from the garden and they are real real good for you. Don't worry, ma'am. Be sure to clean my plate and clean up after myself. I know it's the apocalypse and all but still haven't lost my manner. Well that is so kind to you and we certainly do appreciate it. After you help clean up them dishes, you should probably wash yourself. There's hot water right at the tub. Really? No, I can't waste your water like that. Oh no, don't you worry about it. Get put right out to the garden. Besides, you need it. You are on the right side of a three-day dead skunk. Shit. Sorry. Just been so long since I've been around. Don't worry. People. Ain't no thing, Oscar Mcgrouch. We all been through the trash before. Mm hmm. I try not to smell like us. I think it keeps them from noticing. Well, we will get you smelling like a Daisy in no time. Yeah and don't you worry about them outsiders, alright? Once the critters start running around in the morning, they'll be chasing after them like coon dogs. You'll you'll have a straight shot through the woods to the lake. Lake? Yeah, it's a big lake. So big, they can't follow. And on the other side, there's a hidden mining trail that leads you all the way to salvation. I I thought this was salvation. Oh, hell no, buddy. This is just the first stop. But if you know it's there, why you're still here? Some things just ain't that easy. Right. The chair. Sorry. You know, we got other reasons but that's one of em. Plus, I'd rather die in my own home. Okay. Then out there. I think it's time for me to finish cleaning up here. Sugar, what about dessert? We can get to that after, baby. Alright, I'll leave you all to it. I gotta take a piss anyhow. You take good care of my girl, Oscar. Oh yeah yes sir. You got it. Can't wait to taste that sweet pie baby. I will come find you when it's ready. Mm hmm. Looking forward to it. So nice having a little helper again. How long has he been. Oh, longer than I known him. He fell out of a truck when he was a boy. Been in a chair most of his life. Well, take great care of him. We take great care of each other. I get that. I just was surprised to see someone so crippled. Grateful alive. No, not at all. I was going to say challenged, surviving, through all this. Look Darcey, I gotta be straight with you. Remember before when you said it would take a whole ocean of them to get in here? Yeah because we got all these Tsunami. I'm a day ahead about a thousand of these fuckers I'm going to tear through here tomorrow and we need to be gone. I'm sure we've been through worse. Not like this. There's over 100 us living in brick buildings behind a giant iron fence. They tore that place down like locusts. I'm the only one left. No, we need to go at first light. Jacob already told you there ain't no way the two of us can get him there. I know. And he's right. We can. Ok. So you want me to run off with you and leave my husband here to die? No, no, no. Or you want to kill him? No, it's done. No. It's not what I meant, dad. Look, we'll barricade him in. We'll go to the salvation and we'll bring back enough help to get him there safely. It will take at least a week to do that. And if he survived, he'd be covered in bedsores and I ain't willing to put him through that. So you can leave by yourself in the morning. We got plenty of supplies downstairs. You can take whatever you can carry. I get it. I really do. The love you have is amazing and... and you don't want to live without him. I... I don't want to take that away from you but it's not fair. You deserve to live, Darcy. There's a shit ton of evil out there and we need all the good people we can get and you good people. You both are. Well. We prepared for everything including today. We may be simple people but we ain't stupid. Jacob's been on that cb every day. We knew something was coming. He just didn't expect you. I'm not trying to take you from your husband. I just don't want you to die. I ain't going to die, Oscar. Cuz, I'm coming with you. Really? You will. What about Jacob? I'm going to take him a piece of that pie and I'm going to tuck him in the bed and I'll tell him. We didn't even expect to survive this long out here on our own. Jacob's been waiting for someone like you to come along. Someone who could get me safely to salvation. Yes, absolutely. I'll get you there but that doesn't mean we need to give up on Jacob. He ain't going to change his mind. So why don't you go and get cleaned up and I'll go prepare Jacob then we can go get supplies and he ain't going to say goodbye. Yeah, I know. I... I get that. I understand. Yeah, just down the hall. Second door on the right. Okay, great. I'm sorry. Don't be Oscar. You're saving us. Ok. Sorry about Jacob. He knows you're a real good fellow and all. He just... He ain't good at goodbyes. No worries. Just hope he doesn't think I'm trying to steal his girl. No, he don't think that at all. He knows you are just trying to help me. Yeah, I just want to you know still be a good human you know. Do whatever it takes to get this world back on track. Yeah. So what types of supplies you folks have down here? Anything you recommend I grab first? What do you suggest? Darcy? Darcy? No. Darcy. Hmm. Well, she sounded hungry. I'm just glad our little girl is finally getting some vegetables. Wait, what about all that beer? Well, we'll just do better next time. Tinny. Kelly? Kelly? Are you here? Kelly, is that you? How is this possible? Hey, beauty. Do you want to have some fun? Where are you going? Hello. Tinny? Please pass the phone to mama. Hello? I'm so sorry. I didn't know. I'm so sorry. Please. I love you no matter what. How have you been, Mateo? Gomez. So, this is where you went. Yeah. I just left some food and. What do you want? I apologize for causing you any stress. I only ever mean to help. It's a tragedy that happened around here and I just wanted to pay my respects. Please leave. It's a shame what happened to him but now. We have your… Hey, Mateo? Mateo. Are you okay? I... I.. I thought I saw something. When's the last time you got some sleep? Or even showered? Uh a couple days ago, I think. I came out from out east and I drove straight through a couple nights. I will get out of your hair and let you get some well-needed rest. I'll see you soon, okay? Oh, god. God damn it! - What are you doing? - You, idiot. I am not crazy. I'm crazy. Hey. What? You making a bonfire or new house. I couldn't decide between the two. So, I just kept chopping. Shit. Look like you could use a break, son. You look like you need some gardening tools. Some good soil you got there. Ever feel like planting anything around here? What? Something like that? This is a root plant. I wanted to get you a nice housewarming gift and show you how to plant it. I grew up on a farm. I think I can handle a little flower. You should put those hands in some ice water. Looks like you have some blisters in your tending. Too much chopping. These stains aren't ever going to come off. Scratching and rubbing only make it worse. You have to accept the pain. That's the first step in healing. Thanks for the flower. I'll make sure to plant it as soon as I can. Anytime son. By the way, thanks for the sandwich. I thought you might be hungry after traveling such a long and unforgiving path. And it was delicious. Not a big fruit guy though. Fruit? The apple. Ah, the apple. Of course. I could come by later with some more sandwiches and we could have some tea if you're interested. Listen, I'm just a bit on edge today. I... I left some chamomile in there. It does wonders for anxiety. What do you say? I guess so. Alright then. I'll come by sometime this afternoon. No. No. I'm sorry I'm late. Duty called. I just boiled the water. Again. You were looking a little skinny so I stuffed yours with extra ham and cheese. Don't worry about me, Gomez. You two are so happy back then. I am sorry. Please, put that down. I meant no offense. I'll go get the tape. How are your hands doing? They're fine. I could take a look at them if you don't mind. So you're a priest and a doctor. What are you a shrink too? Why were you in this house when I first arrived? I wanted to give you a warm welcome when you arrived. You said there was a murder around these parts. You knew the victim. And you know the murderer. I did. And I do. Who was he? Someone I held dear. Tell me who he was. Say his name. He was my son. That's why I took the cross. To save your son's soul. He's out of my hands now. I took the cross because I needed to forgive the man who took him from me. Does that man even deserve forgiveness? That's up to him. He has to decide whether he can forgive himself. He's tearing himself apart right now. His own mind is at war with it. He keeps climbing and cutting and bleeding himself only to stuff it back into darkness. Not allowing himself to be helped or healed. Not allowing himself to face and accept his shadow. He has to decide whether he stays here or moves on. It's what he would have wanted. Put that down. Get out. Get out. I tried to hide it. I am so sorry. I forgive you. Why? You've been running and hiding from it for too long. Mateo? I am so sorry for what I've done. I know it hasn't been easy for you either. I just… I thought you'd be angry with me. The man I was still is but the man I am now will never let you go. I am ready. Uh hey, guys. Do you need me or? Nope. That's it for today. Oh, I thought you wanted me to say something at the end of the compilation or between shorts. I prepared some lines. Nope, that's it. It's a wrap. Finally, I was dying in that mask. Okay, see you next time. I'm a ware... Wrrrrr
