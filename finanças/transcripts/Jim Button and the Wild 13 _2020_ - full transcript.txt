Prepare to anchor! Hurry, you lame mutts! Captain on deck! Hello there! Dragon! Come down and show yourself! What do you want? Where’s Ms. Grindtooth? The Captain of the Wild 13 demands her presence. Ms. Grindtooth has been vanquishhhed. Who dared to do that? - Two engine drivers. They sneaked into Dragon City like thieves. Two engine drivers... One day, our paths will cross. Then you will curse the day that you were born. For we are the Wild 13! Jim Button and the Wild 13 In Morrowland, our island with the two mountains, two houses, one train station and the castle, the weather was usually fine. But of course there were also rainy days. But that doesn’t mean it was a gloomy rain, like we have sometimes. No, nothing of the sort! In Morrowland, even the bad weather wasn’t really bad, it was happy and giddy. It was like a symphony of raindrops. The raindrops splished and splashed and pitter-pattered merrily on the windowsills, the rain gutters gurgled and chattered, and water gushed into the puddles as if an excited crowd were clapping their hands. And on exactly such a rainy day, our story begins this time. You like that, right? Look, Jim. The bridge to New-Morrowland, made of iron, stable enough to carry Molly and Emma. Luke? Molly’s up for a real adventure, don’t you think? You can’t just go looking for an adventure. It has to find you, see? We’ll have adventure again soon. Just you wait. It’s getting unpleasant out here. You go on ahead while I clean up! Okay. What nasty weather. The fog is getting thicker. So, can I get a nice cup of hot tea with a big shot of rum in it? - Sure, Luke. Who wants a piece of fresh cake? -Me! Two ships. I win! That’s what you think! Four ships and one pirate! Are you letting me win on purpose? I wish. But you keep winning, no matter what Ido. It’s easier to fight a city full of dragons. Speaking of that, Your Highness... Luke! You are not to call me that. Li Si. I wanted to ask: How’s that dragon, Ms. Grindtooth, doing? She’s still sound asleep. Her transformation is nearly complete. From head to tail, she gleams like pure gold. I can’t believe she was once an evil dragon. Papa has her guarded night and day. He has ordered to be notified at once when she awakens. Then she will be a Golden Dragon of Wisdom who can answer any question. Do you know what you want to ask her, Jim? Maybe it’s OK we don’t know the answer to all the world’s questions. Help! Help! Good gracious! What’s happened? - Join us, Mr. Sleeve. Help! Holy grease guns... Help me. - Not again! Here! Take my hand. Oh, Your Majesty! Heavens to Betsy! Ms. Whaat, take care of the poor tea and fix him a hot cup of mailman. All packages, save the Morrowlanders! Yes Sir, Your Majesty. Careful, my dear sir... - Excuse me... allow me please... Careful! Oh dear, how clumsy of you. Come here! Mr. Sleeve, just leave it be. - Luke! Good. Give it to me. Quick! Hold on... Mr. Sleeve, why don’t you wait back at home? As you perhaps know, my dearest, I’m an unusually well-educated man and have knowledge at my fingertips that may be of great use in such a situation... In a situation such as this one, you’re just going to get your beautiful new suit dirty. Yes, yes. She’s right. At ease, my friend. - Very well, Your Majesty. Yes, this way! Let me help you! - No, no, don’t be afraid. This way, let’s go get warm. Jim, you have them all? Yes, in times past... Once upon a time, I used to teach Jim but the boy doesn’t need me anymore. Nobody needs me anymore. I go for walks, and get governed. I’m worthless. Poor Mr. Sleeve. We have to find something for him to do. The question is, what? I don’t know how to thank you enough. That’s the third accident now. - But this time was especially bad. The fog was so thick, I could barely see my hand in front of my eyes. And then I struck New-Morrowland... Uh-huh... - Before I forget: the mail. Your Majesty, a package from Your Honorable Mommy. Thanks. Luke, here, this is for you. - Thank you. Your Highness: a letter from your father, the Emperor. Umm... Isthere maybe a letter for me, too? I’m afraid not, Jim. Not this time. And nothing the last time either, and the time before that, and before that... and before that... I’m going to bed then. Good night. Night, Jim. Good night. Are you okay? Oh, Luke. You think I don’t know what Jim will ask the Golden Dragon once it’s awake? What? Where he’s from. Who his parents are. His family. That’s on his mind day and night. Should I have taken better care of you? - You take great care of him! You think of nothing but Jim from morning to night. Maybe that’s not enough. Jim is a good sport. We shouldn’t worry too much about him. What if he finds what he’s looking for, and doesn’t like the answer? What if something happens to him? You know the dangers out there. Danger can be like a mock giant. Afar, it looks big and awful. But the closer you are, the smaller it is. Good night, Luke. Good night, Ms. Whaat. Come in! Morning, sleepyhead. We planned an outing with Molly. - I’ll be right there. So you did get mail? It’s from the box the Wild 13 used to send me to Morrowland. The Wild 13... Papa’s chased them across all the seas, but they’ve always escaped. Not having parents feels strange, doesn’t it? But you have parents. My mother died when I was still very small. I’m so sorry. At home, we have pictures of her. If I had one wish, just one, I would wish to meet her just once. Of my family, there aren’t even pictures. Sometimes I wonder if they ever even existed. I just want to know where I’m from, Li Si. Who I am. Here on Morrowland I won’t find out anything, that’s for sure. My dear servants, umm, subjects. The incident with the mail boat has quite plainly rubbed my eyes in it, is plain as the nose on my, umm, that things cannot continue this way. The U.S. of M. and N.M. are in danger. The what? - The United States of Morrowland and NewMorrowland. And why is that, Your Majesty? The piles occurring, I mean, the occurrences piling up. Since we’ve started diplomatic relations with my friend Pung Ging, the Emperor of Mandala, ship traffic has increased a great deal here. What if his Ship of State... and our coast... went WHAM? Unthinkable! That’s why I’ve decided that something must be done. We need a lighthouse. An excellent idea. But where would we put such a lighthouse? We’re seaming from the bursts. - Majesty, we could ask Mr. Tur Tur! He doesn’t need very much space, but from far away he’s bigger than all lighthouses stacked atop one another. We just have to give him a lamp. Come, Luke! Let’s sail over with Emma and Molly again! That’s much too dangerous! Mr. Tur Tur lives far, far away in the Mirror Desert. We’ll be fine... right, Luke? This is a matter of the utmost urgency. How soon can you set sail? - Tomorrow morning, Your Majesty! If my young colleague says so. I hereby decree that Mr. Tur Tur be brought to Morrowland, and declare the governmental crisis as over. Looks like your wish has come true. Here we go again, right? My dear loyal royal subjects, I am... exceptionally moved. I would like to emphatically concur! The U.S. of M. and N.M. are very proud of you. Come with us... An Imperial ship is picking me up tomorrow. Papa wants me home. Do you always do what Papa wants? You’re just glad you don’t have to go to the Great Ball. Jim? Watch out for yourself. Enough worry talk already, We engine drivers have been through a lot worse, right, Jim? Come on, old buddy. It’s time to go. Are we on course? Aye-aye, Captain! Molly, are you okay? Hello, up there! Did you whistle for me? You’re land dwellers! Hello there, little lady. Luke, that is... - A mermaid. Merpeople view everything wetly, but they’re very nice people. What odd manner of ship are these? Emma and Molly are locomotives. They sail with fire and steam. My name’s Sursulapichi! Excuse me, dear friends, but if you know about steam, then maybe you know about machines, electricity, magnets and such things? - Of course. Please, follow me to the Big Guru moosh Magnet Rock. My great-great-great-great-greatgrandfather, the first Sea King, had it built long ago. It worked for millennia, but now, all is dark! What exactly is the problem? - The aquatic light has gone out. Well, we can have a look. But we don’t have a lot of time to lose. Yes. What’s that, then? My beloved Ushurishoom. Perhaps you know him? I’m afraid not. He’s such a charming schicknick! And he’s still so young! Hardly ten thousand years old. But he’s so smart. Where is he now then? It’s a sad story. My daddy is terribly old-fashioned, you see. He forbids our marriage until we find the Eternal Crystal. The Eternal Crystal? A very unique glass that never breaks! How it’s made is a big secret. We’ve been looking for it for four hundred years now. You’ll find it one day for sure. You don’t get it! To make Eternal Crystal, we need the aid of a fire creature. Millennia ago, they were our friends. But now they’re our mortal enemies. It’s hopeless. The Gurumoosh Magnet Rock... Come on, my girl, don’t let me down now. The entrance to the lighting system is up there. Please be careful, my friends! So, let’s go take a look... Luke! There’s the entrance. We must be far below sea level now. Close to the earth’s core. Is that why it’s so hot? - The deeper, the hotter, because the earth’s core is hot. Is it much further? The shaft ends here. Looks like someone removed something here. There’s some writing here... “This is the secret truth of the first Sea King Gurumoosh... Whosoever understands it is smart. Whosoever applies it is powerful.” “The mighty power of night and day slumbers hidden here and there. When they’re separate they sleep on. When they’re connected — the might awakens.” If we connect the two ends... - ... the might awakens. Yes. We have to find the missing piece. Luke! Good work, Jim. Don’t worry, it won’t hurt us. It’s not caused by electricity, but by enormous magnetic forces. The secret power of King Gurumoosh. Luke... look at all that! Not bad for two Morrowlanders, or? All those ships... The magnet pulled the nails from their hulls. They didn’t have a chance. What’re you doing up there, Molly? Holy train tracks! Must be the magnet.... I’ve never seen anything like this. You did it! You did it! Thank you. Isn’t the aquatic light beautiful? I have to tell the others! Wait! S ursula p i ch i. We can’t get away from here. The magnet pulls on our locomotives. Oh, heavens to the deep blue sea! So what should we do? We have to turn the light off again. But... Maybe someone can turn it on when we’re far enough away. But they can never leave, and must turn it off as needed. And be able to take the heat down there. My Ushurishoom. He has his shell. He doesn’t mind heat. But for you it’s life threatening. You two could never be together again. Maybe I can see my darling from a distance, as he stands guard. Don’t you worry, my dear friends. But... Sursulapichi! Wait. We’ll find someone else. Definitely! I’m sure. Your ocean will glow again soon. Thanks for everything, friends. Farewell. Come on, Jim. Let’s go turn it off. Take some candles along! Molly! Everything okay? Molly.., are you okay? We should leave before it gets dark. Jiiimmm! Luke! You hurt yourself? - Blow me down, lad. How did you do that? These two rocks, I found them on opposite sides of the rock peaks. Just now I connected them with the hammer, by accident. Luke, did you see that power? It pulled Emma as if she were nothing! As if she were nothing... Of course! You could... Yes, little lady. Wait and see. You’re going to like this, little lady. Jim. Wake up! Wake up! What did you do to Emma? A perpetual motion machine. An invention you led me to, Jim. And what can a perpetual machine do? Provide us with unlimited energy. If it works, Emma won’t need coal, she’ll be able to take us to any place in the world. We, urn, just have one problem. I had to unrig Molly’s basket so it works. Unrig? But how do we take Molly, then? We don’t. We have to leave her here. You saw how strong the magnet is. We can’t run the risk. It would be too dangerous for Molly. I’m sorry. No, Molly. I don’t get it either. It won’t be for long. We’ll be back soon. Don’t be scared. Dear Stranger, if you find Molly, please leave her here. We’ll be back to pick her up soon. Jim and Luke Don’t be sad about Molly. If this thing works, we’ll be back before you can say “Morrowland”. Ready? Hang on tight. “Moorrooowlaaa. . . Wait! It gets even better. Jim! Next stop: Mr. Tur Tur’s oasis. The Wild 13... Luke... Jim! Let go! Hold on! Boy oh boy, that was close. The Wild 13! The kids we freed from Dragon City, they told me about a ship with scarlet sails... But you saw it too, right? Luke! It’s the middle of the desert. It was a mirage. An optical illusion. We’ve seen them before, remember? Everything okay, little lady? Sorry about that, Emma. There’s Mr. Tur Tur! Oh, what did I do to you, to make you take my house and my water, you cruel beast... No, no, no, no... Poor guy. What’s his problem? Mr. Tur Tur! - Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! Why are you following me, you monster? Do you want to eat me? If we don’t get breakfast, I can’t promise not to. It’s us! Your friends, Jim Button and Luke! That’s impossible. The Valley of Twilight caved in. No one can cross anymore. You’re just a mirage! Geez! It’s really you! My friends, Jim and Luke! You didn’t forget about me. Of course not. What’s going on, Mr. Tur Tur? A monster has occupied my house. A wild beast with a huge mouth that breathes smoke and fire! A fire-breathing monster? Sounds like a dragon. - Yes, exactly, a dragon! A terrible, fire-breathing dragon! We know how to deal with those beasties. Right, Jim? Jim! Jim! Oh, what would I give for a nice tidbit of terribly smelly lava. Nepomuk? - Spare me! You horrible giant! Nepomuk. - I’m a poor worm, I’m a poor worm... How come you know my name? - IVs me! Jim! Ha! IVs a giant trick. But you’ll never find me! Half-dragons are masters of disguise. Nepomuk, I can still see you! Huh? Luke! - Jim! It’s really you! Come on, let’s go! There’s a giant out there we have to pummel to pulp. Nepomuk? Now that’s a surprise. That’s him! Nepomuk, he’s a mock giant. In reality, he is not so big. He’s as scared of you as you of him. - He’s scared... of me!? A huge, terrible giant? He must think you’re a real dragon. Really? Do you think you could maybe be scared of me some more? Just a tiny bit? Because no one’s been scared of me yet, and that’s pretty terrible for a dragon. Oh, enough with the scaring. If you stay scared of each other, you’ll never be able to be friends. Friends? - Yeah, friends. You have a lot in common. Is that so? - Of course. You’re a dragon, who isn’t a proper dragon. And you’re a giant, who isn’t a proper giant. You both are... unique. When you’re unique, you’re usually also lonely, too. Oh, yeah. Please excuse me if I scared you. I’m inconsolable. - Oh, don’t worry about it. Your oasis is wonderfully hot and dry, I must say. Oh, thank you! But the sand can be a bit much, you know. You’re telling me! Can you hear my teeth grating? Personally, I prefer nice fresh lava. It’s tasty and healthy! I’d be glad to share a few recipes. Oh, yes, that would really interest me. There’s nothing better in the desert, than fig coffee with coconut milk, date cookies, pineapple rings and nut butter. And for you, my friend, something very special! Roasted desert sand! - Oh, thank you. Delicious. You should make this for our friends in Morrowland. Ms. Whaat would be thrilled. Morrowland? I’ve often pictured how picturesque it must be. Mr. Tur Tur? Would you like to accompany us? Me? Accompany you? To Morrowland? We urgently need a new lighthouse, so the ships don’t run aground in the fog anymore. With a light in your hand you could do that. You’ll never be alone again. And people won’t be scared of me? Morrowland is far too small. You could never be far enough away to scare anyone. So, what do you say? Dear friends, I... Yes! A thousand times, yes! Thank you. Thank you so much! - Good. We leave at dawn, when it’s not so hot yet. Good idea, Mr. Luke. The mirages have gotten worse recently. A mirage... Does it sometimes show the truth? - IVs shifty, Mr. Jim. It usually wants to lure innocent travelers to their doom. Sometimes it shows us the past, or reveals the future. Jim. The whole Mandalan fleet is after the Wild 13. Their days are numbered. But they’ve always escaped! What if they’re still kidnapping kids to Sorrowland? What? No! Stay away from Sorrowland! Since you beat Ms. Grindtooth, the dragons have been enraged. If they get their claws on you, they’ll roast you alive on a spit. Why did you leave your volcano, Nepomuk? They forced you, didn’t they? They... they found out I helped you... They wanted to know your names... and then they cursed me as a traitor and chased me away... They took my beloved volcano away from me... We have to make this right. He needs someplace safe from those monsters. A place that he likes... hot and dark... far away from Sorrowland The Gurumoosh Magnet Rock! - Yes. That’s brilliant, Jim! What? I don’t know, Jim. That’s a very big responsibility. Should we give him a go? - Yes! Please! Try it with me! I promise I’ll behave. Pretty please... WhaVre we talking about, anyway? - The Magnet Rock has no guard. A terrible rock in the wild Barbarian Sea. Terribly ugly. Very hot. Extremely dirty. I could dig my own lava well! Only the biggest, meanest dragons have one. Please, give me a shot. I won’t disappoint you, I promise! So it’s agreed. Yes! Oh, it’s so wonderfully ugly! Go ahead and explore. - Yeah. Oh, you have to see this! Yay! Fabulous! And how it stinks! You’re back! Sursulapichi! We’ve found a guard for the aquatic light! Lookie! What do we have here? - Nepomuk? Come here. I’m coming! You have to go back there... A water creature! A fire creature! - I’m a terrible and vicious dragon! Get out of here, you ghastly brute! - Oh, thanks for the compliment. Fire creatures are evil head to toe! Hold on, what’s wrong here? Hello? Fire and water are the worst enemies. Right. Like they taught us in school. Has either of you met a fire or water creature before? Uhh, well, ahh, umm.... Nope. Then maybe it’s time to make your own opinion. Our Emma couldn’t move without fire and water. And Nepomuk — wasn’t your mom a hippo? Ahhh... You’re half water creature yourself. There’s nothing greater than a refreshing bath, after all. Real dragons never bathe, got it? Whoops! Oh, I... help! I... I... I’m swimming! I’m swimming! I can swim! Hey! Ican do that too! Hey! With fins is unfair! Suddenly they’re no longer enemies. Waves! And even more waves! I’ll get Molly! - Do that. Eternal Crystal... May I, Mr. Dragon...? - What do I need it for? IVs yours. For 400 years, my love and I have searched for this. We can finally marry. Luke! The Wild 13 have kidnapped Molly! What? Impossible... “Djim and Luxs... treters... hu slood ms grintuth...” — that must be “slew” — “yu wil... pai 4 yur trribl did... a tousnd tmes ovrr. . The Wild 13 know about Ms.Grindtooth! Those guys get on my nerves. We’ll get Molly back. Count on it. But how? The Golden Dragon of Wisdom must be awake by now. She can answer everything. Excuse me, little lady. I know you want to find your beloved. We need a favor. Mr. TurTur must get to the tiny island of Morrowland. I’ll go get a carriage, and the fastest seahorses around! What about Urshurishoom? I’ve already waited 400 years. What difference does a day make? I’ll be glad to help. Farewell, you water creatures. And Nepomuk. Remember what was said: If any ship gets too close, you go down... and turn off the magnet. Don’t worry, Sursel-Ursel and Shroomy Usher will help me! Sursulapichi and Urshurishoom! - Like I said. Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye, my friends! Thank you for everything! You lost again! Jim! Your Majesty! - My dear, honored friends! Rescuer of my daughter! Ping Pong, my little buddy! How big you’ve gotten. Jim! Luke! Honorable engine drivers of a very distinguished locomotive! What brings you here, my friends? I can see from your faces that the occasion is not a happy one. The Wild 13 kidnapped Molly. It’s time to teach them manners. Our best warships are hunting those pirates, but they’re faster than the wind. Maybe the dragon can help us. How is she, Ping Pong? I personally watched over her sleep, Jim. At the Hour of the Monkey, when I was sent to bed, our best men took over the watch. I selected each one of them personally with the utmost care... Please bring us to the dragon. - Follow me, my friends! Come here, my friends, come here! Ms. Grindtooth... Golden Dragon of Wisdom... Please, wake up. Well, then. You’re here — those I call Master. Let the riddle be solved. You know our plans, dragon? who once made powerful empires sink into the sea, miss nothing that happens around the world. I know all. Then let us know where to find the Wild 13. Equip a ship with arms and paint it blue, like the waves of the sea. Thus camouflaged and hard to see, you will set adrift in the wind and current. Should you even once grow impatient and headstrong and take the helm, you will miss the place. The wind will guide you, until you spy the scarlet sails. Know the Wild 13 are merciless and have never been vanquished. They hail from the unconquerable fortress Stormeye, from the awful Land That Mustn’t Be, Will we win the battle? The winner will be vanquished, the loser will come out on top. In the eye of the storm, you will see a star, red as blood and five-pointed. Grab the star And make it your own. Thus will you find out the secret of your own origin. Luke... do you understand all that? No. But the dragon has helped us once before. We should trust her. Honorable friends. You need a ship, and arms. Your Imperial Majesty, with your gracious permission, I’ll take care of everything! Let’s give our dear friends all the help they need, Ping Pong. I’m hurrying! I’m flying! We’ll see it through together, lad! Let’s go get the Wild 13! No, old girl. This adventure is without you. We’ll bring Molly back. That I promise. Take care, little lady. Golden Dragon of Wisdom... I’ve never seen anything so beautiful in my life. Princess Li Si. Forgive me! I did not want to wake you. You were once a pupil in my classroom in Sorrowland. Now it is your fate to help your rescuer make what is odd even, as is written. Are you ready? That I am, Golden Dragon. Highly unusual. Papa! Papa, she spoke to me! She gave me a message for Jim. I don’t understand it, but with a little time, I can decipher it. You went to see the dragon again? Did you forget Itold you notto? I must go with Jim, no one else can deliver the message. I almost lost you once. A second time, my old heart couldn’t bear. This is about something much bigger! Let me join them. Please! Captain! From now on, my daughter is prohibited to board your ship. Any who let her aboard must be severely punished. As you wish, Your Majesty. I won’t let you stop me. You can’t order me around anymore at all! So stubborn. So headstrong. And so brave. Like her mother was. Stop that! The next man to start a fight will be keelhauled! Easy now. Easy? We haven’t moved for 3 days. We’re risking mutiny! If we change course even once, we’re lost. We have to do itthewaythe dragon told us. Who’s ever heard of that. Orders from a dragon. I’m the Captain, and I say: Enough of this baloney! No!! Murmuring manatees! The helm won’t turn. Someone blocked the rudder chain. Captain! Li Si! Princess! Your Highness. Four of my best men guarded the ship. How were you able to fool them? No matter. I’m taking command now. Didn’t you hear Jim, Captain? We must do what the dragon said. Turn the ship back. The Princess is going home. No! You won’t do that! You mustn’t ruin everything, now that the goal is so close! Jim! The dragon gave me a message for you. Ship in sight! There they are! The scoundrels who put babies in postal packages! They saw us, despite the camouflage. All hands on deck! Load cannons! Aye-aye, Captain. Fire! Their ship is armored! They all look the same. Molly! Luke, there’s Molly! Thirteen men on a dead man’s chest, yo, ho, ho, and a barrel of rum... Molly, we’re coming to get you! Drink and the devil had done for the rest... They’re in for a surprise! - Men, let’s show them who we are. Alley cop! Crush them. A star, red as blood... There, the kid! Come here, kid. See the stars spinning? Come here, you dirty rats! I’m going to cut you into pieces. It goes like this: left, right... and left again... Li Si! I’ll get you! Stop, you wench. Got you! Princess... So, big boy, your journey ends here. Hurry up, get moving! - No napping! Take it easy, little princess. I’m not your little princess. Be careful! We need her alive! The dragons are burning to get her. Hey, move! Forwards, down there. One after the other. No pushing. That one, tie him to the masts! I want to keep an eye on him. What a bunch of wimps! - Look at their long faces. We showed them, didn’t we? Get ready for the storm! Brothers! We’re going home! Thirteen men on a dead man’s chest, yo, ho, ho, and a barrel of rum... Drink and the devil had done for the rest... Raise the sails! Catch the wind, brother! They loved their rum and the sea and their gold, Until the devil locked them in the hold, They loved their rum and the sea and their gold... You’ve lost your mind! The typhoon will rip us apart! You’ve lost your mind! The typhoon will rip us apart! What a pleasant breeze. Jim?! Hold tight! The Land That Mustn’t Be... Molly! We’ll get you out of here. Don’t worry. Where are the others? Go ahead, pour. Don’t be stingy We won, we won! I’m the greatest! - Shut up! I’m the greatest! If we could only somehow tell ourselves apart. Drink up, brother! - Come, on! Down the hatch! The Princess could be our weapons master. And the big guy could help cook. Hey, you drunk blockheads! Leave some for me! Silence! Make way for your Captain! Go ahead, pour! Brothers! There’re lots of twins out there, even triplets and even quadruplets or quintuplets! But there’s no other darned gang of triskaidecatuplets like us anywhere else! Let’s drink to that, brother! - Hell, hail and thunderclaps! It pains my heart to think this is our last keg of dragon gargle. We captured one of the traitors who beat Ms. Grindtooth! The dragons will pay a fortune for him! Soon we can bathe in booze! Say, brothers... That young boy... didn’t he seem familiar to you? We delivered gaggles of brats to the dragons. Yes, but don’t you remember? We fished him from the sea in a small wood basket. It’s probably in the treasury. He had a letter with him. - As if you can even read! Each one of you meatheads only knows one letter! Just like you, blockhead. Say that again! Someone with guts. You can’t read. - Hear ye, hear ye. I’ll give it to you in the kisser. - You can’t read! Calm down. All right, all right. You’re the Captain. For now... Curses! Did a cannon ball hit you on your mangy head? Give itto him, Captain! Hey, Captain Little, want seconds? - Mutiny! Just you wait! - Grab the star and make it your own... You rat! So, that’s enough now. Devil, death and blue beans — enough of this, I’m the Captain! And where’s your star, you drunk jellyfish? I’m the Captain! I’m the Captain! - There’s only one Captain, and it’s me! I’m the Captain. - I’m the Captain! I give the orders here, ‘cause I’m the Captain now! I’m the Captain! - I’m the Captain! My beautiful new tooth! Hello, you rat! A little higher, Luke! Luke? Li Si? Can anyone hear me? - Jim? Jim! We’re here, Jim! I’ll get you out! What about the pirate gang? - They’re taking a nap. Luke, they still have the basket they found me in. It must be in their treasury somewhere. There’s a letter, too. Let’s go find it. What’re we waiting for? Captain, you guard the pirates! Jim! Li Si! Over here! So much treasure! The basket — they must’ve hidden it here somewhere! Found something! Find the letter. Jim. Are these...? - ... your parents! The letter. “Stranger, if you find this child, please know: Whoever finds and raises him in love and good faith will be richly rewarded for his or her kindness. Whoever harms or bodes him ill, however, will be robbed of all strength and power. For through this child the odd will be even...” “This is the secret of his origins: Three wise men came to see the baby Christ, to bring him presents. One of them was Black, his name was Casper. This king lost his great and mighty kingdom, when the dragons sank it in the sea. Ever since, the descendants of King Casper have roamed the lands, searching for their lost kingdom, known as Jamballa.” “This child is the last descendant of King Casper, and is destined to find Jamballa again. We place him in the hands of God, therefore his name should be PRINCE MYRRH.” Prince Myrrh... you’re a prince! Me? A prince!? That can’t be. - It says it right here. In black and white. I’ll be thunderstruck, my lad. Now you’re a real prince. And what a prince. I can’t move my arms. - Thunder, fire and brimstone! The Wild 13 have never been vanquished! Who was the devilish rogue who overcame us? It was me! A runt? - He’s got the star. All hundred hounds of hell! Had we had a guy like that as captain, we could’ve gone far! Silence, you tadpole! I say, they deserve to die. Make them shark food, like they planned with us. Go ahead, throw us in the sea! Right! Drown us like rabid dogs. Like rabid dogs. They took us and sold us to Ms. Grindtooth for a barrel of booze, Jim. They spread fear and terror. Yes, they did terrible things. But they also saved me as a baby. You overcame them, Jim. It’s your decision. I know what it’s like to be a nobody. Back then, when you stuck me in a box. Then I didn’t even have a name. But I found a family. They gave me a name. If it’s up to me to decide, then you shall live. What? And I’m going to give you names. - What’s he going to do? We’ve never had names. - He’s talking nonsense. You’re each getting a name that starts with the letter you can write. Write your letter down for me. From now on, your name is Antonio. Antonio? Hear that, brothers? Antonio! That’s me! Antonio, I’m happy for you. Antonio, can’t wait for what he names me. - Xaverio. Xaverio! I’m Xaverio! Isn’t that a wonderful name? Ignazio. - I’m Ignazio. Greetings, Xaverio. I’m Ignazic. Ignazio! - Ludovico. Ludovico. I’m Ludovico! Maximiliano! - Maxim iliano! I got the best name! Shut up! Mine’s the best! Forget it, mine’s the best. Maximiliano! UI rico. - Ulrico! I’m Ulrico! And you’re Fernando. - You hear that, brothers? I’m Fernando! T h eod crc. - Finally we can tell each other apart. Sebastiano. - Sebastiano... Emilio. Ru do Ito. Jim Button, we were determined to die without a word. We swore if we’re ever vanquished, that’s it for the Wild 13. We’re wild fellows. But we know what gratitude means. We give back your freedom, and shall take you to your homeland. When we’ve fulfilled our vow, we shall sail north, freezing ourselves in the eternal ice. No! Your fate is a different one. Jim. The dragon gave me a last message for you. Now, I finally understand it. Thousands of years ago, the rage of the dragons sank the beautiful land of Jam balla under the waves of the sea. Ever since, it has lain on the bottom of the sea, hidden from the eyes of mankind. In its stead stands the Land That Mustn’t Be, which goes against the natural order of things. There, in the bowels of Stormeye Castle... .you will find twelve copper doors. Open all twelve doors at once and the water will gush in, sinking the Land That Mustn’t Be. So that Jam balla can rise from the deep of the sea again. It is a deed full of terror, and only the twelve who thought they were thirteen possess the strength and courage to do it. What was bound will be free, what was foe will be friend, and what was odd will be even for all time. Then and only then will Prince Myrrh enter his realm. Twelve who thought they were thirteen? Hail and grenades, we are thirteen! That’s right! Twelve men and a captain. The captain was always one of you, so you’re still twelve. Cursed arithmetic... You heard the words of the dragon. Only you can make it happen. But it’s dangerous. It could spell your end. Let’s force them! -No! If they do it, then only by choice. So, brothers, what do you say? Good plan. - Agreed. Jim Button. We have sworn to take you to your homeland. And that’s what we will do! You there, prepare the ship! It’s a dead end. The twelve doors the dragon spoke of are down there. This gate has long not been opened. Men, get to it! Come on. Move it! Heave! Come on! Each of you, take a door! Return to the surface. There’s nothing for you to do down here. But... - He’s right, Jim. If it works, we’ll have to flee quickly. Don’t worry. The Wild 13 have only been vanquished once, and it was by a true daredevil. A little bit of water can’t hurt us. The Wild 13 can’t get out anymore. They’ll drown. Go on! Go ahead! - Luke! You aren’t going to... - You gave them lives. I’ll help them keep them. Besides, we’ll never get out without them. You’ve come a long way, Jim. Don’t stop now. I’ll take care of it. Brothers — heave, ho! Heave, ho! Heave, ho! The Land That Mustn’t Be has reached its end. The wind and sea are attacking it. - And they’re winning. On deck! Cast the lines! Heave, ho! Heave, ho! Heave, ho! Heave, ho! Heave, ho! Hold on! Luke!? - Luke! Luke, where are you? Your Majesty, they couldn’t have survived that. We should go home. - No, Li Si, no. We’re not going anywhere! Yes, my Princess. Luke. Don’t leave me alone. Luke! Grab tight, men! Stay together. Hurry up, up front! Luke! Luke! - Jim... Molly! Molly! Molly! Molly, everything okay? We did it! - Ill be darned! Pull me up! Set course for Morrowland! - Yes, Sir! Luke? Since we’ve left Stormeye Castle, you’ve hardly spoken a word. Oh, it’s no big deal. Friends tell friends everything. I learned that from you. Not so long ago, Morrowland was too crowded. Pretty soon, we’ll have too much room. What do you mean? Well, if you go home to Jam balla... what kind of Morrowland will it be, without you? I would never leave Morrowland, Luke. Not for a million Jamballas. Land in sight! Hail and cloudbursts, if that’s a tiny island, then I’m a flea. Impossible. We must be off course. Our course is spot-on! I checked it myself. Luke! That is... • •• Morrowland. This is how the dragon predicted it. The Land That Mustn’t Be will sink and Jam balla rise from the sea, like the other end of a big scale. Jim, that’s Jamballa! Move! Ms. Whaat? Mr. Sleeve? Emma! My good old Emma! Did the Imperial galleon bring you back? Wait, old girl. We have a surprise for you. Make room for the little one. It’s really pretty here. Spiffy hamlet. - What’s that for a thing? Hey brothers, look over here. Jim? Jim! It’s you! Jim! Is it really you? There was an awful earthquake and we all hid here. Mr. Fever, do I have a sleeve? Freeloaders! Bootcaneers! Pirates! And they all look alike! - It must be a mirage! Clearly a very rare phenomenon for which science has no explanation yet. Oh, that is, yeeas... nasty. Seize them! - Brothers! Draw your arms! No! - No, don’t Jim. No! Put your weapons away! Where is my daughter? Papa! - Li Si! You mustn’t be afraid. They won’t hurt you. Your Highness! They aren’t the Wild 13 anymore, the Terror of the Seas. They’re our friends now. - Yes. Right. We would’ve been lost without their help. It’s the truth, Papa. Do you trust me? Weapons away, brothers. You were just lucky again. Ms. Whaat? Your Majesty! I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have run away. - No, Li Si. I realize, I should beg you for forgiveness. You did what you had to. You’re braver and stronger than I ever was. I’m very proud of you. And your mother would be, too. Begging your forgiveness, ladies and gentlemen, could someone tell me what’s going on? It’s a long story. It’s yet another little whimsicality. Our Jim is a prince. He’s finally found what he’s looking for: The Land of Jamballa. Or should we call it “Jimballa”, Your Highness? Cut out the nonsense, Luke. I’m Jim. Forever. Should I give you a few tips, Jim? From King to Prince? Who wants a piece of cake? Me! That’s a wonderful idea, Ms. Whaat. Mr. Tur Tur, could you brew up some of your fine fig coffee? Of course! - With coconut milk? Mr. Sleeve? I need your help. My help... You could teach my friends, the Twelve Almost Invincibles, how to read and write. And while you’re at it, some decent manners, too. Can you do that? A slap in the face? Is that the best you can do? Thatil be a toughie. You’re the smartest person on Jamballa. There’s no one better than you. Mr. Sleeve. Morrowland. Mor-row-land All together: Mor-row-land - Very good! Arithmetic. - Oh no! Not arithmetic! Four and nine... Who did that? Maximiliano! To the blackboard, please. But I’m Ludovico. I’m Ludovico. - But I’m Ludovico... I’m Ludovico... Quiet! Maximiliano, I won’t say it twice. Ms. Whaat! Your Majesty! Your licorice candy! Finally! I’m coming, my dear. Good morning, Mr. Tur Tur! - Indeed, a very beautiful morning, my dear friends! Jim! And so, dear friends, the story of Jim Button and Luke, the Engine Driver comes to the end.
