EVERYTHING WAS DARK. THERE WAS ONLY THE SEA THE SEA WAS NOT WATER, NOR A THING, NOR A PERSON IT WAS MOTHER. IT WAS MEMORY. IT WAS THOUGHT. THE CREATION ACCORDING TO THE KOGUIS. PANQUIACO -Good morning. -Good morning. -Good morning. -Good morning. Where do I put the fish? Hold on. There? Cebaldo. Put me two kilos of fish. -Two kilograms? -Yes. Take the smallest ones. Look, Cebaldo. There are some small fish in here. Take the smallest ones and give them to the client. I have them here. Two kilograms. Do you like to eat scales? Do you like to eat scales? You have to do it like this and you take it out. You can't do it like that. You have to do it this way. Listen, Cebaldo. Bring the boxes, wash them and take them to the boat. Tomorrow we'll go to the sea. We need the boxes for the fish. On a sad afternoon in May, he went for a walk on the beach and he stumbled upon a dark-haired man who was a soldier, and he stumbled upon a dark-haired man who was a soldier. In the war, he killed his father. Soldier kids are like that, soldier kids are like that, soldier kids are like that, soldier kids are like that, soldier kids... Hello Cebaldo, I had been waiting for you. We had agreed to meet in the Plaza 5 de mayo. I was there, waiting for you. What happened? You are in my thoughts. Hi Cebaldo. We haven't heard from you. Today is the anniversary of your father’s death. Where are you? When are you coming back? We are thinking about you, Cebaldo. It’s cold. I lived six years in Russia. You lived six years in Russia? It's 30 to 40 degrees below zero over there. You see a lot of young people with no legs or arms. I thought they lost them during the war, but no. They lose them because they drink a lot. They pass out on the snow and don't feel a thing, they stay there. Many die. Those who are lucky do not die, but they get gangrene and then they get their leg amputated. In Panama it is always hot. In Panama it’s the same weather all year long. But it’s not like here. No, it’s hot there. He’s used to it. Are you used to this place now? How long have you lived here? Dear brother, I haven't answered many letters. Although I am not there, I never really left. I think of you. -Good night. -Good night. There was once a sailor who was shipwrecked on a desert island. As there was no way for him to return home, whenever he remembered his land, he suffered. He was sad. He began to dream of a new country. He started picturing the landscapes then the streets, neighborhoods, entire neighborhoods. All kinds of plants and animals. Then he began to picture the people. He pictured the place where he was born and this place became the land of his childhood. One night, the sailor woke up to an eclipse. He tried to remember, but he couldn't remember a thing. He had forgotten everything about his hometown. His hometown became a dream to him. FROM THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN PANQUIACO GAZED UPON THE TWO SEAS ONE DAY HE SAW THE VESSELS OF THE WHITE MEN ARRIVE TO THE CARIBBEAN SHORES OF PANAMA THEY WERE LED BY VASCO NUNEZ DE BALBOA WHO WAS IN SEARCH OF GOLD PANQUIACO AND BALBOA WALKED FROM THE DARIEN RAINFOREST TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN You have reached another place, an unknown place. A place where the trees bear ripened fruit and still others, with the whisper of the wind, have been blown away. The seeds have flown away with the wind. The seeds of these trees no longer live here. The seeds will return to their place. Do you remember where you used to sleep? Yes, I remember. It was over there, behind this. And mom and dad? Mom and Dad were over there. Was it there? People slept here. There were more beds. That was full of dad’s books. What about here? It was empty. Do you remember how Grandpa liked to tell stories? I always thought that they were fairytales. It was only later that I understood that they were the stories of our ancestors. When I left to Europe, you were all there at the airport. Our brother was there. Also mom and dad. Yes. Aunt Lucia didn't make it in time. She started crying because she could not say goodbye to you. By the time she made it to the airport, you were gone. We couldn't say goodbye. I still remember that day you left. Did you give him his medicine? The sick man should bathe with the medicinal plants. With the help of the medicinal plants, he may be able to recover his memory. To find the plants, you have to walk several days to the east. If you stay, you may find some of what you have lost. When you were a kid, you ran around the house. Later on, you left, and so did the kid in you. Now you are old. The days have passed and so have the years. You are not the same anymore... and you came back to remember. Finding your roots can help, but those memories you are looking for are no longer there. Your father passed away... He took a part of this place with him. That's why you feel this place is empty now. Search what you are trying to find here. Your father, your mother, your grandparents, your ancestors. Think about where you want to stay. Where do you want to die? You know what I mean? Look! What is that? It's a bird. It just caught a crab. -Caught it? -The bird. Crabs climb up the legs of bird unaware that they will be eaten. Birds also catch other animals sometimes they are by the shore and catch fish. Birds catch fish with their claws and fly away, but sometimes the fish is too heavy and the bird falls into the water. One day, a bird was looking for fish where a hungry alligator was on the hunt. The alligator lunged into the river after the bird who manage to escape, But the river was too shallow and the alligator broke his neck. He then died of hunger. That is why they say that you can also die of hunger. Do you know why this river is called Abudi? There used to be a lot of parrotfish. The river of parrotfish. That’s how the name originated. That’s what it means. Look at the mangoes. That’s where our family’s pantheon was. Grandpa is buried in Sugandi. Yes, Grandma too. They are both there. We have to go one day. There are many people buried here. There is a legend about two brothers when they looked at their reflections in the river, they realized that they were brothers. The day the brothers left town, they forgot who they were and where they came from. Their souls stayed in their reflexes. The reflection of the soul dwells in the water. Hi, Dad. I came back to see you. Can you hear me? I have been thinking about you... I brought you a drink, we can toast together. You know that I live far away from here and I have returned to find you. Maybe I will come back... Let's drink to that. Cheer for this. Cheer for this. I was born in Guna Yala. I was born in Guna Yala. My ancestors started the revolution for me. I was born in Guna Yala. I was born in Guna Yala. Let's all gather together to commemorate the hundred years anniversary of the Dule Revolution. In the midst of pain, we hear your name, but you are still not here. The sea and the mountains still remember you. The sea is waiting for you, wherever you are. The sea will always be your home. Can we heal ourselves after being sick? The land that we lose does not return, you have to let it go. Brother, it seems that these are my last words. So be it. What does all of this mean? It is as if everything that I had disappeared. What do I do now? Your soul has left this place and has gone far away. PANQUIACO AND BALBOA ARRIVED AT THE SHORES OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN ON THAT DAY BALBOA WAS VENERATED AS THE DISCOVERER OF THE SOUTHERN SEA On that day the sea wept and cried out: "Panquiaco, what have you done to me?" Panquiaco, in his grief, let the tears of the sea wash him away. Ever since, his spirit wanders between the two seas. In the cardinal directions. To the east. North. South. And west. When a person is sick, medicinal plants can help. The medicinal bath plants. The plants. The time has passed. The sun has left this place. Now, there is only darkness, and here, from the darkness, I invoke the souls of our ancestors, those who may help us. From the darkness, I await your souls. I summon you, I sing to you, and you are here. You have arrived to the place where you have been summoned. Your souls are now in the darkness. I invoke the spirit of Cacao, come help us. Souls, welcome to the darkness, help us in this bath to heal his soul. I offer my voice to save this man from illness with this medicinal bath, prepare him for his journey. When the sun rises again, grant your breath to his spirit. Receive the soul of this man.
