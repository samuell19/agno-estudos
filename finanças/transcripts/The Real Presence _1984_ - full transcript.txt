[Reading from Racine's Iphigenia] To the days of this unfortunate, [Other voices echo the reading] (This unfortunate. Unfortunate.) Heavens didn't bind the happiness of your destiny. (Happiness. Destiny.) Our love was misleading. (Our love was misleading. Our love.) And the rulings of fate, (And the rulings of fate.) want for this happiness to be the fruit of my death. Think, Lord, (Think. Lord.) think of the glorious harvests, that victory presents to your hands. This glorious field you all aspire to, if not sprayed with my blood, remains sterile for you. Such is the law of the Gods, as dictated to my father. In vain, deaf to Calchas, he had rejected it. From the mouth of the Greeks against me conspiring, their eternal commands were pronounced. Leave (Leave) - Hello Miss. - Hi Mister, please have a seat. Unemployed actor Adam Shaft visits the television studios to check, for his union, how many hours he and his colleagues worked on an interactive videodisk, precisely made to promote the next theater festival in the city of Avignon. He was earlier granted permission to examine the videodisk with technical assistance from a young lady, made available by the direction. In this videodisk, he can see himself arriving in Avignon. Obviously, he never took this train, and never set foot in this city unknown to him. Can we make anything appear on the screen? No. Can we make the same thing appear on the screen, but nicer? Yes. Tell me, can we make appear on the screen everything we always wish we could live? As long as it happens in locations previously identified, with existing models and that it remains within the limits of applicable legislations. Stop me if I'm wrong... Does this mean we will never get paid for the scenes we filmed, where our real presence could be reasonably put to doubt? If we paid you, we would have to admit the real existence of possible worlds. - Hello. - Hi. - Are you OK? - Yeah, and you? Oh yeah, but it's hot today. - Is it often hot like that in Avignon? - It's worse today. Tell me, how is the festival? Are there interesting things to look for? Of course, as usual... I'm actually waiting for someone now... - Am I bothering you? - No. There are a few shows I want to see, but I heard they're all sold out. So I'm looking for tickets now. Some of my friends play at the Off festival. Pascal Ébriel, you know him? He plays at 'Grenier à foin'. - No you don't know? - No. Oh wait. - I'm sorry, I'm bothering you now. - No, no, it wasn't him. - You still have that house in Avignon? - Yes. When do you want to come? I have a room for two days. It would be really convenient to come afterwards. I'd like to stay a few days more. Lots of theater people to meet. Fine. I really like what they do at 'Grenier à foin'. That's the kind of stuff... I'll take you if you want to. Ah! I'm sorry... Oh! Hi! It's hot today. How are you? I'm happy to see you. - Lots of people here. - So many people... it's impossible. We'll have to do this in the winter when it's less crowded. You think so? I don't know if winter would be good for Avignon. Because now... It's really not of much use. I disagree, I think there's a lot of good things in the summer. It's hot but it's nice. The weather's good, but the crowds... it's of no use. I'm sure it's of no use, with regards to your project. - Are you also waiting for someone? - Yes, but I don't think they'll come. - We go together? - Yeah, let's go. Unemployed actor Adam Shaft recognizes the dialogues he improvized when shooting but he is surprised to hear himself, also say things he doesn't remember. He finds it hard to focus, shocked as he is that he can't recognize the way he walks. Well, that's not... not really necessary... Really? So how do you do? You just go talk to people and you see what happens. You listen. You heard about the guys who play at 'Grenier à foin'? 'Grenier à foin'? Nope. They're really good. It's a young troupe of people who don't have much experience. But they have substance. They often work with material not coming from written texts but textual elements they took from anywhere, in the streets for example. Montage? They do kinds of montage, they start with a real sound... Literary mechanics, some kind of literary mechanics. If you like. I'd say it's closer to single mechanical machines. Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah. Literary in that the text is played in continuity. Meaning that the recorded text is re-edited, rearranged in a certain way. They rework the substance of the recorded text. And after that, they throw away the recorded text, and rework it. But this, they've been playing this each year for 10 years now, no? - No, that's not them. - Oh, that's not them? You know, there's barely 10% of recorded images for which we had to use... the real presence of living models like you and me. All other images are deducted either by combination or analogical simulation. I mean that they're not taken into consideration for the salaries of the artisans. Unemployed actor Adam Shaft watches himself visiting a festival that has not yet taken place. And attending shows that are still only in rehearsal. Thank you! Director: Jean Pierre Vincent (Rehearsal) Oh, there's François. François! François! François! Imagine our city. Picture it in the bright light of a Winter morning. François! François! See the high arrow of the cathedral church, pink in the blue sky. The banners that flap against the white towers of the castle. - Imagine our city. - François! Admire the mosaic glimmering of the Opera's cupola. And the exact proportion of the victory's column, mounted by a winged and golden spirit. You see, there's a projection, on the mouth, of lips... of moving lips. So the actor who speaks the text... It's not a recorded voice. It's the true voice of the actor. And the voice is always perfectly in synch. It's extraordinary. For 2h, the synchronisation is absolutely perfect. All of the Macbeth characters. All the Macbeth characters absolutely in synch. It's really phenomenal. And the audience... It's as if the audience was... You see, like the body of the head making a phone call. As if every spectator was like a cell... Like a cell... no, like an organic cell. And so, when people are leaving... And when people are coming back, there's... yes, there are people coming back, yes. There's a flow. It's like blood circulation. You see, like blood circulation. It circulates... And then it flows out... It's because the head which makes the phone call is cut off. So you see, blood flows out. Absolutely remarkable. Absolutely. Ok. There's one thing I didn't agree with. It's when he put Lenin's mausoleum in the throat, in place of the tonsils. That was... When young communicants sing "L'international" in front of it... It's been done before. You know... It's not worth doing. As for the rest, the thunder strokes, the tangos, the moving trains, the helicopter... And the stunt... Yes, the stunt. Not the stuntmen, the stunt. The Niagara. The Falls, you know. Not my cup of tea, you see... But it's still impressive. Impressive. Sorry Miss, but here I need an explanation. We will have to stop. Excuse-me but you make me say things I've never said. But it's simple. To me it's simple anyway. When you, your voice, it has an accent, it has a vocabulary, so when you speak, it creates a mass. A sound mass. There. So this mass, when the computer analyses it, it thinks. It has a mind of itself. It's a little alive. It speaks. It tells you things. But it doesn't tell you things you necessarily have thought before. It can tell you other things. It can tell you things that are exactly opposite to what you think. You can say "I like nighttime" and it can say "I don't like nighttime". - You see. - Yes, I understand. Well... Louis? Where is he #hiding? Tonight, Adam pays a visit to his friend the actor Louis Lalumière. Ah Louis! He finds him in a pitiful state. Are you ok? You look awful. You're unwell? The scenes you're looking at are created by the combination of the sound mask and of the gestural mask that we call sweeper. These images act accordingly to the rules of the story which from now on we will call the "world". Louis, can you hear me? In this world... - Can you see me? There are reiterative elements which we will call "echos". You really don't look well. And new elements... - Did you call a doctor? That we should thus call... - Me? I'm better than ever. Explosions. You're burning up. What an honor. You really shouldn't go out. Go out? But it's in here that we stay outside. Everybody tells me there's nothing to go see anyway. You truly don't understand a thing. It's not to the theater I wanna go. It's in the streets. Yeah, it's been said a lot. It's been said that theater is in the streets. That theater is everywhere. Be careful with clichés. They often hide disturbing truths. That's been said too. That theater is everywhere, except where it is taking place. You think you're being ironic, but what you just said is essential and true. It's in the streets that it happens. But not always. You know, we often say these days... that it's a miracle to find a good theater show. Well, I say it's true. But... in the literal sense. Now I'm very surprised. I came to recognize what was obvious: The only theater show worthy of that name is a miracle. What do you mean exactly? Lourdes. Oh ok, you mean that what we need is an authentic popular theater. Absolutely not. I see, you want to talk about religious theater. Euh, no... about outdoor theater. No. I believe in a theater of apparitions. Just like that. I believe in apparitions like you... and me. We're not apparitions. No, we exist. What's wonderful with theater is that the actors are there for real. Sometimes. Sometimes. The intensity of the argumentation imposes on the actors a breath vicinity that can only lead to germs being shared. From now on, the disease... - I have to go. will live in the unemployed actor's lungs. - Are you staying? Adam Shaft - Make yourself at home. Since I'm alone, with no one listening, and since monologue is my favorite theatrical method... How could I resist the urge? Everything is theater, on stage, sure, but backstage too. In the streets, but also in houses... Closed. [Maisons closes = Whorehouses] Never again. Everybody acts in front of his neighbours. But also in front of those who stay hidden. Not wanting to be seen. They also play for those who will never be able to see. And again, they play for the spectator who hides within himself and who only ever shows up to become an actor himself. To play for himself, his only audience, in a spectacle devoid of meaning. There is never an audience more cruel and more unstable. Such an audience can only appreciate total acting, which cancels itself through the movements it unveils. It's to haunt the audience that I will play tonight. And, following up on his words, unemployed actor Adam Shaft enacts his first suicide attempt. A few hours later, he is awakened by the warm breath of a beautiful woman. - Where am I? - The worst is over. The doctor just left. Now you need to rest. Sleep. Who are you? Béatrice Villon. But my real name is Ludmilla Essanine. I'm an actress. Thank you Béatrice. I have to go. Louis is very sick. He got worse in the last few hours. Ah, I forgot your book. What book? For God's sake... It's a theater play. The Great Theatre of the World. You held it tightly in your hands when I met you. Lying on the carpet, stained with blood. The Great Theatre of the World. Once upon a time, another time, a young lord named Eusebio of whom the birth remained a great mystery Pa-pam, pa-pam! He fell in love with Julia, the daughter of a jealous lord. He managed to see her in secret, and they sent each other letters. But Julia's brother found the letters and confronted Eusebio. During the fight, Eusebio killed Julia's brother. You cry? You mustn't cry. Eusebio had his land taken away from him. And Julia-a-a-a, cloistered in a convent. Stealing for food and killing to stay alive, Eusebio became the leader of a group of bandits. One night, he got in the convent where Julia was confined, to kidnap her and take her by force. But while he was holding her tight in his arms, she drew a cross on his chest. Terrified, he ran away tigili-tigili-tigili. So in order to find Eusebio, Julia dared to escape from the convent. Here begins the end of the story. The jealous lord took with him an army and went against Eusebio's group of bandits. Eusebio got injured and... Child, what are you doing? I open the book. I'm bleeding! Blood flows through the story that feeds your dream. - So? - I have a text. Well I think I have a text. It's Calderon's The Great Theatre of the World. You know it? Yeah, yeah. So here's my idea... Theater... The play takes place in a theater. And that theater is the world. And you have to take into consideration that in those days people were still mesmerized to know that Earth was round, you see? Sphere was something really important. People were haunted by the concept of the sphere. So I thought of this process... In the courtyard of the Popes' Palace, we build a gigantic sphere. Transparent. Inside the sphere, another sphere. Black Like a huge eye. You see? And then the curtains close at the end and are like the eye's lids. We could have the curtains opening and closing during the play which would look like the eye was blinking. You see? The characters... eternal characters, God, the author, the world are on top of the sphere. I mean just above it. And mortal characters inside of it, at the bottom. You see? Yeah, yeah. It's good. It's very good. But you're sure that all this apparatus and material is necessary? Because these machines, you need to express them. No need to build them. It doesn't seem essential to me. To the contrary, people will just say "Ok that's a nice machine". But we won't see the eye. We'll see a nice machine. - But you understood that... - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's the idea of the rolling stone... - The idea of the sphere, etc. So not a good idea... Yes, yes, it's a wonderful idea. Simply consider getting rid of the whole apparatus. Keep the idea, but take out the apparatus. To keep it simple. 'Cause I like that idea. It's a strong idea. Original. Another idea. A long corridor, with on each side, a series of bookshelves: Alexandre Dumas, Shakespeare, The Bible. The audience comes in. We ask everyone to pick a book. At random. We then ask everybody to open their book. Still at random. Now everybody realizes that it's really one sole book. At this moment, by a computer process that needs to be developed, the speakers start to play the text that each member of the audience has chosen. It triggers an avalanche of words that mix up, which makes everybody realize their responsibility in the involuntary choice they just made. Why have actors then? Excellent question. I imagine that actors walk among the audience and slip into the pockets and purses of the audience members.. lead balls. Making people feel tangible physical heaviness. They feel tired. And then they realize that all of this is caused by the presence, in their purses and in their pockets, by the presence, of spheres. Yes, it's very good. It's a very good idea. But the whole light and sound elements seem impossible. In this whole apparatus, no? On the very evening, Adam decides to pay another visit to Louis Lalumière. Louis? About whom I'm starting to worry. Don't do this. He finds him in the company of actress Béatrice Villon. Don't do this. A thousand voices rush from my mouth. Cruel Eusébio! My soul gives up. I collapse! I don't know how to speak. I don't know... I don't know... I don't know how to speak! - Shit! - What happened? There was an interference, again. Let me see! I want to see his body! Let me see! Let me see death! Let me see life! My son is dead as much as Earth is. [unintelligible] When we see the interferences of images for a second time, they don't surprise us anymore. This time there is no image interference. If images interfere, it's mostly due to mutual compassion bringing about a didactic merging, perfectly calculated. All these images are simultaneously narrative and didactic. Of course this doesn't imply any effect of commentary. Above all, we must take into consideration what I would call paralleling. What I mean by that is some kind of ideological montage, if I dare say, between two sequences. Get up from that bed and I'll kiss your dreadful bones, and I'll insert pupils in your empty eye sockets, and I'll joyfully turn your common prose into anthems, and I'll clog my throat with your fetid dust, so I'll be just like you, a monstrous rotting carcass. Walk with me and squeak, and I'll believe you're smiling at me and I'll cuddle you. As my son. No! Everybody! You see me here. A poor old man twice miserable, mourning and overwhelmed by sorrow. You think that I'm gonna cry? No! No I won't cry! I have many reasons to cry, but this heart shall break in a thousand pieces - before you see my tears. - Father! Who killed this son for whom life was beginning? Who took this life away from me? Everybody says it's Eusébio! - Father! - You! Dare tell me his love was innocent! Dare defend the one who, by way of last letter, seizes your brother's body... Oh, oh, it hurts! I'm in pain! Do something! Damnit, I'm hurting! But do something, eh? - What do you want us to do? - I don't know, just do something! For a few moments, Louis and Béatrice become the spectators of actor Adam Shaft's performance. Then they give themselves to one another. Here they are at times spectators, at times actors of the pleasure they incarnate. Shutting themselves in the vicious circle of gazes. Submitting to the unfathomable caresses they quite clearly simulate without completely fooling the excluded third party, who remains in control of the situation. I think I found a different way of doing things. A simpler one. The audience enters a room where there are only mirrors. So people try to find each other in the mirrors. And coming from behind the mirrors, we hear the voices of the actors saying their lines. This should make the audience ascribe to the text the involuntary movements that they see happening in the mirrors. At some point, the mirrors become transparent. And the spectators realize that they are inside a gigantic sphere. Yes, but, why a sphere? Well I don't know, maybe because spheres are the stuff dreams are made of. Can we imagine something simpler, with a single mirror and only one actor saying the whole text? With a single spectator facing a single mirror. If need be, yeah, why not? The arrangement you are seeing now is the one I called "White sequence". Namely, the fictional system of all equidistant possibilities of stories that this videodisk can offer. But this one is interesting to me. This is not enough. One must wish for things to happen. What kind of things? It is not for me to tell. That they'd kill each other, for example. But it's been done before. Yes, but... Directed by Jean Pierre Vincent (Rehearsal) Despite his trouble breathing and a constant uneasiness he can't explain, unemployed actor Adam Shaft imposes on himself, to see a maximum of theater shows. Never less than five plays per day. In the morning, he devotes his time to meetings he judges essential in order to finance his project to stage The Great Theater of the World. Nobody here? You remember? Tonight, back at Louis Lalumière's place, he meets his worst enemy's ex-wife. I remember very well. Louis t-t-t... Nobody's home? You think. Everybody's here. Don't be surprised if you hear screaming or insane bursts of laughter, this is the place. They're sick, both of them. Béatrice... She's been with us since yesterday, and if I understand correctly, we should consider you as our guest too from now on. Oh dear Bichotte, that's what you say... I'm only repeating what's being said. Thanks in advance. Everything's been set. Your room is on the left. Right beside mine. Go to bed right away. You don't look so well either. I'll come see you in one hour. Bichotte... Are you unwell? I feel dizzy. It feels like my teeth will fall out. I'm afraid to smile. As for me, I have a sore throat. It keeps getting harder to breathe. And I'm coughing all the time. Me on the other hand, I have intestinal spasms. My tongue keeps getting dry. It burns. On top of that, I have a terrible testicular inflammation. Be careful, it's the same disease. But it unveils to each of us what we carry inside. It doesn't matter. All these suffering brings me closer to my character. Can we know which character? Iphigénie. I've been working on this character for the last 10 years. But it was already working in me way before. Day after day, I rebuild Iphigénie's life. I know everything about her now. Almost. Within the next 20 years, I'll be Iphigénie. But it will sadly be too late. I won't be her age anymore. It's a tragedy. Don't you think? Please help yourself. Bichotte, it seems the cutlery wasn't handed out correctly. It was intentional. But if it's a problem, you can put it back yourself. It won't be necessary. After all, we can very well all eat with our fingers. That's what I like best! Oh! This must be itchy. Isn't that itchy? - Yes. - Isn't that itchy, here? It's happening again. I feel again this urge to scream. It bothers me because I'm afraid the neighbors will hear. It didn't disturb you too much, the screaming? You all seem very sick. Me I'm fine. I'm fine. Very fine. All this growing hair... I'm sorry. It's disgusting. And it itches, it itches so bad. It itches. I'm sorry. It's disgusting. Doesn't this remind you of anything? No? [They quote De LaFontaine] A sickness which... Spreads terror. A sickness that... the furious heavens invented to punish Earth's crimes The plague - to call it by its name Could Pluto's ferryman enrich Waged war on beasts They died not all, but all were sick No hunting now, by force or trick, to save what might so soon expire. No food excited their desire Nor wolf nor fox now watch'd to slay The innocent and tender prey. The turtledoves fled So love and therefore joy were dead. The lion council held, and said 'My friends, I do believe This awful scourge, for which we grieve, is for our sins a punishment Let us our guiltiest beast resign, A sacrifice to wrath divine. Perhaps this offering, truly small, may gain life and health of all. No. Don't do this. No. This door is forbidden! What's happening? She can't do this. Behind this door, three persons killed themselves already. Interesting. When? It's an old story... Open this door right now! It's an order! Somehow I knew this hall existed. But I guess something in me suppressed that memory. So this mythical room everybody's been looking for for years, and in which nobody believed anymore, really exists. I guess it does. Where is Béatrice? There. What is she doing? Nothing. What is she playing at? It was bound to happen. It was wonderful to be alone in an empty theater. As everywhere around us, theater is done in unlikely places, crowded, stinking. It was wonderful. An empty theater, with nothing, nobody. Nowhere. Just a theater. It's over now. It was bound to happen. The next day, unemployed actor Adam Shaft decides he should move. From now on, he will live in the theater. At once a place for work and for rest. Gradually, the other actors would do the same. Where am I? Here? Or there? And if I'm elsewhere, who is speaking here? And here, I know, is a theater stage! - Theater! Nevertheless, from this stage turned into a theater dressing room, Theater! I can watch myself play in The Great Theater of the World! - Nobody's home? - No! Me, spectator, I play on stage the actor who watches himself play! Theater! Who's more real? Me on stage seeing the one who's prevented from meeting me? Or me... Playing, concealing my true vacuity? Who's more real? He sits in the body of a welcoming God. The forest shakes him in its branches. Even as wind pierces him, he becomes... Volume! An arrow to be! - Hello Bichotte. - You remember? Bichotte Curry. Bichotte Curry! Bichotte, Bichotte... Bichotte. Bichotte. Since we're all here, waiting for the supreme act of my real presence on stage... Here am I, forced to commit the probationary act. And, following his word, unemployed actor Adam Shaft performs... Béatrice, don't do that! Don't do that! His second suicide attempt. Silence please! I'm dying! Béatrice? Béatrice? Béatrice? This joyful time fills me with horror, pleasure and delight. [He quotes Racine's Iphigenia] Never before a day seemed as lethal. Global dissension had already blinded everyone And given battle its macabre signal. In this awful fight, your frightened daughter Saw Achilles on her side, and an army against her. But even alone, Achilles, furious, terrified the army and divided the Gods. The astonished soldier said that from a cloud, Diane came down to the pyre and that through its blaze she took to heavens our incense and our vows. Everyone rushes, everyone's gone. In this shared happiness, only Iphigénie mourns her enemy. From the hands of Agamemnon, come and receive her. Come. Achilles is dying to see you again, Madam. Both of them now mature and wise, Are ready to confirm their noble union. [Achilles from Iphigenia] Come, Madam, follow me. Fear neither the screams nor the helpless crowd of the people gathered around this tent. Appear. And with no need for my blows, these tumultuous waves will open before you. Patroclus and other leaders who walk after me, From my Thessalians bring you the elite. All the others, gathered near my flag, offer you from their ranks the invincible rampart. To your persecutors, let's oppose this asylum. Let them try to get you from Achilles' tents. What, Madam, is that how you support me? It is only with tears that you answer me. Do you still trust such weak weapons? Let's hurry. Your father has seen your tears before. [Iphigenia] I know it well, Lord. That's why now all my hope lies with the mortal blows I will receive. You, die? Ah! Stop using this language. Did you consider that oath joining us? Did you consider, to cut through unnecessary speeches, that Achilles' happiness relies on your days? To the days of this unfortunate Heavens didn't bind the happiness of your destiny. Our love was misleading. And the rulings of fate want for this happiness to be the fruit of my death. Think, Lord, Think of the glorious harvests that victory presents to your hands. This glorious field you all aspire to, if not sprayed with my blood remains sterile for you. Such is the law of the Gods, as dictated to my father. In vain, deaf to Calchas, he had rejected it. From the mouth of the Greeks against me conspiring, their eternal commands were pronounced. Leave. To your glory, I bring too many obstacles. Your oracle's faith comes from yourself only. Notify Greece that her promised hero has come. Turn your sufferings against his enemies. Priam turns pale already. Get out... Pfff. It's not possible... That's enough already! - Come, everybody! Come! - Look, that's her. That's her. - Who's that? - That's her. When he wakes up, the actor finds on his nightstand a newspaper clipping he must have read before going to sleep. The article is about a murder. A young woman was found dead, in an inexplicably abandoned theater. He understands that the dream that was haunting him for years was only a theatrical performance. Subs by MemorialBBQ
