Well Walter, here it is almost summer again. I was saying to your mother the other day it hardly seems that winter's over with, let alone spring. - Busy day? - Well, you know... I spoke with Dean Fawcett. He says he can't do a thing about your College Board exams so you will have to take them over around the end of the year. Are you listening to me? I don't understand how you could fall asleep in the middle of your exams. Have you made any plans for summer? - Have you made just any plans? - No. Look at your sister. According to Mayherhoff, she could become quite an oceanographer. - You've had asthma all day? - It's the cat. - You're not on drugs are you? - No, it's the cat. - What's in your hand? - A turtle and an Almond Joy bar. Walter, I don't understand you. You carry around all these strange pieces, and yet you read Fortune magazine. You know I used to read Fortune magazine. Thoroughly enjoyed it. I couldn't tell you now why I cancelled the subscription. What about going back to Dr. Rossen? Your mother spoke with him, you know. It's been agreed you won't have to lie on a couch this time. I'd rather not. - Well you're not spending your summer in movie houses! - I won't. Excuse me. Yes? Yes, this is Lionel Elbertson. Oh good, I'll hold on. By the way, Walter, did you see The Times today? They called "The Identity of Man" a triumphant achievement. And referred to me as "our great historian." Hello, Lyle! Thank you, it was a fair review. No, not at all, I was just chatting with brother. Oh he's perfect, just perfect! Well he's been planning his summer. What? No, he hasn't decided. Why? What's going on in Spain? Oh, to learn Spanish. Is your boy going? Lyle, for God's sake, save a place on that tour for brother, do you hear me? Yes, he'd love touring Spain. Elbertson! Elbertson! Elbertson! Nine hundred twenty six. Elbertson! Elbertson! - "Novecientos veintiseis". 926. - 926. En espanol, Elbertson. "Novecientos veintiseis." "Novecientos veinti -six." - You've got to try harder, Elbertson. - I know. You have to try harder. - You have to... - No! You say, "I have to work harder." - "I have to try harder". - That's good, Elbertson, let's go. Elbertson, near the village is Manzaneras. - "Manzanares", what does it mean, David? - "Apple orchard". Okay, close to the village of Guadarrama, 25 kilometers from Madrid... It's three o'clock. Now we are all going to leave this lovely town. And take the scenic route through the historic landscape of Castilla la Vieja. I'm sure you'll all enjoy this romantic trip. Everybody is ready? Please go back to the seat on the coach. Elbertson! Elbertson! Where is Elbertson? Elbertson! Elbertson! What are you doing? Stay! Don't worry, Carl. I just can't ride anymore, Carl! Wait a minute, Elbertson! Wait a minute! Come back! You can't... What about your bicycle? Mr. and Mrs. Clark? Colonel Duncan and Mrs. Duncan please...? Mr. Elbertson! You're lucky, you have a room for tonight. Miss Fisher... Miss Fisher? You have a letter. Mr. and Mrs. Flood... - What would you like? - A water, please. Still. Thanks. - Starling... you like it? - I'm not too familiar with birds. I have a fish. Fish are good, but they are so quiet. I will do you one of my favourites. A very difficult bird. Lark of the meadows. - Frightfully good! - You would like perhaps for yourself a bird? No, thank you. I really ought to be getting back. You make me think to think so much of my Maria... I'm awfully sorry. Hello? Who is that? Mr. Taylor, this is Miss Fisher. Yes, I'm calling you all the way from Spain. Would you ask Auntie Vi to come to the phone, please? I'm sorry... I didn't hear. What did you find? Your teeth? No, I would never have thought of looking in there. Could you get Auntie Vi? She's not? Well could you get Auntie Gladys for me? Ask her to leave Mr. Phillips. Mr. Phillips can sit up beautifully on his own in the bath. No, not as well as you can, but he can sit up. Will you go up and hold onto him and ask Auntie Gladys to come down, please? Thank you. Hello? Hello, Captain Bill. Yes, he told me he found them. Yes, in the piano. Very careless. No, Captain Bill, you're not going to die. I promise you. I can't call you every day and promise you. I'm in Spain, you see. Spain! Yes, I know you have a pain. We all have a little pain now and then. I bought you a lovely bottle of brandy. Is Auntie Gladys there? Auntie Gladys... Hello? Auntie Gladys, this is Lila. How are you? Hmm... Well, I couldn't ring you yesterday. I just wanted to know if everything is going smoothly. Oh, nonsense! Things won't be falling to pieces... I said things can't be falling to pieces. It's a bad line. It's just a very... It's very... very... How beautifully blue the sky... The glass is rising very high. Continue fine I hope it may, And yet it rained but yesterday. Tomorrow it may rain again. I hear the farmers need some rain. Yet, people say, I know not why... That we shall have... a warm July. Who is it? Who is it? Wait a moment. Life, it comes like a bird! And life is good and then the bird flies off. - With all my best compliments, senorita. - I already told you I don't want a bird. In my heart it was so much light, so much esperro with Maria... - Really? - And then it comes to me the sadness. Maria Rojas Olivera has been wrong to me. But I still love her now. And so I go to the soldiers who tooks her from me, Maria come between us, and with a piece of glass... she cuts my heart in two! No, don't cry for me, senorita. And now, senorita, you are a new sparrow who fly into my life from London! - No, Bournemouth, actually. - Bournemouth? Bournemouth! A new sparrow from Bournemouth who comes and glow on me! I insist that you leave this room at once. But I have only begun. I didn't say nothing yet. I can do the yellow-headed blackbird! Who was that one on the balcony? Please sir! Would you please take your bird and go? - You don't want me? - I don't. But I'm sure somebody does. Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed your little cup of tea. And now we are leaving the Valley of the Olives. Please, follow me. Olives you know means "aceitunas". By the way, Jesus Christ came here with his disciples... And here he spent the night of his agony, in Nicholas Ray's superproduction, "The King of Kings," starring Jeffrey Hunter. Please! Does anyone know English? Please! Hey... There's... somebody's missing. Please! Please! Miss Fisher? Yes, I seem to be locked in. - Do you speak any Spanish? - No, absolutely no Spanish. - I'm trying to learn. - I tried and I'm still trying. - "Hola"... - Is "hello". Do you understand "como se llamo usted?" - It's "what is your name"? - Elbertson, Walter Elbertson. I really think we should try to learn some Spanish, don't you? "Me athe mucho gracias." Can you say that? "Me athe mucho gracias." - "Me athe mucho ..." - "Me athe mucho gracias". That means, "It's terribly funny." "Me toma el pello". "No aquanto el calor". "No aquanto el calor." - "Calor aquanto..." - "No aquanto el calor". - "No aquanto el calor." - "No aquanto el calor." It is getting light. "Ameneste", or if it is getting dark. It is "ospurete". Can you do that one? "Amenethe.. Ospurete". That's very good. We can move on to... Lunch. "Almuerzo", masculine. "Merienda", feminine. A masculine lunch and a feminine lunch. But to eat lunch is "almuerzar". It is also "merendar". So many choices! Let's try "merendar". Say "merendar". - I don't want to try to say "merendar" - I beg your pardon? I don't want to "merendar" And I don't want to "almorzar". I don't want to "hasta" and "tomare", I don't want to do it any more. I don't want to do it any more. Very well. - I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. - You didn't. Look, I seem to make it very uncomfortable for you, Miss Fisher. So I think I could talk to the driver and he could change my seat. As you wish. I know I make it uncomfortable for you sometimes and you're sort of down. - And I really don't mean to make it uncomfortable. - Down? In what way am I down? - Do I act 'down'? - Not exactly. You're nervous sometimes, and I think I make it worse for you. Worse for me? What do you mean? How am I nervous? I just wanted to say I was sorry if I made you uncomfortable. - You hear me whistle, don't you? - No, I don't hear you whistle. I know I whistle. I am aware of that. Oh well... we all have our tics, like my father sucks on his pipe all the time. - You whistle. - And you wheeze. A little asthma. - You're very observant, aren't you? - I don't mean to pry. Well I too am observant. I have observed that one of your major tics is running away. Only since you've been to Spain, you've run away from a bicycle tour, And now you're going to run away again. - I was just changing my seat. - I don't think that is necessary. So far as I am concerned we are still "amigos". - Miss Fisher, I'd like to be an "amigo", but I... - "Amigo". - "Amigo". - "Amiga". You are "amigo", I am "amiga". "Amiga" is feminine. You are masculine. Who is it? It's Walter Elbertson. Are you alright? Yes, I just knocked over a lamp. Oh. Sorry. - Thank you. - That's alright. I just thought I heard something, And, being in a strange country... I thought I'd check. Seem to be locked out. I locked the door. You will have to ask the concierge to let you in. - Yes... - You have to say, "he perdido me llave." "Me llave"... This beautiful castle, ladies and gentlemen started to be built in the 13th century. By the Duke of Infantado, as a present to his wife. Unhappily, they never lived to see it completed. Please, follow me. Thank you. Please, this way. This place is one thousand fifty-five metres high... - I wonder if you can get to the top. - I shouldn't think so. - Do you want to try? - No. I'm gonna try. Wait! Here, let me, let me... I'll just check... OK! - Miss Fisher! - Yes. It's a really great view up here. It's great! - I'd really like to fly. - Oh don't. What are you doing? I'm playing a game. Children play it at home. It's called "five stones." Don't you play it in America? I never heard of it. You have to throw up five stones and catch them on the back of your hand. Then you pick them up one at a time. - I'm not very good at it. - Sometimes it's rather difficult. - You're pretty co-ordinated! - I'm having a good day. I'm having a good day. I'm having a really good day! "Buenas noches". You're hurting me! Walter, please stop! Walter, please! Walter, don't! Sit down. Please! I didn't mean to grab you. I know you didn't. - I mean, I meant to grab you, but I... - Please! Don't let's talk about it. Will you give me your hand? Walter. I don't want you to think that I go around grabbing people because I don't. I know you don't. Does it hurt? You'll have a bruise. I just thought you were very beautiful, that's all. And I think you're a very fine young person. It's just that... You and I, Walter, it's all so rather... inappropriate. There's a generation gap. I do understand... I think we should go half and half on paying for the wall. Gently... I think we better stop. Yes, I... - I think you're quite right. - Yes. - Buenos dias. - Buenos dias, senora. I wanted to know if you have a bus tour which is leaving Segovia. Yes, yes. - A bus tour of Spain. - Yes. Where to, madam? I don't really mind. Do you have the new brochures? Yes, we have this one that goes to Montoro. We have another one that goes to Soria. What time does it leave tomorrow? I don't understand, ma'am. I don't understand you. - Do you have anyone who... - Here? We're leaving now. Mr. Elbertson... How beautifully blue the sky... The glass is rising... Very high... Continue fine... And yet it rained but yesterday. Tomorrow it may rain again. I hear the farmers... need some rain. People say... I don't know why... That we shall have a warm... ...July. ...things bright and beautiful, all creatures great and small... ...all things right and wonderful, the Lord God... ...made them all. Hello? Hello, Miss Fisher. This is Walter Elbertson, and I'd like to talk to you for a moment. Would you wait just a moment? I was reading about the Spanish Revolution. Revolutions always make me cry. I came back because I want you to know that I don't think you're cheap. I definitely don't think you're cheap. If I made you feel cheap, I'm sorry. I understand how you must feel and I want you to know... I have a very deep basic respect for you and for the dignified... ... kind of woman that I know you are. Miss Fisher? - It's alright. - What's alright? Everything. - What's alright? - You're alright, you're gonna be alright. Of course I'm alright. It's alright, don't worry it's alright. - Stop saying that. - All right, I mean okay. - What are you doing here? - I came back. How did you get in? Well, you let me in, but it's all... I mean it's okay. - What's okay? - I don't know... you passed out... Mm? I passed out...? - You mustn't get the wrong idea... - Oh no, I won't. - I don't have any idea at all. - We all have our highs and our lows. Miss Fisher, I understand that, and... Miss Fisher? Miss Fisher, I came back because I want you to know that I do not think you're cheap. I definitely don't think you're cheap. If I made you feel cheap, I'm very sorry. I understand how you must feel and I want you to know I have a very deep basic respect for you. And for the dignified kind of person I know you are. You came back to tell me that? Well, to tell you the truth, I was worried about you. I sat on the bus and I had to come back, because I was worried and I... I had to know if you were alright. I mean, okay. You were worried about me? No, I thought of you being alone and it was really boring in the bus. To tell you the truth, some of those people drive me up the wall. Don't cry. I'm sorry, I can't help it. Oh listen, Miss Fisher, I understand. I mean, I don't understand exactly, but I understand about highs and lows. Honest to God, I've been through it. - My sister built her own cello. - Her own cello? Yeah... one time in the locker room somebody wrote on the wall, "Walter Elbertson was a child molester." I'm not a child molester. Honest to God I'm not! But I didn't know what to do about it. You see I understand these things. I've been to a psychiatrist, Miss Fisher, and I have asthma. And my father won the Pulitzer Prize. But sooner or later the sun comes up, the day comes up, Miss Fisher. Look, see? There's joy in the world! I don't know how to say it exactly, but being alive is miraculous. I'm not a religious person, but sometimes I wish I were. - Are you a religious person, Miss Fisher? - Yes, at Easter and Christmas. Miss Fisher, life can be our friend, it doesn't have to be our enemy. Things are good and some are not so good, right? Some are better, others are worse. Some are just so-so. None are perfectly good and none are absolutely bad either. But there is life, and love and the pursuit of... We have to go out into the world, and find it. We cannot have it perfect, so we have to take the bitter with us. We have to smile in the rain and be cheerful losers, because it's there, Miss Fisher. It's there to be lived, and I think we have to grab it, Miss Fisher! Walter, please stop talking. You're making my headache much worse. Hello. - Hungry? - A bit. Thank you. I think that you should know that... ...whatever you saw last night has nothing to do with you. The soup's not very good, is it? I think the soup's very good. - Where's the bus? - Well, there isn't any bus. - What do you mean 'there isn't any bus'? - That is our bus! - What do you mean, 'there is our bus'? - I rented that. It's our own private touring bus. - You rented it? Why? - For us! It's the perfect size. You can take that thing anywhere. There's a sense of propriety involved in certain relationships. While I always assumed we were acting in an appropriate manner at appropriate times I wonder now, if we were to travel about together in that ...thing if it wouldn't look a bit obvious? - Who's going to care? - Well I suppose I care, Walter. Therefore I think that we can go on being "amigos", but we must stop being... "amores". Why do you always have to make everything so impossible? You're making a scene. Come on, why do you have to take off in a tour, when we can take off in this? I shall call a policeman... Haven't you gotten the message yet? We'll make our own tours. We'll go anywhere we wanna go, see anything we wanna see. We're free. We're coming alive, we're talking to each other... For the first time in my life, I am able to talk to somebody. And you haven't got any right to go back to some timetabled tour that makes you sit around all day and go into some dark hotel room all night. My God, what do you want to go back to being alone in the dark for? You're a lady that cries at revolutions, not the dark! So why don't you revolt? I mean, look what I've got for you! I've got for you an entire revolutionary war machine! Look at it, it's beautiful, it has everything! It has a place to sleep, it has stoves, it has a toilet! You are a very determined young man. Yeah. Yeah, I am, aren't I? I think I'll have to fix this window in the morning. Magic! There you go. - Open the door! - Yeah, there's a lock here. Please open it! It's not bad, really, you know. It's just... a little imagination... Fix it up. Look, we can even see the stars. I think it's best if we close it now, though. It's locked. It's broken. Good thing we have an umbrella! I'll go and get the bags. Can you open the door? The door's jammed. - What's wrong with the door? - It's jammed. - Is there a window open? - They are open. Aha... oh great. There you go. - Are you alright? - Yeah, I'm fine. Just gotta clean it up a little bit. I have a poncho. Why don't you put this on, while I fix it up. The lights are going! - Yeah, it's... - Can we fix them? - Where did you get this thing? - Oh, I got this from a marine. - Where? - A marine. Why don't we just fix this bed up here... Put the bed down between the seats and you can use the cushions for... This is just really neat... Try. Well, put everything on... What's wrong? That's alright. We can just stay here and listen to the rain. This is really perfect. - Walter, please! - What? I'm not in the mood, we have to mend the place. Everything is soaking wet! Yeah, but we don't have to do it until the morning. There is a time and place for everything, Walter Will you please mend the door, mend the lights, and try and get dry. Just one more kiss. - Now, go and mend the door, please. - Alright. Alright, I'll do it. Where's the towel? Give me the towel. I need some clothes... I'll put this on... No, that won't do. Put the suitcase on the roof. Put the suitcase. Walter! What on earth are you doing down there? Do you know what you are? You are a big pain in the ass! Now is no time to be funny. Isn't that the most... Look at that embroidery, it's lovely! - No, Walter, no. It's much too expensive. - I know. I know it costs too much, but I just want to see it. He doesn't mind. - I need to get some trousers. - We won't buy it. Where's the pants? - Walter, put it back! - We need some pants! - No, Walter, put this back. - I bought it! Hola, echo! Hola, amigo! Hola, amiga! Hola, echo! We're on our way to La Mancha! And we might go all the way to China! Lila, are you hurt? Are you hurt? Are you alright? - Does anything hurt? - I'm perfect... I will help you. I am Don Jaime de Mora y Aragon. You needn't worry. She will be safe in my house at the castle of Aragon. No bones are broken. He gave her something, she will sleep until morning. She's a little stunned. - What did he give her? - Sleep. He gave her sleep. What a very special beauty she has, this woman. What is her grace? What's her what? - I'm sorry. What is her name? - Fisher, Lila Fisher. Lila Fisher ...well, we will go you and I. We will go and let her sleep. You needn't worry, I will take great care of her. Buena noches. Buena noches. Lila... - It's all so strange... - What is strange? Well, being here. And falling down, and you carrying me. - You did carry me, didn't you? - Yes. - On a horse? - Yes. - It's so embarrassing... - You must not be embarrassed. The flowers should be embarrassed, you look so beautiful. - The robe, does it fit? - Beautifully, thank you. Your mother has exquisite taste. My mother has no taste. I pick it for her. I love to show my gold. My gold French prostitutes. I love to show my gold. That's Spanish for "bring me the basket of fruit, please". "Would you bring me the basket?" is "podria traerme?". - "Podria traerme"... - But your Spanish is very good... - My Spanish is terrible! - It is absolutely charming. It is only terrible that you waited so long to come to Spain. It is not fair that you have kept us waiting so much. The boy! Would you please join us? Hello. Walter... - Walter, how are you? - Fine. Fine. I... I had a fall. - Are you alright? - Yes I'm alright. - I hope you weren't too worried. - You will have a good, good breakfast. - I'm really not going to stay. - Please stay. Why do you have to go? - Here's your shoe. - Thank you. I know that it is important to eat for growing boys. No really, it's alright. - Are you sure you're okay? - Yes I'm alright. Please stay. Sit down. Why do you have to go? What do you have to do? I have some work to do. I have to fix the window on the trailer. Oh please wait for me, I won't be long. They're only washing... my clothes. It won't take long, really. We can go together. No, really - you stay here, have your breakfast and I'll see you later, okay? - Really, Walter! - No it's all right, I'll see you later. - Are you sure you're okay? - I'm perfectly alright, thank you. What are you to each other? Family? - Friends. - Ah, I see. So, we two are friends, and now we shall have breakfast. And perhaps then we will have dinner together. When the window is fixed, and you can come with Walter. Are you ready? Would you mind if I didn't go? I just don't feel like going. You can talk to him better than I can, you'll have a good time, and I don't mind. I mean you can go, you can have a good time. I just don't want to go. I intend to have a very good time. - Where do you live? What is it like? - It's very simple. - Do you live alone? - No, I live with my aunts. I live with my mother. Thank you. Would you cut my hair? - I beg your pardon? - Would you cut my hair? I'm awfully sorry, I'm afraid I don't cut hair. Would you like a balloon? Thank you. You must blow hard. It's very hard. - God bless you! - Thank you. Of course nothing in this room is more recent than the sixteenth century. Beauty is ageless. Do you appreciate carpets? I'm so happy you enjoy all my goodies... And now I will show you something that might interest you. This is my great-great-great grandfather. Do you see the resemblance? This is my mother's bedroom. When she's here... - Oh I see you like lace. - Lace? - And you're a lace and I love you. - Please, I'd rather you didn't! - You are divine! - It's awfully kind of you to say so, but... I will say it again. You are divine! - No, I forbid you... - Please forbid me, darling! - You mustn't! - I must! - You mustn't! - I must! You must not. I have a fatal disease! "Una enfermedad fatal." Hello. - What did you have for dinner? - Chicken. I was taking a walk and I suddenly realized that we've been travelling around a long time, you know. And I was thinking maybe we should sort of... reorganise the plans a little. And start heading back in the direction of Madrid. I mean we're likely to keep on going and end up in the Alps or something. Miss all our plane connections and everything. We can still see a little bit of Spain, but I think we oughta just head the old caravan back towards Madrid, ok? We certainly don't want to find ourselves in the Alps, do we? Why have you stopped the car? What do you mean by that? If you think I intend to sit here while you... Just wait a minute, will you, please! If you think I intend to remain here while you just... Will you just wait a minute? - Exactly what am I waiting for? - I'm thinking. - You can think in the car. - I don't want to think in the car. If you plan to stop and scream in a field every time you want to think, Will you please take me to the next town where I can make arrangements to get a bus. Arrangements! You are always making arrangements. Don't worry about arrangements so much! In case you have forgotten, it was your arrangement that we go to Madrid. You took a long walk last night and you thought things out quite clearly. - What were you doing last night? - What I was doing last night is totally irrelevant. - He tried to get you into bed, didn't he? - It was his mother's bed, actually. I was not having sexual intercourse with the duke, if that's what you're thinking. I agree he did try. Now may we please get back into the car? - No. - Walter, I do not find this amusing. - Listen... - I do not want to listen! I know a lot about you, and I've learned a little more about you since yesterday. - What have you learned about me? - That you can hurt me! Because I hate yesterday, I never felt anything like it. I thought my insides had been taken out and I was shaking. To tell you the truth, I thought... I thought I lost you... And it hurt. And that's what you learned about me? That and maybe I can hurt you too. - Look, I know you're uptight... - I am not uptight. I love you, Lila... I really love you. You're a pain in the ass, but I love you. I love you! I got this pain and I figured it's time to go home, but I love you and you're worth the pain. Anyway I do love you. And I got that pain... And I need you. And that's why I stopped the car! - Walter. - I love you. I love you. I love you! I love you and I want to marry you! I mean it. I could live with you. I mean who can live together better than you and I have? Now we know all about love, and pain, the whole damn thing. So we'll live together. You know what I'm saying? We'll live together. We can even go on after La Mancha. I'm asking you to be my wife, okay? What's the matter? I'm going to die. Elbertson! I thought you'd be with your folks in Aspen by now. No, I thought I'd stick around Spain for a while. - How are you, Carl? - I'm fine. I'm fine, Elbertson. Oh Carl, I would like you to meet a friend of mine, Miss Lila Fisher. Lila, this is Carl Stokowski. - Pleased to meet you, Miss Fisher. - How do you do. I had a lot of trouble with your bike, you know. It was a big mess. - I'm sorry about that, Carl. - Well, it's okay I guess. - Tell me, are you still on schedule? - Actually, we're running late. Nelson had a toothache back in Las Molinas. Anyhow, we're flying to New York next week in case you're interested. Not just yet. Thanks anyway, Carl. Okay. Well, I guess we better be going. - Nice to have met you. - Nice to meet you. - You should have taken that ticket. - We haven't gotten to La Mancha yet. Alright. We'll go to La Mancha. Did you hurt yourself? No. No. Are you alright? Are you alright? Yes... I'm fine. - I broke a plate. - Don't worry about it, it's just an old plate. - Do you want to lie down for a while? - Mmm, yes. - I'm afraid to look. - The whole place is a mess! We'll have to sleep upside down. "My Dear Walter, I know this is cruel." "I haven't the courage to do it any other way." "But I must go home, and on with my work and my life." "As you must go on with yours." "I will always adore you." "I think we've had the best of it. Lila." The fate of any of us - you, Mrs. Elbertson, Melanie, me, or Walter - is unimportant. What counts is not what happens to our lives, but what we do with them. It's the essence of all my works. - Yes. - So, the Christian hope is well-founded. - What about God? - Then that's the future, isn't it? - That's what God's accomplished. - She's right. Throughout history, man has looked up to the heavens in his search for God. But leave it to my Melanie to search the bottom of the seas. I've got permission to take daddy down in the bathosphere next month. Oh really? I half expected you were going to build your own. They teach God and oceanography? I wish I could start a life of exploration. Perhaps you'll find the God we lost among the fish at the bottom of the sea. Dear Lila, How did we come together? Why did it have to end? Just because your life's going to end sooner than it should, Why do we have to end sooner than we should? We never seemed to have anything to do with things ending. Things were always beginning with us. You see when I really think about it, you're wrong. We haven't had the best of it.
