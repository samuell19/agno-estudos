- Help me! Please! - So what does Rosebud represent? - The sled. - Yes, yes it is. But why does he say it? Why is Rosebud his dying breath? Welles himself said that it represents the simplicity and comfort of Kane's boyhood home. Maddie? What was Welles trying to say about Hearst? - That power corrupts. - All right, everyone. Read the next chapter and be prepared to talk about Pulitzer's influence. Maddie. If I catch you texting in class again, you know I have to send you to the office. You're a good kid, Madeline. Don't focus on the noise, all right? - Admit it. I'm right. - Stop it. - What? He's totally doable. - Jeez, Kelly. - Don't act like you're not thinking about it all day. You're obsessed. - You're disgusting. - I'm honest. At least he likes you. - Well, I can help you study. Want me to come over? - To my place? Literally never. - Okay, then come over to my house. Mom's making spaghetti tonight, and we could text Ava. - Goody. Carb night with the normals. - For one second, could you not be so mean and say, "Thank you for inviting me over all the time. "Sorry I'm always flaking on you, "but I would love to come. I'll definitely make it this time." - You're drooling. - Hey. - Hi. - You're kinda new, right? - Yeah. Kind of. - Katie. - Kelly. - The foster kid. Yeah, I volunteer for Habitat. I think we fixed the roof on your parents' house. It's the one on 8th Street, right? - Yep, they're not really my parents. - Cool if I do a post with you? - Um, yeah.... - Hey, guys! This is the new girl, Katie. - ... Kelly. - You remember that Habitat project that I coordinated last year? Well, she is actually living in that house now. You support me so that I can support girls like this. Much love! - Bet her boobs are fake. - I had gym with her. They're not. - Hey. - Hey! - Hey. - Kell, I saw the Sashagram. - The trash-o-gram. - Yeah, and she didn't even tag you. - Whatever, Sasha's miserable, and it's just news to you because you haven't lived here your whole life. - Yeah. - Hey. That's her "bleacher boyfriend" face. - Wait, you guys are doin' it now? - Yup. - No! No... not yet. - Yup. - It's been, like, what, two months? - Yeah, you guys started talking the first week I moved here. - So have you, like, told him you loved him? - No. - How does it work? Does he let you call him Mr. Davenport, or... - Okay, you're both canceled. - See you tonight. - You didn't respond to my message. - I got your message. I like that message. - What are you doing tonight? - I gotta study with the girls. - Well, you working Friday? - Not if I get my shift covered. - Really? - Yep. - Okay, so if your mom still thinks you're at work... - Then we'll have the car. - And we could go somewhere. - Anywhere you want. But right now I gotta go. I promised my mom I'd check out her new listing, so... - Maddie... Hey. - Hey, you too. - My God, Mom. This place is huge. - I know. It's a tough sell. A big asking price. The seller's not willing to negotiate. - How much? Come on. I'm just gonna google it. - 3.3. - Okay, so 4.5 commission, that's, like, 150 grand. - Those SAT classes are paying off. - Gucci life. - Not exactly, but I might be able to pay off most of your college. - I'm just glad these people figured out how hard you've been working all these years. - I know. - I'm so proud of you, Mom. - Aw. - I know Dad is too. Thank you, honey. - It's called a delete button, and it's really not that hard to use. It's really not that hard to use. - That's my fault. - Hey, making us dinner? - No, I'm going over to Maddie's to study. - Says who? - You don't want me to study? - Don't sass me, girl. - Whatever. Stop it, Danny. - Listen to your mama. - Why'd you do that? - It ain't like she's my daughter. She's ain't your daughter, either, so give me a break. - You're disgusting. - Yup. - Hey, guys. I just wanted to thank you all for your support. Ab day absolutely kicked my ass. But... work hard, play hard. And your love is all the motivation that I need. And look, it's not glamorous. I mean, sweat is just fat crying. #RealTalk. #Sashagram. - Hey, guys! Um, I just picked this up today. What do you think? Is green my color? Let's do a poll. You do like it? Thanks. Thank you. What the hell? - That looks nice. - Get out! - Where'd you get it? - Get out, get out! - Where'd you get it? You got a boyfriend or something? - Go, go! - He got money? - The hell did I tell you? - Get out! - My God, she has, like, 300 new followers since she posted that video. - Dude, I saw that bra at Nordstrom's for, like, 30 bucks. Where'd she get that money? - Okay. Help yourself, girls. - Okay, Mom. - And no cell phones. - I know, Mom. - That's Kelly. I'll get it. Hey, girl. Hey, you okay? - Eat, Ava. Mom, this is so good. Is this that, Cajun seasoning you use? It's different. Do you like it? - It's Tony Chachere's, right? - That's how you say it? - Yeah. Um, the first foster home I was in, it was in Louisiana. We put that stuff on everything. - You've been here a few months, right? - Yeah. A week after courtwarming. - Are you liking it? - I don't know. It's high school. - Seriously, where'd you get the bra? - I bought it. - Wait, what was that post about anyways? - Okay, that post got me 327 new followers in, like, two hours. Besides, Sasha's making videos about her boob sweat and getting 5,000 views. She's not better than us, she just plays the game better. - Yeah, but prettier and richer and... - No, she's just a regular girl like us. - Well, I don't think I want to play her game. - What if we did? - Did what? - What if we could beat Sasha? - She probably pays for half her followers. Meanwhile, you're stealing bras from the mall. - I bought it! - Liar. - How's the studying, girls? - So good, Mom. - Ms. Reynolds, I heard about your new listing. Pretty frickin' awesome. Like, total boss move. - Thank you, Kelly. Okay, 30 more minutes. - Thanks, Mom. - Okay, seriously, did you just Jedi-mind-trick my mom into giving us 30 more minutes? - I am so sick of girls like Sasha getting everything they want and girls like us getting dumped on. I've been to five different high schools. There's a Sasha Curtis in every single one of them. Suck it, Sasha. - What, what are you doing? - I'm just playing the game. - Hey. Come here a second. - Go back to sleep, Danny. - No, come here a second. I want to apologize. I walked in on you before. I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry. But I ain't sorry for what I saw. You know, you might want to get a little boyfriend down at that school of yours. I could show you what to do with that body. Hey. Sorry about earlier. I... brought you this beer to apologize. Still thirsty? - Hey. I really like you. - I more than like you. Wish I could kiss you right now. - Yeah, well I guess I'll have to give you tonight's kisses tomorrow. - Hey, um... I wanted to tell you I... didn't get into NYU. - What? Babe, I'm so sorry. What are you gonna do? - I don't know. I mean, hopefully Pratt or Columbia will come through. You know, if not... I guess take some classes and try to transfer out next year. - What's that look for? - Guess I'm just scared about next year. - Why? - Well... I'm worried about us and my mom and... I guess I just don't want anything to change. - You know, Mads... change doesn't always have to be a bad thing. - My God, Danny. Danny. Danny! Yes, please come soon. My... my boyfriend, he won't wake up. I think he's dead. - This brought rise to yellow journalism, which is what? Maddie? - Um, like, overdramatic headlines. Like today's tabloids. - Yes, right. And these headlines were meant to be sensational, not necessarily truthful. The bigger the headline, the better the paper would sell. - Hey, what's up? Where are you? - It's Danny. - My God. Is he messing with you again? - He's dead. - What? How? - I don't... I still have to talk to the cops and stuff. - Is there anything I can do? How's Destiny? - She's a disaster. I don't know, I just... I just have to deal with this. - Just text me if there's anything I can do. - Wait. Um, have you seen Sasha today? - No. - I think that last post we did got under her skin. She hasn't posted anything since. - Yeah. - I know he was a weirdo creep, but jeez. Tragic. - She's just been through so much already. - Look, she just posted. - Hey, guys. Um... this morning my foster father committed suicide. He was the closest thing that I had to a dad in my life. If you're ever having thoughts of depression or suicide, just know that you're not alone. You can call the 24-hour national suicide hotline at the number on the screen. Love to you all. Except for you, Sasha. You can rot for all I care. - What the hell? - Holy crap. No, she didn't. - Hey, you. Hey yourself. Okay, so um... I was thinking... prom? Do you want, like, a... Like, a promposal, or... - Ew, no. - No? - Gross. - Okay. - But whoever asks me, I think that he should just come out and ask me and be chill about it. - Whoever? So what? You have, like, a lot of dudes in mind, or... - Well, I'm trying to get my likes up, so anything can happen. Speaking of, um... what was the deal with that Kelly post? The thing about her dad was crazy. - It's not her... Kelly's going through a lot right now, and she feels like Sasha needs to be knocked off her perfect pedestal. - And what do you think? - Sasha! Would you sign a petition to allow our janitorial staff an additional day? - What? Ew, no. - Suck it, Sasha. - So why do you care so much about Sasha all of a sudden? - Because Kelly's my friend, and she's right. Sasha's the worst. - Okay, look, we got, like, what, two more months of this place, and then all this stuff is in the past. - For you. You're leaving. - Yeah, and of course I'm trying to. Don't you want to? What about New York? Okay, well... you could either wait tables here or you could wait tables in the greatest city in the entire world. - Paris? - Fine, I'll go to Paris with you. - Aw! But will you go prom with me? - Wait, I... I thought I was supposed to ask you. - Don't be so gender-normative. - Yes, I will go to prom with you. I'll go anywhere with you. - Aw. - Are you okay? - I know he wasn't a good man. And I'm sorry for how he treated you. I don't know what I'm gonna do without him. - Is it okay if... Maddie said that I could stay with her for a few nights. I just don't think that I can sleep here right now. Smells like death, don't it? I'm sorry. - Um, thanks again for having me. It's, like, really weird in the house right now. - You're so welcome. - You're a... a really good mom. - Thanks. Come in, honey. You should've seen it. She was totally freaking out. The whole cafeteria was just laughing at her. You can totally see up your shorts! - So? "Like what you see?" #PeekABoo. #SuckltSasha. - You are so thirsty. Don't be such a Puritan. - Look. New Sashagram. - Hey, so I've been seeing you guys using the hashtag #SuckltSasha, and I just wish we could all be a little more kind to each other during these difficult times. - What? She's totally using my own hashtag against me. And look, she just posted two minutes ago, and she already has over 400 likes. Gosh, we really need to up our game. - What do you mean? - We should totally kiss. - Hard pass. - No, it's not, like, gross. It'll be cute. - I don't think I want to do that. - Well, you have to do something, 'cause you're not helping. - I have an idea. Hey, everyone, it's Maddie, and I'm here with Crazy Kelly, and we're having a little slumber party, and we just wanted to give a little shout-out to all you Sashagrammers out there. Suck it, Sasha. - My God, you guys. I can't believe you did that without me. Maddie, have you ever gotten that many likes? - Definitely not. - And it was her idea. - Hey, sexy. What's wrong? What? What the hell was that post last night? - It's just a post. - Yeah, but you're, like, half naked. - Don't be such a Puritan. - I don't know what's going on with you, but I don't like it. - Kurt. - Hi, honey. Where's Kelly? - Um, she had to pick up an extra shift. I think she's trying to save money for prom. - You know, if she needs help buying a dress, I am more than happy to help, okay? Hey. You okay? - Kurt didn't get in to NYU. - Honey. - He really wants to go to New York. He's gonna go to New York, you know? And do you want to go to New York? - I don't know what I want to do. What do you think Dad would say? - You know what your dad would say. Do whatever makes you happy. - Yeah, well he's not here to make you happy, and I don't know what to do about that. - Honey, I am happy, and as much as I love you and I want you close to me, I also want you to see the world. You are so smart and so strong. You have the potential to do whatever you put your heart into, okay? Okay. - Okay. - Kelly... let's talk after class, all right? - Mr. Davenport, I'm so sorry. - Kelly, I heard what happened at your foster home. - I... yeah. - Were you close with him? - Yeah, I was. - Listen, I want to give you every opportunity for success, but you gotta do the work. Now, I'm not totally hip to everything that's going on, but I know there's something between you and Sasha. You need to focus on what's important, which is passing your classes and graduating. Understood? - Yeah, can I, like, maybe retake the test? - No. But at the end of the semester, I let each student throw out their lowest test grade. Now, let's make sure that this is the one that we throw out, okay? - Is that Sasha? - Yeah. I was the school's rep for the Future Leaders of America Council. She was selected last year. I was a chaperone. - Cute. - Are you okay? - I am so sorry. I was leaning back to take a picture. - Sure, Sasha. - Hey. Let's not do this. I am so anti-cyberbullying, and this just isn't a great look on you. - Ladies? - You girls have no idea. - We'll see about that. - She clearly did it on purpose. I mean, she had someone ready waiting for you. Maybe this whole thing's going a little too far. - God. Not another promposal. - No, I think you're gonna want to see this. - Can I have everyone's attention, please? Sasha Curtis, we have a special announcement from a very special someone. Five, six, seven, eight. - We gotta raise the bar. I mean, that lunch venue just proves that people want something big. - Like what? - Something dangerous. - Hey, less talk and more show. I wanna see what we're working with here. - Okay, what do you think? - It's a little '80s. - Okay. - Ava, that's gorgeous. - Is it too gowny? - I don't know what that means. - Wow. Kelly. - Can you... can you take a Boomerang for me? - I don't know what that is, but... I don't know what to do, though. - Just hold that button down. - Okay... ready, go. - Did you get it? - I think so. Check. - Thanks again, Ms. Reynolds. - You're so welcome, sweetie. - Hey Mom, can I have the keys? I wanna drive. - Ava, do you need a lift, honey? - No, I drove. - Okay. - She actually has a car. - Sasha hasn't posted since this morning. - Is that Sasha Curtis? - What, you know her? - Yeah, Maddie and her used to be best friends. - What? Wh... how have you not mentioned this to me? - That was, like, a long time ago when we were just kids and before she was all, like... - Her father is one of the partners at my agency. I have known him since I was your age. - What's the craziest thing you ever did in high school? - The craziest? Well, I don't know about crazy, but the stupidest thing was the Red River cliff walk. - You haven't even told me about this. - You know the river gorge where your dad used to take us fishing? Well, in high school, we used to do this thing kind of like a dare because it was before everyone did stupid things on YouTube. So the kids would go up there at sunset, and they would walk the cliff edge with their eyes closed. - You did this? - Well, most kids chickened out. But, some made it all the way across. - Anyway, senior year, a kid from another school fell off and died. All the kids smartened up and stopped trying. You think you're invincible when you're 17. That's the high school calling. Hello? Yes, it is. I'm sorry? Yeah, I'm actually with Madeline and Kelly right now. I am so sorry. I will talk to both of them. Thank you, bye. That was Principal Decker. Sasha's parents have called the school and said she's being harassed on social media and that both of you are behind it. - No, Ms. Reynolds, she... She's making it up. - Kelly, I think you should stay at your house tonight. Madeline and I need to have a long talk, alone. Keep your eyes on the road unless you want me to drive. - Fine. - Madeline. - What? - What do you mean, what? Bullying, really? - Mom, it's not... - Pull up your posts. - What? - Pull up your posts now. - No. - Excuse me? - I said no. They're private. - You're not 18. You don't get privacy unless I say so. Really, Mom? - Give me your phone. - No. - Give me your phone. I pay for it. - It's locked, anyway. - It's not like I don't see you unlock it a hundred times a day. - Mom, please. Hey, everyone. It's Maddie, and I'm here with Crazy Kelly, and we're having a little slumber party, and we just wanted to give a little shout-out to all you Sashagrammers out there. Suck it, Sasha. - I am so disappointed in you. - I don't know what to do. - I mean... No offense, but I think your mom's right on this one. - But Sasha's not being bullied, she's just getting a little tiny taste of her own medicine. - Yeah, I guess. - I'm sorry I made that post. I wouldn't have done it if I knew it was gonna piss you off so much. - I'm not pissed, I'm just... Honestly, I'm a little worried about you, Mads. I mean, come on. You're better than this. Um, I gotta go, babe. I'll talk to you tomorrow? - Okay. - What are you doing? - Come on. - I'm grounded. - So? - Come on. - Wait, why are you driving? - 'Cause I'm the only one who knows where we're going. - How are you not grounded? - My mom's out of town, and my Dad's oblivious, so I'll hear about it this weekend. - Wait, wait, wait. Ava, call her again. - Call who? - Ava turned off her caller ID. We've been calling Sasha and messing with her. Wait, leave a message this time. - What do I say? - Be really freaky. - Hello, Sasha. Why haven't you been returning my calls? I want to see you tonight. Do you want to see me? - She won't know it's us at all. - Come on. - No way, Kelly. - Whoo! Red River cliff walk. Just like your mom said. - Okay, Kell. Be careful. - Sasha would never do this. - Yeah, 'cause she's not that dumb. - Ava, are you gonna bail on me too? - No... - She's not bailing on something that she never agreed to. Let's just go, Ava. - You guys, it's not a big deal. You close your eyes and you walk along the edge. If you're feel scared, just quit. - I don't know. - Maddie's mom did it when she was our age. - And some kid died. - Ava, come on. You're the most athletic. - She doesn't have to do it. - Let her make up her own mind. - Ava, you don't have to do it. - Stop it, stop it, I'll do it! - Don't be stupid. - Thank you. - Look, I said I'll do it, and I'll do it, okay? You don't have to. - Go ahead, leave. No one's forcing you to stay. - If you're gonna do it, do it. Let's just get it out of the way so I can get the hell out of here. - Stand right here. - Okay. - Close your eyes. - Okay. - You just start there and make it all around the edge of the cliff. Okay, I can do this. - Ava, are you okay? - Actually, it's not that hard. - You guys, it doesn't even look that scary on camera. Like, lean out more. - What? - How am I supposed to do that? - ... Maddie, grab her hand. - No. I'm here under duress and protest. - Well, then, you take the video. - I don't have my phone, remember? I'm supposed to be grounded. - Here, you can use mine. - Suck it, Sasha. Whoo! God. - Okay. - What's your passcode? - 7890. - Okay, take my hand with your right hand. Lean out as far as you can. As you walk. Don't worry, I got you. - God, this is scary. You got me? - I got you. Maddie, how does it look? - Stupid and dangerous. - God, God. How much farther? - You're at, like, the halfway point. Maddie, are you getting this? Help me... pull me up! - Ava! - Ava! Ava! - Maddie? - My God, my God! - What did you do? What did you do? - We've gotta go down there and get her, come on. Call 911! - Wait, where are you going? - Maddie? Come on. Points for knocking. - Ava, Ava! Ava, Ava, talk to me. Talk to me, Ava! She's dying. - Maddie. - No! - Maddie. - What? - We have to go. - What? - We should get back before someone sees us. - Are you crazy? We cannot leave her here. We... call 911. - There's nothing we can do. - Call them. - We can't. - Why? - They will put me in jail. - What are you talking about? This is just an accident. - Really? I snuck you guys out. It was my idea. I convinced Ava to go first. I made her hang over the edge. I let her slip. It was me, not you. The troubled foster kid killed the high school sweetheart. If anyone finds out about this, my life is over. - Maddie. Maddie, you are my best friend in the whole world. I need you to help me. - Hey. Hey, we're gonna get through this. No one knows we're here. - Someone will find her. I used to go fishing with my dad here. What if some little kid's just fishing with their dad and they find her? Did you see what we did to our friend? - Stop. You can't think like that. It was an accident. There's nothing else we can do. Do you still have her phone? You know the password? Let me see it. - Suck it, Sasha. Whoo! - What are you doing? - Ava was the only one that technically wasn't grounded. We have to make it look like she did this on her own. #RedRiverCliffWalk. #SuckltSasha. Good. And now when she's missing they'll know where to look for her. I have to just delete the videos so that there's no proof that we're here. - You have to permanently delete it. From the trash. - Yeah, good call. Only one thing left to do. Ava came here by herself to taunt Sasha. She slipped and fell. It was just all one big terrible accident. - What time is it? - Almost midnight. Only a couple more miles. - How did you sleep? - Fine. I gotta go. I'm late. See you tonight. - Maddie. You okay? - Yeah, I'm just thinking. - Um, have you seen Ava today? Her father called, and she was gone this morning. Car's missing, and she hasn't shown up to school yet, so... Kelly. - Hey. - Um, you haven't heard from Ava, have you? - No. No, I saw she posted pretty late last night from the woods somewhere. - Really? - I don't know, maybe you should check that out. - All right, thanks. Um... are you ready for your test tomorrow? - I will be. - Good. You can do this. - Got a late model Corolla, color beige. License three-eight-hotel- bravo-Charlie-four. We got a 1080 at the bottom of Red River Bluff. Victim appears to be late teens. Dark hair, olive skin. Looks like she's been here for hours. - Hey. Hey, I got your message. What's up? - I just needed to talk to you. - You heard Ava's missing? - Yeah. - Do you know what happened to her last night at the cliffs? - Maddie. Hey, can I talk to you right now? - Kelly, we're kind of in the middle of something. - Sorry, this is really important. - Kelly... yeah, hey. - I'll call you. - Babe. - You can't tell him. - He's my boyfriend. I can't lie to him. - You don't have to lie to him, but you can't tell him, either. Look, you were grounded last night. You haven't seen Ava today. Both of those things are true. - Why is this so easy for you? - I've been dealing with stuff like this my whole life. Cleaning up messes, protecting myself, it's the only way that I survive in this world. - Miss Curtis, you're gonna have to come with us. - Seriously? - Let's go. - For what? - What the hell is going on? - Where are you going? Maddie. - Whose are those? Those aren't mine. - Ms. Curtis, you have the right to remain silent. - Is this some kind of prank? This is ridiculous! - Everything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. - No, I'm not going anywhere with you. No, I'm not going! This is ridiculous! Do not record me. - You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot find an attorney, one will be appointed to you. - I want to speak to my father, now! - Maddie. Maddie, please! Talk to me. - You broke into her locker? - Shh! Keep your voice down. - You broke into her locker, and you planted your shoes? - So what? - The story was Ava went up there alone. - Okay, and they'll figure that out eventually with her daddy's lawyers. She's never actually gonna be in any real trouble, but right now her perfect world is turned upside down. She's getting exactly what she deserves. - Ava's dead, and you're trying to frame an innocent girl. - Innocent? She is a nightmare. We all agreed that she needed to be taken down. - She's not a murderer. - Neither are we. Look, Sasha's gonna try to blame us and all this cyberbullying crap. The cops are gonna come after us too. You have got to keep it together. Stick to the story. - Look, you're either with me or you're against me. You don't want to be against me. That's how people end up like Danny. - Hey, Jack. I wasn't expecting you so soon. Are you okay? - Sasha was just arrested at school. - What? Why? - Ava White's body was found this morning at the Red River cliffs. - My God. - They found shoes in Sasha's locker with mud from the creek. Would you happen to know where Maddie was last night, Gwen? Because my daughter is innocent, and she swears that Maddie and that girl Kelly are responsible for this. - Jack, she was with me all night. I grounded her as soon as I found out about those posts. I mean, this is just teenagers being stupid. You know she would never do anything to hurt anyone. - Listen, Gwen. With everything that's going on, I can't have you at the company right now. - What? - Look. I'll buy your contract out, but that's it. I'm giving this listing to Taylor. - Come on, Jack. - Talk to your daughter, Gwen. And you better pray to God that she don't have anything to do with this. Hi. - Ava's dead. - I know. Come here. - You know, Jack Curtis came to see me today. Told me that Sasha was arrested and then he fired me. - What? - Yeah. Honey, you need to tell me if you had anything to do with last night. - I don't know what happened. I just know that Ava's gone, and... and there's nothing I can do to get her back. - I know. Come here, come here. - It's okay, it's okay. - Sasha Curtis was arrested at school today. Now, we don't know the details, but Sasha, if you're responsible in any way for Ava's death, I hope you rot for what you've done to our beautiful angel. And for everyone else, for those of you who loved Ava the way that I did, I've started an Indiegogo account to help raise money to pay for the funeral that she deserves. A bright and special life was taken from us. I just hope that we can celebrate that life together in a way that she would appreciate. Much love. Come on, Kurt. I'm so glad you picked up. - Hey. Yeah, no. I tried texting you. - Yeah, my mom still has my phone. - I can't believe Ava's gone. How you doing? - Not very good. - Do you... do you really think Sasha had something to do with it? - Listen, I need to talk to you, but it's gotta be in person. - Yeah. Yeah, whatever you need. - Can we just meet at our usual spot tomorrow? - Yeah, of course. - Okay. Thanks, babe. Talk to you later. - I don't have my phone, remember? I'm supposed to be grounded. - Care to explain why these are in your desk drawer? - I've never seen those before in my life. - These belong to you, Miss Reynolds? - I... I don't... I... - Yes. I do my daughter's laundry. - Mom. - Is this her perfume? "I miss you so much. When can we be together again?" - This is all fake. Maddie, did you have something to do with this? - No, I... Mom, you have to believe me. - You snuck out the other night and you lied to me. Was it to meet him? - No. - Mrs. Reynolds, I swear I have no idea... - She is 17. - I don't know what the hell is happening right now, but I have never, I would never cross... - Levi, you need to pack up your stuff and leave. - John, I would never... - You're suspended till further notice. Now, as for you, Miss Reynolds, I think it's best that you go home while we consider when and if you should be permitted to return to class. - Go. - Hey, Maddie! Stop! Girls, stop it! - She's the reason why Ava's dead! I don't know what she's talking about. Maddie, you need help! - We're leaving. - You're not gonna get away with this! - In the car, now. - Mom, just listen to me. Please? - No, you listen. When we get home, we are gonna have a very serious conversation, and you're gonna tell me everything, and I mean everything. This could ruin your life, Stay here. - Hey, what happened to your... What... what's going on? - Please, let's just get out of here, okay? Is it true about you and Davenport? - No. Just come with me, okay? And I tell you about it in the car. - Okay, okay. - Where do you wanna go? - It's my mom. - Do you want me to... - No. Just let it go to voicemail. - Okay. - Take a left up here. I think I know a place we can go. - Where are you? Hey, Kelly? Hi. Are you on your way home? - Yeah. - Maddie's run off. I'm so sorry about what happened earlier. I... I don't know what to do anymore. Can I give you a lift? - Yeah. - Whoa. This is your mom's listing? - It was before Sasha's dad fired her. - So what, we're just gonna, like, break in? - Not exactly. Her company uses the same code on all the padlocks. - How long have you known about this? - I mean, she's been flirting with him since I got here, and I would... I would tease her about it all the time, but when she told me they actually got together... I didn't know what to do. - I mean, I don't get it. Why didn't you just call the cops? - Even though it wasn't her fault, Kelly was worried if they found out, they'd blame her. We even went down to find Ava's body, but there was nothing that we could do to help. - Jesus. - And then she planted her own shoes in Sasha's locker. Now she's trying to say that I slept with Davenport. It's like this is a big game to her. - Do you have any proof that she was there that night? Any evidence? - There was a video on Ava's phone, but we deleted it. - Permanently? - Yeah. Okay, if... If her phone was synced to her cloud, then the footage might be in an archive somewhere that we could pull it from. Do you know, like, her login or ID? - I know the password for her phone, but the cops have that. - Does she have, like, another laptop or an iPad at her house? - She used to keep her old cell phones in her locker. - Yeah, I mean, if one of those is synced, that could totally work. Check this out. - New Sashagram? - Yeah. - So as many of you may know, I just spent the last 24 hours in jail under false charges for a crime I had nothing to do with. Ava White died two nights ago, and the two girls responsible for it are Madeline Reynolds, who funny enough, was one of my best friends when we were kids and Kelly Ryan, whose foster dad just mysteriously OD'd last week. Coincidence much? So for those of you who have continued to support me, I love you, I thank you, and you're my truest friends. - I need to talk to her. This whole thing started with Sasha. It's gonna end with her. - How can I help? - Know how to break into a locker? - Thanks again for the ride. I really hope Maddie's all right. - Hey, Kelly? There's one thing that's really been bugging me about Ava. - What do you mean? - She wasn't there the night I told you girls about the Red River walk. - That's weird. I guess Maddie must have told her. - And that night I went into Maddie's room, and she wasn't there. - That's when she went to see Mr. Davenport. - Right. It's just that the next morning when I went into her bedroom I found her shoes and jeans. They were wet and muddy, like the ones that were found in Sasha's locker. - I have something else I should probably show you. Do you want to come inside? - This... this cyberbullying, social media harassment, I mean, it's far beyond anything we could've imagined when we were that age. A student today could set off a bomb that destroys a peer's reputation irreparably, and the effects of that are felt in this online world for the rest of their lives. I mean, how do we police that? I don't know. Excuse me. Kurt, is that you? - Yeah. Hi, Principal Decker. Sorry... I just... I forgot my homework in my locker. I had to grab it real quick. - Well, hurry up. Make sure the door closes behind you. - Yes, sir. Have a good day, sir. - You're making a mistake, Madeline. - Mr. Curtis, I came here to apologize. Is she here? You know, it's a pretty bold move of you to show up here. This another part of your plan to tear me down? - Sasha, I'm sorry. - Maddie, I don't want to hear it. - Just listen to me, please. - Did you really sleep with Davenport? - No, of course not. This whole thing is Kelly. She's, like, obsessed with tearing you down, and she's just gone so far over the line at this point. She's desperate, and I'm terrified of what she might do next. - I have a video that'll help better explain what happened that night. - Ava! My God, my God! - Maddie, what did you do? - We've gotta go get her! Call 911! - My God. - Wait, where are you going? - I'm sorry, Ava. Yes! - Hey, Kelly. Maddie just showed me something she was able to dig up. Thought you might wanna see. - Okay, take my hand with your right hand. Lean out as far as you can As you walk. Don't worry, I got you. - God, this is scary. You got me? - Maddie, how does it look? - Stupid and dangerous. - Maddie, are you getting this? - Hey, pull me up! - Ava! - Yeah, turns out permanently deleted doesn't actually mean permanent. - Listen, Kelly. If you don't want us to go straight to cops with this, then you need to meet us where we found Ava's body at 6:00 p.m. - No. - If you don't show, we'll turn this over. If you do, we can find a way to make this work for everyone. Stop it, Danny! What the hell? Get out! Hey. Sorry about earlier. I... brought you this beer to apologize. Still thirsty? Do you like what you see? - Yeah. - Drink up. Maybe I'll show you a little more. Hello? Kelly! - The video's not enough. We have to get her to admit that this was her idea and that she framed both of us to make herself look good. - Yeah, and what if we can't do that? - We have to try. - Hey, Kelly. - Maddie just showed me something she was able to dig up. Thought you might wanna see. - Sorry. - Hey! Hey, what the hell? Hey! - Wow. You showed up. - What do you want? - Phones on the ground. No videos, no tricks. We're just gonna handle this ourselves like adults. - Where's your phone, Maddie? - I'm grounded, remember? - How's that going? - It would be nice if my mom didn't think I was sleeping with my teacher. - Come on, Kelly. Do it. No phones. - What the hell? - You said no phones. How do I know that you weren't recording? Maddie, show me your pockets. - I don't have it, I swear. - So what do you propose? - We go to Principal Decker. We tell him it was all just a bunch of pranks that got out of hand. - That video shows that I'm the one holding Ava. I'm the one who let her go. - We don't have to show him the video. We'll just say that we were all up there. - Even me. - She was playing on the ledge, and she slipped, and we were all so scared. It's not our fault. - If we all go in together, my dad's lawyers can help. We can still graduate and put this all behind us. - It's gone too far. It's too late. I've done things. I've done terrible things. - Why did you put my underwear in Davenport's desk? - You're too good. You're too perfect, you and your mom. I just wanted you to know just for a second what misery tastes like. It tastes like blood. It feels... it feels like heartache. It smells like death. Like Danny. - I didn't mean to kill him. I just... I wanted it to stop. - What about Ava? Why did she have to die? - I couldn't hold on to her. - Help me! - So you let her go? - I... I thought that she would catch herself. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, I didn't... - Kurt. - Yeah, got it. You're currently streaming to over 6,000 people live on Sasha's feed. - You lied! - Kelly, stop! Hey! Hey. Hey. Hey, Kelly. Honey, hey, hey, hey, look at me. I know you're hurting. I know, okay? It doesn't have to be this way. Hey, we can start over. - It's too late. - No, it's not too late. It's never too late. - Listen to me. When I lost my husband, I thought it was too late. We lost everything, and we had to start over. There are people that love you and want to help you. Maddie loves you. I love you. - I know. I wish I had a mom like you. - Come here, come here. Shh. It's okay, it's okay. Come here. I know, shh. - I'm sorry. - The live stream got over 20,000 views. You know what? Solidarity. - Okay. Am... am I straight? Is it straight? - Look... you look gorgeous. Stop stressing. - My God, my God, he's here. - Okay, stop. - He's here, okay. - I'll get the door. - Go get... okay, yes. - Kurt. - Hey, Ms. Reynolds. - You look so handsome. Come in. Maddie's just finishing up. So I heard you got into Columbia. - Yeah. - They're gonna love you in New York. - Aw. I heard you sold that house. - Yeah, we... We closed the deal last night. - Wow. - Wow, you. - Um... I... I got you this. - My gosh. Thank you. My gosh. Is that for us? - Yeah. My uncle let me borrow it. Mom, could you take a picture? - Okay, come on. - Okay. - All right. Okay. Say, "Prom night." Prom night. - There you go. - Thank you, Mom. - Love you, honey. You guys be safe. - You gonna post that? - No. Thank you. - You ready? - Hey, I want you to know I'm really excited about you going to New York, and yeah, I'm probably a little bit nervous and, you know, overthinking it. It's just 'cause I don't really know what's gonna happen after we graduate, but I'm gonna work some extra shifts and make sure I get to come visit you. - Really? Who knows? I might even become a New Yorker. - Maddie... hey. - Hey, you too. - I love you. - I love you too.
