At a time when the shadows of the Third Reich were already darkening Germany's skies, F. C. Weiskopf wrote a book that is not only an account of our recent past, but also relates a shocking chapter from the history of the human heart... The need for dreams is great when times are dark and people are without hope. The need for dreams was great in Germany in 1932. The need for dreams was great, and they were cheap and easy to come by. Much easier to come by than work or a loaf of bread. For just 30 pfennigs you could spend a whole afternoon with Greta Garbo. And if you were out of work, for no charge at all, the "Palm Trees of Valencia" and "Elisabeth's Lovely Legs" could magically appear in your cold, bare room. For just three pfennigs you could buy a cigarette whose colorful name evoked the world of the gods of antiquity, a whiff of "The Arabian Nights" or a reminder of King Solomon's royal mistress. Juno: that could mean five minutes of fantasy after an interminable afternoon at the office. Abdulla: five minutes of oblivion after failing to find work. Saba: five minutes of debauchery after a lunch consisting of a single course of sausage with mustard. She was late relieving me again today, and by 13 minutes to boot. Juno? Hangman Thanks. See you. - Ciao. See you. Abdulla, Abdulla, Abdulla. Have you got a light? A light or matches? - Matches. 50-pfennig $1, 50-pfennig $1, How about a date? - No time. Pity. - Bye. Two cheroots, please. - Two cheroots for 20 pfennigs. Lissy, star of my sleepless nights! Two ten-packs of lplic. Two ten-packs of lplic. - What's up with you today? Lovesick? Lovesick? Me? It can happen to anyone. A pack of Laurens, please. - A pack of Laurens. Thanks. Miss Schréder, come to my office afterwards. - Sure, Mr. Warnke. A pack of Juno. At quarter to one. Bill] "HINGE, Four for ten pfennigs. How's things? - OK. I just wanted to add... Quarter to one means quarter to on the dot and not after quarter to. Is that understood? Trouble? - It's because I gave him the brush-off. See you this evening, then. - I can't come. A pack of Abdulla, please. - Certainly. Why not? - Thanks. It'll be interesting. A female comrade's going to speak. A pack of Nil, please. - Certainly. Thanks. - Thank you. Getting too fine for us? - Don't be silly... 7.5 Murat“, phase. - Sure. Thanks. - Thank you. I really can't come. Scout's honor. - See you. - Bye. O h! Miss Schréder... Tell me: Are you ill? Well? Are you ill? - No. I see. That's strange... So what were you doing at the doctor's yesterday? FACT SHEET FOR EXPECTANT MOTHERS I can imagine how embarrassing it must be for you to be confronted with this by me. It is, after all, a very delicate matter. But I could still put everything in order. You just need to be reasonable, Lissy... - Hands off, you dirty old man! What's going on? - The sleazebag tried to get fresh with me. Get out! Both of you get out! You're fired, you shameless hussy! Making accusations against me when you're pregnant! That's right, I am. But it didn't happen the way your dirty mind thinks it did. I'm married. Do you understand? Married. So go ahead and report me to the management, you old dirtbag. I won't tolerate tramps like you here! She's fired and that's that! TRAVEL AGENCY Now let's go eat! I'm totally famished... - I can't today. But what will Miss Lissy say? Appointment. Excuse me, could you tell me where Mr. Ebermann lives? Mr. Ebermann? Him? You'll have to go to Moabit Jail. He's been there for 8 weeks. You can guess why. Who the hell do you think you're talking to? You clearly don't know who I am! I thought if you were asking about Ebermann, you must know him. Anyway, it was in all the newspapers. BACKSTREET ABORTIONS ON COMMERCIAL SCALE! All of them married! Even their husbands were arrested. They should've taken precautions. Watch where you're going! M. - m. Did you see him? - Where've you just come from? Did you get off early? - Well, you see, Freddi... ...and then he threw me out. - What? HIKE? £125, It never rains but it pours! What's the matter? - I don't feel well at all. I shouldn't have told you. - Nonsense, Freddi! That's not what made me feel dizzy. - What can I get you? A black coffee and a beer with fruit syrup. - Certainly. It's a normal part of having a baby. Listen, Freddi, we'll manage somehow. We'll find a way. I'll keep the baby. That'll be nice, eh? - But Lissy... Let's get married soon. Then I can tell my parents everything at once: about the wedding, me no longer working, and the baby. Don't be childish: with no money and no place to live? I'm not being childish! Thanks. - Your good health. - Thank you. If you give up your room we can move in with my parents. In their district of all places? So what? You know what? We'll go there right now and talk with them. OK? Come on. I want to get away from these stinking proles, not move closer to them. Once we've got a roof over our heads we can look for something else. If we move here, we'll never get away, believe me. You now what? I'll have a word with Max and Toni tomorrow. When we're married you'll have to break off your friendship with those Reds. I don't like it one bit! Whatever is the matter with you today? Come on. -You go by yourself. I didn't mean it. - That's all right. We're just having a bad day. Goodnight, Freddi. - Goodnight. Hi! - Don't come in. What's the matter? - Father's having a fit! Did something happen? It's from Paul! "Dear Parents: As I can't find a job and there's no sense in waiting, I'm moving out, so as not to be a burden anymore." Something bad was bound to happen. No chance of finding a job, and Father's long lectures whenever he needed money. A young man wants to be able to pay his own way. - Mother. I gave him money, too. - You meant well, but you're a girl and in work and he has nothing to do. Come on! ('Mm I have something to tell you, too. So now you know. That's a fine brother you've got. - But Father... It's not all Paul's fault. - No, I'm to blame. And I'm to blame for that snob Fromeyer as well, eh? We're not good enough for him. Don't bring him here! You work so your kids can make something of themselves and this is the reward. I don't have a son anymore. What'll happen to Paul? Lissy ran into her brother several months later under circumstances that were rather peculiar. Berlin News! Latest reports! Berlin News! Latest reports! Dozy women like that are easy pickings. Look, there she is. Quite a doll, eh? I'll be right back. - OK. Did you find a brown purse? All my household money. I just had it... - Here it is, Lissy! Paul! How come you've got my purse? I saw you drop it. - Where, here in the store? Where else? - Why didn't you give it to me right away? MEMBER?!“ Where did you get all those things? - I bought them, of course! I've got to go now. - But I haven't seen you for so long! I'm busy. - No excuses. You're coming to our new apartment. To your place? No, thanks! - Freddi isn't home. Did you know we have a baby? - Yes, a little boy. And you haven't even seen him yet. A fine uncle you are! All right, I'll take us there. - Take? Yes, I've got my own wheels. - Your own what? As you can see: a motorcycle. Step inside, madam. She's a beauty, isn't she? Used, but in perfect shape. Nice cozy place you have here. - Here. It just seems that way. What do you mean? - The baby was premature. The hospital cost a fortune... and the furniture payments are pretty steep, too. So there's hardly anything left out of Freddi's salary for us to live on. But tell me about yourself. There's not much to say. - Don't be like that. You can tell me where you get the money for all those things. I print it myself. Tell me the truth, Paul. - Drop it, Liesbeth. I just have it. It can't be from an honest job. - Give me a break, will you? Not from an honest job? You go out and find me one... with 6 million unemployed. It's easy for you to talk about honesty. Your husband puts money on the table every month. I want something from life, too. Do you understand? So what they don't give me, I take. I've had enough of having to struggle all the time! ('Mummy It's all a complete mess. The life the likes of us lead... is screwed up from start to finish. You can't do anything to help me either, so just leave me alone. I don't want anything from anyone. But I won't let anyone rain on my parade. OK? You can't carry on like this. What'll happen to you? Don't make me laugh! Think about yourselves. It could happen to you, too. I mean... nobody's immune. Sorry, I didn't mean to be all doom and gloom. I didn't mean any harm, Lissy. And now I really do have to go. Come on. Come on now, honey. Let's warm up Daddy's dinner. Do have a seat, Fromeyer. Thank you, sir. A ciigar? Thank you very much, sir. - You're welcome. Go ahead. Come now, Fromeyer. Keep a cool head, that's the main thing. Thanks. And especially you. A first-class person such as you will always have a chance of finding work. Even during the worst depression. - I don't know. I hope the company will take my special circumstances into consideration. I just got married. But my dear Fromeyer... You knew you were the youngest man in the office. And you must've known you would be the first one to go if things got tight. You should've postponed your marriage plans. The trouble is, sir... We have a baby. If you don't manage to find anything better, we could maybe... I mean, it might be possible to... Mightn't it, Mr. Gold? You have our word of honor. We'll rehire you when the time's right. Isn't that right, sir? - Well... I wish you all the best, Fromeyer. And give my best regards to your wife. A feeling had been awakened in Lissy, a feeling that now overcame her frequently and which had been intensified by Paul's visit. The feeling was fear. There, there, now... It was strange that Lissy was a mother. A baby? That would've been unimaginable two or three years earlier. She had always said yes to love. She liked men and had always taken great pleasure in their tenderness, and she indulged in this pleasure with a cheerful matter-of-factness. Put simply: She loved love. And now the child had become a kind of first love to Lissy. A playful, bullying, helpless first love. A love that had only just turned from a dream into reality, that transformed with each new day, laughter quickly turning to bears and tears suddenly turning to laughter. It fulfilled her completely. It made her happy. You bunch of schmucks... Do you know what you're doing? Murder, that's what it is. You're cold-bloodedly murdering us. GERMANY AWAKEN! Jim... You're murdering me, my wife and our baby. Do you understand that? Having a child in this day and age? That's hopelessly imprudent, Fromeyer. I'll get your papers and salary ready. You'll get a full month's pay, without deductions. As of tomorrow you don't have to come to work. You see how considerate we are, Fromeyer? Considerate? That beats everything! Not having to come to work as of tomorrow is supposed to be a favor, eh? You'd sell your own grandmothers. Dirty, rotten exploiters! That's right... downfall! But I won't let them wipe the floor with me. You shysters! You crooks! What's wrong with your husband? - Why? - He's standing on the corner and... Look, Freddi. We're bound to find a job for you. As what? A door-to-door salesman? We'll manage, don't you worry. With my connections... Lissy wasn't lying. She really did have connections: from her old job. A few of her regular customers had bought ten-pfennig cigarettes, jovial, well-situated gentlemen. And if I say I'll see what I can do, then I'll definitely find something, you can depend on that. Miss Lissy... Pardon me! Mrs... - That's all right. Mrs... What's your name now? Fromeyer? I'll never remember that. But I don't need to, do I? I can still call you Miss Lissy, can't I? Or simply Lissy, if I may? I'd go through fire for you if I had to. - Really? But why go through fire? Finding a job for my husband would do for now. That's as good as certain. This doesn't change our agreement: Your husband will get the job at Berlin Wholesale. BERLIN WHOLESALE OFFICES TO LET! BRUSH SALESMAN WANTED. PAPER SALESMAN WANTED. FIXED SALARY AND COMMISSION. SAUSAGE SALESMAN WANTED. I've had enough! I can't go on anymore. Come on, eat something. And who's to blame for everything? Hoppe and Gold, that Jew. - But Freddi... Gold is just a lowly employee. I don't understand why the Jews are to blame. What don't you understand? It's the whole system... - Freddi! Please don't interrupt me. What don't you understand? Germany must awaken at long last! - Not that baloney again. I asked you not to interrupt me, you hear me? And? -Or I'll... This isn't funny anymore! - It hasn't been for a long time! Ah, my dear brother-in-law! Just what I need. - I came to see my sister. She's my wife and I decide who visits her! Crooks like you aren't welcome here! You must be off your rocker. It's not you I came to see. I'm going. - Stay here! He's a hoodlum... a Vagabond. Have you lost your marbles? Mam? I was really off my rocker. But chasing around for work and worrying about what's going to happen to us... it can drive you crazy. Are you still mad at me? Are you still mad at me? SALE Get back! Get back, all of you! What's going on? We've just evicted them. For the second time. We had them out once, then some jobless men carried their things back inside. Anyway, we've finally got rid of them now. They don't deserve anything else. - Break it up there! Teach them a lesson! Anyway, it's true. They're getting far too uppity. It's time they were taught a lesson. You're getting too uppity! It's time you were taught a lesson! AGRICULTURAL POLICY BREAKS DOWN The unemployed are right to put things in order. Don't you think so? The unemployed putting things in order? They're all a bunch of Reds. They don't create order, they create disorder. From the furniture company, certified mail. They'll end up repossessing the bedroom furniture. I've a strange feeling. Well, what is it? - The last warning. I'll go over there later. They'll be reasonable. We need to think seriously about what we're going to do. The landlord won't wait forever either. - Just give me my grub. We'll soon be out on the street, with no furniture and no apartment. Leave me alone, will you? I can't stand it anymore. Enjoy your meal. The police were here twice asking about you. You're not setting a foot in here. You can't do that! - I know what I have to do! You can't turn him away! - I'll deal with it! But he's your son! - Leave me alone! They're our downfall... the furniture makers... and the landlords. I've tried everything. Hoppe and Gold, the system... ...and the Jews. You're attracting unwelcome attention, sir. Please leave the premises. Don't want to hear the truth, eh? Are you one of those bloodsuckers, too? This is the limit! I won't be thrown out of here! Not by anyone! HeY. Fromeyer! The best in our class! Some reunion, eh? You practically fell into my arms. Kaczmierczik? Just look at me. Where did you come from? - Surprised, eh? Let's have a drink on it. We'll grab a beer, eh? This is my car. Get in. Come on! In this get-up? - Don't worry about it. Get in. The drinks are on me! You seem to be in bad shape. Never mind. The drinks are on me! Let's go! 'lawman, Even the best man can hit the skids these days. - That's right. It's because of this rotten system. On your own you're at the mercy of big business. - I agree. Two more shots and a beer. And be quick about it. -You're right. The Jews are our downfall. He's really flying today. We need a new order! You can think it over if like... But not for too long. Once we're in power it'll be too late. And Adolf will do it, you can bet on it! USE You have to strike while the iron's hot. Anyway, we can talk about it another time. Give me a call at the district office. Standartenfijhrer Kaczmierczik... An official call, of course. Thanks. Heil Hitler, Standartenfijhrer! - Heil! Heil Hitler! I'm glad I ran into you. Vacate your apartment immediately and pay your back rent! Quite a surprise, eh? He's wondering why I'm here. I just wanted to see if the fine gentleman... wouldn't let the crook in after all. Because he has this. Pretty, eh? And it doesn't smell bad either. Even if it comes from a crook? From your crook of a brother-in-law... Right, Mr. Fromeyer? It's true, Lissy. I have to put up with that. From some little punk! The crooks' pockets are full all right. While those of us who finished high school... You can die from honest work. But when the Fijhrer comes to power... he'll make a clean sweep of things. With an iron hand... he'll destroy everything harmful to our people. In the new Reich... every member of the German nation will have his honor guaranteed. What's so funny? -You're drunk. This isn't like you. You're talking like a Nazi. - So what? And if I am... There's nothing wrong with it. Not the way I see it. And for your information, I'm joining them! Just look at him. Is he a Brownshirt, too? - He should stop showing off. Two weeks ago he didn't know whether he was coming or going. If you must put on such a show, close the window. After Freddi joined the Brownshirts, life improved a little for Lissy and her family. But the ground beneath her feet seemed shakier to her than ever before. She would have liked to run away from her fear, her anxiety and her doubts. But that was impossible. What's the matter? Is something wrong with the baby? - What do you mean? I was over in Reinickendorf. I had some shopping to do. - You can't fool me. I can tell by your face that something's not right. I'm just a little tired maybe. How are you? How's Father doing? - I don't know. I've been worried about him lately. Something's wrong. He had a bad argument with Uncle Gustav earlier. Father shouted that the unions should stop being so quiet and passive. He called Uncle Gustav a fat cat and Gustav called him a Bolshevik in return. What is the world coming to? There isn't even any peace in your own four walls. I think you'd better go now. But Father will be here any moment. - That's why. He saw Freddi on the street in his Brownshirt uniform, and if he finds you here, he'll have another fit. You know what he's like. All right... We'll go home, then. Isn't he sweet? - He's so cute. Almost like Paul was at that age. You know I don't mean any harm. - Sure. Bye. Wrap him up warm, it's windy outside. Lissy had a bad taste in her mouth, like she used to when she had done something wrong during her training. Everything was wrong, and all she had to look forward to was a long, cheerless evening. No, she couldn't be alone tonight. What's wrong with Paul? We haven't heard from him in ages. Me neither, he doesn't live at home anymore. - Why not? Did he find a job at last? - Oh God, he earns his money one way or another. I see... Why are you of all people upset? You always said unemployment's to blame when someone goes to the bad. This was stuck on your fence. We got one, too. What is it? Let me see. You didn't quite understand me. Some people might say that Paul is fighting capitalism. But that's not true. You can't fight capitalism alone, and certainly not on your own behalf. It has to be done very differently. Max Franke... you take care of him, OK? - OK! Defang that dog! -Yes, sir! - Then let's go! Remove your belts and spread out! Did he get your husband a job? He promised him one! - What kind of job? Maybe with the staff guard. But that's the SA, the Brownshirts! You say it like it was completely normal. The SA isn't a bridge club. Do you know what that means if Freddi joins them? How else are we supposed to get out of the hole we're in? It's not just about Freddi and me, we've got a baby to feed. We can't just go to the dogs. You'll go to the dogs in a different way with the SA. Take my word for it. - Take your word for it? I believe in my husband, not in your never ending political talk. You always think you know better! You don't know Freddi. He won't turn into a murdererjust byjoining the SA. WATCH OUT, YOU RED DOGS. HITLER'S SA Get a move on! Hurry! Maxim Don't go too far, or I'll get into trouble. Don't worry. You've got nothing to do with it. It won't be that bad. Uncle Max, get out of here! The Nazis are coming! - What? Run over to the Lembkes, tell them to muster the Red Defense Corps. I'll go over to Walter's. I have to warn him. I must get away with the baby. - It's too late. But... - Stay here. Turn off the lights. You can't see a darned thing! Point the headlights over here! Oh, my God! They'll kill him! Finish him off! The Reds! Let's go! Hurry UP! Run to the bridge! Why, it's Max Franke! You can't trust the cops! They're in cahoots with the SA! This is a disgrace! - Quiet! Quiet! They've given Franke quite a beating. What happened here? They've beaten him half to death. Who did? - Who? The Nazis, of course. What do you mean "of course"? We'll have to look into it first. You two come with me! - No way! Cowards! - Scram! Make way there! What did you say? It won't be that bad? Good evening. - Good evening. Where've you been? I had to do night duty. Night duty? Where? - In front of City Hall, guarding a meeting again in the cold. Respectable What's that supposed to mean? This whole thing just isn't you. I know you... I know how unhappy you are... - OK, you're right. All that marching, standing around with a collection box, guarding meetings! I'm so sick and tired of it all. You're right. Good evening. Special muster in one hour, in battle gear. Something's in the offing again. - Take your muster and shove it. I'm sick. - Not today, my friend. Everyone has to show up. - I'm sick and that's that! Get out. - Another man gone. No surprise with these duds and the lousy pay. It's all the same to me... but you'll be in the hot water. Attention! Scharfijhrer Alfred Fromeyer, step forward! Your courage... in refusing to attend the special muster called by a rebel party faction, has not been forgotten by the Fijhrer. This manly deed should be rewarded. For your proven loyalty, I promote you, in the name of the Fijhrer, to the rank of Sturmfijhrer! Congratulations, Sturmfijhrer Fromeyer! Stand at ease! Thank you. Just between us: Some of our old sponsors who'd been short of cash lately have filled up the party coffers again. They can smell success coming. Take my word for it, we're on the up and up! Mrs. Fromeyer? What is it? - More new furniture has arrived. Out of the way, Moses. See to the piano, Mrs. Kaluweit... This way. Have the men take it into the living room. But where will it go? The room's so full already! Tell them to set it down anywhere. Thank you. - Heil Hitler, Madam Sturmfijhrer. And Merry Christmas! So they now had a new apartment. Kaczmierczik had kept his word. Yes, your new dress really suits you. You look prettier than you did in the old place. Your life has become easier, quieter. Heil, Sturmfijhrer! - Heil, comrades! But are you really at ease? Season's greetings, my girl. Now we can celebrate! Kaczmierczik came along, too. Well? How do you like your new mirror? You always wanted one like that. Come on. Come on! - All right! 5331111 Here's our Christmas angel! Merry Christmas! Pretty lady. - Merry Christmas! Thank you. Set another place at the table, Mrs. Kaluweit! Two more places! - Why two? A big surprise, pretty lady! - You'll be amazed, my girl! I can't wait to see what it is! Didn't I say you'd be amazed? Hi, Lissy. Lissy, don't just stand there. Make yourself at home, Paul. Mrs. Kaluweit! This calls for a celebration. Right. There you go. So... Here's to Christmas, the new apartment, and to your brother, who found his way to our Fijhrer, Adolf Hitler. Sieg Heil! GEE] Cheers, Lissy. Say "Heil Hitler" if you like. Nothing you do surprises me anymore. If our father knew about this... You used to be a member of the Red Youth Front, and now this? Have you lost your mind? Children! No arguing now. Politics is bad for your looks, Lissy! I'll deal with her myself. For a man with spunk like me, the Red Youth Front's no good. I've had enough of all that baloney about discipline and grass-roots work. The only thing to do is hit the fat cats hard! And that's what the SA does. Why shouldn't I join them? They're making a revolution, too, and not just with words. I tell you, they're all right. We want some of the gravy, too! - That's right, brother-in-law. Drink! Let's get this party going! We'll all get to be big shots! Government ministers! 0 Christmas tree! 0 Christmas tree! How are thy leaves so verdant! Not only in the summertime, But even in winter is thy prime. 0 Christmas tree! 0 Christmas tree! How are thy leaves so verdant! Cheers! - Cheers! O thou happy, 0 thou holy, Glorious peace-bringing Christmas time... We're all messed up, Liesbeth. Completely messed up. Nothing can help us anymore. Mr. Lattereit isn't at home now. - But the Frankes live here! Mrs. Franke moved out after Max was arrested. Where's she living now? She's staying with friends at 7 Papier-Strasse. - Thanks. I think their name is Raschke. Hello. Do the Frankes live here? They're all out. When will they be back? - I don't know. Toni! - Hello. Max isn't here. I know where he is. I tried to find you at your old place. We moved away from there ages ago. If it hadn't been for the Raschkes, me and the boy would've been lost. But we still have some friends. Take care. Goodbye. Would you take this to the Raschkes? - OK. For Mrs. Franke, OK? The Red Front, we'll break them in two! Clear the streets, the SA's on the move! ...the endless columns of the SA. I'm reporting on the grandiose SA march in front of the Karl Liebknecht House. We've never seen the likes of this before! Listen for yourselves to the boundless enthusiasm of these patriotic Germans! Honestly, I could almost make out my own voice! What a march, eh? The Communists are trembling at the knees. - Three beers! What's the matter? In a bad mood at our victory march? A fine victory. More like first-class funeral. A police escort on all sides. Put a sock in it, brother-in-law. You call that a victory march? No, thanks. I'd rather not march at all than hang on the police's apron strings. And why exactly are we provoking the workers? We should be marching past the Deutsche Bank, Wertheim's department store and the fat cats' villas in Dahlem! And not just that. - What else? We should take back what they've stolen! - You're talking like a Red! What do you mean? That's what you said yourself. It doesn't hold true anymore. Now it's time to bargain! But don't you worry your pretty head about things you don't understand. Your strengths lie elsewhere. - Who are we bargaining with? What do you think? Our Fijhrer is bargaining with Chancellor Papen. My dear friend... you really don't have a clue about politics. Don't make a fool of yourself. You're drunk. - Shove off! We should seize power with weapons in our hands! Not by crawling and bargaining! That's just terrific! Minimum- thinks he can teach us veterans how to fight for Germany's future! And you think you know how? - I most certainly do. We'll show what we're capable of. It's high time Adolf Hitler came to power. JANUARY 30, 1933 ...and on this evening to think only of Germany and the German people! Sieg! - Heil! Good morning! Did you sleep well? Mrs. Kaluweit! Good morning. - Morning. The Sturmfijhrer has already left. He has special duty today. Please feed the baby for me... I'm still tired. -You stay in bed, I'll see to him. Don't make such a fuss. I'll give you your breakfast in a minute. I thought you'd have a lie-in today, so I already set the milk on the stove. And so you should. All right, we're going now. I've always said, Herr Hitler... All right, breakfast's coming right up... ...and your... ...beauty drove me wild. COMMUNIST ATTACK! KILLED IN THE ATTACK WERE SCHARFUHRER PAUL SCHRCHDDER AND... it was a crazy night from the start. A march through a Red neighborhood was ordered as a show of strength. Paul didn't want to go along. Why not? - You know why, Liesbeth. He'd done nothing but complain lately. He told Kaczmierczik we should discuss things with the Communists first. That's a completely different kettle of fish. That's how it was that evening. Maybe his intuition warned him in advance. Your Red friends... They showed their gratitude by shooting him. No. If you don't believe me, here it is in black and white: "Reds continue their killing spree! Scharfijhrer Schriider shot in the back!" I'm really sorry. I always warned you about them. Now they've even murdered your brother. At the end of February, a few days before Paul's funeral, Lissy received an unexpected visit. Heil Hitler! So late in the evening, Mr. Kaczmierczik? - Yes... Mrs. Kaluweit. What significance this visit would have for her... she could not have guessed. Freddi won't be back till tomorrow morning. So I'll keep you company... All evening... WHERE Big things are in the offing. You can take my word for it... Madam Lissy. Our time has come. You know... I can speak openly with you. When our Fijhrer became Chancellor... I had a talk with the Doctor. And do you know what he said? "Kacz", he said... Goebbels always calls me Kacz... "Kacz", he said... "This is the last electoral campaign we'll conduct from the district office. Afterwards we'll be moving... to our own ministry of propaganda. And you Kacz, I'll make you a head of department. That's a promise." It's terribly hot in here. Eh? What do you think of me, Madam Lissy? You can't understand, Madam Lissy. My feelings... But that's the way it's always been. We got engaged under a Christmas tree. Elm] She had almost the same blonde mop of curls as you and the same walk. But later, when money was short... and I didn't have enough to pay for movie tickets and pastries... she simply upped and left me. Just upped and left me. And do you know what became of her? She became... I can't bring myself to say it. She met her death during a brawl among some sailors... in the red-light district of Hamburg. Yes, Madam Lissy... That's life... WEI... and brutal. At first I wanted to drown myself... But then I thought better of it and went into politics. It's a load of baloney, too. I haven't done badly so far... But you never can tell. Everyone has his own destiny. It could happen to me, too... TO think that... your own people can simply shoot you down from behind. We've seen it all before. It's down to fate... Just like Paul. Poor kid. What? What did you say? Madam Lissy, I'm drunk! What do you mean about Paul and his own people? I'm starting to see ghosts. How about a drink? I asked you: What happened to Paul? A rumor... nothing more. I didn't put it very well. I understood you perfectly well. Well? Yes? Yes? What? Freddi! The Reichstag's on fire. What? The Reichstag's on fire... Mrs. Kaluweit! Have you heard? They've set the Reichstag on fire. - Who? Who do you think? The Communists, of course! The Reds! The Reds. That's the last straw! Now we'll hit back! We'll get rid of anyone who stands in our way. Do you understand? Now the fur will really fly! Moses! No! No! Please, no! So you won't do anything for him? I wouldn't dream of helping someone who was arrested for subversion. The Jews are involved in these attacks. - They beat him up when they arrested him. He probably resisted arrest and deserved it. No. They just hit him. - So what? It's not important. Bigger things are at stake now: Germany's future! Do you understand? Germany's future! Germany's future... Was it possible that she'd loved him once? Had she ever really been close to him? It was unimaginable that she had once believed that in his arms she could forget and find everything. That was then. But what about now? It's not important. Bigger things are at stake... Germany's future! Do you understand? Germany's future! He'd become almost like a stranger to her. She was disgusted by his hands, which seemed stained with blood. The emptiness that surrounded her was devoid of hope. Where could she find the firm ground she needed to carry on living? Excuse me. - You can't go in there. I just want to visit the Raschkes, my friend is staying with them. You can't see her anymore. You've come too late. That was Mrs. Franke. A truckload of Nazis turned up the day before yesterday. Her husband managed to get away... but she had a heart attack. - And their child? That's none of your business, madam. Lissy? I thought it was the SA again. - What's the matter? I can't go on. I can't go on. What's the matter? Why don't you let her in? Let the general's wife see what they did! That's what your precious nation looks like, your "reawakened Germany". Twelve snotty-nosed brats in SA uniforms came in here! All armed to the teeth! And shouting: "The slightest resistance and we'll shoot. This is war!" Where were they when I got wounded? In the Vosges? In Rumania? In the Forest of Argonne? That's the end of that, then. Today they got the union stamps, tomorrow the whole union. And it's all our fault. Always retreating from one lesser evil to another, always sticking to the democratic rules of the game, even though the others don't give a damn about them. Now the bandits in brown are on top, and they'll tear the skin from our bodies. So you're still here? Keeping an eye on us, eh? What are you waiting for? Go to your SA and tell them what you heard here! And tell them we'll be wiser next time. M]... You've got him on your conscience, too. Your Fromeyer and you. 5311351162515 Go and tell them! Farewell, faithful comrade Paul Schréder. And what's your answer, Mr. Kaczmierczik? Madam Lissy. Not here, not now. Frightened. We understand the family's terrible grief and share it with them. Together. But don't forget that sacrifices such as this are made for Germany. Sure... Everything you do is for Germany. ...It's also a question of the honor and hygiene of the nation! You murderers! Everyone has to decide. You're either with us... or against us! Yes, everyone has to decide. And Lissy now knew that you can be lonely but still not forsaken. She knew there was a way, a difficult and arduous way, but an honest way. Each one of us has to walk this path for himself, but no one walks it alone. Subtitling by SUBS Hamburg Michael Hale
