Don't joke about it. Will you marry me? Well, will you? Will you be my, what was it? Wi... Wive... Wife...? You're silly. You know... Heniek took a fall today... ... forever and a day. He always had holes in his socks. He wouldn't let his wife stitch them up... so his feet could breath. He used to sweat badly. Holey Heniek. About the wedding, I'm not jok... Do you want to marry her? I'm asking you. Do you want to marry her? That's my business. She trusts you. What do you mean? Has mum been nagging again? If you start it you finish it. Not like your father. Right... it's sorted. You start at five tomorrow morning. If there was a bridge you'd be five minutes from home. It's too big. I also have some ladies' things...

The next fight is Garlik v's Kwiecinski.. Place your bets at 4-1 and win. All those willing to fight please step up to the ring. Good fight, Wojtek. 1 feel like something sweet. If I wanted I could lose seven kilos in a day. - I mean it. You don't believe me? - I believe you. May 1? I'm Dariusz Gazda... that was a weak fight but you're fast. Maybe you'd like to work for me? I run a security agency. I'd also be willing if possible. Think about it. - You could've had a word... - What do you mean? 1 don't know... that we do everything together... That we're pals. Baton! Come back! Baton! I'm getting the beers in! - Coach? Someone's been at my locker. - It's not your locker anymore. Get your stuff together. What's going on? You don't need to train for what you're doing. You fight for money, this is a club! There's no place for you here. - He didn't take part in any fights! - Shut it, or you'll be out as well. The boy can stay. Yours. Get changed and get in the gym. I'll be back after training. - I don't want to without you. - Didn't I just say? What are you stood staring at? Why don't you lose some weight! You were supposed to stay and train, right? Mum won't let me! Get him down. - Get out! - Get the fuck off! Get out! More decision mate. What are you staring at! Get the fuck out! 1 said get the fuck out! But Granddad it's a good job. A good job? You've got a good job down the pig farm. It's solid, fixed work. 1 sorted it for you, remember that. Now some bloke comes along, gives you a sniff of the money... ... and you're off like a shot. She's turned his head. It's not about her. Why do want her kind with a kid? Ask yourself. She's older, unemployed, homeless. And she's Ukrainian. - Excuse me? - When were you born? Me? You. 16 May 1987. Sixteen... Five... Nineteen... Eight... Seven. 1 play the lottery every week. It's a long time habit. What are you waiting for? Thank you. Be at the office tomorrow for nine. Mister..? I've got a mate... he's big and looking for work... Maybe you could take him on... on a ... trial basis... at least? - Your mate? - Yes. Let him come along. Thank you. I've got a job. - Nice. - You're coming too. 1 sorted it for you. Really? - Fucking sorted, thanks! - Relax, you're on trial... Seeya. - Where you going? Let's get a brew! - Eight o'clock tomorrow, my place. Oi! Off to see Mrs Hand and her five lovely daughters!? Hello. Katja! I've got a job! For real money, you hear me? - Real work... - Slowly, slowly... In a security agency. They do all the parties in town. Ladies and Gentlemen, you can see our makeup on the screen... Please feel free to come up and see our visagiste's work... Thank you very much! She's just finished a customer, thank you, have a nice day. Are you mad? Don't be silly. Wojtek! Don't be silly! What are you doing? Big demand! Buzz it round. What is it? Gear bruv', gear. Gazda doesn't allow it. Gazda? You're scared of the Old Knot? Did your brain go soft in that cement works? Take it and buzz it. You say thank you very much... ... but I don't use it. Baton, 25 zlotys commission. 20. 25! You fucking mental? Soz. You did it on purpose. Wojtek... Move your arses. Tie them up here. Come here. What are you gawping at? Never seen a shooter? You never can tell on the job. It's all the same if you hit a bloke in the head or the heart... ... the thing is to hit him at all. Baton, maybe you can do it. Two hands or it'll recoil. Why are you sweating like a pig? You scared? Just pick one and bang. Fuck! You fucking about? Are you some fucking muppet tree-hugger?! And? Bang. 1 won't be working as a security guard anymore. How's that? The boss doesn't like me. But he liked you. Not anymore. All right!? What's happening? You don't come to work. It's not for me. And this is? Here you go. - What's this? - Your cut. I've no idea what the hell made you jack in the job. Well, I'll do one... Wait up. Two tone. Birds drop their knickers at it. It's really shitty here! My Grandma had the same... ... only dad broke it. Miss your dad do you? No, I don't want to see him. 1 thought your dad had died? 1 thought your dad died in an accident? Yes, he died in an accident. - Do you think about him? - Who? Your husband. Why do you ask? Do you send him money? 1 don't understand. Andriy told me. So that's why you're with me. For the money. It's not like that. You're acting the part of a poor lonely Ukrainian with a kid. You thought you'd found yourself a loser you could sponge off. Sponge off? You've got nothing to sponge from. Look at yourself... you've got nothing. You can't even be a security guard. Your Granddad fixed you a job in the cement works and the farm... When will pack that job in? You're irresponsible and childish. Andriy! Wojtek! I'm sorry. I don't think those things. I'm sorry. 1 have a husband. I'm not divorced. It's all true. He used to hit me and Andriy. 1 ran away from him... 1 came here. I thought it'd be better for Andriy. - Why didn't you tell me? - I didn't know how. 1 can't take any more. The job, the old woman... the fact that Andriy can't go to school like other children. I'm frightened I'll have to go back. - Hello. - Hello. Is Dariusz Gazda home? Yes, please come in. Dragon, someone for you! Kill him, kill the Dragon! You kill the Dragon in the head! - In the heart! Quickly, shoot! - Don't be a coward! Now, kill him now! With the laser! It's your only chance! Shoot him! Quickly, now! Kill him! That's enough, the Dragon's tired. Go see your mum, quickly, quickly. Don't ever come here again. If you want me then go to the office. I'm sorry. What's this about? I'd like you to take me on again. Hanka, get me some more warm soup would you? How do I know you won't pull my dick again? No, not this time. 1 promise. Is that enough Dragon? - Perhaps you're hungry? - He's on his way out. You've got courage coming here. You're intelligent. You might amount to something yet. Only if you listen of course. All right. Kalafior will tell you what's going on. Attack! Defend yourself! Keep the engine running. Baton. Go. Go! Gently for fuck's sake! Stop complaining scum! What're you saying? Don't fuck me about! Time to pay back what you took for those bearded gnomes of yours! You've got three days. - Fuck, he shit himself. - Let's go. What about him? We're just leaving him like this? Do you want this piece of shit in the car? Front. Hook. To the jaw. Scythe. Body blow. Liver. - Grad! - Guard, guard! And the winner is Andriy Radchenko! You were supposed to be teaching him Polish not punching. - Wojtek teaches me all the time! -I can see what he teaches you. Mum I don't want to be here anymore! When are we going back to Grandma? - Grandma will come to us. - Why are you lying? - Speak Polish! - I don't want to speak Polish! It's here. He's probably burrowing somewhere in the ground. Right, keep lookout. He might come back. Let's go! What the fuck Mr Mole? You thought you'd dig a fucking hole in the ground? Please, please! Take it easy. Nothing's going on. No one's fucking asking you. You got done over by a bunch of rag-pickers. The moles came out of their holes. You fucked it up without the money. - They all had tools. - Shut it. Who was on lookout? Wojtek spotted him. 1 was sure he'd checked it all out. - Did you go there beforehand? - No. Did you show them the ropes and the basics? - I thought... - I haven't finished. You didn't teach him the rules. You were supposed to teach him the job. Knowing you, you just showed them the shooter and that's all. Go and wash the car. Well? Go and help him. How did you get out without a scratch? Firstly, you have to do reconnaissance. You have to know everything about the client and his family... ... when he eats, when he sleeps, when he goes for a shit and so on. Conversation first. Talk to him and give him a fair deadline. When that doesn't work you punch his lights out on entry. He has to know the jokes are over. Never sort it out in the presence of women and children. Understood? That's a sacred rule. What's that pile of planks doing on the veranda? You're here to build not create a rubbish dump. Lock the family in the bathroom, the bog, wherever. The bloke's got to worry more about his family than he does himself. You tie a knot over his head with his shirt. If he puts up a fight you can break his kneecaps. No one's ever failed to pay back money after that treatment. If you meet a hard man you can stick a curling tongue up his arse. But I generally prefer more psychological methods. Although a curling tongue up the arse is also psychological. Look how they're fouling up the work. Is that evenly laid? Nice here isn't it? 1 haven't got it. The flowers aren't selling. I'll have it in a month. Our client says you've been putting it off for six months already. I'll talk to him about it. Not you. He doesn't want to talk about it. He'd like his money back in a week. In a month, after the new harvest. - You don't understand... - No, you don't understand. - Wiesiu, there's pruning to be done. - In a sec. Nice little family. Do you think I'm fucking frightened of you? You think you're going to blackmail me? Get out of my yard! Go on, fuck off. Fuck off. - You've got a week. - I'll set the dogs on you shitheads! What're you looking at? Jump in. Wicked! Quickly, quickly... - Where'd you get it? - I didn't steal it, come on. Wojtek? Wait, wait, wait, not yet. Now. We're going to live here. I rented it. Do you like it? It's beautiful. Huge. You won't have to listen to the old woman's moaning any more. This will be the dining room. Come on, come on... And this will be Andriy's room. This will be our bedroom. Who's that? - May I? - Please come in. This is for a good start in a new place. - Hello, Dariusz Gazda. - Hello, Katja Riadchenko. - Well, and? Do we like it? - Yes, a lot. Thank you for the loan, without it I couldn't pay the deposit. - I'll give it back when... - Don't worry about it. - I'll get going, goodbye. - Goodbye. - The Boss? - Yeah. That's her. Wait. What for? It's all clear. Bloody hell. I'll miss the scuffle. You've got three days. Understood? Three days. - There's some soup. - I'm not hungry. - Is everything all right? - Yeah. Is there anything to eat? What? What's going on? What should be? 1 don't know, I'm asking. - I'm frightened Wojtek. - What're you talking about? They threw you out. Now you work there again. You don't talk to me. How did you get that job back? Someone left. I'm telling you, I was lucky. Someone left. Andriy, put the veil down! What've you done you little bugger! - Look what he's done! - Don't ever shout at him again! Understood? Ever! The B-52s are flying! The Americans are hiding... - those thugs behind their tanks! - I don't make models anymore. It's not for you! - Andriy look at this, a B-52. - Cool. Thank you. Please come on in. Pass me the ball! Come on! Good afternoon. 1 would like to give this back and to apologise. What the fuck are you playing at? Are you giving it back to me or the client? Did I lend you the bloody money? Make an appointment with the bloke and give it back to him. Just tell me where and when so I can watch you do it. I'm sorry. Andriy, come on! Hey boys! Pass the ball! Me and Andriy versus everyone else. Don't. Who was that bloke? Which bloke? The one in the yard. What did he want? A friend from the cement works. Leave it out. I'm not an idiot. 1 saw him. Who was he? It's none of your business. I lent him some money at the disco. He came to give it back. He had some problems. That's all. You're getting worked up over nothing. It's all right. Baton, what happened? Sorry Boss, I... - Nothing happened. - Shut your trap! Wojtek? 1 don't know. You're standing up for a lost cause. 1 didn't give you the car to keep this muck in it! Tie them knots. Paws out. Paws. Paws. Paws. Paws! I'm telling you Wojtek... ... family is the most important thing. Only family counts. Everything else is just shit. You know, there's only one thing that frightens me... The only thing... That my children will one day pay for who I am. That's the only thing that frightens me. What do you want Wojtek? Do you want whores? Do you want a fucking amazing bitch? No... You can ask for anything you want. 1 need papers for Katja. - Papers? - Yes. Permanent residence, a work permit... - ..everything that's necessary. - Done. It's in the bank. And now we're going to see some whores. But Boss, I've got a girlfriend. And I have a wife. Say that again! Trying to be hard are we, Russkie? What the fuck are you doing here? You don't even know how to smoke! Go back to Russia. Stop shoving me! What're you doing? What's going on? Where's Andriy? Where is he? In the hospital. He's got a broken arm. How? What happened? He was sticking up for you in the yard, They called you a gangster. They said you beat people up. Is that what you do? Is it? You've been having me on, lying to me all the time. Don't you understand 1 do it for you. And for Andriy. Gazda just has to fix all the papers, don't you get it? I never asked you to do that, never! Put that down. What are you doing? Where are going? Put it down. What do you think you're going to do?! Are you going to show your arse down at the peep-show?! Katja! Katja, wait! You can just fuck off! Fuck off! Guard up! These are for you. It's true that you're a hood? Of course I'm not. You know me. She loves you. You'll kill him! There'll be no one left to give the money back! Let's get the fuck out of here! You've lost the plot mate. What's eating you? Fucked off cos Gazda fixes everything with me? Katja... 1 did it. Look. Your name. Everything you need. Signatures... stamps... Come on... let's go home. I'm not going anywhere with you. It doesn't make sense... you've nowhere to live. Your Granddad helped me, I can live with him until I find something. Did Granddad fix you your papers? You baby, you thought I was with you for the papers? If you don't come back, you can forget about these. Katja? Katja... Don't you want these documents? - They're legal. - No. So why did you come here? Please leave Wojtek be. 1 don't understand. You understand perfectly well. Please let him go. Let him go? Why? There's no reason to. He's a good worker. Why are you doing this? Why are you toying with him? You're in charge why do you need him? 1 think he needs me. He wants to work for me. What is it you want? Bring him over. And the winner is Nowy... Second round knock out... Please step up and collect your winnings... We're taking bets for the next fight... The Kid v's Thunderer at 3-2! Don't come home again. I don't give a shit what happens to you... ... but don't come near Katja and the little one! It's going to be your way again is it? You want to put everyone's life in order again? You think I don't know why Dad went away? Because of you, you hear me? Because of you! You stick your nose into everything! Into every little thing! Mum just couldn't ever stand up to you! Do you hear me? 1 could never stand making fucking model planes, you hear!? Never! Kill the Dragon! Kill him! Kill the Dragon! Kill him! Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday dear Wojtek! Happy birthday to you! Come on, what are you standing there for? All the best! Thank you... thank you very much... There's still something missing. Do you like it? - You'll get used to it. - Thank you. Wojtek, 1 wish you every success in life. 1 hope you have a family like this one. Or even bigger! Move over here. By the wall, the wall! Move! Mind out the way! Be quiet, and get off me! Please, one more month, please! I'll straighten it all out. Please... I'm begging you. I'll give it back... Don't be hysterical, you don't believe that... - Have you got a court ruling?! - I don't give a shit about courts! How can you? He's an old man! Yeah? You can take him in, what's the problem? - Please, I'm begging you! - Please get off me. This place belongs to me. What's this? Get this bed out of here! Do something about him! Nowy, Baton?! Mister, get up! Bloody hell, I'm not paying you to make requests! - Maybe he can't fucking hear? - He can hear everything. Please... I'm begging you... Well, what're you waiting for? Please... I'm begging you... Stop! Stop! Wojtek! Come and play! Wojtek, come on! Play! 1 want to show you something. It's me. You can't see Dad very well because Granddad took it. They'll be back soon. You hear me? They'll be coming back. This doesn't make sense. I'll find your other sock. Wojtek? What? 1 don't trust you any more. I'm frightened all the time. 1 have to leave. Bombs away! Defend yourself, Granddad! The B52s are flying! Nose dive! Directed by Director of Photography Written by Edited by Sound Design Cast
