Presented by "Tokyo Serendipity" Partners ARAGAKI Yui MATSUDA Ryuhei KIKUCHI Rinko A safe neighborhood. It's my first time living on my own. I'm looking for a place for two, with my girlfriend. I'd like a room where the morning light filters in. No! I was with my sister, not with my boyfriend! The room will be demolished soon. Tokyo Serendipity We are the "Hercules Moving Company"! Coming. We'll do our best today! "We drop foes, not your valuables!" "We drop foes, not your valuables!" Be careful! Be careful! Be cautious! We drop things... ...only in the ring! Be cautious! We drop things... ...only in the ring! Excuse me. Coming through. Sorry. Be careful! We drop things... ...only in the ring! Yes, only in the ring. Nice and easy. 4 months ago "Sister, your cafe's opening in 90 days! "May this chair bring you lots of customers - Yui" I'm home. Oh... Hi! Open up! Better hurry up! I'm working on it. Wait a second. Any congratulations? How about, "I am happy for your shotgun marriage"? What? Are you saying I must live alone here? What about the cafe? What are you going to do about it? It was you who asked me for the chair's design. Are you dropping your dream for this...'? So uncool! Cool doesn't matter when you are in love. Right? Hey, Miss. Just relax and let us do the work. Be safe! Be careful! We drop things... ...only in the ring! Be safe! Here we go! Be safe! Be safe! Next! Another one! They go right next to the bed. Place it by the window there, please. This is the last one. I did it... Oh, no... What am I gonna do? What's up? Hey, Satan! You must explain... I did it. We only drop things in the ring, but... I did it. Oh, my... Say, let's go for it. Let's present her with THAT! Our apologies, ma'am. Oh, no, it was an accident. But we must... Right. We must compensate. Here you are. "Knockdown in a second! SHW Survival Series" "Knockdown in a second! SHW Survival Series" Please accept them. Please accept them. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you for everything. Have a nice day! Bye, Goodbye. Good day. Excuse us. We'll be expecting you backstage. No way... "NODA Kitsuko" I'm coming. Nice to meet you, I have just moved in next door. AOKI Yui. I am NODA Kitsuko. Delighted to meet you. You're a student? Yes. At the art school, Oh, really. Here's a little something. Oh, a hospitality gift? It's rare to see such courtesy. Your mother raised you well. Like, my nails are like this, I can't cook, y'know? See ya. I can't come to the door right now. Who is it? My name is.. ...AOKI Yui. I have just moved into 303 today. Number 303? Yes. Right below yours. Here is a little something... ...I hope you like this. When did you sign the contract? Oh, never mind... I'm in the middle of some work. Excuse me. What was that? You lied, mom! Only one person accepted the gift. Haven't spoken to her since. No idea. Hello? I'm not gonna go to her wedding! Excuse me, I'm AOKI. The agency told you I'd be coming by? Hey, watch it. Some nails are sticking out. Are you OK? Yes. Sorry, Don't be. It's fine. You're here for the thing you left behind? I didn't see it. Would you like to check? Sorry lo trouble you. I will leave as soon as I find it. Excuse me, And excuse me for this, The desk? Let me use the chair, What? Hey, what the...'? A fireplace? There it is! Amazing! Thank you very much, Wait, what's the deal? Do you like gadgets like this? I love gadgets. I do, too. I never knew. Oh, I see. This is what they told me! They said, "Don't move the shelf, it's old and dangerous." But it is fine if you push it up like this. That's the beauty of these old buildings. Functional, yet playful. It is such a waste to demolish this. Oh, hi, Sachi! The day after tomorrow is our "Timber Trade Fair" class? We have to go to the countryside? How much is the train fare? I don't know. I need to check it. Hey, it's the competition. Yui, you're going to enter, right? The competition... Well, I may pass this time. "SMILING CHAIR by JUNDA Atsuko" "SMILING CHAIR by JUNDA Atsuko" You have keen eyes to notice it. You have keen eyes to notice it. It was love at first sight. Smiling chair. H was my graduation work. I just made what I wanted. So, I don't think I can give you decent advice. It's not my expertise. You are not a chair designer? No. I am an architect. And I will go abroad to study in India soon. Go abroad... I need to finish up my work within a month to go there. Is it OK with you? Thank you for your kindness. It's the cell phone. What's the material? I once thought about steel and leather. But I am more inclined to use wood now. Wood is interesting. It has special textures. See the curve? It didn't bend in the way I wanted at first. Ah! I think I still have the drafts... Wait a sec. Thank you. "Feng-Shui for Girls: Pink-tinted items for your love!" "Feng-Shui for Girls: Pink-tinted items for your love!" Pink... Can I help you? Huh? Oh! Sorry. Oh, I see, I see. I'm on the wrong floor. Take a close look at the woods. And don't disrupt the business, Now, go out on your own. When will the job start? Tomorrow I wish I could have a short term casual job like that. 2 weeks max. I can't deal with people at work. I gotta find a job because I spent a lot on moving. Hey, any cool neighbors? None! Oh, there are quite a few, really. I come here every time. It is the largest in the Tokyo area. You can't miss it, What? Is that Yui's type? A bargain, for non-radial cuts. Your dad must be really proud of you, huh? You're such a fine young man, Takashi-chan! Takashi-chan? Takashi-chan, how much can it be? OK, OK, which one? Oh, my. What should I do? Why? Why are you running? I haven't run since the 5th grade! Aw... Ouch! "Forestry Resources Development Lab," Excuse me... TOKUDA-san got injured and..., I come here for her. Oh, please come here AOKI-san, Hold on. Hello? Caught me at a bad time. I'll call you hack. Yes, yes. Thank you. We've been waiting for you. Please come in. Please have a seat. I am TANAKA, the head of the lab. We need your help for our presentation in 2 weeks. You are an art student, aren't you? Yes, I am. So, for now, let's start by... You are...? Hello. Hello. Do you know her, Professor? Professor? This is AOKI-san, your assistant for the presentation. Our time is limited. Let's work together and get things done. Let's do it, AOKI-san, please take a look at this while I explain. It is a study to create organic phosphors from Conifer. See, the green isn't bright enough. Matched with other colors, white light could be created for practical use. But it's really difficult. Forest management has been quite sloppy in general. Too many conifers. Cedar pollen allergies are quite pervasive. Are you allergic to it? A little. I've noticed it since I came to Tokyo. Must be hard to deal with. In fact, most cedars planted now are modified to produce less pollen. In 50 years or so, cedar pollen will be 1/3 of what it is now. You'll be fine. Oh, right. Our challenge is how much we can experiment with the limited amounts we have. Good evening, Hello, you're home. Well, I must get going. Off you go! About these... Yes? The incubation room is filled with conifers for the presentation. So I brought these home. I don't know if it's a good idea but... ...AOKI-san, is your pit full? Would you mind helping me with these? The apartment has some convenient functions. One will fit into the pit. There you go. "The pit"? It's "the pit"! Someone's left this? A drape? Atsuko-san, why did you move out of the room? To prepare for the trip to India. I could sleep at the office, I thought. But it actually wasn't a good idea. Then I found this place. The pre-demolition rent rate was really a bargain. But why didn't you stay at your old place until you left for India? Why did you move? You have to throw things away a little recklessly when you move. You are lucky, not being thrown away. Why did you choose the room, AOKI-san? I had to get away from my sister and wanted to live near my school. And the Meguro river, probably. So it is your first time living alone. More convenient for your boyfriend, huh? No! I don't have a boyfriend! You are kidding! Don't mind me. Atsuko-san, do you have a boyfriend? A boyfriend... a soon-to-be-ex-boyfriend, anyway... Soon-to-be ex? Can you stay in a relationship when you aren't needed? Having a sense that someone is complete without you? The list goes on and on. It could be an otaku quality every man has that sets women off, I am for otaku... ...Or a man who's very passionate about something. I like that kind. The chair. It's a two-seater! Oh, please. Don't overinterpret it. Stop that! Love permeates anything a person hears, sees or does. It's the infatuation stage of the relationship. It's not like that! After the drawing, just make the real-size model to get the feeling. Such a total shuffle. It's a Tokyo mystery. "The Ringside" 'The Battle oi Fate!"' Atsuko-san? Do you know about Super Hercules Pro-Wrestling? "Her-a-Wres"? What about it? If you are into this, do you want to go with me? Yes, definitely! Good evening, Oh, hello. Are they doing well? The seeds for the experiment. Yes, kept in the dark and watered, just as you asked. Oh, this. I am going to make a real-size model for... ...A chair I designed. A wooden chair. Wooden chairs are wonderful. The type of wood determines a chair's personality. I've met some craftsmen who work with wood. They said not just the color but scent were the parts of the design. "Beauty of the Lumber" Oh? The wrong person. "TO JUNDA Atsuko" It's for the former resident. I see. She hasn't reported her address change. Don't throw it away. What? She might come back to get it. But she is... You normally keep such things. You normally wouldn't throw away someone else's stuff. Yes, normally. That's true. But.. Can I.. ...Keep it? That's my girlfriend's. She suddenly moved out without notice. We were supposed to live together. I guess it can be a hint to track her. I can't let you. Good night. Well, around there... Let's go with the deep joint. And that part should be... Don't like coriander? You didn't notify the post office that you'd moved. It's like you are running away from something. Sorry for the trouble. I will contact the post office. Why are you going abroad to study? You are skilled enough not to have to go and study, Is there a reason you don't want to be in Japan? There are a bunch of first-class architects like me how, So I thought I would start all over. But why do you have to go now? India is so hot. From modern buildings to classics like the Taj Mahal, or mosques... There rs so much variety. Many of my friends are already there studying, I can live there and improve my skills. Then I want to build good homes. Good homes... Yup. Like... The roof is smiling! The wall is smiling! Dad, Mom and kid are smiling! Something like that. Your girlfriend went away without telling you? That's right. Can you normally do that? From this you can tell she isn't really a girlfriend? Were you really going out with her? Of course, Are you thinking I am a stalker? We had signed the contract for the room to live together. And I had decided not to return home, What did you do with the letter? I gave it to the superintendent. He didn't give me her new address when I asked. Does he actually know where she is? He should know, normally. Kita-Shinagawa is the best! Hooray for Highway 1 of the Edo era! What a great town! I almost left here without experiencing such good stuff. Thanks. You aren't a real resident here without visiting the shop. Really! You're probably right. Where is it? By the station? I want to go there. It's around the corner from the eel restaurant. Why don't you go with your "soon-to-be-ex" before leaving Japan? I mean the person..., ...Does he really Know it's "almost over"? Of course. He has to be back on a mountain in Nara by March. He should have done it sooner, but couldn't decide. Back on a mountain? Yeah. He is the first son of a landowner family. A landowner? Yup. They've got a mountain. A landowner... A landowner... I kind of like it. The family thing. They are planting trees now for generations to come, Doesn't it sound so proper? But the bottom Mme is, our timeframes are so different, With him, I felt so small. But then suddenly he asked me to live together. Please live with me. So unexpected... so poorly timed... It was such a tough blow. It was really fatal, you know. PLEASE! LIVE WITH ME! Oops, sorry. The strings are tightly woven. The heads grow fonder, but they keep missing each other. What will happen... ...if you get them together for heaven's sake? Got that? H you get them together", A rolled up cigarette," "Masu-Ou-Ken Confectionery" Such a classy place. It is an old establishment from the Edo era. I wonder if there is sweet bean paste in Spain. Say what? I ran into her former colleague the other day. She moves a lot with her job, so I asked him where she could be. I was told Spain. Spam? I knew she wanted to go abroad, but... ...She likes Japanese sweets like this. Must wonder how she could leave Japan so easily, I have no idea... "I'm still at the construction site. Sorry! (Scratching head)" Is someone coming? No... My goodness, "So sorry. Maybe a raincheck for another time? (Bowing)" What's wrong? Nothing, Shall we go back? Atsuko-san, I was actually... at the confectionery... Atsuko-san, I was... I'm all charged! S-A-T-A-N! Satan! Go and get 'em! "Satan" Thanks. Thank you so much, AOKI-san. Now I can leave without regrets. It doesn't look good... How is it going, professor? Is it green enough? There's no time to gather more field samples. Right. I'll take a chance at some gardening stores. Take a chance? I've already told them we'd show the completed form. See? See? I trust you, Professor! I'll go over to the site now and do setups for the presentation. Please take care of the rest. Have some Thank you. But, no thanks. What did you do with the chair? Huh? I'll leave it here, Leave it here. You leave it here... ...Because you don't need it? Because I cherish it. Oh, what exactly am I supposed to do, now? Now, hush, don't worry. Follow your instinct and draw it, see? Cherish", If you leave it here, someone might steal it. It's possible, right? It's yours, if you don't mind. The chair. You can have it. Ah, the chair. How's that? It will be great. I can't take it. Why? A nuisance? I can keep it until you come back. If it's OK. Really? Thank you! So happy to hear that! Wouldn't it be better to attend the wedding? Your sister will feel sad if you are not there. It's your phone... No bother. It's not work. When's the wedding? In March. She is 28 and it's a shotgun marriage. So embarrassing! She is 28... And you are so harsh. I hate it when my elders have less sense than I do. When I already have too much to deal with. You have lots on your mind. It's tough to be 20. Many things happen. Many things happen at 20? I would say so. But when I look back, I really want to say this, "You are so deeply distressed, "but you will get over it soon. Don't worry!" And I wish me at 35 would come from the future... ...To tell me the words... Ah, dream on! Alter all, your mind can never be enlightened all at once. Instead, you're gelling wiser little by little. The sky is smiling. The wind is smiling. The bike is smiling. And the bag is smiling. I like this! The bridge is smiling, and... ...The billboard is smiling. The kids are smiling. Their school bags are smiling, The dog is smiling. His poop is smiling. And the red light is smiling. It's done! All done! Now, let's do our best tomorrow! Professor, it is fine. It was shining alright. I didn't want to resort to lowering the level of red and blue for green... The device was shining a bright, sharp and crisp white. Right, AOKI-san? It was close to perfection. We could prove its potential for practical use with brighter green... What will you do with the solutions? I'll bring them to the site. You can never be too cautious. I see. Then I will take the device. It's such a heavy thing... Right, AOKI-san? We needed more time... A decade should be spent on the experiments, if possible... It was close, you said? Well, there is only a limited amount of green extract, anyway. We will try another time, taking more time. But, there is some, isn't there? We have until 2 p.m. tomorrow. Why don't we try whatever we can now? Please.
