(PAOLO EXHALES DEEPLY) This belongs to the girl from earlier, I'm leaving it here. - (Man) Just a second, I need to give you the form. - What form? (Man) Your girlfriend signed, we're discharging her. (Paolo) Where do you live? Not here. I came with my boyfriend. - And where is he? - We had a fight. - You want to call him? - You have his number? I lost my bag at the club and everything was in it. Do you know somewhere nice? You know that you're pregnant, right? - What the fuck do you want? - You should have stayed there, not here. (SHE HITS THE SEAT) (Paolo) Hey! (Paolo) Hey! (SOFT MUSIC) - What's your name? - Mia. (INAUDIBLE) (INDISTINCT NOISE) I have to go. (DOOR OPENS) Sorry, occupied. - Can you make coffee? - I don't drink coffee. (MIA PEES) At least put some music on. You have a radio, right? No. Listen, I have to go to work. Relax. My boyfriend is waiting for me, we have rehearsal. Perfect. - Can you give me a lift? - To where, sorry? Like, Asti. Maybe we misunderstood each other. I have to go out 'cause I have work. I got it. But I lost my phone, my wallet, how am I supposed to do? - Me? - They were in the bag! What do I have to do with the bag? Listen, what's the big deal? It'll take you only a moment. I don't have a car, so even if I wanted to... Well, you can borrow it from a friend. You have a friend, right? (Assunta) No way. She'd tell you she's a virgin if it helped her. (Paolo) Assunta, please. She has no money, she lost her papers. She slept at my place last night. I have to bring her to her boyfriend. She's pregnant. It's your fault that she's pregnant? - No. - Eh! A bit of female solidarity. But you have to make the delivery yourself, and by 4PM. Yes. - Promised? - Promised. Thanks. (Paolo) Go. (Paolo) Left. (Mia) What a bitch! - (Mia) She's your boss? - Yes. - What's her name? - Assunta, and she's not a bitch. You figure out a lot of things from people's names. What did you say your name was? Paolo. There, exactly. You have to explain to me what a pregnant woman was doing in there. Did something bad happen? Because when something happens, you immediately know if it's good or bad? - Looks like it's closed. - Yep. - When are rehearsals? - Who knows. - When they get here, we rehearse. - What does that mean? (Paolo) I have to go. I have to go back to Turin, I'm leaving you here, sorry but... - Did you hear me? - Mm-hmm. "Mm-hmm". You think he's fucking someone else? No, are you kidding? He's about to become a father and he'd start to think about others? Is he the father? No! And who's the father? Paolo, a father is not that important. Let me take a drag, come on. (ARABIC MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND) - No. - What do you mean "no"? - Come on, that sucks, Paolo! - No, I said no, that's it. My God, I'm getting as fat as a pig. But look at these tits. And I never had them like this. Can you even make a sentence that isn't about yourself? Let's go, come on. Let's see if they've arrived. Remember what you did yesterday? Leaving me alone like a dog. (Vins) You left. - Ah, it was me? - Yes. And who the fuck is this? Who the fuck are you? Shut up, whore, I'm not talking to you. - (Mia) She's my replacement? - (Vins) Yes. (Mia) What the fuck? I'm your singer, and the one you're fucking! (Vins) Used to fuck! You know what? They can go fuck each other. They can both go fuck each other! In my opinion, they're already doing it. Oh! Ow! Are you crazy? - What the fuck did you say? - I'm driving! I'm driving! Are you going to tell me what I should do with you? I'm not your driver! Now I'm taking you home and that's it! Where do you live? Rome. Rome? Then we're going to the station and you're taking the train. Don't leave me alone. (ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Assunta... Hi... Yes. I just wanted to tell you I wasn't feeling good so I stayed home. Yes, the van is right there, don't worry. Tell him that I'm here at 9:30AM, on the dot, I put it all together myself. (CAR HORN) What? No, I'm... I'm at home. (ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Thanks. I'm sorry, OK? Bye! Where are the cigarettes? - I threw them away. - You're a moron, Paolo. Yeah. (ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Mia. Mia! - Hey. - What. We're in Rome. - I'm hungry. - You'll be home soon anyway. - You live alone or...? - No, I have two roommates. Do you get along? - Yes, we get along. - Perfect. I have two roommates who care about me. "And thank you, Paolo, for taking me to Rome." (Mia) And thank you, Paolo, for taking me to Rome. Yes, but with conviction. (together) Thank you, Paolo, for taking me to Rome. Perfect. - (Girl) Who is it? - It's me. - (Girl) Who are you looking for? - It's my house, actually. - Ah, you're the singer? - Mm-hmm. - Are Elio and Elisa here? - No, Elisa is renting me the house for the month. - Ah right, because they went on tour? - I don't know. I just know they wanted money upfront, sorry. - Alright, bye! - Sorry. Sorry! Sorry! - What are you doing? - Maybe you didn't understand, it's her house too. - Her house? It's my house, I paid for it. - Sure, but maybe let us in so we can discuss it... No. Calm down, OK? Fuck off. - Stop it! Come on, calm down! - This makes sense to you? What am I supposed to do? She paid, it's not like I can kick her out! It's not even my house. They were only hosting me. - Good evening. - Hi. - Two single rooms, please. - Unfortunately, we only have double rooms. - How much are they? - 100 euros. - For both. - No, each. Yes. Perfect. - Is that OK? - Sure. Papers, please? Don't look at me, I have nothing. OK, just your I.D. then. - (Paolo) Thank you. - I'm also giving you a small discount. Thank you. So sweet. - Is there a bar? - Yes, right behind you, there. - To have a glass of water. - There's water in the room. Well, at least you can drink, right? You always look like someone has died.

(KNOCKING ON THE DOOR) (Paolo, whispering) For fuck's sake! Which one? This one? - Thank--you. - You're wel--come. You are a good person. Who did you take me for? I'm not like that. Like what? Paolo? Can I play a song? - What music do you have? - (Paolo) No, you need to sleep. [TO: MARIO I can't give you what you want, but it doesn't mean that ] - (Paolo) Are you in bed? - (Mia) Yes. [TO: MARIO I can't give you what you want, but it doesn't mean that ] [TO: MARIO I can't give you what you want, but it doesn't mean that ] You're still like this? - Come on. - Help me. - Usually I'm very good at reading people's eyes. - Yeah? Go. But there's something in you that still escapes me. And there is something. - Did you get your heart broken? - Yes, of course. - A sad childhood. - That as well. Your parents didn't love you enough. (Paolo) Actually, I never had any. Seriously? Well, my mother exists... somewhere. But I don't know where, so it's like she doesn't. Your turn. You have to be honest at least this once. Who is the father? His name is Ettore, he lives in Naples. Does he know you're pregnant? What are you going to do? Rock your world. - Come on, lie down. Come on. - No, I don't wanna. I'm not sleepy. Come on. - Sing me a song. - No. - Come on! - No. Plus you're the singer. Come on, I can't fall asleep without a song. # The winter sea... # # is a concept that the mind doesn't contemplate. # # It's not very modern... # #...it's something that no one ever desires. # # Hotels closed... # #...posters already faded by advertising. # # Cars tracing lines on the roads... # # ...where the summer rain doesn't fall... # #...and I...

Because you, when something happens, you immediately know if it's good or bad? No, please, don't start... Paolo, please. Look, I thought about it a lot, and you know how much I care about you... ...but that's enough. Stop. The thing with Valerio is getting serious, we're really trying. I just wanted to tell you that I met someone. So you can relax, I won't bother you anymore. Good I'm happy for you. Finally, right? I really hope that you won't fuck things up with him. I hope not. I have to go because I have a lot of things to do... ...but it was nice hearing from you again. Maybe we could hang out some time, go out all four of us together, what do you think? Sure, sure. Love ya. Are you smoking? No. Bye, Mario. - (Mia) Are you leaving? - Yes. OK. Take a shower, we're going to Naples. It's right that he knows, then you'll decide together.

It's not fine like this! It's not fine like this! It's! Not! Fine! Like! Thiiis! (MIA SCREAMS) Got it. (SOFT MUSIC) (INAUDIBLE SCREAM) (SOFT MUSIC) How do I look? I just hope that he's alone, that she won't be there. Why, is he married? Yes, but she's not the issue. It's the children who would take it badly. He's the one who told you that? It's gonna take me a little while. Maybe you could have a look around Naples? Hey, tell me something. You look beautiful. (INAUDIBLE) (INAUDIBLE) (Mia) Open! (Mia, crying) Fucking open. Hey! - What happened? - Nothing. - What did she say? - Nothing. - Give me his name, I'll talk to him. - What are you doing? - I'll talk to him. - It's useless, Paolo! - It's time he takes responsibility... - He's dead! What do you mean he's dead? He's been dead for a year. A year? (Mia, crying) Look, I didn't lie to you! (Mia, crying) I really wanted him to be the father. He told me himself he wanted to marry me. Because people like you marry? Of course I would get married. But who would want someone like me? I can't do anything, I can't even sing. (MIA CRIES) Enough crying. Enough. Anyway, even someone like me, who would want me? (MIA CRIES AND LAUGHS AT THE SAME TIME) - Let's go have a walk, come on. - But where? Wow! Beautiful! - Yeah? - Yes. - It doesn't make me look fat, right? - (Paolo) No way! (Mia) Yes, it might be the one. According to you, would Mario like it? Well, it's not his type. No, it's not his type. In fact, I'm sure he will say no, as always. He's like that: an asshole. But he got me pregnant, so now I have to marry him. He always told me so. "Mario is an asshole." You said so, right? - Yes, that he was an asshole, yes. - (Mia) But also a dickhead, right? - (Mia) A huge dickhead, say it. - A dickhead, a huge dickhead. A huge dickhead, a moron too. I always told him: it's not weddings that make couples happy, dickhead. - Yes, but now that the child is coming, you need to marry. - (Mia and Paolo) Sure. Plus you're beautiful. With this dress, no man could resist you. - (Mia) Oh, come on. - Right? Right. Except Mario's a fag. How do you know? Did you fuck Mario? (laughing nervously) No...no! Stop everything, girls, 'cause this is a scoop! You have to have the courage to say it in front of them both. You have to say "I fucked Mario"! Say it! Say it. - I fucked Mario. - I didn't hear. Did you hear anything? No. So? - I fucked Mario! - Say it, loud! "I fucked Mario!" Say it! - I fucked Mario! - "I fucked Mario!" (together) I fucked Mario! - Did you fuck Mario? - I fucked Mario! Yes. Perfect. What about the dress? (UPBEAT ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (INAUDIBLE) (UPBEAT ELECTRONIC MUSIC) I scored, I'm off to fuck!

(PAOLO CHUCKLES) (Mia) How long were you together? - A while. - How much is "a while"? Eight years. (Mia) Why did it end? (Paolo) He wanted something more. A house, a family,... ...children. (Mia) Well, it's normal. No, it's not normal. You can't want everything, it's selfish. There are limits. You can't pretend there aren't. But do you want a child? Let's make the delivery today. Oh my God! It looks more like a prison than an orphanage! - Paolo? - Huh? - Are you sure? - Yeah, yeah. I'm already ruined anyway. We don't understand who could be this... this benefactor. Listen, they only said to deliver it, so... Anyway, it was really needed, right? "Like bread!" I think we've had this kitchen for over thirty years. - It has many stories to tell. - I can imagine. - Over here. - Over here. Leave it, leave it, thank you.

That's enough, now! Let me go! When will you find someone who will take care of you? (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) (Mia) You don't remember your mother at all? (Paolo) Her back, when she was leaving. But I think it's a fantasy, because I was too young. They brought me here when I had just been born. I should've been adopted, twice. I got close, but nothing came of it. Ridiculous: these people come, they tell you to call them mum and dad... ...and then, after a bit, you don't see them again. Then I turned eighteen, and I left on my own. And you didn't look for her again? No. - No? - No. Let's go south. - What's south? - Nothing. Perfect! (Mia) Paolo! Hey! Wake up! We need to stop. My daughter took control of my bladder. Pull over then. That way we can also switch places. (THE ENGINE WON'T START) (Paolo) Fucking hell... - No luck? - I think it's gonna stay here. - We can go on foot, it's not far. - Yeah?

Go help out. (Aunt) Come here, come on. - This one? - Yes. Auntie, your hair is beautiful. I want to do mine like this too. - (Mia) Why don't you do it? - Because then she's not welcome in my house. That smell! - Don't tell me you're making parmigiana? - I am, love. Yummy! I'm always hungry. For example, I crave pineapple. Your mum had that too when she was pregnant with you, right? (Nunzia) It's true. I always wanted pineapple. We couldn't buy it, so I stayed nine months without having any. Sometimes your dad had to tie my hands. Don't worry about it, my love, keep cutting. I'll give you a hand, that way we'll be faster. - Are you saying I'm useless? - We all used to be useless. Go have a look at the pot. At first. And then we ended up enjoying so many things we didn't want to do. But you, don't you want to feed this baby girl? (in Calabrian) Or are you gonna take her to the restaurant every night in the capital. Or you could hire a maid. But I don't think you two can afford a maid. You don't even have a job. (in Calabrian) At best you could be the one serving someone else. I have a job. I mean a real job, my love. A house, a plate of hot soup three times a day... ...then medicines, toys, ... ...clothes, a doctor... (in Calabrian) God only knows how much you need. (in Calabrian) And how many times you'll have to feed her instead of yourself. And don't think, my love, that I can help you, because I really can't. Exactly, as usual, I'll handle it on my own. (in Calabrian) If this is the result... When have you ever done anything for me? - How many times have I tried, Mimma? - (Mia) You? How many times have I tried to help you? Did you forget the problems you had? Or should I say, that you still have. I don't have problems. The only one who has problems here is you. Alright, if we need to talk about it... ...it seems strange to me that someone like you didn't think first... ...of finding a solution to this problem. When there was still time. But now you're pregnant, Mimma. And you have to keep it. (Paolo) Mia! (Paolo) Mia! Hey, what's going on?

How is Valerio? Good. Good. How about you? I did something insane. I wanted to act like a family man, a straight man. She's her daughter, Paolo. For the first time, I saw a future. Do you think I'm crazy? (Mario) Let's go. (Mario) Let's go. I'm taking you back home. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) (Mia) But do you want a child? It is not a matter of wanting it or not wanting it. It's nature. (Paolo) In nature, a man and a woman can make children. Yes. A man and a man? No. (Paolo) If nature wanted it, it would have let us. (Paolo) Why force it? We'd risk being against nature.

By a man who didn't even introduce himself. She had used drugs and was passed out. The placenta had detached and the doctors induced labour. The child is well. The mother immediately left and didn't want to legitimise her. (Paolo) Why did you let her leave? (Woman) It's the law. Thankfully. Do you know how many kids used to be born who knows where? Then who knows what happened to them. The woman declared that you are the natural father of the child. She gave us your number, told us you'd arrive immediately. Listen, we contacted you because it's procedure. You don't have any responsibility if you're not involved in this. Did she lie, Mr. Guerrisi? You were right to contact me. So you want to legitimise her? Of course, you can request a test... Can I see her? If you're not a parent, you have to wait for visiting hours. And you can only see her through the glass.
