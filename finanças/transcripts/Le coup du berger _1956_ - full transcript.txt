The moral of the story: A good chess player is always one move ahead of his opponent. A classic example: The move called the Scholar's mate. Only a beginner will fall for it. It's her move. - Going out? - To see Solange. Give her my regards. See you tonight. Take off your coat. Want a drink? More. Where are you going? Be right back. - Darling— - Yes, darling? Did you know that the Jivaro Indians, to honor their ladylove and show her their gratitude, have a custom of offering, on the night of the third moon... a shrunken head. Disgusting! I heartily agree. - That's why I prefer for the occasion— - What occasion? The occasion. This pelt. - What is it? - A pelt. Like it? And so, the pelt of the beast becomes the stakes of the match. Claire tries the Italian gambit. I can hardly see you. Curtains. - Thief. - You're not going to sleep in it. - How will we handle this? - Why? - For Jean. - Jean? - I can't tell him that— - Naturally. How will we handle it? Make something up. Tell him you found it. - Or won it. - Are you kidding? Then you think of something. I've got an idea, but— - You'll laugh at me. - Tell me anyway. Their plan is simple: Put the fur coat in a suitcase, go to a train station and pretend to be a traveler. Be right back. - Done. - No problems? Go to 11, rue des Dames Augustines. What will I tell him? - What? - Where I found it. Wait. The perfect crime. - Hello, Yvonne. Is he home? - Yes, madam. - Hello, darling. - Hello. I'm late. My taxi got stuck in traffic. - Can we dine early? - Yes, right away. - Claire? - Yes? I'd like to go to bed early. I need to go to the office tomorrow morning. Yvonne, call us when it's ready. I'm exhausted. - What would you do if— - If what, honey? I'd get some rest. - Look. - What is it? A baggage claim ticket. - It was on the floor of the taxi. - Why'd you pick it up? - You should've left it. - What do I do now? - Throw it out. - We can't just— You should've left it with the cabbie. - I didn't think of that. - Too bad. Throw it out. It might be something valuable. How should I know? Put it in the jar. You're wrong. Think so? - About what? - The baggage claim ticket. What do you want me to do? Check it out. We don't know what it is. If it has their address, we could return it. But... if it were important, they wouldn't have lost it like that. They'd have been careful. It's not much to ask. If it were precious, they'd go to the baggage claim. The employee would recognize them. - How could he? - He would. Or they'd describe their bag. Did you order the stuff? Stuff? The things for tomorrow night. You are intending to feed our guests? Certainly. It's tomorrow night, isn't it? I called Chichette... to confirm it was tomorrow. Yes, it's tomorrow. So you won't do anything? I'll play some piano for them. Not that, the baggage claim ticket. What baggage claim ticket? - That's all? - It's Monday. Monday, day of the moon. I'll go tomorrow morning. It's becoming a habit. Are you listening? I'll go to the baggage claim tomorrow. Well... that worked out nicely. You're terrific. What's wrong? You really want me to go? Then I'll go, honey. - You'll go? - Tomorrow morning. Promise. Happy now? The next morning, the match continues. Claire advances her bishop. You're sweet. Sweet? A sucker. Bye-bye, my tiny tot. Claude? It worked. Not really. - Yes? - Your sister's here. - Sorry about her. - I am your sister. Hello. Hello, I can't stay. I just came to return this. - Have fun? - Don't remind me. Boring as hell. - Your party's tonight, right? - I hope it'll be less boring. Don't be silly. Do you mind? Go right ahead. - What are you pouting about? - Nothing. How's your love life? Which one? - You've got more than one? - Sure. I see! Time for you to marry. It's nothing like that! I'm doing just fine. Hey, that's pretty. - Is it new? - It's just my gray jacket. - I never saw it before. - It's over a year old. Like it? - A lot. - Try it on. - Does it fit? - I think so. Then it's yours. I never wear it. I wouldn't want to rob you. What are you talking about? You're the one who's strange. Strange? You've been acting strange lately. Really? How? I don't know. Just strange. It's nothing. You're imagining things. Probably. Did you decide? Well? Is that the time? I've got to run. Thanks! - Claire, you're a sweetheart. - Solange, you're an angel. A fallen angel, but an angel all the same. - See you tonight. - See you then. Now the wind turns, the chessboard tips: The first attempt at checkmate. - You're home. - In person. - You're late. - I got held up. In here. Don't let the maid see. Hold on. Hurry, open it! - Careful, what if it explodes? - Stop fooling around. Patience, little one. What is it? Rabbit fur. Not bad. Honey, don't pout. It's no big deal. - I told you that the owners— - You got the wrong bag. It could be worse. It might come in handy. What will we do with it? Why not give it to Yvonne? Or throw it out. Come on, let's have lunch. I'm starving. - What's wrong? - Just a minute. Making a phone call? Well, come in! - Don't touch me. - What's wrong? Didn't it work? - You're asking me? - Of course I am. - No. - No what? No, it didn't work. Why not? Take off your coat. What happened? - Tell me! - There's nothing to tell. - Did he guess the truth? - It's not that. - He didn't get the suitcase? - Yes, he did. Explain! I don't understand. It's simple: He got the suitcase, but it was empty. - What? - It might as well have been. Unbelievable. Is that all you can say? What do you want me to say? Are you sure your husband— Leave Jean out of it. Then what do you want me to— I don't understand it. It's inexplicable. Want a drink? "No." You don't want a drink. Don't just stand there. Do something. What can we do? I don't know. There must be some way— We have no proof. Nothing. - Nothing can be done. - Do something. What do you expect me to do? You're spineless, a lump of jelly. - Thanks. - It's true. Not to twist the knife, but it was your idea. - So what? - So... nothing. So you admit you set up the whole thing. You're saying it's my fault? - Almost. - How sweet. Please, don't start. You're the one— - What are you doing? - I'd better leave. You just got here. Stay a while. I'm in no mood for your whims today. - Such sweetness. - See? All you do is annoy me. Fine. I won't insist. Good idea. Good-bye. - Will I see you tonight? - No. What do you mean? - It's better if you don't come. - Why? It's just better. You're incredible! That's how it is. - When will I see you? - Not tonight. Will you come over Thursday? I don't know. - Then when? - I don't know. I'll call you. Promise? Wait and see. - Nothing else to say? - Well— Fine. Adieu. I mean, good-bye. - Tired? - I'll be okay. Here's the final move. Claire realizes she's been played. Too late. - Jean Delanoix or Jules? - Jules. Want a drink?
