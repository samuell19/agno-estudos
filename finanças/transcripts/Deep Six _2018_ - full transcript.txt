(tense music) - Base do you copy? Base, mayday! I have no power! I'm cycling, the breaker is gone. Damn you! Oh my God. Oh! (breathing heavily) Eject, eject! (tense music) (coughing) (gasping) (grunting) (tense music) (coughing) (breathing heavily) Brains! (tense music) We were the first astronauts into deep space. A crew of military and scientists sent to explore microbial life on a distant ice planet. We came using the Terminal, a transportation system that reduced a 10,000 year journey to just months. It was incredible. And dangerous, because it was our only connection to Earth. - [Siege] Did you see that? - Siege, say again, I didn't copy you. - [Siege] I have radar contact. Your frame: fourteen down, five-oh. - Charlie, do you see what she's on about? - [Charlie] Sorry dude, nothing on radar. - Dammit Siege. Well I'll be damned. - [Charlie] I'm still not getting any readings here. - Siege, tally your visual on your bogey. - Copy. - Maybe a comet fragment scattering the radar? Charlie, update on the capsule? - [Charlie] Capsule's arriving in 12 seconds. - Looks like the bogey will stay out of the arrival zone. - [Siege] Duke, we have to leave. - Say again. - We have to get out of here. - What are you talking about? (grunting) (booming) (crackling) What the hell was that? Charlie, what happened? Charlie? Siege, do you copy? Base, do you copy? - [Senna] Siege is not responsive, but her ship is outside the debris zone. We have a visual on Duke. Athea and I are on route to his position. - Athea, return to base now. - John, the capsule exploded. If Duke lost power, that means he can't outrun the debris. I can flip him around and use his engines as a shield. - Leave him, you don't have the fuel. - Then come and get me when I'm done. Senna, cut base comm. - [Senna] Roger. - Did she just cut us off? - ETA on that debris. - [Senna] Ninety seconds. - We have to save time by coming in fast and stopping hard. Authorize remove safety. - [Senna] Authorized. - Replot with ninety D-cell new arrival. - [Senna] 40 seconds. But it's gonna hurt, Athea. - Execute. - [Senna] OMS burn for pitch-down maneuver in three, two, one. (grunts) (tense music) Pitch over complete. Main deceleration burn, in three, two, one. (grunting) Rendezvous is imminent. Brace for impact. - Okay, Senna, I have control. - [Senna] Copy. (tense music) - Careful. Come on. (grunts) Are we okay? - [Senna] I think so. I'm trying to contact Duke's ship. There's no power. Backup systems have failed. - Oh my God. Put your helmet on. - [Duke] I was attacked. - [Athea] What? - [Duke] I was... - Oh my God. Duke. (he groans) - Duke! - [Duke] Shit. (tense music) - No! (gasping) Oh God. (tense music) - [Man On PA] All medical personnel to muster station Alpha. Now receiving out of hangar bays one and two. - Siege! Hey, you okay? Hey, hey. Wow, you are not okay. You barfed all over the hangar. - Sorry. - It's okay, it's okay. Just, okay here, come with me, come on. Up we go, yep. There you go. - [Man On PA] All personnel to muster station Alpha. Now receiving out of hangar bays one and two. - Down you go. Hey, hey, what happened to you? - I'm fine, where's Duke? - [Man On PA] All clear. - Athea? - She's okay. She's insane, actually. She took her ship into the debris field. She flipped Duke's ship dicks over dongers and she used his engine as a shield. It actually coulda worked, but-- - Someone should go check on her. - Okay, alright. Stay here, okay? (tense music) (knocking) - Athea. - Gimme a fucking second. With all due respect sir, I can't sign that. - It's just a reprimand. - I had to try and save him. - You didn't. Athea. Duke's death was an accident. Yours would have been a mistake. - An accident? - That's right. - I was out there and I have no idea what that was. We've been here 11 months. No issues receiving capsules and suddenly, all hell breaks loose? And Duke, he tried to signal me something. - I read your report. Eddie is on it. It is no longer your concern. - We have to ground the fleet until we know what happened. - I am not grounding the fleet. - We just lost our Wing Commander. - We should have left five months ago. Because Eddie extended our mission here, we have run out of food and if the transport terminal is damaged, we can't receive the next capsule or go home. It is our lifeline and everybody flies until it gets repaired-- - Sir, we have to-- - Unless you wanna die here. So, I need to know, can you take an order whether you like it or not? - By the way, if the Terminal really is screwed, you might wanna ration that. - Athea. - Yes, sir. - I was in the Round Room having a toast with the pilots. We watched the explosion from there. They're waiting on word of their new Wing Commander. (tense music) Congratulations. - [Base] Nemain, we read you on good approach to the Terminal. Hold at waypoint one while we do a final check on Tau Ceti for any stellar activity. - [Bobbi] Hey, quick question. Did you take your boots off, 'cause it kinda smells like death in here. - My feet get hot. - [Bobbi] Yeah. - Please don't be blown to shit. - Hey, don't worry about it. We're the dream team. Nothing you can't fly, nothing I can't fix. - [Base] Checking weather reports now. Nemain you're a go for survey pass and Bobbi, you're a go for EVA, good luck. - Copy that. (tense music) - Turn on the port light. (tense music) - Base, we're coming under the blast shield now. Missing two fuel cells and there's major damage to the Terminal's attitude and thrust control module. - [Base] Copy that. There's a lot of interference on the video feed. For now, carry on with a verbal description of what you see. - That's the thing, Base, there's not much to see. - [Nemain] You can fix anything, right Bobbi? - [Bobbi] I can't fix this. - There goes our ticket home. (tense music) - Oh, Jesus. Siege, what are you doing here? - I heard what you did for Duke. - It was nothing. - [Siege] Athea? - [Athea] Yeah? - Did you see anything? - No, but you said you felt something. I read the transcript. You could have bought Duke some valuable time if you'd been a little more clear headed. It's not you being the youngest or the least experienced that concerns me. It's when you don't acknowledge that you need a break that you put others at risk. Do you understand? - I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry, just... Get some sleep. Oh. (groans) I told you to put your fucking helmet on! (tense music) (chattering) - I need to get another drink. - Wait, we forgot to toast Duke's plane. - Oh, lemme do it. - [Bobbi] Having a good day? - Hello kids. Probably not a good sign if you're reading this. I'm not, ah, good with words, but... I believe in the challenge to explore and make the unknown known. It's why we're here. Don't be embarrassed to cry over me. I was a big deal. And we all know space is hard. - [All] Space is hard. Space is hard, space is hard. - The gravitational waveprint seems nominal. There's nothing there to suggest a problem. - [Delphi] I agree. We must widen our search for the cause of the explosion. Perhaps I can start with the AI from Duke's ship. - We'll have it tomorrow morning. - [Delphi] Furthermore, Julianne should conduct an autopsy on Duke looking for any trace debris from the capsule that may have lodged itself in his skull. - Excellent idea. Thank you, Delphi. - [Delphi] My pleasure, Eddie. I'll have new ideas for you in the morning. We'll reconvene then. - Goodnight, Delphi. - [Delphi] Eddie, may I ask you a question on a more sensitive topic? - Yes. - [Delphi] My analysis has raised concerns about matters classified above my level of access. - About the Terminal? - [Delphi] Yes. And it's possible connection to your work on Siku. (hatch closes) (sighs) (knocking) - J-just a minute. (sighs) This better be life or death. - It's death. Siku's deep habitat should be blooming, but in the 20 years we've been able to study it, there's been a decline in diversity. - Yes, I'm aware of the decline. - Yes, but any downward trend on such a small time scale could only be described as mass extinction. Why? - With all due respect, Eddie, I have a big day tomorrow trying to avoid our own mass extinction, so if these bugs are still living, maybe you could put it in a memo. - [Eddie] I discovered the cause behind extinction of life on Siku. - [John] I swear to God, Eddie. You've got five minutes. Keep it short. - Do you remember when we met? You were giving a speech to fast-track development of the Terminal to top priority. - And it worked. - Of course it worked. Your brother ran the committee. Earth. Siku. The Terminal. Every time a capsule arrives at the terminal there is an instant ejection of mass and energy into our space. This creates waves in our space-time, like a rock being thrown at a pond. They pass through the moon, the planets-- - The capsules are too small to cause any large scale effects. - The one that brought the machines to build the terminal, that was enormous. It wasn't just a splash, it was a tsunami... a tidal wave that swept through the entire system. It would have had effects on the planet. Something underneath the ice that we couldn't see, but enough to change ocean temperatures, enough to cause the ongoing extinction. - You came up with this? - Delphi and myself. Oh, fuck. - I'm having a bad day, Eddie. - I'm sorry. - This goes no further than you and I until we get home. - No. This is my call to make. (screaming) - Ah, God. - Are you okay? - Did I wake you? - Yeah, yeah. I mean I think you woke everyone on Earth, too. Hey, you okay? Sounded like you were being bloody murdered in your bed. - [Man On PA] Captain Hershel, please report to operations. - Hey, Ant. Brought you some coffee. - Oh thanks, just watch your step there, yeah. - Oh, sorry. - That's okay. - So, these are pieces of the capsule. - Pulled from Duke and Athea's ships. Hopefully we can, ah, give Eddie a bit of a head start in figuring out what happened. - Anything I can do to help? - You know what? I think we're good, actually. But thanks. - Sure. Ant? I just need something to keep busy. - Okay, sure. Ah, here, put these gloves on and you can start pulling the AI out of ADM. What'd I just step on? (hissing) (tense music) - [Paris] Yo, on your left. - Hey, Carl. Morning, morning. - Oh, Nemain, you're all sweaty. - It's not sweat. I'm leaking your bloody moonshine out of my beautiful pores. - Gross. - I think I overdid it last night. I should quit drinking. - [Carl] Well, shouldn't be too hard. We'll be out of liquor by the end of the week. - [Nemain] You're shitting me. - [Carl] I shit you not. - So, what's the supply situation? I mean, did we lose everything from the capsule? - Classified. - It's that bad? - You don't have to start drinking your own piss yet, but... - Save a jar? - Oh. No, Ant is busy combing through the wreckage, trying to find pieces of the capsule and, well, I'm taking Duke's AI to Eddie so she can figure out what the hell happened. - She will. - Yeah. So, what's our chocolate situation? - Oh my God, it is depressing. - Carl. - But, I did manage to... save some dark for ya. - Oh... - As long as you still have wheat to trade. You're an angel. - I know. - Whoop. - Oop. - Morning, Nemain, Carl. - Sam, Paris. My God, he's fast. (thudding) (grunting) - Jesus, Hamrond. Looks like the bag's winning. Why don't you take a break, huh? - He's got it. - No worries. - Thanks, Hamrond. - I don't even know why they make these nerds do PT. - We're all nerds here, remember? - Hey look, I wanted to talk to you about Duke. - Later. - Look, just keep punching. I'll talk. You're Commander now, so... Squad Leader's open. - You're unbelievable. - Hear me out, just hear me out, okay? Look, you can switch us from patrols to babysitting repairs until next week. I know Nemain's next in line on paper and she's a hell of a pilot. I can handle EVAs. It only makes sense. Listen, wait, wait, wait. Look, this could be good, for us. (thudding) - Any repeated distressing memories or dreams? - Nope. - You're having migraines in flight. Antony mentioned you were sick in the hangar bay. PTSD can be aggravated by your SPS. - You're gonna run out of letters to describe me. - Well, you just can't ignore it. You have to know when to take a break-- - No, please don't. - I'm sorry. No flights for two weeks. - Athea ordered this. - Actually, this one came straight from the top. Siege. - John... please don't ground me. I'm not crazy. There's something out there-- - Well, good morning, Siege. How is my favorite niece? - Everyone else is on double duty except for me. - Well. I read the report. You were having trouble out there, you were confused. - I can't explain it. That doesn't mean it wasn't real. - Siege... I know that you're sensitive, like your dad. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. - I'm not my father. - Well, for your own safety and for the safety of this Terminal, you need to take it easy. - For your safety, John, keep me out there. - Anyone who comes waltzing in here, other than Eddie and tells me what to do, they float home! The family card does not trump orders from the Commander. - Yes, sir. - Dismissed. - Look, I'm sorry about earlier. You seemed okay about everything. Just it's just hard to read you sometimes. - You know what? Then don't read me, okay? Just don't be a dick. - Okay. - Look, it's not about you. I don't feel like talking, okay? - [Paris] I just wanna make sure that everything-- - Paris, I said I don't feel like talking. Ow, careful. (tense music) (rhymic pinging) (pinging fades) - [Bobbi] Yeah, that's the way it goes. Gives us a hell of a stiff in the morning. - [Hamrond] Yeah, well that's military style for ya. - Just saying, Duke would want us drunk as hell, lighting shit on fire right now, you know? - The night is still young. (all chuckling) - What? - That's not home brew. How the hell'd you get that? - Carl and his little black market. - Ah, where is Carl, by the way? - Yeah, we're gonna drink all his booze without him. - The last capsule was a data capsule, just reports and personal letters. The only science payload of note was an experimental cell culture to start a soil crop. And I have Ant trying to recreate some of the data, but so far, no luck. And that's the end of the good news. The bad news is the last capsule was the size of golf ball. The incoming capsule... - She has clearance. Stays in this room. - Yes, sir. - [John] Carry on. - Well, the incoming capsule is a cargo capsule filled with essential food and fuel supplies and it is the size of a three-story house, which means a larger work bubble, which means more energy and if we can't catch it, that could be a catastrophic explosion. - Will we lose the Terminal? - The Terminal, the moon, the planet. - And of course, us. (tense music) - Well, I'm definitely ready to get outta here, so how long 'til you fix it? - It's more of a replace than fix situation and it's not my department. - It's not my job, either. - If we print those parts, it is. - You know we don't have the materials for that. - Well why don't we just send an SOS home? Help, we're fucked, send parts. - 'Cause there's already a capsule on the way. - Yeah, so? - Didn't you read any of the briefings? - He's more of a picture book type guy. - Okay, I studied phytology, not whatever this is. - You can't launch two at the same time. Warp drive is a one-way tunnel. - Physics. - Where do we stand on repairs? - We have, um, 73 systems in functional order. The S three-over-four truss, the S four the S five-- - [John] Eddie. - [Eddie] The S-- - Let's just stick to the dysfunctional systems, please. - Yes, um, page 68. The primary physical damage was to precision stabilization. Without these systems, I calculate a four percent probability of catching the next incoming capsule. - Four percent? - Mm hmm. Rounding up. - And this is when you tell me about your brilliant plan. - Well, we can't manufacture the parts, so, I propose we steal them. - Steal them? - [Eddie] Correct. - From whom? - From you. We use the stabilization system on the military satellite in orbit around Airmid. Taking into count limiting variables such as food, fuel, cargo, a round trip would take a minimum of thirty days. - Next capsule arrives in 25 days. - It's a problem. - [Carl] It's a big problem. - Well, shit. Well, I am assuming that none of us get any sleep until we figure this out. Unless you wanna die here. - I'll make coffee. (tense music) - [Bobbi] Suit circuit is about four point three. I've got an ascent pressure light, and a pre-amp light. - [Heddy] The small ship docking bay is up and running. First signs of life in the Terminal. - [Bobbi] (sighs) It's moving along. - [Heddy] We've hit our exposure limits for the day. Let's head back to base. I'm depressurizing the cabin. (screaming) - God! God, you're so fuckin' loud. Ah, Jesus. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, hey. Hey, you okay? God, you are like the most vivid and loud dreamer, you know Siege. - God, I hate my brain. - No wonder you get spacegraines all the time. - Does everyone know that? So you all think I'm the weakest link. I'm only here because of John? - No. They're all fuckin' stupid and you're amazing. And don't give a fuck what they think about you. - So, I should be a sociopath? - Yeah. And break that nasty little habit. - Of? - Not trusting yourself. I gotta go. - Hey, where you going? - I gotta be in the sim in like, two hours, so... I'll see ya later. - What if we remove the seats? Each one of them must weigh about 200 kilos. - Strap the pilots to the walls for decel? - Really? That won't work. - Nothing is off the table here, alright? Bring up the schematics. Look at it. Ellen, six-dash-K. - Delphi. - [Delphi] Right away. - [Ant] Flip it. - I need a coffee. - Well, we're out. - I'll make some. - No, we are out out. Just crush some caffeine pills into hot water. - It won't work. - Tastes like shit, but it'll work. - No, the chair houses the water refiltering system. It's like 90 percent of the weight. - [Payette] We gotta keep 'em then. - Can we do it with just one? - Speaking of water filtration, I gotta hit the head. We been at this all night. Can we take ten? - Five. - I'll run the numbers on losing one seat. - Gonna have to stop by the med bay. I'll be right back. - Just one of them. - Hey, Ant. Up high. - I'm trying, you know. - Ant. You've been chaining back to back all nighters to keep us safe. I mean, you've been doing everything you can. Not your fault. - Space is hard. - Space is a bitch. (tense music) (knocking) - [Carl] John. - What time is it? - We have it. - Where's Eddie? - [Ant] She's over there. - Wake her up. I wanna kick her ass. - [Carl] What's wrong? - I don't see what you all see. - It's all there, sir. - I can read, Antony. It reads like a suicide mission. - Delphi backed up all of Eddie's math. If we leave in the next 15 hours, we can make it. - Has Athea seen this? - Not yet. - So, just, ah... talk me through this, idiot style. Let's ah... start with the EVA, Antony. This checklist. In order to get the damn parts off the satellite requires two people. - There's a new checklist, sir. It's tough and it requires multiple trips, but I managed to get it down to one pilot. - One pilot? Well, I don't see that here. Um... - Ah, Nemain's in the sim, verifying it. - Ah, and we have two weeks to fine-tune it while we travel. - Now, what's this... about fasting? - Well, we're tight on space and heavy on fuel. We can fit 1,000 calories per day en route so our pilot can function during the EVAs, but we need to cut it down to a fraction of that on the way back to save weight. - And we will be increasing the sleeper meds for the return trip. He'll be knocked out for most of it. - Has Julianne signed off on these numbers? - Not yet, but she's up in an hour. - But look, high G-force exposure. The vehicle will experience extreme deceleration at the destination point during a low orbit aerial breaking maneuver. Approximately ten Gs for ten minutes. Potential damage to scientific and organic payloads remains an ongoing and significant concern. So before I go on, let me ask: do we have another plan in the works? - Um... (clears throat) Well, Delphi had another, which I hesitate to bring up. - Don't hesitate, bring it up. - Okay, Delphi mentioned that a human was required to retrieve the parts, but not for the return trip. - Jesus, Carl. - Ah, look, I wasn't suggesting that we actually do that, John. - If we send someone, they come back. - If we send someone? Respectfully, sir, this is the only way to save the base and us. - Fine. So wake up Julianne, get her to sign off on this guaranteed weight loss program and for God's sakes, let's take out the phrasing organic payload and just say human. Speaking of, let's loop in Athea, see if we can find a pilot that is up for all of this. He is going to be alone for a month. He can't move, he can't eat and he won't sleep and he has to slam on the brakes for a good 10 minutes before pulling off an EVA that is designed for two people. - Who said it's a he? (thudding) (grunting) - [Athea] I didn't know you worked out this early. - Me, neither. - You get any sleep last night? - No, well, a little. I was in the simulator running tests for the task force for hours. It's okay, I don't need much sleep. - Well, that's good. You're gonna love this. (tense music) (clears throat) On to business. Next up is the matter of my old position. Congratulations to Lieutenant Paris Leverton who will be taking over as lead pilot. (clapping) And what you've probably all been wondering about, taking on Eddie's deep space mission to the satellite orbiting Airmid to save all our asses will be Lieutenant Nemain Briggs. (clapping) Okay, as usual, survey and repair rotations are posted. Watch your rations and be careful out there. Dismissed. (tense music) - [Carl] What are you talking about? You love crab. - That is not-- - This is crab. - That is dehydrated I don't know what the fuck-- - This is rehydrated. Mia, okay, you know what? No, no, no... there's more, there's more. Keep your panties on. - I'm not wearing any. - Gross. - La piece de resistance: made from the last of our chocolate. - That looks so good. I'm not gonna eat that much before my flight, but-- - Yeah, maybe you should just save it. - Just a bit. What? - When I signed off on Eddie's mission, I didn't think it would be you out there on your own. - (sighs) I know. I mean, I am the hotshot pilot around here, so... - (chuckles) You're gonna get your hotshot ass back here. - I will. Now, eat your brownie. - Yeah, namaste. - Shalom. No sugar? - Yeah, we ran out of sugar. - It's still good. - [Carl] Oh, God. That's worse, that is worse. - Yo. I've got 30 seconds. Can you believe this is all I'm allowed for personal items? I can't fit my vibrator in here. - I have something for you. Deep socks. Bobbi would have wanted you to have them. Everyone signed them. - For my stinky feet. It's kinda hilarious. Paris gets promoted and I get a suicide mission. - Guess you're sleeping with the wrong pilot. - Damn. I don't think I'm gonna be able to do this. It's impossible. - Hey. Athea chose you because you're the only one who can. - Okay, I gotta go. I'll see ya. (tense music) - [Base] You're a go for main engine burn. - Copy that. - [Base] Good luck Nemain and Godspeed. - [Eddie] Is she off? - [Paris] Just in time. - You did it, Eddie. - [Athea] Thank you, Eddie. - Thank you, Eddie. - Thank you, Eddie. (tense music) - [Brains] Gravity assist complete, you can unbuckle. - Okay, Brains. Here we go. (tense music) (beeping) Brains? That was another proximity alert. Why, why are you ignoring it? - [Brains] The object was not on an intercept course. I didn't think there was any danger. Nemain, we need to talk about your last blood sample. Your cortisol levels are off the scales. - Not surprising. - [Brains] Your noradrenaline, too. You're losing a battle with depression, here. - I'm-I'm just tired. I mean, I can't sleep. I can't eat enough. I'm starving. Can't exercise and ah... And I reek. What do you want me to do about it? - [Brains] If the weather cooperates, maybe we can call home again. Give you time to flirt with Siege. Whatever, I'm not jealous. - No, no. I'm not in the mood. - [Brains] Fine, you're down. You don't wanna talk. Actually, I'm pumped. I mean, I think they chose the right AI for the job, and a pretty decent pilot. - No, it was, it should have been Bobbi. - Bullshit. You're a hell of a pilot. You just gotta keep sailing, kiddo. - Hey, what's that song? ♪ The water is ♪ ♪ Wide ♪ ♪ I can't cross o'er ♪ ♪ I can't remember the words ♪ ♪ And neither have ♪ ♪ My wings to fly ♪ ♪ Give me a boat ♪ ♪ that can carry two ♪ ♪ And both shall row ♪ ♪ My love and I ♪ (tense music) - [Brains] Entering Airmid's atmosphere. Commencing aero-capture. Orbital G decreasing within parameters. How you doin', Nemain? - I'm okay. (tense music) - How's she doing? - She's on her third EVA. - What, the circuit board retrieval? That one's not so bad. - May as well get comfortable. Four hours left. - We have audio. You wanna say hello? - Ah, Nemain, how the hell are ya? - Ant, hey. Oh God, they let you in ops? - Yeah, yeah, I had to fight my way in. Eddie's got a hell of a right hook. How you doin'? - Um, I'm unlocking the fine guidance sensor. Is the doc there? - Ah, yeah, yeah, she's here. - [Nemain] Okay, I'm having a lot of numbness in my hand. Ah, I'm having a hard time steadying the sensor. - She has a herniated disc from deceleration. - There anything we can do? - Not really. Just try to manage her stress levels. - [Ant] Doc says you've got less than one minute left to live. - (chuckling) Okay well, that sounds about right, Ant. - Ah, just keep it up. Slow and steady. EVAs are designed to get easier as you go along, so you're already over the hump. - Is that true? - I have no idea. - Okay, thanks Ant. Nice to hear your voice. - [Brains] Nemain, I'm detecting another incoming object on an intercept course. Estimated arrival in five minutes. Return to ship immediately. - God! Um, look, I'm behind. Can I just have a few more minutes to get the sensor? - [Brains] Sorry, immediately. - Aghh! - [Ant] Don't worry about it, Nemain, We can always come back. - Yeah, yeah, okay. Heading back now. (tense music) Okay, where's that little fucker? - [Brains] Your reference, six hours, down 30 degrees. - Tally the object? It appears to be a small sphere rotating, reflective. - No. Nemain, you need to get out of there now. - What's wrong? - That's what Duke saw. - [Nemain] Holy shit! It's changed course, it's headed straight toward me. - Brains. Prepare to arm ballistics and open bay doors on my mark. - [Brains] I have no ballistics on board. - Too much weight. - Fuck. - [Nemain] Jesus Christ. - Nemain, how close are you to the ship? - [Nemain] Ah, I'm approaching the hatch, okay? I'm-- - Nemain, do you read me? Nemain, comm check. (tense music) Nemain, comm check. Fucking hell. Nemain, this is Athea. Do you read me? (tense music) - Lock the doors. (tense music) - Where's Nemain? - Base, mayday. I'm cycling breakers, God damn you! (beeping) Eject, eject! (tense music) (coughing) (groaning) Brains! (sobbing) (tense music) What's that? Oh, yes. Okay. (groaning) Oh, God. Oh fuck. Shit. I should have saved that. (tense music) Okay. You're my shelter. That's good. (grunting) (tense music) (whooshing) (tense music) Oh my God. Where are you going? Wait! (tense music) Brains, Brains. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. - [Delphi] I'm sorry, Eddie. We can move the Terminal to a safe orbit and allow the capsule to pass, but we cannot ignore Carl's conclusions. Most of the crew will starve before we attempt the next scheduled catch. We must declare a state of emergency. Shall I inform the commander? - Yes. - It's done. The transfer of Deep Six to military jurisdiction. According to UN Article Five. Justification cited as an attack on ESO territory and a threat to its citizens. For the record, your objections are noted on the last page. All it requires is your signature. - You have no right to take over. - You don't have to like it. Besides, it doesn't change anything. - Changes absolutely everything. - You and Carl will have access to this office. You'll still be a head of the science team until we're ready to leave. Delphi and the engineers will be solely on repair. - What? You're completely unqualified to operate Delphi. It's not safe. - Without Delphi, we can't run the Terminal, we can't go home. - I don't want to go home. I want to make contact. - We are not ready to make contact. - Whether you're ready or not, it's happening. We're on the verge of a breakthrough and you don't know how to handle it. You're not the leader your brother was. You don't consider all the variables and your inattention to detail is infinitely frustrating and in this case, ultimately dangerous. Have you even read the U.N. articles upon which you're relying to take over? - I know them. - Well, then you're willfully ignoring the section that requires you to consult with the Security Council and I question your definition of an attack. - How 'bout two dead pilots for a start? Duke, Nemain MIA. That is too high a price to pay. So, I am going to get us home. - As you know, we lost contact with Nemain at approximately 22:00 last night. She had visual contact with a bogey in orbit around Airmid and her ship was lost moments after. This morning at 08:00 jurisdiction of Deep Six was transferred over to military control. I've posted patrols on the board, but I'm sure you have questions, so I want to see hands. Paris. - Do we know what the bogey looks like, or it just some kind of ship? - We're working strictly from Nemain's verbal description at this time. There are similarities between her sighting and Duke's sighting but we're not jumping to any conclusions at this time. Sam. - You said an engagement. Was there an exchange of fire? - Nemain's ship was unarmed. Siege. - Will there be a rescue mission? - No. (tense music) (groaning) (gasping) (breathing heavily) - Water filter. Thank you Carl. I can drink my own piss. (tense music) (beeping) - Siege, I'm coming up on waypoint 11, do you copy? - Bay doors read open, ready for drop. On A, on B. Launch. - Siege, switch to channel two. (beep) - Comm check. - [Siege] Good comm. - Siege, look, I'm sorry about Nemain. I really am. I'm all for no man left behind, but John has taken all rescue attempts off the table. - That's because he thinks she's dead. - Chrissake, look I hate to be the one to have to say it, but you need to get your head straight, Siege. Your lack of focus has already cost us. - Paris, get off this channel. - I'm just saying. Look, we lost a lot of good pilots and everyone that we've got left needs to stay clear so we can get the hell out of here. Nemain's gone. - You don't know that. Duke and I lost power. If the same happened to Nemain, then she's still alive. She had enough food and supplies for the rest of the trip, for three weeks. - She'd freeze to death. - No, her cabin temp would hold. The cockpit would insulate her and her body heat could keep her warm enough. - What about Co2? - She could jeri-rig something. The scrubbers in her suit. If-if John won't green light a manned mission, we could still send food and water and supplies and they could be there in a couple days. We know exactly where she is. - [Paris] You're stretching. - It's called trying, you dickhead. Athea, let me try. You did it for Duke. - I hear you, Siege. It's just not my call. Eddie, do you have a minute? - No. - Listen, I need your help. But to be honest, I need your help with something that John can't know about. (tense music) In the strictest definition of the word, it would be treason. (tense music) (tense music) (tense music) (tense music) - Uncle John? I'm usually the only one up this late. - Yeah, I usually don't prowl about at night like you. You know, you're just like your dad. Absolute night owl. Even as a kid. Our parents, they would try everything and finally they would just give up. He put them to bed. Go watch TV. He was something. - Yeah. - I'd be out like a brick. Never heard him come in, climb into the top bunk. See, he had the top bunk 'cause I was afraid of heights. - You were afraid of heights? - [John] Deathly. - But you were a test pilot. - Had to do it to get into the program, but I won't lie to you. I was kind of a shitty test pilot. You know, you ah... you spend your whole life pushing for something... and you get it. You ah... We step outside the system. I mean, we made it. We're a damn miracle. All I could think about while I was here was I wanted to go home. You know, see Helen and the kids. - We weren't ready for this. - I wasn't. I don't know what to do. How'd you know? How'd you know that Duke was attacked? You were the first to know. - I'm not sure Duke was attacked. - No, you were right, Siege. Nemain was attacked, too, so how did you know? - Do you ever wonder what we might look like from the outside? Invasive, aggressive even. What if Duke wasn't the target? - What was the target? The Terminal? - And maybe we're not being attacked. We're being disarmed. And Nemain is still alive. You should send me to get her. - [Carl] John. Eddie needs you in ops right away. She says it's life or death. - Alright. What is it? - Airmid. Seismic activity reports. - Oh for God's sakes, Eddie. - And this is life or death? - It's both. Athea asked me to take a second look for Nemain's ship. - [John] I didn't authorize that. - Our terminal's telescope cannot see a ship that far away, but I had another idea. 20 years ago, we used seismographs on Airmid to create debris maps in our system. These planetary images are still from 20 years ago, however, surface sensors are still sending us data. We recorded an impact here, just after Nemain's attack. Activity consistent with a crash of a ship. - Nemain's ship. I'm sorry. - Thank you for your thoroughness, Eddie. And I'm sure that Carl could use a moment. I'd like to speak to the both of you in my office. - There's more. - There always is. - There was a launch. (tense music) Minutes before the attack, we recorded an impact here. The system was designed to measure impacts, but a surface launch would have the same readings. - You mean the attack could have come from Airmid? - I've scheduled a briefing this afternoon to loop in all departments. - Now, wait a minute. There's protocol here for chrissake. None of this shit should leave the room. - Your objection is noted, John, but it's already done. You see, I've run the data for the last 24 hours. We recorded over 100 launches. It appears they're on their way. - What the hell is this? - It's contact.
