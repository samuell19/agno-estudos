What is this sound? Where the hell am I? Who calls me? Who am I? "Neo Life Form"? "Protect Hiroshi"? Hiroshi... Mochizuki Hiroshi? Professor! Professor Mochizuki! Hiroshi did you get a red mark? Then I'm better. Won‘t tell! Why? Tell us! Later! Bye Bye! You like this song too? Huh? What? What's going on? Hurry, go! Hurry, go! Hurry, go! Look! I created this... My remodeled human #1 I used a human body for it. Although it's much weaker than you, though. Now! Monster! Monster! Monster! Let's go! Good good, alright! Piece of crap! Grandpa! Hiroshi. My two»legged baby walker is still a failure. Grandpa! Grandpa! What's wrong Hiroshi? What‘s wrong? What is it? Well... There there there... It‘s true Grandpa! Believe me! Alright, alright. But don‘t you think it's weird? Why would a monster want to attack you, Hiroshi? How do I know?! But it's true! Then, another monster appeared? Riding a bike... He was green color... He looked like a grasshopper. Then, it saved you? Looks like it. Ah, that‘s right. Hiroshi, do you want to have a meal with your grandpa sometime? Eh? Grandpa is always so busy, I don't get time to play with you. Plus your dad is missing and all... What?! Grandpa no fair! You don't believe my story! Hiroshi! A monster really appeared! Plus Papa's coming back! He'll definitely return! Whatever! Hiroshi! Hiroshi! Grasshopper? Hiroshi said grasshopper didn‘t he? Wait! Papa... I'm... scared Here it is! Hiroshi—kun... Hiroshi—kun... Hiroshi-kun! Hiroshi—kun wait please! Hiroshi—kun wait please! Hiroshi—kun, what's wrong, you're shaking? Your lesson is tommorrow. Aweird guy... Aweird guy... is following me! Is that you? Why are you following Hiroshi? Say something! Hiroshi—kun is being targeted by monsters. That‘s why I have to protect him. Monsters? It's true, a monster attacked me, That's why I want Sis and the others to help me. Also, notjust one, there are two of them! You‘re wrong. One is protecting you. For now, stop following Hiroshi. Wh—wh—what is that?! Hurry and flee with Hiroshi—kun! Go! Hiroshi—kun are you okay? Alright? Huh? Sis! Say something! Hiroshi—kun, hurry! Hiroshi—kun, hang on! Hiroshi-kun! Hiroshi—kun, hang on! Hiroshi! How's Hiroshi? Seems alright. Alright, I hope he gets better. Two years ago, when my son went missing. This was all that was left in my son‘s lab. I don't completely understand it. What was my son doing? No doubt about it! Professor Mochizuki was behind it after all! You should know after seeing my form before... I... I... was used in the professor‘s experiment! He rebuilt me. Stop it please, professor! Turning my body into a grasshopper's! Remodeling humans is a mistake! Quiet! I am merely making a stronger, more fearless, perfect life from! I ran off and became lost. I collapsed in the mountains... and slept till now. Truthfully... Something contacted me with telepathy. "Protect Hiroshi—kun from the Neo Life Form". Wait a moment! I don't understand what you're saying. Neo Life Form, is the perfect life form that the professor was researching. Fearless, fiendish, clever, and powerful. So you're saying the Neo Life Form my son created is after Hiroshi? Impossible! My son isn't like that! What would be his motive? What? Lies! Those are lies! Why are you lying?! Why?! Hiroshi—kun... Hiroshi-kun! Hiroshi, when you listen to music, don‘t you have a gentle feeling? Do you like this song too? Papa, it seems he like music too. What?! Don't do anything stupid! Hurry and get out! Let go! This watch! This watch! Hiroshi-kun! I don‘t need this watch anymore! It's broken anyway! This song... Hiroshi-kun. I... when I woke in the mountains. I was very mad at the Professor. But listening to this melody... makes me feel how much the Professor loved you. It's like I understand it. Papa said "all humans, when they listen to music, get a feeling of gentleness". He said that, but... He said that, but... ! Papa... He suddenly changed! Hiroshi-kun. The Professor I knew was like you said. He once was a gentle good man. But... the monster that attacked you... it's definitely the Neo Life Form. Everyone does their best to live... Loving each other... That shouldn't be destroyed. Your father tried to make you understand that... by having you hear this music. Bro... Let's go. Hiroshi... Hiroshi! Hiroshi... Papa! Hiroshi-kun! Papa! Hiroshi... Papa! Papa! Papa! Hiroshi-kun! I understand! Hiroshi-kun! Rider! Hiroshi-kun! Hiroshi-kun! Hang on! Rider... Rider! Rider... Professor? Professor Mochizuki! Papa? Hiroshi. Papa! The one who sent the telepathy... was you Professor? You? Forgive me, Rider. To save Hiroshi I did that to you... Professor Mochizuki! What were you doing with that Neo Life Form?! N—no... The grown Neo Life Form... It acted on it's own when I wasn't paying attention. What?! It... is still asleep in that pool. Hurry and run! Too late! Papa, well? Do I look like Hiroshi—kun? Stop it! He made me like this... and got Hiroshi involved... What else has it done?! You did this to the Professor?! He wouldn't listen to me. It‘s Papa's fault What? Papa became afraid when he saw my growth. Just a little more and I'd be a god and take back the minds from foolish humans. Humans... Because Papa taught me that humans use reason. 80, free me from this pool and let me be a perfect life form. Rider! Save Papa! Return Papa to normal! Hiroshi! Hiroshi-kun! Hiroshi-kun! Bro, no matter what you do, you can‘t beat me. You bastard. Bro! Hiroshi, destroy the pool. The source of his power is all in the pool. Henshin! What? Let me have your body bro. Rider! Kamen Rider is dead. So Papa, let me free... or else... I'II rip Hiroshi to pieces. Papa... Stop it! Hiroshi, are you okay? Papa! Papa! You like this song too? Rider! Papa... Hiroshi... Papa... Papa! Hiroshi-kun! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Bro, are you going? Hiroshi—kun... Cheer up! You still have your grandpa, and the girl from the dojo right? Hiroshi! Grandpa! Are you okay? Take care. Good! Bro! Rider!
