David's Birthday I could have sworn I put it on vibrate. You fool! Sorry, these things happen. I'm going to kill him... Leonard's here! Did you know he was back in Italy? My brother never tells me anything. Hear that? Leonard's here. Great... Are you happy? You like it? Very much so, but there's too much is Schopenhauer in the Wagner. Is deleterious, unhealthy. What did he say? There's too many Schopenhauer... Where? You're here and didn't even call? Do you like it? Very much! Even if Wagner is a bit... A pain in the ass? Heavy. And Diego? Since I've been back in Italy, I've hardly seen him. I've been in Milan. It's about a love so absolute, so devastating. Who wouldn't want that? Here's your coffee... Thank you! I'm going back in. We'll finish our drinks and our silly chit-chat. You go on and study, then give us a cheat sheet on the second act. There are two acts, right? Three? Great... What's happening this summer? We decided to spend the entire summer together. I found a house... Wait til you see it! Here we are... It's like a maze in here. Come on, read us something. Enlighten us. Not in the mood to enlighten. David's meeting us there. Great. Just you three? No, Francesca and Matteo too. ...Tristan und Isolde unknowingly drink the love potion and become prey to their own impulses without ever facing up to them because, as Freud points out... powerful subconscious... Wake up! ...forces act within us... Honey, tonight, you're coming to dinner with us. No, Shary... Why not? Tonight I really can't. Tomorrow I have a 20 hour flight... But I promise that when I get back I'll come visit you. Their story is an unexplainable race towards destruction. Too bad... Eternally unlucky! No joking, you had better come. It's about to begin. Where's Shary? I'll go to check. Everything okay? Sorry. I ran late. Leonard? I'll tell you later. So I'll put, as a friend Johnny Depp, as a lover, Brad Pitt, and as a husband... McEwan... and you? Brad for everything. You can't. Okay, then... Brad as a husband, Depp as a lover and McEwan as a friend. Listen, though, there's a grain of truth in this nonsense... After years with a guy like Diego, I chose a writer for a husband... You're married to an intellectual, yet you chose Brad Pitt... Intellectual pursuits under the sun? We're looking for the perfect man for an affair... You won't find men in a magazine. Pick up someone on the beach. Honey, we don't "pick-up", we get picked up by men on the beach while our husbands are trying to "pick-up" girls on the beach... Have you heard these two? Why? They've already lost it, and it's only our first day of vacation. Daddy, what did they lose? That your mom's gone a bit whacky. Paul Newman wasn't an option? I hate you guys! I'm always the bitch. But if it weren't for me... That's right Shary, tell him! Who found the house? True, it's gorgeous. Shary's incomparable taste... Incomparable... When does Leonard get here? He's still in Australia. I hope I get to see my gallivanting brother. How's he doing? So-so, he's not over it yet. Leonard's always been independent, but he had an incredible bond with Isabelle. They were connected, more so than any couple I've seen... When did it happen? What is it now? Nearly two and a half years ago. Come on Matt! Just pour the fucking wine. He's smelling it like a bloodhound! You know David's coming next week? You've told us at least ten times. Underneath it all, the "daddy" in you comes out... He's going to stay until his birthday. Who's David? David is Shary and Diego's son. He lives in New York with Shary. Is he a kid like me? No, he's a bit bigger... Can I still play with him? Sure, if he wants to. In the meantime, play with me. Give me a kiss! Let's play "shirt maker"! Pens and paper? What's shirt maker? You explain, I don't remember that well. Yes, you explain. It's great, Shary and I spent entire summers playing. You have two initials and have to list famous people whose names begin with those letters. Whoever lists the most, wins. It's good fun. Like for example... For example: A.D. A.D. Alexandre Dumas... Anton Dvorak. Alex Del Piero. See, that's already wrong. Why? There's also a P: the P in Piero. Andrea Dubini. Who? The pal of mine from Ponza. What's he got to do with it? You all know him, don't you? Sure, we all know him. He's very well known... in Ponza. I want to relax for a whole month. Exactly. I have to go back a few times, to see a patient. Desperate case? Crazy lady? Bizarre! Bizarre? How long's it been since I've seen your son? The last time he came to Italy was five years ago. No, it was before that... The last time I saw him was... New Year's Eve at your house... He was around 8 years old. Damn, it has been a long time. When I see kids now, I can't believe I had a son at their age. It's different now! How's that? They are really kids. No... we're different now. 15 years ago we were like them, at least I was. You're right... Maybe this time you're right. You'd never believe it if I was right about something. "If I were right." Who? Subjunctive. Subjunctive! You always have to be a pain-in-the-ass know-it-all... I can never commit to anything. Having a son at that age isn't easy for anyone... Even if, you did somewhat go off the deep end... Thanks for the "somewhat". Remember when... Let's not rake over my embarrassing past. When you wanted to be an actor and you permed your hair? Not only permed, but dyed it blonde like that guy... that guy from "The Blue Lagoon". The worst...! And all so I wouldn't end up in my father's firm. And yet... here I am! You always chose what you wanted to do. What choice did I have? My mother and father died, I was broke. But you were determined to get to where you are... You never made a false move. You've always been a grown up. Responsible. A pain-in-the ass? A pain-in-the ass! Had I been born into a better situation, maybe I would have been more of a slacker... Like me? Here we go again. Stop taking everything so personally. Want to head home? It's getting chilly. Yes, auntie, let's go inside. I haven't done a thing with my life, not even with Shary. What kind of relationship do we have? We're lucky if we see each other every 3 months. It's just not normal. I want a family but then, I fuck the first girl who walks by... I even fuck the secretary... my Dad's secretary. No... Mrs. Dina? What am I, schizoid? You're incontinent. Stop it, be serious! You, Shary and David, even if you are far apart, even in your unusual way, you're already "something". You think? I hate sandy feet. May I... Don't say you two smoked a joint. No, we just whacked off. That's more like it. What the hell do you and Matteo have to talk about? Twenty years with these confessions. What, are you jealous? Hey, remember Matteo is my friend. I meant jealous of me, not for Matteo. Enough of this nonsense, full immersion. Open the ship galleys! I wonder if they're back from the airport yet. Okay, he's here. Hi David. I'm Matteo... Remember me? Sure I do. You used to hold me in your arms. Welcome. Elena! Honey, it's very sunny. Don't you want your hat? Thanks, David! It's too hot to keep her at the beach... She should go to my sister's in the mountains. Her cousins are there, other children her age... Pippo Baudo? Where? No, the other night I lost with P.B. I didn't think of Pippo Baudo. Elena! Your mom is crazy. Look who's here! Francesca and Shary. Massimo! When did you two get here? Last night. How wonderful! We're going to spend the summer together. In Rome, we never get to see one another. And this gal's always in New York or Milan. Unlucky thing! Flaminia, you look great. Sure, considering her age! Silly! Yes, I'm good. You two also look well. Yes, very well. Orazio? Is he here too? Yes, there'd be trouble if he missed a summer here. Wasn't your son supposed to come as well? Yes. David! Him? Yes. Oh poor thing. What a loser! Sweetie, get me an orange soda. Chicca, did you see him? Who? An ice cream cone. Two euros. No, I don't think so... I know it is. Go and ask him... Oh, come on, Vanessa... Go! Thick skull, eh? Yes? Excuse me, were you in that ad... for bathing suits? Venessa was right. I'm Chicca. David. Can I introduce you to my friends? Okay. Vanessa. David. So you're a model? No, I go to college. You're not Italian, are you? Yes I am. But I live in New York. No way! So you're Shary and Diego's son. Yeah... Our parents are old friends. Really? Orazio. By the way, your dad's here. He's so young. Chicca, what the fuck? Gotta go, guys... We are always here... But at night we go to Axis... Why not just give him your number? Run or they'll jump you. Bye gys. Wow, he's hot. You made me look like an idiot. That's not true. You're all squabbling hens. Everything okay? Yes sweetie, fine, thanks. Look. Where? There. Where? ...when he came out of the water, he'd lost his swim suit! Daddy, that tickles! He always makes me laugh. It'll be a great summer. It'll be nice with dad. Have we got everything? Yes. Get some warmer clothes from home. I told the maid to put them out in Elena's bedroom. What's up? Nothing. Does Elena have to go? She doesn't "have to". I thought it'd be nice for her. We decided together. Now she's all excited... You're right. Sweetie... give a kiss to Aunt Laura, and to uncle Guido, and two kisses to Laia and Marko. Sure. Be careful mommy. Of what? Of everything. You always say that to me. You'll have loads of fun in the mountains. Got your seatbelt on? Yes. Tomorrow I have to see the patient. I'll be back in the afternoon. Okay. Drive slowly. I'll call you tonight. Bye. Bye I don't know what else to tell you. And you don't even say a word. I don't have any real problems. My students adore me. And we all know everyone hates their Latin teacher, it's a standard. My relationship with my husband has always been serene. Even if I look back to my parents, I don't remember anything tragic. Well, my relationship with my father was better than with my mother, who was a very strong woman: authoritarian, but not in any way... There we go. Perhaps this could be a starting point. Talk to me about authority... Now listen, I'm not authoritative with her. Now her name is "her"? All right, my daughter... Stefania.... Stefania, is she your only child? Yes. But why do we label everything with some diagnosis? Why can't we accept we're human beings with faults? A mother "must" love her children, children "must" love their parents. Who says so? This is probably, no, definitely a less attractive, less noble side of me and I'm not proud of it. Nor happy. I'm not an idiot. But it happened, that's just how it is. Everyone has shadow zones, right? No, or is it just me? I don't wish any harm. Absolutely not. But I can't stand her. I honestly can't fucking stand her. Hi. Hi. It's pointless. There's no wind. This is so embarrassing! Is that your dad? The one on the right. The other guy's a friend of folks. When were you last in Italy? Around five years ago. Five years? Five years since you've seen your father? No, he comes over sometimes. Always at Christmas... Your parents separated too? Actually no. That is... I don't know, I've never really understood. Hi David! Hi! Aurora... Did you gave him your number? No, I gave her mine. Here's auntie's lemonade. Why don't we take a swim? A swim? No, I'm reading. What? Proust! You're so intellectual. And you're sp ignorant, Diego. What's going on in this head of yours? Come on, let's go. Matteo... what are you doing here? Nothing... I just wanted to see this room, it's nice! Yes. I can't find Diego. Can you go buy some milk? David drinks gallons. Sure. Thanks! You've made some friends. Acquaintances. Are they nice? Sea bass? Is it fresh? Nice enough... A bit young. They all talk about stupid stuff. No sea bass? One moment. What do you mean? Chat, i-pod, girls... stupid stuff. Who knows if this fish is fresh? Doesn't look like it... What's wrong with that? Nothing. But they all act stupid. Because you're good looking... Can't we change the subject? Just tell me one thing! Is there fresh sea bass for seven or not? I've been here for 15 minutes... Dad, we just got here. Flaminia and Massimo are coming too. Sea bass? No, eh? What about that girl? The one from before? Mom's right when she says you never fucking understand... Hey, be respectful! Mom says that? Sometimes, Anyways, Aurora's nice. She can talk about other stuff. That's good. Sea bass! Is there any fucking sea bass? Yeah. Thanks! That's my son. These are sardines, right? Classical recipe, eh? Good... now someone can help me with this sea bass. What the hell is this? What? You tell me what this is. Are you nuts? I told you about them. You think this is appropriate for a boy? Why? Why? These are fag pictures! They're, how can I say, not masculine. I didn't realize Mussolini was the father of my child. Fuck you, just laugh. I'd like to point out that up until last year you'd lock yourself in the bathroom with friends to smoke joints. What's that got to do with it? It has everything to do with it. If you're going to be strict, that's fine, but be a father, don't play the deadbeat at 40. Since you decided to raise up our son, I hoped, that you'd have given more guidelines than me... Christ! We won't discuss your lousy grammar, but I'm didn't decide to bring up David by myself: you left me alone, you backed out at the last minute because it was easier working in your dad's firm, than risking to do anything on your own! Don't change the subject. I'm not! Our son isn't well brought-up, he's extremely well brought-up... Unlike you Italians, we don't say everything's a sin then go whoring behind our parthners' backs. Now, certain behavior, which you may think less masculine, is normal because, luckily, today's kids aren't like you and your pals who think the coolest guy is the one who farts loudest. Forget it, just forget it all. David... is doing great at school, even though you're not aware. He's good at sports... and it annoys you that he could do whatever he wants, but you ended up in a job you hate, with your father, who treats you like shit. So don't you dare ever tell me how to bring up our son! Don't you dare! And take off those headphones, no one ever calls you. Sorry. Come in Francesca. I'm done. The sea bass? Hey... what are you doing? Let's fuck without talking. Shut up. Like it, Marina? Tell me. Martina, not Marina. Yes, Martina. If that's how it's going to be... wake me up every night! I decide when and where to do it. The female, she doesn't say a word. Shary and Diego were arguing again. What about? Don't know... David, I think. What do you think David's like? Normal. Like all kids his age. Come on, let's sleep. 'Night. 'Night. That's so not true, Shary. You always said in your house there was no daily routine... your father was always traveling around the world, your mother, amazing as she was, was a prima donna, You all loved one another but you were always arguing, ...except for Leonard. God knows where he came from. So don't be so inflexible... All three of you are together, don't throw this chance away. I shouldn't be so hard on him. I have to accept him for who he is, even if it's just for David, He doesn't say it, but I can see he's looking for a strong role model. Diego is an inconsistent father. Look at Matteo. Matteo's excellent with Elena, but don't think it's easy with him. Sometimes it's like he'll do anything to belittle you. Because of his education, his profession... or because he made it on his own. Sometimes I feel so... ...inadequate. I can imagine... but you have a man, not a man-child. I bet the sex is still great. Yes... Last night he practically raped me. He attacked me in my sleep! I'm a doctor! What's going on? What's happening? They're saying someone drowned. Oh God, who? Don't look. Want to go for a ride? You drive well. You drive well! I like motorcycles. I found this in the garage. We forgot our helmet. Who cares! No one uses them in Italy. Not true! I use them. All right, fine... Hi ladies! Hi! How are you? Good! More beautiful than ever. Thank you, Massimo. I needed a compliment. Doesn't Diego compliment you? He doesn't notice my clothes. Is Mateo the same way? No, he's very attentive. If he doesn't notice you tonight, worry: that's an amazing dress. It was my mother's. An original from the '70s. So, are things better? Better. I just haven't accepted, even at my age, that evil exists, that scary things happen from one moment to the next. The girl was so young... I'm being stupid... No. You're still a child. A very sensitive child. And that's the beauty of you. Thank you, Massimo. Here we are! Look at all these elegant people. Sir, why not compliment your wife? Look, I'm not his wife. No? They've been married and separated so often they can't remember. Okay, tonight I'm say something: you're truly... I want to find you the right words... enchanting. Give me a cigarette. Thanks... Are the kids here yet? Orazio told me they were meeting in town and then coming here. Hi. What happened? We had to put on make up too, you know. The kids are here. Where? Relax! Lucky your daughter's not here. Who knows what he'll do when Elena starts dating... What the fuck do you mean? Give it to me. You're drinking on an empty stomach. Give it to me. Typical analyst: calm, impeccable, but when he loses it, it's really bad. I'll drink this. Disgusting. Diego, look... your son's getting down to business. Look, look! Diego. David's a head-turner. Must be almost a problem to be so good looking? In my experience... There are other problems in life. Shall we eat? You're on a liquid diet. Should I get you some rice? Yes, thanks, lots of rice... and no bell peppers. Are you and Massimo always like this? It's amazing. Yes, we are. What can I say? We've been lucky. Yes! Lots of rice, no bell peppers. Everything okay? Yes, everything's okay. That's the third time you've asked. Well, you doen't seem okay. I've had to listen to nonsense all night. Poor Matteo, no one's ever his intellectual equal. His own wife for one! It's all nonsense. Hi kids. You having fun? The music is a bit dated, but it's fun anyway. So tactful, these kids... Do you have the keys to the house? Yes. Please, don't be too late. Be late... Bye! Excuse me! She's cute. They are like two little love bugs... Yes, it's pretty sweet. Matteo, got a cigarette? What are you eating? Buy you own fucking cigarettes! What's going on? Fuck! Shary... You always have to appear like the Madonna? How did you get in? I ran into David. He was coming back from a party. If I'd known... I'm sorry. How are you? Fine, and you? Francesca... I'm sorry. Really... forgive me. We were supposed to examine volcanic rifts. It's an uncontaminated area. We were near the aborigines. What are they like? Better off than we are. Good morning. There he is. Going to stay for a while? I think so. How about tennis one of these days? Matteo, he needs to rest. Sure. Thanks, Leonard. That way he can vent a bit. Oh yes... Because last night... a little on edge. Would you pass the juice? David, how did it go last night? You had fun with... What's her name? Who? What do you mean? Your girlfriend?Aurora. She's not my girlfriend. I saw you kissing her... Will you leave him alone? She kissed me. Feel like canoeing tomorrow? Sure, Diego. I'd like to go canoeing too. You guys in the mood for a little music? Sure, but don't put on that bad techno. No, don't worry. Say what you like, the music we danced to as kids was so much better. That techno stuff makes me sick. Yes, today's music has no feelings. This, on the other hand. Honey, come and dance with your mother! No thanks. You're ridiculous enough as it is. We are ridiculous. Sunday is my birthday. Can I invite a few people over? Of course! Let's have a party! Party! I've been trying, putting my all into it. Doctor, I swear, I've really been trying... Last week my husband wanted all four of us to go out to dinner... All four of you? There was supposed to be a friend of ours but he didn't come. You should have seen the clothes she showed up in! We were going to a restaurant... a little place by the sea, she wore a tight little outfit, tons of jewelry on, ugly jewelry at that, and this muddle of hair... You know, those women who go hiking with high heels on? Anyway... since it was her "name day" next day, I had a little gift for her: a splendid edition of Latin poetry. Gorgeous binding. With superlative critical notes included. "Oh how nice, thank you..." A week later and I went into her room. It looks like Barbie's bedroom... I found the book still wrapped in plastic! She hadn't even opened it, and on the bedside table was a well-read copy of Sydne Rome's "Buns of Steel" exercise manual! Do you often lie? No, I never lie. I omit. Potatoes... I think we got everything, no? Yes. We forgot mineral water. Here! David asked me to get cocoa. Speaking of... I've been meaning to ask you something about David... Don't you think he's been acting strangely? Even with that girl, what's her name? Aurora! Aurora! I saw them... What? He doesn't give a shit. All she does is chase after him, and he does... nothing! When I was his age, my hormones were all over the place! Have you seen my son? He has all the girls on the beach and he does nothing... maybe it's just my impression, I don't know... what do you think? I haven't noticed anything strange. It seems to me he's acting perfectly normal. Thanks. You're the analyst and that's all you can say? What do you want me to say? I don't see anything strange... Kids, at that age, often behave like that... they're introverted, moody... but it's normal. He's just going through a period... a period. How long's it been since you three spent any time together? He has to get used to this new situation. Understand? I was thinking that too. Did we get sugar? There's still something that's not quite right. When I was his age, I whacked off five times a day... That was you. "Honey, look at me." I hope that's everything. Leave it there, I'll put it away. I'll give you a hand. I'm going for a swim. There's a clean bathrobe on the bed. We forgot the sugar. Leonard... May I? Of course, sit down. It's... Isabelle? Yes. She was... is beautiful. Yes! Every once in a while, I watch it. Is that bad? No, there's nothing bad about it. Everybody thinks I'm still in a state of despair. It's not true. But I'm living for the moment when we'll be together again. It isn't painful to think about her. It's like thinking about God... if you believe in that. She was like... An epiphany. Yes. I looked at her and understood everything. I understood why I came into this world. Sorry. David! Hey, uncle Leonard. Since when do you call me uncle? I don't know. It's cool having an uncle like you. And ever since you've grown a beard, you're more uncle-like. I'll shave it off tonight then. Your mom was looking for you. I went running. All day. Yes. Alone? I wouldn't say "uncle-like", you seem like my grandfather! What an amazing life you have. Always travelling. Yes, but there's always the flip side of the coin. It is impossible to have a family... I don't want to have a family... I'd rather be alone. No way! These are great. Where did they come from? A closet, up there. Battisti... Marcella... Renato Zero. I loved this one! Loretta Goggi... Of course I know them. I was your age, God what memories! Just like he is now. Identical. Gorgeous, charming and indecisive. You, on the other hand... Anything to tell me about you? See you later, mom. Gorgeous! Italy really is the most beautiful place in the world. Too bad the Italians live here. He talked about Isabelle. I didn't dare ask him. How did she die? She was clinically depressed. She almost didn't seem suited for this world. She'd already tried to kill herself twice and the doctors knew she'd try again until she succeeded. They openly told Leonard... You've no idea what a beautiful person she was. He was always there for her. Never left her alone. I visited them three days before it happened... The strange thing is that she seemed serene that time. Very often, when they come to the decision they appear more calm, because unconsciously they feel it's all been resolved. Something's not right about Isabelle's death. There's some doubt about whether it actually was suicide. "On these islands, in ancient times, people were abducted and deceived.." What's up, Matteo? You seem kind of strange lately. It's just that... I find being at the sea difficult after a while and the heat... This year it's stifling. Greenhouse effect? Pass the ball! Take him out! He's out of shape! Can you to turn it down? Some people are trying to read. That's why we got such a big house. It doesn't bother me. Let's play shirt maker! Okay... let's play shirt maker then. Give me five more minutes. Meanwhile, go get the paper. Anyone want something cold to drink? You guys play. I'm going for a walk. I need to walk a bit. Shitty game, shitty day! Should I use these, or the others? These, of course! Since when do you eat rice off soup plates? Thanks. Should I set a place for David? How do I know? You don't know if your son will be here for lunch? That's right... you're here to take care of David! I'll help you. Christ! Don't worry, I'll do it. It's nothing to do with you. She's upset with me. What's going on? God, it's hot! I can't take it anymore. They said it was going to be a hot summer! I think Leonard has to leave soon. Too bad... Listen, Matteo... I've been wanting to talk to you about something... When we get back to Rome, I'd like to fix-up the house. The radiators have blackened the walls. There are humidity stains, cracks, a few things to fix-up... and while we're at it... What about the veranda? The one we saw in that magazine that you liked so much? That way you could read there, you can study... no one will bother you. You won't always have to go to your office. How about it? Sure. Good morning. Hello. What are you two doing? Hi, Flami. We have a few errands to run. We haven't seen you for days. Closed up in the castle! When are you going to let the drawbridge down? Let's plan something. We never see each other. Why not tonight? Why don't we go to "The Pier"? The food's great. Why not? Tonight... ...maybe not. but one of these evenings. That's fine. Anytime is good for us. Maybe we'll see you on the beach. We're going down around five. Okay then, see you there. What the fuck's their problem? Whatever it is... that was weird. So leave then... I already told you I had to go. What's the problem? You never change, you're incapable of being with other people. Whenever things aren't to your liking, you cut out. I don't think I run away from problems. I'd rather not play your emotional tug-of-war... I'm sorry. I love you... You know that. I'm here for you if you need to talk. Maybe about David. There's no ham left. What is it? Do you know her? No, I don't. Poor guy. Leonard... Two years ago I did a terrible thing. There are some roads you can't turn back on. Listen, do you want to come here on Sunday, there's a party? Okay... Your uncle can take you there another time. it's not going anywhere. You'd make us all very happy, I really want to see you. Daddy will come get you tomorrow, if you want. Okay pumpkin, whatever you want... I really, really want to see you and be with you, you know that? Yes, okay. A huge kiss. Put your aunt on, bye, my love. Laura, yes, I heard, she's very happy. Try to convince her. That way you and Guido can relax a bit. We'll talk tomorrow. Okay. Thanks for everything, Laura. Bye. Let me talk to her. She hung up. I won't even tell you what the hell happened. My sister, my brother in law called me an unfit mother, selfish... They told me I was ruining her life. Maybe my reaction... was a bit too much, but I'm not a monster, Doctor. I'm not a monster. Why doesn't she go? Why doesn't she just move out? No, Giuliana, you are not a monster. Doctor... that's the first time you've called me Giuliana. Leo, where are you going? I'm leaving. Weren't you going to tell me? They called me last night. You were out. David, why don't you come with me? That way I can show you what I do for a living. Sicily is beautiful. We'll call them later. I'll explain everything to them. I'll call a taxi. Leo, forgive me, but today's my birthday. They are having a party for me. I can't just take off... How about if I meet you in Sicily tomorrow or the day after? The taxi's here. I'll call you tomorrow morning. But come, all right? Promise? I promise. Happy Birthday, David. I'm going to say happy birthday in precisely... pass the butter, please, five hours: you were born at two in the afternoon. Your dad has no idea, you were born at three. At three o'clock. But this time you're justified. You were so nervous that day. God, I can't believe that I have a grown son. Too bad Leonard had to leave. Had to? Just say "wanted to". Maybe he didn't feel comfortable with us. Don't be silly. He had a great time. That's just how he is, an anarchist. Anyways, we have lots of things to do for the party. Francesca, we'd better buy a cake, because the one... Yes, it didn't turn out that great... The other day I was a bit down. Who knows, if you're down... maybe your cake... goes down too. Well, we're buying one. Diego, you know where you have to go, and you Matteo... Yes, Major! Forgive me. David's birthday is having more of an effect on me than I'd imagined. Stay still!
