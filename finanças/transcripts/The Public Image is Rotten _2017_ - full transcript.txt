If the kids wanna buy the record, it's called "Anarchy in the UK". It's out in the shops, they can make their own decisions. [John] This is no fun. There's not very much fun being in a band like that. We're completely thrown in the deep end right from the start. The sheer drudgery of having to deal with a management that really wasn't comprehending much at all. You know, it was more into the sensationalism aspect of the thing. [John laughs] Ever get the feeling you've been cheated. -Good night! -[crowd cheers] "Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?" It's just an off the cuff remark but it's based on so much thought. And, and-- and angles and positions that I've had to, like, uh, assume, tolerate and, uh, ultimately walk away from and that's what I did. I was expected to live up to the press' [bleeped]. -[interviewer] And did you? -No. [interviewer] Well, take for instance, um... That's why I was disliked. -[interviewer] Well, take for-- -I will not be a puppet. I will not act out somebody else's pantomime. I was fighting this, uh, ridiculous court case with Malcolm and the Sex Pistols. The situation was, uh, legally until it was proved in court, couldn't use the name Johnny Rotten. 'Cause it was contested so... John Lydon it was. Particularly, the management financially wanted to wreck me and all's I had really was the, uh, the deeds of the, uh, flat in Gunter Grove. It was very nice of the manager in hindsight to credit himself for the great, many things. But he could not in any way, shape or form, say, he created me, Steve, Paul, Glen or Sid. If you'd spend half an hour with John Lydon, you knew that he wasn't invented. His personal history and his life was what he was all about. Meningitis has been the one thing I've always struggled with. So my mom and dad are very quiet. And being the eldest and being ill all the time when I was young, I didn't really express meself very well. They hardly knew I was ill. 'Till, you know, he hasn't moved now for two weeks. I think he's ill. [laughs] I'd have fits and I suppose, like, acid trip delusions. That's when they brought me to the hospital 'cause the brain was completely gone on me. And I-- and I felt a bit like like an observer inside my own head. Meningitis, I don't, mind you, I was seven but what it did was it put me into a coma for three months. Lost my memory when I came out of that. Didn't know anybody or anything. Didn't recognize my parents. And, of course, it made common sense when the doctors and nurses go "But don't you think it must have come from somewhere?" Yeah. But where? Well, why would we lie to you? This is where you come from. Oh, me gosh, when that comes around to you and you realize, um... you didn't even remember your own parents, you feel so guilty. I've got such clear, painful memories of that, that feeling. Gah, that was a lot to go through. And there were moments in the next few years where I've had freak-outs. They'd have to call in people. There was one particular moment. I remember it very, very well. I've talked to my mother after about it. There's a bunch of complete strangers in white coats going, um, "Are not happy here? Do you want to leave?" "We'll take care of you." And they seemed ever so much more frightening than a situation I wasn't, uh, feeling very, like, safe with. And, and that was a very good decision to not go with that. And it went on like that for a whole, quite few years. I took on the role of looking out for my younger brothers. So I acted like a surrogate parent 'cause my father worked away a lot of the time, my mother was ill almost all of the time. I find myself back in the family. And then the memories would flood back in. and I'd realize I was in a family after all. And I had a second chance. Because when you lose your memory and it takes you four years to get it back. You got an awful long time as a young kid to work things out. I loved being the DJ as a child. When Mom and Dad would come back from the pub with all their friends. I'd be the one that would put the records on. And I'd watch them all night dancing. I knew what would next get them. You know, I remember he's having mad parties around here. Dancing on a table and breaking a table and John's dad... Next day, he's fixing a table but he's putting industrial bolts for it, like, you know what I mean? Everybody is to mix and match, you know? If, if mom and dad were having a party at your house, well then, you go next door on your own. Whoever that would be would be anyone that lived in neighborhood. [Reggie] Fins Park is a kind of place where... They're for everyone together. Black, white, yellow, pink, blue. Greek, Irish, Jamaican. And um... You'd gonna get on with it. [Johnny] I'd DJ'd reggae when I headed down to here in a reggae club. Deep reggae. Finsbury Park. You know, it's part of my background. After the Sex Pistols, Mr. Richard Branson, the owner of Virgin Records asked me to, uh, be some kind of adviser to what was good or bad reggae. Imma browsing the sounds office, wrapping the paper for the week. And the phone rang. And John was on the phone, he was with Richard Branson, and he was like, "How'd you fancy coming to Jamaica with me?" And then I ran into Don on the 52 Bus. 'Cause we lived around the corner from each other. Next thing I knew, Don was coming too. Right when I crossed the islands, on the jungle drums. Rich, white man, signing up, reggae artist. And for the next two weeks, there was like... exodus of musicians. to the Sheraton, trying to get a deal. That's was where we'd make the deal. At the Sheraton. Johnny Rotten was there with him. He's a fan of mine. [Vivien] They would look at John and sometimes they would say, "Look!", I can't do the action. "It's not him. It's him who did God save the Queen!" And then all of a sudden, "Yestreen, we Rasta." While John was in Jamaica, Malcolm was trying to shoot The Great Rock 'N Roll Swindle. And he sent a cameraman over to film John secretly. It was like a Keystone Cops film. Because we had this suite, like, on the level with the swimming pool, when then people be lurking in the bushes. Trying to get secret footage of me. [laughs] And I took it kind of as a compliment. You don't want me around. You don't wanna work with me. But you can't work without me. I worked with Malcolm on a point that we started making that film. Basically, the band split. And I was still wanting to make this film. At the time, we did laugh about it. But it, it was sort of covering up something which was John busting out, trying to discover who he could be as an artist in his own way. It was very, very good going to Jamaica for me. It was. It cleared my head in many ways. I'm grateful about that but the way the record company were viewing the outcome of that would be was, was very, very different from where my head was going. [music plays] [interviewer] What's stopping you forming another band or doing something...? [John] It's called Malcolm McLaren. As soon as I get him off my back, I'll be able to continue. Until then, I can't release anything without him taking a great, big, fat share of the profit. Would you like to start another band? Yes, I am. I'm rehearsing like all the time with loads of people. [interviewer] A lot of people think that maybe your first record would be a reggae record. A lot of people are totally wrong. [interviewer laughs] But you have formed a band already? No. But you're rehearsing with people? Yeah. They change every night. [laughter] For obvious reasons. Personality differences. I got back to London. I wanted immediately to start a new band and one that would approach it without that media mockery attached. So I used the term "Public Image Limited". And Public Image was a book written by Muriel Spark. Then it's about that media side of things can lead to deaths and destructions. It was quite poignant for me. Um, I was able to get a deal for PiL as a tag-on for the Pistols. So, we're off. But the record company was unamused by the band members that I picked. They wanted to see big names. I was completely uninterested in the prospect of that. Wobble was a very good friend of mine. And he was just about on the verge of learning how to play. Perfect. Just when I'm thinking, God, what I'm going to do meself, I got a phone call from John at home. He said, "Would you come over? Do you wanna be in a band?" So I was, "Wow. Fantastic." You know? [John] Jump from here. Keith Levene. I thought he was the best thing in The Clash. He was very unhappy. And I was unhappy in the Pistols. The night that I really bonded well with Keith, just, "I've had enough!" And so, when the Pistols finally fell apart, it was automatic that we work together. Next thing I knew, John was saying, "Let's do it." And I knew Wobble. And I said, "We want to use Wobble." Wow, you know, what a guitarist. You know, that's a real, his own sound there. You know? That's credibly rich. And of course, it was all fine to do it but actually, I suspect he's classically trained. I mean he's very well-educated. How many fucking genius can go... [plays guitar] You know, I mean how many times, yeah? [John] And Jim Walker responded to an advert. [Jim] I walked in the room and there is another drummer sitting there. And I just wanted to pick him up and throw him out of the room. 'Cause I was gonna get the job as far as I was concerned. I just remember thinking, "This bloke's really good. This is the one." Rotten's girlfriend came, Nora, and that's when I knew this is a big band, when I saw her. She was this blonde statuesque, German girl. Woman. No, she's a grown woman. And I thought, "Well, women like that don't hang around nobodies." So we'd managed to scrape and get together some pennies. Well, I had to, 'cause nobody else had any money. Then started rehearsing and the songs just flowed.

That's where Roxy Music and the Sex Pistols were. And they had a genius of an engineer named Bill Price. He was so cool to work with. We didn't work with him after that. [laughs] An assistant engineer, with a bit of a tough guy kind of vibe. And they treated me, I felt a bit disrespectfully at a pop, so... I bashed him up as I recall. And we had to get out of there quick. I mean, the place was cool. Welcome to your first recording session. ♪ Public image ♪ We were quite a wild band. And we'd drink and we caused trouble. There's always a huge undercurrent of potential danger at all times. The way that record starts out with Jah Wobble's baseline, um, that really in a, in a way really changed the landscape. It was like a, you know, a diagram of how to write a song. For us at least. For me, base starts and then the whole thing kicks in. ♪ The public image Belongs to me ♪ ♪ It's my entrance My own creation ♪ ♪ My grand finale My goodbye ♪ The PiL's first single had a kind of purity and ambition and experimentation about it that really seems to point to the future. And it was a great vindication of John that out of what happened at the end of the Sex Pistols. To come straight out of that with this, this new sound. It was really impressive. ♪ Goodbye ♪ So I think everybody was like probably looking, thinking he was gonna fall down after the Sex Pistols. And, uh, it was really, I think they were like, "Wow" This is really, really good. And then they were really disappointed when they heard the rest of the album. [laughs] My friends, they sort of thought the Public Image album would sound like that. And then you get into like "Annalisa" and some of the darker tracks. "Annalisa". It was a bizarre story. It's about a young 14-year old girl in Germany. Her parents were convinced she was possessed by demons. That's when they called in a priest and, uh, and, uh, they suffocated her while trying to ex-communicate these demons. It actually killed the poor girl. ♪ Annalisa Annalisa ♪ ♪ Annalisa Annalisa ♪ When I went to school, a Catholic school, there's the quiet threat. "Why don't you be an altar boy, a good little Catholic?" You know not to go anywhere near the priests. They get you on your own, anything could happen. We will all deliberately howl out tune. 'Cause you know, you'd be unacceptable for that role. They were scary monsters to me, the priests. You couldn't accurately describe physical molestation. You knew it was going on from the gossip. And you do everyday to be perceived as ugly and useless. Funny how I used all that years later. [laughs] My first gig was in Belgium with Bill. And there were some guy who was going like... in front of the stage. So like, so I went up and kicked him in the face. It turned out he was the head of security at the gaff. I mean, what was the head of security threatening me for anyways? It was just war. We were kept until four in the morning by 40 bikers that wanted to kill us. We ended up barricaded in the, uh, dressing room. ♪ Absurd ♪ ♪This is religion ♪ ♪ There's a liar on the altar ♪ ♪ The sermon never falter ♪ ♪ This is religion ♪ We were getting along perfectly and then, then the question came up about money. And, um, control. I always assumed we'd just be four people like The Beatles were four equal people in their band. And I knew Rotten had been in the Pistols obviously, and obviously, he was big and we weren't but we were all great musicians and I know he couldn't have done it without us, I figured. When PiL formed, I, I thought he's me mate and I'll trust him. You know, famous last words in the music business. It'll comes down to the money and, uh, there really wasn't the money there. I couldn't afford to keep them in, in regular wages and that led to all kinds of problems. 'Cause I, I ultimately was paying for everything. [choir singing in the background] We couldn't have, have shops open at Sundays and nothing could be done on Christmas Day at all. It actually wasn't against the law but it was presumed it was because of religious dogma. I was quite freaked out at that because, you know, why would anybody wanna go to a gig on Christmas Day when there's no, there's no transport. John's brother, Jimmy, asked me to do the security. 'Cause I was the face of football in them days. We basically crewed most of the Arsenal to do security. ♪ Ego-maniac traitor ♪ Allow people to be entertained on Christmas Day, you know. Why is that against the law? [crowd cheers] [Jim] It can go this way and that was it, I walked out and everyone burned. 'Cause I knew that it wasn't gonna get me anywhere being in that band. [Jim] Just being used, basically. [Johnny] I was really upset with Jim Walker leaving because I thought he was an incredible talent. In my view, we never bested Jim Walker and, and you lost a sense of the band. It was, uh, an immediate disaster, wasn't it? That, but still had to get on with it. Still had to like progress and continue. So then it was just kind of me, John, and Keith. Vicious' nude body was found today by his mother in a Greenwich Village apartment one day after he was released from jail. He died of what's described as an accidental type drug overdose. And that's really where, where the "Sid legend" comes from. It was a press campaign. [laughs] Rather than a, a ground swell on the streets. And it do, just, you know, with the death of my mate which made me very angry. It is when it went into '79, it was really, really like a pool kind of depression. The PiL camp was a little dark. I mean, everyone was doing something and some were doing everything. But some were going up, some were going down. And some were going sideways. I remember getting on the tube, going to rehearse with PiL, and saw Keith there. And I went and sat opposite him and he was nodding off, just like that, this guy, molding, so I went, "Keith." And he just, he was gone. And then I said to myself, "Johnny Boy" I said, talking to myself. "Make the most of this." Wobble and Keith never seen eye to eye. Trying to, um, make these things work. That was so profoundly different in their approaches. ♪ In your eyes ♪ Keith was out, commissioned for longer periods. And I'd be a bit softed up. Trying to get stuff happening. We started working in a manner. John, in a bit of a slop of depression, wanted to watch telly a lot. 'Cause a man died who was close to him. ♪ Never say the way Told me in your eyes ♪ [John] Hell on earth, really. Hell on earth. It was too confusing and upsetting and I tried juxtapositional these different things in my head and deal with them accurately. Led to an excellent song called "Deaf Disco". But I already had the song in my head for my mama, I sang it to her at the hospital. This should be fought per leave and we got back to recording it. It was, uh... so upsetting and my dad just, "You can't say that. She's dying." And she laughed. And found it great fun and I think... I think, honesty, when people are on their deathbed, it's the most important thing you can deliver to them. ♪ Never really know ♪ ♪ Never realize ♪ ♪ Silence in your eyes ♪ ♪ Silence in your eyes ♪ [John] We did actually audition many drummers. "Here's a new drummer." "Okay, set up." "We'll just leave the tape running anyway and see if we can work around it." Well, there's all manners. Reggae drummers turned up, disco drummers. I spoke to Keith. And Keith said, "We're doing something at the townhouse this weekend." I thought, oh, this is my, you know, I should learn the songs 'cause we're gonna obviously be rehearsing. I walked into the studio and over in the distance, there's a glass, plexiglass room with the orange Rogers drum kit. And so I was like, yeah, "Here we go!" "Here we go what?" "Rolling!" And we did Bad Baby. Me and Wobble did Bad Baby. And, uh, in one take. [John] We really didn't have the money to screw around. We spent all our money on sillynesses like the album cover. [laughs] And, had no studio time, what we do is we'd find out what time certain bands would, uh, finish their sessions. We'd go in. When Metal Box came out, some people loved it, some people hated it. To a 14, 15-year old guy, it came in a metal tin, right? [laughs] Which... no other records did and, and it was just such an exciting idea. Metal Box like... It, it changed my life. That record. It changed the way I look at music. For me, it's up there. Like the great, electric bass records, just as a bass player of all times. Like Marvin Gaye What's Going On with James Jamerson. All the James Brown stuff. Family Man with Bob Marley. And Jah Wobble on Metal Box. That sound, that style of play changed everything for me. And when I first listened to it, it didn't make sense to me. And then after about a month, I completely fell in love with it. You know, and still to this day, Second Edition, uh, that's what's called in the state or Metal Box is one of my favorite albums ever made. It was a huge record. It was like, that was like the White album in the underground or something. It was crazy. How the whole... people discussed that record in a way. [John] It's, uh, it's about a rape of a young girl who was picked up and driven off to the forest in a Japanese car. And the only thing she could remember was, uh, the cassette on the car, the cassette player played "Poptones". And so I, I pieced the song together around those initial facts. I don't mean to be profiteering out of pain but sometimes you know, if you analyze the situation, it might in the future help stop such things happening. ♪ Side ♪ ♪ Pop tones ♪ [Martin] I used to go and hang out at Gunter Grove pretty much every weekend. Uh, get my wages, get my speed. I don't know that I was particularly close with John or anybody. I got along pretty good with Wobble. To the point where, um, Wobble invited me to work on the new, uh, demos for the next PiL album. ♪ The lack in yourself ♪ ♪ It is your nature ♪ The one thing I could do was book a ton of studio time whenever I wanted it for meself. And I could also do backing tracks for PiL. We went down to the studio. I told John, "Oh my God, this stuff's coming along really good." And he was just like... [laughs] It took like a month or two for me to find out we weren't working on PiL stuff. Jah Wobble did a record, Betrayal where he'd cover Fats Domino's "Blueberry Hill". It didn't cross my mind for a second that anyone would think it was to do with anyone betraying anybody in Public Image. And I think I, I played and co-wrote four or five of the tracks on Wobble's Betrayal album. And then, I guess something happened. We're in the Manor and, um, Wobble decided to go to town for the weekend. It was off. It was alright. On a Saturday, I wanted to go in and, uh, the master was gone. And I searched high and low and then it comes to pass that he'd taken it to London to record over his own stuff. And then, he thought he'd sneak it back in, Sunday night. Well, we were there sitting, waiting, weren't we? Nobody complained about me making solo records. John and Keith were really pissed at Wobble. For using some PiL tapes, I don't know what was going on. And he's destroying the bigger potential for this egotistical thing on the side. You know, sooner or later, we would find out. You think we're that dumb? [scoffs] "Oh look, isn't that a PiL backing track?" "Oh it sounds like it, did it?" [laughs] [music playing] ♪ Character Deep in your nature ♪ ♪ Take one example Sample and hold ♪ [Thurston] When they came to New York, it was a real bummer for me because I was in this band called The Coachmen. And we had a show the same night as the first Public Image show which was at this place, The Palladium in New York. New York City. My first time in the States. Here we fucking go, right? And it sold out. This person crawls on stage like... "What's going on?" like yeah, "John and Keith!" "I've gone back to the hotel." "What?" It's filthy embarrassing, you know? Especially as I knew a lot the audience has finally got it. [faint cheering crowd] You know, maybe, we're just gonna crew out a list of songs here... [noisy background] [music starts playing] [Martin] Next night, we played Great Gildersleeves. I think I started to experience at that time, charisma. He could stare down at an audience and keep them at bay. And John certainly could. [upbeat music] Joining me are Mr. John Lydon who used to be known as Johnny Rotten and Mr. Keith Levene and they are both associated now in something which is called Public Image Limited. What is that? Is it a band? Is it a public relations firm? What is it doing? What is it? We ain't no band. We're a company. Simple. Nothing to do with Rock 'N Roll. All they talked about, uh, you know, umbrellas, companies, and companies and the standard album was all just nonsense really. What we needed to do was gone play shows. And I think the reason it's a good idea not to be a Rock 'N Roll band to concentrate or direct out energies as a company is because... [John] Well, look to the future, right... [overlapping dialogue] [overlapping dialogue] [John] ...days are here. Excuse me. We were talking while you were interrupting -I have to do... -[John laughs] -...continue not for long. -[John] Humor me. I think it was important for them to sort of do something like that. To not wanna be a part of anything that becomes sort of standardized or corporatized, you know, by the industry, you know, being a Rock 'N Roll band, you know, how boring. Why be something that you're not? Or why be something that everybody else is? The whole PiL being a corporation, I think, stylistically, that's where their ideas were coming from. From the whole acronym PiL, the whole, um, presentation of everything was done in a very kind of, uh, they were taking tips from the corporate world and putting a twist on it like John always does. Well, we're still a company. We always have been. Rather than a pop band rented by a record label and told what to do. [music playing] Went to America, toured America. And then, came back and, uh, went to the house. I knew there was money in cash in a shoe box. I see it and now I'm done. And I'm taking the box of cash with me so I took off. Shoe box for the cash. And went back off to America on a holiday. Hard to fund a bird car. Or make. He's such a used car salesman. He's so prone to doing those what we call shifty maneuvers. It's, uh, street-y kind of behavior. And it's a kind of behavior that doesn't belong in a band. When I left, I said, "John, I'm gonna leave." "Okay-fucking-bye." [scoffs] [laughs] "See you later." [John] Using PiL material to record his own stuff, that kind of, um, selfishness is really hard to, to understand or tolerate by me because, um, what was contributed very, very well but he took more than he gave. [crowd cheers] I don't see the need to lie. I've been lied to and I know the pain of that. I want you to imagine you've lost your memory completely. Now, when you're seven or eight years old, it's a little bit more destructive. And so, the hurt of a lie really, really affects you for the rest of your life. I was in Ireland to see my brother's band, the 4" Be 2"s. And, uh, off-duty policeman behaved quite aggressive in a pub. I didn't know there were policemen. You know, until a push comes to shove, you shove back. It was upsetting because we spent our week in Mountjoy. That was a serious piece of jail to have to be in. And then, I immediately went back to London and went straight into the studio and started working on The Flowers of Romance. We only had like a few weeks to do this before he was gonna, you know, be sentenced. [John] I had a studio book. I had me in it. And I had no one around me because there was no band and I had to do the best I could. [Nick] Keith sometimes coming in in a great mood plays something. It was brilliant. And then disappear and then come back and he'd listen to what he'd done earlier and hate it. [John] We were so out of tune with each other. And I just got out of Mountjoy jail. You know, I was full of the gifts of life, I'm free! And I wanted to work, work and work. The way that most of the songs came about on Flowers of Romance was that Martin Atkins would come in relatively early when I came in. And I got these huge drum sounds with no particular drum part in mine's. ♪ Down in the dark Tell us a story ♪ ♪ From the room below ♪ [Martin] I had a Mickey Mouse watch from Disneyland. And I, I slept with it under my pillow. Speeding, couldn't sleep and I heard those [imitates beats] And I was like, just, I could hear these beats in my head. Nick was fucking awesome. He put the watch on the floor tom-tom. Like "What is he doing?", "So it's gonna resonate." Put like two mics on it and then fed it to a harmonizer. It was like one plus one equals 11. [beeping] Once we had that, you know, good five minutes of that on tape then Martin went out and played that incredible beat to it. [drums playing] Eventually, John would turn up and it would either be, "That's a bloody load of rubbish.", you know, erase it, or he quite liked it and if he liked it, he would go into a vocal. Which was amazing because it was literally just a drum track. And he'd write lyrics, just, straight out of nowhere.

You're gonna end up sounding like everybody else. And if I were down about trying to be like everybody else, what would my music be? [music plays] There's always people. It was John's fucking apartment in Chelsea. All of us and the police. Not The Police the band. The police, the police. [siren blaring] Sometimes I go over there like Bum, bum, bum. Gunter Grove.

And surely after that, John had really had it with this country. And he left for New York. And Public Image set up there. ♪ Just look around ♪ ♪ I think you'll find that Everyone has the same problem ♪ [cars honking] ♪ This is not a real home ♪ There was a show at the Ritz which was kind of a big downtown rock theater. We had a sold out show with Bow Wow Wow. Day before the events, that, uh, we got a call from Malcolm McLaren. And he said, "We're not coming." I called, uh, the publicity department at Warner Bros. And they were there and I said, "We don't know each other but our weekend just opened up because Bow Wow Wow cancelled." And I think they thought that was a bit humorous because of the Malcolm connection. [John] That the idea was to play along with the record on the turntable. And we'd be pantomiming and creating images around all of this. ♪ Admiring hating This lot are ♪ The Ritz was famous for having the largest movie screen on the planet. [laughs] That's like their big thing. They came up with an idea. We'll do the show. But we never wanna come out from behind the screen. I didn't think we did say it was kind of, uh, performance art, if you will. I think it was, uh, promoted as PiL, a concert event. And I made sure that I was gonna see Public Image this time. So we called WLIR, the radio station in Long Island that was playing "New Wave". And um, I said, "I'll give you a pair, a couple pair of tickets." "Please announce on the air that Bow Wow Wow cancelled." "And it's PiL that are coming." -Well, in moments, tickets... -[snaps fingers] went like hotcakes. [Martin] And my phone just exploded. "Hey, can't wait to see you." "See me what?" "New York!" What... I don't know anything about it. That felt strange. And we thought, "Guess they found another drummer. Okay." Listen when I do it. [plays drums] From slow to fast. I'm talking to about six or seven drummers about why you have to practice and this lady comes in, waving a check and she says, "I need a drummer tonight. Are you working?" she yells at me. The place was jammed. Everybody showed up at this, at this gig. And see, we had a bit of kind of rough, rough neck audience. I walked in. Got on the stage. And we were behind this big movie screen. I said, "What do you guys want me to do?" And Johnny Rotten says to me, "Gimme a lot of tom-toms." [imitates drumming sound] [crowd cheering] Flowers of Romance is being played. The lights are beautiful. But you could feel some kind of tension in the air. They wanted to see the PiL live. As soon as I started, people started throwing things at the screen. They don't wanna see silhouettes. [crowd jeering] All of a sudden, um, there's a huge image of John Lydon on the screen and he was taunting the audience. He was up there like huge, like Wizard of Oz. [inaudible talking] [continuous crowd jeering] [inaudible talking] And all of a sudden, there's a real live human being on stage. It was Keith Levene. And he was waving his arms and he's saying, "Stop throwing things at the screen!" [laughs] And then he had to run off because bottles were being thrown at his head. Chairs started flying. The screen that was a very expensive screen, kids started pulling it down. It became dangerous. And all the lights in the place went up. Police came in. And the entire place was evacuated and it was the end of the show. For me, it was like, that's like one of the greatest gigs I ever saw. [laughs] So good. [John] I look back at it and it's probably one of the greatest gigs I've ever done. You sink or swim, really, in those moments. If you can, uh, make good of what could be the end of your career. [laughter] [music playing] When I started working with the band, they had never really had anyone that was in an administrative role as, as a manager per se. And that they always dealt with the record company and they always dealt with the business themselves. I took on the role of a manager but again, we weren't calling me that. As an official title, I've never liked that anyways since Malcolm commits him. You know, that was management and that's exactly what we're never going to have anywhere near us ever again. [Bob] I met Keith and we instantly bonded. We'd put together ideas of the game plan and then John basically gave his seal of approval. I knew Martin Atkins also, the drummer who had left at the time. But I kind of brought Martin back into the fold. I worked out a deal with the studio on 58th Street called Park South where there would be some speck time and we would pay some money. And we started working and recording there. ["Mad Max" playing] ♪ Call me up after midnight Tell me I'm wrong ♪ ♪ Tell me I'm right What do you want ♪ ♪ Did you just Need the argument ♪ [Martin] We needed a bass player so I called Pete Jones. "Hey Pete. It's kind of a fucking insane thing, you want to come on and play bass?" And I said, "Okay. I'll do it. Okay. I'll do it. Alright." And then I flew straight to New York. I literally walked in to the studio and they said, "Okay. can you play along to this." Probably soon after that, we moved into the lroquois Hotel. Which is crazy, The Clash were there. They were doing this series of dates in Times Square. I remember being in an elevator with The Clash and was like, We're The Clash, we're the PiL, you know. Just stupidity. [reporter]John Lydon's new band is Public Image Limited. They're playing tonight at the Roseland Ballroom. The music and dress are different from the Sex Pistol days. But the news that punk is dead has not reached the fans. They wouldn't believe it! The press from it was great. The band was excited, you know, everyone was excited and now, PiL was back. [upbeat music] [interviewer] Gonna do major venues, extensive tours, small tours? Kind of, um... We don't do tours. We just do gigs occasionally. Once every two or three days. It's better that way. It wasn't, it wasn't a tour. It was a series of dates so we'll do mad things like we'd go get a plane to Seattle. So we don't fly to Seattle. The whole band, crew hang us on. Then we fly back again. And we can't do that sort of traveling and that sort of distance and make money. It's just financial suicide. So there may have been concerns like, "Why aren't we all rich? We're doing all these shows." We came back to New York and we gave, you know, half of that to the studio. And now there's $3,000 left. So yeah, you can have $500 each or something. The hotel bill wasn't being paid and they threatened to throw me out. I said, look, "You need to pay this bill and I need some money." And Keith's reply to that was, "We're all individuals in this band." I'm like, "What the... what the fuck?" All of a sudden, I, uh, I get this call. Keith had gotten rid of me. And then, uh, this whole tension erupted within the band after me. It was a laugh playing live and stepping on stage with PiL was, was great. It was a great honor to play with that band. It's just became a trip, trip, trip, trip, trip of shit. I found Martin. Martin was living at the same place as John at the time so Martin took the call and I said, "Martin, I'm leaving the band." He said, "What'd you mean you're leaving? When are you leaving?" I said, "Tomorrow. I've got a ticket." "I'm flying out tomorrow morning." And he told John that while I was on the phone. And I heard just John screaming in the background, "Bollocks!" And that was all he said on it. He just shout out, "Bollocks!" and that was it. ["This Is Not A Love Song" playing] Yeah, that, that whole period of, of commercials on "This Is Not A Love Song" get, you know, I mean that stuff was written about in the press in a very, very disparaging way. You know, it was pretty well known that, that Keith was a little unwell, shall we say. [interviewer] You just finished your new album. And, uh, can you tell us a little about that? Its title and how it differs basically from what you've done in the past. Well, that's for the general public to... -decide. -Well, how were your impressions on how it, how it differs 'cause everything has to be a progression, doesn't it? I'm just happy to do it, right? That's all. Can you compare it to the last ones? -What albums? -You can compare it to anything. Yeah, yeah. Would you? Um, it's gonna be better. In what way? Well, it's like, um, it's one album more than what we've done before. So it's got everything we've done from those last ones plus us now. But here's the thing with Keith, he's alleged genius. My God, many of the time, it was murder trying to deal with what, with what he was coming up with in the studio 'cause he was so off the mark. ♪ Think you know the answer? ♪ ♪ Think you got All the problems? ♪ ♪ Well, why not try And solve them? ♪ ♪ Instead of your Sitting on them ♪ Not it's just too much temptation, really, in New York. Everybody was tempted by so many peripheral things. Including meself. And there was a lot of that cocaine floating around which can screw up an awful lot of things. That was a hard one to like, you know, walk away from. I decided I couldn't bear that kind of sickness every morning. For me, it's things that keep me awake. That's like the things I'm interested in. The longer I'm awake, the less chance of waking up for a sleep-- from a sleep and not knowing who I am. I never, ever want to go through that, that period in the hospital of not knowing who I was. I knew that substance is... way, way earlier out of my youth and so I know not to like fall into them issues. But some of the more hardcore drugs like heroine, if that's flirting about, that's really soul destroying. And I've watched that drug now reckon destroy so many friends. I have a real, uh, animosity about heroin, heroin users. Yeah, heroin users but it'd ended up using you to fuel their addiction and their addiction becomes the preeminent thing in their life. The only driving force, really. ♪ Getting nowhere ♪ Piles of confusion, massive amounts of irritation, uh... kind of, all of this, I think ended up feeling like headless chickens throughout all of it. [faint crowd cheers] We were offered 15 shows in Japan. Um, for 100 or 150 thousand dollars. It's a lot of fucking money. Paul McCartney goes to Japan with Wings. With a kilo of weed. And he's arrested. Subsequently, every performance contract for a touring band in Japan has what's called the "Paul McCartney clause" inserted. Which means if anybody's found with drugs, not only do you not get paid for your tour, you're liable for what the promoter thinks you might have made. So of course, we start looking down the barrel of the gun of taking Keith into that situation. We asked to have a meeting. Keith showed up with his attorney. What's this, the fucking Eagles? He made the sensible decision. Ba-bye. Don't care how important a member is, they're not that important. You can't be doing this for utterly selfish reasons. We're supposed to be in this together. Ultimately, it really doesn't matter. Listen to some of that playing. For God's sake, you know? Just listen to that, nothing else. Not anything is Wobble's. That is talent. And no one can ever take that away from him except himself. Keith has said... Commercial Zone, it's his version of the album. It isn't. It was our version of an earlier album. There were songs on there that he didn't know existed until he stole the tapes. [music plays] Keith eventually organized a release of Commercial Zone. Got it pressed up, had it released in America outside of the Virgin control. Yet again, one more time, somebody being greedy and selfish with PiL stuff. I thought that John was very pleased about that. But by this time, they've come off and re-recorded a lot of those songs for This Is What You Want... This Is What You Get album. So yeah, the Commercial Zone version of some of the songs are after the This Is What You Want version of the songs which are inferior of course. Some are. ♪ This is what you get This is what you want ♪ We'd find ourselves, just me and John, with this commitment for Japan.

I went to give Louis Bernardi, uh, the news that he got the job on bass to a holiday inn in Passaic, New Jersey. It's like a drug deal gone wrong, kind of weird thing. And I walked in and there's a band on stage playing "Rock The Casbah" and there's Louis playing bass with a fucking red beret. "Rock the Casbah..." like fuck, what have we done?

I'll go for that. Did it apply for your last record? I think so. It's rather wonderful. Making a lot of bucks? No, unfortunately, it hasn't been going at the, uh, commercial success that it deserves but I have patience. Emotionally, that, that was such a trying period. 'Cause I was going through incredible negativity from the media. They just wanted to bury me basically. Then I had to really, really fight for my survival here.

I remember just jamming for like 20 minutes. Well, that's it. Everybody can go home. We're done. The next day, they asked me if I wanted to join the band. And, obviously, and I thought, fuck, I gotta leave the Chili Peppers and I was so scared, I didn't know what to do. I remember that night, Hillel came over. Then I stayed up with him all night. Talking about it like, "What do I do? What do I do?" He was like, you know, "If you join PiL, it will never be your band." "Like it will never be your thing." So I called them that morning.

"I don't wanna let you down but I just wanted to let you know... I'm gonna be leaving at the end of it." And that was a huge fucking mistake. Not leaving. But telling him. Whereas our relationship was a little bit difficult up to that point. It fucking completely destroyed it. [John] Martin left after the, uh, the Japanese tour. We decided, like, not to be like bothered to go straight back to, uh, LA. And so, uh, we rented a house right on the North Shore and stayed there. It was great for testing but no more Martin.

On a such a, on a serious level. [drums beating] Ginger Baker's a nut up. He then trotted into the studio like, um, semi out of his complete mind. Fantastic person, I can say. I managed to like, uh, somehow, accidentally, hook-up and connect with. The wild car was Steve Vai. Who would've thought you'd bring a metal guitarist... He was used to his way of pining and that's not what we wanted. We wanted him to like, you know, go rhythmic with it. You know, play less. And it would mean more. [John] Alright, let's get on with it then. [Vivien] On this last record, um... How involved were in picking all the musicians and then the production and the whole thing? Because that wasn't done like a group, group. Well, very involved. I mean I've written almost all of the songs before I went into the studio. So I knew exactly what I wanted. Uh... so I just set about getting the musicians that would do the job best. The most amusing part about it was Tony Williams did half the record and I did half the record. And it was released without citing who was playing on what. And Tony and I laughed about it because every track Tony was on, they thought it was me. And every track I was on, they thought it was Tony. [laughs] [music playing] It wasn't like I was trying to sell you an album with a load of pony-ass, like, famous people. 'Cause everybody who became involved I told them way in advance. There would be no credits on this record at all. Everyone happy.

Sound advice, I think. Is this a general lyric or is this about specific friends that-- It's, it's general but it could apply to several of my ex-managers. I couldn't really remember the exact day when we stopped working together. But it was because we had a huge brawl, you know. The problems that we had, you know, working relationship was because we were friends as well. It made it difficult to separate the friendship from the work. Um, that got to a sort of breaking point. ♪ Disappointed a few people ♪ ♪ When friendship reared Its ugly head ♪ ♪ Disappointed a few people ♪ ♪ Well, isn't that What friends are for? ♪ ♪ What friends are for? What friends are for? ♪ ♪ What friends are for? What friends are for? ♪ ♪ What friends are for? ♪ [John] Many of my friends are convinced that it's about them personally and it really isn't. But the refrain in it that they don't grasp and they should 'cause it's a huge compliment is, uh, what friends are for. That's, that the bottom line. That you've up with the, uh, you know, the mistakes and errors of friends because you accept them for what they are. [engines roaring] So we didn't have any big falling yet. I think he was very pissed off when I left. Um, which is understandable. Really the reason that I stopped playing there was I was not in very good shape, I mean, I wasn't in good shape. We've been on tour all the time. I did-- was doing a lot of drugs. You know, basically the routine of album tour is six months of... optimism. Didn't really worked out so well for me. And with the drinking and drugs and nightlife. It just... got into a tailspin for me. It was either my health, well-being Or I was gonna die. I mean, I was gonna just... implode? Fall apart? And I had to bail. I've take set of people come and people go and it really breaks my heart. You know, and I obligate myself to the human beings. I don't want that to stop anytime soon. You gotta accept that it does.

You know it. -[interviewer laughs] -Nope. My baby's ran off and closed the door. -Yeah? -Nope, she's not gonna have it. [interviewer laughs] See, that's private. And that's how we are. It's not public domain. Say, do whatever you want about me but you're never gonna get the opportunity to do about that, the people that, that don't deserve that torture. I'll vow us through it. I loved this very, very much. The dragon in the corner. This is done by, um, I think it was Pablo. One of the twins. Ariane's kids. When they were young and they came to live with us. Ariane, the lead singer of The Slits, is, uh, my wife's daughter. Their mother, she just couldn't cope with them anymore. And you know, with her musical career. And they had a major, major brawl. I said, "Well, let them live with us." "We'll-- we'll take care of them." Then, so, you know, in, in what you can conceive as two decades of not working. [laughs] Johnny had to become daddy. [laughs] It was tough, man. It was tough because you're taking on two 14-year olds, you know. Had very serious opinions of, of the problems they had to endure up to that point with their own mother. ♪ Domestic bliss ♪ Give it a little time to, to settle it down into, into a proper family unit. Very, very difficult but, uh, I learned so much about meself because I, I found that bit that was missing in me for so long. That I loved the company of kids when they're young, I just really do. Terrific. And in a weird way, family-owned youth again. [music playing] If you look at all those video clips of them on television at the time, you know, and just like how antagonistic it is, you know. Especially on the Tom Snyder show, The Tomorrow Show in New York. That was like, people talked about that forever. How they just kind of like, um, completely took the piss from this guy, you know, just like you know, we're so combative to the point where he has to be late. [laughs] He was known then as Johnny Rotten, the head singer and founder of the Sex Pistols. He continued creating a vent of music in the 1980s with his band Public Image Limited. And after nearly 17 years since first we met, we're back together again tonight for the second time. John, welcome and thank you for joining us here at CBS. I don't what happened 17 years ago tonight. Yes, you do. You just showed it. [laughter] I mean, I don't know where I was or you were then but if I did something to offend you, I apologize for it. No, it's all right. I mean, it's just entertainment, isn't it, you know? TV. Exact-- right. It's only television. I sometimes forget that. John did some, um, some work with some TV films and programs. [animals howling] They say a gorilla was here. A gorilla. I think you'll like it, Lydon. He goes, I got nothing to say to gorillas, Well, we went out with gorillas we had the best time alive. John Lydon, punk superstar, national icon and mad-key natural historian. With best mate, John Rumbo, he's embarked on a once in a lifetime journey into the heart of East Africa. The ultimate aim of meeting his oldest relatives. The gorillas who date back to a time when dinosaurs ruled the Earth. [chanting in African language] [chanting in African language] ♪ This is pil Pil ♪ We were always mates for years, years and years. You know, I'd work and hang out with him every day. He do his thing, I do my thing. And, um, we just, eventually just teamed up properly, you know. It's hard sometimes because we're mates so it's hard whenever, we're not-- we never, ever, ever had an argument before I started working with John. Ever. We don't have any arguments. I want to get the best out of John. I didn't wanna do any more Pistol stuff. And John went, "Well, we could start PiL." And I was humming in high. 'Cause I thought it was almost an insurmountable barrier. 'Cause of a serious financial debt. It was always eaten away. I had to get this back together but I just didn't know how. Do I buy country life butter because it's British? [upbeat music] Bye, bye country life because I yearn for the British countryside. [honks car] Or because its made only from British milk? [cows moo] It's not about Great Britain, it's about great butter. Yeah, a butter company approaches and, you know, to be the, the spokesperson or figurehead for butter? [laughs] And naturally, instinctively, I said no but they said I'm basically a free hand. The money wasn't complete genius that came out of it, let me tell you. They got me on the cheap. But it definitely helped us set up PiL. [music playing] When I rang up Bruce, we haven't spoke in, oh, 18 years, something like that. I'm like, "Hello." He goes, "Hello, John." I certainly wasn't expecting it. Anybody said was, "If we can get this off the ground," you know, "would-- will you play?" It's kind of like that. Louis was just hilariously difficult to talk to. "Are you sure? You're putting your own money in it, John." "Don't put your own money into it." I'm like, "You can't be serious." 'Cause I remember John before and he was, I guess, pretty different than he is now. I think the difference is Rambo. As a manager, he's got John into a position where John can feel that he can do this, you know, in a particular way. I'll tell you, when I rang Wobble and spoke to him, I didn't recognize his voice at all. John called me. I was getting me feet done. It's already nice summer's day, rather cold. I like the old reflexology. Yeah, they talked about doing, you know, Would you come with us? I said, "Well, look... My people are sort of your people." You know, so... For me, it wasn't the venue we used to play either. It wasn't the way to do it either. So aesthetically, financially, could go over the first hurdle. And then it was really the bass player and Scott. It was great. [music playing] And I looked to his website and I thought, "Just genius." He's perfect PiL. He wrote everyone from Stevie Winwood to the Spice Girls. That sense of openness is completely what I'm always looking for in a human being. Major thing he was trying to make us all fit as one thing. Because he got the old stuff and all the stuff through the 80s and 90s, he's trying to make it fit as art. So like it's, it's coming from the same place where we played it live. [music plays] They did first rehearsals, absolutely guaranteed to be the-- These lads, my gosh. I mean, I put them in a room, I arrive slightly late the first day of rehearsal. And they were already banging way out of "Albatross". You know, not the most easiest of, of, of free form things to be approaching but gosh, I walked straight into the room, straight on to the mic, and bang, that was it. ♪ If I wanted to ♪ 'Cause it gets hard. Some of the players like "Albatross". There are no parts. There's just this scene that, scene this, scene just-- and they, and you can't say when anything will follow anything. And when John's singing, I have to sort of, sometimes I have to preempt things, sometimes I have to be after him. I've got no idea every time I play. And I'd never want to play it the same way twice because it would kill him. ♪ You are and always will be ♪ ♪ Unbearable ♪ ♪ You ran away ♪ ♪ You ran away ♪ ♪ You ran away ♪ ♪ You ran away ♪ [John] I have many, many managers over the years. You constantly tryna get some kind of structure in my life that would work and, and I find the only way that really works best for me is Rambo because he's, he's um, he's like me and he's not really dependable. I just want a little man. It isn't, Dave. It's not quite finished yet. Is this my standing position? Indeed. Am I allowed to go outside or is that-- [John] I mean now, there's some security presence in PiL, it is, it's Rambo standing on one side. So I'm there. I'm also feeling, you know, I don't wanna get too focused on the music, I'm watching the crowd. I could spot someone that might try to get on the stage. If they get on stage, sometimes they're okay. Some are like, I'm gonna fight you. ♪ Better days ♪ ♪ Better days will never be ♪ ♪ Better days will never be ♪ ♪ Better days will never be ♪ [John] Let's go around once more. You fucking idiots. [crowd cheers] Yow! With also like to watch out as well when security, security beating ourselves to the crowd. I'll let John know and I'll let John say something. You know, we don't hold any punches, we really love our crowd. They come to support us so you know, we really want them to be part of it and not be bullied. [faint music] There you go. Last night. [sighs] Before we start all over again. I think I'm gonna miss it, I'm gonna miss it like mad and the gaps are gonna drive me nuts. 'Cause I've got, I've got to really, really like doing this. First time in 30 years. It's like, it's not painful. -It's fucking enjoyable. -[laughter] [exhales] -First count. -First count, come on. -[John blowing nose] -[crowd cheering] Yeah, right.
