Papa will drop Teena aunty at the bus stop and come back. "Is Teena aunty a small kid to drop her off?" Aww! Aren't you the big boy now? Isn't Teena aunty still a kid? Papa will be back soon. Ok, dear? - Good night! - Ok, good night! - Bye! - Hello? - Yeah! You caught the train? No. I was a bit late to leave the office. Deepak will drop me at the highway now. I'll get a bus from there. If you say roughly by what time you'll reach, I'll come to pick you up. No need to come, Roy! Just keep the keys by the window, and go to bed. 'I'll be with you by the time you wake up." - Ok, good night! - Good night! I thought you would stay awake and wait for me! You were the one who asked me to sleep! You fell from the bike again? Oh! It's alright! Once you finish writing your current novel, leave your job then. You don't need to drive in the traffic anymore, then! Even if you feel like writing something new, you can be here and write, full time! Oh! Is it enough that I simply sit and write the whole time? Only 100 rupees, madam? That's what you said earlier! A bit more for dropping you off here, in one piece! Get going if you wanna leave in one piece! Oh! You didn't keep the keys, isn't it? If I keep them, you wouldn't wake me up! So? You fell down from the bike again? No! You must've dreamt about it! Listen! Let me quickly go take a bath! Can you make me a strong coffee? Leave it, Roy! Go make some coffee! "Someone so close, without even knowing," "Coming to caress, without even saying," "Is it a mere story in my mind?" "Or are you the reality that overwhelms my heart?" 'Regarding the missing case of Rajagopal, the famous novelist,' 'the hints suggest that there has been' 'no significant progress in the investigation.' 'His son, the ex-MLA...' Hey, Once I'm here, I even turn my phone off! And you're watching TV? Have you read his novel? It's superb! "Someone so close, without even knowing," "Coming to caress, without even saying," "Is it a mere story in my mind?" "Or are you the reality that overwhelms my heart?" "For us, together," "To melt away on this land," "A zillion lifetimes will bloom!" 'Can you whisper in my ears, if this is a dream or reality?" "Is even the reality fading away like a dream?" "When the dusk arrives," "Let me be the charming moonlight on your window shades" "Within these walls, as a lit candle," "Let me yield you warmth." "Let me bloom as a dainty melody," "With your fingertips," "shower the lyrics on it." "Let me plant a kiss on the speck of your forehead," "Let me gently rest down on your lap." "For us, together," "To melt away on this land," "Will a zillion lifetimes bloom?" "Am I misreading between reality and dreams?" "Is even the reality fading away like a dream?" "When the days and nights extend together, here..." - "Isn't that Teena's house?" - "Yeah!" - "Nobody there?" "They... were there." "Don't cry, dear!" "Sir, one moment!" "Mom!" We daunt him and feed him by saying that police will come! That's why he's crying! Did they tell you where they went? Uhm... She was there. She had told that she would leave today. I don't know if he went to drop her. Yeah! There he is! I'm here to meet Teena. Couldn't reach her number. Well... She was on leave. She keeps the office phone off when she comes home. She has gone back today. You may reach her now. Ok! Well... what was it? You know the novelist, Rajagopal? Teena had posted a photo with him, on Facebook. It was on the previous day of his missing. I came here to enquire if Teena knows anything about it. Okay? See you. 'Don't cry! No!' 'Aww! Looks like you're sleepy!' 'Shall we go to sleep?' 'See! A cat!' 'The cat's gone! See! It'll come back now!' 'Looking for Teena...' Why are you crying? It's okay! - Stop crying! - Hey! Yes? When did the police arrive? You came, right? Just 5 minutes before that. Aww! Let's go! Come! Let's go to sleep! He has written only four books. But all of them are bestsellers. Have you read any, sir? I've read one, I think... My wife follows him quite well, though. She is a huge fan of him. That's what. Anyone who reads his books will become his fan! That day, I met him at the coffee shop unexpectedly. So I clicked a selfie, and posted it on Facebook. Apart from that, I don't know him personally. I'm recording your words as your statement. If you have anything more to say, or pass any information, - Please call me. - Sure, sir! Let's go! Do you know Rajagopal? Well! The police asked this and left just now! Well, if you could write a feature about his missing, it would be of great demand now. He's got health issues due to his age. The readers wish that he returns safely. Yet, you want this! Well... Vinu from the library told me that his books are out of stock, In that angle, there's a scope for a feature. That's all! Are we out of other topics, sir? Let's just leave this aside! Of course! How about your novel? Will we get to read it anytime soon? As if he'll buy and read it the moment it gets released! He's simply flattering you! Such people... Hey, Deepak! I just reached my desk. Yeah! Continue your work. Come here in the evening. I don't think I can, today. Got some pending work to do. It's okay. Call me then. How's your son now? He's coughing a bit too much. Gotta take him to a doctor tomorrow, if it doesn't get better. Okay! - 'Alright then. I'll call you later.' - Yeah. Okay. 'Just add it to the curry.' 'Don't burn the chilly too much. Turn it off!' - It isn't burnt, mom! - Burn it, then! Mom, Teena is here! I'll call you after dinner. Hey, Teena! Did you eat anything? Looks like she's gonna test her food on you! - Aren't you doing fine, aunty? - Of course! How's Roy? He's happy. He's good. Carry on with your things then. - Bye! - Bye! - Bye! Hey! Let me quickly go and take a bath! Okay? Uhm! So you're eating oats tonight, huh? No! A nice fish gravy and 'Pathiri'. Wow! Where did you get them? Nabeesumma got them for me. They know that you'd be gloomy without me, and won't cook anything! Well, there's something left in the fridge. That's why I didn't make anything. What did you have? Nothing yet. Soumya has prepared something. Wow! I'm having a slight headache. I may go to bed early. But... why headache? Nothing as such! Don't start worrying about it! I had my works pending, as I was on leave. It's because of looking at the screen for a long time. Uhm... Alright then. Go to sleep early. - Okay, sure. - Call me in the morning, okay? Oh, sure! Good night! Bye. Listen... I didn't get any appreciation for cleaning the whole house! Now if you tell me that the curry isn't good, I'll kill you! I sensed it when I entered the house! The smell was 'wonderful'! Really? Don't eat it, then! Give me! I was just kidding! Listen... Are you planning to sleep early? I've got an awesome movie! Shall we watch it? No, you watch it. I'm not in a mood. Oh, I forgot about that. Once you're back from home, you're always like this! Huh? Huh? I'm getting it! Stop it! Shall I tell you where the missing ones are? On the way from Vazhikkadavu to Nadukani, towards the left is Maruthapuzha. From there, on the way to Chinnathodu, after the checkpost, there's a big board with an elephant's picture on it, There's a route to the forest from there, towards the right. On that route, there's an old house. The missing ones are there. Hey, shall I tell you where the missing ones are? Yeah? On the way from Vazhikkadavu to Nadukani, towards the left is Maruthapuzha. 'From there, on the way to Chinnathodu,' there's a big board with an elephant's picture on it, There's a route to the forest from there, towards the right. On that route, there's an old house. The missing ones are there. Uhm... Roy must've dreamt about this. Take your medicine and go to sleep. Okay? Alright. Good night. Hi, chechi! Good morning! Good morning! The police were here yesterday to see Teena, I heard? It's about the novelist, isn't it? So? Tell me what it is, Tony! Nothing as such! A friend of mine, told me that he saw him in a bus to Vazhikkadavu. Which bus? Vazhikkadavu. Well... When did he see him, you said? Last Sunday, he said. There are buses to Vazhikkadavu from everywhere in Kerala. All he said is that he saw him on that bus. I don't know anything else, okay? Where all can we go from Vazhikkadavu? From there, Sulthan Bathery, And, well... If you get to Nadukani, from there, Goodalloor, Ooty, Mysore... It's a nice route. Haven't you gone there? Hey! Did you reach the office? Yeah! Well... I called you to ask something. What was your dream last night? Why? Nothing as such. You woke me up last night and said something. Names of some places... Yeah... A girl came near our window and said something. Well... Do you remember what she said? No, dear! 'It was you who asked me to take my pills and sleep.' I just woke up. Okay then. I'll call you later. Bye. 'Going on a journey, following a dream!' All credits to my husband! Hey! Why so early? Saw a status of yours in Facebook! Yeah! I thought of taking one week's leave. And the purpose is writing, isn't it? - Shall I join you? - No! I won't disturb you at all! I'll sit quietly! Well, did you decide your destination? That's a secret! Something's fishy! I know! Think of it that way! If I tell you now, you'll say that I'm nuts! I'd say that even if you don't tell me! Hey! I'm going then. I'll take you the next time, okay? And yes. My files and books... Don't even touch them! They're important! Why do I need them anyway? - Alright! Bye! - Bye! Hi! I saw your status! Why all of a sudden? You didn't tell me anything! Is it an official trip? No, it's personal. I thought of telling you. What's there to think so much? If I tell you this, you'll come with me. I can't join you now anyway. My son's fever has worsened. That's why I didn't tell you. Well... This is an uncertain trip. If it works out, it'll be beneficial for both of us. Anyway, I'll talk to you in detail once I'm back. Okay? Alright. Bye. It's your personal number. Where are you off to? Hey! Didn't you have a dream last night? From that, I got a hint about the places where Rajagopal sir could be at. I'm gonna carry out an investigation! You didn't have this fad for quite some time! Yeah! Isn't it been a while, Roy, that I went on a solo trip? I... I'm at the bus stop now. Oh, so you already started, huh? Well, How's your headache? That's all gone! Roy, the bus is about to start. I'm going. I will call you once I reach. Ok? Bye! But, where are you going? 'Vazhikkadavu' Were you able to reach her? No! She'd be at at some place with no network. It isn't that. Her phone is switched off. She'll call you! 'By God's will!' Sir? Remember journalist Teena, whom we met... regarding the missing case of novelist Rajagopal? Her husband Roy is here, he says she's also missing. - Missing? - Yes! Suresh told me that he met her when he went to her office. Yeah. What should I do, sir? Do this. - Ask him to come here. - Alright, sir. Hello! Hello! CI sir is calling you. Go to that room. Come. Have a seat. Your wife is working at Ernakulam, right? Why do you think she's missing? I've not been able to reach her phone since last evening. She's gone on a trip. You have anybody's number who is with her? She went alone. Did you enquire in her office, or with her friends? No use asking them. They don't know anything. You're just unable to reach her on phone, right? And it's not even 24 hours. Isn't it too early to conclude that she's missing? It's not that, sir. Something... has happened to her. I'm sure about that. Roy, right? Don't get tensed, Roy. She might be out of coverage area, or her phone might be damaged. That could be why she's not contacting you. It's not that, sir! You don't know. Whatever happens, she would contact me! Something has happened to her. Anyway, lodge a complaint with all these details. We'll enquire. Sir, look at this. This is Teena's Facebook post, from yesterday morning 11:22. She's let everyone know that she's going! Yes, sir! Well, in that novelist's missing case, ask Suresh what her statement was. And what about that land infringement case? - Haven't you asked Saji to come today? - We've sent people. He can't just come and blabber like the last time! No, sir! He's a bit snotty! I'm even snottier then! 'Complaint from Roy Jacob' I got an urgent meeting. Will see you after that. - Haven't you lodged the complaint? - Yes. - You gave her number, right? - Yeah. Your number too, right? Yeah. Then we will investigate and let you know if there's anything. Aren't you gonna investigate now, sir? Listen... There's a method of investigation for each case. You've given her number, right? We'll track her location through cyber department, and let you know. You may go now. Hasn't it been a week since Rajagopal went missing? You aren't able to find him yet! Will this also be like that? Teena went to him. How do you know that? It's me who told her the route. So, you know where Rajagopal is. Interesting! Couldn't you have told this first? We could've found both of them! Enquire thoroughly about his wife, and about him too. Ok, sir! If you find any link to the missing novelist, let me and Suresh know. Sure, sir. It's not his wife, he's the one who's missing! I gave her leave for a week. She said she has to complete her novel. But didn't she go on leave recently? Do you let people go on leave, so often? Not for everyone. Teena's language is good. Besides, her stories have got a good number of followers. So if you don't give her leave, she'd resign, isn't it? That's right! She goes on such trips quite often! Still, would she just go without telling anyone? You and her shared a good rapport, isn't it? Well... Not so much to mention about. Is there any problem, sir? Well, we've received a complaint that she's missing. She won't be missing, sir! She goes and comes as she wishes! I wouldn't be surprised if she comes in right now! 'Going on a journey, following a dream!' All credits to my husband! 'Yes, Suresh?' Asif sir! People here say that Teena often goes on such trips! Oh! Besides, who knows! She'd have some affair! Did you check the mobile tower location? When the phone got switched off, it was in Mayyanthani area. We're checking if she's got any friends there. Okay, Suresh. I'll call you in case of any updates. Alright. He'd get tensed if he can't reach Teena on phone. He's quite a caring person. Maybe he lodged the complaint because of that. Where's her family? - Family... - Well... Are you Teena's friend, or relative? I'm the daughter of her mom's cousin. Ever since she got married to Roy, she got disconnected from her family. Alfred uncle, her dad is in Germany. But he got married to someone else, and is settled there. - In Germany? - Yeah! Sir, Saji is not at home! Let's come back tomorrow again. Any update on Teena's case? Apart from Roy, nobody thinks that Teena is missing. Her friends say that she often goes on solo trips, and keeps her phone switched off. But, isn't it the first time we're receiving such a complaint? Yes, sir! Get into the vehicle. Did you enquire about her husband? He lives all alone in that house. Sometimes his wife comes on leave. Only then he gets out of the house. I heard that he doesn't have any close friends or relatives. Is this his native? It's his own house. He's from an inherently affluent family. He had a job earlier, somewhere far away. Something seems fishy. The people around say that he's got some disorder. Didn't I tell you? He's the one missing! Huh? Hasn't he left yet? Huh? I saw him leaving! Guess he came back. We enquired about your wife. It's likely that she went on her own will. Don't worry. She'll be back soon. Even if she doesn't, you don't care, isn't it? Why doesn't he believe when I say that Teena is in danger? Teena went in search of Rajagopal. I'm sure about it. When we questioned Teena, she said she isn't even acquainted with him. It's because he's an infirm person... Sir, I'll deal with this. I got you into this, hoping to get some link to the novelist case... This is the book Rajagopal gifted my wife, whom you said she isn't even acquainted with! See! 'To Teena. Thanks for writing the book I couldn't write.' It's not us who said that she isn't acquainted with Rajagopal. Teena herself said that. Why would Teena tell such a lie to the police? What if she has said many such lies, which you don't know about? Come. The way I see it, Teena is quite creative, She's pretty, and is active in social media, and she's quite younger than you, too. So, she might be having a lot of kinships. You two just don't match each other, as I see it. You don't have kids, too. You don't even stay together regularly. Right? What did she post in Facebook? 'All credits to my husband' What does that mean? 'My husband is responsible for all these' So if she left you on her own will, we can't do anything about it. Wasn't that a bit too much, sir? It was intentional. Until we find Rajagopal and that girl, let his name also be there in the suspect list. I felt he is a poor soul. It's because you are one. You didn't understand that 'all credits' part then. Let's see! It's alright. You're continuing the tablet for pressure, right? Doctor, last time we gave these medicines... - Did you check his BP? - Yeah, it's normal. Ok, continue these medicines then. One moment! Take them daily once only. At night. - Alright. See you. - See you. Let's go! Come! Did you notice the guy who was sitting in the corridor? Who? The guy reading a book. I felt something special about him. - The guy who was sitting on the side?- Yeah! Either I've seen him before. Or, I might see him again. Haven't you left his topic yet? Had you come a bit late, I would've found out all his details. Hey, have you heard of 'Déjà vu'? Isn't it the feeling that you've already seen something that's happening right now? I've heard about it. Hurry up with those veggies! It isn't something happened before. Something you've dreamt of before. When we see that in reality, it's Déjà vu. There's such an interpretation, too. Likewise, We might have met someone in our dreams, who is going to be very important in our lives. And when you see them in real life, you feel an instant connection, a spark, isn't it? You're talking about the guy who was at the hospital, right? Look! 'll smash your head with this! He doesn't look like someone, who would read English romantic novels. He doesn't even look like someone who would read a book! Hello? Hey, can you do me a favor? What's it? From your hospital, can you get me the details of the guy we saw the other day? You got nothing better to do? Can't you focus on your studies? Why troubling others? I'm studying to become a journalist, not a doctor! Get this clear, first! Ok, let me see. - I'll call you. - Okay, bye. - Bye! Brother, a strong coffee. Without sugar. Hey... His name is Roy Jacob. I've got his details. I got 2 files. One from the psychology department. It says that he's got some dream issues and he's a lucid dreamer... As it's from the psychology department, it is confidential, you know... I couldn't obtain much details. Then I got another file. Then I got another file. It's about a treatment he and his wife had, a few years ago. His sperm count is low. He can't have children. In short, he's a psycho-messed up case, whom even his wife left. Listen... Leave your 'Déjà vu' stuff aside! So my expectation wasn't wrong. No wonder why I felt a difference when I saw him. Let me go and do something that could be of use to someone! Ok? Hey... Did you let go of your 'Déjà vu'? You don't talk about it anymore! Can you guess where I spend all my time in the college? No need to guess it. Must be in the library. You never attend classes, right? He was working in the same library for 6 years! Oh! So you know each other since then? How could it be? He was terminated a year before I joined. Now I spend all my time in the same space he was at! I heard several stories about him from the college. It raised my curiosity. I got his phone number and talked to him. Told that I want to meet him. - Are you going to meet him? - Yeah! He has agreed to meet me at the park near our college. Is it? Awesome plan! Let me sleep then. Good night! The last hour was Parvathy miss' class, right? Didn't you attend it? Isn't it been a while since you left? You still remember the time-table? Well, you said you liked her class. Her class is superb. But, when did I tell you that? One tea, uh... One coffee, strong, without sugar. Let's sit there. The coffee you ordered, is that for me? Tell me the truth, Roy! Do you have any mind-reading skills? Didn't you order coffee yesterday? I thought you're diabetic! Oh, no! I'm not a diabetic! I love the bitterness of coffee. There's a sweetness even in that bitterness! Exactly! A famous writer said it about coffee. How did you see me ordering coffee yesterday? We're meeting for the first time today, isn't it? Isn't this the third time? Don't confuse me! How could that be? - First, hospital. - Okay. - Then, canteen. - Canteen? Were you at the canteen yesterday? I called you yesterday and planned to meet today, isn't it? Is that so? Maybe then, the meeting at the canteen was... a dream of mine! Oh! So, what else did you see in your dream? You were quite talkative. You didn't let me talk much. Stop bluffing! What else did I say? Well.. about your family, about your best friend, About me? Yeah! He's not a messed-up case as you said! He's a very interesting man! Really! You know that I've never been able to do mind-reading, no matter how hard I try? But he tells me all these with so much ease! Are you planning to meet him again and again? You got nothing else to do? Of course! How could I miss such a special specimen? Anyway, it's okay as his 'count' is low! You're safe! 'Don't close the doors to your eyes, o' the apple of my eye,' 'when you shine as the beam of my life!' 'like I saw you for ages with my eyes,' 'and saw your glimpses in my dreams!' You closed down your ancestral home, and is living here all alone. What's the reason behind that? I don't have many friends in my native place. So you got friends here? 'Blooming as petals, spilling as a sea,' 'we painted our days.' 'Searching like fingers, trembling on nudging,' 'our unspoken desires soared up.' 'When memories shine as tears in the eyes,' 'sweetness fills in me, while sinking into you' - Hey, shall I ask you something? - Yeah? Water... Air... Fire... Earth. Which one would you select? Why? I just wanna know, how romantic Roy is! - Water. - Water? Yes. Calm, when you look at it. But when you approach it, you realize its depth. The water is usually cold. But when heated, it rises as vapour. Soar up as clouds. Shower as rain. As rivers, waves... And, it can even turn into a tsunami! 'Don't close the doors to your eyes, o' the apple of my eye,' 'when you shine as the beam of my life!' 'Even before meeting, we met somewhere,' 'on some fantasy-era' 'I become an island that no one looked for,' 'are you showering on me as the mist?' 'We shall cross the dark woods,' 'I shall write myself as a dream on the book that's you' 'Don't close the doors to your eyes, o' the apple of my eye,' 'when you shine as the beam of my life!' Why are you staring like this? It's not a dream! Nobody else has barged into my life like you! People have always left me! I don't understand, why someone's wife would leave him, when he is so romantic! It's got nothing to do with romance. She left me when she couldn't tolerate me anymore. Are they photos? Listen... No need to struggle and read them all! I've got a... disorder. I've consulted several doctors, and these are those files. Even they haven't been able to... diagnose it correctly. But I'm clear about it. My dreams, reality, imagination, they're all mixed up, and are stored in a jumbled form, in my mind. It's quite difficult to differentiate between them! But, isn't that awesome? Not as awesome as you think! Suppose what happened between us last night was a dream, what'd happen if I behave with the same freedom, the next time we meet? Wouldn't our relation end that very moment? Get ready. I'll get you a coffee. My condition is not as simple as you think. It's very difficult for me to mingle with others, in my daily life. It could get so unbearable for others. That's why I decided to live alone. No matter how hard I try, sometimes I lose it. And I become a mentally ill man in front of others. One life is all we've got. What's the point in living it the way everyone else does? You two are the strangest people I've ever met. I've always felt that she is even crazier. You are used to living alone. You should keep in mind that she got all alone, only for you. But these cops don't understand it! Aren't you ashamed to feel dejected, listening to some random cops? Don't let her know about all these. You would understand, but... how do I make others understand? Roy! Come out of your complexes first! She used to always tell me there's some truth in, your dreams and intuitions! That's the reason why she went looking for that novelist! No matter how hard I try, I'm unable to recollect the place names I told Teena that night! It's your sole responsibility to find Teena without any harm! You can challenge those people who don't understand your relation, and find Teena without anybody's help! Only you can do it, Roy! The bond that I and Teena share can't be measured with your police brain! I'm sure that she won't leave me! I wanted to come and tell you this. That's why I came right now. Otherwise, I won't be able to sleep! You don't believe what I said, right? I'll search and find Teena! I thought she went on a casual trip, when I commented on the post. As it is Roy who lodged the complaint, don't take it lightly. I know them personally for many years. Their emotional bond is at a level nobody can guess. - Inquest Deepak in person. - Okay, sir. - Isn't he the guy with a publishing house and a coffee shop? - Yeah! Ask Suresh, if Teena and Rajagopal met in that coffee shop. Okay. Sure. Hello! Isn't Deepak here? No, sir. He's gone out. Why, sir? Oh! Okay! Teena spend more time in this office, than with me. It's been 2 days since Teena went missing. We will enquire. Relax, Roy. Teena would call you anytime from now. I'm sure about it. Her phone is switched off since last two days. The last time she called, she said that she's going to meet the novelist. You got any info about it? Listen... 'SI Suresh, Ernakulam' called you twice. Well... Keep it there. - Okay. - I'll call him back after this. Yes, sir. Sir, as you thought, that photo was clicked at Deepak's shop. I too feel that these two missing cases are connected. Once one gets resolved, the other one too should. I'll get in touch with all other friends of Teena. Let's see if we get any info. Rajagopal and Teena are close friends, and they are writers, too. And both of them are missing now. Is there any connection between these two? What do you think, Deepak? Well... that... I mean... Well... Why did Teena lie to the cops that she isn't acquainted with Rajagopal? Are you acquainted with Rajagopal? He is Teena's friend. I've read his books, too. That's all I know about him. One moment. Hello? Please hold for a moment. Yes, tell me. Hey, listen. I had told Teena that, Rajagopal was seen in a bus to Vazhikadavu. I think she took it a bit seriously. She took leave and left the same day. What if Teena went looking for Rajagopal sir? That's what I feel. Her husband came here and made a fuss about it. He also kept saying this same thing. In that case, let me enquire. He is here with me, now. Nothing to worry, right? 'No!' - Alright! - I'll call you later. 'Selvi by Rajagopal' 'To Deepak, with love. Rajagopal' Teena introduced me to Rajagopal sir. The novel that Teena is writing now, is based on Rajagopal sir's life. We were about to launch her book through my publishing company, next month. It was then that Rajagopal sir went missing, and all these problems started... We had signed a contract with Rajagopal sir, that nobody will get to know about this, until the book releases. Maybe that's why, Teena lied to the cops that she doesn't know him well. Teena strongly wished to settle down with you, as early as possible. And I'm in debt due to the loan I took for starting this company. It was the necessity of Teena and I, to release that book soon. ['Let it be' by The Beatles] 'When I find myself in times of trouble,' 'Mother Mary comes to me,' 'Speaking words of wisdom, let it be' 'And in my hour of darkness,' 'she is standing right in front of me' 'Speaking words of wisdom, let it be' 'Let it be, let it be,' 'let it be,' 'let it be' How do you find it till now? Liked it? It's good! It's very interesting that you fictionalized it. So I was right. It's a hit! Why don't you finish it quickly, then? Isn't that why I went in search of him? You didn't tell me that this was the purpose. Well... I thought of letting it be a surprise for you. Surprise! Why do you keep your phone switched off? Isn't that why I get worried? I had lost my phone. Someone pushed me from behind, while at the forest. I was about to come to you. I got some info to share. I have some documents, related to the life of Rajagopal. The school in which he studied, his friends, the places he visited, the awards he received, all such things. Here! So this is how Teena and Rajagopal are connected. Teena's been writing a book based on the life of Rajagopal. It was about to be published through Deepak's company, soon. Why is such a great novelist's life story being written so secretly? As someone who's in touch with huge publishing houses, why would he publish it through Deepak's small company? So, he's got some secrets to reveal, through this book. And when the novel was almost finished, both of them went missing. Somebody who doesn't want these secrets to be revealed, is behind this. Who? It's not my job to investigate it. It's the job of the police! Rather than wandering around in my backyard, please investigate this. The lives of two people are in danger. Get out of your dreams, and turn on the TV. Rajagopal was found last evening. Things are not as you think. Rajagopal went looking for some relative. Somebody informed his family, when he was found lost and worn out. He's admitted in the hospital now. Hasn't it been 3 days since your wife left? No info about her yet. That means, as I said, she went on her own will. And if at all there's somebody behind all these, I'll get hold of him! What was the reason for Rajagopal sir to go like this, now? He's been facing old age issues for quite some time, So we don't let him go anywhere alone, usually. Was he trying to write anything new, lately? Heard such a news. He had expressed such a desire, But his health issues are a big factor... How's his health now? Is there any hope? What are you hoping for, actually? His life was as mysterious as his novels. The last book he wrote was 'Selvi', in 1995. When asked about if he'd continue writing, his answer was that 'one more book will be released.' Despite his fans waiting for over 20 years, he wasn't ready to write, yet. - Soumya! - Yeah! I don't think you'd be able to see him. The media and cops are also not allowed. He's under the control of his family now. If we could meet his relatives, to get any info. Even the media with the same request was asked to leave. Besides, his condition is a bit serious. He might be moved to the ventilator soon. Well, if we wait for some time, would it help? You may leave now. I'll call you. Okay. I'll call Suresh and get the investigation report of Rajagopal. We'll get an idea about the places Rajagopal visited. Good. If Teena went in search of Rajagopal, she'd be somewhere there. Yeah. Right! Hearing the news of his return, chances are that she may return! But... Isn't her phone switched off since last 3 days? Looking at it that way, What if there's some truth in Roy's words? Tell me clearly. What if somebody kidnapped Rajagopal? What if they attacked, silenced and left him there? I understand your angle. If so, Teena would be under the custody of those who harmed him. Right! As long as Teena can't come out, this novel too won't. Right, sir! Yeah! How did it go? Saji is still in Chennai, his wife says. Would we have to go to Chennai now? No, sir. We will consider this seriously. - It's better if you follow up. - Sure, sir. - You may get into the vehicle. - Sir! But then, couldn't they just finish them off? Maybe all they want is to stop that book's release! You read a lot of thrillers, right? I watch such movies, sir! Well! Let's go! Hi! Aren't you Teena's husband? I'm a relative of writer Rajagopal. I'm the one who stays with him in the hospital. He's been making a fuss about getting you there, right now! Wanted to discuss something important, he said. In the morning, the place would be crowded. Well... can he speak? The TV reports said that he's in the ventilator. It's all just a sham! He'll be killed the moment they know that he can speak! That's why he lies down silently. Why so? If he starts speaking, he'll shout out everything! Whatever they did back then! As he feels guilty now! Hey... Don't go that way. There's a security guard. There's an ATM. Let's go that way, without anyone noticing. That way. Get in. This is my condition now. I can't speak to anyone. Please ask Teena to... finish writing that novel somehow. Who's that? Stay right there. Hello! Yes? I told the police about last night, and they've gone inside. What? Last night... Sorry, I think you got the wrong person. He isn't reacting to medicines. There's multiple organ damage, too. He wasn't eating or drinking for more than a week, right? Yeah.. Okay. Any chances of him to speak? No. We're trying to extend his life somehow. Okay! Let's go! Okay. Why are you so irresponsible? - Sir! - Will call you! Sir, let me get the vehicle! Sir! Teena's phone is ringing, sir. Please try, sir. Get into the vehicle, you! It was ringing, sir! Okay. Sir, it was really ringing. Don't you dare say a word! You should get admitted to a hospital, if you're mentally ill! You should be put behind the bars for cooking up stories against such a famous novelist! We should be blamed for listening to his words and coming all the way here! Drive towards that secluded road. Yeah. You can say whatever, sir! But, hadn't I lodged a complaint? Did you investigate? Where is Teena? What crosses my mind is something else! I wonder how she managed to live with you all these days! Such cases should be closed, stating that she just left her husband. Enough, sir! You've said this before, too. I went to his house the other night, and gave a nasty reply. So, he is a bit annoyed with me because of that. You're not able to find Teena because it's still in his mind. What are you talking about? You can't just enter the flat where he lives. There are security guards. Without his permission, nobody can enter that place. He's been scolding you because you babble such things! Come on. Hop in. You may take your car and go home. I gotta go to the station. And... Eventhough sir just keeps saying whatever he feels, he's a very capable officer. I know that my disorder can cause difficulties and confusion to others. But... To tell me what's real and what's not, all I have is my Teena. In the eyes of others, I may be mentally ill. Do you remember him hurting my feelings, at the police station? By mentioning that Teena just left me? What if, I believe it and imagine or dream about it? My brain would then tell myself, that it's the truth! Luckily I met Teena's friend Aswathy on the road. She is the only one who knows the depth of our relationship. With the motivation that she gave me, I went ahead and started investigating it. But now... No matter whether you close this case or not, I gotta find my Teena, right? Hello, doctor? I'm Asif, who's investigating Teena's case. Yeah. Tell me. You got any info? Not yet. Where are you now? You said you were in Delhi, right? Did you come here recently? No, I'm still in Delhi. What happened? Well... Nothing, doctor. I'll call you later. Thank you. Okay. Yeah. Sir! They had called from the cyber cell, twice. Asked you to call them back urgently. I'll call them. Sir, Teena's number was switched on for some time, this afternoon. - No calls were made, though. - Is it? - Yeah. Did you trace the location? It's a forest area near Tamilnadu border. Chinnathodu. Whatsapp me the location immediately. - Okay? - Okay, sir! Yes, sir! Hello? Brother? Yes, Deepak. Don't expect anything from the police now. They say that Teena just left me. D.. Deepak... Listen to me carefully, and trust my words. I'm sure that Teena is inside the forest. She told me that she lost her phone there. Even he told me the same, at the hospital. Not just that, It's written in Teena's book that he and his friends go hiking in the forest. Well... Brother... I've reached Vazhikkadavu now. Tracing Rajagopal sir's route, and Teena's last tower location, I came here. Now, as you said, it is a forest area from here. Yeah... Can you tell me your location? I'll come there. There's a guesthouse of a friend of mine. I'll give you the address. And, They don't let the cars in, after 6PM. You may come tomorrow morning. I'll be here. Hello? Hello? Brother? Hello? 'Shall I tell you where the missing ones are?' [Indistinct instructions] Chandran! Yes, sir! Have you seen this person? Who's it? It's a missing case, from town. She... I was about to call you. Just a moment. Sir! Chirutha got this from the forest. She gave it to me when I was on rounds. Thought of giving it to you when I come to town. It was switched off when I got it. When I woke up, I turned it on once. And when a call came, I turned it off Hello? Sir! Teena's phone is in Chinnathodu station. We'll have to issue a search order for at least 3km around that tower location. - I'll get it done. - Okay, sir! Pass this info to all stations on that route. Sure, sir. As Roy said, I sense a threat to her. Did you call and inform him? No, sir. As we didn't get a clear picture... What if the clear picture is disastrous? He's the complainant, too! Call him and inform this right now! Hello? It's me, SI Asif. Please come to the station at 10AM. Got an info to share. Wanted to discuss it in person. Sir, I'm on the way to Chinnathodu. Chinnathodu? Yes. Teena is in some forest nearby there. How do you know that? Hello? Sir, he is on the way to Chinnathodu, he says! How did he get to know that location? That's what even I'm wondering. When we got into the right path, is he playing a different trick now? How did you come here? In my car. Let me get ready. - Let's reach Chinnathodu as quick as possible. - Okay, sir. - Isn't this SI Manikandan? - Yes! - I'm the CI. Tell me, sir. We don't know what the situation would be. The ambulance and medical team should be ready. Sure, sir. We're already here. Sir, don't we have to inform the checkpost? I'll call them. Yeah. Yes, sir. What was the color of the car? A green one? Yeah. A light green... - well... Padmini. - Number? 8585. Right? Yes, sir. Yeah. Shall we block him, sir? Yeah, stop him for just a while. - We'll reach by then. - Alright, sir. Let him go only when we ask you to. Okay, sir. 'Chinnathodu' Ask SI Manikandan to come here. I've shared the live location, sir. Are SI Manikandan and team here? Yes, sir. They're here. Yeah. Please go search in there. Okay, sir! Hey! Look inside these rooms! Sir, a room is locked here. Just force it open! Check if she's breathing! Ask them to get the stretcher! Hey! Where are you going? Move aside! Take him away! - Come here! - Entering a crime scene and... T.. there... Move the hands. - Sir, it's Teena! - Move her away from the dirt. Hasn't the stretcher arrived yet? Ask them to hurry up! Come on! Hurry! Go! Go! Place her on it. Keep the hand properly. Okay! Careful! Slowly! You didn't expect us here, did you? When did you dump her here? Rajagopal and his friends killed and buried someone here, years back! All these are happening so that this news doesn't go out! How many times did I tell you, that Teena's life is in danger? - Get the complete history of this house. - Sir! Who owned this place, who is the current owner... Okay, sir. And the forest guard who got her phone, - Yeah. - Question him, too. Ok. We should know if anybody used to visit here. Ok. Only once we know the details and history of Rajagopal and his friends, we can assure if Roy has a point or not. Ok. If any of them are connected to this forest or house in anyway, gotta find that, too. Why did Teena come to this forest? How did Roy spot it correctly? Anyway, get her statement once she's conscious. Ok, sir. - And follow it up correctly. - Sure. Okay, thank you! Teena! Aren't you okay? You got any difficulty in speaking? The police officers are here. They want to meet you. Okay? Teena? On the other day, you said you didn't know Rajagopal personally. The book that I'm writing is based on his life. I had an agreement that I'd keep it a secret. Why did you go inside the forest? I was hoping to find Rajagopal sir and complete my book. What happened inside the forest? I felt like somebody was following me. Somebody pushed me down from behind. When I regained consciousness, I was in that house. Oh... Was your book revealing any secrets related to Rajagopal's life? As per his words, such things are there. But he didn't tell me what they are. So I don't know. These are hard to believe. Did the doctor say anything else? No, sir. There's been no sign of physical abuse, or attempt to it. She's worn out due to not eating for all these days. She'll get discharged today, or tomorrow. Roy's tower location didn't change, unlike you suspected. On those days, he was at home itself. The neighbors too confirmed it. SI Manikandan sir had called. The forest guard doesn't know anything in particular. And he says it's a haunted house! Did you check the owner of the house? The legal papers, history, such things? Somebody encroached that land and built it. The department recaptured it later. Manikandan sir and forest department are investigating it. There's another info. The college in which Rajagopal studied, It is just 15KM away from this forest. And... The tales we heard about him weren't quite decent! So, you suggest that, we should take Roy's words into account, and investigate the case? Why do we have to investigate it, sir? The missing ones are back. And about the house, let the police from that area investigate it. But yet, what if Roy's words are true? There is a villain in this case. The one who shut Rajagopal quiet, and the one who locked Teena up. You do this. Get me all the details related to both these cases. Alright. And Asif, Get me the phone numbers of everyone involved in this. Let me see. Okay. Deepak had called. Rajagopal sir... There's no hope left for his recovery, he said. If you're gonna tell me about going back to your job immediately, I don't wanna hear it. I resigned from my job. I'm not going back there. It isn't a dream, Roy! I've decided to complete that book. Deepak has informed the media about this. Whatever I wrote till now... was based on what Rajagopal sir told me. I'll continue writing with what Roy told me. Until I finish writing it, can you be with me? Let me go check. I'm CI Ajith. I was there at the location that day. How's your health now? Alright. It's fine. Heard that your book is getting released. So are you done with writing? The last portions are in progress. We gotta release the book as early as possible. Your statement says that, Rajagopal didn't tell you anything about the final portions. And you went there, looking for it. Then, how will you complete it? Teena... you were assaulted, and Rajagopal was put in this condition. There's someone behind this. Don't you have any desire to bring them before the law? I intend to do that also, by publishing this book. In that case, you know what it is! Why don't you share it with us then? See... Roy is the one who told me all these. How can I share them as authentic statements then? And then, as it is my book, I have the freedom to write whatever I want. What Roy told me is that, Rajagopal and his friends killed and buried someone in that house. In that case, are the co-convicts behind all these? Anyway, it'll all be in the book, right? Let the book get released then. If its contents are true, whoever's hiding now will come out! If not, we will get them out! You know that the college where Rajagopal studied is near that forest, right? - Yeah. - I had inquired about it. We've got a report of the people who went missing during those years. Around 18 missing cases were registered in that area back then. In 15 cases, people either returned, or convicts were arrested and the cases closed. In the remaining 3 cases, we haven't got any hints yet. These are the copies of those case files. Means, The one who was killed and buried by Rajagopal and friends, is someone from these files. There is a chance. What she told me that day was, the trail to find herself. Shall I tell you where the missing ones are?
