- Tea girl, will you come out with that before I burst me bladder? - Hey, keep quiet, or you'll wake him up. - It wouldn't kill His Royal Highness to get up at a Christian hour. - You'd think he was the bloody King of England the way you worry about him. - Oh, calm down, will you? Turn that thing off. You'll want to hurry up now, you'll be late. - Oh. Eye on that bike before you go. Or I do. - Oh, you've not gone yet. You'd be late for your own funeral. - No, it's not our turn until next week. Hey, Mother, would you ever let us out? - All right, have you got the bike then? - Yes, I've got it. Thanks. Bye, Mom. - Bye bye now, Love, mind yourself. - Bye, Mom! - God bless! We already know. - All right, I will! Aye lad, give us one of them, would ya? Thank ya. Good morning, Mrs. Riley, how are ya? - Good morning, Mrs. Fortune. - Dublin's horses must go. In a shock announcement, Seamus O'Riordan, Minister of Transport and Power, today condemned Dublin's famous delivery horses as "relics of the dead past". Quackser. Quackser! Quackser! How do you want your eggs? Boiled or fried? - Fried! - You all right? - Yeah. - You sure you're all right? - Yeah, I feel much better now. - I don't know why you don't get a normal job like the rest of them. - Come on, Bess, off we go. - Hello, Quackser. Would you like a cup of tea? - Oh, no thanks. I just had a pot full. - Hey, would you ever put some of that stuff on me flowers? Poor plants are dying. - Oh, do you need some? Yeah, yeah, of course. - That's grand. Ah, you're a grand feller, Quackser. - I know it. And you have a grand garden. - Let's see now. Right enough. There you are. - Thanks very much. - You're welcome. - Sorry! - I'll show you! - You're lucky you're not killed on the street. All these damn lorries and cars all over the place. - You're a dying profession, Quackser. - Well, I'll tell ya, Paddy, as long as there's one horse left, I'll work me own business. Isn't that right, Bess? Horse manure! Fresh dung! Horse manure! - Excuse me. Hey, do you really sell that? - Yeah. - Really? - Yeah, it's me job. - Your job? - Yeah. Fresh dung! - I wish ol' Rex would oblige, but he's never on schedule. - Here's horse manure! - Who buys it? - Anyone. - Mind if I ask your name? - What you want to know my name for? - I just do. - Quackser. - What? - Quackser. - Quackser? - That's it, that's it. - Quackser what? - Fortune. - Is that an Irish name? - Which? - Quackser. - No, no, that's what they call me. I used to make noises like a duck when I was a baby. Fresh dung! Here's horse manure! - I've never heard of anyone being named after a duck. - What's wrong with a duck? - Nothing's wrong with a duck. - Me real name is Aloysius. - I think I like Quackser better. - So do I. Fresh dung! - I want to apologize for the other day. - Apologize for what? - For nearly ruining your cart. - Was that you? - I'm afraid it was, I'm sorry. Gotta go. Bye, Quackser. - Listen, Miss Fancy Horse Rider! The next time you won't escape so easy, I'm tellin' ya! Did you know that my real name was Aloysius? - Lovely. Another cup of tea? - No, no, I'm fine. - Didn't you think it was going to pour buckets just a few minutes ago? Now it's fine as can be. - Yeah. I thought sure it would be pouring buckets by now. - Would you like a little brown soda bread? It's in the oven. - Oh, no, no, I'm fine. - Are you sure you don't want a sweet? I've got a bit of cake put away for ya. - I couldn't, thanks very much. I couldn't eat another crumb. - Did you notice I tried that new raspberry jam you said your sister brought home last Friday. - It was good, it was good. But if you ask me, I like the marmalade better. The berry stuff is a little sweet. - Hm, I think you're right. How's your father? Has he got over that steam blast yet? - Oh yeah. It only took him a day to recover. He was wearing his winter togs. - Well, thank God for that. You know, it could've been serious. - Yeah. - Do you like me tea blend, Quackser? - I do, I do, I love it. - It wasn't too strong this time, was it? - No, no. It was good. - You don't think I made it too strong? - No, it was fine, Betsy, it was fine. - Ah, thank goodness. You know, I was afraid I put a bit too much of the Turkish blend in it. - Well, let's put it this way. It's the kind of stuff you don't fall asleep on, but it was good, Betsy. It was good. - Hello, Quackser. I was hoping you'd come along here. - What for? - Do I have to have a reason? Can I walk with you? - Now, what you want to walk with me for? - I just do. May I? - You win. But I'm working, mind ya. - Hey! Where we going? - Lunchtime! Watch yourself. - You come here for lunch very often? - Oh, well, I go around, but this is me favorite place. - Do you rate "Gulliver's Travel"? - Gulliver's what? - Travel. - Ah, no. No. - Well, Jonathan Swift, who wrote "Gulliver's Travels" was the Dean of St. Patrick's before he went to London. Didn't you know that you live in one of the most interesting cities in the world? - Who said I didn't know? - And Handel's Messiah had its world premier here. - Handels did? I didn't know that. You know a lot, don't you? I've lived in Dublin all my life. I never heard so much stuff about the place. - Well, you don't have to know about it, you're living here. - I was going to ask... - Yes? - I love crusts on bed, don't you? - Well goodbye, Quackser. - You're going? - I think I should. - Did I say something wrong? - No. - Then what are you going so fast for? Would you like a bite? - Thank you. - Why don't you come up to Carvener's with me for a drink? That's what I was going to ask you. - Okay. Sure, okay. - You will? - Sure. - That's it. I never work past one o'clock. Uh, would you like a ride? - In that? - Wait a minute. Stand up there. Stand up here. - Okay. Here. I'll just tread this over. That's it, wait a minute. Now sit down here. Careful now. Now put your feet on the side, that's it. Now hold on here. Are you all set? - Yep. - All right, come on Bess, let's go. - Oh! - But see, she had the horse in the bloody cart. - Forced me out with the dog. - Hello. Tim. Hello, Mike. Tom. You can sit down here. Don't worry. - There's a ladies lounge, Quackser. - Oh. Through there. Cut it out. - How's Betsy, Quackser? - She's fine. That new horseshoe did the trick. - Good her shoveled her up, no Irish horse did that. - And he didn't win hard at the racetrack. - What are you having, Quackser? - Uh, two large bottles. - Two large bottles. What's the woman drinking? - What? - What's she going to have? - One of them. - It's an awful occupation. - What is? - Syrup, and smelling that stuff. - Thank you. Well, here's to an unusual man with an unusual job. - Who's that? - That's you! - Me? Oh, I'll drink to that. - Yeah! - Quackser, Maguide would like your permission to talk to the lady. - Yeah, keep your seats please. I don't mind standing. - This is Maguire. - Hello. - Madam, if you don't mind me saying so, you've got a great pair of shoes. - Well, thank you very much. - Not at all, not at all. - How's Betsy, Quackser? - Fine. I said she was fine. - I've been in the business 30 years myself, and those are the finest... Would you mind if I took a closer look? - No, go ahead. - Them's patented leather, isn't that it, Maguire? - I believe they're alligator. - Madam, crocodile skin. - Oh, he knows his leather, Quackser. - Coming in the door, I looked at your feet, and I thought of the wife. - You like feet, don't you, Tom? - Me wife would cry if she could just touch them. - She loves shoes, Mrs. Maguire. - Ah, that is a beautiful bit of workmanship. - Well, I tell ya, Tom. Take a last good look, and keep a picture of them in your mind. - How's Betsy, Quackser? - Fine, she's fine. Thanks for asking. - Oh, give Quackser and the young lady a drink on me, Tim. And don't look like the other fellas either, Tim. - He hasn't got a penny. - Oh, a great pair of shoes. - Yeah, they're lovely, I noticed them meself. - Justice couldn't be done to a better pair of feet. - Ah. When I was a kid, they used to have horses drawing the milk from my hometown in America. - America? - Yes. Hartford, Connecticut. - Oh, yeah. Conneto... Connecticut. - Do you know Connecticut? - No, but I have a cousin in the Bronx. Would I like it in America? Me ma says I would. She says the Bronx is a grand place. - I don't know, I've never been to the Bronx. - You've never been to the Bronx? Come all the way from Connecticut to Dublin. What for? - To study at Trinity. - Does it cost much? - Yeah, it costs quite a bit. - Have you learned anything yet? - Well... Did you know that Dublin is a Danish name? It means "Black River". - How much did they charge you for that? We're at me house now. - Hey, Quackser. Where did you pick up the bit of stuff? - Quackser! - That's me ma. - Quackser, where the hell were ya? - I took another way! - Well, bye bye now, Mrs-- - Come on, you can meet me ma. Ma? Where'd she go? Why don't you sit down? I want you to meet somebody. - Will you come here a minute, Quackser? Why do you have to do it now? - You reckon-- - Why didn't you tell me you had visitors on your mind? Have you gone mad or what? - I'm not mad. - Going around in this day and age in her bare feet. - She must be very poor. It's a long story, Ma. - Yeah, I'm sure it is. Would you like a cup of tea? - Oh, thank you very much. - Thanks, Ma. - Does she wear those pajamas in the daytime? - She's from America. - Oh, I shoulda known. - You don't have to bother. - It's nothing, I don't mind. - Quackser! Here, take this. Hey, hey! This isn't for you. - I wouldn't drink from that. - Oh take it in and don't break anything. - Don't panic, Ma. Here we are. - Quackser, my name is Zazel. - What? - I hope you don't mind margarine, I'm afraid I ran out of butter. - No, that's lovely, thank you. My name is Zazel. - Oh, Zazel's from America. - America? - Isn't that right, Zazel? - Is that so now? Won't you sit down? - Thank you. - Here, Ma. - What's the horse plight like over there? We have a cousin in the Bronx, but he never writes a word about us. - In Connecticut? Well-- - Did you know that Dublin means "Black River" in Danish, Ma? - Have the horses stopped running out? - Not at the racetracks. They're still extremely popular there. - Sugar? - Yes please, two. - But you don't have the horses bringing round the grub? - No, not really. - On holidays, I suppose? - No, I'm at university, I'm doing research at Trinity. - Research? I wonder now if you could ever research me son's head for him. He seems to be blind to everything that passes him on the street. - You wouldn't believe the things I heard about Dublin today. - No, I'm sure I wouldn't. - Tell her, Zazel, go on. - I'm sure your mother's not interested in our conversation. - No, no, she would be. Go on, tell her. - Would you leave the girl alone, Quackser? - Tell her, she would, go on. - Well, I told Quackser that Queen Victoria loved the furnishings in Dublin Castle. - Well, it's easy enough to love something when it doesn't belong to you. - Would you like a cigarette? - No, no thanks, I never touch them. - Quackser? - Oh. Thanks very much. - What? - I told Zazel thanks very much for the cigarette. You know... Oh, thanks. I don't know how many times I passed these places we've seen today, and I never knew a damn thing about who lived where or did what. - You go filling his head with all them details you'll give him a headache. - Mm, it's good for me to know. - You can hardly read or write, what good will it do ya? Or you'll put your brain out to Dundrum. - What's Dundrum? - It's where they put you when you get light in the head. - I'm not that far yet. Here. - Oh, no. - No, no, I want you to keep it. - But Quackser, you spent half your day walking around Dublin after horses-- - And you gave away your shoes to Maguire's wife. Goodbye! - Bye! - Write me a letter! - Okay, I will. No, I don't have to! I'll be at Trinity for a while. - Then I'll see you again? - Yes, the Ambassador's Cinema on Tuesday at eight o'clock, okay? - Eight o'clock? - Yes! - Eight o'clock? Oh! - Where's Quackser? - Hello, Da. - Keep the cart away from the door before I break me leg sometime. - Ah, the expression. Do you want to see? - I don't think so, not tonight. The water's already there, dear. - Oh, thanks, honey, thanks indeed. You know, not for nothing, he think he's finally got money to himself, and got a decent job. Thought of helping the family or something. They're both gonna be messing about with that old horse manure. He knows bloody well there's a place for him in the foundry anytime he wants to pop him. - God, if he had the nerve, he could sing it. - No, no, that's not good enough for Prince Quackser. - Would you leave him alone? He's going out tonight to enjoy himself. What are you looking for? - Nothing. - Well, I'm sorry I spoke. - Where's the comb? - The what? - The comb, the comb! - What do you want the comb for? - Kathleen, lend us yours. - No, you're not going to use-- - Will you give me your comb? - No. - Jesus! Give me a comb, somebody! - Why don't you use your bloody shovel? - Another thing, Mother. Why can't he use the word fertilizer instead of always saying manure? It's embarrassing in the street. - Would you leave well enough alone? It's after taking me five years to get him to use the word manure. - Oh, listen, would you put that down, let's have a look at the television! - I want to borrow your tie, Dad. - Me tie? For what? - For my neck. - Well, all right. But now be careful with it. I have to have something to hold me trousers up when I go to work in the morning. - He didn't even wash his hair. - Where you going anyway? - I have something to do. - My God, it's dreadful. - Must be love. - Listen, Quackser. - What's up? - I hope she's worth it. - Give me the booking! Here's horse manure! Give me the booking! Fresh dung. Hello, hello. - Hello, where have you been? I've been looking all over. - You have? - Yes. - Oh, I'm sorry. You've been driving around in that? - Yes. You like it? - No. - Quackser. - You're the driver. - I'm sorry. Don't be angry, I apologize for last night. - Which night? Oh that, that's nothing, don't worry about that. - Do you want to come for a drive in the mountains? - What for? - Because I borrowed the car especially. - Oh yeah? - Don't you like it up there? - I don't know, I never been. - Never? - No, never. - It's fantastic out on the open roads. - Mm. - Well, do you want to come or don't you? - Oh, I don't think so. - Why not? - 'Cause I'd rather not go with you. - Okay. - What are you doing here? - I was looking for the library. - I'm glad you're here. I'm delighted, really, I am. - You are? You still want to drive to the mountains? Do you? It's supposed to be fantastic on the open roads. - I gave the car back. - We could take the bus. - All right, I'll try and borrow it. Wait for me. - Where you going? - Be right back. - I brought you some flowers. - Thank you. - That's heather. - It's very lovely. - Yeah. It's a very common flower. - Why don't you come around and sit down? - Um... Whoa. - Right here. - Oh, it's a terrific view. - It's nice. - Will ye go, Lassie go, and we'll all go together. To pluck wild mountain thyme, all around the blooming heather. I learned that in school. Where have they gone? - Who? - The horses? - Down to the splinter dock like the rest of them. - What for? - Oh, they ship them out from there, to the slaughterhouse. - And then they'll be killed and gone? - Well, you've said it. Dog food, or glue. - Ma! Ma! - What's up with ya? - Ma! - What in God's name is the matter with ya? - Did you know about the horses? - What, where? - The horses, all of 'em. - Which horses? - Delivery. Horses, they're putting a stop to it. - They've stopped up what? - Delivering! They'll be no more horses delivering. No more manure. The dung will be all gone. Ma. The horses. - I made you a cup of tea. - A cup of tea? The horses are leaving. - I knew the horses would go, but so did you. We kept telling ya. - What's in here? - The news of it. It was first in there over a month ago. That's last month's, that's yesterdays. Go on, read it. - Help me, Ma. - All right, Son, I'll read it for ya. The Department of Transport and Power announced plans to switch over to the faster and more modern mean, the motor driven engine beginning Thursday morning, the 21st of may. - That's next Thursday. - That's the end of the horses, Quackser. You can always go to your Cousin John in America. ♪ As I was thrown along the road ♪ ♪ At home when I was walking ♪ I heard that we left behind ♪ Didn't you hear, less we're talking ♪ - Hi, thank you. - They're taking the horses off the street. - What? - They're taking the horses away. - All of them? - Yeah. - Listen, meet me across the street from Trinity outside the front gate, okay? - Across the street? - Yeah. ♪ As I was going along the road ♪ ♪ At home, when I was talking ♪ I heard that we left behind ♪ Didn't you hear, less we're talking ♪ - Well, what's so important? - Where have you been? - Don't be upset. - I've been standing here waiting for ya. All the horses are going. Did you happen to hear me say that over all the singing? - Is that true, are they really? - Yeah, I'm standing here telling ya. - Well, I'm very sorry, but what do you want me to do about it? - You silly bitch. You don't even really care. - God damn you, Quackser, there are a certain amount of manners that I expect from a man. - Manners? Oh, manners me arse! I don't want any posh and polish. I want to talk to you. - Apparently, Quackser. Apparently you don't quite understand. - I don't want any attitude from you. I didn't come here for answers. - Don't be so stupid, Quackser! - I'm not stupid. - Well, you're acting very stupid. - Now, shut up. - Listen to me, Quackser. - Now shut up and don't talk to me that way. You talk to any other fella that way-- - Get your hands off me. - Now I wanted to talk to you. - Quackser, you are hurting me. - Now, I got something on my mind, and I want to talk to you. Now listen to me. - I have nothing to say to you, Quackser. - Will you just listen to me? - Oh, it was foolish in the first place, the whole thing. Quackser. Quackser, please I didn't... I'm sorry. - Maybe I don't have the right kind of job. - Now don't say that. I don't think of you that way. - How do you think of me? - Come on. - I won't work in the foundry. I won't do it. - Have you thought of going back to school? - School? I'm nearly 30. When I was 13, I was in the 4th class, and they skipped me into the 5th 'cause I was getting too old, and then they let me out. - You'll find another job, Quackser, I know you will, don't worry. - Well... If I can't make me own kinda work, I won't find it. Before, I could follow the horses anywhere in Dublin. I can remember a time when there was so many horses going around Dublin that the flowers used to grow up in the middle of the road. - Have you ever thought of going to America? - To the Bronx? - No, not just to the Bronx. - Me dancing at Trinity? I'd look funny there. - You're the man I want to dance with at night. - Yeah, but me dancing at Trinity... - Quackser, it's the last dance of the term before I have to go. Will you come? - Well, I will if you're sure. - I'm sure. - Well, where do I go to? - Why don't I meet you at the dance, okay? Because it's formal, and I have to get very dressed up. - Formal what? - Formal dress. But don't worry about that, just wear a good suit. - Are you going to a fancy dress ball, Quackser? - Not a ball, it's a dance, Gigi. Well, that's it. - Put a bit more black polishing them shoes. I can still see the brown coming through. - But you'll be late if you do. - Why, what time is it? - 10 to nine. - 10 to nine? Oh, I better run. And thanks for the loan of your bike, love. - But I-- - Don't wait up. - Oh, where's the Chinaman you've got? Joseph, take that, will you? The bigger, redder, shinier one... - Oh, look, John, just invited a story here. - Yeah, I saw my grandfather. - Oh, no, I think they're the plastic ones. No, no, no, it's so shiny when I look at them, and the way they go all the way down. - Oh, but how long? - Get off. - So you haven't seen me perform? - They'll see us waving at the bar! - Last turn and the turn before. - Oh no. - Damien, would you get me another drink? - Well, you haven't finished that one yet. - Please, Damien. - Of course. Well, what's the matter? - That man over there... - Who? - That man dancing with Elaine Boland. - You know him? - That's Quackser. - That's Quackser? You must be joking. - Damien, would you please take me outside? - Of course. - Thanks very much. Thanks. - Now, before the next dance, don't forget your raffle tickets. Our lovely lady still has two left. - Look at him. - Are we going? - I can't. - All right, let me go and speak to him. - Damien, I invited him. I should dance with him. - If you can bear it. - Now take your partner for the bossa nova. - Wait here for me, I'll be back. Quackser. Quackser! - Zazel, there you are. - Oh, you're all wet. - Yes, that was Elaine. Want to dance? What kind of a place is this? Everyone keeps handing me things. - You came all that way in the rain. You must be very hungry. - Not much. Did you like your dance? Did you? Did you like your dance with me? Hm? - Why don't we go outside and get some fresh air, okay? - Zazel? - Let me fix your tie. - I'll get the car. - Oh, thanks, I got me bike outside. - Look, I wasn't talking to you, you bloody fool. - Don't talk like that, Mister. - No, Damien, please. - Zazel, is this one of your bogman friends in his Sunday best? My God, a tacky penny-- - Look, you said he was plain, but this is ridiculous. - Damien, there's no need to be rude! - For God's sake, let's get out of here before I lose my temper. - Damien, please. - You better take your hands off her, Mister. - Look, I'm sorry. I don't like shit around my girlfriend. - Come on, chaps. - For Christ's sake, Damien! Do something! Let go of him! Stop it! You God damn bastards! Quackser. Are you all right? Are you okay? Bastards. - Did I ruin the party? - No, you were fine. They're just a bunch of drunks. - That's what I'm needing. - What? - A few more stiff drinks. - Let's do that. - Nothing's open at this hour. - Why don't we try one of the hotels? Do you want to do that? - If you think it's all right. - I know it's all right, and I'm treating. - Okay. Hop up. - Wait for me. Oh! - I think the bar is closed. - Well then, we won't go to the bar. - Then where are we going? - Well, we can always order from our room, can't we? - Do we have a room here? - No. 214, please. - Uh, what was that number again? - 214. - Oh. - Thank you. - Where are we going? - 214. - What if someone's in there? - I haven't figured that out yet. - Hey. Do me a favor, will ya? Take that to the big party upstairs. I'm gonna light up a smoke, my feet are killing me. - I hope it's empty. Mm. - Where do you want this, lady? - On that table please, sir. - You got a lovely place here. This bath is the size of my bedroom. - Where are ya? - Cheers to you, Mister! - Cheers to you, Missus. How do you like that? - Oh, oh! - We don't have any cups to drink from! - To hell with a cup! - And to hell with these brown shoes too! - And to hell with everything between us! - That's right! To hell with everything between us! And to hell with this duck's jacket. And to hell with starch linen! And to hell with boring ties! And to hell with underwear! - What are you doing in there? - I've always wanted to wash lying down. - What I want to know is how much you've paid for that suit? - It was a shilling for the trousers, and a shilling for the tail. - Two buckets? - That's it! - You having fun? - Look what I found! Bubbles! - Are you happy? - All I need now is a rubber duck. Why don't you come in with me? - I think I'll wait outside. - All right. Did you know that me ma used to work here? - That's a lovely suit! I wish I had one. - Hey! What's going on? Bloody idiot! - Hey! Come back over here! - What's up? - Your trousers. - And you digging up vengeance. Sweet God in heaven. Creating a hazardous situation. - Lucky for him, there was no damage done to city property. Do you know what they could've done to you? What I can't understand is what you were thinking of. It's time you thought about going off to your Cousin John in the Bronx. I'll write to him again this evening. It's a good thing for you we were first, and that the judge was a kind man. Me, pleading and begging for ya. - Our only son raised to be a shipless, don't want to think. It's time he thought about the world he lives in. But I'm not going to be working me arse off while you take a holiday. Make up your mind to that. It's either the foundry or America. - I'm buying, who's drinking? - That's the bloody American! - Save a pint for me, Tim. - Quackser, where the hell have you been? - I've been dancing. That's the trouble. - Hello, love. - Hello, Betsy. - Well, now. Will we be going to see your sweet face again, all your old pals, huh? - I don't think so. I came to tell ya, I'm off to the Bronx. - The Bronx? - The Bronx, is it? - I always knew you'd do well by yourself, man. - I always wanted to go to the Bronx. - She wanted to be a film star, you know? - Yeah, still do. - And there's no horses in the Bronx, Quackser. But there's plenty of cows. - God, you have lovely hands, Quackser. - I've got an aunt in St. Louis. - St. Louis? That's not in the Bronx, that's in France. - Ah, you think you know everything. - Pleasant journey, Quackser. - You'll be a rich man, Quackser. - Yeah, should take me about two weeks. - Ah, you're a grand feller, Quackser. - I know it. Well, God bless. - Good luck to ya. - And there's plenty more where this came from. ♪ What in the world - What of the bad news about Cousin John's death that did it to him, I wonder? - And to think that we were going to let him go without knowing. My poor son. Maybe we shouldn't have given him the bad news so sudden. - You all right? I think he must be, he's fast asleep. - Asleep? He's stone drunk. - Drunk? - Drunk? - I never had a chance to tell him that Cousin John is dead. After buying drink for every bloody scrounger in Dublin. - Not with the fare? - Yes. - With me dress money! - And he pawned my bicycle! - Quackser, are you spending all the money that was to take you to America? - Quackser, where's my dress money? - I want the money for me bike! - Gruesome son, get up! You're wasting a life's worth. You didn't want to go to America in the first place. Scared, scared as those horses that you've driven mad! - My money! - Here, here, let's all take it! - Oh, whose is this? - Mine. - I've got a pound. - A couple more. - Right, now that settles it. Tomorrow, he starts work at the foundry. Come along, Quackser. You don't want to be late the first day. Come on, you'll get used to it. - Fuck off. - Is that you, Mike? - Mike? It's me, Quackser. - Quackser? And I have some brown bread left, and them cold cuts. Is it all right? - It was fine, Betsy. It was fine. - I didn't put too much butter on, did I? I was afraid I put a little bit too much butter on. God, you have lovely hands, Quackser. Are you sure you don't want another cup of tea? Are you listening? Quackser? Are you there? - I'm here, Betsy. I'm here. You may be 15 years older, but there's none like you, Betsy. - Quackser. - Mhm? - That shovel. And you following the horses, them that's left. Not the most modern thing for a man like yourself. You knew that, didn't you, Quackser? - Betsy. There's nothing more modern than the feelings I have for you at this minute. - God, you have lovely hands, Quackser. - He's coming! He's coming now! - Hello, son. - Hello, Quackser, how are ya? - Over here now, sit down. Yeah, sit in the easy chair. That's it, make yourself comfortable. Now, would you like your tea? - Yeah. - Good. - I didn't get a job. - Did you look? - No. - Where were you? We were looking all over for you. - I was at the garage. What are you doing home so early, Dad? - Business. - Are you all right, son? - I'm fine. - Good. - I'm fine. What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong. - Quackser, I've been meaning to tell ya, there's no hurry getting my bicycle from the pawn office, just in case you were worrying about it. - What's up? - You're are, son. Do you remember your poor old Cousin John in the Bronx? - Oh, I saw a lovely dress on the way to work this morning. - For God's sake, would you tell him, Pete? Your Cousin John remembered you in his will. His stipulation on his deathbed, that you are to receive the money from the sale of his motorcar. He's out there leaving you $500 to do what you like with. - $500? - That's it. - How much is that in real money? - Over 200 pounds. - 200 pounds? - Over 200 pounds. Now you can carry out your plans for progress after all, huh? - I saw a lovely dress on my way to work this morning. - You can even go to America if you want to. - Well, only recommendation I have for you, Quackser is, keep away from pubs for a while. What are you gonna do with the money anyway? The horses are gone for good. - Why would give over talk about horses now? - He could buy a new bicycle now anyway. - Quackser, are you all right? - I've made up me mind! - Now don't be rash. - What are you going to do? - I'm going to buy a motorcar! By the way, did you know that Dublin is actually a Danish name? It means "Black River". Now, Jonathan Swift, who actually wrote "Gulliver's Travels", was erector of this cathedral over here which is St. Patrick's Cathedral. I used to have my lunches there everyday when I was working on another job. - Mr. Fortune, would you mind, please? - And did you know that Messiah's Handel had its world premier here?
