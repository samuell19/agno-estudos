It's a win-win, and you'll be reunited with your daughter back east, and I'll make sure that your treasured home gets the buyer who appreciates what a rare gem this is. Thank you, have a nice day. You too. You know, I think... Let's go with the penthouse. Okay. Excuse me. Meg, honey. Where are you? Beverly Hills. The Aspen Wall mansion? Mm-hm, we got the listing. You are relentless. You've been on the hunt for that since before you even met me. Hm, it's hereditary. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, your family's treasure hunters. Blah, blah, blah. How's it going over there? Well, Ms. Oswald is here and she wants to sign on the penthouse. Don't you dare let that happen. She doesn't want a big house. I'll convince her. There'll be a bigger commission. Fine, I can buy you an hour, but hurry. Perfect. I'll admit, I've always loved this house, but I never thought Babs would put it on the market, so I just forgot about it. Well just because something is forgotten doesn't mean it's not worth finding again. You know, the penthouse apartment is nice, but a property like this, so much space. So many rooms for children and grandchildren. I can hear it now. The pitter-patter of all those little feet on the vintage oak floors. I like the sound of that. Let me call my accountants. I think we can make this work. Amazing. I will write that offer up for you right away. Thank you. Look forward to talking to you. Of course. After you. Babe, you are amazing. I know. Couple more commissions like that, we're gonna be partners in no time. Just think, maybe we should start looking for that property that the partners want for their resort. Come on, it'd be champagne, penthouses and ski trips for us. I don't know if a penthouse is for me. I always thought something like this. A little bit more homey. Babe, home is where you put your stuff between the office and the golf course. Hello. Um, thank you for letting me know. What's up? I... I have to go. Well, what happened? Are you okay? 100K, baby. Whoa, watch it. Why don't you watch where you're... What? No harm, no foul, right? Yeah, luckily. Hate to be stuck here waiting for AAA. Lakewood's not so bad. I could show you around if you want. No need. I grew up here. Oh. Oh, you must be here for the Tomato Toss. Mm. Rather go to jury duty. Wow, you are pretty judgemental for somebody who hasn't apologized yet for almost hitting me with her car. Who died and made you grumpy? My father. If you'll excuse me. Coffee, please. Meg? Oh my gosh, is that you? Sarah. Hi. Oh my gosh. Look at you with that LA glow. Oh my goodness, I haven't seen you since you stormed outta a lake with like a bat outta heck. Seems like just yesterday I was sneaking you waffles outta the back of this place and now it's all mine. Hm. Oh, I'll have that to go. Oh. Okay. I know it seems pretty quiet in here now, but you should see this place at breakfast. These farmers can put away an alarming amount of pancakes. Gary says sometimes I flip 'em in my sleep. Gary? Yeah, my husband. Wait, Gary, Gary from high school? Very same. I know, high school sweethearts to Lakewood power couple. He runs the hardware store in town. Wow. You have got to come by for dinner to meet our daughter Kimmy. She is amazing. She's got dreams as big as a mountain, attention span as deep as a puddle. Sarah, when you've got a second, can I grab a refill? In a second, Kyle. Oh, I'm not staying long. Have to just meet with my father's lawyer. Oh, right. God, listen to me babbling on. I was so sorry to hear about Frank. How are you doing? Oh, um, fine, thanks. We weren't that close. Right. Well, he will really be missed around here. He was a real gem, your pop. I could just grab a coffee pot myself. In a second, Kyle. I am reuniting with my oldest friend, okay? Learn a little patience and you might go far in life. I'm a doctor. Some people are so oblivious. Sarah, it was lovely running into you. Oh, right. Oh, you gotta go. I know, but hold on one second. Call me anytime, day or night. I appreciate that. Thanks. Sarah. Coming, Kyle. Megan. Good to see you again. Oh, Don, you too. Ah, sorry, I had to drag you all the way out to settle the estate. Mm, it's okay. It's good to be back here again. Mm, well, it was one of Frank's conditions that we do this here. - Typical dad. - Mm. Wait. One of his conditions? Did you know your dad was in the process of turning the house into an exhibit? No, we hadn't talked in a while. Hm. Frank was particularly proud of his local finds. He wanted to create a museum that was a tribute to Lakewood. Are you sure it wasn't a tribute to Frank the incredible explorer extraordinaire? Here it is. It being? Your father's final wishes all encased in the hidden compartment in his treasured desk. The presentation was all a part of it, sorry. Frank loved a bit of drama. First, his last will and testament, a copy of which he entrusted with me for safekeeping in a vault. Second, Frank's personal diary. And last but not least, the centerpiece of your father's legacy. The one prize that alluded him. The reason he moved to Lakewood in the first place. The map to the long lost treasure of Lakewood. That old thing. My dad used to stare at that for hours. Yeah, your father wanted to leave his collection with someone who would care for it and share it with the world. He wanted that someone to be you. Why do I sense a gigantic but? But you wanted to make sure you were the right person, so he left you a task. Use this map to find the treasure of Lakewood, the one puzzle he could never solve. You do this, you inherit everything. The house, the land, the whole sha-bang. Great. So he left me with an impossible task. What happens if I don't wanna jump through his hoops? The whole thing gets handed over to a trust he set up and they'll install their own curator. Is there a a deadline? Two weeks, and then the curator position goes to a vote. So he left me two weeks to solve a mystery that has baffled him for decades? And people wonder why our relationship was so complicated. I'm just the messenger. Do you do a lot of treasure hunt will readings, Don? Well, this is my first. Your father, he was a dear friend, but he sure could be exhausting. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're telling me that you get all that land? Yeah, I guess. Babe, I'm just throwing this out there, but if you can get all that land, it's the perfect spot for the resort. What, you mean the partners' dream project? Yes. They've been looking for a perfect spot for years and if we could deliver that to them. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, just because this place holds a lot of bad memories doesn't mean I wanna see it get turned into Disneyland Minnesota. Babe, it's like I was saying the other day. Something like this is career rocket fuel. It would shoot us straight to the top. We'd be able to pick whatever office we want, whatever project we want. We'd be able to start building our dream home. Okay, I'll give it one shot. But even if I find anything, I'm not making any promises, okay? Let's just collect all the cards before we fold, okay? All right. Let's find some treasure. Let's find some treasure. Not big reader in LA, are ya? Hello? You talking to a scarecrow? Looks like that hurt. Oh. You again. If only there was a sign telling you how to keep out. Yeah, well. What are you doing up high again? I'm getting a bird's eye view of the scarecrow to see if it works, which clearly it doesn't. Okay, look, I lost my dad a couple years ago, so I'm sorry about earlier. But what are you doing here on my land? We got off on the wrong foot. How about we start over? I'm Meg Davis. I'm Tom. You might have known my father Frank. He fancied himself something of an explorer. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I caught him stiffing around a few times. Hence the sign. Yeah, I can explain that. He came across this map. Supposedly it leads to Lakewood's long lost treasure? Became obsessed hunting it down. On my land? No. I'm not that lucky. Besides, what's that gotta do with you? He left me in sort of a tricky position. In order to inherit his estate, I must find this so-called treasure. Well, look, it's getting late and I don't really have time for a wild goose chase, so. Yeah, that wasn't an invitation. Take my word. Inheritances aren't always all they're cracked up to be. Well, can I at least look around? Everything you need to know is on that sign. You might wanna wash that shoe. There's a chance that that mud you stepped in ain't mud. Look at you. Not even good enough for ketchup. Come on, boys. This is our last shot and you're letting me down. Ah, you might wanna give 'em a break. And yourself. I don't know what dad's secret was, mom. I don't have the touch. Ugh, that new fertilizer's not working out for you then? No. And for what we paid for it, we ought to be fighting off tomato monsters by now. Well... Ugh, yeah, I'd say you get an early night. Things always look better in the morning. Antique mayonnaise. Gross. Restaurants near me. Closed, closed, closed. Open. About an hour away. Daddy really did drag us out to the boonies. Hey, Sarah, it's Meg. Does your diner deliver? Some family motto. More like a curse. Ugh. Did you drag that all the way from the field just to scare me? Yes, I did. And it was totally worth it. So I was thinking, this treasure you're looking for, is it valuable? It can be. Okay, so let's make a deal. You and I go hunting for it together and whatever we find, we split 50/50. It's my map. It's my land. Deal, but the scarecrow stays in the car. Sarah. Hi. Oh, you are a lifesaver. Oh, just being neighborly. - Hi, Tom. - Hey. I didn't know you two knew each other. So you're saying dinner, huh? No, no, no, I was just on my way out. Nonsense, there's plenty. Come on, help me heat this up. The others are bringing in the rest. Go on. The... The others? Uh... Gary, hi. Hi, Meg. Great to see you. This is Kimmy. Mom says you live in Los Angeles. Do you know Lady Gaga? I did show her a house once. Sarah? Kimmy. It's been a while. How is school? School's boring. I'm thinking about quitting. You're not quitting school. But I'm already so smart. So Tom, how's your mom? She's good. You know her back kind of bothers her, but she doesn't like to complain. And the farm? Think you'll have the tomatoes ready for the annual Tomato Toss? Yes, you betcha. Yeah. I'll tell you, Meg, this place hasn't changed a bit. My dad liked to preserve history. I don't know what to say, Sarah. This is incredible. You know I'm always happy for an excuse to make anything other than burgers and waffles. So let's dig in. Is it true in Los Angeles everybody works in the movies? Not really. Do you have a star on that Hollywood celebrity street? - No, but- - Let her eat in peace, Kimmy. No, you know what? Actually, I kind of want to hear this answer. I do have a door mat with my name on it. Cool. Oh, no thank you. I'm a vegetarian. Oh. Yeah, me too. Thanks. So, meet at the forest first thing? I'll be there. And make sure you wear something a little bit more appropriate. Excuse me? Your shoes. The city heels ain't gonna cut it in the mountains. See you there. Well, best of luck with the treasure hunt tomorrow. Mm. I half wish it gets turned into a dud, then I don't have to deal with Tom for much longer. Well, I know quite a few ladies in town that wouldn't mind dealing with Tom. And on that note. Goodnight, Meg. But I still have more questions. Kimmy. - Goodnight, Kimmy. - Goodnight. You see that? That's what a good dad looks like. And a dad who's obsessed with treasure hunting makes his daughter go on a wild goose chase to claim her inheritance. You want me to read this journal so I can tell the whole world how great you are, right? Night, dad. Hi there. Hey. I'm June, Tom's mom. And you must be Frank's daughter Meg. Ah, by DNA only. Nice to meet you. You too. Mom, what are you doing? We gotta get going. I thought you kids might like little adventure juice. That is very sweet. Thank you. Thanks, mom. You are very welcome. I just, you know, your little treasure hunt reminded me of when he was a kid, he'd go on all these adventures. Remember. you'd always say, "I need some adventure juice." Name stuck. Yeah. What's in it? It's just lemonade and orange juice. And a hint of cinnamon. Mm, sounds delicious. I've tasted that before when I was a kid. The annual Tomato Toss. That's right. Yeah, we serve it there every year. And we also supply all the tomatoes for the big free for all. Yeah, we would, if someone hadn't ruined the crop. Tom, that's not your fault. I'm not following. It's nothing. Don't worry about it. We should probably get going. We've got a lot of ground to cover. Love you, mom. I love you. - Nice to meet you. - Good luck. So, tell me about this map. Not much to say. It's old, it's well preserved. It was drawn up by somebody who signed it "ZL." Dad found it on one of his excursions. Supposedly it leads to Lakewood's long lost treasure, whatever that is. And how long was he looking for this treasure? Decades. That's why we moved here. Uprooted our entire life to find it. He became obsessed. Great, so this should be a piece of cake. This way. You sure? I was a Girl Scout. I got this. Okay, should be right up here. Ah. Deja vu. How long has it been since your Girl Scouting days? Not so long that I've forgotten how I got my knife skill badge. Well, I guess you don't need a compass when you take Ubers everywhere, huh? I'd like to see you navigate the 405. Okay. I'm taking over. This needs a fresh eye. Wait. Wait, this is a trick. What do you mean? Here. See, the path seems right, but if you're a local, you know that the landmarks are reversed. Heh. Never give a city girl a country boy's job. I think you're wrong, country boy. But knock yourself out. I'm gonna stay right here. I'm sure I'll see you soon. - With the treasure. - Mm-hm. Have fun. - Don't. - Peace offering. Last of the adventure juice. Look, this map is obviously sending us in circles. We need to pool our resources. I'm listening. Let's look at the map together. Okay, it's trying to trick us. Let's just look for things that are wrong. Well here. The instructions say go north to Eagles Mound but I know for a fact that that's south of the path. Great. And look at this. The map says that it's looking east at dawn, but those shadows don't make sense. Let's just assume that the time of day is right. These shadows indicate that we should be going south. Let's go south. If we got this right, the X marks the River Lookout. We used to go here for picnics when I was a kid. So we did it. Right? Did we do it? Yeah, I think we did. It doesn't match. What? The river bend, it doesn't match. Look. From this vantage point, we should be able to see the cave. Did we do something wrong? Wait a minute, there is something else. What is that? I used to look forward to seeing this here when I was a kid. Thought it was really magical. Meg, there's a tiny key. This has to be a hiding place. Yeah, it is. When I was little, my dad would put me on these treasure hunts to this garden dweller. It's where I found this locket. So what if there's something underneath? - Okay, help me move it. - Okay. All right. It's empty. Someone got to it before we did. Maybe it's just another dead end. Wait, wait. Hey, "FD," initials carved right here at the base. Yeah, Frank Davis, my dad. It makes sense. He probably put it here in the first place. Wait. Wait. "ZL?" Hold on. "ZL," right there on the map. That has to mean something. Meaning what? It's just another loose end? Help me move it back. You know what? I learned something very important today. What's that? That even during the good times, my father just had a hidden agenda. How so? I used to cherish these picnics here. But instead of father-daughter bonding time, he was just looking for this stupid treasure. Well, I think your father loved you very much. Whatever. Well hey, you two. Did you guys find anything? Only more proof that my dad is exactly who I thought he was. I'll get a table. Well, you're not gonna give up, are you? This whole thing is ridiculous. I feel like I lost my mind. But no, I am not a quitter. Good. And at least you get to go crazy around some pretty scenery. I never, ever see another tree again, I'll be happy. Mm, that's not the scenery I was talking about. I don't know what you're dogging about. Hm, then why are you blushing? Sarah. Please make up your mind. I would just kill for some cauliflower wings. Well, unfortunately, in a small town, you can't always get exactly what you want and when you want it. But if you try what we do have, you just might like it. Hello. Hi, you guys ready? I would love a Juicy Lucy, please. - Okay. - Salad it for me. All right. And a basket of the deep fried tater tots for the table. Coming right up. Mm. Man, these are good. How's your salad? Crisp and fresh and unlikely to glue my arteries together. Hm. Suit yourself. I'm gonna hit the restroom. Mm. Mm. What uh, what happened here? A bird ate them. A bird? What she said. So guys, what's the next step? Mm, I don't think there is one. The map is misleading on purpose. It's starting to feel like a gigantic prank. Sarah, do you have wifi here? My reception is bad in this town. Yep, code's on the menu, hun. Hm. I don't know how you live like that. I couldn't get a thought between the beeps. I like it, it makes me feel productive. Productive or just busy? Why don't you try and cut yourself off sometime? I'm not an addict. That's exactly what addicts say. Do yourself a favor and switch off every now and then. Give silence a try. Hey. I heard you two. Oh, I take it we aren't exactly rolling in diamonds yet? Wild goose chase, Mom. It's been a long day. I should go. No, why don't you come in for some cake? I... It's really good cake. Sure. Why not? Great. Thank you. Mm-hm. Mm. They do not make cake like this in Los Angeles. You ever miss it here? No. I mean, it wasn't all bad, but no, I like my life. Well, still. I mean, you won't be ashamed to say goodbye to that gorgeous house of yours? It was my dad's house. I just lived there. Besides, we're no closer to finding of this treasure, so the house might not be hers anyway. - Tom. - What? You are no help with that attitude. Look, don't mind him. You get that map out, I'm gonna grab my cheaters. All right. How old is this map? We don't know. Why, does that change things? Typical kids don't see the trees for the forest. Look, see, these are aspens. I mean, they haven't grown in this area for decades. They cut 'em all down and replaced 'em with spruce. Produces more lumber. Whoever drew this map, I mean they drew it beautifully, but it was a long, long time ago. So if there was some sort of geographical shift, that would explain why things don't match up. We gotta go to the library tomorrow. What time do they open? 9:00 AM. Meet me there? Yeah. Untucked is better. Okay, good, 'cause I don't know how to dress for a library. You look very library appropriate. Thank you. Hey, you two. - Hey. - What are you doing here? Well, Kimmy has a homework project and I'm trying to teach her the value of using books instead of Google. - How's that going? - Slow. You know, it can also be profitable. Why don't you go ask the librarian for all the information that they have on the history of Lakewood? Thank you. Did you just bribe a child? No, I stimulated the local economy. Mm. As kids, they always warned us to stay outta the mine shafts. Hm. It's strange. There's accounts of what the town was like when it was founded. The mining times. But then there's this huge gap, like something happened and no one could bring themselves to write about it. Did you find something? Yeah, it's a map of the land that my farm is on. There's the farmhouse, there's the field, there's the creek, there's this spot that you trespassed on. Trespass? I half climbed a fence. Yeah, and thank God I was there to stop you. Who knows what kind of trouble you'd have caused? How long has your family lived there? Since the town was founded over a hundred years ago. Hm. Quite a legacy. Yeah. And it's only taken me two years to flush it down the drain. What do you mean? There was an infestation three years ago. Parasites. They destroyed our crops, left our land practically barren. I think it was the stress dealing with it that was the final straw for my dad. I'm so sorry. When I took over, I was convinced that I was gonna turn it around and make him proud. But whatever I try, crops fail and we just get deeper and deeper in the hole. Mm, and that's why you need the treasure. Yeah, without it, I think Larson's Tomato Farm is over. You do realize that none of this is your fault, right? Yeah, but it doesn't feel like that. I have seen you these past couple of days. Okay, you care about this and you're doing everything that you can to fix it. No one expects more than that. I appreciate that. You know, for a snooty big city girl, you're not so bad. And for a tree climbing scarecrow loving country boy, you could be worse. Okay, we need to focus. We need to fill in the gaps of what happened to the mines. Yeah, but if there's no information here, then where? Do you ever realize that what you've been looking for has been under your nose the entire time? What, your dad? My dad. Who's driving the Tool-Mobile? I don't know. Maybe somebody from my dad's estate? Want me to get him to leave? Leave? What do you mean? Just got here. Royce, what are you doing here? I came to help with the treasure hunt. Tried to call, but none of my calls seem to go through. Yeah, signal's very sketchy. Mm. Oh, um, Tom, this is my boyfriend, Royce. Royce, this is Tom. Ah. Meg said she had a run in with the locals. I didn't say it like that. But this is great. I mean, even better than I imagined. Put the chalets over there, tennis courts down there, golf course went over there. This is great. - What do you mean? - Oh, she didn't tell you? Well, when we win the property, we're gonna let our bosses turn it into a luxury resort. Really? Oh, yeah. In a year's time, Lakewood's gonna be the hotspot for city folk looking to take a load off. Oh, won't that be a lovely surprise for the people people of Lakewood? - Won't it? - Yeah. That way you don't ever have to come back here again. You comin'? Ooh, gorgeous. This place is like an exhibit in a museum. My father curated these artifacts from all over the world. Some of them are from this area. Never really liked museums. No, always kind of found 'em to be a bore. Anyone find anything? Well, here's a statue of a couple coal miners. That's interesting. Tell you what's interesting. This view. It's gonna be incredible when we level this place and build a resort. The golf course is gonna look amazing from up here. Anything? Yeah, look at this. Larson and Nelson. This Larson guy must be my ancestor. I've never seen this. I don't know how or where your dad unearthed it. Hello? Meg, hi. It's Don. I'm afraid I got some news. I've got some news is never good news. I was trying to make sure that Frank's will was concrete and I was reviewing the trust bylaws and the thing is, well... Come on, Don. We're on the clock here. That's the thing. I hate to tell you this, but according to the bylaws, the clock didn't start when you received the map. When did it start? When Frank died. Oh, perfect. So instead of two full weeks, we have- - You only have three days left. Three days? I wanted to tell you as soon as I found out. If you haven't found the treasure by the time the vote occurs, I'm afraid there's nothing I can do. I just wish you would've figured this out sooner. Sorry, Meg. Me too. Bye. Judging by the looks on your faces, you got the gist of that. So what now? We need more eyes. None of this means much to any of us, but to the people of this town, maybe there's a connection that we're not seeing. So what do we do? Go door to door with photos of the artifacts. Or we bring them to us. Exactly. We pop some bottles of champagne, put out some charcuterie. Maybe play some music. I don't get it. Oh, Tim. Tom. You are in for a pleasant surprise, my friend. You're about to experience one of Royce and Meg's famous open houses. Not bad for a half day's notice if I do say so myself. Oh well, we make a pretty great team, don't we? Hi, you two. Hey. This place looks amazing. Yeah, it's um, it's all right. Is it, Tim? It's Tom. Well, I better go make the rounds. You should as well, hon. Wish us luck. Okay, I'm gonna take small groups of people upstairs to go look at the museum. Just keep a listen down here and enjoy the food and champagne and more importantly, have fun. Okay. You have fun, too. Or, um... Oh. Mm. Ooh. Okay. Meg and Royce put on quite the show. Yeah, it must be easy to throw a party when money's no object and you wanna show people you're better than them. This place is amazing. I never knew Lakewood had such a rich history. We should make coming here a part of the annual Tomato Toss Festival. - Yeah. - Oh. Enjoy it while you can, 'cause pretty soon this is gonna be one giant golf course. Oh, great. I love golf. Shut up, Kyle. You know, I really must say it's kind of great to see all of Frank's hard work on display like this. Yeah, turns out he wasn't completely useless after all. You know, Meg, I know you had your struggles with him, but over the last few years, he became a really important part of this town. People liked talking to him. He made people feel like their history mattered. Yeah, it's not as noble as it sounds. He probably was just looking for clues on that treasure. Maybe. But just look at how much care he put into this exhibit. Just with a little attention, this could really become a local attraction. Kimmy, don't touch that. Hey. Hey. Having a good time? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's great. Can we talk? Yeah, what's up? In private? Oh, okay. Look, this is your house. You can do whatever you want with it, but- - But? But what? What do you mean? If we find this treasure, are you really gonna let Royce turn this into a playground for the rich and famous? Look, I don't know. My feelings about this place are complicated. Take this locket, for example. It used to remind me of my dad and then it reminded me that he was gone most of the time. I get that this place is special for everyone else, but for me it was a lot of lonely nights. But you are really gonna give this all up just to get back at him? It's not about him. He's gone. Okay, Royce was right. The past is an anchor and if I wanna move forward, if I want my career to flourish, I need to start looking to the future. You're sure. Meg, Tim. Still Tom. Right. We got a bite. See, Larson and Nelson. The Nelson guy must have been old Wyatt Nelson's ancestor. If anyone remembers anything about the mines back then, it'll be him. Great job, Kyle. This looks like the place. This guy. Looks like he's preserved in coal dust and moonshine. Sure there's not a shotgun up there? All righty then. Hey, you're a local. I'm sure he'd prefer to hear from a familiar face. Good morning, sir. Wherever it is, I don't want none. Nothing good ever arrives in a car that fancy. Let's just go. Mr. Nelson, I'm Tom Larson. You might know my dad, Adam. He used to bring you supplies every now and then. I remember Adam Larson. He was good people. Well, this is Meg. Her father was Frank Davis. Oh, I know Frank Davis, too. Hm, doesn't sound like he's a fan. Mr. Nelson, we just wanna ask a few questions about Lakewood and what happened to the mines. Fine but that's only 'cause your daddy was good to me, Larson. We're actually here about the treasure of Lakewood. Not that I think it actually exists, but you gotta try, right? Is there anything you can tell us about the mines, the mountains? I'll tell you if you shut up. It's not a long story as my daddy remembered it. Lakewood in the early days weren't much of a town. Things were peaceful until somebody dug up a gigantic ruby. It don't take much to light a spark of greed when the people don't have much, and with a rock like that, well, the fighting started almost immediately. And who won? No one wins a fight like that, son. When the dust settled, the ruby was gone. There's always suspicions that one of the town founders, Zach Larson. Yes, Tom, your kin, had took it, but it never resurfaced again while he was alive. What happened to the mines? All I know is it's been abandoned for decades. There was a terrible accident. They breached a hidden cave and the side of the mountain just caved in on itself, taking the miners with it. That's why your map doesn't line up. They blew up the freaking mountain. It was a dark time for the community. The survivors banded together and they rebuilt and focused on farming instead of mining and fighting. That fight, is that what the festival's about, with the tomato battle? It was meant to be a way to let bygones be bygones, to turn a tragic accident into a celebration. People don't like to dwell on the hard times. That's very important to remember. Sorry, I can't be more of help in your little treasure huntin'. Yeah. Got something to say, son? You know, it just feels like you're holding out on us a little bit, like you know a little more than what you're saying. What if I did? I know how this game is played. - Royce. - No, no, no, it's okay. It's business. Not gonna get something for nothing, am I right? Anything else you can remember? You'll pay me $100 to tell you whether I know something else or not? Well do ya? See, I told you. Now let's hear it. The answer to your question is... Is? We're waitin'. It's simple. Uh? I don't know anything else. Scout's honor. Y'all have a nice day. Hey kiddo. What you got there? Math. Yeah? You need some help? Well hey Meg, how was Nelson's? Charming. I got his decorator's number. So no luck, huh? Another in a series of dead ends, and I'm afraid this might be our final one. I'm sorry, Meg. Hey, pie's on me. Hey Meg. Guess what? I'm gonna go to LA just like you. Oh, really? Do you mind telling me about this later? Well, unfortunately, I don't think there's anything edible here. Ooh, you should try the tater tots. They are delicious. Yeah, birds like 'em too. Yeah, I think I'm just gonna wait to eat. All right, y'all ready? Yes, salad for me, tater tots and coffee for the table and burgers for the boys, please. Actually, do you have anything a little less fried back there? Royce. Sorry about him. Sarah. It's been a long day. You know what? I don't think this is my kind of place. Sorry. Royce. Where are you going? There is a country club not far from here with a golf course and sushi. I need civilization. Why are you being so hotheaded? Why are you and your farmer friend so chummy? What? What are you implying? Do you need to tell me something, Meg? No, of course not. I'll see you tomorrow. You know, you always said your dad spent as little time here as possible. I'm starting to see why. What's his problem? There's a lot riding on this for both of us. Yeah. I guess country life's not really for everybody. Maybe he needs a spa day or a massage or a mani pedi. I know somebody who makes organic moisturizer in case his hands get a little too rough. You do realize that you're talking about my boyfriend, right? Yeah, I know, but you gotta admit, it's a bit much. Look, I know he can be a lot. But he did come all this way to help me. He's very passionate about our future. Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry. I should get going. My mom's expecting me. Gross. I think boys are dumb. Agreed. Meg, hey. What are you doing here? I was looking for Tom. Probably not gonna be here for much longer. I wanted to thank him for his help. Yeah, he came home in a bit of a mood last night. Is everything all right? Yeah. He left pretty quickly last night, but... Meg, you know Tom, he likes to joke around a lot, but he's always a little on edge around the annual Tomato Toss. Why? Well... See the Tomato Toss, it was always his daddy's proudest moment of the year. You take a big haul of tomatoes down to the recreation and since the farm's been struggling, we haven't been able to contribute and I'm afraid that Tom, he sees it as a personal failing. I'd like to patch things up. Do you know where I can find him? How do you feel about climbing trees? I'm coming up. What's up, Peter Pan? Where are your Lost Boys? What are you doing here? Probably gonna be heading out soon. Yeah. Need to get back to work? And Royce? I'm sorry about the treasure. Is your farm gonna be okay? Yeah. We'll figure it out. Sorry for you, though. We didn't find anything. Yeah, well just 'cause we didn't find anything doesn't mean it was all bad. Yeah, it was kind of fun. Okay. It was interesting seeing the other Meg yesterday. Other Meg? Yeah. Business Meg. The Meg you become with Royce. City Meg. Maybe that's the real Meg. That's a shame 'cause country Meg's a lot more fun. If you're gonna be like this, I can just go. I'm sorry. You know, maybe it's just confusing for you to meet someone whose life is a little bit more complicated than hanging out in tree houses all day. I don't think your life's that complicated. You just do whatever it takes to get the next big payday the fastest. Simple. Is this about the resort? I still haven't decided if I'm gonna sell the estate or not. Besides, it's none of your business. Okay, it's my dad, my estate, my career. My, my, my. Wow, do they teach self-centeredness in year one of business school or year two? - Shut up, Tom. - Did you major in it? Okay, look, you idiot. Is that? Cave? Cave. Okay, we passed the petrified stump. There's the overhanging ledge. Must be just around here. Oh, yes. We did it. You did it. Guess there's still some country left in you after all, huh? Here, help me. Tom, look. "My arms hold up a stony sky, my muscles stiff as boards. Amid the rubble at my feet, you'll find my hidden hoard." How did we miss that? What does that mean? Stony sky? Could it be the roof of the cave? Muscles stiff as boards. It's gotta be the supports. Let's go take a look. Yeah. Tom! "ZL". Zach Larson. This must be the one. I can't believe it. Here. A journal. A journal? What happened to the giant ruby? Unbelievable. It's Zach Larson's accounts of founding the town. It's an incredible historical find. You should be thrilled. It's written by one of your ancestors. This could be the Declaration of Independence. It doesn't matter. It's not gonna help me save my farm. This was my last hope. I'm sorry, Tom. Where are you going? I gotta go do some thinking. I, I'll see you later. Hello? Meg, Kimmy's not with you, is she? No, I haven't seen her all day. Is everything okay? She didn't turn up for school today. A bunch of her clothes are missing. We think that she ran away. I don't know what to do. I'll come get you. Gary's off checking all Kimmy's favorite spots and I've just been waiting here until she comes back. Oh, Sarah. Sarah, slow down. It's almost nightfall. I don't know what to do. I'm sure she's gonna be fine. Did she leave some sort of note? Just this. "Off to live somewhere more exciting. Back for Christmas probs." Oh, boy. I think I have an idea. Come on. Kimmy. Thank God. Mom. Don't you ever run off like that again on me, do you understand? What were you thinking? I heard Meg was going back to LA and I wanted to go with her. Mind if I talk to her? So, why do you wanna move to LA? It's boring here. They are just trees and mountains and nothing ever happens. I know that the city can seem exciting, but Lakewood might surprise you. I mean just this week I made new friends, I threw a party, explored a cave. Ooh, where's the cave? I'll tell you about that later. What I'm trying to say is that there's still a lot that this town has to offer. I suppose. If you promise to not give your mom any more heart attacks, I promise I'll let you come visit me in LA. You swear? I swear. Sorry to interrupt girls night, ladies. I need to speak to Meg privately, though. I have to take Sarah and Kimmy home. No worries. I texted Gary. He's on his way to get us. Perfect. Shall we? - You sure? - Yeah, go ahead. Thanks. Oh. So what is this all about? All right, I've been thinking. We have had some setbacks, but I have a new foolproof plan on how we're gonna get the estate. I'm listening. We sue the trust. Come on. All this treasure hunt mumbo jumbo can't be legal. We get a couple high powered attorneys on it, they'll file some injunctions on all sorts of technicalities. Royce. What? What's that? The treasure of Lakewood. Okay, but it's a book? You're sure? Pretty sure. You're telling me this means we win? Yeah, I guess so. Maybe. All right, then well I'll start making some calls and we'll have this place down to the studs in a week. I'm not selling. Of course you're selling. It's our future. No, it's not. Not anymore. Meg, you're kidding me. Don't tell me you wanna hang around here showing off your dad's old junk. Okay, that came, that came out wrong. This old house is getting to us, okay? Why don't we go to the country club, relax at the spa and we'll talk about this when we've cooled off. I'm gonna stay here, thank you. All right, but I'm not giving up. Not when we're this close. I'm sorry, mom. About what? Letting you down. No, you haven't failed me or anybody else. This family's about a lot more than a couple of tomatoes or a plot of land. It's love. No matter what happens to the farm, we'll always have that. Yeah, love doesn't pay the bills. Honey, something will come up. We just have to be patient. Tom. Royce. What's up? Pay back. What are you doing here? I brought you this journal. It belongs to your family. It must be so easy to just change your mind about what is or isn't important. You know, some of us actually have to make hard decisions. What do you mean? The offer on my dad's farm. Royce just called. You're selling to Royce? You know what? Go back to LA and enjoy your bonus or your promotion or whatever. I'm so glad I could help you add a zero to your paycheck. Goodbye, Meg. Meg. We did it. We got the resort. How could you? How could I what? Save the day? You had no right to meddle into Tom's life like that. Slow down, okay. I did this for us. And you get the best of both worlds. You get your house and you get your job and he gets paid. Win, win, win, win, win. You always do this. You act in your own interest and you pretend like it's what we both wanted. You should have asked me first. Look, I'm sorry, but it's a done deal. June comes tomorrow to sign the paperwork and then I'm off to the Alps. With or without you, sweetheart. Definitely without me. We're done. Oh, Meg. Come on, you're breaking up with me? Don't be silly. No, sticking in a relationship that doesn't work is being silly. I'm choosing to be smart. Goodbye, Royce. Oh, and by the way, you're a terrible skier. Almost as bad as you are at golf. Rude. Hello. Meg, it's Don. Just called to see how things were going. Oh yeah, we we actually found it. You found the treasure? Yeah, it was a journal that belonged to one of the founders. Well that's fantastic. But your tone does not sound like it's fantastic. I just, I'm just thinking about what it all means. Well, it's up to you. You can stick around or the board can vote to appoint a new custodian. What do you wanna do? Um... You heard from Royce? I did, he said the contract is ready to sign. I'm gonna meet him on the library steps at noon to do the paperwork. You sure you want to go through with this? Tom, it's a good thing. You know, give us enough to start fresh. You going to the Tomato Toss? No. No, I'm not in the mood. We had a bad crop. So what? Mom, they had to outsource the tomatoes for the festival. I feel like a failure. Honey, the people of Lakewood, they don't love you any less and your father wouldn't have either. He loved his son unconditionally. He'd be so proud of the effort you've put into this place. And he wouldn't want you to spend your whole life doing what you think he wants you to do. You have to pursue what you love. That's what the Larson family motto's all about. Wherever your heart is, find your home. So where's my heart, mom? Well I think she's currently packing. If I had half a chance with Meg, I blew it yesterday. She's with Royce, anyway. Really? Not according to Royce. What do you mean? I don't gossip. Mom. Well Royce said Meg broke up with him. What happened? Oh, well, I don't know. I'm sure she probably had a good reason to do it. Honey, it's not a tough puzzle to solve. Wait. Mom, that's it. A puzzle. What do you mean? Mom, you cracked it. The journal. It's not the treasure, it's a clue. It's the clue. You're the the best. Thank you. I'm the best. Meg. Meg! Meg! Hello? Hey. Hey, I need to talk to you. You could have just called. In person. Okay, hold on a second. Mind telling me what this is all about? I have a plane to catch. Okay, but what if you didn't? You made it pretty clear that there's nothing left for me in Lakewood. Okay, I deserve that. But check this out. Look, see all these extra letters? This is gibberish, right? But I bet if we decode these, it'll take us to the treasure. It's a puzzle, Meg. It's a final puzzle. Wait, a key. It was never a physical key. It must have been something to break the code. Okay, are we still at a dead end? Not necessarily. Maybe my dad found something to crack it. Yeah, but we've already been through his entire collection. Oh. Hey, uh, what are you doin'? Ah. My father's journal for some light reading. "April 12th. Outside Knysna. The heat is oppressive. It makes me miss the gentle autumn nights by the lake. I wish I was home with the girls. I miss them so much, but this is for them, too. I have to remember that. I sent Sandra another set of instructions for an adventure for little Meg. Hopefully she thinks of me as she solves it. I can't wait until she's ready to come on some real adventure with me." You okay? I always thought his adventures were distractions. Do you want me to keep reading? What's that? "Dear Meg. If you're reading this, it means you're trying to solve my last treasure hunt. I'm glad. Perhaps that means at least part of you wants to forgive me. I'm sorry that there's so much distance between us. I know it's my fault, always chasing the next thing, never taking the time to appreciate what I had. But I hope that the hunt has reawakened some of your love for Lakewood and reminded you of the good times. Perhaps you've even figured out how that locket fits into all of this, the one I hid for you under the garden dweller at the river outlook. I had to make the treasure hunt very simple. Did you think it was beneath me? There's more to it than meets the eye. I love you. Dad." You okay? Yeah, I will be. Here, maybe something jumps out at you. Here, when he writes about the locket, "There's more to it than meets the eye." Let's take a closer look. See, but then he writes here, "You were so young. I had to make the treasure hunt very simple. Did you think it was beneath me?" Wait, do you think he means literally beneath him? There's only one way to find out. Hey, look. It's a series of engraved numbers. They're pushed together in groups, almost like a a phrase. "Wherever your heart is, find your home." What's that? It's the Larson family motto. Look, it fits, including the dash and the period there. Wherever your heart. It does. Yeah. So, so what now? We line the letters to the numbers on the locket and then we match those values to the peculiar series of letters in the Zack Larson journal. Okay, I'm just gonna line these up here and we should... Ah, something's missing. Look. Zach repeated periods here and here and the dash here. You're a genius. I like to think so. Wait. What does that look like to you? Are those? Coordinates. Okay, let me just look these up. They lead to the center of town, Tom. That means the treasure is still out there. I never doubted you for a second. Okay, I doubted you for a couple seconds, but I never lost hope. Okay, I lost hope for a little bit, but we did it. We saved the farm. Oh. What? My mom. She's about to sign the contracts with Royce on the steps of the library at noon. ♪ Oh, gotta get to you now ♪ ♪ Meet you somehow, someway ♪ ♪ Oh, you fly through heaven ♪ Nice. Good stash. Good morning, June. Poncho? Goggles? Yes. You and I both know that those crushed tomatoes somehow work their way underneath everything. They sure do. You know what? I'd better put my cell phone in the car. You should do that. All right. More goggles over here. Thank you, sir. Come on, mom. Come on, come on. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Today's the day, today's the day. It should be just around here. The statue? Can it really be that easy? You're due for a win. Just, um, check for hidden compartments? Okay. The boot, it's hollow. What? I'd say that looks like the treasure of Lakewood, don't you? How much do you think that's worth? The farm, with plenty leftover. Let's go find Royce. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, everyone! Welcome to this year's annual Tomato Toss! But just remember to have fun and play- - Ah, finally. Could this wait? I just would like a little time to enjoy the festival. No, I'm sorry. I need to get outta here and back to civilization ASAP. Here we go! In three... Two... There's June! One! Mom! We can just hurry this along. I'm not in the habit of just signing anything without reading it. Oh, no need to read all of this. It's just standard legal jargon. You can sign right there. Mom! Mom! There's no way she's gonna hear you through all this. There's only one way through. Don't you dare drop that ruby. This is a century of family legacy I'm parting with, so if I could just have a moment. Please. Mom! Mom! What the? Don't sign! We found it! It worked. You know, I think maybe the farm is best kept in the family. Thank you very much for your offer. Don, call me back. We found the treasure. Hey. Thank you. We did it together. Just think, next year this'll all be your tomatoes. Well, this is officially the worst town in America. Hope you found what you're looking for. I did. And I hope you do, too, whether that's the resort or whatever. Just won't be in Lakewood. Tom. Take care of her. Take care of each other. Look. We found the treasure of Lakewood. Oh, you found it. Oh, it's remarkable. We did it. As a team. You know when you see something like this in person, you see how it could cause so much strife. Well now it could be used for something good. Agreed. Now if you all will excuse me, I didn't get to throw any tomatoes. I'm gonna go fix that. You know, you are quite the treasure hunter. Your dad would be proud. Yeah, well, I think I found the best treasure in Lakewood. And I'm not talking about the ruby.
