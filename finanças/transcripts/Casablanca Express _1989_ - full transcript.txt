Second World War On November 8, 1942... Allied forces landed in North Africa... and occupied Casablanca, Algiers and Oran... which until then were in the hands of pro-German Vichy France. The French commander Admiral Darlan... He offered only token resistance... and immediately declared his willingness to collaborate with the allies... before being murdered on Christmas Eve, 142. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill... and American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt... agreed to hold a summit in Casablanca on January 15, 143. The code name of the meeting was "Operation Symbol". Their goals were to smooth things over... among the various French liberation movements... commanded by Generals De Gaulle and Giraud... and decide the strategist of the allies to win the war in Africa and Europe. Churchill's plane took off from London on the night of January 12. He wanted to get to Casablanca on time to make sure... Every effort was being made to make the meeting a success. But Churchill's journey proved more difficult than he expected... Mr. Pound! Mr. Pound! Instead of giving us heat... I have the impression that they intend to roast us. Turn off that thing! I prefer to die frozen. The stoves are going to explode. Excuse me, sir. Turn off the stove, cabo! What happen? Sorry sir. Our escort has engaged enemy aircraft. To avoid further danger, Algiers seems to be the best destination. Okay, but the enemy is not the only danger. Welcome to Algiers, sir. Firm! Rest! Say hello! To headquarters! It would be a grave mistake to disparage the German Intelligence Service. I don't think those German fighters knew... that I was on that plane, General Williams. But you have to eliminate the heating system. Oh Lord! It was just an improvised invention... to try to make his trip more pleasant. I appreciate your sense of humor, Colonel Bats. Mister! In short, the rest of your trip must be done with great care. I will put a squadron of fighters at your disposal from tomorrow. Please understand, General, that I cannot continue Operation Symbol... with an escort of American fighters. Now we are in French territory and only two hours from Casablanca. Sir, many Arabs regard the Axis forces as their liberators. His life is in great danger. Yes, I know. Yesterday my doctor reminded me a few times in Downing Street. He wants me to quit smoking. No place in Africa is safe... and many of my countrymen remain loyal to Petain. Major Valmore, whom I fully trust... he will be responsible for his security within French territory. Major Valmore, Mr. Cooper is... one of the best counter-espionage agents we have in Africa. Despite his youth. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. The Command has recommended Captain Franchetti to accompany him. He has an enormous responsibility, Captain. Major Valmore is in charge of Mr. Churchill's security... while he is in French territory. You two will cooperate with him. Shall we sit down, gentlemen? Please. I heard the Nazis already knew that Churchill was here... and that they plan to arrive in Casablanca. You should leave as soon as possible. Mr. Churchill doesn't want our planes escorting him. And a British squad would take days to get here. If it is kept secret... I could go on a fighter plane. Yes, but you cannot trust the native staff at this airport. Mr. Churchill could decide the time of departure... and tell us an hour before take off. What is not known, cannot be told. That sounds like an insult to this Command. Well, it frees us all from responsibility. In agreement. Why don't we go get some sleep? Yes, it may be the best solution. Good evening, gentlemen. Better said, good morning. A message, sir. Very good, General. I'm just going to give you one hour. If the animals know that I am here, we must take all precautions. They know it's here and, in fact, they want to make it public. This has come by radio. Will this affect your obligations to me? No sir. But nevertheless, you would like to know if it is true. No, only if possible. It's true, in a way. He had a spy in Japan, who he was able to communicate to us at the end of November... that three Japanese aircraft carriers were heading to Hawaii... where the most logical target was Pearl Harbor. I understand. General! Here he says: '' The Nazis say there that I was the one who involved them in this war... by not informing you of that Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. I knew that we should enter into this fight. We just wait too long. I agree with you, General. My brother was in Pearl Harbor in Arizona. Has he already gotten up, Lieutenant? Hey! This will wake us both up, Lieutenant. How bad are you! You are a bastard. I only have one hour to sleep. It is not the only thing to do in bed. So it's true. You only think about my body. Why not? We are in war. Tomorrow may be late. It can be important. Forget the phone! Listen! Listen! Listen! Say? What happen? Lorna? No, I'm not Lorna. Hey, Franchetti, I'll see you there. Where? Don't ask stupid questions and go there. But... Dear... I hope nobody else bothers us. Honey, we can't. We have to be there at. We must hurry. Oh no, Alan! Okay, it will take just a minute. If you're done, we can go. I'm almost done. Now! They come out! It is a trap! You notify the military police, I'll see what I can do in the meantime. -Something interesting? -Do not know. Anyway, good job. Is one hour enough time? Yes Sir, I think so. What time will it explode? Two hours after putting her on the plane. -What is he saying? -That someone is coming. Don't move, Otto Von Tiblis! Do I know him? -Are you OK? -Yes. Here we go! Chase them! Your weapon, sir. Mr. Churchill awaits our conclusions before deciding. Are you sure that German was referring to Churchill's plane? Sure, General. Otto Von Tiblis is the head of the German Intelligence in Africa. There is no doubt that the enemy knows that the Prime Minister is here... and that he will be gone soon. Are there possibilities to postpone the operation? No, not to mention. President Roosevelt has already started Operation Symbol... at least his part. Sit down. Knowing Mr. Churchill, he will attend that meeting. Even if I have to walk. And why not by train? It is twenty hours of travel through mountains and desert. The Germans would have time to organize. There have never been incidents on that line, but... There is always a first time. And we must trust that this news does not leave this room. Are you hinting that one of us could be a spy? Exactly! Colonel Del Croix and his assistant have shown us their loyalty and... and his hatred of Vichy France. And there is no need to worry about the rest of us. Is there a sleeper on that train? We can hook up a sleeping car. Then, sir, I'll report to Mr. Churchill. Ah! And this time, for God's sake, no impromptu heating. Come on, let's take care of the train. I suggest that Mr. Churchill's double come out at the same time. Good idea! Do not think that we have changed our plans! Come in, General. Fancy a glass of excellent vintage cognac? No, thank you, sir. Has the Colonel already informed you of the change in plans? -What about the train? -Yes. A curious idea. It is quite a long journey. But it's sure. All right, General. I'll be on his train. I will personally take care of the security measures. If I don't see you again, Lord, have a good trip. General, please. We informed President Roosevelt on December 2nd. He replied that he was aware of the Japanese ships... because a submarine had located them. However, he did not consider that they planned a surprise attack. Excuse me, Sir, but I prefer to think that the President was not informed. - And good? -Everything seems normal. -It hurts? -Do not. What I can't understand is because he didn't finish me off. You seem disappointed. Saving the enemy's life is nothing like the Nazis. I will take a look. Excuse me, could you take care of this girl for five minutes? I have to pick up some medical supplies from the station dispensary. -Vera... -It's only five minutes. -Yes, of course. -Thanks. What is your name? Miriam. Vera, she is Jewish. The Germans killed her family. You speak my language? -Where are you from? -From Warsaw. My congratulations. Good figure and the perfect weight. That's what they all tell me. Come on, Olga! Move on! -I'm heavier. -My name is Jason Lloyd. I am Olga and the heavy one is Liz. Leave it, Olga... it was a manner of speaking. Excuse me, please. We remind you that it is forbidden to travel without a ticket. We remind you that it is forbidden to travel without a ticket. -Want one? -Yes. Don't bother about her. Say '' No thanks '', Miriam. No, thanks. Thanks. Come on, Miriam. Gentlemen travelers are reminded that the train will leave in 20 minutes... Lower your head, you idiot! Leave your luggage here. Captain Jerry Fraser, sir. I am responsible for your safety. Excuse me for not getting up, but you could see us from outside. I know, Captain, although I find it quite ridiculous. You will travel with a detachment of soldiers, sir. All Americans, unfortunately. Don't be so hard on them, Colonel. If not for them, we would all speak German. I have installed a radio transmitter on the train. We will be in permanent contact. Everything seems calm, Captain, despite the short notice. -When have you been given the orders? -Half an hour ago. Two copies of the Times. I do not know what I would be without them. Even if they are from a week ago. Be careful with my luggage! What happens here? My God! I have my game of you inside. You are an idiot! British! They believe they are the masters of the world. They receive their education from their mother. There is Cooper. He keep his eyes open. What could happen on this pleasure trip? Excuse me, I have to check one thing. I'll see you in a couple of days. During the course we were taught to be suspicious... of which you would never think of suspecting. None of the travelers strike me as a murderer... so they may all be suspicious. Wow, Franchetti! If your instructor is right, you will win the Nobel Prize for intelligence. I do not understand. I know, don't worry. Travelers to the train! Travelers to the train! -Good-bye, Lord. -Ah, bye! I have just been informed that the plane took off a couple of minutes ago. According to the plan. Well well. All in order? If I just spoke to HQ. Good. Are you in constant contact? We exchange messages every half hour. May Ala accompany you. Thanks, brother, but we prefer another company. Ala means God. My mother was from Malta... where the Christian God is also called Ala. I don't think he cares too much about names. Who knows... All in order. Do you have children? He and I? Well, we're not even married. You can have children without being married. Yes, I know, but no... we are not... Miriam, stop bothering people. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Has the Casablanca Expres already been released? A few minutes ago, sir. At the exact time. Wow! They told me I would be late today... because they had to hitch a special wagon. That's right, Lord. We cleaned it up this morning. This morning? Fine thanks. I think Petain did what he should have done. He saved half of France from being destroyed by the Germans. But it destroyed the alliance with the English. He collaborated with the Nazis. You better shut up! Whose side is your dad on, huh? You are collaborating with the fascists! They should cut off his head! It would not be the first time. Saint Peter was crucified as Christ. If Christ returned, would he collaborate with the fascists? Are you not on Petain's side? Please, gentlemen, we still have a long way to go to reach Casablanca. If they start like this, what will the rest of the trip be like? I think it refers to me. Do you mind repeating what she said in my language? -Who are you? -A snooper. With a gun. What he wants? He was just giving me his job report. This morning he received the order... to hitch a special wagon to the Casablanca Expres. Who gave the order? Not this morning. The order arrived only one hour before the train's departure. However, Charlie and his little friends cleaned it up this morning. Routine. I do not believe it. I think they put a bomb on that train. Okay, call the first station. Tell them to stop you and evacuate you. Are you crazy? Crazy and very dangerous. Do it! Now! No, sir, no! What have they done to the train? Nothing, sir, we haven't done anything. I swear. We just clean and prepare the car. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order? Major Valmore. I have to see General Williams right now. -Are you Alan Cooper? -Yes. You're under arrest, friend. I can not believe it. They tell me you killed a French agent. I shot someone who wanted to kill me. Hey, the only thing that matters is that train. The station employees knew about the special car this morning. Not impossible! Churchill decided to go on that train two hours before leaving. Yes, but the idea was Valmore's. Is he saying that he is a traitor? The train is a trap. He has to stop it! I don't think we should take any risks. They caught him, okay. He not only plays soldier, he is a German spy. He entered the station control booth... he killed one of my men... and tried to get the controller to stop the Casablanca Express. General, we are wasting time. Stop the train! It can explode at any time, while you decide which is the spy. The train has left Sidi bel Abbes on time. I don't know why Mr. Cooper tries so hard to stop the train. But if he wants to, Lord... I can order a full inspection at the next station. Tlemcen. It will arrive in two hours. It seems that two hours is enough to carry out Major Valmore's plans. Stop! It's enough, Cooper! I can't stop it in the mountains. I must wait for it to reach Tlemcen. Communicate with the Casablanca Expres. You two will have to stay here. Major Valmore and Mr. Cooper must not leave this building... until new order. -Did you hear that? -The fact that? I'll see. I will take a look. Help! Someone help me! Help me! Come on, take me! It's bleeding. Are you okay, Julian? -Take care of him. -Yes, yes, I'm fine. Make way! Make way! Captain Fraser, there is a murderer on the train! Did you say a murderer? There was a man on the roof! He could throw a grenade into the Prime Minister's compartment... or blow up the whole train. We must catch him! We have received radio orders a long time ago. We will be in Tlemcen shortly. There we will search all the wagons. It could be late, Captain. Don't add more charcoal. We stopped in Tlemcen. Schneller! Keep adding charcoal! More coal! Or he will meet his friend. Schneller! Call Headquarters. Say there are problems. Yes sir. The train is accelerating. You and you! Follow me! Hey! Get on the coals and let me know if you see someone coming. I do not see anyone! Down! Are you OK? Yes? Well, they say that there is no harm that does not come good! Whenever you want. Come on, Olga, sit down. It's not my fault he fell on me, Liz. Please don't touch my things! Look at this handsome! With love, Arthur. Whose Arthur is this? Barry, do you want to help me? I'm here, Julian. Please don't be hysterical. Do not say stupid things. I can not contact. There is too much interference in the mountains. How are you? Do not worry about me. Thanks. There is contact, sir! We are slowing down! Go to Churchill. Who are you? Excuse me, sir. I'm Lieutenant Lorna Fisher. -But that it does? -I should ask you to stoop. There is a saboteur on the train. Hey, watch out! German paratroopers attack us! They attack us! Vornaers! Schnell! Careful! To your battle stations! Germans! Be careful! They are going to kill us! You are the target. They are taking a lot of trouble. It is clear that they want me alive. Oh no! She's dead! She's dead, Father! Is everything okay, Lord? Yes, I think so, apart from the sharp edges of this suitcase. Let's get out! Barry! Barry! No, Miriam! Miriam! Oh, Miriam! They hit him on the shoulder. Nani! Miriam! We have to shut down that machine gun. Let's get out of here! I can not stand it anymore! Achtung! Nobody move! Nobody move, I said! OMG! Shut up! This is crazy! We are civilians! Five men with me to Churchill's compartment! You guys cover us! No one should get off the train! We need help. We are attacked by paratroopers. We are in trouble! Take the radio! Hands up! Are you looking for me? Sir Churchill, you are the private prisoner of the Furer. ...prisoner. At dawn a German plane will enter Algerian airspace... and land near the train. We are mining the train. Any action that tries to prevent our plan. cause an immediate detonation... resulting in the death of Sir Churchill and all passengers. Major Valmore! You are a traitor to France! Vichy France is with the Third Reich. You are the traitor! He will be subjected to a court martial and shot. Death is part of the life of a soldier. Remember that when it's your turn. You were right, Mr. Cooper. But there was not enough evidence. I understand, General. But Von Tbilis' plan is very ingenious. He led me to the Medina... to make us believe that he intended to fly Churchill's plane... and so, with the help of Valmore, we opted for the idea of ​​the train and... He caught the Prime Minister alive. We cannot let Hitler take the Prime Minister to Berlin. He sure prefers to die. I understand the British point of view, Colonel. But that train also carries about 100 passengers... and briefcases with documents that should never fall into your hands. But Lord... General, if we allow Hitler to take Mr. Churchill to Berlin... he will display it as if he were a circus animal. The morale of our troops will drop. And let alone the honor of England! Excuse me, with all due respect. Churchill's death is as unthinkable as his imprisonment. Do not? A train full of Marines has already left Casablanca... In the direction of that damn trap. But he has orders to do nothing, and stay there, 6 kilometers away... Until we find a way to stop that train from flying. There's a chance. If you have any plans, say so. I will need special equipment. How many men? Only me. Colonel, did I hear correctly? Cooper... Alan, this is a desperate and extremely dangerous situation. I doubt that you are only capable of... I know I can do it, Lord. Cooper is our expert in impossible operations. Furthermore, we have no other choice. What is his plan? Cancel the vias. When he's done... I'll send them a radio signal and they can attack en masse. All right, Cooper. If you can't catch him alive, kill him. Send the signal and the Marines will come. Take a position 200 meters from the train. If you hear the noise of engines, shoot into the air. - Do you think they tried something? -What would you do instead? Obey the Furer. Better to die than to be taken prisoner. I think they will agree with you. If they send paratroopers, we'll hear the planes. Do not worry about me. Take care of the girl. There is no way to get off the train. Poor dear! You need a doctor! It is urgent! If we don't get the bullet out, he will die. -Does anyone know about medicine? -I can't move my hand. I have helped friends of mine to abort. I mean the blood doesn't impress me. May God have mercy on you, daughter. I once removed an abscess. Let's see what we can do. I need more light. Take it in there. This should serve as an anesthetic and disinfectant. The pilot of the plane, Sir, has just crossed the coast. His expected arrival time is 3:15. He asks for confirmation. In agreement. Situation under control. Landing 20 km east of Tlemcen, as stipulated. As soon as it has dawned. Follow the train track and you will find us. What's the weather like in Berlin? I don't know, sir. I'm from Vienna, sir. -Do you smoke, young man? -Yes sir. So can you give me fire? Or is that considered collaborating with the enemy? Immediately Mr. Do you think we are so stupid? Sir Churchill, you have been an accessory to his attempted escape. I warn you: there is an order to kill him if he tries to do the same. He won't dare. Uncle Adolfo wants me alive. He could no longer escape, Fraulein. Do not! We would all fly. It was about time you arrived. I am alone. Does it hurt a lot? Yes, a lot. Hey, I need your help. They appear to have placed dynamite under each wagon. I have managed to cut a couple of cables there behind... but I need you to help me and cut the rest. -You can do it? -Yes. Hey! Do you feel like it, soldier? Use the pliers. How's it going? It's almost over, honey. Just one more moment. I know it hurts a lot. I'm going to need silk for the stitches. Here is a needle. Thanks. Look, this is silk! If they only knew what I went through to get these stockings. Olga! Not seriously. Glad to be helpful. Yes. -Can do it? -Yes. Thanks. This will hurt, but not much. Miriam, don't yell! If you scream they will hear us. I'm screaming inside Go! They will be back soon! That's it! Alan! Go! Thanks god. A little more and she could have been a mother. -You've known how to distract him. -How did you get here? By plane to Tlemcen and then by camel. Alarm! Alarm! The girl has escaped! Schnell! Schnell! She is dead. The enemy is here. I don't know how they got there, but they must be inside the train. Franchetti is under the train... cutting off explosive charges. The Americans will only attack when they receive a radio signal. -If not, Churchill is over. -It seems. The radio is inside. All you have to do is turn the crank. Once done, it will send out a fixed signal. He gets back on the train. If Franchetti has succeeded, he turns the crank. He turns it on even though he doesn't get it. Bats said that Churchill would rather die than be taken prisoner. I don't know if it's true, but he gives the orders. It will be dawn soon. I will distract them. You go back to the train. Oh, and don't entertain any more soldiers! Do not even say it! Be careful! I'll see you later on the train. The German plane is going to enter our anti-aircraft range. Send the fighters! Squadrons 1 and 2. Ready to shoot. If the German plane feels threatened, it could be the end. Oh no no no! We only offer you an escort. There! Catch him alive! He is alone! Hands on your head! Mr. Cooper. Let me out! Let me out! Nerd! Let me pass! Careful! Hurry! Follow me! Above! Go Go! Out of! Out of! -Have you found her? -No, Herr Oberst. What the hell is going on in there? A man has tried to kill me, Herr Oberst. He has forced me to shoot. I told you not to kill civilians, you idiot! We have to find that blonde! Get him up! Is it true that Adolf Hitler fucks your fucking mother? I am going to kill you! But first you will tell me how you got here... and what the Americans are planning. Here, you will know how to handle it! What's that? A radio. Send an S.O.S. In the meantime, we will have to do the work ourselves. There is. It is within our reach. A sign, Lord! It is received clear and strong. That Cooper is a lion. Or a fox. I am General Williams. Let's go to Plan 2. Warn the antiaircraft and fighters. I want that plane to disappear. Green cross to the Marines. Prepare a plane, I'm going to Tlemcen. There is an airstrip around here. Here exactly. They see him? I know that the English prefer tea But you can't have everything in life. How did you get here? Like an Arab. How did you get here? By camel. What orders does he have? Kill you all and leave Churchill. A message from Berlin! They shot down the plane! The Furer's personal orders are to blow up the train. Let go of him! Inside! Inside! Don't shoot, no! OMG! -Go! -I'm good. Heil Hitler! Fuck it, Hitler! Kill Churchill! Thanks. He don't move! Try this! Be careful, stop! We are going to kill each other! Ready to shoot! ld for them! He is dead. Come on, come on, hurry! Alan! Don't worry, I'll take care of him. Register the train! Go! Churchill is in the third car! Call the doctor to attend to the injured, quickly! You are a very brave girl. And that man saved your life. Will he also get an injection? Sure, it's a new medicine. Can you raise the dead? No, but it cures practically everything. Has he hurt you? Yes, he should have done it. What's that? It is not an easy name to remember. Penicillin. Excuse me, is there a Catholic chaplain here? Do not. Come with me please. Are you feeling better? I wish... to confess... father... But not me... You can do it. First make the sign of the Cross on your forehead... and then he repeat with me... '' I absolve you... in the name of the Father... and of the Son... And of the holy spirit... And may Ala be with you, brother. Go Go! To form! Say hello! Sergeant, this is 121! -All in order? -Yes sir. Thanks. Could you also thank me Mr. Churchill. He already will, but not now. I'm going to recommend you for a medal and a vacation. But Churchill, the real Churchill, has been in Casablanca since yesterday. The Prime Minister changed his mind at the last minute... And he decided to go by plane and let his double catch the train. Shit, General! Shit! Franchetti is dead. And also many other people. We had to save Churchill, and we did. Surely he thinks the secret job is dangerous and fraudulent. But without that, a lot of real action would be borage water. Good work! Go! January 14, 1943 Skirmish with German saboteurs near Tlemcen. Military and civil casualties. (excerpt from the archives of the Allied Headquarters in Algiers)
