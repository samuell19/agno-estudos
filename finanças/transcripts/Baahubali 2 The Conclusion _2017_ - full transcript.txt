Have you everthought... of killing your mother? l wanted to do so lnstead of nursing only you when you were a newborn... she also nursed thatjackass. That was the 1st time l wanted to kill her. When she was sharing your name, fame, title, eligibility, everything with him. Every single day l was dying to kill her. Today when she is bequeathing the throne meant for you to that lowlife. This hand is trembling to strangle her. Bhalla? Shall we kill her? You have drunk more than your normal limit. Your mother's watchdog is coming. Hey! Bloody dog! - My lord? - What is your latest bark? Queen Sivagami has decided to crown Baahubali as king... on the 10th day of 'Dussehra' Queen Mother wanted you to be the 1st recipient of this news. History repeats itself! The throne meant for me was given to my younger brother! Now you are bequeathing the throne meant for my son to my brother's son! Should my son, grandson, great grandson also... '...be fanning your ego through the ages' Are we your slaves for generations, huh? Dog, answer! Why was l not crowned as king then? Was it because l am disabled? So what if 1 hand is incapacitated? ls this 1 iron fist not enough to rule our kingdom? Kingship was denounced to you not because of the disability of your hand. Because of your dysfunctional brain! Command me, my lord. Dog! Are you not aware your razor tongue can be sliced into 2 for your insolence? Forgive me, my lord. The brain that wishes to kill a beloved wife... what else can it be but deformed and devious? - Did you overhear? - No, my lord. Since l am anyway a 'dog'... like a scent hound l could smell it! She is the princess of Pataliputra, Varuni. Even if you comb every corner of our world, you cannot find such a beauty. But her eyes look lifeless. She is not the right choice for Baahubali. - Look for another bride. - Sure, Your Majesty. Pundit. Keep this in mind. She will not only be Baahubali's wife. But also the queen of Mahishmati kingdom. She should be perfect without a single flaw. Mother, did you send for me? Baahu, you must take a tour of our entire kingdom. As you wish, mother. Queen Mother, with the coronation just around the corner... taking a tour now does not seem a good idea. Even deities from our temples are taken on a procession. Do you know why, minister? To behold the gladness and sadness of our subjects in person. Baahu, only when the future king steps outside the palace walls... he can understand the trials of his people. - Yes, mother. - Let Kattappa accompany you. Mother, do l have to take this old man also with me? The stories he narrated to me in my childhood... he will torture me by repeating the same. Think of it as the last time and bear with him, Baahu. By the time you return... l will find you a princess to narrate enchanting fairy tales! He is a thief. - Please forgive me. - lt has become a habit for him. Even at this age how are you so energetic? You seem surprised aboutjust this. The way l wielded a sword when l was your age... you know chaste maidens will be dumbfounded?! Those are bygone days. Pindari tribe. They plunder the whole kingdom. And then drowning people is their pastime l got wild elephants just for you to play with from the Dark Kingdom. On the banks of the river Pranahita... is the Spring palace l am building for you. Do you like it? l had this bow made for you to kill a target 1000 feet away. Mother...? Throne for my brother. These gifts for me. Are you trying to balance your love? Your son is not so petty minded to lament for not ascending the throne, mother. Queen Mother Sivagami Devi's command will be complied. Do not offer these gifts and degrade their value, mother. - Taste this sweet. - Alright, dear. You are a smart girl. Sir, who are you? He is showing off like a hero? Bandits...! These are soldiers in disguise to nab them. We do not have to strain ourselves. She brandishes the sword as fast as lightning. She is fighting well indee- By the way our hero seems to be missing in action? Where is he showing off his bravery- My lord. Go that side. - You go this side. - Yes, my lord. A few of you stay right here. Baahu...! Baahu, weapon. Throw. Baahu...? You are distracted, Baahu. Your sword could have easily sliced my neck l escaped death by a hair's breadth! l might have died, you know? l feel like l can do anything for her. Does it mean you can kill? That too, kill me?! Wretched fellow! How well l took care of you in your childhood?! You should do much more to unite us you know. - Madhava. - Your Highness. Trace their hideout. - We must retrieve the stolen goods. - Yes, Your Highness. Tie all of them. No one should escape. Tighten that knot. Long live, Your Highness! You were a godsend who saved us at the right time. May you always be blessed. Standing still like palm trees. Are you not ashamed to hide behind women? Forgive me, Your Highness. My nephew is a bit of a numbskull. Come here. He is not adept at any job. - He was driven out of his house. - What...? Yourfamily threw you out? Yes, Your Highness. You seem to be really compassionate lf you can kindly teach him some skill... he will utter your name until his last breath. So be it. For his robust appearance... if we train him in sword fighting he can at least become a guard l will teach him. Grateful, sir. Truly grateful. My dear nephew, look over there. 'Full moon night is fast approaching' 'We must pray to Lord Krishna' 'lt is purely a ladies' festival' 'You perform it as you deem fit' 'Why drag me into it, dear?' Your Highness, in our entire kingdom no one can beat you in archery. But still why are you not satisfied? Not enough, Prime minister. You cannot string 2 arrows from 1 bow, Your Highness. Prime minister, anything is possible for my sister. Try again, dear. Move aside. You keep forgetting she is a girl. Are we preparing her to be a bride or a brave warrior in the battlefield? Absolutely right, Your Majesty. Will you choose from the alliances at hand? Or shall we get you married to your cousin? 'lmbecile! l will show our armory to you, come' This is a mace lt cannot be lifted. This is a spear lt cannot be thrown. This is a sword l will teach you how to wield it. What do you excel in? Everything, my lord. Any ball game Tiger dance. Hide & Seek Drop The Handkerchief. What about hopscotch? l have watched from far But the girls did not include me. Forget that Look at me. Watch and learn. You should hold like this. - Lift it high. - Aiyo! Then 1 swift blow. Try your hand. You do not know, my dear boy. Kumara Varma is playing guru now, Your Highness l told you so! Hold it. Lift it above your head. Like this. - What a blow, my lord. - Did l?! Of course you Who else, my lord? l did it. Monitor lizard's tight grip. 'Bull's blow' 'Eagle's keen eyes' 'Elephant's might' Tiger's body Panther's speed. 'Lion's magnificence' l can see the entire jungle in you, my lord. - My lord. - l like you 'l shall teach you also to wield the sword' 'For me?' Why this drama for a princess of such a small kingdom? lf you reveal your identity she will worship you immediately. What is this drama in aid of? To a 60 year old man who is still single... how do l enlighten him about love? Do not simply let yourtongue run, Baahu. Describe love to me and if l still do not understand, then ridicule me. Look at the birds on the branch in this cold wintry night. The moon shining in herfull glory. Having their fill of the moonlight scattered on the silken petals down there. Watching them caress and feed each other with affection. What do you feel? Having lived on this earth for all these years... l have never enjoyed anywhere, anytime lf we catch these 2 love birds, marinate with salt and pepper. Roast them in a low fire at simmer and eat them. Sheer heaven! What is wrong with you? You will not chop after sunset, huh? My lord? Princess Devasena is coming to see you. Welcome, Devasena lf you should meet me at this time of the night... there must be a special reason. My dear cousin l was unable to watch your brave feat in the morning. Will you demonstrate now? How can l get a log of wood now? lt is right there. Oh look! lt was hidden there. You found it, huh? Good you found this. But where is my sword- Overthere. Move a few paces away. Stop... stop, my lord lf a brave warrior like you... repeats the same feat at night it is considered a bad omen. Are you not aware of this? Why not? l forgot. You reminded me at the right time. We will go hunting tomorrow. Wild pigs are ruining our field- - Pigs are dirty creatures. - Not pigs. - Wild boars. - As bad as pigs. Our farmers are troubled by these boars ravaging our fields. Bring him also. - Er... um... wait! - Even a rat will make him scurry. Why do you want to take him along? He is stuck to you all the time lf he accompanies us only then l will know. How useful he will be. - Bring him along. - Yes, Your Highness. Look! A wild boar. Boar. - Do not fall over me. - You ki-killed it. Blue arrow lt is Kumara Varma's Kumar Varma killed the wild boar!! Kumara Varma did it again! Slowly. Wi... wild boar. Will it be so huge? So fat, huh? Dead center! You were too good! Arrow of Varma is like arrow of Lord Rama. Long live Kumara Varma l have never seen such a brave warrior. What accuracy of aim! He is a seasoned hunter. Amazing! Kumar Varma's bravery Unsurpassed glory! Singlehanded he killed a sounder of boars! Pig-hogger! Such a hog! Pig... hog... boar! - l hate flattery. - l know only too well. Devasena, we must preserve these arrows lt will be a lesson of faith to disciples of archery. What a vision-ary! l had my own doubts the 1st day l set my eyes on you. Your acting skill. And his extra meekness. - Me? - Does not look like that. What did you say your name was? Shi-Shiva. Hooked her! This hand is adept at wielding a sword in the battlefield. Do l not know a warrior's hand? She is saying something. Aiyaiyo! What are you saying? Poor fellow He is a simpleton! Let me be the judge of that. Bring 'Basava' here. 'What is this, Your Highness?' 'A man who cannot even lift a twig to brush his teeth...' if you give such a huge spear what can he do? What are you trying to prove? Hey! What is happening? The bull is charging towards this coward. Wonder what will happen. Dear God, help him. Aiyaiyo! My nephew has been killed. What injustice meted out to a boy who has not yet seen the flush of youth! ls it a fracture? lt is over, doomsday for him! Who will marry him hereafter? Which girl will be ready to fall in love with him? - Who is that big hearted princess? - Stop it! Bring the chariot. 'Aiyo! What will l do now?' 'Oh God! Help me' The angel who promised to help has broken his arm. Lord... God, show mercy. Can you get up? lmbecile! Can you not hear him? Get up. Adjust the pillow. Give him this brew at once lf he sleeps well tonight, he will be right as rain. Writhing in agony like this how can you expect him to sleep? The God l believe in...! - Oh! Please. - Lullaby? You want someone to sing you a lullaby? Where will l find someone to sing you a lullaby now? Do you know to sing a lullaby? - You do not know? - No. - What about you? - l cannot sing. Neither can you, huh? Your Highness. Do you sing? Aiyo!! Ever since my nephew broke his arm... like a headless chicken l do not know what l am blabbering. Dear God whom l believe in, help me! 'However off-key and jarring it may sound, l will do the honors!' "To shower words tender he has no mother." "No father either to comfort him here" "l wonder who is here, near to shed a few teardrops dear?" My dear, can you hear my soulful lament here? "Like the moon single and lovely you were also born on this earth lonely." "Wonder who is here so dear to ask if he was hurt severe?" Are you still in your hunting attire? Please come, it is time now for Lord Krishna's prayer. "Blue-hued Lord Mukunda Lord of the senses, Hrishikesha." "Mukunda, the liberator of everyone Whose hair is adorned by moon and sun."

"Radha's lover dearest Lord with the peacock feathered crest." "Thief of my heart, take rest." Baahubali and Kattappa are in Kunthala kingdom now. Baahubali is pretending to be a blockhead. Why should a blockhead pretend to be one? Why is he doing so? Baahubali may be in love with Devasena the princess of Kunthala kingdom. This is a portrait of Devasena. He gets to sit on the throne and marry such a beauty! Devasena should belong only to me. How is it possible? lf my mother gives her word. How can she promise you will marry the beauty your brother is in love with? She is unaware of the fact my brother is interested in her l intend making the 1st move. Bhalla...? Neither did you come for breakfast. Nor attend court like you do. - Why, Bhalla? - Nothing, mother l did not feel like coming l know what is happening, Queen Mother. What is the issue? Maleficent 'Vaastu' - Architectural imbalance? - Yes, Your Majesty. The south east corner has become heavy suddenly. - Do you want to see? - No need, Yakkani. Bhalla...? l am telling you now. Show me. The most beautiful lady who will put beauty to shame! Who is she? Princess of Kunthala kingdom Her name is Devasena. A nomadic artist gifted this painting to our prince. That very same instant... north east corner gained favor in his heart. Are you so besotted with this princess, Bhalla? Yes, mother l want her as my wife. What is this, Your Highness? lf you want her... will she become yours? Why not? ln the blink of an eye... my son sacrificed the throne of Mahishmati kingdom lf l cannot give him the princess he has set his heart upon... how can l call myself a mother? Bhalla. Devasena will be your wife l give you my word. Prime minister ln such a way these ornaments are not worn again for a whole year... send caskets with varied jewelry as gifts to Devasena. - Your wish is my command. - Dandanayaka. Send clothes in spun gold to the royal family of Kunthala kingdom. At once, Queen Mother. Royal sword of Bhallaldev. Minister...? Make Devasena tie a knot to this sword. - Let the alliance be finalized. - Your command, Your Majesty. Make arrangements for my daughter-in-law to be welcomed... with royal fanfare amidst pomp and splendor. 'With blessings to vassal king Jaya Varma of Kunthala kingdom...' '...Sivagami, Queen Mother of Mahishmati the renowned kingdom, writes herewith' 'For my son, fed with bravery, knowledge, love, affection and good values' 'l have chosen your sister Devasena as his life partner' 'Congratulations' 'Send Devasena to Mahishmati at once' 'By the time you return...' 'l will find you a princess to narrate enchanting fairy tales!' Mother has chosen the same girl the son is in love with. 'Yours truly, Queen Mother Sivagami Devi' To seek alliance with Mahishmati kingdom... when so many powerful empires are queuing up ever so eagerly. Queen Mother's compassionate gaze has fallen on your small territory Princess is indeed fortunate. Look at the trousseau Queen Mother has sent to seek your sister's hand. You would have never set eyes upon such wealth and valuables in your life ls itjust you and your Queen Mother? Or is everyone in your kingdom like this? Looking at these riches... you may wag your tail like a dog. This is equivalent to dust under my feet! - Devasena...! - Minister lf your prince had even an ounce of this arrogance... l would have been glad he is also a man! ln our kingdom, a wimp like him. Forget our girls. Even our dogs will not favor! - Devasena...? - Bravo, Your Highness! Your Majesty, at least can you persuade- lt is her decision, Prime minister. You send a befitting reply, Devasena. Write this down. To Sivagami Devi, Queen Mother of Mahishmati kingdom... greetings from the princess of Kunthala kingdom lnstead of seeking my hand in person courageously... '...by sending mere gifts' '...l learnt about your son's bravery' '...and the fact he needs a woman like you to hide behind' l am sending you my sword. Bedeck your son with gold and preciousjewelry. 'Ensure he ties the knot to my sword' 'Send him to Kunthala kingdom' 'l will take good care of him' With utmost humility, Devasena. - Prime minister...! - Queen Mother...? We will wage a war against Kunthala kingdom right now. - Ask our army commander to be ready. - Sivagami...! Why is a divine weapon needed to kill a mere sparrow? l heard Baahubali is somewhere around Kunthala kingdom lf you send word to him, he will crush that kingdom to pieces singlehandedly. And he will bring Devasena as his prisoner l stretched out my hand seeking amity. They seem to want enmity. Ask Baahubali to bring Devasena as captive to Mahishmati. Send word to him as Sivagami's command. As you order, Queen Mother lf she could reject such a worthy alliance in an outburst of rage... do you understand how much she loves me? But, my Lord, the princess seems to be singing lullabies forthat blockhead... is what l heard from my grapevine in the harem. - That blockhead? - Yes, my lord. Bring the elephants to trample him. Baahu, a piece of good news and a piece of bad news too. - Which do l tell you first? - Tell me both l will decide which is good or bad. Queen Mother has sent a message asking you to marry Devasena. Will my mother not know what l like best? But the princess however... has rejected the proposal angrily. This is also good news. Good news? Having fallen in love with this 'me' she would have rejected that 'me'! Maama.. Weapon. You imbecile! A man who scurried like a rat is prowling like a tiger today. Where are you going? - To the princess's chamber. - What audacity! You want to meet Devasena at this time of night? Why? This kingdom is in danger, Kumara Varma. - Listen to me. - You dare call me by my name! l do not have time to explain. Move aside. How dare you lay your hand on me! They are bandits, Pindaris. Sound the alarm. Look! Shiva Shiva...! Shiva, save us. They are here too. Kumara Varma. Time offers every spineless man a minute to become a brave warrior. That minute is ticking now. God creates life. The physician saves it. One who protects that life... is a true Kshatriya! Your Highness, Four fingers. Turn the wrist facing outward. Release. Braveheart Who are you? This is not the right time for explanations, let us go. 'We are all mere cowherds, sir' 'How can we fight?' 'lf you fight intelligently even a blade of grass will be an arrow!' 'Army alone is not enough to oppose them' 'Your kingdom needs every helping hand' '-Are you ready? - - Yes, we are' "Ever loyal and dependable Lord of miracles, mystical." "He vanquishes the wicked as Lord Shiva." "Hail the 3 eyed Lord Tryambaka Ash clad monarch of Mount Kailasa" 'Demonstrate your strength' 'Godspeed' 'Praise be to Goddess Bhavani' Climb up. Fix the hooks below. Saranga! Not knowing your real identity l spoke out of turn l kicked you on your chest. Only when you stamped me l realized how strong you are! This is not blood, Kumara Varma. A mark of victory pronouncing you as a warrior and not a coward. You saved us like God from an unexpected peril. Who are you? Where are you from? What does it matter who he is? We came believing only you can help us. This brave warrior needs help from me- He is... in love with a girl from your kingdom ls that so? Who is that lucky maiden? She is... er- Your... princess. What more joy can one ask for? 'What is the news?' What is it? Queen Mother Sivagami has ordered me to bring you to our kingdom as captive. Treachery. Your- Your Highness. Just a while ago we hailed you as a godsend and our savior. You have proved our gratitude was false. Tell me Who are you? Even a sweet will taste bitter when you are angry, Your Highness! Just answer my query Who are you? After this anger dissipates. Crown prince of Mahishmati kingdom. Son of Queen Mother Sivagami Devi. Bravest of braves, achieved the impossible by defeating the invincible Kalakeyas. Amarendra Baahubali. Affection between kith and kin will do. Why do we need respect? Queen Mother asked for Devasena's hand for you? Yes, Your Majesty. Queen Mother is unaware Baahubali loves your sister. Because you rejected her son she has sent for you in anger. My mother has never gone wrong, Devasena ln whatever she does, a deep inner meaning is bound to be hidden. This is an error based on confusion Not born out of contempt. Come with me as my prisoner. You are the brave warrior who won over my heart lf you ask me to come as your attendant l will gladly do so till the jaws of death. But disrobing me of my dignity not even one step as your captive... will l move forward. From this instant... till death embraces me l am yours, Devasena 'l promise this based on the Dharma my mother has instilled in me' 'l will not let your chastity and respect be tarnished in any way' 'l swear' We are sending our kingdom's light with you, Your Highness l shall protect her like the pupil of my eye. We will take leave Princess, you are not hurt, l hope. Your thoughts... are flitting elsewhere. "ln a kingdom illustrious Ruled a king so courageous" "ln a kingdom prestigious There was a king famous." "Let me be the queen of your kingdom." "Like your veena's melody boundless make me forever your precious princess" "ln a swan sailboat in tranquility when your breath falls on me" "l, Devasena, am reveling in this love-ly heavenly feeling." "Like your battlefield of conquest." "You fight in real earnest o' warrior invading my chest." "O' enchantress, a flash of lightning ride my heart like a chariot enlivening." "Are you a demon kissing me random with your sword holding me to ransom?" "Shall l show you my magic tricks seductress at the brink of your lips?" "Did he find a place his own solitary space?" "As a captive in your passionate embrace." "Shall l be your prisoner For 100 years and ever after?" "ln a kingdom illustrious Ruled a king so courageous" "ln a kingdom prestigious There was a king famous." "Let me be the queen of your kingdom." "Like your veena's melody boundless make me forever your precious princess" "ln a swan sailboat in tranquility when your breath falls on me" "l, Devasena, am reveling in this love-ly heavenly feeling." Do not worry about anything, Your Highness. Our Queen mother will take care of you as her own daughter. Mahishmati. Royal Court. Attention! l spoke out of turn and insulted you l should not have replied to you in haste angrily. Please forgive my arrogance, Queen Mother. For this Sivagami's daughter-in-law... a little bit of temerity is appealing indeed. Come and stand next to my son. Whether my selection was perfect or not... let the people of Mahishmati witness. Devasena...? What are you doing? You asked me to stand next to your- l chose you as bride for my son Bhallaldev. What...? The man l fell in love with and wished to marry... is Baahubali. What is happening here? Please forgive me, Queen Mother l made a huge blunder. The son you had referred to in your royal message... l mistook to be Baahubali l am responsible for all this chaos. Her Highness is not to blame. Kattappa. No point in dissecting the past. We need to focus only on our future. Queen Mother- Baahu l have given my word to your brother that he will marry Devasena. 'Stop it' Who are you to give your word for my marriage without my consent? Do you not know a princess has the right to choose her husband? Do you not possess even that courtesy? What audacity to raise your voice in front of me? Guards...! Tie this boorish girl and make her kneel. As you command, Queen Mother. A hand laid on Devasena... is equal to anyone touching Baahubali's sword. Mother l have given my word to Devasena to protect her dignity. Your Highness, are you the one confronting our Queen Mother? You always say 'Even Lord Shiva can make a mistake' 'But our Queen Mother's words can never go wrong' 'For a word given in good faith For upholding justice' 'To protect the code of Dharma oppose whoever the offender is' 'Even if it is God, do not be afraid' 'That is the Law of Dharma' 'Righteousness of the Kshatriya clan' Promising your son blindly not knowing a woman's heart is wrong. What you did was wrong, mother. What Sivagami did was wrong? What is wrong? You killed your mother when you entered this world. And she nursed you Was that wrong? 'She shared the fame and fortune of her son equally with you' 'Was that a crime?' She was happy to make you the crown prince. Was that a misdeed? lnstead of her son, she chose you of lesser worth to be crowned king. Was that wrong? 'Wrong doing!' Did you see that, Sivagami? Your sacrifice has been named by him as... misdeed. You must honor your promise. But your mother's word should vanish into thin air! 'So your mother's promise has no value or respect?' No need. The pearls of wisdom you spoke now... have fallen on deaf ears. Amarendra Baahubali...! You have 2 choices laid before you. Do you want to be the ruler of the resplendent kingdom of Mahishmati? Or do you wish to marry this manipulator Devasena? lf l choose that regal throne... it will be a disgrace to my upbringing l cannot break my promise ls that yourfinal decision? On the 10th day of Dussehra the same auspicious hour... Bhallaldev will ascend the throne of Mahishmati. Underthe supervision of commander Baahubali... the grand coronation ceremony will be performed. Queen Mother, kindly reconsider. This is my command. My order is my ordinance. To the east of Mahishmati is the Udayagiri range. Malava islands to its west. Rivers of Kunthala kingdom in the north. Vast extensive Katkari forest and Kalakeya forest in the south. Flanked by nature in all her glory as landscape boundaries. To rule the unequalled Mahishmati kingdom. This is the coronation of Bhallaldev as the ruling monarch. "May Mahishmathi always be indestructible through passage of time indisputable." "May all its endeavors be victorious until the sun, moon, stars shine glorious." Cavalry of Mahishmati. Attention. Salute the king "lmpenetrable, fortified in every form Formidable even to enemies fearsome." "May warfare tactics core be the military forms 4." To receive His Majesty the elephantry pays tribute.

'King Bhallaldev' 'Long live... long live!' 'Emperor Bhallaldev' 'Long live! Long live!!' King of Mahishmati. Long live! 'Our kingdom of Mahishmathi is invincible through passage of time undeniable' 'May the sun, moon, stars effulgent Shower victory forevertriumphant' l, Amarendra Baahubali [CLAMORING VOICES OF DISSENT] l, Amarendra Baahubali... will protect the people of Mahishmati Their health, wealth, mortality and dignity. As supreme commander of King Bhallaldev's armed forces. Without any fear or favor to uphold justice forever l will not even hesitate to sacrifice my life. With Queen Mother Sivagami Devi as witness, l take this oath of allegiance. We will never accept Bhallaldev as the ruler of Mahishmati. Baahubali, long live! Baahubali, long live! Praise be to Baahubali. Mahishmati. From my earliest memories l have always longed for you. Even in my dreams and sleep l placed you on my head. After all these years. After all this struggle. Though in the palm of my hand why am l unable to clasp you? When l have given you pride of place... why did you prefer that lowlife Baahubali to me? Bhalla. Now you are the king. Order Baahubali to be killed. No one can oppose you. Close his chapter l have the authority only to command. The power to execute... is still with Queen Mother l must change that. Change Sivagami? The sun cannot rise in the west, Bhalla. The sun will never rise in the west. But l shall bury it in the east. Sivagami, you nursed a snake and nurtured it on your lap lt is now baring its fangs and spewing venom ln another few days it will bite you. You never understand what l say. l am the cause for your mother and you drifting apart l feel distressed by that burden. My mother's anger will last only till we give her a grandson "lndian 'Baby shower' for Sita the Goddess." "Lord Rama enveloped in effusive happiness." "Goddess Sita wished warmly By her friends and family." "Lord Rama is happy, blissfully." Place these offerings here. The rest overthere. "Waiting eagerly is her consort Rama." "Festoons of mango leaves auspicious Gifts of pearls and other gems precious." "Golden finery-." Worried your mother has not come as yet? She will definitely attend l know for sure. Kattappa? Your Highness. What gift did you bring for me? l am a slave who is not even privileged to wish you whole heartedly. What gift can l offer? lf l ask you for something you can, will you give it? My pleasure. After the umbilical cord is cut for the newborn according to our custom... he will be handed over to his grandfather. To be blessed to see 1000 full moons. Both our fathers are no more. Will you do us the honor, Kattappa? For a slave who has no right to even stand near you... you have elevated me to a father's position l will hold your baby not only in my hand. But carry him on my head. 'Hail Queen Mother Sivagami Devi' Mother...? You are bearing Mahishmati's heir. Take adequate precautions. You lost the privilege to address her as 'amma' long ago. Her graceful presence here is only as Queen Mother. Am l late? Welcome. To the newborn cub to crawl and play. Tiger skin! Did you know your cousin hunted and killed this tiger by himself? Really...? lf a hand wields Baahubali's sword... '...if Baahubali's words are deep seated in any heart' Why me, even a new born baby will kill a tiger! 'Hail our King Bhallaldev' Devasena...! l will give you a special gift which no one else can offer. What gift, Your Majesty? A pregnant woman about to deliver does not desire riches or possessions. She wants only her husband's embrace. Baahu ln performing your official duties, you are forgetting Devasena. Therefore l am relieving you of your duty and transferring it to Sethupathy. Your ordinance, Your Majesty. Baahu...? When such a drama is being enacted in front of you... are you watching the scene like a statue, Queen Mother? Devasena...? You have not understood our customs as yet. The power to decide who is conferred which designation... lies on the king entirely. Just an excuse. Queen Mother...? Compared to a villain's violence a good man's silence shatters a kingdom. 'Are you unaware of that?' How can this title from a brave warrior... be thrown to a dog? - How can you be quiet? - Devasena...! All our guests came laden with gifts. You have not given me any gift Will you give me what l ask? You must occupy Mahishmati's throne. That is my wish. Notjust mine. People of our kingdom wish the same too. You always claim a Kshatriya's duty is to fulfill people's wishes. Then do so. Mother...? Time for the king to enter now. Whoever it may be. Enter through the west gate. Your Highness! You can enter lt is alright You go ahead. 'Move fast' 'So many are waiting behind you' Next will be you. Catch her. Handcop her. 'For the crime of chopping the fingers of the commander Sethupathy' 'lnterrogation of Devasena, wife of Baahubali' 'ln the presence of Queen Mother Sivagami Devi...' '...and Council of Ministers as witness' 'Underthe jurisprudence of king Bhallaldev will commence now' Start the inquiry ls there anything you wish to speak, Devasena? Without a fairtrial you have already shackled me. You have charged me guilty of the crime - ls this what you call 'justice'? - This is the law of Mahishmati. You are guilty until proven otherwise. Even barbarians will not frame a law like this. Throw your Code of Law into the fire. Toss your covenants into the sea lrony is this kingdom is named Mahishmati, meaning 'Ultimate Utopia' Devasena...! About our great, renowned empire if you utter 1 more blasphemous word- Fame is never measured by gigantic forts and golden statues. Only through compassion born and bred in hearts l see no such big hearts. Nor open minds. Shameful! Shameful! You heard her, Your Majesty? lf she can deride us right in front of you... in your absence imagine how low she would have stooped. Baahubali...! Baahubali has come. "Fierce God of storms, ushers peace." "Showered by the Lord of the 7 seas." "Lord Rudra to appease." "Lord Shiva for injustice to cease." What happened? Tell me, Sethupathy. The temple was thronging with devotees. Devasena also arrived. Your Majesty was about to- Since Your Majesty was about to arrive, l told her- l told herto enter through the west gate. Baahu, what is this? Why are you intimidating the victim? The poison in a villainous heart will not spring if asked politely, Your Majesty. You are crossing your limit, Baahubali. When this royal court chained a woman in her final trimester... this court already crossed its limit, mother. Be it a pregnant woman, tottering old hag, you or me... rules of interrogation are the same. Do you know what happened? What happened, Devasena? He asked the women to form a separate line inside the temple. Then he made a pass at them. No, Your Majesty. - He tried to grope me too. - She is lying - l chopped his fingers. - What you did was wrong lf he laid a hand on any woman, you should not chop his fingers. His head! "Our Mahishmathi kingdom is indestructible through passage of time indisputable." "With the sun, moon, stars glorious." "Aligned triumphant, always victorious." Baahubali...! What audacity! How dare you insult my court? Since Sethupathy was guilty, he was perturbed and panic-stricken. Because Devasena spoke the truth she stood absolutely fearless. His guilt has been proved. His head was cleaved! Baahubali...? As you suggested Sethupathy might even be guilty. Who should interrogate and pass the verdict? You or the king? Or are you thinking you are the king? During the baby shower, your wife wanted you to be crowned king. Are you planning to become the king to make her wish come true? Mother? Your wife found fault with Mahishmati's reign. She maligned our Code of Law which is 100 years old. You proved her scornful words with your sword. Both your deeds tantamount to royal treachery. - Minister. - Queen Mother. What is the punishment to be meted out to them? lf any member of the royal family... violates Mahishmati's laws they should be expelled from the palace. So be it. Both of you leave the palace this instant, right now. On one hand is the law you trust. On the other hand is 'Dharma' you taught. Between the two this sword you gave me... made me choose the path of righteousness. Whether l am banished from this palace... to serve and sacrifice my life for Mahishmati l will always be waiting for your call. "O' resplendent sun, racing ahead Unmatched, unsurpassed" l shall take leave, mother. "Protector of our hearts true Dharma will never desert you." "O' glorious sun, dashing ahead Unequalled, unparalleled." "Dharma will never waver Protector of the poor." "Tears as rivulets of pain Will they flow again?" "Will the poor and oppressed step on this land of unrest?" "To remove the swirling darkness in our mind's alcoves of bleakness" "lll-fated beings are we Only you can dispel our misery." "Our humble salutations With awe and adulations." "Striking out strife you gave us back our life." Stop crying. God is leaving the temple and stepping out to live with us. Let us celebrate this Revel in this festival. "Brave warrior; our beloved." "Gallant spearhead." "Lion hearted and fearless." "Courageous and dauntless." "Destroyer of evil." "Favorite of all; dare devil." "Common people are in favor of only you as their ruler." "Your name inscribed on stone as edict voluntarily will turn into gold implicit." "Even if a drop of your sweat falls fields will be filled with wheat stalks." As long as he is alive he will always be regarded as king. "This world will be clothed serene Like paradise on earth lush and green." "Your word is gospel truth for us." "Your glance is an ordinance." How are you able to sleep? He is rebelling and renouncing kingship. He claims he can solve any problem all by himself l am scared something untoward is about to happen, Sivagami. "Our life and heaven true You are our karma too." "You are the heartbeat of the people anew." "Our humble salutations With awe and adulations." "Striking out strife you gave us back our life." "Our revered salutations ln joy and jubilations." "With your love so merciful You made our life meaningful." Bhalla, what are you doing at this hour of night here? Why is he here? Forgive us, Your Majesty. He escaped this time. Tomorrow if you do not place his head in my hand- Whose head? l will chop your head and place it in your hand... go. Bhalla, whose head? Who else? Baahubali of course! You usurped his throne, exiled him Stooping down further you want to kill him. You are my- Not just him, but his wife too l will kill her unborn baby too lf you oppose me, l will disregard the fact you are my father! l overheard l know about my son very well lf he makes up his mind... he has to achieve it. - We must inform Baahubali at once. - Will he believe us? Baahubali is very innocent. He will never believe this evil side of his older brother l can see only one way out. Please tell me. That is also only in your hands ln my hands? Bhallaldev should be killed by you! Do not say 'no', Kumara. For Baahubali's sake. For Devasena. For the baby in her womb. Kill my son Bhallaldev. Alright. 'Kumara Varma' 'Time offers every spineless man a minute to become a brave warrior' 'That minute is ticking now' Are you totally in the dark of what is happening, Kumara Varma? Sacrificial offering is being performed! To get Baahubali's death warrant signed and sealed by Sivagami's own hands. A great 'yagna' ln that ritual, you are a small piece of wood. Look, Sivagami. Baahubali gave his dagger to Kumara Varma his wife's cousin and right hand. He showed him the secret passage known only to the Royal family. He has sent him to kill the king at midnight. Kumara Varma and his men... killed all our bodyguards. 'He has slit Bhallaldev's face' After all this has happened... we should not delay even for a minute. Baahubali should be killed. Why are you still introspecting, Sivagami? Discharge your duty as the Queen Mother. 'Do not fall prey to your maternal instincts' 'Choose kingdom or unconditional love' 'The snake you breast fed' 'Or the son born of your own blood' 'Decide now, Sivagami' Bhallaldev is not only your son. He is also the ruler of our kingdom. Whoever tries to kill the king... he has to be sentenced to death. lf Baahubali is sentenced to death... our people will revolt. Our court will split into factions. Our kingdom will go up in a blaze of protest. This does not augur well for our kingdom lf that is the case... do you intend forgiving him even after all this treason? Are you blinded by your love of raising him? Have you gone mad? Baahubali's death is certain. But his blood stains should not smearthe hands of Bhallaldev. History should not defame the king for murdering his brother lf that is so... what is your plan? Kattappa. Your ancestors have pledged their allegiance to the royal throne. They have promised to obey every command by the king. Do you adhere to that oath? No doubt indeed. Your wish is my command. Kill Baahubali. What are you saying? 'Why, Your Majesty?' 'lt does not concern you' Queen Mother? ls this happening with your consent? l beg of you. Ask the king to take back his command. 'Even integrity can take a backseat' Baahubali has no mean bone in his body. He grew up drinking your milk. The Dharma you taught him, runs in his blood. Baahubali has to die. No, Queen Mother l cannot do it. As punishment for my refusal... please sever my head. Will you kill him? Or shall l finish this task? No, Queen Mother. Your hands should not be stained by that sin l will carry out the royal command l will kill him. Can we trust this dog, Bhalla? Our king will have a son brave as a tiger. Everything will be fine. Accusing Kattappa of royal treason... they are dragging him to behead him. What do you mean? Yes, my lord l saw them. Hey! What do you mean? Devasena, uncle Kattappa is in danger l have to leave now, Devasena. He has promised to hold our baby in his hands. Please escort him back here safe and sound. Look after yourself. Baahubali! What happened? Massacre them. Leave me here and go, Baahu. Life of this slave is not more precious than yours. Baahu. Baahu, listen to me. For my sake. Leave me here and go. Allow me to die. Pay heed to my words, Baahu. Even l want to desert you, my dear old man. You have promised to hold our baby in your hands first l have also promised my wife l will bring you back safe and sound. Therefore if you are quiet for a while... l will do my duty. 'How do l convince you?' 'My dear Baahu' l bow at yourfeet and beg of you. Leave me here to die. LEAVE ME HERE, BAAHU Are you scared something will happen to me? As long as you are by my side no man has been born as yet to kill me. "Our dear prince forever." "Our cherished treasure." Uncle. Uncle...! Royal command. 'To kill you' 'From the King' Baahu. Baahu, forgive me. Forgive- Please for... forgive me, Baahu. Forgive me, l beg you. Take care of my mother. Long live Mahishmati! l suspected you unnecessarily. You are my slave, my dog indeed. Baahubali. Amarendra Baahubali 'l, Amarendra Baahubali' '...will protect the people of Mahishmati Their health, wealth, mortality, dignity' 'As your savior' 'With Queen Mother Sivagami Devi as witness' 'l take this oath of allegiance' Queen Mother. Foolish mother l deceived her, making her think you planned to kill me l made her sign and seal your death warrant. 'Who are you to take your oath swearing on her?!' [AGITATED VOICES IN DISSENT] Queen Mother, step out to address our grievances. What has happened to our Baahubali? Blood of Baahubali. Can we wash away this sin from our hands in this birth? Kattappa! You blundered, Sivagami! A grave mistake indeed. You did not understand Baahubali's true nature. You thought he was opposing you. 'Foolish mother!' 'l deceived her, making her think you planned to kill me' 'l made her sign and seal your death warrant' When he breathed his last... he did not think of his wife or unborn child. Do you know the last words he uttered? 'Take care of my mother' "Close your eyes, my son." "To rule the world you were born." "Sleep deep and peacefully." "Baahubali." "Uncle Kattappa will be." "With you Wherever you go." "Your elder brother gaily will play with you daily." "You can call me 'mother' though born to another" "l will protect you eternally." "Jewel in my crown, Baahubali." You gave me the honor to hold your baby 1st in my hands. With the same hands l killed your husband, my dear. Strangle this tiny throat, Sivagami. This baby's cry will magnify into the revolting voices of our people. Before there is anarchy and uproar... kill this baby. Only if we stifle the cry of this newborn... all enemies of Mahishmati will be annihilated. Crush him, Sivagami. Realizing the virtues of Baahubali... you have risen above the infinite sky. Killing the son whom l nursed... l have fallen at your feet in disgrace. Other than joining him in his abode to wash his feet with my tears of remorse... how else can l repent? What else can l do? Queen Mother, step out to address our grievances. We are hearing various sad rumors. Mother. Not knowing for sure if Baahubali is dead or not... herd mentality, the people are clamoring for an official declaration. They will believe only if you announce. Go and announce l will decide his fate. Amarendra Baahubali is no more. Now your new king. Mahendra Baahubali! "Lord Shiva, decider of destiny." "Omnipresent in every journey." Mahendra Baahubali Long live! Kattappa, call for an urgent meeting of the Council of ministers. The guilty should be hanged until death in public. So be it, mother. Baahubali was your breath. You executed his death believing he had sinned. How will l think you will forgive me, mother? Would l not have taken ample precautions? Guards. Kill Sivagami and the baby in her hands. Come with me, Queen Mother. Devasena. Get up Listen to me. Saving my son... is equal to giving my husband back to me. Mahendra, you must come back here l will be waiting for you. This kingdom will be waiting for you. Will you come back to me? Your Majesty, she has escaped. 'The entire administration of Mahishmati...' '...slipped into the hands of the demon Bhallaldev' 'Due to his murderous rage over Devasena he reduced Kunthala kingdom to cinders' To love or hate in this world... only l remain, Devasena. 'Everyone thought you were dead' 'Your grandmother sacrificed her life to save you' Your mother. Your kingdom. Waited for 25 long years. Only for you, Mahendra. Send word to our kingdom, grandfather. Ask the young, old, brave, coward, everyone to assemble before me. Tell them to bring any weapon they can find Sword, sabre, stick, spear, scythe, sickle. To eradicate the disease defiling this kingdom. Queen Mother Sivagami's grandson and Amarendra Baahubali's heir. Tell them Mahendra Baahubali is back again. They have 30000 warriors, Your Majesty. We do not even have proper weapons to wage a war. Our hands are our weapons. This life is our battlefield. Each one of us is a powerful army. Praise be to Mahishmati! Long live our kingdom! Golden statue praiseworthy Throne of Mahishmati. Crown over my head And title as king. All along l assumed this only gave me happiness. But l was wrong. This iron chain is the source of all my joy. And the pleasure of giving Devasena hell on earth- This iron chain. When l see she is not enslaved any longer... the veins in my skull are erupting to explode l want Devasena. Your Majesty, Kattappa has garnered support from those third-rate people to fight us. Kattappa? Why should this slave dog Kattappa revolt now? "Hail the one who wears skulls as necklace." Bhalla...? What happened? "Rudra, omnipotent, omnipresent always." Bhadra, every single head there which witnessed your death will roll. My beloved son, l will pile all those heads and place yours on top l will cremate you on the funeral pyre. With the anguished cries of 10,000 families... echoing as an auspicious tune l promise to perform your funeral service. DEATH TO THE ENEMY! CHARGE! ATTACK! "Fierce God of storms, ushers peace Showered by the Lord of the 7 seas." "As Rudra He dances in fury Lord Shiva, our sentinel and sanctuary" 'Pratigaat!' Your son was in your womb. After all for 9 months. Being my captive for 25 years... ,ou think l will let you go, depriving me of my mental happiness? Move. "Dharani, earth for sustenance." "Janani, divine mother of benevolence." "Avani, basis of existence." Blow the bugle. Release your arrows. Wait, Mahendra l am not stone hearted to watch him drag my mother l do not care if l die l must save her. Was your mother's penance all these decades to see you die? To watch him die! Are you Amerandra Baahubali's son whose radiant thoughts lit the dark womb? Think like your father. Think like Baahubali. 'Push... help us Goddess Shakthi' 'Pull harder... with the grace of our Goddess Shakthi' 'Give it your best with all your strength' Attack. Find the sentry who operates the draw bridge. What are you doing, Kattappa? Your forefathers for generations were servile to the king. And earned unbounding good will. You have tarnished their good reputation. Are you trying to go back on your word? Do not succumb to this, Kattappa. Set right your wrong-doing ln the same way you killed Baahubali... close his son's chaptertoo. Go, Kattappa. Kill him 25 years ago... Queen Mother proclaimed Mahendra Baahubali as our king. Assuming he was no more... all these years l have served a lie discharging my duties duly. Our king has returned. Kattappa never breaks his promise. Half the army of Bhallaldev is inside the fort, Mahendra. We must find a way for our troops to enter l want a hammer, grandfather Shiva...! Light the fire, Avantika. Hand me the staff, grandfather. "Hail the one who wears skulls as necklace." Take that step, mother. "To the one who gives Shakthi equal space." Before you circumambulate Lord Shiva thrice... to burn him alive and reduce him to ashes, l will make him lie on this pyre. Go ahead, Devasena. Before you come back here, l will place your son's head in your hands. Trial by fire. Whoever completes it will never face defeat, my lord. Create hurdles. Stop Devasena from completing her 3 rounds. 'Before she circumambulates Lord Shiva...' set the bridge on fire. Cover... protect her. How dare you break my statue's head! As soon as l set eyes on you when all along l thought you were dead... mere words cannot express how joyous l felt l orchestrated yourfather's murder. My own hands did not slay him has given me sleepless nights. You are the splitting image of him. You have come to grant my unfulfilled dream. Now you have given me the chance to pluck your heart out and fling it into hell. How can l express my gratitude? Mahendra Baahubali.
