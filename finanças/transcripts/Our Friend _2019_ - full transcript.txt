Oh! Whoa. All right. We're gonna give that one to Evie, but only 'cause she's in last place. Was there a way that you want to do this? I think we just be honest. Um, Karen gave me a list of words to avoid so we don't leave the door open for the girls. Do you remember what they are? I wrote them down. Um, on the paper on the dresser. Um... "Mommy's going to sleep. Mommy's going on vacation. Mommy's going away for a while." Do you want to do the talking or do you want me to? I think... I think you... you should do the talking. And I'm just... I'll hold them real close to me. All right. All right. All right. I'm gonna bring them in. Oh, fuck. Goddamn it. Oh, goddamn this thing. Matt. I don't know that I can do it. I don't know if I can do it. You can do it, baby. I'm scared too. These are my babies. Okay. All right. I'll go get them. Okay. Come on, you guys. Yay! Hi, girls. - Hi. - Hi. Hi, baby. How's your arm, Momo? Better. It doesn't even hurt anymore. You're so tough. This is gonna be great. You're a star. - You're gonna sing and dance? - Yes. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot hot, hot. Goddamn it. Oh! I have... You need to fix it! Oh, God! MacGyver it! MacGyver it! Are you kidding? It's worse. I'm so excited to see you tonight. They're gonna say, "There she is. The greatest living musical theater actress of all time." I'm not that good. - Will you come to the cast party? - Thank you. If I have to. Will you be nice to Dane? The asshole who asked you out on a date? Okay, well, he's not an asshole, first of all. Yeah. And he didn't know that I was married, so, yeah. He asked me out on a date. Okay. I'll deal with it. You gonna hang out with him? Be nice? I have to do that? You need to try to make friends here. I have friends here. Where? I have so many friends at work. You hate those people. Yeah. But you talk shit about them every night. Yeah. My best friends. - Oh! No! - It's so hot! I love you. I love you. Please don't be late tonight, Matthew. Late for what? Glenn. Morning. Teague. I've been tossing some feature ideas around. You remember that murder on 7th and Ward last week? With the mother and child got caught in the gang cross fire and only the mother survived. Yeah. I already gave that to Lyle. He's gonna approach it like it's a miracle the mother lived, blah, blah, blah. Now she's gotta learn how to live in a world where there's no son around. That kind of stuff. Okay. I can see the irony that he's going for there, but I was gonna take a different tack. Which is to try to stick to the facts and report some of the pertinent information to the community. For example, paramedics took 20 minutes to get there. What part of I already gave it to Lyle didn't you get? Just the part about Lyle being a dipshit and a terrible writer. It's Friday, Teague. It's Friday. I've been tired of you since Wednesday. You know? Matt Teague. - Matthew. - Yeah. This is, uh, Rick Bragg calling from The New York Times. Yes. Yes, sir. Um, did you write this feature "Long Way Home"? Yes, I did. It's a masterful piece of writing. Um, well, thank you, sir. That means a lot coming from you. Well earned. Well earned. Listen, how fast can you make it up to The Times office here in Atlanta? Because I need you down here ASAP to come and lick my asshole. Well, let me see how quickly I can get down there. Uh, it's awfully appetizing. Maybe you can clean it out since I know Bradshaw's been in there every week. Oh, shit! Oh, man. You should've seen your fucking face, Teague. "Oh. Oh, that means a lot to me, sir. Thank you, sir. That means a lot." That's funny. Did it take all three of y'all to come up with that? Yes, all three. - Hi, Froot Loop. - Hey. Hi. Got you a Coke. Oh, thanks. Um, well, you know, in exchange I made you a mix. Oh, Dang-o-Lang. Yeah. Is it as depressing as the last one? I was going through a My Bloody Valentine phase. You're never gonna let me live it down. No, I won't. I'm almost done with your Zeppelin compilation. Oh, my God, please, just save it. I don't understand. Led Zeppelin is the greatest rock band of all time. They are my number one "I don't get it" band. Favorite band. "I don't get it." Favorite band. "I don't get it" band. Um, I have some big news. I'm gonna ask Charlotte out tonight. Yeah. Wow. Finally! I know. I was waiting for the right time. Good lord. But then I saw Travis is playing the Saenger Theatre next week so I got two tickets. Did you talk to her at the party last night? Dane, did you go to the party last night? I went to the party like you told me. I didn't see her there and I didn't know anybody, so I left. I just got a little... Well, I think that you two would be perfect together. Yeah? Okay. Good, me too. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Cool. You don't think she's too pretty for me... I really don't like it when you do that. Do what? Cut yourself down like that and doubt yourself. Don't do that, Dane. Hi, guys. Looks so nice. This is gonna be a good-ass show. Hey, Nicole. Hi, Charlotte. Do you have a minute? Yeah, of course. What's up? Um, so, you're like really good friends with Dane from stage crew, right? Yeah. Has he ever mentioned anything to you about me? Only a couple things here and there every day for the last three months. Oh, no. That's what I was worried about. I'm not into him. And he is such a nice guy. Yeah. I know he likes me because he comes and he tells me jokes. Mm-hmm. And, um, I kinda started up this new thing with Aaron anyway. That Aaron? Stage manager Aaron? I know, right? He's totally not my normal type. But he is really goal driven. - Great. - Anyways, so I was just wondering if maybe you had any advice on how I could let Dane down easy. Well, let me just think about it and then I'll come back to you. Thanks, Nicole. Yeah. No problem. Break a leg. Thank you. You too. Thanks. ♪ Nobody's on nobody's side ♪ ♪ Better learn to go it alone Recognize you're out On your own ♪ ♪ Nobody's on nobody's side ♪ It's not that she's not into me. It's that... does it have to be so aggressive? His hands are superglued to her ass. Maybe don't look at it anymore. Well, I... It just feels like it's at me. I know. You want another drink? That might be good. I'm gonna get another round. Okay. Okay. So, listen, um, I know that Nicole probably mentioned that I asked her out. And I just wanted you to know I had no idea you guys were married. It's all right. It's fine. Okay. It's fine. So you write for The Times-Pic? Yeah. That's funny. You re... you re... Some... you know, I always think no one's even paying attention. - And then you run into somebody who's read stuff... - No, I haven't read anything. But Nicole mentioned that you write for the paper and so I... I remembered that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm just writing features right now, but it's not exactly what I wanna be doing. What do you want to be doing? I mean, if I'm gonna be writing for a newspaper, I wanna write stuff that is... seems relevant and important and that might actually inform someone and then they do something, and then it changes the world. You know, like write about some war here or some people who are getting screwed here or there's corruption there or just, like, not the dog show in Shreveport. Right. I think that's beautiful. Thanks, man. What about you? I've thought about doing standup comedy. - Well, that's good. - Yeah. You tell jokes? Or, I guess, write jokes? I haven't done any of those things yet, but I've started to think... I've started to think about like things I notice are funny. And then I'll... I would then go from there. Like I'd write out a game plan first. Do you know what I mean? Which would be jokes, right? I think you get to jokes. But you need to start... Like a bigger message. No, I just mean like get a pen, get a pad. That's funny, man. You are funny. That's great. Gotta get out of my parents' basement first. I hear that. Yup. Well... Hey, man, if you ever hear of other guys who are like really asking her out over and over... I'll take them out back, I'll string 'em up by their nutsacks. - Thanks, Dane. - Nah, I'll make sure that they know that she's, uh... - you know, she's hitched. - Married. Married. Hitched. Oh, here. I was just... Um, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go outside and take this. No, no, no, go for it. Sorry. It's just a... - Matthew Teague? - Yeah? This is Rick Bragg with The New York Times. - Yeah? - I just finished reading your piece on the Lake Charles tornado. And I think you're worth saving. Next time you're in Atlanta, stop by my office. Hey. I just got a phone call. It was, um... And I, um... Yeah? What? I have to go to... Matt? ...Atlanta. Are you okay? Uh... Matt, okay, okay, okay. What's happening? He's a fainter. Careful. Careful. It's when he gets excited or panicked. What happened? I have... Rick Bragg called. The... What? The New York Times guy? Yeah. And he said that I'm worth saving. - I don't know what that means. What does that mean? - I don't know. I don't know. But I think I gotta drive up there and find out. Okay. Right now? I'm all right. I think so. Do you want to come? I... I can't. I have a performance tomorrow. You go. Okay. I love you. I love you. Dane, it was really nice... It was nice to meet you. - Hey. Wait, Matt! - It was a real pleasure, man. - Matt! Oh my God. - Oh, he's down. ♪ We could bind it In the scythe ♪ ♪ We could gather Throw a fit ♪ ♪ Up to par and Katie bar ♪ ♪ The kitchen signs... ♪ Check it out!

I told Charlotte I'd be there by 9:00. She's had Molly and Evie since Tuesday. Oh. I'm starting to feel bad. Yeah. How's Matt holding up? He's not good. Oh. - He fainted in the hospital two days ago. - What? He's been taking care of Nicole on his own for six months. He's tired. Yeah. I'd be tired. Um, I, uh... We did presents like two days ago. I know, but I just got you something... You're really good to me. I'm gonna open this, okay? Yeah. Kat, this is the most expensive one in the whole line. - I know. I just... - I've been wanting this. I know. I wanted it. There's something else in the box. That's to my apartment. This is like a really big step. Yeah, but it's a good step, right? Yeah. I know. Yeah. I figured that we're like over a year now. So I thought... I don't know. Thought it was good that, um, that it was like, maybe... - Charlotte! Girls! - Stay outside, Dane! - Don't come inside, Dane! - Oh! Holy Moly! What is that? What's going on with the smell? It's something that came out of the dog. We're not sure which end. Merry Christmas! Yeah, Merry Christmas to you. Merry Christmas. I'm sorry I'm late. Traffic was bad. I left New Orleans at 6:00, I guess. It's not a problem. Aaron was able to get off work early. - Um, Matt called the vet. They said they'd stay open for you. - Right. Yeah, good idea. He said not to take the girls. They can stay overnight at Gale's. That's the snobby doctor's wife on August Circle? Yeah. That's the one. I'm so sorry to rush out on you. - No, that's all right. It's great to see you. - You too. - How you doing? You holding up all right? - I'm good, you know. Just happy to be able to help in some way, you know? - How about you? - Yeah, I'm good. - Good? - Yeah. My life's really good. Awesome. Well, Merry Christmas. Bye, girls! Merry Christmas! Be good. Merry Christmas, Charlotte! Bye, Dane. Bye. - Can we come down now? - Is the smell gone, Dane? No. No. I will give you the all clear. - I can still smell it. - Ew! Okay. I'm just gonna do it. One, two, three. Why can't I come with you? I don't know how long I'm gonna be in there, Mols. Is it because my dad's too much of a chicken to tell us what's going on? - Maybe. - She's my dog so I should be there for her. Well, you're Matt's daughter and so it's just not really up to me. I'm sorry. Have you met Santa's elves before? Evie, that's a great question. Thank you. - Yeah, I met Santa's elves once. - When? Once. I met them at at a tiki bar in New Orleans. Do you think elves really have pointy ears or do you think that's just in movies? These elves had pointy ears and cigarette breath. - Hi, girls. - Hi, Mrs. Abbott. Go on upstairs. Hey. Hey, man. Um, I just... I'm just gonna say it. The vet thinks we should put Gracie down tonight. She has cancer. Okay. So, would you like to come back and hold her? Uh, you mean while you, uh... Yeah, you know, most owners like to be in the room with them. Okay. I mean, it's not my dog. Right. But you're the good close friend of the family. She knows you. It'd be better than just being with us strangers. Okay? Well, we're ready when you are. Okay. That tickles. - I know, but it's in relation. - Hi, girls! Hi, Molly. Hi, sweetie. Greet your Mom. Hi, Froot Loop. Hey. How you feeling? Tired. How are you? How's Kat? She's good. - Thanks for being here. - I wouldn't miss it. Get over here. What are you even thinking? Too far away from me. Hi, my girls. Look, you're like a two-headed monster. I haven't told Molly about Gracie. Okay. Just a head's up. She's pretty pissed off. Yup. I'm gonna talk to her. I just want to separate Nicole's cancer from the dog's cancer. And I haven't really figured out how yet. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Would it help if I stayed for a while? You don't need to do this alone if you don't want to. I could, uh... I have some vacation days. I could come help out. Help you get to the other side of this. Okay, great. We'd love to have you. All right. Done. There's a B&B near our house. Okay. Look at that. Hi. Surprise! Look at this room. Brought you flowers. They smell so good. Hi, honey. The other day, remember? And that's... and I, uh... I still got cotton candy. Hiya. Hi. Hey, Mols, um, I'm using mayonnaise and mustard. Is that kind of how your dad does it? I guess. He hasn't made sandwiches in a long time. I usually end up making them myself. I make breakfast and dinner and make sure Evie showers... Hey, you know what? You know what? Maybe old Dane can take some of that weight off for ya. How's that sound? This is not just a Mom and Dad sandwich. This is... It's like a Grandma sandwich. Speaking of which, I was hoping that from now on you would call me Grandma Dane. Sure. Molly! Excuse me. Sure, what? Sure I'll call you Grandma Dane. Thank you.

By the way, I can see that you're looking at you and not me. - Don't look at the little square, look at the big square. - You can't see that. I can. I'm embarrassed like I'm just like... It's like a check-in. So how long do you think you'll be up there? I'm hoping like just a couple weeks or something, max. But I mean... I just wanna make sure Matt gets back on his feet. All right, well, I just wanna make sure you're taking care of yourself. I know how you can get, so I'll let you go, but waiting for you and, um, I love you a lot. I love you too. Okay. Good night. Bye. I don't know how. It might mean that I just have to stay a little bit longer. I can't... Can I call you back when I can hear you? It's hard to explain a lot of things.

And then the kids are all making this really amazing, big, colorful mural for their teachers to thank them. It's really sweet. The Atlantic offered me a job and I have to go to Libya. Oh. Um, when? I leave on the 14th. You leave on the 14th. So you accepted it already? Well, we need the money, don't we? I didn't think I had a choice. - God. - I wanna see Dad. Oh, um, say hi. Hi, girls. Let me talk to Mom for a minute, all right? - Matt... It's okay. - Let me talk to Mom. Hi. Why are you so upset about this? I don't understand. We talked all about it. We talked about this a hundred times. You wanted to move to Fairhope to be near your family. Yeah, but I never, ever wanted to be a single mother. - That's not how I imagined my life. - You're not a single mother. - And you haven't even told me when... - I can't give you a timeline. I can't give you a timeline of every little thing that's gonna happen. I don't know. Listen, it's been a really long day. I'm sorry. Can we just talk about it tomorrow? All right. Bye. They took all of our panties. That must have been a rough four miles, huh? You're ridiculous. Oh, man, she was amazing. Kelly went to Iraq the next day. Mm. Then she died one week later. Sometimes I don't know why we do this job. Uh, fame and fortune. Or... tea and biscuits. Oh, uh, what floor are you? Six. I'm four. I'm six. I'm four. It's been a long trip, Matt. Yeah, I know. Good night, Elizabeth. Good night. Oh my word. I mean, is the whole town... Well, you need a good welcoming. Hello, ladies! Hi. I want y'all to meet one of my oldest friends Charlotte. She's amazing. She just moved her from Baton Rouge with her husband. And as you can see, she's a little bit pregnant. Just a little. So, let's show her a really good time and welcome her. I can have one glass of wine. Alison, oh, my God! Gale. Yes? Hi. Yes. So nice to meet you. I've heard so much about you. You too, for years. Yes. ...wet the bed, but like an unbelievable amount of urine. - That's how she does. - Okay. She's like the mayor of Fairhope. Oh my God. You know, and she was like, "Oh, no, you don't need to dress up." ...the whole mattress. I was like, "We have to buy a whole new house." Hey, Momo, will you please go watch your sister? But give me a kiss first. Thank you, my girl. Do you know that eight women think they're your best friends? Well, you really are my best friend. Mm-hmm. I better be. It's true. You are. I have stories. Oh, dang. Yeah. Are you gonna blackmail me? If I have to. You know, you got a whole new crew. - Oh, my God. - I gotta let them know who's boss. You're frightening. So I'm here in Fairhope, Alabama, visiting my friends and their kids. I've been reading to the kids. It's very interesting. They see these stories through like different eyes than we do. The other day I read, uh, their daughter Molly One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish. You remember that one? And when I finished, she said, "That's scary, Dane." I said, "What's scary about it? Is it the one fish? The two fish? The red fish? The blue fish? She said, "No. Your lack of ambition." Thank you. It's pretty scary to come up here. I have a friend who's been wanting to try standup, but, uh, he's never done it. He's a little chicken. So, being in a rural area like Fairhope, it's tough because there's not good cell phone reception. - Put your pocket back in. - Thank you. There's not good cell phone reception, unlike New Orleans. And I got a lady back in New Orleans. And we like to keep the, uh, magic alive so we like to have a little phone sex, if you know what I mean. And the bad service makes it a little hard because things break up in the middle of some heated moments. My girlfriend's not very good at filling in the blanks. I mean, we're grown adults. Why would I want you to, uh, play with my clock? Thank you. Thank you so much, Fairhope, Alabama! That's so rude. That's so rude. But no, I spend all day with her sometimes. Like write jokes and whatever. It's pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah, and meet people. Nice. When does Matt get back? Eleven. He's home for four days. And then he goes to Libya. Whoa, when did that happen? When did it happen or when did he tell me? I feel like I... married a war correspondent, not a journalist. I mean, have you told him that? Matt hears what he wants to hear. How's Colleen? All right. Um, Colleen broke up with me last week. Dane! I know. She said that she, um, didn't feel like our relationship was evolving. Whatever. She's not stupid. She's great. She's nice. Eh. I'm moving on. Um, there's this girl named Kat that I think I'm gonna ask out. She's a baker, which is cool. - Okay. - Yeah. Don't be afraid to give yourself to somebody, Dane. Promise me. It's not fair that I'm the only woman who knows how special you are. Hey, look who's here. Hey, girls. - Daddy! - Did you bring me a toy? - Wow. Did you bring me a toy? - No. Oh, well, then forget it. I got it. Thanks. How you doing? Aaah! Yeah? Yeah. Good. Is she still mad at me? Oh, yeah. Oh, good. Hi, babe. Oh, man, that is a sophisticated looking shirt. So do we go all in now or do we save up for the end of the line? I mean, maybe leave some for some children, but... Is there a slice limit? Since you're monitoring my, you know, plate. Hey, what are you doing? Get out of there. Mols, get out of there. Hey, stay with your sister. Molly! Watch your sister. I bet you got some wild stories, huh? Hey, one night we'll leave the wives at home, we'll grab some beers - and you can tell us some of them. - Hey, Molly, help your sister! Yeah, well, I tell Nicole everything pretty much. But we can hang out sometime... - Molly, stay with Evie! - Yeah, right, man. I bet you've had some adventures, huh? - Shit. - Are you okay? Is it your foot? Evie... God. What are you doing? I'm sorry. It was an accident. Didn't I tell you to watch your sister? What's the matter with you? What happened? Why don't you listen to me? It's okay. Come on, Evie. Get up. It's not your fault, Mols. Yeah, it is her fault. I asked her five damn times to watch her sister. Matt! Watch your mouth. What? Seriously? You've been here for two hours. You're already acting like this? Acting like what, Nicole? Acting like what? It's all right. Come on. Don't take The Atlantic assignment, Matt. Stick around, just be with the girls. Be with Nicole for a little while. Nicole has you doing her bidding now? She's not having me doing anything. Why does she think I'm working so much? We need the money. I understand. I really do. I just... My advice is that you sit this one out. And you think I should be taking life advice from you? Yeah. Yeah, actually I do. And what qualifies you for that? I'm your best friend, asshole. I'm allowed to point out your shitty qualities. Like what? Like what? Like you're moody. You're selfish. You're distant. Is that enough? You want more? No, that's fine. And as coming from someone as successful as you are, I will take it under advisement. Is that supposed to hurt my feelings or something? Oh, no, not at all. I mean, as far back as I can remember, you've always dreamed of selling discount floor hockey equipment. So when I look at you, I just think that's the guy I want to take advice from. Let me do it how he says. He's got the answers. Don't take the job. Won't take the job. Stay on that track. I'm gonna go see the girls. You think I don't know my life's shit right now? Yeah, well, then don't tell me what the fuck to do. All right. Molly and Evangeline. What? That's their names in case you forgot. Oh, fuck you. Yeah, fuck you too, Matt. How did you catch it like that? Oh! Oh! Touchdown! Go. Go get the stuff. Have you noticed that the only thing Nicole wants to eat is mayonnaise? I have, yeah. She ate a whole bowl of it in front of me yesterday. I thought about submitting her to an ultimate eating contest. How's it going with having Kat around? Good. We're having a good weekend. Just get the minis. Yeah. Um, how come Nicole's parents don't come down more often and help? Just out of curiosity. Well, they have no idea how sick she really is. Every time someone comes, them or anyone else, she's such a good performer. She puts on her blonde wig and her makeup and she runs around the house and she entertains, and makes everybody food and then they leave. And they say, "Oh, Nicole's doing great." And she collapses for three days. Right. Got it. Hey. Have you told them about the affair? No. No, why? Because once we agreed to try to make it work, we said we weren't gonna tell parents or kids. Of course. - Throw. - Throw. - Throwing. - Throwing a baseball. - Fighting. - Punching! Fight! Food fight! Yes! Yes. Way to go, Mols. Good teamwork, girls. Good teamwork. Hey, everybody. Hi, Richard, how are ya? What did y'all get? Pringles. Look what Kat made. Yeah. I know. I saw. That's great. Hey. Hey. What? Do you want to get some rest before I make some food? No, we're in the middle of charades, Matt. Well, you can play charades from the couch. I don't want to play charades from the fucking couch. Would you rather me just lock myself in my room all day long? Would that be easier for you? Would you like that better? God. Okay! Who is next? - I'm next. - Evie's next. This big and then this big. This and this. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. How are things back home? Good. Yeah. They're really good. Um, Cooper had a birthday party. He made us run a 5K. Wow. And then we did a pub crawl. I'm sorry I wasn't there. Yeah, everyone was asking about you. Oh. That's nice. Yeah. I know. It was cute. Yeah. Have you talked to Steve about work or... Um, you know, I actually think they're gonna take me off the schedule altogether for now, so. Oh. Well, maybe that's a good thing. So when you get back, you'll be able to look for something more permanent. Well, what do you mean more permanent? I was full time at Red Beard's. No, I know. But you're not gonna work at Red Beard's for the rest of your life. Hmm. Would that be a problem? Anyway, we're gonna sit down and we are gonna talk it out next time I'm there. Is there gonna be a next time? Well, I just mean that you've been gone for three months now, Dane. I came... I came home. Yeah, for a weekend just so you could grab more stuff to come back here. I mean, I thought that you were gonna be gone for like a couple weeks. What changed? What changed is I got here and I saw that one person can't do this job. Okay? It's... No, between the girls and Nicole's medicine and the chemo sessions, Matt can't do this on his own. Yeah, but they have other people in their life. Like Nicole's family. Let me grab those for you. Thank you. Mm-hmm. - Nicole's family lives close by. - I don't know what you want me to say. They have other people in their life besides you, Dane. I just feel like I'm supposed to be here right now. Yeah, well, people back home are talking. - What people? - My family. My family. They're asking me what kind of person gives up his entire life. - His job, his girlfriend... - I don't know. I would say a good friend. I would say someone who's running from something. Jesus. Okay. Why is it so hard for you to see my side? The first layer will only develop around three months old. And we call this braiding. This is a French braid. Hey. Hi. Where's Kat? Um, Kat had to get back to New Orleans because they're gonna open the bakery up early in the morning. Oh. Momo, upstairs. Bedtime. Good night. Good night, honey. - Good night, Dane. - Night, Molly. How was dinner? Just fine. It was good. We know you're lying, Froot Loop. - Totally lying. - Spit it out. Um, I think that Kat is looking for more of a commitment than I'm, like, ready to give her. I don't know. I don't know. Well, I really like her, so don't lead her on, okay? I never said that I'm leading her on. Well, I just mean that at your age, if your heart isn't in it, then you just have to tell her. Just like, you know. - It's not that simple. - Well, the right thing never really is. Okay, do you have to be so goddamn self-righteous all the time? I'm not self-righteous. Jesus fucking Christ, Nicole. Oh my God. You need to grow up, Dane. - Dane! Dane! - What's wrong? Molly, take Evie upstairs. Everything's all right. Dane! Okay, okay, okay. - What's happening to Mom? - Molly, fucking go upstairs! It's okay. I'm gonna take her to the hospital. Will you stay? Yup. Yup, yup, I got it. Hey, girls, everything's all right. I'm coming up, okay? Thanks, Matt. I'm really, really, really sorry I yelled at you, Molly. It's fine. No, it's not fine. I didn't want you to see Mom like that. I just lost my temper. Okay? Hello, everyone. Can we talk for a minute, Matt? Mm-hmm. Why are you so hard on your dad? 'Cause he's never been around. And all of a sudden Mom gets sick and he thinks he can just boss everyone around? 'Cause he's your dad. Shut up, Dane. "Shut up, Dane." Oh! Did you just elbow me? 'Cause it didn't hurt. At all. Now it hurts. Molly, you've broken my body. I saw you smile. Nicole's sleeping now. The surgery to fix her bowel went fine. Great. Great. Thank you. When we opened her up, Matt, the cancer's everywhere. It's like someone dipped a paintbrush in it and flicked it all around her abdomen. So... So the chemo's not working? No. It's terminal. So then how long are you... Are you saying that... I don't like to give timelines. Right. I have two kids who I need to tell something to. If I had to say, six months. It's going to get very hard, Matt. With the combination of the disease and the drugs, you're gonna see things from Nicole you've never seen before. Confusion, anger, lashing out. Before this is over, when it gets hard, and it's going to get hard, I want you to call this woman. Faith Pruett. She's an angel. I'm sorry, Matt. Hey. There she is. Hi, babies. Were you crying? Yeah, but I was crying 'cause I'm so happy that we got through this and I get to come home with you guys. Come here. Come closer, baby. We didn't know where you were. What do you mean? The nurse, um, gave us the wrong room number. Oh. Did that scare you? Yes. Yeah? I'm sorry, baby. If that ever happens again... ...you just close your eyes... go ahead, close your eyes. You too, my sweet. Close your eyes. If that ever happens again, just close your eyes and you'll see me right there. I don't see you. Look a little closer, baby. You see me? I'll always be right there. Okay? Yeah. We're not gonna tell the girls I'm dying yet. Okay? Not until my quality of life declines to the point where there's just, like, no more hiding it. And, um... And I wanna make a list. Like a... like a bucket list, I guess. Um... I want to finish reading the girls the Lord of the Rings books. And I'd like to reread all my favorite books too. And... And, um, I'd like to write some letters to the girls... for certain milestones in their lives. Like, you know, first boyfriend and, um... their wedding day and first baby and... and... just things like that in case they want to hear my advice or want to feel me. I'd like to be blonde. No, I... um, I wanna have blue hair. And I also want to go to New York one last time and see Les Mis. And, um, Mardi Gras, I wanna be a Grand Marshal. And um, I want to sing on stage with Katy Perry. - Okay? - Mm-hmm. That all seems pretty doable. Does it? Yeah. Maybe not the Katy Perry part, but the other stuff. Yeah. Well, maybe we just tell her like that Katy Perry knows. And just say, "Go, get onstage." You okay? No, I'm fine. When I make my bucket list, I want you to make jokes about it. Sorry. Evie, can you get me the bottle? Yes. This? Yeah. Can I do it? Okay. - Oh! - Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! What? I was joking. I was just joking. Molly, will you tell me when it's happening? It's happening. It's not happening. - Is it happening yet? - Yeah, it is. It just might. I know. Well, that's the whole point, is that it is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Her entire life, she's wanted to be the Grand Marshal of Mardi Gras. And she's got a couple days left and so... oh... Yes. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Thank you. How long does she have? They're saying days. Yes. That's... Indeed. Indeed to you as well. Thank you and a good day. Indeed. I want to get in the fountain. Okay. When? Right now. Call everybody.

Nicole rushed through it the other day, so we didn't get any of the juicy tidbits. Sorry, I was really excited. I may have dropped a couple of details. It's about... It was an article I published in The Atlantic a couple months ago about a British spy - who infiltrated the IRA. - What? Then Random House called, said they wanted to turn it into a book. - Matt! - Boom! Oh, my God, Matt, that's amazing! That's big pimping, dude! That's awesome. Is it like a Jack Ryan, Clancy-type deal or what? No, 'cause it's a real... I eat that shit up. I eat it up. Yeah. Tell me about it. Cheers to you, Matt. Oh! The door. That's probably Peter. That the director? Yeah. Come meet him. Anything in my teeth? No. - Just a little bit of pork. - Oh, good. Hello. We've arrived. Hi! Come in. You have a lovely home. Oh. Welcome. I brought a Sassicaia. Hope that works. I don't know what you're making. Yeah. Sure. That sounds very, uh, expensive. This is Peter Cahill. He is the new director of the theater. Hi. He's amazing. Just like inspiring and brilliant, and blah, blah, blah. His wife's not too bad either. - Very nice to meet you. - Barbara. Barbara. Yes! I'm sorry. Matt, dude, I ran into Dane a couple weeks back. I was in New Orleans for my hotel conference. Oh, yeah. And he was at the Shim Sham Club of all places. Yeah, I gotta call him. I've been so busy. I miss him. Well, I wouldn't rush or anything. It's not like he's got a whole lot going on. The guy's still working the same job at Red Beard's. Nothing wrong with that. Still living in that same little apartment down on Hennessey Street. - This is a friend of yours? - Yeah, he's an old friend of mine and Nicole's. Yeah. He lived on their couch in college. Well, look, we've all had the guests come and they just won't leave. You know, they overstay their welcome. No, we loved it. We really loved having Dane there. He was just, you know, our best friend. They were inseparable. I mean, most of the time I felt like they were married. And I was just a bystander. - His nickname was Goldschläger in college. - Oh my God. It was Dane's drink of choice. He'd have two shots, next thing, he's all emotional, telling you he loves you. It was sweet. Okay. Don't be a jerk, Aaron. I'm not being a jerk. Jesus Christ, I'm just telling a story here. Like the guy would have two shots, next thing you know, he's bro-hugging everybody. He's getting all emotional. He's telling you, "You're my best friend, bro." Right. He's a hugger. There's nothing wrong with that. And on that note, let's clear the table. Yeah. Good. Good. Hey, Danester. Rough night, man? Well, uh, some kid just hurled. Uh, should I get supplies from the back or, um... Yeah. That'd be good. Thank you. Okay. Thanks, boss man. Thank you. There we go. All right. Let's go, let's go. Still doing your joke thing, Dane? Uh, not as much as I used to, but a little bit, Uncle Ted. Have you seen him perform, Bill? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sherry and I have been out a few times to see his shows. I'll be darned. Is he funny? He's very funny. Puts on a nice show. Oh! There we go! Yeah! Yeah, baby. There we go. Hey, Mom, want some cake? Hey, where you going? I don't know yet. Is everything all right? 'Cause, uh, Mom and Dad think you might be going through one of your things. You don't exactly seem all right, Dane. Oh, yeah? What do I seem like, Davey? Uh... Just help me get this in, all right? All right. Well, when you get wherever it is you're going, would you at least call me? Let me know you're all right? Yeah. All right. Oh! Come here. Jesus, dude. Hi. What's your name? Oh, hi. Um, I'm Dane. I'm Teresa. Teresa, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. Do you want to go hiking with me today, Dane? Uh, I was gonna hike by myself today actually. Oh, come on. I could use the company. Huh? Is this your first stop? No. I started like two months ago. Uh, I, uh, started at Guadalupe Canyon. Made my way through Bryce, Hovenweep. Now I'm here. Oh. I did Hovenweep a few years ago. I got lost for four days. No water or food. I was delirious. Holy shit. How did you, um, how'd you get out? I have a friend back in Germany. Every time I take a trip, I send her my itinerary. When she didn't hear from me after a few days, she called park service. Oh. That must have been really scary. Hmm. Scary? Yeah, I was... I was fucking like shitting myself, you know? Like I really thought I was going to die. I understand. Yeah. I would too. You have someone back at home that knows where you are, right, yeah? Charlotte thinks Aaron's having an affair. Does she have any evidence? Yeah. E-mails. To someone named Tina in Arizona. He downplayed the whole thing. Said he shouldn't have been e-mailing her and that nothing physical ever happened, but... What are they gonna do about it? Well, I think if they didn't have kids, then it would be a different story. But she wants to make it work for them. Oh. Will you remind me to call Dane tomorrow? Okay. I love you. I love you. Dane, are you awake? Dane? Right... Sorry, I was... I was, uh, totally out. I made some extra dinner if you're hungry. Thanks. You didn't have to do that. Oh, it's, uh, it's my daughter's favorite. We do a little thing where we FaceTime and make it together. Like our own little cooking show. That's very sweet. Mm. It's, uh... Yeah. That's her. With my husband. They look really happy. That's really sweet. Can I tell you something? Yeah. I asked you to hike with me, uh... because I saw you hiking alone the past couple of days. And, uh... six years ago, I went to Zion alone. Hmm. I was planning to kill myself. I didn't have any reason to live. Look what I have now. Hmm? Things can change that way for you too. You're not as alone as you think you are. Here's my phone number. If you need someone to check in on you, call me. Good night. Hey, buddy, it's Matt. I haven't talked to you in a little while. Just, um, wanted to see how you were doing. - Give us a call when you get a chance. - Hi, Froot Loop! - Hi, Fart Face! - Hi, Stinky Butt! We miss you, Stinky Butt. Talk soon. Hey, buddy, it's Matt. I haven't talked to you in a little while. Just, um, wanted to see how you were doing. - Give us a call when you get a chance. - Hi, Froot Loop! - Hi, Fart Face! - Hi, Stinky Butt! We miss you, Stinky Butt. Talk soon. Oh, yes. Don't give this to children because I put rum in it. There's rum. Do you want some? Okay. I put so much rum in it. Don't give it to children. Okay. - Mom! - Mom! Mommy! Hi, babies. Hi, honey. Ooh, look at you! You look so good. Oh, wow, baby. Thank you. It kinda itches in the back. Does it? Let me see. Oh, your... Well, your hair's stuck in there, so. Can you tie this? Sorry, honey. Sorry, honey. Yeah. Oh, that feels better. Yeah. Better? Okay. Can I have the candy corn downstairs? Yes, you may have it now. Yes! Are you coming, Mom? Yeah, I'm coming right now. I'll be right there. Molly. I can feel you, my little Molly girl. I see you, silly girl. It's okay, Momo. Hi, baby. You want me to come downstairs? Good job. You look like you just walked right out of Woodstock. Trick or treat. Trick or treat, sir! Thank you. Good to see ya. God, I am so mad at them right now I could scream. - What? Why? - Jeannette and Gale. They promised they would be here. That doesn't just piss you right off? I don't know. It's probably hard for them to watch. They're gonna fall away one by one. I'm pretty sure of it. Yeah, not me. Mark my words. By the end of this, you and Dane will be the last friends still here. Would you take that to Nicole for me, please? - Yeah. - Thank you. Ugh. Yo, man. Hey. Hey. Never saw you as a doomsday prepper, Matt. I know. Nicole just keeps ordering this stuff 'cause she wants us to be prepared, I guess, you know, for... for whatever. Yeah. Hey, everyone's around... everyone's around back. I, uh... Did I see Dane back there? Frigging Goldschläger's still living here, man? You guys charging this dude rent or what? No, we're not charging him rent. Dane's pulling us through here. - Yo, ease up, man. - Don't be such an asshole, man. Whoa. I'll give you a pass, man. I know you're going through a lot right now. No, you're not giving me a pass. I'm giving you a pass because you're married to Charlotte who I like. If y'all split up, let me know and I'll drive over to your house and punch you in your face. I'm so ugly now. What are you talking about? People don't look at me when they talk to me anymore. Want me to tell you the story of how we met? The old Burger Palace? We gotta get back to the Burger Palace. Oh, man, that house just had no idea what was going on. Tuesday, around 11:30, I walk into the Burger Palace in Mobile. It's so early for a burger. Well, you know, destiny was waiting. And my heart was pounding for some reason. And then you came up to me and I said, "Oh, you know, I'm new to town." And I said, "Would you show me around?" And you said, "Why me?" And I said the only thing that I could think of because it was the truth. I said you were the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. And you said, "Okay." You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. And you always will be. He did. He turned around all slow and flapped his arms. He looked like a little baby bird. A cute little baby bird. - How do they feel? They feel tight? - Yeah. They're all in. - Can I plug it in? - Yeah. Yeah! Why do we need them anyway? So your nail polish doesn't get all smudged. Oh, my gosh! Whoa! Look at them. It looks like a secret door. It so magical. - Yes. - It looks like a fairy house. - These are so pretty. - Oh, you tap it. Okay, let's do your next lesson. I'm gonna teach you how to iron. No. That's boring. No. Do we have to? Yes. It hurts... - I know. I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, honey. - It hurts. Hey, what happened? What happened? It's okay. I didn't see her little arm was there. I didn't see it. What happened? - Hey. - Is she okay? Yeah. Uh... Hey, Molly. Let's get some water on that, kid. You're mad at me? I didn't do... I didn't do nothing. I'm like the Mona Lisa. I've been framed. Like a painting in a frame. The Mona... No? Okay. Does it hurt? Mm, kind of. Matt. Yeah? We need to tell the girls. When? Now. ♪ Who's gonna see The first raccoon? ♪ ♪ And who's gonna see The first raccoon? And who's... ♪ There's one! There's one. All right. You know what? We're gonna give this one to Evie - because she's in last place. - Five for me. Three for Dane. One for Evie. I have two. You have one. - Two. - Hey, guys. Mom and Dad want to talk to you guys for one minute. You wanna come in? Do you guys remember when we told you all that Mom had cancer? Yeah. Well, and you remember when we told you that we would just tell you anything that was happening? Mm-hmm. Well, we had a long talk with Dr. Felton. Um, and he said... that Mom is going to die. No. It's okay. It's okay, honey. It's okay, honey. - No! - It's okay, baby. No, it's okay. It's okay. Mommy! Mommy! ♪ Hold fast, hold tight ♪ I can't believe you're doing this to me. We can't talk about this now. Okay? - Yeah? See what I did for you? Huh? - Hey, you guys. Yay! Hazel! Hey, Peter. Nice to see you. Hey, Matt. How are you? - Hi! Oh, thank you. Thank you, honey. - Yay. You were great. - Thanks. - You did so good. - What was that all about? Everything all right? - Oh, yeah. That was just theater drama. You're so cute. They were so proud. They loved it. Hey. Hey, baby. Hey. Hi. What? Hi. I read your e mail on the computer. Said, "He's too much of a coward to talk to me." What have I not talked to you about? What is it? What? Were you not talking about me? - Um... - Were you talking about somebody else? I just, um... Who is it? I just, um... I had a crush on someone. That's all. Um... That was... Somebody from the theater? Yeah. You had a crush on that guy Peter? Why'd you have a crush on him? Did something happen? Why don't you just... We kissed. He kissed you or you kissed him? We kissed. Okay, well, I'm leaving. No, you should leave. - You should get out. - What? I saw you crying last night and I read your e-mail. How stupid do you think I am? I know that it wasn't just a kiss. Okay? You're gonna tell me, Matt, that on all of those trips and all of the months and months and months that you spent away from us that you never once... Never once! Never once. That never happened, Nicole. And don't rationalize it. That never happened! How long has this been going on? Not long. How long has it been going on? Not long. I'm sorry. You're such a liar. Matt, wait! Wait! Wait. Can I go over to Mia's house today? Or can she come over? Um... Wait right here, okay? Matt? You okay? Uh, no. No, not okay. You had a husband and a family. And you ruined it all... because you couldn't resist sleeping with some old man like... Matt, stop! Stop, Matt! Mom? Mom, what's happening? It's fine, honey. Stay upstairs. It's just... it's fine. There's just, um... Matt? Hang on. Matt, open the door! Dane, hang on. I'm taking a shit. Matt, open the door, please! Matt! Oh my God. Matt! What did you do that for? I'm so... I... I was afraid that maybe you were... Oh, man. That's an easy fix. I got... I have a screwdriver in the car. It grows in the shade. So we're in the perfect spot for it. And at first it looks quite harmless. But soon, you won't feel your tongue. Your ears will begin to swell and there will be a burning sensation. So here we go. I'm gonna eat some of it now. That is such a pretty sky. Yeah. Let me see. Let me see the star. It's such a bad sun. Oh my gosh. I totally... It looks like a sunflower. Mm, let me see it. Hey. Hi. - Who wants to go to Cafferty's for sprinkled doughnuts? - Me! Yes! Yeah? All right. There's one left, I heard, so let's get going. We have to split it? Wait, I don't want to share. I wanted it to be... Do you love him? No. Do you love me? Yes. Well, I don't really know if it's gonna work. I don't know if it's gonna work. But I'm willing to try. You know what? Um, what do you say we pull a couple of these chairs and make this whole thing a little more cozy. Does that sound good? Yeah. Okay. We're gonna do that. - Hey. - What are you working on? I'm just trying to write something about Nicole and... Um, do you mind running to the store to grab some sandwiches for book club? I thought Charlotte was gonna do that. Yeah, so did I. Apparently her daughter has strep. And then Carol Anne and Tracy also just didn't show up. Yeah, I can take a drive. Okay. Thanks, man. Yup. Matt! Give me back my phone! Give me back my phone. You're posting mean stuff about your friends online I know you don't mean. - They're not my fucking friends! - You said Gale was a fake liar. You said Charlotte... - Fuck Gale! - Stop, Nicole. - When's the last time they came to see me? - Stop. - Give me my phone. I'm still a valid person, Matt. - Yeah, you are. But you gotta take... I don't want it. I don't want it! Goddamn it. Stop! Give me my phone. - Give me my phone back! Give it to me! - Nicole! Nicole. Nicole. Nicole, easy. Matt, please leave. Get off of me, Dane! Matt, I need you to go, bud. Yeah. Why don't you just leave, Matt. Easy. Nicole, calm down. You wonder why I fucked somebody else, you fucking coward! Fuck you too, Dane. Fuck me too. Okay. Why's that? Why fuck me? I heard you two talking about me. Conspiring against me. You wanna take away my phone, my computer, my credit cards. You wanna delete me. You wanna completely delete me! No, I don't. I am still a valid person and you just want me to die! I know that. No. I don't want you to die, Nicole. Yes, you do. You want me gone! You know what? I fucking seriously hate you. I hate you! I'm sorry you feel that way. "Oh, I'm sorry you feel that way. I'm so sorry you feel that way, Nicole." Fuck you! Get out! No. Get out! Get out! I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving. No, I'm not leaving, Nicole. Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. Mol, sorry I'm late. Why don't you... Molly, drop the attitude. All right? I didn't do anything that bad. You've never done anything for me. Okay. Listen, nobody's perfect, okay? Mom always does everything. You might as well get used to that right now. And I don't think you're this upset with me because I'm 15 minutes late to pick you up from school. I think you're mad because Mom is sick. No! I'm mad because I'm gonna be stuck with you! Yeah? Hey. Hey. Pack that up. For what? We're gonna take a trip. You and me. All right? I can't, Dane. I can't. Matt, you need this. And Nicole needs it. I can't take a trip. I can't leave Nicole. Your kids need it. I called Nicole's parents to come in for the weekend. They're here. Just pack the fucking bag. Don't use the F-word. You haven't... That's still a type. - Yeah. - Like be more specific. Okay. Like a warm peninsula. I think nachos are the most fun food because they... It's like a sharing phenomena. And what's the joke? "That's nacho food." Nacho. Nacho cheese. How do you think Nicole's parents are holding up back home? Uh, I don't know. You don't have to stick around either. I mean... I know, Matt. Just so you know, I'm not sticking around just for you. I mean, Nicole's my best friend too. I'm happy to be here. That's true. But I just don't want to leave it. You're supposed to pack in, pack out. Oh. You see that also, yeah? Yes, I see that. That's nice. What? What's funny to you? You just did your hair. I did not. You just did your hair. No, I didn't. It was windy earlier. First of all, they can't even see us. They're not looking at your hair. Second of all, it's weird to just sit over here and watch. So we should tell them that we're here so that they know. So they don't, you know, go skinny dipping or something. Just say, "Someone's over here," so they know we're here. Say something. Tell them that we're here. I'm going to. I'm thinking of what to say so it's not even weirder. Just say, "There are people here." It doesn't matter what you say. There's people here! It doesn't matter what you say. Hey! Now they'll think that we're weird in the forest. - My friend's freaking out 'cause... - Come join us! - ...we were here before you. - We'll go away soon if you wanna wait. - Come on. Come jump. - He doesn't know how. I can jump, but I... not right... My friend can't jump. Come on! - All right! - Go, Dane! All right, Tarzan. Come on! Holy shit. I'm so scared right now, you have no idea. Aah! Whoa! Go! Let go! Hello, I'm Dane. Nice to meet you. Dane. "And in spite of my... So in spite of my... Thank God. I'm a happy woman." I'll read it to you tonight. "'There's no need for me to say it. For even one can see that I'm far happier than I deserve'' added Jo, glancing from her good husband to her chubby children, tumbling on the grass beside her. 'Fritz is getting gray and stout. I'm growing as thin as a shadow...'" That is so funny. Oh, my God. That's... that's... that's... That's so funny. No. No. No! That's... That is so funny. I got it. Hey, there. You Matt? Yeah. I'm Faith. I'm your hospice nurse. Oh. Okay. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Hi, there. - I'm Dane. Dan? Dane. With an E. Dane. Dane is a friend. He's just been staying with us to help out. Well, what a nice friend. Uh, thank you. Beautiful day out, isn't it? - It is. - Yeah. It seems nice. The experts all week long, they were calling for rain, rain, rain. It's been nothing, but sunshine. I was just texting with my girlfriend. We were supposed to go to the movies tonight. The last place I wanna be on a night like this is stuck in a movie theater. Know what I mean? So I said, why don't we grab a six-pack of Corona, and head on down to the beach. Right? Sounds nice. Which... Which room is Nicole in? Um, she's down here on the left, end the hall. Okay. Why don't you go take a little rest and I'll handle it from here. Um... Go sit down and put your feet up. - Okay, Dane, make him go sit down. - Yes, ma'am. Okay. How about we open up a window, Nicole? Here we go. Ooh, let some of that fresh air in. How long has Nicole been like that? The cancer? Two years. No, not the cancer. The way she is right now. Um... I haven't recognized Nicole for four months. And y'all have been taking care of her yourselves that whole time? Yes. Yes, ma'am. Jesus. You poor things. She needs an anti-psychotic. Okay. Matt, as Nicole's body is dying, her mind is distressed. And I know that you want to help ease that for her. We need to start preparing for the end. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. It's okay, sweetie. It's okay, sweetie. I'm here. I'm gonna be here till the end. And it's... it's not gonna be much longer. I promise. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry I hurt you. I shouldn't have left you alone. I shouldn't have left you alone so much. Do you want to race? One, two, three, go! Shit! Oh! I can't!
