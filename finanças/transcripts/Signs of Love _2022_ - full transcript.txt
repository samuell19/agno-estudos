Yo, that's my bike! Yo, I like that bike, nigger. Try and get it, bitch. Hey. Hey. What? Dude, are you fucking serious? What? It's my birthday today, man. No shit. It is? How old are you? 15. Oh, come on. - I want to show you something. - Come on. Yo, no way, dude. Happy birthday, man. Hey. You like it? So sick, I love it. Hold your horses. Hey Sean, can you come down and give me a hand? Be careful, okay? What the fuck is your problem? Hey, did you pay the rent? Yeah, yesterday. Cat food? Yeah. Okay. Hey mom. Hmm. Care if I go ride the bike Uncle Frank got me? Sure, sure. Can you just put cat food out back? Yeah. Thanks. You know it's Sean's birthday, right? Of course, I'm his mother. Just checking. I got him a cake from ACME. You know where that picture of Mom is? I want to get it framed. Uh, yeah, I think it's in my bedroom in the... In the side table. Oh my God, I'm riding. Oh my God. Oh, fuck yeah. I'll be right back. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Seanie ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Make a wish. Frankie, my boy. How have you been? Where did you just come from? What do you mean? I was in the bathroom. Did you just get high in there? No, I didn't get... I had a cheese steak on the way over. I was taking a shit. You ate cheese steak before our weekly lunch? Dude, I told you. I don't want to hang out with you when you're high. I'm not high. Here, use this to investigate. What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Get that fucking hand away from me, you're fucking gross. No, you can compare it to the stink in the bathroom. Come on, just... Michael! Go wash your hands, you freaking pig. Hi Rosie. You're grossing everyone out. There's no one in here. Yeah, well I threw up in my fucking mouth, all right? Go wash your damn hands. Okay, okay. She's pissed. You're fucking disgusting. No, I think she still has the hots for me. Okay, I doubt it. Oh yeah? Why is that? Well, for one, you look like shit. Oh. Yeah, well, get used to it, 'cause you're gonna look just like me when you are this age. Fuck that. Yeah, when I was in my 20s I looked just like you. Yeah, and then what happened? What do you mean what happened? You partied too much. No. No. I had your sister. And by the way, how is Patricia? She's still into banging black dudes? See, dude, I know you're fucking high. You think you're a comedian when you're high. No. I'm always funny. I'm gonna go. No, don't go. Frank, don't go. Frankie, please. Please don't. I mean, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't help it, okay? But I mean, what's the difference between the two of us anyway? Frankie, you sell it, and I smoke it. But it's like no difference. No, just don't go, son. Come on, it's... Stop. Okay, bye Frankie. I'll see you next week, son. Hey. Hey. Hey, honey. Hey mom. Can you go down to the corner and trade this for some cash? There's probably $200 on it. Don't take less than $125. Okay. Thank you. You really shouldn't do that. Do what? Make him trade your EBT card for cash. You know it's illegal? You want me asking you for money all the time? No, I just don't want Sean getting a record. Calm down. He's a minor. And anyway, I'm giving 25 bucks of it to him for his birthday. Come on, Patty. Also, you should see who he's hanging out with. Some of those friends are already trapping. Hmm. How am I supposed to keep up with who Sean is running around with? I don't know. Maybe ask him. I'll do my best. ♪ Look ♪ ♪ Eh, right back ♪ ♪ Back in this bitch ♪ ♪ Pick a fence, backyard, dig a ditch 6 feet ♪ ♪ What you mean, nigger? ♪ What up, boy? Good. So how did that go? Piece of cake.

I know that's weird. I just... I just I think you're really beautiful and I want to know more about you. This is you? Can I see you tomorrow? Have you um, have you always been deaf? Do you hear anything right now? Damn, that's crazy. Not... not the deaf part. Just the whole thing. Do you remember sounds? What sound do you miss the most? Damn. How do you say ear? Just like that?

You want a refill? Yes, please, Rosie. What happened? You know, a little work-related incident. Work-related? Still busting people's car windows out? Yeah. Why are you acting all high and mighty? What are you getting out of those cars anyways? Like, loose change? Whatever, you know. Tools, clothes, random stuff. Wait, wait, wait. Check these out. These are sweet. These are prescription. What do you do with these? - I'm gonna sell the frames. - They're big... Who's gonna buy those? I can get 5 bucks from somebody. You know, one of you assholes broke into my car and busted out the window the other day. For, I don't know what, 80 cents in change? Really? What kind of car is it? Oh, aren't you hilarious? You know, it cost me a couple of hundred bucks to get it fixed? Cocksucker. Just remember that the next time you're busting out people's windows. Thank you, Rosie. I told you.

Come on, even I wouldn't sell those. But I'm not gonna take you. Who the fuck else are you gonna take? One of your crackhead buddies? I have friends. And maybe Rosie. Sure. All right. What's going on with you? What do you mean? You're just not your normal pissed-off self today, that's all. I met a girl. Ah, there we go. Great. What? Just don't get her pregnant, okay? I haven't even hooked up with her yet. What the fuck are you talking about? All I know is I met your mother, I got her pregnant with your sister Patricia, and I did what I'm supposed to do, okay? I manned up. I did the right thing. And boy, was that a fucking mistake. I mean, marrying your mother. I don't mean you kids. That wasn't a mistake. I love you kids, all right? And come on, man, I just don't want you to make the same fucking mistakes I made, that's all. Don't worry about me, all right? Well, then, so what? Is she cute? Yeah, cute? Yeah, she's dope. She's deaf. Wait, wait, wait what do you mean deaf? Is this like some kind of cool lingo? No, like she can't hear, deaf. Really? Yeah, but I mean, it's cool. How the fuck do you communicate with her? She reads lips and then replies with text. Well, I don't know, maybe that's good. She can't nag at you all the time. Jesus, man. You really are just a miserable person, aren't you? What? What's so funny? You remember my friend Sal from high school, the one that owns that painting company? Yeah. Sal banged a deaf chick back in the day. Yeah, but she was butt ugly, right? She wasn't cute at all. But Sal didn't care, 'cause he would fuck anything, right? Just so... Anyway, so what was I saying? Sal. So Sal, he's banging this... This... this girl, right? And the neighbors called the fucking cops, because she was deaf, right, so she couldn't tell the volume of her voice and you know, just look at this face. Just be prepared for that. That's all. I'm just trying to help. Thanks for the great advice, man. As always. That's why I'm here, kid. You remember when I was 6, you'd take me to the ball game after you'd take me to get water ice? Yeah, of course. Best time of my life. That's what I'm saying. I mean, back then you were sober. At least, I think you were. I mean, you weren't a mess like you are now. What's your point, Frankie? What are you worried about? What am I worried about? Look at you. Look at me what? You got to eat something. I'm not hungry, Frank. It's on me. Okay, Mr. Fucking Money Bags. I don't give a shit who pays for it. If I'm not hungry, I'm not gonna eat anything. I just want... I want you to meet my kids one day, you know? I don't want to have to tell them that you died a crackhead. Oh, what did I tell you? I told you no kids. Wear a condom. You... You're just like your mother. You got no fucking sense of humor. I'm... I'm kidding, okay? I'm fine. Here, look, look. You want to see this here. Okay, you happy now? Delicious. All right, don't leave me in the dark now. Tell me about this girl. Is she from the neighborhood? What's her name? Jane. All right, Jane is a nice name. Is she from the neighborhood? No, Fairmont. Yeah, that's fancy. Not really. Bullshit, Frankie. That's fancy. So this fancy Jane from Fairmont, she has you thinking about having kids? Maybe. Interesting. I mean, I'm not saying she's the one. But I think about my future sometimes. What, as a pusher? What is that supposed to mean? You know, I know the deal, okay? I know that I'm fucked up. I know I'm no good. I admit it. You can't. You can't admit that you're no good. You ruin people's lives for a living, Frankie. You know that, right? For 10 bucks a pop, you ruin people's lives and for what? I don't fucking make them do it, all right? Oh. That doesn't matter, son. It's still on you. All right, look, what the fuck do I know? Ah, you listen to me? You're gonna finish this? Make sure to take care. Why are you talking to Stefan? You don't like Stefan? No, man. That little motherfucker is always setting me up. He's already selling out of his house. Really? Well, he's definitely a motherfucker that will pull on anybody I tell him to. He'll sling, he'll collect, and he'll pop someone. You can fucking use him. Just keep him out of my business. Like this business? Is this your business? Hey! Hey, you little shit. What up? Do you know who I am? Yeah. Do you know what's gonna happen to you if I catch you out on this corner again? Yeah. You want to work? Text me. But don't let me catch you out on my corner again. You dig? Yeah. That's a good guy. What the fuck. Keep an eye on that. I will. You better. I keep driving around here and I see rival trappers on my corner. And I know you ain't gonna pull. You ain't about that. But I want you to know this. Stefan is ready to go. Yo, I got to bounce. Hey. Hold it down. Yeah. So, Frank, Jane mentions you have a little brother. Oh, yeah, uh Sean. He's my nephew though. Um, he's like a little brother. But yeah, just re... really smart and a good kid all round. She also mentions you live with him and your mother? Um, no, it's my sister, it's Sean's mother. My mum passed 10 years ago. What do you do for work, Frank? Uh, odd-end jobs, whenever they come up and a friend of mine owns his own business, so I do... I help him with pick-ups and deliveries. Uh, what about a career? Are you in school or do you plan to go to school? Um, I'd like to. I'm not. Just for as long as I can remember I've been taking care of my sister and my nephew, so I just haven't really had a chance. But if I were to go back, I think I'd want to be a juvenile probation officer. Why is that, Frank? I just... I think I can relate with them and hopefully, push them in the right direction. Well, I hope you follow through with that, Frank. What about you guys? What do you guys do? I'm a professional stay-at-home mom. She was a lawyer, but wanted to raise Jane. Yes. And I have no desire to go back. We know. What... what about you, Mr. Stafford? Um, more or less security. Like outside of a nightclub security? No. It's basically cameras. I help develop the systems that enable you to move cameras and view them on laptops and computers. That... that was you? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, well, I was one of the developers. The software was originally designed for buildings, commercial applications. But with the ever-evolving tech boom, the software has now moved into homes and for personal use. It's really not that interesting. But um, my company provides services to a lot of the government buildings around the city and some high-end retailers, too. Oh, that's... I mean, that's really, really cool. Jane, what about you? Jane always wanted to be a doctor. Really? I didn't know that. Well, did Jane tell you she's off to Michigan in the fall? No. No, I mean, that's awesome. I've heard of Michigan. I know that's a great school. It's an excellent school. Well, she got into Penn as well. Why Michigan over Penn? Well, it really wasn't an easy decision. Michigan has a medical professor that's also deaf. And we thought that would give Jane the proper support that she may need. I'm sorry. It's okay. You know, you could have told me about Michigan. You don't... You don't have to be sorry. I didn't mean it like that. Yo. Hello? Fuck. Shit. Patty. Sean! Sean! Get in here. All right. Your mom? Yeah. What did she say? Nothing, dude. She... she says I'm ungrateful. Ungrateful of what? I don't know, man. And that you're a bad influence. That I'm a bad influence? Dude, your mom had me on the corner when I was 15. Listen, I mean you know how we're like brothers, you know, we don't have that uncle-nephew vibe. Just, you know, learn from my mistakes and I'll be the first one to tell you to finish high school, go to college. Just follow your dreams, all right? Yeah. You know, from... from now on, just try not to worry so much, you know. And I know your mom can be crazy. But be a kid. Go skate. Go hang with your friends. I got you, okay? I love you.

Hey, thanks, brother. How'd you get home? Suzie got me. Hey, sweetie. Dumped your stash. Upstairs, too. Why would you do that? Are you serious? You're such a fucking asshole. You act like I'm an alcoholic. You are an alcoholic. No, I'm not. Sean, do you have that cash from the other day? Thank you. Where did that come from? I sold my bike. Yeah, he wouldn't have had to if you hadn't been with your girlfriend all week. Can I not be happy? Oh my God. You made a commitment to us when Mom died. No, I made a commitment to Sean. I never said I'd take care of you. You know, you should really be thanking me. I've already turned you into a better man than our father and his father. I can't do this anymore. I'm moving out. Good riddance. You're gonna keep saying that when I stop paying your rent? You do that, and you'll never see Sean again. Yo, Sean, could you just go upstairs for a minute? You know, I know what you're doing. It's not right. Oh yeah? What's that? You're doing exactly what you did to me when I was his age. Just let him enjoy being a kid. Oh my God, I'm so sick of you making me out to be a bad parent. This isn't about you or me, Patty. You have a good kid up there. I know he's a good kid. I raised him. You fucking didn't. You're not his father, you know. I don't pretend to be. Aw. Sure you don't? Here you go, Frank. Thanks, Rosie. Mike's a no-show, huh? Yeah, I mean... You mind? No, go ahead. You know, the best thing you can do about Michael is just really not worry too much. I know it's easier said than done. Yeah, I guess. I mean, if he's not here or home, he's just under a bridge somewhere. I'll find him later. Remind me not to park under any of these bridges. I mean, I don't even worry about him anymore. I've just been thinking about this girl I've been seeing. Oh yeah? What about? What to do? What to do with what? Well, I like her. Love. That's good. So what are you trying to figure out? How to move forward. Just tell her. No. She's too good for me. You're way too hard on yourself. I don't get it. Why is she better than you? I mean, she's going to college. She's thinking about a career. I mean, she's gonna be a doctor. And she comes from a lot of money. And I mean, I got no plans. You know where I come from. Big deal. What's important is how you treat her. I've dated all kinds of men. Ones from the neighborhood, guys from the mainline. They all treated me like shit. You know who treated me the best? Don't say it. Your father. My Mom would disagree. Yeah, well, I don't want to talk bad about your mother. I mean, she... she was great with you kids, really. But the way she treated your father was a different story. What was she supposed to do? I mean, he's a drug addict. Back then he wasn't. I mean, he wasn't a saint. But he did everything your mother asked of him to make that relationship work and be a good father. He... he... he put food on the table and a roof over your head and loved you kids. My Mom always told me he loved drugs more than us. That's why he's never around. I was best friends with your mother back then. He wasn't doing drugs until after she kicked him out. He... Maybe he drank a little more than he should have some nights, but he was a kid. Younger than you are now with two children. I know he was a good father, 'cause I saw it with my own eyes. We shouldn't talk about it. I'm really happy you two get along like this and meet each other every week. It's really nice you were able to maintain a relationship. You ever thought about maybe not seeing him anymore? What do you mean? I'm just saying, maybe a little tough love would be good for him, you know. Like you meeting up with him every week, it's like he's not doing anything wrong. I think he just needs a push in the right direction. Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know. I know he doesn't say this, because men have fucked-up egos, but he loved your mother. Really. Like for real. First love. Like, you know, like this girl you're falling in love with. Yeah, I just, you know, I just think what if... What if she's not in love with me, you know, like my Mom and my dad? Oh, Frankie. Don't be a wimp. Life's too short. Yeah. See you. I'm off. Yo, dad. Dad. Dad? Frank. I need your help, son. Are you all right? Yeah. I... I just... - I'm really screwed up. I just need something to get my act... Your hand is all fucked up. I just need you to help me. I just need something to clear my head. Can you just help... help me out? No. Why not? I told you I'd never do that. Okay, can you just loan me some money then? No, I can't. Just fucking help me, kid. I'm gonna leave. No, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just... I just need you to help me. Please, just please. Just let me take you to the hospital. They'll get you better. No hospital, I... Can you hook me up now... No, no, no, no, listen. And I'll go. I promise that I'll go with you. I promise. Just, but, just... Can you hook me up? Please? Please? Hang on. Hi, there's a... There's a crackhead on Malborough and Columbus. He's smashing car windows and stealing shit. Okay, thank... thank you. Thank you. I'm gonna grab my purse and let's go. Hey, can we just chill and like maybe watch a movie or something? I don't want to. My dad is upset. Why? He has a copy of your record. Oh. How did he get that? He just can with his work. Is it all true? I don't... I don't know. What does it say? Theft. Assault. Is it all true? Yeah. Why? I mean, it's hard to explain. Why? Look, I don't come from this. Like not many people come from this. What do you mean this? Nothing was handed to me either. Your dad ever try to trade you for crack? No. What are we talking about here? I want to help you. Help me with what? However I can. You can't. What if I stayed here? What do you mean? I went to college here instead of Michigan. We could be together. We could live together. You can't stay here. Why? Penn is better. No, it doesn't have the deaf doctor dude. It's the whole reason you're going to Michigan. I'm not gonna be the reason. Plus, your dad already hates me enough. How do you expect this to work? I'm staying. No, you're not. I'm staying. No, you're not. I'm leaving. No. No. I love you. You love me? How do you know? I can't explain it, but I love you. I don't know what you want me to say. Come with me then? I can't come, Jane. You know that. I have Sean. Then I'm staying. Jane, Jane. Jane, look at me. I'm telling my dad tonight. Why would you do that, Jane? Because I love you. And I know you're better than anything you've donein your past. Well, I don't love you. Yes you do. Frankie. Stop. Stop! How am I supposed to be with a fucking deaf girl? I don't know you. You don't know me. You're just a fucking handicap girl I fucking took advantage of, okay? You're right. I don't know you. Get out. Get out! No doubt. You mind if I light up? No, no. Go ahead. Yo, so uh, what's up with Jane? You ever work that out? No. She leaves for college in a few days. Man. I liked her. You gonna call her? No, I kind of said some rude shit. So apologize. We all say shit we don't mean when we're pissed off. What about that GED? You take that test? No. No doubt. Why not? And why do you care? Just asking. The way I see it, this here can go two ways. Either in jail or dead. "A pessimist sees a difficulty in every opportunity. An optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty." Winston Churchill said that. How do you know Winston Churchill quotes? I literally watch History channel all day. I love that shit. You know what? Why are you still doing this? I know your grandma made you graduate. You know how many times I tried to get a regular job. I'm talking McDonald's, Burger King. No one would hire me. I don't know. You know, shit. I tried. I got plans, though. Right now, I'm just trying to pay my grandma's mortgage she keeps getting behind on, 'cause social security ain't shit. I didn't know she owned that. Yup. That house, though? That's what's gonna be what build my wealth. Property, homie. It took my grandma 50 years to even have the opportunity to be able to own. So, you know I got to keep that dream alive. I don't know no other niggers that own houses. I didn't know you had it planned out like that. You better get that GED, nigger. I appreciate it. Hey, what the fuck are you doing? Nothing. What did you just put in your pocket? What the fuck is this? What the fuck, dude? Are you dealing now? Fucking answer me. What the fuck is wrong with you? Look in the cupboards, Frank. There's not a freaking thing in there. We got no food, no toilet paper. What the fuck is that? Where is it? In my room. You forgot the ketchup. That's it? Yeah. Who gave it to you? Stefan. - Calm down. - It's just oxy. Fuck you, Patty. Yo, Stefan. Yo, what's up? Stay away from Sean. You hear me? Fuck you, nigger. I'm Sean's step daddy. What? What, you ain't know? Me and your sister like this. Yo, stay away from Sean, all right? Fuck you gonna do about it? Like I thought, nigger. I love you. I love you, too. What's up? Woah, okay. All right, man. Just uh... Yeah, just tell Jarvis. We'll handle it. All right, cool. All right, peace. - I've been out here. - You know what I mean? They just try to act like they know me. Niggers don't know me, nigger. That's what I tell them. You know what I mean? I'm good at what I am. Yo, why did you let Stefan do that? That kid was probably Sean's age. I don't give a shit. It's money out of my pocket. The dude's a fucking kid. Plus, I had it handled. Excuse me? Stefan handled it. You see, you're not gonna see one of those motherfuckers on one of my corners again. You feel me? Stefan made sure of that. I made sure of that. What's all that? I quit, dude. You quit? Yeah. I need your whole crew. It's all Willy, dude. He'll take care of you. He needs the income, though. I hope so. We good? As long as that money comes in, we are. All right, I'll see you around, man. I'll see you later. Hey. Hey, I got you a hoagie. Oh, nice. Thanks. Can I come in? - Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. - Yeah, come on, come on. Come on. So how are you feeling? I'm all right, you know. Good days and bad days. Your 30 days up? Uh, yesterday. I still got to go to meetings, I mean... I mean, that's good. Are they mandatory? Yeah, but it's okay. I would go anyway. I mean, I'm done with that shit. I hope so. I mean, I'd rather not find you under a 95 crying like a little bitch again. Yeah, I never thanked you for that. I appreciate it. No, I'm... I'm not fucking around. You did the right thing. So, you know, how's the girl? We broke up. Yeah, I kind of figured. Why is that? Because you're not prancing around here like you're all high and mighty like you were before. At least you still got your sense of humor. Yeah. What can I say? All right, well, I'm glad you're good. I'm gonna head out. No, no. Hold on, son. How are you doing? I mean, about that, are you all right? Me? I'm fine. You sure? Yeah, why? Well, you know, for the last 10 years every time I saw you, you were angry about something, you know, and it was only when this deaf girl came into the picture that you were all positive and smiles. Look, I know that I fucked up with you and your sister. I mean, I had a lot of time to think about this shit. I'm fine. No, just hear me out, all right? I mean, you know, your Mom, God rest her soul, you know, she... she let me back into her life when she got diagnosed with the cancer, you know, she felt guilty, because she blamed herself for my addiction and for being a fuck-up. And so she let me back in, you know, and... You know, I really loved your Mom. You know, I really did, more than anything. I don't... I don't even care anymore. I mean, I don't. I don't want to talk about Mom. Did you know I stole from her on her death bed? I'm so ashamed of that. I mean, I never apologized for that. She didn't deserve that. No, wait. Please. I'm ashamed of that and I've done some fucked-up things in my life. But the thing I'm most ashamed of is how I treated you and Patty. What, dad? You found Jesus now or something? No, fuck that, son. This is not about, you know, steps and recovery or making amends. I'm not even close to that yet. But I want you to know that I know that I was a selfish man and a horrible father, okay? And I'm gonna do everything in my power and make it up to you and your sister. I promise. All right, look, I forgave you like years ago. That's why we still see each other. I mean, good luck with Patty, though. Maybe you can get through to her with your bonding on addiction. Yeah, fuck it. You got to understand. Son, alcoholics are just different, all right? I mean, it's easy to deny you're doing something wrong when everybody you know has a drink every now and then, all right? But for us druggies, I mean, drugs, they're illegal, right? So we know right from the start that we hide when we use. We know what we're doing is wrong. Look, if she wants to waste her life drinking all day, I don't care. But when you manipulate your 15-year-old brother to go deal on the street, and then you do the same thing to your son, that's what I don't understand. Yeah, see, that's my fault too, kid. No, seriously, your Mom, she over... over-compensated because I wasn't around, that she just gave Patty everything she wanted and it just backfired, you know. She has this sense of entitlement. She thinks everybody owes her something. I mean, the only person who owes her anything is me, 'cause I'm the one who fucked up the most. I'm sorry I fucked up with you guys. I'm sorry. And I'm gonna spend the rest of my life trying to make it up to you guys. I swear to God. Just stay sober. It's all I want. That's the plan. Come here, you. Fuck. Oh man, I missed you, kid. I love you, kid. I love you, too. All right. Something must have got into my eye. So you hear I start working for Sal this week? Really? Yeah, yeah, he offered to hire you too, if you want. He did? Yeah, don't get too pumped. It's only 10 bucks an hour. How am I supposed to cover anything with that? Well, you got a million job offers lined up? It's a start. Yeah. All right, fuck it. What else am I gonna do? Exactly. This is his number. Call him. Get on a crew next week. You know, maybe uh, maybe we'll work together. I'll show you the ropes. Okay, cool. The Birds are playing, you wanna... You want to watch the game? Yeah. Come on, come on. You got the ham and cheese? Yeah. Attaboy. Dude, I don't fucking get this math shit. What is it? It just says to simplify the given expression. Can I see? Go ahead. Okay. Three plus parenthesis, three minus eight parenthesis, squared, minus seven. Dude, I used to hate this stuff, too. But math I like, 'cause if you know how to attack the formulas, then you're good. So all you want to do is start within the parentheses first. So it's three minus eight, which is negative five. Then negative five times negative five is 25. Squared means it's that number times that same number. Oh my God, dude. I don't get it. Like I said, it's all about knowing how to attack the formulas. Okay, so we have 25, and now we just go outside the parentheses and work the problem from left to right. So it's three plus 25 minus seven. 21. Exactly. Sean, you're fucking smart, dude. Dude, I just pay attention in class. Now, let me tell you something. A lot of people think this kind of work is for chumps. But it's not. It's... it's my art. This is painting. Not that stuff that Van Gogh and Picasso did. That stuff's bullshit. It is what it is. It stays that way forever. It never changes. This is meant for change. New beginnings. All right? You get a roommate, you rent your room out, you paint it. Maybe you're gonna turn your bedroom into an office. You paint it. Maybe you have a kid on the way. You turn it into a nursery. So you paint it. Each layer of paint is a new beginning. A fresh start. It getting too sentimental for you? No. I just want you to take pride in what you do, man. This is... this is real art. This is God's work right here. ♪ How could I know ♪ How my head stayed ♪ Waking up Okay, "the following are excerpts from the US Constitution, Article 1, Section 8.
