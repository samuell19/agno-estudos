It's a mess now, but it'll be a super flat We'll put the cot here, with a table next to it Here we'll keep the nappies, clean ones... dirty ones... And baby's toilet things All painted white What are you doing? - What's this? - Nothing special - It's a camera - A film camera? I want to take pictures of the child month by month How much did it cost? Two months' pay. Irenka was a bit cross - Moving pictures? - Yes, like in the cinema It's a great idea She can see herself grow up Wrong way round. Like this Turn the volume up He was marvellous Irenka plays this I need flowers. These will do! - Filip, it's the boss's house! - Oh hell! - Name? - Mosz Your wife has mastitis. We'll have to keep her in... ...unless she can get help at home Her sister might, but she works Is it dangerous, doctor? - No - What a pity! I wanted to film the baby - Is it Russian? - Yes, a Kwarc 2 May I have a look? OK. But only for a few minutes Ours? Irenka Have you touched her? Of course! They bring her to me for feeds From a bottle See what a mother I am I can't even feed my own baby I love you, Irenka I love you She's smiling. Can I film her now? She's wet herself No, not naked - Why not? - She's a girl Has someone died? No, Piotrek drives a hearse. He brought the cot It gave me quite a turn Irena Mosz Oh! I forgot to film you coming in - I'll do it when she wakes up - No, it'd be a bad omen Halt! Turn! Form up into two lines Masks off! Good morning - You're fit! - No, I was late The exercise has been carried out, Commander Drop in with Osuch when this is over Masks on! If anyone calls, I'm out I asked you both so you couldn't deny that you own a camera I do I believe it makes films So the instructions say Did you know that our Jubilee is imminent? Yes, the 25th anniversary We expect... ...a lot of VIP's Yes, we've booked the artists This occasion can't just come and go We must record it I want you to film it I've only just bought the camera. I wouldn't know how You'll learn. How did I learn about gardening? From books. And Stasiu? He learnt about stamps from books You have a camera - And film? - No, sir What's our Culture budget? 113,000 zlotys. We could start a club We tried amateur theatre. It didn't work Theatre! Cinema is the supreme art - Who said that? - Lenin So, is it a deal? It's a deal Stasiu, you're the witness Do you always go that fast? Are you kidding? When I'm working I crawl along Do you want a lift, Irenka? She's lovely! Look at this equipment: a projector, a stand, film... Did you buy it? The plant bought it. Director's orders Piotrek, how can I pay you for the lift? I'll buy you a bottle Don't bother Just film me by the van Mum will watch it three times He's going to film me! Take me driving down the slope Why did they buy it? The director wants to film the Jubilee He wants me to make the film. Quite a challenge! Does it have to be you? I'm the only one with a camera You bought it to film the baby Damn, he's driving too fast - Did you get it? - In technicolour! Do you know what Witek asked me? How come I had everything? The baby, you, this place... I said it was all I wanted If you want something badly, you get it It's a form of justice, I suppose You're a good man Look at him! You'd think he was born holding a camera 1,600 zlotys for you. 20 % tax Name? That'll be 2,340 zlotys for you Oh, leave it on the chair - This is for you - Thanks. See you next time Still here? - You're sweating - Of course. How did you like me? - You really want to know? - Actually, take it off You can't go in there. Film them as they come out I'll call you - Watch out! - You idiot! What are you filming? Anything that moves - Where are they? - In there. I missed them going in Shoot my feet going down the corridor Then my hand on the door handle. We'll edit it later Don't be silly Are you filming people going to the toilet? I thought they were all coming out Why not hide in the toilet? That's enough! What was that about? He wanted it nice and formal, the idiot She's asleep What happened? To the mirror? - It broke - How? - I broke it - Why? What were you going to say earlier? - Come here - No Why did you break it? I hit it with my hand and it broke Which one? I saw you leaving the plant. You looked so tiny I'll never forget the way you looked - No, it's too soon - It's a month now - It might hurt - Then we'll stop Look how I've cut the film: first the artists... Then the boss. Is it clear he's listening? I'll run it backwards. The artists... ...the boss The artists... the boss My mum's fainted What is it? I don't know. Help me take her to the hospital You can't take her in a hearse - You're right. I'll get a doctor - I'll go - She can't go in a hearse - I'm calling a doctor. You go up I must get the baby to sleep. She's thrown up again She's come round, but she can't move - At all? - Only her eyes Get an ambulance - I have a stretcher - I'll wait here - Does he mean the hearse? - Yes - How's the baby? - Fine, thanks - What do you call her? - Irenka - Terrible, going in that - She won't come back That's all there is You've done very well I like the bit with the pay-out - Why not add a commentary, though? - What kind? It's up to you, of course But I'd like to know who spoke... ...what the occasion was - It's obvious - Music would help Music... a commentary. Like on the TV news Congratulations. Come back and see me later Now we're alone... Why showthe fellow with glasses? He was just there I want to see less of him Less of him? Better still, I don't want to see him at all. And the pigeons? Let's have them out Three things are out: The fellow with the glasses, the two going for a pee, the pigeons... - And the pay-out - That's four things Let's make it four, then I'll leave the pay-out and cut the pigeons If I were you... ...I'd leave the pigeons and cut the pay-out. OK? You've been making notes, sir? I take this seriously. Look I bought a pen With a light? Watch this You'll like it here - A bit cold in winter - In winter? The boiler room is next door What's in there? You can use that as a cupboard I like it here It's funny howthings work out Will I be doing something? - A film, I mean - You most certainly will I must go to the cinema more often There's this silence in the cinema She starts throwing things at him, but you can't see it It's clever. You don't see him, just things whizzing past him - I'll comb her hair - No, don't Does she have to look a mess? The child is the most moving during the row. When she picks it up... ...and it's crying That bit sticks in your mind. Not the happy scenes Leave it! Nowtake her Go to the window Beautiful! If she'd fallen over, would you have shot that as well? - You should be ashamed of yourself - Why? Nothing happened They're digging up the pavement They're always doing that - I'll go down and get a few shots - Can't you do it from here? You're right. I'll get the tripod That was smart thinking It'll be a documentary film What are you reading? I'm just looking at pictures - What's the matter? - I dreamt a hawk killed a chicken It's just a dream I heard its beak hammering the skull I'll get myself some bread I always wanted to ask you, why do you eat at night? It's a habit I picked up at the orphanage What's it all about, Filip? I mean the films, the club... I don't know One thing led to another And now you're hooked I suppose I am Promise me one thing? That you'll give it up Go to sleep I was just in time. I got it all - There's someone to see you - A beautiful woman She's in the office She wanted to smoke I'll be off then Here he is! This is Filip Mosz, our film-maker Anna Wlodarczyk. I'm from the Amateur Film Federation Your boss suggested that we include your film in our festival We show films of people at work I don't think that's wise. It was meant... ...only for us I'm impressed! Most people make films only to win prizes Take a seat Here are the rules and an entry form I'll expect you in Lodz next month We're not members of the Federation Didn't you apply? Of course Then you're members. Can we see the film? I'll take the call in there Excuse me. I won't be long - Cigarette? - No, thanks Come in a moment, Filip Shut the door. Is it finished? - Just the commentary - And the matter we discussed? No. We'd better not show it Go downstairs Does it make sense? Yes, but why is it hacked to pieces? You ran out of film? Well, it's early days Sure, practice makes perfect. We'll take the film It's great, isn't it? Look at this, Stasiu You've really got carried away, Filip We're getting a phone It's been rubber-stamped - Like it? - That's not what I meant You pay, I deliver My brother-in-law found God at the age of 30 So what? I'm 30 myself - He came to a bad end - What happened? He became a priest Everyone has a hobby. You've got your stamps That's all I have Nothing else Don't win! With those additions, we're in business You'll get top marks I wouldn't know. I had to come out You're too sensitive But you know what you want I've brought bits from a new film. I'd like your advice We'll look at them later Leave it with me Do you know her? She's got a lot of pull. Do you know who's screwing her? This is a load of shit! That freak! He was thrown out of film school in the first year He'll boo the verdict, you'll see How did you get those pigeons? They just happened to be there, so I filmed them What an idea! You just film what's there? - Well, yes - I like that How about first names? - Czeslaw! - Filip Let me introduce the jury Anna Wlodarczyk, from our Federation Teresa Smigielowna, actress Andrzej Jurga, Warsaw Television Tadeusz Sobolewski, The Weekly Film Stanislaw Niemiaszek, representing the Trade Unions And myself, as chairman I would like to recommend for the award... ...The Jubileeby Filip Mosz, from the Wielice Film Club For its originality The way it captures the solemnity of the occasion... ...while peering behind the scenes People in private, pigeons on the windowsill... ...the actors being paid backstage It shows great powers of observation... ...and reflects an interesting modern approach... ...to film narrative - Isn't it his first film? - Yes, it is It'd be a shame to spoil... ...such a promising young film-maker He isn't that young. Let's see you... ...Mr. Mosz My fellow jurors... ...have spoken very eloquently of the films shown They talk of "social commitment", "modern narrative"... ...and "documentation of the times" But I saw nothing of the sort These films... ...were all terrible They reveal a knowledge of life drawn from TV and newsreels Not from personal experience It is the duty of television to broadcast certain things Amateurs have no such duty You can do what you like That's where your strength lies I can't believe your life consists solely of meetings... ...ovations, presentations... ...parades and civil defence exercises On the other hand, I'm sure you could make films... ...about yourselves... ...and about your workmates who really work hard... ...to keep us all fed My colleague has got carried away We're here to give awards to films, not to make speeches That's precisely my point These films don't deserve an award I propose this festival gives none The jury has decided not to award the Grand Prix The second prize and ...Stanislaw Miklosz for The Verdict The third prize and 4,000 zlotys go to Filip Mosz... ...for The Jubilee Anna says you have something to show me If I may - That's all there is - The idea is good - Taken from the roof of the plant? - No, from my balcony at home Why only overhead shots? Yes, I suppose it's monotonous My wife won't let me film outside She's done you a favour The only way to do it is from one angle overhead It'll win you all the top prizes Let's hope so I must go. I want to buy a heater for my flat - It gets very cold in the winter - 'Bye. Thank you - Good luck, Mr. Mosz - Thank you - Everybody's gone - Will you buy me a coffee? Whatever you like. I've never earned so much in my life Know who was right today? Jurga? Yes, those films were bad. Including yours You don't have to tell me Why did you vote for it? To encourage you to go on. It's important for me I know so little about you What exactly do you do? I'm a buyer I travel a lot in Poland buying supplies for the plant It's not bad work What about you? Me? I get by. Doing quite nicely Know what they call me? The Amateur. And they're right I've never been able to settle down I can't commit myself to anyone or anything Time to say goodbye, Filip But we'll meet again? We'll see Yes - I'm blending her food - You'll wake her up I'm sorry. Look, all creamy! What's wrong? Irena... What did you shout at the station? That you were not to win Glad you're here, Stefan. There are quite a few of us now One thing the festival has taught me... ...is to stop filming jubilees - You got a prize though - So? We need a different approach We should make films about people About our feelings, our own experiences Yes, Stasiu Right now? The boss has invited us round They also gave me a diploma, sir Well done. Third prize Second, really, since there was no first prize Now I can congratulate you officially, Filip Can I keep the diploma? Yes, of course I planted this tree when my son was born. He died when he was five This one was for the girl These apple trees... were for the twins You see, that's the way it goes Good buyer, good film-maker. Cheers! No, thanks. I've got too much to do. Well, what next? We're finishing the film about that invention That'll be two films for the plant. Then we must make one for ourselves - What do you mean? - Well, not about the plant - What about, then? - Life - What did he want? - To know our plans - What did you say? - I told him - Why did you give him the diploma? - No use to me. Things will work out I've just had a word with Mr. Osuch We'll let you do what you want. But we must keep a record We'll give you a copy of the film We must have something in writing, a sort of memo For instance: "I'm making a film about such and such..." You mean a script? Call it a script - Where were you? - The boss asked us round Has the doctor seen her? He has Go away. Go! Slam it harder! What's this key doing here? It's a new one! Do you really want to know about me? What have you done? Clear it up! Is that how it was in that film? Have you gone mad? For God's sake, what's the matter? I don't know You wanted me and you got me You wanted a daughter and I gave you one You were meant to be happy - I am happy - No, you're not I can see what's going on Will you let me explain? I did want all those things And now I have them I'm really happy, honestly Then came this film business You know how it happened I realised... ...there could be things worth more than peace and quiet That a man needs, thatln eed... ...more than peace and quiet That some things can matter more than a home and a family What can that be? I don't know, but it can matter more - Do you understand? - More or less But so what? Everything's coming apart Piotrek's mother died, on top of it all - When? - This morning God, we're late - Why are they waiting? - Piotrek's not here Piotrek hasn't come Piotrek! Boys... All over? Yes Can you show me the bit of film you took that time? Piotrek... Why didn't you show up? I couldn't I couldn't watch her being buried - What's wrong with him? - Nothing What did he say? He asked to see the film Filip made Can I keep the film? Yes, of course I admire what you're doing A person is dead, but she lives on here That's beautiful What's this? Can I leave this order with you? We'll see what we can do I feel like going to the cinema. What's on? Camouflage, with Zanussi discussing the film later - Where? - In Freedom Square I hope you deserve my talking to you I act as I do... ...because it's convenient You can say I'm a cynic - That's obvious - What's wrong with that? For you, or for other people? For me, let's say As you may have guessed... ...I don't care much for other people - That's too bad - In what way? Be more specific It would be pointless Your arguments are much too sophisticated for me Who's ducking the issue now? We've changed roles I'd like to talk to you again Meanwhile, if I were you... ...I'd keep a sharp look-out for the rector It's always a good idea to be the first to greet him Don't you think a film... ...about a successful man... ...would have more impact? If I could create a character in a universal mould... ...I'd make a film about him, and no doubt I will one day I made this film because I feel... ...that the odds in the world today are against honest people They seldom succeed Too many of them fall by the wayside Is it enough for a director to believe... ...he's telling the truth? Or should he try to verify it? He must. And there lies our eternal dilemma Wondering if what we're saying is objectively true, or wise... ...without being able to specify how it can be tested Each of us hopes that his film will help someone That it will change society But let's face the facts We are no longer alchemists of the soul... ...capable of changing the world Criteria are relative There are no hard and fast rules We don't know. And this uncertainty is our strength It's what drives us to say things over and over again Differently, more tellingly, more precisely - Did you study another subject? - Physics - Is it true what you said? - At what point? What you said about films Yes, though it's more complicated But basically I meant what I said Would you visit us in Wielice? - Where is it? - Near Cracow We've an amateur film club. They'd like to hear you speak Why don't you call me? I'll come if I can Can I haveFilma ndPolityka? Any kind of razor blades, please - I met Zanussi. I talked to him - And what? He said he'd come to our club He explained why he makes films Why? I can't say. It's difficult Know what? I feel good when you're here What are you doing? Oh, I'm sorry, sir I'd like to know... ...what's going on It's in the script. A film about an old worker of merit Couldn't it be someone else? Why him? Perhaps because it's harder for him to work well Very clever! But a bit dishonest Why? Making a cripple the subject You're using him to make fun of him No, we're not! Sir, wait till... ...you see the film Was that all right, Mr. Mosz? Yes, thank you Very good, Mr. Wawrzyniec You won't be showing this at any film festival - Did you do it? - Yes Warsaw on the line! Booth No. 1 Hello? Yes, this is Filip Mosz What a surprise! I've been thinking about you Anything the matter? No, I just felt like calling you No reason I'm glad - Honestly? - Honestly So am I - Doing anything? - You mean a film? Yes. It's about this man... ...who has worked in our plant for 25 years You'll have to see it. It sounds silly over the phone Filip? - Is something wrong? - No I just saw... my wife - She was standing there - So? - She's gone - Run after her - Are you running? - No What do you do in your spare time? We stay at home My wife cooks dinner We play rummy... - Do you ever go out? - Sometimes we go to the cinema A cafe, more often. Especially on Sundays My wife likes fruit jellies I haven't much of a sweet tooth One way or another, we pass the time - When will you be back? - Don't shout It's my sister's Saint's Day Damn, I forgot So what if that's not where I'm going? Don't worry. I'll say hello from you They've taken all the ladders The train to Katowice will arrive in ten minutes We invite you to come to our cinema on Thursday at 4 p.m... ...to see Camouflage... ...followed by a discussion with the distinguished professor... ...and film director, Krisztof Zanussi The showing is at 4 o'clock. The film is Camouflage It will finish at 5.45 p.m. He's due at 5. Maybe he should have coffee with the director No, Stasiu. We want to show him the club and my film And the audience? I expect about 100 - Go on! With 20 posters in town! - And the announcement We'll need extra chairs, you'll see Zanussi is coming tomorrow Will you come? I want to show him my films I hear you slapped posters all over town - I'll get Wiesia to baby-sit - She can't - Will you come? - And you'll mind the baby? - What are you looking for? - I've found it - Why do you need that shirt? - You want me to look like a tramp? - I'll wash it - Don't bother This is a friend from the club, filming for the first time today A girl I work with With these everywhere, we should get a good turnout Shall we go into the club? People seem to like us. I get on well with everyone at work Does he work here in the plant? Yes, he does Full-time. For 25 years He's retiring soon My relations with the management are very good I've received a few important awards Worker of Merit, for instance A watch... they seem to value me That's it I like the idea A man who finds things harder than others That's how I see it. But everyone says... ...I'm making fun of a cripple You're not making fun of anyone Who funds you? The plant They vet the scripts! Someone has to approve the scripts. Mine too Do you know Jurga at TV? Have you been in touch with him? No, nobody has seen the film yet Why don't you write to him? This is our director This is Mr. Zanussi, sir Pleased to meet you What have you been watching? Mr. Mosz showed me his films The one about the cripple is interesting I thought I'd made myself clear, Mr. Mosz - May I invite you to my office? - It's a bit late - Just a small welcome - People are waiting - Have you seen Irena? - I haven't Does a Mosz live here? A telegram. Sign here, please - I have no change - Don't worry I thought it was for me. It had only the surname "Letter received. Will call Thursday, Jurga" I've read it - Is she the girl you rang? - Who? Jurga! Jurga is a man, and he's bald. He selects amateur films for TV - What's today? - Wednesday It's Thursday tomorrow. I'll wash up No, thanks. Go on reading This is Jurga. Zanussi told me you've got something new Yes, I showed him I'm doing a programme on amateurs. I want to see your new film - Can you hear me? - Yes, very well Good I've finished the film you saw at the festival The one Zanussi mentioned And I'm working on a new project When will it be ready? - In about a month - OK. But no later What's the new film about? An outing - A work outing - What? An outing! Good. See you soon Thank you. Goodbye Why are you yelling? - It's a good line - I don't know. He started What outing were you talking about? We want to film the trip to Ojcow and Auschwitz - A documentary - Good idea I might go with you Lucky the boss didn't come We've got ourselves a film! - When you shot those bottles... - Were you scared? Yes Don't worry We'll get the sack. I'm sure In Kafka, this bus would fly over the fields... ...and no one would get out - But it won't? - Probably not, Witek Shit! I'm scared, Witek You'll manage. If I were going, I'd never come back Look! Shit, you're in for some journey I'm worried about you, Mr. Mosz Why? You could be heading for a fall But you know what I'm doing Of course. You don't fool me - You're on your way to the TV? - Yes - What are you taking them? - Everything The dwarf as well? Yes. I want to showthem what things are like in our plant Let me tell you, then. We're buying a new camera - A bit bigger than yours - 16mm? Yes. The girl from the Federation helped me She's very fond of you I thought I recognised Pieczka in the hall The doorman wouldn't let him in! Did you bring all your films? The three I mentioned on the phone Are they finished? I was up all night editing them Just a second. Our Current Affairs producer would like a word with you Mr. Mosz, Mr. Kedzierski from Current Affairs I think we should sit down - You'll see me there? - Of course Mr. Mosz, we've had the following idea We want to do some features... ...on small towns and their inhabitants We're interested in culture, housing, community schemes, and so on You've already done our town on television Onlt's a Knock-Out That's even better We go back to the town after a year How does it look today? Which of the then future plans have come to fruition? You want me to do that? No harm in trying. At first, just short reports We'll supply the film. You've got a 16mm camera? Yes, I have Good. Come back after you've seen Jurga - Is the material here? - Yes I'll be back in the evening Very good Was it all your own idea, Mr. Mosz? - No help from the wife? - No, it was mine The outing is a bit overdone Drunks and Auschwitz... it's too strong I'll buy the pavement. But you must let me have the dwarf The boss isn't too keen He's forbiddem me to show it But it's not just about the plant. It's a broader issue - Well, yes or no? - Yes Doing business with Kedzierski? You know, for that TV show... ...they did up the front of the town. The back remained as it was Here's your stock. Film whatever you want I'll take only what suits me - Does that seem cynical? - No Itisc ynical A film director once joked that he was a civil servant Actually... he was right Give me 25 minutes, OK? A nut-case. You know him? Yes. I've met him He was at the festival. Throwing bits of film all over the place Maybe you'd like to be an artist? - I don't think so - Thank God! Ania? It's Filip Could we meet? I'm in town What a pity! Can I call you some other time? Yes, OK Hello - Where is the baby? - With my mother What's going on? Nothing.

A friend A friend! That's what's going on No, not that You've broken her toys Why now? When things are finally working out for me When I'm beginning to understand what this shitty life is about I did it for you two Why now? - I want something else - What? What we both wanted at the beginning A bit of peace and quiet Rubbish! You just don't love me I wish I didn't What's that? Go away! "Your film will be shown on television... "...next Saturday. Regards, Jurga". I told you you'd be all right There's more to come I'm now working for them... ...on a follow-up to that TV show Look at that Beautiful! Know what it is? A zoom lens Look, you screw it on like this... You put the hood on... - How much does it cost? - 16,000 zlotys Shit, that's amazing! Now I zoom in... Like the professionals, man! - Look, the hearse! - Piotrek! It's three months since he went away Well, let's get cracking I hope no one interferes Lead me! That was terrific Isn't it awful here? Look! Here she is in a long shot And in close-up In order for it to match, I'll have to edit it That kid of yours is pretty When you edit this... ...remember that when a long shot is followed by a close-up... ...the subject must face the same way. Understand? It's starting! I'll pour the drinks I'd like to show you a film by Filip Mosz of Wielice He told me he started the club himself... ...thanks to the council and management at his work 26 years have passed since I came to work here It just so happens that I love my work I've never been late... ...or missed a single day's work in all these years Things were rough at first My first pay packet consisted... ...of 500 zlotys. Later it went up to 720 Things are all right now I've just had an increase of 400 zlotys Clearly, I'm appreciated On Sundays we sleep late My wife cooks lunch and we play rummy Sometimes we go to a cafe My wife has a sweet tooth so she always has a jelly I'm not very fond of sweets But we get on, anyway We have a little chat People seem to like us, though we're not from these parts Could you go to him, Mr. Mosz? It's been so long we feel part of the family Are you all right? You've done it beautifully, Filip Really beautifully! I was so moved I had to come out I want you to knowthis is only the beginning On Sunday you'll see another of Filip's documentaries He's dragged everything out into the open as it really is Here's to you, Mr. Wawrzyniec! Why has your wife left you? You're so famous now I don't know. She's probably right It was inevitable - Did she take the TV set? - No I'm sure she'll come back Come on, Filip, sing! Hello, gate! You'll be on the box on Sunday Filip, you're so clever. My God, how clever you are! Six months ago you had nothing Now you have everything - You make films. You're free - In what way? You're on your own. You've got rid of Irenka and the kid You're so clever, Filip! They're beginning to showthe facts on TV nowadays To think that first film on our town was for TV too! It's the trend We all watched Kryska's mum lives there. She almost dropped dead - Have a cheese sandwich - Thanks As we were saying, Mosz. We've got problems - Will you be in later, sir? - In half an hour Stasiu, will you wait for me? All my life! He'll have to go - Who? - Osuch Who's responsible for cultural activities? - The Works Council. Osuch - Oh, my God! We won't do anything drastic He just won't get re-elected He'll retire early Because of the film on the dwarf? Or the documentary? The documentary, of course. Though the dwarf didn't help Let me be responsible for what I do You're young. You can make mistakes It wasn't a mistake, sir. I did it because it's the truth Come for a drive? - Where to? - Just a drive Sir, did you bring me here to admire the view? Why are you sacking an honest man? Because of my films? You didn't improve the back of the buildings People can live in pigsties as long as the front looks good For drunken outings and inviting the artists, you're first in line But to give Wawrzyniec more than a fruit jelly would be too much - Stop shouting - I want to shout! Go on, then. I'm all ears You're sacking Osuch It's more serious than you think Osuch would retire anyway The works clerk and the architect will have to go, too The money we received for that TV competition... ...was needed for other things than to smarten up the town We had to rebuild the slaughterhouse. And we needed a nursery school We started building it. But because of your film, we'll have to stop Unfortunately, our needs and what we are allocated... ...don't tally - But one can't voice these opinions - Maybe Definitely. Community affairs... ...can't always be made public Before opening your mouth... ...you must think of the damage you can do - You must be well informed - I want to be. People ought to be They're not mature enough So it's back to square one I'm doing a doctorate in economics I've had to study law, two languages, sociology... One must be informed What's your next film about? The brickworks. It's good They haven't made a brick for months I'll tell you why It's a small plant. Local supplies of materials have run out But jobs must remain. So the men are employed... ...cleaning the town I know. But why build the factory there in the first place? Have a look It's so simple. The world can be beautiful People live and love You should look at that, too Your films are so bleak and gloomy I see Only nature can be shown as it really is Maybe - Is Witek in? - No, just Mr. Osuch Would you like some coffee? What can I say? Nothing. I know how you feel I could tell you it's not your fault, but I won't The matter is far more serious You must realise that this will happen again And you must carry on If you feel you're right, nothing else matters You'll never know who you're helping Who you're working against Like you didn't know now. You'll help some, harm others You're sensitive, so it'll be tough But you must obey your instincts Something good has awoken in you Hang on to it I've grown very fond of you I'm proud of you We've all come to believe in you You can't do anything for me It's beyond you. Forget about it Oh, here's Witek! Witek, wait! Witek, where's the film? The one about the brickworks I put it on the train - What time does it leave? - 3.30 Hey, there's a chain! You'll have to sign a chit - The one who sent it - You sign it - What did the boss tell you? - Nothing You'll expose it! You'll ruin it! Go on! Get it! You've ruined it! You stupid bastard! You forgot to put out the bottle - What's today? - Sunday She woke up at 4 in the morning I was eating bread That was a year ago It must have hurt a lot She was all wet I had to carry her I could hardly walk I left her in the hospital Some woman in labour screamed. That frightened her I walked up and down outside the hospital for hours Then she opened a window and we talked, but not for long In the morning I bought some vodka and went to work
