Did you hear that? Wake up! Sergeant, wake up! Sergeant! We heard something, Sergeant. Move. Pretty noisy for an American patrol this close to our line. Could that be ours? Should we give the signal? - Yeah yeah, wait. [distant] You said that an hour ago. That’s English. [distant] Watch for itlaian mud -How many more hills are we gonna have to walk on? Americans. Americans, get ready. Quickly! - I should have joined the Navy How much further? I’m tired. - You two, shut up, we’re almost there. Sergeant? I think we’re lost. Perez? I know the way. Hill 193 is that way. Hill 253 is that way. I said I know the way. - Hey Sarge, can I have a smoke? - No. How about after we resupply them, then can I have a smoke? Cover, Cover, Cover! We’re done, We’re done. Hey, We’re done! Stop! Stop shooting! Richter, Koster, forward. the others, keep an eye out. - Good shot. You saw that? - Of course. Is Pritchard breathing?

They’re Hit! Shut up! Disarm them See the stripes, that’s the leader, he’s mine. What are you gonna do? Shoot me with my own gun? You understand English? Russian, yes, but not English. That’s yours, get his stuff and look for cigarettes. - Yes sir. My wife made me that. Wife. Wife. Nazi bastard. Now back to the camp. Before they bleed out on us. Understood? Yes Sergeant. -Good Go, you first, move! Go, forward! Go, go, go! Koster, let’s go. That’s..his damned... That’s his brain. Forget it. We have to move on. Go, now! How can you ignore that? That he's damned dead! You’re treading on very thin ice, go with the others. I can’t do that. I can’t do that to others. This isn’t right! Stop it! We have to get out of here now, and I have to report you. It's not right! MOVE! Take that rock, down there, and put it up there. On your right, there's another rock. Put it up there. Did you hear the shooting? That was a Tommy gun. How do you know what a Tommy Gun sounds like, Freder? Don’t you know the difference? Tauber, start paying attention to everything, yeah? We are now in the real war, my friend. Morning boys! Morning Mueller. Did you hear the shooting? The Anglo-Americans have awakened. They are not Anglo. That is what we called them in school. They have niggers and Jews in their ranks. And redskins, like Winnetou. Karl May? - Yeah. Exactly, Karl May. We will see real Indians with feathers, war paint, and spears. Spears? Yes, now- [In Polish] I thought it was going to break. What’s going on with you now, Bolek? My head hurts from your childish talk. No. You have a headache from drinking. I should take the bottle and hit it over your head. Want to get caught again? I’ll drink the Mukkefuk. Shit. Damned Slavs. I don’t think the Americans are the only ones with savages in their ranks. What? I almost forgot. - No, no, later, later, later, later, I- Stop it! What's that? No, Hey. - Stop it! I wanna see. What's that? You don’t have to know. Let him see. What's that? Yeah, yeah. Where did you get these? Good friend from Napola. Oooh, a very good friend from Napola. Sergeant Artur. Yes sir. Come over here. Come to this side. Thanks. Now listen. Look, here is Mount Rotundo. Yeah. -There, yesterday, Ewald saw with his squad, an American. How many then? One. One? Now we’re supposed to go out there. and check to see if that was a single scout. or we’re in for more shit. You remember this area, right? - Yeah, yeah. clear. We were there last week. - Of course. Yep. From there, we secure the area from here to the hill. Once we have that secured, we move forward to the hill. From the hill, we will have clear sight to Mount Rotundo. -Yes Let’s go and see what’s going on up there. How far from here to here? 2 Kilometers Alright. Yeah? -Yes. Now, here. Here, for my Petra. As always, Mr. Brander? -Yeah. I don’t mean to question you, Staff Sergeant, but you do this every time. Yeah and? I will keep doing it. Have you gotten a letter from your wife since we’ve been in Italy? Shit. No, not yet. But it should happen. When I was in Russia, I got a letter every day. But now, It feels like the last one came a hundred years ago. Unbelievable. -Damned shit here. Yeah, things will be fine. Yeah, who do you want on the, on the patrol? Yeah, I don’t think this will be that dangerous. Let’s take the young ones. the ones who are wet behind the ears, they could use the experience. Yeah. Yeah, I know we don’t have a lot with experience, but we should at least have one with some who we take along. Yeah. Bolek the Polack? Yeah, Good. Okay, then I would say, let’s get ready, and in five minutes, we start out. Five minutes. Look at those knockers. Two hands full! - Oh yeah. What is she wearing? -Not much. Show me. (In French) C'est la Dessous. Dessous? Underwear. Reconnaissance patrol! Halbrock, Mueller, Tauber, Bolek, get ready. Yes Staff Sergeant! Mueller, Mueller, Mueller, Help me! No, thanks. Bolek, did you hear the old man? Is there a problem? No, Sergeant. Then get ready, please? Yes. Give them back! -Let me have one? No, give them back! What are your fighting about? Show me what you've got there. Show me! Dirty, dirty. What are you laughing at, Mueller? Nothing. Yeah? Then get ready and be quiet. Whose are these? Whose are these? -Mine, Sergeant. Save it for later, yeah? The old man doesn’t need boners on this patrol, understood? Yes sir. -Yes sir. Understood Mueller? Understood. Then get ready, quickly! Let’s go! What is taking so long? Please! Come here. What’s going on, when are you going to be ready? Go! Go! Go! We don’t have time to waste! Tauber, did you not think to bring your rifle? This is unbelievable, damnit! You want to forget your rifle Bolek? No. If it- -Sergeant. If it were up to me, I’d rather have a civilian volunteer on the patrol than a drunken Polack. Don’t shoot us in the back when shit gets hot. And keep the Mukkefuk hot. Happy hunting comrades! Four? Six! It’s Ewald and his boys. Brander. They sent you out? Yeah. That one American your boys saw at Mount Rotundo yesterday. That doesn’t make any sense. I think we just solved that. Good, Ewald. Well done. -Yeah. Go on, move forward! -Ah shit! Again, he falls on his face. I told you he won’t make it. He will make it. You, and the Mexican, help him up. Move! Come here. Help him. Hey Richter, wait a moment, yeah? What do you want, Artur? What do you think? Come over here. Put your hands up. Hands up! Hands up I said! Put your damned, Put your damned hands up! Hands up! Fuck You! What did you say? Let’s see, what have you hidden here? Yeah! Camel! Thanks! Artur, are you done? Yes, Staff Sergeant. Man. -Sorry! Good luck out there, Brander. A little short staffed, your squad? Yeah, that’s what I have. They don’t send me any more. You want one from me? I’ve got one. Which one? The little one. Koster. Koster! Come here. You’re going with the old man. Yes, Sergeant. Fall in between Tauber and Bolek. Move forward. And pull yourself together. -Go, Go, Go, Go! Yes, Staff Sergeant. -Hello. “Yes Staff Sergeant” Attack formation. Move, Now! Enjoy the smokes. Thank you, Ewald. Men, march! -What happened? I’ll tell you later. Remind me, Sergeant? Is it our job to kill the Americans or to cuddle with them? Shut the fuck up! Someone stood here when the round hit. Yeah. Could have been there. But now they’re in a thousand pieces. Move on, forward. Halbrock, what are you doing? He is looking for spears and arrowheads. Dead American. He might have something I can use. Don’t touch him! Use your head! Do you want to die from a bullet, or from an infection? Sorry. Keep it moving dammit! Halbrock, didn't they teach you anything in Napola? [singing] That costs three day’s pay, so rich, so rich. We said goodbye. We say- -Mueller, stop singing yeah? I don’t want to fucking hear Lale Andersen. Unless she’s moaning as I fuck her. Understood? Yes sir. Keep your intervals. Closer to Bolek. I’d rather be closer to someone from the Fatherland. Kid. You stupid kid. You dumb kid! -Stop it! Yeah? Bolek, Bolek. You serve only yourself! -Hey! Shut your mouth! What are you doing there? What do you mean? You want to overrun the Americans? I’m always prepared, Mueller. I won’t make it easy for them. Both of you toddlers, shut your mouths. We’re dealing with Americans, not savages. Did you hear that? No savages. I am not trying to question you, Sergeant. but, but, aren’t the Americans savages? They have cowboys, gangsters, and tommy guns and real redskins in their army. You've read Karl May, huh Halbrock? Yeah, yeah, but they have them, you have seen them, right? I haven’t seen tomahawks or mohawks if that’s what you mean. Everything you know about them, you got from your books and movies. If you want to hear something about real savages, I’ll tell you stories from Stalingrad and the Ivans. Yeah. The only thing the Americans are good for are their cigarettes. Can I have one please? Are you joking? Shut your mouth. Yes sir. Man-kiddos, are we still in Kindergarten? From here, stop with the bullshitting! Man! Hey men. We have to scout that area behind the hill. Keep your eyes open. It could get really dangerous. Halbrock, Mueller, get your grenades ready. Yes sir. -Yes sir. Questions? What’s behind the hill? Valhalla. That’s what we have to figure out, my boy. Should we look for mines? -No. Yes sir. Artur. Does that look safe to you? I don’t know. Give me the binoculars. -yeah. I don’t know, if there are Americans, by any means I can’t see them. Looks pretty shitty. Yeah -I don’t see anything either. Mueller. Move over to that bush, and look around that hill. Go. Hey man, give me your grenade. You need both hands. Okay he says there is nothing, we can move on. Where did that come from? Somewhere over there. The old man is hit! What are you doing asshole, you can’t see anything! I do what I am supposed to do! You’re giving away our position! You stupid kids, you don’t know anything! Comrades! Koster. Koster! Bolek! You cowardly pig! You always were a coward! Shoot me if you want. I've had it up to here with your fucking war! Comrades! Comrades! Comrades! Comrades! Rowe, god damnit! I said cease fire. How many did we get? Sarge, How many?! - Quiet! Leo? Le- Quit scratching your nuts. They’re biting. - I don’t give a shit what they’re doing, just get down there and make sure the krauts are down. Hey, Take Rowe and Joe with you. Pick up your dogs, Hayseed Joe! On Me, Come on! Lattie, Enis. Let’s get down there and make sure those krauts really want to surrender. Might be that squad from yesterday. You’re the Sarge, Sarge. How about we get down there and see. That’s a great idea. Geronimo! Stay on that gun. What the hell’s your deal Rowe? They’ve thrown up their goddamned hands! His face was blown off, I was doing him a favor. Go. I swear you can’t do anything right, can you? Make it one bullet next time. Goddamned shit!

Halbrock, save your strength, they got him. Sergeant! I’m hit! -Yeah. I’m hit! Congratulations on your wound badge. Goddamnit, they’re still alive. Halbrock. Leave it. - Lattie that kraut’s trying to pull a fast one! I see it, I see it. Don’t you all know when the war’s over, Fritz? - That one still has his gun! I see it! Enis, Worry about them! Come a ze here! What are they doing with us? -Maybe they will make us to fight for them. Polock Polock Still breathing? Afraid so. Hey Geronimo, you shot too damned low! -Enis! What? No sense keeping it down now. Chief’s gun already telegraphed our position to every kraut in San Pietro. Just stifle it. Leo. Joe. Take care of these krauts. And I don’t mean shoot them, Joe. -Yeah, yeah. Polock. Alright pal. Polock. Hands up high! Hände hoch! What are we waiting for, Sarge, should we plug them? Plug em? Yeah, yeah, I’m for that. A few less Krauts to worry about. Not German? Ahh -Whoa, Rowe, we got the right patrol buddy. -You big stupid son of a bitch. He probably murdered who he stole it from, anyway. Hände hoch. Aww Poor baby. Some Übermensch you are. Joe. Joe. Joe. You’re a big scary Pollak, we get it, okay? Okay. Rise and shine Fritz. That has to be an 88. You all gotta act sarge. What’s the plan? Sarge! We gotta get these krauts under cover, and get some medics up here. Are you serious? I say we end their misery and go home. Shut the hell up Rowe! Take these three prisoners, and get back to battalion. Oh come on, why me? -I’m not gonna argue with you Yankee Doodle. Now get these krauts to cover and get some medics up here. [Polish] Scum Nazis.

[Polish] They captured me in the battle of Kutno. [Polish] They made me choose Wehrmacht or camp. [Polish] They made you choose Wehrmacht or camp? [Polish] Yes. They got a Pollack too? Feels like I’m looking in a mirror. [Polish] Do you understand me, brother? I had to choose- [Polish] I am not your brother! [Polish] You should have chosen the camp. Lets go! Schnell, schnell! Lattie, Joe! Take that old man back to the cave! Halbrock, I’m telling you, the Americans are better than Ivan. Yeah? Don’t worry, Don’t worry. Yeah? Don’t worry, Halbrock. Rowe, get the fuck over here. I will if you quit picking at your nutsack for one goddamned minute. You get them bugs on me, I swear I’ll kill your Irish ass. Speaking of that, Sarge, we gonna kill these krauts or not? Go! Come on. Come on. You got this. Where are we going, huh? Are we going into your bedroom to cuddle, asshole? I can't understand you. Sweetheart, Do your bitching to him. Yeah. You must be a good kisser, huh? Hey, hey, next time. You gotta aim a little higher buddy. Okay? Really? -Yeah Go. Get on! Goddamn He’s fuckin’ out of his mind. Hey, you, hog-face. Shut up! Just be happy we didn’t get to you first. You swines! Slow down. Hold on, Hold on, Hold on What. My cock. Jesus -Are you kidding me?

I get the mechanized dandruff from this pretty little Itai bitch. And now. I’m fighting two wars. Yeah that’s what you get for not giving me a turn. Well then you’d have the bugs now, wouldn’t you. Okay, Fife has a bump on his head but he’s okay. He’s not leaving that gun. He will soon, your watch starts at 1200. Yeah, Yeah. -Yes. This is what we were looking for, a cave with five filthy Americans? We actually found them, Staff Sergeant. Hey. Shut up. Artur. Do that again kraut. I’ll end your misery real fucking quick. Hey Rowe? He scared ya. -He ain’t scared me. He scared ya! -He ain’t scar- Keep them bugs out of my face you dirty Mick. And now we’re babysitting them. You know they destroyed my country? Joe, you’re from Chicago. Hegewisch! And my parents are 100% Polish. Okay, it’s still my country. -Alright Joe. Alright, your watch starts early, okay? Really? Come on, that’s an order. Let’s go.

You were right. I think it’s their first time seeing an Indian. Did you expect a tomahawk and a headdress? And spears. Probably reminds them of the Indians in the movies, Right? Stagecoach, Drums along the Mohawk? I was a single man trying to raise a little girl. Y’all think I had time for stuff like movies back in the civilian life? Rowe? What about you? Uhh Before we shipped off I saw that uh. That sappy love picture with all them Krauts in Africa. Casablanca? Yeah, that’s where it was at. Funny thing is, a few weeks later we was in Casablanca. Rowe. The movie’s called Casablanca. Look, all I remember is that the guy. he had that uh, colored piano player, right? Yeah, thats Bogart. -Yeah. He uh, Yeah. He uh. He didn’t get the girl in the end. So what? It just ain’t right. You can’t watch Bogart? I could watch him in anything. You guys ever heard of Gary Cooper? Sergeant York? Now that. That was a hell of a picture. -That was a good one. That was a good one. -Yeah He was gobbling at the krauts. And he'd pick them off. Oh my gosh. Red Sox! Dodgers! Come on up, Enis. Name’s not Enis. Alright, well. What do you got for me boy? I’m here to tell you guys to keep your eyes and your ears to the North. There’s a possibility of a counterattack coming from San Pietro.

Well, he’s supposed to bring some medics up for these here Krauts. Well. All I know is there’s a possibility of a counterattack from San Pietro. So stay alert. Alright, Alright, what you got for me?

Give me a sip. -These are our trinkets Give me a sip! our trinkets? -You don’t know about fraternizing with the enemy? Hey, it’s just a sip Rowe, not a big deal. When did you become so tender-hearted, Lattie? Give me a sip. He’s my prisoner. What? -Ah, I’m not doing this shit. Up on the hill. I aimed for the one in the middle. My bullet. My prisoner. Understand? Get your own. Ha. “My bullet, my prisoner” Yeah, I understand. No, No, No, No! Hey, hey, hey. what are you doing, what are you doing hayseed? -You ass! Stop it! I’m tired. Come on buddy. My bullet, my prisoner, right? Rowe, give me the bottle. Rowe. Give me the bottle. You’re going to wrestle me over some krauts? No, I’m not gonna wrestle you, I just want the bottle for myself because I’m a fucking alcoholic. Ya piece of shit. Shut the fuck up! And don’t fucking start with me, I swear to God. Hallelujah. Coming of the Lord. Grapes of wrath and stone. Glory. Glory Hallelujah. Yeah so we were uh. Sitting around the bivouac. About 100 miles from a Kraut. Nothing but sand anywhere. So we come over, you know, see if he needs anything. and he’s dead. Dead? Yeah. Dead. As a doornail. Wasn’t no rhyme or reason to it, he was just dead. What happened to him? So apparently later they found out, that there was some kind of uh, dogfight or something. On the other side of the continent, that fired his gun off and the round reached our position and hit him. Was it an American plane? What was it? -Why, Why does it matter what kinda plane it was? It matters. It matters. -No, It doesn’t. Think about the fuckin’ odds of that. A bullet coming and just spontaneously hitting ya. I mean that’s- I couldn’t’ sleep for nights, it- It was a strange one man. It’s alot. Here. What is that? Did you shit in that? What is that? I don’t know, I just cook it. No, if you shit in it, I don’t want it. Come on, you’re 100 pounds, you need to eat more. Alright, alright, well, thank you. Is it bad? I’m not- Oh my Lord. -Goddamnit Rowe. Yeah, this one’s not so good. Glory, Glory Hallelujah. For I am marching, home. Rowe. Can you give it a rest already? Come on, get in here. Smells like shit in here. Yeah, it smells like you. Ah, little injun’s still sleeping huh? Damn redneck. Leave me alone. Redneck? You’re the one whose neck is red, boy. Alright settle down. What’s all that gunfire out there? Anyone who wants to fight for this country is crazier than a rat in a tin shit-house. Are you awake? Sure. The American lost Petra's - Petra’s letter. No. He has - he has the letter, trust me. Maybe you should sleep. No, no, I can’t sleep with this under any circumstances. While we were destroying ourselves in Russia. Some guys froze to death in their sleep. Peaceful faces. Just how they wanted. When you sleep. You just drift away and you feel nothing. Did you also try that when you were wounded? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. For days I played dead with that shitty gas mask on. Every time I woke up. I was surprised. Sometimes. I thought I was dead, and, woke up in hell. Not- not Valhalla? No. No. There was too much pain to think about that. While I was getting my ass stomped in Russia. You were warm in Africa with your balls swaying in the wind. And now, we travelers of the world are laying here together in our last hours. Poetic. Isn’t it? Ah, Jesus, Maria, and Joseph. I shit my pants. and didn’t even feel it. I have to get rid of this stink. Shit. Piss. Semen. Sweat. Hair grease. Death. Are there any good smells that come from our damned bodies? My God, how- how long does it take to die? What are they talking about now? I don’t know, I don’t speak German Rowe. You know what we’ve got to get up in here? We gotta capture some Frauleins. Why, so you can get your crabs again? Or, what’s- -Does it matter? I already have crabs. I mean- What are you talking about? We did capture some Frauleins. Oh, the- oh yeah yeah yeah yeah. Joe, check this out. Aha. Oh my God. Okay, we got a couple of hot ones here. Wow. I grabbed this off the little one. Imagine? Like a couple of trains. A train? Yeah, look at those cabooses. I need a better look. What does that mean? Light!, I need light. Ain’t that a church candle? So what? So what? You’re always talking about how these krauts steal this and that. You go and take a- a candle from church? Why do you care if he has a church candle, Rowe? When the- when the fuck did you care about the Itais? I stole a bottle, he steals a candle, who cares? Who cares? I don’t care. Let’s just call a spade a spade. Give it a rest. Spud, we’re not even close to blotto yet. This, this lazy, flippant behavior, you know what this is? This is what we call “why the south lost to the north”. Yeah, okay, okay, get your dirty bug blistered hands off me. Red Sox! Dodgers! Enis? That’s not Enis. Oh boy. -No, Still not Enis! Alright, Alright, Alright, come on, calm down. What can I get you, what do you need? Water. -Get him some water. Get him some water, come on, come on. Here ya go pal. You’re good, you’re fine, you’re fine. You’re okay. The Krauts reoccupied the northern end of Mount Rotundo. They put an SP out there. 2nd Battalion had to pull back. And the Captain caught a goddamned bullet in the shoulder from a burp gun. Shit. -Oh god. This place is gonna get hot. You don’t think it’s hot enough? -No, stop, stop What else do you have for us? There’s- If there’s a counterattack, there’s going to be more artillery. Alright. Do you have any more rations? Nope. Baker Company’s running slim. This is probably gonna be your last meal, so be ready. Alright. Boys. Drop the bottle, get your helmets and rifles and packs on. Fife, go give Lattie the scoop. Hey, thank you. Glad you got that checked out, alright? Thank you Sarge -You’re welcome. Hey, hey. Looks like our guys are coming, finally. Nothing happened. But- but they’re getting ready. Good man. Good man. My-my letter. For-for my beloved Petra. Don't forget it. I got it old man, okay? What’s the letter about? It’s my goodbye to my beloved Petra. But our guys are coming to rescue us. You will live to fight another day, Staff Sergeant. Oh my God, I hope not. Trust me Halbrock, nobody’s coming. They are too far away. There’s no attack. Artur. -There’s something happening. I don’t’ want to die here. I can’t die here. Something is happening, they are coming, they are coming. They are coming. Please. You know that there is a kraut whore Joe. I thought you hated all krauts. [Polish] Piss off. Red Sox. Dodgers. Leo, your turn. Leo! Your watch. Rise and shine. What’d they cut that with- -Huh? What the hell did they cut that shit with? I told you to stop drinking that wine. You got a cigarette? Oh my god, my head. Where’s the java at? We got java? Good man. My- my letter. For my Petra. I swear to God, my balls are being devoured by these little bastards. Here you go. Where’s my gas? You sittin on it? No, I’m not sitting on it. Why? Why are they not here yet? You still don’t understand, Halbrock. You have to realize that nobody is coming. You like to read Karl May, Halbrock. See yourself in the afterlife? Nobody’s coming. You see what you did there Joe? Even they don’t like the idea of a Pollack laying with a kraut. And don’t worry, we won’t tell anyone in the company. Can you shut up already? I’ve just about had it with you. You know them stripes are getting to your head, boy. How about you lay off me for one goddamned minute. Why don’t you look at yourself, Rowe. It’s 0600, you’re drunk as a skunk. You don’t think there’s anything wrong with you? Hey, how about you get off your high horse boy. You ain’t a better man than me. Ha! I sure am. I’m younger than you. I’m already a sergeant. I don’t have to explain myself to some piece of shit private. With no brains, and no skills. You’re just a lazy alcoholic with rotten teeth. That’s all you’re ever going to be, isn’t it. You know what? I’ve probably laid with more women than your virgin ass has ever been around boy. Oh yeah? Uh huh. Yeah. I don’t give a shit, about your fucking rankings. Or your medals. Or whatever horse-shit ladder it is you’re trying to climb here in the Army. What are you laughing at Fife? You think this is funny to you huh? I sure do. -Yeah, you think this is funny? Yeah? I do, and you care. You know what? To hell with both of you. Okay? You know I could do your job better than you ever could- Oh yeah? -Oh yeah? Can you? Yeah. Yeah, I could. If I was the leader of this squad. -Yeah I woulda put them poor sonsabitches down a long time ago. Easy fixin’ this problem. But you. You know what you are? Whats’s that? You know what you remind me of? Whats’s that? You are a deer in the middle of the fuckin’ road. You don’t know which way to go, and you’re gonna get us all killed. What are we doing here? We’re doing our duty as soldiers. That’s why we signed up. Bullshit! That’s what we trained for! -Bullshit! I didn’t fuckin’ sign up for this shit. I got a telegram, I thought it was from the damned revenuers. You know what it was? It was a draft notice, telling me I’m fighting this war whether I want to or not. Same thing happened to you Lattie, ain’t that right? Huh? Wouldn’t you rather be home with your little girl right now? You too, Fife, right? You’d rather be with your squaw right now? Ain’t that right? But you. You trying to impress your ma and pa huh? Watch yourself. You trying to be some fuckin’ hometown hero? You’re the only one who wants to be here, “Sarge”. Look at you. Drunk as a skunk. Madder than a red hen. Turns out you’re just a coward to- Don’t you fucking call me a coward! Take it easy, Rowe! I will fucking end you. Take it easy. I’ll fuckin end you too boy! Sit! Jesus. You’re giving me a headache worse than your upcoming hangover. Hey, Whats that? Camels? American smokes. It ain’t your lucky day boy. -What! Are you serious? Serious!? Where did you get them from huh? Huh?! Who did you kill? Don’t you dare! A prisoner or a corpse? Son of a bitch! -Ah shit. Fuck oh shit. Son of a bitch savage. -No Should be ashamed. No, No, that’s enough. That’s enough of this chicken-shit. Now everyone sit down and forget about the smokes. Sarge! -Hey! You there! -Sit down! You pig, you! -Godddammit You want to shoot? Then shoot! Kill, you ass! Hey, hey, hey! Put your gun down. No. Get out of the way! -No! Let me shoot him! -No one’s shooting him! Then kill us, you pig! You ass! Damnit! Nobody’s shooting anyone! Now sit down! Sit down. Shoot! I’ve had it, with both of you! No one is shooting him. Thank you. Your cigarettes are the only thing you’re good for. “This is the well known alcoholic W1063 message: Hallucinations caused by the stomach kickin the daylights out of your liver. If you must drink, avoid making martinis with hot tomatoes and pumpernickel bread.” Period. That’s um, great advice for us right now, isn’t it? Let Yoomie interpret your dreams. What do you have over there? Letter. Wanna hear it? Yeah. Dear Daddy. School has started. I scored an A in English, but a C in Arithmetic. That’s all right honey. When are you coming home? Granny says the war is about over. I hope she’s right. Momma came by the house the other day for me to meet her new hus- husband. and Granny would not talk to her. Hey, Hey, Lattie, Lattie. Don’t let that bother you, brother. Guy’s a 4f, right? Yup. I ride my bicycle to school even when it rains. The boys laugh at my stringy hair. I hope to see you soon, daddy. From your loving daughter, Claudie-Anne. That’s sweet. Let’s see the uh, let me see the photo. Aw, she’s cute. -Lets see. Got the “piggy tails”. Yup. -Hey, on a real note. I want you to do me a favor, okay? You gotta keep her a kid forever, you hear? Little I can do about that here. What you all got? Sarge? Any letters? Leo? I got something. -What you got? This ought to be good. Oh! Yeah. Who is she? She’s uh. She’s a girl I um, found in New York. “If you want” Go ahead yeah. -We’ll see, yeah. “If you want the frame. I’ll sent it but the man at the post office said not to sent it unless you ask for it”. A frame? Where’s he even gonna hang it, on a wall in this cave? -No Hang it on Rowe’s cock. What do you expect? You know? They’re civvies. They’re civvies. They don’t know anything about this war. Nobody knows anything about this war. You know. Rowe told me that he was a professional bootlegger. No! What was that? He said he was a bootlegger. What is that? It’s like a rabbit running a carrot farm. Hey bootlegger! -Oh my god. Hey boolegger! -He’s out. Sumbitch sleeps like a corpse. -Yeah that’s how I prefer him. Actually. I’d prefer it if y’all would quit with the wine and the women. You see what I have to deal with because of it? I have to put up with this. You can’t say that. -Yes I can. You know, I was thinking, when we get back home- What makes you so sure we’re getting back, rumhead? Really? You’re gonna be the optimist? Someone has to. Sergeant? Jesus. Sumbitch is still alive. Thought he was dead like the rest. That’s why we call em’ the “Übermensch”. Übermensch. Y’all really gonna try getting that to his wife, Leo? Yeah, I don’t know. I’d kinda feel like a jackass if I left it here though. Yup. -Yeah. I shot the kraut. and yet. I feel pity, that he couldn’t make it home. Y’all fellers, looking forward to going home? What do you think? Rowe? What? What you all gonna do when you get back? You know, drinking, screwn’ -Yeah. Ain’t much else worth doing. It’s the same shit you’ve been doing here, you’re just not killing anybody. Yeah, yeah, I’ll be seeing you in hell. You fellers, you fellers ain’t scared? Scared of what? Going home? Why would I be scared of going home? I don’t know. I don’t know Just thinkin’ too much I suppose. You know, Lattie, that’s exactly what your problem is. What’s that Rowe? Always thinking too much. No, I just. I just never thought I’d get used to seeing this. Seeing what. This. That. Am I supposed to just go back in civvies. Talk to people like I used to? “Hey how you doing? Good mornin’ How’s the weather?” Like none of this shit ever happened. And this Kraut bastard. If he makes it outta here, what’s he gonna do when they finally chop off Hitler’s head? You’ve got eyes like a lobster. A what? You have eyes like a lobster. Fuck you talking about? I remember my father, I think I told uh, did I tell you about it? No. -I didnt tell you? Not me Oh Joe. It sounds familar, yes. Yeah my father fought the krauts in the Marne River, France. When I was a little kid he took me out, showed me how to pull in the lobster cages. and he said to me, you know he was from Hancock. “Marty, if you ever go over there, you might get eyes like these lobsters.” Scared the shit out of me. Yeah, I- I know what he’s saying. It’s like the eyes of a drunk man, you know. Kinda like your eyes. -What? More like your eyes. -That’s the pot calling the kettle black. What’s the punch line? -Yes. Okay. No no no no no -That’s the pot calling the kettle black. This is, no, this is the good part. Shut up! Alright. Then he says to me, he said. He stopped, right, he said, and he looked at me and made me face him and he said to me, he said. So there’s two things in life, right? And the first thing, you’re not gonna like hearing this, but it’s important. The first thing is you’re going to feel pain as you grow up. Insurmountable amounts of pain and it’s just gona keep coming and coming and just when it hits its peak. it’s gonna go, and you’re gonna feel good, you know? And then, it’s gonna hit again, and this time, you’re not gonna know your ass from your elbow. You’re gonna panic, you’re gonna hate the world. you-you might you know cry, and that’s okay. And you’re gonna wanna give it all up. You can’t, you gotta keep pushing. And this is going to continue for the rest of your life. What was the second thing he said? The second thing he said was, he said, you’re not gonna believe this, but you can handle it. All of it. Smart man. Enis! Come on, come on, get over here. Get in here. Go, go, go. Good God man, where in the hell have you been? I had some trouble getting those Krauts back under the artillery. Yeah, Clearly. -But I did it. Alright, what have you got for me? This morning, 2nd and 3rd battalions attacked Mount Rotundo from the South and from the East. Driving the Germans back. Alright. -No Medics? Nope. No Doc will come out this far just for some krauts. What? Guess it don’t matter now. That one’s still hanging on? Barley. Was hoping for some medics to take them off our hands. There’s been a change of plans, Sarge. What is it? Listen up, all you dingbats. We are going on the offensive. Right now? We attack? San Pietro, gentlemen. Drop your cocks and grab your socks, they’re sending the whole battalion up. Alright, you heard him. Pack up and gear up, let’s go! Wha-What abou-hey! -Fife! Pack it up and moving out! What about this Kraut? Rowe. Joe. Take the kraut to the front of the cave. Ahh lovely, -Lets Go! Let’s go big man. -Alright You get that side. -Okay. Here we go. Come on . What are you doing with me? What are you doing with me? Okay. Here we go. Come on. Son of a bitch. We’re moving out? That’s right, San Pietro. Yeah, but first, time to finish what we started. Wait. Come on, Pollack. Everybody ready? Yeap. Look Sarge, 2nd battalion is just on the other side. They’re practically waiting for us. Alright. Let’s go. Get a move on. What about the kraut? I’ll take care of him. Go on. I need you to take point. It means pick up your dogs. Here.
