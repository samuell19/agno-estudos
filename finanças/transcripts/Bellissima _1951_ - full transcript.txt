I've got my own problems already, I didn't need her here She's wasting our time. ''Now I'm tired, I no longer teach...'' No, she's far from being crazy She may be tired, but she drank three eggs She doesn't have any manners I'd better lock the meat up We're wasting haIf an hour to let her hear a poem This is ridiculous We'll miss our appointment with the photographer Doesn't she have anything better to do? Wouldn't she rather be at the park, where it's much cooler? lnstead of drinking other people's eggs! I can't stand her This business about the eggs is really bugging me - Madam, listen - Is the coffee ready? It's coming. Would you like it sweet? The child is very good.

I'm going to teach her something new Let's find a quiet spot, let's see Here's perfect Give me your hand, follow me Come here, dear You'll see what I'm going teach you. This is a lovely place Come here. Good girl Pretend that you are in a meadow A nice, large, green and cooI meadow You have come here to pick strawberries - Understand? - Madam! Madam!

In the meanwhile, I'll get ready What a strange person that woman ''Go and pick the strawberries'' She was just joking, darling. She was teaching you how to act Yes, to act... After all, what is acting? If I imagined to be someone else... ...if I pretended to be someone else... ...I'd be acting You're not interested, are you? It's like when you say the nice poem about the butterfly. How does it go? ''I'm a butterfly, haIf white and haIf yellow'' The one where you move your hands like this Say the poem ''I'm a butterfly haIf white and haIf yellow'' What about the hands? Gosh! You see?

Excuse me, are you really sure they have to dance? In the noveI the film is based on, the child dances I've read it. The noveI starts in that way I don't want to insist, but I think you're wrong lt doesn't start in that way, it starts with her saying she has had enough lt starts like that. And the child dances around the table on her birthday No, she telIs him that she's leaving him He wants to kill her, and the daughter, who is so happy because of the party... ...is dancing and fooling around the table, where the cake is - In the book the child dances - Excuse me Anyway, the more they can do, the better Dancing is not necessary - Are you ready, sweetheart? - Wait, I'll fix her hair Madam, keep out of the way Smile to the man, look at the camera Done! - You almost set me on fire - lt was fine You scared her, she probably closed her eyes No, she had her eyes wide open - Are you sure? - Don't worry, madam - That's all I'm interested in - Madam, I'm very busy - I'm the photographer - OK, no need to get upset - It's lsabella's turn - Darling, were your eyes open? - Yes - You tell a lot of lies.

You dance with your head, not your feet My daughter has brains, she was born healthy, my dear lady! This is your opinion. I'm starting to get annoyed We are the teachers. We say if a child is intelligent or not I can say that because I'm her mother My daughter is not dumb Sweetheart Why are you crying, my darling? They're not going to hurt you. You'll become a good dancer Look how good that one over there is See? Don't you want to become like her? You'll become very good too Did you have to make her cry? How rude Let's go home now.

See? It's Montgomery Cliff He's nice, isn't he? Maddalena, forget about cinema Spartaco, you don't understand me Look at those beautifuI places And look where we live When I see these things... Maddalena, it's a fantasy world It's not Look. They're taking the wagon across Unbellevable The horses are in the water Lucky them It's great, isn't it? How beautiful I'm falling asleep - I can't keep my eyes open - Come on, let's go to bed - Listen, with this ticket you can't... - No, I'm first! - I'm in front of her - Madam, stop being so pushy - I'm not pushy - Calm down He's holding my ticket and you still come here and say you are first - Where do I go? - The room next door - What is the matter with you? - So many injustices in this world - She just doesn't shut up - So pushy - Don't you ever get tired? - I'm so tired I can hardly stand up lt doesn't look like it Look, madam. I had my granddaughter's photograph taken... ...but I made her stand up because I think she looks better - Definitely - We only took one, it was so expensive - They told me one is enough - Of course it's enough - Did you want to bring the whole film? - True My child has only got one too The photographer wanted to take it while she was dancing I told him that she'd show what she can do at the audition This is if they choose her for the audition I've heard that they've already made their choice We're all wasting our time here I wouldn't be saying this if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes - What have you seen? - Tell us Well, yesterday I came here because I got the days mixed up... Mixed up! No, she did that on purpose to get here before all of us No, madam, I genuinely made a mistake Basically, they were doing their speciaI auditions Yes, for those who were recommended I've seen it with my own eyes. There was a lady with a child... ...and she didn't ask for the director - She asked for the other one - Who? The fat and ugly one. The one that yelIs into the megaphone all the time The nasty one - Glori! - So what? As soon as he saw her, he said that the girI was very pretty What's wrong with that? My child's pretty too He was saying how pretty she was, but he was looking at the mother - Ah, now I understand - That's how it goes nowadays lt doesn't mean anything. You're just making a big deaI out of it Do they think we are all stupid here? Probably, but I know exactly what that lady is talking about But we'll go and speak to the producer, the director... ...and we'll tell them that this is a disgrace It's clear that there are favourites, while we should all be equal Yes, this isn't fair. We have to do something about it Actually, I think my husband knows someone who works here I'll call him and ask him to put a good word for me with Stella Film My husband is a friend of one of the phone company directors' What have the phone company directors got to do with this? Well, he's an important person, that's all that matters Don't make us laugh. If we want, we can all find someone to pull strings for us We can all find someone important I have a relative who knows a waiter in Cinecitta He knows him very well. He's got such a good job... Excuse me, what are you doing? Federico, I'm in a rush - Good morning - Bath or shower? No, thanks. We just need a trim and set That way, please. Amerigo, a haircut! - Don't we need the receipt? - No, it's OK - Thanks - Can you add colour as well? - Are you joking? - She needs lighter hair Lighten it? If I take her home blonde, all hell will break loose It's just a slight... She only needs a trim and some curls One moment, after this lady it's your turn What? Where are you? They're making us waste time here - If it's only five minutes... - Listen to me - We'll give you a good tip - That's not the point But it's going to take two minutes. Come here, darling, let me show him It's just a trim... ...and a couple of curls over the shoulders Can't you see that I'm busy with this lady? - But she's almost finished - I haven't finished I've paid, I have my rights Do you want to stay here untiI tomorrow? I have another client waiting. You don't have an appointment But it will take you two minutes, do me a favour - Leave her there, I'll serve her later - You're so moody - Do the balloons bother you? - It's OK You're so kind. See how kind this man is, darling? Sit here. Give me the balloons so I'll tie them here - Do they bother you here? - No They'll keep you company. Mum will be right back - Be good. Will we make it back in time? - Yes, I think so If I don't come back, Mrs Spernanzoni will come and pick you up If I can't make it, a blond lady will come on my behalf She's a middle-aged lady. Her name is Tilde Spernanzoni She looks a bit odd. She's her acting teacher - You'll recognize her immediately. OK? - I don't want to stay here! What do you mean? You have to They'll make you so beautiful If you have to stay with her, we can go another day No, it's not possible OK. Remember to lighten her hair to make it a softer shade - You want colour - No, she's not having it coloured Not a reaI dye. Just highlights, naturaI streaks Just lighter streaks? - And a light perm - No, don't ruin her hair Not a perm, just a set. Her hair's too fine and won't stay in place otherwise - She took it from me - I could give you a nice hair-do too Don't even try, no one has managed that - I could manage - You'd waste your time Anyway, how much is it? - 1 ,250 lire - Shall I pay over there? - Let's go - Be good Make sure you just trim her hair, and curI it a little... ...so that when I comb it, it's all fluffy - Be good, darling - Let's go Mum is coming back I don't want to stay here! Hey, you're not alone, the gentleman is here - Be good - Bye I don't want to stay here! Don't start. If you behave, I'll buy you some sweets afterwards Be good and I'll curI your hair nicely Amerigo, you have to set my hair. It's still all wet Michele will take care of you. Just a minute - I don't want Michele - Michele, come here Coming! I want to go home! I want my mum! - Yes, Amerigo? - Trim this child's hair How can l? I'm very busy - Call Guido - OK, I'll call Guido - Hurry up! - I went to get the shampoo - You're always complaining - Come on - I want to see my mum! - Guido, give her a trim I want to see my mum! Just give the child a trim, then maybe she'll pipe down - Amerigo, are you ready? - Coming - Just a simple trim, OK? - Yes - I'll take care of her - Amerigo, hurry up - I'm coming - Just a little trim? - Yes, just a trim - Let's cut it here... And here I had an appointment and now I am late because of a child - That's one done - This is ridiculous - Amerigo - I'm coming And that's the second one. Are you happy? Are you happy, miss? Is that OK? I wonder what you must be thinking of me since I asked you to meet me What can I think? When a beautifuI lady asks to meet me... ...I think well, very well of her If you see it like this, even better I'm not used to long walks anymore Listen, be honest Do you think my daughter can make it? I'm a little discouraged For no reason, you convince yourself that something is very easy to get... ...and then you don't think so anymore You start feellng worried I'm not sure if you know what I mean I wouldn't want to make so many sacrifices... ...and then see someone who's been recommended win You do understand me, don't you? Yes, but it depends on you What do you mean? - A recommendation can help or hinder - No, no. lt helps We're so used to recommendations, both to making and receiving them If they were really worth something, unemployment wouldn't exist In ltaly we rely on recommendations, ''Please, don't forget'' ''I assure you'', ''I promise you''... But we can't remember everyone Who are we supposed to remember and why? - There's only one foolproof method - What is it? Putting the person who needs help... ...in a position to ask for your help, do you know what I mean? - No - Do you already want to leave? No, it's so lovely here I've never been here before Actually, I've been here on a Sunday, but it was too crowded Today it's very pleasant Yes, it's very nice, but it's not a place to come to alone You should come here with someone nice - Am I nice? - Very In that case, do me this favour, please - You're the nicest - Even better I want my daughter to have the best recommendation ever When the audition is over, I'll sleep better Look, it's as if she'd already auditioned, the result is certain But it all depends on you, it's very simple Now I understand. Do you know what we say in Rome? ''Nothing given, nothing received'' - You're not only funny but also clever - Everybody says so - And you're quick-witted - That's right To make a big profit, one must take a big risk 50,000 lire sounds fair to me You must be out of your mind. 50,000 is a lot of money It's not peanuts Nowadays, 50,000 is nothing Maybe to you, but to me it means a lot of sacrifices In our case, it's the bare minimum to achieve our goal I'll manage the 50,000 lire and get you a contract You'll earn, at least, a million which is 20 times the amount you staked Do you think I'll be spending it? The money's not for me but for the favours we need to do in return Who will you do these favours to? To everyone and no one A bunch of flowers to the producer's wife, a bottle of perfume to his lover... ...who is often the wife of the leading actor Things like that happen. It's not that they need it... ...but it helps them to remember a name In this case, your name - Cecconi ''Mrs Cecconi, who sent that gift, is very kind'', and so on The word will spread quickly Have you ever thrown a pebble into a pond? The pebble falIs in just one spot... ...but from that spot waves ripple out untiI they reach the ocean - How shrewd you are - Shrewd? It's a practicaI way of getting through life Listen, do I have to take this risk without any guarantees? What risk would it be otherwise? Do you want a guarantee? I'll give it to you. Your child will have a screen test All right? I'm in It's a deal. Because I do have that sum I even brought my savings book with me, you see? The problem is, I need the money straight away lt doesn't matter Let's hurry. Banks are closed now... ...but a friend of mine will take my book and give me the money And then she'll withdraw the money tomorrow Listen, if it's a problem for you... ...shall we just forget about it? Moreover... ...I wouldn't want to have a business relation with you With you I'd prefer, maybe... ...I don't know... I prefer it this way. It's much better Let's hurry, it's late - Did you bring the money? - Of course. Here it is One, two, three, four, 50,000 - Where's the scooter? - Out here Here it is. Do you like it? You and your beautiful smile You are easing my pain You know that you can't stay away from me I see you, my beloved You and your beautiful smile Tell Iher that there's no one else in my heart Tell her that I love her more than ever before. . . - It's not my fault - Look at the state of that girl Where's her mother? Who's complaining? All I'm saying is, I've had enough! The child has learned enough Do you expect me to thank you after you've ruined her? Of course. I'm used to being thanked and respected I thank you and respect you. My wife has paid you, this is the door. Out! Your wife is the only one who understands art Art, sure! - Come on, I said get out - Watch your language Why are you shouting like this? - Are you mad? What's happening? - lt happens that I've had enough I don't want any strangers in my house I won't leave my daughter with her In my life, I've never been lucky, but I have been respected a lot Who should be interested in your daughter anyway? - Don't exaggerate - No, madam I've been patient but now I've had enough Do you understand me? I've had enough! Will you stop making a scene? - Get out, that's the door - Spartaco, please Let me say something Darling. What happened? Are you asking her? Where were you? You left the child with this wretch - Are you calling me wretch? - Yes, wretch! - I'll report you to the police - Spartaco, don't make such a fuss lt looks shorter because she's got curly hair I'll wet it and straighten it out - Yeah, make her catch bronchitis - I won't make her catch anything Madam, why didn't you keep an eye on her? - Look at the state of her - I'm not paid to look after her I'm an actress Yes, but you also have eyes. Or just because you're an actress... ...if they cut her head off you stand by and watch? This is the door, get out - Excuse me - Who is she? Is Mrs Cecconi here? - That's me - Fracassini the dressmakers Shall I leave it here? Did I get here in time? I have the invoice with me - I must collect the money - Thank you What did they do to you? You have short hair Don't take me for a fool. Pay up what you owe me That's 1 ,260 lire 1 ,000 for yesterday's and today's lessons... ...200 lire for the child's haircut... ...and 60 lire for the tram. Don't forget it Don't get stressed. We'll pay in full. I'll see to it You won't see to anything. You've got to stop this nonsense - Hands off, Spartaco - How much do we owe you? There, 1 ,260. Now, go - I'm 1 0 lire short - We'll give it to you - You can keep it - How generous. Now, go! - Scoundrel! - Out! You did the right thing by cutting her hair short lt will make her feeI cooler, isn't that right? Why don't you just leave? - What's in there? - Don't touch it. It's mine. Don't ruin it - I paid it with my money - It's not true I never asked you for any money Spartaco, I beg you, let's not fight over it No, Spartaco! You only act like this because I'm weaker Can't you see you're scaring the child? It's been a week from hell here. You didn't take care of the house at all - Am I not in charge anymore? - I've had enough of you I've done far too much for you I've done far too much for you! Get out! - Get out! - I'm going to kill you! - Go on, kill me, you lout! - Am I a lout? Concierge! Come down! He's killing Mrs Cecconi! Concierge! - What's going on? - Go inside. They're killing each other - Concierge! - I'm coming, just a minute! - I can't risk breaking a leg - It's the Cecconi's again They're always fighting, damn it! Are you going to stop it or not? Spartaco, today you've really crossed the line Don't cry, darling I'm leaving this house. Let's go Spartaco, what are you doing? If you take the child, you won't see me again Take her away, you think I'm not a good mother anyway He thinks he's the only one who loves her and makes sacrifices I am the one who ruins her. And do you know why? Because I want her to become somebody Yes, that's what I want for my daughter Am I entitled to feeI this way or not? She mustn't become a loser She mustn't depend on anyone or get beaten like me You don't know what sacrifices I made... ...to find the money to pay for these little things I've been running up and down Rome, keeping it a secret from him... ...not to have to touch his money And how does he thank me? By beating me to a pulp. Leave now! Get out! I can't stand the sight of you. You've ruined me. Look at me I'm full of bruises I'm full of bruises, look at me. I'm all swollen Go away. I can't stand the sight of you He ruined me - Maddalena, stop acting - I'm not acting Come on, Spartaco. She's made so many sacrifices She went as far as Piazza Vittoriana for a diabetic. What more do you want? Give her the child. I'll settle up with you later I don't want to see him again This man will be the death of me Give me the child We made it, honey If we didn't do that, we wouldn't have got an audition My dear, do you think I'm working for nothing? Cheer up! You have to sing The children. . . I've even lost my voice, but you'll see how I sing tomorrow My darling My sweetheart FlLMlNG In PROCESS Quiet, please! What's he saying? It's the voice of director Blasetti I'm going to faint Madam She's gone mad Good morning. My daughter is next We're trying to listen here Will you let us listen? - What does she want? - Madam, please If you say so... Come over here a minute. I have to tell you something - I'm going - Good I also have to tell you something else All the gifts, the presents... All taken care of - Did you send the flowers? - To Blasetti's wife, of course Because it's important, you see - What about the perfume? - To the cameraman To the cameraman's wife, actually. Cigarettes to the cameraman Right. And did you send a big bunch of flowers? lnstead of a bunch of normaI flowers, I sent orchids They cost more but are more impressive. You'll see that the gifts work I'm so nervous, I don't care about anything My heart is in my mouth. My hands are shaking - Don't faint like that lady - I won't. She was a fanatic Who is she? With that funny hairstyle That's Mimmetta - Hi - How are you? What a rogue you are Did you get the scooter? Yes, I did. So, how are we inaugurating it?

You come here - What's he telling her? - Blasetti is explaining to her what to do Does she have to eat that cake? They're lighting the candles. She has to blow them out as if it was her birthday - She won't have to eat it? - No She would have been good at that, she loves sweets Why is he picking her up? She's cute - He kissed her! - Calm down He kissed my daughter! Did you see? Well, that's how it is Everything's going to be fine, I'm sure Come to my mother-in-law's restaurant on Sunday And bring along that lady... what's her name? - Mimmetta! - Yes, the one wearing trousers Your fiancee, I mean You should have seen this child, she was phenomenal All the spotlights were on her. I felt as if I was in Piazza Navona And director Blasetti - he overawed me I couldn't even look at him But she was calm and confident - So calm - She's a very calm child While you were so agitated, as if it was your audition - Don't be silly - But you were shaking Maybe a little. After all, my daughter's future is at stake here. Right, honey? Your medicine! I forget everything these days. My head is in a spin You have to take this medicine... ...because soon you have to start working so hard... ...that if you don't get a boost... What is it? Glycerophosphate... - Sodium glycerophosphate - lt will do you so much good - I don't want it! lt tastes nasty! - Come on If you don't take it, I will - See? - You know what's going to happen? The children who don't take this medicine turn into geese Tomorrow morning, you'll wake up doing this... Come on. Take it. lt tastes like water. Quack quack! - I'm taking it - You see?

It's bloody hot here - It's cooler - Don't let me fall - Look what lovely greenery and water - Where? This is nature But we're so used to it. It's no fun at all Then why do you stay indoors all the time? You can walk down here It's shady and cool Shady and cool? This is a refuse dump! - We're hiding like quails - No, no Don't push me down.

Did you want to thank me for the gift I gave you? - What are you talking about? - What's it like? Does it run well? How fast can it go? - I don't understand what... - Oh, you innocent! May I give you a piece of advice? Look after it You need to get a cover for it so it won't get wet Because if you ruin it, you won't find another fooI like me ready to buy it I hope you don't think that l... - No. I wouldn't dream of it - Seriously I don't care how you spent the money. I knew it from the beginning I was interested in getting what I wanted Fix your hair, you look dishevelled - You're fun to be with - I know, everyone says that I'm just too much fun! So, don't be cruel I'm a sweet little angel And I'm also obedient It's so nice in here - nice lunch, sunshine... - All is missing... - A girl, I know. But you didn't bring her - Mimmetta? She's not my girlfriend - Really? We dated for a while and we may get back together, but right now... - Did you leave her? - Me? I never broke up with anyone - What if I told you it was your fault? - Here we go - Where do I come into it? - You do If you want to talk seriously, we'll talk seriously, if you want to joke... - I've seen her twice with you - Right - Is she jealous? - Yes Of me? Find a better one A pretty girI like her. What am I compared to her? - Come on - Well... Do you think a girl can't be jealous of you? I'm not saying that, but... - Has your husband ever told you... - Of course he's told me, many times - Let's hope they win - Lazio? - Rome! Let's not fight - No, Lazio - Woe betide Rome if they lose - OK, then That's better.

Lord, how cunning he is - What a son of a bitch! - Yeah - I got the scooter I wanted - Damn you... - Life is great, isn't it? - Sure. Life is great lt could be great, instead you only live once... ...and life is short and not always good I know that you love your husband... ...and are happy You're happy when you're with him and the child... ...but I also know that today... ...right at this moment... ...we are happy here together Why shouldn't I say so? It's the truth We understood each other perfectly It's nice here. And l... I'd love to hug you Is there anything wrong in saying so? I don't think so For example, if my mother -... ...who's quite old now -... ...had let someone hug her when she was young... ...in the sunshine, on the riverbank like this... ...instead of tormenting herself by thinking... ...what my life would be like as an adult... ...today maybe she'd be less sad She spends her days mending my socks and washing my shirts My mother Everything that she's given up... ...she's turned it into hopes for me Bless her And now, like Mimmetta, she too does nothing but say to me all day... ...''Be a go-getter. Be a go-getter'' I am a go-getter. You know that very well I never pass up any opportunities that come my way I don't live in a dream world But I don't want to have any regrets Am I right, Maddalena? Don't make me end my Sunday... ...counting the ants on the sand Listen, Maddalena Have you ever tried letting yourseIf go? Doing one of those silly things people do just like that... ...once in a while, without thinking much... ...like rich people do when they throw money away That's the best feellng lt spices up our lives It's everything Do you know that in this light your eyes are blue? Or maybe green, like the water They change according to the light Now they're very light and seem to be smiling Come on now, you're talking nonsense Look at this, I'm all dirty now - Why did you stand up? - Because I have to go Do you want to stay and count the ants? Stay, if that pleases you I can send you my mother-in-law, so that she can give you a hand Let's go Aren't you coming? Or do you want to go in the water, to cooI yourseIf down? Let's go. We need to see the screen test. Hurry up, come on Poor dishevelled fellow lt wasn't your lucky day.

''Under the Sun of Rome'' - Yes - What a nice film You were the one who got slapped I've enjoyed it so much. Do you remember her, honey? You loved it too What do you do now? Are you in this film? No, I don't make films any more - I work here. I do editing - So you don't make films anymore Why? I'm not an actress They only hired me once or twice... ...as I was the type they needed I even got my hopes up And I lost my job and my boyfriend All I can say is, either you are a professionaI actor... ...or give up your dreams and stick to a reaI job I'm sorry to tell you this, because you're full of hopes You might be right, but I doubt it So many people ended up badly thinking they'd make it in cinema I convinced myseIf I was so great and so beautiful... ...and yet, I'm stuck here, doing editing Nobody called me, so I'm here Really? Poor you. But I'm sure it's not the same for everyone That would be terrible That would be really terrible lrreparable I risked everything for her I'd be disappointed Don't worry... ...everything will be fine She's so pretty - Did you see the screen test? - Yes, I did - Is she cute? - Yes, very Please, let me see it - How can l? - Let me see it How can l?

My goodness, you make me feeI ill She really can't do this Stop it, guys! I can't work like this Guys, please. Enough! - Who brought her, Glori? - Not me - Maybe him, Annovazzi - Did you bring her? I only directed her here because her mother asked me Now the poem You recite it so well ''Venice, to thee comes at last the last hour ''Martyr illustrious, in thy foe's power ''Bread lacks, the cholera deadlier grows ''From the lagoon bridge the white banner blows'' Did you cry? Why did you start crying? They're amused, see? Perhaps you made them laugh ''Venice, to thee comes at last the last hour...'' What are they laughing at? What are they saying? Not good things Why are they laughing so much? Why are they so amused? She's a dwarf, look Bastard Bastard. I can't take this. I can't take this What's all this? lsa, stop the film and restart it from the beginning - What's so funny? - She's so funny with that fringe She's not a kid, she's a dwarf - she went to schooI with me in 1 925! - Are you saying you're 30 years old? - Good - What do you think? - It's a counter-productive test I see Excuse me, but if I may say my opinion... ...this last screen test is a waste of film I would have realized straight away that the child was going to do that I have already told you... Your name is Annovazzi, isn't it? You were in the Army, right? Stand up Good. By the left. By the left! Quick march. Get out! - Go away, because... - Sorry, Blasetti If you carry on like this, you're out. I won't be able to hire you anymore - You have no chance - At least let me apologize Do I have to lose my job for such a silly thing? - Let me apologize to him - I'll do that for you See, Blasetti, I was right. We wasted time, money and film Time, money, film and health Our health, because we've been looking non stop for two weeks for this girl And now you tell us that we've wasted money. Stop it, Filippo! You've been laughing untiI now. Go and check what's happening over there - No, let me in - You can't come in Leave me alone, keep your hands off - Calm down - I want to talk to the director - What do you want to say to him? - What? What was so funny about this little girl? Where is he? There he is Mr Blasetti, listen... Let me through. Let me through Excuse me, Mr Blasetti... ...but I was hiding up there in the booth I've heard you all laugh. What was so funny? Why does she make you laugh so much? She's like any other child - One of you even called her a dwarf - No, no How rude! You've no respect for other people's feellngs You've no respect for other people's sacrifices I made so many sacrifices to buy her this dress... - Calm down, madam - And the other guy, that Annovazzi... - Where is he? - We've thrown him out Well done. You're a person who understands. You did the right thing - Let me speak - Well done to you How can we tell if someone is hiding in the projection booth?
