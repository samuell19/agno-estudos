Five seconds. Ten seconds. Fifteen seconds. LOVE OF MY LIFE SABAH AHMAD RAMZI DIRECTED BY NIAZI MUSTAPHA Ten minutes. - What's the schedule today? - First, lunch. Then, the horse races. And don't forget, tonight's my birthday. - Here's to a thousand years. - No, 100 would do. I want to die young. Shoushou? Hello, my dear. Listen, don't forget tonight. Yes, my birthday party. Merci. Au revoir, honey. Mister Mamdouh, we must discuss a very urgent matter. Yes, him speaking. - Please hang up and listen. - Yes. Hello, Zizi. Yes, tonight. Yes, you must come. And Mimi too. Mister Mamdouh, please listen. - What, is it a song? - No, a dirge. Hello? Riri? I've missed you so much. You are coming tonight, yes? Great. And I have much to tell you. - Look, you will do exactly as I say. - Yes, but... No buts. Tonight must be the best party ever. - Everyone must drown in champagne. - You're going to drown too. - Are you joking? - Sadly, no. I don't care. Deal with it. I want a singer, and a dancer. - But how, sir? - You're my assistant. Make it happen. - But please listen to me first. - I said later, later, later. - But sir... - Obey my orders. I will obey the orders. But we'll also have to obey the bank's orders. By the way, I want Nadia to sing. - But she charges 500 pounds. - Give her 800. - It will be her. - Dear me. - I am going crazy. - I do not care. Nadia will be the singer. All the songs are about dark-skinned girls. What's wrong with fair-skinned girls? They praise the darkness of the night, and neglect the moonlight. Print it. - Did you like it? - Very much. Bravo. Ahmad, one moment please. I want you to add a scene that ends with a kiss. I don't think a kiss is warranted here, because they've just met. It does not matter. The audience expects a kiss. The audience expects quality, too. You're still new to this business; You don't know what they really want. I think the audience wants a well-told story, even without kisses. Yes, I agree. - He does not want anyone to kiss you. - No, he's after artistic integrity. You've ganged up on me. So be it. - Excuse me. - Goodbye. Let's go. Places. - What's wrong, dad? - What's not? The bank is about to foreclose on Mamdouh bey's villa. In 48 hours, he'll be homeless. - That's serious. Does he know yet? - No. - We must tell him. - Haven't I tried? He won't listen. All he says is "spend spend spend". If he only knew. - It's OK. We'll talk after the party. - The party? He wants a singer and a dancer, to entertain his entourage. - Did he give you money? - Not a penny. What am I to do? - I am completely broke. - What to do then? I spent all I have on liquor and food. We'll borrow some of mom's money. I've borrowed so much already. She might find out. Don't worry. She'll understand. I hope so. Where is she? Don't waste your time. We're not rich enough for him. - But he's so funny. - Your head is funny. He is not marriage material. - Who's talking about marriage? - Don't you love him? No, I just fancy him. Is that right? Well, I fancy you should go peel some potatoes. Fine. Hurry up. What floozy made you steal the livelihood of your own children? Who was it? I'll tell you. Lower your hand. - Please, watch out. Don't hit me. - Speak, or start writing your obituary. Please, you're all I have. - Who are you spending the money on? - I'll tell you. On Mamdouh bey. - Yes. - You spend money on him? You, a petty employee? - He's so much wealthier than you. - No longer. He's broke. - This is utter nonsense. - I have proof. I have the final notice from the bank. Do you think I'm stupid? I caught you red-handed. I got you. Please, mercy. - Watch my head. - I'll bash it in with my hands. - You're on his side? - Calm down. He can explain. Explain? He's robbing us. Mamdouh is like a son to me. - And don't forget we depend on him. - We must help those in need. It's the right thing to do. - Don't you like him, mom? - I do, but I hate his foolishness. It's OK. Don't beat him while he's down. - Is it really that bad? - What can I say? He's lost absolutely everything. - It's because of his foolish behavior. - It's OK, mom. - Be merciful. - Have pity, dear. - What's the money for? - Tonight's his birthday party. This is the last party... - and then, he'll be homeless. - Homeless? Impossible. He can stay with us. Here. Thank you. See how your good side prevailed? - And does he know? - Not yet. We'll confront him after the party. - Enter. - Sir... - You called? - Is everything ready? Yes, sir. - Your ear. - My ear? - Lend me your ear. - Here it is, sir. But how, sir? - Deal with it. - But I've dealt with so much already. Radwan effendi, look into my left eye. I will deal with it. And I'll go mad. - What will you sing? - Which one would you like? - The fair-skinned song. - Because you wrote it? - No, because you sing it. - Do you like dark or fair skinned girls? - Fair. - Because I'm fair-skinned? - Like the moon. - Don't tease me. I only speak the truth. - She's very cute. - I hope it works out for him. - Jamilah. - She's not just pretty. She's ravishing. Who? I'm talking to you. - To me? - Yes, come here. He wants more money. Are you crazy? No more. He better wise up, or I'll make a scene. Please, don't ruin his party. - What is it? - He wants more money. Give it to him, mom. - Let him be happy for one more evening. - Mercy, dear. Fine, for your sake. - Let's see how this all ends. - I shudder at the thought. - Is it done? - It's done. OK. I will stand right here, and you discretely slip it in my pocket. That will be all. Bonsoir, Oum Ahmad. Happy? All is well? - Would you like to dance? - I don't know how. I must teach you. - What is it? - Nothing. Nothing here, either. Same for me. Nothing. You cry on my birthday? We cry from happiness. - Happy birthday. - Yes, indeed. - Are you celebrating or mourning? - We're celebrating. - We're so happy. - So very happy. - Yet you cry? - Tears of joy. Fine. Go ahead and cry. More. You too. - Nadia, please sing something. - Yes, please. Yes, right away. Nadia, our sun; You must sing on my birthday. Of course. All the songs are about dark-skinned girls. What's wrong with fair-skinned girls? They praise the darkness of the night, and neglect the moonlight. Who does not love daisies? Who does not cherish their beauty? Who's ever seen jasmine... and was not enchanted by its loveliness? White is a lovely color... and is prescribed for lovers... because it pleases the heart. After all, after night, comes dawn. The eye's pupil... allows the light through... and the white of the eye... is what makes it so beautiful. Black and white go together... and therefore, lovers... you must love them both. Otherwise, someone tell me, what makes one better than the other? A Bal Masqu√© on Thursday... And on Friday... A plane flight to Damascus. And Saturday... A surprise party at the hotel. There is more. When we come back... endless parties await. What a big effort. Now I must rest. What is this? You look like shock troopers. We must talk. - Ahmad wants to discuss his new novel. - Right now? Please, I am exhausted. I must sleep. You must listen before sleeping. - Will you force me to? - Yes, we will. - Fine, I will not listen. - Please, for my sake. OK. I'll do it for you. This way. - Do I have time for stories? - I'll make it short. A young man inherited a large fortune. He did not consider investing the money, and becoming a business man. He instead squandered it on parties and gambling... - and nonsense, until he lost it all. - And then what? - And then, that was the end. - How silly. - This would never happen. - It would, and even to the best of us. What impudence. - It's the truth. - What nonsense. - Rich people don't go broke like that. - Yes, they do. - Who's that idiot? - It's you. - What? - I said you. Me? - So... - So the bank will take everything. Here's the notice. Me, poor? Broke? No servants? No staff? No planes? No picnics? No parties? Me, poor? Someone help me. I'm fainting. Get him some cologne. God help us. This is the price of foolishness. - Let's take him home. - Good idea. We must take care of him now. What good are roses for? Better get him some radishes. - Roses are good for his mood. - Isn't work good for his mood too? - He hasn't found a job yet. - Your dad found him many jobs. This won't do, I don't like it, it's beneath me. It's driving me crazy. - Please, not so loud. He'll hear you. - You spoil him too much. I'll wake him up and tell him to get a job now. It's 11 o'clock. Wake up already. Enough. This is driving me crazy. What's this? One can't rest in this house. I'm coming. What's this crazy racket? You'll drive me crazy. Yesterday you woke me up at noon. Today, at eleven. What for? Tomorrow it'll be 10, then 9, then 8, then 7, and finally 6. - Why? Will I be a night watchman? - Responsible men rise early. - Shouldn't I find a suitable job first? - You must get used to it. I stay in this place just for your sake. - Why? Has anyone ever bothered you? - No, not at all. - Go buy him some breakfast. - Yes. Madame, please. - What ever happened to etiquette? - Eti-what? Etiquette means distinction. Manners. How can you ask her to go, in the presence of a gentleman? Prepare the bowl, while I put on my comestibles outfit. - Combustible? You'll burn down the house. - I said comestibles. I'm going shopping. I am going to get dressed and go to the market to buy things, madame. - Here's the new tenant. - He looks like a gentleman. - He was rich and now he's poor. - It's in god's hands. See what the gentleman wants. I'm grateful, but I'd rather wait my turn like everyone else. Waiting in a straight line is best. - Don't you wait in line at the movies? - We're just honoring our guest. Serve him please. - I am so grateful for your kindness. - You're welcome. We are all at your service here, sir. Thank you. Attention. Order please. One step back. One step back. Yes, good. Give me 10 good eggs, and some butter. Order. Folks, order please. Single file. - Why? Is this the army? - Are only soldiers orderly? - Everyone must have order. - You're right, sir. - Let's go. - Single file, everyone. Brother, hold him while I get food. - What would you like? - 30 pennies worth... - of Fava beans, and some bread. - I'll get it for you. Thank you. I'll pay you shortly. Here you go, I got you some good stuff. Your son gave me some good stuff, too. Hand me the food. - Why did you get breakfast yourself? - Gentleman's duty. - Listen, I found you a job. - What is it? - An acting job, in Nadia's new movie. - A starring role? - Not quite. - The heroine's brother? - No, not that. - What then? It's a good role. What font size will my name be in? - We'll discuss that later. - As long as it's an honorable role. - Don't worry. It's very honorable. - Let's go. Wait. Me first. This is the honorable role? A beggar? It's a key role in the story. Listen, Ahmad. I have reformed. I am willing to work for a living, like others. But to be a beggar, and ask for money... Never. It's just a role. You must embody the character. I don't want to. Silence. Not a word. Freeze. Enough already. You came to our house... You came to our house, and crossed the doorstep. With a modest greeting, and a mere glance... my heart almost stopped. You came to our house, and made me taste heartache. You flirt with the neighbor's daughter, you heartless man. Have mercy on me. Isn't this the house... the house you once said is dearest to your heart? You used to roam around it, like the moon around the sun. The house where we spent the most beautiful moments of our life. Now the doors and windows are shut; You may not come back. You came to our house, but you've long forgotten it. And I've been trying to forget those days... ever since, my love. Bravo, Nadia. Next scene. The beggar. Mamdouh, you look like a real beggar. No, I do not like a beggar at all. That's true, you don't look the part. Make him dirty. Cover him with scum. - Scum? - Yes, scum. - Put mud on his clothes. - Mud? Why? I cannot accept that. I hope this makes you happy. There. You want a beggar? You got a beggar. You come right here, and don't move. Excellent work with the scum. Listen. You stand here and beg with your hand. These two will pass you by. Get ready. As they're passing, you say: Please spare me a dime. May god keep you safe and sound, sir. What is this? You're the beggar, not me. Idiot. Get ready. - Camera. - Ahmad. Let's try it. - Wait a second, you. - What is it? I want money, not for myself. The director asked me. What is this? What's this nonsense? - You're a beggar. - Never. I'm not. You're forcing me to beg. I want to earn my money. Please, you must play the part. I can't play a beggar. I can only play dukes or emperors. - You play it. - Me? Go away then. Get me someone else. Come here. Why are you upset? - Come. - Wait. Come here. Me first. - What does he want? - I don't know. - Greetings to the big movie star. - How did you find me? I followed your scent. - Come here. - What a nice greeting. - What do you want? - I want to congratulate you... - and get paid my due. - What due? Don't ever come here again. - Fine. Should I come to your home? - I'd call the police. Is that so? Then I'll deliver this photo to your fiance, Ahmad. - Give it to me, you bastard. - Give me 100 pounds. And if I say no? Then I'll find mister Ahmad. Wait. - Here's the money. - Here's the photo. A deal is a deal. Now leave, and never come back. How you've changed. You used to love me... when you were a small time singer. I was a fool. I thought you were a good man. But you turned out to be a lowlife scum. Me, a descendant of royalty... become a beggar, and sink so low? This time you play a beggar, and next time you'll play a prince. Why not just do the next role? - I haven't written it yet. - You only write for beggars. You've become quite outspoken. - Didn't you take the money? - Yes. I want to relive the past. - I want one parting kiss. - Out, you criminal. Fine, here I go. I'll be back, I can't stand being away from you. - Goodbye, my star. - Out. - Excuse me. - Sure. - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. Nadia, who was that? A pushy fan. He wanted an autograph. - I'm leaving with Mamdouh. - Don't be sad, Mamdouh... - Ahmad will find you a good role. - If Cyrano de Bergerac, I'll accept. - I'll call you. - I'll be waiting. Me first. How much? - 37 pennies. - Here. What's all this? - Are you a banker or a driver? - A driver. - How much do you make? - Depends. Sometimes 5, sometimes 3. - Is this your car? - Yes. - So you only take those you like? - That's right, sir. - Very good. Keep the change please. - Bless you, bey. Hear that? - He called me 'bey'. - Sure, you gave him a whole pound. - What do you mean? - Nothing. - Wait. Me first. - Please. LAWYER Now you know the trade secrets. - You must be courteous to the clients. - Of course, sir. You can count on me. Yes, sir. Him speaking. Really? I'm on my way now. Listen. I'll be away for three days. Check the agenda for upcoming cases... - and ask for their postponement. - Yes, sir. As for new cases... - put them on file for me. - You can count on me. Cases, issues... What a headache. Why don't people just get along? Chakal versus Jaber. Dou'dou' versus Samanlouti. - Listen. - Yes? I'm going to make a list of the plaintiffs' names. Bring them all over. - Yes. - Let's go. Why can't we just get along? Peace, my friends, peace. There's nothing like peace. We're here to reconcile... and drop all these cases. No more hassles. How can I drop the case, when he bashed my head with a bottle? You broke his arm. Come now. Let's all make up. Better than wasting money on cases. You make a lot of sense. I'm going to drop the case. Let bygones be bygones. Me too. - Please forgive me. - My pleasure. Yes, great. Here's the settlement. Sign, and go in peace. I promised the boss I'll relieve him. - But we've already paid. - Don't worry. We'll pay you back. - What honesty. - What virtue. Excuse me. I have more cases to close. Rise and shine. Still asleep? Arise sleepy ones; Wake up, lazy ones. It's 6 o'clock. - What's this? It's only 6. - Tomorrow it'll be 5, and next, 4. Here. - What's all this energy? How nice. - Yes indeed. I am a businessman now, with many responsibilities. - Isn't that so? - A new man. Stay away, evil eye. There, the devil begone. The lawyer must be pleased with you. Very much. He should erect a statue in my honor. - I'll make breakfast. - No. I will make it myself. Is that really him? - I'm going mad. - Me too. Watch and learn how an omelet is made. Please teach me. - Tell me. - Yes? Are you glad? Yes, because you rise early and keep your appointments. - What else? - Well, you're showing me how to cook. - What's so funny? - See what you've done. Oh my. I've made quite a mess. - I guess I was nervous. - Here, let me show you how. - See? - You're quite the housewife. - So, you like my cooking? - Very much, and not only your cooking. - I invite you to dinner tonight. - Where? Right here. We're having a celebration. I know. Your birthday. I was pretending I've forgotten. - I had a surprise for you. - What surprise? My boss is coming back today. And... He'll give me a bonus... Because of my great help. With the money... I'll make you a surprise. You don't have to do that. I am content. I won't be content until I pay you back. You've suffered for me so much. You are... my guardian angel. Hello, sir. Welcome back. - How are things? - Great. Look, all the cases are gone. No more headaches. The clients dropped the cases. They've relinquished their claims. - What have you done? - Isn't this much better? - Better live in peace than quarrel. - Oh god. - What genius. What brilliance. - Thank you, sir. - So you're happy? - So very happy. Don't come in tomorrow. Throw him out. - Give him a rest. - I'm not tired. Can't we discuss this? Peace, he says. Spare a dime? - Here. Now we're equals. - Don't say that, sir. Why not? They wanted me to play you in a movie. I said no. - I don't get it. - Even better. Spare a dime? I need a cigarette. - I just gave you one. - That was for the kids. You have kids too? - Four, sir. - How impressive. - God help you. - God willing. Sir. Please, I'll drive you. - I have no... I have no objection. - A dime, sir. - Give my colleague a dime. - Yes. What modesty. Here. - Thank the gentleman. - May god reward him. Where to, sir? I don't care. Launch. - I feel like launching into the air. - Yes, sir. You sound unhappy, sir. - Unhappy? I'm bursting with joy. - Did someone wrong you? - How did you guess? - Don't worry. All women are like that. - They're trouble. - Why are you badmouthing women? - Aren't they the source of all worries? - No, they're not. - No woman ever worried me. - What is wrong, then? - You really want to know? - Maybe I can help. Stop here. - Have I offended you? - I said: "Stop". "Here". - Follow me, driver. - Yes, sir. Look at my face. - What's wrong with it? - Is it pale? Haggard? - Does it look sickly? - Not at all. You're a picture of health. - So... Am I in working condition? - Certainly. Then, why did I fail? - What's your employment? - None currently. And before that? - Jet set member. - What? - Was that a well paying position? - On the contrary. - It was expensive. - You paid to work? That was the case, until I was broke. Don't worry. You'll get back on your feet in no time. - But how? - Look at me. I was unemployed, until I pawned my wife's jewelry and bought this cab. In one year, I payed all my debts, and now I'm in good shape. All thanks to this cab here. So, you think... - I should be a driver? - And why not? It's an honorable job, and you'll be your own boss. No pesky superiors or managers. Your fate is in your own hands. Enough talk. - To the pawn shop. - Yes, sir. Enough already. You'll sprain your neck. - But he's so late. - Don't worry. He must be on his way. Go take care of Nadia. She's so classy. See the lovely watch she got me? - It's all thanks to this great love. - May they be happy. - May you be happy too. Hurry. - Yes. - I'm afraid. - What from? I don't know. - I feel someone will drive us apart. - What's wrong, dear? You know I love you. Nothing can drive us apart. I hope so. Listen... As soon as I am financially able, I'll marry you. I am counting the days. Soon, I will visit Damascus... for a film festival. - Once I come back, we'll get engaged. - Will you be away for long? - Two or three weeks. - That's too long. - We can't be apart for so long. - Why don't you come with me? - I wish I could. - Take two weeks off... - and let's leave together. - Yes. How will your fans fare without you? They will just have to wait. My love. Please... - May we see you a bride. - Same to you. Nadia will marry me. Whom are you going to marry? - She will marry whomever she likes. - I know who it is. - Who is it? - Should I say? Don't embarrass her. We're more than siblings. We're close friends. Maybe she doesn't want me to know. - Is that true? - Please stay quiet... or I'll tell dad. - Welcome, our house is glowing tonight. - Hello, uncle. Yes, call me 'uncle'. Give uncle a kiss. How nice, Another kiss for uncle. Another one, for the road. - Dad. - What is it? Isn't it enough? I'm her uncle. I must show affection. Come here, uncle. - Are you jealous? - From this lovely girl? Mamdouh is here. - Why are you so late? - I was buying presents. Welcome, art. Welcome, beauty. If I knew you were here, I'd brought you a gift. - This gathering is my gift. - Thank you. Jamilah, an elegant pair of shoes... for your nimble feet. You're so charming. Come, I'll show you. A classy tie, for Fridays and Sundays. I am very thankful. - A pen... that writes novels unassisted. - Thank you. The lawyer must have given you quite a raise. He gave me a licking. A licking? Why? Because I helped him. Because I convinced his clients to drop their cases. My reward was to get fired. He shouldn't have. Where did you get all this from? I pawned my ring for 350 pounds. How could you? It's the family ring. It was unused capital. I decided to release these funds into the market to revive the economy. Great. What will you use the money for? It's done. I already have. - I brought you an amazing gift. - Where is it? It's too heavy to carry. It's downstairs. Come see. - Where is the gift? - Right here. It's right there, waiting. - It's a cab. - Correct. Why did you buy it? I bought it to drive it. - You'll be a driver? - Gentleman by night, and driver by day. Good for you. You're a man now. A businessman. - So... You approve. - Yes, very much. Really? Starting tomorrow... it's all work and toil. Why did you park it there? - Should I call it over? - Call it? Of course, and it will obey. But there's no driver. I've trained it well. You watch. - Are you pulling my leg? - Not at all. Wait. - It's true. - Of course it is. Congratulations. Finally, you act responsibly. You've come off your perch. Take us on a ride. Please, wait a minute. Wait for what? Open sesame. Come in. Come. Launch... into the clear air. Watch out. What's this? It's Nadia's purse. She must have dropped it. One minute please. Ladies first. Please. Wait. Thank you. - Where are we spending the summer? - No need for that. - The kids have tutoring. We must stay. - What's this nonsense? You want me to suffocate? - I won't stand for it. - We'll do it next year. - You know we have debts. - I don't care. - What would the neighbors say? - How is it their business? They've all gone summering, and I'm stuck in this inferno. Better save money... and let the kids focus on their studies. Enough excuses. Listen. We're summering, or else. Be a man, and discipline her. - No wonder you're thin and she's fat. - What's in it for you? Common decency. You husband is looking out for your children, and you complain... - although you look very healthy to me. - None of your business. I am defending a helpless man. Allow me to say, that your kind of woman... is the cause of broken homes and wrecked families. - Shut up, you animal. - Animal? Fine. I'll show you. I'm going to Alexandria. What's this? Don't I have the right? - Down, Mrs heavy cream. - Aren't going to say anything? - Are you leading him on? We'll see. - What's this? Let go. Oh no. Help. Down, elephant. Don't pay him. Not a penny. I don't want your money, tyrant. Go, poor fellow. Come here. I'll show you. You don't protect me? - Are you free? - Yes. Come in. - Garden City. - Yes. Please, sir. - How much? - 30 pennies, and no tip please. - What's this? - Germ prevention. - Fools' alley. - Wait a second. Fools? I don't visit fools. Why take a cab anyway? - Do you have children? - Five of them. Here. Buy them a watermelon. May god bless you. Fools' alley. Are you free? Yes, but I do not drive nudists. - You. - Nudist? Me, nude? I have pajamas on. Pajamas are strictly for bedrooms... not for streets. Go put on your clothes first. Are you free? Yes, but first, stop eating, and drop those seeds. And take the lettuce from your daughter. - Give it to her later. - Are you driving us or bossing us? I'm keeping my seeds, and she's keeping her lettuce. Then ride a wagon, not a taxi. A wagon? You're insolent. I don't chew on seeds... nor nibble on lettuce... nor dump garbage on the ground. Drivers these days. Let's walk instead of this nonsense. Ten... Twenty... and fifty makes seventy. You must try to make more money. More money? I work all day long. I only drive those I like. That's why you're barely covering your gas expenses. - What to do then? - You must drive more people. - You'll earn more. - So I should drive rabble? Certainly, to make money. What do you think of this? I think it's reasonable. You'll be able to get your ring back. And what else? If you make a profit, soon enough you'll buy a fleet of taxis. - And what else? - You'll marry and start a family, OK? Very smart. - Are you mocking me? - No, speaking my mind. By the way... Did Nadia get her purse back? - Purse? - Yes, she lost it the other night. Is there a reward for returning it? - Did you find it? - Yes, in the cab. Why did she did not mention it to me? Maybe she didn't want to upset you. - Hand it over, and I'll give it to her. - No way. I'll deliver it myself; Maybe I'll get invited to her concert. - You're invited. Give it to me. - Is that so? Fine, after dinner, I'll personally drive you there. Oh mother... Mother, there is a young man in our neighborhood... When I water the roses, he asks them for a drop... He wants to speak to me, but he's bashful. He knows not what to say... Poor man, if he could only tell me what he wants... If tomorrow, he asks me for a rose... I'll tell him I can't part with any of them... Go, and may god be with you... I do not want to be scorched by the fires of your love. He laughs and calls out for me, and I tell him to leave me be. If he asks me for a drink, I'll tell him we're out of water. - Telephone, mam. - Who is it? He did not say. You? - I told you not to call me. - Listen. I'll make it short. You're late. You be here in 15 minutes... or I'll pay a visit to your sweetheart. Maybe he can hang our pictures in your future home. You criminal bastard. I'm on my way. I'm leaving. If Ahmad asks, tell him I was feeling ill and went home. Where's miss Nadia? - She was not feeling well. She's home. - Is that so? - Would you like to leave a message? - Yes, I found her purse. - Great. - Here you go. Was that you on the phone with Nadia? No. Why? Then whom did she rush to meet like that? Meet me at your place... after you finish your number. - I'll deliver the purse myself. - Yes, sir. Once you were my fiance, and I thought you were a good person... but when I saw your true self... I regretted ever being with a thug like you. Here's 200 pounds. Give me the photos. If there are more photos... I hope you rot in hell. Shame on you, heartless lady. Have you forgotten the times we shared? Give me the photos and leave. Here they are... and know I still love you. You are not easy to forget. I am only doing this to try to win you back. So sorry to interrupt this. Here's your purse. It was in the taxi. - But you don't understand... - On the contrary. I understand well. Tell him the truth, please. The truth... As you see... You lowly criminal. At your service. Get out. At your service, and the photo negatives are at your service too. Out. Impossible. I can't believe she would do it. I do. She's a wily one, she can't be trusted. - My poor son... - And I thought she was an angel... - and she turns out to be a demon? - I still don't believe any of it. I feel we're being unfair. Unfair? He caught her red-handed, and saw the photos. Please, I don't want to hear about her. Fine, but I don't want you to suffer. I won't lose time on an unfaithful person like her. I am certain that Nadia is innocent. - Wait for the lady. - Of course. No doubt, a very heavy load. Next time, hire a tank. Pick-Me-Up Vitamins Poor thing, you need vitamins. Another one. One more. Sure feels good... to earn an honest living. To the train station. - Sure. - Son, daughter, come. Follow me. Here you go. Today's earnings, from morning... - till noon. - What's this? - Only 6 pounds? - What did you expect? - Do you know how much that makes? - How much? - 450 pounds. - Very good. Hand me 350. - Why? Do you want to buy another taxi? - No. First, I'll get the family ring back. And second? Second... I'll give it to Fathiyah. Shouldn't you ask her first? I know she'll say yes. She loves me, and wants to marry me. Isn't that so, honey? She ran away, which means she agrees. We agree as well. What's this? - They got engaged. - Congratulations. - Hopefully, you and Nadia... - Please, don't mention her. I tell you, she's innocent. Innocent or not... - I am done with her. - Don't get upset. - I'm sorry. - When do you leave for Damascus? - Tomorrow. - Hurry back. I need to get married. You've been ignoring me for months. Let me explain. I saw all I need to know. What you saw happened when I was a young, ignorant girl. I was engaged to that bastard... and we used to go out together. But when I realized he was a hood... I broke it off, and never saw him again. You're the only one. You're the love of my life. And you deceive the love of your life? I didn't deceive you. That was in the past... I did not know the bastard would return. I just can't forgive you. - Don't worry. We'll fix this. - I am innocent. Don't cry. Come with me. And that's the whole story. Believe me. I want to believe you. And I want Ahmad to believe you too. And what's his name? Midhat. I want you to point him out to me. - I want to know who he is. - Stay away from him. He's dangerous. He might be dangerous, but I'm Sherlock Holmes. With my skill, I will expose all his secrets. Tell me, where can find him? At the club, with the latest victim: The dancer, Dounya. - Taxi. - Right away. Looks like a fool. Get in. No more nonsense, please. Didn't I tell you I don't love Nadia, and I only have eyes for you? - Is that true? - Of course. Nadia is just our cash cow. With these photos... she'll serve us very well. Got it? - Yes, I do. - Good girl. - What is it? - Where to, please? Zeinab avenue. Zeinab avenue... OK. Out. Congratulations. You're innocent. I know that there's nothing between you and that criminal bum, Midhat. - I wish Ahmad believes... - He will, I promise. As for Midhat... That wandering mule, I'll teach him a lesson... he'll never forget. Thank you, Mamdouh. - You're a friend. Don't abandon me. - Never. Now, I, Sherlock Holmes... will spy on him, until I find the negatives... and strip them off him... and prove your innocence. I am your brother, your friend, your driver... your own secret service. I beg your pardon. Honey, I've missed you. Honey? Help, your fiance is drunk. Madame, I am not drunk. - I haven't gotten used to the glasses. - Glasses? - Is anything wrong with your eyes? - My eyes are fine. Occupational hazard. Occupational hazard? Did you sell the taxi? No. This is a second job. I have put my sharp intellect and skills in the service of humanity. - What's this job? - Please. I can only divulge it to men. - How come? - That's how it is. - Mrs Jamilah. - Yes? Where is your husband? In his room, resting after a day's toil. Onward to his room. Watch out for the sidewalk. Don't you worry. This cab is a tank. What's this? Watch out. - You ruined the tools of the job. - What tools, mister Holmes? Your glasses almost killed us. I am so sorry. Still getting used to them. - Anyway, where's that pretty girl? - This way. - Is she here? - None of your business. - Don't interfere with the master. - Fine. Come in. Please, mister Gandoufli. - Who's Gandoufli? - Stay sharp. Mister Gandoufli... - Gandoufli, me? - Not only Gandoufli... You're the infamous millionaire Gandoufli, of the silver mustache. Silver mustache? Where is it? - It's a figure of speech. - I don't get it. You don't have to. Just come along. I don't get it either. - You insist on understanding? - Yes. - Rookies... - So we're rookies. Please explain. From now on... - you're silver mustache Gandoufli. - Can we drop the mustache business? Listen. You're a millionaire, you sprinkle money like it's glitter. - I wish it were true. - Listen. You love Nadia. You're crazy about her. - You burn for her. - I like that. - And you just pretend you love him. - Why pretend? Why not for real? - That's essential. - And then what? You convince him that you love him... - You trick him to take his money. - Money? What money? - I'm broke. - I told you you're a great millionaire. Fine, but Nadia, trick me? No one's ever tricked me, expect my wife. - Besides, I have no money. - Money? Here you go. Here's some money. All you have to do now is to love Nadia with all your heart. - With all my heart, forever. Come. - I don't get it. We don't have to. - Can you please explain? - It's crystal clear. The butcher Midhat is blackmailing you... - Why does he blackmail you? - For money. And when he finds out you're with a millionaire, then what? He'll be after me even more. Exactly. Hurry, now. Let's go out. You play the floozy... and he plays the big idiot. Let's go. A genius plan. How about we sit there? Please. Oui, Mon bey? Half a liter of champagne, please. - Hurry. - Right away. Look at the money. - Haven't you seen money before? - He looks like a big fish. Can't you snatch him? I can't. She's got a tight grip on him. - May I have an autograph? - Too late. I've lost Ahmad. What are you blackmailing me for? - That new silly millionaire. - I don't care one bit about him. Well... - Marry me, and we'll play him. - Listen, pal... - No more games. Let's negotiate. - Sounds good. How about 1000 pounds for everything you have? - A little more. - 1200. I'll take 1500. Deal. - How will you get it? - The stupid millionaire. How will he cough it up? Do you recall what you made me do once? Wasn't that why you dumped me? We'll play the same trick on this new idiot. It's a deal. We'll pretend we're brother and sister, like old times. Fine. He's stopping by tomorrow. Your place? I'm not stupid. It must be my place. The idiot must come to my place. - Any objection? - No. It's all the same. Tomorrow at 17:00 at your place. - Sounds good, sweetheart. - Bye. - Don't forget about tomorrow. - I won't. I memorized the address. - Building number 7. - Yes, well done. - Have a nice night. - And you have a spectacular night. I got you. I knew it. Come here, you. Aren't you ashamed, giving rendezvous at your age? - She's like my daughter. - I'll show you. Perfect. Everything is going according to plan. - Where's the idiot? - I don't know. - Is he not coming? - I'm sure he is. Here he is. Quick, hide. You made me ring the doorbell. - Hello, my love. - Love? You ruined me. Quiet. - The checkbook? - In my pocket. - What are those bruises? - I got hit by a truck with no breaks. Tell me, my love. - What will you bring me from Europe? - Europe? Me? Oh yes. Not only from Europe. - What else? - Europe, America, Australia, India... - My love... Kiss me. - But, I... - I'm bashful. - Kiss me. You criminal. Brother. - How dare you? I'll kill you both. - Please. - The family honor... - Please, let's talk... Please, not the gun. Spare me. - And did you spare my sister, bastard? - No, you misunderstand. - 1000 pounds should take care of it. - 1500, you criminal. - We're a conservative family. - Please, just drop the gun. - Fine, where's the money? - Write him a check. Let's go. - Do it. - Don't point it at me. - I can't write like that. - Do it. Where is he? Cat ate your tongue? Isn't this building number 7? My good-for-nothing husband, snatched by this singer. - Come. - Come where? - Good. - The check. The letters first. Just for you. You are my sister, after all. Here's the check. Now, I'll leave you love birds alone. - Congrats, sir. - For what? - Your engagement. See, we're very... - conservative. - I got it. - Good for you. - What's this? - A ballistic missile. And you, floozy... - first my son, now my husband? - I can explain it. Explain, you crook? Please, Mrs Gandoufli... Gandoufli? Radwan, are you pretending you're a rich man, you animal? Please, give me a chance to explain. - His name is Radwan? - Yes. Why is this check signed 'Gandoufli'? - Check? My husband wrote you a check? - Husband? So Nadia, you were fooling me? Help. Police. At justice's disposal. Revolver down, you bum. Welcome, come in. - Hand them back. - You'll have to kill me first. Open the door. Break it. - Where did he go? - The earth swallowed him. Get out. I'm sorry, I can't. I'm indisposed. Are you coming out? No. I'm comfortable here, thank you. I'd rather wait for the police. Put me down, please. - Why? - I want to escape. - Of course. - Thank you. Quick, search him. Search everything. You barbarians, you will pay for this. - When I get out... - You're getting out on a stretcher. - Where is it? - I swallowed it. OK, we'll get it out. I'll kill you. You're mad. - I said I'll kill you. - Go right ahead. - But I can't. - I can, though. May I kill you? You killed him. We'll get the chair because of you, you crow. Please, spare my feelings. Damn your feelings. - We won't get to enjoy our youth. - You can still enjoy your youth. - How nice of you. - I won't call the police. - We're grateful. - Merci. I can hide the body... - on one condition. - What is it? The murderer must hand me the package. - Give it to him. - Impossible. Then you'll hang. Why? I know the law. It was in self-defense. In defense of honor, and love. - What love, you idiot? - I beg you. - When men speak, women keep quiet. - I'll speak then. - Give him the photos and letters. - I said men may speak. - And are you a man? - Of course. - I'll take you for ride. - Ride? - What ride? - We'll take a stroll. - Where exactly? - In my hideout. - Take your hand off me. - Let's go. Let go. - Please spare me, I'm a woman. - Me too. - Take him. - Yes. Get up. Did you get used to it or what? They sure fell for it. - We'll put you in their room. - Sure, boss. What's this? Welcome. Please, come in. Sorry it's such a mess. I would rather die. Why don't you die then, and let us rest? Why don't you give them what they want? Where is it? - I can't tell. - You can tell me. Under my shirt. The dead. - Why is he here? - Get used to him, before you join him. - When will we join him? - After the police leaves. The police heard the gunshot; We're hiding the corpse here. What if the police finds it here? Then you'll all be caught red-handed. - Give him the package, please. - I won't budge. I will only hand it to Ahmad... so that he knows you're innocent... and then, I would have done a favor to two lovers... and to the family I'm so grateful to. Please, enough of your favors. Don't be a coward. Be brave, like me. Don't be frightened. I'll protect you. - Stop tickling me. - Me? - It wasn't me. - Then, who was it? Don't worry, as long I'm here... Tell me. Do you have a cigarette? I need to smoke to calm down. Stay away from me, dead one. I forbid you... You still don't want to hand them over? I'll give them everything. Here you go, dead one. Get them out. Please let us out. - Didn't you get what you wanted? - Almost. What else? I want you to take care of the corpse. - Do you want to ruin us? - On the contrary, not at all. - Gold bless you. - God protect you. - I need 1000 pounds for the corpse. - God damn you. Where would we get 1000 pounds from? - Nadia has a lot of dough. - You took it all, you crook. - Fine. In you go with the corpse. - No, please, I beg you. - How much do you have? - 200. Fine, that will do. Please let us go, I'm in a hurry. The money. - The money's home. We'll wire it later. - You're a funny guy. - Then what to do? - I'll go get it. You stay put, wise guy. You want to get the money, or run away? Miss Jamilah and her husband are staying back. What good are they for me? They're not worth a nickle. - How rude. - What do you want, then? Come here, you. Who's home? - My daughter. - Write. Dear daughter... Please give the bearer of this letter... Write. Please give the bearer of this letter... 200 pounds. - I said pounds. - What else? Pennies? And if there's extra money.... Where's the money? - In the drawer. - In the drawer... please hand it over as well. An emergency has come up... and I must pay. Write. Sign. Address? - Five what? - Ten. - Street? - Mounira street. Get Gaballah. God help me. Don't worry, I'm here. - You see, he's got 7 lives. - You mean, he did not die? As you can see. Gaballah... - Go there and fetch the money. - Yes. You know... You know you're a genius? - You exaggerate. - Not at all. You got me. Whoever tames my intellect is a genius. - Let's shake hands. - OK. Let's drink. - Whiskey? - Of course. - He ruins us, and you drink with him? - Why not? I admire his genius. I want to toast his intellect, and so should you. - What are you saying? - I have a plan... a great plan. Here's to friendship and peace. - But I don't drink. - We must all drink. Here's to genius. Good man. Nadia, drink. Radwan. Drink. Jamilah, drink. - I've drank poison because of you. - Shut up and drink. - Fine, I'll drink. - Fast. Drink. One more drink to genius... - that never gets drunk. - Sure. Never gets drunk... - Please, let me him rest. - Take him inside. - Drink. - Yes. Launch. 150... 160... 170... Give it to me. Give it back. Good. The money. Brother... - What is this? - Just in time. I was going to kill him. Your father and mother and Nadia are captives. - Captives? - Yes, captives of the thug Midhat. I got away, thanks to my rare sharp intellect. - What took them there? - It was me. - You? - Yes, to prove that Nadia's innocent. - Innocent? - Yes. - How? - I'll explain everything. Come. - I'm coming too. - No. This is a job for men. You take the money, and go cook something. I, Radwan the magnificent... What's this? What wonderful luck... I can hardly cope with one of you... and now there are two of you. - Once more, for old times sake? - Stay away from me. I'll show you. I can see you. You'll pay. Jamilah, help. You watch out now. Now what? Gaballah? What? Mamdouh escaped? Ahmad's back? The police? We must leave now. You use the window, and I'll wait for the police. Get him. Break it. Farewell... Hit him, I got him. Here's to friendship. Here's to nutcases. Come here, you. The photos. - We're not thieves. - We're just very happy. It's OK, officer... They're with me. - Let them go. - One minute please. Don't forget the mastermind, the criminal viper... Here's to the police. Now I understand. I am so sorry for everything. Please forgive me. You know you're the love of my life. You're the love of my life. And you too, are the love of my life. THE END Subtitles by Kanafani
