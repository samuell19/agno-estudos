Who and what is a lesbian? Is lesbianism a disease, or a natural occurrence? Is lesbianism reserved for only a few people, or is it a common happening? How do lesbians live? Are they happy with their lives? And how does society accept them? These are only a few of the questions that are asked by professionals trained to study this complex problem. We will make no attempt to answer any question. Only to discuss them. Female homosexuality had its origins dating back in time to the ancient Greeks. Sappho, a famous poetess of Greece, is alleged to have founded the love cult of lesbianism. Which derives its name from the island of Lesbos, of which she was a native. According to history, Sappho was known to have been a woman lover. Sappho was a brilliant poet. And her poems became world famous. The girls with whom she fell in love were named after her and called Sapphols. They became the first disciples of her love cult. Many of Sappho's poems were written for girls. She would, in some of her poems ask the goddess Aphrodite to help the poet in her relation with a beloved girl. In one of her poems, "The Dye," Sappho writes: "From Scythian wood" "they brew the dye whose yellow hue" "turns gold the lovely hair of Lesbians fair." In another, "Love's Banquet," she says: "Grant me this, O Kypris" "and ever grateful" "I will bring thee many gifts for thy altar." "Doves, a tender kid" "and the drip of rarest Lesbian vintage." Medical reports and several well-known, authoritative books on the subject of lesbianism tell us that there are types of lesbians. The masculine stereotype known as the butch or dyke. Many variations. The bull dyke, the stomping butch, and the baby butch. The baby butch is usually the confused teenager who's not sure of what she is. Science tells us that for every type of creature who walks the earth there is a counterpart. And so it is also true with the butch. In this case, the feminine counterpart is known as the femme, or doll. Regardless of whether butch or femme, the majority of lesbians, though they might slightly modify their dress or hairdo, are indistinguishable from the majority of women with whom one would naturally associate. Lesbians, like their male counterparts, the homosexuals, are found in many professions, and master many skills. They're found in the publishing, modeling, and theatrical fields. And they're also found in many arts and science fields. Again, they're also found to be truck drivers, teachers, cabbies, nurses, engineers, clerks and secretaries, representing an impressive cross-section of life. Lesbians are usually overly discreet in their methods of finding or courting others with the same desires. However, like everything else there are the exception. Wherever girls and young women are to be found in any number, it is quite possible that lesbians can be found. The modeling business is one of these places. Many of the girls who are models are not necessarily lesbians. In some cases, it's the photographer who's the lesbian. The dyke will try to get as close to her girls as possible without arousing suspicion. She does this until a model comes along who will respond to her advances. Quite often, the boundaries of female homosexuality are so vague, that women slip into lesbianism without realizing that they're lesbians. It has often been said that lesbians make strange bedfellows. Cultured, sensitive, refined women fearful of exposure among their own patronized dingy, dirty, off the beaten path bars and clubs, in search of a love that could satisfy their never ending yearnings. It is not uncommon for a well-known personality to pay pickups for the pleasure of their companionship for the evening. Lesbians have a problem in adjusting to a society that is condemning them for being lesbians. Many teenage lesbians are prostitutes and drug addicts. There are countless number of mature women who seem to have found happiness in the love of another women. Many lesbians have their own special vocabulary. The phrase "coming out," indicates a lesbian's sexual debut. "Being gay" denotes female as well as male homosexuality. A straight is a heterosexual. And a swinger, an object of admiration. The following statistics were compiled from medical reports. Society has a very great problem in its understanding of the desires and needs if its unmarried women. Doctor Freud stated, "Homosexuality in women," "which is certainly not less common than in men," "although much less glaring," "has not only been ignored by the law," "but also by society." Lesbians are not nearly as promiscuous as male homosexuals. Their meetings with others is held in the strictest confidence. The lesbian is on the constant lookout for a partner with whom she can live and love in a so-called normal life. Few lesbians find anything that resembles this life. Some couples have stayed together for as long as four and five months. It has been said that some have lived together for as long as ten years. Many, of course, last but a few days or weeks. And some dykes pride themselves on immediate conquests. Drived out of one-night stands, as this dyke is about to do. There are a multiple number of factors responsible for the development of lesbian patterns in women. Family discord, alcoholic fathers, separations and divorces, neurotic and psychopathic parents, sexually maladjusted parents, to mention a few. Psychiatric examinations have shown that lesbians have fathers who were psychopathic, alcoholic or tyrannical. Many fathers have often made the mistake of telling their daughters that they wish they'd been born a boy instead of a girl. In other cases, a growing daughter's attitude towards members of the opposite sex may be influenced by the character of the father. Especially if he proves to be a poor example of what they think a father should be like. Especially if he proves to be a poor example of what they think a father should be like. Some mothers are also responsible for the influence they cast over their daughters. Some mothers instill a fear of sex within the daughter. They refer to sex as something evil. Of course, there are many cases where the daughter is further handicapped if the parents neglect to give her any sex education at all. Being misinformed about the facts of sex is equally harmful. There are many occupations that are conducive to the development of lesbianism. This, however, is not meant to imply that most women engaged in a certain profession are lesbians. Lesbians, in many cases, choose an occupation which brings them into closer contact with members of their own sex. Such as the theater, nightclub work, modeling, women's prison, secretaries and so forth. Many young girls of high school and college age find companionship among their own sex, and often share the same rooms on campus. Women are constantly striving to prove that they're equal to men, and also, are fighting to be independent of them. Today, women are found deeply involved in politics, medicine, sports. Today's women are more career-minded, and tend to shy away from the domestic walks. It is not uncommon to find a woman cabdriver, or bus driver. In some countries where there's a shortage of men, women are in the armed services and are doing the fighting and dying for their country. Ads and newspapers, and on television depict the women as inclined to smoking and drinking. This may be considered a form of psychic masculinity. Women are sensitive and highly emotional creatures, and because of this, are easily frustrated. If this frustration is caused by a man, a woman could become more susceptible to lesbian advances. Love and attention are important facets to a woman. When they're deprived of love they are apt to find refuge in the company of one of their own sex. Jealously among lesbians is a common happening. This is in a keeping with their emotional immaturity. Usually, the aggressive lesbian becomes jealous of her feminine passive partner. This jealously is evidence of the lesbian's sense of insecurity. The following are actual statistics compiled from medical reports. In noting that the lesbian is capable of a high degree of jealously, it must also be noted that there is a high rate of suicide among women. And this is directly attributable to their homosexual desires. The suicides are usually the result of the frustrations that are built up within the lesbian for her desire of another woman's love that is not always easily obtainable. We will discuss this problem a little later. Marriages are not uncommon among lesbians. In her route to establish some form of permanent relationship, the lesbian often attempts to simulate heterosexual marriage. Rings are exchanged, they draw mutual wills favoring one another. The wedding is held in an atmosphere resembling a heterosexual service. The services are usually performed by a male, in many cases, a homosexual himself. Guests are invited, dykes and their femmes. The services are usually brief, in which they vow to love, honor and cherish one another until death. The death usually represents the point where one lesbian leaves the other for some other love. The lesbian marriage life is usually a short one, lasting from one night, to a couple of weeks. Some have been known to last for several months, or even several years. But these are the rare exceptions. Aside from purely lesbian marriages, there are cases of marriages between women and homosexuals. There are various agreements which they agree upon before embarking on marriage. In some cases, they decide to offer each other companionship. Agreeing not to attempt relations. Each one retaining the right to do as he or she pleases about their private sex life. Marriages to homosexuals seldom succeed. Where the marriage does survive, it is more the exception than the rule. There are many cases where lesbians marry and stay married. Even when the marriages proves to be unsatisfactory. It is not typical for the lesbian, being the passive member of the marriage, to stay indifferent. Staying at home, she can make friends among other housewives without raising suspicion. Lesbians, the possessors of an abnormal jealousy over their femmes, sometimes get very upset and sometimes get very violent when another dyke makes advances in the wrong direction. The dyke will fight, in some cases to the death, for the affections of her femme. The femme is always flattered over their show of affection, and usually encourages the dykes to fight. Once committed to lesbianism, the lesbian seldom shows the same guilt feelings that the male homosexual shows. The following are statistics compiled from medical journals. Society has a very great problem in its understanding of the desires and needs of its unmarried women. Doctor Freud stated, "Homosexuality in women," "which is certainly not less common than in men," "although much less glaring," "has not only been ignored by the law," "but also by society." In a fashionable part of town, several dykes were getting together for the purpose of planning a party. This one would be a very special party. One that would bring new faces in, and most of all a coming-out party for a new girl. A girl makes her coming-out only once in her life. She will be introduced to the other femmes and will meet the dykes. In most of the cases, the new girl has only had very limited relations with a lesbian, and is looking for a closer association. The new lesbians, as well as the older ones, are always on the lookout to find somebody they could love or love them. This is a struggle that never ends. That homosexual components lie dormant in every women, and could under certain conditions, find release, are substantiated by federal prison records. The number of sex starved women who submit to homosexual relations as a result of their confinement within prison walls, is much greater than is supposed. A fair percentage of all women inmates is made up of those who have been apprehended by the police on charges of prostitution. In other words, prostitutes, who were deprived of their heterosexual relations, because of prison walls, now give way to their hidden desire for homosexual cravings, find themselves literally in a haven that is made up exclusively of members of their own sex. The hostess of the affair was a women in her late twenties, who has been a dyke for the last sixteen years of her life. Even when they think and live like men, lesbians, for the most part, generally enjoy the chic look of womanhood. Because her homosexuality is easily hidden, the lesbian mingles very comfortably within the bounds of society. But, it is at affairs like these that the lesbian can relax and feel her true self. The guests arrive one at a time. The hostess is very efficient. It's all important to have everything running as smoothly as possible for the convenience of the new girls coming in, and for the dykes to be able to move around and select a femme for themselves. Parties of this nature are kept in the strictest secret. Fearing exposure, the lesbian is often at the mercy of everyone. At work, or wherever she may be, she's always susceptible to blackmail. Discovery, in most cases, could mean instant wooling. Lesbians have their variations from one group to another. There are those women who are cultured and refined, who sneak away to some dirty bar in order to meet a trampish looking woman to make love to. Some women break up homes, forsake children for the love of another woman. Then there are the teenage lesbians, or baby butch. They roam big city streets in large gangs assaulting everyone who falls within their path. Some of the weapons that they use run the gamut of fists, lead pipes, chains. Many of these girls eventually end up as alcoholics, drug addicts, and prostitutes. Regardless of what the lesbian does or where she goes, her life is a very difficult one. The lesbian must always be on the alert and avoid detection. She, like her male counterpart, leads a very lonely and despairing life. It is a fact that the suicide rate among male and female homosexuals is very high. A lesbian making her debut within her own society, reacts as any other girl would when she's doing something for the first time. And knowing that she will be in the spotlight and possible the main attraction that evening. The dyke is telling her how to behave in front of the others and how to act like a femme. Initiation rituals might vary from one affair to another. At some affairs, the evening would be spent in drink and general talk. While at some other affairs, it was quite different. The bull dyke enters the affair followed closely behind by the femme, ready to make her initiation into the daughters of Lesbos. Butch and the femme are completely different in appearance, yet many lesbians feel that this dissimilar role were easily interchangeable. The fact remaining is that the butch of today could become the femme of tomorrow. One reverse is often possible. Records show that there have been many butches who have actually become feminine in manner, and some have apparently returned to normal femininity. It is virtually impossible to tell how many lesbians there are in the country. However, lesbian vacation paradises are well-known to the more informed. Fire Island. The California beaches. The tropical islands of Jamaica. On Long Island, they have the Hamptons. And the New York City set have Riis Park. The international set always have Paris, Rome, Switzerland to mention but a few. This gay party was worked out in a manner that would allow the guests to all mingle together, or singly as they chose in an atmosphere of privacy. These girls chose to develop a slow relationship before getting down to the more serious lovemaking that all were here for. This type of play is a form of teasing, a way of stimulating their inner senses. The introduction room, as this place was called, would allow them the privacy that was needed in order for them to play this game. It was at times and places as this that the lesbian was allowed to feel her true self without worry of detection. It was here that she found her love and contentment. The bull dyke was at her best when she was working to make a femme. Not all bull dykes succeeded in their attempts, so the going had to be slow. The ultimate conquest for the dyke would be to have the femme become dependent on her. In this case, the dyke would support his femme. In a more literal sense of the word, the femme would become the mistress of the dyke. The dyke, as records show, are very dominant and possessive, and extremely jealous people. The femme in her desire to break away from the grip of the dyke, often found this an almost impossible task. A strange occurrence happens when a lesbian has to turn to prostitution in order to keep her female lover. The johns that normally pay fifty and a hundred dollars for the privilege of love, would pay an additional fifty dollars to be with a lesbian. The logic being that the men were highly stimulated to think that they were able to draw a response from a woman who was known to be indifferent to men. In prostituting herself to finance her woman lover, the lesbian finds it ironic that it's a man's money that's paying for her pleasure with a woman. Men, unknowingly, sometimes use lesbians as procurers for them. And in many cases, the lesbian usually samples the girls before she turns them over to the man. It is not uncommon for a lesbian to do what she hates most: Prostitute herself to a man. It is also not uncommon for a prostitute to turn in moments of despair and loneliness to the warm, soft arms of another woman. Many lesbians, as a rule, are heavy drinkers. Some are alcoholics. At parties, such as this one, girls are trying to escape from reality, and drinking usually helps. Young dykes will always try to get their femmes high on drinks. They become more responsive with a few drinks in them. These affairs, as a rule, take place on weekends, so as to last for several days. After the party is over, these girls will all go back to their daily jobs, some as clerks, secretaries, hostesses. The lesbian looks upon her job as a means of contact with other girls. Lesbians are always on the lookout for new recruits. After a few drinks, the dyke has been able to get the young deb in a receptive frame of mind. Being a new experience for the deb, she's not sure what will happen to her. Suspense and excitement are usually built up in her. But she dares not say or ask anything, fearing that they might not want or accept her as one of them. So she's willing to wait it out and accept what comes. After some drinking, the girls decide to split up. Each couple going their own way, each dyke planning what she will do with her property, the femme. The kitchen is not an unfamiliar place. It is the femme's duty to take care of the house. Cook and wait on her lover, the dyke. Many lesbians have, at one time or another, been married and, for the love of another woman, forsaken their homes and families. Some lesbians remain married to their male husbands, and when the opportunity presents itself, leave home to go to their female lovers. Though many lesbians marry and have children, others, who never marry, feel a strong, maternal void. There are many sacrifices that a lesbian has to make, and one of them is the fact that she can never bear children. Lesbians, being women, pass through the child-bearing years. And even though she might carry on in lesbionic harmony, she often regrets that there are no children in her life. The dyke is a very selfish person. She's out to get all she can, and as often as she can. The dyke often takes unjust advantage of the young femme. After feeding her drinks all night she becomes very receptive to the dyke's suggestions and advances. There have been cases where the inexperienced femme developed guilt feelings, and was ashamed of what she had done. However, this is not always the usual case. School girls of all ages are not immune to the society of the daughters of Lesbos. Girls on many a college campus live together, share each other's clothing, talk about their dates, discuss many mutual problems, their likes and dislikes. They spend more time together than with anyone else. Often these girls find consolation and sympathy within the warm touches of each other. Some girls, after leaving school, also leave their lesbian loves behind. Others continue in leading a life of a lesbian. The dyke is always the dominant figure among lesbian groups on the school campus. For as the saying goes, "For every dyke who walks the earth," "there is a femme for her." Some girls freely talk about their lesbian habits, while others would rather die before admitting their lesbianism even to their closest friends. Even among lesbians that they can trust, some never reveal openly what they really are. Many lesbians don't want to think of themselves as lesbians. During the course of the evening, the party had reached a peak. The dykes had all assembled in the main conference room. The purpose of the meeting was to reach a decision on what to do with the young deb. Each dyke had her own ideas of what the initiation test should be. But only one suggestion would be used. A vote was being taken on the suggestions. And the straws were being drawn to see who would carry out the initiation as decided. The dyke had sufficiently mellowed the young deb for her ordeal. Still not knowing what she was about to undergo went willingly upstairs with the dyke. A decision finally being reached. And the dyke to carry out the initiation picked. They all left the room ready and eager to assist if necessary. The dyke and the young deb enter the bedroom and the suspense begins for the deb. The dyke is in no hurry. She has all evening and the deb has no place to go. At times like this, every dyke is out for herself. She would like to be the first one to initiate this young girl. It would give the dyke great satisfaction if she could be the first to have her. The young deb realizing now what they've worked out for her begins to show fear. She tries to escape. That doesn't work. Desperately, she fights. But the dykes are too strong for her, and eventually she's overpowered. The bull dyke will now do her work. The dyke never feels remorse or shame for what she has done. To her, it's another conquest. One to be remembered for a short time, and then forgotten. Soon, the party will be over and she will return to the heterosexual world that she so violently rejects. A world that she must constantly be on the guard against. A world and its male inhabitants she must pretend to accept. A world, that if it discovered her true identity, would turn against her and destroy her. The path of a lesbian is truly a hard and lonely one. A few, if any, ever find what they're searching for: True love. Someone that they can love and who will love them. Love that will last in the rest of their natural lives. Not all lesbians are masculine in appearance and personality. Many of them are feminine, married and have children. Their marriage is a coverup for their lesbianism. As long as human beings are interested in their own sexual satisfaction, there were always be inverts. The following are some important statistics in the study of lesbianism. The problems of the male and female homosexual are of a complex nature. There are answers to these problems, and these answers can only be found through competent medical advice. Society, as a whole, is responsible for this ever-increasing social problem. It is therefore, up to us to be understanding and forthright in our desire to help those in need of it. Lesbians can be cured if they show a strong desire to be cured. They cannot cure themselves entirely. Sound medical treatment and advice is necessary to effect a permanent cure. Medical authorities state that lesbianism is a symptom that affects the personality. Treatment is aimed at changing that personality structure.
