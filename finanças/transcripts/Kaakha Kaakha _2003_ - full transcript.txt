Hey, you killed my son. killed my son. l'll show you who l am. Hey, don't blabber. How many people are there in your house now?.. People who've come to offer condolences. All are crying, aren't they? Did anyone think why your daughter isn't around, crying? Where's your daughter Selvi? Where's she? Selvi... Your daughter Selvi is with us only now. My boys are getting lusty seeing her. Seetharaman, bring Rs.30 lakhs and take her back. No police or else another sack will come to you. 30 bundles of Rs.1000 notes. 100 notes is one bundle, brother. lf he had done it earlier, we needn't have killed that boy. He got sense only after we kidnapped his daughter. Simple... but powerful, brother. Beautiful girl, isn't she? Our boys were itching to enjoy that girl. One should never force a girl. They must come to us on their own and lie at our feets. l gave drinks to our boys and asked them to sleep. They all got vexed. They've started thinking, "This man is totally different". Sethu, where ever we go we should rule that city. We must create sensation in that city. Let's show who we are to this city, Brother. Criminal activities flourished. Madras city was caught in a crime wave. In 3 months,Sethu, kidnapped 6 people. 3 extortions... 13 murders... 11 dacoities... How's the vehicle? - Superb brother, flying like a jet. Watch carefully. lt may really fly away. Number is good. At that time department didn't know that there was one Pandia with Sethu. and that he was the brain behind Sethu's plans. This city is ours. From Tambaram to Ennore, everything is ours. Pandia, you've brought good fortune with you. Have it... Have it. We aimed at Sethu. We decided to terminate him. Come, let's go. No problem. l'm telling you brother. You're having high temperature. lf you come in this condition, it'll be death for you. Hey, entire city police is after my life. This fever will not kill me. Come Pandia. - You'll never listen to me. Hey, take out the vehicle. Vasu Seth, it's Sethu. No need to go to Trisoolam station. Chenglepet Railway Station. Come straight inside. You must be there in an hour. You're coming alone, got it? Yes, Anbu... tell me. We've assembled here. ls the information correct? lnformation is correct. They're meeting at Chenglepet station not at Trisoolam station. Vasu Seth has arrived. l think we should take positions. Police! Police... move. Sethu how sad you got caught. Anbu, this is what you wanted right? - Yes. What shall we do now? Like in Vijaykanth's movie, shall we handcuff him and drag him on the streets. No... we'll kill him here. Anbu, we'll kill him here. Sethu, did we send message to pack your shop and leave this place. You didn't listen then, now you're going to die. Or let's put him behind bars. He'll reveal few VlP's names. We'll catch them. There's a large customer support team behind him. Hey, who needs VlP's names. Arul, ask him if he believes in God. lf so, ask him to offer his last prayers. He appears to be God-fearing or else tell him to close his eyes. l don't feel like letting him go alive from here. Sethu... afraid? lf you are afraid, you shouldn't have come from Tuticorin. Sethu the most dreaded gangster who held the city to ransom for 3 years. An anti-social who gave testing times to the department. He's no more now. I felt proud. I didn't feel any remorse killing him. I had only one thought. This city will be peaceful. No need to worry. We'll go away Pandia. - Yes, Pandia. At that time we didn't even know that Pandia existed. Pandia, why has this happened like this? Pandia, say one word We are waiting for your order only. Where will be Vasu Seth now? - We can find him Pandia. Police has got all the information from Vasu only. Sethu, left Vasu freely. He was never afraid of us. He was not under our control. That has done all the damage. Vasu Seth must die. His entire family must meet a ghastly death. We'll do it. Pandia... - Sethu's death must be avenged. lmmediately. All Police Officers in the city should run in fear. lt must be that ruthless Right now. By tomorrow's dawn, let it be anyone in Anbuselvan's house. Wherever they might be, father, mother, brothers, sisters, wife, children... no one must be left alive. For Sethu. lt must happen. l must talk to Anbuselvan While this is happening. l must hear his cries. How will we do it bose? We can do it, Pandia. We can do it. Pandia, he doesn't have anyone you had mentioned now. Anbuselvan is a lone man. We can take on others. They're a team. Anbuselvan, Arul, llamaran, Srikanth. They're always together. We can hit them. No. We can do it, Pandia. We can do it. l've seen. There's a girl. They were talking to each other near Commissioner's office. l had seen them. l'm sure she's his girl. Hi. - Hi. Sorry, l was busy all last week. l knew it from the newspaper Have you become free now? Totally. This is Swathi. - Hi! - Hello. Shrikanth - Hello... - Hello... - Come. Velu, make a call to Pandia. This is my hide out. Usually l never invite anyone home. l like to stay alone. l've to change this rule for you. l'll change... no...l've changed. Why it is so dark? Usually, l never open the curtains or windows. l like darkness. lt's nice now only. l'm not saying that it must be like this. l'm just saying that this way it's nice. Hereafter your life is going to become colorful... see Here... Let's sit here. Vasu! Bastard!... Bloody rascal, you betrayed Sethu, didn't you? You forgot that your life was given to you in alm by Sethu. Vasu Seth, you'll never be forgiven. Your family must die. And you must die watching them die. Hey, Ravi, Kasi... Chop everyone. Our children will easily get admitted in my school. No need to apply in advance. No need to pay donation. You needn't stand in queue. -Then? l'm a qualified Mathematician. ln simple words Maths scholar. No need of tuition in Maths for our kids. You too needn't trouble yourself. Any way you don't know, l know it. l'll take care of it. Maths is very important, isn't it? Then, l'm a good singer. l've learnt classical music. l've learnt to play Guitar. Trust me. Then? l was very fat as a child. Now, l'm like this by dieting & exercise. Slim? - Yes... slim. lf l stop dieting... You'll never need a bed. l'll become like a bed. Where were you all these days? l was here only. You didn't see me. l feel like living with you from today itself. Hello. - Anbu, l'm Arul speaking. Anbu, they entered Vasu's house and massacred everyone. They had knives & daggers and chopped everyone mercilessly. This place is one bloody mess up. l'm speaking from here only. They've killed 5 people. his wife & children. They've left Vasu after beating him. Who? - l think Sethu's boys. We changed Vasu's residence no? They barged into that house and attacked everyone. How could they locate him? l think they've got the information from the department. - No way... Okay... l'll call you back. - Okay. Hello! - Anbuselvan... - Yeah! Who's this? Are you a F-great...? Are you bloody F-Police Officer? Who's this? Tell me your name. Do you know the condition of Vasu Seth? lt'll take 3 months to clean the blood stains from his house walls. The biggest mistake you made in your life was killing Sethu. You shot him dead like a street dog. You must pay the price for his death. Hey, come to the point. Hey, read my lips. You'll fear. You'll cry... You'll feel the pain. Shall we? You'll regret for choosing police job. The girl who's in your house now, isn't she your girl friend? She's beautiful. l'll kidnap her before your eyes. l'll make you go mad. l'll make you go from pillar to post. l'll make you cry. l'll rape her and l'll drop her corpse in front of your house. Watch. The policemen, who were with you while killing Sethu, and this girl, will all be killed by me. lt's a challenge. After that l'll talk to you when you're left alone. l can kill all the officers today also. But, you must know that such an enemy exists. You must fear me. That's why l've called to inform you. ACP, this will happen. lt'll happen, but slowly. lt may happen after 2 or 3 days. Or it may be happen by dawn tomorrow. You just watch. Any problem? - No. Sir! Go outside, act casual and check someone is standing in our street. What is it sir? Selvaraj, check if there is any suspcious movement. - Okay, sir. No movement of people. But there's an auto parked. Auto? - Yes. lt's parked on the street corner. Sir, any problem? A phone call threat. You two stay here. - Yes sir. Be alert. What's happening? - Sorry Maya, somthing's come up. l must go. Okay, l'll go home. You don't need to go home, stay with me, l need to take you somewhere else. Hello! Control room. Anbuselvan speaking. Thilakan, listen carefully. l need 5 of our boys immediately they need to meet me near my house. Tell them to come in an auto... no need of a police vehicle. There's a Kamaraj statue. 2 streets from my house. Tell them to park there and wait for me. Tell them to come armed. l'll inform the Commissioner. Okay. Do you usually go out of your house like this? Sometimes... come on... Careful. Careful. Stay here. Sir. Parthi, l need to go out. - ls that, so sir? Sit in the auto. l'll come in a minute sir. Come, sir. My fiancee... - You're marrying?

The girl? - She's also inside... with him. Security? 2 constables are there... Any other security, police vehicles or men? Nothing. Can we attack him now? - l think we can. Hey bloody bastard, tell me in one word. Shall we attack now or not? We'll attack, Pandia. lf he goes out, follow him and inform me on the phone. l'll be there in 20 minutes. Threats are not uncommon in a policeman's life. But I was sure this was not an empty threat. I don't know who he was. He had already attacked Vasu. Now he was targetting Maya. Through Maya, he was after me. I had a hunch that he would attack my house that night. I prepared for a counter-attack. Hi... - Hi. Come. - Hello. - Hello. Hi... - Hi. - Please come in. Please, come in. Are you leaving now? We'll be back in an hour. - No problem. l've many things to tell her about you... take your time. Anbu, who is he? - l don't know his correct identity. l think he was close to Sethu. l could feel anger in his voice. They know we were in Swathi's office. They were following me all day. His men are watching my house from an auto. l know it. He threatened to kill Maya. Maya, then all of you, and then me. He'll definitely make an attempt today. l need to find out who he is. There are four of us, and l've asked for five more of our boys. lsn't that enough? No problem. - lf he fails to turn up... He'll definitely come. Let's give him a surprise. Boys. Hey, Rafiq... Sorry guys! l've spoiled your sleep. - No problem. Okay, there may be some action, or there may be nothing. lf there's nothing, forgive me. lf there's action, enjoy it. Okay? This is the plan... Didn't l say he'd come? We'll move... See if he's alive. - No, he's dead. Adayar Patrol Van 1 , Anbuselvan here. Maroon Maruti approaching Adayar bridge. lntercept it immediately. Bullshit. The Maruti van is driving on the wrong side of the road. Adayar flyover. Are you on the same side? Surround it. Hey Police! Out of bullets or what? Bastard! Come on, man, come on... today's the day you die. While you die... you should know that your girlfriend is going to stay with me forever. Come on... Hey! Do you know who l am? l'm Pandia! Have you heard of me? The Maharastra police couldn't touch me... What the hell is the Tamil Nadu police going to do? Come on, man! Come fall at my feet, or die! l'm going to snatch that girl away! Hey! Anbuselvan! When l return her to you... you'll wish you had died today! That's okay, sir... but... Sir, l just received a Fax from the Mumbai crime branch... Pandia: contract killer, gangster. Mumbai police have filed 32 cases against him. Extortion, land grabbing, kidnapping. He was in jail for 6 months. He escaped from the prison hospital 3 months ago. Pandia. l had a hunch... An hour back, l spoke to the Joint Commissioner, Salem North. He gave me this information on the phone. Aathur is Sethu's birthplace... the one we killed in the encounter. lt's 48 km from Salem. Sethu's mother was a prostitute & his father was a pimp. We have these facts. The J.C.P. gave me one more piece which we didn't have. This incident happened 11 years back. At that time, Sethu was a small-time gangster in Tuticorin. He was 24. He had a younger brother who was living with his parents. One day, that brother killed his father & ran away. There was no further information about him. That boy's name was Pandia. The Pandia wanted by the Maharashtra police is the same... Sethu's brother. The one who escaped from the custody of Bombay Police... was living here for the past 3 months with Sethu. When we shot Sethu in the encounter, Pandia was there too. So, now he wants take revenge for Sethu's death. Simple! l'll arrange security for Maya's protection... Anbu, you give me a letter regarding this. Does Maya know about this problem? - No, sir. You all should be very careful. This guy seems capable of anything. l'll arrange additional security cover for everyone. Now, he's a wounded beast because of your counter-offensive. lf we think from that angle, his next move... Pandia, l know where they stay. A20, Sriram street, 70/2, phone number 37 12646. lt's the beach side of M.l.G.flats. Let's go. Let's go quickly. Sir, he's not a patient guy. He'll come... He'll come wild with rage. lf he wants to, he can hit us. Anywhere, any time... Sorry, were you sleeping? - Got drenched? - No, it's sweat. Anbu... l'll go to bed. Let's talk in the morning. Make yourself comfortable. - Sure. Swathi, where's Maya? - She's sleeping upstairs. ls everything okay? You're half asleep. Go to bed. ln the morning, Maya and l will leave this place early. Ask Srikanth to phone me in the morning. l'll sleep on this sofa. You needn't sleep here. l don't like anyone sleeping on this sofa. You go to Maya's room. lt's a big bed... You can sleep in a corner. Go... A.C.P sir... where are you going? - Sorry Maya, did l disturb you? l didn't sleep at all. Oh! Okay Maya, go to sleep, l'll sleep downstairs. We have to leave at 5 a.m. l'll wake you up. l just came up to tell you. Good night. - Where are you going? Sit down. Let's talk for sometime. How did the job go... successful? Sit down. Aren't you sleepy? Tell me... what happened? Maya, there's a problem. You're in danger. Because of me & my job... We're investigating... Until it's over, if you stay in a safe place... l'll be comfortable. Tomorrow let's... - Can l lean on your shoulders? l don't think there is a safer place than that. Crazy girl... Maya, this is serious! You're in danger. We should be careful. We should leave before dawn. Go to sleep. A.C.P. sir... How can l be in danger when you're here? Won't you thrash everyone, and save me? Even if they throw acid on you, you'll face them bravely, won't you? There's only danger for your enemies! Do you know how old l am? - 24 years. Ask me why l asked you. Why? l've been waiting for this kiss for 24 years. Now, l can't wait another second. What are you doing to me, Maya? Come and live with me... in my house. l want you. One month ago, you rejected me. Today you're saying that you want me. l think maybe policemen are fickle. You surrounded and killed Sethu. You were all acting tough then. Come on, do it now. - l want to know a few things. Where's the girl? The officers who were with you... where are their houses? lf you don't tell me, you'll die. l'm impatient. Hey! Don't sacrifice your life for a girl and your 3 friends. Won't you sleep? lt's 4.00 a.m. What's the use of sleeping now? You said we've got to leave at 5. Where are we going? l have class tomorrow... Take leave from school for few days. - No way. One second... Who is he, sir? Does he think a policeman's life is so cheap? He broke into an officer's house and murdered him... just to prove a point. How dare he! lla shouldn't have died. Sir, it's all because of Sethu's death. Sir, we were just doing our job, right? Was that a big crime? l feel responsible. We must kill him. Sir, we must kill him... Sure, but l don't want any more lives to be lost on our side. Safety first. Tomorrow morning, make arrangements for llamaran's funeral. Maya, only for few days... Okay? l'll inform the school, don't worry. l'm going to erase your details from the school records. Okay? l'll come there after a few days. Then, l'll bring you back here. Swathi? - We're sending her to Pune. Her brother lives there. She'll be at the airport now. Maya, for the time being, don't tell your sister anything. She'll get scared. Raja, don't stop the car anywhere. Maya... bye, okay? You can go. - Bye. Bose! Brother! Police! Police... He's 'Penknife' Kannan. He's Sethu's man. Sharp knife. Where is Pandia? l don't know. You can arrest me, l'll become a witness. You... Pandia, they've killed my brother... - Don't worry. Hey! Take him inside, Bipin. Give me the phone! What happened? You said you wanted to talk. We talked in the afternoon. l told you l was going to Pondicherry. That's it. Why this sudden move? Things aren't cleared up here yet, right? lt's only 3 days since Maya left this place. What's so urgent? l came here to talk about it. Sri, l can't stay here like a coward while she's there. l've decided. l'm going to marry Maya. Tomorrow. Then, after a few days... l'll bring her here. Sri, she should be with me in my house. lnstead of staying in some other place. lt's better for her to stay with me. Where are you going to get married? l don't know... ln her house, or in some temple. l need to consult her sister. l'll tell you after l get there. So you've decided? - Yeah. l've just told Arul. l was going to phone you, but then you showed up... Shouldn't we come for your wedding? No Sri. We shouldn't all be together in the same place. l don't want many people to know. Too risky. We'll have a get together after l come here. What's Swathi's number? l'll inform her. - She's staying in her friend's house. They don't have a phone. - l thought of telling her... l really need to tell her. - She'll phone me. l'll tell her later. When are you leaving? - Tomorrow, early morning. Will you call me when you get there? - Yes. Come sit down. What happened to you? Not feeling well? l'm fine. You want a drink? - l could do with one. - Sit down. To lla. - To lla... The next day, Maya & I got married. We didn't need to convince anyone. Of all the marriages I have seen, ours was the best. Sri, l'm Anbu speaking. - Hi Anbu, how are you? What happened? My wedding was performed at 2pm. Hey, congrats. Arul also asked me to convey his best wishes to you. Now where are you? Are you in her house? No. She has some property, 50 km away from Pondicherry. lt's on the by-pass on the way to Chidambaram. A wood cabin built on the backwaters. A beautiful place. We're spending tonight here. l'm calling from the place. l'll be here till tomorrow evening. l'll leave day after tomorrow, along with her. Don't worry. We'll take stock of things after you come back, okay? Sri, Swathi didn't phone me. l missed all you guys. lf you all were here, it would've been nice. She phoned me just now. She'll phone you. You keep your mobile on. Okay? Bye, buddy. - Take care. - Bye. Are you happy? - Yes. Why? l don't think you are. You look tense and worried. llamaran? - He was a good friend. That's okay. You don't worry about it. Are you happy? You wished for this, right? l'm happy. Certainly. l want to talk a lot to you. l want to tell you many things... How our lives should be... What l think about you... Lots of things. But ACP, this one night won't be enough for that. Tell me. l'll tell you. Close your eyes. - l'll close my eyes. Tell me. Hey, what are you doing? *l've uncountable wishes... *ls a day enough to express them? *Tell me. *l've uncountable wishes, *will a day be enough to express them? *Oh dear, *we'll ask the night to become long. *Oh Dream Lover! * l had dreamt only for this day. *Oh dear! Let's talk many things *through our eyes. *l like your nobility of *not being a loose-foot. *l like you talking *looking straight in the eyes. *l'll be in ecstasy when l see you *coming from a distance. *l'll be humming my favourite song. *Your face is a smiling face. *lt'll remain in my heart till l die. *l'm going to see my dream *in your eyes. *Clouds of twilight are *going in procession in the sky. *When l see them, they resemble *your style of walking. *l saw the sun drenching *in the river. *l waited for you to appear in sweat, *and l'm smelling masculine. *And l feel that l belong to you. *My joy is overwhelming. *lt's going beyond the sky. *l would like to die. Didn't l tell you l'd come? Didn't l tell you? Hey, cut him into pieces & throw him in the water. Hey, didn't l tell you to die that day? Kill him. Police, what man? Why won't you die? From now on, she's going to be with me. Watch. Bastard, this for Sethu. Anbuselvan, die... Hey, take her. My 'Khaki' uniform meant everything to me. Today, it was asking for my Maya's life. They would have taken her by now. It's all because of me. I shouldn't die. I need to save Maya. I need to save my Maya. Anbu, damn it... damn it. Arul, oh God! - Go away, man. Arul, he's alive... - Take him... l've got him. Sri, find out where Maya is. She may be in the house. *Will l get the message? *Will it come through the air *or will it get dissolved? *Will l get the message? *Will it come in the dream *or will it get dispersed? *Will it tell the message... *Will it run away half way through? *l saw Chinese words saying *''Only good will befall''. *l had kept red colour 'Dragon's picture', *'Laughing Buddha' on the southern side. *You over came all the obstacles. *You've proved 'Vasthu Sastra' false. *Oh cruel Demonl come & take me. *l've worn black dress. *l'm waiting in the darkness. *You came as a demon. *He's a batterer who gives me lashes. *Even though it pains, *you gave me pleasures. *l craved for your arrival. *l couldn't get sleep thinking of the past. *l don't want to get separated from you. *Please, come again... Yuck. Shouldn't l touch you? Okay, come on... Come on... Come on... Okay, don't come. Are you a north lndian? Which place are you from? You don't look like a Tamil girl. Your complexion & hair colour are superb. - Yuck! But, you're his leftovers. That's the only thing holding me back. You two consummated your marraige last night, didn't you? Was it good? Okay, don't wear this. You don't need this, remove it. l said, remove it & throw it aside. Anbuselvan will be lying dead under the water. Those 4 put on a good show, didn't they? They thought just because they had guns, they had a license to kill anyone. Won't this be a good lesson for them? From now on, every single cop will be scared to come forward. Tomorrow when they read the newspaper, will they call themselves ''Policemen''? No, that's it. ln a flash, they were all dead. You saw it, didn't you? That's life. For all of them, including Anbuselvan. Mother F... Sister, call the doctor. Which hospital is this? - Pondicherry Government Hospital. How many days have l been here? - Sir, since day before yesterday. Please be calm. Don't give that to me. l don't have time to talk to you. l'm okay. l have to go! Make arrangements for me to leave this place. l am Anbuselvan, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Crime Branch. Call ACP Arul. Phone No: 9841065486. Call him! Anbu, nothing has happened. Listen to me. Get out, all of you. l want to talk to them. All of you, leave... Go... Anbu, please don't strain yourself. Lie down. Listen to me. Srikanth, Swathi? Anbu, l betrayed you. l betrayed my job. Anbu, at that time, l didn't know what to do. They took away my Swathi. l don't know how they caught her. l just left her at the airport. They called me. They beat her infront of me. They said if l didn't co-operate with them, they'd kill her. Pandia, leave her. What do you want? Tell me, what should l do. l couldn't think about anything else... They sent me to your house. They hid a mike in my shirt & listened to our whole conversation. l exchanged your gun. They gave me a Walter P 88 gun like yours, with the firing pin removed. l told them where you would be on your wedding night. Anbu, l didn't know what l was doing. They stayed in my house the whole night. They allowed Swathi to talk to me once an hour. Suddenly, they left the place, early in the morning. Only then, l came to my senses. l called Arul & told him everything. We decided to come there immediately. We informed the commissioner. l phoned you on the way. But, you never responded. Before we came... Sri, what're you doing? Give it to me. What's this, man? Anbu, please don't forgive me. l've failed as a human being and as a policeman. When l think about it now, even my Swathi won't forgive me. Shoot me down. Anbu, it's not wrong. Shoot me down. Sri, she's not just your Swathi, she's our Swathi. Please, leave me. l'll go to him. Yuck. l don't want you. My boys are craving for you. lt seems they want you. Only 2, 3 men. Will you agree? Tell me. What is it Bose? Pandia, Anbuselvan isn't dead. He's been admitted in Pondicherry Govt. Hospital. He survived. ACP Arul, this woman's husband, Commissioner, all of them are there. Commissioner Bejoy Menon, l'm Pandia speaking. l need to talk to Anbuselvan immediately. Talk... Anbuselvan. on the line... Talk to him. Pandia... Maya, it's me... Maya, can you hear me? Maya, l'm sorry. lt's nothing. You don't get scared. Maya, l'll come there. Okay, lt's enough. Give me, l say give me. Stop it. Anbuselvan, l thought you were dead. l thought everything was over. l had told your wife to remove the auspicious thread. But you didn't die. So, it's not over right? Now, l'm going to put an end to this in my style. 150 kms. away from Madras. There's a place called 'SAAMAL SEEMA' near Andhra highway... lf you want her, come there & take her. She & the other girl. Bring those 2 f*** policemen friends with you. Bring every weapon your police department has. Anbuselvan, if you have guts.. if you want those girls, Come to that place now. You three alone. Hello. Swathi, you can go. Your husband is coming in search of you. Go to him. How can you go there without any security? lf they ask only 3 of you to come there. They may be ready to kill you also. We don't know how many of them are there. Come on, Anbu... first... Sir, we'll go there. We started it. We should only put an end to it. Please sanction weapons for us. l've decided to take you to a place. Let's go. Wash your face & get ready. We've to leave this place soon. You should look like an angel, okay? Wait... Sir, look there. Srikanth sir, look there. 'Srikanth' &'Anbuselvan'. What the f*** is this Anbu? Let us open it. No, Anbu No..l know what will be inside that box. Sri, there won't be anything in that box. l'm going to open it. Anbu, who's he? What does he want? Why should we fall at his feet? Can't we do anything to him? Shit. Hey, Sri... Oh God! Sir, control yourself sir. Hey relax... Srikanth, relax... Anbu, l'm not able to bear it. Anbu, is that Swathi? Tell me. Anbu, ask them to check whether it's Swathi. Oh! l can't bear it. Anbu, check whether, it's Swathi or not. l don't deserve to live. Anbu, sorry, l betrayed you. l betrayed you, Anbu. l betrayed everyone. Anbu, my Swathi died because of me only. Maya was kidnapped... l'm not fit to live. - Hey, relax... Be calm. - Sorry. Sri, what're you doing? Damn it, why? why? Hey, how long will you be sitting with a headless corpse? lsn't it disgusting? Take it away. Mother F... Have you heard of a woman called 'Varalakshmi'? She has a big bungalow. Bungalow full of girls. All are prostitutes. l'm going to leave you there. There's a great demand for girls like you. Within a week, all big shots in the city will... Then, all other men. lt's enough, if you stay there for 2 weeks. l'll call your Anbuselvan after that he'll come. He'll shudder & die looking at your condition. l swear, l don't like doing this, But your husband hasn't died yet. He should die, right? That's why... Where're you going? l'm hungry. l'll go & eat something. - Okay. Yes sir. Anbu is here. l'll inform him. Okay sir. Anbu, his name is Bose. Sethu's old henchmen. He knows where Pandia stays. Then, Maya is alive. He knows where they've kept Maya. They're going to shift her to some other place tonight. This is our last chance. Varalakshmi, don't show your f*** attitude to me. l can't come to the place where you want me to come. You come to the place which l choose. Pay the money & take this girl. l'll tell you the place within 1/2 an hour. Now disconnect the phone. F***, these women are such a torture. Pandia, police... Police... is coming. They've surrounded our place. Pandia, they've killed Ram & Chandra. Pandia, we should escape quickly. Quick... Quick... - Lift her... Take her. Hey, don't leave anyone. Follow him, chase Pandia... move... move. Come quickly... Maya... You're alright. Maya, nothing l've come... Boys, l need help... Arul. Maya, it's nothing. Maya, is it paining? Maya, do you hear me? Oh God! Maya, l'm not crying. l'm brave... Can you see me? Maya, l'm going to take you to the hospital. Doctors will take care of you. Maya everything will be alright. Maya, when you open your eyes, l'll be there infront of you. Even now, do you hear me? You'll repeat all these things to me later. Maya, l won't leave you. What? Still not yet seen? lt seems, it'll take 1/2 an hour for the boat to come. Go & kill him. Hey, Tamilnadu police, come man... Come... Hey bloody bastard... Come here... Come... Come to me.

Talk... Look, all of them are lying dead. How many people? All for one person. Sethu! Shit! He's garbage. He's a Virus. He should be destroyed. His death is good for the society. So, l destroyed him. You've come for him. l'll destroy you also. lf some other man comes for you, l'll destroy him also. *Police life is also a battle field. *But with a difference. *What's aimed at there isn't *a Policeman's life, *but his honesty, bravery and *beloved relationships, *'Kakhi' uniforms may have stains. *Because it's humans who're wearing it. *Just because a part of them *haven't still lost their humanity, *the lurking beast within us *is still quiet. *We sleep peacefully as they *sacrifice their lives for us. After 10 weeks... l've informed Forensic Dept. They'll be there within 10 minutes. l'll reach there within 15 minutes. Sir, l'll take care of it. *l'm not saying that it must be like this. *l'm just saying that this way it's nice. *Hereafter your life is *going to become colorful... see. >>
