Who is this Kekko Kamen? Directed by Takafumi Nagamine Kekko Kamen Mangriffon Announcer Academy My name is Mayumi Takahashi. I came to Japan from New Zealand six months ago. How do you say... Oh right, I'm a young Japanese returning ex-patriot. I wanted to be an anchorwoman. So I decided to enter this Mangriffon announcer academy. But this school was way different than the one in New Zealand. School regulations are very strict. We are constantly being monitored on camera by the head schoolmaster. If there is a student who shows disobedience or lack of respect... ...teachers bring them to the basement where they are heavily punished. Going out is forbidden, of course. That might be why Mangriffon announcer academy is... ...the most famous school for developing anchorwomen, but... The schoolmaster said that the policy of the school is... ...for the female anchors to be pure, righteous, and beautiful. A, I, U,E 0, A, O.. Ka, Ke, Ki, Ku, Ke, Ko, Ka, Ko...

You really need to memorize some Kanji. I memorized quite a lot. I can now write the numbers "one"” and "ten"! Well, I guess it's tough since you are a returnee from abroad. But if you don't know your Kanji... ...you won't be able to read any news manuscripts. That's okay. I'll pay a large sum of money to bribe the AD... ...and have him write the manuscript in Hiragana. That's why I have to be popular and save some money! You are putting your efforts in the wrong direction! Being an anchorwoman is a very tough job. Being an anchorwoman is a very tough job. Knowledge that is precisely researched and mounted... Reflexes that correspond to the comments of the interviewee... Only one who possess great intellect and physique... ...shall be chosen as an anchorwoman.. I really wanna be an anchorwoman! Our school was given the name "Mangriffon”... ...a combination of "Man" and the bird-creature known as "Griffon". Is that similar to cunnilingus? The anchorwoman has been named as the one who... ...brings imagination and spiritual presence to the world of mankind. This serious attitude that has been given to education... ...I am very deeply touched. I will allow admission. Will the guardian please leave the premises? Our school is a boarding school. For 3 years, I want her to cut all ties with the outside world and... ...master the arts. And now, onto a happier subject... Early this morning, sextuplets were born at a hospital in Tokyo. The mother of six babies is... Mizuho, she's fantastic... She's also a graduate from this school. Really? I'm gonna work real hard too! ...everyone was shocked. After these commercials, we'll have the weather. Pronunciation and fast speaking are still my weak points. But I hate this class more than anything. It's supposed to be a very famous text used for a play... ...but it's still full of Kanji! You, read. Yes. As all of you in attendance may know... ...the medicine which is obtained 80km west of Edo... ...has originated from the land of Chin, by a person named "Uirou."” Okay, that's enough. Next is Kyoichi's turn. Read. Yes. The medicine is taken from inside the palace and placed inside a crown... It's removed from the gap in the crown when it is used one tablet at a time. Okay. And... And the name of that according to... ...the emperor is "To-Chinko.” One more time! The name is "To-Chinko."” Say it articulately. The name is "To, Chin, Ko.” Continue. And if you separate "Tochinko”... It is comprised of words such as "peak”, and "see-through incense"... Say it louder! The name is "Tochinko.” What happened? Continue! As of now, this medicine... ...has extremely... ...has extremely spread all over the land. This medicine has extremely spread all over the land... You are having lots of trouble with your Kanji, Ms. Mayumi Takahashi. I'm sorry. Stupid Can you read this? Horse, donkey! You read this as "stupid"! That's what you are! Are you really putting any effort into this? Maybe you should just quit. You are a distraction to the other students. You may sit down. Mayumi's mother Ms. Mayumi Takahashi What is it? I have good news! I'm going to teach you a special lesson. A lesson? You didn't do very well today in class. That's right, that's why we need to teach you a lesson... ...in the torture chamber in the basement. Torture chamber? Oh, did you wet yourself? No, I didn't! Can't believe you wet yourself just from hearing... ..."torture chamber”. The fun is just beginning. No. Somebody please help me! We are going to work on your speech. Say this out loud! I can't! Say it! Say it now! M-Man... I can't say it! Ms. Mayumi Takahashi... You are attending this school in order to become an anchorwoman. Is that correct? Yes... And you can't even say the simple name of a location! Location? That's right. It's just a the name of a place. It's nothing to be embarrassed about. What's the name of the lake in Naha famous for its tideland? Manko. The beautiful crescent-shaped lake in Switzerland? Re Manko. When the female anchor says the names of those places... ...viewers seem to enjoy it very much. Re Manko! Aso Kokusai country club! Ome Koutsu! Bali Island Kintamani! Education is such a wonderful thing. Even if the student is not bright, it opens the doors of possibility. Let us open it! Yes. No! Please stop it! Please stop it! No! Stop it! If there is a door of possibility... ...could it be right around here? Don't talk back to us like that, you bad student! There is a need for more punishment! 1, Nakata, will punish you! It's time for a whipping! Study harder! Make an effort to read Kanji! I will study Kanji, so please stop it! It hurts! Stop it! Don't take teachers lightly! Scream some more! To an announcer, beautiful teeth are everything. Which toothpaste would you like me to use? Strawberry flavor? Or banana flavor? If you can't decide, I'll just mix both... Now, now... Open your mouth wide. Come on, open it. That's right, atta girl... Everyone loves white teeth. White teeth! White teeth! Let me examine your teeth... Good... Open wide! White teeth! White teeth! Open your mouth wider. Let me see the ones in the back... Let's see that wisdom tooth! Damn wisdom tooth! I'll make it clean and white! I'll brush behind the tooth too. What a beautiful leg! Oh, how wonderful! Wonderful, wonderful! You too? I prefer women. Kekko Kamen has arrived! How dare you teach lessons by giving such physical punishment! Even if heaven forgives your evildoings, I will not! Take a hike you perverted maniac! Could it be? Muffication! Muffication! This is just wonderful! Simply wonderful Wonderful... You are... I am Kekko Kamen. As long as you don't give up on your dreams, I'll always come to the rescue. You will? Really? Good... Who is this "K"? She is our greatest enemy, Kekko Kamen. In the past, she completely obliterated my first school, "Spartan Academy". What... Do something now! I don't care what dirty methods you use! Yes, sir. She was real. She was real! What was? Did you see a pervert or something? No! Kekko Kamen came to my rescue! Kekko? Kekko Kamen. You both heard of her too right? There was a legendary figure in the past named Kekko Kamen... Once, there was a person who fought for the dreams and... ...liberties of young people by exposing herself... But that's just a legend, right? She was real! So why did this Kekko Kamen help you, Mayumi? That's probably because... I'm a cute and admirable girl that never gives up on her dreams. You are so impudent. Where are we going? It's very dark here. I thought I would give you a special lesson. What are you doing? You have an ugly face, but your boobs are fabulous. It's such a waste for those precious boobs. Not to brag or anything... ...but if a girl's boobs are huge, I don't care what her face looks like. The secret organization "Mangriffon” was formed to recruit ignorant fools. It's a group consisting of very special folks. I have a special power to suck energy from your boobs... ...and turn it into a different type of energy! How does it feel to be reborn? Your name is now Akira Oshima. After sucking the energy from your boobs, you've gained a new identity I'm Akira Oshima... If you want to get your boobs back, you will do exactly what I say! Yes! Tell me what to do! Find out why Kekko Kamen came to Mayumi Takahashi's rescue. You got it? Keiko sensei! What are you doing this early? Yesterday, Kekko Kamen came to my rescue! Really? Isn't that like an urban legend? Kekko Kamen really exists! Thank you, Keiko sensei! But, I haven't done anything... What happened? My goodness. She has good instincts... Oh, welcome. It's such an honor to have you here, Ms. Mizuho Sakuragi. The director of our station told me to recruit someone from your school. I see. I would appreciate it if you could... ...provide someone of great academic achievement and human nature. I understand. Right away. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning! Good morning. Last night, a woman named Manko Kanazawa was stabbed to death... ...by her husband while preparing dinner in her apartment. According to the police, Mrs. Kanazawa was... ...preparing hamburger for dinner, but her husband came home irate. He told her "Stop cooking crappy dinners! I'll turn you into hamburger!” He then took a kitchen knife and stabbed her stomach repeatedly. Okay, good. Now it's your turn, Takahashi. Last night, a woman named Manko Kanazawa was stabbed to death... ...by her husband while preparing dinner in her apartment! No! Who the hell reads a tragic event with a smiley face? Sorry. You are sweating a lot, Mayumi. Mrs. Kanazawa was... You are soaked. ...stabbed her husband to death while... ...fixing dinner... Wrong! ...while preparing dinner in her apartment... Um... She was cooking a hamburger... ...but her husband came home and... ...stabbed her to death... ...saying "Stop cooking crappy dinners."” You messed up the sacred manuscript. I'm sorry... You feel cooler now, don't you? What's wrong? Read! If you don't want to take the class, get the hell outta here! Okay, now we'll continue with you, Kyoichi. Mayumi Takahashi Mayumi Takahashi Jun Takenouchi Kyoichi saw my panties! That's better than being glared at and flunking. I'd rather people see these favorite bear panties of mine. Does it really matter? But it's really frustrating. I heard a rumor that Professor Oshio is selling the videos of us. He calls them "the making-of a future anchorwoman”. What? Until we can graduate, we have to be obedient to our teachers. I'm introducing a new student. I'm Akira Oshima. Nice to meet you all. Sit right there. He's kind of cute, no? Yeah... Sorry to inform you all, but we are going to cancel today's class... ...to have a physical check-up. What? Our partner, MGF television studio, has informed us that... ...they need a fresh face for their news department. We will send one student from this school with a high academic record... ...who is in top physical shape. That's right! Everyone show up at the health office in 5 minutes! Furusawa, look after Oshima since we have very few men. Yes. Jun, give me one sip. Sure. Here you go. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you. You two! Move up the line. What are you all waiting for? What are you doing? Hurry and move, move, move, move! What's wrong? Oh, it's nothing. Just my stomach... You don't look well. Maybe you should rest? I'm okay... I need to get the physical check-up... You're not taking good care of your body. I don't think you can handle the job for MGF television. But... When the girls are done, you should go to the health office in 30 minutes or so. What about you? I don't feel well. Just tell the teachers I'm not feeling well. Hey Wakana, what was that stuff you put in Jun's bottle? What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about, I saw it. It was just a laxative. It's too bad she fell for it. That's terrible. Why did you do it? You heard what they said. Only one of us can get hired by MGF We're not friends, you know. We're all fighting for the position. You have to use everything necessary to get the job. I guess you're right. We can't be friends for long. Use every dirty trick you can. You know you can't beat me fair and square! What's that? Stop it, you two! I'm not going to talk to you anymore, Mayumi. We can't be buddies and expect to get the job. I thought I told everyone to come. Please forgive me. I'm not feeling very well. Come with me. You told on me? No hard feelings. You're the one who decided not to show up. I have no interest in men's naked bodies. But there is meaning to a check-up regardless of your sex. Why? Why didn't you go? You think you can get away? Why do you hate physical check-ups? Yeah, why? Huh? I think we need to check this one real carefully. What do you think? Stop it! Let me go! Let go of me! Stop! Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop it! No! Now, let's do a body check. Don't move, or I might cut your precious part... You are... You are a woman? Wait a minute... You have to use everything necessary to get the job! We can't be friends for long. Akira... Furusawa has been abducted by the teachers. Kyoichi? He didn't look like a bad guy, though... What's going on with this school? Body of a woman but a heart of a man. Totally my type! So... ...you must be Kekko Kamen! I don't know! I don't know anything! You should be ashamed of yourselves for picking on... ...innocent students and stripping them naked. You will all be punished! Contemplate your wrongdoings in hell! So this is Kekko Kamen... It wasn't Koichi... I see that the secret to Kekko Kamen's strength lies in her ability to... ...expose and reveal everything about the female body. That's right. It's an all out effort. I don't think Kyoichi can pull off anything that with the heart of a man. Men are creatures of vanity. They are unable to be defiant. Then who is she? Trust me. I will find out who Kekko Kamen is. Akira. Your smile is amazing. You're smiling from the bottom of your heart. Others too, right? Other girls are smiling with their mouth. It's the first time I've seen a girl who smiles like you do. Did you button yourself? My nails get stuck. You always take too long. Oh shit, have to hurry! Next class is Oshio's. Gotta hurry up! Huh? My panties are missing. Good morning everyone. Good morning. For today's class, we are going to experience ballroom dancing. Okay, everyone? Yes. Now to play the role of dance teacher, please do the honors, Mr. Oshima. Yes. And the reporter will be... ...\Wakana. Yes... Today's special news! We are going to cover the secrets to the very popular ballroom dancing. Let's ask Mr. Oshima about tips for the dance. You're very stiff, Wakana. Sorry... No, you're doing it all wrong. A smile is very important for a reporter, right? Without it, you can't capture the viewers' heart. Now show me a happy face. Happy. Smile. Good, very cute. Now let's try it one more time. Okay. Ballroom dancing is good for your health. It burns as many calories as walking. What are you doing? Focus! Yes. By using the legs, heart and lungs, you work out to the fullest. I guess the secret to its popularity... ...is the fact you can have fun while you exercise... No! What do you think you're doing? Taking a sacred class with no panties on! Sorry, there's a reason for this... You are messing with me aren't you? No, it's not like that... We're gonna have to teach you a lesson later on. I need to talk to you, Mayumi. Can I stop by your place later? What if Akira makes a move on me? Just in case he does... You know, "just in case"... Huh? My favorite panties are gone! Hey, do you know where my panties are? Who would take your panties? Hey, my panties are gone too! Somebody's stealing panties? No way! I was very surprised earlier... Wakana is one strange person, huh? Wakana's not that kind of a girl! I don't think she would do anything to disrupt the class. You really care about your friends, don't you? Great news, Wakana. Today, I invited a special instructor to beat some sense into you! Just remember... ...for this teacher, words are meaningless. Mayumi! What's wrong, Jun? Nothing... Who cares about Wakana? What happened to Wakana? She was taken to the torture chamber in the basement. How nice! I knew it! It wasn't just some ordinary lesson! There's no need to go and rescue her. She deserves to be punished, and lose her chance at becoming the... ...anchorwoman at MGF Stop saying that, Jun. Wakana did a bad thing by using laxatives on you. But getting rid of the competition by underhanded means ... ...is just not something I can do! Was it Akira's idea to use Wakana Nakai as bait? Yes. This bait should lure Mayumi Takahashi and that will lead to the... ...appearance of Kekko Kamen... Show yourself, Kekko Kamen! Your worst nightmare awaits! Looks delicious, right? I'll let you eat a lot! If I eat a live eel, I'm going to feel sick! If you have no desire to take lessons, you deserve to get severe diarrhea! Here they come. I'm trying to take the lessons very seriously! Please forgive me! They look yummy, don't they? Wakana! Wakana! Well, well, it's the underachiever Mayumi. You want to take some lessons too? Please let Wakana go! Let's see... Please open the door! You want to enter? Then say "please let me enter”. Please let me enter! Man, what a feeling! I'm glad to be alive! Wakana! Wakana! I'm glad you were able to say it, girl... I will give you a reward! Please, let Wakana go! I will let you have a lesson as well. Wakana! Wake up, Wakana! Wakana! Wakana! Someone, help! Ms. Keiko, I've been a bad girl! What's wrong? I feel bad for laughing at my friend's misfortunes... What happened? Wakana was taken away by Professor Sudo and Professor Oshio... They are unbelievable. They plan to provide more punishment... Mayumi... she went to rescue Wakana, without hesitation... But I... Don't worry. As long as you care for one another, she will come to the rescue. You mean... That's right. Kekko Kamen! Yes! Well... What is it? Maybe it's better that you leave now, for your safety, and for the plot. I understand. Good day. Go now. Okay. Go! Even if heaven forgives your evildoings, I will not! Kekko Kamen has arrived! You look wonderful each and every time! But I guess this is the end of the road for you. I have prepared a beast to take care of you! Not even you can beat this Behemoth! Damn you... Come down here! I'm here to rescue you two. Hurry! But, Kekko Kamen... We're only gonna be a distraction for her. Now let's go! We can get out of here! Come this way. Phew, that was close! Thanks a lot. It's freezing. I'm outta here. You two go on and do whatever you want. Are you all right? Now you are safe with me. Akira... Akira? Sorry about this, but I need to take you as my hostage. I'm the one who will reveal Kekko Kamen's secrets. An illusion in my heart, an orange muffler around my neck. I beat down the villains with my superhuman powers... They call me The Illusionary... ...Investigator? The Illusionary Panty! Come panties, provide me with your powers! Hey... Bear... These are my... No way! I have been reborn using the powers of Mangriffon! I took all the panties from within this school. Good bye, my first love... Now, to gain more power... I'll take those panties you're wearing now! Come down here already! No! Give it up! Stop it! Hold it right there! Panties are sacred to a woman. Not only did you steal them, but wearing them on your head is unspeakable. I will teach you a lesson! Stop right there, Kekko Kamen. Don't even make a move! I won't be responsible for what happens to her! Such a sight! Kekko Kamen... Take a look at this Illusionary Panty! Wow, wonderful! Now that is wonderful! Your moves have no effect on her! How are you going to defeat her, Kekko Kamen? Like this. No fair! This girl was also a victim. The real enemy is still around somewhere! The real enemy? Yes. The one who wants to destroy all your dreams and hopes. Could that be me, Kekko Kamen? ...or should I say Mizuho Sakuragi of MGF television! I know everything. I couldn't imagine such a talented anchorwoman appearing in that manner! Charging an unreasonable amount of money for tuition... ...and not even giving good lessons in return! You use the power of education and abuse it with shameful acts... I won't let you get away with this! You fools should appreciate what I have done. During your stay here in school... You can at least dream of becoming an anchorwoman. A dream that shall never come true in reality! To defeat you, Mangriffon has prepared several androids! His entire body covered in iron and steel, "Iron-steel Kamen." Able to deflect any attack with its turtle shell, "Turtle Kamen." With a great body, "Healthy Kamen." Ahh, it's totally disastrous! I'm so sorry, Mr. Nagai. That's okay, I forgive you. It's over, Mizuho Sakuragi! What? Who are you calling Kekko Kamen? W-Why are you... I was very suspicious of this school's illegal activities from before. Prepare to meet your doom! This camera is capturing everything! Here Mayumi, report this. I have already recommended you to my superiors. If this report goes well, you get the job! Really? Kekko Kamen is a person that loves good... ...and supports our hopes and dreams. She's totally awesome! Kekko Kamen leaps into the air! She throws a nice punch! Kekko Kamen's devastating nunchuku attack! Is he down? Turtle Kamen is down. Only Healthy Kamen remains! Muffication! Muffication! Wonderful! We are experiencing technical difficulties. I'm sorry Jun. I don't know what came over me. I acted foolishly just to get a job at MGF television. That's okay. From now on, it's just gonna be a fair fight. I got a letter from MGF! Open it, Mayumi. ...canceled... No way! Let me see that. Ms. Mayumi Takahashi. I'm very sorry to inform you that your employment... ...with MGF television has been canceled. To tell you the truth, that report had very high ratings. But that open crotch jump was caught clear on camera. It was live, so what can I say? And so I got fired as well. The boss was so pissed that... ...he figured the person that I recommend was worthless. What an asshole! You're probably better off that you didn't get the job. I'm really sorry. Oh, and don't worry about me. I got a job at another station. Well, ciao! Don't think this is the end of us. This will continue in "Revenge of Mangriffon.” Schoolmaster! Next time, on "Revenge of Mangriffon"... Person of... ...love and... ...justice. With her face covered by a mask... ...but her body exposed. She will protect... ...lovely girls from harm. Kekko Kamen will... ...keep on fighting. Please support Kekko Kamen!
