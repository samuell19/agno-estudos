ZANE: Water is a mystical medium because it evaporates. I loved Amy. I thought she loved me. Then about a year ago, she said, "I've found somebody else, I'm leaving you." DR. BERLIN: What about now? Picture a vast desert, a wasteland. Nothing in it as far as the eye can see, except for one tiny, lone figure. That's me, Dr. Berlin. I'm all alone. All my relationships are professional, except for my dog Wolfgang. I need someone to love. I don't know what the problem is. I mean, my career is going well. You know, I meet a lot of women, but I always seem to screw things up. I see. Do you? Yes. The dog barks, but the caravan moves on. Let's do some hypnotherapy. When I snap my fingers, you will relax, and go deeper. It is important to remember, always remember that Dr. Berlin is your friend. You can trust Dr. Berlin. Now, Zane, when you are out in the world, your subconscious will know that you are a masculine man. Women desire you because you are masculine. They want to use your body. Women want to have sex with you. (TV CLICKS ON) * Streets were wet with rain that night * Glistening with the neon light * The radio played soft and good * Dogs were barking in the neighborhood * There was a music all around (CAR PHONE RINGING) Yeah. Zane. Oscar Meyer here. Hi, Oscar. Uh... How are you? I'm doing fine, how are you? I'm pretty good. Listen, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you, buddy. What's that? The IRS has decided to review your tax returns for the last five years. What do you mean, review? You mean audit? (LOUD STATIC) Oscar, I can't hear you, you're breaking up. I'm going to have to pull over. Hold on, okay? (LOUD STATIC) I'm going to pull off here. What do you mean, review? You mean audit? Well, yes. Well, so... I don't have to worry about anything, do I? Do I? I don't think so. No. Look, don't worry. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Collect your things, come by my office. Bring your records. Oscar, I don't have any records. Oscar? Bring your records, okay? (STATIC CRACKLING) Oscar, I can't hear you! See you. Oscar. Hi. I like your car. You have a nice car, too. I was wondering... Would you mind taking our picture? No. Heck, no. Not at all. * They will never, never win * For the beat from underground Just push this button here. Where're you girls headed? Oh, we're going shopping. Want to come? No, thanks. I got to go to the studio. You girls watch TV? No, TV sucks. What about Rock-n-Roll P.I.? BOTH: That really sucks. * Wish I'd never known just how long * It was waiting * There to be found * Just underground * Lightning strikes on the earth and the sea * Wolves are running in the evergreen * Lay my poetry at your feet * Dance with me out in the streets * To the music all around * Of the beat from underground * I pray this night will never, never end * For the beat from underground * Hi, Janet. Hi, Zane. David's waiting for you. Could you get Oscar on the phone for me? He just called. He went to go see an attorney. Something to do with your audit. Zane, where have you been? It's 1:00. I've been waiting for you. We got big problems. What? Reno hates the new pages, Rock-n-Roll pain in the ass that he is. You got to talk to Jerry right now. Great. Now listen, guys. It looks like we got a temperamental star on our hands. But you know, in a way, he's right. I mean, the reason I love this job is not for the money. No. What gives me satisfaction is thinking about families sitting around in Middle America, you know, Grandma and Grandpa and their kids and their kids' kids, all together watching Rock-n-Roll P.I., Monday nights, 9:00, and no one's embarrassed. I mean, real Americans, real family. It makes me damn proud. It makes me proud, too, Jerry. Me, too. So, listen. Why don't you just rewrite the pages? We don't want the cops coming across like bad guys, huh? Reno's got some notes. He's on the set now. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Go on, go on, keep going. MAN: Roll sound. Speed. (BELL RINGING) Scene 17, take four. And, action! Reno. I know you think you can do anything, but this girl is deaf. Reno, she can't hear your music. I won't believe that, Pop. Oh, Son. I won't ever believe that. DIRECTOR: And cut. Great, great stuff. (BELL RINGING) I got tears in my eyes. That was fantastic. Well, look who's here. If it isn't the two young geniuses. Hey, about that new script, huh? It's shit. You've got to be out of your fucking minds if you think we are going to trash the police on Rock-n-Roll P.I. It's just one bad cop. Just one. Jerry, I'm not doing this stuff. One cop is a microcosm of the whole force. Besides, he comes off like a faggot. All right, we'll try to lighten it up a bit, but the whole show revolves around Scott being corrupt. I mean, there are corrupt cops out there. Oh, sure, I also saw women with penises on Geraldo. They're out there, but they're rare. That's obscene. Yeah, it's true, though. They're called she-men. That's great. They never have to leave the house. Look, Reno, we'll see what we can do. Yeah, listen, I got to go to my trailer for a minute. You okay? You sound like you got a cold. (CLEARS THROAT) It's just sinuses. Listen, I want to see those new pages in the morning and remember, pro-police. Who do you think you are? I mean, you are not a writer. That makes two of us, pal. No, I'm not a writer, I'm a star. I've got a 47 TVQ. Do you know what that means? I'm your meal ticket, buddy. People don't even know who you are. You know something, Reno... You're right. I know. Just do the new pages. (GRUNTS) Zane, are you all right? Who's that girl? Come on, let's go. No. No, wait a second. I want you to introduce us. But I don't know her. Yeah, but you're good at that kind of thing. Hey, look, why don't you go over there and you tell her about me, and then you call me over, okay? Don't tell her... Just tell her something good, huh? Let's get to work. Now, come on, Dave, just this once. Please? You know, it's people like you... Hi. Hi. I'm David. Penelope Powell. That's a nice dress you're not wearing, Penelope. Craves accessories. They come with the outfit? Just kidding. Me? Oh, you need me? Zane, this is Penelope Powell. Penelope, this is Zane Smith, the producer-creator of our show. It's nice to meet you. It's my pleasure. Well, David, we'd better get back to work, huh? Sure, I guess. All right. Nice talking to you, Penelope. Yeah. Yeah, it was really nice to meet you. You, too. Bye. Bye. (LAUGHS) We've been sitting here for two and a half hours. This is crazy. I just can't believe it, you know? I just can't believe it. I said two things to her. "Nice to meet you. Nice to meet..." I mean, she probably thinks I'm a total idiot. What are you scared of? You're the producer. The producer! She's just some day player. She wants to know you. Wait a minute. You're right. I mean, I'm the one who's in control here, right? I mean, she should be afraid of me, right? Right. Absolutely. I hate to use the word "genius," why don't you? All right. Now if that's taken care of, let's get to work. Okay. Let's start at the end. We don't want a corrupt cop. So let's make Monihan a P.I. This way it's good P.I. versus bad P.I. That sucks. Well, of course it sucks, but who cares? It's just TV. I can't believe what's happened to this show. I can't believe what's happened to you. You used to be the wonder boy. You could work out a whole story in 30 minutes, write an entire episode in two days. I've seen you wing it on the phone with a hostile network executive, and have him eating out of your hand. You were beautiful. What do you think she'd say if I said, no commitments from her or me? You know, no promises. Maybe the three of us could go out on a date together? What do you think? Whatever you say. Let's just get this done. It's getting late and we don't get paid by the hour. The only thing is, you know, if we all three go out together, it's going to seem more like we're just friends than a big date. (BELL RINGING) Quiet. Roll sound. Marker. Scene 110, take two. And action. Leave us alone! It was him! Hey, don't worry. Reno will save us. (BELL RINGING) DIRECTOR: And cut. Good. Good. No, never mind that, darling. Look, I want everyone in wardrobe for Scene 26, okay? That is a print. Where'd you find those girls? How you doing, Gino? Zane. Zane, you got a second? No, I don't. Come on. (ZANE CLEARS THROAT) ZANE: Hi. You're Penelope, right? Hi. Yeah, and you're Zane. That's a memorable name. Yeah, well, so is Penelope. Oh, sorry about that. It's a dangerous addiction. Yeah, well, I'm trying to quit, but it's not the easiest thing in the world, you know? I just came by to say that I was, you know, sorry about rushing out earlier, but I had some... Some writing to do. I thought you were the producer. Oh, yeah, I am the writer, producer, creator extraordinaire. You're pretty young. You must be real talented. Or lucky. You know what they say about luck. Yeah. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Yeah. Yeah. So, you're girl number three, right? Right. Yeah, you are very good. You got this quality, I don't know. Well, thanks. Did you write this script? Yeah, me and my writing partner, David, did that. Must be tough coming up with new ideas every week. Not really. Every show is really just a variation on the same theme. The networks say they want something new, but you give them something original and they just throw it in the trash. Why? I don't know. They're trying to break our spirits, I guess, make us obey. That's awfully cynical. It's also unfortunately true. You'll find out. That's pretty sad. Not really, you know. It's just the way it is. Doesn't have to be. DIRECTOR: First team, we need first team on the set right now. Guess that means me. Yeah, well... All right, well... Go get them, tiger. Thanks. Yeah. Come on. Come on, girl number three. Come on. All right. Let's loosen up a little bit. Loosen up. All right. Good. Now, this is a very easy shot, ladies. All right? Now, remember, Reno has saved you all from the lingerie serial killer, right? So, when he comes through the door, I want lots of excitement. I mean, go for him. Rip at his clothes. After all, you're grateful to this old big guy here for saving your life, right? And don't worry. You're not going to hurt him. Wait a minute. Some of these girls have got fingernails. Listen, don't grab at my face. I don't want to lose an eye. Oh, my God. Props! Here. Carol! That's all right. Carry on. Carry on, I'll fix it later. Come on. All right? DIRECTOR: All right, don't grab at his eyes. Listen. Stay out of my key light. All right now. Quiet on set. (BELL RINGING) Roll speeds. (WHISPERING) God, I love this business. Speed. Scene 26, take one. DIRECTOR: And action! (GIRLS SCREAMING) DIRECTOR: And cut. (BELL RINGING) Any problem? MAN 1: Good for camera. MAN 2: Good for sound. Print. Thank you all very much. See you tomorrow morning. It's a wrap! God, you were brilliant. Thanks. You probably won't even see me when it comes on TV. That's awfully cynical. Yo, Zane. What? I want to see you for a minute in my trailer. Oh, just a second, I'll... It's really important. All right, I'll be right there. I was wondering if, maybe if you didn't have any plans, that you might want to go to dinner with me tonight. Oh, Zane, I would love to, but, well, this is going to sound kind of stupid. I've been staying with some friends because I live so far away, and I had to be on the set so early, and Midnight, that's my cat, he's been home alone for two days, and I really think he needs a hug, you know what I mean? Oh, yeah, I know what you mean. All right. So, I guess, I'll see you tomorrow, huh? Okay. All right. Bye. Bye. (GIRLS GIGGLING) (GIRLS LAUGHING) (RENO EXCLAIMING) ZANE: What can I do for you? Is this unbelievable? Hey, kids. Want a drink? Thanks. Zane? Oh, no, thanks. All right, look, about earlier today, I know I was a little hard on you, but you've got to understand, I've got an image to uphold here. This is a conservative show. It's a family show. Now, I know it's fun to jump on the bandwagon and put the police down, but that is not me and that is not Rock-n-Roll P.I. Well, don't worry about it, we've already made the changes. Good. So, no hard feelings? No. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Anything else? And no, that's not it. What's with all the short answers? What, are you in a hurry to go somewhere? Yeah, I'm... Kind of. Oh, well... That's kind of a little bit of too bad, isn't it? I mean, I was thinking you might like to, you know, stay and hang out with the girls and I, and we might do a little dancing, maybe do some drinking, have a little blow and then bury the old meat puppet. Well... I can't tell you how enticing that sounds. (STAMMERING) But I just can't tonight. Shit, man, you never party with me. You're not cool at all. Uh-uh. Who are you, anyway? He's the producer. Oh, boring. He's boring. Come on, girls. ALL: Boring. You know, Reno, you do have a 6:30 call tomorrow morning. Oh, do I? Well, let me tell you something. First and foremost, I am a professional. I've never once been late for a call and the only lines I blow, buddy, are on my own time, so don't give me any of your fucking square rap. I try to be good to you. Now, get the fuck out of my trailer. Go on, get out. Come on, girls. Let's party. GIRL: Stop it. Hey, do you know if there's anybody left on the sound stage? No, man, it's a wrap. Everybody's gone. Do you believe in love at first sight, or is that just stupid? I know the answer to that. But I don't think you're ready for it. Hey. Hi, baby. You at the computer terminal again? (ANSWERING MACHINE REWINDING) (ON ANSWERING MACHINE) Zane, it's Oscar Meyer. I don't want to scare you, buddy, but the IRS thing may be a little worse than I first thought. Oh, shit. I forgot. I need to see you in my office first thing in the morning with all your records, and I do mean all of them. (BEEPS) (SIGHS) (PHONE RINGING) Hello. Hi, Amy, it's Zane here. It's my ex-fiancee. Who's there? Jamie. What do you want anyway? You remember that box I used to keep my receipts in? I need it. I need to know where the box is. Yeah, well, I burned it. You burned it? Amy, my poems were in there. That's why I burned it. Your poems are flawed. I'm not some flower, Zane. I can't believe you burned my poems. Those things are irreplaceable. Look, I've got to go. Jamie and I have some business to take care of before we go to Spago. Can I have the lobster? Sure, honey. I think I feel another poem coming on and it begins, "Life is just a shit sandwich." Yes, but if you have enough bread, you don't have to taste the shit. Goodbye, Zane. (SIGHS DEEPLY) (TV PLAYING WITHOUT SOUND) (TURNS ON SOUND) ANNOUNCER: Feel the heat, feel the beat, Reno is... Rock-n-Roll P.I. Monday nights at 9:00. Be there. What the hell is this? Those are my receipts. You're kidding, right? No. Come on. We're talking about a tax audit. No. No, we need diaries and credit card receipts, check stubs, everything. Oscar, I told you, Amy burned all that stuff. What's the big deal? You remember five years ago, when you first walked in this office? You said, "Oscar Meyer, I don't want to pay any more taxes." Yes. Remember that 7-to-1 investment tax credit I got you? Yeah, the solar deal. The tax courts disallowed it. Well, what does that mean? Could mean that all the taxes we deferred for the last five years, plus interest and penalties, are now due. Well, how much are we talking about, Oscar? Let's see. Two thousand dollars... Five years, plus interest... Penalty... Two thousand... Five years... Two thousand... Five years... Five years... Five years... Plus penalties... OSCAR: Hmm. I think we need to get together tonight. Tonight may not be good for me. I may have a date with this girl, Penelope. Penelope. Isn't it a beautiful name? Do you know where the name Penelope originates from? She was the wife of Odysseus, and she remained faithful to him throughout his entire journey. Why do you think they call it a myth, kid? Now, look, you've got to get your priorities straight. It's money, not some bimbo, that'll keep you warm in your old age. She's not a bimbo. She's an actress. Well, I'm not an accountant. I'm a revolutionary. Let me show you something. NARRATOR: The sun, the source of all energy, life, wealth and power. The sun, the source of all energy, life, wealth, power. Evil alchemists have created a net of laws to capture the force of the sun through taxation. Resisting these conspirators is an act of heroic, life-affirming defiance. The sun, a friendly star. Can you imagine them disallowing the sun? In ancient times, man worshipped the sun because it was so big and hot. Oscar, I'll call you about tonight. Staring directly into the sun can be injurious. (BELL RINGS) MAN ON MEGAPHONE: Transportation! Let's have the bike on set, please. This is the picture, folks. MAN 2: Roll playback. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) * My horse hide black attack jacket has an arrow half through * A bent harpoon held deep inside my flesh * I don't wanna know * I feel its barb each time I hope for the everlasting love * Of a heaven not of metal Of new earth, with new dirt * And escape from the lonesome * Trenches of the sea * For I have seen the Conqueroo * Pretty, little Conqueroo * I've seen the Conqueroo * Pretty, little Conqueroo DIRECTOR: And cut. Very funky. MAN: Turn the air off, please. Open the stage door. (WHISPERING) DIRECTOR: Reno, But I've got to go. It was good. Thank you. Keep it up. Hi, Zane. Hi. How you doing? Great. Who was that guy you were talking to? It's Todd, he's in my acting class. He is so sweet. (SIGHS) Is something wrong? No. You seem like you're mad at me. No, I just had a shitty day. You want to talk about it? I'm a really good listener. No, that's okay. I think maybe you just need a hug. Feel better? Yeah, that felt good. Oh, boy. Hey, I thought you'd quit that. Yeah, I did. See how easy it is? Yeah. What the heck? I'm just sort of stopping in between. I'm on my way to pitch a story. I... Really? What's it about? Well, it's... It's kind of hard to explain in a couple of minutes, but it's about this, you know this... I have such a hard time doing one-liners, but it's about this woman and this kid, they live together, you know. It's a really special story. It's not like the normal crap you see on TV. It's something I care about, it's original. Great, sounds interesting. Yeah. Would you have dinner with me? Ever? Sure. Yeah? Yeah. Beam us up, Ralph. She closes the door, the credits roll, the screen goes to black, the end. I like it. I like it a lot. I like it a lot. It's got a lot. You know what it doesn't have? It doesn't have a hook. No hook? It needs a hook. It needs a hook. Let me see, this lady's got a kid, right? Right. What's wrong with the kid? There's nothing wrong with him, except for the fact that he's lonely. No, there's got to be something wrong with him. Let me see... The kid's got a disease, that's it. Wait a minute... Better yet, he's deformed. There's your hook. That's a great hook. Yeah, great hook. Okay, give me the ball back, huh? Zane, give the man back his ball. Yeah, I'm on a roll now. So this lady has a deformed kid, right? So her husband leaves her and the whole neighborhood turns against her, and in the end, she marries her psychiatrist, and they start adopting other deformed kids, huh? You got me, you're on a roll. Yeah, I got it, now let me see. So they buy this place called Camp Love. That's where all the deformed kids get together and they live there, right? And at the end, the neighbors finally realize that it's more important to love these kids because they're special rather than hate them because they are unusual. That's a perfect ad line for TV Guide. Who do you see as the woman here? Well, you got me. Bonnie Franklin. No, Tyne Daly. Loni Anderson. Loretta Swit. Meredith Baxter-Birney. I've got it. Valerie Bertinelli Van Halen. Oh, say no more, I love it. Yeah, let me see, we'll call it Thalidomide Mom. Wow, that's pure Emmy bait. Yeah, there's only one problem there. I already have Amphetamine Dad and PCP Teen Mom in development. It's very... I don't know, let me give it some thought. Hey, but it was a great story, guys. Really. Yeah, but it's not our story. Hey, it was damn good. That was beautiful, baby. Oh, yeah? Let me ask you, what happened to you in there? That wasn't our story. That was a typical Hollywood nightmare. So big deal. He liked it, he loved it, he wanted it. It was standard TV schlock. I don't want to write that kind of stuff. Since when? That's the business we're in, pal. Doesn't matter whether it's good or bad, just as long as we get the money. So that's what it's all about, huh, Dave? I thought the best things in life were free. He says, leaning against his brand new Mercedes-Benz. (MOCKINGLY) Zane! Come back, Zane! ZANE: So, my dad's been gone about seven years now. I'm pretty much over the bad grief part of it, but I still really miss him. We were like, partners in crime, you know. What about your mom, is she still alive? She died when I was five. My dad pretty much raised me. So you're all alone now? Sure, rub it in. I'm sorry. I was only joking. Thank you, Tony. So she comes to Hollywood from Cheektowaga. And what, to seek money, fame, fortune? Sounds pretty good. No, I guess, I just really want to be happy. What does that mean? Being in love. So what about you? So does that mean that you don't have a boyfriend? Nope. Not yet. * Everybody knew it just couldn't last What about you? What do you want? * Oh, play it again * Play it again * Yeah, play it again Um... * It's not that easy to do * It's just like a song I don't know. * The melody is likely to elude * I feel really funny telling you this. I never actually saw Rock-n-Roll P.I. I'm sorry. You are bad. (CHUCKLING) What's it about? Oh, well... Originally, it was an idea that my father and I came up with a long time ago about him and me. It was a pretty cool idea at one time. It was about a writer and his son. And then the networks bought it and changed it. I didn't know your father was a writer. Yeah, he was a better writer than I am. But unfortunately, talent doesn't count for too much in this town. Well, what's it about now? Oh... Well... A retired motorcycle cop finds an orphaned teenage kid, beat up, in a dumpster behind a disco downtown. He adopts him. They work together as private eyes by day and rock 'n' rollers by night. You know, the ex-cop father, the rock 'n' roll son. Two generations working together. It's the perfect TV concept. It sucks. They sold us out. They? Yeah, the networks. I mean, they could have done something with it, anything. They could have made it off-beat, interesting... I don't know. It's just typical TV. They sold us out. Looks like you got a pretty good price. Mind if I play some music? No, anything you'd like. (POP MUSIC PLAYING) * Streets were wet with rain that night * Glistening with the neon light * The radio played soft and good * Dogs were barking in the neighborhood * There was a music all around * And the beat from underground * I pray this night will never, never end * Nor the beat from underground * Written down in fire and blood * A message from the God of Love * Promising her anything * Tear a feather from your wing * And sing a music all around You think I sold out, don't you? No, I think you see yourself as a victim. And I don't see you that way. How do you see me? * The beat from underground I don't know yet, but I like you. You're a good dancer. I'm a better kisser. * And the beat from underground * It's what they will never, never win * For the beat from underground * Everywhere was always silence I gotta go. It's late. When am I gonna see you again? I'll call you. * There to be found * Just underground * Lightning strikes on the earth and the sea * Wolves are running in the evergreen * Lay my poetry at your feet * Wolfgang, I think I'm in love. I don't know. Jeez. "Though spineless and lacking the rib of her magical origin, "I cannot but see how her eyes float in her heart." You say you're in love. Yeah. Yeah, I really think so. Why do you seem to be so troubled then? Maybe wanting to be great in someone else's eyes makes us examine ourselves more closely. Well, that's what we're here for. I just really think I sold out. Where does all this guilt come from? I just wanted to be a great writer, like my dad, you know. He was an artist. Well, as I understand it, he never really got anywhere. Well, that depends on how you look at it. I couldn't feel good about myself if I knew I willingly sold out. Maybe you were seduced. Was I? Let me ask you, would you rather have the money or the art? Both. Well, maybe you can't have both. Well... Well, if I said the money, I couldn't respect myself. And if I said the art, I couldn't afford you. Maybe we better have a little hypnotherapy. Okay, Reno is about to confront the high school crack dealer, when all of a sudden... She said she was going to call. Maybe I should check my answering machine. Sounds like a blow-off line to me. "Don't call me, I'll call you." (RINGING) (TAPE REWINDING) There's a message. Great. Come on, it's gotta be her. It's gotta be her. (ON ANSWERING MACHINE) Zane, Oscar Meyer here. Just calling to remind you about meeting the auditor at 3:00 today. Don't be late. (TOILET FLUSHING) Maybe she's uncomfortable, you know, because she's the girl and I'm the guy. And maybe I should call her. What do you think? Is it too soon to call her? No. No, it's not too soon to call. Go ahead and call her. Go ahead and call. Then we can get back to work. But we left it that she would call me. I mean, I don't want to come off too eager. Then don't call her. But what if she doesn't call? Zane, she'll call or she won't. Madness. So, what do you think I should I do? It doesn't matter! What's so special about this girl, anyway? What, does she swallow on the first date? Well, excuse me. I would expect that sort of talk coming from Reno, but not from you, old buddy. Pal. Sorry. Mr. Smith. Oh, you can call me Zane. Mr. Smith, I must say that for someone who has made as much money as you have these past few years, your records are not in very good order. Let's discuss this '85 solar deal. (STAMMERING) I know what you're trying to do here. You see, it's very confusing, there's a whole net of laws. What are you talking about? He's talking about how the government uses taxes to control the flow of energy and subvert the life force. The IRS has disallowed investment tax credits for solar energy partnerships. But that seems a little unfair. The government needs money. How much are we talking about? It depends. You claim $176,000 in deductions for entertainment expenses. What exactly do these deductions consist of? Well... Different things, lots of things... Taking out business associates, trips to New York, concerts, movies, videos, CDs, you know. It adds up quick. Just about everything I do relates to my job in some way. I am in the entertainment industry, sir. Really? Yes. Oh, I've got some receipts here. Now it's not everything, but... This is it? Don't you have a diary, something to substantiate these claims? Well, there was a fire. His ex-fiancee burned all his papers. Yes, it was a real mess, but things are starting to look up. In what regard? With my personal life. I met this girl. Well, anyway, what I'm saying is that, you know, I think, you know, I'll be much more organized in the future. You know, the Internal Revenue Service Code provides criminal penalties for tax fraud. Hey, come on now, we're just a couple of guys talking here. There's no need to be a hard-ass. I mean, it's not like it's your money. What, Oscar? All right, what about these video receipts? Girls Who Dig Girls, Women Who Dig Women, Chicks Who Dig Chicks. Research? My ex-fiancee rented those. I cannot believe that you are the creator of Rock-n-Roll P.I. My kids love that show. * Baby, when I think about you * It sends up a lightning flash * Through the sky map of secret messages * Above this world of temporary trash * And I hope you will remember * How he cut the sky in two * Renaming the constellations * Hi, Penelope, this is Zane. Penelope... Hi... Penelope, hi. Hi... Hi, Penelope, this is Zane. Had a good time last night. Hope you did, too. I'm in my car phone if you want to get in touch. Yeah. (DIALING) (RINGING) (RECORDING) Hi, this is Penelope. I'm not in right now, but leave a message and I'll get right back to you. (BEEPS) Hi, Zane, this is Penelope. Hi, Penelope... This is Zane, I wanted to... How you doing? Listen, I'm in my car phone if you want to, you know, give me a call back. So, then... You know... You can give me a call me back then, all right, bye. (POLICE SIREN WAILING) Hi, buddy. Hi. I really blew it this time. What are you talking about now? I call up Penelope, I get her machine, and the first thing I say is, "Hi, Zane, this is Penelope." Is that all? Is that all? Don't worry about it, she'll think it's cute. Cute. How can you eat at a time like this? (MAN CHATTERING ON PA) Oh, by the way, I talked to John Clark's people. They're gonna pass on Thalidomide Mom. They're going with something called Percocet Dad instead. Percocet Dad? Yeah, you know, Dennis Weaver hurts his back on a construction job. Doctors prescribe Percocet. You know the rest. Oh, good, I'm glad they passed on it. But we gotta sell something. I need to get some cash fast. The IRS is on my ass. Ed, don't do that. How you doing, David? Hi, want you to meet Zane Smith, my partner and the writer-producer of the show. How you doing? This is Ed... Polinski. Poliski. Ed's a real life P.I. Reno and Jerry hired him to be technical advisor on the show. Great. Yeah, I did some work with Barnaby Jones, Manimal, Sonny Spoon, couple of other things. I work with the writers, so you guys got any questions, I'm here to answer them. Marker. DIRECTOR: Action! I said, "Action!" You know, Pop, seeing those orphans on skid row made me realize just how lucky I am to have a dad like you. I sure love you, Son. Love you, too, Dad. Sing it, boy. * In downtown Los Angeles * Beneath a cloud of smog * I've heard the thunder and lightning flash * of Pop and Reno... Cut it. Cut it. DIRECTOR: Cut. What the fuck is wrong with you? Can't you remember the lyrics, old man? It was you, Son. Oh, shit. I'm taking a break. MAN ON PA: Take five, everybody. Hog. Christ. Fuck off. So, I see you met my good buddy, Ed. Actually, we just met yesterday, but I feel like I've known him my whole life. Hey, we're going to do some serious partying tonight, huh? No shit, man. You got that right. Hog! Listen, I gotta talk to you about Pops. I think he's got Alzheimer's or something. He can't hit his marks. He can't remember his dialog. He's making me look bad, and if I look bad, everybody looks bad. (PHONE RINGING) Excuse me, I have to get that. MAN ON PA: Connie, tell the drivers that the stretch-out is in the shot. The stretch-out needs to be moved off camera, please, right now. MAN 2: Transportation, let's move those bikes back into position one, please. Hello. PENELOPE: Hi, Penelope, it's Zane. Hi, I... I felt really stupid about that message. I thought it was cute. What are you doing? We're downtown. We're shooting on location for the show. What are you up to? Just taking a bath, shaving my legs. (CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) Yeah... Guess what? What? I quit smoking. You did? That's great. Just give me a second. And I guess that makes you and the Surgeon General happy? You're so silly. So... So, do you feel like getting together later maybe? I can't today. I made plans with my girlfriends, but I'm not doing anything all day tomorrow. (STAMMERING) Well, that sounds good. Then maybe we can spend the whole day together. How does that sound? Sounds like a date. 10:00? Great! I'll see you tomorrow, all right? Okay, goodbye. Bye. Yeah! (WHOOPS) Feeling good, Pop. What do you need? Zane, I want to talk to you about Reno. Seems like he keeps putting me down in front of everyone. Yeah. More and more all the time. Why? He's got a real attitude problem, you know. I'll try to talk to him about it. Look, Zane, he's young and he's good... We sing his songs, not mine. He gets all the best lines. I'm a star, too. But you know something, the little shit forgets where he came from. He's got a real attitude problem. He does, doesn't he? Can you do something about it? I'll talk to him, Pops. I appreciate it, Zane. We old guys just got to stick together, right? (ZANE CHUCKLES) I was thinking both of you. All right, Pop. We'll see you later. MAN ON PA: Tony Lamont, you have a call on the portable phone. Tony Lamont. Got me a date tomorrow, spending all day with Penelope. That's great. Yeah. A little nervous, though. I'm getting a little bit anxious, you know? Just be cool, be yourself. That's all. Yeah. Impress with success. Yeah. I just don't want to blow it, though. You know what I mean? You know, you might need some real advice. Maybe you should talk to Reno. No, thanks, David. Let me do this. Reno, you got a second? Seriously. Both of you. David. I'm doing this for you. Reno. Think about it. Yo, what's up? How you doing, big guy? Zane needs a little advice about women. Something you know a lot about. That's for sure. What is it? It's really nothing. Nothing. He's going out with this girl tomorrow night. He thinks she's really special. He's kind of nervous, doesn't know how to act. Maybe you can give him advice. Does she do blow? I don't think so. I'm gonna leave you two guys to talk. I'll catch you both later. Well. Let me give you the cardinal rule. Fuck her ASAP. If you don't, you're gonna wind up just being friends. God knows, you don't need any more friends. What if she's not ready for it? They're always ready for it. If she says no, she means yes. If she says stop, she means go. Trust me. I've been through this many times. I know what women want. Listen, I really appreciate you taking time to give me advice, but I think I'll just be myself. I'm just a little nervous, that's all. Look, you either want my advice or you don't. Come here, come here. I think what's going on here is that you're just... You're just scared. Take a couple of these if you start to get nervous, and I promise you, you won't be nervous anymore. No, thanks. Come on, take them. Reno, I don't want any weird drugs. It's not a drug. It's an oriental herb. You know, like ginseng, totally natural. Hey, I wouldn't lie to you, pal, just trust me. MAN ON PA: Check your marks, people. This will be a take, this will be a take, not a rehearsal. Sorry I'm late. That's okay. There must have been a 92-car pileup out there. I don't know what the heck is going on on those freeways. You look really pink, nice. Thanks. (SEAGULLS CAWING) Hey! Hey, guess what? What? Guess! I don't know, what? I'm Jesus Christ. I am, I'm Jesus Christ. Well, nice to meet you, Mr. Christ. Don't know what to say to him. (PENELOPE LAUGHS) Hey! Hey, you two married? I can marry you. Yeah? I'm Jesus Christ. It's a fact. Okay, marry us. Are you gonna be straight with her? Are you? Are you? No? Yes. Are you going to be straight with him? Come on. Are you? Come on. Yes. Eat this cracker. Eat it. We've already had lunch. Unless you partake of the holy sacrament, this union is cursed. Well, I certainly can't afford another curse. Well, that's a boy. Nothing wrong with that cracker. All right. You're married. Very interesting. You have a very long lifeline. I do? But it is broken early on. What does that mean? Oh, it could mean many things. What about my love line? It is very jagged. Broken. You're very alone. Not happy. Well, will I ever find happiness? Not in this life, I'm afraid. "I should have been a pair of ragged claws "scuttling across the..." How does it go? "Floors of silent seas." Something wrong? Nothing. I'm just kind of bothered by what that woman said today. She doesn't know anything. Yeah? She was just reading your vibes. Well, she read them pretty good. I am alone, aside from Wolfgang, and he's almost dead. You should be happy. You have a very interesting career. So creative. There's a one-eyed monster that hypnotizes people and makes them stupid. Burns light. Money is the heat it gives off. What the hell are you talking about? Television? Yeah. Then why do you do it? Money. You don't seem like the mercenary type. Society is coming unglued, and the only thing that's really holding it together anymore is money. All the things that used to be for free, like clean water, security, safety, you know. Everything now you have to pay for. Someone to take care of you when you grow old. I thought I could beat the system. I really did. Maybe it's your attitude. You're so full of negativity, maybe all that negative energy you put out comes back to you. Did you ever hear of karma? Is this karma, hair in my lobster? I'm talking about instant karma. What you put out comes back to you. I don't believe in it. I mean, look at my dad. My dad put out so much good, you know, and all it did for him was... I don't know, I mean... I mean, she said I'm never gonna find happiness, right? So I'm probably never gonna find happiness. She said it was unlikely, not impossible. Aren't those the only things worth doing? Things that seem almost impossible? All right. Well, here's to the almost impossible. Here's to love. * Look deep into the sky-blue waters clear * Use your imagination Find the questions there * Clouds form a picture Before they leave * Is it the truth, or just something that you're wanting to believe? * Yesterday was shown * To tomorrows yet unknown * Passions of a star you are * I'll know you when I see you * I walk the world I walk the world * I walk the world I walk the world * What do you think? Great taste, really. (CAT MEOWS) This is Midnight. Hey, kitty. He's the friendliest cat in the whole world. Yeah? Hi, Midnight. Kitty. (HISSING) He doesn't hate anybody. Must be my dog. He must smell my dog. It must be. Good boy. Good night, Midnight. (SIGHS) Do you want something to drink? No. You wanna watch TV? No. What do you wanna do? (MOANS) Zane, wait. Mmm? Zane. What? I have to tell you something. What? I really care about you. I really care about you, too. I've never been with anybody I really care about. So that makes you almost a virgin. Psychologically speaking, yeah. That's why it has to be incredible, you know? Yeah. Yeah, I want it to be incredible, too. I mean, really, really special. That special, huh? Could you tell me where your bathroom is? It's next to the kitchen. Okay, don't move, okay? I'll be right back. Okay. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Relax, get a hold of yourself. She said it has to be incredible, not perfect. God, I wish I had a cigarette. Well, it can't hurt. You took a long time. Are you okay? Yeah, just feeling a little faint. I just splashed some water on myself. Sit down. What's that? This is my photo album. What's that picture of? Is that a real picture? On the beach. It's so sweet. Can I see your pictures? Sure. This is when I had dark hair. A glamour shot, huh? That's nice. That is a great shot. You know... That could make you a lot of money, if you went out on commercials. It's a great commercial headshot, it's beautiful. You want to see the first commercial I ever did? Yeah. You have it? It's kind of stupid. You might have seen it really late at night. All right. It's my very first job. Let's get it on. (LAUGHING NERVOUSLY) Here, I'll do it. Excuse me. You got it? Yeah. PENELOPE: I understand, Mr. Sanders. Bob's been sick a lot this year. (BABY CRYING) Please give him another chance, sir. It's the holiday season. (CHUCKLES) MR. SANDERS: Yeah, but I've got a business to run. (GIGGLES) That's my problem. This guy's, like... He's so intense. He should be a star, this guy. I understand, sir. And I'm sorry. I can't lie for you anymore. I'm sorry, honey. I'm just too tired to go to work. Your marijuana smoking is ruining our lives. I'm sorry, honey. I'll quit, I swear I will. You always say that. You need help. (BABY CRYING) He's very funny. (LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY) I love this commercial. I've seen it so many times. That's great, and you... That's it. You're amazing. (SLURRING SLIGHTLY) You have the most unbelievable presence. I mean, on film you have something special. Thanks. You're really beautiful. You know that? Thank you. I really like you. I really like you, too. Yeah? I really had a good time today. Zane. Huh? What's wrong? You're slurring your words. (MUMBLING) Nothing. God, I feel so loose. I'm feeling good. I feel like... I don't know. The Incredible Whatever, you know? Maybe you got a bad lobster. Huh? Maybe the lobster that you ate was bad. I'll take you home. Tasted good. I don't know. Come on, let me drive you home. Where're you going? Come on. You'll get a good night's sleep. I don't wanna go. Zane? Zane? You're home. Home. There used to be a chair here. It's getting kind of hot in here. You know, you don't have to leave. No. I don't. (MOANS) (PENELOPE MOANING) (PHONE RINGING) (PHONE CONTINUES RINGING) Hello. DAVID: Hi. Hi, what's up? Nothing. Just called to find out about the big date. Oh, yeah, it was fantastic. Well, did you sleep with her? (GROANS) David, it was so beautiful. It was better than I could've ever dreamed about. She was like an animal. She clawed my arms, she ripped off my clothes. She made me bleed, David. I mean, it was unbelievable. Sounds wild. You have any pictures? Uh... (SNEEZES) Bless you. David, my clothes aren't ripped. I'd like to know what's going on here? Zane, are you okay? I don't know. I don't know, David. I don't remember. I don't even remember the last thing that I do remember. Reno gave me these pills. Shit. Zane, what pills? Jesus, I must have hallucinated the whole thing. I don't believe this. (SIGHS) Oh. I don't know, David, some oriental herbs, he said. Well, did you sleep with her? I can't remember anything. I hope I didn't do anything embarrassing. David, what should I do? Should I call her? David, I gotta go. (HANGS UP PHONE) (RECORDING) Hi, this is Penelope. I'm not in right now, but if your message is urgent, I can be reached at 818-555-1534. Bye. (LOUD POP MUSIC PLAYING) (PHONE RINGING) Hello. Hello. Yeah? Who's this? This is Steve Elias, who's this? This is Dick. Is Penelope in? You just missed her. She went home to get some things for tonight. Your nipples are so hard. Who is it? It's for Penelope. Is that Penelope? I'm so horny. Penelope. Let's go back to bed. Hello. Hey, later, guy. Hello! (DIAL TONE DRONING) She said she cared about me. Words. Words are like toadstools. In the morning, the lawn is empty. What do you say we do some hypnotherapy, huh? (SNAPS FINGERS) As you go deeper into hypnosis, you will come to realize that the nature of women is duplicity. Penelope is a liar. She's lying to you. Well, women, they don't have the strength or the power of the male, so they are practiced in the art of deception. Women, they are like streetcars, anyway. You miss one, another one comes along. This is a man's world, and you are a masculine man. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (SOFT POP MUSIC PLAYING) PENELOPE: Who is it? Zane, hi. Come on in. How are you feeling? I took a cab home after you fell asleep. You were acting really strange. I'm just watering the plants. You want to come outside? It's beautiful. Sure, it is a beautiful day. I was really worried about you. (CHUCKLES) I bet you were really worried. I was. Mmm-hmm. Who is Steve Elias? What? I called that number you gave me earlier today. Who is Steve Elias? Oh, Steve, that's Kathy's boyfriend. Don't lie to me, okay? I'm not, Zane. I heard him on the phone, I heard him saying your name. I heard you talking to him, "Your nipples are so hard," I heard the whole damn thing. What are you talking about? Why didn't you just tell me you had a boyfriend, huh? I mean, here I am thinking we have something special starting, and you're... It's some sort of game to you. Don't you remember, I told you last night I was going over there? All I remember is thinking that I knew somebody. And I guess I didn't. I don't believe this. You don't trust me at all. I don't appreciate being manipulated. * A different lens now bends the light around your face * And one last silhouette * Your shadow is erased * Don't ask me who I want beside me now * These silent rocks and dust will teach us now * The blessing of dynamite * Shock waves and flashes of light * Voices talk as thunder might * Words waiting within you * The blessing of dynamite * Blast off light like rainbow bends before my path * Color of light * Hear all the junk exploding * With all their lines * Don't ask me who I want beside me * These silent rocks in the sky will hide me * Hi, boy. (WHINING) You wanna give me some room? (EXHALES HEAVILY) Looks like it's time for our favorite show, Wolfgang. ANNOUNCER: We've got one good option. Choosing the card... Old boy, it's just me and you. You and me against the world. Wolfgang? Wolfgang. It pays to discover the card that pays you back. ANNOUNCER: Tonight on Rock-n-Roll P.I... You don't understand, Lucius, steroids are gonna kill you. No, you don't understand, man. I gotta get pumped up, I gotta win. Win today, you lose tomorrow. Lucius... Lucius, your parents care about you, son. So? (WHOOPING) They want our secrets, how to get big, how to get women, how to build up your biceps. Those guys ain't even cops, man. They're P.I.s. Suck on this, Reno. (LAUGHING) (GROANS) Somebody call an ambulance. Hang on, buddy. (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) (CAT MEOWING) You okay? I need to get you to the vet, boy. You don't look like you're feeling too good. MOTHER: Mr. Reno, I found pills in my son's room. I guess we both could use a good night's sleep, huh? RENO: Anabolic steroids. Also known as juice. The bottom line is that you owe $487,632 and 21 cents, payable now. How can that be? You got a 7-to-1 write-off on that $50,000 tax credit. That's $350,000 plus interest and penalties for five years, that's close to a half a million dollars. I guess I have to pay it. How? You have your car payments, your house payments, you live a very expensive lifestyle. You don't have half a million dollars in cash. Look, I know it sounds tough, but I can handle it, okay? I mean, what choice do I have? Besides, there are worse things in life. What, are you dying? Yeah, kind of. Look, we'll pay it off over time, okay? We'll take the penalties. I'm the producer of a top ten TV show. That's guaranteed income for four or five years, not to mention syndication. Listen, kid, I've been in this business for a long time, and the one thing I've learned is that nothing is guaranteed. Look, I've got a sick dog. I really have to get going. (INTERCOM BUZZING) Yeah. SECRETARY: Jerry for Zane on one. Zane, this is Jerry. What is it, Jerry? I'm kind of busy. Reno's been arrested. What? They found him with four ounces of cocaine and some barbiturates. They're talking about charging him with intent to distribute. Intent to distribute? You know our technical advisor, Ed? Yeah. He was an undercover cop working on a sting operation. He's the one that busted Reno. I can't believe this. You haven't heard the worst of it. The show is shut down, effective immediately. A midseason replacement kicks in next week. No more episodes? No. None? None. No reruns, ever? The show is finished, it's all over with. All right, I have some things to take care of. I'll call you back later. Tough break, kid. Well, maybe this is karma. What do you mean, karma? You know, what you put out comes back to you. Maybe I deserve this. I don't know what I'd ever do if I lost you. What next, God? (TIRES SCREECHING) (ZANE SCREAMING) Wolfgang! Wolfgang! (IN A DISTORTED VOICE) I love you. (WHINING) (WOLFGANG BARKS) (GROANS) (EXCLAIMS IN SHOCK) (CAR CREAKING) (CAR CRASHING) (GROANS) (HORN HONKING) (HORN HONKS) PENELOPE: Who is it? It's Zane. Oh, my God, what happened to you? I just wanted to clear things up. Sorry about yesterday. I was out of line. I was wrong. What happened? I've lost everything. Why are you smiling? I love you. * Experience the calendar of old * I've been on my own since I was 15 years old * Rocking my worlds Great fire on the wall * Some say it's out there They'd better watch out when it falls * And the rock, the hammer explodes * Where would you be if the fire were still flaming? * 'Cause I'm making a way Making a new way now * I don't know when or how * Making a way Making a new way now * I don't know when nor how * Missed the economy House of credit cards * Elevate executives Execute the bards * I'm standing here at the crossroads of my life * Walk, while round my father Brother, friends, my son and wife * And the rock, the hammer explodes * And threatening us with a fistful of mayhem * 'Cause we're making a way Making a new way now * I don't know when nor how * Making a way Making a new way now * I don't know when nor how * Great big brass Crucifixion screws * Twist through walls But what can I do? * I sold to a war my love for you * Just two things I wasn't born to lose *
