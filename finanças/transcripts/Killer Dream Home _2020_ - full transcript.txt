you know, I have another phone in here. And I'm calling the police. Just... -hi! -Hey! So I think I found our next flip. Yeah? I... I didn't see you looking through listings today. Well, that's 'cause it wasn't up yet. But I happened to drive by this morning. -And where would this be? -Over on maple. Not the one with the big boujee gates. No, stop! But why would that place be for sale? I don't know, but what I do know is that we just made a killing on the aspendale sale and now we have some real equity to play with. Yeah, but that place is huge. I mean, it's probably like, what, five, six, maybe? Seven, eight... - Exactly. - But, come on. The receptionist said there's an elevator inside. -An elevator? Ooh! -An elevator! Well, that is a lot of money to pay for an elevator. Well, so what do you think? Are you in? I think that is a really big mortgage and we have a lot to talk about. -Who's the realtor? -Renee rivera. And I'm just waiting on a call back from her. -Didn't she just get a divorce? -I think so. So, you know, maybe you can work your magic on her, take one for the team. you are unbelievable. She is, kind of a babe, though. Hey, I am holding an apple and I'm not afraid to throw it. Love it when you threaten me like that. Well, I'm gonna go blow up her phone and work my magic. it's like a dream come true. Well, if you missed versailles... Versailles did not have an elevator. well, touche. Okay. And this is probably the guest house, right? your living quarters. - ha-ha-ha... - perfect! just look at it! look at it. My gosh! -Wow. This could be ours. -Okay. - hi, ladies. - Hi! Hi there. -Jules and josh? -Hi. - Yes. Hi. - So nice to meet you. I'm renee and this is my assistant, desi. - Very nice to meet you both. - nice to meet you, too. I'm impressed that you remembered our names, I mean... -We only called like hu-hundred? -Dozen? -Dozen... Hundred dozen? -Yeah. Yeah. Something like that. I love a hungry buyer. And I love your shoes. Thank you! I just wish they love these stairs. But then, that's what the elevator is for. elevator! -Shall we? -Yes, we shall. Great, did you guys get a moment to see the beautiful garden coming up? we didn't miss it. It's, it's pretty good. - It's a decent garden. - gorgeous, yeah. wow. - Yeah. - I mean... I'm sorry, what, what year did you say this was built? - um... - Wait, wait! Can I guess? sure. Yeah. 1986? Good guess. 1985. - The year we were born! - Yeah. I think it's meant to be. All right, let's go this way. So through there is the library and the home theater which we'll show you on the way back down. And here, of course, we have the kitchen and the formal dining room through there and the breakfast room here. And now we'll make our way up. So how many rooms are there? We have the one bedroom downstairs, four bedrooms up here, including the master suite, and that one right over there is used as a study. And here we have the master bedroom. Powder room, walk-in closet's right over there. And through there we have the master bathroom. -Is it big enough for you? -There's a... There's a his and hers sink. Yeah. Okay. Can, can we maybe take the elevator down? so you like the elevator. - yeah. - kids love the elevator. you guys have kids? That's a, it's more of a mid-thirties thing. We're not, not there yet. - do you have kids? - Desi has a child. - A two-year old. - aw! I loathe children. They're smelly and loaded with germs. That's fair. Wow! That's a, that's a real-life elevator. - Okay. - my god! okay! Save the best for last, I guess. -Wow! -Yes, the pool is gorgeous. And so are the gardens down below. We still have edgar here whom we kept on contract for the showings, but it'll ultimately be up to the buyers whether to keep him here after or not. Was he the one I saw out front? He was ms. Maple's gardener for about a year and a half? Since before her husband passed. He knows the property like the back of his hand. He doesn't just do the gardening, he does plumbing, repairs, you name it. -Nice. We need one of those. -I think so. He actually stays in the guesthouse at the bottom of the hill, um, but has a place in town still as well, if I recall. He does, I think ms. Maples really just enjoyed having someone around, you know? Speaking of ms. Maples, we were wondering why she decided to sell the house. Um, y-you know, just so that we have full disclosure here, you guys should probably know that ms. Maples did die, in the house. She fell and hit her head in the garden tub upstairs. - That's, that's awful. - Wow. it is, it is. Um, it is. And she didn't have any living relatives and the estate went back to the state and so here we are. So... We can, um, go ahead and go through this way. we really appreciate you showing us the house. -I mean, it's beautiful. -Of course. We do have a full weekend of showing the estate to other buyers, but most certainly let us know what you guys decide, yeah? Yeah. No, we definitely will. -Okay. Right. -Thank you. -Appreciate it. Bye. -Of course. Happy home hunting. I mean, yeah, the house was great, but think we still have a lot to talk about. What is there to talk about? That estate doesn't even need flipping. All it needs is a badass interior designer to help double its worth. Yeah, I thought you wanted to do all that. The place is huge, I'm gonna need some help. Okay, babe, interior designers aren't cheap. Well, we want what's best for the house, right? Look, it's not even our house yet. Okay, not to mention that the woman died there. And I read online that the husband got sick and died in the house, too. So? So that freaks me out. Look, this is literally my dream house. The one that I've been drawing since grad school. From t-the gardens to the spiral staircase, to the open kitchen plan with the island, down to the baroque fireplace and the byzantine architecture. Can we at least make an offer on it? I know it's a long shot, but, please? Okay, fine. But, do you know how many people probably made offers today? I don't want you to get your hopes up. I won't. Thank you. -mr. Grant, hello. -Morning. -Renee! Hi. -Hi. -What are you doing here? -Um... I just came to tell you guys congrats! Your offer was accepted. I'm sorry, come again? The house, the-the maple estate, it's yours. Seriously? Would I come all the way here in this dress if I was joking? Um, yeah, so we do have a lot of paperwork to fill out. -So is this a good time? -Yeah, definitely. Wonderful. Do you guys have coffee? -Yes. -Yeah. guess this is happening. all right, wait, so what is this? It's from an interior designer. That's a convenient little coincidence. You think maybe she came by and saw the house? Yeah, probably. What, you think she's any good? I don't know. I mean, how many times can we get lucky in a day? I'm not sure, but I think we're gonna find out! Come on. morgan, your work is amazing. How long have you been doing interior design? Um, I don't know, when I was 18 I was helping my mom redesign a house she bought after leaving my father and, it was all kind of downhill from there. Well, it sounds like you made the best out of a bad situation. Only, leaving him was the best situation. My dad was a taker, and, a terrible father. But enough about me. Tell me about you. You said, you and your husband flip all these homes? Yeah, yeah, as of recently. I'm actually an architect. I freelance as a contractor. I did, you know, a couple of things here and there, but I'm still waiting for my big break to catapult into stardom. in due time. - And, your husband? - He's an entrepreneur. He owns a firm that does landscaping design, construction, that kinda thing. He's got a couple of places in the valley that we're working on and we just sold the big one last month. Well, you do have to be able to make a cash down payment on the maple estate. I, spoke to desi at rivera realty. She, gave me the dish, you know? I was looking at the house, too. It's exquisite. Right, that makes sense considering where I found your card. Had you made an offer on the house, if you don't mind me asking? No, I mean, I can't afford a place like that just yet. But I like to scout all the homes for sale, peek in the gate, leave my card. Well, I'm glad that you did. Your work is so impressive. Does that mean I have the job? Well, I still have to talk to my husband. But between you and me, I am sold. Well, I guess it's the best that I can ask for now. -hey. You packin' for me, too? -Yeah. Toilet paper and water. Isn't this fun? It's like packing for summer camp, but like a badass summer camp with a mini movie theater and an elevator. yeah, yeah, basically. Hey, I, I talked to bliss, I told her she should just come to the house tomorrow. I figured she doesn't have much to do at the carlson place. Great. I can task her with organizing our new office. And I'm sure she will love you for that. Hey, how did the-the meeting go with the designer? I absolutely love her. I did say that I needed to talk to you first, but that was only to throw you under the bus to negotiate a better rate. Perfect! Love it! And I also love when you say words like negotiate. - My goodness. - Get outta here. It's such a nice word when you say it. Morgan, hi! thank you for coming. Pretty cool? It's just... How am I ever gonna design a place like this? it'll take a lifetime. Is that how long we're payin' you for? morgan, this is my slightly-less sarcastic and far less funny husband, josh. That's me. Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, josh, and don't worry, I won't charge much interest. and this is bliss, she's staying in the west wing while we get things afloat. We've hired her full-time. She basically takes care of the property and manages estates and vendors and contractors. Cleans up messes after these two, mostly. And most days it feels more like entertainment than work, so... It's really nice to meet you, morgan. Nice to meet you. And you are so pretty. -Thank you. -You're welcome. So is anyone gonna give me the grand tour? Yeah, of course. What do you want to see? -Everything. -Everything it is. Get to it. Enjoy. so, where'd you guys find her? I think she just knew that the house was for sale and just kinda put her card in the mailbox. Nice. So bliss is staying in that room over there. And then over here we have two rooms. I was thinking of maybe turning this left one into a reading room. Funny, I thought the same. About the reading room? I thought you hadn't been here. I just meant I could see all the direct sunlight coming in and it made the most sense from a completely logistical point of view. I mean, who wouldn't want a darling reading room in their home? Yeah. No, of course, that makes sense. - I guess great minds? - Yeah. no, no, but-but really. I love all of your ideas so far. I mean, I think the modern rustic feel will give the place a homey feel that won't clash with the-- slightly tacky elegance. Took the words right out of my mouth. Yeah, this place is perfect. It just... It's a little touch of home. - Home is where the heart is. - Yeah. hello, edgar. What the hell are you doing here? I'm helping the new home owners with interior design. What are you still doing here? Realtor's kept me on for the time being. Am I supposed to believe you're here by coincidence? Please. It's been how long since I've seen you? Get over yourself. Do the new owners know who you are? edgar, stop. why would you do that? I'm sorry, officer. He came on to me, he ripped up my shirt! I am seconds away from screaming assault. and who do you think they'll believe? So why don't you... Go grab your crap out of the guesthouse and leave as quietly and as soon as possible? you're crazy, lady! I love this one. it's breathtaking, isn't it? -How much is it? -This one... I think is... -Four thousand. -Four thousand? I don't love it that much. look, it'll go great on the wall here. It'll be the first thing you see as soon as you enter. You do want to dress to impress, right? I mean, I think it's a tiny investment, really. We can try to squeeze it in the budget, no? Can we just sidebar on that for now? I really wanna see how much these spare rooms are gonna cost before committing to any big pieces. -Of course. -Hello, ladies. Speaking of sidebars... Hon, where'd you, put the towels? Found one. Hit me! - handsome! - touchdown! we crush that every time, let's do it. If y'all need me, I'll be out at the pool. Hey, I found an old manila folder under a drawer in the desk downstairs. Do you want me to hang on to it? Of course! It could be important. Sure, yeah. It might be important. -I'll look at it in a minute. -Okay. I'm sorry, I just know how much things like that could be worth in this house. No, you're right, and if it belongs to an era, then they should definitely have it. Right and, um, by the way, I hate to ask you this, but would you mind giving me an advance today? I mean, the first payment for the design job. Yeah. Of course, I'll just grab my checkbook. Thank you. Did you guys find a golden fortune? it was a joke about the mysterious folder you said you found. Um... Yeah, it just turned out to be some old medical documents of beverly's. Old prescriptions and things. No golden fortune, unfortunately. Bliss, is it? Would you mind helping me with the other end? Yeah, sure. Right. I'll stand over here. Perfect! I was thinking something plush, maybe beige. Yeah. Yeah, I like that. We should probably get josh's opinion first, though. This is more of his domain. I like to work at, like, the kitchen bar, the den. More of a nomad like that. Yeah, I kind of feel like josh is the kind of hubby that would do anything his wife asks of him in the end. You know? I mean... You do have great taste, obviously. I mean, but if you wanna ask him o-of course, of course, let's get the guy's take. But I think the powder room is off. For sure, the powder room is definitely off-limits to the male gender. Period. Well, I have some great ideas. You wanna show me? I'd love to. hey! Did you get the notice or what? You're never here when I stop by. Because I work during the day, ivan. Really? You have a job. That's funny, because you don't pay rent. There. I signed it over to you. -Happy now? -Okay. Great, so this is your rent for the last month and a half. What about the month and a half before? I've only done half the job. I'll give you the other half at the end of next month. Is that what this is about? Are you still pissed because I dumped you after I found out you lied about owning this place? Look... Let's make a deal. How about I pay you half now, the other half later with... We'll call it a promise-to-pay with a special perk. Perk? Take off your shirt. Come again? I said, take off your shirt and remind me of why I liked you in the first place. dear ivan, I'll be gone by the end of the month, but you won't cash that check. All three months I owe, you will cover. I have plenty more photos, too. There's your perk. Xo, morgan. do you need something? No, I was just, looking for a pen, actually. In a locked drawer? Anything else? edgar? Hey, edgar! no! My god! -Bliss, are you okay? -Was that a nail? I'm so sorry, I-I was just trying to figure it out. -I had no idea it was loaded. -Yeah. Well, maybe, next time take a peek inside and check, you think? -morning. -Morning. -What's up? -I'm not really sure. The, the gardener just kinda took off without sayin' anything to us. I came down to tell him about this leaky sink, and his stuff's just gone. - It's, strange. - Yeah. Well, maybe he got a better gig back in the city. Yeah, maybe, but still seems kinda strange, though. Know? Don't know how long he's gone for. That guy was a little creepy, anyway. yeah. Um, anyways, there are tons of great people out there who can garden, plumb and all that fun stuff. -Right? -Yeah. I'm sure we'll find you someone great. Yeah, I mean, we know a bunch of people, so it'll be fine. But, no designer? Well, I mean, jules was kinda thinkin' she would do all that, but a place this big, she figured we could use the help. Well, I'm flattered to be the chosen one. So, how long have you been an entrepreneur? Jules tells me you have your hands in a few different things. Yeah, um, probably since I graduated business school. - Same thing. Yeah. - And then, you know, life. Um, even my parents were, you know, able to kind of help me out a little bit. So-so that was good, they're not, you know, crazy or anything, but definitely helped. Well, you are lucky. You know, my mom, she got a good alimony out of her divorce, but, um, she still made me get a job working at this awful laundromat. It was probably the most demeaning experience of my life. My boss was such a pig. But, you know, it gave me a great work ethic and, I'm a self-made woman. Look at that. There you go. But, honestly, like, who needs a man, right? I mean, who needs those guys? They're trash. I can see why jules married you, though. I mean, you guys are... You're both so charming and have a great sense of humor. Thank you. Thanks. What about you, though? You seeing anyone or got, like, a boyfriend or... Unfortunately, no. But, um, I was very in love at one point, but, um, but he got really sick. And he's gone. Um, I'm so sorry. Thanks. Hey, love might find me again one day, you know? And, if not, a really great house would do. And that was how we met, but just don't tell him that first part. He'd kill me. Wow. I won't. Good to know, though. -Hey. -Hi. -Um, this our neighbor, perry. -Hey. -This is my husband, josh. -Nice to meet you. Hi. Our interior designer, morgan. Didn't even see you drive in. Sorry, I snuck through the gate on the western fence line. I mean, this place is so big, it would've taken me like ten minutes to go around. So... You guys want any coffee? I mean, look at this bread basket. I mean, does he know us or does he know us? I wish I made this myself, but I just spent a pretty penny at a local bakery which, trust me, is way better than my baking. well, we appreciate it either way, so thank you. - welcome. - What do you do, perry? Perry here is a divorce attorney. Don't get any bright ideas. Okay? Um, have we met before? I swear I've seen you somewhere. I mean, I don't think so. -Do you work on the west side? -Yeah. I went to many a happy hours with my boys there back in the day, so, maybe we crossed paths way back when. Yeah, I usually don't leave work until 8 p.M. But who knows, I'm sure there's a happy hour or two that got lost somewhere in the shuffle. Red rainbow bar is def an old favorite haunt of mine. Same. So tell me, what exactly do you plan to do with this place? I mean, clearly, it needs much work. Why don't you come with me and I'll show you? Nice. Definitely red rainbow bar. morgan, I picked up thai food. You wanna come down and eat? Morgan? Bliss, is that you? you scared me. Did you not hear me calling for you? No, I was just... I was, I was just getting some measurements, that's all. Well, I ordered some food if you're hungry. Are you okay? No, really, it's, it's nothing, really. Nothing that a big old glass of wine can't fix. Come on. I'm sorry, it's just, it's my landlord. You know, he's a bit of a creep. He lives next door, and we dated once or twice ages ago and now he always keeps coming around and harassing me. And, I told him to leave me alone and now he's trying to kick me out. That's awful. Should I come over and, I don't know, maybe we slash his tires together? yeah, no, I, I think I just need to get out of there as soon as possible, you know? I'm, I'm actually kind of afraid to sleep there at night. Last night he was banging on my door and he's been texting me all evening asking me where I'm at. Do you think you should call the cops? Yeah, see, the problem is he hasn't done anything physical and we did date, so, you know, it is what it is. Just... I need to tough it out until the end of the month and try and find something else. I mean, we have all these rooms here. You could just stay here. Um, no, I wouldn't wanna impose. No, I mean, you've been so wonderful and you already have ms. Bliss. Well, we have the guesthouse. I mean, the gardener's gone. You could probably stay down there until you figure it out. Really? You wouldn't mind? No, not at all. I-I mean, I have to ask josh first, but I'm sure it'll be fine. Jules, thank you! You're the best! Of course. You know, I'd be happy to have you here. I, I honestly don't have many girlfriends. I'd like that. Well, the... What about you and bliss? I thought for sure you two were besties. Well, I mean, bliss is, is great and everything. She's just more of a guy's girl.. What do you mean? Well, she was josh's friend before and all of our contractors who work for us adore her. I mean, she was like a competitive cheerleader and loves football and tequila shots. And I'm more of a homebody who's like "no" to all of that and like, "I'm just gonna sit here and sip my wine." What about, her and josh? - They never had anything? - No. Definitely not. I mean, not that I'm aware of. But I trust josh and bliss. Well, I love how secure you are in your marriage. I definitely wouldn't trust that gorgeous creature with my husband. yeah. yeah. I love it. yeah, well, okay, so I was thinking if I put this here... Ooh, I love it. -Right? -You're the best, you know that? No. But do you like it, though? - I do. - you hate it. - no, I don't. - you do. you all right? Yeah, I'm just tired. It's been a long day. So how was aspendale? You and bliss get everything done? Yeah, yeah, um, still gotta do the tiling in the downstairs bathroom. But I think everything else looks great. Good. so, morgan's been having some issues with her landlord and had to move out. So I told her she could stay in the guesthouse for the rest of the month. Well, like, like, move her stuff in? I mean, I don't know, maybe not all of it. -But, I guess, yeah. -I mean, honey... -We barely know this girl. -What are you talking about? She's here practically ten hours a day. And we have that big delivery coming, so I thought it might be nice to have some extra hands, right? I, I mean, I don't know, it's like when somebody moves their stuff into a place, that there's a certain permanence to that, you know? And I just, I'm saying, I don't want there to be drama. Well, you didn't blink an eye when you asked bliss to stay in the west wing. Okay, that is different. Right? Hey, bliss is like family. Yeah. To you. And ever since she's been here, you guys have been so close, just spending so much time together. I'm sorry, is there a conversation that we need to be having right now? 'cause I-I have no clue what's going on with you right now at all. No. No, no, it's, it's-it's fine. I'm just, I'm tired. Go to sleep. Okay. goodnight. -mornin'. -Good morning. Hey, um, did something, like, weird happen with you and jules yesterday? Um, no. Why? I don't know, she just, she seemed off. We got into it and it felt like she was jealous of us. you and me? Yeah. No, you don't think she suspects something 'cause we were out all day yesterday, you know? I don't know, I don't know. I-it doesn't make any sense. Okay, well, I-I'll talk to her, ease her mind. But she still has to get out of here today or else we're screwed. Yeah, I got that taken care of. I just need you to grab that stuff for me. I'm on it, text me if you think of anything else while we're out. -Yeah. Of course. -Morning. Good morning. Hey. I, made you some coffee. thanks. Remember we were talking about maybe getting renee a little gift for being so wonderful? I was thinking you could maybe pick something up, drop by with it as a thank you, if you have time? Yeah. Yeah, actually. Might be nice to get out of the house. And morgan's moving in right now, so there's not really much for me to do anyway. perfect. Would you mind helping her down at the guesthouse? It looked like she had a couple of boxes. -Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Yup. -Okay. Thanks. -I'm just gonna go change. -Okay. -I'll see you later? -Yeah. Your... Coffee. -Jules, hey! -Hi, desi. -Aren't those pretty? -Yeah, they're for ms. Rivera. - And we got each of you a card. - Thanks. Come. I think renee's in her office. Great. Fragrance. Yeah, do you think she'll like 'em? -Hi. -Hi. Lilies! My favorite. Really? No, but they are gorgeous and I love them, so thank you so much. -And thanks for the card. -Yeah, of course. To what do we owe the pleasure? It's just a small thank you for selling us my dream house. I hope you like a good spa day. Spa days are the only days I like. um, h-how is everything going? You making good use out of that elevator? Absolutely. Yeah, e-everything is great. Good. I'm-I'm glad to hear. Um, did you guys find the interior designer you guys were looking for? Yes. And she's absolutely amazing. Who is she? Maybe I know her. -Her name's morgan. -Morgan. - Morgan dyer. . Um... I, yeah, I'll have to look her up and make sure she's as good as you say she is. oops, sorry. Hey, I am starving. -Do you wanna go grab some food? -Actually, yeah. -Yeah, that sounds great. -Okay. Yay. Wow. You, really are moving in? yeah. And, um... I just wanted to thank you and jules again for being so hospitable. -It means a lot. -Yeah, well... I mean, jules has really liked the work you've done, so it's all good. Now that I'm all good and sweaty. Yeah, I know. I think I'm gonna go for a dip in the pool. Yeah, yeah. Go for it. Care to, join me for a swim? Um, no, you know, I got some stuff that I gotta do, but you have fun. Let me know if you change your mind. so she just, like, took off her top? Yeah. Yeah, just kinda yanked it off, but it wasn't flirtatious, really. But definitely not appropriate. Yeah. You know, she is probably the reason jules is feeling insecure, too. There's just something about her I don't trust. She just watches you. I'm gonna talk to jules about it. Okay, but maybe not tonight? -Fine. -Thank you. I'm gonna go get the stuff if you think it's safe. Yeah, no, jules is gonna grab some lunch with renee and then I'm having her swing by the outlet to pick me some stuff up, so we good. That lying, basic little bitch. thank you so much for lunch. -That was really sweet. -Of course. And if there's anything that you guys need, you call me, okay? Yes, I will, thank you. Mwah. You're welcome. -Bye. -Bye. Bye. Hey, can you get edgar on the phone for me immediately? -I wanna talk to him. -You got it. Did you get him? Went straight to voicemail. Left him a message on his cell to call you back as soon as possible. Okay. I'll try him on his landline, too. Thank you. edgar, hey. This is renee at the real estate office. I just wanted to talk to you real quick about the grant's, new interior designer. Jules told me her name is morgan dyer. Obviously, the first name gave me some pause, so I just... well, looks like we have moles all over the place now, don't we? Guess I'm gonna have to bury them. Josh? Bliss? hello? Guys? Hello? surprise! -What-- -happy early anniversary, babe. You guys are literally the worst. Happy anniversary, you guys. We have tapas and all of your favorite wines. So this is what you guys have been so secretive about. -Maybe. -Yeah. Why, did you think we are having an affair? 'cause, gross. No. -Perry! -Hey. Hi. It's so good that you came. Josh left a note on my doorstep, said you don't have nearly enough girlfriends, so I decided to make an appearance. Happy anniversary, you guys. I hear it's been five long years. -Five long, great years. -Yes. -Let's party. -We should party, you're right. morgan. Hi. Um, I didn't think you'd be dressed so formally. But you, you look really good. You look great. I see we drink the same poison, too. Yeah. -You mind? -Yeah. Yeah, of course. - Cheers. - Cheers. Down it goes. -excuse me. -Yeah. jules... I am so sorry. I thought josh meant this was a cocktail affair. No, not at all. You look amazing. Well, I am, I'm so embarrassed, but happy anniversary to you both. Thank you, yeah, I mean, if you'd mentioned something, I would've gone out and bought a new dress. well, I-I got you a little something. You didn't have to do that. -Um... -Thank you. I mean, honestly, it's a, a re-gift, so... I-I just found out so last second. It's-it's fine. Thank you, this is really sweet of you. She knew this wasn't formal, she dressed that way on purpose. I also found out she lied about her portfolio. -What? -Whole thing is a fake. Full of photos from magazines. Wait, really? That's so tacky. And kinda genius. -Are you gonna tell them? -Yes. I just gotta find out why first. Well, I'll tell you this much. I swear I have seen that woman somewhere before, and not at some happy hour. hello? Desi? Desi? - hey. - My god! Jesus! Don't you sneak up on me like that. Please. Why are you carrying that around? You almost got shanked with this. okay? You need anything else? I'm beat. No. No, I... I'm gonna head out, too, and try to catch the last of the grant's anniversary party and hope that the gay neighbor isn't the only cute single guy there. okay. Well, good luck. -And goodnight. -Thanks. Goodnight. hello. Can I help you? We're closed. I will call the police if you don't exit that door right now. Do you want my purse? Take it! No. No. Ned... Ned... Ned. Ned! Ned! ned, no. Please. you did good, grant. I don't know how you did it, but that was a really nice surprise. Well, I may have secretly texted renee and had her take you to lunch to buy us some time. And I had you go to the outlet. - Smooth. - Yeah. You also got a nice pair of underwear and socks from the whole thing. Yeah, pretty big win-win I was thinking. Look, um, I'm really sorry about acting so crazy. And you know I trust you. It's okay. But if I'm being honest, part of me kinda liked jealous jules. - you did? - Maybe a little bit. Okay. I can bring her back. You can, can you? Let me see... Here she is. you know... Tonight, this place kinda felt like home. I don't know about you, but I think we should stay here. Make it our forever home. You know what? I think that's a good idea. Yeah, so I think right here maybe move the tiles over to the side. -Morning. -Morgan. Hi. What happened to you last night? You disappeared from the party. Yeah, sorry, I, felt a bit overdressed, so I went back and I changed, came back for a bit and started talking to people in the den and, I, I didn't see you guys again. It's too bad. You missed dessert. Well, maybe next time. So, um, what's going on here? Well, I decided I wanted to turn this into my work room instead of the reading room, and I figured that everything we ordered can just fit around my work table. Sure. I mean, I imagine so. You know, I'm sure it will transition back perfectly into a reading room once you guys are finished and ready to put it up for sale again. Didn't you hear? They're not selling the house anymore. They're staying. Isn't that great? but I thought we were designing this home in such a way to maximize the sale. We were, but josh and I talked last night and we decided that we wanna keep it. Make it our forever home. You know, the one that we die in. Jules, um, I've fallen in love with this home, too. I was hoping to make you guys an offer on it. With what money? I have an inheritance coming to me soon. And, frankly, I don't see how this is any of your concern whatsoever. Okay, morgan, I'm-I'm really sorry, but I had no idea that this is what you were planning on. I thought you were blueprinting the home of your dreams. I mean, th-that's what you told me two weeks ago when you hired me. And she's allowed to change her mind. It's their house, remember? And what are your real credentials anyways? Because a-as far as I can tell, your portfolio's nothing but a bunch of cut-outs from design magazines. So a-are they even yours? -Wait, wait, wait. What? -Of course they're mine. And are you so stupid to think I can't have my work published in a magazine? I am not so stupid to assume that you'd use real photos for your portfolio, so... Well, tell us. Why don't you? I refuse to entertain your husband's lap dog. We can finish this conversation again later, in private. hey... You okay? I'm sorry. I just got into this dumb argument with bliss and I'm so embarrassed for letting jules see me this way. I feel like such a fool. I-I mean, well, look, jules is a very rational person. So whatever it is, I'm sure she'll understand. I hope so. - May I? - Please, yeah. You know, it was really sweet what you did last night for jules. Well, thank you. Um... Yeah, no, I mean, she's great, so... -She deserves it. -Yeah. You know, it would've been my one-year anniversary with my fiance last month, too. But, sadly, he died a little over a year ago. I'm, I'm so sorry. I... -I had no idea. -Not many people knew. You know, seeing you and jules together, so happy, it... It was really great, you know? Gives me hope. it's okay. Um... morgan! The hell is wrong with you? W-well, you came on to me! You touched the small of my back! No! No, I didn't at all. What-what are you talking? You tried to kiss me! I saw you! I-I don't know what's happening right now, but that was so inappropriate, okay? And-and you need to leave now. Now. Please. so what are we gonna do, then? You can her ass immediately and tell her to move out right now. - Of course. - Bliss is right. She's unstable, it's only gonna get worse if we try and reason with her. You can't reason with the unreasonable. But what if she accuses you of something? They take that kind of thing very seriously in the workplace these days. I will testify to his character, so will any other women that we work with, and she will look like the desperate, crazy, cradle-robber that she is. I just, I ju... I wish we knew what she was after. -Like, what, is it our money? -It's not our money. it's the house. It has to be. Good job, jules. And you're right. That house will be mine. -are you okay? -Fell off the ladder. Ay? -No, please don't! I can't move my neck.! - My god, what happened? - I can't move my neck! Yeah, honey, honey, just let-let her do it. - are you okay? - No! I'm not okay! I was trying to hang that painting and I fell and hurt my neck, my arm really bad because of your stupid, broken ladder! Okay. Let me see. What? You don't believe me? I mean, I think that ladder looks fine. Whether it is or it isn't, that isn't the point! The point is, I fell! And I fell on the job, working for you! Okay, you know what? Then, um... You don't work for us anymore. You're fired. How about that? That doesn't change the fact that I fell before you fired me, now, does it? you gotta be kiddin' me, lady. Is she serious right now? When you have to testify in court as a witness to my accident, you will see how serious I am. Are you, are you serious right now? Court? Morgan, don't you think you're overreacting like, a little bit? Okay, yeah, that's fine. Take the picture, that's-that's good. She's full of it, josh. And she's bluffin'. Just kick her out already. She's not bluffing. Are you, morgan? You want us out of our house so you can have it all to yourself, even after everything that we've done for you. Given you a job, let you live here. And you're willing to do anything to make that happen? You know, you're a lot smarter than I initially gave you credit for, jules. If you think that we're just gonna give this place up without a fight, you're a lot dumber than I gave you credit for. So listen very carefully. In case you missed what josh said the first time around, you are fired! So get the hell out of my house, off of our property and away from my husband before you have a real fall. I hope you have a good lawyer. I mean, look, I'm not the best with property law, but I have some friends who are. I can make some calls for you first thing tomorrow. Do you guys have workmans' comp or anything for your contractors? We have an insurance policy, but... -Morgan's not on it. -Yeah. So we're screwed, right? It's a really slippery slope here. I mean, she claims she was hanging a painting, right? Technically, that's not in her job description, is it? So you could have an argument that she came into the house before regular work hours and of her own volition and was doing things not asked by you. and what are we gonna do about her tonight? Because I hate the idea that she's still lurking around down there. we could call the cops and have her removed from the property immediately if you like. Yes. Yes, we would like very much. Okay, yeah, I, I can call the police and see if they'll send a deputy over right now. Josh, wait. Why don't we go down there and show her that we're serious? Okay, all right, but I wanna go out there first and see if I can get her out of the guesthouse. Okay. -Yeah? -Okay. what happened with that gardener? No clue, one morning I came to check on him because the garden was looking sad, and all of his stuff was gone. And we figured that he had gotten a better gig. Well, considering the current circumstances and who's staying here now, you're so sure about that? All right, you guys stay here. I'm gonna check, okay? Okay. morgan? - I wonder where she went. - you know... I still swear I've seen her somewhere before. I'll have to see if my friend at the station can do some digging into her records, figure out where I know her from. Well, thank you for all your help. It's my pleasure. You guys get some rest tonight, okay? I'll be in touch first thing tomorrow after I talk to a few of my colleagues. Thank you so much. We really appreciate it. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. Goodnight. Well, thank goodness she left? Yeah. nothin' here. yeah, here either. Now what? We must be missing something. I mean, there has to be a reason that she wants this house so badly. are you sure she didn't just start designing and, like, get obsessed? Well, just because she's obsessed with your husband and wants your life. No. No, it's, it's something else. I think she has history here. go, go, go, go. -Jules, where are you going? -Where's that folder? The one you mentioned was left in the house? It's downstairs in the study. I locked it in one of those drawers. Wait, wait, what folder? There was a folder left behind by ms. Maples. It just had medical records and stuff in it. We looked through that already. But that was when we were looking for something different. okay, so, what is it we're looking for exactly? This. Looks like a, an emergency contact? Yup. hi, this is florence. I can't come to the phone right now... She's not answering, but she lives in woodland hills. That's like, what, 30 minutes away? Yeah, if she still lives there. Only one way to find out. -I'm gonna grab my purse. -I'll call perry. -Hi. -Hi. Are you florence daly? Yes, I'm florence. May I help you? Yes, I'm jules grant. -This is my husband, josh. -Hi. We were just wondering if we could ask you a few questions about beverly maples. -You knew her? -Yes, I knew beverly. How do you two know beverly? Well, we didn't, but we, we bought the maples estate after beverly passed, so... That's lovely... - Would you like to come in? - please. Yes. Thanks. Would you guys like something to drink? No, we're fine. Thank you. So how is the estate? God, I sure do miss it sometimes. God, I worked for don and beverly for about six years until mr. Maples passed away. wait, you worked for them? Yes, I was their housekeeper. Ms. Maples had you listed as an emergency contact on an old document that we found. Did the maples not have any family? I believe don has a sister in kansas, but they didn't speak, as I recall. Um, and, when he passed away, he left everything to beverly, of course, and she didn't have any family. You know, I don't think they ever wanted kids. Were there any other employees who were working at the house? There was the gardener, edgar, um, but he was fairly new when I left. And I don't think beverly ever replaced me. I think she started taking care of the house herself and whatever she couldn't do, edgar could. Ms. Daly, did you know anybody with the name morgan? Um, might've been a friend of the family or somebody from the family who owned the house beforehand? Morgan, I, The name sounds awfully familiar. But the maples had a lot of friends. And they were always having get-togethers and barbeques and events at the estate. Um, they loved hosting. But, no, no one lived in the house before them. They built that house. This is morgan. Do you recognize her? Yes. Yeah... I can't believe I didn't remember her name after all these years. How do you two know morgan? We hired her as our interior designer. Interior designer? She's no interior designer. She's an executive assistant. She was don's assistant at the firm. Before don got sick, he was having an affair with her. She was at the house all the time when beverly wasn't there. And when beverly found out, morgan nearly went crazy. She kept showing up, and even after don let her go, she kept demanding to speak to him. she even called beverly and threatened her over the phone once. It was quite awful. is there anything else that you can tell us? The only reason I ask is, we've been having some trouble with her, too. We think she might want the house for herself. no, nothing that I can remember. -Thank you again for your time. -Of course. You two should be careful around her. She's not right in the head. yes, I understand. I do apologize, but ms. Rivera's out of town for a family emergency, unfortunately. No, but I could leave a message. Um, okay, then. Have a great weekend. Where are you, renee? hello? Renee, is that you? I think we should put a latch and a deadbolt on the guesthouse so she can't get back in till we figure this whole thing out. -What do you think? -It's not a bad idea. Let's do it. I'm gonna run out to the garage and grab that tool box. I'm gonna lock the door behind me, okay? -Watch your back. -All right. I'll be back in a few. bliss, do not sneak up on me like that. Sorry. How'd it go? - You don't wanna know. - Yes, I do. Let's see. josh isn't back yet, is he? If he has, I didn't see him come in. Where did I put my phone? it's pitch black down there. If he was putting up a lock, he'd need light. I'm calling the cops. wait, I see headlights. -It's perry. -Bliss, wait! guys, I finally remembered where I met morgan before. It was here at this house when the maples lived here. Wha-what's with the weaponry? Josh, he went down to the guesthouse and he never came back. -Josh! -Josh! - Josh! Josh! - josh! - josh! - josh! I think we need to call the cops. Yeah. - Perry, behind you! - morgan... Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing? Morgan, put down the hammer, you don't have to do this. Stop it, morg... freeze! Don't move, or I'll shoot. Put your weapons to the ground, slowly. Jules, cell phone. Slide it over. Morgan, morgan! You don't have to do this. You can have the house, okay? It-it-it is yours! Just please, please tell me where josh is. You'll find out soon enough. -What do you want with us? -What do I want with you? It is gonna be the affair of the century! Hot blonde, bliss leary, gets caught bangin' boss, josh! wifey jules goes wild! Ends up bashing hubby's head in with a hammer. Then kills anxious neighbor before strangling ms. Bliss to her untimely death! You will never get away with it. Too many people know about you already. Perry's co-workers have all heard your name and already know how crazy you are! On the contrary, I was never here. I have an air-tight alibi with my old landlord. He'll do anything for me and I do anything. He's not dead. No, no, he's-he's not dead. -He can't be, he can't be dead. -Come on, jules. She won't shoot us. She can't shoot us! Or else, the gun will be traced back to her. you wanna try me? Go to hell. Come on, jules. it is okay. It is okay. Okay, we're gonna get my phone and we're gonna call the police, okay? -Okay. -Okay. bliss! I have to go to him. Then go, I'll call the cops and I'll come find you as soon as I can. Okay. josh! josh! Josh! My god. My god. Josh! No, no, no, no, no, no. No. my... Josh! My god! You're alive. That bitch somehow got in here and took my phone. baby? God! Baby, baby, baby. Baby? josh? are you okay? Careful, don't to... Don't touch it, don't touch it. Don't touch it. My head! My head's killing me. It's morgan, she, she lost it, and she, she attacked perry and then, and then sh-sh-she killed renee! What? She killed renee? What are you talking about? - Yeah. God. - Are you okay? I think, I think he might be dead. I mean, dead or somethin'. God! -You think you can get up? -Yeah, yeah. Okay. -Okay. -Okay, so... I don't know where morgan is, but bliss is still in the house. -Okay? -Where's morgan? -I don't know, I don't know. -You don't know? Okay. -Bliss is in the house there. -Okay. -All right, let's go get her. -Okay. Okay. I think perry just moved. come on. perry. Perry! Hey, buddy. -can you get him in the car? -Yeah, yeah. Go, go, go. -I got it, I got it. -Okay. I'm gonna get bliss. Hey, buddy. Hey, I'm gonna pick you up, okay? Here we go. Up, up. Nice and easy. Here we go, here we go. Bliss? bliss? why the screams, jules? -You did this. -Stay back. Put the poker down or I'll shoot, and trust me, I'm no longer afraid to use this. Put it down. Okay. doesn't look like this is gonna be your forever home. but you know what? I guess you were right about one thing. This is gonna be the home you die in. Just like poor old ms. Maples' death. stop, or I'll shoot! He was gonna leave this house to me when he died. I loved him! Then he left everything to his selfish wife. And now you're trying to take what's mine! It's not yours, morgan. 1128 maple drive is ours. there you are. Why, thank you very much. Are you, not drinkin'? -No. Not today. -Okay. So, I've been doing some thinking and maybe we can turn bliss' old room into, a nursery. I think she really would have liked that. I mean, I would do the designs myself, of course. Wait, are, are you... baby! I'm so sorry! Mwah! I'm sorry. Daddy's sorry. He's excited. I am, too. I think our family is gonna be really happy here.
