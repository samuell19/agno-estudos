I look forward to getting to know each and every one of you. (WHISPERING) Peter. Recess is coming. (SCHOOL BELL RINGS) Okay... Oh! Hi. Um... Peter. (SIGHS) You're supposed to be at recess. I don't like recess. You don't want to play with your friends? Okay. You can stay here. Yeah, you can help me with the decorations. I love Halloween. Do you know what you're going as? Well, you have plenty of time to figure it out. (PETER GASPING) Look, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Here. Um... Yeah, and take this and slide it under, okay? It's okay. (SHUDDERS) Yeah. There you go. Like that. Pick it up. We're gonna take this to the window. (STUDENTS PLAYING) Um... What am I gonna be for Halloween? I want to dress up. I want to trick-or-treat. All the other kids at school get to do it. And we're not their parents. (SMACKS LIPS) Hey, Pete. (CLEARS THROAT) You know the old house down the end of the lane, with the boarded windows? He's going to find out eventually. (WHISPERS) Carol. PETER: What? Well, a few years ago, before you were born, the little girl that lived there, she vanished on Halloween. PETER: What happened? MARK: Well, nobody knows. She went out trick-or-treating and she disappeared. (CAROL SHUDDERS) It was a very traumatic event. For everybody in the neighborhood. And I, personally, don't like remembering it. Am I gonna disappear? CAROL: Oh, Peter. Of course not, honey. No. We would never let that happen to you. Ever. Okay?

(SHUDDERS) Okay. (SIGHS) You know what? I bet it's rats. But I've got something that'll take care of that. Rats? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) It smells like cinnamon. Well, be careful. Not everything is as sweet as it seems. PETER: They eat it? MARK: That's the idea. Then what? Well... (IMITATES THROAT-SLIT) (CHUCKLES) Pete, we can't have rats. They bite. They... They spread disease. Not to mention, keep you up all hours of the night. Mm-hmm? I guess. (SIGHS) Look. (SIGHS) Sometimes, you have to make tough decisions to protect your family. You understand?

Yeah, I just wanted to come over and... and check on him personally. Hmm. I was a teacher myself. That was before I... I became a mother. Is he all right? Peter? Yes. Um... (CHUCKLES) I... I did want to show you something. What's this? The children were drawing for Halloween. Peter painted this? Yes. Yes. The other children drew monsters and witches, but Peter... I see. Huh. Well, this is embarrassing. You see, Peter has an overactive imagination. (TUTS) He still wakes his father and I up in the middle of the night with all of his little flights of fancy which, uh, which is all this picture is. I do appreciate your concern though. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR LOCKING) What is this? A drawing. A drawing of what? A drawing of what? This is your room, Peter. Why are you asking for help? I'm not. Why are you asking strangers for help, Peter? (FIRMLY) I'm not. (SOFTLY) She is. What was that? It's just a scary drawing, Mom. Oh, that imagination of yours, Peter. It's going to get you into trouble one day. (UNEASY MUSIC PLAYING) (MUFFLED KNOCK) THE GIRL: (WHISPERING) Wake up, Peter. (LOUD KNOCKING) Peter. Don't be scared. I just want to talk.

(MUFFLED FOOTSTEPS) PETER: Wait, don't go. I'm sorry. Please stay. THE GIRL: Are you sure? PETER: Yes, we can talk. MISS DEVINE: Peter, this is great. What's his name? Hector. Of course.

(DARK MUSIC PLAYING) GIRL: Busted. (STUDENTS LAUGHING) I'm sorry, Peter. (STUDENTS LAUGHING) That was very nice of Brian, wasn't it, Peter? THE GIRL: Show him you're not afraid anymore.

Peter has never done anything like this before! He doesn't have a violent bone in his body! It was an accident. I'm sure of it. MARK: Expelled? Do you have anything to say for yourself, Peter? Peter? I didn't mean for him to fall down the stairs. For God's sakes. We are not a family that solves our problems with violence, Peter. Ever. I don't understand where this kind of behavior comes from! Peter drew a picture. For school. What? I'm sorry. I know that I should have told you earlier. But I... Hold on, hold on. What kind of picture? What kind of picture, Carol? CAROL: A child. A child asking for help. What? I knew that you would jump to conclusions. You're only telling me this now? And it's just not possible. MARK: Okay, stop. Even when I tell you about... MARK: Stop. Peter. Why would you draw a picture like that? (BREATHES SHAKILY) (SHOUTS) Peter! Because I really heard her! No, you did not! No! (MARK BREATHES DEEPLY) You're grounded. Okay, Peter. Go to your room. No, no, no! Carol, he's grounded. He's going in the basement. Now. (CREAKING) (MARK SIGHS) (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) Stand up. I said, stand up. MARK: Get up.

I wanted to make sure that Peter was okay. (SAD MUSIC PLAYING) PRINCIPAL: Is he showing up with bruises? No, not that I can see. Does he wet himself? Is he talking about sex or other things a boy his age shouldn't know about? No. Then, unfortunately, there's nothing we can do. There are a lot of Peters. Delicate little kids you want to protect from life's cruelties, but you can't get personally invested. You'll be eaten alive. (SIGHS) You've met his parents? His mother, there's something... off about her. PRINCIPAL: There's a child that disappeared from their neighborhood years ago. (GRUNTS) Something like that would make any parent overprotective. (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (WASHING MACHINE WHIRRING) (DOORBELL RINGS) (KEYS JINGLE) Hello. Hi. I have Peter's last math quiz. I thought you should have it.

That's wonderful. We can hang it on the fridge. (CHUCKLES DRYLY) Please, come in. We just made coffee. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) MARK: (MUFFLED) This way. (DOOR LOCKING) Have a seat. Thanks. (DRINK POURING) (STOPS WHIRRING) Here you go. MISS DEVINE: You're bleeding. Oh, I'm just doing some remodeling. Loose nail. Don't worry about it. (CHUCKLES) Uh, well, since I'm here, I just want to express how sorry I am about what happened. Aw. That's very, very sweet of you. But honestly, no apology necessary. Peter is a spirited boy. Uh, do you have any idea where Peter will be going to school? Of course, we do. Here. At home. Oh. Carol is the best teacher Peter could ever have. What? You don't think that's a good idea? Uh... I just think that, um, (SMACKS LIPS) given his behavior, he might benefit from an environment more suited toward his needs? (CHUCKLES) No, we're not going to give our son away. Thank you. No. No. No. No, we're not. Family is what he needs. (MUFFLED) Family's what he's gonna get. Where is he? He's grounded. In his room. May I see him? No, you may not. I don't think it's appropriate. I would just like to say goodbye. What is your interest in our son? You're no longer his teacher. So, I... I don't... It's very strange to me that you continue to show up at our house. I just wanted to make sure he was all right. I'm sorry, "that he was all right"? You think that Peter's in danger? Do you think that I'm the kind of mother that would harm my child? Okay. Honey. It's okay. CAROL: I love Peter. We love Peter. We love Peter. With every fiber of our being. You don't know anything about... Hey. Hey, enough. No. No. Before... How dare you? How dare you come into our home... MARK: Honey, honey, honey. Carol. Carol. Stop. CAROL: ...for you to tell us what's best for our son. MARK: She doesn't... Listen to me. (WHIRRING LOUDLY) What mother gives up on her child? Sweetheart, that's enough. CAROL: The audacity of this woman! This stranger. (KNOCKS) You don't know anything. MARK: Don't let the opinion of a stranger upset you. (MUFFLED KNOCKING) Enough. Hey. Enough. CAROL: No, before I had Peter, the doctor said... ...Peter's a miracle... Help! CAROL: ...and I would never give up on him. I would never give him away. Never. Peter's a miracle. An institute, for what? Help! Excuse me. I think you better leave. I'm sorry. This was a mistake. (CONTINUES WHIRRING LOUDLY) (STOPS WHIRRING) (THUDDING) What is that? What? The noise. The banging. The washing machine. (MACHINE CLICKS) (WHIRRING) Please.

You won't be going back to school any longer. I'm gonna be your teacher now. MARK: That's right. Your mom here, she's going to teach you the three R's, Pete. You know what they are? Readin', Writin', and Arithmetic. (LAUGHING) Oh... Okay, I'm sorry. You're a good boy, Peter. Oh, and we love you. And we forgive you. Love you too.

You wouldn't like the looks of me. You'll scream and get us caught. No, I won't. I promise. Okay. There's a hole behind the wallpaper. Do you see it? (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) (BALL CLATTERS) (UNSETTLING MUSIC PLAYING) (GASPS) (BREATHES RAPIDLY) (NERVOUSLY) Who are you? I'm your sister. Hmm? I've been waiting, Peter. I had to wait till you were big enough. Big enough for what? THE GIRL: Big enough to move the clock that hides the door. Big enough to help me escape. To leave the dark. To leave the wall. (NERVOUSLY) Please stop. No, you're scaring me. THE GIRL: You need to be scared. Mom and Dad, they're evil, Peter. Now you know. Your time is coming.

What was it about? I... I don't remember. Well, it can't hurt you now. PETER: (WHISPERING) If they keep you in their room, then how are you talking to me? THE GIRL: I escaped. I scratched and clawed my way to you. Mom and Dad? They hate me, Peter. Once they've had enough of me, I'm finished. They'll kill me. And they'll put you in the wall. No. They wouldn't do that. They wouldn't kill anybody. No, Peter. They already have. You need to see what's buried in the garden. I'll tell you where. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (CLACK) (SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING) CAROL: Peter. (INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING) Peter. What are you doing? (MUSIC QUIETS) I was thinking that, um, I know I can't go trick-or-treating, but maybe we could carve a pumpkin. THE GIRL: It was Halloween. Before they locked me in the wall. (PUMPKIN SQUELCHING) A trick-or-treater came to the door. I asked her for help. (WHIMPERS) And she saw me. They killed her, Peter. (SNIFFLES) I don't want to end up like that girl. I'm getting you out of there. I'm gonna get you out of there and then, then we're gonna run away. We're gonna be a family. A real one. But how?

I think Peter just tried to call me. He did, indeed. Peter was just telling me how dearly he misses his teacher, and so I said, "Peter, just give her a ring. "Tell her yourself." But unfortunately, his shy streak seems to have gotten the best of him. He's like a little blushing bride over here. It's so cute. (CHUCKLING) Well, better luck next time, I suppose. So sorry to have bothered you. Have a happy Halloween. (SLAMS RECEIVER) (UNNERVING MUSIC PLAYING) That was bad, Peter. I'm sorry. You did a very bad thing. (GASPS) You called a stranger? She doesn't know best for you. She doesn't love you the way your father and I do. I am so disappointed in you. What is that? It's nothing! (SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING) (PETER SHUDDERING) No. No... No, no. No. No. (BREATHING RAGGEDLY) No. (BREATHING SHAKILY) (WHIMPERS) What... What did she tell you? (SHOUTS) What did she tell you? (CLOCK TOLLING) (GASPS) It doesn't matter. Whatever.
