You Tube - Video Running Time 02:27:19 You Tube search name - Andaz I rode the horse for two days, at your insistence. - My whole body aches. - Just once more today too. Are you mad? I intend to sleep till 10 o'clock today. I don't enjoy it alone. This too will be sorted out soon. - I'm leaving. - There you go! What did you say? Neena fell of the horse? Where are you calling from? I'll be there right away. Hey! I'm a doctor! I'm not a horse! Where's my horse? - Here I am! - You? A horse? Whether you call me a horse or a laborer... I was the one who brought you here. So, you're waiting here to collect your wages? If there's a price for saving a life, give it to me. Hold on! Let me see if you have delivered my limbs safely or not. Your arms, legs, nose, elbows, knees are all in order. If you don't believe me, ask the doctor. Your good deeds have come in handy today. This is why I've always discouraged you from riding a horse. - How are you, dear? - I'm fine, Daddy. Let's go home now. Thanks a lot, doctor. - You're taking her at your own risk. - Don't worry. - Why don't you wear it? - No, I'm fine. Mr. Horse... thank you very much. - Horse? - That's the title she gave me. - My name is Dilip. - He saved my life, Daddy. Thanks a lot, Mr. Dilip. - Do make sure you visit us. - Sure, I will. After all... - I've to collect my dues. - I'll remember. - Bye. - Bye. Why did you take the trouble of bringing this? Don't you like it? You haven't told me where you're from. Any place but Shikarpur. Tell me. Actually, I'm from Africa. Believe me, I'm really from Africa. My father has a business there. You might now want to know why I don't resemble a gorilla. I have lost my heart somewhere today You might say I have given it to someone Every moment someone started coming near me Began telling me the secrets of this sudden excitement Our eyes clashed with each other It was like a poem for hearts Someone is in my eyes but... who is it? No one knows Is this the home of that someone? With mischievious eyes and a different style I sank the ship of my heart You might say I belong to someone now You sing so well. I wish I could go on listening to you. Thank you. But don't look upon me as a singer. So when will we meet again? Of the 365 days in a year, we spend at least half here. We will meet some time. Some time? There's the element of waiting in this 'some time'. The person who waits knows how enjoyable it is to wait. You too wait? - I hope you aren't hurt. - What's the point in asking now? Whatever had to happen has happened. The two of you have met in an interesting way. She's Sheela, my girlfriend. And he's Mr. Dilip. He saved my life. It's good that he saved your life. But why did he try to kill me? - It's so agonizing! - Stop your pretension. Otherwise I'll injure your other leg too. - He plays so well! - He's amazing! He's so good at playing games, in horse-riding and singing. - He's very handsome too! - You know better! What've you been talking about? - We're preparing to target you. - To target me? You're most welcome. I didn't hear you playing the piano. - You're being stylish now! - Now you are... - Would she not be going home? - It appears to be so. - Wouldn't you be going home? - Not till I listen to the piano. - Can you sing? - Yes. - Will you sing? - All right. Then I will play the piano too. - I am leaving. - Stop! You've to sing first. - Come on. - Come on. Don't be afraid to love someone Fill your life with love. This life is too short You decide to either live your life or just exist Nothing remains constant in life, seize the moments of love Life is summed up in two words, 'love' and 'youth' Always keep this in mind The world is a bed of thorns where love is like a beautiful garden Listen to the voice of your heart. Don't worry about the consequences Just go through this phase as well If you don't listen to me you may regret it. Make your choices now, it's your love, and opposing you is the world Laugh and sigh in love Don't be afraid to love someone - Master is calling you. - All right. Don't let him go. I'll be right back. Instead, you could clip my wings and put me inside a cage. What is it, Daddy? Here's the list of guests to be invited to your birthday party. It's surprising that Dilip's name isn't on the list. I was sure you'd mention it. Invite him if you wish. But you don't seem to be happy about inviting him. I didn't think it's appropriate. After all, he saved my life. Give him as much money as you like in return. Or offer him a job. In your opinion, can these things compensate for my life? I don't think so. Moreover, he wants neither a job nor your money. There are some things which can't be learned from books... nor do college professors teach about it. One learns it by experience. And it will be some time before you get some experience. You're talking in such an old-fashioned manner. If you continue to think along such lines... society won't allow you to survive. You'll fall from the horse every now and then... and every time a new person will be obliging you. Know what the outcome will be? This home will become a full-fledged zoo... where everybody will speak in their language... and you won't be able to understand any of them. When I'm no more, you will remember my words. I wonder why I don't like so much freedom. Possibly because I'm old-fashioned. Like you just said. Invite him. She's Shantadevi. She was like a sister to your mother. - Greetings. - Bless you. But she's not to be seen ever since your mother passed away. Greetings, Aunty. Bless you. Come, sit by my side. You're coming now! - Are you lost or something? - Let me regain my senses! What an exciting dress! You should also praise the one who's wearing it. You understand things a bit late. I meant just that! You talk in roundabout ways. I think your sense of understanding things is round-about. - May I say something? - Go ahead. Something is amiss in your dress. If you permit, may I fill the void? You're most welcome. You're putting the flower on her. But my heart is filled with fragrance. Watch out! Or you may faint! On this joyous occasion, you will have to take some trouble. Most gladly. Sheela is ready to dance, and the guests want to hear you sing. Who can refuse you today? But there's one condition. - Yes? - You'll remain by my side. I promise to sing a song people will remember all their lives. You don't even respond to me now! As if you care for me. I'll surely ask you today what exactly is on your mind? It's better you don't ask. Then should I assume that my daddy is angry at me? Come here, will you? - Come, let's have breakfast. - No, I don't feel like it. - Are you upset? - Why do you hide things from me? - Want my frank opinion? - Yes. I don't like your meeting Dilip so uninhibitedly. Everybody felt the same way at the party yesterday. And I know how embarrassed I was. Why worry about what others think? Who can understand me better than you? Moreover, you always said you didn't care what others said. When it comes to oneself, I can feel how vulnerable I am. Does it mean you no longer trust your Neena? After my hard work of 19 years, don't misunderstand me now. I know that you're naive. You can never have a bad feeling. But meeting a stranger like this... can surely give a wrong impression, both to him and to society at large. Let me tell you something today. It's possible that I may be too young to say this. Your daughter'll never do anything to cause you embarrassment. Let's have breakfast now. There's surely going to be some commotion at Sheela's birthday today. - Commotion? - Yes. Everybody is staring at you. They don't realize, if there's lightning they'll all be blinded. They know it too well. Lightning has already struck. But don't you be under any false impression. If you leave, there will be silence here. Do I play drums here? Your senseless talk, your unmelodious songs... from whom would I hear them then? If that's so, then I won't go. - But there's a condition. - What's the condition? What is that condition? - Shall I speak up? - Go ahead. - Shall I speak? - Go ahead. How can I speak in her presence? He's going to Africa. Really? Somebody might fall dead. Before dying, why don't you dance with him once? Come on. One repents before dying. One doesn't dance. - Your daddy hasn't come yet? - I wonder what's wrong. He told me to go ahead and he'd follow. You mentioned dancing with Sheela, didn't you? - How about a dance, Uncle? - Of course. - A telephone for you. - All right. Excuse me, Uncle. I'll be right back. - What were you hiding from me? - You'll be envious if you hear. Why would I feel envious? It had something to do with the heart. - With Neena? - Yes. There's no place for you in her heart. Didn't I say you'd feel envious? If you don't believe me, ask her yourself. Is that so? Sheela is a liar! Know what she says? Daddy has had a heart attack. I'm going home. I'll escort you home. What's happened to my dad? Why don't you speak? Why're you all around my dad? Go away! Drink this, Neena. Drink it on your own, Neena. Doctor, my name's Dilip. It has been two days now. She's neither eaten nor slept. I cannot bear seeing her stiff and with dry eyes, doctor. I know her silence is very dangerous. It's better if she weeps uncontrollably. But I don't know when and how she will weep. He's your Daddy, Neena. One whom you love very much. Without whom you cannot live even for a moment. He has gone far away from you. You'll never be able to see him again. Never again. Weep, Neena! Weep! You've lost his protection! Weep, Neena! - Weep, Neena! - No! I have summoned you all for something very important. You know that father made crucial decisions sitting in this chair. He used to run such a huge business empire with your support. He has left us suddenly. Now our sorrowful hearts are left with only memories of him. To immortalize him... I want to build a large hospital named after him... which would offer free treatment and accommodations for the ailing. On behalf of the entire staff, I assure you once again... that it will be our foremost duty to execute all your orders. My father has left assets and properties worth millions. On the other hand, another person has given me a new lease of life. That person is Mr. Dilip, my best friend. I request him to sit in this chair, and handle the business... and consider himself to be an equal partner along with me. I hope you will all abide by my decision... and help him in running the business. I offer you my congratulations on behalf of all of us. Why did you do this? I'm prepared to fulfill all your desires. But I don't want your wealth. Perhaps you forgot that you once said... that if there is any, you would accept compensation for saving life. And I had said that I wouldn't forget. - I was only joking with you. - It's possible. But what I've done is not a joke. I've done it with a lot of thought. Aren't you happy about my being happy about it? This is a blueprint of the proposed hospital. You're sure to like it. The lower portion will be for poor people, laborers and beggars. The upper floors are designed on the lines of America's biggest hospital. These special rooms will be meant for affluent people. Why? Do affluent people suffer from special diseases? This hospital is not being made so that affluent people... could consider it as a resthouse and relax for free. The hospital is being built to alleviate the sufferings... and diseases of the poor people and laborers. Yes, yes. I will come right away. Someone has brought happiness to my heart My heart was dark. He brought in the light of love My heart is full of anticipation and the desires have awakened now He gave my love a new life The one who had brought pain to my heart... now has brought laughter to my lips Someone has brought happiness to my heart My heart was dark. He brought in the light of love You seem to be well-equipped to overpower someone. You took very long. I had been waiting for you. Am I dreaming? I've seen you smile again after a long time today. You should ask why I am feeling so happy today. I don't have to ask you. I can see my good fortune smiling through your smile. Rather, say that my fortune has smiled today after a long time. In that case, there will be a shower of flowers from the sky... and both of us will sing songs of happiness... and we will fly in the skies to meet the moon. The moon will come down on the earth to meet us. Let's go. Look at your face! Are you back from London or from some jail? The thing is, without you, the whole world is a jail for me. I'm very glad to meet you, Mr. Dilip. I've heard everything about you. In fact, there were so many praises about you that... I got scared and rushed back. You got so scared that you forgot to shave? You've become very intelligent. I'm leaving now. Meet you at home. You're acting tough the moment you've arrived! - Do you want to fight with me? - I don't dare do that! Then come along straightaway. Otherwise I'll smash your nose. - You've become quite a fighter! - Yes. - I've a revolver all the time. - I see! The thing is, I have to meet mother first. - We will also accompany you. - That's agreeable. Mother! - Oh Mother! - My son! My son! Are you mad? He'll always be alive for us. It's just that he's out of our sight. Wipe off your tears. You wrote to me once that Mr. Dilip plays piano very well. He makes laughing people to weep, and weeping people to smile. Let me see your talent too! I'm not in the mood today. You're speaking like typical singers. No mood, or that the voice is sore. I'll hear the piano right now. Be seated. Why don't you encourage him, Neena? Please sing. What should I sing? I want to hear a romantic song. Whatever type it may be. But it should be a romantic song. Please sing. Wonderful! Only a heartbroken person can rightly appreciate such songs. You should ask me what I saw in his enchanting songs... his mesmerizing lyrics, and his heartrending stories. - Did you see a form of God? - Yes. He was the only one missing. He too has found his way here. Who is he? Professor Devdas Dharamdas Trivedi. A scholar of literature and philosophies. - He's a mobile trouble. - How did you end up with him? He used to play with me during father's time. Now he calls himself my guru! He says that he taught me when I was fooling around on swings. He doesn't even know A, B, C. But he insists on being called 'Professor'. - Of which subject is he a professor? - Nobody knows. He takes out frogs from hats and snakes from bags. Call him in. Let me also watch the fun. Don't you ever do that? Once he steps in... he won't step out for years. Better to slip off to the club. Tell him we're not here. We are here! I am right here, Professor. Welcome, Professor! A sin! What a big sin! You'll have to atone for it, Raju! How could you forget what I've taught you? My heart is feeling so hurt. Place your hand on my head and take a pledge that... you will never lie. Have you taken the pledge? It's your good fortune I've come to visit you. I was dying to see you, Raju! The taxi is parked outside. Arrange to send the fare. And arrange for an airy room where I can stay. - This is not my house, Master. - Calling me a master again? Rather, you should address me as a professor! Glad to meet you. Who's she? Have you gone mad? You are you inviting trouble for yourself? That's what I tell him. But he refuses to listen. If he doesn't listen, he'll be sorry some day. But I will fulfill my duty. I will continue to explain to him as long as I'm a guest here. But you don't have to be formal with me. Just remember that in food, I hate salt, spices and onion. As for my room, let it be a bit airy. Who's that gentleman? He's Mr. Dilip, Neena's friend. The first principle itself is wrong. Either get married, or just be friends. One cannot compose a western tune on a harmonium. Show him the airy room upstairs. - And I take precautions in my food. - Yes. Keep that in mind. I got a chance to talk to you alone after such a long time. But your eyes are searching for Dilip. Tell me, is Dilip your secretary, your bodyguard, or... Are you envious? We aren't even married yet. One is worried only before marriage. After marriage, why worry? Then everybody will know that this building belongs to Mr. Rajan. It's natural to feel jealous. He's such a good person that even if I were in your place... I 'd have been jealous, too. You might feel that way about him, not I. While in London, girls used to swoon over me. Really? Mr. Dilip, while the hunters are on their hunting spree... how about a round of cards? Would you like to play cards? What do you want to do? You want to dance? But you aren't married yet. With whom will you dance? Where's your wife? - I'll dance with Neena. - You too will dance with Neena? - That's the practice in society. - To hell with society! O God! May the earth break open, and I sink under it. I cannot see this living hell. A girl is dancing with her arms around another man's waist. What the hell is wrong with you people? How can such a society be yours? Those who behaved this way, have packed their bags and left. You too are wearing this imported suit. Who's talking to you? This suit doesn't belong to me. Where were you all this time? I was busy with my work. I don't like your acting haughty all the while. - Let's dance. - Some other time. I've to visit Uncle Dinesh at least for five minutes. - Otherwise he'll be angry. - Let's go. - But how to get rid of that trouble? - Don't worry. I'll fix him right away. I'm unable to make out whether you are back in India... or whether I've flown into some club in London. I arrived only today. I was just planning to visit your place. You lived in London for so many years. Did you ever think of me? He even forgot me, who made him what he is. Then how could he have remembered you? Rajan, who's she? Instead, why don't you introduce yourself? Since when did you start wearing sarees instead of frocks? Would you dance with me, Professor? I? And dance? Even my father never danced. One doesn't refuse a dance in society. We'll be insulted, Professor. Please go on. No, no. - Are the meals ready? - Yes. - Has Mr. Dilip returned? - Yes. He's in his room. Hiralal has gone to inform him. Your trouble is back again. - Where are you running away? - Where were you lost? I was telephoning you. You pushed me into hell, and then left me there all alone. What if I hadn't got a taxi? What would I've done then? Send the fare for the taxi. - Have you finished your meals? - No, we were waiting for you. Yes, of course. Mr. Dilip has said that he isn't feeling well. You may eat the meals. All right. Come on. Let's eat. O God! How should one rid oneself of this trouble? - Come on. - You carry on. I'll go and see what's keeping Dilip. - No, I won't go there alone. - Why? Are you scared of the guru? How are you feeling? At the club too, you left us behind. My heart is asking some worrying questions. I couldn't find any answer. Ask me. Perhaps I can offer some answers. I won't be able to express my dilemma to you. Go ahead. Mr. Rajan must be expecting you. Let him. I too have waited for him for years. Waited for him? But you never mentioned about it earlier? It happened so many times that I was about to tell you about it. Remember when you came to my home for the first time... I told you that one who waits knows how pleasurable it is. At Sheela's party too, I'd said that the lightning had already struck. You also said I shouldn't be under any wrong impression. You weren't my girlfriend that I'd have told you about my love story. But now you've become such a friend... who knows everything about my heart. One fine day, when I was travelling in a car... A juggler, are you? Who are you? I'm a juggler. I've come to trap a snake. Aren't you ashamed of making a fool of a girl? You're a girl? I thought you were a boy. You don't appear to be a decent fellow. Can I help you in any way? I don't want your help. Go away from here. I wonder why girls these days have to drive cars. - What's your name? - Neena. Sit in the car. I'll fix it. - You appear to be a good driver. - Will I get a job? Do come home. One fine day, when I was riding a horse, he saw me and followed me. What's the matter, Neena? Nothing. I was late, so I thought you must've had your breakfast. No, you aren't too late. What's the matter, Heera? The driver you asked to come has arrived. I didn't call any driver. I'll change and come, Daddy. If you didn't call him, how could he come here asking for you? Yes, Daddy. I had asked him to come. I forgot to tell you about him. Go and tell him to come some other day. One doesn't find good drivers these days. Go and call him. Or somebody else might employ him. You may speak to him. I'll go and change. No, be seated. Since you have called him, you should talk. You've been called inside. Stop! Come here! Greetings. Aren't you the son of the late Mr. Dayal? - Yes. - Be seated. Have breakfast before you go. Please put less sugar. Give him adequate breakfast and fix the salary. He's a good driver. I too like him. Do you promise to keep me ensconced in your heart all your life? I have already established your image in my heart... and I even make offerings of love flowers. Really? You mean I am your God? Then offer me flowers. Where do I get flowers? These are all wild flowers. They don't have any fragrance. Even if you touch paper flowers, they'll be filled with fragrance. You had better be careful. They're delicate and might be crushed. This flower will be my support all my life now. I'm going abroad. Will you wait for me? Once a priest offers flowers to his deity... it is never offered again to anybody else. No matter even if I have to wait all my life. What's the matter, Dilip? I hope you are fine. Should we send for a doctor? Will you offer food, or should I return home? Just imagine. I've returned only today. And I've been out all day. Mother must've even filed a police report that I'm missing. Come on now! I'm starving, while they are being so stylish. And here, they're all standing like statues. I'm starving. At least, offer me a glass of water. What? Nobody is listening? You'll all be dismissed today. Or else, immediately bring me food. - You haven't started yet? - What should I've eaten? This house? Even these things have a lot of vitamins. Please begin. Excuse me, but I've to get home soon. Otherwise, mother will impose a 24-hour curfew on me. Bring meals for him too. We're mistaken. The cook didn't prepare meals... as per his requirements. It doesn't matter. I don't follow restrictions when I am hungry. I eat anything. So how are you, Mr. Dilip? I'm speaking to you. How are you? - There's pain. - Pain? Where? In your heart? In the head. A headache is very dangerous. Hold on! Here, drink this. By morning, neither will you survive, nor your pain. Where is he? Who? Dilip? Your eyes must have been searching for him! Where is he? I won't be able to dance. It should be the same atmosphere. He should play the piano, you should stand in the front, and I dance. Let me also hear which atmosphere are you talking about. He's become envious. It has nothing to do with you. It's a secret between us. As you wish. He's not to be seen. Look after the guests, Rajan. I'll find him and bring him here. All right. When will the dancing begin? People have been praising you. How can she? Her Guru has vanished! I still haven't met your father. He must've come to the party today. Why don't you introduce me to him? No, he's gone to Kashi on a pilgrimage. Rajan, you youngsters will start dancing shortly. I'm an old man. Let me go. No, Uncle. Speak to Neena once she arrives. Who's he? He's my Uncle. Sheela's daddy! What a naughty girl! Such deeds of your daughter have made my heart get infatuated. What nonsense! Let's be seated. I wanted to speak about her marriage. Who are you? Don't you know where one discusses such things? I'm a straightforward person. My son is in love with your Sheela, while Sheela is all praises for him. If you and I don't finalize this alliance... the two of them will seal the matter themselves. If Sheela marries your son, I will shoot her dead. - Why? - What's your son's name? Dilip? Neena's partner? You are his father? You're quite an interesting person! Sheela is like your daughter! You may take her whenever you like. Why to delay an auspicious development? The 23rd of this month is decided then. You outdo even women in getting dressed up. Everybody is waiting for you at the party. The piano is lying silent. And everybody is keen to watch Sheela dance. What a strange night this is. Everything in the world is so restless. I'm also taking my restless heart far away so that it calms down. Where? Wherever destiny takes me. What's wrong with you? I won't let you go. - You cannot stop me now. - Don't be crazy. Come to your senses. I've come to my senses. That's why I'm going. Have I been mistaken? Not you. I've been mistaken. What's your mistake? That I love you. Why did Dilip go away? I had already told you that Rajan has taken a place in my heart... where, except for God, I can't make anybody else more important. Take back your words. Say that you didn't say what you did. Once an arrow is shot, the wound cannot be healed. I have always looked upon you as my friend. I never loved you. Don't stir the suppressed fire. Before its flames reach out to you, it's better that I leave. Go away! You're most welcome! You think that I will hold you back fearing a bad name for me? Go away! If my getting a bad name can heal your wounds... I'm most willing. Go away. I love nobody but Rajan. When I'm no more, you'll remember my words. I wonder why I don't like so much freedom. Invite him if you wish. You are still sitting here? I thought you'd gone to fetch Dilip. Look at your face. People will think that I married you forcefully. Wait Rajan. I want to tell you something. All right. Go ahead. - Daddy had once said... - I know that! He said it in my presence. He said that he likes the driver, and that you should fix my salary. Look, Daddy! Even if Neena doesn't like it... I'll place you elsewhere anyway. Whenever there's a joyous occasion, Neena comes here and starts weeping. And upsets the whole program. Explain to her. Otherwise... I love you! I love you! If you continue to think along such lines... then society won't allow you to survive. I see! So the new bride is feeling shy. Bravo! Carry on feeling shy! It's also necessary to carry out the ritual of feeling shy. This enchanting night, and riveting breeze. Why're you sitting like an old-fashioned bride? You may pull over your saree too. Your place is in my heart, Neena. Fruits? Tea? Letters, sir! Give me my letter. - First salute me! - I won't. Salute me! Gosh! Why don't you cut your finger nails? I don't. Because I don't want to. 'Neena, he loves somebody else' Anything special in the letter? Don't hide anything from me. Let me know too. Read it yourself. It's from Sheela. Did you read it? If you wish, this marriage can take place. How? I don't know that. Let's have breakfast. We've to go out. Why don't you get married? Because I love you. I'm already married. I don't love anybody but Rajan. You love me, Neena. The kind of love which sometimes a person doesn't even realize. To understand it, one has to merge oneself in it. Have you ever tried to understand it? No, I don't want to understand it. Rajan is my God. Did you hear? Rajan is my God. - Hide me in your heart. - What's the matter? I had become somewhat scared. What did you write? 'You haven't sent for your goods for a week.' 'So we are having to face a lot of losses.' 'If you don't collect your goods within 3 days...' - 'according to the contract...' - We will cancel your order. He works all day long. I tell him to care for his health too. Please be seated. What brings you here? I was forced to come since you don't visit us. You didn't even attend the party. Sheela was very upset. She hosted the party mainly for your sake. I regret it myself. But because of some work, I couldn't attend. Ask Sheela on my behalf to please forgive me. I won't interfere between the two of you. She's very upset. Come and appease her yourself. All right. I'll come personally when I find some time. In fact, you should visit her at least twice daily. She can't come to you now. Can't you even understand such a small thing? Why? I hope everything is fine. How is Sheela? Ever since your Daddy has finalized about it... she has even stopped coming to me out of shyness. Daddy? My Daddy? - It's confirmed. - What's confirmed? Speak on. Don't make statements which hurt the heart. What can I do? I'm mistaken. Since I've given my heart, you may harass me as much as you like. But you had better remember that after the marriage... I will seek my revenge. Perhaps this is why you didn't tell Daddy about marriage yourself. You conveyed it through D.D.T. Yes, dear? I want to speak to you about something. Come to this room. Whatever you want to say, say it in his presence. Excuse me, I want to speak to you in private. I know what you are going to do and tell me. Please wait here. Don't go away. He's a very insistent boy. Why're you closing the door? Let it be open. Let the breeze come in. Why did you do that? Speak from a distance. Don't be angry with me. - Speak with some understanding. - I should be understanding? What wrong have I done? Whatever I've done, it is in your interest. Sheela is always so romantically inclined towards you. I noticed that, and finalised your marriage. Who are you to finalise my marriage? One makes even a donkey a father. Am I worse than a donkey? You're worse than that since you played with a decent man's honor. - Know how he will feel if I refuse? - Then marry Sheela. I don't love Sheela. - Then whom do you love? - I love rocks. - Rocks could break your head. - You had better hear this. You might be Mr. Rajan's friend. But I cannot tolerate such a joke. Get lost! All right. I am going. But remember, you'll regret it one day. Why don't you marry Sheela? Why cause suspicion to Rajan? You should get married to Sheela. It's been 4 or 5 months here now. I feel bored. Let's return to the city. - Why? - Because... here you feel scared at night, during the day. Is it within my control not to feel feared? - Why not leave this place? - I don't want to go to the city. I feel terrified even thinking about it. Why? ls there some ghost there who would bite you? Why're you talking such nonsense? Nonsense? It's a question of somebody's life. Whose life? Poor Sheela's. Why doesn't Dilip get married to her? He might not love her. Then whom does he love? I have married you willingly, not because of any pressure. I regret you don't understand me even now. Do you realise how much you've insulted me and my love? Do you realise how much you've hurt me now? I could never have imagined that you'd say such a thing. Go to sleep now. Carry on playing it all night. Still, I won't talk to you. Enough. Enough. Why're you making all the noise? Stop this noise! Don't stop it. I will break your instrument today. Snake, snake, snake! Rajan. Congratulations, it's a girl. A girl! My daughter? And how's Neena? Very happy. Not now. In half an hour Wow! She's my...! Congratulations on the little Neena! You've won, while I've lost. - Then why did we argue? - I was mistaken. - Do you admit that I'm your God? - Yes, I do. What condition are you in? You're wearing the tie wrongly. You didn't even put on a flower on the coat? How could I? After all, you have spoiled me. I can't live even for a moment without you. Remaining away from you for a few moments... I felt as if I'd lost everything I had. And that I'd been left helpless, all alone. Who are you talking to? I've already died in your thoughts. And I've died much before you. Rather, somebody should ask me how a dead person is. Here comes another sick person! Ask me how she spent every day waiting for you. She kept her love for you hidden for years. While just because you had to stay away for a few years... you started complaining! Neena, men are very dangerous. Never tell them that you love them. Otherwise they won't give you a damn. How can you act like a toy for her all day long? You've ruined her schedule. She neither eats nor sleeps. - Come on. Go to sleep now. - Why did you make her cry? She'll cry when she's hungry. She'll sleep when she's tired. - That's how the child gets spoiled! - She's such a little child! Don't you feel envious because she loves me more? Yes, I feel envious! Let her sleep now. Or we'll fight! You know that I enjoy fulfilling her whims and fancies... - as much I love your style. - But I don't like your love at all. How can I bear to see my child crying? Didn't your Daddy fulfill all your desires? That's what I don't want. How should I explain to you what I feel? Why I feel so scared by your abundant love? You can keep feeling scared. We'll go to the city to celebrate her birthday. City? Why do you lose your temper at the mention of the city? We've been living here for 2 years. We won't stay here any longer. I feel terrified at the thought of the city. I don't do well there. Don't you ever mention the city again! You are upset? You want to go the city? All right. I am ready. After a long wait, finally the day has come when I can hand over... all the responsibilities and become a free person. Before your marriage, I was under the false impression that you loved me. On the wedding night... when I expressed my love for you for the first time... I realized then that you loved Rajan. I would've left on that very day. But I stayed back fearing that you would get a bad name. The fifty per cent share of your business that you gave me... I gift it to your daughter on her first birthday. Dilip, everything about you is becoming a new problem for me. You don't realise how sad I am. Why are you posing problems for me, Rajan and my daughter? Why don't you marry Sheela? Do you want to destroy my family life and watch the fun? All right then. Congratulations, Neena. This is a gift on your daughter's birthday. Then who was it there? Believe me, there's nobody except you in my heart. I always treated him as my friend. But he took my friendship wrongly. I wanted to tell you about it that day. Why didn't you listen then? Then I got scared. That's why I continued to hide it from you... so you wouldn't misunderstand me and I lose your love. I am living on the strength of your love. I don't love anybody except for you. I know that you're naive. You can never have a bad feeling. But meeting a stranger so freely... can surely give a wrong impression to him and the society. Forgive me, Daddy. I didn't listen to you that day. I thought if my heart was clear, why should I bother about society? But I was mistaken. You know that I'm innocent. But society calls me guilty. Even my Rajan thinks I'm guilty. I'll go and tell Dilip that he should leave. He can't stay here now. 'You saved my life. But one word from you also poisoned it too' 'My Rajan has started to suspect me now' 'You've obliged me many times. Oblige me once more' 'Go away from here for good' 'You'll continue to receive your share of the money' Where'd you go so early in the morning? Where'd you go so early in the morning? You didn't have tea or breakfast. I was waiting for you. I thought of having tea in some hotel today. What's wrong with it? You went without wearing the tie properly, or putting a flower. Put it now. It doesn't have any fragrance any longer. Come, dear. Come to your father! Come on, dear. Why do you play with this? It's not good. It's very bad. I'll get you another. Let's throw it away. Why do you weep? You too like it? There's no accounting for taste Don't worry. You may have it. Bye bye. Listen. Me? Yes? Do you really think there's no fragrance in it now? The thing is, I'm suffering from a cold. Listen... We've to attend Sheela's party this evening. At what time? - 5 o'clock. - At 5 o'clock? Please don't mind it. I'm on my way to meet mother. From there, I'll be going to play tennis at 5 o'clock. You may attend the party along with Dilip. A child too has been born. But her style remains unchanged. For how long can a husband continue to bear with it? It would've been different if there were a lover. I want to tell you something. Tell me? Go ahead. What're you thinking about? Speak up. This flower suits only you. You're being formal. It's more suited to you. It's not my decoration. Rather, you are seeing it wrongly. I'm leaving here today. Before leaving, I wanted to clear the misunderstanding. Once a priest offers a flower to his deity... he can never offer it again to anybody else. Forget it. Such things have no meaning any more. Moreover, where's the priest? Keep bearing the atrocities of his unfeeling attitude... and continue your existance Continue smiling, as you always do, swallowing your tears This is the dictum of love, oh heart He gives you the anguish of suffering, while you pray for him to be blessed That one glance of his which has made a home in your heart... sustain yourself on that single glance of his Even if society troubles you or the world punishes you... you go on longing for him Keep bearing the atrocities of his unfeeling attitude... and continue your existance Continue smiling, as you always do, swallowing your tears You're still standing here? You didn't leave? You were listening to your send-off song? You didn't get the permission? Just think. How could she give you the permission? After all, who would handle such a big business? Life's intricacies can never be solved with a poisonous temperament. I too have a lot to say. But only truthfulness and straightforwardness... can solve the misunderstandings. I regret that you couldn't understand your wife even till now. I know. You understand my wife better than I, right? I do. That's what I have come to explain to you. I see. Tell this nonsense just to her. I'm no longer interested in your pretensions. Don't take advantage of her love. The whole world is willing to bow down to her. Still, she made you her God. After having acquired her... you began thinking of yourself not as a human, but God. But don't you forget that the one who has made you a God... is the same pure Goddess, whose devotion you think is an act. You are unfit for her! Save him, doctor. He shouldn't die. Take my life. But snatch him away from death. My life depends on him. I can't say anything for sure at this stage. It's possible that he might survive. Is he dead? No, he cannot die. If he dies, how will I ever be able to face Rajan? He's the proof of my innocence. No! He cannot die! You cannot die, Dilip! You cannot die, Dilip. Who says that I've died? Who says I've died? I can never die. Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Move away! He has gone crazy! Leave me. What're you doing? No, dear. - He's hell bent on killing somebody. - Leave me, doctor. - He might kill somebody. - I am not scared of death. Don't worry, Neena. He will recover. But he should be moved away from here immediately. It's very dangerous for him to continue living here. Doctor, she hasn't eaten anything since last night. Please explain to her and make her eat. Come on, dear. - Have you fed milk to the baby? - Yes. Please eat the meals. What's the matter? - You're hiding something. - Nothing. Where's baby? Bring the baby to me. Master has taken baby away. Welcome, welcome. Tell me, how did you take the trouble? Baby, do you recognize her? No? She's your Mummy! How's your sick person? I'm such an uncivilized person. Why did I have to hit him? Come on. Sit in the car. I'll come and ask for a pardon. Have you finished? Or do you still have to shoot any more arrows? If I knew how to shoot arrows, why would I have been hurt? You can cut open my heart and see whose picture is inside. The picture is right in front of me. I don't know how to murder a heart. There's a limit to tolerance. What exactly do you want? What I want doesn't matter. You tell me what you want. Speak up. You want to rid yourself of me? All right. I'm moving away. You may do whatever you please. You are free. You're wealthy. You're beautiful. You've a heart which loves. So what if a Rajan is not there? Rajan means everything to me. A world devoid of Rajan is like hell for me. We won't go back to that hell now. What say, Baby? Let's go away. Bye. Bye bye. You are so ruthless. Though you are a God to me, still you don't pardon me? Even God won't pardon you. Aren't you satisfied even after bringing a bad name to the family? You had snatched away my son from me! You too have snatched my child away from me. You don't deserve to be called her mother. Go away from here! Before she is old enough to realise that you are her mother... you should go and strangle yourself. Shameless girl! Get out of here! I thought my Rajan has come. Where is he? He has ruined me by taking support of this enchanting face. He has struck me with lightning through these pink lips... to eliminate my desires. Before eliminating that dacoit... I'll extinguish this fire for good... which has caused me heartburn. This will be your last and biggest obligation. The hands which gave me a new lease on life... those same hands should bring an end to my miserable life. Perhaps my death might clear me of my innocent crimes. Alas! Only if my Rajan too could hear that... at the time of death too, Neena took Rajan's name. That ungrateful fellow won't know how the glow of the lamp is. He ran away fearing being burned. This beautiful look... these intoxicating eyes... these burning flames... I'm not going away to be scared by it and run away. You, you are mine! - Leave me. - Nobody can take you away from me. - Leave me. - You're mine! Nobody can separate you from me. You've fallen to such an extent that you've lost your decency too. You aren't even human anymore. The heart which was proud of your friendship, now hates you. You know that I'm a married woman. My respect is Rajan's respect. And I will protect it till my death. Even if I have to shoot dead the one who obliged me. Shoot me dead. Shoot me dead if you can bear to see me suffering. Shoot me dead. You cannot kill me. Why is your hand shaking? Why is your heart beating rapidly? That's because you love me. - I don't love anybody except Rajan. - Ask your heart. There's nobody except Rajan in my heart. You're lying. You love me. You love me. Were you in love with Dilip? Were you in love with Dilip or not? Did Neena ever express to you about Dilip's love? - Did Neena love Dilip or not? - Neena loves only Rajan. Do you recognise this woman? Do you recognise this woman? You don't recognise your wife? If I did recognise her... why did I have to come here to identify her? On the one hand, she called me God and offered me flowers of love. On the other hand, she made the innocent Dilip crazy about her... by parties, clubs, ballrooms, clubs and every Western style. What proof do you have that Neena loves Dilip... on the basis of which you rejected her? Is this not adequate proof that before I came... she never told Dilip that Rajan too was a part of her life. She used to enchant me by calling me God. Before our marriage, she trapped Dilip in her clutches... by giving him half her property and business... so that he is never able to separate from her. And after marriage, after having separated from him... she couldn't sleep peacefully even for a single night. And because of her love for him... she didn't even let her friend Sheela marry him. When I asked her why Dilip doesn't marry Sheela... she said that he doesn't love her. Then whom does he love? There was no reply. Then she got upset and said that I've insulted her love. And Rajan, blinded by his love for her... considered her every lie to be the truth. And against her wishes, when I brought her back from Simla... in the darkness, she thought I was Dilip... and confessed her love to me. Blinded by love, you looked every aspect about Neena with suspicion. If she loved Dilip, how could she murder him? She has murdered him just to cheat me. She has murdered Dilip only to falsely convince society that... she is a devoted wife. She kept her husband alive... only because he could protect her from being lambasted by society. In the eyes of the court, she is guilty of killing Dilip. But I assure you, she is guilty of killing two innocent people. She killed one and brought him peace for good... and she made another person's life a living hell. She's the living example of your modern society... who calls her lover a friend only to comfort her husband. I had a lot to defend myself. But after Rajan's testimony, I don't want to say anything. I am a culprit in the eyes of society... because I never cared for the society. And I never listened to my Daddy. If I had listened to him that day... I wouldn't have had to see such a day. I should be punished. Dilip was my friend. I have murdered him. You can weep, but I can't. Your Mummy's destiny will be determined today. Perhaps she might be released. But she has doomed us to suffer all our lives. Where should I bring your Mummy now? Your Mummy didn't belong to us. She didn't belong to us. This has snatched your Mummy from us. Why do you keep it so close to your heart? Throw it away. He has snatched your Mummy from us. 'I have loved you' 'A kind of love which if lovers had known would give examples of' 'By ruining my world, I have learned that... 'an Indian woman loves only once and only one person' 'And that fortunate person is your Rajan' The jury has unanimously decided that under Section 302... you should be hanged to death. At the same time, they have even pleaded mercy for you. Therefore... I sentence you to be deported to Kala Pani for penal servitude. My heart said that you will surely come. You weren't at fault. Anybody else in your place would've felt suspicious like you did. I was at fault. So was the society which I had been a part of. I am suffering because of that. I just want from you that... you should keep our daughter away from such an atmosphere. The foreign soil and atmosphere can never be suitable for our children. Whether you believe me or not... You are still my God.
