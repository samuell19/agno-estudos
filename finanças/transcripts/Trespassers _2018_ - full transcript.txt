Listen to me! I didn't take it. You don't have to do this! You don't have to do it! Listen to me! You don't have to do this, man! What are you doing? Why are you doing this? We didn't steal anything! We didn't do anything! Why are you doing this to us? What are you doing? - Hey. Donde esta? - I already told you. It's in the house. Please! It's supposed to be our check-in, right? Yeah, that's what they said. Huh, I guess the door is open. Hello? We're here for the noon check-in. Guess we make ourselves at home then. - Hey. - Hey. You were definitely right about this being your dream home. They're amazing photographers. They work as photo journalists down in Mexico. I haven't been in one of these since college. Looks like the owners were in the middle of developing something. There's still a negative in here. Check this out. Oh. They're here. - Hey! Hi! - Hi! Hi! Es. I can't believe you're here. - Oh, I missed you. - I know. Wow, your hair got so long. Oh, look at you. You look great. - Oh, please. You're glowing. - Thank you. Okay, I've been on this juice cleanse this past month. Turmeric, charcoal. It works wonders. Babe, I'm sweating my balls off. Come on. - Well, then come in. - Wow! This is what I'm talking about. - Yeah. Hey, baby! - Yes! Hey, say hi to Sarah. My high school bestie? - Huh? - Hi. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - How are you? - How you doing? My name's Joe. - Victor. Nice to meet you. - Oh, I got you guys this. - Hey, thank you. - That's so sweet. - Thank you so much. - You guys know each other. - How are you? - Oh, yeah! I'm good, I'm good. - Good, good. So, uh, bedrooms are this way? - Hey. - Oh, yeah. Hi. Yeah, let me show you to your room. You can drop off your bags. Yeah. Down here and to the right. Yeah. - Whoa! - It's a little messy, but.. I still don't understand why we couldn't just come here alone. Come on. You know why. I think it's really good for us to be around other people. Come here. Talk about the middle of nowhere, right? Yeah. So, what's the plan, Joey boy? We're gonna go and find some weird strip clubs or something? Strip clubs, really? - Yeah, maybe they're hiring. - That's funny. How'd you guys find this place? Um, just found it online. Kinda got lucky. We don't need to watch out for border hoppers? Jesus, babe. Kidding. They can have it anyway. The whole country's goin' to shit. All I know is I won't be sober when the world ends. - I will drink to that. - Hell, yes. - Thank you. - Alright. - Cheers. - Cheers. Whoo! Well, what do you expect givin' a junior developer admin access to a live database on his first day? Yeah, totally, man. Carnage. Fuck, babe! What the fuck? We've gotta ration ourselves, huh? - For the weekend, yeah? Hmm? - Yeah. Like a fuckin' vacuum, this one. Ah.. Oh. Sorry, man. You want a hit? I'm... I'm good, man. Thank you, though. I'm fine, I appreciate it though. It's all, it's all you. Ah, okay. I get it. Totally get it. I used to be pussy-whipped myself. Oh, no. You can't smoke in here. What? You, you're joking, right? Yeah. Hey. Hey. Hey, what are you doin' over here? - What are you lookin' at? - Just lookin' at this book. Isn't this place so nice? I love it so much. I wish I never had to leave. Hey, enjoy the dream while it lasts. I guess. So how long you guys been together? Well, she's gonna say a year but I'd say like three-four months. - Okay, and you guys met how? - Hey. I'm really sorry we haven't been in touch. Mm. Hey, it's okay. Life happens. I mean, sooner or later, we all grow up, right? I know, but growing up doesn't mean we don't talk anymore. I shoulda reached out. I'm sorry. It's just been a really strange year for me. I know, babe. Well, I don't know, if you wanna, you know talk about it, I'm, I'm here for you. - Thank you. I'm good. - Okay. I don't wanna talk about it. I just wanna... have fun and forget that the world exists for a bit. - I can help you with that. - I know. - That's why you're here. - What do we have over here? Oh, my God! I love this album. Yes. Are you, are you ready to dance with me? - Uh-huh. - Ooh, you're gonna love this. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Come on, dance with me. Come on. Wooh! Oh, oh, oh. Fancy. Come on, girl. Whoo! Ooh! Hey! Damn, I missed you. Show me. Let's just.. Just turn around. Keep going. Keep going. Hey, we don't have to do this. Shut up, keep going. Don't stop. Do it, do it. What's wrong? What's goin' on? - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah? Who's your fuckin' daddy? Who's your fuckin'.. - Yeah. - Yeah? - You like that? Mm-hm? - Mm-hm. Die young and leave a pretty corpse. Way too many bad habits as it is. Suit yourself. Oh, well. Oh. You get a good look? So what are we gonna do about this little predicament of ours? Do? We're not gonna do shit. We're gonna keep our mouths shut. - So nothing happened, right? - Nothing happened. I got way too drunk, stupidly hooked up with some girl I had no business being with. The end. The end. Wow! Well... enjoy the view. - How'd they turn out? - Good. I'm pretty good. - Want to see? - Yeah. Dork. Hey, I'm sorry if things got weird earlier. I mean, I know that they got weird. I'm just sorry.. What the fuck was that? Why would someone be here so late? Fuck if I know. I don't know. I can't see who it is. Well, that's why you open the door to see who it is. What? No, don't... don't answer the door. - Babe, it's fine. - Shit. Well, you're not Melissa. I'm sorry. I was expecting Melissa. Is she home? - No. No, she's not. - Is Michael then? We're renting from them this weekend. So, they're not here. - Oh, I see, I see. - Everything alright, Sarah? Who's that? Th... that's my husband. Oh, so you're Sarah? It's nice to meet you, Sarah. I am so sorry for bangin' on your door this late at night but I'm a neighbor, and my car broke down just down the road and I just, I thought, "Oh, God, thank God Melissa's place is right around the corner." So I popped by and I was wondering if I could just use the phone really quick. 'Cause my... my... my boy is at home with the babysitter and at this point, I'm, like, I don't know, an hour late. I was trying to fix the car of course and I just, I'm pretty much desperate to get a hold of him. Sure. Why don't you use my cellphone? Oh. There is no reception out here, unfortunately. The desert. - Middle of nowhere, you know? - Right. I promise you I will be... two seconds and then I will be out of your hair. Um, could you.. Let me.. Could you just hang on one second? Please. Oh, please, please. It's just, just.. I would be... Of course. I just, just one sec. It's the middle of the night. Is this really what you wanna be doing right now? Oh, come on, man. You'd expect anyone to do the same thing for you. I don't expect anything from anyone. Ever. She obviously knows the owners of the house. She just needs to make a call. She has a broken down car with kids at... - Bullshit! - You know what? Help somebody else out for once. You don't want her to come in why don't you go fix her car instead? I want us to go back five minutes leave the fuckin' door closed. One call. - Two seconds. - You are an angel. Sorry to keep you waiting. You know.. ...finding truly kind people in this world today is like finding a... a diamond in a sea of glass. Phone's right back there. Thank you so much. - Hi. - Hi. Good evening. Pardon me. Hey. So what do we do now? Well, she's just gonna make a call so we'll just wait. Okay. But if you're tired, you can go to bed. You don't have to stay up. No, it's cool. I'll hang with you. Come here. Hm, remember when we used to have sleepovers? Mm-hm, my parents would hate it 'cause you would just eat all of our food. Well, you had the best snacks. Mm. That is true. Wow, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. You don't have to be here if you don't want. You can go in another room too, you know. Thanks, but you don't have to tell me what to do. - Mm, I'm not. - Yeah, you clearly are. Wee bit of trouble in paradise? I apologize. I didn't mean to eavesdrop. I couldn't help but overhearing. You know, my husband and I we used to go at it pretty regular and it, it got ugly. But you know what got us through? It didn't matter what happened during the day how much we fought we always pray together at night. You've gotta cherish the good. A man hath no greater thing under the sun than to eat, to drink, and to be merry. But we're divorced now. I had to jump off that train, Doomsday Express. I learned the hard way. One cannot live in bad faith. But she is right, you know? You do have to communicate. - How'd that call go? - Perfect. I spoke to my boy and the babysitter is tucking him in. - So.. - How old is he? He just turned seven. He's my little babycakes. - That's a fun age. - It is. You know, you'd love him, he is.. He's somethin' else. Can I ask? Why did you guys divorce? Mm. Well.. Sometimes you just can't stop what's coming. At the end of the day, he can lie to you and you can lie to him but you can't lie to yourself. Goodness. You know, I was so relieved to hear his voice I completely forgot to call the tow truck. And here I am prattling on like God knows what, I, I am sorry. No. Please. It's late, late, late, late. So I'll make that call, and then I'll be out of your hair. - I should go check on Victor. - Okay. No offense, but I'd rather stick my dick in a cactus than get marriage counseling from some fuckin' middle of the night drifter. Okay? She's actually not that bad, she's kinda sweet. - What? - Yeah. It's Joe and Sarah who are being fucking weird. No shit. Babe, just come back out there so I'm not alone, okay? Mm, nah. I'm gonna smoke this and then go to bed. You know, you're not going to sleep right now. Come on, let's have fun. I promise I'll make it up to you. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hm. How you gonna do that? Do that thing you like. - Alright. - Babe. But only 'cause you're so cute. - But Mary Poppins has gotta go. - Fine with me. Just promise me you won't do it like an asshole. Okay? And all this time, I thought that's why ya liked me. Round up the party favors 'cause we're gonna need 'em with these two. Come on, guys. While we're still breathing, please. Trying to have a party. Fucking woman in the house. Dude, relax. You're gonna have a heart attack. Dude, shut the fuck up. Don't tell me what to do. Alright? She's almost done, okay? Well, she's got two minutes and then I'm pullin' the plug on this shit. Yep, just me and four of my lovely new friends. We'll be here. Mm-hm. Hello? Hello? I can't seem to get any reception. Is there something wrong with the phone? No, you're fine there. Do you mind if I try in another room? Yeah, sure. Try the studio. Wow! You really wear the pants in the relationship, huh? Knock that shit off, man. Ooh, whoo-whoo, whoo-whoo! Tension in the air. Oh, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah. You know, Sarah sometimes, it's... it's good to let a guy be a guy, you know? Have an opinion, speak for himself... - Victor, shut up. - Alright, just sayin'. I'm here all night if you need some advice. Okay? They're beautiful, aren't they? Uh. Um.. Yeah, I guess. I don't really know. You know, some Native American people believe that taking a photograph can steal a soul. Imprisoning it forever in this brew of celluloid and salt. Some tribes spend their whole lives avoiding being photographed. Have you seen any of their other works? No. I don't really have an eye for this sort of thing. Sarah's the artist. I don't think I've ever been in a house with this much beautiful art. - I thought you knew the owners? - I do. Why? No reason. Woof. Woof is right. Come here. Tonight kinda got away from us, huh? Yes, it did. Hey, um, I know I haven't been that easy to talk to. I'm workin' on it, okay? It's been hard for me too, you know? I'm just tryin' to find a way for us to get through this. I'm trying to, too, I really, truly am. I... just feel stuck, I feel like I can't.. Like it's not possible, sometimes. Sarah. But I know that it is, and I want this to work. - Sarah, where's her car? - I really want.. - What? - Her broken down car. It was on the street. Where is it? I don't know. Maybe it got towed or something. No. I didn't see a tow truck show up. Did you hear what I just said? - I... - Let's go inside. Where is she? Uh, she's in the studio, why? - Her car's gone. - What? Her car that's supposed to be broken down is gone. I knew it. She called for help. Maybe it came. Are you for real? No, I kinda.. I think Joe's right. I was just talkin' to her about the art in the house and... I mean, it was like she'd never been here before. Well, why didn't you say anything? - Well.. - Oh, wait, I remember. It's 'cause you never use your fuckin' head. Hey, don't fucking yell at me. I didn't think it was a big deal. You didn't think it was a big deal? Alright, you guys can live in your little fantasy land all you want where everybody holds hands and helps each other, but that's not the world we live in. - Bad things happen. - Jesus, what is your problem? Oh, my problem is whose stupid idea was it to even open the fuckin' door to begin with? Hey, back the fuck off, man, alright? Oh, yeah, or fuckin' what? What's goin' on? Let there be light. It's nothing divine. It's just a power outage. We have them all the time up here it's why we have backup generators. - Where's your car? - What, my car? It's outside, wha.. Is something wrong? Alright. I'm sick of this. Lady, I don't know what scam you're running but you need to get the fuck out of this house. Right now! Hello? Anyone there? It must be nice having such a big, strong man to protect you here at night, huh? Maybe you're not hearing me. Get out, or I'm gonna drag you out by your little fuckin' skinny ankles. - Do you understand? - Babe. Oh, it's fine. Obviously, I have outstayed my welcome. Mm-hm. But I'm not the Wicked Witch Of The West, honey. I'm a neighbor. You don't have to be rude. I'll just go grab a glass of water and I'll be on my way. Jesus Christ. Call the police. 911, what's.. - You deaf? - What the fuck? What part of get out of our house do you not understand? - Get the fuck off me! - Get the fuck out of our house! - Because you're in our house! - What is wrong with you... What the fuck's wrong with me? What the fuck's wrong with you? - Babe, I g.. I got it. - Calm down. Hey! You need to get.. What are you doing? Get the fuck out of our house! Victor, chill the fuck out, man! Chill the fuck out! Chill the fuck out! Chill the fuck.. Ah! Ah.. - Oh, shit. - Oh.. - Oh, shit. Oh.. - Oh, my God. What happened? Uh, she... she attacked me. I.. I mean... I mean... I mean, you saw, you saw that, right? Did she? Hm? Oh. I, I didn't.. You see? Here was a gun. See, she... she... she had a gun. She had a gun, it... it... it... it was self-defense. Hm? You killed her. You killed her! Oh, no, no. Don't, don't fuckin' say that. Take it easy. Take it easy. I... I... I didn't do anything wrong. Babe, I didn't do anything wrong.. You're right. Victor, you're right. Why don't you give me the gun? Whoa. Just calm down... Why don't you shut the fuck up and let me think? - Hm? - Okay. Okay. Alright, go sit down, everybody. - Victor. - Go sit down! - Okay. - Come on, come on. - What, is somethin' the matter? - No. - Huh? - No. Why are you looking at me like that? Why are you looking at me like that? I'm not. I'm not, I'm... Why are you looking at me like that? - Baby, I'm not. - Why, you think I did this? - No, I didn't say.. - You think I did this? - I didn't say that. - I didn't fuckin' do this. - I know. I know.. - I didn't do this, I didn't.. Shut the fuck up. - Stop fuckin' crying! - Ah! Let me think! Alright? Not a fucking word! Hey, you okay? Hey, you okay? It's okay. It's okay. Just leave her. She's fine! She's fuckin' fine. Just make it stop. Alright, it's gonna be okay. We're gonna be okay. Alright? We're gonna be fine. Just.. We just need to think. For a little while. We just need to think. Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. We're... we're... we're gonna clean this up. We're gonna get rid of the body and then, and then we're all gonna leave. - Okay? - That doesn't make any sense. Yeah? You know what doesn't make any sense? Opening the fuckin' door to a fuckin' stranger. Okay? I agree. I agree, alright? That was self-defense. We don't have to hide the body, alright? We can just tell the truth. We can just tell the cops what happened. Nope. No. No, we're.. No, we're not gonna tell anyone anything. I mean, I'm cleanin' up your mess. Because you couldn't keep your fuckin' door.. - Hey! - Ah! Get the fuck off her! - Or fucking what? - Okay. Okay. Just let her go. Just let her go. - Sit down. - Alright. Okay. Please. What do you wanna do? We're gonna clean this up. Together. You and me. I'm sorry, Estelle. We're gonna clean this up together. You and me. Go. - Let's go. - Get out. - Let's go! - Okay. Hm. Now we're in this together, brother. You and me. Okay. Hey, come on. Let's go. - I... I can't. - Hey. - Come on, let's go. - I'm sorry. Why? No, come on. Let's go. I hate him so fucking much. I thought coming here would make it better but when he gets like that I... I don't know what to do. - We're gonna leave. - No. We're gonna leave. You're gonna get away from him. - No. No! - Yes. He will fucking kill me. I won't let that happen. I.. I'm sorry. I need... I need Victor out of my life. Yeah, well, that makes two of us. Okay? You don't understand. He's a fucking monster. And I... I... I can't... I can't do it anymore. Look at me. The only thing we need to worry about right now is getting the hell out of this house. Okay? You're stronger than he is. You... you could stop him. - Are you out of your mind? - Please help me. - Please. - Look. I'm not in the mood to get shot tonight because you can't break up with some abusive asshole. What do you think is gonna happen when Victor finds out? You're just as fucked up as he is. Do you know that? You two belong together. At least he's not a coward like you. What's going on? I'm gonna go check on Sarah. Take a shower. Then we're getting out of here. Whenever.. Whenever I'm around you whenever I see you, I.. I think about it. I can't think about it anymore. What do you want? Um.. ...to escape. I think I.. I think I have to do it alone. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. If I was you I wouldn't wanna be with me either. No. No, it's not.. It's okay. I slept with someone else. It was with Estelle. I fucked up. I'm a piece of shit. I felt like what happened with us and the baby was my fault. I felt like it was me getting punished somehow. You getting punished, yeah. That's probably what happened. ...fuckin' times? I told you, it was just that once. Please, calm down. Go ahead. Go ahead, tell Sarah what you just told me. Go on. Tell her! I already fuckin' know. I don't give a fuck! - What the hell's going on here? - Oh, hey, stud. Welcome to the party. We were just talkin' about how you put your fucking dick in my fucking girl! how you put your fucking dick in my fuckin' girl! is just get the hell out of here, alright? Shut the fuck up! After everything I did for you, babe? What, you were just gonna.. You were just gonna fuckin' leave me here? Huh? Is that what you were gonna do? - No. - Victor. I told you to shut the fuck up! Sarah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't fuckin' talk to her! Hey, okay. Okay, let's just.. Let's... let's... let's get out... I will fuckin' end you, bitch! ...each other ever again! She's right. That was the plan, right? Ah, I know your plan, asshole! I know your plan, huh? Set me up? You're gonna feed me to the fuckin' dogs so you and this bitch can live happily ever after. You're gonna kill us all? Then what? Then what? What is there to do.. Don't fuckin' tell me what to do or I will fucking kill you right now. Okay? You can walk away right now, man. There's nothing.. You didn't do anything yet, okay? - You didn't do anything. - No, fuck. But you kill us, that's not good, man. - You're going to jail forever. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Baby, I love you. I'm sorry. You love me? - Really? You love me? - I'm sorry. Oh, you're just a little whore with a heart of gold, aren't you, huh? Don't fucking touch me! I'm fucking done with you! Don't fucking touch me ever again. I fucking hate you! I'm fucking done with you. - Don't come near me. - Or fucking what, bitch? Fucking.. Police. Open up. What are we gonna do? What do we do? Get the door. Get rid of them. Now. Alright, okay, okay. I got it. I.. Okay. Okay. We got a call about a home invasion. Yes. Sorry, you scared us there for a second. - D'you make the call? - Mm-hmm. - You alright? - Yeah, sorry. Just a little freaked out. How 'bout you, are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, thank you, thank you. Thank you. - You are? - I'm Estelle. Estelle, and your friend? Sarah. So you said there was someone inside, refused to leave? Yeah. But she's gone now, so.. - You sure? - Mm, yeah. Mm-hmm. What's with the lights? Power outage. It's happened twice tonight. Sarah, Estelle. Why don't you take a seat? Tell us what happened. You're gonna have to forgive us for the delay. It's a small town, you know? We came as quick as we could. Mm. Why don't you two walk us through what happened? Yeah. Uh, so, uh, earlier tonight someone came.. You know, it was a break-in. - A break-in? - Mm-hmm. Well, how did he get in? - It's she. - She? It was a woman. - We let her in by mistake. - Let her in? I... let her in. She had a car broken down and she asked if she could use the phone. So you let her walk in through the front door? Yeah. And then what? And then she attacked us. Yeah. Let's take it back a step. When the emergency call was made.. ...the attacker was still in the house? I... I made... I made the call. When, is the question. - M... my boyfriend came in.. - Your boyfriend? And he surprised her. And they started fighting. Him and this woman? Yeah, and then I... I got away. Was she a, uh.. ...big woman? - She.. Average? Yeah? - Average. Where is this boyfriend now? He's in the other room. - Could you go and get him out? - Yeah. Joseph! Could you come out here, please? - Officer.. - Sergeant Daniels. - Sergeant Daniels and.. - Officer Ramirez. Officer Ramirez, they have questions about tonight. So should I just go get him? - Well, hello there, sir. - How you doin'? How you doin'? Here he is. The hero. Yeah, this is Joseph, my boyfriend. So Ms. Estelle tells us that you had an altercation of sorts and you were able to chase off your visitor. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. - Um, yeah, he scared her off... - Uh.. I'd like to hear it from him. Well, uh, like Estelle said I, uh, I came out. And, uh, I saw what was happening and I... I charged her. You know? I didn't really know what else to do, so.. I thought that would, that would be the right thing to do. Um.. And then we... we threw some punches.. Punches? Well, I mean, not... not punches like boxing but, you know, we just wrestled. Yeah. No, and then I... I made the call and then she ran off. Yeah. The three of you live here? - We're visiting. - We rented for the weekend. A rental, huh? No kiddin'? It's nice. Thanks. Where y'all from? - Uh, New York.. - Los Angeles.. Well, we have, uh.. It's a.. We... we have a long distance relationship. Well, where does that leave you? Oh, sarge, that, uh.. You guys are here on a romantic getaway type of thing, huh? Yeah, it's modern times, buddy. Exactly. Yeah. Just the three of you, then, no one else? Just us. Yeah, just... just us three. I'm gonna have a word with my partner. Will you excuse me? Just a second. - Are you buyin' any of this? - Are you kidding me? What is the deal with these people? I think they're pretty fuckin' high. - You think? - That's just my guess. As a cop. So how do you wanna play this? So, where did she go when she ran away? Your... your attacker? Oh. Um, there was an old car on the street that she got into. Did you get a good look at the vehicle? Uh, I'm not really a car guy but it was an Oldsmobile maybe. - Brown, I think. - Yeah, mm-hmm. I'm not 100 percent sure now. A brown Oldsmobile? Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Like the one sittin' outside right now? What? That's not yours? No. No. So nobody is aware of the vehicle that's parked out in front of this property right now? Go and run the plates, could you? Yeah. Stop. Stop! Ah! Put the fuckin' weapon down! Put the fuckin' weapon down now! Put the fuckin' gun down! Put the.. Step away! You. Do not move! Alright. You two, step over here. I'm gonna secure the perimeter of this house. You three will stay put. Can you do that for me, Sarah? Estelle! - Yeah. - Yes, sir. - What's going on? - Jesus. What the fuck? - Oh, my God! - What the fuck? Estelle! Ah! Stop! What the fuck, man, stop! Stop! Ah! Shh, shh. Ah! Sarah? Estelle? - Is it stuck? - Yeah. Then what are we gonna do? We gotta go out the side door. Come on. Stay low. Ah! - Sarah! - Come on. No! Ah! Ah! Aah! Estelle. - Get up. - Ah! Wider. Wider. Alright, get her up. I think we got off on the wrong foot earlier. Wouldn't you agree? Why are you hurting us? Why? Hmm. The wrong place, the wrong time. We pillage and plunder and rip the flesh off our brothers and sisters. There's no moral order. There's just this. Can my violence conquer yours? I just wanna go home. Go and look for the photograph. Would you please? - I'll handle this. - Thank you. Those guys can be fucking animals, you know? The owners of this house took a photo. And those two monsters killed them before they gave it to us. Now, I have a less dramatic approach. Here's what we're gonna do. One of you.. ...is gonna be more cooperative than the other. Are we on the same page? What? Oh. Estelle. It's you. May I? Listen to me. Where are the pictures? I.. What are you talking about? There are so many pictures in this house we don't know what you mean! You'll have to think a little fuckin' harder! 'Cause you must've seen somethin'! Or you wouldn't have lied to me about my dead friend in the bathtub! We don't know anything! Naughty, naughty Estelle. There's somethin' about you I just can't put my finger on. Do you wanna know what it is? Would you like an example? Why did I find this man in your bedroom with a large poultry knife in his gut? Look at you. You look quite fond of him. And yet.. ...your lover boy came to an unfortunate end in a brave attempt to save your life tonight. Right? Sarah, forgive me. "Forgive me?" Oh. Oh. I think we have a little friction here. Is that what we have? So, where does that leave you? Please just let us go. You know what I think? I think we've stumbled onto a lover's quarrel. Has this young lady done something to hurt you? Hmm? Well.. We can't let her get away with that. We've got to do something. Go on, tell her how you feel. Ah! Get up! No, no. That way. Crawl. Crawl. Crawl. That's it. That's it. That's it. Now..
