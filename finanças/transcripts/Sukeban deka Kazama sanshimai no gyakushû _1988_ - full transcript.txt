Takanoha Gakuen High, Junior, Class B. Saki Asamiya... Also known as... Once a ruling Sukeban, fate has made me an agent for the cops. Laugh if you want to, see if I care. But remember... My soul isn't warped like yours! My face was hidden by an iron mask... for 17 long years. I don't even know anything about my own birth, but... ...by a twist of fate, I'm now an agent for the police. Sukeban Deka ||...Saki Asamiya... No way am I going to let you get away with this! Seiryu Gakuen High, Sophomore, Class B, Yui Kazama... Also known as... Sukeban Deka |||...Saki Asamiya! You in the shadows, wreaking havoc on this world... I'm going to make you pay! The era produced a terrifying group of heroines... The first girl fought to save her imprisoned mother. The second fought to unravel the secret of the iron mask that... ...stole away her youth. And the third... ...joined her two older sisters to take a stand against the forces of evil. These young female warriors became legendary... And they were known to the people as... SUKEBAN DEKA Counter Attack of the Kazama Sisters In 1988, the finest high school students in the nation were recruited to form... ...the Student Police Force. They were placed under the command of... ...the Juvenile Security Bureau to crack down on juvenile delinquency. Hey, my bike! Who the hell are you? I'm Yui Kazama... Student Cop! Anyone caught contributing to the delinquency of a minor will be exterminated. This way! This way! What did we do to deserve this? You're in violation of the Juvenile Security Bureau Provisional Ordinance. We've never even heard of it! Then you'd better remember it. We're the ones who keep the streets of Tokyo safe. You're full of crap! Don't hurt us... don't hurt us... You're the scum of the city. 1, Tohko Agawa, will show no mercy towards delinquents like you! What are you waiting for? Take them out right now, Yui! Dark Director, I can't take it anymore! I want you to take me out of the Juvenile Security Bureau Student Cop Unit... ...right this minute! They kick the crap out of anyone who's not a total straight arrow... ...the "Provisional Ordinance” is just a pretext! But you know what... I'm through. We all raise hell when we're under pressure... ...or just feel like doing something wild! But Tohko and the others... they've gone way beyond... ..."enforcing" ” the damned rules! At the request of the Attorney General... ...I sent you to the newly-founded Juvenile Security Bureau. As of then, you no longer work for me. Yui, If you have a problem with their policies, you're going to have to... ...keep that straight in your own mind. There is nothing I can do for you. All right, then. Just as you feared, sir... It seems that something dubious is going on in the Juvenile Security Bureau. I'm not surprised. It'll be better for us to have Yui there to keep an eye on things. The one I'm interested in is the man who runs the Juvenile Security Bureau... ...Chief Kurando Sekine... Kurando Sekine, currently a law student. He published a book, "The National Security System for the 21st Century.” Despite being a student, he's a sensation in international judicial academia. He's already working for the Ministry of Law and... ...has developed the Juvenile Security Bureau. It's been a month... 12 motorcycle gangs have been eradicated, 4 theft rings... ...6 blackmail rings, 5 dealers in stolen-goods... ...and a total of 18 incorrigible delinquents have been locked up! I'd call these results fairly respectable. I'd like you to redouble your efforts bolstering the security of the capital. Wait a minute! Wouldn't you say that what we're bolstering nothing but excessive violence? Listen, Yui Kazama... The first step towards absolute security is to instill a sense of morality... ...in our youths, and to deter them from engaging in unlawful activities. I've read your file. You've been dispatched 3 times, but you've refused to carry out your duties twice. I heard you tried to let off the delinquents you were supposed to purge! Are you perhaps not clear on what your duty is? - Listen, I... - Never mind. I don't need to hear it. The fact is you're confused... that's where you're wrong. There is no need to be confused. I myself shall grant you justice. Do you hear me? The power you wield is that of... Justice! So even if it's only for tonight... It's better than spending the night alone... Put on some new clothes tonight... Kyosuke, give us some bottles to sell, too. Let us do some dealing! Idiot! Don't worry, I'll find a way to keep you guys fed, all right? Kyosuke, I love you! Dummy! I don't want to sponge off you all the time. Come on, give me a bottle! - Don't get in over your head, okay? - Okay. Here. - Right, go to it! - Okay! Great! By tomorrow morning, I'll be alone again... Just give me back tonight... Hey, buy this! - Shut up! - Ouch! We are members of the Student Police Force. We've been informed that the Outcast League sells drugs in this concert hall. Therefore, we're shutting down this performance. We're also prepared to identify and charge all Outcast League members. Anyone who interferes will be exterminated, so keep that in mind! It's those damned Student Cops again! - Where are Jun and the others - Huh? Jun! You three are dead. This has gone too far! What did they do to deserve this? They're just little kids... why are you being so merciless with those yo-yos? Get out of here! Awesome! I like her! She's cool! Stop! Betraying us, are you? Kyosuke! Kyosuke! What do you think you're doing? Hurry up, get in! - Wait! - What? - That girl! - What girl? What are you talking about? Just get in the car! You've violated the code. You, the great Sukeban Deka! Violated the code my ass! This yo-yo... This insignia is for protecting students, remember? But look at you, using it as a weapon of brutality! I'm going to make you all pay! Yui! The moment you throw that yo-yo at one of us... ...you shall become a traitor. And that would truly bring shame on the cherry blossom insignia! I'm confused... I don't know what to do anymore. I can see I don't belong in this city anymore. Big Sisters Yuka and Yuma... you should come down to Kyushu to visit. This place is like heaven! Working at this farm everyday is the perfect life for me. The only thing I miss is seeing you two. I hope you'll come see me when school lets out. I'll take you horseback riding, okay? I really want to see you both... So promise me you'll come visit, okay? I'll be waiting for you! That Yui... A farm, huh? And horses... It's not really my thing, you know... the smell of the countryside. I guess city life wasn't for Yui, after all. I can picture how happy she must look. No choice but to pay her a visit, right, Big Sis? Listen to you! I know you're dying to see Yui. That's got nothing to do with it! I just... Hey, come on, just admit it! Kyushu, huh? Well, I guess a trip might be a good idea. But this is... Pitiful dog! Hello, this is the Kazama residence. Is that you, Mr. Yoda? What's wrong? Hello? Hello? Mr. Yoda! Are you still there? Yuka... Yuma... Oh, no! Quiet. They're still... Tell us what happened! It's been a long time. You shouldn't talk anymore. We'll get you to a hospital... Since you've retired... I didn't want to get you involved. But... but I just had to get this... You've got to get this to the Dark Director. All right. Don't worry about it. Yuka... Yuma... Are you happy now? Of course we are! What about Yui? We just got a letter from her. She's living on a farm in Kyushu. She says she's enjoying herself. Is she? I know I didn't do right by Yui. Assigning her to the Student Police Force... Yoda... Yoda! You're just playing, right? Yoda! Open your eyes! Yoda! Yoda! He's late. Yoda's late... Don't tell me Kurando Sekine got to him... What the hell is this? Kurando Sekine! Dark Director, we have reason to suspect you of treason against the state. Until you clear yourself, you shall be stripped of your post and authority.. ...and you shall be placed under the custody of the Juvenile Security Bureau. What are you talking about? You have no such authority! Within the next few days, we'll have all the evidence... ...regarding your plans to stage a coup d'etat. I'm sure that the Attorney General himself will be convinced by then. Now then, there's something one of your underlings stole from us. Would you be so kind as to return it to me? I see... So you have yet to collect it. In that case... Take him away! Is this how you operate? I think I'll just sit back and observe what you're trying to accomplish. Wait a minute, Tohko. At last the time has come for me to give you... all of you... ...a true command. Yui! Yui! You've got a call from Tokyo! Okay! It must be... my big sisters Yuka and Yuma! Hello? Hey! I knew it was you, Yuka! What? Mr. Yoda's dead? That's not all, either. When I called the Dark Director to tell him about Mr. Yoda... The Dark Director's organization has been shut down? What's going on? Where's the Dark Director? We have no idea. All we know is that something catastrophic is going on. Yui... what are you going to do? Yuma and I... ...we've decided to do whatever it takes... What the hell... what the hell happened? Kagoshima Airport Big Sister Yuka! Big Sister Yuma! What's the deal? Why are we meeting here? They ransacked our house. We're being shadowed. There's no place like Kyushu after all! The air's so fresh, and it's really warm... The best thing about it is that everything's so simple there. At the ranch, I have all these regular chores everyday... I have a routine. And I've got my own responsibilities as a member of the ranch. I feed the horses and keep their coats and stalls nice and clean. And the horses come to trust me as their friend. Animals are really sweet that way, you know... Look, this is no time to be talking about that stuff! Back in Kyushu, people don't distrust each other and... ...you never find yourself doing things that make you doubt yourself later. Where's all this B.S. coming from, anyway? But it's different here in Tokyo. People are always saying one thing and doing another! You believe you're doing the right thing at first... ...but then you find the rug's been pulled out from under you! I can't make sense of it anymore! That's what Tokyo is to me. And I wasn't ever going to come back here again. But now I have a feeling that was a mistake. Yui... The Dark Director's plan from the beginning was to... ...have me investigate the Juvenile Security Bureau. But I didn't realize that, and I... You shouldn't blame yourself. I never should've turned my back on him, just because I was confused. Isn't that so? I'm a failure as a Sukeban Deka! Hand over that floppy disk. I know Yoda gave it to you. We've done our homework, you know. And if we refuse? I'll bet there're tons of secrets about the Juvenile Security Bureau on that floppy. And we'll find out what's on it ourselves. Depending on what we find... Tohko... You really believe that the Juvenile Security Bureau's doing the right thing? I'm only going to ask you one more time. Give me that floppy! Answer me! I see it's not going to be any use trying to reason with you. As a Student Police Officer... I am hereby purging the 3 of you... the Kazama sisters! Our predecessors guarded the integrity of that cherry blossom insignia... ...no way am I gonna let you get away with abusing it like that! Yuma! Big Sister Yuma! Go! You've got to take that floppy disk and find out who they really are! - Yuma! - Big Sister Yuma! Yuma! Yuma! Big Sister Yuma! Yuma! Yui! Big Sister Yuka! Big Sister Yuka! Big Sister Yuka! Big Sister Yuka! Goddamn you! Just you wait... I'm going to get you for what you did to my sisters! Big Sister Yuka... Big Sister Yuma... - You guys, who are you? - You saved us the other day, remember? Oh... We saw them chasing you just now, and we headed you off. Nothing to worry about. Just follow us. Leave it to us, this is our turf. We use it all the time to rip people off. Ouch! That hurt! All right, I'm gonna trust you guys! Hey, could you wash these, too? Thanks! Rising crime has been a problem in the city. The government recently established the Juvenile Security Bureau. However, there were major terrorist attacks. Authorities are concerned. They're talking about the Juvenile Security Bureau. They can just go to hell! The explosion at the Jonan Police Department occurred two days ago. Yesterday, there was another blast at a power plant in the Kanto region. The Juvenile Security Bureau has apprehended a number of suspected... ...delinquent students and is in the process of interrogating them. So far, the suspects only have revealed that they are the... ...members of the Outcast League. For Christ sake... what do they mean, Outcast League? Hey, I guess it means we're famous now, huh? Kyosuke! You won't believe this! Hey, I know her! She's a member of the Student Cop force that's out to get us! - Let's kick her ass! - Yeah, come on! Kick her ass! Kick her ass! Kick her ass! Kick her ass! Stop it! Just hear us out, will you? Kick her ass! Kick her ass! Out of my way! Kick her ass! Kick her ass! Kick her ass! Kick her ass! Kick her ass! Kick her ass! Kyosuke! Hey, there's Kyosuke! You've got a lot of nerve, wandering in here like this. You're dead, bitch! You've got to save her! - She saved us the other day! - Come on! What a bunch of idiots! As if I'd let you take me out before I get the chance to avenge my sisters! What's with that Tohko... and now you morons... I've just about had it with you all! Stop it! Please, stop it! Why does it always turn out this way? Why should we hate each other like this? Why isn't anyone trying to find out the truth? Tell me why! I'm calling it off. I don't see you as my true enemy. Do whatever the hell you want! Hey, hold up! Stop it! I've got to get some crucial information out of her. Let me handle this. Goddamn you! Untie me! Untie me now, dammit! I want to know why you Student Cops have it in for us. If you break the law, you'll get punished. You asked for it! Yui Kazama, was it? Take a look. Those kids got kicked out of school and out of their homes. And I've taken them all under my wing. We have to do some slightly shady stuff to feed a household this size. We don't have any choice, see? Moron! Don't give me that crap when you're selling drugs! Those are nutritional supplements. Is it really such a crime to cheat a little bit? You think you're justified putting the smackdown on us like that? What you're doing is murder! Do you know how many of us got seriously injured? Some never made it back alive. I'm not talking about just 2 or 3 of us. And that's not all... You bastards even told the media we were committing terrorist attacks! Terrorism? What are you talking about? Man, don't give me that clueless act. This isn't an act! I've left the Bureau. They're not my comrades. Those bastards... they're my enemies! You used to be one of them. Why would you call them your enemies how? Because they're the ones who killed someone important to me. They took my sisters, too... Why'd they do that? I don't know. That's what I want to find out. What the hell? You don't know anything, either! Hey, do you happen to know the guy who runs the Juvenile Security Bureau? Of course I do. Then take me to him. Let's pin it all on the Boss, and make him resign. Like that's ever going to happen! Hey, I know it's a gamble. But I thought maybe we could do something together. I mean, our business isn't so lame. We could turn it into something really huge. And with the Juvenile Security Bureau on our side, then just think... ...how far we could expand! You really don't have a clue, do you? What did you say? Those people would never go for a nickel-and-dime scheme like that. Just leave it to me, will you? I swear I'll expose that Bureau! Don't you dare give me orders! You're a major pain in the ass, you know! And you're just a Kid! Who are you calling a kid? I'm 17 now... so that makes me a grownup! - I'm a lot more mature than you are, too. - You're nothing but a little Kid. I mean, I don't see any of the allure of a 17-year-old! Allure has nothing to with it, dammit! Peanut. - Moron. - Shut up! Now take me to the Bureau chief! No way. Status report? We detonated a bomb in the minister's car. His body has been found and confirmed. The subway explosion's also been carried out. There've been several hundred casualties. The entire city is in a frenzy. This should get those foot-draggers in the Cabinet moving. Good job. Look how heavily guarded it is. Then, call it off. What did you say, squirt? - Ouch! - What are you doing? Taking the sink-or-swim approach... I'm busting in there! This is what I mean when I say you're a squirt! This way! Now then, Dark Director... are you ready to sign your confession? "These acts of terrorism were part of my plot to overthrow the government.” "And toward that end, I used the Outcast League to do all the legwork.” Are you going to continue to murder... ...innocent people just to realize your own ambitions? You're insane! That's right. If you refuse to sign, you will be responsible for countless more deaths. You'll never succeed. I swear I'll never let you! That's quite a bark you have, old man. I've been informed that Yuka Kazama, who has the floppy disk... ...has been sighted along the shore. Go after her. Yes, sir. I'll kill you if you hurt my sister! Big Sister! Damn you for getting me involved in this! Yui! Big Sister... so you survived! Yui... Kurando Sekine! I'm onto you now. Justice, my ass. You're not gonna get away with this! Don't lose your head. - Yui! Get out of here! - Are you kidding me? If you don't run now, they're gonna take us all out! Yui, you're our last hope. Go! It's no good. We gotta run! Go! Yui! Hurry! - Big Sister Yuma! - Hurry! Kyosuke! Come back for us later. We'll be waiting! I'm coming back to save you no matter what. I swear I'll destroy the Juvenile Security Bureau! They're firing on us! Caught you off guard! My firecrackers got you! You idiot, who said you could come here? - You can gripe about it later. - Hurry! What the hell did we do to deserve this, anyway? I can't believe they'd frame us for their crimes! Kyosuke, I have a huge favor to ask of you. Take me to the shore. Kyosuke! Jeez, what am I, your chauffeur? It's my big sister Yuka! Hang on, guys! Get her! Hurry! - Big Sister Yuka! - Yui... So it's you again, Yui! You gotta be kidding me! You're a jinx after all! Come on, guys! Yui! This time I'm going to kill you for sure! This is how you throw a yo-yo! Hey! Come on, get on this boat! Hurry! All right, hang on tight! We're gonna turbo-jet right out of here, okay? Yui! Hey, guys, are you all right? Yeah! His name's Goro. He's the one who rescued me. Goro, thank you so much! Well, I'm a Yuka fan now. I'll do anything for you guys! Right. I'm so glad, Big Sister Yuka. Big Sister Yuma survived, too. She did? I'm going to save her no matter what. Here. Mr. Attorney General... It is no longer possible for the government to function normally.. ...in a secure environment. Were you able to get the Dark Director to divulge anything? No, sir, not a word so far. At any rate, this is not something that will just go away if we single... ...him out for condemnation. The fact is that even though we have him in custody... ...the enemy shows no sign of letting up. One way or another, I want you to thwart any further acts of terrorism. Otherwise, we may be forced into taking the most drastic of measures. I will do my best, sir. Right. Tohko, everything will be resolved by tomorrow. For that to happen, we need to get that floppy disk back by tomorrow. Tomorrow? That's right. Tomorrow's the day. Whether or not you'll be able to take your place among us as a ruler... ...tomorrow, all will become clear. Tomorrow will be the day of your last battle as Student Police Officers. Thanks! Make sure it's good, all right? Right! Those bastards will definitely be coming here to attack us. So, do the best job you can! I'm on your side, remember. As long as you believe in me... How's it going? Well, since it's a computer we picked up from the trash... Just give me a cool look of desire... Just give me a smile as tears fill your eyes... Pull your red leather jacket closer... As I hand you the bandana of love... In the falling rain, I'll hold you so gently... Showing some flash, playing it cool. It's the way I live my life... What a moron. Everyone's just afraid. That's right. What is it? A firecracker. Because I like you, Yui. I want you to have this. If you're ever in danger, just scare the Student Cops with this! Thanks. Yui... Tell me what you believe in... Huh? I believe in money. I've got to feed everyone. You can't blame me... Hey, you know what? I think you're pretty hot. Moron! Just outwardly, that is. That wasn't necessary. Those bastards... You really think they're out to Kill us? I don't think I'm gonna survive a battle like that. I mean, things turned out this way;, but I don't have what it takes. Come on, that's not true. Everybody's counting on you! You're a great leader, Kyosuke. You really think so? Yes, I do. Well, with you on my side, I might find the courage to do it. I don't know what it is about you... Showing some flash while I'm playing it cool... Moron! Peanut! How lame is that? It will be morning soon. Time to shift into high gear. This is our day! Got it! Strategic Plan to Establish JCIA. To create an underground state under the control of the... ...Juvenile Security Bureau... To trigger a state of emergency via staged terrorist attacks... So this is what they were plotting. They'd use terrorist attacks as a pretext to create a secret police force. Kanto region Tokyo 23rd District These are their attack plans. February 10, Jonan Police Department Bombing. February 11, Kanto Power Plant Bombing. February 12, Indiscriminate mass murder on subway. February 13, Assassination of key government official. That's all the stuff they've already carried out. What's the last target? February 14, West Hall St. Valentine Concert. Indiscriminate mass murder! Time of attack, 2 PM. Row G, Seat 20... that's where the bomb's going off. Hey, that's today. And we've only got 3 hours! Yes? This is West Hall. What? A bomb? Enough with the pranks! There's no bomb here! - What did he say? - That they didn't find any bomb. That's not possible! All the other data on that disk was accurate. Look at this! Plan B, to be implemented in the event of data leak... Revised strategy for setting off explosion... Blank. Kyosuke! - Kyosuke! - What's up? They're here! Damn you! Did you know what was going down when you helped them? I see, so you've managed to read what's on that floppy. We've got you completely surrounded. I want you to hand over both the floppy and Yui! If you do, I won't charge you as suspects in the terrorist attacks. What do you say, Kyosuke Bando? I can't believe you'd do something so low. Tohko! Fight me fair and square! Yui... You'll put down that yo-yo and turn yourself in, along with that floppy. Those are my conditions. Tohko... If you don't meet my demands, we'll kill you all. Even those little kids there. None of you will be spared. I'll give you time to think it over. In 15 minutes, it'll be 10 o'clock. Your deadline's 10 o'clock. Understand? What's there to think about? Do you really believe that girl would ever keep her promise? All she wants to do is to take you into custody, and get that floppy! She knows it would be easy to take you all out if Yui wasn't here. Kyosuke, you wouldn't hand Yui to those student cops, would you? But the way things are now, we don't have a chance of surviving. That girl's human, too, after all. She just might keep her promise. I don't see why you don't get it! It's so simple! We're talking about people who carried out this evil plot! What's it going to be, Kyosuke? Kyosuke! Would you mind going? Yui? What about the people at that concert? Are you going to stop them from carrying out their plan? It has nothing to do with us. We don't have to power to fight it. Yes, you do. If you put your mind to it... Haven't you forgotten something? We're the Outcast League. Just a bunch of social rejects... All we're want is a little corner of the world to live in peacefully. Don't get us involved in your fight. You're gonna let them make a loser out of you? All right, it's clear to me now. I won't let you go! If you go now... Big Sister... it's all right. Even if they take me into custody now, I swear I'll find a way. I want you to stay here and think up a way to stop them. Yui... Kyosuke... I've just made up my mind. I'm going to fight as a Sukeban Deka to the end! You want to know why? Because I've come to care about everyone here. You, Jun... And you, Kei... and you, Taro... All of you! That's why... That's why I don't want them to turn you into losers! Nobody had to give me this assignment... I am a Sukeban Deka! - Yui! - Stop. Kyosuke, I'm so disappointed in you! How could you? Yui! Yuka... Yui! Yui! As soon as Yui comes through the school gate... Kill her. Yui! Yui! Let's fight! Mobile Reserve Corps, engage! Purge them all! - Kyosuke! - Yui! Dammit! Get back! Get back! Goro! Goro! Goro! I've got a fast yo-yo. No way... The Boomerang Crane... controlled by the way its wings are folded. Kyosuke! As long as they've got that tank, we don't have a chance! - Can you bait them into coming closer? - What are you planning to do? - Just leave it to me! - I'm gonna trust you on this! Everybody, follow me! Guys, I want you to go hide in the back! Kyosuke! Get out of the way! Yui! Big Sister Yuka! We're running out of time. I know. Yui, the concert... But, we don't know what their plan is. Our only option is to break into the Bureau! We've got to capture Kurando and find out how to stop the detonation. That sounds like a plan. Yui, give me that floppy. I'll be sure to get this to the Attorney General. Just leave the rest to us. Don't worry, you've got us. Go save the people at the concert! Yui! Leave it to me. Kurando! Yui! Look at this! So this is the concert... Only 15 minutes left. How are they planning to bomb this place? Let's start looking. Find some kind of clue! I'm so close... I won't let you get in my way. I'll protect these people! I won't let you. I'll kill you first! Goddamn you, bitch! Out of our way! Kyosuke! Kyosuke! Kyosuke! Shit! Shit! Sukeban Deka |||...Yui Kazama. Also known as Saki Asamiya! Tohko Agawa... There's no justice in what you are doing! Why should you rule over others? I won't let that happen! I'm sick to death of that crap! You really think you have what it takes to kill me? Is that the best you can do, Sukeban Deka? Shut the hell up!! Big Sister Yuma's... Die! If you're ever in danger, just scare the Student Cops with this! The anger of the downtrodden... let's see if you can take it! Kyosuke! I'm fine. We've got to do something about the concert. "They're going to use rockets to blow up the concert venue.” Where's this? It's the airport! So, they're gonna fire a rocket from a plane. We're out of time, Yui. That's it. We've got to ask them to take us there. Where's the passenger? Oh, that must be her, right? Be careful. Okay. Listen, thanks. Hey, thank you. Yui... Peanut! Yui! Be careful... I mean it! Kyosuke! Get yourself to the hospital, and have them fix that wound! So you're going to frame us for blowing up the concert and kill us? Such low tactics. Stop the car! Don't mess with the Great Yuma of the Knitting Needles! Big Sister Yuma! Dark Director! Don't worry, we're fine. I knew you'd be coming for us. Sukeban Deka Yui Kazama! Pursue that man! - Where's Kurando? - I don't know! Liar! I swear, I don't know! Goddamned Sukeban... Are you ever going to get out of my way? But it's over now. Everything will be decided by this flight. I'm not going to lose here. It's not because I was appointed by the Dark Director... I chose to become a Sukeban Deka myself! I'll die before I lose to that bastard! Goddammit... Die! I made you go through a lot, didn't I? Yui... I guess I was an underachiever as a Sukeban Deka until the end. I don't think you're going to need this anymore. Dark Director... I guess it's goodbye. Big Sister... Yui... Yui... Yuka... Yuma... Farewell... Sukeban Deka Ill! We all hurt each other, and learn how to dream... We're not angels. There are things you never see unless you're down... That's youth... Instead of learning how to hold back my tears... ...I'd rather discover what this moment's all about. Believe again... Now's your chance to grow stronger... ...since there's nothing to lose. That's why you should try again. Just start walking forward again. Because someday your dreams will come true. Believe again... I want to fill my soul with a fresh breeze. So you should breathe again... It's so important to believe... ...that a painful night won't last for long. The End
