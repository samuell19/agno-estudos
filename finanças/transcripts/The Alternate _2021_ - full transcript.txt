All right, that looks good. We'll be happy? Yeah. OK, let's make a movie. Isaac, roll sound. Sound speed. Rolling on B camera and rolling on A camera. All right, Alex, you're feeling good? Do you have any questions before we get started? No, I think I'm good. Awesome. So tell us about how your team was able to get re-upped to the place it's at today. Let me tell you a little bit about how this all came about. I spent years putting in the time, but so did my peers, and where are they? I faced the question, was I going to be ordinary or great? Great, of course. But I'm here to tell you, you have to be the cobra. You have to strike. You have to grab that moment. You know, you might think that you only get one chance at success, but if you miss out on something, I'm telling you, don't give up. That next opportunity, it's out there, buzzing around just like bees at a picnic. Our team accomplished amazing things, but it doesn't mean anything if you don't react. Sometimes it comes down to just one moment. What's that? What's what? So people ask me, why haven't I achieved my goals, and I tell them stay focused, maybe the opportunity you need hasn't hit yet. Hey, come here. That right there. Is there a problem guys? We got to cut. Yeah, yeah, cut. Cutting. How much longer is this going to take? You guys having, uh, camera problems? Thank you. Thank you. No, we have it covered, thanks. Hey, this is going to take a minute to troubleshoot. Sorry, Alex. Larry, walk with me. Yeah, so that last test was pretty close. Still there? Yeah. Hey, maybe it's the sensor. I really hope it's not the sensor. Better? No, maybe we should cycle power. Are we ready? Alex has a meeting at 10:00? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we should be good. All right. OK, that was it. It's gone. It's fucking weird. Huh? We should be ready to go. Let's do this. Sound? Sound speed. Camera? Camera rolling. Action. Is this what you dreamed about in film school? Huh? Talking head interviews? Fuck no. I thought I'd be working in CVS. This, this is way fucking better, right? Tell me, how long have you been working for Alex again? Have you ever thought about asking him to invest in your movie, Space Drive... Just lay off, OK? OK, guys, great work. I got to go. Come on, after half a beer. I have to work on Space Drive. I thought it was done. The short is. I'm working on the feature now, Peter. OK, for what? You're going to pitch it to Sony? You got a meeting at Sony. He's being an asshole. Look, if you had some kind of plan to approach Alex once the script was done, then... Peter, you don't know what... Hey, guys we all got to be on set today, right? So how was your shoot? It was good, I guess. What happened? Everything OK? Nothing happened. It's just another stupid corporate shoot. I'm sorry, honey, I can't be your cheerleader tonight. Look, I had a tough day. I believe in you, I just can't... Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I know. It was just hard. Either go for it or don't. So you're saying I should quit. I'm saying I want to read my book. Just keep at it, you'll get there. You know what would really help? Darling, I love you. I need you. I can't live without you. Work sucked today. Can we try tomorrow? But you're cute. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess I'll get some work done. Don't stay up too late. Yup. Yup. Yup. Yup. Uh, fuck it. I faced the question, was I going to be ordinary or great? Great of course. Do you have time for breakfast, angel? No. Can I take it to go? Yup, I'm already ahead of you. You were up late. You're working on your movie? No, no, no, no, I was just loading footage. Talking to Alex. You know, that man never says thank you. Every time he finish a shoot, he just kind of walks... Well, better than my slave job. I'd kill to have your cushy job. Excuse me? Cushy? Well, look, not cushy but let's not forget I used to sell eyeglasses too. Perfect. I'll just tell Stevie you want to take my shifts so I can stay home and jerk off all day. Hey, hey, listen... Just don't forget one of these days, you're going to have to pick up the slack. I'm sorry. Look, I appreciate all you do for us. I'm doing it for you, Jake. I got to go, I'm going to miss my bus. Hey, I love you. I'm sorry, angel. It's fine. Bye. Hey, what's up, Peter? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm almost done with the edit. You are? All right, let's see what you got. I didn't get too far with it. Just... just hit play. OK. I spent years putting in the time, but so did my peers, and where are they? I faced the question, was I going to be... That's it? That's a good start, yeah? Fuck dude, isn't this due tomorrow? Yeah. Yeah, I know, but check this out. Remember that spec from the shoot? I blew it up and created this from that dot. Pretty cool, right? Yeah. Yeah, real cool, Jake. Shit! Dude, are you OK? You're dressed in a fucking rob for fuck's sake. I'm totally fine. Fuck it. I know that you're trying to get this Space Drive stuff out there. I know this, but what about your reputation? My reputation with who? Alex? You like money, right? Huh? Yes, yes? Yeah. OK. OK, well, then take this shit seriously. If you miss an opportunity, that could be it, you fail. But I will tell you this, the best opportunities, they only come around once in a lifetime. That's what I'm talking about, nicely done. You didn't have to hold my hand. Yeah, well, if we didn't finish it now, you'd call me at 12:00 AM looking for notes, so. Thanks for the pep talk. Sure. Maybe I should just get a 9:00 to 5:00, make movies on the side. You in an office? You'd be fired in a day, Jake. I mean, Jesus, just turn that shit in ASAP, OK? Yeah, I'm sure they'll love it. But seriously, this is cool, right? Yeah, you're a fucking genius. You know, if you put in that much effort on Space Drive, you'd have a feature to show up right now, all right? Huh? Office job fucking robe. I love this fucking rob. Later. Asshole. Shit! Come on, out with it. What's up? All right, I can't even explain it. I have to show you. Work was tough today, can I just get 30 minutes? This is the most incredible thing you've ever seen. I mean, you won't even believe it. Jake, do you respect me? What? You don't seem to think that my job is anything special, and it's not... I'm sorry about this morning, OK? But Space Drive really needs to be done. Space Drive wouldn't exist without my crummy job. How much did that movie cost? Spending the money on the movie was huge, but, at least, I waited until we got married. We didn't even have a wedding. I know, we made a movie. You made a movie. Come on, Jake. You know, I want to design my eye-wear line. When do I get to do that? Also, when we have a family, it can't be like this when we do it. So what? You're not ready to have kids? I am ready to have kids, I just need to go part-time first. I just need to. How am I supposed to write my... I told Stevie that I want to work three days a week, so you're going to have to pick up more gigs. Please don't make a big deal out of this, OK? How can I not make a big deal about this? You said that I have a year, and now you're telling me otherwise. Weren't you supposed to have shot your feature by now? But no, you just put out the short two months ago and that hasn't changed much. So because I didn't get into Sundance or South by Southwest, I'm some sort of failure, huh? Is that what you're saying? Well, you can still work on your script, you just need to work too. You had something you wanted to show me? You know what? Apparently, I have a lot of work to do. You were up late last night. Yeah. Yeah, I just... Look, I'm sorry I dumped that on you. I really need to show you something. When do you leave? Right now. I do want to see this thing. Show me tonight? Whoa, can you call in sick or be late? Are you kidding, it can't wait? No, no, this thing... this thing is... well, it's so cool. I love you crazy, man. Go get some work done and you can show me when I get home, OK? OK. I love you too. Can you talk? No. Look, I'm shooting. What is it? It's this thing. It's just... Is it the job? Did you find a glitch? No, no, no. I just I... it's just this thing, I... Look, man, I got to go. Just figure out whatever it is and call me later. Jake, is that you? Jake? What are you doing here? Hi, honey, what are you doing? I thought you were at work. I just got in. I wanted to work from home. What are you doing down there? Nothing. I just go home. Are you seriously playing a game right now? Don't you have work? Yeah, I just had a tough morning, I thought I'd turn up for a little bit. I didn't think you had time for these things anymore. Yeah, I guess I just missed them. OK, have fun. And don't forget to pick Julie up on time. Oh, no problem. And send a text if you plan on hiding in your office. You scared me. Sorry, angel. Angel? That's an old one. Later, weirdo. Well, let's see what we've got here. Jake? Are you expecting someone? Holy shit. Kris, what... are you OK? How did you get out of your office? What are you doing with the bat? You were just in your office. No, I just got here. Is everything OK? Excuse me, I'm running really late. Thank you, sir. Have a good night. Sorry, ma'am, how can I help you? My contact should be here right now. Kris, will you answer the phone? I'm so sorry she kept you waiting. This is Kris, how can I help? Kris. Kris, it's Jake. Honey, now is not a good time. Kris, you won't believe it. I saw you. You came to the office? No, no, it's the thing I've been trying to show you. Just listen... Jake, I got to go. It's crazy busy. No, no, just leave. Kris. Kris, just leave. Go home. OK, bye. No, no. No, no, no, Kris, Kris... Thanks for calling. Kris. Kris, Kris. Ow, fuck. Angel, let's go. How was work? Exhausting. What's for dinner? Dinner? Forget dinner. You're not going to want to eat when you see... Please, for the love of god, order some food. I'm going to take a shower. OK, Jake, what's up? What's more important than food, sex, and anything else? OK, cool trick. How did you do that? Come on, here. Check it out. What the fuck? It's a portal, angel. To where? You want to see? No. No? It's a portal? You've been in it? Yes. It's totally safe. You OK? Where the fuck are we? This is our house, angel. I'm getting out of here. It's gone. You mean we're stuck here? No. No, no, no. No, look, I got it with me, we can go back. Don't worry. That's me and you. What is this? I think it's like another version of our life. What? What are you saying? I don't know like another reality, I think. Look, I made my movie. Is this our daughter? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Uh, Christ, this is wrong. We shouldn't be here. We can't be parents. Well, we figured it out somehow. We didn't figure anything out. Shit, they're home. Who's home? We are. This place has the best Chinese food. You really outdid yourself this time, two orders of potstickers. I know they're your favorite. Did you get extra dipping sauce? Whose wife do you think I am? You are the best. Time to go. Isn't this the most amazing thing? Are you feeling better? Why aren't you excited? I just discovered that other dimensions exist, and we can travel to them. Shut up, I'm thinking. God, this is like the biggest scientific discovery of all time and you're not even excited for me. Discovery? You're not a scientist. You stumbled onto this thing that you don't understand and what? You're going to win a Nobel Prize? Great. So what's your big idea, huh? What does this mean for us? I don't know, nothing. We need to call someone. Call someone like who? The police? What can they do? Shoot it? Not the police, Jake. What are you looking at? Scientists, some sort of agency. I'm trying to figure this crazy shit out. Well, maybe we don't need some fancy scientists, why don't we do it? Why don't we do what? What are we going to do? I don't know. Maybe we could do it together. Didn't you fail physics? So you're saying I'm not smart enough? Really? Yeah, yeah, that's it, isn't it? It's just when have you ever done anything even close to this? When has anyone done anything like this ever? OK, Mr. I know everything, what do you want to do? I don't know. Maybe we should go through it again. OK, I can't deal with this right now. Well, come on, let's figure this out. I just think we shouldn't mess with it until we do some research. So you don't want me to go down there? You can do whatever, I just need to take a bath and read my book. Hey, you never know. There is something I wanted to ask you about. Anything. Hit me. Is there something that you need to tell me? Anything that you haven't brought up that's going on? Like what? With work or one of my movies? No, like personally. I mean, is there anyone you've been spending too much time with? You mean like, Peter? No, like... like another woman. I heard from Carla. You really don't trust me? I do, but... Don't listen to what people say. Yeah, but I mean... What Krissy? What about the other day? Are you serious? It's just so weird. You were tired, right? You were working on the new design. It was a dream, right? But you were there. You were playing with one of your pinball machines. You know, I don't play those stupid things, especially with the shoot coming up. Yeah, I know. Are you sure you still love your crazy wife? You and Julie are all I need. Well, I think I've discovered a portal to another dimension. It's oval ish, it spins slowly. There's like colors swirling. Gather all the information, pictures, videos, anything about this portal and send Have a good day. Anything good? No, just another portal. Crazy. The truth is out there. Yeah. Yeah, it really is an amazing opportunity. I'm really excited to go back out there despite the freezing cold to make another movie like this. Yeah, just like the thing. Almost. It really is going to be hard to be away from Julie and Kris, but I'll be back before they even knew I was gone. OK, Jerry, Jerry, I really got to get back to my workout. Chao. All right, 10 more. Don't give up, ass hole. Yeah. Yeah, Peter, I know. It's so crazy. Jake? Shit, shit. Shit, shit. Yeah, I'm right with you. We won't let Linda Hertijivas in on this. Shit, shit. shit. Jake, where are you going? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Jake, come back. I got to run. Ciao. Yeah. What's up, Krissy? Were you just wearing that shirt? Yeah, this is the shirt I went to work with. Who were you talking to right now? Oh, work. Go for a swim? Yeah. Ah, fuck. Jake? Is that you? Of course, it's me. I just shaved. In the middle of the night? I couldn't sleep. The sweat from my beard. Do you like it? Have you been in the portal? What? No. No, no, no. No, of course, not. No. You look like him. Haven't felt my face in years. Yeah, weird. You scared me, and I miss the beard. But you look OK. Yeah? I mean, you don't hate me? No, I don't hate you. But are you taking this portal thing more seriously? Well, I haven't told you yet but I spoke to a science lab yesterday. Shut up. Mm-hmm. Why didn't you tell me? Well, they obviously don't believe me, but they gave me an email to send the info to. That's great, Jake. I told you, I was taking this seriously. So you're going to send out the email today? Hmm, mm-hmm. With pictures, and a video file? Yes. Yes, of course. I love you. Hey, there, Mr. Oh, hey, angel. What is going on? Are you going to burn those clothes or something? I... I'll take those. You're being bad. Aren't you supposed to be prepping? Yeah, yeah, I know. I was taking a break but now I'm going to get back to work. Do you really have to? I just dropped Julia off at her sleepover, and it's our last night together for weeks. At least, let me dry you off. OK. Kris? Kris? Hey, baby. Happy sexy dreams. Always. What the fuck? Uh, wait, uh... I... I can smell me on you. No, no, no, no, no. It was you. Oh, was it? Don't even... Kris. Kris? Kris? Fuck. Kris. Kris. Kris. Hey. Wake up, Mr. Sex all night, man. Morning, Krissy. That was amazing. Yeah, you're always amazing. I know it's going to be hard being gone, but just relax, enjoy your last day with us. Yeah, maybe. The fuck? What's going on, Jake? I thought I... What is it? Are you OK? Yeah. Yeah, I just... I thought I saw someone. I think you're just stressed. I'm stressed too. I'm going to miss you. Sorry, I have to go. Don't worry about it. You just bring something amazing back for Julie. Like what? An ice cube? All right, remember, you won't hear from me until I'm headed to base camp. Yes, I know. No communication. If anything were to happen. Faction will contact me. I'm going to miss you. OK, time to go. Love you, bye. See you. Eh, flip it. Ah, ah, good job. OK, how about... deal, 1 minute and then you come over here, deal? So you get to choose one toy that gets to read a book with us. How about one for me? That's fine. Mama, do you love me? Yes, I do dear one. How much? Jesus Christ, Jake. What's going on? What happened to your shoot? I was going to surprise you, the whole thing got postponed. Why didn't you call? Well, our flight got delayed, and then we got a call, call at 5:00 AM, and they said that the shoot was getting pushed back because of finances. Yeah. Oh, that's a little odd. That's never happened before. Yeah. You know, we were just having trouble with the people we were working with, and so they just needed time to figure it out. I see. So when do you have to go back? They didn't say. It could be soon, but it might take a while. Well, maybe finally we'll get to spend some time together. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that'd be cool. This is nice. You feel nice. I thought it'd be nice to make us dinner if I can just get this thing to work. Wow, I've never seen you fumble with that thing before. Yeah. Got it. Where's your wedding ring? Oh, I forgot to tell you, I left it at the airport. Well, I lost it at the airport, I've been pulling off luggage. I ordered a new one, it's OK. When are we getting Julie? No, it's fine. Not a big deal. Actually, I have a surprise. Oh yeah? I asked Suzanne if Julie could sleep over so the night is ours. Honey, the grill. Oh shit. So what are you going to do? What? Now that you have a few free weeks. Are you going to direct that short? Do you need the tongs? No, no. I mean. Has it been that long since you grilled? Yeah, I mean, I just thought that I would take some time for myself. What? Well, and you and Julie too. What? What? I just feel like I work so hard all the time, and yeah, I never really get to spend time with you. Wow, I need to sit down. OK, Julie, time to get out now. OK, mama. Let's dry you off, young lady. But I like being wet. I know. But you can't go to bed wet. Can I answer the phone? No, Julie, brush your teeth. Hey, Jake, can you get my phone? I got it. Who is it? Julie, you got to brush your teeth. I'm brushing, mama. Kris, it's your husband, I was hoping I'd hear your voice. I'll be home in two days. I love you, Krissy. Give Julie a hug for me. Good night and sweet dreams. Hey, honey. Who was it? It was just a survey. What for? They want to know how you think the president is doing. Everything all right with my phone? Yeah. Yeah. It was nice seeing Julie finally beat you. It's no fun if you never win. OK, don't just stand there, come on, let's get this little lady to bed. Sounds good. Julie, are you done brushing your teeth? No, I was waiting for you. Fuck! How's the new computer working? Oh, it's great. I still think the old one was fine. Yeah, but this one is much faster. So what have you been up to today? Well, actually, I've been working on a brand new script based on that game, Power Glove. A video game movie? Mm-hmm. Really? Yeah. Did you run this by Jerry? Yeah, Jerry. Right, yeah. Yeah, he loves it. I'm surprised he's not freaking out that you're on vacation right now. Yeah, he's cool. There is one thing that I want to do for you and Julie before I get to work. What is it? It's a surprise. A surprise? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Can I have the house for one night just to set it up, please? You don't have to do things like that. Save the surprises for Julie. No, really. Just give me one night, you'll love it. Really? You can stay at Carla's, right? It's not that, it's just... Please. Will you do it for me? One night, and it better be good. I like sleeping in my bed. Thanks, angel. You'll love it. Kris. Julie? You home? Who are you? I'm you. What? What? Are you fucking insane? Shit! Who the hell are you? I'm you. What the fuck is going on? Why are you in my house? I'm calling the cops, OK? Kris? Kris? Kris? Kris? Fuck. Peter, is that you? What is going on, man? I don't... Look, I don't... I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah. My place, OK. OK. I love you, man. Pete. Pete. Christ, it's good to see you. Well, what the fuck is this? I called you about 80 times, man. Where the fuck were you? You got to fill me in. I don't know what's happening. Where's my house? This is your house. Well, I mean, not anymore. Kris moved out when you left her. What the fuck are you talking about? I just got here, wherever the hell this is. Oh, you're going to swear to me now? Huh? Do you have any idea what you put her through? Put me through? Fuck this. You know I'm... No, hey Peter. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, Peter, I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry Hey, hey, Peter, come on. Please, hey. Hey, stop. OK. Give me something. OK. OK. Here's exactly what I remember. I came home to my real house with the remodel led driveway and the pool. You don't own this house. What? I mean, you and Kris wanted to buy it, but you never could get the money together. Jesus Christ, what happened? OK, just... OK, you're in your make believe house then what happened? I was attacked when I got home. He had my face. He said I was him. I was knocked out, and then... And then I woke up here. OK, sure. You don't believe me. Well. He pushed me... he pushed me through like this portal thing. Yes, it was swirling like a screen saver. Screensaver? Yeah, yeah, something like that. You showed me a screen saver during the last jobs. I didn't show you anything. You showed me this fucking visual you made. I don't know. I made it? Well, Jake... Jake made it if that's... man, if that's who you are. Yes. Yes, that is who I am. I'm Jake Del Rio, damn it. Well, Jake Del Rio, he doesn't own no house. He can barely afford to pay his own bills. Huh? What did Kris say about me? Not much. I mean, she said you left her for another woman. I mean, you were gone. Does that sound like me? I don't know. Man, I had to hire another camera up. He left me for another woman, it was enough. I mean, what do you expect? Something's going on here, man. Did you call, Kris? No, she won't answer. You call her? Look, just get in the fucking car. Yeah. You sure you can't stay? Man, this is weird shit. Don't call me again, whoever you are. Yeah? Yes? Kris. Fuck off. I don't know how I got here. You remember cheating on me? What? How could I do that? Who are you? What happened to your head? I was attacked by someone who... I can't even explain it. You're him, right? I'm Jake Del Rio. Yes, but you aren't my Jake. What does that mean? You, the other you created this thing, this portal. Other me. So that's who that... It was a fluke, we traveled through it to another world. To another version of our house, a nicer one. That's my house. You were there. I've only been there once. But Jake, the other Jake, he kept going back. But where is it? It's like another world. All I remember is being attacked by the other me, and then being pushed into this empty office. He created this video file, somehow it turns into a portal. What the fuck? How do you even do that? I don't know. But he... he was cheating on me with her. With who? With... With the other me, Kris. I caught him coming out of the portal naked. How could she do that? I'm sure she thought it was you. How could I do that? So now what? Where is that portal? I sold the equipment. It's gone. It's gone? That portal ended my marriage. So what? I'm stuck here? I sold it to a cash and trade place. Well, let's go. I'm not going anywhere. Why not? You ruined my life. He did, not me. What do you want from me? He's pretending to be me right now. Do you want him to get away with this? OK. How can I help? I have 150. That's all I have. Thanks, Krissy. I'm sorry. Can I help you? Yeah, yeah, a woman recently sold you a bunch of video. Ah, so you're the cheating asshole. Do you still have it? Yup. Follow me. I just need the computer equipment. Hold your horses. I just got the thing to turn on. Yeah, this is what I need. Can I test it? Go nuts. What the fuck? So you want it or not? How much for just this? The monitor? Hold on. So I got cabbage, I got eggplant. What else you need, man? Who was that? You OK, slick? What? I said the computer and the projector come to $850, that's it. $150, that's all I have. You got anything to trade? No, no, I don't have anything... Is that gold? Maybe. Just relax, let me take a look. You're cheating ass might be in luck. I didn't cheat. You sell rings too? I buy all kinds of things. Looks good. See, things do work out sometimes, hey, slick. Hey, honey. Dinner will be ready at 6:00, does that work? Sounds good, angel. 100,000, 200,000, 300,000, 400,000500,000. And her shoes are on. But make sure you knot them tight, dad. That way they won't fall off. How are your kids doing over there? We'll be there in just a minute. But I wanted to wear my blue shirt. You like white too, don't you? No. Well, you look great. Go sit at the table, Julie, I'll be there in a sec. Can we have pancake for breakfast? Sorry, kiddos, we're having eggs and toast for breakfast. Doesn't that smell yummy? Can I have some ketchup? Just a little, OK? You promised. OK. Julie, what did I just say? But daddy puts way more on his. Can you tell your daughter to use less ketchup. What's the big deal? There's a ton of sugar and salt in that junk. It's unhealthy. Come on, she likes it. It wouldn't be a big deal if we got the one with no high fructose. Uh, the organic stuff tastes weird, it's got to be the normal stuff. Don't you like it little, lady? I wish you wouldn't do this, Jake. I'm sorry, I like ketchup so much. We got to leave in 10. You almost done, sweetie? Yup, I am. Julie, finish your eggs. No more ketchup, young lady. But, mama. Dad, back me up here. Why are you so worked up over this? Later, Jake. Can you help me with the dishes. No, no, I'll do them when I get home. I got that meeting today about Paula. Shit! Jake, watch your mouth. I forgot to finish my treatment. Just give me a hand. It'll... Mm-mm, it's due in an hour. You have tons of time, help me out. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'll clean up my mess after my meeting. Jake, don't leave me with this. Jake? Are you seriously not going to help me here? What's going on down there? Kris, I'll be up in a sec. Oh. Oh. What are you doing down there? Angel, get help, there's an intruder. No. You're going back. That's not me. Kris. What the fuck is going on here? Kris, I know this is hard to understand but that man is not your husband. You're going back to that fucking thing. Kris, get the bat. Krissy, get Julie and call the police. I'm never going back. We can work this up, we can switch days with her. Date night is yours. Let him go. Kris. Kris, it's me, Jake. But you've been here. No, I was working. I came home and he attacked me. What? You and Julie, you weren't home. This thing, this thing is some sort of portal. This can't be real. Good job distracting him, angel. Help me grab his legs. Why would you do that? I'm protecting you. No, It's been you ever since the trip. What are you talking about, angel? It's why you've been acting so different. Why you've been around. I'm giving you what you need. Who are you? This is for b... No. Oh my god.
