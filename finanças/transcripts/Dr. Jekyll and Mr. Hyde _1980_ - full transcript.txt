DR. HENRY JEKYLL: I, Dr. Henry Jekyll, MD, Fellow of the Royal Society, am about to record, for posterity and in the interests of science, the day-by-day details of the bold experiments which I am currently undertaking. I have long been absorbed with the duality of man, the good and the evil housed in a single body, with myself as as good an example as any. If the twin sides of my nature could be separated, then the unjust could go its own way without disgracing its more upright twin, and I could be left to do the good works to which I have dedicated my life. And I believe that I am on the brink of decocting an amalgam based on opium derivatives and the alkaloid from South American mescal made soluble in ether which, when mixed in the right proportions, will both prove my thesis and bring peace of mind to myself and to all mankind. [WIND HOWLING] [DOG BARKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [WATER RUNNING] [DISTANT CONVERSATION] [LAUGHTER] HASTIE LANYON: Oh, my goodness, me. Is that the time? Look at that. OLIVER UTTERSON: Oh, goodness. HASTIE LANYON: Henry, it's almost the witching hour. Need a steady hand tomorrow. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Ladies and gentlemen-- [SHUSHING] --ladies and gentlemen, well, no long speeches. That's for sure. [CHUCKLING] Well, as you all know, we are gathered here this evening to celebrate the inauguration of the Coggeshall Trust-- named, as I'm sure you all know, after your late husband, Mrs. Coggeshall, who was an indefatigable fighter for social reform in the House of Commons. HASTIE LANYON: Hear, hear. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: So I think it's only fitting that our president should bring this evening's proceedings to a close. [APPLAUSE] ANN COGGESHALL: Dear friends, when Jack-- [CLEARING THROAT] --was killed in South Africa, I realized at once that the only fitting memorial to him should be the formation of this trust to continue his fight for social reform. And although he would have been delighted to see its founder members gathered here this evening and to thank you all for your most generous contributions and support, I know he would have wanted us to force the authorities to admit that not more than 10 minutes away from this comfortable room there live families who share their rotting houses with rats, typhoid, and cholera. And, now, we must thank Mr. Utterson who is to help us with all legal matters. [APPLAUSE] OLIVER UTTERSON: At your service, Mrs. Coggeshall. ANN COGGESHALL: And the help of our eminent surgeon Mr. Lanyon to diagnose a disease and cut through any red tape. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Hear, hear. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Hear, hear. [APPLAUSE] ANN COGGESHALL: And Dear Dr. Jekyll, not only for allowing us to me in his house, but also for his dedication to the cause of pulling down the slums and building houses fit for Englishman to live in. HASTIE LANYON: Hear, hear. [APPLAUSE] DR. HENRY JEKYLL: I sometimes think Mrs. Coggeshall could do it all by herself. ANN COGGESHALL: Oh, if I could, I would. [CHUCKLING] So, thank you, one and all. [APPLAUSE] So there we are. [APPLAUSE] Oh and, Hastie, the subcommittee for penal reform is meeting next Monday. I have arranged for the governor of Newgate to show us over the prison. Now you won't forget, will you? HASTIE LANYON: Absolutely not. ANN COGGESHALL: Oh, good. JANET: Making a move, Mr. Poole. POOLE: Oh. Gwen? HASTIE LANYON: Good night, Poole. POOLE: Mr. Lanyon. [CHATTER] DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Jack would have been very proud of you tonight, Anne. ANN COGGESHALL: Dear, Henry. [CHATTER] [DARK MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR CLOSING] [DARK MUSIC CONTINUES] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] GIRL: Please, sir, you feeling good natured? [UPBEAT MUSIC CONTINUES] GIRL: Please, sir. Please. [CHATTER] WHORE: Hello, Charlie. Are you feeling good-natured? [CHATTER] DOLLYMOP: Good evening, Sir. I'm a dollymop. Only just started. [LAUGHTER] ARGYLL PIMP: Now, look, Sir. I know where I can find a real fresh student, a country girl, none of your fake virgins. KATE WINTERTON: Well, if it isn't old gloomy Gus. How are you, my squaring friend? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Evening, Mrs. Winterton. KATE WINTERTON: You didn't look in last week, Gus. Was you poorly? Or on the randy at some [INAUDIBLE],, eh? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: I was extremely busy, actually. KATE WINTERTON: Oh. He was extremely busy. Haha. You, uh, looking for Fifi and Diana, are you? Well, they're upstairs waiting for you, Duck, all on their tod, the little angels. Champagne, Gus? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, I'll wait until I come down. Thank you, Mrs. Winterton. KATE WINTERTON: Well, then you go on up and get your dues, [INAUDIBLE]. [CHATTER] [SCREAM] WHORE: Well, where have you been? WHORE: Yeah. You gave us a miss last week, didn't you? Come in proper, darling. WHORE: Do you want a [INAUDIBLE] gin? I hope you're feeling good-natured, Charlie. WHORE: Well, now, Darlin', who's been a naughty little boy then? [MUSIC AND CHATTER] [COUGHING] [COUGHING] DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Why is it that I feel such an abysmal sense of shame? Is it that I've set myself to a higher standard of conduct? Or did my father set it for me with bedtime warnings of hellfire? Yet, each side of my duality is in deadly earnest. Well, I'm as much myself when I'm plunged into the depths of shame as I am when I'm alleviating pain or administering to the sick. [SHOUTING] [WHISTLE BLOWING AND SCREAMING CONTINUES] PRISON GOVERNOR: I'm sorry about that. ANN COGGESHALL: About what exactly? PRISON GOVERNOR: He is a reprieved murdered. OLIVER UTTERSON: Oh, dear. God have mercy, I should said. ANN COGGESHALL: But, as he says, where is he? HASTIE LANYON: A free man, I presume. PRISON GOVERNOR: Good heavens no, Mr. Lanyon. Broadmoor for life. Now, Mrs. Coggeshall, I would like to show you the needlepoint that some of our prisoners are occupying their spare time with. [CLEARING THROAT] HASTIE LANYON: Poor chap. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Aye. But basically a good man, you see, if only the evil in him could be isolated. OLIVER UTTERSON: Oh no. Hastie, what do you think? HASTIE LANYON: I think Henry's taking advantage of the occasion to thrust his scientific balderdash down our throats. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: My dear Hastie, we all know that you're a very brilliant surgeon. But your speciality is the area between your knife and your patients' flesh, not in extending the bones of scientific knowledge. HASTIE LANYON: Well, he was the same at university. Do you remember, Oliver? Always had a bee in his bonnet and hoping it would sting everybody else. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Yes, but do you not see the tremendous release that could be achieved if the good and the evil could be separated? Hmm? OLIVER UTTERSON: How do you propose to achieve that, eh? Surely we can all recognize the difference between good and evil, huh? HASTIE LANYON: Well, not Henry. He refuses to believe that man is a hodgepodge of both and woman, too, with all due respect to Mrs. Coggeshall. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: I fail to see why you are so flippant about the enormous amount of research I've put into this over the years. HASTIE LANYON: Oh, come, man. Don't be so pompous-- DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Oh, it's pompous, is it, Hastie? HASTIE LANYON: Yes. You are pompous. OLIVER UTTERSON: Now, now, Ha-- Hastie, Henry, come on, now. Easy, now. Easy, eh? Easy. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, when my research is completed, Hastie, I promise you that you will be the first to pass judgment. [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Hastie's skepticism works on me like a red rag to a bull. [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] C10 H9 OCH3 brackets 2OH brackets NCH brackets 3 plus the final solution from my chemist. [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Bufotenin, two grains. Mescal, one grain. [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Now, my conviction that man is not truly one but truly two is to be put to the test yet again. [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPS] [FOOTSTEPS] [DARK MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR OPENING] [DOOR CLOSING] [DARK MUSIC CONTINUES] [DOOR OPENING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [DARK MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPS] [HORSE FOOTSTEPS] [MAN LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] WHORE: Hello, Charlie. MAN: Hey, Governor? Governor? Copper for a cup of tea, Sir? [CHATTER AND MUSIC PLAYING] MR. EDWARD HYDE: Well, put the basket down, girl. Put it down. Hey, you're shaky. MARY: Yes, Sir. MR. EDWARD HYDE: But why? MARY: I'm frightened, Sir. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Well, do I frighten you? Do I? MARY: No, Sir. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Well, what frightens you then? MARY: I don't know, Sir. MR. EDWARD HYDE: How old are you? MARY: 14, Sir. MR. EDWARD HYDE: 14, eh? And what do you do? What's your speciality? MARY: Pardon, Sir? MR. EDWARD HYDE: What's your speciality? What do you do? MARY: I'm a flower seller, Sir. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Ah, no, no, no-- not a flower seller, surely. MARY: Truly, Sir. MR. EDWARD HYDE: You're a common harlot, aren't you? MARY: No, Sir! MR. EDWARD HYDE: Then why do you bring strange men back here? Hm? MARY: Because I need the money, Sir. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Not enough in selling mistletoe, eh? MARY: No. And I've been ill. MR. EDWARD HYDE: You think I'm a fool, don't you, to be taken in by a story like that? MARY: It's true, Sir. I don't do it often, only when I need the money. MR. EDWARD HYDE: What's your name? MARY: Mary, Sir. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Well, Mary, now you take off all your clothes, and I'll tell you what I'm going to do to you. [HORSE FOOTSTEPS] [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [CLEARING THROAT] DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, as I believe you all know, I serve on a committee concerned with social welfare and housing reform presided over by Mrs. Coggeshall. [SNICKERING] Well, connected with these activities is a certain Mr. Edward Hyde. Oh, I'm so sorry, Cook. Please sit down. COOK: Thank you, Sir. My feet. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Now, Mr. Hyde is to have the run of the house, including the laboratory to which he will have a key. Is that understood? POOLE: Yes, Dr. Jekyll, quite understood. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: He will also have the use of the spare room should he need it. I should, however, point out that, um, Mr. Hyde is a man of a somewhat strange personage. And I would, therefore, advise you to, uh-- are you listening to me, Janet? JANET: Yes, Dr. Jekyll. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: I would not like to think that you were not listening to me. Well, as I was saying, I would advise you to, uh-- well, just keep out of his way as much as possible. All right. Thank you very much. That'll be all. Is it not a little early to be drinking claret, Oliver? OLIVER UTTERSON: A straight answer. No. [CHUCKLING] DR. HENRY JEKYLL: I had no idea that you were a connoisseur. OLIVER UTTERSON: Eh, we all have our hobbies. Yours is a scientific experiment. Hastie's is bumbling about the universe-- DR. HENRY JEKYLL: That is hardly a hobby. It has been my life's work. OLIVER UTTERSON: Yes, of course, Henry. I bet your pardon. I would not offend your susceptibilities for all the world, not in this day, eh, this day of all days. [CHUCKLING] The acids in this were long ago dissolved. The imperial dye will have softened with time. And the color there has grown richer as it does with stained glass windows. And now the glow of hot autumn afternoons on hillside vineyards is ready to be set free. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Aye, a touch of the poet, I see. OLIVER UTTERSON: Mmm. Now then, Henry. Your new will. Proceed. [CLEARING THROAT] DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, in the event of my decease, apart from the normal bequests to my servants, all of my possessions are to pass into the hands of my good friend, Edward Hyde. OLIVER UTTERSON: A moment here, Henry. A Last Will and Testament, you'd assure one that the testator is of sound mind. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Do you doubt it? OLIVER UTTERSON: Frankly and with all due respect, yes. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: And your reasons? OLIVER UTTERSON: I've known you for thirty years, and I've never heard mention of an Edward Hyde. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: I said he was a good friend, Oliver, not an old friend. OLIVER UTTERSON: Yea but to leave the bulk of your estate-- and your, by no means, a poor man-- can you not tell me something about this gentleman? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Nothing, except that he is a good friend, and he has the run of my house, should he need it. OLIVER UTTERSON: The run of your house? No, no, no. Very well, I stand here as your lawyer, not for me to reason why. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Mmm, good. OLIVER UTTERSON: At the same time, how shall I put it, Henry? I've been hoping that perhaps this friendship with Ann Coggeshall would develop into a more lasting relationship. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Supposing it does-- OLIVER UTTERSON: And if the two of you should wed, to leave everything to a comparative stranger? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: There is a further clause, Oliver, but I fear that you'll approve of it even less. OLIVER UTTERSON: Indeed. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: In the event that I should disappear-- OLIVER UTTERSON: Disappear? Would that be into thin air, Henry? Oh, dear. And visit some other form of prestidigitation? [GROWL] DR. HENRY JEKYLL: I'm making a simple bequest, Oliver, that, in the event that I should disappear or there is an unexplained absence exceeding three calendar months, then the said Edward Hyde-- are you getting this down, Oliver? OLIVER UTTERSON: No, Henry, I'm not getting it down. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, I have never seen so sensible a man become so agitated over so simple a matter. OLIVER UTTERSON: Now, Henry, you know me. You make a clean breast of it, whatever it is, and I daresay I can help you out of it. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Yes, but that is because you do not understand my position. OLIVER UTTERSON: Because you will not tell me what it is. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Please, Oliver, I promise you that I can be rid of Edward Hyde whenever I choose, hm? OLIVER UTTERSON: Very well. I shall incline the Cain's heresy. I'll let my brother go to the devil in his own way, and you can proceed. and you can proceed. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Thank you. His address is 15 West Dean Street. And I beg you not to broach the subject again. [WRITING] Oliver? I beg you.

How you doing? All right? [MEN TALKING OUTSIDE] MR. EDWARD HYDE: Be careful with that table, damn you. It cost a small fortune. MRS. WILLOUGHBY: Begging your pardon, Mr. Hyde. The tailor's boy has just brought these now. MR. EDWARD HYDE: That's good. Thank you. Give them to me. MRS. WILLOUGHBY: He says t'others will be along tomorrow, Sir. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Thank you. Now get out, and go downstairs, and stay in your own quarters. MRS. WILLOUGHBY: Yes, Sir. Thank you kindly, Sir. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Thank you. Thank you. [DOG BARKING] OLIVER UTTERSON: I must apologize for bringing you here under false pretenses. It is not for the purpose of a committee meeting. I am using your consulting room, Hastie, to ask you and Mrs. Coggeshall a question. Who is Mr. Hyde? HASTIE LANYON: Hyde? Well, I don't think I know the name. ANN COGGESHALL: Why? Should we? OLIVER UTTERSON: According to Henry Jekyll, he's a friend and protege of his, yet we have never set eyes on him so far as we know. HASTIE LANYON: Well, I don't see much of Henry socially anymore. The last time, Mrs. Coggeshall, he nearly snapped my head off. ANN COGGESHALL: Yes, I have noticed a-- what would you call it-- a certain preoccupation in his manner lately. HASTIE LANYON: In my opinion, he give himself a nervous breakdown. He'll end up non compos mentis. OLIVER UTTERSON: Eh. You think it's madness? I begin to fear-- I-- I begin to fear-- [DARK MUSIC PLAYING] --uh, how shall I put it-- but it's, oh, some disgrace or the ghost of some old sin. HASTIE LANYON: Now there speaks the voice of John Calvin. [NERVOUS SIGH] ANN COGGESHALL: It could be over work. Apart from his practice, all those experiments and then the work for our committee. Oh, if I thought it would do any good, I'd-- OLIVER UTTERSON: Yes, Mrs. Coggeshall? ANN COGGESHALL: I could go and pay him a visit, try and persuade him to take things a little more easily. OLIVER UTTERSON: Oh, I-- I think that's an excellent idea, don't you, Hastie? HASTIE LANYON: Certainly no harm in it. He's very fond of you. ANN COGGESHALL: Oh, I used to think so. OLIVER UTTERSON: Oh, but he is. He is. Hastie and I have often thought that you and he would make a-- oh, make a perfect couple. [LAUGHING] That's neither here nor there. [CHUCKLING] ANN COGGESHALL: Very well. I'll pay him a visit. It shouldn't be too hard to find some excuse. [CHUCKLING] POOLE: Good afternoon, Mrs. Coggeshall. ANN COGGESHALL: Good afternoon, Poole. Is Dr. Jekyll in? POOLE: I believe he's in the laboratory, ma'am. ANN COGGESHALL: I know he doesn't like to be disturbed, but would you tell him I'm here? I have one or two important matters to discuss with him. POOLE: Certainly, Madam. Oh, Mr. Hyde, sir, is Dr. Jekyll in the laboratory? MR. EDWARD HYDE: No, he's just gone out. Why? POOLE: Mrs. Coggeshall wanted a word with him. MR. EDWARD HYDE: May I be of any help, Madam? My name is Edward Hyde. ANN COGGESHALL: Thank you, Mr. Hyde. But I can call another time. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Uh, I'm his assistant in the laboratory. ANN COGGESHALL: You must find it very interesting work. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Oh, indeed, I do, Madam, utterly absorbing. Now, good day, Madam. I hope we see each other again. ANN COGGESHALL: Good day. Tell me, Poole, that cane that Mr. Hyde was carrying, the one with the silver knob-- POOLE: Yes, Madam. ANN COGGESHALL: Isn't that, Dr. Jekyll's? POOLE: Yes, Madam, but the doctor has made it very clear that Mr. Hyde is to have the run of the house. ANN COGGESHALL: How long have you been working for Dr. Jekyll, Poole? POOLE: Over 15 years, Madam. ANN COGGESHALL: Until a few weeks ago, have you ever seen Mr. Hyde before? POOLE: No, Madam, never. Have you, Madam? ANN COGGESHALL: No, I haven't. [MUSIC PLAYING] [TURNING CLOCK] JANET: You wanted me, Mr. Poole? POOLE: Oh, yes, Janet. The doctor has informed me that he'll be out for the remainder of the evening, so I think it would be a good opportunity for you to put the laboratory to rights. JANET: Very good, Mr. Poole. POOLE: Just a light dusting and sweeping the hearth, mind. Be careful not to tamper with any of the equipment. JANET: No, Mr. Poole. POOLE: Very well. Get along. JANET: Yes, Mr. Poole. [GASP] MR. EDWARD HYDE: Did you know that the Cobra-- the Cobra is a large and very poisonous snake? Did you know that a Cobra can hypnotize an animal 10 times its own size just by staring at it like I'm staring at you now and then devour it? JANET: Well, I-- I didn't see nobody was in here. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Do you have dreams, Janet? It is Janet, is it not, Dr. Jekyll's pretty little housemaid? JANET: Yes, Sir. MR. EDWARD HYDE: And you know who I am, do you not? JANET: Yes, Sir. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Who am I? JANET: Mr. Hyde, Sir. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Mr. Edward Hyde. JANET: Yes, Sir. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Well, say it, girl. JANET: Mr. Edward Hyde, Sir. MR. EDWARD HYDE: So now, again, Janet, do you have dreams? JANET: I suppose, Sir, sometimes. MR. EDWARD HYDE: And of what do you dream? Strong young men lying under hedge rows, wondering hands, endless kisses? JANET: I don't know. Can I go now, please? MR. EDWARD HYDE: You were looking at the bottles on those shelves, weren't you, Janet? JANET: Yes, Sir, but I didn't touch nothing. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Now that seems a pity because did you know that, on those shelves, there is a remedy for every ailment? Hm? There are potions there to cure heart aches, heartburn, simple influenza, the pain of broken bones and of broken hearts. JANET: May I go now, please? MR. EDWARD HYDE: Potions to make dreams become reality. Hm? Take this one, for instance. Now you do read, do you not? JANET: No, Sir, I can't. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Well, I'll show you. D-R-E-A-M-S. Dreams. [CHUCKLE] Now, we shall each take three of these-- JANET: (LOUDLY) No, Sir, please! MR. EDWARD HYDE: Janet, when you were disobedient, have you ever had your dress and your petticoats pulled up and been beaten-- beaten until you scream, have you? JANET: When I was little. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Well, we do not want that, do we? So we shall both take these tablets, shall we not, and find a sweet and a beautiful paradise. Now, now, very soon the drudgery of the day will be forgotten. [CHUCKLING] All that waking up at 5:30 in the foggy morning-- All that waking up at 5:30 in the foggy morning-- hmm-- trudging from the top of the house to the scullery, toting coal scuttles to every room, blocking grates, lighting fires all forgotten when you dream. [CHUCKLING] You are a princess. [LAUGHING] You ride in a golden carriage, and you wear pearls and diamonds in your hair. And crowds. All of the onlookers, they cheer as you pass. And you give them a radiant smile, hmm? [CHUCKLING] [LAUGHING] You wave at them with a white-gloved hand. [LAUGHING] And nothing, nobody, not even God himself can interfere with your dreams. JANET: I feel-- I don't know. [LAUGHING] MR. EDWARD HYDE: Here. [CHUCKLE] Very soon a strong, young man arrives. Hm. JANET: M-hm. MR. EDWARD HYDE: And desire floods over you like the falls of Niagara. But all your doubts, all your fears are dissolving. JANET: It's your eyes-- I know who they belong to. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Well, you can conjure up any fantasy that your innocent heart desires. ANN COGGESHALL: I only fuss because we're all so worried about you. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: There's no need. There is no need. ANN COGGESHALL: Are you being looked after properly? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: I have always looked after myself. ANN COGGESHALL: But locking yourself away in your laboratory night after night, even with an assistant to help you-- [SIGH] DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Yes, I believe you met Mr. Hyde. ANN COGGESHALL: Very briefly. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: And what did you think of him? ANN COGGESHALL: He seemed quite polite. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Good-looking, did you think? ANN COGGESHALL: Yes, I suppose so, quite good-looking. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Mighty attractive, eh? ANN COGGESHALL: Oh, for heaven's sake, Henry! What is it that Hyde has to do with this? Look, I know there is something wrong. You don't look at me anymore, or kiss my hand, or pay me the smallest compliments. Please tell me. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Perhaps one day, Ann. For the moment, I think it would be better if you went home. ANN COGGESHALL: Of course. Of course. But, please, if there is anything I can do to help, will you let-- [HORSE FOOTSTEPS] [DARK MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPPED] [BIRDS CHIRPING] JANET: It's half past 7, Dr. Jekyll. [DOOR CLOSING] [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [CHUCKLING] [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC CONTINUES] [QUARRELLING] JANET: I've done nothing. COOK: You've done plenty, my girl, making up stories the like of what I've never heard of! JANET: I'm telling you, he did it. [CRYING] DR. HENRY JEKYLL (VOICEOVER): There can be no doubt. Last night, I went to bed as Henry Jekyll, and this morning I awoke as Edward Hyde. No draft was taken, no explanation, except is the balance of my nature overthrown? Am I losing hold of my better self, sacrificed to the evil side? POOLE: Out Janet. Out! JANET: No [CRYING] COOK: You're trying to put something over on us. JANET: No, it's God's truth. He gave me something to drink. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: What exactly is going on? POOLE: I beg your pardon, Sir. I had no idea you were already at work. COOK: Uh, yes. Beg pardon, Sir. POOLE: It is a rather urgent domestic matter, Sir. COOK: It's Janet, here, Sir. POOLE: I have dismissed her from your employee, Sir. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Janet, go inside the house, please, and wait until you're called. JANET: Yes, Sir. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, what seems to be the trouble? Cook? COOK: Well, Sir, Janet says that she was, well, interfered with. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: I see. Well, go on. POOLE: On account of you being out the other day, Sir, I took the opportunity of instructing her to put your laboratory to rights. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: And? COOK: She said that Mr. Hyde was in there and, well, gave her some pills to take that made her feel-- well, then-- POOLE: Cook and I taxed her for details, but she says she can't recall very much. COOK: I said, well, that's blackmail, my girl. But she said, no, it wasn't. POOLE: Since she could give no satisfactory account of herself, I told her that she should go upstairs and pack her grip and that she would be given two weeks wages. COOK: But she wouldn't get no references. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Mmm. I see. However, do you not think that, under the circumstances, you might have been a trifle harsh with the girl? COOK: She's no better than she should be, Sir. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: How many of us are, Cook? COOK: I mean, is it likely that a friend of yours would do a thing like that, Sir? POOLE: Might I suggest that you have a word with the girl yourself, Sir? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: No, I have no wish to-- to disturb the domestic arrangements. to disturb the domestic arrangements. But if you want my opinion, I think we should give the girl another chance. That is, if-- if she wishes to stay. POOLE: Just as you say, Sir, of course. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: And that's what I do say. In the mean time, I will have a word with Mr. Hyde and talk to him about the girl's story. COOK: Very good, Sir. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Thank you, Poole. You were quite right to come and tell me. POOLE: Thank you very much, Sir. COOK: If you ask me, Sir, you're a sight too soft-hearted. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Thank you very much, Cook. POOLE: And your breakfast is served, Sir. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: I shall go up directly, Poole. Thank you. So now I have to choose-- Edward Hyde in a life of sensual delight, yet ending up friendless and despised or follow the path of righteousness set down by my father. In memory of him, I shall choose my better self. [DARK MUSIC PLAYING] Dear God, give me the strength that by dedicating myself to good works and the healing of the sick, Edward Hyde may abandon me once and for all. Amen. [DARK MUSIC PLAYING] Ah. There we are then, old lad, well, you drink that up, eh, and you'll be as right as rain. Oh, you don't fancy it, eh? Well, I can't say I blame you. MOTHER: Now you drink it up, lovey, like the doctor said. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll take a little sip first, eh, just to see how it tastes, hm? OK. Mm. Well, that's not too bad at all. That's not too bad at all. Go on-- MOTHER: Come on, lovey. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: There. That's not so bad, is it? Eh? There's a good lad. OK. Well, you take him home to bed. He'll be restless for a couple of nights, and then the fever will break, and he'll perspire. MOTHER: He'll what, Sir? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Oh, he'll sweat it out. But don't worry. Just let him stay in bed for another 24 hours. Keep him on a light diet. MOTHER: Thank you, Sir. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Come here, little lad. MOTHER: Oh, Sir, about-- DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Oh, no, no, no, no. It's a Saturday. We, uh-- we never accept money on a Saturday. Good night, little lad. [DOOR CLOSING] HASTIE LANYON: By the way, Henry, whatever became of, um-- that man that you were so worried about, Oliver? [DARK MUSIC PLAYING] OLIVER UTTERSON: Mr. Hyde. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Oh, Hyde. He Left rather unexpectedly. We shan't hear of him again. ANN COGGESHALL: Well, my dears, I think it's time we set out for this evening's little excursion. OLIVER UTTERSON: Oh, you know, Ann, sometimes I'd OLIVER UTTERSON: Oh, you know, Ann, sometimes I'd be prepared to take your word for the condition of these places, get to my bed at the usual hour. ANN COGGESHALL: No, no. We must all see for ourselves. There will be hope of gaining reform on mere here-say. We need eyewitness reports from important people like yourselves. OLIVER UTTERSON: And where's our destination, dear, tonight? ANN COGGESHALL: First, I thought we'd visit a lighthouse, which is comparatively reputable. For they're going down to Whitechapel, which is definitely not. It's unbelievable. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Which particular light house did you have in mind? ANN COGGESHALL: The Argyle, I thought. I've struck up an acquaintanceship with the owner. [DARK MUSIC PLAYING] WHORE: Hello, Charlie. Are you feeling good-natured? HASTIE LANYON: Yes, my dear. I think that you could call me that. Come along, Henry. Don't drag your heels. [CLAPPING, MUSIC, AND LAUGHTER] KATE WINTERTON: Good evening, Mrs. Coggeshall, and a very good evening to you, gentlemen. ANN COGGESHALL: Good evening, Mrs. Winterton. KATE WINTERTON: I see you have your committee in tow. ANN COGGESHALL: That's right. May I introduce Mr.-- KATE WINTERTON: Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-- no monikers, if you don't mind. Rule number one here, no monikers. But we're very pleased to see you, ain't we, girls? WHORES: Very pleased, Mrs. Winterton. KATE WINTERTON: Look around you, Mrs. Coggeshall. Only champagne, Moselle, or [INAUDIBLE] sold here. And I don't allow no lushingtons nor troublemakers, neither, nor [INAUDIBLE] harlots. Cherub, bring us four glasses. This is no slap-bang or suck-crib, I can assure you. ANN COGGESHALL: No, no, no. Of course not. KATE WINTERTON: It is a respectable place of rendezvous. Reputable. So when you talk to the reformers, you just tell them that Kate Winterton does nothing but what caters to the natural appetite. I enjoy sitting here like our dear queen, god bless her, watching by London for [INAUDIBLE].. Nobody does nothing nobody don't want to do. Would you gentlemen care to see the upstairs? ANN COGGESHALL: Oh, that's very kind of you, Mrs. Winterton. But I don't think we have the time. We have another protocol to make this evening. KATE WINTERTON: Oh, I'm very pleased to hear it, Dear. Get out and see the real [INAUDIBLE] streets. Filth and misery in the devil's acre. Take a gander at the rookeries around St. John's. The crimps and muchers, and the glimmed a-bags what uses a wall to do their trade up against. Begging your pardon, dear. Do you know that many of my girls here tonight are pretty horsebreakers and ride in Rotten Row of a Sunday? And can't be told from the real [INAUDIBLE].. What's more most of them are sailing on their own bottoms-- no pimps or ponces, no brothels but a cozy, little villa in St. John's wood. HASTIE LANYON: In St. John's wood? KATE WINTERTON: Well, you see, Dear, the carriage ride is just the beginning of the fun. Ain't that so, girls? WHORES: Yes, Mrs. Winterton. KATE WINTERTON: Darlings, ain't they? ANN COGGESHALL: Yes, well, thank you, Mrs. Winterton. HASTIE LANYON: And you must be congratulated on being so frank. KATE WINTERTON: Oh, I'll be Frank, Grandpa, or anybody else for a bit of fun. [LAUGHTER] Eh, heave-ho me hearties! A little matter of 12 dinars for the bubbly. Nothing comes free at The Argyle. Ta, lovey. And watch your fogles, gents, going up the alley. And watch your fogles, gents, going up the alley. [LAUGHTER] [BABY CRYING] [LAUGHTER] WOMAN: Try a change of luck, Dearie. [CREEPY LAUGHTER] [BABY CRYING] ANN COGGESHALL: It's all connected, don't you see? It's all connected. OLIVER UTTERSON: Ah, the stench. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: [INAUDIBLE] of the country. HASTIE LANYON: Surely you said that-- that all this was going to be demolished. ANN COGGESHALL: Make way for a new road, not for new houses. [FIRE POPPING] HASTIE LANYON: For the first time in my life, I find it difficult to believe that these two feet of mine are planted on British soil. [FIRE POPPING] [GIRL CRYING OUT] [QUARRELING] [SOBBING] [QUARRELLING] [AUDIO PLAYBACK] DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Hastie's skepticism works on me like a red rag to a bull. C10 H9 OCH3 brackets 2OH brackets NCH brackets 3 plus-- [END AUDIO PLAYBACK] ANN COGGESHALL: I won't be long. POOLE: Good morning, Mrs. Coggeshall. ANN COGGESHALL: Good morning, Poole. Am I going to be lucky today? POOLE: I'm afraid not, Madam. ANN COGGESHALL: Oh. POOLE: The doctor still insists that he is not to be disturbed when he is in his laboratory. ANN COGGESHALL: Oh, but I understood that-- POOLE: Yes, Madam? And there is another matter which I think you should be acquainted with. [FOOTSTEPS] MR. EDWARD HYDE: Ah, Mrs. Coggeshall, what a pleasant surprise. ANN COGGESHALL: But I thought that-- MR. EDWARD HYDE: That I'd abandoned my own friend, Jekyll? ANN COGGESHALL: No, that he'd abandoned those particular experiments. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Well, he had. But the temptation was too great for him, so he has gone back to them. And he cannot do without me. Good day. [HORSE FOOTSTEPS] [DOG BARKING] [DISTANT CHATTER] [KNOCK ON DOOR] MR. EDWARD HYDE: Come in. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Come in. Come in. MRS. WILLOUGHBY: The [INAUDIBLE],, Sir. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Mrs. Coggeshall. How very pleasant to see you here. ANN COGGESHALL: I'm glad you agreed to my coming. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Well, it would have been boorish of me to refuse a request from such a charming woman. Mrs. Willoughby, we do not wish to be disturbed. MRS. WILLOUGHBY: Oh, that goes without saying, Sir. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Of course it does. Of course it does. May I take your wrap? ANN COGGESHALL: Thank you. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Please be seated, Mrs. Coggeshall. ANN COGGESHALL: Mr. Hyde, I've come to ask you a question. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Well, I'm quite sure that I can answer it equally well if you were seated, my dear. ANN COGGESHALL: Very well. Now that you are working again with Dr. Jekyll, might I ask if it is still part of the same experiment. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Yes, the duality of man, totally fascinating. ANN COGGESHALL: Can you tell me what that means exactly? MR. EDWARD HYDE: Whether or not it is possible to isolate the evil in man from the good. Glass of Madeira, Mrs. Coggeshall? ANN COGGESHALL: Oh, thank you. No. I seldom drink. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Yes. I have heard that you're a woman of strict principles. But since we are both some distance from Henry Jekyll, I thought that we might relax our guards for a few moments. [EXHALE] ANN COGGESHALL: Not quite sure I understand you, Mr. Hyde. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Oh, I'm quite sure you do, Mrs. Coggeshall. However much one may admire Henry or even love him, there is no denying that he is inclined to pomposity-- ANN COGGESHALL: Oh, I didn't come here-- MR. EDWARD HYDE: --or even frigidity. ANN COGGESHALL: You're being insulting. MR. EDWARD HYDE: No. I'm merely pointing out that he and I are very different people. I believe that man was given senses to be used and enjoyed. He believes in original sin and in mortifying the flesh. ANN COGGESHALL: He is a good man. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Oh, indeed. Indeed. But what do you feel when he comes into a room, hm, when he is near you, or when he kisses your hands? ANN COGGESHALL: Mr. Hyde, I came here to ask you questions, not to answer yours. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Yes. Yes, of course, at your request. I was just hoping that our meeting might take place in a more relaxed atmosphere. ANN COGGESHALL: I'd hoped so, too. MR. EDWARD HYDE: A glass of Madeira then? ANN COGGESHALL: Yes, please, a small glass. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Madeira glasses are small. ANN COGGESHALL: Mr. Hyde, do you know that Dr. Jekyll and I are engaged to be married? MR. EDWARD HYDE: Yes. I believe he did say something of the sort. ANN COGGESHALL: Why should these experiments that we speak of keep him so preoccupied that he can find no time to see me? MR. EDWARD HYDE: Well, when a man's mind is firmly fixed on one thing, Mrs. Coggeshall, you know how it is. ANN COGGESHALL: Thank you. What can one do to help? MR. EDWARD HYDE: Well, since you are engaged to be married, it hardly seems proper of me to make a suggestion. ANN COGGESHALL: It strikes me that you are not very interested in proprieties, Mr. Hyde. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Not very, no. How do you find the Madeira? ANN COGGESHALL: Very pleasant. The duality of man-- MR. EDWARD HYDE: And of woman, possibly. ANN COGGESHALL: Is Dr. Jekyll working on that, too, the duality of woman? MR. EDWARD HYDE: No, Mrs. Coggeshall. I am. GROUP: (SINGING) God, rest ye merry gentlemen. There's nothing you dismay. Remember Christ our savior was born on Christmas Day to save us from Satan's power when we were gone astray. And his tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy. And his tidings of comfort and joy. [HORSE FOOTSTEPS] [SINGING CONTINUES] KATE WINTERTON: Many of my girls here tonight are pretty horsebreakers, and ride in Rotten Row of a Sunday, and can't be told from the real [INAUDIBLE].. [SINGING CONTINUES] [MUSIC PLAYING] Evening, Evening, Sir. Are you feeling good-natured? [MUSIC PLAYING] MALE PROSTITUTE: The money, please, Governor. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Money, you snippy little bum boy, get. MALE PROSTITUTE: No, Governor. Fair is fair, Governor. SIR DANVERS CAREW: You there! Stop that! What the devil do you think you're doing? MR. EDWARD HYDE: You mind your own business. SIR DANVERS CAREW: You deliberately kicked the lad when he was on the ground. MR. EDWARD HYDE: It was an accident. SIR DANVERS CAREW: Accident be damned. It was a deliberate piece of brutality. MR. EDWARD HYDE: You get out of my way. SIR DANVERS CAREW: Not until you have given me your name and address. MR. EDWARD HYDE: I certainly shall do nothing of the sort. SIR DANVERS CAREW: I happen to be a magistrate of this-- MR. EDWARD HYDE: Yes, and I happen to be an extremely short-tempered man, Sir. [CALLING OUT] [GROANING] [CHATTER] MAN: Come on. Come on. INSPECTOR NEWCOMEN: It's Sir Danvers Carew, Sir. I recognize him. OLIVER UTTERSON: Uh, yes, Inspector. INSPECTOR NEWCOMEN: And you say you recognized the assailant? JANET: [WHISPERING] POOLE: Speak up, girl. JANET: It was Mr. Hyde, Sir. OLIVER UTTERSON: Mr. Hyde is Dr. Jekyll's assistant. INSPECTOR NEWCOMEN: Does he live in the house? OLIVER UTTERSON: No, Inspector. But sometimes he stays overnight in the spare room. INSPECTOR NEWCOMEN: Is Dr. Jekyll at home? OLIVER UTTERSON: No, Inspector. I believe he's out attending a committee meeting of some nature. INSPECTOR NEWCOMEN: Would that be half of Mr. Hyde's stick? OLIVER UTTERSON: No, it is, uh, Dr. Jekyll's. I gave it to him myself. INSPECTOR NEWCOMEN: Filched by Mr. Hyde, no doubt. MR. EDWARD HYDE: (SINGING) Oh, fine religious decent folk in virtues flaunting golden scarlet. I sneer between two puffs of smoke. Give me the male and female harlot. [WRITHING IN PAIN] [DARK MUSIC PLAYING] [EXHALE] DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Oh, God help me. My sins are too great for me to bear. Please help me to walk again in my ways. PAPER BOY: Read all about it! Read all about it! [INAUDIBLE] Evening Gazette. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Gazette! Read all about it! Read all about it! [HORSE FOOTSTEPS] [INAUDIBLE] Evening Gazette! Read all about it. ANN COGGESHALL: Good morning, Poole. POOLE: Good morning, Mrs. Coggeshall. ANN COGGESHALL: I believe the doctor wanted to see me. POOLE: Yes, Madam He said we could go straight around to the laboratory. ANN COGGESHALL: Isn't that rather unusual? POOLE: Yes, Madam. This way, please. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Come in. PAPER BOY: Read all about it! Read all about it! POOLE: Mrs. Coggeshall, Sir. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Ann, how very kind of you to come. ANN COGGESHALL: You've heard the news, of course. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Yes, there are several things that we have to discuss. ANN COGGESHALL: First, Henry, there's a question I'd like to ask you. You're not hiding that man, are you? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: God no. I promise you that we shall never hear from him again. [CHUCKLE] ANN COGGESHALL: You said that once before on the evening we became engaged. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Yes, but this time, I am certain. ANN COGGESHALL: Oh, my dear one. [EXHALE] You look so ill and worried. Are you sure there is nothing I can do to help? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Ann, it was like we came out of a nightmare. But it was so real that it-- it burnt into my mind. But there is-- there is one thing that I think would help. ANN COGGESHALL: Yes? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: I think we should fix the date for our wedding. ANN COGGESHALL: Well, yes, Henry, yes. Of course, whenever you say. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, today is December 20. What would you say to the same day next month? ANN COGGESHALL: The motion is proposed, seconded, and carried. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: In the meantime, I will concentrate on regaining my strength and working as hard as I can for the Coggeshall Trust. ANN COGGESHALL: First, perhaps you should go away, take things easy. Why not, over Christmas? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Where would you suggest? ANN COGGESHALL: We could, uh, go to the lakes or to the sea. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: We? [CHUCKLE] ANN COGGESHALL: Oh, Henry, we're both mature people. We love one another. Why should we care what other people might say? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: As Dr. and Mrs. Jekyll? ANN COGGESHALL: Why not, if we have to? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Ann, people in our position must observe the proprieties, must observe the proprieties. ANN COGGESHALL: Proprieties? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: I realize why you're doing this. You're doing it for my well-being, for my sake. But I cannot allow you to sacrifice yourself for me in this manner. ANN COGGESHALL: My good name? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Precisely. ANN COGGESHALL: Yes. Henry, of course you are right, silly of me. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Thank you, Ann. ANN COGGESHALL: Goodbye. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Take, therefore, no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. Is something the matter, Janet? JANET: Yes, Sir. I think-- [SOBBING] DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, what is it? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, what is it? Out with it, girl. JANET: You know who it was. Mr. Poole and Cook told ya. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, what is it that you want me to do? JANET: I want you to make sure, Sir. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: I see. JANET: I wouldn't put myself in nobody else's hands, Sir. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, that's very kind of you, Janet, but there are certain ethics in my profession that have to be observed. JANET: Sir? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, it's not considered correct practice for a doctor to examine someone in his employ. JANET: Well, I've been working for you for three years, Sir. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, yes. I understand that, Janet. JANET: When I had whooping cough, you examined me, Sir. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: But it's hardly the same thing, Janet. JANET: I needed help-- DR. HENRY JEKYLL: I'm sorry, Janet. You will ask Mr. Poole to provide you with the name of another doctor, and he will attend to you. JANET: Yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir. It was your Mr. Hyde what done it. [DOOR SLAMMING] DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Dear God, let this be an end or let me die. [DARK MUSIC PLAYING] All my usual rounds then, Poole-- the East End hospital at noon. POOLE: And I believe you have a meeting with Mrs. Coggeshall and the trust at half past three at Mr. Lanyon's. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: That's correct, but I'm hardly likely to forget that, now am I? POOLE: If I may say so, Sir, the staff have hardly had the opportunity of wishing you all happiness, what with one thing and the other. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: I'm so sorry, Poole. That's very remiss of me. Of course, you and the staff are all invited to the wedding. Mrs. Coggeshall insisted on it. POOLE: That is most gratifying, Sir. Oh, and I have arranged for Mrs. Coggeshall to have her personal effects moved in here the day before, Sir. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Thank you very much, Poole. You think of everything. Harris. [TAPPING ON WINDOW] [TAPPING ON WINDOW] Thank you, Harris. I'll walk from here. HARRIS: Move on. [EXHALE] OLIVER UTTERSON: It's not like Henry to be late. ANN COGGESHALL: There's always so much for him to do at the hospital, and you know how conscientious he is. HASTIE LANYON: Well, I vote we start without him? OLIVER UTTERSON: Certainly. ANN COGGESHALL: Fine. Well, the first item on the agenda is my visit to the home secretary last week. [WHISTLE BLOWING] POLICEMAN: Johnny, it's him all right. It's Hyde. He lives up here. Edward Hyde, come down. POLICEMAN: Watch it! POLICEMAN: Watch out! Watch out Edward Hyde! POLICEMAN: Stop! POLICEMAN: Wait. Wait. [WHISTLE BLOWING] POLICEMAN: The building is surrounded. You cannot escape. [MAN SINGING] [DOG BARKING] [WHISTLE BLOWING] POLICEMAN: There he is. POLICEMAN: He's mad. It's deep that stuff. Hyde! Hyde. [WHISTLE BLOWING] [PANTING] POLICEMAN: Go around the other side. POLICEMAN: Right. [BREATHING HEAVILY] ANN COGGESHALL (VOICEOVER): If you truly love me, for God's sake, do as I ask. Poole has his orders. He will have a drawer from my laboratory ready for you to take Lanyon's house. Tell Lanyon to send all the servants to bed. And tell him that, shortly after midnight, a man will present himself in my name and that he should put the contents of the drawer into his hands. Then you must leave at once. And you will have earned my love and gratitude forever. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Have you got it? Have you got it? ANN COGGESHALL (VOICEOVER): Henry. HASTIE LANYON: See, you forget that I have not yet had the pleasure of your acquaintance. MR. EDWARD HYDE: No, forgive me, Mr. Lanyon. My impatience has shown heels to my politeness. Yes, I do come at the instance of your colleague, Dr. Jekyll. I was given, to understand, a drawer. HASTIE LANYON: Well, it's-- it's on the table beneath the napkin. You're far from well, Sir-- far from well. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Mr. Lanyon? HASTIE LANYON: Huh? MR. EDWARD HYDE: I'll give you a choice. HASTIE LANYON: Between what and what? MR. EDWARD HYDE: Well, either I can leave your house, in which case you will be left as before, neither richer nor wiser. HASTIE LANYON: And the alternative? MR. EDWARD HYDE: Is to allow me to inject this potion here and now, in which event you will witness a progeny to stagger the disbelief of Satan. [CHUCKLE] HASTIE LANYON: I'm a rational man, Sir, so you go ahead. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Ah, yes. That's the greed of curiosity, eh? HASTIE LANYON: If you like, yeah. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Very well, Hastie. HASTIE LANYON: How-- ha-- who are you? MR. EDWARD HYDE: You do not know me, Hastie. My name is Edward Hyde. HASTIE LANYON: Hyde? My God-- the police! [COUGHING] DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Hastie? PRIEST: Through Jesus Christ, our mediator and redeemer, Amen. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost be with us all evermore. Amen. [CHURCH BELL RINGING] OLIVER UTTERSON: I suppose we shall never know what happened, eh? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: No, I suppose not. OLIVER UTTERSON: Although, I could have sworn it was your signature in those notes to Mrs. Coggeshall and Poole. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Forgeries, no doubt. OLIVER UTTERSON: But why, Henry? Why? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, I have no idea, Oliver. I am not Inspector Newcomen. [CHURCH BELL RINGING] OLIVER UTTERSON: And concerning your new will, Henry, OLIVER UTTERSON: And concerning your new will, Henry, I have retained the previous request to your sons. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Quite so. OLIVER UTTERSON: And, of course, the residue of your estate to Ann. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Thank you. OLIVER UTTERSON: Would you like to come along with me now and sign it? I can offer you a glass of claret. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: You don't think it would be more appropriate to wait until after Ann and I are safely married, Oliver? OLIVER UTTERSON: Safely, Henry? Only a few more days? DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Nevertheless. OLIVER UTTERSON: Just as you say, of course. [DOOR CREAKING] [SNIFFLING] [DOOR CLOSING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Good morning, Poole. POOLE: Good morning, Sir. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, a man could not wish for a finer wedding day, eh? POOLE: No, indeed, Sir. Your gardenia, Sir. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Thank you, Poole. You all set for the great occasion? POOLE: Yes, Sir, except-- DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Why yes, Poole? POOLE: --it doesn't seem right on your wedding day, Sir. But I have to tell you that-- DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, come on, Poole, out with it. POOLE: It's the housemaid, Janet, Sir. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Oh, yes. Yes. Yes, I know. I, uh-- I, uh-- I told her that I suggested that you found her a doctor. POOLE: She's dead, Sir. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Oh, no. She can't be. POOLE: She threw herself out of her window while you were out last night. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Oh, no. No, she must have fallen. POOLE: The body was removed, Sir. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, why wasn't I told? POOLE: You were back very late, Sir. And what with today coming up, I didn't know what to do. But Inspector Newcomen said this morning-- DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, yes. Yes. Yes, of course. Of course. POOLE: She, uh-- she left a sort of note, Sir. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, may I see it? POOLE: Well, the inspector took it. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, what did it say? POOLE: She could scarcely read or write, but it was just a scribble on one of her curling papers, just one word. DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Well, what was it, Poole? POOLE: It looked like "Nobody," Sir. [SAD MUSIC PLAYING] DR. HENRY JEKYLL: Nobody? Nobody cares. January 20, well, I now see that at-- that any hour of the day or night the raging passions of Hyde will take control. And I am left with, well, nothing but the horror of my-- of my other self. [BELL DINGING] OLIVER UTTERSON: My dear, it's 2 o'clock in the morning. OLIVER UTTERSON: My dear, it's 2 o'clock in the morning. ANN COGGESHALL: What am I supposed to do about it? OLIVER UTTERSON: We're all very understanding, Mrs. Coggeshall. ANN COGGESHALL: What do you understand? No word, no note, no explanation, except that I am still Mrs. Coggeshall and not Mrs. Hyde. OLIVER UTTERSON: Not Mrs. Hyde? ANN COGGESHALL: Oh, I mean Mrs. Jekyll. Oh, god. I'm so tired, I don't know what I'm saying anymore. POOLE: Excuse me, Madam. Might I suggest that when the inspector has completed his investigation that you go up to the spare room? Gwen has prepared it already. There's no more you can do tonight. OLIVER UTTERSON: Yes. That seems to be good advice, Madam. [KNOCK ON DOOR] ANN COGGESHALL: Very well. [DOOR CLOSING] INSPECTOR NEWCOMEN: No sight of anyone but the servants in the house or the laboratory, Mrs. Coggeshall. My Constable at the front of the house tells me his carriage was waiting for him for over an hour. OLIVER UTTERSON: Yes, that's correct. When I arrived, as you know, I was to be best man, nobody could find him. INSPECTOR NEWCOMEN: Yet nobody's left the house. Well, I'm afraid there's nothing more we can do for the moment. ANN COGGESHALL: Thank you, Inspector. Good night. Oh and, Poole, could you, um, give the inspector and Mr. Utterson some refreshment before they go? POOLE: Yes, Madam. And for you, Madam? You haven't eaten anything this evening. Cook has gone to bed, but I could make you a chicken sandwich and bring it up to your room. ANN COGGESHALL: Thank you, Poole. I don't feel very hungry. POOLE: Very good, Madam. ANN COGGESHALL: Perhaps, though-- POOLE: Yes, Madam? ANN COGGESHALL: Perhaps a small glass of Madeira. [SAD MUSIC PLAYING] [DARK MUSIC PLAYING] MR. EDWARD HYDE: I can think of nothing more pleasant at the end of the day than to find oneself closeted with a beautiful woman. ANN COGGESHALL: Where is Doctor Jekyll? MR. EDWARD HYDE: And I my brother's keeper? Disappeared, I would think. ANN COGGESHALL: But why? MR. EDWARD HYDE: Well, one could only assume that he's changed his mind. ANN COGGESHALL: About what? MR. EDWARD HYDE: Marrying you. ANN COGGESHALL: I don't believe it! MR. EDWARD HYDE: I think you do. ANN COGGESHALL: Get away from that door. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Why don't you scream? The whole house would hear you. ANN COGGESHALL: You're wanted by the police. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Nobody else? Oh, my dear. ANN COGGESHALL: How dare you? MR. EDWARD HYDE: My dear Ann, what a sad waste of a wedding night. ANN COGGESHALL: How did you get here? The police are everywhere. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Well, my purpose in life is to release that wonderful, happy, shouting reality within us. ANN COGGESHALL: Satan, that's what you are. MR. EDWARD HYDE: Uh, you may call it evil, but I call it God's gift. ANN COGGESHALL: Who are you? I know those eyes. Who are you? MR. EDWARD HYDE: I'm half man, Ann, half man I think you would enjoy-- the hedonist-- the man who takes pleasure in the flesh and gives no thought for the devil. ANN COGGESHALL: I never thought that pleasures of the flesh were work of the devil. MR. EDWARD HYDE: No, I know that. But poor Henry Jekyll did not. So, again, what a sad waste of a wedding night. ANN COGGESHALL: You will get caught. You realize that. MR. EDWARD HYDE: We shall see. Mind you, I never intended to kill that stupid old man. It's just that sometimes giving way to one's temper can bring great satisfaction. ANN COGGESHALL: The moment I set eyes on you, I knew that words weren't necessary. MR. EDWARD HYDE: The way you looked at me. MR. EDWARD HYDE: The way you looked at me. ANN COGGESHALL: The second time I came to see you-- MR. EDWARD HYDE: Pretending to be worried about poor Henry. ANN COGGESHALL: Hm. MR. EDWARD HYDE: I knew. ANN COGGESHALL: The small glass of Madeira. MR. EDWARD HYDE: May I? We shall drink a loving cup to the two of us and absent friend. [KNOCK ON DOOR] POOLE: Mr. Poole, Madam. Is everything all right? ANN COGGESHALL: Yes, Poole. Thank you. POOLE: I thought I heard voices. ANN COGGESHALL: Voices? No, you must be mistaken. POOLE: Very good, Madam. Good night. ANN COGGESHALL: Good night, Poole. (QUIETLY) Yes. Yes. Oh, yes. Edward, it's 6 o'clock. It's time you left me. [EXHALE] [SCREAMING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [SCREAMING] POOLE: Mrs. Coggeshall, what? Mrs. Coggeshall? Mrs. Coggeshall, it's all right. I'm here. Mrs. Coggeshall, what is it? Run for the Inspector quickly. MAN: What's going on? POOLE: I don't know. Come upstairs, Mrs. Coggeshall. ANN COGGESHALL: [SCREAMING] POOLE: Take her up to the room, and fetch her clothes from the spare room. ANN COGGESHALL: [SCREAMING] POOLE: Go and fetch the copper from the back. MAN: Yes, Mr. Poole. [DARK MUSIC PLAYING] INSPECTOR NEWCOMEN: Mrs. Coggeshall, if you know who the man was, name him. Was this man Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde? ANN COGGESHALL: It was both of them. [CRASH] OLIVER UTTERSON: Henry, it's me, Oliver. Please open the door. [CRASH] [STORMING OUTSIDE] POOLE: Sir? OLIVER UTTERSON: Now listen to me, please. Your master is either seized with one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer, or it is not your master. In either case, I'm now resolved to bread down the door to his laboratory. And the inspector here agrees with me. Now come, Poole. We shall need lamps. Hurry, man. Hurry. [STORM CONTINUES] Quickly. Quickly. [STORM CONTINUES] INSPECTOR NEWCOMEN: Is it locked? OLIVER UTTERSON: Yes. [BANGING ON DOOR] INSPECTOR NEWCOMEN: Henry, I demand to see you! [INAUDIBLE] Oliver, for God's sake. [INAUDIBLE] POOLE: That was not the doctor's voice.
