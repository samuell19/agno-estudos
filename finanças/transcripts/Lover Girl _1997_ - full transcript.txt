(bus revving) (people murmuring) (baby crying) (soft pop music) - I've been on the road for two days now. It's no big deal, I'm used to being on my own. Ever since I was a kid, my mom would go on what she called a "Summer of Getaways." 'Cept she'd go on them about once a month. She'd usually go with one of her boyfriends, and then she'd usually bring back something like a beach bag or a stuffed animal. Last time my mom went on a summer getaway, she forgot to come back. I waited an entire month and I left to find something better. (upbeat rock music) (door knocking) - Hi, who is it? - It's your sister. (door knocking) - God, what are you doing here? - Mom split, she went on vacation last month and she never came back. - So what are you doing here? - I'm moving in. - No, um... You're kidding. I mean, I haven't seen you since you were like five years old. You know, you could have called me or something. - I tried, your phone was disconnected. - Right, well, you can't live here. - Why not? - It's not you, don't take it personally. It's really me, you know. I'm basically your total loser and I'm not a very good role model. - Well, that's okay, I don't care. I can practically take care of myself. - Okay, good. Well, you won't need me. How old are you now? - 16. - I left home when I was 15. I think you'll do better than I did. You know, just go out there and give it your best shot. Hit a home run. Here, you can have a punch. It's all I got. (upbeat pop music) - I don't know why I felt my sister would take me. I mean, she never even let me in her room when we were kids. It didn't matter. I still wanted to be just like her. She always had the best records, the best clothes, the best hair. When she left home she was going to open up a beauty salon and be a hairdresser to the stars. She said when I was old enough I could work there with them. I guess that didn't work out or else she just changed her mind. (door knocking) - Darlene, I know you're in there. I thought I told you to clean this crap up out here. Christ, a pigsty. - What are you doing to that door? - What does it look like I'm doing? I'm kicking beer cans out the door. - Well I don't think you should do that. - Oh, really, what are you, go tell your mama? - No, but I could tell my sister, she lives in there. - Yeah, I wish you would wake her ass up. I've got a couple of things to tell her myself. What's the matter, your bag too heavy? - She won't let me in. - What do you mean she won't let you in? - I don't know, but I was supposed to move in with her and she didn't want me. And I now I had to sleep outside because my mom ran away from me. - Well, hon, sounds like you're not too popular. Sure wish I could help you but I gotta get to work. - Hey, wait up. hey, wait. (upbeat rock music) - I thought you said you were going to work. - I am. - Then how come you're getting Shiatsu? - I'm not, you know it's none of your business what I do. But for your information, this is where I work. - Really? Well, can I come in for a sec? I gotta use the bathroom. - Why don't you use the one at the gas station? - It's out of order. Please, come on. I've been holding it all night. - All right, you can use the bathroom. * But don't bother anybody and keep your eyes to yourself. Hey, Ed, what's happening? Good morning, ladies. - What? Uh-uh, no way, yu can't do that. - Yeah, I can, ya's a word. - It ain't a word. Uh, I challenge you. - Go ahead, challenge. I know I'm right, go. - You seen my appointment? - Ya ain't no word. - Hey, what, what's happening you guys? Is, have you seen Mr. Smith, my 10:00 appointment? - You know, she puts a Y on the end of smile then she makes "Ya." Get the fuck out of here. Neither one of them's a word. - Both of them's a word, okay? I'm going to mark it down. - No, you don't mark that down. Get the hell out of here. 'Cause this ain't a word, I said shu-- - Hey, hey, I'm trying to conduct some business here. Now if you assholes can't shut up, I'm going to take that game and your Walkman and throw it out the freakin' window. Now I just want to know where the fuck Mr. Smith is. What room is Mr. Smith in? - Room four. - Mr. Smith's in room four? - Yeah, he's waiting on you in room four but you didn't have to mess up our game about it. - Well, I'm sorry, my hand slipped, hun. Come on, kid, the bathroom's this way. - Why'd she do that? I just go by the way people talk and people say "Ya." Everybody says it everyday and everyone will believe me. - It ain't a word. - Of course it's a word. - All I know is the rules on the back of the box say unless it's in the fucking dictionary it ain't a word. - Then the fucking rules are wrong, okay? - So you have a big summer planned, huh? - Yeah. - All right, how's that pool coming, is it finished yet? - You should see it, Angel, it's shaped like a comma. - Wow. - That sounds nice. - Yeah. - When can I come over for a dip? - Well, as soon as we get the slide up. - You are getting a slide. - Yeah, oh, yeah. I mean, the kids can't wait. It's all they ever talk about. - Well, sure of course, because the kids love to climb up on the slides and jump right off and you know what? That's the only reason 'cause they want to jump off of 'em. They don't want to slide. - You think so? - Uh-huh, I know so. And you better be prepared to spend the summer in the emergency room driving yourself back and forth. - Well, why is that? - Those kids are going to end up getting hurt. And you know what? I think you should think about the personal benefits of a pool. - Yeah? - Yeah. And what you're going to get out of it. Forget about the kids, you know, because really, you are extremely high strung, Mr. Smith. - Ah, ooh. - Yeah. - Ooh. - I think you should enjoy that pool yourself. - Yes, I will. Oh, that was good. Oh, yeah, ah. - Hey, whose kid is this anyway? - She came in with Angel. - Hm, who are you, kid? - Ferrari. Angel told me I could use the bathroom. - Angel let you in here? What the hell grade are you in? - I'm going to be a senior. - You're not looking for work, are you? - Of course she's not looking for work. She's looking for food. Look how skinny she is. I would kill for a body like that. - You already got a body like that. Your chest is as flat as hers. - Here, um, here, you want to sit? Have, have a seat. I'm Bambi. - Hi. - And that's, uh, Teddy and that's Coco. Will you go get her something to eat? Annie? - So, I-I thought you said her name was Teddy. Right, yo, no, Teddy's her fake name. And I'm Sally and that's Letitia, those are our real names. - Then who's Angel? - And Angel's Marcie. - They only got chips, you like chips? - Yeah. - Did you hear that, did you hear that? She said it. Did you say ya? You said ya, right? She said ya, she said ya. I win, I win, she said ya, ooh-ooh. - I'm so sorry about all the noise, Mr. Smith. But you know, sometimes the girls just act like orangutans. They, they don't know any better, but, you know. - That's okay. - Had a great time. So good to see you. Enjoy that pool, will you? - Hey, hey, I'm going to have you over there. It's a promise. - I'm taking up on it. I thought I told you guys to keep it down out here. - See, I told you to shut up. - What are you still doing here? - Nothing. I was just hanging out and I thought maybe-- - All right, that's enough. Get up off the couch. Let's go, I'm taking you out of here once and for all. You're going, I've had enough of this. Come on, move it. (door knocking) - Hey, open up. - What do you want? - Is this your sister? - Why do you want to know? - Just answer the question, is this your sister? - No. - Don't like, Darlene. You know I'm your sister. - I didn't come here to be a fuckin' family counselor. I just came to bring the kid back to you. - Do I look like I want a kid? - Honey, I don't know what you look like. All's I know is she's your responsibility and not mine. - I said I'm not taking her. - You're just going to leave her out here by herself? - How many times you want me to say it, I'm not taking her. - Well, somebody's got to take me. - I can't believe I'm doing this. Come on, come on. Okay, girlie, you got one night and only one night. And then I'm putting you on the next bus back home to mama. - I told you, she's not going to be there. - Oh, please. No mom's going to abandon their kid forever. You know, she probably, she just needed to get her ya-ya's out. Here, why, why don't you watch some cable and I need to get back downstairs. Go on, sit down, sit down. - Where should I put this? - Oh, shit. Here, give it to me. I'll put it in my bedroom, you can just sleep on my floor. - What about the couch? - No, honey, that's taken. (upbeat rock music) - Hey, chilling with the TV. You get high? - Sometimes, so I didn't know you lived up here. - I live on this couch. We all of us, the four of us. We live up here. It's been about two months now. We split rent, food. - That must be cool. - Yes and no. It's good for saving money, but I'm not making a career out of it. It's Marcie's castle really. Set this whole thing up. Got us organized, pooled in our money. I mean, she's totally getting my shit together. Next semester I'm going to Santa Monica U. I'm going to be a communications major. - So you're moving out? - Uh-huh. - When's that? - As soon as school starts. - When? - As soon as school starts. - I'm telling you. You don't have anything to worry about, Sally. Go to my guy. He'll hook you up. I mean, the nipples'll be straight. They'll hang right. Won't be no scars. I think you should do it. - I don't know. I mean, what about what happened to Chandie, huh? - What happened to Chandie? - She got this boob job down in Florida when she was dancing down there. It didn't heal right. It was like oozing and shit for like two weeks. And one day she's washing her face, right? All of a sudden a silicone thing pops right out in the middle of the sink. - What, no, I'm serious. - That bull shit didn't happen. - No, I-I swear to God, it happened, I saw it. I saw the baggie and everything. She keeps it on top of her TV. - She went to some dickwad, okay? I told you, you go to my guy and that kind of shit won't happen. - Ladies, don't you need to be somewhere? - Later. - Thanks for dinner, Marcie, I had no idea you could cook. - It's news to me. - Do you think I should get my boobs any bigger? - That's a great idea. You have no food, no place to live. You should definitely get breast implants. - My mom got 'em. - She did? - She said she liked the way her boobs looked after she had me. So she wanted them to stay like that. - Well that's the difference between her and me. Because when I was in that state, I couldn't wait to get rid of mine. - You had a kid? - A long time ago, but I gave her up for adoption. - How come? - Just wasn't the right time for me. A lot of stuff was going on. But she's in a good home and I still do things for her, you know. I send her a, a birthday card every year. - How old is she? - She's 12. - Hello, mom, are you there? If you're there, will you pick up? It's me, hello, Mom? (upbeat funk music) - Come on, get up. Up, up, up, move it, lazy ass. - Hi. - Hey. - Will you wash my dick too? - Don't start with me, girl. - Do you want a bagel? Is that all right to you? Don't do that. Washing in the sink is so gross. - We're almost done. - Yeah, well, it doesn't do much good anyways. You need to boil them. - Oh. - Baby, I'll see you. Well, good luck at home, all right? - Don't talk to no weirdos. - Bye. - Hey, you two, you gotta be in by 11. Okay, you got 45 minutes to pack up and clean up. - Can I just stay one more night? - I said one night and I meant it. - Oh, lighten up. She can stay another night, can't she? - She stays any longer she's going to be paying rent. - How much is rent? - More than you got. - Well, what if I made the money. What if I did what you did? - Well, that's pretty hilarious. You don't even know what we do. You don't know the half of it. - I do, too, I saw you talking to that guy about his pool. - Well, that was an easy one. It's usually a little bit harder than that. It's hard work, it's a lot harder than math homework. And, frankly, I don't think you're cut out for it. - Hey, where the hell is everyone? - Sally and Letitia aren't here? They're scheduled at 11. - Well, it's 11:20 and they ain't here. And where the fuck is Annie? - Yeast infection. - Oh, great, that's great. Then you're working today. - Oh, no, no, Jean, I can't. I just came in to pick up my chips and I got a million things to do today. - Yeah, well one of them is working, okay? You're the manager, Marcie. You gotta pick up the slack. - You're the manager? I thought you were the owner. - I'm the owner, who are you? - I'm Jake. - What is she doing here? She can't be in here. She's too young. How old are you? - I'm 16. - I thought so. You know, I got a daughter about your age. And I would kill her if she came in here. So, you're working, right? - No, Jean, you don't understand. I got to get this kid on a bus and she's leaving like in a half an hour. - I don't care. I gotta have three girls and right now I got no girls. Zip, I need someone. - Hey, Jean, I can work here. - What? - Yeah, maybe I could fill in. - Fill in. You listen to this kid? Oh, my God. Are you listening to this freakin' kid? Honey, if you wanted to work here, you should have given me a fake I.D. But I tell you what. Even that wouldn't have worked. We cannot have a minor in here. We will be shut down in a heartbeat. Oh, Mr. Smith. Oh, it's wonderful to see you. - Oh, it's good to see you. - Hmm, you smell so good. Angel's just getting ready. Okay, this kid can watch TV until you are done. But that's it. I mean, I can't take this aggravation. Not today. The plumbing is backed up at the package store. I gotta have my legs waxed, I'm going of my-- - All right, all right, all right. - Thank you, hey. Earn your keep. Put that thing in the back. - When I was living at home I decided to make my mom a gourmet breakfast. I cooked the eggs in a special sauce. I even decorated the plate with Gumi worms. I brought it up to her room but she and her boyfriend were still asleep. By the time they woke up it was dark out and all the food is cold and ruined. I have a feeling that wouldn't happen at Marcie's. Everyone gets up at the same time and Marcie yells at 'em. Everyone hangs out together and no one would eat breakfast at dinner time. (upbeat pop music) - Hi, uh, I was, uh, I was just wondering if you could help me out. - Hi. - Hi, uh, uh, I-I was just wondering, uh... Is this place for massages? I mean, really? You know, I heard a lot of, you know, a lot of different stuff. Do you know what I mean? Maybe I should back up a second. I-I'm, I'm Wright Herman. I'm, yeah, I'm, uh, anyway, uh, I work down the street at my, uh, dad's garage. It's, I-I was just wondering if-- - Do you want a session with one of the girls? - Yeah, yes, I mean-- - Well, they're all busy right now. - Oh, uh, oh, okay. Uh, let's see. I got about, uh, 45 minutes left on my lunch break. Uh, how about I, you know, just hang out and wait? - It'll probably be a long wait. - Okay, uh, um, hey, uh, you don't work here, do you? - Sometimes. - Aren't you a little bit young? I mean, shouldn't, shouldn't you be in school or something? - I'm on vacation. - Oh, well, uh, how, how much do you charge? - I don't know, $400. - Uh, $400. Man, that's, uh, that's a lot. Uh, I'm, I'm sorry. - Then how about 200? - Let's see, I got, uh, I got one, 183. - That's good. - Um, wait a second. I, uh, you know what? I'm sorry, I-I just, uh, changed my mind. - Geez, take a chill pill. Why don't you just relax? I mean, I could just give you a back rub or something. - Really? - Really. - Wow, uh, okay. Um, 'cause actually my, my back is killing me. - Well maybe I could fix it. - Hey, you want to know something funny? I don't even know your name. - It's Candy. - Mr. Herman, good to see you. (upbeat pop music) - You look like a guy who'd like pork rinds. This is (murmurs) too. - I forgot where the heck I was. These are people you work with? - Yeah, come here. - No, wait, Candy, I, my dad's going to kill me. I got to get back to the garage, no. - I'll even (murmurs). - Jake, what the fuck? - Guess what I just did? - You didn't. - I did. - You did. - Uh-huh, can I stay now? - Does Jean know about this? - Jesus. - Well, she wants to stay. She won't take no for an answer. You know what? I'm starting to think, maybe we should give her a chance. - I can't believe this is coming out of your mouth. I mean, at breakfast you wanted to get rid of her. - Well, honey. She made more in a half an hour than you've made all day. - All right about that. - I don't know. I don't think we have anything to lose. Let's give it a try. - Except our jobs if Jean find out. - Oh, honey, she won't, I know her schedule. I know when she comes in. And what, she walks in and here, I'll just tell her that was the day, came in to get some help with her homework. - It's summertime, Marcie. - Well, okay, it's summer school then. I mean, use your imagination. If she's not tipping the house, then everything is complete and total profit. We'll throw her a little spending cash and we make the bank. - I say it's got nothing to do with the bank. You just don't want her to go. - Fuck that, I want to make some money. Not 10, 20, 50, I'm talking $200 a week per person. - You believe her? - Uh-huh. - $200 a person. - A week. - A week, that must be good. - I can't wear that, I look like a dork. - I think it's cute. - Ooh, no way. - Yes, way. It doesn't fit me anymore. I want you to try it on. Come on, up on your feet, lady. You know, I was working when I was your age. - You were? - Yeah, but I didn't have me to look out after me. You're going to have it a lot better. You know, people think that when you're a pro in this business and you get raped every day, that's such a load of crap. It's, I mean, unless you have some big, fat man driving some big, fat car telling you what to do, you can pretty much run the show for yourself. - You can? - Yeah, in this business you have to use your head. I mean, if you have imagination and you use it, that's when you get good. All the girls do it. Even I do it. You think I sit around and have sex all day long? Yuck, not in a million years, it'd drive me out of my mind. - You don't have to have sex? - Hey, look. If you can get a guy to beat off, you can make your money by just dancing around the room. - Gosh. - I think you look excellent. (upbeat pop music) - In my whole life, no one's ever treated me like Marcie does. It's weird how some people can seem kind of hard. But then that's sweeter than anything or anyone. Marcie's kind of like that. She's kind of like a human jaw breaker. - Hey, Jake. Get over here. Jake. Open up. I'm serious. Shit. What's going in there? I didn't tell you to move in under my nose. - Uh, excuse me. It's not like you wanted me or anything. - That's not the issue. - So you want me? - That's not the issue. - Here. Since you need money so bad. It's worth more in Michigan. - Smart aleck. - What are you doing? - I like to separate the colors. There's some I don't like. - What difference does it make? They all taste the same anyways. - That's so not true. - Well, it is for M&M's. They all taste the same. - M&M's aren't good candy. In good candy every color is a different flavor. Purples are always the best. They're usually grape. Red's always the worst. It's usually cherry. I hate cherry. Sometimes they make a red that's strawberry, that's rare. Smarties make a red that's strawberry. But they also make a red that's cherry. You have to know the difference. - I never knew it was so complex. - Very complex. - Well either way you're going to end up with a mouth full of cavities if you keep eating that candy after you brush your teeth. - I already have a trillion. I have a cavity in every tooth, do you want some? - Okay, I don't think I like those Smarties. - That's cool. I have other kinds too. I have Shark Attacks and Flat Tires and Dirt Wheels and Crybabies. - Give me one of those Crybabies. - What color? - I don't know, what do you recommend? - Red. - But you told me it was the worst. - It's the best in Crybabies, it's watermelon. See that? Tastes just like a watermelon, doesn't it? - Yeah, it does. I want to try a little eye shadow. Oh, yeah, that's pretty. Great, and put on a little lipstick. That's a real pretty color for you. It's great on your skin tone. Oops. - Thanks, Marcie. I mean, thanks for everything. - It's okay, Chinka. Listen, I don't want you to worry about anything today. I'll be right there if anything happens. Not that it will. We'll find you somebody really great. You know, good looking guy. Young. We'll give you the best we get. (man humming) - Uh, oh. I like Mantebanni, huh? Play Mantebanni. - Who? - Jesus Christ, what's wrong with you, huh? Hey, do me a favor. Just sit over there til I finish my cigar. Much better. Yeah, that's good. - Want to try some of mine? It's an L-bubble. - Yeah, I'll try some. Bring it over. - What do you want me to do? - Forget it. Y ou like cigars, huh, baby doll? Huh? No, I like girls. They're like candy. Say you like candy. - I like candy. - What's wrong with you? Don't you like candy? Don't you like candy, baby? Come here. - I like it. But if you don't stop I'm going to-- - Ah. - I'm going to scream. - You're not going to scream, baby. - I'm going to scream. - You're not, come on. You're not going to scream, you're not going to scream. (Jake screaming) - Hey, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet. Sh, come on, baby, quiet. Oh, no, ooh. - What the fuck is that? - Old man. - Fat fuck. Get your mother fuckin' ass-- - All I asked her is she liked candy. - I'll kick your ass, son of a bitch. - I can't believe you touched that shit. And thanks a hell of a lot, Annie. - All I asked her (murmurs) if you liked candy. That's all I asked her. - Are you all right, sweetie? Did he hurt you? - Not really. - Well I know we hurt him. 'Cause he hit his shin up against that coffee table. That hurts. 'Cause I had hurt mine almost a thousand times. - What happened? - I could tell that guy was a sicko. The minute I laid my eyes on him. What he'd do, baby? Try to take a shit on you? - Well what'd he do? What happened in there, honey? What did he do? - Well he started rubbing me. - What do you mean? - Well he didn't really do anything. I just thought he was gross. What? - Yeah, he was all old and soggy. - You screamed like that because you thought he was gross. Hell, everybody come in here is gross. - Oh, shut your lip, Letitia. She's just learning. I'll take care of it, don't worry about it. - Yeah, well she might be young and cute now and all that but she can't pull that shit in here. - I'll handle it. Hey, I'm really sorry about the interruption. - Oh, no hurry, take your time. - I kind of have a favor to ask. Would you mind if, um, my friend here just kind of sat in during our session? She's just going to watch, you know. - I don't know, Angel, it seems a little weird. - No, it's okay. Just to hang out, you know. And, um, um, might even turn you on a little bit. - Well, what the hey. I guess you can stay. - Cool. Sit your butt down and pay attention. - Do you even know how to talk dirty? - Not really. - Oh, it's easy, really. You just go like this. Cunt, pussy, get chit, fuck, lick, cunt, shit, bitch. - Sally. Sally, shut up with your stupid shit, all right? This is serious. I mean, we just got this thing to working. Got myself a bank account last week. I'll never have to go back to the post office to buy a money order again. Never have to go back to checks cashed here. I'm telling you, my life is beautiful. I made it in unless this kid here fucks it up. You scream like that again and we're going to be back selling pussy, okay? On the fucking corner. - Cut out the pussy shit. - Fine. 'Cause I don't have time to argue anyway. I got to go to work. All I know is this house is too crowded already. And if this kid can't carry her own weight, , maybe this is not the best plan for moi. Sally, come on. - Jake, are you all right? What's going on inside that head of yours? - Are you going to kick me out? - Paying attention to those stress cases? You're not going anywhere. And you know what? You don't have to go out with every guy they try to set you up with. If there's something you don't like about them, anything, the way they look, smell, you just come to me. - Pussy? - Yeah. - Would you l, would you let your own kid do this? - I don't have a kid. - Yeah, you said you did. You said you had a daughter. - I guess if that's what she wanted, I wouldn't stop her. (upbeat pop music) - Is everything all right, sir? - No, it's not all right. You've got a major problem here lady. I want to speak to somebody in charge. - Well maybe I can help you. - Yeah? Well, I want my money back. I mean, this girl is a joke. I don't know if she's got her period or what. But, she's a total stiff. - All right, all right. Take it easy, just calm down. I'll see what I can do. Uh, you used a credit card, right? - It was cash. - Cash, oh, cash, okay. - Thank you. - Would you like to see one of our other girls? - No. - They're very lovely. No, what, what about a double? - No, thank you. - No, okay. Come back. Oof. - So who was that guy that you were with, huh? - Who, the bear? He was nothing, just a client. - What did, what did you do with him? - Not much, he was all begging in my face. Coco had to give him his stupid money back. - How come, how come you're wearing so much make-up? You know it makes you look like a hooker. - No, duh. - Well I like you better without it. - Fine, now it's your turn to take something off. - Hey, Candy. Sorry, can't we just do what we did last week? - No, Wright. Come on, the girls are going to spy on us. They'll probably fire me or something. - Well good, I mean, you shouldn't be here anyway. - Neither should you. - Yeah, I-I don't get you. You know, I don't get why you're doing all this. You know, you're cute, you're smart. You're, you're really nice. I mean, you should be at home with your family or something. - I am home with my family, okay? Will you just stop talking, take off your clothes and lay down so we can do it? - Candy, you're so, you are so-- - So what? - So sexy. (upbeat pop music) (women whispering) - Oh, boy. Oh, wow, Candy, that was amazing. - Wright, we didn't do anything. - Yes we did, we made love. - No, we didn't. You climbed on top of me, rolled around for a little while and then nothing ever happened. - Well it did for me, I think I'm in love with you. - No, you're not, Wright, you can't be. - Hey, I want to take you away from here. You know? Like on a date. - Like a date-date, I can't. - Yeah, why not? Come on, it'll be fun. - I'm not supposed to. - Okay, let's play a game then. Yes means no and no means yes. - What? - Just do it, okay? Yes means no and no means yes. You ready? Will you go on a, on a date with me? - Yes. - You will, terrific. No, you said yes, you can't back out. - I can't Wright. Just sign up for another second. - That's stupid. I'm not going to pay every time I want to see you. You know? You're too good for that. We're going out, okay? I'll see you on Friday. You and me are going to go out like two normal people. - Okay, who had the fish tacos? - That's mine. - Well, welcome to the cathouse, kid. Your mother would be proud. Anybody ready for dessert now? - What do you mean? You just got dinner. - Not yet. - I know, but who's ready for dessert? I know I am, who else is ready? - That's your problem. - I'll have dessert. - I knew you would. - What's this? - Open it. - Oh, wow. thanks, Marcie. - Oh, it's cute. - Oh, it's candy. (upbeat pop music) - Back home I never had to do housework 'cause mom was never around. I'd let the dishes pile up and I did the same thing with the laundry. The other time I ever did a wash was when I had to start wearing shorts for underwear. I never really understood when the kids at school complained about chores. But now I'm starting to get it. I mean, the girls at Marcie's are cool and all but sometimes I just don't feel like letting smelly guys touch my boobs. It's not that great. As far as chores go, this is way worse than taking out the garbage. - Hey, Jake. You're looking like a real piece of trash. You know that? That's what happens when you live with sluts, you start looking like them. You probably work with them too. What? I can't hear you. - I do, I work there. - Really, how? What do you do? Scrub toilets? Pick up the trash. Answer the phones, what? - What do you think I do? I suck guys' dicks, all right? - Fucking had it with that whore. - Darlene, wait. Wait, look, I want to show you something. - I had no idea they brought in this kind of money. - Yeah, I usually make 200, sometimes three. You can make six on a double. - I know. I could be living in a condo or something, you know? What exactly do you have to do? - Not much, mostly everything but. - You could get AIDS from that. - No-uh, we practice safe sex. Guys even wash with a special soap. - And it doesn't gross you out? - It's no biggie. Put on a rubber on it and it's practically like anything. A Swirlie Pop, a Smartie Pop. - You made all of this today. - I told you, this morning. - Wow. - I worked hard all my life. I believe in hard work. Now they ain't no question that my girls are honest, because I've been on the other side of the fence. See, I've done what they do, so I know. And some places take 60, 70%. I take 45. You work hard, you get to play hard. Now, I look at you and I have to ask myself, why does this girl want to work hard? - For the money, why else? - Well, that ain't saying much. Everyone I know needs money. Why are you looking to make it here? - 'Cause all my life I've always wanted to be a slut. - Look, honey, if you're trying to be cute, you ain't. Now you better start giving me some straight answers if you want a job. - Sorry, all right. - You got a license? - Yes, but I don't have a car. - I'm talking about a certification. You can't work in the health spa business without a license. - Well how do I get one? - You take a test. - You want me to take a test? - No, I want you to take a walk. Why don't you try the Tokyo Health Spa. They don't speak English there. - What's that supposed to mean? - It means I think you're a cop. - You think I'm a cop. - Sure, you got no money. Got no license. Got a bad attitude. That spells cop. I mean, for all I know you could be sitting here with a wire in your panties. So, come on. Just do me a favor, please. Get the hell out of my place. - First of all. I was born broke, that's why I have a bad attitude. And second of all, I know half the girls in here and none of them have licenses. And the only thing that I've got in here is this. - You're hired. - Thank you. - You're good. You're good looking. You'll go anywhere. Go next door. Over to Van Nuys. My girls are the best around. - Well they must have had a good teacher. - What's up, man? It's insane. Hey, Jean, what are you doing here? - We have a new girl, what's she doing here? - Oh, she was just leaving. She just came down to talk to Teddy about something about something upstairs and she's going right back up. - What is she doing here? - I'm the new girl. - How about her Jean? Can she join us, too? - Angel? - Yeah. - Certainly. As a matter of fact, she can show Cherry the ropes. You can have our best girl and our new girl. - Excellent. - You don't mind, do you? - Cherry? - Just right this way, perfect. - You know you cannot go in there. Now you're going to get your skinny butt back upstairs. Don't make have to throw you. No go on out of here. And don't come back down here. I ain't playing with you. Go on upstairs. - Okay, just let me handle this okay? Just try to follow my lead. Just stay relaxed, all right. Um, I'll do the talking. - No problem. - Hi. - Hi. - Why don't you just stretch out right here. Want us to start with your front or your back? - Uh, how about the front. - Okay. - Hmm, that's cold. - So, um, what do you, what do you do for a job? - Well what do you think I do? I'm a cop. I'm just kidding. - No, what do you really do? - Guess. - Um, you, you're an accountant? - No. - Um, an insurance man? - No. - I know, you're a teacher. You look just like my teacher from eighth grade. Earth Science. - I'm a hairdresser. - You're kidding. - Yeah. - Oh, my God, that's so funny. That, no, that's really funny. 'Cause I've, I've wanted to be a hairdresser since I was a kid. - Really? - Yeah. - Well what happened. Uh, no offense. - No, no, it's no big deal. It just, uh, you know, it didn't happen. And one thing leads to another and, you know, next thing I know I'm living in an apartment, you know, up here-- - Uh, Cherry, uh, I have to talk to you for a minute. - Uh-huh, sure. - What are you thinking in there? What is this shit? - What did I do? I didn't do anything wrong. - You just cannot be telling this guy the kind of shit you're telling him. - Well I was just, I was making conversation. I was trying to act naturally. - No, no. I told you to let me handle this situation. You don't even know this guy. You're flirting with him. You're telling him where you live? - I was just having fun. You know, I mean, that's no big deal. - I'll tell you something. This is not fun. This is a fucking job, okay? There's nothing romantic, glamorous or fun about it. Do you want to have fun? Throw yourself a birthday party, okay. I'm here to do a job. You better your ass out in this lobby and let me deal with this shit, okay? - Ladies, I only got about 10 minutes left. What do you say we finish the massage with your clothes off? - I'll wait for you. (door knocking) It's open. I was just cooking up some of this, uh, dinner. - What the hell were you doing down there? - Working. - Who said you could work there? - My boss, is this done? - Darlene. Why don't you mind your own beeswax. I was there first. - Just relax, okay? - God. But Jean isn't even supposed to know. Did you tell her? - Look, you're still working there, all right? Besides, you're the one who sold me on the idea. - Yeah, but I didn't want you to work there. - Hmm, well I didn't want to work there either. But, guess what? I think I found my calling. - Your calling? - Yeah, I mean, for the first time in my life I was actually in the catbird seat. - Yeah, but what you don't get is I don't want you there. - I understand. I mean, you're pissed because I kicked you out and you have every right to be. I mean, I was a real jerk-off. It just freaked me out when you showed up and you were standing there all broke and everything. I just such an asshole, I'm sorry. - You're not an asshole. - You don't have to say that. I know I am. But what do you say we just put it all behind us and turn over a new leaf. You can stay for dinner if you'd like. - Is that Chateaubriand? - Uh-huh, just like Mom used to make. So, pull up a plate. I got a 'frigerator full of beer. - You can call me Candy if you'd like, it's my new name. - Well, it's nice to meet you, Candy, I'm Cherry. That's the best part. - Where have you been? - Darlene asked me to stay for dinner. - Oh, so everything's just hunky-dory. You just go over there and have fun like nothing ever happened? Well, did you? - Did I what? - Did you have fun? - I guess. - How much fun? - Go get your sweater. - This is fun, isn't it? - Maybe it's you, but I don't like chocolate. - It's melting all over the place. W-Why don't you eat it, you'll like it. - I already had dessert at Darlene's anyways. - Oh, you did, huh? - Yeah, and it was way better than this crap. - I don't suppose the food that Darlene cooks for you is way better than the dinners I make for you every night, huh? I suppose that the money that Darlene gives you is way better than the money I give you to buy clothes? Matter of fact, why don't you just go stay with her? 'Cause I'm sure her bed's a lot more comfortable than mine. - Geez, calm down. I was just talking about ice cream. Wait. - You can have 35, 45, up to 55 minutes. There is a $60 tip fee above the actual fee. Okay? And you can pay me in cash. You can pay me with a card. And meet with the lovely ladies. Mr. Smith, you're early. - Am I? My watch must be running fast. Oh, well that's okay. Angel'll be back in 25 minutes. Hi, Ed. In the meantime, come on over, have a seat. - Okay. - Or you can have me. Hold your horses. Now, he sees Angel. He don't want you. - Even if it's me and my little sister? We have this thing where we like to work together. - I, uh, I only know Angel. - I can fix that, I'm Cherry. - Darlene. - That's Candy. We're pleased to meet you. - The pleasure is all mine. - You won't be disappointed, Mr. Smith. Come on, Candy. Come on, I think room three is free. Come on, Mr. Smith. - Okay, okay. - Come on. Just make yourself comfortable, Mr. Smith. - Sounds good. - We shouldn't be doing this, Darlene. - Just calm down. Right? You think too much. - Well, he's supposed to take a shower first. - Looks pretty clean to me. I think we should just go for it. You look great, Mr. Smith. - Thanks, doll. - Um, you just relax, okay? Candy and I are going to slip into something a little more fun. Come on. This'll be good. - I can't believe they're still in there. - Yeah, I think it's really sick. Two sisters. - Uh-huh. - Thanks for stopping in. Bye. Where's Mr. Smith? He in the back? - He's here but he didn't wait for you. - Marce, maybe you should, um, sit down for a minute. - Mind telling me what's going on? He was supposed to be here at four. - He was here at four. - What's so funny? - He's in the back. With the Ferrari sisters. - The who? - Jake and Darlene, they're back there doing a double. - Ow, what's going on? - What assholes. (women screaming) - Holy, Jesus. What the fuck is going on here? - It was her fault, Jean. Ask this cunt. - Fuck you. I was just doing my job, bitch. - Hey, both of you. Watch your fucking language. Look at this place. Look at my lamp. Now simmer down right now, both of you. I don't care who started it. I want it to end now. Now, shake hands. - I'm not shaking her hand. - I said shake. And where the hell is Ed at? He went to get us some burgers. - Oh, naturally. Yeah. Naturally I get stuck with a security guard who doesn't do shit. I got a manager who beats up employees. I can't turn my back for one second and the roof comes caving in? Well don't just stand there scratching your asses. Get this place picked up. Let's go. Chop, chop. For Christ's sake. - Put your clothes on. Jean's out there. So when did you decide to steal my clientele? - I didn't steal him. I didn't want to be in here with him. I didn't want to be in here at all. - Well you asked for it, Jake. That's what this job's all about. You're the one who wanted it so bad. - You're the one who wanted me to want it. You're the one who made it seem so great. - Oh, oh, I was supposed to know that you didn't want to be a hooker? Okay, so I fucked up. I should have never let you in here. I should have stuck to my guns and made you go pee at the gas station and none of this ever would have happened. Well, it's over, okay? Guess today's your last day. I don't want you to work here anymore. I don't even want you to come in here anymore. From now on, I'm going to take care of you. Just want you to act like a regular kid, all right? - It's too late. - What do you mean? - I think I'm permanently ruined. - Candy, hey. - Wright, what are you doing here? - I got a surprise for you. Ta-dah, chocolates, I got 'em. - That's nice, Wright, thanks. - So it's, uh, Friday night. We're, uh, going out. - Oh, gosh. I didn't really think you were serious about that. - Serious, uh, I mean, I've been planning it all week. I've, I've got our, our whole itinerary worked out. Are you hungry? We'll go get a, a burger, uh, and a malted and, uh, then I'm going to take you to a car show. It's huge. It's gonna, you're going to love it. I-I promise. - I can't go, Wright, I'm sorry. - What do you mean you can't go? - I just am not going. I'm not, I don't feel like it. I'm not in-- - But, Candy, you promised. - I'm not in the mood for a car show. Besides that, we're not allowed to date the clients. It's against the rules. - Forget the rules. - Jesus, just, can you listen to me? I don't feel like going. Just leave me the fuck alone, please. - Hey, Candy, wait. Candy, come back, I'm sorry. (upbeat pop music) - I'm going to get myself a manicure and a pedicure later. - You should go to my Jamaican girlfriend. - No, no, no, no, no. I'm going to go to my Korean place, okay? So don't push me. - Oh, god, are you in a bad mood today or what? (door knocking) - Who is it? - Darlene, I need to talk to you. - You alone? - They're all at work. - What's the matter with you? - Why? - I don't know. You just look like something's the matter. Are you sick? - I'm tired. - Well, I want to talk to you. I didn't have a chance to tell you this yesterday but I thought we worked really well together and, I mean, you did great. And it gave me a great idea. I think we should join forces. - I'm quitting, Darlene, I don't want to do it anymore. - But you were doing so well. Come on. - No, I wasn't. - Sure you were. And think about all the money you were making. Shit. If I, if I put my money with your money, we could be rich. We could be millionaires. - Not interested. - You have to be. Look, I'm not the same that I was when you first got here. I'm different now. I mean, I-I think, like, you know, I could have a sister. - Well, I don't know if I can. - You know, you, you can. - Why did you eat my food, huh? I don't think you even like pork rinds. - I don't. - Then why you been eating it for the last hour? - I don't know, I'm bored. - Come on, have a cigarette. Have a cigarette. Leave my food alone. Don't make me hurt you, baby. - Ooh. - How you doing, gentlemen? Teddy's going to take care of you. - Hi, hi. - Enjoy. Here's your credit card. Thank you. - This way. This is my friend, Cherry. - Hi, Cherry, hello. - Hey, kid, how you doing? What are you, eating some candy? Come on. We got one or two things to straighten out here. - Hey, Jean, what's happening? - Don't "What's happening" me. I know what's been going on here. I think you girls have something to tell me. Am I right? - I don't think so. - That's funny. 'Cause Darlene had quite a bit to tell me. - What did she have to tell? - I knew something was fishy the minute you brought this kid in here. I had a funny feeling. But no, I looked the other way. I liked you, Marcie. I liked you a lot. I treated you like a daughter, you son of a bitch. - Jean, don't go crazy on me. - I will go crazy if I want to go crazy. You been pimping this girl behind my back in my place. I will go more than crazy. You're fired. Now you collect your shit and you get off the premises. And you three. You're just as despicable. You better cough up my cash or you can pack it in with her. - I'm not coughing up shit, I earned whatever I got. - Yeah, what the hell did we do? - If you took a percentage, and I know you did, then you owe the house and that's me. Remember? Now let's have it. Ante up. You ante up or you're out of work and join Marcie for all I care. - Then I'm out of work. I was going to quit anyways. - Come on, Sally. I don't have to take this shit. I'm going to kick yore ass. - Oh, okay. That's the way you want it. You can all go fuck yourselves. One big group fuck. Now get the hell out of my store. I said, get out, all of you. - Candy? - Whoa, dude. - Look, I don't want any trouble. I-I-I just want Candy. - Sorry, pal. I don't sell candy. Try the corner store. - Not candy, Candy. Look, I want the girl. Okay, I'm taking her out of this dump once and for all. - Ed, get rid of this loser. - Hey, oh, okay. Oh, okay. Have it your way. Fine, I'm going to call 911. That's right, lady. Let 'em deal with the fact that you've got a minor working here. Huh? She's a minor. - Wright, what are you doing? - Taking you out of here. I'm rescuing you, Candy. - Wright, you don't even know me. First of all my name isn't Candy. - What? - It's Jake. - It is? - I'm going to dial 911 myself and blow this place wide open. (people screaming) (upbeat rock music) - All right, I got the phone, it's over. - Where's Jake? - I don't know why I thought I needed those girls. It's pretty obvious I don't. You know what they remind me of? Screaming Sour Balls. At first they seem so good you can't stop eating them. But then you eat so many you get cuts in your mouth and bumps on your tongue and you wonder why you started in the first place. They all make my stomach hurt. I think the best thing for is just to be alone. - Hello girl, you want some candy? - No, thanks. - I've got some really good kinds. I've got Dirt Wheels, Wacky Taffies, Crybabies. - I don't like candy. - Since when? - Since today, will you please leave me alone? - Where you going in such a hurry? - Somewhere. - Oh, really? That's cool, me, too. Wanna lift? - What would I have to do for it? - Not much, just find me a good radio station. (upbeat pop music)
