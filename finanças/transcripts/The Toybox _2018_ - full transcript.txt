STEVE: Yeah, as far as I can tell. Good, 'cause this boat is leaving the dock in two minutes! Olivia, honey, please don't jump on the bed. This camper is old, I don't wanna break Grandpa's new toy. This isn't new. Well, it's new to Grandpa. Off. Steve, where's your brother? We gotta get on the road. Taking his sweet time. Honey, please don't start. You promised. JAY: Yeah, honey, you promised. Really, Jay? This is a real peace of shit, Dad. Uncle Jay, Uncle Jay! What's up, snugglebug? CARL: Hey Steve, come get your dog! How's my little girlfriend? How are you? (DOG BARKING) Bentley, come here! Bentley, come on. Sorry about that, Carl. He was about to shit on my lawn again. Sorry about that. Oh, no worries. Nice RV. Have a good day, Carl. Hey, hey, excuse me. I'm looking for my son. He's 13, brown hair. He was wearing jeans and a black T-shirt, riding his bike. He just didn't come home last night, did you see him? Uh, gosh no, I haven't. I'll keep an eye out. Okay, thank you. Uh-huh. Come on, Bentley, get in here. (BENTLEY WHINING) God, he does not like this RV. What did that woman want? Ah, she was just looking for her son. I guess he didn't come home last night. I hope she finds him. STEVE: Yeah, I know. CHARLES: Well, should I whip these horses and get this coach rollin'? I don't know, Pop, does it start? Jay, come on. CHARLES: This old mare has a few years left in her. Yeah, but does it start? It's a fair question. (STARTER WHINING) Oh. Just give her a chance, alright? (STARTER RUMBLING) (ENGINE RUMBLING) That's my girl!

Mom would have loved this for us. Yeah, yeah, she would have. (FOREBODING MUSIC) Mama, it's hot. I know, baby. Honey, can you please turn the air conditioner on? It's on, check the vent. Yeah, it's just blowing hot air. It's not cold up here either. I know you guys are too young to remember this, but back in my day we used to open the window to get fresh air. Well that's strange, it won't open. Ah, you gotta be kidding me. Hey Dad, I'm curious. Back in your day on your road trip with Moses and Jesus to the Grand Canyon, how'd you get fresh air if you couldn't get the windows open? Hey, check the ones back there. (DOG BARKING) This one won't budge. Can you try that one? This thing's like glued shut. I doubt it's been open in years. What happened there? What? I loosened it for ya. Thanks, Daddy.

No. She's okay. Hey, how about we go over there and we watch a little TV? I'm sorry, hon, the TV's broken. Be sure you keep your fingers inside, okay little bear? You know what? You wanna go see what Bentley is doing? I bet Bentley wants to play. Yeah? And then I'll finish your lunch. Alright honey, go see Bentley. (UNEASY MUSIC) Alright everybody, we're about 30 minutes away from our first stop. What's there? Cave paintings. Some going back to our prehistoric times. Amazing, can't wait. I thought it might be nice to see some of our history. I'm sorry if it's not cool enough for you, Jay. Sounds pretty cool to me. Me too. Yeah, Dad, I think we'd all like to see that. Hey Jay, can you give me a hand with something? Yeah, why not. Make sure you finish eating your carrots, okay honey? Okay. Hey Olivia, guess what? What? Inside the cave, they found some animal bones belonging to a Shasta ground sloth. What's that? It's like a big white fluffy bear that has a long neck and a tail, and it smiles all the time. (LAUGHING) I don't care, Jay. We can do without your little comments. What comments? Really? Look, I know you don't wanna be here, but can you at least pretend to enjoy yourself just a little bit? I am pretending. Then maybe you can do a better job for Dad. For Dad? Really? What the fuck did he ever do for us. Guys, please. Look Jay, we've all been through a lot this last year. I know you're hurting. I miss her too. But I can't help but think this is Dad's way of trying to bring the three of us back together. If you can't do it for Dad, do it for me. Uh, guys, sorry to interrupt, but your Dad's stopping. He's stopping? Mhmm. Dad, why are we stopping? There's a car up ahead that's pulled off on the side of the road. Looks like they might need some help. (UNEASY MUSIC) I'm gonna see if they need anything, alright? Who's they? There's no one around. Maybe this isn't such a good idea, Dad. Hey fellas, if it was us, I'd really appreciate it if somebody stopped to help, huh? Come on. Whatever, knock yourself out. (FOREBODING MUSIC) I don't know what the hell he thinks he's gonna do. Dad doesn't know shit about cars. Steve does. Since when? OLIVIA: Daddy changed the tire once. That's what I thought. There's no one around, Dad. Maybe somebody came by and picked 'em up already. Well, I still think we should have a look, Steve. Come on. Steve, Steve, come here. Come here. Jesus Christ! Sorry. Uh, what the hell are you doing? Take it easy, we just stopped to help. Hey, you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, I apologize. We just saw your truck on the side of the road and thought maybe we could lend a hand. Well then, thank you, I guess. My name's Charlie, this is my son, Steve. - Hi. - Hi. - Sorry. - Hi, I'm Mark. This is my sister, Sam. Nice to meet you. So what seems to be the problem? Oh, dude, you're looking at the wrong guy. Sam's the mechanic in the family. I just got the good looks. I think we blew a head gasket, but I'm not gonna know until I get it to a shop. Yeah, we tried calling a tow truck earlier, but we can't get a signal out here. You're honestly the first people we've seen in the last few hours. Yeah, I'll bet. Well, look, if you don't mind, I mean, grab what you need and lock it up and leave it here. We'll be happy to drop you off at the next town. You can find a service station or mechanic that can help you. As long as you don't mind making a little bit of a side trip. We're on our way to see some cave paintings as part of our family trip. Yeah. Are you sure your family doesn't mind? (UNEASY MUSIC) Oh shit! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Sam? Hey, what happened? (UNEASY MUSIC) You okay? I don't know. Something's not right. I'm getting a weird feeling. Well the next town can't be far. We'll stop off and get what we need and go, okay? Okay. Okay. Oh, hi. What's your name. OLIVIA: Olivia. Cool, I'm Mark. I like your doll. Shh, she's sleeping. Oh, oh, okay. It's nice to meet you, Olivia. You guys doing okay? Yeah, yeah, we're fine. Everybody hold on, this is our turn! Oh, sorry. There should be a map in the glove box. Okay. Mhmm. (UNEASY MUSIC) Is that it? Yeah. You sure this is the right turnoff? Well. We've been driving five hours and now you put on your glasses? (LAUGHING) Does that say 6M27, no, 6ML27? It does. Bingo. That's the one, baby. That's what we've been looking for. We're only 10 or 15 minutes away. Perfect. Everybody ready? JAY: Let's do it, Pop. OLIVIA: Ready! Here we go. (UNEASY MUSIC) You know, I just wanna say I really appreciate you guys giving us a lift. Well, you're welcome. Actually, I'm really looking forward to seeing these cave paintings. We are too. Hey Dad, you said 15 minutes 30 minutes ago. I know, I know, it should be right up ahead. Or way behind us by now. It says it's five miles from the highway, Dad. Yeah, but listen, I've only been driving 10 or 15 miles an hour with all these bumps and rocks. Yeah, for over 30 minutes. Do the math, we passed it. He's right, we need to turn around. Dad, why you speeding up? I don't know, I'm not doing it! Hold on! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) STEVE: Hit the brakes, Dad! I am, it's not stopping! Mom! CHARLES: I don't know what's wrong. STEVE: Dad, hit the brakes! I'm trying, dammit, I'm trying! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DOG BARKING) (THRUMMING MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (WHIMPERING) (GROANING) (COUGHING) (GASPING) (UNEASY MUSIC) You're not gonna get reception, we're too far out. I know. What are we supposed to do? There is a dead man and we're stuck in the middle of nowhere. Shit! Mommy. I'm sorry, baby. I tried turning the engine over, but something blew just before the crash. Mommy. Hold on. We're gonna be out here for days or weeks before anyone comes by. This place isn't exactly a tourist trap. Mommy? What? Honey, I am sorry. What's wrong? Bentley's gone. Great. I think Bentley just went out for a little walk. I'm sure he'll be back real soon. Promise? Oh, I promise. Yeah? Closest town is 45 miles out. Nobody can make that walk in this heat, Dad. (UNEASY MUSIC) What about the highway? Am I the only one thinking about the dead guy? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Don't touch me! I told him something was wrong. I told him. Don't touch me. You killed him! You did this. You and your goddamn camper. (UNEASY MUSIC) WHISPERING VOICE: Olivia. I'm gonna grab a water. Grab a couple. Okay. (STATIC CRACKLING) Up you go, little princess. Is that everything? STEVE: As far as I can tell. Good, 'cause this boat is leaving the dock in two minutes. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Olivia, honey, please don't jump on the bed. This camper's old. I don't wanna break Grandpa's new toy. Well, it's new to Grandpa. (STATIC CRACKLING) (JENNIFER SCREAMING) Mommy? Baby, what happened? You okay? Hey. Olivia, can you please go see what Grandpa is doing, honey? Okay. You okay? Look at me, what's wrong? Get us outta here, because I wanna go home. What happened? What happened? Are you joking? We crashed, we're stranded in the middle of nowhere. Not too mention a man just died in front of our daughter. Look at these. What are these? Your daughter just drew them. (UNEASY MUSIC) I'm telling you, there is something going on in there! Do you think I wanted our daughter to watch a man die? I wish to God she hadn't, but I can't change that. I'm not a mechanic, I don't know shit about engines. So baby, tell me, what the hell do you want me to do? Figure it out! It's your job to keep the family safe. You don't think I know that? I don't know. I know you don't have all the answers, but I trust that you will figure this out. Shit. JAY: Do you need anything? Yeah, I do. I need you to pop the hood. Come on, you coming? What do you think? I don't know, I can't tell. See if it'll start. (ENGINE COUGHING) Great. You think you can fix it? I don't know, I've looked at it for two seconds. Why don't you give me some room? Sorry, I'm just trying to help. So far your help got my brother killed. Hey, pump the gas and try again. You fucking piece of shit, come on. (ENGINE COUGHING) (ENGINE RUMBLING) Oh, there you go. (ENGINE BUZZING) What the? Screw this thing, man. Hey. Hey, look at this. What is this? There's something down here. (URINE SPLASHING) (FOREBODING MUSIC) (STARTER SWITCH CLICKING) (ENGINE RUMBLING) (SCREAMING) Shit! Dad, are you alright? Shit, they got it started. How'd you guys get the engine... (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Oh my God, I'll get some towels. Dad, come on. Watch your step, Dad, come on. (GROANING) Hold still. Oh, come on. I know, I know, I know. It hurts, oh God. I'm sorry. (GROANING) It's alright. Mommy, what happened to grandpa? Oh, hon. Here. It's okay. Come on, honey. Grandpa's okay, he just cut his arm. We gotta get Dad to a hospital before he bleeds to death. JAY: How do you suppose we do that? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) JENNIFER: You'll be okay. Come on. (ENGINE COUGHING) God damn it! God damn this fucking RV! Steve, stop it! You're scaring Olivia! (UNEASY MUSIC) (FIRE CRACKLING) We gotta get the engine started in the morning. It's fried. We got it started before. We can't keep it started. Well, we gotta get Dad to a hospital thanks to you. Stop saying that. It was Dad who decided to put his hand in the engine like an idiot. What'd you say? You heard me! Get off me! What the hell? I'm gonna go find some more wood. Jesus. Mommy, is Grandpa gonna be okay? Grandpa's gonna be just fine. I don't want you to worry. You need to get some sleep, okay honey? Okay. Alright, good night. Good night. I love you. I love you too. (DOOR SQUEAKING) (GROANING) (UNEASY MUSIC) Uh! (COUGHING) Oh my God. Charles, how you holding up. My arm feels like it's burning. Here, these will help. (COUGHING) I actually think I'll join you. You can stay inside the RV, it's gonna get pretty cold out here. Do you have a tent? Yeah, so Jay and I'll stay in the tent... I'll take the tent. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Okay. I'll stay out here too. I don't need a babysitter. Didn't say you did, but it's my tent. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) (UNEASY MUSIC) (RUSTLING) (URINE SPLASHING) (WHISPERING) Hello? (WHISPERING) Hello?

(DISTORTED SPEAKING) (SCREAMING) How you feeling? Considering half my forearm's gone and I've got a hangover, not so good. Well, I'm gonna grab the others. We can start working on the engine. Ah, I'm gonna come with you. No, no, Dad, just sit there for a little bit, okay? Just rest. I'll let you know if we need you. Alright. Okay. Where's Samantha? You figure anything out? From what I can see, it should work. Great. What do we do now? Well do you have any tools? Let me go look. Okay. Anything I can do? Do you know anything about engines? Not really. Well then, no. Hey Dad, did you happen to bring any tools? Look in the closet. Okay. We got the level or, uh, gigantic rusty scissors. What do you want to use first? How 'bout the wrench? Okay, I'll leave you to it. Go get it and come right back, okay? Okay, Mommy. Hi, Dad. Hey, monkey. You okay? Yeah. I'm gonna go talk to Jay. Okay. Have you ever been married? Me? No. Not really your thing? It just never really worked out. (UNEASY MUSIC) (DOOR CREAKING) Mommy! We should really be on a sandy beach right now. Honestly, I think I've had enough sand for a while. You make a good point. OLIVIA: Mommy! Ah well, I should go see what she wants. Okay. Hey, can one of you guys turn over the engine for me? Mommy, please can I use the jump rope? Yes, you can use the jump rope. But only where I can see you. OLIVIA: Okay. Thank you. Hey Pop, I gotta get in here. Alright. Alright, careful. CHARLES: Alright, I got it, thanks. (ENGINE COUGHING) I just don't understand. Jay, try it again! (ENGINE COUGHING) (UNEASY MUSIC) Mommy, watch me. That's good, baby. Mommy, you're not watching. I see you. That's good. (UNEASY MUSIC) Jay, quit screwing around. Try it again. (COUGHING) (ENGINE COUGHING) Come on, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go ahead, go, go, go. (ENGINE RUMBLING) Yes!

Honey, you're not making any sense. Everything in this camper's gonna die. Come on, let's get you in the back bedroom so you can get some rest. Baby, don't leave me. I don't wanna be alone with her. With who? The girl on the TV. The girl on the TV? Yes. Okay, I need you to do me a favor. I need you to lie down here for a couple of minutes and rest while I go outside and talk. Can you do that for me? And you'll come back? I promise, I'll come right back. We're not gonna make it. Hey, don't say that. I'm gonna get us outta here. (UNEASY MUSIC) How's she doing? She's resting. We need to get the hell outta here. Well, we're not driving out. Look, there's only two options. Either we wait it out and wait for somebody to find us. STEVE: It's never gonna happen. Or, one of us hikes to the highway to flag someone down. We can't send anybody to the highway, we don't have any water. Which is exactly why one of us has to go. I'll go. No. Why not? Because you're an irresponsible idiot. Fuck you, Steve. - Fuck you, Jay. - Hey, you two, knock it off! If you guys don't put this behind you, then we're not getting out of here.

No, Dad! (SCREAMING) (CRYING) (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) How long are we gonna let him stay out there? As long as he needs. How long is that? He just lost his wife and kid. I think we can give him a few minutes. He's gonna lose a father and a brother if we don't get some fucking water soon. Have you always been like this? Not always. Jay was a sweet young boy. I can't remember a time he didn't have a smile on his face. He used to follow his mother around like a little puppy dog. You two had something special. Yeah, we did. Never really had that with you, Dad. Why is that? We did, you just don't remember. Or you choose to forget. That's bullshit. There's nothing to forget, you weren't around. I tried. No, you didn't. You left when I was 14. I almost never saw you again, until a year after my high school graduation, which you didn't even show up for. You don't understand. No, you don't understand. When you left, you broke her heart. You weren't around. I was there! After all you put her through, she took you back. Did that even matter to you? You didn't deserve her. That's enough. I know, he looks like a sweet old man, huh? He didn't even visit his own wife in the hospital. So it wasn't much of a surprise to anybody that he didn't show up to the funeral. I said, that is enough. No, tell him, Dad. Tell me what? He needs to hear it from you. No. STEVE: She's gone, Dad, you can't protect her forever. Don't, Steven. Mom cheated on him two years before he found out. Is that true? I loved your mother since we were 15 years old. When I found out that she was unfaithful to me, I couldn't believe that she would do that to me. I couldn't stay. What I didn't understand was how much it was gonna effect you and your brother. You knew? I owe you both an explanation about the funeral. No, Dad, you don't. I do, I do. I got dressed, I was ready to go, and I couldn't. 'Cause I realized that if I did I would be admitting that she was gone and I was not ready to do that. I couldn't let her go. This trip, this trip, she and I planned this, the two of us. Your mother and I planned this. She knew she wouldn't be here. She made me promise that I would pull together one last time what was left of our family, and that's what I've been trying to do. Then let's do that. You and I will go together. Dad's gonna stay here with Samantha. Let's pack up a few things. You look good in plaid. What? The suit you wore for your graduation. One more. That's it for food. STEVE: Uh, pack one, leave the rest. Can opener? CHARLES: In one of the drawers here. What's that? What? That? Jesus. (UNEASY MUSIC) Uh, Jay, can you grab my flashlight. It's in my backback. (UNEASY MUSIC) Fuck! JAY: Did you catch it on something? There's a whole bunch of stuff stored back in there. Pictures. What the hell is all this shit. This photo was taken right there. These too. Dad, who the hell did you buy this thing from? Is this the guy? No, that guy's too young. It's an old picture, Dad, look at it again. Nah, this is definitely not him.

This can't be the RV. I read in the newspaper they were gonna destroy it outta respect for the families of the victims. Look at all this shit. This has to be the same one. I remember what happened. The cops pulled over some guy for a traffic stop. When they went inside they found this woman with her hands screwed to the ceiling, scalped. The guy attacked and the cops shot him dead. Jesus Christ, this was his. We're in his goddamn toy box. That explains everything. That explains nothing. JAY: Wait. Please, don't say what I think you're about to say. You're telling me this RV's haunted? And there it is. You of all people should know. Why's that? Because you didn't start the engine when it chewed your Dad's hand off, you didn't throw it in reverse when it ran over Olivia, and your wife, she couldn't have strangled herself to death with a jump rope. She would have passed out first. Okay, so let me get this straight. Uh, a serial killer dies in here, and what? All of a sudden his RV is magically killing people? It's the only thing that makes sense. Wait, that makes sense to you? I told you, bro, this wasn't my fault. (ENGINE RUMBLING) (KNIFE RASPING) (GRUNTING) (CHOKING) Holy shit, Jay!

God dammit! We have to get out of here, we're not safe inside of this thing. How do you suppose we do that, huh? How do we get out of this God forsaken shit box? God dammit! Steve! Steve, what can I do? What do we tell him? What can he do? He can't get in, we can't get out. Send him to the highway, see if he can find help. No. Why not? Look at him, that's fucking why not. He's gotta try. He won't make it. He's the only chance we have! He'll die. If he doesn't, he's gonna die anyway. Let me try. I don't know, Dad, do you think you can make it? (UNEASY MUSIC) Yeah. Yeah, I can. Don't worry about us. I know you'll do your best. I love you, Dad. I love you too, son. You watch your back. We gotta find a way outta here. I don't know what this thing's capable of. What's happening? I don't know. Why are you doing that? I'm not doing it. I can't fucking control it. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) I can't fucking control it. Don't! I'm not doing it! Stop that.
