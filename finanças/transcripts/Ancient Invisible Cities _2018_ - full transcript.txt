The world's ancient cities still contain many surprises and treasures, hidden from view for centuries. Now, with the latest scanning technology, I'm going to reveal the secrets of three of the most fascinating cities on Earth. Athens, the birthplace of democracy.... ..Istanbul, the crossroads between Europe and Asia... ..and in this programme, the gateway to Ancient Egypt, Cairo. Today, Cairo is home to over 20 million people. That's over double the population of Greater London. And as the capital of modern Egypt, it's a city that fills the horizon. Its streets, noisy, frenetic with hustle and bustle. But so much of Cairo's past is invisible. Buried deep within its giant pyramids, mysterious towers and ancient fortresses. 45 metres deep up to the sky. These monuments today are surrounded by the city of Cairo, but don't be fooled - these pyramids were here long before Cairo was a twinkle in Egypt's eye. I'll be working with our 3-D scan team to discover how precisely the pyramids were built, thousands of years ago... ..and investigate the riddle of the Sphinx. Is it the face of a real pharaoh? But the history of Cairo isn't all Ancient Egyptians. I'm also going in search of a Roman fortress hidden under the modern city. Wow... Exploring deep below the Arabic citadel, where no tourist ventures. I can hardly actually get a look over the edge. It's still quite a way down. Just sit down. Oh! And I'll be using virtual reality to reveal the ancient world in a whole new way. Welcome to invisible Cairo. Subtitles By Â©AMC.Karl63 The life-giving Nile, a spine running through the whole of Egypt, right through the centre of the city of Cairo. This is the longest river in the world. Egyptians used to say that its source was in the stars, but it's actually in the African Great Lakes about 4,000 miles to the south. It truly is a spectacle of Mother Nature. Over millennia, the Nile has flooded every year and transformed arid desert into fertile fields. 5,000 years ago, the Ancient Egyptians built their capital city, Memphis, on the Nile at a point where the river splits up into the many channels of the Nile Delta. Today, Cairo is also sited close to this strategic position. Throughout its history, this region has been ruled by many empires. But one iconic shape, built by its very first civilisation, defines the Cairo skyline. The Great Pyramid is the last remaining Wonder Of The Ancient World. We're so used to seeing images of the pyramids that they can become all too familiar, like we can almost discount them before we see them. And yet, when you approach the Great Pyramid, you realise, once again, just how incredible this building is. It shuts out the sky. It's a... It's a man-made mountain standing right in front of you. This place was no city or settlement. This place was the burial ground of kings and queens of Ancient Egypt. And this was the biggest of them all. The Great Pyramid of Giza was built over 4,500 years ago, around 2560 BC. 20,000 workers constructed it. But it was the last resting place for just one man, a pharaoh called Khufu. Our scanning project to peel back the layers of history in Cairo begins here. The scan team is going to create a 3-D computer model to help reveal the secrets of its design. They're led by Will Trossell. Will! Hard at work already? Good to see you. So, in the face of the greatest challenge yet, are you guys going to be able to cope? Well, it is a challenge and a half. I think the temperature is pretty killer out here and it has all sorts of problems with our machinery and with us. The ultimate challenge against the ultimate building. What's the goal? What's your primary goal? The scans are incredibly accurate. They're millimetre-perfect and we'll be able to put all of our scans together to reveal the accuracy and precision at which they put together the pyramid. Through our 3-D scans, we'll discover how exact the Ancient Egyptians could be using stone hammers and copper chisels. Will is also keen to scan inside the pyramid. We can take our scanner slowly through all those chambers and through those passages, and connect them together. We'll be able to tell you exactly where you are inside compared to where we are outside here. Fantastic. Good luck to you. Thank you. It's going to be a great fun challenge ahead. I'll see you inside. We'll see you in there. It's certainly a challenge. At 137 metres tall, and made out of 2.3 million stone blocks, the Great Pyramid is still the heaviest building in the world. I'm going in through the Robbers' Entrance, a tunnel dug by looters, probably just a few centuries after the pyramid was built. Beyond this, in the centre of the pyramid, is a spectacular ceremonial space called the Grand Gallery. Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass is my guide. How very nice to see you. Tell me about the extraordinary stonework around us? That's really the Grand Gallery, which is a most fascinating structure inside the Great Pyramid of Khufu. If you look at how it was built, you find there is nine huge blocks. All of this are fine limestone. The pyramid was a national project of the whole nation. It is a work of magic, isn't it? It is. The nine-metre tall walls of the Grand Gallery lean inwards to accentuate their height. It's built to impress and leads up to the tomb of the king. Now I take you to the burial chamber. What an extraordinary experience. The burial chamber is high up in the very heart of the pyramid. This is where Pharaoh Khufu was finally laid to rest. This really feels like a place we weren't supposed to find, Zahi. HE LAUGHS Wow! Magic, isn't it? The stonework is beautiful! Everything here built of granite. This tomb is now almost empty. Any treasures that were here, stolen by grave-robbers. The mummified body is also gone, but one object remains. And this, I presume, is the sarcophagus? Yeah. What would the ceremony have been like when they sealed him in? When the king died, they mummified the king. And after that, they bring the king to the north entrance and they bury the king. That took ceremony for 70 days. 70 days? From the death of the king until they put him inside the sarcophagus here. They brought the king here so that he would be...he would have a home for the afterlife? The king would live in this palace. And therefore, the king became God and he lives in his palace for immortality. Zahi tells me there's another chamber deep below the pyramid. It's closed to the public, but we've been granted special permission to explore it. I've come about 50 metres now down this tunnel, heading diagonally downwards. The, eh... It's getting very hot, very airless, very dusty. Oh! I'm heading down to the subterranean chamber. Nobody's quite sure what it was used for. Where are we here? Oh! Coming down and down and down, it feels like into... ..almost a journey to the centre of the Earth down here. I'm trying not to think about the 2.3 million blocks that are above my head. But this place is... I mean, this is the solid bedrock here that's has been carved out. It's much rougher, much... ..less obvious what this place was intended to be than the king's tomb up above. What were they thinking? What were they planning? Some Egyptologists believe it was built to be the burial chamber, but dropped in favour of the king's tomb. Others think it might have been a decoy, to fool grave-robbers. The first scans of the Great Pyramid are in, and I'm hoping they'll shed some light on the mystery and make sense of its layout. The reveal! Yeah, these are really quite incredible. So, we've taken all of the scans that we've done, stitched them all together, both inside and outside the pyramid. We can start to sort of dive into some of those secrets that the scans are really opening up for us. It feels like this is all empty space, but this is actually solid rock we're viewing from at the moment. The tunnels and the chambers - those are the empty spaces you can actually walk through. Yeah. So where did we come in? Can we go to...? Yeah. So, here you can see the Robbers' Tunnel and compare that to the actual structure of the designed, intended descending passageway down to that subterranean room. And the difference there between them is remarkable. One's like a gnarled piece of ginger, and the other one looked like this precision, crafted tube that goes right down into the core of the pyramid. Phenomenal. We can also see how deep that subterranean chamber is relative to the others, which are much higher up in the pyramid. Of course, cos we went deep under the ground level, didn't we? Absolutely, yeah. It sort of felt almost endless descending that passage. Can we go into the chamber, where we were? Yeah. It has very curious shape and form. It's even clearer now just how rough the subterranean chamber is compared to the king's tomb above. So as we come up the Grand Gallery we come towards the entrance to the King's Chamber. And then this beautiful, incredibly clean, incredibly powerful room, the King's Chamber, here. What an amazing piece of architecture inside the pyramid. The scans should show us where the chambers and tunnels lie in relation to one another. So we're looking right down from the top, right down at the pinnacle of the pyramid. Mm. And you can see how they all kind of align. It's quite incredible how accurately the shafts and chambers go straight into the heart of the pyramid. It makes me inclined to think that there's nothing accidental or mistaken about this building. Whatever that subterranean chamber was for, it had a purpose from the get-go. Everything's been planned to perfection. Will has created a red band at a specific height around the base of the pyramid to measure how level it is. The band shows that all four corners sit within just ten centimetres of each other, despite being hundreds of metres apart. The pyramid is almost exactly level. There was a real master plan here. Everything was thought through and considered, and probably approved by the pharaoh himself. So, it's really only now, with this 21st-century technology, that we're able to applaud them as much as they deserve for their brilliance, all that 4,500 years ago. Oh, it's absolutely remarkable. Now that the skill of the Ancient Egyptian engineers has been confirmed, we're going to apply our scanning technology to a new mystery. It involves the most famous and enigmatic sculpture in the world. It's only when you get up this close and personal to the Sphinx that you realise its tremendous size, towering over 20 metres above my head, carved out of the solid rock. It's the recumbent body of a lion with the head of a man. And when this sculpture was carved at the time of the pyramids here at Giza, it was the largest man-made sculpture anywhere for hundreds of years to come. But whose face is it? The Sphinx sits at the foot of a ceremonial road leading up to the second, middle pyramid of Giza, close to the Great Pyramid. This was built for the pharaoh, Khafre. And he was the son of Khufu, buried next door. The Sphinx was traditionally believed to represent Khafre, a brazen act of self-promotion. But in 2003, some researchers argued Khafre had instead built to honour his father, Khufu. We will scan the face of the Sphinx and compare it with sculptures of Khafre and Khufu... ..in an attempt to answer the age-old riddle... Who is the Sphinx? The famous pyramids of Giza have their origins elsewhere. To understand what inspired their architects, we need to head 20km south. We're travelling across the vast, sprawling city of modern Cairo, but we're actually making a very ancient journey from the burial ground, the Necropolis at Giza, back to the centre of power, the city of Memphis. The pharaohs of the Old Kingdom ruled from Memphis. It had a population of about 30,000 people. It might not sound like many, but 4,500 years ago, Memphis was one of the biggest cities in the world. It was a cosmopolitan trading hub packed with palaces, temples, workshops and emporiums, so little of which has survived today. But this extraordinary statue gives us some sense of its glory and splendour. This is a statue of the pharaoh, Ramesses II, that once stood over ten metres tall, one of a pair guarding the entrance to a temple. Made mostly of mud bricks, the city of Memphis has crumbled away to dust. But just 3km away, the Ancient Egyptians built something that would endure. The stepped pyramid of Saqqara. It was completed about 80 years before the Great Pyramid. The earliest large-scale cut-stone construction anywhere in the world. I can't wait to explore inside. Yasmin, salaam alaykum. Alaykum salaam. Egyptologist Yasmin El Shazly knows this place well. This is the earliest pyramid in Egypt. It actually marks the transition from mud-brick architecture to large-scale stone architecture. So, this is the first pyramid built in Ancient Egypt? Yes. And it's the Pyramid of Djoser, King Djoser of the Third Dynasty. And before they built this one, kings were buried in mastaba tombs, which are basically flat platforms. And what was motivating this massive step change? Well, there were different theories. One of them was that it was kind of a stairway to Heaven for the soul of the king to ascend to unite with the northern stars. And another theory is that he wanted to build a huge monument that could be seen from Memphis. So, your tomb was ever visible on the horizon... Exactly. ..from the city. We must be eight metres or so below the ground here, and the stonework has turned into solid bedrock. I mean, we're literally going under the ground! It's amazing. We've been allowed to explore and scan this unique pyramid. Yasmin, I have to say, with all the scaffolding holding up the roof above us... Yeah. ..it feels like the pyramid's actually under construction! Well, it's closed to the public for restoration, so you're very lucky. But be very careful. It feels like we're in the middle of some kind of Indiana Jones movie now. Yeah. These planks are not very stable. That's an understatement and THAT is a very deep hole. OK. Right, right. That's a big one! Look at this. Wow! This is the shaft that leads to the burial chamber. And it's 28 metres deep. Wow! So, this is carved out of... The bedrock. ..the solid bedrock? Yeah. Imagine the amount of work. Further down, it's a labyrinth of tunnels, corridors, shafts and chambers. Watch your head! Be careful! Oh, my Lord! Yasmin is taking me to a small antechamber that can tell us more about why the first pyramid was built. Come here, come. I want to show you something. Look at these chambers, they were all covered with these blue faience tiles. Wow! So you can see the preparation of the wall, can't you, for all of the tiles. Yeah, yes. And there's some more here. Yeah. Unfortunately, these are all gone. You can see more here. So, this room would have been bright blue, sort of shining blue, like the open sky! Exactly. Many metres above our head! Yes. It would have been incredible. They were designed to, uh, mimic the king's palace, because, to the Ancient Egyptians, the tomb was the house of eternity. Just like all later pyramids, this first pyramid represented a palace for the afterlife. And it was all for an early pharaoh, King Djoser, back in 2650 BC. He must've been an incredible king, because we know that he had successful military campaigns, and he was also the first to build a pyramid. Many people think of the Ancient Egyptians as people who eh, were in love with death, and that's not really true. They were in love with life and that's why they wanted life after death to be just like life on Earth. I think it might be time to head up to the land of the living again. Yeah, I think I'll join you. But I'm definitely going to follow you cos I have absolutely no idea how to get out of here. Will and his team are already at work. They plan to map out this intricate warren of chambers and tunnels, more accurately than ever before... ..and discover how its design went on to inspire the Great Pyramid. While they scan, I'm exploring the Egyptian Museum in the centre of Cairo to find out more about King Djoser. But first, I can't resist the most beautiful archaeological object of Ancient Egypt. It's easy to get "pharaoh fever" as it's known, in this museum, an overload of Egyptology. But then, you see this. The death mask of Tutankhamun, made out of gold. 11 kilos in weight and laid with precious stones such as lapis lazuli, for the eyebrows and the eyelids. The face is a realistic portrayal of the pharaoh it once sat over the top of, because his soul needed to be able to find the body again to re-inhabit it in the afterlife. Tutankhamun died around the age of 20, but during his short reign, he's said to have restored order to a country in turmoil. But all of this was happening many centuries after the building of the first pyramid. And now, what I've really come to see, a unique object discovered at the stepped pyramid. The only complete sculpture we have of that pyramid pioneer, King Djoser. He's not as bling is Tutankhamun, but he's over a thousand years older and something very special. This is the oldest life-size statue ever found in Ancient Egypt. It seems Djoser was a revolutionary, not just an architecture with his pyramid, but in art, as well. And it was coated in white plaster. You can still see the remnants of it here and then painted. You can see on his beard and the hair. And his eyes were probably inset with some of precious stone or jewel, although now long since lost. The Cairo Museum also contains a full wall of those blue tiles that we saw in Djoser's pyramid. Here you can see the faience tiling in all its glory from the tomb at Saqqara. It's supposed to resemble the rush mats that once adorned the walls of the palace of the pharaoh while he was alive. For me, it's just another symbol about the way in which they invested so much more in their afterlife than they ever did in their lives. As well as these preparations for his home in the afterlife, King Djoser also seems to have been keen to demonstrate his ongoing right to rule. If a pharaoh ruled for more than 30 years, he had to perform the Heb Sed. It was a ritual designed to prove his athletic and his mental ability and power to continue. It was a race around this enormous arena followed by a wrestling match. Woh! And the thing about Djoser is that he built his pyramid with the Heb-Sed track just behind it. He wasn't just going to do this during his lifetime, he was going to do it for all eternity. The construction of the first pyramid was a feat of ancient innovation. But our scans reveal that it went through different design stages. The six steps of the structure stand out clearly. But at the bottom layer, you can make out a join between two sections. Tease this apart and you find a smaller burial tomb, known as a mastaba tomb, hidden inside. This was built first. But at some point, the mastaba was expanded into the full six-storey, stepped pyramid. Also unlike the Great Pyramid at Giza, our scans show that all the interior spaces were built deep below ground level, including the huge central shaft leading down to the burial chamber. Right next to here is the small antechamber with the beautiful blue tiles. The confusing labyrinth of tunnels under the stepped pyramid may reflect the builders' experimentation along the way. We didn't scan all the tunnels. There's an estimated 6km of them, all very different from the more streamlined Great Pyramid. The stepped pyramids at Saqqara ushered in a whole new era of monumental tomb architecture. But within a very short space of time, just 80 years, this magnificent structure behind me would look like little more than a prototype because the engineers and architects of Ancient Egypt had managed to super-size the pyramids and create the Great Pyramid at Giza. That's where I'm back off now. Building the Great Pyramid was a massive undertaking, lasting 20 years. Until recently, little was known about the workers who built it. It's long been assumed the majority were slaves. Then, in 1990, these tombs were found completely buried in the sand just next to the pyramids. Zahi Hawass suspected they might belong to some of the workmen who built the pyramids. And we come face-to-face with the image of one of those workmen here. Yes. His name is Petety. I think he was an artist. One of the people who were decorating the tombs. OK. But what's really amazing about this tomb is this inscription. The man is saying, "I never did anything wrong in my life," which is a big liar! And he said, "This is why the gods like me." And after that he said here, "If anyone will touch my tomb... "..he will be eaten by crocodile, the hippo and the lion." Wow! Amazing! The curse worked. It did work, yeah. It saved his tomb. For the first time, we have ideas and knowledge about the workmen who built the pyramids. It tells us that the builders of the pyramids were not slaves, that they were buried beside the pyramid and they were Egyptians. Thanks to excavations like this, we now know that the people who built the pyramids were free men... ..and carvings in the walls of the tombs show how the 20,000-strong workforce was kept going. Bakers who made the bread, and brewers of the all-important beer. The tomb that Zahi is showing me belonged to skilled artisan Petety. Petety was an artist. He maybe decorated the tombs, he was able to make beautiful scenes. Look at the beauty of the profile of his wife. Look at how Petety has drawn the face of his wife. I have a question for you. Do you think that she was happy with the drawing that her husband did of her? Yes. She's beautiful. But you have to know, she did not look like this. This is what she wanted to be in the afterlife. But what is good about Petety, he did not draw the scene of his wife as small, like you see in every tomb. She is almost... They are equal... Equal to him. ..on either side of... And behind you, is the main chamber of the two. And that is an indication that he was in love with her. Or she was stronger than him. That's a lovely sign to see in the chamber where they would be buried together for eternity. Exactly. If we think about the workers of Ancient Egypt, we almost always think about what they built, the Great Pyramid. That great community project. But here in their tombs and looking at the images carved by Petety of him and his wife, you start to think of them as individuals, as people with hopes, dreams, ambitions, pride at the their own achievements. And you start to imagine them and their lives as they lived them. And that image of Petety and his wife as a marriage of equals will be one that stays with me for my entire life. Earlier, we scanned the Sphinx to investigate the mystery of which pharaoh it represents. The two candidates were Khafre or his father, Khufu. Now, we're returning to the Cairo Museum to scan their sculptures. This is Pharaoh Khafre. It's a beautiful statue made of diorite, which is a very hard stone, it comes from southern Egypt, in Aswan. Despite the hardness of the stone, the sculptor has been able to create the exact intense musculature of Khafre's arms. This is a powerful ruler with his ceremonial skirt, his beard and his headdress. And this is Khufu, his father. But the sculpture is absolutely tiny. It's just 7.5 centimetres high. Beautifully carved in ivory. And we know it's Khufu because his name is there right on the front, which makes this the only certain surviving representation of the man who had the Great Pyramid at Giza built for him as his home in the afterlife. It's striking that the man with the biggest pyramid has got the smallest statue of himself. Using digital design technology, we can compare the faces of the two pharaohs with that of the Sphinx. What kind of precision are we talking? What level are you scanning at? As accurate as we can go. So really trying to get in on the pores and all that, if that detail was there. The pharaoh will never have been looked at in such close detail and scrutiny before. Absolutely, yeah, absolutely, yeah. This is the scan of Khafre. The face of the Sphinx is superimposed on top, scaled to the exact same size. We ignore the nose, as it's missing from the Sphinx. The blue and red areas show points where the faces are most different. The green and yellows, a closer match. And this is a scan of Khufu, the father, with the Sphinx's face also overlaid, accurate to 0.5 of a millimetre. By comparing the two, we can see there's slightly more green and yellow on Khafre's scan, especially along his cheeks and chin. It's a closer match. It's not definitive, but our results support the view that the Sphinx is Khafre, the son, rather than Khufu. This suggests Khafre built the Sphinx, not to honour his father, but to boost his own ego... ..for eternity. The pharaohs ruled over the land of the Nile for over 2,000 years. And when the time of Ancient Pharaonic Egypt finally ended, Egypt was to be subject to periods of when it was master of its own fate and when it was under the thumb of others, the Persians, the Greeks, and, finally, the Romans, who arrived with a military force to be reckoned with. The Romans occupied Egypt in 31 BC. A turning point in the history of the country, as it heralded the end of an independent Ancient Egypt. It was absorbed into the Roman Empire and quickly became her breadbasket. Egypt was said to feed the citizens of Rome for four months out of every year. May I? It's still very hot, coming out of the oven you can see... Wow! You can see the steam coming out of it. This will be taken directly on these boards and transported across the city by bike and every other form of transport, so that everyone gets their bread as fresh as possible. Look at that! Mm! That is brilliant! For millennia, whoever controlled the head of the Nile Delta could also control trade and the supply of wheat from the fertile lands along the Nile. That's why Memphis was sited here. And now, the Romans station themselves close by at a place called Babylon, named after the original city in Mesopotamia. It was a defining moment for the development of the future city of Cairo. I'm walking down a street in Old Cairo, which follows the route of the Nile, back in Ancient Roman times. Now, today, there's the metro on one side of me and a church on the other, but I've been told that this location hides something very special indeed. Archaeologist Peter Sheehan has been studying this site for nearly 30 years. Peter, how are you? Hello, Michael. Good to see you. Nice to see you, too. Welcome to Old Cairo. Thank you. And to this fantastic Greek Orthodox Church. The Church of St George, Mari Girgis. I saw a fantastic George and the Dragon outside and we've got another one. There he is. But we're here to talk about Romans. Romans! Romans. If you want to come this way. OK, I'm following you. Wow! So, the thing about this church is that it's built over a Roman tower. A window onto another world. I mean, my Lord! You can see there's one floor below us and there's another floor below that. How far down does that go? 16 metres, three storeys, preserved more or less completely intact. How do we get there? We use the stairs, of course. This way. Now, this is getting pretty confusing. Peter, what's...? Help me understand where we are now. This is a Roman tower. So, this is standing here...? All the way to the top. That is the 16 metres we were looking at from above. How extraordinary! Peter is taking me into the heart of the tower. From here, we're to go through into the kind of central section, which was really effectively a light well. These are the ground floor columns of the Roman tower. They're still in place. They have been chopped off and basically used as a foundation, in fact, in medieval period. And that's where we were standing in the church. Right up at the top, yes. The overwhelming impression, for me at least, is of the sheer might and power of the structure. Not too many frills. It's all solid and kind of built to last and probably built by the legionaries. After the fall of Rome, Christians in the 7th century AD used the abandoned tower as the foundations for a church, the only circular church in Egypt. Later, in 1909, this new Orthodox church was built on top of the old one. While the scan team sets to work, Peter is keen to show me evidence nearby that the Roman tower is part of something much bigger. We've got another round structure here. Another round tower, Michael. Another round tower. The exact... The mirror image of the other one. Wow! And as we go through, we see something which you've seen before. The light well with a lot more like in it! So, I mean, these look absolutely... This looks absolutely identical to the one we were in before. If you look at the plan, it's an exact mirror image of the other tower, set 29 metres apart. So this is part of a larger structure, a fortress? OK. I'm finding this really hard to visualise now. How can we...? Have you got something that might be of...? I hope this helps a little. Oh, a plan! Now...! So, you show me where we are, then. I think we're here. You're right. That's the south round tower. OK. And here are the walls, this is the fortress. So what we're looking at, the two towers form the western side of the Fortress of Babylon. And then this is the Nile. This is the Nile. The street where we were just walking up was actually the line of the Nile. The fortress enclosed a harbour which led off the River Nile... ..and guarded the entrance to a 170-kilometre canal that linked the Mediterranean to the Red Sea, via the Nile, like an early version of the Suez Canal. From 300 AD, the Babylon Fortress dominated this region and was the nucleus for the eventual city of Cairo. I want to see if the scans can tease out the extraordinary history of these very different buildings. At the top is the Orthodox church, with its ornately painted interior. Deep in the foundations is the Roman tower. When you take away the church superstructure, you see more clearly that this circular tower is the mirror of its sister. The two towers are on either side of the entrance to the harbour, guarding the meeting place of the River Nile and the Red Sea Canal. Our computer reconstruction reveals the full extent of the whole fortress, 400 metres by 200 metres. Large enough to hold a garrison of 1,000 men. This has been a truly remarkable story. Hiding under this Greek church, a Roman tower. Part of a much bigger fortress, with a harbour connected to a massive canal. A vital lynch pin, not just in the Roman organisation and defence of their world, but in the trading highways, byways and waterways of a connected ancient world. The Romans dominated the land of the pharaohs for over 600 years. But by the 7th century AD, a new empire was rising in the east. In 642, the Arabs conquered Egypt, bringing many new influences from the Middle East and beyond. The religion of Islam was just 20 years old at the time, yet it would define the developing culture of this city. These two minarets stand at the boundary of the old city. Memphis had crumbled away to dust. Roman Egypt had given way to Islamic Egypt. Then different Arab factions fought for control over Egypt for hundreds of years. In the 10th century, Arab rulers established a new capital at the head of the Nile Delta, Cairo. The origins, the name of the city of Cairo are obscure and hotly debated but one story is this. That the Fatimid Arab invaders of Egypt, who founded this city, wanted it to be a city from which they would go on to conquer the world. And so they called it Al Qahirah, the victorious, the conqueror. And that word "Al Qahirah" has become westernised to Cairo. One of the greatest leaders of Arab Egypt was Saladin, the scourge of the Crusaders. Shortly after he secured power in Egypt in 1171, he built a citadel, part palace, part fortress, part mosque, in a commanding position over the city of Cairo. To find out more, I'm meeting Jehan Reda, an expert in Arabic architecture. Hi, Michael. How are you? Very nice to see you. Nice to see you, too. We're in the middle of Saladin's citadel. Yes. And it's a monumental structure. Definitely. What was in his mind when he decided to build on this scale? Well, I think that his most urgent concern was defence, really. He had skirmishes and battles with the Crusaders and this was continuous, campaigns and counter campaigns. So there was a real concern here for defence and protecting the city of Cairo. And, of course, from a military point of view, this is the highest ground. It's this way. Jehan is going to show me one of Cairo's secret places, the Well of the Spiral. This well was built to supply water to the defenders of the citadel, when cut off from the Nile in times of siege. We're now going below... We're going all the way down to the level of the Nile. Straight through the rock of the mountain? Straight through, yes. The well has been closed for quite some time now because of accidents happening. Oh, you can get a sense of it here, can't you? Yes, through the windows. So, is this a spiral staircase going round the whole... Yes. ..the whole outside? It's all around, all the way down. Do we have any sense of who the workers were? Well, we have an eyewitness account that saw a large number of Crusader prisoners. So Crusader prisoners... That's right. ..captured by Saladin, put to work on... Put to work here. Are we there? Oh... Yes, we are almost there. Wow! We're 45 metres down here. We're actually standing on the roof of the second shaft. It's below us. I was going to ask. There's no water here. There's another shaft? There's the one right below. Directly below. How did they get the water up such an enormous distance? Well, they used a mechanism that has been used in Egypt since... ..time immemorial. There was one right here, actually. Right behind you. I can see why you said, bring some torches, as well! It gets dark over here, doesn't it? It does. This is Saladin's water wheel? This is the water wheel. So, you have this horizontal wheel, powered by the oxen that walks around in a circle driving it and you can see how it sits... Hang on. The oxen?! Yes. Where do oxen fit in down here? Well, they brought them down here a little bit young, through the spiral staircase... Where we walked...? ..where we just descended. Yes. And they'd be harnessed and would go round in a circle, while it actually turns the vertical wheel you see here. Yeah. And this wheel would have rope slung over it that go all the way down the second shaft... To bring the water... ..to bring the water up in cups. So, can we get down into the second shaft? Yes, you can. On your own. With the help of a climbing expert, I'm leaving Jehan behind to explore the lower half of the well. So, that hole there is... Yeah. ..is open, and if you fell down, you could go right the way down the hole. OK. I can see now why Jehan did not want to join me on this part of the tour. I can hardly actually get a look over the edge because there is absolutely nothing here stopping me from the shaft. That looks a long way down and every time I move my feet and send some piece of rubble falling off, you get a nice sound of it hitting the water several seconds later, which tells me it's still quite a way down. Further down, a section of the 800-year-old steps has largely crumbled away. Oh! I've finally reached the level of the Nile. This water would have been a precious resource back in Saladin's day. It must have been cleaner back then, too. You see Saladin's citadel walls and you think, "Impressive!" But it's when you come down here, deep under the ground, that you are completely awestruck by the engineering power and might of that man to construct something like this! And, at the same time, I'm struck with a sense of, well, awe for the individual workers, those Crusader captives, whose job it was to hew this out of the stone one piece at a time. The well appears roughly hacked out of the rocks, but our scans will reveal the clever engineering behind it all. The citadel sits high on its outcrop. As you come down, you see just how far the well shaft has to descend to reach the water table - a remarkable 90 metres through solid bedrock. Look how the two sections of the well fit together, with the middle platform for the water wheel mechanism and those ever-circling oxen. From there, the water would be lifted up through the top section to come out into reservoirs like this. The Well of the Spiral helped to ensure those in the citadel could withstand a long siege. For 700 years, from the time of Saladin until the mid-19th century, the seat of government was the Citadel of Cairo. For the second half of this period, Egypt was occupied by the Ottomans and then the French, as it would be later by the British. In 1953, Cairo finally became the capital of the Independent Republic of Egypt. But of all the cultures that ruled this region, the one that continues to feed the imagination and inspire the modern people of Egypt is the civilisation of the Ancient Egyptians. And that's largely due to the architectural jewel in Cairo's crown, the Great Pyramid. Now our scans allow me to re-enter this world in a new way, using virtual reality. It looks like you are bringing me to some kind of magical, technical treasure trove in here. Michael, welcome to our virtual studio. I feel like I'm embarking on a unique adventure. So, where are we going first? We thought we would give you a bit an overview of the Great Pyramid, so let's dive in and sort of dissect the inside. I can't wait to see this! I'm standing inside the middle of the Great Pyramid! Can I...? I can just... I can! I can just put my head out and touch the wall! How extraordinary is this? Poke back in. So, we can just seamlessly wander through the inner core of the pyramid. You can't help, at this level, just want to hold the King's Chamber in your hand. Michael, to be true virtual archaeologists, we should be crawling through this. We're standing in the middle of the tunnel, aren't we? Hang on a sec. Let's get down. God, yes, I remember this. Here we go. Oh, here we are. Back into the King's Chamber. It's an incredible space. Although it seems very simple, the engineering required to make the space inside a huge structure is sort of incredible, really. I feel like we've almost taken on the spirit of the pharaoh, as we wander in and out of chambers and up and down through the pyramid and in and out. We're seeing perhaps what they hoped they would be seeing in eternity. We went right down, didn't we, to the subterranean chamber? Hang on a sec. They are absolutely aligned, aren't they? And when you think about them doing this 4,500 years ago, that is phenomenal. So, Michael, we've shrunk the pyramid down, so we can have this godly-like view of the outside and the inside. Of the whole Giza Plateau, isn't it? The whole enclosure. And you see the pyramids there, and then you can just walk with a lot more ease than we did in the heat, as we were heading across the complex, we can head over to the Sphinx. Looking down on one of the Wonders Of The Ancient World. And what a privilege and a wonder to see it like this. What really strikes me about the city of Cairo is the way it contains this immense span of human history. When the Romans came here, they were confronted by the monuments of the Ancient Egyptians that were already older to them than the Romans are to us today. I've discovered how the city at the head of the Nile Delta evolved from Memphis to Babylon to Cairo. And how successive empires built colossal structures to mark and control this region, the most important place in the whole of Egypt for 5,000 years. All of which makes Cairo such a magical city. In the Arabian Nights, a father says to his son, "He who has not seen Cairo has not seen the world. "Because Cairo IS the world." Next time, Athens. I investigate an ancient silver mine... I think I'm through. ..peel back the layers of history beneath the modern city streets... What a magic, hidden, invisible world underneath this apartment! ..and explore the secrets of the Acropolis. There's a wall, there's a wall, there's a wall! Whoa, whoa! We just went through the wall. If you'd like to explore the Great Pyramid for yourself in 3-D, log on to... ..and follow the link. The world's ancient cities still contain many surprises and treasures hidden from view for centuries. Now, with the latest scanning technology, I'm revealing the secrets of three of the most fascinating cities on Earth. Cairo, the gateway to ancient Egypt. Istanbul, the crossroads between Europe and Asia. And in this programme, Athens, the birthplace of democracy. Today, Greater Athens is home to almost four million people. It's a city that has exploded with life over the past century and, as a result, ancient sites and monuments sit cheek by jowl with modern architecture and urban renewal. It's an intoxicating mix of ancient and modern clashing together. The temples of ancient Athens dominate the city skyline, but I'm also exploring its hidden secrets, buried deep beneath the modern streets. I thought I knew Athens, but I've never been in a place quite like this. I'll be working with our 3D scanning team... We're going to be scanning the edges of the water so we're going to take to the air. ..to reveal the secrets of Athens' ancient past... ..and to explore its brilliant golden age. In which the citizens of Athens created an idea that we still cherish over 2,500 years later. Democracy. I'll be exploring ancient silver mines... What a world. Whoa! Whoa! ..and using virtual reality to discover this amazing city in a whole new way. You wonder what they've been staring at for the past 2,500 years. Athens is a city with layer after layer of history and mythology. The ancients knew this place as the City of the Gods. Welcome to Invisible Athens. The Acropolis a sacred hill in the centre of Athens. 5,000 years ago, its cliffs offered protection to Bronze Age settlers, and in the centuries that followed, the city grew up around it. At the end of the sixth century BC, a remarkable event took place here. The people of Athens overthrew a tyrant on this hillside and started to create the world's first democracy. In the golden era that followed, the Athenians built the beautiful monuments that sit here today. I'm walking through the Propylaea, the ancient gateway to the Acropolis. It was designed to funnel your vision down until it exploded out again to reveal one of the most important buildings in human history. The Parthenon. It was built to honour the goddess Athena, and on first impressions, this beautiful temple is a model of order and symmetry. But when you look closer, it becomes even more impressive. And that's because there's barely a straight vertical line on it. Each of its 46 columns curves out and then tapers almost imperceptibly inwards as it rises. This architectural trick is what gives the Parthenon its grace and power... ...and creates the illusion of a temple always reaching for the heavens. It's not just the beauty of this building that strikes you. It's the powerful message and purpose that it was intended to convey. It's civilisation versus barbarism, with this building and the city that it's at the centre of as the beating heart of civilisation. Sitting in the shadow of the Parthenon is another, smaller temple. It's often overlooked, but it's no less significant, and we're going to find out why this is one of the most important buildings of ancient Athens. The Parthenon is renowned for its symmetry, but the same cannot be said of its eccentric little brother just across the way. This is the Erechtheion today, but in ancient times it was simply known as "the building in which the statue of Athena is". But it's also the most asymmetrical building in ancient Greece. It's all different bits of architecture that have sort of been higgledy-piggledy smashed together in all sorts of weird ways. And so the question is, why did they design a building to look like this? Our 3D scanners are going to try to make sense of this intriguing temple. The team is led by architect Matt Shaw. So, Matt, we've got this uniquely asymmetrical building. How are we going to tackle that with the 3D laser scanning? Well, you have this complete clarity over there with the Parthenon and here, you're right, this complexity and almost this confusion, so the first thing for us to do is just to map it really well, to understand the geometry of the Acropolis site itself, and then we'll see exactly how the Erechtheion is embedded into that site. To reveal more about the Erechtheion's setting, Matt and his team are going to create a 3D model of the whole Acropolis. Using thousands of aerial photographs and a digital process called photogrammetry, they'll be trying to reveal why the Athenians designed the Erechtheion in this way. And while they get to work, I'm going to take a closer look. The temple gets its name from Erechtheus, a mythical king of Athens. He's said to have been killed here by a thunderbolt thrown by Zeus, king of the gods. This confusing building becomes even more confusing when we realise that the ancient Greeks purposefully left a hole in the roof and a hole in the floor. The mythical explanation for this is this was the point where Zeus's thunderbolt came from the sky and killed Erechtheus. But the connection with Greece's ancient myths doesn't end there. This temple also stands over one of the crucial spots in Athenian mythology the contest between the gods to be the patron deity of the city. Poseidon, the god of the sea, and Athena, the goddess of wisdom, had to pit their powers against each other. Poseidon supposedly struck down into rocks with his trident. And he produced sea water out of nowhere. Not to be outdone, Athena planted an olive tree near the same spot, and the Athenian king who was judging the competition thought that an olive tree would be more useful to the Athenians than sea water, and so declared her the victor. From that moment on, Athena would be the patron deity of Athens. Today, an olive tree planted in 1917 marks the spot where Athena's olive tree once stood. Jutting out of another side of the building is a porch supported by columns in the form of six maidens, known as the Caryatids. This porch, too, was built over more sacred royal ground. We're so used to thinking of the maidens acting as columns, but actually they were guardians of something far more important. Deep beneath their feet, deep down in that corner, the grave, the mythical grave of the founding king of Athens, Cecrops. And so these maidens are doing far more than just holding up the roof above them. They're there in eternity, pouring offerings to this legendary hero. These buildings on the Acropolis have become enduring symbols of the city that gave the world democracy. But to Athenians, these were sacred places for religious worship. The political heart of their city lies elsewhere. Sitting just below the Acropolis is a hill called the Pnyx, and it's my favourite place in Athens. Athenian citizens assembled on this hillside to hear speeches and cast their votes, and if anywhere can lay claim to being the world's first democratic meeting place, then this is it. But this wasn't democracy as we know it. Only Athenian men were classed as citizens. There were no votes for women, nor for Athens' vast workforce of slaves. But while we wouldn't recognise Athenian democracy as democracy, they also wouldn't recognise our system as democracy, because we don't each individually get up and vote on every issue as the Athenians did, and it was on the Pnyx that the very essence of their political system was put into operation a direct vote by every citizen on every issue. Our scan team will be helping to reveal the story of the ancient city that lies beneath the surface of modern Athens. And now they're ready to show me the first scans of the Acropolis. I can't wait to see Athens in all her glory, and particularly the Acropolis. Well, take a seat, and here we are. You can take this kind of helicopter ride around the site here. Yeah. And of course our eyes are immediately attracted towards the Parthenon, the glory piece of the Acropolis. And there it is the eccentric little brother of the Erechtheion, that kind of weirdly designed building sitting next door. Let's take this model apart a little bit, so we're going to... ...we're going to take the Erechtheion away and we'll just be left with the foundations and the marks on the ground, I guess. And here we are. We take ourselves back in time to before that building was even there. What we're left with is this piece of quite undulating terrain. This is not a flat site here. From the south side to the north side, you can see there's this big drop in terrain here this is over three metres, so the site is pretty constrained. So it's got... It's got difficulties of terrain. What about also the pre-existing sacred locations and places that we know were littered around here? So the first of those is this strange little hole in the ground, actually, here. Well, I mean the ancient sources talk about it as Zeus's thunderbolt. There are moments in time and there are specific locations that are really attached to the ground itself. Let's take this little sacred moment on the ground and let's bring in some of the architecture. So we've just popped the North Porch on in a matter of seconds, but we can see this hole in the ceiling that is directly above, and it frames this patch of ground with this sacred hole in the middle of it. It's how the Athenians would have thought about what they were building, that it was visible to the all-seeing gods. But there's something stopping them extending the building. HE LAUGHS It's the olive tree. It's the olive tree. What are you going to do about that? You can't move this olive tree, supposedly Athena's olive tree. You're going to have to work around it. Yeah. And I mean, we do this nowadays, right? We have tree preservation orders. "You're not touching this." "This tree's not going anywhere." No. If we take a sneaky peek beyond Athena's olive tree, there's another sacred site. And so this is the Caryatid Porch, isn't it? That's sitting over the top, we think, of the tomb of Cecrops. Again, the building has to respect it, and it has to be commemorated in some way, and marked. It's layers of history and identity and construction. It's the constraints of the landscape, but it's also the constraints of the sacred places and objects they want to respect. A patch of ground touched by the gods, an olive tree created by Athena, and the tomb of Athens' founding king. Three sacred spots, united around a central temple housing shrines and relics to Athena and many other gods. So when you factor all of those things in, this building becomes an ingenious solution to the problem. Looking at this building, this little...this little gem here, no longer is it the sort of eccentric little brother, it's actually the prime example of what the Athenians could achieve. THEY SPEAK GREEK Today, modern Athens is a vivid and colourful city with a strong connection to the sea. It's the bustling capital of a democracy struggling to keep up with its European neighbours. At the time of the first democracy, before the buildings of the Acropolis rose up, Athens also had to fight to secure its place in the world. In 490 BC, Athens was a Greek city state surrounded by rivals. Places like Aegina, Corinth and the militaristic Sparta. The greatest threats of all, however, lay to the east, where the Persian Empire was growing in power and ambition. But Athens had one great advantage over many of its rivals. The territory it controlled, known as Attica, was rich in natural resources. And beneath these hills, in the region of Laurion, lay extensive seams of silver. This was once an industrial landscape teeming with slaves. And the best way to explore what this world was like is to go inside one of the mines. Shall we go in? Yes. Watch your head. Watch my head, OK. My guide is archaeologist Professor Andreas Kapetanios. He knows these mines better than anyone. When they started digging galleries... Those are the galleries going back there? Some of the galleries, they are like octopus tentacles and they expanded all over the underground world because they tried to figure out where to look for the ore. And that's where we're going? Yeah. OK, well, I'm going to follow you, OK? Because I certainly don't want to get lost down here. We have to crawl here. Narrow and low. Michael, are you coming? I'm on my way...oh! These are actual tunnels that they would have dug in ancient times looking for the silver as they went? Looking for the ore that the silver comes from. If you come over here you will see the deep, um, tool marks. The tool marks all around. This gap here, this tunnel is no more than half a metre in height. I can't imagine how anyone has the work space to move and then actually work at hacking away at the rock with tools. I mean, it's incredibly tight. Andreas, it feels like we're heading downwards now. You see, this is a kind of step, stepping downwards... Yeah. And we find ourselves in a hole. I'll try it headfirst, and hopefully we won't be in too much trouble. My God. Andreas, this is probably the narrowest piece. It's fine, it's fine. It's fine? Yeah! This is officially insane. I have to admit, though, I'm kind of enjoying it. Are you through? I think I'm through. This is incredible! Are you coming? It's sobering to think that the people who dug these tunnels 2,500 years ago were forced to work down here for the benefit of the city of Athens. This was labour done by tens of thousands of slaves. Slaves were captured in wars or they were bought in markets. Slaves were very valuable, valuable tools. We can see pairs of adults and children working together. Children? Yes, yes. Can't help but feel for the people who had to work hard excavating down here in antiquity. You're seeing the real underbelly, the real Athens. With all these tight tunnels and narrow galleries, this is going to be the hardest challenge our scan team have faced yet. I do think we've got a while in here. Yeah. I think we've got about six hours, probably. Really? How are you guys going to manage getting all your scanning equipment through some of these galleries? I mean, it's teamwork, right? One of us has got to creep through these holes and the other one has got to pass the equipment, and then we've got to creep again, and pass again, and creep again, and pass again. I'm now incredibly curious to see some of this silver ore as they would have seen it as they hewed it out of the rock. I can show you a piece. Wow! Oh, it's sparkling. It's beautiful, isn't it? And this is what they were after. But you need four tonnes of this to produce two kilos of silver. That's why they should move mountains of this material. These are the Silicon Valleys of classical Athens. Our scans reveal a labyrinth of tunnels and chambers over 100 metres long. Cut by hand, as the slaves followed a thin seam of silver ore into the hillside. And above ground, the scans also capture the remains of the mine's processing plants. Here, the ore would have been washed, then ground into tiny pebbles before being heated in furnaces nearby to coax out the precious silver. This is just one of at least 30 known silver mines hidden under the hillsides of Laurion, and the sources record that in the 480s BC, the Athenians hit on a new and extremely rich vein of silver which would prove a massive boost to Athens' new democracy. CAR HORN TOOTS How to spend this lucky windfall became a subject of fierce debate amongst the citizens of the city. Many wanted to cash in and give every citizen an equal share of the silver. But one leading politician, a heroic general called Themistocles, put forward a powerful case for investing the money in a fleet of ships to defend the city. The debate over what to do with the Laurion silver was decided by a democratic vote, and as a result, the people poured the money not into their own pockets, but into the building of a fleet and, henceforth, naval muscle and might would be just as important a marker of Athens as the democracy itself. The naval muscle took the form of warships known as triremes, because they were powered by three rows of oars. At 40 metres long, they were light and fast, and fitted with bronze battering rams. They were formidable weapons of war. Here on the waterfronts, we can peel back the layers of history to show the strategic importance of the Athenian fleet to the city over several centuries. The scanning team is already investigating. So how are we going to make the invisible visible this time? Scanning on the inside, relatively easy, but we're not just doing the ruins, we're actually doing this whole apartment building here. And then we're going to be scanning the edges of the water here, but getting a view into the water is tricky for us. So we're going to take to the air for that, so we want to see directly down through that water with a nice high sun, and we're hoping that the structures underneath the water are really going to come to life for us there. While the scan team gets to work outside, I'm going to look inside with marine archaeologist Dr Bjorn Loven. So, Bjorn, we can see the harbour just there in front of us, but where can we get a glimpse of the ancient harbour? Bjorn has investigated the remains of ancient dry docks, known as ship sheds, tucked away in this basement. What a magic, hidden, invisible world underneath... ..underneath this apartment. Yeah, we're so lucky that this has been preserved. Dry-dock ship sheds like this one seem like a simple enough idea, but they were vital to the success of Athens' naval fleet. The best way to show this, that if you stand on this column here... I'll get... OK, I'll get up on this one. Then, over here to the other side. So in this space between us is one ship shed unit. So if I go and stand... If I'm here, I am where the ancient trireme warship...? Yeah, you are in the space. So it really is like a massive parking garage? It is. And we have to imagine that people are pulling the ships up by hand? Yeah. What we actually have here, we have to imagine that right here there would be a line of 70 men... 70 on this side, 70 on that side, all pulling away? Hauling away on big ropes that were attached to the ram of the ship. So they would want to pull the ship up out of the water, not just for repairs, I presume, but also to dry it out? Yeah, the drier and the more well-maintained your ship is, the faster it is in battle, but the most important thing is that they pulled the ships out of the sea to protect it from the evil ship worm that could actually destroy a ship in a matter of months. So it was to ensure that it was a long-lasting, perfectly functioning lethal weapon? Yeah. You could say that the fleet was the backbone of the Athenian democracy. What's becoming much clearer to me now is how, in the ancient world, it was these industrial, commercial areas down on the ports, these ship sheds, where the engines and motors of Athenian power and democracy were housed and maintained, that was the ultimate symbol of both the democratic political system of Athens and the power it projected across the ancient world. Our scans show how the modern apartments are built right on top of the ancient ship sheds. And using data gathered from our drone, we've been able to map remains that reveal how the ship sheds extend under the modern road and into today's harbour. And our graphic shows how they once stood all around this cove. In 480 BC, thanks to their wise investment, the Athenian Navy was 200 warships strong, just as Athens prepared to face a mortal threat from the most powerful empire in the ancient world. Down here in Piraeus, Athens' port, a decisive sequence of events began. An army of at least 200,000 Persian soldiers was on its way to invade Athens and crush its democracy. And with the entire population at risk, the Athenians had to decide whether to stay and fight in the city or to retreat by sea. Themistocles knew the Athenians could never hope to take on the full force of the Persians on land, and so he convinced them to make an extraordinary decision to abandon Athens, to abandon the land of Attica and instead to put all their hopes of survival into the wooden walls of their ships. And on that moment, that decision, that democratic vote did history turn. Women and children were taken to safety and every Athenian man of military age took his place on a trireme and prepared to face the Persians at sea. The Athenians withdrew their fleet just a short distance across the water from the city into a secluded bay where they could plan their next move. Here, they were joined by allies from across Greece, and in late September 480 BC, they prepared to make a stand. The battle that followed, the Battle of Salamis, was the moment the world's first democracy faced its greatest threat. It is one of the major turning points of Western civilisation. And until recently, barely any remains dating from this moment were thought to have survived. But, in 2017, Professor Yannos Lolos discovered new evidence that helps us to understand what this bay might have been like at the time. On the eve of the Battle of Salamis, the united Greek fleet was stationed in this bay with over 300 triple-decker warships. You've been investigating here out in the bay. What have you found here? We have constructed the first underwater geological map of the bay, of the harbour, of Salamis. This is the harbour of the city state of Athens, this is a fortified harbour, including a long wall with a round tower at each end. There's no doubt about the crucial role of this harbour on the eve of the sea battle of Salamis. We can imagine the Athenians, who see from the heights surrounding this bay their city in flames... It's just there behind us, isn't it? I'm trying to imagine the fear, the anger, the desperation that the people in this bay must have felt... Yes, yes. ..at that time. Because Athens was no longer. Using the new research, our scan team has managed to fix the coordinates of the archaeological remains here. Our graphic model of the harbour wall and its defensive tower shows how it extended 160 metres into the bay. And this is where the force of over 300 Greek triremes gathered to take on a Persian fleet said to be three times as strong. To help balance the odds, the general, Themistocles, managed to lure the Persians into the narrow straits beyond the bay, where their superior numbers would count for nothing. As the massive force funnelled into the narrow stretch of water, the Athenians and their allies pounced, rammed into the enemy ships, and smashed the Persian fleet apart. It was a stunning victory for the world's first democracy. But victory came at a high price for Athens. The people returned to a city in ruins. Even their sacred buildings on the Acropolis had been razed to the ground. In the decades after the Athenians defeated the Persians, they did something really quite extraordinary. Instead of rebuilding their city, they chose instead to leave it in ruins as a memorial, as they put it, to the impiety of the barbarian. And yet, while they would happily leave their city in ruins, the Athenians moved as quickly as they could to build something else entirely to protect themselves in the future. And that's what I'm trying to find here in the streets of Athens today. And I think it's somewhere around here. I've been told to take a left at the loos, and now I'm looking for some stairs downwards. And here they are. This you don't see every day in a car park. These are 2,500-year-old city walls. The Themistoclean Walls of Athens. You can still see the... ..the individual blocks neatly lined up on top of one another, and we've got here... We've got one course, a second, a third, a fourth, a fifth disappearing into the floor, and we're yet nowhere near the foundations. They must be even further down. The story is that every Athenian was told to drop whatever they were doing and come and help build the walls, and in the foundations, they put anything they could find. There's column drums in there, sculptures, gravestones, anything that would help this wall rise up as quickly as possible. Our scans and graphics show that these walls, concealed within the modern car park, were part of a series of building projects that would transform Athens. First, the Athenians enclosed their city, then, almost 10km away, they fortified the port of Piraeus. And then they linked the two with a fortified corridor that ran all the way from the ports to the centre of Athens, a system of long walls almost 150 metres apart and estimated to be 3.5 metres high. With the completion of the Long Walls connecting the port of Piraeus to these walls guarding the city, Athens effectively became an island on the mainland. No strictly land-based force could really ever hope to conquer it. And as a result, to many, Athens seemed impregnable. A bit narrow... Whoa! And into the water. Let's see if we can get through this. When the ancient Athenians eventually did decide to rebuild their city, they wanted to do it bigger and better than ever before, and so they turned to the very landscape around them, because the land around Athens is literally made of marble. Although we're obviously driv... CLUNK HE LAUGHS ...just driving on, it's like we're driving on a marble road. We're driving on Penteli Mountain and it was here that the Athenians came to quarry. The quarry face that dates from that time is still here. And archaeologist Alexandra Mari is going to show me. And what were your impressions when you first saw it? I was amazed, actually, by all these things which are here. This is it. Wow! This is the quarry. Isn't it nice? It's extraordinary. It's huge! I mean, it's massive, you can see the sheer walls they quarried off. The walls, yes, yes. Can we get any sense of how much marble was quarried out of this space? Well, approximately 400,000 tonnes of marble were produced by this quarry the Quarry of the Cave, as it is called. And you can see all the cut marks, can't you, of all the individual chisels moving, moving... First of all, they had to choose the right block, without fissures and cracks, and then they would start hammering, continuous hammering until they managed to split the block. But that's incredibly dangerous... Yes. ..and time-consuming and hard work. Very, very much, yes. Yes, yes, exactly. What they had to do was to transport it to a special road called Lithagogia, meaning conveyance of stones. And there's nothing left of that road today? Well, yes, there is, actually. There is? Just a little, a small part. This was once the start of a long route that ran from the quarry to the heart of the city over 18km away. I mean, it's still beautiful, isn't it, over 2,500 years? I mean, it's like a sledge track. Yes, exactly. It seems that they were using animal fat in order to grease the flagstones and reduce the friction. And the danger that if one block of marble got away, it would just sweep down the mountain? And a little further down the hillside is, in fact, one runaway block from the quarry above. But take a look at this view. What do you think about it? Hang on a sec, is this...? This is a piece of a column. It's a column drum. Mmhm. So perhaps somebody did take their eye off the job and was looking at the view and they missed their rope. After all. And it all went! This weighed ten tonnes. Can you imagine having to go back up to the top to all the workers who have been quarrying this piece of stone, and go, "Sorry, guys, we've got to start again"? "It just broke," yeah. A phenomenal sort of marker to an incredible process. Yes, exactly. The marble that was quarried here and transported all the way to the city became the face of Athens' new identity that of a place on the cusp of a golden age of not just art and architecture, but politics, philosophy, culture a golden age that still burns bright in our human story. Our 3D model shows how the gleaming marble from Mount Penteli was used to create brand-new monuments over the ruins of the Acropolis. The most prestigious of which were the Parthenon, started in 447 BC... ..the Propylaea, a temple to Nike... ..and of course the Erechtheion... ..all completed in one remarkable 40-year burst of creativity and confidence in the second half of the fifth century BC. Athens was now the most powerful city in Greece, and the Athenian Empire began to extend its influence across the sea. So, Costas, we have calm seas today, good seas to be out on the boat? Yes, it's very good weather. This is Cape Sounion. It's about 80km south of Athens, and it's the southernmost tip of the land of the Athenians, Attica. For the Athenians who'd been out across the Aegean on trading ventures or military expeditions, the sight of this place meant that they were finally home. But something of a mystery has grown-up around Sounion. Thanks to the Temple of Poseidon that sits on the hill, it was mostly known as a sacred site, and until recently, that's overshadowed the strategic role it played in Athens' empire. Now a team of archaeologists, including Dr Kalliopi Baika, are discovering how important it really was. There was a settlement with a very important strategic role and commercial value, and here we're standing in front of a very big, massive building, actually. This is a corner, and the other part of the corner you can see the other way. So basically I'm standing in the middle of what was once a wall going that way... Yes, a massive wall. ..out to sea. They didn't build the building half on the land and half in the sea, so something's changed? We have a relative sea-level change of two metres and a half, almost three metres, from the fifth century BC. So what you're telling me is that half of the settlement that was here at Sounion is there in the water? Yes. And we can get in and explore that? Absolutely, yes, we can. Sounion's crucial role in the defence of the Athenian Empire is now becoming clearer. Sounion is the most sophisticated small-scale naval base in the Mediterranean. Here, we have a strategic lookout post that operates in a network of naval bases. And that means, from here, a ship could reach the message to Athens that an enemy fleet is approaching in only one hour. The water is clear, but I'm having trouble finding the remains of the city. Yes, the vertical lines, the small structures from this way. And, finally, here they are. Massive sections of defensive wall from the submerged city, still recognisable after 2,500 years. And one of the berths of the ancient naval base cut into sheer rock. And fine marble blocks from what must have been impressive structures in this strategically important town. It's absolutely amazing down there, as clear as day. It must have been once upon a time stretching down from the coastline, now under the water behind me, the remains of a massive wall. As you come out from the coast, the ancient blocks, they're a decent size, but they get bigger and bigger till the ones here must have been an enormous fortification wall for the ancient town of Sounion. It feels like a world frozen in time down there. Fortified naval bases like Sounion helped Athens extend its empire across Greece, the Aegean and the coast of Asia Minor. But its supremacy didn't go unchallenged. From here on the hill above Sounion you can look out towards the Peloponnese, home to their bitterest Greek rival Sparta. In the second half of the fifth century BC, the two cities waged war on and off across this territory for almost 30 years. Athens relied mostly on its famous fleet to fight its cause... ..while the citizens took refuge behind their city walls. But in 405 BC, the Spartans finally lured Athens into a disastrous sea battle... ..and then laid siege to their weakened city. Athens was forced to surrender the following year. The golden age of the world's first democracy was coming to an end. Its ideals and achievements, however, would never be forgotten. That was partly due to the Athenians themselves, who eulogised their golden age in the centuries that followed, but it was also partly thanks to the Romans, who came to control Athens in the first century BC. And over the next two centuries Athens became a kind of theme park cum finishing school for the Roman elite. In the second century AD, the Emperor Hadrian was one of Rome's most passionate admirers of all things Greek. Hadrian didn't just repair bits of Athens, he claimed the city for himself. This is the Arch of Hadrian and there still, just above the archway, you can read a text, it says simply, "This is the city of Hadrian." Hadrian was on a mission to improve Athens and he lavished the city with gifts a library, a gymnasium, and something even more crucial to the everyday life of the people. And that's what brings me here, to the site of the modern Olympic Village. I'm going to explore a feat of Roman engineering. Which means going underground... again. Tim, how are we looking? It's good. I'm just getting the final preparations here. But you can feel the... You can feel the hot air coming out from under there. I can't even see the bottom, I've got no sense... It's about 16 metres straight down. Just absolutely straight burrowed, down through... This shaft leads down to a 2nd century AD Roman aqueduct, where TV cameras have never been allowed to film before. Oh, gosh, it's narrow now. Oh, I can hear the water. LAUGHS Here we come, into the underground aqueduct. There we are. God, I've got not even room enough for me to stand sideways. Have I got my torch? Get to start exploring. There's the water right there, this is extraordinary. Oh, I'm stuck, I am actually stuck. I'll go more on my side. I can see the passageway just opening up behind me it's just going dead on. The water is... It's cold, it's fresh, it's got that mountain feel to it. You can see it's doing its job, bringing the water from the hills around Athens right into the centre. I'm just trying to imagine the lives of the people who were actually cutting this out of the sheer rock. I mean, absolutely appalling conditions. I'm wondering whether these... I keep seeing these... They're sort of a little shelf. This was how they managed to see down here what they were doing. They had small oil lamps, like my torch, I can put it here, just giving them enough of a flickering light, by which to hack away at the solid rock in front of them. THEY LAUGH Can't actually now turn my head back. There we go. This tunnel took 15 years to dig out of solid rock, and runs for 20km. It's an astonishing feat of ancient engineering. And I've asked aqueduct expert Dr Shawna Leigh to shed some light on it. So, Shawna, how did they go about building such a project so deep underground? They would dig vertical shafts something between 33 and 35 metres apart, and dig towards each other and ideally meet each other. What happens if you don't meet the first time? So, you have to do a little curve to sort of get it together. Just like this one we've come through? Yes, exactly, right there. And we're talking about an aqueduct of over 20km in length. Right. How did they manage to get that gradient so perfect? Well, it's absolutely striking because it's all based on gravity, so if the slope is too steep, the water will move too quickly and basically tear apart the tunnel. And if it's too shallow, the water won't move. And here it is, still flowing beneath our feet... Absolutely. ..almost 2,000 years later. It's amazing, isn't it? Oh, and this section's even narrower! The aqueduct's getting lower and lower, I'm having to go actually down on my knees right into the water. Oh! But the payoff is this extraordinary vaulted ceiling. They have these unusual markings from... frankly who knows when? It's nice to see the sky again. The scans reveal the aqueduct in amazing detail. We can see several of those remarkable curves where the workmen almost missed each other. The section we scanned was just over 80 metres long, and over that distance, the water level drops less than half a metre. A gradient so well-engineered that the aqueduct was used until the middle of the 20th century. And this is just one part of a network of ancient aqueducts that runs for almost 80km beneath the city of Athens. I've seen so much of ancient Athens hidden beneath the surface of the modern city, but now I'm going to experience it in virtual reality. OK. Jump on in. Oh...can't wait to see what you've got waiting. Ah, wow! So this is the Acropolis, of course. That's the gods' view! We're, like, flying over the top of the city. So, actually, we can dive on in a little bit here and go and have a real detailed view of the Erechtheion. And this is, I mean, the best doll's house in the world. Check this out. Today you can just walk into the building. I can put myself inside it and look at it from this side. Wow. So we're back now at a scale that you'll be super familiar with, right? The world is the real scale. This is one to one, wow. And actually you are not allowed here... No. ..in the real world. We're right down looking up at the whole of the porch, aren't we? From the hole. Whoa! You've got us flying through the air. Yeah. So now we can just drift around the Erechtheion. We've just been through the door. Hang on a sec, now we're going into a wall! There's a wall, whoa, whoa! Whoa, we just went through the wall. Why not, hey? And here we are. Oh, wow. What a view. You wonder what they've been staring at for the past 2,500 years. Just step up on there and give them a hand. What, so if I try to...? Hang on a sec. Whoa! Oh, that is a freaky experience. That's worse than flying through the virtual world cos you're actually propelling yourself... And I'm right... I'm right next to them! It's like, "Yeah, you know what? "Easy peasy, no worries." Do you think you could hold that pose for two and a half millennia? Well, with a view like this. Yeah, it's not so bad. I think it definitely would have compensations. Looking out over Athens' glory of the Parthenon, it's creating this link that was so important to the Athenians between the landscape, the past, the present, the future. If there's a spot you put yourself in in Athens to understand what it means to be Athenian, this is it. The Athenians smelted silver from their mines and voted to invest it in a naval fleet. They built dry docks to preserve their warships. They surrounded their city and their harbour with extraordinary walls. And they gave their city a unique identity, using marble carved from their own quarries. This bold democracy left a legacy that has never been forgotten. It's all too easy when you come to Athens to be overwhelmed by the beauty of the buildings on the Acropolis, the Parthenon, the Erechtheion, but what's become clear to me is that the hidden and invisible spaces of the city are just as important. Those mines and aqueducts, those quarries and ship sheds, those are the spaces in which Athens itself was forged, its ideas and dreams made real, and those are ideas and dreams that still inspire us today. Next time, Istanbul. Where east meets west. I feel like I'm flying above the streets below us. A lost chariot-racing track. Revelations underground... How are we suddenly in such an enormous space? ..and Roman and Islamic engineering masterpieces. If you'd like to explore Invisible Athens in 3D yourself, The world's ancient cities still contain many surprises and treasures hidden from view for centuries. Now, with the latest scanning technology, I'm going to reveal the secrets of three of the most fascinating cities on Earth. Cairo - the gateway to Egypt's ancient wonders. Athens - the birthplace of democracy. And, in this programme... ..Istanbul - the dramatic crossroads between Asia and Europe. For over 2,500 years, the East has met the West, here, in Istanbul, the strategic mid ground fought over by some of the world's mightiest empires. Romans, Christian crusaders and Muslim Turks all battled to control this place. It was once the biggest city on Earth... OK. ..but many of its ancient treasures are invisible... Oh! ..buried deep beneath the surface of the city. I imagine rats. Be careful. Whoa! I'll be working with our 3-D scanning team to explore palaces, fortresses, and aqueducts. We'll uncover the forgotten Roman chariot track... This was the track right here? Yes. ..reveal the genius of the city's ancient engineers... Incredible. ..and explore a masterpiece of Islamic innovation. And I'll be using virtual reality to see the city in a totally new way. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Istanbul as even the locals may never have seen it before. Welcome to invisible Istanbul. Istanbul... ..the bridge between two continents. And I'm arriving on the mighty waterway that put this city on the map. I'm on the Bosphorus, one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. Behind me, to the north, is the Black Sea and in front of me is the Mediterranean. On my left is Asia and on my right, Europe. People coming and going from every point of the compass converge here. And straddling this waterway is the city of Istanbul. Istanbul's strategic position made it irresistible to the great powers of the ancient world. 2,500 years ago, it was the Greek town of Byzantium. The Romans transformed it into the city of Constantinople. Then, in 1453, it became the Islamic city of Istanbul. As Napoleon put it, "If the world were a single state, "then this city would be its capital." Istanbul's tempestuous history has created one of the most vibrant cities on the planet. There's evidence of that turmoil all over the city. Even the city's most famous places have their battle scars. The Hagia Sophia, or Church of the Holy Wisdom of Christ, was built by the Romans. For hundreds of years, it was the biggest cathedral in the world. Modern buildings often only last for decades. I'm going to find out how the Hagia Sophia is still standing after 1,500 years. The height of this dome, the sense of air and space is just extraordinary. When it was built, in the sixth century AD, this was the tallest dome in the world - 55 metres above my head. And the people of the time talked about the way that it seemed to reach for the very sky itself. This building dominated the landscape of sixth-century Constantinople and left its people in awe. Two previous versions of the Hagia Sophia were destroyed by fire. So, the Emperor Justinian made this one into a massive statement of Roman power and endurance. The dome of the Hagia Sophia has faced earthquakes, riots sieges and conquest. Our scanning team, led by architect Matt Shore, is trying to find out how it survived. Matt, good to see you. Michael. How are you doing? This is Tom. Hi. Tom. Nice to see you. Great to see the scanner is already in action. Yep, we've been going all morning. So, are we going to be able to get an answer to the question, you know, that always strikes me here, which is - how is this building still standing? Yeah, I mean, that's the plan. So, the scanner is firing away over a million points a second. We're going to create a model of this entire space that has over a billion points in it. Wow! So, we're going to be able to visualise this whole thing, this enormous, enormous structure, and get... Maybe, unravel the mysteries? That's the plan, that's... Well, we've been talking big. But if I can steal you away from Tom for a second if he's in charge... He looks like he's got it under control. I've got something small to show you which is my favourite thing in this entire place. OK. Let's go. After 1,500 years, the history of Justinian's cathedral has become entangled with legend. Justinian spared no expense on this building, right? He had stuff brought in from Africa, from Asia and, of course, across the Mediterranean, and these are his doors. These are the Emperor's doors, and the story goes that they're actually made from bits of Noah's Ark. OK. Yeah, but, I mean, what he wanted to be was the new Solomon... Yeah. ..and builder of the first temple of Jerusalem, and, supposedly, the story goes that when he walked into this place, when it was finished, he said, you know, "I have outdone thee, Solomon." But this is what I came to show you. This is the important bit. This hole? This hole, right? OK. And the story goes... These are the Emperor's doors. This is where the guards stood. OK. And these holes in the ground are... Years of footsteps. Years and years. Hours and hours of the guys standing here on guard. So, if you want to be kind of in the shoes of the people from the past, right? You can't get much better than a place like this. It kind of reminds me of the pacing round the scanner that we do. Our little circles, around and around. MICHAEL LAUGHS On that note, I probably should let you get back to it, right? I probably should. I'm going to head off this way. Thank you for sharing. Good to see you. Good luck. In the 15th century, the Hagia Sophia was converted into a mosque and, later, these minarets were added. BIRDS SQUAWK It was a church for just over 900 years, and it was a mosque for just under 500, and now, it's been a museum for just over 80. Its strategic position between Europe and Asia has placed it at the centre of a religious and political tug-of-war that continues to this day. The Hagia Sophia embodies the city's turbulent history. Istanbul will always be pulled between East and West, it will always have to make a choice as a result of geopolitics and internal change. To get evidence of how history has changed the city, Matt and his team are going to create a 3-D map of the heart of Istanbul. We're going to employ a process called photogrammetry. Taking thousands and thousands of individual photographs... ...and we pump all of those images in and use very clever algorithms. Then, we're able to compute a really, really accurate 3-D model of Istanbul. The model will show us a city built, destroyed and transformed over the last two millennia. And by scanning the Hagia Sophia inside and out, we'll discover how it, too, has survived against the odds. And the first scans are coming in now. Matt, how are you doing? How are you doing, Michael? Good to see you. Can't wait to see Istanbul in all her glory. There she is! And there we go. Wow! So, this is our photogrammetry model. Wow! Unbelievable. And at the very centre of all of that, as well - Hagia Sophia. And there it is. And the really interesting stuff comes when we get ourselves in... MICHAEL LAUGHS We just went inside the building! Now that's something... I mean, you can't do that in real life, can you? You can't fly through a wall whenever you fancy it. Just incredible. But what do you think the scans have been able to reveal that we couldn't possibly have known when we were there? Well, I mean, even inside the scans, your eye is always drawn up to the dome here. And if we start to navigate our way up there, actually, immediately, we start to see some slightly strange inconsistencies. So, the dome is not circular any more. You get these lumps and bumps in, and what that is, we're seeing the effects of earthquakes over the years. But, I mean, it looks as clear as day on that scan, that there's a big bump area at the top and at the bottom, but that wasn't visible to us at all in... hen we were there in reality. No, I think, it's not filling in any of the gaps that you do with your eye and, actually, this gets more revealing when we start to take ourselves outside, and just skim the building here. So, what we're left with, here, is just the inner skin of the dome and check out some of these lumps and bumps. Yeah, and they're not just flaws, as well, I mean, there's an amazing amount of ingenuity and solution that's on display here, as well. So, you're faced with these incredible situations, earthquakes trying to pull this building apart. So, 26 years after it was first constructed, the dome collapsed. One of the first techniques that was used when they rebuilt this dome was the series of ribs that you can see here, taking the weight down to this circular beam. And then these crucial, triangular structural pieces. These are called pendentives. And these transfer the weight from the circle at the bottom of the dome to four points, and they turn this structure from a spherical structure into a square structure. So, they take that load in four positions down to the ground here. And when you're there, in the building, you don't think about any of that, cos your eye is completely taken to the beautiful angels. It feels like the angels are literally holding up...heaven, aren't they? They're holding up the roof. Yeah. And if I actually just pull us back outside the building here, I can actually slice this building up. So, we have our dome here. We also have these two big half domes on the side here, and what that does is expand that space out. So, when you walk inside, you really feel this enormous volume. But even these clever structural systems weren't quite enough. So, over the years, a series of buttresses have been added to every side. And they're holding it all together, right? Yeah. They're stopping things from splaying out. Our scans can also give us a better idea of what the building looked like before the minarets were added in the 15th and 16th centuries. I mean, that makes this scanning such a fantastic tool, doesn't it, for historians, or architects, or engineers? It's giving you the life story of this building, with all the lumps and bumps and wrinkles that that brings. The Roman city of Constantinople was named after its founding emperor, Constantine, and the Hagia Sophia was its spiritual heart. The Emperor's seat of earthly power was built right next to the cathedral. The Great Palace - a vast, luxury complex in the heart of the city. This was home to Rome's Byzantine emperors for nearly 700 years. Today, people drive past the old palace walls without a second thought. But they were once one of Constantinople's glories. This, well, rather romantic ruin is the Palace of Boukoleon and it was part of the great complex of palaces, here, in Istanbul. And when it was built in the fifth century, the sea came right up here. So, this was the summer residence, the seaside annexe, if you will, of the imperial family. And when it was built, they said that it was designed to evoke the admiration, both of strangers and of their own subjects, and... I can buy that. This place had 500 rooms, all with gold mosaics. I'd be pretty gobsmacked. And yet, today... Well... ..that is the best bit that's left. I've been told I can find a way into the Boukoleon Palace through here. This feels like something entirely sort of dystopian. There's a train line over here... TRAIN HORN HOOTS ..I'm in somebody's garden... ..and here... ..we're back in the palace! This is... It's like nature has completely taken over this world. But we have to imagine what this place would have been like in its glory. This, a grand, echoing state room with marble mosaics - the treasures and statues beyond measure. And gorgeous, huge windows looking out to sea. It must've been quite a sight to behold. Our graphic gives us an idea of the grandeur of this magnificent building - just one part of the Great Palace complex. Everywhere you go in this part of Istanbul, you stumble upon the remains of the Great Palace. THEY CHAT Ferudun Ozgumus, professor of art history at Istanbul University, is taking me to see one of the most recent discoveries. But there are some examples of some of the old... I want to show you under this building in the carpet shop. In the carpet shop? In the carpet shop, yes. OK. There was an old building stood here once... Uh-huh. ..and when they demolished the old building in 2002, they unearthed, I don't know, by coincidence, one of the major discoveries of our work in Istanbul. Oh, OK. Down the basement. OK. We've been through the carpet shop... Yes. ..and now... And now a travel agency. Now a travel agency! OK! And now for the kitchen section. The kitchen, OK. Right. And now from the kitchen section, we're going deeper. OK. It feels like a weirdly, domesticated journey to the centre of the Earth right now. Exactly. But I'm going to show you something very interesting. Ooh! Going down, deeper and deeper, and I want to show you... What's this? That's a very interesting mosaic floor. Came to light 2002. It was a part of a church, and the church itself was a part of the Great Palace of Constantine the Great. Our 3-D map shows the position of today's carpet shop inside the walls of the Great Palace. This must have been an exquisite church. This is from the late seventh century - mosaic floor... And it's beautiful. What stunning condition! And not only this one, and we have something special that all Eastern Orthodox Churches have, which is deeper... Deeper? We can go down deeper? Yes, exactly. I mean, literally, we're going down through the layers of the past here, aren't we? Lead on! DOOR RUMBLES So, we're going down. Deeper. Oh, my lord! Oh! So, we're underneath the seventh-century Byzantine church floor? Yes. Wow, what a space! And what I want to show you, particularly is... So, this is what we've come all this way for? Yes. Uh! So, this is a, what, a freshwater spring? And that's Byzantine, and Byzantine springs are very rare in Istanbul. And that water looks so clear! And what's this? We've got an image here... How extraordinary. I mean, this makes this a very valuable... Our scan shows nearly nine metres of layered history. From the ancient spring, up through the Great Palace, to the carpet shop in the modern city. MAN SPEAKS IN TURKISH Can I have one? Thank you. VOICEOVER: The Emperor Constantine moved the capital of the Roman Empire here in the fourth century... Yes! ..and he wanted to make a city to outshine Rome. He went on a building spree - churches, palaces, public baths and a library. And within a century the population soared... ..from 20,000 to 200,000. The Romans were brilliant at creating public places where the whole city could come together, everyone from the Emperor downwards. Think...the Colosseum in Rome. And here, in Constantinople, that place was the Hippodrome, the chariot racing track. And I've come to meet someone who knows this place inside out. Kerim? Hi, Michael. KERIM SPEAKS IN TURKISH Shall we explore? I can't wait to find out more about this. It's my pleasure. Only these walls remain but there's enough to see how impressive the Hippodrome must have been. Where are we now? We are now in front of the monumental facade of the Hippodrome's curved end, called Sphendone. Ah. Would there have been entrances this end? Yeah. Here, look. You can here see the... the vaulted archways forming the entrances and exits. Now walled up. The Hippodrome once dominated ancient Constantinople. This was the social centre of the city... ...holding twice as many spectators as Rome's Colosseum... ...and even more than today's Wembley Stadium. But little remains of the racetrack. Can we get a sense of what this place would have been like on race day? Where would the spectators have been sitting? Where would the chariots have been racing? So, we can estimate that... ..the road running around today's square was almost perfectly following the line of chariot racing track. This was the track right here? Yes. So, we have to imagine the chariots coming right at us now at full pelt! Let's move out of the way, quickly. It's fantastic... But that sense of, what, up to 100,000 people, something like that, chanting, screaming... Yes, you're right. ..kind of all cheering on their teams. Yes. Wow. What a place! And the Emperor watching over it all, huh? Yeah, he was. And I've got something else to show you in the underground. So, Kerim, where are we going? Yeah, you will see the substructure of the Hippodrome, Michael. We're going in here? Yes. I guess, this is a place the public don't get very often, right? No. Come. Follow me. OK. Now I see why you told us to bring torches. Yeah. Wow. What a space! What do you think? Amazing. Where are we? This is the substructure of the seating. So, underneath all those spectators cheering away? Yes, exactly. And there's tunnels - you can go this way. There's tunnels that way. My God, it's a rabbit warren down here. Yeah, you'd better follow me. OK. I'll definitely follow you. I guess we have to imagine people were getting to their seats, all the services.... Yes. What else happened down here, do you think? There's also a story about this concealed space used as a prison or for...for the execution. Wow. For instance, we know from the sources, Justinian II was tortured by his rebellious subjects in the seventh century. It happened probably here. To repay his despotic rule, they sliced off his nose and cut out his tongue. And after banishing for ten years, he returned. He returned? Having to hide behind a solid golden mask replacing his nose, he continued ruling over the population until his own army turned on him. This time, they cut off his head to make sure that he wouldn't come back. Amazing. And what's through here? My God, you can go... There's tunnels, there's ways here, here... There's a doorway here, Kerim? What's...? Yeah. See it yourself. Through here. Go on, go ahead. I'll go ahead, shall I? OK. Wow! OK. Er...Kerim? I think we're going to need a lot more gear. HE GRUNTS Well, don't I feel good? To be honest, I feel like a trussed-up chicken but... I think I'm ready. Kerim? OK, let's go. OK, let's do this. Kerim is going to show me how the Hippodrome was cleverly adapted to help the city survive. I clip on... SPLASHING Is it cold? Oh! OK. Be careful. OK. Yes, the steps are slippy. It feels like there's quite a few rocks under our feet but... TAPPING Wow, this place is huge! Yes. It's extraordinary. But how are we suddenly in such an enormous space? Yeah, because this vaulted chamber was converted into a cistern. Probably in the sixth century. So, they completely just repurposed this entire... Yes, exactly. ..area? Wow. The city is surrounded by the sea, but it has very few sources of fresh water. Saving every drop was essential. So, the Romans transformed the Hippodrome's passageways into this massive reservoir. This vaulted space alone could hold ten million litres to save the city in times of siege or drought. And all thanks to the Roman invention of waterproof cement. This is the hydraulic plaster, the waterproof plaster. It's good plaster! It's still here. Yeah. Amazing. How full do you think this place could have been of water when it was in use? So, the levels of the hydraulic plaster here might indicate the maximum storage level for us. So, I mean, this place could have been absolutely full of water right to the top? It is possible, yes, and probably connected with the water supply lines of the city. This was one of the large cisterns of Constantinople. This was one of the largest? Yeah. Actually we have...more than 200 cisterns identified. These water tanks came in all shapes and sizes. Tiny ones for single families, and massive ones like this for whole neighbourhoods. And so where would the water here have been going? This area was the Great Palace of Constantinople. So, this was used by the Great Palace. We can keep going till that wall, till it blocks our way. So, we cannot continue any further. But the cistern continues that way. Oh, I see. So the wall goes halfway up, but actually this chamber continues around on the... It continues, yes. ..on the other side. So, Kerim, what's this channel here going curving off to the right? This might indicate the connection between an Ottoman fountain built in front of the facade. So, it was built in the 16th century. Then we can say that the cistern stayed in use at least for 1,000 years after the sixth century. So, it's converted in... The Hippodrome's been here since, well, since the first centuries AD in different forms, converted into a cistern in the sixth century... Yes. ..and still being used as a cistern at least in the 16th century? Exactly. Yes. A thousand years here of water just kind of around us. So, it's also proves the continuous needs of stored water in the city. Thank you. Thank you for showing it to me. You're very welcome, Michael. Let's go back. As the scan team goes to work inside the Hippodrome, Tom also finds it hard going. We're obviously carrying some extremely expensive equipment. The last thing we wanted to do was fall into that stagnant water that's clearly stood there for years. You do kind of worry about what wildlife could be under your feet. Rats. Dead birds. Guano all over everything. Our scans show how a structure built for entertainment was transformed into a life-saving reservoir. Now it's largely forgotten... ..except by those who know invisible Istanbul. With a rapidly growing population, improvised water storage wasn't enough. Constantinople used Roman engineering genius on an even grander scale. There's no better place from which to witness the miracle of Roman hydraulic engineering than right here, having a cup of tea - because I am surrounded by an aqueduct. This is the Valens Aqueduct, the major route bringing fresh drinking water into the city. The Romans needed their aqueducts to be as straight and as efficient as possible and that meant conquering the very landscape. Here we're between two hills, and the Roman solution is to build a bridge between them. So, this thing goes 30 metres up into the air and over a kilometre across from one hill to the other. And as a result, even the modern metropolis of Istanbul has to bend around it. Hi, Jim. How are you doing? The man to tell us about it is Professor James Crow from Edinburgh University. Farther than it looks from down the bottom, actually! Yes. It's wonderful when you get up here, don't worry. Jim's been mapping the ancient city's water supply system for decades. Thank you very much! Oh, what a view already! And the sun! Welcome to... I might leave my jacket here. This is...fabulous. What a place! Yep. Jim, I feel like I'm flying above the streets below us. But this is the aqueduct. Where was the water going? Well, within this, there are big channels. They are nearly as tall as you, as wide as that, and they carry the water from huge distances, to the west of the city, into the city to fill its cisterns and its fountains. So, Jim, how have you discovered this network? Well, before we started, we knew there was this very long system outside of the city but it was over 20 years of fieldwork, looking at old maps, a whole range of things, and then talking to lots of people in villages, having lots of cups of tea, finding out where these structures are and the channels are, because it's a deeply forested area - it's like working in a jungle almost. And suddenly these great bridges will appear out in deep-sided valleys covered in trees. I've got an image of Indiana Jones already! Well, I don't know. It was quite fun to do. But at the same time, we were then able to map the system, project the whole length and assess how long this system extends into the countryside and away from the city. And are we thinking about a water system here as sophisticated as that of Rome? Certainly as sophisticated. And, in some ways, it surpassed Rome in terms of the engineering skills that were needed. And engineers, modern engineers, when we talk to them about it, are just astonished. They cannot understand how these guys were capable of it. Our scans help show how the water flowed through two great channels inside the aqueduct bridge. The water went into 209 cisterns across the city. Some improvised, like the one in the Hippodrome, some purpose-built and some as big as a football pitch. They were fed by two aqueducts coming from forest springs up to 200 kilometres away. With over 580 kilometres of channels, this was the longest and most sophisticated water system of the Roman world. It helped transform Constantinople into one of the richest cities in the world. But such a wealthy and strategically important city was vulnerable to attack. The Romans surrounded the city with walls that were said to be impenetrable. Attila the Hun, Arabs, Bulgars, Russians all met these walls in their attempts to lay siege to the city of Constantinople. Enemies attacking by land faced a moat, a wall, a no-man's-land and then a second wall - 15 feet thick and 40 feet high. The land walls alone stretch nearly four miles across the peninsula, with nine massive gates and 96 towers like these. They completed a ring of stone from the harbour inlet, known as the Golden Horn, to the sea. No-one managed to break through these walls for centuries. In fact, their most dangerous opponent over the centuries were the earthquakes that this area is prone to. Earthquakes damaged these walls time and again, and time and again the citizens came back to rebuild them bigger, better and stronger than ever before. But nothing lasts for ever. So far, our scans have recorded ruins that tell the story of the rise of Constantinople. The ruins of the once-glorious Palace of Boukoleon also record its decline. This was once a chapel and it's now, according to the signs on the walls, the home of Hasan, who's decorated it. Well... ..it's kind of like my daughter would decorate it, really. It's a home...of sorts. This palace was destroyed when Christians turned on one another. There'd been religious disputes between the Roman Catholic world and the Byzantine Empire for hundreds of years. And in the end, Western crusaders found Constantinople's riches just too much of a temptation. This palace was damaged and rebuilt many times in its history. But its final death knell was in 1204 when Western, European crusaders led by the city of Venice came here and destroyed the city and took this beautiful place down with them. The Western invaders stayed in Constantinople for over 50 years. They desecrated Eastern Orthodox churches, destroyed the ancient library and looted the Great Palace complex, leaving them in ruins. The clash between the Eastern and Western wings of Christianity tore Constantinople apart. By the 15th century, Constantinople's population was no more than 70,000 people. Its power, its glory days were behind it. It was a shell. And it would only get worse. By 1452, the city of Constantinople was all that was left of the Eastern Roman Empire. It was a tiny Christian island surrounded by the Muslim Turks' Ottoman Empire. The Turks had the city at their mercy. Constantinople had to find ways to survive alone. Packed with cisterns and with good agricultural land within the walls, the citizens of Constantinople were well prepared for any siege, and it's a tradition that still continues today with the gardens here around me that are using the old moat and even the space in between the city walls to cultivate their fruit and veg. But while the people of Constantinople grew their own food and rationed their precious water, the Ottoman Empire was tightening its grip. With the city surrounded, supplies could only enter by ship. The Turkish leader Sultan Mehmet built this fortress to stop them. It guarded the narrowest point on the Bosphorus, less than 800 metres from his fort on the Asian side. Today, this place is known as Rumelihisari, which means "The fortress of the Romans", because we're on the European side, and when Mehmet came and built this fortress, this was Roman land. But its original name is Bogazkesen. Now, that means "The cutter of the Bogaz" - the Bosphorus, the river. But, in Turkish, the same word means "throat". This place was intended to cut the throat - of the Bosphorus and of the people of the city of Constantinople. The main tower of Rumelihisari fortress was a strategic command post for Mehmet's whole operation. Its secrets are locked away, but local historian Ali Zirek is taking us to see them. Amazing. Do you have the key? Yes. I'm really curious to find out what this tower was used for and Ali's taking me up to the top to find out. What a room! What a space, Ali! What went on here? Do we know? So we're in a place where Mehmet may have conceived his final plans for taking Constantinople? There's the heavy smell and weight of history in this room. It's extraordinary. Our scans allow us to really get under the skin of Mehmet's HQ. As we rise through the tower's seven storeys, a war machine of ruthless efficiency is revealed. With walls up to seven metres thick that protect Mehmet's council chamber. Crenellated lookout positions. Arrow slits and firing positions. Toilets. Grain storage. Living quarters for up to 400 soldiers. Armouries bristling with their weapons. A chute to drop boiling oil onto an invader at the front door. And an unrivalled view to guard the narrowest part of the Bosphorus. The tower also holds an ancient remnant of Constantinople's defence. What is this? Was this...? Was this the chain across the...? For the Golden Horn? Yes. The Golden Horn chain? Wow! My God, it's still so solid. That's incredibly heavy. No wonder it worked so well for so long. This iron chain is the stuff of legend. For centuries, the chain was stretched across the inlet known as the Golden Horn in times of danger. Now, it stopped Mehmet's ships from reaching the heart of the city. But...Mehmet had a genius solution. He ordered logs greased in olive oil to be laid across the landscape in a road that would allow his ships to be dragged across into the estuary, thus getting around the great chain. And on 22nd April, 1453, Mehmet's fleet made its way across to take up position to besiege the city of Constantinople. The Byzantine Christian forces were down to around 5,000 against an Ottoman army of 200,000. The women, children, old and sick took refuge behind the great doors of the Hagia Sophia. For 53 days, Mehmet bombarded the city with some of the most advanced artillery in the world. On the 29th of May, 1453, The legendary walls of Constantinople were finally breached. The invading army closed in on the Hagia Sophia. They smashed down the doors. The cowering Christians were raped, slaughtered and enslaved. SCREAMING AND SHOUTING Mehmet himself lamented the devastation. "What a city we have given over to plunder and destruction." The final metamorphosis of the Roman Empire - the Byzantine world - died - less than 50 years before Columbus discovered America. And, for the city of Constantinople, a whole new chapter in its history. No longer Constantinople, it was now known as Istanbul - an Islamic city, capital of Mehmet's Ottoman Empire. The East now held sway. The best place to see how the city changed is back at the Hagia Sophia. The cathedral became a mosque. Over time, minarets were added on each corner. And these enormous panels were erected to spell out the name of Allah, the Prophet Muhammad and his grandsons. There were more subtle changes, too - these mosaic crosses were concealed by Islamic decoration. But this was by far a more important change. This was the mihrab, and it sits off-centre to the apse behind it for a very good reason, because it points in the direction of Mecca, and thus gives the direction in which the Muslim faithful should pray. Now an integral part of the Muslim world, the whole city was reborn. Sultan Mehmet is still known as Fatih - the Conqueror - but he was also a builder. Mehmet rebuilt the city walls, repaired its water supply and kick-started the city's economy by establishing this place, the Grand Bazaar. Mmm. OK, it's not too bad. New people and new cultures poured into the city. Too strong for you? HE LAUGHS Istanbul was now the capital of the Ottoman Empire. ..turns into that. But I'm going to have a look around, and I'll come back. Thank you very much. My favourite place in the Grand Bazaar? The barbers. People often ask, "What was the impact of Mehmet's victory on the city of Constantinople?" And historians call it, "The worst destruction in the history of mankind." But, at the same time, this was the beginning of a new chapter for Constantinople, a chapter in which the city was going to be bigger and better than ever before. Istanbul was transformed into the bustling, energetic place it is today, full of Asian and European influences and tastes. Now this is balik ekmek. It's a fried fish sandwich, and it's the thing to eat down here at Eminonu, near Galata Bridge. And, for my money, there's no better place in Istanbul than here to feel the swirling mix of cultures that defines this city, that jostles strongly, sometimes as roughly as the waters that run through the heart of the city. As they developed the city further, the Ottoman Turks drew on the learning of both East and West. Our 3-D map shows us one of the greatest Ottoman design innovations - a new mosque to outdo the Hagia Sophia. The Suleymaniye Mosque. Built for Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in 1557, it remains an island of peace to this day. People come to mosques obviously to pray, but... ..it's also about getting away from the hustle and bustle of the world. And there's something also I absolutely love about this kind of place. It brings together not just people going in to pray, but the whole community. Kids are running around, playing with their families, friends are catching up to have a walk and talk. This is a place to get a little respite and energy for the soul. The genius of the Suleymaniye Mosque is found in its grand design and in its smallest detail. Much is invisible, but not to my guide, architectural historian Olcay Aydemir. Oh, what a door! What an amazing... Oh! Olcay, this is incredible. What a space! I-I feel that. Yes, yes. I feel that you want to move towards the centre of the space, don't you? It's extraordinary. The sense of... ..of-of...just volume and-and, er...light in here is just incredible. And, Olcay, I've noticed that all of the lighting in here is very low compared to the ceiling. So, why? Is there a reason for that? So, it's designed to make us again feel more comfortable here. And I keep seeing shells. Yes. Ostrich eggshells? Are they just a decoration? Ostrich shells drive away spiders? Yes, yes. Brilliant! Now that is a tip for us all at home, right? Everyone needs an ostrich shell in their house. And it's all electric now... Yes. ..but when the mosque was built, this would have been candles? So we have to imagine, what, thousands of glittering lights, keeping this place alight. And the other thing I was thinking - if there were candles and oil lamps, there must've been lots of soot produced, and the ceiling must have been black with soot. And yet the walls and ceiling are pristine. It takes our scans to reveal the mosque's ingenious solution - a ventilation system hidden in the walls. The soot from the lamps was drawn up, through concealed funnels, into a secret room, where it stuck to the walls, and was made into ink for sacred manuscripts. Today, only graffiti remains. Another design secret lies under our feet. Ah, strong. Wow! What are these tunnels? Channels. These tunnels keep the building well aired today, but they originally brought drinking water to the workers building the mosque. Ingenuity is everywhere. Here decoration doubles as sound baffling, so that everyone can hear the sermon clearly. The Ottomans matched the grandeur of the Hagia Sophia, and took its design and technology to a whole new level. Sultan Suleiman had great ambitions for the people of Istanbul. He created a complex around the mosque to house a hospital, six schools, Turkish baths, a travellers' inn, a bakery, and a medical college. His goal was to make the mosque the centre of the city's flourishing society. An important part of the mosque complex is the imaret, or public kitchen. It fed over 1,000 of the city's poor every day, through this tiny hole in the wall. Brilliant. What a brilliant system. So, it's a blind transfer - I don't see them, they don't see me. Everyone is equal. And can I pick it up? How ingenious. This was a Sultan's mosque meant for everyone. Suleiman's kitchen was designed to feed Muslims, Christians and Jews alike. Today, it's a commercial restaurant. I've seen so many aspects of ancient Istanbul hidden beneath the surface of the city. Now, I'm going to experience it through virtual reality. It's all green. It is all green, yeah. I recognise these. So, this is the one-way ticket to Istanbul, huh? This is your helicopter. In you go. Wow! Hello, Istanbul! Here we go. So this is the view you were getting when you were up in the helicopter? Exactly. So if we start, the Hippodrome... Ah, the back end here, isn't it? And there's where we went into the cistern. There's the staircase. And, wow, there we are with all that mucky, dirty, rat-filled water. And then... Then we stride across and... And then... Oh, I recognise down here. This is... There she is. There she is. Hagia Sophia. And you can see the clear differences between the minarets, all constructed at different times, and then... ..I can hold the dome of Hagia Sophia in my hands. MICHAEL LAUGHS In we come in. This is a perspective that you'll probably be a little more familiar with, actually. I am. And one of the wonderful things we can do here, of course, is start to rise up. So... What? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! We're flying through the air! The detail of the roof - it's beautiful. Oh, my Lord. Here comes the roof. Oh, whoa. OK. Slow, slow down. You'll be fine. We're getting really... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So here we are. And there... Oh, my God. We're on the top of the dome. You are standing on the millimetre-thick skin of the top. You can just walk... Yeah. I-I feel like I want to walk really gingerly... Yeah, yeah. Exactly. ..just in case I fall back through. And there may be some sort of edge anywhere. And there... God, you can see the lumps and the bumps right there. There's a massive lump. Yeah. What? Oh, there we go! You've sent me flying through the air again... The Hagia Sophia is like this whole city - it's been bashed about, but it's always found a way to survive. Our journey back down to ground level. This is extraordinary. Hello. Istanbul has endured by adapting buildings like the Hippodrome to stay alive through droughts and war... ...and kept fresh water flowing to everyone through its elegant aqueducts. This is a city built upon layer after layer of history and culture. And the people of Istanbul have fought armies and earthquakes to preserve their home, against all the odds. Istanbul is a city that's been conquered, destroyed and rebuilt by both East and West. And, as a result, in both its past and its present, it's a uniquely cosmopolitan melting pot of cultures. My hope for the future is that, whatever grand shifts in power between East and West there may be, Istanbul is allowed to keep its unique personality.
