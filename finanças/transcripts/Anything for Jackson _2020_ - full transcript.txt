Now, if I mention something, do you promise to be civil about it? When you say things like that, I notice I grip the handle of the pan just a little tighter. It's not that I don't appreciate everything that you do for me, and the family too. Out with it. The hem is a bit short on one side. You're blind. Are you keeping an eye on the time? I'm paying attention. But look. Look here. They were the same when I did them. Yeah, but that's all well and good, but I'll be at the office and I'll be looking like I'm some kind of rapper guy. I highly doubt that anybody is ever going to mistake you for a rapper guy. What time is it? Henry, she's there. Come on, Henry. She's early. Be careful. Watch your steps. Shh. Quiet. Watch the baby. I can't. I can't get... Get her off of me. Got it. Come on! No, no, no! Shh. Keep quiet. Shh. Shh. Shh. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. "Aloha" means "hello" and "goodbye." She's up. Hmm? Oh. Hello. My name is Audrey. And this is my husband... Oh. Well, he'll be along. The stairs just take a few extra seconds. Mmm, mmm! There. Uh, as I was saying, my name is Audrey, and this is my husband Henry. First and foremost, Shannon, we would like to apologize for scaring you this morning, but after much deliberation, we feel this would be the best way for you to go missing. By now, you've recognized my husband Henry, or Dr. Walsh as you would better know him. Hello, Miss Shannon. Dr. Walsh will continue your care from our home. You should know that we mean you or your unborn child no harm. While we apologize for what we must do, please make no mistake. We must do it, and we will not waver no matter how much you beg. So, please do not try, as we all have feelings. Do you understand? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Do you know that we don't want to hurt you or your baby? Can you nod? I guess that's out of the way, then. Maybe we should get the tests over with. Now? Give me a minute. Okay. I'm ready. Shh. Shh, shh, shh. Help! Please, someone! Please! Nothing. Help! Someone, please! Now, nothing or nothing at all? We're good. Please! Shh. No one can hear you. We've soundproofed the room. Shh. Now, don't make this any more unpleasant than it already is. We want you to be comfortable here. For you, and for the sake of the baby. You know, I don't want to have to gag you again, but I will. Do you understand? Why are you doing this? We need to bring our grandson back, and this is the only way. I can't eat it in the car. Ta-da. Him? What do you see? Finished. You see him? Oh! He knows. He knows you're here to save him. I don't know what you're saying. Jackson, dear. He's dead. Let's make him a little bit higher. Oh, Jesus. Oh, no. We don't use that name in this house. All right. You rest, and I'll bring you some lunch in a little while. Jackie loves music. See? Someone, please! Please help me. Have you seen my keys? I thought they were in my pocket. They're not in my coat. What? He showed himself to her. No. Mm-hmm. That's good, right? Yeah. The, um... ...appearing. Appearing to the host is a good thing, right? Mm-hmm. He's coming back to us. You know, I think I'm going to stay at home today. I'll call and I'll reschedule my app... No. No. Keep up appearances. No changes in our routine. You're right. I always am. Hmm. Have a great day. Well, there's something I didn't think I'd see in this lifetime. What? You. You're still here. I shovel your snow. Oh. Ray, right? - Rory. - Rory. If you give me two minutes, I'll clear you a path here right quick. Uh, Mrs. Walsh is pretty sick. Everything's all right, I hope? Oh, yeah, yeah. She's just come down with something, which is why I'm a little late today. So, I think we should let her rest this morning. Of course. Now, if you want, I can get my shovel. Whisper quiet. She'll never even know I was here. Thank you, but I think we should let her rest. Okay, okay. I'll come back in a couple of days when she's feeling better. Now, if you could just move your truck so I could get out, I'm a tad late for work. Ah. Look at me, screwing with your day. You wish Mrs. Walsh a speedy recovery, and you drop me a line anytime you're ready. I'll fix you up. Thank you. You have a good day, now. You, too. Hello. Time for our morning vitamins. Oh, we can't have Mommy missing out, now, can we? Oop. There. Okay. There you go. No, don't worry. They're just vitamins. You see? There. All right. I get it. It's been a big morning. I will back off. Hey. Don't worry. Don't worry. Oh, oh. You brought your own pills. Are these pre-natals? Gosh. I can't read that. Don't get old. I need to get my glasses. I will be right back. Okey-dokey? Yes. No. No! - Give me the phone. - No. No extra stress, now. Come on. Thank you. There you go. Let's see. 5-0-2-9. Stop it. No, no. It's all right. It's all just part of it. Give me my fucking phone! Oh, no. Swearing is bad for our baby. There we go. Oh, I'm sorry to paint you as a woman who would do this sort of thing, but it's just a little extra insurance at our end. No. You don't have to do this. You don't have to do this! Please. All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't do two things at once. Shh. Shh. All right. Okay. Um, let me see. Um... All right. That's good. Would you say "Taking a me day"? Henry and I went back and forth on that. I said, "Mommy needs some alone time," but you know, sometimes you just have to let them win. Well, aren't you popular. Oh. "DTF"? What in world does that mean? DT... Down to... Oh, my goodness. Well, no wonder he didn't spell it out. You know, if you can't even say it, you shouldn't be doing it. That's a good rule of thumb, I think. Okay. Um, "Meet me at Fairy Lake, 2:00." Send. All right. There we go. There. Hi, dear. Yeah. I just wanted to let you know that the plan worked. I made the call and got the prize. Wonderful. You're a full-blown techie now. Have a good day, my love. Bye-bye. Believe me when I say we have thought of everything. No one has more time than a grieving family. No one. Dr. Walsh, the hospital called. They're just asking if you can do a review for them. Yes, of course. Um, good. Could you make sure you forward that, please? Already sent. Dr. Walsh. - Colin. - Hi. To what do we owe the pleasure? First off, I know what you're going to say. Yeah. It is entirely possible that I don't have HPV. I'm sorry for my rudeness. I'm really stressed out right now, okay? All righty. And if I could go ahead of you guys, that would be really appreciated. Let's go into the back room now... You have Ms. Becker right now. No, no. She's not until Friday morning. No. She rescheduled. She had a couple of questions for you. No, no. He's got to help me now. Wait, wait. Uh, no. She said... - Help me! - Send an e-mail. No, no. I still don't see anything. Did she e-mail you directly, or... No. That's right. I saw her this morning. She was out for a walk... I could be done by now. I could be done! And she said that she couldn't make it today. Okay. Well, Dr. Walsh, she's 37 weeks. So, is she coming in later today? Because the hospital keeps asking. I have no idea. Could you just help me here, please? Dr. Walsh, I swear I have it. Yes. Let's go on at the back. Thank you. Uh... I'm so sorry. Here it is. What am I looking at? I found it here this morning. Okay. Dead, right? Well, I'm not going to touch it, but yes, it looks dead. Yeah. What are you doing? You can't be carrying that around. It's a thousand years old. I know. Just hold it here. Let me open it. Oh. There. Hold that. All right. Just watch. You ready? All right. Ut aosoth meum sanguinem, dedi sanguinem commutant, ut suus reddet animam pro animam pulmonis apud. How did you do that? I found it in the book. I needed to test it to see if it was real. I wasn't sure I believed it. We can't be bringing dead things to life. Well, I can. I've been doing it all morning. All morning? Henry, yes. Do you know what this means? It works. The book is real. We can do this. We're getting him back, my love. Henry? Henry? You seem nervous. Maybe it's because we have a pregnant woman locked up in our house. We have to keep up appearances. Got it. Hey there, Ian. Henry, Audrey. Oh. Thank you so much for the book, Ian. It was a fascinating read. I'm glad you liked it. You can still keep it if you want. No, no. I read it, dear. I know. Let's not be late, hmm? Okay. Uh, Henry? Henry? Remember the Beur book you were looking for? Oh, yes. Uh, that was just curiosity. Yeah. Most subs I'm in don't think it exists. Well, I appreciate you looking. Well, I did have a lead. I had a lead, but the guy said he sold it. And to be honest with you, I think he's full of dog shit. You asked him about it? That was before I found it. We were desperate. What if he tells somebody? What if it gets out? Well, it won't get out, so stop talking about it. I have to eat, you know? I mean, everyone has to eat. We're human. Looks like we're all here. I trust everyone had a good week? - Yep. - Had a horrible week. My boyfriend graciously made snacks for everyone, but if you don't mind, I'd like to wait until after to enjoy them. Excellent. Let us begin. Glory be to Satan, the Father of the Earth, and to Lucifer, our guiding light. As it was in the void of the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, Satan's kingdom without end. And so it is done. Hail Satan. Hail Satan. Hail Satan. Hail Satan. Well, Miss Becker, I think it's safe to rule out any chance of a tapeworm. Yes. That just leaves me being pregnant. It certainly does. Oh, my God. I was kidding. I'm so sorry. I... I thought this would come as welcome news. Thank you. You know, there are options. Out of state, unfortunately. But also, I could talk to the father if you wished. Long gone. Didn't even give me a real name. Plus I don't really believe in the, uh... option. I see. I promise, I usually make good decisions. Of course. Um... What about family or friends? I'm sorry. This really is none of my business. Um, my mom lives in Florida. She might, uh... Oh, I really don't want to give her another reason to call me a failure. This does not make you a failure. Right. I guess I'm having a baby. Uh... Oh, yes. You are. Oh, I'm sorry. Sometimes I can be a little emotional, too. It's refreshing. It's nice to know I'll be in good hands. Ah. Uh, I guess I have some planning to do. Uh... Um, would you mind if I took a photo of you? - A photo? - Yeah. Just for the records. To match a face to the names. Sadly, at my age, my memory needs a bit of a reminder. Sure. I'm sure I look my best. Um, should I say "cheese"? Say "miracle." Miracle. No, no! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You won't find him here, sweetie. No, no! You don't have to do this. Please don't do this. You don't have to do this. No, no. Just a little bit. - It'll only take a minute. - Please don't do this. Please don't do this. All right. There you go. You don't have to do this. The worst... The worst is over. It's all right. All right. We ask for an audience. We wish to invite our dark lord to a seat at the head of our home. We welcome you. Please don't do this. Please don't do this. My blood is your blood. My blood is your blood. Don't hurt my baby. Please don't hurt my baby. Please don't hurt my baby, no! Start reading. Nos invite Surgot in domum nostram. Placere reserare fores condemnabitur. Keep going. Rogamus autem vos recludam haec processerat. Hoc reserare in domum suam. I see you! Oh, Jackson. Oh, he's here. Jackson, come and take the baby. Go on, Jackie. You can do it. Go on. Keep reading. Nos invite mortuis. Nos invitare in domum nostram. Are you all right? Yeah. I'm fine. Henry... She's okay. Let me hear. Here. It's him. Audrey... I know my grandson's heartbeat. Yes, yes. Of course you do. I'm sorry. We did it. I'll put on some tea. Aud? Had a hell of a time sleeping last night. I guess side effects are to be expected. Sorry. Bad joke. It's all going to work out. I had my doubts, but you were right. Hello? Henry, can you give me a hand with the groceries? You're not still in bed, are you? Audrey? Get away. Keep... Audrey! Audrey! What's wrong? What? I, I... You... No. I'm right here. What? - What? - All those things. Well, you just... What? Look. There's nothing there. Hello? Excuse me, Dr. Walsh. There's an officer here to see you. An officer? Yes. She said she'd like to speak with you. I'll be right there. Okay. Dr. Walsh? - Yes? - Detective Bellows. Is something wrong? I'm looking into a missing persons case. Do you know a Miss Shannon Becker? Oh, yes. Of course. - She's a patient. - Yeah? Well, unfortunately, she hasn't been to work in a couple of days, and she has quite a few people worried. Oh. Well, that's just awful. Um, do you have any leads? Well, we're retracing her steps. Miss Becker had an appointment to see you on the same day that she went missing. What time did she come in? Ah. Well, actually, um, she cancelled that day. Do you know when she called? Do you keep phone records, by chance? I'd love to have a listen. Actually, she didn't call. Really? Well, remember, I asked you if she called, and then you said that you saw her earlier in the day. Right, doctor? Oh, right. Thank you, Talia. My mistake. Yes. I saw her walking. - Walking? - Uh-huh. And where was this? Um... Do you remember what street? Time of day? Anything would be helpful. Um, yeah. I was on my way to work. She walked by my house. It would've been about 9:00, 9:30. Sorry. I should've remembered. Oh, no, no, no. It's okay. Which street was this? My street. Hibiscus Avenue. Thank you. This has been very helpful. Both of you. Well, please keep us posted. You're panicking. She was in my office. Well, we knew this. It's not a shock, Henry. We planned for it. They came in, and you told them that she'd cancelled her appointment. And then they'll look at her updates and her dating app and see that she met a stranger. We've been all through this. Well, there was some confusion. I had to tell the police that I saw her walk... What? Well, it's fine. Nothing changes. I just said that I saw her walking and she cancelled. What reason did she give for cancelling? Well, we didn't... Did she go left or right at the bottom of the hill? - I mean... - I know what you're doing. Why were you watching her all the way down to the bottom of the hill? Are you attracted to younger girls, Henry? It's not a plan if you don't stick to it. All right, now. I'm sorry. I made a mistake. But we'll go over all this tonight. Okay, Audrey? - Damn it. - What's the matter? Well, it's probably the police at the door. I'm coming. Trick or treat? What? Trick or treat? That's not very funny. I don't like games. Whoever put you up to this is just cruel. Please don't knock again. Trick or treat? Trick or treat? No! Trick or treat? Please? Hello? Henry? Henry, I need help. What's wrong? She's trying to get me. Trick or treat? Get out! Maybe you should give her your soul. What? Trick or treat? - Trick or treat? - What? Trick or treat? What? Trick or treat? Trick or treat? Trick or treat? Oh. Oh, God. Trick or treat? Trick or treat? Trick or treat? No. Why were you screaming? Screaming? Earlier. I heard you screaming. My daughter just came to see me. She used to dress as a ghost every year for Halloween. I tried to get her into a princess costume or a ballerina, anything other than that darn ghost. But they like what they like. I can't believe I tried to change that. Seems so silly now, when I look back. Where's your daughter now? I love my Jackson. And Jackson loves his gammy's cookies. I'm going to make some right now. Whoa, whoa! I can't get the door open. Aud? What the hell is going on? She's all stitched up. No real damage. I'm so sorry. No. Whatever this is, we both did it. You know, I think we're in over our heads. Well, we can't Google this. Do you think we made a mistake? Let's get some sleep. Good morning. Right on schedule. If I don't do it in the morning, I don't do it. And someone seems to crave the consistency. Better get used to it. Pretty soon, that little person will be calling all the shots. I am. Sorry? Um, getting used it, I mean. I know I was apprehensive. But, uh, I was laying in bed the other day worrying about bills and formula. And all of a sudden, this little mush starts squirming. Yeah, right. It made all my worries go away. I finally found my family. They do have a way of getting into your heart, don't they? They really do. Well, I'm glad that you're excited to be a mom. You have no idea. Um, I'll see you Thursday? Wouldn't miss it. Are there more? Yes. How can you tell? I tend to notice a murder of crows in my backyard. It's because of what we did? Yep. It's because of what we did. Oh, no. What's he doing here? Go on upstairs. Keep her quiet. Dr. Walsh? Morning. I'm here to clean your drive. Uh, yeah. I thought we talked about this. We're still okay. Pretty sure you and I got a different meaning of "okay." Yes, but I called, though. What's that? Um, after last time, uh, I called your wife, and I explained that I wouldn't need you for a month or two. We're not firing you or anything. We just don't need you. Oh, boy. Full disclosure here, doc. I haven't been home in a while. Is that right? The number you called is Jenny. On account of taxes, everything's in her name, and she's gone and chucked me. I mean, I get it. I made a mistake. A stupid, stupid mistake. And now, will you look at all this, huh? I'm going to lose my business, my home. Cripes. She won't even let me see my two girls. How the hell is that fair? I'm sorry to hear that, Rory. But maybe you could, um, send her some flowers or something. Oh! What am I doing? This isn't on you. No. Uh... That's it. It's over. No more. Well, that's good to know. Um, I'll be seeing you, then, Rory. No, no, no. I'm not leaving. You're getting a freebie. No, no. Everything's okay. No. It's settled. You need it. I need it. Done-zo. I am hooking you up. Henry? What the hell was that? Don't yell at me. I am not a doctor. I thought you told me you cancelled him? I did! He wouldn't take no for an answer. Hey! Hey! Oh... Hey, Mrs. Walsh! Wave. Hi! Smile. Glad you're feeling better! Thank you, Rory. Hey. Hey... What's wrong? I just... I don't know what the other ghosts are. I don't know why they're here. What if we did it all wrong? What if... What if Jackson's not... No. In a few days, we'll have Jackson back, we'll head to Mexico... Okay. And I'll burn this house down, ghosts and all. I promise. Hey! You did it right. Jackson's in there. He's coming back to you. Stay the hell away from me. No, I-I'm just here to clean you, nothing else. All right. There we go. Oh... Wrists are just not getting any blood circulation. Please don't move. There. Okay. This will just make it a lot... softer for you. Okay? I hope this works. You ready? There. How does that feel? Are you gonna kill me? When this is over and you have your grandson back? You're not saying anything. There's... a... lot of words in silence. Does that mean yes? Shannon, the first rule we set for ourselves was that you cannot get hurt. You know, you remind me of her. Your daughter? She was such a good girl. She was always so much smarter than the other kids. She always knew what she wanted. Did you try and bring her back? I don't think she can come back. She was in the car, but... we didn't lose her right away. We... We renovated this house to give her everything she needed. Henry and I tried to make her as comfortable as possible, so that she could... try to move on. But... I didn't realize how impossible it is to move on after losing a child... until I lost mine. But you know, I know that she would be happy knowing that you're helping bring our Jackson back. Oh, God damn it. Yes. Hello? Dr. Walsh? It is. This is Detective Bellows. We met a few days ago at your office. Uh-huh. Sorry to disturb you. I'm just following up on a few notes. I remembered you saying you saw Miss Becker walking the morning she went missing. I wondered if I could come see you for a quick chat? Uh, yes, of course. Always happy to help. Have you had any luck in finding Miss Becker? Um... I saw on the news that you might have got a suspect. I'm not at liberty to discuss that with you. No, of course. I was just, uh, concerned about her. You know that, um, she... she's due to give birth any day now. Uh-huh. Can I come by your house? Well, actually, I'm out right now. But how about we meet at the clinic tomorrow morning first thing? Aww, Doctor, time is of the essence in these circumstances, you understand. Well, of course. Um... Yes. You know, I... actually, I could be there in... in... in an hour. I'm actually in your neighbourhood. Let's meet at your house. Ahh! I would help. What do you mean? Be Jackson's mom... with you and Dr. Walsh. You're just saying that. Yeah, Henry told me that... that you would try and use my emotions against me. Shame on you. I'm not... I... I... I don't... agree with this, but... I understand it. Doing anything for him. I'm just trying to do the same for my baby. I don't know. You and Dr. Walsh aren't young. You're gonna need someone to look after Jackson. You can lock me up in a room. I don't care. I just... I just... I just want to be a part of the baby's life. Do you really think you could do that? Like, if I talk to Henry, you're not just saying it? I do. I'll do whatever you want. Please. I'm sorry. I'll come back and take that off in a minute. Henry Walsh! Henry, I tried to stop her! Place your hands on your head and get on your knees. Are you okay, my love? Henry, I'm so sorry! Henry Walsh, get down on your knees now. - Let me go! - I'm sorry. No, it's all me, Officer. Please. My... my wife had nothing to do with this. Please. Please, let her go. Let me up, please. You have to help my baby. Dr. Walsh, I am placing you under arrest for the kidnapping of Miss Shannon Becker. Please! Please, no! Just let me out of here. Miss Becker, calm down. You have to let me out. I know you're afraid, but it's all over now. I just have to do this one thing. Oh, Henry... It can't be... Can you help me? Henry... There we go. Oh my God. Don't look. Did she call for backup? I don't know. - The cop. - What? Did she call for backup? - No, no. - No? No, she heard Becker. I tried to get rid of her, Henry. I tried to get rid of her. I know. Let's... let's get her away from here. - What? - Come on. Oh my God. I'll get an arm, you get an arm. Get her arm. Come on. Where are we gonna take her? Back side, just right in the corner. All right. All right. Good. Will you please stop that? I'm nervous. I'm aware. We need to talk about Becker. She and I were chatting. I-I know I'm always the one yelling about plans, but just hear me out. Later, okay? Do you actually have it? Like, actually have it? Come inside. Where did you find this? I went to a museum. Talked to some historians. One of them sent me to another guy, and another guy. Eventually, I flew to Jerusalem and bought it off a very shady-looking individual, who seemed only too pleased to be rid of it. How much did it cost? Well, we don't have a retirement plan left. Can you read it, Ian? Of course I can read it. Some of it, not all of it. It looks like it was written... over a bunch of years. There's different languages, there's different dialects and religions. This might be the oldest book in the world. Ian? We're friends, right? I don't have friends. But we're bound to each other with the church. Of course. So... could you show what you make of this here, where it says "the invoking", where you can invite a spirit into a new vessel? Well, first of all, you can't invite a specific... Did you guys do this? Wh-wh-what if we did? Then, I'd be an idiot for standing here. So... It's okay. Okay. You guys... need to tell exactly, exactly... Uh-huh. ...what you did right now. Um... okay, well, we, uh... yeah, we asked this one to bring our grandson back. You asked Surgat to bring him back? The book said he could. No. Henry... your translations are so far off. Yes, this is Surgat, the demon who unlocks the gate between us and tormented souls. And, yes, technically, he is the first step in bringing... someone back, but it's not a private goddamn VIP invitation. Okay, once that gate is open, every ghost in purgatory is gonna be crawling to find a host. What host did you use? Is she alive? Yes. Uh, sedated. When did you... when did you do it? A few days ago. This is hers? No. That's... someone else's. Is Jackson in there? Who's Jackson? Um, our grandson... the reason that we're doing this. Oh. Um... No. But he can be. He can be. You guys only did half the ceremony. I'm not gonna... praise you for your choices, but... you actually did the right thing. Now, you need to follow up. Trade the life, invite him in. Trade? The mother trades her life, so the tormented can come back. You... you think that you can perform this? Of course I can. I studied my whole life for this. I just can't believe it's real. I get to keep the book when we're done. Of course. And $10,000 as well. I don't have a lot of money and... you seem to have more. No problem. When do you think that you could do this? How quickly? ASAP. As soon as possible. Tomorrow work for you guys? I'm gonna have get some stuff. I'm assuming you've seen some ghosts, huh? Mm-hmm. You're gonna need salt, rock salt, kosher only. Spread it all around this... woman here. That unborn baby's literally a free ticket back to life for those things. Salt keeps them away? I don't fucking know, Henry. But I've read it helps, so do it. Okay? And put it around yourselves, too. You aren't ideal, but they're not picky. I think I'm gonna... go. I don't really feel safe being here... until we do this. He says you have to kill me. Mm-hmm. Mrs. Walsh said that I could be the mom to Jackson. Did she talk to you about that? How many more people have to die just to bring your grandson back? All of them. Whatever it takes. Rory, the cop, you, me. You can't win a moral argument with me. I've made a deal with the devil. You haven't made the deal yet. I made that deal the day we lost Jackson. I know you love him. Her. When it happened, she couldn't remember a thing, but I know that she was distracted. She didn't resist fussing over Jackson, especially on car rides. She was driving a car? I realize that she couldn't accept what happened and I couldn't expect her to... come back up. So... I joined her, going back down. You're doing all this for her? I do everything for her. I'm sorry. People say "sorry" instead of fixing things. You could fix this, but you choose not to. So... you aren't. What if... I hope that happens for the rest of your life. Ian, come to supper please. Not hungry. I'll keep it warm in the oven for you. Are you sure you don't want something? Just a little? Sweetie, I really don't mind. I'll bring down to you. Not fucking hungry! Henry? Audrey? Guys? Guys? She's been doing that all night. Don't step on the salt. Okay. Turn to the page with the bookmark, read it. "Hoc autem..." "Hoc au-tem". "Hoc autem satanas in domum suam, "invenit eum coram te relinquo." What does it mean? The salt slows them down... The sacrifice keeps them away. This will help keep them out... until... we're ready... to do this. Don't disturb it, please. One of you starts with... this. I know it's in here... somewhere. One of you starts with this. The other, come with me. One, two, three, four, five, six. Here. Here. You know when it comes time, you're gonna have to be the one to kill her, Henry. I can't do that for you. You don't have to worry about that. I'll take care of it. You can't hesitate. Okay? If he senses that you're not ready, Henry... Henry! ...we'll all die. We'll all die. I'm not saying this to be mean, but this is your deal. I'm just here to broker it. I told you, I'll take care of it. Ian, this will work, right? He's listening, Henry. He actually wants to hear you. Please don't ever doubt him in my presence again. Three more to go. Is it today? It is. And you spoke to Dr. Walsh? About me coming with you? Raising Jackson with you? We did. He thinks it's a great idea. So, when this is over and you have Jackson, with the ceremony... ...you're gonna let me out of these? We are. We're... we're even gonna have a room for you, with a crib and everything. I was thinking, uh, maybe we could send my mom a picture of the baby when he's born? We're not close, but, uh... She'll still be really excited to be a grandma. Well, that's a great idea. Let's do that. I'm kind of hungry. I... I just want to make sure I have my strength for this. Okay. Let me fix you something. Shannon? Mrs. Walsh! - Mrs. Walsh! - What? My water broke. Oh my goodness. Henry! Henry! She never starts meetings with a blessing, she never acknowledges the work that I do to make those meetings even fucking happen. You think that twat could help you with this? No, no. You're certainly the one that should be running it. Yeah. She doesn't even care about the church. She's a stupid... stupid skank. Speak of the devil. Henry! All right. Let's get this off. How much time between contractions? It's hard to tell. I... Ahh! What are you waiting for? Okay. "Nos obsecro in auditorium. "Rogamus autem satanas iungere nobis ad mensam." What if Jackson's not in there? "Nos obsecro in auditorium..." He'll be in there. Just focus on her. "...iungere nobis ad mensam." "Satanas animas..." Wretched thing. It's working. It's working. It's working. "Satanas animas "tibi offerimus pro vase. "Veni nobis, accipe solio tuo. "Nos obsecro in auditorium..." Henry... Say it. I've been trying to get a hold of you. What's wrong? It's Ian. He fucking snapped, man. He killed his mother last night, drew a bunch of fucking symbols on the wall. The police are asking me about the church. I don't even believe in this shit, you know? Henry? Hello? Henry! Fuck. Something's wrong with Ian. Just don't say anything. Everything all right, Henry? Fine. Just, uh... Just keep going. "Nos obsecro in auditorium. "Rogamus autem satanas esum. "Iungere nobis "requium ad mensam. "Satanas iungere nobis tibi..." - Ian? - "...offerimus pro vase." How do we know when Jackson's inside? "Veni nobis..." When it's finished! You want to see your fucking grandson? Shut up! I know what I'm fucking doing! "Solio tuo..." Ahh! Ahh! Don't hurt her! - Henry... - Undo my legs. Don't. No! Don't do it. Henry, please don't do it. Undo my legs or, I swear, I'll cut her throat! No! No! "Satanas..." don't! Don't! Don't! Give me the keys! Give me the keys! No! I know you won't let me hurt her. Do it! "Veni nobis, accipe..." - Give to me! - Don't fucking do it! Henry, don't do it. You dumb fucking shit! We need her! Okay?! This is bigger than your stupid fucking bitch wife! No! No! Ahh! Henry... Fucking idiot. You fucking idiot. Ian, please, I just want my Jackson back, please. I just want my Jackson. Oh! Mother's a mother. Henry... It's all right. It's okay. What are you doing? Stop! It's okay. I'm giving him a home! Take whichever one you want! Cleanse the earth of these fucking sheep! Vas, tuum est! I'm cold. Take mulieri! Just need a blanket. Veni nobis Vanth! I love you, Audrey. He's coming. He's coming! And you, you can't fucking stop him! Ahh! Fuck! Fucking bitch! Shh... Henry! Henry! Henry! Henry! Henry! Get him off me! Help me! Audrey... Ahh! Ahh! Go. Shannon... forgive us. Audrey? Dr. Walsh, come on! Ahh... Trick or treat. Miss Becker, your safe now. Come with me. Miss Becker, what are you running from?! I can help you! You gotta let me see my kids, Jenny! How's this fair to me?! You're not taking my motherfucking kids, Jenny! You're the one that cheated! You're the one who ruined this family!
