SECOND REPORTER: Alex, this is the third time that this kind of thing has happened in a case against the Chief of Police.

You have to do the right thing. You know, just save it, all right? You just save it for the police. When we get there, - you can tell them all about your story. - Ben Rose is the Chief of Police.

[ Speaking Afrikaans ] Look, Michael, I'm not the one just out of jail for hit and run, okay? It was an accident, and I paid my dues. You don't know me. SMITH: You do seem to have a bit of a knack at being in the wrong place at the wrong time, don't you, Mr. Woods? Anyway, here's the situation. You've broken your parole conditions, making you a wanted felon. You're alone in a city you've never been to before, whereas I, on the other hand, have access to the entire police force here. I know the car you're in. I know its color, its plates. I also have people waiting for your ex-wife to take one step out of that embassy. One step, and she's mine. So what are you gonna do?

SMITH: Tough life, huh? [ Chuckles ] You know, that chuckle of yours, it reminds me of him, 'cause he had one just like it, a sadistic-ass chuckle. And, you know, even though he's dead, every time I screw up, I can still hear it. Are you a mean bastard, Detective Smith? SMITH: Be very, very careful here. "Cause you know what's more powerful than a mean bastard with too much power? SMITH: You're playing with fire. A man with nothing to lose, Detective Smith. SMITH: I will kill you.
