I think it's perfect. I made it for you. When I can't watch over you both, he will. As he always does. You sure I can't persuade you to stay? I wish I could. I don't like it when you leave. Especially with what's going on out there. I won't be long, love. That's it. It's all there. Good man. Oh, thanks, Ben. - Cheers. - Cheers. Joseph. -Squire. -How's that family of yours? Very well. In times like these, that's blessing enough. - In times like these, I wouldn't let a woman like Grave out of my sight. Here, let me light your pipe. Oh, thank you. -Leave him be, Leonora. He's a married man. Jesus. Joseph? It's okay my love. Just go back to bed. No, Grace. Stay where you are. Don't come any closer. Joseph, you're scaring me. What's wrong? Don't touch me! Please. Oh, my God. It's the sickness. I just have a fever is all. I don't want you and Abby succumbing to it. All right. I'll go to the forest to fetch some elderberry to make a tonic. That should help break the fever. Grace... Grace. I love you. Won't be long. Sorry. The squire wants a word with you. - Squire? - Mrs. Haverstock. You don't usually make house calls. Well, I heard rumor that your husband had succumbed to the sickness. Such a pity that he should be cut down in his prime. But then the Lord moves in mysterious ways. That he does. And what of yourself and the child? We must wait it out in solitude and pray the Lord has spared us. And if you do find yourself in his favor, what then? Surely you don't mean to persist out here, a frail young woman alone in this isolated place? I'm not alone. I have my daughter. And there is work to be done. I must persist. I see. And I trust you'll be able to pay the rent. It's due in a week, and if you cannot fulfill your obligation, your tenancy will be forfeit. You'll lose everything. Your sympathy at this difficult time is the most touching. Mind your tongue, woman. My sympathies lie where I choose. This is business and nothing more. We all have our stations in life, and I'm sorry that yours is beneath mine, but there it is. I'll come back. If you're still alive, I shall expect the rent paid in full. If not, well, then we'll call it quits. Don't worry, Squire. You'll have your money. It happened this time. I'm sure of it. Sure of what? Of a child. How could you possibly know that? A woman just knows these things. Come here. Come here. Kate? Grace? Oh. It's all right, Kate. We've gone a week now and showed no signs. All the same, Kate, it might be wise to keep... - Thank the Lord. - Never mind. When we heard the news, we feared the worst. We're glad to see that you're all right. We're very sorry to hear about Joseph. He were a good friend. Thank you, Morton. That means a lot. - Where are you going? - I have to go into town. Grace, no! It's too dangerous. The sickness is rife there. Morton, she's going into town. Well, why would you want to do a damn fool thing like that? I have no choice. That's something I must do. Then leave Abby with me. - No. - You can ride faster and be back sooner. Very well. You and Morton have been like family to me ever since I came here. Then take some sisterly advice and don't dally. The shadow of death hangs over that place. Come on. I won't be there a moment longer necessary. I'll be back before dark. Mr. Tuttle? Aye? That's right. You don't know me, but you were a friend of my husband's, Joseph Haverstock. That I was. It's a bloody shame what happened. I'm sorry for your loss. He always did right by you, didn't he? Why don't you come to the point, Mrs. Haverstock? I hate to come here like this. I didn't know where else to turn. I need money. A small loan. I see. I can't help you. But... The Squire will evict us if we don't pay. Times are tough. What must I do? Beg? Begging won't make any difference. It's the sickness. People are scared. They're seeing the devil under their beds or hiding in the woodshed. He arrested Molly Pryor just two days ago for witchery. Molly Pryor? She's just a harmless old woman. She confessed to all charges. I'll give you some advice because Joseph was my friend and he didn't deserve to go the way I did. Leave town while you can. That day when Joseph came into town, what happened? He delivered the grain, then came in for a drink, as usual. But there was a man here from outside the village with the sickness. Joseph drank from the wrong cup. An honest mistake. And from that moment, he was done for. You saw this? I heard it. From who? Well, the Squire, of course. Come on. Do as you must, love. Grace. Good morning, Mrs. Haverstock. Suppose you've come for your money. All in good time. Mind if I come in? Never fails to impress me how so many can live on so little. How are you holding up? I can only imagine how difficult it is with all you've been through. We're getting by. Could I trouble you for a libation? We only have ale. A cool ale would hit the spot. Poor child. Won't be easy for her growing up without a father. Having suffered the loss of my own mother as a child, I do believe it deprived my character of the more tender sentiments. I'm sorry. About your mother, I mean. Oh, don't be. She was a whore. My father beat her to death with an iron skillet when he caught her looking at another man. Cheers. Eviction is such thirsty work. Then this should keep you imbibed for a while. For three months at least. I'm impressed. What about the next month and the month after? Surely you don't expect me to believe that you're going to work this land whilst tending to an infant... - We'll manage. - And you'll fail. All you will have achieved is to delay the inevitable. Another three months. Satisfied? Doesn't have to be this way. An arrangement could be reached. You could cover your rent by... other means. Other means? Well, let's not mince words. You have your money. Now please leave. You should count yourself bloody lucky. You think I make an offer like this to just anyone. Get off or me! Get your hands off of me! I saw how you were with Joseph, flaunting your tender body like bait on a fishhook, reeling him in with the promise of succulent quim. Please stop this! You can feel me, can't you? -Get off of me! Get out! You're hardly in a position to be choosy, not after your husband's misfortune. Get out. Make me. You got some fight in you. I like that. That's more like it. On your knees. Relax. You might even enjoy it. Aaah! Now get the hell out of my house! - Come here, you little shit! - Aaah! You'll pay for this, harlot. Ha! -Come on. They murdered her. What re you talking about? I never told you about my mother. I was very young. It was early on the Sabbath when they came for. My father tried to stop them, but he was helpless to prevent it. A few days later we were summoned to Blackthorne Castle to hear the verdict. The whole village came out. They were too afraid not to. For fear of Judge Moorcroft, the witch finder. Would you let your shame fall on your daughter's shoulders? Don't you dare hurt her! Then confess, or you condemn her as you condemn yourself. All right, I confess. I didn't hear you. I confess, damn you! Moorcroft declared my mother a witch and sentenced her to death. Burn her. I didn't understand what was happening. All I knew is that they were taking away my mother. I'm sorry, Grace. I wasn't strong enough. Don't be afraid. Promise me, always stay true to yourself. Let no one tell you who you are. Take her away. And I had to watch. Please! As they burned her alive. I should have told you. You deserve to know who I am. I know who you are. And I love you. This, us... it's all that matters. You and the baby are the most precious thing to me. I'll do anything to keep you safe. I know. Your mother... she was innocent. It doesn't matter. Innocent or not, she confessed. That makes her a witch. Ale. Make it quick. Rough day, Squire? Keep your insolent tongue inside your wretched head. Just asking, Squire. It was that damn Haverstock woman, if you must know. I only went round to collect the rent. She flew into a rage and attacked me. The woman's a menace. You mean she doesn't fancy you? It's written all over your face, Squire. One more word. Your rent's coming up soon, isn't it? I'd hate to have to it raise it. That goes for all of you! I own you! Remember that! What I mean is, does anyone know what really happened to Joseph? She claims the sickness took him. But what about her and her baby, too? I tell you. There's something wicked at work in that place. I saw her in town the other day. Acting bloody peculiar, she was. She and Molly Pryor were close friends, I heard tell. Joseph was showing me interest until she came along. She must have beguiled him. There's only one thing that can explain it. She made a pact with the devil. Grace Haverstock's a witch. She came here looking for money. I sent her away. Then I reckon you're fucked, mate. She and Molly were in league. Killing one witch didn't rid us of the sickness. Then we burn her, too. Did somebody say witch? Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh. Sleep soundly, my little one. Got to prime it first, or don't work so good. Who are you? What do you want? We want you, witch. Aaah! Witch! She's a feisty one, isn't she? Nowhere to run, witch. Yeah, look. She bleeds like the rest of us. Let's go. No sense taking any chances. Now, that's how you deal with witches. No! What have you done? You were supposed to bring her in, not but the house to the ground. She was going to burn anyway, so what's the difference? It's my property, you moron. Morton, how could you? What are you doing? Alright, well, she's dead now. So naught can be done about it. She's not bloody dead, you useless fools! She escaped down the back. I should have known it wouldn't be so easy to rid ourselves of you. Grace Haverstock, you stand accused of the crimes of witchcraft and making unholy covenant with the devil. What say you to these charges? Bring me the child. No! No! No! Not my baby! Grace! - Quit your struggling. - No! - So innocent. - No! My baby! Won't harm a hair on her head. Abby! What's this then? Another witch? - Got another witch for you. - Ah. I'm no witch. That's what they all say, darling. Not often we get one as fine as you down here. Hey! Come on. You! You can see it, can't you? The seeds of our destruction have already taken root. Shut it, you! Come on, don't make this any bloody harder. Come on. Don't keep on struggling. Right. Here, give me that. Yes, and enemy who sowed them is the devil. For the harvest is the close of the age. Welcome to Paradise. I want to see my baby. I want to see my daughter. Damn you! How could you? She's your friend. She's your friend. At least she was. What do you mean by that? You'll have nothing more to do with her. Do you understand? The Squire would take away everything we had if he knew we were associated with that witch. But Grace is not a witch! Enough! I'll hear no more of it. Or do you want to be chained up alongside your friend? All it takes is a word. Mama? - Wait. - I can't stay. A moment, that's all I ask. I'm forbidden to speak to you. Psst. Are you okay? It's okay. They've gone now. What's your name? Astrid. Where's your family, Astrid? They're all gone. The sickness took them. I'm so sorry. You don't look much like a thief. What'd you do to end up in here? Nothing. That's what I told them. But they beat me. And kept on beating me till I confessed to stealing a chicken and a loaf of bread. But I was starving. I had no choice. Soul of Christ, sanctify me. Blood of Christ, wash me. Body of Christ save me! Blood of Christ, inebriate me. And him? Reverend Malcolm, he's out of his mind. He talks to himself day and night. He thinks that the sickness is the devil's work, that the end of times is here. You must be strong tomorrow. What's to happen to me? They'll try to break you. Like they did to poor old Molly. And the rest of us. Sooner or later, he breaks everyone. You mustn't let him. Behold, thou witch! - There she is! - Witch! - Witch! - Witch! - Witch! - Witch! - Witch! - Get away! I'll break your bloody skull! - Witch! - That's for Joseph, witch! Witch! Witch! Woman, cry no, we won't. Woman, cry no, we won't. Cry no, we won't. Aaah! Give it to her! Yes! Hurt her! Your friend Molly Pryor here only managed two days before she spilled her guts. Doesn't have to be this way. I could still help you, if you'd let me. Did you help Molly, too? Or was she not your type? I suspected I was going to have trouble with you, so I've sent for help from some more skilled in the art of persuasion, the witch finder John Moorcroft. So why not spare yourself the pain, confess. Your conscience will be clear. My conscience is already clear. Where is my daughter? What have you done with her? I haven't done anything with her. You think I'd harm an innocent child? What kind of man do you take me for? I take you for a fool and a coward. You have an insolent tongue, witch. You're lucky that I'm feeling charitable today. Otherwise, I take great pleasure in cutting it out. But I warn you, judgment is coming. And he won't be so forgiving. Let him come. - God bless all here. - Welcome, sir. Care for a drink? My companion and I have been on the road since dawn We require food, libation. Take a seat. I'll have the food sent over. Thank you. Moorcroft, is it? - Aye. - That's him, all right. George Moorcroft. Butcher and bastard. Hey, Watkins, you're drunk. Leave the man be. You have me at a disadvantage, sir. You appear to know me, but I must confess, I'm at a total loss. No, I don't suppose you do remember me. Just another grieving husband amongst the countless that you've left behind. Sir, your wife was a witch then? My wife was no witch. Mistakes are made. Mistake? Is that what it was? If that helps. The only thing that'll help me is seeing you dead. Watkins, don't! There's no need for bloodshed. What in the name of God happened to you? The judge showed me the path to truth. Open your heart, and he will show you, too. Get the hell out of my way. Aah! For some, the truth is beyond them. Come, Ursula. I fear we've outstayed our welcome. You can be as selfless as you like. You can't win. We're innocent. I don't care. That man's got the sickness. Is that right? You're not just a pretty face, are you then? Come on, then. Whew. The sickness, eh? All the more reason to keep him locked up. Fresh water straight from the river. For all it's worth. I thought you were forbidden to speak to me. Well, they'll punish me I do. You'll curse me if I don't. You know why I'm really here. All I ask is news of my daughter. I don't know anything. Ask around. Anything you can find out, please. Sorry, I have to go. And I looked, beheld a pale horse. His name who sat on him was Death. Hell followed with him. Judge Moorcroft, thank you for your swift response. We're in need of your expertise in this matter. Has my equipment arrived? It got here just before you did. - Good. Take me to her. - So soon? After such a long journey, would you not prefer to rest? The devil never rests. Nor must we. She has a bed in her cell? Yes, it's crude, but it's enough to sleep on. We must get rid of it. You're too lenient. And if she sleeps, you douse her with ice water. She's in league with the dark one. Never forget that. Fear not, my child. Salvation is at hand. Have food and wine sent to my room. I must prepare. There is God's work to be done. Joseph. Grace. Grace. Joseph. Joseph? No! She won't last long. I don't know. There's something about her, something different. - Different? - Yeah. Well, witch or not, I'd still do her. You're a sick bastard, Peck. She'll curse you, make your balls drop off. I'd still do her. Never forget who you are. Wake up, witch! It's time. Grace Haverstock, I am confused. The depositions are unanimous, and the evidence is clear. Yet you persist in claiming your innocence. Now, you must understand that you have put me in a very difficult position. But when dealing with the forces of darkness, I cannot afford to be reckless. The devil, Grace, is deceitful, and it is my sworn duty to uncover the truth. Oh. You won't be needing this anymore. For this is between you and I now, Grace. It's a battle of wills, if you like, and I warn you of this. My will is greater than yours. We'll see. Well, let us begin. Gentlemen. Strap her in. Sister Agatha, you may proceed with the examination. We have something. And there we have it! Clear as day! The devil's mark. Tell me something, my dear. When you fornicate with the beast, does his bite sting? Come on! No, I don't want to go back in there. You will go where you are bloody well told. And cover yourself up. I brought you extra bread and cheese. - Do you duties, boy! - I've got to go. Just don't give up. The judge is begging for his wine. - What news from London? - Oh, London is lost. Thousands have fled to the safety of the countryside. Bodies are piled high in the narrow streets. Burial parties struggle to cope, so the stench of rotting flesh hangs over the city like putrid fog. And the rats... The rats are everywhere. It's as if the day of judgment has finally arrived. All the more reason we should seek out and destroy evil where we find it, don't you think? Easier said than done. Grace may be stubborn, but she will break. You'd be surprised. Such is the power of conviction. Well, maybe you're just not hurting her enough, You really are a vicious brute, aren't you? Coming from you, I'll take that as a compliment. I just hope we didn't bring you here for nothing. She has the devil inside her. Any fool can see that. You will have your confession. I guarantee it. Joseph. There, my love. I'm with you. Oh, I want to see you. Open your eyes. Oh. A sign of despair. I care not for your flesh. I just want your soul. What did I tell you? No sleeping! They usually give up by now. Hm. You playing, or what? What if she's innocent like she says? Does she go to Hell? Or do we? Look around you, mate. We're already here. Roll. Shit! What's with all these bloody rats all of a sudden? Have you seen any cats lately? Roll. Grace, Grace! I have news. Tell me, please. Your daughter is in the keeping of the Squire in the South Tower. A nurse maid is called to attend to her needs. - She's safe. - She's not safe. Not with him. That's all I know. - Thank you. - Make sure you eat. I feel it is time that we discussed the recent passing of your husband, Joseph. I hear from the Squire that he succumbed to the sickness. And given the circumstance, I felt the need for absolute certainty. And so I had his body exhumed. And although his death by pestilence was a foregone conclusion, you could only imagine how perplexed I was to find... ...this... ...hanging around his stretched neck. Now, I did not know your husband, Grace, but by all accounts, I hear that he was a good man, that he was a kind man, that he was a godly man. Which makes me wonder, why would such a man commit the mortal crime of taking his own life unless it was the witch he was fool enough to marry or the devil himself? Admit it, Grace, please. Admit it, that you... that you cursed him and you sent an innocent man to the bowels of hell! Take her down. Repent your sins, redeem your soul. Free yourself. Begin. Take her away. You, boy! Give me a hand. For the love of God, why did you do this? Just give them what they want. -I won't. If you continue like this, they're going to kill you. They're going to kill me anyway. I do not fight for my life. Please do not abandon hope. I think hope has abandoned me. There's only way out of this now. Something troubles you, Ursula. She has courage, don't you think? It is but a mask, that is all. I know. Forgive me. Never doubt the virtue of our task. Never mind how difficult or painful it may be. Always remember what she is. The darkness an allure to it. I understand this. And that is why our struggle is so much harder and the Lord's soldiers must be so much stronger. I remember the day the rain came. Deluge direct from Heaven above. And I pulled you from the ashes, purged of evil. And in your heart, a new resolve to enlighten those that had strayed into the darkness. That is true courage, Ursula. That is strength. And that is why I need you by my side. You... are my anchor in the eternal storm. I should have held my tongue. On the contrary, I think it is time that you spoke with her. Stay awake. For you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. Grace. No. It's not you. Don't you know your own husband? My love. I know the devil has many faces. Oh, Grace, please. You're just a dream. But you're awake. Joseph. Joseph! I will not be denied! Mama. I'm sorry. I blamed you and I scolded you. I didn't understand. I did not understand. Fear not, child. The Lord forgives. How did you get in here? What do you want? I mean you no harm. Here, eat. Tell me, what does he say to you? Who? The devil, when he comes to you in the night. - I don't know... - It's okay. You can tell me. I myself spoke with him frequently. I know how it feels. Leave me alone. Get out. I, too, succumbed to temptation, made unholy union with the devil. But Judge Moorcroft showed me the path to truth. You mean he tortured you. Enlightened me. I was in denial at first. But only through the purification of pain did I cleanse my soul. You may hold out for a day. Maybe two. But in the end, you will beg for redemption. Let me help you. We can end this suffering together. Mama. You gave your life for me. Should I give them what they want? You've fought long enough. You can let go now. Free yourself. - Joseph. - Free yourself, my love. Follow the path to truth, Grace. If you won't do it for yourself, then do it for your daughter. Now I see the truth of it. Tell me, how many others have you sent the scaffold or burn to death? Did you convince them that they were witches just as your own accusers convinced you? When you're told something often enough, you start to believe it. What you're unwilling or unable to accept is you were no more the witch then than I am now. So why don't we take your so-called truth and get out? Guard. You should heed my words. The fate of your soul depends upon it. Fate of my soul is a matter between myself and God and no other. Make sure you eat. "Abby's safe. Have her. Get down here, you bloody... - Come on you! - It's the gypsy girl. Wonder what she did. Doesn't matter. Nobody's safe. Grant me strength on this day, oh, Lord. Shield me in your might. Dress me in your armor. That I made deflect the evil schemes of the devil. And what torturous delights have we in store today? I am God's instrument, sir. This is my duty. I take no pleasure in it. Your loss. Bring forth the accused! Make way! Make way! - Witch! - Witch! - Witch! Witch! - Witch! Witch! My God have mercy. Good people, before you stands Grace Haverstock. Now, you all know why she's here. The evidence is damning and taken from your own sworn statements, eyewitness accounts proving her association with Molly Pryor, a convicted witch, and worse still, wanton fornication with a dark one, as evidenced... by the witch's mark upon her body. Now, such lurid testimony should be enough to condemn her, but we have also heard how the pestilence did not take root within her body or that of her infant child. And so I ask you what more proof is needed? Witch, witch. For Pete's sake, stop this! Tell your wife to mind her tongue, or she'll end up there next. Just be quiet. I will not. - Then you'll come with me. - Get her out. I ask you again, in the eyes of God, do you confess? Ursula. Grace, do you know what this is? Its design is simple, but most effective. It has but one purpose... to inflict excruciating pain. To have the desired result, it must be inserted fully. And then the handle must be turned thus. Again... and again. And again until the pain is unendurable. Grace, do not make me do this. Do not make me do this. Suffer no more! Confess. Confess! You can tear my flesh and break my bones, but I will not bear false witness before you or anyone else. I know the truth. And I will endure all of your torments to protect it. For my will... is greater than yours. Take her down. Courage now, my dear Ursula. It is God's work we do here. Let him be your strength. Grace, I beg of you, confess. This is your last chance. Confess. God as my witness, I have done everything in my power to purge your soul of evil, but to no avail. Therefore, I sentence you to death for the grievous crime of malfeasance. Wait, wait, wait. You promised me a confession. A confession is implicit. Who else could withstand such pain other than a witch? Thou shall not suffer a witch to live. Charlatan! The pair of you! She is in league with the devil, and she will burn for it. As will her child. - No. - The bloodline must be severed. No! No! The sentence of this court is final. Not my baby! No! God have mercy on your souls. No! What's the matter? Nothing to say now? - Nothing to say to you. - Oh, suit yourself. Better that way. Don't know what you're so upset about. She lied to us. She had it coming. Why did I marry such an ignorant fool? What did you say? - You heard me. - Say it again. Go on. Say it to my face. I won't be silenced by a coward like you. To hell with you. If that's how you feel, you can bloody well walk home. Is that it? Is that all you got? Didn't you learn anything from what you saw today? I'm not taking your shit anymore! -Oh, is that all you got, eh? It's time I taught you a lesson you're not going to forget in such a hurry. Aaah! What are you gonna do with that, eh? Give me a bloody tooth ache? Well, he smells pretty bad, so it looks like it was the sickness that killed him. So the witch was right then? Yeah. I got your message. But I need more than hope now. Tell me what will they do with old man's body? Dump it in the pit come morning, I expect. Why? I was hoping to escape with Abby tonight. Will you help me? Tell me what to do. Enter. The witch wants to speak with you. She says she's got something important to tell you. Then we better hear what she has to say. Bring her up. Clean yourself up. Put that on. You ought to look respectable for the judge. We'll watch. What the bloody hell do you think you're going to do with that thing? You can't be too careful with the likes of her. Yeah, well, just be careful and don't blow me to smithereens with it. Go with God, my child. His shadow is upon you. Forgive me. Leave us. I believe there's something you wish to tell me, Grace. I'll give you what you want. On one condition. Abby. She really is the most beautiful child, is she not? Please give her to me. All in good time, my dear. What are you doing here, boy? Just pouring the judge's wine, sir. Better get on with it then. So innocent, so pure. I suppose all witches start this way before evil takes root. Being a witch yourself, how do you foresee the future of your daughter Abigail? She dies tomorrow. At my side, by your hand. Oh. So you've come to bargain for her life, have you? Her life is all I ask. If you still want your confession. Very well. Your child shall live. But I have a condition of my own. That she be raised by Ursula as a servant of God. Her salvation demands a strong hand. So she doesn't follow in her mother's footsteps. Now, I feel it is time that you should say goodbye. Never forget that I love you. It's time. I love you, Abby. I love you! There, there, my sweet child. Mother's here. Don't cry. It's just the two of us now, Grace. No more secrets. No more lies. Take a seat. I feel it is time that we raised a cup to honor our deal. I must decline. I never hand the stomach for it. Well, I shan't drink alone. Very well. What difference does it make now anyway. Good point. You know, I can feel the hatred burning inside of you, Grace. Any reasonable person would just let go, so why don't you let go, Grace? Maybe you'll take courage in this. Although I fear it may be too late for you to acquire a taste for it. To courage then. To courage. Now, what is it you want to tell me? I must unburden myself. Then please free yourself. Judge Moorcroft... I wish to confess here and now before the eyes of God, that I am... no witch. Aaah! What is this? A reckoning, judge. You don't remember me, do you? And why would I remember you? I'm the daughter of Jane Hawthorne. You burnt her alive when I was 7 years old. You made me watch. I'm not surprised you don't remember. Just one more innocent woman you've murdered along the way. You know, for years, I thought you were the devil himself. But now I see it. You're just an ordinary man. Wait a moment. What's your hurry? I see no reason why we couldn't become better acquainted. Acquaint yourself with this. My mistake. Not sure I could bear to look at you anyway. If it's repentance you're after, you will receive none. I will continue doing what I do as long as evil stalks this earth, and yes, yes, I do remember your mother. I remember the stench of her as she burned. She was innocent. She gave her life to protect her daughter. Well, we each have our part to play, don't we? That's right. And your part is done. Now it's time to play dead. - What? - The wine, you fool. It's laced with pestilence. But you drunk it, too. I die tomorrow. I just wanted you to know from the woman who killed you, an ordinary woman. Ursula! Save your breath. It's just us now. No more secrets, no more lies. You won't be needing this. Don't make a sound. Leave now. Murdering witch! Edwin, where's Abby? I have her. Let's go. Free yourself. Grace, come on. We have to go out through here. Wait. Guards! Sound the alarm. Grace, what's wrong? I can't go with you. What you're talking about? Wait, no! What have you done?! What needed to be done to protect you both. I don't understand. I drunk the wine. I can't her life or yours. I'm sorry. But the wine wasn't poisoned. What? What? I tried to tell you. Ah. What's good enough for him is good enough for me. No. No! Help me! Oy! You! What do you think you're doing? Hey. Find Kate Tobias. Tell her what happened. She'll know what to do. I won't leave you. You must go. You're a good man, Edwin. Ah, it's the witch. Get her! Come on. Witch! No! Save us! Please! Keys! Get me out of here! Go. Thank you. Good luck. Please, please, hurry, hurry. Come on. Grace! Run! No. No, don't shoot. Don't. Started with your precious husband. I'm going to kill everyone you've ever loved or cared about until I find your daughter. Grace, come on, let's go. Go. I'm not done yet. For the love of God. Where are your gods at now? No, I know you. You're a good woman. Have mercy. You stole all the mercy from my heart. Damn you. You witch! May God have mercy on my soul. Oh, Joseph. I want to be with you now. Grace, you have to get up. You have to live. Abby's out there, and she needs you now. - Abby. - Get up, my love. Get up. Are you hurt? I'm not. Who was that? My husband. What happened? I killed him. I know I'll surely hang. I'm not ashamed. There's been enough death for one night. Abby! Why do you have her? Where's Grace? Oh, Lord, no. Are you Kate Tobias? I was. Grace sent me to find you. She said you'd know what to do. I do. We have to go. Go? Go where? Far from this place. You coming?
