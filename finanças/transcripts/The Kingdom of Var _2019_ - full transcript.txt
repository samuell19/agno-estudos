How are you? Hey, Sonja. Can I come in? Uh, okay. Are you okay? Uh, yeah, I just had deja vu. Hey, how are you? Fine. It's good to see you. When did you get into town? Like, an hour ago, I guess. I've been driving all day and my suitcases are still in the car. Oh. So, how's college been? Fine. You start classes tomorrow, right? Yes. Good thing you needed a roommate. Makes sense since we're best friends. Yeah. Got anything to eat? Uh, the fridge is right there. Help yourself. Hey, I'm vegan, so if you want meat or something, you'll have to go out and get it. Sorry, I can't stand eating blood. Meat is filled with blood. No worries, I got it. Do you mind if I take a shower or something? I've been driving for six hours and I'm fucking disgusting and tired and gross. I'll unpack tomorrow if that's okay. Yeah, that's okay. The bathroom's right down the hall. Your room's downstairs. I can help you move some stuff, if you want. I've been studying most of the day. I was going to go to a party later off campus, if you want to come. Yeah, that sounds great. Cool. Show me where my room is. Cool. It's right here. Haven't been down here much. Just stored some old junk here, that's it. I'm surprised you got this house so cheap. Well, the realtor said the previous owner was a tenant who went insane. That's kind of creepy. Hey, Sonja? Yeah? Have you ever heard of something called 1594? What the fuck was that supposed to be? So, what are you studying anyways? Time-scale calculus. That sounds hard. No, it's fine. I have a photographic memory, that helps. Yeah, I know. What're you studying? Philosophy. Philosophy? Yeah. Why would you want to study that? Philosophy's a waste. You should study a STEM field. Philosophy can answer questions about life that no other science can even touch. I put my faith in evidence. I don't believe what I cannot see. I don't believe in the supernatural. Huh. Well, I guess that's better than studying Latin, which you did. That was a waste. C'mon, we're gonna be late. Well well well, what have we here? It appears we've had some reports of some illicit narcotics being transported onto campus by a young lassie like yourself. In her vagina. Excuse me? I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm going to need some identification. This is Yarda Securities. Campus security! Sonja Fitzgerald, huh? Hey! Well, Miss Fitzgerald, by the 'thority vested in me, you're under suspicion of narcotics trafficking. I'm going to have to subject you to a full anal and vaginal search. What? Take off your pants. Show me your pussy! Hey! Oh, you can't hit me, I'm campus security! Oh, campus security, huh? I'm so impressed. You got your own little taser too? Oh, no. I'm gonna get you, cunt! Thanks. Oh, it's no problem, uh, I'm sorry I couldn't keep him from grabbin' you. It's okay, It's not the first time it's happened. Ah, shit, uh, well, by the way I'm Kyle. Kyle Twischer. I'm Sonja. Nice to meet you. Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your lord and savior? What? I'm kidding. I'm atheist. Me too. Do you like cocaine? Listen, um, you're Ashley's friend, right? Ashley Jones? How d'you know Ashley? We, uh, we actually used to go out, I can't fuckin' stand her, to tell you the truth. That's not very nice. Well, you probably didn't go out with her for two years. I wouldn't say a nice thing about her if she gave me all the tea in China. What if she gave you a million bucks? Ashley wouldn't give me a million bucks. She'd make me find it. That's a good answer. Do you want your fortune read? I don't believe in that stuff. It doesn't matter what you believe. All that matters is what's true. There's no evidence it's true. Then what harm could it bring? Here, you shuffle the deck. You're using playing cards? Yeah. A little old lady from Jamaica taught me how to do it. You're not using Tarot? Tarot is evil. Now, pick three cards. Each card indicates your past, your present, and your future. Hm. This card shows that there was some bad luck in your past. Maybe an illness, or a death of a loved one? Your present. The five of clubs shows you a new friendship is awaiting you. The Joker. This could mean anything. It shows that your future is uncertain. So, tell me somethin' about yourself. There's not much to tell. C'mon, everybody has a story. Uh, what about your folks? They're both dead. Oh, shit. I'm sorry. It's fine. I got a scholarship into university. Well, I'm sorry anyway. My folks live in Jersey. Eh, but, a scholarship. Why'd you choose to go into math? I dunno. Just for the money, I guess. STEM fields are very lucrative these days. I don't see the point of looking beyond this world. Well, the philosopher Kant once wrote that we're all born with rose-tinted glasses, and that we can never take them off. So our perception of the world is limited to what we can see. But there might be more we don't know about that we could only see if we could take those glasses off. Whatever. Are you okay? I just, I dunno. Are you worried about that card? About how I told you there was a tragedy in your past and the deaths of your parents and everything? Even I thought that was kinda weird. It's just a coincidence. It's like the Prophecies of Nostradamus. Lots of people have tragedies in their past. Who cares? Well, then, what about the second card, huh? A new friendship on the horizon? Anyways, I don't see the point of looking beyond the real world. There's enough real shit to deal with. I guess. So, you wanna have sex, or what? I gotta lot of work to do tonight, maybe another time? You on your period or somethin'? Look, I don't care. I like a little blood. I'm not on my period, asshole. Well, I think you're a very beautiful woman. Would you want to go out with me sometime? Okay. But not tonight? No. All right. Well, I gotta get goin' then. It was nice to meet you, Sonja. You too, Kyle. Bye. Bye. Oh, uh, say hi to Ashley for me, would you? Okay. Thanks. Bye. I know you. I've always known you. He's going to mutilate your vagina. Was that a dream? Fuck, it didn't feel like a dream. Latin? Why would Ashley have this? What's up? Hey, um, I'm going for a walk. Do you need anything from the store? At this time of night? I just had a bad dream, and I just really need some fresh air. No, I'm fine. Are you okay? Yeah. 'course. Sonja, has anything weird happened? To you, I mean. Don't be stupid. Can I help you? I know you. I've always known you. I have something for you. So why don't you believe in the occult? I believed in it when I was younger, but, I just had so many bad experiences, like my parents dying, it just made me not believe in it. Has anything bad happened to you? Not yet. No? I think that's why I'm still okay doing it, because I haven't had anything too terrible. Sometimes I don't really believe in it, because nothing really happens, but it's kinda fun. Not even a little bit? I mean, sometimes I can feel spirits around me. Mm-hmm. Like, I'll do a spell, and I can feel, like, you know, a shift in energy, but that's really it. Like I don't really normally get anything that's too crazy. You don't feel petrified and scared after and be like crying and be like ugh? No, no, no, That's why I'm like, uh, it might not actually be real, but I like to think that it is. So what did you say this was again? It was a movie made in 1594. Sonja, that's impossible. I know, but I wanted you to check it out. I know you're into this weird occult stuff. Yeah, I mean, I can look it up in Spates Catalog, but I don't recall hearing about anything from this era, so... I know, but, it really spooks me out. Yeah, I mean, I don't know, I don't really get that impression from it. It's not really scary in any way. Hey, Danielle. Oh, hey, Morgan. Morgan, this is my friend Sonja. Sonja, this is my boyfriend Morgan. Hey. Hi. So, you wanna go grab some lunch? Sure, oh, you're studying history. Have you heard of a guy from the 1500s named Var? Might've been called Esteban De Ruiz? No. Do you wanna come with us? I have class soon, I'll call ya later. Sure. I researched the movie we saw last night. Yeah? It's just like a Creepypasta. It's like, where the sorcerer lives on in the movie, but he was a real person. There's 10 different movies of it on the internet. That's reassuring. I had a really bad nightmare about it last night. Me too. What was yours about? It was about this cassette tape. What was yours about? It was that guy from the movie pulling my intestines out. I'm scared. I, I have class in 10 minutes. I gotta go. Okay, see ya. You say a word and I will slit yer throat, ya whore! Can't do anything to me. I'm campus security. You say anything, I will cut off your head and skullfuck you! I'll see you later, Sonja. Hey, Kyle, can you come over? Okay, see ya soon. Bye. Hey, Sonja. Hey, Kyle. How are you? Is everything okay? Yeah, I just didn't want to be alone tonight. What about your roommate? She's at a study group 'til nine, and then she's gonna meet some friends after, so she won't be home until late. 'kay. You worried about something? Do you remember the other night when that security guard attacked me? Yeah, why? Do you know anything about him? Come on. Let's get a drink. His name's Elmer Greuba. Greuba? Yeah. Uh, they call him Greuba the Tuba. 'Cause he got caught, um, playing his tuba in the women's change room. You mean jacking off? Uh, yeah. Hmm. Well, couldn't you just say he was playing his trombone? Yeah, but that wouldn't rhyme. Hmm. And they let him be campus security in spite of that? Well, it was one of many rumors. I heard stuff about him eating out of the garbage, stealing panties and tampons from the dorm. One thing I did see him do was pick his nose and then eat it. Ugh. I do believe it. Listen, that night that Elmer, grabbed you, you said it wasn't the first time it happened. When did it happen before? I got raped in my senior year of high school. Oh, shit, uh, I'm sorry. Uh, are you gonna press charges against Elmer? Would anyone believe me? Hey, well, I'm a witness, right? Mmm-hmm. Can I show you something? Yeah, sure. What was that? It was a, it was a, a video me and Ashley found in the basement of a movie made in the 1500s by some sorcerer. What did he film it with, magic? You don't believe that, do you? Of course not. I'm not stupid. Well, I do know back in those days they had devices that were kinda like movie projectors. Little, uh, magic lanterns and spinning wheels with flipbooks on them. That sort of thing. I know it's just a stupid hoax. So what's the problem? I just have a funny feeling about it. It's just... It's okay. The movie was based on a religious cult that sacrificed people in the 1500s called the Varians. Have you heard of them? No, never. Look, I think you're just anxious about things. I know the anniversary of your parents' death is coming up, and you've got a lot on your plate with school and everything. Look, why don't we just go out to a fancy restaurant, then come back here and make love? Okay. So are you feeling better? Kyle, there's something else. There's something else I didn't tell you. What? I went for a walk yesterday, and I saw someone. It's like he was following me. Was it Elmer? No. I can't explain it. It's like he was there, and then he wasn't. He was very familiar. Are you sure you weren't just imagining it? I'm not crazy. Finally. Okay, so here's your salad. And, uh, here's your juicy striploin steak, which I farted on, it gives it some extra flavor. Thanks, Belinda. So who's the skank? Saw you two at the party. - You two fucking? - Excuse me? Sorry, Sonja. This is one of my money-grubbing ex girlfriends, Belinda. She's a real basket case. Just an FYI, his penis is small. Yeah, ha ha! Looks like you just talked yourself out of a tip, stupid. Enjoy your meal, asshole. That looks a little bloody, isn't it? I told you, I like a little blood. What is it? You're not still freaked out about that tape, are you? I just don't like blood. You have a phobia of it or something? Do you want to know how my parents died? Okay. Do you know who John Richard Ray was? Yeah, serial killer, right? When I was a kid, I came home one afternoon, and he killed them. He was eating pieces of their flesh, and there was blood everywhere. Wow. That's fucked up. He got the chair, didn't he? Mmm-hmm. Anyways, I ran out in time, and I lived with my aunt afterwards. She died, and I got a scholarship. I don't really know what to say to that. I mean, both my parents are Jehovah's Witnesses. They hate me for being an atheist, and my dad thinks I'm gay. You okay? Fine. I dunno. I just, I feel bad making you dredge up all that stuff about your parents. I can't imagine how hard that must have been for you. What? What? I thought I saw something. Who is this guy? Uh, he's this magician named Ghorghoulia the Magnificent. He does a lot of stuff with gore and torture. People who like horror movies are really into him. I hate horror movies. Why? I scare too easily. Ladies and gentlemen, tonight, the Randolph Carter Theater is proud to present the man who shatters the border between reality and illusion. Put your hands together for the one, the only, Ghorghoulia the Magnificent! Whoo! Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming this evening. Tonight, I will be performing my most horrific magic trick yet. To begin, I will be removing the internal organs of my lovely assistant, Elvira, including the liver, pancreas, and heart. The liver, ladies and gentlemen. The pancreas, ladies and gentlemen. How is he doing that? I don't know. The heart continues to beat, ladies and gentlemen. Sorry. No need to worry, folks. Elvira is alive and well. Wooo! Sorry for takin' you to see this, especially for our first date. I didn't expect him to do that trick. You probably think I'm a real psycho or somethin'. It's okay. You didn't know he would. Are you into stuff like gore and torture? Heh. You might say that. You want some? I think I could use a Xanax instead. I dunno. Coke always gets me jacked up for a good fuck. Kyle? Ashley! Ashley! Ashley, where are you? Ashley is with us now, Sonja. Fuck! He's going to mutilate your vagina. Mutilate your vagina. Mutilate your vagina. Mutilate your vagina. Mutilate your vagina. Mutilate your vagina. Get out of my house! I can't move! Vagina! No! Not that! This can't be happening, I don't believe this. I'm not crazy. It defies all logic. I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy, Ugh! Blood! Sonja! What's the matter? Ashley! Ashley! Thank God you're okay! Eat, vegan. Help me! Help me! Hello? Hi, I'm Sonja. Are you Poula Anastasopoulous? What do you want? Do you know anything about a movie called "1594?" Come on up. Come, have a seat. So, how'd you like the movie? What do you know about it? I normally wouldn't help out a stranger, but this is exceptional circumstances. Where did you find it? I moved into Enid Moon's old house. It was in her basement. Is Enid still alive? The realtor said she hanged herself in an asylum. Huh. She must have become one of Var's victims. You can't escape him, even in death. Do you believe that? I don't know what I believe any more, lady. Has Var started to attack you? If that is him, what is he? He was a sorcerer in the 1600s, supposedly. He could travel through time. He somehow got a camera and film from the future and filmed himself conducting that ritual, which imprinted his spirit onto the film forever. And right after the ritual, he was burned by the Inquisition. Everyone who has watched that film has ended up one of his victims. I haven't seen it personally, but I knew my copy was authentic. Which is why I believed you when you told me what was happening. He can't attack me forever. Oh, no? I put my faith in evidence. I don't believe what I cannot see. I don't believe in the supernatural. You can't escape him, even in death. Do you believe that? I don't know what I believe any more, lady. Double whiskey, please. Danielle, Hi. Hello. Do you remember me? I'm Ghorghoulia the Magnificent, the illusionist. Yeah, right. You were in my audience this evening. Got a little frightened, did you? You were pretty convincing. How did you do it? A magician never reveals his secrets. Oh. You seem a little shaken up. Are you okay? I have somebody following me. It's, it's just safer to be in a public place. Why don't you go to the police? They wouldn't believe me if I told them what happened. I wouldn't believe me. Listen. Perhaps you'd like to join us. Some friends and I are having dinner tonight. This late? Yes. It's a special occasion. I'm not in the mood. I insist. We're having a delicious meal. Please. Please. Okay, so you have the human hand. Okay, and you have the fried liver! Sonja. You need to let Var into your heart, and taste the mother's milk. Taste his milk. Get her! You sons of bitches! You bitch! Sonja, what, what is it? What's wrong? I didn't know where else to go! What do you mean? What are you saying? Var, I saw him! He's, he's real! What, the sorcerer? Yeah. Sonja, you're kidding, right? You believe in the occult stuff, don't you? Yeah, but not to the point where dead people can come back to life after five centuries. He, he attacked my friend. She just slit her own throat and then she just laughed at me! Okay, Sonja, you need to go to the hospital. You're nuts. Now you listen to me, you fuckin' bitch! You gimme some of that occult shit and you summon Var! And send him to hell! - Help me! - Sonja, you're hurting me! Okay, okay! Okay! What's goin' on? Nothing. Nothing. Heard you arguing about the occult. What's that about? She wants to do a ritual or something. What'd I say? What did I say? You don't fuck around with that Ouija board bullshit! It's fuckin' black magic and it's fuckin' evil! What did I just say? Don't fuck around with the black magic. I got it! That's right. And you do, I'll knock the fuckin' teeth outta your head. Don't give her any fuckin' ideas. Please, please help me. There is one thing we could do. Give me your hand. So this ritual is designed to summon demonic creatures. And once we summon Var, we can do another incantation and send him back into the abyss. Okay. 'kay. Give me your hands. Is that it? Yeah, that's it. I don't really believe in this stuff, Sonja. It's just for fun. Morgan! I thought I told you not to fuck around with that black magic shit! Morgan, I'm sorry! Me and Sonja were just having fun. Why don't we just go back into the party? I lied, Sonja. I know who Var is. What? I know who Esteban De Ruiz is. I know he's evil. I studied him in class. And I know when I heard you guys talkin' about him, I could not allow Danielle to release him into this world, or this house. And I can't let you either. Are you gonna kill me? I have to. No! You don't know what you've done! Var, he can't be stopped! He killed Danielle! What the fuck? What is going on here? Where are you? Where are yoU? I have one more message for you. Kyle! Oh, Kyle! Thank God you're here! Sonja, it's okay. I know about everything. I know about Var. What the fuck? Sonja, he's here to save us. He came back to save us from our eternal damnation. He's our messiah! What the fuck? Sonja, come with me. I'll help you understand. I'll help you understand everything! Get the fuck away from me! Cocaine? You! Where am I? Kyle! She's awake! Snort it! No! Snort it or we'll cut your spleen out! Ah, welcome, to my humble abode. You? Elmer! No. No! No! We've got a bit of time before everybody else gets here. But first, I thought I'd let my cousin Elmer have a little fun with you. Elmer has problems talking to women. He needs testicular relief as much as any man does Why is this happening to me? Vagina! I've already had my way with you. I thought I'd give Elmer a turn. It could be fun, dearie. Ya never know. Ha ha ha! Oh, wonderful! You still have gonorrhea! Yep. Worms too. Silence! My brothers and sisters, the Kingdom of Var awaits you. Tonight, on this date, is the sacrifice of the gatekeeper, Sonja Fitzgerald. Upon her death, Var will return from the dimension of chaos, and come to Earth, to grant us, the Varians, salvation and bliss! But, before the hour is upon us, let us indulge in this feast of this high priestess of Var. Var loves me. He is my savior. Somebody! Anybody! Eat! I, I'm a vegan. Brothers and sisters! The hour is upon us. Let us begin the sacrifice. What the fuck? What the fuck? I can't, control myself. He took my eyes! What do you want from me? Ashley? The spell you cast. It brought you to this dimension, the universe of Gamoa. What are you talking about? It's not possible. It can't be real. It's as real as anything, Sonja. This is a terror universe. Everything that exists here was formed from the fears which leak out of your subconscious mind. Which, in turn, come from a vast abyss of a sub-universe. But it's all real, and Var is a part of that. He entered our world through the movie that you watched. No, no, it's not possible. It's real. Sonja, I want to show you something. He's yours now, Sonja. You can do whatever you want with him. I brought him into this dimension, and now his fears are being siphoned into it. I'm insane, this, this isn't real. This isn't real! You're not insane. This, this dimension is all real. Here, I need you to read another spell to send us home. And send Var into the abyss. No, no, Sonja, it'll send you to Hell! Sonja, you believe him? Don't forget everything he's done to you. He's a fucking monster and you know it. Send him to Hell where he belongs. I thought this was Hell. There are many Hells, Sonja I can't, I can't believe it. How can you say that after everything you've seen? I'm insane. I'm insane, I have to be! Okay, I'll try it. No, no, Sonja! It'll take you to Hell! I don't know if I believe it, but I'll try it. Sonja, read this spell. Welcome to my humble abode. I told you the spell would send you to Hell, Sonja. Soon you will join them. They thought pandering to me would grant them an eternity in Paradise. But it incensed me, granted them an eternity of torture. Fuck you! Why are you doing this to me? Because I love you, Sonja. This isn't love! I don't know what this is! Diabolum in abyss. Diabolum in abyss. Send the Devil to the abyss. The spells worked before, I'll send you to the abyss. You're the Devil. You're the Devil! Thank you for releasing me, Sonja. You shall be my queen. Never, you son of a bitch. You'll come around. We will rule the world together. Billions will be our slaves. What happened to Ashley? She will be tortured in Hell for all eternity. Don't you care about people's feelings? Human beings are insects to me, Sonja. I have become God. You're just a cold-hearted bitch. I hate you. I hate you! I'm gonna kill you, mother fucker! Diabolum in... So you think you can stop me? You don't even believe in the occult. I know you don't. You're just crazy, right? You have to believe in it to make it work. You don't have to believe it in Gammor, but you have to believe it here on Earth. I've seen it work. I believe it. I believe, I have to believe. Diabolum in... No! Diabolum in Abyssum! No! It's not over, Sonja. What are you talking about? How stupid do you think Var is? You think he just gave you those spells and let you destroy him? Did you just believe it would send him to Hell? Beliefs are worthless! Only knowledge matters, and you didn't know what it would do. Var promised me eternal life if I brought him to you. I've lived forever and ever, over and over again, for all eternity, and will continue to do so. Ashley, what are you talking about? The second incantation. This will never end. was meant to trap you in an infinite time warp. You spoke it aloud when you read it off the tape. The last incantation which you thought destroyed Var was just an illusion to give you false hope. He feeds off your hope. And your pain. It amuses him. You're lying to me, you bitch! No, Sonja. This has all happened before. Over and over again. And will continue happening over and over again forever. This will never end. No! It's all flooding back now, isn't it? Don't worry, you won't remember any of it in a minute. That photographic memory of yours won't do you any good now. No! How are you? Hey, Sonja. Can I come in? Uh, okay. Are you okay? Uh, yeah, I just had deja vu.
