TECHNICAL SERGEANT? T.S. YES, T.S. GARP. THAT'S MY BABY'S NAME. IF I FIND HIM, I'LL KILL HIM. HE'S DEAD ALREADY. I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU BOTHERED TO GET MARRIED? MARRIED? SHE NEVER EVEN MET HIM. I DIDN'T WANT MARRIAGE. I WANTED A BABY. BUT A WEDDING RING... I DIDN'T NEED HIS RING. I NEEDED HIS SPERM. DON'T... DON'T YOU DARE SAY SPERM IN THIS HOUSE. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO GET A JOB. I'M A TRAINED NURSE. I PLAN TO CONTINUE MY WORK. JENNY! JENNY! IN THE WAR, WHICH SIDE WAS HE ON? WAS HE ON OUR SIDE, AT LEAST? HE WASN'T ON ANY SIDE. HE WAS ON HIS BACK IN THE HOSPITAL. ONE NIGHT WHEN HE HAD HIS USUAL ERECTION, I GOT ON TOP OF HIM AND INSERTED IT IN ME. HE EJACULATED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. NOW I HAVE A WONDERFUL BABY! I CAN'T HEAR A DAMN THING. WHERE'D SHE GO? WHERE THE... OH, MY GOD! WHAT A BOD. WHAT A BOD. THIS, GENTLEMEN, IS A BOD. I WISH I WAS A GIRL. I'D TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES AND STAND IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR, LOOKING FOR HOURS. THE ALL-AMERICAN BOD.

OF COURSE YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. COME ON IN HERE. WELL, I ZIPPED IT UP TOO FAST, AND IT GOT CAUGHT. I CAN SEE THAT. WE'LL JUST HAVE TO UNZIP YOU. I TRIED THAT ALREADY, BUT IT HURTS. IT'S EITHER THAT OR AMPUTATE. YOU CAN'T PARADE AROUND LIKE A SAVAGE FROM BORNEO. AAH! IT'S ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON. I'LL PUT SOMETHING ON IT. I'LL GET YOU FOR THIS, PRITCHARD. JEFFREY?

WELL, GOOD NIGHT, THEN, BOSWORTH. SLEEP WELL. MY FATHER WAS A FLIER. I TOLD YOU, HE WAS A TAIL GUNNER IN A PLANE. IF HE WAS IN A PLANE, HE WAS A FLIER. WAS HE REAL BIG? I DON'T KNOW. I NEVER SAW HIM STANDING UP. WHY NOT? I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT SOMEDAY. THIS IS ONE COURSE YOU WON'T BE TAKING. THE TEXT IS DULL, AND STEWART PERCY IS EVEN DULLER. I NEARLY FELL ASLEEP IN HIS CLASS TODAY. MAYBE HE DIDN'T DIE. WHO? MY FATHER. HE SURE DID. DEAD AND GONE. MYTHOLOGY. I'LL CHECK OUT THIS CLASS FOR YOU NEXT WEEK. THE LONG RANGER DIED. IT'S LONE RANGER, NOT LONG. HE DIED. I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT. BUT HE REALLY DIDN'T. EVERYBODY THOUGHT SO, BUT HE DIDN'T. MAYBE MY FATHER DIDN'T REALLY DIE, EITHER. NOT REALLY. I'M A NURSE. I KNOW. HE DIED. WILL I EVER FLY LIKE DADDY? I DON'T KNOW. I REMEMBER FLYING. WHEN YOU WERE BORN, I WAS SO HAPPY, I THREW YOU UP AND DOWN. I REMEMBER. YOU WERE TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER. I WENT FLYING WITH DADDY LAST WEEK. ARE YOU GOING TO SLEEP, OR ARE YOU GOING TO THINK YOUR WEIRD THOUGHTS? I'LL THINK WEIRD THOUGHTS FOR A WHILE. ALL RIGHT. FINE. GOOD NIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING. IF I'M STILL HERE. YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T REALLY NEED A FATHER. ALL THE OTHER KIDS HAVE ONE. IF ALL THE OTHER KIDS HAD TRENCH MOUTH, WOULD YOU WANT THAT, TOO?

YOU SURE LIKE TROUBLE, DON'T YOU? THANK GOD I CAUGHT HIM. YES. JUST IN TIME. WHAT WAS HE DOING UP THERE? PRETENDING TO BE HIS DEAD FATHER. I WANTED TO BE A FATHER MYSELF, BUT I NEVER GOT MARRIED. NEITHER DID I. HMM? I ALWAYS WANTED A CHILD. IF I COULD'VE HAD ONE BY MYSELF, I WOULD'VE. BUT GOD OR NATURE OR WHATEVER... WELL, YOU NEED A MAN. YOU KNOW MEN... FULL OF LUST. I CAN TALK TO YOU. YOU'RE PAST ALL THAT. WHAT? YOU'RE NOT WELL ENOUGH TO WALK. THAT'S A VERY NASTY BUMP. ANYWAY... THE WAR WAS ON. I WAS A NURSE. ONE DAY, THEY BROUGHT IN A TAIL GUNNER WHO'D BEEN WOUNDED BY ANTIAIRCRAFT IN A RAID OVER GERMANY. A SPLINTER OF STEEL LODGED IN HIS BRAIN. ALL HE COULD SAY WAS HIS NAME... GARP. FOR MEDICAL REASONS I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND, HE ALSO HAD A CONSTANT ERECTION, AND HE DETERIORATED STEADILY, UNTIL ONE DAY, ALL HE COULD SAY WAS PART OF HIS NAME... ARP. IT WAS THEN I KNEW HE WOULDN'T LAST MUCH LONGER. HIS ERECTIONS CONTINUED HOWEVER, QUITE UNABATED. I SEE. I'LL JUST BE GOING. NOT YET. NO, NOT YET. YOU'D BETTER REST. ANYWAY... WHERE WAS I? HE KEPT HAVING ERECTIONS. THANK YOU. HE WAS DYING. I WANTED A CHILD. IT SEEMED A GOOD WAY TO HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE BOTHER OF A HUSBAND. SO ONE NIGHT, WHEN THE WOUNDED AND MAIMED WERE ALL ASLEEP, I WENT TO HIM. HE WAS ASLEEP, BUT HIS ERECTION WAS THERE AS ALWAYS. I REMOVED MY UNDERGARMENTS AND CLIMBED ON TOP OF HIM. HE WOKE UP THEN, SAID THE ONLY WORD OTHER THAN HIS NAME I'D EVER HEARD HIM UTTER. HE SAID, "GOOD." IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG. ONCE WAS ALL THAT WAS NEEDED. YOU RAPED HIM. YOU RAPED A DYING MAN. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? NO. UH, YES. I HAVE TO GET HOME NOW. YOU'VE BEEN VERY KIND. I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING... GOOD NIGHT. AND THEN HE DIED. HE DID DIE. REALLY? REALLY. WILL YOU THROW ME IN THE AIR LIKE YOU USED TO? YOU'RE TOO BIG FOR THAT NOW. MAY THE LORD'S LIGHT SHINE UPON YOU AND GIVE YOU PEACE. AMEN. NOW YOU DON'T HAVE A FATHER, EITHER. I KNOW. EVERYBODY DIES. MY PARENTS DIED. YOUR FATHER DIED. EVERYBODY DIES. I'M GOING TO DIE, TOO. SO WILL YOU. THE THING IS... TO HAVE A LIFE BEFORE WE DIE. IT CAN BE A REAL ADVENTURE HAVING A LIFE. GARP! CAREFUL OF THE UNDERTOW! THE UNDERTOW! BE CAREFUL OF THE UNDERTOW! HOWDY DO! HI. HELLO AGAIN. I HOPE I'M NOT DISTURBING YOU RUNNING UP AND DOWN HERE. NOPE. IT'S DISTRACTING, ISN'T IT?

WELL, GARP WASN'T REALLY CONCENTRATING THE FIRST PERIOD. IT WAS LUST. BEG YOUR PARDON? LUST. MR. HOLM, YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER. I HAVE A SON. HE'S A FINE BOY. HE'S ALSO FULL OF LUST. I CAN SPOT IT A MILE AWAY. HE'S LUSTING AFTER YOUR DAUGHTER. I WOULDN'T WORRY. HELEN CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF. AFTER ALL, IT'S ONLY NATURAL. DISEASES ARE NATURAL, TOO. DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO GIVE IN TO THEM. KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR DAUGHTER. HEH HEH. HEH HEH. HELLO, GARP? CUSHIE? GARP! SO, WHAT BRINGS YOU HOME? I'M VISITING. I'M STUCK AT THIS ALL-GIRLS SCHOOL. I THOUGHT I'D SEE HOW THE BOYS ARE DOING. HOW ARE YOU? I HAVE THIS TERRIBLE HEADACHE. I'LL SEE YOU. TAKE CARE. HI. HI. AM I DISTURBING YOU? I THINK YOU LIKE TO DISTURB ME. YOU SURE READ A LOT. I'VE ALWAYS READ A LOT. ME, TOO. YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN YOUR EYES, THOUGH. THEY'RE ALREADY RUINED. OH. ULYSSES. YOU GOING TO BE A WRITER? NO CHANCE. I'M GOING TO BE A READER. MAYBE YOU'LL MARRY A WRITER. IF I MARRY ANYBODY, IT'LL BE A WRITER, BUT I DOUBT I'LL MARRY ANYBODY. YOU'RE CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO MARRY A WRESTLER. YOU CAN BE VERY SURE OF THAT, UNLESS IT'S A WRESTLER WHO'S ALSO A WRITER. BUT A WRITER FIRST AND FOREMOST? YEAH. A REAL WRITER. LIKE JOYCE? MAYBE. BUT HE NEVER MADE ANY MONEY. HE WORKED AS A CLERK TO SUPPORT HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE. YOU'VE READ HIM? DID YOU KNOW HE HAD A BEAUTIFUL TENOR VOICE? NO, I DIDN'T. HE WAS 21 WHEN HE ENTERED THE FEIS CEOIL IN DUBLIN. IT'S A GAELIC MUSICAL COMPETITION. HE WAS RUNNER-UP IN THE TENOR CATEGORY. KNOW WHO THE WINNER WAS? JOHN McCORMACK. REALLY? DO YOU ALWAYS WEAR A SWEAT SUIT? DON'T YOU LIKE IT? I WAS JUST IMAGINING WHAT YOU'RE LIKE WITHOUT IT... I MEAN, IN A DRESS. I SPEND A LOT OF TIME IMAGINING THINGS. IT'S PART OF MY TRAINING AS A WRITER. ALL REAL WRITERS IMAGINE. GOOD NIGHT, GARP. OH, MY GOD. GARP, YOU'VE NO RIGHT TO WRITE THIS. IF YOU'RE GOING TO WRITE ABOUT MY PERSONAL LIFE, WAIT TILL I'M DEAD. WHILE I'M ALIVE, THE SUBJECT BELONGS TO ME. I MIGHT WANT TO WRITE ABOUT MYSELF.

WHAT IS IT ABOUT HER YOU WANT? I DON'T MEAN JUST HER SEX PARTS. IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S SATISFYING? WELL, IT'S... WELL, AHEM, WELL, IT'S A COMBINATION. HOW DO YOU FEEL TO BE WANTED IN THAT WAY? DOES IT DEGRADE YOU TO HAVE MY SON WANT YOU, OR DO YOU THINK IT ONLY DEGRADES HIM? I DON'T KNOW. DO YOU WANT HER? DO YOU WANT HER LIKE YOU WANT HELEN? IS IT THE SAME KIND OF WANT? YOU REALLY WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH HER? WELL, DO YOU? YES. OF COURSE I DO. ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME IF YOUR MOTHER WANTS TO BUY ME FOR YOU, BUT SHE CAN'T COME ALONG. OH, NO... I WON'T HAVE HER WATCH US. I'M STILL CATHOLIC, BELIEVE IT OR NOT. I DON'T INTEND TO WATCH. I'VE HEARD QUITE ENOUGH. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME. YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT OR YOU HAVE TO DO, I GUESS. HERE. DON'T GIVE ME MONEY HERE! WHY NOT? 'CAUSE IT'S ILLEGAL, MOM. WHY? BECAUSE IT IS, THAT'S WHY. THAT'S SILLY. IT'S HER BODY. WHY SHOULDN'T SHE USE IT THE WAY SHE WANTS TO? HERE. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. GOOD NIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOUR MOTHER'S WEIRD. YOU COULD SAY THAT. MOM? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WRITING. ABOUT WHAT? NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. JUST LAY OFF ME, WILL YOU? YOU'VE BEEN HAMMERING AT ME SINCE WE GOT ON THE GODDAMN PLANE. WE SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN CHICAGO. OH, RACHEL... DON'T RACHEL ME, STEPHEN. GET YOUR MATTRESSES! PUT MATTRESSES UNDER HIM! CUSHION HIS FALL! GO! JUMP! GO AHEAD AND JUMP! OH, MY GOD! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! RACHEL? STEPHEN! STEPHEN! REMEMBER CHICAGO? DO YOU? DO YOU REMEMBER THESE, RACHEL? DO YOU? I DON'T WANT THEM ANYMORE. ♪ THERE WILL BE OTHER SONGS TO SING ♪ ♪ ANOTHER FALL, ANOTHER SPRING ♪ COME DOWN, STEPHEN. ♪ BUT THERE WILL NEVER ♪ AAH! AAH! WATCH OUT! AAH! AAH! WELL? IT'S, UH... A BIT THIN. YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT QUANTITY THAT COUNTS. THANK GOD FOR THAT. THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. THAT'S NOT VERY ARTISTIC, THOUGH. WELL, I'M NOT AN ARTIST. I'M A NURSE. IT'S TIME I GOT BACK TO IT. WELL, I WANT TO BE AN ARTIST. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU THOUGHT. I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND IT. IT'S VERY SIMPLE. HE DOES WONDERS WHEN HE'S WEARING HIS MAGIC GLOVES. IF HIS WIFE IS SAD, HE TOUCHES HER WITH HIS GLOVES, AND SHE'S HAPPY. IF HIS CHILDREN ARE CRYING, HE JUST TOUCHES THEM, AND THEY SMILE. BUT HE CAN'T FEEL THEM. HE YEARNS TO FEEL. HE CAN EVEN HOLD OFF DEATH WITH HIS GLOVES, BUT HE CAN'T FEEL LIFE. SO HE TAKES OFF THE GLOVES, AND HE DIES, BUT HE FINALLY FEELS LIFE AS HE'S FLYING INTO THE ARMS OF DEATH. I LIKE THAT. IF THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS, I LIKE IT. WELL, LET ME SEE YOURS. NO. I'VE GOT TO GO. THAT'S NOT FAIR. I SHOWED YOU MINE, YOU SHOW ME YOURS. YOU THINK YOU'RE PLAYING DOCTOR'S OFFICE WITH CUSHIE? I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT. WITH WHO? WHOM. WITH WHOM WAS YOUR APPOINTMENT, MOTHER? WITH HIM. HE'S A PUBLISHER. HE LOOKS LIKE A NICE MAN. I'LL LET HIM PUBLISH MY BOOK. LET HIM? WHY NOT? BRING THAT ALONG, WILL YOU? WE CAN RETURN IT. COME ALONG. "IN THIS DIRTY-MINDED WORLD, "YOU ARE EITHER SOMEBODY'S WIFE OR SOMEBODY'S WHORE OR FAST ON YOUR WAY TO BECOMING ONE OR THE OTHER." I THINK SO. DON'T YOU? TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I'VE NEVER GIVEN THE MATTER MUCH THOUGHT, BUT... GARP! IS THAT RIGHT... GARP? THAT'S RIGHT. GARP. MOM, YOU DIDN'T WRITE ABOUT ME, DID YOU? I WROTE ABOUT MY LIFE. YOU'RE A PART OF IT. BUT YOU SAID WHEN I WANTED TO WRITE ABOUT YOUR LIFE... MY SON'S ALSO A WRITER. SHORT STORIES. "SEXUAL SUSPECT?" WELL, I WANTED A JOB, AND I WANTED TO LIVE ALONE. THAT MADE ME A SEXUAL SUSPECT. I WANTED A BABY, BUT DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE MY LIFE TO HAVE ONE. THAT ALSO MADE ME A SEXUAL SUSPECT. OH. I WANTED TO EXPRESS AN INNER LONGING... WELL, I'LL CALL YOU. MOM, THAT WASN'T FAIR. YOU SAID I COULDN'T WRITE ABOUT YOU. OH, MY GOD. GO AWAY. WELL? IT'S... SO SAD. REALLY? SO SAD! OH, THAT'S GREAT. I MEAN, THANK YOU. OH-HO! IT'S THE SADDEST STORY I HAVE EVER READ. HA! YEOW! HA! THAT'S WONDERFUL! OH, I'M SO HAPPY! I'M SO SAD! HELEN, DO YOU KNOW THIS WILL BE PUBLISHED IN THE REVIEW? AND MOM'S PUBLISHER SAID HE'LL PUBLISH MY FIRST NOVEL, TOO. DO YOU THINK I'LL BE A REAL WRITER? I DO. OH, I DO! OH, HEH HEH. OH... AND YOU SAID THAT YOU'D ONLY MARRY A REAL WRITER. I DID. AND I DO. I DO, TOO. IT'S SICKENING. EVERY BOOKSTORE IN NEW YORK LOOKS LIKE THIS. EVERY BOOKSTORE IN THE U.S. I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT LUST? SHE NEVER FELT IT, NOT ONCE. SOME AUTHORITY SHE IS. IT'S LIKE LISTENING TO PLANTS DISCUSS THE MOTIVES OF MAMMALS. IT'S TIMING. TIMING? IN WRITING, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE WRITING. IN WRITING, IT'S WRITING. IN PUBLISHING, IT'S TIMING. I'M STUNNED. IT UPSETS PEOPLE. I'M GETTING HATE MAIL JUST FOR PUBLISHING IT. IT'S DANGEROUS STUFF, AND DANGEROUS STUFF SELLS. IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, WE HAVE ALL BEEN SUSPECT ALL OF OUR LIVES. THANK YOU. WE HAVE BEEN SUSPECT AS THE WEAKER SEX. YEAH! YEAH! WHEN WE SHOWED STRENGTH, WE WERE SUSPECT AS NOT BEING WEAK ENOUGH. WHEN WE SHOWED INTELLIGENCE, WE WERE SUSPECT OF COVERING UP SOME DEFECT IN OUR FEMININITY WITH OUR BRAINS. YEAH! YEAH! WHAT REALLY GETS MY GOAT IS THAT SHE WROTE ABOUT ME. I AM KNOWN AS THE BASTARD SON OF JENNY FIELDS. HELLO. HOW NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. HOW YOU DOING? VERY WELL, THANK YOU. YEAH? THANKS SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING. AW, WHAT THE HELL. AM I IN IT? IN A WAY. YEAH? I'LL READ IT. SHE IS GOING TO BE VERY, VERY RICH AND VERY, VERY FAMOUS. I GET THE PICTURE. I DON'T THINK YOU DO. YOU'RE A WONDERFUL WRITER, GARP. YOUR NOVEL'S A GOOD FIRST NOVEL. I'M PROUD TO PUBLISH IT. BUT YOUR MOTHER HAS WRITTEN A POLITICAL MANIFESTO. SHE'S A CULT, NOT A WRITER. HI. COULD YOU WRITE A LITTLE SOMETHING IN THERE? IT'S FOR FRANK, MY HUSBAND. "DEAR FRANK, THE KIDS ARE IN THE SCHOOL, "THE DOG IS IN THE YARD, "AND I AM GONE, GONE, GONE. LOVE, RUTH." I THINK YOU BETTER WRITE THAT. THANK YOU. I WILL. WE'RE NEITHER LITTLE NOR WEAK, BUT A FORCE TO BE DEALT WITH! YEAH! THE WOMEN OF AMERICA, HUNGRY FOR A HEROINE, HAVE AT LAST FOUND ONE IN JENNY FIELDS! THE MEN OF AMERICA WILL SOON FIND OUT WHAT THAT MEANS. MOM! MOM! I'M ALL RIGHT, DARLING! WE DON'T USUALLY FIND HOMES QUITE THIS LOVELY IN THIS QUIET OF A LOCATION. IS THIS NICE? ISN'T THIS A BEAUTIFUL STREET? AND THE LANDSCAPING... THEY'VE DONE LOVELY THINGS HERE WITH THE LAWN. IT'S A LOVELY PLACE. LOVELY. JUST THE TICKET FOR YOUNG MARRIEDS. AND MY FIRM WILL EVEN FINANCE THE MORTGAGE. MY MOTHER'S PAYING FOR IT. SHE'S BECOME A FIRM THESE DAYS. OH. WHAT DO YOU THINK, HELEN? IS IT A HOME? UH... IT'S CLOSE TO THE COLLEGE WHERE I'LL BE TEACHING. AND CLOSE TO THE SUPERMARKET WHERE I'LL BE SHOPPING. HA HA! JUST LIKE OUR HOUSE. I WORK. MY HUSBAND PUTTERS AROUND THE HOUSE. MY HUSBAND DOESN'T PUTTER. HE'S A WRITER. HIS NOVEL WAS JUST PUBLISHED... PROCRASTINATION BY T.S. GARP? T.S. GARP? NOT THE BASTARD SON OF JENNY FIELDS! OH, I LOVED YOUR MOTHER'S BOOK! LOVED IT! OH! I KEEP BUYING THEM, AND MY HUSBAND KEEPS BURNING THEM. HA HA! HA HA. HA HA! OH! AND YOU WRITE, TOO. ISN'T THAT NICE? YOU MUST BE SO PROUD OF YOUR MOTHER. OH, I'M VERY, VERY PROUD OF MOM. YOU FOLKS ALL RIGHT DOWN THERE? YEAH, OK. WE'RE ALL RIGHT. BUT ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? OH, I'M FINE. MIND IF I USE YOUR PHONE? SURE, IF YOU CAN FIND IT. THANKS A LOT. WE'LL TAKE THE HOUSE. GARP...

JENNY! JENNY! JENNY! JENNY! JENNY! JENNY! JENNY! JENNY! JENNY! I AM JENNY FIELDS AND... IT SEEMS MOST OF YOU KNOW WHO I AM. I ONLY WISH THAT... GET OUT OF THE WAY! HELP ME GET HER INTO THE CAR! HELLO? YES. YES, IT IS. OH, GOD! UH, YES. YES, HE IS. I'LL GET HIM. GARP. OH, GARP. I TRIED TO LOOK AFTER HER. I DID. I KEPT WARNING HER TO STAY AWAY FROM CROWDS. IT'S HARD TO PROTECT HER IN A CROWD. I HATED CROWDS. I KEPT WARNING HER. I DID. IF I'D SEEN THE MAN WITH THE GUN, IF I'D ONLY SEEN HIM A SECOND, JUST A SPLIT SECOND SOONER, I COULD HAVE BLOCKED THE SHOT. I WOULD HAVE DONE IT. I KNOW. I LOVED HER SO. SHE SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME ONCE, BUT I THOUGHT SHE WAS A FINE WOMAN. I SAVED HER BOY'S LIFE. REALLY? YEP. CAUGHT HIM WHEN HE FELL OFF THE ROOF. JUST PLAIN CAUGHT HIM. DEATH'S LIKE THAT. IT JUST PLAIN CATCHES YOU. HOW'S THE BASKETBALL TEAM, COACH? I'M A WRESTLING COACH. CHANGED JOBS, EH? NO. I'M RETIRING. DON'T SAY THAT. YOU'VE GOT A LONG LIFE AHEAD. NO. THIS IS THE LAST YEAR THAT I'LL BE COACHING. I'M OFF TO FLORIDA. OH. GARP WANTS TO TAKE OVER. TAKE OVER WHAT? COACHING. WHAT DO YOU COACH? IT'S BEING HELD AT 5:00 TOMORROW IN NEW YORK, BUT I'M AFRAID YOU CAN'T GO. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN? I'M HER SON! IT'S JUST FOR WOMEN. IT'S GOING TO BE THE FIRST FEMINIST MEMORIAL FUNERAL, AND THEY AREN'T GOING TO ALLOW ANY MEN. A MAN KILLED HER. THEY'RE VERY UPSET. I'M UPSET. SHE'S MY MOTHER! I WARNED YOU ABOUT YOUR BOOK. THE ELLEN JAMESIANS ARE SENDING THREATENING LETTERS TO ME. ME, TOO. SO WHAT? THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH VIOLENCE. THEY'RE FURIOUS AT YOU. I KNOW THESE WOMEN. IF A MAN SHOWS UP... A MAN IS SHOWING UP! YOU WANT TO MAKE TROUBLE, DON'T YOU? NO. NO, I DON'T. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I WANT. I WANT MY MOTHER ALIVE AGAIN. AND SINCE I CAN'T HAVE THAT AND SINCE I MISS HER TERRIBLY, I WANT TO BE AROUND AS MANY PEOPLE WHO FEEL THE SAME WAY AS I DO. I'M GOING TO MOURN HER DEATH ALONE FOREVER. BUT RIGHT NOW, I WANT TO SHARE IT WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS I CAN. THERE WAS A VOICE IN THE LAND, BUT NOW THAT VOICE HAS BEEN SILENCED BY A MADMAN'S BULLET. JENNY'S VOICE HAS BEEN SILENCED... BUT HER WORDS HAVE BEEN PASSED ON TO EACH ONE OF US, AND WE NOW CAN SPEAK FOR OURSELVES BECAUSE SHE TAUGHT US HOW. I GRIEVE, NOT BECAUSE I'M AFRAID WE WON'T BE ABLE TO CONTINUE. WE WILL CONTINUE. I GRIEVE BECAUSE I LOVED HER. BECAUSE WE ALL LOVED HER. SHE WAS OUR MOTHER. AND THEREFORE, WE ARE NOW ORPHANS. SHE WAS OUR HOME, AND NOW WE ARE HOMELESS. ARP! I HAD MORE TO SAY... ARP! POOH! ARP! A MAN! I'VE GOT A RIGHT TO STAY! EVERYONE, PLEASE SIT DOWN. PLEASE! SILENCE, PLEASE. SILENCE IN THE HOUSE. WAIT, UH... OH. I KNOW. IT'S MY BOOK. I REALLY DON'T... OH, YOU'RE AN ELLEN JAMESIAN. THANK GOD. YOU'RE ELLEN... YOU'RE ELLEN JAMES? I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU. WAIT! NO POINT IN TAKING DONALDSON'S CLASS. THAT'S A REAL BORE. WHAT SHALL I TAKE? I'M NOT SURE. WHAT THE HELL IS GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT STUDIES? I'LL HAVE TO SIT IN ON THAT ONE AND LET YOU KNOW. THAT MUST BE THE BABYSITTER. I'LL GET IT. HI, MRS. GARP. HI, TIMMY. COME ON IN. HI, JENNY. OH, TIMMY.

I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO THE MOVIE. WHERE ARE WE GOING? I SEE. WE'RE GOING TO STAY HERE AND LOOK AT THE KIDS. THIS IS SOME DATE. DO YOU MISS WRITING? NO. NOT AT ALL. IF I DO, I'LL START AGAIN. KNOW WHAT I REALLY LOVE THOUGH? THINKING ABOUT EVERYTHING. HOW WE MET. ALL OF THAT. WE CAN'T LIVE IN THE PAST. I'M NOT, BUT I CAN LIVE IN THE PRESENT AND THINK ABOUT THE PAST. YOU DO THAT WHEN YOU'RE OLD AND GRAY. THE HELL WITH THAT. WHEN I'M OLD AND GRAY, I WON'T REMEMBER MY PAST. YOU GOT TO BE YOUNG WHEN YOU DO IT. IT'S REALLY NICE, YOU KNOW? TO LOOK BACK AND SEE THE ARC OF YOUR LIFE, HOW IT'S ALL CONNECTED. HOW YOU GOT FROM THERE TO HERE. TO SEE THE LINE, YOU KNOW? MM-HMM. IT REALLY HAS BEEN AN ADVENTURE. I'M GOING TO START TEACHING AGAIN. I'M GOING TO TAKE UP HANG GLIDING. THIS IS WHAT YOU HAD IN MIND ALL ALONG. AND I BET I KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO LATER ON. WE'LL GO LOOK AT THE KIDS WHEN THEY'RE ASLEEP.
