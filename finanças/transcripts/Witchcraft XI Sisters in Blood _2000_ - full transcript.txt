(dramatic music) (eerie electronic music) (gentle music) - What was that? - Oh just the morning mail. - Oh. Let me get it for you, my love. - Thank you, my love. Thank you. Oh, my little sister's play. She's gonna be one of the witches in Macbeth. What's this? - Everything okay? - Yeah, she just wants to borrow one of grandma's old dresses. I think I've got it in my hope chest. - You gonna run it up to her? - Yeah, I guess so. Hey, you've never met my little sister, have you? - No. - Well why don't you come along? I mean, you know, if you don't have anything to do, Mr. Lawyer. - Well I got a couple of clients to deal with this morning but I can meet you here at noon. - Okay, sounds good. - Okay. (ominous music) (laughing) - Marie. - Hey Colleen. Fancy meeting you here. - Ah, I see you're heading the same way. - I could be. - [Witches] Double, double, toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble. - [Witch] Filet of a fenny snake. In the cauldron, boil and bake. Eye of newt and toe of frog. - Stop, stop. I can't take it any longer. What is this, a high school Halloween skit? - What do you mean? - In the cauldron, boil and bake, I mean I expected you to say and your little dog two at any second. - Oh, Mr. Ramsden I'm so sure. (chuckles) - I sense nothing internal, nothing real from either of you two. Now Keri has grace, passion and power and she makes me believe in the magic. But you two, I... You need to work much harder. - I've always been interested in the black arts. I've studied it all my life, that's the difference. - Yes, now how can the senses remember what you don't experience, that is impossible. - Well we could go to the library or something. - I said experience, not research. - Well how are we supposed to get that? We go up in like two weeks? - I have an idea, there's this ritual I was gonna perform tonight, maybe you two could help me out with it. - What kind of ritual? - A ritual to raise the Sinobia sisters from the dead. - The who sisters? - Crazy old Sister Seraphina is always muttering about the three sisters, right? That's the Sinobia sisters. The way she tells it, they were witches who lived 300 years ago, devout Satanists. They supposedly built this gateway to hell, a portal through which the demon Abaddon could enter the world. - Who is this Abaddon? - He's Satan's most trusted soldier. - More precisely, he's Satan's general. - I got this crap beat into me all my life. My parents even believed that the Apocalypse was around the corner. - It is. - Oh please, I came here to get away from all that stuff. - Anyhow, according to the story, Abaddon would come first, as the vanguard to Satan's army. Once he crossed through the gateway, Abaddon would go about creating a piece of hell right here on Earth. An unholy estate, a place for Satan to command from during the coming Apocalypse. But before the sisters could open the gate, the church elders hunted them down and killed them all. - So the good guys won, so what's the problem? - Maybe they didn't. Before they died, the sisters vowed to come back from the dead and finish opening the gate. - Ooh, I'm scared. - You know, there's one thing I don't get. What's the ritual? - I have an old spell in one of my books to resurrect dark spirits. I thought we might try it out over the three sisters' graves, just for fun. - Fun? - Yeah, they're buried right outside the church yard grounds, in unsanctified soil. - You mean that the gateway to hell is right here? - On the grounds someplace, yes. - (laughs) I think that's marvelous. Unhallowed grounds, unhallowed graves, cemetery yet night raising the spirits, dire consequences if you succeed, but you do it anyway. It's perfect. - I, I don't know, Mr. Ramsden. - It does sound kind of creepy. - Come on, nothing's gonna happen, it's a fairy tale of course, but you're gonna come away with a real taste of the atmosphere and the aura of black magic. - What do you think, ladies, midnight, the graveyard? - I will if you will. - It's nothing to me, I don't even believe in God, let alone Abaddon. - It's agreed then, (laughs) marvelous, it's gonna be exciting. (knocking on door) Come in. Right on time. - Mm-hm. - You're my best student. - Let me show you how good. - Ready to bond with me? Enter the hidden circle? - Yes, yes. - Do you throw off all your other beliefs and promise to bow to Satan as your Lord and Master? - I do, I do. I am your slave, Lord Satan, let me know your dark powers. (eerie electronic music) - How's the play going? - I don't know. The director's very demanding. He's brilliant and all but I just don't think I meet his standards. - [Bruce] I know you'll do great. - Yeah, you're sweet. - Whatever it takes, you're gonna make it. In two years you'll graduate, get out of that school, move in here, I make enough for both of us and you can go on auditions day and night if you want. As long as it takes to get your break. - I couldn't let you do that. I have to chip in too. - No, I make enough for both of us, seriously. Let me take care of you. My ex-wife refused to let me take care of her. It drove us apart, I have things to give. She never understood that. - If I ever wake up from this dream, would you hit the snooze button please? (chuckles) (ominous music) - This is cheery. - Come on, Marie, take this seriously. - I'm serious. - The edge of the cemetery, right over here. This is where the sisters are. Their grave is only marked by one black stone, no epitaph. - How do you know all of this? - Pre-college records in the archives. Talking to the right people, checking around. - You're really serious about this stuff. - Yes, Colleen, I am, now focus. - We're sorry. (laughing) - Hey, I'm older than this guy. I'm older than you, punk ass (shouts). - [Man] Dude, you are fucking odd. - [Man] Yeah, so? - Shh, shh, look, look! (speaks foreign language) - [Man] This is too fucking awesome. - No way! - Shh! (women chanting in foreign language) - Arise! - You will all be damned! - No! - What the? - Go, get her, go get her. (laughing) - Marie! Fuckers! (laughing) - What a vision, beautiful nymphs all dancing among the graves. - Getting rigor mortis in my pants just thinking about it. (laughing) - Look, I didn't mean to, hey, are you okay? She's still breathing. (tense music) (laughing) - Ow, would you fucking slow it down! - Hey, now is that a way for a lady to talk? - Fucking eh, now slow it down. - Okay, okay. Nice wet spot you got in your skirt there, Lutz. - [Lutz] Just keep your eyes on the road. - You know you take all the fun out of being a cop, you know that? (phone rings) - Detective Lutz. Yeah? Got it. - What's that? - It's a dead body found at the graveyard. At St. Sebastian. - On it. - Ow, would you slow it down! Boys. - I'm Detective Gardner, this is Detective Lutz. - Hi. - Hey. - I understand you boys found the body. - Yeah, I mean, yes ma'am. We were out here last night, the three of us. - Drinking? - [Man] We took a few brewskis, you know. - Hey we keep it on campus, nobody ever says anything. Anyway, we got scattered. We came back looking for Jake and we found him here like this. - I've never seen anything so totally off in my whole life. Shit, Jake was a good friend. - Wait, wait, wait, you say you got scattered? I mean what does that mean? - We saw these three chicks, they were dancing around this grave stone naked. - What? - Is this a joke, kid? - No, ma'am, it ain't, it's true. They were chanting something like some kind of ritual. - Did you recognize any of these girls. - I think one of 'em is in my history class. - I've seen them around, I can get you their names for you no problem. - Yeah, you do that. - So you just came across these girls and you just walked away quietly and you let them have their privacy now, didn't you? - Well we sort of said hello. - And then one of the chicks she chased us off and, I guess Jake couldn't handle the excitement. We didn't know he had a weak heart. - Oh, actually according to medical records he didn't. - [Lutz] You just said hello. - No offense, ma'am, but I think Detective Gardner can understand this a little bit better than you. - Oh really, and what am I supposed to be so understanding about? - What are the chances of coming across an opportunity like this? Three naked chicks in a graveyard? Come on, you gotta fuck with them a little bit. Now I just wish we just left it alone. (organ music) - Marie, Marie, I'm really thinking about the character now-- - Girls, girls. - Are you sure you're okay? - Define okay. - There's some detectives waiting for you in the lounge. Come along. - Detectives? - Oh sisters, leave me alone, leave me alone. Please, please leave me alone. (sobbing) I have done nothing, please God, leave me alone. - [Sister] It's alright, sweetheart. Let's go back inside. - Come on darling, come on. Let's get you turned around. - You mean to tell me that this whole ritual was just some stunt to get in touch with your inner witches? (mumbles) - So I wouldn't expect you to understand. - Hey let me tell you what I understand, a boy is dead because of a school play. - That's not fair, it was an accident. - We didn't ask the boys to come snooping around. - Well maybe it was an accident and maybe it wasn't, that's what we're trying to determine. - It was a heart attack. - Yeah, and something must have precipitated it. - Well one thing's for sure, you all used poor judgment. You and the boys alike. So far, I don't see anything criminal, you can go. - But remember, this investigation, it isn't over yet, so don't leave town. - [Gardner] Well, what do you think? - There's something about all this that I don't like. - Well maybe your bra's on too tight. I think we should rule it an accident and close the case. - This black magic angle, it feels really bad to me. Oh and watch the sexist shit or else you're gonna be looking down a harassment charge. - You know, I got a bad feeling too. Nope, just my hemorrhoids. - [Lutz] Why are we stopping here, Will? What is this all about? - [Gardner] Well, well, well, look who's here. - Wish I could say I was more surprised. Now I'm even more bugged about this black magic angle. - What are you two doing here? - We're on an investigation. We parked on the other side of the forest. What are you doing here, more to the point. - Just poking around. Detective Lutz, Gardner, this is my fiance, Kelly Jordan. - [Gardner] Really. - Hi. - Good to meet you. - So what brings you here, Mr. Spanner? Besides the death, midnight graveyard rituals? - I don't know anything about any rituals. We didn't know about the death until we got here. We're just on our way to visit Kelly's sister Colleen. - Yeah, she's a student here, she's in the next play and I brought her dress to use in the show. - The parking attendant told us about the death when we got here. I was just looking around out of curiosity. - Just can't stay away, yeah, I know what that's like. - What's the prognosis? - I don't sense anything, no supernatural forces at work here. Probably just an accident. - That's it? - If you're holding out on us, anything at all, I'll have your ass Spanner, you got me? - I got you, Lutz, don't have a coronary. - Come on, let's go. - What was that all about, do you know them? - Yeah, our paths cross from time to time. There's another side of my life you don't know anything about, I have certain sensitivities. - Well, you know I love a sensitive man. - Well that's good because I have to level with you. I do feel a dark presence here and I think somehow Colleen is caught up with it and that's she's in grave danger. - My god, you just told the cops that you-- - I know, I know, I lied to them because they don't trust me enough to believe me entirely. They would only interfere. - I don't know what to think, Will, but I trust you and if you say Colleen's in danger, I mean I just can't ignore it. So what do we have to do? - I don't know yet, I gotta figure out what's going on here first. But at least we can warn Colleen to keep her eyes open. - Colleen's not gonna buy any of this. - Why not? - We were raised by religious fanatics. They were horrible people. We both rebelled against our parents in our own ways. I searched elsewhere into comparative religions. I became a spiritual person, but Colleen, she rejected it all. - [Will] Atheist? - If you don't believe in heaven, then why believe in hell or demons? - Well some of my best friends are atheists. We'll just have to get through to her somehow. - It won't be long now, my sisters. Not long now. Next, the right vessel for you to occupy. Someone young. (mumbles) Someone (laughs). Well connected. Oh, Colleen, did I scare you? - Marie, hi, no, I'm okay. Why you look like you're feeling better. - I feel incredible. Could you help me with something? - Sure, what is it? - It's back in my room, you have a minute? - Barely, let's hurry. - Colleen! Colleen! - Hi Kelly! - You can't hide from me. - I was wondering when you'd arrive. - [Colleen] What was it you needed from me, Marie? - Oh, nothing, we'll discuss it later, bye. - I brought you grandma's dress. - Oh wow, thanks, it'll be perfect. - This is my fiance, Will. Will? - Oh, how do you do? - Hi, oh my god, this is so cool. I have to go to class now but-- - We really need to talk to you, honey. - Oh I know, meet me in rehearsal room in about an hour. You can watch, okay? See you later, bye. (ominous music) - [Marie] Keri. - Hey what's up? - You gotta see this, come here. - What? - Come here. - Wow, what did you do? This is so cool. It's so cold in here. - [Marie] The ritual was a success. You know that, didn't you? - Marie? - Not anymore. What, are you afraid? You meant to do this, you and Ramsden. You did this together. - Yes, but... It worked? - Yes (laughs) and now I need a vessel for my sister. - But you need me to keep you hidden, to, to-- - I need nothing from you but your body. (clunks) (groans) So easy. (speaks foreign language) (dramatic music) - Sister. - Sister. - What is our next move? - We will find a vessel for the Master Abaddon, then he will guide us. (ominous music) - [All] Double, double, toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble. - Filet of fenny snake, in the... - Okay, stop. Are you with us today, Miss Jordan? - Yeah, yes, I am, yes, I am. - God you fucking suck, it's like doing a monologue. - Yeah, Jesus, Colleen, you're gonna stink up the show and make us all look bad. - Girls! Didn't you learn anything from your experience last night? No sense of magic? - Yeah, I did but I was so overwhelmed with what Keri and Marie were doing. It just threw me, I'm sorry. - You're sorry? - We'll just go back tonight and rehearse in the forest. - And then we can up the fear factor. We can perform the ritual again. - After what happened last night, are you crazy? - Now Colleen, before you censor yourself, I want you to realize, I don't think that's a bad idea. - I think it sucks, a boy died, there was a police investigation. - Aw, come on, Colleen, be a trooper. - Yeah, don't be so selfish, think of the show. - I don't know what happened, but you guys really changed. It's like I don't even know you, especially you, Marie. - Maybe it's not us who changed. - Yeah, maybe it's you. - Enough girls, do not gang up on her. Now Colleen, I need you to work closely with Keri and Marie, before we rehearse this section again. Learn from them. - You know what, I can't do this. - What do you mean? - What I mean is you're gonna have to find another witch. I quit. - Two weeks before we open? You wouldn't do that to us, Colleen. - Normally no, I wouldn't, but... This time I'm sorry, I just don't feel comfortable here anymore. - You did the right thing, Colleen. - We're so proud of you, sweetie. - I didn't do it for either of you two. - Colleen, she's upset, I'm gonna go talk to her. - I don't approve of your methods. - Who's that? - Would you ladies leave us alone, rehearsal is over. - We'll talk later. - Allowing those girls to perform that ritual was dangerously reckless. - Allowing them, these are all free agents, I'm not holding anyone at gun point. - No, and I suppose you didn't encourage them either. - Even if I had, so what? The death was ruled an accident and besides that the dead boy was an uninvited guest. He should take the blame for his own fate, if anybody. - Kind of cold. - That's just realistic, it's a cold world. - There's something more going on here. Something not quite natural. Something rotten and you're involved with it. - Do tell. - I'm gonna find out what it is, you better know that. (laughs) - Do tell. - Colleen, Colleen. - I really need to be alone right now, I'm kind of upset. - But Will and I need to talk to you, it's very important. - Alright meet me at 85 Winston Street later. There's someone there I really want you to meet. - Okay girls, move into it. Hold it. Okay, girls, hold it. Charming, ladies, charming. Wait for the light, ladies, there we go. Just like that, stay there. (mumbles) Again ladies. Here we go. Again, ladies. Look at me, ladies. - The Master Abaddon requires a vessel. - Mm, what do you mean? Abaddon can't cross over this world until the gateway's open. - Yeah, the gateway is necessary in order for him to walk this earth in his true form, but, his spirit may walk the earth even now. Provided, a suitable vessel is found. (shouting) - You've been possessed by the Sinobia sisters! - You are so smart! (groaning) (shouting) (laughing) (speaks foreign language) - Oh mighty Abaddon, warrior of Satan, accept this vessel. That you might help us in our dark task. - Open your eyes. - You have new ones now. - The thing now is to find the perfect vessel for our other sister. - Then with our combined powers, we will be able to resurrect the gateway we built so long ago. - All that will mean nothing without the stolen key. In order for it remain hidden all these years, there must be a guardian here, a custodian, watching over it. - It must be hidden on the grounds someplace. - My sister and I will find the custodian and we will retrieve the key. - Good and then we'll see about awakening your other sister. (laughing) - [Man] You mean you actually quit the play? - Yeah, it's just this play. This group of people, they disturb me. I don't know how to explain it. - Well maybe they're right, maybe this isn't the right school for you then. - Maybe, I don't know. So you guys really came up here to warn me about the ghosts and the ghoulies? - I know how it sounds, Colleen, but believe me I feel this kind of evil before. Believer or non believer, it will devastate you. - But I can't just pack up my things and leave school. I've got finals coming up. - I'm skeptical too, Colleen, but there's been a death, a police investigation, we have to be safe. - No. You can't shelter me anymore. I'm a grown up now. - [Kelly] Colleen, Will is only thinking of you. - Well let him think about somebody else. I mean thanks but no thanks. Look I don't know him and I don't believe in his so-called spiritual crap. - No, then why did you decide to go to a college run by the Catholic Church? - Because it's got a good drama department. It's a secular school and I can choose any class that I want. I can't leave Bruce, not over this mumbo jumbo. - I didn't say anything about leaving him. I'm not here to interfere with that. - No? So what are you here to interfere with? - Baby, I don't understand what kind of danger they mean, but I do see that they're genuinely concerned. - Oh god, not you as well. - Would it be such a bad idea? - [Colleen] I can't bear this. - We'll keep in touch wherever you go and when things settle down, you come back, and I'll be right here waiting. - Alright, let me just get through my finals first and then we'll think things through again okay? (eerie music) - There you are. - Father? - Huh? - Father Trista, oh, Father Trista. - We've been looking all over for you. - What are you girls doing here? Is there something wrong? - Not at all. - Is there a fire? - Only in your pants, hot shot. - No Friar, just lay back, relax. We're looking for something. If you tell us where it is, we'll give you the night of a life time. - Nobody even needs to know. - What is the meaning of this? I have taken a vow of celibacy. Now you girls leave here at once before I call the monks. - We are not fucking around here, Father. Well, at least not entirely. Do you know where the stone key is? - Stone key, I don't know what you're talking about. - Do you know who the custodian is. - Custodian? Custodian, yes, yes, our janitor here is Harry Smalliez. He works in the bathroom and the kitchens. - Oh yeah, we'll see if you're telling the truth. - Please, please, don't. I have taken a vow of celibacy. My Lord and the Holy Mother Church, please don't do this, please. Oh no, please, oh. (groaning) (moaning) Oh my god, what have you done to me? What have you done? - 300 years ago, we were prevented from opening the gateway to hell. We've returned to open it, but first we must find the stone key, do you know who guards it? - Stone key, I don't know what you're talking about. (clunking) (ominous music) - Father Trista, where are you, Father? (gasps) (screams) (car alarms beeps) - And that's when you saw the body? - Yes, that's correct. - [Will] What's going on? - Just a little trouble. What concern is it of yours? - Was there another death? - You guessed it, Christian, a priest was killed last night. - [Kelly] Oh my god. - Was he murdered? - Wasn't suicide. Go on up. I'm sorry, Sister, you were saying? - That's when I saw the body. - Alright, uh-huh. - Take a look at these markings. It's black magic ritual stuff. Tell me these two deaths aren't related. - Well looks like somebody copied this out of a book. - How can you tell that? - Well you've got unrelated rituals all jumbled together. My guess is somebody tried to make it look like a cult did this. - You're telling me that you don't feel some sort of a weird energy here? Like a dampness? - Well it's an old building, detective. You're not letting your imagination get the better of you, are you? - I got a feeling that you know more than what you're saying and I think you're fucking with me. Just a feeling, I can't prove it. - You're wrong, detective, really. - I better be. - Is that true what you told her? I mean what are the markings on this cross? - It's an invocation. It's a request for the demon Abaddon to accept a sacrifice. - Sacrifice? - It also makes mention of our old friends the Sinobia Sisters. I gotta do some research on them. - Yes, I think you should. (exhales) - [Woman] St. Sebastian Library, may I help you? - Yeah, I hope so, I've been searching here in the college records and the internet. How come there's no mention of the Sinobia Sisters? - [Woman] Witch sisters? - Yeah, the witch sisters. They performed satanic rituals and they were executed right here 300 years ago. - [Woman] Oh you've been listening to too many of Sister Seraphina's stories. - Whose stories? - [Woman] Sister Seraphina. She's bed ridden most of the time now, the poor dear old thing. But she does go on with those stories. The witches, and demons and what not. Caught the Alzheimer's you know? - Yeah, okay, thanks a lot for your time, bye. - May I help you? - Hello Sister, I was just looking for-- - These are the personal quarters for the sisters and the mother superior. You must've taken a wrong turn. - Must have. (organ music) Sister Seraphina. - Oh, I'm so glad you've come. - You are? - Yes. You have come to kill them, you must kill them. - I'll do my best, I'm only a man. - Their coldness gives them away. Their cold manner, their cold touch. - What do they want? - They were stopped from opening the gate 300 years ago. You must stop them again. - The gateway? - The gateway to hell. So that he will enter earth and cause hell on earth. - How can he be stopped? - He will take a host body. You must find the host and look into his eyes. That's where his power lies. - The eyes? - The eyes that have seen fire and hell, and then you'll find power and weakness. - Who are you, what are you doing here? - Old friend, I was just leaving. Thank you, Sister Seraphina. - Be careful, be very careful, you must not fail. - I'll do my best, I promise. - Good, oh good. - Monsignor, the police are here to see you. - Good evening, Monsignor Layton. - Good evening. - I'm Detective Gardner, this is my partner, Lutz. - Good evening. - How do you do? Let's get down to business, shall we? - [Gardner] So you make all the decisions about the school? - I don't make the day to day decisions, but I do have the authority to make all the ultimate ones. - But you're just one man and that's a little dictatorial, don't you think? - Well, Detective, I am after all the Monsignor of the di-a-cees. - Well then. - And I'm also a very busy man. I don't have time for small talk. I do hope that this is important. - Important, important? Your priest was murdered last week, or aren't you aware of that? Not to mention one of your students. - You dare speak to me that way in my own home? - Take it easy, Lutz. - We're only here because you insisted that we meet with you here, we would've much rather handle all of this over the phone. - This is more discrete, I thought I made that clear. - My partner and I have been studying these crimes very carefully and so far none of it has added up to a point. - [Layton] So? - So, that means that it isn't over yet and whoever did this will kill again. - Go on. - [Gardner] We want you to shut down the school voluntarily. This will save us the hassle of getting a court order. - You want me to close down the school with final exams one week away? That would cost a fortune in make up sessions. - This is all just about business to you, isn't it? Doesn't this church have anything to do with this place any more? - I am thinking of the church's best interest. Sometimes those decisions have to be financial. No, I can't grant your request. - You stupid sanctimonious-- - Easy Lutz. - We will get that court order, believe me. - You're only delaying us a short time, Monsignor. Good evening. (ominous music) (tense music) - [Keri] Father. - What are you doing here, Father? - Monsignor, Monsignor Layton. More to the point, what are you students doing here? This is the dormitory for the sisters. - We know, we were just-- - Yes? - We were looking for something. - Whatever it is, I'm sure it can't be here. - It might well be, it's been hidden a long time. - What's that? - That which we seek of course. - I don't know what you're talking about. (yelping) - Where's the stone key, motherfucker? - You, stone key, I don't know what you're talking about. - Stop fucking around Jesus boy and tell us where the stone key is or you will die tonight. Soon and painfully. - I told you I don't know what you're talking about. (screaming) - [Marie] It's only gonna get worse and worse until you come clean. - Never, never. - What about the door downstairs? Is there somebody there that you're protecting perhaps? - Just a frail bedridden old nun I was going to visit. (mumbles) God's love, that's all. - Fuck God's love. - Speak up now or die. - Alright, alright! I know where it is. And I'm the only one who does know. - Where is it? - You'll never know! - Hello Sister Seraphina, we've come to cheer you up. - What, what? - Yes, we're the good will committee. - I'm so cold, stay away from me, stay away from me. - Just as soon as you tell us where the stone key is hidden. I can smell it on you. We know you're the custodian, where is it? - You will never have it. - Enough, I can't take it anymore. - Oh the eyes, the eyes of fire. - We'll find it ourselves. (sniffing) - I found it, it's hidden in the wall. - The police are here again. You girls are turning this school into a (mumbles) house. It's amusing of course, but perhaps you could be less conspicuous at times. - [Marie] We have it. (laughing) - Excellent, excellent. You have done so well. Both of you. Soon I'll be able to enter this world in my true form with all the powers of hell at my disposal. (groaning) - We will need another body for our sister to inhabit. - It'll be the Jordan girl. She can be useful in more ways than one. - Yeah, we'll be with her tonight. My sister will see to that. - Yes, yes. - Excellent. That will bring Will Spanner running. Sugar to lure the fly. (laughing) - It was the Monsignor. Yeah, no, no. They're closing down the campus this time. They're evacuating everybody. I really could use a ride and a place to stay. Okay, I'll see you outside and thanks. - What's going on? - We're evacuating the school, it's a court order. We're shutting it down. - This has turned into a major killing spree. Chief's calling all the experts, it's not just our baby anymore. - Now that Colleen is safe, we should tell them everything. - What? - Tell us what, Spanner? - Yeah, that's what I'd like to know. What have you been holding out on us? - We need all the help we can get now. - You're right, honey, you're right. I haven't been completely straight with you two. - Oh do tell. - Go on. - Oh my god, Marie, you scared me. - You have to come here quick. - What's the matter? - Come quick. - I can't see anything. Where's the lock? - Don't do that. - It's so cold. - Yes. (mumbles) (yelps) (laughs) - If they manage to raise the third sister, then what? - Then they will be able to enter the gateway. - Gateway? - To hell. - Shit. - This demon, um. - Abaddon. - Yes, Abaddon, he'll be able to enter our world through it. (speaks foreign language) (groaning) (speaks foreign language) - The eyes, we should hit the eyes? - After we discover who the host is, yes. - Hey, hate to interrupt but check that out. - That's Colleen! Colleen! - No, oh no! (laughs) Come on! - [Kelly] Will, I can't see, the fog it's so thick. - I can't see the detectives. Lutz! Gardner! - Where are they? - Where are we? - [Lutz] I don't see them anymore. - [Gardner] Come on! - Wait! Gardner? (thunder clapping) Gardner? - [Gardner] Whoa. Hey. You can't, hey. - Don't resist me, you know you want it. - [Gardner] I can't do this. - [Lutz] Spanner? Kelly? Anybody? (screams) (groans) - Greetings, Will Spanner. - It's you, you're the demon Abaddon. I don't fear you, go away. - We've asked for Satan to promise to spare all the others if you return your allegiance to him where it belongs. - You go back to hell and you tell him he'll never have me voluntarily. (moaning) (yelping) (groaning) (moaning) (groans in pleasure) - What are you doing? - Jesus, Lutz, I didn't know it was you, how did you? What the hell? - This is just an illusion, this is all an illusion. - Yeah. - You used to have so much power, Spanner, don't you miss it? The power to possess, to control? Return to us, Spanner, submit. It can all be yours again. - Never. - All and more. - I'll die first. - It won't be you he takes if you refuse. It will be Colleen and he has special plans for her in hell. - No, not Colleen, please. - What do you say now, Spanner? - I can't let her die. - [Abaddon] Follow me. - Colleen. - It's not her anymore, she's one of them. - No, baby, no! - Now it is time to reveal the gateway. (shouting) - No Kelly! (zapping) No Kelly! You're alive, thank god, you're gonna be okay. - It's not so easy, my friends. Try something again, she may have to give her life for the cause. You don't mind, do you, my dear. - Not at all. - You're gonna be okay, hang in there, Kelly, you're gonna be okay. (laughing) So what now? - Well we wait for the key hole to reveal itself and the gateway will open so I may turn this place into Satan's glory on earth. Won't you join us, Mr. Spanner? - You leave me a choice? - None. Call out to Satan, pledge your allegiance now before it's too late. Call out to him before all these girls die. - Oh Lord Satan. (ominous music) - The key hole. - No! (zapping) - Turn the key, finish it! - You will regret that! Say good bye to your little lady. - No! (guns firing) (groaning in pain) (tense music) (growling) - [Abaddon] The key, the key! (mumbles) Help me, help me, help me, please! Help me! - You failed us. - Help me! - [Sister] You must pay. - You failed us. - You must pay. (groaning) - Kelly, Kelly, honey, Kelly. It's gonna be okay, you're gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Hello. - Hi. You going up to see Kelly? - Yeah and you? - Yeah. (laughing) - You really love her, don't you? - You know, I'll tell ya, I've been a bachelor all these years, but your sister, I'll marry gladly. - Well I'm glad to hear she's got that too. Now that I've got Bruce too. Did you hear we're engaged? - Kelly told me, congratulations. - [Colleen] Thank you. - So how have you been, really? - Um, good enough. You know we all healed nicely, went to different schools, but... - But? - Well it changes forever. Keri is thinking of joining sisterhood believe it or not. - You're kidding. - And Marie, she's been auditioning a lot for plays. She has a new group of friends, she's doing fine. - So how about you? Any auditions, are you getting any right now? - No, I'm not acting anymore. Well not now anyway. I just don't know whether it's the kind of life I wanna live. I've been doing a lot of looking inside lately. I'm trying to explore that side. - So you wanna explore your spiritual side, is that what you're telling me? - Spiritual, mental, metaphysical, physical, I just wanna learn and look and grow and understand. - Well this is wonderful. - What you and Kelly did really made me understand the meaning of sacrifice. I really started to look at things, the value of things. - That's great, that's really great. Let's go see your sister. - Okay. - Alright. (eerie electronic music)
