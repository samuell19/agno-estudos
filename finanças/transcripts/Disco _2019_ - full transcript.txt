Hello! Here's our superstar. -How's it going? -Huh? -How's it going? -Good. How does it feel? It feels pretty good. You were amazing on the floor. Fantastic. -This is for you. -Thank you! -Is that from you? -Yes. -Blue tongue. -Ready? Let me see. -Don't eat those. No, don't show it. -Additives. -Hi! -Hello. -How did it go? -And the winner is ... Mirjam Hane! That's me. I wish I could be there, but there's just too much to do. But well done. I knew it already. -I'm proud of you. -Thank you. Look. I want to post this one. "Congratulations!" That's lovely. There! -Raise your arm again, like that. -No. -Yes! Stretch your arm out. -No, that's just awkward. -There! That's great. -No, it's too "look at me!". -No! -Yes, that's nice. -Photo session? -Look how lovely they are. -Look at those two! -Smile a little. You look so sad. It's OK to look happy. -Lovely. -Wait. I want to join too! Look at that pretty family! You look lovely. -Smile! -You're also smiling, right? You could always smile a bit more. Beautiful. I'll say! Look at this! What an incredible color! Amazing, isn't it? So lovely. It's beautiful! I don't know what to say. You're so nice to me. You deserve it, honey. But is it okay if we hang it in the closet and don't show it to Per? Well... yeah? Because I've been spending so much money, and ... I notice that it stresses him. He's so stressed these days. And because of that he can't ..? It's just because I stress him out. It isn't easy. But you're nothing but nice. And you're always calm. It's not about that. You work so hard. Per walks around in sheep's clothing. What did you say, Mirjam? You must have thought ... Stop picking on Per! He's your father. I'm not picking on him. And he's not my father. -That just sounds weird. -What are you saying? -He's not my actual father. -Don't be so rude! I'm not being rude. He really isn't my father. Stop it! Okay. -When are we going to talk about my dad? -Mirjam, please! -You can't blame me for wondering. -But in that case ... -It was so long ago. -You need to stop now, Mirjam. Yes ... And then you should fill your heart with Jesus. You know that I do. I can drive you there, Ada. Are we on time? Yeah, just about. Let's count you. One, two, three, four... Ten. Everyone's here. Do you remember the story from last time? Let's read some more, then. A farmer went out to sow his seed. He walked around his big field and scattered seeds from his basket. Some of the seeds fell on the hard path nearby, - - and the birds came and ate it up. Some of them fell on soil that was full of rocks. The seeds started to sprout, - - but there was little dirt, so the plants didn't put down roots. But the seeds on the good soil made healthy plants and produced good fruits. And Jesus explained what he meant by this story. That the seed represents the word of God. But the Devil took the word from their hearts, so that they won't find salvation. so that they won't find salvation. Such a nice tale. Do any of you have any thoughts? -Yes, Elita. -When you can't see the pictures, - - you can pretend it's a story - - and make your own pictures in your head. Like in a movie. You make pictures inside your head. Very good. Did you raise your hand, Camilla? What did you think? If you don't have pictures in the book, you can make them in your head. That's right. We're on a tram On our way to heaven God is driving Jesus is the conductor It's so easy, easy, easy When you've been saved, saved, saved Praise the Lord in heaven! So that's great. Now we just need to trim it. So much material. It's hard to show moderation. Yes, indeed. Being here with you has been so incredibly nice. I'm glad. It's been so nice to have you here. -Really? -Yes. But Mirjam, I thought of something else. I'd really like you to come to one of our services with me. Samuel, my husband, he's the pastor there. And we hold our service in a lovely Catholic chapel, not far from here. Words can't truly describe it. You have to come. Yes, well ... I really appreciate you asking. -Yes? -Yes, really. -Hi! -Enjoying yourselves? -Yes. -I was just about to leave. -We're just summing up the day. -And what a great day it was! It's so much fun to see the kids' body language when they explore their limits. And they think no one can see them. -It's great. -They're so cute. -See you tomorrow? -Yes, tomorrow. Bye! -Well, hello! -Hello. -So you guys had a good time? -Yes. But her Bible group is special. So you should be a little careful. I don't know that much about it. I don't really trust her. Hi! Welcome. You've never been to church before? Just our neighborhood church. I've been to a Pentecostal church once. And a Lutheran one, of course. -For a wedding? -A funeral. -But never for a regular service. -That's normal. People are so thirsty! Hi, welcome! I'm Per. Hi. Per. Good to see you here. Help yourselves to water and coffee. Make yourselves at home. Johanne, could you take care of these newcomers? There are more glasses over there. Hi, are you thirsty? Hi there. Hi! -Are you nervous? -Yes. I can tell! -Hi, Pastor Trond! -Give me a hug. Good to see you. How are you? -A little nervous. -You'll do great. I'm so excited! -But you never know. -No, you don't. -Hi! -Hello! FREEDOM Come on! Jesus is your friend. First and foremost. He never forgets. You can return home. Jesus is your friend. When you need help. When you follow him. Rise and shine again. Thank you, Lord. You're the truth, the way, the life. It's great to gather around the Holy Spirit. So this is it! -This is real love! -This is real love! This is real love! This is real love! I can feel it all the way up here. Can you feel it? The energy in this room! Being with you here, in the name of God, - is powerful. It makes me happy. It makes me happy. It's easy to become a happy Christian in this room. Being Christian is what makes me happy. I'm a happy Christian. And being with you here, - - by virtue of Jesus - - and the Holy Spirit, gathered here ... That's huge. Huge. It's a party. It's one big party. There's something else - - I'd like to celebrate with you today. As you are our witnesses - - in the name of God. I hope you can forgive me - - for focusing on myself here for a moment. Actually not on myself, - - but on the holiest, - - most beautiful woman I know. My dear Vanja. There you are. I love you. On this very day 14 years ago, - - we met right here. And 13 years ago, on this very day, - - you said "I do" to me, on this very stage. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Vanja. For the best 14 years of my life. You are even more beautiful now than you were then. I know you don't like attention, but we're going to make an exception. Come on, Vanja. Come up here to me! I love you too, so very much. This is just fantastic. Can you feel it? And we are so proud of everything you do for this congregation. We thank you with pride and humility for all you give - -in the name of God. And no story is too insignificant for Jesus. Thank you. Wow! That's my wife, folks. No story is too insignificant for God. No fate is too insignificant for God. We are all significant to God. Or if she just needed a break. A break from life. Not end her life, just take a break. She had been clean for six months. Her treatment had ended. And she died alone in her new apartment. I couldn't deal with her depressions. I couldn't deal with her withdrawals. With her lies. I couldn't deal with those dark corners. Those evil minds I knew she had been exposed to. Doubting my faith. I doubt my faith. You may not think so, but I do. Of course I doubt. We are all human. I know the struggle. Why does God make it so difficult for us? Why? Why can't it be easy? Does he want us to doubt him? Is that what he wants? Or does he want us to doubt ourselves? Or does he want us to have hope? Hope that he, one day, - - will come and erase our doubt. Turn our doubt into faith. From doubt to faith. Are they not two sides of the same coin? Doubt and faith? This is explained in the Epistle to the Hebrews. Let me read a little for you. "Faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see." "This is what the ancients were commended for." Faith is confidence - - in what we hope for. Full confidence in what we hope for. By believing, we trust that God will remove any doubt, any pain, any suffering. And give us hope. Salvation. Eternal life. Even though it can't be proven. Because it can't be proven. Full confidence in what we hope for. Let me continue. This book is pretty interesting. You may have heard of it. It's called the Bible. Great book. I recommend it. Just start reading. It isn't half bad. "By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, - - so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible." What does that mean? What is seen was not made out of what was visible. Yes. It means that by believing in God, we understand - - that the world as we know it was not created - - by something that can be scientifically proven. What is seen was not made out of what was visible. What we see - - was created by an invisible world. And that invisible world is God! That is God. God is not of our material world. And therefore he can create something out of nothing. Out of the great void. But then you might ask, Who created God? The answer is simple. Something has existed for all time. It can't be something material, or something we can observe. It has to be detached from all time. So let us call that God. Let us name it God. What we can see was not made by the visible. Feel free to doubt. You can doubt and you can doubt. Because faith grows through doubt. Through doubt, pain, suffering, struggles. That is where faith grows. Rest in your doubt. Be patient in doubt. And let your faith grow through it. Surrender. Don't be afraid. Doubt is the greatest faith. Surrender. On the other side of doubt, is hope. Doubt is hope. And hope is faith. Doubt, hope, faith. Doubt, hope ... Faith. -The World Championship is soon? -She's won seven world titles. -It's OK to be proud of that. -Yeah, I'm also proud, but ... -And you're the favorite. -It's exciting. I do get a little nervous, but we'll see. I don't doubt for a second that you'll do great. This first time I saw you, I thought: God has a special plan for you. -Did you really? -I did. Without a doubt. I don't know. -You seem like a good leader. -She has all the right qualities. -You're persistent. -And you contribute so much. Free Connie of her pain, and cast this evil cancer out. I ask you, our Lord Jesus - -free her of this cancer. Hallelujah. Praise Jesus! Hallelujah. Hi! Hi, Ada. Bear hug! Squeeze harder! -Wow! -Fantastic. You've almost got it. Just a little more twist at the end. -I didn't know you were home. -You didn't? I just came home. Right. Well, look at you guys. How cozy! "Visionaries of Norway"? That's what we're watching? It's hysterical. Don't you agree, Mirjam? It is weird. -He is our uncle ... -It isn't that bad. That they even call themselves Christians is a stretch. -I think Uncle Kent is nice. -Maybe you shouldn't say those things. The problem is that it's a fraud. We should disassociate ourselves from it, no matter who he is. It's important to differentiate, and to make that very clear. And if we bring it into our home, it gets a bit difficult to ... It's like you thrive on these fights! Like they nourish you! What would you even do without all the fighting? How do you think it is for me to live in a home like this? -That has nothing to do with anything! -How do you think that makes me feel? Every single day I have to deal with all that. I'm not your past, Vanja. I'm not the guy who lost custody. I didn't do anything wrong. Yet I have to live in a secret location and deal with this insane nightmare. -It will stay put. -No, it won't. And now please welcome number 104! I wish I was - -a happy, bubbly person. Because I just feel - -disassociated. I see how I get pushed. It makes me hurt, physically. I have panic attacks at night. That was no good! I feel trapped. It's hard to explain. It's like I've been infected with a virus of pure grief. Couldn't sleep? No, of course not. You like watching "The Bloggers"? Not really, I just ... It was just - - to try to fall asleep. Disconnect a little. Disconnect from Jesus too? Eh, no. It isn't enough to believe, Mirjam. You have to live it, too. Every day. All in. Can those bloggers give you the energy you need? The rest, the input you need to achieve everything you want? What happened at your last competition? Mom said you ... collapsed? Maybe not that surprising - - when you're feeding your brain with mundane trash like that. You don't get much nourishment from that. Show that you're better than them. That you're a winner. Because you are. You need energy and rest, for practice and for work. In order to be present. That demands something extra from you. I know you're destined to be - - something special. You've been dealt all the cards. You just have to play them right. I dreamed about you the other night. You were on a stage, on a beach. With hundreds of thousands - - listening to you sing. The moon was out. It was a starry night. It was beautiful. You are beautiful. But you have to make sure to be just as beautiful on the inside. Even further up. And out... Yes, that's good. One more time. Start out more in that direction. And work it. A little better. The most important thing is that you just keep plugging away. Convince yourself that this is what it takes. In order to succeed. Are there other things that make you nervous - - before to the competitions, that may be affecting you? I don't know. Maybe some ... Just say the word if I can help you in any way. If you have questions. Or if you need answers to something. Something you can't figure out by yourself. That's just the thing. Hi, Mirjam. What's the matter? -Let's pray. It's been so long. -No. -Like when you were a little girl. -No, we're not praying. I need you to tell me. What he did to me when I was little. -Stop it. -Stop what? This. These strange stories. What stories? What are you referring to? -I don't know. -You clearly know what I mean. Since there's a story you won't tell me. I know that something happened to me. I know that he hurt me. All right, then ... Mirjam! Mirjam! What are you doing? Sit up. Sit up! Mirjam, please. Come on. Come on! Mirjam! Ada, go to your room. Stay there! Mirjam, honey. Please sit up! You were lucky. To survive. Any longer, and you would most likely have suffered brain damage. What do these voices tell you? Who are they? God. Or ... All the ... I think they're everywhere. Or inside of us, or in anyone thinking ... In anyone who believes in Him. I think I'm getting punished for not ... For not leading a good enough life. Or that my life, my way of living ... But do you believe in God? I have to. Have to? Why did he go to prison? Because he sexually abused my cousins - - and used to beat my mother. That isn't ... That must have been hard for a young girl to cope with. And hard for your mother, of course. I was five years old. So I don't know. I don't know what she felt back then. She doesn't want to talk about it. Or, she won't talk about it with me. We just ... If I ask, - - she refuses to talk about it, because she has Per, and ... Yeah. I'll make you something to eat. -What are you doing? -Braiding. I go like this ... There, on the glued side. Then I lift the pebble. Then I do this with the glued side. Depression, exhaustion, burnout ... Tough periods, especially when you have to go through them alone. Yes, because you were alone. You were not a friend of Jesus. And your family let you down. So how did you manage to ... The congregation is struggling. You know that. Well, do you, or don't you? Why not trust me instead of making these accusations ... Confronting me with notices ... I do trust you. That's not the ... You promised. Your way of bringing this up makes me so dejected. It's like you ... ... think I hide it from you. That I'm lying to you. How do you think it feels, me being so dependent on you? You're all that I have. You and the children. Without you I'm nothing. Yet I have to live with your incessant nagging, always when I least expect it. Whenever my guard is down, bam! How do you think that makes me feel? You're making me a nervous wreck! I'm always walking on eggshells around you! Why haven't you said anything to Mirjam? Afraid she won't forgive you? If I leave, I'm taking Ada with me. You do realize that? She shouldn't have to cope with this. Stop it. She was also related to one of my best friends. So I also lost one of my best friends in the world. And I can't apologize to him. I can only say how sorry I am here. I didn't know what I was doing at the time. I hope you can forgive me. I have asked God for salvation, - - but I realize that doesn't help you. I lost myself. I lost everything. -Yeah, sure. -Are you sad? A little. Just a little. Oh dear, I don't know what to do with myself right now. -Just keep it up! -Yes. Let's meet up and sort this out soon. Yes, that'd be fantastic. Oh no! That isn't the first time you've spilled! Like all Christians I received a calling to expel demons and liberate prisoners. And no one in society is as trapped by the Devil - - as the homosexuals being led astray by the demons, away from the will of God - - and straight to hell. They are especially important to cast out. So that their spiritual influence doesn't affect you. His sexual orientation has nothing to do with our work, - - yet we're sinful in the eyes of all. -We're exposed. There is no shame in Christ. God has liberated us from shame to live in freedom in his name. And healing by Jesus goes through you. You are good at transmitting that power, and André is ready to receive. I ask you, God, with his parents' support, in the name of Jesus, - - that these homoerotic demons - - leave you now, immediately. Deep breaths, now. So exhale your demons. If you feel nauseous or get a headache, - - that's demons leaving your body. God tells me that you have a pure heart. Satan's forces are now defeated. Do you already have a mortgage? Will this come on top of that? Will repaying me be a struggle? I will help you anyhow, but ... I trust you, but I'm a bit worried about Per. You don't have to worry about Per. I'm responsible for this mess. I'm not worried about you, just Per. I tend to see through things. -We don't know for sure. -Yes, we do. You just don't see it. -Because he's my brother? -Do you know what he did the other day? He took a man's welfare check, in exchange for salvation! -That's stealing! -It wasn't meant like that. Stop bad-mouthing my brother! He's a good person at heart. -What are you doing? -Nothing. I'll tell you: You're keeping me and Ada awake. I'm trying to listen to something. -I'm sorry. -But things are good here ... otherwise? Like on stage in church? Mirjam! Come here, please. You do realize that you can't walk around dressed like that? What will any man think when he sees you like that? You need to be aware of the signals you're sending. You'll make them imagine things. It's disgusting. So please? -Guess what. -What? -I have to go to practice. -No! I want to go with you. I can understand that. That would be nice, but I have a private session with Øyvind. Can't I come with you anyway? Nope. But you can come tomorrow. I promise. -No. -Yes. -Practice in the meantime. -Fine. Hi there. Hello! In Matthew, - - chapter 7, verse 15, - - it is written: "Watch out - - for false prophets." "They come to you - - in sheep's clothing, - - but inwardly they are ferocious wolves." "By their actions you will recognize them." "Like you recognize trees and bushes - - by the fruit they bear." "Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes, - - or figs from thistles?" "Every tree - - that does not bear good fruit - - is cut down - - and thrown into the fire." I'm so glad you could join. It was great to have you there. Thank you for having me. Quite different from Freedom, I imagine. Yes, a bit. I don't know Freedom that well. I don't want to say anything bad, but ... There's a lot of bells and whistles. Lights and sounds and guitars. -I've even seen a smoke machine. -Yeah. And then ... Then I feel - - that the path to God feels that much longer. Believe me - I haven't always made God super happy. I have stepped off the straight and narrow path. I have fallen into the heather, the lake. And you may wonder: "What did you do, Pastor Trond? Interpret the Hymn too literally?" And my response is: What I did, doesn't matter. What matters is that I have asked for forgiveness. I turned to the man up there, the Boss himself, and said: I'm sorry. I am a sinful man. I gave in to temptation. And he listened to me. He answered. And he established a structure for my life. And that has made my life much better. And he has established a structure for you too. Because he loves you. It will make your lives so much better. Because the Bible says: "That each of you should learn to control your own body - - in a way that is holy and honorable." "Not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God." But if anyone here knows God, it's you! I have faith in you. He has faith in you! "No one should seek their own good, - - but the good of others." That resonates so well today. What I find to be important in my life, - - is the certainty that God is there for me. And that Jesus loves me just as I am, with all my flaws. And that I can find solace in his words, every day. Through his surrender, he gives us so much in return. So if you feel like giving today, you can. Either by app, or by credit card.. I have also brought a lovely glass bowl. And there's a fun fact about this. Do you recognize this, Per? This is a bowl Per and I got for our wedding. I'll pass this around. Give it an applause! Nice, right? Just give if you feel like it. Come on, Ada! You'll do great! Bravo! Good job! Great! Good job, sweetie! And now: nr 541, Mirjam! -Are you OK? -Yes. -I just ... -What? -I'm so sorry. -No, no. Of course it's great when everything is going your way. But if life isn't that great, it's the Devil dragging you down. So what is your plan now? I need to know. I may be the last person who can truly help you. And that happens to be something I'm really good at. I can tell that this is a huge problem you'd rather keep hidden. So let's work on it together. Mirjam, let's do this together. -Hello? -Yes. Well? I think the Devil may be at work here, distracting you away from Jesus. I know you love Jesus, so that will break you down. Depressive thoughts, the work of the Devil. We must drive him back out. He fights every day, Lord, for you and with you. Give him strength. Don't let him lose faith. And let his body heal. Amen. This is the body of Christ. This is the blood of Christ. The children usually sleep up there. Some of the counselors also sleep there. I see. There are a lot of them. -Or at least ... -We had extra many this year. -That's fun for us. -That's great. Over there is where Samuel and I stay. That's where we sleep. And we have a room for you there. Great! Several people you have met sleep there. But it all belongs to us. This part of the island is ours. -That's amazing. -Yes, it's lovely. You have a way with children, so you'll find lots to do here. -Come on over when you're ready. -Yes. Thank you. -We're so glad to have you here. -Thank you. Is everyone ready? "For wide is the gate - - and broad is the road that leads to destruction." "And many - - enter through it." The wide gate and broad road - - are for those who call themselves Christians. Who say their prayers. Who attend church. Who praise Jesus. Who even - - call themselves saved. But at the same time looks like the world. Smells like the world. And acts like the world. The wide gate and broad road - - are paved with the Devil's temptations. And they lead to hell. Go through that narrow gate. Walk the narrow road that rejects the world. But that honors God. Through sacrifice and struggle. Through piety and submission. Some of you believe. And some of you believe you believe. And we all know what happens - - to those who don't follow Jesus. And practice makes perfect. So say after me: "I am here to practice." "I am here to become pure." "I shall be pure." "I shall practice." "I shall become a soldier of Jesus." "I shall die for Jesus on the cross." Raise your arms to the heavens. "I am willing, God." "I am willing now, Lord." The Holy Spirit will speak to you. Open yourselves to him. Open up to the Lord. Let it flow through you. Hallelujah! "I say yes to Jesus!" "This is the best day of my life!" "This is the day I was saved, Lord!" "Thank you, Jesus!" "Thank you, Jesus!" It's been hard for me, lately. I feel doubt. I find it very hard - - to believe in a God you never see. And we know so little about him. How would we recognize him, if he returned? And sometimes I don't even believe what I read in the Bible. I feel false. I feel like a hypocrite. And I feel guilty. I feel shameful. I feel mean. And I feel ungrateful. I feel rejected, in a sense. -You feel rejected. -Yes. I understand that, Charlotte. Do you want me to pray for you? Dear God, - - take this child. Strengthen her faith, Lord. She is fighting so hard, Lord. Would you like me to purify you? Are you ready? Roll up your sleeves. I love you, Jesus. I want to be with you, Jesus. -I will meet you, Jesus. -I will meet you, Jesus! I will die for you, Jesus. I am with you on the cross, Jesus. -I am with you when you suffer, Jesus. -Hallelujah! You each get a bag. Place it over your nose and mouth. If you feel tingling in your arms or legs, - - or if you feel dizzy or nauseous - - or anything like that, that is only good. Because do you know what that is? No? It's the demons being forced out of you. Because the Devil continuously plants demons in you. All the time. But today you are going to expel them. Ready? Okay? Go ahead. Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! I want to die for Jesus! I want to die now! I am a hypocrite! I am a hypocrite! I am a soldier of Jesus! -Louder! -I am a soldier of Jesus! -Come here! -I am unclean! -I am unclean! -Yes, you are. The end is here. He has come to take you away. Only the purest of you, those who have taken the narrow road. You are under attack! -No! -Yes! Demonic forces will try to stop you. The end is here! Run! -Run! -Run! You are under attack! Run! Hold her under. Roll over. There. Now you are cleansed. Now your path with God is true and pure. It's so good to see - - that you have found peace in the Spirit. I have. Truly. And it feels good? It feels very good. It feels like - - I understand - - more than ever before. And that I know where I am going. If you understand. Your thoughts are a little clearer. Very much so. That's good to hear. It's nice.
