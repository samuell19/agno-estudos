Hello? Hello? Stop. Don't move. They can see us. What is this? I don't know. Where are we? Where do you think? Hello? Oh, my God! It's all right, okay? It's all right. You're okay. Help! Help! Just calm down! - John! - You're fine. Where are you? Oh, shit. Is she dead? I think so. Jesus Christ. What was that? I don't know. What was that? Oh, shit. What the fuck? - What? - Everyone freeze! - Oh, my God. - They can see if we move. Stand still, and we'll be fine. Don't lift your feet off the ground. And don't touch anyone. - What's that noise? - Shh! Oh, my God. Where's that coming from? Quiet! Okay, now... calm down. Calm down. It's no use! - Everybody calm down! - No. - We need to calm down. - Everybody! Calm the fuck down! Just... just think! Breathe. Here we go. Everybody shut up for one second! Does anybody know what the hell's going on? They're killing us. No, it's not them. Are you guys seeing this? The lights on the floor... you see them move? - No, I don't see anything. - What lights? What are you talking about? Look at your hands. When you move them, it changes the floor. Oh, shit. Yeah. I only see one. Yeah, I only see mine. I think you can only see your own. What did they do to us? I think they messed with our hands. What does that mean? - It's us. - Us? What do you mean? We're choosing who dies. - Fuck! - What happened?! Somebody did it. Nobody fucking do anything, okay? Well, it's not working, you see? We have to try something. Nobody do it!! Okay. God damn it! - What the hell? - What is wrong with you people? All of us, We're gonna die! All of us, We're gonna die! We're all fucked! Oh, my God. This is unbelievable. It's a vote. What? We're voting. Look, they're killing whoever gets the most votes. How do you know that? Because the chimes go off when you close your hands. And that's when you choose. We should try not doing it again. Forget it. Someone's gonna screw it up. Wait. What if we... what if we vote for her again? Yeah, let's try that. Okay. Guys, that's not... no, that's not gonna work. We have to try something. Yeah, everybody, let's vote for the dead woman again. - Really? Are you serious? - Come on. You guys picked the wrong person. - No, we didn't. - Guys, it just doesn't work. But why him? Maybe he got the second-most votes. - Or the most so far? - We have to try something. No, I-it's not gonna work, guys, okay? There's nothing we can do. We're all screwed. - Let's try not voting again. - Please. - It's not gonna work. - We need to try. Okay, nobody vote. Let's wait it out. How do we know that won't kill us all? 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5... Is it over? - Oh, my God. - Okay, nobody move! Just everybody let's ride this out. No! If we don't choose, it chooses on its own. Somebody needs to do something! This is not working, obviously. - When you said that... - Everybody quiet! Now, there is no reason for us all to just keep killing each other off like this. Well, what the hell else are we gonna do, my man? We don't have a choice. What I mean is we can choose to go about this in a certain way. Look. So There's about a minute or two between each round. That's not a lot of time. Yeah, no shit. Maybe if we spend less time worrying about who's gonna die next and more time trying to figure this thing out, we'll get somewhere and be able to stop this. What do you suggest? Okay, I've been looking around the circle. And I see five or six people in their 70s and 80s. If this is a vote, I say they go first. That'll buy us some time. - Please. - No, no, hell, no, man. - Mnh-mnh. - Are you serious? Look, the way I see it, they'd be the next people to die in real life, right? What's the difference? He's right. Old people first. That's, uh, t-that's fair. How is that fair? They'd be the next to die anyway. Yeah, of natural causes, not of us killing them. - What's the difference? - This is crazy. - We have no choice. - That's fucked up, kid. It's a fucked up situation, but we have to do something. Which one first? We'll start with him, go clockwise after that. 1, 2, 3... Now wait a minute. 4, 5, 6. That should buy us 10 minutes. No, no, no. There has to be another way. You have a better idea? Anyone? We're sorry. It's the only way. But I have just as much of a right to live as any of you. You've lived your life, old man. Please. Please! Okay. I know that was hard, but you all did the right thing. We're gonna have to make some difficult decisions. Just shut up, all right? We get it. You wanted to buy some time, and we did that. Let's not waste it. Let's figure out what the hell this is. Any ideas? Come on! Somebody? What about him? - Who, me? - Yeah, I mean, you ought to know something about this. I don't know anything. - Oh, bullshit. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you guys have to know. Know about what? Uh, how about... what about a fucking alien invasion? - I don't know. - What? Look, I know just as much as you do. - Bullshit, man. - I swear I don't know anything. Well, does anybody remember anything else? I was in glendale. Yeah, I do. We were stuck in traffic on the freeway. - Me, too. - So was I. Right, uh, we were trying to get out of the city, but it was total log jam, so I got out of the car and... and started running. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everybody was running. Yeah, and then everything went dark. That's what I remember. So, what happened? - I was pulled up. - Into the ship? I don't know. Tractor beam? Fuck. - So are we in the ship now? - Do you think there are other people doing this? Other circles? They wouldn't go through all of this for just 50 of us. Why Would they do this? I don't know, but the next time that I could see, I was in a small room, and everything was red, like, um, like a darkroom. And there were a ton of bodies piled up on one another. I assumed that they were dead, but I don't know. They might have just been unconscious. Everybody but me and one other guy. - An alien? - No. No, no, no, he was a human. - Who? One of us? - I don't know. I don't see him in here. Everything else is kind of a blur. I just remember waking up right here, and there was... Some kind of gas. I think that we were all drugged. Does anybody else remember anything? Come on. Anybody! Yeah! Yeah. I do. - You? - Yeah. I remember the... the red room. And I-I saw him. And I saw them. Well, what did they look like? Well, they were big and black... dark green, maybe. A-a-and wet. And they spoke, too. It sounded almost like Chinese. Chinese? Yeah, Chinese, or Japanese, maybe. Chinese aliens? Bullshit. He's lying. Yeah, he's next in line. He's just trying to buy some time. No, II-I swear. Uh, tell them. Tell them you saw me. You see? He's full of shit. I swear I'm telling the truth. Just give me some time to think. It's a trick. Don't believe him. It's coming back to me. It's coming back... numbers. I remember numbers. And there was something else. That they... now, where were we? Wait. Who's next in line? Her with the hat. Who, me? Yeah. How old are you? 52. - That's not old. - Old enough. Hey, we said 70 or 80, not 50. What's the difference? That's a big difference. Come on, lady. You're not 52. How old are you? Don't lie. - I'm 52. - Bullshit. Yeah. Why's your hair so white? Chemotherapy. I had cancer. Aren't you supposed to be bald, then? What kind of cancer? Breast cancer. So You're dying, then? No. It's in remission. I'm better now. You sure? Yeah. I beat it. It could come back, though. What the fuck is wrong with you? I'm just saying she's more likely to die than the rest of us. That's not true. What are you, a doctor, lady? Actually, yes, I am, asshole. Look, cancer or not, she's over 50. She's gonna have to go eventually. - What? - We never agreed to that. - Yeah, no way, man. - I mean, what, do we start killing off people over 40 next? I'm 43. You gonna kill me next, asshole? - Hey, you got a problem? - Yeah, I got a problem. I think maybe anyone over the age of, maybe, I don't know, 35 might have a problem. What do you guys think? Okay, hey, now... just hold on a second. Let's... I'm just trying to help. Fuck you. Listen. We Can't be afraid to talk to each other in here. It's the only way We're gonna figure out how to stop this. Come on, man. We're not gonna stop this. We're just fucked. We don't know that. Exactly... we don't know anything yet. If they wanted to kill us, they Would have done that already, but they didn't. So let's use this time and try and figure out why. Okay. What do we do? Maybe we should figure out why they chose us. Chose us? Yeah. Why they picked us to be in here. It was a giant space vacuum, right? I don't think we were hand-picked. Yeah, he's right. This is... this is just random. We don't know that. Maybe it wasn't random. Maybe they chose us for a reason. There's probably a zillion people doing the same thing. We're doing right now. Okay, but it's just us in here, right? I think we need to know more about each other. Maybe if we do, this will all make sense. It's worth a shot. Anybody want to start? Uh, yeah. I'll go first. Hi, I'm Beth. Um, I live in woodland hills, California, but originally I'm from Richmond, Virginia... born and raised. I've worked in human resources for the past 11 years. Um, I just kind of fell into it. I actually went to college to be an English major... university of Virginia. Go Wahoos. I'm 36, single. No kids. But I do have two nephews from my sister Noreen. She's actually my twin sister. What else? Um... Oh, I have a dog. Her name is Cloody, and she's a terrier mix. And I have two cats, J.J. And Ricky. Oh, my God. Um... I-I think that's about it. I-is there anything else I should say? No, that's great. Great job. Who wants to go next? What?! At least she didn't have kids. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. - Me, too. - So what? That doesn't matter. She was still a human being just like any of you. - What was her name? - Beth. Maybe we shouldn't say our names. Why not? How does it help? What's the point in talking at all then? No, no names. He's right. We don't make this harder than it already is. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, if it's anonymous, it's... what? Easier to kill everyone? That's not what I was gonna say. - I'll say it then. - It doesn't matter. Names aren't necessary. Someone else should speak. How about you? - Me? - Yeah, You're next in line. No, fuck that, man. I ain't saying shit. You seen what happened to her. She ain't say nothing wrong. Well, someone should speak. Okay. I will. I'll try to keep this short. My name's Craig. Hey, no names. Right, I'm sorry. Anyway, the reason I'm saying anything is because my wife is standing next to me. I thought that Would be important. That Can't just be a coincidence, right? Well, is anyone else related? Anybody... Know each other? Yes. I know her. Susan. How? We're, uh... Coworkers. Neighbors. Never mind. It's not important. Affair... got it. Anyway, I-I just wanted to ask everyone, respectfully, please don't vote for my wife. You can vote for me, but, please, just spare my wife. No. No, everyone will take that into consideration. Okay, thanks. Uh, okay. Um, uh, you go next. Come on, go. Hey. Do you speak English? - Oh, well, he's gone. - I-I-it's okay. I-I speak Spanish. We don't need a fucking translator. Yeah, I'm sorry, but he's right. It's a waste of time. - No, it's not. - Señor. What's he saying? See? It's already wasting time. No, it's not. We're all human beings. Yeah, we all count the same in here. We shouldn't kill someone else over someone who Can't even contribute to the conversation. Hhhe's right. That's not fair. I mean, I'll bet he's not even here legally. - Oh, my God. - Yeah, what, now you need a green card to be fucking abducted? You know what I'm saying? I mean, he shouldn't even be here. What does that matter? Ask him if he was in the country legally. Ask him. No. Ah, see? Come on. It doesn't matter. Sure it does! This guy was probably hanging out in front of the home depot with 20 other illegal aliens. Whatever. Look, while the rest of us were running away from the ships, he was probably running towards one going, "trabajo, trabajo!" You know what, asshole? These guys work their asses off for barely minimum wage. Taking American people's jobs. - Here we go. - What? You don't think I work hard? Yeah, I'm sure your corner office is a real drag. Hey. Hey. Hey. - Who, me? - Yeah, don't I know you? Huh. I wonder why. No, seriously... he asked if we knew anyone in here. I know him. I don't know you, man. You're a mechanic in north Hollywood. Raul. Raul Jimenez. - I remember you. - What'd he do? I didn't do shit. He's lying, man. He beat the shit out of his girlfriend... really bad. At least, I think it was his girlfriend. Hopefully not anymore. Come on, man. Serious? Are you sure it was him? Yeah. I remember him 'cause of that tattoo under his right eye. That teardrop... see it? - Fuck you, man. - What's it for? It's for my cousin. He got shot. By a pig like you. Yeah, and it's my fault you guys are criminals. He was 16. One less criminal on the street. Fuck you, man. Is it true or not? - About his cousin? - I don't know. No, about him. Yeah, it's true. Tell them. Tell them how you beat the shit out of her. And it wasn't the first time, and it won't be the last time, either. Tell them! Okay, maybe we shouldn't stereotype in here. Bitch got what she deserved, man. - Shit. - There he is. See? These assholes... man, these assholes never learn. She shouldn't have fucked around on me, man! Like that makes it okay to beat the shit out of her. Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do, man? You gonna shoot me? Huh, pig?! I don't think I need to. Recognize anyone else? No, I don't think so. Yeah, anybody else? Unpaid parking tickets? - What if that's important? - Huh? Like, maybe We're supposed to figure out who's good and who's bad. The world doesn't work that way, sweetheart. That's right. Too much gray area. But maybe that's what they want us to do... kill off certain people. And, like, oh, my God, who's gonna decide? You? No, not me. All of us... as a group. Kind of what We're doing already? Kind of not stopping this whole thing at all? We don't know that. It might. There has to be a reason behind all of this, right? God, sweetheart. Not every shitty thing that happens in this world has to have a reason behind it. Maybe they just want to fucking watch us kill each other. Well, we should at least consider it. Consider what? What she means is... who deserves to live? Okay. Based on what? Based on everything. Morals and values, what you have or haven't done in life. I think we need to put it all out there. Yeah, and we've got plenty of time standing around debating everybody's character. Well, We're here to do something. It's to die. H-hey, um... I got an idea. How about we, uh... How about we kill all the black people next, yeah? What are you talking about? Don't play the race card, man. This is all just fucking chance. Yeah? Right. That's why most of us are dead, right? It's every man for himself in here. Yeah, you need to shut up with this racism stuff, okay? Nobody gives a shit around here. I give a shit around here. Look, I'm just saying. I'm not fucking next, all right? Y'all done reached your minority quota. That's fair. This guy... man, do you see anything fair going on in here?! This is the exact fucking opposite of fair! Okay. We'll see. Don't look at me, man. You started this shit. Come on, man. You know I'm right, brah. Think about it. They'll kill each and every one of us off until There's none of us left. Come on, man. There's plenty of white people that are dead, too. Come on, man, There's plenty more still alive, too. What exactly are you trying to do with this? Make yourself a target? Because that's exactly what You're doing. Yeah. Real smart. You don't see me counting asians. Well, maybe you should try. Don't fall for this racism bullshit. He's just trying to save his own ass. You damn right, you uptight asshole. - So what? - So what? You feel like you deserve a free pass because You're fucking black? Nobody cares. Exactly. Nobody gives a shit. I ain't talking to your stupid ass. I'm trying to help you, bro! You shut the fuck up, talking to me, man. It's not gonna fucking help you here. Right. 'Cause it usually helps me out there, right? Oh, here we go. Let's all feel bad for the black guy. 'Cause he had to struggle so much more than we did. All right. Just drop it. Like you people don't get enough help. What the fuck you just say? You guys are all the same. You run around. You just want people to hand you things like you fucking earned it. That's what wrong with this country now... socialist bullshit. What? You want some reparations, too? I mean, Jesus Christ. Give me a fucking break around he... I think we need to keep our personal prejudices out of this. It's not helping the situation. Yeah, they don't matter anymore. No, no, hell no. They absolutely matter! What you mean? I'm not gonna die so some racist can live. Everything... every single thing needs to be out there on the table. Yeah, so if we could have all the racists step forward, that'd great. Look... whatever your race, ethnicity, nationality is, it's not important. What's important is that, collectively, we figure out how to stop this. We're on the same team here. Oh, are we, though? We all want to live, don't we? Yeah. So let's work together. We Can't keep turning against each other. Yeah, that's what they want us to do. I think she's right. That's what this is about. They want us to play their little game. Maybe they're watching us right now. - Studying us. - Let's not give them - what they want. - Exactly. Any ideas? What happens if we force a tie? - We tried that. - No. We tried not voting at all. There'd be more time between rounds. Hey, everybody. Vote for yourself. Hhow do we do that? You Can't vote for yourself. It doesn't let us. All right, then, everybody vote for the person to your right, then. The living person. Right, don't vote for the empty spaces. If we do it right, we should all get exactly one vote. 8, 7, 5, 4... 3, 2, 1. No! - The fuck? - Damn it! - It didn't work. - Ohh! - What happened? - We screwed up. - All right, let's try it again. - It won't work! They thought of everything! Did you vote for the person to your right or your left? I did right. This way. Well, somebody messed it up. Somebody just made a mistake. Okay, look, we have to try this again. All right. Very carefully this time, everybody vote for the arrow that points to the person on your right. Got it? Sweetie, you see the arrow? This arrow... You're gonna pick that arrow, okay? Okay. No, We're all gonna be okay. I promise, okay? - Come on! - No! It's a tie. Everyone vote again! What the fuck just happened? - They tied. - How? We all got the same number of votes, right? No, we didn't. How do you know? - 'Cause I voted for him. - What? What are you... why Would you do that? Because he voted for the pregnant girl. I saw him. If I didn't vote him, she'd be dead. - You sure? - Yes. Why Would he do that? Look... We all know that we Can't vote for ourselves, right? Well... What do you think happens when we get down to the last person left? One of us gets to live. It's a game. It's a process of elimination. The last man standing gets to walk out of here alive. Or woman. Why Would they do that? I don't know, but between the kid and the pregnant girl, I'm sure that guy figured it's most likely gonna come down to one of them in the end. If we get rid of them, we'll all have a better chance. You know what? If he's right, and one of us do get to walk out of here, it should be one of them. Why's that? 'Cause it's common sense. People, come on. Things are different in here. Women and children first... I'm sorry. But that shit doesn't matter anymore. Look at the pregnant woman. She counts as two people. One of them's gonna die eventually, so... Which one? It's okay. It's okay. It's gonna be okay. No! No! No! Oh, come on, come on, come on! Don't do anything! They'll both die. We have to know what happens. What is wrong with you people? She's just a kid. Why Would you go after her? One of them has to die. We need to decide. - No, we don't. - Listen, we should just leave them out of this for as long as possible. Let's just forget about it. No, we Can't do that - - not anymore. - Why not? It's too dangerous for them. They've been exposed. Oh, come on, no one is going to vote for them again, right? She's never heard of birth control, so she gets to live? We need to come to a majority decision before each elimination. Otherwise, they are constantly gonna be in jeopardy. He's right. We need to protect them now. We don't even know what kind of a kid she is. I mean, what if she's a miserable brat? She's like 10. Hey, kid, you get good grades? - Uh-huh. - Yeah, yeah. Straight a's? Oh, my God. She got a "b." Let's kill her. Look, at least one of them is gonna have to die. So we should decide now. Just kill them both! Just fucking kill them... what about volunteers? - What? - Volunteers? - Are you nuts? - I don't know. Maybe someone wants to step forward. I'll do it. - Why? - Now, wait a minute. He doesn't have to tell you or anybody else why. He's volunteered. That's enough. Well, I want to know why. Lady, it's none of your business. Hey! Let him answer. Why? I guess I just don't want to kill anyone. How old are you? 16. No, someone else. What do you mean "someone else"? He's a fucking kid, man. He's 16. That's old enough. - Old enough to what, to die? - To make your own decisions. He's a stupid kid. He doesn't know any better. I don't care. If you volunteer, you volunteer. It's his choice if he wants to die. Yeah, yeah, that's right. If someone wants to volunteer, we should respect that, no matter who it is. Son, what's your name? I'm Shaun. Shaun. Are you sure that you want to volunteer? No. I'll do it. It's fine. Whew. Well, uh, this is gonna be a whole lot easier if we can get a few volunteers. Easier for who? You? Look, we got to take control of this situation. And this is the best way. I mean, hey, if We're all gonna die, it might as well be on our own terms. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that'll teach those fucking aliens. Hey, We're doing what we can, man. Yeah, it's the best idea we got. Then you volunteer. I don't see you stepping forward. We should all step forward. I mean, everybody but her. So mass suicide, then? Well, that... that's great. Let's do that. Hey, uh, kid... You still want to volunteer? No. Yes. You're a fucking hero, kid. You know that? Yeah, right. No, I'm serious. Look, if I make it out of here, I'm naming my next kid after you. - Thanks, Scott. - Thank you, Scott. Fucking assholes. You knew his name was Shaun! Whatever. The kid's a hero. Yeah, he bought us two minutes. Somebody toss him a purple heart. All right, enough. What? What are you looking at me for? Oh, you think it should be me? I was in Afghanistan for the past two years risking my life to keep the rest of you safe. I just got back two days ago. I was on my way to see my family. I got a 7-month old who doesn't even know who I am. My wife... I haven't seen my wife in... I'm not fucking dying in here. I'm not. I'm going home to them. Don't worry... I'm not voting for you. Me, neither. Yeah, We're... We're gonna get out of here, man. - Yeah, sure we are. - Come on, man. No, you come on, man. He knows the truth. We all do. Let's just accept it. Just stop. You're gonna die, dude. We all are. Time is, uh, running out. Yeah, we still need a volunteer. Anybody. I volunteer. My son, Oscar... He passed away last year. - He was riding... - His motorcycle. It's okay. I've forgiven him. You'll see him again. Do you think? Absolutely. Okay. I go in peace. Bye, everybody. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. "You'll see him again. Absolutely." - Bullshit. - Yeah, seriously. He was just trying to give her some peace in her last moments of life. There's nothing wrong with that. She sacrificed herself so that others could live. That doesn't go unnoticed. - Says who? - Says God. How do you know? I'm a minister. And God is watching over all of us. He has a plan. We just have to have faith. Amen. Enough, man. I'm sorry? With all due respect... That's just bullshit. Standing around there talking about faith when people are being blasted to shit left and right, that's fucking ridiculous. Hey, man. If there is a God, he doesn't give a shit about any of us! That's not true. Oh, my God. We're all dying in here. This shit's not gonna end until this motherfucker gets all of us, okay? So, you want to have faith in something? Have faith in this! Okay, because that's God in here now, all right? That's God right now in here. So pray to him, or ask him, even better? What does thou sayeth, God? Who among us will get to go to your divine kingdom? Hey. Take it easy. Or what? You're gonna fucking kill me because I have an opinion? It's just as valid as yours, man. Looking around this room, actually, I think I might have some friends. I think people agree with me. 95% of people believe in God. You're in the minority. Yeah, well, 95% of people are idiots. Are you calling us idiots? I'm not calling anybody idiots, all right? All I'm saying is this... if there is a God, is this something... does this seem like he Would allow this? Is this something he Would do? You fuckers are gonna kill me because You're afraid I'm right? What are you doing? You're fucking cowards, huh? Wait, please. I didn't even say anything wrong. He did. Who the fuck is this?! Looks like God just cut you a break. Yeah. For another two fucking minutes. Guys, I know this girl. Don't I know you? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know you from somewhere. - Me? - Yeah. Are you an actress? You are so familiar. No, I'm not an actress. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Stacy something. - No, Christina. - Christina. - Christina. - Yeah. Wait a minute. Is Stacy your stage name, then? No. I told you... I'm not an actress. That's what it is, right. Guys, actress, porn star... I get it now. It's a huge difference. What? I'm not a porn star. Hey, I don't think anybody cares around here, you know? I mean, I just couldn't figure it out before. Now I know. What? Whew. I'm a huge fan. What the fuck are you doing? I don't do porn. I don't think it's a problem. I think everybody's got to make a living. I don't have a problem with it. - I don't do porn. - All right, whatever. Hey, I'm just trying to pay her a compliment. He's lying. I got to be honest with you, you know? I did like you better, though, before your enhancements, because now, it's just like, "wha bam!" Look at these bad boys." He's lying. Are they real? That is none of your fucking business. - Are you saying they're real? - So what? Half the girls in L.A. have fake boobs. Yeah, and I'm sure it's great for business. - I don't do porn! - Who paid for them?! Tell them. Go ahead. Oh, it's okay, sweetheart. Who paid for them? - Was it your employer? - No. - No? - I-I mean, he did, but it's not like that. He did? No? Oh, now it's getting really difficult to decide. No, David is my boss, but We're also... I am not... ah, aha! You see, Stacy over here thought if she gets those double d's, oh, David's gonna love her. I mean, he's gonna love her way more than his own wife and kids. I mean, who cares if they're already a family? It's never stopped you before, has it? What, are you gonna run off with him? You're gonna have a bunch of kids on your own? Settle down by the beach? Is that what You're gonna do, Stacy? I think we should take into account if people have families, children. Why? How many kids do you have? - I have seven. - Of course you do. - Yeah, I got 12. - Yeah, I got 26. Oh, now, now, come on, seriously! Shouldn't that be taken into consideration? Yeah. Yeah, we have a daughter. Yeah. Emily. She's 3. We all got families. Yeah, your kids ain't gonna save you in here. Hey, and I'm not asking to be saved. I'm just saying... If you don't have children, maybe you should volunteer. I think that's reasonable. Yeah, well, maybe some of us want to have kids someday. - Yeah, well, I still am a kid. - Yeah, me, too. And I think that if you don't have children, you should do the right thing and step forward. How old are you? What, me? 35, but I have a kid. - Just one child? - Yeah, a daughter. - You married? - Yes. What does your husband do? I don't... uh... You don't what? Why the sudden interest in me? Well, We're all just being honest. I just thought I'd ask you a question. Well, I'm not on trial, so how about you tell us about your life? Easy... I'm 41. Uh, I've got two boys, an 18-month-old baby daughter. Married to the same amazing woman for 12 years. Um... That's it. Your turn. Shit. Still waiting. I raised my four younger siblings during my father's heroin addiction and my mother's clinical depression, then attended vassar under a work-study scholarship before serving in the peace corps for three years in Nepal, and then returned to the U.S., where I've worked for a non-profit ever since. Okay, but you still haven't answered my question. What does your husband do? I have a wife. Oh! So, You're a lesbian. Yeah, so, what? It doesn't make any difference. That's not necessarily true. Dude, so she's gay. Big deal... what's the matter? What, you think it's okay for a child to be raised with two gay moms? It's not fucking 1950, dude. Yeah, seriously. Mind your own business. What, you think it's okay to raise a baby girl in that environment? Two gay moms having sex all over the place? It's not as bad as two men, but it's still wrong. Maybe it's a good thing that You're here. You're gonna give that little girl a chance to have a normal life. Whoa, whoa. Come on, man. Where are you going with this? - I'm not homophobic or anything. - Yeah, right. Do you think that this is someone worth dying for? I know a lot of you are religious. This country was based on family values. This is a woman who has sinned. Doesn't that mean something? We've all sinned. Yes, but some more than others. I mean, maybe that's the whole point of this thing. Maybe if we figure out who the sinner is amongst us, that maybe this whole thing will end.
