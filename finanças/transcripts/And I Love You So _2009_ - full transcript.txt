On my 18th birthday... my brother Ricky and Dad told me... "Lara, you may accept suitors already... as long as you don't make anyone your boyfriend”. What they don't know... is that falling in love and having a boyfriend are not part of my plan. Faster. - Hurry up. - 1 will study. Until I graduate with honors and be a pre-school teacher just like Mom. Sit down. And then Oliver came into my life. Hey! Uhm.. I'm sorry I'm late. I had the hardest time finding the perfect gift for you. Audrey told me that you find chocolates and flowers lame. She also told me that you're an Education major so I got you these. I even read them just to make sure they're nice. This one's my favorite one. Aah...You want to be my friend? I'm sorry. What's this? Ehem. My sister has been pestering me for three weeks. She said that she won't pass class if 1 don't find you a date. So... here I am. I'm Oliver Cruz by the way. So would you go out on a date with me? I love you Dad. And now I'm orphan. Since then he became my family... and my world. What's that? Lara will you marry me? I love you. Where are we? Open your eyes. Oliver made my dreams come true. This is all yours. Thank you Oliver, you're welcome. Thank you. What kind of animal is this? Crocodile. What is it? Crocodile. Excuse me teacher Lara. Special delivery. Mr. Oliver! Come here. Oliver... Sorry. Thank you. Okay kids, are you ready to continue with the story now? Hahaha... Come here. Oliver... Here we are. Welcome home. I love you. I love you too. Our love is like a fairy tale. He made me fall in love with him, over and over. They said... that's the secret for a lasting marriage. What's this? Coin. It's a magic coin. Blow. Hmm... Watch. Hey! - Give me an applause. - Let me see, I'm sure you cheated me. No. Give it to me. Give it to me. . Give me that! I knew it. Your head hurts, right? Come here... stop that already. Honey, that feels good. By the way Honey, Mommy called last night. She's been asking... when we're finally giving her a grandchild. I said we"ll start now. Oliver! You said that? What? Why did you say that to Mommy? Come on. Hey... you're just acting out. Your head doesn't hurt. Come on. Oliver. Happy birthday! Honey. Make a wish. Nothing more can [ wish for. At 24, I already had what most people could only dream of all their lives. I already had Oliver, my one true love. So... What did you wish for? Just a simple wish. Honey, dance with me. Next time, promise. You know what, you're unfair. You didn't even dance with me on our wedding. Fine, it's okay... Honey. How's this? Is it like this? Honey? Honey! Honey! Help! Help! Help! I should've asked for more time with him. I should've asked for more time with him. We were husband and wife for only 5 months. That was not part of the plan. I haven't told him enough that I love him so much. I love him so... Morning, wake up honey! I love you. I always go back to that day. Could I have changed anything? Perhaps, he would still be alive. It's been eight years. And often times I still talk to him... even just in my mind. I miss him more everyday. I love him more everyday. He got sick for a year... but we had time to prepare. But at the final moment, I still wanted him to fight. I just couldn't let go. Even if I knew that my husband has been suffering. I had to be strong for my kids. I did not allow myself to cry... but two weeks after the funeral, I suddenly remembered Nelson. I could not stop crying. I had to stop the car... or my kids might also lose their mother. It's better to lose your husband first than to lose your son first. It's not right. My child should be the one to bury me. Hello Pau... Lara, my friend, how are you? I'm okay. Are you really ready to go back, my friend? No rush. The other classroom got burned. Joke. I know it's your first wedding anniversary. Are you okay? Hey! It's okay. Okay? Is that the sound of okay? I'm okay. Fine. Okay if you're okay. Just call me. Okay. I just think that someday we will see each other again. Mike, make sure you removed provision F in the contract. You're late. But sometimes, If I'm alone... So how was your birthday last week? How's Uncle Jun? And did you... Hey. Let's go out sometime. Oh no. Look, as your lawyer, I have to believe you. Okay! Hmmm. But as your cousin... as your cousin... I have doubts about you... Okay, look Chris... - you have to do this... - Do you realize how weird it is... to talk to some stranger about my wife? You should've just texted me. I just wasted gas. Never mind, you have a lot of dollars for gas anyway. Besides, you don't even answer my calls and messages. Hey, follow my advice. That's for your own good. Whatever. When... when their father died... I recovered because Oliver was there. But now, now that my son is gone... I don't know. It's much more painful. I'm sorry... I've been crying. My menopause even adds up to my sadness. You know... if it were up to me... you'd live here with us. Because, I feel that when I'm with you... it's like Oliver is here too. I love you Mom. I have to get back to work. Bro. It's your turn. Thank you, Bro. Thanks to all of you by the way. You're all still here. And sorry I wasn't able to come back last semester... but don't worry, I already fixed everything. We can do this. Of course! Right? - We can do this! - Of course we can! You can do this! You don't have trust with us. You'll still be taking over my class, right? When I give birth, right? Of course. Okay, great! I hope the baby would come out this July already. It's just so heavy. My back really aches! Hopefully you'd give birth tomorrow. What's that supposed to mean? You've been pregnant for so long. He'll be like a college student when he finally comes out. Teacher Lara... it's Mr. Chua. School is opening in two weeks. Are you excited? Excited. Where would I get the one million payment for the lease for this? I haven't paid for the condominium for six months too. You'll be able to fix things. You can do it. Oh no. Teacher is talking to herself again. Hey... shhh! Wake up! Chris, wake up! Jumbo! Mommy! Mommy! Chris is awake! Oh, wait. I'll just prepare Chris' breakfast. Hey, you woke up late again. I'll just prepare your food. Thanks, Aunt. Dad. Leche flan everyday. Dad I know what you're thinking. You don't like my new job, wasted what I studied. Hey eat first okay? You want me to go back to the old me. Happy, but stupid. Son, I understand why you're starting anew with your life. I'm just worried about your motorcycle. It's dangerous in the highway. Can't you just get a place that's nearer to the club? So you also won't tire yourself out, right? So, you're kicking me out of the house? Christopher, I didn't say anything like that. By the way, Rachel's mother came here. She wants to talk to you. You don't have to worry. I didn't tell her that you're staying here, that you're crashing here. Even if you're not kicking me out, I really have to find my own place already. It's up to you Chris... We're paying for the three kids' tuition fees. And my promotion was put on hold. But don't worry Lara, Jane and I will find a way... to pay you back what we owe you. What are you talking about? That's okay, you know? And you know I can't say no to my nephews and nieces. I planned to ask Ricky but... I know that they have money problems back in America too. By the way, what happened with your school? How's enrollment? There's a decline. Our former teacher has been competing with us. Are you ready to go back to school? I'm ready. I should. I need to. It'll be a shame if I didn't. Oliver invested on that school for me and then... I'm just thinking Lara. Don't you have any plans of renting out this unit? At least the rent can help you pay... for the lease of the school. Honey, Fred is right. You should've done this months ago. But I don't want anyone else to live here. Mr. Chua has already been asking for your payment for the lease of the school. I hope I won't find a tenant right away. You're the best Chris... Hey, it's your turn. My turn for what? It's your turn to say, “I'm the best!” Hmm. Who is it? It's Chris Panlilio. I'd like to look at your condo. It's fully furnished. There's one bedroom with one toilet and bath. There's also a toilet here in the living room. There's one maid's quarter. And there's also a fully functional kitchen. Thirty five thousand a month, inclusive of monthly dues. Three months deposit. Three months advance. Sounds reasonable. Mr. Panlilio I hope you don't mind. What's your work? I'm a DJ in this new club- Verve. Have you been there? Uhm... Uhmm... this condo actually has two units combined... that's why you can put up a division if you'd like another room. Subject to my approval of course. How many would live here? Umm... just me. You're the only one? You don't have a family? No wife? Kids? I lost my wife. No kids. Thank God. I'm sorry. I just lost my husband too last October. Aneuryism. It was sudden. Your wife... how did? I.. I'd rather not talk about it. I'm sorry. - You want to see the room? - No, I've decided. I'm taking it. Are you sure? Why? Do you have any other prospects? I'm so happy that you finally gave in to my request. Do you know? Audrey almost didn't accept her... company's offer for training in the States... since she thinks that I'll just be left here all by myself. Now you don't have to worry because Lara is already here. Go on, help yourselves. Eat. Mr. Panlilio. Hey, you're late too? I was just leaving. Sorry. You have the contract? You have a pen? Won't you even read it before you sign? Why? Is there fine print? No. I just want to make sure that you agree with all the terms and conditions. Well you seem like a reasonable person to me. Mr. Panlilio, I hope you won't change much... of the arrangement of the condominium. Is there a problem? You look better in jeans. I saw you here a few weeks ago. Look so out of place with all those other women. That's our grief support group for widowers. - Actually it's really Oliver's mom who... - Who's Oliver? Oliver is my husband. You mean was your husband. Past tense. Sorry. That's okay. Have you had breakfast? I'll treat you. No, I'm late for school. You're studying? No. I mean, I'm late for work. I run my own pre-school. Thank you Mr. Panlilio. Goodluck with the condo. Thank you. I'm sorry I have to go. Your helmet. It's okay, don't force him anymore. Try again later when he's ready okay? Hello, Lara. I've been waiting for you since awhile ago. Oh shit! Pardon me Mr. Chua. You're not the one I'm cursing. Of course. I already agreed that you give me partial payment for now... even if that's not what Oliver and I talked about. I can't let my business fail... just because my tenant's dead. Sorry Mr. Chua. My tenant forgot to pay his rent. I was supposed to use the money to pay you today. Aaaah! The baby's coming out! Teacher Lara! It's Teacher Grace! Emergency! I'll call the driver! What?? - Ouch! It hurts! - Teacher Grace, be careful. The car! Quick! It's coming out! Let's bring her to the hospital! I'm going crazy! To think it's just the first day of school. Freeze! Lara, Lara, If you won't be able to give anything by tomorrow... you better say goodbye to your school! You'll still be taking over my class, right? When I give birth, right? We can do this. Don't worry. I planned to ask Ricky but... I know that they have money problems back in America too. Lara, if you won't be able to give anything by tomorrow... you better say goodbye to your school! I know I have to stop... but it hurts so much. Honey, you can do it. I can't do this anymore. You can do it. You got to move on. Do it good for yourself. Wait... Hey... wait a minute... Do you think I'm cheap?! Shocks! Oops! Ouch! Good morning Mrs. Cruz. What are you doing here so early? Uhm... you forgot to give me your payment yesterday. Actually you forgot to get it. Hey, you look like you just woke up. You have morning crust right there. Did you sleep well last night? Huh? Don't you think it's a little too early for you to be doing business Mrs. Cruz? Unless... Unless? Unless you don't want to be late for school, or work, the school you work for. Right! Yes. That's what I thought. You're wearing the same thing. Is that your uniform? Uh-huh. Can I get the payment now? Sure. Thank you Mr. Panlilio. You're welcome. You want to come in and have some breakfast? Or coffee? No thank you, I'm late for school. My Friend. Hmm? You'll be proud of me. I finally agreed to marry Jet. Wow! I'm so happy for you. And next week we'll have our engagement party on his birthday... and you're invited. There you go again. You don't want to come again. You have to come! Come on! You have to do me a favor. Please... Come on, that's for my wedding. Okay... Okay! Give me your phone! I'll put it in your reminders so that you won't have any excuse. Give it, quick! That's the problem. I've been looking for it everywhere. Maybe, I left it in the condominium. Hmm. Hi! Come in. Uhm... I can just come back later. No no. Come in. What are you looking for again? Something important. I think I left it in your closet. Well, umm... You want some help? No it's okay. You might be doing something. Don't mind me. It's okay. I'm just here if you need anything. Okay. I'll be quick. Did you find what you're looking for? Ouch! Are you okay? Yeah... What are you looking for anyway? Mr. Panlilio, can I be honest with you? 1 did something stupid. I.. You... - 1. - slept here last night and you forgot this. You knew? And you made me go through all this trouble? You know Mr. Panlilio, - I never really planned to lie... - I get it. Sometimes we lie, because the truth hurts too much. More birthdays to come Dud! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! To Jet and Paula. May you stay happy together... forever and ever! Wait, hold on. No one should miss our wedding! That's on September. I'll expect all of you. Fine! Fine! Oh, kiss...kiss. What are you doing?! You're annoying! Why are you going home? Does your head really hurt? It's hard to control tears. It gives me headache. You need a drink. You know that I don't drink unless you're with me. I'll be with you. Come on. I hope I won't wake up tomorrow. It hurts so much already. It hurts so much. Suffering's an option. Happiness is a choice. Oliver, I try to be happy. I have to be okay, for your family, for Paula and the others. But it's hard. In school... I have to smile, I have to sing songs, I have to dance. I have to be happy for the kids. I have to teach the kids the truth... and the truth is, life is unfair. Life is so unfair. Yes, it may seem unfair... but I'm sure there's a reason why... God has a reason? The other widowers were able to spend a long time with their husbands. But me? Five months. Five months. What? What's the reason for that? I can't take this anymore. Oliver I don't want to live if you're not here with me. Babe, accompany me to the mall tomorrow, okay? What the heck? What's your problem? Let's go honey, let's go. Go ahead. I can't take it anymore... Are you okay? Do I look okay? My husband's gone. Lara, Lara, you okay? If 1 hear that question one more time, I swear I'd slap you. Is there a problem? Who's that? My landlady. Hey. Hey. Are you okay? No no wait. Lara wait. He's my first boyfriend. My first love. First boyfriend. Great love. You hate him for leaving you. And you want to suffer then... Why was he given to me if he'll be taken back so soon? Who knows? Death is a part of life. What kind of an F life is this? F? Hmm, pre-school teachers shouldn't curse. So even your curse should be an alphabet? You know, you should let it out. So you could release all your pains. Be angry! Curse all you want! Go ahead! Scream it out. Let it out. Go! Go Lara Cruz! Fuck you life! Aaah! I want to die! I miss Oliver! I love him so much... But you can't bring him back. He'll never return. You're both lucky your marriage ended with death. My marriage ended with... with the betrayal. Why? What happened? One day I went home. And I saw them. My wife... and her Ex. On our bed... No one has ever hurt me that badly. I wanted to kill them, I wanted to kill her. That's why even if she's still alive, in my head and in my heart... I already killed her. Oliver... Shit! Not again! Good morning! - What's in there? - Hey I read the contract. What ever I put in there is allowed. And your sister called. She wasn't too happy to talk to me. I wish you'd just leave my phone alone. And I wish you'd inform me... about the changes you've been doing here in my condo. I wish you'll inform me if you're going to sleep here. Do you even know how you got here? I found you in your car drinking yourself to death. Do I look suicidal? You kept on saying that you wanted to die. Is that bad? With the way you're talking it's as if your wife didn't die. Of course I want Oliver back. He's the best thing that ever happened to me. The best thing? How can he be the best thing that's ever happened to you? If all he's ever done is make you afraid of living your life without him? If you keep thinking that nothing beautiful will ever happen in your life anymore... because Oliver's gone, then expect yourself to be miserable all the time. Stop it. I'll stop when you stop acting like a pathetic victim. Wake up Lara Cruz. He's dead. You're not. Deal with it. I used to pity you. That was before. Your wife's lucky... because she doesn't have to suffer all her life... to be with a good for nothing person like you. Don't you dare change anything else in this house. Lara! Are you okay? Of course. Why? Were you and Mom worried about me? Paula's party ended late last night so I decided to just sleep there. Was Mommy worried? The Grief Support Group members invited her to go out of town with them. Remember? Oh that's right! I'm really so forgetful. I'll be waiting for your call. Okay. Mrs. Cruz. What are you doing here? I'm sorry Mr. Panlilio for... what I said the other day. All the things you said are true. How can I stop being a pathetic victim? Come here. Sit down. Cheers. Most people our age... they're just getting married now. But look at us... we have already buried our spouses. We still have a lifetime ahead of us... but we already lost the one person who was worth living for. You're worth living for. Don't you believe that? Come on. You can go on with your life without him. There must be something you do by yourself. Yes before I was a good teacher. Now I'm not sure. I'm sure there are also things you do with your wife before that... may seem weird now if you do it by yourself. Of course. Sex. Sorry. That's why I always try to bring a girl home... but you always manage to ruin my dates. You got a pen? What for? Think about all the things you can't do without Oliver. Things you never tried to do alone before. Hmmm. What? Eat alone in a restaurant? There. Write that. What else? Watch a movie. Okay, yeah. What else? Do that alone. I'll proved you. That your life can go on without Oliver. Hello. I look stupid here. Why don't you just come inside? You can do it. What will I order? Get the chicken fajitas. It's delicious. Oh okay. Thank you! Ticket Ma'am. What are you doing? Sun dance, sir... so that the rain won't pour. Why are you watching a love story without your boyfriend? Hey babe. - Sorry! - It's okay, okay. Didn't you see me? We're seated there. Come on. What? Nothing. Good evening. What's your order ma'am? Carrot cake please. Okay. Hey thanks. You accompanied me to be alone. Thank you. Oh no. These cars weren't here a while ago. Give me the keys. I'll do it I never had that problem before... since Oliver's the one who parks the car. Let's add that to your list. You should learn how to park your car. Wait, if I have to learn how to park... you have to be better with your Tagalog. Okay, if you'll be the one to teach me. Why not? Let's see who's the better teacher. Oh! You're challenging me! You still have icing on your face. Not there, on the other... remove it already. Is it gone? - Okay thank you. - Goodnight. Bye! Thanks! Hey... that's mine. It looks like you enjoyed yourself. I'm glad you found a friend. Thanks again for the cake. So you'll be okay? Yeah! Thanks too. Take care. You too. Are you ready? U-huh. Why don't you get inside? I might hit you. If you hit me... that means you're a bad student. Come on. Are you going to kill me? Sorry! Slow down. - Now go backwards. - Okay. It should be here. This side. At the right, right. It should be here. Come on. Sorry! Ill do it. This is the right way to do it . After here. And then backward. Good teacher. Bad driver. No. Good driver. Really bad teacher. Thanks for the workout. Teacher Lara... what's that? Tongue twister. Oh just like... “purple paper purple paper purple paper” Yes that's it. Tongue twister? Purple paper. You're right. But you know what suits you more? Try “pizza, pasta”. - Pizza pasta. - Pizza pasta. That suits you more! Teacher. She sells sea shells by the sea shore. She sells sea shells by the sea shore. - She sells sea shells by the sea shore. - She sells sea shells by the sea shore. - Ha ha ha. - Wait, wait! - She sells sea... shells by the sea shore. - Ha ha ha ha. - She sells sea shells...by the sea shore. - She sells sea... shells by the sea shore. Hello. She sells sea shells by the sea shore. She sells sea shells by the sea shore. She sells sea shells by the sea shore. I'm good right? Fine! You're good. Wait I have to go, I'm cooking. - Okay, bye! - She sells sea shells by the sea shore. Bye! Who's that? A friend Mom. Are you courting your landlady? They were actually looking for Oliver... since he's their favorite customer. You know there was this one time... when Oliver came to the defense of a saleslady. There was a drunk customer who entered the store... and Oliver naturally got mad because... 1 didn't ask about Oliver. I asked about you. If you're okay after your visit to the store. I'm okay! Oh you'll be proud of me... because I managed to control my tears. You have some paint on your neck. Thank you. Oh I bought you something. Wait. You know when I first saw this... I remembered you right away. It's a Magic eight ball! Do you know this? You always have an answer to all questions... so just in case you don't know the answer, here it is. Just ask it. Shake it then the answer will pop out. Here, try it. Okay. Does Lara like my music studio? - Yes! - Yes! My turn. Uhmmm... will Oliver be happy about the way... Chris is renovating our room? My reply is no. I don't care. - Wait, one more time. - No I'll ask first. - I'll ask the question again. - Let me... wait. Me first... Fine, you go ahead. Do you like water? I'll just go get some water. The word grapes starts with the letter? G!!! Very good. Please go back to your seat. You know what else starts with the letter G? What? Good-looking. It's guitar. He will sing. What will you play, Teacher Chris? Can I play Teacher Lara's favorite song? Okay. And I love you so People ask me how How 1 live till now I tell them I don't know And yes I know How lonely life can be The shadows follow me And the night won't set me free But I don't let the evening let me down Now that you're around me. You look good together. And I saw your smile a while ago. Admit it! Aah! Teacher, should I be guilty? What? Am I cheating on my husband? What are you talking about? I don't mean to be insensitive but how will you cheat on your husband... when you don't have a husband anymore? One step at a time, teacher Lara. I'm sure Oliver would want you to be happy. You want that, right? Huh? He said yes. Yes! Chris! Chris! You see that? I was able to park! - 1 was able to park! - Yes! You're great! I'm so proud of you. Uhm... Chris, can you put me down now? I'm hungry. Come on, I know a good place. I feel like Oliver lived because he had to take care of me. Give that to me. Maybe so that I'd learn how to take care of myself too... and how to take care of others. All the more I realize why he is my one great love. Al ever hear you talk about is the goodness of St. Oliver. Ahh really? Alright, let's just talk about your wife then. Look, answer my question first. Did St. Oliver have any imperfections? Hhmm... He doesn't know how to dance. That doesn't count. You never even fought? He never broke your heart? Not even once? Well once. Just once. When? He broke my heart... the day his heart stopped beating. He's human then. I'm just kidding. Hey wait... - what do you think you're doing? - Audrey... that's your sister-in-law, right? Lara? Is that her boyfriend? He's cute! In fairness. They look good together. Why did you decline the offer? If you're still worried about me, you don't have to. Lara's already here. We don't even know how long she'll stay here. What if she marries again? Audrey, you know how much she loves Oliver. And besides a year hasn't even passed yet ever since... Exactly. Okay Mom, reality check. She only promised “till death do us part” to brother Oliver. Not to me and not to you. 1 just don't want that- .. Hi, Mom. Good morning! Good morning! Good morning Mom! Audrey! I'll go ahead Mom. Aren't you eating anymore? No. I'm already late. Mom, is Audrey okay? Cheers! Hi! - Hello! - MJ... meet Lara. Chris, you take care of things here okay. I'll just join the party outside. I'm so ready to party! Ow! He he! Alright MJ, have fun! You know Oliver likes music too but music doesn't like him. Now I don't feel so insecure. Insecure? What? Nothing. You're going to Zambales this weekend. It's your first out of town trip alone. What? Chris, hold on, what? To Anawangin Cove. They have beautiful beaches there. - Lots of pine trees. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Why will 1 go there? And why this weekend? Because I already bought your bus ticket? Why are you rushing me? Why are you always delaying? Hey. That's mine. The world is moving on without you, Lara. C"mon, let's dance. Chris! Chris, what's with you? Are you sure you want to dance with me? The last person I danced died. On my birthday. I'm sorry he died on your birthday. I don't even know what to celebrate on October. If it would be Oliver's first death anniversary... or my 25 birthday. Your birthday of course... because who is left behind is more important... than the one who left. The living than the dead. The one who still breathes... and can still love. The one who should still be loved. 1 will offer to you. I'd pick the stars... so I could wish to have your heart. If that's possible, if that can happen, if the world was mine, all of this 1 will offer to you. Oooh. Oooh. Oooh. Oooh. I'd pick the stars so I could wish to have your heart. If that's possible, if that can happen, if the world was mine, all of this, all of this, all of this... I will offer to you. Oooh. - Oooh. - So, I'll take you home? - Oooh. - No, I have the pick-up. Alright bye. Don't forget your Anawangin trip okay? Don't back out. Okay fine! Alright. Good night. Good night. Bye. Drive safely. I'm here. 1 did it. What are you doing here? Uhm, I just wanted to make sure that you made it here safely. That you didn't back out, you know? It's good that you made it here. I can go. Yeah, I'm going. I'm really proud of you by the way. Very proud. Okay, thank you. Whew! It's very tiring. I had cramps a while ago in the bus... then I bumped my head in the tricycle. That's what you get for not trusting me. Okay, look I deserve it. What time is it anyway? It will probably be dark when I get to the bus station. What time will I even arrive in Manila? So you'll just leave tomorrow? That's a good idea. Wooh! Yes! Wooh! Yes! Wooh hoh! I've already seen you sleeping, newly awake, angry, drunk, stressed out, and now you just took a bath. No matter what you do... you're always gorgeous. You know you can still make it to the last bus trip to Manila. It's still early. You can leave now. Wait... - I'll just set-up the bonfire for you. - No need. I can do that myself. Stay here. I'll take care of it. I'm supposed to be alone on this trip, right? After that you'll leave, okay? Here, you can have the sandwich. I brought food. Sorry it's a bit deformed but it's delicious. Thank you. Let's share? No. You can have it. Doesn't Lara want me here... that's why she's grouchy? My sources say no. The magic eight ball says that you're glad that I'm here. Does Lara think I'm cute? Whoa! Such confidence! Yes definitely. You're not cute. You're just annoying. Will Lara fall in love again? As I see it yes. Why are all the questions just about me? Okay, you try. Is Chris crazy? Yes! Is Chris a good friend? Definitely? If Oliver were still alive, will he and Chris be friends? Don't count on it. You think you won't get along with Oliver? Why not? Because I'd hate him. I'd hate him because he'd be perfect. Because you met him first. Because you married him. And I so want to be married to you. I want to do something. If 1 do that, will Lara get mad? No. Stop pushing me away. I promise this will just take a short while. I just have to show you the music room... so that if you have any objections, you can just tell me. Sir Chris, Ms. Cruz. Sir, someone was looking for you a while ago. She said she'll be back. Tell her I moved out already. Sir... Rachel Panlilio. She said she's your wife. Chris... Lara! Chris, can we talk? Lara. Lara. Lara wait. Lara. Lara, let me ex... Lara please. Will you let me explain? Why didn't you tell me? I didn't mean to lie. I told you before but you were too drunk to remember. So it's my fault? How dare you? Don't you think I've suffered enough? You fooled me. You made me look stupid. You made me believe that we're the same. We're the same Lara. Yours died. Mine I left because she cheated on me. You're no different from her! Look it's over! It's been over between us before I even met you. Lara! Get away of me. Lara, I want to be with you... Is she no longer your wife? I don't love her anymore. Is she no longer your wife? I trusted you... but you took advantage of me. And you know what hurts the most? I allowed you. Lara. Lara. Lara please. Lara please. Lara please. Lara. Lara! Lara wait. Lara wait. Lara! I'm sorry. My client is willing to let her have the house. Not that he'd want it... after everything that happened. That's a fairly generous offer don't you think? But the trust fund came from his American grandparents. Therefore it's only fair that your client won't receive any share from that fund. I don't want an annulment. I don't want a divorce... but I know that's where we're headed. Chris I'm so sorry. I.. Your apology's a little too late. Can't you ever forgive me? I know I made a mistake once but... Once? When I caught you that was the one and only time you betrayed me? Once? Yes Chris it was only once. So it was just sex? It wasn't just sex... that's why I can't forgive you. When I asked you to marry me, you said you didn't love him anymore. I'm the only one you should love. Just me. Our whole relationship, our whole marriage was based on a lie. And you know what really hurts? I don't think you even loved me. Chris. What do you think of me? A liar just like you? Her car's here. Oh... it's broken. That's why she parked it here. Believe me I didn't mean to... Even if you didn't mean it my friend still got hurt. You have no idea what she had to go through... and what she's going through right now. That's why you don't have any right to play with her feelings. Bye-bye Teacher Paula. - Bye! - We have to go Ma'am! Will you just please tell her I'm really sorry? Pl try. Guard, close the gate. The kids are in danger. Teacher Lara I learned a new dance step. Maybe we can teach it to the kids. It's like this. One two three four five six seven eight. One two three four five six seven eight. What are you doing? - One two three four five six seven eight. - Have you had yourself checked up? I'm just trying to cheer up Teacher Lara. Hey, he said sorry. No he said, “I'm sorry”. Yehey! I'll recite a poem. The title is “Me”. Ssshh. Teacher Chris! The New Filipino. - Where's teacher Lara? - Okay! She's there! Come with me okay? - Let's go with them. - A collateral? Like that! Do I have that? Hmmm... Land... like that? Come on run! - Where can I get that? - Teacher Lara! Teacher Lara! - Someone looking for you! - Wait! Didn't I tell you that you couldn't talk to Lara? Lara! Lara's not here. Lara please let me... I said Lara's not here. - Lara, I just... Paula! - Lara's not here! I'm sorry Look, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I know you're still angry... but I have no plans of going back to her. I stopped loving her a long time ago. I don't want to go back. I want to be with you. - Lara - Lara - Lara please. Lara please let me... - Please let her go. Chris, can you please let her go? - Lara please. - Wait! Stop it! Paula I need to talk to her. Can you do it some other time? She doesn't want to talk to you now. Lara, stop the car! We need to talk. Are you trying to kill yourself?! Why not?! Maybe you'd care more about me if I die! Stop it! No! I love you. Don't you get it? I love you. Please stop it. I beg you. Please let me love you. I'll love you more than anybody's ever loved you. I'll take care of you until we're both old. If you want, I'll make sure I won't die before you do. I will live for you, Lara. Just say that you love me too. I don't want to. I don't want to forget my husband. Chris you make me so happy that I forget him. I forget how much I love him. You don't want to be happy? You'd rather be miserable? Just so you won't forget him? If that's the only way I can hold on to him then... Look, he's dead. He's gone. If you stop loving him, do you think it would matter to him? It matters to me. Love me or lose me, Lara. She still loves him. I'm so tired. No matter what I do I always come in second. I'm always on the losing end. Why do you always come home late? Good evening mom. You haven't been attending our Grief Support meetings seither. I'm sorry. Sometimes, I want to believe what Audrey said, that you've already found a replacement for my son. I could never replace your son. Why don't I believe you? It's so easy for you. Maybe because you were only married for five months. Yes we only had five months... but if it was up to me, I'd want him to live longer. Even for just five minutes more. If I could, I would have five more days, five more years, five more lifetimes with him. You may have loved him longer... but that doesn't mean I loved him any less. I loved him for as much as I could... until his very last breath, and until now... I still love him. Until when will you wear my watch? It's almost my birthday. Aren't you going home yet? I don't want to yet. Why? I can't take it anymore. I'm tired. I'm tired of being sad. But I can't be happy too because I'll hurt other people. But Lara I want you to be happy. You want me to be happy? Yes. I want you to find a good husband. I want you to have many kids, because I know you'll be a good mom. You want me to fulfill our dreams without you? You want me to be happy? How will I be happy? You died! You left me! You broke my heart! I never thought I'd hate you this much but I hate you. I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you... I hate you. I hate you so much... because you're never coming back, because you can't love me anymore, because until now I still love you so much. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I want to love someone else, but how will I do that... if you're very much alive in my heart? In time Honey. In time you'll learn to let me go. Is this still your favorite? I wasn't sure. You've changed a lot. Your look, your work. And now you ride the motorcycle too. What's wrong with me? Chris. It's my fault. 1 told you before that I had no feelings for Paolo anymore, that I was okay even if I really wasn't. I told you that I loved you... because I didn't want to lose you... but I still lost you in the end. Did I rush you? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I expected too much too soon. I'm sorry too that I hurt you. Believe it or not, I did love you. Probably just not with my whole heart. And that... And that is my biggest regret. Mom, I'll just attend Paula's wedding. I might be back around 10 pm. Mom... Mom, I'm sorry. I'm sorry because no matter how much I love Oliver... I can never bring him back to life. I'm sorry because Oliver died... and I lived. I'm sorry because... I'm looking for reasons to live everyday... because it hurts. I'm sorry because it hurts. I'm sorry because everything hurts. I'm sorry... because I want to lessen the pain I'm feeling. I'm sorry because I want to be happy again even just... even just a little, just for a while. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'll just talk to Chris. Follow right away. Okay. You take care. Congratulations! Thank you. - Okay. - Bye! - Bye! - Bye teacher Paula! I wasn't sure so... I asked the magic eight ball... if 1 should let you go. The answer was always yes. You're the worst possible girl to love... but I love you... even if you still love Oliver. I'm sorry. I don't want to be second place in your heart... because you're first place in mine. I don't want you to think that... you're only second to Oliver, that you're just a replacement for him. I want to give you a space in my heart... that solely belongs to you. But I don't want us to be together just because... just because you're able to give me the happiness that I need right now. I want us to be together... simply because I love you... and that's the only reason why I need you in my life. I don't want you to think that I can't love you... because I thought that I could never love again. It's harder not to fall in love, especially with you. But I want to love you... the way I loved Oliver. I want to love you completely... but my heart is broken right now... and I need to fix it. I need time to do that. I'm so afraid to let you go... because what if the right time... never comes for us? I want to think that if this is right, if we're really right for each other, then there's a right time for the two of us. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for coming into my life. Mike said that you don't have to attend the other hearings. But be ready because they may just call you anytime. How long will you be in the States? When are you coming back? When I'm okay. When is that? I don't know. When Oliver died, 1 felt like I died too. Bye! - But even if it was hard, - Thank you Mommy. Take care! I tried to go on with my life. Hello Lara. All the paperworks are there, and here's the car key. June. Yes? So I guess our lease is already covered for the next two years right? Of course! Alright, thank you Lara. Alright Mr. Chua. Thanks again. ! needed to go on with my life... for all the people who love me. He rushed to leave again. He didn't get this! It's free. Here! Ma'am, Mr. Panlilio left this. Thanks. And also this. My mistake is that... Thank you Ma'am. I went on with my life... but I didn't accept that everything has changed... and that I had to change too. Mrs. Cruz? - Good morning Mrs. Quiambao. - Hi! Are you ready to see the unit? - Yes, sure! - Hi little girl. Hello! Let's go. Okay! I now have to be willing to let go of the life I planned with Oliver... so that I can have the life that is waiting for me. I had to let go of all the pain I felt when Oliver died, even all my fears... when he left me all by myself. Are you ready? I know you'll always love me... but you have to let me go. Happy birthday Lara. I love you. Happy birthday to me. Oliver and I loved each other... and even if that love didn't last, it should make us all believe that we can all be happy again, that 1 can be happy again and that one day... all the wounds will heal... Thank you Mom! - Happy birthday! - here in my heart. Happy birthday, Lara! What if I only thought that I'm ready... but I'm actually not? - Excuse me... - Yes sure. What are you talking about? It's been two years. Even the Cruz family... approved your date with John. Come on. And your date's cute you know! As in. Come here now! You better come here now! Fine! Am I doing the right thing? Yes. Should I go down now? Yes definitely. Reply hazy. Hi. - Yehey! - Hey! Hello. You're right on time. Where's Chris? I saw the albums already. Chris is here? Yeah, he was just here. You're not together? Was he here just now or way earlier? I think... there he is. Chris! Chris! Chris! My role is to coordinate Lara's date. Really. Where is... Lara? Excuse me for a while. Lara! Lara! - Here is the place! - Quick! - Quick! Quick! - What do you mean quick? Why? Where are you going? Bye Jonathan! Lara, wait. - Where are you going? - I'm sure you're a decent person... but you see I'm in love with someone else. I've been in love with him for so long. Don't tell me you're talking about Oliver again! Chris is here! I really have to go! - Bye! - Really? Go Lara go! Go Lara! Go go go! Chris! Chris! Chris? Lara? Mike. I'm the cousin of Chris. Are you looking for Chris? You're just in time. Hey Chris! It's Lara! Hi. Just a minute. Hey! Hey, how are you? Good. Is Lara happy to see me? Sign points to yes. Why are you barefoot? Hmm? Oh that's right. Okay I have to go. Hey your wife is waiting. Nice to see you. Bye! Wait Lara. Lara. Lara, Lara. Hey! Chris! Chris what's gotten into you? - What are you doing?! - You should put on some shoes! It's embarassing. Your wife's there! Wife? Leanne? She's Mike's wife. Chris we have to go! You don't have a wife? My annulment was granted three months ago. I'm not married. Not anymore. Stop laughing. No sorry, I just feel stupid. Stop laughing... because it makes me want to kiss you. I don't want to do that... if you still need more time. I need more time. I want more time. To be with you. To love you. I love you. You love... me? Yes... you. Chris Panlilio. You who ruined my condo. You who taught me how to park. You who made me run barefoot. You who are here right now. You that I still want to love. You made me wait a long time... but it was so worth it. I love you.
