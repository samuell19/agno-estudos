George Washington was a bitch. Hey, guys, can we not degrade the president, the first president of the United States? Like a straight up bitch. Miguel, language. Sorry, Mr. Dunbar. All right, you obviously have pretty strong views on Washington, as you should, as you have a right to. Can someone share their thoughts on that? Slaves, duh. Slaves, good. Slaves are good? Miguel, I obviously wasn't saying that slavery was good. Go ahead, Sadie. What? You were talking about Washington. Oh, well, I mean, he had slaves, and I mean, yeah, he did all these great things like he killed British people and he made more dirt roads or whatever, but slaves cut down the trees to make the roads. He didn't pay them. And that's deforestation, like the rainforests in Brazil. It's really bad. Didn't he also bang a few of his slaves? No, that was John F. Kennedy. That wasn't JF... Guys, I think, I think if we can look at Washington through the prism of being a fallible human, like a lot of our historical figures, they weren't superheroes. These were people. They were, they were messy and they were complicated, but I think if we look at his accomplishments with his flaws, I think that we can all relate to Washington a little more. I don't know. Still seems like a bitch. All right, let's wrap it up, okay? Do me a favor, get your essays in my Dropbox tomorrow by-00 PM or I'm docking you guys 10 points per day, okay? Bye-bye. - Sorry I'm late. - Hey, it's okay. You texted me. It's fine. I had a meeting run over. My boss was rambling, so. It's okay. Thank you for bringing her. Hi, Daddy! Hi, baby! She's with me all day now. - Yeah? - Because of preschool, yeah. What happened? Did they quarantine? No, precautionary for a couple of weeks till the numbers go down, which is fine. Oh. Look, we're violating the order by me even being here, but I know you'd wanna see her, so now you've seen her. Well, thank you. Uh, I'm keeping their original, but the lawyer says the court copy is just fine for... Where is your mask? It's in the car. Did you wanna put it on? Not really. I'm in my apartment all day teaching. I don't go anywhere. Still, the optics matter. People see you. Okay, well, I'll take that under advisement. You look really good. I mean, your eyes do, your forehead. You got a haircut. I can tell that. How has teaching been? Um, it's been all right. Challenging. I'm getting through it. Oh, hey, come here for a second. I brought you this. You left it when you picked up your last few boxes. Well, I can't fit in my car. Can you disassemble it? I can, not fast. I can just bring it by. No. I don't even have to come inside if you- No, it's not a good idea. Why isn't it a good idea? You know why. So is he like, is he parked in my space? No, he is parked in what is now my extra space. You call the therapist yet? Fuck you, Kim. Nice. Nice, you know what? - Hmm? - Keep the bike, sell it. Whatever you want. Thanks. That's it, then. Say bye to Daddy. Bye, baby. I love you. I love you. What are you doing? Mm, well, there was an outbreak on campus. They sent us all home. Well, you have to get tested. No, it was a night custodian. All of us in the counseling office aren't on his rotation. So what did they do with the school? They wanna play it safe, so they shut it down. It's gonna be a ghost town for at least a few weeks. It looks like you're stuck with me. Oh, the horror. I've got two more bags in the car. Mind taking a break from your busy studies and grabbing them? I gotcha. Ah! Yeah. Hello? Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm fine, just having some technical issues over here. I'm logging on now. Yeah. Fuck. Huh? No, no, no, I'm... I, uh, I understand that the parents are calling you nonstop right now, I get it. I also understand that you have better things to be doing during a pandemic. I'm not fucking stupid. Listen, the last time I checked, I'm a, I was a history teacher, not a fucking IT guy, okay? I'm doing the best that I can here. If it's not good enough for you, you call my union rep. Hey everybody, sorry. I'm sorry that I'm late. Um, a little technical issue. Uh, let's turn to page 248. Gee, you want tech support, motherfucker, huh? Yeah? Did you reboot it? Did you, did you restart it? Did you fucking restart it, huh? I fucking wanna get COVID. I'm serious. I'll kick its ass. It's the invisibles diatribe again? I am, I placed third in the last MMA tournament, in case anyone forgot. Yeah, you're a black belt in douchebag. Every night before I fall asleep, I seriously think why don't break up with you. I bet that's not all you think about in bed. Ugh. Thanks for getting my burger. I'll get you back next time. It's fine. Don't worry about it. Aah, I'm gonna fucking die of boredom before I die of COVID. You know what we should do? Throw a party, get fucked up. Where? Everyone's home, parents too. There's the old warehouse on 18th. It has a security guard. How do you know? I take walks with my mom at night. I always see a security guard out there texting. What other buildings are empty 'cause of COVID? Schools. Yeah, but schools have like maintenance men there. Actually, no, they don't. At least not ours. They shut it down. What are you talking about? My mom said some janitor caught the virus, so they're not take any chances. So what, is totally empty? It's school, guys. It's not a rave venue. That's why it's perfect. If there was just an outbreak there, then no one's gonna go near that place for at least a few days. This shit's like radioactive. That's hardly a compelling argument for us to go ourselves. Trevor, did you sell your paintball guns yet? Not yet. There we go! We'll get drunk and tag up the school with pellets. That's stupid. Oh, come on. They closed the paintball park since the pandemic. I know you miss going. It's like the only loser thing you're good at. Thanks pal. I mean, you have to impress Sadie with something. Don't be an asshole. No, I, I think it could be fun. We should do it. I don't know. My mom works in the counseling office. It could mess with her job if we get caught. We're not gonna get caught. And if someone shows up, we'll just go out a side door or something. We can outrun any old-ass janitor, right? Now, I know you're in. Are you in? Only if Trevor is in. This pussy's in. Hey! Sorry! Hey, why aren't you wearing your masks? We're good, bro. It's just like study pods, a little herd immunity here. You should wear your masks. I'm safe, dog. I promise. I wear a condom at least like half the time. You're gonna get your ass kicked one of these days with that mouth! We're teenagers. We're invincible. I'm just saying, if the British didn't have guns and the Americans didn't have guns, then the militia wouldn't have needed guns. Right? I totally agree, but they did. I mean, those are the origins of the Second Amendment. Well, it's ridiculous. I'm sorry. I don't know. No, don't say that. I like it, I like it when you open up with your thoughts like that, it's, uh, it's refreshing, it's refreshing and charming. So I think, I think the argument with guns is that they were a natural right for citizens, for them to be able to protect themselves, to feel safe, to feel like they have some sort of control of their future. Do you own one? I don't think my, uh, my feelings or my hobbies should intermingle with our class discussions. That's a yes. I think the amendment was to protect citizens from everyone. You know, governments, governments were not always honest and the most well-intentioned with their countrymen. Hello? Gender-neutral. Country-people, please. Country-people. Thank you, Genesis. I don't know. Stop saying you don't know. Tell us what you think. I just don't wanna get shot, right? One thing about the pandemic, at least you don't have to hear about a school getting shot up every month. That's one thing you don't have to worry about. That's a good point. That is a good point. You know, I don't always agree with your opinions, but they're, they're always really well thought out, they're, they're salient. All right, should we head to our breakout boxes now? What about-00 PM? Later, my dad will be downstairs until at least 30 watching TV. Sadie, can you come over? Yeah, my aunt's cool with it. I'll be there around six. Trevor, you good for tomorrow night? Yeah. You gonna bring the paintball guns? I'll bring 'em, dog. And what about your mom's key? What do you mean? Well, we're not gonna break windows to get into the school to play paintball. We need your key. Dude. Come on, man. Don't pressure him. Look. It's fine. I'll get 'em. I'll get 'em. I mean, if you can't, we can always get Sadie to blow Mr. Dunbar for his set. Miguel! You're a pig. That is so not cool you said that. Whatever, he's always like, "Sadie, please go on." Sadie, please, we wanna hear what you have to say. Sadie, when school starts, can you wear a shorter skirt so I can try "and catch a glimpse of your panties?" You're inappropriate. And disgusting. I'm joking. Right, Trevor? Don't involve me. You're an asshole. I'm sorry. I'm joking. I'm joking, Sades, but not about him. The dude's a fucking weirdo who certainly jacks off to what you look like clothed, much less naked. Okay, you need to stop. Oh, he's not a creep? He's gross, but that's not the point. The point is you're being a dick, and you need to stop. - His wife left him. - What? Yeah, my mom told me he's going through a divorce. I guess he's got rage issues. I mean, we never knew 'cause we didn't have a class with him, but supposedly he went nuts on a teacher's aid that came in high last year. Are you serious? But what did dumb-ass Dunbar do? I don't know. I know he got written up for it. I think the charge is still pending, though. There it is. The dude's a fucking psycho. Mystery solved. - Don't be- - What? No, Sadie. Please continue. I'm just saying he seems okay. He's just sad. We all go through hard times sometimes. Oh, you wanna fuck him? Miguel, I'm dead serious, you want a hand job before summer break, it's gonna be a miracle. Fine. Next up, please. Really? You know what? You're right, Miguel. Fuck that fool, man. That's what I'm saying. No, fuck how he talks to Sadie. It's messed up. I don't give a damn that he's having marital problems. Maybe his wife left his loser ass because she knows he like to fuck with the students. Don't be a creep and shit won't happen like that. It's karma. Heard that. Yeah, he's fucking creepy. You know, if we go back to school, I might just lie and say he touched me if he makes me feel uncomfortable. Whoa, you guys are more coldblooded than me. Damn! What the fuck is this? Oh, come on, dude. Really? Dude, come on man. Move over. What the fuck, dude? Seriously, man. Fucking move over. What the fuck, man? Dude, what the fuck, man? Pedestrians have the right of way. Oh yeah, you gonna fucking hit my car, you fucking pedestrian? Really? Okay. I'm sorry that I hit your car, okay? Yeah, yeah, you are fucking sorry, man. I'm fucking jogging because I'm a little stressed out. Right, listen, I don't give a shit about your stress. You don't hit my car, you understand? I understand, yeah. What the fuck? Dude! - Fuck you, shithead! - Fuck you! Dude, what the fuck? - Fuck you, Florida bitch! - What the f- - Oh, oh, oh shit. What are you fucking- - Hey. Listen, Nobody's gonna fucking come here and help you, okay? So, you go fuck yourself. Mr. Dunbar? Sorry. What do you think? About what? The internet connection was, uh, was not great. I didn't, I didn't hear what you said. I was talking about when Washington died, the dilemma the country was in. What dilemma? I mean, I don't know. Don't say you don't know, Sadie. Come on. Tell us, tell us what you think. It seems he was a soldier at heart. Maybe not the smartest guy in the room, but the most capable. I mean, maybe that's what it takes to be a strong leader. He never thought that he was smarter than he was. He seemed grateful, even simple. Grateful for what? For the hope of what things could be for the country. So you're saying that he knew his place in history? Exactly, he died knowing he made his mark. His hubris wasn't such that he needed to be king. Yeah, yeah. I totally agree with that. All right, that's enough. Thank you. Thank you, Sadie. And everyone have a good weekend. That a way, that a way, that a way, that a way, that a way! You gonna get that? It's your door. Really? Okay. All right, don't do it. Just sit there. I'm watching the game, dammit. Yeah? Yeah? Hello? Is everything okay? No, not at all. Go inside. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I kinda miss this place. Wait, the lights are on. Trevor, are you sure no one's here? Um, that's what my mom said. - See something? That's- - Guys- - That's, that's a cart. - Guys. - Let's go. Go, go. - Sh, sh. What are you doing? He'll move back around. We don't have time to run. Come on! - Fuck. - Come on! - Fuck. - Come o- - Okay. Sorry. Wasn't how you envisioned it, huh? - Let's go. - Okay. It's so quiet. Spooky quiet. Have you guys been here when it's empty? Only once with my mom, so. Hey guys, why are we whispering? - Sh! - Dude! I can't hear you bro, what? - Oh, my god. - Sh! - Sh! - Sh! - Cock! - Dude! Cock, fuck, big, hairy nutsack, queef! - Sh! - Shut the fuck up! - Sh! - Don't sh me. Fine, because no one's here. No one's here, are you? Dude! Is anyone here? ♪ Here ♪ I don't think anyone is here. We're all alone, motherfuckers! I think we run this bitch! Yes! - Yeah! - Whoo! - Whoo! - Whoo! Yeah! - Whoo! - Ah! Ah, ah, ah. Ah. Get up! And then that little rat-faced sophomore had the nerve to tell me, the best actress that they have in drama club, that I was stepping on her lines. I mean, I'm the goddamn lead. I can step on your lines if I want to, cunt. Ugh. I'm totally with you, baby. You're the star. Such a good listener. Oop! Does that mean we can have sex tonight? You know what we haven't done? I can guess. Can you? Are we talking around the parameters of an orgy? Gross. Do not include me. We have never taken a shower together. You need a refill? I've still got three-fourths of a cup. I, I wasn't trying to get you drunk Is it bad if I say I'm disappointed? Dude, did I ever tell you guys the time that I cut oceanography and snuck in here to catch a glimpse of fifth-period girls changing? There are so many hot girls in fifth period, right, right? Okay, so anyway, it was like raining that day so no one got dressed. So I'm like hiding in here waiting and no one shows up. But then when I try and leave, Ms. Bishop comes in to use the PE coaches bathroom. And I'm like, "Okay, what can I do now?" Maybe I can catch a glimpse of her vag, right?" But then, all I end up doing is smelling our Spanish teacher's shit. Did I ever tell you guys that story? What? Okay. Okay, I get it. You know what? It's not the size of the whale, it's the speed of the dolphin. What? You know what I'm talking about? - No, I don't. - You're crazy. - Yeah, you do. - No, I don't. - Yeah, you do. - Bye! You were saying? Was I? I don't even know. Cheers. To dolphins. No. What? Did you guys know that I was Lady Macbeth in 8th grade? The school let us use this stage for our opening night. Do you remember it? That night? No, her monologue. Hmm, some of it. Hmm. You should perform it for us. - Here? - Yeah. No. - Come on. - Come on. - Please. I wanna see it. - Me too. No. - Come on. I wanna hear it. - Come on. Please? Come on. Genesis, Genesis, Genesis, Genesis, Genesis, whoo! Let's get it. Come to my women's breasts and take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers. Wherever in your sightless substances, you wait on nature's mischief. Come, thick night, and pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell that my keen knife see not the wound it makes, nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark, to cry... Fuck you, Miguel! I thought I was good. And turn that light off, you idiot. Miguel! You're an asshole. Why am I an asshole? So good. Really, really impressive. Trevor, I wouldn't run if I were you. I've already seen your faces. Plus, I know you guys, so, uh, I'm pretty sure I could give a pretty detailed description of who you are to the police. Oh, sorry. Hold on. Okay. Fuck! Goddammit. God! Turn around. Oh, that's a good one. Oh, that's good. See this, this, school's not gonna think that I doctored these. All right. How are you guys doing? You good? Okay, the only other question that I have for you is, do you have pellets for this? What? You guys don't want me to play? - Are you serious, Mr. Dunbar? - I'm totally serious. This is gonna be fun. I'm not gonna turn you guys in. I swear I'm not. That's not, that's not the kind of person that I am. I won't. What do you, what do you wanna do? I just wanna play. That's all I wanna do. I just wanna play. Come on, what do you guys think, you were the only ones that were bored out of your minds at home during this fucking pandemic? Let's do this. Okay, so let's get these all loaded up. We'll do two teams. We'll start at different positions at the school. Trevor, these are all your guns? Yeah. How often do you play? I have a season pass to Paint World. I'm sorry, you have a season passed to what? I have a season pass to Paint World. You have a season pass to Paint World. Wow. And you lay in bed at night wondering why you're struggling with girls. - Oh, shit. - I'm kidding. I'm just busting your balls. But seriously, you're gonna be a rock star 'cause you're gonna have two women on your team. Miguel, you're coming with me. Wait, why am I on your team? Because I'm clearly the best shot and you are the weakest link. Okay, who are you calling a weak link? No offense, man. No offense. I just, I play this all the time, all right? I have a, I have a sixth sense. I can tell by looking at somebody, whether they're good or not, and you don't look like you could hit a barn with a shotgun. Am I, am I right, Trevor? We did play for my birthday last year, yeah. What? You suck. Shut up. It's true. Very good. Okay, so here's the rules, okay? The rules of the game: no head shots, no chest shots, arms and legs. If you get hit in the leg, you limp. If you run full out, you're disqualified, you're cheating, okay? Three shots total and your out. Ah, this is gonna be so dope. This is gonna be so dope. One more thing though, don't hate me. All right, guys. Phones in. Let's do it. All right? Come on. What? We have to do it. Come on. It's, I don't want people signaling each other while we're playing. No, I'm not giving you my phone. Can we promise not to? Yeah, we'll like give you our word. Your word, really? I, you know that I've been teaching for almost two decades. A 17 year old's word means about as much as the principal's word, which is not at all. So put your phones in the locker. I mean, he's right. I mean, I've played with guys who've signaled their team members all the time. It's kind of hard not to when you're pinned down and desperate. 'Cause he has a point. Expert analysis. Thank you very much. Extra points this semester, for sure. For real? Guys, come on. I'm really, I'm a nice guy. I'm cool, and this is like, this is a time machine for me with you guys right now doing this. This is amazing. Don't think that I'm so old that I don't remember what it was like to be your age, because I do. Come on, level playing field. Let's do this. I, I'm in as well. Come on, give me your phones. Thank you. Give me your phone. Come on. Genesis, come on. Thank you. The game demands a strong willingness for teamwork. The game demands strategic thinking. The game, ladies and gentlemen, is capture the flag, located in the perfect midpoint. We start on opposite ends of the school. Sadie, Trevor, and Genesis, you take up position at the south entrance. Miguel and myself will start on the edge of the east wing. Hey, you do me a favor, when you see that clock hit-00, it's go time, all right? That's the green light. Well, what do we do then? Just follow me. Watch the firework. Here. You're out. So look, we're three, we have the advantage. I'll run point. I'll signal you guys forward, you sweep the perimeter. English, nerd. Look around and make sure no one is there and wave me forward. We'll stop at the locker on the way. Um it's not the best cover, but it's better than nothing, so. You are way too into this. Have you ever been shot by a pellet? I have. It doesn't feel like a water balloon. Water balloons hurt. Here we go. Come on. Come on. That's it. The flag's right there inside the office. Wait here. Sh. What are we waiting for? - Wait! - What? Is he there? He's right by the soda machine. So he beat us. Only one way to find out. When he takes me out, there'll be a moment where he's focused only on me. I'll obscure a path. That doesn't make sense. It does. He's sacrificing himself. - Are you sure that'll work? - Not at all. Look, chances are one or both of you will be able to run with me. It's the only strategy we have. Okay, but- - Look, on three. One, two, three. Wait! Oh, snap! Fuck! Ah! Motherfucker! Hi! Okay, well, it looks like I chose the wrong teammate. Did you see me in the mirror over there? Yeah? Yeah. Tactical skills on point. Should bode well for your future. You guys ready to go for round two? Shouldn't we take a second to like clean off and regroup? No, no. We, we don't wanna be here for more than one or two hours because that security guard might loop back around again. You know what though? I do wanna change up the teams. Sadie, do you wanna come with me? What, did I say something that was funny? No, not at all, Mr. Dunbar. Why do you want her on your team? Well, Trevor two things, first, she's really great at taking direction. And as you were all painfully aware of in this last round, my current teammate is not. And the second? And the second is, and you guys should know this, I have a massive, massive crush on her. What? What, did I say something? Mr. Dunbar, that's really weird. Why is that really weird, Genesis? But I'm just parroting a rumor that I heard from some students at school. What are you talking about? I was in your Zoom meeting. I heard everything you guys said. I, I heard you guys even talking about coming here tonight, which is why I am here just to have a little fun. That stuff we said, I mean, we didn't- - Yeah, we were kidding. No, the thing, I don't think, I don't think that those were jokes. Genesis, I think if, uh, if the mood struck you, that you'd, you'd turn me in. I do. I think that you guys would have lied collectively and ruined my career. And that sucks. Doesn't it? Doesn't that suck? And why? All because I showed a little favoritism to Sadie, Mr. Dunbar, you've got it all wrong. We would never do anything like that. I don't think that I do have it all wrong. I think that you have it all wrong, Miguel. I think that you have it all wrong about me. Your faces. You guys are ridiculous. I'm kidding. I'm joking. I'm not mad. I'm not mad. Your faces. I do, however, wanna fly solo on this next round if that's okay. Is that okay with you guys? Should we, say, what, when the little hand hits the five, game one? That sounds good? Yeah? All right. What the fuck was that? Miguel, you're shaking. Fuck. You guys, I think we should get out of here. Yeah, you think? Let's go. Wait, what about our phones? - Shit, shit. - I don't care about my phone. Okay? Let's just get out of here. Are you fucking high? I'm not leaving here without my phone. I'm serious. Fine. You guys go on without us. We'll get your phones and we'll meet you at the front entrance. - Come on. - Yeah, whatever. Yeah, let's go. I'll see you there. - Jesus Christ. - Fuck. Why do we need our phones? Because. It'll be okay. So what was all that about? What? He knew your Instagram handle. So what? - I mean your own private- - What, Trevor? Did you give him your number or something? Did I give him my phone number? I'm asking. No, he follows me on Instagram. It's not a big deal. But your page is private, which means you had to give him access to your page. We have all of our pictures on your page. Yes, detective. So what? Did he ever DM you? I don't know. No, fuck that. You'd remember. I DM a lot of people. Okay. I'm not talking about this. I just wanna go home. Fuck this. I think somebody double-locked it so no one can come in or come out. Let's just go out the way we came. Yeah, but, hold on. Listen. What? Metal? Chains. It's giving me a little bit of slack. I, I think they were locked by chains from the outside. They probably are. What? Trevor, when we came in, there weren't chains on the outside. You were looking? - No, but- - So how would you know? Then why won't it open? I don't know, let's just go back the way we came. Come on! Why don't you just break a window then, tough guy? There's no point. There's barbed wire on the windows. Stop. Jesus, Gen, stop! I need my phone! I'm not leaving without it. Fuck. - Fucking- - Trevor! Trevor! What? Something is wrong. Something is fucking wrong. Here, move. Keep going. Yeah, I am. I almost got it. Mr. Dunbar? You know, that's a pretty serious offense, destroying school property. Let's get out of here. I'm not leaving. Gen! Fuck! What the fuck, man? Dude, we're not playing anymore. What the hell, man? Stop! Gen, let's go. My phone! Forget your phone. You guys, we need to get out of here. Yeah. I'm over this shit. No, he locked all the doors. What? Dude, I'm not fucking around anymore. We're done playing. Really? You're done playing paintball? Look, someone's gonna get hurt. And if you don't stop shooting that thing, it might be you. Good. The game's over. I'd be lying if I didn't say I wasn't a little disappointed. You know, Washington, he may have been a bitch, but I don't think he ever surrendered. Hey, we gotta go. We have to get past him to get to the west entrance. Yo, we're leaving, man. It's a free country. Why don't you just come out? I just gave up my Second Amendment right. That's not enough? - It's okay. - What? We have to walk right past him. He threw his gun out. Well, what if he has another one? I'm not staying here. Okay. Fuck. It's fine, he bailed. - Ah! Oh! - Hey, what the fuck, man? We said we were done! - Ah! Oh! - Trevor, this is not paint, oh my gosh. - Trevor! - Oh shit, it's blood! What? - What the fuck? - Shit, dude! - Fuck! - Get up! - Get up! - Come on! Oh fuck, bro! Come on, go! You've got it! Keep going, keep going! Get up! Get up! Go! Come on! - Get up! - Come on! - Get up! - Get in the fucking door! Get up! Come on, put him here. Put him here, come on. Stay there, stay there, stay there! He's bleeding bad. - Don't say that! - Say what? You're talking about me like I'm not here and it feels like I'm gonna fucking die! You're not gonna die! Look, nobody's gonna die, man, all right? Genesis fucking bailed on us! Ah, fuck. All right, help me with this. Come on. I'll get it. I got it. I got it. I got it. - This way. - Fuck, fuck, fuck. Okay, come on, come on. Get up, get up. Get your ass up! Come on! - Oh, fuck. - Hold on, hold on. Guys, get in here! Help me get this window open. Fuck, fuck, fuck! Oh, I'm sorry! Come on, get up, man. I can't. I don't wanna die, man! It's okay. Stop! You're not gonna die. This only opens a little bit. We can't fit through here. You know what really upsets me? That we never got to Theodore Roosevelt in class, who is by far, in my opinion, our greatest president. And I quote, "The fool, who has not sense" to discriminate between what is good and what is bad is well-nigh as dangerous as the man who does discriminate Daddy! And yet chooses the bad. Hey! There's someone out there. - What? - Hey! Help us! No, on the podcast that we will never do but we should do if we had any balls at all. Hey, help us! Help us! I their I'm lightheaded. And we don't judge, 'cause we wanna see this thing through, right? So we're laying on the couch, we got the wine, and this mutt won't leave me alone all night. - Fuck! God. - Come on. So I kick it a little, you know? Okay, I don't wanna hurt the dog. I kick it just a little bit, just to say, you know, "Let's not." She's a little, unhurt, unneutered dog, gonna have sex with my dime. I mean, what the... Can we? Hold on a minute. You know what? Let me call you right back, all right? Yeah, let me call you right back. Come on! Hey! Help us! What are you kids doing in there? Help us! - I'm lightheaded. - Help! Hey dude, hey. Get up! Get, get! Fucking help me, please! Ah shit. Help me Hey! What the fuck? We have to go. We have to go now. We're not leaving him here? We have to, if we don't, we're gonna die too, come on. Fuck! Shit. What the hell? What the fuck is this shit? - Hey! - Hey! We're the fuck have you been? I was hiding. I saw him go outside and I couldn't get through any of the doors. Where's Miguel? He's fucking dead. What? We have to get outta here. Ow! Oh! Can you stand up? - No, yeah, get up. - Get up. Stand up. Come on, get up. We have to get another way. This side of campus is all locked. Mr. Dunbar has been here forever. He's gotta know all the hallway passages and everything. And with her hobbling, we'll never be fast enough. Don't even think about fucking leaving me. No, someone has to bait him. No. I think, I think we all go. I could run. No, no, no, no, no. Stop helping her. Trevor! Look, I'll lure him that way, okay? It'll buy you guys some time. I'll find another way out. - Okay. - Just go. Good plan. - Go. - Okay. Fuck. Wow. Your friends left you, huh? That is fucked up. Hey, help us! Hey! Help us! Hey! Fuck you, Dunbar. First of all, it's Mr. Dunbar. Fuck you, Mr. Dunbar. If there's one thing that you learned from my class this semester as a baseline are fucking manners. You know that? - Ow! - Come here. What are we waiting for? I don't know which way to go. I'm not picky. Why can't you think of away? Well, for one, I think I have a concussion, okay? Don't pressure me. I don't do well under pressure. Well, I could go- - Wait, last semester, drama club after school, I would go and smoke- - Gen, who fucking cares? - No, no, no. The backstage stairwell, it's the auditorium roof. It's never locked. Are you sure? Now, no. It was last winter. But it could still be unlocked. You have a better idea? Come on. Is there anybody in here? Because if there is, I am definitely gonna need to see a bathroom pass at the end of this. You know what bothers me more than anything has for the past few decades that I've been a teacher? Kids saying that they have to go to the bathroom, you get them a bathroom pass, but they don't really have to go. They're just bored. I mean, I understand that. Hell, I get bored. That doesn't seem like a boredom issue for me, that just seems like a general respect issue. I'm a slave to the bell also, you know? I can't leave. I can't go. I gotta stay. It's ridiculous. It's archaic. What other job forces you to clinch a shit for 55-plus minutes, just staring at the clock and praying? Let's wait. Stop. - Come on we're almost there. - Let's wait. Stop. You go and see if it's open and then come back. Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Really? Maintenance locked all the doors. Gen? Please, you're scaring me. - Are you okay? - He's here. He's here. - Where's Gen? - I don't know. Crazy story. I never told anybody this before. I got a call from Principal Kabasis a few years back asking me how I would feel about teaching a theater class. The regular teacher, I guess she got some sort of like mononucleosis illness kind of thing. She retired early and took her syllabus with her. - Where is he? - I don't know! I don't know. I was, I was nervous. I was reluctant. But then, you know what? At some point I thought, "What the hell." I'm gonna step outside of my comfort zone. "I'm gonna dive in." I even wrote a little one-act called "The Death of Lincoln." You know, I put a lot of time into it, not just writing the playbook, but like prep hours, lesson plans. So we're a few days from coming back from summer break and I find out that Principal Kabasis reallocated the budget funds for the class. - We gotta go. - I'm not leaving her here. So the class got cut. They spread out the kids into different electives and I went back to another awesome year of teaching history. But it's funny, I always, I always wondered what would have happened if I had gotten the chance to put that play on. And now, I don't have to wonder. This is it. It's happening right now. I have a cast. It's amazing. Mr. Dunbar, please. She seems really scared. Either that, or she's a really, really good actress. You wanna try for extra credit? Mm-hmm. Three questions, no mistakes. Get three in a row, you live, okay? You good on that? Perfect. So am I. All right, first one, this is a, it's a layup, it's an easy one, name the president that helped free the slaves. Sorry. Abraham Lincoln. What war did he preside over? The C-Civil War. She's very good. Sadie, a little competition for you. Who killed Abraham Lincoln? I know, that's a hard one. I'll give you three clues, okay? He shot Lincoln in the back of the head, he escaped from the scene of the crime, and he has three names. Wait. Wait, I know this. I know this. Three, three word name. Lee Harvey Oswald. Gen, no, no. No. No Almost. No! Oh god. Let's go! In here, come on. He's locked up the doors. All the windows have bars on them. We can't leave, we can't call. Does the school have any landlines? What does your mom use? All the landlines are on a channel, where the main office calls out. That's too far on the other side of campus. He's probably cut them anyways. We can't get to our cell phones, unless you have another one, I don't. What? There is one. What? What do you mean? You have another phone? No, Coach Bird keeps one his office. What? He keeps a old burner phone in his drawer. I seen him use it at the Ultimate Frisbee Competition. But I mean, we all think he has something going on on the side. I mean, he's married, but- - No, you have to double back. You could be walking right into him. We can't go anywhere. Everything is sealed off! Either we find a way to call or we die here. That's it. I don't wanna be left alone. Look, just stay put, okay? I'm coming back. I'm coning right back. Please stop, I'm scared. I'm scared too. But this is the only shot we have. That is one of the fastest suicides that I've ever seen run. For real. And believe me, I subbed a lot of PE classes. Ah! Ah! Fuck! I wouldn't worry about it. You'll be okay. Just put some ice on it. Fuck. And you're not supposed to be in the coach's office unattended. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Yes! Fuck. My name is Trevor Bentel and I need help. Somebody's trying to k- Somebody's trying to f- - I like it when you open up with your thoughts. The game demands strategic thinking. The game, ladies and gentlemen, is captured the flag. Sadie! Exact-Exactly. Exactly. It's a beauty contest, right, Lilah? Lets bring out our animal contestants! Hey, baby. Hi. Look at you. I love you. I miss you. What are you doing? I'm just watching the TV and Mommy is sleeping. It is really late. You should be sleeping. What did you- - What are you doing calling me? Can you put Sierra back on, on the phone? - No. - Please. You have a lot of gall calling after that shit you pulled with the bike the other day. I'm sorry. You're sorry? That's a first. It might've been the first time I've said it, but it is definitely not the first time I've been it. What do you want? It is really over, isn't it? We're over. I get that. I understand that now. I just tried so freaking hard. I did. I tried, really. I want you to know that. I know. I do. I know. I know you do. You gave up. Just don't ever forget that. You're the one that gave up. No. Listen, I just knew when it was time to go. That's something you something you, that's something you never figured out. I guess I was too late for that then, huh? Listen, the hex bolt for the, for the bike to, to put it all back together is in the top drawer in my desk. John, where are you? Can you do me a favor? Just tell Sierra that I really love her, that I do, and you too. Forget the bike, tell me where you're at. Do you know why I saved you for last? What do you want? Do you know why you're last? You're not last. I never had any intention of hurting you. Mr. Dunbar, you- - Don't call me Mr. Dunbar. Call me John. Let's just stop playing games. I don't wanna be here. What do you mean? What do you mean you don't wanna be here? I don't wanna be here. Remember when we were texting on the phone right after you gave me your number on Instagram? That was for school. It was for an assignment. You were flirting with me. No, I was not flirting with you! - Yes you were. - No. I wasn't. Then why did you give me your number? - I didn't mean to. - Really, why did you give me your number? I didn't mean to! I'm stupid! I'm a stupid teenager, man. What do you want me to say? I'm sorry. Remember when you said that you wished, sometimes, that you could start school all over again? Everyone says that. You can. You can, we can. We can move somewhere else. And I can get a respectable job, but I need to have someone strong beside me for that. You know how many years of my life I've lost to this fucking job? And I refuse to believe that it's too late for me. I refuse. Come here. Come here. Everyone deserves a second chance, everyone. And I know that you don't understand that now, but you will. You were always the cleverest one. Sir! Put the gun down! - Sir! - Hey, guys. - Step away from the girl! - Don't, don't start yelling. Okay? We're having a conversation here. Put the gun down. I'm a public servant also, okay? - Step away. - Put the gun down. I'm not asking again. I'm one of the good guys too. - Drop the gun. - We're all good guys. Sir, drop the gun. Sadie, are we gonna do this or what?
