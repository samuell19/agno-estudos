NARRATOR: Four men. Four men each from a different walk of life. A clerk, an airman, a prize fighter and a gentleman of leisure. A few weeks ago, they were strangers. Now, here they are driving together to what? Why did you have to steal a car? You said we'd use yours. This one's faster. That case on the floor, Mike. Open it. What's this? - What's the idea with the guns? - Thought you said no violence. I'm not gonna use this, Rave. If you do as you're told, you won't have to. NARRATOR: Four men with four guns. Why? This is Joe Halsey, American citizen, age 34. Occupation, clerk, ex-serviceman. No criminal record. - (KNOCK ON DOOR) - Come in. You wanted to see me? I have an appointment in a few minutes, so make it quick. OK. I'd like a week off, starting tomorrow. - What the blazes for? - Well, I have to go to England. I plan to fly. How long have you been back with the firm, Halsey? About, uh... four months. And you were away in Korea for two years, right? Yeah. During which time, your job was kept open for you. And during which time, Wilkins took on your work as well as his own. Voluntarily, and for no extra pay. For which he's just been promoted. He's a clever guy, Wilkins. He's a really clever guy. That sort of an attitude will get you nowhere, Halsey. It's stupid and ungrateful. What reason have you to go? I just gotta go, isn't that enough? It most certainly is not. Alright, Mr Carruthers. I've got a wife, I happen to be in love with her. Three months ago, she went to England for two weeks. Her mother was sick. But she's still there, Mr Carruthers. Her mother's still sick, she says. I don't believe that, do you hear me? I don't believe it. I'm sorry, Halsey. But this is a business organisation. You seem to forget that you've just recently been absent for two years. I seem to... I seem to forget... Now, now, Halsey... - Give me Pan American airlines. - Halsey, you're fired! (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Joe, darling! - Hello, Mary. - Oh, it's good to see you. I only got your cable two hours ago. I couldn't believe it! Maybe you didn't want to believe it. What? Oh, Joe, what is it? - We can't talk here. - Darling, what's the matter? You know what the matter is, alright. But I don't. You going to tell me you're ready to come back with me on the next plane? Well, not the next plane, Joe, but soon! - When Mother's alright, and... - And what? Joe, not here, I... And what? Come on, come on. Let's have it, let's get it over with. Well, it's just that I haven't been very well myself lately. - Oh, no. - It's nothing serious. I'm just going to have a baby, that's all. A... Oh, honey! Well, I'd have written and told you but I thought I was coming home. (THEY LAUGH) Oh, gee, baby, that's great! Well, come on, honey! Let's go. Leave your bag there, darling. - WOMAN: That you, Mary? - Yes, dear. Where have you been? You said half past three. It took longer than we expected. - Here's Joe. - Hello there, Mrs Freeman. It's nice to see you again. Do you think he's changed much, Mother? No, I don't think so. After all, it is three years. Well, we never got to know each other that well. No, we didn't. - Cigarette, Joe? - Oh, thanks. Well, I suppose you've come to take Mary back to America again. Yeah. Yeah, that's why I've come. He wants me to fly back with him in two or three days' time. Oh. Well, I suppose you'll have to go then, won't you? Well, is there any reason why she shouldn't? Joe... It's alright, Mary. I know your husband thinks that I've kept you here deliberately. But of course, he doesn't realise how ill I've been. I've told Joe about the baby, Mother. Yeah, that's great news, isn't it? What are we gonna call him? How about, um... How about George? - That was your father's name, wasn't it? - No. OK, OK, I'm sorry. I don't wish to talk about it. - Can't you see you're upsetting me? - Now, wait a minute. It was always the same. No consideration for me, none at all. You think about nothing but yourselves the whole time. Leave me here all alone. (SHE SOBS) Leave me to die... Still the same, sweet old Mother. Every time I tried to come home, she had another attack. Joe, come and sit down here. Can I get the tickets? Yes. You sure you won't change your mind? You sure you won't let her change it for you? I want to go home, Joe. I'll tell her tonight. We're on our way, honey. NARRATOR: Four men with four guns. Here is Mike Morgan, British. Age 31, professional boxer. Served honourably with the Navy. No criminal record. - How's he making out, Doc? - Pretty poorly. Acute concussion. I'm sending him to hospital. But Doc, he fights next week in Blackpool! It ain't gonna look so good. Well, I shall have to send in a report to the Board of Control. I don't think he should fight again. But Doc, now, don't be hasty. It's happened before. We felt fine the next day. I'm sure you have, but it's happened once too often. The way these guys take away a guy's living... Give over, Brooksy. The Chocolate Boy's been with you for 15 years. I boxed him seven years ago and he was finished then. - Why don't you help him for a change? - For instance? Help him to get out of the game. That's all these punks think about, is getting out of the game. They don't love it no more, Brooksy, and that's a fact. - They don't love it no more. - Yeah. You and me love the game, that's why we're in it. Well... Good luck, Stookey. And you, Mike. Yeah. We've had our share of luck already, Mike, just getting you this fight. - The way I had to talk! - Yeah. You're good at that. The minute I heard that kid Gavin was backing out I put you up as a substitute straight away. They didn't want you, Mike, but... You talked them into it, you've told me before. How long is it since you topped a bill, Mike? Just after the war. - Tim Mahoney. - Yeah. It's a pity you hit him with your chin. Watch this Milton, he punches like a tiger. Oh, my favourite fighter! How do you feel, son? - Bit nervous. - Ha-ha! Nothing to it. You've got what it takes, son. I can smell a champion a mile off. Listen, this is how we'll do it tonight... Bunny. Who's the green boy? That's Stookey's new prospect, Ron Simpson. Last year's amateur welter champion. - He's a good boy. - Yeah. We were all good boys, once. I'll let you into a secret, Bunny. - This is the last one. - Good-o, Mike. - Stookey know? - No. If he knew, he wouldn't let me have this fight. How are you off for the ready? I've got £900 in the Post Office. Tonight's hundred gives me the thousand. I promised Angela I'd quit when I got that behind me. - It's taken me 12 years to do it, Bunny. - Yeah. And there's Stookey geeing that kid on over there about fame and fortune. We get the fame and he gets the fortune. In my case, I got neither. - (CROWD ROARS) - Somebody's been put away. I'll owe you 5-4 it's Ashby. Come on, give us your hand. What's that, Mike? What's wrong with your fork? I don't know, I hurt it in training two days ago. Well, let's have a look at it. (HE WHISTLES) Blimey. You've had it, chum. Get the bandage on, Bunny, and not a word to Stookey. Now, look here, you can't fight a guy like Milton with one hand! I've got to, Bunny. I need that hundred quid. I want to get out of the game. I don't want to end up like the Chocolate kid tonight. Bind it good and hard. Something's gotta hold it together. Sorry I'm late, they were fixing my bandages. - How do you feel, Mike? - Fine. This is the last time? Yeah. Win or lose. In a way, I want you to lose, because I know that's final. A win and you promise yourself one more fight. Angie, will you do me a favour? - Don't watch tonight. - I never do watch. I just shut my eyes and pray you won't get hurt too much. (CROWD ROARS) No, don't come in. Go straight to Rudy's, I'll meet you there after the fight. What you gonna do with your husband in a regular job, Angie? I suppose we'll just be like everybody else. - Perhaps we can get a little house. - And kids. Imagine us with kids! Promise? Promise. I never made the grade like I said I would. But I tried. See you at Rudy's. Promise? - Ready, son? - Yeah. I've got a splitting headache. Come on, let's go and make some money. (CROWD CHATTERS) ANNOUNCER: Seconds out! (BELL RINGS) (CROWD SHOUTS) (CROWD SHOUTS) (CROWD ROARS) (HE WHISPERS) (CROWD SHOUTS) (BELL RINGS) (APPLAUSE) I thought I told you to keep away from him. I tried. What are you trying to do to me, ruin my reputation? Your only chance now is to go in there and mix it, slug it out with him. Sure, "mix it, slug it out". It's not his nose and jaw and belly that's being hit, is it? It's just beginning to dawn on me, Mr Stockey dunno what he's talking about. How's the hand, kid? Hasn't fallen off yet. Here, let me throw in the towel, Mike. It's your last fight, anyhow. I'm not going out that way, Bunny. ANNOUNCER: Seconds out! (BELL RINGS) (CROWD CHATTERS) MAN: Come on, Mike! ...four, five six, seven... eight... MAN: Go on, Mike! He was a good boy in his day. Good, him? Nah. What did I tell ya? That boy'll be a champion one day. The next fight'll cost you double. Ho-ho! I love him like my own son. (APPLAUSE) ANNOUNCER: Our new champion! Good work, boy. Good work. Oh, I've never seen such a punch! In all my years in the ring, I've never seen a comeback like that. In all your years in the ring... You've never been in the ring. You send other mugs in to get their brains knocked out. We're on our way to the top now. Nothing can stop us! This is as far as we're going. Now get the money, Stockey, and take your cut. It's the last you'll get. Alright, boy. You'll feel better after a shower. Bet you thought I lost. Yes. I won. Knocked him out in the second. I know what you're thinking. But it's a good way to end, with a knock-out win. A good way to end? - You really meant it? - Yeah. - What sort of job will you get, Mike? - I don't know. Heavy metals, maybe. Great fight, Mike. Few more wins like that and you'll be challenging the top boys again. How did you know we were here? Why, Angie... You don't seem pleased to see your brother. What do you want, Dave? We only see you when you want something. Now, that's not nice. Still, this time, you're right. ANGELA: If it's a question of money... This is between me and Mike, Angie.. A straight loan between brothers-in-law, eh, Mike? I owe a guy £100. A gambling debt. - What's that got to do with Mike? - Everything. I was at the fight tonight and I gave a guy 10-1 that Mike'd lose. Thanks. What do you want to win for? After that first round, there was a cast-iron certainty my money was safe. - It was a lucky punch, that's all. - Yeah, maybe, but it sunk me. I'll pay you back, Mike, honest I will. Don't give it to him, Mike. But Angie, I can't welch on a bet. They'll put the strong-arm boys on me. You can go back to prison for all I care. If you think Mike's giving you that money, you're wrong. OK. But if you won't let me have the money, I'll rob a house or something. You'd better do that. So this is how you promised Mum you'd look after me. I'd have given him the money if you'd wanted it. I know you would, Mike, but what's the point? Next week, it'll only be something else. Here. Put it in the Post Office in the morning. You kept your word, Mike. And I love you for it. Oh, your hand. You've hurt it. No, it's nothing, it's only a bruise. But didn't Stookey make you show it to the doctor? No. - I was in a hurry to get away. - Well, let's get home. I'll bandage it for you. NARRATOR: The third man with a gun is Sergeant Eddie Blaine. This is his wife, Denise. A film actress, occasionally. Eddie Blaine is with the American Air forces in England. Age 36, war hero. No criminal record. (GIRLS CHATTER) Marion. Oh... you all know Miss Lynn. Miss Denise Lynn. Why don't you sign one, darling? Oh, ng, really, I... I think that's all for tonight, children. Goodnight, darlings. Goodnight, Todd. Goodnight, sweetheart. (DOORBELL RINGS) - Hello, Eddie. - Hello. Doesn't look very good, does it? It looked a lot better an hour ago. It probably did. Sorry, dear. If you hadn't called me from the studio and said you'd be right home I would've held it up. Don't be tiresome, Eddie. When I called you, I thought I was leaving right then. So what? So what? So I hope you like your meat well done. Do you think I enjoy cooking this stuff? Eddie, dear, I didn't ask you to stand slaving over a hot stove so let's not be stupid about it. Just in case you've forgotten, I'm only on a 48-hour pass. Last night, you were kept at the studio till midnight. Can I help it if the director takes it into his head to shoot four extra scenes? OK. CK. So tonight the idea was to have a nice, quiet dinner in our own home. Just for once, in a couple of years. Well, it didn't work out. That's all. Because you were kept late at the studio again? Why else? I thought maybe because Todd Maslin's car broke down. That was his car brought you home, wasn't it? - It was. - Yeah, I thought I recognised him. What a jerk. He's had his hair curled since I saw him last. Well, there's no need to be selfish, Eddie. Todd Maslin has become the biggest thing in pictures and he's asked little me to be with him in his next film. How exciting. I saw your last picture, by the way. Who was the guy you said your line to? I'm afraid, Eddie, your life in the Airforce has coarsened your mind. Well, I wouldn't be surprised. Not that you know anything about my life in the Airforce. Oh, look, Denise, why don't you forget about... Please, Eddie. Yes, I know, we've been through all that. You've got your career to think about and a girl can't be a camp follower and... and a bit player all at the same time. You know, Eddie, your conversation becomes more stupid every time I see you. Well, that's something you won't have to worry about for quite some time. Unless my little wife is gonna follow her devoted husband to Germany. You mean you're being transferred? - When? - Next month. Well, why didn't you say anything yesterday? - When you arrived? - You'll laugh when I tell you. I had the crazy idea my wife would be happy to see me and I didn't want to spoil the fun. Can you beat that? You know, it's funny, Denise. You don't give a damn about me and I know it. Yet I go on being crazy about you. Do you, darling? That's alright then. Isn't it? Look, Denise, why don't we go out to some swank restaurant tonight where there's music and we can dance and have some fun what do you say? No, you go and have fun. I'm going to bed. I've had a pretty long day. Well, you have to eat, don't you? I had a sandwich on the way back. You had a sandwich? Well, that's fine! That makes my day. Maybe you'd like me to go back to camp tonight 50 as not to disturb your beauty sleep? No. But if you come in late, try not to wake me. I'm on first call tomorrow, I have to be out of here by seven. Goodnight, darling, and have a good time. NARRATOR: And lastly, Miles Ravenscourt. Age 30, only son of Sir Francis Ravenscourt. Occupation, gentleman. Decorated at El-Alamein. Likewise, no criminal record. I'm so sorry, darling, I've had so much to do today. - Hmm? - I said I'm sorry I'm late. What time is it? It's 10.30. Oh, gosh, dinner... I am sorry. It doesn't matter. It's too late to go out now. (SHE SIGHS) There's something the matter with your eyes. RAVE: See yourself as others see you. At a thousand guineas a time. And you, with all the money in the world. It's absurd. It's unjust, isn't it? It isn't. I think I'm very lucky. I think we're both very lucky. - Drink? - No, thank you. You know, there are not many people who've been married as long as we have and are still perfectly happy. Will you go on being happy, do you think? But certainly. Provided, of course, that I continue to keep you in the manner to which you have become accustomed. You took the words right out of my mouth, my darling. Well? You're looking very attractive tonight, you know. - But then you always do. - What is it this time? You read me like a book, don't you? Don't overdo the boyish candour, Rave. It's a trick of yours I know. - It's a trick of mine you like. - What do you want? I gave old Harry a cheque for 1,000 tonight. I'm afraid there's nothing in the bank to meet it. - Well then, why did you give it to him? - Because I lost it playing poker. Anyway, as long as we put the money first thing in the morning... I'm sorry, Rave. You're getting no more money from me. In that case... I'm going to be in rather an embarrassing position, you know. Rave, why must you always show off? You know you can't afford to gamble like this. I know I shouldn't. Let me run you a nice, hot bath. It'll put you in a friendlier mood. I had a bath before the dinner we didn't go to. Listen, Rave, tonight it was poker. Yesterday, the eternal "new car". Every other day, bookmakers' bills. "Drinks all round, good old Rave. Always ready for the touch." Well, it's over, darling. I'm not paying anymore. Mrs Ravenscourt, we have this dialogue regularly once a month. Let me off tonight. What would you do if I told you I was broke? You're not, are you? No. But I am as far as you're concerned. But why? Because I want to feel I married a man, not a sponger. What would you have done if you hadn't married me? Been a burglar. You know, I've been thinking a lot about you lately. In all these years, I don't think I've ever known you do a single day's work. What were you like in the Army? I was a good soldier. I killed well. If Harry's cheque isn't met, London isn't going to be very comfortable for us. I had a letter from my father this morning. Oh? How's he liking it out there? He loves it. Rave... What did you think about living in Kenya? Father's promised to give you a job. RAVE: That's very handsome of him. I wouldn't think of it. London's our town. I like everything about it. Including your debts? Which brings us back to Harry's cheque. We can't let him down, can we? - I can. - Well, what do you want me to do? Call him up and tell him the cheque's no good? Yes, darling. That's just what I want you to do. You're a very beautiful woman, Eve. And beautiful women shouldn't try and be clever. Our life's alright. Let's just live it. We're both a little on edge and need a change. Why don't we take the car and go somewhere in the sun? I'm going to Kenya. There's plenty of sun there. And I'm staying in London. When you wake up in the morning, you'll want to stay too. Where are you going, Eve? To Kenya. Sure? Now where are you going, Eve? I'm... I'm going... What is it, Mike? I couldn't sleep. Worried? Yeah. I wonder how I'll settle down to a routine job, Angie. You'll get used to it. I'll help you, Mike. You know, Angie... I've never lived without the roar of the crowd. It was great when you won. Even when you knew that the next time, they'd be hollering for your blood? Yeah. But you're done with that now. Oh, Mike... Oh, I'm sorry, your hand. Yeah, it's throbbing like the devil. That settles it, Mike Morgan. First thing in the morning, to the hospital for an X-ray. Not tomorrow morning. I've got to go after that job. Oh, the next day'll do for that. The next day won't do for that. The newspaper said the Kennington Metal works are looking for skilled men. I don't go in the morning, the job may be gone. Besides... And besides what, Mike? Look, Angie. After tonight, there'll be plenty of fights offered me. If I don't get a job quickly... they'll talk me back into the ring. It's as simple as that. Oh, thank you, Lila. I'll take it. Thank you, sir. Tea, darling! Ah, thank you. Now what is this? The cheque. I made it out for you. Must get that money in first thing. You know, Harry's the sort of chap who'll be sitting on the bank steps waiting for it to open. Now, if I do this for you once more will you promise me not again? Ever? Promise? Promise. If lie, I hope to die. Oh, really, darling? I don't mind having a row with you at night, there's plenty of time to make it up then but I must have that cheque this morning. You really are rather common, Eve. You've had me watched. The regimental dinner last week. My manicurist! Who'd have thought of that? Last Tuesday, your old sergeant in hospital. Only decent if you took him some fruit. I hope the girl from the Post Office enjoyed the grapes. Does a silly little stamp-licking brunette or a blonde polisher of nails matter to us? My life is here with you. I believe you mean that sometimes. Then cover old Harry's cheque, there's a good girl. No, I've made up my mind. You won't get another penny from me. Then I shall just have to tell Harry the cheque's going to bounce. Yes, go and tell him at once, this morning. - There's nothing else I can do. - No, Rave, there isn't. Not now. I'm truly sorry about this. I promise it will never happen again. Perhaps it won't... in Kenya. - Here you are, darling. - Thank you. - It was nice of Mother to send the flowers. - Yeah, maybe she's human after all. She keeps on like this, maybe she can come and live with us. ANNOUNCER: Passengers on Pan American Flight 150 to New York please proceed to the aircraft. Mr Halsey? You and your wife are urgently wanted on the telephone. Quickly, you've just got time. Yes. Yes, alright, I'll come at once. What is it? It's Mother. She's tried to kill herself. How? An overdose of sleeping tablets. Who was that that telephoned? A friend of hers. She went in and found her. But she's alright, isn't she? Look, darling, we've got to catch this plane. She did this once before when I was 14. Look, Mary, this is our last chance. ATTENDANT: We can't keep the plane waiting any longer, Mr Halsey. Come on, honey, we gotta go. I'm sorry, Joe. (BELL RINGS) (HORN BLOWS) (HE CRIES) You're Mrs Morgan? Yes. How is he? Your husband didn't tell you, I suppose he fought last night with a broken hand. No. He didn't say anything. Mrs Morgan, you must understand, he'll never fight again. He doesn't want to. He's finished with all that. I don't mean that. I mean he'll never be able to fight again. What? We managed to save his life, but... not his hand. We had to amputate. Oh, no... DOCTOR: There was no alternative. Gangrene had set in. Now, come, Mrs Morgan. He'll need your help. Yeah. Thanks. So she won after all. I beg your pardon? So tell me, Doctor, how many of those tablets did she take? The box was empty. I know, but how many did she take? Enough to kill her? Oh no, not enough to kill her. Just enough to make her sort of nice and drowsy, eh? About... about three, shall we say? - About that, yes. - Mm-hm. She also managed to have a neighbour call up Mary at the airport. Mr Halsey, have you discussed this with your wife? - No, I haven't. - No, I don't think I should. She's had a considerable shock as it is. Yeah, tell me, Doc... No, I really can't say any more, Mr Halsey. Except that... If I were you, the next time I made any plans I'd stick to them. They'll refund the money. I'm sorry if I've inconvenienced you, Joe. No, you haven't. We'll go just as easy in a couple of days. Oh, I know what you think of me. But you're young, you don't understand. I understand, alright. So does Mary. Oh. Well, in that case, there's nothing more to be said, is there? Of course, if Mary feels it's safe to leave me. What kind of a mother are you, anyway? Don't you care what happens to Mary? Do you care what happens to me? Leaving me here, all alone. That's not true! We wanted you to come with us. Joe offered to... That's right, side with him. Take his part against me. And after all I've done for you. - For Pete's sake. - All I planned... Now you go and leave me, go to the other side of the world. I've had enough of this. Look, you've always hated my guts, I know that. - Oh, please, Joe... - It's true. But get this, Mrs Freeman. Five years ago, your daughter married a GI. She's still married to him and she's gonna stay married to him having children by him and living in New York City in the United States of America 3,000 miles away from you! And maybe she's darn lucky at that. Joel! Where are you going? I got 12 dollars and 50 cents in my pocket. I hope I'm gonna get drunk on it. So for the rest of the night, Mother dear, you're free to laugh your... your head off. Mary! I... I feel faint. MARY: Joe! You're all wet. Thanks. Well... what are you going to do now? We'll register in a hotel. And then you'll go back to America? I don't know what I'm gonna do. Joe, this isn't something that can just be worked out in a few hours. It won't ever be worked out. Joe, stay with me. Don't leave me. What are we gonna live on? There's... there's the money from the air tickets. If I don't get a job, the air ticket money's not gonna last very long. Oh, Joe. Just stay for a few more months. Oh, Mary, this... this mother business is gonna go on forever. Where you going? Alright, alright. Guess I'm an idiot, but... I'd rather share you with your mother than not have you at all. - Hello, Mike. - Hello, Moll. - Found anything yet? - No, no luck. - What's it to be, dear? - Bitter. Got a light, chum? Oh, sure. I'm sorry. One and six, please, dear. Here, have one on me, huh? Cheers. Cheers. Oh, thank you. FRANCIS: Well, what is it this time, my son? The same old story, I suppose. Not quite. I want some real money this time. What do you mean by that? Not yours. My own. You haven't any money of your own. I will have. Eventually. Oh no, my boy. You don't touch a penny of that until I'm dead. It's absurd. You don't need it. - You've plenty of your own. - Plenty. I intend to use your mother's money as she'd have wanted me to. That doesn't include giving any of it to you now. You know, I wouldn't be quite so smug and disinterested if I were you. Someone who is quite determined to be most unpleasant about it has a cheque of mine for a thousand which is probably bouncing at this very moment. So if you're determined not to share the money in a few days from now, you'll be sharing some very lurid headlines. You can't threaten me anymore. Public disgrace couldn't be worse than sitting here being reminded that I'm your father. You really do hate me, don't you? I don't hate you. I loathe and despise the very sight of you. Why do you exaggerate my faults? I suppose it's only vanity and pride that prevent you from exposing me. Common sense. I know you exactly for what you are. A liar, a cheat and a scoundrel, but I can't prove it any more than I can prove that those six Germans you killed in the desert had lost their way, were out of ammunition and unconscious when you came upon them. How very clever of you. Actually, one of them was quite conscious. That's my money you're hanging onto, blast you, and I want it! Once and for all, you won't get one penny of my money ever. Or your mother's, until I'm dead. I may tell you I have one ambition left in life. To outlive you. I see. Oh, well. I thought it would be a waste of time talking to you anyway. It was. You could better employ your talents planning to rob a bank. You'd have more chance of success. That's the way out, my son. - (INDISTINCT CHATTER) - (PIANO PLAYS) Thank you, sir. Three and four, please, gentlemen. (COUPLE LAUGHS) (CASH REGISTER RINGS) There we are. Are you listening to me? Eddie! I don't believe this. - Eddie Blaine. - Joe. Joe Halsey! - How've you been? - Alright, fine. You look great, still in uniform and... Hey, you finally made it. Hey, Mike, I want you to meet an old friend of mine. Eddie Blaine. This Is Mike Morgan, we met here a couple of days ago and it's sort of getting to be a habit. - Hello, Eddie. - Glad to know you, Mike. What are you doing here, Joe? I come over to pick up my wife. How about you? You got a wife now? Yeah, I've got a wife. Hey, let me buy you fellas a couple of drinks. I'm on the loose tonight, I'm celebrating. Sorry, Eddie, I got a wife waiting at home. Ah, that goes for me too. Gee, I'm late already. Well, maybe next time I'm on leave, we can all have a drink. Sure. We're always in here. - Sure, fine. - Nice to have seen you again, Joe. - Good to see you. - Mike, glad to have met you. Bye-bye, Eddie. Buy you a drink? - Well... - Thanks, I'll have a gin. Bye-bye, Winnie dear, I'll see you in the morning. Oh. Alright. Bye. What'll you have? I'm alright, thanks. Here's to Winnie. What are you celebrating? I just heard you tell your friends you were celebrating. Oh, that. Celebrating... Forget it. Are you on leave? Mm-hm, till eight o'clock in the morning. So that gives us about ten hours. "Us"? Are you married? Probably. Why? Oh, I just like to know what the weather's like before I put to sea. What's it like? Fair and warm? Could be. You make good coffee? Yes. Well, you can't make it here. Get your hat. Alright, but I'll have to telephone first. - Husband? - Probably. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (CASH REGISTER RINGS) Yeah, well, I won't know till later... Oh, look at this. - Every light in the place on. - Well, why should he worry? He doesn't have to pay the bills. Well, who cares? Come on. It'll only take me ten minutes to change, then we can... Why, hello, Eddie dear! What are you doing here? Did you forget to go to bed? Of course, you two don't know each other, do you? This is my husband. Eddie, dear, this is Todd Maslin. You remember, he brought me home the other evening? I remember, and now he brought you home again. What's the matter, Mr Maslin? Don't you have a home of your own to go to? Eddie, dear! Oh, you mustn't mind my husband, Todd. He has a rather peculiar sense of humour. I'm afraid, Mr Maslin, I have no sense of humour at all. Eddie, dear, Todd just came in to wait for me while I change then he's driving me out to the studio. - I'm in the picture with her. - How interesting. What are they gonna call it? "Two Tramps In Harmony"? I must remind myself not to see it. I don't think that's at all funny. It wasn't meant to be funny. Well, I... I'm going to change. Oh, Denise, before you go... would you mind telling me where the hell you've been all night? I don't think I would. In your present mood, it would just be a waste of time. Well, I just wanna know, that's all. I just wanna know! Eddie, dear, I'll be obliged if you won't shout at me. I have a headache. Can I get you some aspirin, darling? Oh, would you, darling? - Oh, that's sweet of you. - It's a pleasure. Mm-hm... You know your way around here pretty well, don't you? What? Oh. Well... Well, in case you don't know it all, this is the way out! Wait for me in the car, darling. - Are you sure? - Get out! What did you mean by that crack? Exactly what I said. He seems to know his way around here pretty well and I can imagine what room he knows best. Behind your vulgar tongue, Eddie, dear you have a nasty mind, haven't you? I have to change, and I'd be glad of a little privacy. I'm going to take a bath. That'll give you a chance to get out of here the easy way. I'll send you my address from Germany so you can write and tell me how much you miss me. You know, Eddie, if you go on talking this way I shall begin to think you don't love me. And Eddie, dear, don't slam the door. I have a headache, remember? (SHE HUFFS) (WHISTLE BLOWS) ANNOUNCER: Attention, US Airforce. Attention, US Airforce. Will personnel leaving for Germany please board the special train standing in Platform 12 immediately. Well, have you any idea where she could possibly be? WOMAN: I'm sure I don't know, sir. I think she's gone on holiday. On holiday? Well, if you needed her at the studio for publicity or anything, would you know where to reach her? Oh, she left a phone number. Course, I can't give it to you. Yes, well, I'm her husband. Yes, sir, that's what they all say. Could you tell me whether or not Todd Maslin is on call for the next five days? No, he can't be. They do everything together. Well, it is in the film, of course. Hello. Post Office? Oh, could I speak to the assistant in the supervisor's office, please? Hello there. What are you doing for lunch? Good, then you'll have it with me. I'm just across the road. Fine, I'll see you outside in a few minutes. Goodbye. The usual, Molly. You're Mike Morgan, aren't you? Yeah. What of it? Oh, nothing. I thought I'd recognised you. I've watched you often in the ring. I saw your last fight. Pity about that. - I read about it in the papers. - Yeah. By the way, my name's Ravenscourt. Hello. - What are you doing now? - Nothing. Seeing as there are plenty of jobs you can do with one hand. But they want two-handed men to do them. Mm. I suppose you weren't in the game long enough to make your fortune? No. I saved a bit. You can't do much in a thousand quid. - You could invest it. - In what? You could buy a small business for £1,000. What sort of business? Well, uh... a tobacconist. I know one that's going for just that amount. Sounds like a good idea. Think it over and let me know. I'd be delighted to help you. I wouldn't want to bother you. It's no bother at all. It's a pleasure. - Hello, Mike. How you doing? - Hi, boys. - Hi. - This is Mr, um... Ravenscourt. - Joe Halsey. - How do you do? Eddie Blaine. - How do you do? - Hi. What are you boys drinking? - Beer's fine, thanks. - Beer for me too. - Three beers, Molly, and have one yourself. - Oh, thanks very much. - You having another? - No, not this time, I'm just off. Oh, nice to have met you. I'll see you around sometime. - Yes, I'm here most mornings. - So are we. We're sort of charter members, the Lame Dog Club. - (THEY CHUCKLE) - What's that? No, he's kidding. We're all in a spot of trouble. We meet here every morning to cheer ourselves up. Well, there are worse ideas. Perhaps I can join. Oh, go on, Mr Rave. What troubles have you got? You'd be surprised, Molly. I'm late. Tomorrow, the same time. - Bye. - Sure, fine. Oh, and I'll try and see that man with the business today. MIKE: Thanks. He's a nice chap. What's he do, Molly? Oh, he was in the Army. Got decorated and everything. What's he do now? Nothing. He doesn't have to, he's got pots of money. Lot of fuss about nothing. You're not the only one who's got a right to be sick around here, you know? Mary's case and mine are rather different. Yeah, you're not gonna have a baby. There's no need for you to be coarse. Besides, if you're so worried about Mary's health why don't you stay in and look after her? If you wanna know, I went around the American Embassy to try to find some way of getting Mary and me back to the States without paying for it. Oh, so you've spent all your money, have you? Well, if you were half a man, you'd work your passage back. I could look after Mary. Yeah, you could look after her, alright. Spending half the time having her chase around waiting on you and the other half scaring the living daylights out of her. - How dare you! - I've heard ya. What a bad time you had when she was born, how you almost died how you swore you'd never go through it again. Mary has a right to know the truth. Mary's got a right not to be frightened sick by a selfish, morbid, wicked old... Oh. Perhaps I'd better leave you, Doctor. Yes, you phrased it a trifle strongly, Mr Halsey but you're quite right, of course. She's driving Mary out of her mind, Doc. She's not sleeping nights, she's not eating right. What am I gonna do? The only solution is to get her away, right away. Back to America as soon as possible. I'm broke, Doc. Yes, er... - I would help you if I could... - Oh, no, no, no, thanks. Um... Well, what happens if I don't get her back? If you don't, there may well be serious consequences. - For the baby, you mean? - Not only the baby. Now, try not to worry. It won't help her. She'll sleep tonight. I've left her a sedative to take. - I'll come again tomorrow. - Thanks, Doc. - Hi. - Hello. - How do you feel, honey? - I'm fine. You mustn't get worried, Joe. I'm-I'm not worried. You look great. - What did he say? - Who, the doc? Oh, nothing much. He just said that, uh... well, the climate here wasn't too good for... Well, for Junior and, uh... he thinks we ought to get home as soon as we can. Oh, but Joe, how can we? I don't know. There's one thing I'm sure of. We're going... and soon. ANGELA: No, don't put the light on! What's up? Oh, it's nothing. Just a headache, that's all. Did you find anything, dear? Nah, same old story. I got some other news for you though. I 'met a fella in a pub, he gave me an idea. Says he can fix it up for me. What idea? A business of our own. A shop, Angie. - A shop? - Yeah, a tobacconist. This fella knows of one going. Says he can get it for 1,000. £1,000? Yeah. Our thousand. (DISH CLATTERS) - Oh, I'm sorry... - Never mind that. It's great, isn't it, Angie? Just think of it, our own shop with a flat above. No more worrying, no more looking around for work I can't do. I thought you'd be pleased, Angie. Oh, Mike. Look, it's a good idea, Angie. It could've been... last week. Last week? Here, something's up. What is it? Mike... you haven't got your thousand pounds anymore. What? Where is it? It's Dave, he was arrested. I made bail for him for £1,000. He said he could prove he was innocent if only he was given a little time. Will we get it back after the trial? No, we won't! He's gone! He's run away, he's out of the country! He'll never come back. Well, what about my thousand? (SHE SOBS) The police have got it! We can't get it back. I've asked about it. (SHE SOBS) They can't do that. It's my money. I earned it! I'm sorry, Mike. I had to do it. Look at me. Look at me! You see what I see? Now what did I do it for? Money. The money we were saving together! The money I was going to buy that shop with! And what have I got for my trouble? Stone deaf in one ear, half-blind and only one hand! What sort of a man does that make me? Don't, Mike... Don't. Twelve years of fighting. Twelve years of being punched round the ring! What have I got to show for it? Nothing. Nothing! Mike, dear... Please... I'll put it right. I had to do it, he's my brother, but give me a chance and I'll put it right. - What can you do? - I can work! I'll find a job. As long as we're together... Yeah. I'm sorry, Angie. It'll be alright. You know, Mike, you should've kept your money in the bank. I thought it was safe where it was. No money is safe where a woman can get her hands on it. Where would you keep your money, Joe? If you had any. Wouldn't keep it anyplace, I'd use it. There must be some place around here a guy can put his hands on some dough. There's a Post Office just across the street. - That's very funny. - No, it isn't very. I know what you mean though. Lots of money on the other side of that counter but it belongs to somebody else. Yes, maddening, isn't it? Do you know that in a few nights from now, there'll be something like £100,000 passing through into that building? Yeah? How come? Registered packets from the banks. Returning old treasury notes to the Bank of England for re-pulping. You mean they send it through the mail just like that? Yes. No one has the serial numbers so they're easy to pass. I still say that's very funny. Sorry, Joe. I was only Joking. Here, let me get you another drink. Same again, please, Molly. Hey, ya know something? That guy talks too much. Maybe he's just trying to cheer us up in a weird sort of way. He's right about one thing though. They do get rid of the money that way. Yeah? Yeah. Expect they bring it in a van or something. That's it, Mike. Just an ordinary Post Office van. There is one snag, of course. There are vans turning up at that building all the time. Day and night. But which one has £100,000? You mean you know all the rest and you don't know that? I daresay I could find out for you. Well, that's fine. Then we plan the job, grab the dough and... all wind up in jail. Hey! Eddie. - Going home? - Yeah, it's getting late. Yeah. Uh, you're expecting your wife back today, aren't you? That's right. Well, now, look, don't do anything stupid. You're in enough trouble as it is. You know what you're gonna get... Well, you know what you're gonna get for desertion? Joe, you've got your problems, I've got mine. Why don't you let me handle mine in my own way? It's OK. - I'll see ya, Joe. - So long, boy. Leave it there, darling. We'll just have one quick drink, then go and find some lunch. Stuffy, isn't it? Missing the sea air already? There's no air of any sort in here. Place has been all closed for five days now. Five beautiful, heavenly days. Well, Todd... darling. Welcome home. Bless you, sweetheart. EDDIE: Bottoms up. Eddie! What are you doing here? Just waiting to welcome you home, sweetheart. But you're supposed to be in Germany. I changed my mind. Did you have a nice vacation? You've got it wrong. Not "vacation", Mr Blaine. Location. We've been on location with the film, you know? Yeah. Yeah, I know. Oh. Todd, I think you'd better go down and wait in the car. This is where we came in. - Whatever you may think... - Whatever I may think, Mr Maslin can't be as dirty as the truth. Now, get out of here before I do something about it! Now, just a minute, Blaine. I think it's about time you and I understood one another. We do. We do, Mr Maslin. You take what you can get. And I try to keep what belongs to me. I'd say that was a pretty fair summary, wouldn't you, Denise? Darling, if there's anything... Please go, Todd. Alright, I'll go. I'll see you tomorrow, darling. Alright, I'm going! But I'm not satisfied. You satisfied now, Mr Maslin? Any questions? If you didn't go to Germany, I suppose now you're a deserter. That's right, I'm a deserter. But Eddie, why didn't you go to Germany? Because I had a little job to do here first. Something I should've done a long time ago. What stupid thing do you have in mind now? It isn't stupid. A little late, maybe, but it isn't stupid. What are you going to do, Eddie? (SHE YELLS) I should've done this five years ago! Eddie, stop it! Eddie! Eddie! Stop it! - Have a good bath! You need one! - Eddie! Eddie! Oh... Oh, I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! (SHE SOBS) (SHE SCREAMS) Eddie! Eddie! (SHE SCREAMS) Hello, dear. Harry phoned this morning. - Oh? - Yes. I've paid him. I've got your cheque back. There it is. And there's your ticket and passport. The plane leaves London Airport at three in the morning. I've ordered the car for half past one. I may have to meet you at the airport. I've got something on tonight. Got something on? What? What on Earth do you mean? That's entirely my business, and I think you're assuming rather a lot... Rave, no, please, don't let's have all that over again. You know, darling, it's only because of you that I'm determined to go. I don't relish the idea of having nothing but planters and their wives to paint but if we both try, I'll settle down and so will you. We'll be happy together, I promise. Shelling coffee beans is not my idea of heaven. You'd better be there, Rave. You know... I really wouldn't want to live without you. Being alone is something we all have to get used to sometime or another. Does that mean you're not coming? Not necessarily. A change of climate may suit me. And perhaps I won't be able to live without you... after all. Here, let me help you pack. - (INDISTINCT CHATTER) - (PIANO PLAYS) I brought one for Rave. He should be here soon. - (INDISTINCT CHATTER) - (CASH REGISTER RINGS) Oh, hello, boys. They say money can't buy happiness. I don't know, maybe they're wrong, maybe it can. Well, looks like the end of Denise. At least I got a letter from her saying goodbye. You know, in the Army, they taught me not to think for myself. Well, they did a pretty good job. I can't think for myself anymore. Maybe I can help. You know, it occurs to me that you three have something in common. Yeah, we're all in great shape. You're in trouble, all of you. Because you haven't got the guts to get out of it. It's alright for you, Rave. You've got money. Yes... I have. And have you ever wondered why I've got it? Where it comes from? It's your business. It's yours too. You know, when I came back from the war, I realised that while I'd been away the others, the ones who stayed at home, had that chance and took it with both hands. There was money to be made. Lots of money, and they made it. Do you remember how they welcomed us back? They waved and cheered us in the streets but that's about all they ever did for us. Oh, ng, not that old story again. I don't know, Eddie, you take my boss back home now. What are you trying to do, Rave? Play Robin Hood? - Could be. - What do you want us to do? Steal the Crown Jewels? Rob a bank? (CASH REGISTER RINGS) Hey, Rave. You got something on your mind. If it's what I think it is... you're crazy. It needn't concern you, if you don't want it to. There's a young woman who works in that Post Office over there holds quite a responsible position. We've become... rather good friends lately. She gave me this. She's become a little... irresponsible, I'm afraid. £90,000. That's the sum of money involved. Twelve sackfuls of registered packets taken out of the vans and into the Post Office. Only three men, four of us. No violence, just a straight right to the jaw perhaps, nothing more. No violence, just a straight right to the jaw perhaps, nothing more. Transfer the sacks into my car and away. At 11 o'clock. Tonight. Let me get you boys another drink. Same again, please, Molly. Thank you. (CASH REGISTER RINGS) Well? Well what? There are some things I am and some things I'm not. One of the things I'm not is a thief. Neither am I. But aren't you supposed to be in Germany at the moment? That's not what I mean, Rave, and you know it. Alright then. You're a good boy. Are you, Eddie? You behave yourself. You keep the law. And so does Joe and Mike. - You're all three good boys. - What's wrong with that? All the good boys got themselves killed in the war, should've done. The good die young. That's what we were meant to do. You ask the ones who stayed at home. But we didn't die. Oh, no. We fooled them, we stayed alive. And worse than that, we came back. So now we're in the way. We're redundant. We're not wanted. They can't do that to me. I want my share. Then you'll have to take it, Mike. Let them try and stop me. They'll try. And if you fight back, they'll put the law on you. The law? What's the law ever done for me? - Took my thousand quid. - That's what I mean. Look at Joe. You couldn't get a job because of the law. You, with a wife and kid coming. You're speaking nonsense, Rave. Prove it. That's just it, I can't. There are some things I could say that would throw those words of yours into the garbage can where they belong. Right now, I can't think what they are. Maybe I don't want to. You're being a sentimentalist, Eddie. I'm showing you life as it is. And here is an opportunity of living it the way you would like it to be. You're crazy. We're all crazy for even listening to you. Tell me, Rave. How come you wanna steal the money? Because I want to help you. You three are in trouble. Trouble you don't deserve to be in. I want to get you out of it and this way, I can. That's if you want me to, of course. If you don't, oh, well, let's forget about it. (CASH REGISTER RINGS) Well... Guess I'll be going home. What about you two? You must make up your minds. This is your last chance. Do you want a divorce? Do you want to be a one-armed beggar? Do you want your wife to die? (PIANO PLAYS) Over £20,000. Each. We'd never pull it off. You're wrong. We could. We're going to. Now, listen. This is my plan... Why did you have to steal a car? You said we'd use yours. This one's faster. That case on the floor, Mike. Open it. What's this? What's the idea of the guns? I thought you said no violence. I'm not gonna use this, Rave. If you'll do as you're told, you won't have to. (ENGINE STARTS) (BIG BEN CHIMES) (BIG BEN STRIKES THE HOUR) Excuse me, sir. You can't park here. I'm sorry, Officer. (GUNSHOT) What are you doing? (GUNSHOT) Rave! Cut it out! (GUNSHOT) (GUNSHOT) (GUNSHOT) Hello, M2GW. Hello, M2GW. This is 4H calling. This is 4H calling. This is an all-stations call. - No! - Come here! - (GUNSHOT) - (SHE CRIES) (BIRDS SQUAWK) Rave! (GUNSHOT) (VEHICLE APPROACHES) (GUNSHOT) (GUNSHOT) That's it. We can't make it in the car. Then we'll have to take the alternative plan. Grab the sacks and meet me in the churchyard. Everything is arranged there. Mike and I will cover you. Hurry! Right, quick as you can! (GUNSHOTS) (GUNSHOTS) (GUNSHOTS) (GUNSHOTS) Do you want them to take us? Why didn't you fire? You said there'd be no firing. I've always fought clean, Rave. I'm going to give myself up. Don't be a fool, Mike. They'll hang you. I'll take a chance on that. Hold it! (GUNSHOT) (MIKE GROANS) (GUNSHOTS) (BELL RINGS) (CROWD ROARS) ANNOUNCER'S VOICE ECHOES: Four... five... Six... seven... eight... nine... - (OWL HOOTS) - Eddie, I'm scared. What are we doing here? How did we ever get into this mess? I don't know how we got into it. I know one thing, Joe. We're never gonna get out of it. Where's Mike? They've got him. Poor old Mike. I'd sooner any of us than him. What happened? Couldn't you have helped him? I tried to. But a stray bullet got him. Mike was a good guy. What's he doing dead out there? You sure you tried to help him? Or did you think maybe the money could be split three ways? I wanted the money split four ways too. But if it has to be split three ways, that's the way it's going to be. (WHISTLE BLOWS) We've got to get out of here! EDDIE: What'll we do with the money? We'll bury it as planned. Here, take this. We'll come back for the rest later. I'm staying with you full-time until we do. Why? Don't you trust me, Eddie? Sure I trust you. Like I trust myself. (OWL HOOTS) Follow me. (TRAIN RUMBLES) Alright, boys. We go over one at a time. Which are the live rails? The middle one in every three. You go first, Joe. Just watch yourself. You'll be alright. I'll see you on the other side. (TRAIN RUMBLES) Come on! OK, Eddie. You go now. What's the matter? You scared? Just keep over the lines, you'll be alright. It's not the lines I'm worried about. Alright. Follow me. (TRAIN RUMBLES) (WHISTLE BLOWS) (TRAIN RUMBLES) - (EDDIE YELLS) - (HORN BLARES) Eddie! (WHISTLE BLOWS) Come on! (WHISTLE BLOWS) Come on! (TRAIN RUMBLES) We've only one chance. There's a station about a quarter of a mile down this tunnel. Well, what happens if a train comes through? Then we'll be joining Eddie and Mike. Come on! (DISTANT RUMBLE) (TRAIN SCREECHES) (TRAIN RUMBLES) I think we're safe now. You alright? What happened to Eddie? He panicked when he saw that train coming. Tripped and fell over a live rail. I tried to save him but it was too late. Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. And you tried to save Mike too. Why shouldn't Mike have been hit by a stray bullet? Why shouldn't Eddie have tripped? I don't know. I got a look at you back there. You were having a whale of a time. You enjoy killing people, don't you? You love it. All that stuff you were giving us about the people that stayed out of the war. You didn't fight for your country, you fought because every day you could do the one thing that really makes you happy. You could kill. But from now on, as long as I'm with you I'm taking good care of myself. There's £90,000 hidden in that churchyard back there and you and I are the only two people in the world that know about it. How can I be sure you don't want that money for yourself? I don't want any part of it, it's all yours. I got enough to get me and Mary back to the States and I don't want anymore. Oh, no, Joe. We went into this thing together, and you're not walking out on me now. Come on, we've been on this train long enough. ANNOUNCER: Mind the doors... Oh, Joe. Where have you been? I've been so worried. Mary, you better get your things packed. We're going. Going? Where? Home. I've got seats on a plane leaving in two hours. Come on, come on. Let's get going. Don't listen to him, Mary. Don't listen to him! But Joe, how can we go tonight? How did you get the tickets? How did you pay for them? Darling, you're not in trouble, are you? Yes. Yes, that's it! He's in trouble with the police! They're after him. What did I tell you? Get out of here, will you? Get out! You see, Mary, you see? It's true! Be quiet, Mother. Darling, it is alright, isn't it? You've just gotta trust me, Mary. There's not much time, and... We've got to go. Yes, Joe, but why tonight? That's it. Either we go tonight, or not at all. Please believe me. Yes, Joe, I do, but... Don't listen to him, Mary! He's lying. You can't leave me! You can't go away with him now! How about it, Mary? We got 15 minutes. ANNOUNCER: Here is an announcement for passengers on BOAC Argonaut Flight 159 to Nairobi. Will you please have your passports ready and follow the green light to Customs and Immigration. How much longer they gonna be? ANNOUNCER: Passengers on Pan American Flight 201 to New York please proceed to the plane. That's us, darling. We're on our way. I, uh... gotta put something right before I leave the country, I... have to make a phone call. But Joe, we'll miss the plane! No, you go ahead. Grab the seats. No, I'll wait here. I don't like you to leave me. We'll never leave each other again, once we get on that plane. Alright, but hurry. Give me the police. Hello? Yeah. Look, never mind my name and address. I just want to tell you where the money from the Post Office raid is hidden. Ne, no, I'm not... I'm not giving any names. I just want the money to be returned. OK. Take down this address. (PHONE CLICKS) (GUNSHOT) (GUNSHOT) I'm sorry, madam, but we can't wait any longer. Would you mind going on board now? Mary. Joel! Darling, I thought you'd left me. Come on, everyone's waiting in the plane. Let's go, honey. Joe? Joe, what is it? Joel! Mary... Mary... There's... there's not much time before they come. I can't make the plane. - You go. - But what is it? What's happened? You're bleeding! I just got mixed up with the wrong guy... took a chance... didn't work out. I... I love you, Mary. I love you very much. I... I wish... Joel! NARRATOR: Four men. Four women. Four dead men. Buried here forever is what they thought they died for. £90,000. An illusion called money which, in the end, would really have helped none of them would it?
