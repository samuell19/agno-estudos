The first time I heard his singing......I was one year old. I was living with Grandma then. All I ever saw or heard on TV was of a man called "Brother Cheung". This is my Grandma. The man singing on TV is Hong Kong star "Brother Cheung". On this street, everyone calls me "Little Cheung". I already understood a lot when I was nine. My father owns a restaurant to make money. Our Filipino maid is here to make money. My mother plays mahjong in the mahjong parlour for money. And Brother Cheung also goes on the TV charity fund-raisers for money. Of course, I'm no exception. I have known from an early age that... ...money is a dream. It's a fantasy. And it's also a future. You can see why everyone on this street is especially enterprising. What're you doing here? I'm represent your father, I've a right to come and tend to his business. You think you can be cocky because you got the old man behind you? Are we gonna talk or what? Talk all you want ! It began when your mother was still alive in 1985 She used four people's names to buy a shack on the roof of a building. Your parents and you two brothers. Each owns a quarter of the property. When your brother was in studying in England in ' 85 , you underhandedly Don't say ''underhandedly'' . . . . . . he wasn't in Hong Kong, I couldn't reach him. You could've called or written a letter. What letter? Or even a fax. It doesn't matter what you say. What's your is mine too, right? That year, the people on our street were especially restless. Always fighting over money. These two fighting are Mr.Hoi's two sons Some say they once had a very close relationship. And people on our street envied it . I'm not afraid of a lawsuit . What is this, Little Cheung? Ham and egg rice, perfect ! The one eating and not paying is David. The bald one not eating is younger brother Kenny. You want to sue, sue the old man first . . . I just don't want to end up like Brother Cheung. Where's my money? What money? Who ordered the delivery? I ate it , but . . .he ordered it . Why don't you get the money from him, dummy? Little Cheung, you see that? Another year has gone by. My parents, Grandma and I go to see fireworks every New Year. This year, Grandma doesn't feel like going out . Armi , finished! Coming, Grandma. Let's eat lunch! Sit down, let's eat ! Sit down, let's eat ! Little Cheung, Let's eat !Come on, have some more. Ok! Let him help himself . It's alright , I'll wait till you guys finish your meal Have some more.Leave him alone let him get it himself. In fact , I can sue you in the court , you know, Sunday is my holiday. She has to bring up Sunday every time we eat ! It is your HK Government's Law. I want you for this Sunday only. Here, eat more, stop complaining Every Sunday Customer! Come in, sit down. . .Excuse me, are you hiring? We're hiring but we don't hire children. Go home! I'm very good. Little girl, we can't hire you it's against the law. Go home! Can't even have a peaceful meal! Sorry for bothering you. Ridiculous! I can't eat peacefully. I'm going to the toilet . Always go to toilet when you're eating! This girl I'm following is also here to make money. I'm the only kid on this street who . . . . . . knows about making money. I'm wrong . . . This girl called Fan maybe the other kid who knows about making money. My father hired this foreign woman eight years ago to look after my Grandma. Hong Kong people like to hire these inexpensive . . . . . . plain and non-blonde foreign women. I learnt that they're not ''Western-girls'' They're ''Filipino-girls''. ''Zhi Dao Ma?'' ''Zhi Dao Ma?'' Still not right ! It's pronounced this way ''Zhi...'' Extend the sound . . . ''Zhi'' . Some mispronounce it as ''Zi'' . . . it's not ''Zi'' ! There are four sounds to ''Zhi'' . Man Ho, you try it . Zhi . . . Zhi Dao Ma? Sit down Cheung, you try it ! Zhi Dao Ma? Good pronunciation! Zhi Dao Ma? This ''Ma'' can be pronounced lightly. This pronunciation allows you to be expressive. . . . Used bamboo poles to carry the hay, carry less if you're weak. You use a pole to lift them, one bunch on each end. The children carry less can't slack off Children have to work when there's not enough to eat . What about boys? Boys had to work too. . . Must make a living. Everyone had to work. Boys and girls too. You can't say I'm ad ''student'' and not work. You can study but you have to make a living. It's the rule, you have make a living. Can you watch TV? Who had a TV? Nobody had a TV? No TV watching! No TV, didn't even have a radio! Grandma, how did you know Brother Cheung? I've known him since I was nine years old. I followed Brother Cheung after he finished school... Alright , let me read you the newspaper Okay, read me the newspaper. Mother comes to Hong Kong to be a maid . . . I worked overtime without compensation! If you don't talk to your son, I'll sue him in court! Shut up! Shut up! I don't understand. Shut up! Shut up! Hong Kong people are crazy! What took you so long? Had to tidy up! - What're you playing? - The old game. Still playing that? Try this one, this is the newest one. Don't play the old one, this one is more fun. Father won't buy it for me. Excuse me, do you have a Tamagotchi? Tamagotchi? Sold out ! - You want one? Put in an order! - How much? They cost about one thousand in the collector's market. Put down a deposit , okay? Stop mucking about come back to take the money! Little Cheung, what's up? - It's for my mother - Little Cheung, go! Mrs. Gin, delivery Little Cheung, it's for you - Did you tip him? - I tip him? This is for you! ''It's not my food, right?'' - What is it? Speak if you know anything! - I don't know nothing! - How should I know? - Good morning! Get lost . . . I'm asking you, tell me all you know about it . Little Cheung, what're you doing here? Go home, there's nothing to see here. As usual, nobody knows who dumped these babies. After breakfast, I saw a crowd, so I came to check it out . Let's go, there are cops! Cheung, where is your bag? Upstairs, get it yourself ! Grandma, please fight for my overtime money. Go, I'll try to get you the money so worked up for a little bit of money! Let's go, come . . . Little Cheung, your girlfriend? Brother Cheung had bronchitis and was admitted into the hospital last week. He was later transferred into intensive care. This morning, it is reported that Brother Cheung's health has deteriorated . . . . . . this has caused concern in his family . . . Don't you all get sick of being bombarded like this? Not really, Mr.Gin. We want to see whether his family breaks up. Okay, get working! Just let them watch a little bit more! What's there to watch? What do you mean ''Excuse me''? You want to apologize and ''kowtow'' to them too? Is that necessary? I don't care. Time for school! Please pay up! They will pay! You know each other? Mrs.Gin! David, it's you! Happy New Year, haven't paid our respects this year yet. It's kind of late for that New Year stuff ! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! . . . ''Don't bother, I don't have it ! '' Have what? Why are you so stubborn? Try to keep your mouth shut ! Gin has been drinking, he's not talking straight ! I'm talking very straight ! You treat me like I'm not talking straight ! I tell you, I just finished a twenty-four round mahjong game, I lost everything! Give me back my son, then I'll pay you! What has your son got to do with me? Armi , take Little Cheung to school. It's okay, one ran away, you still have another one! Mrs.Gin, a lemonade! Coming! Go to school! Get lost ! What are you sitting here for? No need to pay, just go . . . David, you're out of line, scaring my customers away! Gin, who do you choose, me or my dad? Calm down, David! Your lemonade, enjoy! - Gin's! - Madam. . . -. . . The gangster has gone? - No. No gone. I call the police now? Police? Yes . . . police, welcome . . . Police? Welcome. . . What did she say? Police, I don't know the rest ! Oh, yes, police, of course . . . What else did she say? Come means orgasm. Boss, like in dirty movies. I'm coming! I'm coming . . . ! You idiots, I told you to go to night school! Everybody know ''Yes'' and ''Come'' ! You imbeciles watch too many dirty movies! Mother, what are you doing down here? Grandma, you shouldn't come down all by yourself ! Ridiculous! Where's Armi? Gin, hire another Filipino maid for Grandma! You shut up! Grandma, you take care, I'm leaving now! Where is everybody? . . . . . . Not even a waiter, how do you run your business? Nobody gave us any more trouble after Grandma came in that day. But I got in trouble myself . Ever since my father mentioned about my brother . . . . . . I wanted to find out what happened to him. My parents wouldn't tell me anything. But Grandma dug out all the old photos to show me his picture. Instead, we found lots of Brother Cheung photos. Armi , it's late, why are you singing? Who dug out all these old photos? Armi , who dug them out? - Your mother! - My mother? Do you know why she dug them out? Looking for his brother! His brother? I told him before, he doesn't have a brother! Take Grandma to bed! Put the photos back, okay? Okay! Don't worry about life's failures. Tomorrow is the rest of your life The sun will shine for you and light your path Such is our life, in this world! Gin's restaurant . Yes, tea and egg sandwich? Wah, take care of it ! Yes, coming! Wing Lung building 2B, be there soon. Hurry there and hurry back, you hear me? Wing Lung 2B Gin's restaurant , busy. Ready, who's taking it? Little Cheung, where's your mother? - She went out - Went out? Damn it , hurry there hurry back! - Remember, take cash! - No credits! What do you think of Brother Cheung's family feud? Whose side are you on? Brother Cheung or his wife? You're on her side? She's wrong to . . . Talk to you later! Laujau Li , how are you? Don't worry, it's only Little Cheung! Good morning, Kong! Little Cheung, where're you rushing off to? - What is it? - Are you looking for a job? You came to my father's restaurant for a job. He won't hire you, I'll hire you! If there are tips, you thirty percent , me seventy. What's a tip? - A tip is . . . a tip! - No, a tip is a gift ! No. These are tips! You have any? How about this, you thirty me seventy! It should be you thirty me seventy! That's not fair! It's fair, because I'm the boss! Me thirty you seventy, but . . .Why not fifty-fifty? Forget it ! We should be equal! But you have to obey me! In the end, money was what brought Fan and I together. From that day on, we had a great time. Little Cheung is so smart ! Our activities on the street were strange. But Fan was probably stranger than me. Look at her, she's trying so hard . . . . . . trying to wash dishes like the adults. She's kind of our neighbour and our regular customer. But my dad says we must take cash, no credit ! What's credit? Credit means no money, stupid! Little Cheung, come in! Come in! Put it all over here! New colleague? Here! - We only take cash! - You talk just like our pros! Here, keep it , come back to me when you're older. - Why? - It'll be useful! - Little Cheung, how much? - Thirty-nine. Thirty-nine. - Keep the change - Thanks. Little horse? Little Horse! He is my real Little Horse (Brother Cheung) ! You have a delivery? Did they give you a tip? ''Yes, a dollar! '' Don't be so cheap, give them more! Hurry up! Five dollars, put it away! - Thank her? - Thank me! - Thank you! - Alright , let's go . . . Today's takings . . . Five dollar tips!

Two ten dollars. - We'll take one each - This is yours. Mine. Yours . . . What? Your clothes are dirty! Your clothes are dirty too! You dirty. . . Fan! Fan, come back and help your mother! Fan, hurry up and come back! You can't even concentrate on a bit of work, who were you waiting for? - I wasn't waiting for anyone - You can't go out there! You have to help with the work Five iced teas, one lemonade, six condensed milk on toast . . . - Who ordered it? - David ordered it That asshole, forget it then Mr. Gin, he hasn't given any trouble for a while. Alright , remember, always take cash! - Where to? - Who's delivering? How about Little Cheung, people like him, he's got charisma . . . Shut your mouth! Okay, Little Cheung, hurry there hurry back Remember to take cash! - Where's my little bicycle? - Wah took it . What it is, are you okay? Damn, I spilt it . - What now? - I don't know. They're spilt . - What do we do? - Looks gross! Give it to me. I got it ! What are you doing? Go! Go away . . . You can't look! - Finished? Hurry up! - Not yet ! What's taking you so long? Still not done? - Hurry up! - Done! What is it? It's ''Little Cheung special tea'' . Is it drinkable? Of course, it's for that jerk David. Are you sure? What if he gets sick? If he doesn't die from this, I'll give him shit to eat next time. - It's not very nice! - Let's go! I can't , I have to help my mother! Come on! No, she'll kill me if she finds out ! - Come on! - She will kill me if she knows! - Come on! - I can't go! I have to wash dishes for my mother, there are a lot of dishes today. - Don't tell anyone! - Alright ! Turn around first . Back up. You have to go alone. I'll give you your share but you must keep this secret . ''Little Cheung, it's you! '' - This is David's - Then it's ours too. Don't you have any respect for us? It'd be nice if you really cared about me! Little Cheung, ignore them and bring it up here. Mr. Hoi . Pa, that lousy bunch is so disrespectful. There's one more, iced lemonade. I don't want it .Just pay Little Cheung and let him go. I really don't understand . . . you're the older one, you're supposed to help your brother. Who has been with you longer on this street , him or me? Your brother got an education from abroad he thinks, you fight , it's a great combination. Little Cheung, listen up . . . ...you kill your father if he won't give you an education. That's not the right way to teach kids. - Not the right way? - Of course not ! - What's not right about it? - Little Cheung is just a kid. What do you know about kids? You only know violence! I'm talking to my father, what's it to you? You have to be patient with kids. Patient? Patient? How patient? You can teach him to chop people up but you can't teach him to study. What wrong with telling him to have an education? Be gentler! I'm just teaching him, what's wrong with that? Don't say anymore, I don't want to hear your theories . . . . . . I'll drink my lemonade first ! If your brother can't handle it , you can have it all back! Pa, you said it yourself ! Hey, you heard, you're a witness. - Little Cheung, let's go! - Your goons are outside! Where's my cash? What cash? Get it from your brother on Sunday! Little Cheung, why are you still here? My dad said, I must collect cash! You take this, tell your grandma . . . . . . Mr. Hoi wants to come up and visit her, alright? This is not the first time I'm passing messages for him. I don't know what their relationship was before . . . . . . but I sometimes see Mr. Hoi in the old movies as a side character. On this street , he is pretty well-respected. Mr. Hoi , Mr. Hoi . There's Brother Cheung and Mr. Hoi . Don't watch this anymore. Leave it on, I'm watching. No more, they're all second-rate! Grandma turned the TV off like she had a guilty conscience. I suspect there was something between them. It's raining hard, let's sit down . . . Egg tart? Coming right up! Little Cheung, skipping school? I'm in morning class Little Cheung, don't work in front of Keung. He'll report your father for using child labour. Don't worry! My job is to serve and protect Hong Kong . . . . . . I'm not from the labour department ! Little Cheung, don't worry! You hired anybody yet? That day I was doing my homework in the restaurant . . . Fan tumed around to leave without coming in. It was odd the way she ran away at the sight of the police. I followed her. When I stood in front of her . . . . . . my mind was a blank. The only thing I could do was laugh. She saw me laughing, so she laughed too. I work very fast , please don't fire me! Keep working, don't be a pest ! What's the use of hiring a woman? Stop gawking, go back to work! The old man asked me to run the place. What are you ''running''? Why did you come back? See, the old man is smarter than you, our own people! They only gamble and whore around. Who goes whoring? You, stop! - Did you go to a prostitute? - No. - You sure you never went to prostitute? - No You heard? Anyway, you don't have to bother with the operation here. - Little Cheung, what are you two doing here? - I came to play with him. It's dirty here, go home! Be careful, crossing the streets! All wet ! My mother said her boss is mean, the other one is better. - I think the good one is the older brother - No, he's the younger one - No, the nice one is older - Younger. I have an older brother too but my father kicked him out. - Your brother must be mean and bad - Let's play on the truck. The rain stopped. Stop hitting me. Who do you hate most? Me? I don't know . . . what about you? I hate my parents working all day long. I . . . I hate that jerk David. That asshole David! You kicked me! Kung Fu! Cross arm! You look like a monkey in a circus. Who's that? Little Cheung, did you do that? You mess with the police, I'll tell your father! My father is upset about Brother Cheung's thing and . . . . . . his wife disappearing, how about this? . . . . . . if she shows up, I'll take my father, you . . . . . . and Brother Cheung's kids, and we'll beat her to pulp! Can you ask Mr. Gin . . . . . . Grandma, can you ask Mr. Gin to have your banquet at our restaurant? I'll give you twenty percent off ! Twenty-five percent ! Alright? You want him to pay protection money. No! Don't believe all the rumours out there. You ask them, didn't I grow up on this street too? How could I do such a thing, right? This is final. . .Thirty percent off , alright? You feel better about that , Grandma? Don't watch too much TV, I'm going now! Rest more now! Say goodbye to Grandma . . . Little Cheung! Where did you take your girlfriend? You're all wet Your Grandma will have her birthday banquet at our restaurant . Bring your little girlfriend, too. Come early and play some mahjong. That's settled, let's go! Grandma, I'm leaving! -Where did you two go? - Her name is Fan, this is Grandma. You two are drenched. Look, Fan's clothes are soaked. Your body is all wet. Come out and dry them! - Where did you go? - Playing on the truck. Look at you, all soaked! Dry them off ! What's so funny? Why did you take off my shorts? Don't be shy! He's your brother, take a look. This one? This is your brother. How come he's so young? Let me see. I'll give it to you when you're older. Let me have it now. No, your father said he would burn it all. Let me see. He's so small there. Yes, your father wanted to burn it all. I hid this one so he couldn't get to it . - Did you find him? - No, didn't find him. Couldn't find him. How could I find him? Who is this? This is Brother Cheung . . . Cheung! Armi , bring out the photo album. Bring out the photo album. What's in it? - Who's this? - Brother Cheung, ''Little Horse'' . . . - Isn't his name Tang Wing Cheung? - Of course. I'm Ma Wing Cheung. - Who named me? - Me, of course! It's fantastic! - Is this you? - Yes. You look different ! . . . I'm much older now. I'm eighty-something now. What about this? That's me when I was still acting. What did Brother Cheung do? He has performed for a long time. This one. They have gone crazy about this opera singer. It is all over the place. You know what? TV, magazines . . . it's more fun than a soap drama. HK people call this guy Little Cheung, Brother Cheung, all sorts of names. He is really a super star. Very popular. You know if he dies . . . . . . There'll be more attention than when Deng Xiaoping died. I performed with Brother Cheung back in those days. Our most popular piece was ''General Kwan & Diu Zen'' . Brother Cheung was General Kwan, you know? Of course he was great , he killed people. You know who played Diu Zen? If it was me, I wouldn't have had to avoid that ''vixen''. I wasn't as pretty as her. That ''vixen'' was prettier. She was opera singer, and she landed Brother Cheung. - What about Mr. Hoi? - Hoi , he was just an extra! You were really that famous? Of course, Brother Cheung was my partner. No big deal, it's all history now. - Who's your idol? - Tamagotchi ! I don't have one, but my mother likes Teresa Tang. ''Not bad, she was a beauty. '' She could sing, could move, but she couldn't somersault . What a pity! Grandma, I'm leaving. - Take care, bye-bye - Bye-bye. Hey, Mr. Gin. - You were on the phone for so long! - Sorry, it was my husband. Where's Little Cheung? - He's asleep - Remember to check whether he's warm enough. Also, don't watch TV so late. Not me, your mother. Alright , bye-bye. Your son is blaming me again. Grandma, July 1st , I want to use the five day holiday to go back to the Philippines. I haven't seen my husband for a long time. Go ahead! Thank you Grandma, you tell your son please . . . The plane ticket is expensive, I can use the money to hire people. How much does your husband make? I have two maids at home. One driver, two children. - My husband doesn't work - You're stupid! Little Cheung, I didn't order anything. Do you know this person? If Grandma didn't have this only photo of my brother I wouldn't know how good-looking he was. Grandma said my brother was like a wounded bird . . . . . . no different from anyone on the street . He couldn't fly out of here. I don't care, if I had a brother to protect me . . . . . . I wouldn't be scared of the mean people. Is this Hang? Brother, look! It's really Hang! What does your brother look like? I don't know, my father kicked him out when I was three. Your mother must've been heart broken? I think Grandma was sadder. . . . but Grandma loves me too. It's late and your brother is still not here. There's still no sign of him. Yeh? No. - It's late, I've got to go - Wait a little more. No, my father will kill me. - Why don't we watch the stars? - There are no stars here. There are stars where I come from . . . . . . You open your eyes, there are stars everywhere. You can even reach out and touch them. There are stars here and I can touch them too. Yours are not real, I'd rather look at this side. What's so special about touching them with your hands? I can touch them with my feet . Yeh, I got it ! Yeh! Fan, look! Uncle Fat , what was it? Gang fight , it's none of your business. When? That night , someone did appear . . . . . . but I don't remember anything. All because Fan wanted to leave. 1 , 2, 3 , Traffic light . Cross the road. Be careful! Little Cheung, Little Cheung, get up! - I'm tired - Wake up! Grandma got the news about my brother from me. She was so excited. Someone said she walked on the street without a cane . . . . . . and she was taking big steps. I don't believe it , I just don't . The poor maid was crying on the balcony for a whole hour. She got a call from her neighbour . . . . . . saying that her husband had a mistress. Mister, do you have a white Tamagotchi? Yeh, it's over a thousand dollars. How much exactly? Around a thousand two hundred and ten. I have it . I only have one thousand one hundred. Thousand one? Let's see! . . . . . . Alright , deal! - You try getting on the bike - It'll fall. It won't fall. Can you do it? You know how to get on? Come teach me. I told you to learn how to get on first . You go it? Try one more time. Like this, you've got to run a few steps. Be careful That should be the end of it for now. Mr. Gin, I'll go on for a while! - How old are you? - Five years old. Where are you going with your mother? Hong Kong. - Are you scared? - Very scared. His mother had tried to sneak into HK three times already. She had succeeded to cross the border in the last two attempts. Many of the illegal immigrants are related For example, this fourteen year old girl is the sister of this ten year old boy. They are helpless the little boy cried out in fear while being detained. - What are you thinking? - I want to go home . . . Why do you want to go home? - What the hell? - It's not right . Yeh, the count has been off for a while. - That's impossible -Wah, the count has been wrong recently? Two, four, six, eight . . . Who had an accident this time? I don't know, Wah, can you see? Who is it? Mr. Gin, you should ask Laujau Li . He would know who has died in the world. Isn't that Kenny? Yeh? - How are you ... - This is my wife. Mrs. Kenny is expecting . . . Congratulations! Come in and sit down. - I'm leaving -Where are you going? I'm no longer in charge of our business, my brother has taken over. Without you here, you brother and I won't to get along. You're going to do fine. At least your child will be born outside of Hong Kong. - Why not sit down for a cup of tea? - We're rushing to the airport . We should let you go. Remember to send us a photo when your child is born. Come back to see us Of course, we won't forget you. - See you later - Bring your child back to visit us. Take care of yourselves. Mr. Lee, I'm happy that you help me level things out between my two sons. . . . I'll pay your fee soon. Alright , thank you. Mr. Ma! Mr. Hoi ! - What're you doing? - Your order. Did you say goodbye to Kenny? Kenny left and he' s not coming back. He said Hong Kong is not fun. Little Cheung, the other day I asked you about your grandma... . . . What was her reply? - Grandma said no - Is that all? Grandma is not happy. Brother Cheung has a big family feud. I'd be surprised if she could sleep. At least she can get up early to exercise. Exercise, like this. Not like that , like this. That's right . What do you know about being old? I'm having tea, you want some? Kung Fu tea. It'd be different if Kenny was running the show. No need to consider, your mother promised already. David would blame me if you don't do it at our restaurant this year. That's your family's business. I understand. You're right, I understand. I know, please consider it . Twenty-five percent? No! . . . . . . The market is so bad, I can get that deal anywhere. Fifty percent off , I'll pick up the rest myself . Mr. Hoi , so you . . . Don't tell David about it . It's my gift to your mother. I thank you on behalf of my mother. Looks like you got a good deal, ''Mr. Hoi this, Mr. Hoi that'' . . . Even he's afraid of David, what is the world coming to? I heard something . . . I don't want to know, I'm not interested in his affairs. You get upset every time I mention Hang's name. The other night, Hang brought a big gang to negotiate with Kenny. What do I care? I disowned him a long time ago . . . What he does has nothing to do with me! Maybe this has something to do with you! - Fan, look out for me! - Alright . Do you know what Mr. Hoi drinks? I think it's Kung Fu tea. It's''Little Cheung special tea'' The best Kung Fu tea. - Hurry up! - Watch out for me. Alright , hurry up! Alright . - Hurry - what's taking you so long? Almost done. Done. Your turn! You done? - Can I pass? - No! No pee, no pay! Hurry up! Fan, you again? Where're you going? - I . . . I'm going to work - Work. See you, Fan. David.

I believe David will get punished some day. I learnt that you can nourish certain organs by eating right. Grandma was always making special soups for my father. That's why I was born very smart.

I'll help you get him back. Here! Found it ! You know what this is? I don't know. This is a tea bag the vampire left behind. It's for jerks to drink. You put it away, next time you see David drinking . . . If he drinks it , he'll have diarrhea, headaches, fevers . . . Give it to me! Boss, it's your turn. What's the hurry? Boss, you're something else, you even drink the tea bag! Tea bag? Little Cheung, why's there a tea bag in the lemonade? Come out ! Making deliveries and making money was my special skill... but I didn't given up on finding my brother. One day someone told my father about it . . . and interrupted my money making routine.

I think that girl is a Little Snake illegal immigrant! - How do you know? - Can't you tell? I know it was because of me that Grandma didn't go out anymore. She had been out of the house only twice since last winter. I ran away to scare him. Of course I wouldn't disappear indefinitely like Brother Cheung's wife. the beloved Brother Cheung has passed away. Come watch the news, Brother Cheung died! - Of all the times, why did he have to die now? - All the guests have arrived. I told you to bring her down yourself ! What about you? Why didn't you go? She's your mother! You know she doesn't like me. She comes down by herself every year. It's nine o'clock, why don't you call her? - This is going to be bad! - I'll call her if you don't ! You go call her and I'll cover this end! She won't move. She doesn't want to go! I don't know. She is watching TV. Yeah. You know, New Horse Baby died. - Grandma. . . - I'm not going! I'm not in the mood, I want to watch TV! It was all your fault , you couldn't even watch a kid. This family has so many problems! I don't know what to do with her! She just won't come down. What's happening? Ten o'clock, Grandma is still not here? Mr. Hoi , you tell me what to do. Gin, it's your mother's birthday today. If everyone starts their banquet this late like you... we'd be out of business. Forget it , I'll go up to get her. Pa, you taught me not to mess with other people's business. Gin, I'm giving you five minutes and that's it . Fine, quit bothering me! Start the meal! Dinner, stop playing everyone! She's not here but you can dedicate a song to her.

Let's eat , it's almost ten! Take your seat . What do you think of Brother Cheung's death? I want Mrs. Cheung to go home. Family shouldn't be fighting among themselves. Did this have a negative effect on Hong Kong? Of course, people want to remember Brother Cheung as great performer. . . and not the way his family fought for the inheritance. Delivery! Thank you, sixty-seven dollars. - Sixty-nine, two dollars tip for you. - Thank you! Mister, are you from Gin's restaurant? Yes, Gin's Is Little Cheung back yet? He's disappeared, I don't know where he is. Are you Fan? Little Cheung asked me to see you. They're watching you. . . you spend all your your time riding. This is Kowloon City. There's lots to eat here and lots of planes. I've seen it on TV. I told you there were lots. That's the peak. That's the Bank of China. This is Central Statue square.

Dammit , you want to rebel? You learnt to run away, huh! Sleep in a coffin? I gave up on your brother a long time ago. What am I supposed to do if you follow in his footsteps? You got a bad attitude! Why don't you punish me? I was the one who told on him! Punish you? I thank you! The whole street knew about it , except me. Dammit ! What is this? I warn you, don't move without my permission! - Forget it , Gin. - Don't try to help him! I'll strip you naked. Let's see if you will run! The cold is making me tremble! It pierces into my heart . . . You won't be happy until you've killed your son? My legs give out and I stumble As I stagger, I feel my body. . . teeter and totter. I hope you ladies and gentlemen. . . . . .will find it in your heart to be generous. My heart is broken, my luck ran out ! The wheel of fortune turned. . . and I ended up blind! What're you singing? I'm warning you, don't go to see Fan again. She's an illegal immigrant , you know that? Madam, please help me! Can you spare a little change! My emotions run high, I'm at the end of my rope. There is no hope, just let my life expire. One should regret nothing in life and death. Except I regret that my father has not returned.

I'll go with you, come out . . . Come, don't be scared. Come with me. I didn't see Little Cheung again after that day. But everyone on this street , including my father. . . thought I was Little Cheung's girlfriend. His problems became my problems. I know Little Cheung would hate me for what I did that day. My heart was divided. . . His father was furious and I just wanted him to return him. Why didn't he want to go home? Why do they have their hands raised? Who ordered them to do that? I didn't tell them to do it , they did it themselves. Lower your arms. . . All of you, lower your arms! Who ordered them? Who do you think we arresting? Get those Filipino maids away. Get down and don't move. Right , come over here. . . Over here, nice and easy, one by one. Hey, what're you looking at? How old are you? - Three years old. - Three? Identification? Show me your ID! Partner. . . sorry, sorry. . . He's a local, he lives on this street . - A cocky little local? - I'm sorry. . . Little Cheung, relax and don't stare at him. He's one of the most loyal people in show business. A stand-up guy! And he has participated in the most charity shows among us. - Are you Mr. Gin? - Yes, aren't you Fan's father? Yes, I've come for Little Cheung. He's doing his homework in there. Are you Little Cheung? You know Fan? She asked me to give you this. - And also to thank you. - Mister. Forget it , it's been so long. Come over with Fan some time. The girls and their mother have moved away. You're watching Brother Cheung? Stay for a while! I'm busy, I'll watch it at home. My mother said we'll be Hong Kong residents after July 1st . Then we'll get Hong Kong ID's. My sister and I won't have to hide at home. Why don't we count down? Ten, nine, eight , seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Victory! The sun was very hot that day. Your mother's stomach hurt . Your dad and I called emergency right away. I went to make the call. . . when I was calling, your mother gave out a scream. And your brother shot out of her like a rocket . Luckily your mother was sitting on a stool. The baby didn't get hurt that badly. I had never seen anything like that . Your brother shot out and slid across the floor. . . Your father and I were shocked. It was so slippery. . . He slid from the living room in to the kitchen. He stopped when he hit that wall. He started crying when he stopped. Your father and I picked him up. Your brother's face was full of cuts We were all laughing. When the doctor arrived Your mother was still shaken up. The doctor said. . . Your son really wanted to come out and see the world! I thought , the world is so complicated, who wants to see it? Grandma picked that night to leave Little Cheung while he was sleeping. She took the memories of Little Cheung and Brother Cheung with her. Little Cheung's dad had a banquet at Mr. Hoi's restaurant . He said Grandma made it to eighty-years old. . . and she had a joyous burial. News about David was all over the neighbourhood. He had lost his aura. His gang had left him. He had dark circles around his eyes. He was wearing a leather jacket in the summer. He even shaved his head to look cool. The worst thing was everyone ignored him. Little Cheung. Stop playing, Little Cheung! Stop playing. Come here. Brother Cheung loved this. Burn it for Grandma. I burn for Grandma. Whatever, just do it . On the seventh night of mourning, Little Cheung was burning paper for Grandma. . . He saw something. . . and ran towards it . There was no one there. But I know. . . there were two people watching them from a distance. Little Cheung's grandma left and now his maid was leaving too. Armi was strong. On the day Grandma died. . . And when she left Little Cheung she didn't cry either. Maybe she was used to it . Listen, bye-bye Study hard. Don't be sad, I will come back. Let her go. Be a good boy! Cheung, be a good boy. Let Armi go. Armi has to go home. Goodbye, Little Cheung. Don't go. Don't go! Goodbye, Armi ! We'll take you to visit her some day. Stay here, your mother is here. Don't cry, we'll visit her some day. In anticipation of our return to our motherland. . . today we'll learn about the raising of the national flag. The flag of the People's Republic of China is red. . . and is made up of four small stars and one large star. Three students from our school have been selected to raise the flag. They have been learning the procedures from students in the mainland. We'll observe the procedure now. Please begin. Let me explain the flag of . . . . . .The People's Republic of China. The PRC national flag is red. . . . . .with four small stars and one large one on it . The four small stars surround the large one. . . . . .symbolizing the people supporting the Communist Party. Most students in mainland are in the Young Pioneers They perform ceremonial duties. Let us now observe the salute. Lower the hand. The teachers will now show you. Raise the right hand, straighten them out . Raise the hand past the top of your head. We'll repeat it and please follow my example. Salute! Good, lower your hands. One more time. Salute! Grandma! Grandma, give me some money, I want a chicken! - How much is it? - One thousand dollars. One thousand dollars is a lot ! Ask your father. I'll give it to you if he doesn't . Little Cheung told me. . . . . .the people living in the old HK buildings have a lot of stories. I'm sure Mr. Hoi was Grandma's boyfriend. Little Cheung and I heard Grandma talk about . . . . . .the story of Genenal Kwan and Diu Zen. I still haven't seen the movie. Sometimes I wonder. . . . . .maybe she wasn't Brother Cheung's partner... . . .but the vixen she was always talking about . Little Cheung, you're still up? Why? Watching TV, sit down. This is the real Bruce Lee - Little Cheung! You're the fake one! - I'm the real one! - You're fake! - Real! - A fake is a fake! - I'm real! - He's the real one. I'm the real Little Cheung! - You're fake! - Real! Let's not argue. Let me do your Grandma's walk. You imitate her well Little Cheung. You're great ! Thank you Lord for all the things you've done in our lives. Although we have endured the heat today. But we feel the heat of your love. Oh mighty God! With the beauty of your holy name. I will worship for you. Oh mighty God! With the beauty of your holy name I will wait for you! I will wait for you, oh mighty God! With the beauty of your holy name. I will worship you. Oh mighty God! With the beauty of your holy name. I am blessed. I am blessed. Everyday of my life. I am blessed. When I wake up in the morning and when I go to sleep at night. I am blessed. I am blessed. Let us continue praising the Lord. And dance. Let us stamp our feet . Let us turn around. I will sing and dance for you. Come on, Hallelujah! - Good news, Mrs. Gin! - What news? That jerk David is going into the hospital. Really? Laujau Li would know. That's worth a look. That ambulance is outside their restaurant . Take a look if you don't believe me. Stop chatting! Get back to work! To the back alley. Nosy! I may as well see him off ! Kong, what happened? I heard David fainted up there. Diabetes! You got here before me! Kong, what happened? Diabetes. Why would he have diabetes? He had too much of your teas! He got diabetes from drinking tea. You drink our teas too? Yes. I drink your teas but I don't do evil things. Fan! Little Cheung, where are you going? - Fan is on that car? - She didn't move away! Get on the bike! Be careful! The damn David! David, your day has come! Fan! Little Cheung! I thought Little Cheung came to say goodbye. But he was chasing the ambulance. That was the end of our friendship. And the end of our childhood. I will always remember my happy times with him in Hong Kong. Too bad, I couldn't spend that summer with him together! What do you want? Where's Fan? Little Cheung! Little Cheung! You came to see me? Why did you come to see me? You're so good to me. Nobody on the street cares about me. You're so good to me. . .
