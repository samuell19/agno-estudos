This whole game is about the food chain, man. We all are a part of it. Grasshoppers eat grass. Then the grasshopper's eaten by a rat. Then the bloody snake is going to slither in and eat up the rat. And at the very end, will come the hawk, flying in from the sky. It'll grab the snake and eat it up. That completes the food chain. No humans in the food chain? Yes, of course.- - How is that? Humans don't eat hawks! Trained hawks used to sit on sailors' arms on ship decks. Wearing all the smuggled chains around its neck. Whenever there was a custom's raid, it used to fly around for sometime and come back; that bugger! Humans don't eat hawks. They consume the hawk's opinion of right and wrong. Humans tame hawks, Inspector Laltoo Das. Yes but not all hawks can be tamed, right? Can be killed but not tamed. Err.. you're talking about your uncle man, huh? By God! That man was something else. Now listen man, listen to me. Okay? 4 shops are yet to pay, 26, 7, 8 and 31 3 warehouses in Gunj...- - Hey! Do the counting later. Just say it's ten lacs. Easy guys, easy on the guns. Hang on, I'm talking, give me a minute. Now listen motherfucker, I don't know where and how... just get us the fucking ten lacs, okay! Kidnap people, loot a bank, call the Syndicate. Call Basheer, Qasim, Rani, whoever, just get us the ten lacs!- - Tony, disconnect.- - Huh? Disconnect, bro. Why did you ask him to disconnect? Are you the leader?- - What! Are you the boss of the gang? Bugger! Why do you care? If you...- - You guys won't do anything. Standing with your guns pointed at a wrong angle for 2 hours! Not a drop of bloodshed yet! You do your kidnapping with these idiots? - You!- - Shut up you moron! I don't know whether to laugh or cry at your audacity! Do you even know who you've picked up? You think I am a petty pick-pocket? So you're asking for ten lacs only! Tony... call the Syndicate. Tell them these guys have a new demand. Fifty lacs.- - But Zulfi bhai...- - Within 4 hours. "Or you'll find Zulfiqar Ahmed in pieces, in a sack near Ghasia Mosque." - But seriously, man! Fifty lacs!- - Just call. Do it, will you? This area. A small country inside the city of Kolkata. Yes, a country. Only, without a national anthem and a flag. They have their own language, economic system, law and order. Even today, the police does not enter some of those areas. Keep that in mind. And they have their own politics. They hardly care about political parties or ideologies. It's all handled by certain big shots. What the residents of this area think about you is the main thing. That's it. The rest is like the Mango and Hilsa fish... seasonal. The Left might turn Right the Answer might be the Question. The compass is confused. Lemon tea? No...- Have the tea. Habits also need a handover like the files. Dulal! Ask Puchke to send in two cups of lemon tea. And... when is Mr. Akhtar sending the car? Around 4 o'clock.- - There's time then. Go. So, as I was saying... the areas economy, their income and expenditure... depends upon various kinds of business. Some of it, legal and... most of it as the locals call, 'un-legal'. From supplying coolies to stevedore companies for unloading the ships, to renting out godowns to dump the stuff there. Corruption, commission, and huge monetary transactions are predominant. The parking charges for the trucks, renting out slums to the coolies, all of it is a huge business. And after the Nancy market opened in 1970, a new avenue opened up. Trading of smuggled goods. Goods stolen from ships, containers or from the warehouses, being sold in an open market. An entire area's commercial system formed around this trade. Funny thing is... This is Puchke. After him. Sir, are you leaving? Yes, transferred. I'll come down sometimes. And control your drinking. Or else you'll get a thrashing. So, what was I saying? About the 'system'. Yes, the 'system'. This system has many partakers. You'll understand that when a ship is mauled. Mauled? When government declares a ship to be unfit, it is put up for auction. Then the buyer breaks it down into pieces and sells it off. But dismantling the whale sized ship, competing in the auction to make a buy, all this needs a lot of help from various people. Political leaders, the police, owner of the Coolie Supply Association, the leader of the Coolie Union, Custom officers, Port Trust officers, the Truck Drivers' Association, goons, container breakers.. Ship builders, slum builders etc. Naturally, each of them has a profit share. So, the empire is run by many parties and sharerholders together. Some help actively, some passively, right? Correct. And this group of people is unofficialy called... the Syndicate. Which is present in each and every alley of this area. A gigantic spider with its legs inside each and every kind of trade. And exactly like the spider's web, every trade is interconnected to form the Syndicate's web. But, you see spiders eat their own babies too. As in? No one ever came back alive after opposing the Syndicate. 1984, DC Port, K. V. Sharma. Not at all! He was a natural enemy, one of them had to die. The dangerous thing is, the Syndicate doesn't even spare its own members. How is that? Whenever a member of the Syndicate becomes popular, when people start revering him, his days are numbered. That's what I was telling you. Whoever is the people's favourite, has all the power. The Syndicate dosen't let the power go to a single person. So, one has to be a wolf in a pack. One can't be a lion. Once, someone did become a lion. 1990, Nawabzada. Very secular. A father figure to all... Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. Immensely popular and powerful. He was shot on the day of Rathayatra Festival. Syndicate? 1997, Ram Singh or Ramaiya, same problem. Though he was the messiah of Hindus... he became a strong-arm member of the Syndicate. He was bombed to pieces in front of his own house. Bombed? More to come. 2001, a coolie supplier named Akbar, became a big don. They say the Syndicate provoked a issue to get this guy killed. And finally, it was Zulfiqar's turn. Hmm. After whom, the whole face of the Syndicate changed. Zulfiqar Ahmed. Still remember. He got kidnapped while in the middle of the river. You can understand how complicated the scene was. I sent Danish Bashar, who looks after the truck parking, to Basheer. And I went straight to the Syndicate's meeting. Basheer Khan? Zulfiqar's friend and partner in crime. A gangster to some, a brother to some. And... immensely sensitive regarding his nation, India. A huge patriot! Basheer bhai, come fast! They've kidnapped Zulfiqar. And Tony and Markaz too! The river police and pirates of the area where Zulfiqar was kidnapped... were controlled by Parvez Maqsood. The other members of the Syndicate were pressurising him. Kashinath Kundu, goon turned promoter. Used to rent out Port Trust land as godowns and slums. Kaushik Sinha, Customs officer. Was so corrupt hardly bought anything with his salary ever. Sharafat Qasim, right hand man of the local politician. Ex-goon. Shishir Tili, the owner of Gunj's brothel. The philosopher kind, quipping proverbs. Tribhuban Gupta, Port Trust officer. A weak spine. He was in the Syndicate to avoid troubles, not only for the bribe. Mithilesh Sikdar, supplied coolies to stevedore companies, to carry the goods from the ships to warehouses. Lastly, Pavel Latif, the boss of the warehouses and container breakers. I swear Basheer bhai! I don't know what or who's behind this! What are you saying! Nothing. All we know is, we need your help to get him out of that area. Just tell me what to do and how. Have I ever refused? Then call your men up. If anything happens to Zulfiqar bhai...- - Fine, cool it. Not only men, we need the money too. 50 lacs. Who'll give that? Kaushik's question's stumped all. Because all the finacial dealings, transactions and fund maintainance, were handled by Tony Braganza. Who, along with Zulfiqar's right hand man Markaz Ali, was also kidnapped. So, for the funds they had to go to Rani Talapatra. Rani Talapatra, the widow of late Tamal Talapatra. So, are you married? Huh? Ceremony, merrymaking, feast, etc? No. Girlfriend? Yes. Careful. I've seen the strongest fall for the trap. The saying, "How the mighty have fallen!" Remember that song by Kishore Kumar? About the complicated character of women? - But her character is quite... - Anyway, that's your personal matter. So I was talking about Rani Talapatra. She was an young widow, needing nothing but security. When her husband died, amongst a lot of debt, eveyone pounced on the bar. Zulfiqar entered the scene. Then the debtors just vanished. And in return, Rani became Zulfiqar's... girlfriend. Mistress, actually. Tatin, Khemu.. Will she pay up? Of course! Ira, Madan, Chameli, you too. But Ma'am, I was saying... It seems no one trusts us in Mrs. Talapatra's family. Great! No, someone does. He is in a fix at this moment. But you guys don't seem to...- - They've asked for 50 lacs. The Syndicate doesn't have that much. - And the police? Not doing anything? What will the police do? But that comes later. First we need the money. Gunj is going through a recession. Very few visit the whorehouse. I have to feed many mouths. But still I've contributed all that I could. Now the family must come in. So I am family now? We can argue about that later. The point is...- - You know his family's condition, Ma'am. His wife remains doped out, can't wake her up. You know how Zulfi squanders, there's no money at home. Not a penny. Tony is not here too. So we came to you. Basheer bhaijaan, everything I have is Zulfiqar's. Wait, I'll get it. Just one condition. You've to be there in the rescue team. Why? The rest of us are enemies? Qasim! Would've gone anyway. Zulfi is in trouble. And I won't go? Masood, this is the place, right? That's what Parvez bhai said. 'Jh' six, 'Jh' seven, 'Jh' eight, 'Jh'... Greetings, Zulfi! You've started counting, as usual! What else? I was getting so bored sitting here. Hey, got the entire amount? Did you expect instalments?- - Shut up, give the money! Release them first. What don't worry! What do you mean by that? 50 lacs is no small amount. Lot of money man! Shishir Tili gave 5 lacs. But thankfully won't charge an interest. Danish's donation for the Syndicate fund is due since last month. Rani has given 25 lacs and if he tells Kashi...- - Basheer, everything's ok but...- - But what? - No fun and frolic! Hey! Hello people, wait. Nothing of that nonsense is happening. I'm telling you, huh! The boat won't turn! Are you mad? - Correct! Why must the boat turn? Men who have dignity, not boats. So men must take care of it.. Zulfi bhai, shut up! Sorry but please shut up eh? Masood, ask him to speed up the boat! What say, Basheer? - What 'Basheer?' For Christ's sake guys. What rubbish! I give up. Go to hell, you guys! A favourite poet of mine. If I may quote him, There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken at the flood leads on to fortune. Ommitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. Hey! Basheer bhai.. Zulfi Bhai... - Goddamit man! Arrgh! Hey, hold this! Zulfi, watch out! Where were you? Come on! Enough fun and frolic? Happy? What the fish was that! Can't you keep a watch? Did you give her food? Yes- - Medicines on time? Yes, did. All of you lazy morons. I was just gone for two days. Begum... Begum! Begum. Where were you all these days? Did you bring 'Sewai' from the market? Sewai.. from the market? Come. You think I can't handle your worries. What is this crisis? That you can't share with me? Recently got some mails.. Some spies gave me the news. Some Lashkar terrorists are trying to enter the country through here. Some Syndicate members are involved in this. Have you informed Zulfi and Markaz? Kashinath? Whom to trust and whom not to... I am confused. This isn't about gangwar, police, politics or smuggling. The country is in danger. Basheer... I need to tell you something about the family. Came to know of it. Doing the rumor mills.. Was unaware of it all these years. Danish told me. Investigated about it. It's true. What is it? Forget it. Basheer... you already have a lot on your plate. Moreover, I don't feel good about telling you this. Rather, I'll ask Danish... to tell you when he can. We all know... how, by fighting all odds, peeing on the face of Death, how... Zufliqar bhai has home returned, fighting alone! Our own boy has returned home. Now there will be security and peace in the area. So we're honouring him with... where are the flowers? We are honouring him with flowers! Hail Zulfiqar bhai! Hail! Hail! Zulfiqar bhai! Yo brother! You're coming or what? Ah! Come on man! Zulfi bhai will wait for us. If you go to the ring directly, what'll I do there alone? Play bloody referee to Zulfiqar bhai and Rani? Sorry! Sorry! Sorry my man, sorry. My brother from another mother, I'm really sorry. You lovers have some serious issues, man! You'll sit home singing sad songs all day. Then you take it out by killing people, breaking their jaws! If it's bothering you go tell Zulfiqar bhai, "Zulfiqar bhai... your girlfriend... What! No! No... thats not happening man. No, that is just not happening. In the name of Jesus, thats not happening. You think I'm mad? I'll go translate your words to Zulfiqar bhai? No way! I want to live man, don't want to get fucked in the wrong place. No! Get off bugger.. Oh hello! What do you take me for man, bloody idiot or what? Hey! Okay okay! Fair enough, okay!- - Where are you off to? Zulfi bhai.. Oh bloody hell! Hey, lets go out! Come in! Come on in, my champion! Ready? Rani says today's odds are very high. The Syndicate and the bar will bleed if you lose. Are you sure or should I send someone else? What's this, Zulfi bhai? You call me a 'Champion' and doubt me as well? Can still doubt myself but never you, Markaz. Remember it. Shall we make a move? People are waiting. Yes, let's go. Who'll you gamble on tonight?- - Markaz bhai of course! Markaz bhai will be beaten tonight! You will see! Have you seen his physique? Markaz! Markaz! Markaz! Kill him, man! Fight, Markaz! Yes! Yay! My lion. My Champ!- - Go get him, man! Markaz! Markaz! Markaz! Look out! Punch him! What the... Shut up! You motherfucker! What's the point of the Syndicate if my brother has to rot in the lock-up? Don't look at me. It's the Syndicate's decision. Oh come on! How's it the Syndicate's decision? No voting happened. But Mr. Mithilesh, that's right, we decided to stay out of drugs. Mr. Kaushik, a small kid made a mistake, that's it. He just started a new business...- - He's not a kid. He can tell between weed, hash, cocaine & heroin. You must've leant the difference at home too, right? Hello! You watch it man.- - Enough of this Pablo story. Anything else? Pablo is not a story, Basheer bhai, he's my brother. Okay, cool, we'll come to this later. Parvez is waiting to tell us something. Order please? I have a proposal, guys. No chance of a loss. Rather, huge opportunity to earn big bucks. Shelter for 3 people & false passports. Who are they? Where are they from? They're from Afghanisthan. How much will they pay?- - 5. What rubbish! Not enough for so many of us. The black gang operations have dropped. You find everything everywhere, no extra income! No ship-mauling since long! I'm talking about 5 crores.- - What! Who are these people? They are from the Lashkar gang. They'll go to Mumbai. Wow! What next? Will auction your family? Hold your tongue or I'll bury you...- - Save your fight for later. Know the risks of letting in terrorists?- - Not terrorists. They're Jihadis. Sorry to burst your balloon, Mr. Parvez, but all this crusade and religious war, is complete bullshit and nonsense. All that matters to people on the road is their daily food. Which road are you talking about, Tony? India's or Hindustan's? Heart's bleeding for Islam, right Parvez? Fine, let the Jihadis in. Let blasts happen. But remember this, forget a Musliam person, even if a Muslim cat is killed.. I'll make sure you'll have no use for virgins in heaven.. Send your hands back to school, Parvez. They're too arrogant. We don't need to do all of this, right? Let's hear what the Syndicate decides? That alright. But all this will invite the media, the police & raids. Don't think we need that. If you ask me, I'm dead against it. What say, bro? Markaz too. Crusades are bad for the business. A riot breaks out and you're gone. Hmm, Qasim? There's good money but the risk is quite high too. Zulfiqar bhai? Hmm? Hmm? Whatever the Syndicate decides. You're coming to the party, right? Party's thrown by the nephew.. Uncle, I understand but what's his fault? Yes, I know. Everything is your fault. That's the reason why you are punishing yourself. Right? The fault is neither the uncle's nor nephew's. And my friend Romeo, not yours too. If it's someones fault, then.. Okay, okay yes! I know. Come to the party. I'll feel out of place. Plus Akhtar invited us so many times. Markaz, you should've been here man. You've no idea about the weather in Kolkata. Hey! How are you? Good to see you man. HI! All well?- - Yes. Hey!- - Hello, Tony! How are you- - Where is Markaz bhai? Good to see you man, how are you? Markaz will be here soon. Hello! - Hi, Tony! - H.. Hi! Oh my God! So good to see you. How've you been? Good. I have been good. Where is uncle? Won't he come? And Markaz? Yes, Zulfi bhai is a little busy. Coming in a bit. And you know Markaz. He will come later. My brother told me you'll be coming late. Aa.. it's kinda late I guess, right?- - No! You should know you're not in Paris anymore, studying. Someone hasn't changed. This is not late, Tony! Come, my brother as usual is rocking the party. Oh really? You look great.- - Thank you! Our houses break apart Our swords get rusty A little water to quench our thirst It drenches our clothes How far do we go on? Our houses break apart Our swords get rusty A little water to quench our thirst It drenches our clothes How far do we go on? As far as we can call out to The sailor prances on waves further away We lose our way We lose our way back home Our smiles blossom In someone's garden Why the waters cries out In the middle of the night We lose our way Why can't we go back home? Who's home remains unscathed? Take me to their place Mismatched faces and bodies Take me home I know Tony's not home. He doesn't like me. Please Markaz, why don't you understand? I was sunk in debt. Debtors were like vultures. If Zulfiqar sahab were not there... Your wound... More I float away Towards poetry More I feel the monotony of life My love for you is clandestine I must return everytime I kiss your cheeks The more I escape the crowd The more I fail To respond to your calls A strange slumber fumes my eyes I stay awake Why do I sit like An open window? The clock keeps ticking, Mimicking several voices I'll never know how many boxes I'm spilt into There's someone I call Who's home is unscathed? Take me to their place Come on!- - What happened? - Tell me what happened?- - You don't talk much. Don't you dare touch me! Guys, please! Get the local support and the Syndicate, that's it. Syndicate will help you in all possible ways. Run! Escape from the back! Hey! Guys, what is wrong with you! Hello! Sit down guys, please everybody! Come on, leave him! Back off you jerk! - Get out! - What's your problem, man? - Hey! You bugger! - Tony relax! You jerk! Now I'll show you...- - Please stop fighting! Sorry, it was a mistake. What sorry man! This isn't your uncle's area. Trying to impress girls eh? Tony, no bloodshed please! Forget what happenend! Guys, please...- Guys, aim your machines at him. And aim well. If you miss, he will push this broken bottle... through your arse. And mind you it'll hurt a lot! Masood, upstairs! Move forward. Zulfi! Run, come this way! So, friends... not only for the people of this area, for the entire nation, for the entire world, what Zulfiqar bhai has done is marvellous! Today, the National Press is looking up to Bengal. They're looking up to us! How, a man can singlehandedly.. Finished those terrorists, who were the enemies of both.. This country and the world! He alone is the police force! He is one-man army! He is our very beloved, our very own.. Zulfiqar Ahmed! Long live Zulfiqar!- - Long live Zulfiqar! Long live Zulfiqar!- - Long live Zulfiqar! Long live Zulfiqar!- - Long live Zulfiqar! What happened, Basheer bhai? Sitting here alone? Didn't you go? No space for you on the stage? Just come to the point! You've been trying to say something for days. The stage will have room for only one, Basheer bhai. So it's time to bring the stage down. Huh? You already know the rules of this jungle. We are wild dogs. We hunt together. But if someone gets bigger than the pack, he needs to go, right? What nonsense!- - Nothing new, Basheer bhai. Your own words. Whoever breaks the rule of business is a traitor. Father, son, brother, friend, whoever be it. True but Zulfi never went against the Syndicate, Kashinath. Zulfiqar didn't have this power ever! Every kid knows his name! Political parties want him, businessmen line up for him! People from my area worship him, fear him! Control, Basheer bhai, control... power! It can corrupt anyone. Before the Syndicate he was ruling this area with Parvez. His hands didn't faulter even once when killing him! You think he will spare the Syndicate and not hog the power alone! - But Zulfi...- - What? What about Zulfi? Haven't you risked your life to save him, so many times! I have seen that! That's you. Would he be able to kill Parvez without me? He'd be dead by now. An ordinary man suddenly becomes God doing nothing And we are to twiddle our thumbs? Hence, our party has decided, to offer the election ticket to Zulfiqar sahib! Long live Zulfiqar!- - Long live Zulfiqar! Long live Zulfiqar!- - Long live Zulfiqar! Zulfiqar bhai...- - It's an honour to get an opportunity like this to serve my people. But... I? Will I be able to?- - Zulfiqar bhai, you probably missed their applause. I didn't. Please don't refuse. But... I know nothing about politics, I can't do this, Sir. Politics is serving people. Your people want to see you on the throne. Please! We can warn him. We can make him understand. We can make him aware! Why are you laughing? What? Did I say anything funny? What should we say? "Zulfi, enough now, give up your wings?" Did I say that? We'll say, "Leave for Haj, we will handle your business?" My brain is not working, Kashinath! I understand that, if the Syndicate has to work, Zulfi has to back off. We'll talk to him! But you know he is a crazy, stubborn guy! I don't know if he will listen to us, but... we can sure make him understand things. We'll definitely try. What is going on, isn't correct. We have to talk to him. We will. This doesn't concern the Syndicate alone, Basheer. Fake passports of the terrorists, incoming & outgoing mails... bank statements... plan... blue prints.. Pravez was not alone, Basheer. There was a mastermind. What do you mean? He spoke very little in that meeting. Thought the decision would be in his favour. I mean Zulfiqar. Mr. Basheer, Zulfiqar Ahmed. Goodbye, Zulfi... See you in hell. That was a close save man! That bugger almost convinced you. Only Zulfiqar can convince Zulfiqar. Get it, brother? There's an important meeting at the...- - Hey, you doing okay? - Police station, you've to be there. What meeting?- - Durga Puja immersion and Eid. Are on the same day. We've to see it happens peacefully. Greetings, Zufi bhai. This is my daughter. May God bless you. A ruckus?- - Yes. Zulfi bhai, Markaz is asking if you're coming to the race tonight. Definitely. You guys have arranged it for me after a long time. Thank you! Thank you!- - Beware of this Eid. Did you say something to me, Sir? Beware of Eid, Zulfiqar. Beware of Eid. - What's up boys! - Greetings! So Kashinath didn't come? I knew it! He has no interest in sports. He has a different game going on behind that frown. I don't trust such people, Markaz! Always hungry. It's been a long time, why not tonight? No way, buddy, this is child's play. Besides, all competition is in vain if Zulfiqar participates. Let's see. Let's see.- - Really? Let's see if it goes in vain or not. Get off kid, come on. Yeah! There's more like it! All right guys, let's get ready here! Let's kick some serious ass here, guys! All right! On your mark! Get! set! Go guys! They say, better safe than sorry. I suggest, let's banish instead of killing. Shishir! Want to get shot like Parvez? If we don't kill him, all of us from the Syndicate have to die. Mark my words. After all, Basheer bhai is with us.- - Yes! And you know him very well. But what about Laltoo, the police? The local councilor's right-hand is with you. Why worry about police? Coward! Fine, fine, but we won't get into trouble, right? Laltoo will gang up with us; the majority. Cop by profession, opportunist by nature. Just worrying about Markaz and Tony. I was saying... what if Basheer bhai comes to know... that we hacked Zulfiqar's account to send those mails? And that we forged those photos and passports? What? Why you laughing? What else? Basheer and Zulfiqar will make Galoti Kebabs out of us. We had to take the risk, Tribhuban. Basheer neither has ambition nor hunger for power. If we didn't play the 'nation' card... would he have ever agreed? Anyway, let's revise the plan. Tribhuban, - - Hmm? - You are to handle Markaz and Tony. Okay. Danish, you are to pick Zulfiqar up on time. Mithilesh...- - Yes? Remember the sequence.- - Okay. Qasim... One more thing. After the job is done, we will let Basheer lead. He will decide everything. Basheer is the second most popular person after Zulfiqar. We've to convince people by all means. Convince that all this is good for them. You all know what an angry mob do to a pick-pocket, right? And we are going to kill Zulfiqar Ahmed! What a race Basheer! Such a tough game! That too with Zulfiqar! Nowadays, you call yourself Zulfiqar so often.. I forget I used to call you Zulfi. People change, Basheer. Times, too. I know. Who knows that better than me! Zulfi! Zulfi! Zulfi! Zulfi! It's ok! Nothing happened. That was just a dream. Just a dream. Happy Eid, Begum. Please don't go, I'm scared! Stay back today. Can't, have an important meeting- - Stay. Don't go please. What happened? What did you dream of? I saw you. Your death. Once heard some lines from Basheer... Cowards die many times before their deaths... The valiant never taste of death but once... Sheikh Peer says, strange is our nature... Death is inevitable But we still fear it Yes, Danish.- - Happy Eid, Zulfiqar bhai. Happy Eid. It's a festive day, let me accompany you. I'm waiting downstairs. Go ahead, I'm coming. Karishma is little...- - Ok! Don't worry. I'll tell them about her attack. You'll be late.- - No, don't say all that. Ok, I'll just tell them that you'll be late. Even if someone asks about her attack, I'll keep mum. Danish, stop it, she's fine. Just wait, I'm coming. Listen, the problem's stretching long. I'm being pressurized. They know, I'm a Syndicate member. Please resolve this now. Disgusting, they drink whole day and create problems. They threatened me and Mithilesh that day. One punch from Markaz will sort them. He's saying it's Eid, won't beat them much. Only break the bloody bugger's hand and let him go. Hope we won't be late for the meeting. No, we have time to finish this. Okay, fine. On this festive day, I appeal to everyone... to give a thought about my brother's case. He's locked-up since long. Be it Eid or Christmas, a drug dealer can't be spared. Zulfiqar bhai, he has been punished enough! Okay, lets hear out the other members. The verdict is passed. Don't drag this. Smuggling drugs won't be tolerated. Zulfiqar, I too think we should consider Mithilesh's...- I'm done with the talking, Basheer. The issue's such. And yes, Mithilesh, you wanted the Syndicate's decision, right? For now, assume I'm the Syndicate. Goodbye, Zulfi. Hail India. You too! No more corpses today. Especially, not a cop. Killing a cop is troublesome. Racked up inside us Are all wounds of time The scarlet colour of this morning Scars everyone God himself shatters our homes The blank gaze keeps staring at an ashen past A grave disease in these tough times An unknown dark fear A grave disease in these tough times An unknown dark fear Racked up inside us Are all wounds of time The watchful eyes Sneak away, behind the window You have awakened the One sleeping within me One cannot but sleep away the pain So I stay awake Hoping to meet you at the horizon Racked up inside us Are all wounds of time The scarlet colour of this morning Scars everyone God himself shatters our homes The blank gaze keeps staring at an ashen past A grave disease in these tough times An unknown dark fear A grave disease in these tough times An unknown dark fear A grave disease in these tough times An unknown dark fear So, it's not safe to stay here. We've no idea who's up to what. But where do we go? A place safer than this bar...- - There's one place. Our farmhouse. Yes, I know! Going out without protection is impossible. I was younger... Just had joined the Force. This Syndicate had not been formed yet. They could've killed me anytime.. If it was not for Zulfiqar Bhai. Don't worry about protection. Tomorrow morning, 6 am. Isn't there a solution without hitches? Killing someone in broad daylight is...- - So what? It'll all be over in three days.. Four phone calls will dig the grave for the files. We've other cards, if not Laltoo. But that Markaz...- - And Tony? Kill Markaz and Tony will die of pain. And Akhtar? Akhtar too is...- Who? Which Akhtar? That singer? Yes. Strums his guitar and woos women. I too, am bothered about Markaz. Can find out the location in 10 minutes, Basheer. Let's surprise them with Masood & Tintin. Kill the young snakes. Or else we'll suffer later. Harishpukur, Manasha Mandir, Diamond Harbour Road, Four Star market, All areas are tense. Any moment the public can go... boom! Riots are likely. We shouldn't do anything that can antagonise the people, right? Deal with that family first. Think about the mob later. People are still confused. They've no idea what happened. How was he murdered.. why.. This is the right time to do the mass brainwash. Don't forget one thing... Zulfiqar has a vast popularity. If Markaz can...- - That's what, Kashinath! If we finish the entire family, the public will take it as our personal enemity. They'll think we were envious. But we need to explain. We did it for our country! We'd to kill Zulfiqar Ahmed for the sake of India. His family has to be there for the last rites. Stop him! Someone stop him! It's a long journey! He won't come back. He's going into the sea. I'm here. Nothing will happen. Nothing will happen.- - You have no idea! My husband has another woman now. I saw her! I just saw her! Creepers all over her body. Squirrels playing on her skin! No. Nothing to worry.- - You know that witch, right? Yes, somewhat. Go to sleep now. That witch won't bother you anymore. Just knew this would happen! Shouldn't have listened to them! Should've been with Uncle all the time. This is why he kept us away. Never let us come and stay here! He knew it all the way. He knew it. He knew it. But he kept saying, "The Syndicate is there, nothing will happen to me." Yes, we can see that! Bloody bunch of snakes! Calling them a snake is an insult to the snake! Bloody "Syndicate"! Hang on, brother. We were all members of the same Syndicate, right? We've risked our lives everyday for your uncle! Hate the sin, Akhtar. Not the Syndicate. Tony bhai is right. This is Kashinath's doing. He wanted to control this area. Yes, he'll control the morgue. It's Basheer. - Hello! - Hello, Laltoo...- - Yes, hello... - Let me come straight to the point. I know all of you are together. You, Karishma, Rani, Tony, Markaz & Akhtar too. I'm asking you all to come back. Come back home. The Syndicate has no problem with you. None will harm you. Mr. Basheer, Tony here.- - Yes, Tony. 'The Syndicate' won't harm us, as in? You speak as if, Markaz, myself, Laltoo, Pavel... We're no Syndicate members... As if Syndicate is your ancestral property, Goddam it! That's what I'm saying, you all have your place here. Why are you staying away? Whatever happened had nothing to do with you! Zulfiqar was closing the Syndicate down. He was betraying the nation. That's why this happened to him. Hello? Hang on, Basheer. Markaz is saying something. Basheer, Markaz says, he believes and he understands... that you don't have any personal interest in this matter. You & Zulfiqar were family...- - What are you saying! But my question is about the rest, as in...- No one will touch you, Basheer Khan promises! Please come. You don't have to trust me. Come with the full Police Force. But come. It's his funeral. Won't be complete without you. Basheer uncle, Akhtar here. Just a quick query. You really think you can wash his blood off your hands... by organizing the funeral? Akhtar! Akhtar, enough. Enough. Your anger is natural. When I pointed my gun at him, my hand went numb too. But tomorrow, I'll pray for my friend, Zulfi. Not any terrorist called Zulfiqar Ahmed! Everyone must come. You don't have trust me. Get security...- - We'll be there. Let us know the time. - Thanks! - Tony Bhai! - Shh.. Don't get excited guys. Calm down guys! Calm down. Nothing has happened. Sit down. Pavel, sit down!- - Let's hear Tony out... What's going on here! What's wrong with the people here? Can't we just keep calm? You know what Akhtar, the man, Zulfiqar meant as much to me as to you. Will you shake hands with those murderers? Oh nephew! Even boxers shake hands before the match. But in the end, only one hand is held up. There's a lot of rumors in the air. So, it's important to speak to you. Your Zulfiqar, my Zulfi, wasn't killed in a gang war. Neither was he killed in a police encounter. The Syndicate that looks after this area, employs the youth in 4 Star & Nancy markets saving them from the path of crime, the Syndicate that looked after all these clubs, charity, the same Syndicate, the same Syndicate punished Zulfiqar. Why? Because he tried to destroy the Syndicate and take over everything, he tried to spread terror in the Nation with the terrorists. You tell me? Aren't rules the same for everyone? The deeds that may kill us.. He would survive, just because he is Zulfiqar? Would the rules be different for him? Death for traitors! Basheer Khan, long live!- - Basheer Khan, long live! Death for traitors! Death for traitors! Zulfiqar was a great man! He did phenomenal things. But was also a big threat to the Syndicate, this area, this nation! And his family is aware of all this. See, they're present here. But today, we have not... gathered here for a terrorist. We all are here for that Zulfi, who was a brother, an uncle, a husband, a friend. He was a very close friend. May God... His family and friends are here to say something. Before leaving I'm sharing some lines of Sheikh Peer. If someone is present here Who would die for him If someone is present here Who would die for him Then I must say, he was No less a friend of mine If the question arises... If the question arises, Why I went against him If the question arises, Why I went against him The answer would be I've loved my nation more Basheer Khan, long live! Basheer Khan, long live! Syndicate, long live! Basheer Khan, long live! Basheer Khan, long live! Basheer Khan, long live! Go. Calm down! Calm down! Hello and greetings to everyone present here. Like Basheer bhai said, we have come here today, for Zulfiqar bhai. But not to speak about his memories, No memories & all that jazz! We've come for the last prayer, for his funeral. Basheer bhai who's never wrong, said that we are allowed to speak here. Thank you Basheer bhai, thank you very much! Thank you! Zulfiqar Ahmed... was an elder brother to us. Day after day, he took bullets for us! Risking his own life for us. What he did for the developement of this area... no one could do that in last fifty years man! But, but.. but.. Yes... correct. We got to know new things about him today.. That Zulfi bhai wanted to take over the entire Syndicate That's what Basheer bhai told us, yes! And friends, as you know, Basheer bhai is never wrong. Isn't it? Friends, when Syndicate's fund dropped, Zulfi bhai used to donateto the poor. From medicines to liquor, from blankets to weddings, anything & everything. He used to donate blood in every blood donation camp. He used to take care of every family personally. Do you know friends, Zulfiqar Ahmed donated half his property to an NGO? Which works for the developement of the slum dwellers... and sex workers' children in this area. Today, we have come to know that Zulfiqar Ahmed is dead. Oh! no no.. Sorry, sorry! Zulfiqar Ahmed has been murdered. By his friends. Why? Ask why... Why? Why? Because, as Basheer bhai told us, Zulfiqar Ahmed was a selfish man! And friends as you know, Basheer bhai is never wrong! The tide is turing, Basheer. Stop him. Too late. People will erupt if we try to stop him now. Kill him right here.- - Have you gone crazy, huh? Just disperse silently. You know friends, Zulfiqar Ahmed was... the natural leader of the Syndicate. Yes. By his bravery & skills. Yes, he was a leader. But he never imposed decisions in meetings. Always went with the collective decision. Probably you remember... right at this spot, just a few days back, he rejected the proposal of that MLA... to run for elections, remember? Not once. Thrice. Three times! Thrice! But Basheer bhai said he was hungry for power! And you know, obviously, Basheer bhai is never wrong. The hands that learnt to hold the pistol from him, went up against him that day. The brave back that protected everybody, that same back was stabbed by all those people! And Basheer bhai who's never wrong, says that, Zulfiqar was the traitor & not the others. Parvez wanted shelter for the 3 terrorists. Then what happened? The terrorists entered without the Syndicate's permission! Zulfiqar went there, found them out & killed them. But Basheer bhai says that Zulfiqar was a terrorist, an anti-national, A traitor, a conspirer! And Basheer bhai is never wrong! You are right Tony bhai! We are not good orators like Basheer bhai. If we were, you wouldn't wait here. You would be rioting! The people who murdererd Zulfiqar Ahmed, those who murdererd his trust, You would've killed them! Avenged him! But no, wait! This would happen if Basheer bhai had said all these! Not us. Because Basheer bhai is never wrong! Party time! Find the scumbag! Kill him! Danish! Let's go from here! Let's go! Yes, coming. Wait! Leave me please! I don't live here!- - Hey! Get up! Believe me, I did nothing. Crying now eh? Didn't think twice before peppering Zulfqar with bullets! He is my twin, I did nothing!- - What! Twins eh? Kaushik never said he had a twin! He was scared...- - Your Dad has a photocopy machine? Kill that bastard! Shoot him! You stay here. Don't go anywhere. Hey! Where are you going, you buffoon! Hey! Get him! Stop! You bastard! You wanted some help, right brother? Hadn't you called us for help? Let's help you now!- - They tricked me! - Now we can help you, come! - Tony bhai, I've kids! Woo! Markaz bhai! Mr. Gupta is getting all sentimental, this bugger! There you go! Please! Markaz bhai, Please! Come on, go that side. And don't make noise! Do not miss, search every goddamn room here! Go that side. Hey! No, no, don't... Bhai, they are not over there! Arreh! Bhai, bhai, don't! Hey, what's all this! Bhai! Spare me bhai, I didn't do anything! Hey! Markaz, please- - Mr. Shishir Tili, change of business? I tried to stop them, believe me! Ask Laltoo if you don't believe me! Bhai, leave me! Becoming a whore wasn't such a good idea, was it? Nothing to watch here, carry on with what you're doing. Move! Tony bhai! Markaz bhai, please! Wait my brother, let's talk here, right? Let's enjoy a little, have a chat. I wasn't with them! What's the hurry? You're always in a rush, man! What's the problem! No, no... question doesn't arise. This is my prey, my kill. My prey, my kill, I told you, right? My prey... - Yes! Laltoo, tell me. Leave it man, how long will they hide! All the rats have to come out of their holes someday! Who's there?- - Kashinath! Any news of Kaushik?- - No, absconding since his brother was killed. And Shishir and Tribhuban's families? Yes, I have shifted them. Basheer, your wife? Basheer...- She's killed herself. I spoke to quite a few people. Can't be on a run anymore. Can change line of business... But respect? Peace of mind? It would be great if Laltoo was with us. There are more powerful guys than him. Can't we do something, Qasim? I'll try one last time. My boss is no longer with me you see. You see politics is made of turncoats. A few deaths will turn them again, right, Basheer? I also think so. It's time to mobilise people. There is a lull. It's the correct time. It would be of help if one man were with us... Who? Saqlain Maqsood. Son of Parvez Maqsood. He's back. When was he gone? He was looking to take control of the River after his father died. Get it, Akhtar? He is the new boss of all pirates and smugglers. Police and coast guards are shit scared! Why, has the Syndicate lost contr- We've to be more careful because things are quiet. Untill we kill each of those scumbags. We need Saqlain Maqsood with us to get the full control. Chheno, fix the meeting. I, Laltoo, Tony &... where is he? Absent today as well? No, he couldn't make it, bro. You know how it is. Even bloody I don't feature in this matter. Nor does my opinion.- - But we're not here to play games. Disorganized crime swamps the area, Laltoo can't manage this anarchy alone... Besides, my uncle's murderers are roaming freely, Does he have no responsibility? Such a short memory? Akhtar bhai, I think it isn't Markaz's fault. That woman casts a spell. I have seen them together. The more the love, the more the addiction! 'Addiction', indeed. The man who was crying helplessly at the funeral, forgets guns, business, revenge... everything! You were better off in that land Why come here to drench yourself? I'm drowning and floating in this sea The swim is unending You were better off in that land Why come here to drench yourself? I'm drowning and floating in this sea The swim is unending This pretence to stay away Riding on complaints and regrets The wind of laughter caresses my body Fills up my eyes, like yours I keep lathering my walls with paint Hoping that you will visit me Let my time Spread across your clock The lines of my fortune That you have written And then again A tic tac toe of mistakes made I too have called out to you In the end By the nicknames I've given you By mistake Meet my eyes, slowly Like a tram I stumble upon it yet again Before I let it fly You come through my window With your night long conversations When the tired ships are gone You can talk about me I have burnt my hands In the fire of your simple heart Let my time Spread across your clock The lines of my fortune That you have written And then again A tic tac toe of mistakes made I too have called out to you In the end By the nicknames I've given you By mistake The lines of my fortune That you have written And then again A tic tac tow of mistakes made I too have called out to you In the end By the nicknames I've given you By mistake Akhtar will have to share the revenue from here. Then we head straight to the South, okay, Markaz? Far away from this dirty business. We'll invest in small properties & mutual funds. A new project is coming up on the Bypass road. Fifty storeys. And a swimming pool on the terrace! Almost like swimming in the clouds. Get it, Romeo? God knows its rate per square feet... chuck it. We're good with the Jodhpur Park or Golf Gardens locality. The initial two or three years, we'll only travel. And yes, telling you beforehand, I want wallpapers & a wading pool. I have selected a chandelier for the living room but... oh yes, a bathtub is very important, okay? Of course we'll fight over bags and shoes, can't help. Want to open a restaurant, Markaz. And for the capital... My mole says they're silently ganging up. They may attack anytime. There's still time, I'm telling you. Let's finalise a settlement with Saqlain Maqsood. Settlement is only for equals, Pavel. And we'll be equals only when Markaz bhai gets out of bed and joins us. As the saying goes, if a dead elephant costs a lac, a toothless tiger would be at least five? What say, Tony bhai? Your sister is right, brother-in-law. You have changed too fast & too much! Pricing friends, huh? Not bad. See Tony bhai, you're a good man. But people say you've milked the Syndicate fund for years. That's a damn lie, how dare you say that!- - Let me complete. No one would be happier than me if this were a damn lie. Point is, I am just looking at one thing right now. Revenge. 'Zulfiqar'... know what the word means? The Prophet's sword was called 'Zulfiqar'. And that sword slicing apart each of those dogs, is all I can see. No friends, family, acquaintances, none! Wo! Nephew, let me tell you something.. You're still new in this area so you don't...- - See you. I'll try & get Markaz to the meeting but can't promise anything. Actually neither can I... regarding anything. Chheno, stay here, need to get a few things. I've observed you. You carry the true legacy of Zulfi bhai. The same brilliance, the same bravery, the same kind of ambitions. Wasn't this ambitious. But one embezzles money and the other is busy with a woman. Forget about revenge, they've forgotten the business too. I just need them to convince Saqlain and kill Basheer. Otherwise... they're of no use in the long run. But after those dogs are hunted down, Markaz bhai will surely come to you. For his share. And not for himself. You know very well, for whom. God! I just know that women! She was married before Mr. Tamal too, in Kalighat. The man was poor, couldn't handle her. Then she married her distant relative, Mr. Tamal. She got his property. Later discovered Mr. Tamal was a big time gambler. She lost both, the property and Mr. Tamal. Then she came to Zulfi bhai. Think about it, Zulfi bhai's grave is still fresh. Look at her, romancing Markaz shamelessly! I'm telling you... this girl... can make her men do anything for money, power and security. She can change her choice of men too. Didn't get you...- - Why... killing two birds with the same stone. So, how are you doing, dear Basheer? All good? Don't be scared. I'll be gone now. But I'll come back again once. Listen to me Zulfi, I had no other way out. I didn't have a choice!- - I know. I know. I know everything now. You'll get to know everything too. And when you do so... that's when I'll come back again. Once again. Get to know what? What is left for me to know? What will I get to know? What will I come to know? What? What do you want to say, huh? What? I've no idea what you're saying. Stay alert. Greetings, Saqlain bhai, come.- - Greetings. So... where are the others?- - Yes, Markaz and Pavel. They'll be here soon, they're on their way. Are they? There. Welcome Markaz! We were wating for you. You have disappeared and how! So... done with your reunion? Tell me, how do I help my father's murderers...- - Hang on, Saqlain bhai. Don't trust the hearsay. The Syndicate did reject your father's proposal. But only Basheer and Kashinath murdered him. Along with Zulfiqar...- - That's wrong! Uncle killed only those terrorists. Really. Were you there?- - As if you were there? Guys, relax! I was there. Markaz too. We were there. Yes. Anyway. Let's discuss the deal. You know about Markaz? He is the best fighter of this area. Police is with us and public hasn't forgiven Basheer and Kashinath. Finish them & join us. You'll profit. I don't want to listen to all this. Along with Basheer & Kashinath, Zulfiqar's name is involved in my father's murder too. So I won't take sides actively. Get it?- - Fine. You don't have to. You can cooperate with us.. Make sure those swines don't escape through waterways. And in exchange I'll help your stuff pass the Customs. Okay? Don't you move, you ass! Stop! Grab him. Grab that jerk!- - Kill him! Get him! Hey! You bastard! Stop, you bugger! Get out of the way! Come fast, they have attacked Pavel, come on! Saqlain! Stay alert! They mustn't escape via the River. Given my word, shared food. Have faith. In a hurry? Made a mistake getting out of the rat hole, Kashi bhai! News is out! Your days are numbered. Forget me. What about you? Lazy Sunday afternoon. What's your choice? A leg piece? Or the ribs? Or do you want the liver? What? No, Basheer bhai! Please! Come on! Move! Stay down you bugger! Shoot that bugger! Bloody bastard! Danish, run! Move! Faster, faster! Crap! Reverse the car! You were the first to shoot, right? Don't, Markaz. Shoot him! Shoot him! Tony, we've worked together, please! Don't kill me, Tony! No, no, no... don't! Tony bhai!- - Tony! Tony! Danish! Danish! Stop firing! You could've told me, right? Yes, right. What would I've told you? That I've framed your dear friend as a terrorist... with the help of fake evidence? That we provoked you against him, so that you join us? Brother, do I have the word, 'Idiot' witten on my forehead? I don't know what's written on your forehead, Kashinath. Because like your fate, your forehead is doomed. Do you know what Danish told me? He told me that you are the illegitimate brother of Pariza. But, now... a new question arises. Why did you do this to Zulfiqar? Huh? Basheer, do you know the name of India's deputy prime minister? What! Our Vice-president's name? Or the second guys who stepped on the Moon or climbed the Everest? Deputy, vice, second position, silver medals... no one remembers these, Basheer. If you've to reach the top...- 'News for the deaf and dumb.' Excuse me! Where's Rani? She's upstairs. They say they've been waiting since Uncle's time to take over the bar. His shoulders and eyes, you've inherited both. The Syndicate has been disbanded now. Basheer & Kashinath are finished too. You see, now people come to me for help Otherwise they go to Laltoo. Markaz & Tony are hardly...- - Did you eat anything since morning? Want something to eat? The same ambitions. Otherwise, the foreign-returned guitar player, our Mr. Akhtar... and here you are...- - They've money, Rani. They are important, I can't say no to them. I'll have to listen to them. Can't refuse! I have nothing except this Blue Nile Bar. 'We', have nothing, except this. I had no way out. I did it for us. We couldn't have lived on the road. Nor in that small room of yours. A luxury yesterday is a need today. Everyone buys the future, Markaz. Please! Please! I'm doing good these days The nights look dazzling without you I'm doing good these days I'm doing good these days The nights look dazzling without you I'm doing good these days My feet don't get numb To cross the road anymore The numerous Norwesters Don't hit me anymore Listen, there's nothing called habit in this world To change is to stay alive And I'll live for another 100 years Know this Even if the streets become empty I'm doing good these days The nights look dazzling without you I'm doing good Anyway, take rest. We must go now. Enough talking. What rest are you talking about, man? I've to get back to work. How'll you run the show alone? So much of accounting and financial disputes...- I'll take care of the show. Just don't worry. You take rest. Oh! That's very sweet of you, I'll tell you that. Let's go. We were just leaving.- - Bye, Laltoo Das. Oh hello!- - Hello. I haven't seen you around, Sister. New? What's your name?- - Niyati. (Destiny) Niyati Dey. I have resolved Chheno's matter.- - Good, he wasn't reliable at all. Hmm. That means, it's just you, I & Tony now. I've employed a young boy for the accounts. He'll stay in my control. And Tony? Good, the Syndicate's gone. Too many cooks spoil the broth. Besides, Democracy doesn't work everywhere, Laltoo. In that case, 'Democracy' becomes 'Democrazy'. That means, now I'm the legal one and you, the 'un-legal' one. Unless you get transferred like in Hindi films. You're a witness to so much after all.- - As in? Just kidding. Sir, the car has arrived. Tell him I'm coming. So long, Arghya. You now know all the people & the incidents. Now, handle it yourself. And yes, remember one thing. Grass, grasshopper, rat, snake, hawk, human... Food chain. Bye. I'll leave now. Watch your paunch! Oh saviour! God, the saviour! Oh saviour! God, the saviour! A saint sings From an old Mosque Oh saviour! God, the saviour!
