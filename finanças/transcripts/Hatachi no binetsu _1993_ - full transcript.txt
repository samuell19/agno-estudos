THE 6TH PFF SCHOLARSHIP FILM A TOUCH OF FEVER Hey Your name's Toru, right? How old? I'm 19 College student? Yes. I presume you have a girlfriend? Most have slept with women. But you seem good at this, too. In fact, good with men, too? Man or woman... doesn't matter. I can have sex without love. Is that so? Personally, I prefer a boy like you. Do you have change? Yes. Well, I'll be going. I'll request for you again. Your name's...? Your name again? Hi, Tatsuru. Where's your boyfriend? He seems to be busy with his employment. He's not here today. Busy with his employment at this time? One company has already accepted him but he wants to aim higher. A real eager beaver. He'll definitely make a good office worker. You'll be busy with that next year, won't you? True. Some start in their junior year. All that seems so unreal to me yet. Imagine me becoming an office worker. I'll get around to it next year. Where's your girlfriend? Why ask now? What was her name? Satomi, right? Here today? No, she isn't. How come? Why isn't she here? No special reason. You two break up? So you did. I'm sorry to hear that. She was pretty cute. Why don't you look for a new one today? This is an ideal place. Yoriko, hello. Where were you? We were looking for you. Beer. Beer. Let's go for some beer. - You'll come, won't you? - To a beer garden? Come with us. It's a great season for beer. What's wrong with you? You're such a bad sport. I have a part-time job. You already have a job? We promised to go look for one together. A great friend you are. What kind of a job? - Manual labor. - Construction work? No... wrestling. Whatever it is, it's not your style. My, my. You've got a hickey here. What're you up to? I detect something fishy going on. Hello, Tatsuru? This is your father. I've tried to call you many times. Where have you been? There's something we need to discuss. I'm usually home in the evening. If I'm not home, talk to Eimiko. All right? So? Are you going to do it? You all have the looks. You'll be quite popular. You look like that actor. He really does. I don't know. Does he? How much can we earn? A million? - Some customers give generous tips. - Maybe I'll try. - For real? - The money's much better. That's true, but... Do we really do it with men? You're not going to be slaves. If you and the customer get to like each other... it's up to you two. But we have sex, don't we? How do gays do it? - Do what? - You use your ass? Then don't. Really? Yes. You do it. No, you do it. Suppose I get piles. Can't stand pain. If you want to work, show me your student I.D. You must also take an HIV test. I forgot mine. Me, too. Besides, I haven't decided to do it. - Came just for the kicks? - Don't mean any harm. Why should I become a faggot? - Is he one of them? - Forget it. Still closed. It's you. You're early. No class? I was free. You should've thrown them out. That's how kids are nowadays. They think life is so easy, that a vending machine would provide them with everything they need. Want to drink? No, thank you. - Where to? - To grab a bite. My God, look at this mess you're making. How can you eat sugar like that all the time? It'll be disastrous if you get more pimples. Make sure you attend all the classes. Funny I should say this, but... I do. I'm a good student. That's good. He quit gymnastics to be a TV personality. He's really muscular. Aren't there a lot of cute athletes recently? What is it? You're still reading that? Why not? Let's apply for it. Even if we applied... And if we do? Won't get any replies. Not unless we apply. It's kind of scary. Never know who may read it. A stranger in some strange town. Hey, try this. It's delicious and far out. No teen idol types in this magazine. - What's this? - You don't like it? - Try this. - Want some? No? It's hazardous to your health. Anything good? Hey...not again. Come on, boys... The bar's opened. Loafing around like this. Get your acts together. Come on. Get up. You, too. You've got crooked teeth and ruddy cheeks. Better work on them... Come on. Get up. Mr. Kawakubo, you're too old to have pimples. That's uncalled for. Hurry up. Yes, sir. Shin, I need to talk to you about something. I'm all by myself today. Decided? Him? Atsushi. He's got a big dick. Sorry, Kosugi. Make yourself at home. Master, some ice, please. Hang on. Master? How come there's water in it? These flowers aren't real. Go take a look in the dorm. Shin. It's nothing serious, but... I want you to do me a favor. Shin, you're interested in modeling? Aren't you, Shin? I brought something nice. Look, a Polaroid. - Let me take your picture? - I'm not photogenic. Don't be a poor sport. It's just for memory's sake. No, thanks. There's nothing to lose. Be a good sport. Please leave me out. Come on. Lift your face. Shin, come on. Look up. Come on...Shin. l don't want to. Then...take a look at these. Aren't they beautiful? How's this? A bit hairy, but... Shin, you have such smooth skin. - Please, don't. - Come on. No, thanks. This isn't really my line, but look at it. This is the list I show my clients. Look. What's this? You've got pimples? Come on. All I need is one picture, Shin. Please look this way. Just one shot. - Don't you have to work? - This is work, too. Expose yourself a bit. Come on, Shin. I'll buy you a present. What? Master wants you to come. It's getting busy. Oh, shit... Why do I...? How is it? Have you saved up some money? Not at all. Oh, no. He's here again. That bald one? A police officer. That's what he says. Has he requested you? Certainly has. You know... You can never tell. He looks so masculine. Machos usually turn out to be queens in the closet. Isn't that... Don't be so cruel. I like him. I'm only cruel to people I like. That's sad. I have a feeling you don't like him. Why? I get that feeling. That's not true. Really? Then it's cruel all the same. What is? He's in love with you. Put you in a spot, didn't I? No, you didn't. That type of attitude leads to discrimination. Tatsuru. Thank you for the errand. Welcome. Oh, sorry. Thanks for getting me out. Second time. I didn't mean anything. That's a brush? I hate his guts. I really can't stand him. Are you referring to Kawakubo? Takes pictures of waiters and others. I don't trust him. He lives with Master, doesn't he? That's what I heard. Master is patient. Be careful with him. I'll be okay. Yes, this is Pinocchio. Yes...there's one available now. A very cute boy, indeed. Yes, I'll send him over. Yes, right away. - Please go over to Hotel Versailles. - In France? Stop joking. You know the place. A quickie, so don't stop at the information counter. Customers by phone are scary. You could get killed. Ones over 20 get left over. Talk about yourself. Here. Where? Let's see... From here...to here. So much? Yes. Good luck. Where are you staying now? At a friend's place. A boy? So it's a boy. Stop imagining things. It's still morning. I know it's none of my business who you go out with. Terrible handwriting. Not too different from yours. Very different. Them again. I really don't need this today. Having a morning date? How nice. Shin, why don't you ask me out next time? Interested in boys now? Wanna be raped? - See you later. - I'm famished. Those assholes. Should've ignored them. Don't play their game. Oh, no. I have a supplementary class. Thank you very much. MARKETING SOCIETY Just a second. Yoriko? That's right. Tatsuru. Hi. It sometimes gets stuck. Bad construction, I guess. - There's a knack to open it. - Is that so? What were you doing? The pictures we took at our last training seminar. There are tons of them. None in there. This one. What? Check this out. It's you sleeping. Hey, who took this? Let's turn it over before the others see it. If there's any you want, put a mark in the open space. We'll print them together. Tell the freshmen about this, too. You shouldn't trouble yourself with this. Want to do it? You won't, will you? Wasn't the dining hall crowded? Brought mine, too. Are you working today? It's a night shift. A waiter? A security guard? Which? A security guard. Must be hard work. It's not bad at all. I can choose whichever shift I like. Tonight, too? Yes. Go for it. Are you a baseball fan? Not exactly. My dad always watches it at home. I became accustomed to watching it. My dad loves it when his 20-year-old daughter drinks with him at home. You're a good daughter. Sort of. I'm still single and... Oh, yeah... - Take a look at this. - What is it? For your boyfriend? No way he'll wear this! It's for my dad. It's terrible. He's going to wear it to play golf tomorrow. I can't believe it. It's not that bad. Are you serious? Gives me the creeps to even think of it. He's got real bad taste. What about your father? He's not much different. Would he wear this? I guess so. I don't know. Does he have bad taste? No, he's average. Really? All dads must be the same. I'm sorry I kept you waiting. I'm so sorry. Ouch! - Are you all right? - A pebble-- Let's see. Done! Let's go to another joint. Your boyfriend will be angry. Forget him. Let's go. Closed? It's still early. Too bad. Shall we go? What's next? What is next? What shall we do? What shall we do? You know... I didn't know you could be so cool about things. Really? I feel relieved. At what? It's better to think before we act. Did you quarrel with your boyfriend? It's nothing like that. Only... Things aren't easy. You're someone's guy or someone's girl... People evaluate you for whoever you go out with. People always refer to people in pairs. As if it's natural to be together all the time. I am myself. True, I like my boyfriend. But why do men always say: ''Let's live together''' or, ''Let's go steady''' ''Let's get married''... or ''You're mine.'' That's all they say. And they always smile after they say it. That doesn't make me happy at all. What am I saying? Well, let's forget it. Shimamori residence. Hello? Hello, Tatsuru? This is your father. You're never home. l need to talk to you. Didn't you talk to your mother? She called me. You two talked about legally separating from the family? Not really. That kind of talk makes me sad. I'm sure your mother hates me and uses you as an excuse to nag at me. l hope you understand. I'm not earning much now. To pay your tuition l borrow from the bank. l feel sorry for Eimiko. She finally got pregnant but had an abortion, considering our finances. Is it my fault? I'm just saying you're the only one to inherit the Shiimaimori name. CLASS CANCELLED Request for withdrawal... Fill in inside the bold lines. And stamp your guardian's seal. Who did you go to Hokkaido with? Well, it was... I thought it was going to work out, but... - What? - Is that all? You have the student I.D., don't you? Please return that. You can mail that form to us. You took a vacation, huh? How is it? Do you mean school? Do you attend classes? Yes, mostly. Recently, young people can live cleverly. I guess... Is yours... Is it big? Oh, I'm pretty sure it's standard. I see... Do you ever play with yourself? Masturbate? Yes, I do. How do you do it? With vertical movements. If you don't mind... would you massage my shoulders a bit? Sure. Thanks. No problem. Stiff? Yes. You have such nice hands. Do you do any sports? Yes. Karaoke, for example. How shall I say it? If someone had a good son like you, he'd be a happy father. I envy him. I have a daughter, you know. Having a daughter is no fun. Is that so? You're really great. If I only had a son like you... I wish I did. Let's do it with our clothes off. Thank you very much. So drunk. Dangerous to take the stairs. Can you make it home by yourself? Thank you. Thank you very much. Please come again. Thank you very much. What are you doing? Not hungry? Too greasy. He quarreled with his parents. - Shut up. - You said so. I did, but... You did? Because everything is so ridiculous. What is? My parents, for example. What did they say? They said they're ashamed because I'm gay. They said they'd rather... have me sniff glue. Did you try? No, but it might be a good idea. I don't go home, but I go to school quite often. Even if you're absent one-third of the year, they can't flunk you so easily. My parents won't complain as long as I go to school. Do you really think so? That's how I feel. You know something? When I went to get my things I ran into my dad, and he started blubbering about college. The entrance exams won't be easy. No sweat. I'm smart. Are you? No. I actually want to study designing. To be a designer? Yes. A designer. Draw pictures and... Design clothes? That's right. It sounds cool. I heard entrance exams at design schools are easy. They are. I have no idea. They really are. But my dad started to say I could never be a designer. And then finally said he wouldn't give me a penny. Money was all he talked about. So I told him I had a job. And if I tried, I could earn my tuition. You know, I make more money than he does. Tough boy, aren't you? I told him I can take care of myself. He asked me about my job, so... You told him? I'm glad I wasn't there. I'm not talking to you. Keep out of my affairs. And? My mom... took out pictures of me when I was a child. Started saying things like, ''Shin used to be so cute.'' Photos I'd never seen. She cried like a baby. My dad was a sight. He got furious. He face turned crimson and he started shaking. ''The Defense Force should reform a weakling like you.'' He kept saying all kinds of nonsense. Life's so simple for him. He's a fool. You know, he's homeless now. He's not staying at the dorm? It's worse than my home. Why not let him stay with you? Keep out. My apartment's very small. What about your place? - I don't allow guests. - No, thanks. Never asked you. If it's only for two or three days. - You're in luck. - What is it to you? - May I take this away? - Yes. This, too, please. I'm not finished. Weird kid. Hello. Your voice is low. I can't hear you. What? Your things? Why me? Where are you anyway? I can't hear you. What's going on? I'm getting rid of them. What a waste. Take anything you like. Isn't this nice? I've always liked it. Does it suit me? It does. But it smells bad. That looks smelly, too. Want to see something? Nothing to do, huh? Well, that's true, but... It's in here. Isn't this Mr. Kawakubo's bag? - So what? - Did you steal it? If he finds out, he'll cry. He definitely will. It's dangerous. Did you steal it? - I was bored. - So you stole his bag? I'll return it. - Leave me out. - Don't worry. A camera. Take my picture. He'll love this. - Yes, like this. - Oh, yes. Take your clothes off. - The real fun comes later. - The very last. Akira, please. Just me, stripping. - Here goes. - That's really good. Lay off. Like this? Together or alone? - More fun this way. - Like that? - Okay? - Stripping? This way. One more. Alone. Go on. What are you excited about? Now, what's next? He should love them. They're not ready yet. - Put them in. - Let me. Wow, take a look at these. Did Kawakubo seduce all of them? I wonder... Maybe. I hear he pays you. For love nor money... He's so ugly. He sure is. Hurts my pride. We have our pride. We won't sleep for peanuts. Not all of them. - Maybe not. - Kawakubo is no angel. Him, maybe. It's like a tiger's den. If you're in, that's it. - I've heard such stories. - It's no secret. Tatsuru, how long are you going to continue that job? Don't know. But I enjoy it, when I get paid. I've made up my mind to do it only with people I like. Are you quitting? You need the money. It'll work out. I've already bought a sewing machine. It's got an IC inside. It can do embroidery and other stuff. I want to do everything... All of them properly. Soon... I'll make real cool haute couture dresses. Flashy ones? I want to... I want to prove that I can be someone... that I'm worth something. I often think about becoming something unreal. What do you mean ''unreal''? Not of this world. There's no such thing. It's really been a while since I got to talk to someone. It is. Can't wait till tomorrow. - One, two, three, four. - Yes. One, two, three, four. One...two...three...four. - Your uniform? - I forgot it. I could mark you absent. Now, once more. One... I see. So that's the guy. You've seen enough of him? Let's go. Introduce him to me. You said ''just for a minute''. You've seen enough. Come on! He'll see us. I'm going. Stingy! Hey...hey...hey. And what happened? - What happened? - About what? What's there to hide? Nothing. Really. How do you call each other? Call what? Each other's name. What's that to you? I'm not telling anyone. Other people's love affairs are just a drag. You should be happy I'm showing interest. There's nothing interesting going on. What, then? We're friends. Seems more than that. Getting a lover... Getting a lover and making a friend. Which is harder? I wonder which is really harder. Getting a lover? I don't know. I thought you'd be happier. It's hard, especially between men. Same with girls. Man-to-man relationships seem simpler. Are you underestimating gay relationships? As if you know it all. For your information, a heterosexual relationship is not any easier. She's making a lot of noise. Doesn't even have a boy. Leave me alone. You're impossible. lt's great lt's great to be human This is boring. I'm going. - Don't be sore. - I'm not. Your mother told me to give this to you. Proof of her love. I didn't tell her where you were. Thanks for getting my things. What? - You know what I'm talking about. - Know what? You jerk. I thought you were my friend. What? Someone saw you the other night. I saw it all. What did you do after you got Yoriko drunk? Oh...that. You crook. You know he's got a crush on her. She has a steady boyfriend. I think she broke up with him. You could be the reason. I certainly am not. I'm not complaining. You two would make a swell couple. I'm all for it. Okay? Don't talk like that. That girl. A university campus looks boring. What fun do you think they have? It's easy to kill time if there's a place to be. I'll become a dumb co-ed, and then get married. Here. How did you recognize me? Been spying on you. I wanted to know what you were like. Just from curiosity. I'm sorry. I see. Well, I must be going. Excuse me. I... You know I'm in love with him? I'm coming in. The cushion. Thank you. Oh, I hope they haven't melted. Want ice cream? I bought these on the way. Are you, by any chance, Tatsuru's... I mean, do you live with him? I'm only here for two or three days. How did you get to know him? We met at work. Are you his girlfriend? No, I'm not. Go ahead and eat it. It's delicious. This is the first time I've come here. Your first time? Did you have an appointment? You came in as if it was your own place. And you even bought ice cream for two. That's true. It might be natural... to think I'm his girlfriend. You're right. What am I doing anyway? Don't you love him? Never thought of it. But he seems to be in love with you. That's his problem. Isn't that unfair? He loves you, and you're living with him. Ignoring his feelings isn't fair. Am I supposed to approach him? But... And I don't know how he loves me. You mean... There are different types of love. Suppose he suddenly embraces me. Then I'll know what he expects. Although I've never loved a man that way. But... I thought you were gay. You don't decide that. Sleeping or not sleeping with men... in those terms, I am gay. There are those who can only make love to women and still love their male friends. For me... love is of no concern... when sleeping with a customer. Customer? What customer? Then... ''met at work'' means you two work at a... Didn't you know? What's with him? I'm leaving. This is terrific. It's a smart machine. Sews by itself. No, it's your touch. No, it isn't. A man using a sewing machine... It's not rare. - You're really skillful. - Almost done. So soon? It's so quick. Thank you. Sorry I raided your place. Don't worry about it. I'm surprised. You have a roommate. It's only for a while. So I heard. He's a high school boy. You have a variety of friends. Do you think so? I envy boys. They can be friends so easily. It's not always true. Really? I've always envied boys. Boys were always together when I was in high school. They seemed so close to each other. I wondered what that was. Can I come over again? Yes, if you like. Maybe I can join in this time. lt's great lt's great to be human Delicious rice and... Weren't you dating Shin? Did you have a quarrel? So you did have a quarrel. We skipped class to see you. Too bad. Right. Now we know... Hey. You have the weirdest tastes. - What do you see in him? - That faggot! Come to our concert next time? - Come on. - Hot sounds. - It's true. - We're great. Come and see us. Say yes . It's decided. No problem. Turn the sound up. No problem. I've seen this. You shouldn't have rented that. There are so many. It makes no difference. Really? I should have asked for the most boring one. Why get such a tape? If you are going to sleep, sleep on the mattress. Tatsuru... why do you do such work? Why ask? Don't you get disgusted? It's not fun, but I don't dislike it. Really? I don't understand you. I'm not asking you to. Don't you get sad? Why should I? I hate sadness. Everybody does. Then, why? What's the point in understanding me? What's the point if you do? Your own sadness is... very, very personal. Asking others to understand is procrastination. You're just acting cool. If you say so. That's not being honest. All right. I think... it would be best for you to go home. To become a designer, you'd better straighten up. I can't help you out here. I'm not asking you to. Then what? You're funny today. What's wrong? - What is it? - Stop it. What's eating you today? Stop it. What the hell are you doing? I don't love you or anything. There's no need to do this. Tatsuru... Tatsu... What? You have a guest? Hi. I missed the last train. Ota, get up. You're already up? I'm still sleepy. Won't you get it? Yes, this is the Shimamori residence. Hello. Oh, hi, Yoriko. Good morning. It's me, Ota. Yes, good morning. Today? I'm pretty sure he's free, so he should be able to. No need to bother. I'll be all right. I have a meeting. Of course, he can. Tatsuru's a man. He can carry a TV set. Hang on, I'll put him on. I knew you two were up to something. I envy you. Hello. She wants it where it was before. The stairway's narrow. Careful. Turn slowly at the corner. Watch your fingers. Here? Will you clean that up? All right. Wait a minute. Here...here. All right? Heavy, isn't it? Careful. Over there. Don't crush your fingers. Here. I really appreciate it. We can't do this without extra manpower. We have so much junk here. We should get rid of them. This hasn't been used for more than two or three times. Come on, Mom. Enough. Thank you for all that hard work. Have a seat. I must be... Dinner's ready. You must join us. An extra person makes no difference. Hey. Bath. - Dad's saying something. - What is it? Bath ready? Yes, I'm sure it is. Go take a look. Sure. Sit here. What's with him? He's acting strange. He usually hates taking a bath. Please sit down. Nothing elaborate, but... You were a great help. Not a gourmet dinner, but please join us. You must have perspired. Why don't you take a quick bath? - No, thanks. - Don't be so formal. Oh, yes. What was your name again? It's Tatsuru. Tatsuru. Mom, the bath was boiling. Oh, I completely forgot. Let's eat first. All right... Take this. Be careful. - More? - Yes. Okay. Don't leave Tatsuru alone. You can do that later. This can wait. The antenna isn't connected. It is. You said you unhooked it. I didn't. Are you sure you didn't? The cable's there. I told you. You're not used to this. Serve the rice. Big serving? You can eat a lot. Special offer. Dear, it's ready. It's ready to eat. This is yours. I'll do it. Let's eat. Please help yourself. This salad is Mom's special. You love this, don't you? Serve him some. You can do it by yourself, can't you? Go ahead. Oh, no. The rice is too soft. - Really? Think so? - My fault. - It's not that bad. - I'm sorry about the rice. Did you pour the soy sauce? Here you are. I love watching people eat a lot. That's how boys have to be. It's so nice to have a boy in the house. It's like having a son, isn't it, dear? That's a dishcloth. Pour some for him. All right? Have you decided on your employment? No, not yet. He's still a sophomore. Recently, children work freelance and get by. He doesn't. He's a good student. He does work part-time. I have nothing against working. He attends his classes and works night shifts. He's really a good boy, isn't he, dear? Oh, no. He's perspiring. The fan. You're not drinking? I forgot to tell you Satoru called a while ago. Said he'd come soon to say thanks. Satoru? Yes. He's finally settled, so his brother's very happy. Isn't Satoru pretty good looking? Has bad kidneys. - I didn't know. - The poor man receives artificial dialysis. He said he changed his job recently. His friend invited him to work at his company. But he told me it was a failure. A good friend isn't necessarily a good business partner. He ended up working like a subcontractor so his salary went down drastically. So much? - Too bad. - Yes. The poor thing. Are you okay? Shall I bring some water? You've got goose bumps. Are you cold? Mom, where's the water? I'm getting some ice. Forget the ice. He wants water now. Hurry up. Please. Are you really okay? Shouldn't have served all that rich food. Wasn't there watermelon in the fridge? - Let's serve that. - Thanks. Never mind. It isn't so juicy. Really? The grocer said it was delicious. The inside's okay. I thought so. Yummy. Take this. Try some of this? - The window... - Won't it get hotter? A natural breeze is better. The insects will come in. Close the screen door. Here you are. The table's a bit crowded. Yes, it is crowded. Don't you think it's hot? It's stuffy, too. Really? Want some more water? Please eat more of this, too. We can't keep it because it's raw. I'll get the plate. Pour the soy sauce. Please eat your fill. Yes, eat a lot. Mom, the saury's delicious. Had a bath? You'd be doing me a favor... if you can keep my things again. Why? There's a complication. Remember the Agnes blouse you said you wanted? I'll get you that. How's that in exchange? I don't want such a blouse. Are you still sore? Give me a break. You're acting so funny. What's wrong with you? What do you mean? You're a jerk. Keep your things. How come? Why are you here? Where's that college boy? Oh, him. He was a big mistake. He became such a bore, so I decided to split. Yeah. No, you chickened out. I wasn't serious. No, you weren't and you didn't confess to him. It was a good decision. He's so empty-headed. What are you saying? You met him? Did you talk? Tell me. What did you talk about? What? Forget it. I won't ask you. - Going? - Shut up. Shall I say it? Shut up. You're just running away. From your home, from school and from your love. Carrying a sewing machine. Is this a demonstration? What can you do with this? What can you make? What can you do? You're a hopeless case. People put a good price tag on me. Middle-aged men, for example, like me. A tragic hero act? You told me love between men was serious. How serious is it? Show me. Go back so he can ditch you. If you don't, I can't... Yes, miss. Do you still feel sick? Go to the men's room. It wasn't anything special. Really? Don't worry about it. If you're sick, just say so. Sorry for giving you the trouble. Don't think about it. My mom's always like that. Forget it. I... really fouled up today. But I'm all right now. Funny boy. You're strange today. What's the matter? I love you, Tatsuru. But I don't know in what way. I'm not so sure yet whether as a lover or a friend. Or as something else. I don't know how to say it. But I think it's a good feeling. The feeling I have... or the relationship I want with you is not to be lovers. How shall I say it? I can't express it well. I'll go buy something. Tatsuru. A customer at the hotel needs a replacement for our boy we sent. Can you take his place? Haven't you seen my bag? The big black one. From Pinocchio? Let's be friends. Do you know each other? He's so rigid. We can't do anything. He isn't really my type. He's cute, so I thought... Shall we sing? Don't you want to do it? I do. But there's no hurry. I don't like to rush in. Wow. You're not drinking. There's food... Not this. I'm not used to places like this. It's like an aquarium. Are you a college student? Going? You don't need me. Let's drink, the three of us. Sit over here. Over there. Do you want this? I ate this part, so this part's clean. No, thanks. Not hungry? Why are you so rigid? Relax. Relax. It's all right. Take a deep breath. Relax. He's been rigid since he got here. I couldn't handle it, so I called. Take your clothes off. It's a bit hot. - I took them off. - What? I took them off. Stand up. Turn around. Please turn around. Why don't you two do it? Since you're both here, show me. This isn't fun like other times. What's wrong? What is it? Nothing to be shy about. Just let me see it, just a little. Come on. You're cute. Come on. Show me. You're so rigid. Hey. What is this? You're green. Let's cut out this shit? You really bore me. This is boring sex. Are you already finished? What? What is it? What's going on? What? What's wrong? You don't even have a hard-on. Let's make them big. It's no fun, if they're small. Boys are supposed to make them big. Boring. Why? Aren't you professionals? You get paid for doing this. Is this a joke? What is this? What? You shits! You're not professional at all. You're only here to earn easy money. Hey, you. I mean you, college boy. High school boy. What is this? So you're angry. Are you gay? Are you? I'm gay, if that interests you. What's funny? What's so funny? What's funny? Say it! What's wrong with you boys? Say it. You shits. You wouldn't know... the pain of being unable to speak out... what you really feel? I do. No. A college boy... I was in love with a boy like you. You resemble him. Really friendly to everybody. That's what you call a cruel humanitarian. That's him. I was desperately in love with him. But it didn't work out. I fouled up. I told him how I felt and things like that. He said he didn't mind, although he wasn't gay. But... It's my personality. I couldn't believe he truthfully meant what he said. I thought he lied to me. It could have worked out, but I fouled up. Since then, sex became my life. With men, with women... Not much difference whether it's a man or a woman. That's how I feel. But... a man-to-man relationship is sad. Hey. Do you like me? No? Don't. Please don't. Please don't dislike me. What's the matter? What is it? Do you want me? What? Smart ass. How dare you! None of you assholes... really know anything. Your friendly act. Crying won't help you. I wish I could cry, too. I'm here because I'm lonely. Why must I be treated like this? A bear cub watches hide-and-seek The child showing his seat wins first place The sun is setting so we'll meet again tomorrow See you tomorrow lt's great lt's great Ridiculous. lt's great to be human They get to eat delicious hot meals Parents are waiting for their children to return I'm going home, too I'm going home Turn around, turn around and bye, bye, bye lt's great lt's great I found your picture. I didn't do it. Really? Then why did he take that picture? He was so persistent. I felt sorry for him. Did you get paid? That's really dumb. You should sell yourself higher. I'll remember that.
