What the hell is that? What's going on? Port side engine's on fire. Go back to your seat. Controls aren't responding. Brace for impact! At 0130, a C-47, alongside its 10-man crew, disappeared 80 miles south of Stuttgart. So... We've been tasked with checking it out. - Hey, get the gear. - Move out. Go, go, go, go, go. Korsky, Hoyte, Gardner, Castle, move. Get to work. Simms, rear! Hey, we found some clips of Swedish... Everyone else, keep your goddamn ears open. Vehicle, six o'clock! Easy, Sergeant. Fuck. Son of a fucking... Major Johnson. What a surprise. I was told you were running operations from a chateau outside of Reims, sir. Yeah, well, I guess I got a little tired of eating frog legs and foie gras. Well, I just hope you didn't make the drive in vain, sir. Hey, come on. You know, Sergeant, a conductor needs to just come to the orchestra pit for some time. You know, from time to time, brother. Mm. Yeah, but this ain't no opera, and these ain't no violins. They just happen to make sweet music of their own. Come on, you think you could pick it up a little? Well, I think it's time I introduce you to someone. Walsh is an old pupil of mine from back in Texas. He's also quite literally the only man for the job. I got 12 men already, and you know 13 ain't a lucky number. You know that plane went down behind enemy lines, and it was carrying sensitive material. And Walsh is going to be riding with you to retrieve it. My team doesn't need outside help recovering cargo, sir. Disobeying orders. That's a court martial offense. Yeah, but if I'm in jail, who's gonna do your dirty work, huh? It's nice to see you haven't changed. It's great catching up, Sergeant. It's always such a pleasure to see you. Well, but as you know, time is of the essence. Watch your step. Come here. Don't just stand around, we got work, man. You ever whacked any Jerries? Depends on your definition of whacked, sir. Christ, just keeps getting better and better. All right, listen up, boys. We're gonna find that wreckage and we're gonna patch up who we can, and we're gonna let this guy sift through the rest. Let's move out! Keep moving, come on, hey. You know, when we were at Marseilles, I pulled Brewer from a burning APC. Two of his men were still trapped inside. Bastards, they were screaming, and before I could get to them, a Stuka swooped down out of nowhere, and well, what can I say, there was nothing left but a crater where they'd been. Brewer still despises me for it. He'd rather die a thousand deaths himself than lose a single damn soldier. That's the kind of man he is. And I'll tell you what, I sure wish we had more like him. All right, all right, waterproof your gear, we're taking the scenic route. Yes, Sarge. All right, wait, fuck, just wait. Come on, get those tubs and a whetstone. Walsh, tell me. What makes this sensitive material so special they need a, an entire squad dedicated to it? I don't ask about what they send me to retrieve. - And why is that? - Keep moving, come on. Well, if I'm captured, that way it's impossible for them to get anything out of me, no matter how much they torture me. Come on, hurry up. This just arrived from command, sir. Let's have some coffee first, huh? Sir, yes sir. - Quit moving around! - Flatten it out! We'll search this quad first. Make our way to high ground. All right. Then scan from there. I wanna find this crash site before nightfall. Come on, let's move out. Oh, shit. Well, you certainly know you're back in the thick of things when the lukewarm dirt passes for coffee. Listen, this operation's been designated top secret. Anything you hear or see from this point forward is not to leave this tent. You get my drift? Yes, sir. Understood, sir. I'm curious, though. You have some of the best surveyors in the world at your disposal. Why bring me in? Well, I hear your German is impeccable. My PhD thesis was on dialect diversity of ancient Germanic tribes. Well then, let's put it to the test, shall we? I want you to listen up. Our codebreaker's been analyzing a transmission recorded by OSS. Okay. Right here, what are they saying? Just a bunch of random numbers, sir. No, no, no, no. The voice in the background, the woman. I will play it at a half speed. Sounds like... Sounds like Baum des Lebens. Baum des Lebens, what does that mean? Tree of life. Tree of life. Sarge. Sarge, can I wipe my ass with this when we run out of toilet paper? Did our guys do it? No way. SAS, maybe. The Brits wouldn't do this, or the French, and the Russians ain't this far west. Luger, nine millimeter. Krauts did this to their own? I bet these men were deserters. You know what I say? The Krauts start killing Krauts, sit back and enjoy the fireworks. Taft. Let the Jerry rot in peace. Take cover! Don't worry, it's okay to piss yourself the first time! Korsky! Go. Thoretti! Cover fire! - Go, get in there. - Go! Clear! Gardner. Ask him how many are still out there. Hey, easy, man, easy. Can I look? Come on, boy, speak English. Shell shock due to severe trauma. I've seen this before. Beat him all you want, he ain't saying a word. Yeah, he shoots well for severe trauma. Get him up, he's coming with us. Sergeant? What's the problem, Walsh? Forget to get shot? I hope you get over your trauma soon, you limey son of a bitch. Sure it's wise to take him with us? I'll find a use for him. He'll give away our position first chance he gets. You just worry about that plane we need to find, huh? You and Rucker check it out. Right there. Yeah, check it out. It's nothing, let's go. Let's go. Holy fucking fruit. Let's go. Let's go! Okay, yeah. Oh shit! Who... who the hell are those women? They're civilians, they hide up here from us. Their husbands are off fighting the war somewhere. I never seen civilians like that before. Not even in France. Oh, you haven't been laid in a long time, Ruck. Maybe you never have. You kidding me? I used to get it all the time back home in Sweden. Yeah, right. - Women? - Absolute knockouts. The redhead, man. She got this gorgeous body with two perfectly round... At ease, Rucker. But sorry, Chief, them girls might know where the plane went down. Yeah, he's right, Sarge. Me and Simms here, we can use our interrogation skills from Paris, you know? My zook's loaded and ready to fire, man. We got a man down. We're not gonna risk our position to mess with civvies, got it? - Got it. - Yeah. You got a problem, Walsh? No, sir. Let's move. So I'm thinking about asking Sarge for a one night pass. Dream on, Ruck. Are you telling me you wouldn't wanna ride one of them moaning girls? We got married two days before I shipped. Look at this. She's two already, and I never held her once. I ain't betraying my family for some Nazi whore. Ooh, Nazi whore. I like the sound of that. What the hell? This don't make a shit worth of sense. We've been following that contour for an hour. Now we're in the same spot? There's no way the sun is north. We must be in the middle of some, some kind of magnetic ore. It could be what took down the plane. What? It could be what took down the plane. When Odysseus entered the land of the dead, the demons, they changed the stars so he would lose direction. What kind of fufu gibberish is that, Walsh? It's Greek mythology. Okay, do me a favor. You keep your goddamn poetry to yourself, all right? Somebody's been here after we left. Well, it takes wolves a couple hours to sniff out the grave and start digging up the body. Olin, fire up the radio. We'll use it as a signal to navigate. I need two volunteers to guard the perimeter. Everyone else, 10-minute rest. I'll take the southeast quadrant. Will you now? All right, whatever, Walsh. Carbony, your rifle. Walsh, don't make me regret it. Gotta drop a bomb. Keep right where I can see you. I'd rather get shot than have you watch me taking a shit. Sierra Echo, this is Falcon Seven. - Do you copy, over. - Sarge. Sierra Echo, Major Johnson needs to speak with you, over. Copy, Falcon Seven. It's dead, sir. ♪ Go on, brave Spartan ♪ ♪ You are most welcome ♪ ♪ To stay here for food ♪ ♪ So tired from trouble ♪ ♪ So weary of war ♪ ♪ Give into rest, soldier ♪ ♪ Fight no more ♪ I have no idea what you're saying. Hey, you stay right where you are. Friend? That's our bird. Damn. Now would you believe if I told you I've never done this before? This is Captain Rice. Everyone else is dead. Captain Rice? Captain, can you hear me? Do you copy me? Captain Rice? Captain, can you hear me? Oh no, dear god. First section, let's move! Please help me! Help me. Don't kill me. - Walsh. - Yeah, at ease, G.I. What the hell are you doing? I heard a shot. Why'd you discharge your weapon? I ain't telling you shit. You ain't the sarge. But I am. Walsh put a knife to my throat, sir. Almost killed me. Walsh? Your man, he fired his weapon, he charged the squad. I'm not taking any chances. What were you firing at, Private? I was charged by a wild pig. What were you doing out there anyway? I... I found the plane, sir. Good job, Private. Let's move! I thought you said you didn't have any combat experience. Well, I never said that. I guess maybe you just assumed it? Then how'd you learn to take down a man like that? Burma. Hey, Walsh. I really don't care how many Japs you bushwhacked in the jungle. You do that to one of my men again, you're gonna answer to me. It's just wild boars. Sounded like one of Rucker's potato farts. Remember D-Day, Bo? Yeah, I thought we were gonna die before we hit the beach. Let's move. Friar, north perimeter. Rucker south, rest of you sweep for survivors. Walsh, do what you came here for. Sergeant. There were 11 flyboys on this bird when it crashed. There should be bodies, or parts of them anyway. Krauts must have got in here before we did, took all the bodies away. No, it wasn't the Germans, that's for sure. Oh, I almost forgot. We got an expert in our midst. If the Nazis had been here, sir, they wouldn't have left this. Okay, we found the plane, we found the secret stuff. Can we go home now? We're not going anywhere. If there's a, even the slightest chance that one of these flyboys is still alive, I'm not leaving them behind. Sarge. This way. Ah, Jesus. You okay, man? Yeah, okay. Sarge. Sarge. Simms! Captain Rice. USAF. Morgan. Check him out. He's dead, sir. I said check him out. The Japs got to him. That ain't Japanese, you idiot. Then what is it? Bird, tree, death. Ancient magical symbols. Cut him open. - I'll do it. - Do it. I heard stories about Nazi doctors doing this kind of thing. You know, medical experiments, mutilations, drugs. Had enough of this bullshit. This man, he has no internal organs. In Haiti they use feathers to bring back the dead and shit. It's called hoodoo or something. Stop that crap right now. All right. You fellas wanna know what's going on? We got all the answers right here. Right here. You start talking or you start eating. Hexen. - Hexen. - What does hexen mean? Witches, sir. You fellas are right. Should have shot him right on the spot. I'll do him right now, Sarge, - just say the word. - No, no, it's too late. Too late. Crew's dead. And I ain't going back empty-handed. Put the dead in the ground. We're going home. What do you know? You know, in 1840, Hans Garmin, the German national wanted in connection to dozens of missing children in Leipzig. He was arrested trying to enter the US, and this manuscript was found sewn into the lining of his luggage. It's the first of a two-volume set. You have the second part as well, sir? Well, certainly not for lack of trying. I've led teams across three continents in search of it. Come here, tell me what you make out of it. Right here. Hm. Old High German, definitely. Well, I mean, I could have told you that. But sir, this is the oldest form of the Germanic language, hasn't been spoken this way in 1,000 years. Okay. Defeating time, does that make any sense to you, sir? Well, yeah, more than you could imagine. No wonder that fucking Fuhrer's agents have been scouring the area. I just hope we find it before they do. This ain't playtime, Walsh. You gonna tell me that after everything we've seen, nothing seems strange to you in the slightest? Two years ago, I was in Italy. And we'd been spilling our brains out fighting the Germans right and left. But then, on Christmas Eve, everything got quiet. The Jerries started playing Christmas carols on their loudspeakers. And their boys and our boys joined together. Two days later, we started blowing each other's brains out, just like before. So, no. Nothing seems strange to me anymore. Help dig. Rucker. Rucker, tell me what you saw back there, at the windmill. Come on, man, I know you saw something. Tell me what you saw. Tell me about the women. Oh, Jesus, I think I'm gonna be sick. Easy there, easy, easy. Let me help you. Don't touch me! Rucker? Morgan, help him out. Stay back. Whoa, whoa. Stay back, or I'll shoot myself. What the hell you doing, Ruck? I'm so sorry. Come on. Stay down, stay down. Give him a shot! Stick him! Jesus Christ. I told him to stay away from those French tarts. He didn't go with no French tarts, Gardy. Ruck's never even had a girlfriend. Look like it's eating his flesh. If he can't walk, put him on a stretcher. We gotta hit that river by nightfall. Let's finish up this business, all right? Where is he? - Get that goddamn Jerry! - Shit! You got one chance to quit squirming. Oh God. Who did this? He says they exsanguinated him, like they did to his men. Sergeant, nobody can bleed out a man that fast. Witches can. I want a better explanation. Brewer! I really think you should talk to Rucker. You got something you wanna tell me, Private? More, ow, morphine. It hurts really bad. No. Not till you tell us what you know. I shot one. What the hell you talking about? I fucked one, and then I shot her. You shot a civilian? I, she was, she, she wasn't a civilian. She was a witch, Sarge. The hell did you do to me? Get back. As my chosen one, you will never die. Get the hell away from me. We're never getting out of this forest. They won't let us. All right, all right, all right. Give this fucker his morphine. Make it a triple shot, will you, huh? Bury Friar with the others. I want a defensive position along that ridge, mined with everything we got, okay? In five minutes, I want you to switch over to this frequency. 0321. Copy, over. Walsh, it's Johnson, go ahead, over. I found the film, sir. We were informed that another SS search party is currently in route. But Brewer, his squad is really losing it, sir. This place, it... It plays tricks on the mind. Goddamn lazy surprise sons of bitches. Fuck! I can't take it anymore, I swear to god, I can't take another fucking minute. Rucker's cursed us. Okay, Sarge? No, he's not okay, none of us is okay. Shut your fucking mouth or I will shut it for you. Sarge... Speak to me. Sierra Echo, reading you loud and clear, over. Four KIA, one severely infirmed. Requesting updated extraction point due to casualties, over. Son of a bitch. Poison gas. And Major Johnson's outdone himself this time. Treating us, acting like fucking guinea pigs. Sir, all I heard was static. - Huh? - I didn't hear anything either. What about you, Korsky? Sir, I heard exactly what you heard. Bullshit! This is Sierra Echo, do you copy me, over. The hell you think you're doing? Proving to you that there is no one there. Base come in, this is Sierra Echo, - do you copy me, over. - Put the handset down. See, nothing. Hello, base command, anyone, please, my CO has lost his fucking mind. Whoa, whoa, whoa, - whoa whoa! - Oh Jesus. - You shot me. - Just a graze. Next one won't be. Now sit the fuck down. Private Taft, you do not have permission to leave this space! Anyone else wanna question my authority? Huh? Anyone? What about you, Walsh? You hear the voice on that radio? Oh god, please don't kill me, please. Please. Hey. Your watch. There was only static on that radio, Korsky, and you know it. Sarge got us through four years of this crap without getting us shot. If he wants to hear voices on the radio, then I'll hear them too. Come on! Is that a pig? I got one! What happened? Sarge here, he just got us our first decent meal. Right, Sarge? Sure hope Taft's all right. Ah, he'll be fine. Had a similar incident in Marseilles. He'll be back soon as he gets a whiff of this good old barbecue. Mm, num num. Want me to feed the Kraut too? We all know you got a soft spot for Krauts, ever since your mama fucked one. Don't make me kick your ass, you son of a bitch. I'll feed the goddamn Jerry. All right. Let it be known how Americans treat their prisoners. Yum, yum, yum, yum. You knew. 10 yards! One o'clock, in the trees! Sarge! Sarge? No one respects your authority. Everyone's against you. Walsh is a spy. They joined the enemy. These things, they use strike and retreat tactics. They slink off into the forest the first sign of gunfire, only to come back for the bodies once the coast is clear. They're scavengers. So bullets can hurt them then. Rucker said he shot one of them. Wake his ass up, we need to know everything he does. Rucker, wake up. Rucker. Where is he? They're picking us off one by one. There's nothing we can do about it. Nah, we stay together, all right? We take the fight to them. No more being hunted, it's time we start hunting. No. Sergeant Brewer gave us specific orders. Sergeant Brewer's lost his goddamn mind. When do we start? Right now. Who's with me? Fine. Yeah. Suit up. A solar compass consists of three arcs, latitude, declination of sun and time of day to conduct accurate land surveys, providing one has the current coordinates. So, numbers on that recording, what if they're not so random after all? I've been watching you guys. Wanted to see if you were really gonna leave. Welcome to join us. So you're in charge now, huh? These men, they're your men, Brewer. They care about you. Hey, Sarge. We looked for you. Then we waited. Thought maybe the gas got you. You're a terrible liar, Morgan. That was our medic! Wasn't there from the start. An outsider. He was a good man! He was a traitor! So are you, so are all of you! Sarge, I'm sorry! Hey asshole! Olin! Get back here! Olin? Olin! Come back, Olin! Olin! Olin! Where are you? Olin, come here! Olin! Please, God. I just wanna see her again. Betty? God listens. It's impossible. Do you remember our wedding day? It was the best day of my life. Do you take this woman as your beloved wife for the rest of your natural life? I do. Can't fight this off, go, go, go, go, go! Shit ain't right, man. ♪ Hitler, he's only got one ball ♪ ♪ Goering's got two but very small ♪ ♪ Adolf ♪ Damn. ♪ God bless America ♪ ♪ Land that I love ♪ ♪ Stand beside ♪ ♪ And guide ♪ ♪ Through the night ♪ ♪ From the mountains ♪ ♪ Through the prairies ♪ Gone! - You okay? - Yeah. It's Major Johnson, do you copy? This is Walsh, sir, over. All right, Walsh, use a solar compass. I'll have the coordinates for you. Where are you going, sir? I'm going to get my boots a little dirty. Wait a minute. The windmill. It was right here, we saw it. We saw what they wanted us to see, Freeman. Just a illusion. A projection of the real place. Which is hidden under a concealment spell. Impossible to find unless you have the right angle. The right time. And then... It's gotta be right there. There. Walsh. Walsh! There. There it is. Come on. Freeman, check upstairs. The complete witch's archive. The major was only ever able to get his hands on volume one. The Nazis got part two. Last week one of our operatives in Berlin was able to smuggle out a photographic copy of this. So that's what was on the plane. Uh-huh. Come take a look at this. It's Latin for warrior's blood. Right here it says, "Oh tree of life, quench thy thirst, "'til flowers burst." The witches, they were killing the soldiers to live forever. Immortality. It's real, Freeman. If Hitler gets his hands on this... How do you fight an army you can't even kill? Three days ago, OSS intercepted a transmission sent by those Germans we found in the woods, announcing that they had found the tree for the Fuhrer. That was the real mission, Freeman. You knew what we were up against, and you didn't say a thing? I couldn't jeopardize - the mission. - Most of the squad is dead now because of you. Hey, you need to calm down... Hey, calm down. Freeman, stop. Easy, huh? We good? What the hell is that? Wait. They've been harvesting warriors for centuries. Tree of life. Warrior's blood. This is it, Freeman. The tree of life the Fuhrer's fantasized about for years. Don't touch her. Hey, Rucker, you put down that gun there, buddy, and I promise I'll get us all out of here. Jesus. Only one problem with that, Walsh. I like it here. She'll be back for me soon. Look what she did to you. The tree. It's gonna heal me. They promised me that. No. Rucker, they're lying to you. They're just gonna feed you to the tree like all the others. Walsh, get up. Walsh, tags, look. - Walsh. - Yeah. Prepare the others. You're up first, Freeman. You knew we were never going home. God. Let's do this. Get up, son. I was supposed to meet you at the extraction point. Where are the others? They're all dead. Collect the flowers, let's get out of here. Huh, mustard gas. Killed 120,000 people in World War One, before it was banned. Think it'll still work? Well, I imagine we're gonna find out soon. Major, I'm gonna get you out of here. Torch the bitch, torch it. Just torch it.
