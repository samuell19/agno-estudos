Be Good All Your Life written by screenplay by music by director of photography starring directed by The story is set in Debrecen, in the 1890's I'll take a look at the mail, it just arrived. - Lajos Gyalog, G?bor Losonczy... - Here! - J?zsef Kos?rik! - Here! - Tibor Tajtaujfalusi! - Here! No more, you may go. - No letter for me? - What's your name? - Mih?ly Nyilas, Il/b. - No letter. Mih?ly Nyilas! You've got a parcel. Come. Sign here. Are you glad? 5.10. Good morning. Listen! This is only two! It's 5.10 even if you are glad. That's it. Let's pray. Come, dear Jesus, be our guest bless the food you gave to us. Amen. Gee! Nyilas has got a parcel! What's that? A parcel. Nyilas has a parcel! Nyilas' bowl! Where've you been? I've got a parcel. You call this a parcel?! Watch the parcel I'll get, a whole goose will be in it. Look! Nyilas has got a parcel! Then I'll throw this wretched millet-pap behind my back! It tastes good. It's musty and mouldy. It's not musty, just a little mouldy. How much can it weigh? About 7 pounds. My parcel will weigh 10 pounds at least. There'll be a whole roast goose in it. Won' t you open it? First I must go to read to Mr. P?salaki. A masochist, he doesn't even look what's in his parcel. Don't touch it! It belongs to Misi! There are sausages in it! And crackling cones, too. Silence! Go on studying! - Won't you buy a lottery ticket? - I 'm not lucky enough. It's worth buying from me. Last week I paid a great sum to a man... No, to a woman... No, I don't remember now. - Hello. - Hello, what do you want little boy? A lottery ticket? No, thank you. In the shop window there's a Csokonai book. It costs 60 krajcars. I set my eyes on it long ago. Don't sell it, if possible. - Hurry and save up the money soon, my boy. - Good bye. - Good afternoon. - What is it? Do you smoke cigars? Good afternoon. - Two Virginias. - Here you are. I mean, one. A lottery ticket? Poor thing your wing's broken! You shouldn't be afraid of me, what are you doing here? Bless your soul! Who is that? - Good evening. - Good evening. Debrecen' s future. Now as our city makes great advances on the road of progress, a decision was made that the two horse tram tracks still existing in our city... Skip that. - The tragedy of an artisan of Debrecen. - Skip that. - What will happen in the Balkans? - Skip it. Where's the ox trichina? According to the method of doctor Hartwin, a veterinary of Berlin... ...on windy sand hills and watery lowlands farmers fight nature to force out rye one year and maize the other year. The surrounding ages old oaks seem to... Well? ...seem to mourn their perished companions and look sadly at the sparse, bad, thin-stemmed corn. Let's leave something for tomorrow. I'd read this with pleasure. That is enough. It'll give me silly dreams again, like last night. What dreams? I dreamt that a big cat had caught me and I was a little worm in its mouth. A mouse. Then I became a cloud as I looked after it. Then I ate pastry. Then I saw the Hortob?gy planted with peas. Then I became a big ox and I had to stop eating pastry, I had to graze up the peas that I hated all my life. The peas. That' s what I dreamt. I didn't forget it in the morning because it spoilt my stomach. Shall I put more logs on the fire? Did I tell it correctly, Mrs. Csia? You did except you left out the water. What water? That the cat swam across the water. Right! You know it better than I do! How is it in numbers, Mrs. Csia? The cat's 85, the cloud 73, the pastry 39, the ox 45 and the water 22. All of them have numbers? All of them. For the lottery. You never tried it? Never. A virgin hand. A sure win. Listen. I'll tell you something. Let's try it! That's it! In the worst case we lose 6 krajcars. Here' s a forint note. If we have the cake, let's have it all! If we win, half of it is yours. - 85. - 85. - 39. - 39. - 73. - 73. - 45. - 45. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Give me a cigar, please. - Take your choice. One forint... Well lad, in the end you'll win the jackpot. - Here. - Thank you, a lottery ticket? - No, thank you. - A newspaper. - 6 krajcars. Here you are. Good night. Late again? Give me some, too! Don't be so stingy! Me, too! Here's Misi! Still it was great impertinence to open it. Was there no letter in it? Here, here's a letter. The cone was wrapped in it. It's not allowed to send letters in a parcel. Where is the cream? What kind of cream? My mother wrote that she prepared some cream for my hands against the wind and for my boots so that they shouldn't soak through. Cream? So it was cream in the mug that you spread on the bread? - Who did it? Not you? - Let me see it! Look! He ate it up and now he throws the blame on us. A bloody scoundrel. Wasn't it you who smeared the most of it? No, because you didn't give me any. You impertinent one! You swine! Don't shout here, go over to your own room! - You gobbled it up! - I thought it was butter. I haven't eaten any of it. I said it stank. A bit yes, yet it was good. Good for a healthy stomach. I completely forgot about you. Poor little thing! I'll cure you and I'll bring food for you. You see they ate it up, this is all they left. Go on, you eat, too. Go on! Don't be so sad! Eat some! Now I'll read the letter to you. I promised not to send a parcel for we haven't any money for it. Yet your father persuaded me to send one but don't boast with it, my little son, for this parcel is as poor as we are. The cream... The cream your father made from tallow, you should use for your hands and your boots. Thank Heaven, we are healthy, take care of yourself, my little son. Do your best to learn well, for what would we do if you couldn't learn and live there for nothing. Therefore you should always obey your kind teachers and be good, my little boy, be good unto death. Be good, be good unto death. Your loving mother and father. The bell. I must leave now, you poor little bird. - Good night. - Good night. I hear shoe blacking in somebody's stomach. In yours B?sz?rm?nyi? It's shining already. What a wretched parcel this was! Wait and see what I'll get. There'll be a whole goose in it. Disperse! I like being a student of Debrecen so much! Prophecy about the First School by Mih?ly Csokonai Vit?z. Although this charming province was to the muses devoted, For the lack of every science it was noted. Only dust and brushwood here, where only hogs were reared? Why among the peasants only swine-herds appeared? Where the Hungarian spirit lies unused, defeated. Here compatriots felt indeed themselves maltreated. Knowing nobody cared about the youth of destination. And our country shall be Helicon's incarnation. You could recite it more beautifully than this idiot. In these shabby clothes? Impossible. But I don't mind. I'll have a Csokonai album and a lottery ticket. What? Let me see it! Heavens! It's the old soldier's turn. Attention! Ladies and gentlemen! It's our college's noble tradition to commemorate year after year those noble patriots who made their contribution to our college's foundation and helped maintain it. - Give it to me. - But not only in the past was there a need of the generosity of patriots. The college is having hard times in our days, too. Our Alma Mater, like a good mother, feeds many poor students whose talents can only blossom thanks to our benefactors. What will you give me if you win? Our cook plays lottery too but she's never won anything yet. Who gave you money for it? The ticket belongs to Mr. P?salaki, only half of it will be mine. - How much did he give? 6 krajcars? - No. One forint. One forint? One forint? Dear me, that would do for the jackpot itself! What's your name? Mih?ly Nyilas II. /b. You're a scholarship holder, aren't you? That was rather nice behaviour. And just from you, just at the school celebration. - Please, Professor, I really... - I was watching you. That's it. They're all sneaky. You may be off. Who are you waiting for? Professor Gy?res sent for me. Professor Gy?res! Someone is to study Latin and mathematics every Wednesday and Saturday with the Doroghy boy. Would you take on his teaching? I would. That's good. Go see them this afternoon. - A good family, a fine one. - Yes, sir. They'll pay 2 forints a month. Do your best. Yes, sir. - Mind, I don't want to be disappointed in you. - No, sir. Good morning. I've come to teach Sanyika. Do the Doroghy's live here? The little professor! So you've found us! Come in, here is Sanyika. Poor mother is paralytic. Here's your teacher, Sanyika, go on learning, my pet! Hello. We only have two rooms but we won't bother you. The important thing is that Sanyika learns well. We weren't always living like this... but you will, won't you, my treasure... Go on learning my darling! - Go on, dear little professor! - Right. Let's take the homework for tomorrow. Let's see the Latin first. As we know, all Latin verbs have three roots. - What's this? - A stable. - A stable? - A stable for horses. You catch some flies, tie them with yarn, drop some ink on them and if they climb across then they plough. If they don't, I put them in here. Let's plough. No. Put the flies aside. Well, then. In Latin all verbs have three roots. - Three. - Three. The presens root, then the...? Then the... then the... Perfectum root and the third is the supinum root. You surely know that. Now let's take a verb. Clamo, clamave, clamavi. - What does that mean? - To shout. What's its presens root? I wish I knew! Think! I'm sure you know it. Hush! Listen, I'm teaching but I'll finish soon. Who taught you to teach, Misike? I'm only helping. I couldn't teach at all. It isn't easy. But I like doing it. Well, how many roots do the Latin verbs have? Two. Well, I never saw such a stupid boy as Sanyika! - What did you say? - You're awfully stupid! You'd better not buy yourself a Japanese fan! - Yet he has the sense to nag! - For 60 krajcars! - Don't you criticise me, you puppy! - You're a puppy! You impertinent thing, you'd better learn the elements of arithmetics! How dare you to speak to me like this?! What's up again? Bella is disturbing us. She doesn't let us study. You! Oh you liar! Miss Bella is not disturbing us. We'll ask Bella not to come in next time. Hello, father! Hello! Be quiet, you! What have you brought, Father? What are you learning? Latin verbs. The bases of the presens root, the perfectum root and the supinum root. Really? Are you such a big fool? You can't even learn this? You'll become a cobbler's apprentice. Father takes the whole thing rather lightly. You could thrash him soundly. For whose sake does he learn?! For mine? If only I could have learned! But I couldn't. A girl can never be more in her life than a dirty servant, even if she has brilliant brains. But this boy, if I can force him up to university, he'll be the pride of our ancient family! He must learn. If he passes the final examination, everything will open before him. All the palaces of our relatives, the casinos, the clubs... To whom can I give this girl of ancient Doroghy blood?! Who'll marry her? She'll be a commoner's wife, and she can go shopping to the market... But this boy! He can even marry an earl's daughter. He should only struggle through secondary school! A count's daughter, a prince's daughter, anyone! Enough learning for today. Nyilas! Come here! What are you doing in this house? - Teaching. - You are? Sanyi Doroghy, my school mate. So you probably know the middle girl, Bella. - That beautiful one. - I know her. Well, then come. Wait for me here. You'll surely win. You've been promising that for two years. Yet I never win. - Excuse me. - Good luck. Here you are. That Csokonai book. It isn't in the shop window any more. Csokonai? I've sold it. That was mine! I wanted to buy it! Wait a little. I have it. Here. Csokonai. It costs 50. No, 60 krajcars. Take it. What's this, Nyilas, you squander money like this? - Stationary with envelope. - Thank you. Come. Give this to the Doroghy girl. To that beautiful one. But only to her. Am I allowed to do this, Mr. T?r?k? What a cowardly lad you are! You must do it! But don't open it, you rascal, or I'll complain against you. Well, get along. Professor Gy?res is coming! Let's sit down at once! Hurry up! Gy?res is coming! Sit down! Gy?res overslept again today. Maybe there won't be a lesson at all. Let's send sentries! Let's send Orczy! Let's send Orczy! Cheers! Cheers! All right, I'll go. But Nyilas should join me. I'm not allowed to. - Nyilas? He's a coward. - You're a sneak. - Come along. - All right. Three cheers for Nyilas! What are you doing here? Nothing. Look. Professor Gy?res's window. The curtain is still down. - Are you scared? - No. Strolling about? Well, I don't care. Have you delivered the letter? I'll go there only tomorrow. Tell the miss that she should answer only "with pleasure" or "by no means". Understand? Who was he? Mr. T?r?k, the son of my last year's landlord. What did he want? Nothing. Just nothing. - They' re collecting. - What? They are collecting for the students. The students... Are they begging? It's no shame to collect for the scholarship holders. What are you doing here? Spying? To the class at once! You'll give an account for this. Gy?res is coming! Gy?res is coming! Attention! Gy?res is coming! Sit down. Orczy, hand out these papers! Yes sir! Nyilas! Mih?ly Nyilas! Translate the following sentence into Latin. He who steals the confidence of a man is also a thief. How do you translate it? Quick! How do you say 'thief'? - Fur, furis. - Well? Etiam ille est fur... Go on! Qui... Man. Homo, hominis. Confidence? Confidence? Fidutia. Now together. Etiam ille est fur qui fidutiam hominum furat. Furat! Don't say such crazy things! You shouldn't coin new words. Rapit. Well? Etiam ille est fur qui fidutiam rapit... hominum rapit. So he who steals a man's confidence is a thief, too. Remember this. Sit down. Let me see your copy book. Dear me, the best mark! And yours? That's only very good. Aren't you glad? I'll box your ear. Orczy! For the next lesson translate the following sentence. The law... No. Nobody is allowed to break the law. Yes, sir. Good afternoon. How good you've come, Misike! Help me fetch the leaven from up there. It's up there covered with a white cloth. Thank you. Miss Bella, J?nos T?r?k sent this letter. Who is this J?nos T?r?k? The son of the man who was my landlord. What kind of man is he? A carouser. You gave it to him hot. J?nos Edel?nyi T?r?k, he must be a fine one. He also said you should tell me "With pleasure" or "by no means". Tell him Misike, but don't forget it: "With pleasure by no means" or "By no means with pleasure". Understand? Only that. "With pleasure by no means" or "By no means with pleasure". - All right? - All right. The dishes are still here! That's absurd! What is absurd? I sifted flour. That's the first thing. And the dishes are still here the whole day unwashed. I won't ruin my hands! Your hands?! What are your hands for?! The lady doesn't want to put her white hands into the dish-water. You won't spare them when they'll be black and grimy like mine. Only I should sacrifice myself for this family?! Heavens! I quite forgot about you. He came for warm water, they're melting gum Arabic. Right, Misike? Right. Here. Let's take another verb. For example amare. What' its presens root? Ama. Right. What's its perfectum root? Ama. ...vi, Amavi. What's its supinum root? What does the word amare mean? To love. What's its supinum root? Ama... ama... Well? Unsatisfactory! You've got a bad mark again. Don't disturb us, I'll complain! Viola! Why? Because you got a bad mark? If you want to know, it was difficult. Fourteen boys got bad marks. Nyilas too? He got the best mark. It's good you remember. Why can't you be as likeable, as good, as clever as Misike? Go out! Understand? Go! You know what? Let's make up. Let's stop telling on one another. Give me your hand! Oh, swine! Viola won't need to buy a piglet. Viola! Stop shouting or I'll teach you a lesson! Do you hear?! Viola! Well, good news or bad news? Yes. What, yes? What did she say? She said, by no means. By no means with pleasure. Oh, you idiot! You don't know at all what she said. But I do. She said, "by no means with pleasure", or "with pleasure by no means". What? That's impossible. She sent back the letter as well. I'm sure you didn't even talk to her. Sorry, I have no time for such things. Lottery ticket. A two headed calf was born. Skip that. General meeting of the church district. Skip that. Modernising the traffic of our city... Skip that. Haven't the numbers been drawn yet? It's not in the papers yet. - Not yet? - No. Too bad. Not even in today's paper? No. Carry on, then. No more coughing. 17, 18, 39, 40, 45, 73, 85. I never hit the jackpot. 39, 45, 73, 85. If only I had such luck just once! - The papers from Budapest. - All right. Cigarette. I always miss by a hair's breadth with this bloody lottery! Look! 17, 85, 39, 73, 45. The same happened to me. First listen to this! Here! 18 missed, 83 missed! Put it down there. He, too has a lottery ticket. - 82. Is the goulash any good? - Very good. Show me the ticket. Have you won? Nothing. Not one was drawn. Have you won? Was it from Pest or from Bruno? Not one was drawn. Yes. A young man collected the winnings. If I had known, I'd rather have had my hands cut off! What will Mr. P?salaki say to this? Terrible! - Sir! - Yes? They drew the numbers. Four out of the five numbers! Well... On my way home I thought I'd drop in. Then I see the numbers. I ask the tobacconist. She says the money has been collected. God in Heaven! Help us in this great trouble! Who collected it? - She said a young man had. - And little Misi Nyilas? God be merciful! What will happen now? Maybe he's been killed. Cat, 85, cloud, water... I lost the lottery ticket. What shall I do now? Nobody will believe the truth. Nobody believes me here. But you do, don't you? You are my only friend. What was the homework for today? Let's hear! Mih?ly Nyilas! Go out! Don't you hear? Well, my dear boy, what was your homework for today? What? It was France, wasn't it? What is France like? You see, it shows a dual image. In the East there are mountains, plains in the West. Aren't you prepared? You're a rather impertinent person, my dear boy. Professor, you haven't filled in the log book. You haven't filled in the log book. Of course. The log book. And here in France there is that Orignac. Now in 1852 here a roadman brought to light a most interesting prehistoric burial place. We say prehistoric. Well, when did history begin? Maybe the day before yesterday, because even now, here... well, near D?sseldorf, what's its name? What on earth is its name? Neanderthal. There. There. All right, well... not far from Neanderthal among the diluvian fossils they found... All right, my boy! Excellent. - What's the matter with you? - I'm ill. He's ill. I knew it before. Why didn't you say so? Such a fool! I know what's wrong with him. He lost his lottery ticket. - Is that true? - It isn't. There's nothing wrong with me. Leave me alone. He answered with a shrug of his shoulders. If Nyilas shrugs his shoulders he gets the best mark. If B?sz?rm?nyi does it, he gets a bad one. That's life. They stick together. The eminent ones. Leave me alone. If I catch the dirty ears of this rascal, I'll tear them off. - Mih?ly Nyilas! - Yes. The principal wants you. Come along. - Why this call? - I don't know. An angry call. I don't like it. Allow me to report, I've brought Mih?ly Nyilas, student of class Il/b. What does this mean? What kind of lottery have you embezzled? Speak out, friend! It's good you've come, the highly respected gentlemen of the police have come here to investigate, to question, they broke in like gendarmes, nowadays not even the college is respected before the law. I beg you humbly, highly respected principal, the chief of police asks you not to take our arrival so rigorously. No! Shall I take it as an honour? It's the latest order of the Minister of Home Affairs. I don't give a damn about the Minister of Home affairs, or the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and if you wish to know, I don't care about Ferenc De?k and the whole compromise! Here I'm the autonomy of the College and you shouldn't dare to offend it! I beg you humbly Mr. Principal... Don't beg anything! Do you know, gentlemen, who this boy is? An excellent student, a scholarship holder, the pride of our College! The model of honesty and reliability! Now I introduced the defendant. And good-bye to you! A nice thing! Because of you the whole college got into such a plight! But if you think that now all is settled, you're mistaken, my friend! Istv?n! Professor Gy?res isn't here? - Here's waiting outside. - He should come in. - At your service, sir. - Take a seat. Tell me, professor, do you know this student? Of course I do, he's my pupil in class Il/b. Do you know about his lottery story? Lottery story? I don't. You don't. Well, then tell him everything my boy, for the professor doesn't know. Professor, it happened like this. I read to a blind gentleman every day for ten krajcars. Do you? That's very nice. Ten krajcars every day that makes 3 forints a month. It must be a great help for your poor father. And old Mr. P?salaki... P?salaki, the one time town counsellor? - That's him. - Yes. Old Mr. P?salaki gave me 1 forint to buy a lottery ticket with the numbers he dreamt of. - Dreamt? - Yes. What an old fool! He plays the lottery because of a dream! Yes. His washerwoman gave him the numbers. Washerwoman? To hell with this old fool! In his old age he associates with washerwomen to interpret dreams! I hope you won a lot of money for him. No. It happened like this... Of course not! He's an old fool! So P?salaki lost 1 forint and the chief of police sends his men here. Go back to your class. What lesson do you have now? - Mathematics. - Go, there's a good boy. - Because of such an old fool! - Incredible! - Take one. - Thank you. Allow me to tell you that I still wouldn't have kicked out the policemen. The orders of the Minister of Home Affairs concern the College, too. How was it? What did the old soldier say? - What did they want? - Nothing. What happened? What did the old soldier want? You don't know what he wanted? Leave me alone. He's as stubborn as a mule but I know how to manage it. I'll knock it out of him. - Will you tell me or not? - Leave me alone. You've screwed up. - You won't tell us? - I won't! No, you won't, you won't? Forgive me, I didn't mean it. Does it hurt very much? Forgive me. You rude bastard! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? The heap is too small! What's going on here? Don't you hear?! Line up! Line up! I said. To the gymnasium! March! One- two, one-two, one-two. What's going on here? Don't you hear?! Come down at once! Come here! Come! What is it, torn the tape on your drawers?! Once more! Let's see how brave you are! Sprint! Don't you understand?! I said: Run! Don't you understand?! I said: Run! Push him for if I do it he'll fly all the way to the church tower! Start! Again! You refuse to obey?! Impertinence! Of course the scholarship holder gentleman! I'll have you thrown out double quick! - Mih?ly Nyilas is ill. - I didn't ask you. I beg your pardon but the truth is the truth. Come here! Here! - What's your name? - Vilmos Orczifalvi Orczy. Next time don't poke your nose in other people's affairs. If he's ill he shall leave the queue. You'll jump instead of him. Come on! Didn't you hear? Stand out! Congratulations. Why on earth do they send such worms here?! Stand at ease! Nyilas has fallen! Class! Attention! - What's the matter with you? - Nothing. I'll bring some water. - One-two, one-two. - Hurry. Drink it. It's brandy. This drunken ox drinks brandy from a water glass. Damn his guts. I always dreamt of flying away from here to Budapest or even further away. You see, miss Bella, our souls are alike. I can't endure it here any longer either. I just got my heritage. I'll take you away from here. One day I'll be as strong and brave as Colonel Simonyi was and then they'll all stick to me, you'll see. Do you believe it? I even wrote a poem about him. About Colonel Simonyi. Let's see how it goes. Good Colonel Simonyi in his tender years Climbed up the red tower, he had no fears, Real high was the tower and lofty the spire. The roof was full of sparrows, chirping on fire. I heard this already yesterday, the day before yesterday, too. Always empty promises but you don't pay the rent. Don't be afraid we won't escape with your money. Where have you been? I won't worry if you escape. I'm fed up with you. I won't be sorry fur such tenants. You can only put on airs. But you don't want to pay the rent. I won't allow such a tone! Won't you miss? Damn this whole rabble! If you don't pay I'll throw out the whole lot! Where have you been? Just loafing about?! Am I a prisoner?! Have I no right to go anywhere?! Must I mould away here?! You won't squander the money on Japanese fans. We could add it to the sum for a farming lease. But then, in the spring we'll go out digging, sowing! And Miss will stay home to do the cooking and washing up. The roof... fell... - Hello, Nyilas. - Hello. We discussed everything with Gyimessi. Don't try to deny it, you lost the lottery ticket or it was stolen from you. Come on, make up with Gyimessi. Come. Shake hands. Nothing happened after all. Yesterday afternoon our cook said that one can win even two thousand forints on the lottery. Two thousand Forints! Dear me! Capital! We three ought to form an alliance. An alliance until death? Of course, otherwise it doesn't make any sense. - Like Csokonai and his pupils? - Yes. - Silence, boys, go on learning. - Let's go! Take your books, no loafing. First of all we have to secure secrecy. We won't tell anything to anybody for the thief mustn't get wind of anything. - Agreed? - Agreed. - So help you God? - So help me God. Then let's elect a president now. - I vote for you. - So do I. All right, I accept it but then you must obey the president in everything. I prepared already the fundamental rules. First rule. Name: Lottery players. Second: The members form an alliance sealed with blood like brothers. Like the seven chieftains. Third rule: No secret can exist among us. Dear me! Of course not! Fourth rule: Election of president, secretary and notary. - I'd like to be the notary. - And I the secretary. Gyimessi is the secretary. The secretary must be you. The secret is yours. You are so kind to me. You care for me so much. That's why I confess to you that I have another secret, too. I have a jackdaw. And I've already written a poem. What kind of secretary is this? He must be a notary. He writes poems. This doesn't concern the topic. All right, all right. Come over this afternoon at 5 to discuss things. Now I must go for my piano-lesson. Come on, Nyilas! What would you do if a girl promised you something and then she'd let you down? What would I do? I'd beat her soundly. Has she promised you something? No. I was just curious. Good afternoon Misike. Are you angry with me? Tell me, tell me. I'm not angry about anything. Good. Do you have a lot of homework? We have enough. Then go ahead, Mr. Misi. Hurl me down, who cares, I have a thousand wings. Though look for me with envy the hideous, today things! Hurl me down, who cares... with envy... ...have a thousand wings... Misike, you write poems? Give it to me, Misike, my sweet! No. I'll die if I can't read it I know you wrote it to me. - Colonel Simonyi... - No... Please, don't... Shall we do some learning? Tomorrow we'll have Latin, won't we? No, my friend, mathematics. Of course. Then solve the problems. Have you finished the multiplications? Not yet? The only thing I don't know is whether I should begin multiplication with the first or the last figure. Dear me, it's all the same! Do you understand? All the same! If you start it from the back you put the figures one row ahead. If you start from the front you put the figures one row behind. Understand? Understand. But where shall I begin now? From the front or from the back? It's all the same. Start it from the back. You see. That's all I wanted to know. You're just as nasty as Voila. Please, Misike, come here for a minute. Yes, Miss. Misike, I'd like to ask something. If somebody is very poor and she has the opportunity not to be in want any more, and she could even help her parents and relatives, - is it allowed to miss that chance? - It isn't. Misike, give this poem to me as a souvenir. Don't be angry with me. - Who are you looking for? - Orczy. Our little pet? Well, get inside. Knight's move, knight's move. Not regular. Here or here. Here or here. All right now? - Now it is my turn. - All right. Go on. Orczy! Orczy! Hello, Misi! Hello. Come, take off your coat. We're in great trouble, I'll tell you about it later. Now I'll introduce you to mother. Let me introduce Mih?ly Nyilas. He's my schoolmate. Are you the friend of my son? Do you like my son? Do you quarrel sometimes? Orczy never does. Who? Orczy? Dad! Come quick! Your son is already an Orczy. - Get ready, darling, we'll be late. - Let's go to my room. Sit down. Help yourself. Bad news. Somebody has drawn the money already. Our cook, Fanni went to the tobacconist's and she told her. Here, taste this. Fanni! That lottery ticket was his. Was it? What a terrible disaster! The tobacconist was quite dismayed. She doesn't know who took it. She only knows that it was a tall young man with brown hair and a twirled moustache. How terrible. With a twirled moustache? Wasn't his moustache curled? She didn't say that but it could be. I must go now. - Do you know who it was? - I'll go and find him. Drink your cocoa first. Tell me, who was it? Don't hide it. I'll tell you later. I know that... Hey, kid. Help me carry this bag. But take good care of it, there's money in it. Please, Mr. T?r?k, I know that there... Mr. P?salaki... Give it to me! I'll give you 10 forints. Will you take it? Thank you, I won't take it. Don't be a fool! Here! Good luck! Let's go! I'll buy the tickets. Get in! Slow train leaving from platform 1 to Budapest! Misike. Please, Miss Bella, don't go away with Mr. T?r?k, he's a scoundrel. You don't understand such things. Go home. Get in! To Budapest! "With silent lips on a dry branch, how long will you sit, you listless birds?" Don't want to go to the theatre, you soaked sparrow? Of course he will, such a capitalist! I wanted to see the "Red purse" but today another play is on. I've no leave. The principal is over there! You'll give me the ten krajcars later! Have a good time! I received sixty forints a year. That was all a teacher could get in those times. And even that was collected by the society's enthusiasm. Generous people took it upon themselves to save the souls of the young generation for the Hungarian future. We were full of fire, enthusiasm. Teaching didn't mean making money to us, but a mission. Let's elope, let's elope, my darling. Let's elope, let's elope, girls like that. - We'll elope! - Everybody is my guest today! - Who is that? - Mih?ly Nyilas. - Where've you been? - In the theatre, Mr. Nagy. - Why don't you turn on the light? - I can see without it, too. So you were in the theatre. Why didn't you ask for permission? Here is the ticket, Mr. Nagy. What's this? Ten forints? Did you win on a lottery? Well, don't lose your money. Good night. Good night. Be off, Gyimessi. Yesterday you didn't come to me, you're excluded. Go to hell! Father talked to the chief of police, he's in his hands, he does everything my father wants him to. But you must tell me who the thief is. - I can't because of Miss... - What Miss? I can't tell you. So you have secrets! Go to hell! Mih?ly Nyilas! Come to the principal! They call you again. I don't like it, I don't like it! You little rascal, each day something else? Do you know this lady? I do. Our whole life is ruined. He probably knows something about my sister. Why should he? You may go now. Please, sir, Mr. T?r?k ordered me to hand over a letter to Miss Bella. - You see? - What? How did you get mixed up in that love affair? I teach Miss Viola's little brother at Professor Gy?res' order. - What? You teach him? - I do. - For money? - For two forints a month. So you teach as well. The lady hasn't told me this. You can have no claims from this boy. He has done no harm. He's an eminent student. He's the pride of the class. He has nothing to do with the love affair of those grown ups. Please, sir, I think Misi knows much more. You shouldn't think anything. This child knows nothing. Please go home and calm down. Things will be all right. Have faith in God. And anyhow, leave my students alone. Good-bye. Good-bye Miss. You little rascal, do you have to be mixed up in everything?! The whole world comes to me because of you! What was the use of carrying love letters?! In the end I will have to think that you had something to do with that affair yesterday, too. Now listen, I warn you, if I see your dirty face here once again, you'll fall through the window! Understand? And now clear out of here! Why aren't you in the class? I'm ill, Mr. Nagy. - Have you been to the doctor? - I haven't. Then go there quickly. You're deadly pale. What's wrong with you? Why did the old soldier call you again? I am ill. I must go to the doctor. That's why he called you? You won't believe anything bad about me, will you? Orczy excluded me. Ask him to come here. That bloated blockhead?! Never. This once only. All right. This once. Nyilas wants you. He's hiding things. I won't go. He says he won't come because you always keep things back. What have I done? Why does everybody hurt me? Well be having mathematics lesson. Dear me, I'd like to be in your shoes! J?ska Gesztely! The notorious outlaw's true history in lifelike pictures! Original, artistic pictures! Come nearer! Here's J?ska Gesztely, who has never stolen only taken away! Here is his faithful, beautiful lover who gave him up later. J?ska Gesztely is drinking in the inn, he doesn't guess yet what his fate will be. How bad I am to you, you haven't eaten for such a long time. Though my mother wrote that I should be good. Why do I have to be bad? I wanted to be good to everybody. It's not good to live like this. To be a grown up that's good. Then I'd give that scoundrel Mr. T?r?k a sound thrashing. Forgive me. Why don't you attend class? I'm ill. Have you got a paper from the doctor? I haven't. Let's go. Why do you have to report every day? Have you got into mischief? - The result of the investigation. - Yes. You rascal, what did I promise to you the day before yesterday?! Can't I have even an hour's rest because of you?! Soon I will have nothing else to but to wash your laundry clean! Here is a heap of papers, the whole investigation. And that's not all! Is this how you return my generosity you gallows-bird?! But now we'll find out everything even if you don't say a single word... What on earth is that lottery? Why haven't you gone to Mr. P?salaki's for 4 days to read? And why did you stop teaching? This rascal confuses everything wherever he appears. The life of the T?r?k's, of the Doroghy's. And Orczy's father! For weeks I can think only about one thing, that an impertinent, depraved student will ruin the college's authority. - Istv?n! - Yes, Sir. - Is Professor Gy?res in? - Not yet. Not yet! Idlers! I can be here but he can't. But I'll make order in this depraved, rotten college or leave the whole thing! I won't be the puppet of idle professors and blasted students! - Go to the class! - But please... All right, wait. Istv?n! At your service. Take this brat to the detention room. But lock him up well! Yes, sir. Let's go. Is there anything else? What shall I do? In the interest of the college's authority you should take more serious steps. Come, come! I hope the principal won't be angry with me. We're angry. But you mustn't be afraid of it. Our anger is not as dangerous as the goodwill of others. Then lead me to jail, Uncle Istv?n, so that the principal shouldn't be angrier. We only said that. Because we closed the jail a good ten years ago... I did no harm. I wanted to be good to everybody. If you really did nothing, you mustn't be afraid of anything. Let's think of our mother and nothing wrong will happen. Only you mustn't hide anything. I have a jackdaw. A jackdaw? That's not regular. And what about that jackdaw? I wasn't afraid of telling him all my secrets. The jackdaw. Not bad. But don't hide anything here either. - Istv?n! - At your service, sir! Summon the Disciplinary Committee! The Disciplinary Committee? Well, inform the professors. At your service, Sir. Our honourable principal likes to shout. We'll see. We'll examine the affairs. Stay there! Good colonel Simonyi in his tender years. Climbed up the red tower, he had no fears. Real high was the tower and lofty the spire. The roof was full of sparrows, chirping on fire. Come. I won't interfere in the affairs of the Disciplinary Committee. Do your duty. Well, you little rascal. This is the Disciplinary Committee, I hope you'll tell everything now. Quite sincerely, though I can't interfere, but the professors... We'll examine him. Come here. You don't take me for a bad boy, do you? That's what we'll try to establish. Let's begin, Mr. Principal. Mih?ly Nyilas of class 2 student of the college, answer the following questions. But I warn you to answer honestly and conscientiously for now it's a question of your life or death. You'll have to answer four groups of questions. The first: How did Mr. P?salaki put you in charge of staking one forint on the lottery. When did you play it? What numbers did you play and what happened to the lottery ticket? It happened like this... I would have liked... What? How? Go on, tell us! ...if anybody asked me once that... I don't know myself. How? Professor Gy?res told me to write down that I'm a thief... Why? Perhaps you're not? I just wished to be a boy like the others. Form-master I have done nothing wrong. It will be the best if you tell us everything sincerely. That will help. Since when have you been teaching at the Doroghy's? I got paid only once. So you remember only through the money. - What do you teach? - Latin and mathematics. - Nothing else? - Nothing. So you don't mind if that boy will fail the other subjects. I beg your pardon but this is beside the point. It isn't. For this fact determines the moral attitude. This is a selfish boy, full of material interests. How many subjects do you teach for your salary, Professor? He's a stubborn worthless child. He even ate the shoe polish. Won't this be a little too much? All right, all right. What connection did you have with Bella Doroghy? A good one. What do you mean by this? Miss Bella is a very good girl. A good girl? Who elopes with a... That's a good girl for him. He rose against me. He refused to obey. Such boys ought to be expelled. How can you speak like this?! Answer me, Mih?ly Myilas, where do you know J?nos T?r?k from? What did he promise you for the lottery ticket? And when did he give you the money? Where are those ten forints? Here's the letter J?nos T?r?k wrote about the whole affair. He put the money in my pocket. You didn't dare to tell us, did you? Give me those ten forints! I confiscate it as a corpus delicti. Well, Professor, what do you say to this? Allow me now dear colleague to put forward some questions. Come here my child. Tell me my boy how could you possibly sell the lottery ticket? Did you need the money badly? Did you? You hoped it wouldn't win. I didn't sell it. Now you say this only because you said this before, too. - I didn't sell it. - A lie! I'm not a liar! None of your backtalk, little rascal, or I'll give you a box on the ear and break your neck! What kind of child are you? What is your father? Don't you hear you dirty one?! What's your father? A carpenter. That is it. He's trained to lie. What kind of father and mother can a brat like this have? How are you looking at me you mean thing? Even the way he looks is bad! I'll tear out your ears! Clear off, you damned scoundrel! He's entirely rotten with a mean character. A saw that in the first minute. This boy knew... about Neanderthal... Though they haven't learned it yet... An eminent student yet such a scoundrel! Eminent student, that's not the world. That means nothing. Brains might be God's present but the devil's contribution as well. All depends from the heart. Exactly. Let him be the cleverest, but one with a vicious heart can't be blissful for humanity. And the traditions of the college of Debrecen do not allow us to give the world brainy criminals. I don't want to be a student of Debrecen any more! He doesn't want to! What do you want to be? Nothing! I don't want to be a child, I don't want to grow up, I want to die! Mother! My son. My dear little son! - Mother... - My little boy... Well, little devil! Do you feel better? It was a little giddiness, wasn't it? He ought to take cod-liver oil. No. That I won't. All right, have a rest, don't worry. Now everything will be all right. Chin up! Miss Bella sent a letter. When she learnt of Mr. T?r?k's villainy she wrote us the truth. And now will you be a student of Debrecen? I won't. Everybody torments me here. Not at all, my little son. All right. There's no need to torment the child. If he doesn't want to, he doesn't. There are other good colleges too. He will think it over later. Good-bye. Well, my son, how will it be now? What do you want to become? The teacher of mankind. Don't say! And what do you want to teach people? To be good... to be good unto death. Now my little one... we're going home. I'll feed you up. - What shall I prepare for you? - Millet-pap in milk. Well, my son. Don't you want to say good-bye to anybody? I don't. Then let's go. I forgot something.
