Hayat. Hayat. It's all over now! Are you okay? Let's unpack our things. Have I ever told you how sexy you look pregnant? Harun! Come in, brother! I just wanted to check if everything is alright. We are nearly done. - We will come in a minute. - No worries, no need to hurry up. - Gülsüm. - What? I'm thinking of having a glass of Raki with Harun. I already told you I don't want this rubbish in my house! You already made me a slave to those strangers. Watch your mouth! That's my nephew you're talking about! Nephew? The one you call 'nephew' married this Kurdish woman. Woman, shut up or you're gonna get some... Slap me, slap me! As making me her maid wasn't enough already, you want to slap me! Good Lord! Sure - 'good Lord'! Psst...they are coming! Children, come in, don't behave like strangers. - Have you set yourself up now? - Yes, we have. Thanks. Honestly, thank you for everything. No worries, it's not worth talking about. Right, Gülsüm? Sure, it's not a big deal! Help your sister my girl, we're going in. Let's join them, brother. They can take care of it, let's have a chat. Let's go! How can I help, sister? Wait! Take this lettuce... ...wash it thoroughly. Here, this is a knife. Wash it well, cut it and put it in here, okay? Did you pickle the vegetables yourself? No my boy, you can buy everything you know from Turkey here. That will never do, children, you're not eating anything! Try the salad! Gülsüm, how often did I tell you not to cut such big chunks. I told her already, but... I didn't know. I'm so sorry, brother. No, no worries, it's delicious, thank you. I swear. - If you like it, eat more! - I eat anyway. Kids... ...why don't you rest a bit and then we'll show you Berlin? We don't want to cause any trouble! What trouble? That's how we could finally get to know the city after 25 years! Right, Gülsüm? I'm already full. Let them take care of it, my boy. Come with me. Your sister will make us coffee. Sure, sure... Sure, she does. Take the glasses! Take the glasses! Follow me. Does one put the big glasses there? They should go on that side. The small ones belong here. Just throw out the salad! You're so clumsy! This is no way to do this! You're definitely going to break it this way. Wash this properly, don't put it in the dishwasher! Have you never used a dishwasher before, Mrs. Teacher? Are you alright? Can you read me a poem? Which one would you like? You pick one! I love you... ...like dipping bread into salt and eating... ...like waking up at night with high fever... ...and drinking water, with the tap in my mouth... ...like unwrapping the heavy box from the postman... ...with no clue what it is... ...fluttering, happy, doubtful. I love you... ...like flying over the sea in a plane for the first time... ...like something moves inside me... ...when it gets dark softly in Istanbul. I love you... ...like thanking God that we live. The situation is very bad, especially for the Kurds. They burned people in their basements. They didn't care; women, children... Look brother, that's what they gave us in Turkey when we got married. Oh great, we'll need this one too. Let's include it in the application. 'Certificate of appointment'! What's that? To hell with it, what on earth is it! I don't understand what this is supposed to be. We'll ask there. Get ready, let's go hand in the papers. You go! I want to clean up. There's no need. Your sister will do it. I can't leave it like that. So I can spend some time on my own. As you wish. Let's go, Harun. Okay brother. Take it easy, okay? If something's up, call me on Irfan's mobile. - Goodbye. - See you. The window. The door. The book. The table. Should I help you? I asked, whether I should help you? Patience, my darling. Everything will be alright. Why come you so early? How long did you want us to be away? What are you doing here? I'm vacuuming! Get out! Good Lord, I'm not even allowed in my own apartment to vacuum! Harun, let's continue later. My girl, I apologize for her! No worries! My love, I'm sorry! What can you do? She is right, this is her flat. As if the vacuuming wasn't enough, she even turns on music. I did something, you won't believe it! - No way! - Way! Should we eat it here? Let's at least go to the window. Did you buy it next to Irfan? No way! Good. It's not as disgusting as they say. Not bad. The taste is not so intense. I love you! I love you too. Quick, hide it! Harun! Come in! Riza is here to see you. I mean Riza, Mr. Hasan's son. When I applied for your invitation to Germany, he pulled some strings. Let's have some coffee, so you can thank him, alright? Alright brother, we are coming. Come brother Irfan. The kids are coming soon. Hi Harun! - Good evening. - Evening. How are you? Good, thanks. How are you? - Thank you, I'm fine as well. - Hi. And how is everything going? Good... Have you gotten used to Germany already? We haven't seen much. Harun, is it possible for you to work as a teacher in Germany? In Germany it's tough to work as a teacher, unlike Turkey. Right Irfan? We'll see. My girl, would you please help your sister? Harun, is she a Syrian Kurd or Arab? Kurdish. And your father, didn't he object? We haven't spoken since the marriage. Really? - It's a pity. - Leave it, Riza... Let's think of getting Harun a job on Abidin's construction site. Our friend Abidin? That won't be a problem. As God wills, he can start at the end of this month. Great! Can you actually work in construction? It's not as easy as teaching. Why shouldn't he! Get him the job, he'll do it. No worries, I'll do it! Gülsüm, sister! Hello! Harun, leave it, I'll do it. Long time no see. Thank you very much, sister Gülsüm. Enjoy it! Here you go, sweetheart. Very tasty. The tea is almost ready. Don't worry, sister. I'll go to have some Raki with them anyways. Just don't drink it here, as for the rest - I don't care. Let's have it another time. But Harun, come on, I'm flying to Turkey tomorrow. Irfan, there is an important match tonight. Germany against Turkey. I won't take a 'no' for an answer. Come on Irfan! Gülsüm, sister, with your permission... Thank you. You should come for dinner sometime. Thank you again and take care. Let's go Harun. - Come back soon. - Of course, sister. Turkey is definitely going to win! Yes, yes, right, go now or you'll miss it! Hayat. It's me! It's me. Don't be scared. Where is Harun? They're not back yet, my child. What's going on out there? They're throwing fire crackers or something like that, but... - Hayat... - I have cramps. You're bleeding! Stay calm, breathe deeply. It's going to be alright. Hayat, I'm going to call the ambulance immediately. Good Lord, what should I do now? Hello Irfan, Hayat has cramps. It doesn't look good. It's bad, can you send an ambulance right away! I went too far! I shouldn't have behaved this way. Allah should punish me. It's all going to be fine, please hang in there! God almighty, please help us... It's all fine my dear. Just let me wash off the blood. Wait, a cramp... It's all going to be fine. Just let your legs loose, my child. Hayat! I'm so sorry. Gülsüm! Irfan. What did you do to her this time? I swear, this time I didn't do anything. She spoke in her sleep. When I came into the room, she was bleeding. I brought her here as fast as I could. Irfan, please ask what's happening? They're not saying anything. Okay, just sit down, I'll go check. Harun! Gülsüm! What is it? I also didn't get it. Room 105, let's go have a look. My love, what happened? We have a son. He's sleeping over there. Why did you bleed so much? Sometimes it could happen under stress. - Are you feeling better? - Yes. Have a look at our little Umut. I brought you a few things. Maybe you'll need them. Thank you sister Gülsüm. I apologize for everything, I'm so sorry. Thank you for helping me. Go, have a look at our Umut. Gülsüm, let's leave the kids alone. Are you crying? Come to me. I was scared that something had happened to you. Nothing can happen to me, as long as you're in my life. Hayat, my child! Can you please get me some parsley from the 'Kühlschrank' (fridge), my hands are dirty. Listen to that, she'll learn German in her age. Why are you making fun of me Serpil? It's just all over the place, right Hayat? Hayat! Chop up just a little bit of it. - Is that enough, sister? - Yes, just give it to me. My stuffing is ready. Nuriye, sister, can you please help me? My stuffing got very good. Girl, help me out! My rheumatism! Give me a piece. Pass me the flour! Flour? You mean dough! - Is this too small? - No, it's good. Come on, tell us about your new neighbors. Look at her, she won't. Who moved in? No, she won't! My sister-in-law saw them. She also lives there. Oh, what do I know, a young German couple moved in above us. And who are they, what do they do? How should I know, I haven't even seen them. But I did hear them. Girl, what did you hear? You have to tell, I'm so curious! She let us bursting with curiosity! What should I tell you? It's the same every evening, first she screams... ...then she starts laughing. This goes on for hours. Every evening? That's not bad. Who can take so much of it? My sister-in-law says, that people who eat pork are much hornier. Such a load of crap! Before mine went to Mecca, I always had to hide. Since Mecca, I've had my peace. They always come at the worst time! Hello sister Nuriye, hello Serpil. Hello Harun. I don't want to disturb you, I'll take a shower. Look at her, she's not any better than the neighbor. To be young again... You say that! The dough is easy to lay out. Can we buy a bed for Umut with this on the weekend? I'll ask, if I'm not working we can do it. Okay. Harun, is everything alright? Yes. I need to rest. Should I bring you anything? Hello. Now? I thought i have the evening off. Okay. Okay I'll come. What happened? The guys from the construction site called. The patrolling is over, I have to go back. - Hayat. - Sister, don't worry about it. Tea is ready, put your book away. No, we just ate. Just ate? There's only skin on your bones. Here, put this on. Oh, did he fall asleep? So you don't get cold. I'll bring him to the bedroom. Nuriye gave me some Börek for you. There's also cookies. Eat everything, it'll give you milk. Eat the fruit as well, it has vitamins! Hello, Irfan. Did you buy bread? I did. Put on your slippers. - Hello. - Hello my girl. - Are you alright? - Yes, thank you. Sister Gülsüm takes very good care of us. Of course, and so she should! Erdogan said some important things in his speech. The talk is always about Kurdish difficulty's. Which kind of Kurdish difficulty's? They don't exist anymore! What more do you want? As a Kurd, were you president of this country? Yes! Did you field a presidential candidate? es you did. Hayat, you received a letter from the State department. Irfan! Did I hear correctly? From the State department? God almighty, don't bring us sad news. Open it! Let's wait for Harun. Come, open it, it'll drive me crazy. We'll tell him when he gets back. No, I can't without Harun. When he comes, we'll open it. Hayat, I envy your patience. Irfan, she thinks of nothing else than Harun. My sweet girl. I have to go back to the kitchen. My little one. What he wants to have? He's not picking up. Where is he? Don't worry, someone from the construction site has a birthday. They wanted to have a drink. Good, but why doesn't he answer. He'll be back soon. Sure, he will come back, but we are worried about him. Why are you so anxious, he'll be back soon. Alright, alright! Do you like it? Very good, thank you. Grandpa, listen to what he's saying to you. - He says: 'I want to eat too'. - Come to your grandpa. Give him a bit of yogurt. His cell phone is still out. Did something happen? - Should we call the police? - And tell them what? He worked illegally, then got drunk and is sleeping somewhere, or what? I'll go to the construction site and find him. - I also want to come. - No, stay here please. I'll call you and let you know. What if they took him and locked him up? Don't say that, Hayat. Irfan will find him and bring him back to you soon. Don't be sad please! Yes my son? - You're Harun's family, right? - Yes, and who are you? Can I come in? Sure, come in. Right over there. Where is Harun? What happened? Sister... Harun... He fell off the scaffold. I tried everything I could, but I couldn't help him. They didn't let me through. There... ...they buried him there, in front of my eyes! If I hadn't had children, I would have shown them, but... ...my hands are tied. We're just like you... ...all we have is our children. Please understand me. I had to think of my children. Allah won't forgive me... ...but you, please forgive me. - Who is that now? - No idea. Hopefully not Riza again! Irfan, who is that? I don't know. The police is downstairs... Police? - Irfan, why they are here? -I don't know! Gülsüm, are they coming for deportation? Good Lord, what should we do now? Just calm down! Yes please! Good evening! I'm Mr. Geller and this is my colleague Mr. Tosun. Good evening! We are searching for Family Madan! Come in! Are you Mrs. Madan? Please stand up. Do you have an ID? She doesn't speak German. Can you show us your ID card? Do you know why we are here? Your visa expired and your request was rejected. You received a letter in which you were ordered to leave the country... ...but you're still here. Where are Harun and Umut Madan? He is asking, where Harun and Umut Madan are? He has run away! He took my son along and run off. Can't you see how this poor girl looks? What is it? She says her husband left with the child. Does he have custody rights for the child? We can't do anything about it. I'll pass on the info. We'll search the apartment, while you get ready to leave please. Please follow us. Good evening. Goodbye. Everything will pass my child. Please keep your head up. Put on this jacket. "To live like a tree alone and free "like a forest in brotherhood "this yearning is ours!" Nazim Hikmet
