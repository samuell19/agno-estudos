anything if you say one word you die wow uh so is at this hour there remains no word from the man who left two dead this morning in the bloody kidnapping of photo american women athletes from hong kong sports arena president ford has called the incident as foul a blow to international understanding as i can remember and supermarket tycoon bennett douglas has offered to pay any ransom demanded for the release of his daughter and the other girls douglas is at this moment preparing to leave for hong kong to work with us embassy officials who report that progress is being made on the case what about those senate hearings you know according to the news media the cia has infiltrated every place in the world from what i've heard you guys have spies and every girl scout troop in asia so if you got so many spies why can't you do a little goddamn spine yeah i'll wait what else am i supposed to do look up the kidnappers on the yellow pages they ought to change their name to just central agency their intelligence is nil you give a man a lot of hope rusty wade now we've been expecting you have a seat any new developments well they're chinese according to the witnesses two of them were chinese so we figured that the rest are also i don't know i just don't know what figures anymore mr reed what are you doing about it i'm waiting just like you're waiting just like the cia's waiting just like the world's waiting i'm just sitting and waiting i'm not gonna just sit here and wait mr reed while pamela's out there in trouble be glad it's not just her not just her but my three best girls one of them is ginger douglas now that guarantees us that the world will be keeping an eye on this yeah a couple of black girls don't guarantees a thing does it that's not what i meant it doesn't matter what you meant it's the way things are yeah i don't much like the way things are i don't much like waiting that's all we can do oh this is insane if they wanted us to give them something or confess to something but there's nothing i never depended on anyone in my life yeah well it's time you learned it's time you shut up hey listen if we get out of this mess it's going to be because of me my family knows everybody they know that dude in the hall hey what's your family going to do for us the same thing they've always done wash your underwear you know how you always see the woman in the cowboy movies that's tied up and she rubs ropes against the chair and gets loose yeah don't believe it you're not gonna get away with this that's all you get [ __ ] what's going on i put that bite on him did you bite it off that's next all right all right that's enough what's going on it changes they want five million hong kong dollars the details come later then they'll let the girls go right no what do you mean no the government has uh declined to come up with the money they've done what wait a minute wait a minute the government no whose government nobody's asked me to vote man now who makes that decision whoever makes those decisions it wasn't me so what now we hope that bennett douglas comes up with the five mill i hope he doesn't try to make a deal for his own kid leaving [ __ ] on their own hey don't call him that i call my goddamn well please man now this was new york of y'all busting heads in 15 minutes i know what's going on you want to try it i'm not going to stop you it would make my life one hell of a lot easier if somebody could find them i got 20 reporters waiting out there i don't need that i wouldn't know where to start well maybe i could put you in touch with someone who might be able to help you nick dorenzie he's worked with the cia i don't want any cia man he's worked with a communist he's worked with the russians he's probably even worked for the goddamn ethiopians somebody told me that nick had been paid in every kind of money there is in the world now if there's anybody that knows what's going on in hong kong it's nick dorenzie i already made the transfer of the money to your bank in switzerland the hong kong police commissioner wants to thank you personally for the things you've done mr chua extends his apologies regarding last week's heist he begs for an audience with you to make peace by the way the rumor about the manila people is true they'll be here soon what do you mean they are here welcome to hong kong uh huh um thank you nick dorenzie yes rusty wade hiya uh have a drink while i finish my business it won't take long so so oh you have to forgive me this it's been one of those days you have everybody tell me uh you really nicki remzy what do you want a business card well i figured you'd be you know different caller i had to change my name you know business how seriously would people take a soldier fortune name nico meadows the yang yang nick duranza sounds so dazzy so now how much were your dashing car well depends on how much dashing is required well now you won't have to do it alone tell you what ordinarily i don't like having my employers alone they have a tendency to uh want to make decisions but you may come in handy you don't do a bad job not have bad uh what about these girls of yours move faster now so this is stupid oh all this trouble for nothing we must be philosophical about this it may be difficult for you to remain philosophical about losing five million dollars when a person loses her value she becomes flesh and flesh has a value all its own so we lose nothing we can only profit buy me a drink is that part of our deal i buy the drinks i always get an expense account you want my theory the americans won't pay the ransom because they think the kidnappers are chinese and some idiot in the state department decided that the ransom would be foreign aid they don't give foreign aid to china uh there's a man named lou he's a mercenary that's the same sort of what i do so he's got to price us by him ah it's not that easy he's working with one slang a young radical and i suspect he's behind this plot so it's got to be politics it's possible come on let's get to work you will be kept here for a short time we are just waiting for your government to deliver so any further attempts to fight us will only endanger you needlessly is this understood hey remove the tapes hey listen you're getting your money so you can at least entire us we're american citizens we're being treated like american citizens at least the way this american citizen's always been treated both you just shut up and looking at us a lot so what are we supposed to do until then starve to death you'll be pleased to know we've sent for food i wanna what are you the den mother at least i got us food didn't i you could have got us killed oh well you two stop yelling at each other what else is there to do 24 hours after their abduction there remains no word from american track stars pamela rogers ginger douglas casey barnes and monica newton american officials refusing to give in to a reported five million dollar ransom demand cited their unwillingness to and i quote encourage this sort of thing president ford has called the incident a slur on the honorable name of international athlete sure did you find anything zero might as well call it a day boss i'll go into the bar right i'll see you see you uh let's go agrees huh let's go eat oh yeah ah i thought the money was unimportant only to you we kidnap them because they're americans we keep them because they're valuable valuable for a cause not for money show me a course that doesn't need money you look like some kind of weird siamese twins i feel like houdini yeah the day forgot the trick i think we're getting it that one he just pulled do it again i don't know which one it was was the one on the left is starting to go the one you just pulled pull it again no that's my right my left what if they come in and find you and tying each other what if they do well all of us could just get killed all right i'll save your life for you we get untied and we'll leave you the way you are come on jackie it's just starting to get loose if we just listen to what they say then maybe we'll be you don't stop talking you're not gonna have to worry about what they're gonna do to you you don't seem to understand miss america we're not on the track anymore this isn't a game they just killed two girls there's nothing to keep them from killing a couple more but they're getting the money when i see the government of the united states handing out money for me that's when i'll believe that oh stop talking like a martyr that's all you're trying to be is another black martyr you wanna get killed not as bad as you do girl god damn it jackie come on i'm doing the best i can fair well if it ain't julia child bon appetit yes so all right the exercise is over mr reed there are two men in the united states senate who owe their jobs to me one word from me and you know what will happen to your job my job does not consist of making national policy my policy mr reed is to pay for what i want and i want ginger back i'm prepared to give them the money where the hell are we welcome to shangri-la oh pardon the smell i don't believe this i mean my father's got to be going crazy absolutely crazy things like this just don't happen in our family i got a sister who's kidnapped well we thought she's kidnapped anyhow up she got picked up for roberto liquor store she was born three days before we heard from her you know it wouldn't make any sense that she was kidnapped the only ransom we could have paid was the rent money and we didn't have that i just wish it wasn't taking so long i mean i can't understand why it's taking them two days to get the money together i wonder how much it is i wonder how much we're worth well not much this isn't exactly first class accommodation i wish i could see the newspapers what are they saying about us i bet we made the cover of newsweek i bet we make the cover of jet it'll be something to show our grandchildren all right i mean all those old clippings this is your grandmother when she was kidnapped back in the 70s hey i think i'll start a scrapbook i just hope we get to see it oh we will if you two don't get crazy again fighting won't get us anywhere i never thought i'd hear you say that i tried it i almost got raped i don't want to hear about that it's nothing to be afraid about this happened i'd rather be afraid yeah i was involved in the job yeah i know i'm wonderful you're okay too yeah i promise you yeah bye-bye oh sleep well what do you want coffee black how come you got an office in a bar nick rusty if i was a carpenter i'd work where they build houses if i was a baseball player i'd work where they play baseball the kind of people i deal with i work in a place like this what do you want me to do open a sound a bath something doesn't feel right and i can't stand the waiting it's all we can do i talked to some people last night started getting the word around that uh we're ready to do business all we can do is wait you think they'll get in touch with us for five million bucks wouldn't you i would have by now i expect the girls keeping them busy you want some i finally understand how from china man is so short i don't know how they ever get any food and been all these damn things it's really a matter of what you grow up with you know my group of knives and forks mostly nines mostly parts of your neighborhood well the best thing about these chopsticks is you don't have to eat too fast a restaurant new york so food like this may be shut down but we'll just have to see if we can get an inspector to come in i think we got our inspector ladies i have an important visitor to see you soon i want you to look presentable hello yes he's here this is bennett douglas i'm prepared to pay the money you asked if i get my daughter back alive let me speak to her i don't take the word of criminals don't make her mad now you're questioning me when i tell you i have the money sir i have it you'll get nothing until i get ginger back i might i might if i see proof she's alive you'll get 10 000 and no more and you'll bring me proof whenever you say i'll let you talk to my associate here i'm afraid i don't know the city well enough i don't know the city either yes we'll be there my i don't like carrying this kind of money you'll get you street the only people i know who carry this kind of money yeah but don't forget that we're going to buy some women and tweets mr wade yeah your friend primal rogers sends her regards when do we get her back when we get the five million dollars did you bring the deposit you bring the proof the wonders of modern technology mr wade who's ever listening to this we're being treated like [ __ ] but we're still alive it's getting dark now this is the third day since we've been kidnapped so you know when we're recording this nobody's forcing me to say this they've got guns pointed at us but that's nothing unusual anymore nobody's telling me what to say we're just waiting for you to bail us out this is ginger douglas we're being treated like animals and we're in a i'm afraid the next part is how do you say classified information uh how do we know you didn't kill the girls after they recorded that why would i kill them of what use would they be dead are you saying lou you have me at a disadvantage nick derensey an unexpected pleasure you know we could do things the two of us i'm already working thanks i could have you killed at this moment i could have you killed yeah but of what use would i be dead did you bring the money yeah inform mr douglas we will speak with him tomorrow when will you release the girls we will speak with mr douglas tomorrow me in the front of every newspaper looking like this i'm ready for my close-ups will be the mill i look like a model from a woman's magazine are you taking us with you are you letting us go now not just yet are you from the embassy you got the money number questions you're still prisoners that's like saying here's a present but don't open until christmas we could still be here christmas no i don't think it'll take much longer now what do you think they'll do let's talk are you sure this lou really has the girls i mean you gave him the money you kept up your end of the bargain why didn't he keep his he played us the recording mr douglas ah you know anyone can fake a recording it's true we're running out of time now those girls are supposed to march at a flower parade if things don't change i may have to put on a wig and march myself wait a minute what when you talked to them on the phone yesterday did you tell them who was gonna bring the money i i'm not sure i believe i did i believe you didn't i believe you just said you're associate didn't you but what possible difference did that make well the difference that it makes is that they said to him are you mr wade what the hell they were supposed to say uh dr livingston i presume but how would they know his name was wade if mr douglas here didn't tell him well i thought i did you didn't well then who did benny what what's your guess who's been talking to those people and what else have they told them other than wade's name oh the hell should i know somebody's gotta know look somebody set this thing up and it wasn't any china when it wasn't the communist but why would mr morris five million dollars maybe how about it benny how's it sound to you how far could you go on five million dollars hey man you're you're crazy how about you and i taking a little walk upstairs are you nuts man look i just want you to meet a friend of mine you're absolutely nuts man ready who the hell is this huh this waiting is getting on everyone's nerves what if lou doesn't release the girl that's a possibility i wouldn't discount knowing you so patience my friend huh patience is a trait i never had nick what's the matter you're afraid of lou it is something you americans will never understand i figured someday he and i ran across a target you could get your chance to settle that competition i'm not sure i could i'm not sure i didn't try wait till they pose a guard on you i don't think he would he had his chance he could have killed us in a minute he and i are the only ones left we killed each other it would give the business a very bad name anytime i came across somebody in the ring who even thought that he was better than me i whipped him but there always be another one look rusty how would you have felt if there's only one other boxer in the whole world i would have fought it and i would have won i'd keep forgetting the american way ladies i have good news you will soon forget all about me and this place this gentleman will be taking you soon to the place from which you will be liberated i thought that would please you why don't we get going indeed since we've had some trouble in transporting you we're going to take a small precaution hey now hold on what are you gonna do to us the drug will only put you to sleep for a few hours we don't have to run some money yet we're gonna take the risk of having you escape you do understand i understand but anybody puts a needle in me is in trouble he doesn't seem to be in trouble yeah now you understand the reason for our precautions do jackie you right up so you see my friends the old rule about playing both ends against the middle is not necessarily true the americans refused to pay as we knew they would but we get paid for our trouble with the ten thousand dollar bonus and then we turn around and do business with mr chang we get money for taking them and we get money for getting rid of them it is not western politics that keeps me from being a communist it is western money it is western money that keeps you from being free and i suppose you'll turn down your share yeah the young are often trapped by their own innocence my only innocence was believing what you said we kidnapped them because we wanted to show the world that the americans did not belong here yet bring them inside hey faster then come on come on come on get up what's wrong with you come on come on let's go mr douglas how soon do you expect the release of the girls i'm interested in the release of my daughter and that's all if the government doesn't care about the other girls why should i i'm no crusader but mr dockless don't you think i think you're wasting my time mr dogmas could you give us an idea i'll give you a punch in the nose if you don't leave me alone but mr rita the embassy you can tell mr reading go to hell we got word that you and the girls are at festival island right i'll be at the ambassador get in touch as soon as you get the information and double check on all long distance calls we place and mind this story rusty something bothers me dog was in festival island too are you okay i don't know i just wish somebody would come for us somebody will be coming from us but it won't be americans what do you mean why do you think we're here they're selling us to what we're being sold as slaves a hundred years of progress and i'm back with my grandmother was
