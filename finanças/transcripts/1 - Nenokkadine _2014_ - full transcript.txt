He is a celebrity But from now onwards he is a murderer Killer. Beyond the imagination, Gautam became murderer. Everyone is shocked knowing about the murder. Time has come for Gautam to sit behind the bars. After he ran murdering and I hunted him down what is the reason behind Gautam becoming the murderer. Revenging his parents murder Gautam killed... Inspector John Badshah chased him and hunted him. This murder revealed other two murders. Police said, other two murder was done in Pune and Ireland. Lets go and see whats happening in real. Its not only the success of John Badshah... Venkat? Sir. Every channel is telecasting the Gautam news... Why is it not in our channel? Sameera has put Gautam news in hold Sir. Where is Sameera? She is in the news room Sir. Sameera? Yes Sir. Why are you holding the Rockstar news? Getting ready Sir. What's the matter tell me I say? I'd shot the exclusive visual relating to it.

The talk relating to the murder done by Rockstar Gautam its creating the sensations. What happened actually? How did that murder happened? That whole murder is shot by our news channel. Here is the exclusive visuals which are beyond your expectations. Subtitles by Mr. Ram Kumar Tamang Don't stare at me. Look there. RAM He seemed beating someone. But no one was there. He fell as if someone beat him. But no one was beating him. All he was alone He was fighting with nobody. He was beaten by nobody. He surrendered to police saying he murdered him. Though Gautam didn't murdered but police created the sensation and made him murder. So without killing anyone Gautam became a murderer. This is the Gautam's reality Here is no any dead body Sir. What is the reason behind doing this? This is the things that we should know Who are you, son? What happened dear? What happened? Tell me? Mother... Mother? Mother... what happened? Father... Mother... They killed them Where? Here... Mother... Here... They killed my Mother here. Here... They killed my father here. Did any murder happen here? Muder? Nothing like that happened... Why are you saying that Sir? This boy is saying that his parents were killed here This boy? This boy is always like that Sir. Whatever bus stops here, he immediately gets in and says "here they killed my mother and here my father". He's little mentle Sir. Don't take it serious Sir. He doesnot have father and mother. Without killing anyone, Gautam became a murder He's little mentle Sir. Don't take it serious Sir. This is called interrogation disorder in medical terminology. Comparing to normal brain, gray matter is 25% less in Gautam's brain. Means it reduces the strength to remember. They thinks those things as real which are fictitious. Gautam doesn't have his parents since childhood He imagined them to be there with him. Whatever he do, that won't be ture. That's why he imagined they were killed by those three who are right now trying to kill him. Revenging them, he feel that he killed them. As a whole he created a revenge story. Knowing that all as unreal he got very disturbed. You don't worry. I'll treat him. Now I'm going to ask you something relating to your past. Do you how does your mother looks? Do you how does your mother looks? I don't know. Do you know how does your father looks? You don't know how was your father and mother But somebody killed them. At least do you know the name of your mother and father? You don't know. Do you know the name of the killers? You don't know. You don't know the name of killers but you killed them. So you killed those who you don't know and where they are you don't know. It may not be true that I killed them But its true that they killed my parents. Every patient always says that No one will accept that they are wrong. I've seen such cases many times What I'm saying is the truth. I've the medical reports to prove that what you are saying is not real. What to you have? Do you have any proof? It this real? Ofcourse. Damn it How do you know? Pain. It pains man. As much you feel that pain and believe it as real I feel mine too and believed it as real. Why? Why am I not imagining you? Why I'm not imagining you? Why I'm not imagining you? Why I'm imagining those three? Because... Those... Those three killed my parents. Do you think a chance that people Gautam imagining are real? Impossible. What if they are Real? IMPOSSIBLE. What truth comes from what type of experiment? Which truth affect the which company? You are the one who knows that. What is that? Don't you know to whom you dare will take your life? Do you think I stopped murdering after entering to the politics? Nobody can dump the truth. Because of you company products, the climate is polluting causing the different types of cancer. People are dying. They don't have any alternatives. So they are dying. You know the truth that's why I'm giving you two choices. Do you need money? Or do you want you life? How many will you kill? One...Two or Three... Or will you kill all? As soon as I called you came without fear. I thought you were here for the money. I understood that you don't need your life. My friend has the information that I'm here. If you kill me, everyone will know about it. Everyone says when I murder there will be no any proof because When I thought of murdering, these types of accedent will happen there. Subtitles by Mr. Kaji Tamang Sir, again Rockstar case...

I thought you getting Rockstar is hard but he is easily fell on you. What are you watching? How does Angel changes her dress, I'm looking that. What? -Dress change??? Why did you record this? To increase the TRP for your double acting. Why are you beating me? Did TRP increase now? Stupid. What's the Gautam program tomorrow? What Sir? After seeing me too why are walking so silently?

Mr. Gautam. Why do you visualize so cheap about me? When I call for the treat, you presuppose it as treat You presume saying me I Love You when I walk near by you. What is your next plan? Will you visualize our dating or what? Anyway you won't give me the interview. At least I want to cover it from a distant. Won't you let me to do that too peacefully? Mr. Gautam don't visualize that every girls from India will express their love to Rockstars like you We journalists come for interviews not for dates. Actually I really expressed my love to you But I can't tolerate no from you so acted right now as interview girl. Grils coming and expressing their love to a Rockstar like you And you rejecting them may common to you. But for normal girl like me its a major issue. I really like you. At least give me a chance to become your one day girl friend. I'll keep it for my life long memory. You are not real. You are just fictional. No no no. I'm genuine. You want me to prove it? Everybody will envision me as mentle if I keep talking with you. I know you are not really here. I'm just imagining you. That's all. Go. Go. How do you know that I'm just fictional? If you were real then you won't be here bringing coffee. You'll be talking angrily. What? You all men are alike. They think our love as fictitiuos and anger as real. Is this angerness enough to prove me as real? Or do I've murder someone? Just...just 2 minutes... I'm giving you 120 seconds time. I'll go and jump into the sea if you don't take me as your one day girl friend. Is there... Is there a girl? White dress? -Ya Yes, she is there. One minute? -Yes. Are there two old peoples in the table? Yaa they are having biscuits. They are there, right? -Yes You'll die if you jump. I'm just fictitiuos. How'll I die? No. You are in real. I know it. Really? How did you know? The two old people sitting there told me. Who? No one is there. Rockstar Gautam interestingly looking at rubbish. What Sir? Are you imagining something in here? He is in Real. He is right somewhere here? -Who? Oh! The one you killed in Hyderbad? He too came GOA along with you? I've seen him throwing this CAN. This is enough to prove him real. Excuse me. This one is also real. This is GOA Sir. Its very common to have such CAN. This CAN might be common but he's not common. He has Mongolian face with pony tail hair. He is apprearing in same pony tail hair since my childhood. Thats not his hair style but Mongolian cutom. Russian Mafia. No need to search him all around. Just GOA is enough to find him. Instead of thinking him and wasting time, you can give your interview??? One day girl friend? Interview? One day girl friend? Interview? One day girl friend... Subtitles by your RAM RAM KUMAR TAMANG That means "How am I?" in Mongolian language. Sit down. Whenever you find others, "How are you?" is asked. But I ask "How am I?" How am I? Same? Do I look exactly as you imagined? Who am I? Funny. Instead of asking who am I, you asking me who are you? You too do joke. I've seen my killing episode in TV. The anger in your eyes... Thank God... I was not there, so its ok. If not, you've killed me so brutely. Thinking that too makes me so scared. Who are my parents? Why do you killed them? I thought of killing you before you aks me that. The dash in the beach...the boat... These are not the accidents. These are my plans to kill you. But... missed. As like your childhood. This time without any plans Get ready to die from my hands... Hello Rockstar... Are you here? I'm searching you all over the market. Are you angry with me coz I sang song in your tune. What a timing your girl friend has?

RAM Subtitles by KAJI TAMANG Ram Sorry Sir. They escaped. Ok. Where will they go? Maximum there are 10 Island. Go and search. Gautam... How come we here? What happened to the yatch? Gautam What happened to your yatch? Somebody put fire in the yatch. They again attacked us. We excaped from the boat. Due to fire in that too, we came here. Who saw the men putting fire in the yatch? Its me. Who chase them? -Its me. Who cut the rope? That too is you. Do I tell you what happened? You imagined someone putting fire in the yatch. You cut the rope and made me fly in the air. After that you imagined someone chasing us. At last, you imagined boat to be in fire and came here. Mr. Gautam. We didn't came here because somebody attacked us We are here coz you imagined that. What I'm saying is true. What you are saying is not real. And me too is not real. Sameera. Sameera is not here. You are just imagining her. Thats all. Don't you know the meaning of privacy? Where ever you go and disturb us. You arrived so soon. Actually I didn't expect you to come. Its me shouting for you. Won't you talk with me? Will you just stay right here? That boat too left. Passing boats will not care about us. Fishing boats will be here tomorrow. Just stay one day in this Island. You and me. I seems your "one day girl friend" wish will be fulfilled today. Seriously. Will you accept me as your one day girl friend? But you are fictitious, right? Who said that? -You...yourself No..No.. I'm in real. Sit down. Stand up. Run in the water. That it. Whatever I'm imagining, you are doing the same. You are fictitious. No.. no..no.. I'm just doing what you're saying me to do. Exactly I thought of saying that and you did. No... If you want then say again. I'll prove me as real. Kiss me. Hug me. You are not doing as I said. That means I'm imagining that interview girl. One day girl friend will've done whatever I said. Tightly. I thought that looking at the romantic scene. Sorry. I'm imagining you. I'm fictitious. I accept that. Will you accept me as your one day girl friend? I'm so happy. I didn't thought you will express your love to me. You wantonly played with me, right? You know I'm in real, right? I know you are real. But I had to know interview girl as fictitious, right? Then what should we do? Then I've to take your interview. It that so? Ok ok. Rockstar interviewing a jorunalist. Amazing. Nice TRP item. come on. What's your name? You know that. Its interview. Sameera. What do you do? -I'm a journalist. What's your covered best news? Best news... to record your murder scene. Sorry. Recording Gautam murder news. I got famous from that. I lost my name(fame). Do Gautam has the past? -No. He's just presumming it. What else did he assume? Many things. He is imagining the interview girl too. That means interview girl is not real? -Yeah This camera says that interview girl is not fictitious. How much are they giving you? For telecasting this news. You are the first person so close to my life. I thought you loved me? It would've been good if your love was true. Don't play with me onwards. I have my past and that's the reality. No one can make it fasify. You too can't. You acted loving me. But don't act like being in pain. It would've been good if you're really fictitious. I'm the first person to believe you having your past. I searched for your past. Nearly 20 years back, Inspector Maule joined that boy here. I too don't remember properly I found alone him in the forest. He used to cry saying his parents were murdered. After inquiring, nothing like that. He is first boy to run away from our orpanage home. Thats why I remembered him. But I didn't any proof. Why I did this all, you know? He strongly believes that he has his past. He just keep on imagining only those three. Not others. We can't do anything about that. Then what can we do doctor? I'll tell you one If we can prove that he imagine other people too then we can treat him. But thats impossible. Thats impossible. No Doctor... Its possible. Thats why I acted as two people. Whatever happened between us, if that were real then how happy would I've been But in proving your reality my love, became a lie. Which I couldn't bear. So, its a recored failure love story. Whatever happened between us in real, turned to be fictional would've been good Sorry Gautam. Good Bye. Sameera... Is this real? -What happened? Is this in real or not? -Yes Gautam. So what? That means attack too is real. Gautam. Listen to me? You don't have any past. You are just presumming that. As long as you don't believe that, attacks on you keep on happening. That is what I'm saying too. That attack was not for me but for you. They are trying to kill you. -So you are imagining like that now. Car accident, boat accident, yatch attack... That too happened when you where there... What they want is you not me. Why do they want to kill me? I don't have any enemy. They woul've killed me if they wanted to. They wouldn't have left me. They are coming for you Sameera. Its not safe to stay here. Come. You know what? Real or Fictitious, thats not your problem. Untrust. You'll have believed me, if you'd loved me. I Love You. I Love You. Enough? Do you believe me now? I believe you Gautam. I Love You too. Two minutes... I'll just change my dress and come. Ram Subtitles by Mr. RAM KUMAR TAMANG KAJI TAMANG RAM What are you doing? They are my friends. Rahul, are you ok? Happy Birthday Sameera. We came to give you surprise but Gautam gave us surprise. I didn't thought they were your friends. I thought they were there to attack you. Sorry Sameera. This won't repeat again. Sameera... I'm saying Sorry. Happy Birthday Sammera. Please Gautam leave me. Just go away from here. What you said is correct Sameera. Nobody attacked you. All were my imaginations. Sameera... I'll change...Sameera. Sameera... I'll change. Who cares if you change or not? Whats the relationship between us? Sameera I Love You. Is this the reality? Do you know what you are saying real? Sameera... that is... I can't trust you Gautam. You won't change. Stop Sameera. What should I say to make you trust me? How can I make you believe me? Fine. Your past fictitious. You don't have your parents. All is that your imagination. Do you accept that? I accept that Sameera. I don't have my past nor do I've my parents. If I don't come out now from this falsity then I can't ever come out from this. In the sorrow of having no one, I pressumed them to be killed. In the fear of losing you, I'm pressuming someone trying to attack you right now too... That all is fictional. All is just created only by me. Gautam... Right now too, I'm imagining someone trying to stab knife in your neck Sameera. Look I'm not reacting anymore. They are staring at me Sameera. There are other people behind him too Sameera. I'm scared they might kill you. Look I'm not doing anything. Believe me. Look they are beating me Sameera. Yet I'm not doing anything. Whether its reality or not... I can't bear if anything happens to you Sameera. Sorry Gautam... Ram Who are you? Why are you trying to kill Sameera? Why are you trying to kill her? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me... Gautam... Leave him. I know who they are. What is that you urgently want to talk with me? Some one is trying to kill me Sir. There are attacks happening on me. Are you sure? -Yes Sir. Do you remember that? 2 months before I did a program to prove the effects of seeds from A-Jeevan's company Actually my friends who proved Hydrogen Cyanide in that seeds is a GOA's best INGOs active member. Recently when I called him when I were in GOA but he didn't answer After that, it came to news that he died in some boat accident. But before his death, he'd called me Saying A-Jeevan cheif called him to discuss about this matter. I'm the only one person to know that he went there. When he died the day after calling me, I got the doubt and inquired about the A-Jeevan chief. Correctly after that attacks are happening on me. That means that's not an accident Sir. It was a pre-plan murder Sir. Fearing about the truth coming out, he too is trying to kill me. His name is Antonio Rosarios. Its his photo Sir. Have a look. Did anyone come with you? Gautam Sir. He is waiting in the lobby outside. Do Gautam know this? -No Sir. I thought informing you 1st as this is related to the channel subjects. I lied him saying that this is due to the investigate that I did in the old city Don't tell... Not only to Gautam but to anyone. What are you saying Sir? The same person Antonio Rosarios who was a criminal in GOA Now he is a A-Jeevan Seeds company's chief, mafia king 5 minutes before, he came here. Armani Suit Ray ban glass Pony tail. cut in the face... Again he came. He is fearing that his political career might get destroy because of this. Its for the news and reporter. 50 cores for me. He said he'll let you to live. what if I go against him? You'll die and I too will die. Seynore Seynoria ("How am I"? in Mongolian langugage) Are you shocked? This is the advantages of pressuming. Every time you taking out the gun... its becoming boring. Small change... How is it? Sit down. Right now I'm not pressumig any chair for you. Sit down. Fictitious I know you are not in real. Sameera told me that. She proved that I don't have any past. My past is falsity means you too is not real, right? Shhhh... don't talk. Stay calm. I'll believe you to be real if you talk. I only talk. But Sameera don't like talking with you in my imagination. She has started believing me thinking I'm changing. For her to believe that I totally has changed then I've to stop pressuming you. I've to kill you. Doctor gave me this tablets. Said you'll disappear if I take this. that I won't see you again. But I feel pain if you dissappear. You are here means my parents too were there. I'll have my past. If you are not then I'll become orphan. It would've been good if you were real. But you are not... Just die. You don't know why I'm trying to kill you, right? Then I've to tell you my story. 20 years back in GOA It says me with my parents travelling in the bus. Story says three villians came. One them, it says you were the one. Says you killed my parents. Says I ran from there. Till then, story says you have been trying to kill me Before I come and kill you, you want to kill me, Says my story. This is my story. Revenge Story. How is it? This all is not necessary for us. Doctor says, if take this tablets, you'll disapper. What I say is, before taking this tablets, I want to kill you by this bullets. Revenge Story, Right? It would get the commercial ending. What do you say? Why are you taking the breath? You are not alive coz you are breathing. You are alive coz I'm imagining you. Ok. Last choice? Do you want to say anything? Its ok, you can tell. I'm giving you the permission. Tell me. I'm in real. I'm Real. That what I'm saying to everyone but nobody is believing me. Anyway you believed that you are Real. What happened? I heard some sound. I Killed him. I killed that pony tail. Now he'll not dare to come in my dream. Sond shouldn't have come? Is he in reality? Sameera is he in reality? Is he in reality? Sameera is he in reality? He is real Sameera. If he is real means I've my past Sameera. I do had my parents Sameera.

Now remaining is yours revenge. But one thing before killing. Why did you kill Michael? -Who is Michael, Boss? That means you didn't kill Michael? Why do I kill him? That means you didn't come to bank? That means you don't want the box? Pick up the phone. 20 years back, what's your father's occupation in Goa? Taxi driver. Where are you from Sir? -London. London is my dream Sir. Follow that bus. Ok Sir. Kill him too. Don't kill him Sir. he is just a kid. You need Visa. You need Vis, right? He wants Visa, right? Who told you that I killed your father? That day in the concert, my father met his old friend. You are always my boss. Come Sir. He too was in the car when you followed my father. I started a new bussiness. He saw you creating trouble with my father. 20 years back. In Goa. You were with other two. He said that you killed my father. Why you killed them? I'm not the one who killed your father. your father's old friend. Due to the SINTO-1 company, sides effects are seen Land is polluting and many are dying. This is not the problem. Climate temperature is increasing. Fertile lands are turning to infertile. In many countries there is the scarcity of foods. World is going to face a big food crisis problems. Golden rice with C4 mechanism. whatever the climate, it can grow massively. The property that can fullfill the world's need. That property is invented by SINTO-1. From now onwards, every types of countries(rich or poor,having food crisis) have to beg before SINTO-1 for the food. Sir, Gautam knew the truth. RAM He can't kill me nither do I. My Golden rice is with him and I've his past with me. We need eachother. Your father and I was Co-Scientists in same company. Not only that but a good friends. Your father always used to think about the welfare of peoples and farmers He wanted to do something for them. After that we started this SINTO-1 seeds hybrid company. But your father involved in preparing golden seed in a traditional way. which I said impossible. Suddenly he came to the lab to test the seeds. I got surprised seeing the results. That was Golden Rice. Cores and cores of money was invested in the project whose result was in you father's hand. I said him to give it for the company. He said no and wanted to give people freely. For that he went to the Goa International Rice Convention. I thought of getting seeds killing your father. Joining Antonio there, I killed your parents. After that I found, the seeds your father gave me was of no use. There he put the terminator gene. We got the information that he hided seeds somewhere and put its locations secretly in the Rubik's cube from the cab driver. your father wants you to have that Rubik's means you know about finding the clue. I sent my people behind you. But you were too clever. You ran from there. The magic that father hided 20 years back, now son has got that. I got doubt when the bullet that killed Michael didn't wanted to kill me the one whom I'm searching is expecting something from me. At that time I got the clue and went to bank. In bank, I found the box that my father hided. But there was no seed in the box. Whats that there is no seed in the box? There must be seed. There should also be the details of my father in your story. I know that you are eagarly waiting to know about your parents. Your father's name is Raghu Ram. This is not original golden rice. My father name is also not Raghu Ram. How can you say that? You won't kill me untill and unless I say the truths about your parents. That means that file is not real. Tell me where is seed? I'll tell truths about your parents. Finally what I understood is you won't tell me until I give you the seed. I won't give you seed until you tell me about my parents. The other truth that you and I know is As soon as I give you seed, you'll kill me. I too will kill you as soon as you tell me the truths. Never Ending Process. There is only one solution for this one of us has to compromise. I'll compromise. I don't need my past. Means? -I'll kill you. Gautam I'm the only one to know about your parents. If you kill me then there won't be your any past. If I don't kill you then my fathers wish will not come true. Till now I thought knowing my parents was my life Now I decided to fulfill my fathers wish is correct for me. Your father's name is Krishna Murthy. He is a Scientist from Philipines. Ravindra. Your father's name is Ravindra. He used to work in Texas. not Krishna Murthy. I'l listen whatever the stories you tell. Coz in there is my parents in every stories. You'd killed him in every story. The end of story is always same that I'll kill you. You won't kill me. If you wanted then you'll shot here and not in other places. You won't me. you want your past about your parents. You won't kill me. Its not new for me to kill you. I have killed you many times. I know what happens when you die. But you don't know what happens when I kill you. That's true. What you said is correct. I can't kill you. I want my parents. I want to know who they are. I just remember my mother feeding me. I remember sitting in my fathers lap. Suddenly they said I had no parents. All was fictitious. I cried. Till now I kept on crying. Tell me who were my parents. At least tell me how they look? How does my mother looked like? How does my father looked like? Do he looked like me? You had seen them, right? Tell me please. Tell me something please. Ok. I'll tell. First lets go to hospital, ok? I'm dying. You'll always be keep on crying if I die. I'll tell every damn thing. Every damn thing. Where is... Golden Rice? Where is it? I'm sorry for everything Boss. You are the ONE. You'll always be ONE for me. Sorry Dudu. I've only one pain. You are returning without knowing your parents. It would be good if you'd known them. Stop the car. What dear? Do you forgot the way to your house? I'll sing you a song for you. Then you won't forget your way. Ok? Bye bye bye to the Peter's statue. Hi to the white swan in the river. There's the road in between the trees. Run Run Run In the field, there's tower. Its so high. There's a bridge in the way. Fly Fly Fly Then comes beautiful fields. Green Green Green Ram I'm coming mom. Gautam? -I'm coming father Gautam? -Coming. We are civilized. We are mordernized. We are globalized. Civilization is a great failure. People dying of hunger. Every 3 of seconds, human being is dying of hunger. A man thought no one should die of hunger. He was not a farmer, not a biologist and not a scientist. In the desire to fulfilling the hunger of every people It made him a biologist, a farmer and a scientist. At every cost of fullfilling his wish He kept on trying continuously. On the verge of trying, he lost his life. But he achieved what he has dreamed for. The Golden Rice. A Second Green Revolution. From now onwards, no people will die of hunger. Today his dream is fulfilled. His name is Chandra Shekhar. He is my Father. Thank you everyone for watching the movie. Subtitles By Mr.NAGA BABU
