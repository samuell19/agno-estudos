- Again the convict ship has arrived from England, bearing nearly 300 prisoners. As Governor of this colony, l protest against this law that subjects the free people of my country to the burden and presence of criminals. - Friendly lot of heathens aren't they? - What did you expect? Flowers? - Guards and prisoners halt! -Well l made it Michael. Here l am alive on solid ground again. - Sure, Coughy me boy, l told you you'd make it. And now in this land of sunshine, you'll live to be a fine old man. - No Michael, the doctor's know. l'll only last a few months. - Ah, get along with ya. -Well l'll see more in six months, than most men see in a life time, Michael. lt's funny, life gets ashamed of cutting you short l guess. Opens your eyes to beauties you've never seen before. - Guards and prisoners, forward march. - Oh how do you do? - Oh look father, that must be the new style. - Things like that are not for a country girl. Jeanette. - Oh. Oh, yes father. - Number 39, Roger Bradford. Raise your right hand. You have been sentenced to five years penal duty by Her Maiesty's government. l hereby as sign you into the custody of Arnold Trist, a free citizen. -Well Mr. Trist, you'll get very little work out of that one. - On the other hand Mr. Smithers, l shan_ waste on food on him. - Prisoner Sidney Tullman step forward. - Bound over to Arnold Trist, free citizen. - Sentenced to seven years penal servitude. - John Cars grave. - 43. - Prisoner Benjamin Blackie step forward. - Bound over to John Conway, a free citizen. - Sentenced to 14 years Penal servitude. - Daniel Penny. - Number41, Michael Fury, raise your right hand. You are here by as signed into the custody of the honorable Arnold Trist. - Miss Dupre, your father's spent a nice sum on his supplies and l'd like to give you this little present, to take back with you to the valley. - Oh. - By the sweat of thy brow shall though eat bread. - Oh l forgot. l'm sorry l can't accept this. - l don't understand. - We are Ammonites, we take nothing for which we do not labor. You may take it Jeanette, but l must pay for it. - Oh l'm sorry, no offense. - l know, l know. - You made a quick trip sir, we didn't expect you so soon. - l knocked a couple of hours off the last trip. And with some more of the whip we could've beaten that. - Well the old mans back. - Yes. l'll have to shake things up a bit. - What happened while l was away? - Some of the men refused to work sir, said they were sick. - You cured them l hope. - Oh yes. A week in the cells with bread and water. - And very little bread. - Yes sir. Oh yes sir, one of the men struck a guard. - And so? - l gave him a dozen lashes sir. - A dozen? You're getting soft Preston. - l'm sorry sir. - What about the settlers in the valley? - We've used every means within the law to harass them sir, but so far they won't leave. -What do mean within the law? Here l'm the law, that land out there is mine, it's going to be mine. Those people can't interfere with me or my plans. An empire within an empire. From range to range. l'm Arnold Trist, l'm not anybody else. - Yes sir. - It's a long from England and a longer way back. Beyond those hills it's further still. l wouldn't entertain any thought of escape gentleman, every settler between here and Sydney has a gun loaded to pick up escaped convicts. For the return of which l pay a hundred pound alive or dead. You were sent here to work, that you will do. This is the back country, the laws are our laws. Alright Christian, have their chains removed. - Come on, move along. ln the corner you'll find bowls and spoon. Take one of each. Go to the window and your bowl will be filled with food. That's all. - l'm gonna be looking over the new fish, and give 'em a piece of me mind, so they know who the head man is around here. - Me too. - Ah, so these are the new ones are they? Well l'm just looking you over boys. l thought maybe l could give you a lesson or two in the etiquette of this establishment here. Sure they're a crummy lot. Look at them. l never would believe miracles could happen. Well, well, well. lt's him boys. Sure as l'm standing here. Captain Fury they callt him. Liberator of Ireland, riding along in the country side on his fine horse, with a couple of pistols strapped to his waist. The finest shot in the whole of Ireland they say. Stand up for your rights says he. Now look at him, look at him. Where's your fine gestures now? Here he i, in this rotten hole. Eating the same muck and wearing the same prison clothes... ...like you and me. - Captain Fury's a fine man. -Who's asking for the opinion of the likes of you? The back of my hand to ya. - Don't ever do that again. - Oh, l see. Channeling your high floating ideas in here are ya? l want you to get this once and for all, l'm the head man here. Let the best of ya stand up in front of me. And l'll smack ya down so fast that you'll understand what l'm talking about. Well what do ya say? Come on you bugger legged, knock kneed polecats, stand up will ya. -When a man calls me a polecat. - Keep your place Coughy. There's no doubt you're a better man with your fists than l am, but l suppose there'll be no peace 'til you've proved it, so l'll stand up to you. - Oh, he will, will he? - Keep your left up laddy. - Billings, how am l doing buddy? - Not so good, he's getting up. - Break it up! Come on! Break it up over there. Back to your places all of you! What's going on here? - Just a little playful amusement, you won't be begrudge us that are such a hard days work would ya? - l'll have the whip enforced to the first one of you that makes a sound. - Ah me lad. lt's been many a day since a man stood up against me so well. - l thought l was gone for sure though, the second time you downed me. - Sure and that punch on the jaw you gave me was like a kick from a mule. For a time l could see two of yous. Oh. Gentleman. Maybe l don't agree with his high floating ideas, and maybe you can make a sows ears out of a silk purse. But he's a man that Captain Fury and as such he'll be treated as one. - Now there's a work of art. - About the settlers in the valley, l'm going to give them one more chance to get out of there. ln the morning Mergon you'll take your men and round all the settler's up and l'll meet them in front of the Dupre cabin. lmpress on them, the importance of being there. You can be impressive can't you? - Oh yes sir. - What on earth? - Well, l'm sure l don't know sir. - It seems we have a humorist in our midst, a practical joker. lnstead of doing his work as described by law, he wastes his time working out artistic designs on sheep. Well we also have a humorous way of dealing with such conduct. The man responsible step forward. You were in the shearing shed. Who was it? - l don't know, l was busy with the sheep all day. And l can assure you l had me back turned to him all the time. - See if six lashes will loosen his tongue. - But l wouldn't know a thing like that Governor. l Wouldn't l tell ya. - You needn't go any further, l'm the one. - Come here. So you're the one. Take our comical friend here and double the dose. - Nobodies every hit me with a whip. And nobody ever will. Tell your men to stand back! Or l'll drive these shears clean through you. - Al right men stand back. Don't waste your powder. Larkin you're the best shot, take your time and get him when he goes over the wall. - Yes sir. - Better go to the office. - Shall l take after him sir. - No. When he goes after food, the settlers will pick him up for the reward. And then what l do to him, will be quite delightful. - Put up your hands. -What for? - Because you're my prisoner. - l'd rather be a prisoner of yours than of lots of people l can think of. - Quiet and come out of there. - Would you mind turning around and giving me chance to make my self a bit presentable? - l should think you would. -What do you want to capture me for? - Because you're an escaped convict and l get a hundred pounds for your return. - Oh my a hundred pounds. l must be a very important convict. - Any escaped convict is worth a hundred pounds. - Alright m'lady, at your service. Oh. l could've escaped you know. - And me with a gun? - And you with your back turned? - Then why didn't you? -Well, to tell you the truth l'm hungry. haven't had a bite since yesterday and that was nothing to be grateful for. - Are you really hungry? - Oh, if you were to take me and give me a bite to eat, l'd be a much happier prisoner. And you would have a much clearer conscience. - Alright, but one false move out of you and... - l'll be as gentle as a lamb and what l don't know about lambs now would surprise you. - Go ahead. - Morecambe, Trist once you at the cross roads and don't waste any time about it. -What's he want to see me for? - Don't talk back, get along with you. - Alright come along, we haven't got all day. - Mr. Trist wants to talk to you settlers. - Mr. Bailey. Mr. Trist would like to talk to you. - And l'd be very pleased to see Mr. Trist. lt's about time somebody talked to him about what's going on in this valley. - But if things are as bad in the valley as you're telling me, why would you be wanting to turn me back to Trist? - And why not? You're an escaped convict, aren't you? - But he's your enemy. - Which has nothing to do with you. - There's something inside me that l'm thinking, so l'll be asking your pardon because it's got to come out. lf l'd seen you driving down Sackville Street in Dublin in a flying carriage with a beautiful gun, l'd have said ''there goes one of the loveliest Iadies in all of Ireland.'' But to see you know in front of this fire. And after me being months in the hold of a convict ship, you're like a beautiful morning rose, clinging to the walls of a country garden. - Those beasts. Well l'll show them. - Wait. Wait. There's a lot more there than you could handle with one gun. Suppoing we wait and see what happens. - What l have to say to you won't take me long. l'm trying to convince you in a nice way that you don't belong here. Now l'm going to tell you what will happen if you don't leave. l'll give you one week, no longer. lf you're not gone by then, l shouldn't be surprised if your live stock disappeared, your cabins were burned to the ground, this land is all mine. Mine, do you hear. And if you don't get out the consequences will be on your own heads. Alright back to the station. - You heard what he said. What can we do? We can't go anywhere. - What about our families? - That's right our children. lf something should happen to them. - Dupre. Now you've said nothing. What do you think? - Men get nowhere fighting fate with their fists. Go home, take care of your own affairs. lf it's pre-destined that we suffer, then it shall be so. -Wait a minute! You can't run away now. lf you do we're beaten. We've got to stay together. You who have wives and children, do you want them to suffer? - Here, here. - A convict! - Who are you? - l'm a convict yes, but l'm this young ladies prisoner. - We want none of your kind around here. - Oh yes you do. l'm going to help you. -With what? - With your problem. The young ladies right, a man who wouldn't fight for his home is a rat. - l didn't say that. - You implied it. Why, what's the matter with you all? You've been given land by a good government. A young government that is still unable to offer you the right kind of protection. But you're pioneers. You are the government and you've got to fight for what is honorably yours. - You talk big convict, but we're match for Trist. - And he's given us only a week. - l ask you not to listen to this man. - But you're not doing this for your selves, you're doing it for your children. Don't you want them to have a future? - We can't fight back. He'd destroy the lot of us. - Help me to release some of my friends and we'll fight your battle for you. - l expected that. He's asking freedom for himself and his men, not for us. You can't do that Mr. Bailey. Why, l'd rather seen us lose than- - Than what? - Than ask help from a pack of criminals. - Oh thank you. So l suppose you'd rather be taking me back to collect your reward? - Men, you're wishing a curse upon your selves. Even if you win, your association with this convict will put you on the wrong side. When the law comes, you will be no better than he is. l'll have none of it. Come with me Jeanette. - What do you need convict? - A good horse beneath me and a gun to defend my self with. - Well, what do you think? - Here, who are you? - Bob, Bob, Suko wake up, wake up. Coughy come on. l've come back because l need your help, to do something worth while on the outside. Maybe we'll all get the noose at the end of it, but at least we'll be together in a band. - Band. - Will you join me? - Of course we will, eh Suko. - You mean we'll get popped at and things. - That's right and who cares. - You take me, with my cough? - Of course. - And me too? - Ah, l'm afraid it's not what you think it is Blackie. We're going out to help honest people. - Sure, 8ure l know. Why l wouldn't miss the chance for nothing. -Well, alright. But remember this, you'll take orders or out you go. - That l will Captain Fury. Why, l was for you the moment l seen ya. And what about Bertie? - Ooh, l'm afraid he's too small. - What? Put 'em up and show him what you can do. Why he was the bantamweight champion of London for three years. - Alright Bertie, alright come on. Suko and Bertie get the horses. Follow me Bob. Put your hands up and come on out of there. Come on line up, line up. Now we'll take them over to the pay office. - Pay office? -Well that's where they keep the money isn't it? - Now ain't you the smart one. Come on over to the pay office then, come on. - Come along storekeeper and bring your keys with you. Watch this side Coughy. Come on, come on. Come on, over the against the wall, keep an eye on them. - Yes sir. - Now open the safe. We're here to collect the money that Trist owes the settlers. Come on, open it. - Ah look at the stars my friend, are they not beautiful? - 340 pounds, you count it out. - Do you remember the time when you stuck your gun in my ribs? Well, here's for that. Quiet, quiet. Alright quiet, l'll keep him quiet. - Hurry up, hurry up. - 340 pounds is a lot of money. - Well if you ask me, you're getting off lightly. - Do you remember the time when you hit me on the back of the neck with a whip? Well, that's for that. Quiet l tell ya, quiet. l'll look after him, l'll take care of it. - Now you'll sign this paper and there'll be no doubt about what l took the money for. Put it back Blackie. Alright, we're off. - That's for nothing. - And that's for something. - Alright, on your horses. - To all the settlers huh? And you let him take it, you miserable muddling fool. You ought to be horse whipped. A fine pack of idiots, all of you. For the settler's, huh? What does he know about the settler's, unless they've been protecting him? Protecting him, now that would be interesting, very interesting. Get out! Get out of here, you weak kneed sniveling swine. -Was sure cute, what you said you was going to do with the money. Give it to the settler's. - It was the truth. - It was so. lt was what? - You fella's get a pound a piece, the rest of the money goes to the settler's. - You mean you're not gonna divide it? - No. - But it's our money, we snatched it didn't we? - You heard what l said. - Well of all the, l. - What did he say? - Ah, he said what he said, that's what he said. -Well there's no need to get angry Blackie. Suko's only asking. - A hundred pounds apiece, that's a lot of money. - Yeah, but we ain't gonna get it. -We ain't getting it? - Say what's coming off here? - Well he knows what he's gonna do. Of that he's certain. l think he does. Sure he's gonna give the money back to the settler's. Make good with them and be friendly. And when it comes to the big haul, well that's what he's gonna do, that is l think he's gonna do that. - It's filled with gold. - Ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous nonsense. That sort of thing belongs with the past, it's unbelievable. - But Your Excellency, it is true. For several days past, word has reached us that this band of escaped convicts has been running wild Malopi Valley. - Malopi Valley, huh. Arnold Trist's region. Send him a letter post haste, he should be able to give me first hand information. - Yes sir. - Are we gonna stick around all the time like this? l'm sick of it. - Me too. - You keep your nose out of this. What's the matter with ya? Been reading fairy tales or something? Mr. Bailey, the least trouble will you send up a smoke signal. What sort of monkey of a business is that? l'm sick of it. - You've said that before. - Yes and l mean it. And if we didn't get a signal pretty soon l'll-- - You'll what? -Well, l'll what's the sense of staying around here doing nothing? - There'll be plenty to do when the time comes. - Plenty to do when the time comes. Plenty to do with the time comes, ha. - Yesterday was the last day given the settler's to get out. None of them has gone, as yet. But they will and oh how they will. You'll give them a little fireworks and we might start with Mr. Bailey. - Thank you sir. - You've had your warning, now you're gonna get out. - This is our home. - Yes, it was. See if that cupboard real will you Stolley? Heck, come on. Throw this other. - Yeah, but what about this food? lt smells good. - Yeah. That's an idea. Come on, draw up men. Tea Bailey and speed it up. - Pour the tea mother. l'll go out and get some eggs. - Come on, come on. - Fetch fast too. - Danny? Never mind. Dirty cowards. - Signal! - That's what l've been waiting for. - Suco get the muskets, come on. Coughy, don't you think you better stay behind? - Huh? There's things going on. - Bailey's place! - To Bailey's. - Ah, go, come on. - Hey, hey, hey hey. - Don't move. - What? Why you? - Up against the wall. - He's not feeling very well. - Yeah. Come on, line 'em up against the shed. Now, in future all damage will be paid for. No doubt Mr. Trist will be only too glad to reimburse you. So come along, we'll take up a collection. - Aye, that's a fine idea. And you put it right in the palm of my head. Come on. - If it's all the same to you Blackie, we'll let Bob take up the collection. - Captain Fury, if you think after what you said to me that l would do a thing like that, then l, Well, well. - alright Blackie, see they put everything back where they found it. Bob, Coughy come on. - l hear that. l will lads. - Shut up, shut up! Get this woman out of here. Outside. - Nothing wrong with crying mother. - l didn't think anybody could be so cruel. - Hands up Mergon. -What's this? -Just a little bit of your own medicine. - Oh Captain Fury, they're gonna burn down our house. - Oh no they're not. Coughy, do you think you could find Mr. Mergon a bit of really dirty work to do? - l think l have just the job for him Michael, come on. - Bob. - Mr. Bailey. Alright keep 'em up. - Good job for you. Pig pen mender. - You put everything back to this young lady's satisfaction. Start moving. My names Bob, Bob Tannington. - Mine's Bailey, Tess Bailey. - Tess? Well l once had a girl by the name of Tess. l mean, l once knew a girl by the name of Tess. -Just look at those beautiful clouds. -What's beautiful about 'em? -What's beautiful about 'em? Maybe you ought to be closer to the earth, so you can appreciate 'em better. Now look up at 'em, they must be beautiful from there. - Ah, they're all doing fine work Captain Fury. The fence is up and the cabbages are back in the field and Coughy's doing a fine work in the, in the pig pen. And the cows have been put back in the shed, and the trough has been put back and everything's going along fine, chickens, the barn, you could eat out of the-- - Well the criminals are hard at work and l hope to your satisfaction. - Oh Captain Fury, your men are wonderful. - Oh aye, the men are fine. But, will you not be including me in your compliment? - Oh well you too, and l'm sorry for the opinion l had about you. - And what was that? - Well, l didn't think you really meant to help the settler's. - Come on fencer, come on. Come on pig pen, come on barner, come on you. Out of the house there. - Alright come on outside. - Now what will we do with them Michael? - Well well, who could this be? -Why it's Mergon, the top boss. - Oh aye so it is. Well Mergon you can take your men and go. And don't forget we may not be so good natured next time. - There'll be other times Fury. And one of these days you'll hang for this. - Oh Captain Fury, it was happy day for this valley, when you took it upon yourself to help us. l could kiss you for what you've done this day. Couldn't you my dear. - l wish there was some way that l could reward you gentleman. -Well l-- - l know. l could treat you down at the inn. - What's that? - The inn down the road? - Aye, that's just what l thought he said. Why l haven't wet my whistle since l was nabbed four years ago. lt's a grand idea sir. Can we go out to play teacher? -Well, if you're back by bed time. - Now John you'll be careful and come home amiably. - Don't worry mother, we'll be very careful. - Alright. - Come on boys, let get the horses. - l mean to say-- - You have to be a little quiet. - Hey, quiet, quiet. - Can l have a little service in the back room? - l think so. And who are these men may l ask? - They're friends of mine. - It's a bit irregular. l might be able to serve the settler's in here, but not you crummy blokes. - Hey. l want you to know, we're the finest people in the community and you'll serve us with whatever we ask you too. And if you open your trap, we'll skin you alive and feed you to the crows. Now six pots of Stringy Bark and be with it. - Yes sir, six pots of Stringy Bark righto 8ir. Rolling chain. The rolling chain Chain Chain - Miss, it's Jerry Black. l'd like to speak to you a minute. Boys.

Do you know what Coughy says about it? - Coughy? - A saint with the pain of death in his heart. He says it's all the goodness in the world spinning on a silver platter. And if only you're willing to look up to it, you can always catch some of the spinnings. - You're really serious inside, aren't you? - Now what are we talking about? The moon or me? - The people of this valley pray for you Michael. - l'll do my best. - l know you will, you're the kind that doe8. Oh l'm glad l know you Michael. - Jeanette. - Father! - Go back to the house and on your knees pray for forgiveness. - Please father. - Do as l have told you.

Right here. You go there. Keep your eyes open. l'm really sorry Miss Dupre, l hope you won't hold it against me. After it's all over, you may need a friend and l thought perhaps, where are you going? - Why, l was just going outside to shake out the crumbs? - Let me do that for you. - The signal, the smoke signal, where's Fury? - Down in the valley. - Well what are we gonna do? - What are we gonna do? Why l'm in command now. To your horses men. - It might pay you- - Hey boss. Here they come. - Michael! - Shut up. - Up to your old tricks again eh? -Where's Fury? - We don't need Fury to take care of the likes of you. Give me that gun. - Not so fast. - Throw up your hands. Drop them guns. - Alright. Bring 'em into here. Come on get inside. Get those horses out of 8ight and go back to your places men. Fury will be here any minute now. You two men go inside and keep them quiet. - What is happening? Where's my daughter? What happened to her? - Oh shut up. - l'm in command now. To your horses men. - Now go to the back door. Tell one of your men to bring Blackie in. Say you want to question him, go on. - Friend. Bring Blackie over here. l wanna question him. - Blackie? Yes sir. - Sit down over there. - Captain! Well, well, well. - Hello Blackie. Keep an eye on them. - That l will. - Oh Michael, this is good of you. - Don't you worry. They'll do you no harm this day. - Come on, come on hurry up. Move, move. - Alright Mergon. - Fury. - Call your lads together and get 'em back to the station, l don't wanna get any of them hurt. - Come on you men, hurry up. - Alright lads get 'em to work. Alright Blackie, get 'em out and put 'em to work. - Alright. Come on, get out of here. He won't make much good to me. Get to work will ya. - Come on now, wait a minute, wait a minute. l've got a proposition to make to you fella's. - Well what is it? - Let me arrange a meeting with Mr. Trist. You come away with your pockets jingling with his money. - Oh, so you want us to meet Mr. Trist do ya? - Yes and if you fella's are wise, you'll drop in. - Well he said drop in. - That's what he said. - Wouldn't that be a lovely scene done in pastilles? - You wait 'til Trist here's about this. - Why Mr. Preston, you haven't answered my question. l'm ashamed of you. - The service you rendered, doesn't entitle you to the hospitality of my home. You and your men shall be amply paid for what you have done. -What do you mean? - Please Michael. - A pound a piece l imagine would be fair. - Mr. Dupre, we're not asking for pay. - Nor l for charity. - Please Michael take it. - Now you've been paid and are no longer obligated. Get out. - Oh father how could you do such a thing? - l want nothing to do with him or his kind. -Well what do you think about it now? - Looks beautiful. - What's beautiful? - Everything's beautiful. The mountains are beautiful, the trees are beautiful, the grass is beautiful, everything's beautiful. - Ah, you're barmy. - Here you are Blackie. - And what is this? - We're so successful now, we're getting paid for our effort. - Aye, things are looking up a bit. -Well l'm telling you this. That Captain Fury is taking the whole of the interior. - Go on in there and tell 'em they can have the sheep will ya, go on. - Put that gun down. - l tell you the government must do something about this Captain Fury. - Military forces should be dispatched at once sir. - Not only shall the military forces be dispatched, but it's time l visited the back country myself. but it's time l visited the back country myself. - l still insist that it's preposterous for you, the most important person in the colony to travel through this everlasting dust just to hang one man. - Hanging is also important Hamilton. Especially to the man who's being hanged. -Well they should hang him in the first place and be done with it. - Boys l have news for you. The settler's are so happy that they haven't been bothered lately, that they're having a dance tonight at the Bailey barn. And we're all invited. - Me too? - Wonderful. - Oh and Michael, Miss Dupre has received permission from her father to spend the evening at the Bailey's. - Ah, did she now? - What l say is, women have no place in the lives of men of the likes of us. We'd be mooning around and getting soft and careless until one of them Trist boogeymen will come along and jump all over you. - Oh your just jealous Blackie, because Mike and Bob have the two best looking girls in the valley. - No mind Blackie, you can probably dance all night with Grandma Kerrigan and some of the other nice old ladies. - ls that so? - Well come on Blackie. We've got a call to make before the dance this evening. - Oh right you are, right you are. -Well you've no idea what we're up against. What fiends thee fellows are. - And he always takes a cowardly vantage and shows up in the most unexpected places. - And some day Mr. Trist, l'm gonna meet this Fury face to face in a fair fight and when l do. - Good evening gentleman. l hope there's a place for me. - Little informal aren't you? - Ah, this reminds me of the days when l was in your employ Mr. Trist. May l? And could l trouble you for the potatoes. A night ride makes one so hungry, don't you think Mr. Preston, or do you? Gravy. Excellent food Mr. Trist, excellent. Thank you. l have lived so long alone, that a comment from a connoisseur is very welcome. You're planning to stay in this county for some time l take it? - Well that all depends. There's a certain business matter that has to be cleared up. May l trouble you? And the man l have to deal with is a hard man to convince. However, l hope to bring the matter to a successful conclusion. - Out here, you'll find that to meddle in other people's affairs is a very dangerous business. l shouldn't be surprised if you left sooner than you expected. - Drop that gun or l'll kill ya. - Alright, l'll take the pistol. Ah, a beautiful weapon Mr. Trist. - Made to my order by Cooper of Liverpool. - Ah. Blackie will you put it on the mantelpiece. Would you like a piece of pheasant Blackie? - Pheasant? Why l've never tasted pheasant in me life. -Well think of that now. ln this day and age. - Aye. - You had your heroics, now what do you want of me? - l'll tell you Mr. Trist. There's many things been happening since l left your employ. The settler's are happy, their crops and their livestock are doing well. And from now on, that's the way it's going to be. lf not, l wouldn't be surprised if your livestock were to disappear and even if your house were to be burning down, the consequences now would be on your own head. So good night Mr. Trist and pleasant dreams. Put it back Blackie. - Oh my dear, you look just like Cinderella. - Ooh it's beautiful Mrs. Bailey. - Oh l borrowed it for you from Mrs. Wycrof, it was her wedding frock. - Now, show me about the dance again. Oh li do di diddledi di do de - That's it! Oh li do di oh li di de da deda - Well l'm glad to see you Mr. Blackie, l was frightened you weren't coming. - l'm glad to see you Mrs. Bailey. - And l'm real glad to see you too my dear. - Oh thank you. - Here we go now folks, start up the dance. Here we go, start the music boys. - Bob, tell me about that other girl. - Bob, tell me about that other girl. The one you knew before you came here called Tes. - Oh Michael, you don't know how good this is. lt was lonesome in the valley. We haven't many friends, but now to have you here and to be with you some times. - dear, you must get such ideas out of your sweet little head. Don't you forget l'm an escaped convict, that don't even count on tomorrow. Ah beautiful things like you are not for the likes of me. Sojust let's sit here and listen to the music and look at the night and hope tomorrow never comes. - Tess, how did you make him kiss you? - l didn't. l kissed him. - Oh. - And just what are you up to now? - Oh, nothing. - l think we better go back to the dance. - Alright. - Let him alone Blackie. - He meant to kill ya. - That's mine to deal with. - Oh father, why did you have to come here? - You call your selves upright people, the shadow of Satan is in your midst. And you take him to your bosom. - Listen you lopsided kangaroo, you can talk to these goody goodies if you like, but if l was them l'd take you and chuck you in the fire and roast you like a snake in a log, you blithering old stinky bee. - Please. Go home now. - Hey, you should've let me kick him. Then we wouldn't have had to stop the dance. - Oh Blackie, l think you're terrible. You never let me dance with nobody. - Well, when l'm in love, l'm in love and nobodies gonna-- - But you told me you never loved nobody but me. - There you go changing the subiect again. Accusing me of infidelity. And here l'm spending my hard earned money on yous. Why, look at this. - Blackie, for me? - lsn't that beautiful? Yes, but what am l gonna get for it? - Oh Blackie. - Goodnight me little sweet potato. - Goodnight me prince charming. - Jeanette? And there's only one entrance. Just above the stream overlooking the valley. - And we'll find Fury's men there as well? - l'm certain of it. Well, l'll go now. - Don't be too hasty Dupre. One can never be too certain. - But l've told you everything, there is no reason why- - Put him in one of the cells, we'll keep him there until we've caught Captain Fury. - l do not lie, l told you the truth. Let me go! Let me go! You have no right to do this to me. - Preston come with me. - Yes sir. - Please let me out of here, l'll give you money. - What would a settler like you be doing with money? - Oh l have money, l have a lot of money. l'll give you a hundred pounds if you'll only let me out of here. - A hundred pounds? - Yes. - Where have you got a hundred pounds? - l have it in my cabin. Please take me with you, l'll show it to you. - In financial affairs, l always work alone. Thanks for the information. - Blackie, l. What have you got there? - Oh nothing, nothing. Just little four leaf clovers and stuff. - Let me see that box. -Well l'm telling you little butterflies and little moonstones. - Bad stuff huh? - Oh well what if l did? We ain't no angels are we? - Blackie, l hate to tell you what l think of you. - Oh, you do, do ya. Well it's no worse than stealing money is it? You stole money didn't ya? And what do you call yourself? - l took it to give it back to the people it belonged to. There's a great deal of difference Blackie. What you're doing is to jeopardize our whole plan. -Jeopardize our plan? Huh. l like that. lt wasn't my plan to come out here to help a lot of fly swatting farmers l tell you that. lf you'd listened to me we'd have been out of this cesspool of stupidity and away with a pocket ful of gold buttons. - ls that all you got to say? - No it ain't. When are we gonna pull the big job? Our job. The job that counts. -We're not. - Oh l see, you mean you're not. Well then count me out, l'm finished. -Very well, if that's the way you feel about it, l'm not stopping you. -What's up Blackie? - l'm getting of here. l'm through with Captain Fury forever. - You're gonna take me with ya, ain't you Blackie? - Sure l will. But there's a job l gotta do by myself tonight and l'll meet you at the inn in the morning. - Michael. There's a young lady here to see you. - Young lady to see-- - Hello Michael. -Jeanette, what in the world are you doing here? - Well, aren't you glad to see me? - Of course l'm glad to see you. But at this time of night. These walls are no protection. Sooner or later a bullet will find each one of us. lt's me they're after, if l make a run for it they'll follow me, and then the rest of you will have a chance. - They'll kill you. You wouldn't get a yard beyond the door. -Well l'm gonna have a try. At least l can draw their fire away from the house, and when l do, l want you to get the girl out of here. What about you Blackie? - You look after yourself. l'm on me own. - As you like. - Alright out you get. - Are you sure he's alright? - Sure he's alright, let's go. - That's Fury. After him you fools. lf you let him get away, you'll answer to me. After him men. - Alright. Better make sure nobodies left in the cabin. - You can't kill me Trist. - Mr. Dupre. l'm saying good morning to ya. - So you're helping the settler's are you? l'll relieve you of that. -Why you. - Throw him in one of the cells. l'll talk to him later. - Mr. Trist, a messenger came in this evening and said the Governor and his retinue will arrive here late tonight. - The Governor? But l didn't expect. Get the guns out of sight, get rid of the whipping post, everything, clean up the place, understand? - Yes sir. - Why John, it's a fire! Oh it must be the Dupre's. - It is the Dupre's. - Oh the poor souls. - It's the Dupre's. - Great pleasure Your Excellency. A most delightful surprise. - How do you do Mr. Trist. l must apologize for arriving at this unseemly hour, but something must be done about this Michael Fury. - Ah then l have some good news for you sir. My men had a brush with Fury only a few hours ago, we have succeeded in breaking up his band and we expect to capture Fury himself at any moment. - But he's still at large? - Mrs. Bailey what happened? - There, there my dear. - We removed your father as soon as we could. - Father? father. - Trist. We saw the fire from our window. We found Dupre's body there, burned beyond all recognition. - Empty. We can't blame Trist this time Mr. Bailey. - No? Then what could have happened? - Blackie did it. There's no doubt about it. - Why Blackie? - He killed him for his money. - Blackie killed him. - Blackie. - That's what comes of taking up with the likes of him. Well, it was me that made it possible for him to do this thing and l must take responsibility for his punishment. -What are you gonna do Captain? - l must shoot him Bertie, shoot him on sight. - Shoot him. - Sure, you're a man of your word Bertie. - Hello Bertie. - l've got something private to tell Blackie. - Oh Blackie l don't wanna. Oh alright. - Captain Fury's an angry man Blackie. - What do you think it matters to me what he is? - He says you done it. - Done what? - He says you killed Dupre. - l didn't know he was dead? Me kill Dupre? - l knew he was wrong Blackie. l'm going back to tell him. - Bertie, me and you is going to Sydney. l got plenty of money. - You did it. You did kill him didn't ya. You killed him and then took his money like Fury said. He's gonna shoot you on sight Blackie. - Come back Bertie. - He'll kill me too, if he sees me with ya. You're a dead man Blackie. You're a dead man. - Come back! - If Fury's coming here to kill Blackie, that'll be the end of the band and we can collect the hundred quid. Get in there and talk to him. Don't let him get away. - Oh no, no. - Shoot me on sight. l'll fight him. Shoot me on sight. What chances have you got? l need a way out. l gotta get out of here. - He has to go along that hall there. - Father, it's Bertie. Come in. - Mr. Bailey, they caught Captain Fury. - Fury's caught! - They'll hang him for sure. We've gotta do something. - After what he's done for us, the least we can do if fight for him. Dan, ride to the upper end of the valley, notify all the settler's. - Yes father. - Bertie you take the lower end. Tell 'em to bring all the fire arms they can find. -Well what are you 8tanding there sniveling for? We can fight too can't we? Come on, hurry up. - Hey where's Fury, what have you done with him? - l'll be glad to tell you. We're going to hang him. He killed Dupre and stole his money. - He didn't steal the money. You gotta let me out of here. l stole the money, but l didn't kill nobody. lf you hurt-- - l don't mind telling you we know he didn't do it, but he's going to hang just the same. And you'll be next. You won't mind hanging, it's just like falling down a well. - l've taken the liberty sir in getting everything ready for the speedy execution of this man Fury. l think you'll agree with me sir, that sweet justice is necessary in this case. A stitch in time which saves nine. That is of course with your permission? - As l understand it, you propose to hang this man for the murder of one Francois Dupre? - He deserves hanging a hundred times over sir. But the murder of Dupre is his most outrageous crime. - When you questioned him, what was his defense? - A man can have no defense Your Excellency, hi8 crimes were public scandal. - If you have not questioned him then l will. Remove the bandage. - But l protest Your Excellency. l beg of you to pronounce sentence now and let his execution be awarning to others. - Captain remove the bandage. - Yes sir. - Michael Fury, you are accused of the murder of Francois Dupre. - Of that l am innocent sir. - That's preposterous. Dupre informed and you killed him. You burned his cabin and destroyed the evidence. - That's a lie. l am an escaped convict Your Excellency, and l have born arms against this man. But only to prevent cruel iniustices. - After all Fury's done for us and our families. - Then l learned that Trist was conducting a campaign of terror, trying to drive everyone out of the valley in order to enlarge his own domain. He took full advantage of the fact that the settler's were peace Ioving, God fearing men. Men who respected the law and refused to resort to violence. Stop! Stop! Have you all gone mad? Would you jeopardize everything we've worked for? Gentleman this is his Excellency the Governor. - And these, l suppose are your peace loving settler's. - Your Excellency, if we'd known you were here this would not have happened. - But in my absence you would have thrust your way upon another mans premises bearing arms. - My men will drive them off sir. - No. Let them remain. - Help l am Francois Dupre, a free subject of this country. Help! - Quiet you fool or l'll blow your brains out. - Help! Help! l'm Francois Dupre, let me out of here. Help. - Let me out of here! - Shut up you fool. - Blackie. - Coughy. May the saints be serviced, what in the world are you doing here? - Blackie, l haven't very long. l'd like to die in the sun. - l'll get you out matey. - l'm sure he didn't kill Dupre sir. l'm sure as any man can be. - l am interested in nothing but facts Mr. Bailey. - And all the facts point to Fury's guilt. Even this man will admit there was bad blood between them. - Mr. Trist, l will conduct the inquiry. - John look! -Why it's Blackie. - Stay as you are! Who is this man? - It's Mr. Dupre. - Father! - There's your man Your Excellency. Dupre's the name. - Are you Francois Dupre? - Yes l am Francois Dupre and l've been held against my will. - You won't need that horse Trist. - And the next thing that happened sir, was that these blokes here, they come in and they jump all over him and that's all l know sir. - Thank you, young lady. - Yes sir. Except this sir. They was all very fine gentleman, especially Blackie. - Francois Dupre. - Your Excellency what these people have said is true. We owe our homes, perhaps our lives to the courage of Captain Fury, and l who was opposed to him most add my plea for your leniency. - Thank you. Bring in the prisoners. - Bertrand Green. - Yes sir. - For breaking bound and trespassing l add three years to your sentence. And you Jerry Black, by your own admission you're a thief. - But that's a thing of the past Your Excellency. l'm a changed man now. - l add 10 years to your sentence. - But Your Excellency. - Michael Fury. l find that the violations of which you are guilty, were committed under the most extenuating circumstances. lt becomes my honorable duty to pardon you. - Oh Michael l'm so happy. - Michael, we're very happy. - Captain Fury oh this is the best news l ever heard. Let me kiss you. - And these two men l parole them to your custody. (laughter)
