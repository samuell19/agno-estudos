NETFLIX PRESENTS We didn't see it coming. It's okay. What's your name? - Andrea. - Andrea. Does your arm hurt? Hello. Hi. Try to stay calm. We're here to help. We're gonna get you out. Slowly. One, two, three. And up. That's it. There. Help! Help me, please! Help me! I'm going to work. - Honey, can you stop for a second? Listen. - Vane. What is it? - Can you hang up the washing? - Sure. But give me a kiss. You look good. Come here. Yes, I'm leaving now. Okay, perfect. Bye, thanks. Kiko, hey. How are you today? Kiko, come on. Here, come on. That's why in Mexico they say, "First name Tequila, last name Mescal." Because tequila is a type of mescal. Tequila is made from agave... That's the plant you make mescal and tequila from. But for tequila you use blue agave. The agave heart goes into an oven, packed with other agave hearts. That dries it out. You use the oven to dry it, then you crush it and distill it. Distilling is when you separate the pulp and the juice. You heat the liquid to get sugar, and what do you get from sugar? Alcohol. The alcohol in spirits always comes from sugar. For example, whiskey comes from barley. It's the same... - Yankee 715, do you copy? - Go ahead. Unconscious female, possible code 3-0, at 74 Lázaro Cárdenas Street. Okay, copy that. - Hi. Excuse me. - Hi. She's dead. Yes, David? This is 715. We have a body. Five hundred. I won't pay more than 200 for this shit. Where did you get these? My grandma gave me them. Two hundred fifty, but I keep the ring. Damn dog. What's wrong? I stepped in shit from Vicente's dog. Vicente is disgusting. Hi, my love. - Aren't you gonna reply? - It's not important. I can reply later. I don't get why you're not replying. You want me to reply now? Fine, I'll reply. Reply if you want to. I don't care. My period came. Maybe you should see a gynecologist. Maybe the problem isn't with me. It could be psychosomatic. Maybe you're not getting pregnant because you don't want to. I have to go. Vane, wait. Wait, I'm sorry. Listen. I've had a shitty day. Look, I'll do the fertility test. You'll see, my sperm are... world class. You want some now? - A little bit. - No, they're waiting for me. A quickie. Look, I'm hard already. Just quickly. - I'm on my period. - You know I don't care. Ángel, stop! Don't get mad. It's no big deal. I wanted some affection, that's all. Okay. I'm sorry. It's fine. - See you later. - Au revoir. Shut up! Shut up! Ángel Hernández? Please come in. The results show that your sperm count is low. Most of them show poor motility, which means they can't reach the egg to fertilize it. Most of them? We're talking about 97%, Ángel. It's known as asthenospermia. There must be some mistake. In cases like yours, assisted reproduction has a fairly high success rate. You know... we should try more often. How about a weekend away? I'd love to, but I have to study. The exam's coming up. What exam is it? Canine psychology. Canine psychology? That's pointless. Animals don't have feelings. You're the one with no feelings. I'm gonna take a shower. ROBERTO FROM CLASS EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT Wait for it to go green. - Which one is this? - A hybrid. Now. It's good because there's no smell. 715, do you copy? Damn it. ...car with one code 3-32 and one 3-27. Is he alive or not? Is he alive or not? - Calm down. - Tell me if he's alive. He's in shock. He's distressed. Can you take him? - It's okay. - One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. He's lost consciousness. - Everything okay? - He's having convulsions. You're leaving already? Yes. It's 9:30. Can I get you anything? Can you bring the pills over? Can you pass me the remote? Yes? Yes, I'm leaving. Okay, great. Yes, see you later. Thanks. Who was it? Roberto. He's a classmate. Right, Roberto. So, you're good friends? We're classmates. He takes notes for me when I'm not there. That's it. That's why you get so dressed up to study? Roberto's good-looking? Ángel. - Don't start. - Start what? Honey. Get some rest. Spying on someone has never been so easy. With the Hacker-Phone app you can access the camera, microphone, photos and GPS of the person you want to monitor. So, it's not exactly legal. Want to know what your kids are up to? Want to know if your partner is lying to you, or even cheating? Where's Pedro? He's on leave. Why? Is it a problem? No, this is much better. You're prettier. Oh, isn't that nice. You can take me out dancing sometime. We're done. Do you have a cleaning cloth? Yes. Can you pass him a cloth, Vane? - Thanks. - Thanks. - Hi. - Come in. Thanks. How are things? How about you? Hanging in there. Hi, Ángel. How are you? Fucking great, how do you think? You're okay, right? Yes, all things considered. You've got to be strong at times like this, right? You can't give up, ever. "You can't give up." What the hell were you thinking when you were driving the ambulance? No, it wasn't my fault. No. Oh, come on. All you had to do was drive the fucking ambulance without crashing. All done. - We'll start taking our things down. - Okay, take them down now, please. - Bye. - Thanks. Thanks. I'll go too. - I don't know why the hell you came. - Ángel, stop. I'm so sorry, really. Sure you are. Why don't you study at home? We're doing a group project. Hey, can you go downstairs and get me some ice cream? S'il vous plaît. INSTALLING Thanks. Have fun. Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. Hello, Ángel. Come on, let's go. Quite the barker at night, isn't he? Yes, he barks when he's alone. I often visit my wife at the hospital at night. Right. And... sorry. Come on, give me the chair. You have one more to go. - This is pointless. Give me the chair. - Ángel, do the last one. Give me the fucking chair. You want the chair? Yes, I want the chair. Here you go. If you want it, you know what you have to do. You're enjoying this. You like torturing your patients, don't you? I love it. Especially you. Turn around. Turn around? Ta-da. You smell good. I told you you could do it. Okay, time to rest. Noodle soup again? It was on special. Can you pass me a spoon? Yes. Thanks. Sandra thinks I'm improving. She said I'm making good progress, and I could get some feeling back. That's great. You don't seem happy. Something wrong? Of course I am. What's wrong? I've been offered a work placement at a vet's. Do you have time for that? I thought I could ask to work part-time at the call center. And what would we live on? I don't know, Ángel. "I don't know." You want to leave your job for this, and you don't know what we'll live on. I can't do everything. You can't do everything? So it's my fault. I didn't say that. So what will we live on? My shitty disability payments? Are you aware of everything I do for you? What you do for me? What about everything I've done for you? You know what, just go look after the animals at the fucking vet's. - Don't start, please. - I'll start if I want to. This offer is 45 euros per month, including taxes. You said your name is Vanesa, right? That's a very pretty name. As I said, this offer has the same advantages as your previous package. For example, it includes international calls. Excuse me. I don't mean to bother you, Vanesa. Where are you from? I'm French. Sir, I'm not allowed to have personal conversations. Would you like me to change your package? Shit. Hi, this is Vane. Please leave a message. Kiko, no, not in there. Hey, beautiful. Come here. It's okay. Come on, here. Have a good day, Vane. You too, Vicente. Morning. Didn't you get my messages? No. Did you call? All night. So, why was your phone off? I ran out of battery. I'm in serious pain and you left me with no painkillers. - There's a bottle in the cupboard. - I looked everywhere. What do you mean? I left them here. I'm telling you they're not there. How could you forget something so important? I'm sure I left them here. Well, they're not there, and I had a terrible night. I don't understand. I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry? I'm the sorry one. I'm in unbearable pain. Sorry. I'll get some more right now. Good. I can't take it anymore. I'm going crazy. I'm sure I left the pills there. I never liked Ángel. You have to get out of there. I can't leave him now. Vane, you have to leave him. I don't know what to do. It's such a mess. He's abusing you. Hi. How did it go? What's going on? It's your favorite meal. Padrón peppers and roasted salmon fillets. That's great. Put on that dress I gave you. Tonight is a special night, my love. You look amazing. Whoa. Cheers. Go on, try it. Very good. I'm glad. Today is a fresh start, Vane. I'm going to fight to get better. I'm going to make you happy, I promise. Ángel... You don't have to say anything. I'm so grateful for everything you do for me. We'll refurbish my grandma's room so you have somewhere to study. You've got to do that work placement at the vet's. I know this has been really hard for you. Yes. I'm getting used to this new situation. My love... I made an appointment at the fertility clinic. We're gonna have this baby we've been trying for. Hey, it's kicking in. No, leave the dress on. I can't feel anything. Should I stop? Vane, can you bring me a towel? Vane! MONTHS LATER Celebrate Christmas with the best chicken in town.

That's always a good thing, right? It's 7:00 p.m., 6:00 in the Canary Islands, Friday, January 3, 2020. Here's the news. Stop here. China notified the WHO... ...unknown. Of the 44 documented cases, 11 patients are seriously ill, while the other 33 patients are in stable condition. According to information from Chinese media, the cause could be a virus that originated in a live animal market in Wuhan. It's feared this could be a respiratory virus similar to SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome... MEDICATION ROOM AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY Morphine. I'm in a lot of pain. I need anesthetics. I'm risking my neck doing this. Vane. What are you doing here? I wanted to see you. I haven't heard from you since you left. It's best if we don't see each other. I know. I'm sorry. I needed to know how you are. I'm fine, thanks, but please stop this. Just a second, please. Ángel. Don't follow me. I don't want to bother you. I just want to say goodbye. You did the right thing, leaving me. You deserve better. And I just can't face carrying on. I promise you'll never see me again. Goodbye, Vane. Ángel, wait. I'll walk with you, if you like. Are you sure? It's fine. So, how are you doing? Good. I'm doing the work placement at the vet's. I told you. Thanks for walking with me. Well... I'm going to go. I put your things in a box. You can come get them, if you like. I found your passport too. Come in. Don't you have a cleaner? The antidepressants leave me without any energy. I'll give you the number of an agency. Why don't you stay for a while? I'll make some tea. I have to go. Thanks. You've forgotten me already, right? Are you seeing someone? You need help. Where are my things? In my grandma's room. Next to the bed. Over there. Fuck! What did you do? What are you doing? What are... Good morning. Get some rest? Don't scream, Vane. I'll never be able to forget you. Because you taught me to love. With a sip of champagne. Making a toast to new love. The soft light in that spot. Made my heart beat. It's so easy to remember. Vane, where are you? I've been calling. I can't find you. With a sip of champagne. Making a toast... RICARDO, I'M SORRY. WE CAN'T HAVE THIS BABY. I NEED TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU. ...I kissed you. I fell in love. With your gaze. With a sip of champagne. Making a toast to new love. The soft light in that spot. Made my heart beat. Will you stop screaming? I'm really happy you're back home again. I saw Ricardo today. He says hi. He told me you're having a baby together. Congratulations. Untie me, Ángel. Help! Help! Help! We won't need this once you learn to behave. Who is it? It's Vicente. What do you want? Could you open the door, please? What do you want? I'm busy. Coming! What is it? There was music playing all day yesterday. It sounded like a nightclub. I didn't sleep for months because of your dog. I play music one time and you come and complain? I've apologized for that, Ángel. I was visiting my wife at the hospital, and I couldn't take him. But my wife passed away. And so did my dog. Well... he was killed. Well, I'm sorry. Wait. By the way, is Vanesa alright? Vanesa left me months ago. It's just... I heard screaming. It must have been another apartment. I haven't seen Vane for ages. But... I saw you come in together the other day. She came to get her things. Look, Ángel. I know the screaming came from here. I heard it through the back window. Okay. Hang on. Wait. I'd prefer not to have to explain this, but... I'm with an escort. You know, a prostitute. How else could I be with a girl, Vicente? Oh, I see. Well... Please don't play music so loudly. - Don't worry. - Thank you. You're very serious. Everything okay? Better than ever. My girlfriend and I are having a baby. Really? Congratulations! I didn't know you had a girlfriend. Are you still single? Yes. Don't you want to have kids? Well, yes, but I'm not in a rush. Have you thought about freezing your eggs? Don't be silly. I'm 35. I'm still young. Not that young. I have friends your age who needed IVF. I'd hurry up. The clock's ticking, Sandra. Ángel. I need to talk to you. What are you doing here? Looking for Vane. She's missing. Do you know anything? I haven't seen her for months. What do you mean, missing? Well... Vane and I are together. We've been going out for a while. We fell in love. We wanted to tell you, but we didn't want to hurt you. I don't know. I can't find her anywhere. I'm worried. Are you okay? Yes, but my gut's blocked. I have an operation on Tuesday. I'm really sorry. Do you mind if I go? Sure. Let me know if you hear anything. Please. You should use the bathroom. A shower will help. Come on. What have you done to me? - What have you done to me? - Relax, it's only temporary. What have you done? It's just an epidural. You're sick. What do you want to listen to today? This one. You loved this. The blue sky above us could collapse. And the ground could cave in. Little matters if you love me. I couldn't care about the whole world. As long as love fills my mornings. As long as my body trembles at your touch. There are no problems that matter to me. My love. Because you love me. Hi, Ángel. You won't answer my calls. I still haven't heard from Vane. Are you sure you haven't heard from her? I'm worried. Please, if you know something, let me know. Ángel, I keep calling, and you won't pick up. What's going on? I need Vane to show up now. I'm going to call the police. Answer my calls, please. Pick up the phone. Delicious. If it's a boy, I thought we could call him Ángel. What do you think? If it's a girl, you can choose the name. Would you like some wine? Just a drop. You shouldn't drink in your condition. There you go. It isn't easy to forgive you. I swear that I'm really trying. You should see me at physical therapy. Sandra and I have a very special relationship. Don't be jealous. No! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help me! Help! Help! Open the door! I'm calling the police. Coming! - What is it? - I'm calling the police. I heard noises and a woman shouting. I'm sure it was Vanesa. - Vanesa isn't here. No one is. - What happened to your head? I'm calling the police. Fine, come in. Come and look. Vane, dear. What has he done to you? I'm calling the police. What are you doing? You're... You're crazy. Fermín. Come to my place now. I need you. I'm telling you to come now. Take it. Now let's clean this up. Yes? Can you open the door, please? Who is it? The police. Coming. - Good morning. - Good morning. Are you Ángel Hernández? Yes. - Can we ask you some questions? - Sure. Come in, please. This won't take a moment. Were you involved with Vanesa François? Yes. Did you live together? We used to live together, but not anymore. Do you know Ricardo Martín? He was a colleague of mine. Why? Police. How can I help you? Yes, I'd like to report a missing person. Who is missing? My girlfriend. When did she disappear? I haven't heard from her since yesterday. Did she leave any note or... She sent a text message, but I'm sure she didn't write it. How can you be so sure? What number was it sent from? It was sent from her phone, but I'm sure she didn't write it. Okay. How do you know for sure? Because we're expecting a baby, okay? Do you understand? We're expecting a baby. She wouldn't just leave without warning. Please, I'm asking you to find her. When did you see him last? I haven't heard from him in months. When was the last time you saw Vanesa? She came to say goodbye a week ago. To say goodbye? Yes, she said she was leaving, going back to France. Did you know Vanesa and Ricardo were in a relationship? Yes. I was happy for them. Easy. It'll all be over soon. Don't worry about the baby. I'll take care of him. It's for the neuropathic pain. Of course. That's everything, Mr. Hernández. You've been very helpful. You're welcome. Vane, wake up. You spend all day sleeping. Ángel. You can't keep me here like this. You'll kill us both. Me and the baby. Open your mouth. Vane, hurry up. Lunch is ready. I made a spinach omelet, for the iron. Did you know that most birth defects are linked to maternal nutrition? No. I didn't know that. Thanks. Take a look over there. It's lovely. There's one other thing. Will you marry me? When I trust you, we'll get married. Eat up. Could you close the door, please? Please. Vane. You're burning up. Ángel... We're going to lose the baby. I'll go to the pharmacy. No. No! Help! Help me! Get off me! Bastard! No! Stop! Let me go! Ángel. I didn't know you had a girlfriend. Lucky guy. Happy to see me? From now on, it'll be me that looks after you. I'll never be able to forget you. Because you taught me to love. With a sip of champagne. Making a toast to new love. The soft light in that spot. Made my heart beat. It's so easy to remember. Every time I make a toast. With a sip of champagne. Making a toast to new love. And that was when. I kissed you. I fell in love. With your gaze. With a sip of champagne. Making a toast to new love. The soft light in that spot. Made my heart beat
