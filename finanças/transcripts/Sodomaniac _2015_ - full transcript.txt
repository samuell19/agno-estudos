(man groaning) You fool, you haven't been on the beat long enough for your stomach to handle this. (flies buzzing) (vomiting) - Jesus Christ. Have you ever seen anything like that? - Freddie fuckin' Mercury has never even seen anal carnage like this before. - Damn. Who, what in the world could even do something like this? - Looks like what we're dealing with here is some kinda sodomaniac. (intense gloomy music) - [Voiceover] Drop that shit.

You have a way with words. - [Voiceover] Three years huh? - Three long mother fucking years man. Damn it's good to be out now. - [Voiceover] I don't think I coulda done it man. - Shit none of you little pussies could've done it man. Jail ain't no cake walk, shit's not easy man. - [Voiceover] Then how did you do it? - Hey one day at a time, that's it. But I tell you what, just knowing that one day I get out and be around all these fine ass ladies. God damn it feel good son. - I know you got to be horny. - Yo, horny ain't the word.

Look, what do you think alcohol is? It's God's date rape drug. Think guys buy girls drinks just to be nice? No, they buy chicks drinks to loosen the waist line of their panties. Think these other assholes could get laid without 'em? - How's one of the first things you gonna ask a man when he come out the pen, is whether or not he been ass raped, or he got dookie stains all over his dick man? - That's not what I was gonna ask. - Oh it's not? It's not. Here I am sittin' here, I'm trying to have a drink, forget about the last three years of my life and you gonna ask me some shit like that. - I didn't know you'd get so mad. - You didn't know I'd get so mad? What I look like to you some kinda fuckin' fag? Am I god damn Teddy or something? See, that's why people don't like you. Right there. - People like me. - No, people don't like you, that's why they call you Prejack. You a premature ejaculating mother fucker. Damn I hate you son. - He's got a point there man. - I'm sorry. - I gotta get outta here man. I need to go somewhere and get some titties up in my face, forget about you fags. You know I ain't gonna forget what you said right? - I know, I said I'm sorry. - You gonna pay for that. All you mother fuckers gonna pay. Give me another beer man. - All right all right. - Hey and don't do nothing funny to my drink. I know how you and your boys play. That's what the fuck I'm talkin' about right there. - Hello! - [Ex-Convict] Shit. - What can I get you? - Can I get a brick dog vodka please? - Sure. - [Ex-Convict] And you can throw that on my tab home boy. - No no no no-- - [Ex-Convict] What's up baby? - That's on me. Name's Todd. - Uh, thanks Todd but I got my own drinks. - Well at least let me take 'em back to your table huh? I'd hate to see you spill 'em all over the place, ruin that pretty little dress you're wearing. (laughing) - Do those lines ever work? - I don't know honey you tell me. - Maybe, but I don't think my friends over there are gonna want the extra company. - [Prejack] Hey, what's the wig for? Are you guys coming from chemotherapy or something? - No, it's my girl's birthday and we're all wigging out. - Oh, it's your friend's birthday? Oh we gotta come over and say hello now. Don't you know it's a whole year of bad luck not to get hit on on your birthday? Now, do you want your friends to have a whole year of bad luck? - I don't know, I don't even know you guys. - [Todd] Aw, we're good people, right guys? - Oh we're the best. - Well, you seem okay, but I still have to check with them first. - You do that. We'll come over with the beers, peace offering shot, your friends don't want us around, well at least you got good table service. - Well, my mom always told me not to take drinks from strangers. - Do you always listen to what your mother tells you? - I'll be right back. So, those guys over there wanna buy our drinks and come join us. - Finally, one of these cheap bastards did something. Are they cute? - Mm, so so. - [Voiceover] So then why bring them over? They look like fucking creeps. - Ugh, always the positive one aren't we? How do you know they're creeps? They seem all right to me. - A little bit of alcohol. - I'm just saying, I wouldn't trust them. - Little bit of GHB. - It's not like we're screwing them, they're gonna come over and buy our drinks. - And a little bit of Spanish fly. - [Voiceover] Makes one great aphrodisiac. - Hell yeah. - [Prejack] Let's do this. - You know what, I've had enough wigging out for one night anyway. - [Friend] Really, you're gonna leave? - I don't have time to deal with these scum bags. - [Friend] Ugh, all right. - You got that? Oh wait a second, aw one left. That only leaves three. - Uh, sorry boys, looks like you and Prejack are gonna have to find their own pussy. - Oh come on! - Hey man, you can always talk Teddy. - [Man] Yo, let's get it in son. - [Todd] Let's do it boys. - Real funny guys real fuckin' funny. I'll just stick with the big bird cage over here. - Mother fuckers. Mother fuckers gonna play me like that? - Well, here have a shot. - Don't give a shit. Ain't that some shit? - I'm used to it. - I know you used to it numb nuts. But I don't like being played like that. Oh yeah. - Well-- - Mother fuckers gonna pay. - At least we got a free shot. - Yo. You a, that was one of the girls' shots man. - Oh shit. Oh shit. Out of my way bitch! - [Voiceover] My beer! - [Prejack] Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. - These, these are my fuckin' friends. Shit gonna change. - [All] Hey! (intense dance music) - Shut up bitch, I'm going to the bathroom. - [Voiceover] Yeah Jones, help her to the bathroom. (high five slapping) (tense electronic music) - [Voiceover] Yo watch it! - What up reject? You look like shit. Little more than usual. - I had a shot. - I bet you did buddy. - Hey cuties! - Hey Teddy. - It's a shame to see such delish boys all alone on a night like tonight! Hey Teddy? That's all I get? Shit I'm the best lookin' person in here that's probably gonna talk to you tonight, and that's how you greet me? - [Man] Oh Chris breathe. - Well someone's a little toasty. - I think he had a little too much. - Good, that's how I like 'em. - Well, come on pal, I gotta get you outta here. I'll catch you later Teddy. - See ya! I'll get those boys one day. Teddy always gets his man. (gloomy music) - Shit, I forgot my jacket, I'll be right back. (footsteps tapping) (eerie music) - [Voiceover] Prejack. Prejack. (thunder booming) Come here. Come here Prejack I'm over here. Over here. - Hello? Derrick? - [Voiceover] This isn't Derrick Prejack. (hissing) - [Prejack] Oh shit! - [Voiceover] Run Prejack! Run! I'm gonna get you Prejack. Your ass is mine Jacky boy. Run Prejack run! (laughing) Hey Jack. - Who's there? I'm really gonna be sick, you guys gotta get me outta here. I drank that shot. - [Voiceover] I drank that shot, I drank that shot guys. Get me outta here, get me outta here! - What the fuck? - [Voiceover] Run! Run Prejack run! (Prejack breathing heavily) - Too fucked up for this shit. - [Voiceover] Gotcha. - What are you doing? What do you want from me? Oh no! - [Voiceover] Let me see that pretty ass of yours. - Get that knife away from my ass. No! (Prejack screaming) (killer grunting) (birds chirping) - Where the fuck am I? And where the fuck are my clothes? What the hell did you do last night? Fucked up this time. God damn it! (exhaling) Quiet night out with the girls right? All right. (upbeat tropical music) - God damn, those girls were fine last night boys. - Eh, I've had better. - I've seen the girls that you've been with. - Yeah bro, my cousin in the Army seen less grenades than your ass. - Man fuck you guys man. Chick I had last night was a real ball drainer. - Yeah I thought you looked a little lighter. - Now now boys, last night was just a warm up for tonight. - That's right boys, this place is gonna be crawling with poon. - I'm gonna eat that shit up. (grunting) (laughing) - Speaking of poon. - Oh shit. Good morning! - Good morning. - Hey walking kinda funny there sweetie, Chauncey must have did a number on your ass. (laughing) - Hit it so good she can't walk right in the morning. - Oh, that's real nice, you talk to a lady like that? - No, no it's not at all. - I see no lady's presence so who gives a fuck? - Really? You're really gonna talk to me like that? - Why not? We already got what we wanted from you. - And it was good. - Wait, what do you mean we? Got to be kidding me. - Sorry sweetheart, we don't joke around here. - Actually we have very bad bad senses of humor. - All right that's enough. - Hey you guys are something else you know that? - Can I give you a ride home? - No, stay away from me, I don't want any of you near me. - Look, are you sure I-- - I'm sure, I just wanna get out of here. - Then go! - Yeah, scram trick, scram! You're stinking up the fuckin' place. ♪ Na na na na ♪ Na na na na ♪ Hey hey hey ♪ Goodbye ♪ - Come on Derrick. ♪ Na na na na ♪ Na na na na ♪ Hey hey hey ♪ Goodbye ♪ - Yo you got her wig. - Jesus Christ guys really? - What? What, what's the problem man? - Do you treat every woman that comes through here like that? - No. - No, normally we make it a rule to get those sluts out of here by the morning. - You guys are unbelievable. - Calm down guys, we got more important things to take care of. Throwing a big party tonight, we need booze, we need snacks, and most importantly, we need-- - Drugs! - Yes, thank you Trent, we need more drugs. Throw this party every year, not letting anybody down. - Shit, I don't wanna let my dick down you know what I mean? Can only get the finest of the mother fuckin' fine up in this place. So. - You wanna do some clam diving tonight bro. - Diving in, diving in. - You guys ever let up? - Hamilton, what is with this guy? Why is he such a puss? Do you understand what you've been given? The golden mother fuckin' ticket to pussy. I don't think he deserves it guys. - Nope, doesn't deserve it. - Give him a break guys. And Derrick, please try to loosen up. If you're ever gonna lose that V of yours, you're gonna have to get that stick outta your ass. - Stop the presses, stop the fuckin' presses. - Did I just hear that right or am I just really baked from my wake? - Derrick, you're still a virgin? - No, what he meant was-- - What I meant was he's still a virgin. - Your balls must be huge. - Derrick, how you go this long without ever busting one up in there? - Even my autistic cousin has shot one up the cherry shoot. - All right guys calm down, I didn't bring it up so we could all bust his balls, I brought up so that this mother fucker busts his own balls tonight if you know what I'm saying. - I'm picking up what you're throwing down. - Man we gotta get this pussy laid tonight. - Thanks guys but I really don't think I need your help. - I think you do bro. - I think you do. I think you do. I think he does, we're gonna get you laid. We're gonna get you laid, yeah yeah. Gonna get that little dry dick wet boy. Yeah. - [Chauncey] You better get that dick some swimmies it ain't ever been swimming before. - Throw that fucker right in, that's how I learned. - [Derrick] Okay guys. - Just don't pull a Prejack. - Oh I'm Prejacking, I'm Prejacking, I just stuck it in and. - Mother fucker came before he put the condom on man. - God it's so lubed. - Wait a minute guys. - Derrick, is this how you always imagined it? - All right enough enough. (laughing) - No, for real, wait a minute, where's Prejack? - He's probably up in his room Prejacking. - I thought, he didn't come home with you guys? - No, we all thought he left with you. - Nah, he got wasted and he had one of them spiked shots. - He actually drank that? - You gave him a spiked drink? - I mean I told him to drink it as a joke, I never thought the little sphincter boy would actually drink it. - Well, I mean, we were talking with Teddy. - He was with Teddy? - Dude he got straight raped. (laughing) - You know how Teddy is, he's always trying to bring some drunk guy home, gay or straight. - Just ask Trent. - He didn't fuck me, I just slept on his couch, I was fuckin' wasted bro. - Dude, now how you know it didn't happen? - Yo fuck you man. - All right guys we all know Trent didn't get straight raped, I'm sure Prejack is fine. Can we get back to business? Can we start planning this party without any further interruptions? (doorbell ringing) What? Trent! - [Chauncey] Is it Valentine's Day already Trent? - [Trent] Fuck you man. - Who are they... Oh. - Who would be sending me flowers? - Yeah, well who are they from man, who are they from? - I'm lookin' dude, I'm fuckin' lookin'. Jesus. - I hope he's cute. - Wish somebody would send me flowers. - Aw, I'll send you flowers Chaunce. - Oh, Todd you're my hero. - What's it say? - [Chauncey] Is it from his mommy? I bet his mommy loves him. - Trent's mommy loves him. (smooching) - What's it say? - Doesn't say nothing dude, it doesn't say nothin'. - Fuck me, okay buddy. - I wonder if they're from Prejack's secret admirer. - [Trent] What? - Oh you know that dildo got the same kind of flowers yesterday. - Yeah and they looked just like that shit. Holy shit man. - That fucker didn't tell me about gettin' any flowers. - Nah man I fuckin' seen it when he got it. He fuckin' took the card and ran right up into his room. - What are we waiting for? - Maybe we should respect his privacy guys. - [Both] Nah. (giggling) (suspenseful music) - Dude, it smells like sour milk in here. - No. No that's jizz man, that's jizz. - I don't think we should be in here, this is Prejack's room. - Relax Derrick, we just wanna see the flowers. - And there they are. (intense effect) - What? (laughing) - I don't know what the fuck this thing's trying to say. - Hey Trent was yours as anally cryptic as his? - Mine was nothing like this. I don't know what this shit's about. - You guys got a secret admirer, that's what that shit's about. - How sweet is that? - Yo, we ain't got no fuckin' secret admirer, it's just somebody fuckin' with us, and how do I know it isn't one of you mother fuckers? - Doubt it. - Can we get back to the party? - Yeah, fuck this home boy shit anyway man. - Right? Let's forget about this shit, let's get ready for the party. - Right, 'cause a missing friend's not important. - He's around. I'm not worried about his pre-cumming ass. Who's ready for their missions? (tense music) Chauncey, you're on snacks. - Good dude, 'cause I got the major munchies. - [Friend] It is the least important of the supplies, but then again, this is what will keep the fat girls busy while we mack on their hot friends. Todd, you're in charge of the liquid pantie remover. (upbeat goofy music) No, make sure it's stuff girls like. - Oh. Yeah. - [Friend] Get some spice rum, vodka, and a whisky. Probably a tequila, and don't forget the juice, sour mix, and sodas, diet sodas. That should cover just about everything. Trent, you my man are in charge of the drugs. (quick electronic music) That's right, we need all kinds of drugs. Uppers, downers, skippy-flippies, husker doos, husker don'ts, scooter dees, jelly-stingers, trick sticks, dingers, dangers, polly wallies, bing bang, hashish, flying Willards, PCP, sinkers, pot, shrooms, and of course the three greatest letters in the alphabet, GHB. Derrick, since Prejack's not here, you're on bitch duty. - You know, I still can't believe you guys aren't worried about where Prejack is what the fuck? Ugh. - Get every inch of this shit hole spotless. Nothing makes a girl less horny than a dirty pad. (doorbell ringing) Damn it Cunter, what do you want? We're very busy. - Did you guys hear? - Hear what, that you're not invited to our party and you're here to beg us like you always do? Yeah, I heard that. - No no, about what happened to Prejack last night. - What happened to Prejack? - Can I come in? - To our house? No fuckin' way, we got a big party tonight, I don't need you stinkin' up the place. - Guess you don't want to know what happened to Prejack. - Come on Hamilton, yeah we wanna know, just let him in. - Dude it's gonna take days to get the stink out of the couch. - Ah, come on Hamilton, let go of the man. - Fine, you guys are really overstepping your fuckin' boundaries with me today. Come here, Cunter. So what's the big news Cunter? - Hunter, you guys know my name is Hunter, it is not Cunter, so if you guys wanna know, you have to stop calling me that. - No way I'm gonna-- - No we'll call you Hunter, just get on with it. - Well, Prejack was found in the alley behind the bar. - Oh woo. - So he passed out in the alley, that's nothing new. - Well how's this for new? His asshole was ripped to shreds. (intense music) His guts were practically spewing out of his exit hole. - How'd you hear about this? - My mom's a police dispatch, she got the call late last night. - Do you know what this means? - Means that fuckin' Prejack was a fuckin' bird shitter. - Bird shitter? - I always knew that kid was a little sissy faggot. I told you guys. - Once everyone finds out, they're not gonna come to this party, they're gonna think that we're all fuckin' fruits too. - Really? Is that what they're gonna think? Is that your main concern? - You're right. Maybe we don't have to worry. Cunt, Hunter, who else knows about this? - Well as of now no one else knows. The story's not even breaking until tomorrow. - Good. Then we have time to do damage control. - But as I said, that is as of now no one knows, but if I start babbling. - You won't. - I don't know. I might not if-- - If what? - [Hunter] If you guys let me come to the party tonight. - Fine, you can come. But you can't talk to anybody, you gotta stand in the shadows, and you don't drink any of our booze. - Okay you got it you got it. - Now get outta here, and keep that litter box you call a mouth shut. - Okay guys, all right, I'll see you later. Got it, see you guys later. - Fuckin' idiot. - Can you believe that? - What that our friend was fuckin' ass murdered? - No that fuckin' Cunter's coming over to our party tonight. - This is gonna suck big time. - Guys, no one cares that fuckin' Prejack's dead? - Ah, the guy said he always wanted to go out with a bang, so. (laughing) - All right. Enough fuckin' around. Everybody get to your duties, be back here in an hour or two. Let's not let Prejack ruin yet another fuckin' party. All right everybody get your hands in. (hands slapping) You gonna get in on this Derrick or what? Look, Prejack's dead, there's nothing we can do about that. After the party tonight, we'll mourn. But right now we have bigger fish to fry. - Hopefully I'll be mourning in the pussy of a big titty redhead. (laughing) - Look, it's bad luck not to have the whole wolf pack in the circle. Get your hand in. All right, on three. One, two, three. - [All] Wolf pack! - Let's get it in son. (people chattering) (calm hip hop music) (knocking) (people shouting) ♪ I know I'm on a ♪ I know I'm ♪ - Yo, Prejack got these flowers with this creepy ass message man. Ends up bleeding like a pig from his corn hole. I'm afraid the same thing's gonna happen to me man. - Why don't you do another fuckin' line man? That should help. First off man, I was being sarcastic about that doing another line shit, that shit ain't gonna help you none. Second off, don't be comin' up in here talkin' about no ass rape with no man. I don't wanna know nothin' about that. I don't wanna hear that shit. I ain't your fuckin' psychologist. What kind of person do you think I am? You think I sit around with my buddies, talkin' about gettin' ass raped? No I don't, I ain't got no friends, 'cause I ain't got no time for no friends. I ain't got no time for no friends, because I'm always with some dumbass mother fucker like you, talking about his problems. His boy got ass humped to death, what kinda shit is that man? - Sorry. - Don't be man, I'm just trying to be tougher. Everybody says I'm too nice. And everybody says drug dealers are supposed to be mean, and hard, and shit like that. That's why I got me one of these. (gun clacking) Pretty cool huh? Makes me feel like a mother fucking man. - Can I hold it? - Hell no, you don't touch another man's gun what the fuck is wrong with you kid? Here's your shit, could be 600. (glass shattering) (tense music) (drowned out hip hop music) (distant thudding) - Dude, you okay? (intense gloomy music) Dude. Is everything all right in there? - [Voiceover] Got ya. - What the fuck? - [Voiceover] Shut the fuck up and roll over! - No! - [Voiceover] Well then have it your way. - Oh! Oh god, please god, no please god. - [Voiceover] This is God. - Oh god! - [Voiceover] Not the bearded guy, it's just your ass. My god. - Oh, ah! (laughing) - [Voiceover] More! Ah! (intense grinding) (knocking on door) Don't even fucking think about it. - [Voiceover] Is everything okay in there? This is the hotel manager. I called the police. - Thank god. See mother fucker? You ain't gettin' away with this. - [Voiceover] You lucked out this time. Or did you? - What? - [Voiceover] Having to tell the police and then your wolf pack that you were raped. Your father would love to hear that story. Or how about one day, when you look into your son's eyes, and he asks you why you always have to sit on that special pillow. Hemorrhoids maybe? - Fuck you! - [Voiceover] That's right, you'll have to explain this to everyone for the rest of your life. How do you think they'll treat you after that? Try and explain to the girls you bang before you have to take off an adult diaper before you get down. 'Cause you'll have to, I've already done a real number down there. Ain't no shit ever staying in there. - Just kill me now. - [Voiceover] You had your chance. I think living with this is a worse fate for you. Or maybe your drug dealing friend in there can help you in the bathroom. Later sweet cheeks. (smooching) (laughing) - [Voiceover] I don't have time for this shit! Is everything okay in there? - [Trent] I'm fine, I'm fine. (knocking) - [Voiceover] Hello? This is the fucking hotel manager. - Fuckin' ass. - [Voiceover] Is everything okay in there? I hear some crazy shit going on in there. Knock knock, who's there? It's the fucking hotel manager and I don't have time for this shit. Did I mention I'm the hotel manager? (knocking) I'm a hotel manager, not deaf. I can hear you in there, fucking answer me. - Can I hold this? - [Voiceover] I make five dollars a fuckin' hour to manage this god damn-- - I wanna feel like a man. I wanna feel like a man. (gun fires) - [Voiceover] You don't like me or somethin'? (intense effect) - Shit. Aw, please don't let this shit be for fuckin' me. (tense music) Holy shit dude just fuckin' scared the shit outta me. - What's scary is the mess that's inside. How often you guys clean? It's gross in there. Maybe if you take like a Sunday when you're not doing anything in the, who are they from? - I don't know. - Have you heard from Trent at all today? - No man, I haven't heard from him since he left. - [Voiceover] Please enjoy the music while your party is reached. ♪ I can't answer the phone, I can't answer the phone ♪ Why, 'cause a bitch is fuckin' suckin' my bone ♪ I can't answer the phone, I can't answer the phone ♪ Why, 'cause a bitch is fuckin' suckin' my bone ♪ Lickin' it dry, lickin' it dry ♪ Lick lick lick lick lick lick lick ♪ Lickin' it dry, lickin' it dry ♪ Lickin' it ♪ - No, he's not answering. - Do you think?

He's a fuckin' weirdo. - Oh I'm a weirdo? I'm a fuckin' weirdo 'cause I can put two and two together? Why didn't you open the card outside then? - Just in case it's me I don't wanna know. - He's got a fuckin' point all right? Prejack gets flowers, dead. Trent gets flowers, still not home yet. - He's fine. Chauncey give him a call. - Got it. - All right, when Trent picks up the phone and talks to Chauncey, I need you to, I mean I need you to stop with this fuckin' thing you got going on here. - All right, look, if Trent picks up then yeah I'll drop it all right? And I'll just go along with your party. - Answered. - See, now put it on speaker phone so these fuckin' twats can hear his voice. - [Voiceover] Check the card ya fuckin' homos. I want you to see who's next. - Hang it up, hang it up! - Who the fuck was that man? Yo D man I think you were right bro. - I knew something was up. - Shut up, shut up, are you two fuckin' with me? Are you fuckin' with Hamilton? For real fuckin' real are you fuckin' with me? - No dude, we're not fuckin' with you man. - This means Trent's fucking dead. - It does not fuckin' mean that. - Well then what does it mean Hamilton? All right, that sure as fuck wasn't Trent's voice on the phone. I guarantee ya, whoever's name is on that card is fuckin' next man. - That's bullshit. - We need to check that card. - The only thing we need to do, is we need to find Trent, and we need to call that Jamaican kid from Planned Parenthood, 'cause as of right now, we don't have any drugs. - On it. - Look, Hamilton I know this party's important to you, but this is our fucking lives here.

Wait what if it's your name on the card? Or what if it's my name on the card all right? At least stay here, at least I can watch your back and you can watch mine. - That's really sweet guys. - Fuckin' adorable. - All right bro, I'll do this for you. (hands clapping) (cat meowing) - Are we done? Are we done? (sighing) - I guess so. - Good, then let's fucking party! (intense dubstep music) - Derrick, I still don't know about this man. - The killer could be anyone. We just have to narrow it down. - Do you really think the killer's gonna come? Here, tonight. - I mean, I guarantee it. Whoever it is knows we're gonna be here, it's a perfect night to strike. - I'm not feeling this bro. - Just stick with me and we'll be fine. - I need another drink.

But, you think any of these dudes are the ones down here trying to rip us a new asshole? - Are you serious? Nobody's trying to rape us man. - [Chauncey] Then what the hell's going on? - I don't know.

But, would he have a reason to do it? - He was pretty pissed off the other night when we left him at the bar. All you mother fuckers is gonna pay he said. - Jesus that makes sense, I mean man gets out of prison, you guys are utter pricks to him, and now he's getting his revenge. - Does that make any sense?

All right, you can take the softest little sissy, and it'll turn him into a complete ass loving fuckin' animal bro. - Teddy, Teddy! - Out of your fuckin' mind man? - Whoa, calm down sweetie. - [Derrick] Teddy's always trying to get with us, we always deny him. - Teddy is very fuckin' aggressive. There's not that many gay guys to hook up with around here. Maybe he finally snapped. His shit's so backed up now, when he bangs a dude, he completely destroys their asshole. - Slow down man, slow down. I need you to be a little more sober. - Whoa, shit! - This shit cute. Look at you huh? - Hey Blake, what's going on bro? Enjoying the party I see. - Yeah yeah I'm lovin' it yo.

Fuck it I tell you what, I'm gonna be banging all three of 'em tonight, son, and I can't wait yo. - Yeah no, we just thought-- - Well I just thought the best way to get you assholes back was to bring the finest ladies you will have at this party and not let you guys touch 'em huh? (angelic choir) Oh oh oh, hell no Hunter! No, you on that list too mother fucker. - Well, we can take him off the list. - Yeah. Derrick, those bitches are fuckin' fine man.
