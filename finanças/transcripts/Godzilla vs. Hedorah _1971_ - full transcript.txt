Yeah, he's a superman! Ken, time for lunch. Okay. Darling. Darling! Good afternoon. Mr. Gohei! Have you brought us another unusual fish? Yes, this is quite an odd one. Professor, what kind is it? lt's a tadpole, right? lt's too big for that. Do tadpoles live in the ocean? Oh, right. Where did you catch this? That prime spot for shrimp fishing. But l didn't catch a single shrimp. Suruga Bay is done for if the fishing keeps getting worse. What is this creature that appeared after the ships collided in Suruga Bay? Some sort of sea monster? Or some nation's secret weapon? Whatever it was... its terrible force heaved the ships apart in an instant. lt's a tadpole monster! Papa, it's just like what the old fisherman brought over. l'll be back in half an hour. - So 2:00? - Yeah. Set your watch. lt's empty. Papa! The tadpole! Please come back, Papa. Ouch! So this monster was smaller than the one that sunk the two ships? That's right. There isn't just one Hedorah. There are big ones and - Right, Papa? Hedorah? That's what my son calls them. Because they come from hedoro, a kind of polluted sludge. Sludge? Professor, do you agree? lt's too early to be certain. Pardon us. - Please, not his face - - No, let them. l want this on TV so everyone sees how serious the threat is. Go ahead. Hedorah got me too. Since the first tragedy in Suruga Bay, other tankers have been involved in similar accidents. Survivors say that in each case, they saw a long, dark monster. Some are calling the creature "Hedorah." HAPPY HEDORAH 'The atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb cast their fallout into the sea. Poison gas and sludge gets dumped in the ocean. Even sewage. l bet Godzilla would be mad if he saw this. Ken Yano, second grade." Darling, it's so late! Fill a test tube with that muddy seawater for me. No, you're supposed to rest. Can this really be? This tadpole is a mineral... like rocks, iron, and diamonds. Not you, too, Ken! lt's the middle of the night! Papa, Godzilla's coming. Godzilla? He's gonna come clobber Hedorah. l saw it in a dream. He'll come, right? Mama, what do you think? lf that was your dream, l'm sure he'll come. Now back to bed. Now l get it! This water contains sludge from Suruga Bay. The Hedorah tadpoles are born of sludge, just like you said. Neat-o! Look, Mama! Now these two will join together. No wonder it can grow so fast. They join when they meet. So the one l saw and the one that sank the tankers joined too. - There's no limit to how big it can get. - Bigger than Godzilla? Yes, as long as we keep polluting the ocean. We're done for if this thing ever crawls onto dry land. Could a tadpole-like creature do that? Hard to say. These things aren't in zoology textbooks. We have to do something before it's too late. The birds and the fish Where have they gone? Dragonflies and butterflies Where have they all gone? Mercury, cobalt, cadmium Lead, sulfuric acid, oxidants Cyanogen, manganese, vanadium Chrome, potassium, strontium Polluted seas Polluted skies All life is gone The fields and mountains are silent There's no one left on earth No one to even shed a tear Hedorah? Very funny! Hedorah is a sea monster! Give it all back! Give back the green trees and blue sky! Give back the blue sea Give back the sun! What's that? Godzilla! Let's get closer. Why is Godzilla here? lf they start fighting, they'll destroy the whole port. A clash between Hedorah and Godzilla has left 35 people dead, 81 people injured, and 322 buildings destroyed. ln Hedorah's wake... metal objects have been corroded as if by some form of acid. ls this terrestrial Hedorah the same monster that sank the tankers? Where did it come from? Why was Godzilla here? Many questions remain unanswered... They don't get it. Godzilla came to clobber Hedorah. Right, Papa? l've got a genius for a nephew. Doing your Godzilla impression? How are you doing? - Fine. My brother seems to think you can help. Yukio, thanks to you and Miki, we might find out what Hedorah really is. This is where it gave off sparks? That's right. Look at this. Burnt ash from the sparks. - Should l collect some? - Yes, all you can find. lt's exactly like the tadpole. So the tadpole changed shape and came on land like a frog? That's the only explanation. But are there really living creatures made solely of minerals? You're sure it emitted sparks? Yes, positive. lt was quite beautiful. And instead of eating that cat, it climbed up a smokestack and inhaled the fumes. Those fumes should be toxic to any living creature. That's it! Hedorah is unlike any life-form on Earth. The gooey colored stuff is sludge. The shiny white stuff is related to diamonds. lt's a mineral called hedrium. That's the tadpole's eyeball ground into powder. l gave it the name hedrium. l think it's the key to the monster's life force. With a body made of minerals and sludge, it wouldn't feel pain like organic creatures do. And sparks in reaction to Godzilla's breath would be expected. lf Hedorah breathes in factory fumes, wouldn't that solve our air pollution? Absolutely not. Hedorah is far more dangerous. Why did all that metal corrode? Take another look. That yellow substance is sulfur... probably the result of a catalytic reaction between hedrium and another substance. Sulfur is a component of sulfuric acid. The burns on my face resemble those caused by some such chemical. The small particles in sulfuric acid mist corrode metal. lf Hedorah consumes factory fumes and releases sulfuric acid mist... it won't clean our air. We'll be smothered in toxic smog. The appearance of Hedorah, a creature said to be born of sludge, has the entire nation on edge. Ηedorah avoids sunlight, but it could come ashore again on a rainy or foggy day. Everyone within a half mile of rivers or the ocean should be on alert, especially along industrial coastlines - Forget all this talk of Hedorah until you're better. Fine. l was just watching a little news. ANDROMEDA NEBULA Papa, if Hedorah isn't from Earth, how did it get here? SPlRAL NEBULA lN CANES VENATlCl You know what a meteorite is? A meteor that falls to Earth. M82 NEBULA AFTER A STARBURST That's right. GASEOUS NEBULA lN MONOCEROS Hedorah must have arrived on one. COMET lKEYA-SEKl l wonder what kind of planet it came from. Probably some dark, sludge-like planet. Now let's get some sleep. HORSEHEAD NEBULA, A DARK NEBULA lN ORlON We gotta get off! Careful! Uncle Yukio, l saw Godzilla. Hedorah must be here too. Not on a sunny day like this. Ken! There's no keeping up. Hello? Godzilla? lt's true! Okay. Go meet your mom at her school and come home together. Ken? What's wrong? Hello? One, two, three, four... Ma'am, my throat! What happened? lmai! Michiko! We can't stay out here! lnside, quick! Help each other inside. Gas tanks at the Japan Oil Company have exploded. Nearby residents, evacuate immediately. The fire may spread. Please evacuate immediately. lt would be faster to walk. lt's no use complaining. Something wrong? That's strange... What's that? l'm scared! Run! Ouch! ANTl-HEDORAH OXYGEN MASKS FOR SALE Southwestern Fuji City has been practically destroyed. There have been 1 ,600 casualties, and over 30,000 have been injured. Hedorah has left a trail of concentrated sulfuric acid mist of up to 2,800 ppm, burning the eyes and throats of rescue workers. Bodies are reportedly piling up in the streets. When my students started collapsing, l just - l can't teach like this! There's no telling how bad this might get. Will Hedorah get bigger and bigger? Yes, if we don't stop polluting. And as it grows, it will absorb even more pollutants and be able to go anywhere. Even climb Mount Fuji? Maybe. Ken, you know what an atomic blast is? Atomic and hydrogen bombs. That's right. When the nucleus of an atom undergoes nuclear fission... it splits into smaller nuclei, releasing tremendous energy. NUCLEAR FlSSlON OF A SlLVER ATOM ln space, there are nuclear blasts even greater than the sun. CRAB NEBULA lN TAURUS Bang! That's crazy! Hedorah may be flying on its own nuclear power. lt's a space creature made of metallic elements. Who knows what destructive power it could develop? More powerful than Godzilla? lt's possible. But there's just one Hedorah. Mankind could defeat it if we all joined forces. Can't something be done now? The next time it comes ashore, we must be ready to destroy it. lt must have a weakness somewhere. Why not dry it up? lt's just sludge. So there's Hedorah triumphant. We reap what we sow. Hedorah is a monster of our own making. A million people... Party a go-go! Pretty cool, huh? Let's gather the youth of Japan for a big party at Mount Fuji before Hedorah gets there. When Hedorah first appeared, it was a huge, tadpole-like larva that sunk one tanker after another. That was its aquatic phase. Then, one foggy night, it changed into a four-legged, amphibian-like creature... absorbing smokestack fumes to fuel its growth. That was its terrestrial phase. lt then transformed into a flying-saucer-like form and spread sulfuric acid mist over the city in broad daylight. That was its airborne phase. The question now is... what terrifying form will this monster take next? Professor, what do you think? lts growth rate is frightening. l can't make any predictions. What is Hedorah's weakness? Well... it comes from a planet where no earthly creature could survive, a dark world of death. lt emerged from toxic sludge, so oxygen might possibly deter its growth. Blast it with oxygen! Yeah! Who's responsible for Hedorah? The land and sea aren't fit for life anymore. What's the government doing? Where are the Defense Forces? Stop polluting! Halt all industry! Thank you. Here l have one positive and one negative electrode Pass an electric current through them and anything between instantly dries out. lt's being tested in Hokkaido to dry fields. Let's see if it works. - You'll use this to dry up Hedorah? - Exactly. Good. Now we just need to increase the scale. Call the Defense Forces. All Defense Forces and reserve troops have been mobilized to guard key industrial cities. The government has ordered all factories to cease production and banned the use of automobiles in urban areas. Over 1 0 million people in Tokyo, Osaka, and other major cities are suffering the effects of the sulfuric acid mist. So much for "a million people." More like a hundred! lt's no use grumbling. The good green Earth only exists in our hearts now. Let's sing! Let's dance! Let's pour our energy out into the universe! Let's do it! This is a news flash. Ηedorah is heading north after passing over the Sugura coastline. lt appears to have grown to 200 feet long. Defense Forces along the coast fired at the monster, but all attacks pass through its body with no effect. Toshie! Yes, dear? Make a phone call for me. Godzilla sent a telepathic message. He's here. That means Hedorah is too. - Are you sure? Hurray! Godzilla's here! Go, Godzilla! Defense headquarters? Have you finished those electrodes? What? They're still under construction in Sakaizawa? Hedorah's in the Mount Fuji area? Please do all you can. Ken's in danger! He's not the only one. Every living thing is. Toshie, can you take me there? Not in your condition! lf those electrodes fail, there'll be no way to stop Hedorah. This planet's survival depends on them. lt's here! lt's afraid of fire. Grab the torches! Take that, you bastard! Drop the oxygen! We're here. Are you all right? Professor, the electrodes are ready. Good. We placed the electrodes a half mile apart. They're 1 30 feet tall and 200 feet wide. You think it will come? We'll bait it with helicopters and artillery. When it's close, we'll use headlights and supersonic waves. - What's the voltage? - Three million volts. We're rerouting all electricity from the Kanto and Chubu regions here. The power lines are down! Repair them immediately! Headquarters! Halt power transmission! Unit One, report! We've lost contact. - And Unit Two? - On its way, sir. - Hurry! Here it comes. Your headlights. Use them to lure it this way. We still don't have power. Now, before it leaves! Hurry! Please. Blink your headlights! - Are those repairs done? - Almost. How much longer? Ten minutes! How far away is it now? A hundred yards. lt stopped! That idiot! lt's moving again. - Are the repairs done? - Five more minutes. There's no time! l'll give you one minute! - You have 30 seconds! - Okay! Do we have power? We need power now! We have full power! ldiot! lt's too late! They're headed this way! Now! Power up the electrodes! - Now what? - We blew a fuse. You bumbling fools! Polluted seas Polluted skies All life is gone The fields and mountains are silent There's no one left on earth No one to even shed a tear Godzilla! Godzilla, good-bye! WlLL THERE BE ANOTHER? THE END
