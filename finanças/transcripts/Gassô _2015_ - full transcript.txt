- One night, when he came home, he noticed that his sandals were wet. He thought it was strange because it was not raining, so he picked it up with his hand. He smelled a foul odor of a dead animal. He did not notice anything out of the ordinary the next morning. But that evening, he smelled the same foul odor. He wondered if this is Mat he stepped on last night. As he was going to pass the place, he saw something strange. Something unknown was rotting inside the building. On day 11 of lunar month 4, 1868, the Tokugawa shogunate's rule has ended after 300 years. Tokugawa Yoshinobu surrendered Edo Castle to the new government and confined himself in Mito. The amazing thing about this historical reform was that it was carried out by talks. And the citizens of Edo were happy about this conclusion Mich was very rare even in world history, and welcomed the new government. On the other hand, some samurai are not such ingenuous creatures... - We must regain the prestige of the Tokugawa again now! - Bastard, you are stubborn! - Shut up! = Stop! Calm down. - Those men who lost the opportunity to shed their blood and shout war cries for their cause were wandering around dangerously... GASSOH (Joint Burial) - Madam! Young master! The lord is... - Are you saying that I should kill Yuzuki-dono? But, instead of discussing our private grudge, we should follow the inspector's direction now... - Is it just a private grudge? How disgraceful... Masanosuke, you are scared. I understand. The Kasai family that has lasted eight generations is finished now. It was unwise for us to adopt a man like you as our son. We can only apologize to our ancestors with our death now. - Praise to Amida Buddha! Praise to Amida Buddha! - Just watch the end of my mother and myself. Mother, shall we? - Mother! Ah, mother! Please stop. - I wish you good luck with your battle. - I wish you success for carrying out your objective. - Don't laugh! - Same to you! - Please consider that. - I accept. - Ah! Brother! It is outrageous. Please reconsider. - Teijiro, Akitsu's determination is firm. It is best for both families. - Brother! - I appreciate your consideration. I will be back some other time. - Wait! Kiwamu! - Excuse me! - Miss... - Kiwamu! Hey! Kiwamu! Hey! Say something. - If you want your sister in the Akitsu family, I have a younger brother, Shizuru. I will let him meet her soon. - That's not what I am talking about! What about my sister's feelings? She has believed you would many her since she was a young child. - It is Teijiro! And Kiwamu? - Revenge? Are you going to? - Why would I? - So you have not done it yet? - Well, I am just an adopted son anyway. - But he is still your father. Is it all right with you? Your mother must be in distress after her husband was murdered. - My mother is relieved. - Huh? - They did not get along at all. And my mother knows that I would not really do it either. That was a way for her to get rid of an nuisance. They adopted me for a down'. They were going to kick me out someday anyway. By the way, what were you guys fighting about? - Kiwamu broke off the engagement with my sister. - Huh? - He is going to let his younger brother succeed as the head of the family, and he is leaving the family. - Why? - I am asking that too. What are you going to do after leaving the family? Ha! Why are you wearing your hair like that? Is it some kind of evidence for your fidelity? - Evidence for fidelity... - So... You are eloping with some other woman? - That's right. It is my evidence for fidelity. - Bastard! - Bu! no! for a woman. It is for the Tokugawa family. - Kiwamu, are you still with the "Shogitai?" (League to Demonstrate Righteousness) - Indeed, I am. I am going to sustain a siege in Ueno. - Ridiculous! The Shogitai was originally organized to protect the shogun. And the shogun surrendered Edo Castle. There is no ostensible reason for the Shogitai to aggregate in Ueno. It is quite absurd for you to leave the family and join the Shogitai. - That was an impressive speech. Your studying in Nagasaki paid off. - Don't mock me. - I made my mind up yesterday. - When the lord is disgraced, vassals must restore with their lives. When the lord is disgraced, vassals must restore with their lives. When the lord is disgraced, vassals must restore with their lives. When the lord is disgraced, vassals must restore with their lives. When the lord is disgraced, vassals must restore with their lives. When the lord is disgraced, vassals must... - You did it again. You always have done that. And I don't like it. You should not run away from an argument when you can't convince. You should try to explain with reasons. Or the person you are speaking to would never be satisfied. The Shogitai is just a white elephant now. Since the shogun has shown his intention of submission, the Shogitai should follow the shogun and work toward the reform with talks. Hey! Wait! I am not done talking. Wait! Hey! - Please come this way. Let me take it. - Oh... Photography... - Hey! Why don't you join me in the photograph? I'm paying for it. - I refuse. - Would it make your life shorter? - Idiot, I don't believe in such superstition. - Oh! Look! - Masanosuke - Huh? Oh... - Is this how? - No, this is the way. - No, let me take it. Let me... This is how. - Really? - What is that stance? I do this way. - I do this way. - Bang! - Because of this bad weather today, it will take a little longer. So please be patient. - Why don't you join the corps? - Huh? - You can't go back to your home now. - Let's begin. Now. Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. - How is this? - What is this? - This? My father's keepsake. - You can't kill men with that. - Is that right? - It would break when it hits the bone. I will get you some money from the corps, so get something better. - What do you want? Introduce yourself! - I am a former personal attendant to the shogun, Fukuhara Kazue's younger brother, Teijiro. I am hereto see Akitsu Kiwamu in the 18th squad. - Go ask at the Shun-shoin in Yanakamon. - Excuse me... Excuse me! Is Akitsu in the 18th squad here? - Akitsu? - Yes. - He is patrolling the city now. Patrolling is a vital duty for the corps, because there are more disturbances in the city now. - Please let me make an ill mannered request. I want you to let Akitsu leave the corps. - Akitsu... He saw the shogun off, didn't he? - I think so. - You should give that up. - Huh? - Those men are impossible. They only think about dying. Leaving that aside, do you want to join the corps? - With all due respect, I have no interest. - Oh... - Yes, with all due respect... As long as the Shogitai stay on here in Ueno, the new government would be annoyed. Are you going to start another war? His Excellency left the city of Edo undamaged, but his vassals would burn it down? That is absurd. That is truly absurd. - That is really absurd. The main mission of the corps is to clear the false accusations aimed at the shogun. That is the only thing. But the number of members increased too much. Now it passed 3,000. So it can be seen as that kind of force. Naturally some men want to start a war. That opinion suddenly got stronger when the shogun confined himself. And Akitsu is one of those men. - Idiot... - Huh? - Just because he saw the shogun off, he may have thought that he had become a close immediate vassal of the shogun. He lost his head. He has been like that for a longtime. - Well, I want a debater like you. We need someone who can restrain the corps' accidental firing from within. Can you see that? - Oh... - They are back. - We are back. - We are back, Mari-sari. - Thank you. - Mori-san, please take us out to drink tonight. - Hey, you shouldn't say that. - What a nerve you have... - Fine! Akitsu, Yoshimori... - Yes. - Bring that friend with you. Listen, starting a war is not the corps' interest. As soon as the domain of His Excellency is setup, we must immediately dissolve and follow our lord and show our submission. - But, why do we have to make a concession to villainous Satsuma-Choshu? - Yes, indeed! We don't need to hold ourselves back to Satsuma-Choshu at all. = Yes, indeed! - Now is the time the corps should rise and deal with them with power. = Yes, indeed! - Teijiro... - That was inexcusable! - How rude! - Satsuma-Choshu is villainous? - Stop! - What do you mean? - Stop! Don't draw your swords! - You can't draw even if you want to. You punks cam' fake swords. Come on! Can you see this sword? - Move! You're getting in the way! - How foolish! Move the dead body to the Kan-shoin. Then go back to headquarters and stay there. = Yes. - Don't dawdle! - How is he? - We were told that he just got bruises and we don't need to worry. - Is that right? - It is all my fault. I was petrified with terror. And he told me to watch out. - I am glad that he is all right. - Thank you. Well... - Yes. - Do you live in this house? - Yes, my name is Kana. And you are... - Ah, yes. I am Yoshimori Masanosuke. - Is that right? - Yes. - Well... - Yes. - And this man here is... - Ah, you are awake now. What's the matter? Does it still hurt? - I must have been very disgraceful. Please laugh at me. - We are sorry for your trouble. - You were disgraceful. - What are you doing here? - That was close. Wait a minute. I want to hear your opinion. About yesterday... - What is it? - Kiwamu confronted a Satsuma-Choshu man with swords last night. There was a waitress there at that time. And Kiwamu warned the waitress. Kiwamu must have said "Move out of the way," but the waitress remembered that he told her to "Watch out." I think my memory is more accurate. What do you think? - What are you talking about? - So if Kiwamu said "Move out of the way" or "Watch out." - Who knows? I don't remember things like that. - Your skill has declined. You may have studied a lot in Nagasaki, but you are useless here with that fencing skill. If you understand that, go away. I would never go home no matter what you say. - Don't be conceited. I am not here for you. - Then why are you here? - I am here for Mori-san. - What? - Mori-san is struggling to restrain you men from losing control of yourselves. I just want to help him. - Mori... - What? - Mori is just a coward. He is a convenient man because we can coax him into paying for things. - Bastard! - Mori is a coward. Do you have any objections? - No, no objections, but how can you talk about someone who has been so kind... - Mori did not see His Excellency off. - So what? - You should have seen him off too. - Yes, indeed. Then you would feel the same as we do. - Only those who have seen him off can understand. Nothing would make me happier than if! could sacrifice my life for you. Your Excellency... - Hey! - Hello, sir. - It is timely to find you, Yoshimori. - Yes. - Put these in a vase. I just feel gloomy. I thought that ﬂowers may help. - Hello, sir. Hello, sir. - The Tokugawa family declared that it has nothing to do with the Shogitai at all and left its disposal to the new government. No longer is a war inevitable. Now the hawkish faction will desperately try to crush us. You men should leave the corps as soon as possible. - What would happen to the men? - You should recommend those who do not want the war to leave the corps. - What about those who want the war? - That would not be our responsibility. - But they will die in vain. - Who cares! We are in danger ourselves. - Mori, listen... That would not be our responsibility. HAIR COSMETIC OIL POWDER HAIR COSMETIC OIL POWDER - Welcome. HAIR COSMETIC OIL POWDER HAIR COSMETIC OIL POWDER -Ah... HAIR COSMETIC OIL POWDER HAIR COSMETIC OIL POWDER - What are you looking for? - What are you looking for? - Ah... A hair ornament for my younger sister... - Yes, how old is she? - Ah... How old would she be? She can't be older than me, so... - That's true. - Yoshimori-sama... - Ah, it is... - Well... I need to ask you a favor. - Yes. - Would you give these to Akitsu-sama? - Kana... - Yes. Thank you. "I could not contain my feelings anymore, so I am secretly writing this letter to you. "I deeply respect your resolution to devote yourself to the Shogitai, "and admire you from afar." "Sincerely, "to Akitsu Kiwamu-sama from Kana." - Hey! We are going to party tonight. - Where? - In Fukagawa... Since we are dying anyway, the group leader gave us money. - Ah... Here! A good luck charm... - I don't want it! I don't cam' things like that. - There was a huge camphor tree within the grounds of this temple. One night, a drunk man was sleeping at the base of this tree. When he woke up, the tree root he was using as a pillow was warm like human ﬂesh. When he put his ear on the trunk of the tree... Since then, the man came to sleep at the tree even' night. = The man never married and let the second son... - ..succeed the family business. - This is a stow I heard from my uncle. There was this mother. Whenever she combed her hair, her baby started to cw. - When she combed her hair? - That's right. Even though the baby was owing, the mother kept combing her hair. Then she suddenly noticed that the baby stopped owing. The mother hurriedly looked at the baby. The baby's hair grew just as long as the mother's. - Was it that scam? - Yes. It is really difficult for me to listen to these stories. - I know a similar stow, but mine is more scan'. - No, please stop. - Go ahead and talk. - When the mother came to her senses, her own hair was frightfully long. Then she noticed that something was tangled with her hair. She timidly looked at it. Her hair was coiled around the baby's neck and the baby was dead. - There! " Stop! Please ignore her. She really likes to get attention that way. - Then let me tell a stow. - Are you telling that stow? - That's right. This is something that happened to me. ' No! - Kozato! Please continue. - This happened just yesterday. I was sleeping at the station house. The shogun was standing by me. - Ridiculous! - Don't say things like that! - But he was really standing there. ' Doppelganger? - But why did he go to Kiwamu? - I don't know. Maybe my devotion is too strong. I could not open my eyes. I could not be given an audience in the state I was in. I am determined to sacrifice my life for His Excellency. Therefore this sword was given to me. When the time comes, I will not hesitate to use this sword... - She sounds like a cat. - Ah...! Is this for me? This is a high quality piece... In contrast to your appearance, you are a savvy playboy. - Fencing is really nothing. It is just a matter of how much you practice. But those who spend time in debauchery are conceited and say things like they would beat the new government's force. That is quite absurd. Fencing skills don't matter anymore. Studying is more important. You shouldn't throw away your lives in vain. You must keep living and study. That is the real direction and the truthful way of living. - Mori-sama, excuse me for asking, but what are you here for? - I just came to talk. I am not going to negotiate. I just came to talk. - Sir... - Excuse me. First of all, we should suppress the fits of passion and make our objective and the plan clear. Right now, we don't have any strategy and what we will be doing is ambiguous. About the form and the nature of the corps... - You... You are sitting there without any weapon. We can kill you anytime we want. And you are giving us a lecture?! What did you come here for? - I am afraid to say this, but we have no chance of winning the battle. But at least, I want to let them fight evenly. It is too pitiful for the men to be slaughtered like stray dogs. - Leave the corps as soon as you can. You are needlessly stirring up the course of the corps. You are the one who is the most obstructing to the corps. - Boorish samurai! - Huh? - Who is that so late at night? - How many did you get? - Just one. - Is that all? - Kiwamu, how many? Oh! - Did you get that many today? That's great. - They will paint a portrait of you someday. - What's the matter? - Where is the sound coming from? - I don't know. - It is nice. - It is nonsense... - What is? - Everything is... Things are so outrageous. - You have had a lot tonight. Let's stop now. - No, no. I just can't get drunk. - You are already drunk enough. - Excuse me. Men from the corps are here. - Come in. You are from the 8th squad? - Yes, we need to talk to you, Mori-san. - I see. Sit down. Madam... - Yes. - Phase prepare some (uni - Yes, it will be ready right away. - Why don't you sit down? - Madam! Madam! - Mori-sama! Mori-sama! Someone! Someone get a doctor! - Idiot! Your imprudence has never been corrected. What were you excited about this time? - I am sorry. But I would never go back to the corps. The man who was (wing to prevent a war has been assassinated by men from the corps. I think that a war will begin. Akitsu Kiwamu and Yoshimori Masanosuke will die. - This is from Manabe Sensei in Nagasaki. You should go back to Nagasaki as soon as possible. Idiot... - What are you looking at? - I am hoping that the Shogitai would walk by. - You didn't know? The Shogitai's duty of patrolling the city was taken away. - Huh? So they don't patrol anymore? - No, they don't. - This is the Satsuma-Choshu man. So Satsuma-Choshu will come get it sooner or later. - Wait, we have not eaten yet. - You have not eaten? - No. - Sony, I finished all. - Look at it. It is your fault because you were not here. - What is it? What is it? Just for a meal? = Hey! = Stop in = Hey, stop it. - Ozeki-sama? - Yes. I am going to many Ozeki-sama. - Are you all right with that? - He is much older, but he is a very gentle man. But... But... I want to see him for the one last time. I have not really talked to him since when we were little children, but I have admired him in my heart for a longtime. He broke off the engagement, so I know that he does not love me. But I still want to see him and say good bye at least. - Kana-dono, it is very hard for me to tell you this, but... Kana-dono, it is very hard for me to tell you this, but Akitsu Kiwamu has a favorite prostitute as his lover whom he sees regularly. I found this. TO: AKITSU KIWAME-SAMA I found this. TO: AKITSU KIWAME-SAMA ASAGIRI ASAGIRI This Asagiri is the prostitute. This Asagiri is the prostitute. And Akitsu is with her now in broad daylight in Fukagawa. Kana-dono, it is very hard for me to tell you this, but... I found this. - You were in Fukagawa in broad daylight? That is extravagant. - What do you want? - I came to ask you for one last favor. Please see Sayo. - I refuse. - I beg you. - I can't accept. Stop it. - I am not stopping. I gave up. Now I know that I don't have any power to change people's minds. I am going back to Nagasaki. But at least I want to make Sayo's wish come true before I go. - The war is starting! The war is starting. The hill is surrounded by the government force. The war is finally starting! - The war is starting! The war is starting! - Teijiro, go back. - Hurry! - You guys go over there. = Yes. - Come to your senses. Kiwamu is here. Kiwamu! Kiwamu! - You are back... Come! - Bring them quickly! Hurry! " Teijiro! What are you doing? - As you can see, I am preparing for the battle. - But you must go back to Nagasaki. - I tried to stop, but he wouldn't listen. - We are done with that argument. I... I will not let you two die alone. - Hurry! SHOGITAI SHOGITAI SHOGITAI SHOGITAI SHOGITAI SHOGITAI SHOGITAI SHOGITAI SHOGITAI SHOGITAI SHOGITAI SHOGITAI - Everyone be ready tomorrow to fight bravely as warriors! - Everyone be ready tomorrow to fight bravely as warriors! = Yes! - Artillery fire will go over your heads, but you will charge boldly with swords! = Yes! - Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! - Hurry! - What do we do? - I will out his head off. If we leave him here, he will be mutilated by the enemy with their swords. - Kiwamu, leave the head behind. - No way. You go first! - Kiwamu! Kiwamu! - Where is this? - I don't know. We sneaked in for the time being. - What is the battle status? - I don't know. But since there is no artillery fire, they may be done for the night. - You... have never changed your sword till the end. - Huh? - I know that you bought a hair ornament with that money. That woman in Fukagawa... What was the name? That prostitute... - Ah...! Is this for me? This is a high quality piece... fr? contrast your appearance, you are a savvy playboy. Well, shall I tell a story? This young man loved the war chronicles and read them all day long. One day, as he was reading a war chronicle as usual, a strange sound was heard. The sound came from the tea cup. - Kiwamu, are you all right? Kiwamu... Please stop. Please stop! - I can't take it anymore. Please finish me. - I can't... - What happened? - Good luck. - Thank you very much. - Mr. Samurai, this was with the kimono of the deceased man. - Two months after the war, on the 17th day of lunar month 7, 1868, the new government changed the name of the city from Edo to "Tokyo" (Eastern Capital). And on the 8th day of lunar month 9, it changed the name of an era to Meiji. - Hey... Stop such a foolish thing. Don't misunderstand me. I am not accusing you of anything. I am a carefree man, more than you may think. Maybe it is because of my age. I was probably more captious when I was younger. Well, we became husband and wife by fate. You should talk about it if you can. I think that will erase any ill feelings and make things better for each other. What do you say? - Please forgive me. I am really a sinful woman. - Huh? - It was my fault that my brother died. I lied to my brother. My brother died believing that lie. - Don't worry. Tell me. - One month before the war in Ueno, it was the night of a half moon. I woke up suddenly. Is this a dream? Kiwamu-sama... - Sorry, lam leaving soon. - No, you cannot... - The moon brought me here. The moon and [he ﬂute... - ﬂute .7 - Someone was playing it.
