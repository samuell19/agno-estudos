I actually like that jacket. It would look better on me. I can't believe you're my brother. Why are we stopping? Remember Zoey, our cousin? She bit you at my birthday party, and you peed your pants. That's what happens when you're six and afraid. Well, her parents got divorced so she moved here. All right, switch me, dude. I don't want to sit next to that flesh eater, she's crazy. Hey, there she is. You know what? We're good. Thanks for the ride. Walking is way too athletic for me. You're... - Hi. - You're Josh, right? You bit me... I... When we were kids. - Oh! Yeah, yeah. - You... Well, in my defense, I think you took the last piece of cake or something. What are you listening to? Is that lovelytheband? - You like them? - Yeah. Are you kidding me?

That's... that's your new plan? A mix? You don't understand because you don't believe in love. Ah, I forgot. I can't feel human emotion. How do you know you're in love? You feel it, dweeb. Did you call me a dweeb? Look, you're never, ever gonna get anywhere unless you tell her how you feel. What are you so afraid of? Nothing, man. It's just... Joshua torres, please report to Mr. Elmer's office immediately. Oh, don't worry, man. Elmer loves me. I hate you. Thank you? Do you have something for me? I... have a protein bar in my locker, yes. I mean your final essay, smartass. You're the only one who's missing from this stack. And now I'm late for a backgammon tournament. And from what I hear, it's, um, like how you say, "turned"? Okay, look, Mr. Elmer, I just need a little bit more time, you know, but you're gonna love it. I got these beautiful chapters and illustrations. It's looking pretty nice. I don't need "lord of the rings." I just need ten pages answering the question, "how was your high school experience?" Yes, I just need some more time. Time? High school's over. I mean, it's not over over. We still have three more weeks. - It's over. - Is it, though? It is. Yeah, but a lot of interesting things can happen in the next three weeks. I'm talking life-changing events that can completely change my whole high school experience. Okay, have you seen "fireworks at beaumont" with Patrick j. Michaels? Uh, uh... It's a classic '80s movie. He spends all of senior trying to get with the prettiest girl and it's not until the very last day of school that... that there's this beautiful concert. And he grabs the guitar, and then boom, it happens. And she falls in love with him at the end. It happens. It will happen. I can't describe my high school experience yet because it's not over. It can't be. Okay. Get me the essay by Sunday. Sunday, that's in a few days. Yeah, that's me giving you a break, okay? If you don't turn it in, you're not gonna graduate. And your real high school experience will be spent in summer school with me. That's not a fun essay to write. I can't write your paper, man. I gotta spend my weekend looking for food trucks. What? Yeah, Donnie wants to get into the grilled cheese business before graduation. So, you know, I don't know much, but I do know this... Chicks don't dig cheese. It's a fungus. Just tell Donnie how you feel. No! Uh, yeah, I'm outside. No, I'm not gonna walk to Starbucks. Because it's raining! I will see you here. Thanks. - Hi. - What's up, cuz? Hi. Oh, oh, did you hear? The closing act at front and center this year will be lovelytheband. - No way. - Yeah, they just announced it. My friend Liz went last year. She said it was like totally lit. I would kill for wristbands, but they sold out in like two minutes, it's insane. Oh, wait. Okay, gotta go. Uh, I'm coming, Kale. My chaturanga was unbelievable. Oh, as always. Kale. Can't be his real name. It's short for Kaleb, I think. What does she even see in the guy? Are you kidding? - What's up, cam? - Hey, Kale. His name could be catheter and she'd still wanna date him. Semantics, Michael. Look, he'll be out of the picture in no time. - I have a plan. - Oh, there's a shocker. An insanely great plan, bro. I literally have no plan. About Zoey? No, about Mr. Elmer. I mean, how am I supposed to write an essay in one weekend? - It's unfair. - Dude, seriously? No, I'm 100% team Elmer here. Why don't you just finish it? Well... We're late for work. You've been on it for a year now. You really need to pull the trigger. It's hard to get her attention. Her? Aren't we still talking about Elmer? No, we're talking about Zoey. Well, I don't know. Here's a crazy idea. Maybe you just walk up to her in a heartfelt way, say "I like you. Do you like me?" "I like you, you like me?" Really? I can't say that. She has a boyfriend. I don't care what anyone says, this still holds up. - Oh, totally. - How many times do you think we've seen this movie since we were kids? Probably like a million. Okay, so would Patrick j. Michaels be afraid of his crush, having a girlfriend? No, no, he'd plant his flag in the ground and take a beating in the name of love. Shut up! Aren't you supposed to be working? Go back to sleep, Jared! Rude. Mm, mm-mm. This part always makes me nervous. I love you, Brittany. I always have. And I always will. ♪ We only have tonight my, my, my love... ♪ The music, the fireworks, I mean, that... That is how a first kiss is supposed to be. Mm-hmm. I so doubt she was homeschooled. Dude, come on. One of us at least has got to have our fireworks-on-the-dock moment. You're right. I need to be more like Patrick j. Freakin' Michaels. - Yes, you do. - Okay, I could play her that mix that I've been working on. - Oh, that's such a good idea. - Yeah. I mean, high school's almost over. It's now or never, goosie. It's Friday-bye-day, and I'm very curious what Zoey has to say. Um, well, actually, today's lunch would be a literal Friday-bye-day for me because.. I am graduating early and moving to Los Angeles. - For reals? - Yeah. ♪ You make me so, so sad ♪ ♪ I'm talking waterfall ♪ ♪ You make me so, so sad... ♪ - Josh? - Josh? L.A.! Can you believe it? I really can't. How about you, Josh? Um, when are you moving out? Uh, I don't know. Two or three... - Weeks? - Days, actually. Yeah, I know, it all happened like really fast. Kale got a job at an art gallery... Well, he's going too? Yeah, yeah, we are moving in together. We'll see how that goes. Wow, and aunt Marie is cool with that? Uh, no, no, not at all. Phenomenal instincts, that woman. Well, it's not really up to her, I'm 18. If she can live with her annoying boyfriend, I can live with mine, too. Not that Kale is annoying or anything. Besides, maybe this is like a good opportunity for me to like further develop my art, you know? Your art? What, what art? I think it's a bold move, cuz. - Thank you. - Okay. Zoey, how do you know you're not making a mistake? Well, how do I know that I'm not making the right decision? 'Cause it's a mistake! Wow, you would really get along well with my mom. Hey, Zoey. Come on. Hey. Uh, I'll see you later, guys. I'll miss you. That was good. I like that. Especially the part where you tell her that her dreams and aspirations are a mistake. Freakin' British people, dude, with their accents. It's like their superpower or something. It's UN... it's unfair. Well... there's not much to say. That's my in-between-the-knees pillow, and I sleep in the nude. What is wrong with you? Nothing. You should try it. It's insanely breezy. It's that redcoat Kale, man. He's a bad influence on her, I'm telling you. He's an artist, so now she wants to be an artist? Zoey's been into art since she was a kid. What is this? Texas a&m? The housing department? You're leaving me, too? No, I'm not. I just wanted optics, but it's out of state, man. I can't afford it. And I can't just move across the country and abandon my brother. It's been the two of us for... Forever and... You gotta be kidding me. Check it out, boys! Don't say anything about a&m. Donnie, buddy! Thought you were gonna wait for me. Yeah, well, there was another buyer and, you know, had to take it. There was another buyer for this. Uh-huh, yeah, no. She needs work. But trust me, she's a gem. Uh... you can fix that, right? So I'm thinking about names. The milleni-yum falcon. Y-u-m. Right? Mm. You can be Chewie. I don't want to be Chewie. All right, I'm gonna let you guys figure it out. I gotta get to work. Why wouldn't you want to be Chewie? Why wouldn't you want to be Chewie? 'Cause I'm the roguish one. Maybe Mikey's right. Maybe I should just move on. What? Heck no! If you let this damsel that you've been distressing over leave before you have a chance to profess your true feelings, then, then you will wind up a shell of man forever haunted by the cruel ghost of "what if." But she's leaving in two days. Who wants wristbands to see lovelytheband at front and center? That's right, big Joe Henry here giving away two wristbands to the first caller. - So call now. - Call! Faster! Buttons, push them! - And we have a winner. - Ahhh... - Congrats to Matt baker. - Ohh! Cancel whatever you're doing this weekend, Matt, because you're going to front and center. - Baker! - Ugh! Man, lovelytheband, front and center? That would've been a date to remember. I mean, the romance would have been off the charts. Gah! It sucks for you. - Hello? - Hey, dude, um... My... my boss's son has food poisoning, something about discount Sushi. Cool. Why don't you grab a pen and the paper and add that to the list of things I don't care about? He had three tickets to front and center - and he gave them to me. - What? - Get out. - Yes, yes. And if we leave by tonight, we can make it to lovely by Sunday night, we just need some wheels, bro. - Yeah, leave that to me. - Sweet. And you just gotta help me convince Zoey to come with us. Dude, no! Why? Why? Price of admission. Meet me in an hour. You're the worst. This is good. This is really good. Dude, that wasn't even like a white lie, that was like a full-on Lance Armstrong. This is bad. Oh crap, this is really bad. I'm gonna cancel this whole thing, what've done? Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, you can't do that. Look, you set into motion something big, okay? Zoey's not gonna say no to lovelytheband, and plus, it's a road trip. With friends, just like in the movies. When are we leaving? We? Babe, do you think we should exhibit this at the gallery, or do you think we should save it for, like, above our bed? Babe? Have you seen my sketchbook? What is your jacket doing on my sketchbook? I like to take a peek once in a while and give some advice, that's all. But you know that I don't like to show my stuff - when it's not ready. - I know you feel threatened when you're surrounded by real art. But you can get to this level, too, babe. It just takes time. I mean, look. That piece there took me nine years. That one stripe there took me a solid month. Okay, can you just get over yourself for a hot second? I am sensing something very awry in your aura. Yes. Yes, my aura is very awry. We're not even close to being ready to leave tomorrow. And I don't know, is the move too soon? And, and maybe I should like, look into local art programs - or something... - Ooh! Artists don't need uni. You don't learn art, you... - You live it. - You live it. Look, do you think they could've taught me that in school? Hell to the no. I was eating frosted flakes one morning and then, boom, it hit me. The cereal killers collection. Bedroom. Okay... - Let's go! - Shh! You're gonna wake up your parents! Oh, don't worry about them. They're in Colombia attending a symposium on the neuroscience of perception. Then why did you sneak out? Oh, 'cause I've always wanted to do that. - Why are we whispering? - I don't know. But I kind of like it now. Oh, you are totally not going to regret me coming along. Little known fact, I'm an amazing wingman. Woman. Wing woman. What? No way, for real? The milleni-yum falcon at your service. Dude, Donnie let you take this? Yeah! Yeah, I just left him a nice little note explaining everything and we're cool. Whoa, we're going in this thing? - Mm-hmm. - Consider tone set. - Hi, Molly. - Hey. I thought you only had three wristbands. Oh, I bought my own. Yeah, months ago. Dig me some lovelytheband, am I right? Yeah, yeah. There's nothing weird about that, so... And I'm going to be documenting the whole experience. Hey, did you get a hold of Zoey? Yeah, man, she's on her way right now. She's gonna confess her love for y... No, I haven't talked to her. She was at Kale's 22 minutes ago. You guys have heard of social media, right? It's a thing, yeah? Good job, molls. All right, let's roll! Gotcha! And we're screwed. "I borrowed the truck, brb next week." How is next week "brb"? That was the nice note you left him? Mikey, we're supposed to be working on the truck all weekend. Yeah, but Josh got wristbands to front and center. What? Donnie, I'm sorry, bro, we only have three wristbands. I don't even think Zoey's coming. Donnie can just use her wristband. We haven't even talked to her, man. Semantics, Michael. Okay, the semantics are she's not going. You're not going, you... You're definitely not going. No one's going in my truck. Get out! Out, now! I have an extra wristband. Yep, yes, I bought two and I could sell Donnie the extra wristband. And who are you? Oh, I'm sorry, where are my manners? My name's Molly. Molly Jenkins. Some would say a wingman extraordinaire. - Woman. Woman. - Yeah, I got it, Molly Jenkins. So how much for the wristband? How about a falcon ride's worth? You know what's great about front and center? The music, but that's not what you're going to say. The food trucks, Mikey. Food trucks as far as the eye can see. I'm in, I'm in. - All right. - See, I told you, I'm an amazing wingwoman. Wait, wait, my bike! We've been packing for eight hours, this is the perfect recipe for a small mental breakdown. Okay, well, maybe if you would've helped me packed instead of talking about your stupid painting all night, I would be less stressed. Take that back. You know what? I will not let this portal of negativity enter my new la flat. It's called an apartment, Kale. We are not in London. If I wanna be cultured and call it a flat, I will call it a flat because it's flat! You need to take a savasana, work on your energy. What! What? Zoey, come on! Let's go! Zoey, come on! Come on, let's go! ♪ Yeah, baby, I'll be there yeah, baby, I'll be there ♪ We'll be back in a few days. But we committed to hot springing on the way to L.A. Well, apparently I need to work on my energy, so... See you Monday. Do schedules mean nothing to you? Wow! Man, you finally got it! - This looks like a... - Garbage can with paint. Yeah, yeah, it does. Hey, I can't believe you got wristbands for this thing. I know, trust me, I can't believe it either. - That's crazy. - Yeah. Insane, right? - Hi, I'm Zoey. - I know. I mean, I don't. I don't know, because we've never met and I've never heard anything about you. All right, guys ready? Let's go. All right. Uh, thank you for inviting me. You know, I'm like obsessed with lovelytheband. Oh, I know. I've seen the inside of your locker. In passing. You know I can just switch places with Molly if you want. - No, no, no, no, it's... - No! No! No, I'm, um, there's these puppies. What's that? Uh, it's a sketchbook. Cool, what're you doing? Sketching. Um, would you want to see? Yeah, is that cool? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, cool. This is amazing. Like professional level amazing. I had no clue you were so talented. I mean, what on earth... Oh, no, that's like, that's a work in progress. I don't normally show people my stuff, but if everyone reacts like you then maybe I have a shot in L.A., huh? I mean, I think you have a shot anywhere. Doesn't have to be L.A. You know, the local college has - a pretty good art program. - No, no, no, no. You don't learn art, you live it. I mean, unless you're caravaggio or Da Vinci, or any of the other masters who've pretty much spent their lives studying, like, right out of the womb. Or not. You know, I'm not doing it for him, right? The whole move for Kale, it's not like a chasing a guy thing. That's not what this is about. I didn't say you were. I want to become an artist. I think you're already an artist. That's really sweet of you. - Really, I'd be fine if we switched places. - No! No, no, no. - It's totally cool with me. - Just, um... "How was your high school experience?" "Well, to be honest, I haven't had many worth writing about." "But like I said, high school isn't over yet." Are we planning on eating anytime soon? We're getting hangry. Pull over, dude. Literally anywhere. Here you go. Carnival food for breakfast, great. Corn dogs are breakfast food. It's like pancakes and sausage. Hey, hey, hey, okay, so, I found a guy with wristbands. What? Molls, you're incredible. Are you serious? - You're welcome. - Yeah. So, where do we meet this guy of yours? The motel mermaid. You know, it's close to the festival. I think we'd be idiots if we didn't stay there. Looks cheap. I'm in. Hey, Molly, you want to like, hit the ring toss or something? - Scope out the carnies? - Love me some carnie scoping. All right. Now, see, that is why I never joined varsity anything. Although there was like a hot second when I was on the cheer squad 'cause of the cute outfits. Uh, so, home school? What's that like? Uh, it's rigorous work, yeah. Wake up at 4:00 A.M. every morning, and I milk the cows, I churn the butter, et cetera, et cetera. Okay. So, so, so what're you gonna do after high school? You gonna like, reject the system, build a community garden, all that? Yeah, no, totally. Yeah, I mean, the parents might not be for that idea. But me? Phew. No, actually I'm probably just gonna go to the local college, my dad teaches there, and major in psychology. Wow, that's actually really cool. You are full of surprises. I am. Watch this. Did any of those land? - No... - None whatsoever... - We suck at this. - We do. Although, we're doing much better than they are. Ah, yeah. - They need some help. - Okay, so are you related to them on their mom's side or their dad's side? Uh, mom's, thank god. - Dad was a creeper. - I heard. Did he really run off with that woman right after the mom passed away? I mean, that's, that's messed up. Yeah, no, he did. How did you know about that? Oh, I heard it from Josh. Oh yeah, Josh and I, we tell each other everything. Sometimes he tells me too much, quite frankly, you know? - Darts? - Darts. Did she see? Yeah, man, she just canceled the move. All right, let me take a whack at it. And after this, we gotta hit the road, that wa... Ohh... Mikey, we gotta get leds, man, it'll look like we're jumping into hyper drive... Guys? If he could marry that food truck, he would. Bro, at some point, you're gonna have to tell him - how you feel. - Oh, yeah, sure. Soon as you tell Zoey how you feel, I'll tell Donnie. Everyone that's been passing through here has been wanting this prize, and you could have it for free if you ride the Ferris wheel with me. Oh, hey. Hey, Zoey, can I give it a shot? Oh, I didn't know the lady was spoken for. - Oh, no. - Oh, we're not... Hey there, mister, you know what'd be great? Is getting this man some darts. - Three tries. - Okay. - That was terrible. - It was my first try. - Excuse you. - Excuse me? Uh... You, uh, you ain't from around here, are you? Yeah, we can show you around. Uh, no thank you. Some of our friends are throwing a party tonight. Look, I'm not interested, okay? Thank you. Have a nice day.

I mean, I've just always been fascinated with behavior, and people say that I have like this skill to read people, so... That does not surprise me. All right, come on, young Freud, read me. Uh, no. No, no, no, no... - What? - 'Cause people usually get offended when I do it. For example, I read my aunt belle once, and it kind of ruined Thanksgiving. She threw a 40 at me. She totally missed, by the way. But it was after I told her that alcohol was negatively affecting her life, so whatever. Oh now, come on, now you gotta read me. Psychoanalyze me until I cry. Okay. But, um... Don't say I... I didn't warn you. Okay. You market yourself like this extroverted dream girl, but deep down, you're sick of it, the people calling you beautiful because you know they're just talking about the surface and... Like every girl ever, there's so much more to you than that. But you don't advertise your real talents, like your art. And maybe it's because it's on a brand or you're afraid that people won't like your work, which will leave you feeling unappreciated. So instead, you fill that void with superficial relationships with older, seemingly self-assured guys. And you know this isn't healthy, but you tell yourself it's whatever, because at the end of the day, you're aware that you're doing it. But soon, you're gonna find yourself stuck living under the cloud of someone else's dream, convincing yourself to do things that you never wanted to do in the first place, like move in with Kale. Or not. Sorry, uh... Half the time, I don't know what I'm talking about. It's a good thing I don't have a 40. Okay... All right, you gotta give me something. Preferably a long list of your screw-ups so I don't feel bad about myself. Well, I don't have much in terms of dating. Uh, and by not much, I mean, like nonexistent. I've never even kissed a guy. Oh, shut up. What? Why? Why? Uh, I just... Okay, I... I think a first kiss should... - Should be kind of a big deal. - Okay and I want the whole shebang, you know? Like, like I want a romantic setting, underneath the stars, and a twinkle in my eye that signals that we're supposed to kiss and... And then magical fireworks explode. - Is that all? - Yeah. Okay, well, now it's my turn to read you. You overthink things. With the right guy, it's not like, about all the fireworks and stuff. Um, turn. But you and Josh, you guys seem super close. What? - No, no, no. - What? Not that there's anything wrong with Josh, because he, he is great. And, you know, now that I think about it, he's kind of cute, right? And I mean, ooh, you should see him at matinee time. Woof. Can't keep those geriatrics off of him, if you know what I'm sayin'? - Yeah, Josh is sweet. - Yeah. Where did you find this place? Did you know this was happening? I did not. There you guys are. Oh, hey, okay, so, wristband... What? Uh, nothing. It's too much, right? Like this, this hair thing, - and the sparkles... - No, no, it's... It's nice. - Um, the wristbands. - Yes, all right. So he is going to text me when he gets here. I think you should give me the money now that way you can just like, focus. Yeah. These are my savings. Where'd you meet this guy? - Oh, craigslist. - Craigslist? - What're we waiting for? - Let's go party! Mikey, Mikey, I found my tribe, I found 'em. Whoa, alcoholics anonymous. Maybe chill out on the drinks 'cause I can smell you from like a mile away. This is my baby brother. I took care of him, and now he's taking care of me. - I love you. - I love you, too. Oh, guys, something pretty awesome happened. We are now members, boom, of the ftg. What's, what's the food truck guild? Uh, the greatest thing in the world if you drive a food truck, yeah. Luca hooked it up, we're basically familia now. We're in. Y... you paid money for this? Uh, yeah, you bet I did. It's gonna pay off in spades. We're celebrating. It's a celebration. Celebration! - Hey. - Hey! I'm Donnie. I'm screwed. Hey, Zoey, uh... Zoey, you made it! Oh my god, hey! Liz, how are you? I'm with hunter and Nick, say hi! Uh, hold on, I'll be back. Hey, hey. She's not here with them, she's here with you. And I have some inside information for you. She's ignoring Kale's calls. - Really? - Uh-huh. You're in the game, buddy. You're in the game. Yes, okay. I just gotta get her attention somehow. You girls down, huh? You wanna? No. Have a good night. All right, yep, you too. Read the room, man. Not everyone is as passionate about food trucks as you are. Are you not passionate about the food truck? Is that what you're saying? No, no, that's not what I'm saying. It sounded like that's what you're saying. Do you hear yourself when you talk? "Hey, let me show you my truck out in the parking lot." That sounds like you might abduct them. Yeah, no, I see that. The night's still young, there's plenty of girls. Uh, no more food trucks. No more food trucks, perfect. No more food trucks, no more food trucks. Just talk to them about, uh, science and culture... I'll just go over there and ask her to dance. People still like to dance, right? People love that stuff. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. Dj soap suds for life! Why didn't you catch him? Oh man, party's over. Molls, you like my mixes, right? What is wrong with you? Somebody just f... Ohh! Yeah, that's a good I... He's walking. It's fine, let's go. I have a dj! - This is a bad idea. - No, no, no, - you can figure it out. - He said it's pre-recorded, these are all just backtracks. - I do not know what that means. - These are just fragments pre-recorded to play while he runs his set. Look, that's even better. No, no, the opposite of better, no bueno. Look, this is gonna take me forever to mute or sync. I can't do this. Hey, okay, you remember that cruel ghost of what-if? Now is your chance. Esteemed guests of the motel mermaid... It is my honor to introduce to you, fresh off of his European tour, straight out of Berlin, the man, the legend, dj... Obie d-2.

Yeah, sure, come on. - You okay? - I'm fine. - Another one? - Yep. Sorry. It was this 100-piece art set. It was like, a pretty souped up gift for ten-year-old me. You know the ones that fold open like suitcases? Art was never really my thing. My drawings tended to look like rorschach tests. What's a rorschach test? You know, like, the ink blot thing. Like in the interrogation scene of "teen genius." Not an '80s movie fan? No, I mean, I kind of am, yeah... - Favorite pjm movie? - Who? Patrick j. Michaels? - No? No? - No... - It's okay, he's not important. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Dj obie-d2 is life! Dude! Dj obie-d2? What is that? Where did that come from? You know how you don't like to show anyone your art? Well, I'm must say, I'm very glad that you finally shared it. You were great. Like professional level amazing. Think I got a shot in L.A.? Yes, totally. Now go take my place with Kale. Hey, can I play you something? Something special? It's a dj obie-d2 original. Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. You're a good dancer. Sorry, I didn't mean to like, scare you or anything, I just saw you out on the dance floor and I wanted to, like, come over and say hi. I'm Sebastian. Uh... I'm... i'm, I'm Molly. Mol... Molly Jenkins. And don't you forget it. It would be hard to. Where you from, Molly Jenkins? Oh, well, I mean, I could tell you, but like, do you honestly care? You have a funny way of flirting, Molly Jenkins. What? Do I? Flir... flirt? I... no, no, I... I do not flirt, sir. I, um, I... whew! It is... It is warm out here. Almost... hot... hot, not like hot, like like "hot." Like, just... i'm sorry. It's like, above the preferred body temperature in this place. I tell you what, why don't, um, I don't know, we go hang out with some of my friends? They're just like hanging out, listening to music, and, uh, there's air conditioning. Uh... Yeah. Yeah, sure, why not? - Let's go. - Okay, cool. - What are you doing? - You broke my heart. You betrayed me, Fredo! Okay, we've reached the "acting out scenes from the movies" drunk. He said his name was Mikey. Wait... Okay, is it your goal for the night to scare every single girl away? We dreamt the food truck. That was our dream, Mikey! - What are you talking about? - You! You! You're thinking you're so smart all the time and you're not. You know what you are? - What? - Stupid. Oh, I'm stupid? Oh, sick burn. You know what's stupid? The milleni-yum falcon. That's a stupid name. ♪ But I don't wanna say good night ♪ That was beautiful. You made that for me? When? I've been working on it for a few, uh... Weeks? Since I first met you.

Sorry it's taken me so long to play this for you. No, I mean, it probably explains why we've never hooked up. There's actually been something I've been meaning to tell you. Dude, let go of me! Really? Really, guys? Donnie! Donnie! When I grow up, I'm gonna be, - I'm gonna be like Luca. - Yup! I... I don't know what they're doing. Um... So, uh, about earlier... Josh!

Oh, no, no, no, it's not that at all. I mean, it's very, very melodic in there. It's just I really have to meet someone... You have to meet someone at midnight? Yep. Then I'll tell you what, I'll go with you. For your safety, definitely not 'cause I'm worried I'm not gonna see you again. "Now, that was an experience worth the wait." "Just like in the movies." "It's happening." "Just call me Josh, or j. Michaels from now on." Who are we looking for again? Uh, his name is Dr. Spacecakes. Oh... That's our guy. Hey, I got your stuff, you got the money? You mean the wristbands? How old are you? Here you are, sir. - Hands where I can see 'em! - They're offering me drugs! All right, you two just stay right there... Should we... run? That's a bad idea. Okay, relax, Josh, I'm coming. Hello, babe. I've called you nonstop. Did, uh, did your phone break? I, um... No, uh, yeah, the service is like super shoddy here. Well, what are you doing here? Well, I saw you on Liz's snap, so I dialed her up, grabbed the first puddle jumper I could find, and wham, voilà, here I am. Here you are. Look, I'm sorry about the other day. I... I let my chakras red line. Please, forgive me. Come on. Namaste. And we're back. You know you're the paint to my brush. Okay, you just gotta stop saying things like that. No, I'm sorry, I'm an artist. I just think in pictures, all right? I'm like a turtle in a race car. Never mind, I come bearing gifts of great news. Got a little hook up from my compadre. - Hey. - Vip wristbands - to front and center. - Look at that. And that's not even the best part. Right now, all your earthly possessions are boxed up on a little freight train to Los Angeles. I'm sorry, my possessions are on a train to where? Home, babe. They're on their way home to the city of angels. Hey, have you seen... Kale? Um... W... when did you get here? Uh, just now, joshypoo, and yes, delighted to see you, as well. - Um, where's Molly? - I don't know, she's probably still with that guy from last night. - What? - Oh, it's okay. Calm down, I... i'm sure she'll be back soon. Why didn't you tell me she didn't come back? We need to find her. Okay. Intense little bloke, no? Whoa, Kale. - Was not expecting that. - Why is everybody so surprised to see me? You do realize that Zoey is my girlfriend, right? That would imply that we hang out a lot. Just didn't know that you were coming here, that's all. Yeah, well, maybe if you'd answer my calls. - Okay. - Molly's missing. Missing what? She didn't get to her room last night. Okay, we need to split up and start knocking on doors. Yeah, you, uh, you wanna check the parking lot and I'll check the... Great, we're still in the silent treatment, good. I forgot we were eight. Do we make a better couple than you? Why is everyone so intense here? I know my rights, sir, okay? And I took ap law. I have watched a lot of lawyer shows, and I get a phone call. You're something, Molly Jenkins. Wow, you really love using my full name, don't you? Well, I mean, it's a... It's a beautiful name. - Really? - Don't sue me for it, though, 'cause I think you'd win. Th... that was funny, um... Ugh, has anyone ever told you that - you look exactly like... - Patrick j. Michaels? - Yes! - Yeah, get it all the time. I don't see the resemblance, though. Really? Like... like really? - No. - I mean, you look - exactly like him. - Nope, don't see it at all. My mom was like a huge fan of his, though. Was an extra in like, all of his movies. All right, you two, I got some news for you. We got a call from one of our other stations. They arrested an Addison Preston Roberts, aka Dr. Spacecakes. You're gonna be good to go here soon. Told you he was real. Well, what do you know? Even cops can be wrong sometimes. Would you relax? Zoey's right. Molly probably just hooked up with that dude. Oh, speaking of, you and Zoey were pretty close last night. Like, so close, she should have pepper sprayed you. What did you do? What did you... did you... Okay, the fact that I'm having to pry you for information right now is freaking me out. Did you guys hook up or not? I mean, we didn't... We didn't "hook up" hook up. We had an emotional hookup. I mean, I... I played her my mix and... You finally played her that thing and she was into it? Yeah, dude, she... She loved it. Wow. Molly? Molly? Hey, are you okay? Where are you? Where? Yes, we're coming right now. All right. Just a misunderstanding. Okay, we gotta get her. Okay, so we have to go get our friend from jail. Wow, you guys must've had a wild night. Are you coming or not? You okay? Oh, I... I'm fine. - Yeah? - Yeah. No teardrop tattoos, that's a good sign. Yeah, no, it's all good. I was imprisoned for another man's crime. I'll give you the cliffnotes version. I was meeting a friend who happened to have narcotics on him, and I basically unwittingly ended up stepping in on a sting operation and the perp got away, so they arrested us. Us? Thank you, officer. I appreciate it. We are all set, completely good to go. Ooh! Hi, nice to meet you guys. I've heard a lot about you. Thank you, by the way, for the ride to front and center, I don't know what I would've done. Appreciate it, thanks. This is my Sebastian. Sorry, sorry! My friend who's named Sebastian, you're not mine... You would think after 12 hours straight together she'd be a little less tongue tied around me. I am not tongue tied, I just, I just talk a lot. I think it's cute. I think it's completely adorable. I mean, hey, who knew jail could be like, fun? Hmm? Is that Kale? Yes, it is Kale, again! Zoey, we can we please go? It's already half past the hour. Actually, he's right, we should probably go to front and center 'cause that's what we traveled all the way for. I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna go. "Half past the hour." What are you like 50? - We have a little bit of an issue. - Yeah, I'll say. Don't worry, I'll get rid of him. What? No, no, no. I didn't get the wristbands. The scalper took all of your money. - Are you kidding me? - It's gonna be fine, okay? Because Sebastian actually knows people that work at the festival, so we should be good. Great, great, our only chance is a convicted felon, lovely. Okay, I mean, we're not technically convicted, so like, let's not make this worse than what it was.

If he can't get us there, let's just Chuck him out. Chuck him out? What is wrong? Just chill, all right? Focus on you-know-who. - Don't you... - Don't you do it! Don't do it! Mikey, Donnie, stop it. Yeah, guys, come on, stop. You're always agreeing with my girl, huh? What is that supposed to mean? - It means tha... - It means we should all do a sing-a-long. Am I right? Not you, Sebastian. - Poor guy. - Oh, is that a beak? Yeah, I think that's a huge ass bird. You happy? You killed big bird. - Nope, it's your fault. - I've had enough. I'm calling a lyft. Zoey, pack up your things. Oh, are you sure you don't wanna pack them up for me? - 'Cause you're so good at it. - Adorable. - Do you have your wristband? - No, Josh has them. Well, come on, chop-chop, little man, wristband. - The engine's screwed. - I can fix it, like I always do. - Don't touch my truck. - What is your deal, man? I can explain, Donnie. No, no, I know, I know, 'cause you explain everything. How about this, can you explain what it's like to be a kid one day and then suddenly you wake up and you're a parent? Good luck fixing the truck. I spent all our money on the ftg because I thought this was our dream. Look, I... I could sell my wristband to pay for the damages. Donnie! Josh, I'm gonna need my wristband. Yeah... Where are the wristbands? I... I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? - They're at will call. - Well... But there's no will call at front and center. Hold on, I thought you said you picked them up from like, a Dr. Spacecakes? - Wait, didn't your boss give them to you? - Yeah. Josh? Look, I can explain. I lied, I never had any wristbands, guys. - Wait, what? - I knew it! Wow, that took a turn. - Screw us, right? - Mikey, Mikey... - Look, it was my fault... - No, it's not your fault. I was supposed to buy the wristbands last night... Yeah, no, of course it's not her fault. It's yours. Why would you lie? Because, darling, this was all a plan to hook up with you. - What? - Which seems like - it almost worked. - What? No. No, nothing happened between us. Then why did I hear Josh bragging this morning about your special night? Look, Zoey, I can explain... Look, baby, baby, baby. Whatever happened, happened, all right? I don't own you. You're free to hook up with whoever you want. It's just a little bit of a blow to the ego that it was with that pillock over there. Okay, okay, nobody hooked up with anybody. Look, let's just finish this later, all right? We don't even need the wristbands, we've got an in with the vips, so let's just go. Zoey... Zoey! Zoey, wait. Zoey, wait... So this was all just like a big plan to get me on your diving board and to play your stupid mix? - I thought we were connecting. - I thought I was speaking to somebody who was being sincere. Even if we had hooked up, like, what did you think was gonna happen? 'Cause I know. Nothing. I would have woken up the next day and I would have still gone to L.A. Grow up, dude. You don't know me. You don't even know yourself. I think maybe we should just get in the lyft and go. I mean, we're here. You're going too? You know what? Fine, go. Go have fun at the festival. Can you just hold on a second? Josh! Go have fun with your new friend. Are you serious right now? Fun? Dude, I came here to help you. I was just released from jail. Your cellmate, he's waiting. No. No, you don't get to do this, Josh. You don't get to dump your emotions out on me and then act like it's my fault. I am your wingwoman. I am your best friend. I... I've been here. Let's go. Where's my essay? I was, uh... I don't have it. I didn't do it. So, you know what, just fail me 'cause I don't care about the essay anymore. That's not what I was expecting to hear you say, Mr. Torres. You told me you'd get me the essay today. I don't care about the essay, Mr. Elmer. I'm stranded in middle of nowhere and my life is a mess. Of course your life's a mess, you're a teenager. Yeah, but everything was finally going the way I wanted. You know, like in the movies. The movies? Hey, do me a favor. Just calm down, okay? - Are you calm? - Yeah. Hey, I'm not your therapist, okay? But... You're a nice kid. I actually dislike you less than the others. They annoy me like crazy. So let me give you a piece of advice. Don't place your happiness into something that's not real, but in something that is. I read that once in a fortune cookie. Tsui hangs, best Chinese in town. It's too late, Mr. Elmer. It's over. High school's over, you were right. The weekend isn't over. Get that essay to me. I'm gonna fix it, I promise. Uh-huh. I didn't... I didn't handle the situation ideally. You lied to me. I'm sorry. I'm not gonna go, Donnie. I made a commitment to you... Stop! Would you just stop? Stop? Stop being honest with you? Stop telling... Are you trying to piss me off? I can't win with you. Everything I say pisses you off. I'm not upset that you applied to college, Mikey. I'm upset that you kept it from me. How... How could you think that I wouldn't support you? This is your dream, this, this... This is everything to you. No, man, you are. I'm not... I'm not perfect, you know? But I'm gonna keep doing what's best for you. You want to go to school, so we'll use my savings and we get you there. You're going. Oh my god. I'm sorry I tried to murder you in a motel swimming pool. All right, that should do it. Come on, now, here we go. Yes!
