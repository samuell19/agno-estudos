Say goodbye to your brother Keep it together [Praying in Latin] Go see me in Santo Domingo when you can Yes I'll say Mass in honor of our father [Praying in Hebrew] Free me from my enemies, dear Lord Save me from those who rise against me Protect me from those who commit injustices And keep me from the bloodthirsty They're after my life The powerful have joined forces against me Through no fault or crime of my own With no crime of mine, they get ready to fight me Know that our holy Christian faith... ...needs the practice of the Holy Inquisition You must come forward and tell us... ...if you know of people who observe Saturdays... ...honoring Moses' dead laws If they don't light fire starting Friday evening... If they slit the throats of the animals they eat and spread blood on the walls If they're still waiting for the Messiah to rescue... ...them from their so-called captivity If they practice circumcision, wash their dead Or follow any practises foreign to us If you've ever heard them say that Moses' law is the true law Over our Lord's Jesus Christ We demand you come forward or face excommunication So truth can prevail and the evil may be punished And our holy Catholic faith may blossom Praise Jehovah, for he is good - For his mercy is eternal - What is that? A book of psalms I borrowed from Rabbi Morales Put it away, how dare you, we're on the main road [Monks chanting] Hail Mary, full of grace Blessed is the fruit of your womb Could you spare some water? - Here Father - Where are you heading? To the mines at Taxco, to sell - Are you creoles? - From the Peninsula Thank you, God bless you Be careful - Why? - There's an outbreak They say Jews are poisoning the wells [Monks chanting] What is it Gaspar? I have lots of doubts, Father Lorenzo - About your faith? - No It's about my mother and my siblings I think they're living in sin Explain yourself I fear they practise Moses' dead laws What are you saying? I noticed strange rites at my father's funeral Consider the gravity of your suspicions Are you sure? No Father Lorenzo, I really wish I wasn't That's why I commited a sin by not coming forward sooner And are you, or have you ever been, a Jew? No, never You know me, you know I barely see my family... ...since I joined the convent at age 10 They never told me anything that went against the faith I seldom see them since, they practically don't visit I only went because it was my father's funeral I can't absolve you, to save your soul... ...you must tell the holy Inquisition about your suspicions But I don't know for sure, it's my family You must do it Yes Father Lorenzo Father Lorenzo We're here to request an audience with Inquisidor Peralta Wait here, I'll see if he's available It's okay, you may come in Father Alonso, Fray Gaspar de Carbajal must speak with you Please In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit I'm here voluntarily and I swear to say the truth - Name? - Fray Gaspar de Carbajal From the preachers' order Speaker at the convent in Mexico City Age? 30 years old - Originally from? - Benavente in Castille Speak Following my Christian duty and my conscience I accuse Francisca, my mother, Luis, Balthazar and Mariana, my siblings Of being Jews and practicing rites contrary to our Catholic faith How long since they live by Moses' dead laws? - I don't know - How can you not know? He's telling the truth, I know him, he's been in the convent since childhood Do they observe Saturdays? Do they abstain from lighting things since Friday evening? I wouldn't know Do they practise any of the fasting rituals? Do they sacrifice lamb and spread blood across the walls? Do they slit the throats of the animals they eat? I don't know. I was handed over to the Church as a child So there would be a religious man in the family I suppose they were covering their tracks So you have no basis for this accusation I have them In my father's funeral, they washed the body They buried him without a coffin And prayed in Hebrew That's enough Don't talk to anyone or leave the convent Stay in absolute lock down until the holy Inquisition tells you otherwise Yes Father He's your responsibility, Father Lorenzo I understand Read Mexico City, Friday, May 12, 1593 Being in the morning session, the present Inquisidors... ...received the Dominican friars Lorenzo de Alborns and Gaspar de Carbajal Enlighten me, merciful God Witnesses. Domestic witnesses such as wives and children... ...are admitted to testify against, but never in favor Such testimonies hold a lot of power Given that the crime of heresy is committed in the heart of the home Brother may testify against brother, and son against father We must first obey God, before one's family The nature of the crime and identity... ...of the accuser will be witheld from the accused Order their detention Get the door - I'm scared - Why? No one but the Inquisition knocks this late - Arrest her - No, no, no! Let me go! No, no! Let me go! No! Let me go, no!

My name is Luis de Carbajal Why are you in here? I don't know, you? I suspect my vicar turned me in. I hear voices And I see things - I was a priest in Santa Fe - Santa Fe? - Do you know Gregorio Lpez? - No Who's that? A wise man, he lives a hermit's life I can't remember him - There are no hermits in Santa Fe - Oh I'm cold Cover up, I'll sleep on the floor It's very muddy, I don't want to put you out - Have you had a hearing? - No - Has anybody come to get you? - No, no one, never One night the sherifs came into our house and brought us before the Inquisition My mother and sister must be in another cell Oh, I don't know Do they feed us? Yeah, they bring the food at noon You won't believe me, but I'm eating better than ever - What will become of us? - I don't know Who knows when we're at the Inquisition But have faith, our Lord will help us Hail Mary, full of grace [...] [Luis joins in prayer] They're running away from the outbreak But it'll catch up with them No one will be spared What about us? Will we die too? Not you Your boat will leave from Veracruz soon I owe you my life Master Gregorio Lpez Let me know when you get to Thessaloniki I'll let your family know What will happen to them? Let's eat, go kill a hen Yes Master I know why you're here You write Jewish things The only ones here are those the Inquisition... ...wants to take something from Liar! The Inquisition isn't after riches It just wants to uphold faith and good morals Faith? Morals? By burning, tormenting, imprisoning? Doesn't matter. Anything it takes The life of the flesh is not important What we must save is your soul No one can save us through terror, Friar True religion seeks justice A religion's truth depends on the God it worships Ours is a God of love, yours of wrath, vengeance You're blind, that's blasphemy There is only one God, yours and mine Mine? The only one, there are no others The God of Israel is also your God, Friar I hadn't thought of it that way But it's not true! If your God is almighty, why does he let you rot in here? Because the just must suffer in unjust lands I don't understand you, Luis You're a nobody, Friar Hernando Deep down you don't believe in anything You have no faith Thank you God help you, Father Your food was touched by a dog The outbreak is their fault Aren't you eating? - I can't - Why? God gave Moses the law written in the holy Bible There are filthy animals that shouldn't be eaten This plate is crawling with impurities That's the old law There's only one law Only one word, that which God revealed to Moses Everything else is empty Those who don't follow it are condemned Forever in the eternal fire... God is unique Your prophet wasn't God He was as mortal as you and me That's blasphemy It's not against Him, it's against them The Inquisition is the home of pestilence and abominations Jesus died to save us He died as a man He's not the Messiah The Messiah will be here soon - I know it - Christ isn't God? God is but one, and he's immortal, like his Law And the Messiah? He'll come, and I'll be here to see him No, you won't, they'll burn you Don't you realize where you are, Carbajal? I know my saviour lives and will rise from the dust Keep your voice down, they can hear us Let's get rid of this filth Tomorrow we'll get chicked and vegetables Friar Gaspar? Friar Gaspar? He won't answer, he's gone mute since his family was imprisoned He won't open the door either, do you think he's in? Of course he's in, let's go inside - The outbreak! - How did he get it? - He never left his room - Let's go tell someone, hurry! Friar Hernando Ruiz is called to a hearing Tell us what Carbajal has said and done against our holy Catholic faith I swear to God that I haven't seen or heard him... ...say anything against our holy Catholic faith - Okay, watch every detail - I swear What did they do to you? Do you know why I went there? No They summoned me to turn on you So I could tell them everything we've discussed for the past few days - Did you tell them? - They put me in here to spy on you So what did you do? Nothing - Nothing? - Nothing at all Why? Because I wish my faith was as strong as yours My faith? Did I convince you of the strength of my faith? I don't believe you, Friar Hernando [Playing a board game] - Open the door - Yes, Father Doa Francisca de Carbajal is called to a hearing - No, no! - Come, don't resist - No, no, no! - Let go of her!

No But my daughter Mariana and my son Luis are in jail Are you a baptized and confirmed Christian? Yes, Father Recite the Lord's Prayer Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be thy name [...] Do you know, or can you guess, why you're imprisoned? I don't know, I don't know Must be libel An enemy must want to harm me The holy Inquisition doesn't apprehend anyone... ...without enough information... ...of having said or done anything... ...against our Catholic faith... ...Evangelical law that the holy Roman Church preaches Be it Moses' old law or Muhammad's or Luther's sects Given that you're imprisoned... ...there must be solid information against you We beseech you to tell the truth... ...and free your conscience If you do so, the holy Inquisition will be merciful If you don't, know that justice will be served I understand, but I've done nothing against the Catholic faith And therefore, I can't confess to anything It's libel Someone wants to harm me That's all I can say Okay, bearing the evidence in mind... ...we condemn Francisca de Carbajal to be put in a state of torment She shall remain in such state until she confesses If she should die or become injured during the proceedings... ...the fault lies with her, for refusing to be truthful By God, please don't turn against me For God's sake, tell the truth and spare yourself I've told the truth May God punish he who harms me so I shall endure what He went through on the cross - Let the executioner in - Executioners! Disrobe her Kill me, but don't disrobe me or desecrate me - Tell the truth - I've said everything I know No, no, no, please!

The outbreak's your fault, Jew! Damn Jewish dog! When you see that someone is impatient When you see that all they have are lightnings of zeal Whims of devotion When you see that they serve their own interests Their own satisfaction and glory Don't trust their love for God - Hail Mary - Full of Grace Carbajal At your service, Father I heard you're a caligrapher - I was - Can you remember Latin? Yes Father That's lucky, I need someone who can write and translate Come with me Dog! 17:14 Of the uncircumcised male [Reading inaudibly] Shall be excluded from my people Are you done? Here it is, take a look, Father There's no need - You're kind to me - I'm only fair You deserve it You know better than anyone that the holy Bible shouldn't be read Yes Father Not only is it a sin, but you may worsen your situation Forgive me It's a shame that you disobey me Right when I've allowed for you to sleep at your mother's house You're not humble You don't have Christian meekness - Father - You swore, Carbajal It's my fault, please forgive me Father Oroz May I continue visiting my mother? Yes, Luis Here you go God bless you, son Come in, we were waiting for you [Praying in Hebrew] I saw you dancing, Justa Mendez Dancing? You were dancing with some soldiers You saw me? No, I heard It's not true You go with men Yes I get jealous Why? Nothing's taken from you You're hurting me Do you love me? No - The clean draft, Father - Let me see I have sinned, oh Lord But I won't bid your love and mercy farewell I fear being punished for my sins And I hope your kindness will forgive me I fear being loathed for my ingratitude For my sin comes back enlarged And you're so worthy of being loved What would become of me without you? Who would save me from myself if you weren't there? If your hand didn't give me grace How couldn't I love you, my God? You, who suffers and bears with me? Who would take me if not you, my Lord? Well, it doesn't really rhyme much And what was all that about "me" and "you", for example? It's a bit of a flaw But it could also show audacity on your behalf What matters is your sincere contrition Your Christian feeling... ...is magnificent Thank you Father Oroz Dog wearing a penitence robe God damn heretic, the outbreak is your fault Rabbi, rabbi, you probably have rabies Miserable Jewish scum! What are you doing there? Nothing Why don't you knock? I don't dare Is there anything wrong? No Why are you here? To bring you this I have sinned, oh Lord Why did you write this?

Yes Prison broke you You're terrified of pain You didn't have the strength of your faith And you swore out of fear No Justa Mendez I didn't swear allegiance to any of their gods I just had to get out I discoved in jail that I have the power... ...to drive people to the true religion Shut up Come here I had a vision in my cell I, Jos Lumbroso, needed to be free to sire the Messiah Do it inside me It's okay, it's okay Luis Luis The sacrifice of my circumcision is to cleanse my sins And for your glory, Adonai I can't bear it, I can't bear it I hope the pain subsides I don't want to go back to the Inquisition Hang in there, don't be a coward, Luis I can't, I'm going to die He'll heal, but it was stupid not to ask me to perform it Do you think I can take him home? No, it's best for Rabbi Morales to hide him We're being watched They wouldn't suspect a doctor If they find out about the circumcision... ...we'll go back to the Inquisition And they'll torture us He'll be all right here Tell Father Oroz that he has a fever The outbreak is spreading throughout the New Spain It's the Jews They dismember children during their ceremonies They poison water and their food Their fault indeed Completely their fault For the love of God, that's nonsense They came here searching for the new Jerusalem They want to destroy us and keep the spoils We must exterminate them without mercy The Inquisition persecutes heretics But our Lord wants to see them repent, not dead And the outbreak?

I don't want to say more than I should for fear of torture Carbajal, your process has been overseen by outstanding people They've decided you must be placed in a situation of torment So you tell us the whole truth Whatever I say in that device will be just to get out of it And may God forgive me - Executioner - Executioners!

Just rubble You told them about us, Luis I swore I wouldn't do that and I've kept my word He who told on us will not only cause our death But he also helped them seize our property That's what the Inquisition is really after It's not about saving souls, but seizing goods Nothing leaves the Inquisition alive If they let anyone go, it's because they've broken him What are you saying? You don't believe me? I'm Jewish! And want to die as such And be burned on a Saturday If it's true that Christ is the Messiah That God created him, that he was spawn Then I will go to him However, the Inquisidor dogs will go to Hell Where I shall see them burn in torment Fear has made you mad, Luis "Where I shall see them burn in torment", Carbajal "Fear has made you mad, Luis", I don't know who that was The mad woman can't stay here We must lock her up in San Hiplito [Praying in Latin] Having concluded the proceedings, the Inquisidors find Luis de Carbajal guilty Of the following: changing his given name to Jos de Lumbroso Being Jewish and believing in Moses' law And going back to his faith even after swearing to God We accuse him of waiting for the Messiah Of laughing at Christ's law Of blasphemy Of spreading his heresy He's guilty of all of these crimes He relapsed and shall be excommunicated, as well as delivered to justice He shall be burned alive, thus he will be punished and made an example to others His estate shall be seized and given to Phillip II, King of Spain - What's your name? - Mariana - Mariana de Carbajal - Praise the Lord!
