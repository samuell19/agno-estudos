No. No. Please. What is that? What is that? No, go away! Ooh. Bah humbug! Shoo! Shoo, I say! What's up, guys? My holiday hateriners. It's your girl Scrooge here, back for another Scrooge Tube vent sesh. I have to tell you what just happened to me. There I was, minding my own business when a group of loud carolers completely ruined my vibe. What is it with everyone this time of year, always in a good mood? Kissing under the mistletoe? It's disgusting! I can't stand the holidays. I wish they would just disappear. You know, I-I can't suffer through another cheerful year of endless singing. It's disgusting. Gorgeous decorations? Ew? Children's laughter? No, thanks! Santa, this is going to be the best holiday ever, I just know it. Wait a minute. Something's wrong here. Put in your password. What's my password? Milkandcookie$, one word, the "S" is a dollar sign. Oh, yes. Enough is enough! It's time to end the holidays! I put a curse on it all! Humbug to holidays. Let them be gone. With a wave of my hands, it'll all go wrong. Every element vanishes from this festive season And let it be known that Scrooge is the reason! Oh, Santa, there she goes again with the online rant. But this one's the worst ever. We've got to do something. Oh, Mrs. Claus, we can fix this. Let me put on my thinking cap. On. All right, I know who to ask. We'll go to the most reliable place for information. -What's that? -The internet. Mrs. Claus, I found it, the curse-breaking hack. Come on. Okay. -Follow along with me, okay? -Okay. "If a curse befalls for any reason, here's how to save the holiday season." "A series of challenges must be completed for Scrooge's spell to be wholly depleted." "Get Disney Channel stars to help you along with the zaniest challenges and a few awesome songs." "After each task, the star nominates the next brave contender whose challenge awaits." "There is but one rule for the stars they've selected, before thoust begin, utter..." "Challenge accepted!" "Each mission completed will raise holiday cheer, reversing the curse and saving the year!" -Yes! -There you have it, Mrs. C. Now all we have to do is get our Disney Channel fam, we'll get them all together and we'll get them to do a series of challenges and save the day. -Yes. -And we'll do it in style. -Yes, we will. -All right, give me one of those snowflake handshakes. You know it, Mr. C. Well, this is hilarious. Truly! Santa and Mrs. Claus only have 24 hours to break my curse. Let's see if they can get their Disney Channel fam together in time. My curse versus the stars of Disney Channel, an absolutely epic holiday showdown. Ruth, Raphael, hello! Your eyes aren't deceiving you. It's Santa and Mrs. Claus in the flesh. Mrs. Claus, I can't believe this is real. It's real, and just call me Chris. Okay, Chris. Wow, Santa and I are on a first-name basis. Wow, guys. It's so great to meet you both. You know, I've putting cookies for you guys out every year since I was little. Oh, your gingerbread is bomb, Raphael. Bomb. You remember my cookies? Oh, of course! Santa is a little jolly old elf with a sweet tooth like none other, and he always brings me the leftovers. Now, we are calling because Mr. Claus and I need your help. Ebenezer Scrooge has cursed the holidays. The only way to save them is for you and your Disney Channel friends to perform a series of challenges and raise the holiday spirit. So much is at stake. Can you help? Yes! Great! Your mission will take hard work. My number-one elf needs your help on the assembly line getting holiday goodies ready for the kids. Assembly line? You know what that means, Raphael. Crazy conveyer belt! Exactly! If you can help say those two sweet words I love to hear. Challenge accepted! Oh, great! You will be meeting Santa's elf over here in the workshop and he'll show you what to do. How do we get there? With a little magic! Welcome, children. Are you ready to get to work? Scrooge, what are you doing here? Where's Santa's elf? Well, let's just say he got a little tied up. Now, I will be challenging you to a series of tasks. Your first round is Christmas themed, and you'll be bagging candy canes. Now, listen, they are very fragile, so you must be careful. You know, you break it... ...you buy it. Are you ready to try your hardest to defeat me? - Yeah. - Yeah. Let's see how you do. Start the machine. All right. I see. This is pretty slow, actually. Okay, I think we got this. I'll give you the first two... -Okay. -...I'll start at three, and then we'll just go every other. All right, got it. So we can go as fast as possible. -This is rather easy. -All right. Yeah, not too hard. She made it seem as if it was gonna be the hardest thing we ever did. It's getting a little faster. Oh, you got two coming your way. -That's my bad. -Oh, shoot. You-- oh, you got a lot-- actually a lot coming your way. Raphael, don't-- don't let any drop. We can't let Scrooge see that. Just don't-- don't let them fall on the floor. Okay. I'm putting more than one in a bag. Hmm. You're actually kind of good at this. Next up, round two, which is Hanukkah themed. Now, you'll be bagging toy dreidels, three to a bag. Two white, one blue. Now, this is no piece of Challah. All right, let's speed it up. Start the machine. Okay. All right, you've got two white. -There's an uneven amount. -One blue, is that what it is? You know, I'll take these. Yeah, I think-- okay. All right, let's just. Oh, yeah, this one seems to be-- seems to be coming a lot-- a lot faster. Yeah, this is a lot faster. Um, we gotta do white-- two white and one blue. Oh, no, they're falling. -Oh, gosh, oh, gosh. -She won't notice if it's -two blue, right? -Oh, no, no, no. Okay, I'm gonna do something drastic here. Okay, please-- good job. Bring me some, Raphael. -Okay, got it. -Hurry. Okay, um, if we just kind of push 'em, we can stall them. Oh, no, I hear Scrooge. Oh, that was so hard, wasn't it? Boo-hoo. Maybe we should cancel this challenge just like I canceled the holidays, and we can all go home. No, no, no. We'll try again. Yeah, um, we'll work harder. Oh, you will? Well, you better work faster, too. This is your last round. Now, I'm going to have you decorate Kwanzaa cupcakes, and they better look fabulous. Absolutely fabulous, just like this. And only 50 can go by undecorated or else you lose this challenge. -Well... -We can do it. -We can do it. -Let's see if you can. Make it even faster this time. Start the machine! Raphael, this has to be perfect, so none goes by untouched. Okay, go. Um... -Oh, this is-- yes, okay. -Oh, gosh! Ah, this is hard. You know what? Let me just-- Let me just-- Here, Iâ€™ be just one second. I'll take this side. Oh, oh, oh. Raphael, catch, catch. Oh, yeah. Oh! -I gotta-- I gotta hide this. -Gotta... -Okay. -Hold on, hold on! We gotta switch, switch. Okay, yes. Don't forget the Kwanzaa toppers. -I'm trying. -I see some already. Oh, oh! Oh, my gosh. My shoes are getting so dirty. I think we're doing okay. - Ahem! - Oh, Scrooge! Stop the machine! Well, let's just say that wasn't perfect. But I've got to give it to you. You both worked hard and got through it. So I guess you won this challenge. Yay! Whoo! But I'm not happy about it. Good job! Whoo! I'll take one of those. That's a great idea. That first challenge was everything, Mrs. Claus. I'm fa-la-la-loving it. Oh, okay, Santa. listen, no matter what Ebenezer does to Scrooge things up, I know that we will work even harder and snow her who's boss. You know, this holiday challenge might end up epic after all, with the wrapping and the singing and dancing and dreams coming true. I wonder who's coming next. We'll have to see. So, one challenge down, way more to go to save the holidays and reverse Scrooge's curse. Right, Mrs. Claus? And, ladies, that is how you mix up Mrs. Claus's famous cookie dough. Uh, Mrs. Claus, what are you doing? Wh-- it's my weekly video chat with Kylee, Meg, and Chandler. We do it every Tuesday, Santa. First I've heard of it, but what about the magical challenge? Oh, right, the magical challenge. Hi, Chandler. Hi, Kylee, Meg. I'm sorry to interrupt, but we need your help. You all have a friend, Milo Manheim. -Oh, yeah. -Yeah. Yeah, yeah, right. You know, Milo says that he's un-prankable, so getting him good would really raise holiday spirits like we've never seen before. So you're gonna surprise him and transform his car. That's right. We need you to decorate Milo's car, turning it into my number-one reindeer. You know, the guy with the red nose, Rudolph. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, make it look fly. Like it could fly Santa's sleigh. Yeah, we'll totally do that. Then say the magic words. Challenge accepted. That's Milo's car. He's here. -We got him. -The coast is clear. Let's go. -You got it? -I got it, I can do this. Let's go, let's go. Can you get the mesh ready? Yeah, perfect. Whoo! Oh, yes, this is amazing. Yo, that was amazing. Air high five. Whoo! -All right, what's next? -Decoration. -Do you want to do the smile? -Yes, I do. -Okay, and I have the antlers. -Okay. This looks fun. Ah! Milo's always pranking us. It's payback time. How do I put the smile on? I don't know. Do you know where the nose is? I don't know where the nose is. -Where's the nose? -I don't "nose." -Oh, I found the nose! -Yay! Whoo-hoo! -Okay. -Oh, no. He's gonna freak out. This is amazing. - Do you have some tape? - Here, ready? -Yep. -Catch. Sports! We have to put the finishing touches on. Time for the eyes. -Okay. -Oh, they're so cute. -I got the nose. -Yay! Okay, let's get the tail ready. How much time do we have? He should be coming out any minute. I think he's coming. We should be quick. How does it look? How does it look? -Cute. -It's cute? Yay, we did it! Okay! My car! Surprise! Oh! We really got you. I'm a big prankster, you guys know that. But it kinda feels good to get the prank once in a while. -I like it. -We have to save the holiday. I can't even be mad at you guys. It looks awesome. -Yay. -What's her name? -Penelope? -Penelope! - I love it! - Penelope! - Ooh! This is awesome. This is awesome. - Check the tail. Hey, what? There's a tail? Hey! It's like a unicorn tail. Very clever. Yeah, it's a reindeer unicorn. -We know. -You guys are perfect. Happy holidays. Wow, ladies, you did it. You pranked the unprankable. And, oh, those antlers? Genius? Now, who do you have in mind for our next challenge? It's gotta be Now United. Everybody needs music right now, and if they sing a fun song, we know that'll help us keep the holidays. Oh, yeah, they'll "Jingle Bell Rock" it. - Thank you, ladies. - Thanks, Santa! For this next challenge, we've got the magic of Now United to help us save the holidays. We need you guys to sing your hearts out, bringing the awesomeness of all your voices together. It will help raise the holiday spirit, and we need it now more than ever. Are you all in? What do you guys think? Challenge accepted! Just hear those sleigh bells ring-a-ling Ring, ting-a, ting-a-ling, too Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a ding, dong, ding Come on, it's lovely weather For a sleigh ride together with you Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a ding, dong, ding Outside the snow is falling And friends are calling, "Yoo hoo!"

We need our next challengers. Who's next? Um, let's see. Now United actually just DM'd me and they nominated Ava Kolker, Ramon Reed, and Will Buie. -Oh, those are good choices. -Great. These stars are good, and who knows who they'll nominate next? It could be Ava Kolker with her holiday cheer or Mallory Mahoney with her boundless talent. Oh, that's a lot of names. I don't trust it one bit. What's up, guys? It's your girl Scrooge again. Can you believe these Disney Channel stars? I mean, really. They will stop at nothing to save the holidays. Actually, though, they are kind of good, aren't they? But it's like, why can't they just leave me alone? You know, leave me alone and let me have this one thing, just this one year. But actually we know that nothing is good enough or great enough to stop my curse. Anyway, thanks for all the thumbs down. Haters gonna hate. Ava, Ramon, Will, hello-ho-ho-ho-ho. OMG, Santa, Mrs. Claus? Is that really you? Ramon? Ramon! We can't hear you! Turn your mic on. Sorry! Hi, guys! Oh, man, this is such an honor. Ramon, now we can hear you but we can't see you. Turn on your video. Wow, you all look amazing. Do you have a second? Because we need a little favor. -Wanna help? -Yes! We're asking you to complete an epic wrap battle. And since Mrs. Claus and I are busy in the North Pole, you'll be guided through the challenge the only way to communicate with teens these days, right? - Through text messages. - Yeah. All right, are you up for the challenge? Challenge accepted! Yes! Whoa! Santa hooked it up. Wow. Wow. Hey, I just got a text. Okay, it says, "For the first part of the challenge, you have to wrap an unusually shaped object and make it look good enough to fit under Santa's tree. You'd better get wrapping 'cause you'll only have ten minutes." Ten minutes? Okay, ready? On your marks, get set, go! Oh, wow! Where's the end? - This is wrap-tastic right here. - Exactly. Okay, I got it. Okay! What! -Okay. -Tape! I think I-- that's tape down. Don't worry, guys. We won't let Santa down. We got this, we got this. Yeah. OMG, it's so hard to wrap when you don't have, like, clean, straight edges. Hopefully they won't be able to notice the giant inside out part. You guys, five minutes! Oh, this is actually looking pretty good. Oh, wow. Okay, only two minutes left. Two minutes? Oh, man. - Precision. - Like what I did. Okay, I think that-- I think Scrooge is trying to sabotage us with these unusually shaped objects. - Me, too. - Maybe. Only one minute left. You guys, we better hurry up! - One minute? - Yep! Oh, maybe we should add some sound to this, put some bells on it. Oh, just tape it right there. Ten, nine, eight... Seven, six, five, four, three, two, - one-- - Hands up! We did it, you guys! Air high five! Ramon, yours is so good! Really? I-- I love your snow method. -I think it looks really good. -I know. I think mine -ended up pretty well. -I think I'm sweating. Whoo! Oh, man. I got a text! "You wrapped weird shapes and they turned out a little weird. Now youâ€™ need to step it up. In this challenge, you'll be wrapping a box with a holiday theme. Make it look fantastic, fierce, and festive. Grab your gift boxes, shout out your holiday theme, and get started 'cause you only have ten minutes." Ten minutes? Uh, I celebrate Kwanzaa so I'll take Kwanzaa. I celebrate Hanukkah, so I'll take Hanukkah. I'll take Christmas. All right, let's go a little faster on this one. - Got it. - Let's do it! - Go! - All right. Oh, man, this is so exciting. I know, it's so cool. Blue is like my fave-- wow, this is a lot of wrapping paper. Oh, my goodness. I'm gonna need to scoot some of my stuff over. Remember, Santa said to make them beautiful. I think we can do that. Gotta make sure it's perfect. I'm gonna put some candy on mine so my gift's gonna be sweet. So, Hanukkah is a really, really important and awesome holiday because it is the story of when there were eight nights, but they only had oil for one night to light this candle, and it ended up lasting for eight entire nights, so every night, you get the menorah and you light a different candle for eight nights, and I think it's really cool, and I love how it kinda like stands for something that happened in the past. It makes me feel a lot more connected to, like, my heritage and ancestry. One super cool thing that my family does around Christmastime is we have this special elf. - Ooh, that's smart. - Hey. And every single night, it hides in a new spot, and every morning before school, I'd wake up and I'd try to find it. He always hides in different spots, and we can't touch him. And if we touch him, he tells Santa and we'll get in trouble. We might get coal in our stockings, so we wouldn't want that to happen. I'm gonna be using Kwanza colors on my gift box, red, green, and black. When me and my family celebrate Kwanzaa at home, it's really just a celebration of our culture and also of just life in general. So we just love to sit around, play games, uh, eat together-- that's my favorite part, the food. We only have five minutes left. Five minutes? Okay, we gotta pick up the pace. This fabric's so pretty. It's gonna look so good with the dreidels. - Come on, guys. - Oh, no. This tape is sticking to me. One minute left! One minute left! - Are you serious? - Yes. Okay, I think I'm close. I only have one dreidle to go. Where can I put it? -Ooh, right here. -Just a few more candies left. Thirty seconds, guys, thirty seconds! We need to add more tape. Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot! No! Ten, nine... Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Whoo! We did it! -Oh, my God. -Great job, guys! It's so good! We did it! Guys! Santa's calling! Ho! Ho! Ho! Amazing job, kids! You had a slow start, but you wrapped really beautiful presents that represented all the holidays, and that means so much to us all. Yes, it does! Now, who do you want to continue this journey to Scrooge's inevitable defeat? We think our Raven's homies! Issac Ryan Brown, Navia Robinson, Sky Katz, and Jason Maybaum are the ones! They have mad skills and love the holidays as much as us. That's what I'm talkin' about! Great choices! Thank you, guys, for all your help! Later, Mr. and Mrs. Claus! Is everybody on? Ho! Ho! Ho! It's my friends, Issac, Navia, Sky, and Jason! Thanks for yule-logging on! For your challenge, we need you to bring your spirit of the season to someone who needs it most. Your friend, Anneliese van der Pol. No, no, no, no, no. She's not into carols, all right? She goes to bed early. She's not into "drop-bys." She's a tough nut to crack. Even a nutcracker couldn't do it. Oh, but the holidays are at stake! And we need you! Please! Go to her house and sing your hearts out. She needs to get all the holiday feels when you sing to her. All night long. Come on. Come on. Can you do it? Wait. We get to stay up late? Like, past bedtime? Well... yeah. I mean, I-I guess that is part of the deal. Well, in that case... Challenge accepted! Hey, guys! What you doing here? On the first day of Christmas my true love sent to me A partridge in a pear tree That's great, guys! On the second day of Christmas My true love sent to me two turtle doves And a partridge in a pear tree Great, really great. I've got an early call tomorrow. On the third day of Christmas my true love sent to me Three French hens, two turtle doves And a partridge in a pear tree Thank you. Goodnight! On the fourth day of Christmas my true love-- - Aww, man. - That's a shame. On the fifth day of Christmas What is happening? My true love sent to me five ugly sweaters You don't even know the lyrics? What are you doing here? Four calling birds Three French hens, two turtle doves And a partridge in a pear tree Ugh! Get out of here! Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa la la la la la la la la What the heck the halls? 'Tis the season to be jolly Fa la la la la la la la la We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas And a Happy New Year Good tidings we bring to you and your kin We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year Now bring us some figgy pudding Now bring us some figgy pudding Now bring us some figgy pudding Stop singing!

Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh Hey! -Yeah! -Whoo! I wish that Santa and Mrs. Claus heard that. We "sleighed" it all night long. We did hear. Let me just say, there were good moments. There were a few pitch-y moments. Mm... yeah, but we are so proud. We are so proud you kids were all-through-the-night awesome, but we still need more holiday spirit, so, who's up next? Uh... let's see. I'm thinking Trevor Tordjman? Aww... he's a great dancer! We need some smooth moves like that -to save the holidays. -Whoo. -Bye! -Bye! Hey, Mrs. Claus, hey! Even more's coming their way. The hardest challenges ever. With Trevor's dancing, Mallory and Christian's decked-out trees, and Megan's dream-come-true duet. Who knows what might come next in this Epic Holiday Showdown? Here we are, five challenges down. And this next one's gonna put a little -festive funk in the holidays. -Ooh, I know! I can't wait! Let's get to it! Let's get Trevor here right now. -Okay, ready? -Ready? -Hah! -Oh! Where am I? The North Pole? Awesome! Mr. Santa! -Mrs. Santa! What up! -Hi! Hi! Okay, I know you're both star struck, but no selfies. -Oh. Oh. Okay. -Okay? But for reals, been to long! Man, I haven't seen you since I sat on you lap last year. Yeah, yeah. Let me guess... I'm here because of this curse. Yes, you are. To help break Scrooge's curse, we need you to teach some old-timers how to get down. Oh! I am 1,749 years old! Besides, Santa just doesn't boogie! I don't do this! My idea of "getting down" is going down a chimney! This is crazy! How about if I just... eat some gingerbread cookies and watch you two cut a rug? Now, listen here, Santa. For this challenge to work, I'm gonna need a little bit of boogie, okay? How about if I give you, like, twenty-seven percent boogie? Twenty-seven percent Well, I guess that's better than nothing, right? Okay. All right, guys! We gonna do this thing or what? Challenge accepted! -All right. Are you both ready... -Okay. ...to pick up some skills from yours truly, in the name of saving the holidays? Yes! Here we go. Ready? We're gonna start with a little thing I like to call "The Gingerbread Slide." Let's get it. He's double-fisting gingerbread. All right, Santa, focus! "Gingerbread Slide." I'm with ya. Come on, walk in, Santa. I need you here. Ready? We're gonna lean back, celebrate. -Boom, boom. Big celebration. -Lean it. Celebrate. Then we're gonna slide forward. "Hey!" -Hey! -Show 'em that belly, Santa. -Boom. Yes? -Oh, right there. Then we're gonna swing these hips. One. Two. -Three. Four. -Oh, Santa knows this. Let me see that, Santa. Yeah! Ready? We're gonna lean forward. Boom. Side. Back. We say "nope." Boom, boom. Then we bring in those presents. Bring 'em in, bring 'em in. All the presents. All the presents. We say, "Yes, I got presents!" We say, "That's wassup." All right, we're swinging Santa's Bag. Full of presents. It's heavy. It's heavy. Right? Every year it's heavy. Ready? Swing this thing. Swing it! Then throw it over the shoulder. -Boom! And it's heavy. -Boom! Heavy! -One. Two. Three. Four. -Yeah. Then we're gonna step out. We go right, left. -Back up. Jack it up. Boom. -Jack it up! Transition, wave it in. And bring it back. All right. Now we're ready for the Gingerbread Slide. Y'all ready? Oh, my gosh. I've never been so ready for anything in my life. -Let's go, Trevor! Come on! -All right. Show me that Gingerbread Slide, Mrs. Santa. Ready? We slide to the right. One. Two. -Feel the groove. -I feel it! -And left. Hey, two, three. -Do you feel it, Kris? Four.

We need our ninth. -It's all in the head, right? -Oh! It's the head. Now we're gonna go one, two, three, four. -That's a menorah. Be a Menorah. Stay lit. -I love it. -I love it. -I know we can't go out. Right? Now we're gonna repeat the Gingerbread Slide. To the right, one, two, three, four. Back to the left. Hey, two, three, four. We repeat this, right left, right left. Pull it up. Boom. Hit. We transition it in. And we pose. We're out. Yo, y'all killed it. You looked good. I mean... I wouldn't believe you're 1,700 years old. -Well... -1,749, brah. -Oh, wow. -Santa can speak for himself. -I'm only 1,650. -Yeah, okay. There we go. That makes sense. All right. -We ready for some music? -Yes. Let's hit it! Whoo! Slide it out! Left, side, back! -Say no! Bring it in. -Come on, Santa! -Come on, Santa! -Swing that bag! Whoo! -Let's go! -Come on, come on, come on! Bring it up. Transition. Santa, you gotta slide with me. -Slide with me! Come on! -Hey, hey! -To the left. -Slide with me! Come on! Nay, nay! Hit the Menorah! -Hey! -Hey, I like that move! -To the right. -Slide! Come on, Santa, give me one. -Yeah! All right! -That's what's up! Whoo! Yeah! Wow! You both were amazing! Yeah, I think we all helped. Especially you, Mr. Claus. Thanks. You made that Gingerbread Slide ginger snappy. Ha, ha! I love it! And you tried your best. -That's really what matters. -Yeah. So, Trevor, listen. I know you said "no selfies," but, could we get a photo? Of course, we're close now. -Aww, yes! -Oh, that's great. -Come on, bring it in... Oh! -Okay, okay, now, now... If you could just take pictures, please? Oh, okay, no, totally. No problem. No problem. - All right. Say "egg nog." - Egg nog! Are you getting my angles? Right here? Hold it up. -All right. Let me get in here. -Oh. -Hey! -Happy Holidays! Hey! -Ha, ha! That is great! -Thank you, Trevor! Now our next challenge is pretty important. So we need some peeps, Trevor, who can really handle things. Who are you thinking? How about my buds, Mallory Mahoney and Christian J. Simon? They're perfect for this. For real. They know that holiday hard work. Those are great picks, Trevor. Really amazing picks. Thank you so much for all your help. -Of course. -We will see you very soon. All right. Let me Gingerbread Slide up outta here. Slide! Mallory! Christian! Happy holidays! Wait! Is that Santa and Mrs. Claus? Of course it is! Haven't you seen the news? They've been busy. I've been camping off the grid. What's going on? Oh! So you don't know about the holiday curse thing. How Scrooge took the holidays and Santa and Mrs. Claus are trying to help save them through a series of challenges to raise the holiday spirit. Phew! That was a lot. Wow. That is exactly what's going on. I'm so glad we don't have to explain that again because we've been saying it over and over and over again. -I got you, Mr. and Mrs. C. -Okay, so for your challenge, we need you each to decorate a holiday tree. - Mm-hmm. - Oh! We can totally do that! I'm a pro at stringing lights and Christian is amazing with garland. That's great because each of your trees must include the blingiest lights. The sickest ornaments. And amazing garland and the prettiest tree topper. Yes, plus, something super personal that is so you. Make it magical. Make it beautiful. And make it your own. We got this! Challenge accepted! All right, you better get to it. You need to finish before... -mmm... the sun goes down. -Yep, yep. So that's only ten minutes! So you better hurry and deck your trees ready... set... Decorate! Okay! We only have ten minutes! -Let's go! Uh, garland. -Okay! Okay, I'm gonna start off with this beautiful garland. You guys see this? It's falling, but that's okay. We gotta keep going. I'm from Texas, so I go for the big things first. -You gotta fill this tree-- -Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Family ornament fell. That's okay. I'll leave it right here. All right, I'm gonna pick up this garland. And it's this way. I'm really spinning around right now. Ooh. Okay. All right. How you doing over there, Mallory? Starting with some sparkles now. Okay, you know what? I'm gonna put these right here. I "donut" even know what I'm what I'm doing right now. I see what you did there. I see what you did there. I have these beautiful, like, icicle, white paint brushes-- ornaments that I will be using. Ice cream cones! Mallory, I love art. Look at this paint palette ornament. -Isn't it nice? -That is so cool! I know, right? Okay, so I'm hanging that up right now. I got the yellow. I got the blue. You know what? I'm gonna move the yellow. -We only have two minutes left! Okay! -What? Oh, no! O. M. G. Okay. -This is not enough time! -I know! It's not enough! We got this! We got this! Now I am putting some pictures of me and my new little puppy, Lord Stanley, up. Ah! Lord Stanley. I love that name. 'Cause we can't have Christmas without puppies. Right? I love making my tree personal, Mallory. I got pictures of my family. And I got some art because I love doing art on my off-time. So I'm doing that. Oh, look! We got a little disco ball! Ooh! Hey, I got some of those, too! Oh, really? -Look! Disco party! -Oh! It's a party! Okay. We got 30 seconds left! -We have to get to our toppers! -Oh, wow! Oh, wow! -We gotta get to the toppers. -Uh... -Whoo! -Go, go, go! Go, go! Hey! You know what I just realized? My tree topper matches my outfit. I didn't even notice! Wow! Super nice! Okay! -Okay! -Are you ready? Five, four, three, two, one! Happy holidays! Whoa ho, whoa ho! Those trees are incredible! They're so lit! Mallory and Christian, you did it! Look at those donut and ice cream ornaments. They look delicious. Um, we need that on our tree, Mrs. Claus. There will only be carrot and celery ornaments for you, sir. But I'm carb-loading for the big day! Now, guys, who do you think can handle the next challenge? It will not be easy. Mallory and I want Meg Donnelly to sing a song. -Great idea. Thanks, guys! -Yeah. -Bye, Santa Claus! -Bye, Mrs. Claus! It looks like I'll have to bring out my special sauce, if these Disney Channel kids have any more tricks up their sleeves. And I heard they'll be making duet dreams come true with Meg Donnelly. We can't have that kind of magic in the mix! It's just too strong! What's up, guys? I've got a few more chances to try and win this thing. And my curse is holding strong, but, I might need to add a little more magic to the mix! Hah! That's it! Another layer of my curse to break. I have to say, my curses are some of the best out there. You know, people have been talking about my curses for years. Years! That spell's really taken it out of me. I'm going to have to take an "angry nap." Later hateriners. Now Scrooge's curse is even stronger. It's gonna take something pretty incredible to put a dent in this one. -Meg! -I'm here, you guys! There you are! It is so good to see you! Meg, you were nominated to complete another challenge to save the holidays from Scrooge's evil plan. She just strengthened her curse so we desperately need you. This... is your moment. I can do this, Santa. Here's the thing. A super special Zombies fan sent me a letter saying how much she loves you and your voice. That's so sweet. I-I can't wait to see who it is! All right. You know what? We have something even better in mind. For this challenge, we want you to spread holiday cheer by singing a duet with her. That's amazing! Challenge accepted! Take a look at your amazing duet partner Kia. Hey! I've been singing ever since I was a little girl. Basically, ever since I had my voice, to be honest. Music is so incredibly special because it allows people to really express their feelings through beautiful songs and beautiful words. Music is just incredibly powerful. I really love "Zombies" and all the Disney Channel movies because of all the music and dancing. It's absolutely spectacular. If I had one holiday wish to duet with one Disney star, it would definitely be Meg Donnelly. -Kia, are you ready? -Let's do this. Joy to the world The Lord has come Let earth receive her King Let every heart Prepare Him room And Heaven and nature sing And Heaven and nature sing And Heaven, and Heaven And nature sing Joy to the world The Savior reigns Let men Their songs employ While fields and floods Rocks, hills, and plains Repeat the sounding joy Repeat the sounding joy Repeat the sounding joy Repeat the sounding joy Repeat, repeat The sounding joy Joy to the world Joy to the world Joy to the world Joy to the world Joy to the world and every boy and girl It's time for us to celebrate Do it now don't hesitate Sing it out loud 'cause you should be proud Of the person that you are bright as a shining star That's the difference we can make Make the world a better place Use the joy in your heart and the smile on your face Fill the holidays with love, happiness, and cheer This is Issac wishing you A safe and happy new year what's up He rules the earth With truth and grace And makes the nations prove The glories of His righteousness And wonders of His love And wonders of His love And wonders And wonders of His love And wonders And wonders of His love Joy to the world! We did it! Thank you, Issac! That was so great, ladies. You both sounded awesome. Yeah. All that holiday spirit just warmed my holiday heart. -Thank you. -It felt really good. Let's take a look at how we're doing in taking out Scrooge's curse. Hmm. Scrooge seems to be holding strong with that curse. I'm afraid we're gonna lose the holidays. That can't be right. There has to be a way to push a little harder with one more challenge. Listen, Mrs. Claus and I will figure this out. You've done enough. Thank you so much for your beautiful voices. Meg and Kia, even if we don't get the holidays back, you still made this year so special. Oh, Santa, what are we gonna do? There's only one challenge left, and I can't imagine they can draw up something in time. These holidays are peanut butter and jelly toast. Mrs. Claus, I know we haven't broken Scrooge's curse, but all these challenges, all the hard work, well, this is exactly what the holidays are about. -Coming together for good. -Yeah, you know, you're right. Even if this curse is unbreakable, I am just so proud of everyone. You better believe we will figure out a way to defeat Scrooge. We just need something real unconventional. Something that'll knock her off her toes. Hello? Hello, hello, hello? -Do you hear that? -I think it's coming from your butt. What? No. It's coming from my satchel. Uh, season's greetings. This is Santa. Santa, is that really you? It's me, your best friend Cricket. Wait a second, did you just butt dial me? Of course not! I-- I was calling you. Right, Mrs. Claus? Hello, Cricket. Um, uh, we're trying to break this evil curse and, and, oh, oh-- we need you to do a challenge. Good save. So you two are breaking an evil curse, huh? Well, what's in it for me? Hmm, let's see. Um... we currently have you on the "so so" list. But, if you help us out-- we could move you over to the "nice" list. Cool. What's the challenge, my dudes? Prank call Ebenezer Scrooge and make her say she loves the holidays. Ha! Challenge accepted. This'll be easier than stealing my dad's tractor. Okay, transferring you to Scrooge. Scrooge speaking. -What do you want? -Howdy, Scrooge. May I please speak with, uh, Olive D. Holidays? I'm sorry, Olive who? Olive D. Holidays. Can you say that name back for me? Olive D-- I know what you're trying to do. Nice try, you little imp! Ha! Who is that? Give me that! How dare you call my grandson an imp? Only I get to do that! Well, your mischievous child was trying to trick me into saying I love the hol-- I'm not going to say it! Gramma, we need to make Scrooge say she loves the holidays to break an evil curse. Mm, that sounds weird, but sure. Now you listen here, you devil woman! You're gonna tell my grandson you love the holidays or I'm gonna jam my five pound fruitcake in your craw! No, please! I got it as a gift in 1978! Not the fruitcake! Anything but the fruitcake! It has candied prunes. I love the holidays, okay? Great work, Cricket! Bingo, bango. So does this mean I'm on the "nice" list? Well, Cricket, I mean, you're good, but, um, let's see, um, not so sure about Gramma. Yeah, it checks out. Bye, Cricket. Bye. Remember that Christmas is December 25th! Uh, Cricket, we're well aware of that. Thank you. We just got an important update. -Let's get everyone on a video call. -Okay. Yeah. Hey, everyone, Mrs. Claus and I just received this candygram from our elves here at the North Pole. They've been keeping track of our challenges. They've checked it twice and the verdict is in. -Oh, boy. -Oh! Challenges completed. The holidays are saved! We did it! Scrooge lost the battle. The holidays are yours once again. We did it! We did it! We did it! We did it! No! No! No! Bah hum-- Oh, who am I kidding? I love the holidays! Oh, we know you do, we know you do. Thank you so much to all our Disney Channel friends who helped us. You know, Santa, I said at the start of this this was going to be the best holiday ever, and it is. Mm-hmm. You are right, Mrs. Claus. -Yes, yes, yes. -And to all of you at home, remember this holiday season, the best gift of all is spending time with the people you love most. -Right, Scrooge? -Absolutely. So, before we go, we have one final challenge -for all of you guys at home. -Yes. We want to see you do the Gingerbread Slide that Trevor taught me and Santa, and Scrooge is gonna do it, too. -Yes. -And do us a favor. -Share it with all your friends. -Yes. Happy holidays! Hey!
