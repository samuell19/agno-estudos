If he were here, his corPse wouId've been eaten by crows, dogs and crabs. But...even if his shadow is anywhere around... ...I wouIdn't even Iet the sun set on this viIIage. I'II PersonaIIy go and search every home. You search in this house. Ronnie is the onIy one in the entire viIIage... ...who's the best friend of the Portuguese. You're very Iucky. WouId you Iike beer? Your home is cIose by. Go and inform GoPaI that Montero has come... ...and that he shouId arrange for some drinks. I've understood. Father...Ronnie is searching the entire viIIage. The PoIice is accomPanying him. He's searching for shekhar. - Did you see him? - Nowhere. Even if he had Passed through here, I couId've sensed it in the air. Let's go and visit GoPaI's house too. GoPaI is cIose to me. His daughter, AnjaIi, Iooks after JuIie's home. You mean your home... Every home in this viIIage is my home. And I'II aIways be weIcome at every home. WeIcome, sir. The InsPector susPects that... ...a traitor is hiding in one of the homes in this viIIage. A traitor...in Ronnie's viIIage? In Ronnie's viIIage! If I find him, I wouId gun him down myseIf. You may write in your rePort that he was kiIIed in an encounter. What's inside this room? My daughter is inside the room with her husband. - shaII I wake them uP? - No. It doesn't matter. AnjaIi is Iike a daughter to us. A mother is the most sacred form of a woman. One worshiPs God...because He gives us Iife. shaII I Iook uPon you as a mother or as a Goddess? I'II aIways be obIiged to you for the sacrifice made by you today. Brother! Everything is fine, sir. The frock was very nice... Whom have you come to visit? I've come to meet GoPaI. I've a message for him from Gonda. Can you teII me where he Iives? Yes...go this way, and turn right. You'II find GoPaI's house there. How can it be? I've brought authentic news from the Governer's House. But the carnivaI is in the next month itseIf. Yes. If we eIiminate the PoIice chief on that day... ...we wouId succeed in shaking the Portuguese government. We'II sureIy go ahead with it. You may gather your men. The men can be arranged. But we'II need buIIets and revoIvers. Why does one need revoIvers? We can fight without buIIets or revoIvers. But we cannot win it. We aII desire your victory. TeII me what I can do for you? No. As it is, you've done a Iot for me. We're hiding in Ronnie's viIIage because of you. Are you doing aII this for your own sake? If you're PIaying with your Iives, it's our duty to do whatever we can. I'II arrange for whatever revoIvers you need. - Be carefuI. - KeeP it there. Why there? Let it be here. OPen it. UnIoad the goods first. These three boxes shouId be sent uPstairs. - You didn't oPen it? - No... I thought it wouId be a good idea to unIoad the goods first. Goods can be Ioaded Iater. I want to check its contents. What's this? Books? How did these medicaI books arrive here? They're heavy! send these books to the charitabIe hosPitaI. They seem to have Ianded here by mistake. Where are these ParceIs to be sent? so...you know? Yes, I know. And I aIso know that shekhar is in GoPaI's home. And that these goods have arrived for him. - But earIier you never... - Like others, I too am quiet. And we'II remain siIent tiII shekhar desires it. What're you Iooking for, sir? I'd ordered a watch for the PoIice chief's daughter. Today is her birthday. Where is PabIo? He's aIready Ieft. Find him, wherever he is. He knows where it is kePt. Did you want something from the stores? Now that you've come, I've got everything. I've reaIized today that I'm nothing without you. You're the onIy one whom I fuIIy trust. Why not, sir? I can do anything for you. I know... You're the one who can handIe my work after me... -...and who can rePIace me. - No, sir. Both of us are PoIes aPart. You must've deIivered the books at the hosPitaI. I did deIiver them. The doctor has conveyed his thanks to you. But I forgot to teII you. You...forgot...a Iot eIse too. You forgot to oPen the book. You forgot to show me this revoIver too. Who has ordered them? What for? To use them against me? Who're your associates? Nobody. - Who're your associates? - No one. - Who're your associates? - Nobody. - TeII me... - There's none. - You thankIess creature! I wiII... - KiII me, if you Iike. - But I won't oPen my mouth. - I'II choP off your tongue and... No! I'II not choP off your tongue. If your tongue is cut off... ...how'II your consPiracy be known? Come on... What're your security arrangements? There'II be three guards on the gaIIery.... ...and one guard each at the doors. There wiII be two guards at the main door. The PoIice commissioner wiII be over there... ...so that our men are cIose to him for his Protection. Ever since the revoIution has gained momentum in this country... ...there's no charm Ieft for the PoIicemen at the Parties. You've got to be aIert aII the whiIe. The PoIice commissioner too had refused to attend this Party. - Why? - Because of shekhar. Yes. since he's on the run, there's aIways a danger. Now that he's a criminaI in the eyes of the government... ''Watch out, my friend... they're Iooking out for you'' ''I come here, for I'm crazy about you'' ''to sing and dance and make merry'' ''How'd you know what gifts I've got for you'' ''Watch your steP, my friend... they're Iooking out for you'' ''I come for you, I'm crazy about you'' ''to sing and dance and make merry'' ''How'd you know what gift I've brought'' ''Watch your steP... they're Iooking out for you'' ''PeoPIe here think you're a haPPy-go-Iucky young man'' ''They might be mistaken... but I know who you are'' ''PeoPIe here think you're a haPPy-go-Iucky man'' ''They might be mistaken... but I know who you are'' ''so take my hand... we have one goaI'' ''I know what you feeI...''

""Watch your step... they"re Iooking out for you"" Traitor! Enemy of the country! What do you peopIe think of yourseIf? You kiII your own men and caII yourseIf patriots? I"II wipe out the very existence of your party. - Stop it, Ronnie. - I won"t spare any of you. I"II kiII aII of you. Try to understand! Come on... Break their Iimbs and throw them into the sea. AIong with these scoundreIs, their revoIution too wiII sink in it. Mr. Ronnie... His ExceIIency wants to speak to you. Today, I"ve made possibIe something which the Goa poIice couIdn"t. You know how happy the Portuguese government is with me? His ExceIIency congratuIated me... ...and he personaIIy invited me over for tea! Tomorrow, your Ronnie wiII sit next to the ExceIIency... ...and drink tea. Just Iook how powerfuI I wiII become! The entire Goa poIice wiII be under my controI... ...and I"II eIiminate the revoIutionaries... ...and wipe out the existence of their Azad Party. - Father... - May you Iive Iong. - Mother! - My son... Sign this power of attorney. You"ve to just appear before the judge and say that... ...you"re innocent, and that you haven"t committed the murder. - But it"s a Iie. - The poIice records state that... ...the poIice didn"t find the pistoI from which the buIIet was fired. SecondIy, you weren"t arrested at the pIace of the crime. It"II be difficuIt for the poIice to prove that you committed the murder. - This is onIy to fight my case. - What exactIy do you want? No... don"t separate me from my coIIeagues. - What do you mean? - If it must happen... ...the Iawyer wiII fight for aII revoIutionaries, not me aIone. I cannot betray my coIIeagues. PIease make him see reason. I spent a Iot of money and caIIed over a Iawyer from Bombay... ...and he"s refusing to sign the power of attorney. I can manage to free him, but he... Don"t worry about my freedom. If you"re so concerned, heIp free my country. The whoIe of Goa wiII be gratefuI to you. Did you hear? PIease expIain to him. It"s a matter of his Iife and death. We cannot change Shekhar"s decision. You"re saying this? Your onIy son is going to be hanged to death and you...? Not everybody is destined for such deaths. We regret that we have onIy one son. If we had thousands of sons... ...every martyr wouId"ve been the son of Dayanand and Saraswati. Mother... May you Iive Iong. - Are you going somewhere? - No. May you Iive Iong. I"ve come to stay here with you. With us? Why? Is this not my home? I was to have come to Iive here forever. You"re right. Circumstances have changed now. But I haven"t changed. I"m stiII the same Usha, whom you"d accepted as your daughter-in-Iaw. WouIdn"t you give me the right to serve you? WouIdn"t you Iet your daughter-in-Iaw into the home? My dear daughter-in-Iaw! For us, you"re our son as weII as our daughter-in-Iaw. Come inside. What a caIamity it is! Be patient...be patient. It Iooks as if some angeI has appeared on the soiI of Goa. ReaIIy...Shekhar"s parents are no Iess than a God and Goddess... ...to have given birth to a son Iike Shekhar. It"s our Iuck that we provided sheIter to Shekhar in our viIIage. Whenever the history of Goa"s freedom wiII be written... ...aIong with Shekhar"s name, this viIIage too wiII be mentioned. I"II eIiminate the existence of this viIIage. You"d hidden my enemy in my own viIIage? Where have you hidden him? TeII me... In whose house did you keep him? Where did you give him sheIter? Who eIse in this viIIage agrees with you? - You agree with him? - No. - Where did you hide him? - I don"t know. - TeII me... - He was in our home. In your house? No. He was in my house. - He was in my house! - He was in my house! Shut up! Do you know who I am? My name is Ronnie. I"m the one who has fed you. The food in your stomach has been provided by Ronnie. The dress on your body beIongs to Ronnie. You"re aIive because of Ronnie. And today aII of you are raising your voice against me? Get out of here...get out! We considered you our Godfather. But you"re no Ionger our Godfather. You had given me these ears. But I aIways heard the voice of Shekhar with these ears. I"m deaf. Even if I turn bIind, I"II stiII foIIow his voice. You"re not one of us anymore. He beIongs to us. Here...take your ears. Who taught you these things? Whose backing is that that has given you so much of courage? Who is the person who has Ient his voice to you? TeII me...who is it? Sir...your near and dear ones too are with us. My near and dear ones? If you don"t beIieve it, go to the stores and see it for yourseIf. How many peopIe wiII you shoot? Not just me, not just this viIIage... ...but the whoIe of Goa is on Shekhar"s side. The entire country is gIorifying Shekhar. And your name... Yes...my name..what do they say about my name? They say that you"ve betrayed the nation by having Shekhar arrested. And what"re you peopIe doing with me? Is this not betrayaI? Is this not betrayaI? And this...is this not betrayaI? I heIped you so much. And you were misIed by someone into turning against me. Why? Why? Why? What is so speciaI about him that... ...he couId steaI from me my viIIage and my peopIe. What"s so magicaI about him? His patriotism...he"s not a seIfish person Iike you. You do everything for your own seIf. He does it for others. Even if you give anything to the viIIagers... ...it"s onIy for seIf-gIorification, to make them saIute you. And he...the whoIe of Goa saIutes him whoIeheartedIy. If he faces the buIIets, it"s not to fiII up his coffers... - ...but to Iiberate his country. - That scoundreI! A scoundreI! Don"t abuse him. He"s the rising sun on the soiI of Goa. - I spit on such a sun. - Your spit never reaches the sun. It, in fact, sprays your own face with it. That sun is going to set very soon. Within a few days, he wouId be hanged to death Iike a dog. Shekhar has Iived Iike a tiger. And he"II die a tiger"s death. It"s you who has been running after weaIth and power Iike a mad dog... ...and I"II die a dog"s death. Is that what you want to say? There"s stiII time. If you want to repent your deeds... ...go and ask for pardon from Shekhar"s parents. Pardon? Pardon ! A mad dog doesn"t ask for pardon. He just bites. And by tomorrow morning, Shekhar"s parents wiII be eIiminated. TeII me! Where"s the chiId? So you aren"t content as yet! Whom have you come to kiII? - Who is it? - Who has come? Do you know him? He"s the same kiIIer who Shekhar... Yes...I know him quite weII. Many times, even an ordinary person... ...cannot express his true feeIings in pubIic. You"re Ronnie... Perhaps you beIieve that we have hatred for you. No, my son...We"ve no compIaints against you. The path chosen by Shekhar was bound to end in such a way. If it had not been you, somebody eIse wouId"ve had him arrested. You"re not at fauIt. And if you think that you"ve committed a mistake... ...then your feeIing of regret wiII wash away your sins. Yes...you"ve done the right thing on your behaIf. Just one thing...Iooks Iike the feeIing of Iove towards... ...your country is yet to be awakened within your heart. PeopIe say that Ronnie is heartIess and ruthIess. But somewhere in his heart, exists the goodness of a human being. And I"m confident that his goodness wiII awaken his souI some day. Whom was I going to kiII? One who gave me refuge in his home? One who saved me from death? What if they were kiIIed at my hands? JuIie was right... I did everything for my own seIf. And Shekhar is doing it for others. Shekhar"II be hanged tomorrow. And I"II be responsibIe for his death. I"II be responsibIe... Now I can understand why Purandare had shot at father. He was so badIy wounded that he wouId"ve been arrested... ...and the poIice wouId"ve asked him about the hideouts of the patriots. My father was a true patriot. And I...his son...is a traitor. An enemy of my own country! No! No! GIory to Shekhar! Long Iive the revoIution ! Long Iive the revoIution ! Long Iive Shekhar! You"d been to see Shekhar? Yes. Why? You wanted to see Shekhar"s reaction... ...when he wouId"ve hear about his death sentence? You knew that earIier! Aren"t you happy stiII? - I went there to seek happiness. - ReaIIy? Take this... Load your revoIver with buIIets. And eIiminate aII those whom you think to be your enemies. WiII you support me? One revoIver won"t do. The entire Portuguese government is my enemy. - Yes... - You ! Neither do I have the time to make up for my mistake... ...nor do I have a companion. Can I get back my JuIie? Not just JuIie aIone, but the entire viIIage is with you. The whoIe of Goa is on your side. AII of us are prepared to sacrifice our Iives. I"II caII everybody right away. It"s said that a battIe can be won... ...as Iong as there is at Ieast one buIIet Ieft in the revoIver. Long Iive the revoIution ! Long Iive...the revoIution, eh? Long Iive the revoIution !? O citizens of Goa! This mad revoIutionary is being hanged to death in your presence... ...so that you can take a Iesson from his death... ...and so none of you ever dares to repeat such a mistake again. This rebeI, who disturbed the peace of Goa, wiII be kiIIed... ...in a way which wiII become an exampIe for the future generations. His voice has instigated aII of you against the Portuguese government. Today, this voice wiII be choked with the noose and siIenced forever. Friends! This is not a noose. It is a garIand of victory for us revoIutionaries. Don"t scream. Long Iive...! Long Iive... Long Iive the revoIution ! - Long Iive...! - ...revoIution ! - Long Iive the revoIution ! - Long Iive the revoIution ! Stop! HoId on ! No! Not in this manner. You shouIdn"t do it this way. If you kiII him Iike this, there"II be riots here. His death shouId be ceIebrated in so much of grandeur and pomp... ...that it shouId become a spectacIe for the peopIe. I think you"re right.

I"ve aIso wrapped the shroud on my head. The Indian army is crossing the boundary and marching forward. BIow the bridge before they manage to cross over. We"II have to save the bridge. You start the pIane. I"II stop them! Shekhar! Start it! We"ve been informed that the Indian army is marching towards Goa. Before the enemy reaches this bridge, we shouId bIow it away. BIow up this bridge! Welve become free! Youlve scaIed the heights of the skies today! No... Itls this tricoIor which has scaIed the heights. Now I just want to Iive in its shadow.
