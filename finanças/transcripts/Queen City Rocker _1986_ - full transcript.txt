Don't you think we're getting kind of old for the shit, Flak? Old? Is that what you call it? Sounds like a case of small balls to me. POLICE LOUDSPEAKER: Oh, now, break it up. Move along, you fellows. Watch your stick, man. MAN: Dicks. MAN: Stupid sucks. He's crazy, man. Can't trust him. He just wants a fight. WOMAN: They're all kids anyway.

Cops! Freeze! Hold it! All right, come on, out you go. [SIREN] FLAK: Next time, bro. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] Wrapped up in my overcoat. Protection from the cold. Before we unlock the door, whoa. Lechers and [INAUDIBLE] clinging to my coat. Trying to sell their terminal condition. Turn back, grab the line. There's a whole life for living. You gotta go and you gotta go and forget it. [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] A young man tries, he has to fight the cores of tradition. Watch your feet as the crowd fills the [INAUDIBLE]..

No. Well, what do you want to do? You want to go home? Yeah, well where is that? I've got a car. Yeah, but you can't drive. Would you wait here if I got a cab? You mind? No. Do you want a comb? Can't see anything anyway. Well, I'll stop and turn on the light if you like. No, don't bother. Thank you. Aren't you going to tell me what a jerk I was, what an idiot? Why should I? Well, I was. You don't know the half of it. Everybody's a jerk sometime. Turn right here. Hell, I forgot all about this. Why don't you come in for a drink or something. No way. I meant what I said about thank you. You were really something. You were. No, come on. It was nothing. You really believe that. Oh, please, come in. The least I owe you is a drink, right? Thanks. But. What are you going to do then, just ride off into the night like the Lone Ranger? Please. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] Didn't I hear you saying you got class. Did you say that she is a flim flam flirt. Are you saying that some double dealing doll [INAUDIBLE] did you dirt. Well, Bub, welcome, welcome, welcome to the club. Now you know the feeling of-- I've being warned to stay away from you on pain of death. But I always do like to see what my daughter drags home. Woops. Did I say that? Excuse a mother's concern, but she's certainly breaking new ground with you, isn't she? Well, would you like a drink? Or are you just going to stand there looking sullen? Whatever. Wonderful. Stacy's a great one for statements, you know. I should think that's why you're here, wouldn't you? She's rather sparing of details when it comes to her personal life. However, the story goes that you rescued her from some nasty bar brawl downtown. Hello. Where she had no earthly reason to be in the first place, which rather makes you a knight in shining leather, doesn't it? Doesn't it? Well would it be condescending of me to offer you a beer straight off? I'm curious, actually. Beer's fine. Oh, excellent. Now don't be shy you'd like a glass. Then you're happy. Stacy shouldn't be long. She's upstairs changing for second round. Why don't you just circulate, yes? Perhaps you'll make some useful contacts. You must be the boy, the boy Stacy bought here? Exactly. I'm told I owe you something in the line of [INAUDIBLE] thanks. That's OK. No, I expect you don't know our Stacy very well. Let me stress that she's a very, very fine girl. But, she does have a tendency to [INAUDIBLE] for a fete. You understand? [INAUDIBLE]? Fine. Well, I can see we have a mutual understanding, in which case I no longer detain you. I'm certain you'll be wanting to resume your interrupted evening, and no doubt a little extra cash won't go amiss. I don't want any money. Oh, I absolutely insist. We can't send you out empty handed, now can we? You're handling this all wrong, Richard. I'm simply making a just offer a time and effort spent. You're treating the boy like a servant to his face. Kindly allow me to make my own decisions, will you? Richard, you're behaving like an asshole. Monica, go fuck yourself. Oh, bloody marvelous. I'm sorry. I knew something like this would happen the moment I set eyes on you. Come on, will you? You're drunk. Drunk am I? [LAUGHS] I'm drunk, in my own house! He does have eyes, Richard. My old man's a drunk too. But he's on the bones of his ass. Oh, so now I'm like your old man. There's only one difference between him and you, between all of you. Insolent little shit! Don't you touch me! Stacy! [TIRES SCREECH] Think I'm saying there? Well, come on, go. That was great. I've been dreaming about for years. I loved it. You're too much, you know that? I mean, did you see their faces? What's wrong, don't you think it's funny? [TIRES SCREECH] You think I'm some kind of clown? I'm here to make you laugh? No, of course not. Think I like doing shit like that? Don't you? I do. I'll take you back. No. I don't want to go back. You don't think I'm like them, do you? I want to be with you. I like you. Well, would you take me back to town at least to get my car? And would you tell me your name? Both alcoholics, I guess. Drunks, really. I guess you could see that. He's a lawyer and she-- I don't know. I think she was educated to marry someone like him. I wonder a lot what keeps him going, you know? Whether they like it. What do you think? Don't know. Would you believe he wanted me to be a lawyer too but I'm not going to. I'm going to design school. What are you going to design? Beautiful things. You quit school when you were what? 15, 16? Why? Boring. Supposed to be though, isn't it? Prepares you for later life. You're too rich to be bored. That's what you think. Nice car. It's been quite a night. Do you have to go away? [HORN HONKS "DIXIE'] [TIRES SCREECH] MAN: Yee-haw! [DRUNKEN YELLING AND CURSING] Shit! YOUNG MAN: Hey, we been looking for you everywhere, man. YOUNG MAN: Good to see you, mate. Thought the cops got you. No way. What's going on, man? YOUNG MAN: I thought you were gone for sure. YOUNG MAN: Man, where you been? YOUNG MAN: Hey, check out the lady.

Go for cruise in the car? - Come on. We'll have some fun like we used to. Grow up, Andrew. Look, I said I'm busy, OK? I mean it. Just leave me alone. Hey that's really neat. What's Andrew ever done to you? - Nothing. It's just-- It's shit, right? The whole thing's shit. I'm warning you, Matthew. Just tell me one thing, that's all. Tell me you want to be doing this. Don't be so dumb. It's not right. How much you into to these guys for anyway? Since when did you start caring? Give me a chance. I can handle it. Oh, yeah, with your job on a rubbish truck. And how long is that going to last? MAN: Get in the car. All right, I'm coming. Fran. Here we go again. Who's she? His sister. Come on. Fran, I'm not finished yet. What the hell is this? Are you dragging in rough off the street now? Get him out of here. - He's my brother. - Oh, yeah? Family reunion? Who gives a shit. Piss off. I just want to talk to her. You got $100, you can talk to her. You're too young anyhow. Fuck you. Matthew, no. Leave him alone, please. Matthew, just go home, will you? You still working here or what? Fran! She your sister, is she? Well, you don't have to worry about her. She's going to do very well here, yeah, very well. She's got what it takes, see? What an impetuous boy. That's one of the rubbish truck kids, Jack. Is he? Well, you know who I am then. Right, up you too. [CLUCKING] You really should learn to relax. Enjoy yourself more. You know, let it happen. He's very tense. Tell you what. You like music, do you? I mean all this heavy metal stuff? I can't stand it myself. Got them tickets? Now here's a couple of tickets for the rock concert. You take your girlfriend, hey? You have a good time. You relax. Enjoy yourself. No hard feelings. Don't worry, Joe, he's a smart boy. Get him out of here. I'll buy me one of those. - Stinking rubbish trucks kid. - Hey! What the hell's this shit? What the fuck do you think you're doing? MAN: Piss off, sonny. Well, what are we going to do? Just let it play, No, man. OK. Said forget it. Hey, where's he going, man? Ska, where are you going? Listen, man. Fuck off, Andrew. Ska. Listen, I don't know what happened back there. I don't understand any of it. But I know one thing. You can take care of it. I know that because I've seen it. You can, you know. Got to go. I want to help. Yeah, maybe I'll see you around. Kind of late to be doing that, isn't it? So? It's time to sleep, Izzy. What do you care? I saw Fran where she works tonight. You know what she does? She works in a bar. So what? There's food in there too, you know. WOMAN [ON TV]: I had gone to sleep with my bedside light on. [INAUDIBLE] And I was just fortunate that I had my dog and I had my safe catch on. You shouldn't have to live like that, should you? You shouldn't have to live like that. And that's one, I think you really should ring Peter about that and [INAUDIBLE] even and-- [HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING] You're so hopeless. Christ, I feel old. There's got to be a better way. It's good money Matthew It's shit money. Since when did you give a damn about anything but yourself, Ska? All you're good at is playing games. Pretty soon it'll be the jail game, won't it? You'll be good at that too. Well what am I supposed to do? Be like everyone else. It's not so hard. Like you. Yeah, like me. At least I've learned something. You can't change things. You can't hurt people like Jay, Ryder. And you can't change things. If you see Andrew today, tell him, tell him to grow up, dammit. Two words, two little words. The system, that's right. The fucking system is gonna swallow you and me. The fucking system, designed specifically to get the world for the little man just where they fucking want you. Take a good look around. Look at you, sir. You're just another [INAUDIBLE] in the fascist bourgeoisie. You're another maggot in the life's festering carcass. You're a boil on the crotch of humanity. You're a tapeworm up a sheep's ass. You're a rat turd in a [INAUDIBLE].. Dad. Matthew. Bless you, son. Are you well? Frannie and the little ones, how are they? All right, I guess. That's good. That's good. So how are you? Me? Well, I've been worse. I have. [INAUDIBLE] They should never have killed your mother like that, with their drugs, their machines It's not right. Hey, I need your help. I want to talk to you about Fran. Do you know, they put them in the water, Matthew, these drugs. Aye. In the water we drink. Did I tell you that? In the sea itself. Did I tell you that, Matthew? Did I? Come on, Andrew, I'm serious, you know. [INAUDIBLE] wasn't here anyway, man. He's getting that look in his eyes. Because you're so fucking lazy. Hey, but I [INAUDIBLE]. Ain't that enough? Ugly and black. Hey, you could go it alone, you know. I wouldn't blame you. You think I'd do anything as crazy at that alone? It's personal for me too, remember? What do you think, you're Superman or something? CHILD: Hi, Ska. - It's going to be heavy. Hello there. I've tried talking to her. It's the only way. Well, we could still use some help. Let me ask around. Yeah, I've got enough people in the shit. I'm through with that. Can't cut out Slapper, man. He'd go bananas. [INAUDIBLE] Thank you.

It all happened so fast. They didn't even know what was going on. Wish I'd been there. You're crazy. I'm not crazy enough. At least everything's OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] I see that sign in your eyes. Love was fighting, never even tried. Came from the house of the broken heart. Now I know what would make me so happy. Sometimes you run and hide. With every little hurt inside. Catch a little light dancing inside you. That is my love getting through to you. Sometimes you run and hide. With every little hurt inside. Never want to see it again. I know things never go to plan. Will you look to be my man? You know what he said to me that first night? He said, she's only his sister, but I love her. You're not afraid. That's what I like about you. You're not afraid. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] Went out on the lonely night. The city was burning bright. I know things never go to plan.

Get away from us! Hold it, boys, hold it. Well, is it going to happen to your girlfriends down here or is it going to happen to you? Yeah, I thought so. The honorable thing. You're lucky, yeah. You've definitely got a lucky streak. You could've been killed last night. You would've been if I'd been there. And you are lucky I don't believe in the cops. These are my cops. And you've been nipped. You are about to receive a little lesson in law and order. Then we'll say no more about it. Right? Of course if there's ever the next time, you're dead. Well, and we thought you were smart. Isn't that right, boy? Kiss my ass. [SMACKS AND GROANS] Andrew. Hey, Andrew, you OK? Hey, no problem, bro. Ska. No problem. Hey, get an ambulance. Get an ambulance! I said, get an ambulance! So it was pitch black. You were wearing sunglasses and there was a total eclipse of the moon. Something like that. And you and your friend had a nasty fall. It's called honor among idiots. Who is he? Give me a break, Matthew. How else are we going to bring these culprits to justice? Or maybe we should give them a medal. Where is my mate? They're still cutting on him. It could have been you up there, couldn't it? He'll be back. They love this place. Can I go now? What do you reckon, Doc? You ever get tired of wasting your time on trash like this? They pay me for it. Hey, you're welcome. I want to find out about a friend of mine. His name's Andrew Policci.

And listen, it's not too late for you. STACY: For you? MATTHEW: Oh, yeah. STACY: Matthew? About the money again. MATTHEW: He's got to pay somehow. STACY: You can't buy Andrew back.

Flak, catch! Right, you bastard. Get out of my way. Shit! Stop him! [SIREN] I gave you a ticket. That pisses me off. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] I see that sign in your eyes. Love was [INAUDIBLE] you never even tried. Came from the house of the broken hearted. Now I know why you make me so [INAUDIBLE].. Sometimes you run and hide. With every little hurt inside. Had your little light dancing inside you. That is my love getting through to you. Sometimes you run and hide. With every little hurt inside. Never want to see it again. I know things never go to plan for you to be my man. Hey, I'm starving. Can we stop and get something to eat? Haven't got any money. No money? No money. No. Nothing whatsoever. I don't have any money either. And what have you got to say to that? [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] Came from the house of the broken hearted. Now I know I completely sold out to you. Went out on a lonely night. The city was burning bright. I know things never go to plan. There's lines in your hand. Got your little light dancing inside you. That is my love getting to you. Got your little light dancing inside you. That is my love getting through to you. Went out on a lonely night. The city was burning bright. Woo. I know things never go to plan. There's lines in your hand.
