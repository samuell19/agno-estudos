PEDAVI DAATANI MAATOKATUNDI School... it gives us a lot of sweet memories it's the life at school that gives us best friends that last life long. Love stories start right here. Another beautiful page in school life is the tuition centre. Boys and tuition centres share a special relationship. First reason for that is, after school hours, when we get out of home wearing a colourful dress after coming back from school, and move around with friends like heroes, that rocking feel can't be described in words, The second reason is girls, We communicate just with the girls who belong to our class in school, but there are girls who come from different schools in the tution centers, This is us. In our parents' words, we are the good for nothing ones. The last benchers! 90% of boys belong to this group. We don't really have any future plans. Our prime goal is to enjoy this moment, this day! Okay students, I'm giving you a small farewell party today. - Are you ready, Tarun? - Yes sir. Okay students, let us welcome Tarun and group. A future singer is going to perform for us here. I'm a star at my tuition centre. I've got plenty of fans here. Since a last bencher has become a star, they see themselves in me. I don't know if I'll ever get such a moment in my life or not. This is the only place in this world where I feel successful. Saptagiri Tuition Centre has a very important place in my life. Today's show was sensational! - Indeed! - That's because I'm Tarun! - What are they doing here? - Waiting for you. Love letters, eh? That doesn't suit them! Oh! Hey... Stop man! Girls, don't worry! Try me! Not interested? Damn your fate! Buddy... aren't those girls good? Why did you reject them? The history is going to change for the first time! A last bencher boy has rejected a first bencher girl! Anyway no girl is good enough for me in that group. What do you say boys? - Let's go! - Come. Bloody life! Working on the weekends too! Oh! As if you expect a great job for our education? Be happy, we have this job! "Aanati hryudayala ananda geetham song from Annadammula Anubandham movie" School gives us a best friend, Both would have just two options. One is both working hard together and succeeding in life, or as my father says ruin each other's life! We belong to the seond category. Dude... You're my best friend. You studied with me in school... ...been my college mate, dropped out after first year, now you are working with me, I'll give you a fat gift for your next birthday as thanks giving! I'm really very lucky to get a friend like you. But why don't I see luck even in my dreams! Mind your work! We're damned for life! Only we both are friends with each other, nobody else would dare to befriend us. It's my ill fate man! Were we normal as students? - Buddy... come my bro. - Hey Tarun. The trainees are waiting for you. Greetings! Our company supplies manpower to huge corporate companies. I train them. Good morning students! Good morning, sir! Students, what we do is really great work. Ours is the key role in every place. We start working before everyone else. Yes! If we're not there, not just this city or this country, but the entire world will plunge into chaos. So, you should be proud of your job. Yeah! So students, let's start! - Be ready with your equipment. - Okay, sir. I have three problems in my life. The first problem is my job, Who are we? Who are we? Toilet cleaners sir. We got a name boy! We're janitors, we clean floors along with toilets. - Okay? - Okay, sir. We clean things which people hate to touch. We're heroes! We have nothing to do with this society. It's society that needs us. We clean toilets with pride. This brush is our weapon. Can I go to the loo sir? Whatever I said earlier was just to inspire them, but not from my heart! They had come here just like me taking life easily having skipped studies. What a motivative training! I too want to clean something! - Yes. - Get lost man. Buddy! - Don't be so frustrated, buddy. - Why shouldn't I? I'm holding a dirty mop instead of guitar. I don't know what I'm really doing! What's there in it not to understand? You're senior trainer in Janitor Department Laugh at my expense! I'm not doing this job because I like it. The pay is good with less working hours. I can practice music in my free time, who cares about this dirty job! How can you get so dejected in a month? Do you know how many more toilets you've to clean in this city? Moreover Lemon Tech Service Providers is a big brand name! Bloody brand! - I've told all our friends. - What? That I'm an accountant and you're a trainer! Don't feel so bad, it's this way for a month only. - And after that? - You'll get used to it. You... Wash your hands, man! Waste fellow! How long do you carry that sorry face? Change your mood. Hey guys, our CEO has come. - He wants to meet you both. - Is the CEO here? We never knew it. Had you shown the interest you have on the girls around on the notice board... ...you would've known it. - She's got it. Why does he want to meet us? He wasn't here when you joined us last month, right? So, he wants to meet you guys. - Go quickly, he's waiting for you. - Okay. Come. Excuse me, sir. Why is he facing the wall? Is he shy maybe? Excuse me, sir. - Aren't you Tarun? - Yes sir. - And you're Abhay? - Yes sir. Did you recognize me? Why not, sir? You're our CEO. Dotted condoms... can you remember anything? - I generally don't use it. - Yeah. That's true. Pharmacy, lemon flavour, Saikumar. Tarun. Hi Tarun. Hey! The future Collector! I love music. - Can I join your group? - What? - I'll be your assistant. - My foot. - What do you say? - No. - Okay, boy. - Okay what? Music is an art, he's fat! Okay, but you need to complete a task to join our group. What task is that? What? You see the pharmacy there? Yes. Get a pack of dotted condoms from there. - A condom? - Can't you? - Let's go, buddy. - Wait a minute. I'll try. - God bless you. Go. - Go. You got only two minutes. We don't have much time, bloody lizard face! Go quickly, boy! - Hello. Anybody there? - Tell me. What do you want? I need a.. co... Oh that? Just a sec. Cough syrup. - Not this... - Then? - Do you want us to leave? - Come on guys. - A condom. - Condom. I want a dotted condom. Which flavour? - Flavour? - Yes, which flavour? Oh! He got it man! Tell him. Tell me soon. Is it Strawberry, chocolate, lemon... - Which flavour you want? - Lemon... lemon... My God! Rs. 70. - What are you doing here, Sai? - Mother! - Mother! - Shameless dirty rogue! We're struggling day and night to make you an IAS officer. - Are you buying condoms here? - Mother, please. - No mother. - What? Hey Sai. How are you doing? It's been years since we met! His lizard face hasn't changed over the years. The last we saw him was when he was buying the lemon flavored ones. Yeah. What happened to you after that? I was sent to a hostel fearing I may go wayward. My teenage was ruined because of you guys. - Is it? - Oh! I'm here to get my revenge for that. Oh God! Revenge? How you changed the course of my life with that incident! I decided that day, I must be in a position to make anyone fear to talk to me. I'm the boss of Lemon Tech Service providers. I started this with my father. Lemon Tech. This is what you call circle of life. You both are working under me. I tracked you both. I was happy knowing nobody was offering you jobs. Oh no! Happy? And because of me, you guys are here. - So, the entire credit goes to your father. - Indeed. - He's the CEO as his dad is wealthy. - Indeed. So, a condom has made you the CEO of a company, what makes us more happy than that? Entire credit goes to him. - Give us few shares of this company. - Yuck! This company? Shut up! Call me sir. If you call me by my name, I'll make sure you don't get a job anywhere. Understand? You signed a 6 months contract. You both have to be here. You don't have a choice. Both of you get out now. Second problem of my life is my boss. I mean this Sai! I was a star back then and he was a loser. But today I'm a loser, and he may be a star now. See that? There's still ego left in me. That's why I'm unable to accept him as a star. My third problem is Ahana. Rich, ambitious and beautiful girl. She's a creative artiste. These are not the problems. What's it now? Enough of blushing! We can't take it anymore. Tell me, what it is? Dear Tarun, My name is Ahana. I'm in... I'm studying in your school. I lost my purse. I need some money. Carry on. I really love you. I would like to have you as my boy friend. If you accept my love... We can be together for life. Is it? Give me your book. What's this? Does your father deal with oil? Here, read it. GET LOST SWINE. See Tarun, If you don't accept my proposal now, I'll not accept you even if you propose me nude later. Hey what? Are you warning me? What's this, buddy? Who will propose nude to you? You oily face! I'll hit you with my guitar. Move away! Come, buddy. Go home! Every girl gives me love letter. Did you see? She's the same Ahana! In school she was like cold Irani tea. But curse my fate, she's changed into a cocktail of Rakul Preet and Sai Pallavi. Biggest lesson of my life. Ugly school girls' metamorph into beautiful women. If I and Ahana marry and have children, that will be my first lesson to my son What? Whats that? Go and wash your face. Your mother too may fail to recognize you in so heavy make-up. Go, she is inquiring me! I love to tease Ahana. I forgot to tell you, I have a fourth problem too. A problem every middle class boy faces. My father! What? It's been half an hour since I told you to cut vegetables. Always after food, will you die if you eat food 30 minutes late? Look at that tummy. Looks like you may deliver a little brother to me in near future. I don't have big tummy, you've become too proud. Move! I asked for a good son, but you gave me a rogue. What can I do with him? At least you've an option to ask God, he gave me you without any option. Whom do I to complain to? If you talk like this, one fine day I'll go to your mother. I don't need that option, it's enough if you don't shout on me every day. Aah! Did you see the result of abusing father? It's my wife who did it. Thank you, my dear. I and my father Subbu, that's my family. We fight worse than mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. My friends have a problem that their parents don't spend time with them. But my dad spends more time with me even if I don't like it. That's my problem. Subbu doesn't know about my job. But I love Subbu's job. - I've installed CCTV, madam. - Okay. You can see what happens here through this mobile app. - Okay, sir. - Okay. - Bye. - Okay, sir. Thanks. Call me if you've any problem, madam. I'm a loser amidst all these problems. But I have hope that my life will change some day. Do your job with a smile, man! Smile man. "Like Michael Jackson, like Justin Bieber..." "I dreamt about becoming a pop star" "I went around holding a guitar" "I used boast around in my college like a singer" "How colourful those dreams were which I saw day and night" "When I opened my eyes, life turned black and white" "How much I may try, I never got a chance" "Fate played havoc with my life" "Fate didn't change even after falling so low" "It's shameful to share with anyone" What exactly had happened, brother? "Gone... life is totally gone" "Life is finished, I'm done with this life. Sing along!" "Gone... life is totally gone..." "Life is finished, I'm done with this life" "Getting up early morning, taking bath in cold water" "I practiced a lot but no use" "I visit temples every day and offer full scale prayers" "I prayed to all the Gods but but no use" - "Education went off track" - Is it?" - "No job" - "Is it?" - "Slippers wore out" - "Is it?" - "Made a mistake" - "Is it?" "Life is a bat and I'm a ball, it hit me and I got stuck here" "Your story is bringing tears in my eyes, bro" When bad times take over, life will become hell. "Gone... life is totally gone" "Life is finished, I'm done with this life" Won't you sing guys? Sing! "Gone... life is totally gone" "Life is finished, I'm done with this life" - What happened to him? - Aren't you ashamed to ask me do like this? Am I asking you to sell Indian secrets to Pakistan? Why should I be ashamed? It's against my policy. You can change your policy. Why not help him? Shweta, nobody dared to befriend you for your precocious behaviour. But I dared to be your first friend. Second person. I'm her first friend. Shut up, you're not my friend at all. Please, you're the only hacker I know in this city. Who else can help me but you? My father installed CCTV in Ahana's hostel room. - In her bedroom? - No. - It is in hall. - Thank God. She spends more time in hall. Please, hack just that camera. Please Shweta. I plead you. See darling, he's our friend, right? - Do it, please. - Hands off me. Look, you don't know how much I love Ahana. I'm unable to see her nowadays. But when I see her, I feel like watching her forever. I wish to talk to her. But she always talks to me angrily. I know there's love behind that anger. - She's my only hope. - At least you've hope, what about me? - Please Shweta. - Filthy friend. Why is she so stiff? How well you said that! Boys are good at words! Where are the details? Is Ahana your only hope? What am I and Subbu then? Come home, I'll take you to task. Wait, boy... What? Is she on job or checking Facebook? Keep quiet. I've a doubt, does she really know to hack computers? - She's the coolest hacker in this city. - Is it? - She helps police too. - Barbarous, man. - It'll be done by evening. - Thanks. - Anyways, good job, girl. - Hey you. Is there a camera in your home too? - Get lost, you bloody. - Just kidding, yaar. Nice. I want to hack her. Come. Yes! Thank you Shweta. Thank you. Ah! my darling. I love you. If he's kissing the phone and drooling, I'm sure it must be porn video. CCTV's were invented to keep an eye on rogues like you, son. Modern generation kids are a pain! Come out quickly, son. I need the pot urgently and I've to go to work too. You're a trainer, don't you know you've to get up early? If you watch dirty videos all the night, how can you get up early? How can you your bowel movement be normal? Hey...backdoor is on the verge of breaking. Come out, son. How nice it would be if CCTV is also in 3D! Then... Open the door, you dirty rascal. Thank God... Move away. Yuck! Oh my God! Why you are so shell shocked? Shocked? Thank God, I'm still alive. My foot. What the hell did you eat last night? You're the one who cooked it? Don't pick on my cooking but pick on your crap. If this carries on, I'll die soon and be with your mother. Subbu, you don't have the right to talk about my toilet habits. Did you teach me as kid how to use the pot or clean oneself? No! As a father, you forgot your responsibility. I learnt it on my own and am standing on my own legs. I'm a self made boy, Subbu. My foot of a self made boy, I'm getting late to my office. I'm unable to enter the toilet. Oh my god! So, this is the entire procedure. Okay? And finally... Stop it, boys! Am I inaugurating a shop? Dirty rascals! Yeah I'm in office, I'll call you later. Come with me. What the hell does he want now! Good morning Tarun. How was your day? Disgusting! I'm waiting for your answer. - Yeah, it's good, sir. - Okay. Go clean my toilet. - What? I'm just a trainer here, if you want I'll send Ramaiah. Oh seriously? Are you telling me what your job is? You've two options, one is clean my toilet, two, quit and be jobless. Bloody rascal! You want me to clean your toilet! Where is it? I know what your dream is! It'll never happen. If it does happen, our roles would get swapped. So, stop dreaming and do it. Yuck, he wants to clean it completely. Clean it...I'll clean it. Bloody! Every dog has it's day, I'll show you then. I have to get smacked by every Tom, Dick and Harry. Why are you back so early? Did they fire you son? Can't you ever speak good? It's not about good things. I just wanted to confirm it. I hate the job. It's kind of a torture. - What's wrong now? - What could go wrong? Our boss insulted him in public. I didn't get it but he too gave a piece back to him. I'm not interested in the tiff. I'm interested in what it was about. It's ill fate Subbu. What can I tell you? The fault is equally yours. You spend half the time at office and half for music. You can't justify either. I'm saved from your torture because of that job. - If not... - Am I torturing you? It's you that I think about. Did you ever finish any job completely? You leave everything in half. That's my bad luck. What can I do? I've never liked whatever I've done till now. Including my job. Whatever we do, we must do it sincerely son. You want to be a singer, you'll surely become one. I have faith in you. But you're getting frustrated about your work place. It's screwing up your concentration. It is not good for you. Whatever we do, we must do it confidently with a smile. Only then will others respect you. It'll improve our self-confidence. Others will take a step back. If you don't like the job, quit it. Concentrate on music. Think it over, the choice is yours. I'll finish my degree in 2 months. My contract too will be lapsed too. After that I'll quit my job and concentrate on music. That was in the first year. You dropped out of college along with this rogue. - Subbu! - Yes, dirty boy! It's a fact. You're the first person to write arrears for never completing degree. What can I do? Can your son become Einstein? He'd be just like you. Did you see how he's leaving carelessly? A new film 'Shouting Father Biting Son' is in theatres. Are you coming with me? I'm talking to you boy! Wait, I'm coming. Look Subbu, whatever we do, we must do it sincerely. Only then, we'll succeed. You try it. Bloody rascal. Didn't accept my request yet. All the girls are alike. What? Do you want to find your true love? No, thanks. These pop ups are killing me. Hell! Crap of a phone, I can't get the love that exists. What new love? How did this turn on? Father! Who is it? Father! Hey! What's this? Log in page? Now... log in now. Done! - Let me know if you face any problem. - Alright. Okay. - Thank you. - Thank you. Take it. Look at me, naughty fellow. Come on look here. Coming... Thank God! One tea, please. Cutie! - Who are you man? - Ziga! I'm Bunty. Didn't you register on a website last night? Nothing of that sort. My tea please. Make it one by two. What do you want man? Did you register or not? I did. I had to because of a virus attack. That's not virus but your fate. Not my fate man. Cancel the tea bro. You can escape from me but not from your fate, Tarun! How does he know my name? Damn! Always vegetarian! Don't you get bored eating leaves? First achieve something and then talk to me. Just to eat these leaves? Anyway, we've achieved already? We are proud trainers. You say you're trainers but never told me what training you give. - It's like... - I told you not to talk work at home. Eat! Why are you showing unreasonable anger on him? - Oh you love me a lot Subbu! - Keep quiet and eat. He's going overboard on my support. Don't act like an angry man, it's very funny. - Dirty boy! - Subbu. Won't you allow me to eat peacefully? These two are a headache. What's with him uncle? Still torturing me. Here she comes. Superb. What are you seeing, Subbu? Nothing. Just checking my office mails. You carry on. Okay. Who are you fighting with? Let it be anyone, I don't care. It's good. Is it her boy friend by any chance? I don't think so. How beautiful you are! Very beautiful. Blast him! Yes! It's a break-up! Everything is final. Yuck! What happened now? You had enough. Get out. Eat! Like father like son, worst fellows. That's the new pillow I bought with love. - He's squeezing it. - You're very charming. He's turning to be unbearable. "Sri Venkateshwara Suprabhatam By MS Subbulakshmi" What a surprise! The house looks as clean as a new bride cleaned it before mother-in-law's entry! - Did you clean the house son? - Yeah. It's you who told me... ...be sincere and happy in whatever you do. - Yeah. That's why I did it. Professional ethics! Move. Professional ethics? Is this what your work is? That's okay. It is enough if he does whatever he is doing well. Where is she? Is she inside? Ahana! Could you give me the ball please? - What are you doing there? - Ahana! Mr.Tarun, answer me I say! Here comes the fool! - The ball. - Ball? We bunked office to prepare for music audition man. Not to play on the street. Come to practice. Are you feeling shy? If she sees you like this, whatever impression she has will vanish forever. - Bloody constipation expressions. Come. - Go. Ahana! What do you want? Please give him any leftover food to eat. Fool! Would you shut it? Show your guts there. If they exist. Will you please give my ball? Double meaning too! Please, Ahana. Where are the other players, Tarun? Ah! What a dialogue! As if she doesn't know why he's here! They were here till now, they left just now. Unable to stand before you and see your beauty... They left. Only I can withstand your beauty. Others can't bear it. If you don't give my ball, I'll come inside and take it. They may consider you as thief. Ahana give it please. Thank you, Ahana. What now? Why should I give you? So that you throw it in again? - Would I ever do like that? - Ain't it your habit? I won't. I've got a meeting tomorrow. I have to prepare for it. Oh! So much make-up for preparation? - Bye. - Barbarious! Ahana, stop! Come now. She left. "Oh!

Who are you, man? Why are you following me? - Why are you irritating me? - We are... What's this? We are cupids! What's with these cupids man? Like a super power, true love is spreading all over world because of us. Hey Tarun, our fate have selected us for this. You didn't register that night because of coincidence. Because you were born for this. Story is very good. Narrate it to some film producer, not to me. Please, don't torture me. Tarun, go now, you'll understand this as time passes. My son didn't even switch off the lights. Hello, please tell me, sir. What's this, Subbu? Our client's camera has been hacked by someone. Hacked the camera? Who would hack the camera, sir? - You must tell me the answer. - Sir. - Find out who hacked it first. - Sir.- If client goes to police our company's reputation would be ruined. I'll check it. I'll check it completely, sir. Who the hell would've hacked it? Wow! Beautiful! What's it, dear? What's your password? I want to hack you! I want to love you. Sir, I've never seen you so happy. Is there any reason for your happiness, sir? Yes, I'm quitting the job next month. - And after that? - First change your expression. It's no sad news. I have other goals in life. I have to quit this job to achieve it. Can't avoid it. How can you be so beautiful? Actually... Hope you wouldn't forget us. That's the first thing I'll do. Why is he blushing watching something? Move. - What happened? - Don't worry, be happy. It's okay. Okay. Oh he's coming. - What are you doing secretly? - It's nothing. Hey, look there! Hey, don't tell her. Why are you hiding? She mustn't know I'm working here. 'You were boasting "whatever I do, I'll do it with a smile from today.' Come out! But not with my would be girl friend. They went inside the cabin, come out. Bloody, I'll kill him. Such dialogues will not suit you, forget it. - He's a pervert. - My God! Look, how he's holding her hands. You hide under tables and in restrooms, someone would wed her and take her away. By the way it's your fault. Why don't you propose her? I'll do that tomorrow. I'll not delay any further. And change your clothes before going to meet her. Filthy man! Here she comes! She saw me. I must tell her today. Ahana, I've been after you since 3 months. I love you. Please accept me. Bloody! Every man proposes her except me. I'll propose her today. Ashok, I told you I don't like this. - What's this again? - Why do you say that? Hello brother, move. Who is this guy? Ahana, that is... Actually... Oh! I feeling tensed. There's 20 ml rum is in this. This will help. What say you? Be quick, I too want to propose her. Shut up, you drunkard. Go away. Where do you people come from? Ahana, I'm scared how you would react if I say it. - Tell it quick, I'm tensed. - Wait man. Tarun, don't spoil my day, I've to go. Move. Ahana, please wait... What I actually want to say is... - I like your shape! - What? No no. Actually I wanted to say something else. - I like your mom's shape too. - Eh! Dude what? What are you saying? Why are ruining it? Please propose to her properly. - Don't ruin it. - What the hell! - Oh God! - Ahana, wait... One last chance finally please... What are you telling her man? Is it the way to propose to a girl? Now I'm fine. Ahana, if you accept it, I want to take away your virginity. Damn! Is everything fun for you? - You'll never better in your life. - Actually... Brother, I'll fall at your feet! - You proposed the girl and her mom! - What's wrong with me? You are awesome! You're my Guru. Brother, give me your phone number. Wait! Ahana! Ahana! Guru, please stop. Ahana. Ahana! "My Love Is Gone song from the movie Arya 2" What happened to you man? She'll never see my face again in this life. So here is this fellow! Did you propose to her, boss? You bloody! What do you want man? So you don't believe me? - What should I believe man? - Zinga! Details of couples we have to unite appear in this Ipad. Nobody else can view these details other than me. Really? Part 3 of film 'Yamaleela'? Give me. Can you please see this and tell me bro? - But there isn't anything here! - Please check it once brother. Are you mad? - Brother! - Get lost. I've got work man. Madam, could you please tell me whats here? What's there to see here? Don't waste my time. - Idiot! - Please madam. Will you please tell me what's in it sir? A couple's profiles, photos and details. Did you hear that? He can see it. Hello, I'm a cupid too. What? You heard me right, I'm a cupid. - Cupid? - Batch 2012, cupid no:1010456 That's why I can see these photos. - You're cupid... - Hi, my name is Vignesh. You can call me Viggy. Hi Viggy! I'm Bunty, batch no:2001, cupid no:988624 Hey! You're my senior eh? It's been 6 years since I registered. Is it a dream or for real? - Do you feel pain or not? - I can. Then, it's for real. You're a professional cupid from tomorrow. Be ready to start working. I don't get anything you are saying. What's this cupid? Look there! Cupid means God of love! Where ever there's no love, it's the duty of Cupid to create love. That too with the ones who are destined to be their partners for life. only then will their love stay forever. That's Cupid! That's us. "He is cupid!" Since cupids can't be on earth, they select few people to become cupids. We represent cupid like how the temples, churches and mosques represent god. But how can I be a cupid? You were a born cupid. That's your fate. - Isn't this because of the registration? - Yes. But registration is just a formality to get you into work. Such formalities are taken care by higher authorities. Higher authorities? Where do they stay? Nobody knows where they are and how they work! - Why me then? - Because you're lucky. Had I been so lucky, my love would've been successful. Cupids don't have love life. We can't even say I love you to our lover. It's a curse on us. - What? - A curse. We can only help couples to fall in love, but we can't personally fall in love. What are you even saying, bro? Don't over react. There is lot more in store. Cupid rule number one. You can't propose to girls in any manner. It may be I love you or will you marry me, darling etc. However you may try, it'll always fail. Cupid rule number 2. You mustn't tell a couple you're cupid and are trying to unite them, if you do, that love will not succeed. Cupid rule number 3 You can take help from others in this process. But you must take help without their knowledge. It's not that easy for a cupid to find another cupid. All of them are normal like us. When I don't have the opportunity to fall in love, why should I help others? Our love will make us selfish. Cupid means sacrifice. Aah! Cupid cupid. Hum bug! Tarun. See, I too fell in love with a girl. Her name was Revathi. What next? I had dreams about sharing my life with her. But the moment I knew I was cupid, my dreams were shattered. When my love Revathi married someone else right before my eyes, unable to express my love for her, I had to go through hell! God! It mustn't happen to me. I can't live without Ahana. My life is no good without her bro. Calm down Tarun. I want Ahana, brother. There will be a way out from this. Please help me, brother. But there's only one option, Tarun. - What's it? If you unite 3 couples within 6 days of you becoming cupid, you can get out of this. - Is that all? - Yeah! 3 couples in 6 days! I'll unite them. It's not that easy as you think. There are many different types of mentality in the couples we unite. They may be strangers too. Anger, hatred, jealousy between people, it's very difficult to unite such people. However difficult it may be, I'll unite them! There's another problem too. What's it now brother? It's already 2 days since you registered. Today is the third day. You just have 3 days left. You've another 72 hours only. Got it, Tarun? Brother, I'm doing a job which nobody would wish to do in this world. I'm cleaning the dirty stains of the people unwillingly! I'm ready to do anything for my Ahana. Please help me, brother! I missed Revathi because I didn't have self-confidence. But I feel like helping you seeing your self-confidence. I will be with you. We'll do it. "He's cupid!" "Cupid!" Can I get out from this if I unite 3 couples brother? Hopefully. - Can I meet Ahana then? - Definitely. Is it true bro? Tremendously! Guys, I got an assignment. I need to go. Good luck, Tarun. - Thanks. - Bye. Okay. - Bye senior. - Bye junior. Kunal, Ramya. I feel its enough if she looks at me with a smile. I like his innocence and he's very cute. Very good. There's Ramya. Here's Kunal. What shall I do? "He's a mischievous boy, he plays mischief" "He's a naughty boy, he plays naughty" "He studies the heart, changes your path" - "He makes you fall in love." - Super! "He's cupid!" "He's cupid!" Let's do it. Miss Ramya, Mr.Kunal. Get ready to fall in love today. He's coming... - Start your game. - Come on my boy... Are you boys always like this? My God! Cupids abscond! Slip out! How could she hit him like that? It's very difficult to unite couples. Disaster! First attempt was sensational. Kunal is scared of girls. From today he'll not even dare to see any girl. He won't. My luck is so bad, what can I do? Don't feel bad man. I think it's the assignment. Okay, I'll meet you later. Bye. Cheer up. Hey! You street mongrel! What happened? - How dare you hack my client's camera? - How did he come to know? That too the camera I installed. Idiot! I lost my respect in office because of you. Subbu, this isn't right. Listen to me. What's there to listen now? You're dying in my hands today. Your age doesn't permit chases. No Subbu. Don't! 3 more days, I mean 72 hours. I don't know what turns my life is going to take in these 72 hours. Every moment is important to me. I'm yet to give a music audition. My first attempt as cupid too was a failure. Sai is the biggest villian in my love. My father is trying to kill me with his new slippers. But Ahana... I may be a loser or a janitor now. But I'm a last bencher! Last benchers don't fall in love. And if they do, they'll not fail. Ahana, I'm coming for you. Why do you feel so bad? What else can I do then? If you like her so much, go and propose your love to her. Why are you getting me involved into this mess? Would anyone hack a CCTV? Had you used this knowledge for better, you would've succeed in life. I can't propose to her directly, father. You're talking as if you know everything. Do you know what a big mistake that is! Had you mother been alive, she wouldn't chase you with slipper. she would've thrashed you with it you useless bugger. Perverted intelligence. I can't propose to her, how many times do I tell you? - Don't you've courage to do it? - Yes, I don't! So what? You lost your face in office because of me, right? Forgive me. I'll never again cross your path. Hey! It's me who should get in and shut the door. Not you! First uninstall that app. Yeah I'll do it. Did you uninstall it? Or shall I do it for you? Okay, I did. Where is he? If you do this again, I'll complain to the police myself. Stop it dad! Hello! Where are you? Why do you worry where I am, tell me, what's the matter? I must curse myself for calling you. Bloody life! Are you feeling bad? Go through it. How dare you talk like that to me! What's this non-sense? "Pedavi Datani Matokatundhi song from the movie Thammudu" Even a romantic song is like tragic song to me. What a life this is! What are you looking at? It was good that Tarun rejected me that day. Why do you say so? I loved Tarun from quite a young age. But I didn't love myself. But after he rejected me, I understood how self-confidence is necessary to us. Today I'm successful because of him. Do you think this way too? I feel some day he'll realize his mistake and come to me. Let's see! If you like him so much, why don't you accept his love? - No. - Why? If we accept whatever they say, what's our value then? This is the problem with such boys. As a girl, I need respect. When he comes to me with love and respect, and proposes to me, I'll accept him then. If not, no. You mad girl. What's your madness! Boys like him do anything for love. As you wish. What's it now? Janitor! My god! You and your damn things, who called you here? Get lost! When everyone used to come to me calling my name I used to go after Tarun, I'm being crushed between the father son duo. Damn my life! Vinod, 32 years. Love failure. - Interesting. - Very good man. Still a bachelor. He's a sculptor. "They sculpted beautiful statues on rocks." She's here. - Vinod! - Hi! - Hi! Her name is Smita. She's an architect. She likes Vinod a lot. That's why she gives many orders to Vinod. But she's a widow. So she is hesitating to express her love to him. Smita comes here every day only to meet Vinod. But Vinod doesn't know that. Now, you have to unite them both. Okay, bye Vinod. - Okay, bye. Thank you. How are you going to unite them now? I'll unite them at any cost, brother. Don't know what's going to happen! I know what to do, come with me. Come, brother. You're Mr.Vinod, right? Yes. - Hi sir, I'm Tarun. - Hello. - We work in Smita madam's office. - Hello. Oh! Smita madam left just now. Keep it down. - Infact we came here to meet you. - For me? Yes sir, we want to gift madam a statue of herself. Oh, that's good! - What's the occasion? - No special occasion. Madam wants to donate her property and go to Himalayas. - Is it? - Yes sir. What a woman! Yes sir, so once madam leaves, we'll keep her statue at our office. We want you to sculpt it for us. Sure! But why did she take this decision? What can I to tell you sir? Madam needs a life partner. So, she decided to marry a man with similar tastes. But every man was interested in her money, not even a single man wanted to marry madam! Madam likes you. - What? - I'm coming there. I mean a honest guy like you. Unable to find a honest man like you, madam has decided to renounce this world. Sir, how long will you take to sculpt the statue? -15 days. - Okay, sir. Sir, please don't discuss about this with madam. Sure, I'll not tell her anything. Okay, sir, let's go bro. Sir, if you know any honest man who isn't greedy about money among your friends, and of he is a virgin... What are you saying? I mean may be not a virgin, - Come. - It's okay if he is experienced. - It's okay even if he is experienced sir. - Bye sir. Why is he talking like this? Bro... Has he gone to get some experience? Why is it closed? Isn't your sir here? - No, sir. - Why? - He's getting married today. - Marriage? - Who is the bride? - Some widow! A widow? It's a success! - Thank you, brother. - Hey boys! Sir... Thanks a lot sir. - You're really great, sir. - Thank you so much. You opened my eyes last evening. I used to fear how to face this society. But after you told me about Smita madam, I felt like marrying immediately. Thank you, sir. Sir! Why are you thanking me? Why do you say that? You gave a new life to our madam. Can't we at least say thanks to you? No! - I married my college girl friend. - What? Yes, we loved each other while studying in college, like all other parents, our parents rejected our love, few years ago, her husband passed away. I'm single and feared to approach her. I was scared that my Roja too would renounce this world I married her. - Thank you. - Get lost man. What happened? What about our Smita madam's position? How would I know? You and your damn love. Come brother. Tarun. What about your statue! The sculptor screwed up. Hey what's wrong? - Assignment 2 is chucked. - To hell with your statue. Let's go. - Hey, Tarun - Waste of time, brother. Stop. Please listen to me. Tarun. Ahana! - It's her Brother. - Who is she? Tarun. What happened? Ahana is along with Sai, bro. What a wonderful conflict of timing in your life! Wow! What's my damn fate! We don't have much time left. I'm also scared, brother. Sai is always with Ahana. - I have an option. - What's that? - That is... - Tell me brother. - It actually is. - Come on tell me, brother. What I'm going to tell is... Why not remain a single like me and your father! You... Get lost, brother. You are always into making fun. I've got one idea. - We need a cupid consultant. - A consultant? When a fresher cupid like you can't reach the goals, you can take help from consultant to complete your task. Had you taken advice of consultant, wouldn't you be with Revathi now? I didn't have anyone to help me like im helping you now. I didn't know these tricks back then. Its okay, brother. Think about my love, brother. What's there in our hands? But I've a phone in my pocket. Come! Where's the consultant, brother? Must have been here by now. It's good to know about the consultant. But can they help us? Here comes consultant! Wow! Cupid... Wow! Are all consultants like her? Not all but I consult such consultants. Stop brother. Nice! Oh no! She pushed him away. - Who was that bloody. - I'm so sorry. - I didn't see you. - That's okay. By the way, what's your name? How easily she managed to unite them? Welcome Guru! Hi. Priyanka, consultant. I'm Tarun, janitor. Good. - Follow me. - Sure. Do you show him any live demo? Yes, Guru, just now he saw your talent. - You united them so easily. - Cool! Look there! "He's a mischievous boy, he plays mischief" "He's a naughty boy, he plays naughty" "He studies the heart, changes your path" - "He makes you fall in love" - How simply are they uniting lovers? - "He is cupid!" - Are they cupids too? Did you watch? He joined this cafe as waiter to unite lovers. Is this their full time job? Not everyone, but some of them. Cupid means sacrifice. Cupid means distributing love. What's the difference between us and brokers? - Tarun, we're cupids. - I know it. - Love is important to us. - That's my problem. A couple we unite never get separated. - But brokers are not like that. - Right. They consider money, caste and religion etc. - To unite a couple. - You're right. Understand? - Yeah, understood. - Bunty told me about your deadline. - Did he? - If you want to get out of this. only way out is to work with total belief and conviction, I'll surely do it for my Ahana. Surely. One minute, please. - Hello. - Let's see. Hello. Where are you? I'm busy, I'll call you later. Cut the call. Hey! Sai is very serious on you for not attending office. Better to be in office now. I'm stuck with a worse problem here. Hey janitor, if you lose this job, nobody else will offer you a job in this world. It's you wish then! Ah! Okay dude. I'll put an full stop to Sai and his office, I'm coming. A full stop? You mean the end! He's here. It's a daily torture, where is he? He's in his cabin, he wants to talk to you, go inside. I'll make sure he leaves this city forever. Don't pick up fight with him. Are you here? Wait there. Suit must be perfect. How long will it take? Hey! Clean this room. Clean it I say! Ahana, meet my school mate Tarun. Mr.Tarun, meet my friend Ahana. Ahana, he was a hero in school. Now, he's cleaning my room. Once in a week, he cleans my toilet too. Whatever we do, we must do it confidently sporting a smile. Only then others would respect you. They'll take a step backward. Hi Ahana, nice meeting you. I'm Tarun. Well, I'm a trainer here. Trainer-in-chief! Boys! Yes, sir. - Boys... - Hey! Crazy. - Clean the room in 10 minutes. - Okay, sir. I told you to clean the room. - Boys! - Sir! Yes, sir. - Is it done? - Yes, sir. Sir, toilet, sir. Come. Get the bucket. - Hi ma!- Did you meet Sai? Yes, ma. Sai is just a good friend from my school days. Ahana, you're not a kid. Think practically. Sai is good boy and rich too. You'll take good care of you. Mom, but I'm not yet ready to marry. Ahana, this is the right time for your marriage. Sai respects you and your work. What else you want? I'm giving you 2 days times, think over it and tell me. If you don't tell your decision in 2 days, we'll come to India. - So, first 2 attempts were failures. - Yes. He is left with juts one day. - Actually, these girls are... - Senior, just a moment. - Are you going to talk about girls? - Yes. You may die, man. Drink slowly. Girls are like Wi-fi. They scan all boys and get connected with rich boy only! Exactly, you're right, senior. Yes. Hey you Revathi! You're very good girl. But I've become a useless modem. Your heart is so pure, senior. So pure. "How sweet love is." "Lover is so stubborn." "I churned the sea of milk." Remix! "How sweet love is." "Lover is so stubborn." "How sweet love is." "Lover is so stubborn." "I churned the sea of milk." "I swallowed the poison." "How sweet love is." Revathi... Cupid. Tarun. What happened? Why are you so dull, brother? - I lost my Ipad. - Lost? How did it happen? I don't know. I was the best cupid till now. But for the first time a black mark in my career as cupid. Every time I unite a couple, I always saw my Revathi in them. I used to be happy personally for my every success as cupid. Don't worry, brother, you'll find it. I don't know Tarun, I'm unable to bear the loss. I wasn't so careless ever in my life. Bunty, it might have fallen down somewhere. Chill, you'll find it. Cupid. What happened? High school students. Let's go. That's Anand, bro. Raksha. My senior. She is elder to me. I feel age is not a factor in love. If my love succeeds, I'm sure she'll look after me like my mother. Matured idiot! He's worse than you. There's a Sai in his life too. Poor boy, brother. Looks like you got connected to him because of Sai's name. Listen, I've got an idea. Awesome idea! I'm sure it'll work out. - Hey, well said. - Hey, Tarun! Sir! - How are you doing, sir? - I'm fine, how about you? Super, sir. What else, sir? Any work in this school? Just a small errand, how come you're here, sir? I'm a teacher here. He's my friend Bunty. - Hello. - Hi. Priyanka. - Hello - Hello. My tuition master. My strong support those days. I'm very happy to meet you after a long time. Are you happy sir? You're the only one to miss me. I'm your biggest fan Tarun. Please don't fool me sir. They might think it's true. That's a truth man. I love to sing from my childhood days. But I couldn't because my parents stopped me. But I was very happy whenever you sang in the tuition. - Okay! Does that mean you are a singer? - Yes. You never mentioned it! So, you kept your talent a secret. - Not a secret man. - What's this sir? I keep singing in temples, schools or village functions at times. Please do invite me for your next performance sir. - I'll come along with him. - Sure. I want to see how many marks you'll give me. How can I judge you sir! Sorry, I think I stopped your work. We need a bit of your help for our work sir. Why did you arrange this singing competition now Tarun? Raksha likes singers very much, brother. Anand is a good singer. But nobody in school knows that. Now, we're making Anand sing in school, Raksha will fall for him after that. How is my plan? Oh... Why doesn't he sing before her? He can. But basically boys are innocent, brother. When a boy shows his talent in front a girl, they call him a show off If he remains silent, they mock him as useless. Approach her through a friend, they would say you are timid. And if you try to break the ice or propose them.. ...they decide we're desperate. If we love her, we must propose her. We must propose to her even if she loves us first. When you ask them why, they'll ask you if you can't understand. It's tough to understand what girls speak. How can we interpret what they feel? Poor boys, brother! 80% of boys don't approach any girl because of this confusion And you're asking him to sing now. How? How I say? How much you've learnt from me, Tarun? I'm proud of you my boy Students, there is a new inter-school singing competition. So, we want to send a fresh new talent to the competition this time. That's we've arranged this audition. Anand, please come on stage. Don't be hesitant. Sir... Come on. Please come on stage. "Easy... easy... easy" "Words come out suddenly" "Crazy crazy" "Like a song this way" "When I hum on the stage for the first time." "I don't know what this new feeling is" "My heart is singing in full volume changing from silent mode" "Waiting for no one, A walk without companion" "I'm meeting only myself, it's too boring" "It wants to share a unexplainable feeling" "is ringing like school bell" "On the first bench in the class room with pink lips" "Smiling cutely" "In lunch break with red hot box" "she shares Upma Dosa with others" "Is it her?" "She's right before me" "She's looking at me" "Differently" Anand! Super my boy! Anand, stop! - Wait man. - Super performance dude. - You were rocking. - Thanks. - We didn't know you were so talented. - Thanks a lot. - Okay bye. - Bye. You sang really very well, Anand. It was sensational, you know! Thanks. She started it. Do you know you're a star now? - Bye. - Bye. - Raksha. - Yeah. Will you come along for a movie and dinner this Sunday? I thought you said boys are poor souls. Indeed! But they never let go any chance. Do you think she'll accept? I don't think the god knows it too. It's fate. Why wait till Sunday? Shall we go right now? She accepted! Yes! First success. First success in my life after my school days. Though this success is small, I'll never forget it in my life. I saw myself in Anand. This is not just Anand's success. It's my success too! Oh next task! What is this? Sanjana to Sanjana? Oh! Interesting! Explain to him. How is it possible? Tarun, if we want to achieve something in this world, first we must love ourselves. Unable to prove to this society and cracking under pressure, we consider our self as useless and can't do anything. My name is Sanjana. I'm a good painter. I lost colours from my life because of a man. He's Vaibhav. I sincerely loved and proposed to him. But he rejected me by my looks and humiliated me with his words. It's good the useless buggar rejected her. Her life would have been ruined if he had accepted it. Ever since then I started hating my life. I really love you. - I would like to have you as my boy friend. - GET LOST YOU SWINE What are you thinking? Wouldn't Ahana have felt so bad too? I was immature to have commented on her looks badly. Whatever it may take, we must bring back colours in Sanjana's life. Good morning, madam. We are the corporate developers of the Indian economy of the century... ...management team. - Hello! Whom do you want to meet? We want to meet Sanjana madam. Sign the register and go. - I'll sign it. - Okay, come. Where is she? Tarun, there... Is the work done, Sanjana? I'll finish it in an hour, sir. Clients are waiting, let me know once it is done. - Okay, sure sir. - Okay fine. What else? I'm coming. She looks good man! Idiots! What's our plan now, Priyanka? - Tarun - Yes Folks, today we've a small team. - Hi! - Hi dudes! They go around featuring creative paper on their Facebook page to create awareness about various art forms, we would like to have your co-operation. - Okay sir. - Sure. Carry on. Yeah. Thank you. - Tarun. - Yeah. - Sanjana - Yes. We'll start with you. Me? No! Today's topic is self-loving. To convey how important is to love ourselves. It'll motivate a lot of youngsters. I'm wrong person for this topic. But I don't feel like that on seeing your art work. Guys, leave me alone. Many youngsters are falling into depression unable to take failures and rejections. They really need motivation. Can't you understand when I tell you? Please leave me alone! If you don't want to say it, you can choose to express it in painting. Why me? Aren't there are so many of them here? We came to know you're the most loving and talented person here. Stop being sarcastic. Just leave me. Please, why can't you can say something about this world and love? Yeah. Why don't you say something, Sanjana? It'll reflect how creative our employees are! Guys, now please leave me alone. Sanjana Interesting! It's fantastic! What's the meaning of this? Can you explain this, Sanjana? What am I to explain and how? There's no true love in this world. Whatever is, it is after looks and money. Every relationship is expecting something in return. It's fake love everywhere. This is love. I just showed how you feel when love faces rejection. Hello mom! Tell me, dear. We're going out for dinner tonight, don't cook at home. Inform dad too. Is it really you, Sanjana? - Sorry, mom. I really troubled you all these days. Sure, I'll inform your dad. Forget that, come home early. We'll be waiting for you. See...what did I tell you? She's a changed person now. Yes! Do you love yourself? I love the wife more. - Are you sure it's your wife? - No sir. - Naughty boy! - Oh sir! Just one more thaskto finish and Ahana will be mine. Hey, it was sensational. It's easy to unite two people. But it's very difficult to make one love oneself. Super! Thanks, Priyanka. Hey! No need to thank me. I don't think you need my help anymore. You're an expert cupid now. - I have to go. - Ok captain. Priyanka, look into my eyes and say bye. Bye. - Bye! - Bye. - I'll ride bike now, brother. - Okay. Keys, brother. My Ipad! How come its in his bag? Keys, brother. Brother... You would understand if you hear me out bro. Brother, please. Bro, please hear me out. Brother, I didn't do it intentionally. It was wrong to cheat Bunty. But I'm ready to do anything for my love. I have faith that I'll come out of this problem. On the other hand, I fear that I might not get out of this problem. But one thing is true, my love is honest. If Ahana comes to me with oily hair and thickset glasses like in school days, I love her. I've realized now what true love is! Thank you, Sanjana. Cupid. Cupid. Abhay and Shweta. "I fell in love with Shweta at first sight." "Because of that useless Tarun..." You're finished, idiot. "I couldn't propose to her." "I truly love her." It's very easy to unite Abhay and Shweta. Then it's just me and Ahana. Yes! Tell me, Subbu. What? I'm coming. What's this? What do you mean? Don't you havee any shame? And you call yourselves best friends! Why are you shouting on me? You don't shout now! Thank got he was lucky. He tried to commit suicide by jumping from terrace. He was saved he landed in a trash truck. If not... Don't always be so selfish, think about others also. He is a fatherless boy, he's part of our family. Take care of him. Tell me the truth, Didn't you jump in that trash truck wantedly? Stop it man. That's okay, why did you jump? It's Shweta. I always like crazy girls like you from childhood. He'll never change. I don't mind if you hack and cheat. I'll marry you and change your life. I love you, will you marry me? How dare you call me a cheater? Hey! You missed my second line, I said I'll marry you. - Listen - I know. You booze. Is that all? It's totally okay. Two pegs every day and pubbing once a week. I'll cook an half boiled omlette for you too. Will you marry me? Listen Abhay, I'm already engaged and my wedding is tomorrow. Who has such bad taste now a days? Who would dare marry you than me? That's my wedding invitation. I'm getting married tomorrow morning. Don't ever come here again. She's getting married today. May be it's done already. That's why I jumped. You don't need a suicide. I'll kill you myself. Useless bugger. Is it a way to propose? Infact you've insulted her. Do you've any sense? Can't you tell me before meeting her? I didn't insult her man. Mine is true love. My foot love! - Hello! - Disgusting. Office? I'm coming. You... Hey janitor! - What happened? - Sir, look there! - Congratulations, sir. - Thank you. - Congratulations, madam. - Thank you. - Congrats, sir. - Thank you very much. Congrats, madam. - Congrats, sir. - Thank you. Congrats, madam. Hey Tarun! Please come. Meet my fiancee Ahana. Tarun, you don't love me or have respect for me. I waited years for your love. But you never dared to propose to me. I'm just a joker in your life. I'm sorry, Tarun. You don't deserve me. I've called you to inform that you're not welcome to my engagement. Thanks to my friend, we wouldn't have met without his help. Noting personal, Tarun. Why the shock? I warned you earlier. I'm the best cupid amongst all. But you cheated me. My fame is more important to me than your love. You hid my Ipad and spoilt my name. Consider this my revenge. Congrats! Congrats! What did you talk to him? I just asked him to work hard. Hello Tarun, I'm performing a show, would you like to come? Sorry sir, I can't come. "Are you ready? Join me" "Say 1, 2, 3, 4, 5" "No... No..."

"Rock it!" "No, no. Say no to love, Life is beautiful" "No, no. Love is big drama" "No... no..." "Love is nothing but drama" "No, no. Say no to love" Hello! Looks like you are not in a great mood! Take it. - Cheers! - Cheers! I too was just like you at your age. If you're like this, it's not your fault. Our middle class families are like that. We hurt ourselves by underestimating us. It's an identity crisis. Who are we? What are we doing? Why are we doing it? To get out of these confusions and complexes... ...we need self-confidence. I mean self-confidence son. Without proper education, without proper jobs, I used to struggle a lot, I was very depressed then. After meeting your mother and talking to her, I gained a lot of self-confidence. I felt she was born for me. I won your mother with that confidence. Had she been with us now, our lives would have been different. Fate! Hey! The beer is turning flat, have a sip. Take a gulp. If you feel your life is zero without a girl, win her over at any cost, if not it'll hurt us all our life. Hey listen! I told you earlier and im telling now. I've full faith you'll win her. Thanks for your faith in me Subbu. But she's getting engaged in few hours. Marriage is months away, we can stop it, it's not big deal. But there's a bigger problem than that. Neither can I tell you nor you can understand. How ever big or serious problem it may be, you can solve it with your confidence. I wouldn't mind if you fail in your studies or job. But son! I'll not accept if you fail in love. Thanks for your motivation dad. But it'll not happen, forget it. Mad boy! If Abhay and Shweta can't unite, won't you and Ahana not get united too? Go and propose to her from the bottom of your heart. Try once again sincerely. Let's see what happens after that! Dad! One minute! How do you know about Abhay and Shweta? That information is just in my Ipad. No way you could see it. How did you know it then? I'm asking you, answer me dad! Subramanya Seetharamaiah alias Subbu! Batch no:1976! Cupid no:23! Are you Cupid? Yes. I fell in love with Sarada Devi. I came out of the curse in 24 hours to marry her. The only cupid to create history of uniting 3 couples in 24 hours. That's Subramanya Seetharamaiah alias Subbu! It's not my track record! It's an all time record! Every attempt was a success. Every success was a milestone! Yes. Got it now? Go win the girl. You're my son. Prove that you are my tiger cub. Awesome dad! I love you, my son. All the best! - Which floor is the bride on? - Upstairs sir. Thank you. Ahana, I wanted to tell this to you since a long time. I know this is not the right place for it. But if I don't tell now, I can never tell you, Ahana. Every time I see you... What are you saying, man? Ahana. Actually... I... I... It's like Ahana I'm unable to... Tarun. Tarun! Ahana. Tarun! Auto stop! Where do you want to go, madam? - Get out! - Oh no! My father said if we decide about something we can achieve it. But the more I want to be near her, my love is taking me further away. Tarun. Are you mad? Why did you come and why did you go away? Nothing... just like that. - What area this is? - No, I don't know. I know why you came so far for me, Ahana. Let's leave it here. I'm not right choice for you, this wouldn't work out. I can't even tell you that I love you. Huh! You said it! What did I say? You said I love you. Eh? Oh! How is it possible? - Hello! - Hey, janitor! Shweta has accepted my love. - Shweta? - The hacker dude! Oh! Did Shweta accept you? She cancelled her marriage man. - Marriage? - Marriage... suicide... trash truck. Is her marriage cancelled? Super boy! - Congrats dude. - Thanks man. - Are you coming? - I'll be there in few minutes. By the way, how did the marriage get cancelled? - Nothing much dude. - Nothing? Come on, tell me. Okay, bye. One minute please! Hello! I'll call you later, cut the call now. Abhay's call. At least now, will you propose to me properly? Watch now! How I'll propose! Ahana, I... Once again! Ahana, I... Just a minute! Irritating idiot! You're finished today. - What are you doing, man? - Brother! I'm cleaning, bro. Would anyone clean with this? Take that. Some people never change in life. Take it, brother. Hold it this way. - One, two, three. - Okay, brother. - Okay, where's phenol? - He'll never change. - It isn't here brother. - Bring it. - Okay, I'll bring it. - Idiot. One minute. Spray thrice with it. One, two and three. - How many times? -3 times. Hold it. Like this, clean it beautifully. - Okay, brother. - Cleaning is an art, hold it. - Hey.. - Brother. - How many times we've to clean? -3 times brother. Look brother, - Brother! - If possible quit this job. - Join a good training centre. - Okay, brother. Lesser working hours, good salary. - You can work and chase your dream too. - Okay, brother. Okay? - Okay, brother. Remember this. Don't ever join the company of the man you see there! If you join it by mistake, your life will become hell. Okay, brother. - Do it well. - Okay, brother. Cutie has won. - Are you done with him? - Yeah, finished. Why didn't you teach him few more things? Why are you so cross? He's also a last bencher like me. Who else would guide him? Okay, tell me quickly. Ahana! I love you! What? Why do you look that way? Looks like you've forgotten something. Not this? What else could it be? I'll not accept you even if you remove clothes and propose me. Go ahead. Really? Don't you know about me? Remove them. Do it. I love you! Cupid bless! "I'm having a lot of dreams with eyes wide open" "You have made me dream in the morning" "The dreams I never had till now..." This is called circle of life. I found my life back at the place I lost it. One thing is true, there are no winners or losers here. Who are you, man? I'm the last bencher baby! Hey stop! Why is noone here? - Hey - Tarun. How is the house? We'll live here after our marriage. - Hello! - Hello, uncle. Check the salt in dal dear. I prepared it. Tarun, we are selected in the auditions. Super, buddy! - Congratulations, dirty boy! - We're a band Subbu! Who is that girl? - She's my... you know... - I'm going to get the clothes from terrace. What happened? Is she your girl friend? She is my girl friend but a very important person to you. What? Hacker Shweta! Don't you know to cook or pack other than hack? - Sorry uncle. - Why sorry? Why sorry? What did she hack? - Actually the gas is on. - Hey you. - Uncle. - I'll check it. Why did they leave suddenly? You saw me as a janitor till now. But I'm a musician from now on. Not just me and Abhay... Stop dad! How dare you set up camera in my room! I'll hit you with stones. Aren't you ashamed to chase father with slippers? Why should I feel shame? You're shameless to fix camera in son's room, why should I be ashamed? You're dead today! Stop there dad!
