- What if I told you there was a group of film makers so provocative, so electrifying, that anything they touched turns straight to gold? Well they exist, and they go by the name FND Films. Three boys from sweet home Chicago with a combined 30 years of experience. They do it all, writing, lighting, directing. - Action. - And audio. With 300,000 subscribers world wide it's no surprise they have amassed over 100,000,000 views. But so what? These guys aren't in it for the accolades, they're in it to make good honest work, and they're gonna do it for you, for a reasonable price. FND Films. - Please hire us. - Wow. - Wow, um, that seems very impressive. - Well, we are 100 percent committed to delivering the most exemplary product possible. - Right, I understand that. But guys, this is overkill. - Overkill? If I may... Just point out there's plenty of Joe and Jane Schmoes out there puttin' up content. You know, not everyone is gonna give you art. - Mm. - Um, guys, this is my son's little league game. - And it's gonna be the best damn little league game you've ever seen, because it's one of our productions. We're gonna mic up the umps, we're gonna have drones circling the outfield. - I mean imagine your son, Kevin, steppin' up to that plate - Oh, yeah. In crispy slow-mo, he's cranking on that bat! Errrr! - Boom, he knocks the leather off the ball, the crowd's stands up, they're going wild! - Ooh! - He hits third, - Ooh, Kevin! - He's circling home, We see it in a telephoto lens. - You see the beads of sweat dripping as he's running, he's chugging along, he slides into home plate, his cleats are kicking up dirt, the dust settles, the ump calls, and he's out! "You're out, you little bitch! "You disappointment! "Dad's mad!" I'm sorry. - Hey, he's passionate, he's passionate. But you know what? So are we. And guess what? You're gonna get a Blu-ray DVD after the game. - Ah, no. I'm gonna have my other kid shoot it on a smart phone, okay. The quality on these now-a-days, it's good enough. All right? - It shoots 1080p. - Yeah, we're familiar. - It also has slow-mo on it. - Oh, did you go to film school? - No, did you go to butt school? - Ohh, very clever. - That's hilarious. - Hey, let me tell you something about cinema, kid. - Mm-hm. - Mise En Sc... - Did you? - What? - Did you go to butt school? - No, I... - All right guys, guys, guys. I'm sorry, it's a no. I appreciate your enthusiasm. Good luck with your little films, and your company. Coop, tell your mom I said hi. - Yeah, yeah okay, okay, Brent. - Thank you. - Thank you for your time. - Sure. What does that even mean, butt school? - Well I like to think it's school for butts. - Okay, sure, but is a bunch of bare cheeks walking around trying to higher their education? - No, no, no, it's normal people learning about butt stuff. - Guys, who cares? Okay, we just lost a gig to a 12 year old girl. We need to start looking for real jobs. - Well I'm gonna take a real job with Mary at the juice joint, so... - Oh, and there goes the neighborhood. You know what? I'm gonna go out, and I'm gonna find work for us. How 'bout that? - Oh yeah? And how you gonna pay bills 'til then? 'Cause you owe me 50 for electric. - I'll take out another student loan. - Oh, yeah, 'cause you don't have to pay those back, moron. - Okay, all right, let's not be downers about this. We don't need the negative energy right now. Hey look at us, right, come on. We're three young, super sexy, hot, dudes taking charge, about to make this city our bitch. Right? Come on! - All right. - All right, he's on board! - Yeah. - Let's fucking party, you guys, shit yeah. - Let's party. Yeah, but if you guys are only gonna drink water, you're gonna have to go. ♫ Don't fight me 'cause I'm on your side ♫ I'm on your side ♫ Just because I'm wrong doesn't make you right ♫ - Bye bye, have a nice day sweetie. - Okay, so please make sure you vacuum today... ♫ Occupations outta sight outta time ♫ - Yes. ♫ Outta time ♫ ♫ One more chance for me to swallow my pride ♫ - Bye. - Let's play ball. Come on now. ♫ I can't sit still for too long ♫ Let's hurry up and leave ♫ This life is not for everyone. ♫ No kind of guarantee ♫ They say we're wasting our lives ♫ But you can sing with me like ♫ La la la, la la la la la ♫ La la la, la la la la la ♫ - Yeah, sorry. I don't have any work. But pop in next week. You know, you never know if a side job's gonna come up. - I will, thanks OJ. - How 'bout your movie stuff? You make any money with that? - No, man, it's dead. We had to let it go. - Well, coffee's on me. - Thanks man. - Are you still chewing food? - Damn it! - Drink fluids, drink fluids. - I don't want any more fluids, piece of shit! - Are you still chewing food? - Come on. Oh man, it's okay, I know this thing looks stupid. - No it's, uh, what is it? - Drink fluids. - It's a life fork. - Keep chewing. It's a fork that plugs right into your phone. And it's supposed to help, like, regulate your digestion patterns and all this nutritional shit. And you know what? The software is all fucked up right now. Chew food for 90 hours. - Why don't you just return it? - I wish. I spent like $100 on one of those crowd funding websites just to get it. So, no refunds. - Really. How much money they make off of those? - I don't know, like 150 grand. - 150. OJ, you hear that, 150 grand? - For a fork? - It's this whole crowd funding craze. Like truly, I get so swept up in stuff like that, that I will throw any amount of money at anything stupid. It's like any idiot with a turd of an idea gets $100 of 'ol Dana's money. God, I am fucking stupid. - So we crowd fund a feature film? - Yes! You guys, I don't know why we didn't think of this before. Crowd funding is so hot right now. This is our chance to do something we love and get paid for it. - The great white whale. - Sounds better than working at the juice bar. I'm barely making ends meet. Oh my God. It's two bucks. I'm doin' it. - You really think we can raise enough? I mean a feature's pretty expensive. - We totally can. I was researching campaigns last night. It's a gold mine on there. People are raising money for all kinds of stuff. This one guy raised $50,000 just to make potato salad. - What? - Holy shit, I love potato salad. - I love it too, and guess what? We ain't pitching no side dish. This is a feature for the big screen. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. We can have a premier, okay. We can invite all our friends. - That's what I'm talkin' about, Vin, Vin? - Yeah, I'm into it, but we don't even have an idea. - We don't have an idea. - That's the best part. With crowd funding, you don't need an idea. You just need blind passion. That's what people are investing it. As for the plot details, just tip-toe around that. - Yeah, yeah, I like that, yeah. Just tip-toe right around. - Look at that tip-toe action. - Details, tip-toe around it, tip-toe around it. - Vin, Vin? - Huh, huh? - Yeah, I'm into it. - He's into it! - Yeah! - Let's make a movie! - Woo! Wohoo! - Hey, I'm Aaron. - I'm Vinny. - And I'm Cooper. - We're FND Films. - And we've got something to ask you. - Can uh, we have some fuckin' money? - That's right, Aaron. We're not gonna sugar coat it. It's simple, it's our first feature film, and we need a little bit of help. So what's this movie about, anyway? - What is it? - Well it's an action comedy starring the three of us, - Mm-hm. - With locations, dialog, - What? - Characters, - Yeah? - You ever heard of Mise en scene? - Yeah. - Well it's in there. - Oh good, thank God. - Yeah. - We can't tell you much about the plot because of major spoilers, but if you throw us some dough, we'll tell you some mo'. - And if you give us 100 bucks, you can even be in the movie. - So what are we gonna spend all this money on, anyways? Well here's a pie chart, and that's got percentages on it, so you have to believe us. Look, we're gonna do this movie regardless, and we would really, really, like your help. So please. - Please. - Please. - Just give us some fuckin' money. - Just give us a little fuckin' money. - Give us your fuckin' money! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop, Cooper. - Ah! Give it! Give it to us! - Is it too aggressive? - I think I was screaming too much at the end. I might have blown it. - It's fine. - No, no, you guys, this is good. I mean, we're being transparent. That's what people like. - That's true, that's true. - Okay, okay. - Honestly, I don't know how you guys are gonna make any money off of this. It's really vague, and you guys seem so desperate. But it's fun. ♫ Ooh ooh ooh ♫ Just give it a week ♫ I'm sure that you'll feel better ♫ Just give me those good things, good things, everything ♫ When I'm feelin' under weather ♫ Just give it a week ♫ I'm sure that you'll feel better ♫ Just give me those good things, good things, everything ♫ When I'm feelin' under weather ♫ - Whoa. - Just soak it in, it's glorious. - Looks like we're making a movie, boys. Now we just gotta write the thing. - Dude, that's the easy part. We got, like, so many ideas, though. - Yeah, yeah we do. - Yeah. So, so many. - I mean we got, like, some. Fuck, we have no ideas! - Ok, this should not be this hard. We've always wanted to write a feature. - Yeah, yeah, you're right. All right, first thing that comes to mind, go. - Oh, uh, how 'bout the one with, I don't know! - It's okay, hey, that's okay. All right, tabula rasa. Let's start with something else, genres. - Yes, I like that. - Cooper. - Yeah, yeah, mumblecore is a genre. - No, not really. - Right, right. - I got it! Sci-fi film. We're gonna do a sci-fi film. It's about this alien, uh eh uh, and he's also a, he's a pervert. Uh, yeah, right? He spends his days watching chicks from trees, saying perv stuff like... - Oh, yeah, get it goin'. Love that, baby, take it off real slow. Ah, who's this dork? Wha, awe, get out of the way, mha. - Peeping tom, eh? - Oops, he saw me. - Then he goes home, right? And he can't stop talking dirty. He's watching TV, and he's like. - Oh, yeah, that's some nasty static. - And he's talking to his lasagna. - Mm, you're a dirty dinner. - To himself in the mirror. - Oh yeah, you're such a little slut. No I'm not. Yes you are. I'm gonna fill me up. - Whatever, it's a start. - That's not bad. Hey, you know what we could do? A love story. We've never done one of those. - Those things sell. - Right? Okay, we start on a artsy-fartsy, moody, musician. He's up there, and he's playing his show. He's like... - I love you girl, and hate the government, blah. - You suck! - So after his show, he's packing up his things. He still sucks. - You still suck! - Kill yourself, loser. - And this beautiful woman walks up to him. And she's like... - Oh, you strummed your way right into my heart. - And he's like... - Well that's 'cause I play from my heart, hergh. - Then they're back at her place, real romantic, candles and shit. He leans in to kiss her, and she's like... - No wait, I have a secret to tell you. - What? - I'm a demon. - What? - So bathe in my blood while I escort you to Hell! - No way! - I'm sorry, that got real dark. - No, no, no, no that's good, that's good. Let's roll with that, okay. Um, we could do a spooky movie. - Ooh. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It starts with uh, it starts with this girl, and she's walking home, and she's all... - Oh, a girl like me shouldn't be walking the streets all alone. - But she is, she's so alone. Just then, she's approaching this suspicious looking bush, and when she passes it, there's no one there. It's just a bush. She goes home, her closet's kinda open. It wasn't like that this morning. But then she remembers, oh yeah, it was like that this morning. There's a thump in the attic! Is anyone there? Of course not! For 90 minutes it's just her almost getting scared. It's freaky, right? - These ideas suck. - Writing is hard. - Look, I'm just gonna say it, all right. We're financially stressed, and it's smothering our creativity. - Yeah, do either of you have quarters? I can't do my laundry. - No, I just spent the last money I stole from my wife, I'm out. - Hey, I know what'll help this. - Well, you are in luck. Looks like the money deposited to your account this morning, $77,900. - Uh, so, so it's in there. - Correct. - Right now. - Yep. - Yes. Yes! Woo! Yes, yes, yes, yes. All right! Sorry, um, I would like to have that. So, to go, take it to go, the money. - Oh, I would really advise against that. That's an awful lot of money for you to be walking around with. - Yeah, maybe it's not the smartest thing. I understand that, but, I mean, it would just be super tight to have, like, in person. So, just, can I have it? - Uh, gotcha. Um, let me go talk to my manager about that. - Thank you. Now it's a bit musty, but it should do. - Are we sure it's safe down here? - Oh yeah, no one comes down here. - Except our landlord. - Yeah, but she's about to die, so. - Oh, okay. - So, you boys wanna see it? - Yeah. - Me too. - Whoa. - Look at all that bread. - Awesome. - Hands on the cheddar, boys. Okay, just like we practiced. - I, Cooper, - I, Vinny, - I, Aaron, - Do solemnly swear to uphold this oath. We are ready to be financially responsible and commit our time to making a feature film. But first, we do need to pay rent and shit, so we'll each take a small cut for that. And, maybe, also just a little bit extra to have fun with. Because, let's be honest, we've been super stressed. And shits sucked for a while, so the money could help us relax. And lastly, but not leastly, we are best bros, for reals. Friendjamins before Benjamins. This will not become another Facebook situation. We are not Mark Zuckerberg, and we will not zuck each other. - Off. - The end. - That felt cool. - Not bad, not bad. - Yeah. So what do you guys wanna do first? - Isn't it obvious? We make it rain. ♫ I love, I love ♫ I love, I love ♫ Do do-do do-do do ♫ Do do-do do-do do ♫ Unbelievable, unbelievable ♫ Do do-do do-do do ♫ Do do-do do-do do ♫ Simply natural, simply natural ♫ Do do-do do-do do ♫ Do do-do do-do do ♫ Unbelievable, unbelievable ♫ Do do-do do-do do ♫ Do do-do do-do do ♫ Simply natural ♫ - Ha! - No! ♫ Do do-do do-do do ♫ Do do-do do-do do ♫ It's so magical, it's so magical ♫ I love, I love ♫ Do do-do do-do do ♫ Do do-do do-do do ♫ It's so magical, it's so magical ♫ Marco. - Limo. - Marco. - Limo - Limo - Marco!

I think you might be the perfect man to head it up. - Ohh, you know a lot of people here say I'm all head. - Ah, ha ha, do they? - Yep. - Not sure why. I'm gonna give you my card, and when you're done with your little party thing here, you're gonna call me. - I will call you. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You know what to do. - Be on the look out. - Okay. - Ring-a-ring ring. ♫ Licks, licks, licks, like my licks, licks ♫ - Hey, yo! Aaron Fronk. What's up man? I donated to your film. - I'm sorry? - Dude, I gave you 1000 bucks for your movie. - Oh! Ah shit, duh, yeah. - Yeah, dude, so um, what's it about? Tell me about it, man. - Uh, the movie! Uh... No spoilers. - Oh, come on, man. I gave you 1000 bucks, just give me a little something. - Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, it's about this guy. This guy, and, and uh, and he's got a problem. - Hey, why ya hidin'? Come inside, we're about to pop bottles. - No, I'm okay. - What's goin' on? - I think I'm gonna go home. - What, why? What, the party hasn't even started yet. - I don't wanna be here anymore. I am so sick of watching you spend your money on stupid things and trying to impress your new friends. - Well, okay, did you even take the time to meet them. They're all super nice people. - Damn girl, you a twerk god. - Okay, Vinny, maybe this money is our opportunity to do what we wanna do. Let's get out of the city. - Yeah, that sounds great, let's go on a vacation. - No, more than a vacation. I need a cleanse, okay. And I've been doing research. There's this place, it's a self sustaining community. And they all live off organic food on this farm, it's called Papa Pete's. - Put your finger in my ass! - Okay. - Yeah, that sounds dope. - Yeah? - Yeah, that sounds like really, like, awe man, I'm excited. - That didn't even sound genuine. - I am excited. - Okay, Vinny, just do me a favor, and think about it. - Ah, shit! - Hey, hit me with a condom, G, real quick. - No! - Come on, man. - No. - Fuck you, then. - What's wrong Aaron? Are you not enjoying the Cave of Serenity? - No, it's invigorating. It's just, are you guys worried at all that people might be on to us? - Nah. - I guess I'm just tired of lying to people when they ask what the movie's about. - What have you been telling them? - That's it's a sci-fi film called Under Collapsed Stars. - Dude, I told someone we were making a spaghetti western. - Okay, damn it, we need to communicate. - Fine, from here on out, we're making a spaghetti western. - Well now that doesn't really matter, Vin. Shit man, and I was already anxious about this. Now I'm really freaked out. - Prom. - What? - We cut everyone in line at the prom and beat them to the punch. Then we spike that punch with a shit ton of sleepy pills and put these concerns to bed. - What are you talking about? - We tell people we're not making a movie before they find out we're not making a movie. - And if people don't believe us? - Of course they'll believe us. We just have to tell everybody that something terrible happened on set, and there was a struggle for creative control. You know, bull shit like that. Blockbuster movies will million dollar budgets and A-list actors fall apart all the time. And eventually people just accept. - And then they forget. - Bingo. - All right, not making movie update video, take one. - Okay, okay. Now get the boom up, Vinny. And, talk. - Hey everybody, so back in 2014 we asked for your help in raising $75,000... - Na-na-na cut, cut, cut. - What was wrong with that? - Um, it was good, it was really good, man. I just think it might have been a bit too happy, okay. And this isn't something you want people thinking that we're happy about. You know what I mean? - Okay, right. - Okay, so I need it to be a lot more sad, and give me a ton more shame, right? - Yeah, I mean I could... Remind me again why I'm the only one doing this. - Oh, well, I mean, we only wrote the script for one person, and you have the best face for delivering bad news, so. - It's true, you do. - Great, so when everybody gets pissed it's just gonna be at me. - No, no, no one's gonna get pissed at you because you are gonna deliver this with as much guilt and genuine remorse as possible, right? - Right. - That's right, okay. And guess what? - What? - You're letting a lot of people down, here. And that's a good thing, right? - Right? - Okay. - Okay. - Okay, Vin? - Still speeding. - Still speeding, and you're the dude. You are the dude. Okay, from the top, here we go, and, talk. - Hey everybody, back in 2014 we asked for your help in raising $75,000 for our first feature film. It was a success, we hit our goal and then some, and we are so grateful to everybody who donated. It means a lot to us. Which is why I'm so sorry to announce that due to complications and things beyond our control the movie can no longer be completed. Um, it just, we can't make it happen. Um, we're very sorry. We know a lot of people were really excited about this. We were too, um... I guess all we can ask is that, you know, you stick with us for what we have planned in the future. And again, we're so sorry. - Lightning in a bottle. - Yeah? Was that the one? - All I'm saying is, is if I donated to the movie, and then I saw this video, I'd be like, it's all good. - Yeah. I think we got it. - All right! - Woo! - What the fuck FND? - This is a bunch of bullshit. - Like what did you even do with all that money. - Nothing, nothing, I got nothing for it. - Honestly, FND, I do not know what to say. - Where the fuck is this film? Where the fuck is my money? What the fuck are you even doing? - I gave $100 to FND to make this damn movie. - Like what's your mission statement if that's the way that you're gonna treat people? - What ever happened to like, $15 I'll take a T-shirt? - You say, "No, close the door, "end of the project, it's over." - Now it's like $100 for a concept of a T-shirt. - There's no movie? Was there ever a fucking movie? - I bet you didn't even think about the film. - You're sick people. - Fuck FND Films. They're full of liars, they're pieces of shit, and fuck 'em, especially Aaron fucking Fronk. I see you, bitch. Fuck you. - Yo, you think you're gonna take my paper and you not gonna come out with no movie? It don't work like that, homie. Watch your back, watch your mother fuckin' back, son. Now to continue with my review of the brand new Star Wars X-Wings miniature Corellian Cruiser. First off the colors is bananas. - Coop! Cooper! - What? - Dude, people are really pissed. Did you see how mad this guy is? - Yeah. - And what are these boxes? - Welcome to Ground Zero, Vince. Here lies the epicenter of my newest endeavor. - Creams by Coo. - Cremes by Coo. It's a skin lotion company for ugly people. - When did this happen? - Well, I met this hunk of a woman at the party. Her names Angela, possible future wife, and she told me that she could triple my investment in 3 weeks, dude. - Ooh. - Also, we're hiring entry level positions at the end of the month, if you're interested. - Eh, right, yeah, okay. Dude, we need to focus on this, all right? These people are mad at us. What is, what are we supposed to say? - Uh, fuck 'em. - What? - Come on, man, this is a good opportunity. - What's up, dude? Whoa, whoa, Aaron, slow down. - Look at the logo, it's got my name on it. - Okay, yeah, we'll meet you there. Jesus. - Oh my God, so fucking good. - I'm pretty worried, man. Aaron sounded worried. Should we be worried? - Dude, oh my God, relax, all right. It's Aaron, okay, he get's Aaronoid. This is what he does. In his mind shit's always going down. - Guys, shit is going down. - See, what'd I say? OJ, would you please throw a Xanax in this guys coffee when he gets in here? - Yeah. - What, no. - No? - Really? - I got' em. - People are on to us, okay. They know we are scamming them. - The videos, did you see the videos? - Yes... - You guys are crazy. All right? It's not that serious. - Oh, it's not that serious. Hey, Vin, it's not that serious. How 'bout the brick that came through my fuckin' window. - Holy shit! - Dang, you lied? - We all lied! I'm getting death threats, okay? People are saying they wanna gut me. What if it was some mobsters daughter that donated, okay? - It was probably a bunch of kids, all right. They're just being kids, it's what they do. - What do you think, OJ. - Maybe they meant to hit somebody else. - Yeah, that’s true, yeah, you think? - Oh, no, wait, it's got your name and address on it. - Oh shit. - Hey look, if you need any money I can get you some work. - There's a bigger problem. There's a much bigger problem. - What? - Damn, fuck. Igby's dead. - Yeah, it was a direct hit. I think the brick killed him instantly. - Well that's not so bad then. - How? - Oh, well, I mean, he was pretty much three paws in the grave already, right? You know with his cataracts he kept running into walls, and then he had those weird little bumps on his back. And then he has those hard little bumps in his throat. He shit everywhere, he pissed everywhere, he threw up everywhere. Remember that time you found a whole nest of spiders in his back? - All right, we get it. - Look, it doesn't matter. Julie loves that dog more than she loves me. If she finds him like that, I'm fuckin' dead. - All right, chill. Let's uh, figure this out. I see a robbery, I think people broke in, Igby scampered off. - Yeah, that could work. - Yeah. - Yeah, th-tha-that works. - No, his brittle little bones would have exploded on the jump. - Well then they took him! - Why? - Who cares, okay? Just help me get rid of the body. I'll figure it out later. - Okay. - Uh-Uh, I'm nut touching that thing. - Why? - I didn't touch it when he was alive, I'm not touching him now, okay. He's probably riddled with rabies. - Dogs don't die and get rabies. - Oh, I'm sorry, are you a veterinarian? - All right, I got an idea. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - All right, all right - Towards the door. - All right. - All right, we got it, good. Come on, hey, hey! - Holy shit! - That was you this time. - I'm sorry, it just keeps touching me. - Let's do this again. Did you hear that? Did you guys? Oh shit, Julie's home. All right, lock the door! Shit! Ah! - Vin! Open the closet! - All right, Someone's coming down the hallway. - Ha! - Kick it in, come on kick it! Get it in there. - Come one, Igby, get in there. - Come on, get it in there. - Jeez, seriously, man? - God, I broke something. - Kick it in! - Oh shit. - Just get it the fuck in there! - Oh, it's just the neighbors. Oh shit. - I'm sorry, man. - Sorry about your dog, dude. So, this whole thing is pretty messed up, man. Hey, you know, let's do something. Let's do something, let's have a, let's have a funeral for Igby. - No, it's fine. You don't gotta do that. - Uh, hold on, there's something to this. We could do like um, like a memorial service, okay, celebrating a fruitful life that Igby lived. It'll be like a few friends, a couple drinks, we'll send him off the right way, peacefully. - Sounds weird. - Nah, it'll be good. - And that's basically the bottom line. I-i-i-i-it was my nephew. - Oh, you are kidding me. - Oh my. - Are you k... - Hi, thank you for coming, remember Igby. - Hey, have you talked to them yet? - No, not really. - Why not? - I thought about it, and I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while. - Vinny, we've talked about this. Don't you want to walk barefoot through fields, and take a juicy strawberry right off the vine? - Uh... - Don't you wanna make love under a Douglas fir. - Well yeah, duh, you know I've always wanted to do that. Ow, it's just his dog just got assassinated, and I think... Hi, thank you for coming, remember Igby. We should wait until after this sacred occasion. - Is this a sacred occasion, or is this Cooper working an angle? - Babe, no, how could you say that? Cooper would never. - With money enclosed, thank you so much. Oh, yeah. It's all for Igby. Let's remember that. - Igby, yeah. - Take care. - Take care. - Okay, bye. - Peace be with you. Fish in a barrel. - I'm impressed, this is a good turn out. - I know, thank you. - It could be better. - You're right, it's shit. - It's a start, but I just think we have the potential to build something great. - Um, you um, you think we have uh potential. - The company. - Oh sure, the company. - The company. - Mm-hm, mm-hm, loud and clear. Our company. - Yep. Let's cheers to it. - Sure. - All right. - Oh. - Oh, shit. Aaron, hey. Aaron, hey, you're here way too early. - What's going on, who are all these people? - Uh, they're friends of Igby. Hey, so let's take a walk. Okay, let me tell you about this trip that Mary and I are planning. - What's this? - You don't wanna read that. - Why? - Because you don't. So, we're going to this organic farm. And we'll eat right out of the dirt, and the stars at night will be so bright. - Did Cooper put you up to this? Is this Cooper's idea? - I'm not supposed to tell. - Mm-hm, yes. - Uh, attention, attention please. Just simmer down. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Cooper Johnson. I'm the CEO of Cremes by Coo. Why on earth would makeup companies test their products on beautiful creatures like this? - They're monsters! - You're damn right they are! Little Igby here's a martyr for all animals. Animals enslaved in the cosmetic industrial complex. Now, at this point, I'm sure you're thinking to yourselves, you know, how can I help. What can I do to get involved. Well, I have a solution, and it's only 29.99. For every case of Cremes that you purchase today, it's one less dead dog. Think about that. Little Igby really would've liked it. Isn't that right cutie-pie, hm? Hm? Oh you'd like that, would you? - Awe. - Whoa. Sorry, I got just a tad emotional. I'm uh, vulnerability at it's finest. Listen, we got a five drink minimum here, so let's not let this damper our time. Let's have a blast, okay. Swag bags on the way out. Don't forget those, okay. Come on, let's have a good time. Look, I know this looks bad, but to be fair, you weren't even supposed to be here for like four hours. - Animal testing? What's cream? Okay, what the fuck is going on? - All right, why don't you take all these negative emotions, put 'em in a basket, and push it down the Nile, okay? - Igby's decomposing in front of a bunch of people I don't know. Okay, it stinks out there. - And Vin's taking care of it. - I don't know man, this doesn't feel right. This is just low. - Well, it'll start feeling good once you see our return on investment. - You just said our investment. - I said what? - Our investment. Coop. - I don't think you should be freaking out about it. - Do you know what I've fucking been through? People are after me! Where's my fucking money? - I see you're stressed. That's okay, we all get stressed. Why don't you get in, give me a hug. Oh! Oh, oh. - Tell them now. - We're leaving. - Good, me too. - Chicago, we're leaving Chicago. We're gonna go live on an organic farm. - Nice, good for you guys. - Thank you. - Thanks Coop. - No! No thank you. Cooper stole our money to put it into his stupid company. You know that? - Well, yeah, we're all investing in Creme's by Coo. That was the plan. - What? - What? - And I thank you both for your support. - Well, yeah, we don't need dirty old money when we're living off the land, right Mary? - I'm getting a drink. - Well, get me one too. I don't know what that was about. But, I'm excited for my new life. It's gonna be pretty great. - Vin, I love you, but you're being used by everybody around you, and you're too stupid to realize it. - Ha! No, stay out of my head, Aaron. I'm my own man, I choose to invest in Cremes. I choose to eat dirt and walk through the strawberry fields, and be organic and live life. And you know what, another thing, I'm gonna have sex in trees. Yeah, jealous? 'Cause that's what I really like. That's my choice. - Are you reading from a cue card? - Does it sound like I am? - It doesn't sound natural is all. - Fuck this. Cooper! - Yes? - Hello, young lady, is your mother home? - You're so sweet. May I help you? - No, but I'd like to help you. Very nice, and then the other side. - Ooh, this one smells really good. - Those are the hibiscus petals that you're smelling, Ruth. It's part of our geisha blossom series. Locally grown ingredients, soy based protein, very organic. - It's starting to tingle. - That means it's working, Ruth. So, how many can I put you down for, a baker's dozen to start? - Oh, I don't think so, dear. You see, I'm saving every penny for my grandson's college fund. - Totally fine, totally fine. Don't wanna add any unwanted stress. Pressure's bad for the skin. - Mm-hm. - You know that. So I suppose I'll be just packin' my stuff up, getting the heck outta here. Oh, who is this lovely lady? - That's me as a young woman. - May I? - Oh, of course. - My goodness, what a peach. You know, Ruth, wouldn't you like to go back to these days? Kick your heals up, go to the ball, dance the night away? - Well, that was a lifetime ago. - What if I told you I could take you there? That's right. You see, Ruth, these aren't just ordinary creams. These are Cremes by Coo. They're a portal to the past. Ruth, they're a time machine. Now you know just as well as I do that behind all these wrinkles and all this muck, there's a beautiful girl itching to come out, and I can take you there. What do you say, Ruth? - I wanna be her. - Great. Rubbing it in there. If you could, uh, uh, remember a time. I'm gonna stop talking. Let's let the cream talk for itself. I appreciate your business. ♫ Up on Papa Pete's farm ♫ Beautiful sunshine all day ♫ Bubbles in my face, up on Papa Pete's Farm ♫ I love the beautiful breeze ♫ I love the birds in my trees ♫ Bubbles in my face up on Papa Pete's Farm ♫ - Can you believe how beautiful this is? - It's great. - Hi, friends, you must be Mary. - Debbie. - Yeah, oh. - Oh, oh my God, it's so beautiful here. - I know, it's immaculate.

I'm gonna have to ask for directions. I don't know where I am. - Aaron, listen to me. These people are really hungry. - Well, look, just tell the guys to have a snack. Oh shit, I hit a pothole. - Wait, what? - I gotta turn around, the hoagies are everywhere. - No, no, do not turn around, keep going. - No, I'm just gonna pull into an alley. - Aaron, no! - No, I'll call you back, I'm gonna pull over. - No, wait. - Don't worry about it. - Do not hang up! Shit. Shit. God damn it. Oh! Oh! Oh shit. Oh shit! Oh no no no no no. It's coke! - One new voice-mail. - Aaron, it's OJ, buddy. Uh, I'm guessing you looked in the back of the van and you know what's up now, so. Unfortunately, things have to end, between us and between you and everybody else. So, get back to me, or I'll find ya. Okay, bye. - Aaron Fronk, hey man, so good to see you. Hey, listen, did you get any of my emails? - Uh, hey, it's good to see you too. - Hey, is it true y-you guys aren't gonna make the film anymore. What's up with that? - Now's not the best time. I gotta go. - No, no, listen to me, okay? You're special to me, and your film is special, and I gave you money, and you gotta show me something. - Get out of my way! - I donated to your film, man! You can't leave me hangin' like this. - Uh, excuse me? I'm looking for Cooper Johnson. - Uh, Mister Johnson is busy for the next two years. - What, two years? That's absur... Well, I see him right there. He's literally doing nothing. - All right, the truth is, he's in a pouty mood today, so please don't go in. Dang it. - Cooper! - Mr. Johnson, I tried to stop him, but he sprinted right past me. I'm sorry, and I hope you still value me as a member of this team. - It's okay, Michael. It's okay, I got this. Aaron, what's up, man? You like the new digs? Can I offer you a e-cigarette? - Uh, no, no. When did all this happen? - Well, when you were too busy hiding in your stink-hole, I was here building my creme-pire, from scratch. - Jesus, so it all worked out, I mean... I mean, wow, I always knew it would work out. But, wow, man, it worked out! - Yeah, we're probably going international soon, gonna take over the Asian market. So, cha-ching-chong. - So you're just, like, rollin' in the dough. This could solve everything, Coop. - Solve? - Yeah, look, look, I need some help, okay. I think $50,000 would cut me loose with the shit I'm tied up with OJ, okay. Well, maybe a little more, now that I think about it, to temper some of the angry fans we got invested in the film. But after that we are good, okay. I think we can save this. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah, dude, let's do it, come on. - Okay, yes. Okay, and we should do big bills. Big bills the better, hundreds. - Big bills. - I'm talking crispy, crispy $100 dollar bills. - Oh, only the crispiest for you, my man. - You got it here? - Yeah, yeah. - You got the, you got the money here? - I do, yes. - You're not, and you're not gonna give it to me, are you? - No. - But you zucked me! - No, I gave you an opportunity, and you pissed it down the drain. Now look at you, coming in here begging on all hands and knees like little orphan Aaron. "Oh, oh, please sir, Mister Coo, "oh, can I please have a suckle of your teat. "Ooh, I need milk to survive." No, you cannot. This teat milk is not for you. And you'll never get any. You're pathetic. - Michael. - Yes, Mister Johnson. - Michael, Mister Fronk is leaving. Please call security. - What, are you fucking kidding me right now? I have the most illegal van in America parked in the parking lot right now. There could be a god damned suitcase nuke in there for all I know. - Then get it off my property. I don't need you blowing my creme all over the city. - Get off of me. Shit. Ah! - Beautiful hits, Andy, one two three. - Ow. Okay. - Aaron wait. Look, if you're really that hard up for cash, why don't you take your whiny plea to Vinny. He followed Mary's dream, and now they own an organic farm. I wonder where you went wrong. Okay, one more. - Cooper, how are things going? My life is great. I totally didn't make a mistake by coming here. Peace, love, sunshine. 56, Vinny. - Ma'am? What the fuck? Are you, are you okay? Hello? Ma'am. I can help. - Oh, Coo, thank you for taking me around the world on your creme ship. Oh, it's my pleasure, there. I'm just trying to help a little... - Mister Johnson? - Yes, Jacob, yes, hello Jacob. I was strategizing. - I, uh, wanted you to know that everyone's leaving because their checks are bouncing. - Uh, w-w-what are talking, I thought things were on the up and up. - Yeah, until a large transfer was made to your offshore account this afternoon. - Offshore account, Michael where's my offshore account? - I have no idea. - Well, would you get Angela on the phone, please. Let's figure it out. - I'll look into it right away. - I wanna see that money on shore, okay. Is that how it works? - I also came to tell you that I'm leaving too, so. - Well I expected that outta you, Jacob. No one's gonna miss you, Jacob! No one's gonna miss Jacob! Except for me! - Coo, we have a bigger problem, there's news vans outside. - I'm busy. - Coo, with all due respect, you gotta tackle this head on. I'll go out there with you, and we can do it together, how 'bout that? - No, Michael, I couldn't ask that of you. - Good, 'cause I didn't wanna do it anyway. - What? - I'm leaving too. - Papa's coming. - Vin. What the hell's wrong, are you starving? - Yes. - All right, get up, we have to go. - You're gonna have to carry me. - Hey, I drove four fuckin' hours to deal with this shit, okay, let's go. - Carry me. - There, there he is! There he is! There he is! - I told you. - I told you second. - I told you. - Hey, boy, lookin' for an honest day's work? - Uh, no thank you, just here grabbin' my friend. - Raisin' the white flag already, 56! - Don't listen to him, come on. - Almost made it what, a week, before your boyfriend came to save you? - I was the best worker you had! - No, not by a long shot. - I gave you everything! I gave you everything. I'll show you! Ah! Ah! - Whoa, don't breath that shit! Way to be your own man, 56! - Put me down! Put me down! Put me down! 22! 22, where are you? Let me go to my son! Fuck you! No! No! 22! 22! - This is Angela West. I'm out of the office. If you're calling about Cremes by Coo, please redirect your call to Cooper Johnson. Thank you. - Angela, hey. Uh, third time calling. Uh, sort of in the weeds over here. Did you know that the creme is totally burning people's faces, 'cause that's a thing right now. So please don't touch it if you're anywhere near it. Also, the office building's kind of tanking. I had to fire Michael, things got a little hazy. But we are in a bit of a pickle, so if you could please get back to me at your earliest convenience, I'd greatly appreciate that, okay. Thank you so much, I love, er, thank you, and call me back. Um, thanks. - So can I get you boys anything else, like dessert? We have dessert crepes or a scoop of pie. - No thank you. - How 'bout some of that chocolate mousse? Doesn't that sound yum? - We're good. - Maybe I wanted some dessert. - You just polished off two omelettes, you're fine. We should be headin' out. - Don't tell me I'm fine, 'cause I'm not. - Tanya, can we get the check? - No Tanya, I want the mousse. - Why you doin' this? - 'Cause I want the mousse, Aaron. - No, you're trying to be a hot shot and get all the attention. - Don't, okay, don't treat me like a child. - Stop acting like an idiot. - Fuck you! - Fuck you, we're leaving. - Eh ew uh ho-o-o-ooh. - Ho uh-ho ho ho uh-ho ho. - So, you want it or not? - Yes, Tanya, give me some of that gee-dang mousse, please. And in fact, round of mousse for everyone, on me! Ho ho, man! This guy knows what I'm freaking talking about! - Huh, damn right. - You get some mousse, and you get some mousse, and you get some mousse! Mm some of that sweet sweet mousse for everybody, yeah! Oh that's liberating! - Oh my God. - Lotion company Cremes by Coo is facing a class action lawsuit. You may recognize their latest ad played on television. - Mm, it's gonna be so good. We're gonna eat it. - Vin. - And then we're gonna talk about it. - Vin! - What? - Uh... - Oh! - With Cremes by Coo. - Cremes by Coo is led by CEO Cooper Johnson. The class action lawsuit examines bold claims about it's companies age reversing miracle product. Sara Telson alerted the FDA after her grandmother suffered skin burns and severe hallucinations. - Dude. - Mister Johnson continues to deny allegations. Court proceedings are expected to begin next week. - No, no refunds. Come on, Andy, move it! - We'll now send it over to Hurt Dribble for traffic. - Oh shit, shit! We gotta get back to the city, man. This is bad. - Ah, screw him, he's a corporate pig. - Hey. Cooper's the only one left with any money to fix this. If he gets locked up, we're fucked. - Okay. - Mother fuckers. - Well, there goes our security deposit. - Let's pull around back. - Damn it, Cooper. - Cooper! Coop, where's the money? Hey, hey, where's the money? - It's gone. Yep, it was all for show. I spent it all on the God damn creme. Oh, Angela zucked me, she zucked me good. And now we're more fucked than we were before. Who wants to help me bar the doors? - What, from who? Who are these people, Cooper? Why is there an angry mob outside our house? What did you do? - It wasn't me, all right. It was the creme, it's poison, it's making my customers delusional. And would you please help me bar the doors? They followed you to the back? - I locked it, it's fine. - Ah! - Shit! Grab a weapon! Oh, battle stations! - Maybe we can reason with them. - Oh shit! - Ah! Oh, oh. - Oh! Oh, I can feel his brain. I can feel his brain. Oh. - Aaron, check the front! - They found me. - The coast is clear, let's make a run for it! - Sorry, Aaron. - OJ, let's talk about this. Hey, it was a, it's a mix up. It was an accident. - I gotta, it's just what I do. - No! - You guys! - I'm alive, oh, I'm alive, guh. - Who the fuck was that kid? - That's my son, 22. He's a real American hero. He must've stowed away back at the farm and escaped with his dad to the city. My son saved us. - Dude, what did they do to you on that farm? That's all bullshit. - I think I hear the cops. We should get going. - Oh shit, someone give me a hand getting up. - Here you go. - Who's hand is that. - Investigators in Chicago have ended their search for Aaron Fronk, Cooper Johnson, and Vincent DeGaetano. They were last seen four months ago in their apartment before it was engulfed in flames from an explosion and are presumed to be dead. - Do you see this story? Some young punks probably all doped up on drugs, stole a bunch of money, then blew themselves to high hell. - Kids these days, always high. - Yep, that's why always come prepared. - Fuckin' A. - Gun in bar, great idea. - Fuckin' bad ass, right? Fuck those fuckin' kids, man. - Yo, man, the disguises work. - What disguises? My name is Brian King, and I work at the laundromat down the street. - That's good, that's really good. - Thanks, man. - Sorry, the ladies room was full. Okay, so I think I got it. My name is Vivienne St Claire, widower of a steel tycoon, who works part time at Chipotle. - Oh, that's good. - Wow, you guys have, like, character back stories. Like, I don't have any of that. - Well what do you got? - Uh... Okay yeah, um... I'm Schmidt. - Schmidt what? - I-I don't, that's all, that's as far as I've gotten. - Okay. - Okay, it's a start. You gotta start somewhere. You got your whole life to figure it out. You'll get it. - Hi folks, what'll it be? - Tots and some ribs. - I'll have a bowl of lettuce and a steak. - Heck with it, I'm gonna do four pot pies and a gravy boat please. - I'll get that ready for you right now. - Thank you, sweetheart. - I gotta see something! I don't care if they're dead. I mean, I gave 'em 1000 bucks, come on. - I can't believe we're dead. This really sucks. - Yeah, it's kinda like we're in this weird purgatory thing, right. But in Tulsa. - Man, we are idiots. I mean, really, we're idiots. We had $75,000. We should've just made a movie, right? Instead we just blew it on stupid shit. And now look at us, we look like dumb asses. We had the money, we could've just made a movie. Something that people would’ve sat down and watched with their friends and family, and then criticized later on the internet. Right? I mean we could've made something. - I don't know, man, that's like a lot of work. - Yeah, movies are hard. - Are you fucking kidding me! - Fuck you guys. - You're a disgrace to the city of Chicago. - Where the fuck is it? Where the fuck's the movie? - They basically aren't doing the film and can't refund any of us. - We got scammed by FND. - They stole my fucking money! - Two years, no updates. - Then you went and fucking lied to me! - I have to sue you. - Where'd you go, FND? - Did you just take my money and leave with it? - $75,000. - You can't even fucking give it back? - You're fuckin' dead to me. - Very pissed off. - Fuck you, Cooper. - Fuck these guys. - I hope you all choke on my money. - I want my fucking money back, Aaron. - You stupid little jerk offs. - I hope it was worth it. - You're dead to me, FND, that's how it goes. - How could you do this to us, to us? - 'Cause I was a big supporter of you guys. - I followed you guys for almost ten years. - I'm very, very, disappointed in you guys. - So y'all better give me back my God damn money or somethin'. - I got some legs to break, okay. I'll see you guys next time.
