Tangina. Over here! I think we finally found the core. We dug under the swimming pool. This is directly below the old graveyard. There's a presence. (WATER RIPPLING) TANGINA: There's something terrible. Too much power. I've seen it in dreams. What is it? Where's the family now? ROBBIE: Did you make that? GRAMMA JESS: It's like an inch and a half. Let me try this up against her arm. Oh, Mother, it's too hot on the kids. CAROL ANNE: Oh, Dad. STEVEN: Okay. Ready. (STEVEN LAUGHING) (E. BUZZ BARKING) (ALL CHATTERING) GRAMMA JESS: You'll be lucky if your teeth don't fall out from that. (ALL LAUGHING) Did you think up that sandwich all by yourself? No. Gramma helped. What a fib! Grab me the red yarn out of my basket, will you, honey? (E. BUZZ BARKS) DIANE: (LAUGHING) E. Buzz, stop! CAROL ANNE: That's disgusting. DIANE: Oh, Rob! ROBBIE: E. Buzz. DIANE: E. Buzz, down! (E. BUZZ BARKING) Well, maybe E. Buzz would like some mustard. STEVEN: E. Buzz, get down. Down, E. Buzz. I'll say "down," and then he'll get down. Down! (E. BUZZ BARKING) He really listens to you. Honey, now could you get me the yellow yarn? DIANE: Oh, Rob, very nice to share with E. Buzz. STEVEN: E. Buzz knows how to share with Robbie. ROBBIE: E. Buzz, get down. Thank you, angel. Come on, Guerrero! Hit it out of the park! Yeah, hit it! MAN ON RADIO: Guerrero has fired a right and struck out... (STATIC) Dad, can't we get a TV like everybody else? No, no, we can't get a TV. Great, I'll just have to grow up retarded. Come on, Rob, kids don't grow up retardo because of lack of television. Guerrero drives one to left center field... Atta boy, Guerrero! Did you see that, Robbie? No, Dad. I didn't see it. Well, you gotta use your imagination, son. Come on. We're gonna test this baby out. God! (WHIRRING) How am I gonna sell this to innocent housewives, Robbie? I don't know, Dad. Whatcha drawing, honey? Don't know. Stuff. You draw very well. Do you want to be an artist when you grow up? Maybe. Don't want to grow up much. How come? Probably not much fun. Oh, sure it is. I've loved every age I've been. They all have their blessings. When I was your age, I learned that I could do things that other folks couldn't. Like what kind of things? I just knew things. I didn't know how I knew, but I did. Like what? Once, my mother lost her bracelet and I knew where it was. Two miles from our house in a place that I'd never been. Now, do you ever know things and can't explain why? Yes? Yes. Well, darling, that's a very special gift that you and I have. It's nothing to be scared of. Will it help me be a ballerina? Yes, sure it will. Whatever you dream, you can be. DIANE: They denied our claim again! STEVEN: What? I told you, we never should have told them that the house vanished into thin air. That's exactly what I've been talking about. You tell the truth, and what do you get? Nada! They say that if the house disappeared, then technically, it's only missing. Missing? What do they think, this house is going to return or something? Now, it's been a full year. The house is not coming back. I got a gut feeling, Diane, I'm positive about that. I know that, Steven. You tell them that... No, no, I'm gonna fill out the fourth claim. Okay, what are we going to claim this time? Act of God? Housenapping? Steven, we are almost broke. Okay, we're broke, but we're not starving. Okay, but I don't happen to like having to live off my mother. And I think that we deserve a house of our own again someday. Oh, honey, gee, gosh. See, that's the difference between you and me, Diane, I am into downward mobility. I'm not settled for it, I'm into it. I like getting out there in the streets and meeting those. . . I like selling vacuums. I like carrying the pipes and the apparatus in my little demo case. Let's get the kids up, and we'll paint the car different colors, kind of DayGlo, like we used to do when we were kinda freaky, you know? The freaky Freelings on the road again! You know, the family whose house disappeared! Watch them find it, Diane. I'm not going to get upset about this, but I'll tell you something, I'm writing them back and when I sign that letter I'm signing "Mr. President." DIANE: (LAUGHING) You are wacko! Steven. Hmm. Steven. Hmm? (STEVEN SNIFFLING) Steven, you were never a hippie. Huh? You were never a hippie. You were always into making money. The only reason you painted your van DayGlo colors and grew your hair long was to impress Cookie Gurnich. Cookie? Necki necka wow! Steven, don't tell me what Cookie can do. I hated you then. But I always knew how to make up to you? Didn't I? No, I don't remember. - Sure you do. - I do not! Oh, come on. I don't. Oh, you'd sing that stupid song.

Well, he's not used to having other pets around. Robert! How would you like it if I brought home a new baby? That's even better than a kitten. Mom, I have a great idea. No, we are not buying a television set, Robert. ROBBIE: Mom, a present for Dad. It's a bargain. Mom! Mom, where are you? Mom! Mom! Mom! Robbie! Mom! Robbie! Hi. Are you lost, sweetheart?

Waitress, check! (IN GRAMMA JESS'S VOICE) Listen, children, you can't run from this thing. It has made contact and will stop at nothing. You've got to fight it head on. Stay together. Be loving.

STEVEN: What do you want? She told you the truth. DIANE: Who? (STAMMERING) You mean that... Ah, man, are you in cahoots with the lady in there? I cahoot with no one. Then why are you following us? I came to help. Oh, God. I mean, you don't understand. See, we don't want your help. We don't want anybody's help. We want to be left alone! Steven, wait. Why did Tangina send you? Why didn't she come herself? It's my kind of job. You know, maybe it's no coincidence. This guy shows up, things go kinda screwy. Get off my car! Get in the car, Diane. Get in the car, kids. Diane, get in the car. Steven, wait a minute. Steven, let's listen to the man. Fine, you listen to him. I wanna go home. Listen, let's be sensible about this. Sensible? What is sensible, honey? Nobody can help us. Now, let's just get in the car and get the hell out of here! And go where? It followed us here. It'll follow us wherever we go. We can't just keep running.

I've read about these rain dances. I know. DIANE: I understand, Tangina. We don't need rain. DIANE: I can't say that Steven fully trusts him yet. Well, you can't blame him, I mean... Yeah, okay. Well, thanks, Tangina. We will. Bye. Honey, she says he's okay. I think we should give him a chance. Tangina says he's okay? Yeah. Oh, that's great. Keep an open mind, Steven. (SIGHS) Diane, I mean, really. This is bizarre. You know, look, I've got nothing against these people. You know, I mean, I read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. I got through most of the chapters. I got some Indian in me, I think. A sixteenth, my mother will never admit to it. But honey, I mean, what if this guy is, like, an escapee from the tribal asylum? ROBBIE: Mom, come look at this!

Hey, I'm a big guy now. And I'm still your mother. Go in the house and wait for me. Thanks, Mom. He wants to be a man. Well, there are a lot of ways to be a man. I'm not sure wearing claw marks and war paint is one of them. How would you know? What? You're not a man, are you? Okay, I'm not a man. But you're not a mother! It is my job to do everything I can to make my children part of a normal world. A world of school, and friends, and lovers, and families of their own, someday. Well, that's good. Right, I know. And I hope that they'll learn to forget all this soon. They cannot learn by forgetting. Well, what would you have me do, I mean, they're just children, for God's sake. Children have fought wars. They've built nations. They are strong and have courage. Don't treat them any less than that because they're young. (TIRES SCREECHING) (ENGINE BACKFIRING) (STEVEN SCREAMS) STEVEN: Taylor! Taylor!

I don't think that's true. They've been doing something to you against your will. And by now, you're feeling helpless, like a leaf in the wind. Taylor, it would help me out a lot if you'd just say what's on your mind so I could understand you. You understand me. No matter how much you like to feel sorry for yourself, you have to change that.

I'm not sure, but he's used to getting what he wants. Taylor. Who is he? What is he? He's a man filled with a demon, lost in a dimension that surrounds our world. This entity believes that his world and ours are the same. Why doesn't he know he's dead? Because he isn't. How can that be? Nothing really dies. Like a caterpillar becomes a butterfly, death only transforms us into another state of being. This man was evil and his soul remains evil because he chooses not to see the light and pass on to a different consciousness. How are we going to fight this thing? Until we learn how to defeat him, we do not let him win. That's a hell of a plan. That's a lot of crap. I suppose you have a plan of your own. That's a lot of crap! Shh. Listen. Don't come apart now. TAYLOR: This spirit is very clever. He knows your strength is your love, and he hates you for that. He's been trying to pull this family apart, and he will continue to try. If he succeeds, he will possess Carol Anne and destroy your spirit. (EAGLE SCREECHES) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (GASPS) (KNOCKING CONTINUES) (KNOCKING) (GASPING) Hi ! Tangina! Hi, Diane.

TANGINA: Mmm-hmm, below the old cemetery, what seems to be a tomb with many bodies in it, directly below your house. Who are they? The researchers don't know who these people were. There are no marked graves. There are, however, records of a religious sect that mysteriously disappeared. What happened? Their spiritual leader was a medium who led his followers out to California in the early 1800s to start a utopian society. They disappeared near Cuesta Verde and were believed massacred by Indians. This could be them. (WHISPERING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE) (SNICKERING) This funny? Well, no, uh... I love the health club, you know. I'm just wondering when I get the key to my locker?

Who is he? I've consulted others. They've told me things, but they said you know more! I don't know anything! Yes, you do! You traveled to a dimension few people have ever traveled to incarnate! Your daughter is highly clairvoyant! As was your mother, I suspect. As you are as well! Now tell me what you feel! It is him. It's the preacher. They're following him in death like they did in life. DIANE: They seal themselves in the cavern, because Kane tells them the end of the world is coming. Come with me! DIANE: The day he predicts for the end comes and goes, but Kane won't let them leave! Don't! No, please! Please don't! Please don't! (SOBBING) Please... TANGINA: Oh, Diane. Yes, it all makes sense now.
