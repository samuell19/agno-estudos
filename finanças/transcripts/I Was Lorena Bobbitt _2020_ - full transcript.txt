I think, I-I think I hurt him. - Lorena, what did you do? - You might remember me from the news. Reporter: Satellite dishes sprouted like weeds outside the county courthouse in Manassas Virginia. Reporter 2: This is a classic tabloid story, it's got sex and blood. Lorena: Back then, people laugh at me, made cruel jokes. They didn't want to hear about the truth, about the abuse I suffered. Man: Everybody argues, but to cut a man's penis off for it? There's no sense in that. - You might know my name, but you don't know my story. I came to live in America when I was 18. To me, this was the best country in the world. I wanted the American Dream. Today, I use my maiden name, Lorena Gallo. But back then, I went by a different one. Back then, I was Lorena Bobbitt. To understand the truth of what really happened, we need to go back to the night when I first met John Wayne Bobbitt. (Indistinct bar chatter) - I'm right here! - Excuse me? - Well, you're clearly looking for me. The most handsome guy in the place. - (Laughs) Uh, no. My friend, Yvonne, she's out there. - Okay.

But I just got back from a tour in Okinawa. - You were in the American Army in Japan? - I'm a marine. - What was Japan like? - It was beautiful. Lot of history, food was amazing, people real friendly. - That's so wonderful. I... I only been to the U.S., but I want to travel everywhere and see so many countries. - Stick with me, you might just get your wish. (Small laugh) What about you? What are you doing in Virginia? - I go to school, and I'm a nanny for a nice lady, Miss Janna. - (Laughing) - You laugh at me. I know, I know, my English is so bad. - No, I'm... I'm just looking at how beautiful you are. How come you don't have a boyfriend? Well, looks like we'll have to change that. (Chuckles) (Phone rings) - Hola? - Good morning, this is Corporal John Bobbitt. May I please speak to Lorena? - She said you might call. If you want to see her, you need to come to the house so I can meet you. John: You mean, like an interview? - Lorena lives under my roof. She cannot date anyone without my permission. Those are the rules. - Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. (Speaking Spanish) Lorena: He's a soldier I met last night. He's really cute, and he's so nice to me. - You've only been here a couple months. You don't waste any time. - Oh, it's not like that. He just ask me to dance, and then we talk... I think I like him. - Only fools rush in, Lorena. But if he doesn't have three eyes and a hump on his back, I'll let you go out with him. - Oh, thank you, Mrs. Castro! - But only, and always, chaperoned. - (Sighs) He'll think I'm a child. - Then he's not worth you. Your mother would kill me if I didn't look after you. - (Sighs) (Door opens and shuts) - (Chuckles lightly) I hired you to be my son's nanny, not a maid. - Can I ask you a question? Ah. You have this big, beautiful house, a nice car, you own two nail salons-- - About to have three. - And you do it all alone, no husband. It's very impressive. I want to know, how do you get that? - A helluva lotta hard work. The new store in Centerville opens next week! - You know I'm very grateful for this job, and... and Kyle, he's such a good boy, but... I think-- - You want more. - Do you think I could ever work at your nail store? - What about Kyle? - Oh, I can do both. I can work at the nail store while Kyle is at school, and then I can come home and stay with him until you get back home. - You know, I think you could, too. I'd be happy to train you. - (Excited laugh) Thank you. - (Chuckles) - Um, I had a really nice time. - How many times have I told you, John? No kissing. - Uh, jeez, Mrs. C, we've been seeing each other for a month now. You didn't say I can't kiss you though! - Such a bad boy. What's he doing with a bike? - He rode it in from Quantico. - In this weather? That's 20 miles away! - Uh, 25, actually. But I would ride twice that far just to see my princess. - (Chuckles) - I'll see you next week. (Pool balls clack) Mercedes: So... you and John are getting kinda serious, huh? - I guess so. It's been eight months. - I don't get what you see in him. - You don't like John? - He kinda drinks a lot. And he always "happens" to forget his wallet whenever we go out. - John's a good guy. Why can't you be happy for me? - Hey, Warden, could I have a minute with my girl? - I asked you not to call me that. I'm gonna go get some fries. - All right, grab me a beer. Pfft! She keeps eating like that, she'll never find a boyfriend. - That's not nice, John. - Oh, what do I care? Besides, she's not nearly as hot as you... and your sexy little body. - (playful) Stop. - I uh... found something by the pool table. Do you wanna see what it is? - Mm-hmm. - Now... I know it's not much, and I know I just found it, but... here you are. - (Gasps) - Until I get a real diamond. - (Shocked laugh) Are you asking me to marry you? - It's more of a promise. I don't wanna lose you. - But I'm not going anywhere. - Yeah, but you've got this great job working at the salon and I don't want some other guy to come by and scoop you up. - I wouldn't do that. I'm happy with you. - And I wanna keep it that way. I want you, Lorena, all to myself. I love you. - I love you, too. (Giggles happily) Lorena: I built fantasies of us spending our lives together, living around the world, making a family. I was 19, I've never dated anyone, and John was my first love. I do. - Do you love me? - (Chuckles) Forever and ever. (Giggles happily) - Is that a new blouse? Did you go shopping without me? - I got it from the PX at Quantico. Now that I'm married, I get base privileges. Oh, and there's an amazing grocery store, and gas is half the price there. I just feel so blessed with everything that's happened. - You know, if John's got any buddies that you want to set me up with then, I wouldn't mind having your life, either. - Maybe you would like Todd. - Who's that? And is he as hot as John? - (Laughs) No one is as handsome as John. And Todd is his cousin. He came from New York, he's staying with us for awhile. - I mean, you've only been married a couple of weeks and somebody's already living with you? That seems kinda messed up. - They grew up together. John says they're like brothers. - Still, so what? Your place is tiny! And, I mean, that's gotta cramp your... your "newlywed" activities. - We find... time. Besides, family is very important to the both of us. And John says it'll only be for a couple of weeks. - Well, John says a lot of things. What do you say? - Maybe we'll go on a double date? - (Chuckles) (Door clicks open) - Hey, baby. What's got you so excited? - A surprise! I made reservations for us at Blackbird's tonight for dinner. - That fancy place in DC? - Mm-hmm. - I can't afford that. - I can! I got my first paycheck today. - Okay. Uh, yeah, I guess. But that, that place is so stuffy. Let's just go to Chelsea's. - But I want to celebrate... some place special. - Hey, Chelsea's has wings. Oh, you love wings! Please? You wanna make me happy, don't you? - (Giggles) (Toilet flushes) - Hey! Grab your jacket, cous, we're headed to Chelsea's. Lorena's treat. Todd: (Laughs) - Isn't she the best? - Awesome, dude. Thanks! - John. John. - What? - I thought it was just supposed to be the two of us. - Don't be rude, babe. Look... if one of your family was staying with us, we'd include them. (Door opens) - Chelsea's. (Rock music plays, people chatter) (Shot glasses thunk) - John, come on, let's go. - We just got more shots. (Glasses clink) - I'm hungry, and this is no fun. - I dunno, Todd and I are having a blast. - Two. - Okay, fine. You two stay and take a cab home. I'm leaving. - Oh yeah? (Keys clink) - John, you're too drunk. Give me the keys. (Keys jingle) - (Laughs) I drive tanks for a living. I got this.

I didn't even hit you that hard. - (Crying) (Crying) - I told you to stop crying! (Hard slap) - Ahhhh! Ahhhh! (Thumps on floor) - Ungh-- (Loud knock) The door is open, Todd!

Why? - Sir, have you been drinking? - Uh, a few beers, but I'm okay. - I was passing by and saw a scuffle through the window. - Oh, we, uh, we just moved in. We haven't had a time to put up um... the... (laughs) put up the curtains yet. - Okay. What about the fight? - Oh! Oh... It's not like that. She gets paranoid sometimes, and I... I just have to calm her down. Right, baby? - Ma'am, are you okay? Do you wanna stay here? You have someone who you can stay with? - (Shaky) But I want to leave anyway. - You betcha. Come on.

(Crying) And then there was so much blood. - Yeah, we're aware of the incident, ma'am. But, uh, what I need to know now is, is... where it is. The appendage - what did you do with it? - What about what that bastard did to her to make her do this? - This woman's husband is here in this hospital and he's in critical condition. - (Panicked) John's here? Please, please, don't let him find me. - No, ma'am, I don't think that's possible. He's in pretty bad shape. What we need to do now is to locate... "it" to see if they can sew it back on. - (Crying) I threw it out the car window... on Old C-C-Centreville Road, n-near a convenience store. - Send them out. Do a grid search on Old Centreville, around the convenience store. Okay, so a, a nurse is gonna come in and, uh, administer a PERK exam. Do you know what that is? - It's a rape kit, honey. They're gonna collect evidence so they can prove what John did to you. - All right, ya'll sit tight. The nurse'll be right in. - Can I go home after that? - We're a long way from that. Lorena: A lot of what happened the first night was a blur, but I do remember being terrified. I have no idea that what I've done will change my life forever. (Crying) John came in the bedroom and he took off his clothes and... but he kept his underwears on. - He... he kept them on? Um... (pages flip) Yeah. You said earlier he took them off. - Okay, maybe he took them off. - So which one is it, Mrs. Bobbitt? Did he keep them on or take it off? - He kept them on. - Are we gonna be here much longer? She's been at this all night. She hasn't slept-- - Just a couple more questions. You said earlier you tried to scream. - Yes. - And uh... your husband's friend, Robbie - is that his name? - (Crying) Robbie Johnston. He came to stay with us from New York. He and John went out drinking. - So... Robbie's sleeping on a couch in the living room, and he doesn't hear anything? - (Crying) The bedroom door was closed. - Still, I'm sure he could've easily heard you if, indeed, you did yell. - Are you insinuating that she didn't? - This is an official police interview. So, I'm gonna tell you one last time to please refrain from talking. Lorena: I was interrogated for more than 14 hours, kept awake all night. I didn't understand what was happening and my English then, it wasn't so good. I was never offered a translator or an attorney to help me to navigate through the answers or questions. (Crying) I told him that... he shouldn't do this to me. - And? Did he reply? - (Crying) He said he doesn't care about my feelings. (Sniffling and crying) I ask him... if he has orgasm inside of me because it hurt me when he made me do that. He always... have orgasm and he doesn't wait for me to have orgasm. He's selfish, and I don't think it's fair. So I... I-I-I pulled, I pulled back the sheets and did... and then... I did it. (Sobbing) I couldn't even understand how to put the word "rape". I... that did not exist in my vocabulary. And, uh, I, I might say things that it wouldn't help through my case and I was basically incriminating myself.

The District Attorney's office has decided that John should only be charged with "marital sexual assault." - But he raped me. - Well, Virginia law states that the charge of rape can only be applied to couples who aren't living together at the time of the incident or when there is serious physical injury to the victim, which is you. Neither of those elements apply here. - So, the law says that... my husband can rape me... as long as he doesn't beat me up? - Unfortunately, yes, uh, that's how the statute's currently written. - How is that fair? He was abusing me. I was just... protecting myself. - And we're gonna hammer that really hard at your trial. Lorena, right now, we need to pay attention to John's case. The evidence they lay out, how they-they spin his side of the story... - What happens if they say I'm guilty? - You have to understand that this charge of malicious wounding is a serious one. If you stand trial and are found guilty, you could be looking at... 20 years in prison. - (Shocked gasp) I thought I was the only woman, perhaps in the world, that was going through this type of abuse and, uh, I was ashamed. It's like living with a stranger that you don't know how bad he's gonna react. (Music plays on TV) It's 3 am, John.

Ungh! - (Groans) - No! No! John, please! I don't want this! (Crying) John, please! - Oh, it's so much more fun this way. - (Sobbing) No, not for me! (Screaming in pain) (Screaming and crying) Lorena: If I can describe um... the um... psychological and emotional abuse that I endure at the hands of my abuser, I felt like a hostage in my own house. I thought he would stop, that I could make it better, but he just keep doing it. And now he took my temporary green card and my papers with him. - Where did he go? - Back to New York. He said that immigration is gonna come and throw me out of my country. - No. No, they won't. Lorena: John constantly threatened me with deportation even though my visa status had nothing to do with him. He basically used my visa status as another weapon to control me. (Polaroid camera whirs) - I'm gonna send these to the INS. - What good will that do? - You can seek asylum as an abused spouse, get your permanent green card. - John says they won't believe me. - With these, how can they not? Lorena: Mercedes sent those photos to INS, but they never responded. (Clapping and cheering) John's trial was first. Mine was second. (Supporters cheer and clap) Supporter: You got this, John. Bailiff: Will the defendant please rise? Judge: In the case of the People of Virginia versus John Wayne Bobbitt, the jury finds the defendant... not guilty... (Courtroom cheers) of marital sexual assault. (Gavel bangs) The defendant is free to go. (Low hum of chatter) Juror: The jury was persuaded by Mr. Bobbitt's lawyer that the case was too circumstantial. We couldn't rely on Mrs. Bobbitt's word alone. If someone had heard her scream or there'd been some sort of bruising, that'd be more substantive evidence. - The law said that evidence from previous abuse was inadmissible. That still upsets me to this day. - Get lost! Would you creeps get a life?! (Door slams) News Reporter: In the city of Manassas, Virginia, where John Bobbitt was found not guilty of sexually assaulting his wife. Lorena now faces a charge of malicious wounding and could get up to 20 years. The Washington Post reported Friday that-- (TV clicks off) - (Shaky inhale) It doesn't make any sense. He admit he hit me. How can the jury take his side? - It's such bullshit. Sweetie, you gotta eat something. - I can't. (Sniffling) All the press out there, honking their horns, banging on the door. I can't sleep. (Crying) I'm having nightmares. - Don't let them win. Your trial starts in a month. You need to stay healthy so that you can fight back and, and prove your innocence. - Oh my God... (shaky breath) if they took his side, they're not going to believe me. Am I going to go to prison? - (Sighs) Howard: I'm not gonna lie to you, John's acquittal is a blow to our case. We need to tweak our strategy a little bit, so I've added Ms. Kemler to our team. I need you to listen, and I need you to keep an open mind. We'd like to introduce Battered Women Syndrome as part of your defense. Kemler: Now, you should know it's risky. It's only been used in court a couple times as a viable defense. - If you think it'll help, then yes. - In addition, we'd like to plead irresistible impulse. - What does that mean? - Well, we would argue that you, the defendant, couldn't control your actions as a result of a mental disorder. It's a type of insanity plea. - But I'm not crazy. - Here, here's the deal, Lorena. I'm-I'm not blaming you at all, nor am I judging you for what you did. But you already said you did it, you confessed to the police. - If I do something, I take responsibility for it. - So, given that, we need to argue why you did it. - Lorena, we need to put you up on the stand so that you can tell everyone what John did to you. - You want me to... say this out loud in front of everyone... in a courtroom? I can't do that. I'm going out with friends tonight after work, Mrs. Castro, okay? Uh, don't wait up, and don't worry! Mrs. Castro: Be safe, dear. - Okay. (Doorbell rings) Oh, I'll get it! (Gasps) - Hey, you... - What're you doing here? - I just drove all night from New York. Uh, I wanted to catch you before you went to work. - I haven't seen or heard from you in over a year. I don't want to talk to you now. - Then don't, just... just listen. Please? (Door clicks shut) - Uh... I've had a lot of time to think about... what's important since I've been gone. I got counselling, uh, from Father McMahon, and I talked to some older married couples and... they said that I should admit my faults, uh, beg you for forgiveness, and uh... and hope and pray that you... might uh... uh, give me another chance. - I can't just magically erase everything you did and said to me. - Oh, I'm not asking you to. All I want is for another chance to make you happy. I-I know I can do that. - If we try again, you have to promise not to hurt me. - Promise. I'm gonna stop drinking, and I am committed to working on our marriage. - Swear to me that, as my husband, you won't hurt me. - On my honor as a Marine. Lorena: People ask why I went back with him. It's difficult to explain who and what I was back then. I was 22-years-old, a Catholic, a virgin before I met him. I believed so much in marriage. When he came back, I thought, "What if he has changed?" (John chats with neighbour) Didn't I owe it to our marriage to find out? John: Looks him dead in the eye... Lorena: Of course, now I know that's part of the cycle of abuse. Hoping it'll get better, when really, we know it won't. - (Laughing) - Robbie. - Hi. - Nice to see you again. - I told John I wouldn't get in the way. - I'll make up the couch. It's not very comfortable, but it should do for a couple of weeks. John can you go grab the extra pair of sheets, please? - Uh, we were just going to the hardware store to get some plywood. - What for? - Uh, building a partition, so Robbie can have his own room. - I thought you said it was just for a couple weeks. - Dude, you said it was cool that I could live with you guys. - What happened to working on our marriage? - We're doing that, baby! - With Robbie here? - I-I don't have money for my own place, man. - Yeah, don't worry about it. Lorena's just being bitchy. - Dude. Seriously? Uncool. - You happy now? You made him leave. - Is he going to pay the rent? Buy food? Pay the electric-- - It just doesn't stop with you, does it?! Just nag, nag, nag! At least Robbie can leave. - So can I. - Where do you think you're going? - Away from you. It's been six months since you came back. You don't have a job, you flirt with other girls right under my nose, you started drinking again, and you'd rather hang out with your friends than spend time with me in this marriage. I'm done. I want a divorce. - (Deadly calm) You're... divorcing me. - (Gasps and screams) (Suitcases thump) (Lorena screams) - I say when we're finished! Doesn't matter if we're divorced or separated. You know I can find you... and I can screw you whenever I want. You're mine, Lorena. Don't forget it. - (Gasping for breath) (Door closes) (Whimpers) - Thank you. Thank you so much for letting me come over. I didn't know who else to talk to. - You know I'm always here for you. Now what's going on? - It's John... - Oh... I was really hoping it would work out this time. - I know now that he'll never change. The marriage, it's over. (Crying) - Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. Do you wanna stay here? The guest room is all made up. - It doesn't matter. He knows where you live. He might try to hurt you, too. - Well, I'd like to see him try. - He watches... every move I make. Sometimes I think... he follows me. - How can I help? - I want a divorce, but... I'm so scared of him, (Crying) of what he'll do if I try to leave. I don't know what to do. - I have an idea. Lorena: Back then, there was no national hotline for me or any abused women to call. We didn't have federal funding for shelters and the Violence Against Women's Act wouldn't become law until the following year. For desperate women, like me, stuck in these situations, we were often forced to take desperate measures and protect ourselves because the system didn't. What're you doing here? - Still live here, remember? - I thought you said you were going out with Robbie tonight. - Yeah, he's waiting in the car. I forgot my wallet. Ah, shit! Ugh! I need some cash. (Zipper unzips) - What the hell is this? - It's mine, John. Don't-- (Struggling grunts, recorder rewinds) John's voice: You will be nothing without me, right?! - Why the hell are you recording me?

Kemler: Um... it's a good deal. You should consider it. - No. No. I married John because I loved him. And even though... he hurt me, over and over again, I thought he could change. But he didn't. Then, he went to court and he lied. (Deep breath) Now it's my turn. Now I get to tell the judge what really happened. What that monster did to me. - Starting Monday, this usually quiet courthouse will become the center of an international media circus. So, get ready for another round of Bobbitt mania. Prosecutor: This is a case about anger, about revenge, about retribution. Mrs. Bobbitt's husband came home, he was drunk, he wanted to have sex and she didn't, and that is her right. So, he forced her to have sex and she was angry, and she retaliated against him. But, you know, folks, we don't live in a society that is governed by revenge. We live in a society of law. And after you've heard all of the evidence, I'm confident that you will believe that there was no justification for her taking the law into her own hands, for her maiming her husband, and you will have no choice but to find her guilty. ♪♪♪ (Files shuffle) - I don't think I can testify. John is still my husband, and he's in that room every day watching me. Sometimes, I...

We're gonna take care of him. On the night of the incident, you went out with your friend Robbie, and you had at least 5 beers, is that right? - Correct. - And you had approximately two B52s? - It wasn't approximately, it was exactly two. - Thank you for clarifying that. Did you feel any effects of the alcohol at all? - No. None whatsoever. - How would you characterize your state after drinking that night? Robbie: I was drunk. We were drunk. - Do you remember when Officer Francis stopped by your first apartment? - Yes. He just knocked on the door, asked if everything was all right and he just left. - And you were drinking very heavily on that occasion, weren't you, Mr. Bobbitt? - No. - Yeah, he'd definitely been drinking. I could smell it on his breath. - And you've already told us that you simply never hit your wife. - Right. - Tell me about your trip to Ocean City. - He was hitting her and punching her and pulling her hair. - The jury won't give anything he says credibility now. (Low hum of chatter) ♪♪♪ (Low hum of chatter) Lorena: John's trial lasted only three days. Mine was 12. As the days dragged on, all I kept thinking was, "The jury thinks I'm guilty." And because the judge let cameras into my trial, the whole world heard the most personal, intimate details of my life. I felt naked. - Did you and John ever engage in anything other than vaginal sex? - He did it, sir. I didn't. - When did it happen? - Uh... we went into the bedroom and he um... he grabbed me and... and he turned me, and uh... I was... I was... with my stomach down... and then he um...

Yes. - How frequently? - Uh... uh, e-every time that... that we would have sex, he would... he would threaten me. - Okay, Lorena. Okay. Do you have an opinion, Dr. Feister, as to whether Lorena Bobbitt was suffering from any kind of severe mental disease or disorder at the time when she cut off her husband's penis? - Yes, she suffered from post traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorder. - What, if anything, did these disorders have to do with her ability to control her impulses? - I don't believe she had any control over her actions at that time. She was already experiencing extreme distress. Her husband psychologically closed off every avenue of escape to her because he said to her that it really didn't matter if she left, he would continue to be violent toward her, to rape her, to abuse her. This created, for her, a kind of impasse. A situation that made her crazy. She became psychotic, and, at that point in time, she attacked the instrument of her torture. That is, her husband's penis. - Now, I'd like to go back to the early morning hours of June 23rd. - John and... Robbie had gone out and...
