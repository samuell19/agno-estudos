A Strange Sunday PubliParis, I'm listening. No, he isn't here. If someone asks, I'm with the Managing Director. - Fine, Mr. Brevent. PubliParis, I'm listening. Hold the line. Do you know where is Brevent? We're waiting for him for the screening. Monsieur Brevent is with you, monsieur. - With me?! - Yes, Mr. Managing Director. Gentlemen, it seems that Brevent is here. But where is he hiding? - Monsieur Brevent, I wanted to ask you... - Wait till I come out. I've no time. Oh, you're already here? We've been waiting for you for a while, Brevent. Everything should be done on time, neither earlier nor later! - But you're not on time! - Indeed. But I've work to do, kiddo. For that we have to wait? Cemeteries are packed with people, who considered themselves indispensable. You think this is funny? He who generates gloom is chasing God in vain. - Nonsense! - St. Augustine! Enough. You aren't going to start quoting the fathers of the Church! Let me remind you that we're not here to listen to your engraved scriptures, but to view your movie on the Galbar clothes. So, let's take a look! Let's! Go ahead, roll it! Here's where the title will be. It's obviously not ready yet. But, I must warn you: It's quite an unusual idea. I stayed away from the usual staples: Pick up Flick, smile with Flock, get a whiter wash with that... It isn't about soap, but about the Galbar clothes! Okay, okay, I'll turn it on. It'll be a surprise. But what's going on with these unhappy women? - They're desperate. - Why? Because of Galbar! Impossible! How so? - These are women. - So what? And Galbar only makes clothes for men. So, women are necessarily upset. They cry! Well? And you, kids, what do you think? I didn't understand too much, but I liked it. - You you, Chartier? - Nice, but quite incomprehensible. The idea is amusing, but not for the general public. It's too negative, and not hard-hitting enough. So, it's esoteric, not for a general public, negative and not hard-hitting. In short, you don't like it much... We asked you to focus on: Galbar dresses celebrities! But I found out that Galbar does NOT dress celebrities! - And have you come up with a slogan? - Yes! Does it surprise you? It leaves me speechless! - I'd say it's quite amusing, though a bit down to earth. Here goes: I have two large oxen in my shed, and two Galbar outfits in the closet! Oh, no, man, no! A slogan is based on consonants: Furniture made by Rataplan will serve you for a long time! Year after year- that's so good! With Galbar, as in art. With my Galbar - ti-na-ni, ti-na-nar! ti-na-ni, ti-na-nar? Thank you. This will help me enormously! Ti-na-ni, ti-na-nar... - He's impossible! - Sometimes he has excellent ideas! - Once a year... - Better than never. A good idea is worth its weight in gold. Brevent landed us some huge contracts. Right now he has a dry spell It happens to the best of us. Besides, this concerns only me. Bring us the film about railways. Tee-na-ni, ti-na-na... This isn't very convenient... Rhymes with ar... Well, let's see... With Galbar - costar, Illard, flambard, chauffard We could do... Connard (asshole)! I'm king of the assholes, I buy clothes at Galbar! It rhymes, but they aren't going to like it. Allar...um, hello? - Hello? - Eglantine? - Yes, monsieur. It's Brevent. I'm hungry. Bring something to my office. - What exactly? - Whatever you like. steak tartare, a small cigar, dare-dare (on the double), as in Galbar! I can always bring him a hot dog. Two. Galbar dresses czars. Too late for that... Good God, I must come up with something! Come in. To be dressed by Galbar, no need for a milliard (billion). Do you like it? - It's silly. - It's silly? What did you bring me? - I didn't really understand your order. Oh, it doesn't matter. You're nice, all the same. I just had a thought, Monsieur Brevent... A pretty girl like you can think? My lovely child, don't try to think. It's a profession that requires study. Anyway... we think less than we think. We think that we think, but we actually dream. I have an idea for a slogan: Bravo Galbar! Oh, bravo, little duckling! What a dummy... And she may be right. - Hello? - Hold the line. For you, Monsieur Brevent, Madame Armier calling. What's happening? Nothing, it's...the mustard. Madame Armier? Put her on. Shit, the sausage... Is that you, Juliette? Excuse me. I was speaking with a colleague. Hello, listen to me, Jean. It's very important! I'm using this opportunity when Caroline is in the shower. She wants to marry a trumpet player! - A trumpet player? Black? - No, he's white. More precisely, he's green. Can you believe he plays every night at the Red Elephant?! I don't see the connection. My students are here. Wait a second, and I'll go to your room. Don't hang up. - I won't. - Marie-France! - Yes, madame? Hang up as soon as I pick up in Monsieur Brevent's room. Yes, madame. - And no eavesdropping! - Oh, madame! Start rehearsing, kids. Don't wait for me. You can hang up, kid. - Okay, madame. So, she hung up. Hello, you hear me, Jean? - Hello? Ah, my sausage... - Can you hear me? Yes, I'm listening. Well...? You know Caroline, she's still a child. And not too smart. Huh? But what is it... You should definitely talk to her when you return. Oh, mom, it's disgusting to conspire when I take a shower! You cheat! I'll never bathe again! A big difference that will make! Jean, don't listen to her. She's a cheat! - Let go of this phone! - I want to talk to him! - Let me finish! - Right now! Hey, one at a time. I don't want her to marry a trumpet player! He's a wonderful guy! Mom has an anti-bourgeois bias! Me?! This is going too far! I have an anti-bourgeois bias?! Let me make it clear, Jean. At 14, I was at the Folies Bergere. At 18, at the Comedie Francaise. I traveled by camel across the Sahara with a Pasha's son. I sang in Hamburg. I have an odd resume. But when it came to marriage, I still chose a civil servant. And I will marry a trumpet player! - Good for you, Caroline! - Are you insane?! But I do have an opinion about Caroline's situation... - Good evening, Brevent. Sorry, boss. Stop all arguments until I return. It's an order! Am I or am I not Caoline's spiritual father? Okay, Jean. This Madame Armier, my landlady. Madame Armier, the actress? - Yes. Hello, Monsieur Brevent. - Hello, mademoiselle. I rent a room from her. - When will you get an apartment? Me? Never, boss. At Madame Armier's it's lively, fun. It gets really boring when I'm all by myself. Please wait for me outside for a moment. I need to solve an urgent problem. Between the two of us, what are you still doing here? - I toil, boss. - I see. Right now, as you can see, I'm all tied up. When you act like a clown, it means something's wrong. I've known you for too long. Well, what is it, Jean? If all the men ditched by their wives would lose control, 90 percent of all businesses would go bankrupt. Yes, your wife talks, but Galbar remains! Don't be a fool, man! Is that an order, my colonel? I'm no longer your colonel, but I remain your friend. Yes, I admit, I still love my wife. Catherine... She was an angel, you know? You annoy me with your Catherine. Snap out of it! Find yourself a beautiful girl and we won't talk about it anymore. But I never talk about it! You think about it all the time, and it solves nothing! See what I'm saying? - Say nothing more, Colonel, and let me work. - Enough work for today. Come on. We're closing. It's late. It's never too late to say "Galbar"! Okay, let's go. - All the same, you have a good car. - How nice. - And it works? - With gas, yes. Well, I like mine... I'm waiting for the young one, who went to get the papers. Goodbye, pal. - Goodbye, boss. Catherine! Catherine... Let me through! - I have priority! - Priority? What's that? - I'm a deputy! - Have you no shame?! A book of tickets. - Shall I tear off your ticket? - Keep the change. - It's you? - Yes, me. Why? Do I appear to be someone else? Not at all. I thought you were in Patagonia. I was in New York. In any case, you were very far away. - It's been long time?. - 5 years. It's been exactly 5 years the day before yesterday. How are you? Without you. And you? Alright. I travel a lot. Hotels, always hotels... I'm here for 3 days. On Sunday evening I'm leaving for Canada. The Great North, polar dogs, sleds... You're being silly... You're so beautiful... Thank you. You take the bus? Yes, not cabs. And you? So do I. You can never get one at this hour. You no longer have your Traction? No. Sold it. - You have another one? Yes, but it's in the garage. For repairs. - Traction Cit? - No. A monstrosity. An American car. It looks like an aircraft carrier. You're lucky. Not really. That isn't luck, Catherine. Excuse me, madame. - Goodbye, Jean. - Do we part like that? It's necessary. Bye. - Bye. Can I help you, monsieur? A lady has just come in a moment ago, wearing a small hat. - Yes, indeed. You don't know where she went? She didn't ask anything. There are more than 300 offices in this building. Thank you... Thank you, monsieur. - Monsieur. Hello. - Hello, Colonel. - Captain. - Excuse me, Captain. - Water, please. - I'll give you a glass. - No, no, it's not me. It's for the Jeep. The poor thing is overheated. - I could give you a jug. - Great! Okay. Pleased to see me? Yes, of course. - Me too, of course. - All the better. Thanks on her behalf. She'll never forget you. Oh, no luck! Oh, do you think I'm clumsy? I'll have to ask for water again. It's annoying... - I'll get it for you. - Great. Hey, you bunch of lazy bums! You couldn't find water? Can't you see the Jeep is smoking? Get off! We rely on you, captain. As usual. No initiative whatsoever. I have to take care of everything myself. What's wrong? No, I...everything hurts. It started in Chad, continued in the Sahara, in Italy... And now we're in Nantes. But it still hasn't stopped. - Are you wounded? - Oh, yeah...here... - Where? - Here, here, and here... But it's already healed. Would you like an aspirin? I don't have anything else here. Do you have any alcohol? No, but I have Calvados. That'll be perfect. - How much do I owe you? - Nothing, of course. Then let's have a toast. Let's. You're very beautiful. That's kind of you. I owe you my life. Only a Calvados. We say crazy things. Maybe it's love at first sight? Or maybe it's simply the victory. We have to be clear about that. See you tonight. - Here? - Yes. At 8:00. - You'll come? - Yeah. - And what if we're wrong? - You can't be wrong on Victory Day. This only happens once every 30 years. Your battalion is waiting for you. - It's a company. - Sorry. It makes no difference. I feel much better. Me too. You're not well either? Oh, nothing serious. - A matter of the heart? - Yes, maybe that's it. It hurts everywhere and nowhere. I'm familiar with this. Were you unhappy? A little, a lot... Like everybody else. I'm familiar with this. Hey, Captain, we're waiting for you! - Hey, Captain! - Shut up, you all! I'd like to give you something. A souvenir, jewelry... - You're crazy... Here you go... See you tonight. I'll return it to you. If you behave, you can keep it. I'll behave. Let's go! - What's the matter? - It's about a wedding. Monsieur, we see each other every day for a whole month since your discharge. About 8 hours a day. You're so jealous that you made the customers leave. It's now half past midnight, and the store is closed. But I have urgent business, mademoiselle. The pharmacist on duty is at 3, Place du Marche. - Sorry? - Place du Marche. But it's an urgent emergency. So, is it yes? - You're unbearable. But this is not an answer! So? Be reasonable, go to sleep. I haven't slept for a month. And I won't sleep until you say yes! You're crazy! I love you, Catherine. Marry me. - We are not set up for this. - But I'll get a job. I warn you, I'll never be Boussac (created Dior). Why not? I'm not good at that. And there's already one... Money means a lot for a woman, you know? A big bank account, a big car, a big house...Huh? There's nothing big or ugly in what I've said. And that means? .. That I hate mediocrity, because it kills everything. And I warn you, because I love you. I know, I'm just a poor fool. No. You're a man, and you're lucky. A man can wear whatever he wants: two suits, 6 shirts - and you're satisfied. It's different for us, women. We're fragile, very vulnerable, Jean. We need to feel beautiful. You understand? - Yes, Catherine. So, when you accept to never be rich, you scare me. Enough to not marry me? No. Then... the answer is yes? Yes! I have a collection of old phonographs. Look, Sartori, this is an Edison 1890. - You've got a good head. - And it works, look! And I have others. You know, I get them at the flea market. There are others over here. This is a Pathe 1903. A Mason 1905. This is the last Charles Cross. This is another Pathe, from 1898, I believe. And look at their precursor, The Lioret 1881. Eh? Don't worry, it won't break. - And it's still working? - It's best to not find out. If you want to listen to something good, here's a tape recorder, The last word in modern science. It's a magnetic film. - It must be very expensive. A six month loan. I made a recording of Catherine. Just listen. "The time for love always returns, like a bird in a summer sky. It comes and goes, sometimes it stays, and then suddenly flies away." I'll go to the kitchen, to get us a treat. "All lovers know well..." - Kiss me first. - No, Jean. - You don't want to? - That'll be too easy. Too easy? We kiss and pretend that all is well. But...everything IS good, Catherine. - Need any help? - No, no... - But you do.... - Leave it to me. Thanks very much. - Are we waiting for your wife? - No, no. Don't say anything. Don't cry. I'm leaving. You're leaving? I'm not even sure I won't miss you. I'm not sure of anything. Who's going with you? You're too proud to bargain. Let me go without questions. It would help me. And if I kill you? There's nothing to stop you... I love you, Catherine. Listen, Jean, I'll try to explain it to you. Yesterday I turned 30, and I felt dizzy. A woman's life is short, very short. I was scared I'd be old and ugly, without having done anything. Do you want to see Italy, You want to have a Cadillac? And now you're leaving? - Yes. But not the way you put it. I don't know if you can understand... I think I still love you. But I'm leaving you to try on a new coat. This one is 4 years old. You don't discard a man you love to change a coat! That doesn't happen. It does. You're leaving me? You're leaving me? I'm leaving you with friends that you love so much. With your precious memories, your pals. I was with this one in Montparnasse in 1924. With that one in the Sudan in 1940. I'm leaving you with them. It's Saunier. I don't care. We can't keep Colonel Saunier waiting. And if I die? You don't just die like that, Jean. - Good evening, Colonel. - Good evening, Brevent. - I'm glad I came. - I'm glad you came. Excuse me. I'm not introducing you. You know each other. - Hello, Sartori. - Good evening, Colonel. - Good evening. - Excuse me for a minute. Please don't be mad at me, but our reunion is over. Second lieutenant Robert Sartori. 3rd company. Hello. Honey, a thousand apologies, but Italian buyers are the most talkative of the world. Suzanne, no phone calls? - Everything is on your desk. Well done. Come on, dear. - Good day? - Yes. Tell me. What did you buy? - Everything. Give me a minute, and we'll go to dinner. - Listen, Robert. - Yes? I met Jean. Jean - your husband? - Yes. - Yeah. Where? On the bus. You talked? - Exchanged a few words. - nicely? Yes. A great man, your husband. I have wonderful memories of him. And then, it's natural. After 5 years, he wouldn't beat you up. Of course not. But... But what? What should I do? Nothing. It's all dead and buried. You're gone, he has a new life. You met, and you said hello. That's all. I wonder... - How's he doing? - He appears to be successful. Yes? I never would have guessed. Well, good for him. With your permission... - Listen, Robert. - Yes? He didn't know, that I left with you. No? So what? - If he finds out... - What difference would it make? You left. With me or with another... And it was so long ago. - Yes, of course. - Let me tell you, if he didn't try to find out, it couldn't have bothered him much. Or maybe he didn't want to know. In any case, what we'e done is unforgivable. You are ashamed? I can't be ashamed for loving you. Come in. Monsieur Jean Brevent is here. He insists on seeing you. - I'm not here. - But he saw you come in. - It bothers you to see him? - Not at all. It's for you. But I'd like to. I can listen. Well, let him in. - Are you afraid? - Of him? Hello, Captain. Hello, Sartori. - Hello. - Have a seat. - No, thanks. It seems that you've met? Yes. Well, what can I do for you? Nothing. I wanted to find out. And I have. I assume you wanted to know if Catherine was happy? I think I can assure you that she is. I wanted to know for whom she left me. - What? You didn't know? - No. I thought Catherine had written to you. Catherine? I didn't write. As you can see, it isn't my fault. Had I known... I understand how you feel. It must be a shock... Let's not exaggerate. Well, I'll take my leave. - Jean, don't you want to... - No, no, I've got all I wanted. You know that we could do, Captain? We're staying at the Plaza. Why don't we have dinner tonight, the three of us? Great idea! Call us here, and we'll make an appointment. Agreed. Fine. If he calls, I'm never here. Okay, monsieur. My poor dear, you look worried. But it's all over now. It was an ugly moment to go through and that's all. Oh, please! With you, everything works out, all is fine, and everybody's happy. Come on, after a nice little dinner, you won't think about it anymore. Yeah...A nice little dinner and we won't think about it anymore... It appears that, you're the trumpet player... And you're the publicist tenant? Oh, you mustn't cry like that. You'll get it rusty. Let me tell you, that you play so-so. To criticize is easy, to create is hard. No slogans, or I'll make you eat the trumpet. Are you drunk? So are you. Poor publicist! Poor trumpet player! Since you're so young, so sad and so nice, I'll play you a tune. Sad, isn't it? - You're very sensitive. - Oh, yes. Stop, mom has a class. Come here, femme fatale! You love him? Then I'll have to fix this. You love her? - Oh, yes! But you buy your clothes at Galbar's, right? - No, why? - Then, you have a chance to be happy. Follow me, both of you. Oh, but I can't hear anything! "...The visits that receive your charms..." They need to hear you in the balcony! That's the ABC of the profession! "...The visits that receive your charms... "That he's 200 steps away from you doesn't mean he hates you..." Go on! "Without a doubt, madame, and my fervor is such..." "But that's too much!" She tells you to squeeze her, so squeeze! - Squeeze her tight so she doesn't escape. - I'm squeezing, madame, I'm squeezing. Look, you're holding her hand as if it were a plate! "...If it's because I'm overzealous..." - Be bold, Tartuffe! "I never intended to hurt you.... "I wanted to feel the fabric of your habit, which is so soft... Thanks to you, I'm very ticklish." Anthony, she tells you that you tickle her. Don't you understand?! This doesn't cut it, kids, You need to work on it. Shimene! Le Cid. What is this? This course is done. Class is over. - What's wrong with you, Jean? - Juliette! I need to speak with you. That's all for today, kids. Goodbye, madame. You again?! He has my permission. Come. You'll see, Jean will fix everything. He took away your trumpet? - Is what you have to tell me that urgent? - Yes. Francois! King Francois didn't die in Paris, Prepare the knives! Here's the grinder! It's the prefect's table! Are you drunk ?! Yes, I'm drunk. - Have you eaten, Jean? - No. And I don't care. - I'll make you two fried eggs. Keep quiet, Juliette. I'm suffering and I don't know how to deal with it. What happened? I saw Catherine. I still love her and I want to kill her. Jean, you have to go to bed. She was with Robert Sartori. - Your friend? - Yes. They got me. They killed me. They did. But I will have my revenge! - We'll talk tomorrow. No! No, no, no. We won't talk... I'll have my revenge, Juliette. Come on, let's go. The abominable Sartori! I gave him half my blood in the war. Well, it'll be spilled. What if I can get her back one way or another? I'd be exonerated, madame. Absolutely, Juliette. I'd even say I'd be applauded. The jury will make me a winner. You don't give a damn, you. Kitty, kitty... Come with me. Here...kitty, kitty! You see, Juliette, everybody abandons me. I don't know how to love. Can I get my trumpet back? - Will you get out! - Don't hurt him, Juliette. The trumpet in nice, huh? Both of you, or rather the three of you, if we count the trumpet, wait for me in the living room. And I don't want to hear you! Thanks, Jean. And behave yourselves. I intend to go in without knocking. Try to forget her, Jean. What did she say to you? She left me for a coat. 5 years of separation and her first question was, Do you still have your old Traction? I told her that I have an American car. That'll teach her. You, Juliette, can't even imagine what it means to be despised for years by the woman you love. But I know it. And it's over! I've made it! I'm a big shot! I have a beautiful car. - Very good. It makes me happy. And since when? - Since... From tomorrow morning. You, Brevent, who has taste: Which campaign would you choose for a toothpaste? Uh, I don't know. That one? - No, I chose this one. - This still amuses you? - It will always amuse me. - Don't deprive yourself, pal. - You're going to answer? - Yes, I will. Hello? Is that you, Jean? Wait a second. - Okay. I'm waiting. I'm listening. I'd like to see you, Catherine. But...you know, I'm taking the train Sunday evening. I don't have a minute to myself. Find a way. I need to talk to you. You have a lot to tell me? Uh, that's... Well, you're leaving Sunday and we may not see each other ever again, so I thought it would be wise and reasonable to get a divorce. Then everything will be in order. Are you listening to me? Yes, of course. You're right. We need to get a lawyer to do this. But first, it would be better to have a talk. Don't you think? - Yes, of course. - When can you? Let me look at my schedule. Tomorrow I don't have a minute... Saturday, I'll be in London. What are you doing on Sunday? But I'm leaving Sunday evening! What about during the day? We could go to the countryside? Oh, yes! But wait a minute. I have to agree with Robert. But I'll fix everything. - Agreed. I'll pick up the two of you Sunday at 11. Both of us? Yes, it would be better if he were present to discuss the divorce. Agreed? I count on both of you. You see... Sorry, I can't talk on the phone for too long. When you go shopping, maybe you could stop by here in the afternoon? - Yes? At what time? - Wait, hold the line. - Mireille! - Yes, Monsieur Brevent? - The meeting with the boss is at 5? - Yes, Monsieur Brevent. Thank you. 5 o'clock works? - Fine. 17, Champs Elysees. Wait, I'll mark it in my appointment book. 5 o'clock. 17, Champs Elysees. Divorce. Until tonight, Jean. Who was it? Jean. He asked me to pass by his office this afternoon. - What does he want? - A divorce. Great idea! We'll be able to get married. That should make you happy. Yes, very. - It's no joke, huh? - With me you have nothing to fear. - You're not going to burst into laughter? - No, monsieur. I don't understand why you're doing this. It's not like you. Mireille, I'm not like myself anymore. - So? - Here it is. She doesn't look real. Yes. This is the new pinup girl for Vandal bras. Yes, my friend, this will do. Well, we agree about everything? - Yes, everything. You know, you have nothing to fear. I may not be very smart, but I have an excellent memory. - This is so you won't forget anything. Especially the final scene. I wouldn't want to stay with the boss for more than 5 minutes. You can count on me for the final scene. And this is so you'll forget everything afterwards. Despite your memory... Alright. Thanks a lot, Monsieur Brevent. So, this lady will be here in a minute. I'll appear in the corridor, as if by chance. All clear? - Yes, boss. Alright then. Your number is coming up very soon. Monsieur Brevent, please. Have a seat, madame, The boss will be with you soon. - The boss? - Yes, madame. The boss. This is PubliParis. - I can read, pal! Chief Executive Officer Jean Brevent. - Since when? - 4 months. Prior to that, he was just a director, not Chief Executive Officer. - You are the Chief Executive Officer? - Not for you. This isn't the maid! - Of course, I'm not the maid! - Over there, Juliette. I'll explain later. Where are you taking me? I have important news for you! - Here comes another elevator! - Take your place! Monsieur Brevent, please. Monsieur Brevent, please. - The boss will see you soon. - The boss? PubliParis. Monsieur Brevent, Chief Executive Officer. Since when? 4 months. Prior to that, he was just director, not Chief Executive Officer. So, there's nobody else above him? The President, Monsieur Saunier, but we never see him. When we say 'boss,' it's Monsieur Brevent. I see... Please have a seat, madame. He's a real winner. Everybody loves him. Take me, for example. I'd give my life for him! He pays the rent for my elderly mother, paid for my daughter's operation... 2 plane tickets for Monsieur Brevent. For the 29th. He leaves with the Minister. He works too hard. For mustard, which would you choose? They're both bad. Do them again! We get angry...and it's wrong. - Hello, Chief Executive Officer! - Hello, Catherine! Come into my office. I'm not in for anybody. Okay, Mr. Chief Executive Officer. Designers. Office of bank trusts. Media purchases. Suggestion box. You're wonderful, Jean! Let's not exaggerate. - You've lost weight. - Since yesterday? You work too hard. This is huge! Yes, it's big company. Look. The Designers' Office. - Hello, Mr. Brevent. - Yes, do a good job, kids! - What's with him? - I wish I knew! Oh, wow! Have a seat. She's pretty! She doesn't look real. Yes, so they say. What's her name? Ri...Ri...Risette? No, see, What can you say... I must admit that she can barely write. So, are you happy? Well...as you can see. And you? You are happy? Yes, of course. Of course? You know very well that the main thing is to regret nothing. I regretted plenty about you. But what can you do? After 5 years... Certainly. Did you suffer for a long time? It was very hard. The first few months... I wanted to tell you, Jean... I suffered too. We shouldn't have. In the end, it was good that I left since it brought you happiness. Yes, it's true...Alright. Let's talk about serious things, eh? Divorce. Ah, yes, divorce. Who's your lawyer? I don't have one. I said I was not to be disturbed! Excuse me... Mademoiselle, you know, "the terror...". She's unleashed! - But what is she doing here? Make her wait a little. You can't keep a woman waiting forever, but 3 minutes are doable, no? Oh, hell! - This would make a pretty sight. Make this scarce and tell Mireille to come in. Excuse me, but this would too long to explain. - Above all, it's useless. - We'll talk on Sunday. We're still on for eleven? - Well, of course. - Is Robert okay? - Yes. - Good. Come in. Take madame out to the small elevator. - All right, boss. - You don't envy me too much... - On top of it, you make women suffer. - They love it. Off you go! This idiot is capable of killing you. And that would be silly, huh? - You are satisfied? - Yes, yes. It worked, huh? You could say it was outstanding! And the airhead didn't see it coming. - It's my wife, pal! - Oh, sorry. It would be nice if you forgot that too. - Is that you, Catherine? - Yes. - Good evening, dear. - Good evening. - Did you see your husband? - Yes. The divorce won't be a problem. Well done! What were you doing in PubliParis? Housework? No. He's the Chief Executive Director. What?! - Are you surprised? - Admit that you are too. We were wrong. - Chief Executive Officer?! - Yes. And I saw with my own eyes. You can call if you don't believe me. Oh, no, I believe you. Go ahead and call. You don't believe me! If you insist... Hello? Mademoiselle, connect me to the PubliParis company, please. It's in order to please you. - I'm very pleased. - Good. Another of Brevent's ideas? But it's very good! Oh, just a minute. Connect me with Thomson & Callaghan Ltd. in New York. Hello, yes? Monsieur Robert Sartori, President of Textile Imports, is calling for the Chief Executive Officer. - Put him through. - It's for me, boss. - Alright, pal. - Hello? - The Chief Executive Officer? It's me, Robert. What can I do for you? Nothing, I just wanted to thank you for your understanding. That's nice, but you didn't have to call me for that. Sorry to interrupt, but New York is on the line. I'm sorry to leave you so soon, but New York comes first. You know how it is.. Ciao. Boss, it's New York. You should show more interest in what's goes on in higher echelons. What do you know... - Chartier, I'll talk to you later. - Okay, boss. You want to talk to me in private? Yes, boss. I have 3 favors to ask. - Three? - Yes. - Scotch? - No, thanks. I don't drink. - Bravo! I'm listening. The first favor? The first favor: I need a 3 month advance. Eh...Alright. - The second? - The second favor... Lend me your Chevrolet on Sunday. The company-owned Peugeot 403 is not enough for you? No, boss, I need your pretty, white car... - Agreed. My chauffeur will bring it to you on Sunday morning. - Thanks, boss. - The third favor? The third favor, since it's going so well... Don't stop halfway through... On Sunday, I'd like to use your estate in Montfort-Lamoreaux. I can't do that. I have 65 guests coming for the weekend. Well, take them your villa in Antibes. They'll be fine in Antibes. - It's very difficult. Believe me, it's not out of ill will... I know that well. You've always been very kind to me. Yes, yes! Thanks for the advance. Thanks for the car. Thanks for everything. I'm glad you're asking me all this. - You're glad? - Brevent, I'm glad that once again there's a woman in your life. But...I follow your advice, boss. You've found a beautiful girl? You want to dazzle her? - Dazzle her... to start with. That's stage one. - And the second? The second...innocuous, boss. Totally innocuous. - Come on, Jean, tell me everything. Would it annoy you terribly if I have the gall to ask you why you're asking me all this? Anyway, I'll do everything I can to help you. - I would also like to tell you... - Yes? Thank you, my Colonel. It's all good. Break it up. And don't be a fool. "The time for love is not too short. "My heart says so, my heart knows so. "It beats, beats, it only beats for you. "And if one day I'll cry, "Too bad for me, I will cry. "And yet you see that I'll wait for you. "Because it runs in the wind, "It runs throughout the day, "But always returns. "The time for love." Yes? - May I come in for 5 minutes? - Yes, of course. Nice of you to come visit me. When you play this song, it means you're sad. I'm barefoot...and cold. Well... Get on the bed. Have you seen Catherine since Thursday? No. It'll be okay with her? Yes and no. Is there nothing I can do to help you? The property that your father, the prefect, left you... - La Gulliere? - Yes. - Are you going there tomorrow? - No, it's so boring. - Me, I'd really like to go there. - Why? Tell me. No. You can't keep a secret. Yes, it's true. Don't say anything. Do you know where your mother puts the keys? - Yes. You want them? - Yes, please. But without her knowledge. I'll take them in the morning, when she takes her bath. Thank you. - Caroline. - Yes? If a man you love leaves with another woman, what would you do? A man I really love? - Yes. - I'd kill myself. Okay. - Caroline. - Yes? I'm giving you my record player. - No! - Yes. Does it make you happy? - I thought you cherished it. That's why I'm giving it to you. You can take it tomorrow when I'm gone. - Thank you. It's late. Go to sleep. You won't forget the keys tomorrow morning? - No, no. - Good night. I scared you? I didn't knock because of mother. Don't make too much of a mess. - Thank you. You'll never know what your mother and you meant to me these past 5 years. - Why do you say that? - No reason. It's the door. I'll get it. - Monsieur Brevent, please. - Yes, it's here. What for? Jean, a driver is asking for you. Yes, I'm coming. The car is downstairs, Monsieur Brevent. Here's the registration and keys. - Thank you. What's with this car? - It's a secret. - Again? You'll have to come back before we can have a talk. Yes, goodbye. Bye. I'll watch you leave. - What are you doing here? - Come take a look! Where did he get this Buick? It's a Chevrolet, mom. Jean! Jean! - Bye. My car! There he goes in full swing! Did he tell you where he was going? No, but I think, he's going to kidnap Catherine. I forbid you to touch Jean's stuff! He gave it to me. If you ask me, I think you've lost your tenant. Oh! It's the tape recorder ribbon! How about that! He threw out Catherine's song? The gun case? Tell me everything! - I don't know anything. He said he'd take revenge. He's going to kill her. If you know anything, speak up. Well, tell me! I gave him the keys to La Gulliere. - Well done! - I did the right thing? At least, I know where to find him. Get ready, let's go there! Come on! No, madame. I'm sorry. - Monsieur Sartori, please. - He left the hotel this morning. Are you sure? I sent his belongings by taxi to Saint-Lazare. One minute, please. Certainly. Try again in half an hour. And the lady who was with him? They left for Canada. If you'd like to leave a message? Swimsuit 35/12? Understood. Got it, madame. Well, all is lost... Hello? Well, alright. Take this, madame. I don't understand. - For me? - For you. These are roses, madame. Roses. A tribute to the twists of fate, to the stupidity of life. You couldn't understand, since you don't speak French. All the rest doesn't matter. - I don't understand. - That's just what I said. - Thank you. - Yes. Just imagine him giving me these flowers... - I've no idea why... - It's amazing. But he's a very kind gentleman... Catherine! - Hello. - Hello. - This is Bandit. - Hello, Bandit. I brought you flowers. Thank you. How beautiful they are! The receptionist told me, that you had left in the morning. Robert, not me. So, it's just the two of us? Yes. Let's leave them with the concierge. But you told him that I wanted to to see him about the divorce? Yes, but he really wanted to hug his mother, before leaving on a trip. And you didn't go with him? Oh, I'll join him that night in Le Havre. Could you please take these flowers to my room? Will do, madame. You know, you're very handsome! Thank you. Oh, my roses! How very peculiar... - Well, shall we go? - Let's. Careful, Bandit! - Is this your car? - Yes. Superb! No no! Here, Bandit! Get in. We could cross the Atlantic in this... Actually, I like the old Traction better. It was more intimate. Well, I don't. Hey, don't sleep! Now is not the time! It'll well and good for you, but I played all night! Going to bed at 7 am and getting awakened by you at 10! Don't start freaking out. You have to take mother and me. - Where? - To La Gulliere. What a good idea. Patrick! For crying out loud! Patrick! Patrick! He clearly pays full attention... Not surprising, considering his lifestyle. So, wake up and give me the wheel. Madame, this is a sports car. It's very delicate. I had a Hispano when I started out, so... Yes, but Hispanos are accident-prone. No car can resist me! Your race car seems a bit skittish. We'll see if it has guts. Ah, but wait, the brake! - Where are we going? - To La Gulliere. It's a small country house I bought, but still didn't have time to put in order. - Jean. - Yes? Let's talk about the divorce, only when we part ways, not before. Okay? Fine. First, let's catch up to them. And when we catch up with them, what will we do? I'll take away his revolver, by hook or by crook. Jean will be very upset. Better that he be unhappy than a killer. He has a different opinion. Better to die than to live without love. But it's Catherine who's going to die! Can I put in a word? Tell it to my daughter. If we interfere too brutally, Monsieur Brevent risks shooting his wife without warning. You're right. Let's start gently. But we'll never catch up with him! Another one who doesn't want to budge. Do something! We aren't making any progress. I have an idea: Pass on the left. Hey slacker, are you asleep?! You snooty... - That one (is something)... Do you hear? It's our song. Do you still have the tape we made? "The time for love always returns, "Like a bird in a summer sky. "It comes and goes, "sometimes it stays, "and then suddenly flies away. "All lovers know very well "that it waits for you along the way. "A soft breeze, "that blows throughout the day, "and always comes back - the time for love." What is our first step going to be? A gas station. And our last step? Put it in 4th, or go grab a beer. Leave me alone, I know how to drive! But if it makes you happy... Is that better? If it comes to that, I like the 3rd quite a bit. Ah, women can't drive! - Oh, you... Don't take your hands off the wheel! I'll deal with Caroline myself, if it becomes necessary. - Fill her up, please. - Okay. Monsieur, is this the latest model? Yes, why? You don't like it? I do, a lot, but... I'd like to fill the tank, but where's the filler? Well... Look for it, pal, it's childish. - Is this a riddle? - No, but let him find it. That's his job, after all. - I'll look too. It amuses me. Me too. Sorry, madame. - Don't go there, look! - They're getting gas. It's going well, Caroline. We've got to go there. I'm scared. - I'm going to make a turn. - Careful! Be careful! Let's go. Did you understand me well? It worries me. She could succeed, with a bit of luck. She met me. That says it all. Oh, right, I forgot. Ah! I found it! Listen, you cheated. You knew but you didn't say! - You're relieved, huh? - Yeah... We'll have lunch somewhere around here. Here, choose the place. - Fill her up, please. - In a minute, mademoiselle. So, is it almost ready? One second, monsieur. This car has a big tank. Are you crazy? Scram! Come here, kitty. Look! Go! Bandit! Come, I must talk to you. Bandit, come here! Here, Bandit! Right now! Bandit! Bandit come here! Bandit! Leave this cat alone! - Please don't argue. - But I have no time. - Come! - What do you want? - The gun. - What gun? Don't play dumb. To kill for love. And, besides, she's too beautiful! One: my gun is in storage. Two: I don't want to see you. And three: Buzz off! - No! Okay, I'll leave. I won't say anything else. I'm gone. But first, tell me, Why do you want to make Catherine believe that you're the boss of PubliParis? Why did you borrow this car? Why all this bluff? It's my business. It concerns only me. Jean, I'm talking to you as a friend. Listen to me. You've got nothing to do with this business. And if you have a shred of friendship for me, leave me alone! - How much do I owe you? - 4800 francs, monsieur. Here... Keep the change. - Thank you, monsieur. Come over here, mademoiselle. I'll tend to you right away. I don't need gas. Well? He was furious. He said he no longer wanted to see me. And the gun? He didn't have it. He said it was in storage. You fool! Without the case? Oh, we have to start all over again! Fortunately, I know a shortcut that will make us gain 10km. We'll overtake them! I have an idea. We'll talk on the road. Hold on! - Attention! Attention! - There's no danger! Ladies and gentlemen, be reasonable! If everybody else behaved like this... - Don't worry, he knows what he's doing. Well, what did I tell you! - What is it? - A lady who's doing the same thing. This place is hideous! What noise! It's impossible to exchange a word! You have something important... but difficult... to tell me? Yes. That is to say, no. Jean. Yes? I know now that you've changed. Previously, you were sure of yourself. Do you remember the pharmacy? Today you're... uncertain... It seems to me that you hesitate. I never hesitate If I need to do something. - Then do it. - What? Speak! Tell me what you have to say to me. I have nothing to say, Catherine. You asked me to wait before discussing anything serious. Yes, it's true. You're right. Jean! Look behind you: The girl from the gas station. What girl? The one who drove a sportscar. You think? What is she doing here with a policeman? Monsieur, there's a policeman who wants to speak with you. With me? Your car was in an accident caused by this young lady. Then I have to go. Excuse me for a moment. - I hope it's nothing serious. No, I'll fix it right away. So? Monsieur, your car has just been in an accident. So, we must make a report. - Yes, yes. You again! - Madame, madame! - What's with this one? Madame, you're in mortal danger! - What?! - I beg you, come with me! It's very serious! Explain to him that now is not the time! Bandit, shut up! Monsieur has come to save my life! Come on. - You did that? - No, my boyfriend did. Where is that jerk? He parked his car in a garage. And you think it's funny? For you? Ah, here's the famous Catherine! Quick! Come! Get in. We'll talk on the way. - Who are you, madame? - Juliette Armier. Your husband has been renting a room from me for 5 years, which means that I know you well. - Doubtless. This is my future son in law. The young girl, who bumped into your car, is my daughter. - Your fiancee? - Yes, madame. Patrick, go join Caroline. Delay Jean as long as possible. We'll see each other in Paris. Get in, we have little time. - But I don't want to leave Jean! But you didn't understand me. He wants to kill you! So, that's what it is... Don't stay with him today. Give him time to calm down. But I want to stay with him. I love him. I understand you. He's a classy guy, good looking too. The night he arrived at our place, he was so miserable, that it was enough to open a window, for him to have jumped out. Oh, shut up! For 5 years, he hasn't stopped suffering. And very discreetly. This is a man, a real one. Don't make him a killer. Let's go! No...No, I'm staying. If he wants to kill me, it's because he still loves me. Then I'll talk to him. Oh, no, I beg you, He mustn't know! But he wants to kill you! That's his right. I guess I deserved it. Of course, I can't get on my knees to protect you, but I'll follow you from a distance. - Thank you. - I'm doing it for him. Then thank you for him. Okay, enough already. - And the report? - I don't need it. - So, who do I inform? - It wasn't me who informed you - about it... - Madame, don't leave. I beg you! Officer, stop her from leaving! Say, do you take me for a clown? You'll have to explain yourself. - It is far? - No. We have plenty of time. My train leaves at 10. At 10 on the dot, I know. As you say, we have plenty of time. - Come on, hop in! - Okay. We could have done without this policeman business. - It's here? - Yes. Let's leave the car here, because the gate hasn't been repaired yet. You stay here and behave well. You're not taking the dog? No, it's not worth it. He becomes dangerous when he's afraid. Why would he be afraid? He doesn't know the house. So long, Bandit. It's wild! Yes. I can't stand gardeners. And here's the house - La Gulliere. Would you like to take a look? - Of course. But, no. An uninhabited house is cold, gloomy... I'd rather stay in the sun. - Alright. The grass is all warm. Let's not stay here. Come. Why? I'm fine here. Don't be childish, let's go. As you wish. - Jean. - Yes? Why didn't you ever hurt me? What do you mean? All those who love each other, do it sooner or later. But from the moment we met, you never did that. So much the better. But you could have, when I left you. You could've tried to take revenge. And you never even tried to find me. It was what you wanted. Why have you always been so good to me? - Out of cowardice. - Oh, no! No, you're the opposite of a coward. Or maybe it just because... you loved me? Very much? Maybe that was it. Jean! If you took me in your arms, I'd realize that you forgave me, and everything could start over again! Let's not talk nonsense. It's too late now for all this. No matter what happens, this is the most beautiful Sunday in my life! It's stalling... What's going on? - We ran out of gas. - Okay, I get it. La Gulliere is 5 minutes away. I'll go there on foot. - I'll go with you. - Yes, Mother, we'll go with you. No, stay here. And you too. Keep an eye on the car and my daughter. I prefer to go alone. This no business for kids. I should have put on my dance slippers. Jean! Jean, are you alright? I'm all wet. - Don't laugh at me! - I can't help it. Don't laugh! I'm perfectly capable of killing you! But, I know, my dear! I really wanted to kill you! Look, bitch! But nobody ever believes me! But I do believe you! No! You just say that to please me. Just look at the killer, standing ass-deep in water! - Get out of there! - No, I won't! Take my hand! No thanks. I did it once. That's enough. But I love you, fool! Do not try so hard, I'm not a big boss! I don' have an American car. - But I knew it! You knew! Don't you understand that I love you for who you are?! It's not enough. You can't fool a guy like me with a few kind words. - You must try! - No, I don't want to. I know you. At the first opportunity... - No, I swear to you! Shut up! You love money too much! All women are like that! You're not a bigger a bitch than others, but you're still a bitch! After all, you warned me. I can't complain. - Jean, let's try anyway! - No, I don't want to! - I'm begging you, my dear! - No, I can't! I don't have the courage. Jean! Jean! Jean! - Are you going to Paris? - Yes. - Can you give me a lift? - I can't refuse given the state you're in. Get in. Where is he? - Gone. - But what's happened? Nothing. Everything is lost. Still, you're alive and that's what counts. As far as I'm concerned, that is not what counts. Come. Get in. I'll drive. I speak Chevrolet. And your train? I didn't take it. So you're staying? If you want me to. You fool! Let's go. So you still have your Traction? Always. Subtitles by feufollet77 Up in OS by Jaf - 27/11/2023
