Tata brought me here to this land he calls the bottom of the earth. But this is where I found my sea and my freedom, my family. ♪ If you hear me now ♪ ♪ Please don't think ♪ ♪ I've forgotten everything ♪ ♪ Can you hear me now? ♪ ♪ Shadows of the past ♪ ♪ Let them go ♪ ♪ Love can break down Barriers ♪ ♪ Can you hear me now ♪ ♪ Broken images ♪ ♪ Broken dreams ♪ ♪ Broken English promises ♪ ♪ Can you hear me now? ♪ ♪ Another country ♪ ♪ Another place Where we can be ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ Another country ♪ ♪ Another state of mind You see ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ Another country ♪ ♪ Another place Where we can be ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ Another country ♪ ♪ Another state of mind We'll see ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ You and me ♪
