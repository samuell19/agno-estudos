We've arrived. OK Boss! Yes? Do you see the factory on the far right? From there to the warehouse on the left is the area we plan to redevelop When the New Bay Area Project completes, this whole area will turn into a beautiful futuristic town. For that, our redevelopment plan needs to win at the next competition. It was your father's dream to have the leadership over the bay area. Hmm. Yea. Yes Boss, don't cross that line! There's a new type of norovirus spreading over there. Wake up. What is wrong with you? The employees are all waiting for your instructions. What happened? What is troubling you? It's your destiny to be leading this company. Stop lamenting yourself. In the end, we are all like cogwheels. And you are the one cog that stands out in the middle of the mechanism. If you don't rotate, no one else can. Come on, wake up now. Boss Wake up. Be careful there. The steps are not stable. Got it Beautiful New Bay Area Project… The top floor will be a penthouse, surrounded on the four sides by large balconies. If we build large balconies at this height, don't you think the wind will be too strong? Hanging out the washing might be complicated. For this apartment, we will limit the height to less than 60 meters. Takako, move that one over there too. Yes Hey Do you remember me? We met 2 days ago. At the back of the warehouse. You don't remember? Sorry, I'm working right now. It's ok. It's normal that you don't remember. But… I came back because I wanted to tell you something. How should I say? You suddenly appeared to me and you saved me. To see you was like a shock. As if I was hit by the thunder. I really mean it. All of a sudden there was light in my dark life. It's hard to put into words. But I hope you understand what I'm saying. Sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. Wait a minute! You shouldn't go this way with me. Huh? Where are you? Where are you? Heeey! Where are you gone? Show up to me again, please! Hey! Where are you? Hey!! Hey! Damn! Was this an illusion? I was born in the sea. In a deep place at the bottom of the sea. It's a world that no human probably ever saw. It's a beautiful place. Of course it's a place of many battles. The strong ones attack the weak ones without mercy and swallow their head first. The weak ones try desperately to resist, but eventually they understand and die accepting their fate. The same goes for the strong ones. They understand that the one they just swallowed will be part of their blood and flesh. They accept that they are the ones surviving. That's the way battles should go. It's an action where mutual understanding and acceptance are exchanged. But in this world here… Dad. Yes… Nothing much new here. I'm reasonable Don't worry Ok I'll be here for a while more, but I'll let you know when time has come to return I'm alright. It's quite interesting here too. I am taking good care of the name I inherited from you. I won't do that. I promise. Yes Bye. No! Stop it! Let me go. Let me go I said stop! Where are those numbers coming from? From these statistics. You just found those on the internet, didn't you? This will convince no one. We have no chance to win the competition with this. Do it again. Hey, you there! What are you doing? I told you not to do just calculations but to go directly to the construction company and negociate a discount. Boss, here are the final results. Thank you very much. What happened? There's a mouse. A mouse? Where? Hey! Do something about it! Please listen. You cannot spend your life here. You need to go to somewhere wider than this place. I am actually the boss of this company. I'm the second generation dummy boss. I'm free to do whatever I want. And I just gave up on the company. Don't you wanna leave this place and come with me? Shall we have lunch downtown? Then shopping? I have money. Or maybe you prefer going to a theme park? I know! Let's go to the other side of the sea. To America? Or anywhere else. I'll take you wherever you want. You're just saying nonsense. Yea, it may be nonsense. But you made me behave like this. Of course I wished it. That's why I want to grant your wishes too. At any price. Sorry, I like it here. How unfortunate. In a month's time, this area will be completely destroyed. How could you do this? It has been already decided. I gave my permission. It will all start automatically. The "Beautiful Bay Area" project will shape a new future. Go away. Wait! Don't walk out on me. I used to be a cogwheel, uselessly spinning at the centre of a mechanism. But I escaped. And now I am rolling on the ground. If you abandon me, I wouldn't know in which direction to roll. Please stay with me. I'm sorry, but my answer is "No". No? But why? I cannot abandon this place. I see… What a disappointment… I was wrong about you. Who do you think you are? I thought you were special just because of this place. I won't come again. But, just let me know your name. I don't want to tell you. Come on. Just your name. No way. What's wrong with you? All of you here will turn adrift and end up dying miserably. Tanigawa Takako I got it! Tanigawa Takako, I'm keeping this name card! Wait! Give it back to me. Boss, get in. Quick! Oh! Excuse me. Boss. Could you please check the account settlement. Hmmm By the way… This Tanigawa Takako… What do we do if she comes to get her name card back? Hmm… let's see… Shall we turn her back? Call the security and throw her out. May I ask your name? I want to see the president. May I ask why? I want him to give me back something he took. Wait a moment, please. Are you Tanigawa Takako? Yes. This way please. I knew you'd come back. You're incredible. It's exactly what I thought. Give it back to me. Nope Hey! Come on, give it back to me. Is this that valuable to you? How beautiful…
