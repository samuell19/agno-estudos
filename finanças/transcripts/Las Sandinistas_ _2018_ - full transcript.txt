We say that there are two faces of memory. I tend to associate my life with certain details, in order to awaken memories, to bring moments back to life. If I think of coffee with milk, I think of a first communion. The light of days changing. I think that takes you to different parts In my house I was raised to do whatever I wanted to do. N?o me colocavam limites. My house wasn't traditional in that way. It was an environment where our education was prioritized. My father taught us to handle weapons as a distraction, for fun. But there are moments of my life from which I remember absolutely nothing. I mean, there are certain things, certain moments, that are completely erased. So there are two kinds of experience; the experience of memories but also the experience of the erasure of the memory. Dora Maria, the warrior girl, who caused the tyrant's heart to tremble in rage. We were raised to view people as our equals, not as beneath us. My father taught us there were different classes of people, in the sense that this was a problem. - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - We have nothing. No chickens, nothing. We can't have anything. There was repression, no freedom, and extreme poverty.

I was a teacher at a school, in a poor neighborhood. It was common to see kids fainting or in pain. These kids didn't have any meal to eat in school. That made me go from a passive attitude to an active one. At that time, I thought that I could influence the creation of a different political system. I hoped for a society with social justice, without poverty, with tranquility, without scarcity. A free society. That motivated me to participate, to be a social activist in Matagalpa. This repression of Somoza also came to my house. They murdered my whole family. Even my cousin, an 18-year-old girl. She was pregnant. They murdered her, and cut her baby out with a bayonet. Women's only role was to stay home and raise kids. We didn't have rights, or education. I became a leader of my high school student movement. We supported the National Teachers' and Hospital Worker strikes, to confront the Dictator. Student leaders were in and out of prison. Then there was strong repression of student protests. The earthquake was definitely a breaking point in the population's views towards the dictatorship. Distribution of earthquake aid was virtually nonexistent. And there was tremendous corruption. After the earthquake the repression grew, and life became incredibly hard. I got radicalized then, in my vision of what the Somoza dictatorship was, and the way in which the Dictator could be confronted. For women there was a profound transformation, not only political but existential. We couldn't fight it through the vote. We couldn't fight it with civil political mobilization. So I slowly reached the conclusion that armed struggle was the only way to confront the dictator. The Sandinista Front (FSLN), vanguard of the Nicaraguan people, is interested in helping all the exploited people. These guns were donated by the people. This just Nicaraguan fight is for the liberation of humanity. "Freedom or death" is our call. The main goal of the FSLN (Sandinista Front) was the eradication of poverty and the dictatorship. From women's perspective, the FSLN's goal was to fully incorporate women to society. Why did you join the revolution? To get rid of Somoza and to see a free Nicaragua. Any other reasons? Because I liked it. I joined the Sandinista Front in '74. My dream was to make a difference for women, and to have a different Nicaragua. We are going to fight this unequal fight, even though we have nothing. I had a good relationship with my parents, as good a relationship as any teenager can have with their parents. So it was difficult for me to decide to go underground. I was 18 years old. This had a strong impact on me. My dad used to try to give me all kinds of advice. I missed that time with my parents. I feel the time I lived with my parents was so short. I didn't tell them. I wrote them a letter that they'd receive 4 or 5 days after I'd already left to the underground. I just left. I knew that I may not ever return. What is clandestine life like? It's difficult at first. Suddenly I could only come out of the house at certain hours of night. When I came out for the first time in daylight, I felt so, so weird. What is your profession? I'm a corporate lawyer. I would say, "If other women can do it, why can't I?" The National Guard was very well-armed. We were just a group of poorly-armed kids. We trained whoever didn't know how to handle weapons. Roger Nu√±ez, he couldn't close the correct eye when shooting. He had to use an eye patch to shoot, but after he became a good shooter. My ex-husband never imagined I had grenades, .22 rifles, and contact bombs in my closet. When he left for work I took his pistol, and bang bang bang! shooting bullets into the air. In the air, yes. I was very mischievous. We were making homemade bombs - Molotov. You don't separate from that feeling that today was probably your last day alive. Life in the main camp wasn't a fairy tale. We started our training at 5 a.m. Food was a huge problem. The lack of food was critical. All we ate were wild fruits, and animals we hunted. But we always continued our study schedule, as peasants we had to learn how to read. When we had our menstrual periods, we didn't have any sanitary pads or anything. We just had to go wash in the river with our clothes on, but we continued just the same. We did it with the most profound sense of sacrifice, for an ideal. That gives you joy. There was a very difficult period. There were many deaths of comrades in different places, Nandaime, Jinotepe. This is easy. While I was studying medicine in Guadalajara, Somoza was murdering students in Leon, and I couldn't tolerate that. Somoza's not a normal man. When he is murdering his own people, destroying the cities, his Guard kills old people, women and children. And Somoza says, "Nothing happened." Somoza is actually convinced that nothing has happened. Somoza had declared that the FSLN didn't even exist. He thought all the FSLN leaders were either dead, or in prison. All of that period was used to plan a high magnitude strike against Somoza. December 27, 1974. The Sandinista Front makes itself known to the world with a bold strike. We chose the Castillo House party, because it honored US Ambassador Shelton. Because there is in Nicaragua a tradition of US intervention against our country. We were informed of the mission's details, that made us switch to combat mode. We were told to take over two taxis, and proceeded to the mission. Marcos, Commander "0" was the first to jump out of the car, with a pistol - exchanging fire with the guards. Castillo came out shooting, and he shot one of our companeros. In the middle of the battle, Marcos calls Somoza on the phone. He tells Somoza that if they keep shooting, the Chilean ambassador would be the first one executed. So then we made our demands. Somoza accepted. Although, we didn't get the $5 million dollars, we did get $1 million. So we left with 16 prisoners including National Directorate member Daniel Ortega. By launching this raid, we broke the silence and we put the dictatorship on alert. What changed after Castillo's raid was the model of repression, there was intense repression and there was a state of siege, and at some point martial law. I only felt doubts when I gave birth to my son, because I had a baby underground. When I had to send away my son, because I couldn't continue my underground fight with a baby, that was the only moment in my career when I felt doubts. I was part of this group of medical students sent to Cuba to study war surgery. Then we spent several months doing military training in a base that the Cubans had. We were super well-trained for rural, mountain guerrilla. I learned to handle the most important weapons: revolver, pistols, machine guns, rocket launchers. In combat, I got shot in my left foot. It still hurts me a lot. We were halfway down, on the road to Matagalpa. A vehicle passed ahead of us, then started shooting at us. It was a thick rain of bullets. I was captured. And I was put in a room - shackled, and stripped naked. And then I was beaten, and subjected to threatening interrogations. My female friends were raped. For the whole year I was in prison, I was never able to touch my son. In general most of its leaders were chauvinists. There was no critical debate in the FSLN to change that reality. Women also allow men to be chauvinists, therefore women are also chauvinists. Women's role tended to mimic the Nicaraguan society model, so women in the FSLN, while they were in the mountains, they would do the same chores that they do at home, the cooking, and the washing. Then US President Carter broke the glass with a personal letter to Somoza in which he congratulated Somoza on his supposed improvement in human rights in Nicaragua. Three loans of $40, $50, and $60 million dollars (to the Somoza government) were announced shortly after. The plan was so simple it seemed insane. To take the National Palace of Managua, in full daylight, with only 25 people. In Nicaraguan history, Historians will see two periods in history: before the Palace Raid, and after the Palace Raid. The operation finally took form in the face of the dictatorship crisis of 1978. We spent 8 years pitching the Palace operation. The commando was small, 25 people. I was the only woman, and most of the men were 17-18 year old boys. 80% of them had never fired a weapon. I led the mission, 2nd was Hugo Torres, 3rd was Dora Maria. The inner circle of the FSLN alleged that I was too tough, that I didn't want any negotiations. They said all I wanted was to impose my will. So, the inner circle of the FSLN designated Dora Maria in charge of negotiations. In the Palace, there were between 1,500 and 2,000 people, people working in state ministries, Congressmen, bodyguards, soldiers, etc. We were going to grab the tiger by the balls and hold on. It was a very complicated thing. I was always scared in combat. Combat always frightened me. Maybe the only time I wasn't scared was the 1st combat, because I had no idea what I'd gotten into. We didn't have any problems entering the Palace because we managed to disarm the guards by telling them we were an elite commando from the National Guard, and they followed our orders. But as soon as we reached the front of the Session hall, the shooting started from the back and the front. My squad was watching the main entrance when the group patrolling the street entered and started shooting. There was at least one armed escort who had a pistol. He had a pistol. Yes, it's an extremely difficult circumstance. When fighting in the mountains, you can't see the people you shoot. But when you have to shoot and you see, it is not easy. We were revolutionary gentlemen, so we treated the congressmen well. We had to impose our demands. A great part of the tension has to do with the negotiation. The negotiation is what will allow you to leave, or not leave. That negotiation was very tense. The negotiations stalled, and we gave too many concessions with the ransom. I remember that we were all tired. Dora Maria was falling asleep, I saw her rifle almost hit the floor, and she woke up! Answering me when I was talking. Time was against us. Time is always in favor of the ones on the outside. Despite the threats of the National Guard, a crowd of people fill the streets to escort the victorious commando to the airport. In the end we accepted a ransom of only $500,000 dollars. It was an organized, historic assault, against imperialism and all its forces. It was the cleanest commando operation in human history. I'm climbing the stairs when I hear the applause from the people, then I turn and I wave to the crowd. In the last 2 years women's participation was massive, and in insurrectional situations, relationships change. I was in charge of a war front, the western front. That massacre was terrible for us. This was the most emotionally devastating event I'd ever experienced, in my entire life. Devastating. Then they sent me there, to take charge of Leon. Insurrectional forces are anarchical forces. The art is when the insurrection becomes an action of the masses, you can stage the siege on the National Guard everywhere, and groups are doing it all over the country, at the same time. It's a tremendous process of organization. You must understand something else: that all the organized political forces must work together in service of the Insurrection. I was part of the high command of Managua, which was comprised of two men and a woman. I participated directly, among the combatants. We organized a battalion. The Guard pounded us with bombs, between Masaya and Managua. There are estimates that close to 70 populist combatants perished. In Granada, the 2nd most important city after Leon, I was very important in the defeat of the garrison. It's the subject of a poem by Eduardo Galeano, called "Las Comandantes". The city of Granada. The stronghold of the Dictator, is about to fall. Who's the Commander? Give me your name! The Colonel crosses the street, a bandana covers his face. "Don't shoot!" The commander appears and says: "I come to negotiate the conditions." He said to me, "I want to speak to the boss." I said to him, "I am the boss." The Commander is me, says Monica Baltodano. Then he says, "I do not surrender to a woman." "I don't surrender to a woman!" growled the Colonel, a haughty macho. And then he surrendered. We had huge expectations of change. It was a beautiful phase, because it was filled with hope. Only after Victory do you realize you're making history. We're not going to see the benefits tomorrow; not in 3 or 4 days. We all have to make sacrifices this 1st year, because the future of this country is now in the hands of the people. They couldn't understand either why the Indians or the black people were rebelling. The Miskito Indians. Workers could get organized, people started organizing in their communities, women got organized, peasants too. I was in charge of the 2nd military region, Leon and Chinandega. Afterwards I was sent to Managua to lead political work and organizing of masses. Students joined the literacy crusade, there was a lot of energy and social activism. Now we are reborn; Everything is so much better, because we are learning. I completed primary school in a military school. I attended school at night and on Sundays, and somehow I was able to finish secondary school. I was the first woman that was Minister of Health. What are you going to do with the Ministry of Health? You have to see the children, women, and old persons. For social problems, there are common solutions. Once Reagan's administration took power, and started pumping money into the Contras, the Contra military capacity became enormous. I had to join the war, all over again, to defend my country. So, I don't have a different life. My life is to defend my country. We had our first combat experience in Cardenas. The Contras used to wear blue uniforms. Whenever we saw something blue, we knew that we had to shoot. When you see during the battle all your comrades next to you, then you see one of them dead, then another, and you think that the ones right next to you are alive, but when you look at them they're all dead. The next five years were extremely complicated. The Contra war affected all of Nicaraguan society, both in the city and the countryside. The Department of Health had a crisis, increased services, resources, and personnel. Then the main challenge was to deal with those circumstances like the lack of resources without deteriorating services for the people's health care, and I think we achieved that. We really managed to do that somehow without dismantling the services due to the lack of resources. You think that once you take the first step, it's impossible to go back. But life is not like that. Social processes are not linear, they are like rivers, they swing back and forth, they are much more complex. Why was Dora not accepted to be a part of the Directorate? None of the women were... After the victory, an in-depth gender equality debate was never contemplated. There was an obvious difference between roles women could play, and could not. The point is when it's not admitted the problem exists, there can't be a change in attitude. Men have a position of power in some cases without realizing. Part of that power is subtle, invisible. You don't have change without friction in society. Nobody cedes power voluntarily. That's the way it is. In Nicaragua there is still a very interesting autonomous feminist movement that I think you talked about with Sofia. The government we have now cares about its people, they care about our kids' education, they ensure kids get free medicine, and free school. We wanted a profound revolution, a real revolution, in freedom and democracy. And that's what Rosario and Daniel Ortega are doing right now. We say that there are two faces of memory. The tomb of my brother Franklin. They ripped the plaque off. I approach my comrade, the Mayor and say: I can, I can still work! But no, there's no space for me. I feel that they have changed the interpretation of history, to attribute the protagonism to others like Eden Pastora, who match the politics of Daniel Ortega. The way they're spinning the history of the fight against the dictator, on the part of Ortega and Murillo, is to erase everyone. They're not only erasing Hugo and me, no they're erasing everyone. Especially those who had leadership positions, or were great leaders in the fight against the dictator. So was Monica Baltodano leading the attack on Granada? No. What about those of us who led the Leon insurrection? Almost nothing. There are two kinds of experience; the experience of memories but also the experience of the erasure of the memory. There has been a huge increase in violence against women, and levels of rape. Currently we have many cases of 11-14 year old girls who are pregnant after being raped. This year we have 64 cases of femicide in the country. ORTEGA - RAPIST I was raped, assaulted, and sexually harassed (by Ortega) and I am filing criminal charges. There is a subtle violence, a violence of control. The violence of humiliation, the violence of fear. This is the power of control, and we are currently experiencing it in this country. I thought that changing the system would be easier. But time tells you that changing the system is neither easy nor fast. We now have a health system in crisis, an education system of deplorable quality, and these were the axis of the social policies of the revolution. In Nicaragua, little by little, thousands of peasant families are going to lose their land. They're taking our land away. We are not safe other places. Ortega cannot come and give our land away. The Rosicrucians believe imagination is stronger than willpower. You use your imagination, not your will. We're fighting an information guerrilla war. It's a fight, first and foremost informative. And then after the information, comes the mobilization. All sexual violence is totally unacceptable and should be rejected by Nicaraguan society, and punished severely by the laws. I've always liked to provoke all issues related to women. I believe that a main problem for women is invisibility. Legendary guerrilla fighter Dora Maria Tellez stays firm in her hunger strike, completing day 7. My hunger strike arose out of great necessity, people's freedom to politically participate was threatened, and the MRS's legal life as a political party was also at stake. "Jail for femicides" People need to get on the street, hundreds, thousands. There is no remedy apart from this. "FOR OUR RIGHT TO CHOOSE" They dismantled our structure, we picked it up. They dismantled it again, we picked it up again. We never get intimidated in front of anyone. My point is, we are going to fight for transparent, competitive, and clean elections. This is going to be a bloodbath. This man is playing with everybody's lives, he is playing with fire. We have to go 100 years in the future and look back to understand the magnitude of what has dramatically changed in Nicaragua. Did you know the story of your grandmother? No. Do you think that your grandmother is brave? Yes. Why do you think your grandmother is brave? Because of all the work that she has done she earned her life. I feel a great sense of identity with people who are discriminated against. No one gave us handouts as women in the revolution, we earned them. We earned that space. We fought for it, and we died for that space. It's very clear that women fight for that space, we fight all the way, to the last consequence. It's a tremendous process of organization. All the organized political forces must work together in service of the revolution. We might not have known each other, but we do know each other, memory will cover with a patina of gold this brief moment of our lives lives in their different trajectories which touched, barely and now return again to their orbits. Intimacy is constructed on the tip of untarnished words, until they are returned to us pure. - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle - - Untranslated subtitle -
