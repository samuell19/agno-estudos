Depends on the story. Berta, this is woman ... Rebecca. - She's looking for a room. Are you from the west? Rebecca doesn't want to take anything away from us. Or? Give me some time - Nobody will take anything away from us. My mother lives in this house since 1911. She has Hindenburg, Hitler, Stalin and Honecker survived! - Calm down. We are only looking for a place to sleep. To calm down for your book on glass to research, right? Glass? The devil is supposed to do that to fetch!

You don't get anything. - You're welcome?! You should prevent that she comes here You ex-boxer! - I stood for weeks before this psychiatry. If you me bounce for my fee ... (energetic) You won't get a penny! If the wall hadn't fallen, then I would be world champion now. And if you don't pay me then that's a mistake Mrs. Thalberg. 'N evening, boys. Where's Cinderella? Did you buy the shoes - Haha. That we can experience that ... What do you want, Tom? What have you prepared? - Today there is whatever is there: roast pork with potatoes and peas. (Laughter.) Listen. She is married. Act like this as if you went to school. Here if you are at night have to go to the bathroom. I have her worn only once. '74. You weren't born there. Good night. - Thank you. Have you been to her Where have you been? - It does not matter. Have you been to her - With whom? With my mother, of course. Without you I will don't go to her. Do you think she tells you everything? - What do you tell, Henry? Be glad she doesn't know yet that you're here. Where do you want to go - I want to meet Tom Faller. Tom? Do you want to question him about me? Don't believe him! Believe them all Nothing! They only tell lies! Why? Do you like him? Do you want to sleep with him Don't make yourself small, Henry. Why don't you want me anymore? Why can't you love me like me? We shouldn't have come here. Don't go again, please! Don't leave me alone again! What do you wish for What can i give you Say what do you want more than anything else in the world? More than anything else in the world? Be dead. And that we we would never have met. (Talk about playing cards.) How does it taste? Crappy. That pleases me. OK. Thanks anyways. No offense. If you snore again then you sleep outside. Good night. (Quite Music.) You are very close. But the Thalberg glassworks is on the other side. Do I look like that, as if I got lost I can take you there if you want to. I can do it for you also describe. Or I'll take you there. Whatever you want. Strange. - What? No one came from that direction for a long time. - Where from? From the Thalbergs. I think I better take you. (Growl.) This is leaked glass. Now it's hard as steel. So you notice it too. What? - That evil lives in this place. If you feel it, you have it necessary thin skin, tell people. Since then. Since it happened. What happened here? The old Thalberg was on fire the best glass in the Ore Mountains. Until the communists expropriated. After that grew Hatred and bitterness in him. At some point the mountain shook. Maybe it was a blast, there's dynamite never lacked here. The tunnels were spilled. Thalberg was up there with his son ... - With his son? Should I tell more? Yes, please. Thalberg stood upstairs with his Son and watched motionless. Berta Otth lost her brother and her husband. Her mother went to the mountain for days and let peas through the slits trickle. The echo echoed softly spilled shafts upwards. Half of the men stayed below. You are still down there. A bunch of old bones. Sometimes they come out sneak through the woods and howl. Huuuh! What happened to Thalberg and his son? One night Thalberg took his son and went through with it the Teufelsgrund ... The what? The Teufelsgrund is a gorge in which it always rains. They say the devil cools down there too his hot hut to the water. The trees breathe there at night their shadows and the goblins play hide and seek with them. What happened that night? - So. Do you know the story of ...? - What happened? There was an accident. father and son burned in the glassworks. Did you find the bodies? What the fire takes there is never again. Some say lightning struck through the roof of the glassworks. Almost everything was destroyed. Burned. Eleanor Thalberg has since never leave her house. (Rebecca gasps.) - Are you not well? Yes thank you it's fine again. That comes from quartz dust. No it is this ridiculous story from old Thalberg and Henry. - Henry, exactly. That was his name. This banal legend of wolves and forest fairies and curses. Do you believe this story? - This is how it is told here. They dodge. (Growl.) Rebecca! Here for you. Mountain boots. I hope they fit. Thank you. If this continues, I will be with this village left many new shoes. Tom, you are drinking now a coffee with us! I still have a lot to do. - Bring the devil whatever it is! How is your mother - The witch is sleeping. At this time? Mummy is like the joke of the man who goes to the doctor: "Doctor, I can't sleep! It works at night. Morning, afternoon and evening also, but not at noon. " They are married. Nobody cares here. - But. We are all interested in that. Yes. I am married. With who? With my husband. - Of course I meant, what is he doing? Is that your husband last night was in your room? There was no man in my room. We have asked enough now. I have to go. Rebecca, good luck with your husband, your book! Berta, thanks for the damn coffee. It was last night nobody in my room. It was last night nobody in my room. (Soft clicking) I am so happy for you. I saw you together. What are you talking about? - Make any plans, Ms. Faller? What are you talking about? He is like me. And so humble and fond of animals. He knows you're lying. A book on glass. How unimaginative of you my treasure. I've heard every word. What happened then? in the glassworks? Tom told you that the tunnel is spilled and that there is no entrance. But that's not true. Come along. (Exciting music. Thunderstorm.) My father kept going hunting with me at night. He knew I hated it. He cut up the game took it out and gave my heart to eat. Sometimes it twitched. Then I fled from him into this cave. He never found me here. Have no fear. These are just the old bones of the buried miners. Everything sleeps here forever and nobody wants to be woken up. Do you understand that? Let it rest. I want to get out of here. Stay here! The storm is approaching. You get soaking wet. (Growl.) Quiet. Why don't you let me go Because I love you. More than myself. Your way of loving is worse than my father's contempt. I know it's late. What do you want? - Do you know who I am? You are the husband. Why do you think that? We have had since last fall a lot of rain and two visitors: A woman yesterday. And today you. What does the woman want here? She is writing a book on glass. - nonsense! You know what happened then happened in the night! Okay, okay! Skirmish over. And who is she? Rebecca Thalberg. Oh shit. And who are you? I have until yesterday afternoon for the old Thalberg worked. A private sniffer. The old Thalberg has you scheduled for Rebecca. Why? She is afraid of her. You want the key to the solution? That would be great. Do you have him with you? Now I'm supposed to find the right door? Yes. What will I find behind it? I dont know. In any case, it will be Eleanor Thalberg break your neck. (groans) Rebecca Thalberg is not that what it claims to be. No man is who he claims to be. So, my friend. What did we learn? Feet belong under the table, yes? Tom! We need to talk. About what? About this. And? - He's back again. Henry Thalberg has returned. He is dead, Berta. - Oh no. I heard her speak to him. Her voice was the voice of a woman who loves. Do you know how it sounds Henry Thalberg and his father are burned. You know that's not true. What do you mean by that? Your father told you where the watch you wear comes from Henry's watch. You imagine something. I know what everyone knows here. Henry pushed his father in the oven and disappeared because someone helped him escape. And now he's back. It can be an uncomfortable end to take. Do you think the old Thalberg allows that this story came to light is coming? Do you think the? For real? (Dramatic music. Fireside fireside.) (It rings.) I would know, that you would come So that's how you look. Henry's great treasure. His everything. I have a long time thought about you all the years. (whispers) I know so much about you I have the feeling, To know you well. Tea? Gladly. Hey Freeze! Stands still! You should stop! (Wolf howl) You'd better be out the area disappear! the people have Afraid of you! Henry wished a pony as a little boy. His father bought him a horse. A very big horse. He put it up and of course little Henry fell down. From a height of 1.60 meters. Joseph put him up again and over and over again. Didn't he tell you that? No. Then you don't know so much about me. Have you been there? I was sitting up on the terrace. It took at least an hour. Henry was green and blue and bloody everywhere. He broke his hip and both legs. Then he was in bed for a year. Henry got me from those windows tells. He was afraid of them. This is made from Thalberg quartz poured. From my husband personally. He told Henry that is reflected in what you'd rather not see. Why tell me what a bad mother you were? That's why you're here, isn't it? Why don't you have one? of his letters answered? Why does he go out at night? - Will he come back? Always. Sometime. What happened nine years ago in the glassworks? In this night... In this night Henry freed himself. About what? Henry doesn't want that you know that so I don't want that either. Henry is here. Here? He is here? He wants to speak to you. All right, darling. Because it is you. Come both tomorrow for dinner in the evening and i will tell you if you want, tell everything. You will live together happy to the end of your days. That's what you want. - Yes. Now get out of here. Tommy, is that you? - Yes. You like it. I knew she was coming. She'll take everything leave nothing. Nothing! It will pull your skin off. - It won't be that bad. Do not you want to know, why did she come? She is your daughter-in-law. She comes with my son she said. I have both tomorrow invited to dinner. Do you want to come too? There are lobsters. Don't worry, he won't come. - How do you know? Because he's dead. He's been dead for a year. - That is not true. And whether that is true! I swear to you She is totally crazy. To which door does this key fit? You know it, don't you? What do you do? What you up to? Forget the key! There is no door for this key! She is crazy! - who is the guy who is snooping everywhere here? Did you give him the key? I do not know what you're talking about. - Who came out of your house yesterday. He should get her off my neck hold. It is evil. She wants to destroy me. - Why should she want to do that? Why does she want to destroy you? I think, you don't want to know Do you want to leave us? Good news is spreading apparently fast. Bad too. It doesn't fit in any door. Where did you get it from? I was with the body by Henry Thalberg. Anyway that what was left of her. The key hung around his neck. Did Rebecca kill him? - No. But she was there when he died. Here you can keep. I don't need the stuff anymore. Rebecca was on the balcony when it happened. He was down in the garden and is burned. He has to run himself on gasoline poured over. The only strange thing is that you couldn't find a canister. And Rebecca? Can you imagine, to watch helplessly like the person you love burns? She collapsed had delusions, came to the psychiatric ward. See you last week. It broke out. Then who is the man with whom she travels? Already in love? (Beat.) Yes? Good evening. Sorry for the disturbance. Tell me where can I find something to eat? The old inn has closed. The host closes on Mondays because his wife has migraines. I just wanted to what to eat. If you want ... - You're welcome. So if I don't bother? I where! Come in. You have it rustic here. Looks like inherited. Do you see that? What are you cooking like that? Uh ... pheasant. How do you come with Ahead of your research? I was with Eleanor Thalberg. Oh yes? And how was it? - She is a scary woman and so fearful at the same time. Do you know her? I mean, personally !? When do you know someone personally? How do you want your pheasant? Greasy, very greasy, unbearably greasy? Unbearable. Good choice. Is that your father in the photo? Yes. Georg Wilhelm Faller. (Music by Etta James: "At Last") Delicious. I wish, You would trust me. I trust them. Then tell me why you are here. I'm hungry. And on what? You are too fast, Mr. Forester. Sorry, I don't have much time. That's right. Not so much happens here. It is never that much happens in my life. Then come and ... huh. Suddenly everything is different and now ... And now has it happened? - Yes. Now it has happened. You are a wonderful man. I love this kitchen and your music. And I've never been like this ate a delicious pheasant. But you are married. Exactly. (Growl.) You are wearing Henry's watch. What does that mean? Yes I know. This is your husband's watch. You know all the time who I am. You are wearing Henry's watch. My father gave it to me. What do you and your father have? to do with my husband? Rebecca. And I thought... Rebecca, wait. - I never want to see you again! (Wolf howl) (in a distorted voice) Henry! Then she ran out the door. Father told me back then the day will come I have to return the watch. And it's only because of the watch came here? Nonsense about the legacy did she come because of the house and because of the country. - I do not think so. She came for something else. What should I do? You have to tell her. - What should he tell her? How stupid are you What you say to a woman. Whatever everyone says. Did you tell your women I love her. There you are. Go then. Great. Thank you guys. Where is she? Is she gone? - Isn't she upstairs? Nah. It's good, Berta. I can do that. (Wolf howl) (Quite Music.) How much I love you. Do you feel that I saw your mother I was with her. She told me about you. From the big horse. And I saw the window. The Thalberg quartz. Oh my darling. What is terrible happened to you in this place? Yes I know. It doesn't matter. I know you. tomorrow we will go to your mother. She will tell us everything. Then we become this leave terrible place and everything will change. - Yes, darling. Nothing will be like this as it used to be (Rhythmic music.) Good Morning. Nice to see you. You look fantastic. Good morning, woman ... Thalberg? Ms. Thalberg! What can we do for you? I need lobsters. Tonight, Tommy? Are you coming? Lobster was out, but I promise you, it will be nice anyway What do you want? - I would like to pay. I depart. - Nice? Did you get everything what they wanted? Not yet but soon. What do I owe you? I don't take any money from you. How may I understand that? There have been no wolves here for a long time more. Suddenly they are back. What do I have to do with that? - That's a good question. We do not tolerate intruders here. (She spits out.) (Mysterious music.) Hello, Rebecca. I love you. Maybe you are interested. I know. I love someone else and I never want to see you again I would like to explain something to you because of the clock. My father and Eleanor Thalberg were back then a secret couple of lovers. He told me on my deathbed when he gave me this watch. Here. Why are you giving it to me - my father said the day will come I have to return the watch. Give it back to your husband and go home with him. Nobody will find out anything from me. Tell him he has the most wonderful woman in the world. He is really to be envied. I don't believe a word. You lied to me. I trusted you. If you have a spark of honor then disappear and leave me alone. What happens then? If I disappeared tonight ... You want to know what's going on played back then? But the truth is too big for you! You don't have to me protect from the truth. We are long enough ran away from her. It's time, to look her in the eye even if behind it opens an abyss. - Then come! Where? - To the abyss! (Thunderstorm.) Why is it so hot here? Something is wrong with the glass. - My father found the watch here. Henry lost her here when he was pushed his father into the oven. Or the one he thought was his father! - What do you mean by that? My father found the remains from Joseph's body. In this oven. After that he put the fire everything like an accident to look like. Why did your father do this? - He did it for Eleanor and for Henry. Henry is his son and my half brother! And the old Thalberg always guessed. Your husband killed him here in this oven. Can you live with that? (Crash.) (Scream.) (Dramatic music.) Let's go home Favorite! Do you want to kill both of you? - There's an iron bar over there! Use them as crowbars! You see that there is none Has purpose. Let us drive. No! That can not be! - You know everything now. I killed him. No. I killed him and you know it. - Go out of the way! You have to get out of here. The spirit of the old Thalberg owns this glassworks. He will burn you just like he burned me. Are you okay? - We have to get out of here! (Dramatic music.) Rebecca, get down here! Rebecca, Rebecca! Calm down! Rebecca! It's over! No, it's not over yet! I can feel it! Please believe me! My mother will never forgive you! And you, Henry? Will you forgive me - No! (Sob.) - Calm down. I'm there. He can't hurt you anymore. There is no one. I know, that he is not there. He is dead. You know he's dead? - I'm not crazy. I just can't let him go. Not yet. We have to go to Eleanor. She's the only one, who knows everything. I'm here, my angel! If this glassworks was cursed and here the old Thalberg rules and if Henry really did him killed ... Why did the glass go ahead not trying to burn him in the lava? - We have to get out. How did you get in here? - No! First she tells me why they're so guilty and fear is! You stink of guilt. (Dull roar.) It was about time that everything goes down here, huh? He left me to live far too long. It was you, Is not it? You killed your husband. Henry came to me and said what he did. He had an argument with Joseph and then he pushed it into the oven. I ran to the glassworks. There was this monster on the ground. He had managed crawling out of the oven. It was just charred Meat, but he lived. I would know, he was going to kill Henry. Then I killed him. With a glass tub, with a hook, I do not remember. You murdered him and Henry believed that it was him. How could you do that to him? The heart is a dark forest my child. (Wolf howl) Tommy, don't! (Dark music.) (Growl.) (Scream.) (Silence.) (sobs) Here he tortured Henry. Oh God. What could he do that he wasn't his son? Here they come! What will you do now? I'll try, Matthes and the Otth to catch when trapping. You knew all the time that they are? There are things you know. And things you hope for. (Melancholy music.) Do you think of him The whole time. I like him. It suits you. Where are you going? You have to rest. The last Days were exhausting for you But don't worry: I'm there. Good.
