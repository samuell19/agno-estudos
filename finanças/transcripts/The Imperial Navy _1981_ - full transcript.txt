Toho Studios The sea once closed Japan, then opened it again. After centuries of isolation, Japan was quickly modernized during the Meiji and Taisho periods. It strengthened its military forces to cope with foreign powers. The Imperial Navy was thus born. Formed by the consequential state requirement. Having brilliant victories in the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, it entered the ranks of the finest fleets. Making Japan the world's third greatest maritime power. But then came the Showa period when the country resorted to the armed forces to resolve territorial policy desires. As Japan's appetite for conquest grew unchecked, there had to be an eventual reckoning referred to as "The Tragic Age" THE IMPERIAL NAVY September 1940 The world situation surrounding Japan at this time became more stressful day by day. The Navy Ministry participated in many discussions that autumn. The purpose of which was decide whether Japan should join a military alliance with Germany and Italy. Seventy separate meetings were held by five different cabinets with no decision reached. Then the Navy Ministry, which had always opposed such an alliance, suddenly agreed to join the Tripartite Pact. On that day, at a very high level meeting of the Navy Ministry, the fate of the Imperial Navy was sealed. Koshiro Oikawa, Minister of the Navy Isoroku Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet Yamamoto You said if we make a triple alliance with Germany and Italy America would stop supplying Japan steel and oil. However, no one can say whether it would lead directly to war or not. After all, this was also about improving Japanese-American relations. But if we continue to ignore the voice of the people then this could spill over into internal unrest. Considering all this, I have come to the current conclusion. I had no choice. I really could not do anything but to take this course. If possible, in consideration of the circumstances, please forgive me. You think to get off with an apology?! This is too important.

Hurrah! He did it! Hurrah! Hey, Masato! The Naval Academy is not an ordinary military school. So my dream for you that I have cherished for so long has come true. Masato, congratulations. I'm sure Mom will be very happy, too. Thank you! All ready. What is it? Why do I get one? Won't you get dressed to go? Where to? Mom... Why are you running? We gave father the news, and he ran faster than a bullet. Father, this came for you. "At 9am on September 15th you are to appear for service." I have been recalled to the Navy. Why do they call up old men like you? It seems odd. Old! Who are you calling an old man? This old man is different! Here, take a look. This summons includes an apology. They apologize for keeping me in the reserves, not considering my 18 years of faithful service. Please, if possible, come back they write. You really served 18 years in the Navy? Yes, I was promoted to Chief Petty Officer. But with graduates of military schools, everything is different. Rapid rise up the career ladder. Someone my age they might already be a Commander or even Captain. So brother will also become a ship captain? Masato, try to graduate with honors!

Spurred by Germany's successes, the Triple Alliance countries, now including Japan, forced the occupation of the southern parts of French Indochina. As a result, America toughened its attitude and imposed an embargo on oil exports to Japan. Osami Nagano, Chief of the Imperial Japanese Naval General Staff At current rates, our oil supplies will be gone in a year. Osami Nagano, Chief of the Imperial Japanese Naval General Staff Everything is happening as Yamamoto predicted. We can only hope on improving Japanese-American relations as a last hope to avoid war. Something made more difficult by war-mongers in the fleet. Who exactly? I'm talking about the commander of the First Air Fleet. You mean Nagumo? Almost completely ignorant on the capability and potential of naval aviation. He was appointed to that position largely due to his seniority. In peacetime, that might have been acceptable. But facing a war.... Still, you can't ignore Nagumo completely. In my opinion, a more suitable candidate would have been Ozawa. Jisaburo Ozawa, Commandant of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy Well, what is it you want to ask me? Jisaburo Ozawa, Commandant of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy Sir, we heard that you recommend that our aircraft carrier forces be organized into a single air fleet. We are expecting to be stationed on the aircraft carrier Zuikaku. But we have no idea when it will be commissioned into the fleet. Until then we must train on that old tub Hosho. Therefore, we beg you to speed up completion of the Zuikaku. - We beg you! - We beg you! Each of you has one more year left in your flight training? With so little experience and so much time remaining, is there any purpose in expediting construction? "Strengthening the personal decision that I am absolutely opposed to any war with the United States, is the diametrically opposed reality that just such a military conflict may be unavoidable. This has led to a very strange state of affairs. What will be the decree of fate?" Come in. I apologize for the intrusion. I received a message that you wanted to see me. You came at a opportune time. How so? I wanted your opinion about my dilemma. I came thinking you might be wanting to resign, retire. But I understand they won't let you. Moreover, they are going to make you pay for the sins of all those who agreed enter into a triple alliance. An air attack on Hawaii. How would you do it? How to do it? On Hawaii. With airplanes. In that year, the Imperial Fleet decided to form a new naval strategy where the main striking power was built around fast-moving aircraft carriers. The "Mobile Force". Aircraft carrier "Akagi" Chuichi Nagumo, Commander of the First Air Fleet With the new planes, Chuichi Nagumo, Commander of the First Air Fleet There is no doubt that naval aviation has become the star of the fleet. Ryunosuke Kusaka, Chief-of-Staff to Nagumo Yamamoto expects a lot from us. Maybe that's why he asks the impossible from us? But the most annoying to me is his Chief-of-Staff. Are you talking about Ugaki? He's a battleship admiral. He doesn’t care to understand anything about airplanes. Matome Ugaki, Chief-of-Staff of the Combined Fleet Admiral, I do not understand airplanes. However, sir, I am going to assist in any way possible with whatever you are planning. When you were Deputy Navy Minister, at the behest of fate, your advice was rejected in concluding the Triple Alliance pact. I wholeheartedly sympathized with you. Sept. 16, 1941 There was disagreement about the feasibility of the Hawaii Operation not only by the Navy General Staff but also by officers in the fleet. Naval War College On the basis of war games, Naval War College the problems encountered were presented to the Navy General Staff. It proved unusually difficult to achieve any consensus. Attacking Hawaii carries the twin challenges of unleashing a far-flung war immediately following destruction of the US Pacific Fleet in one decisive blow using the limited military resources we have. But only a lightning attack can guarantee such results. In my opinion, this is the only way for this plan to succeed. Seiichi Ito, Vice-Chief of the Navy General Staff I would like to express Seiichi Ito, Vice-Chief of the Navy General Staff the opinion of the General Staff. We understand the complexities and uncertainties of such a military operation. But as reasons against making such a surprise attack at Pearl Harbor, we would wanted to give the following: First. Refueling on the open ocean will be extremely problematic. Second. An unseen approach to the main US base for the Pacific Fleet will be close to impossible. Finally, and most importantly, there is still hope that our current diplomatic efforts will succeed. A sudden attack like this will make the United States unwilling to sue for peace making a protracted war, unfavorable to Japan, unavoidable. Having considered all arguments, we concluded that because of all these risks the attack on Pearl Harbor should not be undertaken. If you are so opposed, then do you have an alternative plan? Fukudome. You explain it. Should current negotiations fail, for Japan to survive we must first seize the oil and other resources we need from these southern areas. The US would consequently declare war and their Pacific Fleet, having an initial military advantage, will begin a long, slow advance, westward from Pearl Harbor moving through seas that we would then already control. We take the battle to them first by aircraft and submarine gradually reducing their combat power so that our battleships can destroy what's left of the enemy in one final decisive battle. This is the traditional concept of how Japan would win a Pacific war. Don't you think the shortcomings of that plan are already well-known. We can't rely on the short range of our battleship's guns to stop the US Pacific Fleet. Ugaki! Didn't you create that plan when you were on the General Staff? You recommended building 'Yamato' and 'Musashi'; the two largest battleships in the world! Now, I’m the Chief-of-Staff for Admiral Yamamoto. So now you renounce the use of battleship guns?! And still... it's just too risky. Unfortunately, the General Staff cannot approve an air attack on Pearl Harbor. What more can I say? What is the opinion of the Mobile Force? I am against this operation. Even so, the destruction of the Pacific Fleet in Hawaii in one blow is very tempting. But with the forces currently at our disposal, it's impossible. Our four aircraft carriers and their escorts would have to sail 3,500 miles in secrecy. Nothing like this has been done before. That's exactly why it will work. We are not here to hear the excuses why the Mobile Force cannot do this. Admiral Nagumo, the aircraft carrier Zuikaku is almost ready. Along with Shokaku, that would make six aircraft carriers in the Mobile Force and an additional 162 aircraft. That should be enough. What do you think? Would the General Staff reconsider if we used six aircraft carriers? No, we must strike south first! The General Staff decided! Moving through the south takes too long. If there is no way to avoid war, any hope for victory means we must attack Pearl Harbor. December 8, 1941 - Japan time (December 7 - Hawaii time) Understanding that war could no longer be avoided, the attack on Pearl Harbor had been debated at the highest levels. Admiral Nagano reluctantly ordered the attack saying "If Japan accepts the demands of the United States, Japan will perish" "If Japan fights the United States, Japan may perish." "We hope to solve our problems in diplomatic negotiations." "But unfortunately we must fight if we are commanded to wage war." Fate commanded war. Hawaii! Attack formation! Signal surprise attack successful! Now! Let's go! Steady ... Now! Steady ... Release! Commander, we did it! Surprise brought us success! Summarizing the results of our attack: Five enemy battleships sunk. Also four destroyers and more than a dozen other enemy ships either sunk or on fire. Altogether 300 aircraft destroyed. It seems we our results exceeded expectations. Yes! Fine! This is a good start! Admiral, the American Pacific Fleet has been destroyed! Why were there no aircraft carriers at Pearl Harbor? A few days ago, the Lexington and Enterprise were seen there. This attack was of no strategic value if we missed their aircraft carriers. From that day on, the rallying cry across America was: "Remember Pearl Harbor!" The next day, President Roosevelt asked for a declaration of war saying: "the Japanese government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace." The attack on Pearl Harbor had another result. It confirmed the superiority of airplanes over battleships. Something that would be proven again and again in the Pacific war. It also served notice that Japan was capable of building the enormous ships necessary to fight such a war. In particular, the formidable battleship "'Yamato'". Battleship "Yamato" Under construction in secret for five years, Yamato was a triumph of naval design and engineering. The largest battleship ever to sail the seas. Equipped with 18-inch guns and many technological innovations. Just look at her! She's a floating fortress. February 12, 1942 The Yamato officially becomes the flagship of the Imperial Navy. ♪ From all sides ♪ ♪ her empire is the sea ♪ ♪ And her brave guardian sailors ♪ So, what do you think? Did you build it yourself? Of course, who else? Wow... I feel like I've became the Commander-in-Chief. Admiral? Where should we attack next? Let me see... We've dealt with Hawaii so no need to go back there. The Philippines are ours. Java? Also ours. Sumatra and Malaya are ours too. All true. Rabaul occupied. Admiral, what is your decision? Admiral, what's next? Our Yamamoto must be struggling with this same question. Our plan was rejected. So the General Staff, as always, cares only for moving the war southward. As long as this thinking continues then the war will drag on. I dare not criticize the government publicly. But I’m responsible for the Imperial Navy and we need to end this war. If we delay, then America will soon show us their industrial and military might. End this war quickly. For that, we must invade Midway. April 18, 1942 American aircraft carrier "Hornet" April 18, 1942 launching sixteen land-based B-25 bombers, make a surprise air strike at Tokyo, Yokohama, Kobe and Nagoya. The Imperial General Staff, under fire, realizing the new dangers to the Japanese home islands, quickly approved 'Operation MI'; the invasion of Midway Island. So it seems that we must attack Midway now. In the past five months, we've sailed to the north Pacific, central Pacific, the Indian Ocean and the Coral Sea; over 50,000 miles. The same as if we had gone around the globe twice. Kusaka, Japan has been attacked. All that is beside the point. The aircraft carriers we missed at Pearl Harbor are what struck Tokyo. We must lure the American carriers to Midway. However, the carriers Zuikaku and Shokaku can't participate at Midway because of extensive damage they suffered at Coral Sea. You can blame the General Staff for squandering our resources. Just when we need everything we have. Four aircraft carriers can't get the job done? No, not at all. It's just that we rush from battle to battle based on the latest whims of the General Staff. I've had enough of their interference. However, we can kill two birds with one stone; destroy the American carriers, capture Midway, and the United States will sue for peace. May 28, 1942 Admiral Nagumo and the Mobile Force with four aircraft carriers sailed for Midway. Admiral Yamamoto followed 300 miles behind on the flagship Yamato with the main body of the Imperial Fleet. It was largest operation the Imperial Navy had ever undertaken; involving 200 ships and 100,000 men. Aboard the Yamato, a message was received from the General Staff noting increased American radio traffic indicating a possible naval force in the vicinity of Midway. Admiral Yamamoto believed this same report had been received by the Mobile Force. Oh, I'm sorry. This must be the wrong room. No, come on in. Pour us sake. Come in, come in. Here you are. What about our hostess? Is she coming? I'm sure she is. I'm sure all you sailors can spend a few minutes with me drinking sake before the big battle. What battle? The big one. Where? Midway, Midway... The whole fleet's there. Should be happening any day now. Midway... is where the whole fleet went to smash America. Already headed to Midway. You sailors take it easy. The geisha is dismissed! Things have certainly changed since Pearl Harbor. Before no one but the highest ranks knew anything about it. Look at it now! Even the geishas are chanting “Midway!, Midway!“. Maybe the Americans know, too. June 5th, 1942 The Mobile Force attacks Midway June 5th, 1942 in preparation for it's invasion before the American navy can come to it's defense. However, the United States had broken the Japanese naval codes and Midway was prepared for the attack. Consequently, the strike leader seeing that the Midway defenses were still intact radioed there was need for a second strike against Midway. Admiral, most of our scouts have reported in. No American carriers in the area. Alright, we attack Midway again! Admiral Nagumo decided to attack Midway by rearming his second strike group aircraft that had been loaded with torpedoes and armor-piercing bombs in case American ships were found. Their target was now Midway, not American warships. Bomb re-arming completed! Signal officer. Notify all carriers - standby to launch aircraft. Message from scout plane number four! Message from scout plane number four! Twelve enemy ships sighted including at least one aircraft carrier. Admiral, we have to send our aircraft to attack that carrier now! Land-attack bombs are almost useless against warships. They will at least make holes in the carrier's flight deck. But they won't sink them. We'll have to wait and re-arm our attack aircraft. Sir, what if the enemy carrier attacks us first? Signal from Hiryu. From: Captain Yamaguchi To: Admiral Nagumo Recommend we launch now! Recommend we launch now! I have the same opinion. Admiral, your decision? Admiral?! Admiral, I think we should attack the enemy aircraft carrier with torpedoes. Re-arm with torpedoes. Re-arm the second strike group for an attack on the enemy carrier. Stop loading land-attack bombs and go back to torpedoes. From torpedoes to bombs and back again from bombs to torpedoes. This delay and confusion caused by Admiral Nagumo was fatal to the Mobile Force. Air Group Commander, report to the bridge! Now! Five more minutes. Five more minutes and we'll be finished. Signal the other carriers - prepare to launch aircraft. Dive bombers! Enemy dive bombers! Right rudder! Port-side damage from bomb hit! Fire spreading! Was this the result of "Victory Disease" or just poor scouting? No matter which, it was the first defeat suffered by Japan since the outbreak of hostilities. This naval battle, resulting in the loss of four aircraft carriers, influenced all subsequent thinking of the Imperial Navy. This terrible tragedy was due to an inexcusable error in my operational planning of this operation. I beg you to accept my humble apology. I will never rid myself of the shame for what has happened. But if it is possible, I ask for ... Admiral,... I beg you to give me a chance take revenge on the enemy. I beg you! You can tell Nagano we will all keep fighting. Sit down. It has been said that our intelligence was lacking. How could you have been surprised after the message from the General Staff about a possible gathering of enemy warships. Did you receive such a message? No, we didn't. Why didn’t you tell us? Are you so in love with the Yamato's big guns that... Watch what you are saying! Of course, we thought that this information had reached you. It had not. The ships of the Mobile Force are all short-masted. Unlike this behemoth Yamato, we did not have any super-sensitive radios. We missed the enemy carriers in Hawaii and they were waiting for us at Midway. Could the enemy have broken our codes? That possibility cannot be excluded. But Admiral Yamamoto is a gambler. In a war, chance is always a factor. This time he gambled and lost. Where is the next action going to be? Any idea? The Pacific is a vast ocean. Until that time, few people had ever heard of Guadalcanal. In the months that followed, there was a series of pitched battles that took place in which both navies sustained heavy losses they could ill afford. October 26, 1942 In the battle of Santa Cruz, the Japanese aircraft carriers Shokaku and Zuiho were damaged and forced to retire. The aircraft carrier Zuikaku stayed behind and fought. Gentlemen. Today, you men of the Zuikaku may determine the outcome of the war. Some of you have already flown two missions today. But we have to ask you to fly against the enemy one more time. Having collected you from from the other carriers, I appoint Lieutenant Hongo as strike leader. You are responsible for seeing that everyone returns alive. Sir, how can we leave this carrier without a single fighter plane aboard? Do not worry about enemy attacks. Both of the enemy's aircraft carriers are already seriously damaged. Enemy planes, starboard. Enemy aircraft 30 degrees to port. Approaching fast! How is this possible? Our fighters are turning back. What? Enemy aircraft diving! Starboard helm! Starboard! Starboard! Here they come! They got him! Everyone quiet! Silence! Thanks to our fighters, we're saved. But what will happen to our strike planes? What will happen to them without any fighter escort? Kudo, hold on! Another 30 minutes. Don't fall asleep! Stay alive! Hold on! Run! Kudo, we made it! Careful of his eye. Hongo! Stupid bastard! Because you turned back, enemy fighters tore us to pieces! Only four planes returned because you disobeyed orders! You had to be some type of hero. I'll never forgive you. We were lucky not to lose the Shokaku. The Zuikaku was lucky too. If our fighters hadn’t returned, none of us would still be here. I'm going to see Mogi. Wait! Mogi isn't here any more. He's been transferred. He couldn't look you in the eye about turning back. A farmer I met just gave me that statue of Buddha. A friendly face, don't you think? Have some tea. I have a request to make of you. Please tell Yoko that the engagement is off. Tell her yourself. She's here. Now you know how she feels about marrying you. What did you think when you saw me in a wedding kimono? I was stunned. Reporting mission completed! "Dearest Yoko, I was ordered to return to base. They sent a car to pick me up. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you in person. Yours, Eiichi." "Japan is facing the greatest crisis in its history. In war, there are there who must die and there are those who must live. It is unfortunate that one of us must die. You must survive this war. Live that Japan may live. Learn that Japan may learn. Thank you, brother." Those who must die and those who must live. You should not salute me. I am a simple sailor with a rank lower than that of his son. But proud that he graduated from the naval academy. Father. I have been looking forward to the day when I could salute my son. Well, then? You have become a worthy son! Masato! Brother! Welcome home! I am glad to be back. Brother, congratulations! Thank you! Father? The honorary dagger bestowed by His Imperial Majesty. Let me see! Hands off! Masato, we're all proud of you. You graduated the top of your class. You'll be moving up the ranks quickly. It's wonderful when a child can make a parent's dreams come true. Sister, there's something I need you to know. What is it? I want to do what's best for my country but that might upset father. Wouldn't the top graduate be assigned to the best ship? I will be flying a plane. A plane? March 1943 Japan loses its tenuous hold on Guadalcanal March 1943 and evacuates the remaining troops. Imperial Fleet Headquarters was forced to redeploy from Truk to Rabaul. Admiral Ozawa was tasked with defending the new base in the face of increasing American sea and air power. Rabaul The narrow window Rabaul of opportunity for victory by Japan in the Pacific was rapidly closing. Soon, America was counter-attacking on all fronts. Only 15 months had passed since the war had begun. Yamamoto's prediction about Japan losing a long war was coming true and there was little he could do about it. How far to Rabaul? 180 miles. Let's land on Buin. Buin Where's the duty officer? Nomura, stay with the plane. Who's in charge? You were flying to Rabaul and need more fuel? We don't have any. Then get some. What ship are you from? The Zuikaku. The Zuikaku! Mogi? You're still alive. Forgive me. There isn't anything to forgive. I deserved that beating. But not them. Tagana, Ooe, Ueda, Kato, Miura, Okajima. I still remember the names of those who died that day. Where is Zuikaku? After leaving Rabaul, she was given a ferry mission. Want to see combat? Shit! Bastards! Where are the mechanics? Here. Fill up the fuel tanks of our guests, okay? Yes, sir. Good luck. That day, the plane that Mogi flew out on never returned. Commander, Third Fleet Admiral. Oh, it's you. You lost those fingers in the Battle of the Sea of Japan, didn't you? I was a young midshipman at the time. That was 38 years ago. 38 years ago. Look at where Japan is now. What went wrong? I understand you're leaving tomorrow on an inspection tour. To Balalae Island near Bougainville. We don't have air superiority there. It's not likely you'd be attacked but I'll see you get a large fighter escort. Absolutely not! Just think. The planes and ships I've had to send into battle with no support. With what result? All those men lost for no benefit. I'd be betraying them if I accepted your offer. But sir... My friend, you and I have been through a lot together. It can be very easy to start a war, but much harder to finish one. Someone will have to do it though. Why did he take such a unnecessary risk? All radio messages about his trip were coded. Sooner or later, all codes are broken. Throughout this war, Americans were decrypting Japan's radio messages. But the General Staff was unwilling to believe such a thing was possible. Their mistake lead from one tragedy to another. The death of Isoroku Yamamoto was the greatest. ♪ No matter how furious the wind blows and blows ♪ ♪ No matter how uplifting the grass, it is but dust ♪ "All student deferments have been eliminated. I passed my physical and so am now in the Imperial Navy, too. Brother, you talked about the difference between those who go to die and those who remain to live. Now, I go." Shinji. Father, what brings you here? Reading? You have three days leave. Mom is waiting for you at home. Father, do you remember Ranke? Are you talking about the German historian? Yes, you remember my high school teacher who was very thin because of tuberculosis. Once he said: "I've just re-read the full collected works of Ranke". "Each of you should do the same thing." He thought Ranke made excellent sense. That made quite an impression on me. I decided to read all the works of Ranke once I entered college. I've finished two of them. Halfway through the third. But there's no time left with the war. I'll return these. "Our youth is not over yet." "Our life is still going on." "Nothing is finished yet." As if awaiting the death of Admiral Yamamoto, a reborn United States Navy now advanced at lightning speed all across the Pacific towards Japan. The Kuriles, the Gilberts and the Marianas were retaken. The Philippines were now threatened. Japan had to make a stand. Admiral Soemu Toyoda, who succeeded Yamamoto as Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, and his Chief-of-Staff, Admiral Kusaka, called a conference aboard his new flagship, the cruiser Oyodo, anchored in Tokyo Bay, to discuss future strategies. The loss of the Marianas was the greatest defeat in the war with the almost complete destruction of Japanese naval aviation. The remaining garrison on Saipan, including their commander Admiral Nagumo, all committed suicide. We must devise a plan for our remaining warships, and our last large carrier, the Zuikaku, to stop this invasion of the Philippines. I propose sending all our battleships, including Yamato and Musashi, to bombard Saipan. That's nonsense! It couldn't possibly succeed. It's the only thing we can do with the ships we have left! Sept. 26, 1944 The Imperial General Staff decides to move into an underground bunker at one of the universities in Kanagawa Prefecture. Two weeks later, American forces made large-scale landings on Leyte in the Philippines. Following the 'Operation Victory' plan approved by the General Staff, Admiral Kurita's battleships Commander, First Mobile Fleet including the Yamato and Musashi Commander, First Mobile Fleet leave port at Brunei on October 22. Sail east through the San Bernardino Strait arriving near Suluan Island early on the 25th. The goal of this operation is to directly attack the American invasion forces in Leyte Gulf. However, there are reports that near San Bernardino, where Admiral Kurita will be, is the American Third Fleet commanded by Admiral Halsey. Halsey's fleet contains nearly 100 warships including 18 aircraft carriers Kurita's force will be destroyed unless we can draw Halsey away. I think I understand. Tell me exactly what you want the First Mobile Fleet to do. Your task is to divert Halsey's attention north so that Kurita can proceed through San Bernardino and attack the American transports and invasion beaches unopposed. Be a decoy? Correct. Deliberately allow ourselves to be attacked? Yes, exactly. How can this bring us victory? No, he's right. If Kurita's force can succeed in their attack at Leyte then this makes sense. Admiral, you agree? Kusaka, our meager carrier forces cannot bring victory. Kurita's fleet can. He must lead our ships into battle. But you are senior to Kurita in rank. I will not be with the ships attacking Leyte. Yes, but still ... Admiral, the First Mobile Fleet has taken a lot of punishment but we can still fight. There is no need execute a plan where we are merely a decoy. You want to risk our 15,000 men out of some misplaced pride and feelings of subordination? All that matters is that Kurita gets to Leyte. Kusaka, Ugaki. Tell Kurita that I accept the role of decoy in order to make this plan a success. Admiral Kurita and his staff met at Brunei in Borneo for a detailed review of the upcoming operation at Leyte. For the Leyte attack force, you'll need to select a flagship with the best armor and communications systems. May I suggest the Yamato? Commander, 2nd Fleet Chief of Staff, 2nd Fleet Takeo Kurita Tomiji Koyanagi Yamato? We prefer the cruiser Atago. Perhaps you could select one of the other battleships like Musashi. Yes, but... but we may suddenly stumble upon the enemy en route. In that case, we want a ship that is faster and more maneuverable. Flagship selection is an important decision Remember, the objective of this plan is the complete destruction of all enemy transports and ground forces on the Leyte beaches. You propose to risk our mightiest battleships simply to sink enemy transport ships!? You see, if we lose the Philippines, then we will be cut off from the resources of the South. Ships without any fuel are just piles of scrap iron. You don't have to tell me this! Please understand how important clear communications are to the success of this plan. Cruiser Atago or battleship Yamato? Which is your flagship? There is no need to change flagships. Fighter squadron 307 reporting for duty with 25 men at your disposal. Carry on. You will await further orders. Dismissed! Look at this size of this ship! Huge! So young. Kaizuka Takeo, Captain of Zuikaku More kids. Watch-keeping change in 5 minutes! Watch-keeping change in 5 minutes! Oct. 20, 1944 Ozawa's ships left the sea of Japan Oct. 20, 1944 and headed south toward Leyte. On board its four aircraft carriers, which included Zuikaku, were a total of 108 aircraft. There were 1,100 planes on Admiral Halsey's Third Fleet carriers. We're almost finished. Chief? Why were these planes craned aboard ship while we were in port? They've always been flown on before. These pilots aren't able to land on a carrier. They must be really lousy. By the way, here they are. Chief! What? We have never taken off from an aircraft carrier before. And still you feel so brazenly entitled to board this ship? But... But we will do our best for a successful take-off! You better! We don't need still wet behind the ears kids like you. But we sure as hell need all the planes we can get. It’s a waste to give these to you! Got it? Yes, sir. I can not hear you! Yes, sir! Okay. Anything else to say? Even if we can take off we certainly won’t be able to land. We will never return here no matter what. We will ram enemy ships. What? We will have to destroy the planes that you tend to with such care. We wanted to apologize. You came here... ...just to tell us this? Repair team, assemble! Can everyone hear? If any one of those pilots fails to take off, it won't be their fault but yours. I'm holding you responsible. Clear? Even if so much as one screw flies off the plane. Got it? Yes, sir! Why so quiet? Yes, sir! Okay, get back to work! Squirt, what's your name? Nihiso Chubachi. Chubachi, where are you from? Iwate Prefecture. From high school, transferred immediately to flight school. Did your father let you? Father died in the war. Mother lives alone. Listen... you must come back. You can make a mistake when landing but come back. No matter what happens. Thank you very much. Do not slouch! Friendly dive bomber approaching from the stern! Well trained. Want to know how to land on a carrier? Yes, sir. Watch carefully. Perfect! Just like that! Lieutenant Hongo, reporting for duty. Very well. Made it just in time. Anyone behind you? I am the only one. Lieutenant, we're glad to have you back. Shinji! Brother. Since when are you on Zuikaku? About a month. I heard you'd come back. Well... Have a seat. No, no time. I have to go on duty soon. We're going into battle tomorrow. There is something I've been wanting to ask you. Did you see Yoko? No. I was sent straight here from base. Just wasn't any time. Then I'm sorry for Yoko. Brother, why do you crave death? Shinji! Why... Do you know why you are here on Zuikaku? Why we're all here? I know why. To be a decoy. We're here to be sunk! I am leaving. I was retired from the Navy. Because you've got only one eye. So you knew. Why did you send for me? Why? It wasn't me. Well then who did? Who sent for me? The Imperial Navy! The Imperial Navy. ♪ And the flowers and the storm ♪ Hold it! ♪ I have overcome ♪ Don't you realize we were ordered to get ready for battle? This is how I get ready for battle. Screw off! You bastard, you're drunk! What does a kid like you know about battle? Idiot! Who do you think you are? I am a reserve officer. Bastard! Get up! You're a disgrace! As you were! Go on. Go on! Kudo, it's been a long time. Lieutenant! Your kid brother? I apologize. We've been in the Navy for three years. Now we're the old-timers, aren't we? Yes, veterans. I envy those who have gone before us. By the way, didn't you have a wife? She's back living with her parents. About a year after the wedding was when I got wounded. Things changed. Have another? And you? Me? I have a similar situation. Kudo? I've been side by side with you since Pearl Harbor. This time I don’t know whether any of us will return or not. I know. I count on you. Yes, together to the end! On schedule, Admiral Kurita’s fleet of battleships left Brunei heading northeast, past Palawan Island toward its rendezvous with destiny. Torpedo track starboard bow! Heading toward us! Atago...sunk! What?! By plane? Submarine. Kurita and his staff? They survived. Relocated to Yamato. The operation continues as planned. I will pass along the information upon receipt of details. Kurita's force has already been discovered. Our plan has not started well. Our current location is here. Kurita's force should be here. They should be entering San Bernardino strait about now. By the time they reach Leyte, we must lure Halsey north away from Kurita. They haven't moved toward us yet? Doesn't Halsey knows we're here by now? We've been broadcasting radio messages to attract his attention. Still nothing. Admiral, our scouts have located the enemy's invasion force. Will you order an attack? No, it's too early. Only after Halsey’s nose is definitely pointed in our direction. Admiral, radio message from our submarine patrol. Kurita's ships got through through the San Bernardino Strait and are now heading east along Samar Island. Halsey must have left the Strait! He took the bait. When do you think they'll hit us? It doesn't really make any difference. As long as he keeps moving away from Leyte. After making sure that Halsey’s fleet was following him north, Admiral Ozawa gave the order for all aircraft to take off. By the time you could make it back our carrier will probably be badly damaged. Therefore, I am ordering you to land at our airfields located in Philippines. Men, once there you will become land-based squadrons. Strike the enemy a decisive blow! That is all. Salute. Man aircraft! Admiral, we will be back! Let me in. Great engine! In wonderful condition. Everything alright? Chubachi! This amulet has protected me ever since Pearl Harbor. Thank you very much! I thank you. I thank you. Kudo? How is your mood? Extremely invigorated! Attack aircraft take-off! Take off one by one. Attack aircraft take-off! Take off one by one. Hats to the sky! Good luck! We are counting on you! Do you think he can handle it? I hope so. Look out! The amulet worked! That was close. The fool! Sir, this is for you from Lieutenant Hongo. There is something inside. Thanks. Mother! Kudo? Let's go! Bastards! The plan was gradually moving towards success. Halsey had no idea that he had been baited. Gathering all his strength, he struck at Ozawa's force. Carrier Chitose is sinking! Destroyer Shimotsuki immobilized. Helm reports direct hit. Helmsman losing rudder control. Helmsman! Answer! Helmsman! Answer! Helmsman! Answer! Sub-lieutenant Hongo at the helm! Right rudder! Right rudder! Right rudder! Starboard 20 degrees! Steady! Port side - torpedo planes! Sir, helm jammed! Helm jammed! Jammed. Port-side engine room flooded! Everyone dead! Any communication from Ozawa? Not yet. Sir, we were able to get through San Bernardino. We can safely assume that the decoy plan was successful. Ozawa must tell us that before we can begin our attack. Fire! Hold on! Stay on that plane! Fire! Fire! Die, you sons-of-bitches! Listing 20 degrees to port! Number four propeller shaft damaged! Fire in the third hangar! Sir, we've done it. We've decoyed Halsey. Signal officer, send this message to Toyoda and Kurita. "Decoy plan successfully completed" "Have lured enemy fleet north" Though the message was sent by Ozawa, for unknown reasons it did not get to Kurita. Kurita went to Leyte not knowing where Halsey was and wondering if he might find him at any moment. 50 more miles to Leyte Gulf. Admiral, it's a miracle that we've made it this far. Yesterday's air attacks by Halsey reduced our ships by half. All our remaining ships are damaged. We should turn around! Message from Southwest Fleet Headquarters. Read it. Enemy fleet located 113 miles north of Suluan Island. Time of message? 09:45 That's two hours ago. Admiral... By the time we got the message that Ozawa's fleet had successfully completed its decoy mission, two hours had already passed. Kurita should be at Leyte Gulf any minute. The way is clear for his attack! Send a message informing Kurita. However, this urgent report never reached Kurita. The enemy fleet, under the command of Halsey, is without a doubt very close by. The enemy is already using captured airfields in the Philippines. Here we are right in the middle. We could be attacked both from the sea and the land at any moment. Attacking transports in Leyte Gulf makes no sense now. I completely agree. We cannot attack the enemy transports with Halsey's fleet breathing down our necks. You're turning back? Yes, that's right. No! You must not hesitate! Admiral, everyone expects us to head for the Leyte Gulf. Ugaki, Ozawa's force failed in its task of decoy. Proof of this is the fact that Halsey is chasing us from behind. Even so, our mission is to attack transports in Leyte Gulf. Signal course 330 degrees. Admiral! Signal course 330 degrees. Admiral! Signal course 330 degrees. However, the enemy they thought was heading toward them was a ghost. The report received from Southwest Fleet Headquarters was false. Who sent that message? From where? To this day, this question remains an unsolved mystery. Due to Admiral Kurita's failure to follow orders, Japan missed any chance of stopping the Leyte landings. Meanwhile, on the Zuikaku which had played the role of decoy... We're ready to transfer the men to the cruiser Oyodo. Inform Admiral Ozawa. I'll stay. The boat from the Oyodo has arrived. Hurry up, sir! I refuse. Admiral! All of you leave! Get out! I ... I will stay with Captain Kaizuka ... I stay here. All hands, abandon ship. Hurry up, sir. Abandon ship. Hold on! Take me with you, please! Let go of me. I beg you! I beg you! Here... Zuikaku is sinking! I am a reporter for the Nara News. Could you share with our readers the sorrow of the loss of your two sons. Thank all of you for coming. By giving his two sons to the country you must feel truly honored. Well, I will do my best to see that a respectful article is written. We're finished I think. We depart tomorrow. Yes, it is such an honor. For the glory of the country. Cry. Cry for our sons. I have returned. Shinji! Mother! Shinji! Shinji! Shinji, he ... I... ...went with the ship to the bottom. At that moment when I started to lose consciousness, my body suddenly got lighter and rose to the surface. I survived only because of the life-vest that brother gave me. He sacrificed himself. He died in my place. Brother left me this message. "Shinji, I left Yoko still blooming." "Please, take care of Yoko." "Eiichi" It was seven hours before I was rescued. Fighting the waves of the Philippine Sea, I thought about just one thing. I must stay alive! For the sake of my brother. And for your sake. I want to fulfill my brother's last wish. I won’t ask you to answer me right away. I must report back to headquarters now. By New Year, I should have been dismissed. Give me an answer then. I'll be waiting for you at the Itsukushima Shrine, where you went with my brother on your honeymoon. Until then. "Notice. Ensign Shinji Hongo" "By January 10, you are commanded to report to the battleship Yamato for service." I'm sorry that I made you torture yourself. I beg you that... you forget what I asked of you then. I will have to go to sea again. I will leave you to live alone in peace. Who do you think I am? Some doll that you men can just leave at your discretion? No, I refuse to be a doll. Yoko. Marry me! Here and now! I promise you. I'll be back! I'll come back alive! ♪ In the beginning of the year, what will begin? ♪ ♪ I will proclaim its end so that ♪ ♪ the new year will be better ♪ Masato! Masato! What, father? Sit down. Masato, did you ... Did you sign up for special attack? Did you? Tell me! Well, come on. I did. So, after everything... You fool. Who volunteers to die before their parents? Miyo, what happened? Brother... Brother joined the special attack squadron. Brother? Wait! Never, in all my years in the Navy, have I ordered anyone to die. You can have a brilliant career... Stop it, please. Now there is a war. I understand that! No, you don't understand. All of Japan is about to become a battlefield. Sisters and mother. Where can they go to escape the flames of war? We are fighting in order to protect them. Are we not, father? I'm the dumbest father in the world. In my desire to see you an officer, I have shortened the life of... my own son. Salute! Ensign Hongo and four more men reporting for duty on battleship Yamato. Kosaku Ariga, Captain of Yamato Welcome aboard. Kosaku Ariga, Captain of Yamato Kosaku Ariga, Captain of Yamato Carry on! Hongo, go see him. Be back in 30 minutes. Are you in charge here? Which ship do you belong to? Battleship Yamato. Reserve Ensign? I see. We haven't seen action yet like you. But the nation calls us the same as you. After participating in battle, there will no longer be differences between reserve and permanent officers. Sorry. I didn’t mean anything by that. Sub-lieutenant Odagiri. Ensign Hongo. As as favor, I was asked to speak to someone on the Yamato. But it seems better to ask you. I must ask you to do it. Hey, Yamashita! Take this away. Throw it out? Why? We all like it. Just get rid of it. Anyway, I already... Are you Chief Odagiri? Ensign Hongo. I met your son, Sub-lieutenant Odagiri, by chance on the pier just now. We only talked for ten minutes, but I felt we were very close in spirit. Oh, really? Officer to officer, he told me that every man aboard knows about the Yamato you built. So I came to say hello to the owner of the Yamato. I am honored. I'd like to come back and visit more. April 1st, 1945 US forces attack and April 1st, 1945 invade the island of Okinawa. Over 300 warships plus 1,000 cargo ships and landing craft. More than 450,000 soldiers and Marines less than 350 miles from Japan. Imperial Navy Headquarters We would like to use certain units of of the fleet in a special naval operation. Vice Chief, Navy General Headquarters Which ones? Vice Chief, Navy General Headquarters On April 6, Kanoya air base’s 5th Detachment will undertake Operation Floating Chrysanthemum. Attacks by several hundred suicide aircraft against Okinawa flying from various bases which will, without doubt, plunge the enemy's ranks into chaos. Using this advantage, the next day, April 7, the Second Fleet detachment, built around Yamato, will sail to Okinawa. Impossible! We don’t even have the fuel to to fill Yamato's tanks. There would only need to be enough fuel for one-way. What? Everyone in this special attack would be volunteers sacrificing their lives. This plan is filled with determination and valor. But how can you call this a plan if it's not possible? How can you justify this sacrifice given the outcome in October at Leyte? This time, the outcome is unimportant. We just need to get Yamato into the battle. Yamato both in name and in spirit is a symbol of Japan! What will the people say if we lose the war but still have Yamato? The Imperial Navy must prove our fighting spirit remains unshakable! I beg you, do not disgrace Yamato! I do not want to listen to these petty arguments! I find it shameful to allow such senseless, offensive talk about the Navy's preservation of prestige. I disagree. Those are just my personal feelings. The matter must be decided by the Commander-in-Chief. What? A suicide mission by the Yamato? That is so. But there's something I need you to take care of in regard to the Yamato. To discuss such a delicate matter, I am sending a member of the Imperial Navy Staff. Kanoya air base What is this about? Commander, Fifth Air Fleet In order to implement this plan Commander, Fifth Air Fleet General Staff Headquarters asks that you do not provide any fighter escorts when the Yamato sails. No fighter escorts? You must undertake large-scale special attacks the day before. There can be no escort fighters remaining after that. How can such an order be given? The Yamato needs protection. We'll hold back some fighters for that. Tell that to the Imperial Navy Staff. I'm going to the Yamato. To persuade them? A suicide plan that you don't believe in is difficult to convey as an order. I know exactly how you feel. Special attack missions fly out from this base every day. "Go die!" It exceeds the boundaries of any proper order. However, as long as the war continues, I must give those orders. "Go Die!" Admiral... You and I have a lot in common. There is almost nothing left to command any more. Only to command the death of the Imperial Navy. Gentlemen... You have just heard from the Chief-of-Staff, the details of their attack plan. Let us now listen to the frank opinions of all gathered. Matsumoto, Head of Naval Secret Intelligence. It is without any doubt a plan that only true fools would agree to implement. Strongly against it! Yoshida, commander 41st destroyer division. We are not afraid of death. But this won't bring us any closer to victory in this war. Kotaki, commander 21st destroyer division. The Imperial Navy General Staff Headquarters is underground. What but utter blindness explains such useless plans? I would like to ask them to get out of their hole and finally face reality. Shintani, commanding 17th destroyer division. It's dying for nothing. What we ask for is a chance to fight the enemy and save our homeland! Idiots! Commander, Second Fleet Admiral. There are 3,000 men on the Yamato alone. Including the other ships of the Second Fleet, I hold 6,000 lives in my hands. I do not want even one of my men to die an unnecessary death. I was once a member of the General Staff. I know how plans are made that cause many men's deaths. I understand the pain that comes from giving such orders. However, in considering this order, let me ask you this. Was this approved by the Imperial General Staff? The Imperial Navy General Staff, the Navy Minister and the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet? All of them completely agreed with this plan? They all agreed. Admiral, we go to Okinawa! We go to Okinawa! We go! To Okinawa! Admiral, we go! We must go. "This may be the last time I can write you. I want you to grow up to be good women like your Mother. This is my last instruction. Take care of yourselves. 5th of April. From Dad." Including Headquarters personnel total men aboard the Yamato is 3,332. Have the cadets all left the ship? Yes, sir. 67 altogether. They didn't want to leave. You finally got what you wanted. It's for the best. They were only here three days. I would have like them to have sailed with us into battle. No, Ariga. That wouldn't be right. They must stay alive for the future of Japan There is no need to kill them. Distribute sake to all divisions. Open the ship’s store. The enemy already knows that Yamato will attack. Why is that? A reconnaissance plane recently flew over. As soon as we pass the Bungo Strait, an enemy submarine will sink us. That's what happened to Shinano. - Enough of this talk. - Let's brighten up the last days of the Imperial Navy Right! Stop talking and thinking on empty stomachs. We fight according to the operational plan. This is the only thing we can do. That is the best way for an Imperial Navy sailor to die. Let's drink! And sing! ♪ Hey, give us ♪ ♪ good weather! Hey! ♪ ♪ Tomorrow give us a clear day! ♪ For me, all is not lost yet. I have a father, a mother and Yoko, my wife. I fight for the ones I love. As long as there is love and people ready to sacrifice, our people cannot be destroyed! Therefore, our death and the death of Yamato can never be meaningless. We will not die in vain. You are born alone and you die alone. You leave alone and come alone. The path for us all leads only to hell. Speak for yourself. Hey, saint, your university philosophies do not suit us here. Well, are you ready? The same as you. Ensign Hongo, a drink? Yes, with pleasure. Did he put your soul at ease? Sub-lieutenant Kuroda? With pleasure. Enough, thanks. Not a time to be shy. If I drink too much, I might see double. Good, I don't mind as long as you fight twice as hard. Let's sing! All of you with sakura on the collars! Sing! ♪ You and me, my friend, are ♪ ♪ two cherry blossoms. ♪ ♪ In the garden called Yamato, ♪ ♪ we bloom. ♪ ♪ Since we are flowers, ♪ ♪ we are destined to fall. ♪ ♪ So let us fall magnificently. ♪ ♪ In the name of the country! ♪ Yoko... Before sunset on April 7, notification of my death will reach you. Soon, our sakura must fall. Please, don't cry for me in the coming spring. When my time comes, I will say goodbye looking at your smile. Soon, the Yamato will be underway. Is there nothing else left? Yesterday, when His Majesty granted me an audience on the matter concerning the general direction of the war. I said that from this moment on all that is left to us is suicide attacks by planes. His Majesty asked if that meant the fleet no longer has any ships. With the greatest trepidation, I replied that the Navy has mobilized all its reserve forces. I had no choice but to send Yamato into battle. Minister... Before the war began and the question was about the Triple Alliance, you that said there was nothing else to do. It all started with "I had no choice". It all ends with "I had no choice". On April 6, 1945, battleship Yamato and nine other ships departed Tokuyama heading to Okinawa through the Bungo Strait. For Yamato, there was to be absolutely no air support. That is inexcusable. So I am sending fighter escorts by my own authority. It will be a very difficult mission so I'm asking for volunteers. Departure tomorrow morning at 04:30. However, there is one other thing I must ask. Everyone to return to base at 10:00. Sir. Take us too! Your unit? Special attack squadron "Heavenly Sword". Aren't you attacking Okinawa? Not until the afternoon. We can fulfill your order and still fly our special attack mission. Commander! Please grant this request on what will be our last day in this war. That day, Admiral Ugaki waved a final goodbye as the Okinawa suicide mission took off. On August 15th, he would die leading the last suicide mission of the war. After passing the Osumi Strait, the Yamato turned south toward Okinawa. But it was known that Yamato was already being tracked from intercepted radio messages sent by American submarines. Friendly aircraft approaching from the rear! Bridge, tell Chief Odagiri it is urgent that he report to the main deck! On the double! All is well ... All is well ... Come back alive! I beg you, come back alive! Message from Tokunoshima radar: A large concentration of enemy aircraft, estimated to be over 200, approaching Yamato from the northeast. Tell them to continue reporting.
