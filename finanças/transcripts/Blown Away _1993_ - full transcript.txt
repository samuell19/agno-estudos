Look. Yeah. Huh? Dad, she said she'd be home by now. Shouldn't we wait? You know your mom, hmm? Go ahead, honey. Make a wish! Ho, ho, ho. Hey, sphincter. Rody here. What's up, Rich? Hey, rody, I'm not talking to you. I'm looking for my brother. Yo, Wes. Come in, Wes. Yeah, I read you loud and clear, shithead. What can I do you for? Pretty late night last night. I was just making sure you decided to get up this morning. You kidding? I'm working up a sweat already. - Wes out. - Wes, hi. - How are you? - Oh, Ashley. How are you? Good. Yeah, sure. Dick-breath. Dick-breath, come in. Do you copy...? Well, I'll probably see you next year. I had a great time this year. See you next year this time. Be a good thing. No, I'm just gonna go down and make sure the lift's properly closed for the season. Do me a favor. Try to get some work done today, will ya? Hey...you ok? - Yeah. - Yeah? Pretty dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. I guess he doesn't like me very much. No, I just think it's that he doesn't trust you. Smart horse. How you gonna get home? I'm gonna walk. Why? You got a better way? Come on. Thanks. I haven't seen you around here before. Yeah, well, I just got back from school. Listen, there's this party tonight. Sweet 16? Does this look like the body of a 16-year-old? I have plans. Well, change 'em. Here's the address. Whose place is this? Who cares? - Hi. - Hi. Am I gonna see you tonight? I have plans with the guys tonight. You know, it's-- it's been 3 days. - I'll try, ok? - Yeah. So, anyway, I mean, I was looking at her, and it's like she's got a great mind and everything, but her body's not evenly proportioned. Who? What girl has a mind? You know what? You're gonna have your own room once you make activity head like me. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well, you can keep your position. Ok, shithead? Thank you. Hey, guys, is it just me, or is it a pretty lame crowd in here since the resort closed down? Yeah, it's pretty awful, so I think we should probably ditch this place and find some women. Party. Oh, really? Me, too. That's sick. Oh, that's 3. Come on. What's up with you? Come on. Close this party. What's up? It's on my back. Oh, you let a chick write on your back? - What are you, nuts? Are you crazy? - Whipped. Whipped. You know, this is at the Bauer mansion. Oh, really? That's the guy that owns the joint. But you know what? I heard this guy's a real hard-ass. Yeah? Well, I don't care what kind of an ass he is, all right? I mean, his daughter is supposed to be beautiful, and I want to find out about it. Oh, well, then, she's mine. No, obviously, she would come to me. We're staying away from the same girls tonight. Yeah, yeah. Last time you almost killed each other, remember? Mercedes, 10 points. Oh! A little bridge action happening. Very nice with the Porsche going on. It's good. Good. Like this. Like this. This is nice. Hi, ladies. Oh, hello. Jackpot. - What's up? - Wow. Look at this. I'm in Hawaii. I got leI'd already. This is good. - Me, too. - Yeow! Buddy? Party! All right! Hey. Oh, my god. Wait a minute, man. I thought she wrote the address on your back? I hope she didn't use a ballpoint. It's a good thing it was a very short address. Hello. Hello, ladies. Oh, my god. God! Would you look at this? This is insane. Wow. There are so many women here. We must go downstairs right now and find them.

What was the worst day of your life? That's kind of a morbid question after great sex, isn't it? Well, it's only morbid if someone died. And that wasn't great sex. Thanks. Don't worry. It was good, but... Great sex is when you love someone so much it's like you're addicted to the strongest drug in the world. - You've had that kind of sex before? - Maybe. So who died? My dog. What's so funny? That was the worst day of your life? Your dog died? Wes my brother killed him. Why? It's a long story. I'm listening. I was 11, and he was 13. He was angry at my dad. I don't think he meant to kill the dog. It's just, he kept kicking him and kicking him. What did your dad do to Wes? He beat the hell out of him. My mom died last year on my birthday. Her car veered off the road and exploded. My father says she was drunk. - Oh, what time is it? - Why? Shit! My father's home! - Your father? - Yes, this is my house. - Mr. Bauer's your father? - Yes, he cannot catch you here. Shit. How old are you? I'm almost 18. When? In a couple years? What? Ok, well, I noticed you didn't ask me this before you fucked me. Look... My dad's just a little uptight, ok? - Ok. - Hello. Oh, shit. He cannot find you in his bed. Megan! I'll stall him. You hide, ok? Hi. Party last night? Yeah, it was ok. Thought you weren't gonna be back till later. I settled the deal last night. Where you going? My room. I haven't slept. Megan! Can you come here a second? Why is my bed unmade? Well, I slept in it. Why'd you sleep in my bed? Well, Amanda was over, and she slept in my bed. She left. Don't lie to me, Megan! Why don't you call her? You know... I would have killed him, whoever he was. As for you... What am I gonna do with you? Leave me alone. You going my way? Have you ever just wanted to kill somebody? Hey, I know how you feel. No, I mean really kill them. - Yes. - Who? My dad. But you didn't. Of course I didn't. Hey, Darla, about last night-- Fuck you, ok? Fuck me. Ok. You know she's 17, don't you? I had no idea. When I saw her, my brain went south. You gonna see her again? Don't know. And it's none of your business. 17's a warped age. They screw like bunnies... But, uh...She'll mess with your mind, man. Philosophy from a guy who'd screw a snake if someone held its head. Screwing and infatuation are worlds apart, Rich. The one I'm warning you about is the most dangerous brain disease known to man, but, then again, I guess we don't have to worry, because you don't have a brain, and you're certainly not a real man. Play ball, man. Hi. Who are you, and why do I care? Hi, this is Rich. Uh, Megan, I really wanna see you. Call me back, ok? 555-9225 Good-bye. Hey! Hey Is there something I can do for you? Are you still mad at me 'cause of the other night? Hey. Mad as in angry, you mean? Yeah, as in angry. No. I'm past that. Now it's more like disgusted. Don't you think we should talk about this? I don't know, Rich. Lately, every time I see your face, I just want to throw up... all over it. Oh. Rich, it definitely looks like you have a visitor. Hi. Don't you return phone calls? Well, I'm here, aren't I? What, did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed this morning? Yeah. I'm sorry. Apology accepted. Wow. Do you know the heimlich maneuver, by any chance? Because if they keep doing that with their tongues, one of them is definitely gonna choke. Don't leave. I'm popping a chubby here. I'm sorry. I should've called you back. Can I make it up to you? What'd you have in mind? How about a ride? No, really, drive. Is your dad home? No, I killed him. I'm kidding. Megan. Hey, Megan. Hey, Megan. Megan. Megan!

'Cause you did a wonderful job this year, really, I mean... out of all the people I saw on the staff I have to say that-- Wes, I gotta talk to you, man. I'm busy right now. Excuse us. Wes and his amazing penis will be right back. Are you nuts?! Are you kidding, Rich? You're gonna owe me big time for that. Use your Jeep? - No. - Come on, bro. No! No, no, no! All right, my room for your Jeep. What do you say? Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Mr. Bauer. Do I know you? I'm Rich Gardner, sir. I'm a friend of Megan's. Really? Friend of Megan's, eh? Is Megan expecting you? No, she's not. I was just dropping by. She's inside. Megan! You have company. - Hi. - Hi. I was in the neighborhood. Sorry I haven't called you back lately, but I've been really busy. I'm gonna clean up. 15 minutes, ok? Ok, daddy. - I think I missed you. - Oh, you think? Oh, I know I did. I didn't know it before I saw you, but I did. How come you left me here the other day? Oh, I'm sorry. I just-- I woke up that morning, and I had to be away from you. I suddenly felt so close to you, it scared me. Oh, well, you could try talking to me about it next time, ok? Yeah, well, talking's not my best sport. How did you and my daughter meet? Daddy, please don't embarrass me. Only trying to make conversation, honey. Wouldn't want me to be rude, would you? Thank you. He works for you. No kidding. Yes, sir. I'm the activity head at your resort. That's why he looks so familiar. It's an investment. Don't get to spend much time there. I assume you're doing a good job. Yes, sir, I am. Trying to save up enough money to go to college. The pay isn't that good-- yeah, but the fringe benefits are pretty good, though, aren't they? Yes, sir, they are. They include my daughter? - Dad! - Sir? I'm only kidding, honey. Rich knew I was joking, didn't you? Absolutely. Is everything all right? Oh, yeah. This is really good. You always hated eggplant. Oh, yeah? Well, not tonight. Whew. It's really hot in here. Could I have some more wine, please? Half a glass, young lady. Her mom couldn't handle alcohol either. What's wrong? Nothing. Are you sure you're all right? Why don't you excuse yourself? Stay right here. Finish your meal. She'll be back in a few minutes. Let me ask you something, Rich. Is it still just flirting under the table, or are you fucking my daughter? Sir? I'd like to make something very clear before we continue this bullshit banter here. I love my daughter... More than anything in the world. She's all I have. You hurt her, I'll choke you to death with your own intestines. Got that? Yes, sir. Excellent. - More wine? - Yes, please. - Hi. - Hi. I had a good time last night. Yeah, well, I can't see you anymore. Look, I have to go. Wait, wait, wait. What's wrong? You wouldn't understand. Wait a second. Megan, what is it? It's just me, ok? Would you please leave me alone? Girl problems? They're crazy, man. All of 'em. They're nuts. You know, Rich... Maybe it's you. You're fucking her, right? Yeah. Is she screaming on a regular basis? Wes, it's not about that. Girls--girls are always pissed off guys don't want to commit. I wanna commit. She won't let me. Does she know how you feel? She won't stick around long enough to find out. But she keeps coming back, right? Yeah. Well... Then it's either one of 2 things: She wants you to fight for her, or she keeps hoping that sex will get better. Wes, it's fucking epic sex, man. Well... You never really do know, do you? I mean, with guys... It's simple. There it is, or there it isn't. With girls... Maybe yes, maybe no. Wes, are you trying to make me feel better or worse? I think, really, all I'm saying to you, Rich, is... Maybe you haven't found the right girl yet... Or if you have, you don't know a good thing when you got it. Hi, Wes. Rich, you look like shit. Hey, Darla. Don't do this to me, ok? Darla... I'm sorry, ok? I'm sorry about the way everything turned out. Everything. She dumped you, didn't she? It's not that. Then what is it? Just tell me what you want, ok? That's the problem. I don't know. Why don't you do me a favor? Let me know when you do, ok? Ok. You know, she really does care about you. So why do I keep kicking her when she's down? I don't know. But this is about Megan, right? Yeah. Well... Go get her. Hey. Hi. Are we cool?

You don't know anything, do you? You know, Megan, I thought I met this girl. I thought we had something special. I thought maybe we fell in love with each other. It turns out she's not the person I thought she was. I'm afraid. Thank god. At least it means you care. Of course I care. I wanted you to love me. I just didn't think you would. Megan, what, was this all a test? No... Not at first. Then... You know, when I saw you following me... And you just wanted to see how far I would go. Is that it? Right? I guess i'm really fucked up, huh? It's not that, Megan. It's just I wish you would try talking to me. I will. I'm sorry. - Can I have a hug? - No. I'm so glad you didn't just leave. I couldn't do that to you. Megan... I would do anything for you. If I fucking hold it another second, I'm going to explode. I'm sorry, man. Come on. Hey, haven't seen you in a while. Megan, this is Dave. This is rody. This is Wes, my older brother. Can I see some I.D., miss? Go ahead. Have a seat. Whoa. Look at that. There's no chair here for you. I'll be back. So... What do you do when you're not hanging out here? Are you kidding? We live here. Excuse me. Can I borrow this chair? Hi. So, uh, I guess you figured out what you wanted, huh? She's not what you think. How do you know what I think? Well, I don't. Why don't you tell me what you think? I didn't know my opinion mattered that much. Of course your opinion matters. What do you think? She's a slut, and you're fucking her father's bankbook. Are you gonna stay mad at me forever? Probably. We're actually only half-brothers. My dad left when we were very young. Oh, yeah? And which is the better half? Well, it all depends on what you want us for, now, doesn't it? What do you do? Well... I'm pretty good at spending other people's money. Oh, yeah? Then I'd guess we'd make a great team, wouldn't we? I think we should go. Wait. What? We just got here. - Well, I want to go. - Duty calls. - Good-bye. - See ya. Hey, how's my Jeep? It's well-used. How's my room? You said it. What's wrong? Wes made a pass at me. I didn't know what to do. He ran his hand down my leg. I'm gonna fucking kill him. You'd really do that for me? Bye, Megan. Dad! I left my purse in his car last night. I just came to drop it off, sir. Mm-hmm. I'd like a word with you, Megan, when you're done. Nice seeing you, Rich. You, too, sir. You better go. You sure? Ok. If you need me, call me, ok? You know, Megan, you're turning into the same lying slut your mother was. How can you say that about her? - I mean, how can you say that about me? - Shut up! You're only 17 years old, and you're going to do exactly what I want to do in my house! - Why don't you go to hell? Don't talk to me like that! Jesus Christ! Rich. What's up? Couldn't keep your fucking hands off her? Huh? Take a shower. Fuck off. Not Darla, I'm talking about Megan. I don't know what you're talk-- come on! - Come on! - Come on, man! Come on--uhh! Huh? Huh? One more for you! Come on! Come on! Wes! - Come on! One more! - Stop it! Stop fight-- - Fuck you! - You don't own me. You don't own me, Rich! You can't keep doing this to me, ok? It looks like you're the real slut around here. He's not a good morning person. Are you ok? Yeah. It runs in the family. Wes. Hey. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Man, a lot of stuff's been going on lately. I'm sorry. I had no right to take it out on you. It's all right. It's been a while since we went a few rounds. Look, sorry I didn't tell you sooner. With you, I should've known. You know, it's not some quick thing. I think I'm really starting to like her. We'll see. Listen... I never laid a hand on Megan. Forget it. I told you she'd mess with your mind. It's not her, man. It's her dad. - Yeah. Is Megan's father here? - No. Excuse me. - Megan. - Go away. Hey, what's wrong? Hey. Hey. Holy shit. He knew I was here last night? Yeah, he knew you were here... And my car got stolen. It's just everything. Damn it. I've only seen him this angry a couple of times. He's just gonna say it was all an accident and talk about how clumsy I am. I wanna kill him. We should kill him. Rich, we could have everything. Wes...stop it. What is it, honey? Please. - Please. - What? What's wrong? I just... I need to tell him how I feel. And how's that? I don't wanna hurt you. It's--it's just that... I thought you were using me. I wasn't, though. You see... There's nothing... That you can do... To ever get him back. Nothing you can say... Or do... Will ever make him choose you. Nothing. Come here. Come on. It's ok, boy. Come on. Come on. I should've gone with her. She was really freaked out. I should've gone with her. Wes, this isn't your fault, you know? I know you're not gonna believe me, Rich, but for the first time in my life, I was really starting to care about someone. She didn't want me. She was using me to get to you. She loved you. Well, she deserves better than me. Hi. I'm... Detective Anderson, homicide. I'm sorry about your friend. I understand you were all very close. Homicide? Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. It's obviously a terrible accident. She was a good rider. Seems that the... Strap broke off her saddle. I guess that would throw anybody, wouldn't it? I guess so. Have you fellas been in a fight recently? What do you mean? Your faces. It's nothing. Same team or... Sibling rivalry? Dad always liked him the best. Excuse me. Could you tell me where the Bauers are? - He's in the waiting room. - Thanks. She swallowed the whole bottle. The doctor says she was lucky. Doesn't really matter though, does it? She wanted to die. I asked the nurse if I can go see her. She said no. I was just thinking maybe if you said something. - Sure. - Thanks. I'm sorry. Everything's gonna be ok. I know. Megan, I'm sorry I didn't believe it was this bad. Yeah, well, you couldn't know. It made me realize that I couldn't bear the thought of losing you. I love you. What about yesterday? I needed you, and you walked out on me. I'm sorry. Don't you ever do anything this stupid again. He killed my mother. She was gonna leave him. She said she was gonna take me away from him forever. He swore he would never let her do it. He said he would kill her first. You don't have any proof of that. No, but I know. Thank you. Dr. Spencer said it'd be good for us to, uh... Spend some quality time together. What do you say? I want Rich to spend some time with us, ok? Ok. Whatever you say. Your dad's in the next room. Shh. Shh. There's a bomb in his bike. It'll all be over tomorrow. Holy shit! Shit. What the hell are you doing? I couldn't sleep. Sorry. I heard noises. Oh, no, sir, please, don't apologize. It was my fault. I was just curious. Let's go. Morning. I know it's early. Thought you might want to come with me. No, I'm not into it. I'd really like you to come. Morning. Honey, what are you doing up so early? Oh, just wanted to see what you guys were doing. Made you an offer you couldn't refuse, huh? Here, take mine. This one is not as fast. Uh, that's ok, sir. I don't mind. You're not afraid of it, are ya? No. Why? Should I be? Oh, he's just kidding. He really wants to ride his own. I'll flip you for it. It's not that important to me, sir. Call it. Tails. Tails, I win. And I'm keeping my bike. Try not to fall too far behind. If you spill, I wanna be there to pick up the pieces. Let's go. Come on! Faster! Get away from the edge! Stop! No! Help me. Help me, Rich. I can't hold it anymore. You're killing me! It wasn't me, it was Megan. Megan? Megan said you murdered your wife. You liar! You thought it'd be easy for you, didn't you? Well, if I go, I'm taking you with me. Motherfucker! I regret the fact that this is becoming a regular occurrence, Mr. Gardner. What, you know him? He was there when I found Darla, yeah. I'm surprised you don't remember me, miss Bauer. I investigated your mother's accident. Why are you here? I just need to ask you a few questions. May I? We've seen these kinds of explosions before. It's generally an electrical problem. Purely accidental. Did your dad have any repairs done to the bike recently? No. He worked on it himself. He ever use a motorcycle instruction manual, anything like that? My father knew what he was doing. So then it wasn't an accident, is that what you're saying? No. I don't know what happened any more than you do. Mr. Bauer invited you to... be with him this morning? That's right. Before the explosion... Was there no warning, no smoke? Nothing like that? No. I mean, you know. It looked like there was something wrong, yeah. I don't know what it is, it just kind of blew, I guess. Terrible tragedy. If there's anything I can do, maybe put you in touch with a shrink, I know one that works wonders. Thank you. I'm sure there won't be nothing going on for a couple of days. If anything does come up, I'll be in touch. Well, I think we actually got away with it. Sooner or later they're gonna figure out it was not an electrical problem, Megan! The bomb was designed to burn away. No trace. I can't believe this shit's happening. All right, if they find out he was murdered, they could tie up the inheritance forever, even if they don't catch us. Do you understand that? You know, Rich, this wasn't only about the money. You knew that. I mean, I couldn't run away. It was him or me. Trust me, Rich, this will all work out, just like you said it would. All right, this isn't the way I meant, ok? Are you gonna stay with me? You know, it's starting to fade. What is? It doesn't feel like I killed someone. Don't worry, you're just numb. It comes and goes. How would you know? Rich. Richard Gardner? Yes, sir. Can I go with him? Sorry. You're welcome to join us on your own. You were wearing this jacket... at the time of Mr. Bauer's death, weren't you? That's what's in the report, all right? When we pulled him up, he was clutching on to this piece of that jacket. You might as well have written us a goddamn note. I was trying to save him. Why the hell didn't you tell us that before? - Don't know. - Excuse me? I don't know. Why were you trying to save him? What do you mean? Why were you trying to save him when you planted a bomb in his bike? I didn't plant any bomb in anybody's bike. Why were your fingerprints all over Mr. Bauer's tools? Quit harassing the kid. Do you really wanna do some serious time for this girl? Can I have her phone number? Why? Nice tits, great ass. Maybe she'll fuck me so I won't investigate her. You are way the hell out of line. And she's got all that money. Now that you're out of the way, maybe she'd like to share some. Fuck you. Yeah. You're probably right. She'd probably wanna keep it all for herself. We could trim it down to 10 years for involuntary manslaughter. You'd be on the streets in 5. No way. Where were you between 8 P.M. and 11 P.M. The night that Darla Hawks was murdered? What? I just opened the case. So, I bet you never thought that we'd be on these sides of the glass having this convo, huh? Wes, I never thought we'd be having this conversation. Anyway, what's up? Is she gonna spring you? I don't know. How can you not know? They want me to turn her in. Are you going to? I don't know. I haven't decided yet. Talk to mom and dad? Yeah. They send their love. Rich... How could you do it, man? I mean, all those years you just sat there and watched dad beat the shit out of me and mom. You never lifted a finger. Never! I mean, if you had it in you to kill somebody, why didn't you fucking kill him? Huh?! Why didn't you kill him?! What do you need, an invitation? How ya doin'? Doesn't have to be like this, you know. There are options. Have it your way. Oh... By the way, there's someone here to see you. God, I miss you. I wanna feel you inside of me right now. Megan, wait. What's the matter, you didn't miss me? We can't do this in here. Why, you think it might be incriminating? They want me to turn you in. And? What, and? I haven't told 'em anything. Then hy does it sound like you left out "yet"? Oh, don't worry about it, Megan. No, I'm gonna stay in here and burn while you walk away with all the money, ok? Oh, you think I planned it this way? I'm not saying that. Well, Rich, do you think I'm gonna leave you in here? I love you. Well, what can you do? Well, for starters, I came to bail you out. What can I do to make you happy? Tell me I don't have to go to jail. Remember when you said you wanted to run away with me? Well, you're just gonna get a little bit of a head start, and as soon as I get the money, I'm gonna join you. So we're gonna be on the run for the rest of our lives? Come here. I got a surprise for you. Megan, I thought this was stolen. Yeah, well, I guess the police are good for something. Here, it's yours now. Now meet me at the house. Trust me, ok? I've made all the arrangements. Car trouble? No problem, sir. Where you been, Wes? Rich Gardner, outlaw. I'm out on bail. Going somewhere? Yeah, well, I'm gonna skip town. They're just about done. They don't need me here anymore. I don't know, there's a little bit too much death around here for me. Kinda cramps my style. Besides, I wanna do something with my life. I don't wanna be a fuck up like you. You take care of yourself. I always have. Hey, Rich. See you around. I doubt it. Oh, no! Who were you expecting? My brother rich? He's dead. What are you gonna do to me? I don't know. What should I do to a... lying, murdering bitch like you? Why don't we start by having you take your clothes off. Why don't you take 'em off for me? It's much more fun that way. Until I saw you I wasn't sure you actually went through with it. Are you sure you didn't fall in love with him? Wes, I love you. I can't believe we got away with it. Believe it. Wes and his amazing penis. After you left, I checked the car really carefully. And I couldn't understand how the bomb got there... Now I do. Why didn't you go to the police, Rich? Or did you wanna take care of this yourself? I'm not a murderer. You see, the bomb was her idea. I thought it was too quick, not painful enough. Wes-- but now... I get to see the look on your face. You don't wanna do this, man. Oh, yes, I do. You will never know how much I hate you. Wes! Rich, he was gonna kill you. Rich, he's the one that beat me. He killed Darla. He killed Darla? All this was his idea. He was making me do it. Do you still love me? Put the gun down, Megan. Come on, rich. We can still do this. I mean, we can have everything. It was all you. But I really did love you. Here's your fucking wire.
