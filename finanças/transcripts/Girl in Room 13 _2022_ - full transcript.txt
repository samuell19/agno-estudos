Nothing. Doesn't look like nothing. How do you think she was? Grace? I don't know. She seemed like... - Like what? - Grace. What does that mean? Do you think she was withdrawn? Or what? No, no, no. Hey, hey. I just think we need to give her... I don't know, some space, that's all. Yeah. Well, I'll try to find the new normal... Of how to just be with her, But I get a little bit concerned that I'm... I don't know, That I'm looking after her too much, That I'm looking at every move that she makes Because I'm afraid of... Well, maybe I'm a little bit afraid of her... Relapsing. Well, that's not unreasonable. Mm-hmm. You do need to protect yourself. Last time was bad. Okay, but she needs 100% from us... 100% all in.

Please! ♫ ♫ So it's been two days since you last saw her? She borrowed the car to do a favor for a friend. Okay. That's what she said. That's what happened. Not now. Now, we know, of course, That Grace has a history with drugs. She's got prior arrests. Janie: No. I mean, yes, But that was years ago. She's clean now. She's clean now. She's been out of rehab for a month. This is not about her using. This is about what's happening to her right now. Okay. Well, I think I have all the information I need. I'll put that into our database. Janie: Oh, that is such a good idea. You're going to enter it into your database? Has that ever worked for you before? Did you find anybody like that? You're just gonna type it on in, And then, gee, we're gonna find her! Is there a lot of success with that? I do wish there was more we could do. So why don't you do it? - Janie... - What? Why isn't he... Why aren't you doing anything? Janie, Grace is an adult. Yes, I understand that. Who's missing. Appreciate it... But there's nothing here That indicates that a crime has taken place. Something happened to her! Adults are free to come and go And even disappear if they want to, okay? Oh. So, honestly, our hands really are tied. Okay... And that's exactly what you would do With your own daughter, right? You'd just put in her name in the database, call it a day? I don't think so. What would you do if it were your daughter? If it were my daughter, I'd follow the drugs. Oh... Find out who her dealer was And who she gets high with. You ask them some questions, something's gonna turn up. Okay. - Thanks for the tip. - You're welcome. Thanks, detective. Burt: Hey. Janie: Unbelievable. She's out there somewhere. They're not even gonna find her Because they don't care about her... Just like you! Nobody cares about her, Burt. Dammit! That's not fair. I'm here. - I'm here with you! - Yeah. Okay, I just don't have rose-colored glasses on. What? I don't have rose-colored glasses on. Neither do I. This is my family, too. Okay? It is. And it's my job to protect it... And I can't let Grace destroy it again. Oh, please! She didn't destroy it, Burt, I did... When I kicked her out of the house Told her that she couldn't come back in, And they found her on the curb the next morning, Almost dead. She made her choice. No. No. No. She was a teenager! I am the mother! I'm not gonna fail her twice, Burt. So you pick your side. (vomiting) Hey, hey, hey. I got you. Hey, come on. (vomiting) I can't hurt your face, can I? I own you, bitch. I own you! (vomiting) Look, mrs. Atkinson, I've always been really sorry about what happened to Grace. I never expected things... You know, Would get so out of control, for her. I appreciate that. What I need to know Is if she has contacted you lately. Have you seen her? Me? Look, I've been clean since high school. She went her way, and I... Went mine. It's beautiful. I need to find her. Oh, no. Is she... Is she using again? I don't know. But it doesn't matter. Either way, I need to find her, And if she is using, I need to know... Where she gets her drugs. Look, I told you... I'm clean. - Beth... - I'm out of that whole thing. How would I know where she would get drugs? Beth, I need a name. Or the name of somebody who knows a name. She's... Missing. Please! You were her best friend. I... Just need your help.

Break her in, just not too hard. No one likes a zombie skank. And hose that one down, I'll be back at midnight and I'll buy her from you. ♫ ♫ Yes! I guess there's no point in asking you to come to bed. I knew... I knew... I knew the doctor was giving her pain pills. No, Janie, this was not... And I didn't stop it. It was right under my nose and I didn't stop it. This was not your fault. It was not your fault. It was. You can't think like that. Honey... It's not your fault. Okay? (school bell rings) Come on, don't be shy. You've got to include me, huh? So, how much you guys need? So her again? Come on, man. Okay, light me up. She's a little cutie, huh? You're a dirty son-of-a-bitch, you. So, what, shotguns every hour on the hour, With some momentum here, boys. Hi. Excuse me. So what time? Come on. Are you cray? Who's asking? I'm Grace atkinson's mom. I don't know her. There's no reason to be nervous or lie, I just... I don't want any trouble. I just... Lady, I told you... Look, I just want to know if you've seen her lately. What? She's hurt or something? That's what I want to know. I really... I really want to know if she's... If she's using again. Please. Anything you know. Yeah. Heard she was out of rehab. Saw her. Talked about some rims. Some what? Oxy. I tried to sell her some. She turned me down. Told me she was staying straight this time. She meant it. She's good people. Sat next to her in eighth-grade English. Yeah? She is. You're all good kids. You're welcome. Now, this... This is a sandwich. I love the classics. That's what this place is all about. Really, I learned it all from mom. How's she doing? I love your mom, And she's steadfast in her belief in Grace. I don't know if she can go through it again. Even as strong as she is. I don't know. I wouldn't underestimate your mom. She's one of the strongest people I've ever met. I know. It's just... You know, Grace and I were always so close, And... There was nothing we couldn't tell each other, And then... I don't know, I just feel helpless 'cause there's nothing I can do for her, And then I start to feel guilty For not being more of a brother. I can only imagine how mom feels. This is what parents do. Loving unconditionally. That's the deal. Your mom... She feels the same way about both of you. Just because I don't say it, Don't think that you're unappreciated. Especially by mom. Thanks. - (phone ringing) - hang on. Rex's. Mom? Yeah, he's... He's right here. No way. They found the car.

It's okay. It's okay. ♫ ♫ I don't even know if she's being... Trafficked? Yeah. We're a middle-class family. You mean you're white. It's a misconception that this is an immigrant problem. 83% of sex-trafficking victims are u.S. Citizens. "By some estimates, There are up to 50,000... Sex-trafficked victims Every year in the united states." You said you saw your daughter last At the interstate? Janie: Uh-huh. It's called the heroin highway. Drugs flow along that interstate like water. Easy on, easy off... And cheap motels all along the way. And where there's drugs, there's trafficking. Vulnerable girls are easy scores. They seduce them, They drug them, And they break them. After ten days, they sell them... Some for internet sites. All those motels up and down the interstate? Behind those doors, it's all going down right now. They sell them? Ten days? Ten days... That's usually how long it takes to break them. Ten days. How long has your daughter been missing? Eight days. Rosa: You don't know this has happened to Grace. Okay? There could be other explanations, But here's some information That will help. If you need anything else, come find me, okay? Janie...? What are you looking at? Janie: He's gonna sell her. He's gonna sell her. (Janie sobs) Wasn't that a nice warm shower, huh? You're all clean... And fresh. You know... I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you so much. But it's showtime, angel. Why? Why... Why, Richie? Because you're my jewel in the crown. You're my ship coming in. Let's get you ready, baby. ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ Come here.
