Everything's going to be fine, darling. Madam, it's so wonderful to see you. Welcome home from the hospital. Jenny, this is Mrs. Cordoza. Yes. Thank you. I'll show you to your room, madam. Everything is just as you like it. I'm so happy to have you back home. Good night, dear Jenny. Good night, Lawrence. Larry. You call me Larry. Larry. Hey. Hey. Oh hey! Um... Fancy seeing you here. Uh... I actually... I have to sort of start getting ready for work, so... I might have to ask you to, um... - to, uh... - Um. - If you don't mind. - This is actually my flat. So... Oh shit. Um... Well, in that case, at ease, monsieur. No problemo. Love to see you again. As in, um... I had a really great time last night. Um, well, the thing is, Rob, I'm just... My name's not Rob. Um... - Andrew. - Andrew. Um... I actually... I just sort of came out of quite a straight-up soul-destroying... So, thank you. - I'm just saying I can give you my number. - Or you could not. And we could avoid the whole me feeling guilty and never calling you back. You feeling dejected, never hearing from me again. I feel so used. Well, you know what, Rob? Welcome to my world. - Name's not Rob. - Andrew. Fuck, sorry. Well, Andrew, it's been very nice meeting you, and you have a lovely day. - Ellie? - Yes. ♪ Tried to withdraw a guilty plea ♪ ♪ Damn! You ain't gonna pin this one on me ♪ ♪ One thing's for sure I'm not sleeping here tonight ♪ ♪ And I'm not interested In what you think is bad ♪ ♪ But I get so lonely I can't relate to anyone ♪ ♪ And my heart is crying out I'm on my knees ♪ ♪ I'm begging you please... ♪ How's it going? Staff meeting in five. Nick? Nick! I'm not talking to you, Ellie, because that only involves me losing my shit. What did I do? I get it. You've had a shit year, Ellie, but it is just not cool to so flagrantly disrespect us. - What are you talking about? - You abandoned us last night. We heard you went off with a random guy! How do you think that'd make us feel? - All right. I'm sorry. - And on my birthday. I'm... I'm really sorry. Nick. I'm serious. Are you stressed? You seem stressed. Mary Ellen died, and Janet wants a feature. There are not enough hours in the day. - When? - Sunday's edition. No, when did she die? - A couple of days ago. - That's so sad. - How? - Yeah, old age. - Yeah? - You know, I really wanna die that way. Why don't I take this one? I've got two hours left on this polish, and then my schedule is wide open. Okay? Okay. Okay. Consider your load officially lightened, my friend. - Morning, everyone. - Morning. How are we all? - Good. - Great. - Hi. - Hi. How you doing? Good. Thanks. Uh, I'm writing a feature on the paper's longest-serving women's editor. - She just died. - Yeah? Oh no. Yeah, no. It's my understanding she donated her collection of writings to the Archives. What time was... What's your appointment, sorry? Oh, no, sorry. I... um... I work here. Yeah, no, the thing is you... you still need to make an appointment. - We can't... - Even for staff? We don't just let people into the archive. Even though I work here. Yeah, no, sorry. Um... So if you... if you go online, um, you can find our online catalog and then decide, uh, whatever it is you wanna view. But I've done it a million times before... Yeah, um, and then either myself or someone from the Archive team readies your documents. In which case, I would love to make an appointment, please. Appointments have to be made online through our... Seriously? ...online portal. Online portal. You know what? Thanks so much for all your help today, and I will see you again sometime soon. I wish I could lose my memory. I'd run off into the sunset and forget I ever married Francis in the first place. Do you know how it happened? Where I was going? Larry says you were out running errands. Beyond that, I'm sorry. I don't. - So you really don't remember anything? - I remember in gaps. I don't know how I'm meant to behave. I don't know... I don't know how I felt about my life. I don't... All right, darling. I'll fill you in. You were lovely and funny and full of joie de vivre. You have the perfect life, the cleverest best friend. The rich, handsome husband who adores you. Do you know why we don't have children? He's away an awful lot, your husband. It's one of the reasons I've always been horribly envious of you. Oh, you'll be fine, darling. In the meantime, try to have fun tonight. Yeah. I don't believe it! Harold Wilson? The Harold Wilson? The very same. Please tell me he took you somewhere scrumptious. - Lockets. - Oh! His favorite place to holiday is the Sicily Isles... ...party now has a chance of getting a larger majority. Gentlemen, this is all well and good, but what we really want to know is what does the prime minister like for dessert? Darling, I think that's enough. - But it's just my second... - Doctor's orders. Just water. Speaking of which, you really don't remember anything? - Anne! - What? How about some coffee? Anyone? Yes, please. Hi. - Hi. - How you doing? Uh-huh. - You? - Phenomenal. Um, everything's ready for you in the reading room. Hmm. Spectacular. And sorry, we don't allow food and drink. Oh. Hmm. Right this way. So, this is everything from about '65 up until around '86, '87. These are her actual notebooks? Yep, they should be. Yeah. Thanks. Um, I just wanted to say quickly, uh, I really enjoyed your, uh, feature on starter marriages and all the, like, online dating stuff. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, yeah. The bit about, you know, the difference between passionate and companionate love. Yeah, I never really thought of it like that before. Thanks. It gives me a warm, gooey feeling knowing my unadulterated misery has finally been put to good use. So, um, how does someone like you end up making their living as an archivist? I studied art history actually. And went on to do a postgrad in Records Management, but... ...um, you know, at that point, I sort of realized, um, I sort of enjoy categorizing stuff, oddly enough. And, you know, people think it's a bit odd... My dearest and only love, I know you're frightened, but believe me when I say I've known nothing like this before and can assure that I never will again. I know I will never be satisfied with just a part of you. And for that reason, I'm going to take the job in New York. I'll be on platform two, Marylebone, Friday, 7:15 p.m. Come with me, darling. Spare him a life half-lived, a marriage of convenience. More importantly, spare yourself. Seize this thing that is true and real and infinite. Yes, it is scary, but I believe living a lie is worse. We could be happy. So happy. Know that you hold my heart, my hopes in your hands. Your Boot. ...historical materials. - I... I... I think it's actually... - Look at this! Huh? Um, what is it? It's a letter. Hmm. Jeez. Yeah, sad thing is if you're gonna elope now, you'll probably just send a text. WhatsApp. Yeah, it'd be like, "Hey, babes, meet me at the station if you're interested." #ComeWithIfYouWannaChangeYourLifeForever, smiley face, aubergine, road sign, sausage. The worst thing is when you can see they've read the message you've sent, and the little blue tick appears, and... - That's the worst. - "Hello, I sent a message five days ago." Five hours ago! - I mean. - Did I say days? I think so, yeah. - Can I see the envelope, please? - Yeah. - "J.S." Must be in here by mistake. - What do you think you will do with it? Burn it. No, I'm kidding. Probably make sure it gets properly cataloged. Don't, what about returning it? Hmm. Or trying to track down whoever sent it. "Dearest J, I know what the situation cost you, darling Jenny." "But I also know that you and I could no more not love each other than the Earth could stop circling the Sun." "You were upset the last time we parted, and I cursed myself for it." "My frustration overwhelms me." "There is never enough time, never enough of you." "Let's meet tomorrow. B." "My darling J, I'm still lost somewhere between our time dancing the night away at Alberto's and being together on the Riviera." B? "Felipe told me I was like a drunken fool as I remembered those summer days together." "If all we are allowed are hours and minutes, I will etch them on to my memory so I can recall them in the same way that when I close my eyes, I see your heavenly face." "You are never far from my thoughts. Your Boot." ♪ Strawberries, cherries And an angel's kiss in spring ♪ ♪ My summer wine is really made From all these things ♪ ♪ Take off your silver spurs And help me pass the time ♪ ♪ And I will give to you Summer wine ♪ ♪ Oh, summer wine ♪ ♪ My eyes grew heavy And my lips they could not speak ♪ ♪ I tried to get up But I couldn't find my feet ♪ ♪ She reassured me With an unfamiliar line ♪ ♪ And then she gave to me More summer wine... ♪ Good evening. Darling, don't forget we have breakfast in the morning. I have a journalist coming tomorrow, first thing. I'll change it to lunch then. Dinner, darling. We have dinner. Larry. Let's not fuss. Can I help? Yes. I certainly am hoping so. Am I at all familiar to you? Don't ring any bells, I'm afraid. And what if I were to say the name Felipe? Would that mean anything to you? - Are you with the police? - No. So why are you asking me about Felipe? Um... I believe we may have a mutual friend. Perhaps you might be able to tell me where I could find him? I don't think you understand. Felipe was, uh, in an accident. He never woke up. Hey, um, just so you know, we usually have to close the reading rooms around 5:00. What time is it now? Coming up to 20 past. Shit. Okay. Um... I'll be two secs. So, uh, did you find everything all right? Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. I mean, if I want to request more stuff, then I have to go on the, um... - Via the online. Yeah, same process. - Via the online. - The... - Online portal. - Process. - Yeah. - Where you headed? - Basement. Um, what if I wanted to see if there were any more of those letters? Could be a story in it. If you wanted to, you could just send me an email, actually. - If you wanted to speed things up a bit. - Oh. Thanks. Turning into a real rebel. Have a good one. Have a good week. Anthony O'Hare. Oh, yes. You're here to write marvelous things about my husband, I believe. Is that right? "Beacon of sound commercial practice, turnover increasing year after year." - Are you asking me or telling me? - I'm his wife. I can hardly be impartial. In my experience, there's no one more brutally impartial than a wife. Indeed. I'm afraid Larry is running a little late. Perhaps not so marvelous after all. Um, may we offer you a drink in the meantime? No, thank you. Mr. O'Hare. Mr. Stirling. - Please accept my apologies. - Not a problem. - Shall we start? - Ah, yeah. I'm ready whenever you are. I don't know how I didn't end up in the most awful trouble. What about you, Mr. O'Hare? You're a financial journalist. - Foreign correspondent. - Where have you been recently? Well, Léopoldville, mainly. Brazzaville. Godawful place if you ask me. And where this evening's exemplary host has a great deal of business. Well, I think that... I felt the Belgians were doing a perfectly good job of running the place themselves. With respect, I was there in '59, '60, and again in '62... So you of all people should understand that mutiny and rebellion are an inferior and foolhardy response... To centuries of oppression? I would suggest that taking back control politically, geographically is an entirely appropriate... Would one be correct in assuming that you are a supporter of Mr. Mobutu's? Larry, Mobutu's a dictator. I doubt very much... Yes, darling, I am aware. Thank you. Enough, enough. This is all far too depressing for the dinner table. My wife considers anything not in the pages of Vogue unworthy of her time and attention. I'll get out and meet as many people as possible, travel the world because people like that, they make me want to stick a revolver in my mouth and pull the trigger. And the women, Jesus! Spoiled little tai-tais with barely an original thought to string together between them... I'm sorry we were such a disappointment. Christ, I'm, uh... I'm drunk. Evidently. Perhaps, the next time you find yourself in the company of such bores, you'd do well to leave early. I just ask that whatever your views of me and my spoiled life, you won't attack Larry in print. Please excuse me. Goodness, I have the most splitting headache. Last night. Did you really drink that much? I have a fine feeling I did. - Mr. O'Hare. - Mrs. Stirling. What are you doing? Uh. I wanted to give you... this. What is it? It's an apology. Well, please. - Read it. - Jennifer. Mr. O'Hare has written it. I'm sure he's perfectly capable of reading it aloud. "Mrs. Stirling... I am an ungracious pig." "I'd like to be able to blame exhaustion or some uncharacteristic reaction to shellfish, but I am afraid it was the combination of the alcohol, which I shouldn't take, and the choleric temper of the socially inept." "There is little you could say about me that I have not already deduced about myself in my more sober hours." "Please allow me to apologize." "Yours shamefacedly, Anthony O'Hare." If at all possible, I'd love to take you and your husband to lunch. Hmm. How very kind of you. I'll think on it. In the meantime, I must return you to your hotel. I won't be responsible for you contracting sunstroke. Not to mention alcohol poisoning. Yes. Please. Thank you. Larry. - Mr. O'Hare. - Mr. Stirling. How are you? - Very well. Thank you. - Mrs. Stirling. Hi. How are you? I'm fine. Thank you. Tell me, Mr. O'Hare. Is there a Mrs. O'Hare? Yes, there was. Uh, Mrs. O'Hare and I divorced. Well, you have my condolences. It's a ghastly business. - Children? - Larry, for goodness sake. No, no, no, it's quite all right. Yes, I have one son, Peter. I was at Gordonstoun with a terrific chap by the name of Peter. English. Where are you off to next? After I finish the piece, back home to London. - Excuse me. - Of course. I apologize. It's okay. Aren't you drinking? Um, no, I'm not meant to. A headache? Doctor's orders. So you really found last night that unbearable? I admit it. I find armed conflict a less daunting prospect. You're William Boot from Scoop. - Evelyn Waugh? - I know who William Boot is. Is everything all right? Duty calls. Tell me, Mr. O'Hare. How are your sea legs? Thank you. What do you think? Big. Of the view. Hmm. See that over there? It's Corsica. You travel a lot? I don't, actually. We come here every summer, but I haven't been back overseas since we married, not even to see family. Larry does all the traveling now. How'd you two meet? We were seated next to one another at a company dinner in New York. Our fathers used to work together. He asked me out, and that was that. That simple? It was. A few months later, he asked me to marry him, and I said yes. My parents were delighted. How so? Good family. Good job. Those things are important to you, are they? Aren't they to everyone? I guess so. I want you to tell me about your son. - My son? - Hmm. Lives with my ex-wife who does her best to make sure I don't corrupt him. And why would she think you would corrupt him? Because I was unfaithful. You must miss him. I do. Sometimes I wonder whether if I'd've done what I did if I'd've known quite how much. Is that why you drink? Don't try to fix me, Mrs. Stirling. Who said I was trying... Oh, you have that charitable air about you. It makes me feel nervous. Well, I'm guessing I wouldn't be the first. You'd make a very good journalist. Did you love her? Your wife? I thought I did before, but we were young, and I'm not sure I knew what love was. - Have you ever loved anyone? - My son. Have you ever loved anyone? I'm married. You are. For the record, Larry and I are perfectly content. I'm glad to hear it. Features. Yeah, hi, I was wondering if I could speak to Ellie Haworth, please? Speaking. Oh, hi. Yeah, it's... it's Rory from Archive. I think I might have maybe found something you might want to come and take a look at. Hi, hi. Is, oh... - Uh, is that gum? - Uh-huh. Yeah, we don't... we don't love gum in the reading rooms. - Swallowed it. - Great. Okay. Um... I found another letter. "It's 4:00 a.m., and I can't sleep." "It's like The Road to Madness, but I lie here imagining him next to you, his license to touch you, to hold you, and I would do anything to make that freedom mine." "For as long as I can't have you, I'll conjure you here instead." "Your scent, your hair, that slow sideways smile when something I say amuses you." "Darling J, I've never wished harder for the dawn. Your Boot." Mmm. It's definitely... Definitely the same. Yeah, it's the same kind of envelope, same handwriting. Now I'm going to have to know how it ends, which means not only is the rest of my day fucked, but, guess what,so is yours. How fucked are we talking? Well, I have to know if there are more of these. Uh, yes, um... The only problem is,at this stage, um, if we're gonna find out if there are more, it's probably gonna require going down to the actual archive. Great! Oh my God! Let's do it! Yeah, but to do that, we need a special permission. Um... How do we do that? Well, there's a form, and then after that is probably, well, another form, actually. Sounds... sounds easy enough. Let me... let me see what I can do.

Thank you for the offer and frankly, for the rescue. I'm indebted to you for persuading me out of my room yesterday. I would love to return the favor. I know nowhere, of course, but if you can suggest a place, I can keep you laughing with my terrible schoolboy French. Dear Boot, I'm delighted I managed to propel you, blinking, into the sunlight. I would be happy to take you up on your invitation. Perhaps we can spend a few hours in town commiserating over our mutual inadequacies with the local language. Are you free on Thursday? I'm free Thursday, but I'm also free tomorrow and the day after and the day after that as well. By the time Mr. Stirling returns, we could very well cover the entire coastline.

Either. Imagine that we have everything we need, the perfect blanket, plenty of cheese. - Bread? - Bread, and there's a river nearby. Oh, a river. And my son, he loves to, uh, fish. So I hope you don't mind, um, we try our hand at a little fishing. I'm afraid I know next to nothing about fishing. Which is why I'm going to teach you. How am I doing, Mr. Boot? You're a natural, as it goes. Of course I am. And you catch a trout. Shark. Shark. Excellent work. And afterwards... out of the leftover teeth, I fashion you a necklace. A souvenir. A talisman.

Have it to you by Friday. Mr. O'Hare isn't quite ready yet. He suggests either you are very welcome to wait down here or head upstairs. Room 302. What a lovely surprise. Sorry. I'm a little early.

I have never wanted to kiss someone so badly, but when you looked up at me, something changed. And in that moment, I feared our desires would destroy us. You're an honest, remarkable creature, and I did not want to be responsible for making you someone less than you are. For that reason, I've spent the last week hating myself for the one decent thing I've ever done. So consider this. Spontaneity is at the heart of many wonderful things, but it is also at the root of much discontent. And if we are to embark upon something, I ask only that we make this decision as one. I write these words with you in mind, and my heart swells. So whatever the outcome, let us survive together. You'll find me at Postman's Park on Friday at 6:00 p.m. I'll be there waiting.

Thank goodness because I'm ravenous. - What are we having? - Wild fruit. Namely? Elderberries. Blackberries. Maybe some dandelion. Perfect. Mmm. Good night, dear Boot. What? What is it? I don't want you to go. What if we ran away together? To where? - How about New York? - Hmm. I love New York. I've been offered a post there. And I want you to come with me. Hmm. Move to New York with me. - You know I can't. - Yes, you can. Yes, you can. We can. You're just asking me to run away, to just give up my life? Well, in order to start a new one, yes. - And when you grow tired of me? - That won't happen. - It has before. What makes this different? - What makes... Everything.

Watching you return home every night to a man who... A man who what? I think it's entirely possible that you might be wasted in the life you're in. Boot, it's true. I was brought up to do what is expected of me rather than what might make me happy. I'm afraid to love you. I'm afraid that if I let myself go, I'd love you so much it would consume me. And I fear that once I cease to be a novelty, you might tire of me. You have to understand that if I were to leave with you, it's not just my family and my security I would lose. It's my very peace of mind. And it's a risk I don't think I'm strong enough to take. I hope you understand. Yours always, J. My dearest and only love, I know you're frightened, but believe me when I say I've known nothing like this before and can assure you that I never will again. It's with that certainty that I've decided to make a bold decision. I'm going to take the job in New York. I'll be on platform two, Marylebone, Friday at 7:15 p.m. Come with me, darling.

"They're in my head from the moment I wake until I fall asleep again, and if I can't say them, I'll write them to you again and again." "I love you, dear Jenny. Your B." Shit.

Get your stuff together. So why would you invite your ex to your birthday party? I didn't. I had no idea she was gonna be here. Well, who invited her, then? She's my sister's friend, and I'm not talking to any of them tonight. - So what happened with you guys? - She was religious. But I guess when we met, she was only a bit religious. And as the relationship went on, she was like, "Actually, the fact you don't believe in God is a deal breaker for me." But, in the end, she married this guy. You know. You win some, you lose some. What about you? - You don't wanna know about me. - You couldn't be more wrong. Well, I was with someone for a while. Define a while. Eight years. And he really wanted kids, but I didn't. So... so we broke up. I'm sorry. That isn't even the end. Then we got back together and then broke up again. Then there was this whole awful smorgasbord of haphazard shagging. And then finally, he proposed. Uh, we were on holiday with about a dozen of our nearest and dearest. Oh gosh. Yep. I mean, it wasn't even that I didn't love him. I just... I just wasn't sure that I loved him enough. Maybe I do want kids. I don't know. But pretty much knew for sure I didn't want them with him. Well, that sounds like a really shit breakup. I'm sorry. And that is why people shouldn't talk about themselves, 'cause it's depressing. Yeah, it's really depressing. I think it might be time for your birthday dance. My birthday dance? Yes.

No, no, I want to find out who owns one of them. Are you the owner of the box? No, I... I want to find out who owns one of them so I can write to them. I mean, I want to find out if they still own it, if you, uh... if you see what I'm saying. You've obviously not heard of that little thing called "data protection." You know what, um? Don't worry about it. I will, uh... I'll figure something out. Dear J, this might sound strange, but I found some letters that may belong to you, addressed to JS, postmark 1965. They appear to be of sentimental value. If you could bare to tell me, I'd love to know the story behind them and Mr. Boot. With all best wishes, Ellie Haworth. "Dear Miss Haworth, I do not wish to speak to you regarding the events of the period outlined to me in your letter, and as such will be unable to assist you any further with your investigation." "Sincerely, Jennifer Stirling." Okay, I'll see you. - Bye. - Bye. Hello? Is that... is that Mrs. Stirling? Speaking. Hello, hi. I'm, um... I'm Ellie Haworth from The London Chronicle. I... I wrote to you regarding a series of letters that myself and my colleague... Yes, yes, and I have responded via the enclosed address. Yes, um... I... I just... Look, um, if now is inconvenient, I'm... I'm more than happy... I'm sorry, but as I said in my letter, what happened between myself and Mr. O'Hare is a private matter. Yes, of course, and I'm... I'm very sorry for intruding. Um. I just wanted at the very least to return... Hello? Hello? Shit. Mrs. Stirling, lovely to see you again. We've missed you. Yes, it's... it's lovely to see you too. I wouldn't suppose you have a spare key? I seemed to have left mine at home. Certainly, ma'am, but PO box 13 is no longer in service. I'm sorry? As per Mr. Stirling's request, it's been closed for the last month. Well, reopen it now. Please. Certainly, ma'am. Mrs. Cordoza, I need the keys to my husband's study. I'm afraid this is an instruction and not a request. Of course. Thank you. My dearest and only love, I know you're frightened, but believe me when I say I've known nothing like this before and can assure you I never will again. I'll be on platform two, Marylebone, 7:15. Seize this thing that is true and real and infinite. More importantly, spare yourself. Living a lie is worse. I'll never be satisfied with just a part of you. - It's my very peace of mind. - Come with me, darling. - We could be happy. So happy. - I would love you so much. Know that you hold my hopes, my heart in your hands. - Yours always, J. - Your Boot. What are you doing with this? Larry, why have you been tampering with my mail? They, um... They found it on you... the day of the accident. I'm guessing you know who wrote it. Yes. Yes, his name is Anthony O'Hare. Was. A journalist. I introduced you. The two of you, it seems, were engaged in some kind of... Jenny, he was killed. Wait. - He was beside you in the car. - No. No. The man beside me in the car was named Felipe. The driver was Felipe, but the man in the passenger seat was a Mr. Anthony O'Hare. And when you woke from your accident, I made a decision. I was trying to protect you. - From what? - The truth. I didn't want you to have to bear the guilt. Holy shit. Anthony worked at The Chronicle. Yes. - Hello? - Ellie Haworth? - Uh-huh. - This is Anthony O'Hare. Oh. Um. Hi! Um. I believe you wish to speak with me. Yes. Uh, hello, Mr. O'Hare. So, how did you stumble on my story? Well, initially, I was just... I was just following an instinct, and... well, then I thought there might be a feature in it. And then the more I read, the more I started to feel... I just... I found them incredibly moving. So, did she meet you? D... Did you go to New York together? No. Mrs. Stirling did not accompany me to New York. And was that the last... I... I mean... Did you... Did you ever see each other again? ♪ Christmas is here Bringing good cheer ♪ ♪ To young and old Meek and the bold ♪ ♪ Ding-dong, ding-dong That is the song ♪ ♪ With joyful ring All caroling ♪ ♪ One seems to hear Words of good cheer ♪ ♪ From everywhere Filling the air ♪ ♪ Oh, how they pound Raising their sound ♪ ♪ O'er hill and dale Telling their tale ♪ ♪ Gaily they ring While people sing songs of good cheer ♪ ♪ Christmas is here Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas ♪ ♪ Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas ♪ ♪ On, on they send On without end ♪ ♪ Their joyful tone To every home... ♪ Jennifer. ♪ Throw cares away Christmas is here ♪ Jennifer. ♪ To young and old Meek and the bold ♪ ♪ Ding-dong, ding-dong That is the song ♪ Am I really that much of a fright after all these years? ♪ Words of good cheer From everywhere ♪ ♪ Filling the air Oh, how they pound... ♪ - Can we go somewhere? - Of course. ♪ Gaily they ring While people sing songs of good cheer ♪ ♪ Christmas is here Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas ♪ ♪ Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas ♪ ♪ On, on they send On without end ♪ ♪ Their joyful tone To every home ♪ What must you have thought of me? Well, I assumed you to be a loyal wife. And I returned to my work. New York? It's been my home for the past four years. I was on my way... to meet you. There was a crash. I was left unconscious. I couldn't remember anything. Until I saw you tonight. I had found your letters, but I was told you... I was misled. I thought that I'd lost you. Misplaced, perhaps. But certainly not lost. Boot? Yes, dear Jennifer. Would you kiss me, please? Come back with me. I can't lose you again. Too many things have changed. I'm still in love with you. Can you please help me? I have a daughter. What's her name? Esme. She's two. Bring her. Hmm? I can't. Forgive me. I'll wait. Tell me to wait for you, and I will. I love you. I always have. I'm so sorry. So that was the last you saw of each other? No more letters? No more letters. Do you have them with you? Yes. The... the letters, yes. Here. What if I could put the two of you in touch? No. I chose to respect Jennifer's decision all those years ago. It seems only right to me I continue to do so. I wonder if these ought to be returned to Mrs. Sterling. I already tried. Well, you're a journalist. Try again. Can I help you? Um. Mrs. Stirling? Yes. Well, I'm, um... I'm Ellie. Ellie Haworth from the, uh... Um, look, I'm... I'm... I'm just... I'm not trying to... I just... I met with Mr. O'Hare, with Anthony, and, um, he wanted me to give you these. He wants you to have them, and it is his express wish. What did you two discuss? Well, uh, you. Mostly. He... he told me what happened. In the end, you... you chose your family. ♪ Johnny boy, my friend Stop them again ♪ ♪ For a lonely girl In the world ♪ ♪ Of the stone buildings That would turn brown ♪ ♪ If they were born ♪ ♪ In the town Where the trees are grown ♪ ♪ Johnny boy I'm alone ♪ ♪ Please take me home ♪ What's all this, then? ♪ Johnny boy, my friend Please hold my hand ♪ ♪ In the middle of the... ♪ You lied to me. You told me he was dead. Why? For the sake of our marriage. By allowing me to believe that I'd killed him? I know that I betrayed you, Lawrence. I live with it every day. And I have spent the last four years of my life... trying to be a better wife for you. But I remember, Larry, I remember everything. And the truth is, you and I were broken long before Anthony came into my life. - Jennifer. - Don't touch me. - Jenny, listen... - No, you listen to me now! The only reason I am still here is because of our daughter. From this day forward, I am your wife in name only. And if you so much as attempt to treat me otherwise, I will take our daughter, and I will leave. Now if you think the courts will side with an adulteress, then you're delusional. And if you try to leave, if you try to take my child, I will destroy you, and you'll never see her again. Do you understand? Hi, darling. Hi, baby. We're gonna go on an adventure, okay? Hello, I'm looking for Mr. Anthony O'Hare. He's in room 268. Mr. O'Hare is no longer staying with us here. When did he leave? Yesterday. Thank you. Ma'am? Stop for a second. - Anthony? - Excuse me. Ma'am? What's going on in here? I've been trying to explain. - Mary Ellen? - Anthony? I'm... I'm looking for Anthony O'Hare. I need to know where he is, please. I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but Anthony handed in his notice. He resigned this morning. - Did he leave a forwarding address? - I'm sorry to say he did not. Perhaps you could see to it that he gets these. If you hear from Anthony again, please tell him I was looking for him. So then you... you went back to your husband? I just couldn't risk losing her. And I did eventually leave him, when I knew for certain that the law would support my decision. What about Mr. O'Hare? Did you try getting in touch with him once... once you'd left? I would scour the papers every day looking for his name. Nothing. And eventually, I stopped buying the paper. It felt to me as though he didn't want to be found. But what about now? You know, he doesn't know that you tried to go after him. He has no idea. Probably for the best. We had our chance. Yes, but what... what if you could have another chance? Our heart can only take so much, and I fear, at my age, I've reached my limit. The past can be intoxicating. It can draw you in, create the illusion that things were better, you were happier, or experiences were richer back then. It can also debilitate you, leaving you stuck in your memories of pain, heartbreak, and disappointment, holding you back from even attempting another shot at happiness. They say if we don't learn from past mistakes, we're bound to repeat them. But can we also learn to let go of the past, learn to forge ahead, keeping the knowledge close but not letting it overtake our ability to try again, to feel again? Ellie, it's fantastic. Okay. Um... Really good work here. Well, that's great. I... I appreciate that. I'll be back later. - Hello? - Hi, it's, uh... it's Ellie. Um, how's it going? Yeah, I'm fine. You? Uh, pretty good. No, that's... that's... that's not actually true. I don't know why I left without saying goodbye, and I don't know why I didn't reply to any of your messages. That's, uh... That's a really shitty thing, and, I mean, if you wanted to message me again, you have my word you'll get a reply. But I get there might be a ton of reasons why you don't wanna speak to me or write to me or hang out with me. And, in truth, I'm kinda worried you might think I'm a pretty heinous individual if you get to know me, but... But at this point, I don't think being afraid to try is a good enough reason for anything. And I... I think you're fucking tip-top, Rory. And I'd... I'd really love to see you again. I hope you don't mind me saying that. Look, where... where are you? I'm... I'm... I'm outside. Sorry? I'm outside your flat. Oh my God. That's so creepy. Yeah, well, I was aiming for industrious but I... um, I take your point. Okay, okay, wait there. Just keep talking. I'm gonna come down. Keep talking. I'm so sor... I found them. Both of them. I went to see them. - You're kidding. - No. Shit. What did they say? - She tried everything. - He still doesn't know she went after him? - No, he's got no idea. - So you have to tell him. I know! I want to, but they don't wanna see each other. If that was true, then why keep the PO box open the whole time? That doesn't make any sense. That is a really good point. She really came after me? She said that to you? Dear J, please forgive this brief intrusion, but as I'm sure you are aware, our very separate lives have thankfully, at least for this old man, once again intercepted. In the intervening years, I've thought of you with a constancy I hesitate to now admit. Missing you. So I shall venture one last time, with some trepidation. Postman's Park, Friday, 2:00 p.m. Yours respectfully, B. Oh, she's not coming. At least we tried. I'll go and get him. How about we close our eyes? A letter. An invitation... to come away. To start again. Marylebone. Waiting. I am starting to worry now. But there's really no need. Because I'm right here.
