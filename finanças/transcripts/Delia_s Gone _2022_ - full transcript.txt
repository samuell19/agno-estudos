- Ready, Delia? - Okay, let's. And a one, and a two, and a one, two, three, four. - All right, you try it. - Yeah, okay. Trout's ready. Go on. You cook it. Just pour in the oil, easy-peasy. Yeah, but what about the recipe? Just put the oil in the skillet and cook the damn fish, Louis. But you said you'd do this recipe. I changed my mind. Things change sometimes, Louis. Well, I like it when things stay the same. You try it. You've gotta learn sometime. And I want to eat before we head into town. When I cook fish, I only use oil. Louis, will you just forget about it? Well, what did he do? Just tell me the truth. Okay, okay. When dad died, he pulled me close. You were out tending to your birds or some other. Her said he lived a double life for years. Said he hit and ran over a kid when he was 19. He would have just kept on confessing but I told him... told him to hurry up and die. My secrets are coming to the grave. The truth is for the birds. Ravens know how to imitate us better than parrots do. Ravens sure are clever. Is that so? Pull over in front of the pharmacy here, Louis. I'll see you back here in five, okay? - Five minutes. - Good. What do you need that for, Delia? Some things you only get with a gun. That's not right. This world ain't right, but we gotta live in it, don't we? See that race last night? Nope, I was watching the Buckeyes. Darby grabbed a quarter in the home stretch, messed up her leg. Don't trust that horse anymore. Yeah, I always lose at the track, don't much care for horses. Yeah, you would. Grab some pylons, I want to see how those boys are doing on that water main. Yep. Can't be drinking it when it's that murky. Nah, a little bit of chemical is good for you. - Hey, Frank. - Afternoon, Sheriff. "Little bit of chemical is good for you?" Then what's the point of having those purifiers, then? It's our body's job. Too many people have allergies these days. Excuse me, Louis. Need to move your truck. Too close to the hydrant there, Louis. Yes, sir. Too close. I know I'm splitting hairs here, but if you just slide back three or four feet, you're golden. What colour am I? Just move your truck, Louis. Thank you. Move your truck. Move your truck. What are you doing here, anyhow? I'm waiting for Delia. Have a good day, buddy. Good day. Go. Drive! Back home. You shouldn't steal. Nobody can afford medicine anymore. The locker had plenty of pills, so... Yeah, but you shouldn't steal, Delia. But these are for you, Louis. You're a sweet man, Louis. You know how much I love you, right? People are always going to see you different, but it's okay, 'cause you're better than them. That's the God's honest truth. Come. Let me teach you how to dance with a woman. Come on. That's it. I know you don't... you don't like change, Louis, so don't get angry, okay? I got laid off. But they're offering me work out on that line near Toledo. I'm gonna move out there. I'm really sorry, Louis. You can't move out west. I don't have a choice. I've gotta work, Louis. But you live here, with me. I just got you six months' worth of pills. You're full time at the hardware store. You can get by on your own. I don't want to. You got by those two weeks I went hunting with Morag. Hey, look, I'm sorry. Louis, I'm sorry. Let's go to the tavern and have a drink, we'll talk about it there. No, no, I go to bed at 9:30. - I know... - I don't drink. I know, but one beer won't kill you. I don't drink 'cause it makes me mean. Dad's gone now, Lou. You can do what you want. Just come out with me tonight, it will be fun! I go to bed at 9:30! Ow! Ow! Let go of me, Louis! That hurts. Relax, Louis. You're hurting me. You can't leave, Delia. Okay. All right. All right. I'll drink here tonight. Hmm? You can go to bed? 9:30. I've got beer in the fridge. Just relax. Come on. We'll figure it out in the morning, I promise. I'm just... I'm gonna go get my beer, okay? Delia? Yeah, this place right here. Delia? Delia? Delia? Delia? Delia, wake up. Louis? Louis, you in there, bud? Oh no... Hey Delia, you in there? Oh no... Hey, Louis, I... You all right, bud? You got some blood on your hands. There was a break-in at the pharmacy, we need to talk to Delia. Delia's gone. - What? - What? Delia's gone and I don't know what's up there beyond the sky. Hey, bud, we're just gonna... We're gonna have to take a look, Louis. Why don't you step back, okay? We're just gonna have a look inside. Anybody else... Oh shit! Delia? Oh, God. Oh shit. What happened, Louis? - Send me an ambulance. - I don't know. I don't know, I was... I was drinking last night. You do all this? Yeah, yeah. You hurt your sister? Mm-hm. Mm-hm. - I did, I did. I grabbed her. - Why'd you grab her? I grabbed her last night because she said she was leaving, she said that she was moving. But you didn't want her to go? No, you see, I could have gone with her, but I told her I go to bed every night at 9:30. Every night, 9:30! I'm so stupid! - Okay, come with us. - So stupid! Walk nice and slow, Louis. Okay, bud. Here's what I'm gonna need from you. I'm gonna need you to walk outside. Come on out slowly. Okay now, Louis. Walk straight out the door and to the left to the truck. We'll sort this whole thing out. Okay, buddy. Will the defendant please rise? Mr. Hollins, would you like to make a statement that I might consider before passing sentence? I've been thinking... He has nothing to say, your hon our. Counsellor, please. Do you understand that you have entered a plea of guilty to voluntary manslaughter? Well, I understand I killed my sister, and the Lord says, whoever takes a human life shall be put to death. I deserve that. Your remorse has been noted. Louis Hollins, I hereby sentence you to five years at an Ohio state correctional facility. Louis! All right, Tom. Right this way. All right, everybody, it's a beautiful day. Let's get some exercise. Jen, you okay back there? Right down there. Stay over by the right side. Hold onto the railing. Hey, Louis, we're going down by the lake, get some exercise. Come on with. There's plenty of birds down there, too. Let's go. Eyes back on me. Larry told me you brought up the incident in the river. I nearly drowned in the river out back of our house. I know. That resulted in brain trauma. What else do you remember? They took mom to the hospital after that. Then Delia took care of me. She kept saying mom took her life. But I don't see how you could take a life. It's an expression, Louis. Your brain injury shows mostly the same symptoms as those on the spectrum. Remember, not everything we say is as it sounds, right? Metaphors, jokes. Mom never joked. How about Delia? Did she ever make you laugh? You know, if you talk about her, it can help us get back to the old Louis. I also heard you sang. What's your favourite song? "Ring Them Golden Bells." Can you sing a little for me? That's stupid. ...Brown, and may be stubborn, too. Rock pigeon... Few birds have been associated with humans so closely as the Rock pigeon... There's a visitor here for you. Come on, Louis, your first visitor, that's exciting! Hmm. You can sign yourself out for a few hours, get out of my hair. I can't leave here. I live here. Tell you what. You go see him inside, and I'll get you macaroni for lunch today. Hello. I guess you know Louis? - Hey, Louis. - You gonna be okay? All right. Do you know who I am? Uh-uh. Well, I'm from Ledding, same as you. Even now looking at you, I can't help but remember that strange kid that used to wander up and down the roads, barefoot and all, dragging a stick or pulling a damn wagon. I used to drink with Billy Dyson. Well, he never drank much so I did the drinking, and then some. Him and I were playing pool at TJ's that night your sister Delia showed up. I just bought that old bar actually. See, I'm in construction. I'm gonna give it a new feel. A pancake house. You know, somewhere you take the family after church. You... you saw Delia that night? Yeah. But I got right with the Lord since then. Become a new man, sobered up, AA and all that. Been raising my daughter, Rosie. Billy Dyson, he's tried to turn his life around too. Become a man of God. He's got his own church over there in Downey. Saving folks one at a time. Hell, I guess you could say he even saved me. Why are you telling me all this? 'Cause the truth is, I don't know how much you remember about that night... The truth is for the birds. Do you have cancer? Why would you say that? Nobody knows. My dad had cancer. But Delia took her secrets to the grave. Louis. You don't know the whole truth, how she died. How do you know? How do you know?! Hey, is everything all right? Yes, we're fine. We're fine. Sorry, thank you. Tell me what you know! Tell me what you know! That's enough, Louis! - It's okay, it's okay. - Step back now. Okay? - ...Easy, big fella. - What's going on?! Do you understand me, Louis? Louis just got a little over-excited. We're not done here. - Okay. - Hey, you be on your way now. - Come with me, sir. - Okay, okay! - Be on your way. - I said come with me. Yes, fine! I'm on my way. Okay. I'd like to learn about all creatures. Over in India, three men separated a mama elephant from her calf, they just took the little guy. And years later, that mama found those men, elephants' got a good memory, like me. She just wanted to know what happened to her kin. What's that? Whose kin? Delia's my only kin. Listen, you're eating alone today on account of that outburst. What was the name of that man? Who, the visitor? Um, ledger said Stacker Cole. Billy Dyson lives in Downey. Stacker Cole was at the tavern. Billy Dyson lives in Downey. Stacker Cole was at the tavern. I guess he knew your sister? What? Louis, don't look at me like that. Whatever he said, forget about it. I'm sorry, Larry. Hey, Louis. Good morning. Some fresh air, Louis? Louis? Louis? Where are you going? Yup, I hear you, Miss James. I know Louis, all right. And Stacker. Yeah, it does seem odd. I'll get to the bottom of it. Bye now. Detective Cole. Hi, Fran. Bo Walton here. Sheriff Bo Walton. What's going on? Oh nothing, just got a call about an assault. It was at that Deerhurst mental home. It was Louis. Yeah, he disappeared after your brother paid him a little visit. Bit strange, isn't it? Hmm, no shit! Yeah, I don't know what's going on, I'm just going to head over there right now. Franny? Billy Dyson lives in Downey. Stacker Cole was at the tavern. Billy Dyson lives in Downey. Stacker Cole was at the tavern. Well, the visit happened right over here. And then as soon as I saw the altercation happen, - I intervened. - You gonna press charges? Uh, well, it is within my right, but I don't have to. Oh, no, I didn't mean to say you couldn't, it's just more of a, you know, anytime we can avoid... You didn't have to come by. Any sign of Louis? Uh, no. That's what we're just discussing. This is State Police Detective Francine Cole. We used to work together. Guess she's here to see why her brother is running around causing mischief. I was just about to ask these folks if, uh, if Louis had ever exhibited any violent behaviour while here? No, no. Okay. And you had said that he got a little agitated - during the visit? - No, um, Mr. Cole said something to him, and then Louis yelled, - "What happened?" - Let me ask you something. How'd he just walk out of here? He finished serving his sentence. This is a voluntary home. They are free to come and go. I've gotta take this, I'm sorry. Maybe he's just out for a stroll? No, no, just the thought of changing routines sends him into a tizzy. I don't think he'd go out for a stroll. Yeah, your brother must have really said something to set him off like that. Yeah, thanks, Ian. Yeah, sure enough, Ben Patterson's boy sees Louis walking outside his old house, doing God knows what. I'm gonna go pick him up before we miss him. - I'll come with you. - I got it. - Like hell. - All right, we got it. - I'll drive. - I'm driving. She's a peach. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Pick a card, any card, Delia. Okay. Do I keep it or do I show it to you? - Got it. - You won't forget? - No, I'll remember. - All right. All right, what was your card, Delia? Six of spades. No! Billy Dyson lives in Downey. Stacker Cole was at the tavern. Billy Dyson lives in Downey. Stacker Cole was at the tavern. "Some things you only get with a gun." Yep, sounds good. No, I appreciate you calling, Ian. All right, bye. Yeah, so Louis was spotted leaving his house heading east. - Maybe try to cut him off at... - Purdon Line. - Yeah, yeah. - Purdon line. Yeah, that's right. This car is a pigsty. Doesn't Alison clean in here anymore? She took a break after you left. Oh, you think I miss that shit hole station? You know, I prefer it a bit shambolic. - What? - A beautiful mess. You know, they say that creative people live in messy environments, you ever heard of that? Like, Einstein had a messy room. Kinda like that. That's Louis, all right. Slow down, buddy! Well, that's not Louis. Maybe he took a turn down Maple Hill? Could have went up Kells Road, what do you think? Where do you think he's going? I don't know. When I retire, maybe I'll snatch up one of these little farms. Have some chickens. A goat or two. Cattle, uh-uh, stay away from them. But not goats? When I was living at my ex-husband's ranch... Goddamn his soul. One day, he's giving it to me on the living room couch. He stops, he stands up, he's all bug-eyed, I said, "Finish me off, Jesus Christ!" But he's just staring out the window. I get up, I see this ornery old goat just standing on the hood of his brand new Chevy pickup. He's... he's chewing on the antenna! Just bit the thing right off, just staring at him, as if to say "Screw you for not buying a Dodge." You'd like to own some of them goats. Personality in livestock is... it's hard to come by. Let's go see Stacker. Is Stacker Cole here? You say something? I said, is Stacker Cole here? No, he's picking up his daughter. You the drywall guy? I need to talk to Stacker Cole about my sister. Billy Dyson lives in Downey. Stacker Cole was at the tavern. Well, what do you think? I think you've been acting funny lately, dad. I just got a lot on my mind, is all. Hi. Hi, who are you? Wow, you have big eyes. Ostriches have eyes bigger than their brains. They can spot predators two miles away. Is that an iPhone? Do you have Google on that phone? Yeah, why? Well, I want to search Billy Dyson's address here in Downey. We're not supposed to talk to strangers, and you're strange. Wait here. I think so. My dad made this for me. I need to search your phone. Want to trade? So what's the name again? I can't tell you my name. They might be looking for me by now. No, like, the man you're looking for. - Billy Dyson. - Who is looking for you? - Greys are so boring, dad. - You're boring. - You're boring. - You're boring. - You're boring! - You're boring! - Just pick a shade! - No, it's boring. Too grey. Hey there, Stack. Hey, Bogey. - How you doing, Missy? - Good. Hi, Aunt Franny. Kid. Well, we need to have a chat about your visit with Louis. Hey, why don't you take these colours and go pick one that you like, okay? But not pink. What's wrong? Oh, other than Louis attacking a male nurse and then just... disappearing. Where'd he go? Kinda hoping you might tell us. Why'd you visit him? To tell him the truth. Tell him the truth? What's the truth? What'd you say? I told him that I was drinking with her that night. - You brought up Delia? - I did. Yeah, okay, we all know that this was the last place Delia was seen before she died. Is there something else we should know? No. - So nothing? - No. Anything else, Bo? No, not right now. Not that I can think of. Okay, let us know if you hear from Louis. Our number's still the same. Oh yeah? So is mine. - Bye, Rosie. - Bye, Aunt Franny. Good to see you. Hope you know what you're doing here, Stacker. Everyone loves pancakes, Sheriff. He's Sheriff now. That's right, don't forget it. What's going on, dad? Nothing, nothing, nothing. Just your Aunt Franny being your crazy Aunt Franny. Come on, sit down. Show me what you got. Spiced pumpkin and candied yams. Sounds like something we should put on the menu, not on the wall. Not a chance, pick another one. Is it true that when you're cremated, they burn your body? Where's this coming from? I don't want to be burned. Do you? I hadn't, um, actually thought about it. No. How about that? Was, um, Delia Hollins cremated? Were you eavesdropping? I mean... if I knew I was going to die, I'd be scared. Everyone's scared of dying. You said Mom wasn't, driving through that stop sign. Well, she didn't have time. Hey. Maybe that's the best way. Come here. Hi. Is this Billy Dyson's house? It is. I need to talk to him. Come in. Someone's here for you, Bill! Hello there. Are you Pastor Dyson? I am indeed. How can I help you? Do you know who I am? You look familiar. This is my wife, Helena. We met already. I haven't met your eldest boy. Does he have good manners, too? Gregory is not... He's not here. Where is he? How can I help you? Was he killed like my sister Delia? Do you know him? Greggie was adopted. Why don't you go to your room, buddy? I wanna play here. What happened to Delia? I don't know, Louis. Louis Hollins? Go to your room! Stacker Cole said you were with him the night Delia died. I have to finish a sermon so let's... Let's continue this conversation across the road, shall we Louis? What's going on, Bill? I'll see you later. Bill? I hate to say it, but I think your brother might be hiding something. You know what? I think I'll take another look at Delia's case file tonight when I get home. How is married life, Bo? It's great, yeah. I don't miss it. What happened to Delia? Please, Louis. It's Saturday. You need to go home now and rest. I don't follow my Sabbath any more. How do you know about my Sabbath? Your father. Good bye now. How do you know my father? He was a gentle man. Like yourself. Go rest. You should embrace your faith again. Are you a Seventh Day Adventist preacher? No. Dad used to say our soul's sleep until Judgment Day, but I don't know when that'll be for Delia. Well, some people feel that if our souls go straight to Heaven when we die, what's the point of resurrection? I'm sure your father read Martin Luther to you growing up? "As soon as thine eyes have closed shalt thou be woken." "A thousand years shall feel as if I'd slept for about a half-hour." You've got a good memory, Louis. Delia says like an elephant, but I think that's just a metaphor. Yes, it is. The Peregrine Falcon can fly up to 200 miles an hour. Is that right? It flies way high up in the sky, then it barrels down for its prey. You're interested in wildlife? Things that fly and elephants. I need to go to work. You need to go home. Enjoy your Sabbath again. I can't enjoy anything until I figure out what happened to Delia. Put that away, Louis. You know it isn't right. This world isn't right, but we gotta live in it anyhow. Come in my office. I'll tell you the truth. Have a seat. Brother Stacker told you about me? Stacker Cole never mentioned you were brothers. In Christ, Louis. As you are also my brother. Delia was my only kin. Were you drinking with Delia that night? Yeah, I was there with Stacker and Lyle. Who's Lyle? My cousin, Lyle. Who's your cousin Lyle? Lyle Dyson. We were just drinking and having fun. Did he kill Delia? Are you calling your cousin? I'm calling the police, Louis. But why? For your own good. Leave right now and I will not mention a word about this. Wake up. Where does Lyle Dyson live? I can't do this! I can't do it. This puzzle is hard, Louis. Do you see the fisherman, Delia? Oh yeah. He might just fall into that waterfall. He's looking for trout. Oh, is that what he's looking for? Okay. You've reached Stacker Cole. Leave a message. 3-35 in the fourth quarter. 21-17 Nebraska... Hello? Hey, got any leads tonight? Anything useful in Delia's file? Hey, there. No, nope, nothing yet. Why? You hear something? Uh... I got a couple ideas I'm working on. I'm at home. Where are you going with this? We looked into that already remember? Why don't you just get your fat ass over here? Yeah, why don't you just stop by the station tomorrow in the morning? Bye. Truth is for the birds. Lyle Dyson at Hugh Excavating LTD. Lyle Dyson at Hugh Excavating LTD. When Louis mentioned his sister Delia, I saw Bill go white. I should never have let him walk off with that crazy man. It's not your fault. Course not! He sleeps over there when he's working late, but I should've suspected. Let me ask you this. Billy being a pastor and all. A lot of people confided in him. Do you think that Billy might have known something about Delia, maybe about her death? We all know Billy, Lyle, and Stacker were with Delia that night drinking. I didn't know that. He never told you? Oh. Where do I turn? Fire up conveyer two! Excuse me. Which one is Lyle Dyson? What's that? Which one is Lyle Dyson?! I got no kiddie fiddlers on my crew. I fired his sorry ass. Hey, you gotta be wearing a helmet back here. Go on, get back. Excuse me. Where does Lyle Dyson live? Hey, let's go! See how thick she is? Like a milkshake. Is that on a jig? Nah, man, lures. I use crank-bait. I got this purple one with an orange belly. I used to make lures. Oh yeah? Yeah. Wet fly streamers, imitating leeches and crayfish. Hey, you work here, man or what? What's your deal? I'm looking for Lyle Dyson. Lyle Dyson? If he's awake, he's drinking. Well, where does he do his drinking? Why do you care where Lyle does his drinking? I need to ask him some questions about my sister, Delia. Oh... Oh, that sick bastard. Yeah, he'll be Cheffy's. You know Cheffy's? It's a bar on the corner of Fulsom and County Rd 9. Fulsom and County Rd 9. Fulsom and County Road 9. You're pissing up the wrong tree. This has nothing to do with Delia's death. Well, I think you might have some blinders on there, Franny. Stacker being your brother and all. That has nothing to do with it. There's a murder now in Downey. There's an unhinged dude running around. This is way above your pay grade. Well, Louis assaulted a nurse in Ledding, so technically... You are not on this homicide, Bo. But, Fran, if we're talking about... You going to go up against me? I just want us to do our jobs. I'm not telling you again. Yeah, well, I am a Sheriff so. Are you still here fat ass? You've become a real piece of work. And Delia's murder case is still my jurisdiction, you know that. Give her, Daniels! Give her! Ride you shit-for-brains. Are you Lyle? What'd you say? No. That's Lyle. Are you Lyle Dyson? I'm Louis Hollins. My sister was Delia Hollins. Louis Hollins. I just saw ya on the TV. What happened to Delia? Tell me! Piss off. Hey, you following me? Yeah, I'm following you. Pastor Dyson said it was your fault. Did you kill Delia? What did Billy tell you before you killed him? You tell me what happened to my sister. Easy there. We drank with her, then she went home. And you killed her. I don't ever wanna hear that name Delia Hollins again. And a one, and a two, and a one, two, three, four... You gotta keep going, Delia. Okay. Where does Lyle Dyson live? It's break time. Two visits in two days. You see the news? Louis killed God damn Billy Dyson. Bashed his brains all over the church floor. What? You think I'm to blame? Why you poking at him, why you buy this place? Because I'm trying to do something good around here. More than you can say for yourself. I've done nothing but look out for you. Really? Okay. What about Rosey? You were like a mother to her, but after that night you just stopped showing up to see her. When you became a bible thumper that was really it for me. I'm sorry you started to hate yourself. One bad thing don't gotta lead to another. Is that what happened? It's exactly what happened. You started drinking, right. Then you lost your job. - I got promoted. - Okay. And then what about that bad shooting and the time off, from the skimming on the side. And you're a saint? You know the shit I took being the only female Sheriff around? Oh. What a grand excuse. Why don't you run along now? Go collect your bribes or whatever you do with your day. I'm gonna go check on Lyle Dyson. He's the lowest scum of the earth, but, hey, that's what I do. I protect people. Lyle Dyson, are you in there? Who's there? I'm Louis Hollins. I'm looking for Lyle Dyson. Have you see him? Does it look like it? He ain't here. You're Lucinda Hollins' simpleton son? Doreen says we can't use that word. Hell, this country's so fixed on calling everything fancy, they forget about speaking the truth. Your mother was a truth-seeker. You knew my mom? Everybody knows everybody around here. She was in our County Orion. A group of us seers talking to the dead. I can feel that spirit in you too, boy. Come here now. Come here, show me your palms. How do you know Lyle? He's my dear brother. Doctors say he's all messed up, but I say he's just misunderstood. I imagine like you are, Louis. Me and Lyle are nothing alike. I haven't eaten all day. Do you mind if I just... Don't you touch my wings! And put away that pistol, boy. Well, if you're blind, how do you know... I can hear it and smell it. You're a naughty boy, Louis. You killed others besides your sister and you aim to kill again. No, I never killed, Delia. You see this here line? It's straight to hell for you. No! I got hold of him, Lyle! Lyle? Lyle?! Lyle! You're a coward, Lyle Dyson. You killed my brother, Louis. No, he took his life. It's Vicky Dyson! Get me the police. Louis Hollins just killed my brother! Hey there, Franny. Guess who they called first? Go find a fucking apple-fritter. No, I'm not leaving. The hell you won't. He killed my Lyle! See that? There's Lyle. Shot himself. - He killed my brother! - I'm get ya a copy. That's his crazy-ass sister. You might not wanna go in there. Okay, get lost. Yeah, no! Yeah, no, I won't get lost. I'm sick of your shit. Woo. Bo's grown some little balls. Don't make me pull your rock, Fran. I bet if I looked under it, I'd find some nasty critters, yeah? I know you're tangled up in all this somehow. That's the first decent threat I've heard out of you, Bo. You might learn to be Sheriff yet. Although... ...you really need to shoot at someone first, at least draw your gun. You ever shot at a human being? Thankfully no. No, I have not. I don't know what you're trying to prove with the wild west shit? I would be the first to... To pull my firearm if need be. I'm gonna go canvas. I'm gonna go see if anyone's seen Louis. You wait here, you just twiddle your thumbs. No, I'm done twiddling. Bo! I'll canvas. You wait here. - I'm not your... - Bo! ...Fucking pet! Shit. Shit. Cole Contracting. Oh, is this Missus Cole? I'm looking for Stacker Cole. No, I'm her daughter, Rose. She's not, like, with us anymore. Alarm bells. That means you got a predator bearing down. Scared chickadees. Don't you hear them? Chickadees are real pretty. How old are you? Twelve. Well do you have a big brother or a big sister to watch over you? No, it's just me. Who is this? I've been alone too since my sister died. You really shouldn't be alone, so young and all. Oh, I've got another call coming in. Can I speak with your father? He's at the tavern. Who is this? Take care. Hello? Hey, Rosey! Is your Dad home? Uh, no. Is something wrong, Aunt Franny? He's not answering his cell. Oh, he should be at the tavern. I just got off the other line with a strange man. He wanted to know where Dad was, too. He was all into birds. Who was it? Was it Louis Hollins? - That was Louis? - What did you tell him? I told him the truth. Okay. Of course you did, honey. You've reached Stacker Cole. Leave a message. Answer the goddamn phone! Stacker Cole? Finish telling me who killed Delia. I was wondering when you'd get here. You tell me what happened that night after you left! I was so drunk I couldn't even stand, but somehow we made it to the bunker. What do you mean, what bunker? It's out the back, through the woods. Show me. You don't wanna go out... You show me now! Okay. You really don't need... Go! Go! Is this the spot? In there. Show me. Yeah, that sounds like Louis' truck. I'm on my way now. Thanks, Allison. This is it. Sit down over there. How much did Billy tell you? A man of God shouldn't run away from his own sins. Louis. Drop the gun, Louis. I can't. Some things you only get with a gun. Toss it! You wanna die?! It's okay. He just wants to talk! Just toss the gun away, Franny! Toss it! Okay, Louis. Okay. I'm putting it down. Come in here where I can see you. Slow. I'm coming nice and slow, okay? It's just me, Louis. Okay? Not too close. I'm just gonna keep my eyes on you, okay? Tell me what happened. Go on! Like I said, I can't remember how we got down here, but... I was sitting here. Lyle and Delia, they were over there, they were kissing, all innocent at first. And at some point... Lyle, he wanted more than just kissing ya know? And then what? I tried to tell him to stop, but I was so fucked up, I couldn't form the words, I couldn't help. Okay. He just laughed at me and kept on at her, and then she pushed him away. Then he reached for her, and he grabbed her shirt, and ripped it and Billy... - That's enough. - No, it's not! And that's when he got on top of her. She kept fighting, but he was too strong for her. Once he finished, you know, having his way with her, Billy must've went next because all I remember is him pulling up his pants. How did she die? Somewhere along the line she must of hit her head. She was all still. That's when somehow I managed to call my big sister, Sheriff Franny. You knew about this? By the time I got here, Lyle and Billy were long gone. He was sitting next to her, out of his mind. How did Delia get home? She drove her to your place. Left her on the floor so you might take the blame. To save you. That's a terrible thing you done. I know. And I am so sorry. We're gonna do what we should have done a long time ago. We're gonna fess up, we're going to clear your name, Louis. Then people, they're going to see you differently now. No. I don't care what anyone thinks about me. I just wanted to find out the truth. It's not just for the birds. That's just a metaphor. I know about those now. Louis! The police are here! It's over, buddy. He's got a gun, Bo. Stand down. Come out slowly with your hands up. It's under control, Bo. Hey, I'm Sheriff now, damn it! You're going down for this, Fran! Louis, drop the weapon. Louis! Damn it. Louis. He had his gun raised at me. Shit. It's okay. - I wanna go home. - You will. Alison, I need you to send an ambulance. Rosie's gotta watch for predators. Yeah, yeah, she does. She's too young to be alone. Chickadees are pretty birds. Here, pretty bird. Here, pretty bird... Goodbye, Delia.
