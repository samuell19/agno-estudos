HEIL HITLER. ( indistinct chatter ) ( indistinct chatter ) TELL ME, GENTLEMEN-- DO YOU THINK, AS WE BEHOLD THE JEWS IN ALL THEIR GLORY, WE CAN KEEP OUR BREAKFAST DOWN? ( laughter ) YOU'LL GET USED TO IT, SERGEANT LOTT. ( girl singing, accordion playing ) ( coughing ) NO. NO! NO! NO! TAKE HER. ( indistinct chatter ) NO. SONYA! SONYA! LET HER GO. GOOD. WELL, CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, THAT WILL BE ALL FOR TODAY. YOU CAN GO BACK TO YOUR ROOMS. LOTT, DO YOU HAVE FURTHER BUSINESS HERE? ( truck engine starts ) WILL IT GO ON LIKE THIS, RABBI? SOON THERE WILL BE NONE OF US LEFT. RABBI...WAIT FOR ME. PAPA? RABBI. LEAVE HIM ALONE. WE SHOULD GO INTO HIDING. IT'S RIDICULOUS, THE WAY WE SIT AROUND EACH DAY, WAITING FOR THE TRUCKS TO COME. ( woman speaking Yiddish ) OH, BE QUIET. ( man singing in Yiddish ) NO, IT'S GOOD. IT'S GOOD TO HEAR YOU SING PUCCINI. I'VE ONLY HEARD YOU SING FOR THE DEAD. KOHN WILL BE HERE FOR THE DEAD. IT'S THE LIVING WHO'LL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM. MAYBE WE SHOULD ASK THE COUNCIL--THEY KNOW ALL THE ANSWERS. THE COUNCIL?! THE COUNCIL! HE WANTS TO ASK THE COUNCIL. HELPLESS OLD MEN WHO STAND BETWEEN US AND THE GERMAN ARMY. THE COUNCIL! ( Kohn continues singing ) BUT IF YOU GOT TO THE COUNCIL, WHAT HAPPENS? THEY DON'T TAKE US AWAY IN TRUCKS ANYMORE? WHAT HAPPENS? EMMANUEL, I'M NOT THE GERMAN GOVERNOR GENERAL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE HAS ON HIS MIND, NOR DO I KNOW WHAT THE GOD OF ISRAEL HAS ON HIS. ( singing continues ) RABBI? YES? IF YOU COULD GO TO THE COUNCIL, WOULD YOU WRITE MY MOTHER'S NAME DOWN? YES. ANNA. ANNA GRINPANZ. ANNA GRINPANZ. AND MY SON, RABBI. A WEEK HE'S BEEN GONE NOW. ANNA GRINPANZ--SHE WORKED AT THE BRUSH FACTORY. YES, HAIKA. DIDN'T COME HOME LAST NIGHT. THEY SAID HE WAS PUT IN A LABOR DETACHMENT. ( crying ) I ONLY WANTED-- I ONLY WANTED TO KNOW IF HE'S ALIVE. THAT'S ALL I WANTED. FAYVEL. OF COURSE--FAYVEL. HAIKA. SO, RACHEL, WE LIVE ANOTHER DAY. ANOTHER DAY, PAPA. ( blows ) WELL, PAUL...IS IT BETTER WHERE YOU ARE, MY SON? IS IT BETTER? I WAS THINKING AS WE WERE STANDING OUT THERE-- I WAS THINKING HOW ODD HUMAN BEINGS ARE. EACH TIME THE TRUCKS COME AND WE STAND THERE ON THE EDGE OF DEATH--ON THE VERY EDGE-- AND I SEE PEOPLE TAKEN AWAY TO BE BURNED OR TORTURED, AND WE JUST STAND THERE, HOLDING OUR BREATHS. AND THEN IT'S ALL OVER. AND WE THINK ABOUT THE NEXT MEAL, WE THINK MAYBE ABOUT A JOKE WE HARD, MAYBE WE LAUGH, MAYBE WE CRY A LITTLE. BUT LIFE GOES ON JUST AS IF WHAT JUST HAPPENED DOWN THERE WAS NOTHING BUT A RITUAL. MM-HMM. A PLAY, SOME MAKE-BELIEVE MOMENT THAT ISN'T REAL. THIS IS WHAT GOD GIVES US SO THAT WE CAN RETAIN SANITY, THAT WE CAN LIVE EACH DAY. IF THERE WERE NO JOKES, NO MEALS, IF ALL THERE WERE WERE TRUCKS EACH MORNING, THEN WE WOULD ALL LOSE OUR MINDS. SO, ON WITH ALL THAT. YEAH. CZERWIEC. FAYVEL. I KNEW HIM WHEN HE WAS A CHILD. HE USED TO PLAY WITH YOUR BROTHER, HE HAD A VERY SERIOUS LITTLE FACE. HE USED TO SAY, "RABBI, I GO TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I BECOME A G-MAN." HMM. G-MAN. ( chuckles ) HE TOOK YOU TO A DANCE ONCE. REMEMBER? YOU WERE JUST A LITTLE THING YOURSELF. YOU COULDN'T HAVE BEEN NINE YEARS OLD. I REMEMBER. I WAS VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH HIM. WE HAD DISCUSSED MARRIAGE. HEH. HE WAS ONLY, UH, 13 WHEN HE TOLD HIS FATHER THAT WE WERE TO BE MARRIED, AND HIS FATHER SAID-- VERY SERIOUSLY, PAPA-- HIS FATHER SAID, "YOU ARE 13 AND RACHEL IS 9, AND THIS IS TOO YOUNG FOR MARRIAGE. YOU SHOULD BOTH WAIT A YEAR." A YEAR? MM-HMM. THAT'S JUST RIGHT--A YEAR. ( both laugh ) AH. WE SHOULD HAVE SAVED OUR LAUGHTER FROM OTHER YEARS. WE WASTED IT. IT WAS AN HEIRLOOM. NOBODY REALIZED IT. Woman: RACHEL! OH, EXCUSE ME, RABBI. RACHEL, I NEED MY DRESS TODAY. IT'S ALL READY, GINA. OH, CAN I SEE IT? YOU CAN TRY IT ON. LOOK. LOOK WHAT I BROUGHT YOU. OH, GINA. I FOUND A TURNIP. I STOLE IT. I CAN BRING CARROTS, TOO. I KNOW WHERE I CAN FIND CARROTS. I KNOW A SOLDIER. DON'T TELL. PAPA? POTATO AND TURNIPS FOR YOU. IS IT ENOUGH? NO. BUT, THEN AGAIN, YES. BE CAREFUL. BE CAREFUL? OF COURSE, BE CAREFUL. BYE, GINA. RABBI. WILL I LOOK PRETTY AGAIN? ( baby crying ) RABBI. I HAVE A WONDERFUL PLAN, RABBI. A WONDERFUL PLAN! I'M GOING TO BUILD A DUMMY WALL RIGHT HERE, ALL THE WAY UP. IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE ANY OTHER WALL, BUT BEHIND IT IS WHERE I CAN HIDE, RIGHT HERE, LIKE THIS. VERY GOOD. RABBI...I WOULD APPRECIATE YOU NOT TELLING ANY OF THE OTHERS. I MEAN, I'M NOT A SELFISH MAN. BUT IF NONE OF THEM HAVE THE FORESIGHT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES, WHY SHOULD THE INDUSTRIOUS AMONG US HAVE TO SUFFER THEIR IGNORANCE? WHY? RABBI...BUT, OF COURSE, THIS DOESN'T APPLY TO YOU AND RACHEL. YOU MAY COME DOWN AND SHARE THE SECRET PLACE WITH ME ANYTIME YOU WANT. I EXPECT I'LL START CONSTRUCTION ON IT TOMORROW SOMETIME. ( humming ) ( knock on door ) LET HIM LOOK. COME IN, RABBI. WE ARE GROWING TEETH, RABBI. SO I SEE. WHERE DO THESE THINGS COME FROM? THE GUNS, WE BUY ON THE ARYAN SIDE. THE PIPES, WE FIND IN EMPTY HOUSES. THE HARDEST THING TO FIND IS THE BOTTLES. BUT WE FIND THEM. GOD PROTECT YOU. AND GIVE US STRENGTH. IT WON'T BE VERY LONG NOW. ( Kohn singing in Hebrew ) ( continues singing ) EL MALE RACHAMIM. THE SONG FOR THE DEAD. BUT WE HAVE DIED, ALL OF US, TOO QUIETLY. NOW WE WILL DIE TRYING TO LIVE. SO IT IS ORDAINED, SO IT SHALL BE. ( singing continues ) ( laughing ) JOSEF, JOSEF, JOSEF. YOU ARE AN OLD INFIDEL WHOM GOD WILL PUNISH FOR THIEVERY. AND YOU, A RABBI WITH A BIG MOUTH, A CRANK, AND A WASTE OF MY TIME. COULD I EXPECT LESS FROM YOU? A MAN WHO CHEATS AT CHECKERS WILL STEAL ANYTHING. THIEVERY IS RELATIVE, ADAM. IF I'D TAKEN THIS FROM A WIDOW, I SHOULD BE ON MY WAY TO HELL BY NOW. BUT, COURTESY OF THE GERMAN ARMY, WE HAVE... BREAD. HA HA! HA HA! WE HAVE CANNED FISH. WE HAVE CANNED VEGETABLE SOUP. AND A BOTTLE OF SCHNAPPS. HA HA HA HA HA! AHH. NOT THIEVERY, ADAM, BUT A MINOR VICTORY-- BUT A VICTORY NONETHELESS-- FOR CHINIK THE POLE. GOD KNOWS WE POLES HAVE HAD FEW VICTORIES THESE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. SO, DON'T JUST SIT THERE, RABBI. GIVE IT YOUR BLESSING, OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU DO. MAKE IT ACCEPTABLE. IT'S ALREADY EDIBLE. YEAH. ALL THOSE YEARS YOU WORKED FOR THE SYNAGOGUE. I THINK I'LL BE FORCED TO TAKE AWAY YOUR HONORARY MEMBERSHIP IN MY FAITH. I SHALL DISCHARGE YOU FROM MY CONGREGATION. ADAM, I'M JUST A POLISH PEDDLER, EDUCATION ON THE STREETS. BUT I'M A GOOD JUDGE OF MEN, THAT I AM. AND IN 30 YEARS, I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU WITH A DOUBT. THIS IS NO TIME TO BEGIN, HUH? SO, I'M INVITING MYSELF TO DINNER, MAINLY BECAUSE I'M THE ONE WHO SUPPLIED IT, AND AFTER DINNER, I SHALL PROBABLY RUN OFF WITH YOUR BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER. YES. LATER, WE WILL ARGUE ABOUT THE SOUL, BUT FIRST, LET US CONCERN OURSELVES WITH OUR STOMACH. AN EMPTY STOMACH IS NOT A GOOD POLITICAL ADVISER. PREACHING AGAIN! YOU'RE PREACHING AGAIN! CAREFUL, JOSEF. PAPA. PAPA, HURRY. HURRY. PAPA, PAUL HAS COME HOME. PAUL! PAUL, PAUL, MY SON. OH, PAUL. HE ESCAPED FROM THE LABOR CAMP WITH SOME OTHERS, AND THEY'VE BEEN HIDING IN THE FOREST FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS. SOMEHOW HE FOUND US. HE FOUND OUT WHERE WE WERE. Josef: ALL THAT TIME AS GUESTS OF THE NAZIS. NO WONDER HIS FACE LOOKS LIKE THAT. HIS FACE, JOSEF-- DID YOU LOOK AT HIS FACE? THE FACE OF POLAND, RACHEL-- WOUNDED AND IN PAIN. OH! YES, MALKALE. LET ME COME AND GET YOUR SKIRT LATER. MY FATHER IS RESTING JUST NOW. I'LL BE DOWN IN JUST A MINUTE. HE--HE HAS-- LOOK AT HIM. LOOK AT HIM. IT IS MY SON, MY SON, MY BOY WHO COMES BACK TO ME FROM THE GRAVE. MY SON, WHO LEAVES A BOY AND COMES BACK A MAN. OH, WHAT'S THAT? WHAT? OH, YOU ARE AN OFFICER. A LIEUTENANT. A LIEUTENANT! HE LEAVES A BOY AND COMES BACK A MAN, YOU KNOW? LOOK AT HIM. CHINIK, CHINIK, DO YOU RECOGNIZE HIM? THE BOY YOU USED TO TAKE TO CARNIVAL SHOWS AND GET HIM SICK ON CANDY-- IS THIS NOT THE SAME BOY? NO, THIS IS A MENSCH! A MENSCH! MENSCH! OH, MY GOD, I'M-- PSHH! PSHH! LET'S HAVE A CELEBRATION! CELEBRATION! PAUL! PAUL, YOU ARE HERE. PAUL, WILL YOU LOOK AT THIS OLD INFIDEL? THE THIEF WHOSE SOUL I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SAVE FOR SO MANY YEARS. MY ONE ACT OF PROSELYTIZING AFTER 30 YEARS IN IN THE RABBINATE. HE'S ONE THICK-HEADED POLE. AND LOOK AT THIS BOTTLE OF SCHNAPPS. THIS POLISH THIEF HERE-- MAY GOD FORGIVE HIM AND MAY GOD BLESS HIM. HE HELPS KEEP US ALIVE, THIS JOSEF. RACHEL, I'M STILL-- MY HEAD IS STILL TURNING! PAUL IS ALIVE! I WALK IN THE BEDROOM, AND THERE HE LIES ON THE BED! ( truck approaching ) HOLY VIRGIN. GERMAN COMMAND CAR. OH, MY GOD. UP TO THE ROOF, QUICKLY. ( speaking German ) ( overlapping chatter ) BOOKS. HMM. BOOKS, BOOKS, BOOKS. RAINER MARIA RILKE. THE SONNETS TO ORPHEUS. THE APOCRYPHA. HMM. WHAT IS YOUR NAME? ADAM HELLER. HMM? ADAM HELLER. YES, SIR, I'M A GERMAN. NO. YOU ARE A JEW. WHAT WORK DO YOU DO? I AM A RABBI. A MAN OF THE CLOTH. ISRAEL ZANGWILL, OSWALD SPENGLER, SIGMUND FREUD. YOU HAVE HEAVY TASTES, MR. RABBI. I SAID YOU HAVE HEAVY TASTES. IT PASSES THE TIME. IT WHAT? WE ARE NO LONGER PERMITTED FORMAL WORSHIP, SO I SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME READING. HMM. ADMIRABLE. AND WHO IS THIS? THAT'S MY SON. AND HE IS WHERE? HE HAS BEEN MISSING FOR THREE YEARS. POLISH ARMY. OFFICER. WHAT BRANCH? LIEUTENANT OF INFANTRY. ( laughs ) A NATION OF READERS TRYING TO PRODUCE A WARRIOR. YOU KNOW, LOTT, IT'S VERY UNUSUAL FOR A JEW TO BE A LIEUTENANT OF ANYTHING, EXCEPT PERHAPS OF LITERATURE AND BANK BOOKS. ( laughs ) AND THIS IS THE DAUGHTER OF THE MAN OF THE CLOTH, HMM? YOU HAVE A NAME? RACHEL. WHAT? RACHEL. AND HOW OLD IS RACHEL? SHE'S ONLY 19. SHE'S ONLY 19. HMM. 19 IS A GOOD AGE. 19 IS A FINE AGE. ISN'T 19 A GOOD AGE, LOTT? YES, IT IS, SIR. THERE ARE A FEW MADMEN AMONGST YOU WHO TALK OF REVOLT, A FEW SAMSONS WITH DELUSIONS OF THE PAST--THE GLORIOUS HISTORY OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE. I SHOULD REMIND YOU THAT WEAPONS OF ANY KIND WILL BE CONFISCATED AND THE OWNERS SHOT ON THE SPOT. DOES THE RABBI OR HIS DAUGHTER HAVE ANY WEAPONS? NO. DO YOU KNOW OF ANY? YOU'RE ASKING THE WRONG PERSON. AND WHO IS THE RIGHT PERSON? NO ONE. RABBI, WE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR KIND. STAY HERE, LOTT. HAVE YOU SEEN ALL OF THEIR PAPERS, CORPORAL? THERE MUST BE LAW AND ORDER. ORDER, I HAVE NO DOUBT. BUT--BUT LAW, MY YOUNG FRIEND, THIS YOU COULD ARGUE ABOUT. IF IT DISTURBS YOU, THEN YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE STARTED THE WAR. I SHOULDN'T HAVE STARTED THE WAR? SOMEONE-- SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED IT TO ME WHEN I INVADED POLAND. RABBI. COME HERE. COME. COME HERE. YOU, TOO, LOTT. SERGEANT, I'M SURPRISED AT YOU. YOU LET THESE PALTRY PEOPLE BE SO INSUBORDINATE. TEACH HIM. SIR? TEACH HIM, SERGEANT. KNOCK HIM DOWN. SIR? SERGEANT, I WANT YOU TO HIT THE RABBI. ( grunts ) WE SHOULD HAVE A TALK, SERGEANT. EVEN THAT-- EVEN THAT WAS RECORDED IN THE BOOK. EVEN THAT. NO, NO, IT'S NOTHING, NOTHING. A BEE STING. A SCRATCH FROM A ROSE THORN. WHAT IS IT COMPARED TO WHAT THEY DID TO YOU? NOTHING. WHY, YOU SAID SOMETHING? YEAH. WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO SAY? HE'S A JEW-- THAT'S ALL IT TAKES. CHINIK, YOU'RE A LONG WAY FROM HOME. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE IN THE COMPANY OF JEWS? I'M IN THE HOUSE OF MY FRIENDS. YOUR FRIENDS? I DON'T SEE ANY MARK ON YOUR FACE, NO STAR OF DAVID ON YOUR SLEEVE. WHAT ARE YOUR CREDENTIALS? PAUL. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, PAUL? WE'RE OLD FRIENDS, WE DON'T NEED ANY SUBTLETIES-- SUBTLETIES, WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF SUBTLETIES, SHABBOS GOY?! WHEN THEY PUT THIS BADGE ON MY FACE, YOU GENTILE PIG, THERE WERE NO SUBTLETIES INVOLVED. OR THE WELTS ON MY BACK THAT GO THIS DEEP-- ALSO NOTHING SUBTLE. OR IN THE MAIN STREET OF KRAKOW WHICH I PASSED LAST FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND SAW 1,000 JEWISH CORPSES END TO END. THIS WAS THE MOST UNSOPHISTICATED SCENE, MR. CHINIK. AM I ACCOUNTABLE FOR-- YEAH, YOUR KIND IS ACCOUNTABLE, ANYONE WITHOUT A STAR ON HIS SLEEVE. THAT MAKES YOU AN OUTSIDER. Adam: DID YOU HEAR THAT? HE WEARS NO STAR ON HIS SLEEVE, SO HE'S AN OUTSIDER. PAUL! PAUL, INSTEAD OF THIS TALK, WE SHOULD BE SITTING HERE, EATING...WHAT THIS OUTSIDER HAS BROUGHT US AT THE RISK OF HIS LIFE. UNDERSTAND? AT THE RISK OF HIS LIFE! JOSEF, JOSEF... YOU MUST FORGIVE HIM. HE'S GONE THROUGH A LOT, THIS BOY. HE'S GONE THROUGH TOO MUCH. FORGIVE HIM. PAUL. PAUL, PAUL, PAUL, PAUL. JOSEF CHINIK BROUGHT YOU YOUR FIRST BOOKS. YOUR MOTHER WAS ALIVE, WE HAD A PARTY, AND JOSEF CHINIK BROUGHT YOU THREE BOOKS. THREE BOOKS. PAPA, WILL YOU STOP? WILL YOU STOP ACTING LIKE A HOST AT A BANQUET? PAUL, PLEASE LISTEN-- CHINIK, ACCEPT MY THANKS FOR THE THREE BOOKS YOU GAVE ME WHEN I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD, AND FOR THE TRIP TO THE CARNIVAL, AND FOR PLAYING CHECKERS WITH MY FATHER. BUT REMEMBER, I OWE YOU FOR MUCH MORE THAN THAT. I OWE YOU FOR THIS, HUH? AND FOR THE LEAD COLOR OF MY SKIN, I OWE YOU! GOD FORGIVE HIM. GOD FORGIVE MY SON PAUL. GOD FORGIVE HIM. Paul: YOU'RE ADDRESSING GOD? GOD CAN'T HEAR YOU. GOD HAS LEFT THE PREMISES. HE HAS NEW FRIENDS NOW. HE LIVES IN BERCHTESGADEN AT THE ELBOW OF A PAPER HANGER. WE ARE JEWS. KINDLY DON'T FORGET THAT. WE ARE JEWS, AND ALL THE WINE AND BREAD, AND ALL THE CANNED FISH IN THE WORLD ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE THAT. ADAM... BE GENTLE WITH HIM. HE'S BEEN SCARRED ENOUGH FOR ONE LIFETIME. ( door closes ) SO, WHAT DO I KEEP TELLING THEM, RABBI? IF THEY ARE ELDERLY, THEY HAVE NO CHANCE AT ALL. IF THEY ARE SICK, WELL, YOU MIGHT AS WELL DIE. ONLY THE FIT, ONLY THE HEALTHY ONES, ONLY THE STRONG. LIKE YOU. STRONG LIKE KOHN THE BUTCHER. YEAH, LIKE THE KOHN THE BUTCHER. THEY WON'T TAKE KOHN. EMMANUEL. RABBI, YOU LISTEN TO KOHN THE BUTCHER, YOU WIND UP IN A TRUCK JUST LIKE THEM. YOU WANT SALVATION? YOU WANT SALVATION, RABBI? YOU HAVE A HIDING PLACE BUILT. THAT'S THE ANSWER. GET A GOOD CARPENTER, AND PLAN A PLACE TO HIDE. RABBI. RABBI! BEHIND THE STOVE IN THE KITCHEN--A SMALL ROOM CARVED OUT WITH FOOD AND WATER. SHEMA YISRAEL ADONAI ELOHEINU, ADONAI ECHAD. I'M EXAMINING THE POSSIBILITIES NOW. THERE'S THE POSSIBILITY OF OF DROPPING THE CEILING DOWN AND MAKING A CRAWLSPACE WHERE A MAN CAN LIE FLAT. NOBODY WOULD KNOW. NOBODY WOULD SEE YOU. RABBI, RABBI-- ( indistinct chatter ) AN IDIOT! AN IDIOT WHO BUILDS ROOMS INSIDE OF HIS MIND. RABBI... THIS ROOM, THAT ROOM. THIS ROOM BEHIND THE STALL. THAT ROOM UP IN THE CEILING. YOU! KOHN THE BUTCHER! WHO RUNS AROUND PUMPING HIS CHEST ALL DAY! RAVE ON, LITTLE EMMANUEL. RAVE ON A LITTLE MORE. ( all shouting ) ENOUGH, NOW! ENOUGH, NOW! ENOUGH! YOU HAVE ENERGY, SO MUCH ENERGY! USE IT TO PRAY! PRAY! ( accordion playing ) ( girl singing in Yiddish ) ( coughing ) ( knock on door ) DON'T WORRY. THE GERMANS DON'T BOTHER TO KNOCK. COME IN! RABBI, COULD YOU COME? HER SON HAS COME HOME, TOO, RABBI--FAYVEL. FAYVEL HAS COME HOME. BORUCH DAYAN EMES. BLESSED IS THE TRUE JUDGE. OH, GOD... IF YOU CANNOT DELIVER US AND SEND US MORE TEARS, BECAUSE WARSAW IS RUNNING DRY. I HAVE LEARNED ALL THE LAMENTS, ALL THE LITANIES, ALL THE DIRGES BY HEART. I'VE BECOME A VERY PROFICIENT MOURNER. BUT, GOD... I HAVE RUN OUT OF TEARS. I HAVE SIMPLY-- SIMPLY RUN OUT OF TEARS. OH, GOOD, YOU'RE HERE. I WAS COMING TO SAY GOOD-BYE. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I'M TAKING A TRAIN AT THE UMSCHLAGPLATZ. I'M GETTING A JOB IN THE EAST SOMEWHERE. YOU SHOULD DO IT. IF YOU GO VOLUNTARILY, YOU GET THREE KILOS OF BREAD AND A JAR OF MARMALADE. IT'S WONDERFUL! WHAT JOB? I DON'T KNOW, BUT... THEY WOULDN'T WASTE FOOD IF THEY WERE GOING TO KILL YOU, NOW, WOULD THEY? N-NO, GINA. DON'T BELIEVE THEM. PLEASE DON'T. I'M SO TIRED OF BEING HUNGRY. DON'T FORGET ME. RABBI, TAKE A MINUTE. LATER, LATER. ( overlapping chatter ) MY SON, PLEASE-- HE'S GOING TO DIE. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? JOSHUA PEARL, MY SON. JOSHUA PEARL. ALL RIGHT. ADAM HELLER. THERE ARE REQUESTS, COUNCILMAN, TO CHECK THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE FOLLOWING NAMES-- RABBI, THERE ARE THOUSANDS. YOU KNOW THAT. I KNOW. THOUSANDS. WE ASK, WE ASK. CONTINUE TO ASK. CONTINUE. BUT THERE ARE NO ANSWERS. THE NAMES ARE AS FOLLOWS-- MENACHEN, PULS, ISAAC, LEHMANN, ZNICZ. PLEASE WRITE IT OUT. ANNA GRINPANZ. ANNA GRINPANZ. DAVID PULS. DAVID PULS. JOSHUA ROSENHEIM. ROSENHEIM, PLEASE. ROSENHEIM. HEIM, HEIM, HEIM. LET ME SEE. AND YULA RUTECK. COUNCIL, YOU CAN ADJOURN NOW. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? RUTECK! WRITE IT! WRITE IT! RABBI, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? THE PROCEEDINGS ARE OVER. PEOPLE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD ARE RUNNING OUT OF FOOD. SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT BRINGING FOOD. ON SIENNA STREET LAST NIGHT, THERE WERE 12 PEOPLE PICKED UP WHO LITERALLY DIED OF STARVATION. YOU JEWS AND YOUR COMPLAINTS. NO, NO, NO COMPLAINTS. IT'S A SIMPLE STATEMENT OF CONDITIONS. SIMPLE STATEMENT OF CONDITIONS. THERE'S NO COAL TO HEAT WITH, NOT ENOUGH CLOTHING, NO MEDICINE FOR THE SICK, NOT ENOUGH ROOMS TO HOUSE PEOPLE, AND YET YOU KEEP SENDING HORDES OF REFUGEES INTO THE AREA. HAS ANYONE TOLD THE GERMAN HIGH COMMAND OF THE NUMBER OF DEATHS FROM TYPHUS IN THE PAST FOUR WEEKS? RABBI, THE GERMAN HIGH COMMAND IS NOT INTERESTED IN THE MORTALITY RATE OF THE HEBREWS, NOR IN THE DISEASES THAT THEY BRING ON THEMSELVES FROM THEIR OWN FILTH. THE FILTH IS NOT OF OUR MAKING, SIR. PLEASE, DON'T BE TIRESOME, OR I SHALL BE FORCED TO HANG YOU UP NAKED BY YOUR THUMBS... WHICH IS HARDLY A DIGNIFIED POSITION FOR SO PIOUS A GENTLEMAN AS YOU. THE COUNCIL WILL ADJOURN NOW. ( overlapping chatter ) HER THREE-YEAR-OLD BROTHER, RABBI--THROWN THROUGH A WINDOW. THE OFFICER WAS DRUNK. RABBI. YOU SAID LATER. IT'S LATER. HEH. IBN GABIROL. AND A GOOD EDITION. "MY HEART IS IN THE EAST, AND I IN THE UTTERMOST WEST." HOW GOES IT, RABBI? HOW GOES IT, DOCTOR? HARD QUESTION TO ANSWER. I'VE BEEN GONE AN HOUR. THERE COULD BE 20 DEATHS, 100 TRAGEDIES. THE WORLD CAN END IN AN HOUR. OUR FRUSTRATIONS ARE IDENTICAL, RABBI. YOU WITH THE SOULS, ME WITH THE BODIES. MY DAY STARTS AT 6:00 IN THE MORNING AND DOESN'T FINISH UNTIL CURFEW. IT'S LIKE TRYING TO EMPTY THE OCEAN WITH A TEASPOON. KOHN HAS IT NOW--THE TYPHUS. KOHN? KOHN THE BUTCHER? KOHN THE BUTCHER-- BUILT LIKE AN OX. BUT GERMS ARE NOT PARTICULAR, RABBI. ( sighs ) KOHN WILL SOON NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH TO LIFT HIS OWN ARM. HE'LL DIE LIKE ALL THE OTHERS. ( coughing ) IT'S--IT'S NOT THE TYPHUS, RABBI. IT'S JUST A COLD. ( coughs ) THE QUACK WHO WAS HERE-- I TOLD HIM THE SAME THING. IT'S SIMPLY A COLD. ( coughing ) EMMANUEL? KOHN IS ILL NOW. DID YOU KNOW? RABBI, I'VE GOT AN IDEA LIKE NOBODY IN THE WORLD EVER GOT. RABBI, I CAN GET IN THIS CRAWLSPACE. I GET BEHIND IT, THEN I TAKE AND PUT THEM ONE BY ONE JUST LIKE THAT, THEN PUT THE CARPET AND THE FABRICS HERE. IT'LL LOOK LIKE JUST ANY WALL. ( continues indistinctly ) KOHN? IT'S ALL RIGHT, PAUL. IT'S PAPA. I HAVE GOOD NEWS, PAPA. PAUL HAS GOTTEN AN IDENTIFICATION CARD FORGED. DID YOU HEAR, PAPA? I HAVE AN IDENTIFICATION CARD NOW. IDENTIFICATION CARD-- THAT'S FINE, PAUL, FINE. AT THAT COUNCIL TODAY, THERE WAS A LITTLE GIRL WHOSE MOTHER HAD BEEN MURDERED IN FRONT OF HER. A GERMAN OFFICER HAD THROWN HER BABY BROTHER OUT OF A FOUR-STORY WINDOW, AND THE MOTHER--THE MOTHER WENT AFTER HIM WITH A KNIFE. THEY SHOT HER... IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE GIRL. THE EYES. I-- I CAN STILL SEE THE EYES. YOU KNOW WHAT TRUE JUSTICE WOULD BE? TEN OF THEIRS FOR ONE OF OURS. TAKE TEN GERMAN BABIES, THROW THEM OUT THE SAME WINDOW, SMASH THEIR SKULLS IN THE SAME PAVEMENT. THAT, PAPA, IS JUSTICE. NO, THAT'S THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE NAZI, PAUL. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. IN TREBLINKA, THERE WAS A DETACHMENT OF HITLER YOUTH. SOME OF THEM WERE ONLY EIGHT OR NINE YEARS OLD. THEY WERE THERE FOR-- FOR TRAINING. THEY HAD REAL PISTOLS, THESE CHILDREN. AND EVERY DAY, WE PRISONERS WERE MARCHED INTO THE CENTRAL COMPOUND. AND SOMETIMES, ONE OF THESE CHILDREN WOULD SHOOT A PRISONER. THERE WAS GREAT LAUGHTER, AND EVERYONE SHOOK HIS HAND AND CONGRATULATED HIM. AND THEN ONE DAY-- ONE DAY, ONE OF THESE BOYS WAS WALKING PAST OUR BARRACKS BY HIMSELF. TWO OF THE PRISONERS GRABBED HIM AND PULLED HIM INSIDE. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID TO HIM? A CHILD, PAUL. NOT WHEN THEY FINISHED WITH HIM, HE WAS NO LONGER A CHILD. HE WAS NO LONGER HUMAN. THEY TOOK US OUT OF THE BARRACKS-- NO MORE. THE POINT, PAPA, IS THAT THEY DIED FEELING SOME ACCOMPLISHMENT. IF I COULD THROW A GERMAN BABY OUT THE WINDOW, I WOULD FEEL ACCOMPLISHMENT. NOT IN THE BIBLE, PAPA. YOU WON'T FIND IT IN THE BIBLE. WE HAVE NEW RULES NOW. ( man singing on radio ) YOU CALLED ME, SIR? YES, I CALLED YOU. WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK, LOTT? THANK YOU, SIR. I'D ENJOY ONE. GO AHEAD, USE THE BOTTLE. I ASSURE YOU, I HAVE NO COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. UNLESS BOREDOM IS A DISEASE, AND GOD KNOWS IT'S AN AFFLICTION OF SOME KIND. GO ON, DRINK. ( laughs ) DELICIOUS, HUH? GUARANTEED 24 HOURS OLD. IT WAS MADE IN A SWILL BY SOME DIRTY, THIEVING LITTLE POLE WHO MAKES A FORTUNE OUT OF CHEATING THE REICH. SIT DOWN. GOD, I HATE EUROPEANS FROM THE EAST. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE ALL ALIKE. THE FILTH OF ANIMALS, THE CUPIDITY OF MONEY-GRUBBING PEASANTS. YOU DON'T CONQUER A PEOPLE LIKE THIS. CONQUEST IS FOR THE CIVILIZED. ARE YOU BORED, TOO, LOTT? HMM? SOMEWHAT, SIR. IT'S THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR VICTORY. NOBODY EVER GOT BORED DURING A RETREAT. DRINK. MY POOR YOUNG SERGEANT. FATHER, DIPLOMATIC CORPS. BROUGHT UP IN SWITZERLAND. HE READS VON CLAUSEWITZ AT HIS FATHER'S KNEE. THE SHELTERED, INSULATED IMMUNITY OF THE HIGH-BORN PRUSSIAN TRADITION. ( clicks heels together ) AND SENSITIVE, TOO. AN EXTREMELY SENSITIVE YOUNG SERGEANT... WHO DOESN'T HIT OLD RABBIS, DOES HE? THIS IS OFFENSIVE TO YOU, ISN'T IT? ACTUALLY, I HADN'T GIVEN IT MUCH THOUGHT. BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU, CAPTAIN, I HAVE NO LOVE FOR JEWS. THEY ARE COMMUNISTS, THEY ARE CHEATS, AND THEY ARE SUBHUMAN. THEY--THEY REALLY ARE. HATH NOT A JEW EYES, LOTT? HATH NOT A JEW HANDS? IF YOU PRICK US, DO WE NOT BLEED? ( laughs ) SURPRISINGLY TASTEFUL FOR A JEWISH TRINKET, HMM? HMM. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT JEWS, LOTT. THEY ARE CONVENIENT. THEY ARE ACCESSIBLE. THEY ARE VERY PROFICIENT VICTIMS. BUT WE NEED THEM. THE JEWS, I MEAN. WE NEED THEM BECAUSE WE NEED TO HATE. THEY'RE OUR STIMULUS, THEY FIRE US UP. THIS IS THE KEY TO CONQUEST, YOU SEE--GIVE YOUR PEOPLE SOMEONE TO HATE, THEN STAND ASIDE WHILE THEY PUSH THE BORDERS BACK. OUTRAGE AND INDIGNATION ARE THE TWO MOST PERISHABLE COMMODITIES KNOWN TO MAN. THE MEMORY OF WHAT WE DO HERE IN THE GHETTO WILL DECAY LIKE A FILTHY, ROTTEN CORPSE, AND ALL THAT WILL REMAIN WILL BE A MATHEMATICAL STATISTIC-- SO MANY GERMANS DIED KILLING SO MANY JEWS SO THAT GERMANY COULD CONQUER. WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY, LOTT? HMM? HMM? WHAT ABOUT IT, SERGEANT LOTT? I CAN'T HIT OLD MEN. HMM. MAYBE YOU'D BETTER HAVE ANOTHER DRINK. ( chuckles ) DRINK ENOUGH OF THIS STUFF, IT WILL ULTIMATELY MAKE YOU A VERY SICK SOLDIER INDEED. BUT IF YOU'RE FORTUNATE, AS IN MY CASE, IT CAN SOMETIMES GIVE YOU DREAMS, FANTASIES--ALL ABOUT WOMEN. AND ONE IN PARTICULAR. THAT JEWESS-- THE DAUGHTER OF THE RABBI. RACHEL? YEAH, RACHEL. GOOD BIBLICAL NAME. RACHEL THE JEWESS. BRING HER HERE. SIR... I WANT SOMETHING BESIDES THE COLD WIND IN HERE. I WANT SOMETHING WITH FLESH ON IT, SOMETHING TO BURY MYSELF AGAINST. I WANT THE GIRL, LOTT. BRING HER HERE. CAPTAIN, THIS GIRL ISN'T-- I MEAN, THIS GIRL IS SO YOUNG. OF COURSE. I SHALL BRING HER HERE, CAPTAIN. ( clicks heels together ) ( door closes ) PAPA! RACHEL. HERR SERGEANT. WHAT AM I WANTED FOR? I HAVE NO IDEA, MISS. MY COMMANDANT HAS ASKED TO SEE YOU--THIS IS ALL THAT I KNOW. NOW, BE GOOD ENOUGH TO GET IN THE CAR. PERHAPS-- PERHAPS HE'LL BE ASLEEP BY NOW. PERHAPS HE WON'T EVEN REMEMBER THAT HE HAD ASKED FOR YOU. HE'S VERY DRUNK. YES. HE MIGHT EVEN BE ASLEEP BY NOW. YOU NEEDN'T LOOK AT ME ACCUSINGLY. THIS IS NOT MY IDEA. I CAN ASSURE YOU THIS WAS NOT MY IDEA. I'M A SERGEANT OF THE GERMAN ARMY. I AM A SERGEANT... NOT A PROCURER. ( door opens ) PAPA, I SAW RACHEL. THEY'VE GOT RACHEL. AN INTERVIEW. JUST AN INTERVIEW. THAT'S WHAT THE SOLDIER SAID. SOME QUESTIONS OR SOMETHING. SHE SHOULD BE BACK IN AN HOUR. PAUL, I MEAN, IF THERE SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS-- IF IT WAS TO BE A CAMP OR SOMETHING-- THEY WOULD HAVE PICKED UP A LOT OF PEOPLE. DON'T YOU AGREE? YOU LET THEM TAKE HER. LET THEM? I CAN INVOKE THE NAME OF GOD. BUT I'M NOT GOD. THEY JUST TOOK HER OFF IN A CAR. AND YOU COULD'VE DONE MORE? WITH FORGED IDENTIFICATION PAPERS? I WOULD HAVE LOST YOU BOTH. NO, THERE WAS NOTHING-- NOTHING ANYONE COULD DO. NOTHING. DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU, WHILE YOU SIT THERE DRINKING YOUR TEA, WHAT MUST BE HAPPENING? THERE'S AN OLD PROVERB. IF YOU SING THROUGH THE SUMMER, YOU WILL WEEP THROUGH THE WINTER. THIS WILL BE A VERY LONG WINTER, A VERY COLD WINTER. I WISH RACHEL HAD A WARMER COAT. HER COAT IS-- IT'S SO THIN. IT'S THIS WAY. HERE. ( clicks heels together ) TAKE HER AWAY. ♪♪ ( grunting ) THIS IS THE WRONG ROOM. I'M NOT THE PARTY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE WEAK ONES.

( footsteps approaching ) ♪♪ ( singing ) RABBI, THERE'S TALK OF A REVOLT. IS IT TRUE? NO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT A REVOLT. DON'T WORRY. MISS DRAZIK? MISS MIRIAM DRAZIK? MISS DRAZIK HERE? I MEAN, IS-- IS MIRIAM DRAZIK HERE? IF ANYONE SEES HER, REMIND HER THAT FRIDAY NIGHT BEGINS YAHRTZEIT FOR HER MOTHER. MISS DRAZIK? OF COURSE. IT'S THE ANNIVERSARY OF HER MOTHER'S DEATH. I THINK-- I THINK IT FALLS ABOUT NOW. I MUST-- IT'S ALL RIGHT. I MUST CHECK MY RECORDS. I MUST CHECK MY RECORDS. THE BUILDING IS ALMOST EMPTY, PAPA. THEY MUST'VE TAKEN ALMOST EVERYONE. THEY MUST'VE TAKEN A DOZEN PEOPLE TODAY, DID THEY, PAPA? DID THEY TAKE THAT MANY? A DOZEN TODAY... 20 LAST WEEK. 30 THE WEEK BEFORE. ( distant gunfire and shouting ) PAPA, HOW DO YOU LISTEN TO IT? HOW DO YOU STAND THE SOUNDS? LISTEN TO WHAT, PAUL? THE CRIES, THE SOUNDS. I HEAR NO CRIES, NO SOUNDS. IT'S BEEN SO QUIET. PAUL, WHERE'S--WHERE'S RACHEL? SHE'S ILL, PAPA. IS IT THE WINTER BIRD THAT CRIES LIKE THAT? YES, RACHEL, A BIRD. I'VE BEEN HEARING IT ALL NIGHT LONG. A WAIL, A THIN LITTLE CRY. YES, THEN IT MUST BE A WINTER BIRD. ALL THESE SOUNDS-- TRUCKS, PEOPLE'S VOICES. AND THE CRIES. YOU MUST HAVE SLEEP, RACHEL. SLEEP IS THE THING. THE ROOM IS SO CHILLY. THE ROOM IS TOO COLD FOR HER. SOMEONE OUGHT TO CALL THE JANITOR. IT'S WARM ENOUGH, PAPA. AND I'M FEELING BETTER. PAPA? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M FINE, I'M FINE. WE SHOULD ALL HAVE SOME HOT TEA, PAUL. IS THE TEA ON? NO, PAPA, THERE'S NO TEA ON. THERE'S NO TEA. THERE'S NO WATER IN THE TAP. IT'S FROZEN. WE'LL HAVE TEA TOMORROW, PAPA. PAUL WILL GET US SOME TEA. JOSEF--JOSEF-- WHY HASN'T JOSEF COME TO PLAY CHECKERS? THE POLE IS DEAD-- YOU KNOW THAT. OH, YEAH. POOR JOSEF. I CAME ACROSS SOMETHING I HAVEN'T SEEN IN A LONG TIME. "IF MY TEARS WOULD FLOW ACCORDING TO MY WOES, THERE WOULD BE NO DRY SPOT ON WHICH TO SET MY TOES." ODD. I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT IN SO LONG, AND THEN I JUST-- I JUST RAN ACROSS IT. IT'S FROM IBN EZRA, FROM THE SHIRIM. QUAINT AND-- AND YET RATHER LOVELY. IT'S HUMOROUS. FUNNY, FUNNY. PAPA, DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE? I KNOW WHERE I AM, YES. THEN WHY DO YOU ASK FOR TEA? WHY DO YOU TALK OF THE JANITOR? PLEASE, PAPA, JUST ONCE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS POLAND. YES, IT IS POLAND. AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS BUILDING IS BEING EMPTIED OF PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE BEING TAKEN AWAY IN TRUCKS. YES. I KNOW THAT, TOO. ( man screams ) AND WHAT'S THAT? TELL ME WHAT THAT IS, HUH? TELL ME. TELL RACHEL. TELL US ABOUT THE TRUCKS AND THE TYPHUS, STARVATION. TELL US ABOUT REALITY. TELL ME ABOUT REALITY. PAUL, PAUL, REALITY-- REALITY WAS TOO MUCH WITH ME. TOO HARSH, TOO COLD. I'VE HAD TO PUSH IT OUT INTO THE NIGHT. PAUL, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS ANYMORE. YOU DON'T WHAT IT IS ANYMORE? BORUCH DAYAN EMES. BLESSED IS THE TRUE JUDGE. THAT IS THE TRUTH DOWN THERE. THAT, PAPA, IS REALITY. YES. I CAN FEEL THE COLD OUTSIDE. I CAN HEAR THE WIND. IT'S TRUE. CHILDREN ARE DYING IN THE STREET. RACHEL. CHILDREN... ARE DYING IN THE STREET. HEIL...HITLER. ( grunting ) ( knock on door ) PLEASE... SHE IS--SHE IS VERY ILL. I WON'T HARM HER, RABBI. I PROMISE YOU. DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM? YES. THE SERGEANT. THE ONE-- I WAS THE ONE WHO TOOK YOU TO THE CAPTAIN'S ROOMS. OH, YES, YES. I REMEMBER YOU. THE SERGEANT... WHO WAS NOT A PROCURER. BE SO GOOD TO TELL YOUR CAPTAIN THAT I'M NOT AVAILABLE TONIGHT. I-- I WANT TO TAKE YOU OUT OF HERE. I WANT TO HELP YOU. WE CAN ESCAPE THROUGH ONE OF THE SEWERS. I MAY EVEN BE ABLE TO GET YOU OUT OF THE CITY--I'M NOT SURE. BUT THERE IS A CHANCE. THERE ARE NO OTHER ALTERNATIVES NOW, RACHEL. THERE'S TALK OF AN UPRISING, AND WHEN IT COMES, THERE WILL BE NO MORE JEWS IN WARSAW. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? I DON'T CARE ANYMORE. RACHEL, YOU MUST CARE. YOU MUST. TONIGHT, JUST BEFORE THE CURFEW, I WILL BE IN THE TUNNEL THAT LEADS TO THE SEWER, THE ONE THAT STARTS AT MILA STREET. I BEG YOU-- I BEG YOU, PLEASE, GIVE ME THIS CHANCE. YOU ARE VERY SELECTIVE, SERGEANT. YOU FORGET ALL THE HORROR THAT'S AROUND YOU, AND CONCENTRATE ON ONE PERSON. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO OCCUPY YOUR GUILT. THEY ARE NOT MY DOING. BUT YOU-- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU-- THIS IS AM-- I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR. AND I ASK YOU TO FORGIVE ME. I BEG YOU TO PLEASE FORGIVE ME. ODD HOW YOUNG YOU ARE. I NEVER NOTICED BEFORE. YOU'RE LIKE A BOY, A SORROWFUL LITTLE BOY, WHO COMES WITH AN OFFER OF SURVIVAL, LIKE A BASKET OF FLOWERS. YOU COME VERY LATE, SERGEANT. LATE IN THE YEAR, LATE IN MY LIFE. YOU COME WHEN MY NEIGHBORS ARE MOSTLY DEAD, MY BROTHER SCARRED TO THE BONE, A FATHER HALF-DEMENTED. YOU SHOULD HAVE COME EARLIER, SERGEANT-- MUCH EARLIER--WHEN SURVIVAL WOULD HAVE BEEN A GIFT. IT ISN'T ANY LONGER. IF THINGS WERE DIFFERENT, IF THERE WEREN'T A WAR, IF WE WERE JUST TWO PEOPLE, RACHEL, WHO MET AND TALKED-- WE DRINK WINE AT A CAFE, WE GO TO A CONCERT ON A SUMMER NIGHT, AND WE GET TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER. I'D TELL YOU ABOUT MY FAMILY, AND YOU'D TELL ME ABOUT YOURS. I HAVE THIS LOVE FOR YOU, RACHEL. WE SHARE SOMETHING, RABBI. I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED BOOKS. AS A BOY, MY FATHER READ ME POETRY. I KNOW-- I KNOW CONSIDERABLE POETRY. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THIS, RABBI-- WE ARE NOT ALL-- WE ARE NOT ALL-- ( gasps ) OH, GOD, RABBI. GOD, PLEASE. PLEASE. ♪♪ IT'S TIME. PAPA. I WORRIED ABOUT YOU. YOU'VE BEEN GONE ALL DAY. THIS WILL TEAR SOME FLESH TONIGHT, PAPA. LOOK, ARE YOU PROUD OF ME? I FIXED THE FIRING PIN DOWNSTAIRS AT ISRAEL'S, AND NOW IT'S READY TO POKE SOME HOLES IN BRAINS. THERE ARE SO MANY DESERVING-- THE GESTAPO, THE NAZIS, THE JEWISH POLICE-- ALL THE JEWS PAID TO SPY. IT'LL BE A FEAST TONIGHT, PAPA. AND THIS MAKES YOU SMILE? TO CONTEMPLATE THE DEATHS OF HUMAN BEINGS? OH, RACHEL--YOU'D BEST TAKE HER DOWN TO THE BASEMENT WHEN THIS BEGINS. SHE IS LEAVING. I'VE PERSUADED HER TO GO AWAY. SHE HAS FOUND SOMEONE WHO WILL HELP HER. WHO CAN HELP YOU? WHO COULD POSSIBLY ARRANGE THIS? A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER NAMED LOTT, A SERGEANT. A GERMAN SOLDIER? PAPA, HOW CAN I LEAVE YOU? OH, OF COURSE YOU WILL. THERE'S NO DOUBT, THERE'S NOT EVEN A QUESTION. PLEASE FINISH PUTTING YOUR THINGS TOGETHER. LET ME DO THAT. SO, WE WILL SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR SISTER. WE'LL TELL HER SHALOM ALEIKHEM, WISH HER GODSPEED, SAFE JOURNEY, AND THE PROTECTION OF GOD. WE WILL DO THIS, WON'T WE? PAUL, A BLESSING IS NEEDED NOW. HE'S HANDSOME, HUH? THIS GERMAN--HE'S TALL, STRAIGHT AND UNSCARRED. WHEN HE TAKES OFF HIS SHIRT, HIS BACK IS SMOOTH, ISN'T IT? NOT LIKE ME, IS HE? NOT ALL SCARRED UP. NOT PITTED, FILTHY WITH VERMIN AND DIRT AND LICE. SAVE US ONE MOMENT! ONE MOMENT? ONE MOMENT, SO SHE CAN GO OFF WITH A NAZI WHO HAS NO MARKS ON HIM? WHAT A SWEET MOMENT TO SAY FAREWELL TO A SLUT WHO SELLS HER BODY TO THE GERMANS. SHE SELLS NOTHING, AND SHE GIVES NOTHING. THE YOUNG SOLDIER FINDS IT IN HIS HEART TO HELP ONE OF US. HE FEELS A SADNESS, A GUILT, A TENDERNESS. THESE THINGS ARE LUXURIES WE HAVE ALL OF US WITHOUT FOR AN ETERNITY. SO, GO, RACHEL. I'LL FOLLOW YOU. I'LL FOLLOW YOU, I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN INTO THE SEWER. GO, MY CHILD. I ASK TOO MUCH OF YOU? A MOMENT OF LOVE, OF KINDNESS? TOO MUCH FOR YOU, PAUL? IT'S THAT YOU ASK IT OF ME, PAPA. YOU COME TO THE VICTIM AND ASK FOR COMPASSION AND KINDNESS. YOU MUST BE OUT OF YOUR MIND. WHERE WOULD I GO? TO THE TYRANTS? THE OPPRESSORS? IF THEY COULD FEEL COMPASSION AND KINDNESS, THEY WOULDN'T BE TYRANTS. NO, PAUL, NO. IT MUST COME FROM US. IN A MOMENT, THE STREETS WILL EXPLODE WITH VIOLENCE. THE JEWS HAVE RUN OUT OF COMPASSION. WE HAVE A NEW ORDER NOW. WHAT ABOUT MY NEW TESTAMENT? WHAT ABOUT MY NEW TALMUD? WHAT ABOUT MY NEW RELIGION? EXPEDIENCE IS NEEDED FOR THE MOMENT, JUST AS HATE IS NEEDED FOR THE MOMENT. BUT THERE MUST BE BALANCE. THERE MUST BE THINGS LIKE DIGNITY AND LOVE, BECAUSE HATE ALONE ISN'T ENOUGH. IT CAN'T COVER ALL OUR NAKEDNESS. ALL BY ITSELF, IT CAN'T MAKE YOU SURVIVE. IF IT DID, IF THAT WERE ALL THAT WERE NEEDED, THERE WOULD BE NO POINT IN SURVIVAL. THERE WOULD BE NO MEANING. SO, TONIGHT, WE WILL REVOLT, AND MOST OF US WILL DIE. BUT THERE WILL BE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE, GOD WILLING, WHO WILL SURVIVE. AND THIS, PAUL-- THIS HAS MEANING. IF YOU'RE GETTING OUT, RABBI, YOU'D BETTER HURRY. WE'RE BARRICADING THE STREETS. HERE, YOU'LL NEED THIS. RACHEL? RACHEL. RABBI, RACHEL... THERE'S BEEN AN INCIDENT. SOME JEWS WERE ROUNDED UP. ON THE WAY TO THE UMSCHLAGPLATZ. THEY MANAGED TO KILL SEVERAL OF OUR SOLDIERS. WE ARE SENDING TANKS INTO THE GHETTOS. THE WHOLE PLACE WILL ERUPT ANY MINUTE. WE MUST MOVE VERY QUICKLY. ARE YOU READY? THIS WAY. THE SEWERS BEGIN IN 200 METERS. THE CAR WILL MEET US ON THE OTHER SIDE. THERE IS ANOTHER EXIT UP AHEAD, RABBI. ( gasps ) IT'LL BE SAFER IF YOU GO OUT THAT WAY. ( gasps ) END OF THE LINE. YOU GO NO FURTHER. LET THE GIRL THROUGH. THE GIRL CAN GO ANYPLACE SHE WANTS. THE GERMAN STAYS IN THE SEWER. RACHEL, MOVE AWAY. YOU ARE NOW, WHAT, PAPA-- AN INSURRECTIONIST WITH A GUN? GET OUT OF THE WAY. PAUL. PAUL! YOU WANTED TO GIVE ME BACK REALITY. I HAVE REALITY NOW. SIGHT, TOUCH, FEEL-- ALL MY SENSES. RACHEL--YOU MUST LET-- YOU MUST LET YOUR SISTER GO. YOU MUST LET HER HAVE THIS CHANCE. NOTHING HAS ANY MEANING BEYOND THAT NOW, PAUL. WHAT HAS MEANING IS THAT SHE GOES WITH A NAZI. THAT GUN IN YOUR HAND-- ONLY THAT PROLONGS HIS LIFE. DECISION NOW, PAPA. YOU MUST MAKE A DECISION. ( grunts ) PAUL! PAUL! I'M NOT GOING. I'M STAYING WITH YOU. GO, RACHEL! GO! TAKE MY DAUGHTER AWAY! GO, RACHEL! GO! PAUL! PAUL! PAUL! PAUL. PAUL. IT'S BEGUN. HEAR IT? IT'S BEGUN NOW. ( crying ) GOD FORGIVE ME, PAPA. ME, PAUL. GOD FORGIVE ME. FOR NOW I HAVE TAKEN A LIFE. I HAVE KILLED MY OWN FLESH. IN SERVING GOD. GOD FORGIVE ME, PAUL. ME. I KNOW NOW... WHAT IS REALITY, PAUL. I KNOW. ONE SEED STAYING ALIVE IN A WASTELAND--THIS IS REALITY. I KNOW THIS NOW. FOR IF WE LEAVE THE WORLD NOTHING EXCEPT DEATH RATTLE IN OUR THROATS, NOTHING BUT RUBBLE WE DEED TO ONE ANOTHER ON EARTH, THEN THERE SHALL BE NO BEGINNING. BUT THERE MUST BE A BEGINNING. THERE MUST ALWAYS BE ANOTHER BEGINNING. PAUL. BORUCH DAYAN EMES. ♪♪ ( distant gunfire )
