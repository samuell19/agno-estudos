A police officer addressing a civilian as 'fucker' You had your share of days on the asphalt Get your senses together, punk! What did you say? Bring it on, fucker! I'm exercising my right to remain silent Exercise what? Right to silence, fucker Starting with Futura Chemical this morning DM Construction and Hope Capital got blasted consecutively Quite unbelievable considering this isn't Iraq Kwok, the chairman of Futura Chemical Jeong, head of development, studied engineering in England He is the working brain These two got killed in the Futura bombing KB-1 high explosive It's as powerful as nuclear bomb without the radiation This small bomb can tear down the tallest building in Seoul Amazing, huh? It's a mock-up In the 70s, when the nuclear plan was frustrated the government commissioned development of this bomb but with the change of administration in 1981, the project got buried and Futura became a demolitions specialist But, after they successfully completed the final tests the developer and chairman, Kwok was killed this morning So, what's the point of all this? The point, of course... I'll lay out the points now Last year, Futura went bankrupt following the financial crisis and lost the control of the company in a merger Aikawa Masaaki, the chairman of Banzai Capital 3rd generation Korean-Japanese Yakuza boss a major player in the money-lending business Watanabe Junichi, also goes by a Japanese name but he is Korean, too He is the merger specialist at Banzai Capital Lee Do-hyeong, the CEO of Hope Capital A real vicious loan shark - Is that Kim Ju-cheol? - You know him? He's a known thug Futura sought to private lenders during the crisis Hope Capital provides the fund but where did that money come from? From Banzai in Japan They ended up borrowing from the Yakuza That's right When Futura could no longer cover the interest the company was effectively handed over to Banzai They loaned money to acquire it at dirt cheap price Bingo! But, the man who orchestrated this deal Watanabe Junichi, Aikawa's right hand man he disappeared into thin air yesterday Fishy Fishy all over Where does Kim Ju-cheol come in? He used his boys to pressure Futura to hand over control to the Yakuza We should bring in Kim and Lee for questioning But, before that This mystery punk Came out of nowhere and starts dropping bombs we gotta get him first and find out who provided the bombs The bomb is already in production? It's all fine but why kill the chairman and head of development? Uh... well... Watanabe who oversaw the merger disappeared These incidents must be connected We're looking into it further So this is... a national crisis? You could say that Call SWAT for back-up get everyone on this case Yes, sir We'll close it before the Intelligence Service steps in We're going all in Who the hell are you? What did I ever do to you? I'll tell you when it's all over Are you kidding me? Drop the bullshit Just be straight with me - Straight? - That's right, asshole Next. Destination. Incheon. Eulwang. 75-1 You find this funny?

Bring up the picture - It's him - He holds dual citizenship He flew out of Hong Kong with a U.S. Passport He's already landed I got it My hunch was right Han was speaking with him all along Who? Han's cell signal stopped at the radio station But there was the same connection from every bombing site - Guess who? - Who is it? - Wanatabe Junichi - Watanabe? At the Futura building where Jeong got killed One cell connection was made there Then, the same signal appeared along Han's trail To Watanabe's cell phone Maybe they're switching the phone on and off The signal keeps coming and going At Futura, the radio station, the construction site and in Myeongdong, the same connection was established Han is a puppet What are the mobs saying? They blame each other The suspect pool just got narrowed down It's Watanabe's job Han's next target is Aikawa Kwok and Jeong are both dead He wants 12 million dollars for the core technology? Without the core technology, the KB-1 schematic is useless Our attempts at cracking it have failed so far How do we know that he has the technology? The police confirmed that bombs found at all target sites turned out to be KB-1 Look for this face Hello This is Kim Ju-cheol It's been a long time, Mr. Kim You let us deal with the crap and keep all the good stuff to yourself? Then, the one that has the core technology is... I'll see you later It's Kim Watanabe and the bombings, it was all his work And, he gave me all that bullshit about bombings? How do I find him? I found him No, no, no, no, no Wait... you can't It's him Good job, my boy - What the fuck, man? - Now lure him out What? Lure him out Where to?

Autopsy report on the Futura victims came in One confirmed to be Kwok but the other one... The other one was? Watanabe Not Jeong? Then the bomber is? Kim Ju-cheol? Or is it Jeong? This gives me a headache Hello? What is it? We got the bomber It's Jeong He slipped out without being caught on surveillance The external surveillance camera caught him sneaking out Son of a bitch! It's not Kim It's Jeong He kidnapped Aikawa, too? Positive, sir It was Jeong Where does Han come in, then? Wrong place at the wrong time So damn complicated - Where is the Audi? - Still near the airport - We're on our way - Good - We got a problem - What? It's Han Gi-su What now?

JBK 2065 It was a pleasure doing business with you I'm sorry about Watanabe When I told him I wanted to discuss the core technology he came running to see me We had a lot to catch up on so, we sat down for a drink Watanabe had cyanide Thanks to all that money you loaned us the interest was choking us Kim paid us daily visits with his dogs Out of desperation, I handed over the KB-1 schematic to you but you didn't pay the 12 million dollars you promised Because of that money I killed my dearly respected boss with my own hands Courier service Mr. Jeong from Futura? With the schematic you got from me you'll never make the bomb I've been telling you over and over that core technology is in my head I hope I proved myself over the last couple of days Do you believe me now? Now that our deal is closed I'll see you in hell Mr. Jeong! Mr. Jeong! Come back, you bastard! Where are you going? I'm turning myself in It's too early to give up It's already too late Complete the last mission, I'll help you clear your name Fuck off I recorded all our conversations All I need to do is to give it to police Pull over You're moving on your own from now What?
