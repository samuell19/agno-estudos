Alright. We're giving you a cool finishing stitches. We can't stitch it up like this. Relax, will you? Relax! What's that sound? Did you get into a fight? Are you hurt? No, I'm fine. Teacher, Il-mae is mine, right? Everyone, bow to our teacher! We welcome you, sir. Teacher! Tae-il! Tae-il! Why are you crying on this happy day? - Then why are you crying? - Because I'm so proud of you! How much did you nosebleed this time? Not too much. Only about a bucket this big... 2 of it... You did well. C'mon. Get up. So, where is your bride? My bride? Yes, your bride! Of course! My bride just got off work. So my bride should be here soon. Oh, I see... you're already getting excited just thinking about her, huh? Teacher! Please, don't touch it. Don't be shy. She's here! Hello? Tae-il... What are you doing? Tae-il! Congratulations! Tae-il passed level 1 bar exam Did you really? JOO Il-mae! How lonely you've been, spending so many nights, all by yourself! Open it. This is my heart. From now on, I'll breathe if you tell me to breathe, And I'll stop if you tell me to stop. Stupid! You're so stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Teacher! Teacher! Dad! - For Tae-il! - For Tae-il! Always wait for your return... your apartment! I call you because I miss you! And I hear your lovely voice... Stop! This is the happiest day in my life since the birth of my daughter Il-mae! Since we're in full swing of celebration, let's have the engagement ceremony for SOHN Tae-il and JOO Il-mae right now! Dad! Yes? I wanna get married! Sure! I'm so proud of Tae-il, my SOHN in law! It's not Tae-il! It's not him He's not the one I want to marry! Teacher, you're just joking with me, right? You're worried that I'm gonna mess up the 2nd exam, And that's why you're doing this. Shut up! Please tell me this isn't real. Tell me Il-mae wasn't serious. What did you tell me before? ''Sir, I protect my woman!'' Well... you did really well. I trusted you with my daughter... Teacher. You're worthless! Even if this is the end of the world, you can't do this to him. You know he lived his whole life just for you. You're killing him. But, dad, I slept with that man. Many many times! What? I'm not a virgin anymore. That's why I can't go back to Tae-il. You worthless shit. We did our best. Okay, let's make a contract. Thank you. I'll convey your message to our president. They want to contract the agreement. Il-mae! Il-mae! Get off me! Let's go! What are you doing? It all started when we came to Seoul. So let's go back to Pusan! - Tae-il! - Come on! Let's go back to Pusan! What am I? A joke? You think you can just show up like this and cause all this ruckus and I'd go with you? Il-mae, I love you! I really do! You don't know what love is! - Il-mae! - Excuse me, sir! - Get off me! - Sir! Il-mae, don't do this. Think about it one more time. Do you know how I raised you? Why are you acting like this? - Let's go, ok? - Get off me!! Tae-il! Tae-il! If you don't go with me, then I'm gonna kill myself right here! I already gave you my heart. I can't live without you! Don't be stupid. I'm not going. Il-mae! Il-mae! Tae-il! Teacher, the sky looks awfully blue today! Tae-il! I can't believe she's doing this! Now what's gonna happen to him? What am I supposed to do now? You awake? You know how long you've been passed out? 3 days! You really scared me this time. I prepared some seafood porridge. Kang-chul left his gang and opened up a sushi restaurant. He made this for you using only the freshest ingredients! Too hot, huh? Should I cool it down for you? Give me a cigarette! What? You got a problem? No. I heard in Japan a father and daughter in law smoke together. I say, where are the morals and ethics in that? I mean, it's about liberation. Cultural liberation! We need to adopt that thinking too, right? - So what are you gonna do? - About what? About Il-mae! We'll get her back. We will. How the hell are you gonna get her back when her heart has changed? First, we gotta find out who that guy is Il-mae! English, French, Japanese and now, Chinese, too? Wow, I'd better study harder to be your husband Who beat you? I don't know. A woman came into the bathroom and... Il-mae! How about a hot cup of coffee? I'll get it. Nonsense. I'll get it. Wait here. Relax! Come on, spill it out! I'm sorry! Please stop. I have hemorrhoid. You should listen to your buddy if he tells you to stop. No, you're worse. If you're his friend, you should've stopped him. - Look! Look over there! - Hold on. I should punish... We got the wrong guy. Shit! - Why didn't you tell me earlier!! - You didn't listen! Would you like to order? In a minute. Calm down! Really? Bastard! What? You must know your enemy to win! What's there to know? He's a rich boy with tons of money! Fuck. Fuck? Watch your language! What am I? Your friend? LEE Seung-no! Age, 30! According to my investigation, he emigrated to US at the age of 12, received masters in psychology, then graduated Harvard Law School, received MBA at Wharton and returned to Korea in 1999. Impressive! Level 1 bar exam is nothing compared to him. Are you on my side or his? Of course I'm on your side. In 1999, he established Phoenix Software, which exports various games to international markets. In 2001, he was awarded for his excellence in his industry. Any weaknesses? Neuschwanstein, or sometimes it's known as New Swan Castle. King Ludwig ll, a fan of Wagner, built this castle for his lover. But sadly, they never lived together, right? I'm different. I won't spend my life only building a castle for someone I love Il-mae, I love you! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Hey, look at that cuckoo flying over there! You only know one side of a coin. 2002 Sisa English pg. 482. King Ludwig ll and Wagner were gay lovers. Eventually, Ludwig destroyed the castle, missing him Why don't you go look for a young boy? Tae-il! You!!! Take a good look at these! A dog collar... At the office... In the car... this one is outdoor... Do you see now? He has so many women, besides you! He's about quantity. Not quality! He's not a man. He's a dog! A dog! Let's go. Maybe you're too shocked to fully understand the situation here. No. It's you who's not getting the situation. I knew he had other women, but I didn't care. Because I liked him and that's all it mattered. I'm sorry about this. Let's go somewhere else. Are you crazy? What are you doing with this playboy? I'd rather be with a playboy who knows how to love me, than a kid like you who doesn't even know what love is. Nice photoshop work. Pervert. Fine! You can call me pervert or whatever you want! But what about me? I lived my whole life just for you! What about me then? Who are you? Me? An international referee. Ready? Hello? Teacher, I forgot to tell you one thing about LEE Seung-no. He's a master in judo, aikido and fencing! Tae-il! Are you ok? Teacher... he's pretty damn strong! Tae-il! Tae-il! Il-mae, I shouldn't say this as your dad, but... I think purity of heart is more important than that of body. I believe Tae-il loves you for who you are in your heart. Can't you just give him one more chance? Dad, give me a kiss! You crazy? You can't do it, right? Neither can I. Tae-il is like that. He's my childhood buddy. Like a brother. I can't even kiss him. Really? It's too late, dad. I just want to be his friend. I'm worried. He'd never give you up. There's only one solution. I should marry Seung-no quickly Tae-il! Are you out of your mind? Why are you burning your books? The reason for my existence was to marry Il-mae. Not becoming a judge or a district attorney. Tae-il! Tae-il! Oh my god! Fire! Fire! JOO Il-mae, come back to me! I love you forever. Come back to me, JOO Il-mae! Come back to me, JOO Il-mae! JOO Il-mae, come back to me! JOO... Il-mae!! ''Prepare yourself for death, and you'll live and prepare yourself for life and you'll die!'' said General LEE. Chinese textbook pg.118, line 4! Love is like a marathon! I must eat to win! Merciless bastard! You can't take her away from me! Maybe today is the D-day. They dined at a fancy restaurant and danced at a jazz bar, right? Then, he probably gave her Neuschwanstein and said, he won't be a fool who only builds a castle... then a kiss. They didn't kiss. That's not the point! With a little bit of alcohol and sweet words, he melts her heart Then with a seal of love, the game is over She becomes his woman. You really like polar bears that much? JOO Il-mae! Tae-il! You're impossible. Please let her go. Please. You could have anything in the world. But she's all I have. Please let her go. I beg of you. Il-mae! I never even got a chance to show you how much I love you. Just give me one chance! He looks just like a weasel Tonight is not the first night we're sleeping together. We've done it countless times. So, don't bother me anymore. You bitch! Bother you? I've been bothering you? How about me? You think I enjoyed packing your lunch for 4 years? And reserving your seat at the library? Do you think doing your laundry was fun? Really? It's nice to know how you really felt. Can I go now? Get out of my sight! You make me want to puke! No, I'll go. I'm so shamed I wasted my life chasing after a slut like you! What? I ask you to go to Seoul to look after Tae-il and investigate Il-mae's affairs. And, now you return and cry like a girl. Il-mae went to the hospital. So, I thought she's gonna see a gynecologist. Hospital? She has the myelodysplastic syndromes, the same illness that took away your wife. Oh, lord. Teacher, you're so light. You got no meat on your legs. You've gotten so thin. You need to eat more. I'm not light. You've become stronger. Tae-il. Yes, teacher. Are you really ok? Of course. I'm fine. It's not a big deal to me The funny thing is, the date for the 2nd exam is the same date as Il-mae's wedding date. Good. There is no reason why you should attend her wedding. Go on and do well on your exam and pass it with flying colors. Don't worry about me. I'll pass the exam... get married... have kids... then I will come back to see you. I'll never forget... all you've done for me. Alright. Who is it? Dad? Dad, Dad! Tae-il... Tae-il... Tae-il! SOHN Tae-il! JOO Il-mae! Yes? Eat well and live well! Eat well and... don't get sick, ok? If you do get sick, don't get too sick. Ok? You too! Don't get into any more troubles! And don't be so stubborn, ok? Stop worrying about me. I'll be fine. Goodbye. Tae-il! Do you know why I'm marrying him? Because he has other women. He'll easily fall in love again. Even without me, he'll continue to live a happy life! But, you can't do that. You'll only think of me and love me! Just like my dad! I can't let you become like my dad. Dad, I'm not a bad person, am I? Of course not. Like a flower... like a star... you're the loveliest girl in the world... Dad, let's practice the wedding march. We have to be careful not to step on my dress. Alright, alright. Il-mae!!! - Tilt your head a bit to the left. - Turn it just a little. My love, do you know what I did today? I went to the photo studio with Il-mae and took pictures. She braided her hair and wore this really pretty dress. And we took a picture together. She was trying to do what you and I couldn't do. Do you know what she said to me as she took her portrait? She smiled and said, ''Dad, I've a very happy life. So please don't cry when you look at this picture.'' And she smiled. My lovely child... my sweet child... Teacher, you're killing yourself. Please don't do this. The 45th Level 2 bar exam center Begin. It would be much appreciated if you'd participated in blood drive. What the hell are you saying? Of course it's our duty as his students to do as much as we can. - What's going on? - Get off me!! You bastards! SOHN Tae-il! You bastard! How can you take a test right now? Tae-il, come out here! You know what Il-mae did for you? Get off me! She... Tae-il, she's... Tae-il doesn't understand why. He's just trying to forget her because she told him to. Come on! Step on the accelerator! He has no clue that she's doing this for his own sake For the only person she ever loved... she wants him to be happy even when she's not here anymore. My love, what am I supposed to do? What can I do? I now pronounce you to be husband and wife. Nonsense! - Nullify this marriage! - Nullify! Nullify! What the hell do you think you're doing? Ladies and gentlemen, this girl right here, is a horrible person! This stupid girl... She's suffering from the same illness which took her mom away... So I can live happily by myself... So I can pass the exam and live happily by myself! Il-mae, did you really think I'd be fine? I already gave you my heart. How am I supposed to live without you? And our teacher... he's a horrible person, too. As her father... this is how he shows his love. Tae-il, why are you doing this to her? What can she do now? That's exactly why I cannot allow this marriage. If you'd known your wife's gonna die, would you've not loved her? Answer me! Il-mae! I never regret loving your mother. Your mother was the best thing that ever happened to me. Even now, everyday of my life is filled of joy because your mom! Please, forgive her. And please release her. Allow me to be at her side till her last day. - Please release her. - Please! Release her! This marriage is... nullified! Tae-il! I'm sick. And I'll get sicker. I'm afraid I won't be able to be with you much longer You can't die. I won't let you. Forget the law school! I'll study and go to a medical school I'm gonna find out a cure for your illness I pretended I was asleep and he's already snoring. Little fool... Our first kiss was a long awaited one... Thinking about our first kiss still makes my heart flutter... I love you, Tae-il! Teacher, I can't say that! Tae-il. I can't... I can't do that here. Let go of her, will you? Let go of her. Never! I'll never let her go! I'm gonna cure her illness and we're gonna live happily together till our deaths do us apart teeth fall out.
