I'm gonna send Lee a message! You know what it's gonna be? It's gonna be your head in a fucking box! Fuck you! Fuck you! Don't... Help! Help! Somebody help! Help! Help! Help! Hello? Can you please just open the trunk? We can talk about this. We can figure it out together. Would you just... fucking open the fucking trunk! Please! Mama! Open the fucking door. I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. Jesus Christ, Joey! What the... Oh, my God! Oh, oh! Who is this? -Don't you move, all right? -Joey! Joey Doyle, open this door now! Joey Doyle! Joey Doyle, open this door right now! Don't you ever say my full name in front of a stranger! You understand that? What happened to your face? Look, I don't know what's going on, but I need some answers. And by the way, I'll say, whatever I goddamn fucking please in my house! It's under control. -It's under control? -Yes! You have a girl, bound and gagged to a bed in there, Joey. Now, I want some answers. You better start talking. Look, it was just a quick gig, Ma. -What kind of the kind of gig? -The kind of gig that gets you the home on the water! -All right? -And? And I fucking took care of it like I always do! Are you trying to tell me that girl in there is a witness? Oh, my God! Joey, you gotta take care of this. -Take care of this right now! -I know! Look, she's going to go to the cops or they're gonna come to her first! I understand that. Then why is she still alive, huh? Why? Oh, my God, Ma! Put the fucking gun down. Every second she's alive is a waste of her time -and our time. -Ma! Put the fucking gun down! Now! -If you're sweet on her... -Oh, my fucking God! If you're sweet on her... you're compromised. Now, you got three seconds! Three, two, one! She didn't flinch. You know, this one time I was with Dad. He was about to do this guy. And it wasn't like he was a good guy or nothing. Matter of fact, he was a real piece of shit, And out of nowhere, Dad just... lowered his gun and let the guy go, just like that. Why? Because he didn't flinch. And I remember asking him why. You know, why him? He said, if a person is that confident, he either knows something you don't... Or? Or they have a sacred heart. A purpose to live. Lord don't want them yet. What she knows is that you ended someone's life. And even if she truly is a good person, believe me, she's not going to take it to her grave. You have 30 minutes. No screaming, all right? You scream, and it's over, you understand that? I won't say anything. Just let me go, please. I won't... Come on, Drink water. There you go. Keep drinking. There you go. Just let me go, please. I won't say a word. You got to believe me. I can pay you. Come on, have more. There you go. I don't care about what you did. I don't want anything to do with any of this. Just, please, believe me. -Please. -One more, one more. Please believe me. Please! Open your mouth. Can you just let me go? Open your mouth. Come on! I knew you couldn't do it. I'll do it after I meet James. Just stay away from my room, all right? Do I look stupid? No, Ma. You look beautiful, all right? -I love you. -All right, be careful. Lock the locks. Stay out of my room. Help! Help! That was fuckin' quick. Good man. Here. I'm good. Now, what the fuck happened to your face? He put up a struggle. He put up a struggle? Before you fucking shot him? I didn't shoot him. He gets shot, it's another hit. He just lies on the floor, beaten to death, it's a disgruntled employee robbery gone wrong. Petty crime. That makes sense. That's clever, Doyle. Anybody see? No, nobody saw. Well, check it out. That's double in there, by the way. And we're not taking a percentage out for your old man's debt this time. It's all yours. Is there anything I should know about? No. You're the man, Doyle. See you later, James. She's moving around in there. -Living things move, Ma. -Dead things don't. Fucking shoot me, you pussy. It's all sick and twisted game, huh? I know what you want. Just do it already. Go on. You follow me. You stalk me... You and your mother... You're fucking Norman Bates! So go ahead. Go on. Just live out your sick, fucking fantasy, you piece of shit. You don't know anything about me. Well, you really handled that well. Really let her know who's boss here. Good night. ♪ I wanna tell you a story ♪ Every man oughta know ♪ If you want a little loving ♪ You gotta start real slow Ed's dead. You killed the councilman? Some things just can't wait, Douglas. -What about the girl? -What girl? The one I put in there to get dirt on Ed for you. My girl. He's got a girl? You don't have a girl? Last time I checked, I had a girl, boss. Pop, when's the last time you had a fucking girl? -I have plenty of girls. -Fucking dick. It's the assistant. Like I said, nobody saw. Did you talk to her yet? I just found out that Ed's dead. She missing? Hey... I didn't say that, but I haven't had a chance to contact her yet. When's the last time you talked to her? Connor talks to her. I talk to Connor. Whoa, whoa. Is this Connor's girl or your girl, Doug? Our girl, James. Our girl. Look, I'll talk to her and make sure everything's cool. Everything's running smooth. But... tell me the next time you're gonna change the plan. Good night. Connor, we've got a problem. Joey. I need the bathroom. I can't go with you listening. Then run the water. Can you just hum or something? Whatever you think you saw... My son's not a monster. The people he handles... Well... It's inevitable they get what's coming to them. But you ain't one of those people. So he has this dilemma... His conscience. But I don't. So if it's between you and my son, believe me, it's gonna be you. And I'll do it myself if I have to. When he gets back... not a word, understand? I'm gonna let you loose for a little bit, all right? Don't be stupid. What do you know about your boss? My boss? He's an asshole. Why? Anything else? Business he was into, stuff like that. I'm just an assistant. -His new assistant. -Three months. So? What's the average length of stay in that particular position? Less than that. And what makes you so special to last that long with an asshole? -I'm used to taking shit. -You sleep with him? Yeah. Yeah, that's it. I mean, you have got it all figured out. That's me. I'm ready to be tied up again. - Put these on. - I'm fine like this. I'm not going to tie you up... -dressed like that. -Great. I love it when people threaten to not tie me up. I'm hungry. What do you want? Something gluten free. Are you hungry? No, she is. Oh, the princess is hungry. And now you're serving her? When's the last time you ever served me? Is rice gluten free or no? I have no idea. Ask her. Is rice gluten free? -Duh. -I thought so. Ma, what are you doing? What are you doing? Hey, stop! -Come on! Ma! -Get out of my way. Joey, get out of my way. -Get out of my way, Joey. -Give me the gun. -No. Joey! -All right. Fuck it. Joey, stop! -Give me the fucking gun, Ma! -Joey! -You know, I'm your mother. You don't treat me like that. -Yeah, yeah. Go sit down. Come on. Is rice gluten free? -You're an asshole. -You didn't even have a good shot. - Hello? - Connor, it's me. Mia? Jesus fucking Christ! Are you all right? Where the hell have you been? Look, I need you to come get me. Joey, wait! Wait, wait! -What, Mom? What? Wait, listen, you need to take my phone. She's five blocks away. What is this, Mom? I had to download an app. This way I know where you are at all times. -What? -I need to know where you are. Mom, I can't talk, all right? I gotta go. -She is five blocks away. -I gotta go! What's up? Guess who just called me. - Mia. -Jesus Christ. Where is she? She's on the corner of Thomas and Broadway. She wants me to come get her now. Take her to the garage on 6. We'll find out what happened before anyone else does. What we do isn't exactly legal. If this bitch runs her mouth, we're implicated in murder, Doug. Murder. She is the only one who puts us with Lee. And I am not going to prison. We may need to distance ourselves. - Mia? - Connor. We gotta go. -Go, Go, go, go! -What's going on? So what happened? I was kidnapped. By who? A guy who put the hit on Ed. Wait. So it was a hit? Yes, it was a hit. Someone paid to have Ed killed. Do you know who? Some guy named James. Or his dad, I don't know. The killer's name is Doyle. Joe Doyle. He was the one that kidnapped me. Fuck! Why didn't they kill you? I don't know. What else do you know? Not much. Just where he lives. All right. Okay. Hey... It's gonna be all right. Okay? Don't worry about it. Where are we going? To meet Douglas. You spoke with him already? Yeah, of course. Are you kidding me? Jesus. He's worried sick. We'll meet him now. Why are we stopping here? It's where Douglas wants to meet. -Here? -Yeah. -I'm calling Doug. -Just... -Chill, fucking chill. -What the fuck is wrong with you? Jesus Christ. All right, fuck, man. Come on, relax. He's coming. Just... chill. Am I missing something? Connor, what is going on? Please talk to me. Do you wanna go for a cigarette? No. Come on, just come outside and have a cigarette with me. Let's go. Get out of the fucking car! Connor, what the fuck is this? Can you come outside and keep me company, all right? -Where's Doug? -He's coming. Okay? Come on. Get out of the car. -Get out of the car. -No! Fuck. Get the fuck out... Get the fuck out of the car! Don't do this. Connor, don't! Please. What the fuck are you doing? I don't understand. Shades of gray. Looks pretty black or white to me. How did you find me? My son and I share our location. You had his phone. Did she give it back? Ma. His name was James Connor. He knew Ed, got me the job. We were close. He knew Ed. How? He's a broker. Brought money into Ed's deals. Why did he want to kill you? I have no idea. You sure about that? Why'd you kill my boss? I don't know. You... don't know? It's my job not to know. So people hire you. What kind of people? If it's your job not to know, why are you asking questions? I don't know. Maybe just want more fuck ups. Not killing me? Was that a fuck up, too? Yeah. You're losing your nerve. I lived my whole life paying off this debt because of you and Dad. I didn't have a choice. Well, now I'm making a choice, do you understand? She might be innocent, but you're not. She knows that. In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, amen. Dear Lord, my heavenly Father... I don't know what to do with this girl. I don't know why it's so hard. I want peace. For my son. Let her be the right person. Or let me just kill her. Dougie, why is Connor laying in the trunk? And please tell me why in the fuck he's dead. -You know the girl? -Yeah, yeah. Your girl? I haven't heard from her since he was... What the fuck happened to, "Everything's going to be all right, James. "Everything's running smooth, James." Everything was fine. The next morning rolls around and I still can't reach her. So I start wondering. Maybe Connor was trying to clean this mess and she got the drop on him. And now, now she's running scared. She would have gone to cops already, Dougie. Not necessarily. She's fucking in on this. You're so fucking stupid. What about your guys? Don't fucking worry about my guys. Worry about your fucking guys. What about you? What about you, motherfucker? -You fucked this shit up. You rapped for this bitch. -No. No. Nobody fucked anything up! Don't fucking worry. I'm gonna get to the bottom of this. Don't you fucking worry. -You did this shit, didn't you, Dougie? -Oh, fuck. - You fucking kill Connor? Stop it, Dougie. Stop it! You're dying? You're dying? Then fuckin' die already. You piece of shit. Did you do this shit? Tell me. Fucking tell me. Oh, fuck! Hey! -Are you all right? -I'm fine. Hey. You can sleep on your bed if you want to. Look, I'm not trying anything. Just... saying if you want to sleep in your bed, you can. I'll be right outside. I'm only gonna tell you once more. You put that glass on top of your head. But what are you gonna do? Just put it up on your head, I'll show you. Billy, you mustn't. You'll hurt yourself. Then why don't you quit wrestling with me? Good morning, Ma. Joey, I'm going to give her a chance. I hope you know what you're doing. Thanks, Ma. Doyle. I ain't tryin' to hear that noise, man. Nobody tryin' to hear you. Been a while. Yeah. Well, let's hear it. I have a situation. There's no situation too big that the Lord can't handle. Save the preaching. All right? I'm assuming... your situation revolves around... the work, right? That's what you came here to talk about? The Lord's work. Yeah. Well, then let's hear it. I met someone. Did you? I did. The path of the disciple is one of solitude and selflessness. Is this advice that you live by? No. Let's say, uh, hypothetically, a disciple of the Lord is doing his work and somebody sees him. What is a disciple supposed to do in order to figure out the situation? There isn't a situation. Unless that somebody is innocent. Correct. Well, then he says his prayers over them. And where there are any complications remaining, he disposes of them humbly and discreetly. Has the disciple done this? Maybe he took the somebody back to the house of the Lord. This is where I hang up the phone. She didn't flinch, Dad. What did you say? She didn't flinch. All right? Well, then that somebody is certainly not innocent. -No, Dad, look... -There is no situation. -Dad, just don't... -And the disciple has been compromised. -...your help, Dad. -Much more so than previously thought. Look... maybe she had something to live for, all right? -How about that? -Maybe, simply, she's beautiful. And bold and impossible to navigate. And she consumes every corner of your mind. And you don't know whether it's love or bullshit. And whatever it is, it comes with all the warnings of a premium item. Wrapped up in a bow by the devil himself, like your mother. Look, I didn't practice what I preach, and I have to live with that. Now it's your turn to choose, and I pray... that you don't make the same mistake I did. This is Joey's father. Way, way back. No teeth. He didn't have front teeth forever. Ah, he's so cute. This is his dad when he was young. Jeez, Joey's the image of him, huh. Looks just like him, I never even realized it. Where's Joey's father? He's not around anymore. Well. I'm gonna get dinner started. -Okay. -Yell if you need anything. Hello. Who is this? Hello? Hello? All right, you wanna play games? Whoever the fuck is this, you're fucking dead. How'd you get this fucking phone? And you don't know... whether it's love or bullshit. Thanks. For what? For keeping me alive. Now it's your turn to choose, and I pray... that you don't make the same mistake I did. Hey. How was your day? Hmm? Go get cleaned up for dinner, huh. Use my room? Yeah. Dear God, I hope I'm doing the right thing. Hey, buddy. I think I'm falling in love with this girl. I know it's crazy. I know. But I can't... not feel this way. What do I do, buddy?

You gotta do something about all these fucking locks, man. Jesus Christ. Hey, where's your mother? She'll be right back. I'm not interrupting anything, am I? Yeah, it's my ma's birthday. See, Joey, I got this problem. And that's, when I hire somebody for a job, I hire the best guy there is for the job. And that's why all these years, we've been hiring you. Ain't nobody better than Joey Doyle, right? Joey Doyle, the best that ever fucking did it, right? -Am I right? -If you say so, yeah. I'm saying so. So then there's this odd little thing. This... this girl, this assistant of Ed's just goes missing. Poof, gone. You recognize her? Yeah. What do you make of this assistant? Not much. But you know of her? Yeah, she's Ed's assistant. And you know she's missing? I watch the news, James. See, that's funny, because I watched the news and I didn't... they didn't mention anything. Not the news, the scanners. -The police scanners. -The police scanners. Yeah, they were talking about her, you know? The possibility that they might think that she did it. Really? Yeah, really. That's why I killed him in his office, remember? You cased Ed's office for five days straight. You didn't see this girl? You didn't know about... Yes, of course I did. Sure I did. Yeah. Okay, was she there the day of the hit? Yes, she was there. She's a fucking assistant, James. Assistants are always there. What do you want? And this assistant... She left at 5:00 p.m. with everybody else. All right? So you don't... You hear this on your police scanners and you don't think, "Hey, "maybe I should call James and tell him about this?" -It's not important. -It's not important? No, she could be hiding somewhere, scared for her fucking life. She could've stole money, James, skipped out of town. She could be with her fucking boyfriend for the weekend, oblivious. There's a million scenarios. Who gives a fuck? She's not with her boyfriend. Fucking Ed's pounding that pussy. Trust me. That doesn't fucking matter. Listen, we need to find this bitch ASAP before the fucking cops do. God forbid the cops find her before we do. She tells them she didn't kill him, someone else did, they start looking around... Maybe she knows something we don't. Point is, she's a fucking liability now, and that's a loose end. And I like my business clean. No fucking loose ends. But if we get to her first... Come on. Then we pin it all on her. We fucking leave her in a fucking motel somewhere. A few bills on her, a bullet in the head, and a fucking note explaining the trail of blood and how everything went wrong. And I think we'd all be able to sleep a lot better at night. Don't you think so, Joey? Joey Doyle? I know I would. I did my job already. I'm not asking you. I'm telling you. Finish this shit. Find this fucking cunt, all right? And our debt's clear. If not, then maybe I got a couple more loose ends to tie up. Tell your mother I said happy birthday, all right? Let's get the fuck out of here. Are you gonna talk to me? Fuck. I'm a prisoner in here, and I'm dead out there. Get up. What? I'm letting you go. I should have never brought you here. Tell the cops whatever you're gonna tell them. Okay? I'm sorry. Say something. Where are you hiding that piece of shit? Lee's gonna... LAPD, don't move. You're under arrest. Drop the gun. -What are they talking about? -Who gives a fuck? At that hour, what could you possibly be talking about? What is wrong with you? Whatever you have to say then, you could wait for the morning. Look, I'm just saying, it might be what you think and it might not... And it might not be, exactly, but it might be. And that's the problem. Adam, what do you think? Would you ever text your best friend's girl after 9:00 p.m.? -Would you do that? -No. No, right, you wouldn't 'cause you have fucking class. You guys are making 9:00 out like it's midnight. It's not even late. No, the sun's down. That's all that matters. What did it say? I don't read texts. Okay? That's not what I do. -But I do know... -You need to chill the fuck out. What about you? What do you think? I don't know. Why don't you just ask her about it? -No, I can't do that. -Why not? Because then she's gonna know I looked at her texts, -and I didn't look at her texts. -Yes, you did. -But I didn't. -Yes, you did. But I didn't. -My name is Douglas. -Jenny. It's very nice to meet you, Jenny. Watch what I do, man. -This is Connor. -Watch what I do.
